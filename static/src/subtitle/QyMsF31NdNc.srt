00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:08,171
Hello everybody.

2
00:00:08,191 --> 00:00:11,092
Thank you for attending our panel today.

3
00:00:11,253 --> 00:00:18,335
Our talk will be presented by the three of us, the holders of the three pieces of the Triforce.

4
00:00:29,721 --> 00:00:35,745
First off is myself, the game director, Hidemaro Fujibayashi, the holder of the Triforce of Courage.

5
00:00:35,805 --> 00:00:40,287
Together with the game designers, I wield the courage to tell the staff any idea, regardless

6
00:00:40,367 --> 00:00:43,089
of how ludicrous it is and how agitated they may look.

7
00:01:14,097 --> 00:01:19,019
Next, we have the technical director, Takuhiro Dota, the holder of the Triforce of Wisdom.

8
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:24,581
Along with the rest of the programmers, he wields the wisdom to realize all of the aforementioned

9
00:01:24,841 --> 00:01:25,661
ludicrous ideas.

10
00:01:31,953 --> 00:01:38,375
and art director who has transformed the world of Zelda with his team of designers.

11
00:01:38,415 --> 00:01:40,977
I'm Satoru Takizawa, the Triforce of Power.

12
00:01:40,997 --> 00:01:41,957
Thank you for having me.

13
00:01:42,597 --> 00:01:45,658
And finally, we have the art director Satoru Takizawa,

14
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,639
the holder of the Triforce of Power.

15
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,820
Along with the rest of the art team,

16
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,342
he wields the power to take all of the different elements in the game

17
00:01:53,642 --> 00:01:56,063
to create a cohesive world of Zelda.

18
00:01:56,503 --> 00:01:57,643
We hope you enjoy the panel.

19
00:02:09,986 --> 00:02:10,966
Hello everybody.

20
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:14,508
I am Hidemaro Fujibayashi,

21
00:02:14,788 --> 00:02:16,649
the director of Breath of the Wild.

22
00:02:17,749 --> 00:02:19,410
Thank you for attending.

23
00:02:24,832 --> 00:02:29,313
I am the director and game designer of the Zelda title.

24
00:02:29,373 --> 00:02:33,115
I have been working on Zelda for about 20 years.

25
00:02:33,135 --> 00:02:34,695
I am surprised at myself.

26
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,142
These are some of the past titles that I've worked on as a director and as a game designer.

27
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,743
Looking back, I've been working on Zelda titles for 20 years.

28
00:02:46,304 --> 00:02:47,664
I'm actually surprised myself.

29
00:02:49,665 --> 00:02:51,746
Well then, let's get started.

30
00:02:51,766 --> 00:02:53,806
First, please take a look at this.

31
00:02:53,826 --> 00:02:54,687
What does this look like?

32
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:10,994
At first glance, it might look like the original Zelda on the NES, but take a closer look.

33
00:03:11,014 --> 00:03:14,276
You'll notice that Link is blue, there's a leaf, and also what looks to be a brown pipe.

34
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:41,023
As it turns out, this image here plays a crucial role in our topic today of constant and change.

35
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:43,424
But let me come back to this a little later.

36
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:08,388
As you probably already know, this is footage from the Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild,

37
00:04:08,408 --> 00:04:12,612
which is scheduled to release in just two days, on March 3rd, along with the Nintendo Switch.

38
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:13,312
What do you think?

39
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:37,691
Thanks. Great.

40
00:04:41,273 --> 00:04:53,300
Okay, let's move on.

41
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,561
I'm relieved to know that you are aware of this title.

42
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:02,757
So, how did this new Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild look to you?

43
00:05:02,777 --> 00:05:05,138
Does it look like it's made a breakthrough and completely changed?

44
00:05:05,198 --> 00:05:06,458
Or does it look like not much has changed at all?

45
00:05:25,719 --> 00:05:29,283
When planning for this title, I first thought to myself,

46
00:05:29,303 --> 00:05:31,005
what do I want to do with the new Zelda?

47
00:05:31,265 --> 00:05:34,428
And then I thought, what is it that I need to make that happen?

48
00:05:50,343 --> 00:05:57,185
You may have heard this keyword before, but it was a natural re-examination.

49
00:05:57,906 --> 00:06:02,447
And the key to answering these questions were in these two concepts that you may have heard before,

50
00:06:03,047 --> 00:06:05,869
rediscovering the essence and breaking conventions.

51
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:13,791
The number one thing we wanted to do at New Zelda was to make the user free to play in a wide field.

52
00:06:18,314 --> 00:06:23,837
and by exploring the world, I wanted to experience exciting things one after another

53
00:06:23,857 --> 00:06:27,478
and to be able to capture these experiences with my own free thinking.

54
00:06:28,299 --> 00:06:31,740
What I wanted to accomplish with this new Zelda was to create a game

55
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,322
where the user can truly experience freedom in an expansive playfield.

56
00:06:37,103 --> 00:06:41,204
And through exploring this field, I wanted the user to be able to experience

57
00:06:41,524 --> 00:06:44,106
a new sense of adventure again and again

58
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:47,447
and be able to freely navigate through it as they see fit.

59
00:06:48,953 --> 00:06:56,421
In other words, this means a game where the user can think and decide on their own where they want to go and what they want to do.

60
00:07:08,487 --> 00:07:12,092
And when I started to think this way, what came to mind was the original NES Zelda.

61
00:07:12,112 --> 00:07:14,736
Doesn't this just sound like the original Zelda?

62
00:07:31,421 --> 00:07:36,583
Battling daunting enemies and scrolling across the field, and every time the screen scrolled,

63
00:07:36,643 --> 00:07:39,824
there was a new discovery to be made and a new solution to uncover.

64
00:07:49,935 --> 00:07:53,516
A game where the user can think and decide on their own where they want to go and what

65
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,717
they want to do and experience excitement and adventure.

66
00:07:55,737 --> 00:08:00,459
I thought to myself, maybe what I need to do to create such a game is to go back to

67
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:00,819
the essence.

68
00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:24,431
This is a thrilling and pulse-pounding experience.

69
00:08:24,472 --> 00:08:29,335
In this respect, the land of Hyrule, the setting of Zelda, is full of romance.

70
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,636
What do you think of this map?

71
00:08:31,417 --> 00:08:33,519
Thrilling and pulse-pounding experiences.

72
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:39,483
The land of Hyrule, where Zelda takes place, is filled with a great spirit of adventure.

73
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:41,025
Take a look at this map.

74
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:45,348
This is an illustration created by an artist a few years ago,

75
00:08:45,368 --> 00:08:47,670
who wanted to make the land of Hyrule more specific.

76
00:08:53,613 --> 00:09:03,695
This may look familiar to some of you, but this is an illustration that an artist created a few years ago, in an attempt to actually put down on paper this great spirit of adventure.

77
00:09:19,582 --> 00:09:22,585
But, please take a look. It's really interesting.

78
00:09:23,426 --> 00:09:28,911
It's a map of Hyrule, and it's something that I stumbled upon while I was sorting out assets for this presentation.

79
00:09:29,712 --> 00:09:34,657
This actually has nothing to do with Breath of the Wild, or with the previous title, Skyward Sword.

80
00:09:35,218 --> 00:09:37,139
But take a close look, it's pretty interesting.

81
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:40,563
An island floating in the sky.

82
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:45,610
There's a floating island, and although the placement is off, there's what looks like

83
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:48,212
the Great Plateau where Link awakens this time around.

84
00:09:48,232 --> 00:09:49,633
And there's even a little cave entrance.

85
00:10:10,896 --> 00:10:15,838
An immense, beautiful castle that reminds you of medieval Europe and scorching volcanoes.

86
00:10:15,858 --> 00:10:19,839
A dense forest that once you enter, you may have no hope to escape.

87
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:21,639
And of course, dungeons that hold countless mysteries.

88
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:42,140
The land of Hyrule has all the necessary ingredients for a great adventure.

89
00:11:01,021 --> 00:11:05,265
But I realized that to create a game in which, as I mentioned earlier,

90
00:11:05,725 --> 00:11:10,409
the user can think and decide on their own where they want to go and what they want to do,

91
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,151
there were quite a few hurdles to overcome.

92
00:11:13,171 --> 00:11:20,638
Not being able to move forward with an event without having followed a set path.

93
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,201
Having walls that you can't get around due to level design.

94
00:11:34,842 --> 00:11:42,408
Or it could be that unless you've gone through a predetermined set of experiences, clues or difficulty may not be appropriate. This won't do.

95
00:11:54,012 --> 00:12:00,076
And let's not forget the fact that all the solutions to all the puzzles that you've painstakingly prepared for a dungeon are all made available on the internet.

96
00:12:00,096 --> 00:12:01,317
These were all conventions of Zelda.

97
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:31,166
We decided to start with game design and create a game that is more dynamic and dynamic.

98
00:12:31,847 --> 00:12:47,035
So our first step in designing the game was to re-examine these conventions and put our sights on changing the structure of the game from a passive one, where you play within the confines of a pre-prepared mechanism, to one where the user can actively engage with the game.

99
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,423
So, what is an active game?

100
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:13,433
Our first approach was to remove those impassable walls, which were a convention of Zelda,

101
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:18,636
by transforming the walls and allowing the user to climb them in our experimental game field.

102
00:13:35,489 --> 00:13:40,473
By transforming walls, which were used to represent boundaries, into another optional path,

103
00:13:40,973 --> 00:13:45,437
it's as if the entire landscape delays before the user opens up, asking them,

104
00:13:45,917 --> 00:13:47,719
so, which path are you going to take?

105
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:53,764
At that time, I felt that this was the game design that we were aiming for,

106
00:13:53,904 --> 00:13:55,946
and the possibility of a dynamic game.

107
00:13:56,768 --> 00:14:01,811
And it was at this point that I realized this was the kind of game design I was striving for

108
00:14:02,331 --> 00:14:05,993
and holds the potential to create this active game I had envisioned.

109
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:12,497
And so, naturally, after you make the climb to the top of a tall mountain and look down,

110
00:14:12,517 --> 00:14:14,599
there's only really one thing you can do.

111
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:15,119
So, you jump.

112
00:14:28,858 --> 00:14:33,779
By introducing an action whereby you can glide through the air with an item, once you climb,

113
00:14:33,819 --> 00:14:34,820
you can fly to wherever you want.

114
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,741
I felt that this was the crucial ingredient that will expand the sense of freedom in the

115
00:14:38,821 --> 00:14:39,301
new Zelda.

116
00:14:55,259 --> 00:14:59,682
I concluded that the multiplication of the player's action times the field

117
00:14:59,722 --> 00:15:02,043
gives me an infinite number of ways to play,

118
00:15:02,123 --> 00:15:05,025
and that this is the answer I was looking for.

119
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,706
After witnessing a simple multiplication of player's action and field

120
00:15:15,267 --> 00:15:19,332
create an infinite possibility of gameplay through one movement,

121
00:15:19,812 --> 00:15:24,097
I came to the conclusion that this concept of multiplicative gameplay

122
00:15:24,278 --> 00:15:25,779
is the answer I was looking for.

123
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:37,040
Many puzzles found in Zelda games are based on things like natural phenomena or simple science facts that don't require a lot of prior knowledge.

124
00:15:57,127 --> 00:15:59,851
But with the way we had been building games thus far,

125
00:16:00,272 --> 00:16:04,799
we were using each of these individually as clues or hints to solve puzzles.

126
00:16:05,794 --> 00:16:12,480
The objects that make up each puzzle are not only made for the purpose of the puzzle,

127
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:16,203
but they are also very sophisticated.

128
00:16:16,243 --> 00:16:21,487
On the other hand, they require a lot of resources,

129
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:26,991
so this addition method is not suitable for the new Zelda.

130
00:16:27,812 --> 00:16:33,777
It's not a stretch to say that the objects that made up each of these puzzles were made specifically for those puzzles.

131
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,521
This, of course, allows us to fine-tune and polish the gameplay experience,

132
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,903
but unfortunately it requires a lot of resource,

133
00:16:42,304 --> 00:16:47,067
and this method of development by addition was not going to work for the new Zelda.

134
00:16:47,927 --> 00:16:49,048
So my next thought was,

135
00:16:49,088 --> 00:16:52,530
I wonder if I can use this idea of multiplication

136
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:55,292
and apply it to the mass production of these puzzles.

137
00:17:06,906 --> 00:17:14,980
We created a game that would be able to play with the player's actions, objects that react to them, and objects that affect each other.

138
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,888
We thought that if we could do this, we could take the game to a level where players could play it in a more dynamic way.

139
00:17:22,045 --> 00:17:25,328
make the game so that objects react to the player's action,

140
00:17:25,848 --> 00:17:28,390
and the objects themselves also influence each other.

141
00:17:29,111 --> 00:17:32,514
If we could do this, I felt that we might be one step closer

142
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:34,215
to creating an active game.

143
00:17:35,236 --> 00:17:37,538
And first, I thought I'd use this hypothesis

144
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:38,819
to apply it to Zelda's gameplay,

145
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,101
and see if this multiplication

146
00:17:41,142 --> 00:17:43,063
really makes the gameplay more dynamic.

147
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:46,146
I thought I'd try to experiment with this

148
00:17:46,206 --> 00:17:47,487
in the simplest possible way.

149
00:17:48,488 --> 00:17:56,691
So I had to find out if applying this hypothesis to Zelda and implementing this multiplicative gameplay will actually result in an active game.

150
00:17:57,351 --> 00:18:00,152
I decided to experiment with this in the simplest way possible.

151
00:18:14,937 --> 00:18:17,117
And this is what I tested at the beginning.

152
00:18:18,638 --> 00:18:21,319
And what resulted was what I showed you at the beginning of the panel.

153
00:18:22,667 --> 00:18:26,990
First, we wanted to quickly create a game of rock-paper-scissors,

154
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:29,831
and present it to the team staff.

155
00:18:29,891 --> 00:18:32,373
We wanted to make it in 2D,

156
00:18:32,413 --> 00:18:36,135
so we brought in the character data from the technical director, Dota,

157
00:18:36,175 --> 00:18:37,936
who was going to be on the stage after this.

158
00:18:38,596 --> 00:18:41,298
I thought that the quickest way to bring this idea to life

159
00:18:41,598 --> 00:18:43,379
and to present this to the rest of the team

160
00:18:43,779 --> 00:18:45,640
would be to create this in 2D.

161
00:18:46,281 --> 00:18:49,563
So I brought the character data to the technical director, Mr. Dota,

162
00:18:49,683 --> 00:18:52,024
who will be coming up after this, and ask him to make it.

163
00:18:53,184 --> 00:18:58,168
As you can see, this is a 2D Zelda prototype.

164
00:18:58,228 --> 00:19:01,390
It's a prototype of Breath of the Wild.

165
00:19:01,951 --> 00:19:05,813
That's why Link is wearing blue.

166
00:19:05,933 --> 00:19:07,394
It's nostalgic.

167
00:19:08,255 --> 00:19:10,337
As you can see, this is a 2D Zelda.

168
00:19:10,757 --> 00:19:15,640
But we used this as a way to experiment with the mechanism I was talking about earlier.

169
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:19,283
So you could say this is a legitimate prototype of Breath of the Wild.

170
00:19:19,723 --> 00:19:21,104
And hence, Link's blue clothes.

171
00:19:21,464 --> 00:19:22,425
This is very nostalgic.

172
00:19:26,364 --> 00:19:29,369
Let's take a look at this footage where we compare the experiment and the result, which

173
00:19:29,389 --> 00:19:29,830
is Breath of the Wild.

174
00:20:11,448 --> 00:20:11,524
you

175
00:20:55,636 --> 00:20:56,137
What did you think?

176
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:05,503
Great!

177
00:21:07,645 --> 00:21:09,346
This prototype does not have a puzzle.

178
00:21:09,406 --> 00:21:12,228
It only has a situation of a river and a tree.

179
00:21:12,268 --> 00:21:15,590
But the user can still think for himself and find the way.

180
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:21,257
This prototype does not include any puzzles.

181
00:21:21,577 --> 00:21:24,318
All we did was provide a situation involving a river

182
00:21:24,518 --> 00:21:25,158
and some trees.

183
00:21:25,818 --> 00:21:28,398
But the user is then able to think for themselves

184
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:29,879
and create a path forward.

185
00:21:31,099 --> 00:21:34,700
In this simple setup, there was only one rule.

186
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,060
There's a situation and a goal.

187
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,260
Can you reach it?

188
00:21:44,442 --> 00:21:51,185
When various actions, items, terrain, and reactions of the player are multiplied,

189
00:21:51,225 --> 00:21:56,188
various events occur, and the user can freely create a release and reach the goal.

190
00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:07,700
And when the player's diverse actions, items, landscape, and objects that react in various ways

191
00:22:08,081 --> 00:22:12,766
are multiplied together using this simple rule, an active game was created,

192
00:22:13,127 --> 00:22:17,732
where countless different events occur, for which the user can freely create solutions.

193
00:22:19,367 --> 00:22:24,709
Through this kind of simple, primitive experimentation, we made the call of what to change and what

194
00:22:24,729 --> 00:22:27,169
not to change to complete the basic game design.

195
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:52,193
Now, let's see how the Technical Director, Mr. Dota, realized this multiplicative gameplay.

196
00:23:17,113 --> 00:23:18,194
Hi there, everyone.

197
00:23:19,094 --> 00:23:20,715
My name is Takuhiro Dota,

198
00:23:21,336 --> 00:23:25,318
and I am the Technical Director of Breath of the Wild.

199
00:23:26,659 --> 00:23:28,981
I joined Nintendo in 2003,

200
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:32,703
and have contributed to a variety of titles

201
00:23:33,264 --> 00:23:34,685
as a game programmer,

202
00:23:35,445 --> 00:23:38,327
or through game tech and engine development.

203
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:48,346
In this game, our programmers re-examined many of the commonalities.

204
00:23:49,267 --> 00:23:55,215
Over the course of development, the programmers on our team had to break all sorts of conventions when it came to in-game tech.

205
00:24:10,012 --> 00:24:14,173
From the terrain system used to construct a massive world to things like graphics and

206
00:24:14,233 --> 00:24:20,875
sound, level design methodology, AI, animation, even our pipeline for asset creation and managing

207
00:24:20,935 --> 00:24:25,416
tasks, we were forced to rethink our approach to all sorts of tech-related challenges.

208
00:24:33,931 --> 00:24:37,654
The ways we solve these challenges make for interesting stories in and of themselves,

209
00:24:38,075 --> 00:24:39,616
but we're a bit pressed for time here.

210
00:24:40,017 --> 00:24:42,239
Someday if we have the chance, I'd love to tell you all about it.

211
00:24:51,524 --> 00:24:56,927
So I'd like to talk today about how we went about realizing this idea of multiplicative

212
00:24:56,987 --> 00:24:59,949
gameplay that Mr. Fujiyabayashi mentioned previously.

213
00:25:03,871 --> 00:25:06,213
It's actually a matter of physics and chemistry.

214
00:25:07,393 --> 00:25:10,195
But don't worry, this won't be an academic lecture or anything.

215
00:25:16,071 --> 00:25:17,912
The Legend of Zelda is an action game.

216
00:25:18,552 --> 00:25:22,394
To go back to the basics, we decided to go back to the primitive elements of an action game.

217
00:25:22,414 --> 00:25:24,735
The basic structure of an action game is collision, movement, and state.

218
00:25:43,192 --> 00:25:48,376
In its most basic components, an action game is made up of collision, movement, and object states.

219
00:25:52,158 --> 00:25:55,960
Taken together, collision and movement make up what we call physics in games.

220
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:14,949
But of course, when it comes to game development, you don't want the sort of physics you find in a textbook,

221
00:26:15,509 --> 00:26:18,250
but a kind that fits the needs of the game you're making.

222
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:22,351
We call this game physics.

223
00:26:22,371 --> 00:26:26,112
This game physics has been born from various games since the NES era.

224
00:26:26,812 --> 00:26:28,633
And this is what we call game physics.

225
00:26:29,193 --> 00:26:35,035
Since the NES era, a plethora of games have added to our understanding of this concept of game physics.

226
00:26:44,871 --> 00:27:01,876
Game physics is, in other words, a lie.

227
00:27:01,896 --> 00:27:02,397
Why do we lie?

228
00:27:06,737 --> 00:27:10,660
Game physics could also be called false physics or liar's physics.

229
00:27:11,641 --> 00:27:13,842
But why would you need to tell lies?

230
00:27:19,966 --> 00:27:23,509
This is something we do to increase controllability and responsiveness.

231
00:27:23,929 --> 00:27:26,271
In other words, to fulfill the demands of game design.

232
00:27:26,291 --> 00:27:30,614
Sometimes to make it easier to process and to optimize.

233
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:39,601
We also end up telling these lies to optimize processing power and sometimes even to increase the sense of realism.

234
00:27:41,262 --> 00:27:47,106
On the other hand, if we're telling lies, what use do we have for the laws of physics?

235
00:28:03,991 --> 00:28:06,152
I think it's so that we can build a sense of trust

236
00:28:06,232 --> 00:28:07,613
between the player and the game.

237
00:28:08,254 --> 00:28:10,115
Players encounter in-game events

238
00:28:10,195 --> 00:28:11,556
they've observed in the real world

239
00:28:11,776 --> 00:28:14,738
and come to believe in the game's particular set of rules.

240
00:28:15,859 --> 00:28:18,300
And that's the basis for the clever lies we tell in games.

241
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:35,019
And of course, the Zelda series is no exception to this.

242
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,601
Past titles have made ample use of game physics

243
00:28:38,781 --> 00:28:41,122
to make performing actions and solving puzzles

244
00:28:41,203 --> 00:28:41,983
more intuitive.

245
00:28:44,985 --> 00:28:46,125
How to tell a clever lie,

246
00:28:46,145 --> 00:28:49,047
or how to express a phenomenon unique to the virtual world,

247
00:28:49,067 --> 00:28:50,688
is one of the fun things about programming.

248
00:28:53,117 --> 00:28:58,422
One of the joys of being a programmer is deciding just how to go about telling our clever lies

249
00:28:58,902 --> 00:29:02,586
and how to best express the things that happen in an imaginary world. 今作でもせっかく広大なフィールドが舞台なので、それが生かせるスケールの大きなゲーム物理を作りたいと考えていました。

250
00:29:03,607 --> 00:29:05,889
Given that this game was supposed to take place in a vast world,

251
00:29:05,909 --> 00:29:10,133
I felt it deserved a correspondingly robust game physics that would help bring it to life.

252
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:25,949
YOSHIMASA ENJI, JPNICI EDITOR-IN-CHIEF

253
00:29:26,909 --> 00:29:29,731
On the other hand, creating a high degree of freedom

254
00:29:29,811 --> 00:29:31,472
had been an important theme for us

255
00:29:31,532 --> 00:29:33,393
since the earliest stages of development.

256
00:29:33,413 --> 00:29:36,355
YOSHIMASA ENJI, JPNICI EDITOR-IN-CHIEF

257
00:29:43,517 --> 00:29:46,177
For example, the freedom to carry any object you like

258
00:29:46,277 --> 00:29:47,718
to any location in the game.

259
00:29:48,518 --> 00:29:50,579
If you try hard enough, you can roll this rock

260
00:29:50,619 --> 00:29:52,039
from the beginning of the game

261
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,820
to the place you fight the final boss.

262
00:29:58,041 --> 00:29:59,482
But of course, in a physics simulation,

263
00:29:59,502 --> 00:30:00,962
you have to make this sort of thing possible

264
00:30:00,982 --> 00:30:02,443
in a set of complex and near infinite situations.

265
00:30:20,874 --> 00:30:29,338
The development resources associated with creating this type of physics simulation would be immense, but we were dead set on making the physics in this game fun.

266
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:41,323
We realized that if we continued using the same approach we had in previous games, we'd run out of steam long before reaching our goal.

267
00:30:44,603 --> 00:30:48,786
And so, after running some tests, we decided to use Havok to help create our physics simulation.

268
00:31:05,704 --> 00:31:08,005
The stability and robustness of the engine,

269
00:31:08,525 --> 00:31:11,246
not to mention its proven track record in the game industry,

270
00:31:11,686 --> 00:31:13,206
made Havoc an appealing choice.

271
00:31:13,767 --> 00:31:16,707
This would enable us to tell all the clever lies we wanted.

272
00:31:16,727 --> 00:31:23,089
The new action and items introduced in Breath of the Wild

273
00:31:23,109 --> 00:31:24,250
have made the most use of game physics.

274
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:28,751
This is the result of putting a lot of effort into the parts we really want to make.

275
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:36,054
Most of the actions and items we've introduced in Breath of the Wild rely heavily on game physics.

276
00:31:36,835 --> 00:31:40,658
This came from being able to focus our efforts on the elements we most wanted to make.

277
00:31:44,141 --> 00:31:45,302
Let me show you a few examples.

278
00:31:46,963 --> 00:31:51,167
First is Stasis, a rune that allows you to stop the effects of time on specific objects.

279
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:04,831
It may look as though it's simply stopped, but internally the object is working hard

280
00:32:04,871 --> 00:32:05,612
to maintain its stasis.

281
00:32:05,672 --> 00:32:07,633
It's the law of conservation of energy, except really that's a lie.

282
00:32:25,442 --> 00:32:29,564
It feels right in the moment it happens, but makes less sense the more you stop and think

283
00:32:29,604 --> 00:32:29,844
about it.

284
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:32,765
Game physics are at their best when they let you create things like this that can't exist

285
00:32:32,805 --> 00:32:33,986
in reality.

286
00:32:46,765 --> 00:32:51,147
Next up is Magnesis, a rune which allows you to move metal objects at will.

287
00:33:08,949 --> 00:33:11,852
It looks like magnetism, but it isn't actually.

288
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:14,114
Instead, it's something like magnetism.

289
00:33:14,655 --> 00:33:16,938
The point here is to prevent instability

290
00:33:16,978 --> 00:33:18,399
from a programming perspective

291
00:33:18,459 --> 00:33:20,922
without sacrificing control for the player.

292
00:33:25,808 --> 00:33:27,069
And here's the rock climbing

293
00:33:27,129 --> 00:33:29,191
that Mr. Fujibayashi also mentioned.

294
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:34,423
We have connected the link to the wall by creating a constant between the link and the wall.

295
00:33:34,463 --> 00:33:39,547
This implementation is done by a programmer, and thanks to this, it is now possible to climb objects that move.

296
00:33:39,607 --> 00:33:42,729
The part that solves the constant is made into a haboku.

297
00:33:44,565 --> 00:33:49,587
By creating a dynamic constraint between Link and the surface he's climbing, we connect him to it.

298
00:33:50,307 --> 00:33:54,108
The programmer in charge of this climbing movement really focused on getting it right,

299
00:33:54,328 --> 00:33:59,089
and thanks to that effort, we were able to make Link climb moving objects in a satisfying way.

300
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:03,491
And it's Havoc that did the work of solving the issue of constraint for us.

301
00:34:05,191 --> 00:34:08,172
The act of cutting down a tree is made possible by a false sort of destruction.

302
00:34:08,712 --> 00:34:12,773
The act of cutting down a tree is made possible by a false sort of destruction.

303
00:34:18,267 --> 00:34:22,530
The moment the tree begins to fall, it transforms into a log object.

304
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:27,874
When the log falls into the water, it floats. This ability to float in water holds an important

305
00:34:27,914 --> 00:34:29,055
meaning for game design.

306
00:34:42,477 --> 00:34:44,238
When an object floats in the game,

307
00:34:44,358 --> 00:34:46,198
it means you've invented a unique,

308
00:34:46,438 --> 00:34:48,019
but illusory kind of floating.

309
00:34:55,321 --> 00:34:56,982
Now, I'd like to get back to the theme

310
00:34:57,082 --> 00:35:00,163
of multiplicative gameplay that Mr. Fujibayashi mentioned.

311
00:35:01,043 --> 00:35:02,743
As we tried to think of a game physics,

312
00:35:02,803 --> 00:35:03,424
we realized one thing.

313
00:35:03,444 --> 00:35:05,944
If we connect the world with consistent physics,

314
00:35:05,964 --> 00:35:07,505
we'll want to try more and more things.

315
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:16,363
In our various experiments of trial and error with game physics, there was one thing that we noticed.

316
00:35:17,004 --> 00:35:20,707
If you unify your game world with a set of consistent physics rules,

317
00:35:21,027 --> 00:35:24,449
the player will come up with ideas for all sorts of things they want to try.

318
00:35:24,469 --> 00:35:29,433
So for example, this metal slab is placed here to allow you to cross this river.

319
00:35:40,398 --> 00:35:45,441
But once you pick it up, you might find yourself suddenly wanting to try dropping it on top of an enemy.

320
00:35:51,603 --> 00:35:55,465
Once you see that log floating on the river, it's natural to want to try jumping on it.

321
00:35:56,245 --> 00:36:00,167
Just riding a log down a river seems like it would be fun. You might remember this from the prototype earlier.

322
00:36:16,585 --> 00:36:22,767
動くものにも登れるということは、巨大な敵の体に登れたらどういう戦いが作れるか。 And if you can climb moving objects, what sort of battle would unfold if you were fighting a giant enemy that you could climb? ステーシスで勢いをつけたオブジェクトに登ると、さて何が起きるか。

323
00:36:28,709 --> 00:36:32,931
What would happen if you climbed an object that you'd charged up with energy using stasis?

324
00:36:36,804 --> 00:36:46,208
YOSHIMASA ENJI, JR.: My point is that I ended up getting

325
00:36:46,368 --> 00:36:47,708
flooded with ideas like this.

326
00:36:48,488 --> 00:36:50,509
My excitement was coming not from my perspective

327
00:36:50,609 --> 00:36:52,250
as a developer, but as a player.

328
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:56,972
YOSHIMASA ENJI, JR.: What if I tried that?

329
00:36:57,172 --> 00:36:58,232
Or wait, maybe this.

330
00:36:59,722 --> 00:37:04,445
This would be a world where combining simple elements could produce complex results, where

331
00:37:04,505 --> 00:37:08,046
you'd feel the thrill of imagining the things you wanted to try as you played.

332
00:37:08,066 --> 00:37:09,587
I realized that was the game we should try to make.

333
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,581
Now, I'd like to switch topics a bit.

334
00:37:37,141 --> 00:37:39,163
These two are members of our development team.

335
00:37:46,948 --> 00:37:50,571
They're discussing just how we should go about breaking these conventions of ours.

336
00:37:51,331 --> 00:37:52,512
Looks like they're having a good time.

337
00:37:58,259 --> 00:37:59,820
This must be a heartfelt conversation.

338
00:38:05,004 --> 00:38:09,347
Okay now it looks like things are really heating up.

339
00:38:10,027 --> 00:38:12,709
It was during this discussion that a certain key word was born.

340
00:38:12,729 --> 00:38:18,112
If physics engines are such a thing, why don't you ever hear about chemistry engines?

341
00:38:32,596 --> 00:38:37,118
As you likely know, the Zelda series has long made use of the sort of events that occur

342
00:38:37,178 --> 00:38:39,078
in chemistry as in-game elements.

343
00:38:39,999 --> 00:38:43,340
Just like with physics, creating puzzles with solutions that reference the way the real

344
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,721
world works can help players solve them instinctively.

345
00:38:59,905 --> 00:39:02,027
We decided to develop a chemistry engine.

346
00:39:06,349 --> 00:39:08,190
So what exactly is this chemistry engine?

347
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:12,693
In other words, it is a computer that calculates motion based on rules.

348
00:39:13,691 --> 00:39:18,054
One way of describing a physics engine is as a rule-based movement calculator.

349
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:29,903
In comparison, we decided the chemistry engine would be a rule-based state calculator.

350
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:35,787
I mentioned this before, but action games are made up of collision plus movement plus changing states.

351
00:39:47,486 --> 00:39:51,427
And it's our chemistry engine that calculates these changes in the state of things.

352
00:39:53,968 --> 00:39:57,849
So I'd like to give a simple explanation of our design to show just what sort of calculations

353
00:39:58,189 --> 00:39:59,329
are being run by this chemistry engine.

354
00:40:08,691 --> 00:40:12,212
First, we refer to things like fire, water, and ice that don't hold a constant solid form as elements.

355
00:40:12,272 --> 00:40:14,772
Next, we refer to objects such as players, weapons, and other objects as materials.

356
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:33,156
Next, we call solid objects like trees and rocks,

357
00:40:33,717 --> 00:40:37,138
even the player character and weapons, materials.

358
00:40:42,261 --> 00:40:47,003
The chemistry engine uses these things to make its calculations based on three simple rules.

359
00:40:48,784 --> 00:40:49,624
First up is rule one.

360
00:40:49,904 --> 00:40:51,805
Elements can change the state of materials.

361
00:41:00,263 --> 00:41:02,184
So the leaves on the tree burn up and disappear.

362
00:41:04,205 --> 00:41:04,726
Next is rule two.

363
00:41:04,746 --> 00:41:06,427
Elements are able to change each other's states.

364
00:41:06,447 --> 00:41:08,568
So the fire disappeared when it came in contact

365
00:41:08,588 --> 00:41:09,028
with the water.

366
00:41:25,403 --> 00:41:30,826
And finally, rule three, materials cannot influence each other's states.

367
00:41:35,269 --> 00:41:36,910
So you can see neither of them changed.

368
00:41:39,112 --> 00:41:41,513
And that's the chemistry engine in a nutshell.

369
00:41:41,573 --> 00:41:43,915
The model is an extremely simple one, but allows for the expression of all sorts of

370
00:41:43,935 --> 00:41:44,135
events.

371
00:42:04,045 --> 00:42:15,954
Whoa!

372
00:42:16,014 --> 00:42:16,674
What's that?

373
00:42:26,244 --> 00:42:28,926
All these types of interactions in the game are realized by the chemistry engine.

374
00:42:28,986 --> 00:42:31,128
Wait, are electricity and wind a part of chemistry?

375
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:02,158
In a textbook, the answer is of course no, but in the chemistry engine, you bet they

376
00:43:02,238 --> 00:43:02,338
are.

377
00:43:02,358 --> 00:43:06,482
Aside from rigid body dynamics, we consider all phenomena that occur in nature to be chemistry.

378
00:43:22,821 --> 00:43:25,963
And so for our purposes, things like wind and electricity

379
00:43:26,043 --> 00:43:27,884
are all considered to be elements.

380
00:43:28,544 --> 00:43:31,426
Again, treating them this way gives us a simplified method

381
00:43:31,466 --> 00:43:32,827
with which to model the world.

382
00:43:33,667 --> 00:43:36,209
WAREWARE WA BAKEGAKU WO SAIGEN SURU ENJIN GA TSUKURITAKATTA

383
00:43:36,249 --> 00:43:37,029
ON DEWA ARIMASEN.

384
00:43:37,649 --> 00:43:39,771
It's not that we wanted to create an engine that

385
00:43:39,891 --> 00:43:40,971
replicates chemistry.

386
00:43:40,991 --> 00:43:44,573
IKKANSEI NO ARU OBUJEKUTO NO SUTEITO KEISANKI GA

TSUKURITAKATTA ON DESU.

388
00:43:45,854 --> 00:43:49,536
Instead, we wanted to create a state calculator for all these

389
00:43:49,636 --> 00:43:51,457
objects that are connected to one another.

390
00:43:54,158 --> 00:43:56,239
There's one other reason we referred to this sort of thing as chemistry.

391
00:43:56,259 --> 00:44:01,301
During development, we called this multiplicative gameplay we were trying to create chemical

392
00:44:01,501 --> 00:44:01,861
reaction play.

393
00:44:20,598 --> 00:44:26,801
This engine is the device that makes this sort of play possible, so in that way too, it can be considered chemistry.

394
00:44:28,823 --> 00:44:31,704
Elements can generate energy and impact the physical world.

395
00:44:31,724 --> 00:44:36,427
This is how the world is connected to the rules of physics and chemistry.

396
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:42,130
Given the right situation, elements can also generate energy and impact the physical world.

397
00:44:42,671 --> 00:44:48,694
In this way, all the constituent parts of the world we created are governed by our rules of physics and chemistry.

398
00:45:28,928 --> 00:45:31,870
And with that, we had the game that we had hoped to make, one that used multiplication

399
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:33,051
to increase the things you were able to do.

400
00:45:52,306 --> 00:45:54,888
Earlier, Mr. Fujibayashi posed the question,

401
00:45:55,468 --> 00:45:57,910
how can we create a game that uses multiplication

402
00:45:57,970 --> 00:45:59,231
to expand gameplay?

403
00:45:59,971 --> 00:46:01,632
It turns out our answer to this was

404
00:46:01,672 --> 00:46:03,914
to build connections between everything in the world.

405
00:46:03,934 --> 00:46:08,997
SPEAKER 2 IN JAPANESE

406
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:12,159
This means that everything you see in the game

407
00:46:12,279 --> 00:46:14,121
is linked together, so to speak.

408
00:46:15,482 --> 00:46:16,522
SPEAKER 1 IN JAPANESE

409
00:46:22,368 --> 00:46:24,809
And these connections don't simply occur by accident.

410
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:27,330
Instead, they're intentionally designed

411
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:30,531
to have an overall consistency and to feel instinctive.

412
00:46:34,132 --> 00:46:36,913
And of course, they contain all sorts of those clever lies

413
00:46:36,953 --> 00:46:37,554
we like to tell.

414
00:46:37,574 --> 00:46:41,575
We didn't have a firm belief in this approach from the start.

415
00:46:41,595 --> 00:46:44,256
So we took the 2D approach to make the prototyping process as fast as possible.

416
00:46:44,356 --> 00:46:45,397
And that's what we call 2D Zelda.

417
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:53,561
But when we started out, we had no guarantee

418
00:46:53,621 --> 00:46:55,323
that this sort of approach would work.

419
00:46:55,963 --> 00:46:59,205
So I used 2D graphics to quickly create a prototype

420
00:46:59,426 --> 00:47:00,506
as a proof of concept.

421
00:47:00,947 --> 00:47:03,569
That was the image of 2D Zelda that you saw earlier.

422
00:47:03,589 --> 00:47:07,411
The merit of 2D prototyping is that you can clearly

423
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:09,253
symbolize the game and build the logic.

424
00:47:09,773 --> 00:47:12,475
2D prototyping is handy in that it allows you

425
00:47:12,515 --> 00:47:14,356
to reduce the game to a set of symbols

426
00:47:14,897 --> 00:47:17,238
and clearly display the logic behind an idea.

427
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,624
As you can see, this prototype is actually in 3D, and under the hood there were early

428
00:47:26,644 --> 00:47:28,286
versions of our physics and chemistry engines at work.

429
00:47:53,651 --> 00:48:00,477
In the world of Breath of the Wild, this multiplicative gameplay is found in the space between situations and goals.

430
00:48:07,103 --> 00:48:14,390
If you can see these connections between elements in the world, the scenery around you takes on new meaning and poses questions to you.

431
00:48:18,193 --> 00:48:22,675
It should also inspire you to experiment and try out all sorts of ideas.

432
00:48:25,156 --> 00:48:27,696
We've filled every corner of the game world with these sets of situations and goals.

433
00:48:27,776 --> 00:48:30,697
And of course, we've envisioned correct ways to solve each of them.

434
00:48:41,813 --> 00:48:45,656
But that's not to say we want the player to search for and find those correct answers.

435
00:48:45,676 --> 00:48:48,679
Instead, we want them to have fun thinking up and trying solutions on their own.

436
00:49:08,188 --> 00:49:10,350
Having listened to our presentation up to this point,

437
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:13,352
have you found yourselves puzzling out your own answers

438
00:49:13,472 --> 00:49:15,214
to the situations we've shown on screen?

439
00:49:17,816 --> 00:49:20,358
Even if it's a little inefficient or an unexpected shortcut,

440
00:49:20,378 --> 00:49:24,001
as long as you enjoy the experience of thinking, trying, and completing it,

441
00:49:24,021 --> 00:49:26,283
I think that's the right answer to this game.

442
00:49:27,999 --> 00:49:33,425
If thinking up, trying out, and eventually finding roundabout solutions or unexpected

443
00:49:33,485 --> 00:49:38,550
shortcuts is fun, then I think that in itself is the correct way to play this game.

444
00:49:50,277 --> 00:49:53,038
One convention we broke with in making Breath of the Wild

445
00:49:53,358 --> 00:49:56,839
was to create a world where fun occurs through multiplication,

446
00:49:57,319 --> 00:49:59,880
as opposed to one in which fun elements are simply

447
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,600
added together in a sum total.

448
00:50:02,581 --> 00:50:06,842
Action, the field design, and the object.

449
00:50:08,202 --> 00:50:10,763
By multiplying actions with the design of the play field

450
00:50:11,083 --> 00:50:13,124
and the objects placed on it, you

451
00:50:13,164 --> 00:50:15,885
create a situation in which almost anything can occur.

452
00:50:17,216 --> 00:50:21,000
and provide a more dynamic and free gaming experience.

453
00:50:21,661 --> 00:50:24,865
I hope you enjoy the puzzle solving process.

454
00:50:25,705 --> 00:50:29,890
It was our aim to deliver a more active and open-ended play experience.

455
00:50:30,511 --> 00:50:35,636
And I hope players will enjoy coming up with their own unique solutions to the game's puzzles and challenges.

456
00:50:57,441 --> 00:51:15,444
I really want players to relish those moments where you do something and think, oh my gosh,

457
00:51:15,504 --> 00:51:16,045
I'm a genius.

458
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:29,387
Now, changing subjects, I want to show you an email we received during development of

459
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:30,208
the Wii U version of the game.

460
00:51:47,367 --> 00:51:50,250
We were given the additional mission of releasing the game for Nintendo Switch.

461
00:51:50,290 --> 00:51:52,773
And that's a producer for you.

462
00:51:52,793 --> 00:51:54,936
He has even more of that courage to say than Mr. Fujibayashi.

463
00:52:17,335 --> 00:52:22,719
But to cut to the chase, adapting the game for the Nintendo Switch was easier than we thought it would be.

464
00:52:22,739 --> 00:52:26,082
That's my honest opinion as a game developer, and I'll sum up what I mean.

465
00:52:27,083 --> 00:52:32,166
But to cut to the chase, adapting the game for the Nintendo Switch was easier than we thought it would be.

466
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:35,829
And that's my honest opinion as a game developer, and I'll sum up what I mean.

467
00:52:35,849 --> 00:52:39,032
First, the SDK really helped us with this point.

468
00:52:39,052 --> 00:52:42,934
The Nintendo SDK is the standard development environment for the Nintendo Switch.

469
00:52:45,207 --> 00:52:47,568
First, the SDK helped us out quite a bit.

470
00:52:48,188 --> 00:52:52,190
The Nintendo SDK is the standard development environment for Nintendo Switch.

471
00:52:58,397 --> 00:53:01,397
On the hardware side as well, the attributes you can see

472
00:53:01,517 --> 00:53:03,958
on screen gave it a versatile architecture

473
00:53:03,998 --> 00:53:05,278
that was easy to work with.

474
00:53:05,298 --> 00:53:08,159
I have been involved in the development of all platforms

475
00:53:08,179 --> 00:53:11,500
such as Nintendo DS, Wii, 3DS, and Wii U since GameCube,

476
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:15,561
but this was the first time I had to implement a tricky

477
00:53:15,661 --> 00:53:18,562
implementation that was conscious of architecture.

478
00:53:19,656 --> 00:53:25,858
I've developed games for the GameCube, Nintendo DS, the Wii, 3DS, and Wii U, but this was

479
00:53:25,898 --> 00:53:30,120
the first time there was no need to implement any tricky workarounds because of hardware

480
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:30,720
architecture.

481
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:37,943
When the game first started running, it didn't have any optimization, but the framerate

482
00:53:37,963 --> 00:53:39,263
was more than the same as the Wii U.

483
00:53:42,161 --> 00:53:45,203
When we first got the Nintendo Switch version running,

484
00:53:45,803 --> 00:53:47,705
but had yet to do any optimization,

485
00:53:48,045 --> 00:53:50,827
we were already seeing frame rates equal to or better

486
00:53:50,867 --> 00:53:51,867
than the Wii U version.

487
00:53:51,887 --> 00:53:55,089
And we started thinking about how to make Breath of the Wild

488
00:53:55,109 --> 00:53:57,911
more appealing to this platform.

489
00:53:58,612 --> 00:54:01,694
We also began thinking of ways to use Breath of the Wild

490
00:54:01,734 --> 00:54:03,895
to show off the appeal of the platform itself.

491
00:54:05,047 --> 00:54:08,308
Nintendo Switch has a variety of gimmicks, including Joy-Con,

492
00:54:08,408 --> 00:54:13,590
and we are very proud of the game design using these gimmicks.

493
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:16,831
But Breath of the Wild does not use them.

494
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:20,773
The Nintendo Switch features a number of unique play elements,

495
00:54:21,213 --> 00:54:24,074
with the Joy-Con controllers being the most obvious example,

496
00:54:24,775 --> 00:54:29,236
and I think we excel at designing games that take advantage of these tools for play.

497
00:54:30,017 --> 00:54:32,598
However, Breath of the Wild doesn't include anything like this.

498
00:54:40,869 --> 00:54:46,910
For Breath of the Wild, we wanted to deliver the same game design to players on both the Wii U and Nintendo Switch.

499
00:54:47,911 --> 00:54:53,972
But looking back on our previous hardware, we've always had launch titles that carry the additional duty of making the appeal of the hardware easy to see.

500
00:55:04,112 --> 00:55:06,874
What did we want to convey with Breath of the Wild?

501
00:55:07,635 --> 00:55:11,418
But then, what did we want to try and convey with this version of the game?

502
00:55:15,801 --> 00:55:18,824
It's the novelty of being able to take it with you anywhere you go.

503
00:55:18,844 --> 00:55:22,847
And without any special game design, you can get this added value automatically.

504
00:55:25,171 --> 00:55:26,712
We were the first ones to be surprised by this.

505
00:55:26,772 --> 00:55:29,993
We wanted to share this surprise with our customers and developers.

506
00:55:30,033 --> 00:55:34,034
I don't think there is a title as easy to enjoy as Breath of the Wild.

507
00:56:03,465 --> 00:56:07,268
In the final stretch, we made some improvements to graphic and audio quality,

508
00:56:07,748 --> 00:56:10,251
and Breath of the Wild for Nintendo Switch was complete.

509
00:56:10,271 --> 00:56:15,055
There's one last thing that the Nintendo Switch made possible for the game.

510
00:56:15,716 --> 00:56:17,477
This is our team staff looking at the screen.

511
00:56:17,657 --> 00:56:20,540
They're looking at the screen and saying,

512
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:21,701
This is our team staff looking at the screen.

513
00:56:23,233 --> 00:56:25,255
The gentleman you see staring at the screen

514
00:56:25,495 --> 00:56:27,216
is one of the members of our development team.

515
00:56:31,821 --> 00:56:34,143
The game's moving and all he's doing is staring at it.

516
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:58,883
According to him, this was just the most comfortable way to play.

517
00:57:00,965 --> 00:57:02,206
Breath of the Wild is a game about freedom.

518
00:57:18,042 --> 00:57:23,483
By bringing it to Nintendo Switch, we extended that freedom to being able to choose your preferred play style.

519
00:57:24,063 --> 00:57:27,785
This play style isn't necessarily the correct one that we envisioned,

520
00:57:28,265 --> 00:57:34,387
but if this makes the game fun to play for you, then that becomes your correct way to play on Nintendo Switch.

521
00:57:36,267 --> 00:57:38,868
That brings my part of the presentation to an end. Thank you very much.

522
00:57:52,505 --> 00:57:55,826
Finally, we'll move into discussing how we gave this complex world its art style.

523
00:57:55,846 --> 00:57:59,527
I'll leave that to our art director, Mr. Takizawa, the man with the Triforce of the

524
00:57:59,547 --> 00:57:59,927
Power to Show.

525
00:57:59,967 --> 00:58:00,547
Hello everyone.

526
00:58:18,238 --> 00:58:23,079
I am the art director of The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild.

527
00:58:24,259 --> 00:58:32,181
Satoru Takizawa.

528
00:58:32,841 --> 00:58:35,101
I've spent most of my time at Nintendo as an artist

529
00:58:35,241 --> 00:58:37,162
on development of The Legend of Zelda series.

530
00:58:38,282 --> 00:58:41,382
Let's start by taking a look at some of the artwork trial and error

531
00:58:41,402 --> 00:58:41,983
for Breath of the Wild.

532
00:58:48,397 --> 00:58:53,441
Here are some concept sketches of the main character, Link.

533
00:59:08,652 --> 00:59:11,755
And here are design sketches of the ancient ruins that appear in the game.

534
00:59:11,795 --> 00:59:12,375
Thanks for watching!

535
00:59:53,732 --> 00:59:55,532
Next up, Hyrule Wars.

536
00:59:58,913 --> 01:00:00,133
Link in Kyoto.

537
01:00:00,833 --> 01:00:05,214
Link in Kyoto.

538
01:00:05,814 --> 01:00:07,594
And here's an invasion from outer space.

539
01:00:09,135 --> 01:00:12,155
Yeah, this is where things got a bit dodgy.

540
01:00:14,433 --> 01:00:15,013
Jar-Jr. Link.

541
01:00:15,573 --> 01:00:16,774
Track suit link.

542
01:00:18,035 --> 01:00:18,595
Rider link.

543
01:00:19,275 --> 01:00:19,976
Biker link.

544
01:00:21,176 --> 01:00:22,017
Musician link.

545
01:00:22,317 --> 01:00:23,097
Musician link.

546
01:00:24,598 --> 01:00:25,818
Link in Metroid.

547
01:00:26,259 --> 01:00:30,641
Link in Metroid.

548
01:00:30,901 --> 01:00:32,402
We had a lot of ideas.

549
01:00:35,103 --> 01:00:37,484
Finally, this is the design we settled on for the ancient ruins.

550
01:01:00,732 --> 01:01:02,401
And here's the final design for Link.

551
01:01:30,483 --> 01:01:33,104
Now let's take a look at some screenshots from the completed game.

552
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:01,060
So today I'd like to talk about why we chose this art style

553
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:04,041
and some universal topics that arise in art creation.

554
01:02:04,061 --> 01:02:07,241
That is to say, what remained constant.

555
01:02:07,261 --> 01:02:08,322
So first, let's take a look at the Zelda titles

556
01:02:08,342 --> 01:02:09,062
I've been involved with.

557
01:02:09,082 --> 01:02:09,662
Ocarina of Time.

558
01:02:26,732 --> 01:02:28,752
The Majora's Mask.

559
01:02:30,653 --> 01:02:33,194
The tech demo we revealed for GameCube at Nintendo Spaceworld.

560
01:02:33,214 --> 01:02:33,734
The Wind Waker.

561
01:02:33,754 --> 01:02:34,434
Twilight Princess.

562
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:35,495
Skyward Sword.

563
01:02:50,682 --> 01:02:52,403
It's been 30 years since the launch of the NES Zelda.

564
01:02:52,423 --> 01:02:56,245
I've only been involved in a small portion of the Zelda titles, but even so, something

565
01:02:56,285 --> 01:03:01,368
that struck me about this long-running series is how aggressively the game system has been

566
01:03:01,548 --> 01:03:02,068
changed each time.

567
01:03:02,108 --> 01:03:04,009
I think that's a fairly rare thing.

568
01:03:20,764 --> 01:03:24,707
In order to meet this challenge, the artists have had to continually search for art style that makes it easy to lie.

569
01:03:24,727 --> 01:03:25,907
So what is art style that makes it easy to lie?

570
01:03:47,834 --> 01:03:53,379
It's an art style that suits the game while fulfilling the playability demands without losing a feeling of reality.

571
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:56,041
What is playability?

572
01:03:56,802 --> 01:03:57,783
So what's playability?

573
01:03:58,584 --> 01:04:03,148
Playability is the comfort of the game, in other words, the behavior and appearance that are in line with the function.

574
01:04:03,168 --> 01:04:07,251
What makes a game comfortable in terms of game cycle and response?

575
01:04:09,914 --> 01:04:13,456
the pleasantness of behaviors or visuals based on gameplay,

576
01:04:13,736 --> 01:04:14,757
or in other words, function.

577
01:04:15,297 --> 01:04:17,798
For a game, the optimization of the pleasantness

578
01:04:17,978 --> 01:04:20,059
of the game cycle and response is

579
01:04:23,501 --> 01:04:25,162
the most important thing.

580
01:04:25,182 --> 01:04:28,644
A reality players can sink into.

581
01:04:28,684 --> 01:04:29,524
This is also very important.

582
01:04:46,206 --> 01:04:55,128
As you move further away from realness, both tempo and visibility improve and the level of pleasantness increases, but the reality of the world is apt to be lost.

583
01:04:56,609 --> 01:05:02,031
However, if you focus too much on the realism of the movement, you will lose a pleasant game cycle and response.

584
01:05:03,813 --> 01:05:08,196
That being said, if you place too much importance on the realness of behavior and presentation,

585
01:05:08,436 --> 01:05:11,498
you can damage a pleasant game cycle and responsiveness.

586
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:17,482
So what is a suitable art style that makes these two elements compatible in a good way?

587
01:05:18,163 --> 01:05:22,986
So what is a suitable art style that makes these two elements compatible in a good way?

588
01:05:23,006 --> 01:05:25,748
That is art that makes it easy to lie.

589
01:05:26,088 --> 01:05:28,430
That is art that makes it easy to lie.

590
01:05:31,795 --> 01:05:35,717
So after Skyward Sword, how did art that makes it easy to lie have to change to bring Zelda into the HD era?

591
01:05:35,757 --> 01:05:39,520
This question was the beginning of the trial and error process which led us to the art style of Breath of the Wild.

592
01:05:59,085 --> 01:06:02,766
This is the tech demo HD Experience that was released in 2011.

593
01:06:02,886 --> 01:06:09,349
We tried to make it look more realistic by adjusting the resolution of the screen.

594
01:06:09,970 --> 01:06:13,951
Here is the tech demo HD Experience we showed at E3 in 2011.

595
01:06:15,032 --> 01:06:21,175
In response to the adoption of high resolution screens, we took a straightforward approach and filled the screen with a lot of detail.

596
01:06:30,668 --> 01:06:36,891
While doing PBR, physically based rendering tests, we tried our hand at creating common cityscapes as well.

597
01:06:36,911 --> 01:06:45,616
We threw models from previous titles into our new development environment and tried some HD mockups.

598
01:06:55,754 --> 01:06:56,615
Skyward Sword.

599
01:06:57,035 --> 01:06:58,015
Here's Skyward Sword.

600
01:07:03,058 --> 01:07:06,679
Not sure why, but the gang's all here.

601
01:07:11,642 --> 01:07:12,802
Twilight Princess.

602
01:07:12,822 --> 01:07:13,783
Here's Twilight Princess.

603
01:07:22,827 --> 01:07:23,688
And the Wind Waker.

604
01:07:36,225 --> 01:07:43,688
This new Wind Waker art stood out from the other HD mock-ups and really captured the imagination of the lead artists on Breath of the Wild, myself included.

605
01:08:00,279 --> 01:08:11,604
This art guarantees playability from all aspects, including visibility and action, and still

606
01:08:11,644 --> 01:08:14,045
allows for the construction of a unique reality.

607
01:08:14,466 --> 01:08:17,147
It's an art style with which it's super easy to lie.

608
01:08:17,167 --> 01:08:20,528
It has great originality and has remained fresh even after 10 years.

609
01:08:28,188 --> 01:08:29,128
And it feels good to play.

610
01:08:37,691 --> 01:08:41,032
This led to the official creation of the Wind Waker HD remake.

611
01:08:41,052 --> 01:08:45,293
It's also connected to something that happened one day and led directly to the

612
01:08:45,313 --> 01:08:47,954
finalization of the art direction for Breath of the Wild.

613
01:09:06,136 --> 01:09:14,040
One day during the final stages of the Wind Waker HD development process, I was summoned by Breath of the Wild director, Mr. Fujibayashi, and producer, Mr. Aonuma.

614
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:17,522
Mr. Fujibayashi pointed to a Wind Waker HD screen and said,

615
01:09:17,562 --> 01:09:18,963
This, right here.

616
01:09:27,055 --> 01:09:28,295
Right? I replied.

617
01:09:34,238 --> 01:09:39,240
The other artists and I were in complete agreement, so I did not hesitate to speak up.

618
01:09:40,881 --> 01:09:42,461
Mr. Aonuma said, I agree.

619
01:09:46,203 --> 01:09:47,864
And with that, it was decided.

620
01:09:47,884 --> 01:09:49,985
The whole thing took less than a minute.

621
01:09:53,957 --> 01:09:55,559
At the time, we were very surprised.

622
01:09:56,219 --> 01:09:57,641
But during the development of Wind Tactics HD,

623
01:09:57,701 --> 01:10:01,584
we saw how the world's realistic world was being expanded day by day,

624
01:10:01,624 --> 01:10:03,246
without losing the original playability.

625
01:10:03,286 --> 01:10:07,329
Looking back now, it may have been a natural match.

626
01:10:11,386 --> 01:10:20,253
It was really surprising at the time, but looking back now and seeing how the game lost none of its originality or playability over the course of development of the Wind Waker HD,

627
01:10:20,853 --> 01:10:28,919
plus the fact that the entire staff witnessed the solidification and expansion of the game's reality day after day, our agreement on the issue seems quite natural.

628
01:10:34,191 --> 01:10:38,997
This is a bit off topic, but here's something that supported our common belief that we're good at this type of art creation.

629
01:10:39,638 --> 01:10:45,305
This is a bit off topic, but here's something that supported our common belief that we're good at this type of art creation.

630
01:10:45,325 --> 01:10:48,529
The difference in the development of painting in Japan and the West,

631
01:10:49,130 --> 01:10:52,754
and the way of liking that transcends the generations of manga and animation in Japan.

632
01:10:53,469 --> 01:10:59,011
I think it will be a very interesting subject to consider, but I will omit it because the story will be left out.

633
01:10:59,731 --> 01:11:02,993
The difference in the evolution of painting between the West and Japan.

634
01:11:03,813 --> 01:11:13,096
We could have quite an interesting discussion if we began delving into how manga and animation art has crossed into a wider, more mainstream appeal in modern Japan,

635
01:11:13,737 --> 01:11:16,738
but that's not why we're here, so we're going to have to save that for another time.

636
01:11:16,758 --> 01:11:19,259
Now, back to the story.

637
01:11:21,091 --> 01:11:25,594
Based on the wind's tact, we decided to consider further painting.

638
01:11:26,415 --> 01:11:27,716
So let's get back to our discussion.

639
01:11:27,976 --> 01:11:34,740
We continued with exploring art creation based on the Wind Waker and came up with our final art creation slogan.

640
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:38,322
Refreshing and full-flavored.

641
01:11:50,476 --> 01:11:54,879
This is the very important art creation slogan we adopted for Breath of the Wild.

642
01:11:54,899 --> 01:11:58,582
In Japan, I think a lot of people would hear this and want to have a beer.

643
01:11:58,642 --> 01:11:59,403
How about you?

644
01:11:59,443 --> 01:12:01,825
So, why did we choose this slogan?

645
01:12:20,656 --> 01:12:23,499
There was actually one weak spot in the Wind Waker HD art style.

646
01:12:27,583 --> 01:12:34,509
An important point in Mr. Fujibayashi's game concept

647
01:12:34,970 --> 01:12:40,335
was to fill the vast game world with fun multiplicative experiences using physics and chemistry gameplay.

648
01:12:42,637 --> 01:12:47,219
And this was difficult to achieve with the Wind Waker HD art style.

649
01:12:47,940 --> 01:12:48,260
Why is that?

650
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:53,584
The Wind Waker art style, in its depiction of form, feel of materials, etc., is very stylized.

651
01:12:53,604 --> 01:12:56,425
The game's physical and chemical gameplay is intuitively reminiscent of a real-life experience.

652
01:13:10,953 --> 01:13:16,700
One of our goals was to have the art intuitively suggest possible physics and chemistry gameplay

653
01:13:16,780 --> 01:13:19,704
based on the player's own experiences in the real world.

654
01:13:20,485 --> 01:13:24,009
The problem with the Wind Waker art style is the lies it told were too big.

655
01:13:31,169 --> 01:13:36,553
Another point is that if you can understand everything that is shown on the screen in an instant,

656
01:13:36,633 --> 01:13:37,974
you will be seen as a child.

657
01:13:38,054 --> 01:13:41,596
So, you will be seen as someone who is older than you,

658
01:13:41,656 --> 01:13:44,418
and you will be seen as someone who has nothing to do with you.

659
01:13:50,043 --> 01:13:52,465
There was also another concern with the Wind Waker art style.

660
01:13:52,705 --> 01:13:57,389
The concern was if older players could look at the screen for just an instant and understand

661
01:13:57,650 --> 01:14:01,773
everything they were seeing, they might feel the art was intended for children and was

662
01:14:01,833 --> 01:14:02,394
not for them.

663
01:14:02,414 --> 01:14:02,454
So...

664
01:14:07,981 --> 01:14:15,643
Based on the art on something easy to tell lies with, like the Wind Waker art, we could more easily guarantee function conforming to playability, and more easily construct the reality within the game.

665
01:14:15,663 --> 01:14:16,403
Above and beyond that,

666
01:14:32,852 --> 01:14:40,731
A high-definition, mature-like illustration that has a certain realism that allows you to imagine what anyone can do based on the real world.

667
01:14:41,717 --> 01:14:44,540
We needed to suggest things anyone could do in the real world,

668
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:46,622
so we needed a certain level of realism,

669
01:14:46,882 --> 01:14:50,286
and we needed an information-dense, mature art style.

670
01:14:50,986 --> 01:14:57,012
Our goal of supporting these elements equally led to refreshing and full-flavored.

671
01:14:57,513 --> 01:15:02,858
Our goal of supporting these elements equally led to refreshing and full-flavored.

672
01:15:13,792 --> 01:15:17,455
So we made this our slogan, and it led to the establishment of the final art style.

673
01:15:18,115 --> 01:15:23,218
Shader, lighting, model, terrain, effects, UI, weather, and environment were all part of this slogan.

674
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:33,385
Shaders, lighting, models, terrain, effects, UI, weather environments.

675
01:15:33,926 --> 01:15:39,693
Our slogan is the foundation upon which all these sections constructed their designs and behaviors.

676
01:15:42,090 --> 01:15:45,232
Considering the tempo and efficiency of Breath of the Wild's game cycle,

677
01:15:45,252 --> 01:15:49,036
we needed a very quick response and event production,

678
01:15:49,076 --> 01:15:52,959
but we were able to achieve this in the end.

679
01:15:53,460 --> 01:15:57,143
So a fairly streamlined tempo and event presentation was necessary

680
01:15:57,203 --> 01:16:00,746
to efficiently present the Breath of the Wild's game tempo and game cycle.

681
01:16:01,467 --> 01:16:04,469
I'd like to show you the results of our being able to realize this

682
01:16:04,689 --> 01:16:06,331
as more than just a requirement.

683
01:16:11,337 --> 01:16:18,040
You're carrying an axe and see a tree you want to chop down.

684
01:16:18,841 --> 01:16:22,403
You hit the log with your axe and poof! In an instant you have bundles of firewood.

685
01:16:22,443 --> 01:16:25,964
They're even conveniently tied up with rope.

686
01:16:38,056 --> 01:16:44,537
Shoot a boar and poof! It's a haunch of raw meat.

687
01:16:45,078 --> 01:16:47,998
Birds, poof! Same story.

688
01:16:52,539 --> 01:16:56,000
You can even get acorns. Gathering foodstuffs is speedy business.

689
01:17:05,743 --> 01:17:07,203
Here's Link eating.

690
01:17:08,883 --> 01:17:23,268
This is perfect fast food, right?

691
01:17:23,768 --> 01:17:25,949
And here's Link running around with some ingredients.

692
01:17:34,585 --> 01:17:36,065
If I had to make that look realistic,

693
01:17:36,125 --> 01:17:37,346
I'm not sure what I would've done.

694
01:17:37,566 --> 01:17:39,986
That's one needle I would not have been able to thread.

695
01:17:47,189 --> 01:17:49,349
And here's Link cooking.

696
01:17:49,369 --> 01:17:55,611
Figured ingredients are tossed into the pot

697
01:17:55,731 --> 01:17:56,632
where they do a little dance

698
01:17:56,872 --> 01:17:58,272
and become something delicious.

699
01:17:59,893 --> 01:18:00,633
It's all automatic.

700
01:18:02,162 --> 01:18:05,824
Yaku, niru, itameru, sweets, subete okey.

701
01:18:06,124 --> 01:18:09,246
Roasting, boiling, sauteing, baking, it's all good.

702
01:18:15,989 --> 01:18:16,890
Bin made support.

703
01:18:17,090 --> 01:18:18,511
Even bottles are supplied.

704
01:18:23,874 --> 01:18:26,555
Kono chiisana kaito de gake kara tobioriru yuuki.

705
01:18:27,136 --> 01:18:29,817
Jumping from a cliff with just a little kite takes a lot of courage.

706
01:18:32,837 --> 01:18:35,739
In reality, you wouldn't be able to stop so quickly.

707
01:18:42,964 --> 01:18:46,027
When you come across updrafts, you're going to want to give them a try.

708
01:18:57,215 --> 01:18:59,736
You can even transition into shield surfing.

709
01:19:08,871 --> 01:19:13,436
Nice print.

710
01:19:14,176 --> 01:19:15,698
Here's Link doing some wall climbing.

711
01:19:20,943 --> 01:19:24,787
He resembles a famous American comic book hero, but Link is barehanded.

712
01:19:27,084 --> 01:19:33,148
I'll never forget how the blood drained from the faces of our terrain and players' artists' faces when they learned of this climbing feature.

713
01:19:33,168 --> 01:19:33,608
It's so cold!

714
01:19:56,433 --> 01:19:56,974
So what do you think?

715
01:20:22,245 --> 01:20:28,926
So if you imagine these actions and whatnot in the real world, what we've presented might be considered impermissibly comedic.

716
01:20:29,747 --> 01:20:35,688
When all the poofs and dancing foodstuffs were implemented, I didn't feel the absurdity of it, but rather the fun of it.

717
01:20:48,301 --> 01:20:52,885
It was the moment I felt we had come up with the answer to what this game needed in its art style.

718
01:20:55,007 --> 01:20:56,368
So this title's art style is...

719
01:21:09,555 --> 01:21:13,197
The reconciliation of the conflict between playability and reality.

720
01:21:13,557 --> 01:21:19,099
It's the result of our quest for art that makes it easy to lie to match this game known as Breath of the Wild.

721
01:21:19,119 --> 01:21:26,741
This is without a doubt the same trial and error process we've done throughout the history of the Zelda series.

722
01:21:34,876 --> 01:21:45,746
The final art style appears different from any other title, but you can say it's the constant we reached as a result of our universal thought process.

723
01:21:46,266 --> 01:21:53,252
The final art style appears different from any other title, but you can say it's the constant we reached as a result of our universal thought process.

724
01:21:54,674 --> 01:21:58,737
Now, that alone is not enough to create a stunning work of art.

725
01:22:00,532 --> 01:22:07,555
However, this alone does not get us to the creation of gutto-kuru art.

726
01:22:09,096 --> 01:22:10,417
Do you understand gutto-kuru?

727
01:22:10,437 --> 01:22:22,923
In Japan, when we remember something that stirs the soul, we use the phrase gutto-kuru to capture that feeling.

728
01:22:30,172 --> 01:22:35,696
You can't create good-looking art, or a world just with art that makes it easy to lie.

729
01:22:35,716 --> 01:22:41,421
To create an appealing, never-before-seen world filled with new surprises, you need to break conventions.

730
01:22:41,461 --> 01:22:44,403
You need to be creatively reckless.

731
01:22:45,023 --> 01:22:50,067
You can't create good-looking art, or a world just with art that makes it easy to lie.

732
01:22:50,607 --> 01:22:56,632
To create an appealing, never-before-seen world filled with new surprises, you need to break conventions.

733
01:22:57,072 --> 01:22:58,853
You need to be creatively reckless.

734
01:22:59,947 --> 01:23:05,529
And perhaps it's safe to say, in some ways, we game creators really enjoy violent work.

735
01:23:05,549 --> 01:23:06,789
In what way did our artists

736
01:23:30,028 --> 01:23:37,592
Add that guttokuru feeling to their art, they rack their brains each and every day throughout development to fully manifest their individuality. アーティストの皆さんには共感していただけると思いますが、ここが一番楽しいところだと言っても過言ではありませんよね。

737
01:23:38,913 --> 01:23:45,457
I think all the artists here today will empathize with me when I say it's not going too far to call this the most enjoyable part of the process.

738
01:23:56,514 --> 01:24:02,141
While art directors don't get to decide on functions or guidelines, when the chance arrives to choose between multiple art styles or designs,

739
01:24:13,852 --> 01:24:18,795
I have the authority to let loose the somewhat reckless triforce of the power to show to

740
01:24:18,835 --> 01:24:20,135
choose what we believe will gutto kuru, stir some souls.

741
01:24:29,791 --> 01:24:34,973
I think it's possible that at this pre-launch point in time, I'm the man who's had his soul stirred most by the art of Breath of the Wild.

742
01:24:48,290 --> 01:24:57,192
I hope from the bottom of my heart that the entire world will explore the vastness of Hyrule and have their souls stirred again and again just as I did.

743
01:24:57,692 --> 01:25:06,153
I hope from the bottom of my heart that the entire world will explore the vastness of Hyrule and have their souls stirred again and again just as I did.

744
01:25:06,173 --> 01:25:11,815
And finally, I would like to invite Mr. Fujibayashi, the Triforce of the Dragon-Spirit of Itemi.

745
01:25:12,502 --> 01:25:16,725
All right, let me turn it back over to the holder of the Triforce of the Courage to Say,

746
01:25:16,745 --> 01:25:19,147
Mr. Fujibayashi, to wrap things up.

747
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:42,643
We had the Triforce of Courage, the courage to be able to say whatever needs to be said, to bring about a new way to play a game.

748
01:26:00,170 --> 01:26:04,792
The Triforce of Wisdom, the wisdom to bring all of the game logic into reality.

749
01:26:05,773 --> 01:26:10,815
And the Triforce of Power, the power to construct a world of Zelda from all of the above.

750
01:26:30,187 --> 01:26:34,149
As you've seen in our talk today, along our path to bring this game to completion,

751
01:26:34,529 --> 01:26:36,991
the three of us, as well as the development team,

752
01:26:37,311 --> 01:26:41,594
made some significant changes to some elements, while leaving others as they are.

753
01:26:42,474 --> 01:26:46,557
I hope you were able to see that breaking conventions means to change,

754
01:26:47,197 --> 01:26:50,780
but it can also mean to not change, to keep things as they are.

755
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:55,463
Zelda was born in 2016 and has been supported by fans for 30 years.

756
01:27:00,933 --> 01:27:06,579
In 2016, Zelda celebrated its 30th anniversary with the support of all its fans.

757
01:27:18,092 --> 01:27:22,093
Breath of the Wild is a culmination of this long history of development.

758
01:27:22,773 --> 01:27:28,735
It is a new game, but at the same time re-examines the fun that lies at the essence of the franchise.

759
01:27:42,364 --> 01:27:47,288
and if this discovery is a key to future game development,

760
01:27:47,348 --> 01:27:49,289
I have no greater joy.

761
01:27:49,309 --> 01:27:51,871
Thank you for your attention today.

762
01:27:52,752 --> 01:27:54,893
If you found our discussion today interesting,

763
01:27:55,093 --> 01:27:57,075
please give Breath of the Wild a try.

764
01:27:57,095 --> 01:28:00,737
I think you'll be able to make new and interesting discoveries,

765
01:28:01,298 --> 01:28:02,899
and nothing would make us happier

766
01:28:03,279 --> 01:28:06,081
if some of these new discoveries provide you with a clue

767
01:28:06,401 --> 01:28:08,923
or inspiration for your future game development.

768
01:28:09,423 --> 01:28:11,885
Thank you very much for attending our panel today.

769
01:28:19,838 --> 01:28:20,022
Thank you.
