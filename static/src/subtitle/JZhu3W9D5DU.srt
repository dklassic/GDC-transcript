Building a gang tackle interaction for Madden Football will show our data-driven tools for

6
00:00:21,343 --> 00:00:25,745
defining interactions and their associated animations, controlling how and when the interactions

7
00:00:25,765 --> 00:00:28,866
trigger in-game, and controlling how we align the characters involved.

8
00:00:30,353 --> 00:00:33,834
We'll also discuss some details of how the system works and we'll share various features
