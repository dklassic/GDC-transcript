00:00:05,728 --> 00:00:10,510
Welcome everybody to my session called Shadow Cities and the Future of Location-Based Gaming.

2
00:00:12,532 --> 00:00:16,234
I'll start by showing some video and then get into the topic.

3
00:00:26,499 --> 00:00:31,122
Hundreds of years ago, an ancient now long forgotten force

4
00:00:32,062 --> 00:00:33,183
pulsed through our world.

5
00:00:35,715 --> 00:00:39,018
This alternative reality has now returned.

6
00:00:39,779 --> 00:00:41,660
Using technology as the gateway.

7
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,784
It will challenge you.

8
00:00:46,084 --> 00:00:48,427
It will disrupt your concept of what is real...

9
00:00:49,848 --> 00:00:50,569
...and what is not.

10
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:52,110
Join us.

11
00:00:54,712 --> 00:00:56,754
Forge alliances.

12
00:00:56,814 --> 00:00:58,196
Secure your territory.

13
00:00:58,956 --> 00:01:00,017
And fight back.

14
00:01:02,092 --> 00:01:04,193
Our battleground is where we live.

15
00:01:04,633 --> 00:01:06,893
Our streets, our cities.

16
00:01:07,973 --> 00:01:09,274
Choose a side.

17
00:01:10,314 --> 00:01:11,514
Defend your area.

18
00:01:11,914 --> 00:01:13,774
Gain control of your city.

19
00:01:14,314 --> 00:01:17,815
And expand your influence across continents.

20
00:01:19,435 --> 00:01:21,776
Shadow Cities, it's a game.

21
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:23,136
It's real.

22
00:01:26,437 --> 00:01:28,717
So this is Shadow Cities, our game.

23
00:01:31,568 --> 00:01:38,994
Let me look for this pointer and make some magic.

24
00:01:41,396 --> 00:01:42,677
My name is Markus Montola.

25
00:01:43,277 --> 00:01:46,460
I work at Gray Area, a Finnish startup

26
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,201
creating location-based games.

27
00:01:49,122 --> 00:01:51,644
I'm here to tell you about our location-based game called

28
00:01:51,684 --> 00:01:52,264
Shadow Cities.

29
00:01:52,304 --> 00:01:55,247
That was launched globally a year ago.

30
00:01:57,068 --> 00:01:58,089
Telling some of the lessons.

31
00:01:59,421 --> 00:02:02,482
and something about our vision about the future of location-based gaming.

32
00:02:05,443 --> 00:02:06,524
I work as a game designer,

33
00:02:09,485 --> 00:02:13,927
especially a lot about what's location-based in Shadowsities.

34
00:02:14,547 --> 00:02:17,348
I've been working on location-based gaming projects since 2004,

35
00:02:19,049 --> 00:02:24,291
at universities, at Nokia, and now with a commercial product at Gray Area.

36
00:02:26,263 --> 00:02:29,504
Earlier, I was here talking about our game called Pervasive

37
00:02:29,544 --> 00:02:33,546
Games, Theory and Design, that we did on the academic

38
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:37,367
background that covers some basics and principles of this

39
00:02:37,427 --> 00:02:38,048
kind of gaming.

40
00:02:38,508 --> 00:02:40,269
We were talking about that in 2009.

41
00:02:41,889 --> 00:02:44,650
Today, however, I'm taking the academic lessons on the

42
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:47,031
practical level and talking about the game we're actually

43
00:02:47,071 --> 00:02:48,732
doing and promoting here.

44
00:02:51,393 --> 00:02:53,034
Not everyone has heard about Shadows, it is.

45
00:02:53,475 --> 00:02:54,696
So a couple of words.

46
00:02:55,476 --> 00:02:58,379
A big part of why I'm here talking to you today

47
00:02:58,859 --> 00:03:02,102
is that we won an online innovation award in GDC Online

48
00:03:02,122 --> 00:03:02,522
last year.

49
00:03:03,403 --> 00:03:06,846
We've also been nominated for a couple of awards,

50
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:09,027
such as the Nordic Best Handheld Game.

51
00:03:09,628 --> 00:03:12,650
And most recently, we won an audience award

52
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:15,193
for the Best Mobile MMO on iOS.

53
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:19,096
Or as the New York Times said.

54
00:03:21,052 --> 00:03:26,333
I have played the future of mobile gaming. It's called Shadow Cities. Shadow Cities isn't

55
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:31,194
just the future of mobile gaming. It may actually be the most interesting, innovative, provocative,

56
00:03:31,494 --> 00:03:36,855
and far-reaching video game in the world right now on any system. In words of Seth Schiesel

57
00:03:36,935 --> 00:03:42,576
in their Culture front page. Hype aside, I'm going to show you a little bit about the game

58
00:03:43,176 --> 00:03:48,417
and then talk about what it's about and where we're going. So if I can get the...

59
00:03:50,026 --> 00:03:57,189
game itself on the screen. This is Shadows It Is. When you log in for the first time,

60
00:03:57,849 --> 00:04:02,831
you realize that this is where I am really. So when you look at the map, you can see that

61
00:04:02,891 --> 00:04:07,813
we're directly here in the Moscow center. I can look around in the map. I can see some

62
00:04:07,853 --> 00:04:14,676
things players have created here. For instance, here is a beacon created by a guy called Scatterbrain,

63
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,537
which I can use to navigate the place.

64
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:22,852
Or we can see some spirits, NPC monsters that we can attack if we want to.

65
00:04:23,512 --> 00:04:26,013
And other players, Scatterbrain is moving here apparently.

66
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:32,996
Some enemy players, I'm playing on the orange side as an architect.

67
00:04:33,076 --> 00:04:34,356
And here we can see an animator.

68
00:04:35,937 --> 00:04:37,878
I can move around in the world a little bit if you want to.

69
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:41,419
Jump around.

70
00:04:42,299 --> 00:04:44,480
Or I can cast spells at the enemies.

71
00:04:45,887 --> 00:04:51,631
As you can see, the whole UI is pretty abstract, a little bit sparse, but we want to create

72
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:57,675
a game where the feeling is all about you being the mage. That's why I use runes and

73
00:04:58,136 --> 00:05:03,880
magic symbols to cast spells, because we didn't want to create a game where you push buttons

74
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:08,684
to cast stuff. We want to create a game where you are the mage, where you can yourself feel

75
00:05:08,724 --> 00:05:11,005
that you're in the virtual world.

76
00:05:14,036 --> 00:05:19,284
Uh, usually when I'm demoing this live, someone's sooner or later attacking me and BiteyBat

77
00:05:19,364 --> 00:05:21,668
is now doing the task for me, so apparently I died.

78
00:05:23,491 --> 00:05:24,252
It happens every time.

79
00:05:24,693 --> 00:05:25,434
Thank you, BiteyBat.

80
00:05:27,297 --> 00:05:29,220
All right, let's get back to the business.

81
00:05:35,563 --> 00:05:38,785
So as you saw, Shadow Cities is a very PVP-oriented game.

82
00:05:39,045 --> 00:05:43,788
We have two sides fighting, the architects and the animators.

83
00:05:43,928 --> 00:05:45,509
It's all about conquering your city.

84
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:47,089
Two factions are struggling.

85
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,311
Who controls which neighborhood?

86
00:05:49,991 --> 00:05:53,573
When I come to Moscow Center, I can build dominators,

87
00:05:53,633 --> 00:05:57,475
and I can collect energy from the magical ambience

88
00:05:57,995 --> 00:05:58,836
of the area.

89
00:05:59,296 --> 00:06:01,757
And the side that gathers more points every week wins.

90
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:10,087
It's a kind of an eternal struggle that never ends or produces kind of permanent result,

91
00:06:10,888 --> 00:06:12,970
but that keeps the players occupied pretty well.

92
00:06:13,951 --> 00:06:17,775
Also we supplement that with a lot of missions and quests and that kind of stuff.

93
00:06:20,237 --> 00:06:24,462
We started originally as a three-person startup.

94
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:29,714
And of course a lot of the design we are showing today is motivated by the fact that our original

95
00:06:29,754 --> 00:06:35,521
business plan was selling one guy's car and then living off it until the things turned

96
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:35,802
better.

97
00:06:35,822 --> 00:06:41,609
And indeed they did because now we are 17 people in Helsinki and we're out in 38 countries

98
00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:42,129
and so forth.

99
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:48,741
The entire game is built at the moment on the philosophy of

100
00:06:49,521 --> 00:06:51,783
wouldn't it be cool if we did this or that?

101
00:06:52,403 --> 00:06:54,705
And wouldn't it be cool if I could control my city?

102
00:06:55,005 --> 00:06:57,187
Wouldn't it be cool if I was a mage in my city?

103
00:06:57,527 --> 00:06:59,948
Wouldn't it be cool if I could see the other guy right there

104
00:06:59,989 --> 00:07:03,571
and attack him over all these street blocks and everything?

105
00:07:07,634 --> 00:07:09,355
I think our players agree it's pretty cool.

106
00:07:10,536 --> 00:07:13,398
So Shadow Cities is a location-based MMORPG.

107
00:07:15,207 --> 00:07:19,372
The basic game mechanics are about casting spells, killing enemies, gathering XP, completing

108
00:07:19,432 --> 00:07:21,555
missions, fighting other players, so forth.

109
00:07:22,095 --> 00:07:25,019
But what makes it special is that everything is done on a map.

110
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,203
In essence, the planet is our playground.

111
00:07:30,405 --> 00:07:31,467
We try to do this planet...

112
00:07:32,608 --> 00:07:36,531
being playground on two levels. When you log in, you can see the micro level. You can see

113
00:07:36,551 --> 00:07:41,154
your own city block. You can see the Moscone Center. But of course, the battle is about

114
00:07:41,174 --> 00:07:46,617
the world. You're trying to conquer the world. You're stealing energy from the world and

115
00:07:46,837 --> 00:07:51,760
trying to win our weekly campaigns. So here on the map, you can see that different sides

116
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,601
have taken different parts of Europe over.

117
00:07:54,142 --> 00:07:57,164
and they are struggling. So whenever you play the game you can

118
00:07:57,464 --> 00:08:00,266
be a part of the big struggle. You can be one of the French

119
00:08:00,527 --> 00:08:03,969
architects or French animators and you can be one of the people who are

120
00:08:04,249 --> 00:08:08,553
really carrying this battle to our sense. We believe that this is the most exciting

121
00:08:08,573 --> 00:08:09,433
game board you can have.

122
00:08:10,994 --> 00:08:12,676
Everything that mankind has built

123
00:08:12,836 --> 00:08:15,858
is on our map basically. So there's

124
00:08:15,998 --> 00:08:19,301
there are a lot of activities players are organizing for themselves that are based

125
00:08:19,341 --> 00:08:21,983
on the fact that we have this infinite resource on our use.

126
00:08:25,006 --> 00:08:27,233
It is very powerful when you log in for the first time.

127
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:31,524
You get a very tangible and visual feeling of here and now.

128
00:08:32,005 --> 00:08:34,646
When you see that you're in your hometown,

129
00:08:34,686 --> 00:08:36,567
you can see your own home there on the map.

130
00:08:36,887 --> 00:08:39,529
You can see your neighbors a couple of blocks away.

131
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:41,310
You can see that they are playing right now.

132
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:44,351
You can start battling, shooting spells back and forth.

133
00:08:44,411 --> 00:08:46,072
You can talk to them in comms.

134
00:08:46,733 --> 00:08:51,055
It creates a very powerful first minute of absolute wow

135
00:08:51,195 --> 00:08:53,256
that we try to create and then cultivate

136
00:08:53,336 --> 00:08:55,257
over a longer player lifetime.

137
00:08:56,568 --> 00:08:59,110
Our philosophy is to make games that are much more than check-ins.

138
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:04,434
Most location-based games are very much check-in based, or they are mini-game based, while

139
00:09:04,474 --> 00:09:10,940
we are trying to make a real-time gameplay going on in the game in the fashion of real

140
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,962
MMOs like, I don't know, World of Warcraft or whatever.

141
00:09:19,036 --> 00:09:23,400
As a resource, I mentioned already, people love this emergent exploration.

142
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:27,864
We don't need to put stuff on the map for them to find it.

143
00:09:27,924 --> 00:09:30,906
For instance, here the players are in the Forbidden City in Beijing.

144
00:09:32,348 --> 00:09:33,569
They organize these treasure hunts.

145
00:09:33,609 --> 00:09:37,773
Here they are in Arc of Triumph in Paris or Pearl Harbor or Area 51.

146
00:09:40,093 --> 00:09:43,857
Players go into these places, they organize their own competitions, they organize scavenger

147
00:09:43,897 --> 00:09:44,477
hunts and whatever.

148
00:09:45,498 --> 00:09:47,621
They write fanfic based on what we do.

149
00:09:48,902 --> 00:09:52,626
They write fanfic about gathering in Area 51 and going there and doing stuff.

150
00:09:54,406 --> 00:09:58,527
The powerful resource we have here is that we have a coherent world. Everything in the

151
00:09:58,567 --> 00:10:05,488
game is supporting the same fiction because it is, this is not a game. It is your magic

152
00:10:05,548 --> 00:10:09,989
device where you draw runes and you cast spells. So everything you have in the real world you

153
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:15,010
can appropriate into the game. If you have a cool piece of local folklore you can, you

154
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:20,871
can enter it into the fiction. If, if you have a mage meet-up cruise you can make that

155
00:10:20,891 --> 00:10:21,432
a game event.

156
00:10:24,163 --> 00:10:26,803
We believe that games like Shadows at East can create a

157
00:10:26,823 --> 00:10:28,864
very powerful feeling of secret world.

158
00:10:30,484 --> 00:10:33,705
Until you see the game and open it up, you're completely

159
00:10:33,785 --> 00:10:37,205
unaware that the Moscone Center has been an area for

160
00:10:37,245 --> 00:10:38,265
fighting for this weekend.

161
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:41,746
But once you try it out, you can see that there's stuff

162
00:10:41,786 --> 00:10:43,346
going on you didn't know about.

163
00:10:43,667 --> 00:10:45,627
People are actually fighting over some

164
00:10:45,647 --> 00:10:46,367
things you don't see.

165
00:10:46,407 --> 00:10:49,928
And when you go outside, you can actually envision

166
00:10:49,968 --> 00:10:52,048
yourself seeing the beacon coming out from behind the

167
00:10:52,088 --> 00:10:52,748
buildings or whatever.

168
00:10:54,568 --> 00:11:01,814
in a very tangible way. So our vision is not to create just a game, but a kind of a global

169
00:11:01,854 --> 00:11:08,419
game layer that could extend to other media as well. When players put Shadow Cities in

170
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:13,682
their pockets and walk on the streets, it follows them wherever they go. So even when

171
00:11:13,722 --> 00:11:17,865
you don't actively play the game, you are still, in some sense, a part of the game.

172
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:21,888
If you left a beacon or a dominator or whatever in the world.

173
00:11:23,586 --> 00:11:26,426
Other players can find it, other players can attack it.

174
00:11:26,766 --> 00:11:31,307
You could get a push notification that people are right there needing your help.

175
00:11:31,767 --> 00:11:36,329
Or you could get a push notification that your things are going to be attacked, and so forth.

176
00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:39,529
Of course, we also leverage the appointment gameplay.

177
00:11:39,549 --> 00:11:43,770
So when you take over the Moscow Center, you start gathering energy points,

178
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:46,031
and you want to go there to see that they are still there.

179
00:11:47,235 --> 00:11:50,778
We're trying to make this in a way that is kind of real for

180
00:11:50,798 --> 00:11:51,399
the players.

181
00:11:52,199 --> 00:11:56,042
Instead of creating artificial structures, we're trying to

182
00:11:56,062 --> 00:11:58,224
leverage the fact that we have a living world, living

183
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,726
current world with a lot of stuff in there in order to

184
00:12:00,766 --> 00:12:04,208
motivate players to come back and check back in whenever

185
00:12:04,268 --> 00:12:06,490
they are taking a walk or walking their dog.

186
00:12:07,591 --> 00:12:09,512
So when you're doing groceries, you're in

187
00:12:09,553 --> 00:12:10,153
Shadowsities.

188
00:12:10,753 --> 00:12:12,855
Or where you're listening a lecture, you're in

189
00:12:12,895 --> 00:12:13,395
Shadowsities.

190
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:15,617
Because you can be a mage in this game.

191
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:22,049
This is one of the fan fiction things we've gotten.

192
00:12:22,069 --> 00:12:25,031
We've got a My Little Pony with architect symbols all over it.

193
00:12:27,253 --> 00:12:30,856
So let's look at what we have learned creating Shadow Cities.

194
00:12:32,998 --> 00:12:33,939
It's been quite a ride.

195
00:12:34,359 --> 00:12:36,821
We haven't taken the easiest possible route.

196
00:12:37,562 --> 00:12:41,565
In fact, we have been creating a game that is very much

197
00:12:41,645 --> 00:12:42,626
unlike anything before.

198
00:12:43,067 --> 00:12:45,088
So there have been a couple of rocks on the road.

199
00:12:45,646 --> 00:12:49,747
and we want to tell about them to you so you can avoid them when you're doing your game.

200
00:12:52,127 --> 00:12:59,049
This is my first very important point. When you think about location-based game, you think

201
00:12:59,109 --> 00:13:04,790
about players like the character in the picture, active young people who are urban explorers

202
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:10,232
or whatever, moving around in their city, biking or hiking or something. But what really

203
00:13:10,272 --> 00:13:12,872
happens is that players play on their sofa.

204
00:13:14,979 --> 00:13:17,942
The location that is most central to our game is your home.

205
00:13:19,483 --> 00:13:21,145
This is my first key takeaway.

206
00:13:21,465 --> 00:13:25,028
If you take nothing away from this lecture except for this

207
00:13:25,148 --> 00:13:27,510
one, then take this one.

208
00:13:29,472 --> 00:13:34,577
So here we can see the Pac-Man of where our players play.

209
00:13:35,558 --> 00:13:38,841
Home and work and home alone are 74% of our game play.

210
00:13:42,518 --> 00:13:46,964
while people who play on the move or somewhere else are about 26%.

211
00:13:50,689 --> 00:13:53,713
We were quite surprised to learn this when we launched the game, of course,

212
00:13:54,173 --> 00:13:59,140
because we, like everyone else, we were thinking in terms of this image that people would be moving.

213
00:14:00,332 --> 00:14:03,634
But the truth is that when you create a good game, people want

214
00:14:03,654 --> 00:14:05,135
to play it several hours a day.

215
00:14:05,796 --> 00:14:09,819
And when you ask yourself, how many hours are you in a bus or

216
00:14:10,179 --> 00:14:12,961
in other mass transit where you can play every day, that's

217
00:14:12,981 --> 00:14:15,903
going to be maximum of like one hour or less.

218
00:14:17,284 --> 00:14:20,307
So most people spend most of their online time at

219
00:14:20,387 --> 00:14:21,207
home or at work.

220
00:14:22,308 --> 00:14:28,053
And even those players who mostly play in the transit

221
00:14:28,273 --> 00:14:29,213
also play in their home.

222
00:14:32,115 --> 00:14:34,576
Players sometimes do move in order to play.

223
00:14:34,616 --> 00:14:37,077
They take out the dogs in order to attack the enemy.

224
00:14:37,557 --> 00:14:42,080
They drive around Helsinki, and they stop in weird places

225
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,520
to find if there's anything to discover.

226
00:14:44,661 --> 00:14:46,622
But for the 99% of the play time,

227
00:14:46,782 --> 00:14:47,743
it's going to be on the sofa.

228
00:14:48,283 --> 00:14:51,484
Everything that's, and a lot of things

229
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:52,705
that I'm going to talk about today

230
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:54,426
have to do with this fact.

231
00:14:56,590 --> 00:15:04,391
First of the obvious consequences of playing on your sofa is that you play with your neighbors a lot.

232
00:15:05,251 --> 00:15:08,252
You live in somewhere, you live next to the Moscow Center or whatever,

233
00:15:09,132 --> 00:15:11,312
you see the same faces every now and then.

234
00:15:11,913 --> 00:15:16,794
You see the people who are on your side, they are your instant friends,

235
00:15:16,894 --> 00:15:19,854
they are the people who protect your assets while you're away.

236
00:15:21,094 --> 00:15:23,115
They are the people who you chat with quite a bit.

237
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:26,055
They are the people who collect the points for the same team as you.

238
00:15:27,103 --> 00:15:29,564
But you also see the enemies in the same area.

239
00:15:30,024 --> 00:15:32,326
You see the nasty animator who is always

240
00:15:32,366 --> 00:15:34,527
taking down your stuff.

241
00:15:34,847 --> 00:15:38,349
Pretty quickly, there's going to be a kind of structure of

242
00:15:38,429 --> 00:15:42,010
vengeance and rivalry, neighborhood rivalry, where

243
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:44,772
you're attacking each other just because you know that he's

244
00:15:44,792 --> 00:15:46,673
going to do the same to you when he's getting out of line.

245
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,675
In some point, you might forge an alliance, some kind of a

246
00:15:50,735 --> 00:15:53,556
truce that, because we live in the same block, let's not fight

247
00:15:53,576 --> 00:15:53,937
each other.

248
00:15:57,404 --> 00:15:59,645
The problem, of course, is that the real world is not fair.

249
00:16:02,846 --> 00:16:04,547
Since we only have this one huge level,

250
00:16:05,347 --> 00:16:08,589
we can't really design it in the way we might want to.

251
00:16:09,449 --> 00:16:11,310
For instance, if in your neighborhood

252
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:14,932
there's a level 18 bully who keeps on griefing you

253
00:16:14,972 --> 00:16:17,733
whenever you get online, that's going

254
00:16:17,753 --> 00:16:18,953
to be a problem for you, of course.

255
00:16:20,127 --> 00:16:23,129
Of course, we can do stuff like protecting newbies and that kind of things.

256
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:28,013
But in fact, the real world is not fair in so many ways

257
00:16:28,953 --> 00:16:32,536
that you can never turn it into an entirely fair experience.

258
00:16:33,256 --> 00:16:35,598
For instance, if you have any resources in the game world,

259
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:38,980
if you have herbs or if you have oil or whatever,

260
00:16:39,281 --> 00:16:41,742
some people are going to live next to the resources

261
00:16:41,802 --> 00:16:43,704
while other people are going to live far from them.

262
00:16:44,264 --> 00:16:46,926
And there is no way you can balance your resources in the world

263
00:16:46,966 --> 00:16:48,547
so that they would be fair to everyone.

264
00:16:49,682 --> 00:16:52,664
One thing we were thinking, putting some stuff in downtown

265
00:16:52,904 --> 00:16:56,627
while leaving suburbs and countryside empty in order

266
00:16:56,667 --> 00:16:59,349
to create a kind of friction between the countryside players

267
00:16:59,409 --> 00:17:00,290
and the downtown players.

268
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,111
But then we ended up in a situation

269
00:17:02,151 --> 00:17:05,273
where people, of course, travel from countryside to city

270
00:17:05,313 --> 00:17:07,075
to work and back again.

271
00:17:07,435 --> 00:17:10,097
So the patterns people have in using the real world

272
00:17:10,177 --> 00:17:13,059
are so different that it's absolutely impossible to make

273
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:14,460
the real world entirely fair.

274
00:17:17,887 --> 00:17:20,871
Of course, you can take your resources and put them everywhere in the world.

275
00:17:21,311 --> 00:17:23,474
So you can have oil and herbs everywhere,

276
00:17:24,134 --> 00:17:28,279
but then you again lose some of your location-based flavor of the game.

277
00:17:29,421 --> 00:17:32,344
It's a very difficult balance to strike, entirely possible,

278
00:17:33,425 --> 00:17:36,128
but something you want to think on when you're planning your game.

279
00:17:37,712 --> 00:17:40,895
Also, you don't have lobby areas and so forth.

280
00:17:41,696 --> 00:17:44,178
In Shadow Cities, we ended up having very few resources

281
00:17:44,238 --> 00:17:44,858
in the game world.

282
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:47,400
But then again, it being a PvP game,

283
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,283
having other players near you is also a resource,

284
00:17:50,323 --> 00:17:51,384
because then you can fight them.

285
00:17:52,144 --> 00:17:53,445
And again, the game is not fair.

286
00:17:55,787 --> 00:17:57,228
That is my key takeaway number two.

287
00:18:02,325 --> 00:18:05,267
Here in the image you can see the map of southern Finland.

288
00:18:05,887 --> 00:18:08,788
It's about roughly the size of Arizona in terms

289
00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:10,929
of area and population.

290
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,371
In south you can see the big cities, Helsinki especially,

291
00:18:14,651 --> 00:18:15,091
in the middle.

292
00:18:15,971 --> 00:18:17,612
And also in the southwest you can

293
00:18:17,632 --> 00:18:18,693
see some other bigger cities.

294
00:18:19,913 --> 00:18:24,575
This map indicates the level of player activity

295
00:18:24,595 --> 00:18:25,896
in different areas in the country.

296
00:18:28,337 --> 00:18:31,799
The problem is, of course, you want to keep the countryside

297
00:18:31,859 --> 00:18:35,740
populated, but you don't want to clutter the big cities.

298
00:18:36,921 --> 00:18:40,002
You're going to have a lot of players in urban areas like

299
00:18:40,062 --> 00:18:42,483
Manhattan, so they must be playable for your game.

300
00:18:43,223 --> 00:18:45,304
But then you're going to have trouble in Montana, because

301
00:18:45,344 --> 00:18:48,085
there is no one around, there are no resources around, and

302
00:18:48,105 --> 00:18:49,426
you have to figure this out somehow.

303
00:18:52,787 --> 00:18:54,348
This is a very critical question.

304
00:18:55,728 --> 00:18:57,649
We knew that the critical mass would be some kind of an

305
00:18:57,709 --> 00:18:57,949
issue.

306
00:18:58,894 --> 00:19:00,896
But when you start delving deeper into it,

307
00:19:01,116 --> 00:19:02,778
you have to realize that you have to have,

308
00:19:03,138 --> 00:19:05,921
in a multiplayer game, you have to have the critical mass

309
00:19:06,242 --> 00:19:08,024
in every neighborhood at all times.

310
00:19:08,965 --> 00:19:10,086
Especially because Shadows of Death

311
00:19:10,106 --> 00:19:12,168
is very much about PvP and collaboration.

312
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:16,533
The experience suffers a lot if you're alone in somewhere.

313
00:19:17,154 --> 00:19:19,977
So basically, it's a very hard balance.

314
00:19:20,855 --> 00:19:25,639
When we wrote the book I mentioned, Pervasive Games, we wrote about critical mass for two

315
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:30,243
pages. If I wrote the same book today, I would write about it for, you know, 12 pages or

316
00:19:30,283 --> 00:19:39,610
something. This is probably the biggest challenge in the way of map-based games like Shadows

317
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:39,830
it is.

318
00:19:42,779 --> 00:19:46,102
I believe you have to choose to cater to downtown, to suburbs,

319
00:19:46,342 --> 00:19:50,325
or to countryside, and find some fixes for the way

320
00:19:50,365 --> 00:19:52,506
to make the game work in other areas.

321
00:19:53,907 --> 00:19:55,168
But it's not going to be easy anyway.

322
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,671
This is a very important takeaway.

323
00:20:02,093 --> 00:20:04,975
One way we can solve this problem is virtual movement.

324
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:06,877
So in Shadow Cities, as I showed you,

325
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:10,379
you can move on the map even though you don't walk around

326
00:20:10,719 --> 00:20:11,800
in the real meat space.

327
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,779
That can solve a lot of your problems.

328
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,059
You can create newbie areas.

329
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,361
You can solve the critical mass issue.

330
00:20:20,202 --> 00:20:23,444
It also will shift your balance from playing with neighbors

331
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,285
to playing with your real world friends.

332
00:20:25,785 --> 00:20:28,867
If you want to have a game where my Facebook friends are

333
00:20:28,907 --> 00:20:31,828
more important than my friends in shadow cities,

334
00:20:32,109 --> 00:20:33,189
this might be a thing to do.

335
00:20:33,249 --> 00:20:35,150
Because then, if you live in Manhattan,

336
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:39,233
I can maybe travel to Manhattan and play with you.

337
00:20:40,381 --> 00:20:42,222
But of course, this is also, I would say, a trade-off.

338
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,344
If you're creating a location-based game

339
00:20:44,384 --> 00:20:46,085
and if you're serious about it, you

340
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:47,486
might want to think about how much

341
00:20:47,607 --> 00:20:49,468
of your location-based appeal you

342
00:20:49,488 --> 00:20:51,269
will lose by going this way.

343
00:20:54,632 --> 00:20:56,874
Probably the right thing to do is some kind of a balance.

344
00:20:57,674 --> 00:21:00,036
Shadow Cities has one example of the balance,

345
00:21:00,356 --> 00:21:02,858
and we've been tweaking it while the game has been running.

346
00:21:03,719 --> 00:21:05,720
But I'm really much looking forward

347
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:09,603
to finding out what kind of solutions are found in future.

348
00:21:11,915 --> 00:21:16,696
In Shadows, it is the primary way for players to move is the beacons. I can place a beacon

349
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:21,978
in Moscow Center and all my friends can then immediately warp to Moscow Center. We have

350
00:21:21,998 --> 00:21:27,059
a lot of good player activity when there is a fight going on in somewhere like Central

351
00:21:27,099 --> 00:21:31,121
Park, New York, and people start putting up beacons and screaming to their friends that

352
00:21:31,281 --> 00:21:37,122
please come help me because these guys are running us over. And that creates a lot of

353
00:21:37,182 --> 00:21:40,363
good big battles bringing people together in urban areas.

354
00:21:43,149 --> 00:21:47,813
Another solution we have used is that we encourage dormant

355
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:48,374
gameplay.

356
00:21:50,135 --> 00:21:52,918
With dormant gameplay, I mean that the game is dormant.

357
00:21:53,419 --> 00:21:56,161
You're not actively playing, but there's still things happening

358
00:21:56,201 --> 00:21:57,342
that can influence your assets.

359
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,666
And the game can also alarm you from the dormancy

360
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:02,828
with a push notification or some other message

361
00:22:03,328 --> 00:22:05,470
and invite you to play again.

362
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:13,762
That is a good method because even if you don't have the temporal aspect of the critical

363
00:22:13,802 --> 00:22:20,207
mass in order, you can have other players leaving their marks in the world and when

364
00:22:20,587 --> 00:22:25,531
the players are finding each other's marks, they start alarming and inviting each other

365
00:22:25,651 --> 00:22:28,192
over to the game and that works pretty well for us.

366
00:22:29,954 --> 00:22:33,156
On the other hand, our mechanics encourage ambient gameplay.

367
00:22:33,983 --> 00:22:38,845
With ambient gameplay I mean gameplay where I'm working and I have my cell phone on and

368
00:22:38,945 --> 00:22:43,807
I'm monitoring what's happening around, say, Moscow center. I'm watching over my assets

369
00:22:43,847 --> 00:22:48,689
and I'm chatting with my friends and I'm working, I'm, you know, whatever, sitting in Facebook

370
00:22:48,729 --> 00:22:49,089
or something.

371
00:22:50,487 --> 00:22:54,810
We actually have sessions that are upwards of 60 minutes long.

372
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:57,812
People just getting online, sitting on their dominators,

373
00:22:57,852 --> 00:23:00,273
sitting on their gateways, looking

374
00:23:00,313 --> 00:23:03,215
at their neighborhoods, and chatting and fighting

375
00:23:03,455 --> 00:23:03,995
every now and then.

376
00:23:05,556 --> 00:23:07,377
It's a very hardcore group that does that.

377
00:23:07,797 --> 00:23:11,580
But then again, we are aiming at our game

378
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,760
to the gamer audience anyway.

379
00:23:14,878 --> 00:23:21,264
It is often thought that real-time gaming requires long play sessions, but for Shadow Cities this is clearly not true.

380
00:23:21,965 --> 00:23:28,010
If I log in just for a couple of minutes like I did a moment ago, there will be someone quite often I can fight with,

381
00:23:28,551 --> 00:23:33,135
or I can harvest my stuff, or I can plant some stuff for harvesting in future.

382
00:23:34,075 --> 00:23:36,936
And there's a good chance of real-time gameplay coming in,

383
00:23:37,396 --> 00:23:37,797
meeting me.

384
00:23:38,437 --> 00:23:40,417
Especially when the game gives me a push notification

385
00:23:40,437 --> 00:23:41,538
that my stuff is under attack,

386
00:23:41,918 --> 00:23:43,538
I just check into the push notification

387
00:23:43,598 --> 00:23:46,319
and I'm in the fight right away, in the middle of it.

388
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,741
In this image, we are in Beirut.

389
00:23:54,421 --> 00:23:57,302
And Beirut is here to illustrate the challenges of location data.

390
00:23:58,702 --> 00:24:02,783
For instance, in here, our map data was all encoded in Arabic.

391
00:24:04,265 --> 00:24:06,026
There are a lot of these kind of surprises

392
00:24:06,427 --> 00:24:08,429
that you will encounter once you're

393
00:24:08,469 --> 00:24:10,711
starting to roll your game out in different countries.

394
00:24:12,873 --> 00:24:16,035
Some places are not in the map databases at all.

395
00:24:16,756 --> 00:24:19,298
Our central unit of map data is neighborhood.

396
00:24:19,719 --> 00:24:21,320
And neighborhood means very different things

397
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,141
in different places.

398
00:24:25,655 --> 00:24:29,418
We've been looking also a lot into stuff like venue data

399
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:31,380
from Goala and Foursquare.

400
00:24:32,001 --> 00:24:33,982
But that data is also quite problematic.

401
00:24:34,383 --> 00:24:37,906
For instance, we were looking at military installations,

402
00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:40,609
and we found a load of historical sites.

403
00:24:41,449 --> 00:24:44,752
And if I find a historical castle when I'm trying to find

404
00:24:44,772 --> 00:24:49,196
an ammo depot, for me as a player, it creates a bad sense

405
00:24:49,297 --> 00:24:51,458
of discontinuity between the game and the real world.

406
00:24:52,339 --> 00:24:55,821
We want to create a feeling where the player knows that

407
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:57,242
there's a military installation here,

408
00:24:57,302 --> 00:24:58,803
and so when I go there,

409
00:24:58,843 --> 00:25:01,064
there might be something related to military installations.

410
00:25:01,784 --> 00:25:03,345
But when you use map data,

411
00:25:03,625 --> 00:25:05,786
you might very likely end up in tinkering

412
00:25:06,307 --> 00:25:07,247
with the data yourself.

413
00:25:07,747 --> 00:25:08,908
And that's, of course, a lot of work,

414
00:25:08,948 --> 00:25:10,269
because the only level you can have,

415
00:25:10,429 --> 00:25:12,890
which is the planet, is really, really big level.

416
00:25:15,812 --> 00:25:17,813
Of course, you can let your players edit your database.

417
00:25:19,311 --> 00:25:23,655
But you should then remember that players who are playing on their sofa will want to

418
00:25:23,735 --> 00:25:27,479
optimize their own neighborhood. So they want to put their military installation

419
00:25:27,499 --> 00:25:29,441
in a hospital and whatever you give resources for.

420
00:25:29,701 --> 00:25:36,127
So it's not going to be easy that way either. This is again a key takeaway that you want

421
00:25:36,147 --> 00:25:43,895
to take on the production side, definitely. Speaking of maps, this is what maps look like.

422
00:25:45,049 --> 00:25:46,970
And when you look at the location-based games that use

423
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:51,013
maps, you can frequently see that they don't look very game

424
00:25:51,073 --> 00:25:51,293
like.

425
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:52,494
They don't look very playful.

426
00:25:53,155 --> 00:25:54,236
They don't look very fun.

427
00:25:55,396 --> 00:25:59,139
And that is, of course, because our mission with the maps is

428
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,922
actually the opposite when we compare it with the mission of

429
00:26:02,942 --> 00:26:04,423
the people who are actually making the maps.

430
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:10,502
They want to make clear, concise visualizations of environment.

431
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:14,584
They want them to be zoomable and pannable and so forth.

432
00:26:15,045 --> 00:26:19,167
They want them to be neutral, unoffending, serious, clean,

433
00:26:19,807 --> 00:26:20,047
clear.

434
00:26:21,417 --> 00:26:25,082
While, for instance, when you look at the Shadows of the East map that is blue and black

435
00:26:25,563 --> 00:26:31,110
and creates a fictional world, we're somewhere closer to what people want to do in level design

436
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:38,399
in console games. We want it to be mysterious and secretive and shady and intriguing.

437
00:26:41,296 --> 00:26:45,999
In my opinion, when you see people putting game-like frames

438
00:26:46,099 --> 00:26:48,741
or game-like icons on top of the Google Maps or Bing Maps

439
00:26:48,781 --> 00:26:52,724
or whatever, it very rarely works nicely because

440
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:54,185
of this inherent contradiction.

441
00:26:54,826 --> 00:26:56,927
Also, the map data is full of details

442
00:26:56,947 --> 00:26:58,788
you don't want to maybe tell your players.

443
00:26:59,249 --> 00:27:04,412
For instance, here we can see Marriott Hotel and Moscone

444
00:27:04,452 --> 00:27:05,533
Center and so forth.

445
00:27:06,234 --> 00:27:11,516
And it might be that if your game is about mages,

446
00:27:11,536 --> 00:27:13,456
you don't want your mages to focus on hotels

447
00:27:13,996 --> 00:27:16,017
and tourist attractions.

448
00:27:16,057 --> 00:27:18,598
You might want to have, you know, dark alleys

449
00:27:18,758 --> 00:27:20,499
and whatever on your map.

450
00:27:25,501 --> 00:27:26,221
Technologically...

451
00:27:27,969 --> 00:27:31,231
Of course, iPhone was a great news for our company, actually.

452
00:27:31,351 --> 00:27:34,472
We wouldn't exist without iPhone.

453
00:27:35,693 --> 00:27:39,075
But still, the tech that we are using in the games,

454
00:27:39,635 --> 00:27:42,056
it's not exactly designed for location-based gaming,

455
00:27:42,516 --> 00:27:45,398
and it's also not necessarily very optimal for it.

456
00:27:47,059 --> 00:27:48,660
For instance, if you take positioning,

457
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,701
positioning is not very accurate,

458
00:27:50,781 --> 00:27:51,861
and it takes a lot of battery.

459
00:27:52,984 --> 00:27:56,025
Of course, most of the time when utility apps position you,

460
00:27:56,366 --> 00:27:59,447
they just want your location once.

461
00:28:00,027 --> 00:28:03,229
Or if you have a running app, then maybe like once a minute

462
00:28:03,289 --> 00:28:03,689
or something.

463
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:06,010
But if you're biking away from the architects,

464
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:08,591
should we update your location all the time?

465
00:28:10,612 --> 00:28:12,212
The problem is that positioning takes time.

466
00:28:12,432 --> 00:28:13,253
It's not very fast.

467
00:28:13,773 --> 00:28:15,914
It devours battery power, especially

468
00:28:15,954 --> 00:28:19,055
in iPhone 3GS playing Shadows of the East.

469
00:28:19,135 --> 00:28:20,896
It's quite a challenge because you

470
00:28:20,916 --> 00:28:21,877
have to be hooked into that.

471
00:28:22,313 --> 00:28:26,096
into the charger pretty much, and so forth.

472
00:28:26,857 --> 00:28:29,699
And the challenge here is that when

473
00:28:29,719 --> 00:28:31,381
you're in an environment like App Store,

474
00:28:31,401 --> 00:28:33,683
you're going to get reviews from all your players,

475
00:28:34,043 --> 00:28:35,985
not only the players who you optimize for.

476
00:28:36,625 --> 00:28:40,088
So if you have issues with battery life

477
00:28:40,309 --> 00:28:42,110
and you have your game open for 3GS,

478
00:28:42,491 --> 00:28:43,932
you're going to have lots of people

479
00:28:43,952 --> 00:28:47,635
there giving you low ratings because they're not satisfied

480
00:28:47,655 --> 00:28:48,556
with the battery performance.

481
00:28:50,765 --> 00:28:53,327
The same applies to positioning accuracy, of course.

482
00:28:54,648 --> 00:28:57,870
The positioning on iPhone is mostly reliable,

483
00:28:58,691 --> 00:29:00,512
but when it's not and it often is not,

484
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:02,914
then you start getting complaints from players

485
00:29:03,334 --> 00:29:06,076
as if you could do something about it, which of course you

486
00:29:06,096 --> 00:29:06,296
can't.

487
00:29:09,478 --> 00:29:11,200
We also need a lot of network traffic.

488
00:29:13,801 --> 00:29:17,484
And the thing about mobile lag is that it's very spiky.

489
00:29:19,273 --> 00:29:23,075
The network lag can spike unpredictably above three to five seconds.

490
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:26,736
If we get a ten second lag spike, it's not a rare occasion.

491
00:29:27,816 --> 00:29:31,018
It's particularly difficult because it's very, very hard to predict.

492
00:29:31,458 --> 00:29:36,299
If you have an iPhone, you know, of course, just holding it the wrong way might spike

493
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:38,880
your lag and your players will be wondering what's happening.

494
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,522
Your player might be going inside an elevator or a car

495
00:29:43,202 --> 00:29:47,766
and still not realize that it's he who is creating the lag,

496
00:29:47,826 --> 00:29:49,607
not your system or even the phone.

497
00:29:50,568 --> 00:29:52,369
And of course, when you're running a multiplayer game,

498
00:29:52,629 --> 00:29:55,311
you don't know, or your designers can't predict

499
00:29:55,511 --> 00:29:58,193
who is going to be on GPRS, who is going to be on Wi-Fi,

500
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,654
who is going to be on Edge or 3G.

501
00:30:00,654 --> 00:30:03,756
And in multiplayer battles, of course, the people in Wi-Fi

502
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:05,638
have an edge, so to say.

503
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:11,946
The way we manage these problems is that we try to manage the

504
00:30:11,986 --> 00:30:16,549
players' expectations from the start. For instance, if we

505
00:30:16,609 --> 00:30:20,071
gave, if we pinpointed the players' location on the map

506
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:23,993
very exactly, we'd get even more complaints about the problems

507
00:30:24,013 --> 00:30:27,434
of positioning. Instead in Shadow Cities, we hover the

508
00:30:27,475 --> 00:30:31,497
players gently above the map so that the players are somewhat

509
00:30:31,577 --> 00:30:33,678
unable to say where there's going to be problems.

510
00:30:34,924 --> 00:30:38,726
With lag spikes, we of course cover lag spikes in casting animations.

511
00:30:39,826 --> 00:30:43,728
Most of our spells can be only, they take like two or three seconds to cast,

512
00:30:44,128 --> 00:30:47,269
so our battles are a couple of spells back and forth instead of

513
00:30:47,609 --> 00:30:50,730
what we might otherwise do, a dozen of spells back and forth.

514
00:30:54,272 --> 00:30:57,913
If you create quick interactions and quick animations, you're going to be in trouble.

515
00:30:59,367 --> 00:31:02,489
In some point, we were thinking about a game idea

516
00:31:02,749 --> 00:31:05,590
with swords and attacks and ninjas and stuff,

517
00:31:06,311 --> 00:31:07,291
hitting back and forth.

518
00:31:07,791 --> 00:31:09,612
But in a ninja animation, it's going

519
00:31:09,632 --> 00:31:12,594
to be super difficult to hide the fact that you're hitting

520
00:31:12,654 --> 00:31:16,535
someone with a sword, and then the lag is five seconds.

521
00:31:22,138 --> 00:31:23,959
The thematic limitations in this field are.

522
00:31:24,631 --> 00:31:28,879
going to be a challenge. They are not a huge challenge yet because everything is not yet

523
00:31:28,979 --> 00:31:33,427
done, but they will be a huge challenge in five years. If you want to create a game like

524
00:31:33,467 --> 00:31:36,873
Shadows it is where the integration of real world and game world.

525
00:31:37,816 --> 00:31:41,058
are as, is as thorough as we are aiming for.

526
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:44,340
You have very few themes that you can viably exploit.

527
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:48,783
You have vampires, mafia, paranormal, aliens, police,

528
00:31:49,304 --> 00:31:49,964
and so forth.

529
00:31:50,664 --> 00:31:52,906
But there's gonna be the day when all this real world

530
00:31:52,966 --> 00:31:55,868
fiction is so strongly tapped out

531
00:31:56,148 --> 00:31:58,650
that it's gonna be pretty hard to come up with new fiction.

532
00:32:02,326 --> 00:32:06,330
And I think for vampires we are seeing that already in the

533
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:07,451
culture in general.

534
00:32:07,691 --> 00:32:09,973
That people have seen so many vampires that they don't want

535
00:32:09,993 --> 00:32:11,074
to see any more vampires.

536
00:32:11,955 --> 00:32:16,019
And I wouldn't be surprised if mafia or crime or that kind of

537
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:18,381
stuff would be going pretty fast after it.

538
00:32:21,124 --> 00:32:23,907
This is actually, this is a real challenge because

539
00:32:24,972 --> 00:32:29,394
The experience of Shadow Cities is that the cohesive world and the total team that is

540
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:34,476
overarching is very powerful in terms of player creation, in terms of fan fiction, in terms

541
00:32:34,516 --> 00:32:40,818
of player-created activities. It is very valuable for us that the mythology of Shadow Cities,

542
00:32:41,198 --> 00:32:47,041
even though it's very sparse, it's consistent and players have easy time adding to it. So

543
00:32:49,161 --> 00:32:50,982
you might want to plunder it before it's all gone.

544
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,802
The important thing about many of these challenges

545
00:32:57,003 --> 00:32:59,105
is that some of them are unsolvable.

546
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:01,989
This is something game designers rarely say,

547
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:05,754
but I feel that we need to understand it

548
00:33:05,974 --> 00:33:06,715
in terms of design.

549
00:33:07,536 --> 00:33:10,620
If we take an example from the MMO, RPG,

550
00:33:11,681 --> 00:33:17,644
or mud scene. They had a couple of problems that they discovered were unsolvable, but

551
00:33:17,684 --> 00:33:22,326
it took them years and years to discover it. Permadeath is probably the most famous example.

552
00:33:22,946 --> 00:33:28,509
They tried to make Permadeath in lots of multi-user dungeons. They tried to make it in different

553
00:33:28,569 --> 00:33:36,073
kinds of Permadeath in many MMORPGs. Even Star Wars Galaxies had a Permadeath in the

554
00:33:36,113 --> 00:33:39,454
beginning for Jedi characters. They discovered that

555
00:33:40,491 --> 00:33:46,074
As long as you have unreliable network connections, people are going to lose connection and they

556
00:33:46,134 --> 00:33:49,375
are going to die. And that is not fun if you have permadeath.

557
00:33:51,296 --> 00:33:57,559
Or if you don't, if you allow people to unplug their computers when they are about to die,

558
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:00,281
then they will do so to avoid permadeath all the time.

559
00:34:01,421 --> 00:34:04,163
So permadeath turned out to be an unsolvable problem.

560
00:34:05,926 --> 00:34:09,368
The way they deal with the permadeath now is, of course,

561
00:34:09,648 --> 00:34:11,609
that when you die in World of Warcraft,

562
00:34:11,629 --> 00:34:13,910
you spawn a minute later next to where you died.

563
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:18,472
This was kind of an unthinkable and unintuitive solution

564
00:34:18,692 --> 00:34:20,893
when first mods came out.

565
00:34:20,953 --> 00:34:23,414
Because if you have a world and someone dies in the world,

566
00:34:23,594 --> 00:34:24,975
then they have to stay dead.

567
00:34:25,295 --> 00:34:26,395
Otherwise, there is no point.

568
00:34:29,477 --> 00:34:31,958
I'm wondering what are the unsolvable problems

569
00:34:32,538 --> 00:34:35,360
of the map-based games and location-based games.

570
00:34:36,212 --> 00:34:39,855
We don't know it yet because we're going to try different approaches a couple of times.

571
00:34:40,456 --> 00:34:44,239
We're trying to find our ways around them. We're looking for the solutions.

572
00:34:44,819 --> 00:34:49,283
And I'm looking forward to see which of these problems can be solved. For instance,

573
00:34:49,783 --> 00:34:54,227
is the critical mass an unsolvable problem or do we find a clever way around it?

574
00:34:54,947 --> 00:34:58,610
In MMORPG scene, one of the issues with critical mass they used

575
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:03,334
to avoid cluttering was instancing. Maybe we should try instancing as well.

576
00:35:05,825 --> 00:35:10,229
Of course, over time we're coming up with unintuitive solutions that become the staple

577
00:35:10,269 --> 00:35:16,415
of the industry, like spawning next to a dead body. My favorite example is farm bill gifts,

578
00:35:17,496 --> 00:35:20,979
the presents you give to other players that you can't get yourself, that you don't lose

579
00:35:20,999 --> 00:35:25,283
when you give them out. That seems nowadays quite intuitive to the players, even though

580
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:27,585
they wouldn't make any sense in any other context.

581
00:35:29,542 --> 00:35:30,923
This is my fifth key takeaway.

582
00:35:31,384 --> 00:35:32,786
When you're trying to solve these problems,

583
00:35:33,667 --> 00:35:35,990
you should think about whether they are unsolvable,

584
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:37,292
and you should just go around them.

585
00:35:39,134 --> 00:35:41,016
As a company, what we're going to do

586
00:35:41,096 --> 00:35:43,159
is going to the future step by step.

587
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:44,861
With Shadows, it is.

588
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:53,463
we absolutely innovated. We tried to create 80% new things and stick to 20% old things.

589
00:35:53,924 --> 00:35:58,225
But in future, I believe that now that we've established and we learned from Shadow Cities,

590
00:35:58,526 --> 00:36:02,467
we're going to try to stick 80% to what we know and just innovate for the 20%.

591
00:36:04,108 --> 00:36:10,891
Instead of jumping into unknown, the business model should be careful exploration of what works and how to innovate on top of that.

592
00:36:12,363 --> 00:36:15,626
Of course, the games like these must be extremely simple.

593
00:36:16,126 --> 00:36:17,748
Shadowsadists is quite complicated, actually,

594
00:36:18,649 --> 00:36:22,012
because the players still have a hard time in understanding

595
00:36:22,072 --> 00:36:24,534
how to play location-based games in the first place.

596
00:36:28,778 --> 00:36:30,560
Even though our game is fairly abstract,

597
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,862
we get these player creations.

598
00:36:33,843 --> 00:36:36,585
One of our players is creating plush toys out of the spirits

599
00:36:36,745 --> 00:36:37,546
and sent us some.

600
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:44,151
So the challenges we have chosen to address,

601
00:36:44,552 --> 00:36:45,912
they are far from easy.

602
00:36:46,533 --> 00:36:49,694
But we believe that there is a future

603
00:36:49,714 --> 00:36:50,895
in location-based games.

604
00:36:51,335 --> 00:36:53,896
And we want to be one of the first companies that

605
00:36:53,956 --> 00:36:57,038
go there and figure out what is this new thing.

606
00:36:58,419 --> 00:36:59,859
We're building our playbook and trying

607
00:36:59,879 --> 00:37:01,440
to learn from the lessons of Shadows,

608
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:06,363
it is from the ups and downs and kind of loading

609
00:37:06,403 --> 00:37:07,563
our gun for the next big shot.

610
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:14,644
We believe that in location-based gaming, the sweet spot in terms of business is right now.

611
00:37:15,305 --> 00:37:20,529
There is not yet a category leader like Zynga or Blizzard, but the tech is sufficiently advanced

612
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:24,893
and the business models, monetization and viral models are sufficiently

613
00:37:25,194 --> 00:37:27,436
advanced that we can create a viable product.

614
00:37:28,061 --> 00:37:31,722
And indeed, Shadow Cities came out a year ago, and after

615
00:37:31,962 --> 00:37:35,103
Shadow Cities, there have been at least the following games.

616
00:37:35,464 --> 00:37:39,565
Stinktopia, Go War, Zombihood, Life is Crime, Please Stay

617
00:37:39,605 --> 00:37:42,706
Calm, and Code Runner coming out in the last year.

618
00:37:43,626 --> 00:37:46,967
I think there are a couple more, but these are just some

619
00:37:47,007 --> 00:37:47,488
examples.

620
00:37:49,508 --> 00:37:52,169
And as you can see, when I talked about the themes here,

621
00:37:53,806 --> 00:37:56,127
Please Stay Calm and Zombie Hood are about zombies.

622
00:37:56,627 --> 00:37:59,088
Life is Crime is about crime, obviously.

623
00:37:59,649 --> 00:38:01,089
Code Runner is a little bit different.

624
00:38:01,109 --> 00:38:01,970
It's about agents.

625
00:38:04,511 --> 00:38:05,892
Go War is quite different.

626
00:38:05,932 --> 00:38:06,892
It's about tanks, even.

627
00:38:07,613 --> 00:38:11,614
And Stinktopia, well, you have a factory in the clouds

628
00:38:11,754 --> 00:38:14,916
where you build smelly chemical compounds,

629
00:38:14,976 --> 00:38:17,257
and then you throw stink bombs on your friends.

630
00:38:18,438 --> 00:38:20,138
So they have a novel theme, at least.

631
00:38:22,303 --> 00:38:23,624
Also in these images, I think you

632
00:38:23,664 --> 00:38:26,965
can see the difficulty of turning the Google Map

633
00:38:27,065 --> 00:38:29,165
into a game-like thingy.

634
00:38:33,967 --> 00:38:37,508
So we have the huge challenge of educating the players,

635
00:38:38,288 --> 00:38:41,109
teaching them what are location-based games,

636
00:38:41,229 --> 00:38:43,549
how do you play them, why are they fun.

637
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:48,351
But then again, we get to define the genre ourselves.

638
00:38:49,731 --> 00:38:50,771
When you look at shadows, it is.

639
00:38:52,186 --> 00:38:55,289
and fire it up and play with it for two minutes,

640
00:38:55,489 --> 00:38:57,510
you can see that our vision distance on the map,

641
00:38:57,991 --> 00:38:59,172
it's about 500 meters.

642
00:39:00,553 --> 00:39:02,775
When we chose that 500 meters, it

643
00:39:02,815 --> 00:39:04,296
was a fairly arbitrary decision.

644
00:39:05,697 --> 00:39:07,218
We wanted it to be something where

645
00:39:07,238 --> 00:39:08,519
you can see a little bit around you,

646
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:09,660
but not too much around you.

647
00:39:10,761 --> 00:39:12,703
But after you give shadow cities to someone

648
00:39:12,743 --> 00:39:15,365
who hasn't been there in the process of thinking

649
00:39:15,385 --> 00:39:18,327
that 500 meters, it feels pretty obvious

650
00:39:18,367 --> 00:39:19,428
that this is the right distance.

651
00:39:20,533 --> 00:39:26,096
I'm not sure if it's at all obvious, but by doing this kind of decisions and hopefully

652
00:39:26,156 --> 00:39:31,059
inspiring other people's making location-based games, they will follow in some of these decisions

653
00:39:31,219 --> 00:39:34,181
and we can see kind of the watermark we have left on the scene.

654
00:39:35,842 --> 00:39:37,743
We're actually happy to see the competition.

655
00:39:39,213 --> 00:39:42,734
We don't think that the other six games and so forth are

656
00:39:43,035 --> 00:39:46,115
really competing for the same players that we are trying to

657
00:39:46,296 --> 00:39:49,496
grab, because the truth is that there is no such thing as a

658
00:39:49,536 --> 00:39:53,017
location-based player base as a huge entity.

659
00:39:53,498 --> 00:39:55,418
I think most of the location-based players play

660
00:39:55,738 --> 00:39:59,399
either Shadow Cities or Life is Crime or one of the couple

661
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:00,540
of previous games.

662
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:04,681
So we're actually trying to create customers, not fighting

663
00:40:04,761 --> 00:40:05,041
over them.

664
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:12,083
The future, of course, hopefully, is going to be not

665
00:40:12,223 --> 00:40:15,245
only location-based, but also context-based.

666
00:40:17,367 --> 00:40:20,369
Your physical, your social, your temporal, and cultural

667
00:40:20,409 --> 00:40:22,331
context can all be leveraged for game play.

668
00:40:23,492 --> 00:40:28,216
We like to say that our rain effect in Shadow Cities is the

669
00:40:28,256 --> 00:40:29,337
best in the game market.

670
00:40:30,037 --> 00:40:32,659
Because if it rains in Shadow Cities, you really get wet,

671
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,701
unlike in any other game.

672
00:40:35,944 --> 00:40:38,947
We're keen on finding out what other kind of context can be

673
00:40:39,367 --> 00:40:41,990
included in this kind of gaming, whether it comes from Go,

674
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:43,771
Align, Foursquare, or elsewhere.

675
00:40:46,073 --> 00:40:49,336
But then again, we have to think about whether the map-based

676
00:40:49,396 --> 00:40:51,758
gaming is the future of location-based.

677
00:40:54,212 --> 00:40:58,133
If you remove the map and you just stick to the locations,

678
00:40:58,753 --> 00:41:00,033
you will lose a couple of things.

679
00:41:00,653 --> 00:41:02,634
Great things, we love some of these things.

680
00:41:03,034 --> 00:41:04,754
You will lose the feeling of here and now.

681
00:41:05,174 --> 00:41:07,675
You will lose the feeling of wow when you

682
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,215
see your own home in the game.

683
00:41:09,475 --> 00:41:10,675
You will lose the feeling of seeing

684
00:41:10,715 --> 00:41:13,296
that the other guy is there and now I'm busting his ass.

685
00:41:15,156 --> 00:41:18,097
But on the other hand, you can also

686
00:41:18,177 --> 00:41:19,457
solve a couple of problems with that.

687
00:41:20,297 --> 00:41:23,318
For instance, regarding the critical math issue.

688
00:41:27,257 --> 00:41:30,561
you can pretty much hide the fact whether there is a critical mass or not.

689
00:41:31,362 --> 00:41:38,148
Because you're not strictly binding yourself into this precise and exact visualization

690
00:41:38,168 --> 00:41:41,672
of the game world we are using. You can just say that there are 10 players

691
00:41:41,712 --> 00:41:47,457
around you and not care whether they are 10 meters around you or, you know, within the

692
00:41:47,497 --> 00:41:49,600
radius of 100 kilometers.

693
00:41:52,304 --> 00:41:56,628
You will lose the map scaling issues and positioning issues.

694
00:41:56,888 --> 00:41:58,470
You can save a lot of battery power.

695
00:41:59,491 --> 00:42:03,075
So we're also keeping our eyes open for that.

696
00:42:04,596 --> 00:42:07,159
Location has many other meanings than just the map.

697
00:42:11,884 --> 00:42:13,806
Reaching towards the conclusion of my presentation.

698
00:42:15,136 --> 00:42:20,519
I want to tell a story, just an example of an experience that we have made possible,

699
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:25,142
something that was utterly impossible in any game before Shadows It Is.

700
00:42:26,563 --> 00:42:31,046
As you know, every year there is a memorial for the victims of the 9-11 strikes in New

701
00:42:31,066 --> 00:42:31,306
York.

702
00:42:31,907 --> 00:42:37,790
They erect these two pillars of light near the location of where the Twin Towers once

703
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:38,050
were.

704
00:42:39,071 --> 00:42:43,914
Our players in Shadows It Is wanted to observe this memorial, so this is what they did.

705
00:42:45,378 --> 00:42:47,500
They went into the Manhattan in the game world.

706
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,440
They invited their friends all over the world.

707
00:42:49,821 --> 00:42:53,002
And they created the beacons from the beacons of shadows,

708
00:42:53,042 --> 00:42:57,104
it is, in order to replicate the same memorial

709
00:42:57,144 --> 00:42:57,925
in the virtual world.

710
00:42:58,905 --> 00:43:01,186
And this is, again, one example of the emergent content

711
00:43:01,206 --> 00:43:04,828
you get for free when you're using the planet

712
00:43:04,868 --> 00:43:05,488
as your playground.

713
00:43:08,345 --> 00:43:14,430
Don Norman said, we grow to love the objects that connect us to other people, create meaning,

714
00:43:14,751 --> 00:43:16,392
and remind us that we are alive.

715
00:43:18,954 --> 00:43:21,896
At Gray Area, we believe in this quite strongly.

716
00:43:22,297 --> 00:43:25,159
We believe that they come for the game, but they stay for the community.

717
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:29,943
And we believe that we can use the real world to create a lot of meanings, a lot of social

718
00:43:30,023 --> 00:43:37,850
content, a lot of anchoring points for players who can then stay for the community and enjoy

719
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:38,030
the game.

720
00:43:38,453 --> 00:43:47,898
the global game layer we are providing them. Even though they come for the game, they stay

721
00:43:47,918 --> 00:43:55,382
for the community, it's a truism for all MMORPG field. We believe that we can create a community

722
00:43:55,422 --> 00:43:59,864
that's quite different from the others, because our community is based on location, based

723
00:43:59,904 --> 00:44:06,387
on neighbors, based on where you live, and based on how you move around in the real world.

724
00:44:09,953 --> 00:44:14,695
So this is our vision. Your city is a game. All cities are different. What kind of game

725
00:44:14,755 --> 00:44:21,398
would your city be? Shadow Cities is our first stab at mastering the art of location-based

726
00:44:21,418 --> 00:44:28,000
gaming and map-based gaming, but we believe that we can surpass it with our next title

727
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:35,244
that's coming out later this year quite well. Even though we have uncovered a lot of hazards

728
00:44:35,344 --> 00:44:37,845
and troubles on the way to where we are now at 17 people.

729
00:44:41,466 --> 00:44:45,009
We are pretty proud that we've accomplished what we've accomplished, and we're pretty

730
00:44:45,149 --> 00:44:49,793
proud that we created the first location-based MMORPG, at least as far as we know.

731
00:44:51,534 --> 00:44:57,999
We have not chosen an easy path, and we've found many challenges, but we also believe

732
00:44:58,019 --> 00:45:02,202
that there is a very good market that can be uncovered by capturing this new field.

733
00:45:04,704 --> 00:45:05,025
Thank you.

734
00:45:14,756 --> 00:45:16,337
So if you have questions or comments,

735
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:17,878
please use the microphones.

736
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:29,006
Hi.

737
00:45:29,286 --> 00:45:30,807
Congratulations for the presentation.

738
00:45:30,867 --> 00:45:31,528
Very interesting.

739
00:45:32,669 --> 00:45:34,090
Yeah, I have a lot of questions, actually,

740
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:35,691
but I'll go just for a few of them.

741
00:45:35,731 --> 00:45:36,931
Then maybe I'll come later.

742
00:45:38,393 --> 00:45:40,154
So one is a bit technical.

743
00:45:40,194 --> 00:45:41,315
So how did you solve the problems

744
00:45:41,335 --> 00:45:42,255
with the map in the end?

745
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:46,130
How did we solve the problems with the map?

746
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:51,014
Yeah, in terms of design and look and, you know,

747
00:45:51,514 --> 00:45:53,956
removing some buildings that you don't want in the map, et cetera.

748
00:45:54,416 --> 00:45:54,637
Right.

749
00:45:55,838 --> 00:45:59,521
Personally, I'm a game designer and my background is in humanities.

750
00:46:00,161 --> 00:46:03,404
So I might not be the right person to answer that question, unfortunately.

751
00:46:04,124 --> 00:46:09,509
But our CTO Mikko is here, so you can probably ask him after the presentation.

752
00:46:09,529 --> 00:46:11,891
So that's one of the questions I'll keep for later.

753
00:46:12,691 --> 00:46:14,392
And I think we have another there, but can...

754
00:46:15,553 --> 00:46:25,359
Okay, yeah. So, as a game designer using the real world as your level, as your map, how

755
00:46:25,379 --> 00:46:30,281
did you, and using this kind of large connected experience, how did you go about testing and

756
00:46:30,341 --> 00:46:31,342
iterating on your concepts?

757
00:46:32,303 --> 00:46:38,847
We test and iterate a lot, and we do it like, I guess it's some kind of a social gaming

758
00:46:39,207 --> 00:46:41,768
tradition nowadays. We iterate on the fly pretty much.

759
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:46,270
So every week in Shadows it is, there's a campaign that has a

760
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:49,651
couple of rule changes, especially during the beta and

761
00:46:49,851 --> 00:46:51,091
after the global launch.

762
00:46:51,532 --> 00:46:54,532
We were putting out these week-long campaigns a lot.

763
00:46:55,193 --> 00:46:57,573
And we're constantly looking at our metrics and see what

764
00:46:57,613 --> 00:46:58,454
works, see what doesn't.

765
00:46:59,554 --> 00:47:01,494
It's kind of mandatory, actually, because the world is

766
00:47:01,534 --> 00:47:03,255
huge and we have a lot of players, and it's a very

767
00:47:03,295 --> 00:47:05,375
complex game in terms of interactions and

768
00:47:05,776 --> 00:47:06,676
emergent behaviors.

769
00:47:07,296 --> 00:47:12,744
So the only way to really test this kind of thing is to kind of put it out there and see what happens and then tweak it on the run.

770
00:47:13,605 --> 00:47:15,708
Can you say anything about the user testing you did before launch?

771
00:47:16,288 --> 00:47:16,549
Come again?

772
00:47:16,809 --> 00:47:20,514
Can you say anything about the user testing you did before you launched the game? Did you do any of that?

773
00:47:21,155 --> 00:47:30,041
We had an alpha for friends and family, but in all cases like this one, when you engage

774
00:47:30,061 --> 00:47:35,285
your real player base, then you're going to hit the wall pretty hard. So we had to do

775
00:47:35,305 --> 00:47:40,749
a couple of big changes in the beta. So we first opened the game in Finland only, and

776
00:47:40,789 --> 00:47:45,212
we were looking very closely at what players did and how they worked. And we were doing

777
00:47:45,272 --> 00:47:47,013
radical changes in the game at that time.

778
00:47:50,894 --> 00:47:55,719
Yeah, you'd mentioned that some of your users have been doing stuff like integrating folklore,

779
00:47:55,779 --> 00:47:57,241
local history into the game.

780
00:47:57,461 --> 00:48:00,604
I was wondering if you could explain some of the ways in which that's happening and

781
00:48:00,644 --> 00:48:04,368
whether or not you've modified any of the mechanics of the game or introduced any new

782
00:48:04,949 --> 00:48:08,072
mechanics to sort of foster that or accommodate it.

783
00:48:09,034 --> 00:48:14,997
what makes it possible in Shadow Cities is that we are very sparse in terms of visual and textual

784
00:48:15,057 --> 00:48:20,299
information. So we don't tell much about the world, we just say you are a mage and we show

785
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:25,042
you the world and then you get a very short mission descriptions.

786
00:48:26,122 --> 00:48:31,745
Uh, all our spirits are entities from the real world mythology, so we have Valkyries and whatever you can fight.

787
00:48:32,705 --> 00:48:38,488
But, because the game is also very abstract, it's a, it's a kind of a black hole that you can fill with whatever you want to.

788
00:48:38,968 --> 00:48:40,629
So that is basically the, the thing.

789
00:48:41,049 --> 00:48:44,571
But most of the fan fiction stuff and that kind of thing happens in our forums.

790
00:48:45,071 --> 00:48:49,073
So it's sort of just like accessory to, it's not yet been integrated into, uh...

791
00:48:49,933 --> 00:48:50,674
That is correct.

792
00:48:51,114 --> 00:48:51,774
Cool, thanks.

793
00:48:52,595 --> 00:48:52,695
Yeah.

794
00:48:53,811 --> 00:48:57,453
Sorry, I'll go with the second question. This is more commercial.

795
00:48:58,114 --> 00:49:01,395
Can you disclose anything about the revenues of the game, or in general,

796
00:49:01,975 --> 00:49:05,117
if you did some market analysis, what the potential is for this kind of games?

797
00:49:05,758 --> 00:49:09,119
We haven't released any player figures, but then again, that

798
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:11,301
wouldn't be the right way of looking at Shadow Cities

799
00:49:11,401 --> 00:49:11,641
either.

800
00:49:12,621 --> 00:49:16,163
We are not aiming at the casual or hyper-casual market here.

801
00:49:16,743 --> 00:49:21,526
Instead, we believe that gamers who really get into the game

802
00:49:21,566 --> 00:49:22,966
monetize better.

803
00:49:23,306 --> 00:49:24,827
And that is actually true for our game.

804
00:49:25,427 --> 00:49:29,049
Our lifetime value of player is pretty high.

805
00:49:29,369 --> 00:49:31,130
So that is what we go for.

806
00:49:32,311 --> 00:49:32,491
Thanks.

807
00:49:36,062 --> 00:49:44,387
Hi. You mentioned you're the first LBG. In fact, the military and various homeland defense

808
00:49:45,127 --> 00:49:51,771
organizations have been using similar things to this for some years. They're even now blending

809
00:49:51,971 --> 00:50:00,415
or mixing so-called LVC, trading live, virtual, and constructive, where you can be in different

810
00:50:00,475 --> 00:50:01,756
worlds at the same time.

811
00:50:03,508 --> 00:50:07,231
It's very expensive, of course, to model a city in 3D.

812
00:50:08,212 --> 00:50:09,393
Movies are doing it.

813
00:50:09,533 --> 00:50:16,358
I know several companies quite well that are 3D mapping for their movies and their different

814
00:50:16,398 --> 00:50:17,179
franchises.

815
00:50:17,559 --> 00:50:20,502
The military and others are mapping.

816
00:50:20,982 --> 00:50:26,046
Have you considered partnering or working with some of these people that have 3D maps?

817
00:50:28,715 --> 00:50:31,398
So the question of whether we have considered

818
00:50:31,618 --> 00:50:35,081
partnering with people who are using 3D maps of cities.

819
00:50:37,223 --> 00:50:40,706
I guess the big challenge there is that the world is huge,

820
00:50:41,007 --> 00:50:42,168
and we have players everywhere.

821
00:50:42,648 --> 00:50:47,032
So if we wanted to, I mean, that kind of design approach

822
00:50:47,072 --> 00:50:50,375
would force us to focus on big cities like New York and San

823
00:50:50,415 --> 00:50:50,896
Francisco.

824
00:50:52,227 --> 00:50:55,831
I'm not sure if the player base exists as large enough in those cities,

825
00:50:56,692 --> 00:51:01,316
but I gotta say it would be the coolest experience I could imagine in this kind of game, probably.

826
00:51:03,083 --> 00:51:04,565
Hi Aurelius, I'm Bitey Bat.

827
00:51:05,545 --> 00:51:07,667
Thank you for letting me crash your presentation.

828
00:51:09,308 --> 00:51:12,110
I had a question about the core game loop of Shadow Cities.

829
00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:14,512
It's a very transitory, transient experience,

830
00:51:14,572 --> 00:51:15,493
really quick gameplay.

831
00:51:15,533 --> 00:51:18,035
And I wondered if there was any thought in the design process

832
00:51:18,095 --> 00:51:21,137
to extending that to a greater permanence

833
00:51:21,457 --> 00:51:23,258
of the augmented reality that you're creating in-game,

834
00:51:23,278 --> 00:51:26,381
creating structures that have a longer lifespan in-game

835
00:51:26,481 --> 00:51:29,123
versus the quick core loop of the game currently.

836
00:51:30,323 --> 00:51:34,167
The question was about the session length in our game.

837
00:51:36,029 --> 00:51:40,173
We believe that the most important thing

838
00:51:40,293 --> 00:51:42,215
is to make the two-minute sessions possible.

839
00:51:42,775 --> 00:51:45,057
So that is the real thing.

840
00:51:45,418 --> 00:51:46,619
And everything else is a bonus.

841
00:51:47,079 --> 00:51:50,323
So I think in the foreseeable future,

842
00:51:50,363 --> 00:51:52,385
we'll stick to fairly short sessions.

843
00:51:54,487 --> 00:51:55,327
I'm not sure about that.

844
00:51:55,988 --> 00:52:00,010
Also, our players are having those mammoth sessions of 60

845
00:52:00,110 --> 00:52:02,172
minutes or longer because they are just watching over some

846
00:52:02,212 --> 00:52:02,592
neighborhood.

847
00:52:03,052 --> 00:52:04,673
So I think we already have that.

848
00:52:05,134 --> 00:52:09,136
I'm not sure if we should support that any deeper.

849
00:52:09,637 --> 00:52:12,438
And kind of on a related note, what was the driving force

850
00:52:12,478 --> 00:52:15,160
behind the decision, at least in the states, to change the

851
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:18,622
battle group size from individual state by state to

852
00:52:18,702 --> 00:52:20,183
entire regions of the country?

853
00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:26,891
The question was about our battle group sizes, so that's nitty gritty in the game mechanics.

854
00:52:27,631 --> 00:52:32,813
It was that since we have two size battling, we want each player to have a bigger feeling

855
00:52:32,853 --> 00:52:35,134
of impact in the struggle.

856
00:52:35,594 --> 00:52:40,775
So if you're one of the thousand, you're feeling less important than if you're one of the hundred.

857
00:52:40,795 --> 00:52:45,637
And I guess that was my question, is I think there was a tighter sense of community in

858
00:52:45,657 --> 00:52:48,478
the original size, and it's with the expansion, I think there's...

859
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:53,953
I think the answer there is whenever you touch your community in terms of game design, they

860
00:52:53,993 --> 00:52:56,073
are going to complain about it.

861
00:52:56,093 --> 00:53:04,516
That's also what's happened in MMORPG scene when World of Warcraft went from 40 people

862
00:53:04,576 --> 00:53:09,457
raids to 25 people raids because people had to break their guilds, they had to lose their

863
00:53:09,517 --> 00:53:11,438
friends because Blizzard changed it.

864
00:53:12,939 --> 00:53:18,684
when we changed our battle group system we encountered the same problem. We touched something

865
00:53:18,724 --> 00:53:23,668
that they had built for themselves and had learned and that is always a kind of a messy

866
00:53:23,688 --> 00:53:33,877
thing to do. Thank you. Hi, just a simple question, how is your target audience segmented

867
00:53:33,917 --> 00:53:38,221
when it comes to gender and age? Mostly men.

868
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:51,792
A little bit old. A percentage? I don't remember exactly but I would say 25-75 maybe. 75% male,

869
00:53:52,812 --> 00:54:01,455
roughly. In terms of age I would say they're adults, so they're 18 and upwards. But then

870
00:54:01,495 --> 00:54:05,676
again that's because we primarily are on iPhone and that's the iPhone demographic.

871
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:19,983
Hi, I had a question. You touched on it earlier about new players and lobby zones and that kind of thing, which is kind of, you know, a problem you're going to find with MMOs in general.

872
00:54:20,743 --> 00:54:25,665
And in location-based gaming, you showed the map of, like, the United States covered in green and that kind of thing.

873
00:54:26,505 --> 00:54:33,987
Do you find it's harder to get new players into Shadow Cities now that it has such a strong community and relatively stronger players,

874
00:54:34,347 --> 00:54:37,128
that it can be almost intimidating for a new player to step in?

875
00:54:38,009 --> 00:54:43,561
and you know constantly get killed or struck down and are you doing anything to try and address that?

876
00:54:45,357 --> 00:54:50,459
The question was, do we have trouble getting new players engaged with Shadow Cities now

877
00:54:50,479 --> 00:54:56,163
that the community is on level 18? I guess that is something that happens with all games,

878
00:54:57,063 --> 00:55:02,426
that the people who come into the game very early are going to feel like they are the

879
00:55:02,506 --> 00:55:07,509
original players and they are going to be a part of the maturing community. I think

880
00:55:07,549 --> 00:55:12,572
that is something that happens to every MMORPG. And yes, it also happens in Shadow Cities.

881
00:55:13,392 --> 00:55:19,814
But then again that's been the norm in Shadow Cities because people level to the maximum level in, well, a month maybe.

882
00:55:20,335 --> 00:55:24,816
So I think for the most of Shadow Cities lifetime that has been the case.

883
00:55:25,056 --> 00:55:28,877
And of course I think it's the case in, say, World of Warcraft as well.

884
00:55:29,858 --> 00:55:30,118
Thank you.

885
00:55:31,798 --> 00:55:33,479
I think we have the two last questions.

886
00:55:34,458 --> 00:55:36,261
Actually, my question was very similar to his.

887
00:55:36,421 --> 00:55:39,266
So I mean, I've thought about LBS for a lot.

888
00:55:39,366 --> 00:55:41,049
And my question was very similar in the sense

889
00:55:41,089 --> 00:55:44,054
that how do you deal with a case where a new user joins

890
00:55:44,434 --> 00:55:47,058
and say, like, I play from home, and all my neighbors

891
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:48,060
are, like, really mean?

892
00:55:48,859 --> 00:55:53,401
and they won't let me do anything, but because I'm stuck to LBS I can't actually

893
00:55:54,081 --> 00:55:57,782
change to like another place. I need to physically move in order to start over.

894
00:55:59,923 --> 00:56:04,965
Precisely the question is what we would do when you're surrounded by enemies and you start

895
00:56:05,325 --> 00:56:10,587
from level one and they keep beating your ass. And that is actually a big challenge.

896
00:56:11,127 --> 00:56:16,129
In Shadow Cities you're protected until you reach level six or seven, so no one can attack you

897
00:56:16,209 --> 00:56:17,090
unless you hit them first.

898
00:56:18,217 --> 00:56:25,183
On longer term, we believe that in that point the player has learned to move in the world as well.

899
00:56:25,523 --> 00:56:29,786
So they can travel to other people's beacons and they can find some quires.

900
00:56:29,827 --> 00:56:33,149
So their base can actually not be their home.

901
00:56:33,249 --> 00:56:36,652
Their foundation base can be not where they actually are.

902
00:56:37,413 --> 00:56:38,534
They can move completely away.

903
00:56:41,596 --> 00:56:43,758
More or less they could be playing the game not location based.

904
00:56:45,756 --> 00:56:48,197
Yes, they can move virtually in the game.

905
00:56:48,337 --> 00:56:48,517
Yes.

906
00:56:49,197 --> 00:56:49,417
Thank you.

907
00:56:49,897 --> 00:56:50,697
OK, the last question.

908
00:56:50,977 --> 00:56:52,258
Yeah, hi.

909
00:56:52,318 --> 00:56:53,618
My company, we build sports games.

910
00:56:53,718 --> 00:56:55,938
You mentioned, you talked about different genres,

911
00:56:55,959 --> 00:56:57,539
like zombies, mafias, and stuff like that.

912
00:56:57,579 --> 00:56:59,579
Do you see location-based systems

913
00:57:00,199 --> 00:57:03,760
being able to implement sports games in that genre?

914
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:04,801
That's, I guess, number one question.

915
00:57:04,821 --> 00:57:06,761
Number two, I guess, it's part of that same question,

916
00:57:06,821 --> 00:57:11,182
is that where do you see location-based technology going

917
00:57:11,262 --> 00:57:13,563
forward, and how is that going to enhance different genres

918
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:14,503
and development-wise?

919
00:57:15,003 --> 00:57:18,186
The questions was about sports games and location-based games

920
00:57:18,566 --> 00:57:21,268
and also the location-based gaming technologies.

921
00:57:22,369 --> 00:57:23,410
Regarding sport games,

922
00:57:24,931 --> 00:57:26,092
I haven't really thought about that,

923
00:57:26,532 --> 00:57:28,954
but I would imagine that if you had a game in the stadium

924
00:57:29,334 --> 00:57:31,496
where everyone in the stadium could participate

925
00:57:31,556 --> 00:57:34,398
in whatever betting for the end result of the match,

926
00:57:34,739 --> 00:57:35,199
that could be...

927
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:38,602
That's my first idea, and I think that might be sellable.

928
00:57:39,723 --> 00:57:42,905
The future of location-based gaming technology...

929
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:47,422
As a company, we are only interested in mass market

930
00:57:47,462 --> 00:57:49,663
technologies like iPhone and Android and that kind of stuff.

931
00:57:50,563 --> 00:57:53,245
And I'm not sure if there are going to be big changes in the

932
00:57:53,585 --> 00:57:54,125
near future.

933
00:57:54,826 --> 00:57:55,486
I don't think there are.

934
00:57:55,506 --> 00:57:57,047
All right, thank you.

935
00:57:58,628 --> 00:57:58,948
Thank you.

936
00:57:59,688 --> 00:58:03,790
And please remember to fill your feedback forms, and also

937
00:58:03,850 --> 00:58:06,712
check your spam filters for the evaluation forms, because

938
00:58:06,752 --> 00:58:07,653
apparently they get stuck.

939
00:58:08,653 --> 00:58:11,435
And if you're interested in this stuff, please get the

940
00:58:11,455 --> 00:58:13,776
book, Pervasive Games, from this address.

941
00:58:15,088 --> 00:58:15,351
Thank you.
