1
00:00:06,042 --> 00:00:07,283
What to write so people buy.

2
00:00:07,523 --> 00:00:09,003
Selling your game without feeling sleazy.

3
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:12,185
I know, I get it.

4
00:00:12,205 --> 00:00:13,725
This is probably what you think of marketing.

5
00:00:13,785 --> 00:00:15,546
It's, you can use car salesmen.

6
00:00:15,966 --> 00:00:17,947
You're probably like a one-person shop or something

7
00:00:17,987 --> 00:00:19,688
and you just really want to make a game.

8
00:00:19,868 --> 00:00:21,128
You don't really like the marketing thing,

9
00:00:21,168 --> 00:00:22,589
but you do it because you know you have to.

10
00:00:23,209 --> 00:00:25,890
Or maybe you're a part of five-person studio, right?

11
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:28,931
Or you got the short straw and you have to do marketing

12
00:00:28,951 --> 00:00:30,632
because you're the nice one or something, right?

13
00:00:31,172 --> 00:00:32,273
I get it, I get it.

14
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:32,933
And...

15
00:00:33,619 --> 00:00:36,780
That's kind of why I wanted to do this talk is I wanted to prove to you and

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,802
show you the ways so that it doesn't feel sleazy like this, it's something

17
00:00:40,822 --> 00:00:46,524
kind of enjoyable and I'm not going to teach like weird Twitter tricks or what

18
00:00:46,544 --> 00:00:48,485
the latest thing is or how to use Tik Tok.

19
00:00:49,045 --> 00:00:51,486
What I really want to teach you is fundamentals of marketing.

20
00:00:51,606 --> 00:00:56,608
It's like one-on-one basic levels of marketing so that you're not always

21
00:00:56,668 --> 00:01:00,369
jumping from whatever's hot this year versus next year versus in two years.

22
00:01:02,174 --> 00:01:05,497
Last year was Discord, this year it's TikTok. Who knows what it's going to be in a year.

23
00:01:05,978 --> 00:01:10,742
I want to teach you the real fundamentals, not tricks, nothing sleazy. I just want to teach you

24
00:01:10,822 --> 00:01:16,108
really good basics here. This is me, my name is Chris Zukowski. I'm an indie game designer. I've

25
00:01:16,128 --> 00:01:20,032
released a couple games on Steam. I'm also a marketing consultant and I help companies

26
00:01:20,352 --> 00:01:25,758
market their games too. This is my game that I released on Steam, One Screen, Platformer.

27
00:01:26,757 --> 00:01:28,800
And according to some of the reviews,

28
00:01:29,221 --> 00:01:30,702
according to this guy specifically,

29
00:01:30,843 --> 00:01:33,446
I'm the dev that's the most enthusiastic

30
00:01:33,486 --> 00:01:34,628
in the history of Steam.

31
00:01:35,389 --> 00:01:36,971
So you're welcome.

32
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:38,553
Congratulations, you're talking

33
00:01:38,573 --> 00:01:40,275
to the most enthusiastic dev.

34
00:01:41,196 --> 00:01:43,259
I've also had a lot of success on Imgur.

35
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:45,401
I've reached the front page at least four times.

36
00:01:46,961 --> 00:01:48,783
And I'm also the author of Quest of Courage.

37
00:01:48,883 --> 00:01:50,104
If you haven't heard of it,

38
00:01:50,464 --> 00:01:53,347
it was my fifth grade creative writing assignment,

39
00:01:53,407 --> 00:01:56,350
which actually was just a long journal

40
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,532
of all the video games I was playing at the time.

41
00:01:58,572 --> 00:02:00,594
On the left are my illustrations during this book.

42
00:02:00,634 --> 00:02:01,215
Now, I...

43
00:02:02,056 --> 00:02:08,301
It was totally bonkers. I was just narrating my hijinks in video games. But the school awarded

44
00:02:08,341 --> 00:02:13,907
me the Historical Fiction Award for this book, I guess. They didn't even know what to do with me.

45
00:02:14,627 --> 00:02:20,453
But all that is to say, I've basically been a content video game marketer since I was 10 years

46
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:26,538
old. So that's kind of the history I bring to you and where I come from here. But I also am

47
00:02:26,578 --> 00:02:27,399
a marketing consultant.

48
00:02:27,653 --> 00:02:34,090
So I strategize with brands and companies on how they can best use their own community

49
00:02:34,311 --> 00:02:36,577
to market their games. So these are some of my clients.

50
00:02:38,183 --> 00:02:40,484
Now, I'm going to break this down into five major parts.

51
00:02:40,864 --> 00:02:43,345
I'm going to just show you the basics, the one-on-one level stuff,

52
00:02:43,525 --> 00:02:44,425
how does marketing work.

53
00:02:44,725 --> 00:02:46,926
I'm going to show you how to build a marketing strategy

54
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:48,647
so that you're not just grasping at things,

55
00:02:48,667 --> 00:02:50,448
not just tweeting for the sake of tweeting.

56
00:02:50,868 --> 00:02:53,189
And I'm also going to show you how to act on that strategy.

57
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:55,770
And I'll show you short tutorials on email marketing,

58
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:56,750
because that's my favorite.

59
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:57,771
I love email marketing.

60
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:00,051
And then I'm going to show you some real-life examples

61
00:03:00,091 --> 00:03:01,732
of how this all kind of comes together.

62
00:03:02,632 --> 00:03:03,513
How does marketing work?

63
00:03:05,045 --> 00:03:08,926
Basically, marketing is just a bunch of big squares that you've got to fill out.

64
00:03:08,946 --> 00:03:09,727
Here's Steam.

65
00:03:10,287 --> 00:03:12,768
Twitter's just a giant blank square that you have to fill out.

66
00:03:13,368 --> 00:03:13,809
Here it is.

67
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:18,391
This is your email service provider, like MailChimp, more blank boxes.

68
00:03:18,931 --> 00:03:22,632
Even if you're not writing, even if it's something visual like YouTube,

69
00:03:22,893 --> 00:03:25,013
you still have to fill words in.

70
00:03:25,234 --> 00:03:27,515
You have to create titles, create descriptions.

71
00:03:27,995 --> 00:03:31,376
So basically all of this and all of this marketing, all these different

72
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:34,698
platforms that you might have to enter stuff into is copy.

73
00:03:35,325 --> 00:03:39,088
Copy is what goes in these blank spaces. It's just the words that sell.

74
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:42,691
What I want to do today is show you how to love this stuff,

75
00:03:43,011 --> 00:03:47,294
how to actually enjoy filling in these giant blank spaces with your words.

76
00:03:48,435 --> 00:03:51,377
Okay, I'm also going to teach you one very important rule of marketing,

77
00:03:51,658 --> 00:03:54,740
and I think it's something that everybody needs to work on, and it's this.

78
00:03:57,962 --> 00:04:01,705
Always have a call to action. And I'll explain that a little bit,

79
00:04:01,926 --> 00:04:03,907
but it is one of the most fundamental things to have.

80
00:04:05,494 --> 00:04:09,336
Okay, so pep talk, like I said, it is not sleazy to love marketing.

81
00:04:09,676 --> 00:04:12,257
Marketing is one of the best things that we can do to promote our games.

82
00:04:12,997 --> 00:04:16,258
And a lot of people hate marketing because they think of it as coercion.

83
00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:19,460
But coercion in marketing never works.

84
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,841
You can't convince somebody who wouldn't already like your game to like it.

85
00:04:24,107 --> 00:04:28,050
The goal of marketing is actually to find somebody who's predisposed to like your game

86
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:32,374
and show them and prove to them that this is exactly the type of game that they want.

87
00:04:32,794 --> 00:04:37,038
If somebody doesn't like FPSs and you're making an FPS, no amount of marketing,

88
00:04:37,358 --> 00:04:40,241
no amount of dollars or ad spend is going to convert that person.

89
00:04:40,581 --> 00:04:41,942
That's not what we're trying to do here.

90
00:04:42,202 --> 00:04:45,085
We're really trying to find the right audience and say the right words to them

91
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:48,327
to make sure that your game is shown to the right people.

92
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:49,228
That's all it is.

93
00:04:50,997 --> 00:04:54,680
There's this famous quote from a famous marketer named Zig Ziglar, and he said,

94
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,422
selling is essentially a transfer of feelings.

95
00:04:57,303 --> 00:05:00,526
And I think about that a lot when I read a lot of indie game marketing.

96
00:05:00,606 --> 00:05:03,368
I subscribe to a lot of newsletters and read a lot of tweets.

97
00:05:03,388 --> 00:05:08,493
And I read some copy that's from game developers, well-meaning developers,

98
00:05:08,513 --> 00:05:11,616
but they say things like, I hope you don't mind getting this email, or if

99
00:05:11,636 --> 00:05:13,978
you're not interested, you can unsubscribe at the bottom, but before

100
00:05:13,998 --> 00:05:14,699
Warren, don't cry.

101
00:05:15,602 --> 00:05:19,245
If marketing is a transfer of feelings, what kind of feelings are we transferring here?

102
00:05:19,685 --> 00:05:24,368
That's not good. And I'm serious here. Please, let's stop that kind of language.

103
00:05:24,848 --> 00:05:28,731
It's just knock it off. It's not helping your marketing. It's not making you feel any better.

104
00:05:29,211 --> 00:05:32,133
So really, I'm going to show you the right way to have the right message for people.

105
00:05:33,354 --> 00:05:35,035
Okay, so let's talk about marketing strategy.

106
00:05:36,191 --> 00:05:38,293
Everything I talk about comes down to the funnel.

107
00:05:38,653 --> 00:05:40,495
I mentioned it in every talk I give,

108
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,617
just about every blog post mentions the funnel.

109
00:05:42,677 --> 00:05:44,098
It is a fundamental to marketing

110
00:05:44,398 --> 00:05:45,339
and you have to understand it.

111
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:47,261
So I'm gonna go real quick through the marketing funnel.

112
00:05:48,202 --> 00:05:50,604
The marketing funnel starts with four basic layers,

113
00:05:50,944 --> 00:05:53,306
awareness, interest, desire, and action.

114
00:05:53,646 --> 00:05:56,629
It's basically a top to bottom guide

115
00:05:56,729 --> 00:05:58,551
of how somebody will interface with your game

116
00:05:58,831 --> 00:05:59,972
and hopefully buy it in the end.

117
00:06:00,352 --> 00:06:02,434
It's as old as marketing is.

118
00:06:03,174 --> 00:06:06,034
Here's actually the movie Glenn Ross.

119
00:06:06,454 --> 00:06:08,235
This is Alec Baldwin pointing at the funnel,

120
00:06:08,395 --> 00:06:09,515
notice the A-I-B-A.

121
00:06:10,555 --> 00:06:13,076
And basically what happens is your goal as a marketer

122
00:06:13,176 --> 00:06:15,636
is to find a person that's gonna like your game

123
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,937
and they go from awareness, not knowing about your game,

124
00:06:18,117 --> 00:06:20,037
to being aware, to being interested in it,

125
00:06:20,257 --> 00:06:22,478
to being desire, to desire it, to buying it.

126
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:24,478
And so all you have to do is move somebody

127
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:25,859
from the start to the bottom

128
00:06:26,159 --> 00:06:28,759
and then you get them to buy your game.

129
00:06:29,059 --> 00:06:30,100
That's it, that's how it works.

130
00:06:31,204 --> 00:06:34,085
The hard part is that there's a lot of steps in between there.

131
00:06:34,466 --> 00:06:36,987
So let me show you an example of how this would actually work.

132
00:06:37,748 --> 00:06:40,790
So let's say you post something on Reddit and it goes viral,

133
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:42,150
makes it to the front page of Reddit.

134
00:06:42,671 --> 00:06:45,993
The person who just doesn't know about you just discovers your game

135
00:06:46,013 --> 00:06:46,853
through this Reddit post.

136
00:06:47,475 --> 00:06:49,476
And in the middle of that Reddit post, you say,

137
00:06:49,656 --> 00:06:51,158
hey, why don't you join my Twitter feed?

138
00:06:51,658 --> 00:06:53,259
So they subscribe to your Twitter,

139
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,381
and they say, ooh, this is actually pretty good.

140
00:06:55,461 --> 00:06:57,282
It's kind of interesting what you're posting here.

141
00:06:57,342 --> 00:06:58,503
So they follow you on Twitter.

142
00:06:59,143 --> 00:07:01,885
And as you post, you link off to your Steam page,

143
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:03,847
and they look at it, and they see screenshots

144
00:07:03,887 --> 00:07:05,888
and a trailer, and then they really like your game.

145
00:07:05,948 --> 00:07:08,490
They figure out that this is the perfect game for them.

146
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:09,871
And so now they desire it.

147
00:07:10,331 --> 00:07:17,793
And then eventually your game goes and finally launches, hopefully not at 75% off, but you offer a pretty honest discount and then they're in it.

148
00:07:17,893 --> 00:07:23,714
They are totally excited about your game. You guided them all levels of the funnel and they buy it.

149
00:07:23,754 --> 00:07:27,135
They're totally excited and they take that action. That is the funnel.

150
00:07:27,776 --> 00:07:31,617
Now the reason they call it a funnel and it has that kind of wedge-like shape is

151
00:07:32,284 --> 00:07:35,106
you just got to be honest. Not everybody is going to make it to the bottom of the funnel.

152
00:07:35,466 --> 00:07:39,609
Some people are going to start with awareness, like 500,000 people are going to view your red

153
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:44,472
post, but only 1,000 are actually going to go over and follow you on Twitter. And then a fewer

154
00:07:44,492 --> 00:07:48,836
number of those people are going to follow you on Steam. And then an even fewer number of those

155
00:07:48,876 --> 00:07:55,901
people are going to buy your game on Steam at the end. So it's a very precipitous drop that

156
00:07:55,921 --> 00:07:59,123
you just have to deal with. And it's one of the things you got to get used to with the marketing

157
00:07:59,163 --> 00:08:00,304
funnel. So

158
00:08:01,177 --> 00:08:04,418
Here's the hard part about working a funnel in copywriting,

159
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:08,640
is that you'll notice that from Reddit to Twitter to Steam,

160
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,322
those are all different platforms from different companies,

161
00:08:11,762 --> 00:08:13,363
and all of that is totally different.

162
00:08:13,623 --> 00:08:14,903
So you've got to actually get people

163
00:08:14,943 --> 00:08:17,465
from one login to the next to the next.

164
00:08:17,645 --> 00:08:19,306
It's really hard, and you're gonna lose people

165
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:20,786
at every single one of those jumps.

166
00:08:21,607 --> 00:08:22,947
And guess what comes in between those?

167
00:08:23,308 --> 00:08:25,148
It's good copywriting that's gonna get people

168
00:08:25,168 --> 00:08:26,109
from one to the next.

169
00:08:27,884 --> 00:08:30,046
So let me show you why they follow you.

170
00:08:30,126 --> 00:08:31,588
So here's a post that I made.

171
00:08:31,608 --> 00:08:33,470
This is the front page of Imgur, and that's mine.

172
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:36,894
The number one post on the front page of Imgur called Most Viral.

173
00:08:37,835 --> 00:08:41,099
And what happens is when they see your game on something viral like this,

174
00:08:41,499 --> 00:08:43,762
those people are like totally excited about you.

175
00:08:44,062 --> 00:08:46,605
They're just going to do that old throw, take my money.

176
00:08:46,645 --> 00:08:48,207
And then they're like waving it at you.

177
00:08:48,804 --> 00:08:52,086
Unfortunately, this feeling is not very long.

178
00:08:52,146 --> 00:08:53,847
They only like you for just a few seconds,

179
00:08:53,888 --> 00:08:55,228
because then there's going to be some other thing

180
00:08:55,248 --> 00:08:57,730
they're going to be excited about right under you.

181
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:00,892
So you've got to capture this feeling while you can.

182
00:09:01,432 --> 00:09:03,414
And what you do is you try and channel that energy

183
00:09:03,474 --> 00:09:05,275
of them wanting to throw their money at you.

184
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:06,776
And you've got to channel it,

185
00:09:06,836 --> 00:09:08,037
since you don't have a game out yet,

186
00:09:08,057 --> 00:09:09,738
to something productive.

187
00:09:10,158 --> 00:09:12,039
And usually what you do is you get them to follow you

188
00:09:12,139 --> 00:09:13,080
on a different platform.

189
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,302
In this case, like a follow on the Twitter.

190
00:09:17,436 --> 00:09:20,537
And the way you do that is through a call to action.

191
00:09:21,357 --> 00:09:23,518
Always have a call to action.

192
00:09:23,538 --> 00:09:27,359
A call to action is just a very clear bit of text

193
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,940
that tells somebody exactly what to do next.

194
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:30,721
That's it.

195
00:09:31,001 --> 00:09:34,022
Like, it's that simple, but so many people forget to do it.

196
00:09:34,042 --> 00:09:34,702
Let me show you.

197
00:09:35,682 --> 00:09:38,523
Like these, like and subscribe, ring that bell,

198
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:39,244
follow me on Twitter.

199
00:09:39,524 --> 00:09:40,804
All those are calls to action,

200
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:43,485
and you need to do them to move them off of Reddit

201
00:09:43,925 --> 00:09:45,066
and onto your next platform.

202
00:09:45,926 --> 00:09:46,026
So.

203
00:09:46,717 --> 00:09:50,359
you've got to be prepared with what your call to action is with whatever you post,

204
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:53,640
because you don't know what's going to go viral. And if you miss the opportunity,

205
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:57,942
that energy that people have that are excited about you is going to fade really fast. And

206
00:09:57,962 --> 00:10:02,484
then you missed out on an opportunity to convert people from that excitement to actually following

207
00:10:02,524 --> 00:10:08,547
you. I know people say, oh, it's just visibility. This is good. Visibility doesn't count. It's a

208
00:10:08,627 --> 00:10:10,388
real waste if you don't capture that energy.

209
00:10:11,617 --> 00:10:16,059
Okay, so like I was saying, those call to actions are what take people from Reddit to

210
00:10:16,099 --> 00:10:18,700
Twitter, Twitter to Steam, Steam to buying.

211
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:22,401
You need call to actions and it's kind of the mortar between all these bricks.

212
00:10:23,761 --> 00:10:26,182
Okay, I cannot emphasize this enough.

213
00:10:26,342 --> 00:10:32,684
I know I'm going to say this a lot, but always have a call to action.

214
00:10:34,265 --> 00:10:36,266
Okay, so let me show you how to build the funnel.

215
00:10:36,306 --> 00:10:37,966
This is actually where you're going to get your strategy.

216
00:10:39,489 --> 00:10:41,230
There's so many social media platforms.

217
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,271
There's a new one every week.

218
00:10:42,631 --> 00:10:45,833
If you were to use all of them and to get people to follow you

219
00:10:45,873 --> 00:10:47,915
in all of them, and you had all the things,

220
00:10:48,055 --> 00:10:49,636
you would go absolutely nuts.

221
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:50,557
It's impossible.

222
00:10:50,657 --> 00:10:51,297
You can't do it.

223
00:10:52,498 --> 00:10:54,160
Even if you could be on all the platforms,

224
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,701
your audience wouldn't know what to do.

225
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:57,642
There'd be call to actions all over the place.

226
00:10:57,662 --> 00:10:59,324
Follow me on this, then not follow me on this.

227
00:10:59,584 --> 00:11:00,224
It's impossible.

228
00:11:01,045 --> 00:11:03,807
But understanding the funnel helps you rationalize this stuff.

229
00:11:03,847 --> 00:11:05,828
And let me show you how it actually makes more sense

230
00:11:05,908 --> 00:11:06,669
once you see it in the funnel.

231
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:11,192
Now, there are platforms that are very good at the top of the funnel, which is awareness.

232
00:11:11,332 --> 00:11:15,995
It's going from people who don't know you exist to actually at least having a concept

233
00:11:16,035 --> 00:11:16,435
of your game.

234
00:11:16,755 --> 00:11:21,878
And those platforms are like Reddit, Twitter, Imgur, Twitch, if like a big Twitch streamer

235
00:11:21,898 --> 00:11:23,219
follows you, or Facebook.

236
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:28,181
All these are great for when somebody doesn't know you to kind of know, just to be aware

237
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:28,441
of you.

238
00:11:28,782 --> 00:11:29,922
That's when you can go viral.

239
00:11:29,962 --> 00:11:32,383
Note, all of these are going viral platforms.

240
00:11:33,135 --> 00:11:37,416
The problem with these are they're ironically not very good at mid to low funnel, where

241
00:11:37,436 --> 00:11:41,098
you're converting somebody who's like aware of you and they like you and they want to

242
00:11:41,178 --> 00:11:42,779
like take that action to go by.

243
00:11:43,239 --> 00:11:46,360
All of these platforms are actually pretty terrible at getting people to act.

244
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,781
So let me show you what's next.

245
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:53,203
In the middle of the funnel, which is interest and desire, those kind of mid funnel activities,

246
00:11:53,563 --> 00:11:58,305
the good platforms are like Discord, email marketing, my favorite, and sometimes Twitter.

247
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:01,982
Those are platforms where you really get to build a community.

248
00:12:02,262 --> 00:12:07,924
People follow you, you follow them back, you converse with them daily, come back and forth,

249
00:12:07,964 --> 00:12:08,904
and there's a real back and forth.

250
00:12:09,164 --> 00:12:14,405
Those platforms don't go viral very often, but they're really good at making people fall

251
00:12:14,425 --> 00:12:15,106
in love with you.

252
00:12:15,326 --> 00:12:16,926
That's the mid funnel right there.

253
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:20,467
The reason I say Twitter is not very good, I'll show you in a little bit, but people

254
00:12:20,527 --> 00:12:22,668
don't actually act very often when they use Twitter.

255
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:27,064
And then the bottom of the funnel, which is action, is just the storefront.

256
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:28,185
It's wherever your game is.

257
00:12:28,545 --> 00:12:29,466
It might be Steam.

258
00:12:29,686 --> 00:12:32,949
It could be Epic's game store, whatever it is, that's where people take action.

259
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:36,513
So in this case, this is what my funnel is for my games.

260
00:12:36,793 --> 00:12:38,214
Not everybody's funnel is going to look the same.

261
00:12:38,715 --> 00:12:39,355
I like Imgur.

262
00:12:39,435 --> 00:12:40,636
I figured that platform out.

263
00:12:40,757 --> 00:12:41,697
So I put that at the top.

264
00:12:41,758 --> 00:12:42,698
That's my top of the funnel.

265
00:12:43,233 --> 00:12:46,775
My mid funnel is email marketing because I love email marketing and my games are on Steam.

266
00:12:46,795 --> 00:12:48,736
So that's my action level of the funnel.

267
00:12:49,176 --> 00:12:50,657
This is my marketing strategy.

268
00:12:50,997 --> 00:12:54,378
Everybody else is going to be different based on what they like and what's their favorite platform.

269
00:12:54,739 --> 00:12:55,619
You should construct your own.

270
00:12:55,699 --> 00:12:59,241
Don't just copy this because it's dependent on what your game is and what you like to use.

271
00:13:00,742 --> 00:13:02,322
So that's your marketing plan.

272
00:13:02,402 --> 00:13:04,303
Just build your funnel based on what you like

273
00:13:04,623 --> 00:13:06,985
and what kind of platform fits best with your type of game.

274
00:13:07,425 --> 00:13:08,265
So what do you do next?

275
00:13:09,326 --> 00:13:10,707
You just yell, buy my game Adam.

276
00:13:10,767 --> 00:13:11,167
It's easy.

277
00:13:11,507 --> 00:13:11,947
Don't, no.

278
00:13:12,661 --> 00:13:18,265
Don't do that. Don't please don't do that. What you got to do is really have a strategy for how you're gonna communicate now

279
00:13:18,305 --> 00:13:24,029
Let me show you what you're gonna say to the levels of the funnel. Okay, there's three parts to talking to your funnel

280
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:27,332
Okay, first you got to understand who your audience is. This is a big one

281
00:13:27,612 --> 00:13:30,755
Then you got to build that relationship with them. That's that mid funnel activity

282
00:13:30,775 --> 00:13:32,776
I was talking about and then you got to tell them what to do

283
00:13:34,177 --> 00:13:36,339
So let's talk about number one understanding your audience

284
00:13:38,204 --> 00:13:39,625
Not enough people do this.

285
00:13:39,645 --> 00:13:40,606
This is the first step.

286
00:13:40,706 --> 00:13:43,969
If I get hired as a consultant for some game company,

287
00:13:44,209 --> 00:13:46,992
the very first thing I do is actually just observe

288
00:13:47,012 --> 00:13:49,233
the audience that is predisposed to like that game.

289
00:13:49,574 --> 00:13:51,435
I try and figure out who their buyers are

290
00:13:51,816 --> 00:13:54,598
and really what kind of things that customer might like.

291
00:13:55,038 --> 00:13:57,821
So you just gotta put on your anthropologist hat

292
00:13:57,861 --> 00:13:59,202
and go off and observe the user.

293
00:13:59,302 --> 00:14:00,543
Let me show you what I'm talking about here.

294
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:05,407
The reason you do that is because if you can state the problem better than they can, they're

295
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:05,968
going to trust you.

296
00:14:06,008 --> 00:14:09,368
This is an old marketing saw that people always talk about.

297
00:14:10,409 --> 00:14:12,749
If you can tell them what their problem is, they're going to love you.

298
00:14:13,089 --> 00:14:13,969
For example, watch this.

299
00:14:14,109 --> 00:14:16,330
This is those old cheesy infomercials.

300
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:20,631
The first parts are always those black and white, where people are tripping and clumsily

301
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,031
doing things.

302
00:14:21,051 --> 00:14:25,012
I'm not saying we literally need to do that, but the purpose of those is to state a problem

303
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:25,792
they know you have.

304
00:14:26,212 --> 00:14:29,373
I don't know what this guy with the oh no is, but hopefully they just, I think they

305
00:14:29,393 --> 00:14:31,333
like drop their soap or hopefully that's what it is.

306
00:14:32,334 --> 00:14:34,216
So, they're stating common problems that people have.

307
00:14:34,436 --> 00:14:38,140
They just ramp it up to 11 because everybody who's watching them is either stoned or drunk.

308
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,541
That's why they have to do it that way.

309
00:14:39,821 --> 00:14:43,304
But you don't have to, but you do have to understand the problems that your audience

310
00:14:43,364 --> 00:14:43,845
is having.

311
00:14:44,445 --> 00:14:47,929
And you might be saying, I'm in the video game industry, what problems?

312
00:14:48,609 --> 00:14:49,470
Video games are worthless.

313
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:52,233
You obviously haven't been reading Steam reviews.

314
00:14:52,273 --> 00:14:54,334
People have problems all the time with video games.

315
00:14:55,496 --> 00:14:57,037
Just go in and read the reviews.

316
00:14:57,057 --> 00:14:57,778
Let me show you what I mean.

317
00:14:57,798 --> 00:14:57,978
Thank you.

318
00:14:59,193 --> 00:15:02,155
If you read enough negative reviews, you're going to see some recurring themes like,

319
00:15:02,255 --> 00:15:06,517
can't change the controls, or I can't change the resolution.

320
00:15:06,677 --> 00:15:09,359
People have real problems with video games that are legitimate problems.

321
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:11,660
So this is what I suggest to do.

322
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,662
Identify who your audience is, and don't just say gamers, that doesn't count.

323
00:15:16,042 --> 00:15:17,243
It's got to be very specific.

324
00:15:18,196 --> 00:15:20,477
I've studied Steam buyers very carefully.

325
00:15:20,798 --> 00:15:25,301
I actually gave a talk on this GDC, check the stream, I don't know if it's down below

326
00:15:25,461 --> 00:15:26,362
on the YouTube.

327
00:15:26,662 --> 00:15:29,004
It's called Empathizing with Steam, How Buyers See Your Game.

328
00:15:29,464 --> 00:15:33,767
But I did a whole study on how people buy games on Steam, and it turns out people buy

329
00:15:33,988 --> 00:15:35,549
very specific genres.

330
00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:40,593
They don't buy a whole bunch of genres, they stick to maybe three, four at the top.

331
00:15:41,281 --> 00:15:43,942
So what you can use is, you can use this to your advantage.

332
00:15:44,462 --> 00:15:48,463
Basically what you do is you identify your game genre, be very specific about

333
00:15:48,503 --> 00:15:51,923
what genre your game is in, and look at the number one game that is

334
00:15:51,983 --> 00:15:55,344
similar to your genre, the big title. Like if I'm making a roguelike,

335
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:58,645
I know it's probably going to be Dead Cells or it's going to be

336
00:15:59,365 --> 00:16:02,866
Rogue Legacy, so go study that game and identify

337
00:16:02,886 --> 00:16:05,606
a medium seller, maybe one that's not very famous,

338
00:16:06,207 --> 00:16:09,147
kind of a mid-level game that didn't sell as well.

339
00:16:10,033 --> 00:16:12,114
And then go read reviews for those two games.

340
00:16:12,414 --> 00:16:15,576
And just see the common themes that show up over and over again.

341
00:16:15,596 --> 00:16:19,818
And look at the negative reviews and see what they say over and over again.

342
00:16:20,658 --> 00:16:23,259
And basically find some reviewers who seem nice.

343
00:16:23,359 --> 00:16:24,420
Don't go for the psychopaths.

344
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,962
Don't go finding reviewers who have that weird racist frog.

345
00:16:28,302 --> 00:16:28,802
Don't do that.

346
00:16:29,242 --> 00:16:31,964
Just find a nice reviewer and then message them.

347
00:16:32,144 --> 00:16:33,605
And then talk to them about video games.

348
00:16:33,645 --> 00:16:35,245
They're actually going to be very nice about it.

349
00:16:35,586 --> 00:16:38,647
It's going to be awkward, but again, we have a fun job.

350
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,671
It's one of the pains we have to go through, right?

351
00:16:41,231 --> 00:16:42,692
Okay, so here's how to talk to your audience.

352
00:16:43,152 --> 00:16:44,853
Just say what you're trying to do

353
00:16:45,453 --> 00:16:49,335
and don't ask them if they like your idea.

354
00:16:49,516 --> 00:16:50,336
That's not gonna work.

355
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:52,457
You have to be very cautious about what you say

356
00:16:52,497 --> 00:16:53,618
so you don't taint their opinion.

357
00:16:54,058 --> 00:16:55,019
Don't ask what they want.

358
00:16:55,359 --> 00:16:57,400
Instead, ask what they've done in the past.

359
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,541
People are very honest about what they did in the past

360
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:02,303
and they're less honest about what they want to do

361
00:17:02,423 --> 00:17:03,984
because they're gonna lie to you to make you happy.

362
00:17:04,144 --> 00:17:05,545
That's just because people are nice.

363
00:17:07,029 --> 00:17:09,691
And also, so these are some common questions

364
00:17:09,711 --> 00:17:10,492
that I like to ask.

365
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:12,313
Like, if I'm making a co-op game, say, hey,

366
00:17:12,353 --> 00:17:13,634
what was the last co-op game you played?

367
00:17:13,774 --> 00:17:15,135
And then that's going to be a springboard where

368
00:17:15,155 --> 00:17:16,256
they can explain more and more.

369
00:17:17,577 --> 00:17:19,018
And write down everything they say,

370
00:17:19,258 --> 00:17:20,839
because you're going to be compiling all these notes.

371
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:22,240
What I do is I make a spreadsheet,

372
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:25,602
and I basically split it into sections.

373
00:17:25,642 --> 00:17:26,823
Like, what do they hate about a game,

374
00:17:27,243 --> 00:17:29,065
and what do they love about that game genre?

375
00:17:29,485 --> 00:17:31,746
And all these things are just going to be used later on.

376
00:17:31,786 --> 00:17:32,367
I'll show you how.

377
00:17:33,608 --> 00:17:35,049
So this is where you're going to use it.

378
00:17:35,169 --> 00:17:36,350
It's when you build that relationship.

379
00:17:38,427 --> 00:17:42,029
The important thing here is your copy is not about your product, it's about a feeling.

380
00:17:42,309 --> 00:17:42,870
So let me show you.

381
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:45,051
Nike, they sell sports equipment, right?

382
00:17:45,491 --> 00:17:48,693
But when you look at this, what sports equipment are they selling here?

383
00:17:48,913 --> 00:17:49,513
I don't even know.

384
00:17:49,593 --> 00:17:51,134
They don't even talk about features or anything.

385
00:17:51,455 --> 00:17:54,416
What they're trying to sell is that feeling, and that's what your copy is trying to do.

386
00:17:54,796 --> 00:17:59,439
You're not listing features and whether it's a green or a yellow or how good your features

387
00:17:59,559 --> 00:17:59,659
are.

388
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,581
What you're really doing is you're talking about the benefits.

389
00:18:03,163 --> 00:18:05,665
And this is a very common thing in copywriting.

390
00:18:05,945 --> 00:18:07,226
What you gotta do is break things down.

391
00:18:07,427 --> 00:18:08,708
And you don't wanna list features.

392
00:18:08,768 --> 00:18:11,270
Like, don't say, my game has 50 side quests.

393
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,132
Try and turn that around and think of how it's a benefit.

394
00:18:14,192 --> 00:18:17,335
For example, a benefit is every character has a backstory.

395
00:18:17,575 --> 00:18:18,876
You choose which one to explore.

396
00:18:19,277 --> 00:18:20,898
That's turning a feature into a benefit.

397
00:18:21,218 --> 00:18:22,740
And that's what people are gonna respond to.

398
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,382
Similarly, maybe your feature is dual wielding.

399
00:18:25,802 --> 00:18:27,423
Turn that into a benefit and say,

400
00:18:27,864 --> 00:18:30,366
oh, you get to improvise unique weapon combos

401
00:18:30,386 --> 00:18:31,707
to defeat enemies your way.

402
00:18:32,235 --> 00:18:35,580
really people are going to respond better to that feeling that you give them,

403
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,025
rather than that some dumb bullet point feature that you've got.

404
00:18:39,345 --> 00:18:40,767
So that's how you really connect with people.

405
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:45,153
And you might be wondering, well, what kind of features do they like?

406
00:18:45,373 --> 00:18:46,635
Well, that's where your research did.

407
00:18:47,618 --> 00:18:51,800
So one of the things is people I see this all the time, they kind of write these stories that are

408
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,843
focused on them as marketers. So for example, I know you went to PAX East and it was a great trip

409
00:18:57,063 --> 00:19:00,766
and you had a lot of fun and you learned a lot of stuff, but your audience doesn't care about that.

410
00:19:00,846 --> 00:19:05,628
It's like watching somebody else's vacation. So don't write about how you visited PAX East.

411
00:19:06,129 --> 00:19:10,311
Talk about stuff that your community cares about. They actually care about your game more than they

412
00:19:10,351 --> 00:19:15,194
care about what you did to market your game. So be cognizant from their standpoint.

413
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:18,071
So here's some specific tips on how to format your writing.

414
00:19:19,132 --> 00:19:22,175
OK, headlines, titles, these are very difficult to write.

415
00:19:22,615 --> 00:19:23,716
They take a lot of time.

416
00:19:24,016 --> 00:19:24,937
So let me give you some tips.

417
00:19:26,538 --> 00:19:27,579
Look at your list that you built,

418
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:29,760
the pros and the cons that people have with your game,

419
00:19:30,081 --> 00:19:31,301
and turn those into headlines.

420
00:19:31,722 --> 00:19:33,703
So for instance, I'm making a Metroidvania game.

421
00:19:34,284 --> 00:19:36,525
A lot of people love to look at those maps.

422
00:19:36,846 --> 00:19:40,028
The maps are a very important key aspect of Metroidvanias.

423
00:19:40,428 --> 00:19:41,729
So I turn that into a headline.

424
00:19:41,989 --> 00:19:44,692
Five ways we made the Metroidvania map suck less.

425
00:19:45,031 --> 00:19:47,753
When I read a lot of reviews, people are always complaining about the maps.

426
00:19:48,073 --> 00:19:50,234
So I'm going to write something that's relevant to what they care

427
00:19:50,254 --> 00:19:51,295
about, which are the maps.

428
00:19:52,836 --> 00:19:55,177
The next part is really building a swipe file.

429
00:19:55,718 --> 00:19:59,560
Now a swipe file is just a list of cool headlines that you've seen in the past.

430
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,123
And every good marketer has their own swipe file because it's sometimes you

431
00:20:03,163 --> 00:20:06,385
get writer's block and you need to figure out, you need some inspiration for a

432
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:06,705
headline.

433
00:20:07,025 --> 00:20:08,746
So I build a swipe file that I have.

434
00:20:09,186 --> 00:20:11,388
Now you probably haven't been doing this long, so you don't have one.

435
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:16,871
What I recommend is go to YouTube, look at your history on YouTube, and all those videos

436
00:20:16,891 --> 00:20:21,072
that you viewed probably have a pretty good headline because they caused you to click

437
00:20:21,172 --> 00:20:21,372
on it.

438
00:20:21,792 --> 00:20:22,592
Same thing with email.

439
00:20:22,632 --> 00:20:27,814
Go to your Promotions tab and then look at all your Gmail inbox to see if there's any

440
00:20:27,934 --> 00:20:28,754
emails that you read.

441
00:20:29,074 --> 00:20:31,475
And I bet that title has a real catchy headline.

442
00:20:31,755 --> 00:20:33,515
So look for that for inspiration.

443
00:20:34,102 --> 00:20:35,843
And also don't be afraid to just Google for it.

444
00:20:35,883 --> 00:20:37,543
Just search great email subject headlines.

445
00:20:38,063 --> 00:20:39,384
All great copywriters do it.

446
00:20:39,684 --> 00:20:40,624
It's not a crime.

447
00:20:40,944 --> 00:20:42,585
It's not like school where you can't copy.

448
00:20:42,605 --> 00:20:45,325
I mean, make it your own, but really understand

449
00:20:45,926 --> 00:20:49,026
it's okay to be inspired by other marketers.

450
00:20:50,327 --> 00:20:51,807
Now, we can't talk about headlines

451
00:20:52,147 --> 00:20:53,308
without talking about clickbait.

452
00:20:53,608 --> 00:20:55,128
It's a very hot topic on the internet.

453
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:57,849
It causes a lot of angst among people.

454
00:20:58,309 --> 00:20:58,409
And

455
00:20:59,172 --> 00:21:02,218
I feel like the internet and as we as indie marketers,

456
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:04,101
we're a little too afraid of clickbait.

457
00:21:04,782 --> 00:21:07,607
We're so afraid of being called out for clickbait

458
00:21:07,847 --> 00:21:10,392
that we write these super bland headlines

459
00:21:10,472 --> 00:21:12,575
like studio newsletter number six.

460
00:21:13,323 --> 00:21:14,503
Like, that is super boring.

461
00:21:14,723 --> 00:21:15,863
Nobody's gonna open that email.

462
00:21:16,203 --> 00:21:18,424
I didn't read studio newsletter number five,

463
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:21,804
so I'm hell not gonna read number five or number six.

464
00:21:22,145 --> 00:21:24,305
So don't write a boring headline like that.

465
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:28,046
Also, new dev blog update, that's also a boring headline.

466
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:28,986
Don't do those sort of things.

467
00:21:29,606 --> 00:21:32,447
Instead, do something that's a little bit dramatic.

468
00:21:32,567 --> 00:21:36,267
It's okay to be dramatic as long as you're being honest.

469
00:21:36,647 --> 00:21:38,628
Clickbait is bad when people feel tripped.

470
00:21:38,828 --> 00:21:39,968
Here's an example, here's an example.

471
00:21:40,348 --> 00:21:42,348
If you wrote a headline that says, I'm quitting,

472
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:46,140
Dairy? People are going to call that off for clickbait, and they should.

473
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,501
That's lying to people.

474
00:21:48,621 --> 00:21:51,763
An honest clickbait headline actually, though, which is not clickbait, is,

475
00:21:52,003 --> 00:21:52,503
I'm quitting.

476
00:21:53,303 --> 00:21:57,445
And then I wrote a whole blog post about how I ended up quitting my

477
00:21:57,465 --> 00:22:00,146
corporate job so that I could go market video games professionally,

478
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:00,867
which is what I did.

479
00:22:01,349 --> 00:22:04,270
And I wrote a whole Imgur post, it made it to the front page of Imgur.

480
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:05,891
And nobody called me out for clickbait.

481
00:22:06,151 --> 00:22:08,392
It was an honest title and I told a dramatic story.

482
00:22:08,832 --> 00:22:11,993
So don't be afraid of dramatic headlines if they're honest.

483
00:22:12,313 --> 00:22:15,294
You've got to be honest with your audience, but you also have to be interesting.

484
00:22:17,515 --> 00:22:19,036
So make them pay off.

485
00:22:20,056 --> 00:22:21,497
All right, so how about the body text?

486
00:22:21,597 --> 00:22:23,077
They've gotten the headline, they clicked it.

487
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:26,762
It's really scary for that middle big open block.

488
00:22:27,162 --> 00:22:29,505
So let me show you how you should and shouldn't write.

489
00:22:29,585 --> 00:22:31,988
So a giant open blank space like that

490
00:22:32,109 --> 00:22:33,310
is very intimidating.

491
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,333
Nobody's gonna read all that much text.

492
00:22:36,004 --> 00:22:37,125
Instead, you got to break it up.

493
00:22:37,506 --> 00:22:38,787
Let me show you how people actually read.

494
00:22:39,088 --> 00:22:40,349
They skim along the headlines.

495
00:22:40,389 --> 00:22:41,851
So they're going to be the first headline,

496
00:22:41,871 --> 00:22:43,392
then the second one, then the third line.

497
00:22:43,633 --> 00:22:45,394
They like big chunks to their text,

498
00:22:45,755 --> 00:22:47,216
like chunking it up into subheads.

499
00:22:47,757 --> 00:22:49,078
And then what they do is they go to the bottom

500
00:22:49,098 --> 00:22:50,400
because they look for the call to action

501
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,662
because they want to see what's in it for them.

502
00:22:52,702 --> 00:22:54,084
They're like, what are you here for, buddy?

503
00:22:54,344 --> 00:22:55,405
What are you going to charge me?

504
00:22:55,755 --> 00:22:56,275
They look at that.

505
00:22:56,576 --> 00:22:57,696
Then once they get to the bottom,

506
00:22:57,856 --> 00:22:59,756
they bounce back up and they jump ahead

507
00:22:59,816 --> 00:23:01,277
to the section that they actually like.

508
00:23:01,357 --> 00:23:02,797
So if they're interested in heading two,

509
00:23:03,097 --> 00:23:04,297
they're gonna skip the heading two.

510
00:23:04,737 --> 00:23:07,058
And then they'll also kind of skim through bullet points.

511
00:23:07,578 --> 00:23:10,359
So that combination of subheads and bullet points,

512
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:11,819
you gotta use that to your advantage.

513
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:12,399
Let me show you.

514
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,200
When people are reading those headlines,

515
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,100
because they skip them,

516
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,441
you gotta kind of construct them like they're one sentence.

517
00:23:19,501 --> 00:23:20,301
Let me show you how.

518
00:23:21,281 --> 00:23:25,002
This is for a fictional game like Breath of the Wild.

519
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:28,199
Explore an open world, find secret ingredients,

520
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:29,799
and craft destructible potions.

521
00:23:30,199 --> 00:23:32,160
Notice how that almost reads like a sentence,

522
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,480
but those are headlines.

523
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:36,001
And then what I do is I'd write expanded text

524
00:23:36,121 --> 00:23:37,261
under each one of those headlines

525
00:23:37,501 --> 00:23:39,381
that describe that open world

526
00:23:39,521 --> 00:23:40,902
or what those ingredients are,

527
00:23:40,962 --> 00:23:42,822
because I know people are skipping down the headlines.

528
00:23:44,562 --> 00:23:46,403
And this is where you kind of get your text,

529
00:23:46,743 --> 00:23:49,143
is by, remember that white list that we did

530
00:23:49,183 --> 00:23:50,824
where we had the red and the green

531
00:23:50,884 --> 00:23:51,944
of what they like and what they don't?

532
00:23:52,287 --> 00:23:54,348
Grab those and turn those into headlines.

533
00:23:54,789 --> 00:23:56,250
Because what you want to do is you

534
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:58,192
want to turn that into what the readers are saying.

535
00:23:58,412 --> 00:23:59,353
They're going to read that and they're

536
00:23:59,373 --> 00:24:02,015
say, how do you know that I love Metroidvania maps so much?

537
00:24:02,536 --> 00:24:04,717
It's like you've watched them before.

538
00:24:04,797 --> 00:24:05,378
Because you have.

539
00:24:05,398 --> 00:24:07,540
You interviewed their comrades, people

540
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,581
who are very similar to them.

541
00:24:08,941 --> 00:24:10,843
You really know them, and then they're going to trust you.

542
00:24:12,244 --> 00:24:13,425
OK, so you got the body text.

543
00:24:13,865 --> 00:24:14,946
Now you got to tell them what to do.

544
00:24:15,627 --> 00:24:20,251
Also known as a call to action.

545
00:24:20,704 --> 00:24:22,746
We always have to have a call to action.

546
00:24:22,766 --> 00:24:24,427
Now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna show you

547
00:24:24,487 --> 00:24:26,328
how to write a good call to action.

548
00:24:26,708 --> 00:24:27,769
Now remember, a call to action

549
00:24:28,009 --> 00:24:29,190
jumps people between the funnel.

550
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:31,452
It gets them off of Reddit and onto Twitter.

551
00:24:31,652 --> 00:24:33,033
It's really hard to move people

552
00:24:33,073 --> 00:24:34,154
from one platform to another,

553
00:24:34,414 --> 00:24:35,155
and I'm gonna show you how.

554
00:24:36,583 --> 00:24:39,505
Okay, we're going to do a live example, almost like English class here.

555
00:24:40,026 --> 00:24:44,308
So this is a typical indie marketing headline that I see or a call to action that I see.

556
00:24:44,569 --> 00:24:45,169
Something like this.

557
00:24:45,549 --> 00:24:46,470
Sorry to bother you.

558
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:47,591
I know you're busy.

559
00:24:48,331 --> 00:24:51,373
But my little tiny stupid game came out a few days ago.

560
00:24:51,753 --> 00:24:55,136
Could you just take a look and review help, please?

561
00:24:55,496 --> 00:24:56,917
This is a terrible CTA.

562
00:24:57,577 --> 00:24:58,958
Don't do anything like this.

563
00:24:59,038 --> 00:24:59,999
Let's make this better.

564
00:25:00,019 --> 00:25:01,159
I'm going to show you how.

565
00:25:01,179 --> 00:25:03,681
Okay, get rid of weak sauce apologies.

566
00:25:03,901 --> 00:25:04,442
Don't do that.

567
00:25:04,842 --> 00:25:06,323
This is what I don't want you guys to do.

568
00:25:06,635 --> 00:25:08,376
I want you to be very honest with your game

569
00:25:08,596 --> 00:25:09,537
and be confident about it.

570
00:25:09,597 --> 00:25:10,358
Your game's awesome.

571
00:25:10,738 --> 00:25:11,959
So let's just cut that stuff out.

572
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:13,580
My game came out a few days ago,

573
00:25:13,821 --> 00:25:15,482
be sure to take a look and reviews help.

574
00:25:15,862 --> 00:25:17,043
Okay, let's improve this.

575
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:18,204
This is good, but not great.

576
00:25:19,105 --> 00:25:20,866
You should only have one call to action.

577
00:25:21,467 --> 00:25:22,488
People aren't gonna do everything,

578
00:25:22,508 --> 00:25:23,528
they're gonna do one thing.

579
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:25,830
So let's strip this down to one.

580
00:25:26,331 --> 00:25:28,392
Let's just say, my game came out a few days ago

581
00:25:28,713 --> 00:25:30,634
and reviews help, and then you provide a link.

582
00:25:31,415 --> 00:25:32,836
Better, but let me show you the next part.

583
00:25:33,897 --> 00:25:35,078
Don't use passive voice.

584
00:25:35,298 --> 00:25:38,320
Be very verb focused and tell them exactly what to do.

585
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,381
So let's improve that.

586
00:25:40,442 --> 00:25:41,823
My game came out a few days ago.

587
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:43,064
Please review it.

588
00:25:43,364 --> 00:25:44,244
And then you provide that link.

589
00:25:44,925 --> 00:25:45,705
Better, better.

590
00:25:46,266 --> 00:25:47,166
But see this link?

591
00:25:47,967 --> 00:25:50,309
You've got to be very specific with what you want them to do.

592
00:25:50,769 --> 00:25:54,071
I always click the link whenever I have a call to action.

593
00:25:54,331 --> 00:25:55,092
Let me show you why.

594
00:25:57,253 --> 00:25:58,694
So this is Valve's official Twitter.

595
00:25:59,675 --> 00:26:01,576
And they had a post about City 17.

596
00:26:03,123 --> 00:26:07,224
And their call to action was follow the upcoming release

597
00:26:07,564 --> 00:26:12,685
of Half-Life Alyx.

598
00:26:12,765 --> 00:26:15,446
And so what they did was they just provided a link.

599
00:26:15,926 --> 00:26:18,426
Now, to be honest, this is a pretty good call to action.

600
00:26:19,246 --> 00:26:20,986
So I clicked this link, this one right here,

601
00:26:21,006 --> 00:26:21,847
because I'm on Steam.

602
00:26:21,907 --> 00:26:23,207
So I want to follow them because I'm

603
00:26:23,287 --> 00:26:24,367
really excited for that game.

604
00:26:24,727 --> 00:26:27,468
So I click that link, and it takes it to this page.

605
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:29,428
Now, look closely.

606
00:26:29,848 --> 00:26:32,328
There's not a single button on here that says Follow.

607
00:26:33,145 --> 00:26:36,287
They dump me to a page that doesn't have the call to action that they told me to do.

608
00:26:36,767 --> 00:26:39,488
To actually follow this page, here's what I got to do.

609
00:26:39,888 --> 00:26:42,729
I got to go over here to the store page button, click that button,

610
00:26:43,149 --> 00:26:45,690
then I'm on the store page, then I got to scroll down,

611
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:48,871
and then right there, there's the follow button.

612
00:26:49,412 --> 00:26:54,613
That's three to four extra steps that I would have had to take in if I'd followed their link.

613
00:26:55,374 --> 00:26:56,254
Nobody is going to do that.

614
00:26:56,574 --> 00:27:01,056
I did that only because I'm studying them and trying to understand how copywriting works.

615
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:02,591
So don't do that.

616
00:27:02,791 --> 00:27:03,491
Nobody's gonna do that.

617
00:27:03,511 --> 00:27:04,732
You're gonna drop off on your audience.

618
00:27:05,272 --> 00:27:07,294
What you gotta do is be very specific

619
00:27:07,534 --> 00:27:09,755
and dump them on the correct link

620
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:12,797
so that they can do just one simple action to do it.

621
00:27:13,177 --> 00:27:15,118
So always test your links to see where it goes

622
00:27:15,378 --> 00:27:16,559
and write your copy based on this.

623
00:27:16,859 --> 00:27:18,840
So for example, if I wanted to ask them to do a review,

624
00:27:19,851 --> 00:27:20,512
Say something like this,

625
00:27:20,852 --> 00:27:23,014
my game came out a few days ago, please review it.

626
00:27:23,254 --> 00:27:25,316
Click the following link, scroll down to reviews,

627
00:27:25,596 --> 00:27:27,118
and write one thing that you liked about my game

628
00:27:27,218 --> 00:27:28,979
and one thing you didn't, and then provide the link.

629
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,701
You've got to be dead specific.

630
00:27:30,881 --> 00:27:33,083
I know it sounds obvious, but it's not.

631
00:27:33,303 --> 00:27:34,224
You have to do this.

632
00:27:34,264 --> 00:27:36,526
You have to be very specific with what you want people to do

633
00:27:36,866 --> 00:27:38,068
because they've got busy lives.

634
00:27:38,108 --> 00:27:39,329
They're probably at the checkout aisle

635
00:27:39,369 --> 00:27:40,550
at the grocery store reading this.

636
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:41,711
So be specific.

637
00:27:42,586 --> 00:27:44,888
The other thing you've got to do is add a little pathos to it.

638
00:27:45,188 --> 00:27:46,229
I like to tell them why.

639
00:27:46,669 --> 00:27:49,651
You've played my game and I appreciate you and I need your help with one thing.

640
00:27:49,951 --> 00:27:50,612
Please review it.

641
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:53,034
Click the following link, scroll down to the review section,

642
00:27:53,114 --> 00:27:55,115
write one thing you like about my game and one thing you didn't.

643
00:27:55,555 --> 00:27:56,276
And provide the link.

644
00:27:57,297 --> 00:27:57,857
Pretty good, right?

645
00:27:59,019 --> 00:28:00,660
So finally, add a cool button.

646
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,640
And here's why.

647
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,621
Remember how I told you people skim at the front?

648
00:28:04,121 --> 00:28:05,622
If your link is hidden in your text,

649
00:28:05,802 --> 00:28:06,582
they're not gonna see it.

650
00:28:06,902 --> 00:28:10,084
So put a gigantic button with a nice verb on there.

651
00:28:10,384 --> 00:28:11,645
Review my game.

652
00:28:11,885 --> 00:28:14,566
I always put a review first, a verb first.

653
00:28:15,106 --> 00:28:16,687
It just gives it that extra punch

654
00:28:16,727 --> 00:28:17,587
so that people know what to do.

655
00:28:17,847 --> 00:28:19,488
So even if they skim all that text,

656
00:28:19,528 --> 00:28:21,169
which I know is a lot of text,

657
00:28:21,629 --> 00:28:23,049
they're gonna see that review my game

658
00:28:23,069 --> 00:28:25,110
and they're gonna click it and know exactly what to do.

659
00:28:26,759 --> 00:28:29,741
That's it. That's what we had to do to get a good call to action.

660
00:28:31,682 --> 00:28:36,246
Always have a call to action. Always. All right.

661
00:28:36,786 --> 00:28:39,989
Part four, short tutorial on email marketing. This is my favorite thing.

662
00:28:40,369 --> 00:28:42,771
I love email marketing. It's kind of where my jam,

663
00:28:42,811 --> 00:28:44,573
that's kind of what I help other companies do.

664
00:28:44,813 --> 00:28:47,595
So if you have email marketing problems, I'm here to help. Um,

665
00:28:47,975 --> 00:28:51,338
the reason I like it so much is it's the most effective mid funnel channel known

666
00:28:51,378 --> 00:28:52,559
to humans, AKA.

667
00:28:53,335 --> 00:28:57,259
This nothing gets more clicks than email in the known universe.

668
00:28:57,739 --> 00:28:58,720
And I'm serious about this.

669
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,501
Let me show you why.

670
00:29:00,521 --> 00:29:03,724
Okay, this was a talk William Pugh did just a few days ago, actually,

671
00:29:04,044 --> 00:29:06,086
about his marketing strategies and stuff.

672
00:29:06,366 --> 00:29:09,389
And he said email had a higher conversion rate than Twitter,

673
00:29:09,549 --> 00:29:11,390
Facebook and Instagram put together.

674
00:29:11,771 --> 00:29:14,653
He's the creator of Stanley Parable, and he knows his stuff.

675
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,394
It really works.

676
00:29:17,035 --> 00:29:21,038
And to prove it, I always go out and research other devs who are doing good marketing.

677
00:29:21,358 --> 00:29:22,379
One of them is Forager.

678
00:29:22,419 --> 00:29:22,720
It's a...

679
00:29:23,322 --> 00:29:27,124
run by a really great company that have really good marketing and they were really kind to

680
00:29:27,184 --> 00:29:28,124
share their data with me.

681
00:29:28,184 --> 00:29:29,985
So if you haven't, pick up a copy of Forager.

682
00:29:30,025 --> 00:29:30,565
It's worth it.

683
00:29:30,645 --> 00:29:31,165
They're worth it.

684
00:29:31,665 --> 00:29:32,286
Okay, come on in.

685
00:29:33,186 --> 00:29:37,708
They've got about 23,000 Twitter followers and 31,000 email subscribers.

686
00:29:38,748 --> 00:29:40,469
And this is impressions.

687
00:29:40,609 --> 00:29:43,830
So they tweet and email at about the same time.

688
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:48,912
I tracked three campaigns that they did, one on October, one in December, and one in January.

689
00:29:49,332 --> 00:29:52,593
Now the blue bar is how many impressions their Twitter got.

690
00:29:52,973 --> 00:29:58,638
And the green or the orange bars are the number of email impressions that they got.

691
00:29:58,898 --> 00:30:01,640
As you can see, Twitter is awesome because it can go viral.

692
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:04,763
Note their January post really did go viral.

693
00:30:05,063 --> 00:30:05,363
Look at that.

694
00:30:05,383 --> 00:30:09,346
They only have 23 subscribers, but 96,000 impressions were resulting from it.

695
00:30:09,767 --> 00:30:10,788
That is awesome.

696
00:30:11,228 --> 00:30:17,153
However, when you look at the number of clicks that actually happened, it's not that many.

697
00:30:17,646 --> 00:30:23,429
Email killed them for the clicks. And as you know, exposure doesn't matter anything. You need them

698
00:30:23,469 --> 00:30:28,132
to convert. You need them to click the links. So even though it feels impressive that you got that

699
00:30:28,172 --> 00:30:35,115
many exposure bucks by actually seeing, getting featured or getting viral, going viral, it didn't

700
00:30:35,156 --> 00:30:42,139
convert. And as you can see, email actually had a 1.5 times more potent than Twitter. If you combine

701
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:42,720
all those.

702
00:30:43,432 --> 00:30:47,674
clicks that happened, add them all together, 1.5 times more for email.

703
00:30:47,814 --> 00:30:50,176
And it can even get more severe of a difference than that.

704
00:30:51,536 --> 00:30:54,498
Okay, so, but if you look at these two graphs, like if you compare them,

705
00:30:54,838 --> 00:30:57,319
you kind of start to see the funnel emerge. Look at this.

706
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,502
Twitter is great for awareness. It's great for exposing your game to somebody who doesn't

707
00:31:03,542 --> 00:31:06,604
know you exist. Just like that viral tweet that happened in January.

708
00:31:07,151 --> 00:31:12,095
That brought that game to a bunch of people who had no idea it existed. But it didn't convert.

709
00:31:12,356 --> 00:31:16,519
That's why I say email is a much better mid funnel and Twitter is a much better top of funnel.

710
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:21,684
I do not recommend concentrating on Twitter as your mid funnel because people just don't

711
00:31:22,785 --> 00:31:26,488
click on Twitter links. They just keep scrolling. So that's why you need something good

712
00:31:26,988 --> 00:31:32,973
mid funnel, like either email or Discord are great mid funnel platforms to use.

713
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:36,871
Okay, the other reason I like email address is because everybody's got one.

714
00:31:37,131 --> 00:31:37,971
You know how I know that?

715
00:31:38,272 --> 00:31:41,993
Because to sign up for those other social media platforms like Twitter or Discord or Twitch,

716
00:31:42,073 --> 00:31:42,534
what do you need?

717
00:31:42,754 --> 00:31:43,514
You need an email address.

718
00:31:43,594 --> 00:31:44,455
Here's their sign up forms.

719
00:31:44,775 --> 00:31:45,135
Guess what?

720
00:31:45,395 --> 00:31:46,616
Top thing, it's always email.

721
00:31:47,476 --> 00:31:50,558
All right, so there's three things that I see people do wrong with email

722
00:31:50,578 --> 00:31:52,258
that I think is really easy to fix.

723
00:31:52,579 --> 00:31:53,859
And these are things how you can improve it.

724
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,100
How to get people to join it,

725
00:31:56,401 --> 00:31:57,701
how to use an autoresponder,

726
00:31:57,981 --> 00:31:59,722
and how to be more personable.

727
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:05,403
So this is a typical email signup that I see on IndieDev's website.

728
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,764
So just basically says, join my mailing list for news and updates.

729
00:32:08,004 --> 00:32:08,585
That's boring.

730
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,186
Nobody's going to join your mailing list.

731
00:32:10,466 --> 00:32:13,088
Or you can improve it greatly by just changing just a few things.

732
00:32:13,548 --> 00:32:15,870
And the way you do it is with something called a lead magnet.

733
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:18,371
And a lead magnet is just a little cookie that you give people

734
00:32:19,052 --> 00:32:21,313
to a little sweetener to have people join.

735
00:32:21,333 --> 00:32:24,476
It's just like that person at the office who has a little candy jar

736
00:32:24,516 --> 00:32:25,777
because they like to make conversation.

737
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:29,439
And it's just a little bit of a little sweetener to get people to talk to you.

738
00:32:31,185 --> 00:32:33,567
And what these little sweeteners are

739
00:32:33,607 --> 00:32:35,349
is little cool gifts that you can get,

740
00:32:35,389 --> 00:32:38,411
like a soundtrack, you can beta access to your game,

741
00:32:38,691 --> 00:32:40,973
a free version of your game, like a demo.

742
00:32:41,594 --> 00:32:43,955
You can do an art book, desktop backgrounds,

743
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:45,717
Steam avatars, anything that's free

744
00:32:46,137 --> 00:32:49,680
and can be easily sent via like a zip or digitally.

745
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:52,542
You don't wanna send off like physical patches or pins

746
00:32:52,882 --> 00:32:53,763
to join your mailing list

747
00:32:53,983 --> 00:32:56,365
because those are cost prohibitive.

748
00:32:56,425 --> 00:32:57,886
It's gotta be something free that they can do.

749
00:32:58,287 --> 00:33:03,249
And all that does is it gets people off of Twitter and onto your mailing list.

750
00:33:03,289 --> 00:33:06,311
Because as we know, people don't quit click links in Twitter.

751
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:07,512
So it's really hard.

752
00:33:07,632 --> 00:33:12,094
And so you need that little bit of a sweetener just to get encourage those clicks onto your

753
00:33:12,114 --> 00:33:12,634
mailing list.

754
00:33:13,175 --> 00:33:14,916
That's why you need that lead magnet.

755
00:33:16,997 --> 00:33:19,058
And what do you do to get your lead magnet to work?

756
00:33:19,598 --> 00:33:21,259
You need to have a call to action.

757
00:33:21,887 --> 00:33:26,792
always have a call to action to join your mailing list and to mention that sweetener.

758
00:33:27,133 --> 00:33:31,597
And here's an example of one. Today I'm proud to announce a free demo for my game Gunminer.

759
00:33:31,898 --> 00:33:35,241
Click the following link, enter your email address, and I'll send you a copy. And then

760
00:33:35,281 --> 00:33:39,505
you've got that link to actually go join your mailing list. This is a fake game that I've...

761
00:33:39,864 --> 00:33:42,546
I've got going here. This is not a real tweet that I actually sent.

762
00:33:42,946 --> 00:33:47,010
But you get the idea. It tells them what to do and where to do it.

763
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:50,373
So when they click that link, a lot of people will just dump that link

764
00:33:50,633 --> 00:33:53,335
to their general website and they got to scroll around their website.

765
00:33:53,736 --> 00:33:58,600
Don't do that. Create a special page on your website just for the sign up for your email list.

766
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:02,383
Here's an example of a great one. This is from the game Nimbatas.

767
00:34:02,423 --> 00:34:04,905
This was a demo that they gave away for joining the mailing list.

768
00:34:05,165 --> 00:34:09,429
This page right here generated 50,000 email list subscribers.

769
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:13,473
And the great thing about it is you can notice there's nothing else going on this page.

770
00:34:13,713 --> 00:34:17,477
The only thing you can do on this page is enter your email address and click that nice

771
00:34:17,517 --> 00:34:19,459
call to action button that says get the demo.

772
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:23,823
You want it very clear because you don't want them to have to hunt around on your page to

773
00:34:23,883 --> 00:34:25,204
find where to put their email address.

774
00:34:25,464 --> 00:34:28,547
You want it to be so dead obvious that they can't miss it.

775
00:34:30,349 --> 00:34:32,914
Okay, next part is something called an autoresponder.

776
00:34:33,255 --> 00:34:36,581
There are very few in these who actually use an autoresponder and it's a shame.

777
00:34:36,661 --> 00:34:38,985
It's one of the most important things you can do with email marketing.

778
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:41,980
Now, an autoresponder is a very simple thing

779
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:44,380
that's built into like every single email program.

780
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:45,820
If you've got MailChimp,

781
00:34:46,161 --> 00:34:48,121
you're gonna have the autoresponder built in.

782
00:34:48,181 --> 00:34:48,761
You can use it.

783
00:34:48,981 --> 00:34:50,061
As long as you're paying for it,

784
00:34:50,161 --> 00:34:51,262
if you've paid for MailChimp,

785
00:34:51,582 --> 00:34:52,782
you've got the autoresponder.

786
00:34:52,802 --> 00:34:53,562
So you should use it.

787
00:34:53,822 --> 00:34:54,623
Let me show you what it is.

788
00:34:55,043 --> 00:34:56,083
When somebody joins a list,

789
00:34:56,403 --> 00:34:57,483
maybe let's say on a Sunday,

790
00:34:57,863 --> 00:35:00,104
you can set up your mailing list

791
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:03,365
to automatically send an email like on the next day.

792
00:35:03,665 --> 00:35:05,365
And so what you do is you pre-write email one,

793
00:35:05,405 --> 00:35:08,186
you say, send this to them a day after they join my list.

794
00:35:08,366 --> 00:35:09,446
And then you write a second email.

795
00:35:09,866 --> 00:35:11,727
and you program it to go off the next day,

796
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:13,607
and then a third one, the third day.

797
00:35:13,947 --> 00:35:15,728
So basically what you do is you're pre-writing

798
00:35:15,768 --> 00:35:17,008
a bunch of marketing messages.

799
00:35:17,388 --> 00:35:18,408
And so when they join your list,

800
00:35:18,588 --> 00:35:20,669
they're receiving those pre-programmed messages.

801
00:35:20,809 --> 00:35:22,269
And it's just an automation

802
00:35:22,569 --> 00:35:24,890
that really boosts the rest of your subscribers.

803
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:26,931
So let me show you why this is so important.

804
00:35:26,951 --> 00:35:28,231
You're like, what's the big deal?

805
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:31,291
OK, remember how I told you those people that maybe like

806
00:35:31,331 --> 00:35:33,071
discover your game and they love your game and they're like,

807
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,032
totally excited.

808
00:35:34,052 --> 00:35:34,952
They're like, take my money.

809
00:35:35,352 --> 00:35:37,173
And you don't have anything good for them to do.

810
00:35:37,493 --> 00:35:39,033
And you don't have them to buy anything.

811
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:39,894
There's nothing they can do.

812
00:35:39,994 --> 00:35:41,554
And that energy just kind of dissipates

813
00:35:41,594 --> 00:35:43,015
and just kind of fades away.

814
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:44,335
That's bad, right?

815
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:46,196
So you follow my advice and you say,

816
00:35:46,236 --> 00:35:48,376
you turn that energy into a call to action

817
00:35:48,657 --> 00:35:50,337
and you get them to like join your mailing list, right?

818
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:54,862
So they join your mailing list, and then you don't send them anything for like six months,

819
00:35:55,442 --> 00:35:59,085
and it slowly fades away. Even if they're on your mailing list, if you don't email them,

820
00:35:59,385 --> 00:36:02,327
they're still going to forget about you and lose track of who you are.

821
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:06,969
So what you got to do is you got to capitalize on this. And you do that with an autoresponder.

822
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:11,112
So when they join your mailing list, they want to throw their money at you. You say,

823
00:36:11,132 --> 00:36:15,034
join my mailing list. What you do is the next day you hit them up with another email that you've

824
00:36:15,054 --> 00:36:15,615
pre-programmed.

825
00:36:16,194 --> 00:36:18,255
And what they are, they're in that honeymoon period.

826
00:36:18,275 --> 00:36:20,196
They're super excited about you, your game.

827
00:36:20,556 --> 00:36:22,738
So you wanna keep that flame alive.

828
00:36:22,818 --> 00:36:24,218
It's like if you just started dating somebody

829
00:36:24,258 --> 00:36:26,380
and you went on a first date

830
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,241
and then your second date was nine months later.

831
00:36:28,641 --> 00:36:29,422
You don't wanna do that.

832
00:36:29,622 --> 00:36:31,603
So what you do is you send this email one,

833
00:36:31,623 --> 00:36:33,144
and then the next day, email two.

834
00:36:33,184 --> 00:36:34,225
And look, they're still excited.

835
00:36:34,505 --> 00:36:35,986
Email three, they're even more excited

836
00:36:36,006 --> 00:36:37,166
because you're sending them good stuff.

837
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:38,487
And then four, they're just like

838
00:36:38,767 --> 00:36:40,288
just throwing money back at you.

839
00:36:40,789 --> 00:36:41,729
Really what you're trying to do

840
00:36:41,829 --> 00:36:44,251
is just keep the flame alive for a few days.

841
00:36:44,751 --> 00:36:48,795
And what happens is they remember you more than just that one flash in the pan where they signed up.

842
00:36:49,116 --> 00:36:51,498
Because the worst thing is six months later they get an email from you like,

843
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:56,943
who were these people? I don't remember. That's why you need to do an autoresponder.

844
00:36:57,484 --> 00:37:00,627
Now the other thing, the other trick with autoresponders is you got to set up what's

845
00:37:00,647 --> 00:37:04,371
called an open loop. Open loop kind of comes from screenwriting.

846
00:37:04,947 --> 00:37:06,988
And if you remember the show Lost,

847
00:37:07,408 --> 00:37:09,728
every episode of the show ended on a cliffhanger.

848
00:37:09,948 --> 00:37:11,309
There was the smoke monster,

849
00:37:11,689 --> 00:37:14,690
and then there was that shaft that had the vault,

850
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:16,650
and they found what was in the bottom of the vault.

851
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:18,130
And then when they got to the bottom of the vault,

852
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:19,391
there was this guy pushing a button,

853
00:37:19,431 --> 00:37:20,631
and why is he pushing a button?

854
00:37:20,851 --> 00:37:22,671
And every episode just kept chaining

855
00:37:22,731 --> 00:37:25,052
these just more and more impossible stories.

856
00:37:25,512 --> 00:37:27,272
And that's what you kind of want to do with your email.

857
00:37:27,613 --> 00:37:29,293
So maybe at the first email, you say,

858
00:37:29,353 --> 00:37:32,094
stay tuned tomorrow, because I'm going to tell you

859
00:37:32,134 --> 00:37:33,854
about the game that almost closed the studio.

860
00:37:34,354 --> 00:37:35,716
And what happens is people are like,

861
00:37:35,736 --> 00:37:36,957
oh my gosh, that's a great story.

862
00:37:36,977 --> 00:37:37,878
I want to hear about that.

863
00:37:38,218 --> 00:37:40,540
And so when email two comes in and you tell that story,

864
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,322
they're more likely to open it.

865
00:37:42,682 --> 00:37:44,063
And then you end two on a cliffhanger,

866
00:37:44,263 --> 00:37:45,925
so they're more likely to open email three.

867
00:37:46,105 --> 00:37:48,427
It's just like those really addictive shows

868
00:37:48,667 --> 00:37:50,069
where they just end on a cliffhanger

869
00:37:50,109 --> 00:37:51,270
so that you open the next one.

870
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:53,052
And it just really boosts your open rates

871
00:37:53,332 --> 00:37:54,733
and makes people love you even more.

872
00:37:54,933 --> 00:37:57,596
So it's a really helpful strategy that nobody really does.

873
00:37:59,157 --> 00:38:03,700
If you like this stuff, if you're interested in email, I gave a talk last year on email marketing,

874
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:07,923
probably if you just search GDC Chris Zukoski, you're going to find it. Here it is from last

875
00:38:07,943 --> 00:38:11,345
year. I went a whole half an hour just on email marketing. It's really helpful.

876
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:17,329
Okay. So the other third problem that I have with a lot of people's email lists is something

877
00:38:17,349 --> 00:38:23,373
called impersonal writing. And I get these emails from indie studios and they just sound like

878
00:38:24,132 --> 00:38:30,454
Boilerplate like they just converted their press release and they just converted to a newsletter and sent it to me like Leaping Lizard Studios

879
00:38:30,514 --> 00:38:35,455
Is proud to announce the forthcoming edition of our next game. You can just hear that voice first off

880
00:38:35,835 --> 00:38:39,796
I know you're just like some dude in your your spare bedroom coding out your game

881
00:38:40,056 --> 00:38:44,337
Don't call yourself a studio be honest with what you are. You're just like one dude, right?

882
00:38:45,178 --> 00:38:46,078
Be that one dude. Don't

883
00:38:46,684 --> 00:38:49,385
claim you're a studio, it's more impressive if you're just one guy.

884
00:38:49,966 --> 00:38:52,908
Second, don't use the word forthcoming. Who uses the word forthcoming?

885
00:38:53,328 --> 00:38:57,370
Instead, you've got to think of email as like a personal communication with two people.

886
00:38:58,371 --> 00:39:01,473
I subscribe to Chrissy Teigen's newsletter, which is actually a pretty good newsletter.

887
00:39:01,493 --> 00:39:04,755
You should subscribe. It's got some good stuff going. But the cool thing about it is,

888
00:39:05,095 --> 00:39:08,918
if you look at my inbox here, it looks like I'm getting a one-to-one person

889
00:39:09,218 --> 00:39:12,800
email from Chrissy Teigen. It's like Chrissy Teigen is emailing me, right?

890
00:39:13,648 --> 00:39:15,730
You've got to use that to your benefit.

891
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:19,112
You are going to appear in somebody else's email

892
00:39:19,833 --> 00:39:20,493
as one person.

893
00:39:20,513 --> 00:39:23,316
So it's like you and your fan are talking one to one.

894
00:39:23,676 --> 00:39:24,577
So write it that way.

895
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:25,818
Like here's an improvement on that.

896
00:39:26,378 --> 00:39:28,960
Hey Chris, it's John, you know, from Leaping Lizard Studios.

897
00:39:29,521 --> 00:39:30,321
You want to see my new game?

898
00:39:30,782 --> 00:39:32,623
See, it sounds like he's talking to me

899
00:39:32,723 --> 00:39:33,944
and that's how you should write your email.

900
00:39:34,425 --> 00:39:37,888
Don't say, hey y'all, hey guys, what's up everybody.

901
00:39:38,168 --> 00:39:39,389
That's not, it's one to one.

902
00:39:39,589 --> 00:39:40,370
So write it that way.

903
00:39:41,447 --> 00:39:45,169
Okay, that's email. I love email marketing. I'm going to show you how this works in real examples

904
00:39:45,469 --> 00:39:50,031
and how I kind of build funnels and really work my marketing across multiple platforms.

905
00:39:50,491 --> 00:39:56,273
Okay, so here's the first one. These are copywriting examples. So this is me, my game Zombie King.

906
00:39:57,337 --> 00:39:58,237
and how I love Imgur.

907
00:39:58,697 --> 00:40:01,258
So remember how I always study users,

908
00:40:01,458 --> 00:40:02,978
and I know the audience of my games.

909
00:40:03,018 --> 00:40:05,319
I make pixel art games, they're retro in feel.

910
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:09,420
So I talk to folks who like my type of game,

911
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:12,600
and they really do like the history of medieval times,

912
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,901
and they like retro games.

913
00:40:14,441 --> 00:40:16,121
So they really kind of have that spirit.

914
00:40:16,821 --> 00:40:19,662
And what I did was I realized that in a trip to Germany,

915
00:40:19,682 --> 00:40:20,942
because I went for a trip,

916
00:40:21,282 --> 00:40:22,842
there was this castle that had a great story,

917
00:40:22,943 --> 00:40:24,243
and that's what inspired my game.

918
00:40:24,723 --> 00:40:27,984
And what I did was I researched into like where this castle came from,

919
00:40:28,004 --> 00:40:31,464
and it turns out it shows up in all these retro games, ironically.

920
00:40:31,564 --> 00:40:34,505
So like all these old Nintendo and Super Nintendo games

921
00:40:34,885 --> 00:40:37,066
have Norshweinstein Castle in it.

922
00:40:37,566 --> 00:40:38,906
And I thought, what a great story.

923
00:40:39,246 --> 00:40:41,086
And so what I did of this is also Zelda.

924
00:40:41,126 --> 00:40:42,107
Look in the top right.

925
00:40:42,707 --> 00:40:44,387
Put the little Norshweinstein Castle. It's so cute.

926
00:40:44,827 --> 00:40:47,608
OK, and so what I did was in my game, I had my artist

927
00:40:47,888 --> 00:40:50,248
add Norshweinstein Castle to my game cover.

928
00:40:50,528 --> 00:40:53,449
So I kind of have this continuity and this callback to retro games.

929
00:40:54,144 --> 00:40:56,445
And so I wrote an Imgur post all about that,

930
00:40:56,465 --> 00:40:58,946
about my trip to Germany, all the games that had it,

931
00:40:59,446 --> 00:41:00,106
and guess what?

932
00:41:00,386 --> 00:41:01,587
It made it to the front page.

933
00:41:02,307 --> 00:41:04,788
And so thousands and thousands of people on Imgur

934
00:41:04,808 --> 00:41:07,549
were totally jazzed about this great story that I had.

935
00:41:08,009 --> 00:41:09,070
And what do I do with that?

936
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:11,831
You know, what?

937
00:41:12,771 --> 00:41:14,952
Actually, don't, no, don't do a call to action on Imgur.

938
00:41:15,012 --> 00:41:16,373
Imgur hates call to actions.

939
00:41:16,433 --> 00:41:17,553
You gotta know your platform.

940
00:41:17,854 --> 00:41:19,774
So don't do a call to action right away on Imgur.

941
00:41:20,034 --> 00:41:22,055
Basically, I let it sit there for a little while.

942
00:41:22,458 --> 00:41:24,199
And then I added a call to action.

943
00:41:25,019 --> 00:41:26,299
You don't want to put a call to action

944
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,120
immediately on Reddit, on Imgur, or Reddit,

945
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,321
because they'll downvote you right away.

946
00:41:29,641 --> 00:41:31,701
And so what I did was I just made it more personal

947
00:41:31,761 --> 00:41:33,322
and more so like they were helping me.

948
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:36,103
So this was my call to action on the bottom of the post.

949
00:41:36,383 --> 00:41:38,444
I'm actually looking for some beta testers for it right now.

950
00:41:38,524 --> 00:41:40,645
If you're interested in my game, sign up here.

951
00:41:40,725 --> 00:41:43,846
And then I had a link, and it goes to a landing page

952
00:41:43,866 --> 00:41:46,207
where the only thing they can do was sign up for my game.

953
00:41:47,067 --> 00:41:49,268
So that's an example of using a call to action

954
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:51,189
with a top of the funnel thing like Imgur.

955
00:41:52,029 --> 00:41:57,915
Okay, so this is example two for email marketing. This is a client that I consulted for. This is

956
00:41:58,115 --> 00:42:03,421
Minion Masters by BetaDwarf. They hired me to help them with their email setup. And so let me show

957
00:42:03,461 --> 00:42:09,567
you exactly what I did for them. Okay, so Minion Masters is a free-to-play collectible card game.

958
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:11,649
And the weird thing about

959
00:42:12,949 --> 00:42:15,212
free-to-play games is their funnel is actually kind of upside down.

960
00:42:15,712 --> 00:42:19,476
So the awareness phase is actually Steam and if they're interested in the game

961
00:42:19,516 --> 00:42:21,498
they can just install it because it's free.

962
00:42:21,979 --> 00:42:24,822
So installing the game is very top of the funnel

963
00:42:25,342 --> 00:42:27,925
and then they've got a lot of middle funnel stuff where they're actually

964
00:42:27,985 --> 00:42:31,069
playing the game and if your game is cool in a free-to-play

965
00:42:31,109 --> 00:42:32,090
game and they like it

966
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:37,053
then they're going to take action and actually buy something like IAP or Minion Masters that

967
00:42:37,093 --> 00:42:40,775
has a season pass. So that's what you're trying to do, is you're really trying to get people

968
00:42:40,915 --> 00:42:44,877
within the game to go down to the action phase. It's tricky. If you look at their game,

969
00:42:45,137 --> 00:42:49,219
it's a very complex game for new players. And so what I did was...

970
00:42:50,269 --> 00:42:52,350
I did what I always do, which is I talk to the users.

971
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:56,213
So I look through their forums, I talk to their community,

972
00:42:56,573 --> 00:42:58,554
I talk to their moderators,

973
00:42:58,894 --> 00:43:00,415
I talk to their community manager,

974
00:43:00,715 --> 00:43:02,316
and I really found some folks

975
00:43:02,336 --> 00:43:03,817
who are kind of representative of their community,

976
00:43:03,937 --> 00:43:05,358
and I had one-on-one interviews with them,

977
00:43:05,398 --> 00:43:07,679
because I wanted to find out how did they get into the game,

978
00:43:07,899 --> 00:43:09,360
what do they dislike about the game,

979
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:10,761
what could be improved about it.

980
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,522
and what they would recommend if I were telling a new player

981
00:43:14,762 --> 00:43:15,543
to get into the game.

982
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,864
And so I took tons of notes, and I set up

983
00:43:18,324 --> 00:43:20,205
what was a strategy for them.

984
00:43:20,465 --> 00:43:22,446
So we knew that there was a complex game

985
00:43:22,466 --> 00:43:24,507
with a steep learning curve, and retention

986
00:43:24,547 --> 00:43:26,088
is decided in the early days, right?

987
00:43:26,468 --> 00:43:27,629
So we don't want them to bail.

988
00:43:28,009 --> 00:43:29,670
And we need to establish that relationship,

989
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:32,671
because Betadwarf is very good with the community.

990
00:43:32,691 --> 00:43:34,532
They're very nice people, and I really

991
00:43:34,552 --> 00:43:37,173
wanted to emphasize how good they are for their community.

992
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:42,874
And the interesting thing is this is a PC and Xbox game, so it's not like a mobile free-to-play

993
00:43:42,934 --> 00:43:45,836
where that game is always in their pocket where they could play it at the checkout aisle.

994
00:43:46,337 --> 00:43:49,900
There's big times where they may play it in the morning and in the evenings, but all during the

995
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:53,823
day they're separated from the game so they can't check in on it. So those were the kind of

996
00:43:53,884 --> 00:43:58,668
challenges I was trying to solve here. And here's the solution I came up with for their email.

997
00:43:59,128 --> 00:43:59,248
So

998
00:44:00,006 --> 00:44:01,568
Of course, the awareness phase is Steam.

999
00:44:01,608 --> 00:44:04,392
They find the game through Steam and then they join it.

1000
00:44:04,452 --> 00:44:08,197
So what we did was we embedded a signup form within the game.

1001
00:44:08,537 --> 00:44:12,242
And what they would do is get free codes by what it was like a splash page

1002
00:44:12,282 --> 00:44:13,444
when they first signed into the game.

1003
00:44:13,918 --> 00:44:15,659
And because it's a collectible card game,

1004
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:17,940
we could give them cards through little codes

1005
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:18,560
that we sent them.

1006
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,621
And what that happened was,

1007
00:44:21,181 --> 00:44:22,502
once they signed up for the email,

1008
00:44:22,842 --> 00:44:24,082
we used an auto responder,

1009
00:44:24,122 --> 00:44:25,383
just like I said, those open loops.

1010
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:26,983
And so they got daily emails.

1011
00:44:27,324 --> 00:44:29,464
Every single day, they got an email from Minion Masters.

1012
00:44:29,785 --> 00:44:31,525
And we taught them the rules of the games,

1013
00:44:31,885 --> 00:44:32,766
and I gave them gifts

1014
00:44:32,826 --> 00:44:34,326
so that they would keep opening the emails.

1015
00:44:34,346 --> 00:44:35,507
Because if you get an email,

1016
00:44:35,787 --> 00:44:37,207
and you know that there's going to be a gift in that,

1017
00:44:37,427 --> 00:44:38,468
you better believe you're going to open it.

1018
00:44:39,028 --> 00:44:41,049
And so then I also introduced them to the studio

1019
00:44:41,069 --> 00:44:43,230
and taught them who the people were behind the scenes.

1020
00:44:44,516 --> 00:44:45,897
So let me show you an example of an email.

1021
00:44:46,197 --> 00:44:47,138
Now this is one email.

1022
00:44:47,198 --> 00:44:50,721
It's a big, long, awesome email, but I can't show it very easily

1023
00:44:50,962 --> 00:44:53,444
on a slide share, so I kind of sliced it together.

1024
00:44:53,464 --> 00:44:54,925
But this is just one email that I sent.

1025
00:44:55,946 --> 00:44:59,990
So we've got Stefan, who's the CEO and founder of BetaDwarf.

1026
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:01,531
I wanted to put him right up front.

1027
00:45:01,771 --> 00:45:03,632
You know how it was like, even though they are a big studio,

1028
00:45:03,652 --> 00:45:05,833
they've got several employees, big team,

1029
00:45:06,134 --> 00:45:07,354
I still wanted to make it personal.

1030
00:45:07,394 --> 00:45:09,936
Just like that guy, John, who was in the basement

1031
00:45:10,236 --> 00:45:12,097
working on his game, I wanted it to be human.

1032
00:45:12,318 --> 00:45:14,139
He's kind of like the Walt Disney who would introduce

1033
00:45:14,379 --> 00:45:16,620
the show every afternoon on Disney Sundays.

1034
00:45:17,001 --> 00:45:18,201
So he's there and he says,

1035
00:45:18,522 --> 00:45:19,582
hey, my name is Stefan.

1036
00:45:19,702 --> 00:45:21,364
Look, he introduces himself right up front.

1037
00:45:21,924 --> 00:45:23,445
And then right away, we gave him a gift

1038
00:45:23,545 --> 00:45:25,006
because really, we gotta be honest,

1039
00:45:25,026 --> 00:45:25,926
that's what people are here for.

1040
00:45:26,282 --> 00:45:28,724
So we gave them a free copy of a couple cards.

1041
00:45:29,004 --> 00:45:31,526
Those are fake codes, but we really gave them real codes

1042
00:45:31,546 --> 00:45:32,327
that they could enter in.

1043
00:45:33,808 --> 00:45:36,810
And then what I did was every email in the sequence

1044
00:45:37,971 --> 00:45:39,873
trained people on a certain aspect of the game.

1045
00:45:40,313 --> 00:45:42,535
Now, I knew from my interviews and looking at the forums,

1046
00:45:42,595 --> 00:45:44,677
people are very concerned about how to rank up in the game.

1047
00:45:45,215 --> 00:45:50,597
So I wrote a nice clear heading about how to rank up and then I broke it into sections like what is a good rank?

1048
00:45:50,917 --> 00:45:56,038
How do you gain rank? Remember they look for those subheads first and then they go back and read the text

1049
00:45:56,318 --> 00:45:59,039
So I really wanted to make sure it was clear what that was going on

1050
00:46:00,199 --> 00:46:02,160
And then finally, what do you do at the end?

1051
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:09,322
Always have a call to action. So at the bottom of every email we did a different

1052
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:13,903
call to action and only one because if you put too many calls to action,

1053
00:46:14,083 --> 00:46:15,264
they're not going to do any of them.

1054
00:46:15,644 --> 00:46:17,465
So each email would pick the different thing to do.

1055
00:46:17,605 --> 00:46:20,667
In this case, I know that people really like to check the patch notes.

1056
00:46:21,007 --> 00:46:22,588
So I did a special call to action of,

1057
00:46:22,828 --> 00:46:25,269
hey, here's how you find patch notes.

1058
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:28,251
By doing that, they learn the community,

1059
00:46:28,291 --> 00:46:29,912
learn where to go to get patch notes.

1060
00:46:30,492 --> 00:46:32,733
Every day with this autoresponder sequence,

1061
00:46:32,753 --> 00:46:34,074
we sent them to do different things.

1062
00:46:34,134 --> 00:46:36,815
It just depended on what was important for the studio to do.

1063
00:46:38,065 --> 00:46:39,845
And then finally, we did our open loop.

1064
00:46:40,245 --> 00:46:42,426
Now, remember the open loop is where we tell people

1065
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:45,027
what to do next so that they're excited for the next email.

1066
00:46:45,387 --> 00:46:47,527
I like the graphic that the graphic designer

1067
00:46:47,567 --> 00:46:48,788
and marketing team picked for this one.

1068
00:46:48,828 --> 00:46:50,348
It was a guy looking off into the distance,

1069
00:46:50,628 --> 00:46:51,429
just like what we are doing.

1070
00:46:51,449 --> 00:46:53,589
We're saying, hey, tomorrow, or in this case,

1071
00:46:53,909 --> 00:46:54,770
we did it a couple of weeks,

1072
00:46:55,010 --> 00:46:57,490
we're gonna tell you how to play the Guild system

1073
00:46:57,550 --> 00:46:59,411
because Guild systems are very important for them.

1074
00:46:59,811 --> 00:47:01,792
So that's why we kind of left this open loop

1075
00:47:02,212 --> 00:47:03,232
to boost that open rate.

1076
00:47:03,892 --> 00:47:06,033
So let me show you the results based on what happened

1077
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:07,793
when we implemented this autoresponder.

1078
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:10,871
Now, they have a great community manager,

1079
00:47:11,191 --> 00:47:13,832
and they've got an existing really good system going on.

1080
00:47:13,852 --> 00:47:14,932
They've got Discord going.

1081
00:47:15,092 --> 00:47:16,833
They actually had an email list before I started,

1082
00:47:17,133 --> 00:47:18,433
and they use Twitter a lot too.

1083
00:47:18,913 --> 00:47:20,674
So they have some existing platforms.

1084
00:47:20,854 --> 00:47:23,555
And what we did was, this was for a weekend deal

1085
00:47:23,595 --> 00:47:24,935
that we were setting up a bunch of marketing.

1086
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:27,736
So we had, my first email was going out.

1087
00:47:28,056 --> 00:47:29,956
We also mentioned it on Discord here.

1088
00:47:29,996 --> 00:47:31,917
They've got one of the largest Discord servers

1089
00:47:32,177 --> 00:47:33,257
in all of Discord.

1090
00:47:33,357 --> 00:47:34,858
They are really killing it with Discord.

1091
00:47:35,257 --> 00:47:36,238
and they've got Twitter too.

1092
00:47:36,638 --> 00:47:39,179
Now, when all those marketing push went out,

1093
00:47:39,219 --> 00:47:40,639
my emails went out in this Discord,

1094
00:47:40,719 --> 00:47:42,840
I was checking and I was a little worried

1095
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,741
because here they had this weekend deal

1096
00:47:45,101 --> 00:47:46,441
and I looked at their Discord

1097
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:48,102
and look at down there below.

1098
00:47:48,122 --> 00:47:51,203
I was like, oh my God, here I am.

1099
00:47:51,283 --> 00:47:52,864
I'm trying to prove how good email is.

1100
00:47:53,364 --> 00:47:54,325
And when we look at it,

1101
00:47:54,725 --> 00:47:56,905
look at all those emojis they have down there.

1102
00:47:57,226 --> 00:47:58,406
Email doesn't have those emojis.

1103
00:47:58,446 --> 00:47:59,667
Look, it's got 96 flame emojis.

1104
00:48:01,875 --> 00:48:07,740
People are loving Discord so much they put 96 flame emojis and there's there's 22 emojis of anime girls

1105
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:15,106
Email doesn't do emojis of anime girls. Like am I out of touch? Am I old? What's going on here? Email is still cool, right?

1106
00:48:16,046 --> 00:48:19,069
How can I compete with discord right? I was worried. I was honestly worried

1107
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:24,593
And then the numbers came back after the weekend deal. We kind of parsed the numbers. Here's the numbers

1108
00:48:25,094 --> 00:48:31,278
Um email still killed it still killed it. Like I said email is the highest performing

1109
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:37,246
way to click in the universe. Nothing beats email in the whole universe. Even emoji girls,

1110
00:48:37,306 --> 00:48:43,229
even if you get 22 emoji anime girls, that's still not as good as email. So email had twice

1111
00:48:43,649 --> 00:48:50,252
as much as both Discord and Twitter combined when you look at the click percentage. It's out of the

1112
00:48:50,372 --> 00:48:55,295
park. Email is just so good when it comes to getting people to click. It's just unheard of.

1113
00:48:56,540 --> 00:48:59,461
Now, we did that autoresponder, and it sounds crazy, right?

1114
00:48:59,761 --> 00:49:02,682
Like nine days of daily emails.

1115
00:49:03,002 --> 00:49:04,123
And I thought it was a little crazy.

1116
00:49:04,163 --> 00:49:05,483
I was like, I'm going to take a risk on this.

1117
00:49:05,503 --> 00:49:07,884
We're going to do nine emails every day.

1118
00:49:08,464 --> 00:49:13,466
And at the end of the nine days when people newly joined the email list, I sent out a

1119
00:49:13,907 --> 00:49:14,627
survey to them.

1120
00:49:15,107 --> 00:49:17,048
And I said, I just asked them a question.

1121
00:49:17,664 --> 00:49:19,146
How did you like those emails?

1122
00:49:19,707 --> 00:49:22,130
Were they too much, too little, just right?

1123
00:49:23,772 --> 00:49:26,655
OK, 94% of the responders to this survey

1124
00:49:27,016 --> 00:49:29,879
said that the emails were great.

1125
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:33,384
40% actually wished there were more than daily emails.

1126
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:35,991
I don't know if they wanted twice a day,

1127
00:49:36,332 --> 00:49:38,553
what they wanted, they wanted for a whole year daily emails.

1128
00:49:38,773 --> 00:49:41,375
I don't know what it is, but 40% wanted more.

1129
00:49:42,136 --> 00:49:43,396
Even at, oh, I love email,

1130
00:49:43,757 --> 00:49:45,198
I'm not gonna do more than a daily email.

1131
00:49:45,578 --> 00:49:47,439
So just don't be afraid

1132
00:49:47,479 --> 00:49:49,080
because people like multiple emails.

1133
00:49:50,041 --> 00:49:51,522
6% said, nah, it's a little too much,

1134
00:49:51,842 --> 00:49:52,803
but I'm willing to take that

1135
00:49:52,863 --> 00:49:56,545
because 94% of people on their mailing list

1136
00:49:56,845 --> 00:49:57,966
love these daily emails.

1137
00:49:58,326 --> 00:49:59,487
It was amazing.

1138
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:07,043
So this GDC is a little weird this year. I can't answer questions live, but I will answer your

1139
00:50:07,203 --> 00:50:12,185
email or your questions on Twitter. Just tweet at me, even if this is two years ago and it's like

1140
00:50:12,645 --> 00:50:16,507
2024 or something, you can still tweet at me and ask questions about this presentation. I'll answer

1141
00:50:16,527 --> 00:50:21,110
them. I love this stuff. I love to answer these things. I'll be honest to answer you here.

1142
00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:27,713
One last thing. Thanks for coming to my talk. One last thing, though. You know it's going.

1143
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:32,191
Okay, I appreciate you coming to my talk. As a special gift, I'm going to give away a free copy

1144
00:50:32,211 --> 00:50:36,556
of my book. It's all about how to do email marketing. It's a free copy. All you got to do

1145
00:50:36,696 --> 00:50:41,842
is go to my link right here, click that big button. I don't think it actually works on

1146
00:50:41,862 --> 00:50:45,326
YouTube. You just got to type that in. So howtomarketagame.com slash gdc20.

1150
00:50:58,176 --> 00:51:02,498
helpful. I don't spam because I'm a very good marketer. But that's it. And thank you very
