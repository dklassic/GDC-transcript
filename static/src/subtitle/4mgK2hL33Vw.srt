1
00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:13,052
Thank you.

2
00:00:50,143 --> 00:00:51,823
All right, I can't, I can't, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:51,903 --> 00:00:53,704
I just can't, I just can't do it anymore.

4
00:00:53,784 --> 00:00:55,145
I cannot take it.

5
00:00:55,605 --> 00:01:00,286
This guy, Gordon Freeman, regularly makes every list

6
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:02,087
of the greatest video game characters of all time

7
00:01:02,127 --> 00:01:03,628
and I don't understand why.

8
00:01:03,648 --> 00:01:06,729
I can't possibly be the only person in this room

9
00:01:06,769 --> 00:01:08,209
who every time he picks up a controller

10
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:10,510
thinks that there is something wrong with him.

11
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:15,032
He's walking around picking up ammo and health packs

12
00:01:15,092 --> 00:01:17,553
and people are trying to tell him important things.

13
00:01:22,614 --> 00:01:26,957
Before I go on, I've been asked to remind everyone to turn off their cell phones

14
00:01:28,098 --> 00:01:31,401
and to please fill out your evaluations after the session,

15
00:01:32,361 --> 00:01:35,624
unless, of course, you work for Valve, in which case maybe that just got a little awkward.

16
00:01:37,065 --> 00:01:40,228
All right, where was I? All right, I was making fun of this guy.

17
00:01:43,811 --> 00:01:49,215
But this problem, this Gordon Freeman problem, is, to my mind, just one manifestation.

18
00:01:49,661 --> 00:01:53,885
of a common problem in video games today, and that is weak character work.

19
00:01:54,745 --> 00:01:56,687
Now, character is hard, and it's hard in any medium.

20
00:01:57,207 --> 00:02:01,051
And it's particularly hard in games, which have some unique requirements for doing a

21
00:02:01,091 --> 00:02:02,732
good job of establishing character.

22
00:02:03,353 --> 00:02:08,157
First and foremost, in games, the audience is expected to become the character.

23
00:02:08,957 --> 00:02:10,699
We are one of the characters.

24
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:13,341
It's not enough to have empathy or sympathy with the characters.

25
00:02:13,361 --> 00:02:17,024
We actually have to have a sense of oneness, a sense of unity between the two.

26
00:02:18,497 --> 00:02:21,879
And secondly, there are so many different types of games,

27
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:23,340
so many different sub-genres,

28
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,142
and almost every one of them has its own peculiar,

29
00:02:27,222 --> 00:02:30,163
particular requirements for establishing characters.

30
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:33,105
I mean, linear games, right, fully scripted narratives,

31
00:02:33,485 --> 00:02:35,406
these have completely different requirements

32
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:37,867
from open-world sandbox games where anything can happen.

33
00:02:39,248 --> 00:02:40,609
And on top of the different types of games,

34
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:42,930
we have different ways of presenting characters

35
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:43,671
within those games.

36
00:02:43,711 --> 00:02:45,652
We have the silent characters, right,

37
00:02:45,672 --> 00:02:46,592
the ones who have no voice.

38
00:02:46,632 --> 00:02:47,913
We have the cinematic characters.

39
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,451
The ones who are fully scripted.

40
00:02:49,831 --> 00:02:51,012
We have the open characters.

41
00:02:51,652 --> 00:02:54,834
The ones where we let the players choose who they are.

42
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:59,097
And most games I think fit within these broad categories.

43
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,157
They're spectrums, right?

44
00:03:00,177 --> 00:03:01,918
So there's some hybrids that fall in between.

45
00:03:01,938 --> 00:03:05,400
You have a game like Halo, where your character speaks,

46
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,041
but he doesn't really say anything.

47
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:09,683
And then you've got games like Mass Effect, right?

48
00:03:09,703 --> 00:03:11,204
Where there's lots of player choice,

49
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:12,905
but it's still heavily scripted.

50
00:03:15,092 --> 00:03:18,833
So many different types of games out there with so many different demands.

51
00:03:19,154 --> 00:03:28,238
Is it even conceivable that there could be some kind of grand unified theory of character in games that applies to all of them?

52
00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:33,540
Well, as it happens, I think there is.

53
00:03:34,241 --> 00:03:36,382
And over the next 45 minutes, I'd like to tell you all about it.

54
00:03:36,702 --> 00:03:38,643
But first, I'd like to talk about myself.

55
00:03:40,384 --> 00:03:43,505
My name is Jeremy Bernstein. I am a hyphenate writer and game designer.

56
00:03:44,336 --> 00:03:48,838
I have designed games about everything from Ben 10 to congressional redistricting.

57
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:50,459
Super sexy.

58
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:56,542
And I've written games on everything from Dead Space 2 to Pretty in Pink.

59
00:03:58,723 --> 00:04:02,284
I've also recently been working in Hollywood as a television writer for the hit series

60
00:04:02,504 --> 00:04:02,945
Leverage.

61
00:04:03,885 --> 00:04:07,186
Now, I've gone and used a dirty word just there.

62
00:04:10,679 --> 00:04:14,240
Hollywood writers are not usually very well thought of in the video game industry.

63
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:18,581
It's generally perceived that they don't understand the specifics of games as a medium,

64
00:04:18,621 --> 00:04:20,901
the things that make them different from film or television.

65
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:23,682
And in general, I believe that's true.

66
00:04:24,402 --> 00:04:29,583
However, as someone who's worked on both sides of that particular divide, I also believe

67
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:33,743
that sometimes we in the games industry have a tendency to throw the baby out with the

68
00:04:33,783 --> 00:04:36,844
bathwater when it comes to the ideas that come out of Hollywood.

69
00:04:38,354 --> 00:04:43,717
Because despite the problems, these ideas are grounded in 3,000 years worth of fundamental

70
00:04:43,937 --> 00:04:45,598
human storytelling traditions.

71
00:04:46,538 --> 00:04:52,902
And whether you're talking about Oedipus Rex or Walter White, it all kind of works the

72
00:04:52,962 --> 00:04:53,282
same.

73
00:04:54,222 --> 00:04:58,685
So, maybe, just maybe, there's something that we can mine out of these ideas that'll give

74
00:04:58,745 --> 00:04:59,945
us some insight into this guy.

75
00:05:01,606 --> 00:05:03,787
Now, before I go any further, a disclaimer.

76
00:05:05,695 --> 00:05:08,196
Every game that I talk about today is a game that I love.

77
00:05:09,636 --> 00:05:11,918
Games that I don't love, I left out of the talk.

78
00:05:13,498 --> 00:05:18,440
Now as you may have noticed, I am going to be from time to time speaking critically about

79
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,502
some of these games, particularly about certain elements of character.

80
00:05:22,442 --> 00:05:25,884
But these are bits, these are pieces, these are moments that don't work for me.

81
00:05:26,264 --> 00:05:32,066
And I find deconstructing those moments, to find out why they don't work, to be extremely

82
00:05:32,107 --> 00:05:32,587
instructive.

83
00:05:33,947 --> 00:05:34,948
But every game I talk about.

84
00:05:35,465 --> 00:05:36,886
is a game that I love. Are we clear?

85
00:05:38,406 --> 00:05:40,707
Alright. Let's start off with a question then.

86
00:05:42,247 --> 00:05:45,588
Why bother? Why characters? Why are characters important in games?

87
00:05:45,988 --> 00:05:49,869
Are characters even important in games? Tetris didn't need characters.

88
00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:54,210
Well, the answer of course is no, we don't need characters.

89
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:57,551
What we need in games is avatars. We need something that we can control.

90
00:05:58,451 --> 00:06:01,192
And this is one of the first pitfalls that we run into when we're talking about

91
00:06:01,232 --> 00:06:03,072
character in games, is confusing

92
00:06:03,632 --> 00:06:05,053
character and avatar.

93
00:06:06,327 --> 00:06:12,210
For example, I think most people would say that Pac-Man is one of the most popular video game characters of all time.

94
00:06:13,571 --> 00:06:18,294
But really, when push comes to shove, Pac-Man is not all that different from this.

95
00:06:20,456 --> 00:06:21,917
He's an avatar, not a character.

96
00:06:22,157 --> 00:06:24,979
And if I were looking to start a fight, which it's just possible that I am,

97
00:06:25,799 --> 00:06:31,403
I might argue that the original incarnations of these two guys are really, basically, just Tetris blocks.

98
00:06:33,605 --> 00:06:34,625
So what's the difference between...

99
00:06:35,138 --> 00:06:38,179
character in Avatar? Well, the difference is context.

100
00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:41,299
Avatars give a game mechanical

101
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,920
context. I mean, when you think about it, games are really just systems

102
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,361
of numbers. What is Space Invaders other than some vector calculations,

103
00:06:49,521 --> 00:06:54,762
three hit point reservoirs, and collision detection? But nobody wants to play that.

104
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,082
So we create an avatar

105
00:06:58,182 --> 00:07:01,463
to make some sense of it. It's a way to create engagement

106
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:04,463
with the players that the sheer system of the math wouldn't have.

107
00:07:06,047 --> 00:07:13,889
So avatars provide a mechanical context, but characters, characters provide emotional context.

108
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:17,991
And this is important because we are emotional beings.

109
00:07:19,351 --> 00:07:23,932
Characters engage us, emotions engage us, and if you want proof, look no further than

110
00:07:23,972 --> 00:07:24,392
this game.

111
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:31,654
Now if you played this game and you didn't have an emotional experience, I don't think

112
00:07:31,694 --> 00:07:32,455
you're fully human.

113
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:38,552
But it was because of the character work, not because of the gameplay.

114
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:39,913
There's barely any gameplay.

115
00:07:40,373 --> 00:07:44,075
In fact, there's a whole talk this morning on whether or not this is actually a game.

116
00:07:44,636 --> 00:07:47,477
And by the way, if this isn't a game, then I don't want to be a gamer.

117
00:07:49,619 --> 00:07:54,122
But more than that, there's even data that suggests that characters are more engaging

118
00:07:54,202 --> 00:07:56,203
in games to players than narrative is.

119
00:07:56,503 --> 00:07:59,185
If anyone was at the Game Narrative Summit earlier this week,

120
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:02,867
there was a presentation from Deborah Henderson, a user researcher at Microsoft,

121
00:08:03,267 --> 00:08:04,908
about measuring player engagement in games.

122
00:08:05,245 --> 00:08:11,289
And one of her key findings was that game characters were more memorable to players than the plot.

123
00:08:14,931 --> 00:08:18,354
So to those who asked why character, I would respond in short,

124
00:08:18,934 --> 00:08:21,836
because science says it will make people like your game more.

125
00:08:23,197 --> 00:08:25,238
I'm paraphrasing Dr. Henderson slightly there.

126
00:08:27,099 --> 00:08:28,080
So character, where do we start?

127
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:31,122
Well, as with all good things, let us start with a definition.

128
00:08:31,763 --> 00:08:33,964
What exactly is character?

129
00:08:34,938 --> 00:08:36,339
Well, broadly speaking, I would say,

130
00:08:36,359 --> 00:08:40,021
the people in the story.

131
00:08:41,802 --> 00:08:44,443
I bet everyone is feeling really good about paying for those badges right about now.

132
00:08:46,664 --> 00:08:49,385
But I bring this up for a reason, right? Because character are the people

133
00:08:49,925 --> 00:08:53,727
in the story. So in order to understand the definition

134
00:08:53,847 --> 00:08:56,888
of character, we first need to understand the definition of story.

135
00:08:57,028 --> 00:09:00,950
Now, whenever somebody at a games conference gives a talk about story,

136
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:04,192
someone in the audience inevitably asks this question.

137
00:09:06,095 --> 00:09:08,236
Story in games must we?

138
00:09:09,696 --> 00:09:12,398
And like character, no, of course we don't need stories.

139
00:09:12,658 --> 00:09:13,998
But we want stories.

140
00:09:14,298 --> 00:09:15,459
We like stories.

141
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,500
We crave stories.

142
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,122
Human beings apply storytelling to every form of art that we have invented.

143
00:09:23,202 --> 00:09:25,563
Music doesn't need story, but we create opera.

144
00:09:26,464 --> 00:09:31,086
Paintings are perfectly happy to be landscapes or portraits, but we're not happy with that.

145
00:09:32,909 --> 00:09:38,693
So no, we don't need stories in our games, but damn it, if we're going to have stories in our games, let's do them right.

146
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:42,775
And good stories require good characters.

147
00:09:43,656 --> 00:09:47,759
Not just for all of the reasons I'm about to explain, but also because science.

148
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,541
Alright, so back to our definition of story.

149
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:55,423
If you've ever heard me talk before, then you know the definition of story that I subscribe to,

150
00:09:55,844 --> 00:09:56,444
and that is this.

151
00:09:57,605 --> 00:10:01,447
Someone who wants something badly, and is having a hard time getting it.

152
00:10:04,143 --> 00:10:07,144
And the reason that I like this definition so much,

153
00:10:07,204 --> 00:10:10,246
particularly for games, is that it splits stories

154
00:10:10,326 --> 00:10:12,027
into two fundamental elements.

155
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:17,170
Objectives and obstacles.

156
00:10:19,091 --> 00:10:20,692
And these are terms that we're used to thinking about when

157
00:10:20,712 --> 00:10:21,592
we think about games.

158
00:10:21,632 --> 00:10:23,113
Objectives are so important, we put them

159
00:10:23,193 --> 00:10:24,133
right up front on the HUD.

160
00:10:25,354 --> 00:10:28,496
An obstacle, well, that's just another word for gameplay.

161
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:31,197
And right here.

162
00:10:31,844 --> 00:10:34,485
is why good story requires good character.

163
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:38,086
All stories start with someone.

164
00:10:40,127 --> 00:10:43,028
This someone is our character. We generally call them our protagonist.

165
00:10:43,989 --> 00:10:47,730
The protagonist has an objective, something that they want badly.

166
00:10:49,371 --> 00:10:52,052
In between the character and their want, there are a series of obstacles.

167
00:10:53,132 --> 00:10:57,734
The character proceeds forward, pursuing their want, overcoming the obstacles,

168
00:10:57,754 --> 00:11:00,235
until they reach their objective, and the story ends.

169
00:11:00,981 --> 00:11:03,082
That, in a nutshell, is every story.

170
00:11:04,303 --> 00:11:06,704
So, if this is our definition of story,

171
00:11:06,744 --> 00:11:07,904
someone who wants something badly

172
00:11:07,924 --> 00:11:09,105
and is having a hard time getting it,

173
00:11:09,765 --> 00:11:12,046
then our definition of character must logically be

174
00:11:14,287 --> 00:11:15,508
someone who wants something badly.

175
00:11:16,948 --> 00:11:21,591
Someone who wants something badly.

176
00:11:24,192 --> 00:11:26,673
And by the way, this isn't just a good definition

177
00:11:26,733 --> 00:11:27,553
for a protagonist.

178
00:11:27,894 --> 00:11:30,095
Ideally, this is a definition for all of your characters.

179
00:11:30,402 --> 00:11:32,323
All the characters in your story want something.

180
00:11:33,103 --> 00:11:36,084
The antagonist wants something, and whatever that something is,

181
00:11:36,544 --> 00:11:39,424
it is that which creates the obstacles that our hero must face.

182
00:11:39,444 --> 00:11:42,785
The love interest wants something.

183
00:11:43,085 --> 00:11:45,126
Presumably, what they want is the protagonist.

184
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:50,247
Every character, every sidekick, every quest-gigger, every mook,

185
00:11:50,647 --> 00:11:53,988
every random NPC, every character in your story

186
00:11:54,248 --> 00:11:57,048
should be someone who wants something badly.

187
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:03,884
And that's one of the reasons why I think the story in this game is so effective.

188
00:12:04,064 --> 00:12:08,968
All the major characters in Uncharted 2 have a strong want.

189
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:13,932
And more than that, these wants are almost always in direct competition with each other,

190
00:12:13,992 --> 00:12:16,334
if not mutually exclusive from each other.

191
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,335
Let's start with Drake.

192
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:21,878
Now, Drake actually has multiple wants in this game.

193
00:12:21,918 --> 00:12:23,380
First and foremost, he wants a treasure,

194
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,083
a want in which he is opposed by the antagonist, Lazarovic,

195
00:12:27,563 --> 00:12:28,904
who also wants a treasure.

196
00:12:29,687 --> 00:12:30,567
Well, they can't both have it.

197
00:12:31,787 --> 00:12:34,208
So right there, our wants lock us into conflict.

198
00:12:35,509 --> 00:12:38,550
Now, Nate also wants revenge on Flynn for double-crossing him,

199
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:41,311
and this is a want that Flynn understandably opposes.

200
00:12:42,611 --> 00:12:45,232
And by the way, Flynn also wants the treasure, right?

201
00:12:45,292 --> 00:12:47,773
So there's another angle to that particular conflict.

202
00:12:49,534 --> 00:12:52,235
Romantically, Nate wants a relationship with Elena

203
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,276
or possibly also a relationship with Chloe.

204
00:12:55,745 --> 00:12:59,586
The two of them both want a relationship with him, which, outside the realm of fanfiction,

205
00:12:59,626 --> 00:13:00,907
are mutually exclusive wants.

206
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:07,789
And by the way, Chloe also wants the treasure, so she's part of that whole mess as well.

207
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:14,832
So you have all these different characters, all with their conflicting objectives, all

208
00:13:14,852 --> 00:13:18,953
with their diametrically opposed wants, all bouncing off of each other to make life difficult

209
00:13:19,253 --> 00:13:20,654
for our hero, for the player.

210
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,815
And that is why a good story requires good character.

211
00:13:25,478 --> 00:13:27,759
Because opposing wants create conflict.

212
00:13:28,439 --> 00:13:32,040
And conflict is not just drama, conflict is gameplay.

213
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:36,822
So this is how we define character,

214
00:13:36,902 --> 00:13:38,282
someone who wants something badly.

215
00:13:38,502 --> 00:13:40,603
All right, now how do we create character?

216
00:13:41,483 --> 00:13:44,064
Well, character has three elements.

217
00:13:44,504 --> 00:13:46,885
And the first most fundamental of those is this.

218
00:13:47,965 --> 00:13:48,685
What do they want?

219
00:13:50,306 --> 00:13:51,406
Which makes sense, right?

220
00:13:51,546 --> 00:13:53,027
This is our definition of character.

221
00:13:53,067 --> 00:13:54,687
It seems like a good place to start.

222
00:13:55,145 --> 00:13:56,506
when we start thinking about character.

223
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:59,729
And the best part is that thinking about this first want,

224
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:01,670
excuse me, this first element,

225
00:14:01,931 --> 00:14:04,072
leads us directly to our second element.

226
00:14:04,373 --> 00:14:06,014
And that element is action.

227
00:14:06,995 --> 00:14:10,258
What do they do to get what they want?

228
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:13,501
Our protagonist has an objective.

229
00:14:14,141 --> 00:14:15,823
They're opposed by obstacles.

230
00:14:15,863 --> 00:14:17,604
They progress towards their objective,

231
00:14:18,085 --> 00:14:20,347
overcoming those obstacles through action.

232
00:14:22,718 --> 00:14:27,500
And the actions that they take, the things that they do to get what they want, those

233
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,121
tell us who that person truly is.

234
00:14:32,002 --> 00:14:37,503
If the want is the definition of a character, then the action they take in pursuit of that

235
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,284
want is what defines them as a character.

236
00:14:42,165 --> 00:14:44,146
Hamlet wants to avenge his father.

237
00:14:44,186 --> 00:14:45,006
What does he do?

238
00:14:45,406 --> 00:14:45,966
He dithers.

239
00:14:46,987 --> 00:14:48,687
And that dithering is what defines him.

240
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:54,519
Luke Skywalker wants to avenge his father and fight the Empire.

241
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:55,120
What does he do?

242
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:59,441
He becomes a Jedi like his father, maybe a bit too much like his father.

243
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:01,641
And that is the emotional conflict of this movie.

244
00:15:03,321 --> 00:15:05,262
Batman wants to avenge his parents.

245
00:15:05,302 --> 00:15:05,942
What does he do?

246
00:15:06,262 --> 00:15:08,663
He wages a never-ending crusade against crime.

247
00:15:11,743 --> 00:15:14,164
And we've heard this before, right, that character is action.

248
00:15:14,504 --> 00:15:15,364
It's an old chestnut.

249
00:15:16,224 --> 00:15:17,565
But I think it's particularly.

250
00:15:18,064 --> 00:15:25,285
applicable for games. Why? Well, because if character is action, and action is gameplay,

251
00:15:26,186 --> 00:15:33,307
well then, character is gameplay. And oh my god, is that not the best definition for character

252
00:15:33,327 --> 00:15:38,988
in video games of all time? And by the way, that's one of my problems with Gordon Freeman.

253
00:15:40,968 --> 00:15:45,729
What is Gordon's overriding action? What is the thing that Gordon Freeman, hero of the

254
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:51,936
does in every level the thing that he does time and time and time again.

255
00:15:53,437 --> 00:15:58,862
What Gordon does is what other people tell him to do.

256
00:16:01,564 --> 00:16:06,228
So what does that define Gordon's main quality as?

257
00:16:07,489 --> 00:16:08,170
Obedience.

258
00:16:10,031 --> 00:16:11,272
Yeah, there's a hero I want to be.

259
00:16:11,292 --> 00:16:14,875
I pick on Gordon.

260
00:16:15,663 --> 00:16:17,944
But this is certainly not a problem that's unique to Gordon.

261
00:16:17,964 --> 00:16:20,246
It happens with a lot of silent heroes.

262
00:16:20,306 --> 00:16:21,246
It happened in Dead Space 1.

263
00:16:21,607 --> 00:16:24,428
In fact, I used to refer to this specifically as the Isaac

264
00:16:24,468 --> 00:16:25,549
fetch my slippers problem.

265
00:16:28,371 --> 00:16:30,252
And I think it's one of the things that makes players

266
00:16:30,412 --> 00:16:33,334
disengage from story in games.

267
00:16:33,374 --> 00:16:34,715
This is the opposite of what we're

268
00:16:34,735 --> 00:16:35,675
trying to do with character.

269
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:36,816
It's the opposite of engagement.

270
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:39,277
It always makes me think of that old Farside cartoon, right?

271
00:16:40,098 --> 00:16:42,259
What we say to dogs, what dogs hear?

272
00:16:42,339 --> 00:16:43,400
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, ginger.

273
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,020
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

274
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:44,841
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

275
00:16:45,602 --> 00:16:45,922
Come on.

276
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:52,124
Alright, so our first two elements of character.

277
00:16:52,424 --> 00:16:53,304
What does the character want?

278
00:16:53,985 --> 00:16:56,125
What do they do to get what they want?

279
00:16:56,845 --> 00:16:59,206
And the third element is all the things

280
00:16:59,246 --> 00:17:00,206
I haven't talked about yet,

281
00:17:00,906 --> 00:17:03,947
which is to say all of the things that we usually think of

282
00:17:04,167 --> 00:17:05,788
when we think about character.

283
00:17:06,088 --> 00:17:07,168
We think about what they look like,

284
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:08,929
we think about where they live, how they grew up,

285
00:17:08,969 --> 00:17:10,469
who their family is, what their job is,

286
00:17:10,489 --> 00:17:12,010
their class, all of that stuff.

287
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:14,410
This isn't character.

288
00:17:15,288 --> 00:17:19,749
It is an element of character, and that element is characterization.

289
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:27,051
Who a character seems to be, what their traits are, how you would describe them.

290
00:17:27,091 --> 00:17:29,891
Not define them, but describe them.

291
00:17:31,652 --> 00:17:36,492
And the thing that's important about characterization is that characterization is external.

292
00:17:37,633 --> 00:17:41,993
It is the outward appearance that forms a shell around the character.

293
00:17:43,818 --> 00:17:47,780
And if you want to know who a character really is, you need to get past that shell.

294
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,801
You need to get to what's inside.

295
00:17:50,201 --> 00:17:52,062
Well, we can't see what's inside.

296
00:17:53,023 --> 00:17:54,283
In some games we can, but...

297
00:17:56,525 --> 00:17:59,066
what's inside the character is their want.

298
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:00,967
That comes from within.

299
00:18:02,968 --> 00:18:05,449
And want leads to action.

300
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,531
And action is external.

301
00:18:09,232 --> 00:18:12,693
So action becomes a window that lets us see past the characterization

302
00:18:13,139 --> 00:18:16,941
into the heart, into the core of who that character really is.

303
00:18:17,201 --> 00:18:19,402
And that's why when you put these three elements together,

304
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,623
you get a fully developed character.

305
00:18:22,303 --> 00:18:25,525
Who they seem to be outside, who they really are inside,

306
00:18:25,845 --> 00:18:27,206
and how we can compare the two.

307
00:18:29,507 --> 00:18:31,388
Alright, that's all well and good,

308
00:18:31,788 --> 00:18:33,989
but does any of it actually apply to games?

309
00:18:34,729 --> 00:18:35,930
Well, I think it does.

310
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:40,632
Because when we take a look back at all those different types of games

311
00:18:40,952 --> 00:18:41,993
that we looked at before...

312
00:18:43,403 --> 00:18:47,705
What we find is that not only do these three elements of character apply to games,

313
00:18:48,466 --> 00:18:51,487
they're also explanatory towards games.

314
00:18:52,508 --> 00:18:55,269
What differentiates these types of games from each other

315
00:18:56,109 --> 00:18:59,451
is who gets to decide those elements of character.

316
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:00,672
Right?

317
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:03,873
The difference between a linear game and a sandbox game

318
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:07,415
is who makes the choice about what the player does.

319
00:19:07,615 --> 00:19:09,016
In a linear game, it's the designer.

320
00:19:09,076 --> 00:19:12,377
In a sandbox game, the player has that choice.

321
00:19:13,107 --> 00:19:14,707
What do I do to get what I want?

322
00:19:16,728 --> 00:19:18,889
Now there's a spectrum there to be sure, right?

323
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:21,390
Many linear games are very wide railroads,

324
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:23,491
and many sandboxes have tracks

325
00:19:23,531 --> 00:19:24,552
running straight down the middle.

326
00:19:26,412 --> 00:19:29,334
But by and large, the difference lies in who chooses

327
00:19:29,394 --> 00:19:32,695
and how much choice you give the player as to what they do.

328
00:19:33,115 --> 00:19:35,356
Similarly with the various character types, right?

329
00:19:35,396 --> 00:19:37,117
The difference between silent, cinematic,

330
00:19:37,197 --> 00:19:39,738
and open characters lies in

331
00:19:39,858 --> 00:19:41,479
who chooses their characterization.

332
00:19:42,044 --> 00:19:44,325
In cinematic characters, that choice is made by the designers.

333
00:19:44,385 --> 00:19:46,446
In open characters, that choice is made by the player.

334
00:19:47,167 --> 00:19:50,769
And silent protagonists, well, in those cases, no one chooses.

335
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,851
Now, it's not as bad as that sounds, right?

336
00:19:54,871 --> 00:19:56,872
There's actually a very deliberate choice being made there.

337
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:59,733
The choice being made there is to create a negative space

338
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:03,776
that the player can then fill with whatever they read into it.

339
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:09,178
And this can be extremely effective, once again.

340
00:20:10,271 --> 00:20:13,493
This is a silent protagonist, but she has negative space, by and large.

341
00:20:13,513 --> 00:20:17,297
We know a couple things about her, but she's far and away the least interesting person in this family,

342
00:20:18,177 --> 00:20:19,519
from what we know in the game.

343
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,261
But we're still on board with her.

344
00:20:22,741 --> 00:20:26,565
We're still, I at least, was supremely invested in her.

345
00:20:26,945 --> 00:20:29,547
But not because of her characterization, because of her want.

346
00:20:30,869 --> 00:20:32,910
She wants to find out what happened to her sister.

347
00:20:33,251 --> 00:20:36,313
And the character work they do with the sister, the way that they establish her,

348
00:20:36,928 --> 00:20:40,109
That makes me want to know what happened to her as well.

349
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:45,950
There's the engagement, because want is the central element of character.

350
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:48,071
And this is another place where things get interesting,

351
00:20:48,631 --> 00:20:50,991
because when we look at all these varying types of games

352
00:20:51,031 --> 00:20:52,192
with all their differences,

353
00:20:52,592 --> 00:20:57,473
the choice of want is almost always made by the designers.

354
00:20:59,293 --> 00:21:02,494
Now, sometimes you get a little bit of player choice of want, right?

355
00:21:02,534 --> 00:21:04,615
Mostly in open character games or sandbox games.

356
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,482
But it's almost always at the low level.

357
00:21:06,542 --> 00:21:08,563
You don't get a choice in the high-level wants

358
00:21:09,063 --> 00:21:09,944
in these sorts of things.

359
00:21:10,284 --> 00:21:12,946
In Fable, your high-level want is established for you.

360
00:21:12,986 --> 00:21:14,287
You want to stop Lord Lucien.

361
00:21:14,808 --> 00:21:16,689
You want revenge for your sister.

362
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:21,572
The low-level wants, all of the things you want

363
00:21:21,612 --> 00:21:22,953
while you're on that quest,

364
00:21:23,254 --> 00:21:25,315
those are the things you get to make your choices about.

365
00:21:25,335 --> 00:21:26,016
Do you get married?

366
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:26,796
Do you get a job?

367
00:21:26,836 --> 00:21:27,477
Are you gonna be good?

368
00:21:27,497 --> 00:21:28,137
Are you gonna be evil?

369
00:21:28,157 --> 00:21:29,058
Are you gonna kick chickens?

370
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:31,880
Right?

371
00:21:32,781 --> 00:21:34,001
That's the stuff that you get to choose.

372
00:21:35,842 --> 00:21:39,303
Now, what's also interesting is that there is, in fact, a whole class of games

373
00:21:39,943 --> 00:21:41,763
in which the players get to decide what they want.

374
00:21:42,003 --> 00:21:43,864
Games like Minecraft, games like The Sims.

375
00:21:44,964 --> 00:21:46,305
But what's particularly interesting

376
00:21:47,165 --> 00:21:50,946
is that in almost all of those games, you're not playing a character.

377
00:21:52,106 --> 00:21:54,347
You're playing a god, or you're playing an avatar.

378
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,088
Generally not a character.

379
00:21:58,628 --> 00:22:03,030
So, because of that, they kind of fall outside the scope of a talk about character in games.

380
00:22:04,905 --> 00:22:09,148
But I thought it was worth mentioning, right, that this theory of three elements of character,

381
00:22:09,228 --> 00:22:13,190
it predicts there should be a whole range of games based around this, and sure enough,

382
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:13,691
there they are.

383
00:22:15,332 --> 00:22:16,032
All right, moving on.

384
00:22:17,954 --> 00:22:21,816
These three elements, we can see that they apply very well to an understanding of how

385
00:22:21,856 --> 00:22:25,059
to treat character in all of the different sub-genres of games.

386
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,301
So clearly this theory is applicable.

387
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:33,171
Now what about the other difficulty that we run into with character in games that I mentioned before?

388
00:22:33,411 --> 00:22:35,672
This issue of unity between player and character.

389
00:22:37,372 --> 00:22:42,153
In linear media, we don't have to worry about this. We just need to get the audience on the character's side.

390
00:22:43,213 --> 00:22:46,674
But in games, we want to take those two separate entities, and we want to make them one.

391
00:22:47,214 --> 00:22:48,635
We want to create unity between them.

392
00:22:50,575 --> 00:22:53,756
And this, of course, is why we get these negative space characters like Gordon.

393
00:22:54,056 --> 00:22:56,637
The idea is that anything that the character does...

394
00:22:57,372 --> 00:22:59,333
that the player wouldn't do anything he says,

395
00:22:59,793 --> 00:23:02,814
any opinion she expresses, any element of characterization

396
00:23:03,274 --> 00:23:06,796
that's opposed to the player will shatter that unity,

397
00:23:07,456 --> 00:23:09,197
and you end up with a non-immersive experience.

398
00:23:11,658 --> 00:23:13,759
Well, now we have a slightly different framework to use

399
00:23:13,779 --> 00:23:15,259
to think about unity.

400
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:18,880
Because if there are three defining elements of characters,

401
00:23:18,901 --> 00:23:21,201
what they want, what they do, and how they seem,

402
00:23:22,102 --> 00:23:24,743
then creating unity between player and character

403
00:23:25,661 --> 00:23:27,762
means we need to accomplish three different things.

404
00:23:27,822 --> 00:23:31,104
We need to establish three different kinds of unity.

405
00:23:32,824 --> 00:23:36,966
Unity of trait, unity of action, and unity of purpose.

406
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,928
And we need to talk about these three things each separately

407
00:23:40,968 --> 00:23:43,289
because they are not all created equal.

408
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:47,011
What happens if we don't have unity of purpose?

409
00:23:48,932 --> 00:23:51,073
If I, as the player, can't get behind

410
00:23:51,173 --> 00:23:52,454
the want of the character,

411
00:23:52,474 --> 00:23:54,615
well what happens in short?

412
00:23:55,155 --> 00:23:56,056
is we have a problem.

413
00:23:57,077 --> 00:23:57,897
Because I don't care.

414
00:23:59,899 --> 00:24:02,200
I don't care what they're going through, I don't care what they're doing,

415
00:24:02,921 --> 00:24:04,662
and that means I don't care about the story.

416
00:24:05,503 --> 00:24:06,964
I have no emotional context.

417
00:24:07,584 --> 00:24:10,126
And by and large, that means I quit.

418
00:24:11,647 --> 00:24:12,748
Right? Now here's an example.

419
00:24:13,648 --> 00:24:15,230
I want to stress this is a personal story.

420
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:18,792
In no way should anyone think this is a problem with a game.

421
00:24:19,728 --> 00:24:22,789
If anything, it's a compliment to the game, because it managed to get me role-playing

422
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:25,350
so well I screwed myself out of being able to play the game.

423
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:27,551
The original Dragon Age.

424
00:24:28,771 --> 00:24:34,673
My character was a dwarven noble, and every time there was a choice that was smug or arrogant

425
00:24:34,793 --> 00:24:37,054
or superior, I went with that particular choice.

426
00:24:38,175 --> 00:24:44,657
As a result, the way I ended up role-playing this character was as a wildly racist dwarf

427
00:24:44,937 --> 00:24:48,058
who had nothing but contempt for all non-dwarves.

428
00:24:49,118 --> 00:24:54,241
to the point that when NPCs started saying to me that bad guys are going to destroy the world,

429
00:24:54,642 --> 00:24:56,143
I actually found myself thinking,

430
00:24:56,163 --> 00:24:57,663
Pfft, not the dwarven part.

431
00:25:00,325 --> 00:25:04,407
I mean, you surface guys, you're pretty much screwed, but we're dwarves, bring them on.

432
00:25:06,829 --> 00:25:12,612
My want no longer aligned with the want that the game was pushing on me, and I couldn't play anymore.

433
00:25:14,093 --> 00:25:17,115
So I broke unity of purpose. I did that to myself.

434
00:25:18,572 --> 00:25:25,776
But nonetheless, it meant I had to stop playing a game I was enjoying, because I just wasn't engaged.

435
00:25:25,796 --> 00:25:28,178
So unity of purpose. Critical.

436
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:30,299
Now what about unity of action?

437
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,742
If we don't have unity of action, things get interesting.

438
00:25:34,222 --> 00:25:37,604
Because there's two different ways that a break in unity of action can play.

439
00:25:38,545 --> 00:25:41,147
The first way that it plays is that the player looks at it and says,

440
00:25:41,687 --> 00:25:42,627
that's not what I would do.

441
00:25:43,728 --> 00:25:44,549
Now this is a problem.

442
00:25:45,149 --> 00:25:47,731
Because basically this is a form of ludonarrative dissonance.

443
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:54,093
The story and the system are at odds with each other, and as a result, the play experience

444
00:25:54,133 --> 00:25:54,553
is broken.

445
00:25:54,833 --> 00:25:55,454
And I check out.

446
00:25:57,295 --> 00:26:01,377
And this, again, by the way, this is one of my big Gordon Freeman problems.

447
00:26:02,578 --> 00:26:04,739
Gordon and I do have unity of purpose, right?

448
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:06,220
I'm down with getting rid of the Combine.

449
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:06,841
We're good there.

450
00:26:07,761 --> 00:26:10,683
But unity of action, that's where we have a problem.

451
00:26:11,544 --> 00:26:13,765
Because Gordon doesn't do what I would do.

452
00:26:14,305 --> 00:26:15,326
What would I do?

453
00:26:15,973 --> 00:26:18,935
I would answer people who talk to me.

454
00:26:21,978 --> 00:26:26,382
These are scared, worried people who are excited to see you because you are their hero.

455
00:26:26,702 --> 00:26:28,103
And what does Gordon do?

456
00:26:28,123 --> 00:26:30,285
He gives them a cold shoulder.

457
00:26:32,487 --> 00:26:35,669
Unity of action is broken, and I'm out.

458
00:26:39,072 --> 00:26:41,654
And the problem here isn't the silence.

459
00:26:41,754 --> 00:26:43,796
It's not a silent protagonist thing.

460
00:26:45,154 --> 00:26:47,955
Because Gone Home works. And Portal works.

461
00:26:49,716 --> 00:26:53,278
Portal... Chell is my hands-down favorite silent protagonist of all time.

462
00:26:55,699 --> 00:27:00,041
But those games work because those characters don't have anyone to talk to.

463
00:27:01,721 --> 00:27:05,403
There's no violation of unity of action. In Gone Home, she's all alone.

464
00:27:05,963 --> 00:27:10,125
In Portal, GLaDOS is talking to you over the PA system, but she's not actually present.

465
00:27:11,476 --> 00:27:15,800
And by the time you are actually in the same room with her, there's really not that much left to say.

466
00:27:19,002 --> 00:27:22,305
So unity of action is preserved in Portal.

467
00:27:23,906 --> 00:27:26,749
And there's a great controlled experiment for this, which is Portal 2.

468
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:31,713
Wheatley and GLaDOS are both right there with you during a huge chunk of this game.

469
00:27:32,353 --> 00:27:35,956
And as much as I love it, as much as I love the gameplay, as much as I love the writing...

470
00:27:37,703 --> 00:27:41,106
Am I the only one who really at some point wanted to say to GLaDOS,

471
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:44,048
you know what, you're a french fry and I have a portal gun,

472
00:27:44,408 --> 00:27:45,589
I'm going to take my chances.

473
00:27:47,871 --> 00:27:48,471
But you can't.

474
00:27:50,513 --> 00:27:53,275
So Portal gives perfect unity of action.

475
00:27:53,976 --> 00:27:55,897
Challenge Portal 2, not as much.

476
00:27:59,961 --> 00:28:03,383
Now I said there were two responses to a breakdown in unity of action.

477
00:28:03,784 --> 00:28:04,965
First is I wouldn't do that.

478
00:28:05,105 --> 00:28:05,285
Second.

479
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,220
is I wouldn't do that, but my character would.

480
00:28:11,401 --> 00:28:14,182
And this one actually turns out to be okay.

481
00:28:14,402 --> 00:28:16,823
In fact, there's no better example of this in games

482
00:28:16,923 --> 00:28:19,063
than this guy, right?

483
00:28:22,745 --> 00:28:25,706
Batman and I, we totally have unity of purpose.

484
00:28:25,806 --> 00:28:28,067
He wants to stop crime, I am good with that.

485
00:28:28,847 --> 00:28:30,528
Unity of action, do we have that?

486
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:33,489
Well, what does Batman do to get what he wants?

487
00:28:41,374 --> 00:28:43,775
Now, none of these are things that I would do.

488
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:52,000
But what's awesome about the game is that I get to be Batman.

489
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,581
The fantasy is the attraction.

490
00:28:53,861 --> 00:28:56,182
So even if I wouldn't do it, he would.

491
00:28:56,783 --> 00:28:58,664
So hells yes, let's do it together.

492
00:28:59,825 --> 00:29:01,385
And that creates unity of action.

493
00:29:02,746 --> 00:29:03,887
But imagine for a moment,

494
00:29:04,747 --> 00:29:06,228
imagine that the Arkham games

495
00:29:06,955 --> 00:29:07,675
let you do this.

496
00:29:10,998 --> 00:29:12,159
Well now we have a problem.

497
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:15,481
Because killing people is not only something that I wouldn't do,

498
00:29:16,262 --> 00:29:17,542
it's something Batman wouldn't do.

499
00:29:18,983 --> 00:29:21,806
It's out of character, which breaks unity of action,

500
00:29:22,606 --> 00:29:23,046
and I quit.

501
00:29:25,268 --> 00:29:28,250
And some people have this response to the Uncharted games, right?

502
00:29:28,671 --> 00:29:31,873
As Nathan Drake, there are certain things that I expect to do. I expect to jump,

503
00:29:31,933 --> 00:29:34,255
I expect to climb, to sneak, to solve puzzles, to fight.

504
00:29:35,882 --> 00:29:37,603
What I don't expect to do with Nathan Drake

505
00:29:38,284 --> 00:29:39,384
is go on a murder spree.

506
00:29:42,187 --> 00:29:44,769
Now personally, this didn't bother me.

507
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:49,232
Right, to me it just read as an extension of the fighting.

508
00:29:50,894 --> 00:29:51,955
Body count, I didn't care.

509
00:29:52,755 --> 00:29:53,796
But I know that some people do.

510
00:29:55,217 --> 00:29:56,118
And I can see why.

511
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,961
Because it's a break in unity of action.

512
00:30:01,162 --> 00:30:03,844
And again, it's just because that doesn't seem

513
00:30:03,884 --> 00:30:05,205
like something Nathan Drake,

514
00:30:05,801 --> 00:30:09,884
would do, right? If I were playing a Gears of War game, then Murder Spree makes total

515
00:30:09,924 --> 00:30:13,907
sense. In fact, I'm not sure any other action makes sense in a Gears of War game.

516
00:30:20,452 --> 00:30:27,657
Alright. So, unity of purpose. Critical. Unity of action? Variable. Can be fatal if you break

517
00:30:27,717 --> 00:30:30,639
it, but it can also be a critical element of the fantasy to break it.

518
00:30:31,903 --> 00:30:33,624
So what about the last element, unity of trait?

519
00:30:33,744 --> 00:30:36,526
What happens if we don't have unity of trait?

520
00:30:37,606 --> 00:30:40,388
Well, as it turns out, not so much.

521
00:30:42,169 --> 00:30:44,990
Unity of trait is kind of not that important.

522
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:48,051
I mean, think about this insanely popular video game,

523
00:30:48,252 --> 00:30:48,712
Badass.

524
00:30:50,393 --> 00:30:53,554
Now, this may be the only game, the original Metroid,

525
00:30:53,814 --> 00:30:55,215
the only game I can think of that

526
00:30:55,255 --> 00:30:57,876
used a silent protagonist to establish unity of trait

527
00:30:57,916 --> 00:31:00,658
with the audience, and then deliberately

528
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:04,123
shattered unity of trait for half the audience.

529
00:31:05,784 --> 00:31:06,785
And minds were blown.

530
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:10,169
And it's not like it hurt her popularity any.

531
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:17,736
So it's OK if we don't get all the way to here,

532
00:31:17,816 --> 00:31:18,637
to unity of trait.

533
00:31:19,178 --> 00:31:21,220
It may even be OK if we don't get all the way to unity

534
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,243
of action, as long as we get to unity of purpose.

535
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:30,881
Because two people who aren't the same, who want the same things but aren't the same,

536
00:31:30,901 --> 00:31:31,902
do you know what we call them?

537
00:31:32,943 --> 00:31:34,524
We call them partners.

538
00:31:36,565 --> 00:31:39,007
And partners can work together very well.

539
00:31:39,127 --> 00:31:42,090
You don't have to be the same, you don't have to have the same worldview, you don't even

540
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:42,910
have to like each other.

541
00:31:43,851 --> 00:31:46,673
If you want the same thing, you can work with them.

542
00:31:49,055 --> 00:31:49,916
But if we end up here...

543
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:54,746
If we end up with two people who are the same, but who don't want the same thing,

544
00:31:54,766 --> 00:31:57,448
who have unity of trait, but not unity of purpose,

545
00:31:57,728 --> 00:32:00,210
you know what we call them?

546
00:32:00,231 --> 00:32:02,613
Them we usually call enemies.

547
00:32:07,577 --> 00:32:11,340
This right here, this is the real silent character problem.

548
00:32:12,461 --> 00:32:14,243
When the push for unity of trait,

549
00:32:15,303 --> 00:32:16,605
the push for seeming,

550
00:32:17,763 --> 00:32:21,085
comes at the cost of unity of purpose or unity of action.

551
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:25,828
You don't need to make me be your character.

552
00:32:26,808 --> 00:32:28,189
I just need to want to work with them.

553
00:32:31,131 --> 00:32:34,813
So, these are our three unities of character

554
00:32:35,413 --> 00:32:37,374
shown by order of importance.

555
00:32:38,395 --> 00:32:40,416
Unity of trait, largely optional.

556
00:32:41,296 --> 00:32:43,658
Unity of purpose, important but fungible.

557
00:32:43,678 --> 00:32:46,439
Excuse me, unity of action, important but fungible.

558
00:32:46,699 --> 00:32:47,420
Unity of purpose.

559
00:32:48,209 --> 00:32:49,630
that one is critical.

560
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:53,071
So these elements are so important,

561
00:32:54,451 --> 00:32:55,172
let's get practical.

562
00:32:55,212 --> 00:32:55,992
How do we establish them?

563
00:32:56,012 --> 00:32:58,093
Well, there are a lot of different techniques

564
00:32:58,113 --> 00:33:00,714
that one can use to establish these various types of unity

565
00:33:00,734 --> 00:33:01,094
in games.

566
00:33:02,734 --> 00:33:05,736
Each subgenre, of course, has some of its own unique

567
00:33:05,756 --> 00:33:07,096
requirements, but I do think that there

568
00:33:07,116 --> 00:33:09,697
are some best practices that apply across all of them.

569
00:33:09,997 --> 00:33:11,498
So let's talk about unity of trait first.

570
00:33:12,338 --> 00:33:14,759
Now, I just said that you don't need it, but it's nice.

571
00:33:15,819 --> 00:33:16,580
It can create.

572
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:22,174
identification with a character. If it's open, it can create agency. It can create ownership

573
00:33:22,675 --> 00:33:26,298
for a character. And these are both forms of engagement. So if we can get there, it's

574
00:33:26,358 --> 00:33:28,681
nice. But if we can't, let's not break our backs.

575
00:33:29,542 --> 00:33:32,645
So how do we establish unity of trait? Well, let's look at each of our three different

576
00:33:32,745 --> 00:33:37,650
types of characters. For silent characters, we don't establish unity of trait. We establish

577
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:39,191
nothing. That's what they're there for.

578
00:33:40,693 --> 00:33:41,654
For cinematic characters...

579
00:33:42,764 --> 00:33:45,106
We also don't establish unity of trait.

580
00:33:45,126 --> 00:33:46,567
We just let them be themselves,

581
00:33:46,967 --> 00:33:47,968
and we get to be their partners.

582
00:33:49,148 --> 00:33:51,930
Although, by the way, as long as we're on the topic,

583
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:54,012
I'd just like to say that given that unity of trait

584
00:33:54,292 --> 00:33:56,413
isn't as important as everyone seems to think,

585
00:33:56,914 --> 00:33:58,655
maybe we could share it a little bit

586
00:33:59,055 --> 00:34:00,356
with people who don't look like this.

587
00:34:02,618 --> 00:34:02,838
All right.

588
00:34:03,999 --> 00:34:06,080
Our last type of character, open characters, right?

589
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,781
Where the player gets to decide who their character is.

590
00:34:07,821 --> 00:34:09,382
How do we establish unity of trait here?

591
00:34:09,402 --> 00:34:11,884
Well, that's pretty well a solved problem.

592
00:34:13,672 --> 00:34:14,492
So that's unity of trait.

593
00:34:15,772 --> 00:34:16,633
How about unity of action?

594
00:34:17,093 --> 00:34:18,373
Things get a little bit more interesting here.

595
00:34:19,734 --> 00:34:22,475
Are two different types of games that are differentiated by action,

596
00:34:22,555 --> 00:34:23,795
linear and sandbox, right?

597
00:34:23,855 --> 00:34:27,156
Both have very different requirements in this case.

598
00:34:27,556 --> 00:34:30,277
But in both cases, the easiest way to determine

599
00:34:30,297 --> 00:34:34,519
if what you're doing is going to help maintain unity of action is the same.

600
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:36,759
It's ask yourself one simple question.

601
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,440
What would I do?

602
00:34:40,261 --> 00:34:42,902
Does this action make sense to me or to my character?

603
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:44,212
given the situation.

604
00:34:44,232 --> 00:34:51,074
And once you've got unity of action, maintaining it, particularly in a sandbox game, it's usually

605
00:34:51,114 --> 00:34:53,695
pretty easy because we let the player choose what they want to do.

606
00:34:54,696 --> 00:34:57,437
If they don't think their character would do something, then they don't do it.

607
00:34:58,357 --> 00:35:02,998
The tricky bit here is just making sure you've got your bases covered enough, right, so that

608
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:05,419
you've got most of the wants that people want.

609
00:35:05,439 --> 00:35:06,360
And that's what playtesting is.

610
00:35:08,265 --> 00:35:13,547
Now, in linear games, where the player doesn't get to choose, where the designer tells the player what it is that they're going to do,

611
00:35:13,567 --> 00:35:16,967
there are a couple of different techniques to use to establish unity here.

612
00:35:17,387 --> 00:35:20,468
First and foremost, and I cannot stress this enough,

613
00:35:21,428 --> 00:35:23,789
don't make them do anything that's stupid.

614
00:35:23,809 --> 00:35:29,390
And this is a real pitfall, particularly in games, right?

615
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:32,271
Because sometimes somebody comes up with some really cool gameplay,

616
00:35:32,591 --> 00:35:35,112
but there's no narrative reason for it.

617
00:35:35,505 --> 00:35:41,089
So they just slap together some half-assed excuse, and you get a tortured story.

618
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:44,432
Players look at this and think, wait, what am I doing? Why am I doing this?

619
00:35:45,453 --> 00:35:47,234
That's the opposite of engagement.

620
00:35:49,736 --> 00:35:51,958
Now, the other thing that you need to do to establish unity of action

621
00:35:51,978 --> 00:35:56,902
is that you need to make sure that you have already secured unity of purpose.

622
00:35:58,263 --> 00:35:59,864
Action comes out of want.

623
00:36:01,085 --> 00:36:03,868
And nine times out of ten, if you're violating unity of action,

624
00:36:04,273 --> 00:36:08,636
It is probably because the player isn't on board with the same want that you're pushing.

625
00:36:09,356 --> 00:36:12,018
Now, this was something that happened to me in the original Dead Space.

626
00:36:14,359 --> 00:36:16,980
And this game did a fantastic job of establishing want.

627
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,601
I absolutely had unity of purpose.

628
00:36:19,842 --> 00:36:23,644
I wanted off that ship.

629
00:36:24,664 --> 00:36:29,447
So I go to hell and back in order to try to fix a shuttlecraft so we can get the hell

630
00:36:29,647 --> 00:36:30,147
out of there.

631
00:36:30,267 --> 00:36:32,808
We had unity of action on that front, too.

632
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,981
And then I meet this guy.

633
00:36:36,801 --> 00:36:40,844
This guy who's still alive on a ship full of people

634
00:36:40,864 --> 00:36:42,504
where everyone else who's still alive

635
00:36:42,524 --> 00:36:44,325
is entirely batshit crazy.

636
00:36:45,126 --> 00:36:50,769
And this guy says to me, you know, maybe, just maybe,

637
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:52,450
I'm just throwing this out here,

638
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:54,771
I know you fixed that shuttle

639
00:36:54,831 --> 00:36:55,791
because what you really want to do

640
00:36:55,852 --> 00:36:56,692
is get the hell out of here.

641
00:36:56,752 --> 00:36:57,973
But I was thinking that maybe

642
00:36:58,253 --> 00:36:59,674
instead of getting the hell out of here,

643
00:36:59,714 --> 00:37:00,374
what you could do...

644
00:37:01,027 --> 00:37:05,629
is take this giant, obviously evil artifact that we think was probably the cause of this

645
00:37:05,669 --> 00:37:08,970
whole mess, take it down to the planet below, and just kind of put it back where we found it.

646
00:37:16,532 --> 00:37:16,892
Boom.

647
00:37:19,593 --> 00:37:22,974
That is not what I wanted to do. I wanted to get out.

648
00:37:24,874 --> 00:37:26,635
So a disconnect in unity of purpose,

649
00:37:28,316 --> 00:37:29,556
disconnect in the want,

650
00:37:30,865 --> 00:37:33,447
caused a disconnect in unity of action, right?

651
00:37:33,548 --> 00:37:34,488
What actually happened?

652
00:37:34,508 --> 00:37:35,609
Well, Isaac went ahead and said,

653
00:37:35,629 --> 00:37:36,350
oh, yep.

654
00:37:37,791 --> 00:37:38,732
What did I want to say?

655
00:37:38,752 --> 00:37:39,632
I wanted to say this.

656
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,697
Nine times out of 10, problems with unity of action

657
00:37:45,817 --> 00:37:47,679
are really problems with unity of purpose.

658
00:37:47,859 --> 00:37:49,240
So, that being the case,

659
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,542
let's talk about how we establish unity of purpose.

660
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:54,224
And this takes us back to our definition of character,

661
00:37:54,264 --> 00:37:55,765
someone who wants something badly.

662
00:37:57,427 --> 00:37:58,147
Now, as this suggests,

663
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:01,091
There are two components to unity of purpose.

664
00:38:01,971 --> 00:38:02,591
What do we want?

665
00:38:03,792 --> 00:38:04,592
And why do we care?

666
00:38:06,232 --> 00:38:07,293
And this last part is critical.

667
00:38:07,513 --> 00:38:09,833
It's not enough just to get the player on board

668
00:38:09,873 --> 00:38:10,894
with the character's want.

669
00:38:11,514 --> 00:38:14,635
You have to get the player to want it badly.

670
00:38:14,955 --> 00:38:16,095
You have to make them care.

671
00:38:17,535 --> 00:38:19,836
And this is where we talk about creating empathy in games.

672
00:38:19,856 --> 00:38:21,096
This is where we talk about the feels,

673
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:24,277
making the player and the character share feelings.

674
00:38:25,787 --> 00:38:30,490
Now for my money, there is no better example in games of establishing unity of purpose

675
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:32,551
than the opening minutes of this game.

676
00:38:33,032 --> 00:38:38,855
So let's take a look at the first minute and 13 seconds and see what they do.

677
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:14,676
That's my blood.

678
00:39:15,337 --> 00:39:15,897
That's my blood.

679
00:39:15,917 --> 00:39:17,259
That's a lot of my blood.

680
00:39:52,736 --> 00:40:03,840
Okay. Is anybody here not clear on the want? Anybody here not on board with the want? Right?

681
00:40:04,688 --> 00:40:05,629
This is a great example.

682
00:40:05,649 --> 00:40:07,390
And by the way, in that minute and 13 seconds,

683
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:09,351
they spend like the first 20 seconds on that quote,

684
00:40:09,391 --> 00:40:10,071
which does nothing.

685
00:40:10,972 --> 00:40:12,052
So how do they pull this off, right?

686
00:40:12,173 --> 00:40:14,614
How do they create this degree of unity?

687
00:40:15,194 --> 00:40:15,955
Well, the first thing they do,

688
00:40:15,975 --> 00:40:17,315
we start on the inside of the trade.

689
00:40:18,316 --> 00:40:21,017
And what are we as the player thinking in that moment?

690
00:40:21,618 --> 00:40:23,259
We're thinking, what is this?

691
00:40:23,419 --> 00:40:24,499
What's happening here, right?

692
00:40:24,519 --> 00:40:26,360
And then we cut to Nate.

693
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,601
And what's the very first thing that he says?

694
00:40:29,982 --> 00:40:30,623
What's going on?

695
00:40:30,643 --> 00:40:34,525
Well, that's exactly what we're thinking.

696
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:39,181
So we're sharing thoughts. We don't know where he is. He doesn't know either.

697
00:40:39,281 --> 00:40:41,542
We are in the same boat together.

698
00:40:42,722 --> 00:40:46,103
And this is a technique that I like to call sharing is caring.

699
00:40:47,844 --> 00:40:49,665
This is the easiest way to create empathy, right?

700
00:40:49,745 --> 00:40:53,446
By sharing something between player and character, right?

701
00:40:53,766 --> 00:40:59,268
It can be a thought, having the character say what it is that the player is thinking.

702
00:41:00,328 --> 00:41:02,629
It can be a mystery or a secret, right?

703
00:41:03,228 --> 00:41:04,848
This is the princess bride moment.

704
00:41:04,968 --> 00:41:06,489
I am not left-handed, right?

705
00:41:06,809 --> 00:41:08,890
We knew that, so we have a shared moment.

706
00:41:11,711 --> 00:41:16,233
Shared emotion, make them feel what the character

707
00:41:16,293 --> 00:41:17,273
is feeling, right?

708
00:41:17,413 --> 00:41:18,473
If it's possible in your game,

709
00:41:18,493 --> 00:41:20,334
depending on the type of game, shared choices.

710
00:41:21,074 --> 00:41:22,715
Or it's a moment where it feels like the player

711
00:41:22,775 --> 00:41:23,835
is turning to you and saying,

712
00:41:23,975 --> 00:41:24,916
yeah, I don't know, what do you think?

713
00:41:27,137 --> 00:41:29,757
And maybe my favorite way to get players

714
00:41:29,878 --> 00:41:32,158
and characters sharing in games is this.

715
00:41:33,095 --> 00:41:34,576
shared experiences.

716
00:41:36,217 --> 00:41:38,679
Because interactivity, experientiality,

717
00:41:39,339 --> 00:41:40,540
that's the art of games.

718
00:41:41,821 --> 00:41:43,481
In film, we say show, don't tell.

719
00:41:43,782 --> 00:41:45,743
In games, we say do, don't show.

720
00:41:47,324 --> 00:41:50,105
And you can use gameplay to create empathy.

721
00:41:50,366 --> 00:41:52,927
Heavy Rain does a fantastic job of this, right?

722
00:41:53,227 --> 00:41:55,649
Your want in this game, Ethan's want, I should say,

723
00:41:55,929 --> 00:41:57,049
is to save his children.

724
00:41:57,490 --> 00:41:59,011
What does he do to get what he wants?

725
00:41:59,731 --> 00:42:00,612
That's what the game's about.

726
00:42:01,888 --> 00:42:03,829
You get to decide how far he'll go.

727
00:42:03,869 --> 00:42:05,330
Will you crawl through broken glass?

728
00:42:05,611 --> 00:42:06,971
Will you chop off your own finger?

729
00:42:07,292 --> 00:42:09,593
Will you pull the trigger on another human being?

730
00:42:11,274 --> 00:42:12,995
Well, none of those questions mean anything

731
00:42:13,135 --> 00:42:16,618
if you don't want to save his children badly.

732
00:42:17,378 --> 00:42:18,959
So they have to get you on board with that.

733
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,220
And how do they do that?

734
00:42:21,161 --> 00:42:22,762
They let you play with his kids.

735
00:42:24,683 --> 00:42:28,085
You play Ethan's love for his children.

736
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:29,987
And that's what makes you care.

737
00:42:32,156 --> 00:42:33,457
All right, back to Uncharted.

738
00:42:34,899 --> 00:42:36,000
The next trick that they use,

739
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,662
after sharing a thought, right?

740
00:42:39,062 --> 00:42:40,564
Nate realizes that he's been shot.

741
00:42:41,144 --> 00:42:43,627
He looks down, he's covered in his own blood, right?

742
00:42:43,967 --> 00:42:46,229
That's my blood, that's a lot of my blood.

743
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:47,530
What does this do?

744
00:42:47,811 --> 00:42:49,032
Well, it makes him an underdog.

745
00:42:50,033 --> 00:42:51,014
And the thing about underdogs

746
00:42:51,594 --> 00:42:54,857
is that everybody loves an underdog, right?

747
00:42:54,998 --> 00:42:55,658
So what does this do?

748
00:42:56,239 --> 00:42:57,220
It's a trick to make him likable.

749
00:42:58,518 --> 00:43:04,141
And it's another great way to get people to be on board with your character, to care about them, to engage with them, make them likable.

750
00:43:04,961 --> 00:43:08,523
Let them be an underdog. Let them be funny. Let them be like someone who makes them laugh.

751
00:43:09,203 --> 00:43:10,904
Let them be noble. Let them be admirable.

752
00:43:11,624 --> 00:43:15,406
Make them sympathetic, someone that we feel for, not just feel with.

753
00:43:17,067 --> 00:43:20,929
Because the more that the player likes the character, the more that they want to be partners with them.

754
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:25,131
So let's walk through the rest of that opening, right?

755
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:28,417
Next thing that happens, at the same time that Nate does,

756
00:43:28,857 --> 00:43:31,038
we realize the train is hanging on its side.

757
00:43:31,639 --> 00:43:34,461
And in that moment, bam, something falls on top of us.

758
00:43:34,821 --> 00:43:36,402
Another shared emotion, surprise.

759
00:43:38,123 --> 00:43:40,544
Then he falls down the back of the train, right?

760
00:43:40,704 --> 00:43:42,846
He slams into the rail as he falls.

761
00:43:43,366 --> 00:43:44,827
Ow, that looks painful.

762
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:45,507
Whoops.

763
00:43:46,768 --> 00:43:46,988
Right?

764
00:43:47,628 --> 00:43:49,470
Sympathy, poor boy, that hurt.

765
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:52,011
And then my favorite bit,

766
00:43:52,311 --> 00:43:53,772
he's hanging off the bottom of the train.

767
00:43:54,225 --> 00:43:57,528
I don't know if you could hear this on the audio, but what does he do hanging on the bottom of the train?

768
00:43:58,488 --> 00:43:59,009
He laughs.

769
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:01,470
He laughs and he says,

770
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:02,671
Ha ha, crap.

771
00:44:04,612 --> 00:44:04,853
Right?

772
00:44:06,153 --> 00:44:07,374
And this is all of the above.

773
00:44:07,855 --> 00:44:09,696
First of all, it's likability, because he's funny.

774
00:44:10,797 --> 00:44:13,158
And second off, it's a shared joke.

775
00:44:13,899 --> 00:44:15,900
Because he's thinking, I can't believe this,

776
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,322
at the same time that we're thinking, can you believe that?

777
00:44:20,363 --> 00:44:21,404
So boom, we're there.

778
00:44:22,444 --> 00:44:23,785
We're thinking what he's thinking.

779
00:44:25,326 --> 00:44:27,688
And then we finally get to his want.

780
00:44:28,348 --> 00:44:30,250
What is his want? To not die.

781
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:33,652
That's a pretty easy one to grok as these things go.

782
00:44:35,053 --> 00:44:37,134
And that's another great trick and another great take-home

783
00:44:37,154 --> 00:44:39,436
when it comes to establishing unity of purpose.

784
00:44:39,996 --> 00:44:41,177
Keep it simple.

785
00:44:42,158 --> 00:44:44,360
If the player can't understand the want,

786
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,182
then the player is not going to share the want.

787
00:44:47,922 --> 00:44:51,264
Plus as a bonus, the more basic, the more elemental the want,

788
00:44:51,304 --> 00:44:53,226
the less time you have to spend establishing it.

789
00:44:53,673 --> 00:44:55,374
Unless you run into exposition overload.

790
00:44:56,295 --> 00:45:00,238
Survive. Avenge. Escape. Avoid. Acquire.

791
00:45:01,439 --> 00:45:03,140
These are all very elemental wants.

792
00:45:03,981 --> 00:45:05,422
Very easy for people to get.

793
00:45:09,725 --> 00:45:12,227
So that's unity of purpose. Establish what they want.

794
00:45:12,808 --> 00:45:13,908
Establish why we care.

795
00:45:15,089 --> 00:45:17,131
By and large, you've built unity of purpose.

796
00:45:19,393 --> 00:45:22,895
So, that's what I got as far as things to talk about.

797
00:45:23,697 --> 00:45:27,178
I hope I have managed to convince you all to hate this guy as much as I do.

798
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:29,739
Any questions?

799
00:45:29,759 --> 00:45:43,685
There are microphones up at the front.

800
00:45:43,945 --> 00:45:45,526
Yeah.

801
00:45:46,266 --> 00:45:46,447
Hi.

802
00:45:46,707 --> 00:45:48,728
It's more of an opinion on your part, but...

803
00:45:50,008 --> 00:45:54,030
Going through my head while you've been explaining all this, I've been trying to figure out how

804
00:45:54,771 --> 00:45:57,913
the original Bioshock's character Jack kind of fits into it, because there just seems

805
00:45:57,933 --> 00:46:02,536
to be a lot of pros and cons for that character that you've talked about, but just your opinion

806
00:46:02,656 --> 00:46:04,777
on him.

807
00:46:08,039 --> 00:46:13,162
He's not my favorite silent character, but I think he works pretty well.

808
00:46:13,923 --> 00:46:14,943
It's a little...

809
00:46:15,864 --> 00:46:19,066
They have a kind of kludgy excuse for why he never responds.

810
00:46:20,547 --> 00:46:23,009
but you don't know that for a huge chunk of the game.

811
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:26,272
And so I think you kind of have to put your,

812
00:46:26,292 --> 00:46:29,134
eh, it's a silent protagonist, I'll roll with it hat on.

813
00:46:30,215 --> 00:46:32,617
And then you get that surprise later on, which is,

814
00:46:32,897 --> 00:46:36,180
oh, wait, hang on, this is not, you know, this is actually intentional.

815
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:38,742
So he works, he works all right, but I think there are moments

816
00:46:38,762 --> 00:46:40,664
where you definitely have that disconnect of like,

817
00:46:40,704 --> 00:46:44,887
why am I just standing here and not having any kind of agency in this conversation?

818
00:46:45,328 --> 00:46:46,529
Yep, thank you.

819
00:46:46,629 --> 00:46:46,829
Thank you.

820
00:46:48,223 --> 00:46:54,685
Hi, I kind of have a similar question to what he stated, but it's about another Naughty Dog game, The Last of Us.

821
00:46:55,905 --> 00:47:03,887
Without conveying any spoilers, I think that's a pretty good example of a change in the unity of purpose with what the player thinks.

822
00:47:05,107 --> 00:47:12,189
I'm just wondering if, because it's something so ingrained in what the character would do, if that makes it okay, in your opinion.

823
00:47:12,209 --> 00:47:15,830
Yeah, I mean, I think that...

824
00:47:18,892 --> 00:47:25,075
I think that even when the actions in that game are not what the player would do, I think

825
00:47:25,135 --> 00:47:29,337
that you look at them and you say, yeah, but that's totally something the character would

826
00:47:29,377 --> 00:47:29,497
do.

827
00:47:30,318 --> 00:47:35,140
And I mean, I've spoken to people who have said in so many words, like, I really didn't

828
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:40,523
want to do it, but I couldn't begrudge, you know, so yeah, I mean, I think that works.

829
00:47:42,770 --> 00:47:49,796
Regarding establishing unity of purpose, like we all know that how like different things about games affect different people in different ways

830
00:47:50,176 --> 00:47:55,340
Like a friend of mine like I personally liked Gone Home, but a friend of mine called it a walking simulator

831
00:47:55,861 --> 00:48:02,466
So is there like any like golden rule of making and making the casting a net wide enough?

832
00:48:02,606 --> 00:48:06,029
Or is it just something that's just stumbling in the dark?

833
00:48:06,287 --> 00:48:09,569
I mean, I think that's a decision that you need to make project to project is,

834
00:48:09,749 --> 00:48:13,350
are you going to try to appeal, are you going to try to be all things to all people?

835
00:48:14,151 --> 00:48:19,313
I think from the way that I phrased that answer, I think you can tell what my opinion on that is,

836
00:48:19,353 --> 00:48:20,273
which is that it's madness.

837
00:48:21,254 --> 00:48:26,936
You know, I think Gone Home in particular, I think, was going to run into problems from people who,

838
00:48:27,137 --> 00:48:31,538
it's an expectation management problem, people who went in expecting a conventional video game

839
00:48:31,579 --> 00:48:32,739
are going to be disappointed.

840
00:48:34,174 --> 00:48:35,674
And that's true with anything.

841
00:48:35,714 --> 00:48:40,575
If you have huge expectations for something and you come in and it completely subverts them,

842
00:48:40,895 --> 00:48:42,415
that's often a very disappointing experience.

843
00:48:43,655 --> 00:48:46,216
So I think that's a unique and interesting edge case.

844
00:48:47,736 --> 00:48:52,537
But, yeah, I think if you get someone on board with the want,

845
00:48:52,597 --> 00:48:54,978
if they want what the character wants, then they're going to be invested.

846
00:48:55,038 --> 00:48:56,898
That's fundamentally what it all comes down to.

847
00:48:57,118 --> 00:48:57,438
Thank you.

848
00:48:57,638 --> 00:48:57,878
Thank you.

849
00:48:57,898 --> 00:48:59,898
Anyone else?

850
00:49:04,172 --> 00:49:09,796
Could you tell us some characters you loved, dramas, TV, or anything?

851
00:49:10,336 --> 00:49:10,696
Games?

852
00:49:11,637 --> 00:49:12,657
Well, certainly Walter White.

853
00:49:13,918 --> 00:49:16,440
I think from Breaking Bad is one of the most...

854
00:49:17,681 --> 00:49:22,644
I will freely admit that I maybe felt like I identified with him a little more than I'm

855
00:49:22,664 --> 00:49:24,465
comfortable with.

856
00:49:26,786 --> 00:49:29,228
But he's a great example.

857
00:49:29,288 --> 00:49:30,749
One of the things, especially in linear media...

858
00:49:31,328 --> 00:49:34,049
It's harder to apply to games, but it's not untrue in games, right?

859
00:49:34,109 --> 00:49:35,970
One of the things that makes characters really interesting

860
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:39,772
is when you have maximum contrast between their characterization

861
00:49:40,232 --> 00:49:42,193
and the actions that they take, right?

862
00:49:42,233 --> 00:49:43,654
So you look at someone like Walter White.

863
00:49:43,694 --> 00:49:46,855
He's characterized as a meek chemistry teacher.

864
00:49:47,435 --> 00:49:48,236
What does he want?

865
00:49:48,496 --> 00:49:50,517
He wants success or money, depending on how you argue it.

866
00:49:50,557 --> 00:49:51,257
What does he do?

867
00:49:51,757 --> 00:49:55,079
He becomes a meth kingpin and runs a crushing drug empire.

868
00:49:56,339 --> 00:49:59,541
Meek chemistry teacher, crushing drug empire.

869
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:04,781
that's an interesting character. And it's consistent. It makes sense.

870
00:50:05,521 --> 00:50:06,642
You know, you see that in

871
00:50:07,643 --> 00:50:11,186
characterization in...GLaDOS is actually another great example. One of the reasons

872
00:50:11,226 --> 00:50:12,127
GLaDOS works so well.

873
00:50:12,527 --> 00:50:16,130
Especially early on. I mean, everybody knows that GLaDOS is a homicidal lunatic now,

874
00:50:16,290 --> 00:50:20,013
right? But when you first start playing that game, she's cold, she's clinical, she's robotic,

875
00:50:20,494 --> 00:50:23,817
right? She comes across characterized

876
00:50:24,337 --> 00:50:27,540
as a machine, as something, a logical being of science, right?

877
00:50:27,908 --> 00:50:32,510
And it takes a while, and about the time she starts to try to set you on fire, when you

878
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:35,051
realize no, this is actually a passive-aggressive murder machine.

879
00:50:36,051 --> 00:50:37,611
That's what makes her such an interesting character.

880
00:50:37,711 --> 00:50:41,953
So those are the things that I look for when I'm creating characters and when I'm looking

881
00:50:41,993 --> 00:50:43,133
for what media I'm going to consume.

882
00:50:44,353 --> 00:50:47,194
So I have a question about sidekicks and other side characters.

883
00:50:47,694 --> 00:50:52,796
Sometimes you have all units of action and trait and everything with your main character,

884
00:50:53,196 --> 00:50:57,017
but sometimes when he is interacting with other NPCs and other characters.

885
00:50:57,929 --> 00:51:02,130
sometimes can the main character like another NPC that the player hates,

886
00:51:02,170 --> 00:51:07,311
like that kind of mascot that is really annoying but the main character really likes,

887
00:51:07,371 --> 00:51:10,711
that can help to break any kind of unity?

888
00:51:11,331 --> 00:51:18,193
Yeah, that is, I would argue that's a problem in terms of what your sidekick does.

889
00:51:19,293 --> 00:51:22,733
When it comes to what do they do to get what they want, if what they do to get what they want,

890
00:51:22,833 --> 00:51:26,154
even inadvertently, is annoy the crap out of everyone around them.

891
00:51:26,904 --> 00:51:29,825
I would consider that a poor choice on the designer's part.

892
00:51:31,406 --> 00:51:35,249
So it's a good question.

893
00:51:35,529 --> 00:51:38,511
Yeah, my question is mostly regarding multiplayer games

894
00:51:38,611 --> 00:51:40,032
or cooperative games.

895
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:44,315
I'd like to take the example of Journey, which in my opinion,

896
00:51:44,635 --> 00:51:48,477
works with Hero's Journey in a very interesting way,

897
00:51:48,497 --> 00:51:50,219
because usually the first time you're playing,

898
00:51:50,699 --> 00:51:52,940
you're like the hero, so you don't know what to do.

899
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,761
And then you find a mentor around,

900
00:51:54,822 --> 00:51:55,782
which is the other player.

901
00:51:56,454 --> 00:51:59,495
And after you finish the game and play again, you become the mentor.

902
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:03,638
So in the gameplay, they found a way, an amazing way, in my opinion,

903
00:52:03,678 --> 00:52:07,920
to kind of close that cycle and make you feel that journey.

904
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:12,162
And I mean, in this case, it was a brilliant solution for that kind of gameplay.

905
00:52:12,743 --> 00:52:13,743
It matches very well.

906
00:52:13,823 --> 00:52:17,145
But I was wondering of other types of cooperative gameplays,

907
00:52:17,345 --> 00:52:25,250
how do you do to make all the characters seem and look as important as, I don't know, the hero?

908
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:25,890
Mm-hmm.

909
00:52:26,578 --> 00:52:30,120
Well I think, I mean one of my favorite examples of establishing character through gameplay

910
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:31,621
is also the Left 4 Dead games.

911
00:52:32,522 --> 00:52:33,942
And they do that through the enemy design.

912
00:52:34,203 --> 00:52:39,526
Because there are multiple types of enemies that you cannot defeat on your own.

913
00:52:39,546 --> 00:52:44,009
The ones who pull you away from the group, my favorite, what are they called, the Belchers?

914
00:52:44,069 --> 00:52:49,552
Where they vomit on you and you go blind and all of the zombies in the area come running

915
00:52:49,612 --> 00:52:50,193
towards you.

916
00:52:51,153 --> 00:52:54,395
That mechanic would be unconscionable in a single player game.

917
00:52:55,486 --> 00:52:58,929
But because you are dependent on other people to survive,

918
00:52:59,549 --> 00:53:03,552
it creates an emotional connection between you as characters,

919
00:53:04,193 --> 00:53:05,554
or between you as players, I guess.

920
00:53:05,574 --> 00:53:09,577
I mean, that's a game where trait is pretty minimal in that game,

921
00:53:09,897 --> 00:53:13,920
but want and purpose, those two things, I think you create a great degree of unity.

922
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:16,082
If I'm not working with these people, I'm going to die.

923
00:53:16,462 --> 00:53:18,224
Therefore, what do I do? I work with these people.

924
00:53:18,844 --> 00:53:19,845
All right. Thank you.

925
00:53:22,147 --> 00:53:28,411
So it's typical to say in TV or movies that a character has a fatal flaw.

926
00:53:28,912 --> 00:53:33,335
And for a lot of it, because they're outside, you're not their avatar.

927
00:53:34,196 --> 00:53:37,698
You know, you can watch them do horrible things,

928
00:53:38,219 --> 00:53:42,402
and you can root for the difference between what someone wants and what they need.

929
00:53:43,122 --> 00:53:47,005
Can you speak a little bit to how character flaws work in video games?

930
00:53:48,853 --> 00:53:53,577
Character flaws are tricky in video games. They're easiest in cinematic games like Uncharted, right?

931
00:53:53,617 --> 00:53:58,521
And that's, you know, Drake pulls off a perfect arc in that perspective.

932
00:53:59,141 --> 00:54:00,502
But they're easiest because you can script it.

933
00:54:01,563 --> 00:54:06,827
When you're dealing with flaws with characters in video games,

934
00:54:07,408 --> 00:54:11,591
because the player, to some extent, is getting to choose what they do,

935
00:54:12,012 --> 00:54:14,514
you know, the question with a fatal flaw is always,

936
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:18,136
do I succumb to my flaw or do I overcome my flaw, right?

937
00:54:18,553 --> 00:54:22,554
And that becomes a choice for the player to make in most games that try to deal with that.

938
00:54:22,994 --> 00:54:27,896
Now there's one way you can do that. You can do that explicitly, right?

939
00:54:27,916 --> 00:54:30,517
Which is pretty much what Fable 2 does, right?

940
00:54:30,997 --> 00:54:34,618
When all is said and done, you have a choice. Do you save the dog or do you save...

941
00:54:34,638 --> 00:54:37,599
or do you take the money, right?

942
00:54:37,899 --> 00:54:41,881
That's a question to ask. Who are you and what's really important to you? What are you going to do?

943
00:54:42,261 --> 00:54:43,481
But they make that explicit.

944
00:54:44,121 --> 00:54:46,882
In lots of games, that stuff becomes implicit.

945
00:54:47,262 --> 00:54:48,263
And when it's implicit...

946
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:52,761
this choice between whether I'm gonna shoot someone in the face or not, right?

947
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:57,803
A lot of times it passes unnoticed by the players. There's no question there, you know?

948
00:54:58,343 --> 00:55:03,845
And that to me is a problem. So I think fatal flaws can work, but they're tricky.

949
00:55:05,525 --> 00:55:10,007
And you need to make sure that the player understands the choice that they're making.

950
00:55:10,547 --> 00:55:15,989
You know, you need to make that a dramatic moment for the player and not let that be something that's thrown away in the heat of combat.

951
00:55:16,009 --> 00:55:18,150
Do we have time for one more question?

952
00:55:19,587 --> 00:55:20,507
Yes, all right.

953
00:55:22,889 --> 00:55:23,709
So, um,

954
00:55:25,490 --> 00:55:26,671
one of the major things

955
00:55:26,751 --> 00:55:28,892
about the unity of purpose I've noticed

956
00:55:29,032 --> 00:55:29,413
was

957
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:32,995
one game that I played, the Legend of Dragoon,

958
00:55:33,815 --> 00:55:34,736
the main character

959
00:55:34,756 --> 00:55:37,257
had a purpose,

960
00:55:37,278 --> 00:55:38,598
a unity of purpose, and I

961
00:55:38,618 --> 00:55:40,680
could relate to this purpose because

962
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:42,601
despite it being a very

963
00:55:42,621 --> 00:55:45,202
I don't want to say evil,

964
00:55:45,242 --> 00:55:46,063
but very, like,

965
00:55:46,783 --> 00:55:47,764
vengeful, because

966
00:55:48,747 --> 00:55:52,488
He basically, the main character, wanted to avenge the death of his parents

967
00:55:53,108 --> 00:55:56,849
by killing the very thing that did this action.

968
00:55:58,650 --> 00:56:01,731
And despite it being a very heinous act on my part,

969
00:56:01,971 --> 00:56:04,652
like something I wouldn't normally do or anything like that,

970
00:56:05,072 --> 00:56:08,673
but I could relate to it and understand that what my question is

971
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:13,134
later on down the road, the character gets to the point of

972
00:56:13,895 --> 00:56:15,615
finding out who this character is.

973
00:56:17,012 --> 00:56:21,434
And it turns out it's someone that has been close to him and has been like a friend to him,

974
00:56:21,514 --> 00:56:23,254
if not one of his closest friends of all time.

975
00:56:25,095 --> 00:56:31,016
The want, is it a good thing to change the unity of purpose

976
00:56:31,797 --> 00:56:38,599
because the unity of action would prevent him from accomplishing the original unity of purpose?

977
00:56:40,179 --> 00:56:42,340
Well, what you're talking about is changing his want.

978
00:56:42,898 --> 00:56:47,301
Yes. Right? So you've got unity of purpose, the two of you are together, and all of a sudden he jumps to the left.

979
00:56:48,162 --> 00:56:51,224
Right? The question is whether or not you move with him.

980
00:56:52,305 --> 00:56:54,747
Right? If you stay behind, that was the dead space problem.

981
00:56:54,767 --> 00:56:58,289
Yeah. Because all of a sudden Isaac wanted to go down to the planet, and I was still like,

982
00:56:58,409 --> 00:57:00,811
No! Call the Marines, for crying out loud.

983
00:57:00,911 --> 00:57:03,132
Right? I'm an engineer. I'm not going to fix this.

984
00:57:03,693 --> 00:57:06,054
Right? So the question is whether or not you can make that leap with them.

985
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:07,435
If you can...

986
00:57:08,386 --> 00:57:12,189
then it's perfectly fine to all of a sudden say, you know what, this is what we wanted all along,

987
00:57:12,229 --> 00:57:15,632
but oh my god, I want this other thing more now, and so that's what we're going to do.

988
00:57:16,373 --> 00:57:21,617
Right? That's a very classic character arc, is the whole time I was going after A,

989
00:57:21,637 --> 00:57:26,421
but it turns out what I really needed was B. So as long as you can keep unity of purpose in that jump,

990
00:57:26,921 --> 00:57:30,665
then that's a perfectly reasonable thing to do with a character. Or the other thing to do,

991
00:57:30,705 --> 00:57:34,688
of course, right, is to leave it up to the player whether or not we're going to change

992
00:57:35,389 --> 00:57:37,450
our purpose. Right? What are we going to do about that?

993
00:57:37,847 --> 00:57:40,730
my friend betrayed me I could shoot them in the face or not

994
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:44,254
what do you do so that's the other way to handle that kind of thing

995
00:57:44,594 --> 00:57:47,638
thank you thank you very much everybody

996
00:57:47,658 --> 00:57:50,421
enjoy the rest of the show
