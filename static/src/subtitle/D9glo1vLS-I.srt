1
00:00:07,957 --> 00:00:13,958
My name is Becca Saltzman, um, and yeah, it's better to be friends, marketing ass, than the reality of game production.

2
00:00:14,818 --> 00:00:22,240
Uh, I am the CEO and co-founder of Finji, which is, uh, both a publishing partner or a publisher and also an independent development team.

3
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,260
So we kind of run both.

4
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,981
We're kind of, we're very weird in the industry and we've been doing it for a while.

5
00:00:26,781 --> 00:00:29,642
Um, my partner is Adam Saltzman, who is our creative director.

6
00:00:29,822 --> 00:00:31,042
Um, he runs our development team.

7
00:00:31,642 --> 00:00:36,463
Um, and if you recognize his name, um, online, his name is Adam Atomics.

8
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:36,603
We,

9
00:00:36,983 --> 00:00:37,865
was Overland.

10
00:00:37,885 --> 00:00:41,411
And we're based in Grand Rapids, Michigan, so we're also in a weird part of the world.

11
00:00:42,192 --> 00:00:44,716
Um, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so,

12
00:00:47,426 --> 00:00:51,310
We make a bunch of games, um, I mentioned two already, Overland and Canabalt.

13
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:58,697
Um, we also publish games like Tunic, I was a teenage exo-colonist, Chicory, A Colorful Tale, and Night in the Woods, among a lot of others.

14
00:00:59,578 --> 00:01:04,963
Um, our studio is roughly, I'm giving you some context so you understand how small we are, um, which is important at something like GDC.

15
00:01:05,584 --> 00:01:07,666
Our studio is roughly divided in half.

16
00:01:10,044 --> 00:01:23,851
um there are approximately 4 biz dev and marketing um community management and launch operations staff and then kind of everyone else is on either QA or development um and that's about like 12 people.

17
00:01:24,711 --> 00:01:31,334
Um we also have a few like floaters as far as like contract workers who pop in and out on various mostly engineering tasks.

18
00:01:32,275 --> 00:01:32,355
Um

19
00:01:33,294 --> 00:01:38,717
We also work with a marketing studio out of the UK called ICO or ICO.

20
00:01:39,878 --> 00:01:41,959
And they help roll out our PR and marketing plans.

21
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:42,820
And we've done this since 2021.

22
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,562
Our launches have kind of gotten too big for just the four of us.

23
00:01:47,923 --> 00:01:49,824
I specifically run the biz side of Finji.

24
00:01:50,645 --> 00:01:55,608
I'm also a core creative team member on both community and marketing initiatives that we produce.

25
00:01:56,088 --> 00:01:58,469
And I'm also a member of the creative team on our internal development.

26
00:02:00,513 --> 00:02:01,873
our game that we're making internally.

27
00:02:02,674 --> 00:02:08,915
It's a really big job and I sometimes wonder what I got myself into when I go to work every morning.

28
00:02:10,476 --> 00:02:17,097
I am also, and this is very important, I'm always the first to know when my studio and my games are being considered for high profile marketing events.

29
00:02:17,797 --> 00:02:25,199
Those emails come to me directly and it's my job to ensure that our teams are prepared to support both external marketing initiatives and internal marketing plans.

30
00:02:25,999 --> 00:02:28,460
And we have been involved in a lot of them.

31
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,112
So that's who I am, just some context.

32
00:02:33,036 --> 00:02:33,577
And I have a question.

33
00:02:33,637 --> 00:02:34,299
Oh, it is doing this.

34
00:02:34,339 --> 00:02:40,611
Okay, so fun bug in PowerPoint, and I'm just gonna point this out so you understand why I'm going back and forth, is that it's supposed to say marketing.

35
00:02:41,926 --> 00:02:42,546
and now it does.

36
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,887
So, if I go back and forth, I apologize.

37
00:02:45,007 --> 00:02:46,847
I don't know what's going on with PowerPoint right now.

38
00:02:47,707 --> 00:02:49,448
Um, so, the schedule problem.

39
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:51,608
We are just mining our own business.

40
00:02:51,628 --> 00:02:55,109
We're like running our development, um, milestones.

41
00:02:55,369 --> 00:03:00,050
We're like getting our dev teams all together and then marketing comes in and is like, marketing initiative!

42
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:03,671
You need to make a trailer in six weeks and you're like, yeah, F you!

43
00:03:04,131 --> 00:03:04,791
Are you insane?

44
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:05,851
We can't do that.

45
00:03:07,192 --> 00:03:08,212
And that's our schedule problem.

46
00:03:09,403 --> 00:03:16,449
A team comes in, drops a massive project change onto your team without notice and you're left scrambling to figure out how to deliver the project and also make a game.

47
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:28,760
Because the, to deliver the project, the outcome requires that you pull development resources off the current milestones and this will often halt the bottle, or basically halt everything, bottleneck development in a pretty serious way.

48
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,361
And we've all done this.

49
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:33,223
Um, so are there any marketing folks here in the room?

50
00:03:34,264 --> 00:03:35,145
Yeah!

51
00:03:35,225 --> 00:03:35,485
Hi!

52
00:03:36,747 --> 00:03:50,097
you're, you're team marketing uh everyone else is production and I know for a fact that right now you're like thinking in your head we hate each other so much because marketing comes in it's like I need this thing because we do.

53
00:03:50,277 --> 00:03:55,742
It came in our email and production's like how dare you come and ask me for this asset.

54
00:03:56,282 --> 00:04:01,566
We don't have time for this or the budget and both realities are valid.

55
00:04:01,966 --> 00:04:04,488
It's just how it is and this talk is like well how,

56
00:04:05,609 --> 00:04:22,079
can we never have that conversation where we hate each other and we're cursing at each other and we act like preschoolers in our own offices and roll our eyes and continue to have poor collaborative communication practices.

57
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:27,022
So I want you to know it doesn't have to be this way, at least not the way you experience it now.

58
00:04:27,402 --> 00:04:30,744
You shouldn't have to delay marketing assets until a request comes in.

59
00:04:31,765 --> 00:04:34,046
You can plan for these in your development schedule.

60
00:04:36,463 --> 00:04:39,286
and it's going to do it again because PowerPoint hates me.

61
00:04:39,526 --> 00:04:49,616
So external opportunities, this is the thing that we call all of these emails that come in, which is our polite way of saying thank you, Sony, for this external opportunity.

62
00:04:49,697 --> 00:04:51,078
Thank you, Nintendo, I appreciate

63
00:04:51,428 --> 00:04:52,489
that external opportunity.

64
00:04:53,949 --> 00:04:57,851
Because as a marketing person, we also hate these e-mails and love them.

65
00:04:58,552 --> 00:05:02,133
Because we know what it's going to do to everybody on the team to support it.

66
00:05:02,233 --> 00:05:03,914
They're really big projects.

67
00:05:04,194 --> 00:05:06,496
They're also really good for studios and for your team.

68
00:05:07,336 --> 00:05:10,998
Anyone who can amplify your message, like, you should do that.

69
00:05:12,258 --> 00:05:13,179
It's very noisy out there.

70
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,803
So these are self-directed or externally directed times, these external marketing opportunities.

71
00:05:20,423 --> 00:05:25,465
When you are going to publicly participate in some kind of marketing event, we're at one right now.

72
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:29,147
There are a lot of teams right now that are also flying to PAX East.

73
00:05:29,587 --> 00:05:30,608
My team is there right now.

74
00:05:32,049 --> 00:05:37,691
There are teams who have been working for months and months to participate at these events with trailers, demos, and other assets.

75
00:05:37,891 --> 00:05:41,973
And the events are great, but they're also a nightmare to support for any size of team.

76
00:05:44,656 --> 00:05:54,820
So, because these events usually start outside, um, of the studio, they have the potential to seriously disrupt the development and schedule of the game.

77
00:05:55,661 --> 00:05:59,322
Um, and I don't know about you, but I could do without the additional stress.

78
00:05:59,963 --> 00:06:04,485
Um, the sprints, crunch, frustration, and burnout, um, and there should be another way forward.

79
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:07,006
So, I'm going to give you some context as kind of,

80
00:06:08,632 --> 00:06:14,778
I'm trying to think of, the kind of external opportunities that we, just in the last five years, that I have supported with my studio.

81
00:06:15,358 --> 00:06:16,599
And we'll see if this works.

82
00:06:17,901 --> 00:06:23,746
So, a quick disclaimer, um, we've supported both PlayStation State of Play and PlayStation Indies.

83
00:06:24,487 --> 00:06:32,294
Um, I've done a Nintendo Direct and a Nintendo Indie World, um, the Xbox E3 press conference, plus their Twitch events.

84
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,628
uh, the game awards, that's a fun one, and very weird.

85
00:06:37,369 --> 00:06:52,301
Uh, Apple keynotes and product launches, um, also additional partner events, conventions, uh, old PSX, PlayStation experience for example, demo events, plus the online develop, uh, demo events, et cetera, uh, and more, and more, and more.

86
00:06:52,381 --> 00:06:54,543
It's like endless, these are endless events.

87
00:06:55,184 --> 00:06:58,967
Um, and as I mentioned, we are a very, very small studio.

88
00:06:59,727 --> 00:07:04,272
and we are in these all the time, and it should destroy us.

89
00:07:05,473 --> 00:07:07,395
So, the collaborative marketing process.

90
00:07:08,276 --> 00:07:18,747
I'm gonna talk about the process that Finji uses to plan, prep, and produce marketing assets alongside our internal development schedules across our separate teams, of which there are many, because we do publish as well.

91
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:20,670
it went up.

92
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,971
Uh so first planning.

93
00:07:22,991 --> 00:07:29,293
Uh we plan as early as possible and this seems really obvious um and I'll get to this in a second.

94
00:07:29,713 --> 00:07:40,316
This is the type of marketing strategy that focuses on when a marketing team is considering how to use events around the industry as external megaphones and how those types of partnerships require deadlines that are externally enforced.

95
00:07:40,776 --> 00:07:43,017
And we literally spend the bulk of our time in this phase.

96
00:07:45,157 --> 00:07:47,778
Because as long as we plan

97
00:07:49,141 --> 00:07:53,027
We are able to prepare all of our things in advance, and I'm going to explain how this is possible.

98
00:07:53,548 --> 00:08:02,342
These are the things that we do to anticipate future marketing asks, and we are given possible outcomes in collaboration with our marketing teams.

99
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:10,502
to identify the marketing needs sort of externally with our business partners.

100
00:08:11,562 --> 00:08:22,845
And then when we get to produce, we usually only spend about 10% of our time on this because we've done so much planning and prep work that everything is there, everything is ready for us to put together the asset and get it out as soon as possible.

101
00:08:24,346 --> 00:08:28,187
In most cases, we're only at a polish phase when we finally get to this.

102
00:08:34,395 --> 00:08:36,176
So, I mentioned this already.

103
00:08:37,577 --> 00:08:38,478
Oh no, it's gonna do it again.

104
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,742
The thing we're gonna talk about the most today is how to plan for these things as early as possible.

105
00:08:46,243 --> 00:08:53,147
And a lot of this is going to be about communications, the questions that you can ask, and the things that you can prepare and build into your development schedules.

106
00:08:54,808 --> 00:08:58,630
Okay, so questions for production teams, and there's a lot of marketers here.

107
00:08:59,911 --> 00:09:00,792
They're also for you as well.

108
00:09:03,618 --> 00:09:06,399
So, we are going to talk about a lot of stuff.

109
00:09:07,419 --> 00:09:13,861
Um, since we're all sitting here right now, I don't have a very good idea of what kind of studios you come from.

110
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:16,142
I don't know if you're a studio of one or a studio of a thousand.

111
00:09:16,862 --> 00:09:22,984
So, these are going to be kind of high level things that you can take back and use to create a process within your studio.

112
00:09:24,184 --> 00:09:29,566
Um, I'm going to do my best to define things that you may not know and point out things that you might want to research later.

113
00:09:30,026 --> 00:09:30,086
Um,

114
00:09:31,235 --> 00:09:41,924
I know that I'm speaking to both marketing and production professionals, um, and I know that some of this might be unknown territory between those two, um, like aspects of game development.

115
00:09:42,644 --> 00:09:44,206
So, things are gonna be working together today.

116
00:09:44,386 --> 00:09:46,968
Why is there a disconnect between the discipline schedules and priority?

117
00:09:47,689 --> 00:09:49,970
How does this limit good collaborative communication?

118
00:09:50,271 --> 00:09:53,113
How can external marketing asks affect development teams?

119
00:09:53,834 --> 00:09:57,877
Uh, your anticip- anticipatory pipelines, um, what, how can you build those?

120
00:10:01,414 --> 00:10:01,934
I love that.

121
00:10:02,475 --> 00:10:04,156
I would like to talk to somebody about this bug.

122
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,578
How can you control for these timelines?

123
00:10:06,859 --> 00:10:12,143
What kind of milestones and test, tasks can you build into your production schedules to address the needs of all of your team?

124
00:10:13,564 --> 00:10:18,108
And what kind of, uh, anticip, anticipatory pipelines can you build?

125
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:23,313
Um, so, we're gonna plan as early as possible.

126
00:10:23,593 --> 00:10:26,956
Do you know what information you need?

127
00:10:27,534 --> 00:10:28,794
And the answer is, maybe.

128
00:10:29,735 --> 00:10:40,058
So when I was asked to give this talk, I was in a group of production professionals, and someone I look up to said, it would be incredible if there was a talk at GDC that talked about how we can plan for the things for our marketing teams to ask.

129
00:10:40,438 --> 00:10:43,979
Supporting those just kills our development schedules, and it's awful.

130
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:45,980
And I was like, damn, that's like my whole job.

131
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:46,700
It's my wheelhouse.

132
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,480
I can talk about this.

133
00:10:49,521 --> 00:10:52,902
And when this came up, I was a few days from participating in our first Nintendo Directs.

134
00:10:52,922 --> 00:10:56,723
This was last fall, which took months

135
00:10:57,205 --> 00:11:05,827
of preparation for our team, completely over the timeline of when we were launching I Was a Teenage Exo-Colonist on PC, Storefriends, also PS4, 5, and Switch.

136
00:11:06,847 --> 00:11:13,128
We were also optimizing and developing Tunet for PlayStation 4, 5, and Nintendo Switch, and also running patches on the original Xbox builds of the game.

137
00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:15,269
We were really, really busy.

138
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:24,891
And Nintendo coming in and being like, how about a direct, which is like a really big event in our industry, was very scary.

139
00:11:26,564 --> 00:11:30,706
but we planned for this across our small teams for years before we got to September 2022.

140
00:11:31,026 --> 00:11:37,449
This was a possibility and an outcome that might have come up and we did a lot of work in advance for it.

141
00:11:38,209 --> 00:11:42,491
So do you know what information you need to support a marketing initiative?

142
00:11:42,992 --> 00:11:43,492
Possibly.

143
00:11:43,792 --> 00:11:45,313
Do you know what questions you need to ask?

144
00:11:45,553 --> 00:11:47,073
Do you know how to get that information?

145
00:11:47,834 --> 00:11:50,195
And this is what we're going to be chatting about first.

146
00:11:52,967 --> 00:11:53,788
So dev production.

147
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:56,470
There is a misunderstanding about timelines.

148
00:11:56,710 --> 00:12:01,154
When we talked about marketing timelines and dev timelines, we are like in different universes.

149
00:12:01,994 --> 00:12:06,198
Dev timelines, we're talking about weeks, months, years.

150
00:12:07,298 --> 00:12:07,999
I love them.

151
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:09,881
They're so comfortable for me.

152
00:12:11,562 --> 00:12:13,243
When we talk about marketing timelines,

153
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:17,751
The email I got this morning may not even exist tomorrow.

154
00:12:18,652 --> 00:12:21,554
Whatever they asked for is no longer even a project.

155
00:12:21,934 --> 00:12:24,296
It was on fire and now it's gone.

156
00:12:26,118 --> 00:12:30,922
Our task and projects list just for this week will change completely often.

157
00:12:31,022 --> 00:12:32,844
We don't have the luxury

158
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:37,129
of weeks and months and years, even though we really would like that to exist.

159
00:12:37,429 --> 00:12:44,373
And when you're talking to each other as production, dev production and marketing, this is where the disconnect often happens.

160
00:12:45,093 --> 00:12:47,694
Because we're like, well, why can't you just give this to me?

161
00:12:48,075 --> 00:12:48,555
Marketing.

162
00:12:49,015 --> 00:12:51,236
And dev is like, are you insane?

163
00:12:51,797 --> 00:12:52,577
That doesn't exist.

164
00:12:52,597 --> 00:12:56,279
It's not going to exist until next year because we're on different schedules.

165
00:13:00,444 --> 00:13:03,245
So, we need to control for the unknown.

166
00:13:04,005 --> 00:13:09,707
We need to integrate our marketing team into the development process, which is a lot of education and I'm not going to sugar coat that.

167
00:13:10,087 --> 00:13:12,448
It is a lot of like, no, that's a misunderstanding.

168
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,569
Like, no, that's not how that actually works.

169
00:13:15,149 --> 00:13:21,051
I love you very much, let's go out to lunch and talk about how the holistic process of the studio actually flows together.

170
00:13:22,512 --> 00:13:29,154
But since your marketing team's goals may change at a moment's notice, it's easy to think, well, let's ignore them until they really need something.

171
00:13:30,523 --> 00:13:38,691
which, I mean, been there, been ignored before, but the opposite is actually a healthier approach, because your marketing team is going to need the same assets no matter what.

172
00:13:40,072 --> 00:13:47,539
I was talking to somebody earlier, I was like, can you imagine going up to a dev team and being like, I'm going to need a trailer, and the dev team is like, what?

173
00:13:47,739 --> 00:13:48,420
A trailer?

174
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,362
I'm going to have to launch this game someday?

175
00:13:50,442 --> 00:13:51,323
And the answer is yes.

176
00:13:52,881 --> 00:13:57,607
you're gonna have to launch, these are things you're going to have to make, no matter what, it has to exist.

177
00:13:57,967 --> 00:14:05,156
So the idea that this could possibly ever just drop into your scope is baffling.

178
00:14:06,377 --> 00:14:08,480
So marketing, gotta remind them a little bit earlier.

179
00:14:10,712 --> 00:14:18,377
So not just the trailer, but like you're gonna have to have key art, you're gonna have to have B-roll, you're gonna probably need a behind closed doors demo.

180
00:14:18,397 --> 00:14:25,121
These are all things that are so normal to game marketing and we just throw them on the dev team kind of last minute.

181
00:14:26,302 --> 00:14:29,704
So instead of ignoring them, we should be bringing the dev team in.

182
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:38,489
We should be educating them on the future assets that they're going to need and we're going to integrate them into your team so you can never be ambushed again, but on both sides.

183
00:14:39,502 --> 00:14:40,443
So how do you integrate this?

184
00:14:42,984 --> 00:14:47,687
How do you sort of take a marketing lead into a development process?

185
00:14:48,768 --> 00:14:50,509
And what is the purpose and goal of this relationship?

186
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:57,773
So we have knowledge on the game design that's happening outside the game, and I'll explain that in one second.

187
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,994
We have knowledge on the game design that's happening inside the game.

188
00:15:00,535 --> 00:15:05,918
Producers know what's happening inside the game, and marketing leads know what's happening outside the game.

189
00:15:08,246 --> 00:15:10,027
and you can have a meeting about these two things.

190
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:20,071
I want to, not necessarily back up exactly, but I am going to tell you a little bit about marketing design in just one second.

191
00:15:21,272 --> 00:15:25,633
You're going to want to structure the meetings that you have between these two types of design.

192
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:31,581
to get at the goals of your team and what ideas that you have and what timelines that they're planning for.

193
00:15:32,382 --> 00:15:35,103
How do you want to talk about your project to the outside world?

194
00:15:35,243 --> 00:15:38,165
And these are all going to feed back into what you should be working on internally.

195
00:15:39,385 --> 00:15:42,747
So sitting down with your marketing team means that you can do the following.

196
00:15:43,428 --> 00:15:46,489
Marketing can play the game and ask questions.

197
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:55,114
They can review design documents like story bibles, not to make the game more marketable, but to ask them what ideas they have about future marketing angles.

198
00:15:56,175 --> 00:15:59,896
production can ask what types of marketing materials the marketing team would like to access.

199
00:16:00,616 --> 00:16:02,897
And when they think, they might need those assets.

200
00:16:03,937 --> 00:16:21,342
And then they can continue to circle with regular meetings closer and closer and closer, um, to launch, um, because development is going to continue and continue to hone in on like the exact marketing, the exact marketing message, um, outside of this.

201
00:16:22,402 --> 00:16:22,462
Um,

202
00:16:22,904 --> 00:16:24,887
outside of like internal from the studio.

203
00:16:24,947 --> 00:16:26,569
The communication needs to happen outside.

204
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:29,413
So, the more you know.

205
00:16:31,034 --> 00:16:33,655
uh we need to document the possibilities.

206
00:16:34,095 --> 00:16:37,896
And this relationship requires a give and take from the design team and the marketing team.

207
00:16:38,476 --> 00:16:46,558
So you're going to need to sort of dig down and talk about like how would these possible initiatives, these marketing initiatives, overlap future external deliverable schedules.

208
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,579
So, what does that mean?

209
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:50,540
These are words that I'm spouting at you.

210
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:56,161
Imagine that you're like I'm going to be in a state of play in, when do state of plays happen?

211
00:16:57,482 --> 00:16:58,082
Out February?

212
00:16:58,382 --> 00:16:58,722
October?

213
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:00,025
those two dates.

214
00:17:00,065 --> 00:17:01,986
February, October, sometimes the middle of the year one.

215
00:17:02,626 --> 00:17:05,828
I'm going to be in a state of play in October of this year.

216
00:17:06,408 --> 00:17:07,668
Or I want to work towards that.

217
00:17:07,908 --> 00:17:09,269
That's going to require a trailer.

218
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:11,610
It's going to require a blog post.

219
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:21,174
If a marketing team knows that they would like to make some kind of announcement like that, they would have that information probably at least, at least a year in advance.

220
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:22,974
That that's what they're going to be working towards.

221
00:17:23,435 --> 00:17:29,297
And if you as a production team don't ask that question, when would you like to announce a thing, you cannot

222
00:17:29,878 --> 00:17:31,458
develop something to support it.

223
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:36,320
So how do these possible initiatives fit into partner expectations?

224
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:40,721
So we partner with a lot of people, Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo, Apple.

225
00:17:41,701 --> 00:17:43,662
What expectations do they have about this?

226
00:17:44,122 --> 00:17:51,244
Has the marketing team, who talks to these partners, expressed the goals to you, the dev team?

227
00:17:51,344 --> 00:17:52,984
Because otherwise you're going to be making two different things.

228
00:17:54,545 --> 00:17:58,146
And then how do these things that they're asking for impact development at a glance?

229
00:17:59,403 --> 00:18:05,824
Can you see where you're going to fall short on the expectations that people outside of your development structure have?

230
00:18:08,405 --> 00:18:12,666
So to answer these questions, you should be looking at your development schedule.

231
00:18:12,806 --> 00:18:16,566
You need to ask, are you building the right parts of the game to support future marketing assets?

232
00:18:17,087 --> 00:18:18,787
You should be able to answer that.

233
00:18:19,547 --> 00:18:29,209
If marketing comes back and like, I'm pretty certain I'm going to need to put a boss fight in a trailer next year, and boss fights take a little while, you should probably be like, I need to push some stuff around.

234
00:18:30,029 --> 00:18:31,690
like we're going to have to build a boss fight.

235
00:18:32,851 --> 00:18:45,240
Um, if your publisher or partner wants to see, um, like a different angle working towards a marketing asset or they have an angle that they want to work towards, if you don't know what that is, you can't build for it.

236
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:56,928
Um, so yeah, there's, you need to be able to take your marketing team, um, that like there are two true things.

237
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:02,302
Like, here's an update and give good parameters and boundaries on what is settled content and what is not.

238
00:19:02,722 --> 00:19:07,704
And then talk about external schedules and partner expectations that might change and morph on long development schedules.

239
00:19:07,744 --> 00:19:11,626
And then you need to follow up again and again and again in all of your meetings.

240
00:19:12,966 --> 00:19:22,911
So the more the dev team knows, in order to get your development team to

241
00:19:25,023 --> 00:19:31,511
understand the things that you're going to be working for, you're going to need to communicate future marketing opportunities to the creative leadership.

242
00:19:31,531 --> 00:19:32,632
So,

243
00:19:37,132 --> 00:19:39,953
marketing teams, we're just going to sort of bounce outside of this for a second.

244
00:19:39,973 --> 00:19:42,994
Marketing teams have, internally we call them a marketing beat schedule.

245
00:19:43,454 --> 00:19:59,962
Other teams might call it something else where they might look at the two years in front of you and be like, I, based on the development schedule that's been expressed to me, we're going to probably want to announce a title here, we're going to need to do these certain things in between our next big beat, which might be a demo or another content drive.

246
00:20:02,078 --> 00:20:05,040
and that's going to be sort of mapped out over the course of like a couple of years.

247
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:09,064
It's going to have like social media, it's going to have advertising, it's going to be a lot of stuff in a marketing beat schedule.

248
00:20:10,465 --> 00:20:17,291
Anytime you have one of those things, a marketing team should be able to take that to your creative leadership and to the production schedule and sort of talk about the range and scope

249
00:20:18,143 --> 00:20:20,944
of what's going on inside of that particular document.

250
00:20:21,244 --> 00:20:24,124
Because marketing is able to see opportunities here and here and here.

251
00:20:24,864 --> 00:20:33,326
And we need to be able to put together the most important and interesting parts of the game in order to support those particular marketing initiatives.

252
00:20:35,226 --> 00:20:44,808
As part of that, as a production team, you're going to sort of, with the marketing team, identify the sort of parameters around this.

253
00:20:46,363 --> 00:20:51,526
basing this on an evaluation of what is possible versus what is desirable.

254
00:20:51,606 --> 00:21:02,612
So you're filling in the boundaries of the full scope of the development schedule sitting out in front of you.

255
00:21:03,633 --> 00:21:06,495
And you're probably going to say, but Becca, my creative team is really difficult.

256
00:21:06,555 --> 00:21:07,976
My marketing team is really difficult.

257
00:21:08,396 --> 00:21:14,679
But as a producer, it's your job to be able to go into a meeting between a creative team and a marketing team.

258
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:26,714
identify the problems that marketing is saying that they need to solve, and the creative team the assets and the development that can solve them.

259
00:21:27,155 --> 00:21:30,096
Like, it's your job to sort of put those two pieces together.

260
00:21:36,219 --> 00:21:41,582
In order to communicate future marketing opportunities to the creative leadership

261
00:21:43,806 --> 00:21:57,327
If the people who make the creative decisions don't know what the future expectations likely might be, you're not actually going to be able to make well-intentioned decisions to be able to support them.

262
00:21:58,502 --> 00:22:03,905
which involves identifying the overlap between marketing and what you're building.

263
00:22:03,925 --> 00:22:14,391
Because what you're building is so huge and what marketing is building is so huge and there's only a very small overlap in the middle of identifying the marketing needs from development.

264
00:22:17,212 --> 00:22:22,215
And it's like, what part of the game that you're making fulfills this in the coolest way?

265
00:22:25,922 --> 00:22:30,203
So, there's some examples of things that you can do kind of during this particular time.

266
00:22:31,884 --> 00:22:44,907
If you've had the conversations, if you're able to identify the problems that the marketing team is intending to solve, there are lots of parts that you can plan for in advance.

267
00:22:45,107 --> 00:22:45,987
So, for example,

268
00:22:46,837 --> 00:22:50,460
you're gonna have to build a trailer, an announced trailer, title announced trailer.

269
00:22:51,561 --> 00:22:54,163
Are you able to storyboard this in advance?

270
00:22:54,523 --> 00:23:01,949
Are you able to sit down with your marketing team, identify the talking points that marketing team is going to have to prepare materials around.

271
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:13,699
It's going to be an action RPG with X amount of combat and this sort of main character fulfilling these genre requirements.

272
00:23:15,043 --> 00:23:33,852
with the assets that you have and the development, like sort of vertical slice, the game that you have available, can you storyboard out what is possible in that exact moment and how does that adapt throughout the next possibly up to a year before you actually have to make that trailer?

273
00:23:33,872 --> 00:23:39,175
You're already sitting on the plans before you have to go into actually developing that asset.

274
00:23:40,399 --> 00:23:46,822
A thing that we do often is we build our vertical slices to also accommodate different types of demos.

275
00:23:47,582 --> 00:24:03,368
Um, so when we go into pre-production and then early production, we're already sitting on at least 45 up to like 90 minutes of a game that we developed intentionally to support early marketing asks like a 15 minute show demo that we can cut very quickly out of it.

276
00:24:03,888 --> 00:24:07,690
Um, it's all, all been highly polished or um,

277
00:24:09,074 --> 00:24:14,757
uh gone through like all the VFX treatments um and we can also cut that into a longer sort of online steam demo.

278
00:24:14,997 --> 00:24:19,038
That's early early assets and sometimes we have that done upwards of a year in advance.

279
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,661
Um we also do this because this can also be cut into a trailer as well.

280
00:24:24,781 --> 00:24:32,204
We're sitting on at least 90 minutes of a game, we cut that into a trailer and then we are not asking for additional assets when that does come in.

281
00:24:33,184 --> 00:24:36,346
So this is all done because this is all

282
00:24:38,735 --> 00:24:43,799
these are all assets that are going to be needed and we can front load them and then sit on those for as long as possible.

283
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:47,802
Because they're going to be marketing needs that would ordinarily destroy our studio.

284
00:24:49,023 --> 00:24:49,884
We didn't used to do this.

285
00:24:50,104 --> 00:24:56,349
The first tunic trailer that came out at the E3 showcase in 20 some time in the past.

286
00:24:58,111 --> 00:25:00,833
I don't know if years have passed since then, but it was

287
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:10,268
2018.

288
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:10,268
We didn't have any of this sitting around, and we had to do whole, like, boss designs for it, which is why the librarian looks very different than it does now in the final game.

289
00:25:11,049 --> 00:25:13,913
That was designed in about four weeks before the trailers put together.

290
00:25:15,034 --> 00:25:19,599
And it was a huge problem when we were going to launch the game, like, would somebody actually notice?

291
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,261
The answer is no.

292
00:25:23,433 --> 00:25:24,914
So we prepare in advance.

293
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:32,238
This is sort of what came out of that particular experience, which was we had to stop Tunic development entirely in 2018 in order to build a trailer.

294
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:35,199
We have stopped doing that.

295
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:41,743
We prepare almost everything that we do in advance, and we schedule this into production itself.

296
00:25:42,163 --> 00:25:44,464
If we know we have a trailer, everyone has a trailer.

297
00:25:44,524 --> 00:25:46,205
Everyone in this room, you're making games, you have a trailer.

298
00:25:47,472 --> 00:25:52,694
The thing that you should be thinking of right now is what the hell in the build that you're making can be used in a trailer.

299
00:25:52,834 --> 00:25:54,054
What story are you trying to tell?

300
00:25:54,154 --> 00:25:55,915
And your marketing team does know that information.

301
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:59,115
So another Finji example.

302
00:25:59,856 --> 00:26:07,738
Tunic needed a new demo as we were sprinting towards launch to address an issue that we had with future players thinking that the game was more Zelda than Dark Souls.

303
00:26:08,698 --> 00:26:14,140
Which if you saw early Tunic stuff, it was like a fox running around a dappled forest with a sword and wearing a tunic.

304
00:26:15,345 --> 00:26:44,623
the name has nothing to do with that but uh wearing a little green shirt and like looks like a Zelda clone and we were very aware of it um but the game also has tricky combat and a lot of secrets it really isn't a puzzle game um but we knew this back in 2019 and 2020 that this was going to be a massive problem with launch um and we communicated this um specifically because we identified it in marketing we identified it across a lot of axes that this was

305
00:26:45,456 --> 00:26:50,119
absolutely going to challenge the expectations that our players had when we did launch the game.

306
00:26:50,939 --> 00:27:00,005
And on the development side, when we talked about this, they started to sketch out how a new marketing asset could be made to identify what was wrong with this.

307
00:27:00,405 --> 00:27:14,354
And then we overlapped this specifically with the development schedule to make sure that it was going to be done in advance, that we had a demo that identified the fact that Tunic needed sort of a rework on making people understand that the game had pretty tricky combat.

308
00:27:16,277 --> 00:27:19,541
The pieces of this were complete in September of 2020.

309
00:27:20,702 --> 00:27:23,506
We did not launch this until June of 2021.

310
00:27:23,606 --> 00:27:27,170
We built it into the production schedule.

311
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:29,753
We aligned it alongside TUNIT getting finished up.

312
00:27:29,933 --> 00:27:33,978
We cut it and we sat on it for seven months waiting for the appropriate marketing

313
00:27:34,298 --> 00:27:36,660
timeline to be basically given to us.

314
00:27:36,941 --> 00:27:45,889
Xbox was running a demo event, we pulled the demo, sent it off to our porting studio, two weeks later we had a demo that had gone through certification.

315
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:52,895
That was all planned in advance and sort of sitting in the wings for as soon as somebody had it ready to go.

316
00:27:54,116 --> 00:27:59,842
And yeah, we planned it, we prepared for it well in advance,

317
00:28:01,331 --> 00:28:09,056
pulled the asset together and we already had the full marketing buy in from everybody, every stakeholder before it happened.

318
00:28:09,216 --> 00:28:11,157
Because it did happen over the course of a year.

319
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:18,101
So where are you going to schedule this in production?

320
00:28:19,442 --> 00:28:21,503
These are all obvious assets.

321
00:28:21,644 --> 00:28:23,965
And that was, this was one of the hardest things when I was making this talk.

322
00:28:23,985 --> 00:28:28,408
It's like this seems, these are obvious things that have obvious game

323
00:28:29,688 --> 00:28:31,689
assets, like they have things that come out of the build.

324
00:28:31,729 --> 00:28:34,011
You can't make a gameplay trailer without a game.

325
00:28:35,452 --> 00:28:41,815
So why is it that when we come in and say we need a trailer, it's like a new idea that has happened before?

326
00:28:42,036 --> 00:28:43,737
And it's because we don't have these conversations.

327
00:28:43,777 --> 00:28:46,438
We're not coming in and saying in a year we're probably going to need a gameplay trailer.

328
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:51,021
Or we're saying nobody's listening and I can't do anything about that.

329
00:28:54,622 --> 00:29:01,932
So what, I say that these are obvious assets, and then I realize that they're not, because what do marketing teams need?

330
00:29:01,972 --> 00:29:02,633
What are some of the things?

331
00:29:02,653 --> 00:29:10,565
There's probably gonna be a lot more, because there might be like, well I need all these like advertising assets, and I didn't include those, because most of them overlap with a bunch of this other stuff.

332
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:13,618
So we sometimes need show floor demos.

333
00:29:13,718 --> 00:29:17,681
If you still travel to things like PAX or can handle doing those.

334
00:29:19,162 --> 00:29:19,943
Or, I mean, they're here.

335
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:23,766
Like if you just walk out here on second and third floor, there's a bunch of show floor demos.

336
00:29:23,786 --> 00:29:24,806
They're down at the day of the dive.

337
00:29:24,826 --> 00:29:25,807
So it's a show floor demo.

338
00:29:26,227 --> 00:29:28,269
Usually like a 15 minute demo that self restarts.

339
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:30,351
It's been locked off in some ways.

340
00:29:30,431 --> 00:29:32,532
So if somebody wants to come up and steal it, they can't.

341
00:29:34,246 --> 00:29:37,012
like that's a thing that has to come from the game itself.

342
00:29:37,653 --> 00:29:42,103
We also need trailers, they come in a variety of lengths, 45, 60, 90 seconds or longer.

343
00:29:45,412 --> 00:29:49,034
There's also screen shots, usually without UI, depending on who you're working with.

344
00:29:49,614 --> 00:30:02,161
There's B-roll, we have online demos which have different constraints than a show floor demo, usually a little bit longer, because it's going to be on like a steam online event, or it can be replayed.

345
00:30:02,341 --> 00:30:04,142
You also have the GIFs, social media assets,

346
00:30:05,865 --> 00:30:06,966
We also have interviews.

347
00:30:07,286 --> 00:30:09,688
I'm including this because this is a deliverable.

348
00:30:09,828 --> 00:30:11,069
You have to do PR training.

349
00:30:11,089 --> 00:30:12,570
You have to be up on talking points.

350
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:15,612
What does marketing, what did they identify has been a problem?

351
00:30:15,712 --> 00:30:16,873
And you can talk to that.

352
00:30:17,473 --> 00:30:17,674
Oops.

353
00:30:18,995 --> 00:30:21,036
And then there's also store texts and blog posts.

354
00:30:22,477 --> 00:30:25,539
All of these are the sort of things that you can prepare for.

355
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,681
You can do all of these things in advance.

356
00:30:28,206 --> 00:30:31,250
We do our PR and marketing training like months in advance.

357
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:33,232
Sometimes we even do like practice interviews.

358
00:30:34,033 --> 00:30:38,478
Um, because it's good to do if you're going to put devs out in front of people.

359
00:30:38,498 --> 00:30:40,240
You should probably train them how to talk to people.

360
00:30:40,921 --> 00:30:42,163
Because interviews are weird.

361
00:30:46,616 --> 00:30:49,497
So what are you making now to support marketing?

362
00:30:49,797 --> 00:30:50,738
So we have our marketing plan.

363
00:30:50,778 --> 00:30:51,458
We have your game.

364
00:30:51,878 --> 00:30:57,400
What part of your in-development game can double as your future marketing needs from development?

365
00:30:58,741 --> 00:31:01,482
Internally, we're like, what can you make now that is cool enough for later?

366
00:31:02,302 --> 00:31:04,263
And we do front load lots of cool stuff.

367
00:31:09,525 --> 00:31:14,306
So I brought up this example earlier just because we literally rely on this all the time.

368
00:31:16,311 --> 00:31:28,015
Vertical slice is a weird like sort of terminology here in the industry um because it can be everything, sometimes it's just like uh it's like your pretty corner, some people call it that.

369
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:34,737
Um it can be like 15 minutes, it can also be like a huge portion of your game, it can be like upwards of 3 hours.

370
00:31:35,397 --> 00:31:37,117
However you define that, it's kind of up to you.

371
00:31:37,418 --> 00:31:41,879
But in general, whenever we start a project and we get, I mean

372
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:45,502
currently, it's usually about two-ish years into something.

373
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:51,443
We usually have a very, very pretty, very, very set, very polished and ready to go vertical slice.

374
00:31:52,003 --> 00:31:55,724
We always, always cut that up into two different things.

375
00:31:55,764 --> 00:31:58,984
We have our show floor demo and we have our online demo.

376
00:31:59,004 --> 00:32:02,545
And that usually is like about a 45 minute experience.

377
00:32:03,305 --> 00:32:05,626
Meant to be replayed again and has good game loops.

378
00:32:06,769 --> 00:32:10,875
The vertical slice is always also cut into a trailer, so it needs to include the full scope of the game.

379
00:32:11,055 --> 00:32:18,846
So if you have a narrative and an action component and a boss battle, if you have a magical system and you have the things that are important, all of these things are present.

380
00:32:19,186 --> 00:32:23,472
Because they get cut into the trailer, even though it's only going to be like a snippet of it,

381
00:32:24,426 --> 00:32:27,048
it is a thing that you are going to want to include to tell a story.

382
00:32:27,468 --> 00:32:32,492
Because every single one of the frames of your trailer will be screenshotted individually.

383
00:32:32,832 --> 00:32:34,193
So people will be like, whoa, what is that?

384
00:32:34,513 --> 00:32:35,654
It's a marketing tool.

385
00:32:35,714 --> 00:32:41,758
So the more things you add, as far as gameplay, gives more conversations for your future players to talk about.

386
00:32:42,639 --> 00:32:45,320
Those also, that same trailer gets cut up into your screenshots.

387
00:32:45,781 --> 00:32:47,842
You can use the same asset to make your screenshots.

388
00:32:47,922 --> 00:32:51,164
It also gets cut up, or it uses the key art.

389
00:32:53,087 --> 00:32:55,807
as part of the start and finish of it.

390
00:32:56,908 --> 00:32:59,328
All of our trailers get cut up into our social media GIFs.

391
00:32:59,628 --> 00:33:04,609
We use the exact same asset for this, and that includes everything that goes up on social media.

392
00:33:05,869 --> 00:33:12,090
This is one thing that we built early on in development, and it supports all of our initial launch assets.

393
00:33:18,231 --> 00:33:19,472
There we go.

394
00:33:19,492 --> 00:33:20,772
So responsive assets.

395
00:33:25,552 --> 00:33:28,616
responsive assets is sort of like the term that I have for

396
00:33:34,111 --> 00:33:42,178
So when development knows what marketing needs to address, the development can work on parts of the game that respond to that need.

397
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:44,600
That's what I refer to as responsive assets.

398
00:33:46,141 --> 00:33:59,633
You're working together with the team who's tasked with communicating to the public about your game, and you are building a development process, understanding what might be needed in the future to address that asset, or to address that need.

399
00:34:01,403 --> 00:34:06,927
If you aren't making a responsive asset, you're just making an asset that doesn't have a plan behind it.

400
00:34:08,108 --> 00:34:10,370
If you're not talking to your marketing team, it's not responsive.

401
00:34:11,031 --> 00:34:13,553
You're just making stuff.

402
00:34:14,213 --> 00:34:23,921
And you have no concept or understanding of what people are saying or what people are needing, or possibly even the cultural implications of what you're putting out there.

403
00:34:25,642 --> 00:34:27,064
There's also business development needs.

404
00:34:29,981 --> 00:34:41,088
In the Tunic example, if we didn't manage our partner's expectations, we would have like sort of missed the boat on reviews and player expectations and support cues.

405
00:34:41,608 --> 00:34:51,014
Specifically, if we didn't tell people that there was combat alongside Zelda, like we would not have managed those expectations, it would not have responded to the things we knew that were happening out in public.

406
00:34:53,485 --> 00:34:58,027
and your marketing team kind of knows all of this stuff.

407
00:34:58,547 --> 00:35:01,988
If they're asking the right questions, they know that there are problems.

408
00:35:02,008 --> 00:35:03,569
They're out there listening to culture.

409
00:35:03,589 --> 00:35:08,711
Their whole job is to design a place out in the world for your game to exist.

410
00:35:09,712 --> 00:35:17,195
If you're not utilizing them and asking them the things that they're seeing, you're kind of missing the boat on being able to design and implement responsive assets.

411
00:35:18,697 --> 00:35:27,600
and it's kind of on you to work with them to build the best version of this communication structure of understanding what they see and how that feeds back into your development process.

412
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:34,722
Because what we prepare is going to change how it's positioned sort of out in the world.

413
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:39,564
And it's just, it's going to feed back constantly.

414
00:35:44,965 --> 00:36:02,569
So, I have a second example of sort of a weird responsive asset, um, and it's a very, very small piece of a Tunic trailer, um, and I didn't actually put it in here, uh, because you can, you can just check it online because it would take slightly too long to show it, but we needed to put together a launch trailer for Tunic that showed a lot more of the game than we had showed in the past.

415
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:13,392
Um, previously we'd only ever shown the forest and the caves and various assets that we had, but we needed to hint at sort of the larger bosses, the scarier parts, the combat, the secrets, the manual that was,

416
00:36:14,568 --> 00:36:17,529
in some of the assets that were out there, but not in the way that they launched.

417
00:36:19,049 --> 00:36:20,830
The trailer had a lot of things to communicate.

418
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:28,112
And the first trailer, the drafts that we had of it, went hard at all the things, but it felt really wrong.

419
00:36:28,272 --> 00:36:37,994
Like, there was just something off about it, and we were pitching different ways to sort of fix the issues, and the problem was that the opening was wrong.

420
00:36:38,575 --> 00:36:42,796
And the opening, what ended up in the final trailer, actually came out of marketing.

421
00:36:43,536 --> 00:36:48,144
and the need was this, we needed a trailer that would remind the player who the main character of the fox is.

422
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:49,466
Everyone kind of recognized the fox.

423
00:36:49,486 --> 00:36:51,209
So we had a trailer that would remind the player who the main character of the fox is.

424
00:36:51,229 --> 00:36:53,132
Everyone kind of recognized the fox.

425
00:36:53,152 --> 00:36:54,114
So we

426
00:36:55,029 --> 00:36:57,350
but the game had been in development for a very, very long time.

427
00:36:57,991 --> 00:37:05,295
Things go in and out of like common knowledge and we needed to kind of acknowledge that directly to the player.

428
00:37:05,595 --> 00:37:11,879
So what we did was we made a trailer that basically was like, this was like the sentence that came up in the conversation.

429
00:37:11,919 --> 00:37:13,920
It was like, oh hey, it's the little fox.

430
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:14,861
I remember him.

431
00:37:15,181 --> 00:37:16,562
Oh, he waved at me.

432
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:18,771
I played that demo once.

433
00:37:19,211 --> 00:37:19,812
Oh shit!

434
00:37:20,032 --> 00:37:20,933
That's a huge boss!

435
00:37:21,473 --> 00:37:23,255
Like that's literally how we opened that trailer.

436
00:37:23,275 --> 00:37:25,116
And that was like the marketing sentence.

437
00:37:25,757 --> 00:37:27,178
Uh that was the marketing need that we had.

438
00:37:27,198 --> 00:37:28,700
It's like we need to bring them back in.

439
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,261
We need to cheekily wave at them.

440
00:37:31,142 --> 00:37:33,104
Which maybe we can pull off, maybe we can't.

441
00:37:33,444 --> 00:37:36,887
And then like yeah and there's a big effin spider tank.

442
00:37:36,907 --> 00:37:38,008
What's the spider tank's actual name?

443
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:39,905
I don't know.

444
00:37:40,085 --> 00:37:41,326
I call it the spider tank.

445
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:43,827
The big stompy monster.

446
00:37:45,347 --> 00:37:46,288
And he screams.

447
00:37:46,448 --> 00:37:48,028
And then it goes into the hard trailer.

448
00:37:48,489 --> 00:37:49,869
And it was like, look at all the places.

449
00:37:49,889 --> 00:37:51,430
This is how big the scope of this game is.

450
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:57,172
It was one tiny asset, but it was an asset that responded to a need that we saw in the community.

451
00:37:59,727 --> 00:38:03,510
So, part of this is we develop 90 percent assets.

452
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:06,332
And I've talked about this concept before at other GDC talks.

453
00:38:07,133 --> 00:38:12,137
But if you have an understanding of the future deliverable and the constraints of this, you can prep your 90 percent assets.

454
00:38:13,378 --> 00:38:18,542
This is so that when you get that request, you are at the polish phase already.

455
00:38:19,523 --> 00:38:22,846
And you can only make a 90 percent asset if you know what your marketing team needs.

456
00:38:23,546 --> 00:38:24,387
You need a trailer.

457
00:38:24,687 --> 00:38:26,248
It needs to respond to a need.

458
00:38:26,649 --> 00:38:26,829
You've

459
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:36,802
put the development pieces of that into your development schedule well in advance so you can build your marketing asset when it is convenient to you.

460
00:38:41,141 --> 00:38:45,945
We rely on this 100 percent of the time because a 90 percent asset for a trailer is we are mastering a trailer.

461
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:50,568
We are putting on the uh branding, the mnemonics on the side.

462
00:38:51,089 --> 00:38:55,332
We are porting a demo that already exists.

463
00:38:55,873 --> 00:39:00,076
That is a 90 percent asset because we are able to do that on a timeline that doesn't hurt people.

464
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:03,913
It also allows for a more collaborative approach to marketing.

465
00:39:04,393 --> 00:39:12,504
We're able to involve the development team in designing these assets in a way that is conducive to the talent and brilliant minds that are on your development teams.

466
00:39:13,144 --> 00:39:16,509
Because they know the game and you know the market.

467
00:39:19,448 --> 00:39:21,689
because we have to produce these things on better timelines.

468
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:29,190
I work with very small teams and every single one of these initiatives that we've been involved with could hurt people and have hurt people.

469
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:34,531
And your goal at the end of the day is to not burn out your brilliant collaborators that you work with.

470
00:39:35,852 --> 00:39:46,134
Because you've planned and you have prepped and you've done the design work and you've started building the asset well before, it's due because we work in games and everyone has to deliver the same assets.

471
00:39:49,068 --> 00:39:52,689
So, things that I mentioned, we master things in that last 10 percent.

472
00:39:53,849 --> 00:40:01,491
We, um, sometimes have storyboards and placeholders, um, for a trailer and we put it into full production.

473
00:40:01,811 --> 00:40:05,631
Because if you know the beats, you can pull the clips.

474
00:40:06,672 --> 00:40:08,872
Um, and it kinda, it goes real fast if you know what you're building.

475
00:40:09,632 --> 00:40:17,314
Um, for store assets, if you have your key art and your identity done in advance, it's easier to pull the store assets.

476
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:20,391
You can also take final screen shots from your current builds.

477
00:40:22,432 --> 00:40:27,955
The tasks are easier to get full stakeholder buy in if you're already sitting on them and they've already been approved.

478
00:40:29,535 --> 00:40:31,576
Because we polish when we have the final info.

479
00:40:32,517 --> 00:40:43,021
It is possible because marketing asks change regularly, you might be like I'm developing a trailer and next week you're not because the event is gone, it has been cancelled.

480
00:40:44,262 --> 00:40:44,322
If

481
00:40:45,393 --> 00:40:47,274
you are always ready to participate.

482
00:40:47,354 --> 00:40:52,177
It's not a big deal if it's canceled because you have not moved whole development schedules to support it.

483
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:54,658
You just change the final 10 percent.

484
00:40:56,459 --> 00:40:57,980
Because it's so easier.

485
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,121
So, I'm going to talk a little bit about the

486
00:40:59,417 --> 00:41:00,737
are so much easier if you do it that way.

487
00:41:01,578 --> 00:41:04,939
Because for external opportunities, it's always going to be a timeline crunch.

488
00:41:05,319 --> 00:41:06,299
There's no way out of it.

489
00:41:06,379 --> 00:41:07,120
It just is.

490
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,321
They're going to hold on to that news and they're like, okay, we need a trailer in two weeks.

491
00:41:11,361 --> 00:41:14,602
We want a sample of it in 12 days.

492
00:41:14,642 --> 00:41:15,802
I've had worse than that.

493
00:41:16,463 --> 00:41:17,203
I need B-roll.

494
00:41:17,583 --> 00:41:20,564
in 36 hours in some format they've never seen before.

495
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:28,288
This is the crap that comes in and I'm trying to be positive about it but it's just how marketing requests work.

496
00:41:28,548 --> 00:41:30,329
It's just what my email inbox looks like.

497
00:41:30,609 --> 00:41:32,110
It's always going to be a timeline crunch.

498
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:39,773
So if it's going to be a damn timeline crunch, we have to fix our timeline because there's no, that piece is immovable.

499
00:41:40,654 --> 00:41:42,154
So we have to do our things in advance.

500
00:41:42,194 --> 00:41:43,415
We have to talk to our dev teams.

501
00:41:45,765 --> 00:41:47,567
So, how am I doing on time?

502
00:41:47,967 --> 00:41:48,467
I'm good, right?

503
00:41:49,508 --> 00:41:49,848
Okay, good.

504
00:41:50,369 --> 00:41:51,630
Uh, polish less ten percent.

505
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:55,293
I have three examples, um, that I just want to run through.

506
00:41:55,353 --> 00:41:56,654
So, chicory trailer number two.

507
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:59,236
Uh, we launched this thing in February of 2021.

508
00:41:59,356 --> 00:42:03,080
And I'm just going to, I'm just going to tell you when we actually did this asset.

509
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:05,836
because I think it's interesting.

510
00:42:06,196 --> 00:42:08,017
We had our 90% asset done in spring of 2020.

511
00:42:08,437 --> 00:42:15,458
We had a trailer literally done, it hadn't been mastered and it needed to be cut a little bit, slightly too long.

512
00:42:16,018 --> 00:42:18,599
Done in spring of 2020, we just sat on it waiting.

513
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:28,200
We negotiated to put this in at least four different marketing events between spring of 2020 and when it finally was on like the PlayStation blog in 2021.

514
00:42:29,721 --> 00:42:31,381
And we just held onto it.

515
00:42:32,386 --> 00:42:33,326
until we found the right spot.

516
00:42:33,927 --> 00:42:38,889
The tunic combat demo, same thing, with the 90 percent asset done in September of 2020.

517
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:41,190
We did not launch it until June of 2021.

518
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:46,252
Because we had this done, we were able to negotiate an IGN exclusive look at the PC demo.

519
00:42:46,833 --> 00:42:49,734
If we had gone too far, we would never have been able to do that.

520
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:54,977
The IGN exclusive look, that code went out in February of 2021.

521
00:42:56,037 --> 00:42:58,538
That's how early they had access to it.

522
00:42:59,139 --> 00:42:59,859
And if we hadn't

523
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:04,142
Considered that that was a possibility, it would not have been possible.

524
00:43:05,584 --> 00:43:07,045
Same thing with the TUNIC launch trailer.

525
00:43:07,745 --> 00:43:11,308
We started planning and negotiating all of that in January of 2021.

526
00:43:11,388 --> 00:43:17,873
We got Derek Liu, who's done a bunch of, like, GDC, like, he's awesome.

527
00:43:18,454 --> 00:43:22,737
He had the builds of that by the summer, and he was already playing through the builds and pulling things.

528
00:43:23,578 --> 00:43:26,000
And then we were working on storyboards through that whole fall.

529
00:43:28,168 --> 00:43:31,171
This is just, we have to do it this way.

530
00:43:31,392 --> 00:43:34,695
We have to build all this stuff in when we're actually doing the work for it.

531
00:43:35,096 --> 00:43:37,598
And right now I'm doing the same thing on my two unannounced projects.

532
00:43:37,959 --> 00:43:44,526
We are ramping up all of these early marketing assets to make sure that we don't just stop development.

533
00:43:44,766 --> 00:43:45,367
Because we can't do that.

534
00:43:45,407 --> 00:43:47,209
If we stop development, the game doesn't get made on time.

535
00:43:50,851 --> 00:43:55,693
So the questions for your team, why is there a disconnect between your discipline schedules and priorities?

536
00:43:56,753 --> 00:43:58,294
Part of it might be an attitude adjustment.

537
00:43:58,654 --> 00:43:59,495
I mean, it was for us.

538
00:43:59,915 --> 00:44:02,956
Like, if I go in, I'm like, I just need, like, one, don't say just.

539
00:44:03,436 --> 00:44:05,357
But I need this thing, and I need it tomorrow.

540
00:44:05,437 --> 00:44:08,338
It's like, yeah, well, put it on a damn schedule, man.

541
00:44:08,638 --> 00:44:09,419
Like, that sucks.

542
00:44:10,219 --> 00:44:11,479
You know these things are going to be made.

543
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:16,482
So how do we communicate better and have better timelines, even from marketing?

544
00:44:16,802 --> 00:44:19,923
We know what we're going to need, so let's tell our production teams about it early.

545
00:44:20,874 --> 00:44:24,515
and as production teams you know marketing's gonna need stuff so ask them what they need.

546
00:44:25,175 --> 00:44:26,376
When do they think they're gonna need it?

547
00:44:26,576 --> 00:44:28,496
And if they're like, I don't know, be like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

548
00:44:29,797 --> 00:44:31,597
Give me some sample timelines.

549
00:44:31,878 --> 00:44:33,198
What do you think could happen?

550
00:44:33,398 --> 00:44:34,358
Because you can work with that.

551
00:44:35,499 --> 00:44:39,260
How does this limit team good, team collaborative communication?

552
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:45,302
Like, obviously you hate each other and that's like just kind of a miserable environment to work in.

553
00:44:46,325 --> 00:44:51,787
How does your external marketing ask affect your development team's anticipatory pipelines?

554
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:53,027
You don't have them.

555
00:44:53,848 --> 00:45:04,812
If you don't know what's coming, if you don't know what's possible, if you don't know what the marketing team is planning for, or what they're hoping for, what they're dreaming for, you can't build anything to help support it.

556
00:45:07,172 --> 00:45:08,673
How can you control for timelines?

557
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:14,062
You can't control for external timelines.

558
00:45:14,202 --> 00:45:16,263
You can only control for your internal timelines.

559
00:45:16,984 --> 00:45:22,247
What kind of milestones and tasks will you build into your production schedules to address the needs of all of your team?

560
00:45:23,348 --> 00:45:25,730
Find out what the needs are for all of your team.

561
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:27,291
And that has to include marketing.

562
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:28,912
They are designers.

563
00:45:28,992 --> 00:45:34,316
They are designing how your team and how your game is going to be presented to the public.

564
00:45:35,737 --> 00:45:37,698
And build the pipelines for that.

565
00:45:40,834 --> 00:45:42,514
So plan as early as possible.

566
00:45:42,595 --> 00:45:44,335
We spend all of our time in planning.

567
00:45:44,655 --> 00:45:49,156
I don't have a game announced for quite a long time, and we are already building all the assets for it.

568
00:45:49,797 --> 00:45:55,158
This was the same thing for all of our previous projects, because we learned from experience that we're going to hurt people otherwise.

569
00:45:56,459 --> 00:45:57,939
We prepare way in advance.

570
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:05,721
As long as we have slightly too much information, as long as we focus on the things marketing thinks we might need on our development schedules, we build those things.

571
00:46:05,981 --> 00:46:08,022
Then we're sitting on the assets before we need them.

572
00:46:09,901 --> 00:46:14,084
then we produce some better timelines because we are already sitting on everything we need.

573
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:17,186
Because we ask the questions that need to be there.

574
00:46:19,488 --> 00:46:20,449
And this is me.

575
00:46:21,329 --> 00:46:22,851
Eventually that power point will show up.

576
00:46:23,811 --> 00:46:26,633
And I think we do have a few minutes for questions.

577
00:46:28,715 --> 00:46:29,976
And apologies for my power point.

578
00:46:30,216 --> 00:46:31,297
It's been doing some wild things.

579
00:46:31,357 --> 00:46:33,358
There's some slides out of order and I don't know why.

580
00:46:33,899 --> 00:46:35,520
Because they weren't an hour ago.

581
00:46:50,345 --> 00:46:50,765
Oh, sorry.

582
00:46:51,466 --> 00:46:53,387
I will repeat this after you say it.

583
00:46:53,928 --> 00:46:54,568
Great, thank you.

584
00:46:55,429 --> 00:46:59,752
So we talked about production and marketing timelines aligning and I think it's really great.

585
00:47:00,613 --> 00:47:07,998
First question is, do you have dashboards globally across the company that have those two timelines visible?

586
00:47:08,679 --> 00:47:12,262
Okay, so we were just actually talking about this because my husband was giving me a bunch of

587
00:47:13,211 --> 00:47:15,193
Oh yeah, Apollo, shut up.

588
00:47:15,353 --> 00:47:16,894
So do we have global dashboards?

589
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:24,881
So we work in a small company and the answer is yes, but the small version, small company version of this.

590
00:47:25,761 --> 00:47:29,484
We keep most of our information on Notion specifically for our company.

591
00:47:30,965 --> 00:47:35,727
and it works slightly different depending on if it's an internal project or an external project.

592
00:47:36,108 --> 00:47:47,393
So within marketing we do have sort of a like overall look at everything that's going on and then it's actually broken out so for external we usually keep this kind of over in

593
00:47:49,854 --> 00:47:51,334
something that they can actually work with.

594
00:47:51,754 --> 00:47:56,056
And then internal, on our internal project, they can see or see all of the pieces of it.

595
00:47:57,497 --> 00:48:04,340
But yes, the important piece of that though is because it is flexible and it has to be adaptable, things move around a lot.

596
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:05,280
team.

597
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:10,483
I can't expect him, if I change something, to know that I changed it.

598
00:48:11,063 --> 00:48:12,164
He's not going to get that updated.

599
00:48:22,409 --> 00:48:44,761
so if I'm like radically moving lots of things around or some console just emails me and I'm adding a new important highlight for one of our projects it is super important for me to raise that red flag right away because it is going to radically change development and that will come up almost instantly into our every single Monday we do our

600
00:48:45,882 --> 00:48:52,006
sort of creative team stand up, where we do high level discipline breakdowns in all of our creative teams.

601
00:48:52,166 --> 00:48:55,809
And we actually have a whole section that is biz dev and marketing.

602
00:48:56,529 --> 00:48:58,691
So anything that changes gets highlighted right there.

603
00:48:59,692 --> 00:49:05,375
Usually kind of high, if it's really high up and it needs to change anything radically, it gets just higher priority.

604
00:49:05,636 --> 00:49:13,001
But usually at the bottom, anything that I'm gonna bring into that meeting is four to 10 weeks in advance minimum.

605
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,621
because I bring it up immediately.

606
00:49:16,941 --> 00:49:20,042
As soon as I know something, I come in like, I'm pretty certain I'm gonna have to do this.

607
00:49:20,983 --> 00:49:23,264
Here is the breakdown of what I think I'm going to need.

608
00:49:24,045 --> 00:49:25,405
What are we lacking from this?

609
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:28,507
And usually we have the majority of it sitting around.

610
00:49:29,108 --> 00:49:32,910
But yeah, there's a lot of, nothing gets ignored.

611
00:49:33,050 --> 00:49:34,671
As soon as there's a flag, we raise it.

612
00:49:36,492 --> 00:49:37,932
Because otherwise it's never gonna get done.

613
00:49:38,073 --> 00:49:42,155
You're just, yeah, you can't drop stuff like that into people's laps.

614
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:45,922
talk talk talk talk talk talk talk

615
00:49:59,415 --> 00:50:01,857
Oh, I mean the rest of everything.

616
00:50:02,277 --> 00:50:04,579
So what are the other timelines that should be fitting into this?

617
00:50:04,619 --> 00:50:06,400
Like, we have our marketing and production timelines.

618
00:50:06,801 --> 00:50:10,564
We should be talking, like, where is advertising fitting into this?

619
00:50:10,644 --> 00:50:13,346
Like, where is our events and logistics fitting into this?

620
00:50:13,446 --> 00:50:16,568
Like, how is the QA process also on top of this?

621
00:50:16,848 --> 00:50:23,974
We rely on our QA to help us get sort of our final screenshots even at the end of a game.

622
00:50:23,994 --> 00:50:25,655
Like, that's not all on marketing.

623
00:50:26,736 --> 00:50:27,296
Because they know the,

624
00:50:28,410 --> 00:50:36,313
by the time a game launches, our QA team knows the game better than anyone else on the planet, and they're like, I found something really cool, and they will be raising that flag.

625
00:50:36,834 --> 00:50:48,199
Like, everything by the end of this, understand, in our QA stand-ups, we have a whole space for marketing initiatives and, like, biz dev things that need to be highlighted.

626
00:50:49,219 --> 00:50:56,966
It has to, if you're going to have a collaborative communication process, it's holistic and they're working across all of our teams.

627
00:50:57,126 --> 00:51:06,694
You have to be able to have everyone kind of on the same page to raise the important issues, to answer important questions and know when things are going to be due.

628
00:51:06,971 --> 00:51:14,379
if you have a demo, an Xbox demo for example, going live, your QA team needs to know when the hell that needs to go into certification.

629
00:51:14,779 --> 00:51:19,344
Because they're the ones that are overlapping with your porting studio or the engineering team internally who are doing that port.

630
00:51:20,105 --> 00:51:21,826
Like, it has to be there.

631
00:51:23,148 --> 00:51:23,448
Thank you.

632
00:51:23,568 --> 00:51:23,889
Yeah, of course.

633
00:51:24,169 --> 00:51:25,050
I'll be back in a minute.

634
00:51:30,063 --> 00:51:30,343
whatever.

635
00:51:30,784 --> 00:51:31,825
Hi, great talk, Rebecca.

636
00:51:32,385 --> 00:51:34,868
First of all, is your studio based in Grand Rapids?

637
00:51:35,148 --> 00:51:35,529
It is.

638
00:51:35,849 --> 00:51:36,249
Small world.

639
00:51:36,349 --> 00:51:37,430
I'm from Hastings, Michigan.

640
00:51:37,471 --> 00:51:38,251
Oh, no kidding.

641
00:51:38,451 --> 00:51:38,632
Yeah.

642
00:51:39,032 --> 00:51:39,152
Great.

643
00:51:39,212 --> 00:51:40,494
I'm from Fallerville, Michigan.

644
00:51:40,534 --> 00:51:41,374
Can I say that out loud?

645
00:51:41,615 --> 00:51:44,838
The wildest, smallest town in Michigan.

646
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:47,379
Great.

647
00:51:48,259 --> 00:51:48,820
One question for you.

648
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:52,220
I'm working on a team that is just about to move into pre-production.

649
00:51:52,980 --> 00:52:04,442
And we're just starting to set up some rituals with our marketing team and our production team to make sure that we're just aligned in our goals and that we're setting up milestones that reflect a shared vision instead of separate goals on separate tracks.

650
00:52:05,042 --> 00:52:11,224
What sort of rituals did you find to be successful for your team to ensure solid, cohesive communication between the two groups?

651
00:52:12,424 --> 00:52:13,264
Oh, that's a good question.

652
00:52:16,410 --> 00:52:23,021
Okay, so one caveat, I run biz marketing and my husband runs creative, but we do work with external teams.

653
00:52:25,069 --> 00:52:40,192
Adam and I have a really, just a really good communication process because he got so sick of me coming in with marketing things and because we obviously have a very close relationship, he was like, this effing sucks, we need to have a better process for this.

654
00:52:41,693 --> 00:52:47,534
The main thing, one of the main things we did right away is like we, one, we never bash marketing.

655
00:52:48,354 --> 00:52:52,896
We can be upset about the fact that we have to do something on a timeline.

656
00:52:53,656 --> 00:52:58,858
We can be frustrated by the fact that somebody has external requests of us.

657
00:52:59,618 --> 00:53:05,200
Um, but the people who are answering those emails and making those requests out of line to go after them.

658
00:53:06,161 --> 00:53:09,702
Uh, and that sort of, like that alone builds a lot of trust.

659
00:53:09,742 --> 00:53:11,603
So if somebody's like I need to do this

660
00:53:12,603 --> 00:53:17,565
and it is on a tight timeline and I need you development team to help me with this.

661
00:53:18,065 --> 00:53:25,108
It's like I understand that you have an external request because you're on a different timeline than I am on.

662
00:53:25,428 --> 00:53:33,971
And like that baseline respect for each other's disciplines has gone a long way, thank you, a long way to sort of alleviate a lot of the issues.

663
00:53:34,031 --> 00:53:35,772
And it is done by example.

664
00:53:36,712 --> 00:53:40,794
But in doing so we've also included like in our marketing teams we talk about development.

665
00:53:41,534 --> 00:53:44,135
in our development creative teams, we talk about marketing.

666
00:53:44,435 --> 00:53:56,437
We raise the important things that each team is doing to make sure that people are understanding that we are on different schedules regularly, but also that we are working towards the same thing together.

667
00:53:56,517 --> 00:54:01,819
Because marketing is designing how your game is going to land, and the game designers are designing the game.

668
00:54:02,439 --> 00:54:06,860
And they don't have access to the end user the way a marketing team does.

669
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:09,440
Thank you so much.

670
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:10,481
Does that answer your question?

671
00:54:10,601 --> 00:54:10,861
It does.

672
00:54:10,981 --> 00:54:11,442
OK, cool.

673
00:54:13,703 --> 00:54:14,623
Hi.

674
00:54:14,704 --> 00:54:17,165
You almost answered my question.

675
00:54:17,225 --> 00:54:29,012
Is you have any tip on how you deal with, I mean, when the development team is too much involved on the marketing decisions.

676
00:54:29,412 --> 00:54:34,635
So it's not the same an in-game,

677
00:54:36,792 --> 00:54:37,793
Yeah, no, I know this.

678
00:54:38,573 --> 00:54:40,494
Or that a trailer is not the same.

679
00:54:40,594 --> 00:54:43,276
Here, in-game, you want a lot of new screen data.

680
00:54:43,316 --> 00:54:49,659
Marketing here, so the good thing of, you know, probably this year, the marketing, that everyone knows about marketing.

681
00:54:50,199 --> 00:54:53,201
So we are so lucky that we receive advice from everyone.

682
00:54:53,821 --> 00:55:00,965
So how do you deal with that, say, like you were saying, I have knowledge and I have numbers that you probably don't know.

683
00:55:01,325 --> 00:55:03,046
How do you handle that?

684
00:55:03,086 --> 00:55:03,947
How do you manage that?

685
00:55:04,247 --> 00:55:05,548
Yeah, so the question is,

686
00:55:08,337 --> 00:55:12,980
when somebody is kind of outside their lane, basically.

687
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:24,947
Like when you have a dev team who is like, I know more about the way a trailer should be than you do, or I know more about the, honestly, for the marketing team in here,

688
00:55:26,158 --> 00:55:28,899
Be real careful going in and having opinions on mechanics.

689
00:55:29,679 --> 00:55:32,460
Do you know more about that than the people who do this every day?

690
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:34,180
And the answer is yes, sometimes you do.

691
00:55:34,861 --> 00:55:35,501
That is true.

692
00:55:35,701 --> 00:55:38,542
You are often, you should be part of that conversation.

693
00:55:39,422 --> 00:55:41,462
I had a really funny, sorry, real quick tangent.

694
00:55:41,903 --> 00:55:52,946
A friend was giving a talk at GDC this week and their marketing team came in to try to change their stuff to have a bunch of talking points in it and it's just like, stay in your lane, you can't do that to a GDC talk.

695
00:55:57,071 --> 00:55:59,652
the, where's your actual expertise at?

696
00:55:59,992 --> 00:56:08,977
But, very specifically, how do we ensure that development doesn't change the actual, like, sort of design work and the needs from marketing team?

697
00:56:09,437 --> 00:56:11,178
And this comes out in the planning process.

698
00:56:11,238 --> 00:56:25,105
The second that we try to do this too fast, now we are in, we're in a situation where we cannot solve things with time and discussion, and we have to make a decision based on ego and, I don't know, fury.

699
00:56:26,025 --> 00:56:26,286
talk.

700
00:56:26,506 --> 00:56:41,266
The longer that you have to discuss this, to plan, to identify, to share research, the better able you are to build a thing that actually identifies the needs of the market, to be responsive of a thing.

701
00:56:42,187 --> 00:56:44,068
you have more time to build your case.

702
00:56:44,328 --> 00:56:50,532
And nobody's coming into something stressed and hot and mad because you've already imploded a development schedule.

703
00:56:50,772 --> 00:56:52,553
Which is another reason why we do this early.

704
00:56:52,993 --> 00:56:59,897
Because building something on a tight timeline is going to introduce those, they're just ego decisions.

705
00:57:00,818 --> 00:57:01,478
I know best.

706
00:57:01,878 --> 00:57:02,639
It's my game.

707
00:57:02,659 --> 00:57:03,039
I know best.

708
00:57:03,059 --> 00:57:03,439
It's my game.

709
00:57:03,843 --> 00:57:05,223
I know the lore better.

710
00:57:05,383 --> 00:57:08,284
And it's sort of like when you get a pitch and it's all lore.

711
00:57:08,644 --> 00:57:09,624
You're like, no, no, no, baby.

712
00:57:09,644 --> 00:57:10,405
You're just too close.

713
00:57:10,425 --> 00:57:11,365
You've got the blinders on.

714
00:57:11,385 --> 00:57:14,726
You've got to take a step back and tell me what's actually cool about your game, because it's not that.

715
00:57:17,006 --> 00:57:23,788
It's the same very human feeling, is to take a step back.

716
00:57:24,368 --> 00:57:25,628
You probably don't know best.

717
00:57:25,688 --> 00:57:29,169
And you do need to look at it with really calm, sensible eyes.

718
00:57:29,929 --> 00:57:30,810
But yeah, time.

719
00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:32,030
Time and planning.

720
00:57:33,322 --> 00:57:33,582
Thank you.

721
00:57:33,702 --> 00:57:34,102
You're welcome.

722
00:57:35,223 --> 00:57:35,984
I think I have one question.

723
00:57:36,004 --> 00:57:36,704
Can I do one more question?

724
00:57:36,964 --> 00:57:37,164
OK.

725
00:57:38,585 --> 00:57:39,165
Hi, Rebecca.

726
00:57:39,425 --> 00:57:40,486
Thank you so much for the talk.

727
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:45,629
My background's in development, but I work in marketing now, so I feel very seen by this.

728
00:57:46,549 --> 00:57:57,776
My question for you is, for our team, we've been focusing a lot on tool development for my marketing team for how we can capture the build or take some of the work off the dev team and do that.

729
00:57:57,896 --> 00:58:01,018
And I wanted to know if you had any thoughts about how you've handled that at Fingy.

730
00:58:02,474 --> 00:58:06,818
For tool development, well we're small enough they don't have a ton of it.

731
00:58:07,798 --> 00:58:20,148
However, we do have a lot of discussions sort of at like a top level of we are going to have to support this thing and who is available to help support it.

732
00:58:21,509 --> 00:58:25,812
Because there are people who are infinitely qualified especially for capturing builds.

733
00:58:26,532 --> 00:58:43,610
or they have to like run things in unity or I'm going to have to run it on device so I'm like capture carding with the QA team to pull that because like my marketing team doesn't have a damn dev kit sitting around and I have to run this off of a PS5 in the office and that's off a capture card.

734
00:58:44,451 --> 00:58:48,535
We plan this stuff so far in advance that like we don't

735
00:58:50,126 --> 00:58:56,326
we put it into pockets and that's our way around these legitimate bottleneck

736
00:58:58,101 --> 00:58:58,522
moments.

737
00:58:59,182 --> 00:59:00,983
But we do have to get buy-in from everybody.

738
00:59:01,083 --> 00:59:04,304
I can't just go into QA and be like, I need fill in the blank.

739
00:59:04,364 --> 00:59:05,125
I can't have that.

740
00:59:05,545 --> 00:59:07,366
It does need to be like this scheduled thing.

741
00:59:07,426 --> 00:59:13,308
And because it's not their main job, it might be they spend a couple hours capturing something very exact.

742
00:59:14,089 --> 00:59:16,770
Because we usually map out, we need this exact thing.

743
00:59:16,810 --> 00:59:18,511
We would like it to look like this.

744
00:59:19,071 --> 00:59:21,292
And can you provide a couple of options of this?

745
00:59:22,413 --> 00:59:24,554
Can you go through this boss scene like three times?

746
00:59:25,214 --> 00:59:30,317
and for them, they're like, hell yeah, I can definitely do that because I can do that boss scene with my eyes closed.

747
00:59:31,557 --> 00:59:41,443
We also will use like internal to the build itself, we have a whole bunch of depending on what we're doing, we'll script out whole scenes of things.

748
00:59:41,723 --> 00:59:44,004
If we have to capture it on device, we'll like push that into

749
00:59:44,758 --> 00:59:47,759
the build for marketing itself, because it has to be run on device.

750
00:59:48,219 --> 00:59:53,761
So like Fox Waving, for example, that was a scripted scene that Andrew put together that we pushed through and then captured off.

751
00:59:54,601 --> 00:59:56,462
And we do a lot of that.

752
00:59:56,602 --> 00:59:59,483
But we do have to, we spell out, we would like to do this.

753
00:59:59,863 --> 01:00:01,744
We would like the camera to pan like this.

754
01:00:02,404 --> 01:00:13,008
And we spec that out, scope it out, and then talk to our dev teams to see when in the schedule can that be available, and what debug menu can we access to be able to pull that.

755
01:00:14,381 --> 01:00:15,763
but usually done pretty far in advance.

756
01:00:16,223 --> 01:00:21,228
And oftentimes, especially in some of our past stuff, both chicory and tunic especially,

757
01:00:23,427 --> 01:00:28,612
A lot of it was already being thought about, of like, it would look real cool like this, it would be cool if we could spin it like this.

758
01:00:30,253 --> 01:00:44,186
And they were already asking those questions, kind of, of us for future marketing asks, because they knew, I'm going to have to make a trailer of this eventually, and I don't want to be ambushed with weird camera cuts or something.

759
01:00:45,206 --> 01:00:45,927
Does that answer your question?

760
01:00:46,227 --> 01:00:46,528
It does.

761
01:00:46,628 --> 01:00:46,968
Thank you.

762
01:00:47,088 --> 01:00:47,408
Yeah, of course.

763
01:00:48,717 --> 01:00:50,520
Okay, I think that's all we have time for.

764
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:54,826
I can go over to wrap up if anyone wants to pick my brain about whatever.

765
01:00:55,126 --> 01:00:55,747
I'm cool with that.

766
01:00:56,328 --> 01:01:00,114
Um, and wrap up is windows on that side of the building.

767
01:01:00,775 --> 01:01:02,698
Um, but yeah, thanks.
