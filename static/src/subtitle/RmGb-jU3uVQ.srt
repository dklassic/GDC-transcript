00:00:02,977 --> 00:00:09,259
Welcome, thanks for coming. My name is Jake Clark, and I'm one of the animators, designers,

2
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:16,521
concept artists, and idea people on the upcoming indie game Cuphead, which is still not out

3
00:00:16,561 --> 00:00:22,243
yet. Apparently games take a long time to make. Nobody told us, so sorry. But you'll

4
00:00:22,283 --> 00:00:24,883
find out very soon why it's been taking so damn long.

5
00:00:27,025 --> 00:00:29,326
So, a little bit about me.

6
00:00:29,626 --> 00:00:32,987
I went to school at Capilano University in Vancouver.

7
00:00:33,647 --> 00:00:35,548
I was trained in traditional paper animation.

8
00:00:37,988 --> 00:00:42,230
If anybody's interested in learning 2D animation, Capilano University in Vancouver is amazing.

9
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:43,670
I definitely wouldn't be here without it.

10
00:00:45,231 --> 00:00:50,353
So after graduating, I worked on a few 2D cartoons in Vancouver's TV animation industry.

11
00:00:50,913 --> 00:00:56,315
Mother Up for Hulu, Turbo F-A-S-T for Netflix, Breadwinners for Nickelodeon.

12
00:00:57,467 --> 00:01:00,428
And then out of nowhere one day I got hired to work on Cuphead,

13
00:01:00,468 --> 00:01:03,410
and I've been doing that for two years now, or a little bit over two years.

14
00:01:05,311 --> 00:01:08,814
And it's actually my first job in video games, and I feel very lucky.

15
00:01:10,475 --> 00:01:11,235
So what is Cuphead?

16
00:01:11,355 --> 00:01:14,557
It's a 2D action game.

17
00:01:14,697 --> 00:01:20,140
The gameplay is inspired by games like Gunstar Heroes, Contra Hardcore,

18
00:01:20,521 --> 00:01:23,442
Metal Slug, just games from the 16-bit era.

19
00:01:25,162 --> 00:01:27,704
and it's styled to look like a 1930s cartoon,

20
00:01:28,065 --> 00:01:30,887
like Betty Boop, Popeye, old Mickey Mouse cartoons,

21
00:01:30,927 --> 00:01:31,388
that kind of thing.

22
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:35,392
It's the love child of Chad and Jared Moldenhauer,

23
00:01:35,532 --> 00:01:37,434
who were my bosses, and they grew up

24
00:01:37,974 --> 00:01:39,496
playing those kind of games

25
00:01:39,556 --> 00:01:40,897
and watching those kind of cartoons.

26
00:01:41,738 --> 00:01:44,000
And that's why the game looks and plays like it does.

27
00:01:45,562 --> 00:01:48,765
We animate it and ink it on paper, traditionally.

28
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,643
and the backgrounds are traditional watercolor paintings,

29
00:01:54,224 --> 00:01:58,508
the music is live recorded by a big jazz band.

30
00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:01,531
So we're really going all out to make it as authentic

31
00:02:01,591 --> 00:02:02,972
to how they would have done it,

32
00:02:03,553 --> 00:02:05,114
how they would have made a game in the 30s

33
00:02:05,174 --> 00:02:07,877
as we possibly can without going overboard.

34
00:02:09,558 --> 00:02:11,981
So I'll show you the trailer we released in 2015

35
00:02:12,621 --> 00:02:16,185
to give you a much better idea of what this game's about.

36
00:03:17,408 --> 00:03:17,968
Don't do the math.

37
00:03:21,611 --> 00:03:22,532
Thank you very much.

38
00:03:26,776 --> 00:03:31,520
So this is the mermaid mask that you just saw, and I'll take you through her being just

39
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,982
an idea to a finished design that's ready to animate.

40
00:03:38,649 --> 00:03:41,390
So first of all is just what makes a 1930s design.

41
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,730
So these are what I always keep in mind when designing.

42
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,011
I just kind of, they're just broad general rules

43
00:03:47,031 --> 00:03:48,292
that I try to follow whenever I'm doing

44
00:03:48,372 --> 00:03:49,432
any kind of design for the game.

45
00:03:50,472 --> 00:03:53,313
Of course, any rule can be broken, but for the most part.

46
00:03:53,893 --> 00:03:56,554
30s designs usually air towards simplicity.

47
00:03:57,374 --> 00:03:59,354
They don't tend to make overly detailed designs.

48
00:04:00,955 --> 00:04:02,175
They're usually made of solid shapes.

49
00:04:03,235 --> 00:04:05,136
And why I think that's really important is that,

50
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:13,397
Like any 30s design can be turned in space perfectly without needing to do any kind of

51
00:04:13,457 --> 00:04:13,777
cheats.

52
00:04:14,758 --> 00:04:18,642
So you're almost like trying to draw a 3D model in a way.

53
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:20,384
So it's not like a...

54
00:04:21,364 --> 00:04:23,985
A lot of modern cartoons, like, has anybody here seen Clone High?

55
00:04:24,906 --> 00:04:29,789
Which is a fantastic show, but it has a lot of, like, stylized corners and edges on characters

56
00:04:29,849 --> 00:04:36,592
and things that, like, you wouldn't be able to turn Abe from Clone High, like, 20 degrees

57
00:04:36,612 --> 00:04:37,833
to the left, if you know what I mean.

58
00:04:38,633 --> 00:04:44,316
He just has a lot of stylistic tricks, and they don't really translate that well to three-dimensional

59
00:04:44,336 --> 00:04:44,616
turns.

60
00:04:45,907 --> 00:04:50,870
A lot of most 3D characters are usually pretty rounded, a lot of round shapes, round lines.

61
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:58,273
Sometimes sharp fingers, sometimes sharp hair or sharp hat, but for the most part a lot

62
00:04:58,293 --> 00:04:58,833
of round shapes.

63
00:04:59,914 --> 00:05:03,635
And then the term I'm sure everybody's heard of is rubber hose, which is sort of like...

64
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,952
Most of the characters are almost like they're made of rubber.

65
00:05:08,192 --> 00:05:13,057
Both in that you can really stretch them a lot and squash them and play with them in

66
00:05:13,077 --> 00:05:18,182
that way when you're animating, but also a lot of them have kind of bendy tube limbs.

67
00:05:20,304 --> 00:05:24,087
And lastly, limited features.

68
00:05:24,187 --> 00:05:28,271
By that I mean, we're trying to make this game look like a 30s cartoon.

69
00:05:30,045 --> 00:05:30,966
And how do we do that?

70
00:05:31,246 --> 00:05:33,889
We do it by referencing all the different shapes

71
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:35,470
that they used to use in the 30s,

72
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:36,971
the different way they drew hands,

73
00:05:37,011 --> 00:05:38,132
the different way they drew eyes.

74
00:05:38,953 --> 00:05:41,615
So in a way, when you're designing for a 30s cartoon,

75
00:05:41,735 --> 00:05:44,117
it's almost like Frankensteining together a design,

76
00:05:44,157 --> 00:05:45,379
in a sense, not entirely,

77
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:50,603
but most characters have a certain way of doing things.

78
00:05:52,445 --> 00:05:54,406
So the first thing I do before starting a design

79
00:05:54,446 --> 00:05:55,487
is just think, think, think.

80
00:05:58,119 --> 00:06:00,060
Yeah, I think about what would contrast the other bosses,

81
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,961
because we want all the different bosses in the game

82
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:03,681
to be very unique to each other.

83
00:06:04,802 --> 00:06:06,223
And what has been done already,

84
00:06:06,383 --> 00:06:08,123
both in our game and in other games,

85
00:06:08,223 --> 00:06:09,424
because we don't want to do anything

86
00:06:09,444 --> 00:06:10,284
that's been done before.

87
00:06:11,645 --> 00:06:13,366
And then what would excite me is the players.

88
00:06:13,466 --> 00:06:16,307
So I actually imagine myself playing the game.

89
00:06:16,327 --> 00:06:18,928
I try to see in my head the little cuphead guy

90
00:06:18,988 --> 00:06:19,988
running around, shooting,

91
00:06:20,909 --> 00:06:23,230
and try to imagine what it would be exciting

92
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,250
to actually interact with.

93
00:06:25,747 --> 00:06:27,969
And then I think, what would I enjoy animating?

94
00:06:28,869 --> 00:06:30,391
Because of course you want your design

95
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:31,792
to be as good as possible,

96
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:36,396
but you don't want to put in ridiculous amounts of detail

97
00:06:36,436 --> 00:06:40,079
that make it very hard to turn in space and to animate.

98
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,302
For example, I'm showing you how to design the mermaid.

99
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:45,684
One of my early concepts, or one of my early ideas

100
00:06:45,744 --> 00:06:48,506
was to have a pirate ship on her head.

101
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:53,451
And if you imagine trying to animate that and turn that in space, it would not be a great time.

102
00:06:54,012 --> 00:06:58,154
So, you want to be animating something that you enjoy, your animation is going to be better,

103
00:06:58,214 --> 00:06:59,975
it's not going to be as much of a headache.

104
00:07:00,696 --> 00:07:03,638
Like if you're trying to do a 3D animation with a rig that you hate,

105
00:07:03,718 --> 00:07:07,300
your animation is just not going to be as good as if you're using a rig that you like, right?

106
00:07:08,621 --> 00:07:11,142
And then I think, what would have lots of gameplay and animation potential?

107
00:07:11,242 --> 00:07:16,686
So, I just want the character to be capable of a broad range of...

108
00:07:17,795 --> 00:07:20,017
gestures with the body and

109
00:07:21,238 --> 00:07:24,460
Actual subject matter of like what the attacks would be

110
00:07:26,642 --> 00:07:28,424
So these are the very first designs that I did

111
00:07:28,444 --> 00:07:33,527
So I was going for strong fierce wild magic magical

112
00:07:34,248 --> 00:07:37,971
I wanted her to have octopus hair and look as if she ate pirate ships

113
00:07:39,247 --> 00:07:46,232
So I first did these before doing any reference, which, like, reference is very important,

114
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:51,235
but I do think there's kind of a value to taking a swing at something, like a design

115
00:07:51,275 --> 00:07:59,381
or an animation, before you reference, just because prior to referencing, you have an

116
00:07:59,481 --> 00:08:04,665
idea in your head of what this thing is that's based on everything that you've seen.

117
00:08:05,145 --> 00:08:05,625
So for this...

118
00:08:06,743 --> 00:08:09,266
The idea in my head is based on all the mermaids I've seen,

119
00:08:09,326 --> 00:08:11,128
all the strong characters I've seen,

120
00:08:11,768 --> 00:08:13,470
both in cartoons, games, and real life,

121
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:14,851
all the fierce things I've seen,

122
00:08:14,871 --> 00:08:16,793
all the wild and magical things I've seen, and so on.

123
00:08:17,474 --> 00:08:18,474
So everyone in this room,

124
00:08:19,876 --> 00:08:21,958
if tasked with designing a mermaid,

125
00:08:22,498 --> 00:08:25,141
everybody has a unique idea right off the bat.

126
00:08:26,314 --> 00:08:31,115
And it's very rare that you would just hammer out a design

127
00:08:31,475 --> 00:08:33,676
without doing any reference and have that be the final design.

128
00:08:33,856 --> 00:08:38,737
But I do think it's something valuable to starting

129
00:08:38,757 --> 00:08:39,297
without reference.

130
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:43,378
So I got some notes back to try her

131
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,259
to look a little bit more like Betty Boop

132
00:08:45,319 --> 00:08:46,599
or a little bit more like Olive Oil.

133
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:48,380
So I looked at.

134
00:08:49,415 --> 00:08:50,815
What makes Betty Boop Betty Boop?

135
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,835
I looked at the shape of her eyes,

136
00:08:52,955 --> 00:08:55,156
and she has a tiny nose and tiny mouth,

137
00:08:55,236 --> 00:08:56,916
and I thought quite a bit of that

138
00:08:56,956 --> 00:08:58,637
could apply to the mermaid design.

139
00:08:59,537 --> 00:09:00,857
I didn't really look at Olive Oil.

140
00:09:00,877 --> 00:09:04,198
I just didn't really think that she fit that well.

141
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:04,818
Sorry, Chad.

142
00:09:06,198 --> 00:09:09,039
And then I opened up reference to other games

143
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:12,339
or other characters that I thought could help,

144
00:09:12,539 --> 00:09:14,460
like Eliza from Fantastic Journey,

145
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,780
which is where I got the pirate ship on the head idea.

146
00:09:18,478 --> 00:09:22,761
Splash Woman from Mega Man 9, and then, oh, I was also told to try some different things

147
00:09:22,801 --> 00:09:24,362
on her head, other than the octopus hair.

148
00:09:25,403 --> 00:09:28,304
And I just felt Wonder Woman sort of fitted the vibe that I was going for.

149
00:09:31,246 --> 00:09:35,129
So then I did some of these where I was experimenting with what she's wearing on her head.

150
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:38,471
A lot of these have those Betty Boop kind of eyes.

151
00:09:40,432 --> 00:09:41,553
And quite a few of her features.

152
00:09:41,593 --> 00:09:43,714
She's definitely the primary reference for the character.

153
00:09:47,665 --> 00:09:51,286
Yeah, most of these designs are just heads,

154
00:09:51,487 --> 00:09:53,987
which in hindsight I probably would have done

155
00:09:54,047 --> 00:09:57,608
more full body designs, but this was two years ago

156
00:09:57,628 --> 00:09:59,629
and I'm a growing boy, still learning.

157
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:06,371
So then Chad, who is the art director on Cuphead,

158
00:10:06,471 --> 00:10:08,092
he took a couple of the drawings

159
00:10:08,132 --> 00:10:09,592
and he just played around with,

160
00:10:09,872 --> 00:10:11,292
maybe she could have skinnier arms,

161
00:10:11,353 --> 00:10:13,673
maybe she could have different hands.

162
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:18,232
And then on the bottom left is just a drawing of his where he was experimenting with some

163
00:10:18,272 --> 00:10:18,892
of his ideas.

164
00:10:20,033 --> 00:10:23,635
Then he gave me, there's a girl from the Moth and the Flame on the top right.

165
00:10:23,935 --> 00:10:27,357
We thought she has a cool kind of eyes that could fit the character.

166
00:10:28,478 --> 00:10:35,182
And then I was mentioning I wanted her to be a bit thicker, so they gave me an early

167
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:39,104
Betty Boop design where she's a bit thicker too to reference proportions.

168
00:10:41,082 --> 00:10:45,285
So yeah, anything that they can possibly reference, anything we can reference, we just do it.

169
00:10:47,187 --> 00:10:50,029
There's no reason not to. We, of course, don't steal stuff,

170
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:54,994
but you got a reference if you want to make it look like a specific style, of course.

171
00:10:56,395 --> 00:10:56,795
So,

172
00:10:57,856 --> 00:10:59,658
they went with the octopus hair, which I was very happy about.

173
00:11:00,847 --> 00:11:05,490
And then yeah, I did just a couple full bodies and a couple of heads.

174
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:09,393
I find that the longer the design process goes on, the fewer drawings you have to do

175
00:11:09,413 --> 00:11:13,877
because you start out trying to figure out what it's going to be.

176
00:11:14,117 --> 00:11:15,558
Like what's the subject matter?

177
00:11:15,898 --> 00:11:16,859
What kind of mermaid?

178
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,000
What does she have on her head?

179
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:18,661
And so on.

180
00:11:19,501 --> 00:11:24,665
And then you kind of get to just specifically just.

181
00:11:25,711 --> 00:11:28,614
how big are different things, how big are her eyes, and things like that.

182
00:11:28,634 --> 00:11:30,295
So you kind of narrow it down, and you just...

183
00:11:30,776 --> 00:11:32,017
and I find I get a better sense of

184
00:11:33,118 --> 00:11:34,319
what they want as time goes on.

185
00:11:36,722 --> 00:11:39,844
And so they chose the one on the left here,

186
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,627
and Chad did a different chest piece,

187
00:11:43,007 --> 00:11:45,149
it's a little bit more like Ariel from Little Mermaid.

188
00:11:46,694 --> 00:11:52,557
And then this is actually the final design. We don't, or I can't actually speak for the other animators, but

189
00:11:53,918 --> 00:12:00,321
before animating I don't make, we don't make like a full turnaround model sheet kind of thing. We tend to

190
00:12:01,522 --> 00:12:07,805
kind of treat the idol as the model sheet because everything goes into the idol, everything comes out of the idol and

191
00:12:08,005 --> 00:12:11,747
generally in the 30s those cartoons weren't super strict about models like

192
00:12:13,028 --> 00:12:16,090
like a Disney princess cartoon would be. It's very different.

193
00:12:17,865 --> 00:12:21,906
So I'll show you the process in doing her idle animation.

194
00:12:24,027 --> 00:12:28,728
So the first thing is I just like to figure it out before I start drawing.

195
00:12:29,108 --> 00:12:30,129
As much as I can, anyways.

196
00:12:32,329 --> 00:12:35,570
Because we're animating on paper, the stakes are pretty high.

197
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:40,471
Like, if you're ten hours into an animation and you find out that you made a critical

198
00:12:40,531 --> 00:12:43,112
error, it's going to be a really, really long night.

199
00:12:44,853 --> 00:12:47,435
You want to know that it's going to work as early as you can.

200
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,617
And it's just way harder to change things

201
00:12:50,677 --> 00:12:51,497
if you're doing it on paper.

202
00:12:52,558 --> 00:12:53,499
So I just visualize.

203
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:56,461
I just try to imagine, try to see in my head what would work,

204
00:12:59,443 --> 00:13:01,064
what has been done before, and so on.

205
00:13:01,964 --> 00:13:04,526
And then I act it out.

206
00:13:04,546 --> 00:13:07,228
I don't really think of it as acting.

207
00:13:07,268 --> 00:13:10,830
It's more like a little kid running around in the sandbox

208
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,151
pretending they're a monster kind of thing.

209
00:13:12,551 --> 00:13:13,812
And then you just.

210
00:13:15,292 --> 00:13:16,272
Yeah, I wouldn't call that acting.

211
00:13:16,572 --> 00:13:20,193
But it's just a really good way to get a starting point.

212
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:27,014
You just try things, because a lot of what you're going to be

213
00:13:27,114 --> 00:13:29,715
animating is going to have a head.

214
00:13:29,795 --> 00:13:30,795
It's going to have arms.

215
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:31,695
It's going to have legs.

216
00:13:31,855 --> 00:13:33,616
Even if it doesn't, you can still use your body.

217
00:13:34,556 --> 00:13:36,736
You can kind of use your body as a tool just to test

218
00:13:37,476 --> 00:13:39,637
different animations on the fly, just to get a starting

219
00:13:39,657 --> 00:13:43,197
point, and then points to hit.

220
00:13:43,317 --> 00:13:44,538
So what I mean by that is that.

221
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,363
I try to figure out what is non-negotiable.

222
00:13:50,503 --> 00:13:53,165
What is definitely, what needs to be in this animation.

223
00:13:54,226 --> 00:13:57,208
For example, for the mermaid, she's swimming in the water.

224
00:13:58,429 --> 00:14:02,192
The background is panning, so she's always moving, she's swimming, and so that means

225
00:14:02,953 --> 00:14:05,334
for sure she has to do like a hip sway.

226
00:14:05,575 --> 00:14:06,075
She has to.

227
00:14:06,976 --> 00:14:11,840
So instead of worrying about what she's going to do with her lower half of her body.

228
00:14:14,298 --> 00:14:17,041
it's more just how is she going to sway her hips, because I already know

229
00:14:17,421 --> 00:14:18,663
that she's definitely going to sway her hips.

230
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:19,984
And then

231
00:14:20,004 --> 00:14:20,044
uh...

232
00:14:22,546 --> 00:14:25,249
also another point that I needed to make sure to hit is that

233
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:27,652
she needs her hands to be at the ready

234
00:14:28,152 --> 00:14:31,616
because if you're fighting a tiny plane that's flying around, you need your hands

235
00:14:31,696 --> 00:14:32,557
ready to do things.

236
00:14:33,337 --> 00:14:35,580
You don't see a boxer go into a fight with their

237
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:36,761
hands behind their back.

238
00:14:38,662 --> 00:14:41,003
And then I wanted it to have a dance-ish kind of quality,

239
00:14:41,023 --> 00:14:42,424
because a lot of 30s cartoons,

240
00:14:43,464 --> 00:14:45,986
a lot of the characters are sort of dancing and bobbing

241
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:48,547
most of the time, really.

242
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:50,348
So a lot of the animations in Cuphead

243
00:14:50,368 --> 00:14:51,769
have a sort of dance-like quality.

244
00:14:53,089 --> 00:14:55,471
And then I thumbnail and reference generally,

245
00:14:55,671 --> 00:14:56,931
but I did not for this one.

246
00:14:57,051 --> 00:14:58,792
I felt like I had a good enough idea,

247
00:14:59,593 --> 00:15:01,454
and I just kind of started going straight into the rough,

248
00:15:01,494 --> 00:15:03,115
but usually I would thumbnail and reference.

249
00:15:03,175 --> 00:15:04,075
Those are very good ideas.

250
00:15:06,174 --> 00:15:09,015
So this is the first drawings that I did for the idol.

251
00:15:09,935 --> 00:15:10,955
I leave it pretty damn rough.

252
00:15:11,596 --> 00:15:12,836
Or these are done in blue pencil.

253
00:15:13,136 --> 00:15:14,197
Can't really tell, of course.

254
00:15:16,218 --> 00:15:19,139
But I leave it super rough just because I don't want it to be a huge time

255
00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:19,599
commitment.

256
00:15:20,779 --> 00:15:23,961
So in case I have to do it again, it's not that big of a deal.

257
00:15:24,721 --> 00:15:27,022
But I just want to clearly communicate exactly what's going on.

258
00:15:31,946 --> 00:15:37,531
And then I took those same four drawings and I tied them down into the final model.

259
00:15:37,551 --> 00:15:38,552
So this is the final design.

260
00:15:38,672 --> 00:15:44,938
I added little nubs on the tentacles at the top and scales on the bottom and all that.

261
00:15:44,978 --> 00:15:48,641
But I want to have a solid skeleton to work off of.

262
00:15:49,462 --> 00:15:51,564
So I want to just lock it down in a few drawings.

263
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:53,846
Keep in mind how all the different elements are going to move.

264
00:15:55,409 --> 00:16:01,792
And it's, again, my kind of, the hardest part of animation for me is the entire time before

265
00:16:01,912 --> 00:16:03,252
I know that it's going to work.

266
00:16:04,353 --> 00:16:07,534
So I just want to lock it down, make sure that it's going to work, and then the rest

267
00:16:07,854 --> 00:16:11,216
is just, it's a lot less stressful that way.

268
00:16:12,937 --> 00:16:14,157
So then I did four breakdowns.

269
00:16:14,177 --> 00:16:16,438
I'm not here to tell you what breakdowns are.

270
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:24,162
You know, I emphasize the drag of the tentacles and offset limbs and all that stuff.

271
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:29,682
And then I did eight more drawings to put it on twos.

272
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:34,724
This is 16 drawings total.

273
00:16:35,264 --> 00:16:37,145
Putting it onto twos, every single in-between

274
00:16:37,165 --> 00:16:38,746
was basically just another mini breakdown.

275
00:16:40,387 --> 00:16:43,208
But then once it's on twos, taking it to ones,

276
00:16:43,808 --> 00:16:45,589
if there aren't a lot of exaggerated arcs,

277
00:16:46,729 --> 00:16:49,531
then I'll basically just turn my brain off.

278
00:16:50,813 --> 00:16:54,356
probably put on a podcast or something and just straight in or halfway in

279
00:16:54,396 --> 00:16:55,316
between between everything.

280
00:16:55,897 --> 00:16:58,959
I don't have to keep in mind exactly how everything's turning in space and

281
00:16:58,999 --> 00:16:59,499
things like that.

282
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:05,763
It's just if the lines here and then the lines there, the in between lines

283
00:17:05,783 --> 00:17:06,504
going to be right in the middle.

284
00:17:06,684 --> 00:17:08,285
That's usually what they did in the thirties anyways.

285
00:17:09,286 --> 00:17:13,188
We just definitely don't have time to be doing even more mini breakdowns to get

286
00:17:13,228 --> 00:17:14,349
it down to two ones.

287
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:17,891
And then here's the final animation.

288
00:17:19,142 --> 00:17:25,206
It's 32 drawings on 32 pieces of paper, which I would then scan them, I would send them

289
00:17:25,326 --> 00:17:30,890
off and then they would be inked by hand onto 32 more pieces of paper.

290
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,312
And that is why we're not done the game yet.

291
00:17:35,693 --> 00:17:37,594
Because we're ridiculous.

292
00:17:38,535 --> 00:17:40,816
But hey, it's coming out soon.

293
00:17:43,492 --> 00:17:47,793
Now I'll show you something from the Tombstone Boss, who is the final phase of the Slime

294
00:17:47,813 --> 00:17:48,193
Boss.

295
00:17:48,633 --> 00:17:53,835
He's a little slime, and then a big slime, and then the big slime is crushed by his own

296
00:17:53,895 --> 00:17:55,396
tombstone and you fight the tombstone.

297
00:17:55,696 --> 00:17:56,116
Makes sense.

298
00:17:57,457 --> 00:17:58,897
And I'll show you his slam attack.

299
00:18:00,338 --> 00:18:01,518
So this is what I got from Chad.

300
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,819
Just a quick thumbnail to show exactly what's going on.

301
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,941
And then I didn't have to do a whole lot of planning and thinking about this one.

302
00:18:08,961 --> 00:18:11,421
I mean, I'm working with just a slab of stone.

303
00:18:12,637 --> 00:18:15,002
This says, you make it go down, it goes WAP.

304
00:18:15,985 --> 00:18:17,428
You can't really read that in any other way.

305
00:18:17,448 --> 00:18:19,071
You don't need to do a lot of thumbnailing or anything.

306
00:18:19,953 --> 00:18:22,158
So I did just the main extremes.

307
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:27,819
At this point, they would test to see

308
00:18:28,499 --> 00:18:29,519
how it's going to work in the game,

309
00:18:29,579 --> 00:18:31,080
how it's going to visually be laid out,

310
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,020
how it's going to affect the gameplay,

311
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,361
how many frames I'm going to have

312
00:18:34,461 --> 00:18:39,042
to have him slam down to the final pose, which

313
00:18:39,082 --> 00:18:40,662
is where it would actually do damage to the player.

314
00:18:41,302 --> 00:18:42,803
So we figure out all that kind of stuff,

315
00:18:42,843 --> 00:18:44,523
and we lock it down in the rough stage.

316
00:18:45,944 --> 00:18:47,164
And then I go ahead with it.

317
00:18:48,224 --> 00:18:49,724
But this is the rough.

318
00:18:50,345 --> 00:18:52,525
I think it's just four drawings, maybe five.

319
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:55,317
Again, it's just to show exactly what's going on.

320
00:18:56,117 --> 00:18:59,759
I added a screen shake in TV Paint, which is the program

321
00:18:59,779 --> 00:19:01,440
that we use to shoot, or that I use to shoot.

322
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,800
I think a couple animators use something else.

323
00:19:03,501 --> 00:19:07,463
But yeah, just to help emphasize what's going to

324
00:19:07,483 --> 00:19:09,023
happen, because it's actually going to shake the screen in

325
00:19:09,063 --> 00:19:09,884
game, as you'll see later.

326
00:19:11,364 --> 00:19:13,625
So then I added all the details, locked it down, and

327
00:19:13,946 --> 00:19:14,386
here it is on 2's.

328
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:18,611
And then here it is on one.

329
00:19:18,771 --> 00:19:22,354
So an animation like this, none of the in-betweens

330
00:19:22,374 --> 00:19:23,215
would really be mindless.

331
00:19:23,655 --> 00:19:25,336
It doesn't really work when something

332
00:19:25,396 --> 00:19:26,337
is moving in this kind of way.

333
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,101
And here it is actually in the game.

334
00:19:32,582 --> 00:19:34,584
Just a quick little thing I want to talk about with the antic,

335
00:19:34,644 --> 00:19:37,266
how he leans back there before he slams down.

336
00:19:38,335 --> 00:19:44,198
I wanted to specifically make sure that he leaned back enough that I would get enough

337
00:19:44,258 --> 00:19:48,980
perspective change that you would see the dark color under the base of it, you would

338
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,223
get, you see the light rim line underneath the top of the thing and the light spot underneath

339
00:19:54,463 --> 00:19:55,903
where the slime protrudes.

340
00:19:56,684 --> 00:19:57,064
Because um...

341
00:19:59,504 --> 00:20:04,186
The point of an antic generally in something like this is to get the player's attention.

342
00:20:04,446 --> 00:20:07,727
You want them to know that they need to pay attention, they need to get the hell out of

343
00:20:07,747 --> 00:20:08,808
the way, or whatever it is.

344
00:20:08,848 --> 00:20:11,168
You just want to get the player's attention.

345
00:20:11,269 --> 00:20:16,190
So I mean I could have just had him squash down or stretch up a little bit for the antic,

346
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:22,393
but if I do it this way then I not only get change of shape, but I get change of color

347
00:20:22,433 --> 00:20:23,693
and change of perspective as well.

348
00:20:25,477 --> 00:20:28,879
Kind of just the more something changes, the more visual gravity it's going to have.

349
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:31,720
Because you want the player to notice as much as you can help.

350
00:20:34,061 --> 00:20:35,942
Okay, here's the cigar boss.

351
00:20:36,642 --> 00:20:39,403
And this is actually a world first reveal.

352
00:20:39,743 --> 00:20:40,844
Nobody has seen this guy yet.

353
00:20:42,445 --> 00:20:43,905
You're very, very lucky people.

354
00:20:46,726 --> 00:20:48,327
And I'll show you his death animation.

355
00:20:50,726 --> 00:20:53,249
So yeah, I just started out.

356
00:20:53,449 --> 00:20:55,651
I was given quite a bit of freedom with this one, which

357
00:20:55,691 --> 00:20:56,832
is really nice when that happens.

358
00:20:57,212 --> 00:20:59,214
So basically, I sort of just went

359
00:20:59,254 --> 00:21:02,817
through the same process I go through when

360
00:21:02,857 --> 00:21:03,518
designing something.

361
00:21:03,578 --> 00:21:06,321
So I look at all the other death animations in the game,

362
00:21:07,442 --> 00:21:09,984
all other death animations in other games, and so on,

363
00:21:10,024 --> 00:21:12,887
and just see what's been done, what would be interesting,

364
00:21:14,068 --> 00:21:16,130
what would get me excited, and so on like that.

365
00:21:17,868 --> 00:21:21,069
The first idea I had was the ashy part of his head lights up,

366
00:21:21,129 --> 00:21:23,210
and he sort of gets smoked from the top down,

367
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,410
and he's left as a pile of ashes.

368
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,831
But this worked better for a different animation.

369
00:21:26,851 --> 00:21:29,272
I thought maybe he could be leaned back, crying,

370
00:21:29,352 --> 00:21:31,773
ashes pouring out of his head, maybe hunched over forward,

371
00:21:31,813 --> 00:21:34,194
little bits falling off of his head,

372
00:21:35,534 --> 00:21:37,135
maybe burst into flames and scream,

373
00:21:37,395 --> 00:21:41,396
smoke away the pain of losing, cough up cigarettes.

374
00:21:43,149 --> 00:21:45,470
or split in half and pour ash all over the place,

375
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,211
but it's way too gnarly.

376
00:21:47,811 --> 00:21:49,753
And the game is rated E for everyone,

377
00:21:49,953 --> 00:21:52,214
so we're not doing that one.

378
00:21:52,955 --> 00:21:53,975
So this is the one that we went with.

379
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:00,223
It's definitely a Monty Python inspired idea.

380
00:22:00,943 --> 00:22:05,667
And we went with it because one, there's no other death animation in the game like it,

381
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:11,491
but also it gives kind of a cool sense of scale because you're tiny compared to this

382
00:22:11,571 --> 00:22:12,692
giant cigar that you're fighting.

383
00:22:13,553 --> 00:22:18,317
And then the cigar is tiny compared to whatever's crushing the cigar, so you feel extra small.

384
00:22:20,598 --> 00:22:22,960
So I was given just a rough...

385
00:22:24,297 --> 00:22:29,059
thumbnails to test it with the background, see how it would work on the background platform.

386
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:36,702
And then Joseph Coleman is the animator of the secret character that is stomping him.

387
00:22:38,183 --> 00:22:40,664
So he sent some leg designs and we picked the middle one.

388
00:22:41,805 --> 00:22:46,627
Then I did just rough outlines basically of the extremes of the thing.

389
00:22:46,747 --> 00:22:52,389
So that we know, because the cigar is on a platform and we need to know that it's going

390
00:22:52,409 --> 00:22:53,750
to match the background properly.

391
00:22:55,421 --> 00:22:56,622
And I did just the main keys.

392
00:23:00,404 --> 00:23:03,446
Oh, I did some reference and discovered a fetish

393
00:23:03,486 --> 00:23:07,749
of crushing things, like cigars, which was quite enlightening.

394
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:09,831
You're welcome.

395
00:23:09,871 --> 00:23:10,231
Look it up.

396
00:23:11,071 --> 00:23:11,852
It's very interesting.

397
00:23:11,992 --> 00:23:15,675
Anyways, so here's the rough animation.

398
00:23:19,945 --> 00:23:23,088
And with this one, I felt pretty confident in it.

399
00:23:23,188 --> 00:23:24,929
It seemed like there wasn't a whole lot of different ways

400
00:23:24,969 --> 00:23:25,469
that it could go.

401
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:28,492
So I didn't really bother putting it on twos

402
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,272
and then sending it off.

403
00:23:30,873 --> 00:23:31,814
I just went straight to ones.

404
00:23:31,934 --> 00:23:33,915
That's what I did, because I'm a rebel.

405
00:23:35,396 --> 00:23:37,318
And then so why do we do this to ourselves?

406
00:23:37,378 --> 00:23:38,639
Why do we animate it on paper?

407
00:23:38,659 --> 00:23:39,880
Why do we ink it on paper?

408
00:23:40,775 --> 00:23:43,276
Why do we do the backgrounds traditionally watercolors?

409
00:23:43,356 --> 00:23:44,356
Why the live jazz band?

410
00:23:44,976 --> 00:23:47,577
We just want to make it as authentic to the 30s as we can.

411
00:23:47,677 --> 00:23:49,958
Where we draw the line is we don't,

412
00:23:50,318 --> 00:23:51,418
or we color in Photoshop.

413
00:23:51,738 --> 00:23:54,979
We don't ink onto transparent cell

414
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,920
and paint on the back of the cell

415
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,801
because that would just be completely insane,

416
00:23:58,841 --> 00:23:59,821
just pure frustration.

417
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:02,662
And you wouldn't actually gain anything from doing that.

418
00:24:03,482 --> 00:24:04,863
But we think that you do gain something

419
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,403
from doing it on paper.

420
00:24:06,723 --> 00:24:08,404
I find that, like, for me anyways,

421
00:24:08,464 --> 00:24:09,644
my drawings are just plain better

422
00:24:09,684 --> 00:24:10,565
if I'm animating on paper.

423
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:13,240
And the

424
00:24:14,401 --> 00:24:16,302
Doing it with a live jazz band

425
00:24:16,342 --> 00:24:20,746
It sounds way better than if you tried to get it to just sound like it was done in the 30s

426
00:24:21,487 --> 00:24:24,590
with MIDI instruments, right and

427
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:30,655
I also think you got a quality of actually doing real watercolor backgrounds rather than I mean you can make a digital

428
00:24:30,995 --> 00:24:34,438
Watercoloring color looking background, but yeah, I do think you kind of lose something there

429
00:24:37,246 --> 00:24:40,308
And then yeah, we want to help keep paper animation alive

430
00:24:40,328 --> 00:24:43,971
because there aren't a whole lot of games or cartoons really these days that are made with it.

431
00:24:46,232 --> 00:24:49,795
And also it's just the most fun way to do it. Like it's what the team wants to do.

432
00:24:50,295 --> 00:24:54,879
It's we have a great time doing it this way. More fun than we would if we did it digitally and we think

433
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:57,221
that in this case it's worth it. And

434
00:24:58,482 --> 00:25:00,763
like we really want to do it. We really want to make a game

435
00:25:00,803 --> 00:25:05,907
that's like they would have done in the 30s rather than just try to make it look like we did it.

436
00:25:08,885 --> 00:25:09,206
Whoops.

437
00:25:10,227 --> 00:25:11,808
So why the 1930s style?

438
00:25:11,828 --> 00:25:13,650
Is this not playing?

439
00:25:15,632 --> 00:25:16,273
One second here.

440
00:25:18,095 --> 00:25:18,515
There we go.

441
00:25:18,695 --> 00:25:18,936
OK.

442
00:25:19,156 --> 00:25:22,519
So yeah, I mean, the 30s style just perfectly

443
00:25:22,639 --> 00:25:24,061
fits a side-scrolling game.

444
00:25:24,801 --> 00:25:26,503
A lot of the compositions in 30s cartoons,

445
00:25:26,523 --> 00:25:28,565
they actually look, a lot of the stuff

446
00:25:28,605 --> 00:25:30,027
takes place on a flat plane.

447
00:25:30,307 --> 00:25:30,968
And it seems like.

448
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,971
I mean, when I first saw the trailer for the game,

449
00:25:34,011 --> 00:25:35,692
I thought, why has nobody thought of this before?

450
00:25:35,932 --> 00:25:37,373
Like, it seems like such a perfect fit,

451
00:25:37,533 --> 00:25:38,734
but apparently they were the first

452
00:25:38,774 --> 00:25:39,554
to really go through with it.

453
00:25:41,575 --> 00:25:45,057
And they're just, those cartoons are just super creative,

454
00:25:45,097 --> 00:25:46,798
just one interesting idea after another.

455
00:25:46,818 --> 00:25:50,200
And a lot of that kind of thing

456
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,181
is not really in cartoons these days.

457
00:25:55,908 --> 00:26:01,851
And then, what I think is the most important reason to do 30s cartoons, or the biggest

458
00:26:01,911 --> 00:26:07,655
benefit of doing it in this style, is that we have complete freedom over the gameplay.

459
00:26:07,735 --> 00:26:10,736
The gameplay is not limited by the subject matter.

460
00:26:11,857 --> 00:26:12,478
What that means is...

461
00:26:14,067 --> 00:26:15,728
Like anything can happen in a 30s cartoon.

462
00:26:15,749 --> 00:26:17,990
You got the ghost man in the bottom middle,

463
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:20,452
he's pulling his head off, turning it into a bottle,

464
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:21,833
pouring a drink, pouring it in his neck,

465
00:26:22,354 --> 00:26:24,615
dancing lamps, all kinds of crazy stuff.

466
00:26:25,396 --> 00:26:30,240
So we can just say, like, I want a boss that,

467
00:26:32,001 --> 00:26:34,503
I want a boss that shoots something out of his,

468
00:26:34,663 --> 00:26:37,385
or shoots three things out of his stomach in a spread.

469
00:26:38,165 --> 00:26:40,706
And then those things explode.

470
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:43,767
And then three other things chase you around.

471
00:26:45,068 --> 00:26:47,129
And then once the gameplay's figured out,

472
00:26:47,249 --> 00:26:49,510
then we can fill in the subject matter after that.

473
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:53,111
So we could say it's a clown bear.

474
00:26:53,791 --> 00:26:55,512
And a mouth opens up in his belly.

475
00:26:56,212 --> 00:26:57,113
And bees fly out.

476
00:26:58,093 --> 00:26:59,094
And the bees explode.

477
00:26:59,114 --> 00:27:01,295
And then ghost bees chase you around.

478
00:27:02,212 --> 00:27:03,913
That could happen in a 30s cartoon.

479
00:27:04,153 --> 00:27:07,235
So we could do whatever we want for the game play.

480
00:27:07,295 --> 00:27:11,777
And if the game was, if it looked like King of the Hill

481
00:27:11,837 --> 00:27:13,478
and it was in a King of the Hill kind of world,

482
00:27:14,939 --> 00:27:16,580
you wouldn't be able to do this kind of thing.

483
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,241
You'd be much more limited in what you can do.

484
00:27:18,381 --> 00:27:19,982
You could make a sweet game, don't get me wrong,

485
00:27:20,042 --> 00:27:23,244
but you couldn't have Hank Hill have a mouth open up

486
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:24,305
and his belly and bees fly out.

487
00:27:24,365 --> 00:27:24,985
It just wouldn't fly.

488
00:27:28,816 --> 00:27:30,197
That's it, thanks everybody.

489
00:27:31,077 --> 00:27:32,998
Follow me at AdJClarkDude on Twitter.

490
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:36,459
I'll be posting a lot of animations,

491
00:27:36,479 --> 00:27:39,320
a lot of designs and concept arts as I can.

492
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:43,022
I can currently only show what's come out in trailers,

493
00:27:43,802 --> 00:27:45,863
what we've shown in gameplay videos and stuff like that.

494
00:27:46,483 --> 00:27:48,844
But once I'm able to, I'll be dumping basically

495
00:27:48,924 --> 00:27:50,185
everything that I like online.

496
00:27:50,405 --> 00:27:53,106
But yeah, that'll be pretty soon.

497
00:27:53,406 --> 00:27:54,846
It's coming out this year, we're getting real close.

498
00:27:56,019 --> 00:27:58,283
And we'll post about the release date when we know,

499
00:27:58,423 --> 00:28:00,427
once it's totally nailed down.

500
00:28:01,188 --> 00:28:03,151
We'll let everybody know on social media and all that.

501
00:28:04,734 --> 00:28:06,457
And that's it.

502
00:28:06,858 --> 00:28:09,002
Thank you very much, and enjoy the rest of the boot camp.
