1
00:00:05,218 --> 00:00:06,479
My name is Brian Intihar.

2
00:00:06,479 --> 00:00:08,681
I'm a creative director at Insomniac Games,

3
00:00:08,681 --> 00:00:10,683
and I am so happy to be here today.

4
00:00:10,683 --> 00:00:12,224
It's kind of fitting to be here with you

5
00:00:12,224 --> 00:00:14,966
because it was 11 years ago at GDC of 2008

6
00:00:14,966 --> 00:00:16,547
that I actually got the call

7
00:00:16,547 --> 00:00:19,109
that I had gotten the job at Insomniac.

8
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:22,892
I was literally having lunch two blocks down the road,

9
00:00:22,892 --> 00:00:25,134
second admission, when the call came in.

10
00:00:25,134 --> 00:00:29,237
Now making the move from journalism to game development

11
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:30,638
was extremely daunting,

12
00:00:30,638 --> 00:00:32,539
but it was hands down the best decision I've ever made

13
00:00:32,539 --> 00:00:33,540
in my professional career.

14
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:37,273
I've been in Insomniac for almost 11 years now,

15
00:00:37,273 --> 00:00:38,454
which is crazy.

16
00:00:38,454 --> 00:00:41,316
I started out in the community team,

17
00:00:41,316 --> 00:00:43,577
and I quickly transitioned into production,

18
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:46,198
and then for the last four and a half years,

19
00:00:46,198 --> 00:00:49,080
I've been a creative director at Insomniac.

20
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,321
Now, I can't tell you how thankful I am

21
00:00:50,321 --> 00:00:52,422
that Insomniac was the first job I had

22
00:00:52,422 --> 00:00:53,302
at the development studio.

23
00:00:53,302 --> 00:00:55,804
Before coming to Insomniac, as a journalist,

24
00:00:55,804 --> 00:00:57,125
I had done a bunch of stories on them,

25
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:58,766
and knew what a great place they had.

26
00:00:58,766 --> 00:01:00,947
You know, obviously, they won a bunch of awards,

27
00:01:00,947 --> 00:01:02,108
but I can tell you it's even better

28
00:01:02,108 --> 00:01:03,588
once you're inside those doors.

29
00:01:05,476 --> 00:01:06,938
Now before digging into the creative challenges

30
00:01:06,938 --> 00:01:08,541
that we faced on Marvel's Spider-Man,

31
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:11,125
I want to give you a bit of history on the project

32
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:12,968
and probably answer the question I get asked

33
00:01:12,968 --> 00:01:15,572
more than anything else.

34
00:01:15,572 --> 00:01:17,815
How in the hell did Insomniac start working

35
00:01:17,815 --> 00:01:18,536
on the Spider-Man game?

36
00:01:20,677 --> 00:01:21,798
So it was the fall of 2014.

37
00:01:21,798 --> 00:01:25,642
Insomniac was finishing up the title that we were working on.

38
00:01:25,642 --> 00:01:28,145
It was Sunset Overdrive for the Xbox One.

39
00:01:28,145 --> 00:01:30,467
I was the director of project management on it.

40
00:01:30,467 --> 00:01:34,511
And during the final days, some of our longtime Sony producers

41
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:37,855
were in the office visiting our president CEO, Ted Price.

42
00:01:37,855 --> 00:01:39,877
And during that conversation, they asked Ted,

43
00:01:39,877 --> 00:01:42,379
so what would you think about working in a Marvel game?

44
00:01:43,454 --> 00:01:46,276
So just coincidentally, I happened to be in Ted's office

45
00:01:46,276 --> 00:01:47,056
shortly thereafter.

46
00:01:47,056 --> 00:01:48,277
I think I was actually giving him an update

47
00:01:48,277 --> 00:01:50,558
if we were gonna make our goal date or not,

48
00:01:50,558 --> 00:01:52,179
based on how many bugs we had.

49
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:53,860
And he actually relayed the conversation.

50
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:57,363
Ted is a very open individual about the beings he has.

51
00:01:57,363 --> 00:01:58,503
And so I decided to say,

52
00:01:58,503 --> 00:02:00,264
I'm just gonna answer the question for him.

53
00:02:00,264 --> 00:02:01,645
Hell yes, we wanna make a Marvel game.

54
00:02:01,645 --> 00:02:05,007
And I actually, to this day, this is what I said to him.

55
00:02:05,007 --> 00:02:07,849
I go, I would give my right arm to work on a Marvel game.

56
00:02:07,849 --> 00:02:08,970
And that's kind of what I did.

57
00:02:11,092 --> 00:02:16,196
See, this is actually my arm that the character rigging team,

58
00:02:16,196 --> 00:02:19,419
they scanned for development of our muscle blend shapes

59
00:02:19,419 --> 00:02:20,240
on Peter.

60
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,742
So when Peter flexes his forearm in the game, that's me.

61
00:02:23,742 --> 00:02:27,265
So depending on how you look at it,

62
00:02:27,265 --> 00:02:30,128
I did give my arm to work in the game.

63
00:02:30,128 --> 00:02:31,949
Or you could say, I'm Spider-Man.

64
00:02:34,559 --> 00:02:36,861
Now, one of the great things about working in Insomniac

65
00:02:36,861 --> 00:02:38,522
and having a leader like Ted is that he never

66
00:02:38,522 --> 00:02:41,144
wants us to work on something we're not passionate about.

67
00:02:41,144 --> 00:02:43,545
So at the next company meeting, which was a few weeks later,

68
00:02:43,545 --> 00:02:45,587
Ted was giving us an update on what

69
00:02:45,587 --> 00:02:47,008
was going to be life after sunset like

70
00:02:47,008 --> 00:02:49,510
and what were some of our possible projects working on.

71
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,631
And I'll never forget what happened next.

72
00:02:51,631 --> 00:02:57,676
Ted simply put up that red brick Marvel logo, that iconic logo,

73
00:02:57,676 --> 00:02:59,857
and you could literally hear the whole room gasp.

74
00:03:00,651 --> 00:03:03,073
Even though Insomniac had never worked on a licensed IP

75
00:03:03,073 --> 00:03:05,516
in its then 20-year history, as some of you know,

76
00:03:05,516 --> 00:03:08,338
now we're celebrating 25 years this year,

77
00:03:08,338 --> 00:03:10,280
it was the right project at the right time.

78
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,903
For starters, we were extremely excited

79
00:03:12,903 --> 00:03:14,024
to be working with Sony again,

80
00:03:14,024 --> 00:03:16,666
and our longtime producers, Connie Booth,

81
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,048
Grady Hunt, and Mark Cerny,

82
00:03:18,048 --> 00:03:19,669
who had been instrumental in the success

83
00:03:19,669 --> 00:03:21,491
of both the Ratchet and Resistance franchises.

84
00:03:22,872 --> 00:03:25,653
We also hit it off right away with the new Marvel's games team,

85
00:03:25,653 --> 00:03:28,694
which was led by Jay Ong, who are a super passionate bunch

86
00:03:28,694 --> 00:03:30,835
and wanted our help in bringing a new era to the brand.

87
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:35,297
And lastly, Insomniac is full of diehard Marvel fans.

88
00:03:35,297 --> 00:03:38,578
We felt confident that we'd create something truly memorable,

89
00:03:38,578 --> 00:03:40,179
the Marvel game we always wanted.

90
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,025
Now, early on, we talked about this game

91
00:03:44,025 --> 00:03:46,346
being the biggest Marvel game they had ever made,

92
00:03:46,346 --> 00:03:50,528
the first of many memorable Marvel gaming experiences

93
00:03:50,528 --> 00:03:51,228
from this new group.

94
00:03:51,228 --> 00:03:53,249
Expectations were going to be high.

95
00:03:53,249 --> 00:03:54,990
That's exactly what we wanted to hear.

96
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:57,691
We weren't talking about just making the best Spider-Man game.

97
00:03:57,691 --> 00:03:59,232
We literally, from day one, were talking about,

98
00:03:59,232 --> 00:04:01,493
we want to be a game of the year contender.

99
00:04:01,493 --> 00:04:04,375
So we had the publisher support, the IP support,

100
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:05,815
and the internal support to move ahead.

101
00:04:07,487 --> 00:04:09,067
Now early on, we had those discussions

102
00:04:09,067 --> 00:04:11,328
about which Marvel characters we were passionate about.

103
00:04:11,328 --> 00:04:13,148
We talked about a variety of them.

104
00:04:13,148 --> 00:04:15,169
And no, I can't tell you which ones we were talking about.

105
00:04:15,169 --> 00:04:18,190
But even in that first conversation with Ted,

106
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,311
I said to him, we got to do Spider-Man.

107
00:04:20,311 --> 00:04:23,792
As Bill Roseman, who I'm going to mention a couple times

108
00:04:23,792 --> 00:04:25,852
in this presentation, he's the Marvel Games VP

109
00:04:25,852 --> 00:04:28,513
and creative director, told me, Spider-Man

110
00:04:28,513 --> 00:04:30,074
is the Mickey Mouse of Marvel.

111
00:04:30,074 --> 00:04:32,875
No Marvel character is as popular as Spider-Man.

112
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:35,495
No Marvel character has impacted as many fans

113
00:04:35,495 --> 00:04:36,936
as the friendly neighborhood wall crawler.

114
00:04:39,134 --> 00:04:42,196
More importantly, this character fit our studio so well.

115
00:04:42,196 --> 00:04:45,119
If you think about it, Spider-Man stories

116
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:46,700
feature so much heart and humor,

117
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,462
just like our Ratchet titles.

118
00:04:48,462 --> 00:04:52,365
More recently, Spider-Man puts a huge emphasis

119
00:04:52,365 --> 00:04:54,787
on traversal, gadgets, and fun, imaginative characters.

120
00:04:54,787 --> 00:04:56,949
So did Sunset Overdrive.

121
00:04:56,949 --> 00:04:59,171
I remember one review calling us out saying,

122
00:04:59,171 --> 00:05:01,413
man, it'd be great if they made a Spider-Man game.

123
00:05:01,413 --> 00:05:02,855
Well, the guy was right.

124
00:05:04,007 --> 00:05:06,229
And lastly, Spider-Man is an underdog,

125
00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:08,030
and being one of the last independent studios

126
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,971
still making AAA console titles,

127
00:05:09,971 --> 00:05:12,272
we consider ourselves an Insomniac underdog as well.

128
00:05:12,272 --> 00:05:15,094
So soon thereafter, we made it official,

129
00:05:15,094 --> 00:05:17,236
and told the team we were making a Spider-Man game.

130
00:05:17,236 --> 00:05:20,137
Now, in all my time at Insomniac,

131
00:05:20,137 --> 00:05:22,259
I've never been as excited to work on a project.

132
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:23,760
While Ratchet and Resistance

133
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,181
were the reason I came to Insomniac,

134
00:05:25,181 --> 00:05:27,322
I had a very personal connection with Spidey,

135
00:05:27,322 --> 00:05:28,463
and I'm sure some of you did as well.

136
00:05:30,147 --> 00:05:32,647
See, I was the kid who grew up in front of the,

137
00:05:32,647 --> 00:05:34,747
watching TV in my Spider-Man underoos,

138
00:05:34,747 --> 00:05:36,248
yes, I actually had them,

139
00:05:36,248 --> 00:05:37,348
and watching Spider-Man cartoons.

140
00:05:37,348 --> 00:05:39,448
I was the kid, when my mom was trying

141
00:05:39,448 --> 00:05:40,468
to get some shopping done,

142
00:05:40,468 --> 00:05:41,809
the only way she could do it was

143
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:43,229
to give me my Spider-Man action figure,

144
00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:45,589
that actual action figure that could tell you how old I am,

145
00:05:45,589 --> 00:05:48,650
and I would actually pretend to swing him

146
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:50,290
from clothes rack to clothes rack

147
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,231
while she was getting some shopping done.

148
00:05:52,231 --> 00:05:54,131
And then later, I would think about it at night,

149
00:05:54,131 --> 00:05:55,631
like, could you really use a web line

150
00:05:55,631 --> 00:05:56,632
and swing through New York City?

151
00:05:58,392 --> 00:06:00,258
As I got older, I started reading the comics,

152
00:06:00,258 --> 00:06:01,983
and to this day, I still anxiously await

153
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,287
every new Spider-Man film.

154
00:06:05,572 --> 00:06:08,734
So not only was our studio bringing my favorite Marvel

155
00:06:08,734 --> 00:06:10,575
character, who just happens to be one of the most iconic

156
00:06:10,575 --> 00:06:12,857
characters in all of pop culture, to the PlayStation 4,

157
00:06:12,857 --> 00:06:15,439
we were also aiming to deliver at a quality bar

158
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:17,040
of all the other Sony first title titles.

159
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,402
And as you know from their pedigree,

160
00:06:19,402 --> 00:06:21,263
that quality bar is amazingly high.

161
00:06:21,263 --> 00:06:24,226
And one more thing, I was gonna be the creative director,

162
00:06:24,226 --> 00:06:25,947
a first time creative director.

163
00:06:25,947 --> 00:06:27,868
I think our Peter Parker said it the best

164
00:06:27,868 --> 00:06:28,769
in our first trailer for the game.

165
00:06:28,769 --> 00:06:29,610
No pressure, right?

166
00:06:35,841 --> 00:06:40,145
Now the good news is that four years later, Marvel's Spider-Man proved to be an extremely

167
00:06:40,145 --> 00:06:43,889
successful game for all parties, for Insomniac, Sony, and Marvel.

168
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:48,994
It's already the best-selling Insomniac title in the 25-year history.

169
00:06:48,994 --> 00:06:52,697
It's the fastest-selling PlayStation title of all time, selling 3.3 million copies in

170
00:06:52,697 --> 00:06:54,659
three days, these first three days.

171
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,101
And I'm really proud it garnered the critical success

172
00:06:57,101 --> 00:06:57,722
we were looking for.

173
00:06:57,722 --> 00:06:58,542
We're an 87 Metacritic.

174
00:06:58,542 --> 00:07:02,205
And when I made this slide, 140 nominations and 90 year

175
00:07:02,205 --> 00:07:02,545
in awards.

176
00:07:02,545 --> 00:07:06,528
And while that's all that great, the sales numbers,

177
00:07:06,528 --> 00:07:08,650
the critical success is great, there's

178
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:10,551
nothing more gratifying than seeing the impact it's

179
00:07:10,551 --> 00:07:11,052
had on our fans.

180
00:07:11,052 --> 00:07:14,654
For example, we were stunned and overwhelmed

181
00:07:14,654 --> 00:07:17,656
and didn't ever expect the fantastic images that

182
00:07:17,656 --> 00:07:19,418
would come out of players using photo mode.

183
00:07:21,256 --> 00:07:23,436
We were both amazed and somewhat shocked

184
00:07:23,436 --> 00:07:24,817
by the cosplay the game inspired.

185
00:07:24,817 --> 00:07:26,177
Thank you, shirtless Spider-Man.

186
00:07:26,177 --> 00:07:28,698
But this was the best.

187
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,778
We found that one of our fans, after playing the game,

188
00:07:31,778 --> 00:07:34,119
started volunteering at his aunt's homeless shelter,

189
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:35,819
just like Pete does for his Aunt May.

190
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:39,620
When your game encourages players to be better people,

191
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,161
that's truly special.

192
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:43,361
Now here's another spoiler for you.

193
00:07:44,418 --> 00:07:47,559
Making this game was hands down the most difficult, intense,

194
00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:48,979
and emotional experience I've ever been through

195
00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:49,900
in my professional career.

196
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,821
Even though the game being a huge success,

197
00:07:52,821 --> 00:07:54,521
we faced our fair share of creative challenges

198
00:07:54,521 --> 00:07:55,622
along the way.

199
00:07:55,622 --> 00:07:58,683
So today what I wanna do is discuss those challenges

200
00:07:58,683 --> 00:08:01,363
across three separate journeys.

201
00:08:01,363 --> 00:08:03,524
First, we're gonna dig into the character journey,

202
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:05,645
which we'll look at the creative challenges

203
00:08:05,645 --> 00:08:07,485
that we face working with such an iconic character

204
00:08:07,485 --> 00:08:08,966
that's been around for more than half a century.

205
00:08:10,152 --> 00:08:11,653
Next up, we'll talk about the game journey,

206
00:08:11,653 --> 00:08:14,435
which will detail the creative challenges

207
00:08:14,435 --> 00:08:16,036
we face specifically with the narrative.

208
00:08:16,036 --> 00:08:17,497
And last, I'll discuss my journey,

209
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,939
which will dig into the creative challenges

210
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:22,540
of being a first-time creative director.

211
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,102
What I hope you walk away from today's talk with

212
00:08:25,102 --> 00:08:27,883
is through our experiences on Spider-Man,

213
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:30,745
you'd understand the challenges we faced,

214
00:08:30,745 --> 00:08:33,027
how, why, and we initially failed, and we failed a lot.

215
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,091
and the skills and approaches we use

216
00:08:36,091 --> 00:08:37,391
to eventually conquer them.

217
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:39,412
Ultimately, I hope you can walk away from today

218
00:08:39,412 --> 00:08:41,233
with a better understanding of how you can apply

219
00:08:41,233 --> 00:08:42,814
those lessons to your own game,

220
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:45,054
whether it's a licensed IP like Spider-Man,

221
00:08:45,054 --> 00:08:47,635
a new IP, or a follow-up to an existing IP.

222
00:08:47,635 --> 00:08:51,497
So let's kick things off with the character journey.

223
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:55,558
As many of you know, the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man

224
00:08:55,558 --> 00:08:57,279
has been around for a very long time

225
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,740
and across so many different mediums.

226
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,480
There's been 55 years of comics,

227
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,382
so you can imagine the challenges we had on the story side.

228
00:09:04,712 --> 00:09:06,394
six standalone live-action movies,

229
00:09:06,394 --> 00:09:07,716
and another one underway in July,

230
00:09:07,716 --> 00:09:08,457
nine animated TV series,

231
00:09:08,457 --> 00:09:10,159
and just since 2000, 12 console games.

232
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:13,363
So with a character that's been done so many times

233
00:09:13,363 --> 00:09:15,906
across so many different mediums,

234
00:09:15,906 --> 00:09:17,968
the challenge we had in front of us

235
00:09:17,968 --> 00:09:20,191
was finding that right balance

236
00:09:20,191 --> 00:09:22,734
of giving players something new,

237
00:09:22,734 --> 00:09:24,156
but also not angering them.

238
00:09:25,887 --> 00:09:27,788
And like I said, it didn't take long to fail there.

239
00:09:27,788 --> 00:09:30,010
I, as the creative director, assumed everyone

240
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:32,891
and was introduced to Spider-Man just like me.

241
00:09:32,891 --> 00:09:34,732
They went through these phases.

242
00:09:34,732 --> 00:09:36,133
You start out in front of the TV

243
00:09:36,133 --> 00:09:37,554
in your underoos watching cartoons.

244
00:09:37,554 --> 00:09:39,975
You move on to the comics when you start reading.

245
00:09:39,975 --> 00:09:41,396
And eventually, you may hit the movies.

246
00:09:41,396 --> 00:09:43,577
I mean, in my opinion,

247
00:09:43,577 --> 00:09:44,758
this is the best superhero of all time.

248
00:09:44,758 --> 00:09:47,339
And of course, everybody loves superheroes, right?

249
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:49,440
This is just the way it's supposed to be.

250
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,401
But I quickly learned I was being completely naive.

251
00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:54,770
What I learned is that some, as a kid,

252
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:58,373
started watching the cartoons and simply stopped right there.

253
00:09:58,373 --> 00:10:00,334
Others got into the comics and eventually gave them up.

254
00:10:00,334 --> 00:10:03,656
But I think what was the biggest surprise to me

255
00:10:03,656 --> 00:10:05,837
was learning that some people's knowledge of the character

256
00:10:05,837 --> 00:10:08,199
began and ended with that first Spider-Man movie trilogy

257
00:10:08,199 --> 00:10:08,719
by Sam Raimi.

258
00:10:08,719 --> 00:10:11,501
And this wasn't just true for the people

259
00:10:11,501 --> 00:10:12,521
outside of our building.

260
00:10:12,521 --> 00:10:14,923
It was actually true for Insomniacs as well.

261
00:10:14,923 --> 00:10:16,083
And early in development,

262
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,165
this led to disagreements amongst the team

263
00:10:18,165 --> 00:10:20,206
and some folks not buying into the game I wanted to make.

264
00:10:22,398 --> 00:10:24,499
And what I began to realize is that what people wanted

265
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:26,260
was a Spider-Man that they had in their own head,

266
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:29,642
the version that they had built up over the years.

267
00:10:29,642 --> 00:10:30,902
And you better not mess with that.

268
00:10:30,902 --> 00:10:34,104
And as Twitter shows, if you mess with it the wrong way,

269
00:10:34,104 --> 00:10:36,625
they're gonna let you know about it.

270
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:37,045
So what did we do?

271
00:10:37,045 --> 00:10:40,947
We simply dug into and defined the DNA of the character.

272
00:10:40,947 --> 00:10:43,368
We asked ourselves, what were the common characteristics

273
00:10:43,368 --> 00:10:46,790
of Spider-Man, regardless of the medium people consumed?

274
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,591
And like I said, we spent a lot of time with Bill Roseman,

275
00:10:49,591 --> 00:10:51,352
Marvel Games' VP and creative director.

276
00:10:52,197 --> 00:10:55,700
talked about the character and if you talk to Bill,

277
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,261
he knows Spider-Man better than anyone,

278
00:10:57,261 --> 00:11:00,144
and I would say he probably knows Marvel better than anyone.

279
00:11:00,144 --> 00:11:02,306
And for our first exercise was this group activity

280
00:11:02,306 --> 00:11:04,528
where we literally broke down the duality of the character.

281
00:11:05,896 --> 00:11:07,637
What you see here is the result of that exercise.

282
00:11:07,637 --> 00:11:10,658
On the Spider-Man side, he's known for that iconic costume,

283
00:11:10,658 --> 00:11:13,139
which Bill says is the best costume of all time,

284
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:15,580
his spider powers, his ability for web swinging

285
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,601
and crafting gadgets, and of course, his sense of humor.

286
00:11:17,601 --> 00:11:19,362
Now on the flip side, you have Peter,

287
00:11:19,362 --> 00:11:21,182
who's just as important.

288
00:11:21,182 --> 00:11:23,804
This constant battle of power and responsibility,

289
00:11:23,804 --> 00:11:26,045
his love of science, his relationships,

290
00:11:26,045 --> 00:11:28,145
and especially early on, this kind of idea

291
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:30,546
of like he's somewhat of a loser who becomes a superhero.

292
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:34,118
Now, funny story about this exercise.

293
00:11:34,118 --> 00:11:37,680
So if you've ever met Bill or seen him do an interview,

294
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,381
he's really passionate, and he gets amped up.

295
00:11:40,381 --> 00:11:41,682
And he was so excited about this topic,

296
00:11:41,682 --> 00:11:43,503
he literally started drawing this

297
00:11:43,503 --> 00:11:44,503
in one of our conference rooms.

298
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:47,585
But what Bill didn't realize was that wasn't a whiteboard.

299
00:11:47,585 --> 00:11:50,266
He was literally writing on the wall.

300
00:11:50,266 --> 00:11:52,167
So he, and the thing is, he was so amped up,

301
00:11:52,167 --> 00:11:54,808
we didn't have the heart to tell him it wasn't a whiteboard.

302
00:11:54,808 --> 00:11:57,029
And so we actually just ended up painting over it,

303
00:11:57,029 --> 00:11:59,050
and that's Bill, and that's why we love him.

304
00:12:01,205 --> 00:12:03,608
From there, we further solidified the DNA of the character

305
00:12:03,608 --> 00:12:05,290
to help ourselves fully understand

306
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,954
and how to portray them in the game.

307
00:12:07,954 --> 00:12:09,916
When it comes to Peter, he's very relatable,

308
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:12,079
vulnerable, and somewhat awkward in that cute way.

309
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,383
When it comes to Spider-Man, he's confident, resilient,

310
00:12:15,383 --> 00:12:17,186
and uses his humor to deal with stress.

311
00:12:18,218 --> 00:12:19,859
But it wasn't until something I remembered

312
00:12:19,859 --> 00:12:21,501
in my very first conversation with Bill

313
00:12:21,501 --> 00:12:23,983
that things really fell into place.

314
00:12:23,983 --> 00:12:25,965
So my first conversation with Bill was on the phone.

315
00:12:25,965 --> 00:12:27,025
It was roughly an hour.

316
00:12:27,025 --> 00:12:29,127
I swear to you, I took about 10 to 11 pages of notes.

317
00:12:29,127 --> 00:12:32,070
And he provided such great insight on the character

318
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:34,432
and why to this day Spider-Man remains so special.

319
00:12:34,432 --> 00:12:37,575
And during that call, he'll say something I'll never forget.

320
00:12:37,575 --> 00:12:39,556
Something that literally would provide

321
00:12:39,556 --> 00:12:42,078
the creative foundation for everything we did in the game.

322
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:44,140
And I remember actually circling this in my notebook.

323
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:49,380
The best stories are when Peter's world and Spider-Man's world collide.

324
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:52,281
Look at any of those mediums that I talked about.

325
00:12:52,281 --> 00:12:53,861
That statement holds true.

326
00:12:53,861 --> 00:12:58,182
If you only deliver the superhero fantasy,

327
00:12:58,182 --> 00:13:00,123
you aren't doing the character justice.

328
00:13:00,123 --> 00:13:03,164
Peter, the human story, is just as important.

329
00:13:03,164 --> 00:13:07,705
And his relationships across both parts of his life make for the best drama.

330
00:13:08,745 --> 00:13:10,985
This probably holds true for Spider-Man and Peter

331
00:13:10,985 --> 00:13:13,806
more than any other superhero because he's so relatable.

332
00:13:13,806 --> 00:13:15,626
He's not a billionaire like Tony Stark.

333
00:13:15,626 --> 00:13:16,986
He's not a god like Thor.

334
00:13:16,986 --> 00:13:19,787
We all kind of can see ourselves as being Peter.

335
00:13:19,787 --> 00:13:23,467
And this clarity really helped the team get on the same page.

336
00:13:23,467 --> 00:13:25,248
It also helped us be much more confident

337
00:13:25,248 --> 00:13:27,388
in the creative risks we wanted to take with the franchise.

338
00:13:27,388 --> 00:13:30,669
And what I want to do today is share with you

339
00:13:30,669 --> 00:13:33,689
three examples of how this helped us define Spider-Man

340
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:34,569
with an insomniac twist.

341
00:13:34,569 --> 00:13:36,450
So let's start with Peter's age.

342
00:13:38,354 --> 00:13:40,036
Now, when most people think of Peter Parker,

343
00:13:40,036 --> 00:13:43,058
they think of him as the 15-year-old high school student.

344
00:13:43,058 --> 00:13:44,560
But not in this game.

345
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,761
We actually made him a little bit older.

346
00:13:46,761 --> 00:13:48,663
First of all, we knew the high school version

347
00:13:48,663 --> 00:13:50,405
had been done a lot, and coincidentally,

348
00:13:50,405 --> 00:13:53,227
we found out later, when Marvel got their hands back

349
00:13:53,227 --> 00:13:54,989
on Spider-Man, they were gonna do a younger Spider-Man,

350
00:13:54,989 --> 00:13:56,890
so it's good we could distance ourselves.

351
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:58,992
And we knew right away from reviewing, doing reviews,

352
00:13:58,992 --> 00:14:02,135
people were tired of origin stories.

353
00:14:02,135 --> 00:14:04,056
So we decided to make him 23 years old,

354
00:14:04,056 --> 00:14:05,518
which we felt was a great sweet spot.

355
00:14:07,143 --> 00:14:09,945
First off, it allowed us to explore a time in Peter's life

356
00:14:09,945 --> 00:14:13,008
that wasn't as familiar to people.

357
00:14:13,008 --> 00:14:15,450
Personally, this was a very impactful time in my life.

358
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:17,312
Around the same time I had just graduated college,

359
00:14:17,312 --> 00:14:19,394
I was living on my own for the first time,

360
00:14:19,394 --> 00:14:20,675
paying my own bills,

361
00:14:20,675 --> 00:14:22,496
trying to start a career as a journalist,

362
00:14:22,496 --> 00:14:23,878
and I felt like others who played the game

363
00:14:23,878 --> 00:14:25,859
could really relate to that.

364
00:14:25,859 --> 00:14:28,902
It also let us touch upon mature themes

365
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:30,383
like mentorship and partnership

366
00:14:30,383 --> 00:14:32,986
that helped make the story much more emotional

367
00:14:32,986 --> 00:14:34,487
while also raising the stakes of the world.

368
00:14:36,182 --> 00:14:38,884
And lastly, he wasn't so old, like married with kids,

369
00:14:38,884 --> 00:14:40,366
that fans couldn't identify with him.

370
00:14:40,366 --> 00:14:41,247
Next is Peter's job.

371
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:43,349
Again, if you ask a lot of people,

372
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:46,672
they probably think of Peter as just that photographer

373
00:14:46,672 --> 00:14:49,474
of the Daily Beagle, continually getting yelled at

374
00:14:49,474 --> 00:14:51,637
by his boss, J. Jonah Jameson.

375
00:14:51,637 --> 00:14:55,180
However, we decided to go the scientist route.

376
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:58,503
For starters, it was a much more modern take on the character.

377
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,954
It plays much more to the character's strengths.

378
00:15:01,954 --> 00:15:03,859
Remember, as I mentioned in that chart,

379
00:15:03,859 --> 00:15:05,885
Peter's a really smart guy, and he loves science.

380
00:15:06,908 --> 00:15:10,029
But more importantly, it tied very heavily into our goals

381
00:15:10,029 --> 00:15:11,330
of delivering a very human story

382
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:13,130
within the world's colliding concept.

383
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:16,352
In the game, Peter works for his mentor, Dr. Otto Octavius,

384
00:15:16,352 --> 00:15:18,853
who he inadvertently helps make

385
00:15:18,853 --> 00:15:20,494
into the city's newest supervillain

386
00:15:20,494 --> 00:15:21,574
and his toughest threat ever.

387
00:15:21,574 --> 00:15:24,876
Those mechanical arms, that's because of Pete.

388
00:15:24,876 --> 00:15:27,177
And what's great about this, what really was nice

389
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:28,977
was that because we dug into the DNA,

390
00:15:28,977 --> 00:15:30,438
we understood the character,

391
00:15:30,438 --> 00:15:32,439
this was a storyline that was completely unique.

392
00:15:32,439 --> 00:15:34,240
You cannot find Peter working for Otto

393
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,880
in any of the comics, any of the movies.

394
00:15:38,315 --> 00:15:41,116
Last up is the game's supporting cast.

395
00:15:41,116 --> 00:15:44,057
While many of Peter's core relationships stayed the same,

396
00:15:44,057 --> 00:15:46,498
we wanted to put some of them in new, unfamiliar roles

397
00:15:46,498 --> 00:15:48,319
to help support this coming-of-age story,

398
00:15:48,319 --> 00:15:50,759
Peter's journey in becoming a young adult.

399
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:55,381
Mary Jane Watson, she's mainly known as the model,

400
00:15:55,381 --> 00:15:57,282
the actress, the club owner, but in our universe,

401
00:15:57,282 --> 00:15:58,782
she's actually a reporter for the Daily Bugle.

402
00:16:00,931 --> 00:16:03,794
Norman Osborn, he's typically known as the head of Oscorp

403
00:16:03,794 --> 00:16:06,457
and also another famous Spider-Man role.

404
00:16:06,457 --> 00:16:08,139
But since Oscorp, he's moved on

405
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:09,180
to be the mayor of New York City.

406
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,134
And this time around, Ah-May isn't sitting in Queens

407
00:16:13,134 --> 00:16:15,436
waiting for Pete to come home and make him wheat cakes.

408
00:16:15,436 --> 00:16:16,576
She's actually in the city

409
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:18,798
helping run the Feast homeless shelters.

410
00:16:18,798 --> 00:16:20,239
And again, this is a great example

411
00:16:20,239 --> 00:16:21,920
of how we could deliver the world's colliding concept

412
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,442
because the Feast shelter is owned by Martin Li.

413
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:27,143
Martin Li happens to be Mr. Negative.

414
00:16:27,143 --> 00:16:28,164
If you've played the game,

415
00:16:28,164 --> 00:16:29,925
he's one of the biggest threats in the city.

416
00:16:29,925 --> 00:16:33,488
So you have Peter, Martin Li, Spider-Man,

417
00:16:33,488 --> 00:16:35,409
Mr. Negative, again, world's colliding.

418
00:16:37,654 --> 00:16:38,836
And last, we have Miles Morales.

419
00:16:38,836 --> 00:16:40,078
Now, the last time we saw Miles,

420
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:42,783
I think he was winning an Oscar for Into the Spider-Verse.

421
00:16:44,229 --> 00:16:47,431
But before that, before we knew that Miles was going to blow up

422
00:16:47,431 --> 00:16:49,352
like that, comic book fans really

423
00:16:49,352 --> 00:16:51,874
knew him as that Spider-Man from another universe.

424
00:16:51,874 --> 00:16:53,715
And what we thought was our game was, again,

425
00:16:53,715 --> 00:16:56,236
how can we make our universe feel unique?

426
00:16:56,236 --> 00:16:58,098
What happens if Peter and Miles actually

427
00:16:58,098 --> 00:16:59,558
lived in the same city?

428
00:16:59,558 --> 00:17:01,280
What if Miles was the 15-year-old?

429
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,361
What if he was the Spider-Man fan,

430
00:17:03,361 --> 00:17:05,222
and he actually didn't have Spider-Man powers

431
00:17:05,222 --> 00:17:06,062
in the very beginning?

432
00:17:06,062 --> 00:17:08,444
And if you played the game, you know what happens at the end.

433
00:17:10,675 --> 00:17:12,276
So what are the takeaways here?

434
00:17:12,276 --> 00:17:14,337
Whether you're building a new character from scratch,

435
00:17:14,337 --> 00:17:16,638
working with a well-established one like Spider-Man,

436
00:17:16,638 --> 00:17:18,819
it's good to remember the following.

437
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:22,681
Define your character's DNA as soon as possible.

438
00:17:22,681 --> 00:17:24,582
Not only will this help create a solid,

439
00:17:24,582 --> 00:17:26,222
creative foundation early on,

440
00:17:26,222 --> 00:17:27,583
but it'll provide clarity for your team

441
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,484
and increase buy-in for your creative vision.

442
00:17:31,327 --> 00:17:33,148
It's also going to help your entire team,

443
00:17:33,148 --> 00:17:34,709
and even yourself as creative director,

444
00:17:34,709 --> 00:17:36,290
when it comes to time to make decisions

445
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:37,511
throughout development.

446
00:17:37,511 --> 00:17:39,812
This includes setting priorities.

447
00:17:39,812 --> 00:17:41,894
For example, does this particular mission,

448
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,195
feature, mechanic, help support

449
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:44,175
the pillars of your character?

450
00:17:44,175 --> 00:17:46,657
It'll also help you in determining game features,

451
00:17:46,657 --> 00:17:48,238
especially when it comes times

452
00:17:48,238 --> 00:17:49,979
to choose which ones to elevate,

453
00:17:49,979 --> 00:17:51,980
as it'll all have to do, which ones to cut.

454
00:17:52,754 --> 00:17:55,518
And also, I promise, this is going to make your team much more autonomous.

455
00:17:55,518 --> 00:18:00,504
They won't be coming to you, consulting the creative director or even your writer about

456
00:18:00,504 --> 00:18:03,848
every single choice they're going to make because they're going to know the character

457
00:18:03,848 --> 00:18:04,408
as well as you do.

458
00:18:04,408 --> 00:18:08,613
And solidifying the DNA of your character will also act as your compass for how big

459
00:18:08,613 --> 00:18:09,615
of risks you can take.

460
00:18:11,118 --> 00:18:12,919
You'll know how to answer questions like,

461
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:14,220
how much can you change this character

462
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,661
from what someone already knows?

463
00:18:16,661 --> 00:18:19,963
Can you put this character in this particular scenario?

464
00:18:19,963 --> 00:18:21,644
And when they're in this scenario,

465
00:18:21,644 --> 00:18:23,205
how will the character act?

466
00:18:23,205 --> 00:18:24,866
What decision will they make?

467
00:18:24,866 --> 00:18:26,067
As I've detailed today,

468
00:18:26,067 --> 00:18:28,728
and especially if you know what we did with one character

469
00:18:28,728 --> 00:18:29,869
at the end of Spider-Man,

470
00:18:29,869 --> 00:18:32,970
you know we had to answer those questions.

471
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,611
And remember, at the end of the day,

472
00:18:34,611 --> 00:18:35,912
you're never gonna please everyone,

473
00:18:35,912 --> 00:18:37,233
and that's totally okay.

474
00:18:38,939 --> 00:18:41,080
For example, throughout development,

475
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,261
I had a number of people on Twitter message me

476
00:18:43,261 --> 00:18:45,901
saying that we ruined MJ by not making her an actress

477
00:18:45,901 --> 00:18:47,602
or model or club owner.

478
00:18:47,602 --> 00:18:49,203
And I can tell you, this can be really hard to hear

479
00:18:49,203 --> 00:18:51,803
because when you're as passionate about the franchise

480
00:18:51,803 --> 00:18:53,604
as the person on the other side of the tweet

481
00:18:53,604 --> 00:18:56,245
criticizing you, it can hurt.

482
00:18:56,245 --> 00:18:59,686
But again, at the same time, I felt very confident

483
00:18:59,686 --> 00:19:00,807
that based on the homework we did,

484
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,427
the core of the character was still in place

485
00:19:02,427 --> 00:19:04,468
and the change of her profession was the right move

486
00:19:04,468 --> 00:19:05,828
for the story we wanted to tell.

487
00:19:06,863 --> 00:19:09,106
Of course, it didn't hurt that many people also messaged me saying,

488
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,307
hey, they really loved what we did with MJ.

489
00:19:10,307 --> 00:19:13,251
But I think it's really important to remember that everything you do,

490
00:19:13,251 --> 00:19:16,916
especially with a character so well-known or a well-established franchise,

491
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:18,458
there's just no way to please everyone.

492
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:27,928
Now, it's one thing to understand the DNA of the character,

493
00:19:27,928 --> 00:19:30,069
but it's another thing to actually take that knowledge

494
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:31,790
and put it into the game.

495
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,011
When it comes to the game journey,

496
00:19:33,011 --> 00:19:34,852
the second journey I'm gonna talk about today,

497
00:19:34,852 --> 00:19:36,913
it's fair to say that every single department

498
00:19:36,913 --> 00:19:40,194
on this project faced that struggle at times.

499
00:19:40,194 --> 00:19:41,495
From programming animation,

500
00:19:41,495 --> 00:19:43,616
we knew getting traversal feel right

501
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:45,237
was one of the most important things,

502
00:19:45,237 --> 00:19:47,198
if not the most important element

503
00:19:47,198 --> 00:19:48,419
of any Spider-Man experience.

504
00:19:50,192 --> 00:19:53,657
On the design side, we really want to push this idea when it came to combat, that Spider-Man

505
00:19:53,657 --> 00:19:58,304
was more of this acrobatic improviser, not just another muscle-browned brawler.

506
00:20:00,108 --> 00:20:02,789
And when it came to the UI, with Peter's natural tendencies

507
00:20:02,789 --> 00:20:05,831
to create his own tech, we in Marvel art director Tim Tsang

508
00:20:05,831 --> 00:20:07,912
wanted this idea of more of that homebrew feel

509
00:20:07,912 --> 00:20:08,833
to come through in the UI.

510
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:12,335
And the good news is there's several talks at GDC this year

511
00:20:12,335 --> 00:20:14,256
that cover a lot of these areas and many more.

512
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:15,516
I really recommend checking them out.

513
00:20:15,516 --> 00:20:17,858
But what I want to do today, specifically,

514
00:20:17,858 --> 00:20:19,278
is talk about the challenges we faced

515
00:20:19,278 --> 00:20:20,359
on the narrative side of things.

516
00:20:22,743 --> 00:20:26,888
Now the first challenge was big because we knew it tied so much to the character's DNA.

517
00:20:26,888 --> 00:20:30,632
How do you balance Spider-Man's sense of humor with wanting a very emotional story with high

518
00:20:30,632 --> 00:20:31,773
stakes?

519
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:35,116
As any Spider-Man fan will tell you, a big part of what they love about this character

520
00:20:35,116 --> 00:20:36,037
is his sense of humor.

521
00:20:36,037 --> 00:20:41,183
But as all, we're all creative people, especially writers, they know humor is extremely difficult.

522
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:44,274
Another complication was the medium.

523
00:20:44,274 --> 00:20:47,815
This was not a 30-minute TV show or a two-hour film.

524
00:20:47,815 --> 00:20:52,257
Just to complete, this was an open-world Spider-Man game,

525
00:20:52,257 --> 00:20:54,837
and just to complete the main story, it took 20 hours.

526
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:56,758
That's a lot of jokes.

527
00:20:56,758 --> 00:20:58,458
Now, so we not only did we need to find our tone,

528
00:20:58,458 --> 00:20:59,579
but also our cadence.

529
00:20:59,579 --> 00:21:02,159
And obviously, Spider-Man is not unique in this regard.

530
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,260
Every game needs to do this.

531
00:21:05,049 --> 00:21:07,831
When it came to VO, early milestones had him quipping

532
00:21:07,831 --> 00:21:09,892
before and during, after every fight.

533
00:21:09,892 --> 00:21:12,073
I figured, hey, this is what Spider-Man does.

534
00:21:12,073 --> 00:21:13,614
This is what people are gonna expect.

535
00:21:13,614 --> 00:21:14,975
We need to do this.

536
00:21:14,975 --> 00:21:17,477
But it became painfully obvious that there was no way

537
00:21:17,477 --> 00:21:19,018
we could write enough VO lines

538
00:21:19,018 --> 00:21:20,839
where it didn't end up feeling repetitive.

539
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:23,140
And the frequency led to even the good VO lines

540
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,981
just to become annoying over time.

541
00:21:24,981 --> 00:21:29,084
Now here's a footage from a very early milestone

542
00:21:29,084 --> 00:21:30,685
that shows a quip-happy Spider-Man.

543
00:21:40,158 --> 00:21:47,024
Bad guy, corner pocket.

544
00:21:47,024 --> 00:21:48,605
Butterfingers.

545
00:21:48,605 --> 00:21:51,387
Down already.

546
00:21:51,387 --> 00:21:55,310
Who's been putting protein in his own meal?

547
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:57,592
So I can tell you right now that bad guy corner pocket line,

548
00:21:57,592 --> 00:22:00,074
that played pretty much every single time he threw something in the game

549
00:22:00,074 --> 00:22:01,616
and it's like kind of burned into my brain.

550
00:22:01,616 --> 00:22:07,200
Now in the cinematic front, we also struggle at times to find that right sense of humor.

551
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:10,741
Our goal was to make Spider-Man very likable,

552
00:22:10,741 --> 00:22:12,604
but early on, he could come across

553
00:22:12,604 --> 00:22:14,167
as either a wise-ass or even a jerk.

554
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:18,232
Now the scene I want to show you is very early on in Act 2.

555
00:22:18,232 --> 00:22:20,353
Peter's trying to track down Mr. Negative.

556
00:22:20,353 --> 00:22:21,694
He actually goes over to MJ's house.

557
00:22:21,694 --> 00:22:23,095
She's going to help him out.

558
00:22:23,095 --> 00:22:24,136
So he's cooking dinner.

559
00:22:24,136 --> 00:22:27,098
And this is a moment where MJ really opens up to Peter,

560
00:22:27,098 --> 00:22:28,599
confesses that she wants a bigger role

561
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:29,660
in trying to take down Mr. Negative,

562
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,461
even wants to be his partner.

563
00:22:31,461 --> 00:22:32,381
And right before he answers,

564
00:22:32,381 --> 00:22:34,443
something's going on with the food.

565
00:22:34,443 --> 00:22:35,304
He runs in the kitchen.

566
00:22:35,304 --> 00:22:37,245
And this is how the rest of the scene plays out originally.

567
00:22:37,245 --> 00:22:40,327
Now I want to warn you, this is very early version.

568
00:22:40,327 --> 00:22:42,709
There is no facial animation and the lighting is very temp.

569
00:22:42,709 --> 00:22:44,050
So just remember that.

570
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:46,806
Not again!

571
00:22:46,806 --> 00:22:52,748
Hey, it's your crime system thingy.

572
00:22:52,748 --> 00:22:57,089
Looks like a residential break-in.

573
00:22:57,089 --> 00:22:58,329
Charles Standish.

574
00:22:58,329 --> 00:23:00,209
That sounds familiar.

575
00:23:00,209 --> 00:23:00,889
Oh! Oscorp CFO.

576
00:23:00,889 --> 00:23:01,150
Wait.

577
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:09,291
Wait, you don't think this has anything to do with Lee, do you?

578
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:12,712
I guess he does.

579
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:17,785
So for me, we have this strong emotional moment

580
00:23:17,785 --> 00:23:19,007
between MJ and Peter.

581
00:23:19,007 --> 00:23:21,072
She's opening up, she's confessing something to him.

582
00:23:21,072 --> 00:23:24,699
As soon as he gets his information, he just bails.

583
00:23:24,699 --> 00:23:26,122
And to me, this just came across as

584
00:23:26,122 --> 00:23:27,665
he's a little bit of a jerk in this scenario.

585
00:23:29,212 --> 00:23:31,114
And it really wasn't until we got off the page

586
00:23:31,114 --> 00:23:33,757
and really started testing everything in the game

587
00:23:33,757 --> 00:23:36,360
that we understood what players were experiencing

588
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,021
and what we were trying to achieve.

589
00:23:38,021 --> 00:23:40,324
Did we really find our clarity and our tone and voice.

590
00:23:40,324 --> 00:23:42,546
This is how we discovered that constant quips

591
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,548
during every random combat sequence were gonna work.

592
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:47,291
But more importantly, this is where we discovered

593
00:23:47,291 --> 00:23:49,033
that situational humor, humor written

594
00:23:49,033 --> 00:23:50,775
for a very specific moment,

595
00:23:50,775 --> 00:23:51,956
was the right approach for our game.

596
00:23:53,489 --> 00:23:55,510
For example, early in the game, we have a mission

597
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:57,231
that's basically a tutorial for the crime system.

598
00:23:57,231 --> 00:23:59,572
But thanks to our writer, Ben Arfman,

599
00:23:59,572 --> 00:24:02,214
he took this rather dry moment in the game

600
00:24:02,214 --> 00:24:05,155
and was able to craft something pretty memorable.

601
00:24:05,155 --> 00:24:07,176
And with that, Spider Cop was born.

602
00:24:07,176 --> 00:24:10,738
From his elevated position,

603
00:24:10,738 --> 00:24:12,479
Spider Cop spies his destination,

604
00:24:12,479 --> 00:24:14,740
a second surveillance tower.

605
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:17,682
Are you narrating yourself?

606
00:24:17,682 --> 00:24:20,203
What? No, of course not.

607
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:23,921
Chief never did understand Spider Cop.

608
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:25,942
Thought he was a loose cannon.

609
00:24:25,942 --> 00:24:26,602
Already regretted it.

610
00:24:26,602 --> 00:24:26,883
So that's so good.

611
00:24:26,883 --> 00:24:29,004
So one more note about that mission.

612
00:24:29,004 --> 00:24:33,466
I was actually talking to Ben last week.

613
00:24:33,466 --> 00:24:36,908
And I asked him, I go, Ben, how many versions of the script

614
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:38,689
did you work on before we got to Spider Cop?

615
00:24:38,689 --> 00:24:39,509
He goes, 15.

616
00:24:39,509 --> 00:24:39,909
15 scripts.

617
00:24:39,909 --> 00:24:42,791
So you're going to hear me say this a lot today.

618
00:24:42,791 --> 00:24:44,772
I'm sure you're going to hear it a lot at GDC.

619
00:24:44,772 --> 00:24:47,093
Iteration makes all the difference.

620
00:24:48,393 --> 00:24:49,093
Now here's another one.

621
00:24:49,093 --> 00:24:50,813
At the end of the Grand Central Terminal mission,

622
00:24:50,813 --> 00:24:52,754
Spider-Man's trying to slow down a runaway train

623
00:24:52,754 --> 00:24:53,674
and his webs snap.

624
00:24:53,674 --> 00:24:55,194
Listen to how he reacts.

625
00:24:55,194 --> 00:25:06,597
That totally worked last time.

626
00:25:06,597 --> 00:25:09,077
So not only was this video line written specifically

627
00:25:09,077 --> 00:25:10,778
for that situation, but we also recognized

628
00:25:10,778 --> 00:25:12,378
that we could give a little wink and a nod

629
00:25:12,378 --> 00:25:14,439
to a very memorable Spider-Man 2 movie sequence

630
00:25:14,439 --> 00:25:16,739
that was somewhat also involved with the train.

631
00:25:18,278 --> 00:25:19,699
And remember that scene I showed you earlier

632
00:25:19,699 --> 00:25:22,281
about MJ's apartment, where he kind of bailed on her

633
00:25:22,281 --> 00:25:22,902
like a jerk?

634
00:25:22,902 --> 00:25:24,463
Well, the good news is that we were able

635
00:25:24,463 --> 00:25:26,224
to go back to that scene, and the writers and animators

636
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:29,346
said, you know, we could just tweak the very end part of it

637
00:25:29,346 --> 00:25:30,747
and really increase his likability

638
00:25:30,747 --> 00:25:32,888
with some classic Spider-Man humor.

639
00:25:32,888 --> 00:25:35,350
And this is how that played out.

640
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:39,993
Hey, it's your crime system thingy.

641
00:25:39,993 --> 00:25:43,776
Looks like a residential break-in.

642
00:25:43,776 --> 00:25:46,498
Charles Standish.

643
00:25:46,498 --> 00:25:47,318
That sounds familiar.

644
00:25:48,775 --> 00:25:50,036
Oh, Oscorp CFO.

645
00:25:50,036 --> 00:25:50,196
Wait.

646
00:25:50,196 --> 00:25:55,659
You don't think this has anything to do with Lee, do you?

647
00:25:55,659 --> 00:25:58,281
Sorry to cook and run.

648
00:25:58,281 --> 00:25:58,401
Did...

649
00:25:58,401 --> 00:26:11,430
Did you just leave your clothes on the kitchen floor?

650
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:11,610
Uh...

651
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:13,311
Where do you want me to, uh...

652
00:26:13,311 --> 00:26:14,251
Just a couch is fine.

653
00:26:14,251 --> 00:26:16,993
See you later?

654
00:26:16,993 --> 00:26:17,173
Yeah.

655
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,661
So another thing about that scene I just remembered,

656
00:26:25,661 --> 00:26:27,142
the whole walking backwards thing,

657
00:26:27,142 --> 00:26:29,003
that was just our actor, Uri Lowenthal,

658
00:26:29,003 --> 00:26:30,885
just doing it on set, wasn't written.

659
00:26:30,885 --> 00:26:33,587
And another thing is just let your actors have fun on stage

660
00:26:33,587 --> 00:26:35,649
and they're gonna make it better than ever you wrote it.

661
00:26:35,649 --> 00:26:37,450
Now what we do with that apartment scene

662
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:40,553
ties into our next creative challenge on the game journey,

663
00:26:40,553 --> 00:26:44,196
character and story comprehension and cohesion.

664
00:26:44,196 --> 00:26:47,058
So you spend all this time with your writers,

665
00:26:47,058 --> 00:26:48,279
your developers, your producers,

666
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:50,041
and your partners working on a script.

667
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:51,902
Everyone is bought in and you're feeling really good.

668
00:26:53,377 --> 00:26:54,557
But now you're in the middle of development

669
00:26:54,557 --> 00:26:55,938
and you're spending thousands of dollars

670
00:26:55,938 --> 00:26:58,519
on performance capture, processing mocap data,

671
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:00,801
and not to mention getting your internal cinematic team

672
00:27:00,801 --> 00:27:03,502
ready to make these scenes look and sound beautiful.

673
00:27:03,502 --> 00:27:06,104
But then you start playing and seeing everything

674
00:27:06,104 --> 00:27:08,625
in the game and boom, there's big problems.

675
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:10,226
Worse, the schedule is already packed

676
00:27:10,226 --> 00:27:11,326
to get the rest of the game done.

677
00:27:12,843 --> 00:27:15,084
our failure was not planning enough for change.

678
00:27:15,084 --> 00:27:16,505
And I feel like a lot of this falls on me

679
00:27:16,505 --> 00:27:18,186
because of the first time creative director,

680
00:27:18,186 --> 00:27:20,368
which I'm gonna talk about more in the next section.

681
00:27:20,368 --> 00:27:23,329
I became so obsessed with nailing everything on the page

682
00:27:23,329 --> 00:27:26,071
that I underestimated how much it would eventually change

683
00:27:26,071 --> 00:27:27,812
once we got in the game.

684
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,134
I didn't anticipate this many issues arising

685
00:27:30,134 --> 00:27:34,036
and I didn't plan for needing this many edits and reshoots.

686
00:27:34,036 --> 00:27:36,658
Here are just some of the narrative issues

687
00:27:36,658 --> 00:27:37,979
that we found both early on

688
00:27:37,979 --> 00:27:39,720
and as late of nine to 12 months before ship.

689
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,361
Act two had large gaps with no humor.

690
00:27:42,736 --> 00:27:44,457
The Miles Morales character wasn't as likable

691
00:27:44,457 --> 00:27:45,178
as we were hoping for.

692
00:27:45,178 --> 00:27:47,179
He came across as more of an angry kid.

693
00:27:47,179 --> 00:27:50,802
Otto's turn into a villain wasn't as believable

694
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:51,142
as we hoped.

695
00:27:51,142 --> 00:27:53,924
And we weren't selling Otto's master plan,

696
00:27:53,924 --> 00:27:56,266
his plan to get back at Norman Osborn well enough.

697
00:27:56,266 --> 00:27:58,328
Players couldn't go back and think about and go,

698
00:27:58,328 --> 00:28:00,269
oh, that's how that all adds up now.

699
00:28:00,269 --> 00:28:02,451
So what did we do?

700
00:28:02,451 --> 00:28:04,212
We asked for help.

701
00:28:04,212 --> 00:28:05,373
We asked for a lot of help.

702
00:28:06,806 --> 00:28:08,628
First off, we had to go to our publisher, Sony,

703
00:28:08,628 --> 00:28:10,830
and ask for a lot more performance capture days

704
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,451
in order to complete a bunch of reshoots.

705
00:28:12,451 --> 00:28:14,253
And now they could have easily said to us,

706
00:28:14,253 --> 00:28:15,955
sorry, you got a specific budget,

707
00:28:15,955 --> 00:28:17,436
and you gotta make do with what you have.

708
00:28:17,436 --> 00:28:18,898
I know that happens a lot.

709
00:28:18,898 --> 00:28:21,280
But luckily for us, it was the exact opposite.

710
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,062
The support we received from our Sony producers

711
00:28:23,062 --> 00:28:26,025
to go ahead and make those story changes was unbelievable,

712
00:28:26,025 --> 00:28:27,186
and I can't thank them enough.

713
00:28:29,418 --> 00:28:32,780
In addition to our publisher, a huge amount of help, as much,

714
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,661
came from an internal team.

715
00:28:34,661 --> 00:28:36,262
On Insomniac's from literally every single department,

716
00:28:36,262 --> 00:28:38,463
whether it was writing, animation, design, everywhere,

717
00:28:38,463 --> 00:28:40,124
we're looking at our existing scenes

718
00:28:40,124 --> 00:28:42,545
and saying, how could we strategically edit, or maybe

719
00:28:42,545 --> 00:28:44,826
add something to the very end, or the very front?

720
00:28:44,826 --> 00:28:46,607
And this is, I really feel like, when

721
00:28:46,607 --> 00:28:47,807
Insomniac's truly at its best.

722
00:28:50,313 --> 00:28:52,353
So here's an example.

723
00:28:52,353 --> 00:28:54,854
After that train sequence, Spider-Man, spoiler,

724
00:28:54,854 --> 00:28:57,575
takes down Mr. Negative, and he has this short scene

725
00:28:57,575 --> 00:28:59,836
with MJ where he's just texting her back and forth.

726
00:28:59,836 --> 00:29:02,236
And originally, this was just, we had a budget for it,

727
00:29:02,236 --> 00:29:04,237
it was gonna be short and sweet to the point.

728
00:29:04,237 --> 00:29:06,557
And luckily, during this time, we were trying to fix

729
00:29:06,557 --> 00:29:08,438
some of the humor issues and kind of more

730
00:29:08,438 --> 00:29:10,639
that humor story, the writers and animators said,

731
00:29:10,639 --> 00:29:12,299
you know what, we already have this budget for this scene,

732
00:29:12,299 --> 00:29:13,940
what if we just extend it a little bit?

733
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:17,262
rewrites some of the dialogue to sound more like how people

734
00:29:17,262 --> 00:29:20,005
really text, and then have him doing Spider-Man things

735
00:29:20,005 --> 00:29:22,767
while he's texting, because that's what Spider-Man would do.

736
00:29:22,767 --> 00:29:25,069
And also, hopefully, this will help address

737
00:29:25,069 --> 00:29:26,890
some of the lack of humor criticism.

738
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,772
And this is how the scene eventually turned out.

739
00:29:28,772 --> 00:29:29,312
This is Mary Jane Watson.

740
00:29:29,312 --> 00:29:31,835
Please leave a detailed message,

741
00:29:31,835 --> 00:29:33,076
and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

742
00:29:33,076 --> 00:29:33,496
Hey, it's me.

743
00:29:33,496 --> 00:29:36,218
Let me know when you want to talk.

744
00:29:44,188 --> 00:29:54,675
Texting isn't talking?

745
00:29:54,675 --> 00:30:08,264
No, no, no, no, not that kind of over!

746
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:17,612
Please say no, please say no.

747
00:30:17,612 --> 00:30:20,133
Ha! Okay, okay.

748
00:30:20,133 --> 00:30:25,277
And not okay.

749
00:30:25,277 --> 00:30:36,405
What is there to figure out?

750
00:30:36,405 --> 00:30:39,987
Oh, you think?

751
00:30:54,257 --> 00:30:58,037
And that scene was never supposed to be like that.

752
00:30:58,037 --> 00:31:00,538
It was supposed to be about a 10 second scene,

753
00:31:00,538 --> 00:31:02,178
and now that's probably one of my favorite scenes

754
00:31:02,178 --> 00:31:02,939
we ever worked on.

755
00:31:02,939 --> 00:31:04,799
And that's what I say by,

756
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,499
it's something I'll talk about later,

757
00:31:06,499 --> 00:31:08,560
once you hand over a problem to your team,

758
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,200
the magic they can make is just spectacular.

759
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,361
It's one of the best parts of game development.

760
00:31:12,361 --> 00:31:13,181
So when it comes to takeaways,

761
00:31:13,181 --> 00:31:18,022
I believe these hold true for a new IP and existing one.

762
00:31:19,411 --> 00:31:21,916
Go beyond the script and get off the page

763
00:31:21,916 --> 00:31:23,319
as soon as possible.

764
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:24,682
It's unrealistic and quite unwise

765
00:31:24,682 --> 00:31:26,726
to think that you can script out the whole game

766
00:31:26,726 --> 00:31:28,369
and just go ahead, shoot, and record it.

767
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:31,511
Continuous iteration and place testing

768
00:31:31,511 --> 00:31:33,872
is how you'll discover the correct tone for your game,

769
00:31:33,872 --> 00:31:36,373
the right cadence for humor, and see if the overall story

770
00:31:36,373 --> 00:31:37,554
is clicking for players.

771
00:31:37,554 --> 00:31:40,255
This is going to sound obvious, but have as many people

772
00:31:40,255 --> 00:31:42,496
play the game as much as possible.

773
00:31:42,496 --> 00:31:44,437
Playtest internally, externally.

774
00:31:44,437 --> 00:31:47,278
If you have the availability of usability labs,

775
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:49,339
user research, take advantage of them.

776
00:31:49,339 --> 00:31:51,920
And also, don't be afraid to get story feedback when

777
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,401
you have really early builds.

778
00:31:53,905 --> 00:31:56,727
When it's your own developers recording Scratch video,

779
00:31:56,727 --> 00:31:59,668
it's when you're using your Maya Play Blast

780
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:01,449
as cinematic stand-ins.

781
00:32:01,449 --> 00:32:03,269
You can find it a lot, even when you

782
00:32:03,269 --> 00:32:05,610
don't have all the bells and whistles of a shippable polish

783
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:06,311
game.

784
00:32:06,311 --> 00:32:09,912
And something I believe holds true for not just Spider-Man,

785
00:32:09,912 --> 00:32:11,953
but for any game, situational humor

786
00:32:11,953 --> 00:32:13,494
is more effective than jokes.

787
00:32:13,494 --> 00:32:15,695
A little of the latter can make a big difference.

788
00:32:17,504 --> 00:32:20,626
And lastly, something I talked about was schedule and plan

789
00:32:20,626 --> 00:32:21,407
for change.

790
00:32:21,407 --> 00:32:23,729
We were really, really fortunate to have that support from Sony.

791
00:32:23,729 --> 00:32:26,430
But we know that's not realistic in every situation.

792
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:28,272
Some games have very tight budgets,

793
00:32:28,272 --> 00:32:29,773
and that's what they have to deal with.

794
00:32:29,773 --> 00:32:33,255
So something I kind of thought about as a postmortem

795
00:32:33,255 --> 00:32:34,876
for this game was things that you

796
00:32:34,876 --> 00:32:37,498
can do from a production side to help deal with change.

797
00:32:39,635 --> 00:32:42,917
Early on, block out unknowns from the schedule.

798
00:32:42,917 --> 00:32:44,698
I know the instinct is to plan out everything

799
00:32:44,698 --> 00:32:46,620
to the last hour and the last resource,

800
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,941
especially when you have someone like me

801
00:32:47,941 --> 00:32:49,102
as a creative director who's going,

802
00:32:49,102 --> 00:32:51,223
we're gonna, it's gonna all fit, right?

803
00:32:51,223 --> 00:32:53,245
It's gonna fit, it's gonna fit, it's gonna fit.

804
00:32:53,245 --> 00:32:55,446
You know, we're gonna go get this story done, right?

805
00:32:55,446 --> 00:32:57,368
But in reality, no one can predict,

806
00:32:57,368 --> 00:32:59,489
even a former producer, now a creative director,

807
00:32:59,489 --> 00:33:01,511
how much stuff you're gonna have to need to address,

808
00:33:01,511 --> 00:33:03,032
how much stuff you're gonna have to change.

809
00:33:03,032 --> 00:33:03,872
So really, hedge your bets.

810
00:33:04,693 --> 00:33:06,034
And more importantly, and this is especially

811
00:33:06,034 --> 00:33:07,655
for the producers and the crowd,

812
00:33:07,655 --> 00:33:10,176
hold onto those unknowns for dear life.

813
00:33:10,176 --> 00:33:11,337
Don't start filling them in

814
00:33:11,337 --> 00:33:13,699
while someone, the scope of the game gets bigger.

815
00:33:13,699 --> 00:33:15,160
More often than not, as I mentioned,

816
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,321
things aren't gonna go as planned

817
00:33:16,321 --> 00:33:18,982
and something will slip or something in the story will change.

818
00:33:18,982 --> 00:33:21,104
Do whatever you can to not eat into the unknown block.

819
00:33:21,104 --> 00:33:23,645
And while your CD may be irritated at first,

820
00:33:23,645 --> 00:33:25,807
and you may have some tough discussions about scope,

821
00:33:25,807 --> 00:33:30,370
I can promise you that they will thank you down the road.

822
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:33,072
And I just have to remember that in my next project.

823
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,461
And if things are going wrong, own up to it as soon as possible.

824
00:33:38,461 --> 00:33:41,342
One of the worst things you can do is let your production partners be the ones

825
00:33:41,342 --> 00:33:43,023
pointing out the problem.

826
00:33:43,023 --> 00:33:46,924
Bring them into the fold as early as possible to help you right the ship.

827
00:33:46,924 --> 00:33:50,906
Delaying that inevitable conversation will only make things worse.

828
00:33:50,906 --> 00:33:55,128
Now, the last part of this journey I want to discuss today is specifically my journey,

829
00:33:55,128 --> 00:33:56,688
the journey of being a first-time creative director.

830
00:33:58,312 --> 00:34:01,373
I'm sure you've all heard this famous Spider-Man line before,

831
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:04,074
with great power must also come great responsibility.

832
00:34:04,074 --> 00:34:06,695
In some ways, I feel like that really captures

833
00:34:06,695 --> 00:34:07,896
what it's like to be a creative director.

834
00:34:07,896 --> 00:34:10,697
When I became a creative director in Spider-Man,

835
00:34:10,697 --> 00:34:12,818
I knew this would be like no other game I ever worked on

836
00:34:12,818 --> 00:34:14,398
and the expectations would be amazingly high.

837
00:34:15,927 --> 00:34:18,168
From day one, our goal was to make the best Spider-Man game

838
00:34:18,168 --> 00:34:19,309
we've all been waiting for.

839
00:34:19,309 --> 00:34:21,230
You wouldn't just hear that from our fans,

840
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,450
but also from our own team.

841
00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:23,911
And again, we weren't talking about just making

842
00:34:23,911 --> 00:34:25,492
a great Spider-Man game.

843
00:34:25,492 --> 00:34:26,873
From day one, we were talking about,

844
00:34:26,873 --> 00:34:28,214
could this be a game of the year contender?

845
00:34:30,003 --> 00:34:31,926
This was also when Insomniac forced 4A

846
00:34:31,926 --> 00:34:33,288
into making a license game.

847
00:34:33,288 --> 00:34:34,891
And once people thought about our previous titles

848
00:34:34,891 --> 00:34:36,012
and the quality of those titles,

849
00:34:36,012 --> 00:34:37,534
there was gonna be a lot of built-in trust

850
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:38,496
that we would get it right.

851
00:34:38,496 --> 00:34:40,078
We didn't wanna mess with that.

852
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,822
And the In Insomniac we trust was actually something

853
00:34:42,822 --> 00:34:44,244
fans created and created a hashtag,

854
00:34:44,244 --> 00:34:46,267
which every time I saw it would make me sweat.

855
00:34:47,548 --> 00:34:49,870
This was also an unprecedented collaboration

856
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:51,372
between Insomniac, Sony, and Marvel,

857
00:34:51,372 --> 00:34:53,793
and in one way or another, each one was taking a risk.

858
00:34:53,793 --> 00:34:55,655
So while I understood the responsibilities

859
00:34:55,655 --> 00:34:57,517
of being able to make a great game,

860
00:34:57,517 --> 00:34:59,578
I either underestimated or quite frankly didn't know

861
00:34:59,578 --> 00:35:00,819
the other responsibilities that came

862
00:35:00,819 --> 00:35:02,140
with becoming a creative director.

863
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:06,023
And while I was unbelievably excited about this opportunity,

864
00:35:06,023 --> 00:35:07,805
I was also unbelievably petrified.

865
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:11,047
Early on, I was asking myself questions like,

866
00:35:11,047 --> 00:35:12,629
so I came from a production background.

867
00:35:12,629 --> 00:35:14,330
Would the team believe I could be a creative director?

868
00:35:15,471 --> 00:35:16,911
Right off the bat, we were talking about this being

869
00:35:16,911 --> 00:35:18,272
the biggest and most important game

870
00:35:18,272 --> 00:35:19,592
in Insomniac's 25-year history.

871
00:35:19,592 --> 00:35:21,553
Should someone who's never been a CD

872
00:35:21,553 --> 00:35:23,373
be the one leading the project?

873
00:35:23,373 --> 00:35:26,114
And this is something I seriously asked myself

874
00:35:26,114 --> 00:35:27,754
and even talked to my wife about was,

875
00:35:27,754 --> 00:35:30,035
what if I go down as the person who screwed up Spider-Man?

876
00:35:30,035 --> 00:35:32,055
Will I even have a career after this?

877
00:35:32,055 --> 00:35:34,176
So as excited as I was to be working with

878
00:35:34,176 --> 00:35:36,096
one of my childhood heroes,

879
00:35:36,096 --> 00:35:38,857
I was also petrified and worried that people would figure out

880
00:35:38,857 --> 00:35:40,597
that I wasn't the right person for the job.

881
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:43,098
I'm sure you've also heard the phrase,

882
00:35:43,098 --> 00:35:44,078
fake it till you make it.

883
00:35:44,635 --> 00:35:46,838
That did not work for me at all.

884
00:35:46,838 --> 00:35:49,260
And this started really early in development.

885
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,823
I remember one of our first project meetings with Sony.

886
00:35:51,823 --> 00:35:54,346
We were just really high-level talks.

887
00:35:54,346 --> 00:35:56,288
And for some reason, I was off that next day.

888
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,670
And I called Ted Price, our president.

889
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:59,972
And I said, hey, Ted, how do you think it went?

890
00:35:59,972 --> 00:36:00,353
And he goes.

891
00:36:01,094 --> 00:36:02,095
Could have gone better.

892
00:36:02,095 --> 00:36:04,759
And I was like, oh, well, could you tell me more?

893
00:36:04,759 --> 00:36:07,283
And he started mentioning all these things that happened.

894
00:36:07,283 --> 00:36:10,668
Like I was interrupting pretty frequently.

895
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:11,550
I wasn't open to ideas,

896
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:14,234
especially when we were very early in the brainstorming phase

897
00:36:14,234 --> 00:36:14,935
and other things.

898
00:36:14,935 --> 00:36:16,538
And this really, really blew me away.

899
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:22,112
And I don't think of myself as a very rude or closed-minded

900
00:36:22,112 --> 00:36:22,472
person.

901
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:23,373
I hope that's not the case.

902
00:36:23,373 --> 00:36:24,394
I don't think so.

903
00:36:24,394 --> 00:36:26,656
And I remember I was driving home the Pacific Coast Highway.

904
00:36:26,656 --> 00:36:27,736
My sister was actually in town.

905
00:36:27,736 --> 00:36:29,117
I was visiting her.

906
00:36:29,117 --> 00:36:31,479
And I started to realize that after talking to Ted

907
00:36:31,479 --> 00:36:34,161
was I was trying to show Sony that I was confident

908
00:36:34,161 --> 00:36:35,282
in my ability to do the job.

909
00:36:35,282 --> 00:36:37,684
Actually came across as cocky and somewhat of a know-it-all.

910
00:36:39,067 --> 00:36:40,187
And this really shook me.

911
00:36:40,187 --> 00:36:42,608
And what happened next, in some ways, was even worse.

912
00:36:42,608 --> 00:36:44,089
During the next few meetings with Sony,

913
00:36:44,089 --> 00:36:45,349
I actually became very hesitant

914
00:36:45,349 --> 00:36:46,770
and was constantly concerned

915
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:48,731
that what I was gonna say next.

916
00:36:48,731 --> 00:36:50,771
Result, I was so worried about offending someone,

917
00:36:50,771 --> 00:36:53,032
whether it was Sony or even a fellow Insomniac,

918
00:36:53,032 --> 00:36:55,693
that I didn't come across as a leader with a strong vision.

919
00:36:55,693 --> 00:36:57,254
Again, I wasn't in a very good place.

920
00:36:58,895 --> 00:37:00,836
Now on this game I was very fortunate to have Mark Cerny

921
00:37:00,836 --> 00:37:02,377
as one of my Sony producers.

922
00:37:02,377 --> 00:37:04,519
Mark is an industry veteran who's been involved

923
00:37:04,519 --> 00:37:06,340
in several previous Insomniac tales.

924
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,481
And aside from his producer duties,

925
00:37:08,481 --> 00:37:10,483
Mark pretty much became my mentor.

926
00:37:10,483 --> 00:37:11,964
I remember one day early in the project,

927
00:37:11,964 --> 00:37:13,124
he asked me to go out to lunch.

928
00:37:13,124 --> 00:37:15,466
It was almost like he could sense someone was off.

929
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:17,547
And during that conversation we talked a lot

930
00:37:17,547 --> 00:37:19,829
about the industry, the role of being a creative director,

931
00:37:19,829 --> 00:37:21,310
other CDs he worked with,

932
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:23,932
and he's worked with some really talented people.

933
00:37:23,932 --> 00:37:25,513
And he emphasized to me that I had to find

934
00:37:25,513 --> 00:37:27,574
and develop my own approach to leading this project.

935
00:37:29,394 --> 00:37:30,975
So I thought a lot about what Mark said.

936
00:37:30,975 --> 00:37:33,277
And what I began to realize was that I

937
00:37:33,277 --> 00:37:35,238
had this fear of this overwhelming feeling

938
00:37:35,238 --> 00:37:37,080
that I had to have everything figured out

939
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,562
about the game before anyone ever asked the question,

940
00:37:39,562 --> 00:37:40,342
again, because I doubted myself.

941
00:37:40,342 --> 00:37:43,585
And now, sure, all creative directors

942
00:37:43,585 --> 00:37:46,487
need that strong vision of the game, which I believe I did.

943
00:37:46,487 --> 00:37:49,109
But you also need people around you to help cultivate

944
00:37:49,109 --> 00:37:51,030
that vision, perfect that vision,

945
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:53,012
thus giving you confidence to sell to a larger group.

946
00:37:53,012 --> 00:37:55,273
What I needed to find was my leadership team.

947
00:37:57,077 --> 00:37:58,177
And that's exactly what I did.

948
00:37:58,177 --> 00:38:01,978
I began leaning on folks like Ryan Smith, our game director,

949
00:38:01,978 --> 00:38:03,459
who's pretty much been my partner in crime

950
00:38:03,459 --> 00:38:03,899
for the last decade.

951
00:38:03,899 --> 00:38:06,940
And I joke, but it's true, and he hates I say this,

952
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,240
but I'm gonna say it anyway.

953
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,541
He pretty much taught me how video games were made,

954
00:38:10,541 --> 00:38:12,561
along with Doug Sheehan.

955
00:38:12,561 --> 00:38:13,782
Jacinda Chu, our art director,

956
00:38:13,782 --> 00:38:16,222
who I had the utmost confidence could help define

957
00:38:16,222 --> 00:38:19,043
our visual style for our world and characters.

958
00:38:19,043 --> 00:38:20,184
Jon Paquette, our lead writer,

959
00:38:20,184 --> 00:38:21,724
who is probably the most patient person

960
00:38:21,724 --> 00:38:22,484
I've ever worked with,

961
00:38:22,484 --> 00:38:24,345
and one of the best collaborators

962
00:38:24,345 --> 00:38:25,645
any creative director could ask for.

963
00:38:27,016 --> 00:38:29,118
And then there's Bobby Coddington, our animation

964
00:38:29,118 --> 00:38:31,379
director, who no challenge is too big for Bobby.

965
00:38:31,379 --> 00:38:33,801
And what I loved about him was that he

966
00:38:33,801 --> 00:38:35,843
would push me as hard as he would push his own team

967
00:38:35,843 --> 00:38:38,025
to make something incredible.

968
00:38:38,025 --> 00:38:40,447
And then there's Scott Mahalik, our lead project manager.

969
00:38:40,447 --> 00:38:42,468
And I've known Scott since he was a teenager.

970
00:38:42,468 --> 00:38:43,789
We worked together at GameStop.

971
00:38:43,789 --> 00:38:45,390
And to tell you how old I am, it was called

972
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:46,551
Software Etcetera back then.

973
00:38:47,978 --> 00:38:49,959
And what was great was he was always looking at the game

974
00:38:49,959 --> 00:38:50,519
from two perspectives.

975
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:52,301
Of course, what we need to get done

976
00:38:52,301 --> 00:38:53,922
is ship the game on time.

977
00:38:53,922 --> 00:38:55,483
But because he was such a big gamer,

978
00:38:55,483 --> 00:38:57,664
and I valued his opinion as a gamer,

979
00:38:57,664 --> 00:38:59,425
he was also helping provide guidance on decisions

980
00:38:59,425 --> 00:39:01,186
that would make the game qualitatively better.

981
00:39:01,186 --> 00:39:03,708
These people, and several others

982
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:05,349
who became part of my leadership team,

983
00:39:05,349 --> 00:39:07,750
like Doug Sheehan, our lead programmer,

984
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:09,771
and Cameron Christian, our lead designer,

985
00:39:09,771 --> 00:39:11,553
are who I leaned on to help perfect this vision

986
00:39:11,553 --> 00:39:13,234
and make me feel much more confident

987
00:39:13,234 --> 00:39:14,775
in the creative direction of the game.

988
00:39:19,295 --> 00:39:20,575
Now the next creative challenge of my journey

989
00:39:20,575 --> 00:39:23,117
was collaborating with multiple stakeholders.

990
00:39:23,117 --> 00:39:25,979
Most projects have two, your developer and your publisher.

991
00:39:25,979 --> 00:39:27,640
But us, we had a third, Marvel Games.

992
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:31,602
Now on the positive side, all three groups

993
00:39:31,602 --> 00:39:33,443
were extremely collaborative and shared a common goal

994
00:39:33,443 --> 00:39:34,284
to make the best game possible.

995
00:39:34,284 --> 00:39:37,686
And as you might expect, we received a lot of feedback

996
00:39:37,686 --> 00:39:38,726
from the game from Sony and Marvel.

997
00:39:38,726 --> 00:39:41,408
And sometimes there were differing opinions.

998
00:39:42,683 --> 00:39:43,684
And that's not unusual.

999
00:39:43,684 --> 00:39:46,266
If you come to Insomniac and you put three people in a room,

1000
00:39:46,266 --> 00:39:48,447
I can guarantee you they're going to disagree on things.

1001
00:39:48,447 --> 00:39:49,428
And that's normal.

1002
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:51,770
That's what eventually makes things better.

1003
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:52,690
That's game development.

1004
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:55,252
But here's where I failed, and I failed miserably.

1005
00:39:55,252 --> 00:39:57,373
Hands down, the biggest failure I had on this project.

1006
00:39:59,018 --> 00:40:00,819
When issues were brought up by our executive team,

1007
00:40:00,819 --> 00:40:02,999
Sony and Marvel, I routinely would go in a room,

1008
00:40:02,999 --> 00:40:05,740
either by myself or with one or two people,

1009
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:07,200
and try to solve the problem.

1010
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,441
I would rarely bring it to the larger team.

1011
00:40:09,441 --> 00:40:10,621
In my mind, I was protecting them.

1012
00:40:10,621 --> 00:40:12,441
Like I said, we were talking about this being

1013
00:40:12,441 --> 00:40:14,222
the biggest game Insomniac ever made.

1014
00:40:14,222 --> 00:40:15,842
They already had so much work.

1015
00:40:15,842 --> 00:40:16,922
They already had a lot of stress.

1016
00:40:16,922 --> 00:40:18,843
I didn't want to burden them with something else.

1017
00:40:18,843 --> 00:40:20,123
But I quickly learned I was actually

1018
00:40:20,123 --> 00:40:21,223
doing the complete opposite.

1019
00:40:21,223 --> 00:40:23,884
I was actually alienating myself from the team.

1020
00:40:23,884 --> 00:40:25,684
They would make jokes like, oh my God,

1021
00:40:25,684 --> 00:40:27,004
it's been like a month since you've been

1022
00:40:27,004 --> 00:40:28,345
at the back of your desk.

1023
00:40:28,705 --> 00:40:32,268
And I learned, quite frankly, I was pissing them off.

1024
00:40:32,268 --> 00:40:34,671
So during development on Spider-Man, we actually

1025
00:40:34,671 --> 00:40:35,912
had an off-site leadership meeting

1026
00:40:35,912 --> 00:40:38,755
where all the execs, the leads, and directors came together.

1027
00:40:38,755 --> 00:40:39,776
And during that meeting, we talked

1028
00:40:39,776 --> 00:40:40,557
up a lot of different things.

1029
00:40:40,557 --> 00:40:42,158
But actually, at one point, actually, it

1030
00:40:42,158 --> 00:40:45,322
turned into how I could be doing a better job

1031
00:40:45,322 --> 00:40:46,783
as creative director.

1032
00:40:46,783 --> 00:40:49,806
And after two hours and taking a lot of pages of notes,

1033
00:40:49,806 --> 00:40:50,867
it kind of felt like this.

1034
00:40:59,195 --> 00:41:02,777
Now they kept saying, hey, we want to be more involved.

1035
00:41:02,777 --> 00:41:03,797
Come to us with a problem.

1036
00:41:03,797 --> 00:41:05,398
We're going to help you solve it.

1037
00:41:05,398 --> 00:41:07,339
And I also learned in this meeting

1038
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:09,920
that I actually had the same habit of when I had

1039
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,381
my own feedback on the game.

1040
00:41:11,381 --> 00:41:12,782
I would go right into solution mode

1041
00:41:12,782 --> 00:41:14,843
rather than saying the problem.

1042
00:41:14,843 --> 00:41:17,184
As this clip illustrated at the very end,

1043
00:41:17,184 --> 00:41:18,905
it was a real eye opener for me.

1044
00:41:18,905 --> 00:41:20,665
And truth be told, this was probably the most,

1045
00:41:20,665 --> 00:41:23,907
the toughest meeting I've ever sat through at Insomniac,

1046
00:41:23,907 --> 00:41:25,088
but it was probably the most informative.

1047
00:41:27,244 --> 00:41:29,104
So the answer to this challenge was full transparency

1048
00:41:29,104 --> 00:41:31,905
with the team and letting them be the owners of the solution.

1049
00:41:31,905 --> 00:41:33,765
After that meeting, any time we got feedback

1050
00:41:33,765 --> 00:41:36,906
from Sony or Marvel, it was sent out immediately to the team.

1051
00:41:36,906 --> 00:41:38,907
If I had my own issues with the game,

1052
00:41:38,907 --> 00:41:41,067
I would talk directly to the lead and the team

1053
00:41:41,067 --> 00:41:42,247
about my concerns.

1054
00:41:42,247 --> 00:41:44,928
I tried really hard to just state the problem, not

1055
00:41:44,928 --> 00:41:46,128
the solution.

1056
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:47,928
And what I found was this was actually really freeing.

1057
00:41:47,928 --> 00:41:50,469
I had much more time to actually play the game,

1058
00:41:50,469 --> 00:41:52,969
look at it from a much higher level, big-picker perspective.

1059
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:55,530
And when the team did need me to jump in on something,

1060
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:56,710
I actually had the time to do it.

1061
00:41:58,578 --> 00:42:01,078
I feel like a good example of this was our combat system.

1062
00:42:01,078 --> 00:42:02,699
As we entered the final phase of development,

1063
00:42:02,699 --> 00:42:05,460
there were still some things we wanted to work on in combat.

1064
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:07,420
And I quickly recognized, based on that feedback

1065
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:08,680
I'd received during leadership meeting,

1066
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,981
they did not need another cook in the kitchen

1067
00:42:10,981 --> 00:42:11,781
on a daily basis.

1068
00:42:11,781 --> 00:42:13,922
So what I basically did was I gave them

1069
00:42:13,922 --> 00:42:16,062
some high-level thoughts on what I thought about combat.

1070
00:42:16,062 --> 00:42:17,843
And I said, hey, anytime you want

1071
00:42:17,843 --> 00:42:19,083
someone to play the game and give you

1072
00:42:19,083 --> 00:42:20,663
some outside perspective, I'm your guy.

1073
00:42:22,321 --> 00:42:23,622
So that's pretty much what I did.

1074
00:42:23,622 --> 00:42:27,365
Every Friday afternoon, I would install a build on my dev kit.

1075
00:42:27,365 --> 00:42:28,466
I would take it home and play the game.

1076
00:42:28,466 --> 00:42:30,808
And I pretty much just write up my impressions on anything new

1077
00:42:30,808 --> 00:42:32,389
and send that feedback to our game director, Ryan,

1078
00:42:32,389 --> 00:42:35,491
our lead designer, Cameron, and our lead combat programmer,

1079
00:42:35,491 --> 00:42:36,132
Adam.

1080
00:42:36,132 --> 00:42:37,713
Again, I tried to focus my feedback

1081
00:42:37,713 --> 00:42:40,055
on my impressions and the changes I was having,

1082
00:42:40,055 --> 00:42:41,016
not giving them solutions.

1083
00:42:42,635 --> 00:42:44,559
So this gave the combat team complete ownership

1084
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:45,140
at the task at hand.

1085
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:47,344
And I gotta say, they did an amazing job.

1086
00:42:47,344 --> 00:42:49,748
And it sounds like really easy right now,

1087
00:42:49,748 --> 00:42:52,914
but I still struggle with this every single day.

1088
00:42:52,914 --> 00:42:55,679
State the problem, not the solution.

1089
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:00,568
And of all three journeys we talked about today,

1090
00:43:00,568 --> 00:43:04,030
this is probably easily the most painful to look back on.

1091
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:05,891
But I hope this is a section that all aspiring

1092
00:43:05,891 --> 00:43:07,172
creative directors can keep in mind

1093
00:43:07,172 --> 00:43:08,873
and learn from my mistakes.

1094
00:43:08,873 --> 00:43:10,814
And remember, even as a creative director,

1095
00:43:10,814 --> 00:43:13,195
it's okay to have fears, doubts, and insecurities.

1096
00:43:13,195 --> 00:43:16,277
But don't let them overwhelm or consume you.

1097
00:43:16,277 --> 00:43:17,978
Find people to help you improve

1098
00:43:17,978 --> 00:43:19,619
and be more confident in your vision,

1099
00:43:19,619 --> 00:43:21,260
even if that equates into some tough love.

1100
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:24,722
Be transparent with your team.

1101
00:43:24,722 --> 00:43:26,924
Don't try to be a superhero and overprotect them.

1102
00:43:26,924 --> 00:43:28,405
It will most likely backfire

1103
00:43:28,405 --> 00:43:29,847
and lead to a very uninspired team.

1104
00:43:29,847 --> 00:43:32,730
So share feedback from your production partners

1105
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:33,550
whenever you receive it,

1106
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:35,332
and then hand over the problem to your team.

1107
00:43:35,332 --> 00:43:37,975
Get them invested in coming up with a solution.

1108
00:43:37,975 --> 00:43:39,256
I will bet you, more often than not,

1109
00:43:39,256 --> 00:43:40,517
what they deliver will be better

1110
00:43:40,517 --> 00:43:42,159
than anything you can imagine.

1111
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:43,980
That's one of the magical parts of game development.

1112
00:43:46,055 --> 00:43:48,659
Now, I know there's some insomniacs in the crowd today,

1113
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:51,143
and they know I like to end my presentations

1114
00:43:51,143 --> 00:43:52,005
with one more thing.

1115
00:43:52,005 --> 00:43:54,729
So I figured I'd keep that trend going today.

1116
00:43:54,729 --> 00:43:57,154
I want to tell you guys a story in the final moments

1117
00:43:57,154 --> 00:43:58,015
of development.

1118
00:43:59,467 --> 00:44:01,788
We were about six weeks away from gold.

1119
00:44:01,788 --> 00:44:03,709
It was after E3, and I was in a room reviewing

1120
00:44:03,709 --> 00:44:06,530
the final boss fight in the game, Pete versus Otto.

1121
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:09,091
Now, this was hands down the boss fight

1122
00:44:09,091 --> 00:44:10,912
that went through the most iteration.

1123
00:44:10,912 --> 00:44:14,673
A lot of restarts from both narrative side, design side.

1124
00:44:14,673 --> 00:44:15,894
But I remember in that moment,

1125
00:44:15,894 --> 00:44:17,715
even with little bugs here and there,

1126
00:44:17,715 --> 00:44:19,935
some lighting issues, some sound effect issues,

1127
00:44:19,935 --> 00:44:22,176
I remember sitting in the middle of the room,

1128
00:44:22,176 --> 00:44:23,457
people flanked around me,

1129
00:44:23,457 --> 00:44:25,138
and I had this giant smile on my face.

1130
00:44:25,138 --> 00:44:26,838
I even think someone said, why are you smiling?

1131
00:44:27,459 --> 00:44:29,380
And because in that moment, I said to myself,

1132
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:31,622
this was the perfect collision of Spider-Man and Peter's

1133
00:44:31,622 --> 00:44:32,663
Worlds colliding.

1134
00:44:32,663 --> 00:44:36,586
In that moment, I saw everything finally coming together.

1135
00:44:36,586 --> 00:44:38,487
The writing, the music, the animation,

1136
00:44:38,487 --> 00:44:41,009
all were elevating the stakes and the emotion of that moment.

1137
00:44:41,009 --> 00:44:44,472
In that moment, I saw that the team had not only

1138
00:44:44,472 --> 00:44:46,233
created a great superhero adventure,

1139
00:44:46,233 --> 00:44:47,894
but also a memorable human story, something

1140
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:49,356
we were pushing from day one.

1141
00:44:49,356 --> 00:44:51,417
And in that moment, I started to realize,

1142
00:44:51,417 --> 00:44:54,640
maybe for the first time, that the team had faced and overcome

1143
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,021
our creative challenges.

1144
00:44:58,023 --> 00:45:00,045
As I mentioned earlier, this was a coming of age story

1145
00:45:00,045 --> 00:45:01,687
for Peter, but honestly, it was one for me

1146
00:45:01,687 --> 00:45:02,948
as a creative director.

1147
00:45:02,948 --> 00:45:05,710
Like Pete, this game presented me

1148
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:07,251
with a number of challenges.

1149
00:45:07,251 --> 00:45:09,533
I suffered a lot of failures, as I said.

1150
00:45:09,533 --> 00:45:11,095
But eventually, thanks to a number of people

1151
00:45:11,095 --> 00:45:13,116
in SOMIAC, Sony, and Marvel,

1152
00:45:13,116 --> 00:45:14,858
we developed different strategies on how to conquer them.

1153
00:45:14,858 --> 00:45:17,800
In the end, it's just like Peter relying on MJ,

1154
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,843
Miles, and Aunt May to help him fully realize his potential.

1155
00:45:22,965 --> 00:45:24,385
As you return to your own studios

1156
00:45:24,385 --> 00:45:26,366
to continue work on your current projects,

1157
00:45:26,366 --> 00:45:28,107
I hope my talk today can help you overcome

1158
00:45:28,107 --> 00:45:30,768
some of the challenges you're either currently facing

1159
00:45:30,768 --> 00:45:33,069
or will face in the months and years ahead.

1160
00:45:33,069 --> 00:45:35,790
Thank you so much for coming here today,

1161
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:36,891
and I hope you enjoy the rest of your day.

1162
00:45:45,436 --> 00:45:51,280
I've practiced that about 45 times and I finally hit the exact number I wanted.

1163
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:51,580
So, good.

1164
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:52,441
All right.

1165
00:45:52,441 --> 00:45:56,784
And if anybody has questions, feel free to fire away.

1166
00:45:56,784 --> 00:45:56,844
Hi.

1167
00:45:56,844 --> 00:45:57,004
Hi.

1168
00:45:57,004 --> 00:46:07,211
So, I have to ask, with the release of Into the Spider-Verse, when you watched it, was

1169
00:46:07,211 --> 00:46:08,312
there anything that you were like,

1170
00:46:09,442 --> 00:46:13,765
Dang it, we should have done that.

1171
00:46:13,765 --> 00:46:17,568
I mean, I think just more admiration for what they did,

1172
00:46:17,568 --> 00:46:21,971
from the art style to the banter between all the characters.

1173
00:46:21,971 --> 00:46:23,732
I think they just took some big creative risks.

1174
00:46:23,732 --> 00:46:26,514
I know, thinking about how many playable characters we had

1175
00:46:26,514 --> 00:46:28,196
and all the different Spider-Men,

1176
00:46:28,196 --> 00:46:29,917
when I heard about they were doing the idea of Spider-Verse,

1177
00:46:29,917 --> 00:46:32,579
I was like, how are they gonna juggle and make sense of that?

1178
00:46:32,579 --> 00:46:34,080
Because it's a kind of a complicated storyline,

1179
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:35,441
especially if you've read the comics.

1180
00:46:35,621 --> 00:46:40,082
But I think what was amazing is they took that complex situation and made it very, very

1181
00:46:40,082 --> 00:46:40,842
simple to understand.

1182
00:46:40,842 --> 00:46:44,643
And again, I think what's great about that story is, again, you have that great superhero

1183
00:46:44,643 --> 00:46:47,944
action, but at the end of the day, it's a very human story about Miles and learning

1184
00:46:47,944 --> 00:46:48,504
to be a superhero.

1185
00:46:48,504 --> 00:46:49,184
All right.

1186
00:46:49,184 --> 00:46:49,805
Thanks.

1187
00:46:49,805 --> 00:46:50,265
You're welcome.

1188
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:51,565
Oh, I'm going to go that way.

1189
00:46:51,565 --> 00:46:52,285
All right.

1190
00:46:52,285 --> 00:46:57,787
So we've heard a lot about the heroes of the game today, but I'd like to talk a little

1191
00:46:57,787 --> 00:46:59,187
bit about the villains.

1192
00:46:59,187 --> 00:47:02,688
What were some of the biggest creative challenges introducing the Sinister Six?

1193
00:47:03,806 --> 00:47:07,491
a lot. I would say, or I probably would say, one thing I didn't talk about in this talk,

1194
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:11,656
but we probably spent as much time, if not more, on getting the villains right. Something

1195
00:47:11,656 --> 00:47:15,902
we talked about is we wanted them to be the heroes of their own story. And that's why

1196
00:47:15,902 --> 00:47:17,984
we spent so much time with Otto.

1197
00:47:18,925 --> 00:47:20,726
You know, you see him, obviously,

1198
00:47:20,726 --> 00:47:22,767
the first time you see him, a lot of Marvel fans will say,

1199
00:47:22,767 --> 00:47:24,547
hey, he's gonna become Doc Ock.

1200
00:47:24,547 --> 00:47:27,228
And then what we did was, we purposely

1201
00:47:27,228 --> 00:47:29,008
humanized him a lot to the point

1202
00:47:29,008 --> 00:47:30,829
where I wanted people to say, was he

1203
00:47:30,829 --> 00:47:33,330
gonna become the villain or not, almost like hoping he doesn't.

1204
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:34,850
And obviously he turns. So we spent

1205
00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:36,991
a lot of time, and then we realized,

1206
00:47:36,991 --> 00:47:38,851
how do we elevate the stakes? How do we

1207
00:47:38,851 --> 00:47:40,852
show a more mature Spider-Man who's been, a more

1208
00:47:40,852 --> 00:47:42,813
experienced Spider-Man who's been doing this for eight years,

1209
00:47:42,813 --> 00:47:44,633
let's give him his biggest threat ever, six villains

1210
00:47:44,633 --> 00:47:45,353
at the same time.

1211
00:47:45,814 --> 00:47:47,375
I would say the same thing on Mr. Negative.

1212
00:47:47,375 --> 00:47:50,337
We spent a lot of time, how do we humanize,

1213
00:47:50,337 --> 00:47:51,818
how do we make him much more relatable,

1214
00:47:51,818 --> 00:47:54,340
not just a mustache-trolling villain

1215
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:55,862
because he wants to destroy the city

1216
00:47:55,862 --> 00:47:57,523
for whatever reason, right?

1217
00:47:57,523 --> 00:47:59,785
So yeah, I think when you're working on something,

1218
00:47:59,785 --> 00:48:02,787
any game, if you can make your villain

1219
00:48:02,787 --> 00:48:04,789
as interesting as your hero, it's a win-win.

1220
00:48:07,861 --> 00:48:10,722
Awesome. Thanks for sharing your experiences. It's really cool to hear all that stuff.

1221
00:48:10,722 --> 00:48:13,543
Could you elaborate a little bit more on the game design or gameplay side,

1222
00:48:13,543 --> 00:48:16,203
like some thematic areas you tried to focus on or core pillars of design?

1223
00:48:16,203 --> 00:48:21,065
Sure. I mean, well, I think the first minute we knew we were making a Spider-Man game,

1224
00:48:21,065 --> 00:48:23,165
we had to say those webs better attach to buildings.

1225
00:48:23,165 --> 00:48:28,847
I mean, I think the thing is we wanted to make sure that we didn't want to make a hardcore game.

1226
00:48:28,847 --> 00:48:29,587
It was about...

1227
00:48:30,208 --> 00:48:33,290
Spider-Man, everybody, Spider-Man is such a well-known over the world.

1228
00:48:33,290 --> 00:48:35,270
We want to make the game as accessible as possible.

1229
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:40,012
Obviously, have a level of skill, but we beat in our brains over and over again, make this

1230
00:48:40,012 --> 00:48:42,053
game so everybody can feel like a hero.

1231
00:48:42,053 --> 00:48:45,054
And with more skill, they feel like a greater superhero over time.

1232
00:48:45,054 --> 00:48:49,876
So we really, from a combat traversal to our boss fights, we really want to keep that across

1233
00:48:49,876 --> 00:48:50,156
the board.

1234
00:48:50,156 --> 00:48:51,936
And then it's just, you know, balancing.

1235
00:48:52,715 --> 00:48:54,136
the superhero nature of the character,

1236
00:48:54,136 --> 00:48:56,478
but then also how can we make someone like Peter

1237
00:48:56,478 --> 00:48:58,260
or Miles or MJ playable?

1238
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:00,402
So again, not only thematically saying

1239
00:49:00,402 --> 00:49:01,583
we want to make a human story,

1240
00:49:01,583 --> 00:49:03,244
but also delivering that in gameplay as well.

1241
00:49:03,244 --> 00:49:06,047
So from Peter working at helping Aunt May a feast

1242
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:07,368
to actually working in the lab,

1243
00:49:07,368 --> 00:49:10,531
to being MJ in the Grand Central Terminal,

1244
00:49:10,531 --> 00:49:12,393
to Miles being chased down by Rhino,

1245
00:49:12,393 --> 00:49:14,415
we want to make sure all those elements were in there.

1246
00:49:14,415 --> 00:49:15,776
Awesome, thank you very much.

1247
00:49:15,776 --> 00:49:16,096
Welcome.

1248
00:49:18,652 --> 00:49:19,972
Thank you very much for the talk.

1249
00:49:19,972 --> 00:49:20,352
It was excellent.

1250
00:49:20,352 --> 00:49:20,752
Appreciate it.

1251
00:49:20,752 --> 00:49:21,112
Thank you.

1252
00:49:21,112 --> 00:49:22,112
So I'm curious.

1253
00:49:22,112 --> 00:49:25,533
You mentioned earlier some of the deliberate new stakes

1254
00:49:25,533 --> 00:49:28,034
that you put in the ground for this version of Spider-Man.

1255
00:49:28,034 --> 00:49:30,755
Aunt May running the homeless shelter,

1256
00:49:30,755 --> 00:49:32,435
and reporter Mary Jane, and so on.

1257
00:49:32,435 --> 00:49:35,256
Did you have challenges working with Marvel as the IP holders

1258
00:49:35,256 --> 00:49:36,476
making those changes?

1259
00:49:36,476 --> 00:49:38,496
So you just asked the second most question I've ever

1260
00:49:38,496 --> 00:49:39,497
gotten asked about Marvel.

1261
00:49:39,497 --> 00:49:41,177
No, I mean, actually.

1262
00:49:41,637 --> 00:49:43,359
That was the thing that probably surprised me,

1263
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:45,061
because probably a lot of people were thinking,

1264
00:49:45,061 --> 00:49:46,802
like, oh, they're the license holder.

1265
00:49:46,802 --> 00:49:48,845
They're going to put all these restrictions on us.

1266
00:49:48,845 --> 00:49:50,206
And they quite frankly didn't.

1267
00:49:50,206 --> 00:49:53,349
They were actually more pushing us to try new things

1268
00:49:53,349 --> 00:49:57,533
more than anything, because the worst thing I didn't want,

1269
00:49:57,533 --> 00:49:59,435
I think we all didn't want people to say, like, oh,

1270
00:49:59,435 --> 00:50:00,336
I read that story.

1271
00:50:00,336 --> 00:50:03,619
I've read that story already, or I've seen that in a movie.

1272
00:50:03,619 --> 00:50:05,241
So they were actually pushing us to.

1273
00:50:05,982 --> 00:50:07,623
to go try different things.

1274
00:50:07,623 --> 00:50:09,844
The thing we talked about a lot was

1275
00:50:09,844 --> 00:50:11,345
respect the DNA of the franchise,

1276
00:50:11,345 --> 00:50:13,807
but not be afraid to mix things up.

1277
00:50:13,807 --> 00:50:15,088
For example, you know what we,

1278
00:50:15,088 --> 00:50:15,948
if you played the end of the game,

1279
00:50:15,948 --> 00:50:19,030
you know what happens to a certain character, right?

1280
00:50:19,030 --> 00:50:20,471
That was a big deal, and I actually thought

1281
00:50:20,471 --> 00:50:22,793
there's no way in hell that they're gonna go for it.

1282
00:50:22,793 --> 00:50:25,134
And we actually went back and forth

1283
00:50:25,134 --> 00:50:27,716
about whether that person was gonna have that fate,

1284
00:50:27,716 --> 00:50:30,298
and I remember we went on holiday break.

1285
00:50:30,838 --> 00:50:32,059
and coming back.

1286
00:50:32,059 --> 00:50:34,501
So originally, that wasn't going to happen to her.

1287
00:50:34,501 --> 00:50:37,584
You guys probably all know what happens.

1288
00:50:37,584 --> 00:50:40,266
And so originally, she was going to be saved.

1289
00:50:40,266 --> 00:50:42,128
And then I came back, and I sat down

1290
00:50:42,128 --> 00:50:44,770
with Bill and Eric, our lead producer on Marvel.

1291
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:47,112
And I said, hey, I had some people who

1292
00:50:47,112 --> 00:50:48,533
are new to the studio play it.

1293
00:50:49,253 --> 00:50:50,194
they feel this way.

1294
00:50:50,194 --> 00:50:54,358
I haven't slept all vacation because I think that this needs to happen.

1295
00:50:54,358 --> 00:50:55,679
What do you guys think?

1296
00:50:55,679 --> 00:50:58,821
And they said, we're actually having the same thoughts over break.

1297
00:50:58,821 --> 00:50:59,482
Let's go for it.

1298
00:50:59,482 --> 00:51:02,184
And because they want to make sure, did we earn it?

1299
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:06,728
It was more about earning the things we wanted to do and having reasons for it rather than

1300
00:51:06,728 --> 00:51:08,649
just like, we didn't want anything to be out of shock value.

1301
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:12,471
So once they understood that and we were laying the track

1302
00:51:12,471 --> 00:51:13,772
for things that were gonna happen,

1303
00:51:13,772 --> 00:51:16,513
they were very comfortable with some of the risks

1304
00:51:16,513 --> 00:51:17,073
we wanted to take.

1305
00:51:17,073 --> 00:51:18,754
So they were great partners.

1306
00:51:18,754 --> 00:51:21,575
I also think for us it helped that they're only 15 minutes

1307
00:51:21,575 --> 00:51:22,736
down the road from our offices.

1308
00:51:22,736 --> 00:51:26,277
So like anytime we would go one or two more emails,

1309
00:51:26,277 --> 00:51:27,618
we're like, can you just come over?

1310
00:51:27,618 --> 00:51:29,839
And we would just come talk about it in person

1311
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:31,319
and we would solve it pretty quickly.

1312
00:51:31,319 --> 00:51:33,961
So they're great partners and we loved working with them.

1313
00:51:33,961 --> 00:51:34,201
Cool, thank you.

1314
00:51:34,201 --> 00:51:34,421
Thank you.

1315
00:51:36,892 --> 00:51:37,612
Question.

1316
00:51:37,612 --> 00:51:40,194
Yes, so you mentioned planning for unknowns

1317
00:51:40,194 --> 00:51:42,055
and keeping a set amount of time scheduled

1318
00:51:42,055 --> 00:51:43,476
for whatever you need it for.

1319
00:51:43,476 --> 00:51:45,697
Was there a point in production, like near the end,

1320
00:51:45,697 --> 00:51:48,059
when you're going, oh, that you found some unknown time

1321
00:51:48,059 --> 00:51:49,439
left over, and you're like, oh, can we

1322
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:51,141
start using this to add to the game?

1323
00:51:51,141 --> 00:51:53,062
Or how do you deal with that?

1324
00:51:53,062 --> 00:51:55,083
Because any developers want to make the game

1325
00:51:55,083 --> 00:51:56,404
as best as possible.

1326
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:58,225
How do you deal with, we have extra time,

1327
00:51:58,225 --> 00:51:59,686
but we can't use it.

1328
00:51:59,686 --> 00:51:59,806
So.

1329
00:52:01,907 --> 00:52:05,370
What I talked about is something I wish we did more of.

1330
00:52:05,370 --> 00:52:07,572
I don't think we planned enough for unknowns.

1331
00:52:07,572 --> 00:52:09,353
Like, I think that, and it's funny,

1332
00:52:09,353 --> 00:52:12,896
when I was a producer, I remember on Sunset Overdrive,

1333
00:52:12,896 --> 00:52:14,998
I actually had unknown blocks.

1334
00:52:14,998 --> 00:52:18,160
But what happens is, the game kind of just grows naturally,

1335
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,902
and you're like, I'll just start filling in

1336
00:52:19,902 --> 00:52:21,443
those, that unknown time.

1337
00:52:21,443 --> 00:52:23,965
And then what happens is you're filling in for scope

1338
00:52:23,965 --> 00:52:25,866
rather than filling in for things

1339
00:52:25,866 --> 00:52:27,688
that are actually gonna not work.

1340
00:52:27,688 --> 00:52:28,288
So I think that,

1341
00:52:29,686 --> 00:52:31,987
it's just this constant battle, not battle,

1342
00:52:31,987 --> 00:52:34,648
but it's conversation you have to have with your team

1343
00:52:34,648 --> 00:52:37,650
to say like, I know you want more,

1344
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:41,492
but you're gonna want rework rather than more.

1345
00:52:41,492 --> 00:52:43,313
And that's something like,

1346
00:52:43,313 --> 00:52:44,693
part of me putting in the presentation

1347
00:52:44,693 --> 00:52:47,015
was to like force myself to remember this going forward

1348
00:52:47,015 --> 00:52:50,616
of like, more doesn't always equal better.

1349
00:52:50,616 --> 00:52:54,278
Iteration and rework actually leads to a better experience.

1350
00:52:54,278 --> 00:52:55,519
So I just think it's something like.

1351
00:52:56,882 --> 00:53:00,783
you gotta do it before you can actually achieve it, I guess.

1352
00:53:00,783 --> 00:53:02,064
Like, you just gotta, you know,

1353
00:53:02,064 --> 00:53:04,245
I can imagine, like I mentioned Scott,

1354
00:53:04,245 --> 00:53:05,865
I could totally imagine me going,

1355
00:53:05,865 --> 00:53:07,966
you're crazy, just do it, do it,

1356
00:53:07,966 --> 00:53:09,466
just add it to that schedule.

1357
00:53:09,466 --> 00:53:11,427
I hope he pushes back on me going forward.

1358
00:53:11,427 --> 00:53:12,327
Thank you.

1359
00:53:12,327 --> 00:53:13,207
You're welcome.

1360
00:53:13,207 --> 00:53:13,908
Question.

1361
00:53:13,908 --> 00:53:17,209
Brian, thank you so much, just for working on the game.

1362
00:53:17,209 --> 00:53:19,789
You're a really cool dude, and I gotta say,

1363
00:53:19,789 --> 00:53:23,271
like, Spider-Man brought me to tears at the end of the game.

1364
00:53:23,271 --> 00:53:23,831
So my question is,

1365
00:53:24,763 --> 00:53:29,870
Your characters are all very emotional, and I was just wondering, do you in your studio

1366
00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:31,572
get just as emotional working on it?

1367
00:53:31,572 --> 00:53:33,134
I've cried in meetings.

1368
00:53:33,134 --> 00:53:36,058
Yeah, I definitely have teared up when I've seen certain scenes.

1369
00:53:36,058 --> 00:53:39,683
I've also probably cried to say, can we please do this?

1370
00:53:40,935 --> 00:53:43,057
But no, I mean, hopefully you guys can tell,

1371
00:53:43,057 --> 00:53:44,959
I'm pretty much an open book, and I wear my emotions

1372
00:53:44,959 --> 00:53:45,580
on my sleeve.

1373
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:50,144
And our goal was to make it a very emotional story.

1374
00:53:50,144 --> 00:53:51,926
Like, we wanted the highs of the humor,

1375
00:53:51,926 --> 00:53:55,049
but we also wanted that very relatable human story.

1376
00:53:55,049 --> 00:53:57,511
So us having moments where that were pretty.

1377
00:53:57,932 --> 00:53:59,032
tough to watch.

1378
00:53:59,032 --> 00:54:03,376
What I knew when some story themes were clicking

1379
00:54:03,376 --> 00:54:06,618
is like that final scene that you see in the game,

1380
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:09,160
one of our actors who was actually not in that scene,

1381
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:10,161
she actually ran off stage

1382
00:54:10,161 --> 00:54:12,202
because she couldn't watch the actual recap.

1383
00:54:12,202 --> 00:54:13,663
And I was like, all right, well,

1384
00:54:13,663 --> 00:54:15,064
we're doing something right here.

1385
00:54:15,064 --> 00:54:16,925
It's probably one of the reasons why I fought

1386
00:54:16,925 --> 00:54:18,066
to keep that scene.

1387
00:54:18,066 --> 00:54:22,429
But yeah, I mean, we're in a very collaborative studio,

1388
00:54:22,429 --> 00:54:23,790
we're a very emotional studio.

1389
00:54:23,790 --> 00:54:25,352
I think that's what you can see in our games.

1390
00:54:26,332 --> 00:54:29,660
I wouldn't want to go on this journey with any other people.

1391
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:32,246
What you see is Insomniac's version of Spider-Man

1392
00:54:32,246 --> 00:54:33,168
definitely thrown through.

1393
00:54:33,168 --> 00:54:33,669
That's awesome.

1394
00:54:33,669 --> 00:54:35,152
Thank you very much for everything.

1395
00:54:35,152 --> 00:54:35,954
Thanks for the question.

1396
00:54:38,011 --> 00:54:43,815
Hi, you somewhat referred to this a little bit earlier in your talk, but I wanted to

1397
00:54:43,815 --> 00:54:49,698
ask about when you're working on a product that is something that you have a lot of experience

1398
00:54:49,698 --> 00:54:54,742
within your past, you're super passionate about, and not just you, but literally everybody

1399
00:54:54,742 --> 00:54:56,943
on the team is the same way.

1400
00:54:56,943 --> 00:54:57,904
How do you help...

1401
00:54:59,044 --> 00:55:02,890
focus that energy to stop people from going off in many different directions

1402
00:55:02,890 --> 00:55:07,357
because everybody has super excited and wants to contribute their own ideas and

1403
00:55:07,357 --> 00:55:12,083
things but it can easily get out of hand. How do you help focus that in a

1404
00:55:12,083 --> 00:55:12,885
productive way?

1405
00:55:12,885 --> 00:55:13,706
I think two ways.

1406
00:55:13,806 --> 00:55:15,247
One is the pillars of your game.

1407
00:55:15,247 --> 00:55:17,648
Establish the pillars of the game really early.

1408
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:20,149
Like, we talked a lot about this game being a grown-up

1409
00:55:20,149 --> 00:55:22,431
Peter Parker, so a 23-year-old, more experienced

1410
00:55:22,431 --> 00:55:24,512
Spider-Man, this idea of a human story.

1411
00:55:24,512 --> 00:55:27,393
We talked about a superior Spider-Man.

1412
00:55:27,393 --> 00:55:30,095
We're really leveraging the idea of acrobatic

1413
00:55:30,095 --> 00:55:33,617
improvisation, the swinging being very accessible.

1414
00:55:33,617 --> 00:55:37,739
When people start to fan out and come up, bring it back to

1415
00:55:37,739 --> 00:55:38,580
the pillars.

1416
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:40,461
If it's supporting the pillars, go for it.

1417
00:55:41,174 --> 00:55:42,576
The other thing, again, is mentioning

1418
00:55:42,576 --> 00:55:43,758
the DNA of the character.

1419
00:55:43,758 --> 00:55:47,184
Once you define that DNA of the character.

1420
00:55:48,245 --> 00:55:50,106
Like you said, if it's someone like Spider-Man who's,

1421
00:55:50,106 --> 00:55:51,567
like you said, so many different ways

1422
00:55:51,567 --> 00:55:53,268
you can come to this character,

1423
00:55:53,268 --> 00:55:56,550
bring it back to across any medium,

1424
00:55:56,550 --> 00:55:58,312
are those attributes still there?

1425
00:55:58,312 --> 00:55:59,592
And if they don't, just say, hey, no,

1426
00:55:59,592 --> 00:56:01,514
this isn't the DNA of the character we're talking about.

1427
00:56:01,514 --> 00:56:03,075
I know you're passionate about it,

1428
00:56:03,075 --> 00:56:04,956
but this is the way that we're thinking about it.

1429
00:56:04,956 --> 00:56:07,758
It's a really fine line because you want,

1430
00:56:07,758 --> 00:56:09,139
you don't wanna discourage somebody, right,

1431
00:56:09,139 --> 00:56:10,520
from coming up with a great idea.

1432
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:12,221
But just my advice is bring it back

1433
00:56:12,221 --> 00:56:13,402
to the pillars of the game,

1434
00:56:13,402 --> 00:56:14,923
bring it back to the DNA of the character,

1435
00:56:14,923 --> 00:56:16,444
and more often than not, I think the,

1436
00:56:16,544 --> 00:56:18,847
the conversation will go in a positive direction.

1437
00:56:18,847 --> 00:56:21,209
But, you know, it's one of those things,

1438
00:56:21,209 --> 00:56:22,911
it's a struggle, like I said,

1439
00:56:22,911 --> 00:56:25,835
it's the Spider-Man or the character they have in their head,

1440
00:56:25,835 --> 00:56:27,617
it's hard to,

1441
00:56:27,617 --> 00:56:28,878
you don't want to upset that,

1442
00:56:28,878 --> 00:56:30,900
so I think you go back to those pillars in the DNA

1443
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:31,941
and you'll be in good shape.

1444
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:34,721
All right, I have one follow-up question.

1445
00:56:34,721 --> 00:56:35,382
Sure.

1446
00:56:35,382 --> 00:56:40,625
How do you get people aligned behind those pillars and that DNA that you've established?

1447
00:56:40,625 --> 00:56:41,586
Because you know...

1448
00:56:41,586 --> 00:56:45,188
You stand in front of a microphone and you go, this is the way we're making it.

1449
00:56:45,188 --> 00:56:51,392
No, I mean, I think if they see how passionate you are and they understand that you believe

1450
00:56:51,392 --> 00:56:55,635
in the character and you're passionate about doing it right, that they will follow.

1451
00:56:55,635 --> 00:56:56,796
And then also, like I said...

1452
00:56:57,867 --> 00:57:01,088
Handing, because when I pitched the game originally,

1453
00:57:01,088 --> 00:57:02,688
there are so many things I didn't know

1454
00:57:02,688 --> 00:57:03,708
what was gonna happen.

1455
00:57:03,708 --> 00:57:05,769
So making them invested in coming up

1456
00:57:05,769 --> 00:57:06,609
with how we can solve it,

1457
00:57:06,609 --> 00:57:07,570
how we can bring this character to life

1458
00:57:07,570 --> 00:57:09,930
through the story, through the missions,

1459
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:10,631
through the world.

1460
00:57:10,631 --> 00:57:12,671
Once you give them ownership of it,

1461
00:57:12,671 --> 00:57:16,572
they're much more invested to be part of that team.

1462
00:57:16,572 --> 00:57:18,353
So I just get, bring them into the fold

1463
00:57:18,353 --> 00:57:19,833
as much as possible to solve those problems

1464
00:57:19,833 --> 00:57:21,494
that you will eventually face.

1465
00:57:21,494 --> 00:57:21,994
Thank you.

1466
00:57:23,203 --> 00:57:28,385
Hi, so you've talked about creative and character pillars a lot and how it's really important

1467
00:57:28,385 --> 00:57:32,547
to stick to them and evangelize them throughout the project.

1468
00:57:32,547 --> 00:57:36,688
Were there any pillars that you had to make major pivots on or change or abandon as you

1469
00:57:36,688 --> 00:57:37,228
went through?

1470
00:57:37,228 --> 00:57:42,270
Yeah, I think one of the pillars at the end of the game, at the beginning was, I think

1471
00:57:42,390 --> 00:57:43,731
a city with a mind of its own.

1472
00:57:43,731 --> 00:57:46,672
We wanted to push more of some of the world systems

1473
00:57:46,672 --> 00:57:48,753
that we had, and we just, at the end of the day,

1474
00:57:48,753 --> 00:57:51,455
had to make choice on priorities and scope.

1475
00:57:51,455 --> 00:57:55,297
And we knew right away that we wanted to make a superhero

1476
00:57:55,297 --> 00:57:57,838
that felt really good from a combat traversal standpoint.

1477
00:57:57,838 --> 00:58:00,679
We wanted this very human story.

1478
00:58:00,679 --> 00:58:02,540
We just said, hey, this is where we're gonna put

1479
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:05,882
our emphasis right now, and some of the world elements

1480
00:58:05,882 --> 00:58:07,603
may not be part of that original vision.

1481
00:58:07,603 --> 00:58:09,504
So we still put a lot of time, and I'm really proud

1482
00:58:09,504 --> 00:58:10,985
of the things we did put in our world.

1483
00:58:11,385 --> 00:58:15,991
But we probably didn't achieve the first thought I had in my head.

1484
00:58:15,991 --> 00:58:17,633
Maybe I was over scoping from the start.

1485
00:58:17,633 --> 00:58:19,956
So that's probably where we had to make some,

1486
00:58:19,956 --> 00:58:23,701
I mean, I mentioned the idea about features and priorities.

1487
00:58:23,701 --> 00:58:25,503
That's one of the choices we had to make.

1488
00:58:25,503 --> 00:58:26,064
Thanks.

1489
00:58:26,064 --> 00:58:26,204
Yeah.

1490
00:58:26,204 --> 00:58:27,706
We're there.

1491
00:58:28,979 --> 00:58:30,420
Hey you, I saw you yesterday.

1492
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:31,961
Well, hello, good to see you again.

1493
00:58:31,961 --> 00:58:34,623
Thanks so much for doing this talk.

1494
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:37,025
But one thing that really stood out to me about everything

1495
00:58:37,025 --> 00:58:39,206
you just said that I thought was really interesting

1496
00:58:39,206 --> 00:58:41,408
is you talked a lot about your personal journey,

1497
00:58:41,408 --> 00:58:43,970
kind of as you were, as a first-time creative director,

1498
00:58:43,970 --> 00:58:46,211
going through this process.

1499
00:58:46,211 --> 00:58:47,812
And you mentioned a lot of things

1500
00:58:47,812 --> 00:58:51,515
that you had to learn and things that you're currently learning.

1501
00:58:52,315 --> 00:58:54,897
So based on that, as someone who's a writer and producer,

1502
00:58:54,897 --> 00:58:56,677
and also trying to make sure I learn things

1503
00:58:56,677 --> 00:58:59,919
and hold myself to account to improve,

1504
00:58:59,919 --> 00:59:01,359
do you have any particular strategies in your head

1505
00:59:01,359 --> 00:59:02,460
that you go to when you're like,

1506
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:03,760
well, I want to make sure I keep doing this,

1507
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:06,982
so this is what I should do to hold myself accountable?

1508
00:59:06,982 --> 00:59:09,823
Actually, sometimes I lean on other people,

1509
00:59:09,823 --> 00:59:13,104
like other people on my team actually remind me,

1510
00:59:13,104 --> 00:59:15,966
like Ryan Smith, he's the game director that I work with,

1511
00:59:15,966 --> 00:59:18,107
he will, sometimes I'll get in the habit of like,

1512
00:59:18,107 --> 00:59:19,467
oh, I'm gonna go solve this, and he's like,

1513
00:59:19,467 --> 00:59:20,408
no, what if we do the brainstorm?

1514
00:59:21,186 --> 00:59:23,527
And I'm like, oh yeah, let's get the team together.

1515
00:59:23,527 --> 00:59:25,789
And then I just did that last week.

1516
00:59:25,789 --> 00:59:27,009
And it totally worked.

1517
00:59:27,009 --> 00:59:29,551
And what came out of that brainstorm

1518
00:59:29,551 --> 00:59:31,132
totally helped on something we're working on.

1519
00:59:31,132 --> 00:59:34,233
So again, I think it's sometimes asking other people to say,

1520
00:59:34,233 --> 00:59:37,875
hey, if I start doing this, remind me that I'm screwing up

1521
00:59:37,875 --> 00:59:39,176
and get me back on track.

1522
00:59:39,176 --> 00:59:40,557
So that's what I started doing.

1523
00:59:40,557 --> 00:59:40,777
Thank you.

1524
00:59:43,151 --> 00:59:43,552
Oh, we're done?

1525
00:59:43,552 --> 00:59:44,414
Good to see you again.

1526
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:45,717
All right.

1527
00:59:45,717 --> 00:59:46,559
Oh, I can, I can, I can ask,

1528
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:47,802
you can ask the question after, for sure.

1529
00:59:47,802 --> 00:59:49,867
All right, well thank you everyone.

1530
00:59:49,867 --> 00:59:50,909
Thank you so much for attending.
