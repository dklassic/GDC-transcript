1
00:00:05,867 --> 00:00:06,468
Hey, everybody.

2
00:00:07,048 --> 00:00:09,029
You all having a good GDC thus far?

3
00:00:11,251 --> 00:00:11,511
Awesome.

4
00:00:11,531 --> 00:00:13,332
Thank you ever so much for sticking around to the end

5
00:00:13,372 --> 00:00:15,854
to see my little presentation.

6
00:00:15,894 --> 00:00:16,975
That's super good of you.

7
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:20,837
I've been authorized by the event coordinators

8
00:00:20,857 --> 00:00:23,559
to warn you that they've given me this laser device

9
00:00:23,639 --> 00:00:25,701
to blind anyone whose mobile phone goes off.

10
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:28,262
So if you could please turn your phones off.

11
00:00:29,383 --> 00:00:33,544
Also, you'll probably be receiving an email requesting feedback on this presentation.

12
00:00:34,864 --> 00:00:38,345
Please feel free to fill that in. I'd love to hear what you think.

13
00:00:39,145 --> 00:00:41,066
Unless you think it's bad, in which case I wouldn't.

14
00:00:42,006 --> 00:00:49,728
And so with that out of the way, I shall begin my presentation.

15
00:00:51,548 --> 00:00:54,209
So for those of you who don't know me, I'm Dan Taylor.

16
00:00:55,067 --> 00:01:00,072
I've been in the video game industry in various capacities for over 15 years now.

17
00:01:01,513 --> 00:01:06,737
And I've had the awesome privilege to work at great studios like Sony Computer Entertainment

18
00:01:06,877 --> 00:01:12,602
Europe, Electronic Arts in Vancouver, Rockstar, and Ubisoft.

19
00:01:13,983 --> 00:01:21,430
And I'm currently working as a senior level designer for Square Enix at their studio in

20
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:22,671
Montreal.

21
00:01:24,491 --> 00:01:26,892
which is a place that's famous for lumberjacks, poutine,

22
00:01:27,312 --> 00:01:29,753
and this lady, Celine Dion, who I think is the mayor

23
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:31,194
or the queen of Montreal or something.

24
00:01:32,135 --> 00:01:36,517
It's also where the new Hitman is being made.

25
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:39,498
And I've been tasked with running the level design on that,

26
00:01:39,538 --> 00:01:41,379
which is super, super exciting.

27
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,720
And when I found out I was working on

28
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,801
such a revered franchise,

29
00:01:47,662 --> 00:01:51,083
I was reminded of the graphic novelist, Paul Pope.

30
00:01:52,122 --> 00:01:56,765
And what he said when he was given carte blanche to do whatever he wanted with Batman.

31
00:01:57,685 --> 00:02:02,467
He said that working on such a cool franchise was like being handed the keys to an extremely

32
00:02:02,527 --> 00:02:03,168
hot car.

33
00:02:03,808 --> 00:02:08,530
Now, you can either drive it very carefully, make sure you don't scratch the paint, or

34
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,932
you can take it out onto the highway and open it up and see what it can do.

35
00:02:13,165 --> 00:02:16,067
And I figured that if I was going to take Hitman out onto the highway,

36
00:02:16,087 --> 00:02:19,069
it would be good if I had some kind of map, so I didn't get lost,

37
00:02:19,249 --> 00:02:20,130
and I knew where I was going.

38
00:02:21,851 --> 00:02:23,552
And it just so happened that before I landed at Square,

39
00:02:24,032 --> 00:02:27,555
I was putting together a series of best practices for next-gen level design,

40
00:02:29,937 --> 00:02:30,837
which was kind of helpful.

41
00:02:31,438 --> 00:02:34,960
And I found myself looking to classic design principles for inspiration,

42
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,162
as I often do in situations like this.

43
00:02:38,106 --> 00:02:40,088
particularly the work of this guy, Dieter Rams.

44
00:02:40,728 --> 00:02:42,189
So for those of you who don't know Dieter Rams,

45
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:45,672
he was the chief design officer at Brown in Germany

46
00:02:45,893 --> 00:02:47,014
for over 30 years.

47
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,857
His product design has been a major influence

48
00:02:51,617 --> 00:02:52,919
on people like Jonathan Ive,

49
00:02:52,999 --> 00:02:54,440
who does all the product design for Apple.

50
00:02:55,561 --> 00:02:59,584
And in the 1970s, he published a paper called

51
00:03:00,285 --> 00:03:01,546
10 Principles of Good Design.

52
00:03:02,066 --> 00:03:04,048
So good design is honest.

53
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:06,110
Good design is aesthetic.

54
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,781
good design is as little design as possible, and so on and so forth.

55
00:03:12,722 --> 00:03:16,083
And whilst this works well for minimalist product design,

56
00:03:17,243 --> 00:03:19,404
it's not really applicable to game design or level design.

57
00:03:20,124 --> 00:03:24,445
But I thought it might be possible to do a similar set of guidelines for level design.

58
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,666
So I started to put them together.

59
00:03:28,988 --> 00:03:31,629
Before I get going, I'm going to make a quick apology.

60
00:03:31,649 --> 00:03:35,150
There's going to be a lot of interdisciplinary crossover in these principles.

61
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,330
So it's more than just level design.

62
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,131
It's mission design.

63
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:39,691
It's narrative design.

64
00:03:39,711 --> 00:03:40,652
It's mechanic design.

65
00:03:41,772 --> 00:03:45,753
And I think this is important because a good level designer should really be well versed

66
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:50,234
in all of these fields so they can take a holistic approach to the design of their levels.

67
00:03:52,755 --> 00:03:56,737
Also, despite Charlton Heston dressed as Moses.

68
00:03:59,055 --> 00:04:02,577
in these slides. These are not rules that are written in stone.

69
00:04:02,857 --> 00:04:06,599
They're just guiding principles. They're my undereducated opinion.

70
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:11,382
They've been created to prompt discussion, to shed a little bit of light

71
00:04:11,422 --> 00:04:14,884
on the black art of level design, and hopefully help some people create

72
00:04:14,904 --> 00:04:18,946
some kick-ass levels along the way. So now we've got that out of the way,

73
00:04:18,966 --> 00:04:22,128
let's start with the first principle, which is

74
00:04:22,948 --> 00:04:26,170
that good level design is fun to navigate.

75
00:04:27,287 --> 00:04:31,092
Now just traversing a level presents the player with many different gameplay vectors.

76
00:04:32,053 --> 00:04:36,078
There's observational, which is the act of surveying one's surroundings.

77
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:41,145
Strategic, the act of processing your observations into a plan.

78
00:04:41,806 --> 00:04:45,390
And then there's navigational, the act of actually traversing the level itself.

79
00:04:48,935 --> 00:04:50,816
And for a smooth and enjoyable experience,

80
00:04:51,637 --> 00:04:54,159
the player should always know exactly where to go,

81
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,121
which is why it's important to develop

82
00:04:56,581 --> 00:05:00,084
a consistent visual language that clearly guides the player

83
00:05:00,445 --> 00:05:01,506
through the critical path.

84
00:05:02,486 --> 00:05:04,288
Now, different games use different methods to do this.

85
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:08,612
But it usually comes down to the use of light, geometry, color,

86
00:05:08,952 --> 00:05:13,696
and animation, a good example of which is Mirror's Edge.

87
00:05:14,726 --> 00:05:18,149
So Mirror's Edge uses all of these things to create fantastic clarity and flow.

88
00:05:19,331 --> 00:05:22,053
If you look at this slide, it's pretty easy to work out.

89
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:27,539
You have to climb up the red crane, run along the red crane, jump onto the red pipes, run

90
00:05:27,579 --> 00:05:31,222
along the red pipes, and then jump onto the conveniently placed soft squishy object just

91
00:05:31,282 --> 00:05:31,683
on the right.

92
00:05:33,883 --> 00:05:35,184
But the important thing to note here

93
00:05:35,904 --> 00:05:38,065
is the difference between intuitive to navigate

94
00:05:38,745 --> 00:05:39,745
and fun to navigate.

95
00:05:40,405 --> 00:05:42,066
What the player doesn't notice in the screenshot

96
00:05:42,106 --> 00:05:42,966
is equally important.

97
00:05:43,466 --> 00:05:47,547
So the hidden messenger bags, the speed paths

98
00:05:47,567 --> 00:05:49,948
that will give you achievements, and all of these

99
00:05:49,988 --> 00:05:52,309
are put in there to encourage exploration, which is

100
00:05:52,369 --> 00:05:54,489
essentially freestyle navigation.

101
00:05:55,069 --> 00:05:57,790
And this helps create depth and replayability in your levels.

102
00:05:59,411 --> 00:06:00,711
Also in contrast to this point.

103
00:06:02,249 --> 00:06:04,370
sometimes it's good to throw in a little confusion.

104
00:06:05,751 --> 00:06:05,951
Now,

105
00:06:07,112 --> 00:06:10,434
Modern Warfare 2 does this particularly well in its favela level.

106
00:06:11,374 --> 00:06:13,715
It's highly memorable for its hectic and intense gameplay.

107
00:06:14,496 --> 00:06:16,077
You're set

108
00:06:16,317 --> 00:06:19,779
in a Brazilian favela. It's a tight, twisty maze. There's no clearly

109
00:06:19,859 --> 00:06:20,759
obvious path through it.

110
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:23,401
Enemies are coming from all sides. They're coming from behind.

111
00:06:24,061 --> 00:06:27,163
They bring versatility into the level design with enemies attacking you from above.

112
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:30,264
Is it easy to navigate through this level? Absolutely not.

113
00:06:31,352 --> 00:06:33,153
Is it fun? Yes it is.

114
00:06:34,593 --> 00:06:37,934
And by carefully throwing in some well-considered confusion to the mix,

115
00:06:38,394 --> 00:06:41,555
Treyarch have created a really good sense of dramatic tension in this level.

116
00:06:42,996 --> 00:06:43,796
And speaking of drama,

117
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:50,538
the second principle is that good level design does not rely on words to tell the story.

118
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,921
One of my mentors once told me that a good story or a good piece of communication

119
00:07:00,822 --> 00:07:02,023
is like a broken circle.

120
00:07:03,004 --> 00:07:04,285
And you give the player this circle

121
00:07:04,765 --> 00:07:07,267
and it's down to them to fill in the gap.

122
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:09,249
Now the trick here

123
00:07:09,969 --> 00:07:11,810
is if you make the gap too big

124
00:07:12,671 --> 00:07:13,892
the player won't be able to fill it in

125
00:07:14,452 --> 00:07:16,514
and he'll feel confused and patronized.

126
00:07:17,274 --> 00:07:19,016
But if you make the gap too small

127
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,558
he'll fill it in too easily and he'll be bored and he won't feel challenged.

128
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:25,721
So, how do we do this in terms of level design?

129
00:07:26,915 --> 00:07:30,857
Well, there are three types of narrative at work in a game's level.

130
00:07:31,558 --> 00:07:34,819
There's explicit, implicit, and emergent.

131
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,862
Explicit narrative is anything that's explicitly called out to the player

132
00:07:41,282 --> 00:07:45,184
through cutscenes or text or spoken dialogue

133
00:07:45,284 --> 00:07:49,966
or any written content that he or she finds.

134
00:07:51,187 --> 00:07:53,068
And it's this that creates your circle.

135
00:07:54,687 --> 00:07:58,949
Implicit is anything that the player figures out for themselves by looking at the environment.

136
00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:00,810
I'll go into this in a bit more detail in a second.

137
00:08:02,031 --> 00:08:06,433
And emergent is the story that the player makes up in his or her own head.

138
00:08:07,414 --> 00:08:11,256
Now creating the first type of narrative is pretty straightforward, but it's the other

139
00:08:11,296 --> 00:08:17,239
two types, implicit and emergent, that create that crucial gap in the circle.

140
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:18,520
So how do we do this in a level?

141
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,460
So how do we do this in a level?

142
00:08:20,865 --> 00:08:25,907
Well, the best way of creating implicit narrative is a technique called mise-en-scene,

143
00:08:26,987 --> 00:08:31,629
which has been used by stage and cinema for many, many years.

144
00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:33,990
And it's the art of telling the story through the environment.

145
00:08:34,471 --> 00:08:37,732
And I believe that some studios call this environmental narrative.

146
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:42,602
So, for me, the master of implicit narrative is Bioshock.

147
00:08:43,283 --> 00:08:48,047
So if you look at these pictures here, you'll see there's water on the floor, which is kind of bad if you're in an underwater city.

148
00:08:48,748 --> 00:08:51,911
There are balloons on the ceiling, which means there was a party recently.

149
00:08:53,652 --> 00:08:57,296
There are creepy masks, which make you think, what kind of party was this?

150
00:08:58,236 --> 00:08:59,898
And there are drinks that have been left abandoned.

151
00:08:59,918 --> 00:09:03,041
So, clearly something went wrong, and people left in a hurry.

152
00:09:03,832 --> 00:09:07,872
What I find particularly interesting about this picture is the massive big sign on the side,

153
00:09:07,933 --> 00:09:10,153
which clearly says that it's New Year 1959,

154
00:09:10,193 --> 00:09:14,954
which tells you the exact date that everything went wrong.

155
00:09:15,294 --> 00:09:20,535
But also, even though it's almost the 60s, the decor of this environment is very much in the 40s,

156
00:09:20,575 --> 00:09:25,617
which creates an odd visual disparity and makes the player feel uneasy.

157
00:09:27,507 --> 00:09:29,629
Now it's very important that you should design your levels

158
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:32,271
to give your world artists the opportunity

159
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:33,532
to tell this visual story.

160
00:09:34,432 --> 00:09:38,215
But creating emergent narrative is not such an obvious task,

161
00:09:38,275 --> 00:09:40,157
because the level designer doesn't actually create it.

162
00:09:40,657 --> 00:09:44,340
He merely enables it by providing

163
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,661
the player with choice.

164
00:09:46,361 --> 00:09:49,424
So Hitman is actually a great example of emergent narrative,

165
00:09:50,124 --> 00:09:51,145
as there's plenty of choice.

166
00:09:51,285 --> 00:09:54,187
So you can use any kind of game mechanic

167
00:09:54,207 --> 00:09:56,429
you like to kill your mark.

168
00:09:56,839 --> 00:09:59,522
You can poison him with a syringe, or you can poison their food.

169
00:10:00,022 --> 00:10:01,484
You can use combat mechanics, either

170
00:10:02,024 --> 00:10:03,886
uh, garrotting him with a fiber wire,

171
00:10:03,906 --> 00:10:06,589
uh, or filling him full of bullets.

172
00:10:07,069 --> 00:10:08,531
You can even use the physics to kill him,

173
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:10,673
uh, by pushing him off a ledge,

174
00:10:11,213 --> 00:10:12,615
or by pushing something heavy onto him.

175
00:10:13,562 --> 00:10:16,743
And this is freedom of choice, an emergent style

176
00:10:17,303 --> 00:10:20,184
that's great for allowing the player to fill in the gap in your circle.

177
00:10:20,204 --> 00:10:24,005
In fact, in Hitman, you can even go in dressed as a chicken, guns blazing,

178
00:10:24,965 --> 00:10:26,605
and kill absolutely everyone in the entire level.

179
00:10:27,246 --> 00:10:29,606
Or you can sneak through the level undetected,

180
00:10:29,706 --> 00:10:31,006
dress in your immaculate black suit,

181
00:10:31,747 --> 00:10:33,727
kill only the mark, and leave through the front door

182
00:10:33,747 --> 00:10:34,827
before anyone knows you're there,

183
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:37,048
getting that perfect silent assassin rating,

184
00:10:37,988 --> 00:10:38,508
which is great.

185
00:10:39,408 --> 00:10:41,129
But too much choice.

186
00:10:41,966 --> 00:10:44,927
can leave the player confused and in need of guidance.

187
00:10:45,847 --> 00:10:50,329
Which is why the third principle is that good level design

188
00:10:51,229 --> 00:10:55,470
always tells the player what to do, but never how to do it.

189
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:01,292
The player needs to be in no doubt as to what he or she has to do

190
00:11:01,332 --> 00:11:02,192
when they go through your level.

191
00:11:03,353 --> 00:11:05,574
And you should provide them with clear objectives,

192
00:11:05,594 --> 00:11:08,214
so waypoints, other navigational aids, etc.

193
00:11:09,512 --> 00:11:14,935
But it is possible to create compelling challenge through obfuscation of the details.

194
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:19,057
That is to say by providing nebulous objectives.

195
00:11:20,118 --> 00:11:22,219
So keep your guidance concise and clear.

196
00:11:22,739 --> 00:11:27,521
Only give as much information to the players as is absolutely necessary.

197
00:11:28,142 --> 00:11:31,343
But make sure you provide multiple paths and styles of approach.

198
00:11:32,537 --> 00:11:35,741
So Skyrim does this very well because of its open world nature,

199
00:11:35,801 --> 00:11:37,143
particularly the Dark Brotherhood missions,

200
00:11:37,183 --> 00:11:39,686
which are kind of like a Tolkien-esque hitman.

201
00:11:42,049 --> 00:11:44,292
They tell you exactly where you can find your mark

202
00:11:44,332 --> 00:11:45,193
and exactly who they are.

203
00:11:45,534 --> 00:11:47,576
They even appear as a mark on your compass.

204
00:11:48,535 --> 00:11:52,358
but it never forces a player to use a singular technique to carry out the execution.

205
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:55,120
In fact, if you look at the level design for the Dark Brotherhood missions,

206
00:11:56,061 --> 00:12:00,304
very often specific alternate methods of execution have been set up.

207
00:12:00,644 --> 00:12:06,389
So there'll be an arrow, a bow rather, and a sheath of arrows on top of a ledge

208
00:12:06,429 --> 00:12:07,570
so you can strike from a distance.

209
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:11,913
Or there'll be an opportunity to kill the target silently

210
00:12:12,253 --> 00:12:15,156
when they leave the crowd and go to a secluded spot.

211
00:12:16,411 --> 00:12:21,173
So as well as not forcing the player what to do, it's important not to punish the player for improvisation.

212
00:12:21,814 --> 00:12:27,637
If the player does something that you don't expect, you shouldn't chastise them.

213
00:12:27,797 --> 00:12:32,679
You should design it into your game and encourage player improvisation.

214
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,742
And all this ties in with the emergent narrative that I was talking about earlier.

215
00:12:40,614 --> 00:12:42,896
So veteran game designer, Mark Cerny,

216
00:12:43,076 --> 00:12:45,258
tells us that the player should be presented

217
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:47,820
with concurrent objectives that can be completed

218
00:12:48,221 --> 00:12:49,842
in any order he or she wishes.

219
00:12:51,163 --> 00:12:53,925
Furthermore, on completion of one of those objectives,

220
00:12:53,945 --> 00:12:55,206
the player should receive a reward,

221
00:12:56,087 --> 00:12:58,209
which either makes the other objectives easier

222
00:12:58,349 --> 00:13:01,532
or modifies them in some way.

223
00:13:01,592 --> 00:13:04,995
And you can see this at work in Ratchet & Clank,

224
00:13:05,755 --> 00:13:07,016
on which Cerny consulted.

225
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:10,965
whereby if you complete the first planet,

226
00:13:11,425 --> 00:13:13,106
three or four planets become opened up to you.

227
00:13:14,707 --> 00:13:16,429
And you can complete them in any way that you like.

228
00:13:17,209 --> 00:13:18,430
Once you've completed one of the planets,

229
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:21,292
you get a new cool gadget or a weapon

230
00:13:22,353 --> 00:13:25,094
that lets you open up new and alternate paths

231
00:13:25,575 --> 00:13:27,576
on the other planets.

232
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:29,357
And it's this constant flow of gadgets

233
00:13:29,777 --> 00:13:33,100
that keeps the player engaged as he learns to use them.

234
00:13:34,561 --> 00:13:36,642
Which is why good level design

235
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:39,844
constantly teaches the player something new.

236
00:13:40,245 --> 00:13:42,325
Now previously, when I rehearsed this presentation,

237
00:13:42,385 --> 00:13:44,625
this is the spot where I do my Yoda impersonation

238
00:13:44,685 --> 00:13:45,626
to keep everyone awake.

239
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:49,146
But it always goes down like an absolute lead balloon,

240
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:50,627
so I'm gonna spare you my bad Yoda.

241
00:13:51,587 --> 00:13:53,387
And instead, I'm gonna tell you about a book

242
00:13:53,487 --> 00:13:56,628
called The Theory of Fun by Rafe Koster.

243
00:13:59,448 --> 00:14:03,089
In this book, Rafe Koster says that the human mind

244
00:14:03,669 --> 00:14:05,270
enjoys processing patterns.

245
00:14:06,282 --> 00:14:07,785
for storage and retrieval later.

246
00:14:08,366 --> 00:14:11,531
A lot of the fun in playing games is derived from this pattern analysis.

247
00:14:12,693 --> 00:14:14,857
If this pattern analysis ends too soon,

248
00:14:14,877 --> 00:14:18,162
this processing stops and the enjoyment ends.

249
00:14:19,887 --> 00:14:22,449
So how do we prolong this enjoyment through good level design?

250
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:28,113
Well, each level in your game should introduce, showcase, or subvert a key mechanic.

251
00:14:28,774 --> 00:14:32,757
Now again, holistic design of all of the levels in your game is important for this to work

252
00:14:32,817 --> 00:14:35,159
because you have to pace it out throughout the entire game.

253
00:14:36,119 --> 00:14:40,883
The best example of this constant teaching is any game in the Zelda series.

254
00:14:42,524 --> 00:14:46,247
So when you get into a new dungeon in any Zelda game...

255
00:14:47,038 --> 00:14:48,299
you pick up a new piece of equipment.

256
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:50,660
And each room in the dungeon

257
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,901
teaches you a different way to use that piece of equipment.

258
00:14:55,281 --> 00:14:56,782
Then the final boss in that dungeon

259
00:14:57,462 --> 00:14:59,122
tests your mastery of the piece of equipment

260
00:14:59,382 --> 00:15:00,983
before it even lets you out of the dungeon.

261
00:15:02,643 --> 00:15:04,884
On top of that, when you get out into the open world,

262
00:15:05,464 --> 00:15:08,165
you're constantly asked to learn new ways

263
00:15:08,205 --> 00:15:10,346
of using your equipment to access hidden areas

264
00:15:10,466 --> 00:15:11,966
and find all of those heart containers

265
00:15:12,007 --> 00:15:13,987
and large rupee chests and so on and so forth.

266
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:16,570
But it doesn't stop there.

267
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:20,953
Even the game's final boss usually requires the player

268
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:25,357
to use every single bit of equipment in an unusual way.

269
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:29,180
And this is quite similar to the loop

270
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:33,504
that Bethesda used to paste their games, which is learn,

271
00:15:34,104 --> 00:15:36,586
play, challenge, surprise.

272
00:15:37,667 --> 00:15:42,151
They'll teach the mechanics of the player explicitly.

273
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,271
Then they'll provide a safe area with no threats,

274
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,833
and all the toys that the player needs to kind of muck around

275
00:15:48,873 --> 00:15:49,673
and play with the mechanic.

276
00:15:50,974 --> 00:15:53,835
Then they'll bring in some threat or a compelling objective

277
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,897
to challenge the player's mastery of that mechanic.

278
00:15:57,797 --> 00:15:59,438
And then just when the player is feeling comfortable,

279
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,379
they'll do something crazy to surprise him.

280
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,562
And this is why the next principle

281
00:16:08,862 --> 00:16:11,543
is that good level design is surprising.

282
00:16:18,076 --> 00:16:21,777
Now this may seem pretty obvious, but a lot of designers forget about this.

283
00:16:21,997 --> 00:16:26,159
And by surprising I don't mean that you should just fill your level with loads of monsters

284
00:16:26,179 --> 00:16:27,039
jumping out of closets.

285
00:16:28,099 --> 00:16:31,440
What I'm trying to say is that you need to keep everything fresh by not falling into

286
00:16:31,481 --> 00:16:31,981
a routine.

287
00:16:32,001 --> 00:16:38,383
Now I'm sure all of you are super familiar with the classic rollercoaster pacing method

288
00:16:38,403 --> 00:16:41,164
which is used to pace pretty much everything in video games.

289
00:16:41,644 --> 00:16:46,145
So you have steadily increasing crescendos of intensity.

290
00:16:48,651 --> 00:16:51,832
punctuated by troughs of slightly lower intensity

291
00:16:52,072 --> 00:16:53,753
so as not to desensitize the player.

292
00:16:54,733 --> 00:16:57,854
And this pattern is repeated throughout all the levels

293
00:16:57,894 --> 00:16:59,495
and throughout all the mechanics in most games

294
00:17:00,495 --> 00:17:01,735
almost to a fractal level.

295
00:17:03,136 --> 00:17:05,637
And it's my belief that if you do this in a game

296
00:17:06,637 --> 00:17:08,878
it becomes predictable pretty fast.

297
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:15,249
So Alex Mandryka, who was formerly the creative director at Relic,

298
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:17,210
wrote a paper on Game of Sutra,

299
00:17:18,131 --> 00:17:22,034
in which he explained that fun is actually created through uncertainty.

300
00:17:22,815 --> 00:17:25,717
And by constantly flipping the player in and out of his comfort zone,

301
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:27,739
you can create quite a lot of fun.

302
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,682
And the best way to do this is to be subversive,

303
00:17:31,782 --> 00:17:33,724
to take an existing game design paradigm,

304
00:17:34,164 --> 00:17:36,406
like the aforementioned pacing, and flip it.

305
00:17:38,235 --> 00:17:42,557
My favorite example of this is the Ishimura level in Dead Space 2.

306
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,318
Has everyone here played Dead Space 2?

307
00:17:46,459 --> 00:17:48,460
Well, not as many people as I thought.

308
00:17:48,961 --> 00:17:50,461
That's upsetting, because Dead Space 2 is ace.

309
00:17:52,662 --> 00:17:54,283
Is anyone here going to play Dead Space 2?

310
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,204
Because I'm about to spoil the Ishimura level.

311
00:17:57,945 --> 00:17:58,645
Well, that's a shame.

312
00:17:58,966 --> 00:18:01,427
Anyway, so when you get to the Ishimura in Dead Space 2,

313
00:18:01,487 --> 00:18:03,028
the Ishimura is the spaceship from Dead Space 1.

314
00:18:04,353 --> 00:18:06,334
You've been fighting Necromorphs all the way through the game.

315
00:18:07,374 --> 00:18:08,274
And you get to the issue and you think,

316
00:18:08,294 --> 00:18:11,495
this is the spaceship from Dead Space 1, this is going to be full of nasty aliens.

317
00:18:11,955 --> 00:18:12,395
And you get in,

318
00:18:13,455 --> 00:18:13,735
nothing.

319
00:18:14,735 --> 00:18:16,136
You're like, oh, okay, that's a bit strange.

320
00:18:16,956 --> 00:18:18,136
Five minutes later, it's the level,

321
00:18:18,156 --> 00:18:19,256
you're thinking, okay, right,

322
00:18:20,056 --> 00:18:21,637
bring on the aliens, nothing.

323
00:18:23,017 --> 00:18:25,357
Ten minutes into the level, you're like,

324
00:18:26,557 --> 00:18:27,518
shit, where are the aliens?

325
00:18:28,198 --> 00:18:29,238
There's still no aliens.

326
00:18:29,518 --> 00:18:31,678
And it's not until fifteen minutes into the Ishimura level...

327
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:35,163
when you reach the spaceship's central transport corridor,

328
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:38,265
this massive, great big monster drops from the ceiling,

329
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:39,827
and at this point, you're ready to wet yourself,

330
00:18:40,027 --> 00:18:41,148
figuratively speaking, obviously.

331
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,552
And this is quite cool, so they've disrupted this pacing.

332
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,194
I'm quite lucky to know the producer on that level,

333
00:18:48,975 --> 00:18:50,857
and when I found out that he was responsible,

334
00:18:50,877 --> 00:18:51,497
I was really excited.

335
00:18:51,517 --> 00:18:54,059
I was like, Matt, Matt, how did you work out

336
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:55,300
this paradigm shift?

337
00:18:55,341 --> 00:18:56,181
It's brilliant.

338
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:57,643
Did you watch a lot of horror movies?

339
00:18:58,503 --> 00:18:58,804
Did you...

340
00:19:00,177 --> 00:19:01,977
read, take a course on horror writing,

341
00:19:02,538 --> 00:19:04,738
did you do loads of tests and do psychometric analysis,

342
00:19:04,778 --> 00:19:05,319
how did you do it?

343
00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:07,199
He goes, well no, we didn't really have any choice

344
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,660
because we didn't have time to build

345
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,621
any new level geometry, so we had to reuse

346
00:19:11,661 --> 00:19:14,262
the old Ishimura, and we weren't allowed to change it

347
00:19:14,282 --> 00:19:15,503
because that would mess with the canon,

348
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:19,504
and the game director was very insistent

349
00:19:19,564 --> 00:19:21,285
that we showcase this massive big monster

350
00:19:21,325 --> 00:19:22,985
and he wouldn't let us use any other monsters

351
00:19:23,046 --> 00:19:24,446
as the first encounter in the level,

352
00:19:24,686 --> 00:19:25,907
so we didn't have a choice.

353
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,091
And this kind of worked out quite well,

354
00:19:30,471 --> 00:19:31,852
because this restrictive design

355
00:19:32,473 --> 00:19:35,975
has really forced my friend to take a big risk with the pacing.

356
00:19:43,201 --> 00:19:45,122
And taking risks is important if you want to stand out.

357
00:19:49,205 --> 00:19:52,027
Now, it's easy for me to stand up here and talk about taking risks.

358
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:54,409
I see now it's working.

359
00:19:55,084 --> 00:19:59,367
It's important for me, it's easy for me to stand up here and talk about taking risks, but...

360
00:20:01,508 --> 00:20:05,411
We all know that the problem with risks is that they are inherently risky.

361
00:20:06,892 --> 00:20:09,674
It's the designer's responsibility to manage this risk sensibly.

362
00:20:10,054 --> 00:20:13,857
So design your levels diligently on paper, but don't forget that what looks good on paper

363
00:20:14,417 --> 00:20:16,138
doesn't always work once you get it into the game.

364
00:20:16,699 --> 00:20:18,220
And oddly enough, the reverse of this is true.

365
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:21,482
Sometimes some really ridiculous ideas actually work very well when you test them in game.

366
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:28,087
It's absolutely crucial that if you've got anything risky, you greybox it and test it as soon as possible.

367
00:20:28,668 --> 00:20:32,992
Otherwise, you'll risk getting it cut as your game hurdles toward its next milestone

368
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:35,434
and your producer's looking at this crazy idea and thinking,

369
00:20:35,954 --> 00:20:37,636
mmm, that's a bit risky, I'm going to cut it.

370
00:20:40,598 --> 00:20:44,682
So on Medal of Honor, we designed these awesome little, kind of, grenade puzzles.

371
00:20:45,427 --> 00:20:47,128
where you could access hidden areas of the level

372
00:20:47,468 --> 00:20:48,869
by chucking grenades down vents

373
00:20:49,029 --> 00:20:51,731
and flushing Nazis out of otherwise impregnable bunkers.

374
00:20:52,332 --> 00:20:54,253
Unfortunately, very late in production,

375
00:20:54,273 --> 00:20:55,114
we hadn't proved it out.

376
00:20:55,314 --> 00:20:55,994
It wasn't quite working.

377
00:20:56,034 --> 00:20:56,955
It ended up getting cut

378
00:20:58,156 --> 00:20:59,417
just because we hadn't tested it enough

379
00:20:59,657 --> 00:21:00,718
or we hadn't tested it early enough.

380
00:21:01,499 --> 00:21:02,339
And this was a big shame

381
00:21:02,379 --> 00:21:03,980
because it would have really helped

382
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,822
towards a feeling of player empowerment.

383
00:21:07,623 --> 00:21:08,083
And the next...

384
00:21:08,784 --> 00:21:10,485
This is my favorite slide.

385
00:21:11,266 --> 00:21:12,767
The next principle is that good level design...

386
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:15,811
empowers the player.

387
00:21:19,933 --> 00:21:22,995
The 18th century poet, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,

388
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:24,796
and for those of you that were born after 1985,

389
00:21:25,316 --> 00:21:26,577
that's him in the picture.

390
00:21:31,299 --> 00:21:33,781
Goethe said that you should dream no small dreams,

391
00:21:34,621 --> 00:21:37,082
for they have no power to move the hearts of men.

392
00:21:38,183 --> 00:21:39,964
And I think this is the 18th century equivalent

393
00:21:40,484 --> 00:21:42,205
of the phrase, go big or go home.

394
00:21:43,699 --> 00:21:45,341
And as a level designer, you should definitely do this.

395
00:21:45,381 --> 00:21:46,642
You should eschew the mundane.

396
00:21:46,862 --> 00:21:48,984
You should never give your player shopping list missions.

397
00:21:49,124 --> 00:21:51,566
Because essentially, video games are escapism.

398
00:21:51,966 --> 00:21:54,328
And why would people want to escape to somewhere that they

399
00:21:54,348 --> 00:21:55,389
could go in real life?

400
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:58,612
Because quite frankly, real life sucks.

401
00:21:59,993 --> 00:22:03,716
Has anyone here seen the TV show Charlie

402
00:22:03,736 --> 00:22:04,617
Brooker's Games Wipe?

403
00:22:06,885 --> 00:22:09,448
Wow, almost as many people who've played Dead Space 2.

404
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:14,272
You should see this, it's actually the most entertaining piece of TV

405
00:22:14,413 --> 00:22:16,254
ever made about video games, in my opinion anyway.

406
00:22:16,895 --> 00:22:17,636
And it's on YouTube.

407
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:19,918
But anyway, in this TV show,

408
00:22:20,518 --> 00:22:24,622
the Irish comedian Dara O'Brien explains why he's never got to the third island

409
00:22:24,662 --> 00:22:25,203
in GTA 4.

410
00:22:26,697 --> 00:22:31,879
because there's this mission where he has to drive all the way across town in rush hour traffic

411
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:34,780
and he has to drive carefully so as not to upset the police

412
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,601
and he has to go through a toll bridge

413
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:40,703
he even has to pay the toll, he has to drive carefully through the gates and not crash

414
00:22:40,743 --> 00:22:42,423
he can't speed through otherwise he'll upset the police

415
00:22:42,703 --> 00:22:46,665
and if he gets caught by the police he gets arrested and he has to go right back to the start and do it again

416
00:22:46,945 --> 00:22:48,566
and he was playing this one afternoon and he thought

417
00:22:49,998 --> 00:22:52,860
Hang on a second, I can drive in rush hour traffic in real life.

418
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,461
What am I doing playing this video game?

419
00:22:54,481 --> 00:22:56,982
So he just stopped, and he's never got to the last island on GTA.

420
00:22:58,583 --> 00:23:02,065
In most games, players want to be badasses.

421
00:23:02,766 --> 00:23:06,468
And a title that does this really well is Red Faction Guerrilla.

422
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:10,291
And it really delivers the fantasy of being a Martian rebel.

423
00:23:10,671 --> 00:23:13,173
It doesn't give you a mission to drive across a toll bridge.

424
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:16,595
It gives you a mission to destroy a toll bridge

425
00:23:17,075 --> 00:23:19,356
using a sniper rifle that vaporizes metal.

426
00:23:21,315 --> 00:23:22,755
Now this is super, super empowering,

427
00:23:24,296 --> 00:23:30,098
as it lets the player see his effect on the environment straight away.

428
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,800
And the key gameplay mechanic in Red Faction really helps this,

429
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:33,980
the destructible terrain.

430
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:36,301
So this is kind of an unfair example.

431
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:38,242
But whilst this mechanic does help,

432
00:23:38,702 --> 00:23:41,383
you don't need such an obvious mechanic to do this in your levels

433
00:23:42,604 --> 00:23:46,125
if you design them to show the player's influence.

434
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:50,247
I like the way that Infamous does this.

435
00:23:51,132 --> 00:23:56,654
So many missions in Infamous necessitate a karmic choice of some sort.

436
00:23:56,834 --> 00:23:59,235
You can either be good or you can be evil when you complete the mission.

437
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:03,656
And in fact, this karma system is peripherated

438
00:24:04,177 --> 00:24:05,977
throughout the entire open-world environment.

439
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:08,158
For example, there are bombs throughout the town,

440
00:24:08,578 --> 00:24:10,459
which you can either defuse to save people,

441
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,980
or you can let them explode and absorb their power and become stronger,

442
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,741
but as a result, collateral damage.

443
00:24:16,782 --> 00:24:18,922
Now, a karma system isn't particularly special in a game.

444
00:24:18,942 --> 00:24:19,903
There are lots of games that do it.

445
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:28,111
But what Infamous does really well is the subtle ways in which it shows the consequence of your karmic choices.

446
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:33,373
So, for example, the citizens of the city, citizens of the city,

447
00:24:36,043 --> 00:24:39,324
If you take good karmic choices, the better you become, the more they'll help you.

448
00:24:39,864 --> 00:24:42,085
So, they'll start cheering when you walk past,

449
00:24:42,185 --> 00:24:44,366
or they'll start throwing rocks at the bad guys you're trying to fight.

450
00:24:44,446 --> 00:24:47,186
And conversely, if you're evil, they'll start booing you,

451
00:24:47,646 --> 00:24:48,787
in a kind of pantomime style,

452
00:24:49,407 --> 00:24:50,707
and then they'll start throwing rocks at you,

453
00:24:51,067 --> 00:24:54,048
which is a kind of nice little way of showing the player that his actions

454
00:24:54,688 --> 00:24:55,648
do have a consequence.

455
00:24:57,441 --> 00:25:02,905
In Medal of Honor, we put allied hostages in some of the levels that you could rescue.

456
00:25:03,366 --> 00:25:06,568
And if you rescue these hostages, they'd pop up later on in the level to help you out.

457
00:25:07,188 --> 00:25:10,531
So depending on how you played some of the levels, if you were a little more daring,

458
00:25:10,951 --> 00:25:12,252
they'd be a little easier later on.

459
00:25:14,074 --> 00:25:16,015
Which leads me to the next principle,

460
00:25:16,956 --> 00:25:21,620
that good level design is easy, medium, and hard.

461
00:25:23,361 --> 00:25:24,422
Now what on earth does this mean?

462
00:25:24,462 --> 00:25:25,823
How can a level be easy, medium, and hard?

463
00:25:26,294 --> 00:25:30,297
Well, I've got to confess that I've got a bit of a

464
00:25:30,337 --> 00:25:32,198
bee in my bonnet or an axe to grind or what have you

465
00:25:32,719 --> 00:25:35,241
with the standard difficulty select screen

466
00:25:35,261 --> 00:25:36,562
that you see in a lot of video games.

467
00:25:38,143 --> 00:25:41,706
I think it's archaic. It asks the player to make an arbitrary choice

468
00:25:42,406 --> 00:25:44,788
which will affect how the entire game

469
00:25:45,088 --> 00:25:47,450
handles for him or her with no knowledge

470
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:49,651
of how his skill stacks up against the game mechanics.

471
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:52,714
Why can't the player choose in-game

472
00:25:53,794 --> 00:25:54,835
simply by playing the game?

473
00:25:56,112 --> 00:25:59,074
I'm of course alluding to the use of risk reward.

474
00:26:00,114 --> 00:26:02,115
So this works in terms of level design

475
00:26:02,596 --> 00:26:04,697
by designing multiple pathways through your level.

476
00:26:05,057 --> 00:26:06,978
So you always design the basic path through your level

477
00:26:07,578 --> 00:26:09,319
to present an easy to medium challenge.

478
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,681
And then you have clearly called out high risk paths

479
00:26:14,282 --> 00:26:16,162
with an obvious reward or conversely,

480
00:26:16,863 --> 00:26:20,465
easier paths if your main path starts to get a little tough.

481
00:26:21,445 --> 00:26:22,326
And it's important when you do this

482
00:26:22,346 --> 00:26:23,706
to use the visual language that I mentioned

483
00:26:23,726 --> 00:26:24,727
in the first principle.

484
00:26:25,745 --> 00:26:27,426
And the king of risk-reward in games is...

485
00:26:28,907 --> 00:26:29,367
Burnout.

486
00:26:31,128 --> 00:26:33,109
Now in Burnout, on the tracks,

487
00:26:33,269 --> 00:26:34,430
there's always, there are always

488
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:36,811
narrow shortcuts. They're clearly more risky

489
00:26:36,851 --> 00:26:37,652
because they're narrow.

490
00:26:38,352 --> 00:26:41,014
They're always called out by a bright yellow barricade

491
00:26:41,054 --> 00:26:42,114
which is their visual language.

492
00:26:44,316 --> 00:26:45,176
And they always provide

493
00:26:45,196 --> 00:26:45,876
a really obvious

494
00:26:46,997 --> 00:26:48,958
reduction in your lap time, or some sweet

495
00:26:49,058 --> 00:26:50,099
air so you can get some boost.

496
00:26:51,425 --> 00:26:53,607
There's no difficulty select screen in Burnout,

497
00:26:54,387 --> 00:26:57,089
because the players can select their own difficulty dynamically.

498
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:00,772
And this isn't just applicable to racing games.

499
00:27:03,934 --> 00:27:05,395
You can use a multi-layered approach

500
00:27:06,415 --> 00:27:08,156
in RPGs, action adventures,

501
00:27:08,657 --> 00:27:09,597
first-person shooters.

502
00:27:11,299 --> 00:27:12,419
You can place a powerful weapon

503
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,820
in a tricky-to-reach spot,

504
00:27:14,901 --> 00:27:16,342
necessitating navigational risk.

505
00:27:17,227 --> 00:27:20,769
you can place a dangerous enemy with a clearly called out flanking route

506
00:27:21,209 --> 00:27:24,370
allowing people who are skilled in stealth an opportunity to reduce the risk.

507
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:29,652
These side paths can also be a puzzle requiring a little more cerebral skill

508
00:27:30,052 --> 00:27:33,453
to access. For an example, an object that can be seen

509
00:27:33,793 --> 00:27:35,694
but the root of that object is hidden

510
00:27:36,394 --> 00:27:38,515
or secret areas that are called out with a visual cue.

511
00:27:40,375 --> 00:27:44,356
I still have a slight problem with flickering neon lights.

512
00:27:45,237 --> 00:27:48,017
Every time I'm near one, I feel compelled to look for secret doors,

513
00:27:48,118 --> 00:27:50,278
because I played too much Doom when I was at university.

514
00:27:52,619 --> 00:27:55,820
So games like Dishonored use this layered approach to good effect.

515
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,501
They fill the level with multiple paths,

516
00:28:00,001 --> 00:28:02,161
various styles and various aptitudes of player.

517
00:28:05,668 --> 00:28:08,072
And this, uh, these multiple gameplay layers

518
00:28:08,332 --> 00:28:10,135
also extend the replayability of their levels,

519
00:28:10,475 --> 00:28:11,917
which makes for efficient design.

520
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,361
And good level design.

521
00:28:15,499 --> 00:28:21,903
is efficient. Now, this is classic data ramps. A video game always has a very finite amount

522
00:28:21,923 --> 00:28:26,606
of resources, whether that's the technical limitations of the hardware that you're developing

523
00:28:26,666 --> 00:28:32,650
on, such as the memory or the pixel pushing power, to the real world constraints like

524
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:36,473
your production schedule, the number of people on your team, the scope of your projects,

525
00:28:36,533 --> 00:28:42,057
and so on. And it's a designer's responsibility to maximize the use of those resources.

526
00:28:43,026 --> 00:28:46,048
And for level design, this means not only using the whole animal nose to tail,

527
00:28:46,548 --> 00:28:48,550
but doing it more than once, and doing it quickly.

528
00:28:51,692 --> 00:28:53,553
For this, modular design is your friend.

529
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:57,055
A good level designer doesn't create a level,

530
00:28:57,615 --> 00:29:00,617
he creates a series of modular, mechanic-driven encounters

531
00:29:01,358 --> 00:29:02,999
that you can string together to make a level.

532
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:04,880
And another level.

533
00:29:05,641 --> 00:29:06,241
And another level.

534
00:29:08,352 --> 00:29:14,456
On top of this, this technique also creates a series of familiar moments that the player can use to learn and master your mechanics.

535
00:29:15,096 --> 00:29:19,518
I don't know if any of you have had a chance to check out the toolkits that ship with Bethesda games,

536
00:29:20,239 --> 00:29:21,960
but these are extremely modular.

537
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:27,743
They're essentially like medieval Lego or post-apocalyptic Lego, depending on which game you're playing with.

538
00:29:28,843 --> 00:29:34,467
And it's through this modularity that such a relatively small team can create such a massive amount of content.

539
00:29:36,044 --> 00:29:39,545
And also by applying simple modifiers to these modules,

540
00:29:39,785 --> 00:29:41,285
it's possible to create variation

541
00:29:41,625 --> 00:29:44,266
and keep things fresh by providing increased challenge

542
00:29:44,626 --> 00:29:45,266
and surprise.

543
00:29:46,386 --> 00:29:49,047
Modifiers are particularly important for creating

544
00:29:50,407 --> 00:29:51,647
bi-directional gameplay.

545
00:29:53,508 --> 00:29:56,388
Now, your level artists or your world artists

546
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:59,069
are going to spend a lot of time making the levels that you

547
00:29:59,089 --> 00:29:59,349
design.

548
00:30:00,614 --> 00:30:01,195
look beautiful.

549
00:30:01,915 --> 00:30:05,879
When the unfortunate reality is that most players will blitz through them in a matter

550
00:30:05,899 --> 00:30:06,360
of seconds.

551
00:30:07,081 --> 00:30:11,785
Now, how do you keep your level artists happy and get the most bang for your art buck?

552
00:30:12,886 --> 00:30:15,389
Well, you need to reuse the nice artwork from your level.

553
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:19,373
Now the most obvious way to do this is to make your player backtrack a lot.

554
00:30:19,733 --> 00:30:21,215
But backtracking is totally not cool.

555
00:30:22,719 --> 00:30:25,320
What you should do instead is design for bi-directional gameplay.

556
00:30:25,781 --> 00:30:28,602
So what I mean by that is, gameplay on the way there

557
00:30:29,322 --> 00:30:31,583
is totally different to gameplay on the way back.

558
00:30:32,063 --> 00:30:34,665
And a game series that does this very well is Halo.

559
00:30:35,465 --> 00:30:39,087
So for example, in Halo 1, the level 343 Guilty Spark

560
00:30:39,107 --> 00:30:40,507
is awesome for bi-directionality.

561
00:30:40,527 --> 00:30:43,689
It begins as a search mission with exploratory gameplay

562
00:30:44,389 --> 00:30:47,251
and then when you unleash the flood, all hell breaks loose

563
00:30:47,351 --> 00:30:49,051
and it's intense combat on the way back.

564
00:30:50,267 --> 00:30:53,069
Similarly, in Halo 3, in the mission, The Ark,

565
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:56,832
you fight through a desert level on foot using a sniper rifle.

566
00:30:56,932 --> 00:30:58,413
And then when you get to the mission to Apex,

567
00:30:58,894 --> 00:31:00,115
you get a tank air dropped in.

568
00:31:00,175 --> 00:31:01,996
And you can blast your way out of the level in a tank.

569
00:31:02,897 --> 00:31:04,198
Totally, totally different gameplay.

570
00:31:08,382 --> 00:31:09,703
Expanding on this principle further,

571
00:31:10,143 --> 00:31:11,745
levels, and in fact, the entire game,

572
00:31:12,385 --> 00:31:14,467
can be made totally nonlinear.

573
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:20,889
A great way of doing this is to provide implicit objectives that require intuition and exploration

574
00:31:20,929 --> 00:31:21,470
to complete.

575
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:26,831
So the skulls in Halo, the cog tags in Gears of War, and the feathers in Assassin's Creed.

576
00:31:28,772 --> 00:31:33,093
These are all designed to encourage non-linear exploration and extend the gameplay with no

577
00:31:33,153 --> 00:31:34,073
extra hit production.

578
00:31:34,474 --> 00:31:37,835
But these are actually not great examples of non-linear gameplay.

579
00:31:39,474 --> 00:31:43,737
Because it's very important that you don't create gameplay for gameplay's sake.

580
00:31:43,757 --> 00:31:44,818
Just to pad out your game.

581
00:31:44,838 --> 00:31:49,861
You need to keep your non-linearity relevant by incentivizing the player by calling out

582
00:31:50,201 --> 00:31:51,542
clearly the reward in advance.

583
00:31:52,003 --> 00:31:54,805
The heart in Dishonored is a great example of this.

584
00:31:55,345 --> 00:32:00,529
In fact, you should also try and tie these objectives into the main narrative thread.

585
00:32:01,549 --> 00:32:08,414
There's this awesome old Game Boy Advance game called Astro Boy Omega Factor.

586
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:10,371
that does this beautifully,

587
00:32:11,652 --> 00:32:14,193
by actually making replaying the levels a key narrative element.

588
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:16,294
Once you've finished the game and played through all the levels,

589
00:32:16,694 --> 00:32:19,056
you're treated to a really quite a disappointing ending.

590
00:32:19,836 --> 00:32:21,497
But somebody appears and sends Astro Boy

591
00:32:21,977 --> 00:32:23,838
all the way back in time to the start of the game

592
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:27,200
with all of the power-ups and weapons that he's collected.

593
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,782
He can then play through the game,

594
00:32:30,322 --> 00:32:31,883
zapping backwards and forwards in time,

595
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:34,204
using all of his different power-ups to select the levels,

596
00:32:34,564 --> 00:32:36,465
defeat monsters that he couldn't defeat before,

597
00:32:36,886 --> 00:32:37,926
open up secret areas.

598
00:32:39,171 --> 00:32:43,054
and ultimately get the much more rewarding, true conclusion to the game.

599
00:32:43,555 --> 00:32:48,579
So essentially, what this plot device does is massage the player into playing through the entire game.

600
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:49,760
Twice.

601
00:32:50,661 --> 00:32:52,382
Which is pretty cool, because when you do complete it,

602
00:32:53,183 --> 00:32:54,864
the finale is really emotional.

603
00:33:00,649 --> 00:33:04,672
Which is why rule number nine is that good level design creates emotion.

604
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:10,474
Last year, the US Supreme Court, there they are, bless their little cotton socks,

605
00:33:11,794 --> 00:33:16,897
declared that video games were legally art, which is ace.

606
00:33:18,378 --> 00:33:20,559
According to the dictionary, art is

607
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:25,942
the quality, production, expression, or realm, according to aesthetic principles,

608
00:33:26,402 --> 00:33:30,684
of what is beautiful, appealing, or of more than ordinary significance.

609
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,621
This is a kind of dry, pragmatic definition of art for me.

610
00:33:35,521 --> 00:33:39,003
From a purely subjective and personal standpoint,

611
00:33:39,563 --> 00:33:41,764
I like to think of art as anything that's been specifically created

612
00:33:41,804 --> 00:33:43,685
to provoke an emotional reaction.

613
00:33:44,665 --> 00:33:48,707
So paintings, sculpture, photography, music, movies,

614
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:52,088
all of these are created to encourage some kind of emotional response

615
00:33:52,628 --> 00:33:53,329
in their recipient.

616
00:33:53,769 --> 00:33:56,430
This is particularly true for an interactive medium like video games.

617
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:00,532
Now the most analogous form of art to level design

618
00:34:01,258 --> 00:34:03,176
is, surprise, surprise, architecture.

619
00:34:04,245 --> 00:34:06,026
And architects have been playing with people's emotions

620
00:34:06,426 --> 00:34:07,706
for hundreds and hundreds of years.

621
00:34:07,766 --> 00:34:09,547
And there are loads of great architectural theories

622
00:34:09,827 --> 00:34:10,848
that we can steal from them.

623
00:34:11,788 --> 00:34:12,769
For example, windows.

624
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:15,550
If windows are placed below knee height,

625
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:18,152
that's because the architect wanted to convey

626
00:34:18,312 --> 00:34:20,333
the feeling of power and voyeurism.

627
00:34:22,294 --> 00:34:24,715
Conversely, if windows are placed above shoulder height,

628
00:34:25,195 --> 00:34:26,816
the architect wanted to invoke

629
00:34:26,916 --> 00:34:28,717
a feeling of persecution and imprisonment.

630
00:34:28,737 --> 00:34:29,957
Although I'm not entirely sure

631
00:34:29,997 --> 00:34:31,458
why an architect would want to do that

632
00:34:32,038 --> 00:34:33,299
unless he was designing a prison.

633
00:34:34,837 --> 00:34:39,484
Architects make curved rooms with no corners to induce a feeling of womb-like calm in their buildings.

634
00:34:40,666 --> 00:34:43,932
There are also a lot of classic level design tricks that you can use to create...

635
00:34:45,734 --> 00:34:46,536
spatial empathy.

636
00:34:48,681 --> 00:34:51,064
You can use tight corners to limit the player's field of view,

637
00:34:51,324 --> 00:34:53,366
to keep him tense and suspicious and claustrophobic.

638
00:34:53,947 --> 00:34:57,851
You can make your level twisty and labyrinthine to create confusion and panic.

639
00:34:58,571 --> 00:35:00,553
Alternatively, you can blow that space wide open

640
00:35:00,974 --> 00:35:04,297
to create a feeling of isolation and epic scale.

641
00:35:04,818 --> 00:35:08,842
Even switching from a narrow space to a large space is a great technique

642
00:35:09,142 --> 00:35:12,365
to force the player to look at a specific vista to create a sense of wonder.

643
00:35:13,797 --> 00:35:15,818
You can bring verticality into the mix

644
00:35:15,858 --> 00:35:17,258
to create a feeling of persecution

645
00:35:17,298 --> 00:35:18,638
by attacking the player from above,

646
00:35:19,378 --> 00:35:21,719
a feeling of vertigo by making the player scale

647
00:35:21,779 --> 00:35:23,199
a high mountain or a high building,

648
00:35:23,999 --> 00:35:25,560
or a feeling of hope by placing a reward

649
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,660
at the top of a tall building.

650
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:31,381
The new Tomb Raider does this really well.

651
00:35:32,081 --> 00:35:34,322
It goes from super narrow caves to wide open jungle

652
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:35,982
and really leverages the space

653
00:35:36,542 --> 00:35:38,163
or lack thereof to create emotion.

654
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,843
And aside from spatial empathy,

655
00:35:41,223 --> 00:35:42,143
when designing for emotion,

656
00:35:43,571 --> 00:35:46,312
I personally find that the best technique is to work backwards.

657
00:35:47,552 --> 00:35:51,554
So your starting point should be the desired emotional response you want to evoke from

658
00:35:51,574 --> 00:35:52,034
the player.

659
00:35:52,714 --> 00:35:56,636
Then you should drill down and select the spatial parameters, the narrative elements

660
00:35:56,756 --> 00:36:01,178
and mechanics that you want to use to elicit that emotion.

661
00:36:01,918 --> 00:36:07,480
So if you want to make the player feel persecuted, put an enemy AI into your level that constantly

662
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:07,880
hunts him.

663
00:36:09,105 --> 00:36:14,210
If you want the player to feel exhilarated, engage them in a high-speed chase or a firefight

664
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:16,412
in a large open space or an open road.

665
00:36:17,233 --> 00:36:20,777
If you want the player to feel a sense of urgency, modify your core mechanics with some

666
00:36:20,817 --> 00:36:21,578
kind of time limit.

667
00:36:22,899 --> 00:36:26,603
If you want the player to feel a sense of desperation, give them an almost impossible

668
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:32,449
goal and then save them at the last minute, like Company of Heroes does in the Carentan

669
00:36:32,489 --> 00:36:32,709
mission.

670
00:36:33,987 --> 00:36:37,972
Now this is an interesting mission for me because in this level of Company of Heroes,

671
00:36:38,432 --> 00:36:43,678
you are asked to protect the town of Carentan against a Nazi invasion force until Allied

672
00:36:43,718 --> 00:36:44,779
reinforcements arrive.

673
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:49,344
And so if you guys thought the same thing that I did when I was given that mission objective,

674
00:36:49,444 --> 00:36:53,068
I thought, that's cool, all I have to do is hold out for a certain amount of time.

675
00:36:54,304 --> 00:36:55,825
and then my reinforcements will arrive.

676
00:36:56,385 --> 00:36:58,845
But Company of Heroes effectively lies to the player

677
00:36:58,885 --> 00:36:59,926
about the mission parameters,

678
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:02,546
because the reinforcements aren't triggered by a timer.

679
00:37:03,106 --> 00:37:05,907
They're triggered by the number of soldiers you have left alive.

680
00:37:06,127 --> 00:37:07,868
So they will only ever appear

681
00:37:08,288 --> 00:37:09,768
when you have two soldiers left.

682
00:37:11,689 --> 00:37:14,829
Now, this makes this battle super, super intense.

683
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:16,230
And in fact,

684
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:20,031
using the game mechanics like this to create emotion

685
00:37:20,391 --> 00:37:23,131
is possibly the single most important goal of a level designer.

686
00:37:23,907 --> 00:37:27,187
which is why the final principle is that good level design

687
00:37:28,067 --> 00:37:29,448
is driven by mechanics.

688
00:37:33,789 --> 00:37:36,449
Now, there's a, I read this quote somewhere on the internet,

689
00:37:36,469 --> 00:37:38,470
and apologies to whoever I'm stealing it from

690
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:40,970
because I couldn't find it again, and I don't know who said it.

691
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:42,130
But the quote goes,

692
00:37:43,091 --> 00:37:46,231
that books let you imagine extraordinary things.

693
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:50,232
Movies let you see extraordinary things.

694
00:37:52,608 --> 00:37:56,750
But video games let you actually do extraordinary things.

695
00:37:58,991 --> 00:38:03,633
And so, above all else, great level design is driven by this interaction, the game's

696
00:38:03,693 --> 00:38:04,153
mechanics.

697
00:38:05,274 --> 00:38:11,297
Game levels don't just provide the context or the setting for the mechanics, they provide

698
00:38:11,317 --> 00:38:13,398
the very reality in which they exist.

699
00:38:14,518 --> 00:38:16,560
Now I'm going to apologize in advance for this next slide,

700
00:38:17,281 --> 00:38:20,084
and for the slightly highfalutin word smithery,

701
00:38:20,564 --> 00:38:22,206
but I like to describe a game's level

702
00:38:22,786 --> 00:38:24,148
as the metaphysical medium

703
00:38:24,508 --> 00:38:26,090
through which the gameplay is delivered.

704
00:38:27,231 --> 00:38:29,733
So I'm going to expand on this by means of an analogy,

705
00:38:30,234 --> 00:38:32,016
and I'd like you to think of your video game as a painting.

706
00:38:33,357 --> 00:38:35,439
So the subject of your painting, what you're painting,

707
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,321
those are your gameplay mechanics,

708
00:38:37,341 --> 00:38:38,122
that's your gameplay mechanics.

709
00:38:39,295 --> 00:38:44,717
The composition, what gives your subject its context.

710
00:38:45,237 --> 00:38:47,438
That's your narrative and your graphics.

711
00:38:49,979 --> 00:38:53,020
The medium, the actual oil and canvas

712
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,341
that you paint your painting with,

713
00:38:55,181 --> 00:38:56,161
is your game's level.

714
00:38:57,702 --> 00:39:00,002
Your level should be a gameplay delivery system

715
00:39:00,283 --> 00:39:02,723
whose primary function is to leverage your mechanics

716
00:39:02,783 --> 00:39:04,264
to create a great experience.

717
00:39:05,325 --> 00:39:11,271
Topology, architecture, objectives, interactions, combat scenarios, etc. should all be designed

718
00:39:12,493 --> 00:39:14,174
to showcase your game's mechanics.

719
00:39:15,876 --> 00:39:19,560
Now it's important to have a thorough understanding of your mechanics in order to do this, but

720
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:23,023
I appreciate that this isn't always possible as your mechanics and your levels are being

721
00:39:23,063 --> 00:39:23,924
developed concurrently.

722
00:39:26,368 --> 00:39:29,309
But you should always have a rough idea of the sort of systems that are being built.

723
00:39:29,709 --> 00:39:32,110
Conversely, this can work the other way around.

724
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:35,371
If you have, if there's something that you want that's cool in your level,

725
00:39:35,971 --> 00:39:39,572
talk to your lead mechanic engineer or your lead gameplay designer

726
00:39:39,592 --> 00:39:41,373
to see if you can get a mechanic to support it.

727
00:39:41,773 --> 00:39:44,613
In fact, interdisciplinary communication

728
00:39:45,053 --> 00:39:47,794
between engineers, designers, and artists is absolutely crucial

729
00:39:47,834 --> 00:39:49,355
if you want to have a strong level design team.

730
00:39:51,032 --> 00:39:57,154
My favorite game for, well, one of my favorite games for mechanic-based design is Deus Ex Human Revolution.

731
00:39:58,295 --> 00:40:04,477
So the levels in Deus Ex, they have multiple paths that showcase the stealth mechanics and the combat mechanics.

732
00:40:04,997 --> 00:40:08,518
They have specific moments for the player to use their augments.

733
00:40:11,219 --> 00:40:14,200
So areas where you can use your bionic arms to punch through walls,

734
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:18,701
you'll reinforce back to lift up heavy objects and reveal new paths through the level.

735
00:40:21,775 --> 00:40:24,496
unsuspecting enemies who are standing at the bottom of a really

736
00:40:24,856 --> 00:40:28,057
tall building. So you can use your Icarus drop to wipe them out in a really

737
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:32,219
flashy way. Even the secondary missions have been designed to leverage the mechanics.

738
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:35,060
So my favorite one is a mission where you have to

739
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:40,602
stun somebody and then drag their body over a balcony to make it look like a suicide.

740
00:40:40,962 --> 00:40:43,683
And this highlights the non-lethal takedowns,

741
00:40:44,783 --> 00:40:46,244
the body dragging mechanic,

742
00:40:47,984 --> 00:40:48,945
and the ragdoll physics.

743
00:40:50,335 --> 00:40:56,298
This particular mission is a really good example of creative reuse of the game's mechanics.

744
00:40:57,398 --> 00:41:03,841
Now when you start to showcase your mechanics, it's important that you don't just rinse and repeat the same little setup over and over again.

745
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:07,223
You need to find creative ways to modify these mechanics and keep them fresh.

746
00:41:08,746 --> 00:41:12,108
The Riddler Challenge is, in Batman Arkham City, a really good example of this,

747
00:41:12,588 --> 00:41:16,791
where the player has to use his equipment in clever new ways to unlock puzzles.

748
00:41:17,572 --> 00:41:22,115
This is cool because it extends the playtime and keeps the player learning.

749
00:41:22,876 --> 00:41:28,079
And the resultant cerebral gameplay fuels the fantasy of being the world's greatest detective,

750
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,041
rather than just a man in a cape who's great at kicking ass.

751
00:41:33,295 --> 00:41:35,316
So that's the 10th principle.

752
00:41:36,296 --> 00:41:37,696
For any of you who have fallen asleep

753
00:41:37,736 --> 00:41:39,677
during this presentation, this is a good time to wake up,

754
00:41:40,117 --> 00:41:42,318
because I'm about to recap and go through the entire 10

755
00:41:42,598 --> 00:41:43,779
rules in one slide.

756
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:46,200
But first, I'm going to take some water.

757
00:41:50,761 --> 00:41:54,363
So there it is again.

758
00:41:54,403 --> 00:41:56,304
Good level design is fun to navigate.

759
00:41:57,504 --> 00:41:59,265
Create a clear visual language, but feel

760
00:41:59,285 --> 00:42:00,485
free to throw in some chaos.

761
00:42:02,034 --> 00:42:04,695
Good level design does not rely on words to tell a story.

762
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:08,797
Use implicit and emergent narrative rather than explicit.

763
00:42:10,358 --> 00:42:12,559
Good level design tells the player what to do,

764
00:42:12,959 --> 00:42:13,880
but not how to do it.

765
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,601
Use clearly communicated objectives

766
00:42:15,961 --> 00:42:18,402
that players can complete in any way or order they want.

767
00:42:19,983 --> 00:42:21,864
Good level design constantly teaches the player

768
00:42:21,904 --> 00:42:22,424
something new.

769
00:42:23,785 --> 00:42:26,066
It keeps the player engaged by continuously introducing

770
00:42:26,166 --> 00:42:27,626
or subverting new mechanics.

771
00:42:29,608 --> 00:42:31,750
Good level design is surprising.

772
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:35,833
Don't be afraid to take risks with the pacing, aesthetics,

773
00:42:35,873 --> 00:42:36,573
or any other elements.

774
00:42:40,296 --> 00:42:41,998
Good level design empowers the player.

775
00:42:42,038 --> 00:42:43,319
Video games are escapism.

776
00:42:43,779 --> 00:42:46,301
Let the player feel the impact of his actions.

777
00:42:47,883 --> 00:42:50,645
Good level design is easy, medium, and hard.

778
00:42:50,805 --> 00:42:53,587
Use risk-reward so that the player can set the difficulty

779
00:42:53,627 --> 00:42:54,248
dynamically.

780
00:42:56,253 --> 00:42:59,616
Good level design is efficient design for modularity,

781
00:43:00,496 --> 00:43:02,398
bidirectionality, and non-linearity,

782
00:43:02,438 --> 00:43:03,338
and lots of other arities.

783
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,481
Good level design creates emotion.

784
00:43:08,142 --> 00:43:10,664
It begins at the end with the desired emotional response

785
00:43:10,824 --> 00:43:12,945
and works backwards to select the appropriate mechanics

786
00:43:13,466 --> 00:43:14,566
to elicit that response.

787
00:43:16,476 --> 00:43:19,779
And good level design is driven by the game's mechanics.

788
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,702
Above all, it showcases the game's mechanics

789
00:43:22,782 --> 00:43:25,424
through the medium of the level to reinforce

790
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:28,907
the uniquely interactive nature of video games.

791
00:43:29,848 --> 00:43:34,493
And those are the 10 principles of good level design.

792
00:43:34,513 --> 00:43:38,496
Congratulations.

793
00:43:38,516 --> 00:43:38,776
Thank you.

794
00:43:49,039 --> 00:43:51,680
If anyone's got any questions, I would be happy to answer them.

795
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,320
As long as they're not too hard.

796
00:44:00,942 --> 00:44:01,422
Oh, hello.

797
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:02,502
Hello.

798
00:44:02,762 --> 00:44:02,942
Hey.

799
00:44:03,162 --> 00:44:04,383
Hey, thank you, thank you.

800
00:44:04,403 --> 00:44:04,983
Thanks for the talk.

801
00:44:05,483 --> 00:44:05,803
You're welcome.

802
00:44:06,243 --> 00:44:10,904
I'm wondering if instead we want to switch the end to...

803
00:44:12,177 --> 00:44:17,526
Good level design is written by emotion and fueled by the mechanics.

804
00:44:18,207 --> 00:44:19,889
I mean, if we look at the...

805
00:44:20,962 --> 00:44:26,343
runaway hit of Journey that just happened, it's about the motion there, it's what emotion

806
00:44:26,403 --> 00:44:33,326
is listed through the game in the player, and the mechanics are all there to not empower

807
00:44:33,446 --> 00:44:38,828
but to help underline that emotion, like the mountain level, that it wasn't about making

808
00:44:38,868 --> 00:44:42,229
you feel great, it was about making you feel horrible.

809
00:44:43,009 --> 00:44:48,051
So your, just to make sure I understand, your question is that it should be more about an

810
00:44:48,091 --> 00:44:50,051
emotional reaction than the empowerment.

811
00:44:51,003 --> 00:44:57,471
I'm thinking that if we focus on the emotions that are coming through the player or we're

812
00:44:57,491 --> 00:45:02,957
trying to put into the level, instead of focusing on the mechanics, then the mechanics will

813
00:45:02,997 --> 00:45:07,202
fall into place and we'll have much more emotional experiences.

814
00:45:07,402 --> 00:45:08,763
I just want to know what your thoughts are on that.

815
00:45:09,124 --> 00:45:12,666
I think, so focusing on the emotions rather than the mechanics.

816
00:45:12,686 --> 00:45:14,888
So switching rules 9 and 10 essentially is what you're saying?

817
00:45:14,988 --> 00:45:15,188
Yes.

818
00:45:15,428 --> 00:45:18,370
Yeah, yeah, you can totally do that.

819
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:21,672
In fact, it is kind of an odd order.

820
00:45:21,732 --> 00:45:25,895
I tried really hard not to give these, to list these in order of priority.

821
00:45:26,956 --> 00:45:29,317
Even though I put what I thought was the most important one at the end.

822
00:45:30,918 --> 00:45:33,120
But you can weight them however you like.

823
00:45:35,421 --> 00:45:35,681
I think...

824
00:45:38,065 --> 00:45:40,191
If you're designing your levels to showcase mechanics,

825
00:45:40,832 --> 00:45:43,620
and you're picking the mechanics to drive the emotion,

826
00:45:44,361 --> 00:45:45,545
you're kind of doing that already.

827
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:46,900
if that makes sense.

828
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:47,741
Yeah, definitely.

829
00:45:47,781 --> 00:45:50,963
I'm just worried about putting too much of a focus on empowerment

830
00:45:51,363 --> 00:45:53,264
makes us tell a very certain type of story.

831
00:45:53,464 --> 00:45:54,225
Yes, yeah, yeah.

832
00:45:54,265 --> 00:45:57,907
So, I actually, I put these together before I'd played Journey,

833
00:45:58,568 --> 00:46:01,489
which, to my disgrace, I only played it a couple of weeks ago.

834
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:03,531
And it was awesome, which was great.

835
00:46:04,772 --> 00:46:06,653
And I was sitting through the Journey presentation,

836
00:46:07,273 --> 00:46:08,994
which was also great, yesterday.

837
00:46:09,014 --> 00:46:09,595
Was it yesterday?

838
00:46:10,102 --> 00:46:17,709
And I just thought, ooh, my level design presentation is kind of all about going in guns blazing and empowerment,

839
00:46:17,769 --> 00:46:24,156
and what my friend's wife likes to call the most important boy in the universe syndrome,

840
00:46:24,336 --> 00:46:29,301
where she thinks that most people play video games so they can feel like the most important boy in the universe.

841
00:46:31,638 --> 00:46:37,742
But I think you could certainly twist, not twist, but repurpose the empowerment principle

842
00:46:39,503 --> 00:46:41,924
to make the empowerment about being emotionally empowered.

843
00:46:41,985 --> 00:46:46,887
So being able to feel really sad.

844
00:46:46,907 --> 00:46:52,070
It's more about really delivering on the fantasy that you want the player to feel,

845
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:56,013
which doesn't necessarily have to be about being He-Man or being big and powerful.

846
00:46:56,776 --> 00:47:00,678
Yeah, maybe we want something more about an emotional intelligence instead of just empowerment.

847
00:47:00,758 --> 00:47:01,858
But just something to think about.

848
00:47:01,918 --> 00:47:02,618
No, no, that's awesome.

849
00:47:02,638 --> 00:47:03,179
Cool, thank you, thank you.

850
00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:03,519
Thank you.

851
00:47:05,499 --> 00:47:12,842
I was just wondering how your Doze commandments apply to the multiplayer aspect of levels.

852
00:47:13,063 --> 00:47:14,723
Ooh, interesting.

853
00:47:18,725 --> 00:47:19,345
Not sure.

854
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:24,167
I kind of wrote those from a single-player perspective in mind, but...

855
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,321
I would have to give that a little more thought.

856
00:47:29,042 --> 00:47:31,184
I'm going to defer that one and answer you by email.

857
00:47:31,204 --> 00:47:32,985
If you want to ping me an email, I'll have a think about it

858
00:47:33,005 --> 00:47:33,706
and get back to you.

859
00:47:33,806 --> 00:47:34,126
Will do.

860
00:47:36,788 --> 00:47:36,988
Hi.

861
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:37,709
Great talk.

862
00:47:37,829 --> 00:47:38,430
Thank you for coming.

863
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:39,070
Thank you very much.

864
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:44,254
My question is based on a couple of your rules, to me,

865
00:47:44,374 --> 00:47:46,656
seem to really encourage the player

866
00:47:47,357 --> 00:47:49,739
to take the time to figure out how to do things on their own.

867
00:47:50,039 --> 00:47:50,159
Yes.

868
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:55,244
The downside to that is obviously that the longer the player is working at that,

869
00:47:55,364 --> 00:47:57,686
the higher their level of frustration is climbing.

870
00:47:58,707 --> 00:48:03,452
I was wondering how you approach actually creating player frustration

871
00:48:03,512 --> 00:48:07,656
to enable them to actually discover new mechanics on their own

872
00:48:07,736 --> 00:48:10,198
instead of having text on screen to direct them.

873
00:48:14,337 --> 00:48:21,642
I think it's very important to trust the player to work out your mechanics.

874
00:48:21,702 --> 00:48:29,648
There's this constant balancing act you have to do between the amount of work and effort

875
00:48:29,668 --> 00:48:33,211
you put into a certain part of your level design and the percentage chance that the

876
00:48:33,231 --> 00:48:35,773
player is going to work it out.

877
00:48:35,873 --> 00:48:38,054
Different studios have very different approaches to this.

878
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,655
I remember on Medal of Honor...

879
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:42,257
a lot of the secondary objectives

880
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:45,460
which I put in to make the level feel more fleshed out

881
00:48:45,541 --> 00:48:46,942
and more interesting

882
00:48:47,743 --> 00:48:49,505
were actually turned into primary objectives

883
00:48:49,585 --> 00:48:51,707
because the gameplay director thought they were too cool

884
00:48:51,767 --> 00:48:53,169
to leave as secondary objectives

885
00:48:53,609 --> 00:48:55,431
which was kind of odd for me

886
00:48:55,451 --> 00:48:56,873
he was like, no, they're not too cool

887
00:48:56,893 --> 00:48:58,074
which was kind of strange

888
00:49:06,942 --> 00:49:09,103
Yeah, does that answer your question at all?

889
00:49:09,283 --> 00:49:11,244
It does. It does. Thank you.

890
00:49:11,304 --> 00:49:12,584
It's a matter of trust and balancing.

891
00:49:12,964 --> 00:49:16,025
There's no easy, quick answer for that, I'm afraid. Sorry.

892
00:49:18,846 --> 00:49:22,928
So I had a quick question about what you were talking about with efficiency specifically.

893
00:49:24,108 --> 00:49:29,810
You mentioned that you think that bi-directional levels are a very good idea.

894
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:31,831
And I definitely agree.

895
00:49:33,706 --> 00:49:36,827
But back when I was playing games, such as Halo 1,

896
00:49:37,247 --> 00:49:40,568
back in the day, all my friends would,

897
00:49:41,029 --> 00:49:43,370
my half-life playing friends, I was too poor

898
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:46,531
to have a good PC, my half-life playing friends,

899
00:49:46,971 --> 00:49:48,291
they would say things like, oh, well,

900
00:49:48,591 --> 00:49:49,892
why would you play a game with so much

901
00:49:49,932 --> 00:49:51,232
copy and paste level design?

902
00:49:51,533 --> 00:49:54,694
So I was wondering, what is a good way to

903
00:49:56,134 --> 00:49:58,675
make sure you don't make the players feel like

904
00:49:58,695 --> 00:50:00,396
it's too repetitious if they're...

905
00:50:01,522 --> 00:50:04,884
if you're playing backwards in a level, even if the gameplay is different?

906
00:50:07,506 --> 00:50:11,188
I think there are a couple of ways you can do this, actually.

907
00:50:11,228 --> 00:50:16,452
So, in terms of the gameplay, I've discussed using a modifier

908
00:50:16,492 --> 00:50:17,953
to change the gameplay on the way back.

909
00:50:19,377 --> 00:50:23,298
You can also do stuff with the lighting and the geometry so that it looks totally different

910
00:50:23,758 --> 00:50:25,719
depending on which direction you're approaching it from.

911
00:50:26,039 --> 00:50:28,079
You can do subtle little things to make it all feel different.

912
00:50:28,919 --> 00:50:34,260
I think Halo is possibly a dangerous example to talk about because there are some parts

913
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:38,141
of the game which are beautifully bi-directional and there are other parts of the game where

914
00:50:38,161 --> 00:50:41,682
it's like, oh, you're making me walk through the same copy-pasted level again and again

915
00:50:41,702 --> 00:50:42,002
and again.

916
00:50:42,802 --> 00:50:46,865
And I think one of the important things to remember between Halo and Half-Life is the

917
00:50:46,905 --> 00:50:49,626
fact that Half-Life took seven years to make, I think, or something like that.

918
00:50:50,967 --> 00:50:53,048
So they probably had plenty of time to make lots of nice levels.

919
00:50:54,849 --> 00:50:55,129
Thank you.

920
00:50:58,191 --> 00:50:58,451
Hello.

921
00:50:58,791 --> 00:51:02,293
Um, about your bit on dynamic difficulty.

922
00:51:02,693 --> 00:51:02,833
Yes.

923
00:51:05,127 --> 00:51:12,292
brought in the fact that some games will hide special weapons or all sorts of little secrets

924
00:51:12,312 --> 00:51:15,774
for the player who wants to take the challenge further and search around.

925
00:51:17,395 --> 00:51:23,859
These players who are more willing to face more difficult challenges are most of the time

926
00:51:23,899 --> 00:51:29,503
rewarded with a weapon or an item that makes the game easier for them.

927
00:51:30,978 --> 00:51:36,662
How do you keep that balance without just making the game easier for those who have worked harder on it?

928
00:51:37,102 --> 00:51:42,046
I think you need to be cognizant of that when you design the reward for the risk.

929
00:51:43,326 --> 00:51:44,167
So, for example...

930
00:51:46,267 --> 00:51:52,009
If you put a big weapon in a game, you need to make sure there's a reason for that to be used.

931
00:51:52,369 --> 00:51:57,571
And if you want to put in an extra bit of risk-reward, it's important to balance it,

932
00:51:58,011 --> 00:52:00,132
so that it doesn't break the overall difficulty curve.

933
00:52:00,312 --> 00:52:05,414
And if you want to be really, really advanced to kind of fix, like to patch a problem,

934
00:52:05,934 --> 00:52:08,615
if you can dynamically up the...

935
00:52:11,549 --> 00:52:14,333
not the ferocity, but let's say the level of the competence

936
00:52:14,714 --> 00:52:18,239
that the player will face if he collects the rocket launcher, say, for example.

937
00:52:19,761 --> 00:52:19,982
Thank you.

938
00:52:20,643 --> 00:52:23,487
I've completely failed to repeat people's questions. I do apologize for that.

939
00:52:23,608 --> 00:52:25,250
I'll try and do that with this one.

940
00:52:29,443 --> 00:52:33,184
Hi, yeah, so as the years go by, I've noticed that obviously

941
00:52:33,724 --> 00:52:37,605
games have been reaching a wider variety of audiences.

942
00:52:38,265 --> 00:52:41,085
And I have some friends that they are not really gamers,

943
00:52:41,205 --> 00:52:44,026
and they have started to play games, like recent games.

944
00:52:44,406 --> 00:52:46,686
And a lot of them get lost a lot in environments.

945
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:47,767
They don't know where to go.

946
00:52:47,807 --> 00:52:48,867
They don't know what to do sometimes.

947
00:52:48,927 --> 00:52:50,767
And for me, it seems completely intuitive.

948
00:52:50,807 --> 00:52:53,748
And people that do play games for years, they do.

949
00:52:54,248 --> 00:52:56,468
So I think maybe some people, they

950
00:52:57,289 --> 00:52:59,811
it's harder for them to understand maybe what to do

951
00:53:00,151 --> 00:53:01,412
in certain types of level design.

952
00:53:01,772 --> 00:53:03,273
Do you think that because of this,

953
00:53:03,833 --> 00:53:06,175
and since games are becoming so big

954
00:53:06,235 --> 00:53:07,956
and lots more people are playing them,

955
00:53:08,557 --> 00:53:10,298
is level design changing the way,

956
00:53:10,518 --> 00:53:14,100
like are level designers working to make a different,

957
00:53:15,001 --> 00:53:17,043
yeah, to be easier for more people

958
00:53:17,063 --> 00:53:18,203
to understand what's going on?

959
00:53:18,724 --> 00:53:21,426
Or is it just like people just need to adapt?

960
00:53:21,486 --> 00:53:23,727
I don't know, do you think that is happening?

961
00:53:23,827 --> 00:53:24,428
Is that an issue?

962
00:53:24,608 --> 00:53:25,630
That's an interesting question.

963
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:28,274
So if I understand correctly, you're asking me if level

964
00:53:28,294 --> 00:53:31,099
design is being dumbed down to accommodate a broader

965
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:33,764
audience of players who aren't necessarily familiar with the

966
00:53:33,844 --> 00:53:36,228
visual tropes to guide people through levels?

967
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:38,311
I think it is, too.

968
00:53:39,017 --> 00:53:43,420
to a certain extent, but it depends on the type of game you're playing.

969
00:53:44,181 --> 00:53:47,583
A good example of this is the first Bioshock, which had that little compass,

970
00:53:48,063 --> 00:53:51,726
which would always point you exactly where in the direction you're supposed to go.

971
00:53:51,746 --> 00:53:54,528
And the first thing I did was turn it off, because it was annoying.

972
00:53:55,509 --> 00:53:58,271
But I imagine it was probably quite helpful for a lot of players

973
00:53:58,291 --> 00:54:01,413
who weren't familiar with navigating a 3D space.

974
00:54:01,994 --> 00:54:03,615
When we put Medal of Honor together,

975
00:54:04,315 --> 00:54:06,517
the navigability of the levels was a really big problem.

976
00:54:08,395 --> 00:54:12,135
We had signposts pointing in the right direction.

977
00:54:12,155 --> 00:54:15,036
You always had to go towards red objects.

978
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:19,977
You had compass markers, your little compass, which

979
00:54:19,997 --> 00:54:21,517
would point you in the direction you had to go.

980
00:54:21,537 --> 00:54:24,198
You had a big arrow on the screen that told you where to go.

981
00:54:25,098 --> 00:54:26,998
The soldiers would lead you through the level.

982
00:54:27,279 --> 00:54:30,479
So they'd always leapfrog over you to guide you through the level.

983
00:54:30,499 --> 00:54:31,619
People still didn't know where to go.

984
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:35,100
So it's quite a complex problem.

985
00:54:37,290 --> 00:54:41,852
And aside from doing the dead space or perfect dark trick

986
00:54:41,872 --> 00:54:45,754
of actually pinging on the floor and showing the player

987
00:54:45,774 --> 00:54:47,295
exactly where to go, there's no way

988
00:54:47,335 --> 00:54:50,336
that you can really explicitly direct the player somewhere

989
00:54:50,356 --> 00:54:52,257
without breaking some of the immersion, I think.

990
00:54:53,637 --> 00:54:55,018
So again, it's about finding a balance.

991
00:54:55,038 --> 00:54:56,118
That's not really a great answer,

992
00:54:56,138 --> 00:54:57,739
but hopefully that's OK.

993
00:54:58,560 --> 00:54:58,980
OK, thank you.

994
00:55:01,601 --> 00:55:03,502
Common problem that I see in game design

995
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:05,963
is whenever you're about to battle a boss,

996
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:09,612
I thought, he's talking without moving his lips, that's brilliant.

997
00:55:10,693 --> 00:55:14,038
Sorry, um, but whenever I'm about to fight a boss,

998
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:17,262
you mentioned the surprise element in level design,

999
00:55:17,843 --> 00:55:20,066
but I find that I always know a boss is coming

1000
00:55:20,086 --> 00:55:21,848
because I enter a room that's just full of ammunition.

1001
00:55:22,526 --> 00:55:24,588
And I imagine that you have to combat that because like,

1002
00:55:25,588 --> 00:55:27,810
I'm the kind of guy that's gonna just burn through my grenades

1003
00:55:28,631 --> 00:55:31,713
and then I find the boss and I'm like, crap, I should have saved the grenades.

1004
00:55:31,753 --> 00:55:34,395
And so you're kind of combating against numbskulls,

1005
00:55:34,475 --> 00:55:37,758
but also destroying that surprise element.

1006
00:55:37,778 --> 00:55:38,358
Does that make sense?

1007
00:55:38,813 --> 00:55:44,775
Yeah, so that's interesting. I think what you've got there is what I like to refer to as the designer's curse.

1008
00:55:45,135 --> 00:55:49,637
So you're so familiar with the mechanics and the setup of the levels and level design

1009
00:55:50,177 --> 00:55:52,798
that you know exactly what's coming. You can preempt it.

1010
00:55:53,138 --> 00:55:54,759
I have this problem when I'm playing shooters.

1011
00:55:55,859 --> 00:55:58,680
Whenever I walk into a room that's full of boxes that come up to about here,

1012
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:03,061
it's like, yeah, okay, there's lots of cover in this room, so people are going to pile in through the doors at the end.

1013
00:56:03,961 --> 00:56:06,742
So it puts me in a very different mindset to somebody who just be like,

1014
00:56:06,782 --> 00:56:07,743
ooh, look, crates, that's nice.

1015
00:56:09,165 --> 00:56:13,429
So yeah, I think it's difficult to design around that.

1016
00:56:13,809 --> 00:56:16,632
It almost feels like the opposite problem

1017
00:56:17,873 --> 00:56:19,214
from the previous question, where

1018
00:56:19,614 --> 00:56:22,697
you've got such a preloaded knowledge that you

1019
00:56:22,737 --> 00:56:24,338
can anticipate what's going on.

1020
00:56:24,398 --> 00:56:27,380
And that's why it's really important to disrupt

1021
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:31,083
that kind of standard paradigm and the pacing and the layout.

1022
00:56:32,824 --> 00:56:41,928
I wouldn't be able to give you a specific example of a boss fight that comes out of nowhere apart from that day of sex example that Thomas Grip gave where you sneak around and then suddenly there's a cutscene.

1023
00:56:42,828 --> 00:56:45,289
But that's probably a bad example, so I'll stop there.

1024
00:56:46,090 --> 00:56:47,190
Does that answer your question?

1025
00:56:47,790 --> 00:56:49,371
A bit, yeah. Thank you.

1026
00:56:51,672 --> 00:56:57,994
Hi, I was recently talking to someone at a bigger studio and they were saying a lot of their setups were driven by...

1027
00:56:59,078 --> 00:57:01,639
playtesting and the feedback they were getting.

1028
00:57:01,699 --> 00:57:04,859
So testers would score it based on how fun it was.

1029
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,880
And a lot of the design was being changed around

1030
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,021
because they were getting higher scores in certain setups.

1031
00:57:12,941 --> 00:57:14,381
So they were taking out puzzles and whatnot.

1032
00:57:15,721 --> 00:57:18,062
And so I feel like it could have potentially

1033
00:57:18,842 --> 00:57:21,362
taken away from the original creative direction.

1034
00:57:22,102 --> 00:57:23,003
What's your take on that?

1035
00:57:24,403 --> 00:57:26,243
So you're asking if.

1036
00:57:28,157 --> 00:57:30,279
consistently playtesting and updating your game

1037
00:57:30,659 --> 00:57:32,641
takes away from the initial creative vision

1038
00:57:33,162 --> 00:57:33,962
that you had in mind.

1039
00:57:34,183 --> 00:57:36,665
So this is an interesting personal point for me,

1040
00:57:36,725 --> 00:57:39,587
because whilst I think it's super, super crucial

1041
00:57:39,928 --> 00:57:41,249
to play through your levels,

1042
00:57:41,549 --> 00:57:45,172
in fact, I like in level design to...

1043
00:57:46,974 --> 00:57:48,675
Hang on. Is it level design or playing level design?

1044
00:57:51,656 --> 00:57:53,477
I like level design to having a kitchen.

1045
00:57:54,417 --> 00:57:55,438
Your level is like your kitchen.

1046
00:57:55,818 --> 00:57:59,740
When you're in your own level, you know exactly where the knives and the forks and the spatulas and the spoons are.

1047
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:01,861
But when you cook in somebody else's kitchen,

1048
00:58:02,782 --> 00:58:04,542
it is quite stressful because you're like,

1049
00:58:04,582 --> 00:58:06,863
which drawer are the spoons in? I don't know where the pots are, what's going on?

1050
00:58:07,204 --> 00:58:11,926
And I think you've always got to bear in mind that the player is going to be cooking in your kitchen.

1051
00:58:13,352 --> 00:58:16,414
So you've got to do the best to make your kitchen

1052
00:58:16,974 --> 00:58:19,757
kind of conform to a standard layout

1053
00:58:19,797 --> 00:58:21,678
and not put your cutlery in the bottom drawer,

1054
00:58:21,698 --> 00:58:23,159
because that's weird.

1055
00:58:25,261 --> 00:58:30,385
But this always reminds me of this great Alan Moore quote,

1056
00:58:31,346 --> 00:58:33,347
who says that you shouldn't listen

1057
00:58:33,387 --> 00:58:35,729
to what anyone says about your design or your critics.

1058
00:58:37,391 --> 00:58:39,312
You need to be your critic.

1059
00:58:39,927 --> 00:58:43,347
You need some, because you know when you make something, you know how good or how bad it is.

1060
00:58:44,007 --> 00:58:51,229
So as long as you approach your initial vision with a really well-balanced type of self-criticism,

1061
00:58:51,809 --> 00:58:57,070
you should be able to accommodate the feedback you get and filter it out accordingly.

1062
00:58:58,031 --> 00:58:59,931
I think I've got time for two more questions.

1063
00:59:01,191 --> 00:59:02,132
Two minutes, two minutes left.

1064
00:59:04,314 --> 00:59:08,718
I'm curious, out of your entire career, all the levels you designed, what is the one that

1065
00:59:08,738 --> 00:59:11,159
you're the most proud of or felt was the most successful?

1066
00:59:14,502 --> 00:59:19,606
My favorite level that I've designed is the opening level to Medal of Honor Heroes 2,

1067
00:59:21,668 --> 00:59:28,393
because it's the tutorial level and it was a very early FPS on Wii, and so we had this

1068
00:59:28,473 --> 00:59:29,113
mandate to...

1069
00:59:30,443 --> 00:59:33,166
really clearly teach the player

1070
00:59:33,586 --> 00:59:37,390
the kind of crazy new motion controls of the Wii.

1071
00:59:38,892 --> 00:59:41,314
But we didn't want to make it like a boring tutorial

1072
00:59:41,514 --> 00:59:44,577
because it interrupts the flow of the level and it's very dull.

1073
00:59:47,238 --> 00:59:48,919
we actually managed to create something that

1074
00:59:49,339 --> 00:59:53,042
kind of captured the spirit of the Normandy beach landings from the original Medal of Honor.

1075
00:59:53,302 --> 00:59:55,323
But at the same time it was a tutorial.

1076
00:59:55,343 --> 00:59:59,206
So there were loads of explosions that didn't really have much of an effect on the player's health.

1077
00:59:59,566 --> 01:00:01,567
There were loads and loads of enemies,

1078
01:00:02,007 --> 01:00:05,650
but they'd shoot at your friends and not at you.

1079
01:00:06,010 --> 01:00:08,672
But if you moved past the enemies, the enemies would turn around and target you.

1080
01:00:08,692 --> 01:00:10,933
So it was a really nice tutorial.

1081
01:00:10,953 --> 01:00:12,634
It felt really exciting, it felt really intense.

1082
01:00:13,014 --> 01:00:15,996
But it also did a really good job of teaching the player the core mechanics.

1083
01:00:16,377 --> 01:00:19,959
and every section of the beach landing

1084
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:23,282
had been designed very, very deliberately

1085
01:00:23,722 --> 01:00:25,323
to introduce a new mechanic

1086
01:00:25,383 --> 01:00:26,765
and to teach the player how to use it.

1087
01:00:26,785 --> 01:00:29,266
So it was a lot of fun for me to work on as well.

1088
01:00:29,326 --> 01:00:30,407
So I was quite pleased with that.

1089
01:00:31,608 --> 01:00:33,450
Thank you. I'm going to have to check that out.

1090
01:00:33,490 --> 01:00:34,270
Yeah, I hope you enjoy it.

1091
01:00:43,877 --> 01:00:44,218
applause
