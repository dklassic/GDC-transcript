00:00:00,271 --> 00:00:02,332
Hi everyone, welcome to the GDC Twitch channel.

2
00:00:02,412 --> 00:00:05,313
My name is Bryant Francis, I am here again.

3
00:00:06,053 --> 00:00:08,675
Back after, I guess we've been away for at least a month, sorry about that.

4
00:00:09,315 --> 00:00:11,496
We are here today playing Slay the Spire.

5
00:00:11,976 --> 00:00:13,337
You probably know about this game.

6
00:00:13,997 --> 00:00:17,999
It's sold only a couple million copies and it's topped the Steam charts consistently.

7
00:00:19,099 --> 00:00:20,580
It's been around for the last couple years.

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,600
I think it released in Early Access in 2017.

9
00:00:24,741 --> 00:00:26,702
But this year we are streaming it.

10
00:00:26,722 --> 00:00:29,303
Hey, you know, it's a good game. We like streaming good games.

11
00:00:29,323 --> 00:00:30,943
We like talking to the devs behind those games.

12
00:00:31,283 --> 00:00:37,045
But also, we are streaming it because this game has been nominated at the 2020 IGF Awards,

13
00:00:37,105 --> 00:00:40,046
which will take place at this year's Game Developers Conference.

14
00:00:40,586 --> 00:00:41,786
The date will be March 18th, 2020.

15
00:00:42,427 --> 00:00:45,768
You can see in the upper left-hand corner, this year's GDC dates.

16
00:00:47,588 --> 00:00:51,269
In the lower left-hand corner of the screen, I am joined by Casey Yano.

17
00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:52,069
Hello.

18
00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:53,010
Casey, how you doing?

19
00:00:53,994 --> 00:00:54,714
I'm doing great, thanks.

20
00:01:13,077 --> 00:01:16,559
Uh, as far as I know it's pronounced Shamus, but it's written like Sumas?

21
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:19,781
Um, if I get in trouble for that, oh well, that's on me.

22
00:01:19,821 --> 00:01:22,442
But every year I've been, you know, going to these awards for the last few years,

23
00:01:22,922 --> 00:01:24,583
and I hear it pronounced Shamus.

24
00:01:25,184 --> 00:01:29,786
Um, and you've also been nominated for the IGF Award for Excellence in Design,

25
00:01:29,846 --> 00:01:33,168
which, as far as that design goes, we are seeing it on screen right now.

26
00:01:33,568 --> 00:01:39,950
For those of you who don't know, Slay the Spire is a roguelike deck building game where you take this hero on a roguelike adventure

27
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:45,671
using cards that you acquire through your adventure to build your deck and create unique strategies that change on every run.

28
00:01:48,492 --> 00:01:52,673
Just looking over a chat real quick, I can give a quick shoutout to VVSPA who says,

29
00:01:52,853 --> 00:01:56,433
Yo Casey, so I think that's a friend of yours, I hope it's a friend of yours.

30
00:01:56,454 --> 00:01:58,654
Oh yeah, definitely, I know them very well.

31
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:04,173
For the folks in chat, we want to hear from you as we talk with Casey today.

32
00:02:05,214 --> 00:02:09,897
We are taking your questions, we are going to be chatting about how Slay of the Spire got made,

33
00:02:09,937 --> 00:02:15,441
and you will have the opportunity to just put them in chat, I'll grab them, and we will talk to Casey about what you want to know.

34
00:02:16,822 --> 00:02:20,084
Casey, like I said, Slay the Spire has been out for a little bit,

35
00:02:21,164 --> 00:02:24,445
and this is the first year you all were nominated for an IGF award.

36
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:30,008
I guess, how does it feel? How does it feel to be nominated by, you know, your fellow developers?

37
00:02:30,188 --> 00:02:32,429
Or, I guess you submit yourself, I guess developers submit themselves.

38
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:35,590
How does it feel? How does it feel to be chosen for this nomination?

39
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,011
Oh, I mean, it's very exciting.

40
00:02:39,272 --> 00:02:45,394
I mean, I think IGF was like, maybe one of the first award shows that I was like, kind of like, aware of.

41
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:47,667
That's kind of how I discovered a bunch of indie games.

42
00:02:48,087 --> 00:02:50,129
Because it was, you know, indie game centric, right?

43
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,452
Um, and so in that same vein, I was kind of like,

44
00:02:53,672 --> 00:02:56,375
like, wow, like, it's like, it's like the independent one.

45
00:02:56,615 --> 00:02:58,116
I guess because I'm making an indie game,

46
00:02:58,316 --> 00:02:59,818
it means to me that it's like,

47
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:02,039
a nomination for an indie game versus,

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,462
um, like, just games in general.

49
00:03:05,442 --> 00:03:06,904
Now Slay the Spire has been out, uh,

50
00:03:06,924 --> 00:03:09,706
it was going through Steam Early Access since, uh, 2017,

51
00:03:09,826 --> 00:03:11,708
but it was nominated this year because you all, like,

52
00:03:11,868 --> 00:03:13,009
officially released the game, right?

53
00:03:13,948 --> 00:03:17,331
Yeah, I think we also just forgot to submit it the year before.

54
00:03:17,351 --> 00:03:17,951
Yeah.

55
00:03:18,511 --> 00:03:22,914
I do remember reading the guidelines saying that you are able to submit a game even if it's not,

56
00:03:23,674 --> 00:03:26,956
um, like, complete-complete, but like playable all the way from start to finish.

57
00:03:26,976 --> 00:03:30,238
Um, but I just, I guess we just missed the deadline, I think, uh...

58
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,132
Early Access is pretty hectic, I think. At least for our schedule.

59
00:03:34,312 --> 00:03:40,514
Yeah. We can dive into Early Access. I guess, like I said, this is kind of an interesting

60
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:44,656
situation because you all have been out for a while. But I guess, let's go back to the

61
00:03:44,676 --> 00:03:49,958
days of Steam Early Access. Why did you go with Early Access and not kind of just decide,

62
00:03:49,998 --> 00:03:52,779
hey, we're going to release, we're going to work on this until it's done and then release it?

63
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,020
I would say that there was like...

64
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,772
a very large potential amount of features that we could have added to the game, but

65
00:04:00,812 --> 00:04:05,253
it's also like, how much, how, is it worth it to add all of these extra features?

66
00:04:06,874 --> 00:04:11,256
And so we were like, maybe we can get, you know, we can gauge how popular the game is,

67
00:04:12,196 --> 00:04:15,997
and if it does well, we'll add some of these extra features and more content, and if not,

68
00:04:16,037 --> 00:04:18,878
maybe we can cut it a bit short, and then, you know, we'll call it a day.

69
00:04:18,898 --> 00:04:20,319
The project.

70
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,381
So I guess that's kind of why we released the game.

71
00:04:26,197 --> 00:04:30,820
with two of the characters complete out of three that we were initially planning on and that way we

72
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,143
could have been able to be like oh like this is working on two and then we're gonna finish the

73
00:04:35,163 --> 00:04:39,686
third one and then once we're content complete you know it's like then we'll just say like this

74
00:04:39,706 --> 00:04:45,269
is it like this is good like like people will maybe be happy that we make another game instead

75
00:04:45,289 --> 00:04:49,692
of like adding more on you know a game that maybe you know wasn't really popular but

76
00:04:50,584 --> 00:04:51,824
Wow, these are a lot different.

77
00:05:20,719 --> 00:05:25,262
That process was, it was a lot of work.

78
00:05:26,102 --> 00:05:33,587
Mostly it was a huge scramble in the beginning, mainly because we had, what was it?

79
00:05:33,707 --> 00:05:35,087
We were missing localization.

80
00:05:35,107 --> 00:05:37,929
I guess it depends on how early we're talking about.

81
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:42,772
In the very, very beginning, we were just kind of like making hotfixes, and then we

82
00:05:42,812 --> 00:05:44,813
were like playing around with balance very quietly.

83
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:49,896
And then we were like, what are we supposed to do once we're out of early access?

84
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:56,000
And so we looked at a bunch of other games, and then we were looking at our pace based

85
00:05:56,140 --> 00:06:02,483
on how much players we had, which I think in the first week or so we had about maybe

86
00:06:03,023 --> 00:06:07,325
like 2,000 to 5,000 players, which I don't know if it was a lot or not.

87
00:06:07,385 --> 00:06:12,748
But at our Discord, we had a Discord server, and we had maybe like five active people.

88
00:06:14,028 --> 00:06:15,709
And so we were like, hey, we're going to update the game.

89
00:06:15,989 --> 00:06:17,850
We're just going to update it whenever, whatever.

90
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,091
And that was going to be great because...

91
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:26,980
It's just a very casual exchange between updating the game and then people telling us what they think.

92
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,161
Like a very small handful of people telling us what they think about it.

93
00:06:30,521 --> 00:06:32,161
And then we're like, oh, maybe we'll work on those things.

94
00:06:32,401 --> 00:06:35,442
And that's actually what we did before Early Access as well.

95
00:06:35,622 --> 00:06:39,802
Like, just like we had a private channel, we had our friends, and then they would give us feedback.

96
00:06:40,623 --> 00:06:41,863
And then we would just make those changes.

97
00:06:42,043 --> 00:06:45,003
And so we would update almost every day when it was private.

98
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:49,104
And so when we hit Early Access, we were like, oh, we'll just update once a week.

99
00:06:49,772 --> 00:06:53,875
And so we just decided that it would be like this one week update release cadence.

100
00:06:55,576 --> 00:07:01,220
And then it got bigger and then the bigger it got, the harder it got to do the one week release.

101
00:07:01,961 --> 00:07:05,603
Because there was just so much more bugs to filter through, so much more feedback to filter through.

102
00:07:06,544 --> 00:07:10,847
And I guess that's kind of like the strange momentum that we rode throughout almost all of Early Access.

103
00:07:12,403 --> 00:07:21,889
That's so interesting. I'm guessing, and it sounds like that was the case, because with more people giving feedback, you just found more things that you needed to work on and that just stretched out the time between updates.

104
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:34,538
We actually kept up with the weekly updates for a very, very long time. It was too much. But now it's kind of done. Kind of.

105
00:07:34,558 --> 00:07:38,140
I'm going to swing over to my question pile.

106
00:07:40,577 --> 00:07:43,719
How do you think, I'm going to ask one more question about Early Access before I move on.

107
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:48,262
How do you think Early Access, like it's, you know, Early Access is sort of an interesting

108
00:07:48,282 --> 00:07:52,425
feature because it helps developers, like I said, build that audience, start getting

109
00:07:52,465 --> 00:07:56,568
feedback on their game early, and sort of solve problems in a different way that they

110
00:07:56,588 --> 00:07:58,870
couldn't solve if they were just trying to release a finished product.

111
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:03,793
But how do you think that going through Steam Early Access influenced your creative vision

112
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:04,814
and your design for the game?

113
00:08:05,854 --> 00:08:12,475
Because Slay the Spire is this really cool, like, the deck building approach, the cost, the way these mechanics sort of loop together.

114
00:08:13,315 --> 00:08:20,897
Obviously, there's some of these ideas, the ones you had at the start, but like, what do you think came out of your community-focused design approach that comes with Early Access?

115
00:08:22,157 --> 00:08:24,937
Hmm. Let's see. That's a good question.

116
00:08:24,957 --> 00:08:27,778
I think definitely it shaped our content design.

117
00:08:29,338 --> 00:08:34,559
I think we shipped not with 75 cards, but like 70 or so, and we were just like adding a few or reworking a bunch.

118
00:08:35,642 --> 00:08:40,404
and you kind of start to get a feel for what kind of things are popular or not popular.

119
00:08:40,424 --> 00:08:45,626
I mean to this to this day I think some of the cards may not be the most popular,

120
00:08:47,046 --> 00:08:51,848
but at least like you'll be able to know what is and is not over time and then of course

121
00:08:52,768 --> 00:08:58,351
at least we collect data not like I think we have like checkbox but we have gameplay data

122
00:08:58,391 --> 00:09:02,872
that's uploaded and then we can make balance changes very quickly and we can kind of test

123
00:09:03,253 --> 00:09:05,173
out a bunch of other like strange things.

124
00:09:05,997 --> 00:09:10,238
I think when we started working on the game, it was kind of more on the serious side.

125
00:09:11,178 --> 00:09:15,059
And then I started adding kind of like strange jokes and like very bizarre creatures.

126
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,640
Those were like very positive.

127
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,681
But we also didn't want to like go overboard.

128
00:09:20,701 --> 00:09:21,982
It's like a very jokey game.

129
00:09:22,222 --> 00:09:26,423
I mean, depending on who you ask, it is or is not like super jokey.

130
00:09:27,403 --> 00:09:30,864
So we kind of have like this very serious facade, but like there's all this weird stuff

131
00:09:30,884 --> 00:09:31,705
that happens in the game.

132
00:09:32,645 --> 00:09:33,365
Because I don't know.

133
00:09:33,725 --> 00:09:35,386
That's just kind of what we.

134
00:09:35,911 --> 00:09:37,732
figure out works for us and our game.

135
00:09:39,232 --> 00:09:40,753
Um, and maybe it has to do with the art style.

136
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:44,174
Maybe it has to do with my strange writing in the game.

137
00:09:45,295 --> 00:09:51,077
Maybe we should have hired a writer, but so I guess those kinds of

138
00:09:51,097 --> 00:09:52,398
things are heavily influenced.

139
00:09:52,818 --> 00:09:55,399
Um, choices that didn't feel meaningful.

140
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:59,861
You know, we kind of try to update and I guess, yeah, we uploaded

141
00:09:59,961 --> 00:10:01,162
and updated a bunch of things.

142
00:10:02,422 --> 00:10:02,642
Yeah.

143
00:10:03,723 --> 00:10:06,364
And we just have more and more questions when people play.

144
00:10:06,844 --> 00:10:08,125
And questions people have.

145
00:10:08,925 --> 00:10:11,567
The more we even change up, like, what kind of metrics we gather,

146
00:10:11,687 --> 00:10:13,228
so we can make meaningful changes.

147
00:10:13,248 --> 00:10:18,790
A very good example is, like, when people pick a card, we know...

148
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:22,872
So we get information on what cards people chose over what other cards they chose.

149
00:10:22,892 --> 00:10:28,875
That way we can gauge, like, a preference of what card they choose.

150
00:10:29,175 --> 00:10:32,957
And this is sorted on, like, difficulty, and, like, where in the game you are.

151
00:10:34,179 --> 00:10:37,401
Um, and so we have that kind of information on top of like the win rate.

152
00:10:37,702 --> 00:10:42,004
And so every card kind of has like, like a, how fun is it value?

153
00:10:42,405 --> 00:10:43,906
And like, good, is it value?

154
00:10:44,086 --> 00:10:49,269
And we try to, I think we have realized that a perfectly balanced game may not

155
00:10:49,329 --> 00:10:51,831
actually be like the funnest of games to play.

156
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:56,074
And so I guess that's like one, one thing out of all the.

157
00:10:56,506 --> 00:11:03,969
Yeah, what's a good example of a card in Sleight of the Spire that is really good but not really fun, or really fun but not really good?

158
00:11:04,009 --> 00:11:06,510
I guess I'm curious, like, what kind of examples you've encountered.

159
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:10,051
I see. We have a lot of straightforward defense cards.

160
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:17,774
And I think there are definitely personalities where people just want to, like, just, like, increase your numbers exponentially.

161
00:11:17,794 --> 00:11:24,256
So there are cards that will, like, double, like, your strength, which is a very basic example of, like, a card that's, like,

162
00:11:25,038 --> 00:11:28,141
that looks like it has a lot of potential, but if you don't understand the game fully,

163
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:34,445
a card for instance that will double or slowly ramp up your strength throughout a whole combat

164
00:11:34,725 --> 00:11:37,948
is actually, to balance this, they have very high costs.

165
00:11:38,388 --> 00:11:42,491
And I think a lot of new players choose them without consequence, and they end up dying

166
00:11:42,551 --> 00:11:43,211
pretty frequently.

167
00:11:44,132 --> 00:11:49,556
But those are high potential cards that people love, whereas more simple cards like game

168
00:11:49,596 --> 00:11:54,459
block drop, oh we just saw it, I think you just chose it in the stream here, just shrug

169
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:54,700
it off.

170
00:11:55,392 --> 00:11:56,653
It's like your game block, your draw card.

171
00:11:56,753 --> 00:11:59,454
And it's very hard to see why that's useful

172
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,716
if you haven't played too many deck building games.

173
00:12:03,576 --> 00:12:07,518
It's like pretty boring, but also very core.

174
00:12:08,238 --> 00:12:10,239
If everything is wacky, nothing really comes together.

175
00:12:10,539 --> 00:12:14,581
So the cards that are a base are generally not popular at first,

176
00:12:15,141 --> 00:12:18,303
but I think people start to understand how to play the game pretty well.

177
00:12:18,843 --> 00:12:19,783
And then they see the value.

178
00:12:20,304 --> 00:12:21,864
And seeing that value is so fun!

179
00:12:21,884 --> 00:12:23,885
It's like learning the game!

180
00:12:24,907 --> 00:12:28,271
Oh my god, actually, Shrug It Off, funny you mentioned it, we're gonna see in this run that we're doing.

181
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:34,079
Shrug It Off became one of my favorite cards, uh, because I would mix, um, Shrug It Off with, uh, Body Slam.

182
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:40,948
I upgraded Body Slam to be zero, to cost zero, and the combo would be Shrug It Off, Body Slam, uh...

183
00:12:41,468 --> 00:12:46,232
Which would just cycle through it both kept my armor up and you know, let me kill really quickly, which I was so

184
00:12:46,252 --> 00:12:51,136
I just was playing this yesterday and I was like, oh, I'm in trouble like I'm sucked in

185
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:56,020
Let's see, um

186
00:12:56,101 --> 00:12:57,242
moving on to

187
00:12:58,563 --> 00:13:05,809
Another design question. I have I'm really fascinated by how this game uses punishment and curses because I hit a point yesterday where

188
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:13,859
Whenever the game would present me like, like we just saw the Golden Idol opportunity, you know, uh, take this, get a relic, gain a curse, um,

189
00:13:14,499 --> 00:13:17,363
there was a brief moment where I, you know, was trying to weigh the cost-benefit and then

190
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:20,107
midway through the run I began to realize

191
00:13:21,308 --> 00:13:23,030
um, curses may

192
00:13:24,092 --> 00:13:24,352
make it

193
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,941
Harder to do, like you can see the injury that just pops up right now.

194
00:13:28,502 --> 00:13:34,645
Curses make those moments harder, but overall engaging with them makes a run more fun.

195
00:13:35,926 --> 00:13:37,487
That was sort of a decision I realized yesterday.

196
00:13:37,527 --> 00:13:43,010
I basically said yes to every curse that came my way because whatever positive thing came with it invariably helped me out.

197
00:13:44,551 --> 00:13:49,814
What was kind of your, I thought that was a little bit different than how roguelikes handle this sort of thing.

198
00:13:50,094 --> 00:13:53,636
Could you explain your design thought on those kind of negative, you know, those negative trade-offs?

199
00:13:55,331 --> 00:13:56,512
Oh, like negative trade offs for games?

200
00:13:56,532 --> 00:13:57,232
Yeah.

201
00:13:57,252 --> 00:13:58,093
And rogue links, I guess?

202
00:13:58,113 --> 00:14:00,114
Yeah, when we're in this game, yeah.

203
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:07,598
I think we mostly want decisions to be based on, like, what is your current situation?

204
00:14:07,618 --> 00:14:08,898
Mhm.

205
00:14:09,178 --> 00:14:11,940
Versus, like, something that is good and you get something bad.

206
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,602
Why I say that is because you can make a deck that is very resilient to curses.

207
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:21,425
There's like an obvious example where if there's a relic that gives you strength, if you have curses.

208
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:22,625
But I'm not gonna use that example.

209
00:14:23,444 --> 00:14:29,328
But because it's a deck-building game, if you're making a very, very large deck, like you're just getting a lot of cards,

210
00:14:30,248 --> 00:14:34,811
if you think a lot about it, the strikes and defends are kind of like curses in and of themselves,

211
00:14:35,091 --> 00:14:40,775
because they're kind of low-value cards, and that's on purpose because we want to encourage people to try out new cards

212
00:14:40,835 --> 00:14:44,277
so they can discover more of the intricate mechanics of the game.

213
00:14:45,438 --> 00:14:52,022
And curses are kind of like in that same vein, in that like, you're like, oh, this curse gives you vulnerable, but there's a relic that can make you.

214
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:53,813
You know, maybe not vulnerable.

215
00:14:55,074 --> 00:14:56,775
Or there's a curse.

216
00:14:57,355 --> 00:15:00,417
You know, like, the curse doesn't matter too much if you're drawing a lot of cards.

217
00:15:01,757 --> 00:15:05,239
And in the end, you know, if you draw five cards, but if you draw two of them as curses,

218
00:15:05,719 --> 00:15:09,622
that's like, your opportunity in that one turn is so terrible, right?

219
00:15:10,082 --> 00:15:14,624
You pretty much, since the average cost of a card is generally like one or one point, you know,

220
00:15:14,824 --> 00:15:19,127
slightly higher than one, like, you're just, you're chosen to just play three of those cards that you drew.

221
00:15:19,887 --> 00:15:20,828
And that's like, really bad.

222
00:15:21,463 --> 00:15:26,845
And so I guess in that way, we noticed that most of the curses, at first we had some other

223
00:15:27,466 --> 00:15:33,428
negative traits like losing max HP or losing gold or some other random stuff.

224
00:15:33,688 --> 00:15:38,249
But I think in general we discovered that negative things that you can interact with

225
00:15:38,549 --> 00:15:41,090
and have control over, especially cards.

226
00:15:41,971 --> 00:15:44,812
So I guess curses in that way are a good example.

227
00:15:45,332 --> 00:15:47,413
Some people still don't like them, that's fine, you know.

228
00:15:47,933 --> 00:15:49,653
Maybe there'll be another better solution.

229
00:15:52,214 --> 00:15:53,074
That's a really good answer.

230
00:15:53,614 --> 00:15:56,015
Moving on to another part of the game's design.

231
00:15:57,096 --> 00:16:04,099
This fight was really interesting because the way the attack curse swap off here worked.

232
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:09,282
I sort of felt in these days that slip into my deck, I was so fascinated by how...

233
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:16,678
Like the 2-1 alternate here, you know, two cursors, one attacker, and then two attackers, one cursor.

234
00:16:16,698 --> 00:16:19,782
Something about that just, like, made this fight really hard to think through,

235
00:16:19,802 --> 00:16:22,926
especially as it added more of those exhausts to my deck.

236
00:16:25,383 --> 00:16:33,089
Going to kind of a broader level about design in the metagame with the map, I've got the

237
00:16:33,109 --> 00:16:38,673
interview up that a friend of GDC, a friend of Gamasutra, Joel Couture did with your partner

238
00:16:38,933 --> 00:16:40,575
Anthony Giovannetti.

239
00:16:40,595 --> 00:16:41,635
Cool, I got the name right.

240
00:16:42,696 --> 00:16:51,360
We got his interview with Anthony here and he talks about how the map that the player uses to navigate the quote-unquote spire

241
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,261
was inspired by FTL and how it was valuable to have

242
00:16:54,862 --> 00:16:57,643
layered decision-making to add an element of risk-reward.

243
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:01,805
Could you talk about the map process from your end and what you sort of thought worked really well about it?

244
00:17:03,305 --> 00:17:03,646
Hmm

245
00:17:05,146 --> 00:17:09,368
The map process. The process for making the map. I'm sorry. Also making the map. Yeah

246
00:17:10,289 --> 00:17:10,589
Let's see.

247
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:16,407
I think we wanted breaks from combat.

248
00:17:17,568 --> 00:17:22,071
And then we also wanted intense ups and downs, right?

249
00:17:22,151 --> 00:17:27,556
Because we didn't want you to feel too comfortable, but we also wanted reprieve.

250
00:17:28,096 --> 00:17:32,139
So it's kind of like, you're going, you get minor heals, you get stronger, you get minor

251
00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:32,500
heals.

252
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,802
And then so there's a composition that we wanted to aim for.

253
00:17:36,643 --> 00:17:40,226
And there are some explicit decisions too, like the very first.

254
00:17:40,885 --> 00:17:47,087
room is always a monster room in each act and then you know the very last one right before the boss

255
00:17:47,447 --> 00:17:53,170
is a campsite um and in the center there's always i don't remember exactly which row like maybe like

256
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:59,512
row seven or so of each act is always a treasure room so and those used to be more random like it

257
00:17:59,572 --> 00:18:05,515
used to be kind of like a mixed bag that is more exploratory but it actually the closer each path

258
00:18:05,555 --> 00:18:10,517
was with slight differences the more meaningful like it was actually harder decisions um when it

259
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:16,205
purely random, not like completely random, but much more random. It was very clear what

260
00:18:16,225 --> 00:18:21,909
like the best path was because generally people would weigh an event over an elite and things

261
00:18:21,949 --> 00:18:30,436
like that. So I guess, I guess the lessons learned was, everything is really random.

262
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:33,358
You actually have less choice when creating the map.

263
00:18:36,137 --> 00:18:42,259
more rows, uh not more rows, more columns. So we had more and more paths but we actually reduced

264
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:48,222
those numbers and reduced the height of the entire level a bit but that's mostly probably because of

265
00:18:48,262 --> 00:18:53,845
game length. I think we felt like the game was kind of like going on too long or like the deck

266
00:18:53,865 --> 00:18:59,927
was becoming too like perfect by the end. Yeah. So we were like trimming it shorter and shorter until

267
00:19:00,488 --> 00:19:04,730
we were getting it perfect in which like you felt overpowered just before the boss or like you were

268
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,205
When you say, like, oh, I was almost, like, invincible, like, that's, like, a good feeling,

269
00:19:10,405 --> 00:19:13,829
or, like, perfectly become invincible based on the difficulty that you're playing.

270
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:17,473
And so, I guess that's, like, the balancing act of...

271
00:19:18,189 --> 00:19:19,629
creating a map that we discovered.

272
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:22,210
And that was a lot of testing.

273
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:24,911
We changed the map many, many, many times.

274
00:19:25,191 --> 00:19:27,711
Yeah. How did you feel when you sort of hit that point,

275
00:19:28,451 --> 00:19:31,872
when your original design scheme called for a very random map,

276
00:19:32,452 --> 00:19:34,693
and then as you got further along, you realized,

277
00:19:34,793 --> 00:19:38,694
oh no, we need to actually tighten this map and take more control over it.

278
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:43,235
Randomization actually leads to less choice-making, I guess,

279
00:19:43,275 --> 00:19:44,995
but authorship means more choice-making.

280
00:19:45,035 --> 00:19:47,736
It's a very inverse relationship between those two things.

281
00:19:49,036 --> 00:19:51,718
Here we go. Here's Bodyslam, my favorite card.

282
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,720
Let's see. That's a good question.

283
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,922
We... Our design document is not very big.

284
00:20:00,942 --> 00:20:02,923
To put it simply.

285
00:20:04,284 --> 00:20:09,447
I don't know why, but Anthony and I are very, very on the same page of design.

286
00:20:09,467 --> 00:20:14,669
I think it's because whenever we see an interesting game design-wise,

287
00:20:15,129 --> 00:20:16,450
we just play it together.

288
00:20:17,478 --> 00:20:21,141
I don't know, our design brains would kind of meld together in a strange way.

289
00:20:22,141 --> 00:20:23,442
And so when we were making the map,

290
00:20:24,563 --> 00:20:26,464
we were like, oh, what are we going to fight next?

291
00:20:26,544 --> 00:20:28,265
Are we going to have a monster or an event?

292
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:29,686
And then one day I would just be like,

293
00:20:30,447 --> 00:20:31,788
I don't remember if it was Anthony or myself.

294
00:20:32,008 --> 00:20:34,329
That's how vague it is, with design right now.

295
00:20:34,869 --> 00:20:36,811
It's just like, we need a map, right?

296
00:20:37,551 --> 00:20:42,114
We used to have these doors that showed up in the background after you defeat an enemy,

297
00:20:42,734 --> 00:20:45,156
and one of them was like another monster, another one was an event.

298
00:20:45,716 --> 00:20:46,377
And there was no map view.

299
00:20:47,731 --> 00:20:52,333
and you just choose different options until you reach a boss which is at a predetermined number.

300
00:20:52,353 --> 00:20:56,194
Like after you fight 10 enemies you're gonna fight a boss.

301
00:20:57,835 --> 00:21:01,236
But once you saw a map you could see ahead and kind of plan it out.

302
00:21:02,277 --> 00:21:06,098
And I remember one of our testers not liking that because if they saw all the way ahead

303
00:21:06,618 --> 00:21:11,981
they felt like the game was like analyzing the map rather than going through it.

304
00:21:12,141 --> 00:21:15,682
And so that's kind of like that's like a previous thing we just talked about

305
00:21:15,782 --> 00:21:17,403
which is about balancing it up but.

306
00:21:18,684 --> 00:21:21,687
Yeah I don't know, design wise, we just kinda try things.

307
00:21:23,408 --> 00:21:25,070
Almost nothing was set in stone in the beginning.

308
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:32,476
Right on, actually one thing I'll say about the map that I appreciate is when you're looking

309
00:21:32,496 --> 00:21:36,780
ahead and choosing a path it sort of affects, you sort of look ahead to affect what you

310
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:41,203
do right now, but then once you get sucked up in the combat, or once I get sucked up

311
00:21:41,404 --> 00:21:42,064
in the combat, I found...

312
00:21:46,028 --> 00:21:50,551
A lot of that planning got thrown out of my head, not out of a need to improvise or anything,

313
00:21:50,571 --> 00:21:53,814
but just out of like, oh, I forgot whatever active thing I was thinking about five minutes ago.

314
00:21:53,934 --> 00:21:56,996
You know, same way you walk through a room, you forget what you were thinking about in the other room.

315
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:01,480
And then I would make different micro-changes, you know, on the pa-

316
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,981
you know, your left-right branching right there.

317
00:22:03,442 --> 00:22:04,762
But, uh, when it came to...

318
00:22:04,842 --> 00:22:07,984
But, I still think it mattered that way back at the beginning of a run, you know,

319
00:22:08,024 --> 00:22:12,846
I decided to go up this route instead of that route, because, um, it, uh,

320
00:22:13,267 --> 00:22:14,928
it affected what long-term choices I had.

321
00:22:14,948 --> 00:22:17,269
So that's something I appreciate about the map existence.

322
00:22:17,629 --> 00:22:19,350
But, like, I was aiming for this treasure chest right here,

323
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:20,270
because I hit a point where I was like,

324
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:21,191
I like treasure chests!

325
00:22:21,671 --> 00:22:24,893
So I'm gonna make sure I chart that way, no matter what happens along the way.

326
00:22:27,049 --> 00:22:32,471
Let's see here, just giving a quick look around, just folks in chat, a reminder, I always worry

327
00:22:32,511 --> 00:22:36,473
I sound a bit desperate when I'm asking for questions from chat, but genuinely, we like

328
00:22:36,493 --> 00:22:41,035
your questions folks, we love hearing from you and sharing your questions with our guests,

329
00:22:41,175 --> 00:22:46,358
so if you've got them, share them, and if you don't, that's fine, I've got plenty to

330
00:22:46,478 --> 00:22:46,598
ask.

331
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:55,362
Casey, I'm going to step away from design for a moment and talk about this game's wonderful animation.

332
00:22:55,382 --> 00:22:58,443
Like, look at that word cackling and floating in there. Look at the way the text...

333
00:23:00,024 --> 00:23:03,625
Funny enough, that reminds me of Tyranny, which is the only other game I think...

334
00:23:04,346 --> 00:23:09,948
The only other major commercial game, because Twinedell developers actually do this all the time, and I just don't play enough of those games.

335
00:23:10,348 --> 00:23:10,748
But, um...

336
00:23:11,148 --> 00:23:12,109
What?

337
00:23:12,129 --> 00:23:12,269
Sorry?

338
00:23:13,369 --> 00:23:17,311
I was just shocked. I felt like wobbly text was like a huge deal in like indie games.

339
00:23:17,651 --> 00:23:21,313
Oh yeah, wobbly text is, but like the key emphasis on specific words.

340
00:23:22,614 --> 00:23:23,174
Oh, words.

341
00:23:23,294 --> 00:23:26,416
Like say Celeste is a game that has a lot of wobbly text,

342
00:23:26,816 --> 00:23:31,818
but you, Tyranny, and a few other games will actually like call out specific words.

343
00:23:32,359 --> 00:23:35,140
And Tyranny, they do a mouse highlight thing where you can...

344
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,721
I'm going to highlight over and get some extra text and do some really cool meta design stuff in that game.

345
00:23:41,422 --> 00:23:44,963
But even here, that's just text animation.

346
00:23:45,063 --> 00:23:49,584
The card animation, there's all these little animations that make this game...

347
00:23:49,924 --> 00:23:51,504
Again, I was sitting here playing this game and I went,

348
00:23:51,604 --> 00:23:53,605
oh no, I'm in trouble, I'm going to get sucked into this thing.

349
00:23:53,885 --> 00:23:55,625
And it was one half because of the design logic

350
00:23:55,665 --> 00:23:58,906
and the other half because everything just felt good to do with the animation.

351
00:23:59,686 --> 00:24:03,167
Would you be able to talk about your team's process for doing that?

352
00:24:04,027 --> 00:24:05,748
How you were able to do it with such a small team?

353
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:27,609
I

354
00:24:27,629 --> 00:24:27,769
can't

355
00:24:55,488 --> 00:25:00,191
because we don't want people getting frustrated about what is mysterious about the game while

356
00:25:00,211 --> 00:25:04,794
we're playing and have to leave or look it up because then it feels like research more

357
00:25:04,834 --> 00:25:05,755
than playing a video game.

358
00:25:06,835 --> 00:25:08,477
And so I guess that's kind of the reason for it.

359
00:25:08,897 --> 00:25:14,421
The colors actually was heavily influenced by I would say Ocarina of Time, especially

360
00:25:14,441 --> 00:25:14,941
in the events.

361
00:25:16,022 --> 00:25:20,725
And that was because I generally don't, when I see a large block of text, I generally don't

362
00:25:20,825 --> 00:25:21,125
read it.

363
00:25:23,747 --> 00:25:25,168
Not because I don't like stories.

364
00:25:25,742 --> 00:25:31,587
That, as, I feel like when it's kinda like forced, then I don't like to read it.

365
00:25:32,908 --> 00:25:36,430
And so naturally I would kinda get into the story and sometimes I'd replay a game and

366
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:40,654
be like, oh, like, I'm kinda interested in the story because I just skipped everything

367
00:25:40,714 --> 00:25:43,095
and suddenly there's like, now I'm a dragon or something.

368
00:25:44,897 --> 00:25:46,538
And so those are the only times.

369
00:25:46,738 --> 00:25:52,062
And so since I didn't wanna read the text, I just wanted to highlight the words, to kinda

370
00:25:52,282 --> 00:25:54,644
be like, bubbling, take damage.

371
00:25:55,882 --> 00:26:00,944
You're going to die if you choose this option or if you're going to get a good thing, but also this other bad thing.

372
00:26:01,424 --> 00:26:07,526
And then the image is just kind of like, for the events, just help out massively because it kind of like,

373
00:26:08,646 --> 00:26:10,647
has a theme of like what's going on in the event.

374
00:26:11,407 --> 00:26:16,809
And I don't know, it's kind of hard to explain, I guess, especially for the events.

375
00:26:17,529 --> 00:26:22,811
But I thought that was a lot of useful information, especially color, the way you described color.

376
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:29,423
Yeah, over time the colors became more like purposeful, but some of the older events they

377
00:26:29,443 --> 00:26:31,905
would have, they would just have colors just for flavor.

378
00:26:32,686 --> 00:26:36,769
So they might be a bit confusing as they, as they're not as consistent as the other

379
00:26:36,809 --> 00:26:37,329
ones I'd say.

380
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,071
Gotcha.

381
00:26:39,611 --> 00:26:41,272
Well thank you for sharing that.

382
00:26:41,393 --> 00:26:43,995
I'm going to shuffle along the question board here.

383
00:26:46,477 --> 00:26:48,218
Something that also got mentioned.

384
00:26:49,592 --> 00:27:04,444
In Anthony's chat with our Gamasutra cohort, was the idea of kind of the Rube Goldberg machine of design where by the end of a run you're stringing individual cards together to create these wacky combos.

385
00:27:04,644 --> 00:27:12,670
As I mentioned, for this run, Shrug It Off and Body Slam became the dominant force for my run.

386
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:14,892
How did you...

387
00:27:17,188 --> 00:27:20,270
Go about looking at your game and saying,

388
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:24,193
okay, we have these individual card ideas and these ones string together.

389
00:27:24,233 --> 00:27:26,615
There's Rube Goldberg and these ones don't.

390
00:27:26,635 --> 00:27:28,956
Or these ones show up in testing, we didn't even know they string together.

391
00:27:28,976 --> 00:27:32,579
Could you talk about that process of kind of the combo system?

392
00:27:33,099 --> 00:27:35,301
That's part of what makes this game sing so much.

393
00:27:36,262 --> 00:27:36,662
Oh, I see.

394
00:27:36,682 --> 00:27:42,386
Um, well, the short answer is you just have to play your own game a lot.

395
00:27:43,827 --> 00:27:46,509
But I guess the longer answer is we try to...

396
00:27:47,331 --> 00:27:53,516
evaluate cards. So we make a bunch of cards that we think are interesting mechanically at first,

397
00:27:53,857 --> 00:27:58,341
and we just kind of toss them into like the deck, right? Yeah, like an actual card pool.

398
00:27:59,782 --> 00:28:04,306
And then we play it a bit. And then we're like, this works, this doesn't work. Like this UX,

399
00:28:04,946 --> 00:28:09,090
or this kind of mechanic might be fun as like a physical game, but it's not as fun,

400
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:12,553
you know, in a digital game. So that happens pretty frequently. So we kind of like,

401
00:28:13,474 --> 00:28:15,235
try to figure out what feels good in a game.

402
00:28:16,495 --> 00:28:16,555
In

403
00:28:16,575 --> 00:28:16,876
a nutshell, in

404
00:28:45,399 --> 00:28:46,800
and it just ramps very slowly.

405
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,121
And you just, I guess you just feel it all out.

406
00:28:50,281 --> 00:28:55,824
And then the rude Goldberg happens when you try to combine two mechanics at once, but

407
00:28:55,884 --> 00:28:59,166
not in a way that it's so, there are some cards that are very exclusive.

408
00:29:00,847 --> 00:29:02,167
Like we're on the topic of strength.

409
00:29:02,387 --> 00:29:08,110
And so like a card that doubles your strength is like completely worthless for a non-strength

410
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:08,350
deck.

411
00:29:08,691 --> 00:29:08,891
Yeah.

412
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:10,411
That's actually a card that is.

413
00:29:11,734 --> 00:29:16,457
not good for making very strong synergies, but it also has a different purpose, which

414
00:29:16,557 --> 00:29:20,981
is if you are in that specific type of mechanic, it makes it very, very good.

415
00:29:21,221 --> 00:29:21,861
You go all in.

416
00:29:22,142 --> 00:29:24,984
So it's like an all-in card, where all the cards are more flexible.

417
00:29:25,244 --> 00:29:26,725
Shrug it off gains block and draws cards.

418
00:29:26,885 --> 00:29:29,528
So it's like a high utility, just easy-going card.

419
00:29:30,308 --> 00:29:36,293
Then you start, and then we choose one card, which is for each character, that highlights

420
00:29:36,373 --> 00:29:36,873
one mechanic.

421
00:29:37,624 --> 00:29:40,305
And for the Ironclad, that's like, applies vulnerable to the enemy.

422
00:29:40,726 --> 00:29:46,490
And so we have another card called Dropkick, and that is if the enemy is vulnerable, you

423
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,371
deal damage and you draw a card and you gain energy.

424
00:29:50,032 --> 00:29:54,915
And that's good because, so Dropkick by itself, if you don't have any vulnerable playing cards,

425
00:29:56,536 --> 00:30:03,181
it's not, like applying debuffs in most video games is not enticing, I think, at least in

426
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:03,481
my head.

427
00:30:04,132 --> 00:30:08,636
But since their starting card gives you the opportunity to apply Vulnerable every single game,

428
00:30:09,736 --> 00:30:12,799
having Dropkick as part of the pool that's only good with Vulnerable is fine.

429
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:18,763
But generally we just have to identify what works and what doesn't.

430
00:30:19,143 --> 00:30:23,987
The Ironclad is the easiest just because it plays off of the core mechanics.

431
00:30:25,107 --> 00:30:25,948
I guess there is a...

432
00:30:27,449 --> 00:30:30,051
We added Exhaust for this character. We wanted it kind of Exhaust themed.

433
00:30:30,451 --> 00:30:33,613
But we did explore other themes as well like self-damage.

434
00:30:34,379 --> 00:30:39,924
It ended up not being very fun, or very, very difficult to gauge how useful it was because

435
00:30:39,944 --> 00:30:44,467
I think the healing in our game is very, very restrictive.

436
00:30:45,348 --> 00:30:55,015
And also, it was hard to balance HP loss and healing, but that also somehow scales with

437
00:30:55,075 --> 00:30:55,755
other characters.

438
00:30:56,576 --> 00:30:59,938
And so that's why the main relic is kind of like a healing relic.

439
00:31:01,399 --> 00:31:03,341
So it's kind of just, I don't know, it's very easygoing.

440
00:31:03,871 --> 00:31:07,392
We also tried different relics in the beginning too, and even different character...

441
00:31:08,253 --> 00:31:09,273
I think we called them loadouts.

442
00:31:10,153 --> 00:31:15,415
Where we had different versions of the Ironclad, which started with different relics and a different set of starter cards.

443
00:31:16,616 --> 00:31:19,777
But that was eventually replaced by...

444
00:31:19,797 --> 00:31:22,498
I guess it's just called Nyao.

445
00:31:23,158 --> 00:31:25,379
We called it the Gashapon System in the very beginning.

446
00:31:26,179 --> 00:31:26,820
Which stands for...

447
00:31:29,423 --> 00:31:30,583
Like these machines in Japan.

448
00:31:30,603 --> 00:31:35,324
Yeah, gashapon systems where you get a random capsule out and it has a random prize.

449
00:31:35,765 --> 00:31:36,145
Exactly.

450
00:31:36,405 --> 00:31:38,865
So instead, we have our gashapon system.

451
00:31:38,885 --> 00:31:42,426
Whenever you start a new game, you kind of randomize what you start with.

452
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:49,888
That was more like, there's more potential for wackiness than us saying like, hey, like

453
00:31:49,928 --> 00:31:51,849
this is a character that thrives on HP loss.

454
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:54,070
Or hey, this is a character that thrives on strength.

455
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:58,771
Or like, this is a character that draws fewer cards, but is much stronger.

456
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:05,343
So, um, just trying a lot of things and then I guess highlighting what is fun and then

457
00:32:05,683 --> 00:32:07,644
taking away what is, what is not fun.

458
00:32:09,459 --> 00:32:12,321
I'm going to shuffle while we're talking about cards and finding cards and stuff.

459
00:32:12,622 --> 00:32:14,323
One of the things that drew me to...

460
00:32:15,284 --> 00:32:16,445
that helped me get the...

461
00:32:16,465 --> 00:32:17,406
excuse me...

462
00:32:17,786 --> 00:32:21,810
that helped Slay the Spire draw my attention was...

463
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:26,314
I was reading a blog post from game designer Tom Francis

464
00:32:27,014 --> 00:32:29,837
who made Gunpoint and Heat Signature and some other cool games.

465
00:32:30,457 --> 00:32:35,940
And some really interesting thoughts about the card, Tools of the Trade.

466
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:36,641
Tools of the Trade?

467
00:32:36,781 --> 00:32:37,541
Yeah, Tools of the Trade.

468
00:32:38,142 --> 00:32:43,344
And he said it's an interesting card because it's a card that lets you draw six cards instead

469
00:32:43,364 --> 00:32:46,346
of five, which you can see here I drew five, but then you discard one.

470
00:32:46,766 --> 00:32:51,028
In his feedback it says you're still getting five cards at the end but you have a slight

471
00:32:51,048 --> 00:32:52,789
amount of choice over what card you get.

472
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:57,814
Um, and he compared it to a guard card in another game we streamed called Nowhere Prophet.

473
00:32:58,195 --> 00:33:02,179
Uh, um, that- oh god, I'm blanking on the studio name for that, but go check out our stream with

474
00:33:02,199 --> 00:33:06,524
the Nowhere Prophet dev. That's Martin- oh, I'm forgetting his last name. Martin's a great guy,

475
00:33:06,564 --> 00:33:10,948
check out that game. Really- I know Nowhere Prophet. Yeah. I think- I think we- I think

476
00:33:10,968 --> 00:33:14,992
they announced their game before we announced our game. We were like, whoa, someone else is making

477
00:33:15,012 --> 00:33:16,554
a rogue-bowler game.

478
00:33:16,988 --> 00:33:28,012
Yeah, he made a comparison that the power to choose a card from your hand to discard and then draw another to replace it and Tools of the Trade are really very similar.

479
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:35,714
They're almost the same thing because you are gaining your fixed hand of cards and then just having slight agency over what one of those cards is.

480
00:33:35,754 --> 00:33:44,017
But he said Tools of the Trade is interestingly a quote bad feeling card because you're looking at a hand of six and getting rid of one as opposed to selectively changing one card.

481
00:33:44,057 --> 00:33:45,777
So I've got the blog post in front of me right now.

482
00:33:46,457 --> 00:33:53,302
I'll drop it in Twitch chat if people want to read it, but um, I was curious if uh, how like good feelings about drawing cards

483
00:33:53,862 --> 00:33:59,145
Uh, like how you were sort of navigating that decision path about you know, bad choices good choices for that kind of thing

484
00:33:59,886 --> 00:34:00,146
Hmm

485
00:34:01,487 --> 00:34:06,090
I didn't think too much about good choices or bad choices. Honestly. Oh, that's fair. I guess. Um

486
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:10,813
I don't know. We generally think about the overall value of cards. Yeah rather than like

487
00:34:11,693 --> 00:34:12,614
feelings of outcomes

488
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,260
I guess sometimes, maybe we do it subconsciously.

489
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,961
I don't think we actively design upon it.

490
00:34:17,841 --> 00:34:22,302
Um, I think we made Tools of the Trade because we wanted something that gives you...

491
00:34:22,322 --> 00:34:26,943
Because we had a discard synergy in the second character.

492
00:34:27,583 --> 00:34:29,804
And so there was a card that gave it to you once a turn.

493
00:34:29,964 --> 00:34:31,805
And that was what was interesting about it.

494
00:34:32,145 --> 00:34:32,345
Yeah.

495
00:34:32,765 --> 00:34:34,365
More so than a good feeling, bad feeling.

496
00:34:34,725 --> 00:34:36,606
Hm. I have to read the article.

497
00:34:36,786 --> 00:34:42,107
I'm not entirely sure why it would feel bad to play Tools of the Trade.

498
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:45,385
because it just gives you more opportunity.

499
00:34:45,806 --> 00:34:47,429
But I'm not sure.

500
00:34:47,729 --> 00:34:49,853
I don't think I share the same emotions.

501
00:34:50,194 --> 00:34:50,574
That's fair.

502
00:34:50,675 --> 00:34:51,135
Maybe you don't.

503
00:34:51,356 --> 00:34:52,738
I mean, these are very subjective.

504
00:34:54,684 --> 00:34:59,388
Factors we're dealing with, and that's why we at GDC and Gabasutra love talking about it,

505
00:34:59,448 --> 00:35:04,393
because sometimes it's math, and sometimes you can say objectively something is a certain way in games,

506
00:35:04,453 --> 00:35:05,994
and sometimes it's very subjective.

507
00:35:07,155 --> 00:35:09,617
And that's what makes it such an interesting art.

508
00:35:11,879 --> 00:35:15,282
For my part... Oh man, I had a follow-up question on that.

509
00:35:15,482 --> 00:35:17,304
I'm blanking on it. Why am I blanking on it?

510
00:35:17,464 --> 00:35:18,485
Oh, yeah.

511
00:35:19,554 --> 00:35:24,101
Since you said you talked about the value of cards, um, uh...

512
00:35:24,953 --> 00:35:29,775
I have a, uh, I play a game called X-Wing Miniatures, which I talk about way too much.

513
00:35:30,155 --> 00:35:35,457
Um, and in that game, it used to be until very recently, there was kind of the equivalent of,

514
00:35:35,497 --> 00:35:40,418
you know, like one gram in the game. Like one thing was costed in such a way that you could

515
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:45,739
kind of gauge how everything was costed around that one thing. Um, in that game it was one unit.

516
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:50,261
Um, and that was recently changed so that the cost, that that was less clear. Um.

517
00:35:50,921 --> 00:35:56,445
And I'm curious, like, what in your power measurement toolkit did you use to sort of say,

518
00:35:56,885 --> 00:36:02,629
this is equiv- this is equivocally, this thing is equivalently worth, you know, one point and it does x result.

519
00:36:03,529 --> 00:36:06,611
And everything orbits around that way, you know, measurement.

520
00:36:06,891 --> 00:36:09,873
Did you have any tools like that or did you use something else to figure out your power?

521
00:36:12,155 --> 00:36:13,916
Uh, that's an interesting question.

522
00:36:14,496 --> 00:36:16,497
Um, we didn't have like a baseline, I would say.

523
00:36:18,158 --> 00:36:20,840
Yeah, I guess the baseline wasn't the previous characters.

524
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:21,440
Yeah.

525
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,221
Because we just, we try to keep the same, like, win rate.

526
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:27,643
And so we just have to look at the overall composition.

527
00:36:28,664 --> 00:36:31,365
We like to joke that Bash is the perfect card.

528
00:36:31,645 --> 00:36:31,845
Yeah.

529
00:36:32,385 --> 00:36:37,008
But it's actually, I think, probably slightly weaker than most of the cards we want it to

530
00:36:37,048 --> 00:36:37,948
be at this point.

531
00:36:38,008 --> 00:36:40,509
Just because of the, maybe because of the natural power creep.

532
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:46,052
I kind of blame, kind of the community feedback, maybe.

533
00:36:46,532 --> 00:36:46,872
I think, yeah.

534
00:36:48,757 --> 00:36:52,299
It's interesting to make new cards or modify cards and somebody would be like,

535
00:36:52,899 --> 00:36:55,841
it's almost similar to this card, but it's slightly like weaker.

536
00:36:55,901 --> 00:36:56,941
It's just the worst card.

537
00:36:57,482 --> 00:37:01,604
And so and so maybe we took that as valid criticism.

538
00:37:03,085 --> 00:37:03,805
But am I not?

539
00:37:04,145 --> 00:37:05,206
That's not always the case.

540
00:37:06,486 --> 00:37:09,888
So some of our cards are probably some of the newer cards are a bit too strong.

541
00:37:10,028 --> 00:37:12,189
Maybe. Yeah.

542
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:13,330
Should have followed.

543
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:15,091
Maybe I should have used units, you know.

544
00:37:15,991 --> 00:37:17,352
But I mean, it's impossible to gauge.

545
00:37:18,286 --> 00:37:20,547
um, within different characters, how good or bad a card is.

546
00:37:20,687 --> 00:37:23,469
Even if the- even if it does the exact same thing as another card,

547
00:37:23,789 --> 00:37:24,350
Mm-hmm.

548
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:28,572
just the character being different, having a different relic, having a different card pool, having different synergies,

549
00:37:29,453 --> 00:37:29,553
um,

550
00:37:29,993 --> 00:37:31,314
it just makes a very large difference.

551
00:37:31,554 --> 00:37:33,755
And I think there's also a ton of anecdotal evidence

552
00:37:34,215 --> 00:37:36,236
that a character might feel better than another character,

553
00:37:36,657 --> 00:37:37,157
just because

554
00:37:37,837 --> 00:37:40,099
you've played more runs as the newer character

555
00:37:40,459 --> 00:37:42,220
after having so much more experience in the game.

556
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,401
And so,

557
00:37:44,561 --> 00:37:47,183
I mean, we have to- we just have to re-evaluate things over and over again, I think.

558
00:37:47,731 --> 00:38:01,944
Yeah, that's fair. It's interesting how often we try to grasp for questions about design and design decisions, game feel, all these things, and sometimes the answer really does just come back to you, you just got to test it over and over again.

559
00:38:01,964 --> 00:38:05,487
I do wish there was a formula that would speed up the process very quickly.

560
00:38:05,848 --> 00:38:06,028
Yeah.

561
00:38:06,733 --> 00:38:14,061
Um, alright, uh, let's see, uh, let's talk about, um, I don't know, you know, it's great to spend 40 minutes talking about, uh, game design.

562
00:38:14,121 --> 00:38:16,324
It's one of the coolest things you can do in this profession.

563
00:38:16,864 --> 00:38:19,708
Um, let's talk about, I don't know, production, quality of life.

564
00:38:19,788 --> 00:38:22,671
You and, uh, your collaborator...

565
00:38:23,618 --> 00:38:28,100
You and Anthony, you work remotely, you and I discussed that before the call started.

566
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:33,462
And you don't work out of an office, which means you guys are two indie gevs who get to do this on your own time.

567
00:38:33,522 --> 00:38:36,183
And for some people that's the dream, and for some people that's a nightmare,

568
00:38:36,203 --> 00:38:41,485
because it means their home office is now their work office, and they don't have a place to compartmentalize.

569
00:38:42,205 --> 00:38:47,247
How have you felt in your indie development life, and how have you managed to keep your space productive, I guess,

570
00:38:48,087 --> 00:38:52,108
and feeling good so it doesn't feel like your house is a place you need to escape from?

571
00:38:53,155 --> 00:38:59,837
I see. So currently I actually don't fully work full time from my house slash office.

572
00:39:00,077 --> 00:39:01,158
Yeah.

573
00:39:01,178 --> 00:39:06,899
I actually, when I did work, just from my house office, I worked too much. It was kind

574
00:39:06,919 --> 00:39:08,640
of the opposite. Maybe I had the opposite problem.

575
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:09,140
Yeah.

576
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:17,322
I probably have some kind of compulsive disorder. But the point is, I would generally just start,

577
00:39:17,502 --> 00:39:21,904
I would wake up and I would drink coffee and I would just work until my wife would come

578
00:39:21,944 --> 00:39:22,964
home from work.

579
00:39:23,702 --> 00:39:25,884
and then I would realize I had not had breakfast, lunch.

580
00:39:26,925 --> 00:39:28,646
And so, I guess that was kind of like

581
00:39:29,487 --> 00:39:30,607
the general way that I worked.

582
00:39:30,627 --> 00:39:31,588
Um...

583
00:39:31,628 --> 00:39:34,430
I'm not exactly sure how it was for Anthony.

584
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:37,352
I didn't really ask him quality of life questions too often.

585
00:39:38,653 --> 00:39:40,775
Um, I'm not saying that it's good to work a lot.

586
00:39:41,395 --> 00:39:43,157
Um, just that, that's just how

587
00:39:43,697 --> 00:39:47,860
I guess my personality and my brain is wired to deal with things.

588
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,561
Um, I don't really plan things, I just kind of wake up

589
00:39:49,842 --> 00:39:52,283
and then that day I write a to-do list of what I want to work on.

590
00:39:52,876 --> 00:39:53,716
and then I just do that.

591
00:39:54,136 --> 00:39:58,777
And I guess we generally worked, I think, six days a week.

592
00:40:00,238 --> 00:40:01,118
We're a pretty long time.

593
00:40:02,538 --> 00:40:04,338
And you know, obviously there are times

594
00:40:04,378 --> 00:40:05,979
when things are slower, maybe we're waiting.

595
00:40:07,219 --> 00:40:09,580
We have to get a build ready for like an event,

596
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:11,660
and then after it's ready, we're just kinda like,

597
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:12,840
what do we work on?

598
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,161
We're not gonna like update the build.

599
00:40:14,181 --> 00:40:17,881
So, I mean, we may change in other branches and stuff,

600
00:40:18,001 --> 00:40:21,342
but there's ups and downs, as always, like release time.

601
00:40:21,979 --> 00:40:29,726
Building on that question, the question, if you are watching this and you've been following GDC this year,

602
00:40:30,747 --> 00:40:39,054
you know, we put out the State of the Industry Survey where we try to poll developers for questions ranging from market-based to quality of life-based.

603
00:40:39,695 --> 00:40:44,199
And a big, big topic we keep coming back to every year is a lot of quality of life questions that have to do with...

604
00:40:45,766 --> 00:40:50,510
You know, work hours, crunch, does your company make you crunch, do you self-impose crunch?

605
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:57,975
How do you feel you and your collaborators handled that particular challenge of, you

606
00:40:57,995 --> 00:41:02,158
know, you mentioned you work a lot, but when you set your own schedule, you're the only

607
00:41:02,198 --> 00:41:02,799
responsible for that.

608
00:41:02,819 --> 00:41:05,320
There's no producer saying, they're going like, all right, we got to meet, get ready

609
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:10,884
for E3, it's 20 hour work week, boys and girls, and people who do not identify with either

610
00:41:10,904 --> 00:41:11,405
of those genders.

611
00:41:12,265 --> 00:41:15,308
But yeah, I'm curious how you deal with that.

612
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:19,231
It sounds like you enjoy working, so that's a plus.

613
00:41:19,271 --> 00:41:20,572
Yeah, I do like working.

614
00:41:20,712 --> 00:41:25,015
Well, I mean, it's very different for indie games, I think, compared to AAA.

615
00:41:25,135 --> 00:41:30,660
I think that if you have employees and they are full-time or salary, you know,

616
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:33,002
if they're coming to your office and working,

617
00:41:33,842 --> 00:41:36,044
they should work how much they expect to work,

618
00:41:36,764 --> 00:41:38,146
and you shouldn't force people to work,

619
00:41:38,266 --> 00:41:41,748
because there will be long-term ramifications.

620
00:41:43,275 --> 00:41:46,096
I mean, it's not much for me to say, because I just don't...

621
00:41:47,357 --> 00:41:48,658
Like, I've just never been in that position.

622
00:41:48,678 --> 00:41:50,299
Like, I've never really managed people in that way.

623
00:41:50,699 --> 00:41:53,000
Like, sure, we've had contractors, but those...

624
00:41:53,161 --> 00:41:53,421
We have...

625
00:41:54,341 --> 00:41:58,964
In those dates for the contracts, we know when things are going to be finished.

626
00:42:00,345 --> 00:42:02,626
And so we never really forced anybody to work overtime.

627
00:42:03,167 --> 00:42:04,607
Um, like we worked overtime.

628
00:42:04,928 --> 00:42:07,949
We don't really talk about it being overtime or not.

629
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:10,871
When we were like looking for packs, it was just like, oh, we need to, we

630
00:42:10,891 --> 00:42:12,312
want to finish this by this date.

631
00:42:12,783 --> 00:42:12,904
to

632
00:42:12,924 --> 00:42:13,344
release.

633
00:42:40,957 --> 00:42:45,330
It doesn't really matter too much whether or not, you know, you meet expectations.

634
00:42:47,511 --> 00:42:51,733
Uh, yeah, wow. How does it feel then to transition from a game having no hype on release to, um...

635
00:42:52,493 --> 00:43:11,784
I don't know, we won't, you know, exaggerate Slay the Spire's success and say you guys are at Minecraft or Fortnite levels, but, uh, you guys have a dedicated community, you've sold a couple million copies, and, uh, um, game, you know, big streamers will just regularly pop on your game and interest, sort of, attract new audiences sometimes.

636
00:43:12,725 --> 00:43:15,546
How, what, how's that, how's that felt going from sort of A to B there?

637
00:43:16,956 --> 00:43:18,617
Uh, it's just, it's kind of surreal.

638
00:43:21,159 --> 00:43:24,461
Cause, um, I don't know, it's just something about I think interacting

639
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:27,783
with digital mediums, it's very difficult to kind of parse, like

640
00:43:28,904 --> 00:43:30,265
the crazy changes that happen.

641
00:43:30,745 --> 00:43:30,966
Yeah.

642
00:43:31,106 --> 00:43:35,288
Like one day we'd be like, oh, like, like Kripparian is like streaming our game.

643
00:43:35,749 --> 00:43:36,349
And we're like, what?

644
00:43:36,589 --> 00:43:40,412
And so we would like hop on the stream and we'd be like, like, like, oh, like,

645
00:43:40,432 --> 00:43:43,434
we like, we love, we love the game that you streamed like Diablo 3

646
00:43:43,494 --> 00:43:44,394
back in the day and stuff.

647
00:43:44,715 --> 00:43:44,875
Yeah.

648
00:43:45,443 --> 00:43:45,923
And then he...

649
00:43:46,843 --> 00:43:47,944
And then Crypt would just be like,

650
00:43:48,344 --> 00:43:49,184
Oh hey, developers!

651
00:43:50,025 --> 00:43:50,785
Or be like, oh...

652
00:43:51,265 --> 00:43:53,126
But I think it's very relatively unknown

653
00:43:54,166 --> 00:43:55,967
that our studio is like two people.

654
00:43:56,307 --> 00:43:56,587
Yeah.

655
00:43:57,007 --> 00:43:59,968
So maybe they thought it was like a weird corporate-like thing.

656
00:44:02,029 --> 00:44:02,649
But it's, you know...

657
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:04,370
It's very friendly.

658
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:05,050
I don't know.

659
00:44:06,451 --> 00:44:08,071
It's kind of hard to answer the question because

660
00:44:08,091 --> 00:44:09,152
I haven't really

661
00:44:10,192 --> 00:44:10,892
parsed it too much.

662
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:13,913
It's just a strange feeling, yeah.

663
00:44:14,422 --> 00:44:15,282
Yeah, that's fair.

664
00:44:15,723 --> 00:44:16,804
Um, God, I don't think...

665
00:44:17,124 --> 00:44:19,366
I think if there's only one thing I've become convinced is that, uh,

666
00:44:19,826 --> 00:44:22,469
no individual human being can deal with the concept of fame,

667
00:44:22,589 --> 00:44:25,652
and that's why people who are famous have teams of people who manage it for them.

668
00:44:26,392 --> 00:44:29,195
Um, and if you don't, they don't, then terrible things happen.

669
00:44:29,215 --> 00:44:30,636
Um, but that's a personal opinion.

670
00:44:31,256 --> 00:44:31,957
That's not a...

671
00:44:33,125 --> 00:44:33,666
Universal truth.

672
00:44:34,367 --> 00:44:39,671
Anyway, moving on, we've got about 15 minutes left in the stream here for our folks in chat.

673
00:44:39,791 --> 00:44:42,814
If you've got any questions, drop them in, we will take them before we get out of here.

674
00:44:43,895 --> 00:44:48,619
For my part, let's see, I guess...

675
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:56,722
Looking ahead for you and Anthony, what's next for Slate the Spire?

676
00:44:56,742 --> 00:44:59,923
You've got an awards show next month, so I guess you guys will probably have to...

677
00:44:59,943 --> 00:45:04,823
I don't know about a suit, but y'all will be picking out some collar shirts for that ceremony.

678
00:45:05,564 --> 00:45:08,524
Or you can show up in t-shirts, it's fine, it's a game developer ceremony.

679
00:45:08,544 --> 00:45:13,285
No! I will not be there with a t-shirt, that's messed up.

680
00:45:13,445 --> 00:45:17,266
That's fair. Anyway, what are you guys interested in?

681
00:45:17,286 --> 00:45:19,126
We have to show up in a t-shirt.

682
00:45:20,695 --> 00:45:22,156
Um, what are you guys excited about for the future?

683
00:45:23,297 --> 00:45:24,318
What are we excited about for the future?

684
00:45:25,339 --> 00:45:25,479
Um...

685
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:27,240
Oh, my alarm is going off.

686
00:45:28,281 --> 00:45:30,763
Are you excited to take care of that alarm? That's what you're excited about.

687
00:45:31,564 --> 00:45:32,084
Oh, you're funny.

688
00:45:32,625 --> 00:45:33,625
I can't hear it, fun fact, so...

689
00:45:33,666 --> 00:45:35,967
Oh, it was someone else's alarm.

690
00:45:36,648 --> 00:45:38,630
Huh. Um, anyway, sorry.

691
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:40,211
What are we excited about?

692
00:45:41,312 --> 00:45:42,353
Um, that's a good question.

693
00:45:42,373 --> 00:45:43,414
I think we're...

694
00:45:44,514 --> 00:45:46,496
We're still working on... I don't know, we don't really

695
00:45:46,836 --> 00:45:48,017
plan too far ahead in the future.

696
00:45:48,658 --> 00:45:49,398
We're finishing up.

697
00:45:50,876 --> 00:45:55,017
We're helping out with some porting work, and there's some localization work and some

698
00:45:55,037 --> 00:45:57,518
other, like, a lot of work related around Sleight of Spire.

699
00:46:00,379 --> 00:46:03,280
We generally kind of like talk about it each time afterwards.

700
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:07,221
We don't constantly ask, like, how do we feel about working on this next?

701
00:46:07,621 --> 00:46:10,241
If we're both feeling good about it, we'll probably push forward.

702
00:46:10,702 --> 00:46:11,182
I'm not sure.

703
00:46:11,202 --> 00:46:18,684
I think we're also kind of like into maybe pursuing different projects as well, but nothing

704
00:46:18,744 --> 00:46:19,824
is completely set in stone.

705
00:46:20,447 --> 00:46:21,388
It really depends on like...

706
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:24,671
I'm not really sure.

707
00:46:24,691 --> 00:46:28,293
I think that...

708
00:46:30,095 --> 00:46:34,258
I think if there's a good idea for Slay the Spire that you want to work on, that gets us excited to work on it.

709
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:34,778
Then it's...

710
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:37,941
Because we're also really into content design.

711
00:46:38,581 --> 00:46:39,242
And so maybe...

712
00:46:40,283 --> 00:46:41,123
Maybe...

713
00:46:41,143 --> 00:46:43,786
I'm not too sure.

714
00:46:43,806 --> 00:46:45,607
If we'll be expanding.

715
00:46:45,627 --> 00:46:48,049
I'll have to think about it.

716
00:46:49,749 --> 00:46:52,053
It's not... I guess it's not sure. That's the answer.

717
00:46:52,113 --> 00:46:56,019
That's a good answer. I don't say that's a good answer. It's, you know, hey, no one knows the future.

718
00:46:56,099 --> 00:46:59,004
No one knows. No one knows what they gotta be ready for.

719
00:46:59,625 --> 00:47:01,968
So, being ready for that is the same.

720
00:47:02,209 --> 00:47:03,831
Being ready for what you're not ready for is a good...

721
00:47:04,953 --> 00:47:07,036
Way to do things I think. Anyway, um

722
00:47:07,577 --> 00:47:13,145
After that ramble, I guess I will I guess my my last question because coming up with questions is

723
00:47:13,886 --> 00:47:16,530
Genuinely challenging and sometimes you just run through your list

724
00:47:19,634 --> 00:47:23,516
Y'all, we're here, we're streaming this because y'all are nominated for the IGF awards.

725
00:47:24,356 --> 00:47:30,039
There might be other developers watching this now or later who are also hoping to one day, you know, participate in those awards.

726
00:47:30,859 --> 00:47:34,581
Oh man, these little guys weirded me out so much, I was like, where did they come from? What is going on?

727
00:47:34,981 --> 00:47:37,483
Anything cute?

728
00:47:37,503 --> 00:47:37,743
Yeah.

729
00:47:37,763 --> 00:47:39,423
What's this guy with the confusion thing on his head?

730
00:47:40,224 --> 00:47:47,567
Anyway, my question would be, I guess, if for developers who are interested in participating in the awards,

731
00:47:48,908 --> 00:47:52,835
What would you say to them? You know, like, they're an indie dev, just like you were when you started developing this.

732
00:47:52,935 --> 00:47:57,021
They want to make something that's IGF, ready for the IGF. What's your thoughts for them?

733
00:47:58,143 --> 00:48:00,767
Hmm, like, to make like a video game, you mean?

734
00:48:01,978 --> 00:48:07,042
I don't know, make a video game, market a video game, I don't know, like it's basically like the...

735
00:48:07,422 --> 00:48:12,666
I'll roleplay this for you as it's a developer, they're working on something indie and cool and it's neat,

736
00:48:13,327 --> 00:48:18,551
and they're looking at your IGF nomination and going, man, like I'd love to be there one day too.

737
00:48:19,471 --> 00:48:20,652
I guess, what would you say to that person?

738
00:48:21,413 --> 00:48:26,497
I see. I would say that if you try new things, and it's clear that you're trying new things,

739
00:48:27,157 --> 00:48:29,980
then people will be very receptive to that and they'll support you.

740
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:31,581
But I think if you're trying to make...

741
00:48:32,288 --> 00:48:37,371
like a knockoff, like I think some people think that they have figured it out by working on

742
00:48:37,811 --> 00:48:42,874
some kind of genre or some kind of like aesthetic that they think works, then people will catch

743
00:48:42,934 --> 00:48:43,294
onto that.

744
00:48:43,494 --> 00:48:43,834
I don't know.

745
00:48:44,035 --> 00:48:49,137
It just has to be genuine I think, and if you are I think it's very obvious.

746
00:48:50,198 --> 00:48:58,862
So, work on what you think you want to make, you want to play, and not what you think other

747
00:48:58,902 --> 00:49:00,903
people want to play, but what you genuinely

748
00:49:01,867 --> 00:49:02,067
Think

749
00:49:02,247 --> 00:49:02,627
you can do it.

750
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:22,784
Right on. I know I said before that we have 15 minutes left on the stream, but like I said,

751
00:49:23,424 --> 00:49:26,947
sometimes you just run out of questions. You make a nice list, you do some research,

752
00:49:27,507 --> 00:49:30,189
and you go through the list, and then you look over, and there's 10 minutes left.

753
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:35,473
And thankfully, because I run the show, and not a network, not ABC,

754
00:49:35,873 --> 00:49:38,035
not Netflix, not Hulu, because I'm in charge.

755
00:49:38,635 --> 00:49:41,537
I hate to say it when the show hits.

756
00:49:41,578 --> 00:49:45,300
With that in mind, thank you everyone for watching our conversation with Casey Yano today.

757
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:49,643
The game has been Slay the Spire. You can check it out on Steam. I know it's on Nintendo Switch.

758
00:49:49,883 --> 00:49:53,486
What other platforms is it on, Casey? I should have gotten that much sooner.

759
00:49:53,506 --> 00:49:59,090
I think it's currently on Xbox One, PS4, Switch, and PC, Mac, Linux.

760
00:49:59,270 --> 00:49:59,610
Sweet.

761
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:01,731
And it'll be coming out on more stuff.

762
00:50:02,478 --> 00:50:04,139
Even though there was more stuff to put it out on.

763
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:07,363
But yeah! You should check out Slay The Spire if you haven't already.

764
00:50:07,383 --> 00:50:10,946
It's a good way to kill three hours of-

765
00:50:11,046 --> 00:50:13,648
Three plus hours of your day and just not even realize they passed.

766
00:50:14,069 --> 00:50:15,630
Yeah, this stream is really distracting.

767
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:18,153
Um... Where the game itself?

768
00:50:18,853 --> 00:50:18,973
Yeah.

769
00:50:19,781 --> 00:50:23,264
Oh yeah, um, uh, yeah, oh my god, watching my own...

770
00:50:24,205 --> 00:50:29,009
Because I know more about the game four hours after playing it for four hours than I did at two, you know, one or two.

771
00:50:29,429 --> 00:50:32,332
I get to look back and watch my own mistakes when we pre-record footage like this.

772
00:50:32,992 --> 00:50:40,258
Um, yeah, uh, for, for, um, for folks at home, if you'd like to see, uh, Slay the Spire at the IGF Awards,

773
00:50:40,598 --> 00:50:44,622
you can join us at Game Developers Conference in person March 16th through 20th.

774
00:50:44,662 --> 00:50:47,805
The awards themselves will be on the 18th on that Wednesday.

775
00:50:49,186 --> 00:50:52,390
That'll be in the evening and you can everyone with a GDC pass can attend

776
00:50:53,171 --> 00:50:58,398
If you are going to be at home wherever you are in the world, you can watch this twitch channel if you hit that subscribe button

777
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:03,904
Not subscribe follow follow subscribe is a different thing on Twitch. Um, if you hit that follow button

778
00:51:04,365 --> 00:51:11,069
You will be able to watch the awards ceremony live, which will include the IGF Awards, where Slay the Spire is nominated,

779
00:51:11,529 --> 00:51:14,651
and the Game Developers Choice Awards, where a whole bunch of other games are nominated.

780
00:51:15,312 --> 00:51:19,515
For the rest of February into March, we're going to be doing our best to talk to a bunch of the nominees.

781
00:51:19,535 --> 00:51:23,918
We've actually already... It's funny, when I was booking people for this month, the next, I was like,

782
00:51:23,958 --> 00:51:26,599
wow, we streamed a lot of these games already before they were nominated.

783
00:51:26,619 --> 00:51:29,961
That... Big and small. That was something really special.

784
00:51:30,402 --> 00:51:37,166
Um, uh, uh, EC94, uh, this guy is talking about moving his mouth because the guy you are looking

785
00:51:37,226 --> 00:51:41,949
at is Casey, and I am Bryant. I am invisible, uh, because that's some of the trade-offs we

786
00:51:41,969 --> 00:51:49,213
have to do to run this stream. Um, but I appreciate you joining us, EC94. Um, anyway, with that,

787
00:51:49,534 --> 00:51:51,675
um, yeah, we'd love it if you followed the channel. Um...

788
00:51:52,735 --> 00:51:56,916
If you're interested in other information about this year's IGF nominees,

789
00:51:57,376 --> 00:52:03,637
Gamasutra.com is running the Road to the IGF, a series of articles interviewing a bunch of IGF developers.

790
00:52:03,977 --> 00:52:09,058
So if you enjoy hearing from Casey, I will drop the one with Anthony into chat,

791
00:52:09,078 --> 00:52:12,099
so you can read what he had to say about this really cool game.

792
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:15,119
With that, I think that covers it.

793
00:52:16,039 --> 00:52:20,980
Casey, if they've got more questions about the development of Slay the Spire, where can they ask them?

794
00:52:22,661 --> 00:52:25,744
I'm always kind of hanging out in the discord, but if there are any questions

795
00:52:26,585 --> 00:52:31,270
Posted in other like social media things even our Twitter even our support email addresses

796
00:52:32,411 --> 00:52:36,174
We pretty much always answer them. Yeah, I would say I don't know we're very transparent

797
00:52:36,214 --> 00:52:40,679
I think compared to I don't really say compared to anything because I've never asked other developers

798
00:52:41,339 --> 00:52:44,142
Questions, but I don't know we're always around so

799
00:52:45,143 --> 00:52:46,704
Right on.

800
00:52:47,124 --> 00:52:50,425
As we close today, I'll just note that when I saw that this little slime had a bowler

801
00:52:50,465 --> 00:52:54,146
hat on, I paused, I laughed a little, and then I moved on.

802
00:52:56,127 --> 00:52:58,248
Yeah, EC94, Casey is a dev for this game.

803
00:52:59,268 --> 00:53:02,569
Casey is one of two developers, plus some contractors for Slay the Spire.

804
00:53:03,789 --> 00:53:06,130
I would say we have two and a half developers.

805
00:53:06,410 --> 00:53:07,551
Yeah, two and a half.

806
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:08,291
That makes sense.

807
00:53:08,331 --> 00:53:09,911
In fact, if you go into the game...

808
00:53:12,149 --> 00:53:17,033
Oh man, yeah, we'll let EC94's comment go through before I close the stream.

809
00:53:17,333 --> 00:53:18,814
They say thank you for the amazing game.

810
00:53:19,015 --> 00:53:19,375
They love it.

811
00:53:19,395 --> 00:53:21,076
You're welcome.

812
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:21,877
Thank you for playing.

813
00:53:23,590 --> 00:53:27,352
With that, now I will officially click the closing button.

814
00:53:27,452 --> 00:53:31,595
EC94, if you or anyone else want to check out the full stream, it's going to be archived on our Twitch channel,

815
00:53:31,915 --> 00:53:33,596
so you can watch the full thing and our highlights.

816
00:53:33,956 --> 00:53:38,538
And then I'll also kick it over to YouTube so you all can watch it there as well.

817
00:53:38,879 --> 00:53:42,941
With that, have a good day everyone, have a good Wednesday, and enjoy the rest of your week,

818
00:53:42,961 --> 00:53:45,242
and enjoy your time in Slay the Spire. Bye!
