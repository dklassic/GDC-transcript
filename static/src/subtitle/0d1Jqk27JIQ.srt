Hello, my name is Matthew Gallant, and I work on combat design and AI at Naughty Dog.

2
00:00:06,708 --> 00:00:10,771
I'll be speaking at GDC this year about the development of Uncharted 4, A Thief's End.

3
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:16,594
In the previous Uncharted games, the flow of combat was very tightly authored by the design team.

4
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:22,618
However, we had some new design goals on Uncharted 4, and that gave us a chance to re-evaluate our approach.

5
00:00:23,438 --> 00:00:29,642
Our plans for open-ended gameplay in large, complex environments led us to explore a more systems-driven approach to AI.

6
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:37,594
I'll talk about how we oversteered in that direction, but ultimately found a balance between authored content and systemic behaviors.

7
00:00:38,494 --> 00:00:46,680
I'll be covering topics such as how to decide which aspects of combat AI should be authored by designers, and which parts are better handled with systems-driven logic.

8
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:52,303
How to make multiple NPCs spread out intelligently in a large, complex combat space.

9
00:00:53,364 --> 00:00:57,686
And how to focus on the player's experience when developing new behaviors for NPCs.

10
00:00:59,435 --> 00:01:02,572
You can catch the talk on Thursday, March 2nd from 4 to 5 p.m.
