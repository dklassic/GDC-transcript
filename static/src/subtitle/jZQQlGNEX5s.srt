1
00:00:04,817 --> 00:00:05,978
So hey GDC, thanks for coming.

2
00:00:06,898 --> 00:00:07,638
I'm Bob de Schutter.

3
00:00:07,998 --> 00:00:09,539
I'm a Belgian game designer and professor

4
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:10,899
at Miami University of Ohio.

5
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:13,500
And I'm currently working on a game called Brukel

6
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,180
about my World War II surviving grandmother.

7
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,981
But my main line of research that we'll be talking about

8
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:19,902
today concerns games and aging.

9
00:00:20,722 --> 00:00:24,263
Now, you might know me from such previous GDC talks as

10
00:00:25,463 --> 00:00:27,204
Beyond Ageism, Designing Meaningful Games

11
00:00:27,224 --> 00:00:28,504
for Older Adults, and...

12
00:00:28,524 --> 00:00:28,564
No.

13
00:00:30,685 --> 00:00:32,985
Well, I really only did that one, so.

14
00:00:34,592 --> 00:00:35,453
But that was last year.

15
00:00:36,474 --> 00:00:38,595
So could you raise your hand if you were here last year

16
00:00:38,615 --> 00:00:39,376
so I have some idea?

17
00:00:40,517 --> 00:00:40,697
Ooh.

18
00:00:41,418 --> 00:00:41,638
All right.

19
00:00:41,678 --> 00:00:42,799
Thanks for coming back, guys.

20
00:00:43,519 --> 00:00:43,740
Sorry?

21
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:45,261
Thanks, Jeremy.

22
00:00:45,401 --> 00:00:45,881
Love you, man.

23
00:00:47,663 --> 00:00:48,724
So all right.

24
00:00:49,384 --> 00:00:52,527
So today we're going to do the sequel, really, to my talk

25
00:00:52,567 --> 00:00:53,067
from last year.

26
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,241
So, to give you a quick idea what I talked about back then,

27
00:00:58,161 --> 00:01:00,141
I basically summed up 12 years of research,

28
00:01:00,421 --> 00:01:01,902
my own research, that of others as well,

29
00:01:02,422 --> 00:01:04,142
in a 50 minute primer that taught you

30
00:01:04,222 --> 00:01:06,083
everything you needed to know to design great games

31
00:01:06,103 --> 00:01:07,043
for older audiences.

32
00:01:07,843 --> 00:01:10,284
Well, and specifically this guy,

33
00:01:11,064 --> 00:01:12,765
which is a picture of me if I'm older.

34
00:01:13,285 --> 00:01:15,905
Now, I crammed a lot of different topics in that talk,

35
00:01:16,106 --> 00:01:18,166
and people really seemed to like it, especially Jeremy.

36
00:01:19,566 --> 00:01:21,827
But there was this one question that I really couldn't answer.

37
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:24,503
It was, what about VR, Bob?

38
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,303
And yeah, what about it?

39
00:01:27,064 --> 00:01:28,924
You see, a lot of the material that I talk about

40
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:29,825
comes from academia.

41
00:01:30,505 --> 00:01:32,725
And to be honest, there were a lot of articles

42
00:01:32,766 --> 00:01:34,126
with the term VR in the title.

43
00:01:35,146 --> 00:01:37,147
But all of them were by very ambitious academics

44
00:01:37,167 --> 00:01:38,828
who used the term to refer to things such as

45
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:41,148
the Nintendo Wii, the Microsoft Kinect,

46
00:01:41,989 --> 00:01:44,509
even Dance Dance Revolution inspired dance games for seniors.

47
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:45,810
Yeah, that actually exists.

48
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:50,712
So technically, that's not really incorrect to talk about VR,

49
00:01:51,752 --> 00:01:55,534
to refer to these things, because they all simulate your presence in a virtual environment.

50
00:01:56,154 --> 00:01:58,875
But they're obviously not the latest and greatest consumer VR

51
00:01:58,955 --> 00:02:00,956
that had got everybody so excited about last year.

52
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:04,918
So all things considered, last year there wasn't really that much literature

53
00:02:04,978 --> 00:02:07,739
on audiovisual VR games for older adults out there.

54
00:02:08,299 --> 00:02:11,560
And that obviously meant that I really couldn't give you my opinion on the topic,

55
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,561
since I do need some supporting research to do so.

56
00:02:14,382 --> 00:02:22,587
After all, despite the many clear similarities, I'm not a counselor to our president, and while there's definitely some opinion in this talk, I don't deal in alternative facts.

57
00:02:23,927 --> 00:02:32,112
Alright. So, all joking aside, we're a year along since Denon, my team, has conducted some informal tests, an exploratory study, a lit review.

58
00:02:32,613 --> 00:02:39,617
We asked around in the industry, and I've been able to update last year's talk for VR. So, let's get started and talk about VR for all the audiences.

59
00:02:40,624 --> 00:02:44,526
So last year I started the talk revealing how older adults

60
00:02:44,586 --> 00:02:47,028
and 50-plus-year-olds are going to be a huge segment

61
00:02:47,048 --> 00:02:47,849
of the gaming market.

62
00:02:48,609 --> 00:02:50,351
And I got that from making a projection.

63
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:54,554
I combined numbers from the United Nations and the Pew

64
00:02:54,614 --> 00:02:57,216
Research Center, which is a nonpartisan think tank, and I

65
00:02:57,236 --> 00:02:59,517
made a bold claim that by 2045 we could see up to 105 million

66
00:02:59,557 --> 00:03:00,898
US gamers over the age of 50.

67
00:03:05,224 --> 00:03:07,027
Now, that claim is still supportable today.

68
00:03:07,467 --> 00:03:09,350
Pew did a new study and they found that players over 65

69
00:03:10,311 --> 00:03:11,994
even went up from 24% to 25%.

70
00:03:13,216 --> 00:03:15,138
And the United Nations didn't release any new numbers.

71
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:18,102
Now, these demographics are about games, obviously.

72
00:03:18,143 --> 00:03:19,024
They're not about VR.

73
00:03:19,064 --> 00:03:20,606
So again, what about VR, Bob?

74
00:03:20,646 --> 00:03:20,806
Well.

75
00:03:21,387 --> 00:03:22,968
That's still pretty much up in the air.

76
00:03:23,609 --> 00:03:26,952
I only found data about older adults being interested in VR,

77
00:03:26,972 --> 00:03:28,513
which doesn't really specify games,

78
00:03:29,213 --> 00:03:31,896
and it kind of makes sense if you think of it, because the technology is still so new.

79
00:03:32,476 --> 00:03:34,538
So anyway, I got these two surveys.

80
00:03:35,279 --> 00:03:39,943
uVisit reported that 14% of 65% wants to try VR,

81
00:03:40,023 --> 00:03:44,366
and Touchstone Research reported that 64% of baby boomers are interested in VR.

82
00:03:44,987 --> 00:03:47,007
Now, these numbers are clearly pretty far apart,

83
00:03:47,547 --> 00:03:49,148
but I'm leaning towards the latter,

84
00:03:49,308 --> 00:03:52,869
and I'm going to go on a limb here and state that I think that the interest is definitely there.

85
00:03:53,869 --> 00:03:59,131
I personally found it way easier to convince older adults in my own research to play the VR games

86
00:03:59,551 --> 00:04:01,312
than that it was for them to play the regular games,

87
00:04:01,352 --> 00:04:02,612
and I've been doing this for a couple of years

88
00:04:03,872 --> 00:04:06,733
for reasons such as folks, you know, having seen it on television,

89
00:04:06,753 --> 00:04:10,214
or they might have seen VR ages ago and wanted to see how it evolved,

90
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:13,095
or a lot of people just wanted to impress their grandkids and so on.

91
00:04:13,655 --> 00:04:17,997
So that's one reason why I think that there's definitely an initial interest for VR games there.

92
00:04:18,517 --> 00:04:22,459
A second reason is a report by Slice Intelligence that I saw.

93
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:25,220
These guys are actually sponsoring the GDC and have a booth here as well.

94
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:30,302
And they had a sample of 70,000 buyers of PokÃ©mon GO virtual goods.

95
00:04:31,142 --> 00:04:32,422
And 20% of those 70,000 people were older than 55.

96
00:04:35,143 --> 00:04:40,685
So I know it's not VR, it's AR, but in my opinion, it does show that a somewhat similar

97
00:04:40,725 --> 00:04:45,027
technology can find an older audience successfully, and more importantly, an older audience that's

98
00:04:45,067 --> 00:04:45,947
willing to pay for it.

99
00:04:46,747 --> 00:04:51,449
So considering the demographics when looking at PC games and mobile games, there is definitely

100
00:04:51,529 --> 00:04:56,451
a substantial audience of 50-plus-year-olds, and I do see some indications that this will

101
00:04:56,531 --> 00:05:00,512
grow into a VR audience in the same way that we see with younger audiences.

102
00:05:01,232 --> 00:05:04,898
However, for developers creating VR games, the key question here today is how do we go

103
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:10,106
from an older audience that likes non-VR games to one that is in VR as well.

104
00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:14,030
So looking into the research that my team has been doing,

105
00:05:14,391 --> 00:05:16,913
I think we've got a pretty good idea of how to achieve this.

106
00:05:17,433 --> 00:05:19,015
And frankly, it comes down to two items

107
00:05:19,115 --> 00:05:20,316
that will be familiar to the people

108
00:05:20,336 --> 00:05:21,417
who saw my talk last year.

109
00:05:22,177 --> 00:05:23,298
The first one is access.

110
00:05:23,859 --> 00:05:25,860
Last year, I actually talked about accessibility instead,

111
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,342
but I'm using access here as an umbrella term

112
00:05:28,863 --> 00:05:30,444
for concepts such as accessibility,

113
00:05:30,464 --> 00:05:32,466
but also learning, control, and safety.

114
00:05:33,246 --> 00:05:35,768
VR employs relatively new ways of controlling games,

115
00:05:35,848 --> 00:05:37,490
so these factors play a bigger role

116
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,912
than they did last year for non-VR games.

117
00:05:41,153 --> 00:05:44,074
Then there's content. That's similar to last year.

118
00:05:44,194 --> 00:05:47,557
I also discussed there how to make games for older adults that are meaningful,

119
00:05:47,577 --> 00:05:50,779
that are interesting, and that are perceived as useful to them.

120
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:53,560
And then finally, my third category is new.

121
00:05:54,541 --> 00:06:01,725
It's context, and this, because both previous factors rely heavily on social parameters,

122
00:06:02,206 --> 00:06:04,907
I felt that I should emphasize that, and I turned it into a third section.

123
00:06:05,027 --> 00:06:08,409
So, we're going to explore all three of these.

124
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:13,751
and hopefully provide you with everything you need at this time to make great VR games for older adults.

125
00:06:13,931 --> 00:06:16,332
So, let's start with Access.

126
00:06:19,493 --> 00:06:21,734
So, first some hardware notes, I guess.

127
00:06:21,994 --> 00:06:24,595
Obviously, VR hardware differs significantly.

128
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:28,517
And not all the recommendations that I'm going to make today apply to each of these systems.

129
00:06:28,557 --> 00:06:34,739
In fact, in my lab we tried out the Gear VR, the Oculus Rift DK2 and the HTC Vive with older adults so far.

130
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,682
That being said, when it comes to the hardware itself, we only ran into two minor issues.

131
00:06:39,922 --> 00:06:45,965
The first one being with regards to the Gear VR, a few participants had poor eyesight

132
00:06:46,265 --> 00:06:49,107
and we couldn't offer them a solution to see clearly in the device.

133
00:06:49,687 --> 00:06:54,390
Their glasses were either too big or the optical adjustments weren't strong enough and we

134
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:55,791
were kind of caught in between those.

135
00:06:55,951 --> 00:07:00,354
So that's an issue that might occur with other headsets as well, but in the tests we did

136
00:07:00,394 --> 00:07:01,935
it only happened with the Gear VR.

137
00:07:02,415 --> 00:07:02,555
So... .

138
00:07:03,813 --> 00:07:04,934
Thought that was interesting to mention.

139
00:07:05,735 --> 00:07:09,058
Second, most of the participants that came into the lab

140
00:07:09,078 --> 00:07:10,959
were expecting something way more lightweight

141
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:12,260
than what we currently have on offer,

142
00:07:12,961 --> 00:07:14,662
and something that's much more easy to use as well.

143
00:07:15,203 --> 00:07:18,045
So modern day headsets feel kind of bulky to them,

144
00:07:18,065 --> 00:07:19,366
especially the room-sized ones.

145
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:21,208
And while it wasn't a huge issues

146
00:07:21,228 --> 00:07:22,409
for reasons that I'll explain in a bit,

147
00:07:23,149 --> 00:07:24,550
we did get some complaints about it,

148
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,932
and I think it might get in the way of some people

149
00:07:27,993 --> 00:07:29,995
investing in a VR system at this point in time.

150
00:07:30,775 --> 00:07:40,286
Now, moving from hardware to software though, all of the systems that we tested led to a number of recommendations that pertain to how our balance, our vision, our hearing, and our skills change as we age.

151
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:45,552
So, let's look at these and I'll start with balance because a lot of VR seems to be heading towards embodied experiences.

152
00:07:46,435 --> 00:07:49,577
So balance is basically a function of three things.

153
00:07:49,817 --> 00:07:51,198
You've got your proprioception, which

154
00:07:51,278 --> 00:07:52,639
is your unconscious sense of where

155
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:54,860
the different parts of your body are in relation to each other.

156
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,241
There's a vestibular system in your inner ear

157
00:07:57,281 --> 00:07:58,782
that provides you with a sense of balance

158
00:07:58,822 --> 00:07:59,803
and spatial orientation.

159
00:08:00,183 --> 00:08:00,803
And there's vision.

160
00:08:00,843 --> 00:08:02,744
And well, you guys are all using it right now,

161
00:08:02,764 --> 00:08:04,225
so I'm sure you are aware what that is.

162
00:08:05,926 --> 00:08:09,569
These three put together allow us to move through spaces without falling over, but when

163
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:12,591
they're out of sync, we tend to feel nauseous, for example.

164
00:08:13,051 --> 00:08:17,655
If your vision sees movement and your vestibular system doesn't pick up any, you might experience

165
00:08:17,675 --> 00:08:21,178
simulation sickness that VR developers have been working so hard on to avoid over the

166
00:08:21,218 --> 00:08:21,698
past years.

167
00:08:22,358 --> 00:08:25,621
Now, I'm not going to get into simulation sickness in this talk at all.

168
00:08:25,661 --> 00:08:30,845
I think it has been documented well, and there's many ways to avoid or circumvent it, in particular

169
00:08:30,865 --> 00:08:32,106
the things that you'll see on this slide.

170
00:08:34,652 --> 00:08:36,714
Yeah, so with that being said,

171
00:08:36,754 --> 00:08:37,895
obviously there's way more to it

172
00:08:37,915 --> 00:08:39,217
than just these five bullet points,

173
00:08:39,677 --> 00:08:42,120
and I recommend reading the link at the bottom,

174
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,463
which is an article by Ben Lewis Evans on Gamma Sutra

175
00:08:44,503 --> 00:08:46,045
that goes into depth in this topic.

176
00:08:46,606 --> 00:08:48,227
Now, for older adults though,

177
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,650
we need to look further than this,

178
00:08:51,491 --> 00:08:52,773
and we need to be aware of the following.

179
00:08:53,554 --> 00:08:59,259
So proprioception, well, your nerve density in your peripheral nervous system starts to decline in your 40s.

180
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,422
The nerves in your vestibular system decline around 55,

181
00:09:02,983 --> 00:09:08,789
and a lot of people will start to get vision issues, minor ones at first, after 40.

182
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:12,190
You take all that, you combine it with your response times

183
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:15,271
already being on decline after you hit 25 years old,

184
00:09:16,231 --> 00:09:19,272
and you can imagine that, well, as soon as you hit your 40s,

185
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:21,812
you will see a steady decline in balance tests,

186
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:24,293
and your balance will just deteriorate because of it.

187
00:09:25,293 --> 00:09:27,614
So to compensate for this, older adults

188
00:09:27,654 --> 00:09:30,474
rely more on their vision than on their proprioceptive system.

189
00:09:31,015 --> 00:09:32,795
And as you all know, vision is the thing

190
00:09:32,815 --> 00:09:34,675
that we're really going to be messing with when we're

191
00:09:34,695 --> 00:09:36,236
making VR experiences for them.

192
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:38,496
So here is what I suggest we do.

193
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:42,480
The easiest one, of course, is allow for people to sit down.

194
00:09:43,261 --> 00:09:45,223
We tried that in our lab. It worked marvelously.

195
00:09:45,644 --> 00:09:47,706
We just gave them a chair with wheels at the bottom.

196
00:09:47,746 --> 00:09:49,588
Not a wheelchair, but just a chair with tiny little wheels.

197
00:09:50,009 --> 00:09:52,432
And it works fine for room-sized VR like the Vive.

198
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:54,935
We had people drive a chair through Paris and they loved it.

199
00:09:56,356 --> 00:09:59,138
That being said though, I think we need to, as an industry,

200
00:09:59,158 --> 00:10:01,759
look into how we can bring assistive devices into VR.

201
00:10:01,939 --> 00:10:04,581
You know, if the five tracker can bring in a gun

202
00:10:04,621 --> 00:10:06,682
or a baseball bat, well, why not a walking cane?

203
00:10:07,442 --> 00:10:09,684
And then finally, design for spotters.

204
00:10:10,544 --> 00:10:13,066
We helped with the cable management for our participants

205
00:10:13,086 --> 00:10:15,747
or provided them an arm to hang onto if they needed it.

206
00:10:16,388 --> 00:10:19,589
So keep in mind that older adults might need somebody else

207
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,310
with them in the space to actually enjoy

208
00:10:21,351 --> 00:10:22,531
what you're developing for them.

209
00:10:23,232 --> 00:10:29,335
So that's my first point. Second, not everybody can duck, lean, and kneel efficiently like a younger person could.

210
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:36,759
So the fantastic contraption actually does an excellent job with this by allowing players to scale the game world and play it in a less embodied way.

211
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:44,084
In the standard scale, we had a lot of issues with our participants just getting down on the floor and trying to build the contraptions for the puzzles.

212
00:10:44,824 --> 00:10:51,168
But moving it to desk scale fixed a lot of these issues. So, yeah, readjusting the scale can be very helpful.

213
00:10:52,571 --> 00:10:55,873
And then I have three recommendations that were less relevant in the short test that we did,

214
00:10:55,913 --> 00:10:59,095
but that you will see if you have people play for a longer period of time.

215
00:10:59,696 --> 00:11:02,938
First of all, try to avoid movements that require balance shifting,

216
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:05,279
because, well, that's asking for trouble, obviously.

217
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:09,102
Second, implement enough resting time to accommodate fatigue.

218
00:11:09,662 --> 00:11:11,744
I'll have a comment about that later in the talk as well, but...

219
00:11:12,404 --> 00:11:15,706
If you do an embodied game, you get way more tired than when you're using a controller.

220
00:11:16,406 --> 00:11:18,667
And I recommend that players use a hard surface.

221
00:11:18,687 --> 00:11:22,769
We have a hard surface in the lab, but if you're playing on a carpet, it's easier for you to sway and fall over.

222
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:28,391
So, those are my recommendations for balance, and that will help us avoid any nasty falls, hopefully.

223
00:11:29,211 --> 00:11:31,672
Let's look at vision, hearing, cognition, and some other things.

224
00:11:33,173 --> 00:11:41,700
If you remember last year's talk, the reason why this is important is because surveys showed that between 35 and 50% of 65 plus year olds reported disability.

225
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:45,804
So this is a huge market segment really and they need some adjustments to play VR games.

226
00:11:46,444 --> 00:11:47,725
So for Vision, well...

227
00:11:48,406 --> 00:11:51,688
A lot of the recommendations I made in last year's talk actually just carry over and just

228
00:11:51,728 --> 00:11:56,132
apply to VR as well, like larger font sizes, higher contrast, all these things are still

229
00:11:56,172 --> 00:11:56,732
very welcome.

230
00:11:57,293 --> 00:12:03,157
The specific recommendation that we saw is with devices like the Gear VR, if you can't

231
00:12:03,297 --> 00:12:07,880
see really well, you can sit closer to a screen, but that's difficult to do if the screen is

232
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,881
stationary in front of you.

233
00:12:08,921 --> 00:12:14,205
So allowing options so that people can get closer to menus and to objects are really

234
00:12:14,245 --> 00:12:14,525
helpful.

235
00:12:15,886 --> 00:12:20,568
For hearing, again, a lot of optimizations like the ones we have for non-VR games,

236
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,828
make sure you're in the right frequencies,

237
00:12:22,848 --> 00:12:24,329
adjust words per minute and so forth.

238
00:12:25,149 --> 00:12:28,470
But I think the biggest challenge for VR there are probably the subtitles.

239
00:12:29,271 --> 00:12:31,671
Now, I'm not going to get into the details of how this work,

240
00:12:31,691 --> 00:12:34,252
but if you just use typical subtitles like you'd have in the movie,

241
00:12:34,672 --> 00:12:36,453
it becomes very disorienting in VR.

242
00:12:37,233 --> 00:12:39,094
So the best solution that I've seen so far,

243
00:12:39,194 --> 00:12:41,054
I think is the one that you have involves tutorial.

244
00:12:42,115 --> 00:12:44,216
They give each character a speech bubble,

245
00:12:44,537 --> 00:12:46,318
and if you combine that with a visual indicator

246
00:12:46,338 --> 00:12:47,339
of where people need to look,

247
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,821
I think that's probably the best thing

248
00:12:49,841 --> 00:12:52,003
that we've got so far until we see a better solution for it.

249
00:12:52,843 --> 00:12:56,286
So, finally, we've got cognition and other adjustments.

250
00:12:57,407 --> 00:12:58,728
And a lot of these things come down

251
00:12:58,788 --> 00:13:00,349
to allowing for customization.

252
00:13:00,469 --> 00:13:02,691
From non-VR games, we have adjustments

253
00:13:02,731 --> 00:13:04,092
for slower reaction speeds

254
00:13:04,172 --> 00:13:05,453
or adjusting your input controls.

255
00:13:06,454 --> 00:13:08,516
And for VR, well, if you're using motion controls,

256
00:13:09,116 --> 00:13:13,979
Allow older adults to customize how much leeway there is in the game's motion input.

257
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:19,482
Because they might need very coarse movements or they might have a tremble that you don't want to interfere with their input.

258
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:25,866
Anyways, there's another Gamasutra article that goes into depth on all these topics if you'd like some additional information for it.

259
00:13:26,486 --> 00:13:31,269
So most of these recommendations are about adjusting the interface to meet the abilities of your players.

260
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:34,151
And that brings me to a point that I made last year as well.

261
00:13:35,112 --> 00:13:40,015
You should always think about adjusting the interface, but never the challenge. Just look at this guy.

262
00:13:41,796 --> 00:13:42,256
All right.

263
00:13:49,012 --> 00:13:52,335
I would not want to pick a fight with that guy and neither do you want to give him a

264
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:55,818
less challenging version of the game just because he looks older than most of you do

265
00:13:55,858 --> 00:13:56,278
in this room.

266
00:13:57,739 --> 00:14:00,142
That's one of the reasons why the talk is called Beyond Ageism.

267
00:14:00,182 --> 00:14:05,346
There's no reason why you shouldn't expect older adults to be willing to get into a full

268
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,867
contact zombie battle in VR.

269
00:14:09,076 --> 00:14:12,139
So age does not necessarily make somebody frail or boring.

270
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,185
So there are plenty of older adults who are still capable of getting into something like

271
00:14:17,205 --> 00:14:17,385
this.

272
00:14:17,525 --> 00:14:21,769
So I always say adjust the interface, but please don't dumb down the challenge that

273
00:14:21,789 --> 00:14:22,390
you're providing.

274
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:25,854
And that was actually my golden rule last year with regards to accessibility.

275
00:14:26,314 --> 00:14:28,737
However, for VR I feel that I needed a different golden rule.

276
00:14:30,118 --> 00:14:35,179
And this says, this new technology is extremely important that you inform your audience what to expect.

277
00:14:35,219 --> 00:14:40,781
For example, for more physical VR games, you want to be careful with the motion that you're requesting of players as injuries can happen.

278
00:14:41,241 --> 00:14:48,863
So it's essential that you indicate what these motions are going to be so people can make informed decisions before they buy your game and they really know what they're getting themselves into.

279
00:14:50,184 --> 00:14:55,127
Of course, that also means informing caregivers, and that brings me to a short anecdote from

280
00:14:55,147 --> 00:14:55,907
the study that we did.

281
00:14:56,708 --> 00:15:00,671
As we happened to have two people with mild cognitive impairment, which is an early stage

282
00:15:00,711 --> 00:15:01,811
of dementia, in our sample.

283
00:15:02,572 --> 00:15:06,995
Now we didn't notice, and neither did our caregivers, until we noticed how they couldn't

284
00:15:07,015 --> 00:15:11,718
differentiate between the real world and the VR world, which if you think of it is really

285
00:15:11,738 --> 00:15:14,900
scary because all of a sudden there's a real Tyrannosaurus Rex right in front of you.

286
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:20,305
So we cut the demo short obviously, but this is something to be mindful of,

287
00:15:20,346 --> 00:15:23,489
because there's a lot of ethical considerations with that,

288
00:15:23,549 --> 00:15:28,153
and MCI seems to show up even more so in VR games than in regular games.

289
00:15:29,234 --> 00:15:31,517
So those are my comments for access.

290
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:33,599
Let's have a look at content.

291
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,702
And I'd like to open that topic by addressing usefulness.

292
00:15:38,133 --> 00:15:42,375
Because if you think of games that are useful for older adults, you probably think of the brain games and the XR games.

293
00:15:42,395 --> 00:15:47,357
And if you were here last year, I really went on a rant about how brain training games are ages,

294
00:15:47,437 --> 00:15:51,878
because they're focusing on the negative side of aging and they explore stereotypes and fear of aging for profit.

295
00:15:52,539 --> 00:15:55,620
Now, this argument can obviously be made for XR games as well.

296
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,101
And, well, the link down below refers to a lit review.

297
00:15:59,461 --> 00:16:02,883
The research on XR gaming for older adults is currently still inconclusive.

298
00:16:02,923 --> 00:16:05,764
We don't have enough evidence to demonstrate that they work very well.

299
00:16:06,425 --> 00:16:11,991
So, with that being said though, I do want to point out that one, older adults care a

300
00:16:12,051 --> 00:16:14,154
whole lot about spending their time in a useful manner.

301
00:16:14,775 --> 00:16:19,640
And two, perceived usefulness for any audience is an extremely important concept in why people

302
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,243
adopt new technologies, which is what we're dealing with here right now.

303
00:16:22,964 --> 00:16:26,445
So my suggestion is here that as an industry, it's all about thinking about how we can make

304
00:16:26,545 --> 00:16:30,686
extra games and brain games that are not exploiting these things or using these stereotypes.

305
00:16:31,126 --> 00:16:33,466
And I think that's something we could reasonably do.

306
00:16:34,407 --> 00:16:39,868
For example, when I had older adults try a space pirate trainer, which is awesome, many

307
00:16:39,888 --> 00:16:43,649
of them commented on how good of a workout it was and the headset would just be covered

308
00:16:43,689 --> 00:16:44,809
in sweat when we took it off.

309
00:16:45,449 --> 00:16:49,934
Now, I can't academically back it up that this is a good exercise for older adults,

310
00:16:49,994 --> 00:16:55,580
but getting people to move and doing an exercise that they usually wouldn't do is not really a bad idea, I would argue.

311
00:16:56,241 --> 00:17:00,686
So, here is my approach on how to leverage usefulness as a design goal for older adults,

312
00:17:00,826 --> 00:17:02,668
and I talked about this last year as well.

313
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,031
This is what I see in my research a whole lot.

314
00:17:06,171 --> 00:17:08,152
Older adults request innovative gameplay,

315
00:17:08,172 --> 00:17:09,773
thought-provoking themes, emotional,

316
00:17:10,434 --> 00:17:12,375
meaningful dialogue, and aesthetic experiences.

317
00:17:13,255 --> 00:17:14,096
Or, like one

318
00:17:14,176 --> 00:17:15,917
person on Twitter put it, games that are

319
00:17:15,977 --> 00:17:17,518
really fun. And,

320
00:17:17,898 --> 00:17:19,920
that's exactly what a lot of games that are designed for

321
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,881
older adults are often still lacking. So,

322
00:17:22,381 --> 00:17:24,022
let's explore some of the things that

323
00:17:24,062 --> 00:17:25,943
I saw in the games that we tested with older adults

324
00:17:25,983 --> 00:17:27,905
in terms of their content, and maybe this will

325
00:17:27,925 --> 00:17:30,046
inspire someone out there to make awesome

326
00:17:30,086 --> 00:17:31,967
extra games. So, let's start

327
00:17:32,027 --> 00:17:32,968
with the number one.

328
00:17:33,368 --> 00:17:35,849
VR experience for older adults that's currently out there.

329
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,591
It's Google Earth VR.

330
00:17:39,271 --> 00:17:43,114
And now I know, according to your definition, not a game,

331
00:17:43,134 --> 00:17:43,434
Bob.

332
00:17:43,954 --> 00:17:46,876
Well, according to mine, Google Earth VR is an

333
00:17:46,936 --> 00:17:49,518
exploration sandbox borderline VR game experience.

334
00:17:50,218 --> 00:17:52,840
And every older adult that we tested this with loved it.

335
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,741
Now, aside from the obvious usefulness and educational

336
00:17:55,821 --> 00:17:58,103
value, what makes this so interesting, in my opinion, is

337
00:17:58,123 --> 00:18:00,644
that it's a reminiscing machine like nothing I've ever seen

338
00:18:00,684 --> 00:18:00,964
before.

339
00:18:01,905 --> 00:18:05,467
And reminiscing actually has a whole lot of positive health effects for older adults.

340
00:18:05,487 --> 00:18:10,409
So the takeaway here is that just by looking and exploring places, especially familiar ones,

341
00:18:10,849 --> 00:18:13,811
we actually have a very useful and meaningful mechanic for this audience.

342
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:17,653
Now, that being said, this test was not all positive,

343
00:18:17,673 --> 00:18:21,674
though the interface was still really cumbersome for people with little game experience

344
00:18:21,714 --> 00:18:23,375
and they struggled a whole lot to move around.

345
00:18:23,815 --> 00:18:28,558
I actually had to put some people on the non-interactive welcome tour of the software, and they did

346
00:18:28,578 --> 00:18:31,460
enjoy that tremendously, but then you take the interactivity out of it.

347
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:37,063
So perhaps there is an opportunity there for a guided tour VR thing for older adults maybe.

348
00:18:37,223 --> 00:18:37,503
I don't know.

349
00:18:38,944 --> 00:18:41,445
And that brings me to a specific VR genre, I guess.

350
00:18:42,466 --> 00:18:47,688
I call it looking around games, and by this I mean experiences that are just about being somewhere else.

351
00:18:47,968 --> 00:18:53,930
Whether it's seeing a dinosaur come to life in Jurassic World demo, or visiting a Cirque du Soleil show, or seeing a blue whale pass by,

352
00:18:54,351 --> 00:18:58,632
just looking around works as a great mechanic for this audience.

353
00:18:59,633 --> 00:19:02,354
And from my experience, the cream of the crop would be games like

354
00:19:02,394 --> 00:19:04,195
Dumpy Going Elephants or Sideline the Chair,

355
00:19:04,236 --> 00:19:06,557
where your gaze is actually how you interact with the world.

356
00:19:07,277 --> 00:19:09,679
For example, Sideline the Chair, you know, the game changes

357
00:19:10,219 --> 00:19:11,500
in the places where you're not looking.

358
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,982
And my older adults mentioned that a whole lot as well.

359
00:19:15,962 --> 00:19:17,683
A lot of them mentioned that it was way more fun

360
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:20,024
if there's some sort of interaction in these games,

361
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,966
whether it's just the environment responding to your presence,

362
00:19:23,026 --> 00:19:25,468
like fish swimming away if you get too close in the blue.

363
00:19:27,088 --> 00:19:31,870
Moving on, another demo that was really successful is this one in The Lab by Valve.

364
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:36,191
You get to play fetch with a robot dog, and that worked so well.

365
00:19:36,211 --> 00:19:41,633
I mean, when I did it, I got bored of it after five minutes, but my older adults just could do this for very long times,

366
00:19:41,693 --> 00:19:44,214
and I was really surprised at how much they got out of it.

367
00:19:44,714 --> 00:19:51,196
So the takeaway here is that building a social connection with a virtual or maybe real-life character is another mechanic that seems to work really well.

368
00:19:52,036 --> 00:19:55,857
Furthermore, when we think about learning VR games, this gameplay is extremely familiar

369
00:19:55,937 --> 00:19:58,718
and people figure it out without needing any instruction.

370
00:19:58,778 --> 00:20:02,879
So I would argue that designing for recognition is a great way to get older adults to learn

371
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:03,719
your game faster.

372
00:20:04,499 --> 00:20:10,061
For example, in the fantastic contraption, to move from one mode to the next, all you

373
00:20:10,081 --> 00:20:11,901
do is you pick up a helmet and you put it on your head.

374
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:14,142
And since it's a helmet, oh yeah, this is something I put on my head.

375
00:20:14,742 --> 00:20:16,384
In the lab itself, it's just a sphere.

376
00:20:16,684 --> 00:20:18,385
And it's the same interaction,

377
00:20:18,786 --> 00:20:21,388
but just putting a sphere on your head or putting a helmet on your head

378
00:20:21,448 --> 00:20:24,690
is completely different than the amount of help we have to provide older adults

379
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:26,572
to figure out how the interface actually works.

380
00:20:26,612 --> 00:20:28,453
So, recognition is really important.

381
00:20:29,014 --> 00:20:32,777
And these are my four main takeaways that work for every older adult that...

382
00:20:34,018 --> 00:20:38,384
we tested with. So exploring places reminiscing social interaction and recognition are important.

383
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:45,373
Now, these are all recommendations for a general older audience. When I got my experienced

384
00:20:45,413 --> 00:20:50,259
group of older gamers, the Oxford Adult Gamers Club, in the mix, the design space just opened

385
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:52,582
up. And the most popular game for that group

386
00:20:53,678 --> 00:20:58,200
was the Brookhaven experiment. So a really tense zombie shooter game.

387
00:20:58,681 --> 00:21:03,023
Now, I do admit in the tests that we did, we didn't have any female players come in.

388
00:21:03,063 --> 00:21:07,585
Sometimes we have them, sometimes we don't. So this might be a little bit gender biased,

389
00:21:07,745 --> 00:21:11,746
but the older adults that we tested these games with wanted something more action oriented

390
00:21:11,766 --> 00:21:12,847
and Brookhaven was a hit.

391
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,682
They liked that it felt like an actual game.

392
00:21:17,863 --> 00:21:19,404
And that's a comment I've heard a couple of times,

393
00:21:19,464 --> 00:21:21,345
while a lot of the VR things didn't really feel

394
00:21:21,365 --> 00:21:22,085
as much as a game.

395
00:21:22,706 --> 00:21:24,327
And they like to shoot and kill things.

396
00:21:25,127 --> 00:21:27,469
Whether it was the archery game that you'll find in the

397
00:21:27,509 --> 00:21:29,170
lab, the slingshot that you'll find in the lab, or

398
00:21:29,971 --> 00:21:33,513
space pirate trainer, this is a mechanic that works for an

399
00:21:34,174 --> 00:21:35,114
older gamer audience.

400
00:21:35,655 --> 00:21:37,856
Now, obviously, I tried some other games as well.

401
00:21:39,426 --> 00:21:41,668
But I was really disappointed with how it turned out.

402
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:45,892
I had such high expectations, but Job Simulator, the fantastic contraption,

403
00:21:46,673 --> 00:21:50,477
they liked them for a while, and they certainly got some laughs out of it,

404
00:21:51,037 --> 00:21:55,482
but they didn't really want to keep playing it like they did with the shooting games,

405
00:21:55,682 --> 00:21:59,966
and they felt in particular that the art style was too weird and too childish.

406
00:22:00,787 --> 00:22:06,553
A more lifelike art style, like what you'll see in Valve's lab, works fine,

407
00:22:06,693 --> 00:22:11,438
but when you go into the really cartoony stuff, it's kind of off-putting for 60-plus-year-olds, I guess.

408
00:22:14,023 --> 00:22:17,126
Those are my notes I have on content, which brings us to context.

409
00:22:18,127 --> 00:22:24,132
Now, I'm nearing the end of the talk here, and we've actually already discussed a lot of social factors.

410
00:22:24,652 --> 00:22:27,735
For example, I talked about how spotters can help you make a game playable,

411
00:22:27,815 --> 00:22:29,356
how social interaction really matters,

412
00:22:29,776 --> 00:22:32,078
I hinted at the importance of intergenerational play,

413
00:22:32,218 --> 00:22:35,221
or how you want to inform caregivers about what to expect in a game.

414
00:22:36,222 --> 00:22:40,345
And aside from that, it really comes down to designing games that fit in the daily lives

415
00:22:40,665 --> 00:22:42,227
and the life history of older adults.

416
00:22:43,688 --> 00:22:47,809
And I would argue that there are very few differences there between VR games and non-VR games,

417
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:51,271
so I addressed all of these pretty extensively in the talk last year.

418
00:22:51,811 --> 00:22:55,513
More specifically, we looked at five different motivational profiles,

419
00:22:55,573 --> 00:22:59,315
we looked at how you can extend MDA with aesthetics specifically for this audience,

420
00:22:59,755 --> 00:23:04,837
we looked at the life history boxes, the cost-benefits analysis of play, and how intelligence changes.

421
00:23:05,457 --> 00:23:07,458
So instead of just doing a complete rehash,

422
00:23:07,778 --> 00:23:10,780
I decided to provide you with a link of my talk last year

423
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,421
on the wrap-up slide and simply get to my conclusion.

424
00:23:14,221 --> 00:23:18,684
So in conclusion, I do see a bright future for VR

425
00:23:18,724 --> 00:23:19,464
for older adults.

426
00:23:20,905 --> 00:23:23,586
The way I think of it, VR is a transformative technology

427
00:23:24,466 --> 00:23:26,768
similar to the Internet or a smartphone.

428
00:23:27,668 --> 00:23:30,309
It's definitely going to change how we do a whole lot of things

429
00:23:30,349 --> 00:23:31,990
and it's drastically going to change how we age.

430
00:23:33,151 --> 00:23:37,013
Correspondingly, I see a lot of opportunities for playful VR

431
00:23:37,273 --> 00:23:39,174
activities and games aimed at older adults,

432
00:23:39,955 --> 00:23:41,035
similar to non-VR games.

433
00:23:41,556 --> 00:23:43,577
But we have to be really mindful of their specific

434
00:23:43,637 --> 00:23:44,557
needs and wishes.

435
00:23:44,657 --> 00:23:46,718
And we still have a pretty long way to

436
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:47,959
go to accomplish that.

437
00:23:47,999 --> 00:23:50,641
We're basically just at the beginning of this, obviously.

438
00:23:51,241 --> 00:23:52,922
So thanks so much for having me.

439
00:23:53,082 --> 00:23:55,323
If you like the talk, please fill out the review forms.

440
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,185
And I guess I'm ready for questions then.

441
00:23:58,165 --> 00:23:58,405
Thank you.

442
00:24:15,585 --> 00:24:18,066
What would you think would differ for AR HoloLens

443
00:24:18,086 --> 00:24:21,847
environment versus VR?

444
00:24:21,867 --> 00:24:25,149
Well, with the HoloLens at this point, well, I haven't

445
00:24:25,189 --> 00:24:26,169
tested it at all with them.

446
00:24:26,209 --> 00:24:29,010
So it's a really hard question to answer, because I hate just

447
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:31,051
talking from my own experiences.

448
00:24:33,492 --> 00:24:35,173
I don't think I've got a good answer for that question at

449
00:24:35,193 --> 00:24:35,873
this point, actually.

450
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:37,114
I think I really need to test it.

451
00:24:38,774 --> 00:24:40,575
Yeah, I'm just going to stay on the safe side of that one.

452
00:24:40,615 --> 00:24:40,795
Sorry.

453
00:24:44,214 --> 00:24:47,382
Human factors, ergonomics, and hygiene, have you looked at any of those?

454
00:24:48,847 --> 00:24:53,188
Well, in our lab we typically look more into the content and go more into accessibility.

455
00:24:53,629 --> 00:24:58,830
For ergonomics, I think it comes down to the things that I mentioned with the kneeling

456
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:00,630
and all those things in the accessibility part of it.

457
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:02,171
Those are the things that we could perceive.

458
00:25:02,631 --> 00:25:05,431
We don't do any formal standardized testing on those things.

459
00:25:07,092 --> 00:25:11,053
With hygiene, we wipe off the headsets and everything because there's a lot of sweat

460
00:25:11,113 --> 00:25:14,013
oftentimes, especially with things like the Space Pirate Trainer.

461
00:25:17,547 --> 00:25:18,608
Go ahead.

462
00:25:19,128 --> 00:25:19,529
Great talk.

463
00:25:19,549 --> 00:25:20,129
Thank you so much.

464
00:25:21,691 --> 00:25:24,995
I was wondering about how long onboarding tended to take in

465
00:25:25,035 --> 00:25:28,719
terms of bringing an older adult up to speed on how the

466
00:25:30,601 --> 00:25:31,602
VR application was going to work.

467
00:25:32,142 --> 00:25:32,903
Can you repeat that?

468
00:25:32,923 --> 00:25:33,143
Sure.

469
00:25:33,484 --> 00:25:34,204
Yeah, sorry.

470
00:25:34,365 --> 00:25:35,266
Just about onboarding.

471
00:25:35,326 --> 00:25:41,272
How long it took an older adult to get familiar with the hardware and VR and sort of what

472
00:25:41,532 --> 00:25:41,712
that is.

473
00:25:41,812 --> 00:25:42,994
About how long that took you.

474
00:25:43,014 --> 00:25:44,235
Yeah, that's a great question.

475
00:25:44,856 --> 00:25:47,578
So how long does it take for them to pick these things up, basically?

476
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:54,764
We always provide some assistance obviously. But I have to say Valve does a really good job with

477
00:25:54,864 --> 00:26:01,149
that tutorial. So we typically had them run through that first and after that tutorial they

478
00:26:01,169 --> 00:26:06,253
needed a little bit of help left and right. But it was way easier than what we get with most

479
00:26:06,553 --> 00:26:12,537
video games, non-VR games. Now with, say, the Gear VR we had some extensive training for

480
00:26:12,557 --> 00:26:17,781
them. So we had like a protocol on how you put this thing on and everything.

481
00:26:18,482 --> 00:26:20,863
We made sure that they're at ease and all that kind of stuff.

482
00:26:20,903 --> 00:26:23,964
So, because that was also part of a research study, so we had

483
00:26:24,004 --> 00:26:24,384
to do that.

484
00:26:24,404 --> 00:26:29,165
So, with the Gear VR, the interface on the site could be

485
00:26:29,185 --> 00:26:29,746
a little tricky.

486
00:26:29,766 --> 00:26:32,327
It'd take them a while to actually just find that thing.

487
00:26:33,687 --> 00:26:36,188
But outside of that, I don't think we saw too many issues,

488
00:26:36,228 --> 00:26:37,028
like I said earlier.

489
00:26:37,068 --> 00:26:40,529
I mean, it's just, they get good instructions because we, you

490
00:26:40,549 --> 00:26:42,990
know, like I said, we're looking for content more than we are

491
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:44,811
testing the hardware itself, I'd say.

492
00:26:45,531 --> 00:26:45,811
Thank you.

493
00:26:46,031 --> 00:26:46,432
Oh, you're welcome.

494
00:26:48,612 --> 00:26:48,712
Hi.

495
00:26:49,173 --> 00:26:50,054
Again, great talk.

496
00:26:50,214 --> 00:26:50,955
Thanks so much.

497
00:26:51,335 --> 00:26:53,978
I guess I have an observation slash question.

498
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:59,564
Throughout my career in tech, not just in games, co-workers

499
00:26:59,644 --> 00:27:03,168
refer to grandma, like we want an interface that grandma can

500
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:06,552
use, or saying, well, we're not looking for grandma to

501
00:27:06,612 --> 00:27:07,372
play this game.

502
00:27:09,054 --> 00:27:14,517
Also, I would observe that in articles that we see and even in

503
00:27:14,577 --> 00:27:18,899
parts of your talk today, there are very stereotypically older

504
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:25,141
looking adults who actually look more like 70 and 75.

505
00:27:26,822 --> 00:27:29,603
Younger people might say, wow, look at the funny clothes, the

506
00:27:29,643 --> 00:27:33,665
golf outfits, how wrinkly they are, the white hair and so on.

507
00:27:33,725 --> 00:27:36,106
Wow, they're probably frail and tremble and stuff.

508
00:27:37,127 --> 00:27:41,512
But I think that distances us developers from them.

509
00:27:42,072 --> 00:27:43,754
That makes them more other.

510
00:27:45,756 --> 00:27:47,778
And I just wonder what your thoughts are on that.

511
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:53,180
My point of view is coming from that of a user experience

512
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:56,741
designer and user advocate who is 52 years old.

513
00:27:57,241 --> 00:28:00,763
And so I see a little bit of distancing.

514
00:28:00,803 --> 00:28:03,605
And I also see kind of a gap there between the 20

515
00:28:03,965 --> 00:28:07,046
somethings and 30 somethings who make games and this notion

516
00:28:07,086 --> 00:28:09,507
that all these people are white haired and frail.

517
00:28:10,848 --> 00:28:17,010
I completely agree. First off, with the visuals that are in the talk, I can obviously not use our

518
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:22,732
actual participants for anonymity and privacy. So I just fix things off the internet. You do

519
00:28:22,792 --> 00:28:28,834
tend to get a very stereotypical image that way. It's just really hard to avoid. But with that

520
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:32,755
in mind, yeah, I think last year I was talking about only 1% of the industry is over 50.

521
00:28:34,756 --> 00:28:38,158
I think there's definitely a disconnect there.

522
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:41,940
Oftentimes, we do things at Miami where we bring our

523
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,061
students in on workshops where they have to design things

524
00:28:44,101 --> 00:28:44,982
intergenerationally.

525
00:28:45,582 --> 00:28:49,164
I think that helps a lot for the students that do that.

526
00:28:49,945 --> 00:28:52,186
The distance just becomes a lot, lot smaller when you

527
00:28:52,226 --> 00:28:54,767
actually have to collaborate with somebody and make

528
00:28:54,787 --> 00:28:56,108
something that will work for both of you.

529
00:28:57,449 --> 00:28:59,290
So yeah, those are my thoughts on that.

530
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:00,971
Does that answer you?

531
00:29:02,151 --> 00:29:02,332
Great.

532
00:29:03,152 --> 00:29:03,392
Go ahead.

533
00:29:04,204 --> 00:29:06,266
Hi, I'm 72.

534
00:29:09,608 --> 00:29:11,950
This hasn't really turned into, as you've pointed out

535
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:14,011
real well, into a mass market yet.

536
00:29:14,412 --> 00:29:19,155
Any additional thoughts on how to reach the seniors?

537
00:29:19,616 --> 00:29:21,917
For a younger generation, it's easy.

538
00:29:21,957 --> 00:29:23,518
They're reading gamer magazines.

539
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:26,841
They're right in the middle of all that.

540
00:29:27,381 --> 00:29:31,484
How do you reach the senior population other than taking

541
00:29:31,584 --> 00:29:33,506
out massive ads and AARP?

542
00:29:34,171 --> 00:29:41,199
Yeah, well the AARP actually came up to me at some point saying they have a lot of people

543
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:45,204
on the website looking for games specifically. I mean they actually see this in their search

544
00:29:45,244 --> 00:29:47,026
terms apparently. Excuse me.

545
00:29:48,627 --> 00:29:52,249
What I see with many older adults is that their online

546
00:29:52,309 --> 00:29:53,550
diet is slightly different.

547
00:29:53,851 --> 00:29:56,693
There are still a lot of people who use forums to look

548
00:29:56,733 --> 00:30:00,235
for games, while younger audiences typically use things

549
00:30:00,255 --> 00:30:00,676
like Reddit.

550
00:30:02,077 --> 00:30:03,138
Facebook works as well.

551
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:07,461
I think for my own research, it's always been easiest to

552
00:30:07,521 --> 00:30:09,843
find people through online communities to participate.

553
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:11,984
Let's see.

554
00:30:14,887 --> 00:30:18,190
Well, I had another one, but it kind of escaped my mind for a

555
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:18,671
second there.

556
00:30:25,617 --> 00:30:29,861
Well, I think the biggest one, actually, that always works

557
00:30:29,981 --> 00:30:33,645
really well, in my opinion, for us to reach out to people is

558
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:36,568
if you can get their grandchildren to be really

559
00:30:36,588 --> 00:30:38,810
excited about something that they can do with their

560
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:39,350
grandparents.

561
00:30:40,151 --> 00:30:41,872
It is really easy to get them to play.

562
00:30:43,233 --> 00:30:46,035
And that's typically, even when we recruit people for the

563
00:30:46,155 --> 00:30:48,837
Oxford Adult Gamers Club, we will just put an announce out

564
00:30:49,297 --> 00:30:54,261
in some local magazines that we know are read by 60-plus

565
00:30:54,281 --> 00:30:54,621
year olds.

566
00:30:55,481 --> 00:30:57,583
And we'll typically say, look, you want to know what your

567
00:30:57,603 --> 00:30:59,004
grandkids are so excited about?

568
00:30:59,084 --> 00:30:59,704
We'll teach you.

569
00:31:00,104 --> 00:31:02,546
And that helps us a whole lot with getting people to come

570
00:31:02,606 --> 00:31:03,447
over and try things out.

571
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:04,547
But that's more at a local level.

572
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,829
I think at an international level.

573
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:11,171
Online communities seem to be still the best way to do it.

574
00:31:11,891 --> 00:31:13,872
And there are actually some online communities that are

575
00:31:13,912 --> 00:31:15,733
specifically tailored towards older adults

576
00:31:15,753 --> 00:31:16,793
that play video games.

577
00:31:16,813 --> 00:31:20,034
There's an Australian website called theoldergamer.com.

578
00:31:20,194 --> 00:31:21,655
I've used that for my own research a

579
00:31:21,695 --> 00:31:22,495
couple of times as well.

580
00:31:26,937 --> 00:31:27,917
All right, any more questions?

581
00:31:30,458 --> 00:31:31,839
Great, well I guess we're done here then.

582
00:31:31,879 --> 00:31:32,499
Thanks so much, guys.
