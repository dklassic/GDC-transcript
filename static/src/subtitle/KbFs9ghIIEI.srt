1
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:11,483
Today we're going to explore colorblindness in detail.

2
00:00:11,483 --> 00:00:14,205
And I'd like to take the risk.

3
00:00:14,205 --> 00:00:16,627
Could you raise your hands if yourselves are colorblind?

4
00:00:16,627 --> 00:00:16,948
There's a few.

5
00:00:16,948 --> 00:00:19,971
And for everyone else,

6
00:00:19,971 --> 00:00:23,013
if you personally know someone who is colorblind.

7
00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:28,060
That's pretty much everyone was one of the other.

8
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:29,061
Cool.

9
00:00:29,061 --> 00:00:30,982
So hopefully you can learn something to help yourselves

10
00:00:30,982 --> 00:00:33,903
and the people around you today.

11
00:00:33,903 --> 00:00:35,344
So a little introduction on who I am

12
00:00:35,344 --> 00:00:36,725
and what I'm doing up here.

13
00:00:36,725 --> 00:00:38,806
So my name is Douglas Pennant.

14
00:00:38,806 --> 00:00:42,688
I work at the Creative Assembly in the United Kingdom,

15
00:00:42,688 --> 00:00:44,949
a short path of my career.

16
00:00:44,949 --> 00:00:47,951
So I started off in the games industry in 2010

17
00:00:47,951 --> 00:00:51,012
as a QA tester at Microsoft over in England.

18
00:00:52,108 --> 00:00:55,912
And I am now an associate development manager.

19
00:00:55,912 --> 00:00:57,574
So first one with the production team

20
00:00:57,574 --> 00:01:00,658
at the Creative Assembly on their console team

21
00:01:00,658 --> 00:01:01,919
working on our unannounced IP.

22
00:01:01,919 --> 00:01:05,023
And I am colorblind.

23
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:07,506
I have severe deuteranopia.

24
00:01:07,506 --> 00:01:10,089
Like, I think it is severe,

25
00:01:10,089 --> 00:01:12,572
and this shows up in the fact that I talk about it so much.

26
00:01:13,128 --> 00:01:14,388
because a lot of people are quite quiet

27
00:01:14,388 --> 00:01:15,268
about their colorblindness.

28
00:01:15,268 --> 00:01:17,089
They don't think there's,

29
00:01:17,089 --> 00:01:19,629
they don't realize how much it's affecting their lives.

30
00:01:19,629 --> 00:01:21,509
It's not a very well understood condition,

31
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:24,510
even though the name is so widely spoken.

32
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,230
So what I'm going to cover today.

33
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:28,771
So I'm gonna talk about exactly what colorblindness is,

34
00:01:28,771 --> 00:01:30,791
and there are gonna be lots and lots of pictures.

35
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:32,691
Take as many photos as you like.

36
00:01:32,691 --> 00:01:36,112
And so we'll try to understand the condition some more.

37
00:01:36,112 --> 00:01:38,933
Then we'll cover, this is a games conference,

38
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:40,373
and we want to know what does colorblindness do

39
00:01:40,373 --> 00:01:41,313
to the games we make?

40
00:01:41,313 --> 00:01:42,913
How does it affect the player experience?

41
00:01:44,153 --> 00:01:47,675
And then I'm going to drill down into some of the issues

42
00:01:47,675 --> 00:01:51,177
with Halo Wars 2, that was the last project

43
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:54,058
that my team released, and some of the color issues

44
00:01:54,058 --> 00:01:54,719
that this had.

45
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:59,781
And also going into details of why it's,

46
00:01:59,781 --> 00:02:01,602
even if we understand the condition,

47
00:02:01,602 --> 00:02:04,063
what are some of the roadblocks to actually developing

48
00:02:04,063 --> 00:02:04,763
for color blindness?

49
00:02:06,003 --> 00:02:08,864
And then, of course, as many solutions as I can give you.

50
00:02:08,864 --> 00:02:10,105
Places where they've been used well,

51
00:02:10,105 --> 00:02:12,325
somewhere they've been used partially well,

52
00:02:12,325 --> 00:02:15,246
and some guidelines you can take to apply to your own games.

53
00:02:15,246 --> 00:02:17,707
So, straight to the condition.

54
00:02:17,707 --> 00:02:20,148
So what exactly is color blindness?

55
00:02:20,148 --> 00:02:22,849
The simplest definition I could find

56
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:25,270
is the inability or decreased ability

57
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,370
to distinguish certain colors.

58
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:29,691
This doesn't simply mean seeing in black and white.

59
00:02:30,975 --> 00:02:33,837
So, but before the disability,

60
00:02:33,837 --> 00:02:35,699
how do we see color normally?

61
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:39,521
So, in our eyes, we have two types of photoreceptor cells.

62
00:02:39,521 --> 00:02:42,283
We have rods and we have cones.

63
00:02:42,283 --> 00:02:44,525
The rods detect low-level light.

64
00:02:44,525 --> 00:02:46,947
So this is your night vision,

65
00:02:46,947 --> 00:02:50,369
like which you don't have very good color

66
00:02:50,369 --> 00:02:51,190
in your night vision.

67
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,251
The rods just pick up basically, I don't know,

68
00:02:53,251 --> 00:02:54,292
black and white.

69
00:02:54,292 --> 00:02:57,014
And so low-level light to kind of help you survive.

70
00:02:57,512 --> 00:03:00,094
And they talk about many animals being colorblind.

71
00:03:00,094 --> 00:03:01,816
They have rods.

72
00:03:01,816 --> 00:03:03,717
They are effective at low-level vision.

73
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:05,139
They don't need the color.

74
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:09,002
Yeah, as I said.

75
00:03:09,002 --> 00:03:11,824
Cones are where we get all our color from.

76
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:14,246
So they detect intense light.

77
00:03:14,246 --> 00:03:16,588
And we have three types of them.

78
00:03:16,588 --> 00:03:19,550
We have our red cones, our blue cones, and our green cones.

79
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,932
And all the colors we see are combinations

80
00:03:21,932 --> 00:03:24,435
of these three hues in one way or another.

81
00:03:25,316 --> 00:03:29,341
And if you're lucky enough to have normal color vision,

82
00:03:29,341 --> 00:03:33,766
this is known as trichromacy, so three chromatic.

83
00:03:33,766 --> 00:03:36,609
So there are multiple types of color blindness as well.

84
00:03:36,609 --> 00:03:40,574
So more than just even the three.

85
00:03:40,574 --> 00:03:43,958
So we have deuteranomaly, protanomaly, tritanomaly.

86
00:03:44,969 --> 00:03:46,310
These are known as anomalous trichromacy.

87
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:51,593
This is where there is a defect with the cones in your eyes,

88
00:03:51,593 --> 00:03:53,274
one of the types of cones.

89
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:54,955
But you still have those cells.

90
00:03:54,955 --> 00:03:58,997
Then there is deuteranopia, which I suffer from,

91
00:03:58,997 --> 00:04:00,518
protanopia, and tritanopia.

92
00:04:00,518 --> 00:04:03,339
These are dichromacy.

93
00:04:03,339 --> 00:04:06,621
One of the types of cones is basically missing.

94
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:12,394
And the different names are depending on which cone is missing.

95
00:04:12,394 --> 00:04:16,857
So deuteranopia is, well, I'll go into some more detail shortly.

96
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:20,460
I mentioned that this doesn't mean we see in black and white.

97
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,202
But there are some people that do.

98
00:04:23,202 --> 00:04:24,683
This is a very rare condition.

99
00:04:24,683 --> 00:04:26,685
It is called achromatopsia.

100
00:04:26,685 --> 00:04:28,866
And it is, of course, monochromatic.

101
00:04:28,866 --> 00:04:31,168
And this only affects roughly one in 30,000 people.

102
00:04:32,363 --> 00:04:33,844
except in one place in the world.

103
00:04:33,844 --> 00:04:36,066
There is an island in Pingelap,

104
00:04:36,066 --> 00:04:38,367
it's in Micronesia in the Pacific,

105
00:04:38,367 --> 00:04:43,431
and around 25% of their population have achromatopsia.

106
00:04:43,431 --> 00:04:46,633
This was because of a natural disaster

107
00:04:46,633 --> 00:04:47,914
that wiped out most of the island,

108
00:04:47,914 --> 00:04:53,958
and in repopulating, one of the survivors had achromatopsia,

109
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:56,539
and then this was passed down

110
00:04:56,539 --> 00:04:59,902
to a large part of the population through the genetics.

111
00:05:02,185 --> 00:05:05,466
I'm going to focus on these three,

112
00:05:05,466 --> 00:05:06,827
because supporting deuteranopia,

113
00:05:06,827 --> 00:05:11,089
protanopia, and tritanopia accommodates

114
00:05:11,089 --> 00:05:14,051
for the anomalous trichromacies above,

115
00:05:14,051 --> 00:05:17,012
because these are the most extreme versions of them.

116
00:05:17,012 --> 00:05:18,633
So, first off, deuteranopia,

117
00:05:18,633 --> 00:05:20,774
which is, of those of you that raised your hands

118
00:05:20,774 --> 00:05:23,776
and said you were colorblind, this is probably you.

119
00:05:23,776 --> 00:05:26,237
This is the most common type of red-green colorblindness.

120
00:05:26,237 --> 00:05:30,379
In effect, of all colorblind men,

121
00:05:30,379 --> 00:05:31,499
this is around 75% of them.

122
00:05:32,475 --> 00:05:34,936
And I say males quite specifically,

123
00:05:34,936 --> 00:05:36,217
and I'll explain why shortly.

124
00:05:36,217 --> 00:05:39,658
So this is a reduced sensitivity to green light.

125
00:05:39,658 --> 00:05:42,299
I know it can be known as green blindness.

126
00:05:42,299 --> 00:05:46,521
And what you can often expect if you have this condition

127
00:05:46,521 --> 00:05:49,102
is reds, greens, and browns will be confused,

128
00:05:49,102 --> 00:05:52,744
blue greens and grays, light greens and yellows.

129
00:05:52,744 --> 00:05:54,884
I didn't know lime green existed until I read it

130
00:05:54,884 --> 00:05:57,105
on the back of my Game Boy Color as a child.

131
00:05:57,105 --> 00:05:59,526
And they nicely embossed it.

132
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,427
I'd thought for about two years it was yellow.

133
00:06:02,854 --> 00:06:06,977
And reds, oranges, and yellows, of course.

134
00:06:06,977 --> 00:06:09,940
And yes, and even some blues, purples, and dark pinks.

135
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,082
So I don't see pink much, it tends to be white.

136
00:06:12,082 --> 00:06:14,984
Then there is protanopia.

137
00:06:14,984 --> 00:06:17,787
This is another kind of red-green colorblindness.

138
00:06:17,787 --> 00:06:18,367
So we have the two.

139
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:21,230
But it's far less common.

140
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:25,473
So this is around a quarter of colorblind men, roughly.

141
00:06:25,473 --> 00:06:28,236
So this is all about red light, reduced sensitivity.

142
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:32,430
And so these people confuse black with red.

143
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:35,333
So the intensity of red is greatly diminished.

144
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,034
And the difference here can be,

145
00:06:37,034 --> 00:06:40,036
it's like the difference between a light being on or off.

146
00:06:40,036 --> 00:06:43,299
And so black, like for the purposes of color blindness,

147
00:06:43,299 --> 00:06:44,580
we have to consider black a color.

148
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:48,963
Browns, greens, reds, and oranges often get blurred as well.

149
00:06:48,963 --> 00:06:51,785
Quite a lot of crossover with deuteranopia.

150
00:06:51,785 --> 00:06:53,026
Blues, purples, and dark pinks.

151
00:06:53,026 --> 00:06:56,308
And many reds and oranges, of course, very dim.

152
00:06:57,823 --> 00:07:01,525
And the third one, much rarer, is tritanopia.

153
00:07:01,525 --> 00:07:04,786
So this is very rare indeed.

154
00:07:04,786 --> 00:07:07,088
This is only around one in 10,000 people,

155
00:07:07,088 --> 00:07:11,830
although I have met one tritanope on this trip so far.

156
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,671
They were with us on the train jam.

157
00:07:13,671 --> 00:07:18,533
And this affects men and women equally,

158
00:07:18,533 --> 00:07:21,775
because this is affected by a different chromosome

159
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:24,016
to the other types of colorblindness.

160
00:07:24,016 --> 00:07:25,737
This is on chromosome seven,

161
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:26,858
and this is not.

162
00:07:27,962 --> 00:07:29,422
rather than the X and Y.

163
00:07:29,422 --> 00:07:30,903
And this is equal between men and women.

164
00:07:30,903 --> 00:07:35,265
And this focuses on a reduced sensitivity

165
00:07:35,265 --> 00:07:37,265
to blue and yellow light.

166
00:07:37,265 --> 00:07:40,046
And so it's not often heard, there aren't many people,

167
00:07:40,046 --> 00:07:41,807
they don't speak up about the issue,

168
00:07:41,807 --> 00:07:43,928
and so people don't expect these problems.

169
00:07:43,928 --> 00:07:46,809
So blue greens and grays are a problem,

170
00:07:46,809 --> 00:07:48,510
dark purples, they can become black,

171
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,591
and oranges with reds.

172
00:07:50,591 --> 00:07:54,512
So where does this come from?

173
00:07:54,512 --> 00:07:56,513
So a little biology lesson.

174
00:07:57,682 --> 00:08:00,504
Men have an X chromosome and a Y chromosome,

175
00:08:00,504 --> 00:08:02,305
women have two X chromosomes.

176
00:08:02,305 --> 00:08:06,668
The advantage of this is that if there is a defect

177
00:08:06,668 --> 00:08:09,450
on an X chromosome for a woman,

178
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:10,891
if the chromosome is fine on the other one,

179
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:12,412
she does not suffer from the condition.

180
00:08:12,412 --> 00:08:16,915
There are many conditions that are more prevalent in men

181
00:08:16,915 --> 00:08:19,417
for this very reason, because if I have a problem

182
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:22,279
on my X chromosome, and I do,

183
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:24,281
my Y chromosome can't compensate.

184
00:08:24,281 --> 00:08:27,023
It doesn't have the reflective.

185
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:29,259
chromosomes to back it up.

186
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,800
And so colorblindness is mostly hereditary.

187
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,523
Deuteranopia and protanopia are a defect on the X chromosome.

188
00:08:36,523 --> 00:08:39,045
And so this is passed down,

189
00:08:39,045 --> 00:08:41,526
and this will be passed down to men.

190
00:08:41,526 --> 00:08:44,728
And it has to come from their mother, in this case,

191
00:08:44,728 --> 00:08:47,450
because a man passes a Y chromosome to their son.

192
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:51,172
A woman can be a carrier,

193
00:08:51,172 --> 00:08:53,974
and it's then basically a 50-50 chance

194
00:08:53,974 --> 00:08:56,035
does she pass the defective X chromosome to her son.

195
00:08:56,657 --> 00:09:00,721
For a woman to be colorblind of one of these two,

196
00:09:00,721 --> 00:09:02,643
her father must be colorblind

197
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:05,966
because that X chromosome must come down,

198
00:09:05,966 --> 00:09:08,068
and then it's a 50-50 from her mother.

199
00:09:08,068 --> 00:09:10,611
If her mother is colorblind and her father is colorblind,

200
00:09:10,611 --> 00:09:11,152
she's getting it.

201
00:09:11,152 --> 00:09:11,412
I am sorry.

202
00:09:11,412 --> 00:09:14,555
Tritonopure, of course, is different.

203
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:17,618
This is defective chromosome seven.

204
00:09:17,618 --> 00:09:19,540
This is not a sexual chromosome.

205
00:09:21,058 --> 00:09:24,459
But also, this one can be triggered by other issues in the brain.

206
00:09:24,459 --> 00:09:26,760
So there can be illnesses and injuries,

207
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:31,082
and some medications can cause tritanopia-like symptoms.

208
00:09:31,082 --> 00:09:32,102
And also age.

209
00:09:32,102 --> 00:09:36,043
So, as you grow older, your eyes change quite a lot.

210
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:39,065
As many people know, you're likely to get more long-sighted,

211
00:09:39,065 --> 00:09:40,245
likely to need glasses,

212
00:09:40,245 --> 00:09:44,367
but you're also likely to lose your sensitivity to blue and yellow light.

213
00:09:45,932 --> 00:09:49,154
And so, in a way, designing for colorblindness

214
00:09:49,154 --> 00:09:51,956
is designing for you, just not yet.

215
00:09:51,956 --> 00:09:55,319
So, it's different around the world as well.

216
00:09:55,319 --> 00:09:59,663
So, across the world, around one in 12 men are colorblind,

217
00:09:59,663 --> 00:10:02,585
around 8% of men across the earth.

218
00:10:02,585 --> 00:10:04,347
Only one in 200 women, I think.

219
00:10:05,007 --> 00:10:08,109
But when you scale up the numbers to a,

220
00:10:08,109 --> 00:10:11,712
so if you have a million players

221
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:14,074
with a roughly 50-50 gender split,

222
00:10:14,074 --> 00:10:18,397
you would statistically expect colorblindness

223
00:10:18,397 --> 00:10:20,279
in over 40,000 of your male players

224
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:22,040
and about 2,500 of your female players.

225
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,542
That is if you have a million.

226
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:29,086
Last I checked, Fortnite has, as of November,

227
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,127
125 million players.

228
00:10:30,127 --> 00:10:31,908
So there's a lot of players

229
00:10:31,908 --> 00:10:34,270
that can benefit from these features.

230
00:10:35,581 --> 00:10:38,664
This also changes depending on geography.

231
00:10:38,664 --> 00:10:40,326
So in Caucasian populations, this is genetic.

232
00:10:40,326 --> 00:10:42,829
It stays in the family.

233
00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:43,790
And it's much more common.

234
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:46,333
So in Scandinavian men, it's around 10% to 11%.

235
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:49,776
Whereas in Asian men, it's only around 5%.

236
00:10:49,776 --> 00:10:52,499
And in Africa, it's only around 4%.

237
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:57,148
So, that's where it is, that's how it's caused.

238
00:10:57,148 --> 00:10:59,289
What happens when you're colorblind?

239
00:10:59,289 --> 00:11:04,271
And in short, life is a bit weird.

240
00:11:04,271 --> 00:11:07,353
So there are lots of things that I just can't see

241
00:11:07,353 --> 00:11:08,593
and can't do very well.

242
00:11:08,593 --> 00:11:11,154
So when I'm cooking meat,

243
00:11:11,154 --> 00:11:13,936
I generally overcook it just to be safe

244
00:11:13,936 --> 00:11:17,477
because I can't see when it is browned properly.

245
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:19,658
Like raw meat and cooked meat so often look the same.

246
00:11:19,658 --> 00:11:21,919
I've been called out for eating chicken.

247
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:22,700
No, that's not cooked yet.

248
00:11:23,698 --> 00:11:27,741
and it's a little worrying.

249
00:11:27,741 --> 00:11:28,862
Any LEDs, any lights on anything,

250
00:11:28,862 --> 00:11:31,345
like on microphones, on routers,

251
00:11:31,345 --> 00:11:34,568
or like any other devices you have at home,

252
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:37,530
the lights, because they're so bright,

253
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,592
they just all start to look the same,

254
00:11:39,592 --> 00:11:41,954
along with red, green, yellow, orange.

255
00:11:41,954 --> 00:11:42,935
It's just all of the same.

256
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:47,719
And fun fact is there's a screenshot from my phone

257
00:11:47,719 --> 00:11:49,140
that for ages I was

258
00:11:50,573 --> 00:11:52,955
When I first got the new phone, I would get a call

259
00:11:52,955 --> 00:11:56,037
and I would try to answer it and then the call would drop.

260
00:11:56,037 --> 00:11:56,657
And I didn't know why.

261
00:11:56,657 --> 00:11:57,878
It was getting really annoying.

262
00:11:57,878 --> 00:11:59,859
And then after a while I realized,

263
00:11:59,859 --> 00:12:02,501
I'm pressing the wrong damn button.

264
00:12:02,501 --> 00:12:05,583
Because even though I,

265
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,564
like even though there are two other parts

266
00:12:07,564 --> 00:12:09,326
of the language there,

267
00:12:09,326 --> 00:12:12,107
like the affirmative button is on the left as usual.

268
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:15,910
And it looks like the receiver is picking it up.

269
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,491
And in the stress of the moment,

270
00:12:17,491 --> 00:12:19,252
even I, knowing I'm colorblind,

271
00:12:19,252 --> 00:12:20,073
I still go for the color.

272
00:12:20,682 --> 00:12:22,802
And I went for the button I thought was green,

273
00:12:22,802 --> 00:12:24,582
which was the wrong one.

274
00:12:24,582 --> 00:12:26,423
So I was hanging up loads and loads of calls

275
00:12:26,423 --> 00:12:27,743
and I didn't know why.

276
00:12:27,743 --> 00:12:31,684
Fashion is a bit of a write-off.

277
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:33,924
I quite like that while I like,

278
00:12:33,924 --> 00:12:35,805
one step is that there are labels in clothing

279
00:12:35,805 --> 00:12:37,245
to say which colors they are.

280
00:12:37,245 --> 00:12:39,465
That doesn't mean I know which colors go with what.

281
00:12:39,465 --> 00:12:43,846
So I, and if I do want to try and dress fashionably,

282
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:47,007
I genuinely need help.

283
00:12:47,007 --> 00:12:48,287
But, or I just wear gray all the time.

284
00:12:49,599 --> 00:12:51,920
Apparently that's something called, is that burgundy?

285
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,880
A mythical creature called burgundy.

286
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,821
I'll take your word for it.

287
00:12:56,821 --> 00:13:00,902
And same goes for, like, there are lots of people

288
00:13:00,902 --> 00:13:03,522
around GDC with different colored hair,

289
00:13:03,522 --> 00:13:05,883
and I have no idea what it is.

290
00:13:05,883 --> 00:13:08,663
Like, and I see a lot of what may or may not be

291
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:11,424
blue, purple, or turquoise hair, or pink.

292
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:14,464
Like, I, and it's like Schrodinger's hair color.

293
00:13:14,464 --> 00:13:16,005
It's one of those, I don't know which one.

294
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:21,633
And if this is embarrassing to anyone, I don't know that either.

295
00:13:21,633 --> 00:13:27,676
Only a few years ago I realized that blushing is real.

296
00:13:27,676 --> 00:13:29,938
I thought it was a cartoon thing.

297
00:13:29,938 --> 00:13:33,220
And it was only a few years ago I realized, wait, it's real,

298
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,722
but the colorblindness stops me from seeing it.

299
00:13:35,722 --> 00:13:39,404
And it's really annoying, this social cue that for all this time

300
00:13:39,404 --> 00:13:41,845
I could have been using and understanding people.

301
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,715
This one came up last year, actually.

302
00:13:46,715 --> 00:13:49,736
This one affected a lot of people.

303
00:13:49,736 --> 00:13:54,137
So the uniforms in the, this is of course soccer,

304
00:13:54,137 --> 00:13:56,118
like I'm used to calling it football.

305
00:13:56,118 --> 00:13:58,598
Everything was going wrong here.

306
00:13:58,598 --> 00:14:01,379
So the two players were being indistinguishable

307
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:03,299
from each other with the colorblindness.

308
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:06,380
And also some of the players, they looked like the pitch.

309
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,881
Like they blend into the green of the grass.

310
00:14:09,576 --> 00:14:12,077
So it's not just distinguishing element A from element B,

311
00:14:12,077 --> 00:14:14,918
but it's both elements from the environment.

312
00:14:14,918 --> 00:14:17,180
This is actually very translatable to games.

313
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:20,381
There's something else that I've never seen.

314
00:14:20,381 --> 00:14:22,962
I've never seen that.

315
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:25,143
That's not what I'd identify as.

316
00:14:25,143 --> 00:14:29,445
Like, in my eyes, that's not what my skin color looks like.

317
00:14:29,445 --> 00:14:31,986
I look like this.

318
00:14:31,986 --> 00:14:33,087
And so do all of you, by the way.

319
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:37,994
Like, I know other people have looked at the simulators I see

320
00:14:37,994 --> 00:14:40,555
and like to see my colorblindness, and they're like,

321
00:14:40,555 --> 00:14:41,376
oh, everybody's green.

322
00:14:41,376 --> 00:14:43,497
And I was like, okay, yeah.

323
00:14:43,497 --> 00:14:44,337
When I was in primary school,

324
00:14:44,337 --> 00:14:46,158
I thought my friends had green skin.

325
00:14:46,158 --> 00:14:48,840
Because normally you don't have to tell children

326
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,781
nobody's green.

327
00:14:50,781 --> 00:14:53,262
I was just going by what I could see.

328
00:14:53,262 --> 00:14:59,005
And to accommodate for the other types of colorblindness,

329
00:14:59,005 --> 00:14:59,625
this is how they identify.

330
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:02,247
So this is how protonopes see themselves,

331
00:15:02,247 --> 00:15:03,287
how tritonopes see themselves.

332
00:15:04,045 --> 00:15:08,867
Medical emergencies are often missing a lot of information.

333
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:10,988
I've had someone fainting in front of me before,

334
00:15:10,988 --> 00:15:12,588
and his skin white as a sheet,

335
00:15:12,588 --> 00:15:13,989
and I had no idea there was anything wrong with him.

336
00:15:13,989 --> 00:15:18,170
Until one of the ladies from Brown came in,

337
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:21,811
I was like, oh my God, I'm getting the nurse.

338
00:15:21,811 --> 00:15:23,051
But he was fine. He was fine in the end.

339
00:15:23,982 --> 00:15:29,206
So, a lot of people have some ideas and assumptions about colorblindness and what it can and cannot

340
00:15:29,206 --> 00:15:30,106
let you do.

341
00:15:30,106 --> 00:15:31,968
So, the question, can you drive?

342
00:15:31,968 --> 00:15:35,890
And the answer is, so can you distinguish traffic lights?

343
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:37,832
And the answer is generally yes.

344
00:15:37,832 --> 00:15:41,254
The traffic light systems are generally pretty well thought out.

345
00:15:41,254 --> 00:15:46,278
At night, red and yellow lights, or red and amber lights will often look the same, but

346
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:49,640
because of the pattern and the timing of them, it doesn't matter.

347
00:15:50,303 --> 00:15:53,986
So, for me, if I can see the green light, that means go.

348
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:56,869
If I can see the flashing yellow light, at least in the UK,

349
00:15:56,869 --> 00:15:57,429
that means go.

350
00:15:57,429 --> 00:15:59,831
Everything else means stop.

351
00:15:59,831 --> 00:16:01,453
And so it's absolutely fine.

352
00:16:01,453 --> 00:16:04,315
So, we're good.

353
00:16:04,315 --> 00:16:05,977
Now, this one, a lot of people bring up,

354
00:16:05,977 --> 00:16:08,879
and this was popularized by the film Little Miss Sunshine.

355
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:11,742
One of the characters, colorblind, wanted to be a pilot.

356
00:16:11,742 --> 00:16:14,324
And was told, you can't be a pilot if you're colorblind.

357
00:16:14,324 --> 00:16:15,425
But is that true?

358
00:16:15,425 --> 00:16:16,846
And the answer is, it's maybe.

359
00:16:18,635 --> 00:16:22,376
It's like, it depends on the strength of your colorblindness

360
00:16:22,376 --> 00:16:24,657
and how intense it is.

361
00:16:24,657 --> 00:16:25,737
So you would be, you can expect to be tested

362
00:16:25,737 --> 00:16:30,098
as an individual against the symbols and stuff they have.

363
00:16:30,098 --> 00:16:32,338
So if you can practically handle their stuff,

364
00:16:32,338 --> 00:16:35,259
even colorblind people can fly planes.

365
00:16:35,259 --> 00:16:37,159
Now this is my favorite slide.

366
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:41,220
Does everyone recognize this?

367
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,841
Yeah, okay, we're doing this.

368
00:16:42,841 --> 00:16:46,722
Okay, raise your hands if you see a black and blue dress.

369
00:16:48,548 --> 00:16:49,328
I'll have a look around.

370
00:16:49,328 --> 00:16:51,449
Okay, hands down.

371
00:16:51,449 --> 00:16:54,011
And those that see white and gold.

372
00:16:54,011 --> 00:16:57,633
That is about 50-50, that's amazing.

373
00:16:57,633 --> 00:17:00,074
I love it.

374
00:17:00,074 --> 00:17:01,935
I see that, it's not that different.

375
00:17:01,935 --> 00:17:08,038
But when this happened, this was the best week of my life.

376
00:17:08,038 --> 00:17:11,320
Because it was like the world went colorblind

377
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,701
for about a week and had no idea how to handle it.

378
00:17:14,497 --> 00:17:18,458
Because I don't remember not knowing I was colorblind.

379
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:21,539
I found out very early in life.

380
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:25,520
The question, why have you drawn the sea purple, Doug?

381
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,860
I haven't, it's blue.

382
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:30,021
It leads to a diagnosis fairly quickly.

383
00:17:30,021 --> 00:17:33,622
But what this also means is,

384
00:17:33,622 --> 00:17:38,003
knowing that I've been colorblind the whole time

385
00:17:38,003 --> 00:17:39,804
is knowledge that what I'm seeing might not be real,

386
00:17:39,804 --> 00:17:40,324
might not be right.

387
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,100
And I'm used to that.

388
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,181
I'm used to being told,

389
00:17:43,181 --> 00:17:45,422
actually, no, that's not what this is,

390
00:17:45,422 --> 00:17:47,683
this thing that's right in front of your eyes.

391
00:17:47,683 --> 00:17:51,025
But people with normal vision, normal color vision,

392
00:17:51,025 --> 00:17:52,706
they're not used to that.

393
00:17:52,706 --> 00:17:55,067
I had a really curious experience.

394
00:17:55,067 --> 00:17:57,368
I was helping out at some medical students' exams

395
00:17:57,368 --> 00:17:57,989
as a dummy patient,

396
00:17:57,989 --> 00:18:00,910
and one of the things they had to do

397
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:02,111
was giving a colorblind test.

398
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,692
So they said, oh, get Doug in.

399
00:18:03,692 --> 00:18:04,532
He's actually colorblind.

400
00:18:05,246 --> 00:18:08,428
And so the student comes, they have around seven minutes

401
00:18:08,428 --> 00:18:10,389
to run the Ishihara plate test,

402
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:12,750
which is the dots and the circles that you see quite often.

403
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:17,553
And then they have about seven minutes to do that

404
00:18:17,553 --> 00:18:19,254
and then they'll move on to something else.

405
00:18:19,254 --> 00:18:21,375
One of the students finished quite quickly.

406
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,796
So went through the diagnosis, it was fine.

407
00:18:23,796 --> 00:18:25,517
And I was sat there with him and the examiner.

408
00:18:26,228 --> 00:18:27,790
And I had time, I asked,

409
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:30,713
do you guys see anything in this plate?

410
00:18:30,713 --> 00:18:33,716
So it was one of the plates that I knew where,

411
00:18:33,716 --> 00:18:35,838
because of my color blindness, I could see the number.

412
00:18:35,838 --> 00:18:36,639
It was very cleverly made.

413
00:18:36,639 --> 00:18:39,082
But the language was interesting in the response.

414
00:18:39,082 --> 00:18:42,145
They didn't say, I can't see a number.

415
00:18:42,145 --> 00:18:43,947
They said, there is no number there.

416
00:18:43,947 --> 00:18:45,889
And I said, well, I can see a number.

417
00:18:45,889 --> 00:18:47,691
And they said, no, there is no number there.

418
00:18:48,963 --> 00:18:50,724
and they're not used to this.

419
00:18:50,724 --> 00:18:52,946
Like, they're not used to the idea that,

420
00:18:52,946 --> 00:18:54,167
and they're used to, like, if they can see it,

421
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:56,889
it's there, and that's all there is.

422
00:18:56,889 --> 00:18:57,830
It was really interesting.

423
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,592
It's like a little philosophical, you know,

424
00:18:59,592 --> 00:19:00,292
step up for me, so.

425
00:19:00,292 --> 00:19:03,755
Right, okay, let's talk about video games.

426
00:19:03,755 --> 00:19:06,377
So, this is going to cover a few

427
00:19:06,377 --> 00:19:09,380
of the common issues in video games,

428
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,061
not all of them, right,

429
00:19:11,061 --> 00:19:13,283
because we make games new every time,

430
00:19:13,283 --> 00:19:14,864
and so we reinvent our problems every time.

431
00:19:14,864 --> 00:19:14,904
So,

432
00:19:16,546 --> 00:19:21,108
But what we can expect is team colors are very common issues.

433
00:19:21,108 --> 00:19:23,070
Blending UI and characters and environment,

434
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:25,351
like in the soccer game, this is common as an issue.

435
00:19:25,351 --> 00:19:29,593
Puzzles, color matching puzzles, clearly.

436
00:19:29,593 --> 00:19:32,635
And lots and lots and lots of UI information.

437
00:19:32,635 --> 00:19:34,076
I know we like color.

438
00:19:34,076 --> 00:19:34,836
It's so fast.

439
00:19:34,836 --> 00:19:35,696
It feels so intuitive.

440
00:19:36,644 --> 00:19:38,666
but it's exactly where I lose the problem.

441
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:43,649
So, so first example, this is Battlefield 3.

442
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:45,971
We're going back a few years now.

443
00:19:45,971 --> 00:19:48,873
So I was a huge fan of Battlefield 2 and 2142,

444
00:19:48,873 --> 00:19:51,756
and I never had any problems.

445
00:19:51,756 --> 00:19:54,878
Their color differences at the time, blue was friendly,

446
00:19:54,878 --> 00:19:57,640
yellow was squad mate, red was enemy.

447
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,161
I just needed to shoot the red guys.

448
00:19:59,161 --> 00:20:00,082
That's fine.

449
00:20:01,096 --> 00:20:04,879
But this, but they changed it in Battlefield 3.

450
00:20:04,879 --> 00:20:07,840
So squad mates were, I think, you know,

451
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,821
I don't actually know.

452
00:20:08,821 --> 00:20:11,583
Squad mates were green and the enemies were yellow?

453
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:12,684
Or was it the other way around?

454
00:20:12,684 --> 00:20:13,965
Or was one of them orange?

455
00:20:13,965 --> 00:20:14,385
I don't know.

456
00:20:14,385 --> 00:20:16,366
For me, they were basically the same.

457
00:20:16,366 --> 00:20:17,267
So I bought this game,

458
00:20:17,267 --> 00:20:19,388
and there were no colorblind modes.

459
00:20:19,388 --> 00:20:19,869
There was nothing.

460
00:20:19,869 --> 00:20:22,230
And so, and I couldn't play it.

461
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:25,452
Like, I could try and contextually figure out,

462
00:20:25,452 --> 00:20:27,213
like, I know, right, I know someone went up there.

463
00:20:27,213 --> 00:20:28,074
Is that one of the guys?

464
00:20:28,074 --> 00:20:28,915
Is he on my mini-map?

465
00:20:29,898 --> 00:20:31,119
but I've already been shot.

466
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:33,119
Like, these kids know how to shoot.

467
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:37,120
But yeah, and that was kind of heartbreaking for me

468
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,981
because I really loved the Battlefield series up to then.

469
00:20:40,981 --> 00:20:42,041
And then it was just roadblock.

470
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,781
I couldn't go any further.

471
00:20:43,781 --> 00:20:45,522
Another shooter, Overwatch.

472
00:20:45,522 --> 00:20:47,982
So this one, Overwatch is incredibly busy,

473
00:20:47,982 --> 00:20:50,923
incredibly complicated, and you can choose your own skins,

474
00:20:50,923 --> 00:20:52,643
like, which are all different colors,

475
00:20:52,643 --> 00:20:54,123
and it creates a very complex.

476
00:20:55,251 --> 00:20:57,852
colored landscape, and it all just starts to blend together.

477
00:20:57,852 --> 00:21:00,654
So like those of you that can recognize Reaper,

478
00:21:00,654 --> 00:21:02,354
I know there on the left in the black cloak,

479
00:21:02,354 --> 00:21:04,996
I can't tell his team color

480
00:21:04,996 --> 00:21:08,858
because the red hue over it just kind of blends.

481
00:21:08,858 --> 00:21:12,599
I know it's not as intense as it needs to be.

482
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:15,621
And then even the UI above them

483
00:21:15,621 --> 00:21:17,302
kind of blends into different parts of the environment.

484
00:21:17,302 --> 00:21:18,142
It's not clear.

485
00:21:19,369 --> 00:21:21,070
And similarly, puzzles.

486
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:26,273
So, straightforward enough, color matching is difficult.

487
00:21:26,273 --> 00:21:31,677
Like, that one in the bottom right is where I just see those colors and I just give up.

488
00:21:31,677 --> 00:21:36,020
Like, I can see too many colors that I know for a fact I get wrong all the time.

489
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,382
And there is no way for me to get them right.

490
00:21:40,469 --> 00:21:42,110
UI information.

491
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:44,830
So, using depth of hue and deepness of hue

492
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:47,131
is so common and it feels so good

493
00:21:47,131 --> 00:21:50,131
because it's a piece of information

494
00:21:50,131 --> 00:21:51,812
that if you're trichromatic, you feel it.

495
00:21:51,812 --> 00:21:55,473
I understand why it's great.

496
00:21:55,473 --> 00:21:57,073
But I can't.

497
00:21:57,073 --> 00:21:59,053
I can't see it.

498
00:21:59,053 --> 00:22:02,014
The greens, so this is from MechWarrior,

499
00:22:02,014 --> 00:22:05,555
and the green parts are the healthiest parts,

500
00:22:05,555 --> 00:22:06,795
then yellow is in the middle,

501
00:22:06,795 --> 00:22:09,216
and then red is your mech is breaking down.

502
00:22:09,937 --> 00:22:13,338
and the healthiest look like the unhealthiest.

503
00:22:13,338 --> 00:22:17,759
And it takes away my ability to make decisions in the game.

504
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:19,700
This was a puzzle from Fable 3.

505
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:23,741
I think this was making the pies.

506
00:22:23,741 --> 00:22:27,722
And I had to match colors and I couldn't really tell.

507
00:22:27,722 --> 00:22:28,962
And someone was saying,

508
00:22:28,962 --> 00:22:30,383
well, they're just the same colors

509
00:22:30,383 --> 00:22:31,243
as on the Xbox controllers.

510
00:22:31,243 --> 00:22:32,203
Are they?

511
00:22:33,198 --> 00:22:35,738
I'll take your word for it, but it still doesn't help me.

512
00:22:35,738 --> 00:22:38,879
Even then, in Final Fantasy VII,

513
00:22:38,879 --> 00:22:40,599
I never considered that, like,

514
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:41,780
for me it was just a bunch of colors.

515
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,480
I never considered that the material,

516
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,701
there might be information in these colors.

517
00:22:46,701 --> 00:22:48,241
It's just so scattered for me.

518
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:50,842
So I didn't even know there was information really there.

519
00:22:50,842 --> 00:22:51,162
Right.

520
00:22:51,162 --> 00:22:55,202
So let's go to a game I worked on myself.

521
00:22:55,202 --> 00:22:58,023
So, developing Halo Wars 2 with color blindness.

522
00:22:58,023 --> 00:23:02,644
And this bit isn't really a success story, not for me.

523
00:23:03,983 --> 00:23:08,486
So I'll be covering some of the similar categories.

524
00:23:08,486 --> 00:23:13,590
So we have team colors, we have minimap and UI,

525
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:16,933
we had decisions for campaign colors,

526
00:23:16,933 --> 00:23:20,555
and we had our BlitzCard mode and some of the UI in that

527
00:23:20,555 --> 00:23:21,156
as well.

528
00:23:21,156 --> 00:23:24,498
So let's talk about team colors.

529
00:23:24,498 --> 00:23:30,743
So we had two teams with three players on each.

530
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:33,731
and they wanted to communicate this with color.

531
00:23:33,731 --> 00:23:35,552
So they wanted to somehow find hues that felt like

532
00:23:35,552 --> 00:23:37,334
you would know which team you were on

533
00:23:37,334 --> 00:23:39,876
and you would know which units were yours.

534
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:41,217
And I didn't.

535
00:23:41,217 --> 00:23:41,577
So the,

536
00:23:41,577 --> 00:23:46,100
this is hard to talk about,

537
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:50,864
the orange, yellow, and red, I think, tanks,

538
00:23:50,864 --> 00:23:53,586
all just kind of look the same on the battlefield.

539
00:23:53,586 --> 00:23:56,528
And then the tank in the middle for me,

540
00:23:56,528 --> 00:23:58,810
it looks more like part of their team

541
00:23:58,810 --> 00:23:59,771
than it does the other.

542
00:24:01,295 --> 00:24:04,718
what blues or purples, the tank at the top and the bottom.

543
00:24:04,718 --> 00:24:06,300
You can see, I think.

544
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:09,764
And so I could sometimes just about tell

545
00:24:09,764 --> 00:24:13,428
which tanks were on my team in general.

546
00:24:13,428 --> 00:24:15,950
I could never tell which ones I was controlling.

547
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:17,272
And similarly on the mini-map.

548
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,161
There was so much information.

549
00:24:20,161 --> 00:24:23,203
I've been told it was quite, actually,

550
00:24:23,203 --> 00:24:26,045
there were too many colors being used

551
00:24:26,045 --> 00:24:26,885
in too small of things.

552
00:24:26,885 --> 00:24:28,766
Like, this is blown up huge.

553
00:24:28,766 --> 00:24:30,868
This was a tight, this is like a couple of inches

554
00:24:30,868 --> 00:24:31,568
on the monitor.

555
00:24:31,568 --> 00:24:36,031
This is a small piece of UI with so much color information.

556
00:24:36,031 --> 00:24:39,933
Like, I couldn't tell when points were captured.

557
00:24:39,933 --> 00:24:41,714
The units on one side just looked like,

558
00:24:41,714 --> 00:24:43,875
I don't know, they're on a completely different team.

559
00:24:43,875 --> 00:24:44,516
I have no idea.

560
00:24:45,216 --> 00:24:47,518
And some of them I can't even really see.

561
00:24:47,518 --> 00:24:50,239
The dark ones blend into the background,

562
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:55,723
and the lighter ones look like a foreground UI element.

563
00:24:55,723 --> 00:24:58,244
It's very difficult to use.

564
00:24:58,244 --> 00:25:00,646
All right, let's play a game.

565
00:25:00,646 --> 00:25:03,288
Your base is under attack.

566
00:25:03,288 --> 00:25:06,750
There are two enemy units on that map.

567
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:07,971
Can you see them?

568
00:25:07,971 --> 00:25:10,132
There they are.

569
00:25:10,132 --> 00:25:12,894
And I should stress to you,

570
00:25:14,397 --> 00:25:17,059
In all of these slides where I'm showing you two pictures,

571
00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:19,982
they're exactly the same to me.

572
00:25:19,982 --> 00:25:22,284
I needed a lot of help to put this talk together

573
00:25:22,284 --> 00:25:25,046
to ensure that when I'm actually showing something,

574
00:25:25,046 --> 00:25:26,568
there is a difference.

575
00:25:26,568 --> 00:25:27,829
But I see two identical images.

576
00:25:27,829 --> 00:25:30,491
The one labeled deuteranopia, that's both of them for me.

577
00:25:31,251 --> 00:25:34,233
So, when I first demoed this talk,

578
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:35,934
I did make a mistake on one of the slides.

579
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:37,195
I put the same image up there twice.

580
00:25:37,195 --> 00:25:40,116
And I didn't know, because it looked the same either way.

581
00:25:40,116 --> 00:25:44,379
But yeah, so these were colors chosen

582
00:25:44,379 --> 00:25:46,000
to indicate the enemy,

583
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,342
versus my own friendly stuff for the campaign.

584
00:25:49,342 --> 00:25:52,324
And it didn't even occur to me until late in the project

585
00:25:52,324 --> 00:25:54,225
that, wait, how have we done this?

586
00:25:54,225 --> 00:25:55,766
Because I wasn't really seeing anything happening

587
00:25:55,766 --> 00:25:56,907
on the map.

588
00:25:56,907 --> 00:25:59,468
And I just thought we didn't show enemies on the map.

589
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:03,432
And it took a long time for me to realize this.

590
00:26:03,432 --> 00:26:08,137
Similarly, so this is one of our cards

591
00:26:08,137 --> 00:26:10,359
from the Blitz card mode.

592
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:14,542
And the three colors, the infantry,

593
00:26:14,542 --> 00:26:18,306
the cog for vehicles, and the aircraft.

594
00:26:18,306 --> 00:26:22,590
These two will be showing what is this card good against.

595
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:24,852
And this, and I.

596
00:26:26,963 --> 00:26:32,429
I think from what I've talked to people before, like this looks like it's new, to me at least,

597
00:26:32,429 --> 00:26:38,996
this looks like it's neutral against infantry and vehicles and probably bad against aircraft.

598
00:26:38,996 --> 00:26:39,957
But I think I'm wrong.

599
00:26:39,957 --> 00:26:44,682
I seem to remember the infantry, the chopper is actually very good against infantry, but

600
00:26:44,682 --> 00:26:45,503
I wouldn't be able to tell.

601
00:26:47,378 --> 00:26:49,400
And on top of this, we had a very complex palette.

602
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,724
We were trying to communicate so much all the time

603
00:26:52,724 --> 00:26:54,425
and trying to find information

604
00:26:54,425 --> 00:26:56,487
for what kind of weapons were being used

605
00:26:56,487 --> 00:26:59,350
and like the intensity of the weaponry

606
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:01,432
and which units were on which side.

607
00:27:01,432 --> 00:27:04,274
And then we're trying to,

608
00:27:04,274 --> 00:27:05,916
like our environments were different as well.

609
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:09,159
We wanted to bring out all the kind of lush halo worlds

610
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:11,061
and they're all exciting colors,

611
00:27:11,061 --> 00:27:13,143
but it was so complicated.

612
00:27:13,687 --> 00:27:17,169
Like, I can't, like, that red glow underneath the units,

613
00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:19,271
like, in that midst, I have no idea

614
00:27:19,271 --> 00:27:22,973
if I have units there as the red player.

615
00:27:22,973 --> 00:27:24,234
But I worked on this game.

616
00:27:24,234 --> 00:27:26,736
Why couldn't I solve any of these problems?

617
00:27:26,736 --> 00:27:29,138
Like, why couldn't I help point all these things out?

618
00:27:29,138 --> 00:27:32,300
And there's a missing link.

619
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:35,803
So, so these problems are invisible

620
00:27:35,803 --> 00:27:37,885
if you don't have any, I know,

621
00:27:37,885 --> 00:27:39,506
problems with your color vision.

622
00:27:39,506 --> 00:27:41,267
To steal the old programmer phrase,

623
00:27:41,267 --> 00:27:42,268
it works on my machine.

624
00:27:44,672 --> 00:27:53,942
But the features are often invisible to me.

625
00:27:53,942 --> 00:27:55,724
So I don't know your feature is there.

626
00:27:55,724 --> 00:27:57,025
I can't bring it up.

627
00:27:57,025 --> 00:27:58,366
And a practical example,

628
00:27:58,366 --> 00:28:01,690
so I was fortunate enough to work on Alien Isolation

629
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:04,072
as a senior audio QA.

630
00:28:04,072 --> 00:28:05,454
And while I was testing it,

631
00:28:05,973 --> 00:28:08,633
I would come up against these guys, the working Joes.

632
00:28:08,633 --> 00:28:11,014
Excellent.

633
00:28:11,014 --> 00:28:13,554
But I would get kind of really frustrated

634
00:28:13,554 --> 00:28:14,495
when I was testing with them

635
00:28:14,495 --> 00:28:16,975
because I would sometimes be hiding from one

636
00:28:16,975 --> 00:28:19,696
and then I would stand up and he'd see me

637
00:28:19,696 --> 00:28:21,016
and I think, oh, he's going to attack

638
00:28:21,016 --> 00:28:23,516
and he just says to me, good day.

639
00:28:23,516 --> 00:28:26,217
I thought you were aggressive

640
00:28:26,217 --> 00:28:27,697
and it was really annoying me

641
00:28:27,697 --> 00:28:30,238
that there was no way to tell visually

642
00:28:30,238 --> 00:28:31,318
if they were aggressive or not.

643
00:28:31,318 --> 00:28:33,058
But of course they was.

644
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:36,772
And I didn't realize this until we were in finaling,

645
00:28:36,772 --> 00:28:40,475
about a month or two out, that the eyes change color.

646
00:28:40,475 --> 00:28:41,616
They glow.

647
00:28:41,616 --> 00:28:43,037
But to me, with the color blindness,

648
00:28:43,037 --> 00:28:45,980
it would be like this for deuteranopes and protanopes,

649
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,961
possibly tritanopes as well.

650
00:28:47,961 --> 00:28:50,743
There is no glow at all.

651
00:28:50,743 --> 00:28:52,024
It isn't just that the color is wrong,

652
00:28:52,024 --> 00:28:54,106
it's just the light doesn't arrive in my eyes.

653
00:28:54,106 --> 00:28:58,610
And so, but I didn't know the feature was there,

654
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:00,511
and they didn't know it was broken.

655
00:29:00,511 --> 00:29:03,433
And so, where was the conversation going to start?

656
00:29:04,198 --> 00:29:06,419
I mean, there was no one's job to bring this up.

657
00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:10,840
Another one in Kinect Star Wars,

658
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,121
we had a pod racing mode, which uses a racing line

659
00:29:13,121 --> 00:29:15,242
with all the color schemes you expect in Forza

660
00:29:15,242 --> 00:29:17,503
and Gran Turismo and all of these now,

661
00:29:17,503 --> 00:29:20,224
where they go red in the breaking zones.

662
00:29:20,224 --> 00:29:21,965
I didn't know this at the time.

663
00:29:21,965 --> 00:29:24,206
And then I got given a test case as a tester there.

664
00:29:24,904 --> 00:29:27,529
to ensure that these were working.

665
00:29:27,529 --> 00:29:31,817
To ensure that the line goes red in the breaking zones.

666
00:29:31,817 --> 00:29:34,542
To which my question was, wait, does it?

667
00:29:34,542 --> 00:29:35,364
Is it supposed to?

668
00:29:36,364 --> 00:29:38,345
And people around said, yeah, it does.

669
00:29:38,345 --> 00:29:41,387
Well, I said, this isn't a colorblind friendly feature.

670
00:29:41,387 --> 00:29:43,428
Can we do something about it?

671
00:29:43,428 --> 00:29:47,070
And the response was, well, this is how Forza

672
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:49,532
and everybody else does it.

673
00:29:49,532 --> 00:29:49,672
It is?

674
00:29:49,672 --> 00:29:52,133
This is what everyone else does?

675
00:29:52,133 --> 00:29:56,736
But I had no idea, like, until I saw this one test case

676
00:29:56,736 --> 00:29:59,598
that this is why, well, okay, it's not the only reason

677
00:29:59,598 --> 00:30:01,339
I suck at racing games, but it's a good excuse.

678
00:30:01,339 --> 00:30:02,760
Right, let's do something about this.

679
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,301
We can solve these problems, though.

680
00:30:04,301 --> 00:30:05,982
Like, it's, yeah.

681
00:30:07,623 --> 00:30:09,044
First one is an easy one.

682
00:30:09,044 --> 00:30:13,385
Don't just use color for any information you're trying to give.

683
00:30:13,385 --> 00:30:17,606
This is directly from the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.

684
00:30:17,606 --> 00:30:21,607
Websites have strict guidelines they have to abide by,

685
00:30:21,607 --> 00:30:23,627
and this is one of them.

686
00:30:23,627 --> 00:30:27,648
So color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information,

687
00:30:27,648 --> 00:30:29,348
indicating an action, prompting a response,

688
00:30:29,348 --> 00:30:31,149
or distinguishing a visual element.

689
00:30:32,684 --> 00:30:35,366
The WCAG guidelines are quite extensive

690
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:38,709
and they are built on years of industrial practice

691
00:30:38,709 --> 00:30:41,671
and that road is also paved with lawsuits.

692
00:30:41,671 --> 00:30:42,192
They are serious.

693
00:30:42,192 --> 00:30:48,657
But of course, games are complicated, especially this bit,

694
00:30:48,657 --> 00:30:51,339
which I am ironically distinguishing with color.

695
00:30:51,339 --> 00:30:55,282
So, because our games are, there's a whole world.

696
00:30:55,282 --> 00:30:56,664
There's a whole world.

697
00:30:56,664 --> 00:30:58,985
We're trying to show different elements within.

698
00:30:58,985 --> 00:31:00,186
So you can see, like,

699
00:31:00,858 --> 00:31:02,899
And websites, you don't have to be able to tell

700
00:31:02,899 --> 00:31:04,639
if you can see a car from something

701
00:31:04,639 --> 00:31:07,821
or spot something in camouflage.

702
00:31:07,821 --> 00:31:10,462
But there are things we can do about this, too.

703
00:31:10,462 --> 00:31:12,683
So if you want your game to be readable,

704
00:31:12,683 --> 00:31:14,003
you can think about palette design.

705
00:31:14,003 --> 00:31:16,464
There is research done, there are resources done.

706
00:31:16,464 --> 00:31:18,805
Sorry, there are resources out there

707
00:31:18,805 --> 00:31:22,727
for you to be able to create a palette

708
00:31:22,727 --> 00:31:27,569
with no colors that are

709
00:31:27,569 --> 00:31:28,990
imperceptible to the colorblind.

710
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:34,756
And this is a very good, this is a good standard practice.

711
00:31:34,756 --> 00:31:38,037
If you don't want to have to think too much about it,

712
00:31:38,037 --> 00:31:39,857
if you can build this into a standard practice

713
00:31:39,857 --> 00:31:41,678
to make it, and you want a readable game,

714
00:31:41,678 --> 00:31:45,179
these resources are out there, and they are really good.

715
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:48,400
All these slides will be available on the vault afterwards,

716
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,761
but take as many pictures as you like.

717
00:31:50,761 --> 00:31:52,082
But of course this doesn't cover everything,

718
00:31:52,082 --> 00:31:54,883
because as I said, we reinvent our games all the time,

719
00:31:54,883 --> 00:31:56,323
and we reinvent our problems all the time.

720
00:31:58,105 --> 00:31:58,826
Here's an easy one.

721
00:31:58,826 --> 00:32:03,147
If you have two things and you can't have them get mixed up,

722
00:32:03,147 --> 00:32:05,168
blue and orange, every time.

723
00:32:05,168 --> 00:32:07,889
I know Portal, excellent example.

724
00:32:07,889 --> 00:32:10,731
Even in the early days of Halo, red versus blue.

725
00:32:10,731 --> 00:32:13,892
I know red and orange are pretty close,

726
00:32:13,892 --> 00:32:15,953
but these, they will not go wrong.

727
00:32:15,953 --> 00:32:20,375
Not for the three types of color blindness.

728
00:32:20,375 --> 00:32:23,856
For achromatopsia, I don't think it covers that,

729
00:32:23,856 --> 00:32:26,217
unless you looked at the brightness.

730
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:29,812
But there's further you can go into this,

731
00:32:29,812 --> 00:32:31,193
because the games are all different.

732
00:32:31,193 --> 00:32:33,094
So what's your game like?

733
00:32:33,094 --> 00:32:34,355
How are you using color?

734
00:32:34,355 --> 00:32:36,977
And what do you think, what is a color feature

735
00:32:36,977 --> 00:32:41,440
that is, you never thought was a color feature?

736
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,382
So in your puzzles, you don't realize

737
00:32:44,382 --> 00:32:47,343
that the colors distinguish different elements.

738
00:32:47,343 --> 00:32:52,727
In maps, the infamous red X of the Sea of Thieves map,

739
00:32:52,727 --> 00:32:54,368
X marks the spot for the treasure.

740
00:32:54,368 --> 00:32:55,909
I can't see the X.

741
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:59,030
They have actually fixed that now.

742
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,871
They allow high contrast mode in the map.

743
00:33:00,871 --> 00:33:01,651
Thank you, Rare.

744
00:33:01,651 --> 00:33:05,994
Also, all of your UI information.

745
00:33:05,994 --> 00:33:08,115
So, like, here's FTL with a huge complex array

746
00:33:08,115 --> 00:33:10,756
of different hues and things like that.

747
00:33:10,756 --> 00:33:12,777
So, think about how you are using this.

748
00:33:12,777 --> 00:33:15,299
And, of course, your team color is really obvious.

749
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:16,720
Are your items different?

750
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,381
So, I think these are the Resident Evil herbs,

751
00:33:19,381 --> 00:33:20,982
like the red, green, and blue.

752
00:33:20,982 --> 00:33:24,484
I don't want to spaff a really good...

753
00:33:24,484 --> 00:33:26,125
I don't want to use a really good plant on...

754
00:33:26,682 --> 00:33:27,943
when I've only got a tiny bit of health,

755
00:33:27,943 --> 00:33:28,984
I don't want to waste the resource,

756
00:33:28,984 --> 00:33:31,886
I want to be able to make the decision.

757
00:33:31,886 --> 00:33:34,609
And lights, like I said, in the real world,

758
00:33:34,609 --> 00:33:38,072
lights are difficult, in games, lights are difficult,

759
00:33:38,072 --> 00:33:40,393
because it's a huge amount, it's just brightness,

760
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:43,276
and they start to all become bright white lights.

761
00:33:43,276 --> 00:33:44,597
I was trying to go the wrong way

762
00:33:44,597 --> 00:33:48,760
down these trading lanes in Freelancer,

763
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,761
again and again and again,

764
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:52,363
and I got me killed by pirates so many times.

765
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:53,224
And text.

766
00:33:56,456 --> 00:33:57,457
Text as well.

767
00:33:57,457 --> 00:34:00,439
This is an example where it's okay.

768
00:34:00,439 --> 00:34:04,342
Largely because the orientation is the same.

769
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:07,065
The orientation is part of the language as well.

770
00:34:07,065 --> 00:34:09,206
So you generally would never get the paragon lines

771
00:34:09,206 --> 00:34:11,548
in Mass Effect at the bottom, like in blue.

772
00:34:11,548 --> 00:34:12,689
And you wouldn't get the rebel ones,

773
00:34:12,689 --> 00:34:15,231
or the renegade ones in red up at the top.

774
00:34:15,231 --> 00:34:18,334
So this is a decent example.

775
00:34:18,334 --> 00:34:21,977
But it's also, as you're figuring out which of these are...

776
00:34:23,287 --> 00:34:25,389
and that your features is your palette

777
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:27,211
just going to wipe them all out.

778
00:34:27,211 --> 00:34:30,314
You need to see everything in context.

779
00:34:30,314 --> 00:34:32,016
But some of us work on big teams.

780
00:34:32,016 --> 00:34:33,758
Some of us have a lot of deadlines to get through.

781
00:34:33,758 --> 00:34:34,859
People are stressed.

782
00:34:34,859 --> 00:34:37,381
People, you don't have time for everyone

783
00:34:37,381 --> 00:34:39,123
to be thinking about colorblindness all the time.

784
00:34:39,123 --> 00:34:40,805
So you can do some of that work up ahead.

785
00:34:40,805 --> 00:34:44,128
So if you need certain pieces of information

786
00:34:44,128 --> 00:34:46,770
communicated within your games through color,

787
00:34:47,382 --> 00:34:50,143
then give your artists a preset.

788
00:34:50,143 --> 00:34:51,264
So figure out what they are.

789
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:53,445
Like this is an example I came up with,

790
00:34:53,445 --> 00:34:54,866
but we'll see a real game,

791
00:34:54,866 --> 00:34:57,368
we'll see a real world example in a game later

792
00:34:57,368 --> 00:34:58,608
where this is exactly what they did.

793
00:35:00,942 --> 00:35:02,603
And you can give these to your designers.

794
00:35:02,603 --> 00:35:04,605
You can allow them to just, I don't know, say, right,

795
00:35:04,605 --> 00:35:07,588
I know your designers and artists just have to, like,

796
00:35:07,588 --> 00:35:11,311
right, tag this as enemy, tag this as friendly.

797
00:35:11,311 --> 00:35:12,452
Now, just in script.

798
00:35:12,452 --> 00:35:14,554
Or if you have faction colors, then just say, right,

799
00:35:14,554 --> 00:35:17,597
map this to, I know, the color for faction A.

800
00:35:17,597 --> 00:35:19,699
Make it a preset so they don't have to,

801
00:35:19,699 --> 00:35:21,800
they don't have to spend time balancing the color itself.

802
00:35:24,395 --> 00:35:26,956
And you can use the color-safe palettes to inform all of this.

803
00:35:26,956 --> 00:35:29,516
So make sure they're clear.

804
00:35:29,516 --> 00:35:31,917
But then, of course, always test them in context.

805
00:35:31,917 --> 00:35:35,439
Ideally, with colorblind people.

806
00:35:35,439 --> 00:35:38,500
So if your company is large, there are probably some.

807
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,380
I think pretty much nearly everyone here

808
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:43,541
raised their hand and said they know someone

809
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:44,722
with colorblindness.

810
00:35:44,722 --> 00:35:44,922
Exactly.

811
00:35:44,922 --> 00:35:46,823
And ask them, or ask me.

812
00:35:46,823 --> 00:35:49,183
Everyone wants this to work.

813
00:35:49,183 --> 00:35:51,204
And so we're all happy to talk about it.

814
00:35:52,627 --> 00:35:57,128
And also, this allows for your artists and designers

815
00:35:57,128 --> 00:35:58,909
to be safe in creating their game

816
00:35:58,909 --> 00:36:02,210
and knowing they don't have to worry about this aspect

817
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:03,951
as much as they have to.

818
00:36:03,951 --> 00:36:07,552
If you're leading accessibility on your project,

819
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:09,413
you can do a lot of the worrying for them,

820
00:36:09,413 --> 00:36:11,154
and they can just focus on the design.

821
00:36:11,154 --> 00:36:13,875
It's what you want to enable.

822
00:36:13,875 --> 00:36:17,656
And you can systematically manage it.

823
00:36:19,647 --> 00:36:25,451
If you user test it and you see that there is a problem in one of these presets or in one of the modes,

824
00:36:25,451 --> 00:36:27,332
then you can change this as a category.

825
00:36:27,332 --> 00:36:31,795
Make things easy for yourself to manage these deliveries.

826
00:36:31,795 --> 00:36:35,838
And there are also, of course, lots and lots of colorblind simulated tools.

827
00:36:35,838 --> 00:36:37,019
There are more and more.

828
00:36:37,019 --> 00:36:40,602
Every time I give this talk, I've heard about another one.

829
00:36:40,602 --> 00:36:40,662
So...

830
00:36:42,056 --> 00:36:44,276
just some examples for you.

831
00:36:44,276 --> 00:36:46,257
So Color Oracle is a free one.

832
00:36:46,257 --> 00:36:47,597
Unity has a package.

833
00:36:47,597 --> 00:36:48,918
Unreal has a preview package.

834
00:36:48,918 --> 00:36:50,498
Photoshop has a simulator.

835
00:36:50,498 --> 00:36:52,639
There's a real-time one called SimDaltonism.

836
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:54,179
Chrome has plugins.

837
00:36:54,179 --> 00:36:57,640
And I have been using this to create this presentation.

838
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:00,541
So this Cobolist colorblindness simulator,

839
00:37:00,541 --> 00:37:02,162
you just, and it's browser-based.

840
00:37:02,162 --> 00:37:03,922
You drag an image into it,

841
00:37:03,922 --> 00:37:05,383
and you can just click through

842
00:37:05,383 --> 00:37:07,404
the different simulator types and see

843
00:37:07,404 --> 00:37:09,284
how do colorblind people see it.

844
00:37:09,284 --> 00:37:09,564
And.

845
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:15,433
Another key part of this is, like I mentioned before,

846
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:17,035
who starts the conversation?

847
00:37:17,035 --> 00:37:18,697
And it's you, it has to be you,

848
00:37:18,697 --> 00:37:20,860
because people that can't see the features

849
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,062
can't talk about them.

850
00:37:22,062 --> 00:37:23,283
So you have to reach out,

851
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:25,406
and I'm so glad to say this is already happening

852
00:37:25,406 --> 00:37:28,390
at my company since I started hopping on about all of this.

853
00:37:29,127 --> 00:37:31,489
People come to me, people come to me and say,

854
00:37:31,489 --> 00:37:34,151
hey, I'm working on this feature, can you see this?

855
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:36,013
I'm making this puzzle, can you see this?

856
00:37:36,013 --> 00:37:38,535
I'm getting it from both the teams in Creative Assembly

857
00:37:38,535 --> 00:37:42,018
and it's awesome and this is how it should be.

858
00:37:42,018 --> 00:37:46,001
And it's just a matter of education, which is great.

859
00:37:46,001 --> 00:37:51,245
And right, so yeah, keep reaching out

860
00:37:51,245 --> 00:37:51,966
to the people you know.

861
00:37:51,966 --> 00:37:54,648
Let's see how some of these solutions work in games.

862
00:37:56,222 --> 00:37:59,585
So Hue, I think came out last year.

863
00:37:59,585 --> 00:38:01,767
So this is clearly a color game

864
00:38:01,767 --> 00:38:04,109
which is gonna have a lot of trouble

865
00:38:04,109 --> 00:38:05,911
for someone like myself

866
00:38:05,911 --> 00:38:07,352
because it's all about matching colors

867
00:38:07,352 --> 00:38:10,955
and changing different colors of environmental things.

868
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:15,419
But they knew, they thought about it.

869
00:38:15,419 --> 00:38:16,760
And their colorblind mode

870
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,361
was simply give everything symbols.

871
00:38:19,362 --> 00:38:22,244
I give everything something that people can definitely match.

872
00:38:22,244 --> 00:38:23,805
And the game isn't too fast-paced.

873
00:38:23,805 --> 00:38:26,848
You can take your time to observe these symbols,

874
00:38:26,848 --> 00:38:28,529
even though they can be a bit small.

875
00:38:28,529 --> 00:38:29,690
You have the time.

876
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:30,930
And it enables me to play the game.

877
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:34,153
This isn't a game where I have any trouble at all.

878
00:38:34,153 --> 00:38:35,193
Left 4 Dead.

879
00:38:35,193 --> 00:38:39,096
So Left 4 Dead has some complex color information going on.

880
00:38:39,096 --> 00:38:41,978
So there's apparently an enemy

881
00:38:41,978 --> 00:38:44,040
on top of a friendly there for me.

882
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:47,362
But they just look like a lump of enemy.

883
00:38:47,722 --> 00:38:50,223
I don't even really know, they look the same.

884
00:38:50,223 --> 00:38:51,683
But I never had any problem with FFDead

885
00:38:51,683 --> 00:38:53,744
because it launched with a colorblind mode.

886
00:38:53,744 --> 00:38:56,485
So for example, there were three colors on display here.

887
00:38:56,485 --> 00:38:57,846
I can see them all.

888
00:38:57,846 --> 00:39:01,227
This is what the colorblind mode looks like.

889
00:39:01,227 --> 00:39:03,188
So the enemy is, I can see the enemy

890
00:39:03,188 --> 00:39:04,629
is about to drop onto a friendly.

891
00:39:04,629 --> 00:39:07,670
I can see there are at least one more friendly on the floor.

892
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:10,511
And I can see there was a fully healthy friendly

893
00:39:10,511 --> 00:39:11,752
on the right-hand side.

894
00:39:11,752 --> 00:39:15,753
Like I can see everything you can see when this works.

895
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:16,413
And it's fantastic.

896
00:39:17,914 --> 00:39:19,195
So, faster than light, FTL.

897
00:39:19,195 --> 00:39:22,559
So they had so much UI information going on,

898
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:24,721
like different statuses,

899
00:39:24,721 --> 00:39:26,723
and then the rooms would change color

900
00:39:26,723 --> 00:39:29,586
to show that they were running out of oxygen and stuff.

901
00:39:29,586 --> 00:39:32,589
And it was like, oh, like, but I, but no, no,

902
00:39:32,589 --> 00:39:34,992
I never had a problem because they thought about it too.

903
00:39:34,992 --> 00:39:36,713
So with the colorblind mode.

904
00:39:37,979 --> 00:39:44,104
they overhauled all the depths of color and information

905
00:39:44,104 --> 00:39:47,426
and all of the oxygen, there was a crosshatch

906
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:49,007
when a room was out of oxygen.

907
00:39:49,007 --> 00:39:52,130
Like it was night and day, even for me,

908
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:54,712
to see that, to get the information I needed

909
00:39:54,712 --> 00:39:57,294
to play the game and get my dudes out of that room.

910
00:39:57,294 --> 00:40:01,357
So I'm quite pleased to say we've done some of this work

911
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:02,838
in Total War Warhammer as well.

912
00:40:02,838 --> 00:40:05,880
Total War Warhammer 2 is actually the first time

913
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,681
we've brought in our.

914
00:40:07,172 --> 00:40:08,654
Colorblind Modes at Creative Assembly.

915
00:40:08,654 --> 00:40:11,116
I'm so pleased to see this is happening.

916
00:40:11,116 --> 00:40:11,537
It's just a start.

917
00:40:11,537 --> 00:40:12,198
To show you what they do,

918
00:40:12,198 --> 00:40:15,962
so Total War is complicated.

919
00:40:15,962 --> 00:40:18,504
We have complicated battlefield.

920
00:40:18,504 --> 00:40:19,886
There is so much information.

921
00:40:19,886 --> 00:40:21,247
There are so many things going on,

922
00:40:21,247 --> 00:40:26,293
but the key part is who are my friends

923
00:40:26,293 --> 00:40:27,674
and who are my enemies?

924
00:40:27,674 --> 00:40:29,176
And normally I have no idea.

925
00:40:31,283 --> 00:40:31,804
but I do now.

926
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:35,765
The colors may, to an art director's eye,

927
00:40:35,765 --> 00:40:38,105
they might not be ultimately pleasing,

928
00:40:38,105 --> 00:40:39,245
but they don't have to care.

929
00:40:39,245 --> 00:40:41,066
They can play the normal mode.

930
00:40:41,066 --> 00:40:41,946
I can play this one.

931
00:40:41,946 --> 00:40:42,886
Everybody wins.

932
00:40:42,886 --> 00:40:46,227
I have the option to make the game playable for me,

933
00:40:46,227 --> 00:40:48,288
and that is what I need.

934
00:40:48,288 --> 00:40:52,789
Similarly, text, and this is actually the slide

935
00:40:52,789 --> 00:40:54,269
I got wrong that one time,

936
00:40:54,269 --> 00:40:56,790
because I'd put up that image twice.

937
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:58,990
So I think this one should be clear this time.

938
00:41:00,735 --> 00:41:03,197
And so, yeah, I can't tell.

939
00:41:03,197 --> 00:41:07,000
So for example, where it says winded and tired,

940
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:07,701
those are problems.

941
00:41:07,701 --> 00:41:08,901
That is where you need action.

942
00:41:08,901 --> 00:41:10,243
They are in danger.

943
00:41:10,243 --> 00:41:13,845
But it looks so similar to an eager or high ground,

944
00:41:13,845 --> 00:41:15,326
flank secure.

945
00:41:15,326 --> 00:41:20,390
Like I can't make decisions using these colors.

946
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:20,891
But now I can.

947
00:41:22,131 --> 00:41:28,277
They might not be as intuitive as the colors we're used to using.

948
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:36,244
We always want to use red for danger and green for good, but colorblind people just can't

949
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:37,765
process these.

950
00:41:37,765 --> 00:41:44,191
And so the most important part is give them the information to play with and let them

951
00:41:44,191 --> 00:41:44,691
play your game.

952
00:41:47,313 --> 00:41:49,034
Overwatch, this was an interesting example.

953
00:41:49,034 --> 00:41:51,515
So, of course, as I said before,

954
00:41:51,515 --> 00:41:53,016
there was a hell of a lot going on.

955
00:41:53,016 --> 00:41:56,077
Like there's a different,

956
00:41:56,077 --> 00:41:58,838
there are different UI categories they need,

957
00:41:58,838 --> 00:42:00,219
and their characters are busy,

958
00:42:00,219 --> 00:42:03,080
and the colors are mixed against the background.

959
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,822
It's difficult, you need a lot, and it's a fast game.

960
00:42:05,822 --> 00:42:08,443
You need to be able to make decisions like that.

961
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:12,645
But their colorblind modes, I tried them out,

962
00:42:12,645 --> 00:42:14,506
and they work quite right.

963
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:16,815
So there was still the problem.

964
00:42:16,815 --> 00:42:19,039
So the characters were a bit easier to distinguish

965
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:21,383
from the backgrounds now, but the colors had changed

966
00:42:21,383 --> 00:42:26,191
and Enemy and Friendly had kind of become the same.

967
00:42:27,917 --> 00:42:31,099
I still couldn't really know how to shoot, or who to shoot.

968
00:42:31,099 --> 00:42:34,321
And this actually affected who I chose as characters.

969
00:42:34,321 --> 00:42:37,502
So are there any Ana mains here that play Overwatch?

970
00:42:37,502 --> 00:42:38,743
Yes, my people.

971
00:42:38,743 --> 00:42:40,864
But the reason I picked Ana was because

972
00:42:40,864 --> 00:42:42,245
it doesn't matter who I shoot.

973
00:42:42,245 --> 00:42:43,326
Because if it's an enemy, it hurts them,

974
00:42:43,326 --> 00:42:44,966
and if it's a friendly, it heals them.

975
00:42:44,966 --> 00:42:46,407
So that's why I picked them.

976
00:42:46,407 --> 00:42:50,009
And similarly with Orisa, any Orisa mains?

977
00:42:50,009 --> 00:42:50,990
There aren't many anyway.

978
00:42:52,183 --> 00:42:55,426
She had a secondary ability which would pull all enemies into an area.

979
00:42:55,426 --> 00:43:01,512
Just to kind of make them easier to, like, either to pull them off a ledge or pull them out from behind cover of things.

980
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:05,556
I would use it to tell, in a group of people, which ones were my enemies.

981
00:43:05,556 --> 00:43:08,158
That's what that enabled me to do.

982
00:43:08,158 --> 00:43:11,501
And it's just an accident, but it affected my decisions in playing the game.

983
00:43:13,834 --> 00:43:18,280
There is a streamer called Colorblind, and she does...

984
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:23,207
She has, I think, protanopia, and has a lot of...

985
00:43:24,154 --> 00:43:26,616
a lot of videos, quite passionate videos,

986
00:43:26,616 --> 00:43:29,980
going into what these colorblind modes are,

987
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:32,202
like how they're a problem, where they're a problem.

988
00:43:32,202 --> 00:43:35,425
They're really good examples of where it can

989
00:43:35,425 --> 00:43:37,867
be difficult to achieve this.

990
00:43:37,867 --> 00:43:41,751
There's some very good ones of, there's

991
00:43:41,751 --> 00:43:43,893
a very passionate video of her trying the Enchroma classes

992
00:43:43,893 --> 00:43:44,113
as well.

993
00:43:44,113 --> 00:43:46,355
It's like, it's quite heart-wrenching.

994
00:43:46,355 --> 00:43:47,176
Sorry.

995
00:43:49,037 --> 00:43:53,120
So, color selection controls are the most exciting one.

996
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:55,402
This is giving me the power to fix the problem.

997
00:43:55,402 --> 00:43:59,084
So, AudioSurf, you have to match five colors, and fast.

998
00:43:59,084 --> 00:44:03,787
Having five colors that are distinct to a colorblind person is really hard.

999
00:44:03,787 --> 00:44:04,388
So don't try.

1000
00:44:04,388 --> 00:44:06,890
Give me the buttons, and I'll figure it out myself.

1001
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:13,774
And I can make sure it works for me, and you don't even have to know what I see.

1002
00:44:13,774 --> 00:44:17,857
You don't have to understand my condition to be able to help me.

1003
00:44:18,978 --> 00:44:20,399
and this is perfect.

1004
00:44:20,399 --> 00:44:22,340
Even some games would do it by mistake.

1005
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:25,081
So Worms Armageddon, like all that time ago,

1006
00:44:25,081 --> 00:44:27,102
I used to play with friends a lot,

1007
00:44:27,102 --> 00:44:29,483
but with my friends, if I'm talking to my friends,

1008
00:44:29,483 --> 00:44:32,265
I can agree with them which colors

1009
00:44:32,265 --> 00:44:33,925
they were to allow me to play.

1010
00:44:33,925 --> 00:44:35,866
So they could play the dark colors

1011
00:44:35,866 --> 00:44:37,747
and I could just be yellow.

1012
00:44:37,747 --> 00:44:40,409
I can see that against all the others.

1013
00:44:40,409 --> 00:44:41,429
Same with Red Alert.

1014
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:43,430
They would let me pick the light blue, whatever,

1015
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:46,432
just so I could play the game with my friends,

1016
00:44:46,432 --> 00:44:47,252
which is what everyone wants.

1017
00:44:47,252 --> 00:44:47,512
And in fact.

1018
00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:50,139
I called out Overwatch earlier.

1019
00:44:50,139 --> 00:44:52,200
They have improved recently.

1020
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,701
They are, I'm so pleased that they are still working on it.

1021
00:44:55,701 --> 00:44:57,642
Like, I don't know the names of the people in Blizzard

1022
00:44:57,642 --> 00:45:00,003
working on accessibility, but I'm really thankful

1023
00:45:00,003 --> 00:45:03,984
that their mission continues, because this is a big change.

1024
00:45:03,984 --> 00:45:06,966
So having, I can now set Enemy and Friendly

1025
00:45:06,966 --> 00:45:08,926
to be completely different colors.

1026
00:45:08,926 --> 00:45:10,507
So like, I've picked their blue and yellow.

1027
00:45:11,226 --> 00:45:13,067
It's almost there.

1028
00:45:13,067 --> 00:45:14,648
If I can choose the group color as well,

1029
00:45:14,648 --> 00:45:15,849
then I can make it all work out.

1030
00:45:15,849 --> 00:45:17,770
But because the group color was,

1031
00:45:17,770 --> 00:45:20,572
at least last time I played, still locked to orange,

1032
00:45:20,572 --> 00:45:22,693
I kind of had to have the colors

1033
00:45:22,693 --> 00:45:24,934
the other way around to what was perfect.

1034
00:45:24,934 --> 00:45:27,976
It was better, but it's almost there.

1035
00:45:27,976 --> 00:45:31,718
And now we come full circle back to Battlefield.

1036
00:45:32,286 --> 00:45:36,429
So Battlefield brought in a colorblind mode

1037
00:45:36,429 --> 00:45:39,931
late in, about nine months after release of Battlefield 3.

1038
00:45:39,931 --> 00:45:42,693
They saw the problems that were there

1039
00:45:42,693 --> 00:45:44,314
and they dealt with it.

1040
00:45:44,314 --> 00:45:46,135
But they have improved over time.

1041
00:45:46,135 --> 00:45:49,197
So this was several months ago,

1042
00:45:49,197 --> 00:45:50,838
this was in Battlefield 1, actually.

1043
00:45:50,838 --> 00:45:53,640
And for a while, they had colorblind modes,

1044
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:56,622
which, I know, separated squad, team, and enemy color.

1045
00:45:56,622 --> 00:45:57,843
I could choose different ones.

1046
00:45:57,843 --> 00:45:59,564
But they've upped their game.

1047
00:46:00,893 --> 00:46:02,915
this is amazing.

1048
00:46:02,915 --> 00:46:03,896
They don't even have to know

1049
00:46:03,896 --> 00:46:05,257
what type of colorblindness you are.

1050
00:46:05,257 --> 00:46:09,520
Like, I get a whole hue graph to choose from any colors.

1051
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,641
And I can, and I don't, this way,

1052
00:46:11,641 --> 00:46:14,663
I can make them not just be distinct from each other,

1053
00:46:14,663 --> 00:46:17,805
but I can pick colors that stand out from the environment.

1054
00:46:17,805 --> 00:46:20,567
Like, I can, I can stop, I can play this game

1055
00:46:20,567 --> 00:46:22,709
and forget I'm colorblind, which is the point,

1056
00:46:22,709 --> 00:46:23,870
which is exactly what I want.

1057
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:27,713
Like, and you can even do this

1058
00:46:27,713 --> 00:46:29,594
without thinking about color at all.

1059
00:46:30,374 --> 00:46:32,675
Like, so these two games, Gang Beasts and Star Wars.

1060
00:46:32,675 --> 00:46:35,457
It's like, I don't have to know what color my character is.

1061
00:46:35,457 --> 00:46:36,057
I'm a chicken.

1062
00:46:36,057 --> 00:46:38,798
That's all I have to know.

1063
00:46:38,798 --> 00:46:41,299
Or in Star Wars, like, I could just say,

1064
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:42,880
what color are you, sombrero?

1065
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:49,203
And, so this, like, it's a great part

1066
00:46:49,203 --> 00:46:50,184
of these kind of games anyway,

1067
00:46:50,184 --> 00:46:51,664
like, and they're giving the players a way

1068
00:46:51,664 --> 00:46:53,205
to choose their characters,

1069
00:46:53,205 --> 00:46:54,726
but it is an accessibility feature

1070
00:46:54,726 --> 00:46:57,327
that you didn't know you'd put in.

1071
00:46:57,327 --> 00:46:58,428
And it's excellent.

1072
00:46:59,827 --> 00:47:04,510
And of course, it's also important to make sure people can access the features you've got.

1073
00:47:05,433 --> 00:47:08,636
And so, Fortnite here, there was a whole tab.

1074
00:47:08,636 --> 00:47:09,697
Like, you go into the options menu,

1075
00:47:09,697 --> 00:47:12,079
and people can see there was an accessibility tab.

1076
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:15,241
Like, find a way to make people know

1077
00:47:15,241 --> 00:47:16,783
that there are accessibility features.

1078
00:47:16,783 --> 00:47:19,145
I didn't know, although I called out

1079
00:47:19,145 --> 00:47:21,347
AudioSurf as being really good,

1080
00:47:21,347 --> 00:47:24,489
it was a long time before I actually thought to look

1081
00:47:24,489 --> 00:47:26,231
or stumbled across it in the options menu.

1082
00:47:26,231 --> 00:47:28,212
I didn't think it would be there.

1083
00:47:28,212 --> 00:47:30,234
And so, you have to be better

1084
00:47:30,234 --> 00:47:31,976
than people's expectations of your game.

1085
00:47:32,924 --> 00:47:37,527
You have to be clear, like, I know, we support accessibility because

1086
00:47:37,527 --> 00:47:41,170
we're still, people still aren't, people are used to assuming they're not.

1087
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:44,212
And so, make a song and dance about it. It's great PR as well.

1088
00:47:44,212 --> 00:47:47,654
And, uh, Fortnite's one was particularly interesting

1089
00:47:47,654 --> 00:47:50,856
because people are actually getting diagnosed

1090
00:47:50,856 --> 00:47:52,537
almost, I know, accidentally through Fortnite.

1091
00:47:53,074 --> 00:47:56,515
Because people don't understand, there's a lot of young people playing.

1092
00:47:56,515 --> 00:47:58,336
Like, they, they, it's great.

1093
00:47:58,336 --> 00:48:00,017
They can't even say Tritanopia.

1094
00:48:00,017 --> 00:48:03,618
Like, I hear them on YouTube videos trying to talk about this.

1095
00:48:03,618 --> 00:48:05,859
But they can still make it work for them.

1096
00:48:05,859 --> 00:48:08,960
Because they just set the settings to work best for what they can see.

1097
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,241
They just, and they solved the llama puzzle for themselves.

1098
00:48:11,241 --> 00:48:11,801
It's perfect.

1099
00:48:11,801 --> 00:48:12,001
But it's...

1100
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:19,052
Something funny happened on Monday.

1101
00:48:19,052 --> 00:48:22,895
So at the Game Accessibility Conference,

1102
00:48:22,895 --> 00:48:25,317
Bryce Johnson was speaking about the Xbox Adaptive Game

1103
00:48:25,317 --> 00:48:27,479
Controller, which is incredible.

1104
00:48:27,479 --> 00:48:32,543
And there was a moment where they have audio transcripts.

1105
00:48:32,543 --> 00:48:34,225
So for deaf users watching.

1106
00:48:35,998 --> 00:48:39,941
there was a moment where he did an impression of someone.

1107
00:48:39,941 --> 00:48:40,721
And he was saying,

1108
00:48:40,721 --> 00:48:42,382
oh, why don't people always support these?

1109
00:48:42,382 --> 00:48:43,283
And he was doing an impression.

1110
00:48:43,283 --> 00:48:46,725
And so the typist wrote gamer bro voice.

1111
00:48:46,725 --> 00:48:52,950
And it came up on screen and people were laughing about it

1112
00:48:52,950 --> 00:48:56,272
and people were taking pictures.

1113
00:48:56,272 --> 00:48:57,373
But then she typed something else

1114
00:48:57,373 --> 00:48:58,233
and that's when I took a picture.

1115
00:48:58,233 --> 00:49:00,095
She typed the word blushing.

1116
00:49:00,095 --> 00:49:02,456
I knew someone was blushing.

1117
00:49:03,541 --> 00:49:07,342
This has never happened before.

1118
00:49:07,342 --> 00:49:09,203
So this was not an accessibility feature.

1119
00:49:09,203 --> 00:49:13,064
This was not an accessibility aimed to help colorblind people.

1120
00:49:13,064 --> 00:49:17,705
And in fact, this is something we should have here at GDC,

1121
00:49:17,705 --> 00:49:18,185
ideally.

1122
00:49:18,185 --> 00:49:19,766
I want to call that out.

1123
00:49:19,766 --> 00:49:23,067
We can and should be supporting these.

1124
00:49:23,067 --> 00:49:27,008
These talks should be accessible themselves.

1125
00:49:27,008 --> 00:49:29,949
So we should be focusing on having deaf support,

1126
00:49:29,949 --> 00:49:31,349
and mobility support.

1127
00:49:32,276 --> 00:49:34,696
But a key part is these features affect a lot.

1128
00:49:34,696 --> 00:49:37,517
These features help a lot of people all at once.

1129
00:49:37,517 --> 00:49:40,798
So this was a feature that ideally,

1130
00:49:40,798 --> 00:49:42,658
initially, to help deaf people,

1131
00:49:42,658 --> 00:49:47,279
but it also helps people with struggling attention spans

1132
00:49:47,279 --> 00:49:48,519
who can look back and then read,

1133
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:51,240
like if they phase out what someone was saying,

1134
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:52,460
they can still pick up on it.

1135
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:54,541
Some people taking information, better reading.

1136
00:49:54,541 --> 00:49:56,921
And I got to know when someone was blushing.

1137
00:49:56,921 --> 00:49:58,521
And this was.

1138
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:01,500
This is new, and we can think about this.

1139
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:04,041
So when you're thinking about colorblind features,

1140
00:50:04,041 --> 00:50:07,221
think further, because improving visual clarity

1141
00:50:07,221 --> 00:50:09,842
helps more than just people like me.

1142
00:50:09,842 --> 00:50:12,003
So it helps colorblind people,

1143
00:50:12,003 --> 00:50:15,043
but it also helps people with achromatopsia.

1144
00:50:15,043 --> 00:50:17,664
Like, it helps people with low vision issues.

1145
00:50:17,664 --> 00:50:19,084
Like, people get cataracts.

1146
00:50:19,084 --> 00:50:20,365
Like, we're all gonna be having

1147
00:50:20,365 --> 00:50:22,565
some of these problems someday, probably.

1148
00:50:22,565 --> 00:50:26,066
And then also brain injuries, impaired hearing.

1149
00:50:26,827 --> 00:50:29,767
the visual information becomes more and more important,

1150
00:50:29,767 --> 00:50:32,408
and the more, like, if you lose your hearing.

1151
00:50:32,408 --> 00:50:33,908
And so making it as clear as possible,

1152
00:50:33,908 --> 00:50:35,828
giving people the choice of how to manage it,

1153
00:50:35,828 --> 00:50:37,229
is so important.

1154
00:50:37,229 --> 00:50:38,569
And even cognitive disabilities.

1155
00:50:38,569 --> 00:50:42,990
So, so many of their issues are to do

1156
00:50:42,990 --> 00:50:44,110
with how they receive information.

1157
00:50:44,110 --> 00:50:47,351
And giving them control over the visual input they get

1158
00:50:47,351 --> 00:50:49,691
can enable new players all over again.

1159
00:50:49,691 --> 00:50:51,112
There's someone else that this helps.

1160
00:50:51,112 --> 00:50:51,392
It's everybody.

1161
00:50:57,815 --> 00:50:59,296
Let's go back to Fortnite for a moment.

1162
00:50:59,296 --> 00:51:02,998
So there is a tritanopia mode

1163
00:51:02,998 --> 00:51:06,560
that is used a lot in Fortnite,

1164
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,901
but there aren't many tritanopic players.

1165
00:51:08,901 --> 00:51:09,662
So who's playing this?

1166
00:51:09,662 --> 00:51:10,422
And it's everybody.

1167
00:51:10,422 --> 00:51:13,624
People are looking for the clearest way to play.

1168
00:51:13,624 --> 00:51:18,147
And so there are loads and loads of these videos saying,

1169
00:51:18,147 --> 00:51:22,149
here are the best colorblind settings you can have

1170
00:51:22,149 --> 00:51:24,930
to make Fortnite really easy to see.

1171
00:51:24,930 --> 00:51:27,112
Like it makes the loot show up, it makes the enemies show up.

1172
00:51:28,261 --> 00:51:30,302
And this shows you something.

1173
00:51:30,302 --> 00:51:33,064
This shows that people want a clear experience.

1174
00:51:33,064 --> 00:51:35,626
People want a clear and readable experience.

1175
00:51:35,626 --> 00:51:37,027
If you give them the choice,

1176
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:39,769
they ship the experience you want to do,

1177
00:51:39,769 --> 00:51:43,171
but give them the choice to tune it to themselves,

1178
00:51:43,171 --> 00:51:44,272
to make it perfect for them,

1179
00:51:44,272 --> 00:51:45,052
because we don't know.

1180
00:51:45,052 --> 00:51:45,913
Everyone is different.

1181
00:51:45,913 --> 00:51:51,397
But this is, you can help so many people

1182
00:51:51,397 --> 00:51:52,578
and bring on so many new players

1183
00:51:52,578 --> 00:51:56,020
and widen these communities so much more

1184
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:56,981
if you just think.

1185
00:51:57,944 --> 00:52:00,526
How many people can I help with this solution?

1186
00:52:00,526 --> 00:52:02,427
And work it in, think ahead.

1187
00:52:02,427 --> 00:52:04,348
So let's wrap this up.

1188
00:52:04,348 --> 00:52:05,669
So, key steps.

1189
00:52:05,669 --> 00:52:08,751
Understand your palette and your colorblind features.

1190
00:52:08,751 --> 00:52:10,452
What does your game do with color?

1191
00:52:10,452 --> 00:52:13,794
And don't just communicate with color either.

1192
00:52:13,794 --> 00:52:16,356
So, I think I've read those the wrong way around.

1193
00:52:18,765 --> 00:52:21,266
There are preview tools all over the place.

1194
00:52:21,266 --> 00:52:22,907
Use them, try to understand,

1195
00:52:22,907 --> 00:52:25,308
and do some of the work in advance

1196
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:27,289
to kind of get used to where there might be problems.

1197
00:52:27,289 --> 00:52:30,850
Over time, it will start to become intuitive.

1198
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:32,991
Use color preset systems if that works for people.

1199
00:52:32,991 --> 00:52:37,253
And, ah, I shuffled some of these last night

1200
00:52:37,253 --> 00:52:37,974
just to fit more in.

1201
00:52:37,974 --> 00:52:41,195
But ideally, find the best solutions for your game

1202
00:52:41,195 --> 00:52:43,316
and make them wide-reaching.

1203
00:52:43,316 --> 00:52:46,458
Think about how many people you can deal with

1204
00:52:46,458 --> 00:52:47,798
and with a single feature.

1205
00:52:49,463 --> 00:52:51,164
And also, but also test it.

1206
00:52:51,164 --> 00:52:55,445
So, and it's, there are consultants out there.

1207
00:52:55,445 --> 00:52:57,426
You know people, like, I know you may have friends

1208
00:52:57,426 --> 00:53:00,667
and relatives, and they will love to see this working.

1209
00:53:00,667 --> 00:53:02,167
Like, it's really exciting.

1210
00:53:02,167 --> 00:53:05,648
And also make sure people can find these options.

1211
00:53:05,648 --> 00:53:08,449
And of course your community, ask them for feedback.

1212
00:53:08,449 --> 00:53:10,670
Like, if you ask them, hey, are people having

1213
00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:12,411
accessibility options, people will say something,

1214
00:53:12,411 --> 00:53:15,151
and they will be so thrilled that you care,

1215
00:53:15,151 --> 00:53:17,512
because they don't know unless you say something.

1216
00:53:18,742 --> 00:53:22,123
And there's, I also, I want to talk about

1217
00:53:22,123 --> 00:53:23,503
how important this is for a moment.

1218
00:53:23,503 --> 00:53:26,824
So it doesn't, it doesn't always feel like it.

1219
00:53:26,824 --> 00:53:28,905
Colorblindness is just a frustration in life

1220
00:53:28,905 --> 00:53:30,445
most of the time.

1221
00:53:30,445 --> 00:53:33,406
But when I get to, when I get to a situation in a game,

1222
00:53:33,406 --> 00:53:34,186
I love video games.

1223
00:53:34,186 --> 00:53:37,047
And so many, so do some of the other colorblind players.

1224
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:37,907
They love them.

1225
00:53:37,907 --> 00:53:40,188
And then if you just hit a wall

1226
00:53:40,188 --> 00:53:44,169
because of something you can't change, it's heartbreaking.

1227
00:53:44,169 --> 00:53:46,070
And so this is.

1228
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:49,321
But here's the thing, when I say,

1229
00:53:49,321 --> 00:53:51,843
if someone is showing that they're trying,

1230
00:53:51,843 --> 00:53:53,805
so I don't care if the colorblind modes don't quite work.

1231
00:53:53,805 --> 00:53:56,087
I don't really care if they're broken.

1232
00:53:56,087 --> 00:53:57,508
Someone is trying to help me.

1233
00:53:57,508 --> 00:53:59,550
They're trying to solve a problem for me

1234
00:53:59,550 --> 00:54:00,430
that they can't even see.

1235
00:54:00,430 --> 00:54:03,553
They're doing this for me, and it's so important.

1236
00:54:03,553 --> 00:54:06,255
So I really mean this when I say thank you.

1237
00:54:06,255 --> 00:54:06,615
And that's it.

1238
00:54:06,615 --> 00:54:06,836
Thank you.

1239
00:54:06,836 --> 00:54:07,036
Thank you.

1240
00:54:07,036 --> 00:54:07,876
Thank you.

1241
00:54:19,154 --> 00:54:24,178
So we have five minutes for questions.

1242
00:54:24,178 --> 00:54:27,641
So please come up to the mics if you'd like to ask anything,

1243
00:54:27,641 --> 00:54:28,622
or find me afterwards.

1244
00:54:28,622 --> 00:54:29,802
Like, I'll just be outside.

1245
00:54:29,802 --> 00:54:33,806
And also, if you're going to take one picture today,

1246
00:54:33,806 --> 00:54:34,806
take that one.

1247
00:54:34,806 --> 00:54:34,946
Hello.

1248
00:54:34,946 --> 00:54:34,986
Hi.

1249
00:54:34,986 --> 00:54:36,688
One question for you.

1250
00:54:36,688 --> 00:54:43,173
Do you prefer the bespoke individual UI adjustments

1251
00:54:43,173 --> 00:54:46,616
for color, or doing whole screen color blindness color

1252
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:47,016
correction?

1253
00:54:49,317 --> 00:54:55,184
So do I prefer UI controls over changing the whole screen color?

1254
00:54:55,184 --> 00:54:57,387
So I think I prefer just changing the UI colors.

1255
00:54:57,387 --> 00:55:02,174
Because changing the whole screen, so think of it this way.

1256
00:55:02,174 --> 00:55:02,895
I'm glad I still have this.

1257
00:55:02,895 --> 00:55:05,358
So you see the strip where it says deuteranopia?

1258
00:55:05,358 --> 00:55:06,219
That's my world.

1259
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:09,241
I don't need my world changing.

1260
00:55:09,241 --> 00:55:11,803
I just want to know what the signs say.

1261
00:55:11,803 --> 00:55:14,185
So I think I would say I prefer,

1262
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:16,407
just give control over the UI.

1263
00:55:16,407 --> 00:55:17,768
I don't need the entire screen to change color.

1264
00:55:17,768 --> 00:55:20,249
Some people do that because they think

1265
00:55:20,249 --> 00:55:21,630
this will make it work,

1266
00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:24,513
and this will make it readable.

1267
00:55:24,513 --> 00:55:25,934
And sometimes it does,

1268
00:55:25,934 --> 00:55:27,235
but there is no guarantee that it does.

1269
00:55:27,235 --> 00:55:30,297
So it's whatever solves the problem.

1270
00:55:30,297 --> 00:55:32,258
Again, the best solution for your game.

1271
00:55:32,258 --> 00:55:33,699
But I think I prefer the UI.

1272
00:55:33,699 --> 00:55:34,600
Cool, thanks.

1273
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:35,040
Hello.

1274
00:55:35,902 --> 00:55:37,243
Great talk. Thank you very much.

1275
00:55:37,243 --> 00:55:41,466
I was wondering if you have any suggestions.

1276
00:55:41,466 --> 00:55:43,507
You talk about having color information

1277
00:55:43,507 --> 00:55:45,569
and then supporting it with other information.

1278
00:55:45,569 --> 00:55:48,371
Is there any best practice on developing a shape language

1279
00:55:48,371 --> 00:55:51,213
that's fast to identify different things

1280
00:55:51,213 --> 00:55:53,014
like in puzzle games or UI elements?

1281
00:55:53,962 --> 00:55:57,305
So is there a standard on developing shape languages for these?

1282
00:55:57,305 --> 00:56:03,371
I would say no, because the things you need to communicate with that shape language,

1283
00:56:03,371 --> 00:56:04,632
they change for every single game.

1284
00:56:04,632 --> 00:56:08,116
A lot of these kind of develop culturally.

1285
00:56:08,116 --> 00:56:12,600
So we have the play button for Go, we have the fast forward for Go forward.

1286
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,322
Those kind of built up over time.

1287
00:56:14,322 --> 00:56:14,902
But in short...

1288
00:56:16,138 --> 00:56:22,003
If you're not sure if your shape language works for people that can't see the colors,

1289
00:56:22,003 --> 00:56:23,885
then ask them.

1290
00:56:23,885 --> 00:56:28,109
So, bring in some people that can tell you exactly how they experience your game.

1291
00:56:28,109 --> 00:56:29,190
And that should be the best way.

1292
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:31,772
So, if you're not sure, ask.

1293
00:56:31,772 --> 00:56:32,072
Thank you.

1294
00:56:32,072 --> 00:56:32,252
Hello.

1295
00:56:32,252 --> 00:56:32,533
Thank you.

1296
00:56:32,533 --> 00:56:32,793
Thank you.

1297
00:56:32,793 --> 00:56:33,453
Thank you.

1298
00:56:33,453 --> 00:56:33,874
Thank you.

1299
00:56:33,874 --> 00:56:34,394
Thank you.

1300
00:56:34,394 --> 00:56:34,595
Thank you.

1301
00:56:34,595 --> 00:56:34,895
Thank you.

1302
00:56:34,895 --> 00:56:35,295
Thank you.

1303
00:56:35,295 --> 00:56:35,575
Thank you.

1304
00:56:35,575 --> 00:56:35,996
Thank you.

1305
00:56:36,449 --> 00:56:38,652
Hello.

1306
00:56:38,652 --> 00:56:40,254
So I was working on a game with my team,

1307
00:56:40,254 --> 00:56:42,657
and I was demoing it to a bunch of people

1308
00:56:42,657 --> 00:56:44,539
who worked in our organization.

1309
00:56:44,539 --> 00:56:48,944
And I started to realize from people playtesting

1310
00:56:48,944 --> 00:56:52,589
that they didn't understand when certain things were happening

1311
00:56:52,589 --> 00:56:56,354
in the game, because it was mostly color information.

1312
00:56:56,998 --> 00:56:58,919
and there was subtle movement on the screen.

1313
00:56:58,919 --> 00:57:01,180
But if you blinked, you basically would miss that

1314
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:02,400
and not know it was happening.

1315
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:06,282
And so I try to bring that to one of the producers

1316
00:57:06,282 --> 00:57:08,463
who is in charge of prioritizing what features

1317
00:57:08,463 --> 00:57:12,124
we would add to the game.

1318
00:57:12,124 --> 00:57:15,665
And a struggle that I encountered is that sometimes

1319
00:57:15,665 --> 00:57:18,526
they think that a bunch of other features

1320
00:57:18,526 --> 00:57:21,928
are a lot more important than accessibility.

1321
00:57:22,544 --> 00:57:25,787
And I wonder if you have any tips for communicating the

1322
00:57:25,787 --> 00:57:28,350
importance of accessibility early on, as opposed to

1323
00:57:28,350 --> 00:57:31,733
something that you tack on later once other, quote,

1324
00:57:31,733 --> 00:57:35,257
priority things are accomplished first.

1325
00:57:35,545 --> 00:57:41,150
I'm really glad you asked this question because I struggle with this as well.

1326
00:57:41,150 --> 00:57:45,213
So to summarize, the question being, how do you convince other people of the importance

1327
00:57:45,213 --> 00:57:48,816
of accessibility over the priority of other features?

1328
00:57:48,816 --> 00:57:50,837
So I struggle with this at Creative Assembly.

1329
00:57:50,837 --> 00:57:53,339
There is lots of important work to do.

1330
00:57:53,339 --> 00:57:55,741
And some of the things that I've found that have worked is, one...

1331
00:57:56,482 --> 00:57:57,502
going on about it.

1332
00:57:57,502 --> 00:58:00,324
Because I talk to people about it all the time

1333
00:58:00,324 --> 00:58:04,547
and other people, it steadily builds interest in a cultural way.

1334
00:58:04,547 --> 00:58:05,888
But also, when you're going to,

1335
00:58:05,888 --> 00:58:07,869
when you're trying to convince someone to do something,

1336
00:58:07,869 --> 00:58:12,813
especially if you're trying to convince a producer to do something,

1337
00:58:12,813 --> 00:58:14,093
don't make, find a way.

1338
00:58:15,485 --> 00:58:17,768
Make sure you arrive with a solution.

1339
00:58:17,768 --> 00:58:18,448
So something we can do,

1340
00:58:18,448 --> 00:58:20,070
because if you can give them a solution

1341
00:58:20,070 --> 00:58:22,753
that fits within the costs of their project

1342
00:58:22,753 --> 00:58:25,155
and fits within the timeframes of their project,

1343
00:58:25,155 --> 00:58:27,538
and they lose that first,

1344
00:58:27,538 --> 00:58:29,199
they lose the reason to knee-jerk no.

1345
00:58:29,199 --> 00:58:31,742
Like, and then it becomes something

1346
00:58:31,742 --> 00:58:33,184
you can think about and discuss.

1347
00:58:33,953 --> 00:58:39,217
And also, even if the feature comes late,

1348
00:58:39,217 --> 00:58:43,100
like even if, I know, because in a way,

1349
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:45,201
if this feature comes a little after release,

1350
00:58:45,201 --> 00:58:46,082
I've seen it happen in games,

1351
00:58:46,082 --> 00:58:48,464
and where, I know, their game is released,

1352
00:58:48,464 --> 00:58:50,986
and then accessibility features come in later,

1353
00:58:50,986 --> 00:58:52,126
it's better late than never.

1354
00:58:52,126 --> 00:58:53,607
Like, it's still in the right direction.

1355
00:58:53,607 --> 00:58:55,529
And also, if it's developed then for,

1356
00:58:55,529 --> 00:58:57,771
if you're doing sequels or DLC, you've got it now.

1357
00:58:58,422 --> 00:59:01,323
And so that's what I'd advise is,

1358
00:59:01,323 --> 00:59:03,964
educate as many people as you can about the reality,

1359
00:59:03,964 --> 00:59:07,786
and ideally give people actionable solutions

1360
00:59:07,786 --> 00:59:08,966
to help them help.

1361
00:59:08,966 --> 00:59:10,567
Because most people want to,

1362
00:59:10,567 --> 00:59:12,688
they just don't know what to do.

1363
00:59:12,688 --> 00:59:13,408
Thank you.

1364
00:59:13,408 --> 00:59:13,588
Thanks.

1365
00:59:13,588 --> 00:59:16,790
I think we're there.

1366
00:59:16,790 --> 00:59:18,290
Thank you so much for coming.

1367
00:59:18,290 --> 00:59:19,071
Thank you.
