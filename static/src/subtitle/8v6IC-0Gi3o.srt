1
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:12,530
Thank you so much for coming.

2
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:18,254
I know it's very tough after a week of GDC and GDC parties, so I appreciate everyone

3
00:00:18,254 --> 00:00:19,655
that's in the room this morning.

4
00:00:20,338 --> 00:00:23,820
I want to welcome to this panel that is kind of virtual.

5
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,301
So it's kind of ironic that we are trying to talk about the metaverse

6
00:00:27,301 --> 00:00:29,402
in a virtual way with you there.

7
00:00:29,402 --> 00:00:33,003
And I want to present the fantastic people that here is with me

8
00:00:33,003 --> 00:00:35,204
and I will allow them to present themselves.

9
00:00:35,204 --> 00:00:38,285
So anyone who wants to start, maybe Andres.

10
00:00:39,387 --> 00:00:45,652
Yes, my name is Sanchez Guadalmos. Unlike what it says there, I'm no longer a senior lecturer

11
00:00:45,652 --> 00:00:50,095
in technical property at the University of Sussex. I've been promoted to reader.

12
00:00:50,095 --> 00:00:56,540
I have no idea what that means other than it's the same salary but a slightly different title.

13
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,162
Sounds impressive.

14
00:00:58,162 --> 00:00:58,682
Exactly.

15
00:00:58,682 --> 00:01:01,004
Sounds impressive.

16
00:01:01,004 --> 00:01:01,184
Avi?

17
00:01:02,782 --> 00:01:10,666
I am Avi Barzev. Nobody knows my company, RealityPrime, because it's a small consulting company.

18
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:17,529
But they do know the projects that I've worked on in the past. So I'll just mention that I

19
00:01:17,529 --> 00:01:23,152
helped start the HoloLens. I worked at Apple. I worked at Amazon on Echo Frames and

20
00:01:23,152 --> 00:01:25,133
I've been working in AR and VR for about 30 years now.

21
00:01:25,133 --> 00:01:26,173
That's amazing. So glad to have you. Dylan?

22
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:30,690
My name is Dylan Orkidi, as is noted on the slide here.

23
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,611
I'm a research engineer slash designer

24
00:01:33,611 --> 00:01:35,352
and a deeply passionate individual

25
00:01:35,352 --> 00:01:37,633
that's been focused on creating realities

26
00:01:37,633 --> 00:01:41,694
and building VR experiences and advancing the technology.

27
00:01:41,694 --> 00:01:47,076
Thanks to the support of the Unity Labs research staff

28
00:01:47,076 --> 00:01:50,878
and my team, my work was recently presented at MetaConnect

29
00:01:50,878 --> 00:01:52,598
and we've got a few new projects

30
00:01:52,598 --> 00:01:54,639
that will be debuted next year.

31
00:01:54,639 --> 00:01:56,480
So I'm just excited to be amongst this.

32
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:02,747
awesome roster here and explore the future. We are so lucky to have you here. And then we have

33
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:09,916
Kurt, another huge name in the digital rights frontier, maybe you say. Thank you, thank you

34
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:14,402
much. Yeah, my name is Kurt Absal, I'm the Deputy Executive Director and General Counsel with the

35
00:02:14,402 --> 00:02:15,643
Electronic Frontier Foundation.

36
00:02:16,072 --> 00:02:22,056
I'm also part of the EFF teams have been working on decentralization and extended reality issues.

37
00:02:22,056 --> 00:02:25,438
You know, if our mission, we're trying to protect and preserve the rights we hold dear

38
00:02:25,438 --> 00:02:28,440
while moving into the future or chart the course for a future

39
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:33,203
where technology will enhance our lives and preserve our human rights.

40
00:02:33,203 --> 00:02:38,226
I have been a deeply admire of the work that EFF has been doing for years.

41
00:02:38,226 --> 00:02:39,347
So it's a pleasure to have you all.

42
00:02:39,347 --> 00:02:43,910
And to start our panel and our discussion, I prepare some.

43
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:50,195
things to put everyone together in like in the same page. I can see hands because we don't have

44
00:02:50,195 --> 00:02:56,780
a camera, but I guess that a lot of you have heard about these words in the past months or the past

45
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:01,564
year. We are building in the metaverse. We are building a metaverse because the industry has

46
00:03:01,564 --> 00:03:06,789
this shift that now everyone is building a metaverse and maybe we don't even know what

47
00:03:06,789 --> 00:03:12,553
it is yet. This of course we know that started with the book, at least the concept and the word.

48
00:03:13,155 --> 00:03:19,716
And then we have a lot of references that are going into pop culture about simulation theory,

49
00:03:19,716 --> 00:03:26,238
about new realities, about virtual realities and how they're portrayed in the pop media,

50
00:03:26,238 --> 00:03:32,999
in the culture. And also, we were saying that we still don't have like a definition of what

51
00:03:32,999 --> 00:03:38,060
the metaverse is, like a consensus on it. Somebody said that it's an embodied internet,

52
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:41,500
other talks about this as the next evolution of the internet.

53
00:03:41,899 --> 00:03:47,984
We are here to discuss that if it is something new or it's just essentially the same internet,

54
00:03:47,984 --> 00:03:51,007
but now in 3D.

55
00:03:51,007 --> 00:03:57,573
Also another thing that everyone is kind of debating these days is which are the defining

56
00:03:57,573 --> 00:03:59,175
characteristics of the metaverse.

57
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:03,693
Because at this point, we are, as we were saying, creating some realities.

58
00:04:03,693 --> 00:04:07,757
And for those, I don't believe that in the audience

59
00:04:07,757 --> 00:04:11,580
that is anyone that hasn't heard about the metaverse, but maybe picture

60
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:15,003
like the good, the good place and how they constructed this reality.

61
00:04:15,003 --> 00:04:20,088
And we want to talk about the ethics of creating this kind of virtual places

62
00:04:20,088 --> 00:04:22,830
and this kind of everything by design places.

63
00:04:23,723 --> 00:04:30,486
Also, we have been reading about the opinions that the industry has on the metaverse and

64
00:04:30,486 --> 00:04:32,567
the technologies around the metaverse.

65
00:04:32,567 --> 00:04:37,448
And this is from the CDC state of the game industry that about one third of the responders

66
00:04:37,448 --> 00:04:40,809
believe that the metaverse will not deliver on this promise.

67
00:04:40,809 --> 00:04:45,251
So we will see if we can or cannot change your mind.

68
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:47,872
Also, we don't agree in the name.

69
00:04:47,872 --> 00:04:51,133
Sometimes it says metaverse.

70
00:04:51,133 --> 00:04:52,013
She's talking about like.

71
00:04:52,495 --> 00:04:56,919
a relationship like websites and the internet.

72
00:04:56,919 --> 00:04:59,320
And also we have big topics to discuss today because.

73
00:04:59,785 --> 00:05:03,728
we are kind of being sold into that there is only one version of the metaverse,

74
00:05:03,728 --> 00:05:07,751
or at least the one that is being presented in the media.

75
00:05:07,751 --> 00:05:10,613
But we are here to talk about big topics like decentralization

76
00:05:10,613 --> 00:05:13,295
and centralization that are kind of two big philosophies

77
00:05:13,295 --> 00:05:19,099
of designing around the Internet and particularly about interoperability,

78
00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:23,382
both technical and legally, and how these these kind of key concepts

79
00:05:23,382 --> 00:05:28,306
influence the metaverse that we will want to have in the future.

80
00:05:28,306 --> 00:05:28,386
So.

81
00:05:28,999 --> 00:05:33,163
Also, we want to talk a bit about wallet gardens.

82
00:05:33,163 --> 00:05:34,684
Maybe you have heard of this.

83
00:05:34,684 --> 00:05:36,906
It's a concept from internet governance.

84
00:05:36,906 --> 00:05:39,848
When we are talking about kind of fragmentations

85
00:05:39,848 --> 00:05:42,010
of the web and the internet,

86
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:45,693
and this is certainly something we don't want to reply

87
00:05:45,693 --> 00:05:46,894
in the metaverse models.

88
00:05:46,894 --> 00:05:49,816
So for those who are as old as I am,

89
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:51,597
you might remember the Truman Show

90
00:05:51,597 --> 00:05:54,200
and the reality of that movie, portraying that movie.

91
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,561
So this is kind of something similar.

92
00:05:57,765 --> 00:06:02,527
And the metaverse will encompass everything in our lives,

93
00:06:02,527 --> 00:06:04,588
or at least is that the promise.

94
00:06:04,588 --> 00:06:09,030
So we need to find ways to create a responsible design

95
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:12,291
that is diverse, accessible, safe, equitable,

96
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:14,072
and overall human rights space.

97
00:06:14,072 --> 00:06:18,294
So this is our three central questions

98
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:19,954
for our panel today.

99
00:06:19,954 --> 00:06:21,835
Who will control the metaverse?

100
00:06:21,835 --> 00:06:24,016
About the revenue models that are we

101
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:26,697
and how they will impact in digital rights?

102
00:06:27,417 --> 00:06:30,858
And what are the governance, ethical, and legal challenges

103
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:32,539
of the metaverse?

104
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:36,940
So for starting the first question about control,

105
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,540
these are our key topics.

106
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:46,643
So who wants to start with these ones?

107
00:06:46,643 --> 00:06:49,623
I'll give it a bit of a go on the first one.

108
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:55,961
but what are the key characteristics that separate the metaverse from the current

109
00:06:55,961 --> 00:07:01,705
internet or virtual worlds. I'm going to assume the mantle of the old man Niels at Cloud,

110
00:07:01,705 --> 00:07:09,270
MIM, and claim that inherently there is no difference. So I would like to start with a

111
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:14,854
bit of the skeptical side. I've been writing and researching on this.

112
00:07:15,713 --> 00:07:18,437
the regulation of the area for a while.

113
00:07:18,437 --> 00:07:21,080
And I've seen various definitions, as you were saying,

114
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:25,126
Mikaela, about what exactly is a metaverse

115
00:07:25,126 --> 00:07:28,190
and other definitions that...

116
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:40,229
I have to say that there is nothing new here, at least for us who lived through the first virtual world's craze around 2006, 2007, maybe even before.

117
00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:52,920
There are repetitions of lots of grandiose claims, and it may seem that the metaverse that we're seeing may depend on who is doing it, on three definitions.

118
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,561
I would say that...

119
00:07:54,925 --> 00:08:04,567
This is potentially going to be a virtual environment that is ruled by platforms,

120
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:09,668
or it's going to be web-3 led, or it's going to be open virtual platforms. So,

121
00:08:09,668 --> 00:08:14,449
whatever the discussion we're going to have, it may depend on what

122
00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:18,970
type of metaverse we're talking about. I know exactly what type of metaverse we're talking about.

123
00:08:19,581 --> 00:08:25,278
we may get different versions of the three of them.

124
00:08:27,064 --> 00:08:30,247
In some ways, this will depend.

125
00:08:30,247 --> 00:08:32,648
The platform metaverse is just a subsidiary

126
00:08:32,648 --> 00:08:34,190
of existing platforms, so it's going

127
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,731
to be pretty much the same.

128
00:08:35,731 --> 00:08:38,493
The Web3 metaverse is going to be a tokenized utopia

129
00:08:38,493 --> 00:08:41,635
of unicorns and rainbows and blockchains,

130
00:08:41,635 --> 00:08:45,558
or the entirely open decentralized metaverse,

131
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:47,700
that it would be very different.

132
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,781
So the last two would definitely be different

133
00:08:49,781 --> 00:08:51,302
from what we have right now.

134
00:08:51,302 --> 00:08:52,543
I hope that makes sense.

135
00:08:55,503 --> 00:08:56,103
Yeah, absolutely.

136
00:08:56,103 --> 00:09:00,266
And I love like the two things like the old man yelling at cloud.

137
00:09:00,266 --> 00:09:02,107
I can't identify with that.

138
00:09:02,107 --> 00:09:05,749
And I also a bit of a skeptical, but I think that for me,

139
00:09:05,749 --> 00:09:08,031
at least the key is interpretability.

140
00:09:08,031 --> 00:09:12,213
When we have that, we can kind of separate the virtual world

141
00:09:12,213 --> 00:09:14,735
from the metaverse.

142
00:09:14,735 --> 00:09:16,216
Who wants to chime in on this?

143
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,422
If I could add something in addition to that,

144
00:09:19,422 --> 00:09:22,305
I think there'll be a very important transition

145
00:09:22,305 --> 00:09:25,247
that can be controlled by entities

146
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:30,732
that might potentially seek to very specifically mandate

147
00:09:30,732 --> 00:09:34,175
APIs that they can copyright and they can control

148
00:09:34,175 --> 00:09:37,638
that could take us away from the current internet paradigm.

149
00:09:38,238 --> 00:09:44,622
and divert us from the promise of Web 3 through that practice.

150
00:09:44,622 --> 00:09:47,524
And I'm seeing whispers of that.

151
00:09:47,524 --> 00:09:52,987
And I do hope that we have enough awareness to make sure that we can navigate around that

152
00:09:52,987 --> 00:09:58,271
and prevent that from allowing the true interoperability and the promise of what it is that I think

153
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,852
that we're seeking with this discussion.

154
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:08,964
Absolutely. That is what I sometimes call legal interoperability,

155
00:10:08,964 --> 00:10:11,584
because to go from one metaverse to another,

156
00:10:11,584 --> 00:10:15,905
if you don't have agreements and contracts that allowed out from a legal standpoint,

157
00:10:15,905 --> 00:10:20,346
you are going to go like a very strict customs that are going to take all your digital goods.

158
00:10:20,346 --> 00:10:26,627
And also you need technical interoperability because you need a technical architecture

159
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:33,068
that allows to portray the object and the functions of the object in another software environment.

160
00:10:33,556 --> 00:10:35,336
So as you were saying for me,

161
00:10:35,336 --> 00:10:38,857
it's something big having interoperability.

162
00:10:38,857 --> 00:10:40,677
Kurt, you were...

163
00:10:40,677 --> 00:10:41,878
Yeah, I wanna-

164
00:10:41,878 --> 00:10:44,338
Putting your hand up for decentralization.

165
00:10:44,338 --> 00:10:46,118
Yeah, I wanna say a few words on decentralization.

166
00:10:46,118 --> 00:10:48,539
Well, first of all, it's sort of re-decentralization.

167
00:10:48,539 --> 00:10:50,579
Like decentralization was a key feature

168
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:52,960
of the early internet where it was a network of networks.

169
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,720
And in some sense,

170
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,400
what you imagine a decentralized metaverse

171
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,621
is sort of a world of worlds where you are a universe,

172
00:10:58,621 --> 00:11:01,281
at least of worlds where you can go around them

173
00:11:01,281 --> 00:11:02,702
in between various ones.

174
00:11:03,468 --> 00:11:08,292
But we've seen the internet has been continually centralized over the last couple of decades.

175
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:12,736
And we've seen some of the problems of that single points of controls and single points of failures.

176
00:11:12,736 --> 00:11:17,080
Now, we'll talk about this a more a bit, but I think a walled garden,

177
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:22,205
it may be attractive to some as it provides additional securities that has an environment

178
00:11:22,205 --> 00:11:26,289
that you might be able to rely on to be in a particular way. But it's still best to have

179
00:11:26,289 --> 00:11:29,491
a choice to be able to move freely between the environments you want to visit.

180
00:11:30,181 --> 00:11:33,102
So we don't want to be locked out or locked in.

181
00:11:33,102 --> 00:11:39,045
So we want to have a decentralized Metaverse that is interoperable and locked open,

182
00:11:39,045 --> 00:11:42,526
resisting attempts to centralize its architecture, its services, its protocols,

183
00:11:42,526 --> 00:11:45,768
and that'll make it more resilient against censorship, surveillance,

184
00:11:45,768 --> 00:11:47,888
and other forms of centralized control.

185
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:50,777
But we can imagine that, that we can build it.

186
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:54,201
But to do that, interoperability will be a key.

187
00:11:54,201 --> 00:11:57,666
You have a consistent avatar that goes with you across platforms,

188
00:11:57,666 --> 00:12:00,309
subject to your control, but not tied to a single provider.

189
00:12:00,309 --> 00:12:02,372
And we will talk about more of these things.

190
00:12:02,372 --> 00:12:05,235
The important thing is we're setting these technologies today,

191
00:12:05,235 --> 00:12:07,618
which are the stage for the technologies of tomorrow.

192
00:12:08,742 --> 00:12:10,583
I wanted to jump in on that point, too.

193
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:13,706
I think that, you know, as Kurt said, that the Internet was designed

194
00:12:13,706 --> 00:12:17,489
to be decentralized for robustness and for freedom.

195
00:12:17,489 --> 00:12:21,833
But we could very easily get back to centralization, even after.

196
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:25,773
re-decentralizing it, we can re-centralize it again.

197
00:12:25,773 --> 00:12:27,334
And one of the things that I see,

198
00:12:27,334 --> 00:12:29,536
one of the dangers I see leading to that

199
00:12:29,536 --> 00:12:32,859
is that people talk about decentralization

200
00:12:32,859 --> 00:12:33,659
like it's a panacea,

201
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:36,041
but what they really want is democratization.

202
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:38,743
And some of the actual technologies

203
00:12:38,743 --> 00:12:40,505
that people are talking about,

204
00:12:40,505 --> 00:12:43,147
especially with Web3, are prone to re-centralization.

205
00:12:43,147 --> 00:12:45,329
There's a lot of discussion now about,

206
00:12:45,329 --> 00:12:46,810
even though blockchain is out there,

207
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:50,092
You go through various centralized providers

208
00:12:50,092 --> 00:12:50,472
to get to it.

209
00:12:50,472 --> 00:12:53,213
And I think one of the most important things to think about

210
00:12:53,213 --> 00:12:55,875
is with DAOs, which I think I love the concept

211
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,656
of trying to build democracy into our structures,

212
00:12:58,656 --> 00:13:00,757
is that when just a slight change

213
00:13:00,757 --> 00:13:03,159
in the way the DAO is built can make a huge difference.

214
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:04,840
If it's one vote per person.

215
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:11,566
that's democracy. If it's one vote per token or per coin or per share, that's a plutocracy.

216
00:13:11,566 --> 00:13:15,850
And plutocracies invariably lead to re-centralization because they're

217
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:20,495
concentrations of wealth. The people who have the wealth have more votes, they can sway,

218
00:13:20,495 --> 00:13:24,298
they can tilt the playing field in their direction without a countervailing force,

219
00:13:24,298 --> 00:13:28,342
and they can get all the coins eventually. And so what we need is systems that

220
00:13:28,562 --> 00:13:34,668
continually re-democratize these things. They don't just do it once, but they keep re-dividing

221
00:13:34,668 --> 00:13:39,853
the pie equally so that we all have a fair say. And I don't see very many DAOs that even think

222
00:13:39,853 --> 00:13:43,496
about that. There's only a few that are thinking about people versus coins.

223
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:50,782
Just a side note on that, for those who are in a DAO that is set up as a plutocracy, as Avi's saying,

224
00:13:50,782 --> 00:13:54,545
where it is done by the amount of tokens you control,

225
00:13:54,545 --> 00:13:57,007
you should look through the history of corporate governance.

226
00:13:57,007 --> 00:13:59,429
That's basically the model of shareholders.

227
00:13:59,429 --> 00:14:03,132
And we have had hundreds of years of issues in corporate governments.

228
00:14:03,132 --> 00:14:06,735
I think there's a lot to be learned about mistakes that were made there

229
00:14:06,735 --> 00:14:10,759
that can be applied to setting up a system that deals with that.

230
00:14:11,628 --> 00:14:14,330
cares about minority shareholder rights,

231
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:15,771
or as Abby says, just go straight

232
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:18,332
to actual democratization, where it is one person, one vote.

233
00:14:18,332 --> 00:14:24,075
Perhaps also a little bit on that.

234
00:14:24,075 --> 00:14:27,237
One of the problems I see with the decentralization

235
00:14:27,237 --> 00:14:31,139
versus centralization debate is that what we are seeing

236
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:37,062
is that it appears like the internet abhors

237
00:14:37,062 --> 00:14:37,982
decentralization.

238
00:14:38,966 --> 00:14:42,529
We created this network for decentralization,

239
00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:44,311
with decentralization in mind,

240
00:14:44,311 --> 00:14:47,373
but it keeps wanting to become centralized.

241
00:14:47,373 --> 00:14:50,475
I think that there are various reasons for this.

242
00:14:50,475 --> 00:14:53,518
There are network theory reasons in which

243
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:56,960
there is the accumulation of links that happens,

244
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,483
and there are architectural reasons for that.

245
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:04,566
And I think that actually decentralization is very difficult.

246
00:15:04,566 --> 00:15:07,969
And my fear, and I'm going to keep playing the skeptic...

247
00:15:08,309 --> 00:15:17,235
My fear is that even if we try to achieve it, the environment that we have right now

248
00:15:17,235 --> 00:15:20,556
is going to move towards centralization.

249
00:15:20,556 --> 00:15:22,738
It's already happening.

250
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,541
depending on the model that we are looking at,

251
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:31,365
all the metaverse, if it's going to be the meta Facebook metaverse,

252
00:15:31,365 --> 00:15:33,927
it's going to be centralized by almost by definition.

253
00:15:33,927 --> 00:15:38,370
So yeah, we have to be careful, but also be aware that sometimes

254
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:42,232
all the best efforts towards decentralization may actually fail

255
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:47,116
because that is the nature of the network.

256
00:15:47,116 --> 00:15:50,318
Sorry, I'm going to be very skeptical.

257
00:15:50,318 --> 00:15:51,178
That's fantastic.

258
00:15:51,802 --> 00:15:55,784
I think that these are real problems that need to be solved.

259
00:15:55,784 --> 00:16:01,448
Some of the advantages of centralization are a single point where you can have a team of

260
00:16:01,448 --> 00:16:07,312
security engineers who are making sure that it is up to date, that they are putting out

261
00:16:07,312 --> 00:16:09,173
patches, improving it.

262
00:16:09,173 --> 00:16:13,296
We have to make sure that if we have a decentralized system, it is also secure.

263
00:16:13,296 --> 00:16:15,418
That requires a bit more work.

264
00:16:15,418 --> 00:16:16,458
I think it's worthwhile.

265
00:16:17,158 --> 00:16:21,943
we will have a better future if there is lots of choice and people can move around and have that.

266
00:16:21,943 --> 00:16:26,867
But it has to be one where they have their rights intact and part of that is having a secure and

267
00:16:26,867 --> 00:16:32,252
private experience that requires a replication of some of these advantages that might become

268
00:16:32,252 --> 00:16:33,653
tempting for centralization.

269
00:16:34,704 --> 00:16:38,007
And that's one of the reasons why I think walled gardens become appealing.

270
00:16:38,007 --> 00:16:42,391
Not that I'm going to argue for walled gardens, but security can definitely be improved.

271
00:16:42,391 --> 00:16:46,135
That's the reason for a gated community, theoretically, is to be able to have

272
00:16:46,135 --> 00:16:48,096
some security as to who comes in and who goes out.

273
00:16:48,096 --> 00:16:51,399
But also, the reason walled gardens exist is because

274
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:53,741
they just may not be enough good content out there yet.

275
00:16:54,022 --> 00:16:58,666
I think initially we should expect walled gardens to happen because it's much more economical

276
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:03,850
to build up your own content first until you get to a certain point. Like we saw with CompuServe and

277
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:08,634
AOL, you get to a certain point because there isn't enough out there that you want that you

278
00:17:08,634 --> 00:17:11,737
feel is good enough, but at a certain point everything else out there becomes way better

279
00:17:11,737 --> 00:17:16,581
than what's inside the walled gardens. And that's when the walls need to come down because people

280
00:17:16,581 --> 00:17:20,905
are going to leave your walled gardens to go out and explore the world when the world becomes richer.

281
00:17:21,746 --> 00:17:24,369
and more interesting than what's within the gardens.

282
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:25,710
And we'll see the same thing here again.

283
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,492
We'll see a whole bunch of walled gardens.

284
00:17:27,492 --> 00:17:29,214
There won't be a lot of reasons

285
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,296
for interconnecting these things together

286
00:17:31,296 --> 00:17:33,038
until people say they want to leave,

287
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:35,420
until people want to go and connect these things

288
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:39,425
and build bridges and build new worlds

289
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:42,188
that are bigger than any individual walled garden maybe.

290
00:17:43,177 --> 00:18:03,208
Absolutely, and if I could piggyback on that, this is where it's so absolutely important to, of course, not only support open source efforts, but even commercial efforts right now that have resisted acquisition by certain corporations to foster those communities and to see where it is that they're choosing to open source certain approaches like

291
00:18:03,309 --> 00:18:23,793
you know, the implementation of WASM and other technologies to be able to make sure that on a platform that say, I don't know, changes the implementation of a standard web browser and prevents others from being able to implement any other browser on that platform that we can still get around that and have just in time compilation to make sure that you can have that interoperable experience.

292
00:18:24,073 --> 00:18:29,916
that goes from platform to platform when you can see the trajectory that is potentially going to

293
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:35,159
lock that out and prevent that situation here. So it's not just about application deployment.

294
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:41,883
It's also about, again, this open flow of the ability for a standard set of APIs and

295
00:18:41,883 --> 00:18:46,405
implementations to be able to go from platform to platform. And we need to be very, very careful and

296
00:18:46,405 --> 00:18:49,927
mindful where we're seeing those gates closed because

297
00:18:50,267 --> 00:18:56,209
To be able to say we support the web is one thing, but to be able to actually support the open web

298
00:18:56,209 --> 00:19:02,192
is a very, very different thing. And we're seeing different walled gardens that are very

299
00:19:02,192 --> 00:19:08,354
beautifully and strategically navigating a process that will prevent that open implementation of,

300
00:19:08,354 --> 00:19:12,675
say, as Kurt mentioned, which is extremely important. An avatar that can bring,

301
00:19:12,675 --> 00:19:17,657
basically within itself, its own operating system, its own set of applications.

302
00:19:18,237 --> 00:19:23,480
et cetera, in between these environments. And we're beginning to get the hints, in my

303
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:28,283
opinion, of the prevention of this. And I think that that's extremely dangerous. And

304
00:19:28,283 --> 00:19:32,025
we need to be very mindful as to how we can prevent that situation.

305
00:19:32,025 --> 00:19:38,829
Absolutely. I think that one of the bad sides of centralization is people get tied to a

306
00:19:38,829 --> 00:19:44,912
system because that's where their content is, that's where their friends are, these

307
00:19:44,912 --> 00:19:47,853
network effects, and it's difficult to move.

308
00:19:48,564 --> 00:19:53,585
And I think, you know, avatars, I think is an example that resonates well because it's

309
00:19:53,585 --> 00:19:58,767
a common thing now that people will spend a lot of time investing in their avatar and

310
00:19:58,767 --> 00:20:02,968
its design, what clothes are being worn, how it interacts.

311
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:07,769
And if they have to go to a different platform, they don't want to do that all over again.

312
00:20:07,769 --> 00:20:09,269
They want to be able to take that.

313
00:20:09,713 --> 00:20:13,716
part of their identity with them. They might have multiple identities that they would put out there,

314
00:20:13,716 --> 00:20:18,360
but they want to be able to interact with people, keeping with them this identity that they've

315
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:22,263
invested in. And the steps that try to prevent that aren't really security and privacy. I think

316
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:27,086
those parts can be handled. It is more trying to get the network effects so that everyone's

317
00:20:27,086 --> 00:20:30,749
on your network and they won't. Right.

318
00:20:32,308 --> 00:20:36,572
I was going to agree that this is something that we already have seen on the internet,

319
00:20:36,572 --> 00:20:42,278
that everyone wants this old quote that if you are not paid for something, you are the product.

320
00:20:42,278 --> 00:20:48,403
This is going to replicate in this because if you have to pay in a metaverse and other metaverse is

321
00:20:48,403 --> 00:20:53,588
going to offer you like avatars and choices to create this content, you're going to prefer that.

322
00:20:53,989 --> 00:20:56,530
So for me, that's a delicate balance

323
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:57,952
that we are going to have to strike

324
00:20:57,952 --> 00:21:00,934
because at the same time, one of the revenue models,

325
00:21:00,934 --> 00:21:03,456
and we are going to talk a bit about this,

326
00:21:03,456 --> 00:21:06,378
is profiting from content.

327
00:21:06,378 --> 00:21:10,181
So I think like to kind of quote this part of the discussion

328
00:21:10,181 --> 00:21:12,743
is like decentralization is very tied

329
00:21:12,743 --> 00:21:15,805
to the revenue models that we're going to see maybe.

330
00:21:15,805 --> 00:21:17,627
So that was my two cents.

331
00:21:17,627 --> 00:21:18,788
Avi, please go.

332
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:26,000
Yeah, maybe this will help close the section a little bit, but what we need to do for the

333
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,885
so-called metaverse is very much like what happened with the web. We need the ability to link

334
00:21:29,885 --> 00:21:35,253
between different spaces so that we can point to other spaces and create semantic models between

335
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:35,434
them.

336
00:21:35,854 --> 00:21:39,615
We need portals, but portals actually are like iframes. If you look at browser technology,

337
00:21:39,615 --> 00:21:45,397
they need to be implemented as a sandbox because you don't want a doorway to another world being

338
00:21:45,397 --> 00:21:50,818
able to either steal information or impose and create an attack surface. So you want to sandbox

339
00:21:50,818 --> 00:21:54,239
it and isolate it in the way the iframes were meant to do. They didn't work perfectly, but

340
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:56,541
they were meant to do this.

341
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:59,845
And we ultimately will be creating a web,

342
00:21:59,845 --> 00:22:02,247
just essentially like the web that we see in 2D,

343
00:22:02,247 --> 00:22:05,030
but a web of all these spaces together

344
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,612
that make the greater space.

345
00:22:06,612 --> 00:22:10,056
And it's less about, can I bring my middle earth?

346
00:22:10,296 --> 00:22:14,358
fighter dwarf, you know, with plus one verbal sword into a science fiction battle.

347
00:22:14,358 --> 00:22:16,579
That doesn't make sense semantically.

348
00:22:16,579 --> 00:22:19,341
And the designers of each of those spaces don't want that to happen.

349
00:22:19,341 --> 00:22:20,962
But that's not the point.

350
00:22:20,962 --> 00:22:23,923
The point is that I have the freedom, as Kurt said, to have the freedom

351
00:22:23,923 --> 00:22:29,686
to take what I've done and not be tied to a platform that isn't working in my favor.

352
00:22:29,686 --> 00:22:32,508
And just like we did with phone numbers, we want portability.

353
00:22:32,508 --> 00:22:35,870
We want the ability to say, screw you, AT&T, I'm going over here.

354
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:38,470
And that's it. Once we have that, we have the ability,

355
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:41,351
we have more power and more control over our destiny

356
00:22:41,351 --> 00:22:42,952
once we have that.

357
00:22:42,952 --> 00:22:44,993
Absolutely. Nobody's going to separate myself

358
00:22:44,993 --> 00:22:46,593
from my virtual pet companion.

359
00:22:46,593 --> 00:22:48,334
I'm going to tell you that.

360
00:22:48,334 --> 00:22:51,355
No meta, no everyone.

361
00:22:51,355 --> 00:22:55,096
Let's move a bit for the revenue models of the metaverse.

362
00:22:55,096 --> 00:22:57,777
So, we're going to have like a lot of memes

363
00:22:57,777 --> 00:22:59,737
because everyone here is kind of a geek.

364
00:23:00,781 --> 00:23:08,129
So we have also seen the respondents of the GDC state of the game industry, that is a huge backlash

365
00:23:08,129 --> 00:23:15,898
against NFTs and against cryptocurrencies and implementing these in games. But in the people's

366
00:23:15,898 --> 00:23:22,065
eye, metaverses are kind of very related to gaming or are very kind of close to gaming.

367
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:26,080
The sentiment is strong about NFTs,

368
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,461
and I really love this one.

369
00:23:28,461 --> 00:23:31,122
I'd rather not endorse burning a rainforest down

370
00:23:31,122 --> 00:23:34,664
to confirm that someone else owns a GPG.

371
00:23:34,664 --> 00:23:37,526
So my questions for you is like,

372
00:23:37,526 --> 00:23:41,748
taking on this possible models of revenue for the metaverse

373
00:23:41,748 --> 00:23:47,111
by seeing content and data collection on content creation,

374
00:23:47,111 --> 00:23:48,412
what can we expect to see?

375
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:55,032
As the lawyer, I guess I can give it a start again.

376
00:23:55,032 --> 00:24:02,137
Sorry to sound like a broken record, but it may depend really on the model that is going

377
00:24:02,137 --> 00:24:06,360
to be adopted in the platform metaverse, let's say your meta metaverse.

378
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:08,629
all ownership will go to the platform.

379
00:24:08,629 --> 00:24:11,471
And I'm expecting that this is going to be,

380
00:24:11,471 --> 00:24:13,132
this is already what happens.

381
00:24:13,132 --> 00:24:15,494
You don't own your content, you are licensed.

382
00:24:15,494 --> 00:24:17,555
You receive a license that allows you

383
00:24:17,555 --> 00:24:19,056
to operate in that space.

384
00:24:19,056 --> 00:24:20,977
You don't own your virtual property.

385
00:24:20,977 --> 00:24:23,399
All of that is owned by the platform.

386
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:31,988
by the developer, the company that operates the space. The idea, I think, of the appeal of the

387
00:24:31,988 --> 00:24:37,973
Web3 idea of the metaverse is that the ownership is going to be tied with tokens and possibly with

388
00:24:37,973 --> 00:24:42,977
NFTs, even though there is, as you were saying, Michaela, very rightly, a big pushback against

389
00:24:42,977 --> 00:24:49,182
this. And I think that this idea is that the smart contracts are going to mediate the scheme.

390
00:24:49,767 --> 00:24:55,631
The problem with that is, obviously, there is nothing that ties a token with the ownership

391
00:24:55,631 --> 00:25:04,036
of the item, of the asset. So you may have a token, but you may claim or it may link you to

392
00:25:04,036 --> 00:25:11,521
something, but there's nothing legal that says that that asset is yours just because you own

393
00:25:11,521 --> 00:25:17,965
that token. We would have to build in a system of recognition of the ownership of tokens.

394
00:25:19,112 --> 00:25:22,956
I'm afraid that it probably would make things very difficult, very clunky.

395
00:25:22,956 --> 00:25:26,641
If anyone has tried to use the central land, I have tried.

396
00:25:26,641 --> 00:25:29,344
I found it extremely slow and clunky, personally.

397
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:31,206
The third model would be.

398
00:25:31,642 --> 00:25:38,224
to have something more open, something akin to what Second Life was doing back in the early days.

399
00:25:38,224 --> 00:25:44,805
I don't know if people are familiar with that. You would pretty much own everything that you

400
00:25:44,805 --> 00:25:49,226
created and you would be able to get a CC license from that. So it was still sort of

401
00:25:49,226 --> 00:25:57,288
owned in some ways by the platform, but you'd be getting a very strong copyright ownership claim.

402
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:02,222
Those are the three models I think are possibly emerging.

403
00:26:03,544 --> 00:26:09,508
I worked on Second Life and I don't take any credit for the ecosystem stuff that Philip

404
00:26:09,508 --> 00:26:11,469
Rosedale really spearheaded.

405
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:16,053
He brought in actual economists and did a really great job of trying to create a virtual

406
00:26:16,053 --> 00:26:21,677
economy that could thrive, that didn't suffer from inflation or deflation.

407
00:26:21,677 --> 00:26:27,101
And I think it's worth mentioning that a lot of these models that we're seeing emerge now

408
00:26:27,101 --> 00:26:29,423
are based on this idea of artificial scarcity.

409
00:26:29,643 --> 00:26:31,505
which is inherently deflationary.

410
00:26:31,505 --> 00:26:34,608
The whole idea of buying an NFT today

411
00:26:34,608 --> 00:26:37,151
in the hope that it's going to triple

412
00:26:37,151 --> 00:26:39,333
or 10x in value or go to the moon

413
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:40,494
is inherently deflationary.

414
00:26:40,494 --> 00:26:42,957
It causes people to buy things and hoard them.

415
00:26:42,957 --> 00:26:45,319
What we really want is a model of abundance.

416
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:46,301
And Second Life had that.

417
00:26:46,301 --> 00:26:48,403
It had the ability to copy things really easily.

418
00:26:48,403 --> 00:26:49,764
And people made money.

419
00:26:49,764 --> 00:26:50,705
People, in fact, made...

420
00:26:51,186 --> 00:26:54,648
made more money per person than they do today

421
00:26:54,648 --> 00:26:56,569
off of a lot of these other systems,

422
00:26:56,569 --> 00:26:59,431
including Roblox and other UGC systems.

423
00:26:59,431 --> 00:27:03,994
And not only that, but the company made more money per person

424
00:27:03,994 --> 00:27:06,975
than the companies today like Google and Facebook do

425
00:27:06,975 --> 00:27:07,956
off of advertising models.

426
00:27:07,956 --> 00:27:09,337
So it was actually, it didn't scale

427
00:27:09,337 --> 00:27:10,858
because there were only millions of people.

428
00:27:10,858 --> 00:27:13,179
There weren't hundreds of millions of people,

429
00:27:13,179 --> 00:27:14,420
but it was a good model, still is.

430
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,625
And there's a lot to learn from it.

431
00:27:16,625 --> 00:27:19,673
And I think a lot of people in this space just ignore that

432
00:27:19,673 --> 00:27:21,858
and start over and say, well, we should just do this.

433
00:27:21,858 --> 00:27:24,184
And what we're doing instead is,

434
00:27:24,972 --> 00:27:31,214
relying on this craziness of artificial scarcity. The whole point of it was abundance, was that

435
00:27:31,214 --> 00:27:37,736
things are now easy to copy and we should be reveling in that superpower of being able to

436
00:27:37,736 --> 00:27:42,877
create infinite numbers of things and not trying to impose these limits of scarcity in order just

437
00:27:42,877 --> 00:27:46,639
for some people to make money. Because clearly not everybody can make money that way. It's

438
00:27:46,639 --> 00:27:50,820
impossible that we can all succeed. So let's come up with a better model that we can actually all

439
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:51,360
succeed at.

440
00:27:52,547 --> 00:27:58,693
As a Star Trek fan, I support that wholeheartedly because I think about the replicators and

441
00:27:58,693 --> 00:28:04,639
the thing that we could replicate everything at all kind of zero marginal cost.

442
00:28:04,639 --> 00:28:08,563
And we are trying to do the opposite here because we are trying to create artificial

443
00:28:08,563 --> 00:28:14,629
scarcity and close, as you were saying, something that is inherently possible in the digital

444
00:28:14,629 --> 00:28:15,490
world.

445
00:28:16,735 --> 00:28:22,037
Another interesting thing is like you were talking about second life revenue models and what we are

446
00:28:22,037 --> 00:28:28,100
seeing in the platforms that today deal with user-generated content is like the opposite

447
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:35,403
model. It's like taking what people create in those platforms and trying to appropriate that.

448
00:28:35,403 --> 00:28:40,206
And I think as you were saying, this is going to suffocate the creativity that we need in the

449
00:28:40,206 --> 00:28:40,686
metaverse.

450
00:28:41,987 --> 00:28:44,269
There was a meme that went around for a while,

451
00:28:44,269 --> 00:28:46,431
that you wouldn't download a car.

452
00:28:46,431 --> 00:28:48,893
It was like a campaign against downloading music.

453
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:51,676
And of course you would download a car.

454
00:28:51,676 --> 00:28:54,598
And now in a metaverse, you can download a car.

455
00:28:54,598 --> 00:28:56,300
But I think we can take some lessons from that,

456
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,821
is that I guess people do want to have that.

457
00:28:57,821 --> 00:29:00,563
They want to have a car that they can download.

458
00:29:00,563 --> 00:29:04,186
And if you make it a reasonable fee, a convenience fee,

459
00:29:04,186 --> 00:29:07,289
or you pay a subscription and you get some assets

460
00:29:07,289 --> 00:29:07,910
to do things.

461
00:29:08,852 --> 00:29:12,755
There's a revenue model there. But if it's a revenue model that's trying to make it so that

462
00:29:12,755 --> 00:29:18,979
you have to pay for your downloaded car something akin to what you would pay for a real life car,

463
00:29:18,979 --> 00:29:22,982
you've got a few people to do that. But that's not creating a better world.

464
00:29:22,982 --> 00:29:27,565
They're trying to replicate, as I was saying, replicate the scarcity of our world.

465
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:35,010
And one of the challenging things that there was is the internet has basically zero cost for copying.

466
00:29:35,949 --> 00:29:41,310
And a lot of our old world revenue models are based on it costs money to buy the materials,

467
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:45,071
put them together, get them to a store, ship them to your house or whatever,

468
00:29:45,071 --> 00:29:48,332
all of these costs. And the internet makes those costs low.

469
00:29:48,332 --> 00:29:54,333
And so the good world that comes out of that is that the creators and innovators behind it can

470
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:58,774
get a larger chunk of their revenues than they currently get, and people will be paying less.

471
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:06,612
What? And the right-click mentality is out there, absolutely. And that's also something that people

472
00:30:06,612 --> 00:30:12,114
have to realize when they're getting involved in an NFT. You really understand what it is.

473
00:30:12,114 --> 00:30:18,535
It's a notation on a blockchain that says something often pointing to a URL. It is not a copyright

474
00:30:18,535 --> 00:30:24,157
in what it is on that URL. You do not get any rights transferred to it. You get a notation

475
00:30:24,157 --> 00:30:24,777
on a blockchain.

476
00:30:25,274 --> 00:30:30,139
Now, sometimes that is a cool notation. It's the only one of that. It's like getting an artist to

477
00:30:30,139 --> 00:30:34,184
sign something. If it's the original artist and they give you an NFT of a piece of artwork,

478
00:30:34,184 --> 00:30:38,889
that might be similar to a physical signature on a piece of artwork that you buy in an art gallery.

479
00:30:38,889 --> 00:30:44,375
But if you're thinking you're getting ownership in any traditional sense, like a legal sense,

480
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:46,297
that doesn't happen inherently from an NFT.

481
00:30:48,714 --> 00:31:01,654
My question is, because I'm going to take advantage that there are a few lawyers in the room and IP lawyers and copyright lawyers for the worst, to ask this, is there any way you think that we can have ownership attached to an NFT?

482
00:31:02,394 --> 00:31:09,482
we can create this setting in which we can transfer copyright through NFT.

483
00:31:09,482 --> 00:31:15,209
Andres and I, we were talking a lot about this on Twitter because we all seen what

484
00:31:15,209 --> 00:31:19,714
happens with SpiceDAO and their confusion about copyright and what...

485
00:31:20,554 --> 00:31:23,296
at the acquisition of a book if they can,

486
00:31:23,296 --> 00:31:26,519
what they can and can't do with copyright.

487
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:29,801
And there is this thing that is very confusing for people,

488
00:31:29,801 --> 00:31:32,283
like actually owning an object

489
00:31:32,283 --> 00:31:35,084
and having the digital rights, sorry,

490
00:31:35,084 --> 00:31:37,246
the rights, the intellectual property rights

491
00:31:37,246 --> 00:31:38,467
that go with that.

492
00:31:38,467 --> 00:31:40,868
So do you think that we can technically solve this

493
00:31:40,868 --> 00:31:45,331
to have, technically from the legal perspective,

494
00:31:45,331 --> 00:31:49,014
solve this to have two ownership attached to an NFT?

495
00:31:49,903 --> 00:31:51,885
Well, go ahead, Kurt.

496
00:31:51,885 --> 00:31:57,011
I was going to say, from a U.S. copyright law perspective,

497
00:31:57,011 --> 00:32:00,394
you basically have a copyright registration system

498
00:32:00,394 --> 00:32:02,997
in order to file a lawsuit to enforce your IP rights.

499
00:32:02,997 --> 00:32:09,044
You need to register the copyright with the Copyright Office.

500
00:32:09,044 --> 00:32:09,484
You could.

501
00:32:10,043 --> 00:32:14,612
Imagine a system in which you are registering that instead of with the copyright office,

502
00:32:14,612 --> 00:32:16,255
registering that on a blockchain,

503
00:32:16,255 --> 00:32:20,965
because that is an instance in which you want a permanent record that's featured in the blockchain hat.

504
00:32:21,494 --> 00:32:31,403
But it would have to be like a better system than the registration system with the copyright office, which could probably be improved, but it's actually a pretty simple and cheap system to use.

505
00:32:31,403 --> 00:32:33,485
And it's the only one that is enforced by law.

506
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:42,514
So if you have an NFT that says this copyright belongs to you and you try and then sue over it, it doesn't matter unless you also have a copyright restriction.

507
00:32:45,061 --> 00:33:06,149
Yes. In other countries, we don't have a registration system. So in some ways, it could be both easier and more difficult because the transfer of copyright then it has to have certain types of formalities in the UK, for example, it needs to be the transfer of copyright has to be in writing and signed.

508
00:33:06,826 --> 00:33:10,369
I think that you could possibly argue that the signature,

509
00:33:10,369 --> 00:33:14,433
you can use something like your wallet to sign something,

510
00:33:14,433 --> 00:33:16,955
that could be acceptable,

511
00:33:16,955 --> 00:33:20,118
but I cannot see an NFT or a smart contract

512
00:33:20,118 --> 00:33:22,500
fulfilling the requirements in writing.

513
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:28,705
I cannot see this working, at least on the current framework.

514
00:33:28,705 --> 00:33:36,775
The only way I can imagine potentially using NFTs is to create a new format in which you can build

515
00:33:36,775 --> 00:33:42,061
in sort of a dumb contract into the system in which

516
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:49,053
the NFT links or contains also in the smart contract,

517
00:33:49,053 --> 00:33:50,394
a transfer of ownership.

518
00:33:50,394 --> 00:33:52,215
That is the only system that I can see,

519
00:33:52,215 --> 00:33:56,237
but you need to change the current standards that you have.

520
00:33:56,237 --> 00:34:00,259
So it is possible, or it's also possible to have ownership

521
00:34:00,259 --> 00:34:03,481
or transfer ownership of on-chain items,

522
00:34:03,481 --> 00:34:06,823
items that exist only on the blockchain,

523
00:34:06,823 --> 00:34:10,505
but those are extremely rare and very expensive.

524
00:34:11,145 --> 00:34:14,467
there is a cost that goes into uploading information

525
00:34:14,467 --> 00:34:15,648
into the blockchain.

526
00:34:15,648 --> 00:34:18,930
So I can see it right now, it's not possible.

527
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:21,752
It's potentially viable.

528
00:34:21,752 --> 00:34:27,936
I think that you can probably build hacks around this,

529
00:34:27,936 --> 00:34:31,698
have a normal contract accompanying

530
00:34:31,698 --> 00:34:35,660
the creation of an NFT, et cetera, et cetera.

531
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,802
But right now in the system as it stands,

532
00:34:37,802 --> 00:34:40,723
it's very unlikely that you'll be able to manage that.

533
00:34:41,607 --> 00:34:44,008
If I could add something in the intersection

534
00:34:44,008 --> 00:34:48,070
in between revenue models and say copyright,

535
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:51,492
given the topic, I'm personally working on

536
00:34:51,492 --> 00:34:53,653
and I'm working with a number of other individuals

537
00:34:53,653 --> 00:34:56,994
that are working on a sort of inversion model with NFTs,

538
00:34:56,994 --> 00:34:59,776
where you have an experiential economy

539
00:34:59,776 --> 00:35:03,438
that creates an NFT that lets, for example,

540
00:35:03,438 --> 00:35:06,319
say it's an application or a virtual reality experience.

541
00:35:06,619 --> 00:35:13,021
And the participants that spend time in that experience are both investing some type of

542
00:35:13,021 --> 00:35:17,523
currency at that point, but potentially also accruing a localized currency within that

543
00:35:17,523 --> 00:35:23,645
specific NFT. And at that point, I can at least speak to the projects I'm working on.

544
00:35:23,945 --> 00:35:28,807
the individual that spends that time there is also able to sculpt and reshape that NFT

545
00:35:28,807 --> 00:35:37,811
in sort of a remixed form that will go with any exchange of that NFT to another owner at that

546
00:35:37,811 --> 00:35:42,433
point. So I think that we need a new concept of copyright in the sense that it needs to be

547
00:35:42,433 --> 00:35:44,433
far more dynamic, far more agile.

548
00:35:44,954 --> 00:35:50,395
And that that individual that, let's say, you buy my NFT, you shape that experience

549
00:35:50,395 --> 00:35:55,437
and remix it into your own form, someone else spends 1000 human hours in there,

550
00:35:55,437 --> 00:36:00,359
they've accrued a different set of value, there needs to be this attribution financially and say,

551
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:04,160
copyright wise, whatever, something that can be legally defended, I think is what we're coming

552
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:08,041
down to. Because that's really all that matters here. Otherwise, you're just making the claim,

553
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:13,283
there needs to be something that as it transfers from owner to owner that we accrue this

554
00:36:13,643 --> 00:36:19,605
this value that carries itself amongst user to user to user, buyer to buyer to buyer,

555
00:36:19,605 --> 00:36:24,226
and is automatically attributed to anyone that played that role in that process there.

556
00:36:24,226 --> 00:36:30,648
I'm not seeing that in the legal spectrum right now, but it's coming. The next generation of

557
00:36:30,648 --> 00:36:36,189
NFTs will not just be JPEGs. They will be experiences that approve value based on

558
00:36:36,189 --> 00:36:41,410
individuals that spend time in there at a certain point. And I think we need to prepare for that.

559
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:43,371
I don't think we are at this point.

560
00:36:44,234 --> 00:36:46,136
I'd like to see a radically different system.

561
00:36:46,136 --> 00:36:48,940
And a lot of what you said resonates with me,

562
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,663
but I think, you know, and I don't call myself

563
00:36:50,663 --> 00:36:52,525
a game developer because I've never shipped a game title.

564
00:36:52,525 --> 00:36:55,349
Second Life is probably the closest that I came to that,

565
00:36:55,349 --> 00:36:57,172
but I think I know enough game developers to say it.

566
00:36:57,172 --> 00:37:00,156
I think the game development community has been very open.

567
00:37:00,457 --> 00:37:05,920
about ideas. The whole idea has been, you know, to create a genre of games and people riff off

568
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:10,203
the same ideas and of course people make money at it, but it's been a very open community,

569
00:37:10,203 --> 00:37:16,727
very anti-IP protection and things like that and I love that about it and I think that.

570
00:37:17,007 --> 00:37:20,848
What we could imagine is a world in which we don't worry so much about ownership,

571
00:37:20,848 --> 00:37:27,210
and we don't even worry so much about copying, but we worry about giving credit to who created ideas.

572
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:31,512
We focus on the creators of the idea, which I think copyright law seems to be meant to do.

573
00:37:31,512 --> 00:37:34,473
The idea that even before I register with the Copyright Office,

574
00:37:34,473 --> 00:37:37,554
just publishing something implicitly gives me some protections.

575
00:37:37,554 --> 00:37:42,536
I can waive some of those with Creative Commons, but I get a lot of protections

576
00:37:42,536 --> 00:37:44,997
just by putting my own content out there in public.

577
00:37:44,997 --> 00:37:45,897
I think that's important.

578
00:37:46,422 --> 00:37:53,329
I think the idea could be if we could just do a better job of keeping track of who came up with what ideas and then who modified which idea.

579
00:37:53,329 --> 00:37:56,472
So what is the authorship chain of ideas?

580
00:37:56,472 --> 00:38:01,557
So I take something that Michaela said or wrote or painted or whatever and improve it.

581
00:38:01,557 --> 00:38:06,882
Can we measure the value added by me and the value added by the next person in the chain?

582
00:38:06,882 --> 00:38:08,623
And then if way down the chain.

583
00:38:08,883 --> 00:38:13,585
it makes money, great. The money can flow back through the chain. And if it doesn't make money,

584
00:38:13,585 --> 00:38:17,906
that's okay too, because the credit, the authorship credit can flow back through the chain. So if

585
00:38:17,906 --> 00:38:23,387
somebody makes a completely free game or movie, they can at least list the credits of who contributed

586
00:38:23,387 --> 00:38:28,329
to it. And so we worry less about what's in my wallet and worry more about what's in my history,

587
00:38:28,329 --> 00:38:31,670
what's in my CV, how did we each use each other's work.

588
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:37,553
And that's what I mean by abundance, because in a world like that, it encourages us to put our ideas out there,

589
00:38:37,553 --> 00:38:41,876
essentially for free, in the hope that someone else will use them and improve them and make them better,

590
00:38:41,876 --> 00:38:44,998
and build a richer world from that without worrying so much about,

591
00:38:44,998 --> 00:38:47,639
can I get money for this thing on day one?

592
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:49,841
I don't want to worry about that. I want to worry about creating.

593
00:38:49,841 --> 00:38:52,242
I want to make things and put them out there and see them grow.

594
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:54,913
I absolutely agree with that.

595
00:38:54,913 --> 00:38:58,778
And also, I did some research in something that is kind of technical

596
00:38:58,778 --> 00:39:03,143
or copyright, but it's called the negative areas of intellectual property.

597
00:39:03,143 --> 00:39:07,808
And I totally agree that the video game industry was as a whole

598
00:39:07,808 --> 00:39:11,753
a lot of permissive on the uses of video games.

599
00:39:11,753 --> 00:39:14,436
And thanks to that, we have streaming and we have esports.

600
00:39:14,756 --> 00:39:18,519
as two version in industry that were built on top of video games.

601
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:22,282
And also we have seen that there are alternative revenue models

602
00:39:22,282 --> 00:39:26,785
that can work because sharing content is the model of the social networks.

603
00:39:26,785 --> 00:39:28,327
TikTok has this model.

604
00:39:28,327 --> 00:39:31,329
It's not doesn't matter who kind of

605
00:39:31,329 --> 00:39:31,629
kind of.

606
00:39:33,145 --> 00:39:40,936
is copying it, but it doesn't matter who created it. And it also, who added the value along the

607
00:39:40,936 --> 00:39:44,782
chain. And also we are living in a culture that kind of...

608
00:39:45,788 --> 00:39:50,952
glorifies repetition because we are seeing these trends of people doing the same dances,

609
00:39:50,952 --> 00:39:55,114
which in the eyes of a copyright lawyer might be an aberration.

610
00:39:55,114 --> 00:40:00,178
But this is the society we are living in and how people choose to consume content.

611
00:40:00,178 --> 00:40:04,761
So I totally see that that the video game industry can spearhead

612
00:40:04,761 --> 00:40:11,885
this kind of change into other areas of of video of copyright.

613
00:40:11,885 --> 00:40:12,726
Is it now?

614
00:40:13,672 --> 00:40:15,373
Yeah, as you mentioned, TikTok.

615
00:40:15,373 --> 00:40:18,476
One of the things I think has been really impressive about TikTok is this

616
00:40:18,476 --> 00:40:22,498
where someone will sing a song and then someone will present a their TikTok,

617
00:40:22,498 --> 00:40:25,200
which is a duet with the first song, and then someone else will come on

618
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,501
to harmonize with that.

619
00:40:26,501 --> 00:40:29,523
And each one is making the song sort of a richer and deeper experience.

620
00:40:29,523 --> 00:40:31,785
I think that's sort of what you're talking about.

621
00:40:31,785 --> 00:40:35,447
And, you know, it's done singing on TikTok is to maybe done with dancing as well.

622
00:40:35,447 --> 00:40:38,590
But you can you can apply that theory, I think, to video games,

623
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:41,272
to all other forms of content, each one build on.

624
00:40:43,963 --> 00:40:49,645
Absolutely. And let's go to the elephant in the room, the big challenges ahead.

625
00:40:49,645 --> 00:40:56,208
We know that we all love cats, so I included this talking about how we are distracted by 3D

626
00:40:56,208 --> 00:41:00,890
virtual cats while humanity in the metaverse is kind of caught in fire.

627
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:07,472
So our questions for ending this panel today are these that by no means are easy.

628
00:41:08,197 --> 00:41:12,238
What are the legal and ethical challenges that you foresee ahead?

629
00:41:12,238 --> 00:41:15,440
And what kind of are like the more urgent red flags

630
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:23,263
that we need to be paying attention to?

631
00:41:23,263 --> 00:41:26,304
Well, I guess one of the challenges with any kind of virtual reality

632
00:41:26,304 --> 00:41:29,566
universe in which you are projecting yourself into that universe

633
00:41:29,566 --> 00:41:32,047
is in order to do that projection,

634
00:41:32,047 --> 00:41:34,988
your device has to get a whole bunch of information about you.

635
00:41:35,651 --> 00:41:41,676
And in some versions of this, you know, it's just your voice and a relatively robotic avatar.

636
00:41:41,676 --> 00:41:46,099
Some visions, your hands will be moving in time with your hands, your facial expression

637
00:41:46,099 --> 00:41:50,402
will be sent, and we'll have a much richer experience from the person you're interacting

638
00:41:50,402 --> 00:41:51,243
with.

639
00:41:51,243 --> 00:41:56,787
But all that data about everything you do is now being digitized and transmitted to

640
00:41:56,787 --> 00:41:59,349
another service so it can be rendered for the other party.

641
00:42:00,189 --> 00:42:04,630
but all of that is a tremendous amount of information about you for which people can draw

642
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:15,092
inferences, use those to advertise, to convince you of things, maybe not in traditional advertising.

643
00:42:15,092 --> 00:42:21,634
And you were mentioning the Truman Show earlier, which is an example of sort of a, you know,

644
00:42:21,634 --> 00:42:28,575
very dystopia of a world. It was not a virtual world in the modern sense, but it was basically

645
00:42:28,575 --> 00:42:29,475
a world in which

646
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:34,965
all the interactions were being shown to one person that were being acted, that were being

647
00:42:34,965 --> 00:42:41,492
betrayed to create a universe designed for them but designed to control them. And that is something

648
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:47,138
that is possible in a virtual reality where all the things around you that you're seeing

649
00:42:47,138 --> 00:42:50,862
are designed to give you an impression and leave you with a set of...

650
00:42:51,433 --> 00:42:55,896
desires that fit other people's interests and not your own.

651
00:42:55,896 --> 00:42:58,098
And so that's one of the risks that we have to address

652
00:42:58,098 --> 00:43:00,660
and make sure that we have the power,

653
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:02,481
that the users have the power,

654
00:43:02,481 --> 00:43:05,543
that people are able to keep their rights with them.

655
00:43:05,543 --> 00:43:08,445
So this is an, I absolutely agree with that.

656
00:43:08,445 --> 00:43:10,487
And I would say this is, of course,

657
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:12,128
given the slide and the topic here,

658
00:43:12,128 --> 00:43:14,430
absolutely important topic.

659
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:16,892
I strongly feel that we need to approach

660
00:43:16,892 --> 00:43:19,654
an environment technologically where we give

661
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:26,733
zero trust to corporate entities. We give zero trust to governmental entities. And this needs

662
00:43:26,733 --> 00:43:31,275
to happen with the implementation of zero knowledge proofs. This has to happen with

663
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:37,138
the implementation of homomorphic encryption. For example, in the case of FaceID, FaceID can

664
00:43:37,138 --> 00:43:41,280
be done right now with private biometrics. Those aren't just two words. That is a very specific

665
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,742
technology that uses homomorphic encryption to make sure that not only is it more bandwidth

666
00:43:45,742 --> 00:43:47,743
efficient and computationally efficient.

667
00:43:47,903 --> 00:43:52,665
But there is no storage of the original image that was captured on device.

668
00:43:52,665 --> 00:43:56,246
Any company that tells you that they're protecting your privacy,

669
00:43:56,246 --> 00:43:59,187
for example, with something like face ID and they're not implementing

670
00:43:59,187 --> 00:44:02,689
private biometrics is the specific example of what I'm speaking of.

671
00:44:02,689 --> 00:44:04,189
This needs to be codified into law.

672
00:44:04,189 --> 00:44:07,950
This is one of the reasons why I'm one of the backers, major backers

673
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:10,471
of the XR Safety Initiative and a number of other groups

674
00:44:10,471 --> 00:44:15,233
that are aware of this, and they understand that what what Kurt mentioned there.

675
00:44:15,353 --> 00:44:21,315
cannot occur as technology goes from the HMD, which is still external, to whatever will eventually be

676
00:44:21,315 --> 00:44:28,217
implanted within us if we accept that. We must make sure that computation occurs without decryption.

677
00:44:28,217 --> 00:44:33,739
Encryption must occur and it must be mandated for anything that will actually be evaluating

678
00:44:33,739 --> 00:44:40,301
anything that we express externally or internally. I've already proven demonstrations with

679
00:44:40,301 --> 00:44:41,161
multiple HMD devices.

680
00:44:41,581 --> 00:44:47,163
that demonstrate that we don't need, for example, as Kirk mentioned, in a social scenario with

681
00:44:47,163 --> 00:44:52,406
interaction from one user to another, that never needs to be decrypted from device to device.

682
00:44:52,406 --> 00:44:57,388
There is no provider that actually needs to hold that data in a raw form. And for as long as we

683
00:44:57,388 --> 00:45:03,351
don't fight to make sure that we're protecting that constant encryption in between those stages,

684
00:45:03,611 --> 00:45:09,557
then we open ourselves up to any form of manipulation of our consciousness that we probably, some

685
00:45:09,557 --> 00:45:13,481
people may want it, but we probably don't want in the longer term and more importantly,

686
00:45:13,481 --> 00:45:17,124
we wouldn't want to imbue upon the next generations downward.

687
00:45:17,124 --> 00:45:22,569
We need to begin a trend of understanding that we can have pure computation on encrypted

688
00:45:22,569 --> 00:45:27,254
data that is never decrypted and as for as long as we want to build a million arguments

689
00:45:27,254 --> 00:45:28,015
around that.

690
00:45:28,055 --> 00:45:31,997
then we open ourselves up to exactly what I think that this slide is about,

691
00:45:31,997 --> 00:45:34,119
what it was that Kurt mentioned here.

692
00:45:34,119 --> 00:45:36,260
And any other discussion around that is great,

693
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:39,362
but it has nothing to do with the fact that right now today,

694
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:42,965
we can make sure that computation can occur on encrypted data

695
00:45:42,965 --> 00:45:45,306
that is never decrypted from client to client.

696
00:45:45,306 --> 00:45:48,088
And when we talk about interoperable metaverses,

697
00:45:48,088 --> 00:45:51,350
in what scenario would we want anyone to be able to have,

698
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:54,873
any third-party entity to have any understanding of what's happening there?

699
00:45:55,253 --> 00:46:01,377
when right now today we can implement infrastructure that makes sure that we still have that same

700
00:46:01,377 --> 00:46:04,559
interoperable experience and nothing is decrypted.

701
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:07,661
Everything else is negated in my opinion. Part of my strong feelings here.

702
00:46:08,372 --> 00:46:09,953
I totally agree with you.

703
00:46:09,953 --> 00:46:12,973
And as a technologist, I understand exactly what you're saying.

704
00:46:12,973 --> 00:46:16,534
But I think a lot of those details get lost, though, because I try to explain

705
00:46:16,534 --> 00:46:21,455
to people why face ID, when you have a secure enclave on the phone, is OK.

706
00:46:21,455 --> 00:46:23,276
But face ID in the cloud is not OK.

707
00:46:23,276 --> 00:46:24,796
You understand it.

708
00:46:24,796 --> 00:46:25,816
But I think a lot of people don't.

709
00:46:25,816 --> 00:46:27,557
That's just face ID to them.

710
00:46:27,557 --> 00:46:28,717
And they say ban face ID.

711
00:46:28,717 --> 00:46:31,718
And there's a lot of these technologies, a lot of the biometrics.

712
00:46:31,898 --> 00:46:36,102
can be very valuable when they work for us, when they work for our benefit.

713
00:46:36,102 --> 00:46:40,085
They can help improve our cognition. They can help us focus on our work.

714
00:46:40,085 --> 00:46:43,608
They're really valuable technologies, things like eye tracking, which are going to be

715
00:46:43,608 --> 00:46:47,892
in a variety of HMDs in the next couple of years. We'll see. Facebook's already talked about

716
00:46:47,892 --> 00:46:52,536
what they're doing there. A very valuable technology for being able to help us actually

717
00:46:52,536 --> 00:46:57,701
focus and relate to each other. But the key is, I mean, I think, and a way to put this for people

718
00:46:57,701 --> 00:47:00,183
who are non-technical, is the question is,

719
00:47:00,283 --> 00:47:06,570
Are these technologies being used for us or are they being used for someone else who isn't acting in our benefit?

720
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:08,873
And that goes to the business model.

721
00:47:08,873 --> 00:47:11,256
And the reason we have such distrust at this point,

722
00:47:11,256 --> 00:47:14,039
and why we shouldn't trust anybody and agree with you on that,

723
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:15,240
is because they've abused it.

724
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:18,925
In the name of the business model, the business model is going to lead

725
00:47:19,225 --> 00:47:23,908
Companies who make their money off of advertising and other exploitive technologies,

726
00:47:23,908 --> 00:47:27,090
not that advertising itself is bad, but the exploitive part is bad,

727
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:31,854
they are always going to tend to want to extract this information from us

728
00:47:31,854 --> 00:47:34,916
and use it in a way that benefits someone else and not us.

729
00:47:34,916 --> 00:47:37,397
And so what we need to be banning is the exploitation.

730
00:47:37,397 --> 00:47:40,940
What we need to be banning is the manipulative use of this technology,

731
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:42,381
not the technologies themselves.

732
00:47:43,046 --> 00:47:44,848
when they can be proven to be used to our benefit,

733
00:47:44,848 --> 00:47:45,408
to our personal benefit.

734
00:47:45,408 --> 00:47:47,029
And this even goes beyond consent,

735
00:47:47,029 --> 00:47:48,611
because it brings up the next question as well.

736
00:47:48,611 --> 00:47:50,052
If we just agree to it, it's okay.

737
00:47:50,052 --> 00:47:51,693
These things are so complicated.

738
00:47:51,693 --> 00:47:54,235
And even the scientists who work

739
00:47:54,235 --> 00:47:56,117
on the machine learning algorithms

740
00:47:56,117 --> 00:47:58,178
don't even understand how they work half the time,

741
00:47:58,178 --> 00:47:59,419
and they just work.

742
00:47:59,419 --> 00:48:02,202
And so you can't expect a lay person

743
00:48:02,202 --> 00:48:03,603
to be able to consent to something

744
00:48:03,603 --> 00:48:05,524
that the company doesn't even understand how it works.

745
00:48:05,524 --> 00:48:06,946
So we have to be assuming

746
00:48:06,946 --> 00:48:08,747
that we can't consent to these things.

747
00:48:08,907 --> 00:48:13,711
And we have to be proving that they're innocuous and that they work for our benefit.

748
00:48:13,711 --> 00:48:17,034
You know, in the same way that the health industry has had to prove over a year,

749
00:48:17,034 --> 00:48:20,617
first, do no harm, first prove that you're actually helping people

750
00:48:20,617 --> 00:48:22,659
and that and don't do experiments on people.

751
00:48:22,659 --> 00:48:25,741
Don't do things that you're going to harm their health, even though it still happens.

752
00:48:25,741 --> 00:48:27,583
We have laws about these things. We have rules.

753
00:48:28,283 --> 00:48:33,085
Hippocratic Oath, all these things push us in a direction of saying, don't abuse people.

754
00:48:33,085 --> 00:48:39,587
And we don't have that yet for all this cognitive technology, which can easily be used to abuse

755
00:48:39,587 --> 00:48:39,987
people.

756
00:48:39,987 --> 00:48:46,690
This falls a lot on maybe on card expertise, but a lot of the arguments that you are talking

757
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:50,891
are kind of the same arguments we are debating when talking about facial recognition and

758
00:48:50,891 --> 00:48:54,813
artificial intelligence, about security, about people that.

759
00:48:56,258 --> 00:48:59,540
is being, that is abusing these technologies

760
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:00,980
and because they can control it.

761
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:03,181
And this kind of creates this technocracy

762
00:49:03,181 --> 00:49:06,863
where you don't understand these technologies.

763
00:49:06,863 --> 00:49:08,964
So you are being a subject to them.

764
00:49:08,964 --> 00:49:12,145
But this probably falls more on CART's expertise.

765
00:49:13,852 --> 00:49:30,343
Well, I would say like one of the things that I actually would make a pitch for all the game developers who are looking at these technologies and developing it now, if you create a system that gives people that kind of trust that they can put their data into a system and feel confident about it, I think that's going to be a winning proposition.

766
00:49:30,343 --> 00:49:41,991
And one of the reasons why people are a little leery about Facebook getting into the metaverse is that Facebook has had a number of things that have broken trust in the past.

767
00:49:42,751 --> 00:49:49,352
And so getting ahead of that and saying, we're going to have a system where you have control

768
00:49:49,352 --> 00:49:54,993
over your information and it's for real, then that's going to be a better system.

769
00:49:54,993 --> 00:49:59,674
If people believe that that's true and you can back that up, I think technology,

770
00:49:59,674 --> 00:50:04,255
that does back it up, as Dylan was saying, but I think that also we need to have policies that

771
00:50:04,255 --> 00:50:09,456
back that up, looking at it from a legal policy and technology perspective to get to that.

772
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:16,772
That was a great point to kind of close the debate.

773
00:50:16,772 --> 00:50:17,652
This has been amazing.

774
00:50:17,652 --> 00:50:20,313
And I want to kind of speak like for hours about this

775
00:50:20,313 --> 00:50:22,313
with each and every one of you,

776
00:50:22,313 --> 00:50:24,374
because you are such amazing.

777
00:50:24,374 --> 00:50:28,175
And my mind is blown of all the things you know

778
00:50:28,175 --> 00:50:30,876
and all the things on the doors you are opening.

779
00:50:30,876 --> 00:50:34,838
So we had to stop here and we have five minutes for Q&A,

780
00:50:34,838 --> 00:50:37,679
for a brief Q&A, if someone has a question

781
00:50:37,679 --> 00:50:39,599
that we can answer in five minutes,

782
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:42,080
which is probably not the case, but let's do it anyway.

783
00:50:48,173 --> 00:50:52,578
Thank you, everybody.

784
00:50:52,578 --> 00:50:53,879
Can you hear me?

785
00:50:53,879 --> 00:50:54,019
Yes.

786
00:50:54,019 --> 00:50:56,942
Yeah, I first off just wanted to say

787
00:50:56,942 --> 00:50:58,864
thank you for talking about this.

788
00:50:58,864 --> 00:51:02,307
I do talks on this stuff here on SF.

789
00:51:02,307 --> 00:51:07,652
And hearing other people talk about this is very valuable.

790
00:51:08,553 --> 00:51:17,599
confirms a lot of issues I've been seeing. My question is a bit about the biosensor stuff you

791
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:27,245
guys just mentioned which is for game devs how do you think a good way of educating game developers

792
00:51:27,245 --> 00:51:34,069
about these biosensors and the ethical issues since game developers want to have access to the

793
00:51:34,069 --> 00:51:36,851
data to use it during games?

794
00:51:37,411 --> 00:51:46,820
How should they implement biosensors to use this type of data safely and securely and ethically?

795
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:54,367
I'll just take a quick stab at it to say that the first rule is never upload it to the cloud.

796
00:51:54,367 --> 00:51:59,491
Use it locally and you can use it to improve someone's game experience.

797
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:01,133
Great, but don't save it.

798
00:52:01,525 --> 00:52:04,287
If you can avoid creating metadata from it,

799
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:05,569
don't try to create metadata,

800
00:52:05,569 --> 00:52:07,611
especially don't use it for what you don't need,

801
00:52:07,611 --> 00:52:09,653
and just delete it, get rid of it.

802
00:52:09,653 --> 00:52:12,655
Don't store it, don't allow third parties access to it.

803
00:52:12,655 --> 00:52:16,039
Try to prove that every use of the data

804
00:52:16,039 --> 00:52:18,281
is for the benefit of the player in this case.

805
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:20,241
And I would build upon that.

806
00:52:20,241 --> 00:52:23,162
Absolutely agree with what Avi mentioned there.

807
00:52:23,162 --> 00:52:25,963
I spoke about homomorphic encryption previously

808
00:52:25,963 --> 00:52:28,825
and that I've implemented it in a number of scenarios

809
00:52:28,825 --> 00:52:31,066
that are game-based scenarios at this point

810
00:52:31,066 --> 00:52:33,407
where you can have computation on data

811
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:35,488
that is exchanged between clients

812
00:52:35,488 --> 00:52:38,229
that is completely encrypted and is never decrypted.

813
00:52:38,229 --> 00:52:40,510
So anyone right now can go into GitHub,

814
00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:42,291
pull up a million repos that implement

815
00:52:42,291 --> 00:52:44,372
homomorphic encryption in whatever your engine.

816
00:52:44,412 --> 00:52:47,893
choices or in some abstract library, you can do this today.

817
00:52:47,893 --> 00:52:50,474
You actually, you never need to decrypt the data

818
00:52:50,474 --> 00:52:52,675
in order to provide the personalized experience,

819
00:52:52,675 --> 00:52:54,976
be it a homepage or be it a game experience.

820
00:52:54,976 --> 00:52:58,277
Just have to make sure that at the other end,

821
00:52:58,277 --> 00:52:59,837
when it's decrypted on some other client,

822
00:52:59,837 --> 00:53:02,238
that it can't be siphoned off at that end either.

823
00:53:02,238 --> 00:53:05,099
But it would never be decrypted in this case.

824
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:07,881
That's the whole part is you only get the end results

825
00:53:07,881 --> 00:53:10,582
of the operation that's performed on the data.

826
00:53:10,662 --> 00:53:12,003
Just to make it a concrete example,

827
00:53:12,003 --> 00:53:13,424
I know we don't have a lot of time,

828
00:53:13,424 --> 00:53:15,186
but let's say it's my face

829
00:53:15,186 --> 00:53:16,547
and we're worried about identity theft.

830
00:53:16,547 --> 00:53:18,229
And so we have to create avatars

831
00:53:18,229 --> 00:53:20,511
and we want to create eventually photorealistic avatars.

832
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:21,532
So at some point,

833
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:24,715
my face is going to be transmitted to you on your side

834
00:53:24,715 --> 00:53:26,556
and we can encrypt it along the way,

835
00:53:26,556 --> 00:53:27,457
different kind of encryption,

836
00:53:27,457 --> 00:53:28,638
not exactly what we're talking about,

837
00:53:28,638 --> 00:53:31,361
but at some point it's going to get decrypted

838
00:53:31,361 --> 00:53:33,723
and the client on the other end is going to receive it.

839
00:53:33,723 --> 00:53:34,904
And we have to be very careful

840
00:53:34,904 --> 00:53:37,086
that that can't be siphoned off and used.

841
00:53:37,387 --> 00:53:42,165
for someone to pretend to be me and impersonate me to my bed, for example, or something worse.

842
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:50,791
Hi guys, I'm John McMath, also known as the Samurai Lawyer in the VR space.

843
00:53:50,791 --> 00:53:53,233
Really glad to see you all.

844
00:53:53,233 --> 00:54:03,841
My question is about the difficulty of communicating technological specifications to lawmakers

845
00:54:03,841 --> 00:54:05,402
specifically.

846
00:54:05,402 --> 00:54:09,505
You guys have talked a lot about the need for legislation.

847
00:54:09,505 --> 00:54:10,366
By way of analogy...

848
00:54:11,107 --> 00:54:19,693
Sometimes I have to explain to a judge or a jury around here what mass spectrometer is or how DNA testing works.

849
00:54:19,693 --> 00:54:30,582
And that's when you start to realize that there can be that disconnect between the lawmaker and the scientific grasp or sophistication.

850
00:54:30,582 --> 00:54:33,864
So I'm wondering if you guys can address how do we bridge that gap.

851
00:54:37,619 --> 00:54:41,360
I can go a quick on that, that for me,

852
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:45,702
I do a lot of work in education on policy makers,

853
00:54:45,702 --> 00:54:47,182
but also on regular people.

854
00:54:47,182 --> 00:54:51,464
And I think that one of the keys is trying to make people

855
00:54:51,464 --> 00:54:53,625
understand through simple analysis

856
00:54:53,625 --> 00:54:57,666
and trying to make them feel welcome into the technology.

857
00:54:57,666 --> 00:55:00,247
Because for a lot of people, when they hear technology

858
00:55:00,247 --> 00:55:03,088
and particularly people that come from like law

859
00:55:03,088 --> 00:55:05,249
and other areas that are kind of more social,

860
00:55:05,249 --> 00:55:06,469
they tend to close down.

861
00:55:06,997 --> 00:55:10,919
So you need to translate the abstract ideas and the concepts

862
00:55:10,919 --> 00:55:13,200
and the importance of this.

863
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:18,342
Not only just, and kind of bring those difficult technical terms

864
00:55:18,342 --> 00:55:24,245
into a way that they feel welcome to understand that.

865
00:55:24,245 --> 00:55:26,746
I would second that completely.

866
00:55:26,746 --> 00:55:32,349
There are a number of lawyers, particularly in

867
00:55:34,095 --> 00:55:48,675
I think in academia and also in policy that try to specialize in explaining technical issues to a legal audience that sometimes it usually also the lawyers.

868
00:55:49,105 --> 00:55:54,909
It is very difficult because sometimes you have to get past that perception that, oh,

869
00:55:54,909 --> 00:56:00,933
this is something, it's either complicated or I don't need to know about this, or even

870
00:56:00,933 --> 00:56:04,496
worse, the filter that already exists is lobbyist.

871
00:56:04,496 --> 00:56:10,740
It's sometimes very difficult that the technology is being explained by someone that has an

872
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:14,983
agenda and is getting paid to do that.

873
00:56:14,983 --> 00:56:17,385
So it's sometimes a very thankless job.

874
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:26,883
I can only say that, you know, videos, all sorts of popular engagement that you can do

875
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:33,749
as a technologist that can be understood by lawyers and by lawmakers, it's useful,

876
00:56:33,749 --> 00:56:38,373
it's very useful. I've used lots of videos when trying to explain things to

877
00:56:38,373 --> 00:56:43,717
policymakers to make it easier. The more content that we can have access to, the better.

878
00:56:44,741 --> 00:56:46,922
I've just tried collaborating.

879
00:56:46,922 --> 00:56:48,722
I'll collaborate with lawyers whenever

880
00:56:48,722 --> 00:56:51,143
you want to help try to explain these things.

881
00:56:51,143 --> 00:56:54,524
And I think what matters is not just to simplify the tech,

882
00:56:54,524 --> 00:56:56,185
because otherwise, if you simplify it,

883
00:56:56,185 --> 00:56:59,346
you wind up with some lawmaker talking about a series of tubes

884
00:56:59,346 --> 00:57:02,107
and not really understanding the details.

885
00:57:02,107 --> 00:57:04,928
But if you tell it in terms of stories, and you say,

886
00:57:04,928 --> 00:57:07,709
you imagine you're walking down the street, and this happens.

887
00:57:07,709 --> 00:57:09,430
And then this happens, and then this happens.

888
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:10,630
Everybody can understand that.

889
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:13,471
And so that's been the most effective way is to turn these things into stories.

890
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:17,692
And then what you want is the lawyers to come back and poke holes in it to say, is that

891
00:57:17,692 --> 00:57:18,512
really going to happen?

892
00:57:18,512 --> 00:57:21,993
Like, is that, are you just dreaming or is that actually really likely?

893
00:57:21,993 --> 00:57:23,613
And you got to be very, very clear about that.

894
00:57:23,613 --> 00:57:26,434
Cause you don't want to, you don't want to, you know, cry wolf.

895
00:57:26,434 --> 00:57:30,755
You want to, you want to really talk about the real dangers of, of, of what's likely

896
00:57:30,755 --> 00:57:33,336
to happen based on what we know and the realities of things.

897
00:57:35,512 --> 00:57:39,297
I'll just add to this that it would be great if lawmakers,

898
00:57:39,297 --> 00:57:43,183
policymakers also employed technologists in-house

899
00:57:43,183 --> 00:57:47,029
that would help understand these issues.

900
00:57:47,029 --> 00:57:50,734
And, you know, I think we have we have a good set of geeky lawyers.

901
00:57:51,434 --> 00:57:53,216
several on this on the Zoom,

902
00:57:53,216 --> 00:57:56,759
but also on the side of policymakers

903
00:57:56,759 --> 00:57:58,980
so that they can get that geek to geek protocol

904
00:57:58,980 --> 00:57:59,901
to transfer the information

905
00:57:59,901 --> 00:58:02,804
and have that be embedded in the policy.

906
00:58:02,804 --> 00:58:04,945
The policy is based on the actual technologies,

907
00:58:04,945 --> 00:58:08,308
not just now, but the ones that are being foreseen

908
00:58:08,308 --> 00:58:08,969
so we can get ahead.

909
00:58:08,969 --> 00:58:14,153
I think we don't have more time.

910
00:58:14,153 --> 00:58:16,815
So thank you everyone for coming for this panel

911
00:58:16,815 --> 00:58:18,497
and a big round of applause

912
00:58:18,497 --> 00:58:19,678
to our incredible panelists here.
