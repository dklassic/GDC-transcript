00:00:05,698 --> 00:00:10,843
Hi all, and welcome to our talk about the music for Ghost of Tsushima.

2
00:00:10,843 --> 00:00:15,848
I'm Peter Scaturro, one of the score producers, and I'll be taking you through the process

3
00:00:15,848 --> 00:00:17,229
of creating the score for this game.

4
00:00:17,229 --> 00:00:26,698
We'll also hear from two other leads on the project, Bill Hempstapat, who is going to

5
00:00:26,698 --> 00:00:31,202
cover the details that went into the musical arrangement choices, and you'll also hear

6
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:36,027
Andrew Barash, who will cover the development of the music

7
00:00:36,027 --> 00:00:36,807
system.

8
00:00:36,807 --> 00:00:39,128
This was a big production for our team.

9
00:00:39,128 --> 00:00:42,310
And at times, this felt like as epic a journey

10
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:45,011
as our lead character, Jin Sakai.

11
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:47,013
We recorded on three different continents.

12
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:51,275
We had two composers, had some unplanned last minute recording

13
00:00:51,275 --> 00:00:55,037
needs, and made some interesting advancements in the open world

14
00:00:55,037 --> 00:00:55,697
music system.

15
00:00:56,704 --> 00:01:02,436
So excited to get into all of this, these topics and show also how the recording,

16
00:01:02,436 --> 00:01:05,021
editing and implementation of the music.

17
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:15,383
are related. So let's get into this the way that most all of our projects start, and that is with

18
00:01:15,383 --> 00:01:22,165
a kickoff meeting with the developer. So in this case, that was done, of course, with Sucker Punch.

19
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:27,487
So a lot of good information we got during our initial meeting with them,

20
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:31,768
and this is where the creative leads there. So Nate Fox and also Jason Connell.

21
00:01:32,169 --> 00:01:33,449
and Brad Meyer.

22
00:01:33,449 --> 00:01:36,950
They gave us what was a really inspiring presentation,

23
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,711
and we covered the plot of the story.

24
00:01:38,711 --> 00:01:43,873
And for those of you who may have not played the game,

25
00:01:43,873 --> 00:01:47,774
it's about the Mongol invasion of Tsushima.

26
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:51,976
So this happened in the, I believe the 13th century,

27
00:01:51,976 --> 00:01:54,497
and there's some historical basis for this.

28
00:01:56,709 --> 00:02:00,193
What happens is the Mongols invade Tsushima

29
00:02:00,193 --> 00:02:06,822
and the island is being run by 80 samurai there.

30
00:02:06,822 --> 00:02:09,906
They all get slaughtered except for one of them.

31
00:02:09,906 --> 00:02:12,830
And that one that survived is our hero, Jin Sakai.

32
00:02:13,637 --> 00:02:19,222
And during the story, Jin goes through a struggle and some transformation.

33
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:22,666
He's got a conflict and the conflict is this.

34
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:28,591
He's struggling to adhere to his samurai code.

35
00:02:28,591 --> 00:02:34,016
And his samurai code is a way of fighting or way of engaging enemies.

36
00:02:34,016 --> 00:02:39,121
That was he was taught by his surrogate father, Lord Shimura.

37
00:02:39,892 --> 00:02:44,277
But in order to be able to defend the island

38
00:02:44,277 --> 00:02:46,459
and also protect his people, he devised,

39
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:49,883
he developed some other fighting techniques along the way

40
00:02:49,883 --> 00:02:51,705
that are considered dishonorable.

41
00:02:52,264 --> 00:02:55,746
Now, we also find out that Lord Shimura has survived as well

42
00:02:55,746 --> 00:02:57,487
and has been taken captive.

43
00:02:57,487 --> 00:02:59,828
And that kind of sets up the story.

44
00:02:59,828 --> 00:03:04,511
So a lot of emotional stuff in there.

45
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:07,272
And that was a great takeaway for us to know that.

46
00:03:07,272 --> 00:03:10,114
The other thing that we learned during this meeting

47
00:03:10,114 --> 00:03:14,997
was what the look of the game and what the environment was,

48
00:03:14,997 --> 00:03:16,157
how that was going to appear.

49
00:03:17,371 --> 00:03:31,654
So you can see from some of the pictures that are in the slide here the world is absolutely gorgeous and for those of you who play the game you know this, and a lot of detail or time went into the detail of how these environments

50
00:03:31,654 --> 00:03:31,854
look.

51
00:03:32,147 --> 00:03:33,668
They're really stunning.

52
00:03:33,668 --> 00:03:37,271
They also have a bit of a stylized look to them,

53
00:03:37,271 --> 00:03:40,113
which was something that kind of stuck in our brain as well.

54
00:03:40,113 --> 00:03:42,614
And we just thought, hmm, well, based on this look,

55
00:03:42,614 --> 00:03:46,897
what would be the right music for this?

56
00:03:46,897 --> 00:03:50,019
Circle Punch also came to this meeting

57
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:53,041
with some ideas about what they wanted from the score.

58
00:03:53,682 --> 00:03:56,504
and what style they were aiming for.

59
00:03:56,504 --> 00:03:58,025
They, of course, wanted something

60
00:03:58,025 --> 00:04:01,468
that is going to reflect the time and place,

61
00:04:01,468 --> 00:04:03,609
and that is feudal Japan.

62
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:06,111
So we immediately knew that this was

63
00:04:06,111 --> 00:04:08,053
going to be a score that is going

64
00:04:08,053 --> 00:04:11,375
to have quite a lot of Japanese influence,

65
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:16,319
particularly Japanese solo instruments and all the things

66
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:18,161
that are idiosyncratic about that.

67
00:04:19,612 --> 00:04:25,575
Um, we, uh, also knew that, uh, or, or they, they let us know that they wanted

68
00:04:25,575 --> 00:04:31,538
the score to, um, for the most part, be very minimalist and be very sparse at

69
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:31,738
times.

70
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:34,499
And they were, uh, not afraid of that at all.

71
00:04:34,499 --> 00:04:38,241
In fact, they, they were really looking for that kind of execution from the music.

72
00:04:38,241 --> 00:04:42,123
Now, we also knew from the story though, that there's going to be some emotional

73
00:04:42,123 --> 00:04:44,684
moments, there's some big battle scenes and all of that.

74
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:48,126
So we wanted to, of course, have music that's going to.

75
00:04:48,607 --> 00:04:50,967
support that epic portion of the story.

76
00:04:50,967 --> 00:04:55,369
So armed with all of this, we got

77
00:04:55,369 --> 00:05:00,470
on to what the next phase of our work is,

78
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,431
and that's to look for a composer,

79
00:05:02,431 --> 00:05:04,611
or in this case composers, that would

80
00:05:04,611 --> 00:05:07,672
be right for this project.

81
00:05:07,672 --> 00:05:14,874
Initially, we talked to Shigeru Umebayashi, or Ume,

82
00:05:14,874 --> 00:05:16,675
how he likes to be.

83
00:05:17,557 --> 00:05:21,682
known. Now, Ume seemed like an obvious choice for us at the time.

84
00:05:21,682 --> 00:05:25,488
And that's just based on his impressive body of work and his

85
00:05:25,488 --> 00:05:28,592
experience with both Japanese and Chinese films.

86
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:34,601
Ume wrote some really, really beautiful music for Ghost.

87
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:39,722
We eventually settled on five fairly lengthy pieces

88
00:05:39,722 --> 00:05:43,162
that he delivered to us and they had various moods.

89
00:05:43,162 --> 00:05:44,963
We call them the Tsushima Suites

90
00:05:44,963 --> 00:05:46,443
and you can hear them on the soundtrack.

91
00:05:46,443 --> 00:05:48,883
They're really gorgeous.

92
00:05:48,883 --> 00:05:52,004
Now this music you can really hear

93
00:05:52,004 --> 00:05:53,884
when you're exploring the island.

94
00:05:53,884 --> 00:05:55,605
So if you're just walking around and you wanna

95
00:05:56,509 --> 00:05:58,772
just enjoy the environment there.

96
00:05:58,772 --> 00:06:00,513
A lot of times what you're going to hear

97
00:06:00,513 --> 00:06:02,515
is Ume's music is going to come up

98
00:06:02,515 --> 00:06:05,198
and he did just an outstanding job

99
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,820
of giving us a sound for Tsushima.

100
00:06:09,571 --> 00:06:15,492
We also, well, there's some of Ume's films.

101
00:06:15,492 --> 00:06:20,294
We also reached out to Ilan Eskeri,

102
00:06:20,294 --> 00:06:25,975
and we had, while Ume wrote some beautiful music for us

103
00:06:25,975 --> 00:06:27,995
for the island, we also knew that we needed

104
00:06:27,995 --> 00:06:32,137
some character themes and we also needed some combat music.

105
00:06:32,137 --> 00:06:34,257
And Ilan, for the most part,

106
00:06:34,257 --> 00:06:37,378
wound up taking charge of that territory.

107
00:06:38,762 --> 00:06:44,306
He is known for his score to 47 Ronin,

108
00:06:44,306 --> 00:06:49,511
which convinced us that he has some experience

109
00:06:49,511 --> 00:06:52,373
with Japanese instruments, so he knows about that.

110
00:06:52,373 --> 00:06:56,557
He is just a terrific melodic composer

111
00:06:56,557 --> 00:07:00,200
and he really captured the Jin's inner conflict

112
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,261
and his struggles with Lord Shimura.

113
00:07:02,261 --> 00:07:02,461
So.

114
00:07:03,371 --> 00:07:08,193
You can also hear those themes on the soundtrack.

115
00:07:08,193 --> 00:07:12,574
One of the things that really stood out to us about Alain

116
00:07:12,574 --> 00:07:15,275
when we were doing this composer search

117
00:07:15,275 --> 00:07:20,117
was this indie film that he wrote the score to,

118
00:07:20,117 --> 00:07:21,578
and it's Coriolanus.

119
00:07:22,378 --> 00:07:25,621
And it really has very little to do

120
00:07:25,621 --> 00:07:28,803
with this particular project except for one aspect of it.

121
00:07:28,803 --> 00:07:34,508
And that is that it has a minimalist sound.

122
00:07:34,508 --> 00:07:38,271
It's very sparse, but also has a very stylized sound to it.

123
00:07:38,271 --> 00:07:40,733
It's like when you're listening to the score,

124
00:07:40,733 --> 00:07:44,556
the percussion in particular, it just sounds very arresting.

125
00:07:44,556 --> 00:07:46,198
It feels like it's just coming off

126
00:07:46,198 --> 00:07:47,659
of the edge of the speakers.

127
00:07:47,659 --> 00:07:48,219
And.

128
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,322
It just, it's got that, I don't know, just sort of catches your ear in a very interesting way.

129
00:07:54,322 --> 00:08:00,845
And we thought if we could take some of that sensibility and use that in the production of

130
00:08:00,845 --> 00:08:08,367
the music for Ghost that we would have something that would reflect the environment of the game,

131
00:08:08,367 --> 00:08:14,410
and of course, you know, support the story and support the setting.

132
00:08:16,402 --> 00:08:22,205
After getting the composers on board, we set out to create a

133
00:08:22,205 --> 00:08:28,727
recording plan for this. And as I mentioned earlier, we recorded

134
00:08:28,727 --> 00:08:34,330
on three continents. Initially, we went to London and the UK.

135
00:08:35,995 --> 00:08:38,918
This is a place that we're accustomed to recording.

136
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:40,539
We use the studios there a lot.

137
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:44,182
The orchestral musicians are absolutely fantastic in London.

138
00:08:44,182 --> 00:08:48,246
And the studios are brilliant.

139
00:08:48,246 --> 00:08:50,328
The engineering staff is familiar with some

140
00:08:50,328 --> 00:08:53,030
of the technical requirements that we have for video game

141
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,370
production.

142
00:08:54,185 --> 00:08:58,328
So we went there initially for the orchestral recording.

143
00:08:58,328 --> 00:09:01,169
Air Studios, some of you might be familiar with that

144
00:09:01,169 --> 00:09:05,352
if you recorded in London, it's just a brilliant location.

145
00:09:05,352 --> 00:09:10,654
Converted Church, here are some pictures

146
00:09:10,654 --> 00:09:11,495
of the control room.

147
00:09:12,615 --> 00:09:14,296
I'm sorry, the recording room.

148
00:09:14,296 --> 00:09:15,436
This is in the hall.

149
00:09:15,436 --> 00:09:18,677
And you can clearly see here from the inside

150
00:09:18,677 --> 00:09:20,658
that this is a converted church.

151
00:09:20,658 --> 00:09:23,138
It has a really interesting sound to it.

152
00:09:23,138 --> 00:09:27,819
It's reverberant, but it kind of has this sparkle to it.

153
00:09:27,819 --> 00:09:30,240
It really lives up to its name, air.

154
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:38,246
and it just a very, very, very pleasant sound inside the hall,

155
00:09:38,246 --> 00:09:40,508
especially when you've got a full string section

156
00:09:40,508 --> 00:09:43,150
and brass section playing.

157
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:48,193
Here is a view of inside the control room there.

158
00:09:48,193 --> 00:09:53,157
You can see Ume sort of center stage.

159
00:09:53,157 --> 00:09:57,040
We also recorded at Abbey Road, which

160
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,102
is one of the other really.

161
00:09:59,603 --> 00:10:02,424
well-known famous studios that's in London.

162
00:10:02,424 --> 00:10:04,505
And I believe there was a week,

163
00:10:04,505 --> 00:10:07,526
this was probably fall of 2019,

164
00:10:07,526 --> 00:10:12,127
where we were recording with Umeh at Ayer

165
00:10:12,127 --> 00:10:14,148
and simultaneously we were recording

166
00:10:14,148 --> 00:10:16,808
at Abbey Road with Elan.

167
00:10:16,808 --> 00:10:19,389
So that was just sort of an exciting thing for us

168
00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:21,590
to have all of that action happening at once.

169
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,904
Here's another photo.

170
00:10:24,904 --> 00:10:28,849
This is from one of the other studios,

171
00:10:28,849 --> 00:10:30,812
a smaller rooms at Aire.

172
00:10:30,812 --> 00:10:35,458
This is a Taiko ensemble that we recorded there.

173
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,721
These are some Japanese musicians,

174
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:39,123
obviously living in London.

175
00:10:39,718 --> 00:10:42,939
and a lot of this particular ensemble,

176
00:10:42,939 --> 00:10:46,180
which was a three-person ensemble we used

177
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,360
for a lot of the combat music.

178
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,601
Now, one of the things that,

179
00:10:49,601 --> 00:10:53,622
you know, at the same time that we're recording this,

180
00:10:53,622 --> 00:10:55,823
we're of course, you know, learning things

181
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:59,363
during our journey about Japanese music

182
00:10:59,363 --> 00:11:01,864
and about, in this particular case,

183
00:11:01,864 --> 00:11:03,905
learning about taiko ensembles.

184
00:11:04,645 --> 00:11:09,248
So we wanted to have the sound of a larger ensemble.

185
00:11:09,248 --> 00:11:11,430
You know, there's just something about that,

186
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:14,993
that you can't achieve by doing individual overdubs.

187
00:11:14,993 --> 00:11:18,535
So we decided to look into recording in Japan.

188
00:11:18,535 --> 00:11:21,738
And this was one of the reasons that we wound up.

189
00:11:21,978 --> 00:11:37,742
recording globally was that we felt like we needed to go to Japan and we needed to go to the source and find a taiko ensemble that we thought would be reflective of the really, really big parts of the game, most of the battles.

190
00:11:37,742 --> 00:11:48,145
So while we were there, we also recorded some Japanese soloists there playing some Japanese instruments.

191
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:55,731
and some of the performances there were absolutely incredible and really made the score.

192
00:11:55,731 --> 00:12:02,303
This is Oyama-san playing the shamisen, which is a like a, as you can see, kind of like a

193
00:12:03,063 --> 00:12:07,224
Japanese sort of guitar sounds a little bit like a banjo. It's

194
00:12:07,224 --> 00:12:09,825
got its own unique sound though, and you you know it when you

195
00:12:09,825 --> 00:12:16,647
hear it. This is Sogawa-san, who was just a master shakuhachi

196
00:12:16,647 --> 00:12:22,349
player and just could not play a bad note. It was just absolutely

197
00:12:22,349 --> 00:12:26,850
thrilling just to hear him play. He was he was incredible. This

198
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:32,352
is Yomada-san, who played the koto and also the bass koto.

199
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:40,367
And again, all of these masters at Japanese instruments.

200
00:12:40,367 --> 00:12:48,776
We also had a scene in the game where it was a funeral scene.

201
00:12:48,776 --> 00:12:52,880
And we wanted to have some monks singing

202
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,223
during this funeral scene.

203
00:12:55,223 --> 00:12:55,843
So we

204
00:12:56,703 --> 00:13:02,087
We're very lucky to have these two monks

205
00:13:02,087 --> 00:13:04,849
who did some chanting for us.

206
00:13:04,849 --> 00:13:12,054
They were actually from a Buddhist sect called Ichiren.

207
00:13:12,054 --> 00:13:15,936
And there's historically, this sect actually connects

208
00:13:15,936 --> 00:13:18,858
to the place in Japan where the Mongols originally invaded.

209
00:13:18,858 --> 00:13:20,319
So it was interesting to get.

210
00:13:20,838 --> 00:13:25,161
you know, that kind of level of authenticity there.

211
00:13:25,161 --> 00:13:28,723
So really, really happy and delighted about that.

212
00:13:28,723 --> 00:13:35,047
This is a Taiko ensemble, as I mentioned,

213
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:38,350
that we had, this was an eight-person ensemble,

214
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:42,412
and the sound in the studio for this was really thunderous

215
00:13:42,412 --> 00:13:45,955
and really, really terrific,

216
00:13:45,955 --> 00:13:47,856
really like kind of captured that power.

217
00:13:48,436 --> 00:13:51,218
that you hear in a lot of Japanese music

218
00:13:51,218 --> 00:13:54,120
or that use a taiko ensemble of this size.

219
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,703
So that's just a little bit about the recording process

220
00:13:58,703 --> 00:13:59,763
and what we did.

221
00:13:59,763 --> 00:14:02,265
I wanna hand it over now to Bill

222
00:14:02,265 --> 00:14:04,406
and he's gonna do a deeper dive

223
00:14:04,406 --> 00:14:07,569
into some of the creative and technical arranging

224
00:14:07,569 --> 00:14:09,970
that we did and how that relates to our music system.

225
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,171
So over to you, Bill.

226
00:14:12,823 --> 00:14:19,200
Cool. Thank you so much, Pete. Hi, everyone. My name is Bill. Thank you for watching this video today.

227
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:26,273
Now that we've talked about how the music was created and Pete gave a really great run-through

228
00:14:26,273 --> 00:14:31,735
of our recording process and it was really actually one of my once-in-a-lifetime

229
00:14:31,735 --> 00:14:35,176
experience that I got to be a part of those recordings. Definitely something that I won't

230
00:14:35,176 --> 00:14:40,878
forget anytime soon. But now that we've talked about that, let's look at in general what

231
00:14:40,878 --> 00:14:43,399
we have to do with them afterwards.

232
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:50,074
As an arranger of the project, I'm mostly going to focus on the creative and technical arranging

233
00:14:50,074 --> 00:14:55,897
aspect of it, and I will elaborate as to why I have to be so specific to call out the creative

234
00:14:55,897 --> 00:15:01,600
and technical terms separately. We'll understand that soon. But there's a huge bulk of work that

235
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,723
our team, myself and a few other folks on our team, that is kind of the bread and butter of

236
00:15:06,723 --> 00:15:11,425
what we do. And there's a big bulk of work here that we do before the music even gets

237
00:15:11,425 --> 00:15:13,606
implemented into the game.

238
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:22,519
But first, let's explain a little bit about where somebody like myself kind of sits into

239
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:24,161
the production here.

240
00:15:24,161 --> 00:15:30,486
As you can see, I'm kind of slotted somewhere in the middle of music production and implementation

241
00:15:30,486 --> 00:15:31,307
and testing.

242
00:15:32,207 --> 00:15:38,452
The role that I play is to kind of act as a bridge between the composers of the game

243
00:15:38,452 --> 00:15:44,557
and the game itself, making sure to adapt what's written and recorded and making sure that to see

244
00:15:44,557 --> 00:15:50,362
the composer's vision through in the game. But at the same time, the reverse is always

245
00:15:50,362 --> 00:15:57,427
is also true as well, where I'm constantly coordinating backwards about the feedback

246
00:15:57,427 --> 00:15:59,769
from our early implementation and the prototypes.

247
00:16:00,305 --> 00:16:08,128
which help inform what needs to get produced and recorded further. This is very important actually,

248
00:16:08,128 --> 00:16:14,811
especially in creating systemic music. We had designed this system and directed a composer

249
00:16:14,811 --> 00:16:20,233
to write a specific way, and then we put that in the game and realized that, oh, it's not working

250
00:16:20,233 --> 00:16:27,736
quite as well as we thought it should. What do we do then? The music's already written and recorded.

251
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:29,077
But while this is kind of...

252
00:16:30,013 --> 00:16:35,995
what game development is. There's a lot of iterative process and a lot of iterations.

253
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:42,557
It's bound to happen, but really it's how we tackle the iteration process that's really

254
00:16:42,557 --> 00:16:47,119
key to success here. And we'll talk about that specifically in this talk.

255
00:16:50,195 --> 00:16:58,044
Alright, so first off, let's actually talk about the three main pillars of the experience that

256
00:16:58,044 --> 00:17:03,289
makes up Ghost of Tsushima as a whole. And I think more specifically, we want to focus on

257
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:09,276
the golden path, which is what we call for like the critical path storyline, essentially.

258
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:14,642
and it's okay by the way if you're not getting the picture right away there are some examples that

259
00:17:14,642 --> 00:17:20,325
will come in after this but i just want to walk through these and then we'll explain more of them

260
00:17:20,325 --> 00:17:27,308
as we go. So first off is the cinematics and a lot of people call these cut scenes right there

261
00:17:27,308 --> 00:17:35,853
these are very non-linear it plays like a film from top to bottom and our main approach here

262
00:17:35,853 --> 00:17:38,394
like what Pete said earlier is there

263
00:17:39,524 --> 00:17:45,627
We tried to execute Sucker Punch's brief on creating a minimalistic Japanese aesthetic

264
00:17:45,627 --> 00:17:53,431
as well as providing some epic story moment. And this is something that we want to infuse

265
00:17:53,431 --> 00:17:58,653
into every part of it, but cinematics are one part that where I think we did this very well.

266
00:17:58,653 --> 00:18:05,476
The second approach that we took was using a little bit of a free tempo approach that's

267
00:18:05,476 --> 00:18:08,297
inspired by traditional Japanese music.

268
00:18:10,878 --> 00:18:17,842
In traditional Japanese music, from my study and my interest in it that I find, there is this

269
00:18:17,842 --> 00:18:25,667
play of fluctuation of time and space that is very much a part of their music. And this also includes

270
00:18:25,667 --> 00:18:32,772
using silence as a musical device as well. So we had really incorporated that into the level

271
00:18:32,772 --> 00:18:34,933
that is even more macro than that.

272
00:18:35,397 --> 00:18:43,942
and that is picking where not to play music. And this has become equally as critical to use

273
00:18:43,942 --> 00:18:50,205
as a device to set up big epic moments is to have moments without music that come before that.

274
00:18:50,205 --> 00:18:56,708
The next pillar is the custom gameplay arrangements. And these are kind of being

275
00:18:56,708 --> 00:19:04,532
talked about internally for us as kind of semi non-linear moments.

276
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:14,181
And with this, it's kind of like players have control, but you're not actively going outside

277
00:19:14,181 --> 00:19:20,585
of this mission. There's not kind of this free agency that you could go do anything anywhere.

278
00:19:20,585 --> 00:19:26,808
It's somewhat a little bit on rails, like you're in the middle of this big battle or a duel or

279
00:19:26,808 --> 00:19:32,111
something like that. So these things will, like I said, will include special combat scenarios,

280
00:19:32,111 --> 00:19:34,072
duels, and then

281
00:19:34,542 --> 00:19:39,430
special singers, which in this case is something like, oh, you see a house getting burned down

282
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:45,340
and we want to play some reaction music to that. And there's kind of a framework for these things

283
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:48,525
and we want to make something that's tailored to that experience.

284
00:19:49,462 --> 00:19:55,325
And lastly, we have the systemic music. And this is one of the most important

285
00:19:55,325 --> 00:19:59,807
experiences in Ghost of Tsushima. Since this is an open world game,

286
00:19:59,807 --> 00:20:04,650
there's a lot of things that are happening systemically with a large degree of variables,

287
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:08,852
like the player's progression, strength, and play style.

288
00:20:08,852 --> 00:20:12,615
So now we're talking about a true non-linear experience.

289
00:20:13,075 --> 00:20:18,496
and this includes the Music Encounter System, which Andrew is going to touch upon. This is

290
00:20:18,496 --> 00:20:28,439
one of the very deep subjects of this. The Music Encounter System takes care of how we score combat

291
00:20:28,439 --> 00:20:32,500
in Ghost of Tsushima, and combat is a really large part of Ghost of Tsushima.

292
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:39,302
Next up, we also have the Exploration Mood System, and this is something that

293
00:20:39,733 --> 00:20:44,675
the players will hear as they walk through the game and this is something that we spent a lot

294
00:20:44,675 --> 00:20:50,258
of time on as well to make sure that throughout the 30 hours to even 60 hours of experience that

295
00:20:50,258 --> 00:20:55,260
you would never get tired of what this is. We'll show you some examples for this.

296
00:20:56,523 --> 00:21:02,445
And lastly are just little stingers that are specifically tied to mechanics in the game like

297
00:21:02,445 --> 00:21:10,628
the fox shrines, the haiku mechanics, the onsen, the shrine pillars of honors, and stuff like that.

298
00:21:10,628 --> 00:21:16,450
So we won't dive into every little stinger today, but just know that this is something

299
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:18,611
that we use to score the game as well. So first off,

300
00:21:22,443 --> 00:21:27,847
what's one of the most important thing that we need to get right away in order to execute all

301
00:21:27,847 --> 00:21:36,813
those three main pillars? And the first thing is some really wide stemming. And this is partly why

302
00:21:36,813 --> 00:21:38,774
I attended all the recording sessions.

303
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:45,161
because we not only want to split as many instruments as we could, but we also want to

304
00:21:45,161 --> 00:21:50,424
make it make sense musically. For example, if the strings are playing something in unison

305
00:21:50,424 --> 00:21:55,427
and they sound really good and big together, they should play together by all means. It's not that

306
00:21:55,427 --> 00:22:01,170
like, oh violins have to be split, violas have to be split. This is split musically by the musical

307
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:04,772
devices that they play and the different colors that we have in the score.

308
00:22:06,572 --> 00:22:14,634
As you can see in red there's some taiko there, in blue there is some Japanese soloist instruments,

309
00:22:14,634 --> 00:22:21,656
and in green and yellow there we have orchestras, strings and brass there.

310
00:22:21,656 --> 00:22:28,178
But if you look closely at the bottom, there are stems that are muted. There's actually a label

311
00:22:28,178 --> 00:22:33,260
here that is too small you can't see, but it's actually called the additional soloist stem.

312
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,960
So what are these really?

313
00:22:35,527 --> 00:22:37,508
Let's talk about that for a little bit.

314
00:22:37,508 --> 00:22:41,351
And this is the last continent of recording that we did,

315
00:22:41,351 --> 00:22:44,613
actually, which is in our home soil in the US

316
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:48,576
and completes the three continental recording thing.

317
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:54,541
So first of all, why did that need to be done?

318
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:57,703
Like I said earlier, the iterative process

319
00:22:57,703 --> 00:23:00,745
and how we tackle the iteration is very important.

320
00:23:01,624 --> 00:23:08,028
As we played the game, we realized that the game is way bigger than we thought. There's more content

321
00:23:08,028 --> 00:23:14,451
and with the player's free agency to go do anything, you end up spending more time in

322
00:23:14,451 --> 00:23:19,735
the game in general, which is a great thing. But we find that systemically,

323
00:23:19,735 --> 00:23:26,859
it's getting tiring after a while. We don't have enough content to provide

324
00:23:26,859 --> 00:23:30,662
variety in the music, especially in the Japanese instruments.

325
00:23:32,026 --> 00:23:40,431
Next thing is also that the game's minimalistic approach also means that the orchestra has to be used sparingly.

326
00:23:40,431 --> 00:23:49,536
And we'll show the example of this in a second, but essentially if we use the orchestra all the time, it becomes a wall of sound and noise at some point.

327
00:23:49,536 --> 00:24:00,483
So because we pick and choose our moments, we ended up using more Japanese soloists than the orchestras, and that means we run out of content really quickly.

328
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:08,492
Now how we tackled that was we needed to get this done kind of quickly and in very specific ways

329
00:24:08,492 --> 00:24:14,513
because we were running against the deadline and we really needed to do something functional so we

330
00:24:14,513 --> 00:24:19,594
couldn't go really go back to Japan again. So we utilized first and second generation

331
00:24:19,594 --> 00:24:27,895
Japanese talents in Los Angeles and that is Kozue Matsumoto on Kodo, Ko Umezaki on Shakuhachi,

332
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:36,558
Shoji Kamada on Taiko and then not Japanese but Mike Penney is a shamisen player who's

333
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:43,405
competed in Japan, become one of the very few non-Japanese to have won shamisen competitions

334
00:24:43,405 --> 00:24:48,210
over there. He's very much involved within that community, can speak Japanese as well.

335
00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:54,543
And lastly we have a solo cello recording as well. And if you can see this group really quickly,

336
00:24:54,543 --> 00:25:00,548
you're starting to see like a really functional quintet, almost like a band that can kind of play

337
00:25:00,548 --> 00:25:07,433
their own music. And with this, I have decided that we're going to build upon existing pieces

338
00:25:07,433 --> 00:25:13,958
of music. And by existing pieces of music, this is specifically Ilan Eshgeri's combat music.

339
00:25:16,273 --> 00:25:21,656
We know what we're missing now from playtesting the music in the game, and we've done a few

340
00:25:21,656 --> 00:25:27,078
iterations of the implementation, tried different ways, and we know now that what kind of content

341
00:25:27,078 --> 00:25:33,020
was missing, which is that kind of the medium intensity level of combat, where like we can go

342
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:37,742
really light, we can go really big with the orchestra, but what's going to be there in the

343
00:25:37,742 --> 00:25:44,845
middle? And with this, we employ kind of the combination of written parts of improvisation.

344
00:25:45,609 --> 00:25:51,452
By written parts I mean that we might be literally doubling the orchestral parts of this quintet

345
00:25:51,452 --> 00:25:58,575
and at the same time making kind of almost like an alternate arrangement instead of playing the

346
00:25:58,575 --> 00:26:06,320
full orchestra. We'll now play using this small five-piece band that we put together to play

347
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,700
and execute that arrangement.

348
00:26:08,471 --> 00:26:14,635
And that with some improvisation, we've really provided even more Japanese colors

349
00:26:14,635 --> 00:26:17,676
that can play with the track or play on its own as well.

350
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:25,541
So with this, we came up with a very target recording plans. There are some parts that

351
00:26:25,541 --> 00:26:29,884
are written. There are some free form improvisation that's set to be played

352
00:26:29,884 --> 00:26:34,406
with a certain track. Let's look at how the recording went down. Here's Ko.

353
00:26:35,192 --> 00:26:43,818
Kozue and then Mike Penny. We did it all here at PlayStation Studios. We brought them in and then

354
00:26:43,818 --> 00:26:50,443
each of them spent a day with us. And then we also went to Capitol Studios in Hollywood to

355
00:26:50,443 --> 00:26:55,487
record some Taikos. We ended up using a lot of this for Legends Mode, which is

356
00:26:55,487 --> 00:27:00,711
the multiplayer expansion that came out a few months after the game released.

357
00:27:02,241 --> 00:27:07,485
Alright, now that you've heard a lot and seen a lot of wall of text and a lot of what I did,

358
00:27:07,485 --> 00:27:14,090
let's actually hear what I did. So first example here is I want to play

359
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:20,835
a minimalistic scoring cinematic that I've been talking about, about how we're saving the

360
00:27:20,835 --> 00:27:27,720
orchestra and we have just very few Japanese instruments. We use a free time approach and

361
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,222
we use some silence to create some tension. Let's see what this sounds like.

362
00:27:44,163 --> 00:28:04,415
That's really great.

363
00:28:04,415 --> 00:28:09,078
You can see that with so little, they're probably only like

364
00:28:09,741 --> 00:28:15,006
five, six musical gestures in there. Here's some shakuhachi, some koto. But with so little,

365
00:28:15,006 --> 00:28:21,832
we can create so much tension and focus as well as immersing the players in the Japanese aesthetic.

366
00:28:21,832 --> 00:28:27,497
This is something that we used a lot throughout the game. But now let's look at the stark contrast

367
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:27,918
of that.

368
00:28:28,703 --> 00:28:42,547
Here we have a scene, a very important story moment where Jin is announcing that he's embracing and fully becoming the ghost rather than being adopted as Shimura-san

369
00:28:42,547 --> 00:28:56,150
And this is one of the really bigger moments where we've used the orchestras to really give some weight to the scene and make it even more gut-wrenching than it was. Let's hear that.

370
00:28:58,463 --> 00:29:01,885
Renounce the ghost.

371
00:29:01,885 --> 00:29:09,348
You must blame her for this outrage.

372
00:29:09,348 --> 00:29:19,212
Tell them you are Jin Xingru, loyal servant to the Shogun.

373
00:29:19,212 --> 00:29:23,594
My heir.

374
00:29:23,594 --> 00:29:24,014
My son.

375
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:32,317
I am not your son.

376
00:29:32,317 --> 00:29:45,625
I am the ghost.

377
00:29:45,625 --> 00:29:58,333
And you will be judged for it.

378
00:29:58,333 --> 00:30:00,995
Find the Khan.

379
00:30:01,681 --> 00:30:03,758
Taka go

380
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:43,805
You can just see how much weight the orchestra can actually give a scene like this and what a stark contrast it is to a previous scene and how effective it is to not hear this so often but when it comes in you really do feel that this story moment is very special.

381
00:30:43,805 --> 00:30:45,306
And a lot of the game...

382
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:53,457
is this balancing act between having the minimalistic Japanese aesthetic, just like how

383
00:30:53,457 --> 00:31:00,123
the Sucker Punch brief came to us, as well as having an epic grand tale of the samurai story

384
00:31:00,123 --> 00:31:06,008
that is very emotional to the player. Now up next is some custom arrangements and this is

385
00:31:06,008 --> 00:31:08,650
really interesting because

386
00:31:09,595 --> 00:31:15,177
It's utilizing the additional soloists that we talked about earlier.

387
00:31:15,177 --> 00:31:22,800
Here in this Ronin duo, you will hear Ilan's combat music, but arranged slightly differently,

388
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:27,241
where we have thinned down the taiko to use a smaller taiko.

389
00:31:28,036 --> 00:31:34,997
as well as instead of using the orchestra we use the solo cello to play the ostinato groove along

390
00:31:34,997 --> 00:31:40,559
with the shamisen and the shakuhachi peppering on top and the special thing about this is you can

391
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:46,740
hear mike penney shredding on the shamisen which we did not plan for when we were recording but

392
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:52,081
he was just kind of playing during one of the breaks and we were just like let's record that

393
00:31:52,081 --> 00:31:55,542
and this became this ronin duo here let's watch that

394
00:32:16,897 --> 00:32:38,215
Ryuzo's stories don't do you justice.

395
00:32:38,215 --> 00:32:42,558
They never did.

396
00:33:19,782 --> 00:33:24,745
If you play the game, you notice that this is somewhat like you hear something that's kind of

397
00:33:24,745 --> 00:33:30,448
familiar because you've heard this combat music elsewhere in your normal combat with the mongol,

398
00:33:30,448 --> 00:33:35,972
but because of this different custom arrangement, it has really made this duo have a life of its own

399
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:42,576
and really feel special to the player. Now lastly, I want to give a little bit of an intro on the

400
00:33:42,576 --> 00:33:47,218
systemic music before I hand it over to Andrew. And this is

401
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:54,723
the exploration mood system that I was talking about earlier, but the exploration itself,

402
00:33:54,723 --> 00:33:59,805
it is one state out of the many states of our much larger open world system. But I will be

403
00:33:59,805 --> 00:34:04,588
focusing on just the exploration part for now, and then like I said, Andrew will take us through the rest.

404
00:34:05,945 --> 00:34:12,430
So we've gone through a lot of iterations of how do we want the players to feel if they're just

405
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:17,674
walking in exploration mode and explore the world. There's got to be a little bit of

406
00:34:17,674 --> 00:34:25,340
this tranquility and serenity of the Tsushima Island, but as well as immersing you in this

407
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:31,525
Japanese samurai fantasy, making you really feel like you're in feudal Japan. Again, just trying to

408
00:34:31,525 --> 00:34:33,346
execute a sucker punch's brief.

409
00:34:34,254 --> 00:34:42,278
So what we came up with was kind of these multiple playlists of short musical segments that will play

410
00:34:42,278 --> 00:34:47,580
depending on your location, time of day, and progression. Let's actually just look

411
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:51,082
go ahead and look at this video which will help demonstrate this even further.

412
00:35:13,417 --> 00:35:13,862
you

413
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:57,565
You can hear there there's kind of these paddy strings that have been time stretched and have

414
00:35:57,565 --> 00:36:04,552
been processed with reverb in such a way that they sound like their own thing, then peppered in with

415
00:36:04,552 --> 00:36:11,558
some Japanese soloists like what we recorded earlier with the additional soloist stems, and then

416
00:36:12,369 --> 00:36:17,972
with the variety of the states we have, you could walk around in this world for 30 hours, 60 hours,

417
00:36:17,972 --> 00:36:24,774
and you'll never get tired of this exploration music. It's really become one of the things I

418
00:36:24,774 --> 00:36:30,417
personally really enjoy playing the game, just to hear this explore music. And that wraps up my

419
00:36:30,417 --> 00:36:37,360
section of it. Like I said, this is a much bigger system, and the next up part of it, which is

420
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:41,162
what we call the Music Encounter System, will be touched upon by Andrew Buresh.

421
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:49,477
Thanks, Bill. So we've heard a little bit about how the music for Ghost of Tsushima was conceived and recorded.

422
00:36:49,477 --> 00:36:57,401
We've heard about, you know, some of the cool custom arrangements that we put together for some of the story-based content in the game.

423
00:36:57,401 --> 00:37:02,344
But what about the open world? Ghost of Tsushima is an open world game after all.

424
00:37:02,664 --> 00:37:10,075
And while we would like to go through and hand score every single encounter you can possibly get into in the game, you just can't do it.

425
00:37:10,075 --> 00:37:13,620
There's not enough hours in the in the world to to do that.

426
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,483
So we need to build a system.

427
00:37:16,435 --> 00:37:19,458
that can understand what's happening at any point in the game

428
00:37:19,458 --> 00:37:23,602
and scale the music appropriately for the action that's on screen.

429
00:37:23,602 --> 00:37:27,866
So for Ghost of Tsushima, we call that system the Music Encounter System.

430
00:37:27,866 --> 00:37:31,689
It's on by default. It can be overridden when necessary.

431
00:37:31,689 --> 00:37:35,132
And it's responsible for scoring the bulk of the open world experiences

432
00:37:35,132 --> 00:37:39,596
you're having in the game and even a lot of the story based experiences as well.

433
00:37:39,596 --> 00:37:41,758
So how does this system work?

434
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:47,175
Well, it consists of a number of different states.

435
00:37:47,175 --> 00:37:51,220
These states are changed based on a couple of different criteria

436
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:54,284
from the game, namely the distance between Jin

437
00:37:54,284 --> 00:37:57,127
and any nearby enemies and the awareness

438
00:37:57,127 --> 00:37:59,190
states of those enemies.

439
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:01,593
Now, looking at this flowchart on screen,

440
00:38:01,593 --> 00:38:03,055
if we read it from left to right.

441
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:07,242
Explorer would be the least intense music in the system.

442
00:38:07,242 --> 00:38:09,346
Combat would be the most intense.

443
00:38:09,346 --> 00:38:11,691
And as you go from left and right through the flow chart,

444
00:38:11,691 --> 00:38:14,597
the music increases in intensity on the way to combat.

445
00:38:15,437 --> 00:38:22,122
Each of these states has a playlist associated with it in Wwise, and each playlist consists

446
00:38:22,122 --> 00:38:27,566
of a number of chunks, what we call musical chunks, that can be played back in any order

447
00:38:27,566 --> 00:38:32,529
and are edited in a way to where that can play seamlessly without you ever knowing and

448
00:38:32,529 --> 00:38:36,912
we can get these variety of arrangements as we hear the music playback in game.

449
00:38:37,612 --> 00:38:43,217
And this is super important because we only have four Music Encounter System cues that were written

450
00:38:43,217 --> 00:38:48,681
for the game, and we need to make sure that we have enough variety in here along with the help

451
00:38:48,681 --> 00:38:52,825
of the soloist material that Bill was talking about earlier, so we're not hearing things

452
00:38:52,825 --> 00:38:56,868
repeating too often and that the player isn't getting bored of what they're hearing in the

453
00:38:56,868 --> 00:38:57,368
background.

454
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:01,653
So let's walk through these states here one by one.

455
00:39:01,653 --> 00:39:03,675
The first state is explore.

456
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:04,736
Bill touched on this earlier.

457
00:39:04,736 --> 00:39:06,477
It's the default state of the system.

458
00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:08,479
It's what plays when you're just exploring

459
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:12,822
around the island unencumbered by any enemy encounters.

460
00:39:12,822 --> 00:39:17,686
The next state approach is our first state that's

461
00:39:17,686 --> 00:39:19,087
changed based on distance.

462
00:39:19,597 --> 00:39:24,440
So if any enemy comes within 50 meters of Jin, we'll change to approach.

463
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:29,083
And we don't play any specific music in approach. It's really more of a buffer state

464
00:39:29,083 --> 00:39:33,066
between Explorer and the more combat-oriented states in the system.

465
00:39:33,066 --> 00:39:36,248
Any Explorer music that was playing will allow to play out.

466
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:40,551
And maybe more importantly, we make sure no new Explorer music starts playing.

467
00:39:40,551 --> 00:39:45,874
This fixes a problem I've wrestled with on previous systems I've built for other games.

468
00:39:46,272 --> 00:39:48,754
where we know we're near some enemy encounter,

469
00:39:48,754 --> 00:39:52,056
but not close enough to trigger the music for that encounter.

470
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:54,498
And just as you're about to enter,

471
00:39:54,498 --> 00:39:56,960
this beautiful piece of Explorer music starts playing.

472
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,542
And just as it's welling up, it gets

473
00:39:58,542 --> 00:40:00,163
interrupted by the combat music.

474
00:40:00,163 --> 00:40:03,306
And I just wanted a way to control that from happening.

475
00:40:03,306 --> 00:40:07,089
So we implemented this approach state in between.

476
00:40:07,089 --> 00:40:09,571
Before we go on, I want to take a closer look

477
00:40:09,571 --> 00:40:12,133
at how we are measuring these distances in game

478
00:40:12,133 --> 00:40:14,255
and deciding when to change between approach.

479
00:40:14,624 --> 00:40:18,126
and infiltrate, which is another distance-based state.

480
00:40:18,126 --> 00:40:22,328
So on screen here is a screen capture from the game

481
00:40:22,328 --> 00:40:23,709
with our debug display up.

482
00:40:23,709 --> 00:40:26,651
I've highlighted some of the debug circles,

483
00:40:26,651 --> 00:40:29,032
so they're a little more visible on screen.

484
00:40:29,032 --> 00:40:31,294
But you can see we have Jin here in the middle,

485
00:40:31,294 --> 00:40:34,456
and then he has four concentric circles drawn out around him.

486
00:40:34,456 --> 00:40:38,138
And these are the radii, the distances

487
00:40:38,138 --> 00:40:40,760
at which we are choosing to change states for approach

488
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,581
and infiltrate.

489
00:40:42,581 --> 00:40:43,722
So here's just another view of it.

490
00:40:45,505 --> 00:40:46,785
So you might be asking yourself,

491
00:40:46,785 --> 00:40:48,906
well, why are there four circles here?

492
00:40:48,906 --> 00:40:50,046
Shouldn't there just be one?

493
00:40:50,046 --> 00:40:51,826
You just need the one line to know

494
00:40:51,826 --> 00:40:54,627
whether we're in the state or out of the state.

495
00:40:54,627 --> 00:40:55,907
And this solves an issue,

496
00:40:55,907 --> 00:40:58,908
I'm sure we've all run into playing other open world games.

497
00:40:58,908 --> 00:41:01,489
You're sneaking up to an enemy area,

498
00:41:01,489 --> 00:41:03,949
the tense encounter music starts playing.

499
00:41:03,949 --> 00:41:06,530
You sneak away a little bit, it stops playing.

500
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:09,030
You sneak a little closer, it starts playing again.

501
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:10,791
And you can sort of play with this system,

502
00:41:10,791 --> 00:41:11,751
turning it on and off,

503
00:41:11,751 --> 00:41:13,711
listening as it's ping ponging back and forth

504
00:41:13,711 --> 00:41:14,612
between states.

505
00:41:15,192 --> 00:41:18,173
In this case, there's one invisible line that's saying,

506
00:41:18,173 --> 00:41:19,633
on this side, we're playing the music,

507
00:41:19,633 --> 00:41:22,294
on this side, we're not playing the music.

508
00:41:22,294 --> 00:41:25,795
And we wanted to avoid this for Ghost of Tsushima.

509
00:41:25,795 --> 00:41:29,216
So we ended up implementing two different radii

510
00:41:29,216 --> 00:41:32,257
for each of the states infiltrate and approach.

511
00:41:32,257 --> 00:41:36,799
One sets the state and a different one removes the state.

512
00:41:36,799 --> 00:41:40,440
So let's take a look at this in the case of approach.

513
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,861
As I said, we set approach if an enemy comes

514
00:41:42,861 --> 00:41:44,461
within 50 meters of Jin.

515
00:41:44,461 --> 00:41:44,521
So.

516
00:41:45,115 --> 00:41:47,945
We see we have our Mongol enemy there in the bottom left.

517
00:41:47,945 --> 00:41:50,053
He's outside of the outer circles.

518
00:41:50,053 --> 00:41:51,057
So we're in Explore.

519
00:41:51,638 --> 00:41:57,481
if he moves within 50 meters of Jin, so inside that inner yellow circle, that's when we'll change

520
00:41:57,481 --> 00:42:03,585
to approach. Now to change back from approach to explore, that same mongol would have to move 60

521
00:42:03,585 --> 00:42:10,149
meters away from Jin. So we have this 10 meter buffer between the radii, and we've now eliminated

522
00:42:10,149 --> 00:42:16,353
that ping-ponging issue where somebody could find that line and walk back and forth across it,

523
00:42:16,353 --> 00:42:17,694
changing the music really quickly.

524
00:42:18,374 --> 00:42:25,379
and we really feel like this helps smooth out any musical anomalies in our music system.

525
00:42:25,379 --> 00:42:28,261
So back to our flowchart here, we're in approach.

526
00:42:28,261 --> 00:42:36,207
The next state in the system would be infiltrate. So that's another distance-based change, so

527
00:42:36,207 --> 00:42:40,110
a Mongol enemy has to come within 20 meters of Jin to change to infiltrate.

528
00:42:40,819 --> 00:42:44,165
So back to our visual representation here, we've got our Mongol.

529
00:42:44,165 --> 00:42:45,527
He's outside the zone.

530
00:42:45,527 --> 00:42:48,493
He would have to move inside the innermost circle,

531
00:42:48,493 --> 00:42:50,336
20 meters from Jen, to change to infiltrate.

532
00:42:52,122 --> 00:42:59,007
Now, content wise for Infiltrate, we're really trying to stay true to that minimalistic scoring approach Bill mentioned earlier.

533
00:42:59,007 --> 00:43:03,850
You're really only going to hear a couple of elements at any one time in Infiltrate.

534
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:05,992
They're going to be tense and sneaky.

535
00:43:05,992 --> 00:43:09,554
We've got lots of space built into this playlist.

536
00:43:09,554 --> 00:43:13,036
And that's all to stay with that minimal approach.

537
00:43:13,036 --> 00:43:17,019
We really don't want to beat the player over the head with musical material here.

538
00:43:17,019 --> 00:43:19,721
You're going to be hearing the state very often.

539
00:43:19,721 --> 00:43:21,622
So we try and keep things rather sparse.

540
00:43:22,102 --> 00:43:26,285
And I've got an audio example here for Infiltrate, so let's listen to what that sounds like.

541
00:43:58,846 --> 00:44:05,912
So that's infiltrate, you know, really sort of sets that mood of of sneaky infiltration as Mongols are nearby.

542
00:44:05,912 --> 00:44:13,059
So the next state. Well, actually, before I go there, there's there's two places where infiltrate can go from here.

543
00:44:13,059 --> 00:44:16,462
First would be standoff. This would be if a player.

544
00:44:16,882 --> 00:44:19,042
entered into a standoff with a nearby enemy.

545
00:44:19,042 --> 00:44:21,683
We're not gonna dive too much into this today.

546
00:44:21,683 --> 00:44:24,404
Suffice to say that it exists, it has its own music,

547
00:44:24,404 --> 00:44:26,825
but we're gonna move on to the next state

548
00:44:26,825 --> 00:44:30,126
in the system itself, which is alarmed.

549
00:44:30,126 --> 00:44:33,468
Now, this state changes based on the awareness level

550
00:44:33,468 --> 00:44:36,669
of the enemies in the encounter area.

551
00:44:36,669 --> 00:44:38,750
An enemy will go into an alarm state

552
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:40,490
if they have a sense that there's a threat nearby,

553
00:44:40,490 --> 00:44:43,931
but they haven't really identified where it is yet.

554
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:46,252
Maybe they've heard Jen running around through a camp.

555
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:51,302
Maybe they found a body in a yurt somewhere or you fired an arrow and missed your shot.

556
00:44:51,302 --> 00:44:55,184
They know somebody is around, but they want to go and search and find where they are.

557
00:44:55,184 --> 00:45:02,147
This heightened level of search that an enemy might go into causes a change in the music as well.

558
00:45:02,827 --> 00:45:08,633
Content wise, we're still staying rather sparse here, but we will add a few more elements,

559
00:45:08,633 --> 00:45:13,257
remove some of that space that might have been an infiltrate, add some more rhythmic elements,

560
00:45:13,257 --> 00:45:18,322
just to up the excitement for this change in awareness in the Mongols that are in the area.

561
00:45:18,322 --> 00:45:21,565
So I've got an audio example here of alarm that we can listen to.

562
00:45:49,843 --> 00:45:52,665
Cool, so ups the excitement just a little bit,

563
00:45:52,665 --> 00:45:54,966
but still that sparse minimal approach.

564
00:45:54,966 --> 00:45:58,889
So the next state in our system would be combat.

565
00:45:58,889 --> 00:46:01,850
We changed to combat when the enemies are fully aware

566
00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:06,233
of Jin, they are actively engaged in combat with him.

567
00:46:06,233 --> 00:46:09,215
Now, combat is a fair bit more complex

568
00:46:09,215 --> 00:46:11,756
than the rest of the states in the system.

569
00:46:11,756 --> 00:46:13,837
Right off the bat, you can see we have it divided

570
00:46:13,837 --> 00:46:17,059
into two intensities, combat hard and combat easy.

571
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:22,781
Now we're picking which intensity of combat to play based on the perceived difficulty of the

572
00:46:22,781 --> 00:46:28,063
encounter that Jin's in. I'm going to talk a little more about this in a few slides, but if

573
00:46:28,063 --> 00:46:33,405
the encounter is less difficult, we'll play combat easy. If it's more difficult, we'll play combat hard.

574
00:46:34,145 --> 00:46:53,058
And a big goal we had for combat was to have very smooth and musical transitions between the states. And we achieve this a number of different ways. First off, we have specific transitions for going between easy and hard, whether you're going up from easy to hard or down from hard to easy.

575
00:46:53,058 --> 00:46:57,300
Additionally, we have special combat easy chunks that we call easy plus.

576
00:46:57,907 --> 00:47:01,547
that will play after a combat hard down transition.

577
00:47:01,547 --> 00:47:04,088
And this just gives a really smooth transition

578
00:47:04,088 --> 00:47:05,408
when coming down.

579
00:47:05,408 --> 00:47:08,469
We want the player to feel the difference in the music,

580
00:47:08,469 --> 00:47:12,510
but we don't want it to be that hard ping pong-y change.

581
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:15,531
In addition to those special transitions,

582
00:47:15,531 --> 00:47:19,032
we're also using custom cue markers and Ys.

583
00:47:19,032 --> 00:47:22,532
So instead of saying, okay, transition on the next beat

584
00:47:22,532 --> 00:47:25,173
or the next bar, we've actually gone through

585
00:47:25,173 --> 00:47:26,673
each combat chunk in the game.

586
00:47:27,137 --> 00:47:32,120
and handpicked where we think the most musically opportune places are to transition.

587
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:36,422
The big goals here are we don't want to interrupt any big sweeping melodies,

588
00:47:36,422 --> 00:47:38,122
especially in the hard combat chunks.

589
00:47:38,122 --> 00:47:46,526
And we also want to make sure any grooves that we leave are left at the most opportune moments.

590
00:47:46,526 --> 00:47:51,488
So I have a musical example here to play for combat hard and easy.

591
00:47:51,488 --> 00:47:52,709
It's a little bit longer.

592
00:47:52,709 --> 00:47:55,350
I can walk you through now and I'll annotate while we play through.

593
00:47:55,350 --> 00:47:56,751
But we start in alarms.

594
00:47:57,854 --> 00:48:01,798
We move up to Combat Easy, transition up to Combat Hard,

595
00:48:01,798 --> 00:48:03,280
and then transition back down.

596
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,762
And I'll try and call out those changes as they happen.

597
00:48:05,762 --> 00:48:07,364
So we'll start in Alarmed here.

598
00:48:07,364 --> 00:48:19,236
Now we're transitioning to Combat Easy.

599
00:48:34,739 --> 00:48:36,137
Up to combat hard.

600
00:49:33,758 --> 00:49:38,284
Great. And I did want to touch on the content that we have in each of these playlists.

601
00:49:38,284 --> 00:49:43,330
So Combat Easy is more of that minimalist approach.

602
00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:47,516
We're kind of falling back on that quintet Bill was talking about of the more Japanese

603
00:49:47,516 --> 00:49:51,120
traditional instruments, maybe the smaller taiko ensembles.

604
00:49:51,432 --> 00:49:55,076
perhaps solo cello instead of a full string section,

605
00:49:55,076 --> 00:49:57,017
whereas combat hard will be a little denser.

606
00:49:57,017 --> 00:49:59,960
We'll have those full orchestral sections playing together,

607
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:02,843
the large taiko ensembles, all the big drums,

608
00:50:02,843 --> 00:50:05,525
which really gives us that difference in intensity

609
00:50:05,525 --> 00:50:07,467
to play with when playing in combat.

610
00:50:07,467 --> 00:50:08,708
So we're not just hitting the player

611
00:50:08,708 --> 00:50:11,291
with the same combat music every time.

612
00:50:11,291 --> 00:50:12,932
Just gives us that variety to play with.

613
00:50:14,095 --> 00:50:18,840
And finally, rather self-explanatory, we've got our combat end tag.

614
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:22,944
This will transition us out of our combat material into one of the lower states,

615
00:50:22,944 --> 00:50:24,886
depending on how you've exited.

616
00:50:24,886 --> 00:50:28,209
If you've killed all the enemies, we'll go back to explore.

617
00:50:28,209 --> 00:50:31,852
If you've just snuck away, we might go back to infiltrate or alarmed

618
00:50:31,852 --> 00:50:32,993
if there are enemies still around.

619
00:50:34,193 --> 00:50:39,317
And I wanted to circle back, we saw a slide earlier in Bill's presentation of the wide

620
00:50:39,317 --> 00:50:42,099
stems of screenshot from Pro Tools.

621
00:50:42,099 --> 00:50:46,762
This is what that same Pro Tools session looks like after our editors have edited everything

622
00:50:46,762 --> 00:50:49,143
for one of these music encounter systems.

623
00:50:49,143 --> 00:50:54,467
So this has all of the infiltrate chunks, all the alarm chunks, all the combat easy

624
00:50:54,467 --> 00:50:59,170
and hard, all the transitions, and you can really see the level of detail we're going

625
00:50:59,170 --> 00:50:59,390
to.

626
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:03,953
And using every one of those stems, making all sorts of different alt arrangements.

627
00:51:04,487 --> 00:51:09,952
Again, just really trying to make as much variety as we can to make it an interesting

628
00:51:09,952 --> 00:51:16,297
listening experience for the player. So I wanted to talk more about encounter

629
00:51:16,297 --> 00:51:23,763
difficulty in Ghost of Tsushima, how we are calculating it and even how it's changing

630
00:51:23,763 --> 00:51:28,126
as you play through the game. Being an open world game,

631
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:32,650
the player has free agency to go wherever they want, engage with content however they want.

632
00:51:33,195 --> 00:51:37,137
And there can be a specific issue inherent in this that we've noticed on the PlayStation

633
00:51:37,137 --> 00:51:41,739
music team and we were able to fix on Ghost of Tsushima. And that is that, you know, somebody

634
00:51:41,739 --> 00:51:47,022
might play three quarters of the way through the game and then come back to an area around

635
00:51:47,022 --> 00:51:49,603
where they started fighting some easier enemies.

636
00:51:49,823 --> 00:51:55,567
well, they're all leveled up. They have all sorts of weapon upgrades, more XP. They just know the

637
00:51:55,567 --> 00:52:00,390
game better. Those early encounters that you might run into are going to be a lot easier for those

638
00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:04,633
players. They're not going to take as long. They're not going to feel as dangerous. And we wanted to

639
00:52:04,633 --> 00:52:10,476
be able to scale the combat music that would play for those situations. So we asked ourselves,

640
00:52:10,476 --> 00:52:15,720
how do we tell how difficult a particular encounter is for one player versus another,

641
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:17,261
depending on where they're at in the game?

642
00:52:17,982 --> 00:52:22,006
And we came up with this equation that I'm going to walk through here.

643
00:52:22,006 --> 00:52:28,011
So the first part of the equation, the sum of the encounter enemy values.

644
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:33,676
Well, we started out by asking Sucker Punch for a list of the enemy types that were in the game.

645
00:52:33,676 --> 00:52:36,018
And we got this roughly this list back.

646
00:52:36,018 --> 00:52:39,161
You can see we have a number of different tribes.

647
00:52:39,801 --> 00:52:43,623
Essentially, those tribes from one to five, that denotes difficulty.

648
00:52:43,623 --> 00:52:47,906
You would have seen this as the color of outfits that the Mongols were wearing in the game.

649
00:52:47,906 --> 00:52:52,429
Tribe one Mongols were much easier to defeat than tribe five.

650
00:52:52,429 --> 00:52:55,551
And then within those tribes, we've got different enemy types.

651
00:52:55,551 --> 00:53:00,734
Melees are your grunt enemies, ranged are your archers or enemies who throw things.

652
00:53:01,014 --> 00:53:05,095
the heavy enemies were the big brutes who were a lot harder to take out.

653
00:53:05,095 --> 00:53:10,236
We also have bandits, ronin, samurai, animals, and we wanted to go through and assign a number

654
00:53:10,236 --> 00:53:15,178
value to each one of these enemy types. And you can see we've done that here in this table.

655
00:53:15,178 --> 00:53:20,379
And roughly as the tribes get more difficult, that number goes up.

656
00:53:20,379 --> 00:53:24,220
And what happens when you get into an encounter is we look at how many

657
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:27,361
enemies are involved. We compare against this list.

658
00:53:27,689 --> 00:53:38,237
Okay, we look at the intensity values for those enemies and we add those together to give a sense of you know how how difficult or what's going on in this encounter enemy wise.

659
00:53:38,237 --> 00:53:42,461
You can see, next we then divide by a number we call the hero factor.

660
00:53:43,618 --> 00:53:46,739
Now the hero factor is the key to this equation.

661
00:53:46,739 --> 00:53:48,920
We did a lot of work trying to figure out

662
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:52,521
how we were going to track how strong or how powerful

663
00:53:52,521 --> 00:53:55,942
Jin was to give us this idea of how easy or hard

664
00:53:55,942 --> 00:53:56,782
an encounter might be.

665
00:53:56,782 --> 00:53:58,383
And we landed on this hero factor.

666
00:53:58,383 --> 00:54:01,544
Now the hero factor is a number we only

667
00:54:01,544 --> 00:54:04,165
use for the music system itself.

668
00:54:04,165 --> 00:54:07,506
But it's based on a parameter from the game

669
00:54:07,506 --> 00:54:09,806
that we got from Sucker Punch called hero level.

670
00:54:10,547 --> 00:54:16,212
Now this is an under the hood number in Ghost of Tsushima. I don't think you the player ever

671
00:54:16,212 --> 00:54:22,177
see this anywhere in the game, but roughly it tracks along with the XP that you're gaining

672
00:54:22,177 --> 00:54:26,761
as you are completing missions, completing side content, getting different upgrades,

673
00:54:26,761 --> 00:54:31,746
different armor, so it gives us a sense of how strong Jin might be as he progresses.

674
00:54:32,866 --> 00:54:47,898
But you'll see hero level it starts at zero and it goes up to up to 10. So there's 11 levels there, and that zero to 10 split just made the math really difficult to work with and really unwieldy and kind of hard to hone things into a place that made sense.

675
00:54:47,898 --> 00:54:53,603
So right off the bat we knew we'd have to convert this into some other set of numbers and that's how we ended up with the hero factor.

676
00:54:54,264 --> 00:54:55,885
So you see hero level goes from 0 to 10.

677
00:54:55,885 --> 00:54:59,727
Our hero factor actually goes from 1 to 2.

678
00:54:59,727 --> 00:55:04,731
Much simpler to deal with in this equation, especially.

679
00:55:05,973 --> 00:55:08,554
We have our enemy encounter values,

680
00:55:08,554 --> 00:55:10,996
we divide by our hero factor, and that

681
00:55:10,996 --> 00:55:13,678
gives us a rough sense of the encounter difficulty.

682
00:55:13,678 --> 00:55:16,339
If we compare that to some combat thresholds

683
00:55:16,339 --> 00:55:18,381
that we've set, we can tell, OK, is this

684
00:55:18,381 --> 00:55:21,062
a hard encounter for this player,

685
00:55:21,062 --> 00:55:24,144
or is this an easy one, and then play specific combat music

686
00:55:24,144 --> 00:55:28,107
based on that result. So let's walk through an example here.

687
00:55:29,108 --> 00:55:30,649
We've got our equation.

688
00:55:30,649 --> 00:55:33,150
Let's imagine we're early in the game.

689
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:36,592
We're just fighting a few tribe one Mongols on the road,

690
00:55:36,592 --> 00:55:38,813
say two tribe one melee enemies

691
00:55:38,813 --> 00:55:40,133
who have an intensity value of 12,

692
00:55:40,133 --> 00:55:42,714
two tribe one ranged enemies

693
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:45,896
who have an intensity value of eight.

694
00:55:45,896 --> 00:55:47,076
So two and two of each of those,

695
00:55:47,076 --> 00:55:50,298
we have 12 plus 12 plus eight plus eight

696
00:55:50,298 --> 00:55:51,698
gives us an enemy value of 40.

697
00:55:53,162 --> 00:55:55,422
Now, like I said, we are early in the game.

698
00:55:55,422 --> 00:55:56,802
Imagine we're just starting out.

699
00:55:56,802 --> 00:55:58,823
So we haven't really done anything.

700
00:55:58,823 --> 00:56:00,003
We're hero level zero.

701
00:56:00,003 --> 00:56:04,484
We can see this pertains to the hero factor of one.

702
00:56:04,484 --> 00:56:05,404
So we plug that in.

703
00:56:05,404 --> 00:56:09,225
We now have enemy value 40 divided by hero factor of one.

704
00:56:09,225 --> 00:56:13,046
Gives us an encounter difficulty of 40.

705
00:56:13,046 --> 00:56:13,646
Okay, that's cool.

706
00:56:13,646 --> 00:56:14,926
But what does this mean?

707
00:56:14,926 --> 00:56:16,547
We need to compare it against something,

708
00:56:16,547 --> 00:56:18,467
against our combat thresholds.

709
00:56:19,409 --> 00:56:21,772
So we see we have our thresholds here.

710
00:56:21,772 --> 00:56:26,058
Anything from 10 to 29 would be easy combat.

711
00:56:26,058 --> 00:56:29,263
And it's worth saying anything that is below 10

712
00:56:29,263 --> 00:56:31,526
would get no combat music.

713
00:56:31,526 --> 00:56:33,469
We do have that option in our system.

714
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:40,836
anything 30 and above would be hard combat. So in this example we have here as a player just

715
00:56:40,836 --> 00:56:47,483
starting out, this encounter of 40 would trigger hard combat and rightfully so. You're just starting

716
00:56:47,483 --> 00:56:52,288
out, you're not as leveled up, that encounter is going to be more difficult, it's going to

717
00:56:52,288 --> 00:56:55,992
take you longer, and it warrants that more bombastic arrangement of combat.

718
00:56:57,483 --> 00:57:00,486
How does this change if we were somebody who finished the game

719
00:57:00,486 --> 00:57:03,909
and then came back to the same area to clear out some content?

720
00:57:03,909 --> 00:57:06,191
Well, the math changes drastically.

721
00:57:06,191 --> 00:57:09,254
If we imagine that you're hero level 10, the highest level

722
00:57:09,254 --> 00:57:12,817
you can be, that turns into a hero factor of 2.

723
00:57:12,817 --> 00:57:15,260
So now we're taking that enemy value of 40

724
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:16,641
and we're cutting it in half.

725
00:57:16,641 --> 00:57:19,304
Now the encounter difficulty is 20 instead of 40.

726
00:57:19,304 --> 00:57:21,346
While comparing to our thresholds,

727
00:57:22,757 --> 00:57:24,959
we're only getting above that easy threshold now.

728
00:57:24,959 --> 00:57:29,464
So this same encounter, being engaged

729
00:57:29,464 --> 00:57:32,407
by a player who's spent more time in the game

730
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:36,411
is more powerful, is only going to trigger easy combat.

731
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:39,114
And this differentiation of easy and hard

732
00:57:39,114 --> 00:57:41,596
and the way it changes as you play the game,

733
00:57:41,596 --> 00:57:44,499
I think is a real powerful tool in our game.

734
00:57:44,939 --> 00:57:50,923
tool chest for Ghost of Tsushima. And it really helps, I think, immerse the player into the world

735
00:57:50,923 --> 00:57:56,266
when the music really changes along with the action on screen. I think it really helps sell

736
00:57:56,266 --> 00:58:00,789
that that feeling of immersion for the player. And we're really proud of the system we've put

737
00:58:00,789 --> 00:58:08,914
together here for Ghost of Tsushima. And that is it in a nutshell. So I will hand it off to Pete

738
00:58:08,914 --> 00:58:10,736
to close us out here. Thanks.

739
00:58:13,153 --> 00:58:17,996
Thanks, Andrew. And thanks, Bill. And thanks, everyone. It's

740
00:58:17,996 --> 00:58:21,719
been great to be here and to talk about the music for the

741
00:58:21,719 --> 00:58:26,181
Ghost of Tsushima. This is a project that was, we really

742
00:58:26,181 --> 00:58:28,403
enjoyed. It was huge for us and

743
00:58:29,809 --> 00:58:31,990
It was really, really rewarding.

744
00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:36,952
I also want to mention before we leave that,

745
00:58:36,952 --> 00:58:39,953
while it's been a privilege for the three of us to be here

746
00:58:39,953 --> 00:58:41,733
and to talk about this score,

747
00:58:41,733 --> 00:58:44,034
that there were many, many other folks

748
00:58:44,034 --> 00:58:46,975
within our department at Sony PlayStation

749
00:58:46,975 --> 00:58:48,496
and outside of our department

750
00:58:48,496 --> 00:58:51,076
that contributed to this score.

751
00:58:51,076 --> 00:58:55,018
Like to thank my co-producer, Keith Leary,

752
00:58:55,018 --> 00:58:58,539
all the musicians, engineers, the orchestrators.

753
00:58:59,006 --> 00:59:03,088
particularly Chad Cannon, who contributed to the score,

754
00:59:03,088 --> 00:59:05,729
just some absolutely beautiful playing

755
00:59:05,729 --> 00:59:07,830
and some excellent work.

756
00:59:07,830 --> 00:59:09,591
Thanks of course to Sucker Punch.

757
00:59:09,591 --> 00:59:12,632
They were a brilliant partner in this

758
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:15,514
and we really appreciate the opportunity

759
00:59:15,514 --> 00:59:17,915
to work together and collaborate on this.

760
00:59:17,915 --> 00:59:23,618
And of course, last and certainly not least to Alon

761
00:59:23,618 --> 00:59:25,298
and to Ume for having.

762
00:59:25,668 --> 00:59:33,015
written some absolutely beautiful music, really inspiring and helped us to do our job at this

763
00:59:33,015 --> 00:59:39,100
level. So we're really grateful for that and we really appreciate how truly special this project

764
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:44,804
was and the music for it was. So thanks everyone and appreciate you watching our presentation.

765
00:59:44,804 --> 00:59:45,185
Thank you.
