00:00:05,358 --> 00:00:07,139
Hi, I'm Dori Arazi.

2
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:09,761
I'm the Director of Photography at Santa Monica Studio.

3
00:00:09,761 --> 00:00:12,623
Before we start, I kind of want to get to know you guys a

4
00:00:12,623 --> 00:00:15,125
little bit really, really quick.

5
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:18,468
Pardon me for putting my hands up.

6
00:00:18,468 --> 00:00:20,269
It's kind of bright up here.

7
00:00:20,269 --> 00:00:25,513
Any art or environment art people in the crowd today?

8
00:00:25,513 --> 00:00:26,534
Awesome.

9
00:00:26,534 --> 00:00:27,154
Level designers?

10
00:00:27,154 --> 00:00:28,735
Sweet.

11
00:00:28,735 --> 00:00:29,176
Animators?

12
00:00:29,176 --> 00:00:30,717
Represent.

13
00:00:30,717 --> 00:00:33,499
Dedicated cinematic teams or working cinematic teams?

14
00:00:36,122 --> 00:00:37,183
Cool.

15
00:00:37,183 --> 00:00:37,844
Lighters?

16
00:00:37,844 --> 00:00:41,066
Programmers?

17
00:00:41,066 --> 00:00:42,566
Nice.

18
00:00:42,566 --> 00:00:47,069
Any producers?

19
00:00:47,069 --> 00:00:48,190
Awesome.

20
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:48,670
Cool.

21
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:51,652
Any people with like a background in photography?

22
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:52,052
Awesome.

23
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,474
Well, thanks for coming.

24
00:00:54,474 --> 00:00:56,335
Concept art.

25
00:00:56,335 --> 00:00:56,915
Concept art.

26
00:00:56,915 --> 00:00:58,756
How could I forget?

27
00:00:58,756 --> 00:00:59,557
My bad.

28
00:00:59,557 --> 00:01:03,679
You guys are awesome.

29
00:01:04,473 --> 00:01:09,841
Cool. So before we go on, spoiler alert, we are going to be showing some content from God of War.

30
00:01:09,841 --> 00:01:12,625
If you have not played the game yet, my apologies.

31
00:01:14,483 --> 00:01:19,549
So on God of War, we were trying to create an immersive, interactive narrative experience

32
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:25,255
that was meaningfully engaging in a uniform manner from beginning to end.

33
00:01:25,255 --> 00:01:30,681
We're trying to kind of challenge the concepts of a game moment versus a cinematic moment

34
00:01:30,681 --> 00:01:34,786
and take the concept of a video game into true interactive entertainment.

35
00:01:36,124 --> 00:01:39,866
Now, saying emotionally engaging is easier said than done.

36
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:42,228
All of us, probably mostly all of us,

37
00:01:42,228 --> 00:01:44,089
especially people into games,

38
00:01:44,089 --> 00:01:45,870
are constantly bombarded by media.

39
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,892
Movies, TV, games, the little screens

40
00:01:48,892 --> 00:01:50,353
we have in our pockets.

41
00:01:50,353 --> 00:01:53,735
These contents are always trying to vie for our emotion.

42
00:01:53,735 --> 00:01:57,197
And what's happening over time, we get desensitized.

43
00:01:57,197 --> 00:01:59,998
We actually start creating barriers and defenses

44
00:01:59,998 --> 00:02:01,599
to push against that content,

45
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:03,400
so pretty much we could say sane.

46
00:02:05,263 --> 00:02:08,208
So, how do we break through these barriers?

47
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:13,077
How do we create visual content that is emotionally resonating?

48
00:02:13,077 --> 00:02:14,920
So we had a theory.

49
00:02:16,274 --> 00:02:19,795
we're gonna try to combine the idea of mentally engaging

50
00:02:19,795 --> 00:02:23,837
our players with emotionally engaging our players.

51
00:02:23,837 --> 00:02:25,057
Not just grabbing them by their mind,

52
00:02:25,057 --> 00:02:26,277
but grabbing them by their gut,

53
00:02:26,277 --> 00:02:28,078
grabbing them by their heart.

54
00:02:28,078 --> 00:02:31,359
And not separately in different beats of the game,

55
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,700
but together and hopefully all the time.

56
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,601
So as we go through this talk,

57
00:02:36,601 --> 00:02:37,941
I'd like you guys to ask yourself

58
00:02:37,941 --> 00:02:40,222
constantly three questions.

59
00:02:40,222 --> 00:02:42,403
One is, how are we experiencing

60
00:02:42,403 --> 00:02:43,523
the things we are looking at?

61
00:02:44,785 --> 00:02:47,529
How do we gauge that experience?

62
00:02:47,529 --> 00:02:51,294
And why are we feeling it the way we're feeling it?

63
00:02:51,294 --> 00:02:53,877
Once we figure out the how and the why,

64
00:02:53,877 --> 00:02:55,779
let's try to figure out what we can do about it

65
00:02:55,779 --> 00:02:59,203
in order to kind of utilize it,

66
00:02:59,203 --> 00:03:01,126
in order to push that engagement experience.

67
00:03:03,027 --> 00:03:05,370
So let's look at what we have out the gate in games.

68
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:08,313
We have a superpower, and that is mental absorption.

69
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:12,918
Most of the mechanics we have from the last amazing 20 years

70
00:03:12,918 --> 00:03:17,903
or so of game design is the ability to suck the viewer in

71
00:03:17,903 --> 00:03:18,404
to the content.

72
00:03:18,404 --> 00:03:20,606
And that is a very mental experience.

73
00:03:21,731 --> 00:03:24,834
So if we look at some of the standard mechanics

74
00:03:24,834 --> 00:03:28,198
we have in games these days is navigation exploration,

75
00:03:28,198 --> 00:03:31,061
it's a big boon to absorption, getting us sucked in.

76
00:03:31,061 --> 00:03:33,243
We have puzzles and other engaging mechanics,

77
00:03:33,243 --> 00:03:34,725
it's a big boon to absorption.

78
00:03:34,725 --> 00:03:37,748
We have combat, that's a big mental absorbing parameter.

79
00:03:37,748 --> 00:03:39,830
But we also have story.

80
00:03:40,658 --> 00:03:44,842
And story allows us to engage the viewer in a bit more of a sympathetic way.

81
00:03:44,842 --> 00:03:49,306
And before we move on, let's talk about the difference between sympathy and empathy.

82
00:03:49,306 --> 00:03:51,908
It's going to be critical for the remainder of this talk.

83
00:03:51,908 --> 00:03:57,813
Sympathy is our ability to feel something for somebody else.

84
00:03:57,813 --> 00:04:00,456
It's a feeling for them experience.

85
00:04:00,456 --> 00:04:05,800
Empathy is our ability to get engaged with somebody else's emotion, but actually feel

86
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,122
it as myself, as us, as we.

87
00:04:09,133 --> 00:04:13,037
It's a personal versus an external experience.

88
00:04:13,037 --> 00:04:19,865
The tricky thing with empathy is, at least we found, that you can't engage empathy directly.

89
00:04:19,865 --> 00:04:24,189
It's an amalgamation of different parameters coming together, and we'll get to that in

90
00:04:24,189 --> 00:04:24,930
a little bit.

91
00:04:27,358 --> 00:04:33,279
So we are trying to take absorption and combine it with sympathy to create a sense of empathetic

92
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:39,661
immersion, a sense you are truly, really there in the content, experiencing it as yourself,

93
00:04:39,661 --> 00:04:43,662
both from a mental standpoint and from a sympathetic emotional standpoint.

94
00:04:43,662 --> 00:04:48,763
So how do we do this?

95
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:52,574
How do we take absorption and combine it with sympathy?

96
00:04:52,574 --> 00:04:56,720
And not only that, how do we do that in a uniform enough manner

97
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,084
that we can stay consistent within this entwinement

98
00:05:00,084 --> 00:05:04,671
and maintain critical mass to have that sense of empathetic immersion

99
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:06,333
throughout the entire experience?

100
00:05:07,582 --> 00:05:11,245
So let's go back to some traditional approaches to how to tell visual stories and how to tell

101
00:05:11,245 --> 00:05:15,069
emotionally engaging moments. We'll look at the first person camera, the third person

102
00:05:15,069 --> 00:05:22,656
camera, more traditional styles. If any of you guys have motion sickness, beware.

103
00:05:41,548 --> 00:05:43,769
Cool. So let's ask ourselves, how do we feel about this?

104
00:05:43,769 --> 00:05:46,550
I definitely felt that was me, right?

105
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,451
I was the protagonist.

106
00:05:48,451 --> 00:05:50,272
That was really immersive.

107
00:05:50,272 --> 00:05:52,112
I was very absorbed.

108
00:05:52,112 --> 00:05:54,893
But I didn't really feel much for the protagonist.

109
00:05:54,893 --> 00:05:56,614
There was no emotional connection for me.

110
00:05:56,614 --> 00:05:58,435
There was no sympathy.

111
00:05:58,435 --> 00:06:00,376
And if you guys noticed, the protagonist was

112
00:06:00,376 --> 00:06:03,817
pushing their hand forward towards their female counterpart

113
00:06:03,817 --> 00:06:06,398
trying to say something, but they didn't speak.

114
00:06:06,398 --> 00:06:07,679
And we'll get to why in a moment,

115
00:06:07,679 --> 00:06:09,199
but that's actually a critical distinction

116
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,000
that's a very big problem with a first-person camera.

117
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:35,036
Let's take a look at a third-person camera and see how that makes us feel.

118
00:06:46,378 --> 00:06:52,303
Cool. So I definitely felt for them, right? There were characters in front of me, I felt for their experience,

119
00:06:52,303 --> 00:06:57,527
sympathy was definitely evoked in me, but I wasn't there. I was kind of like a fly on the wall,

120
00:06:57,527 --> 00:07:05,033
experiencing this whole thing through my mind's eye. So while I did have sympathy, I got a really

121
00:07:05,033 --> 00:07:08,276
big dip and deficit in my absorption. So there's a problem here, right?

122
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:14,223
The first-person camera has the problem where we engage so deeply in that point of view

123
00:07:14,223 --> 00:07:18,707
that we can't have the protagonist speak or it feels like the words are being inserted

124
00:07:18,707 --> 00:07:19,408
into our brain.

125
00:07:19,408 --> 00:07:23,011
And the first thing we do is we pop out of the experience.

126
00:07:23,011 --> 00:07:25,794
We get a sense of mental and emotional dissonance.

127
00:07:25,794 --> 00:07:29,056
So we can't really tell a deep emotional story in first-person camera.

128
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:32,138
Third person, while it's really empathetic, sorry,

129
00:07:32,138 --> 00:07:34,660
sympathetic, it's not absorbing enough.

130
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,901
So we can't actually get to sympathy

131
00:07:36,901 --> 00:07:38,382
with a traditional third person camera.

132
00:07:38,382 --> 00:07:42,425
So how do we push absorption onto the third person camera

133
00:07:42,425 --> 00:07:44,106
to create a sense of empathy?

134
00:07:44,106 --> 00:07:47,889
So our theory was this.

135
00:07:48,977 --> 00:07:51,520
Instead of thinking of it as a first-person camera and a third-person camera,

136
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,062
we're going to try to design from an emotional standpoint

137
00:07:54,062 --> 00:07:56,805
something like a first-and-a-half-person camera.

138
00:07:56,805 --> 00:08:02,010
We're going to try to use the third person, but bring the experience from them to me.

139
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:07,556
In a sense, combining absorption and sympathy to create a sense of empathetic immersion,

140
00:08:07,556 --> 00:08:13,222
a sense that you are truly there, engaging as yourself or as part of the team.

141
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:19,576
As we were experimenting with this state of empathetic immersion,

142
00:08:19,576 --> 00:08:23,381
we're starting to kind of sputter with successes and get a general idea of

143
00:08:23,381 --> 00:08:26,787
maybe where this can go. We realized how

144
00:08:26,787 --> 00:08:28,269
fragile the state is.

145
00:08:29,347 --> 00:08:32,048
It's kind of like running around with an egg on a spoon.

146
00:08:32,048 --> 00:08:35,310
It's really easy to get a really small bump on your spoon

147
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:36,391
and drop that egg.

148
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:37,852
The moment that egg is dropped,

149
00:08:37,852 --> 00:08:39,433
it's very hard to reconstruct it,

150
00:08:39,433 --> 00:08:40,514
put it back on the spoon

151
00:08:40,514 --> 00:08:43,436
and re-engage within that same experience.

152
00:08:43,436 --> 00:08:45,997
But just because we come in with this superpower

153
00:08:45,997 --> 00:08:48,079
out of the gate with our sense of deep absorption,

154
00:08:48,079 --> 00:08:50,040
with interactive media,

155
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,401
we have the potential to be probably

156
00:08:51,401 --> 00:08:55,043
one of the most powerful mediums for engaging storytelling.

157
00:08:55,043 --> 00:08:58,205
So how does all this relate to God of War?

158
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:02,063
God of War starts with a big problem.

159
00:09:02,063 --> 00:09:03,284
It's steeped in fantasy.

160
00:09:03,284 --> 00:09:06,687
In essence, it says, I am unreality.

161
00:09:06,687 --> 00:09:14,133
We have dragons, we have orcs, we have ogres, we have people that can lift mountains.

162
00:09:14,133 --> 00:09:15,274
That's nothing we can relate to.

163
00:09:16,538 --> 00:09:21,781
And as we were studying that sense of absorption, that sense of being sucked into the content,

164
00:09:21,781 --> 00:09:26,904
we realized that our ability to relate to our environment as something that we recognize

165
00:09:26,904 --> 00:09:31,446
is critical for us to actually be absorbed in the content.

166
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:33,006
So what we can do?

167
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:34,147
It's got a bit of a problem.

168
00:09:34,147 --> 00:09:40,530
We tried to find another visual language that has the exact opposite problem that we do.

169
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:43,952
In this case, it wasn't actually a problem, it was a blessing.

170
00:09:43,952 --> 00:09:45,773
We found the documentary style, actually.

171
00:09:46,539 --> 00:09:50,109
kind of calculate the documentary style for ourselves.

172
00:09:50,109 --> 00:09:52,055
The documentary style has.

173
00:09:52,945 --> 00:09:56,969
the visual approach of telling us that it is speaking the truth.

174
00:09:56,969 --> 00:10:00,952
We are used to seeing it tell things that are true,

175
00:10:00,952 --> 00:10:04,035
that are real, that are relatable.

176
00:10:04,035 --> 00:10:06,016
So in essence, we get a double boon.

177
00:10:06,016 --> 00:10:08,118
We get a grounded experience,

178
00:10:08,118 --> 00:10:10,640
which we're used to seeing from documentary footage,

179
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,384
but we also get a very character-relevant story

180
00:10:15,384 --> 00:10:17,066
that is character-based,

181
00:10:17,066 --> 00:10:20,088
which we're used to seeing documentary stylists use.

182
00:10:20,909 --> 00:10:24,051
So what we're trying to create is a sense of believable fantasy.

183
00:10:24,051 --> 00:10:29,714
A sense that, yes, what I'm watching around me might not be as relatable,

184
00:10:29,714 --> 00:10:30,414
but I believe it.

185
00:10:30,414 --> 00:10:32,035
So all of us here, I will take a wager that all of us here,

186
00:10:32,035 --> 00:10:36,637
can hear with our eyes many different types of film language.

187
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:42,581
It's like growing up in a family that speaks a different language.

188
00:10:42,581 --> 00:10:46,703
You might not be able to speak the language, but when you hear it...

189
00:10:47,174 --> 00:10:48,835
you completely understand it.

190
00:10:48,835 --> 00:10:50,997
So we're leveraging that fact.

191
00:10:50,997 --> 00:10:54,039
What we're telling the viewer from a visual standpoint is,

192
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:55,880
hey, this is real.

193
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,582
We're calibrating their mindset to accept reality.

194
00:10:59,582 --> 00:11:01,203
And once their shields are down,

195
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:03,465
those shields we discussed,

196
00:11:03,465 --> 00:11:04,686
then we hit them with a fantasy.

197
00:11:04,686 --> 00:11:08,548
And they take the fantasy in reference to reality.

198
00:11:08,548 --> 00:11:13,171
One of my favorite case studies for this

199
00:11:13,171 --> 00:11:14,372
was The Exorcist from 1973.

200
00:11:15,768 --> 00:11:18,390
This movie didn't really use a documentary style,

201
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:20,051
used more of a family drama style.

202
00:11:20,051 --> 00:11:23,714
We'll get back to the documentary shortly after this.

203
00:11:23,714 --> 00:11:27,317
But this movie was so terrifying at the time,

204
00:11:27,317 --> 00:11:31,180
even though it didn't use the amount of gore and shock

205
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,702
other movies did, just because it utilized

206
00:11:33,702 --> 00:11:35,123
these kind of techniques.

207
00:11:35,123 --> 00:11:36,544
So let's take a look at what they did.

208
00:11:36,544 --> 00:11:37,205
Oh, mom, can't we get a horse?

209
00:11:37,205 --> 00:11:42,048
No, we're in Washington.

210
00:11:43,967 --> 00:11:46,829
We'll see when we get home, okay?

211
00:11:46,829 --> 00:11:48,030
When can I have one?

212
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,752
We'll see, Regan. We'll see.

213
00:11:49,752 --> 00:11:51,514
Hey, listen, I'm starting the rotations.

214
00:11:51,514 --> 00:11:53,335
I want to get a personal one.

215
00:11:53,335 --> 00:11:54,096
Oh, Regan, don't!

216
00:11:57,449 --> 00:12:01,910
So really natural acting, very natural lighting.

217
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:06,552
We feel like this could be a part of our home videos, right?

218
00:12:06,552 --> 00:12:10,393
We are calibrating the viewers to relate

219
00:12:10,393 --> 00:12:12,754
to this as realistic content.

220
00:12:12,754 --> 00:12:13,634
It is very relatable.

221
00:12:13,634 --> 00:12:15,955
And the moment that brain is calibrated

222
00:12:15,955 --> 00:12:18,936
to relatable realism, this happens.

223
00:12:18,936 --> 00:12:21,117
The Holy Spirit.

224
00:12:21,682 --> 00:12:25,543
By this sign of the Holy Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ,

225
00:12:25,543 --> 00:12:32,164
who lives and reigns with the Father and the Holy Spirit.

226
00:12:32,164 --> 00:12:34,305
Deviant!

227
00:12:34,305 --> 00:12:35,305
Amen.

228
00:12:35,305 --> 00:12:37,126
Path, Defender of the Christ.

229
00:12:37,126 --> 00:12:43,407
We hit the viewer with horror.

230
00:12:43,407 --> 00:12:48,609
So what we're doing is, we're taking horror in the context of family drama.

231
00:12:49,377 --> 00:12:51,718
We're breaking down the defenses against horror first,

232
00:12:51,718 --> 00:12:53,779
and then horrifying the audience.

233
00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:54,319
This is brilliant.

234
00:12:54,319 --> 00:13:00,963
So we're essentially taking the documentary form.

235
00:13:01,485 --> 00:13:07,670
in God of War again, to bring in those absorption mechanics from that very raw documentary style

236
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:13,214
on top of that third-person camera to bring the relationship to the content from them

237
00:13:13,214 --> 00:13:21,221
to me. That way, instead of sympathizing with the character, we're empathizing as the character.

238
00:13:21,221 --> 00:13:26,845
So what was it in the documentary style we chose to latch onto from a visual standpoint?

239
00:13:29,005 --> 00:13:32,688
Our camera never does anything that a human operator can't do.

240
00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:35,069
And that was huge.

241
00:13:35,069 --> 00:13:36,770
That was a huge boon to absorption.

242
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:42,514
Because we never hit the spoon with something that we are not used to seeing in real life.

243
00:13:42,514 --> 00:13:47,858
We also shot handheld style, which is something that we're used to seeing with our smartphones

244
00:13:47,858 --> 00:13:49,018
and our home videos.

245
00:13:49,018 --> 00:13:50,839
These are things that are realistic.

246
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:52,961
This is stuff that we're used to seeing every day.

247
00:13:53,491 --> 00:13:57,492
Our shot design from a lighting and environment design standpoint was very naturalistic.

248
00:13:57,492 --> 00:14:02,793
We didn't go the whole soundstage Hollywood style where all the lights are painted and

249
00:14:02,793 --> 00:14:04,774
everything looks fully beautiful and controlled.

250
00:14:04,774 --> 00:14:10,095
The world looks as it would look if it was lit naturally and designed naturally.

251
00:14:10,095 --> 00:14:16,916
The acting was moved away from the big Shakespearean drama kind of style and moved more towards

252
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:19,737
a relatable character story from the way it was acted.

253
00:14:19,737 --> 00:14:22,818
All of those were great boons to absorption.

254
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,696
but we also did something on a sympathy side.

255
00:14:25,696 --> 00:14:29,881
We staged all the action with a focus

256
00:14:29,881 --> 00:14:31,863
on a subjective character experience.

257
00:14:31,863 --> 00:14:33,765
And what does that mean?

258
00:14:33,765 --> 00:14:38,389
Every scene, and this is mostly for the cinematic content,

259
00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:39,571
the controlled content.

260
00:14:40,495 --> 00:14:44,679
was owned and emotionally driven by a specific character

261
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:46,741
that we knew and designed ahead of time.

262
00:14:46,741 --> 00:14:50,504
Every moment within the scene gave the viewer

263
00:14:50,504 --> 00:14:52,866
somebody to sympathize with.

264
00:14:52,866 --> 00:14:54,927
And again, that comes back from traditional cinematography

265
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:58,490
and how to stain shots so they can stay sympathetic.

266
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:01,473
We never let you go from a sympathetic standpoint.

267
00:15:01,473 --> 00:15:03,415
You always had something to emotionally

268
00:15:03,415 --> 00:15:05,076
or somebody to emotionally relate to.

269
00:15:08,267 --> 00:15:15,658
Another detail we used on the camera side was to constantly keep the camera motivated to move.

270
00:15:15,658 --> 00:15:16,899
And what does that mean?

271
00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:23,689
As a camera operator, I can move the camera because me, as the camera operator, is interested to see something.

272
00:15:24,383 --> 00:15:28,466
What that does is it brings sympathy from the viewer

273
00:15:28,466 --> 00:15:31,129
to the camera operation, and it takes it away

274
00:15:31,129 --> 00:15:32,730
from the people in front of the lens,

275
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:35,553
in front of the screen, which are your heroes.

276
00:15:35,553 --> 00:15:39,396
So we did our best to never use unmotivated camera work.

277
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:42,038
Constantly motivate the camera by using motion,

278
00:15:42,038 --> 00:15:44,220
tracking of motion in front of the scene,

279
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,363
following gazes and other little psychological nuances

280
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,805
that help the camera need or want to move into a direction.

281
00:15:51,472 --> 00:15:54,533
Let's take a look at how a non-motivated camera looks.

282
00:15:54,533 --> 00:15:56,475
And again, if you guys have nausea,

283
00:15:56,475 --> 00:15:58,176
any of you, probably take a few seconds of this

284
00:15:58,176 --> 00:15:59,116
and look away.

285
00:15:59,116 --> 00:16:00,317
This is pretty intense.

286
00:16:00,317 --> 00:16:01,477
This is from Cloverfield in 2008.

287
00:16:01,477 --> 00:16:01,818
Oh, my god.

288
00:16:01,818 --> 00:16:02,378
Wait up.

289
00:16:33,417 --> 00:16:41,305
So even though this was technically a third person experience, the camera was so much

290
00:16:41,305 --> 00:16:45,368
had a mind of its own that it was almost a first person experience.

291
00:16:45,368 --> 00:16:49,813
In essence, that camera stole sympathy away from the heroes in front of the lens.

292
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,852
Let's take a look at what we did on God of War.

293
00:16:52,852 --> 00:16:54,754
This is from our E3 2016 trailer.

294
00:16:54,754 --> 00:16:59,118
And this is a action sequence, a combat sequence,

295
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,360
that are actually harder to design to stay motivated.

296
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,601
Let's see how these feel.

297
00:17:02,601 --> 00:17:02,721
Ah!

298
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:02,821
Ah!

299
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:02,961
Ah!

300
00:17:02,961 --> 00:17:03,001
Ah!

301
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:03,041
Ah!

302
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:03,101
Ah!

303
00:17:03,101 --> 00:17:03,241
Ah!

304
00:17:03,241 --> 00:17:03,482
Oh boy!

305
00:17:03,482 --> 00:17:03,582
Ah!

306
00:17:03,582 --> 00:17:03,642
Ah!

307
00:17:03,642 --> 00:17:04,162
Wait!

308
00:17:04,162 --> 00:17:10,168
Wait!

309
00:17:10,168 --> 00:17:14,552
Do it!

310
00:17:14,552 --> 00:17:14,792
Ah!

311
00:17:21,085 --> 00:17:36,017
Off the ice, now!

312
00:17:36,017 --> 00:17:40,661
So the camera was moving around, zooming around, doing some crazy stuff,

313
00:17:40,661 --> 00:17:42,503
but never in an unmotivated manner.

314
00:17:42,923 --> 00:17:45,626
So if we did our job well, and I believe we did,

315
00:17:45,626 --> 00:17:49,550
you would never notice that there's a camera operator

316
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,130
on set there.

317
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:53,453
You will just be focused on the action, which brings us back

318
00:17:53,453 --> 00:17:55,575
to the idea of staging and blocking a scene.

319
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,917
If you do want to block a scene in a way

320
00:17:57,917 --> 00:18:00,039
that the camera stays invisible, you

321
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:01,921
can't just shoot it or film it.

322
00:18:01,921 --> 00:18:06,165
You have to think about how the action motivates your camera

323
00:18:06,165 --> 00:18:08,146
movements and plan for that ahead of time.

324
00:18:10,709 --> 00:18:14,891
So let's move a little bit more towards the absorbing side of gameplay,

325
00:18:14,891 --> 00:18:19,252
the part where your player actually has their hands on the stick

326
00:18:19,252 --> 00:18:22,073
and they're in control of the camera, the interactive side.

327
00:18:22,073 --> 00:18:23,374
So here we have opposite problem.

328
00:18:23,374 --> 00:18:27,996
We have a problem where this is a very absorbing time of the game experience,

329
00:18:27,996 --> 00:18:30,057
but can be very lacking in sympathy.

330
00:18:30,737 --> 00:18:34,218
So how do we elevate that sense of sympathy on the interactive sides?

331
00:18:34,218 --> 00:18:38,479
What we try to do is pretty much put ourselves in the mindset of

332
00:18:38,479 --> 00:18:44,242
shooting a scene and thinking as image makers and as visual storytellers,

333
00:18:44,242 --> 00:18:47,603
what are the processes we are doing in order to make a certain moment

334
00:18:47,603 --> 00:18:50,204
feel a certain way? Quantify them

335
00:18:50,204 --> 00:18:54,105
and then proceduralize them on the interactive camera.

336
00:18:54,871 --> 00:18:58,572
So in essence, instead of having a narrative-driven camera,

337
00:18:58,572 --> 00:19:00,773
we're having a camera-driven narrative.

338
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:03,614
So it's all about asking yourself questions

339
00:19:03,614 --> 00:19:06,735
of what is it in the world that I can use to latch onto

340
00:19:06,735 --> 00:19:08,736
in order to drive what in my camera?

341
00:19:08,736 --> 00:19:11,897
Is the weather gonna make my camera shake more?

342
00:19:11,897 --> 00:19:13,038
If I look at that deer,

343
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:15,059
are they gonna look back and run away?

344
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:16,299
What is it that I can do to drive it?

345
00:19:16,299 --> 00:19:19,960
And what we found is there are so many things you can do

346
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,862
that as you start piling them onto the camera,

347
00:19:23,316 --> 00:19:25,317
it starts distracting from the game experience,

348
00:19:25,317 --> 00:19:26,578
it starts introducing chaos.

349
00:19:26,578 --> 00:19:30,501
So the trick was, how do we bring sympathy

350
00:19:30,501 --> 00:19:33,383
into this interactive moment in the game,

351
00:19:33,383 --> 00:19:35,904
but still maintain order and not introduce chaos?

352
00:19:35,904 --> 00:19:41,268
So on the bottom here, you can see a pretty traditional

353
00:19:41,268 --> 00:19:43,609
narrative style game and how it flows.

354
00:19:43,609 --> 00:19:45,050
Starts with the opening cinematic.

355
00:19:45,925 --> 00:19:50,032
goes into some gameplay, goes back into a cinematic either at the end of the level or

356
00:19:50,032 --> 00:19:54,640
when you achieved some form of achievement, back into gameplay over and over until you

357
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,723
are likely going to get a big cinematic for ending the game.

358
00:19:58,365 --> 00:20:02,666
What we try to do is take the sympathetic parts of the game,

359
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:05,367
which are the cinematics, and make them more absorbing.

360
00:20:05,367 --> 00:20:08,728
And then take the absorbing parts of the video game

361
00:20:08,728 --> 00:20:12,329
and make them more cinematic, more sympathetic.

362
00:20:12,329 --> 00:20:15,830
And then we did something completely crazy.

363
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:16,890
We never cut the camera.

364
00:20:19,898 --> 00:20:24,862
Not cutting the camera was what allowed us to maintain a seamless transition from an

365
00:20:24,862 --> 00:20:30,326
emotional standpoint, from our sympathetic moments to our absorbing moments, and maintain

366
00:20:30,326 --> 00:20:36,151
that critical mass in order to fully achieve that sense of empathetic immersion throughout

367
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:40,895
the entire game experience.

368
00:20:40,895 --> 00:20:41,896
Cuts are very jarring.

369
00:20:41,896 --> 00:20:43,998
They're like a mental pop.

370
00:20:44,985 --> 00:20:47,727
And while we do blink in our day-to-day lives,

371
00:20:47,727 --> 00:20:49,729
blinking doesn't teleport us.

372
00:20:49,729 --> 00:20:51,751
So we can't relate to cutting.

373
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:52,812
The moment we start cutting,

374
00:20:52,812 --> 00:20:55,335
we start experiencing things more from our mind's eye,

375
00:20:55,335 --> 00:20:57,337
more from a distance

376
00:20:57,337 --> 00:21:00,080
than from the actual personal experience.

377
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,423
So in essence, we are losing absorption.

378
00:21:03,423 --> 00:21:04,524
And if we lose absorption,

379
00:21:04,524 --> 00:21:07,567
we can't combine that with sympathy, and we lose the eye.

380
00:21:10,709 --> 00:21:12,070
So hey, let's not cut, right?

381
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:12,370
No big deal.

382
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:16,653
That's pretty tough.

383
00:21:16,653 --> 00:21:20,536
As visual storytellers, we are used to having

384
00:21:20,536 --> 00:21:24,259
certain tools in our back pocket to tell our visual story.

385
00:21:24,259 --> 00:21:28,383
And as we started experimenting with not cutting,

386
00:21:28,383 --> 00:21:30,244
we found that it's like writing a novel

387
00:21:30,244 --> 00:21:32,246
without using punctuation or nouns.

388
00:21:32,246 --> 00:21:35,108
You can't create establishing shots,

389
00:21:35,108 --> 00:21:37,130
you can't cut to reactions, you can't cut to inserts.

390
00:21:37,503 --> 00:21:39,224
You can't use editing for pacing.

391
00:21:39,224 --> 00:21:40,626
You can't use editing for clarity.

392
00:21:40,626 --> 00:21:43,468
You can't cut in and out of your cinematics.

393
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:45,250
You can't cut between your prime lenses

394
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,992
to get different types of emotions from your lensing.

395
00:21:47,992 --> 00:21:50,975
So how do we keep the content not only dynamic,

396
00:21:50,975 --> 00:21:52,056
but emotionally engaging?

397
00:21:52,056 --> 00:21:53,477
The reason I bolded cut to reaction,

398
00:21:53,477 --> 00:21:54,038
the concept of the A-B cut.

399
00:22:01,142 --> 00:22:04,943
cutting from one person to another, is the bread and butter

400
00:22:04,943 --> 00:22:08,744
of sympathetic storytelling from a visual standpoint.

401
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:12,386
Without that mechanic, again, we're left only with absorption.

402
00:22:12,386 --> 00:22:15,307
And with absorption alone, we can't have empathetic immersion.

403
00:22:15,307 --> 00:22:20,208
So, why is this mechanic so important

404
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:23,670
from an emotional standpoint in order to maintain sympathy?

405
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:26,871
If you look at that little graph on the bottom left there...

406
00:22:27,821 --> 00:22:30,304
and see that line of action between these two people talking,

407
00:22:30,304 --> 00:22:34,848
and for a moment think of this line of action as a line of sympathy.

408
00:22:34,848 --> 00:22:37,151
If I'm 90 degrees to the line of sympathy,

409
00:22:37,151 --> 00:22:40,274
my shot would be very detached and very objective.

410
00:22:40,274 --> 00:22:44,559
It will tell me no emotional story, it will just deliver the content you are looking at.

411
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,200
This is now happening.

412
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,762
I don't want to tell you how you feel about it.

413
00:22:48,655 --> 00:22:54,339
That's a very flat, emotionally relevant delivery.

414
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:56,761
It's not going to give us that sense of sympathy

415
00:22:56,761 --> 00:22:59,183
we need for empathetic immersion.

416
00:22:59,183 --> 00:23:02,986
As I start dialing that camera towards the line of sympathy,

417
00:23:02,986 --> 00:23:05,488
I start raising my sympathy towards the characters.

418
00:23:05,488 --> 00:23:09,210
So the easiest thing to do is just dial two cameras

419
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:10,931
to that highest point of sympathy

420
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:13,053
and cut between them over a dialogue,

421
00:23:13,053 --> 00:23:14,174
which would be the cleanest way

422
00:23:14,174 --> 00:23:17,116
to create a sympathetic delivery.

423
00:23:17,116 --> 00:23:17,816
But we don't cut.

424
00:23:19,718 --> 00:23:21,438
So let's look at this example.

425
00:23:21,438 --> 00:23:23,999
This is a run of the mail script we had to break down.

426
00:23:23,999 --> 00:23:26,600
It's just an opening of one of the sequences in God of War.

427
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,122
In this moment, Kratos' son was ill.

428
00:23:30,122 --> 00:23:33,583
He had to leave his son with Freya, the witch in the woods,

429
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:35,724
and go get the thing that heals him.

430
00:23:35,724 --> 00:23:36,764
He brings it back.

431
00:23:36,764 --> 00:23:39,145
Freya thanks him for it, does something with it.

432
00:23:39,145 --> 00:23:41,126
He goes to his kid to check his temperature.

433
00:23:41,126 --> 00:23:41,806
Freya talks to him.

434
00:23:41,806 --> 00:23:42,706
He talks to Freya.

435
00:23:42,706 --> 00:23:45,727
There's a whole bunch of back and forth AB dialogue

436
00:23:45,727 --> 00:23:47,388
with three characters, one of them being mute.

437
00:23:48,298 --> 00:23:51,341
So let's take a look at how that ended up being solved.

438
00:23:51,341 --> 00:23:52,001
You have it.

439
00:23:52,001 --> 00:24:06,095
Back of your hand.

440
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:20,001
I can break the fever, but to heal...

441
00:24:20,001 --> 00:24:21,943
He must know the truth of what he is.

442
00:24:21,943 --> 00:24:28,906
So hopefully you guys felt that that was completely seamless and looked very effortless.

443
00:24:28,906 --> 00:24:34,870
If not, then I'm not going to be happy right now.

444
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:37,691
Let's take a look at what we actually had to do to make this work.

445
00:24:37,691 --> 00:24:38,331
You have it.

446
00:24:38,331 --> 00:24:40,633
So we push in to a two-opening shot.

447
00:24:41,569 --> 00:24:49,472
We use Freya's screen left motion to motivate the camera to move to give her her moment to establish her having business with this item.

448
00:24:49,472 --> 00:24:55,975
Then we use her screen right motion to reveal a three shot providing empathy between Kratos and his son.

449
00:24:55,975 --> 00:24:59,076
Now we're both facing camera, we can have a dialogue.

450
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:09,369
We give her motivation to leave her spot,

451
00:25:09,369 --> 00:25:11,351
using her screen left motion with a zoom

452
00:25:11,351 --> 00:25:12,692
to give her her line,

453
00:25:12,692 --> 00:25:15,314
having her screen right reveal Kratos

454
00:25:15,314 --> 00:25:17,415
to give his bee delivery.

455
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:18,476
And we had over three and a half hours

456
00:25:18,476 --> 00:25:20,338
of this kind of content.

457
00:25:20,338 --> 00:25:21,279
So, good times.

458
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:21,599
Ha ha.

459
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:21,959
Thank you.

460
00:25:21,959 --> 00:25:22,379
Thank you.

461
00:25:22,379 --> 00:25:22,580
Thank you.

462
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,982
Thank you.

463
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:25,242
Thank you.

464
00:25:25,242 --> 00:25:25,682
Thank you.

465
00:25:25,682 --> 00:25:25,902
Thank you.

466
00:25:25,902 --> 00:25:26,162
Thank you.

467
00:25:26,162 --> 00:25:27,103
Thank you.

468
00:25:27,103 --> 00:25:27,664
Thank you.

469
00:25:27,664 --> 00:25:33,548
Thank you.

470
00:25:34,874 --> 00:25:40,056
Another challenge we had to encounter with this no-cut camera is something that is really

471
00:25:40,056 --> 00:25:43,757
quintessential to the God of War franchise, and that giant sense of scale.

472
00:25:43,757 --> 00:25:50,399
Critters has always fought these giant mountain-sized creatures and monsters, and the easiest way

473
00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:55,280
to make a hero feel small is to get them very far away from the camera, make them very little,

474
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,681
next to something very, very large.

475
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:00,422
How do we get our hero away from the camera?

476
00:26:01,124 --> 00:26:04,785
And if we actually manage to do that, how do we bring him back to the camera without

477
00:26:04,785 --> 00:26:08,826
making it look like we're chasing after him and completely give the sympathy back to the

478
00:26:08,826 --> 00:26:14,368
camera operator? So this is a talk in itself. If you guys want to check out how we did it,

479
00:26:14,368 --> 00:26:21,030
pick up the game. I'm sure you guys can find those spots and see how we did it. On a technical

480
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:27,172
standpoint, we had to blend between our interactive moments and our non-interactive

481
00:26:27,172 --> 00:26:29,472
moments back into our interactive moments.

482
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:33,692
having needing to do that right was critical

483
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:36,615
to get that seamless experience to happen

484
00:26:36,615 --> 00:26:38,836
because if those transitions were jarring,

485
00:26:38,836 --> 00:26:42,600
we would knock the spoon and we'd lose the egg.

486
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,801
So we had to blend navigation,

487
00:26:44,801 --> 00:26:48,104
we had to blend animation, camera animation,

488
00:26:48,104 --> 00:26:51,747
in and out of combat, and that was quintessential

489
00:26:51,747 --> 00:26:53,508
to keeping that egg on a spoon.

490
00:26:53,508 --> 00:26:55,210
That was a nightmare in itself.

491
00:26:56,852 --> 00:26:58,712
So how do we tackle this beast?

492
00:26:58,712 --> 00:27:00,793
We use a lot of different techniques.

493
00:27:00,793 --> 00:27:04,014
I'm gonna be focusing on a few today.

494
00:27:04,014 --> 00:27:07,375
How we treated zooming, how we treated visual defects,

495
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:10,236
how we treated handheld, previs,

496
00:27:10,236 --> 00:27:11,936
and then how we brought it all together on set

497
00:27:11,936 --> 00:27:12,916
working with the actors.

498
00:27:12,916 --> 00:27:15,237
So zooming.

499
00:27:15,237 --> 00:27:17,758
As we were studying some reference content,

500
00:27:17,758 --> 00:27:20,439
trying to figure out how we're gonna approach this,

501
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:23,220
we noticed that people don't really zoom anymore.

502
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,120
They cut between prime lenses.

503
00:27:26,263 --> 00:27:27,804
They cut for drama.

504
00:27:27,804 --> 00:27:33,148
We had to actually go back to the drawing board and figure out what psychologically

505
00:27:33,148 --> 00:27:36,110
happens in a viewer when they witness a zoom.

506
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:39,152
What kind of zoom promotes what kind of emotion?

507
00:27:39,152 --> 00:27:44,316
And not only that, how to blend our zooms into the content because, again, we don't

508
00:27:44,316 --> 00:27:49,179
want to draw attention to the camera operation, so the zooms have to be completely invisible.

509
00:27:49,179 --> 00:27:53,822
What we ended up doing is breaking zooms into two utilities.

510
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:59,023
Zooming for utility, meaning I have to go from one place to another, maybe a zoom will

511
00:27:59,023 --> 00:28:05,486
help me. And two, zooming for emotional impact and emotional content. So let's take an example

512
00:28:05,486 --> 00:28:11,049
for a zoom for utility here. This is going back to our 2016 demo. We already watched

513
00:28:11,049 --> 00:28:15,152
the scene. You guys probably didn't notice that we had a pretty crazy zoom here. Let's

514
00:28:15,152 --> 00:28:15,832
take a quick look.

515
00:28:15,832 --> 00:28:16,152
Oh boy.

516
00:28:24,381 --> 00:28:25,361
Oh, wait!

517
00:28:25,361 --> 00:28:28,323
I hope he didn't notice I had a big zoom in here.

518
00:28:28,323 --> 00:28:31,385
Um, what we did here,

519
00:28:31,385 --> 00:28:33,886
we used a really wide 24mm lens

520
00:28:33,886 --> 00:28:35,587
to exasperate that big impact

521
00:28:35,587 --> 00:28:38,709
when Kratos slams that troll into the ice.

522
00:28:38,709 --> 00:28:41,531
To get that drama, we need it from a wide-angle lens.

523
00:28:41,531 --> 00:28:44,532
But then we need it to be 20 feet behind action

524
00:28:44,532 --> 00:28:48,154
within probably a matter of a second and a half

525
00:28:48,154 --> 00:28:50,576
to get over the kid's shoulder when he draws the arrow.

526
00:28:51,821 --> 00:28:54,624
So what we did, we dollied the camera back

527
00:28:54,624 --> 00:28:57,787
as we were zooming in, which essentially maintained Kratos

528
00:28:57,787 --> 00:29:00,169
on screen in the same size he was,

529
00:29:00,169 --> 00:29:02,291
making you feel like there's no camera movement,

530
00:29:02,291 --> 00:29:05,374
while we're actually trucking the camera 20 feet back.

531
00:29:05,374 --> 00:29:07,877
Let's take a look at that again in slow motion.

532
00:29:07,877 --> 00:29:12,922
Look at how that environment in the background compresses

533
00:29:12,922 --> 00:29:15,284
as the camera zooms.

534
00:29:15,284 --> 00:29:16,585
We're 20 feet behind him.

535
00:29:19,456 --> 00:29:21,897
Now let's look at an emotional content zoom.

536
00:29:21,897 --> 00:29:25,738
In this scene, Kratos starts off his, you know,

537
00:29:25,738 --> 00:29:29,260
traditional, standard, mean, kind of tough dad.

538
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:32,401
Very impersonal shot, 24 millimeter wide.

539
00:29:32,401 --> 00:29:35,162
And very quickly after that, we transition to Kratos

540
00:29:35,162 --> 00:29:38,964
having one of probably the only two intimate moments

541
00:29:38,964 --> 00:29:41,725
he has within the game, and that's gathering the ashes

542
00:29:41,725 --> 00:29:43,185
of his wife that he just cremated.

543
00:29:43,911 --> 00:29:46,412
We ended up pushing all the way to 120 millimeters

544
00:29:46,412 --> 00:29:50,573
to get that sense of intimacy and compressed internal space.

545
00:29:50,573 --> 00:29:53,994
This is actually the biggest zoom range we did in the game.

546
00:29:53,994 --> 00:29:56,935
What we also noticed is in order to hide a zoom,

547
00:29:56,935 --> 00:30:00,056
but still make it emotionally impactful,

548
00:30:00,056 --> 00:30:03,137
we can kinda slap it on some motion

549
00:30:03,137 --> 00:30:04,718
that the character does,

550
00:30:04,718 --> 00:30:07,258
utilizing the motion to convey the zoom.

551
00:30:07,258 --> 00:30:08,279
And if it's designed well,

552
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:10,379
that motion also conveys what the character

553
00:30:10,379 --> 00:30:12,100
is emotionally going through.

554
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,420
In this case, it's a walk from.

555
00:30:13,824 --> 00:30:19,029
his son after he dismisses his son to walking towards his wife's cremation site.

556
00:30:19,029 --> 00:30:21,072
Let's take a look at how that looks.

557
00:30:43,213 --> 00:30:46,214
And we're at 120 millimeters.

558
00:30:46,214 --> 00:30:51,075
And then, of course, we have to find our way back, right?

559
00:30:51,075 --> 00:30:52,116
But that's a different story.

560
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:56,037
So approach to visual defects.

561
00:30:56,037 --> 00:30:59,958
We actually worked pretty hard to make our visuals look worse.

562
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:03,660
The whole thing came from the problem of the uncanny valley.

563
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,840
And for those of you who are not familiar with the uncanny valley,

564
00:31:06,569 --> 00:31:10,771
The traditional thought would say that if something looks better,

565
00:31:10,771 --> 00:31:12,432
then it looks more believable.

566
00:31:12,432 --> 00:31:15,734
Kind of like in a linear manner, the more believable, the more relatable.

567
00:31:15,734 --> 00:31:20,176
What actually happens is when something becomes very close to realistic,

568
00:31:20,176 --> 00:31:23,818
our psyche starts judging it in a very harsh manner.

569
00:31:23,818 --> 00:31:27,080
It looks for realism, and it finds all the defects.

570
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:32,103
There is a giant dip in believability just before you hit photorealism.

571
00:31:33,003 --> 00:31:36,144
And because of the power of our game engine these days

572
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,744
and our amazing tech render teams

573
00:31:37,744 --> 00:31:38,625
and our amazing art teams,

574
00:31:38,625 --> 00:31:42,206
we fell right in the middle of the uncanny valley.

575
00:31:42,206 --> 00:31:46,367
So what we try to do is go back to the documentary style

576
00:31:46,367 --> 00:31:50,728
and find things that we relate to as realistic footage

577
00:31:50,728 --> 00:31:53,409
and slap on top of the image to try to at least,

578
00:31:53,409 --> 00:31:57,070
if not completely skip over the uncanny valley,

579
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:59,010
kind of make it less, more shallow, less deep.

580
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:04,774
So we added film grain, we added handheld,

581
00:32:04,774 --> 00:32:07,116
we added crap hitting your lens all over the place,

582
00:32:07,116 --> 00:32:10,059
lens flare, chromatic aberration, we slipped on focus.

583
00:32:10,059 --> 00:32:14,124
All these things that if you were a filmmaker

584
00:32:14,124 --> 00:32:17,087
shooting live action, you would try at all costs to avoid.

585
00:32:18,018 --> 00:32:22,781
But what it did is again spike our brains and calibrate them

586
00:32:22,781 --> 00:32:26,844
toward a sense of realism and helped us skip over the

587
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:30,887
uncanny valley and relate to the footage without pushing

588
00:32:30,887 --> 00:32:32,788
back against it and then having a giant dip in

589
00:32:32,788 --> 00:32:33,188
absorption.

590
00:32:33,188 --> 00:32:37,071
A quick note on that, having a very strong understanding on

591
00:32:37,071 --> 00:32:42,274
how lenses, real world lenses work, how film backs work, how

592
00:32:42,274 --> 00:32:43,695
photo sensors work.

593
00:32:44,133 --> 00:32:47,115
how images actually get created in what fashion

594
00:32:47,115 --> 00:32:49,557
allowed us to do this in a very realistic manner,

595
00:32:49,557 --> 00:32:52,118
not just by slapping some elements on the lens

596
00:32:52,118 --> 00:32:54,580
and on the screen in our case,

597
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,562
and hoping to achieve a sense of realism.

598
00:32:56,562 --> 00:32:58,843
So our approach to handheld,

599
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:02,085
that was a big, big boon for us

600
00:33:02,085 --> 00:33:04,187
in terms of getting that raw absorption.

601
00:33:04,187 --> 00:33:07,069
I've heard a lot of people approach handheld

602
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:11,032
as this kind of programmatic wobble on the screen,

603
00:33:11,032 --> 00:33:12,653
and nothing can be further from the truth.

604
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:16,135
Each handheld has its own style.

605
00:33:16,135 --> 00:33:18,699
Not all handhelds are created equal.

606
00:33:18,699 --> 00:33:21,123
Sometimes blends of handhelds are needed

607
00:33:21,123 --> 00:33:23,547
in order to create a certain emotion

608
00:33:23,547 --> 00:33:24,929
and drive a certain sense.

609
00:33:27,097 --> 00:33:31,140
we actually went onto the mocap stage and shot our handhelds.

610
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:35,263
On the bottom left here, you can see me in a mocap stage,

611
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:39,466
well, the footage generated by me on a mocap stage,

612
00:33:39,466 --> 00:33:41,888
holding the camera and trying to keep it steady.

613
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:45,491
On the far right, you can see me on a treadmill,

614
00:33:45,491 --> 00:33:50,014
jogging in a mocap studio, trying to keep my camera steady.

615
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,901
to really get your handhelds to feel correct

616
00:33:55,901 --> 00:33:59,742
and really help bridge things like the uncanny valley

617
00:33:59,742 --> 00:34:02,723
or help calibrate the viewers into a documentary style.

618
00:34:02,723 --> 00:34:04,443
You have to treat them with the same amount

619
00:34:04,443 --> 00:34:05,964
of care and seriousness that you treat

620
00:34:05,964 --> 00:34:07,684
your character animations.

621
00:34:07,684 --> 00:34:13,986
What we did find is that handheld is incredibly nauseating.

622
00:34:13,986 --> 00:34:17,047
And as somebody who for the first six months

623
00:34:17,047 --> 00:34:19,127
of his work on God of War had Dramamine on his desk,

624
00:34:19,665 --> 00:34:24,607
I was very passionate about this.

625
00:34:24,607 --> 00:34:29,810
We had to figure out how to take our handheld wholesale

626
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:32,391
and wrap it in some form of UI that allows the viewer

627
00:34:32,391 --> 00:34:35,112
to either calibrate it up or down to match

628
00:34:35,112 --> 00:34:38,413
their personal user experience, while still maintaining

629
00:34:38,413 --> 00:34:40,434
that emotional need that handheld provides

630
00:34:40,434 --> 00:34:41,635
from a documentary standpoint.

631
00:34:44,425 --> 00:34:51,168
What we also found is in order to diminish the nausea and diminish the motion a little bit,

632
00:34:51,168 --> 00:34:58,870
thinking of handheld from a rotational and translational standpoint separately was incredibly critical.

633
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:05,172
The rotations controlled the movement of the world and how it bops up and down and around us,

634
00:35:05,172 --> 00:35:08,173
while the translations controlled the parallax of the foreground.

635
00:35:09,045 --> 00:35:11,885
Separating those two allowed us to massage the data,

636
00:35:11,885 --> 00:35:14,266
maintain it looking realistic,

637
00:35:14,266 --> 00:35:16,166
but lower its sense of nausea.

638
00:35:16,166 --> 00:35:20,727
So on the far left, we can see the raw jog motion

639
00:35:20,727 --> 00:35:21,627
that we shot on stage.

640
00:35:21,627 --> 00:35:25,788
On the center, you can see us blending it down a little bit

641
00:35:25,788 --> 00:35:28,509
with a combination of rotation and translation.

642
00:35:28,509 --> 00:35:31,349
And on the far right, you can see that actual data

643
00:35:31,349 --> 00:35:33,030
being applied to a jog in the game.

644
00:35:34,156 --> 00:35:36,897
What you'll also notice is that movement on the screen

645
00:35:36,897 --> 00:35:39,539
has a major factor to diminishing

646
00:35:39,539 --> 00:35:40,880
your perception of handheld.

647
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,161
So that's something you have to account for

648
00:35:43,161 --> 00:35:44,762
when you're blending in your handheld data.

649
00:35:44,762 --> 00:35:51,065
So back to this design of the no cuts.

650
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:52,826
Previs was critical.

651
00:35:52,826 --> 00:35:55,628
We previs-ed, revised it, previs-ed again.

652
00:35:55,628 --> 00:35:58,169
The idea is to make all your mistakes

653
00:35:58,169 --> 00:36:01,051
where it's fast and where it's cheap.

654
00:36:01,051 --> 00:36:02,952
Don't go on set and try to make your mistakes there.

655
00:36:04,473 --> 00:36:07,375
And also, you don't have to use super high-end methods

656
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:12,399
of previs, like hand-key previs in 3D or rough mocap.

657
00:36:12,399 --> 00:36:15,081
Find the right element and style of previs

658
00:36:15,081 --> 00:36:17,183
you need in order to deliver what

659
00:36:17,183 --> 00:36:18,984
the shot needs to look like.

660
00:36:18,984 --> 00:36:19,965
Find your designs.

661
00:36:19,965 --> 00:36:20,806
Find your blocking.

662
00:36:20,806 --> 00:36:22,207
Find your staging.

663
00:36:22,207 --> 00:36:23,588
Find it quickly, and quickly enough

664
00:36:23,588 --> 00:36:24,909
for you to be able to iterate on it

665
00:36:24,909 --> 00:36:27,451
within the production timelines.

666
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:31,374
And again, if you don't have previs, do not go on set.

667
00:36:31,374 --> 00:36:33,116
We did try that.

668
00:36:33,116 --> 00:36:33,556
It wasn't pretty.

669
00:36:35,799 --> 00:36:37,279
So let's take a look at a previous example.

670
00:36:37,279 --> 00:36:39,520
This was shot with a DSLR using a lens

671
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,680
that roughly represented the focal lengths

672
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,341
we were wanting for that specific scene.

673
00:36:44,341 --> 00:36:48,302
We shot this with our cinematic animation crew,

674
00:36:48,302 --> 00:36:52,123
Erica Pinto, Umberto Bossi, and Avieni.

675
00:36:52,123 --> 00:36:56,324
And I found that animators are great to work with,

676
00:36:56,324 --> 00:36:58,044
and they have a lot of fun doing it.

677
00:36:58,044 --> 00:36:58,724
I do as well.

678
00:36:58,724 --> 00:37:00,065
Let's take a look at how the scene looked.

679
00:37:06,826 --> 00:37:07,346
Your bow!

680
00:37:07,346 --> 00:37:07,486
Right!

681
00:37:07,486 --> 00:37:27,960
I'm glad you're okay.

682
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,841
So again, working with your teammates is awesome.

683
00:37:48,841 --> 00:37:51,142
We had a lot of fun shooting this scene.

684
00:37:51,142 --> 00:37:54,523
We slapped it together, put it into After Effects

685
00:37:54,523 --> 00:37:57,084
just to get some lighting cues, some audio cues,

686
00:37:57,084 --> 00:37:59,105
just to find the mood of the scene.

687
00:37:59,105 --> 00:38:01,326
But we found exactly what we needed to do

688
00:38:01,326 --> 00:38:02,246
to make the scene work.

689
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:04,047
We found the blocking, the staging,

690
00:38:04,047 --> 00:38:06,447
where to hide the zooms, how to stage the scene

691
00:38:06,447 --> 00:38:08,228
to properly emotionally deliver.

692
00:38:08,228 --> 00:38:10,989
So now let's see how it actually looked like in the game.

693
00:38:10,989 --> 00:38:11,269
Shoot.

694
00:38:11,269 --> 00:38:11,669
What was that?

695
00:38:11,669 --> 00:38:11,950
The ball.

696
00:38:49,264 --> 00:38:53,185
So, virtually identical, which is great.

697
00:38:53,185 --> 00:38:56,767
It means that we know what we're doing on set,

698
00:38:56,767 --> 00:38:59,447
we know how to design this ballet between the camera and the actors,

699
00:38:59,447 --> 00:39:02,148
what the actors need to be doing, what the camera needs to be doing,

700
00:39:02,148 --> 00:39:06,190
when, at what pacing, and we don't have to figure all that out on set,

701
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:09,431
which makes shooting really, really, really comfortable.

702
00:39:09,431 --> 00:39:14,413
One thing to keep in mind, though, about, well, some things to keep in mind about Previs,

703
00:39:16,501 --> 00:39:23,402
If possible, at least for me, refrain from pre-vising in a three-dimensional software.

704
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:30,784
That idea of needing to use a skill set in order to explore a shot already takes you

705
00:39:30,784 --> 00:39:33,184
one step away from cleanly exploring your concepts.

706
00:39:33,184 --> 00:39:39,146
If you can, explore all your scenes in your mind, draw them down in quick thumbnails,

707
00:39:39,146 --> 00:39:41,186
and then only go into the 3D software where

708
00:39:41,516 --> 00:39:43,696
you're trying to figure out if what you visualized

709
00:39:43,696 --> 00:39:44,337
actually works.

710
00:39:44,337 --> 00:39:47,337
I find I get much better and much more interesting results.

711
00:39:47,337 --> 00:39:52,158
Just because of the realism of game production,

712
00:39:52,158 --> 00:39:54,599
we don't always have the environments

713
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:58,180
that we're going to shoot in ready when we need to shoot.

714
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:02,901
So by all means, if you can, try avoiding that temptation

715
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:03,981
of shooting generic.

716
00:40:04,797 --> 00:40:05,658
And what does generic mean?

717
00:40:05,658 --> 00:40:08,059
Oh, we'll just shoot or design or animate

718
00:40:08,059 --> 00:40:09,921
based on our characters,

719
00:40:09,921 --> 00:40:11,162
based on where the camera's gonna go,

720
00:40:11,162 --> 00:40:12,763
then we're just gonna take that whole thing

721
00:40:12,763 --> 00:40:14,204
and just plop it into an environment,

722
00:40:14,204 --> 00:40:14,824
it's gonna look great.

723
00:40:14,824 --> 00:40:15,685
It won't.

724
00:40:15,685 --> 00:40:19,007
You have to think about how the environment

725
00:40:19,007 --> 00:40:20,588
is gonna look like in your shot.

726
00:40:20,588 --> 00:40:21,949
You have to think about what your character's

727
00:40:21,949 --> 00:40:24,171
gonna be touching, where they're gonna be sitting.

728
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:26,893
Without that level of interaction with your environment,

729
00:40:26,893 --> 00:40:28,274
your scenes are gonna be flat

730
00:40:28,274 --> 00:40:29,915
and you're gonna lose a sense of absorption

731
00:40:29,915 --> 00:40:32,937
and you will not be able to create empathetic immersion.

732
00:40:32,937 --> 00:40:32,977
So,

733
00:40:34,174 --> 00:40:36,055
Find a good cadence with your level designers

734
00:40:36,055 --> 00:40:38,116
and your concept artists and your level artists

735
00:40:38,116 --> 00:40:40,737
and see if you can find a way to roughly thumb out

736
00:40:40,737 --> 00:40:43,298
areas that will give you what you need in order

737
00:40:43,298 --> 00:40:46,359
to drive your scenes forward without pushing

738
00:40:46,359 --> 00:40:48,120
the production timeline beyond what it can go.

739
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:55,063
The bottom line is, if you really bust your butt

740
00:40:55,063 --> 00:40:58,644
and work like crazy and it looks like you've done nothing

741
00:40:58,644 --> 00:41:01,265
and things look completely natural, you're onto something.

742
00:41:04,665 --> 00:41:08,207
So how to take this whole thing and work with the actors.

743
00:41:08,207 --> 00:41:10,768
Rehearsal was key for us.

744
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:12,189
Actors already have a lot on their minds.

745
00:41:12,189 --> 00:41:14,090
They have to find the character,

746
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:15,871
they have to memorize their lines,

747
00:41:15,871 --> 00:41:18,432
especially in a one-er because in a one-er,

748
00:41:18,432 --> 00:41:21,333
they have to memorize all their lines for the scene.

749
00:41:21,333 --> 00:41:22,474
It's not per cut and not per shot.

750
00:41:22,474 --> 00:41:25,615
So if they now have to memorize the choreography

751
00:41:25,615 --> 00:41:28,617
of what they need to be doing on top of their lines

752
00:41:28,617 --> 00:41:29,597
and trying to perform,

753
00:41:29,597 --> 00:41:31,758
you're not gonna get a good performance out of them.

754
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:39,756
So incorporating that rehearsal and trying to get them to incorporate the ballet

755
00:41:39,756 --> 00:41:44,880
was very comfortable for them to then take that information on set and focus on acting.

756
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,964
As the shot designer, you have to always keep in mind

757
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:55,029
that you want to give your actors the freedom to perform and surprise you on set.

758
00:41:55,029 --> 00:42:00,693
You don't want to tie their hands so tight that you tell them exactly what to do and when,

759
00:42:00,693 --> 00:42:02,014
or you don't want to tell them what to do.

760
00:42:03,445 --> 00:42:05,886
why you're bringing them in in the first place.

761
00:42:05,886 --> 00:42:08,027
So it's always a matter of finding that balance,

762
00:42:08,027 --> 00:42:10,508
designing things in a way that will be evocative,

763
00:42:10,508 --> 00:42:14,550
but letting your actors do what they are there to do.

764
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:19,212
Having the camera itself on set with the actors

765
00:42:19,212 --> 00:42:20,993
is also a huge bonus.

766
00:42:20,993 --> 00:42:24,554
Actors kind of have a broken psychological approach

767
00:42:24,554 --> 00:42:26,035
to how they look at the set around them.

768
00:42:26,395 --> 00:42:28,756
They have one side looking at their actors,

769
00:42:28,756 --> 00:42:31,936
their friend actors, working with directors

770
00:42:31,936 --> 00:42:34,237
and working with the actual emotional content,

771
00:42:34,237 --> 00:42:37,177
but they always have a mind on where the camera is.

772
00:42:37,177 --> 00:42:39,118
It allows them to dial in the performance.

773
00:42:39,118 --> 00:42:40,598
Is this gonna be a facial performance?

774
00:42:40,598 --> 00:42:42,478
Is this gonna be a full body performance?

775
00:42:42,478 --> 00:42:43,559
What am I emoting with?

776
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:44,779
Is it my voice?

777
00:42:44,779 --> 00:42:46,119
Is it my full body?

778
00:42:46,119 --> 00:42:47,860
Without that, you're just gonna get performances

779
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:50,540
that constantly feel like they're stage performances,

780
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:53,381
and that's not gonna squeeze out the kind of drama

781
00:42:53,381 --> 00:42:55,141
you can get from what the actors can do.

782
00:42:56,821 --> 00:42:59,823
What we did find though is that tight close-up scenes,

783
00:42:59,823 --> 00:43:02,124
which are supposed to be the most dramatic ones,

784
00:43:02,124 --> 00:43:05,246
and they are, are the trickiest ones.

785
00:43:05,246 --> 00:43:05,506
Because...

786
00:43:06,922 --> 00:43:09,522
you have to use the actor's motion

787
00:43:09,522 --> 00:43:11,683
in order to motivate the camera to move

788
00:43:11,683 --> 00:43:14,364
and keep it looking seamless.

789
00:43:14,364 --> 00:43:16,205
So we have to dictate to the actors

790
00:43:16,205 --> 00:43:19,526
a lot more of what to do within their performance.

791
00:43:19,526 --> 00:43:21,606
And thankful we had really understanding actors

792
00:43:21,606 --> 00:43:22,927
that totally understood the challenge,

793
00:43:22,927 --> 00:43:24,627
so they were totally game to do this.

794
00:43:24,627 --> 00:43:26,768
But again, it's a matter of finding that balance.

795
00:43:26,768 --> 00:43:28,409
Let's take a look at a close-up scene

796
00:43:28,409 --> 00:43:29,149
and how those look.

797
00:43:29,149 --> 00:43:29,989
This weapon, any weapon, comes from here.

798
00:43:36,933 --> 00:43:40,097
But only when tempered by this.

799
00:43:40,097 --> 00:43:44,783
By the discipline, the self-control of the one who wields it.

800
00:43:44,783 --> 00:43:49,649
That is where the true strength of a warrior lies.

801
00:43:49,649 --> 00:43:51,010
You must never forget that.

802
00:43:56,571 --> 00:43:59,973
So every head bob, head nod, hand gesture,

803
00:43:59,973 --> 00:44:03,256
posture and positioning was explicitly designed

804
00:44:03,256 --> 00:44:06,518
in the scene just because the scene was so tight.

805
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:08,119
And again, that was much more challenging

806
00:44:08,119 --> 00:44:09,300
in order to create that balance

807
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:11,161
and allow our performers to perform.

808
00:44:11,161 --> 00:44:16,385
So some key takeaways from this process,

809
00:44:16,385 --> 00:44:19,047
from this attempt, and hopefully successful attempt,

810
00:44:19,047 --> 00:44:20,588
to create a really engaging

811
00:44:20,588 --> 00:44:23,650
and empathetic continuous experience.

812
00:44:25,303 --> 00:44:27,964
From a level design and art standpoint,

813
00:44:27,964 --> 00:44:31,425
approaching your designs like Disneyland design

814
00:44:31,425 --> 00:44:33,266
is incredibly helpful.

815
00:44:33,266 --> 00:44:36,427
Use your environments to hide and reveal content

816
00:44:36,427 --> 00:44:38,808
that has emotional impact to your storyline.

817
00:44:38,808 --> 00:44:42,269
Don't just lay things out in a way that they are

818
00:44:42,269 --> 00:44:44,850
open for exploration and game content.

819
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:46,171
Think of the story they deliver.

820
00:44:47,151 --> 00:44:52,033
From a lighting standpoint, we need to start looking beyond the idea of lighting for clarity,

821
00:44:52,033 --> 00:44:55,234
lighting for guidance, or lighting for beauty.

822
00:44:55,234 --> 00:45:00,957
But we actually have to think of lighting as a tool to tell an emotional story.

823
00:45:00,957 --> 00:45:03,458
And again, that goes back to traditional cinematography.

824
00:45:03,458 --> 00:45:08,800
From a writing standpoint, the idea of taking your writers and putting them somewhere and

825
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,721
taking your game designers and putting them somewhere else and at the end combining everything

826
00:45:12,721 --> 00:45:14,422
together and everything's going to be great.

827
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,361
We've got to get past that.

828
00:45:16,361 --> 00:45:18,961
Your writers need to work in lockstep

829
00:45:18,961 --> 00:45:21,342
with your game designers and your level designers

830
00:45:21,342 --> 00:45:23,742
and your Disney designs in order to go

831
00:45:23,742 --> 00:45:29,164
beyond the idea of just designing for plot points,

832
00:45:29,164 --> 00:45:31,645
but for character arcs, for how things actually

833
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:34,045
relate to each other from a gameplay and narrative

834
00:45:34,045 --> 00:45:34,405
standpoint.

835
00:45:34,405 --> 00:45:36,926
From an animation point of view, and this

836
00:45:36,926 --> 00:45:40,247
is mostly from the cinematic animation side,

837
00:45:40,247 --> 00:45:42,707
we have over 100 years of filmmaking

838
00:45:42,707 --> 00:45:44,428
to draw from and understand how.

839
00:45:44,744 --> 00:45:49,047
they took visual content to drive emotional delivery.

840
00:45:49,047 --> 00:45:54,151
While not all these techniques are 100% applicable to game design,

841
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:58,634
each of them has some level of wisdom that we can utilize

842
00:45:58,634 --> 00:46:04,238
and help to elevate our emotional content through our game cinematography.

843
00:46:04,238 --> 00:46:07,140
We have to bring in those dedicated disciplines in our teams.

844
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:09,021
We have to bring in that training.

845
00:46:11,542 --> 00:46:13,622
If you want to hear a little bit more about this,

846
00:46:13,622 --> 00:46:15,363
you should go to Erica Pinto's talk tomorrow.

847
00:46:15,363 --> 00:46:18,524
She will be discussing these kinds of issues

848
00:46:18,524 --> 00:46:21,906
more from the animation side, cinematic animation.

849
00:46:21,906 --> 00:46:23,286
She's our cinematic animation lead.

850
00:46:23,286 --> 00:46:26,207
From a team alignment standpoint,

851
00:46:26,207 --> 00:46:29,628
if you do want to hit a goal as crazy

852
00:46:29,628 --> 00:46:31,469
as not cutting a camera,

853
00:46:31,469 --> 00:46:33,450
you have to think of the impact it has

854
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:35,191
for every single one of the teams

855
00:46:35,191 --> 00:46:37,652
that are going to be engaged within this challenge.

856
00:46:38,305 --> 00:46:40,727
You have to get buy-in from each one of these teams early,

857
00:46:40,727 --> 00:46:42,948
and you have to design pipelines that will allow you

858
00:46:42,948 --> 00:46:45,930
to track data between all of these teams,

859
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:49,412
not just internally within one team on its own.

860
00:46:49,412 --> 00:46:51,313
And again, going back to Previs,

861
00:46:51,313 --> 00:46:53,815
having a very clear visual target

862
00:46:53,815 --> 00:46:56,717
that helps everybody moving in the same direction

863
00:46:56,717 --> 00:46:59,599
is gonna be critical.

864
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:01,820
I'm incredibly proud of what we did in God of War.

865
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:03,941
I really feel like we pushed some very heavy envelopes.

866
00:47:05,057 --> 00:47:08,280
But this kind of media can go far, far beyond the idea of

867
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,121
empathetic immersion.

868
00:47:09,121 --> 00:47:13,364
We have to really grab the kind of tech that's at our

869
00:47:13,364 --> 00:47:13,625
doorstep.

870
00:47:13,625 --> 00:47:16,807
We're going to be able to render photorealism in the

871
00:47:16,807 --> 00:47:18,529
very near future.

872
00:47:18,529 --> 00:47:21,691
We have to challenge the norms and evolve our media.

873
00:47:23,053 --> 00:47:32,139
We truly have the capability of being one of the most emotionally engaging modes of emotional delivery.

874
00:47:32,139 --> 00:47:37,123
We have both the means and the tools to be a new type of art form.

875
00:47:37,123 --> 00:47:37,483
Thank you.

876
00:47:37,483 --> 00:47:50,991
Thank you.

877
00:47:54,738 --> 00:47:55,259
How you doing?

878
00:47:55,259 --> 00:47:56,420
Great talk.

879
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:58,542
A lot of great information there.

880
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:01,144
I just had a quick question.

881
00:48:01,144 --> 00:48:04,687
During production, did you develop any specific hardware

882
00:48:04,687 --> 00:48:07,609
to help you with this type of these movements?

883
00:48:07,609 --> 00:48:09,050
I know in behind the scenes stuff,

884
00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:11,512
I've seen the hand-held camera you're using.

885
00:48:11,512 --> 00:48:15,176
But if there was any specifics that you were able to share,

886
00:48:15,176 --> 00:48:16,377
I'd be curious.

887
00:48:16,754 --> 00:48:23,096
Yeah, absolutely. So the concept of virtual cinematography has been out for a while.

888
00:48:23,096 --> 00:48:32,859
We just explored with different types of rigs on virtual cameras on how to comfortably get the kind of visual data we wanted from holding a system.

889
00:48:32,859 --> 00:48:38,061
And then figure out how to take that and utilize it in our animation pipeline.

890
00:48:40,759 --> 00:48:44,462
I would say we took about probably a couple of months to dial that in.

891
00:48:44,462 --> 00:48:47,145
But honestly, it's just like designing any other camera rig.

892
00:48:47,145 --> 00:48:50,288
It's just instead of recording an image, you're recording motion.

893
00:48:50,288 --> 00:48:50,468
Cool.

894
00:48:50,468 --> 00:48:50,829
Thank you.

895
00:48:50,829 --> 00:48:52,571
Yeah, no worries.

896
00:48:52,571 --> 00:48:52,671
Hi.

897
00:48:53,490 --> 00:48:57,312
I'm curious on how different your techniques were,

898
00:48:57,312 --> 00:49:01,435
or similar, for scenes that were during interactive moments

899
00:49:01,435 --> 00:49:02,236
in the game.

900
00:49:02,236 --> 00:49:04,658
Because I recall there was one scene in particular

901
00:49:04,658 --> 00:49:08,380
in Helheim when they were climbing past Baldur,

902
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:10,602
and he was giving a monologue.

903
00:49:10,602 --> 00:49:15,305
That stuck out to me, and it was during an interactive moment.

904
00:49:15,305 --> 00:49:18,107
So I was wondering if the techniques you use are similar.

905
00:49:18,107 --> 00:49:18,207
Right.

906
00:49:18,207 --> 00:49:20,769
Those techniques are actually very different.

907
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:25,070
Those moments are probably the hardest to design

908
00:49:25,070 --> 00:49:27,991
because you want to both control the image

909
00:49:27,991 --> 00:49:31,912
and allow the viewer the sense of exploration.

910
00:49:31,912 --> 00:49:34,552
So that goes back into level design.

911
00:49:34,552 --> 00:49:38,053
We designed the environment in a way that, by exploring it,

912
00:49:38,053 --> 00:49:40,493
we know where you're going to be looking.

913
00:49:40,493 --> 00:49:43,394
And we designed it in a way that it's going to show and hide

914
00:49:43,394 --> 00:49:46,135
based on some measured cadence,

915
00:49:46,135 --> 00:49:48,875
the moments we wanted to show from the actual visual story.

916
00:49:48,875 --> 00:49:49,635
Thank you.

917
00:49:52,081 --> 00:49:52,361
Hello.

918
00:49:52,361 --> 00:49:54,802
I actually wanted to know about the previous work

919
00:49:54,802 --> 00:50:00,185
you did for the dragon fighting scene.

920
00:50:00,185 --> 00:50:02,367
I wanted to know how that was done.

921
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:05,008
Did you create some sort of a 3D model for that?

922
00:50:05,008 --> 00:50:05,488
How did you do it?

923
00:50:05,488 --> 00:50:06,229
Which scene?

924
00:50:06,229 --> 00:50:07,529
The dragon fighting scene.

925
00:50:07,529 --> 00:50:09,511
Oh, the dragon fighting scene.

926
00:50:09,511 --> 00:50:12,392
Actually, that was done heavily by our gameplay animators.

927
00:50:13,259 --> 00:50:17,763
Those scenes are driven very heavily by combat design.

928
00:50:17,763 --> 00:50:20,765
Once the beats of the scene are kind of locked down,

929
00:50:20,765 --> 00:50:24,668
that's when my team comes in and polishes up the visuals

930
00:50:24,668 --> 00:50:27,711
to make sure they speak within the same visual language.

931
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:31,494
But again, those are heavily driven by level design

932
00:50:31,494 --> 00:50:33,876
and combat to make sure that the gameplay is fun

933
00:50:33,876 --> 00:50:36,498
and then that it also delivers the right visual story.

934
00:50:36,498 --> 00:50:36,818
Okay, thank you.

935
00:50:36,818 --> 00:50:36,878
Hey.

936
00:50:42,509 --> 00:50:53,021
Did you at one point make some tests or something to check if the one take thing is really the right approach?

937
00:50:53,021 --> 00:50:57,406
Did you try to shoot some scenes with cuts or did you like, fuck it?

938
00:50:57,406 --> 00:51:00,210
Right. I mean, man, I wish I could.

939
00:51:01,825 --> 00:51:05,749
The mandate to not cut actually came from Corey, our game director.

940
00:51:05,749 --> 00:51:09,052
He didn't tell us how to do it, he just told us, just do it.

941
00:51:09,052 --> 00:51:16,899
So I could never just go, hey, you know what, screw this, I'm just going to start cutting again.

942
00:51:16,899 --> 00:51:19,681
I can tell you there were many times I very much wanted to.

943
00:51:19,681 --> 00:51:26,808
But all the tests we did were always towards making sure that the runner is going to work.

944
00:51:35,238 --> 00:51:35,938
Hi.

945
00:51:35,938 --> 00:51:37,819
Whoops, that's quite difficult.

946
00:51:37,819 --> 00:51:38,779
First of all, thank you so much

947
00:51:38,779 --> 00:51:40,979
for making such a beautiful game.

948
00:51:40,979 --> 00:51:43,220
I have a question about analytic

949
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:46,861
and the empathy and emotional connection to the game.

950
00:51:46,861 --> 00:51:50,922
So were you able to analyze whether the users

951
00:51:50,922 --> 00:51:54,703
or gamers having the emotional connection

952
00:51:54,703 --> 00:51:56,464
that you expected?

953
00:51:56,464 --> 00:51:58,404
So based on the scenario you expected,

954
00:51:58,404 --> 00:52:01,045
oh, they are gonna cry at this point.

955
00:52:01,045 --> 00:52:04,206
Were you able to analyze based on analytics?

956
00:52:04,398 --> 00:52:12,386
Right. So we didn't have quantified analytics for the emotional side. That's something that I

957
00:52:12,386 --> 00:52:16,931
believe we're going to be pushing a little bit more into. But we did use our team as guinea

958
00:52:16,931 --> 00:52:17,211
pigs.

959
00:52:18,415 --> 00:52:23,280
So we try to work when we did push a scene toward a level of completion in some level

960
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:28,784
of isolation so we have enough people to be able to view it and gauge their engagement.

961
00:52:28,784 --> 00:52:31,947
And sometimes we did get feedback that it's not impactful enough.

962
00:52:31,947 --> 00:52:37,271
And it was up to us and the experience we bring in to figure out how to fix that.

963
00:52:37,271 --> 00:52:38,132
Thank you.

964
00:52:38,132 --> 00:52:38,532
All right.

965
00:52:40,998 --> 00:52:43,499
So you mentioned early on that you're,

966
00:52:43,499 --> 00:52:45,680
you called it a theory of how you can blend

967
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:49,301
the immersion in the game and empathy

968
00:52:49,301 --> 00:52:51,301
to create something special for players.

969
00:52:51,301 --> 00:52:53,322
I was curious if there was a moment where you felt

970
00:52:53,322 --> 00:52:55,642
like that theory was proved in the development cycle

971
00:52:55,642 --> 00:52:58,683
for you, whether it was a certain scene

972
00:52:58,683 --> 00:53:00,883
or a certain challenge your team was going through,

973
00:53:00,883 --> 00:53:01,704
anything like that.

974
00:53:01,704 --> 00:53:02,824
Right.

975
00:53:04,726 --> 00:53:07,028
Honestly, it's really hard to quantify.

976
00:53:07,028 --> 00:53:11,572
It's easier to find when it breaks than when it works, as

977
00:53:11,572 --> 00:53:13,253
weird as that may sound.

978
00:53:13,253 --> 00:53:16,916
A good example would be the moment, again, our E3 trailer

979
00:53:16,916 --> 00:53:22,401
was when we put our things out there to see if they work.

980
00:53:22,401 --> 00:53:25,324
Within the E3 trailer, there was a moment where the sun

981
00:53:25,324 --> 00:53:25,804
kills a deer.

982
00:53:27,288 --> 00:53:32,491
And that was a moment that was both immersive and sympathetic.

983
00:53:32,491 --> 00:53:38,875
And we wanted to see if it brought people to tears.

984
00:53:38,875 --> 00:53:41,076
And thankfully, it did.

985
00:53:41,076 --> 00:53:42,477
So for me, that was one of the moments

986
00:53:42,477 --> 00:53:43,878
where I knew that we're probably onto something.

987
00:53:43,878 --> 00:53:44,498
We can make this work.

988
00:53:44,498 --> 00:53:44,979
Yeah.

989
00:53:44,979 --> 00:53:46,220
You needed an audience test.

990
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:46,280
Yes.

991
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:50,582
That's always the case.

992
00:53:50,582 --> 00:53:51,503
Thank you.

993
00:53:51,503 --> 00:53:51,703
Mm-hmm.

994
00:53:51,703 --> 00:53:52,323
OK.

995
00:53:52,323 --> 00:53:52,383
Hi.

996
00:53:52,734 --> 00:53:57,278
I was just wondering, since you said that there's a few times that you really wanted to cut,

997
00:53:57,278 --> 00:54:02,442
what was like a really difficult moment for you to follow this rule?

998
00:54:02,442 --> 00:54:02,922
Oh, if I can make, oh man.

999
00:54:02,922 --> 00:54:05,124
Like the most difficult, if nothing else.

1000
00:54:05,124 --> 00:54:07,666
I don't think, I can think of the most difficult.

1001
00:54:07,666 --> 00:54:11,088
When it's difficult, it's just difficult.

1002
00:54:11,088 --> 00:54:15,172
The scene I showed you as an example, that opening scene,

1003
00:54:15,172 --> 00:54:20,396
opening moment for the scene where Freya uses the heart to heal the son.

1004
00:54:21,710 --> 00:54:26,293
That was so incredibly difficult and that was just the beginning of the scene.

1005
00:54:26,293 --> 00:54:28,274
We even came up with ideas on how to cut.

1006
00:54:28,274 --> 00:54:31,416
Of course we never did it.

1007
00:54:31,416 --> 00:54:34,458
But I would say that would be a good example.

1008
00:54:35,529 --> 00:54:40,132
I was curious, just so much of the feel and flow of the game is based around this camera work,

1009
00:54:40,132 --> 00:54:43,473
but you said a lot of the, or most of the camera work came from the mocap sessions.

1010
00:54:43,473 --> 00:54:49,116
In traditional game development, mocap doesn't usually get integrated until a lot later on,

1011
00:54:49,116 --> 00:54:54,639
so I was wondering, during development, I imagine there was large areas that didn't have this data yet.

1012
00:54:54,639 --> 00:54:58,461
Did it make it difficult to test and play the game and see if it was feeling good

1013
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:01,263
if you didn't have a lot of this camera stuff coming in until later?

1014
00:55:01,443 --> 00:55:06,686
Absolutely. So again, that goes back to, I touched upon that a little briefly.

1015
00:55:06,686 --> 00:55:13,851
We did everything we could to get something from the environment artist or level designers

1016
00:55:13,851 --> 00:55:16,813
or any other team that has to do with the world building

1017
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:21,517
to give us context of what it is we're going to be shooting in.

1018
00:55:21,517 --> 00:55:25,259
And then we use that in our previs.

1019
00:55:25,259 --> 00:55:29,662
So we try to find the best way we could based on what we had at hand.

1020
00:55:30,442 --> 00:55:32,703
to figure out how the scene is going to feel.

1021
00:55:32,703 --> 00:55:35,466
And then it was up to us to make sure we maintain

1022
00:55:35,466 --> 00:55:38,108
that vision throughout the entire production.

1023
00:55:38,108 --> 00:55:39,689
When the environments come in,

1024
00:55:39,689 --> 00:55:40,971
when the final characters come in,

1025
00:55:40,971 --> 00:55:44,514
but we knew how it was gonna look way beforehand,

1026
00:55:44,514 --> 00:55:45,655
if that answers your question.

1027
00:55:47,321 --> 00:55:53,345
It mostly does. I was more curious like how for the rest of the team who was waiting to see your stuff in the game

1028
00:55:53,345 --> 00:55:57,588
I guess like I was affecting them having it being probably not there

1029
00:55:57,588 --> 00:56:00,129
Especially if your previs was not done in 3d software

1030
00:56:00,129 --> 00:56:02,711
So you couldn't just stick the previs into the game, right?

1031
00:56:02,711 --> 00:56:08,674
Having said that there are solutions for that as well, but it was mostly verbal communication for for God of War

1032
00:56:08,674 --> 00:56:11,776
It was about just staying very tight within the teams

1033
00:56:11,776 --> 00:56:12,037
Thanks

1034
00:56:12,037 --> 00:56:12,297
I hate

1035
00:56:16,830 --> 00:56:23,033
A quick question on, so one of the big downsides of a one-er is the, is basically the shoe

1036
00:56:23,033 --> 00:56:25,154
leather that you have to kind of fill between.

1037
00:56:25,154 --> 00:56:28,656
Were you intimate in conversations with the writing team and the production design team

1038
00:56:28,656 --> 00:56:35,160
when you're blocking out scenes to kind of cut the fat between moments to make the scenes

1039
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:37,021
not feel as drawn out?

1040
00:56:37,181 --> 00:56:43,303
Right. It was definitely a challenge in the beginning. Our writers never wrote for

1041
00:56:43,303 --> 00:56:49,124
Wunners, but as we were starting to do back and forth very early on in production, they

1042
00:56:49,124 --> 00:56:54,226
found their way to find that cadence by knowing how I approached their content. So as

1043
00:56:54,226 --> 00:57:00,507
production picked up, it was mostly about, hey, maybe we can take that line and move it

1044
00:57:00,507 --> 00:57:04,169
down because then I can motivate the camera better. But other than that, it was all

1045
00:57:04,169 --> 00:57:06,049
about finding business for the character.

1046
00:57:06,861 --> 00:57:10,703
in order to fill in these moments and maintain pacing.

1047
00:57:10,703 --> 00:57:14,305
And that's when blocking really, really was critical.

1048
00:57:14,305 --> 00:57:17,447
Hi, did you create any 2D animatics, like with storyboards,

1049
00:57:17,447 --> 00:57:22,850
or did you mainly go straight to live action style?

1050
00:57:22,850 --> 00:57:24,091
So we did try.

1051
00:57:24,091 --> 00:57:28,193
What we did find is because there is so much

1052
00:57:28,193 --> 00:57:34,336
camera movement and such complex camera movement

1053
00:57:34,336 --> 00:57:35,417
to do a runner,

1054
00:57:36,312 --> 00:57:38,453
It is, I wouldn't say virtually impossible,

1055
00:57:38,453 --> 00:57:40,333
but incredibly difficult to portray that in 2D.

1056
00:57:40,333 --> 00:57:45,154
It was really, really critical for us

1057
00:57:45,154 --> 00:57:49,896
to find the exact moments and compositions

1058
00:57:49,896 --> 00:57:52,616
where people end up in real world space.

1059
00:57:52,616 --> 00:57:56,857
And we found that if the storyboard artist was too loose,

1060
00:57:56,857 --> 00:57:59,758
they might paint us into corners we can't actually do.

1061
00:57:59,758 --> 00:58:01,478
Because we can't just use shot to shot to shot.

1062
00:58:02,236 --> 00:58:15,053
So we tried it and it turned out to be more time consuming than any other previous option we had.

1063
00:58:15,053 --> 00:58:18,257
We ended up not doing it.

1064
00:58:18,517 --> 00:58:25,521
talk about three mediums. First, textbooks or like novels where player feels the

1065
00:58:25,521 --> 00:58:31,165
immersion very deeply because all of there is a imagination of a player but

1066
00:58:31,165 --> 00:58:36,969
player or reader can't really control the antagonist or protagonist, right? So

1067
00:58:36,969 --> 00:58:42,393
there it kind of breaks the immersion or like there is some desire to be left there.

1068
00:58:43,067 --> 00:58:48,733
for games where player actually controls the person they are playing,

1069
00:58:48,733 --> 00:58:56,540
but now the creator also gets a chance to represent the scene how they want to be presented,

1070
00:58:56,540 --> 00:59:00,324
which we have seen with God of War and many other awesome games.

1071
00:59:00,324 --> 00:59:05,729
So now here there is an immersion as well as control both from the player.

1072
00:59:06,330 --> 00:59:13,098
And now, upcoming technology which is going towards VR and virtual reality,

1073
00:59:13,098 --> 00:59:18,164
you are feeling more and more immersive in virtual world,

1074
00:59:18,164 --> 00:59:24,632
but now creator lose the control over the camera and how the camera actually works.

1075
00:59:25,072 --> 00:59:27,114
is authored there.

1076
00:59:27,114 --> 00:59:32,978
Do you think it would affect largely on immersion?

1077
00:59:32,978 --> 00:59:37,561
Because it kind of feels like for a long time,

1078
00:59:37,561 --> 00:59:41,023
video games as a medium of entertainment

1079
00:59:41,023 --> 00:59:45,166
is going to be on a pinnacle of giving highest immersion

1080
00:59:45,166 --> 00:59:47,967
and highest connection compared to this other two.

1081
00:59:47,967 --> 00:59:49,328
So what are your thoughts on it?

1082
00:59:50,217 --> 00:59:57,423
So to understand your question, you want to see how videos might move forward to push

1083
00:59:57,423 --> 00:59:58,904
immersion?

1084
00:59:58,904 --> 00:59:59,004
Uh-huh.

1085
00:59:59,004 --> 01:00:03,448
Especially talking about virtual reality, where you actually lose the control over camera.

1086
01:00:03,448 --> 01:00:03,708
Right.

1087
01:00:03,708 --> 01:00:08,512
So virtual reality is a pretty separate topic.

1088
01:00:08,512 --> 01:00:09,132
Yeah.

1089
01:00:09,132 --> 01:00:14,196
Virtual reality is not only a first-person experience, but it is your experience.

1090
01:00:14,196 --> 01:00:18,019
I don't think that a controlled experience, like traditional cinematics, would ever work

1091
01:00:18,019 --> 01:00:18,299
in VR.

1092
01:00:19,402 --> 01:00:23,162
Also, we can't change the camera aspect in VR

1093
01:00:23,162 --> 01:00:25,503
because it has to represent how we actually view the world

1094
01:00:25,503 --> 01:00:27,043
with our own eyeballs.

1095
01:00:27,043 --> 01:00:32,404
So our thought of VR as cinematography is very different,

1096
01:00:32,404 --> 01:00:34,804
and that goes a little bit more towards

1097
01:00:34,804 --> 01:00:37,585
what I was talking about in terms of a camera-driven

1098
01:00:37,585 --> 01:00:40,226
narrative, based on where the player is

1099
01:00:40,226 --> 01:00:42,066
and what the player is looking at,

1100
01:00:42,066 --> 01:00:45,066
we can bring the world to life based on their choices.

1101
01:00:46,147 --> 01:00:52,331
But that's going to be a little different than traditional cinematography,

1102
01:00:52,331 --> 01:00:56,754
where we do control lensing and do control things that if you controlled in VR,

1103
01:00:56,754 --> 01:00:58,115
you will really disorient the player.

1104
01:00:58,115 --> 01:00:59,316
Yep, makes sense.

1105
01:00:59,316 --> 01:00:59,676
Hiya.

1106
01:00:59,676 --> 01:01:01,538
So, last question?

1107
01:01:01,538 --> 01:01:07,922
I was wondering what was the sign-off process on this project,

1108
01:01:07,922 --> 01:01:10,524
and how much did you have to reshoot?

1109
01:01:14,253 --> 01:01:14,833
in this project.

1110
01:01:14,833 --> 01:01:16,935
How much did we need to reshoot?

1111
01:01:16,935 --> 01:01:18,656
Yeah, and what was the sign-off process?

1112
01:01:18,656 --> 01:01:22,958
So we pretty much showed our previs to the directors.

1113
01:01:22,958 --> 01:01:24,179
They got to sign off.

1114
01:01:24,179 --> 01:01:26,361
The moment we got sign-off from the previs,

1115
01:01:26,361 --> 01:01:29,503
we just did our best to get the previs shot properly on set.

1116
01:01:29,503 --> 01:01:32,365
And at that point, there was merely any reshoot.

1117
01:01:32,365 --> 01:01:32,605
Thank you.

1118
01:01:32,605 --> 01:01:34,886
Awesome, thank you guys.
