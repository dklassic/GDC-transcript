00:00:03,177 --> 00:00:06,257
Welcome all to this talk about product discovery

2
00:00:06,257 --> 00:00:12,258
and integrating citizen science into EVE Online.

3
00:00:12,258 --> 00:00:16,119
Just to kind of start you off, please, you know the drill,

4
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:18,320
turn off your phones and fill out the survey

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,900
and all the nice things.

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,161
My name is Berkut Fynboson.

7
00:00:23,161 --> 00:00:24,841
People call me Berkut, like hamburgers.

8
00:00:24,841 --> 00:00:26,341
It's much easier.

9
00:00:26,341 --> 00:00:30,042
I'm a senior development manager at CCP Games in Reykjavik.

10
00:00:30,485 --> 00:00:33,388
And I'm Ottila Sonner, I'm the CEO and co-founder

11
00:00:33,388 --> 00:00:38,393
of Massively Multiplayer Online Science.

12
00:00:38,393 --> 00:00:41,216
And exactly a year ago during GDC,

13
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:45,500
we launched a new project, codenamed Project Discovery,

14
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,544
which later became one of the biggest

15
00:00:48,544 --> 00:00:50,085
citizen science efforts in 2016.

16
00:00:51,545 --> 00:00:55,388
This is even more remarkable if you consider the fact that none of the parties involved

17
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,710
had a track record in citizen science.

18
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:00,933
So how did we manage to make this work?

19
00:01:00,933 --> 00:01:06,778
Well as a teaser I can tell you that video games and gamers play a substantial role in

20
00:01:06,778 --> 00:01:07,439
the success.

21
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:13,446
But to tell you the whole story, I have to start with citizen science.

22
00:01:13,446 --> 00:01:19,594
Citizen science is the crowdsourcing of scientific data analysis or data acquisition, but I believe

23
00:01:19,594 --> 00:01:21,216
it's much more than that.

24
00:01:21,216 --> 00:01:24,380
It has a very strong educational aspect.

25
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:29,095
And also it's an invaluable tool in scientific outreach.

26
00:01:29,095 --> 00:01:32,159
It's paramount that we understand what scientists are working on,

27
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,803
even if it may be on a superficial level.

28
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,925
And what would be a better tool for that

29
00:01:36,925 --> 00:01:40,870
than to actually work on the data that scientists work with?

30
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:43,834
So citizen science, I believe, is very important.

31
00:01:45,045 --> 00:01:48,609
Now, you may have heard the term citizen science,

32
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:52,894
and I'm pretty sure you met some of these projects

33
00:01:52,894 --> 00:01:57,180
in citizen science, like the protein folding game,

34
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,305
where we try to find native structures of proteins, or...

35
00:02:02,446 --> 00:02:09,528
Zooniverse slash Galaxy Zoo, where we classify galaxies captured on Hubble deep space images.

36
00:02:09,528 --> 00:02:14,290
Actually this project became so successful, so popular, that a whole platform grew out of it,

37
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:17,871
and now they're hosting like more than 50 different projects.

38
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:22,311
Another good example is the Phylo,

39
00:02:22,311 --> 00:02:25,332
which is a project from Canada,

40
00:02:25,332 --> 00:02:28,373
from the McGill University.

41
00:02:28,373 --> 00:02:32,775
And here researchers are trying to solve

42
00:02:32,775 --> 00:02:35,396
DNA sequence alignment problems.

43
00:02:35,396 --> 00:02:39,418
And finally, a final example, iVIR,

44
00:02:39,418 --> 00:02:43,660
where we have to map the visual neurons in the human brain.

45
00:02:44,454 --> 00:02:52,138
All of these projects do an amazing job in citizen science, but they have a major problem

46
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:55,440
to tackle, and that is user engagement and retention.

47
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,021
So that's where our story started.

48
00:03:00,385 --> 00:03:02,887
Three years ago, with a friend of mine, Bernhard Revers,

49
00:03:02,887 --> 00:03:07,692
we had an idea that instead of creating standalone citizen

50
00:03:07,692 --> 00:03:14,037
science games or citizen science gamified experiences,

51
00:03:14,037 --> 00:03:16,619
why don't we take these problems and integrate them

52
00:03:16,619 --> 00:03:20,183
with the most engaging form of entertainment of today, which

53
00:03:20,183 --> 00:03:21,604
is unquestionably video games?

54
00:03:22,204 --> 00:03:25,785
integrating them with major already existing AAA titles,

55
00:03:25,785 --> 00:03:28,566
and integrate them as a seamless gaming experience.

56
00:03:28,566 --> 00:03:31,026
And our hypothesis was that if we managed to make this,

57
00:03:31,026 --> 00:03:34,267
managed to create this experience,

58
00:03:34,267 --> 00:03:39,008
managed to match the visuals, connect the dots with the lore,

59
00:03:39,008 --> 00:03:41,509
with the reward system, with the game mechanics,

60
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:43,189
and ask the pros of the game industry

61
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,269
to create an engaging experience,

62
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:49,450
then we might be able to transform a tiny percentage

63
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,631
of all the time that we spend with gaming.

64
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:53,893
to do something good in real life.

65
00:03:53,893 --> 00:03:58,837
And that tiny percentage would be a virtually limitless

66
00:03:58,837 --> 00:04:00,899
human computation engine to serve science.

67
00:04:00,899 --> 00:04:04,062
So that was our initial concept.

68
00:04:04,062 --> 00:04:07,885
And first we contacted researchers.

69
00:04:07,885 --> 00:04:11,669
We tried to validate the idea.

70
00:04:12,442 --> 00:04:14,923
We got very enthusiastic responses,

71
00:04:14,923 --> 00:04:18,185
and we met with Emma Lundberg.

72
00:04:18,185 --> 00:04:20,246
She's heading a research group in Sweden

73
00:04:20,246 --> 00:04:21,427
at the Human Protein Atlas.

74
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:26,650
They're building a big open database of microscope images.

75
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:29,852
And we immediately knew that this kind of material

76
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:32,334
would be a perfect raw material for a first project.

77
00:04:32,654 --> 00:04:36,437
She has a quarter million images, beautiful ones.

78
00:04:36,437 --> 00:04:45,563
The task of the gamer was to find or localize the green markings on the image

79
00:04:45,563 --> 00:04:50,407
that mark the location of a certain protein.

80
00:04:51,018 --> 00:04:55,844
This was one part of the job, this was actually the easier part of the job, we had a lot of friends in research.

81
00:04:55,844 --> 00:05:01,612
But the harder part was to get in touch with the gaming industry, with you guys.

82
00:05:01,612 --> 00:05:09,021
And when we had this idea, I immediately knew that EVE Online would be a perfect match for the project.

83
00:05:10,487 --> 00:05:14,129
So we started to work on that, and after a couple of months,

84
00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:16,370
I got an email from Andy Norgren,

85
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,631
she's the executive producer of EVE Online,

86
00:05:18,631 --> 00:05:22,373
that this sounds intriguing, let's have a Skype.

87
00:05:22,373 --> 00:05:28,796
So, she immediately became a huge supporter of the project,

88
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:32,277
and around 2015, November, we already flew to Reykjavik,

89
00:05:32,277 --> 00:05:34,958
and we're presenting this concept

90
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,079
to the stakeholders at CCP.

91
00:05:40,703 --> 00:05:46,444
So integrating citizen science into a AAA-established computer

92
00:05:46,444 --> 00:05:47,965
game is no easy task.

93
00:05:47,965 --> 00:05:53,566
Like Attila was saying, the EVE dev team

94
00:05:53,566 --> 00:05:57,207
was super curious about this idea and about this project.

95
00:05:57,207 --> 00:06:00,768
And for those of you that don't know EVE Online,

96
00:06:00,768 --> 00:06:03,709
EVE Online is a single-seat, massively multiplayer online

97
00:06:03,709 --> 00:06:06,690
game where hundreds of thousands of players

98
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,630
fight over power, wealth, and fame.

99
00:06:09,381 --> 00:06:14,403
And in EVE, players decide their own fate and write their

100
00:06:14,403 --> 00:06:15,163
own stories.

101
00:06:15,163 --> 00:06:20,425
But, you know, product discovery and EVE Online.

102
00:06:20,425 --> 00:06:21,565
Why?

103
00:06:21,565 --> 00:06:23,646
Well, first, because of science.

104
00:06:23,646 --> 00:06:25,706
There are all huge science buffs at CCP.

105
00:06:25,706 --> 00:06:30,708
And for myself, my kind of first interaction with

106
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:34,149
crowdsourced science was this beautiful thing called

107
00:06:34,149 --> 00:06:35,390
SETIatHome.

108
00:06:37,232 --> 00:06:40,194
I think this was like back in 1999 or something.

109
00:06:40,194 --> 00:06:42,496
And me and my best friend used to sit and watch this

110
00:06:42,496 --> 00:06:45,918
for hours, looking for aliens in faraway galaxies.

111
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:49,120
We were actually on dial-up modem,

112
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,882
so his mom was not happy when she got the phone bill.

113
00:06:51,882 --> 00:06:55,344
But hey, science.

114
00:06:55,344 --> 00:06:59,447
But the thing, there was no interaction with this.

115
00:06:59,447 --> 00:07:01,888
This was just something you watched,

116
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:03,629
and it just kind of chucked along.

117
00:07:04,835 --> 00:07:06,876
We kind of, you know, while we were looking at this,

118
00:07:06,876 --> 00:07:08,397
we were kind of, you know, we were talking about it,

119
00:07:08,397 --> 00:07:10,517
and we were kind of role-playing this whole thing.

120
00:07:10,517 --> 00:07:13,038
And, you know, of course, playing, at that time,

121
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:17,140
a lot of XCOM apocalypse, I think it was, you know,

122
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,040
because we had to prepare for the invasion.

123
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,981
So it had kind of been, you know, stuck in my mind

124
00:07:21,981 --> 00:07:23,442
for quite some time,

125
00:07:23,442 --> 00:07:25,803
long before I started the gaming industry.

126
00:07:25,803 --> 00:07:28,824
It's like, how can you actually merge these two together?

127
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:32,065
So when Attila called, I was super stoked.

128
00:07:32,065 --> 00:07:33,766
And this is a...

129
00:07:35,077 --> 00:07:37,797
This is a really interesting game design challenge.

130
00:07:37,797 --> 00:07:41,898
And we really look at this as an opportunity

131
00:07:41,898 --> 00:07:44,559
to take part in something much bigger,

132
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:49,220
and who isn't up for a great challenge?

133
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,261
And we also believe that, we also

134
00:07:51,261 --> 00:07:53,101
hope that our example sets the stage

135
00:07:53,101 --> 00:07:56,662
for many other successful collaborations between science

136
00:07:56,662 --> 00:07:57,943
and gaming to come.

137
00:07:57,943 --> 00:07:59,863
So yeah.

138
00:08:00,972 --> 00:08:03,173
There were a lot of unknowns when we dove into this.

139
00:08:03,173 --> 00:08:06,793
And we really enjoy unknowns at CCP.

140
00:08:06,793 --> 00:08:10,754
And it was everything from technical unknowns

141
00:08:10,754 --> 00:08:16,315
to legal issues, very, very, very interesting legal issues.

142
00:08:16,315 --> 00:08:18,656
And also, how in the world we're going

143
00:08:18,656 --> 00:08:20,196
to design and build this thing.

144
00:08:20,196 --> 00:08:24,617
But we set four main design principles

145
00:08:24,617 --> 00:08:26,157
to guide us on this journey.

146
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:34,761
The first one was we wanted the science to be of real world

147
00:08:34,761 --> 00:08:37,524
purpose and altruistic nature.

148
00:08:37,524 --> 00:08:41,587
So drone strike analysis bad, cancer research or mapping

149
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:46,532
human proteins, good.

150
00:08:46,532 --> 00:08:49,875
It had to be aesthetically fitting and thematically

151
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,596
adoptable to fit the EVE universe.

152
00:08:52,869 --> 00:08:57,131
And so we didn't want research data with images of giraffes

153
00:08:57,131 --> 00:08:57,791
or rhinos.

154
00:08:57,791 --> 00:09:02,513
Or we didn't really want any street signs from planet Earth,

155
00:09:02,513 --> 00:09:05,695
since New Eden is very far from planet Earth.

156
00:09:05,695 --> 00:09:11,377
The task had to take consistent length of time to solve.

157
00:09:11,377 --> 00:09:13,859
We didn't want to create a moment where

158
00:09:13,859 --> 00:09:14,979
some things are like two seconds,

159
00:09:14,979 --> 00:09:18,321
and then you get like a 15 minute data set you had to

160
00:09:18,321 --> 00:09:19,621
solve.

161
00:09:21,648 --> 00:09:29,035
And the research needed a high volume of tasks.

162
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:34,099
So a quarter of a million tasks fitted the first research

163
00:09:34,099 --> 00:09:34,940
data quite well.

164
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,282
So as you've seen, the data from Human Protein Atlas is

165
00:09:37,282 --> 00:09:39,604
really beautiful.

166
00:09:39,604 --> 00:09:44,328
And actually, to a point where our director thought we had

167
00:09:44,328 --> 00:09:47,190
tinkered with the data before showing it to him.

168
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:53,902
Thematically in-game, the in-game science faction,

169
00:09:53,902 --> 00:09:57,545
Sisters of Eve, are actually researching tissue samples

170
00:09:57,545 --> 00:10:00,266
they've gotten from the mysterious drift arrays

171
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:00,787
in the game.

172
00:10:00,787 --> 00:10:04,229
They're trying to kind of make sense of these drifters.

173
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:10,372
The Sisters of Eve research group

174
00:10:10,372 --> 00:10:12,534
is led by Professor Lundberg

175
00:10:12,534 --> 00:10:14,795
and calls upon capsuleers of New Eden

176
00:10:14,795 --> 00:10:17,537
to take part in solving this scientific challenge

177
00:10:17,537 --> 00:10:19,158
through the Project Discovery interface.

178
00:10:21,398 --> 00:10:23,879
And this is really great, because you

179
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:25,959
have Professor Lindbergh in game and then

180
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,259
Professor Lindbergh in reality.

181
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:31,320
So you're kind of merging, kind of playing with merging realities

182
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,061
here.

183
00:10:34,061 --> 00:10:35,981
On time to complete, we knew that this was not

184
00:10:35,981 --> 00:10:38,681
the easiest task to understand, mapping these proteins.

185
00:10:38,681 --> 00:10:43,162
So we spent a lot of time balancing and tweaking

186
00:10:43,162 --> 00:10:47,863
and working, testing the game out on our test servers

187
00:10:47,863 --> 00:10:50,823
and getting a lot of great feedback from our players.

188
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:59,581
And yeah, there was a lot of tweaks in the first month

189
00:10:59,581 --> 00:11:00,101
of testing.

190
00:11:00,101 --> 00:11:06,404
And as I said before, the Subcellular Protein Atlas

191
00:11:06,404 --> 00:11:07,384
had around 250,000 samples.

192
00:11:07,384 --> 00:11:09,845
So we thought it was a great kind of start project

193
00:11:09,845 --> 00:11:10,626
for PRODISCOVERY.

194
00:11:10,626 --> 00:11:17,229
Our preliminary calculation gave us around two to three months

195
00:11:17,229 --> 00:11:21,190
to reach full consensus on the data.

196
00:11:21,707 --> 00:11:27,009
And we were proven wrong, but I won't spoil it.

197
00:11:27,009 --> 00:11:28,170
I won't spill the beans for Attila.

198
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:30,591
He will have something fun for him to talk about.

199
00:11:30,591 --> 00:11:34,593
So actually, how did we build this thing?

200
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:39,655
We partnered up with Reykjavik University, the computer

201
00:11:39,655 --> 00:11:41,636
science department at Reykjavik University, to work

202
00:11:41,636 --> 00:11:43,517
with us on this.

203
00:11:43,517 --> 00:11:46,879
And we thought it was a great opportunity to kind of

204
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:49,280
strengthen our ties with universities in Iceland.

205
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,260
And kind of, you know, it's.

206
00:11:50,935 --> 00:11:55,720
kind of goes a full circle then.

207
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:01,607
So this is the first version of Eve Citizen Science.

208
00:12:01,607 --> 00:12:06,792
This was a web browser version we showed at FanFest.

209
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:09,856
I think it was 2015 when we showed this.

210
00:12:09,856 --> 00:12:10,797
Yeah, so.

211
00:12:11,737 --> 00:12:15,178
And yeah, we showed the first version at EVE FanFest 2015.

212
00:12:15,178 --> 00:12:19,179
Got a lot of great feedback there.

213
00:12:19,179 --> 00:12:21,860
Then took it to EVE Vegas and launched it

214
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,100
on CC, which is our test server.

215
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:29,842
And then launched it exactly a year ago.

216
00:12:33,477 --> 00:12:41,343
kind of the core idea of ProDiscovery is that CCP provides the framework and then MMOS

217
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:46,026
provides the content. It's kind of the link between us and the scientists and the scientists

218
00:12:46,026 --> 00:12:53,232
or the science partners provide the content for this frame. This makes the whole kind

219
00:12:53,232 --> 00:12:57,254
of dependency chain really interesting because due to legal issues we are not allowed to

220
00:12:57,254 --> 00:13:00,117
host a lot of the data that's being shown here.

221
00:13:00,587 --> 00:13:04,790
And so there's a really interesting challenge of giving

222
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:08,473
away, kind of having to depend on a third party

223
00:13:08,473 --> 00:13:09,193
for your content.

224
00:13:09,193 --> 00:13:12,856
Which is always a super scary thing when you're a game

225
00:13:12,856 --> 00:13:17,480
developer, because if anyone has tried it, time to penis

226
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,080
is very short.

227
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,702
So how does it actually work in game?

228
00:13:20,702 --> 00:13:28,448
While you play EVE Online, you can launch the Pro Discovery

229
00:13:28,448 --> 00:13:29,689
window and play.

230
00:13:31,032 --> 00:13:38,194
And this is because of the time to complete is relatively

231
00:13:38,194 --> 00:13:42,136
short, it's a great thing you can do while doing things that

232
00:13:42,136 --> 00:13:45,117
take a long time, such as mining, or when you're

233
00:13:45,117 --> 00:13:47,518
traveling between places, or just hanging around in

234
00:13:47,518 --> 00:13:48,478
stations chatting to people.

235
00:13:48,478 --> 00:13:52,239
So it's kind of a good side project to work on.

236
00:13:56,136 --> 00:14:06,345
So when you open the interface, you get an image of a cell sample, and your task is to identify where the green-marked proteins...

237
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:12,169
Yeah, where the green proteins sit.

238
00:14:12,169 --> 00:14:16,213
For example here, it's in the nucleus, I think.

239
00:14:16,213 --> 00:14:17,314
Yeah, nucleus, probably.

240
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:20,196
Now someone called me out.

241
00:14:20,196 --> 00:14:24,560
So yeah, you pick the categories on...

242
00:14:25,572 --> 00:14:29,834
you're right, and once you kind of feel confident,

243
00:14:29,834 --> 00:14:32,635
you submit your answer,

244
00:14:32,635 --> 00:14:36,156
and the answer is analyzed against

245
00:14:36,156 --> 00:14:39,638
all the other analysis submitted for that sample.

246
00:14:39,638 --> 00:14:41,218
That then gives you feedback on your submission.

247
00:14:48,817 --> 00:14:51,857
In this case here, we picked the correct answer.

248
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:55,539
You can have multiple answers, which makes this exponentially

249
00:14:55,539 --> 00:15:02,801
more difficult. But to actually calculate accuracy and to

250
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:08,202
reward you, there are around 15% of all tasks in Pro Discovery

251
00:15:08,202 --> 00:15:16,565
are what we call pre-solved or gold standard tasks that we use

252
00:15:16,565 --> 00:15:17,845
to, yeah, judge your accuracy.

253
00:15:19,368 --> 00:15:21,149
and reward you accordingly.

254
00:15:21,149 --> 00:15:27,194
When you reach a new level, so you basically level up slowly.

255
00:15:27,194 --> 00:15:30,696
You gain experience point and level up slowly.

256
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:33,438
And when you reach a new level, you

257
00:15:33,438 --> 00:15:38,482
get something called analysis credits, which then you

258
00:15:38,482 --> 00:15:43,186
can spend to buy some awesome rewards that you can't get

259
00:15:43,186 --> 00:15:45,407
anywhere else, but while you play this thing.

260
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:57,872
So actually on the gold standard, what's quite interesting is because we can't host any of the images,

261
00:15:57,872 --> 00:16:03,735
the gold standard tasks are balanced by the scientists.

262
00:16:03,735 --> 00:16:12,199
So that creates a lot of really interesting back and forth between us as game developers

263
00:16:12,199 --> 00:16:15,681
and the scientists and kind of talking about game best practices.

264
00:16:15,681 --> 00:16:21,664
And I think the HPA guys are, you know, they're becoming like super game developers slowly.

265
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:29,058
And so once a sample reaches a significant level of agreement,

266
00:16:29,058 --> 00:16:31,340
we can say with some certainty that it

267
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,002
has reached a consensus.

268
00:16:36,605 --> 00:16:44,192
Yeah, so the sample actually lives in a database until that consensus has been reached.

269
00:16:44,192 --> 00:16:49,296
And this can mean anything between 15 to 50 submissions of each sample.

270
00:16:49,296 --> 00:16:52,699
So the dataset, you know, even if the dataset is 250,000 images,

271
00:16:52,699 --> 00:16:54,761
it's actually 250,000 times 15 to 50.

272
00:16:54,761 --> 00:16:57,403
So it's a relatively big, big task.

273
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:04,722
And I thought to get our hands a bit more dirty

274
00:17:04,722 --> 00:17:07,784
with technical details.

275
00:17:07,784 --> 00:17:10,447
We created a platform that on one side

276
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:13,610
standardizing the data and the problem types that

277
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:15,752
comes from research, and the other side,

278
00:17:15,752 --> 00:17:19,695
it provides an API for game developers, which is important

279
00:17:19,695 --> 00:17:20,176
because.

280
00:17:20,876 --> 00:17:26,601
You can focus on creating the user interface and an engaging experience for your players

281
00:17:26,601 --> 00:17:32,406
and you don't have to be swarmed by the details of the citizen science process itself.

282
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:39,237
that is very important that this part of the architecture

283
00:17:39,237 --> 00:17:42,920
is performance, so it can handle heavy load.

284
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,242
And also from a business point of view,

285
00:17:45,242 --> 00:17:47,244
it's interesting that we're a neutral party,

286
00:17:47,244 --> 00:17:50,306
so I think that way it's easier for other game developers

287
00:17:50,306 --> 00:17:52,488
to hop on board and be part of this.

288
00:17:55,072 --> 00:17:59,399
Now, I really hope that at this point you already see how cool

289
00:17:59,399 --> 00:18:03,165
and important and fun this project is, but I really want

290
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,268
to show how easy it is to integrate.

291
00:18:06,855 --> 00:18:10,959
So basically there are two things that you have to do.

292
00:18:10,959 --> 00:18:14,342
This is roughly the code that you have to call to get a task.

293
00:18:14,342 --> 00:18:18,406
From our servers, we provide you with all the information

294
00:18:18,406 --> 00:18:20,668
that you need to visualize this task.

295
00:18:20,668 --> 00:18:24,912
And then when the player is ready, you submit the task.

296
00:18:24,912 --> 00:18:27,054
Again, relatively simple.

297
00:18:28,152 --> 00:18:32,535
And our API provides you with all the information that is

298
00:18:32,535 --> 00:18:34,977
needed to show the results screen.

299
00:18:34,977 --> 00:18:40,601
We give you an accuracy score that you can use to hand out

300
00:18:40,601 --> 00:18:42,563
rewards for the players.

301
00:18:42,563 --> 00:18:47,687
So it's as simple as that, other than that you can really

302
00:18:47,687 --> 00:18:53,731
focus on building an engaging experience and connecting the

303
00:18:53,731 --> 00:18:56,393
dots with the lore and all the in-game mechanics.

304
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,420
So the results.

305
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,100
After all this preparation, you can

306
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:05,161
believe that we couldn't wait to see how players reacted

307
00:19:05,161 --> 00:19:07,502
and what's coming out of this.

308
00:19:07,502 --> 00:19:13,764
And it was way beyond our wildest imaginations.

309
00:19:13,764 --> 00:19:17,204
This is the numbers from the first day.

310
00:19:17,204 --> 00:19:21,045
We had around half a million classifications,

311
00:19:21,045 --> 00:19:24,006
and almost 15,000 images reached consensus.

312
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:31,272
This was along with about three or four hours of downtime.

313
00:19:31,272 --> 00:19:32,232
I was here at GDC.

314
00:19:32,232 --> 00:19:33,912
I couldn't come to GDC.

315
00:19:33,912 --> 00:19:36,933
I was in the hotel room with not the best internet trying

316
00:19:36,933 --> 00:19:40,254
to keep the whole thing alive.

317
00:19:40,254 --> 00:19:42,094
So it's quite interesting.

318
00:19:42,094 --> 00:19:46,455
And another nice metric is the Sisters of Eve combat suit,

319
00:19:46,455 --> 00:19:50,736
which is kind of the ultimate reward in Project Discovery.

320
00:19:50,736 --> 00:19:53,677
And we thought that it would take at least a couple of days

321
00:19:53,677 --> 00:19:55,357
to hand out one of those.

322
00:19:56,538 --> 00:20:02,422
We had to hand out 45 in the first day, which was pretty unbelievable.

323
00:20:02,422 --> 00:20:06,164
I don't remember, you had the number of how many hours we estimated?

324
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:10,707
It was 16 hours and 17 minutes to hand out the first one.

325
00:20:10,707 --> 00:20:13,169
And the second one was like two minutes later.

326
00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:19,774
So that guy, like if he wouldn't have had a toast, but rather just like dry bread.

327
00:20:20,955 --> 00:20:24,082
You would have won, so tough luck.

328
00:20:24,082 --> 00:20:26,187
Yeah, we could call it a draw, I think.

329
00:20:26,187 --> 00:20:28,312
Yeah, we could call it a draw.

330
00:20:28,312 --> 00:20:30,277
So it was pretty amazing.

331
00:20:32,742 --> 00:20:36,765
We thought that we had a quarter million images to analyze as the first batch.

332
00:20:36,765 --> 00:20:41,648
We had an estimation of two or three months.

333
00:20:41,648 --> 00:20:44,170
Again, we were very wrong with this.

334
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:49,633
Players have gone over the whole first batch in three weeks' time.

335
00:20:49,633 --> 00:20:54,176
And since then, actually, we put the same data set

336
00:20:54,937 --> 00:20:57,397
for the sixth time in the system for players to analyze,

337
00:20:57,397 --> 00:20:59,618
which is really interesting from the citizen science point

338
00:20:59,618 --> 00:21:07,921
of view to see how the different consensus, what

339
00:21:07,921 --> 00:21:11,822
is the relation between time and the different consensus

340
00:21:11,822 --> 00:21:13,322
that players are creating and so on.

341
00:21:13,322 --> 00:21:16,203
So in itself, it's really interesting research

342
00:21:16,203 --> 00:21:17,844
in citizen science.

343
00:21:17,844 --> 00:21:21,365
And as of today, we have more than 25 million classifications

344
00:21:21,365 --> 00:21:24,246
in the system, which is pretty amazing.

345
00:21:26,186 --> 00:21:29,867
From the scientific side, where researchers are still

346
00:21:29,867 --> 00:21:32,448
working on to analyze the data, there is one thing

347
00:21:32,448 --> 00:21:36,290
that Emma already published, is this.

348
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:38,951
This is a very special protein structure

349
00:21:38,951 --> 00:21:42,332
called rods and rings, for obvious reasons.

350
00:21:42,332 --> 00:21:46,734
And players have identified around 100 new protein

351
00:21:46,734 --> 00:21:49,775
candidates that play a part in this structure.

352
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:52,296
So it's already really nice.

353
00:21:52,296 --> 00:21:55,778
From a game designer point of view, I think.

354
00:21:56,926 --> 00:21:59,287
it's even more interesting how the community reacted.

355
00:21:59,287 --> 00:22:02,928
And we can say that the community embraced the project.

356
00:22:02,928 --> 00:22:07,190
They were very active, they created a lot of content,

357
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:09,611
Wiki pages, tutorial videos.

358
00:22:09,611 --> 00:22:12,772
These are some quotes from e-forums,

359
00:22:12,772 --> 00:22:15,513
which show how strong the educational aspect

360
00:22:15,513 --> 00:22:19,535
of the project was and how a great experience

361
00:22:19,535 --> 00:22:21,556
CCP created around the problem set.

362
00:22:21,556 --> 00:22:25,538
One of our favorite thing is this poetry competition.

363
00:22:26,538 --> 00:22:33,461
Which was about project discovery and I love this almost classic tubular red nucleus is blue

364
00:22:33,461 --> 00:22:39,024
But it's only the green that matters to you which actually describes perfectly what you have to do in the project

365
00:22:41,932 --> 00:22:50,154
From the researcher side, as Berggruen mentioned, we created an avatar for Emma.

366
00:22:50,154 --> 00:22:53,815
But it's not just that, but they were really active in the whole process.

367
00:22:53,815 --> 00:22:59,797
So they were communicating with the players, they were active on the forums, they were coming to FanFest.

368
00:22:59,797 --> 00:23:04,539
And, for example, they were giving a streaming lecture.

369
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:08,881
about proteomics in Yves University,

370
00:23:08,881 --> 00:23:12,342
using the same material that they used in Stockholm

371
00:23:12,342 --> 00:23:14,784
for university students to teach proteomics,

372
00:23:14,784 --> 00:23:16,545
which was a really nice crossover.

373
00:23:16,545 --> 00:23:20,747
Also, one of my favorite stories

374
00:23:20,747 --> 00:23:24,249
about how committed they were is that

375
00:23:24,249 --> 00:23:26,490
two years ago when we, at Yves Vegas,

376
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:29,331
where we showcased the first prototype,

377
00:23:30,332 --> 00:23:34,778
Emma actually cancelled her appearance at the Proteomics Conference where she was supposed

378
00:23:34,778 --> 00:23:39,164
to speak about her research and opted to come to Vegas and talk to players about this.

379
00:23:41,345 --> 00:23:46,270
And then we had a live citizen science tournament

380
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:47,832
in Reykjavik last week.

381
00:23:47,832 --> 00:23:49,113
It was a lot of fun.

382
00:23:49,113 --> 00:23:53,777
And actually Hilmar mentioned it in his closing speech

383
00:23:53,777 --> 00:23:56,961
as this being the next eSports,

384
00:23:56,961 --> 00:24:00,204
which was of course a huge exaggeration,

385
00:24:00,204 --> 00:24:01,445
but it was really nice to hear.

386
00:24:03,384 --> 00:24:09,128
And then we had a lot of articles about the project,

387
00:24:09,128 --> 00:24:12,371
both in high profile scientific journals.

388
00:24:12,371 --> 00:24:16,234
Actually, the journalist who wrote this article told me

389
00:24:16,234 --> 00:24:18,856
that this is the first time that I published a screenshot

390
00:24:18,856 --> 00:24:22,959
from video game, which is nice, I think.

391
00:24:22,959 --> 00:24:25,861
And also in mainstream media.

392
00:24:27,569 --> 00:24:33,434
Of course, this was very good for CCP, this was very good for us, for Human Protein Atlas, for the project,

393
00:24:33,434 --> 00:24:39,860
but I think having that much attention from the general public, from non-gamers,

394
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:44,864
having such positive messages in the media is very important for the whole gaming industry.

395
00:24:46,975 --> 00:24:50,318
Now a couple of words about the future.

396
00:24:50,318 --> 00:24:54,201
So we are, of course, trying to work with more and more game

397
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:55,322
developers.

398
00:24:55,322 --> 00:24:58,985
One project that I can talk of is Gearbox.

399
00:24:58,985 --> 00:25:01,607
Two years ago, I met with Randy Pitchford here at GDC,

400
00:25:01,607 --> 00:25:03,168
and he became a

401
00:25:05,307 --> 00:25:09,050
a very big fan and supporter of this whole project.

402
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:12,192
And I don't know if you've seen his presentation.

403
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:19,118
He showed some images and videos about new artistic styles

404
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:21,700
and techniques that they're experimenting with.

405
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:25,022
And we just can't wait to see how citizen science can

406
00:25:25,022 --> 00:25:26,643
be integrated with that titles.

407
00:25:28,367 --> 00:25:32,608
Another thing is this, we realize that from a higher

408
00:25:32,608 --> 00:25:35,208
perspective what we're doing, we're trying to find

409
00:25:35,208 --> 00:25:40,290
already existing, established, active online communities

410
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:42,831
and try to kind of tweak their activities a bit

411
00:25:42,831 --> 00:25:45,971
or smuggle a little bit of science in their everyday life.

412
00:25:46,692 --> 00:25:51,033
And so we thought that why don't we approach MOOCs,

413
00:25:51,033 --> 00:25:53,253
which are these big open online courses

414
00:25:53,253 --> 00:25:55,954
with tens of thousands of very enthusiastic

415
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:57,695
and motivated students,

416
00:25:57,695 --> 00:26:01,216
and why don't we bring real life scientific data

417
00:26:01,216 --> 00:26:02,776
for them to analyze.

418
00:26:02,776 --> 00:26:04,917
So in that effort, we are working together

419
00:26:04,917 --> 00:26:06,857
with the Geneva University,

420
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:10,038
and we try to bring exoplanet research data

421
00:26:10,038 --> 00:26:12,339
into their course on the subject.

422
00:26:13,219 --> 00:26:16,560
And they are a very prestigious institute on that,

423
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:21,362
because Michel Mayor, who is a professor of the university,

424
00:26:21,362 --> 00:26:25,963
is actually the researcher who found the very first exoplanet.

425
00:26:25,963 --> 00:26:28,404
So that's very interesting.

426
00:26:28,404 --> 00:26:33,065
And of course, a very important part of our future plans

427
00:26:33,065 --> 00:26:35,726
is to have new projects together with CCP.

428
00:26:43,396 --> 00:26:47,419
So with the human proton atlas project,

429
00:26:47,419 --> 00:26:49,761
it has run its course.

430
00:26:49,761 --> 00:26:56,786
So we have decided to sunset it and start

431
00:26:56,786 --> 00:26:59,247
focusing on all the research.

432
00:26:59,247 --> 00:27:02,970
And it's actually quite great, because now we've

433
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:04,431
built this framework.

434
00:27:04,431 --> 00:27:08,794
And it's now a matter of trying to find new ways to visualize

435
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:10,055
new types of data.

436
00:27:10,055 --> 00:27:12,116
And I think they're interesting.

437
00:27:12,978 --> 00:27:17,623
creative layer. So kind of the four principles that I talked about earlier,

438
00:27:17,623 --> 00:27:22,148
what we actually learned, you know, since we wrote those is that, you know,

439
00:27:22,148 --> 00:27:23,270
looking for a new project,

440
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:27,915
kind of the most important thing that we found is that we don't want to devalue

441
00:27:27,915 --> 00:27:30,858
the project as it is today.

442
00:27:32,219 --> 00:27:35,741
We have set a certain expectation standard in ProDiscovery.

443
00:27:35,741 --> 00:27:37,203
And it's not only the altruistic nature

444
00:27:37,203 --> 00:27:38,644
and the seamless connection

445
00:27:38,644 --> 00:27:40,926
that kind of pulls in the community,

446
00:27:40,926 --> 00:27:43,828
but it's also the complexity and the depth of the research.

447
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:46,330
Kind of a caveat here,

448
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:50,874
the EVE community is very open and willing to take on

449
00:27:50,874 --> 00:27:52,315
like very difficult challenges.

450
00:27:52,315 --> 00:27:54,237
And you know, they kind of,

451
00:27:54,237 --> 00:27:56,358
I don't know if you've played EVE,

452
00:27:56,358 --> 00:27:59,141
but EVE is kind of a hardcore game.

453
00:27:59,141 --> 00:27:59,921
That's, yeah.

454
00:27:59,921 --> 00:28:01,422
It's kind of a,

455
00:28:01,422 --> 00:28:01,703
maybe a

456
00:28:02,336 --> 00:28:02,956
light, yeah.

457
00:28:02,956 --> 00:28:06,859
But of course, there are plenty of simpler research projects

458
00:28:06,859 --> 00:28:10,001
out there, so you don't need to worry that you need to teach

459
00:28:10,001 --> 00:28:13,624
your players to fold proteins or something.

460
00:28:13,624 --> 00:28:21,429
So after going through a few different data sets and

461
00:28:21,429 --> 00:28:24,931
narrowing down, we managed to narrow it down to something

462
00:28:24,931 --> 00:28:26,792
that felt really close to home.

463
00:28:26,792 --> 00:28:28,894
And we were actually going to work with the University of

464
00:28:28,894 --> 00:28:29,134
Geneva.

465
00:28:29,732 --> 00:28:30,632
to search for exoplanets.

466
00:28:30,632 --> 00:28:33,894
We were going to announce it at GDC,

467
00:28:33,894 --> 00:28:38,157
but then NASA announced TRAPPIST-1 last week.

468
00:28:38,157 --> 00:28:41,099
And we were like, hey, that's kind of the same thing

469
00:28:41,099 --> 00:28:41,739
as we're doing.

470
00:28:41,739 --> 00:28:43,701
And they're also working with University of Geneva.

471
00:28:43,701 --> 00:28:45,902
So let's join up.

472
00:28:45,902 --> 00:28:49,444
So for those of you that don't know,

473
00:28:49,444 --> 00:28:55,168
exoplanets are planets orbiting suns outside our solar systems.

474
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:57,790
All the stars that you see in the sky are.

475
00:28:59,142 --> 00:29:06,467
in simple terms, suns.

476
00:29:06,467 --> 00:29:08,809
Yeah, the data set is extremely big.

477
00:29:08,809 --> 00:29:13,052
I mean, it's almost as big as the stars you see in the sky.

478
00:29:13,052 --> 00:29:17,615
But at the same time, there are some limiting factors

479
00:29:17,615 --> 00:29:18,516
and issues.

480
00:29:18,516 --> 00:29:21,458
For instance, the gold standard set

481
00:29:21,458 --> 00:29:26,042
is limited to the amount of exoplanets that we know about.

482
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:30,811
even, you know, that kind of takes the gold standard set down to a few thousands.

483
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:37,072
And even like, you know, if you want to get data sets or gold standards data in the resolution

484
00:29:37,072 --> 00:29:39,773
that we're looking for, it actually limits it even further down.

485
00:29:39,773 --> 00:29:47,935
And so Professor Lindberg will actually pass the torch over to Michel Meyer,

486
00:29:47,935 --> 00:29:53,717
who is going to be the ambassador for this new project.

487
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:56,940
an avatar in game, which is pretty cool.

488
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:01,243
And almost as cool as him getting a Wolf Prize this year

489
00:30:01,243 --> 00:30:04,986
in physics, which is also really cool.

490
00:30:04,986 --> 00:30:06,187
But yeah, like Attila was saying,

491
00:30:06,187 --> 00:30:13,252
Michel found the first exoplanet back in 1995.

492
00:30:13,252 --> 00:30:16,514
So we're really excited of getting him on board.

493
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:18,816
And he will actually be coming to FanFest this year,

494
00:30:18,816 --> 00:30:21,137
giving a talk, a super scientific talk

495
00:30:21,137 --> 00:30:21,818
about exoplanets.

496
00:30:23,124 --> 00:30:28,906
So the data that we're receiving from in this phase of ProDiscovery is

497
00:30:28,906 --> 00:30:35,310
are kind of these light curves and this is basically

498
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:38,951
in simple terms this is almost like a time lapse of a star so

499
00:30:38,951 --> 00:30:42,493
you have a telescope and it takes snapshots of the star over a period of

500
00:30:42,493 --> 00:30:47,195
time and when you kind of plot these up you

501
00:30:47,195 --> 00:30:48,596
get these beautiful light curves.

502
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:55,621
And what the players are looking for are actually dips in this

503
00:30:55,621 --> 00:30:56,962
light curve.

504
00:30:56,962 --> 00:31:00,865
And that's basically when something goes in front of the

505
00:31:00,865 --> 00:31:03,586
star and blocking the light from it.

506
00:31:03,586 --> 00:31:06,829
In science terms, this is called a transit.

507
00:31:06,829 --> 00:31:09,590
So players would be looking at transits.

508
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:14,774
And here you see a better representation of transits.

509
00:31:14,774 --> 00:31:16,215
These are like multiple transits.

510
00:31:16,215 --> 00:31:19,417
And of course, you know this thing.

511
00:31:20,153 --> 00:31:24,437
you know, by now this is the TRAPPIST-1 light curve.

512
00:31:24,437 --> 00:31:32,445
And yeah, this is, this is, this is, these are the seven exoplanets that were

513
00:31:32,445 --> 00:31:36,729
announced last week by University of

514
00:31:36,729 --> 00:31:41,033
Lice in collaboration with NASA and

515
00:31:41,033 --> 00:31:44,416
all sorts of cool, um, you know, yeah, scientific.

516
00:31:47,453 --> 00:31:48,213
universities and stuff.

517
00:31:48,213 --> 00:31:52,635
But what's actually nice is that the University of Geneva

518
00:31:52,635 --> 00:31:56,856
holds the prestigious last position in the Nature article

519
00:31:56,856 --> 00:31:57,936
that announced the find.

520
00:31:57,936 --> 00:32:03,538
So we're super happy that we're working with them.

521
00:32:03,538 --> 00:32:07,940
So why can't we use algorithms to find these exoplanets?

522
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,600
Well, we somewhat can use algorithms

523
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,161
to find these exoplanets.

524
00:32:11,161 --> 00:32:13,862
There is a box-fitting algorithm.

525
00:32:14,427 --> 00:32:20,409
used to search for periodic transits in the light curves.

526
00:32:20,409 --> 00:32:25,272
This method is called BLS or box-fitting least squares.

527
00:32:25,272 --> 00:32:26,392
I hope that's correct.

528
00:32:26,392 --> 00:32:31,895
It's more or less like a periodogram

529
00:32:31,895 --> 00:32:35,357
looking for periodic events in the light curve

530
00:32:35,357 --> 00:32:39,318
and computing the power as a function of the frequency.

531
00:32:40,109 --> 00:32:44,873
And then the algorithm folds the light curve to find,

532
00:32:44,873 --> 00:32:48,636
to the highest identified peak in the BLS.

533
00:32:48,636 --> 00:32:52,319
But, there are some issues with it.

534
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:55,702
It's great when you have like a single planet.

535
00:32:55,702 --> 00:32:58,304
This works great when you have a single planet,

536
00:32:58,304 --> 00:33:00,486
but this starts to break really badly

537
00:33:00,486 --> 00:33:03,949
when you have multi-planet systems like Trappist-1,

538
00:33:03,949 --> 00:33:05,010
and when you have...

539
00:33:06,164 --> 00:33:09,024
circumbindary planets that you see here, basically, systems

540
00:33:09,024 --> 00:33:16,325
with two suns, monotransit events, and transits that are

541
00:33:16,325 --> 00:33:21,046
masqueraded by strong stellar activity, so if you have a lot

542
00:33:21,046 --> 00:33:22,606
of activities around.

543
00:33:22,606 --> 00:33:26,007
So humans are actually outperforming the algorithm.

544
00:33:26,007 --> 00:33:30,088
So there is still some hope for humans, which is great.

545
00:33:35,078 --> 00:33:37,540
And there are also a lot of interesting challenges here

546
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:41,102
that we're working through with the students

547
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,503
from Reykjavik University.

548
00:33:42,503 --> 00:33:46,245
They're both really interesting technical issues

549
00:33:46,245 --> 00:33:50,108
with how in the world do you render

550
00:33:50,108 --> 00:33:52,809
ridiculous amount of data points in a graph in E1 line?

551
00:33:52,809 --> 00:33:57,993
How do you fold these light graphs

552
00:33:57,993 --> 00:33:59,413
and how do you actually mark them?

553
00:33:59,413 --> 00:34:03,116
And then how do you mark multiple transits?

554
00:34:04,036 --> 00:34:08,798
But there's also a lot of really interesting game design

555
00:34:08,798 --> 00:34:10,699
questions.

556
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:13,861
And since we only want to host one project at a time,

557
00:34:13,861 --> 00:34:18,664
one really interesting challenge is how do you sunset the Human

558
00:34:18,664 --> 00:34:21,625
Protein Atlas project, and how do you do it gracefully,

559
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:25,687
and how do you store the data and store the prestige

560
00:34:25,687 --> 00:34:30,230
that people have managed to create for themselves?

561
00:34:31,613 --> 00:34:34,654
Another interesting challenge is that exoplanets are really,

562
00:34:34,654 --> 00:34:38,736
really, really, really, really rare.

563
00:34:38,736 --> 00:34:41,978
So how do you make an engaging experience searching

564
00:34:41,978 --> 00:34:43,798
for a needle in a haystack?

565
00:34:43,798 --> 00:34:48,961
So that's definitely a fun problem to solve.

566
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:53,243
And then we also want to create opportunities for mastery,

567
00:34:53,243 --> 00:34:55,304
and that's super important.

568
00:34:55,304 --> 00:35:00,346
So a couple of takeaways from this lecture.

569
00:35:01,434 --> 00:35:06,579
And this was actually a super fun project to work on.

570
00:35:06,579 --> 00:35:09,582
Even if it's considered a serious game,

571
00:35:09,582 --> 00:35:10,723
it's still entertaining.

572
00:35:10,723 --> 00:35:12,705
And it is entertainment.

573
00:35:12,705 --> 00:35:16,809
And I mean, I think the game is fun.

574
00:35:16,809 --> 00:35:20,172
But what's actually also really great

575
00:35:20,172 --> 00:35:23,856
is that we managed to connect people that usually don't talk.

576
00:35:24,284 --> 00:35:28,026
I've probably never googled as many words from emails in my life.

577
00:35:28,026 --> 00:35:32,308
I've learned a lot of words that I can never use, but again,

578
00:35:32,308 --> 00:35:35,950
but my Google searches are very interesting now.

579
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:44,635
I mean, we were kind of one of the reasons why this project, I think, worked really well with us,

580
00:35:44,635 --> 00:35:51,678
is that we have a really engaged community, and they're really engaged with this project.

581
00:35:53,683 --> 00:35:59,466
They actually made their own subreddit about ProDiscovery that kind of blew up.

582
00:35:59,466 --> 00:36:04,069
It was amazing and there was a lot of people like non-scientists that,

583
00:36:04,069 --> 00:36:07,491
non-EVE players that participate in this community.

584
00:36:07,491 --> 00:36:10,373
So that's really, really great.

585
00:36:10,373 --> 00:36:17,337
Like I said before, I mean, this was a huge leap of faith, you know,

586
00:36:17,337 --> 00:36:21,059
trusting a third party to provide content.

587
00:36:21,607 --> 00:36:23,868
for a game is a very, very, very scary thought.

588
00:36:23,868 --> 00:36:27,650
And it's something we talked a lot about in CCP.

589
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:30,411
If it's like, this is like one of the big blockers

590
00:36:30,411 --> 00:36:31,672
for the project in the beginning.

591
00:36:31,672 --> 00:36:33,853
It's like, how can you make sure that like,

592
00:36:33,853 --> 00:36:38,195
how can you make sure that we can press this person?

593
00:36:38,195 --> 00:36:43,137
And, but it, you know, it was unnecessary scare.

594
00:36:43,137 --> 00:36:47,700
I mean, the project has, you know, not, yeah, it's been up.

595
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:50,641
Yeah, it's very little downtime.

596
00:36:51,267 --> 00:36:54,649
And it's really good content.

597
00:36:54,649 --> 00:37:01,092
And we managed to kind of emerge the content fairly

598
00:37:01,092 --> 00:37:05,314
seamlessly with the game and the whole game experience.

599
00:37:05,314 --> 00:37:10,776
And kind of apart from this being fun, we found that there

600
00:37:10,776 --> 00:37:14,898
are two main reasons why that kind of drove people back to

601
00:37:14,898 --> 00:37:15,518
Pro Discovery.

602
00:37:15,518 --> 00:37:19,340
The first one was that there was a big group of people that

603
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,601
looked at Pro Discovery as a

604
00:37:22,067 --> 00:37:26,029
almost as mining, so there was exclusive rewards that you

605
00:37:26,029 --> 00:37:28,430
couldn't get anywhere else, and you could sell it

606
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:29,070
for a good profit.

607
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:35,472
And then there was also a very big group of players that are

608
00:37:35,472 --> 00:37:38,153
just doing it for the science, and are doing it for the

609
00:37:38,153 --> 00:37:38,873
greater good.

610
00:37:38,873 --> 00:37:42,695
And it's actually amazing the amount of people that have

611
00:37:42,695 --> 00:37:45,296
ridiculous amount of analysis credits and are not spending

612
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:49,577
it, because the reward is doing science.

613
00:37:49,577 --> 00:37:51,098
And so that's really great.

614
00:37:51,848 --> 00:37:57,132
And also, Huw and Proton Atlas did a fantastic job

615
00:37:57,132 --> 00:37:58,173
embracing the community.

616
00:37:58,173 --> 00:38:01,595
Everything from communicating with people on Twitter quite

617
00:38:01,595 --> 00:38:06,478
actively, to opening up their wall to send along people into

618
00:38:06,478 --> 00:38:11,141
the wikis, and giving university lectures in the

619
00:38:11,141 --> 00:38:14,223
in-game university, Eve University.

620
00:38:14,223 --> 00:38:17,925
So we definitely want to, this is one of the things that

621
00:38:17,925 --> 00:38:19,066
drove us and Attila to.

622
00:38:19,887 --> 00:38:25,111
investigate MOOCs and allow players to dive as deeply as

623
00:38:25,111 --> 00:38:29,934
they want into the subject at hand.

624
00:38:29,934 --> 00:38:36,618
Yeah, and also, like what I said before, what MMOS is

625
00:38:36,618 --> 00:38:39,040
providing is not limited to cell images or exoplanets.

626
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:43,541
It's really easy to kind of imagine how this could fit into other games.

627
00:38:43,541 --> 00:38:45,601
I mean, here is something that's super straightforward.

628
00:38:45,601 --> 00:38:47,782
I mean, these are not actual projects.

629
00:38:47,782 --> 00:38:53,024
This is just like sketches, like bad Photoshop, producer Photoshop, like I call it.

630
00:38:53,024 --> 00:39:01,346
I mean, here you can see like, you know, us, Zoo, Zoo Universe kind of analyzing

631
00:39:01,346 --> 00:39:04,427
images, animal images from webcams.

632
00:39:06,528 --> 00:39:10,229
like automated images or, you know, even cooler, like,

633
00:39:10,229 --> 00:39:17,372
if you could, you know, use your pip in Fallout 4 to cure cancer.

634
00:39:17,372 --> 00:39:19,733
I don't know. That would be awesome.

635
00:39:19,733 --> 00:39:22,034
Anyone from Bethesda? Bling, bling.

636
00:39:22,034 --> 00:39:28,176
But all in all, I mean, now we have the infrastructure in place

637
00:39:28,176 --> 00:39:33,498
and we can really start to kind of weave the core storyline

638
00:39:33,498 --> 00:39:34,899
of the game with Pro Discovery.

639
00:39:35,697 --> 00:39:44,645
giving us more tools to deepen the experience and blur the lines between the reality of EVE Online and the reality that we live in.

640
00:39:44,645 --> 00:39:48,248
And by doing this we hope to set an example,

641
00:39:48,248 --> 00:39:54,893
we hope that our example sets the stage for many more successful collaborations between science and gaming to come.

642
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:59,437
So yeah, Citizen Science begins with you.

643
00:39:59,437 --> 00:39:59,897
Any questions?

644
00:40:12,302 --> 00:40:13,363
I have a question actually, yeah.

645
00:40:13,363 --> 00:40:14,364
Yep, there's a mic in the center.

646
00:40:14,364 --> 00:40:14,864
Sure.

647
00:40:14,864 --> 00:40:17,766
It's been a little while since I played Eve,

648
00:40:17,766 --> 00:40:21,649
but you guys do have a lot of sort of,

649
00:40:21,649 --> 00:40:23,851
for the Bartles type players that don't want to do combat,

650
00:40:23,851 --> 00:40:25,472
but want to do exploration and research,

651
00:40:25,472 --> 00:40:27,033
there's a lot of options for that in the game.

652
00:40:27,033 --> 00:40:29,075
There's like the probe ships that you can get

653
00:40:29,075 --> 00:40:32,117
that are sort of more specialized towards exploration.

654
00:40:32,117 --> 00:40:34,899
How much did Project Discovery bleed

655
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:36,981
into that sort of exploration play type?

656
00:40:36,981 --> 00:40:39,062
Like were there ships that were better at pulling in data

657
00:40:39,062 --> 00:40:41,224
that were like research ships or anything like that?

658
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:48,972
So we wanted the project to be something for everyone.

659
00:40:48,972 --> 00:40:52,113
And we wanted the barrier of entry to be as low as we could,

660
00:40:52,113 --> 00:40:55,734
because analyzing proteins is actually

661
00:40:55,734 --> 00:40:58,874
a fairly difficult task.

662
00:40:58,874 --> 00:41:00,915
So for this initial project, we did not

663
00:41:00,915 --> 00:41:04,176
tie it into any of the core systems.

664
00:41:04,176 --> 00:41:08,377
But this actually served us as great PVE.

665
00:41:09,075 --> 00:41:12,517
And it's actually great exploration content in an odd way.

666
00:41:12,517 --> 00:41:14,759
It's a really cool project.

667
00:41:14,759 --> 00:41:19,702
I just want to congratulate you guys on the success so far.

668
00:41:19,702 --> 00:41:22,484
I think I heard you said something,

669
00:41:22,484 --> 00:41:24,165
you had like 250,000 protein samples.

670
00:41:24,165 --> 00:41:27,847
I was just wondering if you could elaborate

671
00:41:27,847 --> 00:41:29,769
where those came from and how they were collected.

672
00:41:31,477 --> 00:41:37,061
They were coming from the Human Protein Atlas.

673
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:41,264
And it's a 10, 15 year research project.

674
00:41:41,264 --> 00:41:44,006
And they're building an open database

675
00:41:44,006 --> 00:41:46,488
of microscopic images.

676
00:41:46,488 --> 00:41:48,209
So it was them who acquired these images.

677
00:41:48,209 --> 00:41:50,651
They have a state of the art technology.

678
00:41:50,651 --> 00:41:54,173
They're acquiring, I don't know how many images per week.

679
00:41:54,173 --> 00:41:56,655
But it's growing, growing continuously.

680
00:42:01,278 --> 00:42:06,880
I think it's super cool that your players actually were the ones that created that subreddit

681
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:12,843
And I'm super hoping that they're that the scientists on the team did an AMA that we all can read

682
00:42:12,843 --> 00:42:17,125
But my question is how did you initially communicate the the real-world?

683
00:42:17,125 --> 00:42:19,946
quality of this this

684
00:42:19,946 --> 00:42:25,329
Project or minigame to your players like they clearly know what's going on and why it's important, and what did you how'd you tell them?

685
00:42:25,329 --> 00:42:25,489
and

686
00:42:28,741 --> 00:42:29,421
That's a good question.

687
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:32,543
We had no idea how to communicate it.

688
00:42:32,543 --> 00:42:36,144
We're really good at communicating

689
00:42:36,144 --> 00:42:42,267
in-game, in-lore type of communication,

690
00:42:42,267 --> 00:42:48,430
but this tie-in between real science and in-game content.

691
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:50,932
There was a lot of debate like, hey, how much should we?

692
00:42:51,548 --> 00:42:53,831
downplay or upplay the real science part,

693
00:42:53,831 --> 00:42:57,173
because in a way, you don't want to break the immersion

694
00:42:57,173 --> 00:43:00,717
of you're playing Eve, and when you're playing

695
00:43:00,717 --> 00:43:04,600
Pro Discovery in Eve, you're actually doing science

696
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,961
for the science faction.

697
00:43:05,961 --> 00:43:08,463
So there was a very delicate balance,

698
00:43:08,463 --> 00:43:12,367
but then it just spun out, and people kind of started

699
00:43:12,367 --> 00:43:13,388
writing whatever they wanted.

700
00:43:13,388 --> 00:43:15,630
I mean, you guys have such a good community

701
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:17,351
that I figured you did something on the forums

702
00:43:17,351 --> 00:43:18,392
or something like that first.

703
00:43:18,392 --> 00:43:19,053
You didn't do that?

704
00:43:19,277 --> 00:43:32,406
No, we did like, I mean, we had like a webpage and we have forums and video blogs and on our own kind of in-game news network and yeah, so multiple channels. Awesome.

705
00:43:32,406 --> 00:43:47,775
Hey guys, amazing talk and project and I was wondering if you can shed some light about how will you turn the Exoplanet stuff into a gameplay experience?

706
00:43:49,589 --> 00:43:56,854
Yeah, so I mean we are kind of in the initial steps in making it, but there is a really...

707
00:43:56,854 --> 00:44:03,999
So you're basically looking for these transits, and when you're looking for these transits,

708
00:44:03,999 --> 00:44:05,800
they should happen in a certain rhythm.

709
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:14,085
So what you're looking for, you're both looking for the dips, and then you're also looking for the rhythms of those dips.

710
00:44:14,991 --> 00:44:17,954
So there is some really cool tools that you have to use

711
00:44:17,954 --> 00:44:22,579
where you're kind of overlapping the light curves

712
00:44:22,579 --> 00:44:25,803
on top of itself, and then aligning,

713
00:44:25,803 --> 00:44:29,426
kind of using the power of the dip,

714
00:44:29,426 --> 00:44:32,169
you try to align the transits.

715
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:37,135
There's actually a second state that will kind of look like.

716
00:44:37,818 --> 00:44:39,498
the curves kind of, you know, they have,

717
00:44:39,498 --> 00:44:41,739
usually have somewhat of a sine wave.

718
00:44:41,739 --> 00:44:44,520
So, you know, you need to also normalize that.

719
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:48,582
So there is a, you know, multiple kind of tools that you use.

720
00:44:48,582 --> 00:44:50,683
But it's, I mean, it's one of the things

721
00:44:50,683 --> 00:44:52,883
that we are debating a lot right now.

722
00:44:52,883 --> 00:44:56,005
And what extra things we'll add into it.

723
00:44:56,005 --> 00:44:59,186
But yeah, you are looking for a needle in a haystack.

724
00:44:59,186 --> 00:45:02,527
So there is a lot of data that has nothing in it.

725
00:45:02,527 --> 00:45:06,208
So there is, yeah, there is an interesting mastery element.

726
00:45:07,146 --> 00:45:08,794
Okay, okay. Thank you.

727
00:45:12,226 --> 00:45:16,827
Hey. When you pick the game, you mentioned that you want a

728
00:45:16,827 --> 00:45:21,848
consistent play time. So it doesn't sometimes finish too

729
00:45:21,848 --> 00:45:25,969
fast or too slow. Is that because of the gameplay or more

730
00:45:25,969 --> 00:45:29,309
for rewarding? Because for City at Home you mentioned, right,

731
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:32,870
they had no problem dealing with different kind of CPUs because

732
00:45:32,870 --> 00:45:36,851
we can always weigh all the outcomes and reward fairly.

733
00:45:37,571 --> 00:45:43,857
And even if the rewards are not different, I mean, people are apparently buying crates, trying to open them in CSGO.

734
00:45:43,857 --> 00:45:48,581
So I suppose even random chance of different rewards may not be a problem.

735
00:45:48,581 --> 00:45:52,184
So is that more from gameplay's perspective to make it more interesting?

736
00:45:52,184 --> 00:45:56,748
Yeah, it was definitely from a gameplay perspective.

737
00:45:56,748 --> 00:46:02,133
You know, we want to, when you open up this thing, we kind of want you to have the feeling that...

738
00:46:03,138 --> 00:46:05,058
you know what you're getting yourself into.

739
00:46:05,058 --> 00:46:05,779
Like, you don't want to,

740
00:46:05,779 --> 00:46:08,499
we don't want to create a feeling of you, like,

741
00:46:08,499 --> 00:46:10,660
not knowing if, you know, you will do like two

742
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:12,460
and that will be like five minutes,

743
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:16,642
or if you do two and you will do like, you know, 30 minutes.

744
00:46:16,642 --> 00:46:23,684
So we just, the consistent time was more to,

745
00:46:23,684 --> 00:46:26,784
yeah, just kind of create familiarity

746
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:28,365
and not scare people away.

747
00:46:28,365 --> 00:46:28,685
Okay.

748
00:46:28,685 --> 00:46:29,505
Thank you.

749
00:46:33,308 --> 00:46:40,092
Hi there. My name is Brandon. I'm a grad student at the University of Utah. I make games that

750
00:46:40,092 --> 00:46:46,635
heal people. So hearing this talk from you two is really inspiring. Yeah, what you're doing is

751
00:46:46,635 --> 00:46:47,796
making a huge impact.

752
00:46:49,077 --> 00:46:51,878
really, really exciting to see.

753
00:46:51,878 --> 00:46:53,858
So one of the things that kind of stood out to me

754
00:46:53,858 --> 00:46:55,899
is really important for making this work

755
00:46:55,899 --> 00:47:00,861
is the partnership between the university and CCP.

756
00:47:00,861 --> 00:47:05,102
So I was wondering if you could maybe elaborate

757
00:47:05,102 --> 00:47:08,884
a bit more on that, like what value did

758
00:47:08,884 --> 00:47:11,365
the university see in collaborating with CCP

759
00:47:11,365 --> 00:47:13,065
and vice versa too?

760
00:47:13,065 --> 00:47:15,886
I'd love if you guys could elaborate on that a bit.

761
00:47:15,886 --> 00:47:16,687
Sorry, what was the last thing?

762
00:47:17,434 --> 00:47:21,296
Just elaborating on the partnership between the two,

763
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:23,197
and what value you each saw in each other.

764
00:47:23,197 --> 00:47:23,337
Yeah.

765
00:47:23,337 --> 00:47:31,221
I mean, it's working with universities.

766
00:47:31,221 --> 00:47:34,522
I mean, the good thing about working with universities

767
00:47:34,522 --> 00:47:38,905
is you get just a much more academic approach to the issue,

768
00:47:38,905 --> 00:47:41,226
rather than us game developers,

769
00:47:41,226 --> 00:47:43,887
and we've been groomed in thinking in productions

770
00:47:43,887 --> 00:47:46,688
and production cycles, and like, oh, this won't work.

771
00:47:46,688 --> 00:47:46,848
But.

772
00:47:47,476 --> 00:47:51,899
So kind of research is sometimes organized to the bottom

773
00:47:51,899 --> 00:47:53,481
when you're in production, sadly.

774
00:47:53,481 --> 00:47:57,444
So we've learned a lot from working with the university

775
00:47:57,444 --> 00:48:00,586
and just kind of their approaches to the issue

776
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:04,910
and how they kind of deal with and dissect the issues

777
00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:07,892
at hand.

778
00:48:07,892 --> 00:48:10,835
Kind of a bonus from that is that we've actually found

779
00:48:10,835 --> 00:48:12,256
awesome developers.

780
00:48:12,767 --> 00:48:14,729
through these projects that are now working with us.

781
00:48:14,729 --> 00:48:17,672
So that's also just kind of helping,

782
00:48:17,672 --> 00:48:21,235
I mean that's helping the tiny island of Iceland a lot

783
00:48:21,235 --> 00:48:24,218
because we have, it's sometimes tricky

784
00:48:24,218 --> 00:48:26,160
to lure people to move to Iceland to work.

785
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,541
Wonder why.

786
00:48:27,541 --> 00:48:31,084
So, no, it's been really good and there's a very,

787
00:48:31,084 --> 00:48:34,808
we have a very healthy relationship

788
00:48:34,808 --> 00:48:36,590
with universities in Iceland.

789
00:48:37,925 --> 00:48:41,468
Yeah, and I don't know if you care to share, Attila,

790
00:48:41,468 --> 00:48:44,270
any about that relationship, too.

791
00:48:44,270 --> 00:48:49,455
Well, I think one thing which was really interesting,

792
00:48:49,455 --> 00:48:53,178
and probably Berger should talk about that,

793
00:48:53,178 --> 00:48:55,280
we had a presentation with Andy,

794
00:48:56,429 --> 00:49:03,393
One big obstacle in the very early stage of the project is how to justify it.

795
00:49:03,393 --> 00:49:07,234
Both inside CSC and both for the gamer community.

796
00:49:07,234 --> 00:49:14,898
This is something that needs a bit of focus, so it means that other things will lose a bit of focus,

797
00:49:14,898 --> 00:49:19,200
and players always have things that they want to improve.

798
00:49:20,365 --> 00:49:22,247
And so she had to justify all this.

799
00:49:22,247 --> 00:49:24,909
And this was a very lucky setup that we

800
00:49:24,909 --> 00:49:27,252
can say that a lot of the work was

801
00:49:27,252 --> 00:49:33,197
done by external students or interns in the company.

802
00:49:33,197 --> 00:49:40,263
So we could communicate that there is not

803
00:49:40,263 --> 00:49:41,765
huge loss of focus in CCP.

804
00:49:41,765 --> 00:49:44,667
So I think that was a really interesting approach.

805
00:49:44,667 --> 00:49:45,208
OK, thank you.

806
00:49:48,206 --> 00:49:50,728
Hi, thanks for the talk first of all.

807
00:49:50,728 --> 00:49:53,910
And I just want to ask, I think it's great what you're doing

808
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:59,213
because while the human brain is great at pattern recognition,

809
00:49:59,213 --> 00:50:01,995
even to the point where humans can recognize patterns

810
00:50:01,995 --> 00:50:04,877
where there are none, did you take any steps

811
00:50:04,877 --> 00:50:09,059
to avoid fake data from people seeing patterns

812
00:50:09,059 --> 00:50:10,600
where there are none?

813
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:11,741
Yes, we did.

814
00:50:11,741 --> 00:50:16,664
So one of the issues with crowdsourcing and crowdsourcing

815
00:50:16,664 --> 00:50:17,525
science is...

816
00:50:17,929 --> 00:50:22,613
are like trends, and you know, if things go viral.

817
00:50:22,613 --> 00:50:25,935
And we had the thing go viral very early on in the project

818
00:50:25,935 --> 00:50:28,217
where people like started to, I mean,

819
00:50:28,217 --> 00:50:31,039
they started to spam one of the protein categories

820
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:31,760
called the cytoplasm.

821
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,682
And we had to react really quickly,

822
00:50:34,682 --> 00:50:37,524
and luckily it was, you know, really early on

823
00:50:37,524 --> 00:50:40,166
and we managed to kind of deal with it right away.

824
00:50:40,166 --> 00:50:41,848
So we had to, we kind of changed

825
00:50:41,848 --> 00:50:43,729
our reward structure a little bit.

826
00:50:45,121 --> 00:50:53,328
But this is always one of the top things you have to worry about in any crowd sourcing thing.

827
00:50:53,328 --> 00:50:59,392
It's like if everyone decides to press A, then A must be the right answer.

828
00:50:59,392 --> 00:51:03,716
That's kind of the issue. It's one of the downsides of crowd sourcing.

829
00:51:03,716 --> 00:51:07,318
But I don't know. I think we're getting really good data.

830
00:51:07,318 --> 00:51:13,483
The accuracy is relatively good when you compare it to crowd sourcing.

831
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:17,882
gold standard and analysis done by scientists.

832
00:51:17,882 --> 00:51:18,022
So.

833
00:51:18,022 --> 00:51:22,504
So just to add a little bit more on that,

834
00:51:22,504 --> 00:51:26,645
in the beginning we used two ways

835
00:51:26,645 --> 00:51:28,206
to benchmark players' performance.

836
00:51:28,206 --> 00:51:29,646
One was gold standard.

837
00:51:29,646 --> 00:51:32,968
That was pretty straightforward.

838
00:51:32,968 --> 00:51:35,769
And the other way was when we reached consensus

839
00:51:35,769 --> 00:51:37,910
on a certain image, then we retroactively

840
00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:40,331
adjusted the scores of players.

841
00:51:41,244 --> 00:51:44,688
And that was a small point where players

842
00:51:44,688 --> 00:51:47,831
could actually exploit the system if they wanted to.

843
00:51:47,831 --> 00:51:50,854
Plus, cytoplasm is a location in the cell

844
00:51:50,854 --> 00:51:54,098
which appears more often,

845
00:51:54,098 --> 00:51:57,141
and it's kind of a judgment call in many cases,

846
00:51:57,141 --> 00:51:59,684
whether you mark it as a class or it's there,

847
00:51:59,684 --> 00:52:02,086
but it's not really a signal.

848
00:52:03,588 --> 00:52:07,573
Putting all this together, we had this thing which we called

849
00:52:07,573 --> 00:52:13,340
later Cytoplasm Scam, and then we quickly, quickly really just

850
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:15,063
removed that kind of

851
00:52:17,797 --> 00:52:24,161
thing in the system where we retroactively adjusted the scores and we now just use gold

852
00:52:24,161 --> 00:52:30,305
standard. Which is actually, it's interesting because in many classical citizen science

853
00:52:30,305 --> 00:52:36,789
projects they actually use this approach to benchmark users' performance. But you know,

854
00:52:36,789 --> 00:52:38,691
games are a bit different.

855
00:52:38,691 --> 00:52:41,713
Yeah, great. Thanks and keep up the good work.

856
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:48,162
you might have just answered this question partially with

857
00:52:48,162 --> 00:52:52,926
that response. But with project discovery, you talked about your

858
00:52:52,926 --> 00:52:56,829
accuracy being measured against all the other submissions from

859
00:52:56,829 --> 00:53:00,632
crowdsourcing. You guys blew up pretty quickly within the first

860
00:53:00,632 --> 00:53:03,414
24 hours, so maybe this wasn't at the end of the day a problem.

861
00:53:03,414 --> 00:53:06,537
But did you have any concerns or considerations within the first

862
00:53:06,537 --> 00:53:12,862
few hours or the first few days on not having the database to

863
00:53:12,862 --> 00:53:14,343
base your samples against?

864
00:53:16,612 --> 00:53:19,716
Actually, the first few days, the only consideration

865
00:53:19,716 --> 00:53:21,979
was to keep the system running.

866
00:53:21,979 --> 00:53:26,465
We didn't have time to analyze the data quality.

867
00:53:26,465 --> 00:53:28,167
But I think already at that point,

868
00:53:28,167 --> 00:53:31,851
we knew that it's going to be very successful

869
00:53:31,851 --> 00:53:34,254
from the perspective of activity.

870
00:53:35,155 --> 00:53:38,616
so it gives us more space to maneuver.

871
00:53:38,616 --> 00:53:44,738
So that's why we focused on first to find the glitches

872
00:53:44,738 --> 00:53:47,999
in the system and the bottlenecks,

873
00:53:47,999 --> 00:53:49,880
and then it took like two weeks,

874
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:52,480
and then after that we could focus on the quality.

875
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:57,082
But this Cytoplasm scan was so obvious

876
00:53:57,082 --> 00:53:59,862
and so everywhere in the forums, as far as I remember,

877
00:53:59,862 --> 00:54:03,103
so actually that we corrected in the first week.

878
00:54:04,034 --> 00:54:09,096
But I mean this is also where the consensus of the consensus was quite interesting

879
00:54:09,096 --> 00:54:14,437
So we could see after after the first three weeks when we reached consensus when we got the second consensus

880
00:54:14,437 --> 00:54:21,639
We could basically look at the two data sets together and see hey, you know how much offset was in the initial spike

881
00:54:21,639 --> 00:54:25,440
And you know how much?

882
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:30,101
Badness or goodness, you know was the initial spike, but they were relatively consistent

883
00:54:30,863 --> 00:54:33,384
at least the first three consensus.

884
00:54:33,384 --> 00:54:39,428
Yeah, it's really interesting because in classical citizen science platforms, they try to optimize

885
00:54:39,428 --> 00:54:45,572
more or less the usage of citizen science resources.

886
00:54:45,572 --> 00:54:50,755
So they try to use algorithms so that you can reach a consensus for a relatively low

887
00:54:50,755 --> 00:54:53,216
number of votes.

888
00:54:53,216 --> 00:55:00,060
Whereas here now we are improving a platform that we can kind of automatically...

889
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:04,024
put on the queue the same task that has been solved because

890
00:55:04,024 --> 00:55:08,247
it's an interesting thing. Of course we try to optimize the

891
00:55:08,247 --> 00:55:11,510
solution of one certain task

892
00:55:11,510 --> 00:55:12,531
but then

893
00:55:13,083 --> 00:55:15,924
you know, it's not possible to change, like,

894
00:55:15,924 --> 00:55:18,645
research project in a game from one day to the other.

895
00:55:18,645 --> 00:55:20,946
Whereas on the classical platforms,

896
00:55:20,946 --> 00:55:25,267
you just close the project and you choose another.

897
00:55:25,267 --> 00:55:26,907
Here, we have to keep it running.

898
00:55:26,907 --> 00:55:29,888
So here, even if they solved it in three weeks,

899
00:55:29,888 --> 00:55:32,429
we have to keep it running for half a year.

900
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:35,370
So that's also an interesting specialty of this approach.

901
00:55:35,370 --> 00:55:35,530
Yeah.

902
00:55:35,530 --> 00:55:35,890
Thank you, guys.

903
00:55:35,890 --> 00:55:36,190
Thank you.

904
00:55:36,190 --> 00:55:37,990
All right.

905
00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:39,091
Well, thank you very much.

906
00:55:39,091 --> 00:55:39,931
Thanks for coming.
