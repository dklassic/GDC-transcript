00:00:08,013 --> 00:00:09,234
Good afternoon, everyone.

2
00:00:09,294 --> 00:00:10,814
Welcome to GDC Showcase.

3
00:00:11,034 --> 00:00:12,995
I'm Brian Francis, a contributing editor

4
00:00:13,035 --> 00:00:16,516
at gamasutra.com and maker of things here at GDC.

5
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:19,237
I'm joined today by a very special guest for today's

6
00:00:19,317 --> 00:00:20,297
Ask Me Anything session.

7
00:00:20,698 --> 00:00:23,258
Please give a warm welcome to Sucker Punch co-founder,

8
00:00:23,378 --> 00:00:24,139
Brian Fleming.

9
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,059
Brian, would you please introduce yourself?

10
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,120
Well, thanks, Brian.

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,661
First, just got to say I'm super glad for the opportunity

12
00:00:32,681 --> 00:00:33,762
to talk to people today.

13
00:00:33,882 --> 00:00:36,983
So as you said, I'm one of the founders here at Sucker Punch.

14
00:00:38,062 --> 00:00:40,445
So I've been here since the very, very beginning,

15
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:43,047
all the way on the N64 days.

16
00:00:43,167 --> 00:00:44,869
And most recently, of course,

17
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:47,172
we finished a huge project,

18
00:00:47,212 --> 00:00:48,893
Ghost of Tsushima, and launched it last year.

19
00:00:50,328 --> 00:00:53,330
Awesome. And just to be clear, he's Brian, I'm Bryant.

20
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:54,731
I've got the T at the end of my name.

21
00:00:55,131 --> 00:00:58,153
Now, to get things rolling, we are here obviously

22
00:00:58,233 --> 00:01:00,455
because you, yes, you in the chat

23
00:01:00,575 --> 00:01:02,396
want to ask your questions for Brian

24
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:06,038
about Sucker Punch's excellent 2020 game, Ghost of Tsushima.

25
00:01:06,558 --> 00:01:07,379
I really love this game.

26
00:01:07,499 --> 00:01:09,400
I am super excited to be moderating this chat.

27
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,901
I can't stress enough that I put hours and hours

28
00:01:11,961 --> 00:01:12,582
and hours into it.

29
00:01:12,862 --> 00:01:14,703
So normally I would love to ask these questions

30
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,104
but I'm giving up that time

31
00:01:16,424 --> 00:01:18,065
so that you all can do the asking.

32
00:01:18,686 --> 00:01:24,188
You can ask questions about Ghost, or if you want to know more about Brian's experience in the game industry, that's also on the table.

33
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:31,632
Just kind of a reminder that obviously as a Game Developers Conference, we are asking questions that are relevant to game development.

34
00:01:31,712 --> 00:01:33,954
But hey, we find a way to make everything work here.

35
00:01:34,814 --> 00:01:38,496
With that in mind, I'm going to go over to the chat and start pulling some questions for us.

36
00:01:38,516 --> 00:01:39,917
We've got some ones coming in already.

37
00:01:41,432 --> 00:01:46,757
All right, let's get started here. Thomas Bellotti would like to know what is your favorite feature

38
00:01:46,877 --> 00:01:51,301
activity or activity that didn't make it into Ghost of Tsushima, if there were any, and what

39
00:01:51,321 --> 00:01:56,926
would be the reason they were cut? Well, you know, there's probably lots and some of those,

40
00:01:57,086 --> 00:02:02,771
our favorites are probably, you know, things we keep in the hopper for future games. You know,

41
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:09,777
I think that some of the really terrifically bad ideas often

42
00:02:10,822 --> 00:02:14,745
end up being really good ideas in the long run, you know, we had a whole bunch of ideas

43
00:02:14,785 --> 00:02:17,266
about how to do wayfinding in the world.

44
00:02:17,406 --> 00:02:22,109
And a lot of those bad ideas then were replaced when you add in something like the guiding

45
00:02:22,169 --> 00:02:27,732
wind and you really feel that sense of progress when you're making the game, you know, on,

46
00:02:28,113 --> 00:02:33,196
you know, that was a few years before we ship, but it's those moments where you have something

47
00:02:33,216 --> 00:02:36,117
that's not working and you transition to something that's really working.

48
00:02:36,558 --> 00:02:38,739
That for me on the system side is some of the most.

49
00:02:39,972 --> 00:02:42,993
entertaining and enjoyable stuff that we do.

50
00:02:43,473 --> 00:02:44,954
I guess the other stuff you end up cutting

51
00:02:45,414 --> 00:02:47,255
most often is just for scope.

52
00:02:47,355 --> 00:02:49,796
You know, you have one too many mini games

53
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:51,917
or one too many interactions

54
00:02:51,977 --> 00:02:53,598
and maybe some of those mini games will show up

55
00:02:54,678 --> 00:02:56,019
in some future work, so.

56
00:02:57,139 --> 00:02:57,880
That's a good answer.

57
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,360
I especially like pointing out that, you know,

58
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,481
like the guiding wind, you know,

59
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:01,921
didn't just emerge from thin air.

60
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:03,482
It came from iteration.

61
00:03:04,135 --> 00:03:05,936
Although when should a merchant mayor?

62
00:03:05,996 --> 00:03:06,336
I don't know.

63
00:03:07,036 --> 00:03:09,176
Let's go to Brandon Ledbetter's question.

64
00:03:09,476 --> 00:03:11,077
When working on a game of this scale,

65
00:03:11,417 --> 00:03:13,157
how do you manage ideas and features

66
00:03:13,237 --> 00:03:14,658
and when do you decide to start cutting?

67
00:03:14,718 --> 00:03:16,418
That actually plays off the last one really well.

68
00:03:16,538 --> 00:03:16,778
Right.

69
00:03:17,578 --> 00:03:21,179
Yeah, you know, we talk about scope is everything.

70
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:23,059
Sucker Punch is not a particularly large team.

71
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:24,960
We're not small, you know, at our peak,

72
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:28,240
we were probably 150 people and that includes our QA staff

73
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:33,041
and, you know, all the things you need to run a business.

74
00:03:34,834 --> 00:03:36,015
And so not a huge team.

75
00:03:36,135 --> 00:03:39,377
And so scope from the very beginning was the entire,

76
00:03:39,397 --> 00:03:41,739
you know, it was a conversation throughout.

77
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,722
And so strangely, I feel like we feel like

78
00:03:44,742 --> 00:03:46,623
we were cutting constantly.

79
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:50,226
And I think that's part of the healthy process

80
00:03:50,307 --> 00:03:52,168
is that the things that you decide to cut

81
00:03:53,469 --> 00:03:54,830
kind of give room for the things

82
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:56,552
that are actually really good about the game

83
00:03:56,592 --> 00:03:58,453
to have space and to grow.

84
00:03:59,374 --> 00:04:02,156
And so I would say really from year one,

85
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:05,732
all the way through to three months before the game ship,

86
00:04:06,172 --> 00:04:06,772
we were cutting.

87
00:04:06,812 --> 00:04:08,213
It might've been smaller things, you know,

88
00:04:08,233 --> 00:04:10,615
you might be cutting a scene that isn't working

89
00:04:10,695 --> 00:04:13,337
or an individual lines of dialogue to sharpen things up.

90
00:04:13,677 --> 00:04:17,599
But the scalpel is one of the most important tools

91
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,200
that we wield.

92
00:04:19,981 --> 00:04:21,482
And certainly we, you know,

93
00:04:21,502 --> 00:04:24,083
we did throughout the process of making Ghost.

94
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:27,460
We're going to switch paths here.

95
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,743
The question that folks in chat seem most excited about,

96
00:04:31,043 --> 00:04:32,944
we've got this great thumbs up system you guys can use

97
00:04:32,964 --> 00:04:35,687
to just thumbs up the questions you want to hear answered.

98
00:04:36,768 --> 00:04:39,029
From Rafael Smears-Morais,

99
00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:41,611
Japanese players largely praise Ghost of Tsushima

100
00:04:41,651 --> 00:04:42,592
for being one of the games

101
00:04:42,612 --> 00:04:45,054
to most accurately represent Japanese culture to date.

102
00:04:45,795 --> 00:04:47,916
Their question is, what were the procedures

103
00:04:47,956 --> 00:04:49,838
to ensure the game would execute

104
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:51,820
such a good representation of that culture?

105
00:04:53,393 --> 00:05:05,682
Well, you know, I think from the very beginning, the original pitch, it was part of our, we were aware of, of sort of the level of responsibility that we had to have in this area.

106
00:05:06,163 --> 00:05:14,970
So there's a story that that the fans may know, which is that we actually pitched this to Shu Yoshida.

107
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:19,093
He was one of the very first people we ever pitched it to because we wanted.

108
00:05:19,808 --> 00:05:25,510
not just his guidance and his assessment, but really his blessing that, hey, this this could

109
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:32,652
be done, that a team from the West could really do this. And and with his support, then we we began

110
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:40,514
engaging with, you know, a wider audience and that almost immediately included the team at Sony ISD,

111
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:47,936
the Japan team and and their participation in the game throughout from the original pitches to each

112
00:05:47,976 --> 00:05:49,336
of the videos that we would show.

113
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,703
they would reflect back to us the parts of the visuals

114
00:05:53,763 --> 00:05:56,285
and the parts of the story and the parts of the characters,

115
00:05:57,046 --> 00:05:58,267
the names of the characters,

116
00:05:58,467 --> 00:06:03,071
all the details that they found that both worked well

117
00:06:03,231 --> 00:06:04,573
and the things that were not working for them.

118
00:06:04,653 --> 00:06:09,497
And we were super appreciative of that feedback

119
00:06:09,557 --> 00:06:11,078
and responsive as a result.

120
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:14,962
And so that process was really a healthy part.

121
00:06:15,633 --> 00:06:17,514
of the ongoing development throughout.

122
00:06:18,215 --> 00:06:22,598
And certainly without their guidance, we would never have achieved

123
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:23,459
what we achieved.

124
00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:25,140
And there's even little stories.

125
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:29,023
And, you know, one of the details that I really love is that team

126
00:06:29,404 --> 00:06:32,446
was so committed to the project that they made sure

127
00:06:32,966 --> 00:06:37,470
that every single kanji in the game, that they understood

128
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,972
that that kanji actually existed in the 13th century.

129
00:06:40,973 --> 00:06:45,374
And so if they had, you know, there are often multiple different ways to describe something,

130
00:06:45,434 --> 00:06:51,236
and they went and found the exact kanji that would have been used back in that time to make

131
00:06:51,316 --> 00:06:55,918
sure that we were being authentic, even at that level. So tremendous effort in partnership with

132
00:06:55,958 --> 00:07:00,499
that team. Oh, that's such an excellent anecdote. It sounds like international cooperation,

133
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:04,621
you know, is one of those things that yeah, and you know, I mean, it's just one of the joys of

134
00:07:04,641 --> 00:07:05,381
the project was.

135
00:07:05,788 --> 00:07:07,909
being committed to being a learner,

136
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:10,750
not remotely pretending that we understood it,

137
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,572
to recognize that we needed to go learn

138
00:07:13,612 --> 00:07:15,933
and that you had to go find your selection of teachers

139
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:19,214
and mentors to really help us on that journey.

140
00:07:20,295 --> 00:07:22,276
Gotcha, we're going back to Thomas Belotti here

141
00:07:22,336 --> 00:07:24,417
who seems to be asking some really questions

142
00:07:24,437 --> 00:07:25,797
that are resonating with chat.

143
00:07:26,217 --> 00:07:28,118
What were the biggest hurdles transitioning

144
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:31,400
from the Infamous series to Ghost of Tsushima?

145
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,121
It's a great question.

146
00:07:35,112 --> 00:07:42,798
The I think the single biggest change for the studio was, you know, infamous was an open world

147
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:48,483
game, but a kind of a small open world and we were going to a large open world. And effectively,

148
00:07:48,543 --> 00:07:54,908
that change, you know, kind of across the board, destabilized every aspect of our game making

149
00:07:55,148 --> 00:08:00,973
tool set. We had, you know, all the ground in infamous would be hand modeled by

150
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:02,691
by a 3D artist.

151
00:08:03,311 --> 00:08:05,033
There's no way you're gonna 3D model

152
00:08:05,313 --> 00:08:08,275
the individual vertices of something as big as this.

153
00:08:08,295 --> 00:08:09,616
So you have to change that.

154
00:08:09,716 --> 00:08:11,037
You have to change the, you know,

155
00:08:11,097 --> 00:08:15,600
we went from, you know, like a hundred tiles to 1200 tiles.

156
00:08:16,061 --> 00:08:17,582
The tiles were four times bigger.

157
00:08:18,863 --> 00:08:19,984
Everything broke.

158
00:08:20,244 --> 00:08:24,347
And so the biggest challenge really was the journey

159
00:08:24,407 --> 00:08:25,168
to getting to the point

160
00:08:25,228 --> 00:08:27,590
where we had solid earth under us again.

161
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,071
Because for really.

162
00:08:30,896 --> 00:08:37,081
many, many months, you know, 18, 24 months, things were still really quite

163
00:08:37,181 --> 00:08:39,022
difficult to synthesize into a game.

164
00:08:39,363 --> 00:08:40,424
You could sit down and play.

165
00:08:40,444 --> 00:08:47,610
Um, because there was just so much that, that used to work that had, had, was not

166
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,571
able to deal with the scope of what we were doing.

167
00:08:49,631 --> 00:08:53,294
So first couple of years were, were actually quite difficult, uh,

168
00:08:53,495 --> 00:08:55,016
at getting the game to stand up.

169
00:08:55,096 --> 00:08:58,058
And then as we got farther into it, you sort of at least had.

170
00:08:59,051 --> 00:09:02,673
you weren't sinking into the swamp constantly

171
00:09:02,713 --> 00:09:05,474
and you could begin to iterate and make progress.

172
00:09:06,554 --> 00:09:09,335
Talking more about the nuts and bolts making

173
00:09:09,355 --> 00:09:11,316
of Ghost of Tsushima,

174
00:09:11,396 --> 00:09:14,017
Mohammed Al Salman, I hope I pronounced that right,

175
00:09:14,598 --> 00:09:15,618
feel free to correct me in the chat.

176
00:09:16,478 --> 00:09:19,340
What was the hardest feature to implement in the game

177
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,280
and why was it so hard?

178
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:23,141
Yeah, it's easy answer and the answer was combat.

179
00:09:24,594 --> 00:09:31,299
The combat system was something that, you know, the team that worked on that handful of programmers

180
00:09:31,379 --> 00:09:38,285
and designers and animators, you know, they worked on nonstop for six years. We worked, you know,

181
00:09:38,305 --> 00:09:45,350
and built multiple versions of it with multiple approaches. And, you know, you're really dealing,

182
00:09:46,271 --> 00:09:49,834
the term I use for it is kind of ring zero. I always think of a bullseye and

183
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:53,032
and the combat system, along with a few other systems,

184
00:09:53,052 --> 00:09:54,913
like the way that the hero moves through the world,

185
00:09:55,414 --> 00:09:57,115
they're kind of the center of everything.

186
00:09:57,956 --> 00:10:00,618
And they have to work in every situation,

187
00:10:00,658 --> 00:10:03,521
they have to work in every lighting condition,

188
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:04,882
they have to work in every terrain,

189
00:10:04,922 --> 00:10:08,505
they have to work in every strange mode

190
00:10:08,545 --> 00:10:09,646
that the game might be in,

191
00:10:09,766 --> 00:10:11,467
combat could potentially break out in.

192
00:10:11,928 --> 00:10:12,828
And so as a result,

193
00:10:13,109 --> 00:10:17,032
they are just exceedingly constrained, right?

194
00:10:17,052 --> 00:10:17,432
You have to...

195
00:10:18,424 --> 00:10:21,765
it's not an isolated part of the problem where you can just say, Oh, well, in this case,

196
00:10:21,785 --> 00:10:26,867
we'll just ignore button inputs. Nope, can't do that. Oh, you know, in this case, we'll

197
00:10:26,887 --> 00:10:31,089
ignore damage. Nope, can't do that. Oh, we'll ignore ground matching. Nope, can't do that.

198
00:10:31,609 --> 00:10:39,192
So combat and I think, you know, you have on top of that, this goal of, of making it

199
00:10:39,392 --> 00:10:45,034
so that it isn't so simple that you can just push X, but isn't so complicated that the

200
00:10:45,194 --> 00:10:47,755
player's head explodes trying to deal with

201
00:10:48,204 --> 00:10:51,567
the control scheme and the different modalities.

202
00:10:51,627 --> 00:10:57,794
And so it was an elusive, nonstop effort for that team

203
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:02,240
over literally a six year journey,

204
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,402
continuing to work on that.

205
00:11:04,903 --> 00:11:06,805
And I think the results were really good,

206
00:11:06,885 --> 00:11:08,927
but it was a long, difficult road.

207
00:11:10,647 --> 00:11:18,713
Gotcha. We've got, we're going to pivot the discussion subject lately to talk about the game industry, getting into it, living in it, surviving in it.

208
00:11:19,374 --> 00:11:27,540
Both Connor Shaw and Christopher Zawodkowski would like, they're asking a question of the same vibe, so I'm going to read Connor's copy, but they're both asking it.

209
00:11:28,952 --> 00:11:40,561
Copy. Can you elaborate on your path into the game industry? Would you recommend your pathway to others hoping to break in? What are specific lessons you would impart on students and other hopefuls?

210
00:11:42,563 --> 00:11:48,388
Well, you know, I'm old enough that the industry has changed a ton, so I don't know my path is exactly right.

211
00:11:49,356 --> 00:11:53,377
I worked on games when I was a college student.

212
00:11:53,778 --> 00:11:57,279
I worked at Epix making an old Apple II game

213
00:11:57,339 --> 00:11:58,619
called California Games.

214
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,740
So I had some experience with it.

215
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,481
And then I walked away and worked in commercial software

216
00:12:03,501 --> 00:12:04,722
at Microsoft for a number of years,

217
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:08,123
and then came back to games when I started Sucker Punch.

218
00:12:08,163 --> 00:12:11,764
And so the start of Sucker Punch was pretty bruising

219
00:12:11,804 --> 00:12:14,145
because there weren't any really good entry points.

220
00:12:14,225 --> 00:12:16,786
PC gaming at that point was kind of,

221
00:12:17,256 --> 00:12:19,997
going really, really quite difficult.

222
00:12:20,897 --> 00:12:21,917
Console gaming was great,

223
00:12:21,957 --> 00:12:25,118
but you really had a tough time getting Nintendo

224
00:12:26,338 --> 00:12:29,499
or Sony to give you even a development kit

225
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,920
because you were a small, you know,

226
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,721
coming out of nowhere studio.

227
00:12:35,161 --> 00:12:38,101
And so I think right now it's actually better.

228
00:12:38,882 --> 00:12:41,122
It's a better situation because there's a ton

229
00:12:41,142 --> 00:12:44,283
of different platforms and entry points for small teams.

230
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:45,723
And my advice is,

231
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:53,168
Go make games, figure out how to make games and keep making them because we, you know,

232
00:12:53,308 --> 00:12:58,930
when we ship ghost, I, you know, I've said and I truly believe that anyone who ever worked

233
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:04,512
at Sucker Punch contributed to this project, because over the years that we've been making

234
00:13:04,552 --> 00:13:10,974
games, we've been learning how to in fact, make better and bigger games and we don't

235
00:13:11,034 --> 00:13:11,214
make.

236
00:13:12,017 --> 00:13:14,579
a ghost without infamous and we don't make infamous without

237
00:13:14,619 --> 00:13:17,842
sly and we didn't make sly without rocket like that series

238
00:13:17,882 --> 00:13:22,226
of games is is a journey that that we needed to go on. And so

239
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:27,370
my biggest advice is just make games find a way to make games

240
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:31,873
and and and, you know, continue that journey. There's no

241
00:13:31,954 --> 00:13:36,657
substitute for building and shipping games because you will

242
00:13:36,697 --> 00:13:39,460
learn more by doing that than I think anything else.

243
00:13:41,874 --> 00:13:49,856
While I grab the next question here in chat, excuse me, I just wanted to say that a couple

244
00:13:49,876 --> 00:13:52,857
folks did give a they said they gave a shout out to California game.

245
00:13:52,877 --> 00:13:55,418
So if anyone else played California games, I haven't right.

246
00:13:55,618 --> 00:14:00,640
Well, I wrote I wrote the assembly language, hacky sack and surfing game.

247
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,862
So if you want to go play, you know, get your emulator fired up and go play them.

248
00:14:06,482 --> 00:14:07,782
You know, those are the games I worked on.

249
00:14:09,284 --> 00:14:12,065
Um, uh, oh, Amelia, Sylar,

250
00:14:12,165 --> 00:14:17,007
I'll get a would would like to know what would be one thing you would have done

251
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:20,989
differently during the development of Ghost of Tsushima with obviously hindsight being 2020.

252
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:25,711
That's a good question. And one I really haven't thought a lot about.

253
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:30,573
I think the regrets that that when we talk about things as a team,

254
00:14:30,593 --> 00:14:35,895
you know, it's going back almost to the question about cutting. I feel like.

255
00:14:37,554 --> 00:14:41,175
we maybe waited too long on some of those cuts.

256
00:14:42,496 --> 00:14:44,697
And and it is it is really difficult.

257
00:14:44,777 --> 00:14:46,278
Oh, I know the answer to this question.

258
00:14:46,298 --> 00:14:47,118
I'll give you a different answer.

259
00:14:47,158 --> 00:14:51,400
So cutting, I think being brave about cutting earlier would have served us better.

260
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,661
I think we postponed some of those cuts.

261
00:14:53,721 --> 00:14:56,902
And as a result, we spent more time on the stuff that was going to get cut anyway.

262
00:14:57,923 --> 00:15:00,764
You know, I think if you're in doubt about things

263
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,846
on a game of this scope, you probably ought to cut it

264
00:15:04,226 --> 00:15:05,627
because you have so much other content.

265
00:15:06,293 --> 00:15:14,876
The other big, I think, aha lesson for us was that complexity will overwhelm the game and the player.

266
00:15:15,256 --> 00:15:19,697
And the reason for this is that the game is so big and has so many systems and interactions

267
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:29,501
that you tend to think about, hey, we're working on combat, or another team is working on navigation,

268
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:34,983
another team is working on mini games. And each of those teams can think, oh, I need to make my part

269
00:15:35,482 --> 00:15:37,444
individually rich and detailed.

270
00:15:37,744 --> 00:15:40,266
And the problem is when you have so many different components

271
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:42,889
and they're all rich and detailed, the player can get overwhelmed.

272
00:15:43,389 --> 00:15:47,933
So I think if I had any big takeaway that I wish I knew

273
00:15:48,353 --> 00:15:52,817
that going from going in was make sure that each of the individual systems

274
00:15:52,877 --> 00:15:56,220
are almost held to the standard of being as simple as you can make them

275
00:15:57,721 --> 00:16:01,024
rather than thinking, oh, each one needs to be complicated.

276
00:16:01,064 --> 00:16:03,586
You ought to really focus on each one being simpler.

277
00:16:04,273 --> 00:16:07,979
because the combination of all of them is actually quite complicated, so.

278
00:16:07,999 --> 00:16:11,485
Ooh, that was a really thorough answer.

279
00:16:12,607 --> 00:16:14,570
Joaquin de la Sada would like to know,

280
00:16:14,771 --> 00:16:18,256
how do you guys know how long a game production will take to make?

281
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,848
and how do you all make sure that the company

282
00:16:20,948 --> 00:16:22,289
is able to meet the deadlines?

283
00:16:22,369 --> 00:16:23,730
Obviously game production is fluid,

284
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:26,012
but it's still a, you know, scheduling.

285
00:16:26,232 --> 00:16:27,954
It's how games get made.

286
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:29,695
Well, the real answer is we didn't.

287
00:16:31,756 --> 00:16:34,639
We are in a situation and we're very fortunate

288
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:38,121
to be in a situation where our relationship with Sony,

289
00:16:38,802 --> 00:16:40,783
you know, and we've made, you know,

290
00:16:41,184 --> 00:16:43,425
games together for, you know,

291
00:16:43,485 --> 00:16:44,866
almost two decades at this point.

292
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:54,723
I think we have a very healthy relationship with them where we both understand that the real goal was to make a game like Ghost.

293
00:16:55,003 --> 00:16:57,304
It wasn't to make a game at a particular date.

294
00:16:57,824 --> 00:17:05,686
It was to create something that was a great experience for players and that that's the most, it was a new IP,

295
00:17:06,447 --> 00:17:10,528
and it needed to reach a certain level of success.

296
00:17:10,668 --> 00:17:14,710
And so if that took us a little longer, that was the right path.

297
00:17:15,043 --> 00:17:18,804
But that only comes because Sony is confident

298
00:17:19,024 --> 00:17:20,745
that we're not being wasteful

299
00:17:21,285 --> 00:17:25,846
and that we're really diligently protecting their investment

300
00:17:26,427 --> 00:17:28,967
or we are continuing to make progress.

301
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:32,369
But that, it would be quite difficult, I think.

302
00:17:33,449 --> 00:17:36,630
We did not originally forecast a six-year project

303
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:40,971
and it was on the strength of the progress we'd made

304
00:17:41,492 --> 00:17:43,432
and on the strength of our relationship with Sony.

305
00:17:43,973 --> 00:17:47,233
that everybody agreed we should keep investing

306
00:17:47,953 --> 00:17:51,694
to try and find the true diamond that we thought was there,

307
00:17:52,274 --> 00:17:54,055
even if it meant it was gonna take a little longer.

308
00:17:54,135 --> 00:17:59,255
So it was a difficult miss and we were not close.

309
00:18:00,056 --> 00:18:02,276
We did not forecast, oh, five and a half

310
00:18:02,316 --> 00:18:03,176
and it turned into six.

311
00:18:04,276 --> 00:18:06,297
We were not close on how long it would take.

312
00:18:06,317 --> 00:18:10,297
And again, I think it's really just a reflection

313
00:18:10,377 --> 00:18:11,978
on our relationship with Sony

314
00:18:12,018 --> 00:18:13,318
that we were able to finish.

315
00:18:13,814 --> 00:18:15,075
and complete such a good game.

316
00:18:15,696 --> 00:18:16,816
Yeah.

317
00:18:17,017 --> 00:18:19,518
Alexandra Soria would like to know how,

318
00:18:19,678 --> 00:18:21,440
and this may be a question more for the programming side,

319
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,341
but it resonated with me

320
00:18:23,401 --> 00:18:24,842
because I loved the fast loading so much

321
00:18:24,862 --> 00:18:25,683
that I wanted to ask it.

322
00:18:26,484 --> 00:18:28,865
How did the team manage to achieve such an optimization

323
00:18:28,905 --> 00:18:31,527
that it made it possible to load the game so fast?

324
00:18:33,889 --> 00:18:35,050
It's a great question.

325
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:37,912
And I have to say, we were all pretty shocked

326
00:18:38,612 --> 00:18:39,813
at the reaction.

327
00:18:40,074 --> 00:18:42,315
Again, we lived in this world.

328
00:18:42,748 --> 00:18:45,851
where the game worked the way it worked for years.

329
00:18:46,311 --> 00:18:49,653
And so I think when we shipped and the news was like, oh, my God,

330
00:18:49,673 --> 00:18:50,414
the game was the best.

331
00:18:50,434 --> 00:18:54,016
And we kind of had taken it for granted how big of a deal it was.

332
00:18:55,337 --> 00:18:59,260
The the engineering team did a spectacular job

333
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,363
at and the art team once the engineers had done their work.

334
00:19:03,703 --> 00:19:06,745
I really understanding what was sort of core to the game.

335
00:19:06,785 --> 00:19:08,326
And we didn't have to reload all the time.

336
00:19:08,763 --> 00:19:13,026
and then what was localized in and around the player

337
00:19:13,046 --> 00:19:14,006
and that we could bring in.

338
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:16,588
And they did some clever things

339
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:19,629
where we have really low resolution versions

340
00:19:19,889 --> 00:19:21,450
of all the textures in the game

341
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:25,392
so that we can begin to do the fades

342
00:19:25,933 --> 00:19:28,074
while we're still finishing the last little bits.

343
00:19:28,454 --> 00:19:30,415
So there's cleverness here,

344
00:19:30,475 --> 00:19:32,976
but the truth is that I think if you had Adrian,

345
00:19:33,037 --> 00:19:34,297
one of our lead engineers on,

346
00:19:34,717 --> 00:19:36,979
he'd tell you it was just the basics.

347
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:37,619
It was just...

348
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:43,990
being careful about organizing the data so that it could be loaded without seeking the head all over

349
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:50,256
and it was just good solid engineering work and then of course the artists did a great job working

350
00:19:50,296 --> 00:19:54,120
within those constraints so kind of ordinary success.

351
00:19:55,401 --> 00:19:58,684
Speaking of artists, that is what you call a segue.

352
00:19:59,344 --> 00:20:01,006
Valerie Bourdon has a great question.

353
00:20:01,406 --> 00:20:03,909
One of the most memorable elements from Ghost of Tsushima

354
00:20:03,929 --> 00:20:05,690
were the visuals and the art direction.

355
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:06,811
Yeah. I agree, Valerie.

356
00:20:07,452 --> 00:20:10,014
How did you go, how did Sucker Punch go about creating assets

357
00:20:10,054 --> 00:20:11,996
that were historically accurate

358
00:20:12,076 --> 00:20:14,038
and yet had a dynamic and vibrant feel?

359
00:20:14,078 --> 00:20:15,319
And I guess we can throw in there

360
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:18,002
that they also were, you know, optimized

361
00:20:18,062 --> 00:20:20,124
and worked within the constraints of the engine, I guess.

362
00:20:21,461 --> 00:20:25,603
Yeah, you know, Jason Cannell, who leads the art team

363
00:20:25,944 --> 00:20:27,605
and was the art director on the project.

364
00:20:28,505 --> 00:20:31,287
I think one of the things that we had from the beginning

365
00:20:31,327 --> 00:20:34,049
was a fairly clear idea of what we were trying to do

366
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:36,970
with the game, and that certainly includes the visuals.

367
00:20:38,391 --> 00:20:42,214
And as we started pushing forward on things

368
00:20:42,234 --> 00:20:43,855
that we wanted to achieve visually,

369
00:20:45,255 --> 00:20:48,377
you know, a lot of the inspiration came from the source material, you look at

370
00:20:48,518 --> 00:20:53,942
Curacao movies, and all the movement and wind that he used. And so that was a big

371
00:20:54,082 --> 00:21:01,328
push for the team to capture that sense of movement. And so that was an early

372
00:21:01,368 --> 00:21:05,552
investment point. And then early in the project, the team made a couple trips to

373
00:21:05,592 --> 00:21:09,916
Japan, and they go to Tsushima. And they, they went to historically

374
00:21:10,972 --> 00:21:16,814
preserved locations to kind of draw that inspiration from the reality and the combination of all of that

375
00:21:17,435 --> 00:21:23,257
leads you into the directions that we went. So, you know, you have kind of the source material

376
00:21:23,357 --> 00:21:28,019
and visits to the Tsushima, you have the inspiration from the Kurosawa films, and then our

377
00:21:28,719 --> 00:21:35,082
exploration really was just how do we capture that? And I think the last really big,

378
00:21:35,482 --> 00:21:38,944
you know, center point for Jason was just continuing to

379
00:21:39,838 --> 00:21:42,540
try and remove noise from everything,

380
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,042
to look at the individual textures, the individual shapes,

381
00:21:46,603 --> 00:21:50,565
and look for simpler, less sort of noisy shapes,

382
00:21:50,926 --> 00:21:53,748
because it added a sort of sense of calmness to the world.

383
00:21:53,768 --> 00:21:55,749
I think the combination of all of that,

384
00:21:55,769 --> 00:21:58,111
and it's just a long journey,

385
00:21:59,252 --> 00:22:00,873
but hopefully a successful one.

386
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:06,353
Yeah, Antti Lenonen here has a great question, I think,

387
00:22:06,393 --> 00:22:07,333
is about leadership.

388
00:22:08,334 --> 00:22:10,015
Usually in a game project, at the start,

389
00:22:10,075 --> 00:22:11,757
everything is shiny and exciting.

390
00:22:11,857 --> 00:22:14,519
After working on something day to day for many years,

391
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:17,000
the shine and excitement naturally fade away

392
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,441
and it becomes hard to stay motivated.

393
00:22:18,882 --> 00:22:20,783
How has your team stayed motivated

394
00:22:20,803 --> 00:22:22,144
for such a long production cycle?

395
00:22:22,184 --> 00:22:23,425
And I'll tack on to the end of that,

396
00:22:24,045 --> 00:22:25,466
as a studio co-founder,

397
00:22:25,606 --> 00:22:27,368
what are the ways you think you can do

398
00:22:27,408 --> 00:22:29,229
to help keep folks motivated as a leader?

399
00:22:30,116 --> 00:22:32,317
Well, I don't think we have any secrets.

400
00:22:32,357 --> 00:22:36,098
I think that the first thing that really helped us on the project was that the,

401
00:22:36,138 --> 00:22:38,858
I thought the vision for the game was really compelling, you know,

402
00:22:38,878 --> 00:22:41,119
that we weren't talking ourselves into it.

403
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:46,581
We believe from the beginning that this was the right project and that it was a,

404
00:22:46,961 --> 00:22:49,401
it was a going to be a successful idea.

405
00:22:49,461 --> 00:22:52,982
Now the challenge is that even after you do the initial pitch, you know,

406
00:22:53,082 --> 00:22:56,483
years before you ship the game, I always think that, um,

407
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,220
after I've pitched to 100 people at the studio,

408
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,300
you know, we show the slideshow,

409
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,441
there are a hundred different pictures

410
00:23:02,501 --> 00:23:04,761
of what this game is gonna be at that moment, right?

411
00:23:05,141 --> 00:23:06,961
Each person has heard that presentation

412
00:23:06,982 --> 00:23:08,002
and they have an idea.

413
00:23:08,022 --> 00:23:09,942
And those ideas are similar,

414
00:23:10,082 --> 00:23:11,702
but they're definitely not the same

415
00:23:11,762 --> 00:23:13,123
because one person is thinking,

416
00:23:13,563 --> 00:23:17,423
oh, the combat is gonna be, you know, souls-like,

417
00:23:17,503 --> 00:23:18,724
you know, it's gonna be blood-borne

418
00:23:18,744 --> 00:23:19,684
because they just played that.

419
00:23:19,724 --> 00:23:20,704
And another person's thinking,

420
00:23:20,784 --> 00:23:22,244
oh, the game is Breath of the Wild.

421
00:23:22,904 --> 00:23:24,225
And another person is thinking,

422
00:23:25,064 --> 00:23:29,106
You know, oh, no, it's going to be infamous because that's the game we just made.

423
00:23:29,146 --> 00:23:31,127
And it's going to really be different.

424
00:23:31,247 --> 00:23:37,370
And the journey is really helping everybody's vision of the game kind of converge over time.

425
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:48,456
Right. And it doesn't converge uniformly, but you try and so every six weeks we get together as a team and we do a review of our progress.

426
00:23:49,016 --> 00:23:52,978
And we would try and select demonstrations of progress we've made.

427
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:55,312
For two things, you wanted progress

428
00:23:55,332 --> 00:23:57,473
that was individually exciting,

429
00:23:57,613 --> 00:24:00,035
and maybe it was a tool demonstration

430
00:24:00,155 --> 00:24:02,897
or an exciting visual effect that we were gonna have,

431
00:24:02,917 --> 00:24:03,918
and that's inspiring,

432
00:24:04,198 --> 00:24:06,499
but then also things that would help converge

433
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,242
everybody's idea of what the game was gonna be.

434
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,884
And so if we knew that,

435
00:24:13,304 --> 00:24:14,765
one of our ideas was that we knew

436
00:24:14,785 --> 00:24:17,267
it was gonna be an M-rated game.

437
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:22,052
right? But we wanted to talk about that because some people think of M-rated game as you run

438
00:24:22,092 --> 00:24:28,095
around and you chop heads off all the time. And so we had to actually have conversations about

439
00:24:28,495 --> 00:24:34,479
how does violence get used in the game and where would if somebody's, you know, going to lose,

440
00:24:34,499 --> 00:24:37,700
you know, if we're actually going to chop someone's head off, we're only going to do

441
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,322
that in narrative. We're not going to do that systemically. And why do we feel that way? And so

442
00:24:41,802 --> 00:24:47,085
all of that was about helping each of the hundred people who heard that pitch.

443
00:24:47,717 --> 00:24:52,585
start seeing more and more of the same game. And that process continues

444
00:24:52,725 --> 00:24:55,049
throughout the entirety of development, but it's a really

445
00:24:55,109 --> 00:25:00,357
essential part of, of building new IP. It's what makes new IP so

446
00:25:00,438 --> 00:25:00,878
challenging.

447
00:25:02,312 --> 00:25:06,693
God, I want to dig into the decision around the mature violence that you just said, but

448
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:07,013
we don't.

449
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:07,994
I'd love to.

450
00:25:08,154 --> 00:25:08,834
Don't have time for that.

451
00:25:08,914 --> 00:25:09,594
Got to keep moving.

452
00:25:09,994 --> 00:25:13,836
Before I grab the last few questions for today, we've only got about five minutes left.

453
00:25:14,796 --> 00:25:16,697
So we're going to get one or two more before we get out.

454
00:25:16,997 --> 00:25:19,998
Before we go, I just wanted to tell everyone they should totally stick around.

455
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:25,040
We've got more great free sessions today, the rest of the week, more great folks from

456
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,600
the team, you know, the Demon Souls team.

457
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:32,184
the Spider-Man Morales team are going to be here later in the week, the GDC live podcast. I am so

458
00:25:32,244 --> 00:25:37,948
excited for all the stuff you guys get to watch just by sticking around here on Swapcard. Also,

459
00:25:38,008 --> 00:25:41,271
before they go, Brian, if there are any questions we didn't have time for today,

460
00:25:41,571 --> 00:25:45,554
is there a way they can ask them? Is there a way they can get follow-up? What do you recommend?

461
00:25:46,916 --> 00:25:47,876
You know, that's a good question.

462
00:25:47,896 --> 00:25:48,996
I would have turned it back to you.

463
00:25:49,076 --> 00:25:51,677
Is there a process for them to get you a list of questions?

464
00:25:51,837 --> 00:25:54,238
I, you know, I'm certain we can do an email with you,

465
00:25:54,338 --> 00:25:56,319
but all the questions are on your,

466
00:25:56,499 --> 00:25:57,760
they're on your screen right now.

467
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,280
Excellent, good point.

468
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,722
We will, you know what, we will figure something out

469
00:26:02,782 --> 00:26:04,222
and we're going to go back to the questions now

470
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:05,723
for the rest of our time here, all questions.

471
00:26:06,183 --> 00:26:07,723
Okay, Thomas Bellotti would like to know

472
00:26:07,804 --> 00:26:10,044
what technology are you the most excited about

473
00:26:10,084 --> 00:26:12,385
for the future of game-making across any discipline?

474
00:26:14,033 --> 00:26:14,834
What am I excited about?

475
00:26:15,134 --> 00:26:18,594
You know, the thing that I'm the most excited to get to try

476
00:26:19,215 --> 00:26:23,175
is the new PS5 storage system.

477
00:26:23,736 --> 00:26:26,736
The loading systems there will change the way

478
00:26:26,776 --> 00:26:28,977
that we think about how we make games.

479
00:26:29,117 --> 00:26:34,378
It's so fast that even the idea of unloading the things

480
00:26:34,398 --> 00:26:36,458
that are just off screen on the camera,

481
00:26:36,718 --> 00:26:39,739
and as the player turns, bringing them in just in time

482
00:26:40,219 --> 00:26:42,500
is possible, and that really fundamentally could change.

483
00:26:42,873 --> 00:26:44,393
how we think about making games.

484
00:26:44,473 --> 00:26:46,834
So lots of exploration to do there,

485
00:26:46,894 --> 00:26:49,575
but I'm intrigued by what that could mean for us.

486
00:26:50,436 --> 00:26:51,496
Ooh.

487
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:55,037
Alexis, Harrington has an interesting question.

488
00:26:55,057 --> 00:26:56,278
In researching for the game,

489
00:26:56,298 --> 00:26:57,858
we talked up front about researching,

490
00:26:57,878 --> 00:26:59,859
you know, and you've mentioned before,

491
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:00,920
visiting Tsushima itself.

492
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,480
In researching the game,

493
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,181
were there any specific resources

494
00:27:04,221 --> 00:27:05,821
that the team found extremely helpful?

495
00:27:06,481 --> 00:27:08,622
beyond we've mentioned the so before, but I guess if there's

496
00:27:08,662 --> 00:27:09,602
anything you want to throw in?

497
00:27:10,042 --> 00:27:13,803
Well, I mean, the critical thing is, is is people, you know, is

498
00:27:13,903 --> 00:27:18,444
having the right individuals. For me, you know, there was a

499
00:27:18,624 --> 00:27:24,766
there was a book, the Mongol invasions of 1274. And subsequent

500
00:27:24,786 --> 00:27:28,147
invasion that that was really helpful for me at just getting

501
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:32,328
oriented into the content. And certainly lots of people looked

502
00:27:32,368 --> 00:27:35,008
at that. And there's, there's numerous reference books.

503
00:27:35,459 --> 00:27:38,061
But I think in the end, the critical, critical thing

504
00:27:38,101 --> 00:27:42,905
was finding people who knew the culture, knew the history,

505
00:27:43,565 --> 00:27:48,029
and who were able to guide us with their expertise.

506
00:27:48,069 --> 00:27:51,652
It was really more about that than a particular resource.

507
00:27:52,032 --> 00:27:52,973
Yeah.

508
00:27:53,313 --> 00:27:54,574
I think this might be our last question.

509
00:27:54,594 --> 00:27:57,797
Rahul Mann has kind of a leadership question.

510
00:27:58,097 --> 00:27:59,358
Since you've been around for a while,

511
00:27:59,398 --> 00:28:00,899
what do you think are some of the main directions

512
00:28:00,939 --> 00:28:02,421
that Sucker Punch took as a company

513
00:28:02,741 --> 00:28:05,003
and as developers to stick around for so long?

514
00:28:06,837 --> 00:28:10,598
You know, I think we've been relatively conservative about hardware.

515
00:28:10,658 --> 00:28:14,059
So we never used our games, never required some kind of add on.

516
00:28:14,099 --> 00:28:16,320
It was always sort of aiming at the big part of the market.

517
00:28:16,941 --> 00:28:18,341
We've chosen great partners.

518
00:28:18,981 --> 00:28:21,502
You know, we worked with Ubisoft first and Sony second.

519
00:28:22,282 --> 00:28:24,783
And we we you know, that's really been helpful.

520
00:28:25,664 --> 00:28:29,745
I think we've also always viewed our publishers as partners

521
00:28:30,285 --> 00:28:31,846
rather than as adversaries.

522
00:28:32,846 --> 00:28:34,647
And I think that's really helped us.

523
00:28:34,667 --> 00:28:34,927
So I think.

524
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:41,214
Last, we probably over index on realizing that our team isn't

525
00:28:41,274 --> 00:28:45,777
just the Sucker Punch employees, it's our banker and our lawyer

526
00:28:46,098 --> 00:28:51,341
and our, you know, the person at who does the insurance, who

527
00:28:51,361 --> 00:28:54,464
sold us insurance, that really kind of expansively thinking

528
00:28:54,504 --> 00:28:58,066
about your team, not as those people are vendors, but those

529
00:28:58,126 --> 00:29:00,488
are teammates. I think the more you can

530
00:29:01,147 --> 00:29:02,328
really invest in those rel

531
00:29:02,368 --> 00:29:03,750
the more when the moment

532
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:04,712
them, uh, you will have b

533
00:29:04,992 --> 00:29:06,094
that lets you get through

534
00:29:15,052 --> 00:29:18,533
Roger that. Well, Brian, thank you so much for joining us today.

535
00:29:18,573 --> 00:29:20,014
We've got to start wrapping things up.

536
00:29:20,474 --> 00:29:23,415
Yeah, we can't wait to see what's next for Sucker Punch Productions.

537
00:29:23,515 --> 00:29:25,576
And who knows, maybe I'll just hop off when I'm done today

538
00:29:25,616 --> 00:29:27,157
and go play some more Ghost of Tsushima.

539
00:29:27,857 --> 00:29:28,278
Sounds good.

540
00:29:28,958 --> 00:29:31,259
I'm going to go ahead and wrap us up a little early.

541
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:33,220
Thank you so much. I hope everyone has a good day.

542
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,021
And like I said before, stick around.

543
00:29:35,061 --> 00:29:37,502
There's more great things happening at GDC Showcase this week.

544
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:38,162
Bye, everyone.

545
00:29:38,442 --> 00:29:39,043
Thanks, everyone.
