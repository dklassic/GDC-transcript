00:00:06,298 --> 00:00:09,200
Hi, I'm Chris Zimmerman. I'm studio head emeritus at Sucker Punch.

2
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,963
I did a lot of work on melee combat in Ghost of Tsushima, so for the next hour or so,

3
00:00:14,003 --> 00:00:17,104
I'm going to try to pass along some of the things we learned while working on Ghost.

4
00:00:17,665 --> 00:00:21,567
Since I'm going to cherry pick a few things that worked well and skip all the things that

5
00:00:21,587 --> 00:00:26,189
didn't work well at all, it's pretty much a normal GDC talk. Here's how the rest of the

6
00:00:26,229 --> 00:00:31,092
talk is laid out. I'm going to outline five basic problems we ran into trying to get melee

7
00:00:31,112 --> 00:00:35,154
combat to work. I've got a case study or two of a particular instance of each problem type.

8
00:00:35,644 --> 00:00:37,224
And after going through the case studies,

9
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:38,625
I'll summarize what we learned

10
00:00:38,645 --> 00:00:40,565
with a catchy sounding rule about game design.

11
00:00:40,985 --> 00:00:41,705
At the end of the talk,

12
00:00:41,745 --> 00:00:43,745
I'll give you a slide with all five of these rules

13
00:00:43,786 --> 00:00:44,486
for game design.

14
00:00:45,066 --> 00:00:47,026
Also, I did a lot of the programming on this stuff,

15
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:48,686
so there are some technical details.

16
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:50,887
The technical details are gonna be uninteresting

17
00:00:50,927 --> 00:00:51,767
to many of you,

18
00:00:51,867 --> 00:00:53,487
so I'm not gonna talk about them in the talk.

19
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:56,288
Instead, I'm gonna take advantage of the special nature

20
00:00:56,328 --> 00:00:59,148
of this year's GDC by dropping them as text

21
00:00:59,188 --> 00:01:00,108
into the chat window

22
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:01,689
when we hit the appropriate part of the talk.

23
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:03,649
So watch the chat window for the notes.

24
00:01:07,825 --> 00:01:09,327
Next time, I'll remember to do the slides.

25
00:01:10,449 --> 00:01:13,333
I'm guessing most of you have played at least some of Ghost.

26
00:01:13,413 --> 00:01:15,276
If you haven't, I recommend doing so.

27
00:01:15,556 --> 00:01:16,798
First of all, it's an excellent game.

28
00:01:17,339 --> 00:01:18,821
Second, a lot of what I'm going to talk about

29
00:01:18,881 --> 00:01:20,223
is going to make sense if you haven't.

30
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:26,355
But a quick recap just to remind you what the game's about. Ghost of Tsushima is an open world

31
00:01:26,475 --> 00:01:32,439
action RPG set during the first Mongol invasion of Japan in 1274. This invasion really happened,

32
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:37,223
it's historical fact, including the subjugation of the island of Tsushima. In real life,

33
00:01:37,383 --> 00:01:39,405
the 80 samurai on the island were all killed.

34
00:01:39,765 --> 00:01:43,087
In our story, one samurai, Jin Sakai, survives the opening battle

35
00:01:43,107 --> 00:01:44,848
and decides to fight back against the Mongols.

36
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:46,549
He's massively outnumbered.

37
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:48,871
In order to fight back, he is forced, bit by bit,

38
00:01:48,911 --> 00:01:51,453
to abandon everything he's been taught about being a samurai.

39
00:01:52,193 --> 00:01:53,654
Jin learns to fight from the shadows,

40
00:01:53,834 --> 00:01:56,156
sacrificing his samurai identity to save his home.

41
00:01:56,596 --> 00:01:57,617
So that's the setup.

42
00:01:58,077 --> 00:02:00,359
Here are three primary goals that constrain...

43
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,441
or goals slash constraints we adopted while building the game.

44
00:02:04,184 --> 00:02:06,685
First, the game is immersive.

45
00:02:07,105 --> 00:02:09,865
Our overarching goal was to build a time machine

46
00:02:09,905 --> 00:02:11,946
to transport the player back in place and time

47
00:02:11,986 --> 00:02:14,526
to ancient Japan so that everything melts away

48
00:02:14,746 --> 00:02:17,327
and you just feel like a samurai on Tsushima Island

49
00:02:17,407 --> 00:02:18,667
fighting off hordes of Mongols.

50
00:02:19,167 --> 00:02:20,367
Second, the game's grounded.

51
00:02:20,867 --> 00:02:23,048
While we were trying to build a historically accurate game,

52
00:02:23,108 --> 00:02:24,708
we were trying to build a believable one.

53
00:02:24,988 --> 00:02:26,689
That means no monsters and no magic,

54
00:02:27,029 --> 00:02:28,289
just mud, blood, and steel,

55
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:30,629
the catchphrase we use to keep ourselves honest.

56
00:02:31,009 --> 00:02:32,210
And third, the game's accessible.

57
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:35,953
For Ghost to justify, it's not insignificant budget.

58
00:02:36,354 --> 00:02:39,617
It needed to appeal to a broad audience. We didn't set out to make a niche game.

59
00:02:39,657 --> 00:02:41,919
We set out to make a game that millions of people would enjoy.

60
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:45,503
These three goals slash constraints shaped a lot of the design,

61
00:02:45,543 --> 00:02:47,124
so keep them in mind as we move forward.

62
00:02:48,145 --> 00:02:50,508
So how does melee combat fit into the game?

63
00:02:50,788 --> 00:02:55,032
Well, melee combat, and specifically katana combat, is central to the samurai fantasy.

64
00:02:55,172 --> 00:02:56,734
Without katana combat that looked and felt

65
00:02:58,927 --> 00:03:01,248
Furthermore, melee combat is the backbone

66
00:03:01,288 --> 00:03:02,429
of the story we were telling.

67
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:04,930
The whole story relies on Jin Sakai being forced

68
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,031
by the sheer number of enemies

69
00:03:06,071 --> 00:03:07,452
to adopt underhanded tactics.

70
00:03:07,952 --> 00:03:09,373
If you can just hack and slash your way

71
00:03:09,393 --> 00:03:11,414
through melee encounters without fighting dirty,

72
00:03:11,514 --> 00:03:12,655
then the story falls apart.

73
00:03:13,015 --> 00:03:15,136
The whole story hinges on melee combat

74
00:03:15,176 --> 00:03:16,417
or overwhelming you as a player,

75
00:03:17,057 --> 00:03:17,998
while still feeling fair,

76
00:03:18,478 --> 00:03:20,519
just as it overwhelms Jin to force you

77
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:23,401
into these decisions Jin doesn't want to make.

78
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:27,491
Now, the samurai fantasy about melee combat is broad.

79
00:03:27,732 --> 00:03:30,013
Fighting in a duel with a single worthy enemy

80
00:03:30,053 --> 00:03:30,773
is certainly part of it.

81
00:03:31,213 --> 00:03:33,134
So is a desperate fight with one surrounded

82
00:03:33,174 --> 00:03:34,015
by a group of opponents.

83
00:03:34,235 --> 00:03:36,256
And so is fighting alongside your fellow samurai

84
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:37,177
in an epic battle.

85
00:03:37,797 --> 00:03:40,558
Ghost melee combat needs to smoothly span this whole gamut

86
00:03:40,798 --> 00:03:43,520
from pure brawler action to a challenging one-on-one duel.

87
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,901
And that's a tall order,

88
00:03:45,381 --> 00:03:47,722
especially since the last melee-focused game we'd built

89
00:03:47,782 --> 00:03:50,003
shipped 15 years ago and featured a talking raccoon.

90
00:03:51,117 --> 00:03:54,281
So let's be more precise about what constitutes the samurai fantasy.

91
00:03:54,621 --> 00:04:00,588
For Ghost, we decided the core of the samurai fantasy is discipline and precision, precise

92
00:04:00,628 --> 00:04:05,674
control with every movement having a purpose, a sense of stillness and readiness despite danger,

93
00:04:06,115 --> 00:04:09,058
and a burst of explosive action at exactly the right moment.

94
00:04:09,774 --> 00:04:12,095
And discipline in all things. Discipline in the moment,

95
00:04:12,155 --> 00:04:14,435
to hold back on action until the perfect opportunity.

96
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:17,036
Discipline over time as your extended practice

97
00:04:17,076 --> 00:04:19,276
and hard work leads to mastery over the katana

98
00:04:19,296 --> 00:04:22,177
and the other soldierly arts that you study.

99
00:04:23,157 --> 00:04:25,738
And progression is part of the samurai fantasy too.

100
00:04:26,638 --> 00:04:29,179
Determined, disciplined hard work over time

101
00:04:29,299 --> 00:04:30,139
leading to mastery.

102
00:04:30,559 --> 00:04:32,060
That's not dissimilar to the experience

103
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,280
of playing the game actually.

104
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,940
So keeping the player's journey in tune

105
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,501
with Jin's journey was an important goal.

106
00:04:37,296 --> 00:04:41,400
Above all, the samurai in our mind's eye was skillful, a master of the katana.

107
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:44,563
So we needed to decide how the player showed skill.

108
00:04:45,564 --> 00:04:47,766
There are lots of ways for players to show skill in games.

109
00:04:51,868 --> 00:04:57,955
characters, as is the case in many melee games, we chose two things. First, precise timing to echo

110
00:04:57,995 --> 00:05:03,361
the precision of the samurai fantasy. And two, second, a quick and accurate reaction to enemy actions,

111
00:05:04,222 --> 00:05:08,287
both having to be demonstrated and performed under high pressure from your enemies.

112
00:05:08,927 --> 00:05:10,349
But there's a problem with this choice.

113
00:05:10,409 --> 00:05:12,130
Human reaction times are slower than you think.

114
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,993
For a simple visual stimulus in a simple player response,

115
00:05:15,233 --> 00:05:16,514
it's maybe 300 milliseconds.

116
00:05:16,854 --> 00:05:18,175
That's slower than you can swing a sword.

117
00:05:18,195 --> 00:05:20,437
It's slower than Jin's fast attacks in the game,

118
00:05:20,617 --> 00:05:21,878
which take less than 250 milliseconds.

119
00:05:23,629 --> 00:05:24,709
You can work around this, though.

120
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,351
There's no limit on enemy reaction times.

121
00:05:27,591 --> 00:05:30,914
In many circumstances, they can and should react instantly to player action.

122
00:05:31,374 --> 00:05:35,197
In fact, we did some early work to give NPCs more reasonable human reaction times.

123
00:05:35,557 --> 00:05:39,140
For instance, we had NPCs react to your movement with a human-scale delay.

124
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,282
If you dodged to your left, the NPCs took a few hundred milliseconds to track.

125
00:05:42,857 --> 00:05:44,457
And this was a disaster. It felt wrong.

126
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:46,838
Sloppy, buggy, didn't feel right at all.

127
00:05:47,359 --> 00:05:49,280
And I think this is because our expectations

128
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,861
for what a sword fight looks like are formed by movies.

129
00:05:52,361 --> 00:05:53,581
And movies aren't very realistic.

130
00:05:53,802 --> 00:05:55,442
Everything is choreographed so the actors know

131
00:05:55,482 --> 00:05:56,483
what's going to happen next.

132
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:58,584
They're anticipating, they're not reacting.

133
00:05:59,024 --> 00:06:01,185
Real sword fights, like real fights of any sort,

134
00:06:01,225 --> 00:06:02,185
are incredibly messy.

135
00:06:02,546 --> 00:06:03,906
But the fantasy we're trying to hit

136
00:06:04,026 --> 00:06:06,667
is the movie fantasy of a sword fight, clean and precise.

137
00:06:07,028 --> 00:06:08,648
So enemies track your movement instantly.

138
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:14,132
Tech note. It's worth noting that human reaction times are slow,

139
00:06:14,192 --> 00:06:16,434
but human anticipation can be close to perfect.

140
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:18,336
It takes a while to react to a stimulus,

141
00:06:18,856 --> 00:06:21,018
but you can all clap along to the beat of a song.

142
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:28,864
And one main goal, one final goal slash constraint for combat

143
00:06:28,924 --> 00:06:30,726
is that we wanted the game to be purely skill-based.

144
00:06:30,906 --> 00:06:33,668
And part of this decision was that if you play the game perfectly,

145
00:06:33,728 --> 00:06:34,449
you won't get hit.

146
00:06:35,034 --> 00:06:36,735
No matter how many enemies are attacking you,

147
00:06:37,555 --> 00:06:41,076
if you do the right actions at the right time, you will not get hit.

148
00:06:41,296 --> 00:06:43,257
This felt like the right fit for the Samurai fantasy,

149
00:06:43,617 --> 00:06:46,058
that if you played perfectly, you could dance between the raindrops

150
00:06:46,218 --> 00:06:48,618
and make it through any situation unscathed.

151
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:50,459
So where does that leave us?

152
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:54,680
Well, initial enemy attacks have a wind-up so that you have time to react.

153
00:06:55,221 --> 00:06:57,521
Follow-up enemy attacks in a combo can be fast

154
00:06:57,661 --> 00:06:59,422
since you're anticipating instead of reacting.

155
00:07:00,082 --> 00:07:03,763
And player attacks can also be fast since NPC reaction times aren't limited.

156
00:07:05,103 --> 00:07:08,046
But we ran into an immediate problem with this basic design.

157
00:07:08,667 --> 00:07:10,889
Quick attacks with Square were too effective.

158
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,713
We assumed, the reasonable assumption,

159
00:07:13,753 --> 00:07:16,155
that stabbing someone with a sword would interrupt their action.

160
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,939
We were trying to stay grounded, so this seemed like a reasonable decision.

161
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,023
But with slow NPC wind-ups to let the player react,

162
00:07:23,103 --> 00:07:24,204
and fast player attacks,

163
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:26,847
you could just poke guys during their wind-up and win.

164
00:07:28,592 --> 00:07:29,573
This did not test well.

165
00:07:30,213 --> 00:07:32,014
Button mashing was an effective strategy,

166
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:34,876
but it didn't feel very skillful, and it wasn't very fun.

167
00:07:35,396 --> 00:07:37,697
And honestly, we might have rebooted the whole approach

168
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:39,278
at this point if I weren't studio head,

169
00:07:39,498 --> 00:07:41,119
as well as the guy working on combat,

170
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:42,760
which gave me a certain amount of latitude

171
00:07:43,401 --> 00:07:44,061
to stay the course.

172
00:07:44,521 --> 00:07:46,863
Most immediately, though, we needed to work out ways

173
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,303
to blunt the square spam problem.

174
00:07:49,024 --> 00:07:50,545
We looked for natural limits,

175
00:07:50,885 --> 00:07:52,606
believable ways to stop quick attacks

176
00:07:52,626 --> 00:07:53,606
from being too effective.

177
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,267
So we added a shieldman archetype

178
00:07:55,307 --> 00:07:56,308
that blocked quick attacks.

179
00:07:56,388 --> 00:07:58,169
This made sense to players, they didn't object.

180
00:07:58,768 --> 00:08:04,768
Later on, we added Brutes, big guys, guys who were so big that poking them with a sword wouldn't interrupt their attacks.

181
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:05,671
And this also worked.

182
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:09,948
But more importantly, we started overlapping enemy attack sequences.

183
00:08:10,288 --> 00:08:12,489
We recognized that we can start an NPC wind-up

184
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:16,371
while the last NPC was still finishing their attack sequence.

185
00:08:16,892 --> 00:08:19,233
As long as all the attacks landed at distinct times,

186
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:20,994
the sequences could overlap.

187
00:08:21,414 --> 00:08:23,355
This turned multiple enemies attacking to you

188
00:08:23,495 --> 00:08:26,257
effectively into a single sequence with a long wind-up

189
00:08:26,477 --> 00:08:28,738
only happening really at the beginning of the sequence.

190
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:31,220
In the end, there was…

191
00:08:33,177 --> 00:08:35,099
We wanted quick attacks to be fast and powerful.

192
00:08:35,119 --> 00:08:37,242
We wanted you to feel like a samurai when you did them.

193
00:08:37,802 --> 00:08:41,026
It took lots of little fixes to help keep the heart

194
00:08:41,106 --> 00:08:43,589
of this quick and powerful attack intact

195
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:45,591
while damping it to over-effectiveness.

196
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:48,715
The first thing that we added

197
00:08:48,735 --> 00:08:50,977
that actually made you feel skillful

198
00:08:51,318 --> 00:08:52,459
wasn't the quick attack.

199
00:08:52,619 --> 00:08:53,901
It was a timing-based parry.

200
00:08:54,522 --> 00:08:59,663
delaying your block until just before an enemy attack lands to get a better result. Most NPC

201
00:08:59,703 --> 00:09:03,225
attacks are blockable, especially in the early parts of the game. It's easy to block attacks,

202
00:09:03,245 --> 00:09:06,166
you just hold L1 and you're safe. You'll just stand there and you'll block attacks.

203
00:09:06,686 --> 00:09:10,847
But this simple and safe strategy doesn't provide any counterattacking opportunities.

204
00:09:11,688 --> 00:09:15,109
With parries though, the enemy is spun past you.

205
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:20,847
We even interrupted any windups as buddies had started

206
00:09:20,867 --> 00:09:22,508
to give you a clean chance to counter attack.

207
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:23,349
And this felt great.

208
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:25,010
Player connection was excellent.

209
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,711
You felt like you actually parried the blow.

210
00:09:26,831 --> 00:09:27,872
And remember, that's our goal.

211
00:09:28,312 --> 00:09:29,833
Our goal is to make the controller disappear,

212
00:09:29,873 --> 00:09:31,775
to make the player feel like they actually are swinging

213
00:09:31,795 --> 00:09:32,976
the sword or parried the strike,

214
00:09:33,636 --> 00:09:36,218
not just press buttons to make those actions appear.

215
00:09:37,479 --> 00:09:39,840
Skill-based parries were our first real immersive success.

216
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,421
It felt dangerous to delay your block

217
00:09:41,561 --> 00:09:42,622
and skillful to pull it off.

218
00:09:43,264 --> 00:09:48,329
But there was an exploit with this. There was a cheese opportunity. You could flutter the block

219
00:09:48,369 --> 00:09:53,014
button, press block very quickly, and parry every single attack. You should press the block button

220
00:09:53,034 --> 00:09:59,039
fast enough that you were guaranteed to hit the wind-up of an enemy attack. So while we loved

221
00:09:59,059 --> 00:10:04,264
the parrying mechanism, when it worked there was a spark of magic. Many players couldn't leave the

222
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:05,105
cheese alone.

223
00:10:06,309 --> 00:10:08,171
Once they discovered this exploit,

224
00:10:08,512 --> 00:10:11,075
they couldn't stop themselves from using it,

225
00:10:11,616 --> 00:10:12,817
even though they weren't happy.

226
00:10:13,218 --> 00:10:14,600
And this was an internal play test.

227
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,382
These are professional game developers.

228
00:10:16,462 --> 00:10:17,844
They knew that this was a bug.

229
00:10:17,864 --> 00:10:19,947
They knew that this was an exploit.

230
00:10:20,327 --> 00:10:21,289
They knew we would fix it.

231
00:10:21,309 --> 00:10:22,190
They knew they weren't happy.

232
00:10:25,412 --> 00:10:28,794
We eventually found a way to keep the core magic of parries intact

233
00:10:28,814 --> 00:10:31,676
while eliminating the exploit, and there's a tech note about this,

234
00:10:31,716 --> 00:10:33,998
but to simplify, we track an effective block time

235
00:10:34,018 --> 00:10:35,199
that ignores button mashing,

236
00:10:35,619 --> 00:10:38,441
and parries end up being pretty foundational to Ghost Melee combat.

237
00:10:39,462 --> 00:10:42,904
Here's a general game design rule that follows from these two examples,

238
00:10:43,124 --> 00:10:44,325
and many others like them.

239
00:10:44,805 --> 00:10:46,767
You might think of this as the hide-the-cheese rule.

240
00:10:47,487 --> 00:10:49,249
Most players will play the game

241
00:10:49,369 --> 00:10:52,591
in what they perceive as the most effective way to make progress,

242
00:10:53,191 --> 00:10:54,873
even if that leads to them having less fun.

243
00:10:55,497 --> 00:10:59,101
Even if they know that playing the game that way isn't fun,

244
00:10:59,502 --> 00:11:02,004
they'll still play it the way they think is most effective,

245
00:11:02,104 --> 00:11:03,025
and they won't be happy.

246
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:05,394
they kind of have two choices, right?

247
00:11:05,495 --> 00:11:10,016
Either they'll play the game in the way that is effective

248
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:13,117
but not fun and resent you for making a not fun game,

249
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:17,458
or they'll play the game in the not effective but fun way

250
00:11:18,358 --> 00:11:20,279
and resent you for making them into saps.

251
00:11:20,539 --> 00:11:23,119
So make sure that the way the players feel

252
00:11:23,179 --> 00:11:24,680
is the most effective way to play the game

253
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,040
is also the most enjoyable way to play the game.

254
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,881
Otherwise you're gonna get yourself in trouble.

255
00:11:30,677 --> 00:11:35,561
So it was pretty clear from our testing with players that varied play styles were the key

256
00:11:35,581 --> 00:11:39,905
to enjoying the game more. If players who mixed up the way they played the game had more fun and

257
00:11:39,925 --> 00:11:44,749
they scored the game higher. If they used all of Jhin's abilities, melee, ranged combat, ghost tools,

258
00:11:44,869 --> 00:11:49,994
stealth, they consistently reported higher scores. We wanted to nudge more players into varied

259
00:11:50,034 --> 00:11:50,294
experience.

260
00:11:51,745 --> 00:11:56,548
more enjoyment. And it did turn out this way, but it might not have, right?

261
00:11:56,588 --> 00:12:00,090
The causality arrow could have pointed the other direction. It was plausible in

262
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:04,753
early tests that what we were seeing was that players who were enjoying the game

263
00:12:04,893 --> 00:12:09,116
were trying out more parts of it rather than the other way around. But in fact,

264
00:12:09,156 --> 00:12:13,419
this did work, that as we encouraged players to mix stuff up, our scores went

265
00:12:13,479 --> 00:12:17,941
up. People had more fun. So there are two basic ways to

266
00:12:18,814 --> 00:12:23,356
a varied play experience. You can vary the situations the player finds themselves in,

267
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:27,799
so that they're using the same abilities in different contexts, or you can provide lots

268
00:12:27,859 --> 00:12:32,162
of options for player engagement, in hopes that they'll use different abilities in the same context.

269
00:12:32,182 --> 00:12:35,824
Or, most likely, you'll provide both, with a rich set of player verbs and a similarly rich

270
00:12:35,864 --> 00:12:41,428
set of game-provided experiences. Let's start with the player's ability set, providing variety

271
00:12:42,108 --> 00:12:45,410
by giving players the ability to do different things.

272
00:12:46,329 --> 00:12:52,422
Well, providing a rich verb set that gives players agency on how to interact with the game's challenges is a great thing.

273
00:12:53,492 --> 00:12:59,075
letting the players choose which verbs to use and how and when adds agency, and that's great. But

274
00:12:59,435 --> 00:13:04,739
the problem with player agency is that players tend to not use it the way you want them to.

275
00:13:05,219 --> 00:13:08,661
In particular, players tend to stick with the strategy that they find that works,

276
00:13:08,781 --> 00:13:12,944
the first strategy they find that works. The psychological term for this is satisficing.

277
00:13:13,264 --> 00:13:16,606
Their approach works, so why experiment with stuff that mostly doesn't work?

278
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:20,149
That's especially true in a game like Ghost where you're under pressure the whole time.

279
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:25,374
You don't have safe spaces to experiment. The only place to try new combat techniques is inside of

280
00:13:25,414 --> 00:13:31,040
combat, so you stick with what you have. So generally Ghost players needed a nudge to try new things.

281
00:13:31,827 --> 00:13:35,628
There are two main ways to nudge players.

282
00:13:36,428 --> 00:13:38,188
You can discourage them from the strategies

283
00:13:38,228 --> 00:13:39,249
you think they're overusing,

284
00:13:39,749 --> 00:13:41,790
or you can encourage them to try new strategies,

285
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:43,130
the ones you think they're underusing.

286
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:46,071
So you might try to discourage an overused attack

287
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,812
by introducing an enemy who blocks those attacks perfectly,

288
00:13:48,892 --> 00:13:50,972
but is vulnerable to the attack you'd like to see more of.

289
00:13:51,552 --> 00:13:52,553
That's frustrating.

290
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:54,273
This sort of blocking key design

291
00:13:54,313 --> 00:13:56,074
breaks the immersion we were trying to create.

292
00:13:56,214 --> 00:13:57,774
Players can tell that they're playing a game

293
00:13:58,034 --> 00:13:59,195
and they don't like it so much.

294
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:01,615
Similarly, you could.

295
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:08,711
or adding a timeout, or having its effectiveness degrade over time or when overused.

296
00:14:08,731 --> 00:14:13,252
But why would you do this? Players were using the abilities they thought were effective and enjoyable.

297
00:14:13,672 --> 00:14:18,074
Why take that away from them by making those abilities less enjoyable and less effective?

298
00:14:18,634 --> 00:14:24,136
So we focused instead on encouraging use of underused abilities, rather than discouraging use of overused ones.

299
00:14:24,536 --> 00:14:27,437
We focused on carrots instead of sticks, if you want to think of it that way.

300
00:14:28,682 --> 00:14:30,642
In our early tests of Ghost of Tsushima, for instance,

301
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:32,562
we did not see varied ability use.

302
00:14:33,483 --> 00:14:35,843
In our play tests, we track every attack launched by the player.

303
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:39,364
And early on, player attacks were overwhelmingly light attacks,

304
00:14:40,104 --> 00:14:43,144
quick attacks, like 90-something percent for many players.

305
00:14:43,664 --> 00:14:46,045
Players who didn't just use quick attacks, though,

306
00:14:46,105 --> 00:14:48,305
who mixed up their play styles, scored the game higher.

307
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:49,085
They had more fun.

308
00:14:49,706 --> 00:14:52,206
We wanted to nudge more players into that varied play style.

309
00:14:52,386 --> 00:14:54,627
Our goal was to make heavy attacks more appealing

310
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,507
instead of just discouraging light attacks.

311
00:14:57,527 --> 00:14:57,747
First...

312
00:14:58,908 --> 00:15:01,789
We had to make sure that the value statement for heavy attacks was clear.

313
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:04,410
What is the point of using a heavy attack?

314
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:06,491
As a player, why do I do it?

315
00:15:06,511 --> 00:15:09,031
In Ghost, the reason you use heavy attacks for the most part

316
00:15:09,132 --> 00:15:10,692
is that they let you blast through blocks.

317
00:15:11,332 --> 00:15:13,173
For players who want a direct approach,

318
00:15:13,393 --> 00:15:16,214
who want to just walk up to somebody who's blocking their attacks

319
00:15:16,314 --> 00:15:19,075
and knock down the block and then hit them with their sword,

320
00:15:19,715 --> 00:15:21,316
and that describes a lot of players,

321
00:15:21,896 --> 00:15:24,697
this is pretty appealing, the ability to have a direct path through a block.

322
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,358
And this was mostly a communication problem.

323
00:15:29,436 --> 00:15:32,658
we could know that heavy attacks were breaking through blocks.

324
00:15:32,758 --> 00:15:36,619
In fact, we tried an approach where it only took a single heavy attack to break an NPC's block,

325
00:15:37,119 --> 00:15:38,420
but this felt pretty mechanical.

326
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:44,343
We decided we needed to require multiple heavy attacks to break through a block.

327
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:49,065
But communicating that the player was making progress during this was a challenge.

328
00:15:49,585 --> 00:15:53,006
And unfortunately, our best solution was adding UI to the screen,

329
00:15:53,046 --> 00:15:55,808
which we didn't really want to do since we were trying to minimize UI.

330
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:58,889
We added a meter that showed remaining block points,

331
00:15:59,509 --> 00:16:00,910
but that's not its real purpose.

332
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:03,891
The real purpose of the block meter isn't to show how many block points are left.

333
00:16:04,412 --> 00:16:06,813
It's to flash when you hit the guy with a heavy attack.

334
00:16:07,793 --> 00:16:11,775
In effect, it's just a signaling mechanism to say the thing you just did was a good thing

335
00:16:11,895 --> 00:16:12,755
and it had an effect.

336
00:16:14,168 --> 00:16:17,431
You can tell how many black points someone has left, but that's not really the point.

337
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:24,879
And in the end, this helped. This was what we needed to do. It did help people understand why

338
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:29,264
they're using a heavy attack, and so we were willing to accept the compromise and actually

339
00:16:29,304 --> 00:16:31,986
add some more UI to a game that we really didn't want to have UI in.

340
00:16:33,414 --> 00:16:36,436
Next, we improved the effectiveness of heavy attacks.

341
00:16:36,576 --> 00:16:38,718
We made the attacks faster to make them easier to use.

342
00:16:39,078 --> 00:16:40,879
We increased the amount of block damage they did

343
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:42,760
to make the directed path more appealing.

344
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,061
And these are easy changes

345
00:16:44,081 --> 00:16:45,562
because they both make the game more grounded.

346
00:16:46,142 --> 00:16:48,744
At the end, when we ship our light attack,

347
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:52,346
our quick attack usage was under 65% of all player attacks

348
00:16:52,786 --> 00:16:54,567
with heavy attacks a little over 20%.

349
00:16:54,807 --> 00:16:56,608
The rest of it, it's a smattering of super attacks,

350
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:58,309
ghost stamped attacks, standoffs, and so on.

351
00:16:58,329 --> 00:16:59,270
And we were okay with that.

352
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,571
That was an easy, that was pretty good mix.

353
00:17:02,328 --> 00:17:05,450
Similarly, it was a challenge to get players to use ghost tools.

354
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:10,932
And this was a problem, since ghost tools were a big part of the story we were telling,

355
00:17:11,432 --> 00:17:14,373
a story that Jin Sakai had to adopt underhanded techniques to win.

356
00:17:15,233 --> 00:17:18,235
Players were comfortable moving through the game with their conventional tools,

357
00:17:18,475 --> 00:17:20,215
like katana attacks in ranged combat.

358
00:17:20,917 --> 00:17:23,099
Luckily, most players were happy to use assassination,

359
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,581
so we weren't completely out of luck on underhanded tactics.

360
00:17:26,601 --> 00:17:28,822
But again, players that did use ghost tools

361
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:29,863
scored the game higher.

362
00:17:30,123 --> 00:17:32,185
So we wanted to nudge the players in that direction.

363
00:17:33,245 --> 00:17:34,446
Again, we could have nerfed

364
00:17:34,646 --> 00:17:36,167
all the conventional player abilities,

365
00:17:36,487 --> 00:17:37,788
but players were enjoying them

366
00:17:37,828 --> 00:17:38,929
and we didn't want to ruin that.

367
00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:40,950
We could have added lock and key designs,

368
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:43,332
NPCs that were only vulnerable to a particular ghost tool,

369
00:17:43,372 --> 00:17:45,073
but that also seemed like a bad direction.

370
00:17:45,533 --> 00:17:47,955
So we focused on making ghost tools more appealing.

371
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,961
The most important changes were to make the tools easier to use.

372
00:17:52,101 --> 00:17:54,362
We started with Kunai, the throwing daggers in Ghost,

373
00:17:54,462 --> 00:17:56,223
because those were the most popular tool.

374
00:17:58,164 --> 00:18:02,546
The most important change we made was to have the player start

375
00:18:02,566 --> 00:18:04,887
by throwing multiple daggers, not a single dagger.

376
00:18:05,528 --> 00:18:08,329
Given the constraints in our aiming model, that it had to be fast,

377
00:18:08,529 --> 00:18:09,990
that you were using a joystick,

378
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,091
that daggers had a reasonably long range,

379
00:18:12,551 --> 00:18:14,512
we knew there would be some imprecision in the aiming,

380
00:18:14,572 --> 00:18:17,013
that players wouldn't be able to perfectly snipe a target.

381
00:18:17,553 --> 00:18:21,918
So we leaned into that. By throwing three daggers, we tripled the chance that you'd hit the target

382
00:18:21,938 --> 00:18:25,903
you were meant to hit. We do give you feedback on which target we thought you aimed at. It's the

383
00:18:25,943 --> 00:18:31,129
middle one of the three. But players didn't care that we misinterpreted their input. They only

384
00:18:31,169 --> 00:18:35,614
cared that the target they wanted to get hit actually got hit. There's a tech note about this.

385
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:40,393
The second big change was to lock you into one ghost tool at a time.

386
00:18:40,973 --> 00:18:44,176
Previously, we thought that allowing you simultaneous access to all of your ghost

387
00:18:44,196 --> 00:18:47,559
tools would increase usage. And there were people who passionately

388
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:50,902
believed that they wanted to be able to instantly throw a smoke bomb or

389
00:18:50,942 --> 00:18:56,827
a dagger or a sticky bomb. The last version of this simultaneous input

390
00:18:56,847 --> 00:19:00,350
model was corded. You would hold R1 and then you would press a face button with

391
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:03,113
R1 down. So R1 plus X would throw daggers.

392
00:19:03,955 --> 00:19:07,979
But we weren't seeing people use ghost tools and we knew we needed to change stuff.

393
00:19:08,299 --> 00:19:11,462
So we switched. We switched to a one ghost tool at a time model,

394
00:19:11,883 --> 00:19:14,585
where you only have one ghost tool assigned to R1 at a time.

395
00:19:14,986 --> 00:19:16,587
Pressing R1 will fire that ghost tool.

396
00:19:16,727 --> 00:19:19,690
It's easy to switch, but fundamentally you only have one thing at a time.

397
00:19:20,787 --> 00:19:25,067
And somewhat counterintuitively, this created immediate wins.

398
00:19:25,147 --> 00:19:28,948
Like immediately we saw 30 to 40% more use of ghost tools.

399
00:19:29,588 --> 00:19:30,929
And this is sort of weird, right?

400
00:19:31,049 --> 00:19:34,449
That like we've made it harder in some sense to use ghost tools

401
00:19:34,509 --> 00:19:36,770
by making you assign the one you want, then use it.

402
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,150
And yet the usage went up.

403
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:40,770
So why did this happen?

404
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:43,731
Well, you know, if you look at what we've talked about earlier

405
00:19:43,771 --> 00:19:45,171
in this talk, it's pretty obvious why.

406
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:48,992
We had added too much cognitive load to the players, right?

407
00:19:49,312 --> 00:19:49,512
It was...

408
00:19:50,132 --> 00:19:55,055
there were too many things for them to think about. There were too many options for them to consider

409
00:19:55,075 --> 00:20:00,818
and too many controls they could hit. They were under a lot of pressure and so they reverted back

410
00:20:00,838 --> 00:20:03,959
to doing the things they could count on. They hit square and triangle and made it through encounters

411
00:20:03,999 --> 00:20:08,421
that way. By simplifying it down, by reducing the cognitive load, they were able to think quicker

412
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:12,363
and they could keep up with the game and they could hit R1 and fire the kunai when they wanted to.

413
00:20:12,383 --> 00:20:13,564
The third

414
00:20:16,539 --> 00:20:24,428
more subtle. It's to make sure that the ammo model works out. We restrict your use of ghost tools

415
00:20:24,668 --> 00:20:30,475
through ammo. And the thing about ammo limited models is that people will only use them if they

416
00:20:30,515 --> 00:20:32,977
feel confident that more ammo is easily accessible.

417
00:20:33,538 --> 00:20:36,481
that if they feel like they might run out of ammo,

418
00:20:36,521 --> 00:20:37,201
they'll just hoard it.

419
00:20:37,922 --> 00:20:39,143
So first we had to make sure

420
00:20:39,183 --> 00:20:40,924
there was lots of ammo in the world, which we did.

421
00:20:41,525 --> 00:20:43,286
And then we had to play some sneaky games.

422
00:20:43,747 --> 00:20:47,590
So in Ghost, if you're low on a particular kind of ammo,

423
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:50,172
you're more likely to get that in an ammo drop.

424
00:20:50,933 --> 00:20:52,534
We'll lean on the dice rolls a little bit.

425
00:20:53,015 --> 00:20:57,076
But, and this is important, even if you're full of kunai,

426
00:20:57,116 --> 00:20:59,557
we will still drop kunai for you occasionally.

427
00:21:00,137 --> 00:21:03,038
And that's important, because if we stop dropping kunai,

428
00:21:03,399 --> 00:21:05,659
players will conclude there's not a lot of kunai in the world,

429
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:06,820
and they'll stop using them.

430
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,021
So even when you're full, you'll still get stuff

431
00:21:11,141 --> 00:21:12,922
so that you think there's lots of it in the world.

432
00:21:13,402 --> 00:21:15,943
And this all works out, and we end up driving ghost tool usage

433
00:21:16,003 --> 00:21:18,404
up to being like 5% of the attacks, and that's not bad.

434
00:21:19,568 --> 00:21:22,550
So what's my takeaway from these two case studies?

435
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:26,033
Well, first, if you're trying to get a player

436
00:21:26,053 --> 00:21:28,455
to use some ability, don't try to force it.

437
00:21:28,795 --> 00:21:30,376
Don't make them use it.

438
00:21:30,937 --> 00:21:33,118
Don't create enemies that are only vulnerable

439
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:33,959
to the new ability.

440
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:37,161
Especially don't hamstring the player's other abilities

441
00:21:37,181 --> 00:21:38,422
to get them to use the new one.

442
00:21:38,863 --> 00:21:41,685
Instead, work to make the new one more appealing.

443
00:21:42,165 --> 00:21:43,927
Make the value proposition obvious.

444
00:21:44,347 --> 00:21:46,128
Be sure players understand the reasons

445
00:21:46,148 --> 00:21:47,770
why the new ability would be useful.

446
00:21:48,365 --> 00:21:51,507
Make sure the ability is easy to use and obviously effective.

447
00:21:52,548 --> 00:21:56,452
If you must, give players an extra reward for using new abilities,

448
00:21:56,492 --> 00:21:57,552
like an XP bonus.

449
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:00,155
But don't hit players with a stick.

450
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:02,497
They don't like that.

451
00:22:02,897 --> 00:22:04,198
Hand them a carrot instead.

452
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,742
Let's switch to the other way of creating variety,

453
00:22:09,863 --> 00:22:12,345
having the game present new situations for the player to deal with.

454
00:22:13,243 --> 00:22:16,286
And in particular, let's rotate back to one of the first issues we talked about,

455
00:22:16,406 --> 00:22:17,907
the limits of human reaction speed.

456
00:22:18,588 --> 00:22:21,030
Reading situations and reacting quickly and accurately

457
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:23,492
is a core part of the skill challenge Ghost presents for players,

458
00:22:23,872 --> 00:22:25,554
but player reaction speeds aren't constant.

459
00:22:25,574 --> 00:22:26,695
They depend on a lot of things.

460
00:22:27,956 --> 00:22:30,158
For a simple stimulus and a simple response,

461
00:22:30,918 --> 00:22:33,521
you can expect a quick reaction time.

462
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:36,303
Think of a line of sprinters all in their starting blocks

463
00:22:36,343 --> 00:22:37,904
waiting for a starter's pistol to go off.

464
00:22:38,205 --> 00:22:40,126
It's a simple stimulus and a simple response.

465
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:44,532
Adding more complicated stimuli slows down reaction times.

466
00:22:44,893 --> 00:22:47,735
So watching for attacks from multiple NPCs,

467
00:22:47,795 --> 00:22:50,136
unsure which of them is going to attack will slow you down.

468
00:22:50,697 --> 00:22:52,658
Or needing to look at different cues,

469
00:22:52,698 --> 00:22:55,160
different wind-ups for different attacks from a single NPC,

470
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,221
that will slow you down.

471
00:22:56,781 --> 00:22:58,642
As the complexity of the situation goes up,

472
00:22:58,862 --> 00:23:00,344
player response times get longer.

473
00:23:01,504 --> 00:23:03,866
The same is true for complexity in player abilities.

474
00:23:04,186 --> 00:23:07,088
As the player considers more options, their reaction times slow down.

475
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:10,491
Those sprinters in their blocks only have one option to start running,

476
00:23:10,531 --> 00:23:11,432
but the player has many.

477
00:23:11,652 --> 00:23:14,154
Block, dodge, light attack, heavy attack, super attack,

478
00:23:14,194 --> 00:23:17,316
jump attack, ghost tools, all kinds of stuff, right?

479
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:20,379
Remember that quick and accurate reaction to this situation

480
00:23:20,419 --> 00:23:21,720
was one of our core skill tests.

481
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,262
When it works well, when we're dancing at the edge

482
00:23:24,282 --> 00:23:26,703
of what the player can do, then success is rewarding.

483
00:23:27,424 --> 00:23:29,706
If we undershoot, if we don't provide enough complexity,

484
00:23:29,726 --> 00:23:31,787
then players react too quick, find the game too easy,

485
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:32,848
and find exploits.

486
00:23:33,429 --> 00:23:35,390
If we overshoot, we have too much complexity,

487
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:37,492
then players are frustrated and feel unskilled.

488
00:23:38,408 --> 00:23:40,589
And so finding the right balance is important.

489
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:42,931
We have to ladle in the right amount of complexity

490
00:23:43,331 --> 00:23:45,513
so that it feels challenging and fair,

491
00:23:46,414 --> 00:23:48,095
but is a challenge the players can overcome.

492
00:23:48,855 --> 00:23:51,277
Let's look at one way in which we ladled in more complexity

493
00:23:51,297 --> 00:23:52,718
to create a more enjoyable challenge.

494
00:23:53,939 --> 00:23:54,980
And it's archers.

495
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,622
We couldn't very well make a game about an army of Mongols

496
00:23:57,662 --> 00:23:58,662
without including archers.

497
00:24:01,442 --> 00:24:03,766
Our early integration of archers was problematic,

498
00:24:04,106 --> 00:24:06,790
especially in the intersection of range combat and melee combat,

499
00:24:07,131 --> 00:24:10,275
which is to say, what happens when you have archers firing into a melee fight?

500
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:13,299
Or what happens when you get into a fight with archers around?

501
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,461
Well, you have some options.

502
00:24:15,521 --> 00:24:17,022
You could let archers fire into fights,

503
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:19,304
and we tried this, and it was not fun.

504
00:24:19,764 --> 00:24:21,566
You're in the middle of a high-intensity sword fight,

505
00:24:21,686 --> 00:24:22,706
and you've got your hands full

506
00:24:22,787 --> 00:24:24,548
dealing with people with swords and spears,

507
00:24:25,008 --> 00:24:27,110
and you keep getting shot from offscreen by archers.

508
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:28,591
So what do you do as a player?

509
00:24:29,031 --> 00:24:30,653
Well, you start every single encounter

510
00:24:30,693 --> 00:24:32,734
by locating and eliminating all of the archers.

511
00:24:32,955 --> 00:24:35,016
You stealth your way around and kill them all.

512
00:24:35,817 --> 00:24:37,938
And this forces you into a single repetitive pattern

513
00:24:37,978 --> 00:24:40,140
in every encounter, which is not what we were after.

514
00:24:40,941 --> 00:24:43,843
Or you can decide that archers don't fire into melee scrums.

515
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:44,843
And we tried this.

516
00:24:45,364 --> 00:24:46,985
It was better, but still not fun.

517
00:24:47,645 --> 00:24:48,966
Once you got into a sword fight,

518
00:24:49,306 --> 00:24:52,468
the archers that were nearby no longer had an effective footprint.

519
00:24:52,548 --> 00:24:53,928
They didn't have any effect on the fight.

520
00:24:54,169 --> 00:24:58,011
You could just ignore them until you killed the last enemy, melee enemy.

521
00:24:58,591 --> 00:25:00,032
At which point the archers popped up.

522
00:25:00,192 --> 00:25:01,753
Now, if you remember, they were around.

523
00:25:01,793 --> 00:25:02,693
This wasn't a surprise.

524
00:25:03,074 --> 00:25:06,616
But pretty often you'd forgotten there were archers around during your melee fight.

525
00:25:06,676 --> 00:25:09,757
And your first reminder of this was getting shot with an arrow.

526
00:25:10,518 --> 00:25:16,201
So neither of these two solutions are awesome. Neither shooting into fights or not shooting

527
00:25:16,221 --> 00:25:19,103
into fights, neither of these worked very well. So we...

528
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,521
But we kind of needed to have archers nearby, right?

529
00:25:24,601 --> 00:25:27,382
And we needed to have them influence fights.

530
00:25:28,763 --> 00:25:30,043
Because of the constraints we're under,

531
00:25:30,664 --> 00:25:33,585
we don't have very many ways to mix stuff up, right?

532
00:25:33,625 --> 00:25:34,585
We don't have monsters.

533
00:25:35,025 --> 00:25:35,885
We don't have magic.

534
00:25:36,226 --> 00:25:37,546
So archers have to play a role.

535
00:25:38,046 --> 00:25:42,228
A melee fight with archers has to feel different than a fight without archers.

536
00:25:43,338 --> 00:25:44,239
So what's our solution?

537
00:25:44,619 --> 00:25:46,781
Our solution was to turn archers into an audio cue

538
00:25:46,821 --> 00:25:47,801
instead of a visual one.

539
00:25:48,222 --> 00:25:49,963
When archers are about to fire, they yell,

540
00:25:50,103 --> 00:25:53,145
doosh, that's duck in Mongolian, by the way.

541
00:25:53,846 --> 00:25:55,387
Anyhow, when the archers yelled doosh,

542
00:25:55,547 --> 00:25:57,789
you'll see the other Mongols duck, which amplifies the cue.

543
00:25:58,349 --> 00:25:59,470
And players, believe it or not,

544
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:01,812
were quick to accept this in-game fiction.

545
00:26:02,573 --> 00:26:03,814
You would think that maybe they'd say,

546
00:26:03,834 --> 00:26:04,794
this doesn't seem right,

547
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:06,876
but in fact, they're happy to take that.

548
00:26:07,256 --> 00:26:08,377
There's a tech note about this.

549
00:26:09,658 --> 00:26:10,339
As a player,

550
00:26:13,686 --> 00:26:16,892
you won't get hit with the arrow. Direction doesn't matter. You don't have to track where

551
00:26:16,932 --> 00:26:20,218
the archers are. If you hear a dosh, you can dodge and you're not going to get hit.

552
00:26:20,914 --> 00:26:23,536
And this gives you one more thing to juggle during a fight.

553
00:26:24,217 --> 00:26:26,939
In addition to watching all the nearby Mongols for visual cues,

554
00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:29,721
you need to listen for the audio cues for incoming arrows.

555
00:26:30,662 --> 00:26:33,684
And more cues means more complexity, means slower player reactions,

556
00:26:33,744 --> 00:26:35,786
which means a more challenging and rewarding fight.

557
00:26:36,426 --> 00:26:38,828
And it means that a fight with archers nearby

558
00:26:38,848 --> 00:26:41,991
has this added element that a fight without archers doesn't have,

559
00:26:42,471 --> 00:26:44,673
giving us another way to vary the player experience.

560
00:26:45,634 --> 00:26:47,675
So what's the takeaway here?

561
00:26:48,417 --> 00:26:53,340
Well, there are lots of other ways we mix things up, and some work better than others.

562
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:56,842
So we added falcons to make stealth more of a challenge, or we created different mixes

563
00:26:56,882 --> 00:27:01,145
of enemy archetypes, or we created enemy archetypes that had really different kinds of attacks.

564
00:27:01,885 --> 00:27:06,047
Or we had you fight in areas where your mobility was more limited, or we had you fight alongside

565
00:27:06,127 --> 00:27:10,710
allies. In a lot of ways, it's easier to create a varied play experience through varied content,

566
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:11,931
because players can't avoid it.

567
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:15,159
They can choose not to use the abilities you provide them,

568
00:27:15,639 --> 00:27:19,441
but the encounters you place them in, they can't avoid.

569
00:27:20,101 --> 00:27:23,682
It's also a great lever to nudge players into mixing up their play styles in natural ways.

570
00:27:24,182 --> 00:27:27,523
A well-designed encounter can nudge the player who mostly engages in melee fights

571
00:27:27,623 --> 00:27:29,123
into getting into an archery battle.

572
00:27:29,857 --> 00:27:34,839
or can nudge players who really like to fight things straight up to use stealth occasionally.

573
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:43,984
So externally changing the situation is a great way to provide variety.

574
00:27:44,965 --> 00:27:46,426
So let's talk about progression.

575
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:50,605
The samurai fantasy is about discipline and hard work leading to mastery.

576
00:27:50,945 --> 00:27:51,726
That's progression.

577
00:27:52,226 --> 00:27:54,228
And that's a journey we wanted the player to go on, too.

578
00:27:54,909 --> 00:27:57,551
One of the convenient things about Ghost for us as game developers

579
00:27:57,591 --> 00:28:00,293
was how tightly the player's journey matched Jin's journey.

580
00:28:01,034 --> 00:28:04,536
In particular, the player gets better at playing the game with practice.

581
00:28:04,737 --> 00:28:07,619
They're more precise with the controller, their timing gets better,

582
00:28:07,659 --> 00:28:09,861
their decision-making becomes faster and more accurate.

583
00:28:10,443 --> 00:28:12,464
Having more complexity slows players down,

584
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:15,325
so there's a temporary setback whenever we add a new concept,

585
00:28:15,765 --> 00:28:18,266
but their decision space getting more complicated,

586
00:28:19,366 --> 00:28:22,067
their decisions getting slower, that improves with practice.

587
00:28:22,747 --> 00:28:25,288
Responses migrate from the slow parts of players' brains

588
00:28:25,308 --> 00:28:26,108
to the fast parts.

589
00:28:26,548 --> 00:28:29,269
They do less thinking, they react instinctively,

590
00:28:29,629 --> 00:28:31,010
they get better at playing the game.

591
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:33,890
And the player's knowledge increases as well.

592
00:28:34,031 --> 00:28:35,851
They get smarter, they learn new enemy types,

593
00:28:35,871 --> 00:28:37,191
they learn or invent new techniques,

594
00:28:37,271 --> 00:28:39,452
they spot opportunities they would have missed early on.

595
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:45,282
Becoming more skilled, becoming more knowledgeable, both of these mirror Jhin's journey in the game,

596
00:28:45,722 --> 00:28:50,583
and that was an important consideration for us. And they're both part of progression. Now, when

597
00:28:50,623 --> 00:28:54,245
you saw a slide about progression, you probably thought we were going to talk about how the Jhin

598
00:28:54,265 --> 00:28:58,826
character learns new abilities or gets new gear. And that's important, but it's only one leg of

599
00:28:58,886 --> 00:29:02,607
the progression tripod. Here's how I propose thinking about progression.

600
00:29:03,207 --> 00:29:06,951
It's not just character progression, your character's gaining new abilities or gear.

601
00:29:07,591 --> 00:29:11,715
That's an important part of the overall progression model, but so is players getting

602
00:29:11,755 --> 00:29:15,438
better at playing the game. And so is players getting smarter about how they play the game,

603
00:29:15,498 --> 00:29:16,860
about players' knowledge increasing.

604
00:29:18,064 --> 00:29:20,704
We thought about each of these separately for Ghost.

605
00:29:21,085 --> 00:29:23,525
We wanted each to play a distinct role in the player's journey

606
00:29:23,545 --> 00:29:25,206
through what turned out to be a pretty long game.

607
00:29:25,746 --> 00:29:27,207
The balance for your game will be different.

608
00:29:27,247 --> 00:29:29,508
The weight you assign to each of the three areas will be different

609
00:29:29,528 --> 00:29:30,628
than it was for us in Ghost.

610
00:29:31,048 --> 00:29:33,309
But thinking about them as distinct forms of progression

611
00:29:33,409 --> 00:29:35,169
will lead to a richer player experience.

612
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:37,270
And here's the thing about progression.

613
00:29:37,856 --> 00:29:40,077
Players are reluctant to try new things.

614
00:29:40,397 --> 00:29:42,998
Not all players, but many players, maybe even most players.

615
00:29:43,518 --> 00:29:45,358
So if you introduce a new player ability

616
00:29:45,378 --> 00:29:46,279
partway through your game,

617
00:29:46,339 --> 00:29:48,259
and let players decide whether to use it or not,

618
00:29:48,639 --> 00:29:49,159
many won't.

619
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:50,780
Here's the key.

620
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,961
Make the first experience awesome.

621
00:29:53,381 --> 00:29:55,201
The first time players use a new ability,

622
00:29:55,601 --> 00:29:56,762
it should be easy to pull off,

623
00:29:57,062 --> 00:29:59,443
obviously effective, and emotionally rewarding.

624
00:29:59,903 --> 00:30:02,423
If it is, they'll use it again, and you're in good shape.

625
00:30:02,583 --> 00:30:04,404
If it isn't, they'll go back to what they know.

626
00:30:05,458 --> 00:30:09,502
Be careful that your efforts to create interesting progression for an ability

627
00:30:09,662 --> 00:30:12,164
don't ruin the player's first impression of that ability.

628
00:30:12,725 --> 00:30:14,847
It's easy to decide when you're working on progression

629
00:30:14,947 --> 00:30:16,889
that what you need to do is weaken the first ability,

630
00:30:17,249 --> 00:30:18,350
first version of the ability,

631
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:20,412
so that the player has a reason to upgrade it.

632
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:21,273
Don't do this.

633
00:30:21,613 --> 00:30:23,875
If the first version of your ability doesn't grab the player,

634
00:30:24,275 --> 00:30:25,517
the second version won't matter.

635
00:30:26,638 --> 00:30:27,659
And in a related note,

636
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:29,901
be sure to front load your best ideas in your game.

637
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:30,822
Don't save.

638
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:37,512
of the game. The most important 15 minutes of your game is the first 15 minutes. The most important

639
00:30:37,532 --> 00:30:42,373
hour of your game is the first hour. If those two things aren't great, if the first 15 minutes

640
00:30:42,393 --> 00:30:47,515
and the first hour aren't great, nothing else matters. Front load your best ideas. If the

641
00:30:47,555 --> 00:30:53,017
beginning of the game isn't great, no one will make it to the end. Let's look at an example about

642
00:30:53,357 --> 00:30:55,198
making the first impression a strong one.

643
00:30:55,834 --> 00:30:59,837
In the evolution of Ghost Melee Combat, one of the most important things we added was stances.

644
00:31:00,378 --> 00:31:04,080
The stances weren't there to begin with. We added them midway through the development of the game,

645
00:31:04,781 --> 00:31:08,604
in a series of incremental steps, actually, because we were frightened of adding more

646
00:31:08,644 --> 00:31:11,126
complexity to the game, which was already too complicated.

647
00:31:12,058 --> 00:31:14,540
Obviously stances do make the game more complicated for the player.

648
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,740
There's a whole new set of things for players to worry about.

649
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:19,302
More options to deal with in every situation.

650
00:31:19,702 --> 00:31:21,703
And we were worried that players would be overloaded.

651
00:31:22,223 --> 00:31:23,263
Well, we weren't wrong.

652
00:31:23,483 --> 00:31:25,704
The extra burden of stances did slow players down.

653
00:31:25,784 --> 00:31:26,845
Players were overwhelmed.

654
00:31:27,365 --> 00:31:28,725
And the first times we tested this,

655
00:31:28,745 --> 00:31:30,646
the take up was lower than we wanted it to be.

656
00:31:31,126 --> 00:31:33,147
But players really liked the idea of stances.

657
00:31:33,187 --> 00:31:34,988
They just felt clumsy trying to use them.

658
00:31:35,288 --> 00:31:37,129
And no one wants to be a clumsy samurai.

659
00:31:38,226 --> 00:31:41,668
Many players just stuck with the first stance, the one they were familiar with.

660
00:31:41,728 --> 00:31:43,690
We offered a new stance, they didn't even try it.

661
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:47,372
They knew how to win with the first stance, even if it was a struggle at times.

662
00:31:47,392 --> 00:31:49,733
They satisfied, to use the word I defined earlier.

663
00:31:50,574 --> 00:31:53,736
Other players did switch to the second stance, but then just

664
00:31:57,487 --> 00:32:01,151
So the key thing was to make sure that the first impression was a strong one.

665
00:32:01,171 --> 00:32:04,254
The first time they use water stance, which is the first stance you earn,

666
00:32:04,274 --> 00:32:07,638
you start with stone stance. You have to have a great experience.

667
00:32:08,705 --> 00:32:13,628
So the first step was to make sure that the value proposition is obvious.

668
00:32:14,248 --> 00:32:17,350
Water stance is really effective against guys holding shields.

669
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:21,133
You will blast through their blocks twice as fast as you will with stone stance.

670
00:32:21,933 --> 00:32:25,315
The number of hits to break a shield means noticeably lower.

671
00:32:25,395 --> 00:32:26,656
Players can count, they can tell.

672
00:32:27,697 --> 00:32:31,299
And we do subtle things too to make sure that the value proposition is clear.

673
00:32:31,819 --> 00:32:40,126
Like earlier we talked about how we sold heavy attacks by having the block meter flash when you did a heavy attack damage to let you know you did the right thing.

674
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:44,570
Well, if you're in the right stance and you do it, you get an even bigger flash.

675
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:48,033
We don't tell you this, it's just sort of subtle reinforcement that you're doing the right thing.

676
00:32:48,934 --> 00:32:52,256
Step number two is making sure to put the player in a good situation.

677
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:58,176
We're not in control of the timing of the player getting water stance, so we have dynamic training

678
00:32:58,236 --> 00:33:03,202
for it. Once the player gains water stance, we look for good opportunities to train it.

679
00:33:03,703 --> 00:33:08,169
To oversimplify, we wait for you to be one-on-one with the shieldman, then the training kicks in.

680
00:33:08,749 --> 00:33:12,652
Clock slows down, we walk you through switching to water stance and using water stance,

681
00:33:13,452 --> 00:33:16,995
and that's really effective. It's a little bit heavy-handed, especially since the training for

682
00:33:17,015 --> 00:33:22,558
stone stance is going to kick in right afterwards until you're in the first one-on-one situation

683
00:33:22,638 --> 00:33:27,301
with swordsman. But it is effective.

684
00:33:29,718 --> 00:33:32,140
And the third thing, the third step

685
00:33:32,461 --> 00:33:34,382
for getting people to really engage with stances

686
00:33:34,903 --> 00:33:37,225
was to add more anticipation to them.

687
00:33:37,866 --> 00:33:40,488
We actually make a big deal

688
00:33:40,528 --> 00:33:42,831
of making progress towards your next stance.

689
00:33:42,891 --> 00:33:43,531
It's hard work.

690
00:33:43,752 --> 00:33:44,813
You know, it doesn't come easy.

691
00:33:44,833 --> 00:33:45,954
It doesn't come out of a natural.

692
00:33:46,554 --> 00:33:52,419
a playthrough, we make you go after it, we make you spy on leaders, we make you kill leaders,

693
00:33:52,899 --> 00:33:55,882
and when you do, we make a big deal of the fact that you've made progress towards the next stance.

694
00:33:55,922 --> 00:34:00,105
And all of this puts the player in the right headspace. It prepares them for thinking this

695
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:04,408
stance is going to be a big deal, so at the point when they get it, and they go through this elaborate

696
00:34:04,428 --> 00:34:08,392
training, they're predisposed to think of it as being an important thing and to engage with it.

697
00:34:08,532 --> 00:34:09,472
And that was really effective.

698
00:34:10,553 --> 00:34:12,494
So what is the takeaway from this?

699
00:34:13,214 --> 00:34:15,395
Well, we followed this real pretty closely

700
00:34:15,455 --> 00:34:17,536
through all the new things we introduced in the game.

701
00:34:18,416 --> 00:34:20,477
We tried to make sure that the first impression you got

702
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:21,697
was a really positive one.

703
00:34:22,157 --> 00:34:23,898
So the first ghost tool you get is Kunai

704
00:34:24,038 --> 00:34:26,039
because it's the easiest to use and most effective.

705
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,119
And we make sure that it's great out of the box

706
00:34:28,279 --> 00:34:29,020
and that you're trained

707
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,900
and that your first experience is really a good one.

708
00:34:31,633 --> 00:34:37,355
The first samurai armor you get is better in all ways than the stuff you start with.

709
00:34:37,735 --> 00:34:40,696
It's more effective, it has better perks, and it's much sharper looking.

710
00:34:41,217 --> 00:34:44,298
The first time you assassinate somebody, it's useful and effective.

711
00:34:44,358 --> 00:34:48,159
There's no phase of clumsy and noisy assassinations when you're learning how to do it,

712
00:34:48,579 --> 00:34:51,000
even though that would have made way more sense for the story,

713
00:34:51,441 --> 00:34:53,581
because it would have made the first impression not as good.

714
00:34:54,182 --> 00:34:56,664
The first experience was something new sets the bar for everything that

715
00:34:56,864 --> 00:34:59,846
sets the tone for everything that follows. If it's not great, then the

716
00:34:59,886 --> 00:35:02,789
player won't engage with your feature. They'll just set it aside and go back to

717
00:35:02,829 --> 00:35:05,731
what they know. All right, let's switch gears again.

718
00:35:06,232 --> 00:35:08,834
It's pretty clear at this point, if you've listened to this talk

719
00:35:08,974 --> 00:35:11,996
to this point, that Ghost evolved a lot during

720
00:35:12,056 --> 00:35:14,799
its development. It was six years, we changed our mind about a lot of

721
00:35:14,819 --> 00:35:18,001
things a lot of times. Our design process historically

722
00:35:18,021 --> 00:35:20,563
has been very focused on prototypes and iteration.

723
00:35:21,336 --> 00:35:27,160
We did on the order of 35 full team internal playtests during Ghost development. We did about

724
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:32,664
25 external playtests and they were the external tests maybe half of them were took a week long

725
00:35:32,744 --> 00:35:37,608
or a week long and natural playthroughs of the game. Lots of testing and lots of iteration.

726
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,249
And if you're going to prototype

727
00:35:39,269 --> 00:35:40,750
type and iterate your way like this.

728
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:43,650
If that's your way of getting through to a successful game,

729
00:35:43,951 --> 00:35:45,691
then you have an important question to answer,

730
00:35:46,071 --> 00:35:48,852
which is what level of execution is necessary

731
00:35:48,892 --> 00:35:50,373
to fairly judge an idea?

732
00:35:50,953 --> 00:35:53,253
How developed does everything need to be

733
00:35:53,273 --> 00:35:55,054
before you can tell whether the idea is good or not?

734
00:35:55,574 --> 00:35:57,155
How developed do the controls need to be?

735
00:35:57,475 --> 00:35:59,936
What the animation or sound or camera design,

736
00:36:00,016 --> 00:36:03,037
VFX, haptics, writing, acting,

737
00:36:03,117 --> 00:36:04,417
like how good does everything have to be?

738
00:36:06,004 --> 00:36:11,851
The most important obvious problem you can, sorry, the most obvious problem you can have

739
00:36:12,091 --> 00:36:17,197
is giving up on an idea before it works. And that is a real problem. But the worst problem

740
00:36:17,497 --> 00:36:20,801
is not giving up an idea that's never going to work.

741
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:25,764
because counting on a doomed idea is much worse than giving up on one that never reaches its

742
00:36:25,804 --> 00:36:29,887
promise. Once you start counting on an idea working out, you start building around it,

743
00:36:30,267 --> 00:36:34,030
and then it becomes really hard to drop the bad idea without reworking everything else.

744
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:36,972
So you keep funneling resources into it, and that never really works.

745
00:36:38,193 --> 00:36:41,215
But if you're going to prototype an iterate, you can't

746
00:36:42,035 --> 00:36:45,658
expect you're going to implement everything all the way to shippable quality before you make

747
00:36:45,698 --> 00:36:50,442
decisions. You just don't have time. Most of our ideas don't pan out. So we have to build a

748
00:36:50,462 --> 00:36:56,146
prototype and test it, and somehow we have to figure out how to get reliable data from that test.

749
00:36:56,887 --> 00:37:00,770
So this can end in disaster, right? If you're not careful,

750
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:04,073
you'll get playtest data that pushes you in exactly the wrong direction.

751
00:37:05,205 --> 00:37:08,007
And it's because playtesters aren't great at projecting.

752
00:37:08,607 --> 00:37:10,669
It's hard for them to play a prototype

753
00:37:11,209 --> 00:37:13,851
and imagine what it's going to be once it's done,

754
00:37:13,951 --> 00:37:15,192
once it's fully realized.

755
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:17,053
Even our internal playtesters,

756
00:37:17,093 --> 00:37:18,874
even professional game developers aren't great at this.

757
00:37:19,315 --> 00:37:21,256
It's a really hard talent to squint

758
00:37:21,316 --> 00:37:23,437
in exactly the right way to see what the prototype

759
00:37:23,457 --> 00:37:25,299
will become rather than what it is.

760
00:37:25,919 --> 00:37:27,380
And there's one particular failure mode

761
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,281
that's really dangerous.

762
00:37:29,384 --> 00:37:32,406
Once the playtesters will round up on under-implanted ideas,

763
00:37:33,046 --> 00:37:36,008
if something is really obviously a placeholder or a stand-in,

764
00:37:36,408 --> 00:37:38,670
they'll imagine something awesome in its place.

765
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:41,892
The platonic ideal of whatever it is that you did,

766
00:37:42,432 --> 00:37:44,634
they'll say, this is obviously not done.

767
00:37:45,374 --> 00:37:46,555
It's going to be great once it's there.

768
00:37:47,415 --> 00:37:51,139
And secondly, they will round down on stuff that just needs polish.

769
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,222
They'll hear things like, ah, this animation doesn't look right,

770
00:37:54,262 --> 00:37:57,865
or this sound effect's garbage, or I'm not doing enough damage in this case,

771
00:37:58,446 --> 00:38:01,308
or here's an exploit I've found. I don't like this.

772
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:05,492
Here's a graph of the way this can run.

773
00:38:05,612 --> 00:38:07,453
And we've seen stuff that looks like this graph

774
00:38:07,573 --> 00:38:09,214
way too often, it's very painful for me.

775
00:38:10,334 --> 00:38:12,816
It shows player reaction to something you're iterating on.

776
00:38:13,156 --> 00:38:14,677
Time's moving from left to right here

777
00:38:14,757 --> 00:38:16,197
as you're making progress on an idea.

778
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:21,380
And like the player's, playtester's perceived value

779
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,281
for the feature or the ability

780
00:38:23,841 --> 00:38:25,002
is going from bottom to top.

781
00:38:25,462 --> 00:38:26,143
So what happens?

782
00:38:26,563 --> 00:38:28,664
Well, first you test the feature as a rough prototype

783
00:38:28,724 --> 00:38:29,664
and you know what's intended,

784
00:38:29,705 --> 00:38:31,025
but none of your playtesters get it.

785
00:38:31,977 --> 00:38:35,501
We'll call that incomprehension in the very beginning of the graph.

786
00:38:35,862 --> 00:38:38,384
Then you improve things. You leave some placeholder elements,

787
00:38:38,705 --> 00:38:40,647
but you get enough right to get people excited.

788
00:38:41,128 --> 00:38:43,931
They round up on the parts of your idea that look like placeholders.

789
00:38:43,971 --> 00:38:46,033
They imagine perfect solutions in all the empty slots.

790
00:38:46,414 --> 00:38:49,918
This is going to be great, they say. That's irrational exuberance.

791
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:54,661
Then you start finalizing and polishing things. You replace placeholder animations with final

792
00:38:54,721 --> 00:38:58,924
animations and placeholder effects with final ones. You put in some haptics. You play with

793
00:38:58,964 --> 00:39:03,447
a camera. The feature is much closer to done, so you test it again, and people hate it.

794
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:07,129
The probability function at this point is collapsed. Instead of possibility,

795
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:11,212
your playtesters are just seeing disappointment and disillusionment. That's despair.

796
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,701
Now, things can go one of two ways.

797
00:39:14,001 --> 00:39:17,083
Either through hard work and insight, you overcome the disillusionment,

798
00:39:17,123 --> 00:39:20,885
you find ways to hit the rewarding version of ideas people were imagining

799
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:24,667
during the irrational exuberance phase, and everyone ends up happy.

800
00:39:24,887 --> 00:39:26,268
You end up with victory.

801
00:39:27,369 --> 00:39:28,289
Or you don't.

802
00:39:28,889 --> 00:39:32,491
Playtesters were imagining things you can't deliver and things never improve.

803
00:39:32,972 --> 00:39:33,932
You end up in defeat.

804
00:39:34,771 --> 00:39:37,652
And your project won't survive too many graphs that end in defeat.

805
00:39:38,712 --> 00:39:43,513
And by the way, from personal experience, this happens at all scales in our playtests.

806
00:39:43,993 --> 00:39:48,034
We see graphs that look like this for individual features or individual components or individual

807
00:39:48,074 --> 00:39:53,115
missions. We also see graphs for the whole product that look like this. And wow, is it scary to see

808
00:39:53,135 --> 00:39:59,076
the scores for your game going down as you get closer to shipping. So this is bad. How do you

809
00:39:59,136 --> 00:40:00,597
avoid graphs that end in defeat?

810
00:40:01,567 --> 00:40:03,348
Well, there are a few things.

811
00:40:03,908 --> 00:40:05,689
First, you have to make sure you understand

812
00:40:05,709 --> 00:40:06,869
your experiential target.

813
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:09,050
You've got something you want the player to feel.

814
00:40:09,131 --> 00:40:10,991
You've got some experience you want them to have.

815
00:40:11,632 --> 00:40:13,293
For most of the stuff we did in Ghost,

816
00:40:13,653 --> 00:40:15,474
we wanted them to feel like an awesome samurai,

817
00:40:15,974 --> 00:40:16,935
in different ways.

818
00:40:17,855 --> 00:40:18,115
Second.

819
00:40:18,982 --> 00:40:21,964
There needs to be some spark in your idea that makes them feel this way.

820
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:24,967
Some bit of magic, the heart of your idea, the best part of your idea.

821
00:40:25,608 --> 00:40:28,130
We'll talk about what that bit was for a couple of ghost ideas

822
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:29,211
in the next couple of slides.

823
00:40:29,571 --> 00:40:32,694
But you have to know what this is when you're prototyping a feature.

824
00:40:33,419 --> 00:40:38,564
Then you have to figure out what will get in the way, what will distract players from this magic,

825
00:40:38,964 --> 00:40:45,069
what will confuse them about the key part of the experience, what will cause them to not give you

826
00:40:45,089 --> 00:40:50,094
the feedback on the magic but give you feedback on unimportant stuff. All of this stuff has to

827
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:52,436
be representative enough to not be a distraction.

828
00:40:53,277 --> 00:40:58,400
Representative here means close enough to shippable that playtesters don't imagine

829
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:02,964
replacing it with something better. When they're telling you how much they like the thing that

830
00:41:02,984 --> 00:41:07,927
you're testing, they imagine what you've shown them, not something they're imagining. For most

831
00:41:07,967 --> 00:41:12,391
of the stuff we did in Ghost, that means that controls have to be close to done because that's

832
00:41:12,411 --> 00:41:15,993
the hardest thing for people to imagine. Animation has to be representative.

833
00:41:16,393 --> 00:41:17,994
You have to have representative sound effects.

834
00:41:18,034 --> 00:41:19,455
The camera has to be representative.

835
00:41:19,975 --> 00:41:22,336
Sometimes other stuff like visual effects or haptic effects,

836
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:24,397
especially if they're playing a key part of the experience.

837
00:41:25,057 --> 00:41:28,779
This may seem like a lot to have to have done at

838
00:41:28,839 --> 00:41:32,600
an almost shippable level before you can count on your testing data.

839
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,161
That's a lot of stuff to polish.

840
00:41:35,049 --> 00:41:36,850
But there's even more that I've left out.

841
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:39,712
There's no mention of animation variety or progression,

842
00:41:40,173 --> 00:41:41,794
or character and environment models,

843
00:41:41,834 --> 00:41:43,716
which don't need to be polished in our experience.

844
00:41:44,176 --> 00:41:45,357
The UI is unimportant,

845
00:41:45,537 --> 00:41:46,758
unless it's the thing you're testing.

846
00:41:47,419 --> 00:41:48,860
Enemy variety, unimportant.

847
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:54,164
How the ability is costed or how it's constrained, not important.

848
00:41:54,685 --> 00:41:56,826
We generally don't worry too much about robustness.

849
00:41:57,268 --> 00:42:00,993
The ability of failing in some weird circumstance doesn't affect scores unless it's an exploit,

850
00:42:01,093 --> 00:42:02,234
so don't worry about it.

851
00:42:02,735 --> 00:42:05,999
Backstory, integration into the world, all this stuff just doesn't matter.

852
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:09,904
It'll have to get finished at some point, of course, but you can safely test without it.

853
00:42:10,244 --> 00:42:12,587
You can assume that you're going to be able to fill in those blanks

854
00:42:13,068 --> 00:42:15,371
and not get caught out too often.

855
00:42:16,012 --> 00:42:17,953
My phrase for this is clear path to victory.

856
00:42:18,473 --> 00:42:21,716
If you're not super confident that you have a clear path to victory,

857
00:42:21,756 --> 00:42:24,097
that you know how to get from the prototype to the finish line,

858
00:42:24,618 --> 00:42:27,400
or aren't super confident in how players will react to the ways

859
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,601
you're going to get to the finish line,

860
00:42:28,941 --> 00:42:31,723
then those things need to be present and representative in your prototype.

861
00:42:32,203 --> 00:42:33,444
Otherwise, you're rolling the dice.

862
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:37,607
Anything else can be omitted. Just leave it out.

863
00:42:37,667 --> 00:42:39,588
Seriously, don't even put a placeholder in.

864
00:42:39,608 --> 00:42:41,530
You're just wasting your time creating stuff,

865
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:42,731
and you're confusing the player.

866
00:42:42,791 --> 00:42:43,811
So just leave it out.

867
00:42:45,338 --> 00:42:46,680
So let's look at a couple of examples.

868
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,041
Let's look at standoffs for instance.

869
00:42:48,922 --> 00:42:50,243
So the inspiration for this

870
00:42:50,344 --> 00:42:52,185
is the Sakura Kurosawa movie, Sanjuro.

871
00:42:53,106 --> 00:42:54,848
At the end of Sanjuro, the two main characters

872
00:42:54,908 --> 00:42:56,870
retreat to a hillside for a duel.

873
00:42:57,010 --> 00:42:59,653
They stand, each of them with their hand on their katana,

874
00:42:59,833 --> 00:43:02,075
in tense anticipation, each waiting for movement,

875
00:43:02,516 --> 00:43:04,358
while all the grass waves about them.

876
00:43:04,758 --> 00:43:07,359
and it's still for an uncomfortable time.

877
00:43:07,419 --> 00:43:09,800
Then one samurai moves, but the other moves quicker

878
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,441
and the villain falls to the ground dead.

879
00:43:12,001 --> 00:43:14,442
This is an awesome scene in an awesome movie,

880
00:43:14,762 --> 00:43:15,502
which you should all watch.

881
00:43:16,643 --> 00:43:19,164
And we really wanted to capture that experience in Ghost.

882
00:43:19,904 --> 00:43:21,165
Well, what's the key to this?

883
00:43:21,205 --> 00:43:22,365
What's the magic point of this?

884
00:43:22,445 --> 00:43:23,285
And it's tension.

885
00:43:23,826 --> 00:43:24,586
If there's magic,

886
00:43:24,646 --> 00:43:26,607
it's going to be capturing that feeling of tension,

887
00:43:26,787 --> 00:43:29,668
this sense of stillness and incipient danger

888
00:43:29,688 --> 00:43:30,949
that explodes into action,

889
00:43:31,529 --> 00:43:33,510
danger and opportunity all wrapped up into one.

890
00:43:34,042 --> 00:43:37,484
So everything in the design of standoffs is focused on increasing tension.

891
00:43:38,024 --> 00:43:41,806
We take our time setting things up to let the tension build. You watch the characters walk

892
00:43:41,866 --> 00:43:47,229
into place. The control model isn't our standard attack model. Usually we have you tap a button to

893
00:43:47,269 --> 00:43:51,452
attack, but here we have you hold a button to ready yourself, then release it to attack,

894
00:43:51,492 --> 00:43:52,932
which is inherently a tense thing.

895
00:43:53,973 --> 00:43:58,917
And we use an iaijutsu attack, an attack where your katana starts inside the saiyan,

896
00:43:59,378 --> 00:44:02,020
and that leaves you vulnerable too because you don't even have your katana drawn.

897
00:44:02,861 --> 00:44:07,325
And finally, since it's a simple stimulus and response, the enemy movements can be faster

898
00:44:07,425 --> 00:44:12,109
than their normal attacks. They don't have long wind-ups in a standoff, they just attack.

899
00:44:12,549 --> 00:44:13,851
And you know this going into it.

900
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,412
You know that you're going to have less time to react

901
00:44:15,432 --> 00:44:16,854
than you do in normal gameplay.

902
00:44:17,294 --> 00:44:18,636
And that makes it feel more dangerous.

903
00:44:19,016 --> 00:44:21,859
Everything points at heightened tension during the standoff.

904
00:44:22,179 --> 00:44:24,562
So we prototyped this and there were glimpses of magic.

905
00:44:24,582 --> 00:44:26,404
It really was tense, but rewarding,

906
00:44:26,804 --> 00:44:27,885
even in an empty test world.

907
00:44:28,366 --> 00:44:30,528
So we had then the question we have to ask

908
00:44:30,588 --> 00:44:31,729
is what needs to be representative

909
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:32,951
before we can trust the magic?

910
00:44:33,771 --> 00:44:36,474
And in this case, animation, sound effects, visual effects,

911
00:44:36,634 --> 00:44:38,415
and there's some time slowdown, which is important.

912
00:44:38,435 --> 00:44:40,797
So we do that with the control model and the camera,

913
00:44:41,318 --> 00:44:42,919
but everything else is missing at that point.

914
00:44:42,939 --> 00:44:43,900
We don't need to worry about,

915
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,701
we did this in test world, it didn't matter.

916
00:44:46,547 --> 00:44:50,589
So this was actually a point of commitment for us

917
00:44:50,689 --> 00:44:55,610
because we showed a standoff as part of our demo at E3 2018.

918
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:57,751
So we were sort of committing ourselves to doing this.

919
00:44:58,271 --> 00:44:59,792
And at this point it was only a prototype

920
00:44:59,872 --> 00:45:01,932
and this did not work in the game in general.

921
00:45:02,333 --> 00:45:04,313
The standoff in the demo was special rigging.

922
00:45:04,413 --> 00:45:05,694
It was real, you played it,

923
00:45:06,114 --> 00:45:07,974
but it wasn't systemically there in the game.

924
00:45:08,014 --> 00:45:10,455
We hadn't really tested it in the context of the whole game,

925
00:45:10,855 --> 00:45:13,316
but we were confident we had a clear path to victory

926
00:45:13,336 --> 00:45:14,036
for everything else.

927
00:45:14,116 --> 00:45:16,177
We trusted in the magic, we trusted the prototype.

928
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:20,012
We didn't worry too much about when and where you can do standoffs or why,

929
00:45:20,072 --> 00:45:21,873
because the standoff model itself was so strong.

930
00:45:22,773 --> 00:45:27,455
Now, as it turns out, some of the questions we had to answer were hard to answer.

931
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:30,836
And we were a little bit overconfident, and there was a lot of work involved

932
00:45:30,856 --> 00:45:33,698
to getting standoffs to the point where they work systemically in the game.

933
00:45:34,338 --> 00:45:36,379
But it was mostly engineering work.

934
00:45:36,799 --> 00:45:40,100
It wasn't finding the magic, it was just making the magic reliable.

935
00:45:40,501 --> 00:45:42,681
There is a tech note about this with more details.

936
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:46,429
So here's another example, and this also comes from E3 2018.

937
00:45:46,549 --> 00:45:48,090
Chain assassination.

938
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:51,911
In that demo, we showed Jin leaping down from the rafters of the temple

939
00:45:52,091 --> 00:45:54,152
and assassinating three Mongols in quick succession

940
00:45:54,852 --> 00:45:56,232
in a very flashy manner.

941
00:45:56,632 --> 00:45:57,833
It's a great power moment.

942
00:45:58,373 --> 00:46:01,194
And the nice part about this move is that it's naturally limited.

943
00:46:01,394 --> 00:46:02,374
You can't do it all the time.

944
00:46:02,394 --> 00:46:04,015
You have to have three guys standing near each other,

945
00:46:04,895 --> 00:46:08,436
and you have to be able to maneuver to get above the jumping range of one of them.

946
00:46:08,916 --> 00:46:10,937
So you really don't have to worry about it being overpowered.

947
00:46:10,957 --> 00:46:12,117
You can really crank things up.

948
00:46:12,778 --> 00:46:17,704
The magic of this is pretty obvious. There's this attention to get into a position without

949
00:46:17,725 --> 00:46:22,131
getting spotted. There's a feeling of mastery once you're there and you're choosing your target.

950
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:26,361
And here for once, we actually went with a very slow targeting model.

951
00:46:26,501 --> 00:46:28,702
In Ghost, most of the targeting has to run really fast,

952
00:46:28,722 --> 00:46:30,283
because we want the game to be fast-paced.

953
00:46:30,303 --> 00:46:31,824
We want there to be lots of pressure on you.

954
00:46:32,404 --> 00:46:35,385
But in this case, we're trying to draw out that sense of anticipation,

955
00:46:35,425 --> 00:46:38,267
that sense of mastery that you're about to drop down on these guys.

956
00:46:38,307 --> 00:46:41,208
So the targeting model is slow and precise.

957
00:46:41,788 --> 00:46:43,989
And finally, once you trigger the move,

958
00:46:44,029 --> 00:46:46,190
you get this spectacle of this chain assassination

959
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:50,372
with flashy moves and flashy camera and flashy time slowdown.

960
00:46:50,472 --> 00:46:51,553
Just spectacle.

961
00:46:52,573 --> 00:46:55,695
So what had to be representative here for us to trust the magic

962
00:46:56,736 --> 00:47:00,578
animation, getting the time slow down, visual effects, getting the camera.

963
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:03,600
In this case, we needed to have the environment be pretty representative

964
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:08,023
of the temple in the demo because this is a stealth move and the

965
00:47:08,063 --> 00:47:11,925
environment usually plays an important part in stealth abilities. But everything

966
00:47:11,965 --> 00:47:15,787
else is admitted. We don't worry about anything else. That was all we had to worry about getting right.

967
00:47:16,328 --> 00:47:19,730
Once we had that stuff right, we had a clear path to victory. We knew we could get it to

968
00:47:19,810 --> 00:47:20,630
conform in the game.

969
00:47:21,131 --> 00:47:22,752
And in fact, in this case, we were right.

970
00:47:23,012 --> 00:47:24,733
This one was easier to finish than standoffs.

971
00:47:24,753 --> 00:47:27,476
The areas where we left out things we didn't have done,

972
00:47:28,236 --> 00:47:30,138
in fact, were pretty straightforward to get working.

973
00:47:30,178 --> 00:47:33,020
We had bugs to fix, but nothing that really ever risked the feature.

974
00:47:35,017 --> 00:47:39,038
Here's the final takeaway then from this, from the last rule.

975
00:47:40,058 --> 00:47:43,639
When you're working on something new, the first thing you need to do is find the magic.

976
00:47:44,159 --> 00:47:48,640
You've got some experiential target in mind, some emotional response you want the player to have.

977
00:47:49,321 --> 00:47:52,942
Identify the magic bit of your idea that produces that experiential target.

978
00:47:53,863 --> 00:47:58,445
When you're working on the idea, you might only get a glimpse of the magic, right? It might not

979
00:47:58,505 --> 00:48:03,708
work every time. Maybe your timing was exactly right on triggering the ability and it looked

980
00:48:04,129 --> 00:48:09,071
awesome and you felt like a star. Maybe the enemies you had lined up in exactly the right

981
00:48:09,091 --> 00:48:14,234
configuration and your animations looked awesome. Maybe the random number generator bounced your way

982
00:48:14,294 --> 00:48:15,195
and everything clicked.

983
00:48:16,135 --> 00:48:18,678
When that happens, when you get a glimpse of the magic,

984
00:48:18,698 --> 00:48:20,700
when the feature works great once,

985
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:23,002
you've got the spark to build from.

986
00:48:23,462 --> 00:48:25,885
Your goal at that point is just to make the magic happen

987
00:48:25,905 --> 00:48:26,665
more reliably.

988
00:48:27,366 --> 00:48:28,647
And usually that's a lot easier

989
00:48:28,667 --> 00:48:30,069
than finding the magic to begin with.

990
00:48:30,329 --> 00:48:31,470
Usually it's just engineering.

991
00:48:32,131 --> 00:48:33,532
If nothing feels like magic,

992
00:48:33,972 --> 00:48:35,734
and it has to feel like magic to play testers,

993
00:48:35,754 --> 00:48:38,397
not just to you, then you probably don't have a winner.

994
00:48:38,937 --> 00:48:40,859
You don't have something you can build your product around.

995
00:48:41,352 --> 00:48:46,875
Not everything in your game needs to be magic, but you have to have enough magical moments or you're

996
00:48:46,895 --> 00:48:51,517
not going to succeed. And that's the fifth rule. So I've got all the way through five rules,

997
00:48:52,377 --> 00:48:56,579
and here they are all on one slide. Five general rules of game design we learned while making

998
00:48:56,619 --> 00:49:01,842
Ghost in Tsushima. I hope this has been helpful or interesting, and I hope that one or more of

999
00:49:01,862 --> 00:49:06,404
these rules will be applicable to your own games. And if not, it was only an hour of your time,

1000
00:49:06,764 --> 00:49:07,244
and they were pretty

1001
