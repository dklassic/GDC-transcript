1
00:00:05,571 --> 00:00:06,992
So welcome, everybody.

2
00:00:07,012 --> 00:00:09,495
I know it's probably been a long week,

3
00:00:09,555 --> 00:00:11,257
and it's first thing on a Friday.

4
00:00:11,377 --> 00:00:12,899
So if you're not hungover, you could

5
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:14,281
have been sleeping in anyway.

6
00:00:15,402 --> 00:00:18,005
So I'm supposed to tell you to silence your cell phones

7
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:20,468
if somehow you haven't heard that already this week.

8
00:00:21,569 --> 00:00:23,432
And there'll be a survey that you'll get.

9
00:00:23,792 --> 00:00:24,633
And say nice things.

10
00:00:27,096 --> 00:00:28,377
So, I'm Matt Brown.

11
00:00:28,777 --> 00:00:31,379
I'm the studio creative director for Maxis.

12
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,942
In a previous life, I was the technical director

13
00:00:35,042 --> 00:00:36,142
and designer for Sims 2

14
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:37,663
and the creative director for Sims 3.

15
00:00:39,044 --> 00:00:42,787
So, I spent a lot of time, several years,

16
00:00:42,867 --> 00:00:44,488
with these little people in their little houses

17
00:00:44,508 --> 00:00:45,248
with their little jobs,

18
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:51,393
and I spent countless hours arguing about urine.

19
00:00:53,746 --> 00:00:58,009
And when a sim pees themselves, what color should the puddle be?

20
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:02,513
It turns out not yellow. Who knew?

21
00:01:03,013 --> 00:01:07,517
And if the sim does pee themselves and they leave a puddle, should dogs be able to lick it up?

22
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:11,059
And should toddlers be able to play in it?

23
00:01:12,601 --> 00:01:15,603
And if they do play in it, should we switch them into galoshes and a raincoat?

24
00:01:17,785 --> 00:01:19,046
Seriously, it's a weird job.

25
00:01:21,075 --> 00:01:23,196
So I want to share some of that with you guys today.

26
00:01:24,177 --> 00:01:26,618
Not the urine. That would be weird. I'm not going to share urine with you.

27
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:30,801
Actually, there probably is urine in this talk.

28
00:01:31,241 --> 00:01:32,202
But anyway.

29
00:01:32,562 --> 00:01:35,924
Actually, now I've said urine so much.

30
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,383
uh... so no it while the sims started out as a behavioral simulation

31
00:01:43,404 --> 00:01:47,087
uh... the over the years it's definitely become more of uh... we call a

32
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:47,848
storytelling engine

33
00:01:48,368 --> 00:01:50,090
uh... largely because that's the way the players play it

34
00:01:50,751 --> 00:01:54,514
uh... and uh... as designers we've embraced that and uh... we you know we

35
00:01:54,995 --> 00:01:56,996
cater a lot of our design thinking in our design

36
00:01:57,017 --> 00:01:58,978
uh... design systems and patterns

37
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:01,561
um... towards storytelling so for the rest of this talk

38
00:02:02,402 --> 00:02:07,336
I'm going to walk through several of the techniques that we use to facilitate those sorts of stories

39
00:02:07,536 --> 00:02:10,545
and to enable more player agency in telling their own stories.

40
00:02:12,611 --> 00:02:16,533
But before I get into the actual techniques that we use,

41
00:02:17,034 --> 00:02:18,875
I wanna walk through a really brief overview

42
00:02:18,995 --> 00:02:20,436
of sort of the key design philosophies

43
00:02:20,796 --> 00:02:23,097
as a bit of an explanation of how the core behavioral AI

44
00:02:23,137 --> 00:02:26,139
in the Sims works, because a lot of our design patterns

45
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:27,299
rely really heavily on that.

46
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,481
Most of you probably are familiar with this

47
00:02:29,521 --> 00:02:30,941
if you've heard other talks in the past

48
00:02:31,001 --> 00:02:32,162
or read articles, so I'll go pretty quick.

49
00:02:34,998 --> 00:02:37,098
So the Sims is fundamentally about nurturing.

50
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:39,379
We want players to feel compelled

51
00:02:39,399 --> 00:02:40,299
to take care of their Sims.

52
00:02:40,679 --> 00:02:42,299
We want them to feel like the Sims need them.

53
00:02:44,259 --> 00:02:45,980
And generally speaking, the objects and the interactions

54
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,060
and such in the Sims are grounded in reality.

55
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,301
And we take liberties with culture and the timeframe.

56
00:02:51,741 --> 00:02:53,461
But for the most part, the world is something

57
00:02:53,481 --> 00:02:54,621
that players are familiar with.

58
00:02:55,941 --> 00:02:58,862
And we give the Sims similar motivations to actual humans.

59
00:02:58,882 --> 00:03:00,622
And I'll get into that in a minute.

60
00:03:01,062 --> 00:03:03,303
So that the player can relate to them and understand them.

61
00:03:05,201 --> 00:03:06,521
and then we make the sims imperfect

62
00:03:07,302 --> 00:03:07,962
there's already urine

63
00:03:08,403 --> 00:03:09,804
it's not even, it's like the first slide

64
00:03:11,445 --> 00:03:16,348
the sims make mistakes and that's very intentional and the player

65
00:03:16,408 --> 00:03:19,510
instinctively knows that because they can relate to the sims and it makes them

66
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:20,291
want to help them

67
00:03:20,771 --> 00:03:22,372
and if a sim pees themselves like this

68
00:03:23,433 --> 00:03:24,854
you don't need to have peed yourself

69
00:03:25,114 --> 00:03:27,635
I mean maybe you did but you don't need to have done that in order to

70
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:29,256
empathize because you can relate to them

71
00:03:31,143 --> 00:03:32,304
Because people are parents.

72
00:03:33,445 --> 00:03:35,127
If you're literally a parent, or even if you're not,

73
00:03:35,207 --> 00:03:38,390
it's in us, and we manipulate that on The Sims,

74
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,431
because we're dicks.

75
00:03:41,793 --> 00:03:44,055
Now back in the 40s, a psychologist named Abraham Maslow

76
00:03:45,456 --> 00:03:47,058
proposed a theory of human motivation

77
00:03:47,238 --> 00:03:49,620
known as Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs.

78
00:03:50,241 --> 00:03:52,002
And it's basically a smart guy way

79
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:53,484
of saying first things first.

80
00:03:54,845 --> 00:03:58,628
In essence, it says that human beings need to satisfy basic primal needs before they

81
00:03:58,648 --> 00:03:59,669
can move on to higher order needs.

82
00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:03,231
So I need to feel physiologically stable, I need oxygen, water, food, clothing, and

83
00:04:03,251 --> 00:04:03,531
so on.

84
00:04:03,832 --> 00:04:06,654
Basically things that if I don't have them I'm going to die today or tomorrow.

85
00:04:07,675 --> 00:04:11,758
Before I can start thinking about higher order things, which Maslow called safety, but really

86
00:04:11,778 --> 00:04:15,841
what he's talking about is your career, your credit card balance, your 401k, things like

87
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:16,001
that.

88
00:04:16,902 --> 00:04:18,523
And until I have those things under control,

89
00:04:20,184 --> 00:04:22,126
I can't really start focusing on my relationships,

90
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:25,048
my family, my friends, being part of my community, and so on.

91
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:29,011
Now, in the Sims, we don't generally go into these upper levels

92
00:04:29,752 --> 00:04:32,454
of esteem and self-actualization and more heady things,

93
00:04:32,914 --> 00:04:34,616
although there are some systems like building skills,

94
00:04:34,656 --> 00:04:36,477
learning to play music, learning to paint, things like that,

95
00:04:37,138 --> 00:04:39,840
that touch on this a little bit because you can't actually focus on those

96
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,201
until you've dealt with those lower-level things,

97
00:04:42,262 --> 00:04:44,043
but they're pretty shallow, generally.

98
00:04:44,843 --> 00:04:48,986
Now, everybody knows this, I'm sure, but that hierarchy is represented pretty literally

99
00:04:49,946 --> 00:04:52,847
in The Sims as what we call motives, hunger, bladder, energy.

100
00:04:52,867 --> 00:04:55,309
They're basically values from 0 to 100.

101
00:04:55,529 --> 00:05:00,191
They decay over time and you can fill them back up by performing actions on those objects

102
00:05:00,251 --> 00:05:01,151
or on various objects.

103
00:05:03,123 --> 00:05:06,386
Now on the surface, that doesn't seem like it has a whole lot to do with storytelling,

104
00:05:06,847 --> 00:05:14,173
but a primary component of storytelling in The Sims is relatability and casual understandability.

105
00:05:15,394 --> 00:05:22,860
Because, at least theoretically, all humans and by association most Sims players are doing this their whole lives.

106
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,284
We're on this pyramid, we're on this hierarchy, and we're trying to get as far up it as we can.

107
00:05:28,525 --> 00:05:32,810
And that means the players can kind of immediately understand the Sims thought processes

108
00:05:33,811 --> 00:05:36,073
and what's expected of them, the player and the Sims.

109
00:05:37,274 --> 00:05:41,959
Now in The Sims, the AI is grounded in that theory, in Maslow's hierarchy.

110
00:05:43,241 --> 00:05:45,663
I usually refer to the AI in The Sims as Big A, Small I,

111
00:05:46,344 --> 00:05:49,908
because it's marginally intelligent and it's really, really artificial.

112
00:05:51,844 --> 00:05:59,829
But in many ways, it's that simplicity that makes it possible for so many behaviors to work together and for emergent situations to arise.

113
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:09,135
And the way it works is essentially the Sims look around the world asking objects, you know, what affordances they have, what interactions are possible.

114
00:06:09,755 --> 00:06:11,896
We say that those interactions advertise to the Sims.

115
00:06:12,737 --> 00:06:14,137
telling them which motives will be satisfied

116
00:06:14,177 --> 00:06:15,998
and by how much and so on,

117
00:06:16,018 --> 00:06:17,019
if they perform those interactions.

118
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:19,240
So real quick, for example, if you have a toilet,

119
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,501
it might offer use, flush, clean, if it's dirty,

120
00:06:21,601 --> 00:06:22,541
repair if it's broken.

121
00:06:23,221 --> 00:06:25,222
Fridge might offer to have a snack, cook something.

122
00:06:25,262 --> 00:06:26,383
The bed might offer to nap.

123
00:06:27,463 --> 00:06:30,625
And the sim then scores all of those possible actions

124
00:06:30,685 --> 00:06:32,526
based on their distance, assorted gating

125
00:06:32,546 --> 00:06:34,486
and modulating factors like personality traits,

126
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,887
relationships and so on, motives,

127
00:06:38,308 --> 00:06:39,569
and chooses what to do based on that.

128
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:45,052
And traditionally, we have intentionally had them choose

129
00:06:45,693 --> 00:06:47,474
randomly from the best interactions,

130
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:48,634
not choose the best one.

131
00:06:48,835 --> 00:06:51,136
Again, because we want them to be suboptimal,

132
00:06:51,156 --> 00:06:52,297
we want them to make mistakes.

133
00:06:53,738 --> 00:06:54,318
And that's really it.

134
00:06:54,578 --> 00:06:56,519
There's no machine learning, there's no behavior trees,

135
00:06:56,559 --> 00:06:57,620
there's no planning.

136
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,681
Sims are really just hamsters with jobs.

137
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:06,842
And the last thing that I want to talk about with sort of this core to the Sims,

138
00:07:06,862 --> 00:07:08,764
it's what I call self-evident dependencies.

139
00:07:10,265 --> 00:07:13,989
By grounding the game in sort of mundane, obvious, and often pedestrian near-reality,

140
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:17,492
players generally don't have to guess what to do,

141
00:07:17,932 --> 00:07:20,194
or more importantly, what the Sims should be doing.

142
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:22,436
So, if a Sim needs to pee...

143
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,931
I know what to do. Obviously, I need to have them use the toilet.

144
00:07:26,172 --> 00:07:27,272
So I need to buy them a toilet.

145
00:07:27,573 --> 00:07:29,975
And to buy a toilet, I need money. So I need to get a job.

146
00:07:30,475 --> 00:07:32,777
And if I want to get a job, well, I'll go to the computer or a cell phone,

147
00:07:32,817 --> 00:07:36,260
or depending on which version of the game, I might just drive down to the restaurant

148
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,641
and ask if they need anybody to work there.

149
00:07:40,443 --> 00:07:43,065
And in general, same is true for the larger core loop of the game.

150
00:07:44,026 --> 00:07:47,689
And that fundamental understanding and ability to relate to and empathize with your Sims

151
00:07:47,989 --> 00:07:50,791
and their plight underlies most of the storytelling in The Sims.

152
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:55,872
All right, so let's get into some of the specific techniques that we use.

153
00:07:55,892 --> 00:08:00,236
So this is, the way this is sort of structured is it kind of starts with things that are a little more

154
00:08:00,276 --> 00:08:05,560
sim-specific and then sort of works its way into things that could pretty much be used anywhere, I think.

155
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,422
So I generally group them into a few categories.

156
00:08:09,643 --> 00:08:12,285
So the first I want to talk about is projection and assumption.

157
00:08:13,246 --> 00:08:18,089
So, all right, quick survey, show of hands, just how many people have played any version of The Sims?

158
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:19,330
One, two, three, four.

159
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,672
Ooh, wow, that's pretty much everybody.

160
00:08:21,052 --> 00:08:23,093
You make a game for 20 years, eventually everybody will play it.

161
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:27,260
So one more survey.

162
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,362
So since you've all played The Sims,

163
00:08:29,402 --> 00:08:30,703
how many people remember the first time

164
00:08:30,763 --> 00:08:32,704
their stove caught fire and somebody burned to death?

165
00:08:34,025 --> 00:08:35,927
All right, probably two thirds.

166
00:08:37,628 --> 00:08:39,569
So that's an example of something I call the Snowflake Con.

167
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:41,391
And I'll explain what I mean by that.

168
00:08:42,031 --> 00:08:43,933
But first, my experience with that.

169
00:08:44,433 --> 00:08:46,275
So this is my son, Aiden.

170
00:08:47,275 --> 00:08:49,357
And a couple of years ago, he doesn't look like this now,

171
00:08:49,638 --> 00:08:53,002
but a couple of years ago when he did look like this,

172
00:08:53,662 --> 00:08:55,164
I sat him down in front of Daddy's game

173
00:08:55,845 --> 00:08:57,267
and so that I could watch how he played,

174
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:58,708
see how he set goals and things like that

175
00:08:58,728 --> 00:09:00,491
because we use our kids as test subjects

176
00:09:00,531 --> 00:09:01,972
and that's okay because it's our job.

177
00:09:03,534 --> 00:09:05,275
and my job is about peeing, so it's okay.

178
00:09:05,955 --> 00:09:08,296
And he proceeded to go into Create-a-Sim

179
00:09:08,736 --> 00:09:11,798
and make my wife, his mom, and myself,

180
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:14,239
which is not flattering, so I don't have a picture of that,

181
00:09:15,339 --> 00:09:16,139
and then he started playing.

182
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,140
And then, after about 20 minutes or so,

183
00:09:18,681 --> 00:09:20,501
mom, mommy, and daddy started to get hungry,

184
00:09:20,741 --> 00:09:22,662
so he decided to have mom cook something on the stove.

185
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:24,843
But because she had no cooking skill,

186
00:09:25,664 --> 00:09:26,544
she started a fire.

187
00:09:27,224 --> 00:09:29,446
So he scrambled around trying to figure out how to put it out.

188
00:09:30,066 --> 00:09:32,608
But since he didn't know the game at all, it was too late.

189
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:36,450
And Mommy writhed in pain and was engulfed in flames.

190
00:09:37,251 --> 00:09:38,671
And then Mommy was burned to a crisp.

191
00:09:39,452 --> 00:09:41,813
And the Grim Reaper showed up and he took her away.

192
00:09:42,354 --> 00:09:45,896
I'm sure that would have been funny if you weren't six.

193
00:09:47,217 --> 00:09:49,118
And he left behind a tombstone

194
00:09:49,418 --> 00:09:51,139
that literally had a tooltip that said, Mommy.

195
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:53,834
Oh, that's what he named her.

196
00:09:54,796 --> 00:09:56,037
And my son lost his shit.

197
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,781
So he's just bawling.

198
00:09:58,941 --> 00:10:01,945
And so his mom runs over to see what was wrong.

199
00:10:02,225 --> 00:10:03,807
And I tell her that she had, in fact, just

200
00:10:03,847 --> 00:10:06,631
burned in a kitchen fire because she's a horrible cook, which

201
00:10:06,911 --> 00:10:09,595
I thought was hilarious and kind of accurate.

202
00:10:11,685 --> 00:10:13,686
uh... but uh... she turns on the parenting because

203
00:10:14,367 --> 00:10:16,489
she's mom and and she starts comforting him and

204
00:10:16,889 --> 00:10:18,110
she's telling him that's just a game

205
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:21,572
it's not really mommy and obviously nothing happened to mommy, mommy's standing right here

206
00:10:22,013 --> 00:10:23,654
and my son who's still wiping away tears

207
00:10:24,034 --> 00:10:26,316
just says, I know that mom, I just forgot to save my game

208
00:10:29,238 --> 00:10:29,278
uh...

209
00:10:29,777 --> 00:10:36,039
And my wife was projecting her assumptions about those events onto the whole thing and how they would make someone feel.

210
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:43,262
But onto my son, I thought this was just a hilarious sitcom moment that meant that I'd done my job and this game was awesome.

211
00:10:43,802 --> 00:10:46,343
And my son just was worried about losing progress.

212
00:10:50,407 --> 00:10:56,032
So, ever since the original Sims, the game has been tuned to pretty much ensure that very early in the first game,

213
00:10:56,833 --> 00:11:00,716
as evidenced by the hands, players will feel compelled to attempt to cook something.

214
00:11:01,377 --> 00:11:04,620
They won't have the skill when they do, and the stove will probably catch fire,

215
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:11,046
and because your first fire is just a crazy chaotic moment that you don't have any idea how to deal with, someone inevitably dies.

216
00:11:11,667 --> 00:11:16,071
It's not scripted at all, but it's encouraged through tuning.

217
00:11:16,871 --> 00:11:18,611
A fire doesn't always start, and when it does,

218
00:11:18,631 --> 00:11:22,272
it doesn't always do much damage or kill anyone.

219
00:11:22,912 --> 00:11:23,913
And when it does kill someone,

220
00:11:24,193 --> 00:11:26,073
it's obviously not predetermined who that is.

221
00:11:26,093 --> 00:11:28,514
In fact, there might not even be another sim there

222
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:29,134
to witness it.

223
00:11:31,594 --> 00:11:33,715
But honestly, desperately attempting to cook a grilled cheese

224
00:11:33,755 --> 00:11:35,755
in the middle of the night to prevent your starving to death

225
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:38,116
and then dying anyway, alone, in your kitchen

226
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:39,456
because of a fire that you started

227
00:11:39,476 --> 00:11:42,717
because you suck at cooking, is not a bad story.

228
00:11:44,517 --> 00:11:45,377
And we didn't write it.

229
00:11:45,697 --> 00:11:45,917
You did.

230
00:11:48,957 --> 00:11:50,517
So the reason I call it the Snowflake Con,

231
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:54,078
well, the con part should be obvious.

232
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:56,619
People generally think that it is their own story

233
00:11:56,739 --> 00:11:58,620
and technically it happens to most people.

234
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,561
But everyone wants to feel special,

235
00:12:00,601 --> 00:12:01,541
like a unique snowflake.

236
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:04,582
And giving them enough control over the specifics

237
00:12:05,042 --> 00:12:06,503
of their story scratches that itch

238
00:12:06,843 --> 00:12:08,143
and pulls them into that story

239
00:12:08,183 --> 00:12:09,664
in a really, really special way.

240
00:12:10,857 --> 00:12:13,700
That same story happens to almost everyone eventually,

241
00:12:14,221 --> 00:12:16,023
but each story is just different enough

242
00:12:16,423 --> 00:12:19,426
and each person's perception of what happened

243
00:12:19,486 --> 00:12:21,568
and how they felt makes it unique and special

244
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:24,031
and personal enough to be worth sharing.

245
00:12:24,932 --> 00:12:26,413
For my son, it wasn't just anybody,

246
00:12:26,633 --> 00:12:28,435
it was mommy burning and it was daddy

247
00:12:28,776 --> 00:12:29,777
failing to put out the fire.

248
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:32,820
So he's probably still got that rattling around

249
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,340
in here somewhere.

250
00:12:35,748 --> 00:12:38,329
So another projection trick that we use all the time is ambiguity.

251
00:12:38,769 --> 00:12:42,950
In The Sims, we use players' innate propensity to project to our advantage,

252
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,051
kind of pretty much everywhere.

253
00:12:44,471 --> 00:12:48,092
And to that end, we're often intentionally vague when communicating with the player,

254
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,113
particularly when explaining the Sims' motivations.

255
00:12:51,314 --> 00:12:54,735
We always try to leave the room, leave the player room to project

256
00:12:55,235 --> 00:12:57,256
their assumptions and preconceptions onto their Sims.

257
00:12:57,996 --> 00:12:59,416
Sometimes that's really hard to do as a designer.

258
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:07,922
that we often achieve that. I said I've mentioned before, but communicating to the player in a manner that forces them to interpret the information subjectively

259
00:13:08,342 --> 00:13:12,707
rather than objectively. There's just not enough there for them to objectively evaluate it.

260
00:13:13,568 --> 00:13:16,491
And we generally do that by being very vague or offering incomplete information.

261
00:13:17,747 --> 00:13:21,269
So one of the oldest and most obvious examples of this are thought and speech balloons.

262
00:13:21,289 --> 00:13:23,331
Like the Sims communicate almost entirely with these.

263
00:13:24,051 --> 00:13:26,233
So there's, they aren't always random.

264
00:13:26,593 --> 00:13:28,174
They actually sometimes have intent.

265
00:13:29,515 --> 00:13:31,797
But they're clearly leave plenty of room to project.

266
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:35,980
And there are thousands of these in the game.

267
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,062
Plus urine, because I keep my promises.

268
00:13:42,252 --> 00:13:44,833
But another richer example is spoken language, which again,

269
00:13:44,853 --> 00:13:46,754
everybody's familiar with The Sims, so you've heard this,

270
00:13:46,794 --> 00:13:49,715
but quickly, The Sims is, they speak their own language

271
00:13:49,855 --> 00:13:52,356
called Simlish, and it's this wonderfully ambiguous

272
00:13:52,436 --> 00:13:54,337
and vague mechanism.

273
00:13:54,977 --> 00:13:57,718
And it's a reason that we have never even attempted

274
00:13:57,778 --> 00:13:59,479
to put real language on The Sims,

275
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,200
because this idea of Simlish is so powerful,

276
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,142
and so, from a player projection standpoint.

277
00:14:05,422 --> 00:14:06,682
It sets a tone for an interaction,

278
00:14:06,742 --> 00:14:08,163
it leaves a ton of room for the player

279
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:10,404
to project onto what's happening and to make it their own.

280
00:14:11,104 --> 00:14:13,685
And if we use actual language, the game would flatten and shrink

281
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,246
and everyone would be having the same experience.

282
00:14:17,987 --> 00:14:20,508
And that ambiguity also tends to make the Sims feel smarter

283
00:14:20,908 --> 00:14:21,548
than they actually are.

284
00:14:21,808 --> 00:14:24,809
And it can actually hide cases where we're doing something wrong.

285
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,570
Because you really can't tell how wrong it is

286
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:28,911
because you can't tell exactly what they're saying.

287
00:14:29,996 --> 00:14:34,600
So if a Sim had an argument and he was reciting an exact specific argument, well one, you'd hear the repetition.

288
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,243
But we also run the risk of going against the player's story.

289
00:14:38,283 --> 00:14:42,606
Like the player may think this argument is about one thing and then we make it so clear that it's about something else.

290
00:14:43,207 --> 00:14:47,290
And the player, you know, the player feels this dissonance and it messes up their story.

291
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:49,252
So a couple of really quick examples.

292
00:14:50,132 --> 00:14:51,734
So the first one is the end of an argument.

293
00:14:52,534 --> 00:14:53,635
Walla-kay, Mobsy!

294
00:14:56,576 --> 00:14:58,696
uh... you know the arguments about you know she's pissed

295
00:14:59,177 --> 00:14:59,337
uh...

296
00:15:00,157 --> 00:15:01,877
you know she

297
00:15:03,578 --> 00:15:05,078
that is someone morning at a funeral

298
00:15:06,478 --> 00:15:08,779
but it obviously could be someone being sad in any context

299
00:15:09,319 --> 00:15:10,499
uh... in a

300
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,020
uh... ish you can project on that everyone

301
00:15:17,921 --> 00:15:19,102
and uh... uh... and

302
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:21,242
what's so far

303
00:15:22,162 --> 00:15:23,503
that is sex that didn't go well

304
00:15:24,414 --> 00:15:26,498
Woo! What's so Famba?

305
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:34,821
So one last quick note on ambiguity, something that should be obvious but that we discovered over time is that wrong is

306
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:37,262
almost always worse than saying nothing.

307
00:15:38,302 --> 00:15:39,883
So as designers we have this natural tendency

308
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:41,683
to want to tell the player everything.

309
00:15:42,463 --> 00:15:45,724
We want to make sure that you're getting all of our genius and you don't miss any of it.

310
00:15:46,524 --> 00:15:49,745
But if we explain something that the player had already projected their own narrative onto,

311
00:15:49,885 --> 00:15:52,926
similarly to my example of using natural, real English,

312
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:57,067
or real language, if we do that and we get it wrong, then the player's story collapses

313
00:15:57,587 --> 00:15:58,028
and the magic...

314
00:15:58,888 --> 00:15:59,729
just disappears.

315
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:04,713
So I have a couple of images here, I don't have a heading for them,

316
00:16:05,473 --> 00:16:09,457
but they're really an abject lesson in how player projection can sometimes go too far,

317
00:16:09,857 --> 00:16:10,497
or be a problem.

318
00:16:10,938 --> 00:16:13,240
This is a series of experiments, we didn't ship these, you'll see why,

319
00:16:14,661 --> 00:16:17,483
that we tested where we were trying to make certain sims,

320
00:16:17,503 --> 00:16:18,844
we were trying to give them more personality,

321
00:16:18,864 --> 00:16:21,807
and we wanted to make certain sims seem really rude or inappropriate.

322
00:16:25,209 --> 00:16:25,309
So...

323
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:29,568
I don't know if you can see it from back there because it's very tiny.

324
00:16:29,628 --> 00:16:32,831
For all of these images, there is actually nothing going on in these animations.

325
00:16:33,511 --> 00:16:36,394
So in this case, we wanted to make it look like she was making an obscene hand gesture,

326
00:16:36,434 --> 00:16:38,616
so we put what we call a sensor grid over her hand.

327
00:16:38,996 --> 00:16:41,798
And just the sensor grid, this animation has stayed in the game,

328
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:45,561
but putting a sensor grid over it put it across the line with our players.

329
00:16:48,247 --> 00:16:50,008
Or way over the line in this case.

330
00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:53,810
So the animation itself almost made it in

331
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:55,391
because it was just kind of cheeky and silly

332
00:16:55,411 --> 00:16:56,932
and there's nothing going on.

333
00:16:57,172 --> 00:17:00,154
But you put a sensor grid on it and mm-mm.

334
00:17:01,674 --> 00:17:02,035
And nope.

335
00:17:04,216 --> 00:17:04,756
That's not happening.

336
00:17:04,776 --> 00:17:06,257
We were trying to actually put the sensor grid

337
00:17:06,277 --> 00:17:08,098
over his hands because we were trying to say

338
00:17:08,138 --> 00:17:09,379
he was typing something angry.

339
00:17:10,379 --> 00:17:12,480
And that clearly is not what anybody projected onto this.

340
00:17:17,064 --> 00:17:19,749
the last example of how powerful projection can be i was not about his

341
00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:20,250
randomness

342
00:17:21,993 --> 00:17:22,635
and your note that

343
00:17:23,136 --> 00:17:24,378
i warned you guys

344
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,983
because in the sense urinals are really exciting

345
00:17:28,206 --> 00:17:32,569
uh... so i assume everybody and knows how your own selection and logic works

346
00:17:32,769 --> 00:17:34,730
so when you're going to the restroom and you're trying to choose what you're all

347
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,691
the stand out if you're a dude

348
00:17:36,692 --> 00:17:38,893
you're basically uh... doing a very

349
00:17:39,274 --> 00:17:41,095
very private uh... thing in a

350
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:43,216
completely inappropriately public space

351
00:17:43,716 --> 00:17:46,318
so your goal is to be as far away from any other human being as possible

352
00:17:46,939 --> 00:17:47,839
uh... and if you're the first dude

353
00:17:48,219 --> 00:17:50,941
you stand in a place that allows the second dude to be as far away from you

354
00:17:50,981 --> 00:17:51,422
as possible

355
00:17:51,982 --> 00:17:54,784
uh... and so on this little binary search and everybody knows where the next two guys are gonna stand

356
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:01,922
So when we added urinals to the Sims, we wanted to get this logic in there, because we thought it would be funny.

357
00:18:02,942 --> 00:18:08,824
But that's actually really, really difficult to do in the Sims, because the objects in the Sims don't know anything about each other, and they don't actually know where they are in the world.

358
00:18:08,864 --> 00:18:13,826
So if you line up a bunch of urinals, they all exist in their own little bubble, and they don't know anything about the other urinals.

359
00:18:15,146 --> 00:18:18,727
But one of our gameplay engineers actually got this to work, and I was really excited about it.

360
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,059
and I don't know how he did it, but he got it to work

361
00:18:22,659 --> 00:18:24,320
and we were really fascinated, so we play tested it

362
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:28,640
and people acknowledged that, hey, the Sims are doing it right

363
00:18:29,681 --> 00:18:30,861
but it wasn't terribly funny

364
00:18:32,181 --> 00:18:33,682
and everybody had the same experience

365
00:18:34,122 --> 00:18:36,182
and it wasn't a story that anybody was going to tell

366
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:41,543
so in the end we took it all out and we went with something way simpler, random

367
00:18:42,443 --> 00:18:45,004
because randomly this happens and that guy's a jerk

368
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:47,359
and it's a story.

369
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,602
Or this happens, I don't know what's going on there,

370
00:18:50,202 --> 00:18:52,004
but, and I don't know who went there first,

371
00:18:52,044 --> 00:18:53,406
but it doesn't matter, either way,

372
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:55,128
it's weird and I would talk about it.

373
00:18:56,549 --> 00:18:58,631
And that, that guy in the middle

374
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:00,293
is really confused and terrified.

375
00:19:03,757 --> 00:19:05,239
And that's funny too, I really don't know

376
00:19:05,259 --> 00:19:05,879
what's going on there, but.

377
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:10,254
That looks like desperation somehow to me.

378
00:19:11,495 --> 00:19:13,516
But pretty much everything is funny in this context,

379
00:19:14,217 --> 00:19:16,218
based on your sense of etiquette and your social contract

380
00:19:16,258 --> 00:19:16,819
and sense of humor.

381
00:19:17,459 --> 00:19:19,400
And in the end, we just put random thought balloons

382
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:22,482
on it too, because almost anything is funny

383
00:19:24,084 --> 00:19:24,684
in that context.

384
00:19:24,704 --> 00:19:28,587
This might not have been random.

385
00:19:31,652 --> 00:19:34,313
Now, because The Sims is fundamentally a sandbox,

386
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:37,955
we generally try really hard not to tell the player what to do

387
00:19:38,315 --> 00:19:41,477
or to lay out specific paths or stories for them to follow.

388
00:19:41,737 --> 00:19:44,018
So on the positive side, that allows the player

389
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:47,779
a ton of flexibility and it makes the game feel really wide

390
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,921
and it supports nearly infinite replayability.

391
00:19:51,261 --> 00:19:53,162
On the downside for us, as developers,

392
00:19:53,202 --> 00:19:54,763
that means a lot of classic design patterns

393
00:19:55,603 --> 00:19:57,804
or related to goal structure or storytelling

394
00:19:57,844 --> 00:19:59,084
are kind of off limits for us.

395
00:19:59,705 --> 00:20:03,868
Now we know that the best game stories are collaborations between the player and the game

396
00:20:04,629 --> 00:20:07,411
where the player has enough agency to feel like the story belongs to them.

397
00:20:08,312 --> 00:20:11,595
So one of the places that we look for inspiration is improvisational comedy.

398
00:20:12,196 --> 00:20:13,757
In particular, the concept of yes and.

399
00:20:14,498 --> 00:20:18,881
I assume most of you are at least somewhat familiar with improv, but just in case anyone isn't, I'll explain real quick.

400
00:20:19,162 --> 00:20:22,064
The phrase yes and refers to basic philosophy in improv

401
00:20:22,425 --> 00:20:26,488
by which a participant accepts what their partner has just said, the yes.

402
00:20:26,988 --> 00:20:28,689
and then follows on from that line of thinking,

403
00:20:28,749 --> 00:20:29,770
adding to it the and.

404
00:20:31,811 --> 00:20:33,552
For example, if I say, wow, it's cold in here,

405
00:20:33,792 --> 00:20:35,113
you might acknowledge that it's cold,

406
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,614
smile all flirty-like and say something like,

407
00:20:37,974 --> 00:20:39,155
luckily I have you to keep me warm.

408
00:20:40,396 --> 00:20:41,817
And then I might acknowledge your suggestion

409
00:20:41,837 --> 00:20:42,977
that we cuddle to keep warm,

410
00:20:43,537 --> 00:20:46,119
and respond with, I thought we agreed we wouldn't do that

411
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:47,079
now that our divorce is final.

412
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,881
You're right, you're right, what would Brian think?

413
00:20:50,941 --> 00:20:52,202
So now we know that we're freezing,

414
00:20:52,342 --> 00:20:53,683
we're somewhat amicably divorced,

415
00:20:54,103 --> 00:20:55,504
and apparently one of us is dating Brian,

416
00:20:55,764 --> 00:20:56,485
and he's jealous.

417
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:58,351
and we have a story.

418
00:20:59,372 --> 00:21:01,374
There are several ways that we employ those philosophies in The Sims.

419
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:06,759
So one of the longest-lived examples of yes and in The Sims, that I'm sure

420
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,200
everybody's familiar with if you've played it, is

421
00:21:08,981 --> 00:21:10,983
what I call them autonomous feedback loops.

422
00:21:12,144 --> 00:21:14,787
There are a lot of them, but one of the clearest examples is the relationship

423
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:15,067
system.

424
00:21:16,088 --> 00:21:18,730
Relationships between Sims are represented as a value from negative

425
00:21:18,771 --> 00:21:18,811
100 to 100.

426
00:21:18,851 --> 00:21:19,331
I hate you, I like you.

427
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:25,463
We've added some complexity to them over the years, but fundamentally they're still this.

428
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:30,107
And as players perform various interactions, various directed social interactions,

429
00:21:30,567 --> 00:21:33,089
between the Sims that matrix of relationships change.

430
00:21:34,936 --> 00:21:38,598
The Sims grow to love or hate each other, get married, become enemies, and so on.

431
00:21:39,078 --> 00:21:43,280
However, the big A, small I that I mentioned, behavioral systems,

432
00:21:43,781 --> 00:21:48,543
the Sims modulate the scoring of subsequent autonomous social interactions

433
00:21:48,563 --> 00:21:52,485
that they perform on their own using their current relationship state.

434
00:21:52,765 --> 00:21:55,987
So the result is that the interactions that the Sims choose to do on their own

435
00:21:56,047 --> 00:21:58,848
inherently reflect what the player has previously directed them to do.

436
00:21:59,088 --> 00:22:01,049
But there are a bunch of other factors involved.

437
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:03,170
You can't really predict exactly what a pair of Sims are going to do.

438
00:22:04,071 --> 00:22:07,153
But if you've made them fall in love, they will do romantic loving things.

439
00:22:07,213 --> 00:22:09,434
If you've made them hate each other, they'll pick fights with each other.

440
00:22:09,834 --> 00:22:12,376
It feels like they are following your lead. Yes, and.

441
00:22:13,377 --> 00:22:17,860
And they maintain the consistency of the story that the player is telling.

442
00:22:19,569 --> 00:22:22,712
So another small example is something I call suggestive control,

443
00:22:23,432 --> 00:22:25,714
because I think it sounds naughty, but it's not really naughty.

444
00:22:27,315 --> 00:22:32,499
It's really just giving the player the opportunity to suggest a vague intent to their sim,

445
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,381
and letting the sim decide on the details.

446
00:22:34,761 --> 00:22:38,424
So the silliest example, the simplest example, is if I click on a bookcase,

447
00:22:38,564 --> 00:22:40,045
and I ask my sim to read.

448
00:22:41,665 --> 00:22:44,206
I get a picker that pops up allowing you to choose a specific book.

449
00:22:45,327 --> 00:22:47,368
Like I could pick how to seriously injure someone with this book.

450
00:22:48,168 --> 00:22:49,229
And my sim will read that book.

451
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:51,851
So just like any other interaction.

452
00:22:52,151 --> 00:22:53,872
But if instead I tell them to read something...

453
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,022
What happens is that the sim goes to the bookcase,

454
00:22:57,302 --> 00:22:58,783
and then he looks at all the books that are in the bookcase,

455
00:22:59,124 --> 00:23:01,426
and then he scores them all, big A, small I style,

456
00:23:01,806 --> 00:23:03,368
based on his personality and skills and careers

457
00:23:03,408 --> 00:23:04,408
and relationships and everything else.

458
00:23:04,669 --> 00:23:06,590
And they choose the book that they want to read.

459
00:23:07,431 --> 00:23:10,274
And it gives me a way to tease a little bit of the soul

460
00:23:10,454 --> 00:23:13,877
out of the sim, but I still am telling them what I want them

461
00:23:13,917 --> 00:23:14,157
to do.

462
00:23:15,058 --> 00:23:17,480
So it's very literally almost, yes, and.

463
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:20,863
I want you to read a book, and I'm going to read this book.

464
00:23:23,832 --> 00:23:26,413
So one last example of autonomous feedback loops is one of my favorites.

465
00:23:28,554 --> 00:23:31,134
This is not me, although it could be.

466
00:23:33,955 --> 00:23:37,776
It's very simple and it's elegant and it's subversively progressive, and I love it.

467
00:23:38,436 --> 00:23:42,778
And that involves the sim's concept of gender preference, which is our geeky way of putting it.

468
00:23:43,118 --> 00:23:45,078
The sims come out of the world having no sexual preference,

469
00:23:45,658 --> 00:23:48,939
but when the player directs their sim to initiate a romantic interaction with another sim,

470
00:23:48,979 --> 00:23:49,720
flirting, kissing...

471
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,963
whatever, the game tracks the gender of that target sim.

472
00:23:53,383 --> 00:23:57,508
Now normally, sims will not perform any autonomous romantic interactions on their own.

473
00:23:58,169 --> 00:23:59,791
Most people don't notice that, but they don't.

474
00:24:01,293 --> 00:24:05,578
But once you have initiated enough of romantic interactions with a particular gender,

475
00:24:06,339 --> 00:24:10,460
the sim will begin to autonomously romantically interact with sims of that gender on their own.

476
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,281
Yes, and.

477
00:24:13,141 --> 00:24:15,101
We actually track the preference independently for each gender,

478
00:24:15,961 --> 00:24:18,942
and it's not a binary thing, it's a continuum,

479
00:24:19,202 --> 00:24:20,282
so there's a lot of flexibility in there.

480
00:24:21,483 --> 00:24:23,143
One interesting case we had here with this is,

481
00:24:24,103 --> 00:24:25,244
this has happened more than once,

482
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:27,144
but one in particular where a congressman

483
00:24:27,884 --> 00:24:31,065
made us think about the sims being sinful or corrupting our youths.

484
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,628
It seems silly in hindsight, but...

485
00:24:35,508 --> 00:24:38,732
And he knew that that was true because he had tried the game

486
00:24:38,892 --> 00:24:41,375
and the Sims were doing all sorts of debaucherous things.

487
00:24:42,576 --> 00:24:44,879
And of course, we as developers knew that that was only happening

488
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:48,403
because he had done those debaucherous things over and over again.

489
00:24:52,716 --> 00:24:56,059
So the last example of yes and design that I want to discuss

490
00:24:56,479 --> 00:24:58,381
are wants and fears and wishes.

491
00:24:58,741 --> 00:25:00,183
I'm going to go into this in quite a bit of detail

492
00:25:00,203 --> 00:25:01,504
because I think this is something that

493
00:25:01,524 --> 00:25:02,905
can be used in a lot of contexts.

494
00:25:02,925 --> 00:25:04,266
It's definitely not sim-specific.

495
00:25:04,306 --> 00:25:05,727
My examples will be sim-specific,

496
00:25:05,768 --> 00:25:07,869
so try to generalize them in your head.

497
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:10,271
But basically, this was a mechanism

498
00:25:10,292 --> 00:25:12,453
that was initially introduced in Sims 2

499
00:25:13,494 --> 00:25:15,216
as a lightweight adaptive goal mechanism.

500
00:25:15,236 --> 00:25:16,277
I'll explain what I mean in a minute.

501
00:25:16,837 --> 00:25:19,299
Rather than a traditional prescriptive goal mechanism

502
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:19,960
like quests.

503
00:25:21,089 --> 00:25:23,830
uh... which as i mentioned because sandbox we try not to do anything like

504
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:24,010
that

505
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:27,591
now essentially the idea is that sims have things that they want and things

506
00:25:27,611 --> 00:25:28,351
that they're afraid of

507
00:25:28,672 --> 00:25:31,693
and when a sim experiences something or performs an action in the game

508
00:25:31,973 --> 00:25:32,913
either he does it or you do it

509
00:25:34,413 --> 00:25:35,854
they can have a subsequent desire

510
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:37,454
to do something in particular

511
00:25:38,315 --> 00:25:39,895
that follows from what they just did

512
00:25:40,515 --> 00:25:45,680
Now how strongly they want it is based on various factors.

513
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,322
You're gonna see a trend here,

514
00:25:47,362 --> 00:25:48,663
based like their mood, their personality,

515
00:25:48,703 --> 00:25:50,164
their skills, their relationships, so on.

516
00:25:51,025 --> 00:25:53,467
And in this case, how recently the previous event took place

517
00:25:54,268 --> 00:25:57,111
to give it a bit of temporal coherence.

518
00:25:58,132 --> 00:25:59,953
The designers can author these dependency trees

519
00:26:00,754 --> 00:26:02,336
or stories in a custom tool.

520
00:26:02,496 --> 00:26:03,577
I'll show you a bit of that in a second.

521
00:26:04,617 --> 00:26:07,138
And they're constructed out of content that's already in the game.

522
00:26:07,658 --> 00:26:10,118
Actions, states, state changes and so on.

523
00:26:10,418 --> 00:26:11,739
So there's no content added for this.

524
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:14,839
So if anybody's not familiar with it, this was the original incarnation of it,

525
00:26:14,879 --> 00:26:16,820
just to show you the information that the player actually sees.

526
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,480
So this is just the top are 4 wants that the player has,

527
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:20,900
and the bottom are 3 fears.

528
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:25,301
What the player sees is, you know, he wants to throw a party,

529
00:26:25,581 --> 00:26:26,922
he wants to become friends with this woman,

530
00:26:27,482 --> 00:26:30,422
or he's afraid of this woman dying, that's a little morbid, but fine.

531
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:32,583
He's afraid of his party going badly.

532
00:26:34,115 --> 00:26:35,860
And as I mentioned, the designers can offer these trees.

533
00:26:36,682 --> 00:26:38,187
So let's take a look at Little Timmy here.

534
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:43,944
So in our tool, each node represents a possible action

535
00:26:44,024 --> 00:26:44,485
or desire.

536
00:26:45,185 --> 00:26:46,607
Nodes with dashed outlines like this

537
00:26:47,087 --> 00:26:50,490
will never be shown to the player as an explicit desire.

538
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:53,112
But if they're satisfied, they will enable subsequent things.

539
00:26:53,132 --> 00:26:55,434
So they're like a hidden trigger, almost.

540
00:26:56,095 --> 00:26:59,017
So let's say the player has Timmy stargaze.

541
00:26:59,277 --> 00:27:00,819
Again, Timmy's not asking to stargaze.

542
00:27:00,939 --> 00:27:02,100
But let's say the player has him do it.

543
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,841
Stargazing in The Sims is an interaction

544
00:27:03,861 --> 00:27:05,823
where the Sim lies on the ground outdoors at night

545
00:27:05,963 --> 00:27:07,244
and just kind of gazes at the night sky.

546
00:27:08,345 --> 00:27:09,985
But let's say he has him stargaze.

547
00:27:10,725 --> 00:27:12,405
Now all of a sudden Timmy wants a telescope.

548
00:27:13,426 --> 00:27:14,026
So you buy him one.

549
00:27:15,646 --> 00:27:17,066
Now Timmy wants to use the telescope,

550
00:27:18,166 --> 00:27:19,467
so I direct him to do just that.

551
00:27:20,307 --> 00:27:21,507
And maybe now Timmy's inspired

552
00:27:21,827 --> 00:27:23,427
and he wants to discover a planet.

553
00:27:24,888 --> 00:27:26,268
And maybe he's afraid of his telescope breaking

554
00:27:26,288 --> 00:27:27,148
because he's kind of grateful

555
00:27:27,168 --> 00:27:28,448
that you bought him one, they're really expensive.

556
00:27:29,428 --> 00:27:30,789
And if he eventually discovers a planet,

557
00:27:30,809 --> 00:27:33,109
which happens by repeatedly scanning the night sky

558
00:27:33,129 --> 00:27:34,129
with his shiny new telescope,

559
00:27:34,449 --> 00:27:35,729
maybe he wants to join the science career.

560
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:37,110
So you do that for him.

561
00:27:38,327 --> 00:27:40,731
now what's the by a chess table but logic skill get promoted

562
00:27:41,592 --> 00:27:43,135
and still obsessed with that telescope breaking

563
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,358
really important to him because he's had since he was a kid

564
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,803
uh... and then when little to me finally does get promoted a couple of times

565
00:27:49,164 --> 00:27:50,346
he decides he wants to be an astronaut

566
00:27:51,548 --> 00:27:54,709
Now that's a story, but the game didn't force you down that path at all.

567
00:27:55,169 --> 00:27:58,291
And you chose to have Tommy stargaze one night when he was young.

568
00:27:58,651 --> 00:28:01,552
He asked for a telescope, which is cute, but you didn't have to buy it for him.

569
00:28:01,832 --> 00:28:04,814
But because you did, he had a dream to discover a new planet and

570
00:28:04,834 --> 00:28:05,674
to become an astronaut.

571
00:28:06,374 --> 00:28:08,675
Timmy wanted those things, and you made it happen for him.

572
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:10,696
You told that story, step by step.

573
00:28:11,997 --> 00:28:13,678
But if you had decided not to buy that telescope,

574
00:28:15,499 --> 00:28:17,880
because you didn't have the money, or maybe you never stargazed at all,

575
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:19,960
none of that would have happened.

576
00:28:21,428 --> 00:28:26,290
And to be honest, you would never even know that Tommy had this latent desire to be an astronaut.

577
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,991
You just would have never found out.

578
00:28:30,533 --> 00:28:36,816
So it's pretty powerful, but the very yes and nature of it meant that it's difficult to surface long-term goals.

579
00:28:37,376 --> 00:28:43,059
Because basically it's just little short-term things that come after something else happens.

580
00:28:43,499 --> 00:28:47,221
So we gave the player the ability to make promises to their Sims.

581
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:50,094
So that allows us to do things like here you can see,

582
00:28:51,014 --> 00:28:52,355
as soon as he wants to discover a planet,

583
00:28:53,316 --> 00:28:54,516
we can have him say, you know,

584
00:28:54,537 --> 00:28:56,318
I really wanna be an astronaut someday,

585
00:28:56,758 --> 00:28:57,758
and that's way more powerful.

586
00:28:58,619 --> 00:28:59,940
But the problem is being an astronaut

587
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,320
is a really long-term goal in The Sims,

588
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,741
it's gonna take you a couple hours to get there.

589
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:04,642
So if we surface that right away,

590
00:29:05,063 --> 00:29:06,383
this whole thing kinda stalls out.

591
00:29:07,304 --> 00:29:10,306
But what we allow is that now the player can promise

592
00:29:11,345 --> 00:29:14,527
When Timmy says, I want to be an astronaut, you can say, I promise I'm going to get you that.

593
00:29:14,707 --> 00:29:15,668
I'm going to do that for you.

594
00:29:16,148 --> 00:29:18,950
And then Timmy recognizes that you promised it, even though you haven't done it yet.

595
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:22,632
And then it acts as if it was satisfied,

596
00:29:23,652 --> 00:29:26,894
so that the subsequent desires can show up.

597
00:29:26,934 --> 00:29:30,116
And Timmy can help you make him an astronaut.

598
00:29:30,376 --> 00:29:32,497
He can suggest the same things, but in a different order.

599
00:29:32,797 --> 00:29:35,939
And it feels even more like a back and forth between the player and the sim.

600
00:29:40,013 --> 00:29:42,515
So I want to go through a couple of examples. I don't know if everybody can see these from back there.

601
00:29:43,436 --> 00:29:47,239
But essentially, these are trees that were actually in the game.

602
00:29:47,479 --> 00:29:51,422
So this is a tree for a romance sim, which is our ridiculous word for promiscuous sim,

603
00:29:51,522 --> 00:29:52,883
because we can't say promiscuous.

604
00:29:53,263 --> 00:29:54,664
So this is a sim who likes to get around.

605
00:29:55,425 --> 00:29:56,906
So that starting node, the bold one there,

606
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:59,928
remember the dashed ones are things the player doesn't actually see.

607
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:02,831
These are things that we're tracking in the background and if they happen to happen,

608
00:30:03,211 --> 00:30:04,432
subsequent things will arise.

609
00:30:04,692 --> 00:30:06,694
So in this case, if you have him make out with a new sim,

610
00:30:07,754 --> 00:30:09,055
He's going to want to woohoo in a hot tub.

611
00:30:09,235 --> 00:30:11,396
Woohoo is, if you don't know, a sim for sex.

612
00:30:11,416 --> 00:30:13,697
So he's going to want to have sex in a hot tub, have sex in bed,

613
00:30:14,017 --> 00:30:16,498
and he's going to want to meet somebody new, because he's promiscuous.

614
00:30:17,338 --> 00:30:21,240
And then, he's not asking, but if you have him have sex with a second sim,

615
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:24,221
and then you have him have sex with a third sim,

616
00:30:25,582 --> 00:30:27,643
he recognizes that you're playing him as promiscuous.

617
00:30:28,523 --> 00:30:29,804
And then he says I want to break up with my spouse.

618
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:31,245
If he has one.

619
00:30:31,966 --> 00:30:33,126
And he wants to have sex in public.

620
00:30:33,567 --> 00:30:35,688
And he's afraid of being rejected for having sex in public.

621
00:30:36,309 --> 00:30:38,290
And if for some reason you roll with this,

622
00:30:38,671 --> 00:30:40,492
and you do have him woohoo in public,

623
00:30:41,193 --> 00:30:42,113
then he wants to do it three times.

624
00:30:45,015 --> 00:30:48,558
These aren't even trees, but this is basically an example

625
00:30:49,659 --> 00:30:51,821
of a sim with commitment issues.

626
00:30:52,201 --> 00:30:54,583
If you have him marry someone, he immediately wants to meet someone new.

627
00:30:56,277 --> 00:30:57,798
uh... is in his just i don't know

628
00:30:58,258 --> 00:31:02,180
uh... if you have the phone love with the news with the sam they're afraid

629
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:02,720
they're gonna die

630
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,841
that did that same is going to die

631
00:31:06,202 --> 00:31:07,562
and it kind of another sad example

632
00:31:07,863 --> 00:31:11,504
is someone's kids so badly if social work it takes away their child uh...

633
00:31:11,524 --> 00:31:12,545
immediately just one have a ticket

634
00:31:13,625 --> 00:31:14,486
which should be legal but

635
00:31:14,966 --> 00:31:16,106
it's it's the sense uh...

636
00:31:16,727 --> 00:31:20,108
and those are very simple but they can get crazy these are trees are actually a

637
00:31:20,148 --> 00:31:21,669
lot more like this than like those little ones

638
00:31:22,109 --> 00:31:23,470
on they can have kind of any structure

639
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,961
So I want to go into a bit of more detail on how this all works, because I think it's very important.

640
00:31:30,781 --> 00:31:37,223
So on the surface these feel like quest chains, but there's several significant differences that make them kind of special.

641
00:31:37,703 --> 00:31:40,844
So first of all, the players have no knowledge of these trees.

642
00:31:41,224 --> 00:31:46,366
So they're never presented in the UI, and players never explicitly choose to follow them.

643
00:31:47,066 --> 00:31:51,247
It's nothing like that. In fact, even the Sims themselves do not technically realize they're on any of these trees,

644
00:31:51,287 --> 00:31:53,148
because they're not, and I'll explain in more detail.

645
00:31:54,188 --> 00:31:57,189
all the possible stories are evaluated in parallel.

646
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:00,110
And in the case in these examples,

647
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:01,951
we're part of hundreds of trees that

648
00:32:01,971 --> 00:32:05,633
were authored by the team with tens of thousands of nodes

649
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:05,893
in them.

650
00:32:06,493 --> 00:32:07,754
But each tree is manageable.

651
00:32:08,494 --> 00:32:09,795
But they're all evaluated in parallel.

652
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:14,012
And everything that the sim experiences, events, actions,

653
00:32:14,172 --> 00:32:17,713
what have you, satisfies every copy of the associated node

654
00:32:17,733 --> 00:32:18,694
in every tree in the game.

655
00:32:19,254 --> 00:32:20,815
And remember, there's no concept of being on a tree.

656
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:22,155
The trees are just sequences of events

657
00:32:22,555 --> 00:32:24,176
and actions to be pattern matched against.

658
00:32:25,617 --> 00:32:27,757
And then every subsequent next node

659
00:32:28,058 --> 00:32:29,338
that follows from a completed node

660
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:32,039
is scored and considered simultaneously

661
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:34,260
as a potential desire or goal to be surfaced to the player.

662
00:32:35,807 --> 00:32:37,748
So let's look at an abstract example.

663
00:32:37,788 --> 00:32:40,169
So here are several possible story trees.

664
00:32:40,629 --> 00:32:42,210
These are just like the trees that we looked at before.

665
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,691
They could have anything in them.

666
00:32:44,711 --> 00:32:46,732
Maybe a couple of them are romance-oriented trees.

667
00:32:46,752 --> 00:32:47,892
A couple of them are family-oriented.

668
00:32:47,913 --> 00:32:48,393
It doesn't matter.

669
00:32:49,433 --> 00:32:50,774
And let's imagine that each of these trees

670
00:32:50,834 --> 00:32:53,595
has a meet someone new node at the start of it.

671
00:32:56,316 --> 00:32:58,897
Now as I mentioned, as a sim experiences events and actions,

672
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:00,498
nodes are satisfied starting at the root.

673
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:05,560
So when a sim meets someone new, like say Sarah in this case.

674
00:33:07,071 --> 00:33:07,171
uh...

675
00:33:08,272 --> 00:33:10,193
every node that says meet someone new

676
00:33:10,573 --> 00:33:11,214
that is available

677
00:33:11,234 --> 00:33:12,554
uh... in every tree

678
00:33:12,955 --> 00:33:13,395
in any tree

679
00:33:13,795 --> 00:33:14,496
uh... is satisfied

680
00:33:14,936 --> 00:33:18,058
and that enables these downstream nodes in every possible tree to be surfaced

681
00:33:18,118 --> 00:33:20,339
and subsequent as subsequent desires to the sims

682
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:23,421
now every possible next all those gray nodes

683
00:33:23,761 --> 00:33:24,682
are scored and ranked

684
00:33:26,023 --> 00:33:27,745
back to that pattern, big A, small I style

685
00:33:28,065 --> 00:33:30,969
against their personality, relationships and so on

686
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:32,551
in a big pile.

687
00:33:32,931 --> 00:33:34,553
And the highest scoring, most relevant desires

688
00:33:35,374 --> 00:33:38,238
are represented as the Sims wants or wishes or desires.

689
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:41,362
And it does not matter what tree they're in.

690
00:33:46,054 --> 00:33:47,496
One thing that we did discover early on,

691
00:33:48,397 --> 00:33:50,039
hop back a second, one thing that we did discover early on

692
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,383
was that temporal tuning, like I mentioned,

693
00:33:53,423 --> 00:33:54,765
like these nodes are a part of the scoring,

694
00:33:54,805 --> 00:33:57,608
is also how long it's been since that previous node was satisfied.

695
00:33:57,908 --> 00:34:00,031
Basically, the scores decay the longer it's been.

696
00:34:00,852 --> 00:34:04,895
we realized that we needed to score those or needed to know is based on the

697
00:34:04,935 --> 00:34:09,559
players memory and not our expectations in the real world or even our

698
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,142
expectations in our simulated world so for example of the Sims spouse dies.

699
00:34:14,063 --> 00:34:17,706
We might surface that desire for a week of game time even that seems short,

700
00:34:18,066 --> 00:34:21,309
but it's a week of game time because of their spouse just died that's crazy

701
00:34:21,349 --> 00:34:24,391
it should that it would that's a story he should worry about it he should be

702
00:34:24,431 --> 00:34:26,753
morning or maybe even having a fear of falling in love again.

703
00:34:27,754 --> 00:34:30,256
But the player moves on way, way faster than that.

704
00:34:30,616 --> 00:34:32,477
Right? I'm sure my wife died yesterday,

705
00:34:32,577 --> 00:34:34,479
but that was yesterday. Today I want a hot tub

706
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:35,399
and I want to get laid.

707
00:34:37,261 --> 00:34:38,782
So, uh...

708
00:34:40,903 --> 00:34:43,165
So then, like I said, this is,

709
00:34:43,185 --> 00:34:44,486
this is just an example of that tuning.

710
00:34:44,726 --> 00:34:46,387
So you can see here a little bit of how we balance

711
00:34:46,847 --> 00:34:47,648
the various factors.

712
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:52,491
Now maybe a couple of those stories actually have

713
00:34:52,571 --> 00:34:53,692
flirty introduction up next.

714
00:34:56,197 --> 00:34:59,338
So then when that happens, those trees advance and new gray nodes

715
00:35:00,078 --> 00:35:01,439
are opened up.

716
00:35:02,399 --> 00:35:04,780
And they're all thrown, like I said, into a big stew and they're all evaluated

717
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,721
against each other and the highest growing nodes are surfaced.

718
00:35:08,162 --> 00:35:08,642
And so on.

719
00:35:10,143 --> 00:35:10,563
And so on.

720
00:35:13,081 --> 00:35:16,024
and all of the gray next and all possible stories are evaluated and that

721
00:35:16,064 --> 00:35:17,305
could mean that the sim is hopping

722
00:35:17,966 --> 00:35:19,127
from story to story

723
00:35:19,628 --> 00:35:22,290
uh... but really they're just organically choosing whatever desires

724
00:35:22,351 --> 00:35:26,235
make the most sense on the total given the totality of that sims experience at

725
00:35:26,275 --> 00:35:29,498
any given moment and because of that temporal connectivity whatever the sims

726
00:35:29,538 --> 00:35:29,738
want

727
00:35:30,339 --> 00:35:34,341
will organically make sense to the player and will build a story.

728
00:35:34,601 --> 00:35:39,785
So a player could happen to accidentally wander very clearly down one tree behind the scenes.

729
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:41,986
They won't know that. They're just going to think everything makes sense.

730
00:35:42,126 --> 00:35:44,188
And it's yes and, yes and, yes and.

731
00:35:45,028 --> 00:35:48,331
Or they could end up hopping to another tree unwittingly

732
00:35:49,271 --> 00:35:55,335
because the and made more sense than the and in the tree that they maybe were following behind the scenes.

733
00:35:59,424 --> 00:36:00,905
So the next big area that I want to get to

734
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:05,449
deals with something larger than that moment-to-moment

735
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:06,650
that we've been going through.

736
00:36:07,571 --> 00:36:10,373
And that is that we also do sort of coarse,

737
00:36:10,694 --> 00:36:12,835
chunky, higher-level simulations all over the place,

738
00:36:13,636 --> 00:36:15,558
often to make the larger world feel coherent.

739
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:17,419
So traditionally in The Sims,

740
00:36:17,439 --> 00:36:19,661
your house or your lot has existed in isolation.

741
00:36:20,322 --> 00:36:20,882
You're in a bubble.

742
00:36:21,543 --> 00:36:23,685
Your Sims lives go on, but outside your lot,

743
00:36:24,165 --> 00:36:24,966
it's pretty much frozen.

744
00:36:25,426 --> 00:36:28,467
Now, Sims 3 introduced the concept of a continuous, seamless world.

745
00:36:29,407 --> 00:36:32,768
And that introduced the problem for us in that we wanted the entire world to feel alive

746
00:36:32,788 --> 00:36:37,108
and everybody to be doing things, but we couldn't simulate 100 or 200 Sims, so we needed another

747
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:37,549
solution.

748
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:41,249
And what we arrived at was something we called story progression.

749
00:36:41,909 --> 00:36:49,711
And basically, the Sims that you can't see are running a really chunky simulation that

750
00:36:49,751 --> 00:36:51,431
progresses their lives as you play.

751
00:36:52,445 --> 00:36:54,467
the and uh... it allows us to do things

752
00:36:54,927 --> 00:36:56,548
uh... like have the entire world grow up

753
00:36:57,169 --> 00:37:00,071
uh... and main coherence what mean coherent in your story

754
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:01,812
so you can have a childhood sweetheart

755
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:05,215
uh... their childhood friend who becomes your high school sweetheart

756
00:37:05,555 --> 00:37:07,276
on the at marriage and together you have kids

757
00:37:07,296 --> 00:37:10,278
uh... and you can still go back and visit the grandparents in the house you

758
00:37:10,318 --> 00:37:10,679
grew up in

759
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:12,500
and they will be in fact grandparents

760
00:37:13,515 --> 00:37:14,195
and not children.

761
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:18,818
The system, again, the same trend,

762
00:37:19,158 --> 00:37:20,919
the system is like a big macro version

763
00:37:20,939 --> 00:37:22,841
of the big A small I behavior that I described,

764
00:37:23,081 --> 00:37:24,822
but rather than looking around the world

765
00:37:25,102 --> 00:37:27,183
for interactions on objects,

766
00:37:28,164 --> 00:37:29,345
the system looks at each sim

767
00:37:29,505 --> 00:37:32,387
and scores possible life events that could happen to them,

768
00:37:32,627 --> 00:37:35,348
like get a job, be promoted, have a child,

769
00:37:35,509 --> 00:37:36,649
get married, things like that.

770
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:40,632
And we score all of those interactions based on various factors related to the sim,

771
00:37:40,872 --> 00:37:43,573
like their age and the standard personality and so on.

772
00:37:44,314 --> 00:37:45,254
And then we choose the best one.

773
00:37:46,235 --> 00:37:49,296
The one that makes most sense to be the next big life event for that sim.

774
00:37:52,254 --> 00:37:54,336
and we score all of those interactions based on

775
00:37:55,257 --> 00:37:57,239
various factors related to... sorry, blah blah blah.

776
00:37:57,419 --> 00:37:58,460
Then we make the action true

777
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:02,103
by changing the macro state of the sim. And actually, there have been a couple people

778
00:38:02,183 --> 00:38:04,585
talked about this already in other narrative talks or something similar.

779
00:38:05,666 --> 00:38:07,868
If we choose the sim to be a policeman,

780
00:38:09,069 --> 00:38:11,711
we skip the formalities and we just make them a policeman.

781
00:38:12,592 --> 00:38:15,797
uh... if we choose them to get married there's a ceremony uh... which cheaper

782
00:38:15,817 --> 00:38:18,200
uh... we just make them now married

783
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,242
uh... and so on

784
00:38:19,842 --> 00:38:22,286
and the magic such as it is

785
00:38:22,747 --> 00:38:24,589
most of the local interactions of the sims perform

786
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:29,172
like working out on a treadmill or reading books or making out or whatever

787
00:38:29,512 --> 00:38:33,374
are all scored based on that sim state. So by manipulating the sim states directly

788
00:38:33,574 --> 00:38:36,316
in this big macro way, the actual interactions that they take

789
00:38:36,796 --> 00:38:40,178
when you are visiting them or when you see them will probably make sense.

790
00:38:40,498 --> 00:38:44,280
So if we've made a sim a musician, when you visit them they'll probably be playing the piano

791
00:38:44,841 --> 00:38:47,602
or the guitar or whatever. And as they get promoted,

792
00:38:48,463 --> 00:38:50,244
big chunky promotions that they didn't really earn.

793
00:38:51,055 --> 00:38:52,716
because life isn't fair if you're not looking,

794
00:38:53,457 --> 00:38:55,478
then we'll automatically bump his skill up

795
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:57,640
to make it all coherent or consistent

796
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,421
and make it make sense.

797
00:38:58,661 --> 00:39:00,202
So when you come back a couple days later,

798
00:39:00,242 --> 00:39:01,663
your sim has evolved and grown

799
00:39:02,444 --> 00:39:04,265
and they'll be playing more sophisticated music,

800
00:39:04,325 --> 00:39:05,906
making fewer mistakes, and so on.

801
00:39:06,367 --> 00:39:09,209
Everything stays internally and contextually consistent.

802
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:13,934
uh... and as an added bonus uh... we can alter the scoring of those life events

803
00:39:13,994 --> 00:39:14,354
globally

804
00:39:15,015 --> 00:39:16,336
uh... to do sneaky things

805
00:39:16,777 --> 00:39:20,380
like increase the chance of people moving in or increase the fertility rate

806
00:39:20,901 --> 00:39:22,462
uh... so babies are born faster

807
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:24,384
uh... if the population has gotten too low

808
00:39:25,005 --> 00:39:28,328
uh... and at the opposite of the spectrum uh... if we have too many people

809
00:39:28,829 --> 00:39:29,229
in town

810
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:31,352
we can just start killing people off uh...

811
00:39:32,232 --> 00:39:34,973
Or I guess in the most creepy way, if a player decides to have a baby

812
00:39:35,674 --> 00:39:39,515
and the town is full, then someone across town just quietly dies

813
00:39:40,676 --> 00:39:42,937
to make room. Complete with a backstory.

814
00:39:43,197 --> 00:39:44,998
Like, the person who dies, they deserved it.

815
00:39:45,198 --> 00:39:47,639
They scored the highest on likely to die.

816
00:39:48,059 --> 00:39:48,799
So it's all okay.

817
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,021
So what I want to show you here...

818
00:39:53,665 --> 00:39:56,846
is actually a prototype that we built.

819
00:39:56,866 --> 00:39:57,707
Actually, the person who built it

820
00:39:57,767 --> 00:39:58,907
is sitting back there somewhere, Ray.

821
00:40:01,528 --> 00:40:06,491
So this is a prototype of that story progression system,

822
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:07,611
an abstract prototype.

823
00:40:07,631 --> 00:40:08,992
So what you're looking at here is a town,

824
00:40:09,372 --> 00:40:10,673
and every orange box is a house,

825
00:40:11,813 --> 00:40:13,274
and every yellow rectangle is a sim.

826
00:40:14,314 --> 00:40:15,495
And what you're seeing is them moving in,

827
00:40:16,435 --> 00:40:17,916
the lines are them forming relationships,

828
00:40:18,436 --> 00:40:21,198
falling in love, becoming enemies.

829
00:40:22,262 --> 00:40:24,424
uh... you'll see people in the old but it may be moving together

830
00:40:24,865 --> 00:40:26,606
they'll have kids and we can zoom in here and look at

831
00:40:27,267 --> 00:40:28,168
one of them for a quick

832
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:32,431
through the bubble and mara

833
00:40:33,618 --> 00:40:37,440
and Madison. Bubba is all about popularity. He's outgoing and a good cook and a good kisser.

834
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:42,561
He's a catch. Well, he's a grocer, but that'll have to do. And then Mara, she's also about

835
00:40:42,581 --> 00:40:47,123
popularity. She hates the outdoors. She's always late and she's a waiter. And that's

836
00:40:47,143 --> 00:40:51,624
their daughter Madison. She will be a romance sim. She's a fast reader and a horrible cook,

837
00:40:51,644 --> 00:40:52,544
so she didn't get that from dad.

838
00:40:56,377 --> 00:40:57,057
What's going on here?

839
00:40:57,778 --> 00:40:59,120
This is Bubba's life story.

840
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,042
This is everything that's happened to Bubba

841
00:41:01,082 --> 00:41:01,703
while you weren't looking.

842
00:41:03,204 --> 00:41:05,427
And if we zoom in here a little bit and look more closely,

843
00:41:06,148 --> 00:41:08,751
we can see all the things that happened to Bubba in this thing.

844
00:41:09,011 --> 00:41:10,212
So one of the first things that happened to Bubba

845
00:41:10,233 --> 00:41:10,933
was he met Mara.

846
00:41:11,954 --> 00:41:12,956
So that's great.

847
00:41:14,057 --> 00:41:15,899
And then he became friends with Mara pretty quickly.

848
00:41:17,247 --> 00:41:18,628
uh... and then he fell in love with mara

849
00:41:19,509 --> 00:41:20,510
before she fell in love with him

850
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:21,051
but

851
00:41:21,991 --> 00:41:23,153
but she came in a long time

852
00:41:23,393 --> 00:41:24,894
and then uh... mara proposed to baba

853
00:41:25,095 --> 00:41:26,096
a few a little while later

854
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:29,239
and then after a lengthy seven-day engagement

855
00:41:30,019 --> 00:41:30,540
they got married

856
00:41:32,373 --> 00:41:34,574
after they moved in together, but no judging.

857
00:41:35,014 --> 00:41:37,416
And then they had a daughter, Madison,

858
00:41:38,017 --> 00:41:39,218
and then they had to move to a bigger house.

859
00:41:40,258 --> 00:41:41,879
But this is all that's happening behind the scenes.

860
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:43,300
They happen very infrequently.

861
00:41:43,441 --> 00:41:44,201
It's really, really cheap.

862
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:46,463
We could do this for hundreds or maybe thousands of Sims.

863
00:41:46,903 --> 00:41:48,504
I mean, what that means is that if you knew Bubba

864
00:41:48,965 --> 00:41:51,106
or you knew Mara, you would eventually be,

865
00:41:51,186 --> 00:41:52,247
you would see them together

866
00:41:52,387 --> 00:41:54,228
and you would eventually be going to a different house

867
00:41:54,449 --> 00:41:55,830
and then eventually they would have a daughter

868
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:57,491
and it would just make sense.

869
00:42:10,248 --> 00:42:15,570
So one more example of sort of what I call meta storytelling

870
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:17,711
is inverse autonomy.

871
00:42:17,731 --> 00:42:18,652
And I'll explain what I mean by that.

872
00:42:19,372 --> 00:42:21,793
While story progression ensures that the individual NPC

873
00:42:21,813 --> 00:42:23,494
sims and families remain consistent over time,

874
00:42:23,934 --> 00:42:26,035
another system that I call inverse autonomy, this system,

875
00:42:26,135 --> 00:42:28,216
ensures that the world itself is appropriately populated

876
00:42:28,256 --> 00:42:29,077
by NPCs.

877
00:42:29,557 --> 00:42:30,937
So essentially, this system makes sure

878
00:42:30,977 --> 00:42:32,558
that when a player visits a public space,

879
00:42:33,098 --> 00:42:35,580
like a restaurant or a gym, other sims

880
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:36,380
just happen to be there.

881
00:42:37,461 --> 00:42:40,285
And moreover, it attempts to maintain narrative appropriateness.

882
00:42:40,966 --> 00:42:45,493
And what I mean by that is that specific sims that are in a particular place, like a gym or a restaurant,

883
00:42:45,533 --> 00:42:48,757
are the sims that the player would expect to be there based on the story they're telling

884
00:42:49,038 --> 00:42:50,720
and the things that have happened in their world so far.

885
00:42:52,062 --> 00:42:54,844
does this by scoring sims in the world

886
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:57,346
against their appropriateness for a given venue.

887
00:42:57,386 --> 00:43:00,469
Very big A, small I like, but in reverse.

888
00:43:00,769 --> 00:43:02,650
So instead of the sims looking for things to do,

889
00:43:03,071 --> 00:43:04,952
we look at the sims and say this sim

890
00:43:04,972 --> 00:43:06,894
would be the perfect sim to be here at the gym.

891
00:43:07,134 --> 00:43:08,875
So if I've made friends with a professional athlete,

892
00:43:08,915 --> 00:43:10,036
it'd be cool if he was at the gym.

893
00:43:10,336 --> 00:43:11,397
That will make total sense to me.

894
00:43:12,478 --> 00:43:15,000
And if I've met someone who's a bookworm,

895
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:16,221
it'd be great if they were at the library.

896
00:43:19,915 --> 00:43:23,639
And the last example of, that I want to get into,

897
00:43:25,161 --> 00:43:26,302
is a pattern that I call N of M,

898
00:43:26,442 --> 00:43:27,483
which is not a very clever name,

899
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:29,305
but you'll see what I mean by that.

900
00:43:29,765 --> 00:43:30,686
And it's really about creating

901
00:43:30,726 --> 00:43:32,148
interesting narrative opportunities

902
00:43:32,408 --> 00:43:34,550
by giving the player multiple ways to succeed.

903
00:43:35,832 --> 00:43:36,813
By giving the player options,

904
00:43:37,714 --> 00:43:38,915
they can choose to tell their story,

905
00:43:39,195 --> 00:43:41,958
their own story, of their unique path to success.

906
00:43:43,216 --> 00:43:47,378
Now, ideally the success criteria are not simple, discrete yes-no checkboxes.

907
00:43:47,898 --> 00:43:50,779
Even things like bring me 10 apples is still a checkbox,

908
00:43:50,879 --> 00:43:53,600
because I can't bring you 8 apples and get half credit.

909
00:43:54,801 --> 00:43:59,583
So, and that's, these non-discrete goals are interesting

910
00:43:59,623 --> 00:44:01,464
because they allow the player a lot more flexibility

911
00:44:01,484 --> 00:44:06,806
and there's a lot more success space and more room for player agency in their story.

912
00:44:07,546 --> 00:44:09,748
So, this is a really simplistic abstract example,

913
00:44:10,108 --> 00:44:12,170
but let's say that I need 100 points to achieve a goal in the game.

914
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:16,193
Now maybe there are three sub-goals that each can be completed at any level between 0 and 100.

915
00:44:18,188 --> 00:44:20,689
The player could go all in on one and ignore the others,

916
00:44:21,089 --> 00:44:22,350
which would satisfy the parent goal.

917
00:44:24,431 --> 00:44:26,492
Or they could go wide across all the sub-goals,

918
00:44:26,792 --> 00:44:27,953
but not completely.

919
00:44:28,193 --> 00:44:29,714
They could just partially do all of them.

920
00:44:30,494 --> 00:44:32,095
And that would still count, because it adds up to 100.

921
00:44:32,235 --> 00:44:34,536
Now, the best example, and I apologize

922
00:44:34,576 --> 00:44:37,298
these images are a little fuzzy because they're very tiny

923
00:44:37,518 --> 00:44:39,959
normally, is the Sims 3 career.

924
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:45,881
system. So in this example, you might start out in the culinary career as a

925
00:44:45,941 --> 00:44:48,842
kitchen scullion and your only requirements for success are your

926
00:44:48,882 --> 00:44:51,662
cooking skill and the mood you're in when you go to work. So you can decide to

927
00:44:51,682 --> 00:44:55,663
go all in on cooking skill and practice cooking all day and then and not worry

928
00:44:55,683 --> 00:44:58,164
about the mood you're in. Maybe the cooking, if you're practicing cooking all

929
00:44:58,204 --> 00:45:01,045
day it takes so long you can't, you don't have time to shower and you don't have

930
00:45:01,065 --> 00:45:04,105
time to sleep so you're you're falling asleep and you stink all day and

931
00:45:04,145 --> 00:45:07,506
whatever but it doesn't matter because you're an amazing cook. I think there's

932
00:45:07,546 --> 00:45:08,406
a reality show about that.

933
00:45:11,091 --> 00:45:12,892
Now when you get promoted, we might add a metric,

934
00:45:13,193 --> 00:45:14,554
say your relationship with your boss.

935
00:45:14,994 --> 00:45:16,956
So you could continue trying to be an awesome cook,

936
00:45:16,976 --> 00:45:17,776
but that was a lot of work.

937
00:45:18,817 --> 00:45:20,659
So you could decide to just also build

938
00:45:20,699 --> 00:45:21,740
a relationship with your boss.

939
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:24,662
And you could decide you're gonna keep learning to cook

940
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:25,743
because it's only fair,

941
00:45:26,464 --> 00:45:27,885
and you're gonna be your boss's best friend.

942
00:45:28,385 --> 00:45:30,147
Or you could say, screw that cooking thing,

943
00:45:30,347 --> 00:45:31,508
I'm gonna date my boss,

944
00:45:32,188 --> 00:45:33,790
and maybe I'm gonna marry my boss,

945
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:35,911
so I don't have to worry about any of this crap anymore,

946
00:45:35,971 --> 00:45:36,892
because I'm married to the boss.

947
00:45:39,752 --> 00:45:45,875
And then maybe we add one more, and we give you the ability to have relationships with

948
00:45:45,895 --> 00:45:46,456
your co-workers.

949
00:45:46,776 --> 00:45:49,297
Now if you're married to the boss, maybe you don't care about this at all, because you're

950
00:45:49,317 --> 00:45:49,818
already golden.

951
00:45:50,298 --> 00:45:51,218
You don't have to work at all.

952
00:45:51,979 --> 00:45:55,601
But if you weren't married to your boss, then you could decide to throw a party every couple

953
00:45:55,621 --> 00:45:58,462
days for your co-workers, and also not worry about any of that other stuff.

954
00:45:58,982 --> 00:46:02,884
Or you could casually socialize with the co-workers you like, and you could keep practicing your

955
00:46:02,904 --> 00:46:03,325
cooking skill.

956
00:46:07,656 --> 00:46:12,045
And then to make it more interesting, we do something, I have pretentious names for everything,

957
00:46:12,927 --> 00:46:15,913
that I call perturbing the strategic landscape.

958
00:46:18,318 --> 00:46:18,438
The...

959
00:46:19,562 --> 00:46:23,744
Basically we wait for you, the player, to have a plan and to start executing on it

960
00:46:24,324 --> 00:46:25,345
and then we change the rules

961
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:27,786
because we're dicks, I mentioned that.

962
00:46:29,246 --> 00:46:31,567
In the career example, let's say you did choose to marry your boss

963
00:46:32,228 --> 00:46:33,628
and you let all the other metrics slide,

964
00:46:34,108 --> 00:46:36,569
then a couple of career levels up the ladder,

965
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:38,250
we change who your boss is.

966
00:46:39,815 --> 00:46:42,278
Now, we didn't do that because you married your boss.

967
00:46:42,578 --> 00:46:43,959
We were gonna do that anyway, right?

968
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:44,961
So if you weren't married to your boss,

969
00:46:45,001 --> 00:46:46,242
that's just a footnote.

970
00:46:46,402 --> 00:46:47,483
Hey, I got a new boss, that's cool.

971
00:46:48,224 --> 00:46:50,506
But if you were married to your boss, now you're screwed.

972
00:46:50,666 --> 00:46:52,248
Like you're married, I hope you were in love

973
00:46:52,528 --> 00:46:53,429
because that's all you got.

974
00:46:54,570 --> 00:46:58,112
you have to scramble to figure out real quick how am I going to get good at cooking or how am I going to,

975
00:46:58,252 --> 00:47:03,473
you know, throw a big party for my co-workers or whatnot because you have to catch up.

976
00:47:03,793 --> 00:47:07,675
Now we didn't write a story for you, but we set you up to experience one.

977
00:47:08,175 --> 00:47:11,156
It's your story and we just made it more likely that you'd tell a good one.

978
00:47:14,062 --> 00:47:17,963
So in summary, empathy is extremely powerful.

979
00:47:18,183 --> 00:47:19,023
I think everybody knows that.

980
00:47:19,704 --> 00:47:23,485
And relatability makes empathy much more possible.

981
00:47:24,005 --> 00:47:26,285
If players can relate to your world and your characters,

982
00:47:27,126 --> 00:47:30,986
even uncurated, possibly random stories will resonate.

983
00:47:31,867 --> 00:47:33,367
Projection is extremely powerful.

984
00:47:34,427 --> 00:47:36,328
And your players want to find meaning in everything.

985
00:47:37,048 --> 00:47:38,028
Again, even random.

986
00:47:38,088 --> 00:47:39,029
They're looking for patterns

987
00:47:39,049 --> 00:47:39,949
and they're looking for meaning.

988
00:47:40,309 --> 00:47:41,049
Take advantage of that.

989
00:47:41,469 --> 00:47:43,010
And give them the benefit of the doubt

990
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:43,610
and give them room.

991
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:45,152
uh...

992
00:47:46,034 --> 00:47:49,182
follow your players lead like your players are trying to tell a story

993
00:47:50,224 --> 00:47:52,229
so let them show you where to take them

994
00:47:54,054 --> 00:47:56,155
Don't over simulate, it's a really common thing.

995
00:47:57,035 --> 00:47:58,175
Sometimes you think that's the easiest thing

996
00:47:58,195 --> 00:47:59,675
because you already have some other simulation.

997
00:48:00,556 --> 00:48:04,457
But large scale core simulation driving localized state

998
00:48:04,537 --> 00:48:07,357
and then that localized state driving local simulation

999
00:48:07,397 --> 00:48:08,798
is a very, very effective tool.

1000
00:48:09,898 --> 00:48:11,698
Give the player a little bit of choice

1001
00:48:11,998 --> 00:48:14,159
in their success criteria, or a lot if you can.

1002
00:48:14,759 --> 00:48:16,219
Because even a little bit of player agency

1003
00:48:16,359 --> 00:48:17,820
in those success criteria can allow them

1004
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:20,420
to tell their own story while allowing you,

1005
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:22,341
the developer, to maintain control

1006
00:48:22,381 --> 00:48:23,301
over the overall progression.

1007
00:48:24,541 --> 00:48:25,882
And don't be afraid to move the goalposts.

1008
00:48:26,162 --> 00:48:27,423
I mean, don't be a jerk.

1009
00:48:27,703 --> 00:48:29,924
But if you're not frustrating them,

1010
00:48:30,284 --> 00:48:33,686
this can be an awesome way to create beats in a story

1011
00:48:34,166 --> 00:48:35,947
that otherwise would have stagnated.

1012
00:48:38,769 --> 00:48:39,329
Thank you very much.

1013
00:48:48,374 --> 00:48:50,034
So I talk a lot, but I think I have a few minutes

1014
00:48:50,054 --> 00:48:50,435
for questions.

1015
00:48:55,165 --> 00:49:02,109
Yes, so I have two questions about the starry tree system that you just described.

1016
00:49:02,209 --> 00:49:09,013
First thing is, would you say that adding contents into The Sims is essentially adding

1017
00:49:09,413 --> 00:49:14,076
new possible trees into the game?

1018
00:49:14,356 --> 00:49:14,876
Would you say that?

1019
00:49:15,813 --> 00:49:18,013
uh... any new context of the fact that

1020
00:49:18,193 --> 00:49:20,334
and new content in all yes yes

1021
00:49:21,614 --> 00:49:24,074
you see what we did is we did them in conjunction is basically we would be

1022
00:49:24,114 --> 00:49:27,395
adding content you know we have in expansion or you know d l c

1023
00:49:28,015 --> 00:49:31,916
uh... and all of that content then we could add new trees or inserted into

1024
00:49:31,976 --> 00:49:32,636
existing news

1025
00:49:33,076 --> 00:49:34,316
yes it made it very very easy

1026
00:49:34,676 --> 00:49:36,537
uh... because i said we were adding a content anyway

1027
00:49:36,897 --> 00:49:38,317
for players to expect you play with

1028
00:49:39,297 --> 00:49:41,958
and being able to weave it into all new stories made it even more

1029
00:49:42,318 --> 00:49:42,758
more viable

1030
00:49:43,019 --> 00:49:43,500
All right, thanks.

1031
00:49:43,701 --> 00:49:44,763
And the second question is.

1032
00:49:46,919 --> 00:49:50,320
It's possible for players to, when they get more experience,

1033
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:53,641
they sort of discover these trees, they exist.

1034
00:49:54,101 --> 00:49:57,862
And some of them will try to find out an optimal way

1035
00:49:58,462 --> 00:50:01,342
to play, like they probably find the easiest job

1036
00:50:01,382 --> 00:50:03,163
to make money and be financially free,

1037
00:50:03,203 --> 00:50:04,783
then go on to do whatever they want.

1038
00:50:05,163 --> 00:50:09,884
That, I think, is somehow hurting the possibilities

1039
00:50:09,924 --> 00:50:10,724
to create new stories.

1040
00:50:10,745 --> 00:50:12,605
Do you somehow, do you do anything

1041
00:50:12,645 --> 00:50:14,045
to prevent that from happening?

1042
00:50:14,777 --> 00:50:16,379
I guess there's two things hiding in there. One, no.

1043
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:20,541
Sims is not inherently a challenge-based game,

1044
00:50:20,762 --> 00:50:23,423
or, you know, because it's not an MMO or something

1045
00:50:23,463 --> 00:50:26,125
where you have, you know, accumulated value that matters.

1046
00:50:26,145 --> 00:50:26,546
Right.

1047
00:50:26,566 --> 00:50:28,947
There's very little E-peen going on in The Sims

1048
00:50:30,208 --> 00:50:31,129
that we don't worry too much.

1049
00:50:31,729 --> 00:50:32,730
The other thing is, for the most part,

1050
00:50:32,850 --> 00:50:35,212
these stories are really just suggesting things

1051
00:50:35,252 --> 00:50:35,992
that you could already do.

1052
00:50:36,613 --> 00:50:39,475
So, even if you found a way to sort of find your way

1053
00:50:39,495 --> 00:50:41,456
through the trees, if you even could recognize

1054
00:50:41,476 --> 00:50:41,936
that they were there.

1055
00:50:43,603 --> 00:50:44,744
it probably still wouldn't matter,

1056
00:50:44,884 --> 00:50:46,626
because it's not really giving you an advantage.

1057
00:50:46,786 --> 00:50:47,887
It's just telling you a story.

1058
00:50:48,847 --> 00:50:49,268
Thanks a lot.

1059
00:50:49,728 --> 00:50:51,670
Sure.

1060
00:50:51,830 --> 00:50:52,550
Hi.

1061
00:50:53,171 --> 00:50:54,132
Thanks for a great talk.

1062
00:50:54,572 --> 00:50:56,654
I might have a silly question, but I got to ask.

1063
00:50:57,414 --> 00:51:01,097
Well, I spend hours and hours playing first versions of Sims,

1064
00:51:01,798 --> 00:51:05,901
and I was really honest, and I tried to make a lot of money,

1065
00:51:06,041 --> 00:51:08,523
and I tried to, you know, purchase a better bed,

1066
00:51:08,623 --> 00:51:11,165
because my Sim was always tired, and blah, blah, blah.

1067
00:51:12,006 --> 00:51:16,547
But then my friend told me that there are these cheats, you know, that you can make more money.

1068
00:51:16,827 --> 00:51:17,028
Right.

1069
00:51:17,488 --> 00:51:21,489
So there was just a word and a couple of exclamation marks.

1070
00:51:21,649 --> 00:51:22,529
Roadblood and Motherlode, yeah.

1071
00:51:22,849 --> 00:51:23,069
Yeah.

1072
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:31,272
So I was just wondering, was this also part of the design and storytelling to give player choice to make more money?

1073
00:51:31,972 --> 00:51:33,253
Like, just with one cheat?

1074
00:51:34,467 --> 00:51:38,250
It wasn't part of the story telling per se, but it is catering to people who tell different

1075
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:38,551
stories.

1076
00:51:38,711 --> 00:51:40,632
Some people use The Sims more like action figures.

1077
00:51:41,273 --> 00:51:42,414
It's less about The Sims.

1078
00:51:42,534 --> 00:51:45,296
It's less about emergent stories and it's more about what we call doll housing.

1079
00:51:46,217 --> 00:51:47,618
So we wanted to make sure that you could.

1080
00:51:48,179 --> 00:51:51,341
The reason it's a cheat and not just in the UI is because we didn't want that to be the

1081
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:51,802
normal.

1082
00:51:51,902 --> 00:51:56,005
We didn't want you to accidentally play that way because you felt you should.

1083
00:51:56,486 --> 00:51:59,428
We just wanted you to be able to play that way if you really wanted to.

1084
00:52:04,542 --> 00:52:05,283
Over there.

1085
00:52:05,463 --> 00:52:05,723
OK.

1086
00:52:06,824 --> 00:52:09,966
Hello, thank you for the great speech and the question

1087
00:52:10,006 --> 00:52:11,527
from a die-hard fan of Sims.

1088
00:52:13,228 --> 00:52:17,711
Everybody knows Sims love to die by any stupid means.

1089
00:52:18,632 --> 00:52:21,414
And you usually add extra type of death

1090
00:52:21,774 --> 00:52:24,356
with every game operation event, every add-on.

1091
00:52:25,244 --> 00:52:32,630
Could you please explain how do you come up with new death and what is the design flow for new death for the sims?

1092
00:52:33,351 --> 00:52:38,856
Thank you. That's a good question. We considered it a pack that I don't think we're gonna do

1093
00:52:38,876 --> 00:52:41,898
Because it was a little too narrow. We considered a pack

1094
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:44,901
It was called dangerous things and it was just gonna be ways to die

1095
00:52:45,701 --> 00:52:47,462
It was fun to talk through.

1096
00:52:49,163 --> 00:52:50,724
There isn't really anything too structured about it.

1097
00:52:50,744 --> 00:52:54,806
I think the biggest thing is, and I think the thing that some designers have trouble with,

1098
00:52:54,926 --> 00:52:57,307
is they want to, some designers will say they want to make you cry,

1099
00:52:57,847 --> 00:53:00,368
like in Cats and Dogs, the pack that we shipped recently.

1100
00:53:01,589 --> 00:53:04,450
Some of the designers wanted the dog dying to be this really sad thing,

1101
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:08,571
like where the dog literally goes around to all of the people in the family and says goodbye.

1102
00:53:08,591 --> 00:53:12,053
And then, you know, it dies, it just curls up and dies.

1103
00:53:12,133 --> 00:53:15,714
And we're right, life is already pretty sad.

1104
00:53:16,114 --> 00:53:18,795
So, we don't need to make you sadder.

1105
00:53:19,395 --> 00:53:23,957
So, the biggest thing is, is it a death that we can make charming?

1106
00:53:24,737 --> 00:53:28,919
If it's not a death we can make charming in some way, charming or warm or heartfelt,

1107
00:53:29,079 --> 00:53:29,719
then we don't do it.

1108
00:53:30,735 --> 00:53:31,175
Thank you.

1109
00:53:34,256 --> 00:53:34,496
Hi.

1110
00:53:36,156 --> 00:53:38,857
So, I've played all of the Sims

1111
00:53:38,937 --> 00:53:43,718
and they all change a lot between each of the iterations

1112
00:53:43,758 --> 00:53:48,178
and I'm curious what the process is

1113
00:53:48,819 --> 00:53:53,059
from going, you know, like the first Sim

1114
00:53:53,439 --> 00:53:54,780
all the way to the newest Sim

1115
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:58,100
because there's a lot of changes between all of those.

1116
00:53:59,052 --> 00:53:59,552
uh... well

1117
00:54:00,213 --> 00:54:04,075
the person was that will write makes their may i'd but he still does but he

1118
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:07,138
the way he did make it was he made games that were fundamentally fascinating to

1119
00:54:07,178 --> 00:54:07,338
him

1120
00:54:07,798 --> 00:54:10,620
i'm so actually tended to be pretty geeky is he's pretty deep down

1121
00:54:11,301 --> 00:54:14,343
uh... so the first and was really a more of a psychological

1122
00:54:14,723 --> 00:54:17,345
originally it turned out to be way more fun than that and way more well

1123
00:54:17,785 --> 00:54:18,546
that's fun for some people

1124
00:54:18,826 --> 00:54:21,028
but it's way more fun way way bigger than that

1125
00:54:21,988 --> 00:54:25,251
i used to joke that with seems to like our goal was uh... don't screw it up

1126
00:54:26,612 --> 00:54:28,733
It's a little more colorful than that, but don't screw it up.

1127
00:54:29,313 --> 00:54:31,774
Because we didn't know exactly why Sims 1 was successful.

1128
00:54:31,994 --> 00:54:34,455
We just knew that it was crazy successful, so just don't mess it up.

1129
00:54:34,835 --> 00:54:36,876
And then, so with 2, we didn't make that many changes.

1130
00:54:36,896 --> 00:54:39,698
We mostly, it was what I call a more, more, more design, or 3M design.

1131
00:54:40,458 --> 00:54:43,579
We mostly just took everything in Sims 1 and we added more to it.

1132
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:46,221
The wants and fears that I mentioned was the one big thing that we introduced there.

1133
00:54:47,441 --> 00:54:51,264
And then in Sims 3 it was slightly different because we hadn't screwed it up.

1134
00:54:51,985 --> 00:54:53,626
So we had a chance to screw it up.

1135
00:54:54,187 --> 00:54:57,449
So we basically went all the way back down to sort of the core motivations of players

1136
00:54:57,990 --> 00:55:02,053
and the core systems and said what systems, what were they trying to achieve and could we achieve more?

1137
00:55:03,154 --> 00:55:07,477
And or if the system wasn't really, didn't have any purpose in the end, we got rid of it.

1138
00:55:08,278 --> 00:55:09,579
Sims 4 was a little more complicated.

1139
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:12,841
Its development was pretty storied. It went through several different stages, but...

1140
00:55:12,861 --> 00:55:14,523
Cool. Thank you.

1141
00:55:16,819 --> 00:55:22,901
Hi, you talked a lot about progression on the trees by successfully completing your wants.

1142
00:55:23,541 --> 00:55:27,862
Are there any trees that are based off of successfully completing your fears?

1143
00:55:28,722 --> 00:55:29,563
Yes, absolutely.

1144
00:55:30,723 --> 00:55:36,024
So, I didn't show any of those, but there are things where basically your sim will have either regret,

1145
00:55:36,225 --> 00:55:41,166
or they'll have more crippling fears, like if something happens that they were afraid of.

1146
00:55:42,503 --> 00:55:44,624
There's things where they react to fears.

1147
00:55:45,164 --> 00:55:46,945
The dumbest one is a little tree that if there's a,

1148
00:55:47,645 --> 00:55:49,626
so not deep, but it works within the same system,

1149
00:55:49,666 --> 00:55:50,687
is if they have a house fire,

1150
00:55:50,767 --> 00:55:52,107
they'll want to buy a fire alarm,

1151
00:55:53,028 --> 00:55:54,848
like we all do after the thing happens.

1152
00:55:56,449 --> 00:55:57,390
So there are little things like that,

1153
00:55:57,430 --> 00:55:58,550
but yeah, we definitely did that a lot.

1154
00:55:58,950 --> 00:55:59,831
One thing that that reminded me

1155
00:55:59,851 --> 00:56:01,051
that I maybe didn't make clear,

1156
00:56:01,171 --> 00:56:03,912
that again, these nodes can be satisfied

1157
00:56:04,113 --> 00:56:05,693
even if they're not wants.

1158
00:56:05,933 --> 00:56:07,614
So even if the player, the sim doesn't want them,

1159
00:56:07,734 --> 00:56:08,675
they're still satisfied.

1160
00:56:08,735 --> 00:56:10,355
So anything that happens can trigger these things.

1161
00:56:11,056 --> 00:56:11,736
Cool, thank you.

1162
00:56:13,918 --> 00:56:19,882
Have there been any studies on the way that players play The Sims that you know of?

1163
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:25,365
So like, what would you say is the percentage of people who will do like,

1164
00:56:25,525 --> 00:56:30,488
this is me and my friends and my family simulation and then there's the people zoos.

1165
00:56:32,784 --> 00:56:34,365
We're just now getting into more,

1166
00:56:35,306 --> 00:56:36,446
and we're starting to look at ways, honestly,

1167
00:56:36,466 --> 00:56:38,928
to use machine learning to try to identify play styles

1168
00:56:38,968 --> 00:56:40,509
that are maybe more subtle,

1169
00:56:41,069 --> 00:56:43,070
because those are really hard to detect in raw data.

1170
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:46,492
So, the Sims, before Sims 4,

1171
00:56:46,532 --> 00:56:47,713
we didn't have a whole lot of telemetry.

1172
00:56:47,733 --> 00:56:48,313
In Sims 4, we have...

1173
00:56:49,934 --> 00:56:53,456
every interaction that every sim in every game has ever performed ever.

1174
00:56:54,217 --> 00:56:55,177
And we still have them.

1175
00:56:56,218 --> 00:56:59,740
We have this crazy reef of data that we can mine to do things like that.

1176
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:01,942
We haven't yet figured out the more subtle play styles,

1177
00:57:01,982 --> 00:57:05,824
like are you torturing your sims or are you playing your family or celebrities or things like that.

1178
00:57:07,225 --> 00:57:12,148
We definitely do studies to try to identify the core clusters for how players play.

1179
00:57:12,168 --> 00:57:13,689
We used to think of them really simplistically,

1180
00:57:14,289 --> 00:57:17,251
as like builders, casters, people who just make characters,

1181
00:57:17,972 --> 00:57:18,052
or...

1182
00:57:19,753 --> 00:57:22,834
gamers who are actually trying to play like a game and progress or progressors

1183
00:57:23,595 --> 00:57:26,316
and doll housers people who are just telling stories and they weren't

1184
00:57:26,376 --> 00:57:29,698
actually playing the simulation. Over time it's gotten a little more subtle

1185
00:57:29,718 --> 00:57:33,881
than that so the way they are clusters but we're just getting into what you're

1186
00:57:33,901 --> 00:57:36,462
describing I'm really excited about it. We're actually we're actually doing a

1187
00:57:36,482 --> 00:57:40,845
study right now that is focused around how people handle romance.

1188
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:46,449
So like, are they romancing a bunch of Sims, are they all playing, you know, nuclear families,

1189
00:57:46,529 --> 00:57:50,172
like that kind of a thing, so that we can decide where to make the relationship system richer.

1190
00:57:50,947 --> 00:57:54,610
It seems like a really good psychological tool.

1191
00:57:54,810 --> 00:57:56,812
The other one I want to do is trying

1192
00:57:56,832 --> 00:57:59,614
to see if people play to the characters that they create.

1193
00:57:59,674 --> 00:58:02,457
So if you make a sim that's mean, do you play them mean?

1194
00:58:02,797 --> 00:58:04,999
If you make a sim that's flirty, do you play them flirty?

1195
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:06,941
Because on the behavioral side, we

1196
00:58:06,981 --> 00:58:08,062
make them try to act flirty.

1197
00:58:08,462 --> 00:58:10,424
But I'm really curious to see if players

1198
00:58:10,464 --> 00:58:12,326
lean into whatever the sim was that they made,

1199
00:58:12,806 --> 00:58:14,087
or if they try to play against the grain,

1200
00:58:14,267 --> 00:58:15,028
because that's also fun.

1201
00:58:16,029 --> 00:58:16,209
Thanks.

1202
00:58:17,517 --> 00:58:20,137
Hi, the Sims 1 and 2 consumed my childhood, so thank you.

1203
00:58:20,897 --> 00:58:22,438
And also I'm curious, are there any...

1204
00:58:22,518 --> 00:58:23,438
Don't introduce me to your parents.

1205
00:58:24,718 --> 00:58:26,538
Are there any game mechanics introduced

1206
00:58:26,558 --> 00:58:28,199
that did not have the outcome you expected?

1207
00:58:29,219 --> 00:58:32,219
Hmm, that's a really good question.

1208
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:34,200
Oh, I'm trying to think.

1209
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:37,820
I'm absolutely certain there are.

1210
00:58:40,261 --> 00:58:41,961
But I honestly don't know any right off the top of my head.

1211
00:58:43,822 --> 00:58:46,442
Part of that is that a lot of the mechanics that we introduce...

1212
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:50,261
Now I really can't think of anything off the top of my head.

1213
00:58:52,142 --> 00:58:52,702
No, sorry.

1214
00:58:52,722 --> 00:58:55,664
I was going to say, a lot of the mechanics that we introduce,

1215
00:58:57,365 --> 00:59:00,566
in and of themselves, this is going to sound maybe pretentious,

1216
00:59:01,067 --> 00:59:02,487
or dodgy, but in and of themselves,

1217
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:05,029
we don't necessarily expect a specific outcome from one system.

1218
00:59:05,349 --> 00:59:07,890
A lot of the times when we're designing systems,

1219
00:59:07,930 --> 00:59:10,031
we design them to be interesting, to bounce off of each other.

1220
00:59:10,051 --> 00:59:12,613
We just try to make sure that there's enough touch points between them,

1221
00:59:13,153 --> 00:59:14,414
that interesting stuff can happen.

1222
00:59:15,534 --> 00:59:18,817
Oh, I do have one and it was a subtle thing. Sorry. It was back in this Once in Fears.

1223
00:59:18,997 --> 00:59:20,278
Maybe it's just a little cautionary tale.

1224
00:59:21,178 --> 00:59:25,641
These Once in Fears in the original version, they're very thoughtfully presented.

1225
00:59:25,781 --> 00:59:28,323
Like if you, if your Sims, if you do it right, your Sims will,

1226
00:59:29,004 --> 00:59:30,405
they will sound like they're just paying attention.

1227
00:59:30,445 --> 00:59:33,106
Oh my God, like they get something. They're deep. There's a lot going on in there.

1228
00:59:34,187 --> 00:59:35,427
and somewhere along the line,

1229
00:59:35,968 --> 00:59:37,548
what we did is every morning when the sim wakes up,

1230
00:59:37,848 --> 00:59:40,109
they roll new wants and fears, they reevaluate.

1231
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:43,791
And somewhere in there, we decided that the way

1232
00:59:43,811 --> 00:59:45,231
we should do that so you didn't miss it

1233
00:59:45,391 --> 00:59:47,572
was we should make them spin like slot machine wheels,

1234
00:59:48,852 --> 00:59:51,233
which honestly made me really angry.

1235
00:59:51,652 --> 01:00:12,009
But in the end, but angry, but was because what the effect it had was that players then saw them and because they look like slot machines, a lot of players assume they were random, which given that we put all this effort into the system that made them extra not random and very intentional was a little disappointing that some players thought that they were random just because of the way we ended up treating them in the UI.

1236
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:12,950
Thanks.

1237
01:00:15,396 --> 01:00:18,417
I was curious with the wants and fears graphs,

1238
01:00:19,378 --> 01:00:23,099
if you ever considered having that drive autonomous behavior,

1239
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:28,622
benefits and hindrances to that, and also just how many of these

1240
01:00:29,863 --> 01:00:31,303
in general are there in the game?

1241
01:00:32,424 --> 01:00:34,485
Well, there are hundreds of them in the game.

1242
01:00:34,825 --> 01:00:37,746
And they, like I said, probably...

1243
01:00:38,414 --> 01:00:43,617
easily thousands of nodes. The tool is built to be able to manage lots of data and to tune lots of data really quickly,

1244
01:00:43,857 --> 01:00:47,339
like to tune things across hundreds of trees at the same time, if you need to.

1245
01:00:48,299 --> 01:00:53,081
It's pretty manageable because each tree is made in isolation and you really don't have to think about the other trees when you make it.

1246
01:00:53,121 --> 01:00:55,583
So you can be like, ooh, I had a good idea for a story and you can just go,

1247
01:00:55,663 --> 01:00:59,745
and you don't have to worry about what it's going to do. You have to keep the scoring a little consistent, otherwise

1248
01:01:00,245 --> 01:01:02,206
certain threads can overtake other threads, but

1249
01:01:02,926 --> 01:01:04,487
it's pretty loose and it still works.

1250
01:01:04,507 --> 01:01:06,968
Sorry, what was your other question?

1251
01:01:07,376 --> 01:01:11,177
Another question was, did you consider using not just for once in a few years?

1252
01:01:11,437 --> 01:01:12,558
You can come work for us if you want.

1253
01:01:13,598 --> 01:01:17,939
No, that is something that I would like to do in the future.

1254
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:20,800
So, absolutely considering it.

1255
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:26,602
It doesn't do that obviously, or not obviously, but I didn't mention it because it doesn't do that in previous examples.

1256
01:01:27,142 --> 01:01:30,803
But it absolutely is something that I think would carry this to the next level and it's very natural and very easy.

1257
01:01:31,644 --> 01:01:33,205
If the sim is saying he wants this thing,

1258
01:01:33,225 --> 01:01:34,426
we can do it both ways.

1259
01:01:34,466 --> 01:01:36,428
The things that they're actively surfacing

1260
01:01:36,728 --> 01:01:37,989
could easily modulate behavior.

1261
01:01:38,009 --> 01:01:40,091
Just throw that into the big A small i.

1262
01:01:40,131 --> 01:01:41,732
Now he's just trying to do those things on his own.

1263
01:01:42,393 --> 01:01:44,675
And I can see that being cool if it was a gradient.

1264
01:01:44,935 --> 01:01:46,156
Like some things he cares about a little,

1265
01:01:46,216 --> 01:01:47,337
some things he's obsessed with.

1266
01:01:47,737 --> 01:01:50,119
And you know it because you have to keep canceling it.

1267
01:01:50,379 --> 01:01:51,460
Stop using the telescope!

1268
01:01:52,701 --> 01:01:53,201
That kind of thing.

1269
01:01:53,622 --> 01:01:54,802
But we could also do it with hidden stuff,

1270
01:01:55,183 --> 01:01:56,563
just to make it seem more subtle,

1271
01:01:56,823 --> 01:01:58,885
and would make the Sims feel a little more intentional.

1272
01:01:59,005 --> 01:02:01,046
And maybe when you saw him, you know,

1273
01:02:01,346 --> 01:02:02,527
trying to call this girl,

1274
01:02:03,207 --> 01:02:04,268
even if he wasn't asking for it,

1275
01:02:04,288 --> 01:02:05,308
and you saw him calling, and be like,

1276
01:02:05,428 --> 01:02:07,210
oh, that's right, he met her at the restaurant.

1277
01:02:08,010 --> 01:02:08,750
That makes total sense.

1278
01:02:08,971 --> 01:02:09,971
So yeah, no, I think that's a great idea.

1279
01:02:10,832 --> 01:02:11,052
Thanks.

1280
01:02:12,733 --> 01:02:12,933
Cool.

1281
01:02:13,573 --> 01:02:13,973
Thanks, everybody.
