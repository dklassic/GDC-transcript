1
00:00:00,333 --> 00:00:06,710
Okay, all right, we'll kick it off. So this is about an hour. We might have some time for some Q&A.

2
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:09,036
We'll go through at a high level.

3
00:00:10,129 --> 00:00:14,792
how we took Tomb Raider, started it, looked at reinventing it and all the way through

4
00:00:14,792 --> 00:00:18,795
the last four years to what we have released March the 5th just recently.

5
00:00:18,795 --> 00:00:23,858
My name is Darryl Gallagher, I'm the studio head for Crystal Dynamics and to my right

6
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:29,542
here is Noah Hughes, creative director at Crystal Dynamics and on Tomb Raider.

7
00:00:29,542 --> 00:00:34,125
So we're just off the back of a very successful launch of Tomb Raider.

8
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:37,007
How many here have actually played it or seen it?

9
00:00:37,327 --> 00:00:41,129
Some hands? Good. Awesome. Nice. That's a good start.

10
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:41,609
Thank you.

11
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:44,071
How many here have got a hangover from last night?

12
00:00:44,071 --> 00:00:44,791
That's why I'm here.

13
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:46,112
So excuse any stumbles.

14
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:54,135
Okay, so thankfully we had a great launch in March for this game

15
00:00:54,135 --> 00:01:02,940
and we had this talk prepped prior to launching the game on the reinvention and reboot of Tomb Raider.

16
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,082
And it was successful, so we didn't have to rewrite the talk, which we're very happy about.

17
00:01:07,082 --> 00:01:10,104
It could have been a what went wrong. Thankfully, it's not that.

18
00:01:10,104 --> 00:01:16,488
So it really is a broad case of here are some things that we thought went well,

19
00:01:16,488 --> 00:01:18,409
some pro tips around the project,

20
00:01:18,409 --> 00:01:23,773
and some experiences we had from start to finish that we hope that we can share with you today.

21
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:31,431
So we're going to go through a quick outline here from a franchise perspective, how we

22
00:01:31,431 --> 00:01:34,751
went about reinventing an icon such as Lara Croft and Tomb Raider.

23
00:01:34,751 --> 00:01:41,413
Goals and methodology, in terms of our high level goals at the beginning of the project,

24
00:01:41,413 --> 00:01:44,693
some of the things we look to want to achieve.

25
00:01:44,693 --> 00:01:48,614
Some production techniques in terms of how we made the project and how we went through

26
00:01:48,614 --> 00:01:50,535
each phase of the project at a high level.

27
00:01:51,807 --> 00:01:57,589
creative techniques with Noah in terms of how we went about making a very narrative driven production

28
00:01:57,589 --> 00:02:04,031
and it involved changing major parts of how we did things at Crystal and last but not least

29
00:02:04,031 --> 00:02:09,232
some pro tips that we hope we can leave you with today and maybe take back to your studios and learn from.

30
00:02:10,312 --> 00:02:16,175
So at a high level it was roughly a four year period from start to finish on this project

31
00:02:16,175 --> 00:02:22,498
and it wasn't always perfect. So while this PowerPoint is nice and slick and we've rehearsed

32
00:02:22,498 --> 00:02:26,320
and we'll go through it in an hour, the actual production of four years you're going to have

33
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:31,783
bumps along the way. So I just wanted to say that these are some of the good things we've learned

34
00:02:31,783 --> 00:02:37,125
but any project you do that is special and we wanted this to be special is going to be tough.

35
00:02:37,385 --> 00:02:45,872
and it had bumps along the way so this is a consolidated version of that.

36
00:02:45,872 --> 00:02:50,636
Digging into the project, it's the biggest game we've ever done at Crystal.

37
00:02:50,636 --> 00:02:52,978
It's two teams that have worked on this.

38
00:02:52,978 --> 00:02:57,481
We did the single player here, close to here, 25 miles away in Redwood City.

39
00:02:57,481 --> 00:03:01,844
And the multiplayer was done with our sister studio, Eidos Montreal, in Canada.

40
00:03:02,485 --> 00:03:10,288
We were lucky enough to get a huge amount of recognition along the way as we were making this game.

41
00:03:10,288 --> 00:03:15,830
We had over 50 magazine covers and two E3 stage demos and over 150 awards and nominations along the way,

42
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:24,594
which on a long development of three or four years is very encouraging and definitely put some fuel in the fire that we were doing something right.

43
00:03:24,994 --> 00:03:29,157
It's been the biggest week one sales in franchise history.

44
00:03:29,157 --> 00:03:35,342
We're only a few weeks into that launch right now and it's been the biggest opening so far of 2013.

45
00:03:35,342 --> 00:03:37,623
So we're happy with the outcome.

46
00:03:37,623 --> 00:03:41,646
We're certainly in a place where we feel like we're on our road to achieving everything we wanted to.

47
00:03:41,646 --> 00:03:47,190
I'm going to play a quick video right now which is just a short 60 second recap of where we landed.

48
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:01,282
Every survivor has a story.

49
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:06,185
You've got great instincts, girl.

50
00:04:06,185 --> 00:04:07,625
You just have to trust them.

51
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:11,327
Every mystery has its truth.

52
00:04:11,327 --> 00:04:15,410
What the hell is happening on this island?

53
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,431
Every saga has its beginning.

54
00:04:40,422 --> 00:04:41,402
Alright, there it is.

55
00:04:41,402 --> 00:04:48,745
So we're going to talk about how we got there from beginning, middle to end.

56
00:04:48,745 --> 00:04:50,986
It was an epic adventure, much like one of Lara's.

57
00:04:50,986 --> 00:04:55,248
And we're going to walk you through that at a very high level.

58
00:04:55,248 --> 00:05:00,770
Some of our challenges, you know, it's great to be working on a franchise like Tomb Raider

59
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:05,271
with the recognition and the popularity it has, but it came with challenges.

60
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:07,232
And with 17 years of history since 1996...

61
00:05:07,772 --> 00:05:12,453
It left us in a position as we finished up three games at Crystal feeling like we had to make some changes.

62
00:05:12,453 --> 00:05:19,374
And that's natural when you're dealing with a long-running franchise, but we were really encountering this for the first time.

63
00:05:19,374 --> 00:05:27,556
As a result of the ups and downs of that long history, you have sort of mixed feelings and loyalty around sort of a fan base.

64
00:05:27,556 --> 00:05:32,977
We had new contenders at that time in 2008, 2009 when we were starting this in the likes of...

65
00:05:33,437 --> 00:05:37,579
Assassin's Creed or Uncharted or God of War 3, there was a new generation of hardware

66
00:05:37,579 --> 00:05:42,922
and there were new contenders to the Action-Adventure crown that were bringing their new angles

67
00:05:42,922 --> 00:05:46,304
and really doing some great stuff around Action-Adventure too.

68
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:53,044
Also we had a generational change, not only in hardware, but it was also in terms of our

69
00:05:53,044 --> 00:05:55,045
fan base and our audience as well.

70
00:05:55,045 --> 00:05:59,368
Obviously, 17 years later, the people that may have started playing Tomb Raider in 96

71
00:05:59,368 --> 00:06:01,610
may be different people today.

72
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,131
They may have never played it before.

73
00:06:03,131 --> 00:06:05,092
Some people would have and some people won't.

74
00:06:05,092 --> 00:06:09,595
So we also had to think about how we spanned from one generation to another, and that was

75
00:06:09,595 --> 00:06:12,397
some of the challenges we were dealing with going into this project.

76
00:06:12,797 --> 00:06:18,760
So, these were some of the things we did coming off the back of a trilogy we created in Legend,

77
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,061
Anniversary and Underworld.

78
00:06:20,061 --> 00:06:24,664
And as we finished that up, that was very much based on a formula very much from Core

79
00:06:24,664 --> 00:06:27,305
Design and we were successful with that formula.

80
00:06:27,305 --> 00:06:33,209
But going into this new phase of Tomb Raider, these were some of the challenges we felt

81
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:34,669
like we had to deal with.

82
00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:35,890
From a goals perspective...

83
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:41,332
Ultimately, we wanted people to fall in love with Tomb Raider once again, with this next game.

84
00:06:41,332 --> 00:06:43,952
And this is what we started with way back when.

85
00:06:43,952 --> 00:06:48,874
We had a real goal to make Lara somebody you could get to know again, to humanise her,

86
00:06:48,874 --> 00:06:53,975
for her to be less of this superhero that you knew because you played N number of games and seen the movies,

87
00:06:53,975 --> 00:07:00,057
but somebody that we actually got to know once again and fall in love with over again, like it happened in 1996.

88
00:07:01,183 --> 00:07:04,806
So therefore we had to challenge the expectations around Lara and the brand.

89
00:07:04,806 --> 00:07:09,931
We had to make sure that we were embracing this new audience that maybe hadn't played Tomb Raider before,

90
00:07:09,931 --> 00:07:14,116
or maybe they were old fans that were revisiting that we had lost along the way.

91
00:07:14,116 --> 00:07:17,038
And to do that we really felt like we had to make some big changes.

92
00:07:17,676 --> 00:07:24,162
Quality and innovation was synonymous with Tomb Raider in 1996 and along the way it was

93
00:07:24,162 --> 00:07:27,124
one of the pioneers in action adventure.

94
00:07:27,124 --> 00:07:31,728
So we wanted to put that stamp back into this game, we wanted to be right up there as the

95
00:07:31,728 --> 00:07:32,889
best of the best.

96
00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:36,873
So these were high goals that we had at the beginning of this project.

97
00:07:37,093 --> 00:07:42,497
And ultimately we still had to thread the needle because it's a tightrope to walk between old and new.

98
00:07:42,497 --> 00:07:48,601
That we had this franchise with this fanbase and all this rich history, but we wanted to take it to a new place.

99
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:54,325
And that tightrope is a very, very narrow one to walk because too much old and it feels like it's...

100
00:07:54,565 --> 00:07:59,646
the old game, and it may as well be a sequel, too much new, and maybe it wouldn't be Tomb Raider anymore.

101
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:08,529
And whilst we sort of approached this with a blank canvas, the actual reality was it was a very, very narrow razor that we had to walk.

102
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:10,690
So it's tough doing these types of games as reboots.

103
00:08:12,231 --> 00:08:16,733
Originally, it actually didn't start as a reboot, it was almost a pseudo-sequel.

104
00:08:16,733 --> 00:08:23,015
And as ideas were being kicked around in the early stages of development in concept and in pre-production,

105
00:08:23,015 --> 00:08:27,196
it became clear that to achieve the goals we just set out in slides before,

106
00:08:27,196 --> 00:08:30,437
that we ultimately had to wipe the slate clean.

107
00:08:30,437 --> 00:08:36,480
And we needed to make a fresh start with this character, and a fresh start with no preconceptions built in for the audience.

108
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:41,981
So ultimately it became an origin story and we were buoyed and encouraged by other franchises

109
00:08:41,981 --> 00:08:47,642
around us outside video games where we looked and we felt that they had actually taken a

110
00:08:47,642 --> 00:08:48,462
similar approach.

111
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:54,164
So here we have Bond and Batman that are two amazing examples outside games where Bond

112
00:08:54,164 --> 00:08:59,425
has been around 50 years this year and has just done a billion dollars at the box office.

113
00:08:59,425 --> 00:09:05,827
So it's as fresh as it was 50 years ago today and Batman is in a similar place as well.

114
00:09:06,267 --> 00:09:12,210
And I think the key thing about this and why we looked here is because in games having 17 years of history,

115
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:16,333
ultimately we were one of the first to have to go through this.

116
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:21,856
You know, it's a shorter time scale in games in terms of people having franchises

117
00:09:21,856 --> 00:09:26,719
because game space is much narrower and obviously younger than things like movies.

118
00:09:27,119 --> 00:09:32,983
So we looked outside and what we felt was these franchises have done such a great job

119
00:09:32,983 --> 00:09:38,346
in retaining the DNA of their characters and their franchises but bringing it to new generations

120
00:09:38,346 --> 00:09:40,948
and really making it feel fresh.

121
00:09:40,948 --> 00:09:45,891
And they've managed to span generation to generation but retain their franchise integrity.

122
00:09:46,632 --> 00:09:52,660
So we were very much inspired by this and this origin story, but we really had to find our own slant on that.

123
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:58,808
And ultimately, we knew we wanted to make an origin story, we knew that we had these high goals,

124
00:09:58,808 --> 00:10:04,054
but we were looking in early stages around how we could hang our hooks on something that made it feel fresh.

125
00:10:04,475 --> 00:10:06,998
for Tomb Raider and also fresh in the industry.

126
00:10:06,998 --> 00:10:12,964
So many ideas were thrown around and explored in the early stages of development

127
00:10:12,964 --> 00:10:18,169
and ultimately we landed in a spot where we found something we felt that we could hang our hooks on,

128
00:10:18,169 --> 00:10:20,091
which I'll hand over to Noah to discuss.

129
00:10:20,251 --> 00:10:27,795
Yeah, it was important to understand that in humanizing Lara by rolling her back to an origin story,

130
00:10:27,795 --> 00:10:32,637
we were making her closer to you or I and hopefully a more relatable character.

131
00:10:32,637 --> 00:10:36,059
But the most exciting part about it was that we could then take her on that journey,

132
00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:39,821
we could take the players on that journey to becoming the Tomb Raider.

133
00:10:39,821 --> 00:10:40,081
But...

134
00:10:40,862 --> 00:10:44,462
We needed a sense of identity beyond just origin story.

135
00:10:44,462 --> 00:10:47,023
So we looked at a lot of different things,

136
00:10:47,023 --> 00:10:50,264
but ultimately we came upon the idea of survival stories.

137
00:10:50,264 --> 00:10:52,164
And for us, we were really inspired

138
00:10:52,164 --> 00:10:56,625
by the real world tales of survival.

139
00:10:56,625 --> 00:11:00,026
We have Aaron Ralston here, who featured in 127 Hours,

140
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:04,167
ultimately had to cut off his own arm in order to survive.

141
00:11:04,167 --> 00:11:05,907
Or the rugby players in the Andes

142
00:11:05,907 --> 00:11:10,028
who resorted to cannibalism in order to survive.

143
00:11:10,028 --> 00:11:10,388
These are.

144
00:11:11,089 --> 00:11:14,592
at the surface, very dark stories.

145
00:11:14,592 --> 00:11:16,834
But what was interesting to us is

146
00:11:16,834 --> 00:11:21,858
there was a sense of inspiration to these stories,

147
00:11:21,858 --> 00:11:24,220
that there was a memorable journey here

148
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:29,025
that showcased the human capacity to overcome.

149
00:11:29,025 --> 00:11:30,746
And ultimately, through that journey,

150
00:11:30,746 --> 00:11:33,028
these people were changed as well.

151
00:11:33,028 --> 00:11:34,990
So that idea that we could.

152
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:40,918
take Lara's origin story and tell it through the lens of survival was very compelling to

153
00:11:40,918 --> 00:11:44,323
us and we felt would help humanize her as a character.

154
00:11:44,323 --> 00:11:48,329
But we had to zoom in a little bit and understand what that meant.

155
00:11:48,329 --> 00:11:49,731
I think what we found was that

156
00:11:50,552 --> 00:11:53,455
Survival can be many different things to many different people.

157
00:11:53,455 --> 00:11:57,058
So we tried to clarify what it would mean to us in this game.

158
00:11:57,058 --> 00:11:59,040
So first of all, survival action.

159
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,761
And that's to sort of balance out this sense

160
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:04,364
that there's a simulation version of survival as well.

161
00:12:04,364 --> 00:12:07,307
But because pace was incredibly important to our game

162
00:12:07,307 --> 00:12:10,970
experience, we really wanted to capture that survival action.

163
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:13,852
But it would still be brutal, perilous, raw.

164
00:12:13,852 --> 00:12:15,353
This would be the harsh environment

165
00:12:15,353 --> 00:12:17,315
that would forge Lara.

166
00:12:17,315 --> 00:12:18,836
And it would ultimately ask her.

167
00:12:19,377 --> 00:12:22,800
to fight to survive, that we wanted to showcase

168
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,763
her determination as a character, her endurance, her will to live in the face

169
00:12:26,763 --> 00:12:27,664
of death,

170
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:31,847
but also as a character who's sort of an intellectual hero.

171
00:12:31,847 --> 00:12:35,771
We love that aspect of resourcefulness that we saw in these stories. Here's

172
00:12:35,771 --> 00:12:36,591
people who

173
00:12:36,591 --> 00:12:40,054
had nothing and they had to make do with what they had and it was really

174
00:12:40,054 --> 00:12:43,077
that ability to adapt to their situation

175
00:12:43,077 --> 00:12:46,500
that let them survive. So these are all things that very much resonated with

176
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:51,366
the franchise for us. So just to capture some in a sentence, the idea of the

177
00:12:51,366 --> 00:12:55,191
determination to go beyond human endurance, taking the moment of raw

178
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:59,917
instinct and stretching it. It's about overcoming that near-death experiences

179
00:12:59,917 --> 00:13:00,919
time and time again.

180
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,721
So we had now an inspiration in survival.

181
00:13:05,721 --> 00:13:08,302
And at the end of this concept phase,

182
00:13:08,302 --> 00:13:11,403
we sort of summed that up with a survivor is born.

183
00:13:11,403 --> 00:13:14,083
And ultimately, that became our tagline.

184
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:16,344
But internally, it was also a guiding vision.

185
00:13:16,344 --> 00:13:19,985
It captured that idea of Lara's origin story seen

186
00:13:19,985 --> 00:13:21,405
through the lens of survival.

187
00:13:21,405 --> 00:13:24,526
So with that, we felt we had a very clear sense

188
00:13:24,526 --> 00:13:26,367
of a high-level vision for the game.

189
00:13:26,367 --> 00:13:27,987
So I'll turn it over to Daryl to get back

190
00:13:27,987 --> 00:13:28,908
into production a little bit.

191
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:29,408
Thanks, Noah.

192
00:13:33,095 --> 00:13:39,463
So now we had our identity, at least a hook we felt we could work with, and a high level of what we wanted to do with the game.

193
00:13:39,463 --> 00:13:47,532
And ultimately going into the high level in production, I guess I wanted to sort of carve out what we use, which is a rule of thirds.

194
00:13:47,532 --> 00:13:51,076
This at a high level is what we've done on the last couple of projects at Crystal.

195
00:13:51,256 --> 00:13:53,458
including Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light.

196
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,340
And essentially it's just breaking your production from a high level into

197
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:00,123
one third for pre-production and what we call vertical slice,

198
00:14:00,123 --> 00:14:02,125
which is the end of pre-production for us,

199
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:05,127
one third for production, and one third for post-production.

200
00:14:05,809 --> 00:14:11,031
Some commentary around that, I mean typically what we've seen, you know we've all made a lot of games here,

201
00:14:11,031 --> 00:14:17,214
is that that first third and that last third tend to get squished and shortchanged in lots of ways.

202
00:14:17,214 --> 00:14:23,398
And we felt that it was important that we actually maintained sort of an uncompromising view on what we wanted in each third,

203
00:14:23,398 --> 00:14:27,640
and therefore shape the production around this rule of thirds.

204
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:32,002
We wanted to give as much time as we could in post-production to polish and refine.

205
00:14:32,482 --> 00:14:36,824
what we had and we wanted to make sure that every step of the way in pre-production and

206
00:14:36,824 --> 00:14:39,605
vertical slice it was clear what game we were making.

207
00:14:39,605 --> 00:14:44,768
So there's always a lot of pressures in each one of these phases and even though it was

208
00:14:44,768 --> 00:14:49,070
a four year period essentially once we found our hook of survival in early exploration

209
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:54,412
really that pre-production to vertical slice phase was one year, production was one year

210
00:14:54,412 --> 00:14:58,634
and post-production was one year and we're going to walk through each one of those phases

211
00:14:58,634 --> 00:15:01,755
at a high level and show some videos of where we were at each stage.

212
00:15:03,407 --> 00:15:10,731
So some quick stats around it. We made a 12 hour plus experience. 10 to 12 hours is what we were aiming for.

213
00:15:10,731 --> 00:15:16,734
We actually found that once people played the game, we saw them play for 14, 18, 20, 25 and more.

214
00:15:16,734 --> 00:15:20,896
So we've been very pleased with the feedback.

215
00:15:22,634 --> 00:15:28,676
absolutely built a very, very big production in this game because it was a complex, big game to make.

216
00:15:28,676 --> 00:15:31,197
So we had to focus very much on our tools and pipeline.

217
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:34,198
I know Jason has given a talk this week around our tools.

218
00:15:34,198 --> 00:15:40,560
Also there's some other talks around our process today as well from some other folks at Crystal, so please go see those.

219
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,042
But tools and pipeline, because we weren't going to be able to...

220
00:15:44,482 --> 00:15:46,703
an army of hundreds making this game,

221
00:15:46,703 --> 00:15:49,646
we were gonna be under a hundred ultimately

222
00:15:49,646 --> 00:15:52,888
making this game happen on the single player side.

223
00:15:52,888 --> 00:15:54,990
So we wanted tools and pipelines

224
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,891
to really be that driving force

225
00:15:56,891 --> 00:15:58,673
to help us iterate quickly,

226
00:15:58,673 --> 00:16:00,154
to help designers and artists

227
00:16:00,154 --> 00:16:02,055
really have the power in their hands.

228
00:16:02,055 --> 00:16:04,577
So it was a big investment in the tools that we made

229
00:16:04,577 --> 00:16:06,859
to make a level editor that really put the power in

230
00:16:06,859 --> 00:16:09,121
the content creator's hands with live editing,

231
00:16:09,121 --> 00:16:11,182
live updating, and a very flexible,

232
00:16:11,182 --> 00:16:12,944
powerful system to create content.

233
00:16:13,644 --> 00:16:16,908
We totally turned our production methodology on its head.

234
00:16:16,908 --> 00:16:20,332
In many ways in this production, we did things very, very differently.

235
00:16:20,332 --> 00:16:23,755
And because we were building such an important origin story,

236
00:16:23,755 --> 00:16:26,779
we actually made a beat-driven development process.

237
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:29,281
Now we'll actually go into a little bit more detail there.

238
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:34,107
But essentially, in previous games, it was saying we wanted to do 10 or 12 hours.

239
00:16:34,687 --> 00:16:39,328
What's the footprint for that? It's about this big, let's fill it with stuff.

240
00:16:39,328 --> 00:16:47,830
And this one, it was, we still wanted 10 to 12 hours, but we wanted every moment to feel like it fitted into a larger picture.

241
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:54,492
So the scheduling and production was built around beats and moments that we wanted to deliver from an experiential standpoint.

242
00:16:54,492 --> 00:17:01,793
And that's how we costed things, that's how we produced things, and that's how we scheduled out the whole production.

243
00:17:01,793 --> 00:17:04,494
So the actual footprint from the game was built from beats.

244
00:17:04,574 --> 00:17:07,497
which we'll go into again a little later with Noah.

245
00:17:07,497 --> 00:17:10,159
We also had a very modular level design process,

246
00:17:10,159 --> 00:17:11,961
especially on the art side,

247
00:17:11,961 --> 00:17:14,102
that ultimately we had to build big worlds,

248
00:17:14,102 --> 00:17:16,425
biggest worlds we've ever built for Tomb Raider,

249
00:17:16,425 --> 00:17:19,787
and we had to do it in a way where we kept the fidelity,

250
00:17:19,787 --> 00:17:22,049
but we kept flexibility in building them too.

251
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:28,572
So we had a very instance-driven art approach with the art team and the design team where

252
00:17:28,572 --> 00:17:34,094
there was a lot of repetition, a lot of clicking together Lego pieces to really build an organic

253
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:34,734
world.

254
00:17:34,734 --> 00:17:39,776
And that was a complete 180 on how we built things before at Crystal, and still do have

255
00:17:39,776 --> 00:17:41,296
a very crafted look.

256
00:17:41,677 --> 00:17:45,318
But ultimately we wanted that crafted look, but we wanted flexibility with it.

257
00:17:45,318 --> 00:17:49,619
So it was really about embracing this modular development process and pipeline as well.

258
00:17:49,619 --> 00:17:53,921
And that allowed us to ultimately get to the point where we could bring our partners to

259
00:17:53,921 --> 00:17:54,941
work with us.

260
00:17:54,941 --> 00:17:59,582
And we had a robust outsourcing pipeline that by the end of production we were able to actually

261
00:17:59,582 --> 00:18:04,404
send out a rough version of a level in Graybox that had been designed with modules.

262
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:11,112
over to partners overseas in Shanghai and we would get back an alpha quality level at the end.

263
00:18:11,112 --> 00:18:16,699
It required some touch-up and finishing but ultimately was produced with external partners

264
00:18:16,699 --> 00:18:20,804
which was an amazing feat when we have a very high bar for our game.

265
00:18:22,347 --> 00:18:26,908
We had multiple cinematic production companies through production as well, so we worked externally

266
00:18:26,908 --> 00:18:30,829
with a number of partners on over 90 minutes of story content for cinematics.

267
00:18:30,829 --> 00:18:34,250
So it was a very big production overall.

268
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:38,852
I think one of the key things that we did in the last couple of games, including this

269
00:18:38,852 --> 00:18:42,593
one, is this philosophy is know as you go, as I put it.

270
00:18:42,593 --> 00:18:48,115
And essentially we put quality as the premium, which makes it very difficult to schedule.

271
00:18:48,115 --> 00:18:49,495
So ultimately we put...

272
00:18:50,115 --> 00:18:57,585
The emphasis on knowing every step of the way whether we were actually achieving what we wanted to achieve from a quality perspective.

273
00:18:57,585 --> 00:19:08,538
And this allowed us to scope along the way when we were off in time or off in targets and shape and change our production in order to maintain quality and deliver against our high goals.

274
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:14,627
Ultimately, one of the problems we've seen in the past is if you deliver things at 50%

275
00:19:14,627 --> 00:19:18,813
or 60% at alpha and don't take it all the way up, it can be difficult to schedule that

276
00:19:18,813 --> 00:19:20,816
post-production part of the project.

277
00:19:20,816 --> 00:19:24,482
Quite often we see, and I've seen, projects really get to the point...

278
00:19:24,502 --> 00:19:27,484
where they've actually taken too much time in production,

279
00:19:27,484 --> 00:19:32,128
they haven't really understood how long it takes to get to the quality bar they're aiming for,

280
00:19:32,128 --> 00:19:36,873
and ultimately there's a block of time, which is your alpha to bug fixing to shipping,

281
00:19:36,873 --> 00:19:41,156
and that is relatively immovable at that point, because it's very late in the production process.

282
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:49,041
So what we wanted to do on this was essentially not wait to find out exactly what game we were making, but be sure every step of the way.

283
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,522
So it had to be great at every milestone.

284
00:19:51,522 --> 00:19:55,584
And that was really our philosophy on the last few games at Crystal, that ultimately...

285
00:19:56,765 --> 00:20:01,268
If you're not great every step of the way, then don't expect to be great at the end.

286
00:20:01,268 --> 00:20:06,071
So we wanted every milestone to be great and we wanted to know whether we were on or off.

287
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:10,514
And ultimately, even though we use production schedules to drive our metrics

288
00:20:10,514 --> 00:20:15,558
and we use production to really calibrate what we're doing and how fast we're going,

289
00:20:15,558 --> 00:20:15,958
the sticks...

290
00:20:16,418 --> 00:20:19,622
and the screen really are our ultimate production schedule.

291
00:20:19,622 --> 00:20:22,986
And it's about picking up the controller, playing the game, and saying,

292
00:20:22,986 --> 00:20:27,511
is it great? And if not, scope accordingly, change, fix it,

293
00:20:27,511 --> 00:20:29,713
and do whatever we can to get that right.

294
00:20:29,713 --> 00:20:33,778
So we were iterating to make sure that we held up that bar every step of the way.

295
00:20:34,479 --> 00:20:39,641
It's important you don't drink your own Kool-Aid and you're not the one saying it's great, but other people are too.

296
00:20:39,641 --> 00:20:42,463
Ultimately, we're making this for an audience.

297
00:20:42,463 --> 00:20:50,487
So it was important that we also brought that audience into Crystal and we got validation along the way that what we thought was great was actually working for them too.

298
00:20:50,487 --> 00:20:53,109
So we have a focus testing lab at Crystal.

299
00:20:53,689 --> 00:20:59,114
We had focus testing from pre-production all the way through to the end of the production,

300
00:20:59,114 --> 00:21:03,379
roughly every two weeks early on in pre-production, through production,

301
00:21:03,379 --> 00:21:08,664
going down to every week and almost every day as we got through to the end of the project.

302
00:21:08,664 --> 00:21:13,108
And that was key in terms of understanding whether our choices from a design standpoint

303
00:21:13,108 --> 00:21:16,411
were actually working when people got their hands on the sticks.

304
00:21:19,045 --> 00:21:24,186
I think one of the other biggest things we did was build our game as episodic chunks.

305
00:21:24,186 --> 00:21:27,147
And this was a very different way of building.

306
00:21:27,147 --> 00:21:34,070
We had built our game in contiguous chunks of content that were almost products in themselves

307
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:36,330
within a larger production cycle.

308
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:40,212
So they were developed to an alpha quality before we moved on.

309
00:21:40,212 --> 00:21:44,273
And ultimately, if we didn't hit what we felt from a quality standpoint within these chunks,

310
00:21:44,273 --> 00:21:46,574
they were roughly about three hours each.

311
00:21:47,094 --> 00:21:54,241
Then we would iterate until we did and we would scope the remainder of the project to make sure that we still hit our timelines that we needed to.

312
00:21:54,241 --> 00:22:01,888
And this allowed, if we were productizing along the way and essentially making nuggets of product that were three hour chunks,

313
00:22:01,888 --> 00:22:07,153
what we could do is really very clearly see where we were on or we were off and make...

314
00:22:08,317 --> 00:22:13,318
choices along the way. And as we said, it's game development, so it's never perfect and

315
00:22:13,318 --> 00:22:17,139
you're always making choices. So the more knowledge you have and the more data you have

316
00:22:17,139 --> 00:22:21,941
about whether you're on or off from a quality standpoint, if you're putting that as a premium,

317
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:24,161
it allows for better choices down the line.

318
00:22:25,242 --> 00:22:29,985
So we made many scoping decisions along the way around the content at the end of each one of these chunks,

319
00:22:29,985 --> 00:22:32,147
which we're actually going to show shortly some videos of.

320
00:22:32,147 --> 00:22:36,070
We could review it, we could refine at the end of every episode,

321
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:41,114
and we could come back to the next episodic chunk that the whole team was on at any one point

322
00:22:41,114 --> 00:22:42,695
and say, how do we do it better next time?

323
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:47,318
And through that process, it really did get faster and quicker to produce the game.

324
00:22:51,675 --> 00:22:55,796
So moving into pre-production, again, that sense of it being a product really existed

325
00:22:55,796 --> 00:22:57,276
in our first playable.

326
00:22:57,276 --> 00:23:01,997
And ultimately, even though we spent quite a long time looking at different flavors of

327
00:23:01,997 --> 00:23:06,658
the game, and before hanging our hooks on survival, ultimately when we came to doing

328
00:23:06,658 --> 00:23:11,479
our first playable demo, we wanted to make that feel like a product in itself.

329
00:23:11,479 --> 00:23:14,380
And ultimately that had a beginning, middle, and end.

330
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:18,741
It was a 30-minute experience, and we wanted it to feel like you could put it in somebody's

331
00:23:18,741 --> 00:23:21,542
hands, and it was as close to a shipping game as we could make.

332
00:23:22,322 --> 00:23:29,828
So we started that in 2010. It took about five months to develop our first playable demo.

333
00:23:29,828 --> 00:23:38,874
And I think a testament to that is, out of that first playable, it was taken to, as I said, a 30-minute chunk of shippable game almost.

334
00:23:38,874 --> 00:23:42,036
We actually presented that to Game Informer and they were...

335
00:23:42,317 --> 00:23:45,840
We were lucky enough that they put it on the front cover and really embraced what we were

336
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,684
doing because they could see very clearly at that stage what we were making.

337
00:23:49,684 --> 00:23:53,427
So it was definitely one of those things internally, it was a great calibration tool for us to

338
00:23:53,427 --> 00:23:53,767
work with.

339
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:57,871
In terms of approaching it, Noah's going to take a look at the pillars and then we'll

340
00:23:57,871 --> 00:23:59,493
show some short videos as well around it.

341
00:24:00,173 --> 00:24:14,337
Yeah, so as we step through each of these phases of production, I'm just going to give you a few glimpses of some of the key documents we used to capture the creative intent, and also give some snapshots of actually what we were putting on screen.

342
00:24:14,337 --> 00:24:26,660
So, we had this idea of the survival informed origin story, but it was also a Tomb Raider game, so as we, obviously, as we start to set out to make the game itself, understanding how that applies to the gameplay experience is important.

343
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,224
So we've always had the sense of our core pillars in the Tomb Raider franchise.

344
00:24:31,224 --> 00:24:37,730
So traversal, combat, and smart puzzle solving are really our core gameplay mechanics.

345
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:44,015
And as we discussed before, we were going to infuse them with this flavor of survival action.

346
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:47,978
So in the case of traversal, that meant treacherous, dangerous world,

347
00:24:47,978 --> 00:24:53,623
and ultimately less canned controls, less canned jumps, so you really felt at any moment.

348
00:24:53,964 --> 00:24:58,347
you could fail and you were in connection with the character.

349
00:24:58,347 --> 00:25:01,910
In terms of combat, we moved from a lock-based system

350
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:06,293
to a full third-person aim system, but also really tried to capture that sense of desperation.

351
00:25:06,293 --> 00:25:09,676
We were rolling Lara back to a point where she was far less confident

352
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:15,341
and far less competent than people knew her as, and we wanted that to show in her animation and in her mechanics.

353
00:25:15,921 --> 00:25:17,962
And in the case of puzzles, we really

354
00:25:17,962 --> 00:25:21,102
embraced the idea of physics, both for its simulation aspect,

355
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:24,883
but also the idea that it helped players

356
00:25:24,883 --> 00:25:26,744
with an understanding of cause and effect,

357
00:25:26,744 --> 00:25:29,465
that by using fire and water and mass and pulleys,

358
00:25:29,465 --> 00:25:32,305
we could create environmental challenges that really asked

359
00:25:32,305 --> 00:25:35,226
the player to, like we saw in the survival stories,

360
00:25:35,226 --> 00:25:38,647
use what was at hand in order to overcome their obstacles.

361
00:25:38,647 --> 00:25:40,968
So this is very simple.

362
00:25:40,968 --> 00:25:42,748
And you'll see with a lot of these,

363
00:25:42,748 --> 00:25:45,029
it is important to be able to boil things down.

364
00:25:45,449 --> 00:25:49,831
to a very simple view and sort of guide your vision

365
00:25:49,831 --> 00:25:53,813
with very clear and precise concepts.

366
00:25:53,813 --> 00:25:56,494
This is a little more complex, but it's really just

367
00:25:56,494 --> 00:25:58,875
speaking to a philosophy we had, which

368
00:25:58,875 --> 00:26:01,996
was the idea that these gameplay, the spikes

369
00:26:01,996 --> 00:26:04,697
of different colors, really are different gameplay flavors.

370
00:26:04,697 --> 00:26:07,338
But the dotted line represents this experience.

371
00:26:07,338 --> 00:26:10,039
So in a lot of ways, what we were creating

372
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:13,321
was not a sequence of game design challenges,

373
00:26:13,701 --> 00:26:17,324
But really, an experience made up of those challenges.

374
00:26:17,324 --> 00:26:21,388
So that's a philosophy, this idea of variety and intensity

375
00:26:21,388 --> 00:26:23,530
as a function of pacing is something

376
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:25,012
you'll see through all of our docs here.

377
00:26:26,122 --> 00:26:30,283
We're going to take a quick look at actually some of the content that we were putting on

378
00:26:30,283 --> 00:26:31,963
screen at this time.

379
00:26:31,963 --> 00:26:33,524
So this was in mid-2010.

380
00:26:33,524 --> 00:26:39,465
This was cut from probably about 30 minutes of gameplay, and this, we cut it together

381
00:26:39,465 --> 00:26:45,186
at the time, so this was sort of our trailer packaged up, and this helped us both internally

382
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:51,088
see our concepts in practice, but also, as Darrell mentioned, starting to generate support

383
00:26:51,088 --> 00:26:54,248
externally both within the organization and within the press.

384
00:27:14,515 --> 00:27:25,743
You think you know me?

385
00:27:25,743 --> 00:27:27,764
Think you've seen me before?

386
00:27:27,764 --> 00:27:28,624
The Brit Princess.

387
00:27:28,624 --> 00:27:31,806
Rich girl with a pretty face.

388
00:27:42,317 --> 00:27:47,001
and a flair for gymnastics.

389
00:27:47,001 --> 00:27:56,208
I think you've got me mixed up with someone else.

390
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:57,749
I'm not perfect.

391
00:27:57,749 --> 00:28:02,653
I'm not bulletproof.

392
00:28:02,653 --> 00:28:04,874
I struggle.

393
00:28:04,874 --> 00:28:06,736
I bleed.

394
00:28:06,736 --> 00:28:08,497
I get lost.

395
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:27,299
I know pain.

396
00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:28,480
I know fear.

397
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:42,432
One day, I will become a legend.

398
00:28:42,432 --> 00:28:42,873
A warrior.

399
00:28:42,873 --> 00:28:44,374
A raider.

400
00:28:53,476 --> 00:28:59,364
But first, I will be a survivor.

401
00:29:25,167 --> 00:29:37,253
Still think you know me?

402
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:55,161
philosophy really actually showed us very early in production that we were going to

403
00:29:55,161 --> 00:29:59,842
struggle to meet that. So it meant that we could actually communicate to Square and to

404
00:29:59,842 --> 00:30:04,123
the wider group that based on what we wanted to achieve, we did actually have to move the

405
00:30:04,123 --> 00:30:09,124
date. And it wasn't a surprise. It wasn't like it came at alpha. It came fairly early

406
00:30:09,124 --> 00:30:14,545
in production. So even though the date was changed, there was no surprises with that,

407
00:30:14,545 --> 00:30:16,966
which I think is sort of the good moral of that one.

408
00:30:18,306 --> 00:30:21,791
So this wasn't the end of pre-production for us, that was first playable.

409
00:30:21,791 --> 00:30:24,975
But it really had that identity that we wanted.

410
00:30:24,975 --> 00:30:28,480
It was absolutely playable on the sticks as a 30-minute experience.

411
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:33,166
Going into our next phase is what we call vertical slice, which is the last phase before production.

412
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:38,792
This was a seven month period where the team worked on really taking that skeleton and

413
00:30:38,792 --> 00:30:43,436
fleshing it out and putting the meat on the bones to make playable, full playable expressions

414
00:30:43,436 --> 00:30:44,517
of all the pillars.

415
00:30:44,517 --> 00:30:49,182
This amounted to about one and a half to two hours of content at alpha quality.

416
00:30:50,962 --> 00:30:52,583
all the base mechanics were in and implemented.

417
00:30:52,583 --> 00:30:57,266
We didn't think it was going to be, it needed to be two hours, that wasn't really the aim.

418
00:30:57,266 --> 00:31:00,388
The aim was to make sure we had full playable expressions

419
00:31:00,388 --> 00:31:04,551
of all the gameplay patterns that we needed to go on and replicate in production.

420
00:31:04,551 --> 00:31:07,873
So it was a case of making sure we had one of everything.

421
00:31:07,873 --> 00:31:11,996
And because experience was really what we were aiming for, rather than components,

422
00:31:11,996 --> 00:31:16,219
it had to be strung together as a complete narrative start to finish.

423
00:31:16,219 --> 00:31:17,240
So it was contiguous.

424
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:24,926
It represented every part of what we needed to build in production and it ultimately came

425
00:31:24,926 --> 00:31:29,270
as a 1.5 to 2 hour experience which was larger than I guess we planned originally.

426
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:35,776
I guess the good thing from that, again putting quality as a premium and not moving on until

427
00:31:35,776 --> 00:31:39,899
we actually achieved it, is when it came to doing things like demos and actually getting

428
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:43,763
the word out there, we didn't have to do very much which was a good by-product.

429
00:31:44,003 --> 00:31:46,164
One, the team knew internally what they needed to build,

430
00:31:46,164 --> 00:31:50,087
but two, when we got asked to be on stage in 2011

431
00:31:50,087 --> 00:31:54,510
from Microsoft, we said, let's take five minutes or so

432
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:57,272
of our vertical slice and put that on stage.

433
00:31:57,272 --> 00:31:59,873
So literally, the work involved to do a demo

434
00:31:59,873 --> 00:32:03,255
for a Microsoft keynote was a small team of a few people

435
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:06,237
for a few days to really just cut down the content

436
00:32:06,237 --> 00:32:07,758
and say, here you go.

437
00:32:07,758 --> 00:32:09,199
So it was not custom crafted.

438
00:32:09,981 --> 00:32:13,879
So that was a great by-product of taking quality and pushing it hard early.

439
00:32:18,239 --> 00:32:23,022
Another aspect of vertical slice is one of the common challenges in game development,

440
00:32:23,022 --> 00:32:26,804
which is sort of planning at the same time you're putting that hour and a half on screen,

441
00:32:26,804 --> 00:32:30,226
that's a demonstration of your vision, you're planning the whole game.

442
00:32:30,226 --> 00:32:37,910
So for us, it was important for us to come out of that pre-production phase,

443
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:40,332
knowing exactly what we were going to build.

444
00:32:40,332 --> 00:32:44,114
And in some ways that's a challenge just from a documenting perspective.

445
00:32:44,114 --> 00:32:47,756
So I think one of the ways we approached...

446
00:32:48,056 --> 00:32:52,458
this game was to look at it as an experience driven game,

447
00:32:52,458 --> 00:32:55,879
which meant it wasn't really purely a story driven game,

448
00:32:55,879 --> 00:32:57,800
it wasn't purely a gameplay driven game,

449
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,921
it was really all of these things coming together

450
00:32:59,921 --> 00:33:00,901
to create an experience,

451
00:33:00,901 --> 00:33:03,262
because the players really don't experience them

452
00:33:03,262 --> 00:33:04,282
independent of each other.

453
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:06,763
So this document, it's not necessarily important

454
00:33:06,763 --> 00:33:08,004
to see the details,

455
00:33:08,004 --> 00:33:10,104
but the horizontal separators are levels,

456
00:33:10,104 --> 00:33:13,546
so between that would represent about 20 minutes of gameplay,

457
00:33:13,546 --> 00:33:16,467
so each segment was about two minute granularity

458
00:33:16,467 --> 00:33:17,187
at this point.

459
00:33:17,848 --> 00:33:21,551
But looking at the columns, the center column was story beats.

460
00:33:21,551 --> 00:33:26,556
So that was much like just a treatment that you'd have for a game story.

461
00:33:26,556 --> 00:33:30,380
But then as you sort of expanded on that with gameplay concepts,

462
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:33,303
on the right-hand column you have Lara's character arc,

463
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:36,386
because obviously that was very important to us in an origin story.

464
00:33:36,386 --> 00:33:39,429
And then to the right of that, her gameplay progression, so where gear and

465
00:33:39,429 --> 00:33:40,330
abilities came in.

466
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:43,691
And on the left-hand side, you can see the colored bands.

467
00:33:43,691 --> 00:33:47,152
And the one colored band represents the different

468
00:33:47,152 --> 00:33:48,393
flavors of gameplay.

469
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:50,314
And then the grayscale represents the

470
00:33:50,314 --> 00:33:51,194
intensity of that.

471
00:33:51,194 --> 00:33:54,595
So through this documentation process, we were able to

472
00:33:54,595 --> 00:33:58,276
visualize a little bit more richly than just a level

473
00:33:58,276 --> 00:34:00,737
document or a story document might do.

474
00:34:00,737 --> 00:34:03,638
And so we were able to map out and create a framework for the

475
00:34:03,638 --> 00:34:04,398
entire game.

476
00:34:05,399 --> 00:34:11,942
In our case, we were also trying to tell a fairly linear story in a fairly non-linear world.

477
00:34:11,942 --> 00:34:16,205
So this is just an example of then mapping that experience to our spatial layout.

478
00:34:16,205 --> 00:34:23,029
So we chose a hub-based system, which ultimately uses gear for the player to unlock new spaces.

479
00:34:23,029 --> 00:34:27,291
So down the bottom of the page here, you can see the gear that's acquired over time,

480
00:34:27,291 --> 00:34:30,173
and each of those is a key for one of the locked areas.

481
00:34:30,173 --> 00:34:34,355
So by getting new gear, you can see you can progress through the various areas of the game.

482
00:34:34,595 --> 00:34:39,779
So it was just tools like this that allowed us to sort of zoom out and visualize the whole game experience.

483
00:34:39,779 --> 00:34:45,143
But one of the great things about having that sense of a full framework,

484
00:34:45,143 --> 00:34:47,125
all of the disciplines can work within that.

485
00:34:47,125 --> 00:34:51,789
So in a lot of cases you might have art understanding what the region is

486
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:54,751
and being able to concept against the basic themes.

487
00:34:55,031 --> 00:34:57,552
But because we knew Lara's journey,

488
00:34:57,552 --> 00:34:59,072
Art could do exercises like this,

489
00:34:59,072 --> 00:35:01,252
doing a great job of really capturing

490
00:35:01,252 --> 00:35:04,473
not only the physical requirements of the space,

491
00:35:04,473 --> 00:35:06,894
but really the emotional context of where

492
00:35:06,894 --> 00:35:08,174
it is in Lara's journey.

493
00:35:08,174 --> 00:35:11,075
So having that sense of an entire framework

494
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:14,615
and coming out of pre-production with a fairly clear vision

495
00:35:14,615 --> 00:35:17,536
of the whole game was important to us.

496
00:35:17,536 --> 00:35:19,557
But as Joel mentioned, we also had to put it on screen.

497
00:35:19,557 --> 00:35:23,578
So what we'll show you now is probably a five-minute video

498
00:35:23,578 --> 00:35:24,438
cut together of.

499
00:35:25,278 --> 00:35:27,981
an hour and a half of gameplay content.

500
00:35:27,981 --> 00:35:30,564
This was done probably at the beginning of 2011.

501
00:35:30,564 --> 00:35:33,388
So this is still two years before we shipped,

502
00:35:33,388 --> 00:35:36,611
but it represents the first shippable,

503
00:35:36,611 --> 00:35:38,914
essentially shippable content if we had to.

504
00:37:49,139 --> 00:37:51,321
I thought you were alive.

505
00:37:51,321 --> 00:37:54,064
God's got nothing to do with it.

506
00:37:54,064 --> 00:37:55,966
It's good to see you two go.

507
00:37:55,966 --> 00:38:01,052
Sorry, you did a real number on your leg.

508
00:38:01,052 --> 00:38:03,274
No, it looks worse than it is.

509
00:38:23,087 --> 00:38:24,884
Something to pry this open.

510
00:40:19,587 --> 00:40:20,017
R.I.P.

511
00:41:46,586 --> 00:41:46,746
Okay.

512
00:41:46,746 --> 00:41:57,816
So what was great about that, and it's even amazing to look back on in some ways, that

513
00:41:57,816 --> 00:42:01,960
that was two years before our game shipped, and before we even started production.

514
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:07,144
But we had one of everything, we had an hour and a half to two hours in the can, and the

515
00:42:07,144 --> 00:42:10,667
key thing about making a product every step of the way, this was going to ship.

516
00:42:11,328 --> 00:42:13,108
and it had to be treated like that.

517
00:42:13,108 --> 00:42:16,489
So we then had to just move on and make more.

518
00:42:16,489 --> 00:42:20,371
So that was the next phase of production, which was a year.

519
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:23,331
So there was 12 months in production.

520
00:42:23,331 --> 00:42:26,532
We had about 9 hours of content to be produced in that period.

521
00:42:26,532 --> 00:42:29,833
We had sort of an hour and a half to two hours in the can from what you've just seen.

522
00:42:30,474 --> 00:42:34,396
And we were making them in episodes, as I mentioned earlier.

523
00:42:34,396 --> 00:42:36,677
So that represented one episode.

524
00:42:36,677 --> 00:42:41,340
Holistically, the team worked on each episode start to finish,

525
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:45,242
including all the sound, the effects, the usual finishing things.

526
00:42:45,242 --> 00:42:49,064
And each episode, or vertical slice chunk as we called it internally,

527
00:42:49,064 --> 00:42:52,886
really comprised of that same sort of pre-production, production,

528
00:42:52,886 --> 00:42:57,289
alpha, bug fixing, sort of almost a product in itself from start to finish.

529
00:42:58,469 --> 00:43:02,793
I think it's the most important thing is to look at the ratio of time per episode

530
00:43:02,793 --> 00:43:04,635
and know that practice makes perfect.

531
00:43:04,635 --> 00:43:08,538
So if we said that we spent seven months on that first chunk of an hour and a half

532
00:43:08,538 --> 00:43:11,281
and then we had twelve months to do the next nine hours,

533
00:43:11,281 --> 00:43:13,683
that doesn't add up on paper.

534
00:43:14,804 --> 00:43:20,825
as we knew internally. But what we do know is we get better with practice, and what we

535
00:43:20,825 --> 00:43:25,966
had to find out was how quick we could go and how much practice would make perfect.

536
00:43:25,966 --> 00:43:31,128
And ultimately going into production, really we did. And one of the key things to that

537
00:43:31,128 --> 00:43:36,549
was building expertise around each discipline and around each pillar. So we had these pillars

538
00:43:36,549 --> 00:43:42,411
of traversal, combat, puzzles, and some other ones outside that, such as hubs and effects.

539
00:43:43,211 --> 00:43:47,834
music, but ultimately the key pillars, we actually built teams around that were multidisciplinary

540
00:43:47,834 --> 00:43:52,917
that had their own leads and they had their own ownership over a piece of the experience

541
00:43:52,917 --> 00:43:57,620
that was mapped to that larger, broader strokes in the documentation Noah was going through.

542
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:02,202
And ultimately as each team worked on a pillar, they became better and better and faster and

543
00:44:02,202 --> 00:44:02,623
faster.

544
00:44:02,623 --> 00:44:08,626
So, over the course of production, the first hour and a half to two hours was about seven

545
00:44:08,626 --> 00:44:09,327
months.

546
00:44:09,507 --> 00:44:13,471
The second one was around six months, five to six months of that year.

547
00:44:13,471 --> 00:44:18,195
The third, and these are all three hour increments moving into production, the third one was

548
00:44:18,195 --> 00:44:21,499
around three and a half months and the last one was about two and a half months.

549
00:44:21,499 --> 00:44:25,803
So by the end of production of that year, the team, along with all the external partners

550
00:44:25,803 --> 00:44:28,946
we had brought on to help us through production, was moving at

551
00:44:29,186 --> 00:44:35,770
3 hours of content in around 2-3 months versus 7 months for an hour and a half of content

552
00:44:35,770 --> 00:44:37,211
in vertical slice.

553
00:44:37,211 --> 00:44:41,694
So what it allowed us to do, as I said earlier, at the end of each episodic chunk was actually

554
00:44:41,694 --> 00:44:45,996
make decisions and scope and really learn how much gain we could produce in the time

555
00:44:45,996 --> 00:44:47,197
whilst maintaining quality.

556
00:44:47,197 --> 00:44:51,440
And ultimately production was comprised of what you just saw 4 times over.

557
00:44:52,913 --> 00:44:58,938
We had 250 cinematic moments and 90 minutes of custom storytelling cinematics.

558
00:44:58,938 --> 00:45:02,101
So it was a large cinematic pipeline that we produced in that year as well.

559
00:45:02,101 --> 00:45:08,406
And ultimately we had teams around the world working for that year, producing content for the production phase.

560
00:45:08,406 --> 00:45:16,113
So teams in San Francisco, obviously with our sister studio in Montreal, Shanghai, India, L.A. and a number of other places.

561
00:45:16,113 --> 00:45:17,974
But you name it.

562
00:45:18,235 --> 00:45:20,819
we brought them on board and said let's get this done.

563
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:24,104
So it was done in a year period and that really brought us to Alpha.

564
00:45:24,104 --> 00:45:26,688
So quick docs, I'm just going to flick through them.

565
00:45:27,992 --> 00:45:30,874
in terms of scheduling, because we were building in patterns,

566
00:45:30,874 --> 00:45:32,875
ultimately we could actually schedule out

567
00:45:32,875 --> 00:45:35,336
what are the patterns and what do we need to repeat.

568
00:45:35,336 --> 00:45:38,098
And each level was comprised of those patterns

569
00:45:38,098 --> 00:45:40,059
that we could then take from vertical slice

570
00:45:40,059 --> 00:45:42,760
and almost sort of map to production and say

571
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:45,882
it's kind of like this, but with a different wrapper.

572
00:45:45,882 --> 00:45:48,463
And ultimately those patterns we could then cost against.

573
00:45:48,463 --> 00:45:50,544
So, I'm not going to go in detail through this,

574
00:45:50,544 --> 00:45:52,005
but again, similar to Noah's document,

575
00:45:52,005 --> 00:45:53,606
from a production standpoint,

576
00:45:53,606 --> 00:45:55,046
we added up the costs.

577
00:45:55,407 --> 00:45:58,368
associated to each beat or each moment we produced

578
00:45:58,368 --> 00:46:01,410
and we broke down each beat and moment throughout the whole game

579
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:03,111
and then applied a cost to it.

580
00:46:03,111 --> 00:46:06,833
Ultimately, you're never right with documentation when you start out

581
00:46:06,833 --> 00:46:09,555
and we refined it over time and became more and more accurate

582
00:46:09,555 --> 00:46:11,296
about what we could produce in the time we had.

583
00:46:12,096 --> 00:46:19,858
The other key thing is understanding where you're at at any one period in time and having a team all understand it too.

584
00:46:19,858 --> 00:46:24,199
And one of the things when you've got a lot of people with their heads down producing content,

585
00:46:24,199 --> 00:46:29,280
just saying, here's what we need to be done and being clear about it is very, very important.

586
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:34,621
So we actually lined the internal team up all around the same milestones rather than have a lot of...

587
00:46:36,646 --> 00:46:41,112
I guess cross-hatching if you say in a schedule where people are finishing things at different

588
00:46:41,112 --> 00:46:41,292
times.

589
00:46:41,292 --> 00:46:46,499
We really tried to finish everybody at the same time on the end of each vertical slice

590
00:46:46,499 --> 00:46:50,986
chunk of content so everybody knew when done was and what done looked like.

591
00:46:50,986 --> 00:46:53,930
It had to look like our first vertical slice repeated.

592
00:46:57,592 --> 00:47:00,914
Yeah, and as Darrell mentioned, working with those patterns was important.

593
00:47:00,914 --> 00:47:05,796
So from a creative perspective, we had the Uber doc, which mapped out the whole game,

594
00:47:05,796 --> 00:47:10,318
but it was a higher level of detail than you would want to actually produce the content.

595
00:47:10,318 --> 00:47:12,859
So as we zoomed in, this represents a beat doc.

596
00:47:12,859 --> 00:47:16,120
So for every level we would do, we would do a beat doc for about.

597
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:20,642
20 minutes of gameplay, you'd have about 10 plus pages.

598
00:47:20,642 --> 00:47:24,223
So the first page is something you'd find in a lot of docs,

599
00:47:24,223 --> 00:47:26,684
probably the setting, premise.

600
00:47:26,684 --> 00:47:28,585
We're tracking Lara's emotional arc as well,

601
00:47:28,585 --> 00:47:30,566
because that was important to us.

602
00:47:30,566 --> 00:47:33,747
Gameplay mechanics, enemies that you'd find in the level.

603
00:47:33,747 --> 00:47:36,108
So a fairly standard overview.

604
00:47:36,108 --> 00:47:39,429
But then on the lower right-hand side of the screen,

605
00:47:39,429 --> 00:47:41,950
you can see sort of the first beat laid out.

606
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:44,811
And it was important for us to actually.

607
00:47:45,372 --> 00:47:49,994
from on a moment to moment basis describe what the player was doing rather than just

608
00:47:49,994 --> 00:47:52,275
frame the high level goals.

609
00:47:52,275 --> 00:47:57,238
And that was a bit of a culture shift for us as well because in a lot of ways developers

610
00:47:57,238 --> 00:48:01,040
like having a bit of a blank canvas but the good news with putting something in place

611
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:05,622
is that you know you have an answer and that answer can always get better.

612
00:48:05,622 --> 00:48:07,163
So in the beats we'd also put.

613
00:48:07,784 --> 00:48:12,347
goals or conditions of satisfaction. So not only did we have sort of our starting point,

614
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:16,531
but we understood what this beat was trying to achieve so that as we iterated and as we

615
00:48:16,531 --> 00:48:20,314
improved upon it, we could make sure that we were still achieving those goals.

616
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:26,138
We had to map out levels spatially, so obviously paper maps are fairly standard, but really

617
00:48:26,138 --> 00:48:31,263
pairing design with art as well. And Darrell talked about those cross-disciplinary teams.

618
00:48:31,603 --> 00:48:35,344
it's great to get in and really think about the same thing at the same time.

619
00:48:35,344 --> 00:48:39,145
So something on the left is an example of a key art image that would really help capture

620
00:48:39,145 --> 00:48:43,566
the person, a moment of the level, but also the personality so that as we're talking about

621
00:48:43,566 --> 00:48:47,807
what's going on we can all visual, visualize ourselves in that space.

622
00:48:47,807 --> 00:48:51,048
And then on the right hand side you see sort of our beat boards,

623
00:48:51,048 --> 00:48:57,630
which any moment where we had heavy character performance, scripted action, cameras, that

624
00:48:57,790 --> 00:49:00,952
we tended to get much better results when we took the time

625
00:49:00,952 --> 00:49:03,915
to go through the process of doing these beat boards.

626
00:49:03,915 --> 00:49:07,177
Sometimes it feels, especially when you've only got two months

627
00:49:07,177 --> 00:49:10,160
left to do three hours of gameplay,

628
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:14,203
that skipping some of these steps is an efficiency.

629
00:49:14,203 --> 00:49:17,346
But in the end, for us, it really wasn't.

630
00:49:17,346 --> 00:49:19,207
Speaking of cinematics, just a quick glimpse

631
00:49:19,207 --> 00:49:20,548
at our cinematic pipeline, because that

632
00:49:20,548 --> 00:49:24,591
was slightly different from the in-game performance moments,

633
00:49:24,591 --> 00:49:26,153
that we did motion capture.

634
00:49:26,153 --> 00:49:26,193
So.

635
00:49:27,334 --> 00:49:30,176
Once we had that full uber doc describing the game,

636
00:49:30,176 --> 00:49:31,136
we could write the script.

637
00:49:31,136 --> 00:49:34,199
So that looks like any TV or movie script.

638
00:49:34,199 --> 00:49:37,401
In our case, we had to extract any props, any set design

639
00:49:37,401 --> 00:49:38,462
elements.

640
00:49:38,462 --> 00:49:40,383
So in this case, we're looking at a scene that

641
00:49:40,383 --> 00:49:41,564
takes place in Himiko's tomb.

642
00:49:41,564 --> 00:49:44,186
This is the first tomb that Lara raids.

643
00:49:44,847 --> 00:49:49,652
We would build that out, measure it out, because when we got down to LA, this is the capture volume,

644
00:49:49,652 --> 00:49:55,479
there's actually a grid on the floor and all that junk around Lara really represents elements in the 3D world,

645
00:49:55,479 --> 00:49:59,243
so she could be aware of that environment.

646
00:49:59,243 --> 00:50:00,865
You'll also notice that she has...

647
00:50:01,225 --> 00:50:03,626
cameras mounted in front of her on her helmet.

648
00:50:03,626 --> 00:50:05,646
So we didn't actually capture face data,

649
00:50:05,646 --> 00:50:08,427
but we got frame by frame reference for the animators.

650
00:50:08,427 --> 00:50:10,768
So we were capturing full body data,

651
00:50:10,768 --> 00:50:13,569
and then we were using that face information

652
00:50:13,569 --> 00:50:14,329
for animation reference.

653
00:50:14,329 --> 00:50:16,630
You can see in the background, there's some monitors.

654
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:20,392
So as Lara's acting out a scene, we

655
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:22,032
can see something like this on the monitors.

656
00:50:22,032 --> 00:50:23,273
It's extremely rough.

657
00:50:26,012 --> 00:50:29,494
But the other great thing about this is it becomes a previs for that scene.

658
00:50:29,494 --> 00:50:34,796
So even out of our rehearsal shoots, we would get something like this and then could plug it into the game.

659
00:50:34,796 --> 00:50:40,699
And then now that story element is starting to be represented in the game experience.

660
00:50:40,699 --> 00:50:48,523
Once we get effects, lighting, sound, face, hands, all of the additional layers we put on,

661
00:50:48,523 --> 00:50:54,545
our cinematic should look something like this.

662
00:50:54,545 --> 00:50:55,606
I hate tombs.

663
00:51:01,754 --> 00:51:05,498
So as Darryl mentioned, we went through basically three

664
00:51:05,498 --> 00:51:06,459
versions of that production.

665
00:51:06,459 --> 00:51:08,422
And we really did hit our stride.

666
00:51:08,422 --> 00:51:10,905
But part of being able to hit our stride was sticking to

667
00:51:10,905 --> 00:51:13,769
those patterns, that when we visualized a new scene, we

668
00:51:13,769 --> 00:51:15,811
needed to see it through the lens of something we had

669
00:51:15,811 --> 00:51:16,432
already done.

670
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:20,891
Okay, so that brings us into our final third.

671
00:51:20,891 --> 00:51:23,811
We're gonna run through that very, very quickly here.

672
00:51:23,811 --> 00:51:25,712
So we had a 12 month period where we had

673
00:51:25,712 --> 00:51:28,873
those four chunks of content in the can

674
00:51:28,873 --> 00:51:30,093
and we could play it start to finish

675
00:51:30,093 --> 00:51:32,613
and it was already at a very good quality level.

676
00:51:32,613 --> 00:51:36,094
But we knew that we wanted to edit what we had on paper

677
00:51:36,094 --> 00:51:39,135
and make it better once we actually saw it in the flesh.

678
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:40,675
So we built time in for that.

679
00:51:40,675 --> 00:51:42,756
And that 12 month period was basically split

680
00:51:42,756 --> 00:51:46,696
six months into editing and six months into bug fixing.

681
00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:50,760
And ultimately that six month period of editing is gold, right?

682
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:55,564
I guess I would just say that, that without that we would not be able to realize the game

683
00:51:55,564 --> 00:51:59,808
that we wanted to because going from your idea of what a game is at 10 to 12 hours to

684
00:51:59,808 --> 00:52:04,953
reality it's always going to be slightly off when you actually see it and play it through.

685
00:52:04,953 --> 00:52:09,116
So it gave us a chance to actually go through, play it ourselves, use usability to actually

686
00:52:09,116 --> 00:52:09,857
give us feedback.

687
00:52:10,137 --> 00:52:12,599
and essentially go through and edit that content.

688
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:15,301
And then the last six months really were polish, polish,

689
00:52:15,301 --> 00:52:19,264
polish, and heavy playtesting, heavy fixing of bugs

690
00:52:19,264 --> 00:52:23,306
to make it a polished gem that we wanted it to be.

691
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:25,748
And it was a great opportunity to have that time.

692
00:52:25,748 --> 00:52:28,050
A lot of times, it's all we can do to just fix the bugs.

693
00:52:28,050 --> 00:52:30,652
So to have some time to actually sculpt the experience.

694
00:52:30,652 --> 00:52:32,793
And I would say that even though we

695
00:52:32,793 --> 00:52:35,875
tried to make each vertical slice as finished as possible,

696
00:52:36,155 --> 00:52:42,640
There's certain things that you can only sort of identify, like overall pacing and character arc, once it's all in place.

697
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:47,463
So inherently there's some improvements that can be made on any game at this phase if you leave yourself the time.

698
00:52:47,463 --> 00:52:50,625
But we wanted to, I guess, make the best use of that time.

699
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:55,669
So here's just another quick document, and this should look familiar because it's very similar to the Uber document,

700
00:52:55,669 --> 00:52:59,231
but whereas the first document we looked at represented our intent.

701
00:52:59,652 --> 00:53:01,512
This is actually our actuals.

702
00:53:01,512 --> 00:53:03,912
So every square is a minute of gameplay.

703
00:53:03,912 --> 00:53:06,173
And again, it's color coded by the type of gameplay

704
00:53:06,173 --> 00:53:07,573
and the experience.

705
00:53:07,573 --> 00:53:10,893
This was valuable because games are fairly intangible,

706
00:53:10,893 --> 00:53:12,874
and the script doesn't really represent the game.

707
00:53:12,874 --> 00:53:13,914
So when you're sitting there and you're

708
00:53:13,914 --> 00:53:16,454
talking about how do we sculpt this experience,

709
00:53:16,454 --> 00:53:18,295
it's really nice to have something,

710
00:53:18,295 --> 00:53:20,695
a tangible representation of that experience.

711
00:53:20,695 --> 00:53:22,155
So this is zoomed way out.

712
00:53:22,155 --> 00:53:24,256
You can see that's our 10-hour experience,

713
00:53:24,256 --> 00:53:26,936
or our 10-hour core experience, laid left to right

714
00:53:26,936 --> 00:53:28,036
with all of the.

715
00:53:29,217 --> 00:53:32,779
I guess, progression along the bottom there.

716
00:53:32,779 --> 00:53:35,401
Now, that was just basically assessing where we were at.

717
00:53:35,401 --> 00:53:37,603
But in terms of informing iteration,

718
00:53:37,603 --> 00:53:39,804
we really relied heavily on play testing

719
00:53:39,804 --> 00:53:41,165
throughout this whole process.

720
00:53:41,165 --> 00:53:46,189
So qualitatively asking questions about, do you enjoy

721
00:53:46,189 --> 00:53:46,649
this?

722
00:53:46,649 --> 00:53:48,230
Is this too difficult?

723
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:49,831
Or in this case, story comprehension.

724
00:53:49,831 --> 00:53:51,533
So we'd have multiple people come in,

725
00:53:51,533 --> 00:53:53,514
play through the entire game, ask them

726
00:53:53,514 --> 00:53:54,995
questions at various points.

727
00:53:54,995 --> 00:53:57,517
And in this case, we identified some issues.

728
00:53:58,217 --> 00:54:02,119
Lower comprehension in the beginning is fine because Lara is thrust into a crazy situation

729
00:54:02,119 --> 00:54:04,040
and she doesn't even know what's going on.

730
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:08,181
But that dip at the end was a problem, that we didn't want people to not understand what

731
00:54:08,181 --> 00:54:09,902
was going on at the end of the story.

732
00:54:09,902 --> 00:54:16,705
So ultimately we did a lot of rewrites at the outset of our post-production process,

733
00:54:16,705 --> 00:54:18,325
but then we would validate those changes.

734
00:54:18,325 --> 00:54:22,907
So a subsequent play test gave us this graph, and we're like, excellent.

735
00:54:22,907 --> 00:54:24,328
We definitely made some improvements.

736
00:54:24,608 --> 00:54:27,290
And there's still a couple points that we could then identify and say,

737
00:54:27,290 --> 00:54:30,873
all right, now let's go address that.

738
00:54:30,873 --> 00:54:36,138
And so the idea of informing your refinements through playtesting

739
00:54:36,138 --> 00:54:38,920
and validating your changes through playtesting was essential.

740
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:40,702
And just one other component with that process,

741
00:54:40,702 --> 00:54:43,064
which is in addition to asking them questions,

742
00:54:43,064 --> 00:54:45,226
we were also capturing data over the network.

743
00:54:45,886 --> 00:54:47,408
regardless of what they said about a level,

744
00:54:47,408 --> 00:54:49,951
we could see things like how much damage they were taking

745
00:54:49,951 --> 00:54:51,833
in a space or how many deaths.

746
00:54:51,833 --> 00:54:54,856
And that really helped us with the tuning and balancing

747
00:54:54,856 --> 00:54:55,917
aspect of it.

748
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:59,120
So I guess the key is leave yourself that time

749
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:00,982
to iterate and make your game really

750
00:55:00,982 --> 00:55:02,404
what it wants to be in the end.

751
00:55:05,648 --> 00:55:12,212
So finally just wrapping up, I guess it's great to give you a broad view. There's some more detailed talks as I said around Tomb Raider today.

752
00:55:12,212 --> 00:55:22,478
So please go see those. I want to leave you with some pro tips but one of which is that it really is a team effort and Noah and I get to represent the team up here.

753
00:55:22,478 --> 00:55:32,684
But ultimately it was a team that made this happen and the team really had the drive and passion to go through all the different challenges you get in development to produce the game we produced.

754
00:55:32,984 --> 00:55:37,445
So it is not as effortless as what you see in this PowerPoint, as I'm sure you all know.

755
00:55:37,445 --> 00:55:44,326
But the pro tips really to leave you with, really that know as you go, I'm going to show you one last video just after this to wrap up.

756
00:55:44,326 --> 00:55:51,928
But knowing at every step of the way what game you are making and whether it's good or not, whether you're hitting your goals, your quality bar, was critical.

757
00:55:51,928 --> 00:55:56,889
And it's been critical for the last couple of projects at Crystal in the way that we've produced them.

758
00:55:56,889 --> 00:56:00,049
So being great at every step is critical.

759
00:56:00,049 --> 00:56:01,570
Knowing that you're great at every step.

760
00:56:01,610 --> 00:56:08,074
knowing you're getting what you want and not waiting until alpha to find out and find out you haven't got enough time to make it great.

761
00:56:08,074 --> 00:56:13,737
The cross-discipline teams around pillars was a key change that we made in terms of how we produced the content,

762
00:56:13,737 --> 00:56:18,560
fitting into a larger macro map of the narrative and gameplay experience.

763
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:27,166
And with this ownership and this expertise, it really gave us the quality but also the speed to produce content that we need to in that production phase.

764
00:56:27,166 --> 00:56:30,608
Lastly, we went through the post-production phase, but you can't shortchange that.

765
00:56:30,888 --> 00:56:34,070
You're never going to get the game you want when you see it at alpha.

766
00:56:34,070 --> 00:56:37,592
So build time in to get the game you want post-alpha.

767
00:56:37,592 --> 00:56:39,253
Don't just bug fix and put it out the door.

768
00:56:39,253 --> 00:56:41,815
So that's really a key tip for us.

769
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:45,477
And ultimately that bug fixing and play testing all the way through to the end,

770
00:56:45,477 --> 00:56:48,759
I mean it really is what makes a polished, refined experience.

771
00:56:48,759 --> 00:56:50,460
So don't shortchange that as well.

772
00:56:50,981 --> 00:56:54,406
Lastly, I'll just leave you with a short video which is really the culmination of all the work,

773
00:56:54,406 --> 00:56:56,969
which is a trailer we put out just before Christmas.

774
00:56:56,969 --> 00:57:02,297
But I think the key thing to look at with that know-as-you-go mentality is at the end,

775
00:57:02,297 --> 00:57:04,480
it's very close to what we had three years ago.

776
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:05,742
And I hope you can see that through this too.

777
00:57:05,822 --> 00:57:10,606
and through the production of this game that every step of the way it really wasn't too

778
00:57:10,606 --> 00:57:14,590
far off. You could squint a little bit at the beginning in the first playable but from

779
00:57:14,590 --> 00:57:18,953
then on it was the real deal and ultimately that really allowed us to scope and manage

780
00:57:18,953 --> 00:57:23,457
our project as we went. It wasn't on rails but it gave us the feedback and the input

781
00:57:23,457 --> 00:57:26,600
we needed to make the right choices in order to hit our dates and our quality. So I'll

782
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:29,322
leave you with that and say thank you for joining us.

783
00:57:29,983 --> 00:57:36,787
And I don't know if we have time for full audience questions, but Daryl and I will hang out.

784
00:57:36,787 --> 00:57:56,439
So if anybody has questions about the process or Crystal or anything.

785
00:57:56,439 --> 00:57:56,819
Thank you.

786
00:57:59,578 --> 00:58:05,201
So much has happened.

787
00:58:05,201 --> 00:58:09,863
I have no response.

788
00:58:09,863 --> 00:58:16,426
Our captain is injured.

789
00:58:16,426 --> 00:58:18,247
Have you heard from any of the others?

790
00:58:18,247 --> 00:58:18,927
Nothing.

791
00:58:18,927 --> 00:58:21,808
Our crew is scattered.

792
00:58:21,808 --> 00:58:23,269
I have a bad feeling about this.

793
00:58:26,906 --> 00:58:30,012
were hunted by the island's inhabitants.

794
00:58:30,012 --> 00:58:31,254
Kara!

795
00:58:31,254 --> 00:58:33,478
Please don't get locked up!

796
00:58:33,478 --> 00:58:34,019
Sam!

797
00:58:34,019 --> 00:58:35,723
Listen!

798
00:58:35,723 --> 00:58:37,687
I'm gonna get you out of there!

799
00:59:11,121 --> 00:59:12,843
You're a croft.

800
00:59:12,843 --> 00:59:16,567
I don't think I'm that kind of croft.

801
00:59:16,567 --> 00:59:19,130
Sure you are.

802
00:59:19,130 --> 00:59:24,516
You just don't know it yet.

803
00:59:24,516 --> 00:59:32,265
Alright, let's do this.

804
00:59:51,552 --> 00:59:55,293
Sometimes you've got to make sacrifices, Lara.

805
00:59:55,293 --> 00:59:57,854
You can't save everyone.

00:59:57,854 --> 01:00:00,195
There's no other choice.

807

I've got to do this.

808
01:00:01,015 --> 01:00:05,657

01:00:05,657 --> 01:00:15,681
None of us will.
