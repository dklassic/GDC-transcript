1
00:00:05,182 --> 00:00:07,283
Thank you for coming to our session.

2
00:00:08,444 --> 00:00:09,265
I'm Sid Meier.

3
00:00:09,485 --> 00:00:10,426
This is Bruce Shelley.

4
00:00:10,446 --> 00:00:11,526
Thank you.

5
00:00:11,546 --> 00:00:12,988
Thank you.

6
00:00:13,108 --> 00:00:14,168
Thank you.

7
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:15,309
Thank you.

8
00:00:15,369 --> 00:00:17,691
Thank you.

9
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:20,793
Thank you.

10
00:00:22,395 --> 00:00:22,655
Thank you.

11
00:00:22,675 --> 00:00:22,855
Thank you.

12
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:23,055
Thank you.

13
00:00:23,075 --> 00:00:23,375
Thank you.

14
00:00:23,395 --> 00:00:23,776
Thank you.

15
00:00:23,856 --> 00:00:24,376
Thank you.

16
00:00:24,516 --> 00:00:26,157
And we're gonna take you back in time to 1990,

17
00:00:26,198 --> 00:00:28,379
a time when there was no civilization,

18
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,421
a time before civilization.

19
00:00:31,512 --> 00:00:36,113
and kind of talk about the process that Bruce and I went

20
00:00:36,133 --> 00:00:40,615
through to create this game called Civilization.

21
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:47,197
And we will get to our next slide here somehow or not.

22
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:52,619
There we go.

23
00:00:54,348 --> 00:00:59,811
So, the approach we want to take is kind of talk about the thought process that we went through

24
00:00:59,831 --> 00:01:09,255
to create the game. With the hindsight of 25 years, a lot of things that we did seemed to be the

25
00:01:09,295 --> 00:01:13,577
right thing to do. Some of the things we did turned out to be the wrong thing to do. But we

26
00:01:13,617 --> 00:01:18,099
would like to justify even the wrong things, explain why we did them that way, and what we

27
00:01:18,139 --> 00:01:21,841
were thinking at the time. It was kind of a...

28
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:26,144
audacious game for us to make.

29
00:01:26,224 --> 00:01:29,505
And the idea that we were gonna kind of compress

30
00:01:30,005 --> 00:01:33,686
the entire history of civilization into a computer game,

31
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:38,548
not only the actual history, but every possible history

32
00:01:38,568 --> 00:01:40,208
that could have happened of civilization,

33
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:43,149
we were trying to put into this game.

34
00:01:44,109 --> 00:01:48,711
It was a time when we were young and audacious.

35
00:01:49,531 --> 00:01:52,073
And we had just finished Railroad Tycoon,

36
00:01:52,093 --> 00:01:55,136
which is kind of the first God game that we worked on.

37
00:01:56,417 --> 00:01:58,038
We were working on Covert Action,

38
00:01:58,098 --> 00:02:00,680
which was an attempt to write

39
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,782
a computer-generated mystery novel.

40
00:02:03,202 --> 00:02:04,203
Didn't quite turn out that way,

41
00:02:04,263 --> 00:02:06,365
but that was kind of our goal at the beginning.

42
00:02:06,425 --> 00:02:07,586
We had just finished Pirates,

43
00:02:07,626 --> 00:02:09,727
which was one of the very first open-world kind of games.

44
00:02:09,767 --> 00:02:12,810
So it was a time when we were

45
00:02:13,651 --> 00:02:16,373
We thought we could do anything and sure,

46
00:02:16,413 --> 00:02:18,014
let's take on the history of civilization

47
00:02:18,074 --> 00:02:19,195
and make a game out of that.

48
00:02:19,856 --> 00:02:22,898
Both Bruce and I are kind of interested in history

49
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:26,941
and have a background in war gaming and other things

50
00:02:26,961 --> 00:02:28,583
which kind of ended up showing up

51
00:02:28,683 --> 00:02:29,984
in the game of civilization.

52
00:02:30,064 --> 00:02:34,247
But the way that I remember the,

53
00:02:34,928 --> 00:02:37,350
for those of you that are not familiar with civilization,

54
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,331
it's the game about world history, okay.

55
00:02:41,843 --> 00:02:47,156
It starts in the Stone Age and you end up by going to Alpha Centauri, taking humanity

56
00:02:47,216 --> 00:02:48,038
into space.

57
00:02:49,281 --> 00:02:50,985
6,000 years of human history.

58
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:52,940
in 640K.

59
00:02:54,321 --> 00:02:57,684
So the, as I remember the story, Bruce and I were,

60
00:02:57,704 --> 00:03:01,327
I remember us riding on a train up to New York, I think,

61
00:03:01,407 --> 00:03:04,790
and we had recently completed Railroad Tycoon,

62
00:03:05,751 --> 00:03:07,572
and really enjoyed that experience,

63
00:03:07,592 --> 00:03:10,875
that kind of God game-ish, start with something small,

64
00:03:11,035 --> 00:03:11,416
build it.

65
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:16,758
Use your own creativity to basically tell a different story every time you play.

66
00:03:17,618 --> 00:03:21,920
The idea of different systems kind of working together, the operation of the railroads,

67
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,501
the building of the railroads, the financing of the railroads,

68
00:03:25,481 --> 00:03:28,502
maintaining your locomotives, routing your trains,

69
00:03:29,523 --> 00:03:35,365
lots of fun little pieces that kind of came together to make a lot of interesting decisions.

70
00:03:36,345 --> 00:03:40,067
And we were looking for another topic that would have those

71
00:03:40,127 --> 00:03:41,248
kind of qualities to it.

72
00:03:42,028 --> 00:03:46,690
And somehow we thought, well, history has a lot of that

73
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:47,530
going on.

74
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:52,332
And it's kind of the ultimate God game, starting with one

75
00:03:52,893 --> 00:03:57,375
little village back in 4000 BC and seeing how far we could go

76
00:03:57,415 --> 00:03:57,635
with it.

77
00:03:59,538 --> 00:04:02,327
That's how I remember it. I'm not sure Bruce how you remember it.

78
00:04:02,347 --> 00:04:05,478
I just remember we talked a lot about that kind of stuff.

79
00:04:07,143 --> 00:04:12,747
Sid always had like a half a dozen prototypes on his computer. He was always noodling a new game idea, you know

80
00:04:12,787 --> 00:04:17,690
And now we look at it. He'd we talk about it. Maybe he's something he wouldn't tell me about it. Then I remember

81
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:20,291
These conversations went on we played a lot of

82
00:04:21,012 --> 00:04:24,974
Empire deluxe and we talked about you gave me a task to come up with ten things

83
00:04:25,094 --> 00:04:30,577
I would change about Empire deluxe if I could change anything and trying to be a progressive person

84
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:33,439
I came up with 12 and gave him the list and

85
00:04:33,619 --> 00:04:35,801
and and then one day

86
00:04:37,351 --> 00:04:40,293
a disc pops into my desk, and I have it at home.

87
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:43,455
It's a five and a quarter inch floppy disc from May of 1990,

88
00:04:43,936 --> 00:04:46,317
and it's the first playable version of Civilization

89
00:04:46,357 --> 00:04:48,278
anybody had ever seen other than his computer.

90
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:50,580
I saved this as a historic artifact.

91
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,281
I hadn't saved the first version of Railroad Deck,

92
00:04:52,341 --> 00:04:54,563
and I determined to save whatever was coming down

93
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,064
the pipe next, I'd save the first version.

94
00:04:56,084 --> 00:04:57,325
So that's my memory.

95
00:04:57,345 --> 00:04:58,906
We had played all these other games,

96
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:01,848
and then this came together enough for you to feel

97
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:03,569
that it was good enough for somebody else to look at.

98
00:05:04,692 --> 00:05:10,754
Yeah, I think we need to give credit to Empire as part of the inspiration for Civ, also SimCity,

99
00:05:11,214 --> 00:05:12,294
also Railroad Tycoon.

100
00:05:12,434 --> 00:05:16,676
There's also a board game actually called Civilization that was out there at the time.

101
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:17,256
We played that.

102
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:17,756
We played that.

103
00:05:17,836 --> 00:05:21,538
Francis Trusham designed it in England and Avalon Hill had published an American version

104
00:05:21,558 --> 00:05:21,718
of it.

105
00:05:22,837 --> 00:05:24,617
We stirred all those ingredients together.

106
00:05:25,538 --> 00:05:27,739
We're going to claim that the topic was one of the things we

107
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:30,980
did right in Civilization, that it was a good topic.

108
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,502
It really lent itself to the kind of games we wanted to

109
00:05:34,522 --> 00:05:37,163
make and the place we were with the technology.

110
00:05:37,864 --> 00:05:38,965
in those games.

111
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,067
And also it had a huge potential audience.

112
00:05:41,087 --> 00:05:43,609
I mean, one of my talking points over the years has been

113
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:46,432
when you start a project, your potential customer

114
00:05:46,932 --> 00:05:49,635
is everybody who has the platform that game is gonna be on.

115
00:05:49,675 --> 00:05:51,577
But as soon as you make decisions about what that game is about,

116
00:05:51,877 --> 00:05:53,539
you start to shrink your potential audience.

117
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:56,161
Well, the history of civilization is a pretty big topic,

118
00:05:56,221 --> 00:05:58,223
so we had a huge potential audience.

119
00:05:58,263 --> 00:06:00,605
Remember, later on when Sid gave the first presentation

120
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:01,846
I ever heard about game design.

121
00:06:02,719 --> 00:06:04,801
He, one of his topic points was choose a big topic.

122
00:06:04,841 --> 00:06:06,262
I said, I think we'd already made Civilization

123
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:07,123
by that time, I'm not sure, but I said,

124
00:06:07,143 --> 00:06:08,004
well, there can't be a bigger one

125
00:06:08,024 --> 00:06:09,406
than the history of Civilization.

126
00:06:10,267 --> 00:06:13,150
Yeah, we talk about trying to make games epic.

127
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,711
The fact that it really doesn't cost any more

128
00:06:15,172 --> 00:06:17,835
to make a game epic than to make it non-epic.

129
00:06:20,063 --> 00:06:23,604
So the next thing that we kind of had to figure out

130
00:06:23,644 --> 00:06:25,624
was how are we gonna approach this topic?

131
00:06:25,744 --> 00:06:27,785
Obviously there could be many, many different games

132
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:29,605
written on the topic of civilization.

133
00:06:29,645 --> 00:06:32,206
So how are we gonna approach this?

134
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:36,207
One of the ideas that really, I think, paid off for us

135
00:06:36,807 --> 00:06:39,368
was the idea of starting very small

136
00:06:39,448 --> 00:06:41,428
with that first settler, that first city.

137
00:06:43,049 --> 00:06:44,389
The topic could be intimidating.

138
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:51,652
So I think allowing you to start with a very simple problem,

139
00:06:52,052 --> 00:06:55,053
very simple situation, founding that first city,

140
00:06:55,153 --> 00:06:58,335
that led to something else, the first settler,

141
00:06:58,415 --> 00:07:00,295
the first unit, exploring.

142
00:07:01,496 --> 00:07:03,017
So that was one of the ideas that we had

143
00:07:03,717 --> 00:07:05,538
in terms of the tone and the approach.

144
00:07:06,938 --> 00:07:10,960
Another one was to, there's a strange mixture to me

145
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,961
in looking back at Civ I of humor,

146
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:15,401
and incredible seriousness.

147
00:07:15,441 --> 00:07:17,962
Like some parts of it, you know,

148
00:07:18,042 --> 00:07:21,363
here's the lions defeat gladiators, seven to nothing.

149
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:25,264
You know, that was our attempt at humor.

150
00:07:26,264 --> 00:07:29,065
Our little friend Elvis here in our city screen.

151
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:30,605
So there are ways that we wanted to make

152
00:07:30,845 --> 00:07:33,386
the history of civilization kind of non-intimidating

153
00:07:34,026 --> 00:07:34,886
and friendly.

154
00:07:36,567 --> 00:07:39,148
But then again, there's the Civilopedia,

155
00:07:39,188 --> 00:07:40,589
where we have an entry here, you know,

156
00:07:40,989 --> 00:07:45,592
trying to make this game feel deep and important

157
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:48,594
and something that you should have your kids

158
00:07:48,654 --> 00:07:49,694
and your parents play.

159
00:07:50,295 --> 00:07:55,098
And so we were really trying to figure this out

160
00:07:55,138 --> 00:07:56,779
as we went along, and there were no...

161
00:07:57,579 --> 00:08:04,484
civilization games before us to guide us as to what we should do. So we kind of dipped our toe in a lot of different areas.

162
00:08:06,126 --> 00:08:13,771
But the bottom line to me, I think, and Bruce, maybe you have a thought about this, is that the game was fun to play when we started.

163
00:08:14,092 --> 00:08:20,857
And as long as that was true, I think we felt we were on the right track, whether our jokes were lame or not.

164
00:08:21,878 --> 00:08:24,720
The game was fun, and I think that kind of what kept us going at the end.

165
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,261
I think we learned the idea that,

166
00:08:26,281 --> 00:08:27,722
I come up with this term called

167
00:08:27,742 --> 00:08:29,403
the inverted pyramid of decision making,

168
00:08:29,443 --> 00:08:31,605
where the game starts with one little

169
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:32,606
settler unit on the board,

170
00:08:32,626 --> 00:08:33,586
and you have a decision,

171
00:08:33,626 --> 00:08:35,768
what direction that person, that unit moves.

172
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:38,210
And quickly you've got cities and more units,

173
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:40,251
and the number of decisions you have,

174
00:08:40,652 --> 00:08:42,013
your choices go up like this.

175
00:08:42,493 --> 00:08:44,194
I called it the inverted pyramid of decision making.

176
00:08:44,554 --> 00:08:46,095
Now years later, I came up with the idea

177
00:08:46,115 --> 00:08:48,157
that you had 15 minutes at that time

178
00:08:48,577 --> 00:08:49,958
to engage someone in your game,

179
00:08:50,078 --> 00:08:51,779
otherwise you might lose them and they'd be gone.

180
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,001
I think today we'd face a situation

181
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:55,182
where you have two or three minutes

182
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:56,983
to get somebody interested in a game today,

183
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:59,605
but then we had more time, and I thought we did.

184
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,206
I think we borrowed from other guys,

185
00:09:01,226 --> 00:09:03,528
or like Empire Deluxe,

186
00:09:03,548 --> 00:09:05,349
you started with just something simpler and it grew.

187
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:07,751
We captured that same sense, I think,

188
00:09:07,771 --> 00:09:09,452
and I think that was a good, we did that well.

189
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:10,553
Or you did that well, let's say.

190
00:09:11,033 --> 00:09:14,675
Yeah, I think our gift was to know what to steal from other games.

191
00:09:15,496 --> 00:09:18,198
Yeah, how much to borrow and how much to invent yourself.

192
00:09:19,579 --> 00:09:19,719
So

193
00:09:23,517 --> 00:09:25,339
Was this a good, did we do this right or wrong?

194
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:26,981
I think the jury is still out.

195
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:31,146
When you look at how the Civilization series has evolved,

196
00:09:32,307 --> 00:09:34,910
humor has not necessarily been a big part

197
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,211
of the succeeding Civ games,

198
00:09:36,792 --> 00:09:38,854
but it was really an indication

199
00:09:38,934 --> 00:09:41,236
of kind of how unsure we were about.

200
00:09:43,378 --> 00:09:47,040
Was this game going to be taken seriously by players,

201
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,262
or was it something we needed to really kind of lighten up

202
00:09:50,322 --> 00:09:51,783
and make more accessible in that way?

203
00:09:51,803 --> 00:09:53,664
I think we found a good balance. I mean, I felt good about it.

204
00:09:53,684 --> 00:09:57,006
One little point I made a note of is that I think we did a good job

205
00:09:57,086 --> 00:10:00,548
of telling the players that he or she was doing a good job.

206
00:10:00,948 --> 00:10:04,050
We loved the King Day parades, and there was other notices,

207
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,311
the newspaper reports, and...

208
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:07,577
That was all the ways that we were telling the player,

209
00:10:07,597 --> 00:10:09,843
you're doing great, keep going, you're super,

210
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,648
you're doing a great job as king of this country.

211
00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:14,135
I think we did that well.

212
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:16,800
I think that's always a question in games as you're playing,

213
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,001
am I doing the right thing?

214
00:10:18,061 --> 00:10:18,901
Am I on the right track?

215
00:10:19,402 --> 00:10:22,104
Have I spent the last hour or two wasting my time?

216
00:10:22,704 --> 00:10:25,206
Giving the player those constant indications

217
00:10:25,246 --> 00:10:29,029
that this is progress, this is the right thing to do,

218
00:10:29,149 --> 00:10:32,371
or we're watching, we're appreciating what you're doing,

219
00:10:32,451 --> 00:10:36,174
is encouraging to the player to allow them to keep going.

220
00:10:38,343 --> 00:10:41,445
One thing that I guess in hindsight seems so obvious,

221
00:10:41,545 --> 00:10:45,368
but we really could not call this game Civilization

222
00:10:45,508 --> 00:10:46,829
as it was in development.

223
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:48,551
That was kind of our code name,

224
00:10:48,591 --> 00:10:49,651
that was our internal name,

225
00:10:49,671 --> 00:10:52,073
but our assumption was that this game

226
00:10:52,093 --> 00:10:53,294
would not be called Civilization

227
00:10:53,334 --> 00:10:54,815
because there was a board game out there

228
00:10:55,376 --> 00:10:57,417
called Civilization, it was owned by Avalon Hill,

229
00:10:57,457 --> 00:10:58,938
which was another computer game

230
00:10:59,239 --> 00:11:00,539
publishing company at the time.

231
00:11:01,222 --> 00:11:05,245
And the game had originally been designed in England.

232
00:11:05,946 --> 00:11:09,869
So we were trying to come up with alternative names.

233
00:11:09,989 --> 00:11:12,691
And I don't remember.

234
00:11:12,711 --> 00:11:17,294
Call to Power, Rise of Nations, Age of Empires,

235
00:11:17,334 --> 00:11:18,555
you know, names like that.

236
00:11:18,635 --> 00:11:25,381
But we said, you know, the only appropriate name

237
00:11:25,421 --> 00:11:26,922
for this game is Civilization.

238
00:11:27,022 --> 00:11:29,824
So our intrepid.

239
00:11:30,549 --> 00:11:37,232
marketing team went to talk to Avalon Hill, and amazingly enough, they were able to work

240
00:11:37,292 --> 00:11:41,715
out an arrangement there. I think Avalon Hill was maybe withdrawing somewhat from the computer

241
00:11:41,975 --> 00:11:48,438
side of things at the time, and we were able to get the name to Civilization, which I think

242
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:55,421
is actually a pretty significant part of the success of the game. When you look back at

243
00:11:55,461 --> 00:11:56,282
the games that we've done...

244
00:11:57,262 --> 00:12:00,943
Pirates, exclamation point, railroad tycoon.

245
00:12:01,183 --> 00:12:05,164
I mean, it's those names that kind of create a picture

246
00:12:05,184 --> 00:12:07,365
in your mind almost immediately of what the game might be

247
00:12:07,845 --> 00:12:09,585
that helped them to be successful.

248
00:12:10,506 --> 00:12:12,686
And I also actually credit this image

249
00:12:12,846 --> 00:12:15,227
that one of our marketing people was able to find.

250
00:12:16,327 --> 00:12:17,848
This was not created for the game.

251
00:12:17,868 --> 00:12:19,789
It was actually found.

252
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:24,873
But it captures, again, the potential, the possibilities

253
00:12:24,933 --> 00:12:28,014
of what your game experience is going to be.

254
00:12:30,096 --> 00:12:33,157
The other point that I'll make is that our game did not really

255
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:36,131
duplicate the board game?

256
00:12:36,431 --> 00:12:38,332
I get that question fairly often.

257
00:12:38,832 --> 00:12:43,133
The board game was limited to a specific geographic area and a

258
00:12:43,193 --> 00:12:46,014
specific era of time.

259
00:12:46,955 --> 00:12:49,495
There were some cool ideas in there, but I think we added a

260
00:12:50,396 --> 00:12:52,296
few of our own as we went along.

261
00:12:53,997 --> 00:12:56,938
But this, I think, was a huge win for us to be able to use

262
00:12:56,998 --> 00:13:00,279
the name Civilization for the game that we were making.

263
00:13:05,513 --> 00:13:07,875
Okay, here we go.

264
00:13:10,517 --> 00:13:13,899
This is the, kind of the classic.

265
00:13:14,918 --> 00:13:21,381
perception of Civ is that it is the turn-based game. The

266
00:13:21,441 --> 00:13:26,564
turn-based-ishness is at the heart of Civilization. And

267
00:13:27,524 --> 00:13:32,347
interestingly enough, the first version of the game, probably

268
00:13:32,367 --> 00:13:37,509
the one that Bruce has the disc of, was not turn-based. It was

269
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:39,110
more of a SimCity

270
00:13:40,797 --> 00:13:43,820
zone this area for farms, zone this area for,

271
00:13:44,421 --> 00:13:47,144
kind of watch things evolve over time.

272
00:13:48,225 --> 00:13:51,749
And it was really when we switched over

273
00:13:51,809 --> 00:13:55,152
to a turn-based mode that the game came together.

274
00:13:57,096 --> 00:14:02,619
At that point, the player became totally engaged in what was happening, but was given enough

275
00:14:02,699 --> 00:14:06,161
time to really consider the implications of what they were doing.

276
00:14:07,422 --> 00:14:10,163
They had, could project into the future.

277
00:14:10,804 --> 00:14:15,326
What I like to think about Civilization is it's a game where you are always, your mind

278
00:14:15,386 --> 00:14:16,387
is always ahead of the game.

279
00:14:16,487 --> 00:14:17,627
You're always anticipating.

280
00:14:18,668 --> 00:14:24,977
What's going to happen next you have a couple of things a wonder being built over here. You're exploring this continent over here

281
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:29,123
You've always got a couple things going on that you're looking towards and that

282
00:14:29,323 --> 00:14:34,110
You know that kind of feeds into that one more turn or that one more technology or one more

283
00:14:36,896 --> 00:14:39,157
You're always kind of leaning forward into the future.

284
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:43,359
Very interesting, of course Bruce went on to Ensemble

285
00:14:43,439 --> 00:14:47,621
to create Age of Empires there, which was turn-based,

286
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:49,242
I mean it was real-time.

287
00:14:50,663 --> 00:14:55,405
In my mind, the reason those games are so different

288
00:14:55,585 --> 00:14:59,627
is almost solely based on the fact that one is turn-based

289
00:14:59,747 --> 00:15:01,208
and one is real-time.

290
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:06,811
Bruce, do you have anything to say about that?

291
00:15:06,851 --> 00:15:10,713
Well, Age of Empires was like five or six years later,

292
00:15:10,813 --> 00:15:12,853
and the world had changed a little bit.

293
00:15:12,873 --> 00:15:14,534
The strategy games, you know, there had been Command

294
00:15:14,574 --> 00:15:16,855
and Conquer had been published, and Warcraft had been

295
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,415
published, and these were real-time strategy games,

296
00:15:18,435 --> 00:15:18,715
and they were.

297
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:25,148
Extremely successful and so my my colleagues and I were we wanted we needed to do something different

298
00:15:25,188 --> 00:15:30,671
We but we love civilization, but we want to do something different. We said can we do civilization in real time?

299
00:15:30,772 --> 00:15:33,813
What would that be like? Would that be it'd be different enough?

300
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:36,535
It wouldn't be you know be borrowing but we wouldn't be borrowing everything

301
00:15:37,095 --> 00:15:41,478
It would be different enough to be a new a new product and it turned out it was I mean it was more than just

302
00:15:42,218 --> 00:15:43,259
real time but at real time

303
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,911
Also, our games were played in like an hour.

304
00:15:45,931 --> 00:15:48,032
Age of Empires was an hour, half hour experience,

305
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,193
where Civilization was a different,

306
00:15:49,613 --> 00:15:50,854
longer experience usually.

307
00:15:51,654 --> 00:15:54,336
So we're trying to adjust to the marketplace

308
00:15:54,476 --> 00:15:57,297
and take advantage of things that had changed.

309
00:15:57,317 --> 00:16:00,799
I think it's nice that both games existed

310
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:02,460
and did really well.

311
00:16:03,841 --> 00:16:05,222
And we also did other things too.

312
00:16:05,482 --> 00:16:07,263
We telescoped our time period.

313
00:16:07,643 --> 00:16:09,965
Age one was just Ancients and then age two was.

314
00:16:10,533 --> 00:16:14,395
was the knights and castles, which was the sweet spot,

315
00:16:14,435 --> 00:16:15,095
really turned out.

316
00:16:15,155 --> 00:16:18,016
But yeah, it was certainly influenced.

317
00:16:18,036 --> 00:16:20,578
The vision for Age was let's take civilization,

318
00:16:20,638 --> 00:16:22,959
move it into real-time strategy and historical framework,

319
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:24,379
and that was the vision.

320
00:16:24,987 --> 00:16:31,675
Yeah, it just strikes me that a lot of the differences are based on that, that you can't play a

321
00:16:31,715 --> 00:16:38,582
real-time game for 20 hours. It would be too intense. And by the same token, a turn-based

322
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:44,069
game that lasted 30 minutes or so, again, would not really be satisfying.

323
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:49,652
It's, I think this issue of turn-based versus real-time

324
00:16:50,072 --> 00:16:53,414
has so many implications in terms of where the games go,

325
00:16:53,474 --> 00:16:56,075
again, given the similar subject matter.

326
00:16:56,095 --> 00:17:00,917
So, it was not, we did not realize at the time

327
00:17:00,957 --> 00:17:05,300
that we had made this pretty significant switch

328
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,761
and the whole one more turn phenomenon.

329
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:12,484
had not really occurred to us. It's something that just arose

330
00:17:12,644 --> 00:17:15,886
out of the development of the game. Looking back it seems to

331
00:17:15,926 --> 00:17:22,150
be so characteristic of Civ, but it was a way of just getting you

332
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:24,612
closer to the action and getting you more involved in what was

333
00:17:24,632 --> 00:17:27,974
happening. At the same time giving you enough time to

334
00:17:28,054 --> 00:17:29,095
consider your decisions.

335
00:17:30,056 --> 00:17:37,862
Really allowing us to do things like the tech tree and diplomacy, all the different things that you take some time to do in the game.

336
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:43,567
We're really based on this fact that we switched over to a turn-based mode.

337
00:17:45,488 --> 00:17:50,232
Probably it was fairly uncommon in games of that time, I'd have to say.

338
00:17:50,252 --> 00:18:00,139
A lot of our background was in wargaming, which is clearly turn-based or movement-based or player-time-scale based.

339
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:08,625
And that probably influenced a lot of what we did there, but at the time it was fairly different from what was going on there.

340
00:18:09,906 --> 00:18:10,947
As well as the fact that...

341
00:18:12,117 --> 00:18:15,622
The whole idea of doing a strategy game was kind of unique at that time.

342
00:18:15,682 --> 00:18:19,366
And there were a few games out there, but strategy games were generally considered

343
00:18:20,788 --> 00:18:28,237
slow-moving, boring, nerd-oriented, and setting up a bunch of counters on a map.

344
00:18:29,643 --> 00:18:33,564
And it was not something that computers were supposed to be

345
00:18:34,545 --> 00:18:35,805
fun for computer game players.

346
00:18:36,566 --> 00:18:39,087
And the irony for us was that within a couple years,

347
00:18:39,187 --> 00:18:40,447
everything was a strategy game.

348
00:18:40,467 --> 00:18:41,888
It was a real-time strategy game.

349
00:18:41,948 --> 00:18:43,849
It was a space-based strategy game.

350
00:18:44,529 --> 00:18:46,650
So we claimed to have made the world safe

351
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:51,192
for strategy gaming by making associations.

352
00:18:51,212 --> 00:18:53,073
We had to fight battles inside the company, too.

353
00:18:53,093 --> 00:18:54,854
I mean, the company wasn't too excited about it.

354
00:18:54,874 --> 00:18:56,754
They wanted more flight sims and things like that.

355
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,236
doing a turn-based strategy game was not

356
00:19:00,136 --> 00:19:02,538
enthusiastically embraced by the management of the company.

357
00:19:03,218 --> 00:19:06,040
It was a revolutionary concept at the time.

358
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,741
Until it started to sell and the critical reviews

359
00:19:07,761 --> 00:19:09,042
started coming in, then they were real happy.

360
00:19:09,062 --> 00:19:10,142
They want another one of those, please.

361
00:19:12,123 --> 00:19:12,604
Take two.

362
00:19:13,204 --> 00:19:13,664
Take two of those.

363
00:19:16,639 --> 00:19:19,121
Great leaders.

364
00:19:21,963 --> 00:19:24,185
Another thing that amazed and surprised us

365
00:19:24,325 --> 00:19:28,809
was the Gandhi phenomenon, the Gandhi meme,

366
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:31,371
making the world safe for Gandhi.

367
00:19:33,812 --> 00:19:39,417
This is a phenomenon steeped in mystery and legend.

368
00:19:39,537 --> 00:19:42,379
But our theory is that.

369
00:19:44,193 --> 00:19:51,496
Gandhi was not really programmed to be more of a warmonger than anybody else, but it was so out of

370
00:19:51,576 --> 00:19:57,498
character for him and kind of really illustrated that the game is not about reproducing history,

371
00:19:57,598 --> 00:20:05,320
but creating your own historical story. So whenever Gandhi came up with a bad attitude,

372
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,741
it was something that people really noticed and remarked upon.

373
00:20:10,482 --> 00:20:15,425
But the idea of meeting the great leaders I think kind of goes along with one of the

374
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:17,426
fundamental things that we wanted to do with Civ.

375
00:20:18,087 --> 00:20:22,370
And Bruce and I have talked about this, that we did our research in the children's section

376
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:27,153
of the library, that we were not trying to create a game that was about all the obscure

377
00:20:27,213 --> 00:20:30,695
historical facts that we happen to know because we read the right book.

378
00:20:31,176 --> 00:20:33,857
It was about things that everybody would be familiar with.

379
00:20:34,638 --> 00:20:39,122
And that allowed players to feel at home,

380
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:43,325
to feel comfortable, to feel smart about the concepts

381
00:20:43,365 --> 00:20:46,007
that were in the game because they were familiar with them

382
00:20:46,047 --> 00:20:46,828
or had heard about them.

383
00:20:47,929 --> 00:20:49,750
And also they were kind of interacting

384
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:52,432
on a peer-to-peer level with great figures like.

385
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:56,394
Genghis Khan or Caesar or great leaders.

386
00:20:56,454 --> 00:20:59,015
So this was the role we wanted to put you in.

387
00:20:59,035 --> 00:21:02,597
This idea of building a civilization

388
00:21:02,637 --> 00:21:04,858
and being a great leader and being able to interact

389
00:21:04,898 --> 00:21:07,379
with these other leaders, I think really strengthened

390
00:21:08,439 --> 00:21:10,600
that role-playing aspect of the game.

391
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:16,082
I was gonna say something, I can't remember what it was.

392
00:21:16,102 --> 00:21:16,462
Sorry.

393
00:21:17,468 --> 00:21:21,111
So the kind of the byline that we used,

394
00:21:21,371 --> 00:21:23,413
it's good to be king, I think that might be

395
00:21:23,433 --> 00:21:24,374
by Mel Brooks, but.

396
00:21:24,414 --> 00:21:25,956
It was interesting, because the idea was that

397
00:21:26,016 --> 00:21:27,637
I'm a god in this game, I'm a player,

398
00:21:27,657 --> 00:21:29,479
and I'm running the whole show here,

399
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:32,021
but then you add this layer in where you put

400
00:21:32,061 --> 00:21:34,604
these leaders in, and so he gave you a dual personality,

401
00:21:34,644 --> 00:21:37,887
like I am now Stalin, or I am now Genghis Khan.

402
00:21:38,727 --> 00:21:40,889
I didn't give it that much thought,

403
00:21:40,909 --> 00:21:42,591
but you put it in there, and I think it worked.

404
00:21:44,027 --> 00:21:51,232
Yeah, I think there's always a question in a game of what do you ask the player to do and what does the computer kind of do automatically.

405
00:21:51,793 --> 00:22:02,340
And by keeping this idea in mind that you're the great leader, that really clarified a lot of the decisions in terms of what the player would do and what would kind of be done automatically.

406
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:07,243
I also want to say, I think that we borrowed from, let's say, the children's section of the library.

407
00:22:07,724 --> 00:22:09,204
But I think there was two things about that.

408
00:22:09,384 --> 00:22:11,625
One is that they have lots of pictures in those books.

409
00:22:12,185 --> 00:22:13,286
And when you're dealing with artists,

410
00:22:13,326 --> 00:22:15,427
you need to have images that they can work with

411
00:22:15,447 --> 00:22:16,287
to make the product.

412
00:22:16,307 --> 00:22:17,448
Now you were making most of the art,

413
00:22:17,508 --> 00:22:20,809
but this is a small team a long time ago.

414
00:22:20,849 --> 00:22:22,910
And Sid did the programming, the design, and the artwork.

415
00:22:25,611 --> 00:22:27,292
So the pictures were helpful going forward

416
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:28,632
in the years ahead when you had to come up

417
00:22:28,652 --> 00:22:29,453
with the images to tell people.

418
00:22:29,513 --> 00:22:31,293
And the other thing was that, what was the other thing?

419
00:22:32,174 --> 00:22:32,974
It's already gone again.

420
00:22:33,534 --> 00:22:35,755
Well, Bruce, I'm glad you mentioned our team

421
00:22:35,795 --> 00:22:36,176
because...

422
00:22:38,549 --> 00:22:45,051
get the small violin out. There were only about 10 of us on the team at the end and just the two

423
00:22:45,091 --> 00:22:54,593
of us, Bruce and I, worked on the project for most of the time. We had 640K in our IBM PC. We

424
00:22:54,633 --> 00:22:58,074
had 16 colors in our EGA palette that we could not change.

425
00:22:59,134 --> 00:23:02,736
And eventually we got VGA with 256 glorious colors.

426
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:06,758
It was a very different time, obviously, technically.

427
00:23:07,358 --> 00:23:08,559
But I think what it allowed us to do

428
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:11,180
was focus most of our energy on the game design.

429
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:14,642
And players were willing to use their imagination

430
00:23:14,702 --> 00:23:16,082
to add a lot of the elements that we

431
00:23:16,122 --> 00:23:17,123
couldn't create at the time.

432
00:23:17,183 --> 00:23:19,364
And that actually was a pretty good trade-off, I think,

433
00:23:19,404 --> 00:23:19,684
for us.

434
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:22,866
As we mentioned, we started the game in early 1990.

435
00:23:25,391 --> 00:23:27,333
actually stopped working on it,

436
00:23:28,013 --> 00:23:29,834
finished another game called Cover Action,

437
00:23:30,494 --> 00:23:31,795
and came back to this game,

438
00:23:32,876 --> 00:23:34,917
and eventually shipped it in late 1991.

439
00:23:35,177 --> 00:23:38,159
Probably was early 91, yeah.

440
00:23:38,339 --> 00:23:39,920
Sometime in 91 it was early, I think.

441
00:23:40,841 --> 00:23:43,803
So overall, I think we spent less than a year

442
00:23:43,823 --> 00:23:46,825
in developing the original version of the game.

443
00:23:49,758 --> 00:23:52,560
One thing about the artwork is that as the time goes by,

444
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,902
I come from the school, I mean the first

445
00:23:55,623 --> 00:23:57,504
personal computer game I worked on had four colors,

446
00:23:57,584 --> 00:24:00,666
CGA graphics, and so I always came up with the school

447
00:24:00,686 --> 00:24:02,408
that the game has gotta be really interesting

448
00:24:02,428 --> 00:24:03,889
and fun to play, because you're not gonna

449
00:24:03,929 --> 00:24:05,170
wow anybody with how it looks.

450
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:08,652
And then, you know, with the 256 colors in us,

451
00:24:08,712 --> 00:24:09,993
and we could do really interesting things,

452
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:12,055
but I'm still pushing back about,

453
00:24:12,095 --> 00:24:13,196
let's don't put a lot of money in art,

454
00:24:13,336 --> 00:24:14,036
art's not important.

455
00:24:14,437 --> 00:24:15,838
And then, you know, I had partners by then,

456
00:24:15,858 --> 00:24:16,939
and they said, no, no, no, we're gonna make

457
00:24:16,959 --> 00:24:18,079
this incredibly beautiful.

458
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,821
I said, well, okay, go ahead.

459
00:24:19,841 --> 00:24:21,562
And it made a big difference when Age of Empires

460
00:24:21,623 --> 00:24:22,944
was really, really nice looking.

461
00:24:23,484 --> 00:24:25,046
The sun was always shining, it was pretty,

462
00:24:25,066 --> 00:24:26,587
it was outdoors, it was nice.

463
00:24:26,887 --> 00:24:27,588
I think it made a difference,

464
00:24:27,628 --> 00:24:28,829
and I was not prepared for that,

465
00:24:28,849 --> 00:24:31,631
because I come from the stone ages of game design,

466
00:24:31,671 --> 00:24:32,892
when we didn't care about colors,

467
00:24:32,912 --> 00:24:33,913
there were no colors to work with.

468
00:24:35,942 --> 00:24:37,823
Speaking of the time we took to make the game, Bruce,

469
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:39,424
I think you have a fascinating anecdote

470
00:24:39,484 --> 00:24:42,306
about the cost involved in making these games.

471
00:24:42,626 --> 00:24:45,608
Oh, well, I don't remember civilization per se,

472
00:24:45,628 --> 00:24:48,649
but I was asked to do a budget analysis for Railroad Tycoon.

473
00:24:48,669 --> 00:24:49,450
When we got done with it,

474
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:50,830
one of the management guys asked me to do it.

475
00:24:51,251 --> 00:24:52,671
So I calculated the people who worked on it,

476
00:24:53,012 --> 00:24:55,073
what they got paid, essentially, and the time.

477
00:24:55,633 --> 00:24:57,114
And it came out that Railroad Tycoon

478
00:24:57,134 --> 00:24:58,094
had cost the company $167,000 to make.

479
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:03,280
And this was in 1989 or 1990 or something like that.

480
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,461
I was like, wow.

481
00:25:04,561 --> 00:25:07,064
I mean, we can't hire a great programmer

482
00:25:07,084 --> 00:25:08,586
for that kind of money, it seems like today.

483
00:25:08,906 --> 00:25:09,427
For one year.

484
00:25:09,447 --> 00:25:12,510
And Civ was similar, I think.

485
00:25:12,931 --> 00:25:13,071
Yeah.

486
00:25:15,234 --> 00:25:20,576
So, here's one of the great controversies of civilization.

487
00:25:20,696 --> 00:25:22,938
Perhaps one of the things we didn't do quite as well

488
00:25:22,998 --> 00:25:24,018
as we could have done.

489
00:25:24,038 --> 00:25:26,539
I don't know if you were around in the Civ I days,

490
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,841
you were probably deeply involved on one side

491
00:25:29,881 --> 00:25:31,802
or the other of this controversy.

492
00:25:33,163 --> 00:25:34,384
Just to refresh your memory,

493
00:25:35,304 --> 00:25:38,466
the question was, can a spearman defeat a battleship?

494
00:25:40,155 --> 00:25:45,117
Some people believed it could, some people believed it could not. In the game it could,

495
00:25:45,817 --> 00:25:52,080
not all the time, but the Gandhi phenomenon where something weird happens once, you assume

496
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:59,243
it's a standard part of the game, this became one of the early controversies of the game,

497
00:25:59,263 --> 00:26:04,985
whether it was okay for a spearman to once in a while defeat a battleship.

498
00:26:07,825 --> 00:26:13,371
My claim was mathematically speaking, the spearman had a defense of two and the battleship had an

499
00:26:13,411 --> 00:26:20,497
attack of 16. So, you know, it could happen. The math could work out in that fashion. Other

500
00:26:20,517 --> 00:26:27,664
people with kind of visual, who looked at the world visually and saw a battleship and a spearman

501
00:26:27,704 --> 00:26:28,785
were not convinced.

502
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:34,241
And interestingly enough, combat,

503
00:26:34,641 --> 00:26:36,723
if we look back at the history of Civilization

504
00:26:36,843 --> 00:26:38,664
and the various iterations of the game,

505
00:26:39,065 --> 00:26:41,626
is probably the one area that has changed the most.

506
00:26:41,687 --> 00:26:44,308
That we are, we're kind of constantly looking at

507
00:26:44,489 --> 00:26:48,151
a new way to handle combat.

508
00:26:48,251 --> 00:26:51,354
Because there's a tension between

509
00:26:52,369 --> 00:26:56,892
the view that we give you of the world as the great leader,

510
00:26:56,952 --> 00:27:00,373
that you're planning cities and you're exploring continents

511
00:27:00,834 --> 00:27:02,535
and you're deciding which wonders to build.

512
00:27:02,555 --> 00:27:04,676
And on the other hand, we're kind of getting you down

513
00:27:05,236 --> 00:27:06,977
into the nitty gritty of the combat system.

514
00:27:06,997 --> 00:27:08,878
You're moving your units, you're stacking them,

515
00:27:08,898 --> 00:27:11,839
you're deciding where to, so there's kind of a tension

516
00:27:11,879 --> 00:27:14,401
between the role that you play as the king

517
00:27:14,501 --> 00:27:17,162
over most of your civilization and your,

518
00:27:18,522 --> 00:27:21,764
your role as far as combat is concerned. So at various times

519
00:27:21,784 --> 00:27:24,645
we've actually considered going to a separate map to resolve

520
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:28,787
combat because combat can be significant in the outcome of

521
00:27:28,807 --> 00:27:33,610
the game. We've kind of dealt with the spearman versus

522
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:36,751
battleship controversy by adding hit points in multiple rounds of

523
00:27:36,811 --> 00:27:40,153
combat and things like that to make it somewhat less likely

524
00:27:40,613 --> 00:27:42,494
that the spearman will defeat the battleship.

525
00:27:43,735 --> 00:27:45,417
With more recent iterations of Civ,

526
00:27:45,457 --> 00:27:47,880
there's one unit per tile,

527
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,603
there's different stacking rules and things like that.

528
00:27:52,185 --> 00:27:55,709
The original Civ game had a concept called zones of control

529
00:27:55,789 --> 00:27:58,612
which came from Wargaming,

530
00:27:58,693 --> 00:28:01,716
which was probably the worst idea that we put in the game.

531
00:28:02,437 --> 00:28:03,638
But it reflected...

532
00:28:04,981 --> 00:28:10,429
my vision kind of how combat was going to work in this game. I was imagining you'd create lines of

533
00:28:10,549 --> 00:28:17,099
units at your borders and you'd be trying to hold the other civs back and it would be a very kind

534
00:28:17,139 --> 00:28:21,325
of look like a World War II type of strategy game.

535
00:28:22,166 --> 00:28:24,867
That turned out to be not at all how the game was played.

536
00:28:25,147 --> 00:28:29,790
The stacks of doom was kind of the typical mechanism,

537
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:33,051
putting together a bunch of units and moving them around.

538
00:28:33,632 --> 00:28:37,133
And the cities became really very much the focus

539
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:39,815
of where combat took place, which actually worked well

540
00:28:39,915 --> 00:28:43,737
because it was a lot easier, smoother,

541
00:28:44,277 --> 00:28:48,339
and allowed you to focus energy on other parts of the game

542
00:28:48,379 --> 00:28:49,760
as well as just the combat.

543
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:55,123
But something we had no, that I certainly had no idea of it,

544
00:28:55,164 --> 00:28:57,025
that when we first put things together,

545
00:28:57,725 --> 00:28:59,186
the rules that I were creating for combat

546
00:28:59,226 --> 00:29:01,768
were focused around this more kind of spread out,

547
00:29:01,928 --> 00:29:03,629
war game-y type of combat.

548
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:08,012
But certainly with Civ 1 and then with the succeeding Civs,

549
00:29:08,052 --> 00:29:10,313
we kind of understood what was happening.

550
00:29:10,354 --> 00:29:11,694
And some of the changes that have been made

551
00:29:11,734 --> 00:29:13,696
in the more recent Civs are almost actually trying

552
00:29:13,716 --> 00:29:15,697
to get back to that more spread out combat

553
00:29:15,737 --> 00:29:18,219
and less about the stacks of doom.

554
00:29:20,899 --> 00:29:28,021
One of the other things we did with Civ was we tried to make very clear what the considerations

555
00:29:28,041 --> 00:29:29,361
were that went into combat.

556
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:34,002
We gave each unit an attack factor, a defense factor, and a movement factor, and those were

557
00:29:34,302 --> 00:29:36,023
printed right on the unit, right in your face.

558
00:29:36,743 --> 00:29:41,545
And so that with all the systems in the game, we tried to make it very clear how they worked.

559
00:29:41,965 --> 00:29:45,509
So you weren't spending your mental energy trying to decipher the systems.

560
00:29:45,569 --> 00:29:49,974
You were spending your mental energy imagining how you would use those systems that you understood,

561
00:29:50,895 --> 00:29:55,981
how they interacted and how you would use them to accomplish your purposes in the game.

562
00:29:56,502 --> 00:29:58,965
But with combat...

563
00:29:59,565 --> 00:30:06,887
It was definitely a work in progress and I think we're still constantly adjusting how it works

564
00:30:08,567 --> 00:30:13,469
and relates to the other parts of the game because there's that tension between how important it is

565
00:30:13,549 --> 00:30:21,290
and what role you have. But I'll admit that I may have dropped the ball here as far as combat is

566
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:21,771
concerned.

567
00:30:24,462 --> 00:30:28,966
Hey, I made peace with it. I mean, I think I probably raised the issue that I was the first guy to ever deal with it

568
00:30:29,026 --> 00:30:30,667
So I probably raised it first. I mean, how is this?

569
00:30:31,388 --> 00:30:34,410
Crummy ancient unit defeating this modern warship. It doesn't make any sense to me

570
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:37,733
You know, this ship is on the coast and here's this guy in the land. I attack him

571
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:40,996
I should have just blown this guy to smithereens. No. No, I lost my battleship. I don't get it

572
00:30:41,837 --> 00:30:46,501
So this is the kind of conversation we have and he'd say well, he explained it to me and I said, okay

573
00:30:47,415 --> 00:30:48,055
Okay, it's fine.

574
00:30:48,135 --> 00:30:48,995
I'll live with that.

575
00:30:49,555 --> 00:30:51,116
And I can think, I can play chess,

576
00:30:51,276 --> 00:30:54,017
and the pawn can kill the queen on the right circumstance.

577
00:30:54,517 --> 00:30:56,698
I mean, so, I mean, it's a game.

578
00:30:56,758 --> 00:30:59,699
It's not, we're not trying to model reality here.

579
00:30:59,719 --> 00:31:03,740
It's a game, and so I made that decision myself,

580
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,441
and then I had to explain it to the next 50 guys

581
00:31:05,461 --> 00:31:07,141
that marched into my room complaining,

582
00:31:07,161 --> 00:31:07,862
because this is stupid.

583
00:31:07,882 --> 00:31:08,962
So it's your fault.

584
00:31:09,022 --> 00:31:10,502
You did not convince me to change.

585
00:31:10,542 --> 00:31:11,843
One of my jobs was to shield you

586
00:31:11,883 --> 00:31:12,903
from everybody else in the company

587
00:31:12,923 --> 00:31:14,044
who was upset about something.

588
00:31:14,084 --> 00:31:16,084
So they'd march down to my office and say,

589
00:31:16,104 --> 00:31:16,945
what is going on with this?

590
00:31:17,645 --> 00:31:21,112
And I'm going you know, I have to explain it again. I should have put a board on my door

591
00:31:21,152 --> 00:31:25,240
This is the problem with spearmen with the battleships. You know, don't bother me about it. This is the answer right here

592
00:31:28,526 --> 00:31:29,127
Thank You Bruce

593
00:31:30,986 --> 00:31:35,228
So another thing that we introduced with Civ 1 was the

594
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:40,750
idea of the tech tree. And again, in hindsight, this seems

595
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:46,573
so classic, so characteristic of the Civ game. And I wish I

596
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:49,934
remembered the moment when we said, hey, a tech tree would be

597
00:31:49,994 --> 00:31:52,695
cool. Wouldn't that be cool? Wouldn't that be an idea that

598
00:31:52,795 --> 00:31:56,437
could last for 25 years and not only in our games but in many

599
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:59,078
other games? I don't remember that moment.

600
00:31:59,477 --> 00:32:07,273
But I do remember having a book where kind of the timeline of history was kind of laid

601
00:32:07,413 --> 00:32:09,798
out horizontally and all these different...

602
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:15,092
unique events were kind of pegged to their specific eras and times.

603
00:32:15,232 --> 00:32:20,155
And I'm going to guess that that was kind of the genesis of this idea,

604
00:32:20,175 --> 00:32:22,517
that one thing would lead to another.

605
00:32:22,797 --> 00:32:27,600
And it fell so wonderfully into our idea of starting very small

606
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:32,702
and then gradually kind of unpeeling the onion

607
00:32:32,923 --> 00:32:35,244
and giving you more and more interesting things to do.

608
00:32:36,084 --> 00:32:37,885
And I think it also kind of...

609
00:32:40,068 --> 00:32:42,690
felt very Civish, this idea of,

610
00:32:44,311 --> 00:32:45,873
where on the one hand we had a war game,

611
00:32:45,893 --> 00:32:48,715
we also had a game where science was important.

612
00:32:49,235 --> 00:32:51,597
It was kind of a fairly new idea at the time,

613
00:32:51,998 --> 00:32:55,500
but really, science was gonna be an important part

614
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,223
of this game, and how well you did,

615
00:32:58,243 --> 00:32:59,924
how well you managed it was gonna be significant

616
00:32:59,964 --> 00:33:01,765
in terms of your outcomes.

617
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:06,910
So, the tech tree seemed to kind of encapsulate

618
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:09,211
what we were trying to do with the Civ game.

619
00:33:09,572 --> 00:33:10,272
I love the tech tree.

620
00:33:10,312 --> 00:33:11,894
I was like, how do I get the railroads?

621
00:33:11,934 --> 00:33:13,475
I mean, what do I gotta do to get the railroads?

622
00:33:13,495 --> 00:33:15,156
Because the railroads, I can move my units

623
00:33:15,256 --> 00:33:16,998
all over my empire with one click.

624
00:33:17,258 --> 00:33:18,039
They can go anywhere.

625
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:19,980
I was like, what a great thing this is.

626
00:33:20,501 --> 00:33:22,322
It was cool, it was fun to come up with the names

627
00:33:22,362 --> 00:33:24,004
for civil, it was part of our research.

628
00:33:24,724 --> 00:33:25,805
Again, maybe the children's section,

629
00:33:25,845 --> 00:33:27,386
but what were the important technologies

630
00:33:27,426 --> 00:33:28,607
in thinking about, like the stirrup?

631
00:33:28,647 --> 00:33:29,808
I remember thinking about the stirrup.

632
00:33:30,496 --> 00:33:37,017
because I'd read histories of warfare and the horsemen in battle had been like a side

633
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:40,778
show for most of ancient times until they had a stirrup.

634
00:33:40,818 --> 00:33:44,839
And now the entire power of the horse can be pointed right at the end of your lance.

635
00:33:44,859 --> 00:33:45,739
It's catching your arm.

636
00:33:45,779 --> 00:33:49,620
Now the horse is hitting somebody, not just you with your stupid little spear.

637
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,621
And it changed warfare for a couple hundred years.

638
00:33:51,641 --> 00:33:53,341
I don't think the stirrup is in our text.

639
00:33:53,441 --> 00:33:54,541
Come on, it's got to be in there.

640
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:56,608
I don't know, it should have been.

641
00:33:56,628 --> 00:33:57,549
It's not in our game.

642
00:33:57,569 --> 00:33:58,630
I swear it's in our game.

643
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:00,952
Maybe it was the Age of Empires then, I don't know.

644
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:03,755
But I, it's the same line of thinking.

645
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:05,397
It's the same thinking that here's something

646
00:34:05,437 --> 00:34:07,719
to change the world, at least temporarily.

647
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,642
Let's move on, let's move on.

648
00:34:11,062 --> 00:34:11,803
Wait, I'm looking for.

649
00:34:14,238 --> 00:34:17,181
So one of the things that's fun,

650
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:18,202
stirrup was very important.

651
00:34:18,703 --> 00:34:22,367
One of the things that's fun is to kind of look back

652
00:34:22,687 --> 00:34:26,010
and contrast how we saw things back in that time

653
00:34:26,111 --> 00:34:28,933
and how things have evolved over the course

654
00:34:28,974 --> 00:34:30,135
of many Civ games.

655
00:34:30,915 --> 00:34:34,157
And Bruce mentioned the railroads and the,

656
00:34:34,738 --> 00:34:36,919
what we certainly discovered over time

657
00:34:36,959 --> 00:34:40,701
that people would min-max and analyze the tech tree

658
00:34:41,301 --> 00:34:43,182
and have these specific technologies

659
00:34:43,202 --> 00:34:44,563
that they were targeting.

660
00:34:44,663 --> 00:34:48,345
And they would have track back seven iterations

661
00:34:48,505 --> 00:34:51,407
as to what technologies they would need to research

662
00:34:51,427 --> 00:34:53,768
to get to, gunpowder I think was often a favorite.

663
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:59,337
and that was very contrary to how I saw the tech tree

664
00:34:59,377 --> 00:35:01,260
initially, in fact, in Civ 1,

665
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,343
You might have earned the prerequisites for gunpowder,

666
00:35:06,383 --> 00:35:08,945
let's say, but there was a small chance

667
00:35:08,965 --> 00:35:12,168
that it wouldn't show up in your list of choices

668
00:35:12,288 --> 00:35:15,291
because my thinking was, well, they didn't know

669
00:35:15,371 --> 00:35:18,754
that they were gonna be able to invent gunpowder

670
00:35:18,774 --> 00:35:19,295
at this time.

671
00:35:19,795 --> 00:35:21,917
It was like they were finding their way

672
00:35:21,957 --> 00:35:26,701
through this mysterious cloud of science possibilities

673
00:35:26,902 --> 00:35:29,284
and boy, did we get some complaints about that.

674
00:35:30,865 --> 00:35:36,847
So it was what we did not anticipate was how intensely

675
00:35:36,867 --> 00:35:38,848
and how seriously and how analytically people

676
00:35:38,888 --> 00:35:40,509
would play this game.

677
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:46,432
And that was definitely something that changed in Civ 2.

678
00:35:46,592 --> 00:35:48,633
And in some of the later Civs, it would actually say,

679
00:35:49,193 --> 00:35:51,775
if you want gunpowder, which is like eight leaves

680
00:35:51,835 --> 00:35:54,016
down the tree, you might want to go this direction.

681
00:35:54,836 --> 00:35:56,917
And I was like, oh, that's so wrong.

682
00:35:56,937 --> 00:36:00,377
So it was just like the first appearance of the optimizer

683
00:36:00,437 --> 00:36:01,158
in playing games?

684
00:36:01,238 --> 00:36:01,938
I mean, I don't know.

685
00:36:01,978 --> 00:36:03,018
The min-max player.

686
00:36:03,098 --> 00:36:05,719
One of the things that we certainly have identified

687
00:36:05,759 --> 00:36:07,479
are lots of different personality styles

688
00:36:07,779 --> 00:36:08,719
in terms of playing Civ.

689
00:36:08,779 --> 00:36:14,001
And kind of the tech tree optimizer is such a person.

690
00:36:14,161 --> 00:36:17,382
And I'm always amazed by StarCraft players

691
00:36:17,422 --> 00:36:21,943
that have, again, that same idea, the very specific actions

692
00:36:21,963 --> 00:36:23,203
that you take to play the game.

693
00:36:23,623 --> 00:36:23,703
And.

694
00:36:24,618 --> 00:36:28,262
That's one way to play, but to me, that kind of takes a lot of the fun out of it.

695
00:36:28,322 --> 00:36:35,029
So I guess I'm more drawn to games that are going to surprise me or give me a different challenge every time.

696
00:36:35,089 --> 00:36:36,610
I think that's a question of taste.

697
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:40,534
I mean, because I like the fact that our maps are randomly generated.

698
00:36:40,554 --> 00:36:42,676
You know, the game was different every time you played.

699
00:36:43,022 --> 00:36:47,367
Now, like the StarCraft minimizer,

700
00:36:47,587 --> 00:36:48,668
he loves the map speed.

701
00:36:48,809 --> 00:36:51,552
A guy told me once, a guy at Blizzard told me once,

702
00:36:51,592 --> 00:36:52,473
he got a letter from a guy.

703
00:36:52,813 --> 00:36:55,236
He said, if you move this item one pixel to the north,

704
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:56,838
I will never lose StarCraft again.

705
00:36:57,694 --> 00:36:59,115
That caused me so much problem.

706
00:36:59,155 --> 00:37:00,877
If you just move it one pixel, I will never lose.

707
00:37:01,237 --> 00:37:02,778
And he had to optimize the game to that extent.

708
00:37:02,838 --> 00:37:04,720
So that's a different style of play.

709
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,682
People who like civilization probably were not that guy.

710
00:37:07,983 --> 00:37:09,604
That's certainly something that's been a part of Civ

711
00:37:09,624 --> 00:37:11,666
all the way through, is the idea of random maps,

712
00:37:12,106 --> 00:37:14,628
scenarios, difficulty levels, many different ways

713
00:37:14,688 --> 00:37:16,009
of allowing you to replay the game

714
00:37:16,049 --> 00:37:18,972
and have a different experience, or a new experience,

715
00:37:19,272 --> 00:37:20,833
or a fresh experience.

716
00:37:21,033 --> 00:37:24,116
Yeah, I mean, going forward, I definitely wanted random maps

717
00:37:24,216 --> 00:37:27,078
in the games that we made going forward.

718
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:39,961
The wonders of the world. History is so rich in stuff for us to steal. This was just cool,

719
00:37:40,161 --> 00:37:44,167
low-hanging fruit that wouldn't it be cool to build these awesome wonders?

720
00:37:46,367 --> 00:37:48,428
in the successive iterations of Civ,

721
00:37:48,468 --> 00:37:50,630
we were able to actually give you wonder movies

722
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:54,872
and kind of give you some pretty dramatic payoffs

723
00:37:54,892 --> 00:37:55,652
for doing these things.

724
00:37:55,753 --> 00:38:00,515
But the idea of something that only one Civ

725
00:38:00,555 --> 00:38:01,536
in the world could build,

726
00:38:01,616 --> 00:38:03,557
and you wanted to race to be the first to do that,

727
00:38:04,497 --> 00:38:07,139
gave you another way of being aware of the other Civs

728
00:38:07,419 --> 00:38:10,321
that were in the world and what else was going on there.

729
00:38:11,001 --> 00:38:14,282
And I think it also gave you this connection

730
00:38:14,322 --> 00:38:15,362
to things that you'd heard about,

731
00:38:15,382 --> 00:38:17,763
whether it was Stonehenge or the pyramids.

732
00:38:17,823 --> 00:38:18,763
I think it was aspirational.

733
00:38:18,783 --> 00:38:20,623
I mean, I'm gonna build a great wall,

734
00:38:20,643 --> 00:38:22,144
a great pyramid of Giza.

735
00:38:22,244 --> 00:38:23,504
That's pretty cool, I get to do that.

736
00:38:23,944 --> 00:38:24,604
I wanna do that.

737
00:38:24,664 --> 00:38:27,005
I thought that was interesting, the way we did that,

738
00:38:27,105 --> 00:38:28,185
the way you did that, let's say.

739
00:38:29,645 --> 00:38:31,046
I think the wonders are very popular.

740
00:38:31,066 --> 00:38:33,426
Another thing we did right.

741
00:38:33,726 --> 00:38:34,406
High five there, Bruce.

742
00:38:35,667 --> 00:38:35,987
All right.

743
00:38:39,788 --> 00:38:39,988
Thank you.

744
00:38:40,008 --> 00:38:40,068
And.

745
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,761
Thank you, you're very kind.

746
00:38:45,042 --> 00:38:47,283
So, something we did horribly wrong.

747
00:38:48,803 --> 00:38:52,525
We missed out on the opportunity for modding in scenarios,

748
00:38:52,625 --> 00:38:57,086
which became such a wonderful and important part

749
00:38:57,166 --> 00:39:00,247
of civilization as it proceeded through the years.

750
00:39:02,309 --> 00:39:06,011
Civ 2 really introduced modding as an option,

751
00:39:06,091 --> 00:39:07,792
as a strength, and something that really

752
00:39:08,232 --> 00:39:09,293
engaged our community.

753
00:39:10,614 --> 00:39:13,696
We just didn't have the vision in those days

754
00:39:13,776 --> 00:39:16,417
to imagine that anyone could design anything

755
00:39:16,457 --> 00:39:17,338
better than we could.

756
00:39:17,398 --> 00:39:20,160
I guess I think that was probably our thinking at the time.

757
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:20,920
Wasn't my thinking.

758
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:21,280
I don't know.

759
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,041
I don't know.

760
00:39:24,162 --> 00:39:30,504
But the idea that this is a really opened up the game to a

761
00:39:30,564 --> 00:39:34,465
whole different kind of player. I'd like to think that a lot of

762
00:39:34,485 --> 00:39:37,806
designers perhaps got their first design experience making a

763
00:39:37,866 --> 00:39:42,188
mod for Civilization or a similar game. Again, what we

764
00:39:42,248 --> 00:39:44,789
found in terms of the feedback that we were receiving for our

765
00:39:44,829 --> 00:39:46,149
game was that

766
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:52,332
A lot of the feedback was suggestions for improvement of the game.

767
00:39:52,352 --> 00:39:56,934
Things that players liked or things that they thought should be changed or fixed.

768
00:39:57,574 --> 00:40:03,957
And Civ seemed to bring out the inner designer in a lot of our players and modding.

769
00:40:05,211 --> 00:40:07,733
gave those people the opportunity to express that.

770
00:40:07,773 --> 00:40:10,396
And I think it was, it's probably the reason Civ

771
00:40:10,416 --> 00:40:11,577
has been around for so long,

772
00:40:11,697 --> 00:40:14,099
is that Modding was introduced in Civ 2,

773
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:18,202
and gave players things to do,

774
00:40:18,302 --> 00:40:21,925
and kind of a freshness between the five or so years

775
00:40:21,945 --> 00:40:24,327
that it took to bring out a new civilization.

776
00:40:24,407 --> 00:40:28,691
So this was an opportunity I think that we missed.

777
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:36,797
Now in those days there was no internet and so we were kind of justified by, probably would have

778
00:40:36,818 --> 00:40:43,540
been pretty complicated. I wouldn't beat yourself up over this one, come on. We had a small team,

779
00:40:43,581 --> 00:40:47,982
we had a limited time to make this game, the management's tromping down the hall, what are you

780
00:40:48,022 --> 00:40:52,985
working on today? Where's my new flight simulator? What is this stupid game? So we were under

781
00:40:53,085 --> 00:40:57,047
pressure, I thought I was under pressure. You weren't, you were never under pressure.

782
00:40:59,433 --> 00:41:01,716
We had to get this game, you know, you did a great job of

783
00:41:02,677 --> 00:41:03,638
putting it in a box and saying,

784
00:41:03,678 --> 00:41:04,980
this is what's going out the door.

785
00:41:05,501 --> 00:41:06,522
And like, you know,

786
00:41:06,562 --> 00:41:08,585
cause after you let everybody else in the company play it,

787
00:41:08,605 --> 00:41:10,327
it was a lot of ideas were coming in your office.

788
00:41:10,347 --> 00:41:11,789
And I think you did a great job of saying.

789
00:41:12,911 --> 00:41:14,892
I had this idea that when you're designing a game,

790
00:41:14,912 --> 00:41:16,393
your first half of the project,

791
00:41:16,433 --> 00:41:18,134
you're playing forward on the soccer team,

792
00:41:18,154 --> 00:41:19,295
and you're trying to score goals.

793
00:41:19,715 --> 00:41:21,517
Idea, idea, idea, idea, idea.

794
00:41:21,837 --> 00:41:23,898
And then the game flips over to the second half,

795
00:41:23,998 --> 00:41:25,059
and now you're the goalkeeper.

796
00:41:25,379 --> 00:41:26,800
You've got a game that's essentially done,

797
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,742
you've got enough stuff in here that's good to go.

798
00:41:29,182 --> 00:41:30,343
Now you're defending the goal.

799
00:41:30,443 --> 00:41:31,524
It's gonna get this game done,

800
00:41:31,544 --> 00:41:33,105
and we're not gonna try and score any more goals.

801
00:41:33,125 --> 00:41:34,266
You're just trying to finish this project.

802
00:41:34,286 --> 00:41:35,186
I think you did a good job,

803
00:41:35,847 --> 00:41:37,288
boxing it off and taking it to the finish.

804
00:41:38,269 --> 00:41:38,689
Thank you, Bruce.

805
00:41:38,709 --> 00:41:39,610
Thank you.

806
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:40,010
You're welcome.

807
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:45,571
Kudos to Brian Reynolds for adding the modding feature to.

808
00:41:46,952 --> 00:41:50,277
Hmm, so who is this young, handsome young man here?

809
00:41:50,337 --> 00:41:51,559
That picture was taken three years ago.

810
00:41:56,663 --> 00:42:02,709
I think another significant part of what Civilization was, was the manual that Bruce created.

811
00:42:04,251 --> 00:42:10,758
It was, again, it made the game, I think, seem important, seem like a game that you

812
00:42:10,798 --> 00:42:14,241
needed to play, seem that you needed to tell other people that you were playing because

813
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:15,162
it meant you were cool.

814
00:42:15,854 --> 00:42:18,397
because you could handle creating a civilization.

815
00:42:19,958 --> 00:42:20,639
And it was really a,

816
00:42:22,682 --> 00:42:24,444
it wasn't just about how to play,

817
00:42:24,504 --> 00:42:26,066
but there was a lot of background information,

818
00:42:26,086 --> 00:42:29,409
there was some great historical information,

819
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:29,970
and I think it-

820
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:31,111
Suggested reading.

821
00:42:31,512 --> 00:42:31,872
Suggested.

822
00:42:32,213 --> 00:42:32,453
Wow.

823
00:42:32,854 --> 00:42:33,614
You want to know the real story.

824
00:42:36,504 --> 00:42:43,049
Right. So I think it really complemented the game in a way that we just don't, you know,

825
00:42:43,109 --> 00:42:48,873
that doesn't happen anymore. But it gave the game kind of a weight and an importance that...

826
00:42:48,893 --> 00:42:50,915
Gravitas is a word I would use sometimes.

827
00:42:51,095 --> 00:42:54,537
Yeah, it's a shame they don't do that anymore, but you know, people don't want,

828
00:42:54,557 --> 00:42:57,620
they don't have time to read.

829
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,461
Not even the manual, let alone the suggested reading.

830
00:42:59,521 --> 00:43:01,863
I don't read manuals. I don't read a manual of anything.

831
00:43:02,893 --> 00:43:04,075
It's not intuitive.

832
00:43:04,115 --> 00:43:05,799
I mean, we're trained now to do it all.

833
00:43:06,721 --> 00:43:09,106
Take them through the first time of user experience.

834
00:43:09,126 --> 00:43:12,634
When they're done, they know how to play, and it's all seamless, and you've got three

835
00:43:12,654 --> 00:43:13,455
minutes to make it happen.

836
00:43:14,462 --> 00:43:16,504
Now this was actually not unique to civilization.

837
00:43:16,584 --> 00:43:20,088
Railroad Tycoon wrote, again, a very comprehensive manual.

838
00:43:20,169 --> 00:43:22,632
It was, even with our F-15 products,

839
00:43:22,812 --> 00:43:27,097
we were trying to take this very limited technology

840
00:43:27,197 --> 00:43:29,520
and make it feel awesome and epic and important.

841
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:34,105
And the manual had a significant part to play in that.

842
00:43:35,447 --> 00:43:39,770
Also this has given an opportunity to tell some of the real story because like again another point

843
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:42,973
I've made over the past is that we borrowed from the historical record stuff

844
00:43:42,993 --> 00:43:48,317
We thought would make a great game. We left stuff back there that we didn't think would help like there's no slavery

845
00:43:48,357 --> 00:43:52,040
There's no black plague or something like that. There's no religious wars

846
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:56,664
you know, so those are all certainly part of the historic record the history of Western civilization per se but

847
00:43:57,584 --> 00:43:58,925
we didn't see how they were going to add to the game.

848
00:43:59,005 --> 00:44:01,188
So, you know, the idea is to entertain people,

849
00:44:01,248 --> 00:44:02,269
not teach history.

850
00:44:02,529 --> 00:44:03,530
I think you can learn things,

851
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:05,412
and we can introduce you to maybe go down the road

852
00:44:05,432 --> 00:44:06,513
to go to the library and read more,

853
00:44:06,553 --> 00:44:09,757
but we're focusing on making entertainment software.

854
00:44:10,706 --> 00:44:15,310
Yeah, that reminds me, one of the first concepts that I had for the game was the rise and fall of civilization.

855
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:19,093
That you would build a civilization, but then you'd have this kind of setback,

856
00:44:19,814 --> 00:44:22,436
and then you'd kind of come back from that even stronger,

857
00:44:22,456 --> 00:44:27,861
and it wouldn't be so satisfying to overcome this adversity, whether it's the plague or something,

858
00:44:28,542 --> 00:44:33,246
and come back even stronger and awesomer, and then it would just be awesome and totally awesome.

859
00:44:33,826 --> 00:44:34,007
But...

860
00:44:35,508 --> 00:44:37,811
What we found happened is as soon as this plague hit

861
00:44:37,831 --> 00:44:40,435
or this setback happened, people would reload their game

862
00:44:40,455 --> 00:44:43,980
from five turns ago and kind of try to avoid it.

863
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:48,227
So it became the rise and rise and rise of Civilization.

864
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:51,670
The fall was...

865
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:53,350
I think we sort of learned that lesson

866
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:54,170
making Railroad Tycoon,

867
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:55,911
because you had these floods that would wipe out

868
00:44:55,951 --> 00:44:56,551
your railroad.

869
00:44:56,991 --> 00:44:58,631
If you built the really expensive bridge,

870
00:44:58,651 --> 00:45:00,472
you gave people, and there was no help for that.

871
00:45:00,492 --> 00:45:01,792
You couldn't stop this from happening.

872
00:45:02,072 --> 00:45:03,892
It was so dispiriting to have your railroad

873
00:45:03,932 --> 00:45:05,273
crushed by this random event.

874
00:45:05,553 --> 00:45:06,613
Computer was having the fun.

875
00:45:06,993 --> 00:45:07,713
Player wasn't having the fun,

876
00:45:07,733 --> 00:45:08,653
the computer was having the fun.

877
00:45:09,033 --> 00:45:10,454
So that was one of your points, too.

878
00:45:10,494 --> 00:45:11,574
The player should have the fun,

879
00:45:11,614 --> 00:45:13,054
not the computer, not the researcher,

880
00:45:13,074 --> 00:45:15,194
not the writer, not the computer, however.

881
00:45:15,235 --> 00:45:15,975
So I think...

882
00:45:16,625 --> 00:45:22,648
We had floods in civilization that could wreck your city and then you gave them a wall or something

883
00:45:22,688 --> 00:45:27,070
that they could build and it stopped the flooding. So you built that wall and you didn't worry about

884
00:45:27,110 --> 00:45:30,631
floods anymore. The player had a solution to that kind of problem.

885
00:45:31,622 --> 00:45:33,722
Yeah, I think railroads is where the phrase,

886
00:45:33,802 --> 00:45:36,282
what were we thinking was first.

887
00:45:36,883 --> 00:45:42,284
But I will claim that Civ I introduced the idea

888
00:45:42,304 --> 00:45:44,384
of global warming back in 1990,

889
00:45:44,744 --> 00:45:47,925
because that was actually a thing in Civ I,

890
00:45:47,965 --> 00:45:49,165
that if you had too much pollution,

891
00:45:50,085 --> 00:45:52,906
the seas would rise and you'd lose your coastal cities.

892
00:45:53,006 --> 00:45:55,646
So way ahead of our time, way.

893
00:45:58,925 --> 00:46:05,083
too much information. Again, kind of reflecting, we had no idea what we were trying to do here.

894
00:46:07,145 --> 00:46:11,589
I thought it would be cool to have all this detailed demographic information about your

895
00:46:11,629 --> 00:46:18,475
Civ that would again make the game feel real and kind of you actually managing these people.

896
00:46:19,716 --> 00:46:23,600
These things did not survive to any of the later iterations of Civilization.

897
00:46:24,861 --> 00:46:25,642
Nobody was fooled.

898
00:46:25,942 --> 00:46:30,045
This is a game and I think people more and more looked at it as a game.

899
00:46:31,767 --> 00:46:34,289
kind of optimized their way through the tech tree and

900
00:46:34,569 --> 00:46:41,055
analyzed spearmen versus battleships. It kind of was not

901
00:46:41,495 --> 00:46:43,937
seen really as much of a role-playing experience, which

902
00:46:43,997 --> 00:46:47,720
is part of what we were trying to do with too much information

903
00:46:47,761 --> 00:46:52,044
here. But part of it was also these kind of attaboys, the top

904
00:46:52,064 --> 00:46:55,988
five cities in the world, ways of giving you some sense of how

905
00:46:56,008 --> 00:46:58,830
you are progressing and that you're kind of on the right

906
00:46:58,870 --> 00:46:59,110
track.

907
00:47:03,916 --> 00:47:08,440
So this is the, oh that's actually a GIF, wow.

908
00:47:09,541 --> 00:47:10,061
I didn't know that.

909
00:47:11,702 --> 00:47:14,404
So this is the introduction to civilization.

910
00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:18,908
And in the beginning the world was without form and void.

911
00:47:20,371 --> 00:47:24,313
We were really trying to make this feel like an important game.

912
00:47:25,334 --> 00:47:30,617
Jeff Briggs wrote this really cool piece of music reminiscent of Copland's Fanfare.

913
00:47:31,418 --> 00:47:34,679
And this is how you started to play.

914
00:47:36,501 --> 00:47:40,564
that we succeeded in kind of giving you the idea

915
00:47:41,324 --> 00:47:43,486
that this experience was going to be different

916
00:47:43,646 --> 00:47:45,268
from what was happening in other games

917
00:47:45,368 --> 00:47:48,750
and in kind of some important and significant way

918
00:47:49,411 --> 00:47:52,553
that this game kind of told you something

919
00:47:52,593 --> 00:47:53,654
about how the world worked

920
00:47:54,235 --> 00:47:56,216
and let you kind of take over

921
00:47:56,236 --> 00:47:59,899
at this very crucial point in the history of the world

922
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,101
and tell your own story.

923
00:48:02,701 --> 00:48:02,882
So...

924
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:07,732
Again, we were bold and young and audacious,

925
00:48:08,032 --> 00:48:09,634
and really trying to convince you

926
00:48:09,694 --> 00:48:15,318
that this was a game of historic significance,

927
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:19,321
little knowing, of course, that 25 years later,

928
00:48:19,341 --> 00:48:20,582
we'd be still talking about it.

929
00:48:20,662 --> 00:48:25,426
But I think we had no fear in those days,

930
00:48:25,486 --> 00:48:28,549
and this kind of represents our idea

931
00:48:28,589 --> 00:48:29,810
that we had created something special.

932
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:31,391
I think Bruce talks about how he felt

933
00:48:32,932 --> 00:48:34,033
that in Hunt Valley, Maryland.

934
00:48:34,972 --> 00:48:35,992
I'll let you tell that story, Bruce.

935
00:48:36,272 --> 00:48:37,913
Well, I just, people asked,

936
00:48:37,933 --> 00:48:39,714
did you know the game was going to be great

937
00:48:39,734 --> 00:48:40,414
when you were working on it?

938
00:48:40,454 --> 00:48:41,335
I said absolutely.

939
00:48:41,375 --> 00:48:44,296
And at some point I realized the whole world did not know,

940
00:48:44,316 --> 00:48:46,377
the gaming community did not know that in this little town,

941
00:48:46,437 --> 00:48:47,558
Hunt Valley, Maryland, north of Baltimore,

942
00:48:47,578 --> 00:48:49,178
we were making a game that was going to rock the world.

943
00:48:49,699 --> 00:48:51,500
I just felt really strongly about this game

944
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:55,622
is going to be great, it's going to have incredible success.

945
00:48:55,922 --> 00:48:57,202
People are going to love playing this game.

946
00:48:57,282 --> 00:48:59,063
I just felt really, I walked down, I told my,

947
00:48:59,827 --> 00:49:03,350
Girlfriend is now my wife. I said, you know if I could find a job make a living

948
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:06,852
I would do what I'm doing every day for free because this is so much fun. This is so cool

949
00:49:06,872 --> 00:49:12,156
What we're making is so important. I think I thought it was great. It was an incredible opportunity for me. I really loved it

950
00:49:14,118 --> 00:49:15,339
I'm not sure I had the same feeling

951
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:21,892
I enjoyed making the game, but I felt it was a bit out there.

952
00:49:22,752 --> 00:49:27,473
And so I felt very gratified when

953
00:49:27,493 --> 00:49:29,154
we started to get some positive response.

954
00:49:29,194 --> 00:49:30,734
But I definitely was up in the air

955
00:49:30,774 --> 00:49:33,135
as to whether we had kind of gone too far

956
00:49:34,196 --> 00:49:35,396
or this was going to work.

957
00:49:35,616 --> 00:49:37,678
I knew that when I could see other people sitting down,

958
00:49:37,718 --> 00:49:40,380
and myself, the time would just go flying by.

959
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:43,663
Like a psychologist called creating flow.

960
00:49:43,703 --> 00:49:45,684
You get into a flow pattern psychologically,

961
00:49:45,704 --> 00:49:48,046
and you just forget about the past your time.

962
00:49:48,827 --> 00:49:49,928
And I knew that was happening to me.

963
00:49:49,988 --> 00:49:51,729
I could see it happening to other people playing the game.

964
00:49:51,769 --> 00:49:53,411
I knew that that's the stuff.

965
00:49:53,951 --> 00:49:54,692
That's the real thing.

966
00:49:54,732 --> 00:49:55,412
If you can do that,

967
00:49:55,472 --> 00:49:57,554
then you've achieved something really successful.

968
00:49:58,875 --> 00:49:59,936
Speaking of time passing,

969
00:49:59,976 --> 00:50:02,838
the game shipped on eight five and a quarter inch

970
00:50:02,878 --> 00:50:03,619
floppy disks, so.

971
00:50:04,628 --> 00:50:07,951
Probably spent half an hour just loading it onto your PC.

972
00:50:10,293 --> 00:50:12,975
Probably one of the areas that we fell down

973
00:50:13,895 --> 00:50:15,977
was in actually testing the game.

974
00:50:18,367 --> 00:50:22,168
looking at the credit sheet from the manual, there were, I think,

975
00:50:22,628 --> 00:50:27,150
five testers that we had at the end of this project to test the

976
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:30,331
game, in addition to all the playing that Bruce and I did.

977
00:50:30,391 --> 00:50:34,852
But the idea of intensive testing was not as well

978
00:50:34,912 --> 00:50:36,233
established back in those days.

979
00:50:38,144 --> 00:50:40,726
Even though the game was pretty solid,

980
00:50:41,026 --> 00:50:43,668
there were two significant bugs in the game.

981
00:50:43,728 --> 00:50:47,491
They're not bugs, but they're the kind of exploits,

982
00:50:47,651 --> 00:50:48,832
I'd say we call them these days.

983
00:50:48,852 --> 00:50:49,773
Oh, that's what I was going to say.

984
00:50:49,933 --> 00:50:51,635
By building lots and lots of cities,

985
00:50:51,695 --> 00:50:56,738
you could kind of grease your path to success.

986
00:50:57,699 --> 00:51:02,402
And we actually ended up adding this idea of corruption to

987
00:51:02,702 --> 00:51:03,303
balance that out.

988
00:51:04,003 --> 00:51:06,925
And the other thing we didn't realize in our testing was

989
00:51:06,945 --> 00:51:09,186
that the chariot unit was amazingly

990
00:51:09,706 --> 00:51:11,508
overpowered for its cost.

991
00:51:12,188 --> 00:51:15,010
It was a 412 for attack factor.

992
00:51:15,590 --> 00:51:19,192
And it was pretty much a cool way to overrun the entire

993
00:51:19,252 --> 00:51:22,454
world, so we ended up making it a 312, which was perfect.

994
00:51:24,475 --> 00:51:25,536
the power of one number.

995
00:51:26,997 --> 00:51:28,918
But otherwise, the game was pretty solid.

996
00:51:28,938 --> 00:51:32,240
We had no option, of course, for a day one patch or any of

997
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:35,142
the tools that we have today to update things.

998
00:51:35,202 --> 00:51:41,245
So a few things we missed at the time, but overall it was

999
00:51:41,285 --> 00:51:41,786
pretty solid.

1000
00:51:43,086 --> 00:51:46,708
I wanted to leave a little time for questions, so we're

1001
00:51:47,329 --> 00:51:47,749
going to kind of.

1002
00:51:49,874 --> 00:51:52,675
End our presentation there.

1003
00:51:54,557 --> 00:51:57,219
And just open it up for questions,

1004
00:51:57,279 --> 00:52:00,241
if you have questions about the game or the process

1005
00:52:00,481 --> 00:52:03,243
by which it was made, or our personal lives,

1006
00:52:03,283 --> 00:52:04,784
anything like that.

1007
00:52:07,185 --> 00:52:07,586
Hello.

1008
00:52:07,606 --> 00:52:11,648
So I've played Civilization now for something

1009
00:52:11,688 --> 00:52:14,010
like 14,000 hours over the past 20 years.

1010
00:52:14,971 --> 00:52:17,833
And thank you for taking a good chunk of my life.

1011
00:52:20,293 --> 00:52:25,600
I wanted to ask, how did you decide upon the original assortment of civilizations?

1012
00:52:27,022 --> 00:52:31,327
Well, we were certainly looking at recognizable leaders.

1013
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:36,394
I think the, again, reading through history.

1014
00:52:38,397 --> 00:52:40,860
We tried to give each Civ a personality, certain special

1015
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:43,625
abilities and things like that that would make the game play

1016
00:52:43,665 --> 00:52:46,589
different each time you actually be encouraged to play the

1017
00:52:46,609 --> 00:52:49,233
different Civs and have a slightly different experience.

1018
00:52:49,954 --> 00:52:51,637
I think that...

1019
00:52:52,792 --> 00:52:55,472
Looking back, Chairman Mao is the leader of the Chinese.

1020
00:52:55,512 --> 00:52:57,433
We could not pull that off today.

1021
00:52:57,893 --> 00:53:00,593
There's a number of things we did there

1022
00:53:00,673 --> 00:53:03,214
that actually the world has changed,

1023
00:53:03,234 --> 00:53:04,634
and we can't do anymore.

1024
00:53:04,694 --> 00:53:10,415
But I think it was looking for these leader characters

1025
00:53:10,455 --> 00:53:12,536
that had some really interesting personality

1026
00:53:12,596 --> 00:53:15,156
and would be fun to interact with.

1027
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:21,211
I just think that I um because I was responsible for some of the research and trying to accomplish it

1028
00:53:21,311 --> 00:53:23,492
So you may have asked me for what are the good choices?

1029
00:53:23,572 --> 00:53:26,073
And you might have said well, give me some leaders and give me some civil

1030
00:53:26,093 --> 00:53:29,434
I don't remember now, but I would have thought about the great civilizations

1031
00:53:29,494 --> 00:53:36,016
Oh, you know of Western civilization primarily, but we also had India and places like I'm not sure just we thought were significant

1032
00:53:36,036 --> 00:53:40,358
There's been big empires or big civilizations were worth, you know putting in the game

1033
00:53:41,398 --> 00:53:42,898
Thank you very much. Thank you

1034
00:53:44,404 --> 00:53:49,508
Okay. Hi. My name is Mateusz Pilski and I have an indie

1035
00:53:49,528 --> 00:53:53,211
studio called Ice Cold Games and right now we are creating a game

1036
00:53:53,291 --> 00:53:56,834
called Cold where you create your own cold and fight with

1037
00:53:56,874 --> 00:54:00,177
colds of your opponents. And because of that I have a

1038
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:02,939
question. Did you have any

1039
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:13,863
concerns or problems when you put in the civilization religions as tools for taking dominance over

1040
00:54:13,943 --> 00:54:21,985
the world? Religion has been a topic we've been very careful with. The original SIV had

1041
00:54:22,265 --> 00:54:27,767
a very basic system of temples and cathedrals and creating happiness.

1042
00:54:31,438 --> 00:54:35,024
after that, succeeding SIVs have gone more into depth with

1043
00:54:35,425 --> 00:54:38,691
religion systems and kind of spreading your religion and

1044
00:54:38,711 --> 00:54:43,660
things like that. But it's always been not taking a kind of

1045
00:54:45,496 --> 00:54:48,357
any sort of position in terms of one religion being better

1046
00:54:48,637 --> 00:54:50,497
or worse or whatever than another.

1047
00:54:50,517 --> 00:54:53,898
And it's kind of a fundamental idea of Civ

1048
00:54:53,939 --> 00:54:58,480
that we're not trying to impose our vision

1049
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:00,481
of what's right or what's wrong.

1050
00:55:00,601 --> 00:55:03,102
Whenever the designer kind of steps to the front

1051
00:55:03,142 --> 00:55:04,522
and says this is how you should play

1052
00:55:04,542 --> 00:55:05,642
or this is what's right or wrong,

1053
00:55:06,043 --> 00:55:07,883
it takes the agency away from the player

1054
00:55:08,043 --> 00:55:10,324
and then that's kind of the designer having the fun

1055
00:55:10,364 --> 00:55:11,685
as opposed to the player having the fun.

1056
00:55:12,265 --> 00:55:17,630
So in Civ the idea is that we let you kind of explore your own

1057
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:21,693
thoughts about whether you want a big army or whether you want

1058
00:55:21,713 --> 00:55:23,895
to create world peace or whether culture is the way to go.

1059
00:55:23,915 --> 00:55:25,616
I mean, you always have those options in Civ.

1060
00:55:26,257 --> 00:55:29,700
And part of that is us not taking a stand on specific

1061
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:33,683
religious issue or cultural issues or things like that.

1062
00:55:33,884 --> 00:55:35,265
So that's kind of how we approach that.

1063
00:55:36,206 --> 00:55:36,326
OK.

1064
00:55:36,426 --> 00:55:36,666
Thank you.

1065
00:55:39,904 --> 00:55:45,666
First of all, thank you both. This game I credit with giving me my love of history. My

1066
00:55:45,706 --> 00:55:50,708
favorite thing of the entire franchise is in Civ 1, the end of the game, you got to replay your

1067
00:55:50,728 --> 00:55:55,910
game and it gave you a real good sense of this is what I did. It seems to have died in the

1068
00:55:55,970 --> 00:56:02,012
franchise and never gotten the same amount of effort. I was just curious why. You'll have to

1069
00:56:02,052 --> 00:56:05,874
come to Ed Meach's talk, which is coming up in half an hour.

1070
00:56:08,007 --> 00:56:09,368
I actually don't have an answer to that.

1071
00:56:09,528 --> 00:56:13,990
I think that we did put the replay in Civ 1,

1072
00:56:14,671 --> 00:56:16,732
in spite of a lot of technical limitations,

1073
00:56:17,032 --> 00:56:21,194
to give you that sense of reliving what had happened.

1074
00:56:23,195 --> 00:56:26,737
But I'll make a note of that.

1075
00:56:26,757 --> 00:56:27,317
Thank you.

1076
00:56:28,535 --> 00:56:31,596
Hi, my name is Salman from Google.

1077
00:56:32,337 --> 00:56:34,838
I grew up with Civilization.

1078
00:56:34,858 --> 00:56:36,439
I played all of them, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

1079
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:41,182
And on that note about growing up with Sid,

1080
00:56:41,282 --> 00:56:42,622
I have my own four-year-old son.

1081
00:56:43,363 --> 00:56:46,324
And I'm looking to basically have him play that game soon.

1082
00:56:48,706 --> 00:56:53,567
But I look back at Solution 1 and there really was very high educational value.

1083
00:56:54,308 --> 00:57:00,110
In those days of the term edutainment, it really kind of like, that's how I get my dad

1084
00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:02,711
to buy CIV 2 because CIV 1 was so educational.

1085
00:57:03,611 --> 00:57:06,892
And that was really kind of, I felt lost.

1086
00:57:08,453 --> 00:57:12,234
Because in CIV 1, every time you would discover something, you would have to read about it.

1087
00:57:13,515 --> 00:57:19,938
And so that's the amount of stuff I learned from that game is just endless, you know, you talked about too much for GDP

1088
00:57:20,039 --> 00:57:21,059
I learned GDP from that

1089
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:29,163
You know Chairman Mao I learned about him through civilization, you know

1090
00:57:30,824 --> 00:57:32,386
I would go to school and history class,

1091
00:57:32,646 --> 00:57:34,508
oh I already know what conscription is because

1092
00:57:35,309 --> 00:57:36,110
you know I discovered it.

1093
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:37,912
And it was really amazing.

1094
00:57:37,992 --> 00:57:40,274
But in CIF II, it kind of became like

1095
00:57:40,294 --> 00:57:42,397
you have to click the description tab or something

1096
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:43,097
I don't remember exactly.

1097
00:57:43,558 --> 00:57:46,181
And there was a lot of stuff in terms of this.

1098
00:57:47,611 --> 00:57:53,236
you know, historical sense, and learning about history and technology and all these things

1099
00:57:53,576 --> 00:57:55,598
that I felt, you know, has been lost.

1100
00:57:55,638 --> 00:58:00,882
Like, it was, it seemed like there seems to have, there was a bit of a conscious decision

1101
00:58:00,962 --> 00:58:06,627
saying that, hey, you know what, it's more of a game than an educational software.

1102
00:58:06,728 --> 00:58:12,973
But I would love, especially for my son, right, for this franchise to go more towards the

1103
00:58:12,993 --> 00:58:14,514
educational audience that it's originally given.

1104
00:58:15,075 --> 00:58:18,517
And this stuff like Civil War, I would go attack the capital

1105
00:58:18,537 --> 00:58:19,378
just to give Civil War.

1106
00:58:19,398 --> 00:58:20,539
A lot of this stuff was lost.

1107
00:58:21,219 --> 00:58:23,241
I'd like to see more of that.

1108
00:58:24,502 --> 00:58:26,723
So I'm hearing we need to bring back Civ I.

1109
00:58:31,467 --> 00:58:33,248
And by the way, four years is a great age

1110
00:58:33,308 --> 00:58:35,149
to start playing Civilization.

1111
00:58:35,770 --> 00:58:36,950
I think that'd be wonderful.

1112
00:58:37,791 --> 00:58:41,914
I do think it's true that, and if you look on the Civ forums,

1113
00:58:43,565 --> 00:58:46,388
players get very intense about the gameplay.

1114
00:58:46,448 --> 00:58:47,549
So there definitely is an audience

1115
00:58:47,589 --> 00:58:49,631
for this kind of streamlined gameplay,

1116
00:58:49,812 --> 00:58:51,213
this very focused gameplay.

1117
00:58:52,554 --> 00:58:53,175
But I hear what you're saying,

1118
00:58:53,195 --> 00:58:56,838
there's also an audience for kind of a learning-based

1119
00:58:58,320 --> 00:58:59,421
approach to civilization.

1120
00:59:00,262 --> 00:59:01,683
We don't actually talk about education

1121
00:59:01,743 --> 00:59:02,684
as being a part of the game.

1122
00:59:03,465 --> 00:59:04,545
because that's like a dirty word.

1123
00:59:04,645 --> 00:59:08,807
But we think learning actually is an important part

1124
00:59:08,827 --> 00:59:09,127
of the game.

1125
00:59:09,907 --> 00:59:11,387
The sense that you get as playing,

1126
00:59:11,828 --> 00:59:12,988
that you now know a little more,

1127
00:59:13,388 --> 00:59:15,209
whether it's about playing the game or about history

1128
00:59:15,249 --> 00:59:16,929
or about leaders or GDP.

1129
00:59:18,490 --> 00:59:21,891
I think that learning is kind of a secret aspect

1130
00:59:21,931 --> 00:59:25,472
of the game that brings you back to learn more

1131
00:59:25,552 --> 00:59:27,333
and to kind of feel better about yourself.

1132
00:59:27,373 --> 00:59:29,073
But thank you for that, for those comments.

1133
00:59:30,255 --> 00:59:32,618
Hi, thank you for this amazing game, it's so fun.

1134
00:59:33,739 --> 00:59:36,802
My question is, how do you think about adding,

1135
00:59:37,142 --> 00:59:39,905
removing complexity from one game to the next,

1136
00:59:40,206 --> 00:59:41,667
and where and how do you think about it?

1137
00:59:42,637 --> 00:59:45,058
Well, we, a couple things that we,

1138
00:59:45,719 --> 00:59:47,199
we've gotten to the point where we feel the game

1139
00:59:47,259 --> 00:59:49,180
has the right amount of complexity.

1140
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:51,481
So for every new system that we add,

1141
00:59:51,521 --> 00:59:52,462
or new idea that we add,

1142
00:59:52,482 --> 00:59:53,763
we're gonna pull something else out

1143
00:59:53,783 --> 00:59:54,943
to kind of keep it at that level.

1144
00:59:55,823 --> 00:59:58,085
And we also have this rule at Firaxis,

1145
00:59:58,105 --> 00:59:59,925
which we call the 1 3rd, 1 3rd, 1 3rd rule,

1146
00:59:59,965 --> 01:00:03,027
which is kind of 1 3rd of the game is core.

1147
01:00:03,147 --> 01:00:05,028
It's the way Sim works, it's turn-based,

1148
01:00:05,108 --> 01:00:06,549
it's gonna have cities, it's gonna have units,

1149
01:00:06,569 --> 01:00:08,389
it's gonna have wonders, it's gonna have these pieces.

1150
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:15,053
Another third is taking ideas that we experimented with before and kind of taking what we learned,

1151
01:00:15,073 --> 01:00:18,295
whether it's a religion system or an SB&R system or a way of doing combat,

1152
01:00:19,055 --> 01:00:22,017
and taking what we learned and making that better.

1153
01:00:22,557 --> 01:00:26,039
And then another third is new things, things that we haven't put in the game before.

1154
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:30,143
kind of mixing those all together, those different thirds,

1155
01:00:30,563 --> 01:00:34,407
is kind of what guides the next iteration of civilization.

1156
01:00:34,427 --> 01:00:36,929
There's enough novelty, enough new to make it

1157
01:00:37,590 --> 01:00:40,012
a different experience, but enough of that core gameplay

1158
01:00:40,052 --> 01:00:41,193
that it's a SID game.

1159
01:00:42,034 --> 01:00:42,254
Thank you.

1160
01:00:44,377 --> 01:00:47,340
Hi, I'm Adrian Troy from Zooks, the self-driving car company.

1161
01:00:48,182 --> 01:00:52,347
I love civilization, and I also love the old 1980 board game

1162
01:00:52,387 --> 01:00:55,451
Civilization, which had tech trees and all these kinds of

1163
01:00:55,491 --> 01:00:57,193
things, and I was wondering if you guys played that and were

1164
01:00:57,233 --> 01:00:58,314
influenced by it at all.

1165
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:02,282
That was a licensed game.

1166
01:01:02,782 --> 01:01:04,343
I mean, there's this cycle now.

1167
01:01:04,563 --> 01:01:06,484
There was originally a Civilization board game,

1168
01:01:06,504 --> 01:01:08,225
and then we did the computer game,

1169
01:01:08,245 --> 01:01:10,586
and then there was a board game based on that.

1170
01:01:10,786 --> 01:01:14,888
And so it's, you know, again, this synergy.

1171
01:01:14,909 --> 01:01:17,090
And a lot of our inspiration for the original Civ

1172
01:01:17,170 --> 01:01:19,711
was kind of a war gaming background and things like that.

1173
01:01:20,251 --> 01:01:21,712
So they're related.

1174
01:01:23,213 --> 01:01:27,577
And I think one of the charms of the board game

1175
01:01:27,637 --> 01:01:29,378
is more the multiplayer aspect,

1176
01:01:29,418 --> 01:01:30,599
you know, playing together with friends,

1177
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:32,201
and the social component,

1178
01:01:32,221 --> 01:01:34,042
which you don't always get playing a computer game.

1179
01:01:34,082 --> 01:01:35,764
So they each have their strengths,

1180
01:01:35,804 --> 01:01:37,706
and I think they can reinforce each other.

1181
01:01:44,011 --> 01:01:45,572
Okay, I'm getting this symbol.

1182
01:01:46,233 --> 01:01:47,354
Thank you very much for coming.

1183
01:01:47,774 --> 01:01:48,735
Thank you for supporting.

1184
01:01:59,994 --> 01:02:01,295
Thank you for supporting CIV.

1185
01:02:02,137 --> 01:02:04,139
Thanks especially to Bruce for coming.

1186
01:02:04,159 --> 01:02:05,842
My pleasure. Enjoy.
