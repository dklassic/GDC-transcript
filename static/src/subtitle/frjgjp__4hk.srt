1
00:00:05,333 --> 00:00:06,134
Great, thank you very much.

2
00:00:06,154 --> 00:00:08,175
It's lovely to be here at the AI Summit.

3
00:00:08,555 --> 00:00:10,616
I'm really thrilled and honored.

4
00:00:11,276 --> 00:00:14,138
And the opportunity, I'd love the opportunity

5
00:00:14,178 --> 00:00:15,739
to sort of expand the conversation

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,800
to some new areas that we've been thinking about

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,661
really deeply at our studio at Xeo Design.

8
00:00:22,182 --> 00:00:24,744
within the realm of what player experiences are

9
00:00:24,804 --> 00:00:27,206
and how computers can create richer and deeper emotions.

10
00:00:27,826 --> 00:00:30,769
So we're gonna talk today about Red Pill,

11
00:00:30,889 --> 00:00:33,591
Red Pill, Blue Pill, Narrative AI for Deeper Emotions.

12
00:00:33,671 --> 00:00:34,712
And in it we're taking,

13
00:00:34,732 --> 00:00:37,494
we're gonna leverage some experiences that I've had

14
00:00:38,515 --> 00:00:40,216
and you also have had,

15
00:00:40,557 --> 00:00:42,759
in one of the most emotional medium we have,

16
00:00:42,819 --> 00:00:44,760
which is of course cinema.

17
00:00:47,362 --> 00:00:50,402
So I'm one of the leading experts on emotion in games.

18
00:00:50,902 --> 00:00:54,703
And I have a model called the Four Keys to Fun, which I

19
00:00:54,883 --> 00:00:58,404
used, I basically measured emotion on people's faces

20
00:00:58,444 --> 00:00:59,144
while they played.

21
00:01:00,084 --> 00:01:03,845
And I created a model about what kinds of actions players

22
00:01:04,025 --> 00:01:06,405
did to create different emotions.

23
00:01:07,046 --> 00:01:10,206
So from that perspective is what we're going to do today.

24
00:01:10,566 --> 00:01:13,347
I've also studied psychology at Stanford and a little bit

25
00:01:13,387 --> 00:01:14,407
of filmmaking.

26
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:19,226
The Four Keys has been used to inspire the AI for the Sims.

27
00:01:20,607 --> 00:01:21,589
We brought Wonder to Myst.

28
00:01:21,669 --> 00:01:25,293
We actually created some AR and VR UI for iFluence

29
00:01:25,993 --> 00:01:28,937
and did Star Wars on Star Wars games.

30
00:01:29,557 --> 00:01:30,799
And the Four Keys is actually going

31
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:32,361
beyond the realm of games in a sense

32
00:01:32,381 --> 00:01:35,284
that this model of how action and emotion interact.

33
00:01:36,365 --> 00:01:41,089
I don't work with everyone from Samantha Bee to Ted,

34
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:45,013
IBM Watson, the semantic analysis,

35
00:01:45,353 --> 00:01:48,196
sentiment analysis on IBM Watson is inspired by my work.

36
00:01:49,323 --> 00:01:52,004
And then we're doing stuff on emotion,

37
00:01:52,044 --> 00:01:53,785
a lot of emotion in XR and VR.

38
00:01:53,805 --> 00:01:56,106
So we're gonna talk a little tiny, tiny bit about that.

39
00:01:56,946 --> 00:01:58,987
Because I think that on the computer side,

40
00:01:59,067 --> 00:02:02,949
AI plays a key role in some of these newer game platforms,

41
00:02:03,029 --> 00:02:04,029
especially with AR.

42
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:08,010
This is a montage from one of the games I'm working on

43
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:09,811
called Aladdin's Cave of Wonder.

44
00:02:09,831 --> 00:02:10,771
We're doing it on Magic Leap.

45
00:02:10,871 --> 00:02:13,713
So a combination of real-world item recognition

46
00:02:13,793 --> 00:02:15,373
and being able to recognize your hand gestures

47
00:02:15,453 --> 00:02:17,254
is gonna create a much deeper experience.

48
00:02:18,422 --> 00:02:20,603
for players, but not out of the box.

49
00:02:20,623 --> 00:02:22,243
We really have to understand what emotion is

50
00:02:22,283 --> 00:02:23,564
and how it gets done.

51
00:02:24,764 --> 00:02:25,945
So this is the Four Keys to Fun.

52
00:02:25,965 --> 00:02:27,426
You can download it on our website.

53
00:02:28,006 --> 00:02:29,486
There's some white papers and other talks.

54
00:02:29,626 --> 00:02:32,148
We're gonna go into not so much the four keys,

55
00:02:32,188 --> 00:02:33,868
but how it applies to AI.

56
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:36,349
We're in the process of a many year journey

57
00:02:36,369 --> 00:02:39,190
of developing in our studio an emotion engine,

58
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:39,971
we like to call it.

59
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:44,093
It's a way of creating emotions from the actions in games.

60
00:02:44,967 --> 00:02:46,347
A few quick things on emotion.

61
00:02:46,648 --> 00:02:49,209
The first thing is that in games, best-selling games,

62
00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:52,111
people's favorite games, that mechanics tend to fall into

63
00:02:52,151 --> 00:02:52,791
nested loops.

64
00:02:53,472 --> 00:02:54,712
Here are four of them.

65
00:02:56,393 --> 00:03:00,376
There is a micro loop, a core loop, a meta loop, and a social

66
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:01,116
re-engagement loop.

67
00:03:01,997 --> 00:03:04,538
and that emotion and cognition are intertwined.

68
00:03:05,138 --> 00:03:07,039
So that may not necessarily be represented

69
00:03:07,219 --> 00:03:08,879
in your AI implementation,

70
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:10,500
but we need to know on the wetware,

71
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,741
they definitely coexist.

72
00:03:13,521 --> 00:03:16,122
Sense making and emotions are the same.

73
00:03:16,943 --> 00:03:18,503
Actions and feeling are also related,

74
00:03:18,743 --> 00:03:20,464
and so if we ignore the player action

75
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:23,445
as a vital agent in our AI systems,

76
00:03:24,005 --> 00:03:27,847
then we are ignoring a lot of what they feel.

77
00:03:29,147 --> 00:03:31,368
And so interaction, in a sense, designs emotion.

78
00:03:32,163 --> 00:03:37,309
as well as art and acting and other things that you may have already built AI systems

79
00:03:37,369 --> 00:03:37,689
around.

80
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:42,855
Now, just like birds and planes, they both fly, but they fly differently.

81
00:03:44,476 --> 00:03:45,558
Same thing is true with games.

82
00:03:45,718 --> 00:03:49,362
Both movies create emotion and games create emotion.

83
00:03:50,023 --> 00:03:53,687
But they also have different mechanics, different ways of going about it.

84
00:03:54,447 --> 00:03:58,391
Now, when we start any genre, any new genre often leverages the old genre.

85
00:03:58,591 --> 00:04:04,536
So we have a lot to learn from film, but we also want to take and, you know, scrape away

86
00:04:04,576 --> 00:04:06,137
the stuff that maybe we don't need.

87
00:04:06,778 --> 00:04:11,882
So this is some scenes from Detroit, which has got an amazing narrative design for the

88
00:04:11,922 --> 00:04:14,024
characters, the three main characters especially.

89
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:18,127
But there are 3,000 pages of shooting script, which took two and a half years to shoot,

90
00:04:18,908 --> 00:04:22,050
which is way beyond the production length of most feature films.

91
00:04:23,181 --> 00:04:26,586
And we've got a very labor intensive branching narrative

92
00:04:26,626 --> 00:04:30,392
that you have to design by hand, construct by hand

93
00:04:30,432 --> 00:04:32,074
to create the compelling character

94
00:04:32,134 --> 00:04:32,895
arcs and other things.

95
00:04:33,855 --> 00:04:35,995
So in thinking for this talk, what I wanted to do

96
00:04:36,035 --> 00:04:37,176
was look at, well, what could we do

97
00:04:37,756 --> 00:04:38,856
instead of branching narrative?

98
00:04:39,277 --> 00:04:42,758
How could we apply other systems to the core of the game?

99
00:04:43,878 --> 00:04:45,639
So narrative is what, interactive narrative

100
00:04:45,679 --> 00:04:48,060
is what got me into games 26 years ago.

101
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,301
And it's still what keeps me coming back.

102
00:04:51,901 --> 00:04:53,781
So what would that narrative AI look like?

103
00:04:54,885 --> 00:04:57,887
Well, some simple, very simple AI systems

104
00:04:57,907 --> 00:05:00,868
that we already have that increases engagement.

105
00:05:00,908 --> 00:05:03,149
So the rubber banding that in Mario Kart

106
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:06,890
keeps it engaging even if you're working with an NPC

107
00:05:07,031 --> 00:05:08,551
or if you're playing with your friends.

108
00:05:10,732 --> 00:05:12,473
But then let's say we do,

109
00:05:12,793 --> 00:05:15,594
but AI, modern AI has done some really interesting things.

110
00:05:15,654 --> 00:05:16,995
And I stopped for inspiration.

111
00:05:17,215 --> 00:05:18,976
Here's where my sort of talk begins.

112
00:05:19,856 --> 00:05:21,537
If we think about the fake faces,

113
00:05:21,577 --> 00:05:23,278
how many people have seen this video?

114
00:05:24,345 --> 00:05:25,166
Yeah, not too many?

115
00:05:25,226 --> 00:05:25,486
OK.

116
00:05:25,986 --> 00:05:32,373
So there are three layers to the generative adversarial

117
00:05:32,413 --> 00:05:32,753
networks.

118
00:05:34,115 --> 00:05:35,917
There are three layers.

119
00:05:35,957 --> 00:05:36,817
And what they're able to do is they're

120
00:05:36,858 --> 00:05:39,720
able to create real looking faces that actually

121
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,541
don't exist.

122
00:05:41,662 --> 00:05:43,684
So there are different features that they are leveraging

123
00:05:43,905 --> 00:05:44,746
at the three layers.

124
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:49,412
And then they can apply this also technique to other things

125
00:05:50,092 --> 00:05:51,474
to create believable styles.

126
00:05:52,254 --> 00:05:54,956
So on the right, you have hotel rooms that don't exist

127
00:05:55,237 --> 00:05:57,138
and on the left, cars that don't exist.

128
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:03,043
So what might this mean in terms of gameplay?

129
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:05,605
Might we be able to create AI systems

130
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:07,967
that actually designed game mechanics for us

131
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,791
or created more robust things for us?

132
00:06:11,851 --> 00:06:12,911
Well, I think that we wanna look at it

133
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:13,772
like a peanut butter cup.

134
00:06:13,972 --> 00:06:15,614
I like chocolate, I don't know about you, but.

135
00:06:16,595 --> 00:06:19,717
You know, there's a center of game, which I think is still going to be the game mechanic,

136
00:06:19,737 --> 00:06:22,559
but as a first step, we could probably design the chocolate coating.

137
00:06:22,579 --> 00:06:27,163
We could probably design a layer of AI, of narrative AI, surrounding the core experience

138
00:06:27,203 --> 00:06:31,907
that expands the emotional palette, the emotion architecture, the ebb and flow of the emotions

139
00:06:31,947 --> 00:06:32,428
in the player.

140
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:35,590
So, but here's a few more things to do that.

141
00:06:36,071 --> 00:06:40,374
The first is that in cognition and emotion, there's really, you know, threat of life is

142
00:06:40,414 --> 00:06:42,516
just one way of generating emotion.

143
00:06:42,876 --> 00:06:43,877
It just generates one emotion.

144
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:48,308
And the other thing is that in the neocortex and the lizard brain,

145
00:06:48,588 --> 00:06:50,450
the neocortex is where we take action,

146
00:06:50,931 --> 00:06:53,394
whereas the lizard brain, your emotion centers are deeper down.

147
00:06:54,215 --> 00:06:56,058
You make decisions in the forebrain.

148
00:06:56,398 --> 00:07:01,545
You feel the result of them in your inner brain, your older brain.

149
00:07:03,096 --> 00:07:06,079
And so it is the interaction between the key

150
00:07:06,119 --> 00:07:07,441
to creating emotions for people,

151
00:07:08,121 --> 00:07:10,343
is the key is really making those choices.

152
00:07:10,844 --> 00:07:13,507
So going from between those two parts of your brain,

153
00:07:13,587 --> 00:07:17,290
back and forth, and how you feel before, during, and after.

154
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,772
So when we're designing a narrative AI,

155
00:07:18,812 --> 00:07:20,874
we wanna think about that whole sequence

156
00:07:21,355 --> 00:07:22,996
if we wanna think about the problem

157
00:07:23,337 --> 00:07:24,858
as a whole from the top down.

158
00:07:26,098 --> 00:07:33,183
So in a game, what we have is a dungeon master, an NPC,

159
00:07:34,003 --> 00:07:36,485
choices that we make, items in the world, and players.

160
00:07:37,326 --> 00:07:42,429
Might all five of these be a inspiration or a layer

161
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:45,051
or a set of layers inside an AI system?

162
00:07:45,973 --> 00:07:47,354
for designing game mechanics?

163
00:07:47,874 --> 00:07:48,694
And I think they can.

164
00:07:49,114 --> 00:07:54,075
And if we wanted to approach an AI-driven game mechanic,

165
00:07:54,155 --> 00:07:57,076
AI narrative, we'd want to think about layered AI.

166
00:07:58,756 --> 00:07:59,776
And where the player experience,

167
00:07:59,796 --> 00:08:01,297
because the player experience comes

168
00:08:01,337 --> 00:08:03,437
from these multiple layers as they move through,

169
00:08:03,457 --> 00:08:06,818
I think that the AI coordinating the effect

170
00:08:06,978 --> 00:08:09,779
of these different levels of AI is super essential

171
00:08:10,099 --> 00:08:14,300
for creating intense emotional responses on the player.

172
00:08:15,721 --> 00:08:18,824
So as a model for this, we might take the four keys,

173
00:08:18,864 --> 00:08:20,685
for example, because it's a reliable way

174
00:08:20,705 --> 00:08:22,247
of creating emotion through mechanics,

175
00:08:23,007 --> 00:08:25,750
and look at the different types of fun.

176
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:27,711
So you might have easy fun,

177
00:08:28,072 --> 00:08:29,453
I call it the bubble wrap of game design,

178
00:08:29,493 --> 00:08:30,514
just running around the world.

179
00:08:30,534 --> 00:08:32,536
You know, it's curiosity, wonder, and surprise,

180
00:08:32,576 --> 00:08:33,256
emotion-driven.

181
00:08:33,817 --> 00:08:34,958
You might have the hard fun,

182
00:08:34,978 --> 00:08:36,219
which is usually your core mechanic,

183
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:38,581
the frustration that leads to Fiero,

184
00:08:38,621 --> 00:08:39,362
the feeling of winning.

185
00:08:40,302 --> 00:08:42,624
You might also have people fun, which is a social interaction.

186
00:08:42,924 --> 00:08:49,548
Amusement naches, schadenfreude, the social interactions which make games a lot more fun.

187
00:08:49,968 --> 00:08:52,970
It's a game to play on the couch, not so much on the screen on a console game.

188
00:08:53,611 --> 00:08:54,651
And then of course serious fun.

189
00:08:54,671 --> 00:08:58,073
Well, it's like people going up to Fortnite and they're not there to play the game, they're

190
00:08:58,093 --> 00:08:59,554
just there to hang out.

191
00:08:59,634 --> 00:09:02,076
The Fortnite is the shopping mall of the current generation.

192
00:09:04,765 --> 00:09:05,606
So serious fun.

193
00:09:05,626 --> 00:09:08,349
You know, creating the desire to acquire,

194
00:09:08,369 --> 00:09:10,292
the zen-like focus, it makes winning

195
00:09:10,352 --> 00:09:12,334
feel more winning. It also makes the game

196
00:09:12,374 --> 00:09:13,896
feel less like a waste of time.

197
00:09:14,437 --> 00:09:16,179
So they're all great game mechanics, and again,

198
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:17,761
you can find out more about the four keys

199
00:09:18,662 --> 00:09:20,384
elsewhere. But for today, I really want to focus

200
00:09:20,444 --> 00:09:21,465
us back on AI.

201
00:09:23,127 --> 00:09:28,570
So for the AI, what we've got is we want to look at an AI system, AI layers, that might

202
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:32,233
generate or provide the opportunity to generate these different emotion sets.

203
00:09:32,593 --> 00:09:39,457
And I should say another thing about emotion is we can't actually generate an emotion specifically.

204
00:09:39,497 --> 00:09:41,378
I can't just, you know, hey, here's an emotion.

205
00:09:41,859 --> 00:09:45,481
But as a game designer, I could give you a little lever and say, hey, you know, as a

206
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:47,922
game designer, I say, like, hey, pull this lever and you might feel something.

207
00:09:48,623 --> 00:09:50,686
And so that's what we mean.

208
00:09:50,746 --> 00:09:53,790
So the AI could dynamically offer choices,

209
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:57,254
offer opportunities to interact in a way over time

210
00:09:57,515 --> 00:10:01,700
that then could be orchestrated along several layers

211
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:05,005
to hit a number of different emotional responses.

212
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:11,029
And then to do that, many AI approaches now

213
00:10:11,469 --> 00:10:13,771
might focus on the meta, like the Dungeon Master,

214
00:10:14,151 --> 00:10:16,752
might focus just on NPC, believable NPCs,

215
00:10:17,132 --> 00:10:20,714
might just focus on inter-player collaboration.

216
00:10:21,174 --> 00:10:23,075
But what we want is we want each layer of the AI

217
00:10:23,095 --> 00:10:23,755
to work together.

218
00:10:24,976 --> 00:10:26,537
And it kind of, my vision of this,

219
00:10:26,557 --> 00:10:29,099
and obviously this is not code,

220
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,742
but my vision is like if you have the player

221
00:10:31,762 --> 00:10:32,682
and they're very emotional,

222
00:10:32,722 --> 00:10:34,064
they're going down the path, right?

223
00:10:34,164 --> 00:10:36,405
And it encounters your AI system,

224
00:10:37,186 --> 00:10:38,587
and then that has multiple layers,

225
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,009
which have different emotional responses,

226
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:42,611
potential for different emotional responses

227
00:10:42,671 --> 00:10:44,072
coming from those layers.

228
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:49,372
It senses that the player is nearby and also the emotional state of the player,

229
00:10:50,292 --> 00:10:59,856
and in context, moves its opportunity for emotions more towards a certain direction

230
00:10:59,956 --> 00:11:02,277
that might be compatible with what the player is feeling.

231
00:11:02,577 --> 00:11:03,638
The player feels that way.

232
00:11:04,258 --> 00:11:06,699
And then a second AI might come in to that

233
00:11:07,059 --> 00:11:09,440
and then add an additional emotion

234
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:10,981
as the player moves through.

235
00:11:11,201 --> 00:11:12,182
So the player moves through,

236
00:11:12,682 --> 00:11:14,043
they might encounter another item,

237
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:15,824
have an emotional response to that,

238
00:11:16,644 --> 00:11:17,905
and then an AI could come in,

239
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,206
the AI layer could come in

240
00:11:20,586 --> 00:11:22,867
and maybe offer different opportunities

241
00:11:22,887 --> 00:11:23,668
for different emotions,

242
00:11:23,828 --> 00:11:26,349
or perhaps redirect from the candlestick

243
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:28,210
in our murder mystery, AR murder mystery,

244
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,210
to maybe the tennis shoe,

245
00:11:29,651 --> 00:11:31,551
which is the actual clue.

246
00:11:33,395 --> 00:11:37,257
And that could result in the player being more emotional

247
00:11:37,277 --> 00:11:37,817
or more happy.

248
00:11:38,937 --> 00:11:40,638
So these four patterns for layered AI

249
00:11:40,738 --> 00:11:42,959
is what I'd like to finish the talk with.

250
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,241
And so we're going to look at some films

251
00:11:46,321 --> 00:11:48,042
and talk about these different frameworks.

252
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:49,922
The first one is a frame.

253
00:11:50,903 --> 00:11:53,644
We're going to talk about making choices,

254
00:11:53,684 --> 00:11:57,546
sort of onions and layering and arcs, character arcs,

255
00:11:57,666 --> 00:12:00,007
as well as the opportunity to create emotion from items.

256
00:12:02,032 --> 00:12:03,032
So we'll talk about frames.

257
00:12:03,573 --> 00:12:05,875
I don't know how many people have really thought about

258
00:12:05,895 --> 00:12:09,098
this, but I thought there's a remarkable familiarity or

259
00:12:09,138 --> 00:12:10,879
similarity between Hunger Games and Fortnite.

260
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,982
And so what's interesting is that with the Hunger Games,

261
00:12:14,022 --> 00:12:17,785
there's actually a framework, if you know Minsky's frames.

262
00:12:19,226 --> 00:12:22,189
That frame of the movie actually tells you how to

263
00:12:22,269 --> 00:12:24,651
feel about the game.

264
00:12:25,952 --> 00:12:30,355
So if you had an AI that was filled with a number of different frames of encounters,

265
00:12:30,535 --> 00:12:36,219
you could predict the emotional response of what the player was going to feel, and dynamically

266
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:40,923
change within that frame, within that paradigm, how the player feels.

267
00:12:42,324 --> 00:12:48,568
This is, in a very simple sense, the revenge mechanic for Clash of Clans and, of course,

268
00:12:48,588 --> 00:12:49,549
the Super Bowl commercial.

269
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,712
Another game that has a very strong frame is Beat Saber.

270
00:12:52,992 --> 00:12:54,133
How many people have played Beat Saber?

271
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:58,256
And so you go in, you have lightsabers and boxes.

272
00:12:58,296 --> 00:13:00,798
You know exactly what to do because you've seen

273
00:13:00,858 --> 00:13:02,360
Star Wars episode five.

274
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,661
The scene with Vader and Luke Skywalker.

275
00:13:05,102 --> 00:13:06,683
And then you might come to mind other things.

276
00:13:06,723 --> 00:13:08,064
But that tells you how to feel.

277
00:13:08,124 --> 00:13:11,367
So a framework can add emotion to this.

278
00:13:11,387 --> 00:13:15,310
And if your AI is dynamically exchanging frames, then you

279
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:17,491
could actually create emotion over time, which is, in a

280
00:13:17,531 --> 00:13:18,152
sense, narrative.

281
00:13:19,288 --> 00:13:20,749
The second one is of course choice,

282
00:13:21,109 --> 00:13:22,470
which is what I named the talk after.

283
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:23,710
Red pill, blue pill.

284
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,011
And the interesting thing about this

285
00:13:25,111 --> 00:13:27,812
is it's not just about a choice,

286
00:13:27,912 --> 00:13:29,452
like A or B in a branching narrative.

287
00:13:29,792 --> 00:13:30,893
But if you think about what red pill

288
00:13:30,913 --> 00:13:32,293
and blue pill really means,

289
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:36,715
it's this really represents values, right?

290
00:13:36,795 --> 00:13:39,216
What are your core values?

291
00:13:40,316 --> 00:13:42,317
And the red pill is of course harsh truth

292
00:13:42,357 --> 00:13:44,218
and the blue pill is the convenient fantasy.

293
00:13:46,093 --> 00:13:48,274
What about these decisions and what about these values

294
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:49,394
could be mixed at?

295
00:13:49,554 --> 00:13:51,334
So there could be a whole layer of AI

296
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:56,636
looking at the emotional values and worldviews about,

297
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,036
maybe, how you see the world.

298
00:13:58,216 --> 00:14:00,717
Or even your capabilities could go in

299
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:03,178
to make a much richer type of choice.

300
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:10,849
Another film, Sophie's Choice, is named after the very gut-wrenching scene where she has

301
00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:13,852
to choose between one of her two children.

302
00:14:14,072 --> 00:14:16,074
Spoiler there, my apologies.

303
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:21,079
But it basically then affects everything that you do thereafter.

304
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,942
You might think of this as just, you know, you design that, you could design that as a branching

305
00:14:25,982 --> 00:14:30,243
narrative, but what if an AI had that ability to provide you with a series of these choices

306
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:34,705
dynamically as the game went through? So my murder mystery, my AR murder mystery,

307
00:14:35,065 --> 00:14:37,946
could have quite a different playthrough time and time again.

308
00:14:39,765 --> 00:14:42,906
The character's choice affects the past, the present,

309
00:14:42,946 --> 00:14:43,547
and their future.

310
00:14:43,987 --> 00:14:45,607
There's a mystery in the player's mind

311
00:14:45,627 --> 00:14:47,548
about the connections with these kinds of choices.

312
00:14:47,948 --> 00:14:49,869
And there's implied emotion around the events.

313
00:14:49,929 --> 00:14:54,370
Those would all be key traits to bake into the AI.

314
00:14:55,391 --> 00:14:56,871
And you could provide different perspectives,

315
00:14:56,891 --> 00:14:59,912
like who you play might change how

316
00:14:59,952 --> 00:15:01,553
you feel about that particular event,

317
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:03,493
if you played a different role.

318
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:09,036
And then speaking of characters, we go to the onion.

319
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:14,140
And we've got different types of choices that are revealed.

320
00:15:14,741 --> 00:15:16,662
So this is a way out of the branching narrative.

321
00:15:16,722 --> 00:15:19,204
I first thought of it when I worked on the Myst series.

322
00:15:19,284 --> 00:15:21,366
I worked on three of the Myst games back in the day.

323
00:15:21,886 --> 00:15:24,128
And they have a lovely device, especially in the first one

324
00:15:24,168 --> 00:15:26,270
of a book, where the characters are gradually revealed,

325
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:27,251
page after page.

326
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,813
And you have two brothers that you don't end up not wanting.

327
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,514
At least I don't want to help either of them,

328
00:15:31,534 --> 00:15:32,935
but you want to finish the game.

329
00:15:33,576 --> 00:15:35,177
So they create tension that way.

330
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:38,541
The players are just, those characters are pre-baked.

331
00:15:39,002 --> 00:15:42,045
You're just deciding by how much you help each one,

332
00:15:42,325 --> 00:15:43,747
how much you learn about them, and then of course,

333
00:15:43,807 --> 00:15:45,489
how much power they have in the world.

334
00:15:47,471 --> 00:15:50,014
Schindler's List has a character arc.

335
00:15:50,034 --> 00:15:51,916
Have people watched Schindler's List?

336
00:15:51,956 --> 00:15:52,898
How many people have watched?

337
00:15:52,998 --> 00:15:53,999
Okay, okay, good.

338
00:15:55,546 --> 00:15:57,227
How many people watched Sophie's Choice?

339
00:15:57,767 --> 00:15:58,548
Anyone seen Choice?

340
00:15:58,648 --> 00:15:59,748
Okay, not as many.

341
00:15:59,768 --> 00:16:00,889
All right, Schindler's List then.

342
00:16:01,249 --> 00:16:02,229
Yeah, so for Schindler's List,

343
00:16:02,249 --> 00:16:04,991
what's interesting about him is he is part of the Nazi party

344
00:16:05,011 --> 00:16:06,692
at the beginning of the film,

345
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:08,993
and then he arcs from that state

346
00:16:09,113 --> 00:16:12,455
to becoming, to hiring out, you know,

347
00:16:12,495 --> 00:16:14,115
a thousand, rescuing a thousand Jews

348
00:16:14,155 --> 00:16:16,657
from the concentration camps to work in his factory.

349
00:16:17,337 --> 00:16:19,718
So he arcs as a character, which makes the film interesting.

350
00:16:20,478 --> 00:16:23,519
Crouching Tiger's Hidden Dragon also has two character arcs,

351
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:25,400
and they're counter to each other.

352
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,781
And so the character details revealed gradually over time

353
00:16:28,801 --> 00:16:31,842
like an onion, and that their moral and their values

354
00:16:31,942 --> 00:16:33,663
and their goals are at cross purposes,

355
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,083
which makes it quite an interesting,

356
00:16:36,184 --> 00:16:38,404
much more interesting kind of journey

357
00:16:38,444 --> 00:16:39,385
for the two characters.

358
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:42,966
And then in terms of AI, there would be the character design,

359
00:16:42,986 --> 00:16:45,427
but then also the action and environment

360
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,687
could be reflect that.

361
00:16:46,727 --> 00:16:49,288
So this is a piece of a fighting scene.

362
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,912
where again, these characters are arcing.

363
00:16:54,092 --> 00:16:55,654
The two women are arcing in different directions

364
00:16:55,674 --> 00:16:56,314
than the guy is.

365
00:16:57,135 --> 00:16:59,057
And so you see that in the environment,

366
00:16:59,197 --> 00:17:01,519
it's actually, there is a bit of verbal,

367
00:17:01,539 --> 00:17:05,023
I mean, a visual play on what the characters

368
00:17:05,043 --> 00:17:05,703
are actually doing.

369
00:17:07,725 --> 00:17:09,567
So what kind of an AI system can generate that?

370
00:17:23,737 --> 00:17:26,637
Creating conflict and adversaries is a very crucial role

371
00:17:26,657 --> 00:17:27,458
for an AI as well.

372
00:17:28,098 --> 00:17:30,099
And Killmonger, and this is Black Panther,

373
00:17:30,219 --> 00:17:32,539
Killmonger and Nakia, if you think about it

374
00:17:32,939 --> 00:17:34,640
from a narrative design perspective,

375
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:37,241
they're actually the same, they have the same goals, right?

376
00:17:37,261 --> 00:17:38,281
They just have different methods

377
00:17:38,321 --> 00:17:40,022
and they've taken them to different extremes.

378
00:17:40,682 --> 00:17:42,602
I love this quote by Joe Robert Cole,

379
00:17:42,622 --> 00:17:44,403
who's the screenwriter.

380
00:17:44,423 --> 00:17:46,243
And he says, I think the best villains

381
00:17:46,383 --> 00:17:48,844
have a point of view that's relatable

382
00:17:49,204 --> 00:17:50,185
that you can empathize with.

383
00:17:50,645 --> 00:17:52,906
Right, and that's how he built the character for Killmonger.

384
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:57,007
And then it can also, but it's not necessarily,

385
00:17:57,288 --> 00:17:58,348
you share their perspective,

386
00:17:58,368 --> 00:17:59,989
but you don't exactly agree with it.

387
00:18:01,109 --> 00:18:06,011
If we go deeper into like an AI for character interaction,

388
00:18:06,131 --> 00:18:07,472
also the relationships are key.

389
00:18:07,892 --> 00:18:09,333
This is another scene from Black Panther.

390
00:18:09,373 --> 00:18:12,134
I would love to see an AI do this, create this on the fly.

391
00:18:12,714 --> 00:18:12,754
Ah!

392
00:18:12,814 --> 00:18:12,954
Ah!

393
00:18:12,974 --> 00:18:13,014
Ah!

394
00:18:13,474 --> 00:18:13,514
Ah!

395
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,722
So there's an understanding of humor, there's an understanding of the relationships of the

396
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:40,944
different characters, there's a, you know, and then how they all relate.

397
00:18:41,585 --> 00:18:44,386
That would be a really amazing experience.

398
00:18:45,627 --> 00:18:49,209
So the relationships affect the outcome of that battle in a very strong way.

399
00:18:50,832 --> 00:18:52,853
So lastly, I wanted to talk about items.

400
00:18:53,413 --> 00:18:55,375
And items can have an emotion profile,

401
00:18:55,555 --> 00:18:57,416
and they can be built into what we call an emotion

402
00:18:57,996 --> 00:19:01,358
architecture, which is the actions, the whole structure

403
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:03,320
of the way in which we interact, just

404
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,702
like your interactive architecture for your game.

405
00:19:07,886 --> 00:19:10,248
You might be able to express that with the choices

406
00:19:10,268 --> 00:19:11,249
that you offer a player.

407
00:19:11,289 --> 00:19:13,110
So here the Black Panther is being offered

408
00:19:13,451 --> 00:19:16,653
two different high-tech new Panther suits.

409
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,636
He's tempted by the gold one, but he chooses the silver,

410
00:19:19,696 --> 00:19:20,517
the more sedate one.

411
00:19:21,297 --> 00:19:23,139
Whereas, of course, the Golden Jaguar,

412
00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:25,101
his adversary, Killmonger, chooses the gold one.

413
00:19:26,221 --> 00:19:28,503
And that relates a lot to different emotions

414
00:19:28,704 --> 00:19:30,305
and their different perspectives on the world.

415
00:19:31,365 --> 00:19:35,328
In Lone Echo, which is a VR title, VR game, character

416
00:19:35,368 --> 00:19:38,431
details are revealed gradually through the use of items.

417
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:41,713
So you see different items that you can pick up and find

418
00:19:41,873 --> 00:19:42,474
out a story.

419
00:19:42,874 --> 00:19:44,896
So again, this is almost like an onion where you're just

420
00:19:45,316 --> 00:19:47,438
finding more about people.

421
00:19:47,618 --> 00:19:48,479
It's already pre-baked.

422
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:51,400
but you can get more into them,

423
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,200
and you can also skip the story if you want to.

424
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,541
But what would it take for an AI,

425
00:19:55,581 --> 00:19:57,422
not just to leave around power-ups,

426
00:19:57,522 --> 00:20:00,642
but to create items that were particularly meaningful

427
00:20:00,682 --> 00:20:03,043
and significant and worked with that particular character?

428
00:20:05,184 --> 00:20:06,564
A story AI might also,

429
00:20:06,624 --> 00:20:09,045
and this is something that we're experimenting with at Xeo,

430
00:20:09,265 --> 00:20:11,566
also use props to tell part of the story.

431
00:20:12,386 --> 00:20:13,366
This is Shape of Water.

432
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:15,047
How many people have seen that?

433
00:20:15,267 --> 00:20:16,267
Okay, good.

434
00:20:17,123 --> 00:20:18,645
It's a, yeah, so it's a very fascinating,

435
00:20:18,845 --> 00:20:20,508
she's a princess that has no voice.

436
00:20:20,808 --> 00:20:23,592
She's a cleaner in a secret lab.

437
00:20:24,753 --> 00:20:28,759
And the props that she uses, the visual items in the world

438
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,983
are amazing storytelling tools.

439
00:20:32,543 --> 00:20:36,105
They actually change the story as you move over time.

440
00:20:36,185 --> 00:20:37,586
It's a lot of it is told visually.

441
00:20:38,066 --> 00:20:41,208
And so that's another way of not having a lot of narrative.

442
00:20:41,528 --> 00:20:44,849
And if there were really deep semantic understanding

443
00:20:45,209 --> 00:20:48,451
of items in the AI, and then certainly for AR,

444
00:20:48,471 --> 00:20:51,392
a deep ability to recognize objects

445
00:20:51,452 --> 00:20:53,493
and understand not only the object,

446
00:20:53,513 --> 00:20:55,414
like this is a microphone or that's a tennis shoe

447
00:20:55,494 --> 00:20:56,955
or that's a bottle of soda,

448
00:20:57,375 --> 00:21:00,616
but what is the semantic meaning of it?

449
00:21:03,469 --> 00:21:06,158
And most of us have probably felt something about an object,

450
00:21:06,338 --> 00:21:07,682
like this is the companion cube.

451
00:21:07,983 --> 00:21:10,070
Yeah, any portal fans out there?

452
00:21:11,268 --> 00:21:15,130
And so AR, as I've said, semantic recognition and use

453
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,851
is going to be very, very crucial.

454
00:21:16,891 --> 00:21:20,473
Because if I want my murder mystery in AR, in my living

455
00:21:20,513 --> 00:21:23,655
room, it's going to be much more fun if there are,

456
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,536
in addition to virtual props, they're actually

457
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:26,516
using the real props.

458
00:21:27,016 --> 00:21:29,978
And it is going to need to know from us, from our play styles,

459
00:21:30,018 --> 00:21:32,279
understand us as players, whether it's more interesting

460
00:21:32,339 --> 00:21:36,121
to hide the clue under the coffee table or under the

461
00:21:36,321 --> 00:21:36,441
chair.

462
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:46,027
And then we've got AI understanding the room around you, so we're playing with that.

463
00:21:46,067 --> 00:21:47,669
This is a Latin scale of wonders.

464
00:21:49,888 --> 00:21:53,910
And that's really, again, going to be really crucial for understanding AR.

465
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:56,691
I mean, understanding the world for AR.

466
00:21:57,192 --> 00:22:01,194
So just imagine, to wrap up, let's reimagine, you know, say, God of War,

467
00:22:01,234 --> 00:22:05,176
which is a very emotional, very wonderful, wonderful, wonderful game,

468
00:22:06,456 --> 00:22:08,978
is what sort of frames does it bring, right?

469
00:22:09,338 --> 00:22:11,879
So this is, you know, clearly a combat frame.

470
00:22:12,259 --> 00:22:15,281
And the fact that it breaks a lot of the frames for the franchise

471
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:17,282
created a lot of interest in the game.

472
00:22:17,422 --> 00:22:17,822
And I think it's...

473
00:22:19,511 --> 00:22:21,952
is a big part of why it was such a success.

474
00:22:23,433 --> 00:22:26,195
The frames that you're exploring in the game,

475
00:22:26,215 --> 00:22:28,196
you explore puzzles and you explore,

476
00:22:28,216 --> 00:22:29,516
there's an RPG element as well,

477
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:31,417
but maybe we can explore relationships

478
00:22:31,497 --> 00:22:32,698
and items in more detail

479
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:34,439
if we were going to frame it with more AI.

480
00:22:36,323 --> 00:22:38,404
You obviously have choices about things to protect.

481
00:22:38,905 --> 00:22:42,127
And so that creates a lot of social emotions.

482
00:22:42,247 --> 00:22:45,769
But then why not complicate things and then

483
00:22:45,849 --> 00:22:48,491
have more interesting relationships

484
00:22:48,551 --> 00:22:50,072
between the different characters?

485
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:52,474
So now you have to make some more interesting choices.

486
00:22:54,275 --> 00:22:55,916
What kind of character onions would be,

487
00:22:56,096 --> 00:23:00,379
what could you do dynamically to create these characters

488
00:23:00,439 --> 00:23:01,420
as they arc over time?

489
00:23:03,189 --> 00:23:07,411
Most of the AI here is pre-built in, in terms of what they're going to do, the script, it

490
00:23:07,772 --> 00:23:08,772
has a standard structure.

491
00:23:09,673 --> 00:23:12,534
But if we had something that was more dynamic, what could happen?

492
00:23:13,715 --> 00:23:17,757
And I think what we're going to do is, we're going to win in this, is a narrative AI that

493
00:23:17,797 --> 00:23:22,980
could create something as compelling as the pyre scene, gathering his wife's ashes in

494
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,922
God of War, but dynamically, without any human intervention.

495
00:23:29,468 --> 00:23:30,269
So that's it.

496
00:23:30,289 --> 00:23:33,571
Those are the four frames for narrative AI.

497
00:23:34,612 --> 00:23:36,393
Frames, they do a lot of the work for you

498
00:23:36,714 --> 00:23:39,295
because by association, you're automatically bringing

499
00:23:39,315 --> 00:23:41,077
a lot to the table as a player.

500
00:23:41,677 --> 00:23:44,179
A lot of emotions are going to come from association.

501
00:23:44,699 --> 00:23:46,640
Your choice, you're going to engage your belief systems

502
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,882
of players through their system,

503
00:23:49,022 --> 00:23:50,343
through their philosophy, their worldview.

504
00:23:50,983 --> 00:23:53,745
Onions and arcs will either deepen your relationship

505
00:23:53,885 --> 00:23:55,547
or arc your characters over time.

506
00:23:56,567 --> 00:23:59,668
And items will all add in layers of emotional resonance

507
00:23:59,708 --> 00:24:01,968
and meaning, as well as bonuses and stats.

508
00:24:03,729 --> 00:24:05,309
So we've got the idea of layered AI,

509
00:24:05,349 --> 00:24:08,130
but then a word of caution is we can also do sentiment analysis.

510
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:13,411
And as we've done with social media, for better or worse,

511
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:15,151
there's some really great opportunities

512
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:18,132
to create really compelling player engagement

513
00:24:18,532 --> 00:24:21,193
from sentiment analysis of chat or utterances,

514
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:23,053
or some of the, obviously, we could

515
00:24:23,073 --> 00:24:24,693
measure emotional people's faces as well.

516
00:24:25,694 --> 00:24:27,515
So thank you very much, thank you for your time.

517
00:24:27,535 --> 00:24:40,542
Do we have time for questions?

518
00:24:46,505 --> 00:24:47,025
Any questions?

519
00:24:53,095 --> 00:25:02,399
So I was curious, there is a Paradox Games Crusader Kings which is known for ability to generate a lot of stories to AI.

520
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:09,202
So have you used it in your research and how does it fit in your scheme?

521
00:25:11,728 --> 00:25:13,630
So could you say the beginning of the question?

522
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:18,875
The game Crusader Kings is able to generate a lot of stories like true to eye.

523
00:25:18,935 --> 00:25:22,979
Have you used it as an example? How does it fit in this game?

524
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:27,003
Yeah, we haven't done a specific study on that one, unfortunately.

525
00:25:27,023 --> 00:25:30,367
Yeah. On that particular title.

526
00:25:33,095 --> 00:25:37,123
Sorry, it's just like, it's one of the games which is like,

527
00:25:37,483 --> 00:25:40,629
has a central feature,

528
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:42,653
there's an ability to generate stories.

529
00:25:44,249 --> 00:25:45,590
Yeah, so what we want to look at is the,

530
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:47,991
so there's an interesting point in terms of stories,

531
00:25:48,192 --> 00:25:52,074
is do we take it from the, I think a first step,

532
00:25:52,794 --> 00:25:56,757
in addition, instead of trying to create a story generator,

533
00:25:57,157 --> 00:25:59,339
would be to create a moment-to-moment generator,

534
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:02,160
because if you think about the birds and the planes

535
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,623
for a moment, is that the reason why a story might move us

536
00:26:06,243 --> 00:26:09,865
is that it is from our, it is its ability

537
00:26:09,965 --> 00:26:11,346
to move us emotionally.

538
00:26:12,247 --> 00:26:15,067
And so if we, and that's, all of the techniques

539
00:26:15,108 --> 00:26:18,909
from character, from three act structure

540
00:26:19,029 --> 00:26:21,770
and that sort of thing are all about designing ways

541
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:23,650
of creating emotions.

542
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:26,031
And so if we look from the game design,

543
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:28,832
we're gonna actually be able to do more than stories do

544
00:26:29,512 --> 00:26:31,933
by looking at, by being able to trigger emotions

545
00:26:32,233 --> 00:26:34,634
in our own unique ways, as well as, you know,

546
00:26:34,934 --> 00:26:36,414
with more traditional story arcs.

547
00:26:37,514 --> 00:26:38,035
Yeah, thank you.

548
00:26:40,406 --> 00:26:42,368
Hi, first of all, great talk.

549
00:26:42,528 --> 00:26:43,669
Thanks for coming out.

550
00:26:43,909 --> 00:26:46,772
So I'm familiar with games like Gone Home and Tacoma,

551
00:26:46,852 --> 00:26:49,014
where the stories are very linearly driven,

552
00:26:49,054 --> 00:26:51,096
but you're interacting with environmental objects

553
00:26:51,156 --> 00:26:52,998
to build that kind of core narrative.

554
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:56,101
And that kind of reminded me of a lot of the onion arcs

555
00:26:56,121 --> 00:26:57,522
that you were talking about during your talk

556
00:26:57,542 --> 00:26:58,783
about peeling those layers back.

557
00:26:58,844 --> 00:27:02,067
So I was wondering how we could integrate generative AI

558
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:04,129
and that kind of deep level of thinking to

559
00:27:05,229 --> 00:27:07,911
kind of pre-populate worlds with those narrative aspects

560
00:27:07,951 --> 00:27:10,612
to drive maybe a linear and even a more dynamic

561
00:27:11,352 --> 00:27:11,973
narrative story.

562
00:27:12,633 --> 00:27:14,754
Yeah, well I think that what we're exploring

563
00:27:15,094 --> 00:27:17,935
is we're looking at, say, a room like in

564
00:27:17,995 --> 00:27:19,976
Follow the White Rabbit, it starts in Paris,

565
00:27:20,036 --> 00:27:22,177
you know, a cafe in Paris, and it's about a magician

566
00:27:22,198 --> 00:27:23,918
who's been a charlatan like all his life

567
00:27:23,958 --> 00:27:25,159
until one day the magic actually works.

568
00:27:26,282 --> 00:27:28,644
So we start with some as reference,

569
00:27:28,945 --> 00:27:31,908
some planned out ways in which you get out,

570
00:27:31,928 --> 00:27:32,629
it's an escape room,

571
00:27:32,649 --> 00:27:34,071
so ways that you would get out of the room

572
00:27:34,251 --> 00:27:36,794
and then narrative arcs that would get you there.

573
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:39,858
And then to break that up into more

574
00:27:39,918 --> 00:27:41,600
the micro moment to moment,

575
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:45,404
and then a micro moment to moment system.

576
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:48,948
so that players could, in a sense, sort of mix and match

577
00:27:48,988 --> 00:27:50,530
their way out of it.

578
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:54,173
There is a feeling, a tension that I feel in games that have

579
00:27:54,213 --> 00:27:57,415
a very strong narrative where I'm trying to second guess the

580
00:27:57,455 --> 00:28:02,239
designer, whereas in like a murder mystery, when I have a

581
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:05,421
murder mystery dinner at home with my friends, we can be much

582
00:28:05,481 --> 00:28:06,262
more freeform.

583
00:28:06,562 --> 00:28:07,963
And we're trusting that there's going to be something

584
00:28:08,023 --> 00:28:11,246
interesting around the next corner, but not that we have

585
00:28:11,286 --> 00:28:13,448
to finish the maze in the same way each time.

586
00:28:14,856 --> 00:28:18,420
So I don't think that we have language to describe these other patterns,

587
00:28:19,101 --> 00:28:23,565
but every time we bring something in from film, I think there's an opportunity to use it, to leverage it,

588
00:28:23,685 --> 00:28:25,367
and then there's also an opportunity to break it.

589
00:28:25,827 --> 00:28:31,493
So I try and have both of those design sessions to make it much more rich.

590
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:35,457
And again, we're just getting started, so I'm really looking forward to what people come up with.

591
00:28:35,758 --> 00:28:36,438
Awesome, thank you.

592
00:28:36,478 --> 00:28:36,698
Thank you.

593
00:28:39,361 --> 00:28:44,070
Which of the devices to create emotions that you described were the most fruitful?

594
00:28:44,211 --> 00:28:51,304
Which one, if you only had to use one, which one gives the biggest bang for your buck for amount of effort?

595
00:28:52,098 --> 00:28:56,099
Well, the most effortless one would be the one I started with, would be frames, because

596
00:28:56,539 --> 00:28:57,760
frames are also icons.

597
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,380
I talk a lot in my other talks about iconic design.

598
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,961
If you use something that has an emotional resonance, you instantly get it.

599
00:29:04,941 --> 00:29:09,622
Disney in their line design will often do that, so like the old Pirates of the Caribbean,

600
00:29:09,863 --> 00:29:14,424
new Pirates a little bit, but as you're waiting for, and then as you get on these dark rides,

601
00:29:14,824 --> 00:29:18,444
you're hit with, you know, here's a pirate, here's a pirate chasing a lady, here's a lady

602
00:29:18,484 --> 00:29:19,225
chasing a pirate.

603
00:29:19,505 --> 00:29:21,585
They're taking all these memes, all these tropes.

604
00:29:22,185 --> 00:29:23,546
And that is fairly easy.

605
00:29:23,566 --> 00:29:26,629
If you had a library of those, you could put those

606
00:29:26,769 --> 00:29:28,450
into the player thing.

607
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:30,952
But I think the second easiest one would, of course, be

608
00:29:31,052 --> 00:29:33,594
onions, where it's a character arc that's already built.

609
00:29:34,835 --> 00:29:38,137
And you might be able to have three or four different

610
00:29:38,237 --> 00:29:41,259
onions, and being able to shuffle those decks.

611
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,121
and you would have some very interesting characters

612
00:29:44,161 --> 00:29:45,141
that change over time.

613
00:29:46,302 --> 00:29:48,583
And that would be a very, much easier

614
00:29:48,603 --> 00:29:52,985
than trying to recognize the difference between a dollar

615
00:29:53,025 --> 00:29:54,726
bill and this box of water.

616
00:29:55,986 --> 00:29:56,247
Thank you.

617
00:29:56,427 --> 00:29:56,747
Thank you.

618
00:29:58,408 --> 00:29:59,948
OK, I think we're just at time.

619
00:30:00,229 --> 00:30:01,229
So thank you.

620
00:30:01,249 --> 00:30:03,370
But if you want to, I'll be here in the back, I guess,

621
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:05,371
after there's a speaker thing.

622
00:30:05,891 --> 00:30:08,332
Thanks very much for having me here.

623
00:30:08,352 --> 00:30:08,893
All right.

624
00:30:09,053 --> 00:30:10,333
I look forward to making what you all get.
