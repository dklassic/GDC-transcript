1
00:00:12,644 --> 00:00:14,665
I am Teddy Deif, sometimes.

2
00:00:15,605 --> 00:00:27,110
Teddy Deif is the director, co-writer, and lead singer of the OFK project, co-designer of Hyper Light Drifter, co-founder of LA Indie Games Collective Glitch City, and someone on Twitter who you may follow or have muted.

3
00:00:28,311 --> 00:00:30,452
Sometimes I am my legal name.

4
00:00:31,206 --> 00:00:31,866
They live in LA.

5
00:00:32,207 --> 00:00:32,987
They lease a car.

6
00:00:33,247 --> 00:00:35,849
They need to cancel their Disney Plus subscription.

7
00:00:36,649 --> 00:00:42,572
They try very hard to get a good table when seated at restaurants because their grandmother taught them it was important for being a good host when dining out.

8
00:00:43,593 --> 00:00:46,774
But with my close friends, I'm just me, whoever that is.

9
00:00:47,595 --> 00:00:49,396
And I'm all those other things unfiltered.

10
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:52,958
I'm going to do my best this morning to speak to you without filter.

11
00:00:54,312 --> 00:00:56,393
This talk is all about persona filters.

12
00:00:56,693 --> 00:01:02,117
You might know them better as virtual identities, VTubers, virtual bands, or gorillas.

13
00:01:04,098 --> 00:01:04,878
Let's step back for a second.

14
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:05,098
Hi.

15
00:01:05,518 --> 00:01:07,800
I'm up here because I run the OFK project.

16
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,862
And for those of you who are not familiar, I will now pitch our video game because that is my job.

17
00:01:12,643 --> 00:01:18,086
We Are OFK is a virtual band with an interactive TV series that tells their origin story.

18
00:01:18,606 --> 00:01:23,349
It's a heartfelt, vulnerable portrayal of what it costs to make art and what thrives for it.

19
00:01:24,192 --> 00:01:32,237
The virtual band are kinda like Gorillaz or KDA, but OFK's band characters are indie, not pop stars, just trying to make it happen like other artists.

20
00:01:33,578 --> 00:01:34,339
Let's watch the trailer!

21
00:01:42,624 --> 00:01:48,708
Help me up, tear me down Come apart, come around

22
00:01:50,839 --> 00:01:52,300
I miss my life, Carter.

23
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,141
I take a piece of me that hurts

24
00:02:21,064 --> 00:02:21,624
I threw it away.

25
00:02:24,785 --> 00:02:38,350
Who's to say what will last?

26
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:42,831
I thought you had integrity.

27
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,552
I'm so jealous, man.

28
00:02:44,952 --> 00:02:47,813
To be able to just do the thing you want to be doing.

29
00:03:05,554 --> 00:03:05,676
um...

30
00:03:06,621 --> 00:03:08,222
Yeah, five years, there it is.

31
00:03:08,963 --> 00:03:09,403
Here they are.

32
00:03:09,463 --> 00:03:19,350
This is the band Clockwise producer Jay Zhang, keyboardist Itsumi Saito, vocalist Luca Le Fay, visual artist Carter Flores, and hologram audio plugin Debug the Cat.

33
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:24,573
OFK are based in Los Angeles, where they played their first show on stage at the Game Awards in 2020.

34
00:03:24,873 --> 00:03:29,596
We released our game and EP last fall on Switch, PlayStation, PC.

35
00:03:30,217 --> 00:03:32,819
We released a holiday song and music video in December.

36
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:36,361
And just last month, we played our first fully live show in LA.

37
00:03:37,882 --> 00:03:40,283
I play Luca Le Fay in the game and in our music.

38
00:03:40,604 --> 00:03:43,085
I act as him in the game, I sing as him in our music.

39
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:49,869
Basically, I'm speaking on this topic today because I've been leading a team that's building and operating virtual identities now for five years.

40
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:53,051
I'm going to try to impart what I've learned about virtual identities.

41
00:03:53,392 --> 00:03:56,854
Their history, how they're created, how they live and die.

42
00:03:57,494 --> 00:04:01,697
If there's a character you're considering bringing into virtual existence, consider how they resonate with you.

43
00:04:02,421 --> 00:04:07,024
what from my experience you'd emulate, what you'd do differently, what excites you, and what scares you.

44
00:04:07,804 --> 00:04:09,345
Bring that to the Q&A at the end, please.

45
00:04:11,366 --> 00:04:13,527
Part one, a brief history of virtual identity.

46
00:04:13,727 --> 00:04:14,107
Let's go.

47
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:18,290
So you are already familiar with a lot of virtual identities, probably more than you realize.

48
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:22,032
You probably know gorillas, which is gorillas, not the gorillas, which

49
00:04:24,178 --> 00:04:24,558
My life.

50
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:27,981
A lot of people mistakenly think of them as the first virtual band.

51
00:04:28,461 --> 00:04:36,387
They were created in 1998 by artist Jamie Hewlett, known for his comic Tank Girl, and rock star Damon Albarn, who had risen to fame with his band Blur.

52
00:04:37,008 --> 00:04:42,732
Girl has released their first album in 2001 with a series of animated music videos that introduced the virtual band.

53
00:04:43,925 --> 00:04:51,970
I find gorillas really interesting because at first for live shows, they hid themselves behind a screen and then animated video projections of the characters played in front.

54
00:04:52,571 --> 00:04:55,993
They did this even though their creators were already famous and obviously not a secret.

55
00:04:57,514 --> 00:05:03,678
But as the years went on, they've transitioned to letting the musicians be out in front as themselves, less committed to the illusion during live shows.

56
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:08,461
That flexible relationship between artists and virtual identity fascinates me.

57
00:05:08,761 --> 00:05:11,023
And I'll explain why in this talk.

58
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:20,429
You probably also know KDA, created by Riot Games in 2018, and composed of four characters from their game, League of Legends, re-skinned as a pop group.

59
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:29,614
From a business perspective, KDA was created to get Riot more involved in music, to promote League, and to sell League skins, but of course the band has a huge fan base of its own.

60
00:05:30,615 --> 00:05:35,458
They're a notable contrast to Gorillaz in that the performers do not own the virtual identities that they perform as.

61
00:05:35,998 --> 00:05:41,461
Kind of as a result of that, to date at least on US streaming platforms, KDA have released just six songs.

62
00:05:43,548 --> 00:05:49,312
But if you're interested in creating virtual identity, there are so many points of reference beyond these big current ones.

63
00:05:49,812 --> 00:05:54,876
The more you think of virtual identity as the broad and unexplored space it is, the richer of a history you'll find.

64
00:05:56,597 --> 00:05:59,019
To set the stage, I would describe virtual identity as this.

65
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:07,526
A fictional character presented as if they exist in our reality, operated by a person or persons who have their own separate identities.

66
00:06:08,796 --> 00:06:09,657
Here are some of my favorites.

67
00:06:09,757 --> 00:06:15,582
So this is a starter pack of the lineage of virtual celebrity across television, music, and the internet.

68
00:06:17,023 --> 00:06:17,884
Alvin and the Chipmunks, 1958.

69
00:06:18,564 --> 00:06:19,946
Yeah, right?

70
00:06:20,926 --> 00:06:29,353
A trio of animated chipmunks first created for a children's song in which the creator, Ross Bagdasarian, pitch shifted his voice to sound like tiny, cute chipmunks.

71
00:06:30,054 --> 00:06:31,495
They actually started with just a song.

72
00:06:31,996 --> 00:06:33,557
And then the following year, they got a comic.

73
00:06:33,917 --> 00:06:37,999
which was then developed into a TV series that ran for one season and was cancelled.

74
00:06:38,679 --> 00:06:43,261
Then their original creator and voice died, but the chipmunks did not.

75
00:06:44,221 --> 00:06:50,403
They were resurrected in the early 80s for a new TV series, which is probably the one that you know, if you know them, that ran for eight seasons.

76
00:06:51,404 --> 00:06:54,925
So today they are zombie chipmunks with a dead creator and they have five Grammys.

77
00:06:56,838 --> 00:07:04,563
In 1966, The Monkees, which by the way has got to be a reference to, or Gorillaz has to be a reference to The Monkees, and I would love to ask them.

78
00:07:05,244 --> 00:07:09,506
This one is really weird, and it's my personal favorite point of reference for OFK.

79
00:07:10,107 --> 00:07:14,570
The Monkees were a band created in conjunction with a TV show, much like OFK.

80
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:23,536
They were developed by an aspiring filmmaker, Bob Raffleson, who pitched the music and the series to Columbia Records and their TV division, respectively.

81
00:07:24,471 --> 00:07:28,636
Musically, they were meant to be kind of America's answer to the Beatles, and in a way they were.

82
00:07:28,716 --> 00:07:30,138
They were very, very popular.

83
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:34,684
They only lasted a few years as a group, but they did well for themselves.

84
00:07:35,424 --> 00:07:41,665
They are, of course, they're not animated characters, and the band members go by their real names, but the Monkees started as fictional.

85
00:07:41,925 --> 00:07:44,766
They were assembled by a casting call for actors and musicians.

86
00:07:45,426 --> 00:07:51,047
Everything that they said and sang on TV was written for them and fiction, but they seem to exist in the real world.

87
00:07:51,527 --> 00:07:54,548
And in fact, the Monkees released albums and played concerts like any other band.

88
00:07:55,348 --> 00:08:04,790
What's really fascinating about this one is that at first, the band members were so busy filming the TV show and doing press and stuff that they were kept out of the music and writing

89
00:08:05,632 --> 00:08:06,532
and recording process.

90
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:16,815
There was a lot of interesting public backlash and power struggle because of that, and the Monkees eventually took control of their own music, narrowing the gap between their ritual identities and their real ones.

91
00:08:17,815 --> 00:08:29,578
What makes this especially interesting to me is that most of their peers at the time, including the Beatles, used session musicians for recordings, so the line of how one-to-one any musician is to their band identity is already blurry.

92
00:08:32,141 --> 00:08:34,382
1994, Space Ghost, another virtual identity.

93
00:08:34,842 --> 00:08:43,048
Cartoon Network transformed Space Ghost, a superhero from a 1966 cartoon, into a talk show host in a show called Space Ghost Coast to Coast.

94
00:08:44,189 --> 00:08:50,833
It was a spoof on talk shows, kind of a precursor to things like Zach Galifianakis' Between Two Ferns or the Eric Andre Show.

95
00:08:51,914 --> 00:08:57,638
Space Ghost was depicted using animation cells from the original show combined with video of real people that he would interview.

96
00:08:58,467 --> 00:09:05,432
Space Ghost didn't really step out of his world into theirs, and his guests were mostly transported to his show.

97
00:09:05,972 --> 00:09:08,934
But you know he'd be like a VTuber or something if they'd done this today.

98
00:09:10,355 --> 00:09:15,358
Interestingly, they also released music by Space Ghost, which is a great band name.

99
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:17,459
2007, Hatsune Miku.

100
00:09:17,739 --> 00:09:24,564
So Miku is firstly a Vocaloid software voice bank, which means she's a virtual instrument that's created to simulate a human voice.

101
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,942
that anyone can buy and use for their own music.

102
00:09:27,702 --> 00:09:33,708
The sound was designed based on the voice of Japanese voice actor Saki Fujita, but she has no formal attachment or ownership of it.

103
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:42,339
I watched Miku perform live back in 2016, one month after we released Hyper Light Drifter, and she gave me the first idea for OFK.

104
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:52,186
I saw this huge theater of people who were absolutely invested in a virtual idol and wanted to see something with that imagination on a more intimate scale, something more flawed.

105
00:09:52,707 --> 00:09:56,729
I wanted a virtual musician who would be making music in their bedroom, like a fan of Miku.

106
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:00,472
Miku is the most fully fictional on this list, in my opinion.

107
00:10:00,652 --> 00:10:01,993
Her voice is computer generated.

108
00:10:02,403 --> 00:10:07,405
She's owned by a large company, so it's hard to draw any direct links to humans creatively involved in her identity.

109
00:10:08,126 --> 00:10:08,406
Bless you.

110
00:10:09,326 --> 00:10:12,368
This isn't inherently bad, but it is tricky, and I'll get to it later.

111
00:10:15,377 --> 00:10:16,077
2017 CodeMiko.

112
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:19,258
Miko's a VTuber, Twitch streamer, and one of the biggest.

113
00:10:20,438 --> 00:10:25,139
She's voiced and engineered by a real person, Yuna Kang, who uses a motion capture rig to stream.

114
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:32,880
I find this example interesting because, from the beginning, she has made her real self visible on streams, calling herself the Technician.

115
00:10:33,701 --> 00:10:37,701
She mostly interviews other streamers, sometimes plays games, sometimes does tech demos.

116
00:10:38,201 --> 00:10:41,202
She's at the forefront of this huge growth on Twitch of VTubers.

117
00:10:42,193 --> 00:10:46,418
and she has spoken about how hard the project has been on her mental health, which is another thing I'll get to later.

118
00:10:50,403 --> 00:10:51,704
You can always shout when I'm drinking water.

119
00:10:52,887 --> 00:10:53,267
or I'll show.

120
00:10:54,529 --> 00:11:00,294
Beyond media examples, I encourage you to think about how we all have experience constructing our identities for the consumption of others.

121
00:11:01,935 --> 00:11:15,427
Obviously, there's an important line between yourself and a fictional character, but social media does only show a sliver of your real personality, and most of us give some thought to what parts of ourselves we let visible online, or even what we let visible at, for example, this conference.

122
00:11:16,648 --> 00:11:19,351
That's a stretch of the notion of virtual identity, but it is connected.

123
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:26,369
That's enough of me nerding out about virtual characters, so let's get into me nerding out about creating virtual characters.

124
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:33,794
Before it was set to be a virtual band, OFK was simply going to be a story, set in LA, of indie artists trying to make something.

125
00:11:34,474 --> 00:11:39,338
So I knew from the start that I wanted it to feel small and honest, vulnerable, intimate.

126
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:48,028
As a game, our goal with We Are OFK was to make a game experience that would welcome any fan of the music to experience the band in a deeper interactive way.

127
00:11:48,788 --> 00:11:54,950
But in designing the characters we knew would become virtual, we developed our pillars from what we wanted to avoid from references.

128
00:11:56,511 --> 00:11:57,771
With KDA, too big.

129
00:11:58,212 --> 00:11:59,852
We didn't want to pretend we were pop stars.

130
00:11:59,972 --> 00:12:01,533
We'd be new to this audience.

131
00:12:01,693 --> 00:12:03,553
And personally, I'm new to singing and pop music.

132
00:12:04,054 --> 00:12:07,575
So our characters would not be huge, famous, overtly glamorous like KDA.

133
00:12:08,558 --> 00:12:09,719
Gorillas, too, fantasy.

134
00:12:09,859 --> 00:12:11,541
We wanted to be relatable and genuine.

135
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:18,447
And while it's tempting to go supernatural with a virtual character who can be anything, we wanted our characters to be human and feel honest.

136
00:12:19,288 --> 00:12:27,376
Gorillas feel honest to their creator's worldview, but they exist in a totally different reality by nature in that they are talking gorillas.

137
00:12:31,377 --> 00:12:32,898
It's gotta be a reference to the monkeys.

138
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,459
And Miku's too disconnected.

139
00:12:35,499 --> 00:12:38,701
We wanted our characters' identities and backgrounds to relate to their creators.

140
00:12:39,521 --> 00:12:44,384
Not one-to-one, no member of OFK is exactly one member of our team, even my character.

141
00:12:44,784 --> 00:12:47,246
And the stories are fictional, though inspired by our lives.

142
00:12:48,106 --> 00:12:51,068
But we wanted to be honest, and that meant writing from personal experience.

143
00:12:51,888 --> 00:12:56,150
Miku and KDA feel strategically assembled, owned by a big company.

144
00:12:56,811 --> 00:12:58,912
We're small, and we wanted to take advantage of that.

145
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:04,452
Also, the bigger your organization gets, the more pitfalls around representation and proper crediting.

146
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:08,334
Before I dig into that, let's step forward into how we actually made all this.

147
00:13:09,895 --> 00:13:10,475
Character design.

148
00:13:10,495 --> 00:13:20,460
We wanted something that matched Jenny Yu's art style, the art director, with strong, straight lines, curved edges, not realistic, not overtly anime, not cartoony.

149
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:28,684
We worked with our character designer, Nafisa Tang, to develop personal styles for each character that expressed their character.

150
00:13:29,963 --> 00:13:33,606
that came across as iconic, but not so high fashion that they were beyond relatable.

151
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,568
Although they are, like, way stylish.

152
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:47,677
Then for turning them into 3D models, Jenny and Efisa worked closely with our technical art director, Chelsea Hash, for a while to create beautiful models that matched style from all angles and handled lighting right.

153
00:13:49,299 --> 00:13:54,663
We knew we'd need beautiful models, not just for the game, but for hopefully the existence of the virtual characters for a long time to come.

154
00:13:55,384 --> 00:13:57,005
So we felt the extra scrutiny was worth it.

155
00:13:59,059 --> 00:13:59,479
MoCap.

156
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:12,432
So our animators, Taylor Reynolds and Devon Beasley, created all the animations for the game itself, but we needed a MoCap motion capture setup to operate the 3D characters for live performance.

157
00:14:13,212 --> 00:14:14,974
We contracted a company called PolyWink.

158
00:14:16,115 --> 00:14:20,920
They create the 52 blend shapes you need for the iPhone X facial MoCap if you've used Animoji

159
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,381
you've used this system.

160
00:14:23,642 --> 00:14:30,086
You upload your model and for like $300 per model, their turnaround time is like one day and they return it to you.

161
00:14:30,126 --> 00:14:30,687
It's incredible.

162
00:14:32,828 --> 00:14:39,112
So I made a clone of our main Unity project and I hacked away what I didn't need to build a bare bones project for Luca to stream from.

163
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:50,000
I used the ARKit Foundations Unity plugin to connect the iPhone to ARKit and then connected it to some head IK that I'd set up so that it works with the upper body.

164
00:14:51,345 --> 00:14:57,407
And then I just run this in tandem with a companion app on my phone, which is installed by the plugin, and that's it.

165
00:14:58,187 --> 00:15:04,988
So when you see me running mocap in some examples, that's just common streaming software, OBS, that is screen capturing my Unity window.

166
00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:12,530
I'm about to invest in a full body mocap suit for live music shows, so pray for me and the tech setup for that, please.

167
00:15:16,271 --> 00:15:17,291
So, okay, operating it.

168
00:15:17,531 --> 00:15:18,632
Let's dig into the weird stuff.

169
00:15:18,652 --> 00:15:20,412
Let's talk about being a virtual character.

170
00:15:22,928 --> 00:15:25,670
I use this mocap setup for all kinds of appearances outside the game.

171
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:28,813
Twitch streams, guest appearances, and now live music.

172
00:15:30,014 --> 00:15:35,698
About a year before release, I soft-launched the character by starting semi-regular Twitch streams.

173
00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:38,280
I played games, I sang songs, or just chatted.

174
00:15:38,561 --> 00:15:39,321
Here's a quick clip.

175
00:15:40,582 --> 00:15:41,723
Hey, this game is so thoughtful.

176
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:42,384
Hey, cat.

177
00:15:42,444 --> 00:15:42,764
Yeah.

178
00:15:43,745 --> 00:15:44,405
I pet the cat.

179
00:15:44,665 --> 00:15:45,686
It's very relaxed with me.

180
00:15:46,887 --> 00:15:48,569
Oh, the cat gives me HP.

181
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:49,970
The cat is the save point.

182
00:15:51,104 --> 00:15:58,209
Beyond live appearances, pre-recording the mocap became really useful for marketing opportunities where we didn't have the budget to create new animation.

183
00:16:15,054 --> 00:16:26,988
So, for example, when Dreams PS4's Impy Awards asked us to judge Song of the Year, I convinced them to let us say that OFK were judging the award, and then Luka sent in, like, a greeting message for their broadcast.

184
00:16:27,509 --> 00:16:32,695
Or, when we got some upsetting early feedback from the game, we needed to post an important disclaimer message very quickly.

185
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:35,739
Hi, it's me, Luca.

186
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,421
We hope you enjoyed episode one of We Are OFK.

187
00:16:39,061 --> 00:16:41,562
Itsu asked me to read off a few disclaimers here before we move on.

188
00:16:42,222 --> 00:16:44,123
Shoes in the house.

189
00:16:46,084 --> 00:16:53,067
We know that there are several scenes in this series depicting us wearing shoes inside, even on a bed.

190
00:16:53,807 --> 00:16:55,228
You may wear shoes in your house.

191
00:16:55,868 --> 00:16:56,148
We don't.

192
00:16:57,049 --> 00:17:01,210
And again, this is just a technical limitation of recreating our story in a video game.

193
00:17:01,471 --> 00:17:02,051
We're sorry.

194
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,040
You gotta remake the model with shoes off.

195
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,181
You can't just make a sock colored shoe.

196
00:17:09,201 --> 00:17:09,941
It looks horrifying.

197
00:17:11,841 --> 00:17:12,261
We tried.

198
00:17:14,282 --> 00:17:16,002
Mocap worked well for musical performances too.

199
00:17:16,142 --> 00:17:19,763
We did an acoustic performance of our first song, Follow and Follow, for Day of the Devs.

200
00:17:20,343 --> 00:17:24,004
You'll notice here we did some full body animation in addition to the face mocap.

201
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:30,205
So for this we pre-animated the body and then I live performed the head and neck on top of animation.

202
00:17:30,994 --> 00:17:35,076
It was a really bizarre feeling to perform that way, but I think it works, so I'll play you a bit of that.

203
00:17:35,716 --> 00:17:57,165
Let it break, let it melt slowly Even take it a bit lonely Wide awake, it's just standing On the verge of tears, you're dancing On the verge of tears, you're dancing On the verge of tears, you're dancing On the verge of tears, you're dancing

204
00:18:01,694 --> 00:18:22,684
Every time I cancel, every time I cancel you I just wanna dance, oh I just wanna dance with you Is it falling apart or was it already broken?

205
00:18:23,104 --> 00:18:24,945
Am I back at the start?

206
00:18:24,985 --> 00:18:27,387
Can I let all the hope in?

207
00:18:34,658 --> 00:18:37,005
and that is our series composer OmniBoy on keys.

208
00:18:39,096 --> 00:18:41,817
So I got a whole year of training as Luka by doing these things.

209
00:18:42,097 --> 00:18:51,360
So by the time we released the game and the EP, I was comfortable enough with running the tech, playing Luka and singing live as Luka that I could do it in higher stakes situations.

210
00:18:52,001 --> 00:18:52,741
Here's one of my favorites.

211
00:18:52,761 --> 00:18:59,063
This is an interview with Rolling Stone where they virtually inserted Luka into their New York studio.

212
00:18:59,243 --> 00:19:04,165
So he's chatting here with our songwriters, Luna Shadows and Tom Powers from the Naked and Famous.

213
00:19:05,382 --> 00:19:09,866
And please welcome our first guest, the vocalist of OFK, Luka.

214
00:19:10,027 --> 00:19:12,749
Luka, welcome to the stream.

215
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:13,750
What's up?

216
00:19:14,091 --> 00:19:15,412
It's so great to see you.

217
00:19:16,913 --> 00:19:17,774
Thanks for having me.

218
00:19:17,914 --> 00:19:21,378
How have you felt kind of seeing the story play out from week to week?

219
00:19:21,438 --> 00:19:23,340
And we're coming up on the finale very shortly.

220
00:19:25,023 --> 00:19:26,244
Uh, it's embarrassing.

221
00:19:30,007 --> 00:19:34,069
I mean, like, there's a lot of personal stuff in there for for all of us.

222
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:42,835
And the the writing team did a good job of working with us to make sure that like, they weren't sharing anything that was too private or shit that we hadn't kind of dealt with.

223
00:19:42,955 --> 00:19:43,996
So it's a little weird.

224
00:19:44,556 --> 00:19:49,740
Do you think that this really opens the door for other artists to get their music out through a video game medium specifically?

225
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:54,953
Yes, I would love to put all my music out through games only, but you know what that would mean.

226
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:58,035
So I'm already old and sad.

227
00:19:58,055 --> 00:19:59,996
I don't need to wait longer to get sadder.

228
00:20:00,016 --> 00:20:05,340
If you're having trouble writing your game, just wait longer to get sadder.

229
00:20:08,182 --> 00:20:12,665
We did more elaborate productions too, the biggest being when we announced OFK at the Game Awards.

230
00:20:13,265 --> 00:20:18,188
For this, we worked with an animation studio, Art and Graft, to produce OFK's first stage performance.

231
00:20:18,449 --> 00:20:18,709
We spent

232
00:20:19,474 --> 00:20:24,018
So much money on this, so I'm going to make you watch some of it, because it only aired once.

233
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:34,647
It's been a special night already, and now I get to share with you another Game Awards first, the world premiere of a new band.

234
00:20:35,008 --> 00:20:35,968
You heard me correctly.

235
00:20:36,349 --> 00:20:39,471
They're playing their debut single, Follow Unfollow.

236
00:20:39,531 --> 00:20:42,994
Please welcome, for the first time ever, OFK.

237
00:21:26,442 --> 00:21:27,363
I'm going to cut it before the chorus.

238
00:21:27,964 --> 00:21:29,585
So, I don't know, listen to the song, please.

239
00:21:30,026 --> 00:21:31,908
I know, I know, I know.

240
00:21:32,108 --> 00:21:33,269
Gamers were so mad.

241
00:21:33,509 --> 00:21:37,874
They were like, oh, I can't believe you're a new band and you just get to be on the Game Awards right away.

242
00:21:38,474 --> 00:21:39,996
Your parents probably paid Keeley.

243
00:21:40,016 --> 00:21:41,477
I'm like, no.

244
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:44,060
I've been working on this for four years.

245
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,563
I'm like, yeah.

246
00:21:46,783 --> 00:21:48,805
But we wanted to impress Keeley, so we made a big fancy thing.

247
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:50,567
gamers.

248
00:21:51,547 --> 00:21:53,848
Let's take a moment.

249
00:21:55,129 --> 00:21:57,770
Recently we started doing actual live performances in the real world.

250
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:02,712
It's always been a part of my hope for the project to see our band live beyond its video game.

251
00:22:03,132 --> 00:22:07,253
For fans to see that, like, no, we actually were a band outside of that game.

252
00:22:08,114 --> 00:22:09,174
And you will see us on a stage.

253
00:22:09,694 --> 00:22:12,956
So, hey, hire us to play your events if you run events such as this one.

254
00:22:14,582 --> 00:22:16,524
a little bit sad, or at least less fun.

255
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:19,748
Operating like this was exhausting and rife with some dilemmas.

256
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:31,302
Extra work.

257
00:22:32,103 --> 00:22:38,848
It's a tremendous gift for me as a performer type person to creative direct this game and give live performances, but it is a lot of extra jobs.

258
00:22:39,469 --> 00:22:47,475
When I was streaming regularly to get our Twitch account up to affiliate status, it meant working a whole workday and then refilling my water and sitting back down to the same desk to live stream.

259
00:22:48,296 --> 00:22:51,018
It's fun for me, but it is tiring and it's not sustainable.

260
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:55,662
It also took extra work from our team so that they could interact with the band on social media.

261
00:22:56,488 --> 00:23:06,476
I had a lot of media training conversations with team members who were confused about how to discuss the project publicly, what was the secret and what wasn't, how to talk about their work, how to talk to the band on Twitter.

262
00:23:08,938 --> 00:23:10,900
You may have noticed a pattern with all these videos.

263
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,121
It's the Luca show.

264
00:23:13,122 --> 00:23:15,464
But OFK has four band members, not one.

265
00:23:16,565 --> 00:23:17,946
Also, Luca is the only white one.

266
00:23:18,644 --> 00:23:22,566
and building a diverse team and story was so fundamental to how we built Team OFK.

267
00:23:23,346 --> 00:23:27,108
Whom we hired, who owns revenue share, full salary transparency.

268
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:30,250
This is so important to the politics and ethics of our team.

269
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:32,711
And we kind of backed ourselves into a corner.

270
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:36,773
My character, Luca, is the only member of OFK who's played by a member of the dev team.

271
00:23:37,418 --> 00:23:42,300
The other incredible performers, and if you haven't played at OFK, I can't recommend it enough just for their performances alone.

272
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,621
But the other performers are professional full-time actors.

273
00:23:46,161 --> 00:23:49,522
And in working with your actors professionally, you don't ask them to work for free.

274
00:23:50,182 --> 00:23:54,344
But we didn't have budget to go back into the video studio every time we got a promo opportunity.

275
00:23:54,924 --> 00:23:59,546
So time after time, the only character we could feature for these virtual identity appearances was Luca.

276
00:24:00,786 --> 00:24:06,288
We could feature other characters in behind-the-scenes art that Nafisa Tang, our co-art director, was making.

277
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:12,402
and we write the Twitter from the voice of Itsumi, but it erects a big wall when only one actual voice is being heard.

278
00:24:14,062 --> 00:24:17,043
One exception was our feature in PlayStation State of Play.

279
00:24:17,663 --> 00:24:30,608
For this, I was able to chop up dialogue lines that we'd already recorded for the game, and by recording new lines as Luka, I recontextualized the other characters' lines to create a new interaction between the characters, which is very Frankenstein-y, but here's a bit of it.

280
00:24:31,248 --> 00:24:31,548
War.

281
00:24:33,365 --> 00:24:34,125
War sucks.

282
00:24:34,986 --> 00:24:43,670
In a world full of war, where warism just doesn't have anything to do with politics or race or imperialism.

283
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:49,232
Out there, we look to each other and to our thick arms.

284
00:24:49,972 --> 00:24:50,373
You done?

285
00:24:50,613 --> 00:24:53,134
And you're like, how did they get them that thick?

286
00:24:53,514 --> 00:24:59,337
Is this like an alternate reality where arms are just that thick or are they robot arms?

287
00:25:00,177 --> 00:25:01,458
Our last hope.

288
00:25:02,498 --> 00:25:03,138
is ARMS.

289
00:25:25,253 --> 00:25:25,773
Hey you.

290
00:25:26,194 --> 00:25:26,514
Hi!

291
00:25:26,954 --> 00:25:27,675
We're still driving.

292
00:25:28,295 --> 00:25:31,657
Jay, I heard back from the mix engineer and she's cool with getting song stems on Sunday.

293
00:25:32,057 --> 00:25:32,658
Itsu!

294
00:25:33,018 --> 00:25:34,639
How's the PlayStation blog post going?

295
00:25:35,239 --> 00:25:36,120
Are hashtags too much?

296
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,942
I want to reach more people, but I don't think I trust people who use hashtags.

297
00:25:40,403 --> 00:25:41,723
Ugh, Itsu, you're the best at this.

298
00:25:42,224 --> 00:25:42,944
I'm proud of you.

299
00:25:44,065 --> 00:25:44,925
I just do things.

300
00:25:45,566 --> 00:25:46,086
Carter!

301
00:25:46,306 --> 00:25:46,967
Whatcha working on?

302
00:25:47,567 --> 00:25:50,309
Just a little audio filter I cooked up for debug here.

303
00:25:51,415 --> 00:26:06,448
So it works well, it just takes a lot of extra time, my free time, and I have my limits, and we also had to pull animators to work on this as well.

304
00:26:08,089 --> 00:26:13,454
As I share all this, to me it kind of sounds like I'm making excuses for failures in planning, and I guess I am.

305
00:26:14,417 --> 00:26:21,840
The degree to which we leaned into creating virtual identities grew over time, and the time and budget for VO didn't.

306
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:30,643
I put a huge chunk of my own savings into finishing OFK, and even with that, as indie games often are, at the end, we were tight on money.

307
00:26:31,823 --> 00:26:39,066
In hindsight, I would have reserved money to pay the actors for other appearances and set aside more time for me to develop the mocap rigs for the other characters.

308
00:26:39,983 --> 00:26:50,208
If we created more funded content, if we create it in the future, I know how to plan better, but we did set aside budget for marketing, and we ate into that with dev, which also often happens in indie games.

309
00:26:50,908 --> 00:26:59,872
We're doing live shows now, and those show budgets do not pay to bring actors along yet, but I hope they will, because as Luca, I miss my bandmates.

310
00:27:01,213 --> 00:27:04,454
We failed to keep the band evenly represented outside of the game.

311
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:10,987
In the game, I'm proud of the way our team represents the characters you see on screen, their backgrounds and queerness and beliefs.

312
00:27:11,688 --> 00:27:14,191
But in virtual identity space, it's all Luca.

313
00:27:14,692 --> 00:27:22,642
Fortunately for now, the game and the music have the biggest audience impact by far, but for future OFK material, we'll have to be more diligent.

314
00:27:24,937 --> 00:27:29,779
One problem I would like to think we overcame was counterbalancing the Luca dilemma with team appearances.

315
00:27:30,479 --> 00:27:37,902
When we first started ideating the virtual band, I had this thought that we would be so secretive and pretend the band was fully real, create this huge mystery.

316
00:27:38,662 --> 00:27:41,183
But doing that meant hiding bits of the creative team's work.

317
00:27:42,044 --> 00:27:47,986
And sure enough, the very first day that we went public with We Are OFK at the Game Awards, this created interpersonal conflict.

318
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:54,995
I thought I'd primed team members for the plan, we would acknowledge the dev team, but the characters would also get some credit for work.

319
00:27:55,815 --> 00:27:56,776
And I was wrong about this.

320
00:27:57,297 --> 00:27:59,258
Really quickly, I hurt members of our team.

321
00:27:59,758 --> 00:28:01,580
They felt hidden, they felt uncredited.

322
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:06,163
And in cases where they fictionally shared credit with the virtual band, they still felt that loss of credit.

323
00:28:08,045 --> 00:28:09,966
So we pivoted, like very quickly.

324
00:28:10,947 --> 00:28:11,968
This one was fixable.

325
00:28:12,168 --> 00:28:17,512
And since then, we've tried to build a world around OFK where the virtual band coexists with the team.

326
00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:25,465
Um, here's a little clip of a panel, our team members, uh, talking with Luca for our Ludo Nerecon panel last year.

327
00:28:26,005 --> 00:28:38,296
You know, I'm not, I'm not even a musician and this, my friend, this, this similar thing happened to me recently where my friend was like, Claire, are you in a band?

328
00:28:38,376 --> 00:28:38,936
Music.

329
00:28:39,397 --> 00:28:40,998
And I was like, you know, I'm not.

330
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:46,141
You know me, but I am.

331
00:28:46,921 --> 00:28:49,862
So I was like, I guess it's working, you know?

332
00:28:50,282 --> 00:28:53,763
People are getting what we're putting down.

333
00:28:54,343 --> 00:28:56,984
And I feel like it's more fun this way.

334
00:28:59,164 --> 00:29:07,626
So yeah, I guess like a bonus that you get to call your game studio a band, which is like, and whenever someone makes that joke, like, when's the band, when's the album dropping?

335
00:29:07,646 --> 00:29:08,926
You'd be like, November.

336
00:29:10,787 --> 00:29:11,407
Please stream it.

337
00:29:14,518 --> 00:29:18,400
Oh, and here's our lead developer, Jared Huntley, talking with Luca for our Nintendo Switch announcement.

338
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,480
I really like this.

339
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:20,821
Hey, everyone.

340
00:29:21,261 --> 00:29:24,382
I'm Jared Huntley, lead programmer on We Are OFK.

341
00:29:24,782 --> 00:29:27,843
And I'm Luca Le Fay, lead singer of the band OFK.

342
00:29:28,483 --> 00:29:32,805
We're super excited to announce that our music biopic game is coming to Nintendo Switch.

343
00:29:33,205 --> 00:29:33,605
Yes!

344
00:29:34,085 --> 00:29:35,986
Ooh, I can play it on a tour bus.

345
00:29:36,546 --> 00:29:38,027
Ugh, I can't wait to tour together.

346
00:29:38,467 --> 00:29:43,388
We haven't seen each other since that music video brainstorm at your place in LA in 2019?

347
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:44,688
Yeah, wow, wow.

348
00:29:44,968 --> 00:29:51,329
And with the game on handheld, it'll be easy to play the new episodes that are coming out every single week, back to back to back.

349
00:29:51,769 --> 00:29:54,250
Can't wait to share OFK's story and music with y'all.

350
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:57,230
Hey, Jared, can I get your opinion on tour outfits?

351
00:29:59,431 --> 00:29:59,771
Hey.

352
00:30:01,151 --> 00:30:03,031
And then that guy has to go like that or whatever.

353
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:04,192
The Switch guy.

354
00:30:04,872 --> 00:30:05,772
Because I don't remember that guy.

355
00:30:11,649 --> 00:30:17,175
After that shift, our character designer, Naff, no longer had to pretend to just be the band's stylist or fashion designer.

356
00:30:17,536 --> 00:30:19,318
They can take credit for designing the characters.

357
00:30:20,059 --> 00:30:21,060
Does it break the fiction?

358
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:21,861
I mean, yeah.

359
00:30:22,141 --> 00:30:23,282
But also, no one cares.

360
00:30:23,563 --> 00:30:24,263
No one cares.

361
00:30:25,253 --> 00:30:29,154
I think back to that Hatsune Miku show that inspired me, and I know no one believes she's real.

362
00:30:29,554 --> 00:30:39,077
And sure, we do sometimes confuse press when we tell them that the dev team are friends with the band, with like a straight face, but it's the more caring approach and it's more fun for all of us, so they'll figure it out.

363
00:30:40,177 --> 00:30:46,818
The only thing I haven't been able to do is figure out how to get me, Teddy, and me, Luca, into the room at the same time.

364
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:48,539
So I'm gonna do that now.

365
00:30:50,874 --> 00:30:55,137
in a live motion capture demo at GDC running off of Unity.

366
00:30:56,237 --> 00:31:01,601
So... Nobody?

367
00:31:05,023 --> 00:31:05,743
Hi, Adriel!

368
00:31:07,084 --> 00:31:07,384
Great!

369
00:31:08,925 --> 00:31:10,206
Is anyone here a game developer?

370
00:31:11,707 --> 00:31:13,168
Yeah, applause!

371
00:31:13,448 --> 00:31:13,968
You didn't clap.

372
00:31:16,311 --> 00:31:17,672
I think it's literally everyone here, right?

373
00:31:17,952 --> 00:31:23,135
By definition, if you pay more than $100 to sit in a chair and listen to someone talk in San Francisco, you're a developer.

374
00:31:25,056 --> 00:31:27,938
Anyway, yeah, it's weird talking to you like this.

375
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:32,361
We haven't done a lot of live shows, so usually I can't see the audience, and I can't whoop.

376
00:31:33,742 --> 00:31:34,062
Oh, wait.

377
00:31:34,202 --> 00:31:35,863
Oh, wait, did anyone here work on KDA?

378
00:31:36,243 --> 00:31:37,404
Just before I say anything?

379
00:31:39,585 --> 00:31:39,826
OK.

380
00:31:40,586 --> 00:31:45,309
Like, nothing but love for KDA, but we use their name a lot for this talk title, and we didn't ask for permission or whatever.

381
00:31:46,215 --> 00:31:50,460
Um, anyway, yeah, so I guess it's obvious I'm played by Teddy.

382
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:56,486
We're similar enough that we have the same opinions about big stuff, similar backgrounds, but different lives for sure.

383
00:31:57,407 --> 00:31:58,348
Teddy's non-binary.

384
00:31:58,648 --> 00:32:03,633
They came out during production of the game and that's been interesting for the two of us to navigate.

385
00:32:04,454 --> 00:32:06,376
I don't know if I should change to be more like Teddy.

386
00:32:06,537 --> 00:32:08,819
I guess there wouldn't be any harm in that.

387
00:32:10,273 --> 00:32:13,856
Sometimes in interviews, Teddy will use some truths from their life, but not fully.

388
00:32:14,496 --> 00:32:22,242
It's important that we respect their privacy, but they have to write and perform as me live, and I know that in a pinch, it helps them if our lives converge a little bit.

389
00:32:23,003 --> 00:32:23,783
It's a work in progress.

390
00:32:24,804 --> 00:32:25,164
I don't know.

391
00:32:26,485 --> 00:32:31,189
The events from our video game take place in the near past for me, and in the distant past for Teddy.

392
00:32:31,949 --> 00:32:37,474
We don't share any stories directly, but we definitely share states of mind, struggles that we've both had,

393
00:32:38,427 --> 00:32:42,188
I don't know if I'm comfortable being this version of myself from five years ago.

394
00:32:42,949 --> 00:32:44,930
I'm not always proud of who I was five years ago.

395
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:47,070
I was sometimes oblivious to my friends.

396
00:32:47,431 --> 00:32:49,191
I was a little dodgy, flighty.

397
00:32:51,212 --> 00:32:53,773
When you finish a project, I feel like most of us want to move on.

398
00:32:54,393 --> 00:32:59,555
Like we started it with different ideals or different priorities, and it feels weird to be stuck in that place.

399
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:02,656
It's kind of like performing a song I wrote a while back.

400
00:33:02,977 --> 00:33:06,358
It's an old feeling, but I have to reconnect with it somehow, I guess.

401
00:33:07,734 --> 00:33:17,260
I'm proud of OFK and its worldview and its messages of hope and minor victories in the face of existential fears and imposter syndrome and trouble communicating with people we want to love.

402
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:28,506
I think today Teddy is better at loving than I am, but I guess I can just fast forward, catch up to Teddy and see if we can move forward together.

403
00:33:30,387 --> 00:33:31,107
Okay, bye.

404
00:33:31,128 --> 00:33:31,188
Bye.

405
00:33:40,666 --> 00:33:41,146
It worked!

406
00:33:41,366 --> 00:33:41,607
Okay.

407
00:33:44,608 --> 00:33:46,129
Yeah, I'll speak up, thank you.

408
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:48,750
Thanks, Carrie.

409
00:33:50,471 --> 00:33:51,312
It's caught, okay.

410
00:33:52,372 --> 00:33:53,193
Alright, smooth sailing.

411
00:33:56,704 --> 00:33:56,984
Really?

412
00:33:58,185 --> 00:34:00,167
They said my posture is flawless for the camera.

413
00:34:01,108 --> 00:34:02,750
Okay, so the future and dangers.

414
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:08,074
I've touched on the difficulties and dilemmas we faced with OFK's virtual identities, but I want to revisit those as a focal point here.

415
00:34:08,555 --> 00:34:23,068
Because these days when it comes to technology, parasocial relationships, AI, game companies, especially for profit ones, especially publicly traded companies, they are by and large a lot more about what they can do with technology than what is right to do, what is healthy, what is caring.

416
00:34:24,798 --> 00:34:25,138
Scale.

417
00:34:25,959 --> 00:34:30,361
As a team grows, how you coalesce the values of that team into a single voice is hard.

418
00:34:30,981 --> 00:34:35,484
You could argue we already do that in games, but it is more pointed with virtual identities.

419
00:34:36,104 --> 00:34:39,285
You can't ask a game a question and get an answer, usually.

420
00:34:39,766 --> 00:34:41,827
A game can't make an appearance at a fundraiser.

421
00:34:41,927 --> 00:34:43,268
A game can't get in an argument.

422
00:34:44,888 --> 00:34:45,309
Brands.

423
00:34:45,689 --> 00:34:46,869
Brands are not identities.

424
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:49,411
The Wendy's Twitter account is not a person.

425
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:52,852
A game's publisher, Twitter, is not a person.

426
00:34:53,952 --> 00:34:56,794
Hell, most game studios' accounts are not a person, and neither is OFK.

427
00:34:57,555 --> 00:34:58,836
You have to keep that in mind.

428
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:11,925
Virtual identities are the most unforgiving sieve of whether a group of people are aligned in their ideologies, because you have one voice speaking for everyone, often live, under pressure.

429
00:35:14,181 --> 00:35:34,990
talk about parasocial relationships if you're not familiar with this term it refers to the one-sided relationships that develop between fans and the artists they follow it's a very common practice among social media influencers today to encourage parasocial relationships by which the influencer will ask questions to their audience or encourage participation or affiliation through a discord you know like they'll they'll post a photo and be like

430
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:37,127
out here eating chips.

431
00:35:37,448 --> 00:35:39,449
Like, what's your favorite flavor of chips?

432
00:35:39,669 --> 00:35:42,430
Let me know in the comments and then you know, comments.

433
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:46,592
And many fans come to feel that they have a closer relationship with their idol than they do.

434
00:35:47,452 --> 00:35:50,774
When you operate a virtual character, this shit gets extra complicated.

435
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:53,095
How to be genuine when you're not wholly real.

436
00:35:53,795 --> 00:35:58,337
When I play Luca, I do try to invent fiction on the fly to preserve my own privacy.

437
00:35:58,878 --> 00:36:03,880
I'll make up details about Luca hanging out with other members of the band earlier that day, maybe eating chips.

438
00:36:05,461 --> 00:36:05,881
Sometimes

439
00:36:06,547 --> 00:36:07,067
It's a great word.

440
00:36:08,748 --> 00:36:15,111
Sometimes I base those realities on my own reality, but only loosely, just to help me keep facts straight when I'm trying to make this stuff up live.

441
00:36:15,852 --> 00:36:18,053
What I refuse to be dishonest about is emotion.

442
00:36:18,653 --> 00:36:28,558
Getting on a Twitch stream and telling the chat that I'm feeling depressed when I'm not is asking for emotional labor for a fictional construct, and to me, that crosses an ethical line that I've drawn.

443
00:36:29,398 --> 00:36:36,241
On the flip side, if I am feeling sad or anxious, I will share that with the audience because it helps me feel that I'm speaking from the heart.

444
00:36:36,901 --> 00:36:40,282
Plus, they know that somewhere on the other side of Luca is a person.

445
00:36:40,862 --> 00:36:42,543
And if they do any homework, they know it's me.

446
00:36:42,903 --> 00:36:45,424
So in our case, I feel like it's okay to share to a certain degree.

447
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:54,827
What I'm saying is that the dangers of parasocial relationships, of manipulating people's emotions and emotional investment in order to get them to buy a product is not okay.

448
00:36:55,488 --> 00:36:58,969
And you do have to be supremely careful when you're operating a virtual identity.

449
00:37:00,401 --> 00:37:01,381
I forgot I have glasses.

450
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:04,122
Representation.

451
00:37:04,702 --> 00:37:06,322
I'm ending on this one because it's the most important.

452
00:37:06,982 --> 00:37:14,364
Arguably, OFK is even a half measure because I'm a white person up here with an undue amount of visibility from the rest of our team.

453
00:37:15,224 --> 00:37:18,445
OFK team friends, if there's any OFK, can you stand up?

454
00:37:18,565 --> 00:37:19,445
Is anyone in the crowd?

455
00:37:20,685 --> 00:37:21,545
Is Adriel still here?

456
00:37:22,185 --> 00:37:22,846
Shout out to Adriel.

457
00:37:23,246 --> 00:37:29,627
If you have questions after the talk, please ask me, but you're also welcome to talk to the team, too, because you've just heard a lot of what I have to say already.

458
00:37:31,735 --> 00:37:37,683
The games industry is paying better attention to the equitable representation of diverse stories and perspectives on screen, gradually.

459
00:37:38,183 --> 00:37:43,450
We're also seeing more diverse hiring, gradually, with studios being more careful to pay people whose stories they're telling.

460
00:37:44,391 --> 00:37:46,654
We are still failing miserably at the balance of power.

461
00:37:47,225 --> 00:37:56,129
And most game studios that push their BIPOC or queer employees to the front of the team photo, those photos are not the highest, those employees are not the highest paid or the most senior.

462
00:37:56,989 --> 00:38:00,611
And it's crucial to be asking more directly, who profits from the success of a game?

463
00:38:00,731 --> 00:38:01,371
Who profits?

464
00:38:02,271 --> 00:38:10,955
Diversity funds at consoles and publishers have to go beyond seeing a PowerPoint slide with diverse faces on it before they're giving money and actually ask, who owns revenue share?

465
00:38:11,315 --> 00:38:12,756
Who is empowered to make choices?

466
00:38:13,703 --> 00:38:17,645
We had a number of discussions about diversity funding with outside partners who didn't ask for any of that.

467
00:38:19,486 --> 00:38:21,667
And we were like, please, take our receipts.

468
00:38:24,228 --> 00:38:25,969
So should you create a virtual identity?

469
00:38:26,249 --> 00:38:34,173
In the interest of giving you the most information, and in the interest of you giving my talk a good review, here's a slide with some pros and cons.

470
00:38:34,513 --> 00:38:36,214
So fill out your survey at the end of the talk, please.

471
00:38:39,415 --> 00:38:40,556
They tell me you got to say that.

472
00:38:40,876 --> 00:38:42,277
It's part of the cons.

473
00:38:43,987 --> 00:39:03,661
You have to invent new story on the fly, but honestly I don't know if fans will hold you too closely to it and I got pretty good at dodging details during live streams by just like being charming and like being Winking if you got to make sure your mocap can wink By the time my co-writer Claire Gia and I finished all the scripts I had a pretty strong grasp of Lucas daily life and mannerisms.

474
00:39:03,801 --> 00:39:04,502
So this got easier

475
00:39:05,807 --> 00:39:09,289
There can be big representation issues if one virtual character is repping the whole team.

476
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:11,230
But that happens already, I guess.

477
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:14,332
Like, every GDC talk this week will be people representing their whole teams.

478
00:39:15,373 --> 00:39:17,394
But with virtual identity, the difficulty gets higher.

479
00:39:18,877 --> 00:39:22,238
Operating a virtual identity is essentially running a live service game, right?

480
00:39:22,918 --> 00:39:26,679
Except the live content is your social media and more content that you produce.

481
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:37,002
I guess you could make your social media manager the virtual character if you have one and can afford like have that role, but that's not always the skill set or the project ownership of a social media manager inherently.

482
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:37,542
team.

483
00:39:56,997 --> 00:39:57,137
I'm

484
00:40:18,191 --> 00:40:19,151
You get direct engagement.

485
00:40:19,652 --> 00:40:22,053
As game devs, we rarely get to engage directly with our fans.

486
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,374
So this is pretty great, at least for me, an extrovert.

487
00:40:24,894 --> 00:40:28,156
Time to talk with fans and hear what they want to say to your characters is really special.

488
00:40:29,394 --> 00:40:29,814
Promotion.

489
00:40:29,914 --> 00:40:31,595
I've shared a lot of fun examples of what we got to do.

490
00:40:32,115 --> 00:40:39,658
It opens up a lot of creative avenues for spreading the word during an era where promoting your game is a thankless, endless, grim social media landscape.

491
00:40:39,718 --> 00:40:43,239
And TikTok is already tipping down on how it treats its users' attention.

492
00:40:44,439 --> 00:40:45,720
But it also helps you pitch stuff, right?

493
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,520
We got Rolling Stone.

494
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,341
We got to be on Rolling Stone because I was like, yo, we can do this virtual thing.

495
00:40:49,361 --> 00:40:50,481
And they were like, well, that's so cool.

496
00:40:51,202 --> 00:40:51,882
And it is so cool.

497
00:40:53,703 --> 00:40:54,303
Social values.

498
00:40:54,964 --> 00:41:02,908
If you can navigate a lot of the social and team dynamic pitfalls of running a virtual character, it's a great pointed vehicle for communicating your team's values to the world.

499
00:41:03,528 --> 00:41:07,370
A way for your team to speak to more current events that may not be touched on in your game's story.

500
00:41:07,911 --> 00:41:14,694
Virtual characters getting political is maybe a scary prospect to you, but games not being political is a more dangerous reality.

501
00:41:16,215 --> 00:41:16,935
Stand for something.

502
00:41:17,396 --> 00:41:19,977
You can't have a virtual identity without an identity.

503
00:41:22,734 --> 00:41:24,375
So, that's Luca and me.

504
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:27,919
I have failed in a lot of ways building and running this character.

505
00:41:28,479 --> 00:41:31,502
Most pointedly, failing to get the other characters live the way Luca is.

506
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:34,805
But, I've been up here to hopefully share that in an honest way.

507
00:41:35,505 --> 00:41:36,406
So I'll leave you with this.

508
00:41:37,547 --> 00:41:40,529
If you're gonna create a virtual character, find your way to be honest.

509
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:43,812
Be genuine, be authentic through fiction.

510
00:41:44,653 --> 00:41:46,154
And the same really goes for any game you make.

511
00:41:46,294 --> 00:41:48,196
Please, stand for something.

512
00:41:49,978 --> 00:41:50,178
Thanks.

513
00:42:01,032 --> 00:42:05,154
Remember when people used to do this when people were clapping for them?

514
00:42:05,754 --> 00:42:06,354
Where did this go?

515
00:42:07,995 --> 00:42:09,916
There's microphones.

516
00:42:09,976 --> 00:42:10,837
I can't see anything.

517
00:42:12,857 --> 00:42:18,340
Does anyone have questions or want to challenge me to a game of Yu-Gi-Oh?

518
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,381
Is it cool if you go to the mic?

519
00:42:21,462 --> 00:42:23,482
I'll repeat the question anyway, but just so everyone can hear.

520
00:42:27,724 --> 00:42:28,705
I can't believe the mocap worked.

521
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:32,051
It's way too high.

522
00:42:32,571 --> 00:42:32,951
Oh no!

523
00:42:34,472 --> 00:42:35,493
I will just talk like this.

524
00:42:36,794 --> 00:42:39,896
It's a coincidence purely I'm wearing a Hatsune Miku jacket.

525
00:42:40,277 --> 00:42:40,637
What?

526
00:42:41,057 --> 00:42:41,597
I know, right?

527
00:42:41,818 --> 00:42:42,258
It's crazy.

528
00:42:42,478 --> 00:42:42,918
It's crazy.

529
00:42:43,098 --> 00:42:54,867
But anyway, it's happened a lot with mostly VTubers where sometimes they're under contract and their personality can sometimes blur a bit

530
00:42:55,487 --> 00:42:55,567
to

531
00:43:17,333 --> 00:43:23,237
Person to play them or is it too intrinsically tied and the band would cease like what would happen in the replacement?

532
00:43:23,557 --> 00:43:28,140
Yeah I was I was just looking at the seraphine Twitter this morning seraphine.

533
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:28,960
Yeah, exactly.

534
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:45,990
Yeah Seraphine was riots follow up to Katie and she's like an indie singer songwriter and she had a lot of she got a lot of criticism for being Manipulative with parasocial relationships because she was like I'm feeling depressed Um, I was looking at her Twitter cuz like her last tweet was just like I need to spend more time offline and everyone Yeah, good luck seraphine

535
00:43:49,639 --> 00:43:57,826
Yeah, also there was a Gorillaz livestream recently and I learned, I didn't know this, that the characters are now played by voice actors, or at least some of them are.

536
00:43:58,907 --> 00:44:02,930
Because I think Jamie Hewlett, the artist, didn't want to play his character anymore.

537
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:03,911
He was just tired of doing it.

538
00:44:04,351 --> 00:44:05,692
And I think that's fine.

539
00:44:05,812 --> 00:44:07,234
I think replacing is interesting.

540
00:44:07,354 --> 00:44:13,319
I think if I just get tired of carrying it or we have no money or whatever, I just

541
00:44:14,454 --> 00:44:14,614
I think

542
00:44:32,495 --> 00:44:32,775
like this

543
00:44:52,179 --> 00:44:53,720
stopping operating a virtual character.

544
00:44:55,240 --> 00:45:02,143
Yeah, I guess the last thing I'll say is like, I touched on this a little bit, but just accepting that like, you're not fooling anybody is really important.

545
00:45:02,203 --> 00:45:08,005
I think for a lot of VTubers, that separation, they feel like a protection that they have their VTuber as a separate person.

546
00:45:08,025 --> 00:45:13,327
So they really want to believe that that wall is strong and impenetrable, but people know that there's a human being, right?

547
00:45:13,367 --> 00:45:20,070
So like, again, it's just, it's one of those moments of like being careful about what the... Okay, thank you very much.

548
00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:20,810
Thank you.

549
00:45:22,162 --> 00:45:22,322
Yeah?

550
00:45:24,504 --> 00:45:26,485
Hey, great session, by the way.

551
00:45:26,886 --> 00:45:27,546
Thank you.

552
00:45:27,826 --> 00:45:33,430
What would you say is the biggest difference between you and Luca, and why did you create that difference?

553
00:45:35,792 --> 00:45:39,755
So the question is, what's the biggest difference between me and Luca, and why did we create that difference?

554
00:45:39,935 --> 00:45:41,096
He also said, great session.

555
00:45:42,217 --> 00:45:43,158
It's just a camera nasty.

556
00:45:43,238 --> 00:45:43,838
It was, it was.

557
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:47,141
Write your feedback.

558
00:45:47,481 --> 00:45:48,041
Take your reviews.

559
00:45:51,772 --> 00:45:54,583
This is the same thing I do on Twitch streams, which is I'm stalling while I think about the question.

560
00:45:57,912 --> 00:46:01,553
I mean, so for one, it's not like I started from me.

561
00:46:02,613 --> 00:46:06,034
Claire and I wrote the characters from the point of view of just writing any other characters.

562
00:46:06,214 --> 00:46:08,275
But I did have an idea that it was going to be a self-insert.

563
00:46:08,295 --> 00:46:14,337
So actually, there were elements of, for example, during the character design process, where NAF was pitching ideas.

564
00:46:14,797 --> 00:46:20,579
And I was like, oh, I don't think I can make my voice embody a certain design.

565
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:24,220
Admittedly, I pulled the visual design closer to myself.

566
00:46:27,188 --> 00:46:49,264
Something that I know that at least I did in an exercise for all the characters was to take something, I learned this from like a writer who I really admire, it was like take something from yourself that you are the most critical of or ashamed of in your past or present and put that in a character and it's a helpful but you know risky way of

567
00:46:50,404 --> 00:46:52,324
being mean to your character.

568
00:46:52,344 --> 00:46:57,066
It can be hard when developing a character to give them real flaws that are really unforgivable.

569
00:46:57,946 --> 00:46:59,186
So Luca has some of that.

570
00:46:59,546 --> 00:47:02,747
His plot line has to do with being indecisive and being flaky.

571
00:47:02,827 --> 00:47:06,688
And these are things that I felt like I had let people down in my life.

572
00:47:07,288 --> 00:47:12,269
But beyond that, it's not exactly a process of starting from me and moving backwards.

573
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:14,550
It was a little bit more of what you can seed into any character.

574
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:15,750
So I think in that way,

575
00:47:18,083 --> 00:47:18,203
Hello.

576
00:47:36,325 --> 00:47:36,505
Cool.

577
00:47:36,886 --> 00:47:38,087
Hi, thank you so much for your talk.

578
00:47:38,707 --> 00:47:41,210
So confession, I'm a VTuber.

579
00:47:41,991 --> 00:47:46,995
I started being a VTuber before I became a game developer and then I became a game developer in software.

580
00:47:47,976 --> 00:48:00,448
But because I was an independent VTuber before developing software, a lot of my own personal identity has kind of become wrapped up in kind of my own brand because that's something that I managed for myself.

581
00:48:01,369 --> 00:48:22,697
So as I continue to navigate the game developer world, trying to figure out where that brand intersects with my game developer persona, and how to manifest that in public appearances, especially as somebody who is trans and non-binary, and trying my best to be visible,

582
00:48:23,464 --> 00:48:24,324
the world and whatever.

583
00:48:25,064 --> 00:48:38,348
So I was wondering like if you have any insights on what happens when the virtual identity so closely overlaps with your own personal identity and kind of like navigating that space.

584
00:48:40,589 --> 00:48:40,849
Some.

585
00:48:40,909 --> 00:48:41,649
Thank you for that question.

586
00:48:42,429 --> 00:48:47,371
Now I'm all nervous because you're like you know what you know how this goes.

587
00:48:48,083 --> 00:48:48,763
Probably better than I do.

588
00:48:49,443 --> 00:49:00,146
The question is, and forgive me for a bad recap, but what to do when your own personal brand or identity is getting closer to the characters and how to deal with that in terms of engaging with the community.

589
00:49:02,667 --> 00:49:11,669
I guess my specific experience is that, once again, for me, it was one of those things of like, I don't think people care as much as I felt like they did.

590
00:49:12,281 --> 00:49:17,965
was like, oh, how do I behave on my personal Twitter versus when I'm in control of the OFK Twitter or Lucas Twitter?

591
00:49:18,545 --> 00:49:21,327
How do I make sure those are separate?

592
00:49:22,768 --> 00:49:24,369
For me, at least, there's less overlap.

593
00:49:24,429 --> 00:49:30,173
There's a lot less overlap with who's following me as Teddy, the game developer or whatever, and who's following the band.

594
00:49:31,254 --> 00:49:37,738
And even when I started being less secretive about it, being like, okay, I'll talk about Teddy's existence.

595
00:49:38,138 --> 00:49:41,941
Still, it's not like I saw some... I wasn't pouring followers from OFK into Teddy.

596
00:49:42,902 --> 00:49:54,931
An interesting example of this is that some musician friends of mine who are in really big bands, like Coachella bands, nobody follows them and nobody cares.

597
00:49:55,051 --> 00:49:59,514
I mean, people care, but they're there to follow the project or the specific thing.

598
00:49:59,935 --> 00:50:03,918
And so it's already hard enough if you want to, to get people to cross over.

599
00:50:04,018 --> 00:50:11,164
So again, just in my experience, it's okay if they get closer and I worry less about, oh, I have to be super different in both.

600
00:50:11,784 --> 00:50:17,488
because no one's really watching as closely as I fear that they are, and certainly not in a critical way.

601
00:50:17,668 --> 00:50:21,750
I mean, people are always critical on the internet, but that's my anecdotal experience.

602
00:50:22,491 --> 00:50:22,791
Thank you.

603
00:50:22,991 --> 00:50:23,271
Thank you.

604
00:50:24,392 --> 00:50:25,153
We've got three more minutes.

605
00:50:25,173 --> 00:50:25,493
We've got time.

606
00:50:25,773 --> 00:50:25,933
Hi.

607
00:50:26,393 --> 00:50:26,673
Hello.

608
00:50:26,934 --> 00:50:28,415
Best GDC talk ever, by the way.

609
00:50:28,955 --> 00:50:29,235
Thank you.

610
00:50:29,255 --> 00:50:29,695
I'll speak up.

611
00:50:30,176 --> 00:50:30,416
Thank you.

612
00:50:31,116 --> 00:50:38,301
How did your relationship to making We Are OFK change by having a character that represented so much of yourself and your own issues in the game?

613
00:50:44,439 --> 00:50:45,019
Good question.

614
00:50:45,579 --> 00:50:54,323
What's funny for me, the question is how did my relationship with making We Are OFK change when there's a character who has so much of me in it, sort of.

615
00:50:55,023 --> 00:50:56,704
Also, they said best talk ever for the camera.

616
00:50:56,784 --> 00:50:57,304
Best talk ever.

617
00:50:58,204 --> 00:51:00,925
I'll maybe stop doing that.

618
00:51:01,386 --> 00:51:11,610
Yeah, so I guess as I was saying to an earlier question, for me, what's funny is I think the stuff that I put into the characters that I'm the most

619
00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:38,431
um... have struggled with or feel the most ashamed of in my life is actually not in luca lucas stuff is a little bit more like obvious lucas laws are are very obvious from the front uh... and he gets a vocal criticism from his friends so he's actually kind of easy one whereas i think that the other characters have some like deeper again like no one to one another you know like using real life stories but i don't know if that was intentional but it definitely is a convenience that this is a little bit like

620
00:51:39,181 --> 00:51:39,802
right in your face.

621
00:51:40,103 --> 00:51:44,392
And it's not as like, for me, like painful in the way some of the other stuff is.

622
00:51:45,714 --> 00:51:46,015
Thank you.

623
00:51:46,215 --> 00:51:46,456
Thank you.

624
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:57,863
Okay, um, I was just wondering if there's ever times where your belief or like Lucas beliefs kind of push you towards like compromising your own beliefs.

625
00:51:58,524 --> 00:52:02,085
And if that were to ever happen, would how would you kind of navigate that?

626
00:52:02,125 --> 00:52:03,386
Like, would you rein him in more?

627
00:52:03,546 --> 00:52:07,987
Or would you let him kind of let loose and in a way compromise your own, like your own self?

628
00:52:08,247 --> 00:52:13,229
Yeah, the question is, like, what do I do if Lucas beliefs separate from my beliefs?

629
00:52:14,470 --> 00:52:15,170
How do I handle that?

630
00:52:15,730 --> 00:52:17,471
Um, I mean, like,

631
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:24,252
His beliefs are not going to diverge from mine on important social or political issues, right?

632
00:52:25,633 --> 00:52:29,735
And maybe that is another luxury and privilege for me as the person operating him.

633
00:52:30,735 --> 00:52:38,540
Our team is pretty aligned in political beliefs, or very aligned, I would hope, but even so, it's not like I'm checking with the team anytime he makes a political comment or something.

634
00:52:40,315 --> 00:52:57,601
That being said, the one thing I can think of, which is maybe not a belief, but a preference, is Luca is a little bit more hyper-confident than I am, or at least projects hyper-confidence, can be dismissive of criticism, can just gloat, or not gloat, but boast more.

635
00:52:58,501 --> 00:53:03,843
And as I age, I'm trying to be quieter as a person.

636
00:53:05,793 --> 00:53:09,734
quieter as a leader, softer touch in terms of trying to care for people.

637
00:53:10,254 --> 00:53:17,175
And Luca's like still kind of barreling through writing privilege and just having a grand old time.

638
00:53:17,755 --> 00:53:24,056
So that's a little awkward for me, like on live streams to do, but it's usually in a pretty safe environment.

639
00:53:24,076 --> 00:53:26,517
It's not like he's like making fun of people in the chat.

640
00:53:26,557 --> 00:53:28,517
He's not directing that towards real people.

641
00:53:29,917 --> 00:53:32,778
So that's about the most tension I felt so far, I think.

642
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:34,139
Thank you.

643
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:34,720
Thank you.

644
00:53:35,441 --> 00:53:36,922
We've got time for two more.

645
00:53:37,903 --> 00:53:39,465
We'll go here and then one at the mic.

646
00:53:39,565 --> 00:53:41,927
And then we'll talk to you afterwards for anything else.

647
00:53:42,387 --> 00:53:42,728
Hi, yeah.

648
00:53:46,251 --> 00:53:53,799
If we could actually take this to a wrap up room, it'll be in room 2014 and 2018 down the hall.

649
00:53:53,919 --> 00:53:54,459
Thank you.

650
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:54,560
Cool.

651
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:55,721
Thanks, everybody.

652
00:54:01,293 --> 00:54:01,434
so
