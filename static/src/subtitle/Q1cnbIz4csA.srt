1
00:00:02,782 --> 00:00:04,203
A very good afternoon to all of you.

2
00:00:04,223 --> 00:00:06,505
I hope you're having a great day so far.

3
00:00:07,486 --> 00:00:09,527
Very excited to be the first ever UX Summit

4
00:00:09,707 --> 00:00:09,967
here at GDC 2017.

5
00:00:12,082 --> 00:00:17,007
A brief introduction about me. I'm Om Tandon, currently working as director of UX at Digit

6
00:00:17,027 --> 00:00:22,052
Game Studios Dublin. It's Ireland's biggest independent game studio. Prior to Digit, I've

7
00:00:22,072 --> 00:00:27,117
been working as a senior UX designer and researcher for Gameloft's New Zealand and Australia studios.

8
00:00:27,617 --> 00:00:32,462
And before that, I was a creative director, UX UI, for education gaming startup Tap2Learn,

9
00:00:32,863 --> 00:00:35,525
which was incubated right here in the heart of San Francisco.

10
00:00:37,365 --> 00:00:38,886
I've been in the industry for over 12 years now,

11
00:00:39,226 --> 00:00:40,927
and I've donned many hats during my journey,

12
00:00:41,567 --> 00:00:44,109
but I must say I finally found my niche in UX.

13
00:00:45,029 --> 00:00:47,650
UX stands for Players Voice in the game development process.

14
00:00:48,271 --> 00:00:50,772
It's something I'm very passionate about as a methodology,

15
00:00:51,112 --> 00:00:53,173
and I think it has great many future applications.

16
00:00:54,974 --> 00:00:56,955
So I think that is enough introduction about me.

17
00:00:57,135 --> 00:00:58,636
Let's see what do we have for you today.

18
00:00:59,796 --> 00:01:01,257
Presenting Ice Age Adventures,

19
00:01:01,697 --> 00:01:04,498
UX Diagnosis for Live Operation Games, a Case Study.

20
00:01:06,063 --> 00:01:08,105
This is my elevator pitch, what we'll be looking at,

21
00:01:08,966 --> 00:01:11,228
how to gather data and work with other departments

22
00:01:11,328 --> 00:01:13,871
within the company, how to analyze the data

23
00:01:13,891 --> 00:01:16,133
you have collected and apply heuristic diagnosis,

24
00:01:16,794 --> 00:01:18,555
pitching a solution to the stakeholder group,

25
00:01:18,916 --> 00:01:20,717
and designing a solution that resonates

26
00:01:20,857 --> 00:01:22,479
with both business and user needs.

27
00:01:23,748 --> 00:01:26,471
A small disclaimer, a very special thanks to Gameloft.

28
00:01:27,031 --> 00:01:28,772
As you might be well aware, we are subject

29
00:01:28,792 --> 00:01:30,434
to a lot of NDAs in gaming industry.

30
00:01:30,894 --> 00:01:33,156
The case study you're about to see is a reconstruction

31
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,898
of some of the work I did on a published project.

32
00:01:36,318 --> 00:01:38,400
However, the data points and the figures

33
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:39,761
that you will see in this presentation

34
00:01:40,261 --> 00:01:42,523
are not the real data, they have been tweaked slightly

35
00:01:43,463 --> 00:01:44,704
for the benefit of this presentation.

36
00:01:46,185 --> 00:01:48,747
So, before we dive in, let's have a look at

37
00:01:48,968 --> 00:01:49,948
what the game is all about.

38
00:01:59,712 --> 00:02:01,593
There was supposed to be sound as well, but...

39
00:02:01,613 --> 00:02:02,113
Ah, it's there!

40
00:02:02,133 --> 00:02:05,974
So that was the fun part, guys!

41
00:02:24,299 --> 00:02:25,640
No, I promise there are more videos.

42
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,881
So as you can see, this game was based on a very strong IP,

43
00:02:29,262 --> 00:02:32,423
Ice Age series, which has a huge global fan following.

44
00:02:33,644 --> 00:02:35,325
It was targeted at a casual player base,

45
00:02:35,485 --> 00:02:37,966
and the game was all about rescuing animals,

46
00:02:38,246 --> 00:02:39,187
building a shelter for them,

47
00:02:39,527 --> 00:02:40,487
and the players could do that

48
00:02:40,608 --> 00:02:42,128
by playing popular casual games,

49
00:02:42,448 --> 00:02:44,710
like Match 3, Infinite Runner, and so on.

50
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:48,473
The target demographic for this game included IP fans,

51
00:02:48,633 --> 00:02:51,614
young adults, parents, and a lot of stay-at-home moms.

52
00:02:52,015 --> 00:02:53,255
A lot of this data was generated

53
00:02:53,335 --> 00:02:54,936
to our active community pages.

54
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:57,117
We had a very strong community for this game,

55
00:02:57,597 --> 00:02:59,078
and our community managers interacted

56
00:02:59,198 --> 00:03:01,338
with the most engaged players almost on a daily basis.

57
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:03,539
A few more stats about the game.

58
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:04,840
During its lifetime,

59
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,681
it racked up 40 million downloads worldwide.

60
00:03:07,101 --> 00:03:08,501
We had a super active player base

61
00:03:08,601 --> 00:03:10,022
of five million daily active users,

62
00:03:10,622 --> 00:03:12,163
and it was one of the top performers

63
00:03:12,323 --> 00:03:13,303
in Gameloft's portfolio.

64
00:03:15,673 --> 00:03:18,215
Now as a lot of my fellow UX designers would agree,

65
00:03:18,595 --> 00:03:20,677
sometimes when we are moved around projects,

66
00:03:21,097 --> 00:03:22,758
we inherit suboptimal designs.

67
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,501
What exactly do I mean by that?

68
00:03:27,382 --> 00:03:28,523
Any game designers in the house?

69
00:03:32,026 --> 00:03:33,407
So with all due respect guys,

70
00:03:33,467 --> 00:03:35,188
sometimes the systems you design,

71
00:03:35,468 --> 00:03:36,349
though they are functional,

72
00:03:36,469 --> 00:03:39,231
they're not the best example of usability and intuitiveness.

73
00:03:40,092 --> 00:03:41,533
One such system which I inherited

74
00:03:41,713 --> 00:03:43,374
when I was moved on to the Ice Age team

75
00:03:43,775 --> 00:03:45,156
was the existing Even system.

76
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:47,355
Let me give you a bit more context.

77
00:03:47,475 --> 00:03:50,358
When a game is newly launched, it generates a lot of engagement.

78
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,821
But the fact is, the longer the game stays live,

79
00:03:54,062 --> 00:03:55,763
its novelty value starts wearing off,

80
00:03:56,304 --> 00:03:59,187
and the players start getting bored of the same grinding mechanics.

81
00:04:00,068 --> 00:04:02,470
So, in order to refresh the user experience,

82
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:05,033
as developers, we have to keep adding new features.

83
00:04:05,753 --> 00:04:07,515
And that is where the Event System comes in.

84
00:04:08,992 --> 00:04:10,693
By looking at usage data, we found that

85
00:04:10,793 --> 00:04:12,954
while the average session time was around 18 minutes,

86
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:15,215
which is not bad by industry standards,

87
00:04:15,395 --> 00:04:17,636
for those players who took part in the event system,

88
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:20,038
this average went up to 30, 35 minutes,

89
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:21,879
practically double of what we were seeing.

90
00:04:22,739 --> 00:04:23,460
And it is well known,

91
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,381
if you can have players spend quality time

92
00:04:25,701 --> 00:04:28,142
and effort in your game, it's much easier to monetize them.

93
00:04:28,923 --> 00:04:30,163
So the event system was designed

94
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:32,104
to increase the average session length,

95
00:04:32,265 --> 00:04:34,746
which could then have a positive impact on our monetization.

96
00:04:36,027 --> 00:04:36,567
So far, so good.

97
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:38,880
But here was the problem.

98
00:04:40,642 --> 00:04:45,208
Nowadays when we launch a feature, most companies, there's something called a launch KPI.

99
00:04:45,609 --> 00:04:48,172
It's pretty much like what NASA does with its projects, right?

100
00:04:49,154 --> 00:04:53,139
Based on those launch KPIs, you determine whether a feature launch is successful or

101
00:04:53,219 --> 00:04:53,520
failure.

102
00:04:54,318 --> 00:05:00,182
Now the projected KPI for this game was, sorry, for this feature was 45% participation rate

103
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:01,462
of existing player base.

104
00:05:02,023 --> 00:05:07,006
However, the ground reality was only 20% of the players converted, which was of course

105
00:05:07,146 --> 00:05:07,666
disappointing.

106
00:05:09,467 --> 00:05:13,070
Now even before I start looking at data to understand where does the bottleneck lie,

107
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:16,112
it's important to start with certain assumptions.

108
00:05:16,972 --> 00:05:18,753
We had to answer two critical questions here.

109
00:05:19,514 --> 00:05:19,694
Why?

110
00:05:20,807 --> 00:05:22,248
Why do we have such poor numbers?

111
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,610
And what is causing this lack of engagement?

112
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,751
Is it the content system of the event?

113
00:05:27,532 --> 00:05:28,452
Is it not appealing enough?

114
00:05:28,753 --> 00:05:30,414
But the content pipeline was designed

115
00:05:30,614 --> 00:05:33,496
based on upcoming Ice Age movies, which was pretty new.

116
00:05:34,176 --> 00:05:36,118
And of course, we were talking to our players constantly

117
00:05:36,158 --> 00:05:37,258
through our community channels,

118
00:05:37,699 --> 00:05:39,900
asking them what kind of characters they would like to see,

119
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,681
what kind of adventures they would like to go.

120
00:05:42,522 --> 00:05:43,983
So we can safely say that was not it,

121
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,304
because we had a lot of active player feedback

122
00:05:46,545 --> 00:05:47,425
on the content design.

123
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:49,326
Then what was it?

124
00:05:50,143 --> 00:05:51,904
Is it the discovery and usability of the system?

125
00:05:52,805 --> 00:05:54,826
Are players trying to interact with the feature

126
00:05:54,886 --> 00:05:57,247
but it's so hard to use that they are getting frustrated

127
00:05:57,387 --> 00:05:57,948
and just churning?

128
00:05:58,788 --> 00:06:00,929
Or maybe the events are too hard to complete.

129
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:02,910
So the players might be signing up

130
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:04,851
but the competition level is so high

131
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:07,072
they're just not feeling like, you know,

132
00:06:07,192 --> 00:06:08,613
getting through it or getting frustrated.

133
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:12,415
In order to validate some of these hypotheses

134
00:06:12,675 --> 00:06:15,197
and rule out others, I had to work very closely

135
00:06:15,357 --> 00:06:16,938
with other departments within the company.

136
00:06:17,653 --> 00:06:22,958
For example, data scientists, who are looking at copious amount of player data, cohort analysis,

137
00:06:23,198 --> 00:06:28,002
and so on. Analytics to understand how players are interacting with this feature, where are they

138
00:06:28,022 --> 00:06:32,166
spending time, where are they dropping off. Business performance managers, who design the

139
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:37,130
soft and hard currency gates of the game. Now, just by looking at how much currencies or resources

140
00:06:37,511 --> 00:06:41,234
players are spending in a feature, you can have a pretty good idea of engagement.

141
00:06:41,655 --> 00:06:44,457
Because the more engaged they are, more resources they're going to sink.

142
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,311
and of course the community managers.

143
00:06:47,971 --> 00:06:50,093
Working with them, we could design special polls

144
00:06:50,133 --> 00:06:52,534
and surveys to gather qualitative subjective data.

145
00:06:53,895 --> 00:06:56,016
Here's an example of the kind of data we were collecting

146
00:06:56,136 --> 00:06:57,317
and how we were analyzing it.

147
00:06:58,277 --> 00:06:59,978
Number of people clicking on the events icon,

148
00:07:00,339 --> 00:07:01,940
number of people hitting the join button,

149
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,361
number of people dropping off from various drill downs,

150
00:07:04,781 --> 00:07:05,722
event completion rate,

151
00:07:05,962 --> 00:07:07,383
and specially designed surveys and polls.

152
00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:13,964
Now just by looking at the analytic funnel, we could see where exactly in the flow the

153
00:07:14,004 --> 00:07:16,327
drop was happening, where the churn was happening.

154
00:07:17,268 --> 00:07:19,251
This of course gives rise to the next natural question.

155
00:07:19,691 --> 00:07:20,893
Why is that churn happening?

156
00:07:21,834 --> 00:07:25,979
Now in order to understand that, we applied a very popular UX methodology which is called

157
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,120
heuristic diagnosis.

158
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:31,341
Heuristics stands for a set of special cardinal rules

159
00:07:31,561 --> 00:07:33,603
which when applied to a flow help us understand

160
00:07:33,763 --> 00:07:35,964
how usable or intuitive that flow is.

161
00:07:36,604 --> 00:07:37,965
You can find more information about it

162
00:07:38,145 --> 00:07:39,566
on the Nelson Norman Group website.

163
00:07:39,786 --> 00:07:40,467
I would recommend that.

164
00:07:41,487 --> 00:07:43,768
So, let's see what we uncover

165
00:07:43,969 --> 00:07:45,529
when we apply heuristic diagnosis

166
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:47,371
to our existing event game flow.

167
00:07:48,591 --> 00:07:50,052
As soon as the player comes back to the game,

168
00:07:50,152 --> 00:07:51,973
he comes to screen number one, right here.

169
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:57,635
Now, this information that a new event is available is presented as a notification pip

170
00:07:57,795 --> 00:08:01,019
in the bottom left corner of the screen, right above the trophy icon.

171
00:08:03,061 --> 00:08:06,866
To give you a bit more context, when a game is newly launched, as a UX designer, you only

172
00:08:06,926 --> 00:08:10,910
want the most important call to actions to be presented, because you don't want to

173
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:13,193
overwhelm the player or create a choice bias.

174
00:08:14,053 --> 00:08:16,174
However, as I mentioned earlier, this is also true.

175
00:08:16,514 --> 00:08:17,735
The longer the game stays live,

176
00:08:18,395 --> 00:08:20,236
in order to keep refreshing the user experience,

177
00:08:20,456 --> 00:08:21,716
we have to keep adding features.

178
00:08:22,217 --> 00:08:23,057
And what does that imply?

179
00:08:23,797 --> 00:08:25,538
For a game like ours, when the player comes back,

180
00:08:25,758 --> 00:08:27,699
he will see five to six notifications,

181
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,739
as you can see, waiting for his attention.

182
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,980
These could be the daily reward systems,

183
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,101
your alliance systems, help requests,

184
00:08:34,221 --> 00:08:35,322
special offers, and so on.

185
00:08:36,202 --> 00:08:38,423
So it is very much possible that this information,

186
00:08:38,563 --> 00:08:39,843
that a new event is available,

187
00:08:40,063 --> 00:08:41,944
might be getting drowned in that noise.

188
00:08:44,172 --> 00:08:47,936
Now if the player clicks on the event icon, somehow, he'll come to screen number two.

189
00:08:48,977 --> 00:08:51,719
Here the events are presented in a laundry list format.

190
00:08:53,321 --> 00:08:57,004
Now by their very nature, our events were designed to fall into different buckets, like

191
00:08:57,144 --> 00:08:59,266
daily, weekly, monthly, and so on.

192
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:03,510
But tell me, as a player, can you make that out just by looking at the screen?

193
00:09:04,231 --> 00:09:08,095
And that information is important, because different players will engage with different

194
00:09:08,175 --> 00:09:09,916
event types based on their preferences.

195
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:15,301
I may be the kind of player who just likes to play daily events, because that's the kind

196
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:16,642
of time commitment I want to do.

197
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:21,543
But you can see that I cannot make that decision just by looking at the information on the

198
00:09:21,563 --> 00:09:21,823
screen.

199
00:09:23,384 --> 00:09:26,845
If the player clicks on one of the event type, he's brought to screen number three, where

200
00:09:26,865 --> 00:09:31,126
you can see some more information about the rewards, some call to actions, and access

201
00:09:31,146 --> 00:09:31,747
to leaderboards.

202
00:09:32,327 --> 00:09:35,108
If you click on the leaderboard button, you're brought to screen number four.

203
00:09:36,228 --> 00:09:40,230
Here player can see the leaderboard and his position relative to rest of the players in

204
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:40,490
the game.

205
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:46,193
Now let's take a step back and try to analyze why is it in the first place a player would

206
00:09:46,213 --> 00:09:47,715
like to take part in the event system?

207
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:50,497
Well, there are two things.

208
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:51,778
What are the rewards?

209
00:09:52,438 --> 00:09:57,002
What is it I as a player will get if I take part in the event system or sink my time in

210
00:09:57,042 --> 00:09:57,122
it?

211
00:09:57,803 --> 00:09:59,284
And second, what is the risk involved?

212
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:01,946
What are my chances of getting that reward?

213
00:10:02,507 --> 00:10:04,648
And that is what comes through by looking at the leaderboard.

214
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,402
Now it is possible that at any given point of time,

215
00:10:10,363 --> 00:10:12,705
we may have three to four events running in parallel.

216
00:10:12,985 --> 00:10:15,407
Let's say daily, weekly, monthly,

217
00:10:15,908 --> 00:10:17,129
and a seasonal Halloween special.

218
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,951
Do you really think, as a player,

219
00:10:20,151 --> 00:10:22,834
I would like to go through three drilldowns and four clicks

220
00:10:23,134 --> 00:10:25,496
in order to gather all the risk and reward information

221
00:10:25,576 --> 00:10:28,518
I need for each and every event type?

222
00:10:28,979 --> 00:10:31,861
And we're talking about around 16 clicks and 12 drilldowns.

223
00:10:33,142 --> 00:10:34,523
That sounds like a lot of work, right?

224
00:10:35,023 --> 00:10:36,784
So probably the short answer is no.

225
00:10:37,245 --> 00:10:38,465
And when we looked at our analytics,

226
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:40,687
that's where we found a lot of churn happening,

227
00:10:41,047 --> 00:10:42,508
because people were losing their way

228
00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:44,450
going down these multiple drill rounds.

229
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:46,211
It was a big pain point.

230
00:10:48,393 --> 00:10:49,013
The next screen,

231
00:10:49,513 --> 00:10:50,774
this is the worst possible screen, by the way,

232
00:10:50,794 --> 00:10:51,795
which I've saved for the last.

233
00:10:52,255 --> 00:10:55,258
This is the screen the player sees when an event has expired,

234
00:10:55,518 --> 00:10:56,679
and he logs back into the game.

235
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,581
Let's try to see what's going through the player's mind

236
00:10:59,601 --> 00:11:01,182
when they see this screen.

237
00:11:01,262 --> 00:11:02,303
Yeah, there's more fun, just wait.

238
00:11:03,354 --> 00:11:05,095
So imagine you are a player returning back to the game.

239
00:11:05,576 --> 00:11:07,277
You see a nice congratulation message.

240
00:11:08,578 --> 00:11:09,279
What are we doing here?

241
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,821
What we are doing here is we are creating anticipation.

242
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:14,342
We are raising expectation.

243
00:11:14,723 --> 00:11:15,543
Imagine you are hungry.

244
00:11:16,344 --> 00:11:17,465
You walk into a pizza parlor.

245
00:11:17,765 --> 00:11:18,526
What's going through your mind?

246
00:11:19,366 --> 00:11:21,248
The chef is plating up a slice of pizza for you

247
00:11:21,468 --> 00:11:22,268
and you're salivating.

248
00:11:22,328 --> 00:11:25,611
You are expecting positive gratification any minute.

249
00:11:26,031 --> 00:11:27,452
And that's what our player is expecting.

250
00:11:28,433 --> 00:11:30,515
I mean, it's a bit exaggerated, but you get the idea.

251
00:11:32,051 --> 00:11:36,492
So, she's expecting all sorts of exotic rewards to fall her way any time soon.

252
00:11:37,432 --> 00:11:39,792
However, let's see what's actually happening.

253
00:11:41,433 --> 00:11:43,793
Here you are, coming back to the game, you see all the smoke and mirror,

254
00:11:44,013 --> 00:11:44,393
and then...

255
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:46,373
the final score is zero.

256
00:11:47,574 --> 00:11:48,534
Your rank is in thousands,

257
00:11:49,154 --> 00:11:50,974
and your reward, big, fat none.

258
00:11:51,314 --> 00:11:51,994
You don't deserve it.

259
00:11:53,175 --> 00:11:53,635
Go away.

260
00:11:55,275 --> 00:11:59,216
So, after creating anticipation and raising expectation,

261
00:11:59,536 --> 00:12:00,776
when the player sees the screen,

262
00:12:02,487 --> 00:12:04,348
She's like, what the fuck just happened?

263
00:12:06,549 --> 00:12:09,811
I mean, while she was expecting positive gratification,

264
00:12:10,351 --> 00:12:12,232
and then she sees a screen which is utterly

265
00:12:12,312 --> 00:12:14,233
lacking in any kind of encouragement,

266
00:12:15,013 --> 00:12:16,854
it seems almost like a dirty trick,

267
00:12:17,354 --> 00:12:18,435
almost like a slap in her face.

268
00:12:19,908 --> 00:12:22,249
So, after applying heuristic diagnosis,

269
00:12:22,469 --> 00:12:24,710
here's a list of issues we found out.

270
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:26,230
Three drill downs and four clicks

271
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,731
to gather all risk and reward information

272
00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:30,871
that player needs for his decision making.

273
00:12:31,492 --> 00:12:32,732
Text walls, which were repeated

274
00:12:32,832 --> 00:12:33,932
throughout all the drill downs,

275
00:12:34,032 --> 00:12:35,093
that's a suboptimal design.

276
00:12:35,673 --> 00:12:37,433
Busy layouts, confusing CTAs,

277
00:12:37,753 --> 00:12:40,394
and event overscreen, which lacks any kind of encouragement.

278
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:42,255
Yeah, that's a long list.

279
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:46,632
Now, you saw that how we collected qualitative

280
00:12:46,852 --> 00:12:49,074
and quantitative data, which helped us understand

281
00:12:49,274 --> 00:12:50,755
where exactly the churn is happening.

282
00:12:51,556 --> 00:12:52,817
We applied heuristic diagnosis,

283
00:12:52,837 --> 00:12:54,779
so we know why that churn is happening.

284
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,921
Do you think now I have enough information

285
00:12:58,182 --> 00:12:59,643
to start designing a solution?

286
00:13:01,304 --> 00:13:03,706
Not yet, because even before I can think

287
00:13:03,766 --> 00:13:04,927
of start designing a solution,

288
00:13:05,128 --> 00:13:06,409
there's one more step in between,

289
00:13:07,149 --> 00:13:08,931
and that is getting a stakeholder buy-in.

290
00:13:10,088 --> 00:13:13,011
The stakeholder group can vary in composition from company to company.

291
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:16,695
It can have your product leads, dev leads, creative directors, and so on.

292
00:13:17,716 --> 00:13:21,519
Now it is important to understand that any update schedule, as in the case of our game,

293
00:13:21,619 --> 00:13:24,282
has been decided upon three to six months in advance.

294
00:13:25,223 --> 00:13:30,307
So if you turn up at the last minute and say, hey, by the way, we have an important UX fix

295
00:13:30,347 --> 00:13:32,449
to push, it's just not going to happen.

296
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,111
Trust me, I can take my word on that.

297
00:13:35,073 --> 00:13:37,854
What we need to do is we need to get a stakeholder buy-in.

298
00:13:38,294 --> 00:13:41,036
So here I am presenting my analysis to the stakeholder group,

299
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,777
which is the product manager and the dev lead in my case,

300
00:13:44,377 --> 00:13:45,778
and the product has a question for me.

301
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:47,639
Well, this makes sense,

302
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:51,141
but why do you think it's more important than 50 other improvements

303
00:13:51,281 --> 00:13:52,381
that we already have lined up?

304
00:13:53,182 --> 00:13:54,603
And the devs have their own angle.

305
00:13:55,523 --> 00:13:56,864
Whatever solution you come up with,

306
00:13:57,204 --> 00:13:58,925
will it reuse existing widgets?

307
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:03,907
Because if the solution involves creating and writing more code,

308
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:08,044
that can inflate the sprint time, thereby delaying the overall release schedule.

309
00:14:08,484 --> 00:14:09,565
And that's going to be in my head.

310
00:14:10,446 --> 00:14:11,466
I didn't want that, of course.

311
00:14:12,487 --> 00:14:16,611
Now this is where you leverage working very closely with other stakeholders within the

312
00:14:16,631 --> 00:14:16,911
company.

313
00:14:17,719 --> 00:14:25,605
Based on the analysis, the business performance managers projected there would be a 15% drop in revenue if we do not push for this fix.

314
00:14:26,206 --> 00:14:27,266
And this helped turn the tide.

315
00:14:27,787 --> 00:14:30,049
The product saw that this is a strong case for UX revamp.

316
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,750
Yeah, the money really talks.

317
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,491
That got them sorted.

318
00:14:34,192 --> 00:14:39,616
And the devs also understood that it's important, but we have to be very smart and efficient about carrying out any changes.

319
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:44,053
Now perhaps you can understand why it was important

320
00:14:44,073 --> 00:14:45,094
to get a stakeholder buy-in,

321
00:14:45,654 --> 00:14:48,336
because I'm not free to design just any solution

322
00:14:48,796 --> 00:14:50,337
that might be so expensive to build

323
00:14:50,637 --> 00:14:52,758
that it will never see the light of day.

324
00:14:53,798 --> 00:14:55,679
Instead, the solution I needed to design

325
00:14:55,959 --> 00:14:57,340
had to hit three distinct goals.

326
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,241
Business goals of increasing player participation rate

327
00:15:00,622 --> 00:15:02,803
and boosting ROI, user experience goals

328
00:15:02,883 --> 00:15:04,043
of reducing cognitive load

329
00:15:04,243 --> 00:15:06,525
and making the whole experience feel more rewarding,

330
00:15:07,085 --> 00:15:08,365
and of course, the development goal

331
00:15:08,526 --> 00:15:10,426
of working within strict budget constraints.

332
00:15:12,469 --> 00:15:13,770
So now we have a green light.

333
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:15,571
The first thing I like to do afterwards

334
00:15:16,692 --> 00:15:17,712
in order to start on a solution

335
00:15:17,912 --> 00:15:19,373
is to look at the root cause of the problem.

336
00:15:20,334 --> 00:15:23,235
Even before I consider wireframes or hierarchy issues,

337
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,617
the first thing I start with is the logic flows.

338
00:15:26,697 --> 00:15:28,318
This is the existing event logic in our game.

339
00:15:28,798 --> 00:15:30,059
Is there a new event available?

340
00:15:30,419 --> 00:15:33,061
If yes, show player a new notification on HUD.

341
00:15:33,561 --> 00:15:35,762
If player signs up, maintain the new notification.

342
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:39,284
If not, just show him the remaining time.

343
00:15:40,425 --> 00:15:40,545
Now...

344
00:15:41,214 --> 00:15:43,415
You may well recall when we were applying heuristic diagnosis,

345
00:15:43,555 --> 00:15:46,397
I did point out for a game like ours, which has been live for long,

346
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:50,640
anytime the player comes back to the game, he has five to six notifications

347
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,042
waiting for his attention. And we deduced it is possible

348
00:15:54,462 --> 00:15:57,665
that this information that a new event is available might be getting drowned.

349
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:02,268
Or it may be the player is so used to the notification spam, he just treats it

350
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:06,811
as white noise and blanks it out. Either ways, the discovery of this system

351
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:10,733
is suffering. So what did we do? We added another step.

352
00:16:11,613 --> 00:16:13,675
trigger an event sign-up UI at launch.

353
00:16:14,275 --> 00:16:16,857
Now, whenever a new event is available,

354
00:16:17,218 --> 00:16:18,339
we trigger a sign-up UI.

355
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:21,341
What that does is it allows player to sign up for the event

356
00:16:21,582 --> 00:16:23,483
without going through any further drill downs

357
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:25,105
if he so wishes to.

358
00:16:26,126 --> 00:16:26,806
What did we boost?

359
00:16:27,467 --> 00:16:28,568
We added discovery.

360
00:16:29,909 --> 00:16:31,390
Instead of making player work

361
00:16:31,931 --> 00:16:34,213
to discover a critical piece of information

362
00:16:34,873 --> 00:16:35,994
that you want him to consume,

363
00:16:36,515 --> 00:16:39,017
we have surfaced and brought forth that information for him.

364
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:43,387
The next flow I looked at was the existing event over logic.

365
00:16:44,048 --> 00:16:46,130
Did player make any progress after signing up?

366
00:16:46,651 --> 00:16:49,814
If yes, display x reward value based on progression.

367
00:16:50,555 --> 00:16:51,756
If not, show a null value.

368
00:16:53,158 --> 00:16:56,121
Now a lot of my programmer friends would say, what's wrong with this logic?

369
00:16:56,601 --> 00:16:57,322
Makes sense, right?

370
00:16:57,542 --> 00:17:00,886
If the player did not make any progress, he would see a null reward value.

371
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:06,116
But what I would like to argue is while the logic is spot on, from a neuropsychological

372
00:17:06,176 --> 00:17:10,938
point of view, we are dealing with a very casual player base, a lot of teen and tween

373
00:17:11,018 --> 00:17:15,819
players, and when we show them a reward screen, they're expecting positive gratification.

374
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:17,480
So what did we do?

375
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:21,361
We added another step, display minimum participation reward.

376
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:26,542
Now, even if the player does not make any progress after signing up, we still give him

377
00:17:26,742 --> 00:17:27,883
a small participation reward.

378
00:17:29,133 --> 00:17:31,015
What did we change compared to the previous flow?

379
00:17:31,395 --> 00:17:32,456
We added empathy.

380
00:17:33,356 --> 00:17:36,138
What this does is it makes us, the developers, look generous

381
00:17:36,398 --> 00:17:38,540
and shows players there is a positive incentive

382
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,241
in taking part in the event system.

383
00:17:41,702 --> 00:17:43,883
So the two key changes we achieved in our logic flows,

384
00:17:44,283 --> 00:17:47,125
we boosted discovery by triggering a sign-up UI at launch

385
00:17:47,265 --> 00:17:48,446
whenever a new event is available,

386
00:17:48,886 --> 00:17:51,148
and we added empathy by giving players

387
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:52,448
a minimum participation reward.

388
00:17:53,929 --> 00:17:54,910
The next step was, of course,

389
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:57,131
to do some whiteboarding sessions, some brainstorming.

390
00:17:58,492 --> 00:18:00,394
along with your game designers, producers,

391
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:01,735
and all the other parties involved.

392
00:18:02,015 --> 00:18:03,356
We created some rough wireframes.

393
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:04,938
Once we were happy with those,

394
00:18:05,138 --> 00:18:06,480
we created digital counterparts.

395
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,262
And after we've iterated enough on these,

396
00:18:09,503 --> 00:18:10,944
we created a working prototype.

397
00:18:12,185 --> 00:18:14,467
So let's see, what did we change in the new flow

398
00:18:14,728 --> 00:18:16,550
in order to address all the issues

399
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:19,052
that we saw during the heuristic diagnosis stage?

400
00:18:20,673 --> 00:18:22,314
Now when the player clicks on the event icon,

401
00:18:22,655 --> 00:18:23,535
he's brought to this view.

402
00:18:23,856 --> 00:18:26,097
You can see that each event is now its own bucket

403
00:18:26,698 --> 00:18:27,659
using a tabular system.

404
00:18:28,099 --> 00:18:29,580
We rearrange the information hierarchy

405
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,442
so it's easier to read from top to bottom

406
00:18:31,522 --> 00:18:32,223
and left to right.

407
00:18:32,983 --> 00:18:36,226
And leaderboards is now a smart slide-in slide-out drawer.

408
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:39,149
What this does is, this layout allows the player

409
00:18:39,189 --> 00:18:41,751
to gather all the risk and reward information he needs

410
00:18:42,071 --> 00:18:44,693
within the very same view without switch of context

411
00:18:45,174 --> 00:18:47,476
and it reduces the number of drill downs

412
00:18:47,576 --> 00:18:49,117
from three to just one.

413
00:18:50,089 --> 00:18:52,510
So the key changes we achieved in our new flow,

414
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:54,770
we rearranged information hierarchy

415
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:55,851
so it's easier to digest,

416
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:58,572
we reduced drill downs from three to just one click,

417
00:18:59,032 --> 00:19:01,412
leaderboard is now a smart slide-in slide-out drawer,

418
00:19:02,033 --> 00:19:03,453
and we reduced cognitive load

419
00:19:03,593 --> 00:19:06,034
because we got rid of all the drill downs altogether.

420
00:19:07,854 --> 00:19:10,515
So, we have a solution now, which looks pretty good.

421
00:19:10,895 --> 00:19:14,276
The next step, as per UX methodology, is to test it.

422
00:19:16,097 --> 00:19:18,077
Now you would ask, why should we test it?

423
00:19:18,097 --> 00:19:19,758
We have tested it enough among ourselves, right?

424
00:19:21,608 --> 00:19:25,672
I would like to highlight the mindset with which the designers used to work earlier was

425
00:19:25,712 --> 00:19:27,573
about design for people.

426
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:31,776
And I say I'm not the kind of designer who designs for people.

427
00:19:32,757 --> 00:19:34,198
You might find that controversial, right?

428
00:19:34,879 --> 00:19:36,240
After all UX is all about people.

429
00:19:38,702 --> 00:19:40,683
Let me like expand on it a bit more.

430
00:19:41,844 --> 00:19:44,266
When designers earlier used to say we are designing for people.

431
00:19:45,118 --> 00:19:46,780
They are making all sorts of assumptions.

432
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,601
Yes, this is what the players will like.

433
00:19:48,701 --> 00:19:50,082
Yes, that is what the players would like.

434
00:19:50,402 --> 00:19:52,043
Or they might ask a few people around them,

435
00:19:52,623 --> 00:19:53,884
and that gave them the idea,

436
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:56,346
OK, design for people, I know what they want.

437
00:19:57,106 --> 00:19:59,488
But still, they're working just on assumptions.

438
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:05,131
Instead, UX as a methodology promotes for designing with people.

439
00:20:05,472 --> 00:20:09,054
And that is where focus group testing and usability testing come into play.

440
00:20:10,117 --> 00:20:12,517
Now normally you would go for a full-blown usability test,

441
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:14,958
but since we were pressed for time, we did the next best thing,

442
00:20:15,198 --> 00:20:17,839
and that was a focus group testing session within the company.

443
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,901
Luckily, in a studio like ours, we had three different teams

444
00:20:21,981 --> 00:20:23,241
working on three different projects.

445
00:20:23,602 --> 00:20:25,682
That meant we had a pool of players who did not know

446
00:20:25,722 --> 00:20:27,983
what's happening much in other teams' project.

447
00:20:28,383 --> 00:20:32,065
So we had a perfect pool of players who could give us unbiased reviews.

448
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:35,906
We tested our prototype with them, we got some positive feedback,

449
00:20:36,306 --> 00:20:38,507
and on basis of that, this solution was greenlighted.

450
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,662
The next step was, of course, to work with the UI designer on this project and the front-end

451
00:20:43,722 --> 00:20:48,463
engineers in order to make sure justice is done to our vision and to solve any UX problems

452
00:20:48,623 --> 00:20:50,484
we may encounter while implementing it.

453
00:20:52,024 --> 00:20:57,406
Happy to say we managed to push this update out on time with this new fix, and we were

454
00:20:57,666 --> 00:21:00,067
all very pleasantly surprised with what happened next.

455
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:06,215
This new update not only managed to meet the launch KPI of 45%,

456
00:21:06,656 --> 00:21:08,298
but within a small window of time,

457
00:21:08,578 --> 00:21:13,404
we saw the engagement rate go all the way from 20% to 80%,

458
00:21:13,684 --> 00:21:17,889
which was a humongous 300% jump compared to the previous update.

459
00:21:19,471 --> 00:21:20,853
Important thing here to remember is.

460
00:21:21,684 --> 00:21:24,706
without redesigning or rehauling the entire event system

461
00:21:25,366 --> 00:21:27,228
or writing copious amount of new code,

462
00:21:27,868 --> 00:21:29,870
just by applying the correct UX methodology

463
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:31,811
in not only diagnosing the problem,

464
00:21:32,191 --> 00:21:33,673
but also designing a solution

465
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:35,354
which resonated with our player base,

466
00:21:35,754 --> 00:21:38,436
we were able to have such a huge impact on our KPIs.

467
00:21:40,097 --> 00:21:41,138
Next, there was a debrief session

468
00:21:41,438 --> 00:21:42,839
and we had some clear-cut takeaways.

469
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,782
Do not create unnecessary choice biases.

470
00:21:46,462 --> 00:21:49,284
Do not overhelm the player with too much information.

471
00:21:49,785 --> 00:21:50,405
Boost discovery.

472
00:21:51,974 --> 00:21:55,796
If there is a critical piece of information you want players to see or interact with,

473
00:21:55,937 --> 00:21:58,478
do not bury it, do not make them work to discover it.

474
00:21:58,718 --> 00:22:00,980
Instead, surface and bring it forth for them.

475
00:22:02,285 --> 00:22:04,606
Show empathy and use reward screens to convert players.

476
00:22:05,247 --> 00:22:07,188
This is interesting because after we added

477
00:22:07,328 --> 00:22:08,889
the minimum participation reward,

478
00:22:09,449 --> 00:22:11,450
we saw that a huge chunk of players

479
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,671
who were just early signing up,

480
00:22:12,951 --> 00:22:14,092
but not making any progress,

481
00:22:14,752 --> 00:22:16,713
saw a positive incentive in taking part

482
00:22:16,853 --> 00:22:18,374
and started interacting with the system.

483
00:22:18,815 --> 00:22:21,136
And this partly led to the huge 300% jump

484
00:22:21,276 --> 00:22:22,317
you saw in the previous slide.

485
00:22:23,597 --> 00:22:25,358
Last but not least, leverage data.

486
00:22:25,859 --> 00:22:28,500
Work very closely with other departments within the company.

487
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:31,863
Because not only will they help you gather qualitative

488
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:34,684
and quantitative data to diagnose a issue,

489
00:22:34,984 --> 00:22:37,965
but when the time comes to make a push for the UX fix

490
00:22:38,505 --> 00:22:39,585
in front of the stakeholder group,

491
00:22:39,785 --> 00:22:41,186
they'll be there backing you up,

492
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:42,986
helping you make a stronger case.

493
00:22:44,547 --> 00:22:45,727
So with that, ladies and gentlemen,

494
00:22:45,907 --> 00:22:47,268
we've come to an end of our presentation.

495
00:22:47,288 --> 00:22:49,069
I hope it was informative.

496
00:22:49,849 --> 00:22:52,150
And the floor is now open for questions, I guess.

497
00:23:00,104 --> 00:23:02,316
In case you have any questions, please come forward to the mic.

498
00:23:11,885 --> 00:23:14,527
Hi, I'm James Berg, researcher with EA.

499
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:16,368
Great presentation, thank you.

500
00:23:16,608 --> 00:23:18,529
You mentioned for this particular example,

501
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,791
you're under some pretty severe time constraints.

502
00:23:21,271 --> 00:23:23,593
So I'm wondering, what would you approach differently

503
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:25,775
if you had all the time that you,

504
00:23:25,815 --> 00:23:26,975
well, maybe not all the time you wanted,

505
00:23:27,015 --> 00:23:29,457
but a realistic amount of extra time added?

506
00:23:29,537 --> 00:23:30,458
What would you have done differently

507
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:32,059
to approach solving the UX problems?

508
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:33,934
That's a very good question, in fact.

509
00:23:34,615 --> 00:23:36,656
Yeah, so there's a contrasting methodology

510
00:23:36,676 --> 00:23:37,457
that you have to apply.

511
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:39,759
If I had more time, a reasonable amount of time,

512
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:41,780
let's say with UX built in,

513
00:23:42,441 --> 00:23:44,382
what we would do is ideally we would like to get

514
00:23:44,462 --> 00:23:47,825
players' eyes on the prototype much earlier.

515
00:23:49,299 --> 00:23:51,419
We will not say we have something, we are okay with it.

516
00:23:51,459 --> 00:23:53,260
We will do a proper thorough survey.

517
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,960
And afterwards, once it's designed,

518
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,580
as I mentioned, because we were pressed for time,

519
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:57,881
we did a focus group testing session.

520
00:23:57,901 --> 00:23:59,621
So briefly, I'll just expand on that.

521
00:24:00,201 --> 00:24:03,122
Focus group testing session done with six to eight people

522
00:24:03,762 --> 00:24:06,163
within your company is not as informative

523
00:24:06,383 --> 00:24:08,183
as a usability test session.

524
00:24:08,583 --> 00:24:09,443
In a usability session,

525
00:24:09,524 --> 00:24:11,284
you can have actual real world players,

526
00:24:11,404 --> 00:24:12,884
you can invite them from outside,

527
00:24:13,464 --> 00:24:16,745
and you can observe how they're playing the game.

528
00:24:17,717 --> 00:24:24,507
What you get is a goldmine of information, which is much more reliable and much more

529
00:24:24,547 --> 00:24:28,032
solid to work with, rather than coming up with something just for the sake of it.

530
00:24:28,653 --> 00:24:31,898
Both solutions are effective, but I would always prefer having more time beforehand.

531
00:24:35,442 --> 00:24:42,705
You mentioned that you're adding this after launch, and that can be really challenging to get something in and change an existing system.

532
00:24:42,905 --> 00:24:49,889
Did you have any resistance to adding things that were changing an existing system?

533
00:24:50,249 --> 00:24:55,911
Was there anything you did to lubricate that process to make it easier for players to understand the change?

534
00:24:58,299 --> 00:24:59,520
Could you repeat that question?

535
00:25:00,321 --> 00:25:00,701
Yeah.

536
00:25:01,923 --> 00:25:05,907
Was there anything that you had to do in designing the system to make it so that

537
00:25:05,927 --> 00:25:09,952
players who were already familiar with the old system were easily able to

538
00:25:10,012 --> 00:25:11,173
transition to the new system?

539
00:25:11,694 --> 00:25:11,934
Yeah.

540
00:25:11,954 --> 00:25:13,256
So, so again, yeah, you're right.

541
00:25:13,336 --> 00:25:14,657
So what you normally do is you.

542
00:25:15,493 --> 00:25:17,534
trigger something called a modular fatui, right?

543
00:25:18,175 --> 00:25:20,496
And if you notice, this layout was not

544
00:25:20,657 --> 00:25:22,018
that far from the previous one.

545
00:25:22,338 --> 00:25:23,739
It's just that we cleaned it up, we

546
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:26,141
made it much easier to switch between even types,

547
00:25:26,641 --> 00:25:29,723
and the only biggest addition was the smart slide

548
00:25:29,743 --> 00:25:30,384
and slide or draw.

549
00:25:30,804 --> 00:25:31,985
So for that, we utilized something

550
00:25:32,005 --> 00:25:34,346
called a modular fatui, which is triggered first time the players

551
00:25:34,386 --> 00:25:35,367
come into the tutorial.

552
00:25:35,747 --> 00:25:38,209
And since it was a much easier system to interact with,

553
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:39,630
it was a hit with them.

554
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:41,111
Thanks.

555
00:25:47,361 --> 00:25:47,903
All right.

556
00:25:48,705 --> 00:25:51,013
So guys, this looks like we don't have any more questions.

557
00:25:51,274 --> 00:25:51,836
Thank you very much.
