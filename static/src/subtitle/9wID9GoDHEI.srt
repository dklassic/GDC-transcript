1
00:00:05,289 --> 00:00:09,694
This is VR Events, Do's and Don'ts for making great first impressions.

2
00:00:09,814 --> 00:00:10,755
Thanks so much for joining us.

3
00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:13,598
I'm Melissa Swanepoel, COO at Farbridge Incorporated.

4
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:14,960
And I'm Patrick Curry.

5
00:00:15,881 --> 00:00:19,465
And together we run a studio in Austin, Texas called Farbridge.

6
00:00:19,505 --> 00:00:20,766
We're an interactive studio.

7
00:00:20,786 --> 00:00:23,669
We do a lot of work in virtual reality, augmented reality,

8
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,012
and through that also a lot of events.

9
00:00:27,274 --> 00:00:30,736
We've put together a bunch of apps and we've realized that through doing this and showing

10
00:00:30,756 --> 00:00:34,819
them to people that we've spent about the same amount of time showcasing and refining

11
00:00:35,059 --> 00:00:38,441
our showing off techniques as we have putting the apps together, making sure they're polished

12
00:00:38,461 --> 00:00:39,362
and ready for eyes.

13
00:00:39,582 --> 00:00:43,464
And so one of those was Masterworks Journey Through History, which takes research fidelity

14
00:00:43,504 --> 00:00:50,709
data of climate-impacted sites and makes it available to explore in VR via field trips.

15
00:00:51,773 --> 00:00:58,379
We did something very similar called My Virtual Armenia for the Smithsonian Institute and their Folklife Festival with our content partner, SciArk.

16
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:11,370
And we also created a very realistic, scientifically accurate simulation of brains inserted into robotic jar bodies doing battle on the surface of the moon called Jar Wars.

17
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:15,053
And it's a fun, silly, social multiplayer VR experience.

18
00:01:15,415 --> 00:01:19,278
We definitely did the research and this is definitely where we're headed as a society.

19
00:01:19,338 --> 00:01:21,220
So like, get ready. Start training today.

20
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:21,680
It's real.

21
00:01:23,982 --> 00:01:27,765
And we also created an augmented reality experience. This is called Sky Blitz.

22
00:01:28,285 --> 00:01:33,189
It's an AR football game that was shown off at a big, big sporting event last

23
00:01:33,669 --> 00:01:37,892
February in Atlanta, which we're not allowed to name for legal reasons.

24
00:01:40,424 --> 00:01:46,268
When we're not busy putting together apps and showing them to the public as branded experiences or special festival appearances,

25
00:01:46,749 --> 00:01:53,934
we run a little thing called VR Austin that is a community of VR developers and enthusiasts in Austin, Texas.

26
00:01:54,574 --> 00:02:00,578
We have quarterly meetups where people show up to demo their latest and greatest experiments, experiences, and games,

27
00:02:00,919 --> 00:02:02,019
and we throw a big party.

28
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:06,653
and basically let the public come in and try VR for the first time and we staff it with volunteers.

29
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:13,039
And then we also do the VR Austin gem, which is once a year we get a whole bunch of developers

30
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:17,264
together and we give them a weekend to put together their newest ideas and have some fun

31
00:02:18,025 --> 00:02:21,348
and at the end of it we show it off to a very very big party of people.

32
00:02:22,311 --> 00:02:23,852
And before this, we were prepping.

33
00:02:24,052 --> 00:02:28,116
We think we've helped give thousands of virtual reality

34
00:02:28,156 --> 00:02:29,817
demonstrations now, which is kind of crazy,

35
00:02:29,837 --> 00:02:33,180
but between the events that we've put on,

36
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,661
the software we've made,

37
00:02:34,781 --> 00:02:36,162
showing that software at different events,

38
00:02:37,563 --> 00:02:39,045
yeah, thousands of experiences.

39
00:02:39,065 --> 00:02:40,446
So we have our process down.

40
00:02:40,486 --> 00:02:41,406
It's fairly honed.

41
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:43,068
We're excited to share these tips with you.

42
00:02:43,108 --> 00:02:44,749
So some of the events that we've shown at

43
00:02:44,809 --> 00:02:46,511
is the Folklife Festival with the Smithsonian,

44
00:02:47,231 --> 00:02:49,413
RTX, and Fantastic Arcade in Austin, Texas.

45
00:02:50,094 --> 00:02:51,675
South by Southwest, also in Austin.

46
00:02:52,395 --> 00:02:55,777
And we premiered masterworks on the Oculus Go at F8.

47
00:02:56,398 --> 00:03:00,160
Yes. And so through doing all of these experiences with lots of people,

48
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,082
we've learned many of the hard lessons, sometimes repeatedly.

49
00:03:03,643 --> 00:03:07,005
And now we're here to share what we found so that you don't have to do what we did.

50
00:03:07,265 --> 00:03:08,226
Mostly repeatedly.

51
00:03:10,448 --> 00:03:17,955
So, you know, one of our big conclusions is that virtual reality is still really best experienced and shown in person, right?

52
00:03:18,856 --> 00:03:22,379
It's not just one person at home playing a game alone.

53
00:03:22,399 --> 00:03:27,424
A lot of people have their first, their very first virtual reality experiences out in public.

54
00:03:27,464 --> 00:03:28,725
It could be at an event like this.

55
00:03:28,765 --> 00:03:30,506
It could be a showcase, an arcade.

56
00:03:31,607 --> 00:03:34,969
And you know, my complaint and beef there is that VR is just still too expensive.

57
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:35,810
And people come up to me and say,

58
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,672
Hey Patrick, virtual reality sounds awesome. How do I get into it?

59
00:03:39,072 --> 00:03:43,755
There's like a half hour conversation about budgets and technologies and all of that about what to experience.

60
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:47,658
Whereas I can just be like, hey, go to this place, do this virtual reality here at this event.

61
00:03:48,178 --> 00:03:52,461
And so all of us as an industry want that to be the best possible first experience.

62
00:03:52,521 --> 00:03:55,363
We don't want to turn people off from this medium, this technology, this industry.

63
00:03:55,803 --> 00:03:58,645
We want to invite as many people into it, both as, you know.

64
00:03:59,255 --> 00:04:01,759
Consumers, but more importantly, as creators and collaborators.

65
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,165
And so we think that these live events are a best place to do it.

66
00:04:05,285 --> 00:04:08,771
It's a social experience, you can share photos, memories, and

67
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:09,913
also just have a laugh with people.

68
00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:12,518
And that helps cement it as a positive experience with each other.

69
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:19,413
Because it's such a far-reaching experience, you can no longer consider just one person,

70
00:04:19,473 --> 00:04:22,497
the player, at the end of the long development cycle, like,

71
00:04:22,617 --> 00:04:24,120
ah, yes, we must please this one person.

72
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,466
You are thinking of multiple audiences, and you have to consider all of their needs, desires,

73
00:04:28,506 --> 00:04:30,248
and what shows well to them.

74
00:04:31,249 --> 00:04:35,653
So with a VR experience, your first concentric circle of the audience is the person who's playing it.

75
00:04:36,914 --> 00:04:40,197
The next one out, the next closest to that experience, are people who are standing in

76
00:04:40,217 --> 00:04:44,441
line. They've already opted into your experience, you've sold them, they're ready to wait and spend

77
00:04:44,461 --> 00:04:49,466
their time with you. Beyond that is the audience who's maybe walking past that line and then they

78
00:04:49,526 --> 00:04:53,329
see this long line and their interest is piqued and now they slow down and they're watching and

79
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:54,851
you want to make sure that you have something.

80
00:04:55,311 --> 00:04:59,833
of interest for them. Beyond the in-person audience, they're live streamers. If people

81
00:04:59,853 --> 00:05:04,794
are walking around with their live stream camera going or they're digitally streaming a conference,

82
00:05:05,295 --> 00:05:08,656
you want to make sure that the content is accessible and attractive to those audiences.

83
00:05:09,056 --> 00:05:14,158
And then beyond that, even further, is the digital footprint of this experience on the internet.

84
00:05:14,638 --> 00:05:18,280
Blogs, write-ups, photo galleries, clips, GIFs.

85
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,760
You want to make sure that the things that you are putting out there

86
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,141
are very easy for all of the basically amateur

87
00:05:25,202 --> 00:05:28,262
advertisements and photographers that all of the audience with a phone is.

88
00:05:28,383 --> 00:05:29,123
Like all of them.

89
00:05:29,263 --> 00:05:32,424
You want to make sure that it's easy for them to capture it and show off your best side.

90
00:05:33,064 --> 00:05:36,105
Our friend Wiley, who's put on Fantastic Arcade for many years,

91
00:05:36,565 --> 00:05:37,665
said something very astute. He said,

92
00:05:38,225 --> 00:05:39,646
if it's not on YouTube, it didn't happen.

93
00:05:40,255 --> 00:05:48,744
And so we kind of think about that as being one of the end products of this virtual reality experience is a 2D video of people doing it that lives on the internet forever.

94
00:05:50,656 --> 00:05:57,702
So with that in mind, there are these three sort of big facets of a show to design, and particularly the app that you're bringing to that show.

95
00:05:58,022 --> 00:06:03,066
The very first part is the virtual reality software. This is what is happening inside the headset to that person's brain.

96
00:06:03,627 --> 00:06:09,352
The second part is the physical space setup. This sort of straddles the inside-outside headset divide,

97
00:06:09,432 --> 00:06:13,695
because a lot of what your physical space is going to impact is going to change how that person can

98
00:06:13,735 --> 00:06:15,977
behave in the virtual reality experience or the...

99
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:21,244
AR, XR, MR experience, and also how they're going to be impacted physically in the real world.

100
00:06:21,765 --> 00:06:24,786
And then the emotional experience happens primarily out of the headset.

101
00:06:24,886 --> 00:06:29,988
Once that person has waited in line and they've been set up to enjoy the experience afterwards,

102
00:06:30,108 --> 00:06:34,430
what is their emotional takeaway? Because that lasts so much longer than the facts of the experience.

103
00:06:36,531 --> 00:06:41,013
So first we'd like to talk about this notion of the virtual experience and how we design it.

104
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:47,652
So just like how I'm a big believer that in-person experiences are some of the best ways to experience VR,

105
00:06:47,672 --> 00:06:52,874
the opposite side of that experience is that almost everyone is new to VR.

106
00:06:52,894 --> 00:06:56,115
The people who are going to come to an event or wait in line especially

107
00:06:56,355 --> 00:06:58,235
are the people who are most hungry for virtual reality.

108
00:06:58,255 --> 00:07:01,076
That often means that they have the least prior experience with it, right?

109
00:07:01,476 --> 00:07:04,817
If you're Daniel and you have six headsets at home, you're probably not going to wait in line.

110
00:07:06,078 --> 00:07:09,679
So we try to think about the absolute broadest experience we can

111
00:07:10,239 --> 00:07:11,399
and make sure that our experiences are.

112
00:07:11,659 --> 00:07:14,380
easy to use, and also easy to make look good.

113
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,521
Because, you know, we're keeping in mind not just the player,

114
00:07:17,561 --> 00:07:19,142
but also everyone else watching them.

115
00:07:19,762 --> 00:07:21,563
And so we try to include ideas or mechanics

116
00:07:21,943 --> 00:07:23,343
that make it easy for them to have fun

117
00:07:23,623 --> 00:07:25,124
and also easy for them to show it off.

118
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:27,765
Like, let's give them lots of guides and lots of helping hands

119
00:07:27,805 --> 00:07:29,005
within the VR experience

120
00:07:29,626 --> 00:07:31,506
so that they can show it off to other novices

121
00:07:31,566 --> 00:07:33,887
who are there at the event waiting to participate.

122
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:39,024
Even if the player is not hitting your win case in the demo or the game itself, they

123
00:07:39,044 --> 00:07:42,987
should have fun while failing and still come back and be like, no, I want to wait in line

124
00:07:43,027 --> 00:07:43,748
again and I want to try.

125
00:07:43,768 --> 00:07:45,510
This time I figured out what I should be doing.

126
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:48,132
Or like, hey, I totally just flailed around.

127
00:07:48,152 --> 00:07:51,355
I have no idea what I was supposed to be doing, but I had fun doing it.

128
00:07:51,395 --> 00:07:54,358
I'm going to tell my friends about how cool VR is, how cool this app is.

129
00:07:56,368 --> 00:08:00,970
So another way to make sure that you're going to be generating more and more good experiences

130
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,991
from your showcase is to keep it short and sweet.

131
00:08:03,831 --> 00:08:08,233
We try to average less than 10 minutes, and that's not just time in the experience, that's

132
00:08:08,293 --> 00:08:11,454
including the getting people into VR and back out of it.

133
00:08:11,474 --> 00:08:14,896
So our turnaround times are between 7 and 8 minutes on show floors.

134
00:08:15,676 --> 00:08:20,160
The more physical your VR experience is, or your AR experience, your XR, all of the Rs,

135
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,221
the shorter your session should be.

136
00:08:22,341 --> 00:08:27,546
And that's because if you're out there and you're punching and fighting and jumping and dodging and all these things,

137
00:08:27,786 --> 00:08:30,708
at the end of it, your muscles are sore, you're sweaty, you're out of breath.

138
00:08:31,068 --> 00:08:34,591
You want to make sure that people are leaving your experience energized and hyped,

139
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:39,415
and maybe a little bit out of breath, but you can go on and talk to your friends about how cool it was

140
00:08:39,475 --> 00:08:42,998
and not need to go sit down for half an hour and maybe miss the next cool thing that you wanted to see.

141
00:08:44,668 --> 00:08:48,269
Look for example to Beat Saber, where most of the songs are under or at three minutes.

142
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:53,370
That's a pretty ideal cutoff point for something that's hyper, hyper physical.

143
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:57,371
And another thing about shorter experiences is that the line keeps moving.

144
00:08:57,411 --> 00:09:00,752
So hopefully you have a long line full of eager people ready to play your experience,

145
00:09:01,152 --> 00:09:03,333
try your app, or even just see what it's about.

146
00:09:03,873 --> 00:09:06,373
The shorter the line, or the faster the line is moving.

147
00:09:06,974 --> 00:09:18,435
The better, and you're moving more people through and you're giving the audience who's watching this line move really quickly chances to say yes to, I do want to get into this experience, I'm not going to be in line for 45 minutes, and I will have a good time coming out of it.

148
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:25,724
Yeah, so another phenomenon we've seen with these experiences is that sometimes people have a bad time in virtual reality.

149
00:09:25,945 --> 00:09:28,247
Sometimes they're not comfortable standing for a long period of time.

150
00:09:28,648 --> 00:09:31,531
Sometimes they get motion sick, or sometimes there's just a technical malfunction.

151
00:09:31,891 --> 00:09:33,053
Those things, it just happens.

152
00:09:33,653 --> 00:09:38,519
The interesting phenomenon has been that no one tells us until after the demo is over.

153
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:40,199
We say, oh, how was it?

154
00:09:40,219 --> 00:09:41,880
They're like, oh, it's horrible.

155
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,780
I got super sick.

156
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,101
We're like, why didn't you tell us?

157
00:09:44,141 --> 00:09:47,042
And there's something about putting on the virtual reality

158
00:09:47,062 --> 00:09:48,262
headset and stepping into that world

159
00:09:48,702 --> 00:09:51,723
that I think people are less likely to complain or just opt

160
00:09:51,803 --> 00:09:51,903
out.

161
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:54,784
So if you have a nice, short, concise demo,

162
00:09:55,324 --> 00:09:57,465
you're minimizing how long a bad experience is.

163
00:09:58,005 --> 00:09:59,505
And people who really enjoy the experience are saying,

164
00:09:59,525 --> 00:09:59,885
hey, you know what?

165
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:00,686
No sweat.

166
00:10:00,826 --> 00:10:01,366
Glad you enjoyed it.

167
00:10:01,526 --> 00:10:02,806
You can get back in line and do it again.

168
00:10:02,826 --> 00:10:04,807
There's sort of just an interesting phenomenon

169
00:10:04,847 --> 00:10:05,287
about people.

170
00:10:05,887 --> 00:10:08,888
Just not complaining. I mean, it's cool that people love virtual reality.

171
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:11,029
There's so much like, yeah, I got to try it. Totally suck.

172
00:10:11,049 --> 00:10:12,490
But, you know, I got to try it.

173
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,991
So, again, keep your experiences short.

174
00:10:17,512 --> 00:10:19,513
Another way to make sure that as many people are going to enjoy

175
00:10:19,553 --> 00:10:21,914
your experience as possible is by designing for inclusivity.

176
00:10:22,314 --> 00:10:25,575
One of the easiest things that you can do to make your experience

177
00:10:25,675 --> 00:10:28,657
broadly accessible is by implementing ambidextrous controls,

178
00:10:29,137 --> 00:10:32,738
just by making it so that a person only has to have the use of one hand to

179
00:10:33,542 --> 00:10:37,086
Like, explore the full functionality and creativity of your app

180
00:10:37,466 --> 00:10:40,209
means that you're opening it up to a broader swath of people.

181
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:43,533
You also want to consider players of multiple sizes and heights.

182
00:10:44,073 --> 00:10:47,237
You want to make sure that you're not balancing the game for somebody who's very short

183
00:10:47,317 --> 00:10:49,159
and then tall people will be left with no cover

184
00:10:49,579 --> 00:10:51,661
or somebody who's really tall can just look over everything.

185
00:10:51,701 --> 00:10:54,765
We have a... we actually have a co-worker who's incredibly tall

186
00:10:54,825 --> 00:10:55,726
and will sometimes just go...

187
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:01,271
and then just get you. And it's like, okay, that has to be balanced for player height so that

188
00:11:01,731 --> 00:11:05,833
everybody is on a more even playing field and it's accessible for folks of different sizes and heights.

189
00:11:07,153 --> 00:11:12,075
Another easy, easy win is standing and seated play options. Making this available to people

190
00:11:12,195 --> 00:11:17,417
will encourage others to opt into your experience at show floors, particularly if you're tired,

191
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:20,418
it's the end of the day, you just want to sit down, but you still want to see the thing,

192
00:11:20,758 --> 00:11:23,939
but maybe you don't feel like ducking and jumping and like turning around a bunch of times,

193
00:11:24,439 --> 00:11:25,539
make seated play an option.

194
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,700
And then of course, swipe to turn is an alternative to room scale.

195
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,961
It's important, particularly if you have seated play,

196
00:11:31,281 --> 00:11:33,302
because then you are not forcing people to do this

197
00:11:35,102 --> 00:11:36,463
multiple times during gameplay.

198
00:11:36,603 --> 00:11:39,363
And that is a really painful maneuver to do with a sore back

199
00:11:39,403 --> 00:11:41,684
from loading in and out show floor events.

200
00:11:41,864 --> 00:11:43,785
And also if you have any spinal column trauma.

201
00:11:46,614 --> 00:11:49,697
So another favorite accessibility feature of ours is reach assist.

202
00:11:50,318 --> 00:11:54,101
So, uh, what we implemented in Jar Wars and have since taken to our other

203
00:11:54,121 --> 00:11:58,266
experiences is that we don't make the player move within arm's reach to grab

204
00:11:58,306 --> 00:11:58,566
something.

205
00:11:58,946 --> 00:12:02,249
Basically if you can see it and you hold your hand out towards it and you press a

206
00:12:02,269 --> 00:12:03,691
grab button, you're going to grab the object.

207
00:12:04,237 --> 00:12:08,503
And we do that in the fiction of Jar Wars, where you have an extendo, like Inspector Gadget,

208
00:12:08,543 --> 00:12:10,806
robotic arm that zooms out and grabs something and pulls it back.

209
00:12:10,826 --> 00:12:13,269
But it has tons of great side effects.

210
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:15,793
Players aren't busy fiddling with movement,

211
00:12:15,813 --> 00:12:18,176
trying to get close enough to something, but not too close.

212
00:12:19,297 --> 00:12:22,819
Also, as a developer, I appreciate it because I don't have to actually bend down all the way over

213
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:26,120
to pick up physics objects off the floor in virtual reality all the time.

214
00:12:27,141 --> 00:12:30,542
And it's very intuitive for players. Players understand, they hold their hand towards something,

215
00:12:30,802 --> 00:12:34,404
it lights up, they're going to grab it. And there's lots of ways to explain that in your fiction.

216
00:12:34,464 --> 00:12:38,345
It could be, you know, like Magneto from X-Men, or The Force in Star Wars,

217
00:12:38,445 --> 00:12:42,227
or Akio Broom from Harry Potter. And so, whatever type of experience you're creating,

218
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:45,888
you can explain it. And we find if it's an app, like not a game, but just an app,

219
00:12:46,369 --> 00:12:48,971
People get it. I'm aiming at something, I click on it, I get it.

220
00:12:49,111 --> 00:12:51,734
And it just works. It doesn't take a ton of explanation.

221
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:55,838
Consumers understand it when you're trying to make it easier for them to use your app

222
00:12:55,918 --> 00:12:57,439
and interact with the items in it.

223
00:12:59,141 --> 00:13:00,963
The next part to consider is physical design.

224
00:13:01,203 --> 00:13:04,206
And that is the space and setup in general of all the technology

225
00:13:04,286 --> 00:13:06,608
that you're going to use to support this experience.

226
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:13,299
VR has pretty unique space needs, but so does AR depending on the app, MR depending on the app again.

227
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:21,026
So there's just tons of little things that you have to keep in mind as you're putting together your package of gear to take with to a venue.

228
00:13:21,326 --> 00:13:25,570
It's very nice to have a 10x10 cube to put people in and then they can...

229
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:28,613
Flail their arms and run around to their hearts content.

230
00:13:29,695 --> 00:13:41,829
But venues and sometimes show floors are very reticent to give you 40 by 10 square feet just for player space, and that's going to impact their branding, it's going to impact the number of vendors, the number of showcases that they can allow.

231
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:48,431
So, through a lot of repetitious trying and going to different venues and being told,

232
00:13:48,471 --> 00:13:52,492
hey, we told you you could have this much space, but we've changed it at the last minute,

233
00:13:52,772 --> 00:13:59,133
we found that we can get away with a 20 by 6 foot track space and put four players concurrently tracked within that.

234
00:13:59,653 --> 00:14:02,874
And that helps us keep our footprint down and that keeps venues pretty happy.

235
00:14:02,894 --> 00:14:08,255
Yeah, and that's in a single Vive lighthouse track space, which is pretty convenient.

236
00:14:11,253 --> 00:14:14,954
So also, it's important to remember that every venue has different physical setups,

237
00:14:15,014 --> 00:14:17,235
and so you're going to have to set up your tracking in different ways.

238
00:14:18,236 --> 00:14:21,657
And this is true whether you're using lighthouses, inside-out cameras,

239
00:14:23,058 --> 00:14:24,258
you know, outside-in cameras,

240
00:14:25,359 --> 00:14:28,000
windows, reflective surfaces, sunlight glare,

241
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,141
all of these things can interfere with your tracking.

242
00:14:31,688 --> 00:14:34,789
Ask him anything that he emits infrared.

243
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:37,851
So one of our coworkers had a Roomba in his house

244
00:14:37,891 --> 00:14:39,973
and he didn't realize it, but it was ruining his tracking

245
00:14:40,953 --> 00:14:42,874
while he was trying to play virtual reality.

246
00:14:43,214 --> 00:14:46,136
So he had to put the Roomba on timeout while he was playing VR.

247
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:50,079
So because it would just sort of sneak in and ruin the experience

248
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,400
and he'd come out of it and realize it would be gone by then.

249
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,200
It's like, what happened?

250
00:14:53,481 --> 00:14:54,161
What has occurred?

251
00:14:54,221 --> 00:14:56,783
And it's just this stealthy Roomba ruining things.

252
00:14:57,943 --> 00:15:03,264
And then of course, for any event venue, particularly if you've never been there before, you want to arrive early.

253
00:15:03,344 --> 00:15:08,546
If you're coming from out of state or out of city, you want to arrive at least a day early and get into the space,

254
00:15:08,706 --> 00:15:11,527
try to test your gear and test your app at the time of day.

255
00:15:11,547 --> 00:15:16,148
If you're going to have lots of crowds moving around, you may want to have a bunch of people walk back and forth

256
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:21,149
and see, like, some MR experiences are very good if the audience is sitting very still,

257
00:15:21,649 --> 00:15:24,570
but if there's a whole bunch of people milling back and forth, it can ruin the tracking.

258
00:15:25,811 --> 00:15:31,118
For AR experiences, we had a situation where we tested it during the day and it was great.

259
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:34,282
It was a rooftop balcony overlooking the city and it was lovely.

260
00:15:34,302 --> 00:15:36,765
I think it's aliens that you're shooting.

261
00:15:37,716 --> 00:15:41,397
And then at night when we were showing it, it still looked beautiful, it was still visible, it was great.

262
00:15:42,577 --> 00:15:47,259
But the traffic lights would change, and the cars, which emit bright lights, would just move.

263
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:51,361
And the app would just be like, that's my anchor, and drive down the street with folks.

264
00:15:51,481 --> 00:15:54,962
And so there was a tracking consideration we hadn't come across before.

265
00:15:55,082 --> 00:15:58,663
So there's plenty of things to find that might mess you up,

266
00:15:58,804 --> 00:16:01,645
and it helps you build a better app and a better showcase experience.

267
00:16:01,725 --> 00:16:04,086
If you keep a list of those, and you're like, have we considered this?

268
00:16:04,286 --> 00:16:06,587
Have we considered this? Have we considered this? We're good to go.

269
00:16:07,063 --> 00:16:09,172
Next time, we'll just cordon off the street and no traffic.

270
00:16:09,232 --> 00:16:11,722
Oh, yeah. Very easy to do that. Cities love it.

271
00:16:13,509 --> 00:16:17,950
So also you want to design for spectators in your physical space, right?

272
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:21,971
So we found that the best way to do that is lots of screens,

273
00:16:22,111 --> 00:16:25,391
the largest possible screens you can get here.

274
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:28,952
That's that photo is the Google Fiber Space in Austin, Texas.

275
00:16:29,092 --> 00:16:34,253
Lovely video wall on the back of a stage made for perfect VR demonstrations.

276
00:16:35,353 --> 00:16:39,194
And also we we connected a spectator view where it's a unique view.

277
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:44,397
of the action. You don't always want to put a first person view on a giant screen.

278
00:16:44,477 --> 00:16:47,078
That can be kind of motion sick inducing on its own.

279
00:16:47,718 --> 00:16:51,300
And so by putting a third person camera on a separate very large screen,

280
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,441
it's very easy for the audience to understand what's going on.

281
00:16:53,962 --> 00:16:56,963
But then you also want to design space in your physical layout

282
00:16:57,323 --> 00:16:59,585
for people to be able to watch it and see the screen.

283
00:17:00,405 --> 00:17:02,986
And also room for your videographers and photographers.

284
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:06,128
That's both the real-life people walking around taking photos and video,

285
00:17:06,588 --> 00:17:08,768
as well as, in this case, we had a virtual camera person.

286
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:12,070
So we had to like find a nook, it's like over hidden behind the stage,

287
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:15,691
for them to sit so they could actually pilot the spectator camera.

288
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:19,832
I think they ended up calling that the corner of shame just because it was so tucked away.

289
00:17:19,852 --> 00:17:23,774
I think it's where like normally set up like refuse and detritus ends up and it was just

290
00:17:23,794 --> 00:17:27,495
like nope that's where our fifth computer is with our person just slotted away.

291
00:17:31,013 --> 00:17:33,515
So, let's talk a little bit about the gear that we bring to events.

292
00:17:33,535 --> 00:17:34,615
So, we've learned the hard way.

293
00:17:35,756 --> 00:17:38,157
We always have to bring our own gear to events.

294
00:17:38,217 --> 00:17:40,939
So, that starts with our own computers and headsets,

295
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:43,740
upgrading to laptops from desktop PCs,

296
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,722
as you can imagine, a huge win, lots and lots of gear to carry,

297
00:17:46,762 --> 00:17:47,822
fewer things to lose or break.

298
00:17:49,503 --> 00:17:52,985
And the other thing we always bring is tons and tons of electrical gear and network gear.

299
00:17:53,065 --> 00:17:56,708
So we've worked on a lot of multiplayer experiences or networked experiences,

300
00:17:57,528 --> 00:18:00,390
and we always try to design a fallback for when the internet goes out.

301
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:04,012
Because every venue, every event we've done, at some point the internet goes out.

302
00:18:04,772 --> 00:18:09,075
And so we build our own LAN, we bring our own switches, our own Ethernet cables, our own power for all of that.

303
00:18:10,175 --> 00:18:14,538
So we have an elegant fallback so that when the internet goes out, we're not completely dead in the water.

304
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:19,332
And I will say that no venue is going to admit that this will happen to you.

305
00:18:20,452 --> 00:18:23,013
They will tell you that they have wonderful Wi-Fi,

306
00:18:23,053 --> 00:18:25,634
that they have hundreds of people using it during their events,

307
00:18:25,694 --> 00:18:27,775
and it's totally fine. It will support you.

308
00:18:28,235 --> 00:18:32,117
But they've never had very, very tech and Internet heavy,

309
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:36,338
thirsty setups before with their hundreds of people at the same time.

310
00:18:36,518 --> 00:18:40,280
And those competing needs will just, they'll create drops or lags.

311
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,541
And if your experience is dependent on a smooth Internet experience,

312
00:18:44,973 --> 00:18:46,094
Don't trust it, build your own.

313
00:18:47,034 --> 00:18:47,555
Exactly.

314
00:18:48,996 --> 00:18:51,438
You are also going to need a bunch of non-technical gear.

315
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,800
Congratulations on your new moving company,

316
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,982
because if you are moving events into and out of spaces, you have...

317
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:00,495
Basically the same needs as any moving service out there.

318
00:19:01,496 --> 00:19:05,660
From the very basic, like, clear plastic bins that you can easily label and look at

319
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:09,424
without opening and digging in them and be like, oh yeah, there are definitely four laptops in there.

320
00:19:09,864 --> 00:19:12,807
That's not a missing laptop box. We can load that already.

321
00:19:13,187 --> 00:19:17,551
To a ladder and fixtures that you can mount to the ceiling for your tracking solutions.

322
00:19:17,671 --> 00:19:21,375
Tripods so that you can not have access to the ceiling if that's unavailable.

323
00:19:21,835 --> 00:19:23,317
Dolly so that you're saving your back.

324
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:30,902
And of course, a van, because a four passenger car is not going to cut it for the amount of technology and gear that you will be bringing to and from these locations.

325
00:19:33,783 --> 00:19:35,064
Yeah, good, good thing I have a van.

326
00:19:36,205 --> 00:19:36,645
Convenient.

327
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:40,120
There's also some life-saving gear that's just,

328
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,960
it's not very special looking,

329
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,141
but it just, it comes in in the clinch

330
00:19:44,221 --> 00:19:44,721
and you're just like,

331
00:19:44,781 --> 00:19:48,142
I'm so glad we had 30 differently colored zip ties

332
00:19:48,162 --> 00:19:48,842
that one time.

333
00:19:49,002 --> 00:19:51,763
Or, hey, we had seven different colors of gaff tape.

334
00:19:51,963 --> 00:19:54,484
Wow, what a coincidence, we needed six, great.

335
00:19:55,084 --> 00:19:58,025
And gaff tape is just a huge thing to be aware of.

336
00:19:58,125 --> 00:19:59,425
If you're talking to different venues,

337
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:01,626
they'll be like, what are you using for a trip hazard?

338
00:20:01,686 --> 00:20:02,586
And if you say duct tape,

339
00:20:02,626 --> 00:20:03,506
they will sometimes tell you

340
00:20:03,526 --> 00:20:04,606
that you're not allowed to show there.

341
00:20:05,267 --> 00:20:16,253
Or they will hit you with a renovation fee afterwards because Duct Tape will strip up flooring treatments and also, like, sometimes it will just put dense little chips in sheetrock.

342
00:20:16,693 --> 00:20:18,414
So, Gaffing Tape's the way to go there.

343
00:20:18,494 --> 00:20:28,299
And then, Post-it Notes, if you've got an MR thing that needs a blank wall and maybe some tracking spots, there are a lot of little solutions that you can find for maybe $17 at a Walgreens.

344
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:29,380
Totally.

345
00:20:31,491 --> 00:20:35,794
And so we're very big on keeping our equipment clean, right?

346
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:41,297
You're talking about devices and hardware that sometimes get warm on people's faces, right?

347
00:20:41,337 --> 00:20:43,499
Like at least six people's faces an hour.

348
00:20:44,219 --> 00:20:48,502
And so we set up an assembly line of cleaning the equipment.

349
00:20:48,982 --> 00:20:53,145
So we always bring a couple of removable face masks for each VR headset.

350
00:20:53,766 --> 00:20:55,449
We wipe them down after every use.

351
00:20:55,489 --> 00:20:57,773
We wipe down the controllers and the earphones,

352
00:20:58,614 --> 00:21:00,097
and then give the masks time to dry.

353
00:21:00,117 --> 00:21:06,187
We use not the pleather ones, but the kind of fabric-y VR Cover Brand masks.

354
00:21:06,368 --> 00:21:06,969
They're very nice.

355
00:21:08,035 --> 00:21:12,037
And not hiding the cleaning process is something we're also pretty passionate about,

356
00:21:12,057 --> 00:21:14,358
because we want people to see that we're keeping things clean,

357
00:21:14,418 --> 00:21:19,942
and it gives them a reason to not say no to trying our VR demo or our show floor demo.

358
00:21:19,982 --> 00:21:22,803
We've actually had pretty high-end clients come by before and be like,

359
00:21:23,023 --> 00:21:25,405
oh, I see you're showing the thing. That's real nice.

360
00:21:25,705 --> 00:21:27,606
I don't want to try it though, because of conference cooties.

361
00:21:27,726 --> 00:21:30,848
And then they'll watch us go through a couple of sessions where there's a diligent

362
00:21:31,148 --> 00:21:34,350
assembly line that's just sanitation, putting these things clean

363
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,651
and ready for the next load of people to use.

364
00:21:36,691 --> 00:21:36,731
Oh.

365
00:21:37,712 --> 00:21:38,593
Oh, actually, I will get in.

366
00:21:38,733 --> 00:21:41,916
And then they try it at the event floor, and that's pretty major.

367
00:21:42,817 --> 00:21:46,080
And so we're actually really happy to see that XRDC is doing that.

368
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:49,324
And it's just very nice to see out in the wild, because for a while

369
00:21:49,364 --> 00:21:52,086
there in the very beginning of VR demos, people were just like, yeah, try it,

370
00:21:52,126 --> 00:21:53,268
try it, put it on your face, try it.

371
00:21:53,308 --> 00:21:54,989
And it's like, no.

372
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:57,012
So this is great.

373
00:21:59,465 --> 00:22:04,929
And finally, this brings us to emotional design, or the lasting emotional impact, the big feelings

374
00:22:04,989 --> 00:22:09,552
takeaway that people have from your experience, and the experiences tangential to trying your

375
00:22:09,672 --> 00:22:09,752
app.

376
00:22:12,575 --> 00:22:17,138
One way to make sure that people are going to have a better long-term capsule of this

377
00:22:17,218 --> 00:22:19,260
memory is to make the line a feature.

378
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:24,063
Lines can be pretty boring, it can feel like a chore to stand in one, like nothing interesting

379
00:22:24,103 --> 00:22:24,403
is happening.

380
00:22:24,423 --> 00:22:26,865
You've already made your decision that you're going to do this cool thing and now you've

381
00:22:26,885 --> 00:22:27,326
got to wait.

382
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:28,286
That sucks.

383
00:22:29,157 --> 00:22:32,159
But lines grab attention from the audience that's passing by.

384
00:22:32,479 --> 00:22:35,340
So how do you make the line something that's fun for the people already in it?

385
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,600
Use the time wisely.

386
00:22:37,521 --> 00:22:41,643
Here at RTX we had our screens turned so that all the people standing in line

387
00:22:42,063 --> 00:22:45,824
along the right side of the screen there could see the player perspectives

388
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:48,406
and learn their strategies and see what people were doing to

389
00:22:49,406 --> 00:22:52,829
Form alliances, do sneak attacks, all sorts of things like that.

390
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:56,172
It also, you can see at the very front, somebody is signing a waiver.

391
00:22:56,553 --> 00:23:00,256
We always provide waivers, particularly for our physical games, which lets people know

392
00:23:00,396 --> 00:23:01,737
you're about to do something very physical.

393
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:08,644
There's some inherent risk with that because we're blindfolding you from this reality with

394
00:23:08,704 --> 00:23:11,687
another reality, and we're encouraging you to flail around in space.

395
00:23:11,767 --> 00:23:13,448
So that lets them know what they're opting into.

396
00:23:14,382 --> 00:23:19,225
We also do a mailing list opt-in that lets us connect with folks who want us to

397
00:23:19,665 --> 00:23:23,047
and share updates and news as it comes out of that experience.

398
00:23:24,348 --> 00:23:27,250
Yeah, and you can see here there's a happy little accident at the end of the line.

399
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:29,952
We had four extra chairs, they just perfectly fit at the end of our booth

400
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:32,093
and we said, hey, okay, we're going to make this the on-deck area.

401
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:35,715
And so that let the players sort out, okay, who's going to be on the red team versus the blue team,

402
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:37,276
you know, which friends are playing together.

403
00:23:37,296 --> 00:23:41,779
Yeah, it was a really nice side effect and we've replicated that since.

404
00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:55,111
So one of the things we are just super, super adamant, verging on religious about is having one human person assisting each person taking a demo in VR.

405
00:23:55,411 --> 00:24:01,198
And so we named them Squires, right? Like a Squire helps a knight in and out of their armor and onto their trusty steed.

406
00:24:01,698 --> 00:24:05,843
So our VR Squires are people we work with, either developers or people in the community.

407
00:24:06,504 --> 00:24:09,148
We hire to work with us and we put them through a training course,

408
00:24:09,609 --> 00:24:12,634
not just about what the software does, but how the VR equipment works,

409
00:24:12,715 --> 00:24:16,241
how to adjust it for comfort, just so they can give a really good

410
00:24:16,301 --> 00:24:19,546
personalized demonstration to the people at all of our events.

411
00:24:21,133 --> 00:24:22,394
We find it very comforting.

412
00:24:23,015 --> 00:24:25,816
As Melissa said, VR can feel like you're getting a blindfold on.

413
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:28,518
And knowing that there's someone there who has your back,

414
00:24:28,918 --> 00:24:31,080
who's not going to let you bonk heads into someone else

415
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,841
or run into a wall at full speed, is very comforting.

416
00:24:34,322 --> 00:24:36,663
And so we've been doing this for a while now.

417
00:24:36,723 --> 00:24:38,924
We're huge fans of it. We can't recommend it enough.

418
00:24:39,745 --> 00:24:42,547
It does take a bit of coordination and extra effort to schedule all these people.

419
00:24:43,807 --> 00:24:45,768
But it's a big, big win.

420
00:24:45,989 --> 00:24:47,529
It's very worth it.

421
00:24:47,669 --> 00:24:48,090
Absolutely.

422
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:49,811
We've had player feedback.

423
00:24:49,831 --> 00:24:52,432
Sometimes we have an extra person take...

424
00:24:52,772 --> 00:24:54,213
Like if we have extra squires and it's like,

425
00:24:54,353 --> 00:24:58,035
oh, we're actually full, but we'd love it if you would talk to players as they exit the demo.

426
00:24:58,456 --> 00:25:01,617
Just find out what their favorite part was or if anything went wrong.

427
00:25:02,458 --> 00:25:05,400
Many of them are like, I'm so glad there was somebody there explaining stuff to me

428
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,481
and it felt good. It felt like I had a friend in there.

429
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,302
So the best way that you can make any of this happen is by taking care of your staff.

430
00:25:15,523 --> 00:25:19,727
The way that we do that is we recruit and pay RAD people to work our events with us.

431
00:25:20,367 --> 00:25:24,550
We want to make sure that we are respecting and valuing the time and effort and energy that they're putting into.

432
00:25:25,471 --> 00:25:30,834
We're showing our work to the world, and it just makes for a much better experience all around.

433
00:25:31,874 --> 00:25:33,875
When we schedule, we schedule overlap for breaks.

434
00:25:33,935 --> 00:25:38,677
That was a very hard one lesson, where the first time that we did one of these big demos,

435
00:25:38,717 --> 00:25:42,239
and we were like, oh, it's five of us, and we know the thing inside and out,

436
00:25:42,259 --> 00:25:45,580
and that'll be fun and easy, and six hours later,

437
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:50,022
the dregs of our souls were just scraped into a corner in the room,

438
00:25:50,062 --> 00:25:53,724
because it was so exhausting, and we're like, cool, next time.

439
00:25:53,744 --> 00:25:54,565
And then we had Taco Bell.

440
00:25:55,558 --> 00:25:56,460
And then we had Taco Bell.

441
00:25:57,221 --> 00:25:59,123
Next time what we have to do is make sure

442
00:25:59,284 --> 00:26:00,846
that there is productive redundancy,

443
00:26:00,986 --> 00:26:03,209
enough people in place so that people can take breaks.

444
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,093
If somebody has an emergency come up that they can leave

445
00:26:06,153 --> 00:26:09,718
and it won't just, it won't hinder the entire demo.

446
00:26:10,539 --> 00:26:12,560
Another thing that you want to do is rotate the roles.

447
00:26:12,701 --> 00:26:16,604
If you have many different staffing areas like squire, line management,

448
00:26:16,984 --> 00:26:18,926
someone to drive the spectator PC view,

449
00:26:19,346 --> 00:26:23,970
you want to rotate people in so that they're not completely burned out on one role.

450
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:28,994
Because it's a lot of energy and effort of people communication to do line management,

451
00:26:29,374 --> 00:26:31,216
it's a little bit less intense to do squire.

452
00:26:31,576 --> 00:26:36,760
It's even less intense to do the spectator PC, but there are more different types of decisions to make in that position.

453
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:40,103
So you want to rotate people into roles that they click with and also give them breaks.

454
00:26:40,783 --> 00:26:44,586
Lots of water bottles as well is very important and also standing comfort aids.

455
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,348
So like insoles, pads.

456
00:26:46,768 --> 00:26:50,711
We've all been in a conference for several hours and felt what it feels like to have your...

457
00:26:50,931 --> 00:26:54,574
Basically your heels are liquefying the whole time and it just becomes pain at the end of the day.

458
00:26:54,914 --> 00:26:56,215
You want to protect your staff from this.

459
00:26:56,796 --> 00:26:58,397
And then you also want to keep them informed.

460
00:26:58,797 --> 00:27:01,799
We do that with a document that we call the run of show document,

461
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,981
which has all of the information. It's hefty.

462
00:27:04,001 --> 00:27:06,243
There's an online version and then there's a couple of physical versions

463
00:27:06,403 --> 00:27:08,044
at the place in case the internet goes down.

464
00:27:08,704 --> 00:27:10,586
And this is a theme. That's right.

465
00:27:11,707 --> 00:27:15,650
And it has all the information and emergency contact numbers and protocols

466
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:17,811
and even some light troubleshooting for the squires

467
00:27:17,931 --> 00:27:19,993
if somebody has to leave and step away for a second.

468
00:27:20,653 --> 00:27:22,555
Yeah. Super, super valuable.

469
00:27:24,816 --> 00:27:31,403
And then, you know, something that we've been working on more the last couple years is what do we do after the demonstration, right?

470
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:35,547
If you're very focused on turnaround time and trying to get as many people through the experience as possible,

471
00:27:35,947 --> 00:27:39,831
it's easy to be like, hey, thanks a whole lot, you know, take the VR gear off, get out of here.

472
00:27:40,731 --> 00:27:43,874
So lately what we've been doing is almost like a receiving station when someone leaves.

473
00:27:43,934 --> 00:27:46,857
So sometimes there's swag, it could be stickers, posters, or T-shirts.

474
00:27:47,878 --> 00:27:55,541
A couple setups we've done have had automated photos and videos where you can give people a digital memento of their experience.

475
00:27:56,701 --> 00:28:02,223
And also we learned to tell people what the hashtag is because often, again, this is going to go live on the internet forever.

476
00:28:02,603 --> 00:28:05,484
And we want to be able to find the content that people are posting about the experience.

477
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:09,286
So telling them, hey, this is the official hashtag of this event or this game has really helped.

478
00:28:10,602 --> 00:28:17,052
Something else that we've seen is that high score boards have this really interesting sort of viral element to them,

479
00:28:17,092 --> 00:28:22,240
just like a classic arcade game, where some players are going to play the game or play the experience and enjoy it and be like,

480
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:25,284
okay, that was cool. And then other people are going to leave and say, well, how did I do?

481
00:28:26,005 --> 00:28:29,669
And so for those players to have a high scoreboard that's posted on a side screen

482
00:28:31,171 --> 00:28:33,474
can really be a win, because they might want to come back and just,

483
00:28:33,514 --> 00:28:35,436
well, can I do better? Can I get a better score?

484
00:28:35,976 --> 00:28:38,719
Or, you know, also very likely they're going to go recruit their friends and say,

485
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:41,302
hey, here's my score. You should come back and try to beat this one.

486
00:28:41,322 --> 00:28:45,187
So so we're pulling in these old ideas of classic arcade games,

487
00:28:45,747 --> 00:28:46,588
making them new again with VR.

488
00:28:48,355 --> 00:28:50,756
And then of course, you want to have your mailing list again.

489
00:28:50,876 --> 00:28:53,197
If somebody didn't opt in before they knew what the experience was,

490
00:28:53,297 --> 00:28:54,558
maybe now that they've played it, they're like,

491
00:28:54,618 --> 00:28:56,559
no, I definitely want to know when this hits the market.

492
00:28:56,579 --> 00:28:58,620
I've got four buddies I want to play with. I'm ready.

493
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,861
And so you want to have that available for them.

494
00:29:01,021 --> 00:29:04,062
And you want to make that very low friction to just be like, OK, yes.

495
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:05,403
Email me all of the things.

496
00:29:05,883 --> 00:29:07,664
Make this easy for me to wishlist it.

497
00:29:08,025 --> 00:29:09,325
And then follow up interviews again.

498
00:29:09,546 --> 00:29:12,128
You want to have somebody that's there to answer questions like,

499
00:29:12,348 --> 00:29:13,629
Hey, when can I play this again?

500
00:29:13,689 --> 00:29:14,649
Where are you showing next?

501
00:29:14,729 --> 00:29:18,352
And sometimes we have that answer and that information for some of our installs.

502
00:29:18,392 --> 00:29:20,374
And we're like, yes, you can see us here.

503
00:29:20,674 --> 00:29:24,877
And sometimes it's just like, no, the best way to do this is to follow us on social media to connect with us.

504
00:29:25,057 --> 00:29:26,898
And you just want to build that web of interconnectivity.

505
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,481
Last but not least, safety.

506
00:29:31,907 --> 00:29:35,268
When you're doing any event, you're creating a micro-community.

507
00:29:35,749 --> 00:29:39,851
And frequently when you create a micro-community, you've created the potential for a longer-lasting,

508
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:40,911
evergreen community.

509
00:29:41,512 --> 00:29:45,354
Any community, any group of people brought together by common likes, passions, goals,

510
00:29:45,394 --> 00:29:51,057
and drives needs a rule of interaction and a base of responsibility and behavior that's

511
00:29:51,097 --> 00:29:51,577
acceptable.

512
00:29:52,037 --> 00:29:56,620
Codes of conduct are the way to pave that way forward and make sure that the community

513
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,501
that you are growing, the event that you are nurturing,

514
00:29:58,981 --> 00:30:03,684
It is supported and kept safe and that it's clear to everybody what's acceptable and not.

515
00:30:04,845 --> 00:30:07,347
So having one of those from the get-go is really important.

516
00:30:07,527 --> 00:30:11,770
If the event that you're showing at or the showcase that you're part of doesn't have one,

517
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:16,153
you can still put one together for your team and have everybody basically opt into,

518
00:30:16,313 --> 00:30:19,235
yes, I understand what's expected of me and how to behave.

519
00:30:19,956 --> 00:30:21,476
And I've agreed to it and I've signed it.

520
00:30:21,757 --> 00:30:24,818
So we frequently do that with our events and our showcases as well.

521
00:30:25,479 --> 00:30:28,981
Another important thing to include is the emergency contacts for your staff.

522
00:30:29,361 --> 00:30:31,962
If somebody has an accident or if you need to get a hold of somebody,

523
00:30:32,002 --> 00:30:33,863
that's an important piece of information to have.

524
00:30:34,323 --> 00:30:36,585
You also want to have first aid kits because it's boo-boos.

525
00:30:36,665 --> 00:30:37,425
They do happen.

526
00:30:37,825 --> 00:30:40,367
You're up a ladder, you scrape an elbow, you get a paper cut.

527
00:30:40,727 --> 00:30:44,249
You want to be able to band-aid that and not have that be something that puts a crimp in your style.

528
00:30:44,728 --> 00:30:50,272
And then finally, you want to make sure your staff knows how to react in a particular situation and how to report incidents.

529
00:30:50,772 --> 00:30:55,575
We frequently have sort of like just very beginning orientation setups for our new staff members.

530
00:30:56,036 --> 00:30:58,517
And we'll also do a PSA of like, hey, we want to hear what's up.

531
00:30:58,677 --> 00:31:00,819
We want to hear if there's anything that you have questions about.

532
00:31:00,899 --> 00:31:04,321
If somebody is doing something and it's causing doubt for you, we'd rather hear about it than not.

533
00:31:04,701 --> 00:31:10,145
And then we can help coach that situation, the response, and also just make sure that we're keeping everybody safe and supported.

534
00:31:10,894 --> 00:31:14,476
Absolutely. Just how we said that oftentimes people doing a VR demo don't want to complain.

535
00:31:14,896 --> 00:31:18,058
We've also found that new Squires who are working with us for the first time,

536
00:31:18,438 --> 00:31:21,139
they don't know if they're supposed to complain. You know, we really have to tell them, hey,

537
00:31:21,199 --> 00:31:25,301
this is the type of behavior that's out of bounds. We need to know about it and really model that

538
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:30,084
for them up front. So that orientation really pays big dividends and it helps foster a healthier

539
00:31:30,124 --> 00:31:30,904
community. Yes.

540
00:31:33,966 --> 00:31:36,287
All right. We've got some key takeaways from you to.

541
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:38,991
Do you want to take this one?

542
00:31:39,011 --> 00:31:42,691
Sure. Yeah. I mean, my big takeaway is I'm a lifelong software developer.

543
00:31:43,351 --> 00:31:46,132
And since I've been working in VR five, six years now,

544
00:31:46,772 --> 00:31:49,593
I've just done an increasing amount of event work and community work.

545
00:31:49,633 --> 00:31:52,593
So if you're in virtual reality and you're making or selling VR,

546
00:31:53,154 --> 00:31:54,434
get ready to show it off a whole lot.

547
00:31:54,874 --> 00:31:56,574
Think about and take events very seriously.

548
00:31:57,755 --> 00:32:01,595
Also, a big shift, a mental shift is you're no longer designing

549
00:32:01,655 --> 00:32:04,036
for this one theoretical player who's going to play the game.

550
00:32:04,892 --> 00:32:06,313
by themselves, at home, alone.

551
00:32:06,614 --> 00:32:09,096
You're designing for this entire demonstration experience.

552
00:32:09,436 --> 00:32:13,200
And I think that these lessons are very applicable to other elements in the game industry going on,

553
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:16,103
like Twitch streaming, Let's Play videos.

554
00:32:16,503 --> 00:32:19,126
You know, video games are a spectator sport.

555
00:32:19,186 --> 00:32:21,388
VR and AR are absolutely a spectator sport as well.

556
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,041
And when you're at an event, be flexible.

557
00:32:25,761 --> 00:32:26,561
Shit goes wrong.

558
00:32:26,881 --> 00:32:27,502
Shit breaks.

559
00:32:27,882 --> 00:32:28,302
Roll with it.

560
00:32:28,362 --> 00:32:29,583
It hits the fan.

561
00:32:29,663 --> 00:32:30,323
It does occasionally.

562
00:32:30,343 --> 00:32:31,003
Also hit the fan.

563
00:32:31,483 --> 00:32:33,004
So yeah, just roll with it.

564
00:32:33,564 --> 00:32:34,605
Know that that will happen.

565
00:32:34,805 --> 00:32:40,547
Try to arrive early and, you know, have a backup plan.

566
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:46,501
Speaking of backup plan, always bring your own gear and bring extras. Again, never trust the

567
00:32:46,541 --> 00:32:49,642
internet. You want to make sure that you are bringing all of the things that will allow you

568
00:32:49,662 --> 00:32:53,544
to be as self-reliant as possible, and then bring extra. Because if something does go wrong,

569
00:32:53,624 --> 00:32:57,386
or something extra goes wrong, you want to have some contingency set aside for that.

570
00:32:57,946 --> 00:33:02,589
And if the heavens align, and the sun like cones through the clouds, and it's just a beautiful

571
00:33:02,629 --> 00:33:07,671
choir chorus that hits this perfect note, and nothing goes wrong with your demo on this day,

572
00:33:08,372 --> 00:33:11,493
Your neighbor will have technical issues and one of their adapters won't work

573
00:33:11,553 --> 00:33:13,834
and their headset will have cracked because a player dropped it.

574
00:33:14,214 --> 00:33:15,195
And you'll be able to be like,

575
00:33:15,235 --> 00:33:17,075
Dear friend, I will assist you.

576
00:33:17,976 --> 00:33:21,637
But this community and this creatorship is still new enough

577
00:33:21,717 --> 00:33:25,039
that every first experience that somebody has sort of colors

578
00:33:25,459 --> 00:33:28,680
the entire playing field, even if the experiences are very different.

579
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,522
So if I have a bad first experience in somebody else's VR setup

580
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:33,863
because the base station was wobbly or not tracking properly,

581
00:33:34,223 --> 00:33:36,624
I'm not necessarily going to get into the next person's VR.

582
00:33:36,724 --> 00:33:37,004
And now.

583
00:33:37,484 --> 00:33:42,768
You've lost that potential customer who would have been wowed and talked to their 30,000 online followers.

584
00:33:42,948 --> 00:33:46,691
So you want to make sure that you're making it as easy as possible for people to have a good time,

585
00:33:47,072 --> 00:33:50,674
not just in your experiences, but in everybody's experiences, because this is a team effort.

586
00:33:51,735 --> 00:33:54,998
Part of that is also cleaning your gear often and in front of the audience, like we said before,

587
00:33:55,398 --> 00:33:59,561
you want to remove barriers to saying yes. And part of that is when you're in a group of people,

588
00:33:59,601 --> 00:34:03,864
you're like, but who here is patient zero? And you want to make sure that you are not

589
00:34:03,924 --> 00:34:05,606
contributing to the zombie apocalypse.

590
00:34:06,046 --> 00:34:06,526
It's important.

591
00:34:06,766 --> 00:34:08,046
And then finally, code of conduct.

592
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:10,107
Even in a zombie apocalypse, we will need one.

593
00:34:10,307 --> 00:34:11,067
You will need one.

594
00:34:11,567 --> 00:34:16,068
Any VR meetup, any XR party, any AR showcase, any MR event.

595
00:34:17,168 --> 00:34:19,248
Get on it and make sure that you are clearly

596
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:21,569
stating what's acceptable, what the outcomes

597
00:34:21,609 --> 00:34:23,749
of different behaviors are, and how to keep people

598
00:34:23,789 --> 00:34:24,469
safe and supported.

599
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:26,050
Well put.

600
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:30,291
Well, thank you very much for coming to our session.

601
00:34:30,351 --> 00:34:30,731
We did it.

602
00:34:30,791 --> 00:34:32,031
We made it through the last session of the day.

603
00:34:38,512 --> 00:34:40,332
I think we have a little time for questions.

604
00:34:40,753 --> 00:34:43,294
Yeah. There's a microphone there for questions.

605
00:34:43,834 --> 00:34:46,335
In the meantime, you can find us online at farbridge.com

606
00:34:46,756 --> 00:34:49,257
or vraustin.org, also on the Twitters.

607
00:34:49,737 --> 00:34:53,339
Our next VR Jam is in one month, and looking at the date

608
00:34:53,419 --> 00:34:55,020
and realizing it's exactly a month away

609
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,581
is giving me some palpitations, but also excitement.

610
00:34:58,481 --> 00:35:01,943
So come jam with us in VR Austin's Jam in Austin, Texas.

611
00:35:03,404 --> 00:35:03,724
Thanks, y'all.

612
00:35:09,416 --> 00:35:11,777
Oh, hello. Yes. Hi. Step right up.

613
00:35:12,057 --> 00:35:16,699
Yeah. So I do agree with the whole thing of carrying everything together with you.

614
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:22,261
Right. I mean, I think every time I have missed out on a power strip, it's just totally sucked.

615
00:35:22,281 --> 00:35:26,103
So now what I have is like a standard kit from Pelican.

616
00:35:26,563 --> 00:35:28,584
You know, those guys make this very nice rugged boxes.

617
00:35:28,644 --> 00:35:31,945
It has wheels, space for everything.

618
00:35:32,025 --> 00:35:35,346
Right. And totally, totally something I would recommend to anybody else.

619
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:41,465
Do you have, so I see that you guys doing a lot of trade shows and events.

620
00:35:43,527 --> 00:35:48,373
Any best practices or experiences when you are like the one person flying down and to

621
00:35:48,393 --> 00:35:50,555
give a demo to somebody, right?

622
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:54,572
Go and it solo. Yeah, that is rough.

623
00:35:54,873 --> 00:35:57,335
If you don't have any backup that's going to meet you there,

624
00:35:57,375 --> 00:35:58,776
you don't have a friend to go with you.

625
00:35:58,796 --> 00:36:02,399
Customer site. Yeah, I think it's really important

626
00:36:02,439 --> 00:36:05,401
then to talk to the vendor or the venue that you're going to be at

627
00:36:05,501 --> 00:36:07,763
and figure out if they have a volunteer to spare

628
00:36:07,803 --> 00:36:09,844
that will be able to step in when you need a bathroom break

629
00:36:10,465 --> 00:36:12,887
or if you can shut down for a portion of the day.

630
00:36:13,307 --> 00:36:15,629
Frequently when we have group events,

631
00:36:15,689 --> 00:36:18,031
one of the things that we need to do is tell like,

632
00:36:18,151 --> 00:36:20,693
hey, during lunchtime, we're not going to have.

633
00:36:21,834 --> 00:36:25,574
Any sessions for an hour because things get hot and we need them to cool down.

634
00:36:26,555 --> 00:36:28,815
Maybe a computer tries to update during a play session.

635
00:36:28,835 --> 00:36:30,136
It's like, no, we'll let that happen.

636
00:36:30,636 --> 00:36:35,097
You want to make sure that you have breaks built in, particularly if you're going it solo.

637
00:36:35,917 --> 00:36:39,938
Treat yourself the way you would want to treat other people as like a resource.

638
00:36:40,038 --> 00:36:41,458
And you don't want to burn yourself out.

639
00:36:41,958 --> 00:36:45,199
So talk to the vendor, talk to the person who is on the other end and be like,

640
00:36:45,399 --> 00:36:48,600
Hey, to do the best job of showcasing this app by myself.

641
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:50,681
These are the things that I can do.

642
00:36:50,801 --> 00:36:53,942
So I'll do sessions or you need to assign me a buddy.

643
00:36:54,602 --> 00:36:55,402
Okay. Cool.

644
00:36:56,822 --> 00:36:57,783
If you have anything to add, Patrick?

645
00:36:57,803 --> 00:37:01,704
I was also just going to add being able to request a specific type of room,

646
00:37:02,004 --> 00:37:04,785
if you're going to a large company to give them demonstrations of a piece of software,

647
00:37:05,305 --> 00:37:09,206
ask them, hey, do you have a spare conference room with blinds that close and a high ceiling?

648
00:37:09,646 --> 00:37:09,866
Yeah.

649
00:37:10,206 --> 00:37:14,808
Something as simple as that could go a long way towards a much smoother demonstration.

650
00:37:15,848 --> 00:37:22,072
One comment regarding the whole third person view though is I realized that a lot of people were kind of nervous

651
00:37:22,973 --> 00:37:26,755
Trying out the VR the first time and and I think just having

652
00:37:27,856 --> 00:37:31,958
Like a screen view of what they were seeing was actually very helpful for me to be able to see that

653
00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:37,542
Oh, this guy's totally lost. Let me help him out with yeah, absolutely because you know user interfaces are not perfect. So

654
00:37:38,806 --> 00:37:43,050
Yeah, so I still prefer to demonstrate on a laptop with a tethered headset.

655
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:47,534
So on the laptop I can see what they see, and the laptop view doesn't have to be what

656
00:37:47,554 --> 00:37:48,695
the entire crowd is seeing.

657
00:37:49,115 --> 00:37:50,857
That's there for us as a debugging tool.

658
00:37:52,158 --> 00:37:56,782
But then investing in a spectator camera for everyone else to view, that's paid off dividends.

659
00:37:56,802 --> 00:37:58,063
So yeah, I agree, I want both.

660
00:37:58,583 --> 00:38:00,605
And for standalone headsets, it's...

661
00:38:01,386 --> 00:38:07,352
It's a semi unsolved problem in terms of how do we make that really foolproof where I know what you're seeing and can actually help you.

662
00:38:08,954 --> 00:38:17,583
One other thing I have noticed, and I don't know if you have the same experience, but certain people who are nervous in getting into VR, there's a good chance that they'll come out with a bad experience.

663
00:38:19,605 --> 00:38:23,727
I'm just always thinking that I should just not even encourage them to do that because they kind of

664
00:38:24,348 --> 00:38:28,370
go back with this negative thing and then everybody else kind of feels like, oh,

665
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:32,732
you know, it might not work for like, you know, more people. So it kind of destroys the,

666
00:38:33,092 --> 00:38:35,613
you know, I don't know, just something that I don't know if you have experience with that.

667
00:38:35,693 --> 00:38:37,634
An approach I've used with people who are

668
00:38:38,435 --> 00:38:40,797
You can see that they want to get in, but they're very nervous.

669
00:38:40,897 --> 00:38:44,320
Maybe they've tried VR before and it made them nauseous, or it made them scared,

670
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:46,441
or somebody jump-scared them for their first VR experience.

671
00:38:46,461 --> 00:38:47,542
They're like, ha ha, gotcha.

672
00:38:47,562 --> 00:38:52,326
And it's like, cool, you've given this person this anxiety about trying this new creative medium again.

673
00:38:53,167 --> 00:38:58,151
What I do with folks like that, I'm like, hey, I totally get that maybe you don't want to jump into a multiplayer experience right now.

674
00:38:58,832 --> 00:39:05,580
Come back in like half an hour when we're about to shut down and I'll put you in the lobby, the like waiting area, and you can just see what it feels like to move around.

675
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:12,948
No other players will be there, like I'll try to find little pockets of like opportunity for this one person to have a redo of their first experience.

676
00:39:12,969 --> 00:39:17,854
And I'll be like, I'm not even going to clip your headphones on the hallway. I'll leave one open and I'll be the voice in your ear. I'll be your Navi.

677
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:19,276
And I'll just be there and be like,

678
00:39:19,496 --> 00:39:20,457
hey, you want to go to the right?

679
00:39:20,497 --> 00:39:21,198
OK, look over there.

680
00:39:21,238 --> 00:39:22,980
Like, yeah, that's a tool that you can do.

681
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,304
You want to click this button and basically give them this very bespoke

682
00:39:26,524 --> 00:39:28,586
first walkthrough, because I think it's important.

683
00:39:28,706 --> 00:39:31,209
And anytime I see somebody not having fun with something that I know

684
00:39:31,269 --> 00:39:35,113
is so capable of being enjoyed, like just so full of enjoyment,

685
00:39:35,133 --> 00:39:36,695
I'm like, I want to fix this for you.

686
00:39:36,755 --> 00:39:39,318
I want to give you a good shot at finding your feet in VR.

687
00:39:40,279 --> 00:39:44,665
So, I think it's really just about taking that personal, person-to-person moment, if you can.

688
00:39:45,045 --> 00:39:48,971
It's not always available because of the rush of VR conferences, but it's worth finding when you can.

689
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:54,312
Do you think that there are people who are actually nervous because they feel like they're

690
00:39:54,332 --> 00:39:56,934
going to look bad in front of the people?

691
00:39:57,014 --> 00:40:00,615
I mean, how many of us would want to be blindfolded right now in front of everyone else here?

692
00:40:01,656 --> 00:40:06,278
That's not a natural, oh yeah, let's definitely do that, sensation for a lot of people.

693
00:40:07,259 --> 00:40:10,200
Also, I think there's just a lot of reasons that someone might not want to do VR.

694
00:40:11,521 --> 00:40:17,487
In a public space they might wear glasses and not be comfortable taking them off or they might not like the way they look without

695
00:40:17,507 --> 00:40:21,590
The glasses on or they might have a very expensive hairdo, right? They don't want to mess up and like

696
00:40:22,591 --> 00:40:29,658
Those there's just lots of factors there. So yeah, we were big on consent and we're almost never gonna talk someone or pressure someone into Trump

697
00:40:30,069 --> 00:40:32,892
Have you actually tried to carry like hairbrushes for people?

698
00:40:32,952 --> 00:40:34,634
Because I'm always thinking about that.

699
00:40:34,694 --> 00:40:37,658
And I don't know if it's stupid to ask this question.

700
00:40:37,818 --> 00:40:39,400
No, but I think that that's an interesting idea.

701
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,843
I mean, I think people just always like I do that,

702
00:40:41,903 --> 00:40:44,827
like in my office, because I'm sometimes in a suit, right?

703
00:40:44,987 --> 00:40:47,490
And my engineers give me a headset to try on.

704
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:48,031
I'm doing that.

705
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:48,852
And after that, I'm like.

706
00:40:49,863 --> 00:40:50,443
You know, how do I look?

707
00:40:50,723 --> 00:40:52,284
We do the opposite.

708
00:40:52,304 --> 00:40:56,186
We have skull caps at the office, like weird balaclavas.

709
00:40:56,266 --> 00:40:57,426
Oh no, they're so stylish.

710
00:40:57,507 --> 00:41:00,328
Everyone run out and buy one right now so you feel less weird.

711
00:41:00,348 --> 00:41:02,109
They're not attractive looking at all.

712
00:41:02,629 --> 00:41:05,790
But when you're passing headsets around, like an office of a bunch of people and,

713
00:41:06,791 --> 00:41:08,292
you know, cooties can get around.

714
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:11,793
So, yeah, there's a lot of reasons people might not want to try.

715
00:41:12,133 --> 00:41:16,095
I could see a future where it's like, oh cool, I just went through this big VR experience,

716
00:41:16,195 --> 00:41:18,536
it's like this ride and it's amazing and my hair is just...

717
00:41:19,096 --> 00:41:19,216
Yeah.

718
00:41:19,236 --> 00:41:22,917
And then like at the end of it, it's like here's a disposable comb and a little face wipe and

719
00:41:22,957 --> 00:41:26,299
everything like in a little baggie to like let you feel like a human again.

720
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:27,719
You could totally see that.

721
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:31,500
I don't think we're quite there yet, but I would actually kind of love to spec out

722
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,882
what that kit would need and how much it would cost at scale because that's my brain.

723
00:41:36,262 --> 00:41:37,162
I like your idea of...

724
00:41:39,172 --> 00:41:40,552
You know, giving some kind of a...

725
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:42,133
What was the word you used?

726
00:41:42,153 --> 00:41:42,773
Like a takeaway.

727
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:43,754
Like a takeaway, right?

728
00:41:43,794 --> 00:41:46,455
And I think especially a picture of somebody interacting with that whole thing.

729
00:41:46,475 --> 00:41:48,376
Maybe like a video clip would be a nice thing to do.

730
00:41:48,696 --> 00:41:54,399
We frequently have players ask the Squires if they would mind filming them on their photos.

731
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:58,501
And I like that because then that person is in control and they have total consent and

732
00:41:58,541 --> 00:42:01,842
like power over what happens to those images and those videos.

733
00:42:02,522 --> 00:42:05,724
And then they have a little memento and they can put it on their social media.

734
00:42:06,405 --> 00:42:11,240
We've also like will go up to people and be like, hey, we caught a really cool clip of you doing this thing.

735
00:42:12,256 --> 00:42:14,277
Here it is. Are you cool with us posting this?

736
00:42:14,317 --> 00:42:17,079
Because again, we want everybody to feel as safe as possible

737
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:19,380
in this very new, very weird space,

738
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,202
particularly if you're not technologically inclined at all.

739
00:42:22,342 --> 00:42:23,022
Yeah.

740
00:42:23,803 --> 00:42:25,624
I mean, I think it gives the sales guys

741
00:42:25,684 --> 00:42:27,285
like a good reason to follow up, right?

742
00:42:27,705 --> 00:42:28,826
Hey, I have to send you your picture.

743
00:42:28,926 --> 00:42:30,006
Why don't you give me your email address,

744
00:42:30,026 --> 00:42:31,147
and I'll put you on the meeting list.

745
00:42:31,787 --> 00:42:33,488
Yeah. Just say it quickly. Give me those digits.

746
00:42:34,369 --> 00:42:34,729
Thank you.

747
00:42:35,109 --> 00:42:36,390
Thank you so much. Great talk.

748
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:37,170
Thank you.

749
00:42:38,711 --> 00:42:40,012
As far as the spectator cam?

750
00:42:40,845 --> 00:42:48,729
Is that like, are you using like a, a, another object in the game space or is it as low tech

751
00:42:48,789 --> 00:42:53,050
as just like five players in a four player game and they're just walking around with

752
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,071
the keyboard?

753
00:42:54,111 --> 00:42:54,951
It's pretty low tech.

754
00:42:55,011 --> 00:42:57,232
It's a fifth player, but they're not in VR.

755
00:42:57,292 --> 00:42:58,273
So it's a non VR.

756
00:42:58,293 --> 00:42:59,433
So yeah, they're just on the screen.

757
00:42:59,453 --> 00:43:01,054
They're on WASDing, flying around.

758
00:43:01,074 --> 00:43:01,834
Flying around the camera.

759
00:43:02,274 --> 00:43:06,016
In some of the game modes, we've just made the camera visible and that way like people

760
00:43:06,036 --> 00:43:06,436
can see it.

761
00:43:06,496 --> 00:43:07,256
Like climbing.

762
00:43:07,677 --> 00:43:14,099
Yeah, we shot a trailer for Jar Wars and they quickly modded out this really clunky retro

763
00:43:14,119 --> 00:43:18,661
camera and we were all goofing for it. So that's the future too then, because if you've got this

764
00:43:19,181 --> 00:43:22,682
thing floating around and you see your players are like, oh hey, now we've got to do the really

765
00:43:22,722 --> 00:43:27,124
cool thing because the camera can see us, woohoo! Fortnite dances. Exactly.

766
00:43:28,765 --> 00:43:34,287
In the trailer, I do the flossing dance, but in VR with no legs, so it looks very strange.

767
00:43:34,307 --> 00:43:35,148
It's just wiggling.

768
00:43:35,188 --> 00:43:36,888
Yeah, no, it's just like, like that.

769
00:43:37,408 --> 00:43:40,770
But like all of these things, it was like, oh, we have to do this thing.

770
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:43,211
On the other side, it was like, oh, this is a feature.

771
00:43:43,291 --> 00:43:45,452
There's a really fun interaction available there.

772
00:43:45,472 --> 00:43:47,333
Like, oh, now we can make cool little movie clips.

773
00:43:47,473 --> 00:43:49,934
Like, yeah, always a way to turn it around.

774
00:43:49,954 --> 00:43:51,014
Thanks.

775
00:43:51,054 --> 00:43:51,855
Thank you.

776
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:52,275
Sure thing.

777
00:43:53,695 --> 00:43:54,176
Is that it?

778
00:43:55,696 --> 00:43:55,996
All right.

779
00:43:56,016 --> 00:43:56,597
Thanks, y'all.

780
00:43:57,457 --> 00:43:58,017
Safe travels home.
