1
00:00:06,973 --> 00:00:07,634
Oh, hello.

2
00:00:07,634 --> 00:00:09,735
Oh, first thing, if somebody else is coming,

3
00:00:09,735 --> 00:00:10,975
please sit in the middle, because I

4
00:00:10,975 --> 00:00:12,275
think it's going to be pretty full.

5
00:00:12,275 --> 00:00:17,938
So yeah, I'm going to be talking about my work at Supergiant

6
00:00:17,938 --> 00:00:18,238
Games.

7
00:00:18,238 --> 00:00:20,259
This is my first job in the industry, basically.

8
00:00:20,259 --> 00:00:23,860
I've been there for five and a half years.

9
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,681
So basically, what I'm going to be showing

10
00:00:25,681 --> 00:00:29,682
is some of the key elements during these five years,

11
00:00:29,682 --> 00:00:31,923
what I consider is something important,

12
00:00:31,923 --> 00:00:34,584
what I do every day at work.

13
00:00:34,584 --> 00:00:36,045
A little bit about me.

14
00:00:38,108 --> 00:00:40,849
I'm from Colombia.

15
00:00:40,849 --> 00:00:44,751
I studied visual arts in Colombia, and I also did a master's in animation here in San Francisco.

16
00:00:44,751 --> 00:00:53,416
I previously worked in video editing, motion graphics, 3D illustration, 3D animation.

17
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:58,038
As many of you, I think bringing characters to life is my passion, and then sort of exploring

18
00:00:58,038 --> 00:01:03,301
their personality and how they deal with internal and external conflicts through design and

19
00:01:03,301 --> 00:01:04,262
animation.

20
00:01:04,262 --> 00:01:07,443
I think this part, like the animation, sorry, the design.

21
00:01:08,449 --> 00:01:18,612
part of the process because I think it's like something that a lot of, especially a lot of animators, they tend to forget about those things very often.

22
00:01:18,612 --> 00:01:29,334
Yeah, I joined Supergiant Games in 2012. That was my first, I was the first and only in-house 3D artist in the company.

23
00:01:29,334 --> 00:01:37,417
I didn't have any previous experience in games, so basically I had to figure out like my workflow for every project and then figure out my schedule.

24
00:01:38,804 --> 00:01:45,108
um, create my own rules for like the 3D production and also dealing with my self-doubt since I was

25
00:01:45,108 --> 00:01:49,170
very new to the industry, I didn't know much and everybody in the company they have like

26
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:55,514
five to ten years experience and they were like already rock stars so I was like pretty intimidating

27
00:01:55,514 --> 00:02:03,898
at the beginning. So basically I'm in charge of all the 3D path line from modeling to rendering.

28
00:02:04,845 --> 00:02:09,166
At the beginning I worked with Greg Kassarin, he's the creative director, and Jen Seed, our director.

29
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:13,967
I tried to figure out with them the design of the character design and tried to figure out

30
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:18,868
what kind of elements we want to keep that are important for the story, but also what kind of

31
00:02:18,868 --> 00:02:25,509
things we have to get rid of, because I don't want to deal with that many tiny details in the

32
00:02:25,509 --> 00:02:30,250
character, so I kind of have to find a balance between what we can do in production and the

33
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,250
things that we can keep.

34
00:02:33,993 --> 00:02:35,314
connected to the story, basically.

35
00:02:35,314 --> 00:02:37,776
I do also some of the rigging.

36
00:02:37,776 --> 00:02:39,697
Some of the rigging is done from scratch.

37
00:02:39,697 --> 00:02:41,639
Some other ones, I use other rig tools.

38
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:44,361
It depends on what kind of character I'm gonna be doing.

39
00:02:44,361 --> 00:02:47,183
The animation part, I work with Amir Rauf.

40
00:02:47,183 --> 00:02:50,966
He's one of the designers and also the studio director.

41
00:02:50,966 --> 00:02:53,468
This is a key part also for me

42
00:02:53,468 --> 00:02:56,330
because since I didn't know anything about video games,

43
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:59,873
I learned a lot from Amir about game mechanics.

44
00:03:00,867 --> 00:03:03,808
how to implement them and how to combine,

45
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,888
how actually every animation is gonna,

46
00:03:05,888 --> 00:03:08,209
how they work together, like for example,

47
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:11,029
how all the attacks, they work together,

48
00:03:11,029 --> 00:03:12,770
things like that.

49
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:13,590
So, and rendering.

50
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:16,751
Well, okay, first thing, modeling.

51
00:03:16,751 --> 00:03:18,991
So, three things that I wanna emphasize in this talk

52
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:23,692
is like, first of all, character design mindset

53
00:03:23,692 --> 00:03:24,672
to entire pipeline.

54
00:03:24,672 --> 00:03:27,253
This is something that I'm always very,

55
00:03:28,685 --> 00:03:31,627
aware of in the process, because actually when people,

56
00:03:31,627 --> 00:03:33,368
sometimes when people ask me questions

57
00:03:33,368 --> 00:03:35,610
about how I build the characters,

58
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:38,712
it's, oh, when somebody asks me for feedback in their work,

59
00:03:38,712 --> 00:03:40,773
it's like, it's always, I go to the same point,

60
00:03:40,773 --> 00:03:43,576
like, there are some principles that you,

61
00:03:43,576 --> 00:03:46,317
a lot of people just tend to forget very easy.

62
00:03:46,317 --> 00:03:48,439
Problem solving is your most valuable skill

63
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:50,881
when working in a small team,

64
00:03:50,881 --> 00:03:53,042
because in my case, I was the,

65
00:03:53,042 --> 00:03:54,644
I was pretty much the only one working in Maya,

66
00:03:54,644 --> 00:03:56,565
so if I have a problem with Maya,

67
00:03:56,565 --> 00:03:57,926
it's up to me to figure it out.

68
00:03:58,748 --> 00:04:00,810
Also, since the project is secret,

69
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:03,473
so there is no way for me to ask somebody else.

70
00:04:03,473 --> 00:04:05,915
I'm pretty much on my own in that sense.

71
00:04:05,915 --> 00:04:09,939
Expand your skill sets in the interest

72
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:12,081
of expressing the character's personality.

73
00:04:12,081 --> 00:04:16,185
I think I learned modeling, but that was like,

74
00:04:16,185 --> 00:04:18,527
I was actually, that was not my major,

75
00:04:18,527 --> 00:04:20,469
but something that I was curious to see

76
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:22,411
how I can actually improve the...

77
00:04:23,883 --> 00:04:31,069
the appeal of the characters, how can I actually get them to look and to feel more real in

78
00:04:31,069 --> 00:04:31,469
a sense.

79
00:04:31,469 --> 00:04:42,658
So we have a 2D engine, so all the characters are rendered from multiple camera angles.

80
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:49,524
The modeling and rigging have a similar approach to TV or film, which is like we use high poly

81
00:04:49,524 --> 00:04:50,945
models.

82
00:04:50,945 --> 00:04:53,607
That means fewer technical problems for me in that sense.

83
00:04:54,605 --> 00:05:01,449
Modeling part, as I was saying, like design, I started with a ZBrush exploration of the

84
00:05:01,449 --> 00:05:05,192
modeling, like for the modeling.

85
00:05:05,192 --> 00:05:10,055
In this part, there is still, even though I already get like a design concept for like

86
00:05:10,055 --> 00:05:15,198
from the art director, I still trying to figure out how can we improve the design.

87
00:05:15,198 --> 00:05:21,482
So I know, so like what kind of elements we want to emphasize in the isometric view, because

88
00:05:21,482 --> 00:05:22,703
that's a totally different.

89
00:05:24,059 --> 00:05:25,260
When you're thinking about the character,

90
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,521
it's a totally different beast.

91
00:05:27,521 --> 00:05:31,684
Again, principles of character design,

92
00:05:31,684 --> 00:05:33,945
it's all the way in straight versus curved

93
00:05:33,945 --> 00:05:34,926
and contrast, rhythm,

94
00:05:34,926 --> 00:05:37,587
and all those things are actually applied

95
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,448
in every part of the design,

96
00:05:39,448 --> 00:05:44,851
like the arms, the legs, the head, everything.

97
00:05:44,851 --> 00:05:46,652
This is early exploration for Pyre.

98
00:05:46,652 --> 00:05:48,874
Again, I'm still thinking about all those things

99
00:05:48,874 --> 00:05:49,814
in the character,

100
00:05:49,814 --> 00:05:52,416
trying to facilitate the line of action,

101
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:53,537
the flow of the shapes.

102
00:05:54,063 --> 00:05:56,666
What is the part of the center of attention in the character?

103
00:05:56,666 --> 00:06:02,152
Like what kind of things I want to emphasize in the design and also like in this case

104
00:06:02,152 --> 00:06:06,296
I'm hoping like this kind of shapes are actually showing more of the personality like for this one

105
00:06:06,296 --> 00:06:09,139
It was like something that feels more elegant in that sense

106
00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:22,112
So my part of my process is also I mean like once I receive the concept

107
00:06:22,112 --> 00:06:25,595
I part of my process is actually to improve it in some way like try to figure out

108
00:06:25,595 --> 00:06:29,298
So for some of the problems and why it's not working

109
00:06:29,298 --> 00:06:33,061
Why it's not like a fully like something that we love exactly so I

110
00:06:33,061 --> 00:06:37,184
here's that sketch that I received from the

111
00:06:37,184 --> 00:06:39,506
from the art director and then

112
00:06:39,506 --> 00:06:43,008
Kind of like she gave me an opportunity to actually sort of like explore

113
00:06:43,008 --> 00:06:45,210
our design

114
00:06:46,148 --> 00:06:47,049
options for the sword.

115
00:06:47,049 --> 00:06:52,770
So I went and I just did a lot of tapering on the shape,

116
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:59,132
and then I added some real on the lower part of the sword.

117
00:06:59,132 --> 00:07:03,593
So those kind of small elements, later on,

118
00:07:03,593 --> 00:07:07,894
we start to improve.

119
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:15,396
But it's still my job to actually add

120
00:07:16,118 --> 00:07:17,619
the original design.

121
00:07:17,619 --> 00:07:21,102
Next thing is rigging.

122
00:07:21,102 --> 00:07:27,045
This is super cliche, but I think

123
00:07:27,045 --> 00:07:29,267
it's very important, at least for me,

124
00:07:29,267 --> 00:07:31,788
since I'm not the only one working on this,

125
00:07:31,788 --> 00:07:35,070
is to keep it simple.

126
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,491
Like, a lot of animators, they tend

127
00:07:36,491 --> 00:07:38,333
to be intimidated by this process.

128
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,714
But as long as you have a basic understanding,

129
00:07:40,714 --> 00:07:42,975
like the basic principles of rigging,

130
00:07:42,975 --> 00:07:45,637
you can get to build pretty much anything you want.

131
00:07:46,493 --> 00:07:49,555
And to me, some pen and paper planning,

132
00:07:49,555 --> 00:07:53,738
actually going to try to figure out what I really need

133
00:07:53,738 --> 00:07:56,140
and what kind of contours I really need.

134
00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:00,222
So it's kind of like saved me a lot of time.

135
00:08:00,222 --> 00:08:03,084
And then I get to realize that with very simple tools,

136
00:08:03,084 --> 00:08:05,546
I get to build any kind of character.

137
00:08:05,546 --> 00:08:07,147
Yeah, plenty of plugins out there for that.

138
00:08:07,147 --> 00:08:11,950
So you need to explore the tools that you can find outside.

139
00:08:14,205 --> 00:08:20,911
I still, in this process, I'm still, again, considering design principles, because I want

140
00:08:20,911 --> 00:08:27,777
to make sure that some of those concepts are still applied in the character in animation.

141
00:08:27,777 --> 00:08:31,440
So I need to figure out how many contours I'm going to have based on that.

142
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:37,685
If I want to get more straight and curves in the character, in the poses, the contrast,

143
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:42,469
rhythm, readability, personality, all those things are considered during the reading process.

144
00:08:43,258 --> 00:08:45,899
I need to figure out how many contours I'm gonna have,

145
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:49,842
how many plane shapes I need to add

146
00:08:49,842 --> 00:08:58,107
to the character and things like that.

147
00:08:58,107 --> 00:09:01,148
Yeah, so basically also, again,

148
00:09:01,148 --> 00:09:03,590
it's another thing that I need to keep in mind,

149
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:07,052
really, what kind of parts I want them to be.

150
00:09:07,052 --> 00:09:10,974
The principle is something solid versus flexible.

151
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:13,458
That's something that I add in the character

152
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:16,200
to make sure that some parts are still very rigid,

153
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,981
but you have the freedom to,

154
00:09:17,981 --> 00:09:21,023
there are parts to be more flexible.

155
00:09:21,023 --> 00:09:29,509
The way that I approach this is basically

156
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:32,191
I break everything into models.

157
00:09:32,191 --> 00:09:36,254
I think it's, for example, for this camera,

158
00:09:36,254 --> 00:09:38,735
everything was built in three sections.

159
00:09:38,735 --> 00:09:40,857
It was the main body, the platform, and the horn.

160
00:09:42,155 --> 00:09:44,756
And then I worked individually in every piece.

161
00:09:44,756 --> 00:09:48,158
That was, for me, very easy just to soften a rigging problem

162
00:09:48,158 --> 00:09:51,260
without thinking about the whole thing, which

163
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:54,021
is kind of like, it can be very overwhelming.

164
00:09:54,021 --> 00:09:56,543
So dividing it this way was way easier.

165
00:09:56,543 --> 00:09:59,044
And later on, during production, the designers

166
00:09:59,044 --> 00:10:01,706
decided they wanted the caravan to fly.

167
00:10:01,706 --> 00:10:03,386
So in the same sense, because everything

168
00:10:03,386 --> 00:10:04,727
was built this way, it was very easy for me

169
00:10:04,727 --> 00:10:07,589
to add another model to the rig, and then just add wings.

170
00:10:07,589 --> 00:10:11,151
And then later on, they wanted to be underwater.

171
00:10:11,151 --> 00:10:11,211
So.

172
00:10:12,962 --> 00:10:13,863
That was another option.

173
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,904
So it was like, by having everything breaking down this way,

174
00:10:16,904 --> 00:10:20,486
it was way easier just for me to add and then to animate.

175
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:22,947
So some of those things, like for example,

176
00:10:22,947 --> 00:10:26,008
for the caravan in Pyre, that was something

177
00:10:26,008 --> 00:10:30,510
that I learned from working in Transistor,

178
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,911
which is basically all the same principles,

179
00:10:32,911 --> 00:10:36,113
like once you break the rig into very simple models,

180
00:10:36,113 --> 00:10:39,114
simple sections, like the eyebrows are just one section,

181
00:10:39,114 --> 00:10:40,935
eyelids are another section.

182
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,282
the jaw is another section, so kind of like that,

183
00:10:44,282 --> 00:10:47,383
this mindset kind of helped me to just do it again

184
00:10:47,383 --> 00:10:49,444
and again in different rigs.

185
00:10:49,444 --> 00:10:51,405
Like in this case, the other thing,

186
00:10:51,405 --> 00:10:57,428
like it's a very small company.

187
00:10:57,428 --> 00:11:00,989
So basically, sometimes if I want to try something,

188
00:11:00,989 --> 00:11:02,650
like in this case, the facial rig,

189
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:07,672
it's pretty much like, I mean, it's up to me in many cases,

190
00:11:07,672 --> 00:11:10,394
like I have the freedom to just explore whatever I want to

191
00:11:10,394 --> 00:11:11,414
in the character, so.

192
00:11:12,207 --> 00:11:14,669
in some point that there were like a period of time

193
00:11:14,669 --> 00:11:15,750
I didn't have that much to do,

194
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,832
so I decided to figure out how to rig the face.

195
00:11:19,832 --> 00:11:22,234
And then that's sort of like,

196
00:11:22,234 --> 00:11:24,575
I've been using that for a while after that.

197
00:11:24,575 --> 00:11:25,096
Next is animation.

198
00:11:25,096 --> 00:11:25,896
So everything is,

199
00:11:25,896 --> 00:11:29,539
basically everything is like between 60 to 64 camera angles.

200
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,631
And average is like 2,500 PNGs per animation.

201
00:11:43,631 --> 00:11:45,793
Everything is rendered.

202
00:11:45,793 --> 00:11:48,595
Like I just be ready for all the rendering.

203
00:11:48,595 --> 00:11:50,196
All the lighting is attached to the camera.

204
00:11:50,196 --> 00:11:52,778
So this is like the way that I

205
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:55,240
produce all the animations basically.

206
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,323
Yeah, the lighting is attached to the camera,

207
00:11:59,323 --> 00:12:02,005
so basically the lighting is also rotating

208
00:12:02,005 --> 00:12:03,285
around the character the whole time.

209
00:12:03,285 --> 00:12:04,366
So some of the key lengths for.

210
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:12,590
For animating isometric, for me, it's like,

211
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:16,111
at least eight angles should communicate

212
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:18,872
the main idea of the animation.

213
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:21,713
So I start with the basic eight angles

214
00:12:21,713 --> 00:12:24,333
that the character's gonna be in.

215
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:26,354
And I draw in the viewport in those eight angles

216
00:12:26,354 --> 00:12:27,374
to figure out the shape.

217
00:12:27,374 --> 00:12:31,215
This is super, this is one of the key things for me

218
00:12:31,215 --> 00:12:33,276
because every time that I'm not actually animating.

219
00:12:34,682 --> 00:12:38,704
And I'm stuck, because I feel like it doesn't look as good

220
00:12:38,704 --> 00:12:40,765
as I was expecting it to be.

221
00:12:40,765 --> 00:12:43,326
I just go back and I draw over that,

222
00:12:43,326 --> 00:12:46,108
and that's completely different.

223
00:12:46,108 --> 00:12:49,670
You immediately see a difference between what you were thinking

224
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:52,111
and when you actually draw on the viewport.

225
00:12:52,111 --> 00:12:54,772
Yeah, so in this process, I'm still

226
00:12:54,772 --> 00:12:57,594
continuing adjusting the main angles,

227
00:12:57,594 --> 00:12:59,995
like line of action, tilt, twist, flow, shapes,

228
00:12:59,995 --> 00:13:00,555
all those things.

229
00:13:01,388 --> 00:13:03,189
There is still color adjustment that

230
00:13:03,189 --> 00:13:05,310
are happening in this process because at this point,

231
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:09,252
we're starting to see a character in the isometric

232
00:13:09,252 --> 00:13:11,893
and in the game, combined with all the other assets,

233
00:13:11,893 --> 00:13:12,674
the environment.

234
00:13:12,674 --> 00:13:14,535
So we need to adjust it.

235
00:13:14,535 --> 00:13:16,095
I work with the art director to figure out

236
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:18,716
how can we improve the color in the character.

237
00:13:18,716 --> 00:13:21,878
And the last part of this process, to me,

238
00:13:21,878 --> 00:13:25,920
is adding a lot of in-between blend shapes.

239
00:13:32,927 --> 00:13:35,667
So I use a tool that is called Shapes for Maya.

240
00:13:35,667 --> 00:13:39,888
It's been very useful for me

241
00:13:39,888 --> 00:13:42,829
because I like it to do like corrective blend shapes

242
00:13:42,829 --> 00:13:44,109
and sometimes like actually,

243
00:13:44,109 --> 00:13:46,229
and I get to animate between them

244
00:13:46,229 --> 00:13:49,150
and blend them doing that process.

245
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:49,290
So,

246
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:56,351
it's sort of like, because my rigging is still,

247
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:58,812
sometimes in the rigging process is not enough

248
00:13:58,812 --> 00:14:00,812
but you have the shape that you can get.

249
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,162
This is the last step in the process where I go

250
00:14:04,162 --> 00:14:07,024
and actually polish the silhouette more.

251
00:14:07,024 --> 00:14:08,946
Polish the shape that I want more.

252
00:14:08,946 --> 00:14:12,169
Performance, this is another part.

253
00:14:12,169 --> 00:14:20,296
Since we are doing RPGs, there are moments in the story

254
00:14:20,296 --> 00:14:24,559
where we need very specific animations

255
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:27,742
that follow the story.

256
00:14:28,439 --> 00:14:31,381
The way that I work on this is I break down the main ideas

257
00:14:31,381 --> 00:14:33,282
of the animation.

258
00:14:33,282 --> 00:14:36,745
Those main ideas define how much it's going

259
00:14:36,745 --> 00:14:38,486
to take me to produce them.

260
00:14:38,486 --> 00:14:41,268
Of course, I need to answer all the questions about what

261
00:14:41,268 --> 00:14:44,170
is the character emotional state, where

262
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:46,832
is the character coming from, and how much time do

263
00:14:46,832 --> 00:14:48,433
I have to animate those things.

264
00:14:48,433 --> 00:14:51,835
So based on that, I need to find a balance between what I can

265
00:14:51,835 --> 00:14:52,996
do in the time that I have.

266
00:14:58,615 --> 00:14:59,815
Yeah, OK.

267
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:07,858
Another key thing for me, like working at Supergiant Games,

268
00:15:07,858 --> 00:15:10,699
I think I'm working with designers.

269
00:15:10,699 --> 00:15:15,541
I start to use locators a lot.

270
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:18,042
That was something that I learned way before,

271
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,203
but I never actually got to implement it.

272
00:15:20,203 --> 00:15:24,504
Like in every animation that I do now,

273
00:15:24,504 --> 00:15:26,625
there is at least one or two locators.

274
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:29,720
Because this is the way that I can actually work,

275
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,200
like figure out the timing for the animations very quick.

276
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:36,601
And then also, I just the timing, work with the designers,

277
00:15:36,601 --> 00:15:39,142
see if it's working, see if it's like combined

278
00:15:39,142 --> 00:15:40,622
with other animations is working well.

279
00:15:40,622 --> 00:15:44,963
And then after that, I can actually go and animate

280
00:15:44,963 --> 00:15:45,783
the rest of the body.

281
00:15:45,783 --> 00:15:49,864
So that way, like I'm not spending a huge amount of time

282
00:15:49,864 --> 00:15:51,145
animating the whole character.

283
00:15:51,145 --> 00:15:53,745
I just like animating like simple locators.

284
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:56,126
And then I define like the, I just add like a box.

285
00:15:57,347 --> 00:16:02,991
I parent them to a box so I can sort of get a sense of the volume.

286
00:16:02,991 --> 00:16:06,073
That's enough for me to actually work to show the designers basically.

287
00:16:06,073 --> 00:16:18,762
So yeah, okay, so basically in this case there is one locator that is sort of defining the translation and the character.

288
00:16:18,762 --> 00:16:22,124
Translation in Y and then there is another one for the rotation

289
00:16:22,124 --> 00:16:26,127
and then there is a third one for the translation in C of the main character.

290
00:16:26,892 --> 00:16:33,035
That's happened from the beginning, like at the beginning I was just exploring just with one simple locator, then I add like another one.

291
00:16:33,035 --> 00:16:41,918
Still I was not happy with the result, so I add the third one, move the character and start to change the position of the character.

292
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:43,959
So that was like pretty useful.

293
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:51,662
See if I want to, in this case, if I want to, for some reason the designer want me to, they want the character to jump even higher,

294
00:16:51,662 --> 00:16:56,204
it was very, very simple for me to just adjust that, like very quick.

295
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:01,358
Similar idea here, this is a main locator

296
00:17:01,358 --> 00:17:03,219
that is actually driving the main animation.

297
00:17:03,219 --> 00:17:10,660
And then there's another one for the character going down.

298
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:13,101
I'm gonna show you another one.

299
00:17:13,101 --> 00:17:19,842
This is a, like, this is a, in Transistor,

300
00:17:19,842 --> 00:17:21,843
this is what, like, one of the key elements,

301
00:17:21,843 --> 00:17:26,103
like, I was using the locator just to drive the sword.

302
00:17:26,639 --> 00:17:30,240
The sword was so big that it was the main thing that when you see an isometric,

303
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,181
you are like the main thing that you're going to see.

304
00:17:32,181 --> 00:17:34,122
So to me, I was like the most important for the designers.

305
00:17:34,122 --> 00:17:37,643
Also very important that you get like.

306
00:17:37,643 --> 00:17:41,685
You get to read what is happening with the sword from the beginning.

307
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:46,787
So this is what I what we render and we tested in the game.

308
00:17:46,787 --> 00:17:50,128
And after that, I just go and animate the rest of the body.

309
00:17:50,128 --> 00:17:50,768
Some cases.

310
00:17:51,428 --> 00:17:55,029
It's fine because in some cases I didn't even know what it was going to do.

311
00:17:55,029 --> 00:17:59,710
I just knew exactly what we wanted the sword to do and then based on that I have to figure

312
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:00,951
out the rest.

313
00:18:00,951 --> 00:18:07,432
So it's like an inverse process in this case, which works really well because the designers

314
00:18:07,432 --> 00:18:12,394
just get an idea of what is going to happen in that animation way before I animate anything

315
00:18:12,394 --> 00:18:12,754
else.

316
00:18:20,544 --> 00:18:22,805
So yeah, I keep with the locators,

317
00:18:22,805 --> 00:18:25,066
it kind of helps me to keep everything very clean.

318
00:18:25,066 --> 00:18:28,007
Like here's an example of one of the locators,

319
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:31,208
like this is figuring out when the character is going down

320
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:34,309
and then also the hips are like the intersection

321
00:18:34,309 --> 00:18:35,890
and then you can see how here,

322
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:38,791
all I transfer everything to the locators

323
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:42,832
and also the rotation of the character is one,

324
00:18:42,832 --> 00:18:45,413
it's based on one locator and then the hips are like,

325
00:18:45,413 --> 00:18:48,834
I add extra small details to what I want the character to do.

326
00:18:48,834 --> 00:18:49,935
That was like.

327
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:54,439
During part, that was very important,

328
00:18:54,439 --> 00:18:57,181
because the timing of those locators,

329
00:18:57,181 --> 00:18:59,582
actually, I just reused them for every other animation.

330
00:18:59,582 --> 00:19:04,445
Since everything here has to be synced with the effects,

331
00:19:04,445 --> 00:19:06,125
with all the elements that designers are doing,

332
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,106
so the timing has to be very specific.

333
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:11,488
So to make sure that we don't waste a lot of time

334
00:19:11,488 --> 00:19:13,169
like trying to adjust the timing

335
00:19:13,169 --> 00:19:14,430
to a very specific animation,

336
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:17,171
it was very serious to me to replace the character.

337
00:19:19,226 --> 00:19:23,589
the time is already there, so it was very easy to just add

338
00:19:23,589 --> 00:19:26,171
a new character to those locators.

339
00:19:26,171 --> 00:19:40,961
So OK, so yeah, that's part of the process for me

340
00:19:40,961 --> 00:19:42,262
is rendering.

341
00:19:42,262 --> 00:19:44,183
We have a render farm in the office.

342
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:47,806
Everything is exported in EXR format.

343
00:19:48,467 --> 00:19:54,830
multi channels. I combine all those layers in After Effects and also the shadows are

344
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:59,913
baked into the final render. Canvas size is between 300 by 300, 1024 by 1024. It takes

345
00:19:59,913 --> 00:20:08,597
like three to seven hours of rendering per animation. That's something I need to be aware

346
00:20:08,597 --> 00:20:13,699
when I'm working because I have to wait like three hours to see an animation actually working

347
00:20:13,699 --> 00:20:16,020
in the game. So I usually have like...

348
00:20:17,853 --> 00:20:20,695
Plenty of other animations at the same time that I'm doing,

349
00:20:20,695 --> 00:20:22,776
because I have to wait for rendering time.

350
00:20:22,776 --> 00:20:28,921
This is the last part of the process.

351
00:20:28,921 --> 00:20:33,264
After that, so I still, after that,

352
00:20:33,264 --> 00:20:38,187
so basically we need to, we are trying to also,

353
00:20:38,187 --> 00:20:42,150
as part of my job, we are also trying to figure out

354
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:46,813
what kind of merchandise we can do for the fans.

355
00:20:46,813 --> 00:20:47,073
So.

356
00:20:47,877 --> 00:20:54,920
like this is like the art direction that I go in this in this project was to make it look like candy that was like

357
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,581
the main concept

358
00:20:56,581 --> 00:21:01,403
and then based on that I still have to keep all those ideas that we had in the original design like all

359
00:21:01,403 --> 00:21:03,785
all those shapes and how they combine

360
00:21:03,785 --> 00:21:08,327
if you have everything very like it's still very clear, so it's very

361
00:21:08,327 --> 00:21:11,108
It should be very easy just to translate those to something new

362
00:21:15,185 --> 00:21:25,252
Yeah, this is another example of all the things that I do when we are not working in any game at all.

363
00:21:25,252 --> 00:21:27,614
Things that we do for PAX.

364
00:21:27,614 --> 00:21:35,360
I'm still exploring, like 3D printing, see how the characters look, like a real figure, things like that.

365
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:41,024
This is, yeah, so again, I think when you are working with external contractors,

366
00:21:41,024 --> 00:21:44,527
I think it's very important that you are very specific about...

367
00:21:45,495 --> 00:21:49,618
about the design because a lot of, probably 80% of the time,

368
00:21:49,618 --> 00:21:52,921
they will do something different.

369
00:21:52,921 --> 00:21:59,066
So the more information you give them, the better.

370
00:21:59,066 --> 00:22:01,748
So they actually don't let them come up

371
00:22:01,748 --> 00:22:05,871
with some interpretations of what they think it is.

372
00:22:05,871 --> 00:22:08,573
Because it's usually, I mean, it took a long time

373
00:22:08,573 --> 00:22:12,076
to figure this out, so you try to make sure

374
00:22:12,076 --> 00:22:14,578
that it stills be true to the.

375
00:22:15,368 --> 00:22:16,688
to the game.

376
00:22:16,688 --> 00:22:28,451
Last thing I want to mention here, I think it's like, I think it's important that you

377
00:22:28,451 --> 00:22:36,954
still have a point of view of what you do, because I think for me at least, when I got

378
00:22:36,954 --> 00:22:41,275
hired to design games, I didn't have any experience in games, and I actually didn't have any proof

379
00:22:41,275 --> 00:22:44,436
of previous work, but I think what I feel the main reason

380
00:22:45,118 --> 00:22:51,521
for them to hire me was because I have like a very specific voice in the work that I was doing.

381
00:22:51,521 --> 00:23:00,825
So even though I didn't have anything, I didn't understand at all how to make a game basically.

382
00:23:00,825 --> 00:23:08,228
So yeah, I think and basically you still need to have a specific point of view what you do,

383
00:23:08,228 --> 00:23:13,270
but also work with the constraints of the of the product because it's still at the end.

384
00:23:14,048 --> 00:23:18,051
Even though it's a very small team, you are still part of a group of people and we are

385
00:23:18,051 --> 00:23:22,575
trying, all of us, we are trying to push a specific idea.

386
00:23:22,575 --> 00:23:29,781
So like right now, actually right now we are looking for a 3D artist in the company and

387
00:23:29,781 --> 00:23:35,285
then one of the things that I'm considering a lot is like somebody that can actually understand

388
00:23:35,285 --> 00:23:40,870
drawing very well because that's, even though the modeling part is not really good, but

389
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:42,031
if they actually understand.

390
00:23:42,638 --> 00:23:46,401
if you can see in the drawing and you can see how they interpreted those shapes in drawing

391
00:23:46,401 --> 00:23:50,943
and then you can tell that, I mean you can see how they are the way they are thinking

392
00:23:50,943 --> 00:23:56,686
so it's very easy for if they are not really good at ZBrush but they get the idea so it's

393
00:23:56,686 --> 00:23:59,888
very easy just to translate that into 3D layer, just a matter of time.

394
00:23:59,888 --> 00:24:07,232
Things that I like also I want to mention like

395
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:15,707
Took me a while while working on Supergiant, I think it took me like two years to actually understand like that.

396
00:24:15,707 --> 00:24:21,450
Other parts of your life are actually affecting the quality of your work.

397
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:21,590
So

398
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:27,633
You have to deal with all the stuff like apart from like life that for some reason

399
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:28,434
Yeah, it's not working.

400
00:24:28,434 --> 00:24:36,078
I'm very careful about not having crutch time, like I haven't had any crutch time in five and a half years at Supergiant Games.

401
00:24:36,999 --> 00:24:38,900
I, at 6 p.m., I leave the office,

402
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,820
and no matter what happens.

403
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:46,281
I have worked remotely from five different countries.

404
00:24:46,281 --> 00:24:49,262
I think the company is very small, it's very flexible.

405
00:24:49,262 --> 00:24:50,903
The rules are very flexible, so you are,

406
00:24:50,903 --> 00:24:54,464
it's give me a free one to actually go and travel,

407
00:24:54,464 --> 00:24:57,084
and still do my work from any place.

408
00:24:57,084 --> 00:25:01,105
I'm actually also working on other art projects

409
00:25:01,105 --> 00:25:05,026
and exhibitions, toy design, video, photography.

410
00:25:05,026 --> 00:25:06,147
And I'm still taking classes.

411
00:25:06,624 --> 00:25:10,287
Because it's already like five and a half years,

412
00:25:10,287 --> 00:25:14,870
but still there's a lot of things that I need to improve.

413
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:15,850
So the main things for me to do,

414
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:23,055
that I want to emphasize, of course,

415
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:27,418
was character design mindset to entire pipeline.

416
00:25:27,418 --> 00:25:29,459
So I need to be aware in the whole process.

417
00:25:29,459 --> 00:25:35,843
And keep that always in mind in the entire production.

418
00:25:37,027 --> 00:25:38,867
Problem solving is your most valuable skill.

419
00:25:38,867 --> 00:25:43,088
This is going to show every time at work, like every week,

420
00:25:43,088 --> 00:25:46,109
there is something that you need to figure out in the time.

421
00:25:46,109 --> 00:25:50,811
Usually, it's usually Maya with some crash or something.

422
00:25:50,811 --> 00:25:56,152
Seek opportunities to expand your skill set.

423
00:25:56,152 --> 00:26:00,394
I think it's also, I see a lot of people that get stuck

424
00:26:00,394 --> 00:26:02,354
in being an animator, and then they

425
00:26:02,354 --> 00:26:03,795
don't try to explore any other options.

426
00:26:04,837 --> 00:26:06,697
And then I see there's a lot of companies now,

427
00:26:06,697 --> 00:26:10,579
they just hire people for like a specific task.

428
00:26:10,579 --> 00:26:14,881
So I think it's expanding those skills,

429
00:26:14,881 --> 00:26:17,782
it's always like valuable for the team,

430
00:26:17,782 --> 00:26:20,583
valuable for the way that you work with other people.

431
00:26:20,583 --> 00:26:23,704
So I think it's important to just like,

432
00:26:23,704 --> 00:26:25,825
it's something that you can try on your own,

433
00:26:25,825 --> 00:26:28,426
like from time to time, so it's not,

434
00:26:28,426 --> 00:26:30,247
so you are not getting stuck in just animating.

435
00:26:30,247 --> 00:26:32,068
And it's all in the interest

436
00:26:32,068 --> 00:26:34,068
of expressing the character's personality.

437
00:26:35,167 --> 00:26:38,751
So, yeah.

438
00:26:38,751 --> 00:26:39,151
That's it.

439
00:26:39,151 --> 00:26:52,024
APPLAUSE

440
00:26:52,024 --> 00:26:55,968
Yeah. Any questions?

441
00:26:55,968 --> 00:26:56,529
Questions?

442
00:27:08,033 --> 00:27:08,474
Is this working?

443
00:27:08,474 --> 00:27:11,577
So you were saying about the render time thing.

444
00:27:11,577 --> 00:27:13,539
I was just curious.

445
00:27:13,539 --> 00:27:15,721
But you also showed more pre-busy thing where, hey,

446
00:27:15,721 --> 00:27:16,681
it's just the sword moving.

447
00:27:16,681 --> 00:27:20,325
I assume that doing a render with just the one element

448
00:27:20,325 --> 00:27:24,929
moving, whatever, you could test that in game quicker than three

449
00:27:24,929 --> 00:27:26,571
hours or whatever the timing was.

450
00:27:26,571 --> 00:27:26,711
Yeah.

451
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:29,493
Yeah, you still have to render it.

452
00:27:29,493 --> 00:27:32,976
But basically, it's quicker because I

453
00:27:32,976 --> 00:27:34,478
don't have to animate the rest of the body.

454
00:27:35,471 --> 00:27:38,754
So I can do that in like probably 10 minutes,

455
00:27:38,754 --> 00:27:42,537
render that, and then show it to the designers.

456
00:27:42,537 --> 00:27:45,119
And then from that, we decided to give the time,

457
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:46,420
and it's right.

458
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,102
And after that, I go and I do the animation,

459
00:27:48,102 --> 00:27:50,043
which the animation will take like a day or two or three,

460
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:52,085
whatever it takes.

461
00:27:52,085 --> 00:27:52,405
Yeah.

462
00:27:52,405 --> 00:27:54,587
Just if I could have one more question as well.

463
00:27:54,587 --> 00:27:57,469
You seem to essentially own the

464
00:27:58,597 --> 00:28:06,883
Entire pipeline and I'm curious because there's a there's another person at the studio who's the like arts director. Is that correct?

465
00:28:06,883 --> 00:28:08,844
yeah, so how does the

466
00:28:08,844 --> 00:28:17,170
How do the two of you work together because you have like such an incredible fine-grained control over the end

467
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:20,772
product presumably you you guys must have to have a

468
00:28:20,772 --> 00:28:24,315
Very good working relationship because she's it's I don't know who is but

469
00:28:26,813 --> 00:28:36,295
Yeah, it's like you are this single focused point through which everything is getting put on screen.

470
00:28:36,295 --> 00:28:37,755
Wait, again, it's about how I work with like...

471
00:28:37,755 --> 00:28:42,216
Yeah, yeah, how does that relationship work, like making these games?

472
00:28:42,216 --> 00:28:49,057
Because it's unusual for someone to so entirely own the pipeline.

473
00:28:49,057 --> 00:28:51,378
Well, it's... I think...

474
00:28:51,378 --> 00:28:53,558
It's...

475
00:28:53,558 --> 00:28:56,338
I don't even know how to put it, because I think it's like, it's...

476
00:28:57,597 --> 00:28:58,257
It's been a while.

477
00:28:58,257 --> 00:29:00,238
At the beginning, it was like,

478
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:03,279
we get, I just like to understand what the 2D is,

479
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:06,060
like the concept, like the art director,

480
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:08,440
what she was doing and the style.

481
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,322
So I need to like, I still need to like think about that,

482
00:29:11,322 --> 00:29:12,802
but like in some point,

483
00:29:12,802 --> 00:29:16,283
we know each other very well.

484
00:29:16,283 --> 00:29:18,004
So it's very easy just for us to,

485
00:29:18,004 --> 00:29:21,125
I got, I'm already guessing what she's gonna say.

486
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:23,426
And she's already guessing what I'm gonna say.

487
00:29:23,426 --> 00:29:24,626
So kind of like at this point,

488
00:29:24,626 --> 00:29:24,726
it's

489
00:29:26,129 --> 00:29:30,452
We don't need to communicate that much about that kind of stuff because we already know

490
00:29:30,452 --> 00:29:34,555
what is going to happen more or less.

491
00:29:34,555 --> 00:29:35,276
If that makes sense.

492
00:29:35,276 --> 00:29:35,596
Thank you.

493
00:29:35,596 --> 00:29:35,876
That's great.

494
00:29:35,876 --> 00:29:35,956
Hi.

495
00:29:35,956 --> 00:29:42,161
You were saying you're from Colombia?

496
00:29:42,161 --> 00:29:42,501
Yeah.

497
00:29:42,501 --> 00:29:44,743
I'm from Latin America too.

498
00:29:44,743 --> 00:29:53,349
Many of the shapes and color choices and way to stylize some of the characters ring very

499
00:29:53,349 --> 00:29:53,950
familiar.

500
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:57,932
from Colombia that bleeds through the project,

501
00:29:57,932 --> 00:30:03,315
like that ends up being part of like your work?

502
00:30:03,315 --> 00:30:06,517
There is, I mean,

503
00:30:06,517 --> 00:30:09,158
there is some characters actually,

504
00:30:09,158 --> 00:30:11,859
I don't have them here,

505
00:30:11,859 --> 00:30:15,821
but like there is some characters actually there.

506
00:30:15,821 --> 00:30:19,783
I actually did them dancing on salsa.

507
00:30:19,783 --> 00:30:22,645
It's, but yeah, so from time to time,

508
00:30:22,645 --> 00:30:24,386
there's stuff like that that I do.

509
00:30:24,386 --> 00:30:24,846
Yeah, definitely.

510
00:30:26,471 --> 00:30:27,131
Oh yeah?

511
00:30:27,131 --> 00:30:27,511
Yeah.

512
00:30:27,511 --> 00:30:27,872
Oh, okay.

513
00:30:27,872 --> 00:30:28,292
We're good.

514
00:30:28,292 --> 00:30:29,973
Is it cool if I ask a question?

515
00:30:29,973 --> 00:30:31,233
We're just confirming.

516
00:30:31,233 --> 00:30:32,694
We want really quick.

517
00:30:32,694 --> 00:30:33,014
One more.

518
00:30:33,014 --> 00:30:33,314
Yeah.

519
00:30:33,314 --> 00:30:44,641
So what kind of training resources would you recommend to artists because the part

520
00:30:44,641 --> 00:30:52,185
where you were emphasizing improving your skills really resonates to me as a professional

521
00:30:52,185 --> 00:30:53,866
in the industry.

522
00:30:53,866 --> 00:30:55,206
Well, I...

523
00:30:56,693 --> 00:31:00,095
I take classes everywhere, but I think it's like I'm always trying to figure out, I try

524
00:31:00,095 --> 00:31:02,796
to find the right teachers because that's like the key element.

525
00:31:02,796 --> 00:31:11,641
Sometimes you find a good class, but it's probably not, I mean you have to find the

526
00:31:11,641 --> 00:31:12,902
right mentors basically.

527
00:31:12,902 --> 00:31:16,804
So you have to find and then which ones are the kind of people that you want to learn

528
00:31:16,804 --> 00:31:17,244
from.

529
00:31:17,244 --> 00:31:23,548
So I don't have like a specific resources that I will suggest.

530
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:24,588
You need to explore.

531
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:27,017
depends on animation, it's always different.

532
00:31:27,017 --> 00:31:29,959
But like, rigging is also different.

533
00:31:29,959 --> 00:31:31,540
Like, some of the rigging that I learned

534
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,782
was from a guy from Naughty Dog,

535
00:31:33,782 --> 00:31:35,903
was a really amazing teacher.

536
00:31:35,903 --> 00:31:36,624
But like, there is also, I mean,

537
00:31:36,624 --> 00:31:39,106
it's always like different places, so.

538
00:31:39,106 --> 00:31:42,968
And then you have to be very open, like sometimes,

539
00:31:42,968 --> 00:31:45,550
like some of the classes that I take,

540
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:48,792
they are like, terrible.

541
00:31:48,792 --> 00:31:52,235
But it happens, but you stay, I mean,

542
00:31:52,235 --> 00:31:54,677
you always find something out there, but yeah.

543
00:31:55,094 --> 00:31:56,616
Okay, so trial and error.

544
00:31:56,616 --> 00:31:57,678
Yeah, pretty much.

545
00:31:57,678 --> 00:32:00,382
Are you going online or in person typically?

546
00:32:00,382 --> 00:32:01,183
Yeah.

547
00:32:01,183 --> 00:32:03,346
Okay, thanks.
