1
00:00:03,201 --> 00:00:03,342
so

2
00:00:12,213 --> 00:00:13,974
We're going to talk about Bear and Breakfast.

3
00:00:15,195 --> 00:00:24,002
For those of you who haven't heard about Bear and Breakfast before, it's a laid-back management adventure game where you build and run a bed and breakfast, but you're a bear.

4
00:00:24,703 --> 00:00:36,272
And that on its own doesn't mean much, especially since PC Gamers said that a laid-back management adventure is whatever your boss is off doing when he takes a two-hour lunch.

5
00:00:36,913 --> 00:00:40,756
So to give you a slightly better clue, we're going to have to watch a very, very short trailer.

6
00:00:56,338 --> 00:01:07,746
So as you can see, the game has some crafting, it has some building, some decorating, some talking, some walking, some heavy UI action, and even a map that we added way too late.

7
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:12,010
But of course, it has its central element there.

8
00:01:13,542 --> 00:01:18,764
And before the game could look like this, unfortunately, it had to look like this.

9
00:01:20,044 --> 00:01:27,527
I don't know why the universe works the way that it does, but it just needed to look this bad so we could all be in a room together.

10
00:01:28,907 --> 00:01:40,511
But anyway, by talking about our game and how we got it from point A to point B, I'll attempt to answer a question that was on my mind while developing it, and maybe some of you have thought of as well before.

11
00:01:41,471 --> 00:01:44,972
How do you approach an increasingly saturated indie scene?

12
00:01:45,012 --> 00:01:46,192
There's so many games out there.

13
00:01:48,033 --> 00:01:57,835
I'll do that by kind of showing you how we tried, failed, and sometimes succeeding at standing out by mixing and bashing a few game genres together.

14
00:01:58,475 --> 00:01:59,455
And I know what you're all thinking.

15
00:01:59,775 --> 00:02:00,436
It's pretty simple.

16
00:02:00,936 --> 00:02:01,676
Just add a bear.

17
00:02:02,816 --> 00:02:07,877
Of course, it's a tried and true tactic that worked for a lot of extraordinary games.

18
00:02:08,397 --> 00:02:10,058
Of course, I'm talking about EnviroBear 2000.

19
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,445
A masterpiece that's such a high level that I still aspire to reach one day.

20
00:02:16,946 --> 00:02:20,711
But before I get too excited about this, I'll tell you a bit about myself.

21
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,152
My name is Rares.

22
00:02:22,813 --> 00:02:26,077
I'm a 30-year-old developer from Romania, which is in Eastern Europe.

23
00:02:26,918 --> 00:02:27,899
I don't know why I picked this photo.

24
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:28,560
This is in France.

25
00:02:29,601 --> 00:02:32,643
Anyway, in 2016, I also started a company called Gummy Cat.

26
00:02:33,464 --> 00:02:36,046
It's a game development studio also based in Romania.

27
00:02:36,566 --> 00:02:40,749
And for the first few years, it was just by me, by myself, just kind of screwing around.

28
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:46,973
And eventually, we kind of began developing Bear and Breakfast as more of a team in about 2020.

29
00:02:48,855 --> 00:02:55,940
With me was Ioana, our art director and my partner, and Andu, who's our programmer, lead programmer.

30
00:02:56,761 --> 00:02:58,344
But wait, we're an indie studio.

31
00:02:58,465 --> 00:02:59,767
That means we wear a lot of hats.

32
00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:02,092
And sometimes against our better judgment.

33
00:03:02,854 --> 00:03:07,876
Um, but wait, we're an indie studio, which meant that we were actually more than just three people.

34
00:03:07,936 --> 00:03:10,977
We were five, but it wasn't for the whole period of time.

35
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:17,579
It was just, so it's weird to define the core team because not everyone worked for the same amount of time, but wait, we're an indie studio.

36
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:25,881
So, uh, that meant that a lot of people actually worked on the game from QA localization, contractors, our publisher also helped.

37
00:03:26,501 --> 00:03:31,803
Um, so it was something like 50 people in the end that just touched the game at some point.

38
00:03:32,882 --> 00:03:42,755
And in any case, I'm going to tell you the story about how we got to doing something that everyone here has either done or aspires to one day do, which is to push this little green button in Steam's backend.

39
00:03:43,837 --> 00:03:48,023
And this, as you all know, is a very relaxing and peaceful experience.

40
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:49,965
It's comparable to a day at the spa.

41
00:03:50,726 --> 00:04:03,122
And in order to do that, I'll just quickly present throughout the whole presentation what we pitched to publishers and investors in the summer of 2019 and compare it to what we eventually launched in the world.

42
00:04:04,253 --> 00:04:08,514
kind of to see if we kept our promise and if we had a through line that survived the whole process.

43
00:04:09,054 --> 00:04:17,995
And as a side note, our pitch was sent to something like 70 publishers and investors, out of which 15 never got back to us at all.

44
00:04:18,856 --> 00:04:20,396
About 25 responded.

45
00:04:20,816 --> 00:04:25,037
And after talking and negotiating, we refused, or we were refused by about 24.

46
00:04:25,577 --> 00:04:32,558
But that's all right, since in the end, we only needed one to sign the game and make it happen, which we did thanks to Armor Games, our publisher.

47
00:04:33,198 --> 00:04:34,919
which some of them are here as well.

48
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,922
And also, our pitch deck is online.

49
00:04:38,122 --> 00:04:42,885
You can actually see it, see the exact thing that we used to pitch the game and get a deal out of it.

50
00:04:43,286 --> 00:04:49,931
It's on this website from a company called Hey Glitch, who have a thing called Founders Kit, also has other pitch decks.

51
00:04:49,991 --> 00:04:50,491
It's really good.

52
00:04:50,551 --> 00:04:51,472
It's a great resource.

53
00:04:51,912 --> 00:04:53,733
You should really see it.

54
00:04:53,994 --> 00:05:01,179
And from now on, if there's ever an image or a slide from our original pitch deck, it'll have this handy little annotation.

55
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,100
Cool.

56
00:05:03,294 --> 00:05:11,161
Just to give you a little bit of insight of what's coming up, I'm going to talk about what blending genres meant to us and kind of our process.

57
00:05:11,461 --> 00:05:28,957
And then we'll tackle the genres that make up Bear and Breakfast, so adventure and management, and kind of like how we blended them together, how we smushed them, what really worked in this process, and then what didn't, or the mistakes that we made along the way.

58
00:05:29,478 --> 00:05:29,638
Cool?

59
00:05:30,373 --> 00:05:30,573
Cool.

60
00:05:30,934 --> 00:05:31,194
Let's go.

61
00:05:32,235 --> 00:05:33,916
So mixing genres.

62
00:05:33,956 --> 00:05:35,137
It's not a novel concept.

63
00:05:35,738 --> 00:05:39,361
It's not like a top 10 secret tactic that publishers will hate you for.

64
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:55,215
There's plenty of games that implement multiple elements from multiple genres all the time, but mostly with budgets much, much higher than what a first time studio from middle of nowhere Eastern Europe could realistically aim for for our first title.

65
00:05:56,695 --> 00:06:03,277
This, like the original pitch back in 2019 promised roughly the same thing as today, a management adventure game.

66
00:06:03,998 --> 00:06:16,341
But if you really think about it, combining genres seems like a straightforward idea for about three seconds until you realize there's like no way you can actually bear the weight of what this kind of combination inherently implies.

67
00:06:16,922 --> 00:06:21,483
And it can be like a very, very daunting and prone to over promise process.

68
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:41,465
So within the context of a small team, with limited budget, limited development time, limited space in our brains, the more genres we aim to combine, the more we'll have to strip away from each of those genres in order to actually ship, let alone to ship something that you're happy with.

69
00:06:42,285 --> 00:06:57,890
um and especially something that players would like because given player expectations and based on like common knowledge and games they've played previously you could easily find yourself in a mess um like too far gone to realistically bring it all together before you launch

70
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:11,094
And yeah, how exactly did we measure or decide on the features of or elements of the genres that we needed to take away from for the game?

71
00:07:11,874 --> 00:07:20,136
I think it's a more complex answer that I could realistically say in a 30 minute lecture, but for us it boiled down to perceived player expectations.

72
00:07:20,616 --> 00:07:26,398
So we had to make a decision pretty early on in the process on which expectations we really aim to fulfill.

73
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:29,661
and which we were okay with kind of disappointing some players on.

74
00:07:30,402 --> 00:07:36,868
It's impossible to meet everyone's expectations anyway and this just added another layer of complexity to the problem.

75
00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:51,733
And then, once you do all of this, you have to hope that your original vision, that you had from the start, is strong enough to hold through all the circles of game development, from pitching to production, and especially marketing.

76
00:07:54,093 --> 00:07:56,234
But let's talk about some concrete examples.

77
00:07:56,254 --> 00:07:58,374
So what makes Barren Breakfast an adventure game?

78
00:07:59,655 --> 00:08:05,256
Let me ask you, what thing pops into your mind if you think about a shooter tag on Steam?

79
00:08:05,516 --> 00:08:06,457
That's pretty straightforward.

80
00:08:06,817 --> 00:08:07,677
But what about adventure?

81
00:08:09,158 --> 00:08:16,583
We called it an adventure game, but we quickly found that it's like, you know, trying to categorize dishes in a restaurant by which ones you salt.

82
00:08:17,243 --> 00:08:23,587
According to Steam Tags, VRChat is an adventure game, but so is God of War, and so is Terraria, and so is Valheim.

83
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:28,490
And that's not really helpful when you're trying to explain what your game is in more detail.

84
00:08:29,457 --> 00:08:40,160
So because of the weight of that adventure qualifier, we decided to focus our efforts on a specific part of the genre that we could actually realistically deliver.

85
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,442
Specifically, we wanted to signal that our game had a rich narrative that would help immerse you in the world.

86
00:08:46,722 --> 00:08:50,223
So for us, adventure in the end just meant story and characters.

87
00:08:51,846 --> 00:09:02,288
Now, I was born in Romania, and it had a pretty rough time up until like 30 years ago, and it wasn't exactly known for its rich and outstanding characters and stories.

88
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:11,391
But I was born right on time for Western pop culture to kick in and fill my tiny child brain, which was starving for an escape at the time.

89
00:09:11,891 --> 00:09:16,972
So for me, shows like The Simpsons were peak comedy and almost a religious experience.

90
00:09:17,973 --> 00:09:27,442
Homer Simpson, as you know, as you maybe know, is a naive and lovable but a little dumb kind of character So I'd like to introduce you all to Hank

91
00:09:29,312 --> 00:09:31,053
Hank is the main character in Burn Breakfast.

92
00:09:31,453 --> 00:09:32,873
Now I'm going to talk a lot about Hank.

93
00:09:33,534 --> 00:09:38,396
And quite frankly, because I want to drive home a point that is very important to me.

94
00:09:38,816 --> 00:09:45,878
And I think that it's important in developing any story-based thing, but especially video games, which is build your character.

95
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:48,099
And I mean really build your character.

96
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:48,640
Define them.

97
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,180
Develop them.

98
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:49,880
Give them lives.

99
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,081
Give them quirks and features.

100
00:09:51,441 --> 00:09:52,301
Just make them funny.

101
00:09:52,361 --> 00:09:52,941
Make them sad.

102
00:09:53,001 --> 00:09:54,822
Whatever you do, don't make them boring.

103
00:09:55,222 --> 00:09:55,902
Make them interesting.

104
00:09:56,363 --> 00:09:56,843
Super easy.

105
00:09:58,323 --> 00:10:15,352
When we developed our pitch, we had a pretty good idea of what Hank needed to be, and we knew we'd need to spend some serious time polishing him up, both for his art direction, his animation, his personality, and I think it was one of the best decisions we could make to build him up as much as possible.

106
00:10:15,732 --> 00:10:19,975
It took about 12 months out of our process to just get the final Hank.

107
00:10:21,716 --> 00:10:24,678
We kept pushing his design forward, kept iterating.

108
00:10:25,038 --> 00:10:32,684
We needed him to feel right because the game centered around this character who the player had to actually perceive and not just project themselves onto.

109
00:10:33,584 --> 00:10:38,528
So one of the core parts of Hank is his adorable walk cycle, which this was not it.

110
00:10:39,749 --> 00:10:40,729
We kept iterating.

111
00:10:40,749 --> 00:10:42,711
We invested a lot of time and effort in.

112
00:10:43,011 --> 00:10:44,352
There were many walk cycles.

113
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:48,055
Arguably, this was the second best after the one we actually picked.

114
00:10:49,359 --> 00:10:59,154
But we took some really serious time in exploring all the ways a bear could walk until it was funny looking enough, weighty, and made this kind of happy to just walk around in the world with.

115
00:10:59,943 --> 00:11:03,925
And after all of that, we finally landed on Psych.

116
00:11:04,345 --> 00:11:06,706
There were even more walk cycles.

117
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:08,307
It was a lot of walk cycles.

118
00:11:08,607 --> 00:11:11,608
But anyway, we finally landed on something we were actually proud of.

119
00:11:12,269 --> 00:11:19,732
And I really want to emphasize how important this long period of constant iteration turned out to be, because Hank is arguably the most successful part of the game.

120
00:11:20,452 --> 00:11:24,154
And I think a lot of the game's achievements rest on his little shoulders.

121
00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:40,539
Now, the game also has a handful of other varied characters, some of which were created to kind of subtly support a role within the game's mechanics, which I'll talk about a little bit later, beyond this narrative box that they needed to fill.

122
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:51,749
Even if it didn't matter to the gameplay though, characters always needed to serve a purpose, either moving the story forward or supporting the main character.

123
00:11:53,451 --> 00:11:59,856
And like I said, we designed characters that ended up actually informing mechanics rather than the other way around.

124
00:12:00,236 --> 00:12:03,539
For example, this little person right here, his name is Took.

125
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,462
This little dumpster raccoon would obviously be associated with garbage.

126
00:12:08,323 --> 00:12:29,034
And as a side note, you'd think that the name Took comes from a combination of Tom and Nook, and you'd be right, but he also has kind of a duo character that hasn't been revealed yet, but like they're kind of a pair and it's kind of a love letter to Peregrine Took, and there's also the past tense of the verb to take because he's a little thief, and I'm very proud of that.

127
00:12:29,614 --> 00:12:35,558
Anyway, in the game, the player has to deal with the plague that is human beings, specifically tourists.

128
00:12:36,178 --> 00:12:36,478
Worst.

129
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:37,359
I am a tourist.

130
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:47,965
If you haven't played the game, the guests rate their vacation with you through a simple point-based system for things like comfort, hygiene, food, and also decoration.

131
00:12:50,386 --> 00:12:54,267
Humans also, unfortunately, really like to leave garbage everywhere.

132
00:12:55,168 --> 00:12:58,709
It negatively impacts the decoration score and it just makes things ugly.

133
00:12:59,209 --> 00:13:02,990
And as a player, you have to find all the garbage and pick it up.

134
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:10,352
So while developing this, we realized that, hey, our little dumpster diver could serve a very logical, mechanical role in the game.

135
00:13:10,953 --> 00:13:18,535
We could turn the garbage you collect into currency and then exchange it for decorative items in a shop that Tuk would own.

136
00:13:21,818 --> 00:13:41,059
After characters, the second part of our adventure qualifier is the story of the game, which is a very linear one, and that's arguably an odd choice in a game like this, mainly because a linear story doesn't usually mean a lot of replayability, and that kind of is an important part of a management-style game.

137
00:13:43,594 --> 00:13:47,795
You can also make choices in a game, but they're not real, just like real life.

138
00:13:48,615 --> 00:14:00,738
Instead, we use them as kind of a progression gate, or as a way to break the dialogue, to give the player a bit of like a rest in between the more text-heavy conversations, but also as a way to showcase Hank's personality.

139
00:14:01,038 --> 00:14:10,860
So for example, whenever Hank talked to humans, as opposed to talking to other animals, no matter what the player chose in the dialogue option, the result would always be bear noises.

140
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:16,682
and sometimes make them more personable through text formatting.

141
00:14:17,642 --> 00:14:19,683
We also used comic book style cutscenes.

142
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:29,146
This was really important for us to be able to have a lot of flexibility in defining some story moments, which we otherwise couldn't have done with a team of our size.

143
00:14:30,354 --> 00:14:33,496
And there's also some secrets here and there in the game.

144
00:14:34,696 --> 00:14:42,080
There's diverse areas and you wouldn't really find any of the secrets if you didn't look for them, but we felt it was important to add.

145
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:50,584
And speaking of secrets, there are also plenty of secrets in the story of the game, but they're all optional beyond the main part of the story.

146
00:14:51,504 --> 00:15:01,026
And last but not least, the ending of the game is pretty open-ended, which we did from like a desire to tell a deeper story than we could ship originally.

147
00:15:01,086 --> 00:15:05,768
So we left a lot of loose threads that we could hang on to and we're still like kind of developing.

148
00:15:07,008 --> 00:15:11,629
And also let the player be able to continue the management gameplay once they're done with the story.

149
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:32,739
So in my mind, based on what we had in our original pitch deck, we've threaded the needle on story and characters decently well, and even if we don't have puzzles or combat, this wasn't an issue, because we satisfied everything, all the elements we wanted to highlight from this genre, and we were kind of happy with the distillation of having adventure in our game

150
00:15:33,719 --> 00:15:56,665
To summarize the main pillars we had to define the adventure, elements of the game were a very polished main character with a well-defined cast of supporting characters, a strong linear storyline mainly told through secondary characters with some added mystery for spice, and a very varied and interesting world with small secrets to reward exploration.

151
00:15:58,306 --> 00:15:58,506
Cool.

152
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,547
But what about the meat of the game, the rest of the game?

153
00:16:01,767 --> 00:16:02,607
What about management?

154
00:16:03,581 --> 00:16:06,342
Well, management is far easier to categorize in your head.

155
00:16:06,622 --> 00:16:15,003
For me, it brings up things like Roller Coaster Tycoon or City Skylines, but it still kind of bears a lot of weight.

156
00:16:15,644 --> 00:16:27,246
It's arguably more than adventure because management games have historically attracted players who are looking for deeper mechanics, kind of, and they can sometimes be pretty hardcore about it.

157
00:16:28,598 --> 00:16:33,104
Barren Breakfast plays a little bit like a game called Theme Hospital, which is one of my favorites growing up.

158
00:16:34,085 --> 00:16:40,292
And instead of being like an all-controlling figure in the sky, you use Hank to do crafting in some of the buildings, mostly.

159
00:16:41,394 --> 00:16:44,137
And when we were picking the loop for

160
00:16:44,978 --> 00:16:49,280
pitching the game, we had a pretty straightforward one in mind.

161
00:16:49,780 --> 00:17:03,166
And I'm pretty happy with how it turned out eventually, because we have a game where you can scavenge for materials, craft furniture, place it in the hotel rooms that you build, and then accept guests and manage them.

162
00:17:03,586 --> 00:17:08,629
And if you get tired of all that, you can just do a little exploring for more materials and secrets.

163
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:13,511
So in the end, a pretty complex overall tight game loop, right?

164
00:17:14,648 --> 00:17:25,924
I'm so happy we didn't do something really dumb like overscoping and adding a card-based cooking minigame or a clothing and trinket system that further added complexity to the gameplay loop.

165
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:37,353
An unfortunate reality for modern developers, I feel, is that you're kind of playing to the tune of successful and influential games that came before yours.

166
00:17:38,033 --> 00:17:46,457
So for us, that meant that there are a lot of quality of life expectations for modern management games, especially in UI and UX.

167
00:17:46,918 --> 00:17:50,740
And this adds on top of your already really heavy workload.

168
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,561
Terraria has an auto-sort inventory button.

169
00:17:53,921 --> 00:17:54,582
Why doesn't yours?

170
00:17:55,322 --> 00:17:57,523
World of Warcraft has auto-loot on containers.

171
00:17:58,143 --> 00:17:58,643
Where's yours?

172
00:18:00,124 --> 00:18:13,390
So while we kept having to add and add and add things to the game, I felt like we couldn't afford to de-scope because I felt like we'd risk losing the player's interest in the management mechanics.

173
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:27,761
We also sprinkled new mechanics from the start of the game all the way throughout the end in an attempt to kind of keep things fresh so even in the last area as you discover it you still found a new mechanic that you didn't have like 20 hours earlier in the game.

174
00:18:30,202 --> 00:18:41,413
To summarize the core of the management aspect of the game, we kind of prioritized a very tight loop that didn't rush the player to progress and allowed us to introduce new gameplay all throughout the game.

175
00:18:42,034 --> 00:18:52,024
We had a pretty simple resource system that felt familiar enough and felt like it provided a familiar and satisfying crafting experience, and it didn't really become a grind.

176
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:58,850
And managing groups, rooms, and guests was simplified to like a point-based system that was pretty relaxed.

177
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:03,373
But we had just enough room for the min-maxers out there.

178
00:19:06,196 --> 00:19:14,362
So now with the two genres covered, let's talk about how we kind of blend them together with some specific examples.

179
00:19:19,232 --> 00:19:25,501
Like I mentioned before, combining genres is a very deliberate choice to make your life harder.

180
00:19:26,322 --> 00:19:29,747
But when you can get it to work, it can make you feel very smart.

181
00:19:30,348 --> 00:19:34,433
And that's like the kind of small wins that you need to feed on during game development.

182
00:19:35,094 --> 00:19:52,109
For example, we realized that we could automate some of the micromanagement mechanics we introduced very early in the game, and it would go a really long way towards freeing up the player in the endgame and allow them to spend more time doing things that maybe they found to be fun, like exploring, decorating, min-maxing, whatever.

183
00:19:52,769 --> 00:19:59,295
We made four possible automations around accepting guests, around garbage, around food, for example.

184
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:20,509
We realized that instead of going like the generic route that some management games do of hiring staff in the game from a randomly generated pool, we could instead make it more like a more personalized experience with the characters that you kind of grew up with in the game and kind of connected through.

185
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:30,096
For instance, instead of going to every hotel in the whole game and kind of making sure rooms are booked and turning a profit, you could hire Gus, the possum.

186
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:32,698
as a concierge.

187
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:37,502
And he would welcome your guests and be an all-around helpful and kind presence.

188
00:20:38,803 --> 00:20:46,349
Or instead, for instance, if you didn't want to clear the garbage in every single house by yourself, you could hire Wade the rat.

189
00:20:46,669 --> 00:20:55,797
And Wade would just run around and gather all of the currency for you simultaneously, kind of giving you passive income and keeping your cabins clean.

190
00:20:56,337 --> 00:21:01,437
Of course, Wade is a much cuter connoisseur of garbage compared to Took the raccoon.

191
00:21:02,951 --> 00:21:05,152
And all of these services in-game cost money.

192
00:21:05,292 --> 00:21:06,752
Well, in-game money, obviously.

193
00:21:07,213 --> 00:21:19,337
And you couldn't just hire this character from the start, but you could instead progress their quest to a certain point, which allowed us to kind of pace the game intuitively and give the player, like, get them acquainted with these characters.

194
00:21:20,177 --> 00:21:27,199
And the micromanagement tasks first, and then give them a choice to be like, spend some profit and have an easier life in the game.

195
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:32,081
And then they could make this choice.

196
00:21:33,823 --> 00:21:38,645
Our pitch also had an element of progress and difficulty, which translated well in the final game.

197
00:21:38,905 --> 00:21:39,685
This is Pinefall.

198
00:21:39,926 --> 00:21:51,030
Pinefall is the very last area, and it had three full cabins, all the mechanics unlocked, and you basically had the task of making as much money as possible in order to advance the story and finish the game.

199
00:21:52,531 --> 00:21:58,994
We also pitched the story progression through bigger and bigger areas, which also translated well into the game in the end.

200
00:22:00,623 --> 00:22:10,271
In this original slide in the pitch deck, this wasn't about progression, this was about making the game a roguelike management game, which I'm so happy we didn't do.

201
00:22:13,534 --> 00:22:16,597
So in the end, this kind of combination really worked out.

202
00:22:17,497 --> 00:22:20,519
and it was because of the compromises we made and not despite them.

203
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:32,244
We wouldn't have been able to deliver like a fully fledged adventure game, whatever that means, or a very deep management game, but we did end up with a very solid blend and players really seemed to appreciate that.

204
00:22:33,225 --> 00:22:35,346
So that brings me to what actually worked.

205
00:22:35,846 --> 00:22:39,768
The overall success and perks that we got due to blending genres.

206
00:22:40,663 --> 00:22:50,495
Well, it allowed us to kind of synthesize the essentials of each game category and kind of pick our desired elements and let us be focused on each of them.

207
00:22:51,215 --> 00:22:55,040
It helped us play to our strengths, both creatively and throughout production.

208
00:22:56,161 --> 00:22:58,404
Although, as you'll see towards the end, not all the time.

209
00:22:59,104 --> 00:23:05,852
And the things like I mentioned earlier, like hiring established characters as staff in the cabins was a really big strength point.

210
00:23:06,192 --> 00:23:11,458
It gave a deeper sense of purpose to the task itself because it was a character you cared about.

211
00:23:12,672 --> 00:23:20,220
And this could be a talk in itself, but I really want to mention some small marketing beats, specifically on Twitter, that I really love.

212
00:23:21,321 --> 00:23:26,386
Catherine, who's here today, our community manager from our publisher, had a talk on this subject, which was really good.

213
00:23:26,866 --> 00:23:34,694
But basically, using Hank as a voice for our Twitter account was a really solid choice, given how complex of a character he is.

214
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:47,039
There was also a moment when Unity decided to award us like a third place most anticipated game in 2020 after Silksong and League of Legends Wild Rift.

215
00:23:49,219 --> 00:24:01,783
We had to announce a delay in the game at one point and we were really really surprised to see that our community rallied behind us really hard and these last two ones like don't aren't really related to mixing genres but I still love them.

216
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:08,404
But I do think our approach gave some of our bigger partners the confidence to showcase us multiple times.

217
00:24:08,684 --> 00:24:15,570
Like, for instance, Nintendo always helped us by putting our trailers up on their channels, and it helped us immensely throughout.

218
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:17,411
It put a lot of eyes on us.

219
00:24:18,172 --> 00:24:23,316
So in the end, the perks of kind of mixing the genres for us, mixing adventure and management,

220
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:33,627
Our team was kind of better positioned to take on production of elements we picked rather than try to do everything at once from just one genre.

221
00:24:34,654 --> 00:25:01,880
the combination of elements from each genre kind of complemented each other even from the concept stage and it made like our overall vision stronger so it was a great tool to validate and kind of make that vision better and the game was kind of originally born out of a desire for more management games with a more developed narrative and this really gave us a really concrete niche to feel it really helped us find our place in the world

222
00:25:03,607 --> 00:25:09,375
Overall, the positives really shined through for us, but as you all know, it can't always be rosy.

223
00:25:09,896 --> 00:25:11,197
So what about what didn't work?

224
00:25:12,099 --> 00:25:15,864
Or better yet, like I like to call it, what about the mistakes?

225
00:25:17,606 --> 00:25:19,288
Well, for example,

226
00:25:21,371 --> 00:25:23,272
The start of the game is really slow.

227
00:25:23,693 --> 00:25:30,357
Like, there's a bunch of front-loaded story, which I'm still very happy about, because you meet some of my favorite characters at the start of the game.

228
00:25:30,677 --> 00:25:38,343
But it can take players, like, up to 30 minutes before they get to build anything, and that can turn off a lot of people, like, just looking to start building something.

229
00:25:40,448 --> 00:26:07,028
In addition to the slow start we chose to add like optional quests very early in the game and we didn't give a specific explicit pathway to progress in the main storyline and You know and not being very explicit about the optional quests being both optional just this kind of led players to being very confused as a start and getting a lot of support tickets for people saying they were softlocked despite that not being the case this came like from an over

230
00:26:08,146 --> 00:26:12,049
indulgence in trying to mix the narrative with the management.

231
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:16,672
We also tried our best to mention that the game was on the casual side.

232
00:26:16,912 --> 00:26:20,775
Even in the first description text you see about the game on the Steam page for instance.

233
00:26:21,636 --> 00:26:26,139
But I don't know if we could even actually fix this if we wanted to.

234
00:26:26,179 --> 00:26:28,941
Because we had players that were pretty upset that the game

235
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:40,413
didn't offer more, for instance, freedom in time manipulation and didn't allow for a more straightforward management-only experience because that's what you'd expect from games in this genre.

236
00:26:41,315 --> 00:26:46,580
And our desire to keep the story and management progression so intertwined forced us to limit these freedoms.

237
00:26:47,361 --> 00:26:49,203
There's no sandbox mode yet.

238
00:26:51,378 --> 00:27:03,402
But on the other side, we had players that were kind of pissed off that we didn't have enough character interaction, like there's no dating system, there's no gifting or anything like in Stardew Valley, for instance.

239
00:27:03,802 --> 00:27:08,464
So we kind of had complaints coming in from both ends, which we were expecting, but still.

240
00:27:09,932 --> 00:27:18,578
And finally, the big one and kind of by far my biggest regret in the development of this game is the way we handle production sometimes.

241
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:31,928
In our pitch deck, coming from a place of relatively little experience as a team, we pitched a development time of 12 to 14 months from prototype to ship.

242
00:27:32,998 --> 00:27:36,800
which was a wild plan to begin with, but in the end it took us over 30.

243
00:27:37,521 --> 00:27:43,105
And I know that doesn't sound like a long time anyway, but it was like over double what the pitch was.

244
00:27:44,966 --> 00:27:51,430
And with the delays, of course, that meant more budget and our budget kind of exploded, which is a lot.

245
00:27:52,511 --> 00:27:57,134
It was quite a big margin and we were only able to do this because our publisher was cool.

246
00:27:57,554 --> 00:28:00,696
And in the end, we'll always be thankful for that.

247
00:28:01,892 --> 00:28:08,461
Despite all this, it kind of still led to a lot of difficult times during production, which I feel personally a lot of regret for.

248
00:28:08,582 --> 00:28:14,310
We had moments that felt pretty hopeless and very anxiety-inducing, like this screenshot from a Zoom call.

249
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:17,695
Midway through development, we were obviously having a great time.

250
00:28:19,358 --> 00:28:25,662
and the personal failing of mine was taking on way more jobs than I could handle at once, which led to certain aspects of the game falling behind.

251
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:28,764
I had to finish writing the game at this point, but I was making these.

252
00:28:30,485 --> 00:28:33,847
These pieces were way less stressful than having to actually write a good story.

253
00:28:35,618 --> 00:28:39,079
Anyway, in the end, I'm happy to report that this wasn't always the case.

254
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:46,682
We were able to stick together, we were able to learn from our mistakes as we went along, and I know that not all teams are able to do that.

255
00:28:47,823 --> 00:28:51,084
But having the game resonate with a lot of people very early on

256
00:28:52,299 --> 00:28:57,042
kept us kind of together and focused on shipping, and combining genres served as a tool for us.

257
00:28:57,802 --> 00:29:04,126
It allowed us to explore more facets of game development, perhaps making the game stand out more and give us more opportunities for marketing.

258
00:29:05,007 --> 00:29:06,968
And we did have happy moments during development as well.

259
00:29:07,768 --> 00:29:12,551
In the end, on July 28th, 2022, we launched the game, still together as a team.

260
00:29:13,092 --> 00:29:14,492
Quick recap to finish up.

261
00:29:15,578 --> 00:29:17,279
Why would you blend genres for an indie game?

262
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:25,645
Well, throwing currently popular genres in a bowl and seeing what blends can be a valid approach for quick prototyping or like it can define your whole game.

263
00:29:26,786 --> 00:29:27,666
It's always a gamble though.

264
00:29:28,187 --> 00:29:33,730
It has to be utilized as a way to come up with an idea rather than a method to strengthen an existing one.

265
00:29:34,451 --> 00:29:35,512
You should have a good vision.

266
00:29:37,213 --> 00:29:40,876
More and more games come out and studios become more and more specialized in their niche.

267
00:29:41,276 --> 00:29:45,520
So kind of trying to mix and match genre elements feel like it's becoming more of a method to stand out.

268
00:29:46,821 --> 00:29:55,228
And it's a great tool for a small team with limited resources, but it should probably just not serve as a replacement for like that strong vision and like sturdy base.

269
00:29:57,009 --> 00:29:57,650
Thank you so much.
