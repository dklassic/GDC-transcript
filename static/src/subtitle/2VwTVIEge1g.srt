00:00:06,709 --> 00:00:12,794
I am a researcher at the Squid Research Lab, where we study the mysterious forms of squid that transform into human form.

2
00:00:13,575 --> 00:00:20,741
Hello, I am a member of Squid Research Lab, an institute that studies a mysterious type of transforming squid.

3
00:00:22,703 --> 00:00:26,106
But I'm afraid speaking like this for a long time might grow tiresome, so I'll just do it like this.

4
00:00:36,613 --> 00:00:37,294
I'm Nogami from Nintendo.

5
00:00:37,314 --> 00:00:40,455
I joined Nintendo in 1994 and have been a member for 24 years.

6
00:00:40,515 --> 00:00:44,657
I started as an artist in the development of SNES's Yoshi Island.

7
00:01:06,759 --> 00:01:11,524
My first work was as an artist during the development of Yoshi's Island for the Super

8
00:01:11,564 --> 00:01:12,806
Nintendo Entertainment System.

9
00:01:25,381 --> 00:01:29,722
After that, I worked for over 10 years on development of the Animal Crossing series

10
00:01:29,902 --> 00:01:31,623
as both a director and an artist.

11
00:01:32,263 --> 00:01:36,904
Now, I work as the producer of both the Splatoon and Animal Crossing franchises.

12
00:01:39,145 --> 00:01:44,766
Today, I'd like to talk about how both Splatoon and Splatoon 2 came to be.

13
00:01:45,986 --> 00:01:50,127
Today, I'd like to talk about how both Splatoon and Splatoon 2 came to be.

14
00:01:51,748 --> 00:01:53,568
We, the Nintendo development team,

15
00:01:54,325 --> 00:01:58,387
what we were thinking about while making these games.

16
00:01:58,968 --> 00:02:02,170
I hope this will be a meaningful time for you.

17
00:02:03,431 --> 00:02:05,812
I want to delve into what we on the development team

18
00:02:05,832 --> 00:02:07,774
were thinking about while making these games.

19
00:02:08,234 --> 00:02:09,995
And I hope you'll get a lot out of this session.

20
00:02:12,337 --> 00:02:12,977
At the beginning of 2013,

21
00:02:13,017 --> 00:02:15,679
we gathered 10 members to create a new game

22
00:02:15,739 --> 00:02:18,721
without being trapped in the framework of existing games.

23
00:02:22,388 --> 00:02:26,191
In early 2013, we formed a team of 10 developers

24
00:02:26,651 --> 00:02:28,713
with the goal of creating a new type of game

25
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:31,616
that wouldn't fit easily into pre-existing categories.

26
00:02:32,396 --> 00:02:34,198
We discussed our ideas together every day,

27
00:02:34,338 --> 00:02:36,339
until after half a year, we found ourselves

28
00:02:36,359 --> 00:02:38,341
with over 70 different design proposals and a number

29
00:02:38,421 --> 00:02:39,522
of software prototypes.

30
00:02:52,152 --> 00:02:55,255
The idea that formed the basis for Splatoon emerged from this process.

31
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,671
Our initial prototype was fairly simplistic.

32
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:20,952
You would move a cube-shaped character around a flat map,

33
00:03:21,413 --> 00:03:22,953
shooting out white or black ink.

34
00:03:23,914 --> 00:03:26,234
We used cubes because they were easy to create,

35
00:03:26,515 --> 00:03:29,076
and eventually ended up calling them blocks of tofu.

36
00:03:30,736 --> 00:03:36,298
At this point, we were able to connect multiple Wii Us

37
00:03:36,358 --> 00:03:38,879
and play Splatoon, where you would play as a team

38
00:03:38,899 --> 00:03:40,960
and decide who won by the area of the ground you painted.

39
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,601
Of course you could also attack your opponent and beat them.

40
00:03:43,834 --> 00:03:48,876
Linking together multiple Wii U consoles allowed us to have team battles in which we'd compete

41
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:54,139
to cover the most area with our own team's ink, and that became the core of Splatoon's

42
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:54,659
gameplay.

43
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:57,721
Of course, you can also attack and defeat your opponents.

44
00:04:01,882 --> 00:04:05,604
And at this stage, we'd also come up with ways to make use of the Wii U GamePad.

45
00:04:11,715 --> 00:04:16,218
Winning meant needing to ink the ground around you, but also that this would reveal your location to your opponents.

46
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:20,601
This put players in a bit of a catch-22, and we soon realized it would be one of the most interesting and game-like aspects of our prototype.

47
00:04:45,563 --> 00:04:53,088
You might have seen it in this video, but the idea of hiding within your own ink as a way of concealing your position also emerged around this time.

48
00:04:53,108 --> 00:05:02,053
We used the feature of the Wii U, the gyro function, to create a skeleton of play while searching for a playable expression and operation.

49
00:05:05,428 --> 00:05:10,450
From there, we explored ways to leverage the Wii U's unique features like motion control

50
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:14,151
to come up with actions and inputs that felt good to perform,

51
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,272
and in so doing, build out the gameplay of our idea.

52
00:05:17,292 --> 00:05:22,434
I think that a finished game is classified as a shooter,

53
00:05:22,494 --> 00:05:24,854
and there are parts that use the word shooter.

54
00:05:24,874 --> 00:05:27,595
But we didn't try to make a shooter from the start.

55
00:05:27,615 --> 00:05:30,796
We used a technique that makes it look like a Nintendo-like action game.

56
00:05:34,318 --> 00:05:37,320
the finished game would likely fall into the shooter category.

57
00:05:37,961 --> 00:05:40,583
And parts of it make use of the language of shooters,

58
00:05:40,723 --> 00:05:44,926
but this isn't to say that we'd set out to create a shooting game from the start.

59
00:05:45,607 --> 00:05:49,590
Rather that the gameplay took this shape as a result of the methods we used

60
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:51,892
to make a Nintendo-style action game.

61
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:56,876
The team's ultimate goal was to create a new game,

62
00:05:56,996 --> 00:06:00,519
but our initial goal was to create a new gaming experience.

63
00:06:01,804 --> 00:06:04,365
While our end goal was to create a new game,

64
00:06:04,905 --> 00:06:07,626
the first target we aimed for was creating a new type

65
00:06:07,706 --> 00:06:08,686
of play experience.

66
00:06:11,327 --> 00:06:14,208
We believe that the appearance of a game is important,

67
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:17,609
but we also believe that it is also important to make it

68
00:06:17,649 --> 00:06:18,850
more appealing to the player.

69
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:23,151
Art does not have to represent the function and purpose of a game.

70
00:06:25,628 --> 00:06:27,689
So the look of a game is certainly important,

71
00:06:28,349 --> 00:06:29,710
but I think of it as something that

72
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,710
makes gameplay more compelling and amplifies its appeal.

73
00:06:33,451 --> 00:06:36,471
A game's aesthetic and art must embody and complement

74
00:06:36,552 --> 00:06:37,992
its functionality and purpose.

75
00:06:40,113 --> 00:06:41,813
There were options to use existing IPs,

76
00:06:41,973 --> 00:06:44,394
but I felt that a new world and new characters

77
00:06:44,434 --> 00:06:46,994
were necessary to embody new gameplay.

78
00:06:51,282 --> 00:06:54,084
We did consider the option of using existing IP,

79
00:06:54,644 --> 00:06:57,026
but felt that new characters and a new world

80
00:06:57,146 --> 00:07:00,149
would be the best embodiment of this new play experience.

81
00:07:02,991 --> 00:07:05,353
By the way, Nintendo always has a tendency to create new things.

82
00:07:05,393 --> 00:07:07,234
That's why ARMS and Nintendo Labo were born.

83
00:07:12,797 --> 00:07:17,878
I should mention that there's a sort of ever-present desire at Nintendo to produce new things.

84
00:07:18,659 --> 00:07:23,920
Projects such as ARMS and Nintendo Labo are examples of things born out of this atmosphere.

85
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:28,741
We don't abandon this desire to try new things even when working on established franchises,

86
00:07:28,761 --> 00:07:30,461
for example, with The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild.

87
00:07:41,065 --> 00:07:43,667
And on that note, I hope you'll look forward to my colleague, Mr. Yabuki's arms session,

88
00:07:43,687 --> 00:07:44,347
which is at 2 p.m. today.

89
00:07:44,387 --> 00:07:45,128
But let me backtrack a bit.

90
00:07:45,148 --> 00:07:47,410
The characters of Splatoon are squids that can transform to become humanoids.

91
00:08:09,915 --> 00:08:13,197
At first, we were surprised that the main character was a squid,

92
00:08:13,277 --> 00:08:16,620
but there was a reason for the creation of this character,

93
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,701
and until it was born, there were many theories.

94
00:08:19,662 --> 00:08:24,305
People are often surprised when they first hear that the main character for our game is a squid,

95
00:08:24,825 --> 00:08:27,127
but there are reasons why things ended up this way,

96
00:08:27,447 --> 00:08:31,630
and the road leading to the character's final design was not without its twists and turns.

97
00:08:38,638 --> 00:08:49,364
As development progressed from prototyping to creating an actual product, the characters we first relied on were rabbits.

98
00:08:51,585 --> 00:08:57,968
Rabbits have different colors, such as black and white, which are suitable for the Chinese character.

99
00:08:57,988 --> 00:09:00,109
It is also said that rabbits have a strong sense of balance.

100
00:09:01,239 --> 00:09:05,301
Rabbits can be both black and white, making them easy to separate into teams.

101
00:09:05,861 --> 00:09:09,442
We also learned that rabbits are apparently very territorial creatures.

102
00:09:11,243 --> 00:09:17,346
We wanted to use brightly colored inks and thought they would contrast well with the neutral color of the rabbits.

103
00:09:18,706 --> 00:09:24,428
We wanted to use brightly colored inks and thought they would contrast well with the neutral color of the rabbits.

104
00:09:26,109 --> 00:09:29,871
We were able to explain some of the reasons why we chose rabbits as characters.

105
00:09:31,392 --> 00:09:35,717
These were all reasons we could use to explain why we'd gone with rabbits as characters.

106
00:09:50,038 --> 00:09:52,080
But what would rabbits be doing shooting ink?

107
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,102
Why would rabbits be able to submerge themselves in the ink once they shot it?

108
00:09:56,923 --> 00:10:01,245
These were the sorts of questions that came up when I showed our game to others in the company.

109
00:10:02,566 --> 00:10:04,607
I think it was a lack of persuasion.

110
00:10:05,728 --> 00:10:07,829
Something about the concept still didn't sit right.

111
00:10:07,849 --> 00:10:12,692
I felt that this was not just a mistake in the way the characters were chosen,

112
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:16,955
but that there was a part of the game's idea that was not sufficiently integrated.

113
00:10:18,749 --> 00:10:21,050
So I thought that the game's appearance and gameplay didn't match.

114
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:22,090
To solve this problem, Sakaguchi, the director,

115
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:22,990
organized the player's performance.

116
00:10:45,082 --> 00:10:49,424
To help tackle this problem, one of Splatoon's directors, Mr. Sakaguchi,

117
00:10:50,245 --> 00:10:53,106
organized and consolidated what the player's abilities would be.

118
00:10:53,126 --> 00:10:56,388
When not submerged in ink, you would be able to attack.

119
00:10:56,408 --> 00:10:59,650
While submerged in ink, you would lose that ability to attack,

120
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,611
but would recover health and could move more quickly.

121
00:11:18,181 --> 00:11:22,264
We distributed player abilities across two different forms that the player could take,

122
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:24,385
each with their own pros and cons.

123
00:11:35,605 --> 00:11:38,087
We had all sorts of different character design ideas.

124
00:11:38,888 --> 00:11:41,330
And squids were actually one of the original candidates,

125
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,592
but we couldn't find a definitive reason

126
00:11:43,652 --> 00:11:45,374
to choose one design over another.

127
00:11:45,394 --> 00:11:50,958
But once we thought of this ability to move quickly

128
00:11:51,318 --> 00:11:53,841
through ink as swimming, we discovered a strong reason

129
00:11:53,861 --> 00:11:55,302
to go with squids as our characters.

130
00:12:15,225 --> 00:12:20,189
And to further distinguish between these two ability states, we decided to have the character

131
00:12:20,269 --> 00:12:22,992
take on a more humanoid appearance when not submerged in ink.

132
00:12:23,072 --> 00:12:27,596
And so our characters were born, squids that can transform into people.

133
00:12:34,873 --> 00:12:36,275
This also solidified another pillar of Splatoon's gameplay,

134
00:12:36,315 --> 00:12:38,316
that battles would unfold with characters switching back and forth between these two forms.

135
00:12:38,336 --> 00:12:40,378
We discovered that the act of solving problems in this way gave birth to new gameplay ideas.

136
00:12:41,338 --> 00:12:44,621
This also solidified another pillar of Splatoon's gameplay,

137
00:12:45,061 --> 00:12:49,625
that battles would unfold with characters switching back and forth between these two forms.

138
00:13:02,807 --> 00:13:06,209
This is the trailer we used to show off Splatoon for the first time at E3 in 2014.

139
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:29,301
While it's a short 80-second video put together by Splatoon's other director, Mr. Amano,

140
00:13:29,921 --> 00:13:35,162
the key elements of the game are all on display, from gameplay to sound to art style.

141
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:38,083
Based on what I've discussed up to this point,

142
00:13:38,103 --> 00:13:41,564
it might look as if everything about this world had been planned out from the beginning.

143
00:13:50,709 --> 00:13:52,990
The main character is a squid.

144
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:56,272
The setting is a little bit different from reality.

145
00:13:56,552 --> 00:13:59,634
So far, we've decided on a limited number of members,

146
00:13:59,674 --> 00:14:01,194
such as art directors and directors.

147
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:03,656
So the characters here are squids,

148
00:14:04,236 --> 00:14:06,978
and it takes place in a modern world similar to our own,

149
00:14:07,178 --> 00:14:09,299
though with some slight strange differences.

150
00:14:10,059 --> 00:14:12,041
We'd gotten this far with the game's director,

151
00:14:12,261 --> 00:14:14,682
an art director, and a small-scale development team.

152
00:14:28,773 --> 00:14:33,776
But at this point, individual members of the team began contributing ideas about what they

153
00:14:33,816 --> 00:14:37,618
thought would fit the world well, and other features they felt passionate about.

154
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:41,820
As more assets were created, the world of Splatoon began to take shape.

155
00:14:42,873 --> 00:14:45,875
The design of the weapons, the fashion of the squid, and the graffiti in the city were all similar.

156
00:14:45,915 --> 00:14:48,956
Sound staff suggested that the BGM should be played during the battle,

157
00:14:49,016 --> 00:14:51,417
which is a popular thing among the young people of this world.

158
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:14,733
We also thought of a fictional band, and changed the musicality of each band as we composed.

159
00:15:36,165 --> 00:15:41,687
I created content while imagining that it had nothing to do with the content of the game,

160
00:15:41,787 --> 00:15:43,528
and I made it convincing to the world.

161
00:15:44,448 --> 00:15:47,769
In this way, we propped up our world and made it more convincing

162
00:15:48,089 --> 00:15:52,931
by imagining and creating content not directly linked to the game's core concepts.

163
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:58,793
For example, I made a big bowl that was firmly attached to the beginning,

164
00:15:58,953 --> 00:16:02,635
and then I made the content inflate so that everyone could throw the ball in.

165
00:16:02,655 --> 00:16:05,136
That was the way I made it.

166
00:16:06,638 --> 00:16:11,382
So to give an analogy, it would be as if we started first by building a big container.

167
00:16:12,163 --> 00:16:17,427
Then we tossed balls into this container, filling it up and expanding what the game's content would be.

168
00:16:19,029 --> 00:16:20,971
You might think this process was unique to Splatoon,

169
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:25,414
but it's actually a methodology for creation that Nintendo has long relied on.

170
00:16:36,425 --> 00:16:40,687
There were several issues when we sent Splatoon to the world as a product.

171
00:16:40,727 --> 00:16:47,230
It was an unprecedented IP, so we didn't know how many people would download the game and play it.

172
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:53,412
We had to face a number of challenges in making Splatoon a product we could send out into the world.

173
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:57,294
As this would be a new IP with no established history,

174
00:16:57,834 --> 00:17:00,235
we weren't sure how many people would pick up the game and play it.

175
00:17:02,237 --> 00:17:07,681
As you're likely aware, creating and maintaining a player base is one problem that online multiplayer

176
00:17:08,101 --> 00:17:09,742
games have to wrestle with.

177
00:17:09,782 --> 00:17:13,605
If the population of players is too low, finding people to play against can take time.

178
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:33,872
If the problem gets bad enough, you won't be able to find opponents and the game becomes unplayable.

179
00:17:52,785 --> 00:17:57,366
Also, because Splatoon featured this new mechanic of shooting ink onto the ground,

180
00:17:57,966 --> 00:18:01,387
we felt that releasing all the weapons and stages we'd planned at once

181
00:18:01,867 --> 00:18:06,649
would prevent players from discovering all their unique traits before moving on and forgetting them.

182
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:14,051
We also thought that balance adjustment was essential to allow players to play online games for a long time.

183
00:18:15,729 --> 00:18:17,691
We also felt that balance adjustments

184
00:18:17,831 --> 00:18:19,954
were key to keeping players engaged

185
00:18:20,054 --> 00:18:22,337
with a competitive online multiplayer

186
00:18:22,377 --> 00:18:23,458
game over the long term.

187
00:18:25,901 --> 00:18:30,006
We decided to narrow down the number of game modes and content

188
00:18:30,046 --> 00:18:32,849
to address these issues, and gradually increase

189
00:18:32,869 --> 00:18:35,372
the number of content over the long term.

190
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:42,668
In order to address these issues, we decided to provide a focused amount of game modes and content at launch,

191
00:18:43,308 --> 00:18:46,849
increasing the amount of content a bit at a time over a longer period.

192
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:55,273
We wanted to create an environment where players can continue to play with a fresh mind,

193
00:18:55,293 --> 00:19:01,515
by adding weapons, stages, and rules to the game to help them get used to the game and to grow in the community.

194
00:19:02,911 --> 00:19:08,135
By adding new weapons, stages, and modes as player familiarity with the game increased

195
00:19:08,235 --> 00:19:13,338
and the game's community evolved, we hoped to keep the game fresh for players and create

196
00:19:13,378 --> 00:19:16,140
an environment they'd want to stay engaged with for longer.

197
00:19:29,236 --> 00:19:33,279
This is a graph showing Splatoon and Splatoon 2's daily active users

198
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,082
in the months following the release of each game.

199
00:19:36,702 --> 00:19:38,404
The data is from players around the world.

200
00:19:39,505 --> 00:19:43,128
The games were released two years apart but are shown together on this graph.

201
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:47,272
The blue line is Splatoon while the green line represents Splatoon 2.

202
00:19:59,393 --> 00:20:05,356
Splatoon was released on May 28, 2015, while Splatoon 2 launched on July 21, 2017, so the

203
00:20:05,376 --> 00:20:06,617
start of the graphs are a bit staggered.

204
00:20:27,722 --> 00:20:30,304
The graph is growing every weekend.

205
00:20:30,364 --> 00:20:33,486
There are many users who play on the weekend.

206
00:20:34,606 --> 00:20:40,990
I think you can see pretty clearly that the daily active users for numbers for Splatoon 2 outpace those of Splatoon.

207
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:44,252
The repeating spikes in each graph represent weekends.

208
00:20:44,832 --> 00:20:48,494
And this confirmed our suspicion that a lot of people play Splatoon at the end of the week.

209
00:20:50,626 --> 00:20:56,347
Splatoon maintained a fairly stable rate of daily active users, with a bit of a jump coming in August of 2015.

210
00:20:56,447 --> 00:21:01,108
This was around the time that we released a sizable update for the game, which included a new game mode.

211
00:21:16,281 --> 00:21:20,383
And because the sales of the game increased during Christmas, the sales of the game increased as well.

212
00:21:20,423 --> 00:21:27,527
I think that the increase in sales during Christmas is because we were able to maintain the user's activity and the environment where it was easy to play.

213
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:50,141
Unlike Splatoon, which had no franchise history to rely on, Splatoon 2 saw a sizable increase

214
00:21:50,161 --> 00:21:53,142
in daily user rates immediately following release.

215
00:22:08,265 --> 00:22:11,127
User rates remained particularly high on weekdays,

216
00:22:11,607 --> 00:22:14,410
which we can at least partially credit to an overlap

217
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:16,051
with summer vacation in Japan.

218
00:22:16,071 --> 00:22:20,554
From the second half of August onward,

219
00:22:20,634 --> 00:22:25,658
our weekend daily active user rate was almost horizontal.

220
00:22:37,004 --> 00:22:39,406
Then we saw another large jump during the holidays

221
00:22:39,746 --> 00:22:41,968
and are now maintaining a user rate higher

222
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:43,109
than when the game launched.

223
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:47,132
YOSHIMASA ENJI, JR.:

224
00:22:47,172 --> 00:22:48,533
YOSHIMASA ENJI, JR.:

225
00:22:49,073 --> 00:22:51,796
Right here, you can see our daily user numbers

226
00:22:51,856 --> 00:22:52,836
took a bit of a dip.

227
00:22:54,357 --> 00:22:55,839
YOSHIMASA ENJI, JR.:

228
00:22:55,859 --> 00:22:57,180
YOSHIMASA ENJI, JR.:

229
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,864
And this is actually the weekend when Super Mario Odyssey

230
00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:03,485
was released.

231
00:23:04,828 --> 00:23:08,651
It seems like everyone was busy playing Super Mario Odyssey when it came out, but after

232
00:23:08,771 --> 00:23:12,935
that we released a fairly large update and our numbers recovered.

233
00:23:26,511 --> 00:23:29,513
And there are some big changes in the weekend.

234
00:23:29,534 --> 00:23:35,118
This is the weekend when the game's event is held, called FES.

235
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:40,342
You can also occasionally see spikes larger than the typical weekend increase.

236
00:23:40,983 --> 00:23:45,386
These represent weekends when in-game events called Splatfests took place.

237
00:23:47,248 --> 00:23:49,230
Which do you like better, ketchup or mayonnaise?

238
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:51,451
Halloween costume, vampire or wolf?

239
00:23:53,913 --> 00:23:56,335
and other questions that are not relevant to our daily lives.

240
00:23:56,455 --> 00:23:59,597
We will split the players according to the results of the vote.

241
00:23:59,617 --> 00:24:05,441
And we will collect the results of all the matches that we played for 24 hours

242
00:24:05,461 --> 00:24:06,722
and decide the winner.

243
00:24:06,742 --> 00:24:10,044
This is an event involving all the Splatoon players.

244
00:24:11,185 --> 00:24:14,347
Splatfests bring together the entire Splatoon community

245
00:24:14,567 --> 00:24:19,010
and split them into teams based on their answers to some not-so-serious questions.

246
00:24:19,831 --> 00:24:21,912
Which is the better condiment, ketchup or mayonnaise?

247
00:24:22,837 --> 00:24:26,179
Who would you rather be for Halloween, a vampire or a werewolf?

248
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:32,345
Players then battle furiously for 24 hours, and a winner is determined based on the voting

249
00:24:32,365 --> 00:24:34,667
breakdown and number of wins for each side.

250
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:50,457
I want to encourage people to play games, but I also want to encourage people who don't play to talk about it outside of the game.

251
00:24:53,998 --> 00:24:58,640
When a Splatfest is going on, the entire game is wrapped up in a festive atmosphere,

252
00:24:59,161 --> 00:25:02,722
and players fill the hub area with handwritten messages and drawings.

253
00:25:03,643 --> 00:25:07,444
Splatfests are of course designed to give people a reason to play the game,

254
00:25:07,924 --> 00:25:12,186
but we also hope they get those not actually playing involved in the conversation,

255
00:25:12,706 --> 00:25:17,268
and in so doing make Splatoon something that's discussed beyond the bounds of the game itself.

256
00:25:18,625 --> 00:25:25,648
I want you to seriously discuss which is more important, your family, friends, social media, ketchup or mayonnaise.

257
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:37,633
It's our hope that family members, friends and people using social media use these events to get in seriously silly debates about pressing topics like whether ketchup is a better condiment than mayonnaise.

258
00:25:41,854 --> 00:25:44,895
The development of Splatoon 2 started during the previous update.

259
00:25:47,557 --> 00:25:52,261
Development of Splatoon 2 began while we were still in the middle of updating the first game.

260
00:25:53,783 --> 00:25:58,147
This was prior to the announcement of the Nintendo Switch,

261
00:25:58,187 --> 00:26:02,271
but when I first heard about the concept for the new hardware, I thought it sounded like a good fit for Splatoon.

262
00:26:13,855 --> 00:26:19,459
At home, we can use the TV to watch TV, and we can take the Nintendo Switch outside and use it to communicate with friends.

263
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:25,223
We can freely use these two play styles, and I felt that it was a new experience for Splatoon's multiplayer.

264
00:26:29,052 --> 00:26:31,934
The ability to change freely between two styles of play,

265
00:26:32,374 --> 00:26:34,836
so playing online on a TV while at home,

266
00:26:35,416 --> 00:26:37,297
and then taking the Nintendo Switch on the go

267
00:26:37,337 --> 00:26:39,399
to play via local wireless with friends,

268
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:42,100
fits Splatoon's multiplayer model well,

269
00:26:42,281 --> 00:26:44,142
but also felt like a new experience.

270
00:26:46,363 --> 00:26:48,845
On the other hand, there were several challenges

271
00:26:49,085 --> 00:26:51,326
in creating Splatoon on a new platform.

272
00:26:51,346 --> 00:26:51,626
One was...

273
00:26:54,324 --> 00:26:55,585
the screen composition would change,

274
00:26:55,645 --> 00:26:59,188
but we were able to overcome this by trial and error.

275
00:27:00,449 --> 00:27:03,271
On the other hand, we had to face numerous challenges

276
00:27:03,391 --> 00:27:05,493
in creating Splatoon for a new platform.

277
00:27:06,394 --> 00:27:09,297
One of these was that the layout of the screen had changed,

278
00:27:09,557 --> 00:27:13,160
but we were able to overcome this by trying a variety of solutions.

279
00:27:14,861 --> 00:27:16,663
One of the big challenges was that

280
00:27:16,683 --> 00:27:18,925
the player population would decrease

281
00:27:19,005 --> 00:27:20,226
by the time the game was released.

282
00:27:22,235 --> 00:27:25,358
At the time, we didn't know how much the Nintendo Switch would sell.

283
00:27:26,459 --> 00:27:30,943
Another hurdle was knowing that until the Nintendo Switch became more established,

284
00:27:31,303 --> 00:27:33,245
it was possible that our player base would shrink.

285
00:27:34,146 --> 00:27:37,229
At the time, we had no idea how much the Nintendo Switch would sell.

286
00:27:37,249 --> 00:27:44,195
We also wanted new players to have the same experience as those who had played the previous game.

287
00:27:47,524 --> 00:27:50,807
We also wanted new players with no experience of the first game

288
00:27:51,327 --> 00:27:53,669
and veteran players from the original Splatoon

289
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:56,232
to have the same sort of experience with Splatoon 2.

290
00:27:56,272 --> 00:28:01,096
To accomplish this, we continued our strategy from the first game,

291
00:28:01,176 --> 00:28:02,097
adding content in real time

292
00:28:02,137 --> 00:28:04,419
to match the growth of player skill and the community itself.

293
00:28:15,357 --> 00:28:19,758
and the experience of enjoying the process of content growth

294
00:28:19,778 --> 00:28:21,198
is the value of Splatoon.

295
00:28:22,099 --> 00:28:25,179
Our reasoning for this was that Splatoon's value as a game

296
00:28:25,659 --> 00:28:29,280
came at least in part from the experience of enjoying and adapting

297
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,800
to a constantly evolving set of content.

298
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:35,881
The single player hero mode

299
00:28:35,901 --> 00:28:39,902
was a practice game where players who were not confident in jumping into a battle

300
00:28:39,922 --> 00:28:43,083
would get used to the controls and then try out the other modes.

301
00:28:45,503 --> 00:28:50,707
The single player campaign, which we call Hero Mode, serves as a sort of training ground

302
00:28:50,747 --> 00:28:55,570
for new players who might lack confidence with the controls before taking on other modes. 遊び進めていけば十分な手応えがありますし、世界を掘り下げ、キャラクターに愛着を持ってもらう役割もあります。

303
00:28:57,932 --> 00:29:04,376
Playing through the campaign puts players through their paces, but also lets them delve into the world and builds their affection for the characters.

304
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:27,540
And as we anticipated Splatoon 2 would have many new players, we decided to give this mode the same purpose this time around.

305
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:34,284
We also wanted to create a new game that would be another highlight of Splatoon 2.

306
00:29:34,324 --> 00:29:35,985
We chose Salmon Run as our theme.

307
00:29:38,882 --> 00:29:44,147
But we also wanted to offer a new type of play that would be a big attraction for Splatoon 2.

308
00:29:44,827 --> 00:29:48,871
This wound up being Salmon Run, a mode that focuses on cooperation.

309
00:30:02,318 --> 00:30:08,204
Though relatively simple in structure, this mode challenges player proficiency with the game's core controls,

310
00:30:08,825 --> 00:30:13,989
requires them to use a variety of weapons, and was designed to encourage replayability.

311
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:21,176
The three modes, War, Hero, and Salmon Run, are independent games,

312
00:30:21,216 --> 00:30:23,939
but are designed to be connected as one game cycle.

313
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:33,394
While the three modes of multiplayer, single player, and salmon run each offer unique play experiences,

314
00:30:33,654 --> 00:30:36,416
they were designed as pieces of a single game cycle.

315
00:30:36,436 --> 00:30:40,618
Rewards earned during single player and salmon run can be used in multiplayer,

316
00:30:40,678 --> 00:30:43,599
and the skills acquired in each mode will come in handy in each of the others.

317
00:31:04,406 --> 00:31:09,749
年を越える若者が縄張りバトルに強じる傾き アルバイトに汗をかく そして人知れずヒーローとして世界を救う So the young squid who is the player's character, has come to the city to take part in turf war battles,

318
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:12,031
but also works a part-time job.

319
00:31:12,771 --> 00:31:17,414
And unbeknownst to anyone, they're also the unsung hero tasked with saving the world. プレイヤーの体験としても、分身である一人のイカの若者を中心とした出来事に見えるように演出しています。

320
00:31:25,782 --> 00:31:29,145
These experiences the player has are designed to make it feel

321
00:31:29,485 --> 00:31:32,848
like the game world revolves around them and their inkling character.

322
00:31:35,611 --> 00:31:39,954
Splatoon is not a game where you just play through all the content you have prepared for release.

323
00:31:39,994 --> 00:31:43,878
It's a dynamic experience where you can grow and evolve through the content.

324
00:31:43,938 --> 00:31:45,839
I think this is also a game's value.

325
00:31:47,723 --> 00:31:52,265
Splatoon was envisioned not as a game that you simply play to completion after purchasing,

326
00:31:52,765 --> 00:31:59,469
but as a dynamic experience with value that comes from its content's ability to grow and change over time.

327
00:31:59,489 --> 00:32:03,831
We saw ourselves providing Splatoon as a set of experiences for the players,

328
00:32:03,911 --> 00:32:05,792
as opposed to a static piece of software.

329
00:32:18,334 --> 00:32:24,716
While the first game and Splatoon 2 split this single experience into two different

330
00:32:24,736 --> 00:32:28,657
products, we hoped people would come to think of the two games as constituent parts of a

331
00:32:28,677 --> 00:32:30,718
connected whole.

332
00:32:43,374 --> 00:32:45,797
The world of Splatoon 2 is a world that has been around for two years,

333
00:32:45,817 --> 00:32:47,400
the same time as the previous game.

334
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,842
We decided on the setting first,

335
00:32:48,862 --> 00:32:52,528
and then we built up the city, the fashion, the music, etc.

336
00:32:52,568 --> 00:32:55,152
so that you could feel the two years of transition.

337
00:32:59,523 --> 00:33:03,485
Two years passed in our world between the releases of the two games,

338
00:33:04,106 --> 00:33:07,108
and that same time has passed within the world of the game itself.

339
00:33:07,868 --> 00:33:13,492
Having decided that from the beginning, we designed the look of Splatoon 2's Inkopolis Square,

340
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:17,534
as well as the fashion and music trends of our squid characters,

341
00:33:17,995 --> 00:33:20,716
to reflect the changing trends over these two years.

342
00:33:20,736 --> 00:33:27,601
This flow is also connected to the Octo Expansion, which was announced the other day.

343
00:33:29,559 --> 00:33:33,780
And the Octo Expansion we announced recently is another example of this perspective.

344
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:39,861
In the Octo Expansion, we explore aspects of the world and characters we hadn't been able to completely flesh out in the main game.

345
00:33:40,661 --> 00:33:47,542
In the Octo Expansion, we explore aspects of the world and characters we hadn't been able to completely flesh out in the main game.

346
00:33:47,562 --> 00:33:51,923
And by merging the Octo with the new species, the Octo,

347
00:33:52,023 --> 00:33:55,844
Splatoon 2 will be transformed into the next time.

348
00:33:57,674 --> 00:34:02,598
With this expansion, a new type of character, the Octolings, will join Inkling society,

349
00:34:03,138 --> 00:34:07,621
adding further to the changes that Splatoon 2's world experiences over time.

350
00:34:20,712 --> 00:34:30,117
With the Octo Expansion, we wanted to explore ideas for using the variety of weapons and player abilities we'd created to enable players to get the most out of Splatoon 2.

351
00:34:49,341 --> 00:34:56,927
And while this content is paid DLC, we designed it for the player who wants to explore the world of Splatoon 2 on an even deeper level.

352
00:34:57,808 --> 00:35:02,511
Of course, we plan to continue offering free updates to the game's weapons, stages, and more,

353
00:35:02,952 --> 00:35:07,315
to ensure that all players can participate in multiplayer on an even playing field.

354
00:35:16,473 --> 00:35:19,053
We've also changed and re-created some of the characters to fit the fans' reactions.

355
00:35:19,073 --> 00:35:21,374
These young ladies are the Squid Sisters.

356
00:35:45,677 --> 00:35:49,140
characters that served as guides for the player in the first Splatoon.

357
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,602
In the world of the game, they are a successful pop duo,

358
00:35:51,642 --> 00:35:54,444
but fans have latched onto them even more than we imagined that they would.

359
00:36:13,008 --> 00:36:15,670
Fans have created all sorts of Squid Sister fan art,

360
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:18,932
with some people even imagining elaborate backstories for them.

361
00:36:18,952 --> 00:36:24,695
In response to these requests, we released new songs and held live concerts in the real world.

362
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:27,137
This is a virtual live concert we held in Japan the other day.

363
00:36:43,272 --> 00:36:47,353
This is a scene from the virtual concert we held in Japan just last month.

364
00:36:48,574 --> 00:36:53,316
At this event, the Squid Sisters partnered with the new guide characters from Splatoon 2, Off the Hook.

365
00:36:53,716 --> 00:36:55,977
About 5,000 people came out to this show and really raised the roof.

366
00:37:22,191 --> 00:37:25,972
It might seem a bit strange to you, but as developers, nothing could make us happier

367
00:37:26,032 --> 00:37:28,993
than to see the characters we've created mean this much to people.

368
00:37:29,673 --> 00:37:34,654
For us, it was like watching kids we'd raised grow up and then go on to succeed in the world

369
00:37:34,714 --> 00:37:35,094
on their own.

370
00:37:36,583 --> 00:37:38,805
We are also monitoring the live content and the game content in detail.

371
00:37:38,825 --> 00:37:42,607
By the way, this live was held in Japan and France, and next week it will be held at the Polymanga 2018 in Switzerland.

372
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:47,331
It has not yet been realized in the United States, so we are looking forward to a good offer from them.

373
00:38:07,022 --> 00:38:10,085
So far, concerts like this have been held in Japan and France,

374
00:38:10,685 --> 00:38:16,310
and next week, we'll have another one at an event called Polymanga 2018 in Switzerland.

375
00:38:17,151 --> 00:38:19,313
There hasn't been a concert yet in the States,

376
00:38:19,453 --> 00:38:23,156
but I can assure you the Squid Sisters are hoping an appealing offer comes along.

377
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:39,964
For the final Splatfest of the first Splatoon, we pitted the squid sisters against one another,

378
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:43,286
and the results carried over into the story for Splatoon 2.

379
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:57,871
We wanted fans to realize both of these things,

380
00:38:58,412 --> 00:39:00,193
that time passing in the real world

381
00:39:00,293 --> 00:39:02,134
passed in the world of Splatoon as well,

382
00:39:02,955 --> 00:39:05,296
and that we absorbed feedback from players

383
00:39:05,436 --> 00:39:06,577
and reflected it in the game.

384
00:39:06,597 --> 00:39:11,501
In the Octo Expansion, we'll also be fleshing out

385
00:39:11,541 --> 00:39:13,982
these characters from off the hook,

386
00:39:14,803 --> 00:39:17,365
In the Octo Expansion, we'll also be fleshing out

387
00:39:17,425 --> 00:39:19,006
these characters from off the hook,

388
00:39:19,646 --> 00:39:21,748
in part as a response to expectations

389
00:39:21,808 --> 00:39:22,888
that we've seen from fans.

390
00:39:25,412 --> 00:39:31,637
I think of events taking place in association with the game in the real world as a part of the game in their own right.

391
00:39:32,899 --> 00:39:39,565
I think of events taking place in association with the game in the real world as a part of the game in their own right.

392
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:42,988
When I was a kid, I enjoyed playing games,

393
00:39:43,008 --> 00:39:46,051
but I also remember having fun talking about games with my friends.

394
00:39:50,844 --> 00:39:54,366
Of course, I'm someone who enjoyed playing games myself as a kid,

395
00:39:54,987 --> 00:39:59,931
but some of my best memories are the excited discussions that I had with my friends about games.

396
00:39:59,951 --> 00:40:03,954
I think drawing fan art and attending events

397
00:40:04,274 --> 00:40:07,197
are still part of enjoying the world of games.

398
00:40:08,097 --> 00:40:11,921
So in my mind, drawing fan art and going to game-related events

399
00:40:12,461 --> 00:40:15,463
are part and parcel with enjoying the world of the game itself.

400
00:40:15,483 --> 00:40:18,926
That's one of the reasons I enjoy games.

401
00:40:19,757 --> 00:40:22,717
This is a video of the Splatoon Koshien tournament in Japan.

402
00:40:22,757 --> 00:40:26,438
More than 870 teams and more than 3,500 people participated in the preliminary round,

403
00:40:26,478 --> 00:40:29,559
which took place in nine venues all over Japan and online.

404
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:30,680
It was a very large-scale tournament.

405
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:48,140
The preliminary rounds were held at nine locations across Japan, as well as online,

406
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:53,702
involving more than 870 teams made up of over 3,500 people,

407
00:40:54,362 --> 00:40:56,403
making for a truly large-scale competition.

408
00:40:56,423 --> 00:41:00,604
While there were many core gamers among the participants,

409
00:41:00,644 --> 00:41:03,945
we also saw lots of teams made up entirely of children or the members of a family.

410
00:41:14,747 --> 00:41:19,771
We saw a team made up of four moms, and a team with members from three generations, including

411
00:41:19,951 --> 00:41:21,993
a grandmother, her daughter, and her granddaughter.

412
00:41:44,774 --> 00:41:49,438
I was really happy to see people from such a broad range of ages and social backgrounds

413
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:52,401
form teams and bring their A-game to play in the tournament.

414
00:41:54,503 --> 00:41:57,366
In the U.S., Splatoon was used in the Nintendo World Championship.

415
00:41:57,426 --> 00:42:04,432
And last year's E3 was a world tournament with representatives from the U.S., Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan.

416
00:42:09,226 --> 00:42:15,029
Splatoon has also appeared as a game in both recent Nintendo World Championships, and at

417
00:42:15,189 --> 00:42:21,692
E3 last year, we held an international championship featuring teams from the US, Europe, Australia

418
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:23,232
and New Zealand, and Japan.

419
00:42:35,402 --> 00:42:40,184
For the Splatoon European Championship, tournaments were held in nine different countries,

420
00:42:40,564 --> 00:42:44,266
with the winners gathering soon to decide who will reign supreme.

421
00:43:00,695 --> 00:43:04,457
And there are also many grassroots tournaments being organized by the community.

422
00:43:05,197 --> 00:43:11,160
For me, as a developer, there is nothing more rewarding than watching players from around the world

423
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:16,162
having fun playing a game I helped create, regardless of age, gender, or nationality.

424
00:43:16,182 --> 00:43:23,786
It is an honor for me to be evaluated as a highly competitive game by Splatoon and Splatoon 2.

425
00:43:23,906 --> 00:43:29,149
I am sweating while watching a serious match between high-level players.

426
00:43:30,884 --> 00:43:37,767
It's an honor for us to hear that people think Splatoon and Splatoon 2 have the potential for a really high level of competitive play.

427
00:43:38,547 --> 00:43:43,529
My hands still sweat a bit whenever I see high level players engaged in such intense battles.

428
00:43:56,733 --> 00:44:03,359
But our goal is for as many people as possible around the world to enjoy playing our game.

429
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:09,264
In Splatoon, competition allows these players to pursue the highest level of play that they're capable of.

430
00:44:22,861 --> 00:44:25,743
I want to continue to support them so that they can have such opportunities.

431
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:27,964
I was brought up in the gaming culture.

432
00:44:27,984 --> 00:44:30,906
I have many good memories from games and I am standing here as a developer.

433
00:44:53,302 --> 00:44:58,746
I'm someone who has grown up surrounded by, and was in part raised by, the culture of video games.

434
00:44:59,747 --> 00:45:02,889
Games have given me countless good memories and experiences,

435
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:05,591
and have made me the developer that I am today.

436
00:45:05,611 --> 00:45:09,974
And that may include games that some of you have had a hand in creating, or will someday create.

437
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:20,509
I hope that people will feel that games are great and interesting,

438
00:45:20,609 --> 00:45:24,352
and that they will continue to make games that will leave good memories,

439
00:45:24,372 --> 00:45:27,975
not only in the game, but also outside of the game.

440
00:45:28,916 --> 00:45:32,198
So it's my hope to continue this work of creating video games,

441
00:45:32,819 --> 00:45:37,262
both the actual games themselves and the experiences that extend beyond them,

442
00:45:37,862 --> 00:45:40,284
to give people their own lasting gaming memories,

443
00:45:40,785 --> 00:45:44,848
and to show as many people as possible how great our medium can truly be.

444
00:45:46,533 --> 00:45:46,917
Thank you very much.

445
00:45:46,937 --> 00:45:47,320
Thank you very much.

446
00:45:47,341 --> 00:45:47,825
Thank you.

447
00:45:47,866 --> 00:45:48,128
Thank you.

448
00:45:48,148 --> 00:45:48,714
Thank you very much.
