00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:12,006
Hello everybody. I'm Chris Martins and this is Rogelio Cardona Rivera. We are both at

2
00:00:12,046 --> 00:00:16,351
North Carolina State University and we're both really excited to be here to tell you

3
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:19,814
about some of the things that we've learned about as researchers.

4
00:00:20,975 --> 00:00:22,556
We are both researchers at NC State.

5
00:00:23,497 --> 00:00:25,058
I just started there as faculty in the fall,

6
00:00:25,198 --> 00:00:27,280
and Rogelio is finishing up his PhD.

7
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:31,823
I do work on tools for rapid prototyping

8
00:00:31,863 --> 00:00:32,763
of interactive stories,

9
00:00:33,364 --> 00:00:35,445
and Rogelio does work on computational models

10
00:00:35,465 --> 00:00:37,427
of how players think about interactive stories.

11
00:00:38,147 --> 00:00:39,468
So this is our first GDC talk.

12
00:00:39,808 --> 00:00:40,949
We are really excited.

13
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:46,093
We're kind of motivated by this idea that in,

14
00:00:46,933 --> 00:00:50,156
academia, we have a whole lot of techniques that people have

15
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:51,757
explored and debated over the years.

16
00:00:53,058 --> 00:00:55,760
And when I come to conferences like GDC, I talk to a lot of

17
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,022
people who are saying, I really want to create a

18
00:00:58,042 --> 00:01:00,004
procedural story, and I have no idea how to get started.

19
00:01:00,124 --> 00:01:03,567
So we're hoping that we can share with you some

20
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:05,768
interesting ideas and techniques that you may be

21
00:01:05,808 --> 00:01:06,749
able to use in your designs.

22
00:01:10,427 --> 00:01:14,031
A lot of academic work as well as a lot of early game

23
00:01:14,051 --> 00:01:17,856
development work started by sort of being inspired by this idea

24
00:01:18,396 --> 00:01:19,938
of the holodeck from Star Trek.

25
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:24,864
In other words, a simulated reality that affords not only

26
00:01:24,924 --> 00:01:27,267
the experience, an immersive experience of a story that you

27
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:27,968
can enter and

28
00:01:28,729 --> 00:01:32,094
take part in as a reader of sort of a script,

29
00:01:32,395 --> 00:01:36,021
but also a reality in which you can take improvised actions

30
00:01:36,141 --> 00:01:39,447
and have the system respond in a meaningful way

31
00:01:39,487 --> 00:01:40,248
to those reactions.

32
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:44,190
In the early days, this was kind of realized

33
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,571
through some of the early adventure games

34
00:01:47,012 --> 00:01:51,374
like the Hobbit DOS game from Beam Software in 1983.

35
00:01:52,054 --> 00:01:53,715
And on the surface, adventure games like this

36
00:01:53,755 --> 00:01:55,695
sort of seem to offer the promise of the holodeck,

37
00:01:55,736 --> 00:01:58,277
sort of showing you these first person images

38
00:01:58,397 --> 00:02:00,077
of spaces that you could inhabit

39
00:02:00,218 --> 00:02:01,978
and narrating story around you

40
00:02:02,018 --> 00:02:03,619
and allowing you to make some kind of choices.

41
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,444
And ultimately, these experiences centered a particular

42
00:02:09,484 --> 00:02:10,905
kind of plot and progression.

43
00:02:11,206 --> 00:02:13,368
They really wanted you to, in some sense,

44
00:02:13,428 --> 00:02:15,290
follow the script of what the designer had in mind,

45
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:18,633
but they're not very permissive of the kind of spontaneity

46
00:02:18,773 --> 00:02:21,156
and improvisation that people initially

47
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:24,859
sort of fantasy designed in the Star Trek holodeck.

48
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,903
More recently, people have been very excited about the idea

49
00:02:30,103 --> 00:02:34,046
of emergent gameplay realized by games like Dwarf Fortress,

50
00:02:34,767 --> 00:02:37,328
in which there's a rich simulation underlying

51
00:02:37,729 --> 00:02:40,291
this game system and players can,

52
00:02:40,871 --> 00:02:43,313
players and the artificial agents within the system

53
00:02:43,713 --> 00:02:46,596
can very much improvise and have the system respond.

54
00:02:47,656 --> 00:02:50,278
And then people perceive that there are narratives

55
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:52,860
that get overlaid on top of these experiences.

56
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:56,919
For example, many people like to post on Reddit

57
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,243
detailed descriptions of their narrative experiences

58
00:03:00,283 --> 00:03:03,687
within Dwarf Fortress that they think are really compelling.

59
00:03:05,072 --> 00:03:07,274
So this is sort of representative of the other end

60
00:03:07,314 --> 00:03:08,895
of the spectrum in a sense.

61
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:11,057
These experiences are very permissive of player

62
00:03:11,538 --> 00:03:14,220
and procedural spontaneity, but on the other hand,

63
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,782
there is no enforcement of sort of authored narrative arcs.

64
00:03:17,442 --> 00:03:19,504
So just as a working definition for those of you

65
00:03:19,524 --> 00:03:21,766
who may not have encountered the term procedural narrative

66
00:03:21,806 --> 00:03:24,268
generation before, I'm including both of these things

67
00:03:24,328 --> 00:03:27,110
under this umbrella term, and basically considering

68
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:28,511
any kind of automatic process

69
00:03:28,531 --> 00:03:29,973
that creates a narrative over time.

70
00:03:30,313 --> 00:03:32,275
where that narrative is not determined at the outset

71
00:03:32,776 --> 00:03:35,520
before the process begins to be procedural narrative

72
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,040
generation.

73
00:03:36,681 --> 00:03:38,784
So I've given a couple of examples,

74
00:03:38,864 --> 00:03:40,786
and I'm listing a few more here, including

75
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:43,189
some that I think are a bit lesser known that I'm really

76
00:03:43,249 --> 00:03:46,333
excited about as examples in procedural narrative

77
00:03:46,353 --> 00:03:46,754
generation.

78
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:50,215
And I kind of have these loosely following a spectrum

79
00:03:50,275 --> 00:03:52,355
of prioritizing agent spontaneity

80
00:03:53,256 --> 00:03:55,056
to prioritizing authorial structure.

81
00:03:55,496 --> 00:03:58,257
And largely what this talk is about is the challenge

82
00:03:58,497 --> 00:04:01,077
in first of all introducing agent spontaneity

83
00:04:01,097 --> 00:04:03,298
in the first place, this kind of improvisation

84
00:04:03,358 --> 00:04:06,419
and simulation, but also how to balance it

85
00:04:06,619 --> 00:04:08,179
with author structure.

86
00:04:10,027 --> 00:04:13,449
So going forward, I'm going to show you just a simple example

87
00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:15,230
that we can use to walk through a lot of the

88
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,231
terminology and ideas.

89
00:04:16,811 --> 00:04:19,553
And then we're going to go through in detail a couple of

90
00:04:19,613 --> 00:04:21,794
approaches, the simulation-centric approach and

91
00:04:21,814 --> 00:04:24,775
the plot-centric approach that have been really thoroughly

92
00:04:24,855 --> 00:04:26,396
explored in academic research.

93
00:04:27,137 --> 00:04:30,819
And then Rogelio will talk about the plot-centric

94
00:04:30,859 --> 00:04:33,600
approach, and he'll also conclude with some of the

95
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,522
ongoing challenges in procedural narrative

96
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:36,982
generation.

97
00:04:39,221 --> 00:04:42,463
So the example that we're going to start with is an Aesop

98
00:04:42,503 --> 00:04:46,586
fable, largely because Aesop fables tend to be relatively

99
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:51,529
simple and small and they can fit in a talk slide. So this is

100
00:04:51,829 --> 00:04:55,232
the ant and the dove. So a dove saw an ant fall into a brook.

101
00:04:55,792 --> 00:04:58,714
The ant struggled in vain to reach the bank and in pity the

102
00:04:58,734 --> 00:05:01,456
dove dropped a blade of straw close beside it. Clinging to the

103
00:05:01,476 --> 00:05:03,857
straw like a shipwrecked sailor to a broken spar, the ant

104
00:05:03,897 --> 00:05:04,738
floated safely to shore.

105
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:08,360
Soon after, the ant saw a man getting ready to kill the dove with a stone.

106
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:13,344
But just as he cast the stone, the ant stung him in the heel so that the pain made him miss his aim,

107
00:05:13,804 --> 00:05:15,725
and the startled dove flew to safety in a distant wood.

108
00:05:16,686 --> 00:05:19,107
The moral is at the bottom, a kindness is never wasted.

109
00:05:20,868 --> 00:05:23,529
When we start to think about how to introduce some kind of

110
00:05:23,569 --> 00:05:26,970
generativity into the story, or interactivity, which ideas

111
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:31,111
are closely interrelated, one technique that underlies a lot

112
00:05:31,172 --> 00:05:34,072
of, that opens up a lot of possibilities for

113
00:05:34,713 --> 00:05:36,873
procedurality, is logical modeling.

114
00:05:37,293 --> 00:05:40,114
So some kind of formal representation of who the

115
00:05:40,134 --> 00:05:43,155
characters are, and what situations they're in, and how

116
00:05:43,195 --> 00:05:45,696
those situations change across story events.

117
00:05:46,788 --> 00:05:49,889
So if we first think about discretizing this story

118
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,350
into kind of a comic book form,

119
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:54,751
where we show different narrative situations in each panel,

120
00:05:55,311 --> 00:05:58,652
we can start describing each situation

121
00:05:58,772 --> 00:06:00,893
in a sort of formal, logical form.

122
00:06:01,273 --> 00:06:03,254
So we can represent this first panel

123
00:06:03,294 --> 00:06:05,315
where the ant is near the stream,

124
00:06:05,695 --> 00:06:07,235
getting ready to fall into the stream,

125
00:06:07,455 --> 00:06:09,096
as the ant being thirsty

126
00:06:09,256 --> 00:06:10,516
and the ant being at the left shore.

127
00:06:12,517 --> 00:06:13,097
The next panel.

128
00:06:14,524 --> 00:06:21,606
as where the ant falls into the stream. We can represent that as at ant stream. And the dove is

129
00:06:21,646 --> 00:06:26,428
above the stream and so on for the rest of the panels in kind of the first half of this story.

130
00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:33,871
So that's our formal representation of a little example story. And now I'm going to go through

131
00:06:33,891 --> 00:06:38,953
the simulation centric approach. So the basic idea with this is that you're going to design,

132
00:06:39,414 --> 00:06:43,195
the author is going to design a bunch of characters and sort of world elements and

133
00:06:43,215 --> 00:06:43,655
identities.

134
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:48,701
in terms of their personalities, desires and relationships to one another. Then give a

135
00:06:48,821 --> 00:06:52,682
whole bunch of rules describing how these entities can interact with one another and

136
00:06:52,942 --> 00:06:57,203
potentially change those properties. Then you kind of throw them into a world and press play

137
00:06:57,243 --> 00:07:02,385
and see what they do. So you have your designer who is going to feed these interaction

138
00:07:02,425 --> 00:07:07,607
rules and initial state into a story generator and then that whole thing kind of gets

139
00:07:07,647 --> 00:07:12,508
packaged up and becomes an interactive narrative which then the player can interact with

140
00:07:12,628 --> 00:07:13,508
in the usual way by.

141
00:07:14,235 --> 00:07:15,876
submitting actions and receiving responses.

142
00:07:17,597 --> 00:07:19,157
So we're gonna zoom into specifically

143
00:07:19,237 --> 00:07:21,798
what the authoring process looks like

144
00:07:22,778 --> 00:07:23,859
for this kind of approach.

145
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:26,580
And we're gonna look at what interaction,

146
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,380
what it means to design interaction rules.

147
00:07:31,061 --> 00:07:33,702
So an interaction rule is basically

148
00:07:33,762 --> 00:07:36,063
a transition between story situations.

149
00:07:36,686 --> 00:07:42,889
basically going from the ant is beside the stream and thirsty to the ant being in the water. We

150
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:48,511
can label this transition with a story event like the ant falls into the stream. And to make

151
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:52,713
this formal we simply have to think about our logical representation of each of these

152
00:07:52,733 --> 00:07:56,475
situations and then give a formal label to this transition event.

153
00:07:59,156 --> 00:08:02,758
The next thing that we do in order to start introducing generativity into the story is

154
00:08:02,778 --> 00:08:03,859
to make the rule more general.

155
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:09,442
So I'm using a particular kind of quirky syntax with this question mark which designates a

156
00:08:09,482 --> 00:08:13,905
variable, which is an argument to the rule, that can range over any character.

157
00:08:14,025 --> 00:08:17,327
Basically any character can be substituted into this rule to have it apply to them.

158
00:08:18,047 --> 00:08:19,928
So we could say if someone is thirsty...

159
00:08:20,489 --> 00:08:25,273
someone is at a location somewhere and that somewhere happens to be near a stream, then one

160
00:08:25,313 --> 00:08:29,717
way their situation might transform is that they could fall into the stream and become in the

161
00:08:29,737 --> 00:08:34,642
stream. It's important to know that when we're representing things formally like this, we also

162
00:08:34,702 --> 00:08:39,466
have to make sure we're preserving information that doesn't change. So if our situation

163
00:08:39,867 --> 00:08:43,690
doesn't change the fact that this location is near the stream, we have to repeat it on the

164
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:44,131
other side.

165
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,367
So that's enough dense syntax for now.

166
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:49,407
We're going to go back to pictures.

167
00:08:50,688 --> 00:08:53,950
So we'll represent this kind of rule with a variable in it

168
00:08:54,111 --> 00:08:58,113
with this outline of a person to say if the person is

169
00:08:58,133 --> 00:09:00,275
thirsty and the person is near a stream, then the person

170
00:09:00,315 --> 00:09:01,115
can fall into the stream.

171
00:09:02,156 --> 00:09:04,057
So that's one way of introducing generativity is

172
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:07,880
sort of generalizing these interaction rules into things

173
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,701
that can be instantiated with multiple

174
00:09:09,741 --> 00:09:10,662
characters and entities.

175
00:09:11,722 --> 00:09:14,704
Another way is to introduce choices into the world,

176
00:09:14,784 --> 00:09:17,826
to sort of say that, well, if a person is near a stream

177
00:09:17,886 --> 00:09:19,848
and thirsty, then they might fall into the stream.

178
00:09:20,328 --> 00:09:22,289
We can label that rule drink fall.

179
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,891
On the other hand, we could have a rule called drink succeed

180
00:09:24,951 --> 00:09:26,352
in which they don't fall into the stream

181
00:09:26,412 --> 00:09:27,893
and simply stop being thirsty.

182
00:09:30,767 --> 00:09:36,476
Other kinds of interaction rules we can represent with this rule-based style include movement

183
00:09:36,496 --> 00:09:38,079
to locations.

184
00:09:38,219 --> 00:09:42,766
So if a character wants to move to a particular location that they happen to be near, then

185
00:09:42,807 --> 00:09:45,431
they can simply transition to being in that new location.

186
00:09:46,894 --> 00:09:49,556
More interestingly, perhaps, we can also represent

187
00:09:49,817 --> 00:09:50,858
social interaction rules.

188
00:09:51,378 --> 00:09:53,440
So we can say something like, if two characters,

189
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,301
X and Y, are in a shared location,

190
00:09:55,321 --> 00:09:59,525
and X doesn't like Y, then they can transition

191
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:01,266
into a situation where they don't like each other.

192
00:10:01,286 --> 00:10:04,669
And we can call this story event insulting.

193
00:10:05,249 --> 00:10:06,010
X insulting Y.

194
00:10:07,619 --> 00:10:10,020
We can also represent social interactions like helping.

195
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,921
So if somebody has a cure for,

196
00:10:12,941 --> 00:10:15,942
if somebody named X has a cure for an ailment

197
00:10:16,122 --> 00:10:19,263
that somebody named Y has, and X happens to like Y,

198
00:10:19,683 --> 00:10:24,384
then perhaps they spend the cure to get rid of the ailment

199
00:10:24,504 --> 00:10:25,865
and now Y is grateful to X.

200
00:10:28,207 --> 00:10:29,648
So those were just a few examples

201
00:10:29,868 --> 00:10:31,490
of the kinds of interaction rules

202
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,211
that you can create in a simulation.

203
00:10:33,872 --> 00:10:35,273
And then I mentioned before

204
00:10:35,313 --> 00:10:37,455
that you also have to feed in an initial state.

205
00:10:38,376 --> 00:10:39,397
So what does that look like?

206
00:10:40,498 --> 00:10:45,423
Initial state is simply a sequence of logical operators

207
00:10:45,703 --> 00:10:48,646
representing the situation that the story is in

208
00:10:48,706 --> 00:10:49,987
before the simulation begins.

209
00:10:51,255 --> 00:10:53,397
So for example, the dove being on the shore,

210
00:10:53,417 --> 00:10:59,380
or sorry, the dove being above the shore at the treetops,

211
00:10:59,421 --> 00:11:00,341
the ant being at the shore,

212
00:11:01,001 --> 00:11:02,943
and other properties of the world

213
00:11:02,983 --> 00:11:05,044
that will be manipulated by these rules.

214
00:11:07,927 --> 00:11:10,971
then when this is actually executed at run time,

215
00:11:11,612 --> 00:11:12,113
what happens?

216
00:11:12,353 --> 00:11:14,456
Okay, so the algorithmic concept is that

217
00:11:14,857 --> 00:11:17,601
our system is going to randomly explore the state space.

218
00:11:17,861 --> 00:11:19,904
And more concretely, as an example,

219
00:11:20,224 --> 00:11:21,426
what that might mean is that

220
00:11:22,107 --> 00:11:24,170
we start with some initial state, including the.

221
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:27,551
locations and relationships between the world entities.

222
00:11:28,331 --> 00:11:31,512
And then we take a random movement in a particular

223
00:11:31,532 --> 00:11:33,972
direction, like say, the ant moves to the stream.

224
00:11:34,232 --> 00:11:36,713
And note that the other part of the situation, wherever

225
00:11:36,753 --> 00:11:39,113
the dove is and which locations are near each other and so

226
00:11:39,194 --> 00:11:42,234
on, doesn't change across this transition.

227
00:11:43,634 --> 00:11:45,895
And then we can follow that with another part of the

228
00:11:45,915 --> 00:11:47,775
sequence where the dove moves to the stream.

229
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:50,376
Now both of the characters are in the same location and

230
00:11:50,396 --> 00:11:52,536
some interaction might take place between them.

231
00:11:53,536 --> 00:11:55,758
On the other hand, we might start from the initial state

232
00:11:56,018 --> 00:11:58,101
and first move the dove, and then move the ant,

233
00:11:58,241 --> 00:12:00,663
which takes us back to the same situation

234
00:12:00,723 --> 00:12:02,425
as doing so the other way around.

235
00:12:02,725 --> 00:12:04,727
So in doing this, we are creating not

236
00:12:04,987 --> 00:12:06,028
what you may be more familiar with,

237
00:12:06,128 --> 00:12:07,690
sort of like a branching story tree,

238
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,072
but rather a branching story graph

239
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:11,974
where things might connect to the same node.

240
00:12:11,994 --> 00:12:13,355
So.

241
00:12:16,089 --> 00:12:19,974
A concept that we could consider for generating stories

242
00:12:20,014 --> 00:12:22,336
includes randomly exploring the state space,

243
00:12:23,718 --> 00:12:26,321
but a perhaps more useful way to think about it

244
00:12:26,681 --> 00:12:28,623
as sort of interactive experience designers

245
00:12:28,904 --> 00:12:30,866
is that we can also include the player in the loop

246
00:12:31,286 --> 00:12:32,948
and allow them to control some of the steps

247
00:12:33,148 --> 00:12:33,849
through the state space.

248
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:40,514
whether it's a player or an automated decision maker taking

249
00:12:40,554 --> 00:12:44,697
these steps, we can consider each traversal through the state

250
00:12:44,717 --> 00:12:48,961
space to be approximately a story. So sometimes these things

251
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:51,683
may not be very interesting stories but some of them might

252
00:12:51,723 --> 00:12:54,705
be. So if the ant moves towards the stream and the dove moves

253
00:12:54,725 --> 00:12:57,667
towards the stream, the ant can insult the dove and the dove

254
00:12:57,687 --> 00:12:58,268
might eat the ant.

255
00:13:01,233 --> 00:13:02,734
In terms of interacting with simulations,

256
00:13:02,774 --> 00:13:04,936
there are, of course, a lot of design questions

257
00:13:04,976 --> 00:13:06,497
to ask for using this technique.

258
00:13:06,537 --> 00:13:10,020
So one of the biggest ones is, where is the locus of control?

259
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,261
How can the player intervene in the narrative?

260
00:13:12,441 --> 00:13:14,103
Are they playing as one character?

261
00:13:14,303 --> 00:13:17,345
Are they able to manipulate all of the characters in the story

262
00:13:17,385 --> 00:13:19,767
and completely control what takes place in the simulation?

263
00:13:20,928 --> 00:13:24,410
Or are they perhaps able only to subtly manipulate

264
00:13:24,451 --> 00:13:26,212
the world around the characters as they

265
00:13:26,252 --> 00:13:29,855
go about their daily activities using these interaction rules?

266
00:13:30,295 --> 00:13:32,416
and try to subtly manipulate their behavior in that way.

267
00:13:33,337 --> 00:13:35,198
There's a couple of examples I wanted to highlight,

268
00:13:35,619 --> 00:13:37,360
one of which is the game Prom Week,

269
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,222
which came out of research from UC Santa Cruz,

270
00:13:40,822 --> 00:13:44,164
in which the player does get to control all characters,

271
00:13:44,204 --> 00:13:45,205
but kind of one at a time.

272
00:13:45,305 --> 00:13:47,847
So they select one character who's the actor,

273
00:13:47,947 --> 00:13:49,508
and then another character that

274
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:51,650
that first character will act upon,

275
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:54,992
and they get to decide what kind of interaction

276
00:13:55,032 --> 00:13:58,034
will be started, but how that second character responds.

277
00:13:58,534 --> 00:14:05,560
is automated. Another example is Blood and Laurels, which uses the Versu storytelling engine.

278
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:11,905
In that case, it actually plays a lot like a traditional choice-based narrative, but all of

279
00:14:11,946 --> 00:14:16,870
the choices that are presented to you are generated by the simulation possibilities underlying the

280
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:22,875
world. With that, I am going to pass this off to Rogelio, who's going to tell you how to actually

281
00:14:22,935 --> 00:14:26,578
introduce some kind of control over your dramatic arcs that unfold.

282
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,617
Hi everybody, I'm super excited to be here.

283
00:14:32,378 --> 00:14:35,821
So, in order to set up a specific narrative progression,

284
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:39,265
which you won't have in the simulation-centric approach

285
00:14:39,305 --> 00:14:40,606
because you kind of get to decide

286
00:14:40,967 --> 00:14:42,768
where the narrative is going on the fly,

287
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,732
you need a way of specifying and enforcing goals,

288
00:14:45,932 --> 00:14:47,674
which is, again, achieved through the techniques

289
00:14:47,694 --> 00:14:48,454
that I'm gonna outline.

290
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:53,019
However, the plot-centric approach does build upon the simulation-centric approach.

291
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:57,203
So you need to describe what is the initial state of the narrative universe,

292
00:14:57,704 --> 00:15:02,449
as well as what are the interaction rules that allow the states of the universe to change.

293
00:15:03,953 --> 00:15:06,815
Additionally, you require a narrative agenda.

294
00:15:06,895 --> 00:15:09,216
So the agenda represents the desired plot

295
00:15:09,256 --> 00:15:11,897
that you as a narrative designer want to have happen

296
00:15:11,937 --> 00:15:15,499
in terms of the trajectory through the state space

297
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:16,459
that Chris was describing.

298
00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:19,160
So to give you a kind of diagrammatic representation

299
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,101
of what's going on, this is the diagram

300
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:22,262
that Chris finished upon.

301
00:15:22,982 --> 00:15:25,763
And we're gonna just shift the story generator to the left.

302
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,124
And in addition to specifying, like I said,

303
00:15:28,164 --> 00:15:29,825
the initial state and the interaction rules,

304
00:15:29,925 --> 00:15:31,766
you also have the narrative agenda.

305
00:15:32,546 --> 00:15:35,508
Now, the story generator in creating this story

306
00:15:35,628 --> 00:15:39,531
actually needs an additional agent, storytelling agent.

307
00:15:40,271 --> 00:15:43,113
And one will generate the partial story structure,

308
00:15:43,133 --> 00:15:43,914
which is the generator,

309
00:15:43,994 --> 00:15:46,676
and the other will try to enforce that story structure.

310
00:15:46,736 --> 00:15:49,478
So there's this idea that you have the narrative agenda

311
00:15:49,518 --> 00:15:51,299
that you want as a designer to have happen

312
00:15:51,419 --> 00:15:52,980
in the interactive narrative experience.

313
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,681
You now need an additional agent

314
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:56,583
that will monitor what the player is doing

315
00:15:56,763 --> 00:15:58,844
and try to get the player directed

316
00:15:59,104 --> 00:16:00,525
on that narrative trajectory.

317
00:16:02,014 --> 00:16:03,901
So the partial story is created.

318
00:16:04,802 --> 00:16:07,202
passes to this agent called a story mediator agent

319
00:16:07,242 --> 00:16:08,943
and the player once again takes actions

320
00:16:09,403 --> 00:16:10,803
that the mediator interprets.

321
00:16:11,443 --> 00:16:14,404
It then requests story content from the story generator

322
00:16:14,844 --> 00:16:17,424
which in turn in response to the player's actions

323
00:16:17,504 --> 00:16:18,885
creates this partial story

324
00:16:19,425 --> 00:16:21,425
and then delivers those responses to the player.

325
00:16:21,485 --> 00:16:23,266
So you can think of it as an iterative process

326
00:16:23,286 --> 00:16:26,587
that takes place between the player and the story system.

327
00:16:27,007 --> 00:16:29,767
Essentially they're taking turns advancing the chronology.

328
00:16:29,787 --> 00:16:33,008
So the player takes a turn in the interactive environment

329
00:16:33,068 --> 00:16:34,668
and then the system responds in turn.

330
00:16:34,688 --> 00:16:34,878
Thank you.

331
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,692
So like I said earlier, you have to describe

332
00:16:38,732 --> 00:16:41,253
the initial state as well as the interaction rules

333
00:16:41,293 --> 00:16:42,333
that can evolve states.

334
00:16:42,973 --> 00:16:44,673
The way that we approach authorship

335
00:16:44,733 --> 00:16:46,414
in this plot-centric approach is,

336
00:16:46,554 --> 00:16:48,534
again, I have an idea as a designer

337
00:16:48,634 --> 00:16:51,835
which of the states in that space are desirable,

338
00:16:52,175 --> 00:16:53,876
and that is the narrative agenda.

339
00:16:53,896 --> 00:16:55,756
So say for example, that at the end,

340
00:16:55,936 --> 00:16:58,917
I want the ant to be at the shore right,

341
00:16:59,437 --> 00:17:02,338
then what that does in terms of the simulated world

342
00:17:02,418 --> 00:17:04,358
is distinguish a state as desirable,

343
00:17:04,418 --> 00:17:05,418
which I've highlighted there.

344
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:07,179
in that alternative color.

345
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,242
So as we specify more conditions in the state space,

346
00:17:12,723 --> 00:17:14,424
we get a more specific trajectory

347
00:17:14,464 --> 00:17:15,604
of the interactive narrative.

348
00:17:15,664 --> 00:17:17,005
So the more that we specify,

349
00:17:17,365 --> 00:17:18,926
the more we have in terms of constraints

350
00:17:18,946 --> 00:17:21,408
of things that we as designers would like to have hit

351
00:17:21,928 --> 00:17:23,289
during the progression of the player.

352
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:26,416
And this sets up nicely the first technique

353
00:17:26,516 --> 00:17:27,517
in the plot-centric approach,

354
00:17:27,858 --> 00:17:29,059
which is this notion of beats.

355
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,262
So the idea that you have some state,

356
00:17:31,382 --> 00:17:32,804
you have the states of the state space

357
00:17:33,264 --> 00:17:35,887
and a subset of those states, which are the desired ones.

358
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:37,529
And in the literature,

359
00:17:37,549 --> 00:17:39,252
you'll find these referred to as beats.

360
00:17:40,503 --> 00:17:42,925
The second technique in the plot-centric approach

361
00:17:43,265 --> 00:17:45,467
is this notion of turn-taking, which I kind of alluded to.

362
00:17:45,527 --> 00:17:47,388
And you can think of it through an analogy

363
00:17:47,449 --> 00:17:49,270
through Dungeons and Dragons,

364
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:50,811
when you roll for initiative, right?

365
00:17:51,252 --> 00:17:54,174
You, the DM, have players roll for initiative,

366
00:17:54,214 --> 00:17:56,236
establish the turn order of players,

367
00:17:56,596 --> 00:17:59,198
then the players go and the DM responds in kind.

368
00:17:59,258 --> 00:18:01,079
So the DM and the players take turns

369
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,761
advancing the narrative arc.

370
00:18:03,121 --> 00:18:04,923
So the same principle applies here.

371
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:08,049
From the initial state, the player is allotted

372
00:18:08,429 --> 00:18:10,091
or afforded the opportunity to take action

373
00:18:10,171 --> 00:18:10,951
in the state space.

374
00:18:11,292 --> 00:18:13,994
And then the system is allowed to respond in kind.

375
00:18:14,014 --> 00:18:16,577
And so this continues throughout the progression

376
00:18:16,757 --> 00:18:17,938
of the plot structure.

377
00:18:19,481 --> 00:18:21,762
And the third technique is that idea of mediation,

378
00:18:21,802 --> 00:18:22,863
which I talked about earlier,

379
00:18:23,323 --> 00:18:26,665
the notion that there are some actions in that state space

380
00:18:27,025 --> 00:18:28,645
which essentially take us away

381
00:18:28,906 --> 00:18:30,286
from the desired plot points.

382
00:18:30,426 --> 00:18:32,247
So we have the beats that we have specified

383
00:18:32,647 --> 00:18:33,628
in the narrative trajectory,

384
00:18:34,268 --> 00:18:37,130
and any action that takes us away from those beats

385
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:39,691
from the system's perspective constitutes an exception.

386
00:18:40,131 --> 00:18:41,532
We want to avoid those

387
00:18:41,572 --> 00:18:43,253
because we want to hit those plot points

388
00:18:43,593 --> 00:18:45,654
during the progression of the player's experience.

389
00:18:46,174 --> 00:18:48,635
So those dotted arrows that I'm highlighting in the diagram

390
00:18:48,936 --> 00:18:50,797
represent those exceptional actions.

391
00:18:50,877 --> 00:18:53,838
And so if we consider these beats to be hard constraints,

392
00:18:53,878 --> 00:18:56,560
so we don't want the player to deviate from these beats,

393
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,842
then the system must fail the user's action

394
00:19:00,082 --> 00:19:01,663
when the player tries to take that,

395
00:19:02,203 --> 00:19:04,384
or never present the action in the first place.

396
00:19:05,105 --> 00:19:07,346
And otherwise, the system will accept

397
00:19:07,506 --> 00:19:09,867
the player's action during the experience.

398
00:19:10,488 --> 00:19:12,930
There's actually a third option here, replanning.

399
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:14,772
But this requires a story generator.

400
00:19:14,992 --> 00:19:16,894
In essence, if the player tries to deviate

401
00:19:17,014 --> 00:19:18,856
from the beat path and you have access

402
00:19:18,876 --> 00:19:20,257
to a story generation system,

403
00:19:20,817 --> 00:19:23,320
then you can request additional story content

404
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,462
to try to replan the experience

405
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:26,843
around the player's interaction.

406
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:29,726
And find a story that gets us back on track.

407
00:19:31,082 --> 00:19:33,283
During runtime, the plot-centric technique

408
00:19:33,363 --> 00:19:35,845
is all about deciding how to evolve the story

409
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,646
in response to the player's actions.

410
00:19:38,026 --> 00:19:40,688
So like I said earlier, the player in the initial state

411
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:43,110
will decide what action to pursue for the narrative plot.

412
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:46,852
Then when the system's turn is up,

413
00:19:47,413 --> 00:19:50,195
it will suggest, or the story manager will suggest

414
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:52,837
which action will get us closer to a narrative beat.

415
00:19:53,277 --> 00:19:54,858
And so this interaction, like I said,

416
00:19:54,878 --> 00:19:56,099
it's a turn-taking mechanism,

417
00:19:56,399 --> 00:19:57,900
and every time the system is afforded

418
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,041
the opportunity to interact.

419
00:19:59,521 --> 00:20:02,603
it will choose an action that will get us closer

420
00:20:02,683 --> 00:20:03,884
to the narrative beats.

421
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:06,766
So some plot-centric examples,

422
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,268
and I have to call out facade

423
00:20:09,328 --> 00:20:11,990
because it is an unstated rule in academic talks

424
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,291
that reference interactive narrative

425
00:20:13,311 --> 00:20:15,112
that facade must appear at some point.

426
00:20:16,844 --> 00:20:18,125
part of the PhD manual.

427
00:20:19,387 --> 00:20:21,549
So facade is an example where you have the player

428
00:20:21,669 --> 00:20:23,812
afforded the opportunity to interact in the environment,

429
00:20:23,852 --> 00:20:26,735
but invariably you will hit some specific plot points.

430
00:20:27,256 --> 00:20:29,318
Of course, the trajectory that you take

431
00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:33,103
to get to those beats will affect the way

432
00:20:33,163 --> 00:20:34,725
that the experience culminates.

433
00:20:35,794 --> 00:20:38,236
Another example is a game that was developed

434
00:20:38,336 --> 00:20:40,417
at North Carolina State by Justice Robertson

435
00:20:40,477 --> 00:20:42,598
called Base Case, which in essence,

436
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:45,840
the interactive environment is procedurally generated

437
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,621
in response to the player's actions.

438
00:20:47,961 --> 00:20:50,203
But it's also with this notion of turn-taking.

439
00:20:50,263 --> 00:20:53,465
So every time the player acts, the system responds in kind

440
00:20:53,725 --> 00:20:55,986
and actually can manipulate things behind the scenes

441
00:20:56,286 --> 00:20:59,468
to try to make sure that the player's plot progression

442
00:20:59,608 --> 00:21:00,489
is as intended.

443
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:04,239
So that concludes the plot-centric approach,

444
00:21:04,299 --> 00:21:05,520
and I want to shift over to talking about

445
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,881
some challenges in New Frontiers.

446
00:21:07,681 --> 00:21:11,964
So one big challenge that we're currently facing

447
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:13,405
as an academic research community

448
00:21:13,846 --> 00:21:15,647
is going from this plot-centric approach

449
00:21:16,087 --> 00:21:17,909
to a more discourse-centric approach.

450
00:21:18,649 --> 00:21:20,971
So this is in service of what Emily Short

451
00:21:20,991 --> 00:21:23,493
has called out before, which is there's no need

452
00:21:23,733 --> 00:21:25,254
to simulate part of the environment

453
00:21:25,274 --> 00:21:27,636
that ultimately will not be told to players

454
00:21:27,656 --> 00:21:28,857
because it's not relevant.

455
00:21:29,057 --> 00:21:30,559
If it doesn't in some way advance

456
00:21:30,939 --> 00:21:32,240
the interactive narrative experience,

457
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,921
there's no point in talking about it

458
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:35,142
at the simulation level.

459
00:21:35,983 --> 00:21:39,686
So traditionally, systems have gone from this simulation approach where you generate

460
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:44,110
the simulation of the story world through its state space, and then you pick and choose and

461
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:49,575
present over that state space and lay a discourse above it. And that's ultimately what is presented

462
00:21:49,936 --> 00:21:50,696
to players.

463
00:21:52,241 --> 00:21:53,842
Ideally, we like to go the other way around.

464
00:21:53,882 --> 00:21:56,363
So the simulation of an un-narrated part of the story

465
00:21:56,443 --> 00:21:57,403
is unnecessary.

466
00:21:57,883 --> 00:21:59,844
Chris and I actually have been investigating new models

467
00:21:59,884 --> 00:22:03,485
of communication, understanding what is it that we have

468
00:22:03,525 --> 00:22:06,727
to communicate to a player, and then figuring out

469
00:22:06,767 --> 00:22:08,527
the simulation in service of that.

470
00:22:08,587 --> 00:22:09,848
And I hope to continue that.

471
00:22:09,868 --> 00:22:10,988
That's really exciting work, I think.

472
00:22:12,154 --> 00:22:14,416
Another challenge is this idea of scaling.

473
00:22:14,556 --> 00:22:18,920
So, NanoGenMo, the National Novel Generation Month,

474
00:22:19,021 --> 00:22:23,405
where you have one month to create an AI system

475
00:22:23,445 --> 00:22:26,688
that generates a 50,000 word novel, that's correct.

476
00:22:28,396 --> 00:22:30,778
Clearly we are not in a state as a community

477
00:22:30,818 --> 00:22:32,359
where we can do this automatically.

478
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:34,441
And ideally we would want to scale

479
00:22:34,961 --> 00:22:36,823
our interactive narrative generation systems

480
00:22:37,223 --> 00:22:40,666
to encompass a wider story experience.

481
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:43,368
There's an interesting problem in that

482
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:46,230
in trying to write a small amount of interaction rules

483
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,052
that generate a large body of text.

484
00:22:48,092 --> 00:22:50,374
So what is, I guess, the minimal amount of authoring

485
00:22:50,394 --> 00:22:52,576
that we have to do in terms of input to these systems

486
00:22:52,896 --> 00:22:55,158
to get a wide array of output?

487
00:22:57,629 --> 00:22:58,529
So some parting thoughts.

488
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:02,193
One thing that we feel procedural narrative generation

489
00:23:02,373 --> 00:23:05,155
will get us toward is opening up the possibility

490
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:07,617
in terms of interactive story experiences.

491
00:23:08,058 --> 00:23:09,599
So Jesper Juul talks about this idea

492
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:11,881
of progression versus emergence

493
00:23:12,081 --> 00:23:13,963
in terms of the kinds of games that exist.

494
00:23:14,584 --> 00:23:17,545
And the basic idea is that you have games in narrative

495
00:23:17,985 --> 00:23:20,846
about progression where you have a very linear

496
00:23:20,926 --> 00:23:23,207
structured plot, something like what you would find

497
00:23:23,267 --> 00:23:24,328
in The Secret of Monkey Island,

498
00:23:24,848 --> 00:23:29,050
where you have some space to explore interactions,

499
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:33,192
but the main plot kind of progresses like checkpoints.

500
00:23:33,432 --> 00:23:35,513
You do some actions in the environment,

501
00:23:35,793 --> 00:23:37,174
you progress to the next plot point,

502
00:23:37,214 --> 00:23:38,855
and the progression is very tied

503
00:23:38,955 --> 00:23:40,355
to your interactive experience.

504
00:23:40,955 --> 00:23:42,616
Contrast that with a game of Emergence.

505
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:46,298
where, like for example in Civilization,

506
00:23:46,678 --> 00:23:48,218
where you can think of games of emergence

507
00:23:48,398 --> 00:23:51,560
as games that are simple to learn and difficult to master.

508
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,841
And so the narrative or the narrativization

509
00:23:55,021 --> 00:23:57,262
of your experience happens through the interactions

510
00:23:57,542 --> 00:23:58,982
that you have in that game.

511
00:24:00,163 --> 00:24:02,283
Chris and I feel that procedural narrative generation

512
00:24:02,644 --> 00:24:04,284
can help move story games,

513
00:24:04,344 --> 00:24:06,825
which have traditionally been games of progression,

514
00:24:07,165 --> 00:24:09,305
to explore games of emergence.

515
00:24:09,486 --> 00:24:11,286
And this is not to say that these story systems,

516
00:24:11,846 --> 00:24:12,786
one is better than the other,

517
00:24:13,227 --> 00:24:15,447
but we feel that developing these tools and techniques

518
00:24:15,507 --> 00:24:17,508
allow us to explore narrative games

519
00:24:17,548 --> 00:24:19,368
that exist beyond their traditional mold.

520
00:24:21,301 --> 00:24:24,762
And lastly, we're both very excited about this,

521
00:24:25,643 --> 00:24:27,463
we have a new resource to share with y'all,

522
00:24:28,024 --> 00:24:30,865
the storygen.org website, which should be live,

523
00:24:30,925 --> 00:24:33,526
and hopefully you won't give it a hug of death

524
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:34,686
and then knock it out.

525
00:24:36,467 --> 00:24:39,288
But, so we've compiled a list of procedural narrative

526
00:24:39,308 --> 00:24:42,930
generators that represent systems that you can download

527
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:45,031
and play with, and we recognize, of course,

528
00:24:45,071 --> 00:24:47,432
that this is, some of it is still research software,

529
00:24:47,472 --> 00:24:49,713
but hopefully that you can actually play with and use

530
00:24:50,013 --> 00:24:52,194
to explore these interesting narrative designs

531
00:24:52,234 --> 00:24:52,815
going forward.

532
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:58,365
So as a recap, so we've covered the simulation-centric

533
00:24:58,405 --> 00:24:59,585
approach and plot-centric approaches,

534
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:01,986
and like I said just now, what we have presented

535
00:25:02,046 --> 00:25:03,687
is not normative.

536
00:25:03,807 --> 00:25:06,808
Designers still have to decide what the experience will be,

537
00:25:07,308 --> 00:25:09,109
and hopefully the technology that we've developed

538
00:25:09,129 --> 00:25:11,750
in our community can help enable those experiences.

539
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:13,871
We've talked very briefly about some challenges

540
00:25:13,891 --> 00:25:15,812
in New Frontiers, and we really encourage you

541
00:25:15,852 --> 00:25:17,293
to visit storygen.org.

542
00:25:17,713 --> 00:25:19,273
Hopefully you will be able to suggest.

543
00:25:19,674 --> 00:25:23,680
new systems, we'd love to have that array of procedural

544
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,982
narrative generators expanded.

545
00:25:25,623 --> 00:25:27,085
And that's it.

546
00:25:27,406 --> 00:25:29,469
I'm Rogelio Cardona-Rivera, this was Chris Martens.

547
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:30,331
Thank you very much.
