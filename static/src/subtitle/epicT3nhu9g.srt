1
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,783
I'm Lane Nooney, I'm your speaker for the next 30 minutes.

2
00:00:08,903 --> 00:00:14,388
I have been requested to make some announcements, including to please silence your phones or

3
00:00:14,488 --> 00:00:16,210
anything else you have on you that makes noise.

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:22,416
And to remember to, as I understand it, evaluations are very important to this process, so whether

5
00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:27,680
you enjoy this, hate this, or feel merely lukewarm, please fill out your evaluations

6
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,282
after this talk.

7
00:00:29,862 --> 00:00:30,863
So I'm Lane Nooney.

8
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:33,224
I'm an assistant professor of digital media

9
00:00:33,404 --> 00:00:34,885
at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

10
00:00:35,265 --> 00:00:37,406
I'm a computer and video game historian.

11
00:00:37,726 --> 00:00:38,967
If you've heard of me before,

12
00:00:39,467 --> 00:00:42,349
it's probably because you know that I'm working on a book

13
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:45,510
on the kind of cultural and industry history of Sierra Online

14
00:00:46,191 --> 00:00:48,712
which has been kind of my primary research project

15
00:00:48,752 --> 00:00:49,893
for the past few years.

16
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,814
It will get done one day, I promise.

17
00:00:52,734 --> 00:00:55,135
But I'm here to offer something a little different.

18
00:00:55,596 --> 00:00:55,896
I've been...

19
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:01,192
sort of circulating around in the game industry as a historian of this industry for some time,

20
00:01:01,292 --> 00:01:07,034
and it's kind of led me to compile some thoughts about how I think these two, in some ways,

21
00:01:07,094 --> 00:01:13,057
alternate professions can learn to speak better to one another if we get some foundation in what

22
00:01:13,077 --> 00:01:21,081
it is that history involves and what it does. So, all right, I'm gonna go. Okay, so I want to begin

23
00:01:22,521 --> 00:01:25,383
by looking at some stuff that we've saved over time.

24
00:01:27,372 --> 00:01:29,836
So you may recognize this as the Bayeux Tapestry,

25
00:01:30,016 --> 00:01:32,440
an embroidered cloth 230 feet long,

26
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,663
depicting the Norman invasion of England

27
00:01:34,743 --> 00:01:35,604
by William the Conqueror.

28
00:01:35,624 --> 00:01:37,607
It was constructed in the 11th century.

29
00:01:37,647 --> 00:01:38,849
It's made of wool and linen,

30
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:40,571
and it's been with us for about 1,000 years.

31
00:01:42,787 --> 00:01:47,330
This is the Code of Hammurabi, one of the oldest deciphered writings of significant length in the world,

32
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,771
enacted by the Babylonian king of that name.

33
00:01:50,231 --> 00:01:52,632
It dates back to 1750 BCE,

34
00:01:53,373 --> 00:01:56,474
and the code still exists today in the form of stone and clay tablets.

35
00:01:57,015 --> 00:01:58,656
This artifact has been with us for 3,500 years.

36
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:04,010
Sit.

37
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:04,410
Nope.

38
00:02:04,671 --> 00:02:05,011
Come on.

39
00:02:05,151 --> 00:02:05,571
There we go.

40
00:02:05,891 --> 00:02:06,152
Sorry.

41
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:06,832
Gave it away.

42
00:02:07,693 --> 00:02:10,314
This is the Treaty of Waitangi, signed

43
00:02:10,334 --> 00:02:12,976
between Maori chiefs of New Zealand and the British Crown

44
00:02:13,136 --> 00:02:16,378
in 1841, declaring British rule over the islands.

45
00:02:16,718 --> 00:02:18,219
This has been with us for precisely 176 years.

46
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,593
And then we have a five and a quarter floppy disk.

47
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:27,577
In the definitional sense, a standard data storage platform

48
00:02:27,617 --> 00:02:29,479
of the late 70s through the 1980s.

49
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,903
The shelf life is 30 years, if you're lucky.

50
00:02:33,123 --> 00:02:34,785
35 if you're Jason Scott, maybe.

51
00:02:36,947 --> 00:02:38,609
One laugh, all right, there we go.

52
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:40,050
Thank you.

53
00:02:41,207 --> 00:02:46,390
So all of man's technological might, right, the end result of decades of effort in chemistry,

54
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:51,693
physics, electronics, and magnetism got us a disc that any composition notebook could outlast.

55
00:02:52,394 --> 00:02:56,937
And if you're imagining here that the floppy disc was just a kind of brief stepping stone

56
00:02:56,977 --> 00:03:01,960
on the journey to informational ubiquity and freedom of access, where we can now live in

57
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,363
this world where data is never farther away than the cloud, where we reside, kind of where our

58
00:03:06,423 --> 00:03:08,884
Google inbox archives will never be full.

59
00:03:09,678 --> 00:03:13,919
I would ask how many of you, if you walked out onto 4th Street and got hit by an Uber,

60
00:03:14,539 --> 00:03:18,401
how many of you could guarantee that your co-workers or your friends or your partner

61
00:03:18,801 --> 00:03:20,622
could make any sense of your desktop?

62
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:24,023
Could parse your emails?

63
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:27,610
could print out your Slack, right?

64
00:03:28,251 --> 00:03:30,472
What exactly is the historical status

65
00:03:30,552 --> 00:03:31,993
of your Kickstarter updates, right?

66
00:03:32,233 --> 00:03:33,874
Do you actually think you're going to be able

67
00:03:33,935 --> 00:03:35,856
to access Kickstarter in 150 years?

68
00:03:37,657 --> 00:03:41,019
So we can't even get past two-factor authentication

69
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:42,240
if our phone's dead, right?

70
00:03:43,121 --> 00:03:46,343
So in this kind of world, what hope do you have for history?

71
00:03:47,128 --> 00:03:50,910
when any email you write will be harder to trace and more difficult to extract

72
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:55,733
from the digital systems it lives in than what kings carved on a rock 4,000 years ago.

73
00:03:57,895 --> 00:04:03,858
So every year at GDC, there's efforts to honor history. There's barnstormer talks about the

74
00:04:03,918 --> 00:04:08,441
frantic need for preservation and the captivating efforts of folks like Jason Scott at the Internet

75
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:10,623
Archive to save the history of games.

76
00:04:11,928 --> 00:04:13,769
There's postmortems on classic games,

77
00:04:13,809 --> 00:04:16,572
like the one that will be coming up on Oregon Trail,

78
00:04:17,072 --> 00:04:19,034
or kind of eager historical readings

79
00:04:19,114 --> 00:04:20,715
on some vintage game or another.

80
00:04:20,775 --> 00:04:23,237
This is how history tends to flow at GDC.

81
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:25,599
And so it would have been very easy for me,

82
00:04:25,679 --> 00:04:28,382
as a professional kind of computer and game historian,

83
00:04:28,722 --> 00:04:31,684
to apply to these ranks to give a talk like this, right?

84
00:04:32,345 --> 00:04:33,786
And as I mentioned in the beginning,

85
00:04:33,926 --> 00:04:36,348
so if you have seen me speak in public before,

86
00:04:37,329 --> 00:04:38,710
this is what you know me for, right?

87
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:39,831
My work on Sierra Online.

88
00:04:40,744 --> 00:04:42,864
on the 1980s and 90s adventure game publisher.

89
00:04:44,404 --> 00:04:49,185
But I'm not here today because I want to tell another story about Ken and Roberta Williams,

90
00:04:49,546 --> 00:04:50,846
King's Quest, or Mystery House.

91
00:04:51,586 --> 00:04:53,506
I'm here because I want to take this industry's...

92
00:04:54,087 --> 00:04:58,368
Because if we want to take this industry's history seriously, as I know every person

93
00:04:58,408 --> 00:05:01,648
who bothered to show up at this panel probably does, right?

94
00:05:02,048 --> 00:05:06,769
I think we need to stop thinking that telling stories is enough, or saving our code is enough,

95
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,790
or throwing up old documents on the internet is enough.

96
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:13,834
which is to say that none of those are necessarily bad tactics.

97
00:05:14,674 --> 00:05:18,098
But I want to pivot this conversation, I think, because we could take this deeper.

98
00:05:18,398 --> 00:05:22,362
I think we've actually done a pretty okay job getting older stuff saved.

99
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,824
Not great, but I'll file it under okay.

100
00:05:25,485 --> 00:05:29,969
But none of that seems to have done much to raise the bar for the history we consume.

101
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:34,713
So, so much of it still exists in the realm of blog posts that are surely going to disappear

102
00:05:34,753 --> 00:05:39,237
off the internet one day, or kind of dazzling, forgettable books written by pop journalists

103
00:05:39,257 --> 00:05:41,418
looking to transform your nostalgia into cash.

104
00:05:42,179 --> 00:05:45,862
And after a while, we remember it all kind of winds up sounding alike, right?

105
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:50,766
So much historical writing seems to rely on us responding to the past with awe, rather

106
00:05:50,806 --> 00:05:51,507
than understanding.

107
00:05:52,307 --> 00:05:57,291
Or as I've put it in other venues, good history should make the present strange, not the past.

108
00:05:58,308 --> 00:05:59,809
And so what I want to talk about today

109
00:05:59,929 --> 00:06:01,291
is in the service of developing what

110
00:06:01,331 --> 00:06:03,993
I would call a historical literacy within the game

111
00:06:04,033 --> 00:06:04,413
industry.

112
00:06:04,954 --> 00:06:07,696
So not our ability to memorize a bunch of facts about game

113
00:06:07,717 --> 00:06:10,539
history or to fight about who invented the first video game

114
00:06:10,619 --> 00:06:12,781
as if that was ever an interesting conversation,

115
00:06:13,362 --> 00:06:16,344
but to address our kind of shared and mutual understanding

116
00:06:16,384 --> 00:06:18,466
of what history is, what it aims to do,

117
00:06:18,787 --> 00:06:20,448
and how we can be part of that process.

118
00:06:21,983 --> 00:06:24,305
So I've divided this talk into four brief parts.

119
00:06:25,045 --> 00:06:27,587
First is some groundwork to help us understand

120
00:06:27,627 --> 00:06:29,207
what historians do, how they think,

121
00:06:29,568 --> 00:06:31,749
and why they care about history for different reasons

122
00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:33,310
than industry professionals.

123
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,211
Second is a call to expand our understanding

124
00:06:36,231 --> 00:06:37,572
of what constitutes history,

125
00:06:37,852 --> 00:06:39,753
so to think bigger about what the future needs.

126
00:06:40,474 --> 00:06:45,797
Third is to dispel the pernicious myth that the digital era solves preservation problems.

127
00:06:46,337 --> 00:06:51,501
And I'll close not necessarily with a takeaway, but something of a decree for what the industry

128
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:55,783
at large, and possibly some of us were at small, could do to take action on the very

129
00:06:55,823 --> 00:06:58,025
real problems that face our historical efforts.

130
00:07:00,704 --> 00:07:04,166
So I would estimate that one of the greatest unexpected threats

131
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:07,327
to the sustainability of historical research within games

132
00:07:07,747 --> 00:07:11,309
is the gap in values between individual industry practitioners

133
00:07:11,409 --> 00:07:14,130
like yourselves, who want to see your creative output

134
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,791
and your unique culture preserved,

135
00:07:16,351 --> 00:07:18,452
and the professional historians who

136
00:07:18,492 --> 00:07:20,393
will do the work of writing histories

137
00:07:20,513 --> 00:07:21,474
based on such artifacts.

138
00:07:22,355 --> 00:07:26,760
So the pressure of this gap is actually kind of already foretold if you look at domains like film studies,

139
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:32,046
where there's a kind of a divide at the educational level between people who teach history and critical inquiry

140
00:07:32,306 --> 00:07:35,209
and people who teach practice, right? They're kind of often kept apart.

141
00:07:36,691 --> 00:07:39,635
And so right now, game history is in this sort of in-between space,

142
00:07:40,115 --> 00:07:42,558
where most of the people associated with historical work

143
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:47,942
are themselves first or second generation game designers, digital archivists, journalists,

144
00:07:48,622 --> 00:07:50,003
independent non-fiction authors.

145
00:07:50,043 --> 00:07:54,426
So we have folks like Frank Capualdi, Harold Goldberg, Jason Scott, John Romero, Warren

146
00:07:54,446 --> 00:07:54,826
Spector.

147
00:07:55,046 --> 00:07:58,388
These are kind of the names that might come to mind if you're thinking about who knows

148
00:07:58,448 --> 00:07:59,109
about history.

149
00:08:00,472 --> 00:08:03,273
Very few of you, I can imagine, could name someone, perhaps

150
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:06,494
besides me now, who is sustainably employed just

151
00:08:06,674 --> 00:08:07,474
to do this work.

152
00:08:08,474 --> 00:08:10,835
But film was there once, as was the history of computing.

153
00:08:10,855 --> 00:08:12,855
In fact, all industries go through a phase

154
00:08:12,955 --> 00:08:15,416
where the first generation of historians are practitioners,

155
00:08:15,956 --> 00:08:21,077
and then come the professionals, quote unquote.

156
00:08:21,357 --> 00:08:23,338
This is something that has kind of happened historically,

157
00:08:23,418 --> 00:08:25,378
cyclically over the 20th century.

158
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:29,239
So this is what you get if you Google image search historian.

159
00:08:30,678 --> 00:08:32,761
Apparently, sometimes we are cartoons.

160
00:08:33,382 --> 00:08:35,867
We are mostly old white men reading books, apparently.

161
00:08:35,887 --> 00:08:41,497
Although I'm really pumped about the image of the woman on a laptop eating a giant cookie

162
00:08:41,617 --> 00:08:42,198
in the third row.

163
00:08:43,763 --> 00:08:47,807
So I promise, despite what this wall of images might suggest,

164
00:08:48,507 --> 00:08:50,349
that there's nothing really to be scared of

165
00:08:50,449 --> 00:08:53,331
in a professional historian so long as we understand

166
00:08:53,451 --> 00:08:54,552
one another's values.

167
00:08:54,973 --> 00:08:57,435
And what I mean by that is, if I were

168
00:08:57,575 --> 00:09:00,177
to ask anyone in this room, why do we care about history?

169
00:09:00,578 --> 00:09:02,519
There's a few answers I would anticipate

170
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,982
from a room of industry professionals, educators,

171
00:09:05,062 --> 00:09:05,682
and journalists.

172
00:09:06,143 --> 00:09:07,764
So there's usually a big emphasis

173
00:09:07,884 --> 00:09:09,686
on wanting historical materials to help

174
00:09:09,806 --> 00:09:11,007
teach future generations.

175
00:09:11,648 --> 00:09:14,290
There's a desire to learn from past failure and success,

176
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:17,172
to have access to inspiration, to protect legacies,

177
00:09:17,532 --> 00:09:20,034
and sometimes just that vague emotion

178
00:09:20,074 --> 00:09:21,135
that we call nostalgia.

179
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:25,764
But historians have kind of distinct reasons

180
00:09:25,864 --> 00:09:27,765
for being interested in the history of games.

181
00:09:28,165 --> 00:09:30,127
So we sort of obey different masters, right?

182
00:09:30,167 --> 00:09:31,587
We have different professional agendas.

183
00:09:31,888 --> 00:09:33,789
And we take different positions relative

184
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:34,829
to why history matters.

185
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,871
So much of that has to do with the training and education

186
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:41,053
of a historian, which may be six or eight additional years

187
00:09:41,393 --> 00:09:44,395
beyond college, and the kind of work that is required of us

188
00:09:44,475 --> 00:09:45,476
to secure employment.

189
00:09:46,248 --> 00:09:49,811
So issues of legacy, valorization, and nostalgia don't motivate me.

190
00:09:50,992 --> 00:09:55,096
What does motivate me is the unique kinds of historical problems that exist within the

191
00:09:55,116 --> 00:09:55,856
history of games.

192
00:09:56,217 --> 00:10:00,400
And so like any professional, I am interested in the questions shaped by my profession.

193
00:10:01,141 --> 00:10:04,884
So while many of us might think that history is an end product, something that we consume

194
00:10:04,924 --> 00:10:08,027
or absorb, historians relate to history as a verb.

195
00:10:08,727 --> 00:10:09,768
This is something we do.

196
00:10:09,868 --> 00:10:10,528
It's a mechanic.

197
00:10:11,369 --> 00:10:13,010
It's one part science, one part art.

198
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,371
It's a lot like game design, maybe.

199
00:10:15,731 --> 00:10:17,833
Historians relate to history not as this sort

200
00:10:17,853 --> 00:10:20,094
of great chain of facts, but as a field

201
00:10:20,214 --> 00:10:21,775
open to possible interpretation.

202
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:23,416
And so facts are actually the easy part

203
00:10:23,516 --> 00:10:24,597
once you've done history long enough.

204
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,438
Interpretation is the hard part.

205
00:10:26,818 --> 00:10:28,459
Putting things into context, determining

206
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:32,101
what is cause and effect, reading contradictory accounts

207
00:10:32,141 --> 00:10:34,762
and deciding what might be valid.

208
00:10:36,262 --> 00:10:38,686
And so this is what historians do, and this is what they love.

209
00:10:39,266 --> 00:10:41,369
History is a space of contesting ideas,

210
00:10:41,429 --> 00:10:44,393
not a platform for some objective idea of the past.

211
00:10:45,215 --> 00:10:48,619
So when we talk about why we save or who we are saving for,

212
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,343
bear in mind that person's foremost allegiance

213
00:10:51,383 --> 00:10:53,826
will likely not be to games, but to history.

214
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,008
And the important takeaway here is to encourage patience, right,

215
00:10:57,048 --> 00:10:59,630
in understanding one another's values on all sides.

216
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:02,412
The harder we push for expanding our historical stakes,

217
00:11:02,812 --> 00:11:05,554
the more these different values would really risk butting heads, I think,

218
00:11:06,395 --> 00:11:08,876
and cratering collaboration before it could even start.

219
00:11:09,176 --> 00:11:12,018
And so I think as if we start from a place of kind of awareness

220
00:11:12,058 --> 00:11:15,500
of why individual practitioners are drawn to this shared space,

221
00:11:15,861 --> 00:11:17,322
I think we can get a lot more done.

222
00:11:20,677 --> 00:11:24,801
So as anyone who has taught an undergrad class in game design

223
00:11:24,861 --> 00:11:28,063
probably knows, having students play old games surely

224
00:11:28,103 --> 00:11:30,726
teaches them that old games are different and strange,

225
00:11:31,346 --> 00:11:33,047
but it doesn't necessarily explain to them

226
00:11:33,168 --> 00:11:34,268
why they are different.

227
00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:36,330
And so games themselves are actually

228
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:39,613
pretty silent on the tensions or forces that created them.

229
00:11:40,454 --> 00:11:44,037
And often, but when we talk about preserving video game history,

230
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:48,842
often we're interested in the elements that kind of loom largest in the history of the industry

231
00:11:48,882 --> 00:11:55,108
or they're most captivating to fans, right? The games themselves, raw code, post-mortems, specific assets.

232
00:11:56,449 --> 00:12:02,651
And historians, however, to get back to this point of values, have a larger social, cultural, and economic audit.

233
00:12:03,131 --> 00:12:09,994
And so they're interested in a kind of documentation that I suspect many in the industry would probably find inconsequential or totally banal.

234
00:12:10,714 --> 00:12:15,495
And so to illustrate this dilemma, I'm going to offer you something that I tend to call the tale of two CEOs.

235
00:12:16,475 --> 00:12:19,577
So in Rochester, New York, at the Strong Museum of Play,

236
00:12:19,957 --> 00:12:21,678
one of the premier game preservation museums

237
00:12:21,718 --> 00:12:23,339
and archives in the world, there are

238
00:12:23,359 --> 00:12:25,780
two very different collections of documents

239
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:26,940
I've been able to examine.

240
00:12:27,901 --> 00:12:30,462
And so first is the Ken and Roberta Williams collection,

241
00:12:30,562 --> 00:12:32,243
documenting the history of Sierra Online.

242
00:12:32,663 --> 00:12:34,544
And second is the Broderbund collection.

243
00:12:34,844 --> 00:12:38,326
Broderbund put out Choplift or Mist, print artists,

244
00:12:38,946 --> 00:12:41,307
right, a whole sort of, and that company

245
00:12:41,367 --> 00:12:44,288
was founded in this collection, donated by the company

246
00:12:44,329 --> 00:12:45,309
founder Doug Carlston.

247
00:12:46,284 --> 00:12:51,147
And so as a pair, these two companies actually have a lot of, are really good comparatively, right?

248
00:12:51,167 --> 00:12:54,989
They both begin in 1979, they start by making software for the Apple II,

249
00:12:55,669 --> 00:12:58,251
they both become titans of the early computer software world,

250
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:03,253
they survive economic shakeouts, they produce some of the most iconic software for the home computer,

251
00:13:03,473 --> 00:13:06,335
and they both kind of become defunct around the same time in the early 2000s.

252
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,312
But Ken Williams and Doug Carlston

253
00:13:10,392 --> 00:13:12,254
thought about their businesses and their histories

254
00:13:12,354 --> 00:13:12,814
differently.

255
00:13:13,175 --> 00:13:15,077
And that powerful distinction of personality

256
00:13:15,117 --> 00:13:17,759
is captured in their comparative archival collections.

257
00:13:19,058 --> 00:13:20,899
So the Ken and Roberta Williams collection

258
00:13:20,939 --> 00:13:23,781
is almost entirely comprised of front-of-the-house material

259
00:13:23,841 --> 00:13:24,641
and marketing items.

260
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:28,163
So copies of their consumer magazine, publicity headshots,

261
00:13:28,243 --> 00:13:30,624
newspaper clippings, annual reports, press releases,

262
00:13:31,045 --> 00:13:32,886
and also a lot of personal mementos.

263
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:35,947
So awards, gifts, framed fan letters.

264
00:13:36,588 --> 00:13:39,989
Ken Williams saved the nameplate from his door, which

265
00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:41,710
is very charming in some way.

266
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:49,380
Very little of this collection, however, is design documentation, and there is almost no internal documentation of any sort.

267
00:13:50,261 --> 00:13:53,386
It is silent to the subject of how games were made at Sierra.

268
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:57,311
So it's kind of an archive of a company's image, not of the company.

269
00:13:58,638 --> 00:13:59,899
And I would say that in contrast,

270
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:01,379
Doug Carlston's Broderbund collection

271
00:14:01,419 --> 00:14:03,581
is full of internal newsletters and memos,

272
00:14:03,961 --> 00:14:05,342
company profit and loss sheets,

273
00:14:05,422 --> 00:14:07,363
minutes of the board of directors, right?

274
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:08,764
Revised org charts,

275
00:14:08,824 --> 00:14:11,385
stuff that I imagine you would just want to throw away.

276
00:14:12,586 --> 00:14:14,627
Hundreds if not thousands of pieces of paper

277
00:14:14,667 --> 00:14:16,428
explaining how a company like Broderbund

278
00:14:16,628 --> 00:14:18,189
actually functioned behind its curtain.

279
00:14:18,849 --> 00:14:20,770
So Doug saved copies of his first checks.

280
00:14:21,071 --> 00:14:22,912
He carefully annotated his profits.

281
00:14:23,272 --> 00:14:28,135
He sent company employees to industry conferences and had them type up notes on panels, and

282
00:14:28,155 --> 00:14:32,217
they attended, and then he would file them and he saved them for 35 years, and then he

283
00:14:32,257 --> 00:14:33,358
donated them to the strong.

284
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:38,202
What Doug Carlston's meticulous, rich body of documents makes clear is something I've

285
00:14:38,342 --> 00:14:42,545
often found myself saying to industry workers, which is that the history of games is much

286
00:14:42,605 --> 00:14:43,926
larger than your games.

287
00:14:44,507 --> 00:14:49,070
And so this is disclosed within the Broderbund boxes and folders as, this is corporate history,

288
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,873
it's economic history, it's technological history, it's labor history.

289
00:14:52,553 --> 00:14:56,917
It gives us, better than any killer game or source code, a vision of what the world was

290
00:14:57,017 --> 00:14:59,579
like when the age of the personal computer dawned.

291
00:15:01,497 --> 00:15:04,819
And so I like to, sometimes I think of Ken Williams and Doug

292
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:07,381
Carlston as sort of the goofus and gallant of game history.

293
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:09,462
Which one, who do you want to be?

294
00:15:11,023 --> 00:15:12,724
And I think we can use this comparison

295
00:15:12,764 --> 00:15:15,646
to think broadly about what documentation actually

296
00:15:15,686 --> 00:15:16,567
documents.

297
00:15:17,347 --> 00:15:19,869
You could think, who can't be seen in your documentation?

298
00:15:19,949 --> 00:15:21,170
Whose work isn't visible?

299
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:24,172
Who's on your payroll who never makes it into your postmortem?

300
00:15:25,193 --> 00:15:27,374
A long time from now, reading those absences

301
00:15:27,514 --> 00:15:28,975
is actually what will tell historians

302
00:15:29,015 --> 00:15:30,697
more about your work and your culture

303
00:15:30,877 --> 00:15:32,498
than your games possibly will.

304
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:34,780
And you should also keep in mind

305
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,541
that historians are always gonna write more

306
00:15:36,641 --> 00:15:38,203
about the guy who had the better documents.

307
00:15:41,946 --> 00:15:43,507
So for most of human civilization,

308
00:15:43,547 --> 00:15:45,769
we've been able to discern information about the past

309
00:15:46,189 --> 00:15:48,931
because materials that humans used for documentation,

310
00:15:49,331 --> 00:15:51,133
stone, clay, vellum, and paper,

311
00:15:51,553 --> 00:15:53,034
were robust in their own way.

312
00:15:53,924 --> 00:15:57,845
So certainly stone can crumble, ink can fade, paper can burn,

313
00:15:57,865 --> 00:15:59,926
but for the most part, if kept at stable conditions

314
00:15:59,986 --> 00:16:02,727
and not subject to catastrophe, such documents

315
00:16:02,767 --> 00:16:04,908
are accessible insofar as they don't

316
00:16:04,948 --> 00:16:07,189
require any kind of special technology to access.

317
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:10,951
While many of these documents may be one of a kind,

318
00:16:11,651 --> 00:16:13,532
like the Bayeux tapestry I mentioned at the start,

319
00:16:13,832 --> 00:16:16,073
and therefore not able to be seen by everyone,

320
00:16:16,414 --> 00:16:19,155
the flip side of this is that the basic barrier of entry

321
00:16:19,195 --> 00:16:21,096
to the artifact itself is non-existent.

322
00:16:21,836 --> 00:16:24,018
You could think a stack of papers or photographs

323
00:16:24,058 --> 00:16:25,279
you find in your grandparents' attic

324
00:16:25,619 --> 00:16:27,921
can be as easily examined today as they could have

325
00:16:27,941 --> 00:16:29,382
been 75 or 100 years ago.

326
00:16:30,603 --> 00:16:33,004
But if we begin to think that game history is bigger

327
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:35,787
than our games, then we have to reckon

328
00:16:35,827 --> 00:16:37,508
with the phenomenal amount of material

329
00:16:37,548 --> 00:16:40,030
that we have made inaccessible to future generations

330
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,412
because we've needed it to be ultra accessible

331
00:16:42,472 --> 00:16:42,932
in the present.

332
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,571
So you can consider, for example,

333
00:16:45,611 --> 00:16:48,576
Steve Moretzky's phenomenal collection of Infocomm documents,

334
00:16:48,596 --> 00:16:50,820
which is housed in digital form on the Internet Archive.

335
00:16:51,221 --> 00:16:52,684
And this is part of a larger collection

336
00:16:52,704 --> 00:16:55,068
of Moretzky's personal papers that are stored at Stanford.

337
00:16:55,858 --> 00:16:59,279
In each bundle of papers, we find a phenomenal range of documents.

338
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:02,641
Design notes, fan letters, correspondence from other businesses,

339
00:17:03,161 --> 00:17:07,883
internal memoranda, client pitches, hand-edited documents, financial information. It's a trove.

340
00:17:08,563 --> 00:17:12,865
What makes a digital document like this possible is that all of these things were once just pieces

341
00:17:12,905 --> 00:17:16,226
of paper, right? That can be shuffled into a folder, easily stored, scanned.

342
00:17:17,147 --> 00:17:20,048
But today we use a different kind of proprietary software

343
00:17:20,108 --> 00:17:22,970
for nearly every type of communication we engage in.

344
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:26,211
Formats have splintered, becoming email, Slack, text,

345
00:17:26,331 --> 00:17:26,672
tweets.

346
00:17:27,372 --> 00:17:28,993
Internal correspondence with clients

347
00:17:29,053 --> 00:17:31,454
is locked behind God knows how many barriers of software.

348
00:17:31,874 --> 00:17:33,895
Collaborative documents are stored piled deep

349
00:17:33,935 --> 00:17:35,616
in your Dropboxes and your Google Drives,

350
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:38,177
often with no evidence of the changes and edits

351
00:17:38,237 --> 00:17:39,498
a document would have undergone.

352
00:17:40,118 --> 00:17:41,999
And so yes, theoretically, you can

353
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:44,721
find somewhere in your inbox every exchange you ever

354
00:17:44,781 --> 00:17:46,001
had about your last project.

355
00:17:46,503 --> 00:17:48,593
But when the archivist actually comes knocking,

356
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,985
what exactly are you going to hand over to them?

357
00:17:52,475 --> 00:17:55,197
And so the point here is not to stoke historical panic,

358
00:17:55,618 --> 00:17:57,840
although I can see that's maybe the downward slide where

359
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:00,062
this is going, but to kind of push

360
00:18:00,102 --> 00:18:02,284
us to rethink the affordances and limitations

361
00:18:02,324 --> 00:18:03,145
of digital formats.

362
00:18:03,965 --> 00:18:06,868
And I haven't even gotten to the problem of artifacts that

363
00:18:06,888 --> 00:18:08,770
are not easily understood in digital form,

364
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:11,052
like three-dimensional objects, or materials

365
00:18:11,092 --> 00:18:13,734
that have personally identifying or incriminating information

366
00:18:13,754 --> 00:18:16,257
that simply don't belong on the internet.

367
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:21,018
And so let me be clear, this is not a critique necessarily of the Internet Archive or other

368
00:18:21,158 --> 00:18:25,699
online game history initiatives per se. It's more so a critique of how we've permitted ourselves

369
00:18:25,739 --> 00:18:29,960
to rely on the Internet as an infrastructure, taking care of what is actually the responsibility

370
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,741
of the industry. And so it is a critique of the presumption that the real historical work can be

371
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:40,442
offloaded to anonymous, unpaid, or barely paid Internet laborers. And it is a critique certainly

372
00:18:40,482 --> 00:18:45,003
of the idea that digital equals saved and that everything belongs in the Internet just because

373
00:18:45,043 --> 00:18:45,583
it can be.

374
00:18:55,472 --> 00:19:00,414
Okay, so in 1984, several of the leading publishers of personal computer software

375
00:19:00,494 --> 00:19:03,856
banded together under the leadership of a man named Ken Walsh

376
00:19:04,997 --> 00:19:07,238
and formed the Software Publishers Association.

377
00:19:08,196 --> 00:19:10,257
Founding members included company representatives

378
00:19:10,277 --> 00:19:13,198
from businesses no less prestigious as Broderbund,

379
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,899
Infocomm, and CBS Software.

380
00:19:15,499 --> 00:19:17,440
They were authorized by no organization.

381
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:21,521
They granted self-rule by no institution.

382
00:19:22,082 --> 00:19:24,643
They were their own authorizing organization.

383
00:19:24,743 --> 00:19:27,204
They granted institutional rule unto themselves.

384
00:19:27,784 --> 00:19:30,065
Their aim was to protect their mutual interests

385
00:19:30,165 --> 00:19:30,865
as an industry.

386
00:19:31,285 --> 00:19:33,306
And chief among these for them at the time

387
00:19:33,386 --> 00:19:34,426
was the prevention of piracy.

388
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:40,289
They colluded with Compute Magazine to publish a two-page open letter to user group presidents

389
00:19:40,329 --> 00:19:45,539
and BBS SysOps, articulating the exact threat unofficial distribution of software meant

390
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:46,822
to their fledgling industry.

391
00:19:47,524 --> 00:19:51,507
And so as a historical document, this speaks to the efforts of entrepreneurs and businesses

392
00:19:51,847 --> 00:19:56,511
to identify what they understood as their industry's good, to make a case for its economic

393
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:59,753
health, and to establish the legal ramifications of copying.

394
00:20:00,454 --> 00:20:04,937
It is through such articulations that industries have become recognizable to themselves.

395
00:20:05,998 --> 00:20:08,681
And so I first learned about the SPA as a whisper, right,

396
00:20:08,721 --> 00:20:10,883
in a sheaf of documents tucked inside a folder

397
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:12,905
of Doug Carlston's Broderbund collection,

398
00:20:13,525 --> 00:20:15,007
which I mentioned just a bit earlier.

399
00:20:15,427 --> 00:20:17,389
So Carlston was one of the first industry leaders

400
00:20:17,429 --> 00:20:19,031
to sit on the SPA's board,

401
00:20:19,411 --> 00:20:21,213
and he had kept all of his correspondence

402
00:20:21,293 --> 00:20:23,755
with the SPA president, Ken Wash.

403
00:20:24,511 --> 00:20:26,932
And so letters from Walsh reveal that the SPAs

404
00:20:26,952 --> 00:20:29,414
were remarkably lo-fi tactics,

405
00:20:30,034 --> 00:20:32,756
in which Walsh himself would organize personal stings

406
00:20:32,816 --> 00:20:35,257
of software stores suspected of piracy.

407
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:39,280
In exchange for not turning businesses over to the Feds,

408
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:42,521
Walsh would demand a shakeout paid to the SBA, right?

409
00:20:43,122 --> 00:20:46,344
He was kind of like the software mafia, kind of.

410
00:20:47,825 --> 00:20:50,367
And so what the SPA understood was

411
00:20:50,387 --> 00:20:53,509
that expecting each company to individually fight piracy

412
00:20:53,549 --> 00:20:56,351
was a duplication of effort and a squandering of resources.

413
00:20:56,892 --> 00:20:58,713
And so when representatives of the industry

414
00:20:58,753 --> 00:21:00,674
determined that they wanted to fix a problem,

415
00:21:00,914 --> 00:21:01,895
they self-organized.

416
00:21:03,276 --> 00:21:05,378
And I bring up the SPA as a way to frame questions

417
00:21:05,438 --> 00:21:07,739
of collective action and self-definition

418
00:21:07,859 --> 00:21:09,421
within the context of an industry.

419
00:21:10,982 --> 00:21:12,363
So whose job is history?

420
00:21:13,088 --> 00:21:13,288
Right?

421
00:21:13,868 --> 00:21:15,870
Yours, but I mean that in two senses.

422
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:19,392
So first, on the scale of a collective,

423
00:21:19,912 --> 00:21:22,954
an industry's approach to its history reflects its self-regard

424
00:21:23,494 --> 00:21:26,396
and, in fact, its vision of its future, not just its past.

425
00:21:27,177 --> 00:21:29,938
But in the abdication of taking on that profound responsibility,

426
00:21:29,978 --> 00:21:31,920
the vacuum will fill with whatever's at hand.

427
00:21:32,841 --> 00:21:39,043
What might an organized historical vision have offered the protestations of ethics in game journalism?

428
00:21:39,563 --> 00:21:43,925
As if the bonds between industry media and industry production hadn't always been cozy?

429
00:21:44,445 --> 00:21:49,987
As if the industry wasn't always, since its inception, a close-knit, extremely exclusive group of peers?

430
00:21:50,527 --> 00:21:55,449
As if a certain pliancy in relations between journalism and industry producers hadn't actually

431
00:21:55,489 --> 00:22:00,831
been one of the qualities that allowed the game industry to survive, to grow in the face of a dubious public?

432
00:22:02,295 --> 00:22:03,597
So whose job is history?

433
00:22:04,297 --> 00:22:05,739
When I first proposed this talk, I

434
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:08,361
aspired to kind of rally you all behind the idea

435
00:22:08,401 --> 00:22:11,665
that somehow this was a problem we each as individuals

436
00:22:11,725 --> 00:22:13,947
could solve, that we could make some sort of game plan

437
00:22:13,987 --> 00:22:15,248
for a distributed archive.

438
00:22:16,089 --> 00:22:17,851
And while I do believe that the preservation

439
00:22:17,931 --> 00:22:19,612
and historicization of video games

440
00:22:19,973 --> 00:22:22,155
awaits everyone's contributions, I

441
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:24,497
have mellowed in my faith that action here

442
00:22:24,537 --> 00:22:26,139
belongs at the effort of the individual.

443
00:22:27,395 --> 00:22:29,456
So in something of a turn from my original thinking,

444
00:22:29,476 --> 00:22:33,158
I've tried to consider what video games could

445
00:22:33,198 --> 00:22:35,300
learn from older and more established industries.

446
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,721
And I thought, for guidance, video games,

447
00:22:37,801 --> 00:22:39,943
one of the defining media of the 21st century,

448
00:22:40,263 --> 00:22:43,345
might turn to the defining media of the 20th, which was film.

449
00:22:44,205 --> 00:22:46,047
And so the film industry has long understood

450
00:22:46,087 --> 00:22:48,508
that part of its heft comes from the drama of its past.

451
00:22:49,129 --> 00:22:51,851
But this is not a position driven by nostalgia alone.

452
00:22:51,911 --> 00:22:53,952
Historians of film have long been supported

453
00:22:53,992 --> 00:22:57,075
by an industry apparatus that not only values their work,

454
00:22:57,395 --> 00:22:59,276
but provides mechanisms to support it.

455
00:23:00,217 --> 00:23:03,299
So you need look no farther than the Academy Film Archive,

456
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:05,140
the Academy Oral History Projects,

457
00:23:05,401 --> 00:23:06,681
the Margaret Herrick Library,

458
00:23:07,142 --> 00:23:08,583
all part of the historical arm

459
00:23:08,643 --> 00:23:09,904
of the International Academy

460
00:23:09,944 --> 00:23:11,485
of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

461
00:23:12,326 --> 00:23:18,473
The Academy was founded in 1927, roughly 30 years after the earliest commercialization of cinema.

462
00:23:19,094 --> 00:23:23,760
It was only one year later that the Academy founded its library, which has sustained for

463
00:23:24,181 --> 00:23:27,365
90 years as the chief repository for materials related to this industry.

464
00:23:28,409 --> 00:23:29,810
So compared to the film industry,

465
00:23:30,211 --> 00:23:32,955
the game industry self-organized around its commercial interests

466
00:23:33,275 --> 00:23:35,338
faster, but it's more than 30 years

467
00:23:35,418 --> 00:23:37,822
behind in providing for its historical well-being.

468
00:23:37,882 --> 00:23:41,146
The game industry itself has no historical mandate, right?

469
00:23:41,206 --> 00:23:42,768
And that's kind of one of its problems.

470
00:23:43,369 --> 00:23:47,713
And so while the Academy of Motion Pictures may offer one of the most visible testaments

471
00:23:48,053 --> 00:23:51,817
to industry self-organization, there are comparable institutions, right?

472
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:56,941
The History of Computing has the Association of Computing Machinery and the IEEE.

473
00:23:57,242 --> 00:23:59,243
Chemistry has the Chemical Heritage Foundation.

474
00:23:59,544 --> 00:24:01,926
Graphic Design, the American Institute of Graphic Arts.

475
00:24:04,969 --> 00:24:09,813
There is no other serious professional industry on Earth that expects its history to be crowdsourced.

476
00:24:10,835 --> 00:24:14,637
In some sense, our enthusiasm to be an industry open to disruption,

477
00:24:14,957 --> 00:24:18,078
to take on wholeheartedly the possibilities of digital distribution,

478
00:24:18,478 --> 00:24:20,859
crowdfunding, mobile gaming, long-tail economics,

479
00:24:21,339 --> 00:24:24,700
have not served us well in solving our industry's preservation

480
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,221
and historical literacy problems.

481
00:24:26,881 --> 00:24:30,062
We have followed a model of displacing institutional agency

482
00:24:30,162 --> 00:24:32,663
in the same way we rely on distributed consumer networks.

483
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:35,364
And so this will not work for history.

484
00:24:36,104 --> 00:24:38,145
So if we believe that this industry is here to stay,

485
00:24:38,305 --> 00:24:39,866
we have to punch up, I think.

486
00:24:40,686 --> 00:24:45,131
and sort of push on representatives of the game industry's organizing bodies and leading publishers

487
00:24:45,352 --> 00:24:48,035
to fund the organization of historical preservation.

488
00:24:49,056 --> 00:24:51,779
Which is not to say that we have nothing to do in the meantime.

489
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:56,805
And if you want my low-res solution for the historical memory problem of our present,

490
00:24:57,886 --> 00:24:59,268
I would say put your crap in a box.

491
00:24:59,969 --> 00:25:00,129
So...

492
00:25:01,336 --> 00:25:10,560
Which is like any, if I have in every single instance in which I have been able to acquire historical documents from people who worked in the industry in the 80s and 90s,

493
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:15,982
it is because they have some box somewhere in their house that they pull off and they just hand me, right?

494
00:25:16,082 --> 00:25:17,943
That it actually exists in a physical form.

495
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:19,164
They don't have to search for it.

496
00:25:20,264 --> 00:25:22,705
You know, there's no combing through digital documents to find it.

497
00:25:23,634 --> 00:25:25,316
This is a sincere suggestion, right?

498
00:25:25,336 --> 00:25:26,897
You could buy a box and you could put stuff in it.

499
00:25:27,498 --> 00:25:29,299
So it's not glamorous and it's not heroic,

500
00:25:29,339 --> 00:25:30,861
but it's really damn effective.

501
00:25:31,361 --> 00:25:32,902
And you keep a box under your desk

502
00:25:32,962 --> 00:25:34,224
and you could put stuff in it, right?

503
00:25:34,244 --> 00:25:35,865
You can imagine this as a work process

504
00:25:35,905 --> 00:25:37,466
if this is something that you're into, right?

505
00:25:37,506 --> 00:25:38,647
So what's your thing, right?

506
00:25:38,708 --> 00:25:40,509
Kickstarter, teaching, budgets, art,

507
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:42,951
design documents, game reviews, right?

508
00:25:43,272 --> 00:25:44,813
You could print it out and you could put it in a box.

509
00:25:45,648 --> 00:25:47,230
And it works for other digital stuff too.

510
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:50,015
So you could gather up screenshots, web clippings,

511
00:25:50,095 --> 00:25:53,220
code dumps, storifies, my God, your photos, right?

512
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:56,565
I would kill for your photos in 75 years when I'm dead.

513
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:04,116
Like organize them into folders, drop them on a USB drive or a hard drive and put them in a box.

514
00:26:04,756 --> 00:26:09,517
And so the idea here is that saving does not have to be perfect, right? It just has to be enough.

515
00:26:10,197 --> 00:26:14,858
Documentation is never a one-to-one representation of your experience, right? It's a gesture.

516
00:26:15,478 --> 00:26:20,740
And so saving is like this act of trust that a future soul will be able to read that gesture.

517
00:26:21,836 --> 00:26:25,279
And the reason I tell you to put it in a box is because we need to get this stuff into

518
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:29,242
formats that are accessible off the internet, that aren't trapped behind passwords that

519
00:26:29,262 --> 00:26:30,683
don't require special software.

520
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:35,827
And also boxes are great for programs, name tags, swag, doodles, ticket stubs, autographs,

521
00:26:37,088 --> 00:26:40,550
you know, your program from GDC, as well as awards.

522
00:26:41,171 --> 00:26:44,874
If you're not supposed to keep this stuff due to a company NDA, I would guess your company

523
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:49,177
probably won't be around in 100 years anyway, so, you know, I'm not worried about it.

524
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:54,152
If you work at a company and would like to think about how,

525
00:26:54,292 --> 00:26:56,953
just even just to go through the thought experiment

526
00:26:56,993 --> 00:26:59,254
of like, how would you address this systemically?

527
00:26:59,294 --> 00:27:01,015
This is a conversation you could have, right?

528
00:27:01,035 --> 00:27:02,095
With someone at your company.

529
00:27:02,416 --> 00:27:03,456
Do you own a company?

530
00:27:03,596 --> 00:27:05,237
Maybe we could talk about this, right?

531
00:27:05,477 --> 00:27:07,217
We could figure out something to do.

532
00:27:08,238 --> 00:27:10,879
But remember that this is a tactic, not a solution.

533
00:27:11,239 --> 00:27:14,040
If we want, in the long run, something better than a box,

534
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,980
and certainly better than a history we can't access,

535
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,141
we might want to think about punching up.

536
00:27:19,741 --> 00:27:23,342
And what is the best industry organization to do this?

537
00:27:23,662 --> 00:27:24,683
Who do we need to talk to?

538
00:27:24,883 --> 00:27:26,763
I don't actually know, which is why I'm here,

539
00:27:27,063 --> 00:27:28,604
because I would like to think that we could all

540
00:27:28,644 --> 00:27:29,284
do this together.

541
00:27:29,304 --> 00:27:30,164
Thank you.

542
00:27:37,772 --> 00:27:46,016
Thank you, Richard.

543
00:27:46,036 --> 00:27:47,176
Thank you.

544
00:27:47,196 --> 00:27:47,436
Thank you.

545
00:27:47,456 --> 00:27:47,697
All right.

546
00:27:47,737 --> 00:27:48,877
How are we on time?

547
00:27:51,018 --> 00:27:51,938
I have no idea what time it is.

548
00:27:52,899 --> 00:27:53,539
I have a lot of time?

549
00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:55,420
Oh, yeah.

550
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,500
Yeah, it's almost 11 30.

551
00:27:56,681 --> 00:27:57,301
Oh, one minute.

552
00:27:57,381 --> 00:27:57,641
OK.

553
00:27:57,681 --> 00:27:58,681
We're gobs of time.

554
00:27:58,921 --> 00:27:59,042
OK.

555
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:01,840
Sure, yeah, please.

556
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,121
Oh, OK.

557
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:06,824
I have a question specifically about preserving

558
00:28:06,844 --> 00:28:13,769
online experiences, things like server code, things like just

559
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:17,352
even the experience of playing online with a bunch of other

560
00:28:17,392 --> 00:28:17,772
people.

561
00:28:18,493 --> 00:28:21,836
How might we go about preserving that, or what

562
00:28:21,896 --> 00:28:25,418
initiatives might be the best for preserving

563
00:28:25,478 --> 00:28:26,199
those kinds of things?

564
00:28:26,922 --> 00:28:31,226
Yeah, that's a real, I mean, so it's the Library of,

565
00:28:31,386 --> 00:28:33,508
I feel like Jeremy should get up here and answer this question.

566
00:28:34,969 --> 00:28:37,131
It's the, the Library of Congress is

567
00:28:37,291 --> 00:28:39,533
preserving virtual worlds initiative has

568
00:28:39,693 --> 00:28:40,794
released several white papers

569
00:28:40,934 --> 00:28:42,496
trying to figure out this problem.

570
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:43,837
I think the general consensus is.

571
00:28:44,657 --> 00:28:45,777
we don't really know.

572
00:28:45,797 --> 00:28:51,258
And I'm not versed enough specifically in virtual worlds,

573
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:53,079
although I could probably like point you

574
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:54,799
to some people who know more about that.

575
00:28:55,139 --> 00:28:58,140
I tend to be more kind of behind the back of the house,

576
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:58,480
right?

577
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,500
I'm trying to figure out like

578
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,700
who was doing the server updates

579
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,461
and that's the person I'm trying to get information from.

580
00:29:04,441 --> 00:29:05,121
This is one of the,

581
00:29:05,181 --> 00:29:06,821
like the culture that exists in these worlds

582
00:29:06,861 --> 00:29:07,381
is like one of,

583
00:29:07,822 --> 00:29:10,422
is also a critical historical problem that, right?

584
00:29:11,443 --> 00:29:14,876
I think many other media are kind of struggling to figure out how to deal with.

585
00:29:15,096 --> 00:29:16,080
It's a point well taken.

586
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:22,405
That was one of the questions I wanted to ask and comment

587
00:29:22,445 --> 00:29:25,325
about, because the Internet Archive has started archiving

588
00:29:25,885 --> 00:29:28,186
completely runnable emulators for a lot of game

589
00:29:28,406 --> 00:29:30,466
architectures that you can't even buy anymore.

590
00:29:31,946 --> 00:29:34,147
So that might be an institution, because they're

591
00:29:34,167 --> 00:29:36,387
here, and they have a big, beautiful, church-like

592
00:29:36,427 --> 00:29:39,208
building, that I've talked to them and other people have

593
00:29:39,228 --> 00:29:39,608
talked to them.

594
00:29:39,628 --> 00:29:41,848
And I didn't know about the Library of Congress, but maybe

595
00:29:41,908 --> 00:29:43,729
somewhere between the Library of Congress, which might move

596
00:29:43,769 --> 00:29:46,049
a bit slowly, and the Archive, which is a bunch of hackers.

597
00:29:46,749 --> 00:29:51,575
we could get some first online worlds where the servers get donated and not turned off at the end?

598
00:29:51,995 --> 00:29:52,235
Yeah.

599
00:29:52,676 --> 00:29:55,819
Um, and my, but you already kind of addressed that.

600
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:02,667
My other question is, um, so I've been engaged with other game developers, you know, in this community.

601
00:30:03,347 --> 00:30:07,831
But you only see each other at GDC so often and there's the GDC vault. But recently I started doing twitch

602
00:30:09,031 --> 00:30:15,516
Twitch deletes video on demand like recordings of the developers work just by default because you have to like pay extra to keep it

603
00:30:15,696 --> 00:30:15,816
Yeah

604
00:30:15,836 --> 00:30:21,660
So I made a hundred dollar donation to memories of a broken dimension to the developer extra because he's like a shader sorcerer said buy

605
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:26,624
A hard drive save the files like stuff you're teaching and like doing on your stream is historic

606
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:34,056
Could we do something like that to kind of institutionalize or fund the saving of people who do stream or record their work?

607
00:30:35,798 --> 00:30:39,121
So I'll address these questions in two parts. One, I think a lot of people...

608
00:30:39,141 --> 00:30:44,466
I would go on a limb and say that I'm like decent buddies with Jason Scott, who is the kind of guy

609
00:30:44,506 --> 00:30:47,469
responsible for a lot of the video game preservation on the Internet Archive.

610
00:30:47,509 --> 00:30:51,773
And I think a lot of people aren't aware that like that work is like him.

611
00:30:52,574 --> 00:30:54,016
and him alone, right?

612
00:30:54,056 --> 00:30:56,119
Like there is like one madman in a top hat

613
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:57,401
who is capable of doing this.

614
00:30:57,521 --> 00:31:00,485
And that is actually not like for me a sustainable solution.

615
00:31:01,707 --> 00:31:02,689
I think that we have a,

616
00:31:02,929 --> 00:31:06,334
I mean, the man just had a heart attack.

617
00:31:06,374 --> 00:31:07,595
He's like currently recovering.

618
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:15,853
whenever your preservation comes down to like the phenomenal

619
00:31:16,053 --> 00:31:18,316
and I would say like hugely in many ways,

620
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:19,997
uncompensated labor of an individual,

621
00:31:20,077 --> 00:31:22,420
that is not actually a solution, right?

622
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,262
And so this is why I argue that.

623
00:31:25,207 --> 00:31:27,408
And I would similarly say to the Twitch problem, right?

624
00:31:27,448 --> 00:31:29,429
One of my arguments is that we have

625
00:31:29,449 --> 00:31:31,930
to get out of a crowdsourcing mentality, right?

626
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:36,151
And figure out, or that can work as a small-scale tactic

627
00:31:36,211 --> 00:31:39,552
in the immediate, but there has to be a larger conversation.

628
00:31:39,692 --> 00:31:41,613
And GDC seemed like the most appropriate place

629
00:31:41,653 --> 00:31:43,493
to take that question, right?

630
00:31:43,553 --> 00:31:45,254
Is that someone needs to be funding this,

631
00:31:45,294 --> 00:31:46,775
and it actually needs to not be us.

632
00:31:47,615 --> 00:31:49,936
It's kind of not our individual responsibility.

633
00:31:50,917 --> 00:31:55,420
I think that the industry could take a stronger role in this,

634
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,541
in the way that we've seen with many other entertainment

635
00:31:58,561 --> 00:31:59,522
and technology industries.

636
00:32:03,985 --> 00:32:05,686
Forgive me if you already addressed this.

637
00:32:05,726 --> 00:32:06,766
I walked into the panel late.

638
00:32:10,308 --> 00:32:11,989
What is your view?

639
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:14,051
I know this is a very broad subject.

640
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:20,864
for preservation of work where the original holders, original creators, no longer exist,

641
00:32:20,964 --> 00:32:23,646
entities have been dissolved, rights can't be determined,

642
00:32:24,106 --> 00:32:27,869
and oftentimes issues of great time importance

643
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:30,191
because they're on hardware that's old and failing.

644
00:32:30,231 --> 00:32:33,034
I've done a lot of preservation of old and failing hardware myself,

645
00:32:33,114 --> 00:32:37,557
and there's this kind of legal versus moral quandary that you run into.

646
00:32:38,098 --> 00:32:40,740
What is your analysis on that?

647
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,520
What are my thoughts?

648
00:32:43,171 --> 00:32:45,393
I mean, I do tend to take a,

649
00:32:45,893 --> 00:32:47,574
I think I tend to be in agreement with Jason

650
00:32:47,594 --> 00:32:50,076
that you say first and ask permission later.

651
00:32:51,998 --> 00:32:53,118
And I mean, that's,

652
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:59,063
I'm not super susceptible to the legal quandary

653
00:32:59,103 --> 00:33:01,785
unless someone is actually able to enforce it, right?

654
00:33:01,805 --> 00:33:05,168
I mean, this is, I think, one of the reasons it's,

655
00:33:06,669 --> 00:33:08,770
the game industry is equal parts

656
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:10,131
entertainment and technology.

657
00:33:11,212 --> 00:33:14,173
And so it has that, the technology part of it

658
00:33:14,253 --> 00:33:16,093
is the part that can't answer these questions, right?

659
00:33:16,113 --> 00:33:18,794
The tech industry is also terrible at this, right?

660
00:33:18,894 --> 00:33:20,814
They don't really have this sorted out either.

661
00:33:21,215 --> 00:33:23,735
And it's that component of, I think, games

662
00:33:23,815 --> 00:33:26,316
that has been slow to move on precisely

663
00:33:26,356 --> 00:33:27,296
these kinds of problems.

664
00:33:27,616 --> 00:33:28,877
Whereas I think institutions like film

665
00:33:28,917 --> 00:33:31,297
have adopted a somewhat mellower attitude

666
00:33:31,337 --> 00:33:35,058
about kind of reproduction rights and these kinds of things.

667
00:33:36,339 --> 00:33:37,199
Thank you. Sure.

668
00:33:37,959 --> 00:33:39,279
So I know we're out of time, but.

669
00:33:40,582 --> 00:33:46,745
So someone who's been around a long time and has been part of companies like Sierra and Interplay and Virgin who to your point

670
00:33:46,965 --> 00:33:49,126
We didn't do a good job of historically keeping things

671
00:33:51,607 --> 00:33:55,608
While I appreciate what you're saying and your note of coming here to try and do that

672
00:33:56,209 --> 00:33:59,450
You're also in a room full of people saying crowdsource is not the solution

673
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:06,653
And I am friends with Civality and others and have quite a collection myself both from past companies and just games history

674
00:34:08,918 --> 00:34:13,125
Are the people who are actively trying to be historians, the Sephardi, the Jasons,

675
00:34:13,265 --> 00:34:19,013
yourself, are you guys, who's the Mike Walsh of that that's trying to get you guys together

676
00:34:19,094 --> 00:34:19,374
to drive a

677
00:34:21,339 --> 00:34:23,221
deeper and bigger conversation.

678
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:26,804
I don't think there is one yet, which is what I wanted this.

679
00:34:26,884 --> 00:34:28,365
And so, yeah, I'm aware of, like,

680
00:34:28,405 --> 00:34:30,647
Frank literally just launched this two days ago.

681
00:34:30,687 --> 00:34:32,909
And I was like, this is an interesting counterpoint

682
00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:35,951
to some of the, I think, the argument I want to make

683
00:34:36,552 --> 00:34:38,894
is that we don't have one yet, right?

684
00:34:39,054 --> 00:34:42,477
And I would like to imagine a banding together.

685
00:34:42,637 --> 00:34:46,260
And I mean, Ken Walsh is an interesting story.

686
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,821
And I don't know what motivated him

687
00:34:48,001 --> 00:34:49,423
to want to operate in that way.

688
00:34:51,377 --> 00:35:04,122
But yeah, yeah, I mean, that in some sense, like, that's what I'm saying, right, is that some, if we could shift the way we think about this as a problem, we might start to come up with different solutions.

689
00:35:04,562 --> 00:35:08,224
And I think that is one of the possible solutions, right?

690
00:35:10,805 --> 00:35:10,965
Sure.

691
00:35:14,527 --> 00:35:15,167
Anybody else?

692
00:35:15,207 --> 00:35:15,968
Are we over time?

693
00:35:16,108 --> 00:35:16,628
I think we're.

694
00:35:20,129 --> 00:35:20,530
Sorry, man.
