1
00:00:05,414 --> 00:00:12,899
I'm Yves Jacquier. I'm heading the production services studios at Ubisoft in Montreal and in

2
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:18,764
particular Ubisoft La Forge which is our R&D department and in which the different prototypes

3
00:00:18,904 --> 00:00:23,248
that I will show have been created by a very talented multidisciplinary team.

4
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:31,094
Thank you. So unless you've been intentionally not following the news

5
00:00:31,154 --> 00:00:33,896
last year you have heard about AI.

6
00:00:36,029 --> 00:00:39,410
But the word AI means many things.

7
00:00:41,051 --> 00:00:43,412
Generally, we use it in place of NPCs.

8
00:00:43,572 --> 00:00:46,293
So it's worth setting some vocabulary here.

9
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:51,034
AI represents the concepts of machines

10
00:00:51,475 --> 00:00:55,036
that can learn, reason, and act for themselves.

11
00:00:56,876 --> 00:00:58,877
Machine learning is a subset of AI.

12
00:00:58,897 --> 00:01:01,118
There are programs using statistics

13
00:01:01,878 --> 00:01:04,199
to find patterns in massive amount of data.

14
00:01:04,847 --> 00:01:08,290
and use those patterns to make predictions on new data.

15
00:01:10,892 --> 00:01:14,574
Deep learning can be seen as machine learning on steroids.

16
00:01:16,075 --> 00:01:20,899
It extracts layered features, or learned from complex data,

17
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,141
in order to make a prediction.

18
00:01:24,061 --> 00:01:27,484
And because it analyzes the data through many hidden layers,

19
00:01:27,944 --> 00:01:29,565
it is called deep learning.

20
00:01:29,585 --> 00:01:33,088
Don't worry, I will explain more in detail what it means later.

21
00:01:35,882 --> 00:01:38,684
People often refer to AI disruption.

22
00:01:38,884 --> 00:01:41,786
In reality, the most recent developments

23
00:01:42,306 --> 00:01:43,808
deal with deep learning.

24
00:01:45,749 --> 00:01:49,652
The hype of deep learning is at its maximum.

25
00:01:50,072 --> 00:01:51,613
And because it's still exploratory,

26
00:01:52,194 --> 00:01:55,997
we live a time of excessive expectations followed

27
00:01:56,497 --> 00:01:58,098
by excessive disappointments.

28
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,141
So what I hope to accomplish today

29
00:02:03,042 --> 00:02:05,544
is to provide with a more concrete view.

30
00:02:06,245 --> 00:02:10,827
of what machine learning really is, can, and can't do.

31
00:02:11,687 --> 00:02:16,329
And most importantly, how to include it in our production process.

32
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:25,413
I will first show a handful of examples to explain why it has the potential to shake the way we work.

33
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:30,055
I will also try to briefly explain what it really is.

34
00:02:31,031 --> 00:02:35,272
and why it requires to rethink many parts of our production,

35
00:02:35,532 --> 00:02:40,394
which is why it's not only a technical aspect

36
00:02:40,554 --> 00:02:43,135
that needs to be considered when talking about machine learning.

37
00:02:44,776 --> 00:02:50,417
Then I'll try to assess the maturity and pace of machine learning applications

38
00:02:50,477 --> 00:02:54,399
and finally we'll explain how Ubisoft decided to lead the change.

39
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:57,320
The first part of my

40
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:06,575
presentation is powered with examples of prototypes that have not shipped yet in an announced

41
00:03:06,655 --> 00:03:12,096
game. And the second part of my presentation will show concrete examples that have been

42
00:03:12,236 --> 00:03:22,278
applied to real productions from last year. So let's start. How disruptive is AI? We've

43
00:03:22,298 --> 00:03:24,178
been making video games for decades.

44
00:03:24,812 --> 00:03:32,638
And AI has been at its core, whether to shape the players' interactions or in our production processes.

45
00:03:32,858 --> 00:03:34,799
So why are we here to discuss about AI?

46
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:41,424
Why is it considered as something new or disruptive for many domains, including our industry?

47
00:03:42,345 --> 00:03:43,246
Let's start with a hint.

48
00:03:44,487 --> 00:03:49,330
This is how we made the cinematics in Assassin's Creed Origins two years ago.

49
00:03:50,471 --> 00:03:53,854
Come here! I found a hyena cave! A real one, yeah!

50
00:03:54,653 --> 00:03:55,273
Ah, go ahead.

51
00:03:56,354 --> 00:03:58,156
You're gonna love it. There's like 16 of them.

52
00:03:58,236 --> 00:03:59,937
And it's so dark and scary.

53
00:03:59,957 --> 00:04:04,981
Well, you know what? I'd rather go home with my papa.

54
00:04:05,681 --> 00:04:07,263
You always get too scared.

55
00:04:08,063 --> 00:04:08,344
Hey.

56
00:04:14,328 --> 00:04:15,669
Let's go on a real hunt.

57
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:16,590
Huh?

58
00:04:17,911 --> 00:04:18,251
Alright.

59
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:18,632
Come, come.

60
00:04:21,313 --> 00:04:26,556
So as you can see, this requires capturing a lot of data and many people from many different crafts.

61
00:04:27,277 --> 00:04:31,959
Logistic of such traditional methods is expensive and not flexible.

62
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:39,063
Think about that, for example, each retake requires a lot of efforts and mobilization from many different people.

63
00:04:39,223 --> 00:04:44,926
So can AI have a concrete impact that shakes the foundation of our pipelines?

64
00:04:46,206 --> 00:04:50,488
Let's ask to someone who has been heavily impacted by AI last year.

65
00:04:51,503 --> 00:04:54,645
Bayek, can you explain to us how disruptive AI is?

66
00:04:57,347 --> 00:04:58,067
Hello, everyone.

67
00:04:58,828 --> 00:05:00,629
Creating in-game cinematics requires

68
00:05:00,729 --> 00:05:04,371
many skilled professionals, such as motion capture, animation,

69
00:05:04,851 --> 00:05:05,892
and dialogue experts.

70
00:05:06,893 --> 00:05:08,394
One year ago, it would have involved

71
00:05:08,434 --> 00:05:11,156
hours of manual work to record and animate this dialogue.

72
00:05:12,116 --> 00:05:14,878
Now, what if I told you that everything about me

73
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,799
is driven by artificial intelligence?

74
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,402
My voice has been generated from a simple text file.

75
00:05:21,146 --> 00:05:23,046
which then drives my lips animation.

76
00:05:23,987 --> 00:05:26,687
It's totally automatic, takes just a few minutes,

77
00:05:27,267 --> 00:05:28,828
and soon will work in real time.

78
00:05:29,468 --> 00:05:32,109
And the best thing, it works in any language.

79
00:05:32,929 --> 00:05:36,810
Par exemple, je parle le français avec un accent canadien.

80
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,910
I'm not sure what the limits are,

81
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,591
but it gives you an idea of the incoming magnitude

82
00:05:41,631 --> 00:05:44,432
of changes for many professions involved in video games,

83
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:46,772
such as animation and dialogue experts.

84
00:05:50,312 --> 00:05:55,995
Another example, Assassin's Creed is a franchise recognized for the quality of its open worlds,

85
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:59,157
and in such games, diversity is key.

86
00:06:00,338 --> 00:06:05,320
However, the size and the richness of a world leads to some technical trade-offs.

87
00:06:05,481 --> 00:06:11,944
As an example, you can see here that the characters feel a bit on a rail, if you pay attention.

88
00:06:14,882 --> 00:06:19,424
Is there a way to create more diverse and organic animations

89
00:06:19,784 --> 00:06:21,725
while simplifying the production process?

90
00:06:22,825 --> 00:06:25,746
What if instead of creating animation data offline,

91
00:06:26,566 --> 00:06:30,108
we were able to generate motion on the fly based

92
00:06:30,588 --> 00:06:31,708
on some high-level context?

93
00:06:34,549 --> 00:06:37,510
This is an example of data-driven animation,

94
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:42,512
or in other words, a system that generates the right motion

95
00:06:42,552 --> 00:06:43,072
animation.

96
00:06:44,265 --> 00:06:48,267
It works in real time, and instead of creating animation,

97
00:06:48,327 --> 00:06:51,189
clips, and rules to play them, the AI

98
00:06:51,249 --> 00:06:54,270
decides what to play amongst all the data.

99
00:06:55,071 --> 00:06:58,693
So not only does it require less production effort,

100
00:06:59,773 --> 00:07:03,135
it will also offer a more appealing feel for the player.

101
00:07:04,996 --> 00:07:07,938
In the next example, still from Assassin's Creed Origins,

102
00:07:08,338 --> 00:07:12,080
please pay attention to the characters who want to sit down.

103
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:21,875
The transitions between different animation systems,

104
00:07:21,955 --> 00:07:25,057
like motions and stations, are difficult to manage,

105
00:07:25,597 --> 00:07:29,040
and it leads to animations that feel not really natural.

106
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:34,003
We usually blend clips that were captured with mocap.

107
00:07:34,984 --> 00:07:37,766
So what if we did not have to switch

108
00:07:38,266 --> 00:07:41,048
between animation systems and generate transitions?

109
00:07:44,451 --> 00:07:45,531
In this example,

110
00:07:46,472 --> 00:07:47,613
the same system.

111
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:51,470
just the same as before, generates

112
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:56,712
more believable animations in any context and in real time.

113
00:08:03,835 --> 00:08:05,756
We have a lot of fun with our characters.

114
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:11,078
So what is machine learning?

115
00:08:12,167 --> 00:08:17,028
The part of artificial intelligence that has recently evolved exponentially is called machine

116
00:08:17,068 --> 00:08:17,389
learning.

117
00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:20,810
I will try to explain here the core concepts of machine learning.

118
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:26,392
There's nothing technical here, but it is important to understand the data-driven application

119
00:08:26,612 --> 00:08:32,874
and approach of machine learning because it's key in the change we have to lead in production.

120
00:08:34,255 --> 00:08:38,376
Just raising hand, how many of you are already familiar with those concepts?

121
00:08:40,497 --> 00:08:40,697
Okay.

122
00:08:42,227 --> 00:08:47,349
So half of you will have to bear with some simplification

123
00:08:47,389 --> 00:08:49,650
that we'll have to make to explain

124
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,711
what machine learning is.

125
00:08:51,271 --> 00:08:54,252
But I think it's important that we are all on the same page.

126
00:08:55,193 --> 00:08:57,674
Here is a simple prediction problem.

127
00:08:58,874 --> 00:09:00,935
If I'm asking you the value of f,

128
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:08,398
your brain will analyze the data, decompose it,

129
00:09:09,379 --> 00:09:10,099
and generalize.

130
00:09:10,804 --> 00:09:13,925
an approximation, this is a generalization step.

131
00:09:14,685 --> 00:09:18,265
And then extrapolate, which is a prediction step.

132
00:09:19,986 --> 00:09:22,766
This very simple example illustrates two key concepts.

133
00:09:22,946 --> 00:09:28,707
First, the principle of a given data set that illustrates a desired behavior.

134
00:09:30,308 --> 00:09:39,429
And a learning algorithm that uses this data set to create a function that enables generalization

135
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:40,510
to new inputs.

136
00:09:41,843 --> 00:09:43,504
And this is what machine learning does.

137
00:09:44,485 --> 00:09:47,026
But we use it for a problem a bit more complex

138
00:09:47,106 --> 00:09:48,787
than drawing a straight line.

139
00:09:49,767 --> 00:09:51,548
It uses three dangerous ingredients.

140
00:09:51,928 --> 00:09:55,010
First, a data set that represents the desired outcome.

141
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:59,772
A neural network, which is a transformation function,

142
00:10:00,072 --> 00:10:01,973
basically a set of matrices.

143
00:10:03,233 --> 00:10:05,254
And also learning algorithms that

144
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:07,755
parameterizes the transformation function,

145
00:10:08,116 --> 00:10:09,957
basically fill the matrices.

146
00:10:12,091 --> 00:10:17,034
So the data set is used as a set of input and output examples

147
00:10:17,494 --> 00:10:18,555
for a neural network.

148
00:10:19,896 --> 00:10:22,397
The algorithms measure the difference

149
00:10:22,838 --> 00:10:26,860
between the network output and the desired output,

150
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,061
or in other words, what we call the ground truth.

151
00:10:30,042 --> 00:10:32,484
The process is obviously iterative in a loop

152
00:10:32,604 --> 00:10:36,026
that is called the training phase that can last hours,

153
00:10:36,086 --> 00:10:37,166
days, or even weeks.

154
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:42,008
And based on those examples, it sets the weights of neurons,

155
00:10:42,168 --> 00:10:44,690
which means filling matrices, or in other words,

156
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:46,891
parameterizes the neural network.

157
00:10:47,712 --> 00:10:51,475
Somewhat, the machine learns based on examples.

158
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:55,278
The neural network is then ready to generalize

159
00:10:55,438 --> 00:10:56,439
as a predictive model.

160
00:10:56,499 --> 00:10:59,941
So a new input provides an output.

161
00:11:00,862 --> 00:11:04,785
But because machine learning approximates the ground truth

162
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:06,866
based on its observation.

163
00:11:08,133 --> 00:11:10,314
The output always comes with stats,

164
00:11:10,655 --> 00:11:15,198
like precision, confidence, recall, and et cetera.

165
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,302
It is also important to note that simple data

166
00:11:20,382 --> 00:11:23,624
sets for simple input treatments have been used for decades.

167
00:11:24,485 --> 00:11:27,907
For example, for handwritten characters recognitions.

168
00:11:28,447 --> 00:11:32,670
So what if we use complex data, like images or sounds,

169
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:34,992
or even what is apparently the biggest

170
00:11:35,052 --> 00:11:36,693
challenge on the internet, which is?

171
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,501
which is recognizing pictures of cats.

172
00:11:42,641 --> 00:11:43,561
The principle is the same,

173
00:11:44,342 --> 00:11:46,482
but the models to extract features

174
00:11:46,862 --> 00:11:48,243
or generalize is different.

175
00:11:49,883 --> 00:11:52,744
The key idea is to decompose complex data

176
00:11:53,044 --> 00:11:55,004
into smaller manageable features.

177
00:11:55,085 --> 00:11:57,265
And because there are many hidden layers,

178
00:11:57,825 --> 00:11:59,186
it is called deep learning.

179
00:12:00,906 --> 00:12:04,467
What is interesting though is that the mathematical methods

180
00:12:04,947 --> 00:12:06,928
behind deep learning are not new.

181
00:12:07,823 --> 00:12:14,306
However, the first applicable results of deep learning, real applicable results, happened

182
00:12:14,607 --> 00:12:14,747
in 2010.

183
00:12:15,927 --> 00:12:18,929
The missing link was computing power.

184
00:12:21,891 --> 00:12:23,131
It works exactly the same way.

185
00:12:24,192 --> 00:12:31,756
The algorithm extracts features from the data and then populates different layers of neurons.

186
00:12:32,396 --> 00:12:36,258
Each layer represents a step in the feature extraction.

187
00:12:37,638 --> 00:12:40,199
When the neural network sees a new picture,

188
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,922
it predicts whether the image is a cat or not

189
00:12:44,902 --> 00:12:47,724
by extracting the features from the input data.

190
00:12:51,647 --> 00:12:55,709
Simple data sets require simple machine learning problems

191
00:12:55,889 --> 00:12:56,410
and models.

192
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:01,233
Complex data sets require more complex algorithms

193
00:13:01,593 --> 00:13:05,295
to populate hidden layers that serves as feature extraction.

194
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:10,142
And this is why we say it is data-driven.

195
00:13:11,723 --> 00:13:16,004
Instead of implementing a specific outcome or behavior,

196
00:13:16,584 --> 00:13:21,245
if this, then that, we focus on the right data

197
00:13:21,305 --> 00:13:23,446
set that represents this behavior.

198
00:13:24,786 --> 00:13:26,907
And because machine learning always

199
00:13:27,027 --> 00:13:29,867
makes a prediction when new data is shown,

200
00:13:30,488 --> 00:13:33,288
it is extremely important that the data set reflects

201
00:13:33,588 --> 00:13:36,029
the future usage of your network.

202
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,002
or it will lead to very unexpected results.

203
00:13:40,463 --> 00:13:45,087
If the neural network learns from pictures of ducks and beavers,

204
00:13:47,249 --> 00:13:53,434
showing a platypus, believe me, will lead to interesting but likely unexpected results.

205
00:13:57,917 --> 00:14:00,099
Now, why is it important?

206
00:14:00,821 --> 00:14:05,283
Because as game developers, we have many types of interesting complex data,

207
00:14:05,323 --> 00:14:08,204
like sound, animation, textures, models,

208
00:14:08,904 --> 00:14:12,806
which means we have a lot of data that is relevant for deep learning,

209
00:14:13,526 --> 00:14:16,428
and many possible usages for predictions,

210
00:14:16,688 --> 00:14:22,310
like asset classification, behaviors programming, or even asset generations.

211
00:14:24,611 --> 00:14:27,192
It works for simple or complex datasets,

212
00:14:27,392 --> 00:14:30,013
but now, what if we just...

213
00:14:31,104 --> 00:14:34,446
don't have the data, which happens often.

214
00:14:36,367 --> 00:14:41,551
Well, we have simulations, and we can use some specific kind of algorithms

215
00:14:42,191 --> 00:14:43,872
called reinforcement learning.

216
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:52,497
The idea is simple. An agent is given a set of actions, goals, and rewards,

217
00:14:52,878 --> 00:14:57,821
when it finds a way to reach its goal. We also set punishments when it reaches

218
00:14:57,921 --> 00:15:00,022
some specific outcomes, when it fails.

219
00:15:01,338 --> 00:15:09,402
Then, the agent tries many different things in the simulations or in the game to maximize its rewards.

220
00:15:12,784 --> 00:15:18,747
After a while, by trial and errors, the algorithm finds the right strategy.

221
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:30,253
The strategy populates the neural network. This can be seen as creating the right data sets that map

222
00:15:30,707 --> 00:15:38,753
states to actions. So when a new situation is given to the neural network, it predicts

223
00:15:39,193 --> 00:15:41,255
what is the best action to take.

224
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:53,425
So here are the main things you should remember for this section. But the most important part

225
00:15:54,045 --> 00:15:58,669
is that more than a technology, it is a new way to think.

226
00:15:59,388 --> 00:16:02,389
It's less about programming a behavior.

227
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,591
It's more about choosing the right data

228
00:16:05,691 --> 00:16:09,873
set that illustrates the behavior with the objective

229
00:16:10,273 --> 00:16:11,153
to generalize it.

230
00:16:14,615 --> 00:16:17,737
So I hope you get a better idea now of the implications

231
00:16:18,037 --> 00:16:18,997
of being data-driven.

232
00:16:19,798 --> 00:16:22,159
It is not something that happens behind the scene

233
00:16:22,539 --> 00:16:25,600
or under the hood or only for technical people.

234
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:29,821
It's really a significant shift in the way most of us work,

235
00:16:30,742 --> 00:16:33,164
and it has strong production implications.

236
00:16:35,326 --> 00:16:38,829
Traditional approaches require a lot of programming.

237
00:16:39,429 --> 00:16:41,691
They provide with complete control

238
00:16:42,372 --> 00:16:44,053
in a very manageable environment.

239
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:51,660
However, they are difficult to maintain and to scale up.

240
00:16:52,443 --> 00:16:54,724
This is a very simplified version of a tree.

241
00:16:54,744 --> 00:16:58,186
If you worked with animation trees, you know what I mean.

242
00:17:00,307 --> 00:17:03,309
Conversely, data-driven approaches

243
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:07,932
lead to less programming and offer less control.

244
00:17:09,492 --> 00:17:13,215
Huge amount of data are passed through math and intuition,

245
00:17:13,675 --> 00:17:16,657
which requires to juggle between hard science

246
00:17:17,157 --> 00:17:18,838
and some sort of alchemy.

247
00:17:19,418 --> 00:17:21,099
But the rewards.

248
00:17:21,887 --> 00:17:26,530
is significant, as they lead to unprecedented capacities

249
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:29,353
to scale up with very low maintenance efforts,

250
00:17:29,533 --> 00:17:32,235
because it relies solely on training data.

251
00:17:33,116 --> 00:17:35,237
If you think about that, when you

252
00:17:35,257 --> 00:17:36,679
want to implement a new behavior,

253
00:17:37,659 --> 00:17:41,142
it only requires to add new data and retrain the model.

254
00:17:44,425 --> 00:17:48,548
Concretely, instead of focusing on creating data and rules,

255
00:17:49,209 --> 00:17:50,109
people will focus.

256
00:17:50,877 --> 00:17:56,561
on finding the right data to feed in a system that generates a desired behavior.

257
00:17:57,081 --> 00:18:01,405
Let's see how concretely this applies to some of well-known trades.

258
00:18:03,526 --> 00:18:10,811
Voice designers. Today, voice designers use a script to record actors, apply sound treatments,

259
00:18:11,472 --> 00:18:15,035
and associate each sample to a predefined action in the game.

260
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:17,556
Being data-driven.

261
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:21,783
Voice designers create the right voice inference

262
00:18:22,063 --> 00:18:23,784
that will generate voices on the fly

263
00:18:24,405 --> 00:18:25,645
based on dynamic scripts.

264
00:18:28,067 --> 00:18:28,587
Programming.

265
00:18:29,728 --> 00:18:32,909
Traditionally, there's a lot of if, this, then, that code

266
00:18:33,069 --> 00:18:35,211
that is written to program a desired behavior.

267
00:18:35,931 --> 00:18:37,712
But with data-driven approaches,

268
00:18:38,372 --> 00:18:41,034
the program learns the desired behavior

269
00:18:41,114 --> 00:18:42,715
from a database of examples.

270
00:18:42,995 --> 00:18:44,736
For example, to generate code

271
00:18:44,976 --> 00:18:46,977
or even detect potential bugs.

272
00:18:47,925 --> 00:18:49,345
and even predict online failures.

273
00:18:51,426 --> 00:18:57,189
Testing requires to follow a test plan that documents the desired in-game behavior or

274
00:18:57,529 --> 00:19:00,351
even techniques like smoke tests to assess robustness.

275
00:19:00,971 --> 00:19:06,994
But soon it will also mean operating automated test platforms that will generate tons of

276
00:19:07,014 --> 00:19:12,677
scenarios overnight and will analyze stats and logs to point out undesired behavior.

277
00:19:13,912 --> 00:19:20,017
I'm now going to show some concrete examples for people who are in charge to craft NPC behaviors.

278
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:27,582
Creating living city with traffic is difficult. Programming all situations and exceptions,

279
00:19:28,163 --> 00:19:33,247
if this then that, that's difficult. And maintaining them, that is daunting.

280
00:19:33,787 --> 00:19:40,212
So what if we used reinforcement learning? Here in our case, we give an AI agent access

281
00:19:40,232 --> 00:19:43,274
to a steering wheel, brakes and accelerator.

282
00:19:43,592 --> 00:19:50,336
And we give some rewards when it succeeds in following a trajectory or stop at intersections,

283
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:52,397
and punishments when it fails.

284
00:19:52,497 --> 00:19:59,121
And then the AI will try and learn to maximize its reward, thus developing a strategy to

285
00:19:59,141 --> 00:19:59,461
drive.

286
00:20:00,922 --> 00:20:07,485
It saves time on programming and maintenance, for example, for new vehicles, new behavior

287
00:20:07,525 --> 00:20:10,987
or specific behaviors, and even new weather conditions.

288
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,203
So it works for characters or vehicles,

289
00:20:15,764 --> 00:20:18,307
but we can also find the same kind of techniques

290
00:20:19,027 --> 00:20:21,410
for crowds or traffic.

291
00:20:23,933 --> 00:20:27,136
On the left, we have a traditional type

292
00:20:27,557 --> 00:20:29,339
of pathfinding algorithm.

293
00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:32,722
Each agent tries to optimize its own path.

294
00:20:33,563 --> 00:20:34,064
On the right.

295
00:20:34,825 --> 00:20:41,391
We have developed a new type of algorithm called Swarm that works like a shared, decentralized,

296
00:20:41,451 --> 00:20:49,137
intelligence think-flock crowd swarm. And it results as more fluid and believable behavior,

297
00:20:49,317 --> 00:20:54,502
hence providing a richer experience. I'm not saying here that one is better than the other.

298
00:20:55,363 --> 00:20:58,946
I'm just saying here that it opens new possibilities.

299
00:21:01,538 --> 00:21:07,163
Here, we trained an agent with a specific behavior, which is to drive at high speed in a city.

300
00:21:07,844 --> 00:21:10,226
So not only does it benefit our production capacity,

301
00:21:11,287 --> 00:21:15,250
it also increases the quality of the driving to make more believable worlds.

302
00:21:16,551 --> 00:21:21,416
This approach can also be applied as an assistance to game designers.

303
00:21:23,952 --> 00:21:26,334
Guaranteed hits, or what we call exploits,

304
00:21:26,595 --> 00:21:28,316
are difficult to chase, and especially

305
00:21:28,356 --> 00:21:31,299
when they involve specific patterns or combos.

306
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:36,344
Often, our community discover exploits before ourselves.

307
00:21:37,345 --> 00:21:40,628
But they open automated testing opportunities.

308
00:21:41,749 --> 00:21:43,830
Reinforcement algorithms can be used

309
00:21:43,851 --> 00:21:46,373
to let agents explore all combinations

310
00:21:46,533 --> 00:21:50,256
to check if there are some holes in complex designs.

311
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:53,815
This is particularly important for games as a service,

312
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:57,518
where you need to make sure that new content works well,

313
00:21:58,299 --> 00:22:01,221
but also does not break existing content.

314
00:22:03,783 --> 00:22:05,705
These are only a couple of concrete examples.

315
00:22:07,466 --> 00:22:08,768
There is a technical challenge,

316
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:14,412
but more importantly, it represents a huge change in the way we work,

317
00:22:14,492 --> 00:22:15,613
and this for all trades.

318
00:22:16,854 --> 00:22:18,676
And this is why we should care.

319
00:22:22,981 --> 00:22:28,944
We covered what deep learning is and have seen how it has the potential to profoundly change all of our trades.

320
00:22:29,325 --> 00:22:35,648
Now, let's see how deep and how fast the video game industry is likely to be impacted.

321
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:45,974
Many breakthroughs arise at academic stage that are spectacular, but not still ready to reach a production stage.

322
00:22:46,374 --> 00:22:50,977
For example, AI physics-based animation worked well in a sandbox.

323
00:22:51,678 --> 00:22:54,399
but are still forgies with real-time interactions.

324
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:59,222
Still, I can't wait to play a game with such advanced features.

325
00:23:01,723 --> 00:23:05,125
Some of those breakthroughs seek to simulate a player

326
00:23:05,225 --> 00:23:08,627
and even beat pro players, as you might be aware of,

327
00:23:09,948 --> 00:23:13,449
like Deep Blue did for Kasparov more than 20 years ago,

328
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:14,510
if you remember.

329
00:23:15,691 --> 00:23:19,713
However, is it robust or even simply a fun opponent?

330
00:23:20,553 --> 00:23:20,953
Not yet.

331
00:23:21,915 --> 00:23:28,579
The game is only used as a sandbox to measure the decision quality of an algorithm against

332
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,301
the quality of the decision of a human.

333
00:23:33,003 --> 00:23:37,245
Bottom line, it serves only some specific research breakthrough of the AI field.

334
00:23:38,246 --> 00:23:42,149
Games are used to test those research elements.

335
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:50,375
Which means that, even if it's spectacular, there is still a lot of research to be done.

336
00:23:53,073 --> 00:23:58,775
Conversely, it goes way faster than even experts expect.

337
00:23:59,695 --> 00:24:01,855
This is extracted from a paper from 2016.

338
00:24:02,255 --> 00:24:07,936
Hundreds of machine learning experts were asked

339
00:24:08,437 --> 00:24:12,717
when AI would be on par with humans for various tasks,

340
00:24:13,137 --> 00:24:14,678
and you see here the results.

341
00:24:15,938 --> 00:24:20,999
And for example, they said that Go would be solved

342
00:24:21,596 --> 00:24:23,937
in 10 years-ish from 2016.

343
00:24:24,357 --> 00:24:28,999
And it was solved in 2017.

344
00:24:33,361 --> 00:24:34,701
Let's talk about asset generation.

345
00:24:35,862 --> 00:24:40,063
Here are generated pictures using a technique called

346
00:24:40,523 --> 00:24:42,344
Generative Adversarial Networks.

347
00:24:43,344 --> 00:24:48,887
As you see, academic results were not that appealing for us a few years ago.

348
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:50,207
And now they are.

349
00:24:51,817 --> 00:24:57,721
and they are exponentially. Think about that. None of those faces are real.

350
00:25:00,062 --> 00:25:05,985
And in 2018, not only did it generate pictures, it now generates videos.

351
00:25:07,306 --> 00:25:11,928
We're entering an era in which our enemies can make it look like anyone is saying anything at

352
00:25:11,988 --> 00:25:18,912
any point in time, even if they would never say those things. So, for instance, they could have

353
00:25:18,972 --> 00:25:20,113
me say things like...

354
00:25:21,322 --> 00:25:23,745
I don't know, Killmonger was right.

355
00:25:24,946 --> 00:25:27,548
Or Ben Carson is in the sunken place.

356
00:25:27,948 --> 00:25:29,710
Or how about this, simply,

357
00:25:30,471 --> 00:25:32,893
President Trump is a total and complete dipshit.

358
00:25:34,114 --> 00:25:37,077
Now, you see, I would never say these things,

359
00:25:38,218 --> 00:25:39,479
at least not in a public address,

360
00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:41,621
but someone else would.

361
00:25:42,502 --> 00:25:45,024
Someone like Jordan Peele.

362
00:25:46,706 --> 00:25:47,727
This is a dangerous time.

363
00:25:49,967 --> 00:25:53,568
Moving forward, we need to be more vigilant with what we trust from the internet.

364
00:25:54,489 --> 00:25:57,891
That's a time when we need to rely on trusted news sources.

365
00:25:59,832 --> 00:26:07,595
May sound basic, but how we move forward in the age of information is going to be the

366
00:26:07,635 --> 00:26:12,738
difference between whether we survive or whether we become some kind of fucked up dystopia.

367
00:26:13,458 --> 00:26:13,779
Thank you.

368
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:15,980
Stay woke, bitches.

369
00:26:25,312 --> 00:26:29,294
So it's fun and impressive, but still not in real time.

370
00:26:29,454 --> 00:26:33,776
So now the question is, do those techniques transfer to our industry?

371
00:26:35,196 --> 00:26:36,156
I'm talking about the technique.

372
00:26:37,817 --> 00:26:40,098
As you can see in other fields of application,

373
00:26:40,518 --> 00:26:42,359
these techniques yield impressive results.

374
00:26:43,099 --> 00:26:47,461
It's far from being perfect and does not work in all situations or in real time.

375
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:49,222
But this is where we are now.

376
00:26:49,962 --> 00:26:52,083
Given the present pace of academic research.

377
00:26:52,727 --> 00:26:57,509
I'm positive that next year I should be able to interact more naturally and combine more emotions.

378
00:27:00,371 --> 00:27:01,172
Let's extrapolate.

379
00:27:02,552 --> 00:27:05,774
Here is what we expect from the recent developments.

380
00:27:06,515 --> 00:27:07,175
It goes fast.

381
00:27:07,595 --> 00:27:11,277
Three years represent the ballpark production of one AAA game.

382
00:27:13,138 --> 00:27:20,683
The question is now, how do we speed up our innovation capacity in this field while making games?

383
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:30,874
Disruptive means the capacity to shake established rules, often leading to newcomers.

384
00:27:31,494 --> 00:27:34,876
Think of Nokia versus iPhone a decade ago.

385
00:27:36,377 --> 00:27:41,420
It is less of a technical challenge than a transformation of the way we work.

386
00:27:42,601 --> 00:27:44,802
And the development of opportunity it creates also.

387
00:27:45,442 --> 00:27:52,587
This is why it is important to discuss it not only in technical tracks or from a technical

388
00:27:52,647 --> 00:27:53,207
standpoint.

389
00:27:53,917 --> 00:27:55,797
but also at a broader level.

390
00:27:57,158 --> 00:28:02,679
What are the challenges we must overcome to benefit from this in our productions?

391
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:08,401
Every technology or process has a life cycle.

392
00:28:09,722 --> 00:28:13,223
First, it takes time to provide convincing results.

393
00:28:14,363 --> 00:28:20,725
Then most problems are overcome and the recipe is improved over time before reaching a plateau.

394
00:28:21,986 --> 00:28:22,246
And then…

395
00:28:23,457 --> 00:28:26,598
a new technology emerges like deep learning.

396
00:28:28,419 --> 00:28:29,159
Let's be clear.

397
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:35,582
Today, it produces results that are globally less performance

398
00:28:36,202 --> 00:28:38,063
than our well-established recipes.

399
00:28:39,363 --> 00:28:43,565
But the question is, how much time will it take to be on par?

400
00:28:45,165 --> 00:28:46,966
We think it's going to take two to three years.

401
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:53,459
Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that deep learning will replace everything we're making

402
00:28:53,739 --> 00:28:59,322
by hand or with our current pipelines in two to three years. What I'm saying is that

403
00:28:59,922 --> 00:29:04,945
it will take significant parts of our pipelines in two to three years.

404
00:29:06,725 --> 00:29:13,368
So how do we explore this area? Because we can't build and pilot the plane at the same time.

405
00:29:16,827 --> 00:29:20,430
The nature of machine learning brings very uncommon challenges.

406
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:22,892
First, it goes fast, very fast.

407
00:29:23,092 --> 00:29:26,075
Most of our processes and production life cycles

408
00:29:26,535 --> 00:29:28,177
hurt our innovation capacity.

409
00:29:29,638 --> 00:29:36,384
It requires data, expertise, but also valuable applications.

410
00:29:36,444 --> 00:29:38,205
And very few companies have the three.

411
00:29:40,536 --> 00:29:44,118
It produces results that are industrially interesting,

412
00:29:44,338 --> 00:29:46,659
but they mostly show up at academic level.

413
00:29:47,459 --> 00:29:49,520
Therefore, it grows in a culture of openness

414
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,842
and publications that, let's be honest,

415
00:29:52,942 --> 00:29:55,343
goes against most of our industrial habits.

416
00:29:57,844 --> 00:29:59,705
It goes against most regulations,

417
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:03,326
or at the very least, requires to create some,

418
00:30:03,586 --> 00:30:05,327
because it raises important questions,

419
00:30:05,587 --> 00:30:08,149
like the authoring of generated assets.

420
00:30:09,814 --> 00:30:11,216
Who is the creator?

421
00:30:12,497 --> 00:30:16,602
Data ownership or even usage, like voice imprints

422
00:30:16,923 --> 00:30:20,126
for text-to-speech or data privacy.

423
00:30:22,289 --> 00:30:23,911
And did I mention it goes fast?

424
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:27,415
I mean, since I started talking, a relevant paper probably

425
00:30:27,876 --> 00:30:29,017
hit the internet.

426
00:30:31,657 --> 00:30:33,858
So, how do we address those challenges?

427
00:30:34,419 --> 00:30:36,620
There is no one-size-fits-all solution.

428
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:39,122
We all have different production realities.

429
00:30:39,663 --> 00:30:43,466
So I will try to share now a solution that worked well

430
00:30:43,526 --> 00:30:47,248
for Ubisoft, and maybe some elements might be useful

431
00:30:47,529 --> 00:30:48,449
to your own context.

432
00:30:51,091 --> 00:30:55,255
This is the type of open world we create at Ubisoft.

433
00:30:56,932 --> 00:31:01,914
We offer rich interactions for the player, and all of this requires tons of data,

434
00:31:03,075 --> 00:31:08,998
textures, animations, models, but also AI to drive the world's components behaviors.

435
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:16,061
Those simulations offer appealing technical and scientific challenges,

436
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:20,003
but also interesting assets to solve them.

437
00:31:24,384 --> 00:31:26,205
We saw that as gaming industry.

438
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,600
We have two great assets.

439
00:31:27,821 --> 00:31:30,743
First, we have our game engines that

440
00:31:30,783 --> 00:31:33,745
can be used to train or test artificial intelligence.

441
00:31:34,285 --> 00:31:38,088
And second, we have a lot of very specific data,

442
00:31:38,468 --> 00:31:42,851
such as mocap data, textures, dialogues, models.

443
00:31:43,832 --> 00:31:47,535
Creating or using this data is key to the development

444
00:31:47,755 --> 00:31:48,455
of deep learning.

445
00:31:49,356 --> 00:31:53,579
So how do we make it happen when AI, machine learning,

446
00:31:54,199 --> 00:31:56,381
developments is still essentially.

447
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:57,740
at academic level.

448
00:32:00,523 --> 00:32:05,987
This is a path of innovation, and this is a scale of love.

449
00:32:06,247 --> 00:32:11,531
Love being whatever you want, depending on your values, money, recognition, attention,

450
00:32:11,711 --> 00:32:12,372
investments.

451
00:32:14,453 --> 00:32:20,458
A good researcher is known by the quality and quantity of his or her research publication,

452
00:32:20,838 --> 00:32:26,483
which means that the academic world puts a lot of love on the left side of innovation.

453
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:31,662
At Ubisoft, we focus on creating amazing experiences.

454
00:32:32,062 --> 00:32:36,365
So when we try to collaborate on academic topics

455
00:32:36,405 --> 00:32:39,528
such as deep learning, there is in the middle

456
00:32:39,968 --> 00:32:44,511
what I call the terrible gap of wasted ideas.

457
00:32:46,152 --> 00:32:50,635
And almost three years ago, we decided to bridge this gap.

458
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:57,935
Ubisoft La Forge is an open place where we bring in our people and researchers to work

459
00:32:57,995 --> 00:33:05,701
on prototypes that serve both interests, make greater games while creating public knowledge.

460
00:33:07,243 --> 00:33:12,427
Researchers at La Forge have access to everything like our employees do, our data, our experts,

461
00:33:12,947 --> 00:33:15,790
our technologies, our facilities.

462
00:33:16,992 --> 00:33:19,992
Laforge was created in Montreal three years ago,

463
00:33:20,152 --> 00:33:22,373
and now spreading in other Canadian studios.

464
00:33:22,473 --> 00:33:24,073
Just to give rough numbers, we're

465
00:33:24,173 --> 00:33:26,954
working with eight universities regularly,

466
00:33:26,974 --> 00:33:32,015
hosting at each point in time 20-ish active projects.

467
00:33:34,336 --> 00:33:36,116
So let's pretend now we have a prototype.

468
00:33:37,456 --> 00:33:41,677
Then the main challenge is to match irrelevant AI results

469
00:33:42,277 --> 00:33:46,238
with a real valuable application, not only a stunt.

470
00:33:48,876 --> 00:33:52,678
The key is to create prototypes in parallel of production cycles

471
00:33:53,658 --> 00:33:56,640
and make them target a well-defined scope.

472
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:00,702
So in other words, be production plan B.

473
00:34:03,964 --> 00:34:06,885
All my previous examples were prototypes

474
00:34:07,225 --> 00:34:10,767
that are not implemented in an announced game.

475
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:14,272
I'm now going to show concrete prototypes

476
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:16,713
that were implemented in production

477
00:34:16,973 --> 00:34:19,535
without being initially part of a plan.

478
00:34:20,935 --> 00:34:23,197
Next is a prototype from last year,

479
00:34:24,057 --> 00:34:25,978
based on Assassin's Creed Origins.

480
00:34:26,779 --> 00:34:30,261
Unlike my previous example, it uses real actors' voices.

481
00:34:31,021 --> 00:34:33,162
It was a new machine learning-based technology

482
00:34:33,182 --> 00:34:37,565
called sound matching that animates lips based on voice,

483
00:34:38,025 --> 00:34:41,347
and these for any language as well as barks.

484
00:34:42,051 --> 00:34:44,492
Why waste time with politics?

485
00:34:45,012 --> 00:34:46,052
I say to my boss,

486
00:34:46,132 --> 00:34:49,374
you're going to the Zambians.

487
00:34:49,394 --> 00:34:49,914
Where to?

488
00:34:50,394 --> 00:34:51,274
Dictatorship!

489
00:34:51,314 --> 00:34:52,975
My ships are coming.

490
00:34:53,055 --> 00:34:56,456
It seems that your Roman

491
00:34:56,776 --> 00:34:59,757
needs protection at the end of the day.

492
00:35:00,438 --> 00:35:01,778
Oh la la la!

493
00:35:03,399 --> 00:35:05,559
So the Assassin's Creed Odyssey team

494
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:08,140
decided a few months before Goldmaster

495
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:11,481
that a prototype was worthy to implement it.

496
00:35:12,875 --> 00:35:17,237
It decreased costs while increasing the localization

497
00:35:17,357 --> 00:35:17,837
quality.

498
00:35:17,997 --> 00:35:21,359
And the game was praised for the quality of this localization,

499
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:22,379
amongst other things.

500
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,340
Here is a short seconds taken from the game.

501
00:35:26,601 --> 00:35:27,741
Cassandra, it's you!

502
00:35:28,502 --> 00:35:28,902
Phoebe!

503
00:35:30,483 --> 00:35:32,323
I promised I'd see you again, and here you are!

504
00:35:32,403 --> 00:35:34,744
I told you to stay away from trouble.

505
00:35:34,804 --> 00:35:35,004
I did!

506
00:35:35,185 --> 00:35:35,325
Well...

507
00:35:42,222 --> 00:35:43,102
I tried.

508
00:35:44,883 --> 00:35:46,504
How did you get here, Febe?

509
00:35:46,584 --> 00:35:50,306
I did some drag, working for Marco.

510
00:35:50,806 --> 00:35:52,867
You paid someone to take you to Athens?

511
00:35:56,429 --> 00:36:00,752
For Honor is a sword fighting game that relies on many different opponents,

512
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:03,713
which are regularly added to the game.

513
00:36:04,814 --> 00:36:09,636
So in this game, we prototyped an automated testing feature

514
00:36:10,196 --> 00:36:11,357
to find exploits.

515
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,901
It helps designers to fine-tune the balancing also.

516
00:36:15,801 --> 00:36:19,442
Here, the smart bot in orange tries

517
00:36:19,522 --> 00:36:22,163
to beat the regular in-game warden in blue.

518
00:36:22,483 --> 00:36:25,444
And as you can see, the smart bot

519
00:36:26,104 --> 00:36:28,445
developed a kiting strategy by itself

520
00:36:28,785 --> 00:36:30,245
using reinforcement learning.

521
00:36:35,567 --> 00:36:40,028
Trades are changing, but the way they work together also.

522
00:36:41,354 --> 00:36:46,398
Traditional programming pipelines involves many stages to test the code and find bugs.

523
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:54,404
With large teams or for quick turnarounds like continuous integration, it can become daunting.

524
00:36:56,205 --> 00:37:03,310
What if we leverage the data of past bugs and corrections to estimate the probability

525
00:37:04,071 --> 00:37:09,635
that a new portion of code includes a bug before it is tested?

526
00:37:10,693 --> 00:37:16,677
Last year, we unveiled a prototype called Commit Assistant that does exactly that.

527
00:37:20,059 --> 00:37:26,142
It has been first implemented on Rainbow Six and is now reaching other productions worldwide.

528
00:37:27,723 --> 00:37:35,127
On Rainbow Six, there are still 30%-ish of false alarms, and this should decrease over time

529
00:37:35,968 --> 00:37:38,029
as the system continues to learn.

530
00:37:41,277 --> 00:37:41,938
Is it magical?

531
00:37:42,898 --> 00:37:43,599
No.

532
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,481
Still, you need to add some alchemy to the science.

533
00:37:48,062 --> 00:37:52,685
As we saw before, the output depends on your data,

534
00:37:53,425 --> 00:37:55,507
and your data sets, and your algorithm.

535
00:37:56,067 --> 00:38:00,630
And crafting all of this requires a lot of intuition

536
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:03,972
and the involvement of experts from different trades.

537
00:38:05,373 --> 00:38:07,175
As an apprentice alchemist.

538
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:10,214
This is the kind of results you will often get.

539
00:38:10,674 --> 00:38:12,856
At least, that's what we got.

540
00:38:12,876 --> 00:38:16,158
This is the kind of results you will often get.

541
00:38:16,238 --> 00:38:18,840
At least, that's what we got.

542
00:38:27,107 --> 00:38:27,467
Bye!

543
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:15,531
So now it's time to sum up the things we covered.

544
00:39:18,032 --> 00:39:24,294
More than a technology, machine learning represents a shift in the way we program a desired behavior.

545
00:39:25,554 --> 00:39:27,175
It focuses on the data.

546
00:39:28,035 --> 00:39:35,579
and raises questions of quantity, diversity, representativity, curation, variety, usage, etc.

547
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:43,303
It is deeply changing our industry, both because it requires to think differently

548
00:39:44,544 --> 00:39:47,786
and because all crafts and processes are impacted.

549
00:39:49,327 --> 00:39:55,710
Creation assistance is often a good angle to accelerate a pipeline while in production

550
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:57,211
and not miss the train.

551
00:39:59,832 --> 00:40:02,233
It goes fast, and it's still exploratory.

552
00:40:03,514 --> 00:40:06,075
I suggest not planning for it,

553
00:40:06,636 --> 00:40:07,796
like you would for a feature.

554
00:40:09,557 --> 00:40:11,539
Conversely, I would advocate you

555
00:40:11,559 --> 00:40:14,220
to find your own prototyping pace,

556
00:40:15,261 --> 00:40:17,582
and a research model that is linked

557
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:20,184
to your production within your reality.

558
00:40:21,325 --> 00:40:24,647
Being production plan B is probably good idea

559
00:40:24,847 --> 00:40:27,748
when playing with such disruptive elements.

560
00:40:29,981 --> 00:40:30,321
Thank you.

561
00:40:31,282 --> 00:40:32,402
I think we have time for questions.

562
00:40:46,772 --> 00:40:47,752
Are you shy?

563
00:40:48,172 --> 00:40:48,433
Or...

564
00:40:52,675 --> 00:40:54,537
On the mic, please.

565
00:40:55,057 --> 00:40:57,398
So that everybody can hear it.

566
00:40:58,379 --> 00:40:59,360
You mentioned that you...

567
00:41:00,706 --> 00:41:04,129
in a kind of deep relationship with universities in Canada.

568
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:11,636
And it's understandable how academia benefits the company,

569
00:41:12,997 --> 00:41:15,859
but how the company benefits academia.

570
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:19,242
What kind of, what you're giving back to academia.

571
00:41:19,943 --> 00:41:20,804
Excellent question.

572
00:41:22,205 --> 00:41:26,869
What I didn't mention is that Ubisoft La Forge has,

573
00:41:27,625 --> 00:41:33,749
few rules, but one of it is extremely important, which is collocation. In other words, researchers

574
00:41:33,869 --> 00:41:40,134
come in our studio so that they have access to everything. So as a researcher, think about

575
00:41:40,334 --> 00:41:41,956
animation. You work in...

576
00:41:42,903 --> 00:41:49,448
in deep learning on animation, there are very few data sets that you can use to make your research.

577
00:41:50,009 --> 00:41:54,733
So when you come at La Forge working with us, you have directly access to the tons and tons

578
00:41:54,793 --> 00:42:02,339
and tons of data that we have. So that's one aspect. But also, we are pushing for publications.

579
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:10,386
So each researcher who comes at Ubisoft La Forge is incentivized to publish and share

580
00:42:11,427 --> 00:42:12,108
what we discovered.

581
00:42:12,915 --> 00:42:19,277
Actually, if you go on our website, lafourche.ubisoft.com, you will see many papers or links to many

582
00:42:19,738 --> 00:42:26,880
papers, including the commit assistance, so the AI thing that's, you know, try to catch

583
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:29,621
bugs in the minds of programmers.

584
00:42:33,582 --> 00:42:34,482
Hi, excellent talk.

585
00:42:34,522 --> 00:42:35,562
Thanks for doing this.

586
00:42:36,443 --> 00:42:37,443
I have a question for you.

587
00:42:38,603 --> 00:42:41,004
So it seems, and maybe it's my perception of this.

588
00:42:41,929 --> 00:42:45,671
that you have a focus on this tool, on machine learning.

589
00:42:46,351 --> 00:42:48,772
Can you speak of what is your perspective?

590
00:42:48,813 --> 00:42:52,415
Because there are, to me, two ways of having an R&D group.

591
00:42:52,875 --> 00:42:56,677
You can believe in a tool and then try to apply it around,

592
00:42:57,417 --> 00:42:59,299
or go around and shop for problems

593
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:01,240
and then find the best tools for those.

594
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:03,781
And sometimes we say, you shouldn't use a hammer

595
00:43:03,821 --> 00:43:06,603
and then try to, you know.

596
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:08,424
But what is the advantage that you see in this?

597
00:43:08,964 --> 00:43:10,485
Yeah, excellent question.

598
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,082
La Forge is not a machine learning department.

599
00:43:17,082 --> 00:43:19,244
La Forge is an R&D department.

600
00:43:21,025 --> 00:43:22,926
Apparently, in the academic world,

601
00:43:23,207 --> 00:43:27,850
most of the most interesting applicable results that we have

602
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:31,112
revolves around machine learning, deep learning,

603
00:43:31,152 --> 00:43:33,654
reinforcement learning, which is why it's something

604
00:43:33,734 --> 00:43:37,996
that we should take care of as a gaming industry.

605
00:43:38,357 --> 00:43:39,337
But actually.

606
00:43:40,591 --> 00:43:47,674
We work exactly the way you described at Ubisoft LaForge, which is we bring in problems, suggestions,

607
00:43:48,194 --> 00:43:54,576
and then we try new things, whether it's machine learning, biometry, or even social sciences.

608
00:43:58,778 --> 00:44:00,258
Hello, my name is Martin Klima.

609
00:44:00,939 --> 00:44:02,619
Thank you very much for your talk.

610
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:05,240
I have a very specific question.

611
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:08,802
I was very impressed by the quality of the generated voice.

612
00:44:09,808 --> 00:44:12,328
Can you please expand on this?

613
00:44:12,709 --> 00:44:17,830
When do you think this will become a viable alternative to actual actor recording?

614
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:22,731
It's a tough one. It really depends.

615
00:44:24,591 --> 00:44:25,711
This is an opinion.

616
00:44:26,632 --> 00:44:29,992
I think that we will need actors.

617
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:35,373
We will need artists to add that extra layer of emotion.

618
00:44:36,102 --> 00:44:42,083
However, there are many situations where you don't need to put a lot of effort recording

619
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:49,165
artists and managing the data and post-processing, etc.

620
00:44:49,245 --> 00:44:54,726
So I think that it's going to be something that will happen gradually.

621
00:44:54,986 --> 00:45:01,688
In other words, today I know that some games already use text-to-speech.

622
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:05,691
for some voices that are not that important,

623
00:45:05,751 --> 00:45:09,433
just you add more diversity in their worlds.

624
00:45:09,994 --> 00:45:12,415
But then when you need more emotions

625
00:45:12,695 --> 00:45:16,758
or to convey more complex information to the player,

626
00:45:17,278 --> 00:45:20,460
maybe it's a good idea to keep real humans.

627
00:45:20,821 --> 00:45:22,922
And this will happen gradually, I think.

628
00:45:26,084 --> 00:45:28,206
Hi, so one of the biggest challenges

629
00:45:28,246 --> 00:45:29,747
with machine learning is debuggability.

630
00:45:30,312 --> 00:45:32,713
Do you have any insights for the things

631
00:45:32,733 --> 00:45:34,854
that you experimented that improved the availability

632
00:45:34,934 --> 00:45:35,955
of machine learning models?

633
00:45:36,595 --> 00:45:37,536
The believability, you mean?

634
00:45:37,556 --> 00:45:40,077
The availability, diagnosing or understanding

635
00:45:40,097 --> 00:45:41,578
if the model is actually working or not.

636
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,381
Not really, because I'm not an expert, I would say.

637
00:45:47,461 --> 00:45:52,624
But definitely what I would say is it offers less control.

638
00:45:53,265 --> 00:45:53,685
Definitely.

639
00:45:54,185 --> 00:45:56,627
Now the question is more to try to assess,

640
00:45:56,807 --> 00:45:58,207
is it important or not?

641
00:45:58,848 --> 00:45:59,728
And that's where we need.

642
00:46:00,321 --> 00:46:02,162
are experts from different trades.

643
00:46:02,703 --> 00:46:05,405
If you are, there were some very interesting talk

644
00:46:06,146 --> 00:46:10,230
about usage of, very specific usage of machine learning

645
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:13,573
on boats, on animation made by Daniel as an example.

646
00:46:14,073 --> 00:46:18,397
As you can see, the models are never exactly predicting

647
00:46:18,617 --> 00:46:19,318
the ground truth.

648
00:46:19,822 --> 00:46:24,463
Now you need this external eye of a real professional, a real animator,

649
00:46:24,883 --> 00:46:27,584
that will say, hmm, is it important in that case?

650
00:46:28,184 --> 00:46:30,065
So maybe you want to generate a crowd,

651
00:46:30,605 --> 00:46:35,606
and maybe, you know, it's okay, it works well to the eye.

652
00:46:36,107 --> 00:46:40,708
But conversely, if you need animations for some specific gameplay,

653
00:46:41,328 --> 00:46:43,489
fighting as an example,

654
00:46:44,069 --> 00:46:48,370
then using deep learning techniques or machine learning techniques.

655
00:46:48,989 --> 00:46:55,191
might be more tricky because you might have more difficult time to tweak things and try

656
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:58,532
to explain how the system will react.

657
00:47:03,073 --> 00:47:04,553
Hey, thank you for the talk.

658
00:47:04,573 --> 00:47:11,255
I guess my question was kind of related, but given the potential unpredictability of a

659
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:16,296
lot of these systems, do you have a standard evaluation pipeline to get it to a point when

660
00:47:16,316 --> 00:47:18,017
you're comfortable putting it into production?

661
00:47:19,452 --> 00:47:22,915
The most standard evaluation pipeline we have

662
00:47:24,276 --> 00:47:26,998
are called people, actually.

663
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:31,722
We're not, Ubisoft La Forge is not meant

664
00:47:31,742 --> 00:47:33,884
to create products or services.

665
00:47:34,324 --> 00:47:35,405
We create prototypes.

666
00:47:35,946 --> 00:47:39,329
So we're very far, when something goes out of La Forge,

667
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:42,852
it's very far to being something that is plug and play

668
00:47:42,872 --> 00:47:43,352
for production.

669
00:47:44,531 --> 00:47:50,054
What we try to do, and because all of those questions of testing, reliability, predictability,

670
00:47:50,294 --> 00:47:57,377
and et cetera, what we try to do is we have a prototype that works well, that proves solving

671
00:47:57,537 --> 00:47:58,438
a real problem.

672
00:47:59,018 --> 00:48:05,261
We bring this prototype and then hand that off to productions who will adapt that to

673
00:48:05,321 --> 00:48:06,021
their pipeline.

674
00:48:06,681 --> 00:48:13,385
So as an example, we were talking about the commit assistance, which tries to address

675
00:48:14,135 --> 00:48:17,616
the probability that some code that is submitted contains bugs.

676
00:48:18,916 --> 00:48:27,299
What is the right level of reliability or probability that you want to reach?

677
00:48:27,799 --> 00:48:29,680
Is 70% enough?

678
00:48:32,341 --> 00:48:35,222
Only a programmer can tell, right?

679
00:48:36,022 --> 00:48:37,022
So we work with them.

680
00:48:37,763 --> 00:48:39,523
And working with...

681
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:46,072
people from the trade, programmers, animators, is always a good idea because they will decide

682
00:48:46,572 --> 00:48:55,815
what in which usage it helps them, it augments them, and it's not like an additional burden,

683
00:48:55,975 --> 00:49:01,096
an additional, I don't know, dashboard that they received or things like that.

684
00:49:02,436 --> 00:49:04,777
So we are also learning with that a lot.

685
00:49:04,797 --> 00:49:09,598
Any more questions?

686
00:49:13,089 --> 00:49:13,852
I guess it's a no.

687
00:49:14,536 --> 00:49:15,159
Thank you very much.
