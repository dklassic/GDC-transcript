00:00:01,398 --> 00:00:05,081
There's a perception out there that the average game is mindless entertainment,

2
00:00:05,401 --> 00:00:09,683
with at best a thin story, cardboard cutout characters, and stilted acting.

3
00:00:10,163 --> 00:00:11,404
What is it you're after anyway?

4
00:00:11,684 --> 00:00:14,826
But many companies have been working tirelessly against that stigma.

5
00:00:15,426 --> 00:00:18,948
Here at Naughty Dog, we work hard to ensure our performances are believable,

6
00:00:19,489 --> 00:00:20,990
emotionally relevant to the player,

7
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,991
and blend with our gameplay as seamlessly as possible.

8
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:25,832
Are you out of your goddamn mind?

9
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,253
Yep, probably!

10
00:00:28,914 --> 00:00:33,638
Hi there, I'm Ryan James, Lead Editor at Naughty Dog, and this year at GDC, I'm going to be

11
00:00:33,678 --> 00:00:37,722
sharing some of the methods our team employs when implementing realistic performances in

12
00:00:37,782 --> 00:00:41,145
our games, both inside and especially outside our cutscenes.

13
00:00:44,828 --> 00:00:49,092
You don't have to be a designer or an audio engineer for this one, it's open to all disciplines

14
00:00:49,112 --> 00:00:52,195
who are interested in some nuts and bolts on the why and how of what we do.

15
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,549
So please join me for realistic performances in games.

16
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:58,694
I hope to see you there.
