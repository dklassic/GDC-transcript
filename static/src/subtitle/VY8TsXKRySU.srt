00:00:05,576 --> 00:00:05,976
Hello.

2
00:00:07,316 --> 00:00:07,856
Hi everyone.

3
00:00:09,217 --> 00:00:10,997
Well, welcome to room 2016,

4
00:00:11,297 --> 00:00:14,238
which is where my talk actually is, not room 2024,

5
00:00:14,678 --> 00:00:16,318
which is where I thought my talk was

6
00:00:16,818 --> 00:00:19,099
and could have caused things to end very, very badly

7
00:00:19,159 --> 00:00:21,699
had a nice tall gentleman not sent me straight.

8
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:23,620
So I'm glad you're here.

9
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:24,540
I'm glad I'm here.

10
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,300
Let's do this thing.

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,641
But ceremonial housekeeping before we begin,

12
00:00:30,621 --> 00:00:32,822
please turn your phones to silent.

13
00:00:34,482 --> 00:00:34,722
Orbs.

14
00:00:36,234 --> 00:00:39,236
face embarrassment when they play a tune that you're not expecting.

15
00:00:41,758 --> 00:00:43,279
And I think we're good. Has everybody got seats?

16
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:49,584
It looks like we're maybe perfectly balanced in terms of habitation.

17
00:00:49,865 --> 00:00:50,325
It's pretty cool.

18
00:00:51,546 --> 00:00:54,508
Okay. So, welcome to Dots That Go For Walks.

19
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:57,331
My name is Margaret Robertson.

20
00:00:58,011 --> 00:01:00,653
I'm a game director at a company called Dots.

21
00:01:02,767 --> 00:01:03,848
See if you can keep up with me here,

22
00:01:04,068 --> 00:01:06,330
but we've made three games,

23
00:01:07,812 --> 00:01:08,152
dots,

24
00:01:11,075 --> 00:01:11,815
two dots,

25
00:01:13,897 --> 00:01:17,221
and then the groundbreaking, dots and co.

26
00:01:22,385 --> 00:01:24,087
And so I'm currently looking after two dots,

27
00:01:24,147 --> 00:01:25,829
and last year, so Judo is our biggest game.

28
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:27,837
And I'm looking after that at the moment.

29
00:01:27,897 --> 00:01:30,538
Last year I launched Dots & Co, which is our newest game.

30
00:01:31,378 --> 00:01:35,000
And that is what I do all day, every day,

31
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,480
is I look at those screens and I think about

32
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:40,442
how to make them different or better.

33
00:01:42,822 --> 00:01:46,064
Dots are a big part of my life and my brain.

34
00:01:46,144 --> 00:01:50,885
And that's why I love this quote so much,

35
00:01:51,325 --> 00:01:53,026
which is where the title of the talk comes from.

36
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:55,627
A line is a dot that went for a walk.

37
00:01:57,145 --> 00:01:59,526
Paul Clay, who you may know,

38
00:02:02,268 --> 00:02:03,508
makes beautiful paintings like this.

39
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:07,771
I love the, I love the quote

40
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:09,832
because it encapsulates a thing that I've found

41
00:02:09,852 --> 00:02:11,773
in the last couple of years of working on these games,

42
00:02:11,853 --> 00:02:14,174
which is that even if you start

43
00:02:14,194 --> 00:02:16,875
with this incredibly simplistic object,

44
00:02:17,576 --> 00:02:20,517
hardly get more primal in terms of a shape in a circle,

45
00:02:21,938 --> 00:02:23,539
the minute you start.

46
00:02:24,741 --> 00:02:26,222
pushing at the question of what it can do

47
00:02:26,282 --> 00:02:27,123
and where it can take you,

48
00:02:27,503 --> 00:02:34,789
it can grow into far more exciting and interesting objects

49
00:02:34,809 --> 00:02:35,950
than you ever dreamed possible.

50
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:37,772
But I also love the,

51
00:02:39,213 --> 00:02:40,694
this is unbelievably exciting for me

52
00:02:40,714 --> 00:02:43,136
that that quote isn't just a cute line,

53
00:02:43,216 --> 00:02:45,678
it's a line from Paul Klee who I admire so enormously.

54
00:02:47,591 --> 00:02:54,475
I'm not enough of an art historian to give you a kind of full breakdown of where his work fits into

55
00:02:55,656 --> 00:03:02,020
various 20th century trends of obstruction and minimalism, but I am enough of a fan of art that

56
00:03:02,361 --> 00:03:13,268
fits those descriptors to know that a lot of what is precious to me about that art, the way

57
00:03:15,214 --> 00:03:19,456
that it can accomplish so much with such a restrained toolkit,

58
00:03:19,476 --> 00:03:23,818
such a limited use of shape, abandonment

59
00:03:23,858 --> 00:03:27,519
of representative, figurative elements,

60
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:38,684
this really meticulous and dynamic use of color.

61
00:03:39,724 --> 00:03:41,085
Those are things, although it's not a,

62
00:03:44,037 --> 00:03:48,559
a set of kind of resources that we necessarily look at very much in game, the game sphere,

63
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:53,302
perhaps spend as much time in modern art galleries as we should, but I know that whenever I kind of

64
00:03:53,422 --> 00:03:58,305
go and spend some time in those environments, I come back with a whole bunch of ideas of things

65
00:03:58,345 --> 00:04:05,729
that I would like to see kind of brought to life in the games that I'm making, because I think that's

66
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:14,122
an important note to hit before we kind of get into the guts of what does it take to do minimalist design well

67
00:04:14,622 --> 00:04:17,683
in a game context and particularly in a commercial game context,

68
00:04:19,464 --> 00:04:25,666
which is to make sure that you're really clear about what you're trying to accomplish and why it's worth accomplishing.

69
00:04:26,206 --> 00:04:28,246
So I wouldn't want anyone to come away.

70
00:04:30,463 --> 00:04:32,684
with a kind of, with the thought that

71
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:34,764
I'm suggesting any kind of hierarchy here.

72
00:04:35,284 --> 00:04:39,105
I get excited about very, very minimalist design approaches.

73
00:04:39,186 --> 00:04:41,686
I think there's a lot of admirable

74
00:04:46,128 --> 00:04:47,488
disciplines they require of you

75
00:04:47,528 --> 00:04:49,189
in terms of how you work and how you design.

76
00:04:49,869 --> 00:04:52,310
But I'm also an enormous fan of

77
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:56,321
stupid, massive maximalist design.

78
00:04:56,341 --> 00:04:59,403
I had a bit that I cut because we haven't got time about how

79
00:04:59,423 --> 00:05:02,705
good the UI design in Ascension Chronicle of the God Slayer is.

80
00:05:02,745 --> 00:05:04,806
I don't know if we have any Ascension fans in.

81
00:05:05,326 --> 00:05:06,447
But it's an absolute, I was trying

82
00:05:06,467 --> 00:05:08,968
to think of the least minimal UI I could think of in games,

83
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:09,969
and that's a strong candidate.

84
00:05:10,489 --> 00:05:12,611
And it's absolutely masterful.

85
00:05:12,811 --> 00:05:14,272
So if you can face the learning curve,

86
00:05:15,613 --> 00:05:17,234
I'd quietly start downloading that now

87
00:05:17,254 --> 00:05:19,335
because it'll take most of the session.

88
00:05:19,935 --> 00:05:22,577
So these are the things that I find so resonant.

89
00:05:23,673 --> 00:05:31,962
in work by Paul Klee or Richard Serra or Sol LeWitt or whoever else we might be looking at as a kind of art inspiration for this kind of design.

90
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:37,428
You know, these feel like the kind of bones,

91
00:05:37,468 --> 00:05:40,109
the things that I'm really trying to feel out

92
00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:41,470
in whatever it is I'm making,

93
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:46,092
that I want my games to have these hallmarks,

94
00:05:46,132 --> 00:05:48,153
to have this feeling that they've been made

95
00:05:48,213 --> 00:05:49,774
with restraint, with self-discipline,

96
00:05:49,794 --> 00:05:52,275
that whatever elements I put in front of you

97
00:05:52,335 --> 00:05:56,937
have this kind of total clarity and crispness

98
00:05:56,977 --> 00:06:02,900
so that you feel their edges really cleanly.

99
00:06:04,544 --> 00:06:06,226
I fundamentally like working in an abstract

100
00:06:06,326 --> 00:06:09,951
rather than a figurative or a narrative environment.

101
00:06:11,272 --> 00:06:13,275
And all of that needs to be delivered

102
00:06:13,315 --> 00:06:15,237
with a very high degree of care,

103
00:06:15,337 --> 00:06:16,959
or you just end up with something that feels inert

104
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,742
and cheap and flat.

105
00:06:19,863 --> 00:06:20,003
So.

106
00:06:22,186 --> 00:06:23,507
I spent a bunch of time looking at our own games,

107
00:06:23,527 --> 00:06:25,108
looking at other games that I admire

108
00:06:25,308 --> 00:06:26,149
that I think do this well,

109
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:29,111
and tried to put together a little kind of shopping list

110
00:06:29,512 --> 00:06:31,753
of advice that I found useful.

111
00:06:33,194 --> 00:06:34,095
So I thought I should start

112
00:06:34,195 --> 00:06:35,736
by trying to live up to this list, right?

113
00:06:35,756 --> 00:06:38,919
Okay, this is all nice, fine and dandy list,

114
00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:41,321
but can I show you something

115
00:06:42,321 --> 00:06:43,843
that really delivers those hallmarks?

116
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,944
Can I find a design approach

117
00:06:46,485 --> 00:06:48,346
where I just with a few strokes,

118
00:06:48,386 --> 00:06:50,308
with just the lightest of touch,

119
00:06:51,986 --> 00:06:52,986
using all of this restraint,

120
00:06:53,466 --> 00:06:54,727
reaching for all of this clarity,

121
00:06:54,867 --> 00:06:57,727
I can add an element visually to the game

122
00:06:58,407 --> 00:07:00,608
that gives me this impact.

123
00:07:03,768 --> 00:07:04,449
So I gave it a go,

124
00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:06,889
I put something together just before this talk.

125
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:09,970
So you'll have to tell me how I did.

126
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,210
This is what I came up with.

127
00:07:14,991 --> 00:07:15,891
It's the word boat.

128
00:07:20,354 --> 00:07:22,555
I'm not, it's funny, I'm not quite getting the applause

129
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:23,095
that I was hoping.

130
00:07:23,635 --> 00:07:26,156
But you should be applauding.

131
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:28,076
Look at this thing, look at that thing.

132
00:07:28,817 --> 00:07:31,437
It's a few beautiful lines, it's some perfect curves,

133
00:07:32,258 --> 00:07:35,179
the verticals, it looks great.

134
00:07:35,499 --> 00:07:37,539
It's a really beautiful pattern.

135
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:38,700
If you didn't know what that was,

136
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,440
and I duplicated it on a.

137
00:07:41,713 --> 00:07:43,474
beautiful piece of fabric and made a dress out of it,

138
00:07:43,514 --> 00:07:44,955
you would think it was the best thing you'd ever seen.

139
00:07:45,855 --> 00:07:51,557
It's a complete abstraction and yet entirely represents

140
00:07:52,197 --> 00:07:57,639
the entire concept and visualization of boat.

141
00:07:58,259 --> 00:07:59,820
It is boat, but it is not boat.

142
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,600
It is the map, not the landscape.

143
00:08:03,141 --> 00:08:04,541
It's extraordinary.

144
00:08:04,981 --> 00:08:06,322
The more I look at it, the happier I get.

145
00:08:08,242 --> 00:08:09,123
Because type.

146
00:08:10,175 --> 00:08:10,917
does this really well.

147
00:08:11,217 --> 00:08:17,028
Type is a very, very restrained mode of visual communication.

148
00:08:17,408 --> 00:08:18,751
It has absolute clarity.

149
00:08:19,652 --> 00:08:21,255
It delivers that abstraction, and it

150
00:08:21,295 --> 00:08:22,197
delivers that precision.

151
00:08:22,217 --> 00:08:22,277
But.

152
00:08:23,387 --> 00:08:24,608
A boat is a boat is a boat.

153
00:08:25,988 --> 00:08:28,268
And because I know that my stupid boat slide

154
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:29,749
wasn't gonna impress you enough,

155
00:08:30,229 --> 00:08:31,609
it's all right, I had something up my sleeve.

156
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,090
Have you been seeing this guy's work on Twitter?

157
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:34,990
This popped up last week

158
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:37,211
and I fell in love with it so powerfully.

159
00:08:38,331 --> 00:08:40,532
He's a designer who makes these amazing illustrations

160
00:08:40,792 --> 00:08:44,613
out of the Arabic script for the word that they...

161
00:08:45,998 --> 00:08:47,039
for the word for the thing.

162
00:08:47,119 --> 00:08:48,860
So if you look in the bottom right of that panel,

163
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,723
there's the Arabic script for whale,

164
00:08:51,903 --> 00:08:54,806
and then he draws out of that these gorgeous illustrations.

165
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:55,666
There's a whole collection of them.

166
00:08:55,686 --> 00:08:57,508
There's foxes and monkeys and castles and crowns,

167
00:08:57,568 --> 00:08:58,489
and it's the best.

168
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:02,572
And it just was a really useful reminder to me

169
00:09:03,954 --> 00:09:07,116
of just how much a visual design element type is.

170
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:11,908
And it wasn't surprising that it was in my mind

171
00:09:12,028 --> 00:09:15,572
because it turns out that other designers

172
00:09:15,612 --> 00:09:18,314
of minimalist games also seem to think

173
00:09:18,354 --> 00:09:19,776
that type is a good place to start

174
00:09:19,996 --> 00:09:21,197
when you're trying to do this job well.

175
00:09:22,178 --> 00:09:27,703
So this is the very initial onboarding tutorial screen

176
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:28,784
from three different games.

177
00:09:28,804 --> 00:09:33,048
In the middle is Two Dots, which I currently work on,

178
00:09:33,068 --> 00:09:34,169
but I didn't design this screen.

179
00:09:35,484 --> 00:09:41,849
On the left is Sputnik Eyes, which is a super cute little spatial puzzler that's hard to

180
00:09:41,869 --> 00:09:43,991
explain, but you should try.

181
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:51,898
And on the right is Noodles, that's Noodles, because it has an exclamation mark, which

182
00:09:52,339 --> 00:09:53,039
is a pipe.

183
00:09:55,098 --> 00:09:55,918
pipe them up.

184
00:09:56,058 --> 00:09:58,039
I don't know what the genre is for those.

185
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,519
Also great, super satisfying.

186
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,280
And we all clearly kind of arrived

187
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,501
at the same conclusion here, which

188
00:10:05,581 --> 00:10:09,162
is that we wanted to use type to make,

189
00:10:10,702 --> 00:10:12,983
you know, kind of to set the tone of voice of the game

190
00:10:13,143 --> 00:10:16,644
and define our initial interactions with the player.

191
00:10:18,524 --> 00:10:19,985
And that's interesting to me, because there's

192
00:10:20,025 --> 00:10:21,205
two super good reasons.

193
00:10:22,251 --> 00:10:26,974
not to rely heavily on typography in games.

194
00:10:28,015 --> 00:10:29,356
One is that games

195
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:38,023
aren't always the best type.

196
00:10:38,784 --> 00:10:40,705
I don't mean to be mean,

197
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,267
but I was trying to think about games

198
00:10:42,307 --> 00:10:44,408
where I felt strongly about the typography in them,

199
00:10:44,629 --> 00:10:47,411
and it made me think of desktop dungeons.

200
00:10:48,171 --> 00:10:51,174
And desktop dungeons is an absolute masterpiece.

201
00:10:52,372 --> 00:10:54,613
I've put hours and hours and hours and hours and hours into it.

202
00:10:55,294 --> 00:10:55,895
But the, um...

203
00:10:58,537 --> 00:11:02,260
The type in this game is so bad. It's really, really bad.

204
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,221
There's so many... Just look at...

205
00:11:04,361 --> 00:11:08,165
Just keep looking at it and seeing more things you don't like about how...

206
00:11:09,245 --> 00:11:09,366
Oh!

207
00:11:09,886 --> 00:11:11,868
The things that don't line up and things that aren't...

208
00:11:12,048 --> 00:11:13,669
They have to have black outlines because they don't...

209
00:11:13,889 --> 00:11:15,070
Oh! It's... So it's just not...

210
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:16,371
It's... And it's... It's not...

211
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:22,131
Not good because nobody cared, it's because it's hard,

212
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:24,351
because you're asking that kind of content

213
00:11:24,371 --> 00:11:25,932
to do a whole bunch of different things at once,

214
00:11:26,712 --> 00:11:28,112
and you've got a real chance of falling short

215
00:11:28,152 --> 00:11:28,933
somewhere along the way.

216
00:11:29,993 --> 00:11:34,415
And here's the other reason that it's a scary, weird thing

217
00:11:34,435 --> 00:11:35,195
to put your faith in.

218
00:11:36,535 --> 00:11:38,916
It's like the second thing you learn in this job

219
00:11:38,936 --> 00:11:41,177
or whatever species of this job that you have.

220
00:11:41,297 --> 00:11:42,697
Right, people don't read, nobody reads.

221
00:11:44,238 --> 00:11:44,418
And I...

222
00:11:45,723 --> 00:11:47,364
obeyed that rule for a really long time.

223
00:11:49,825 --> 00:11:54,448
But I've now spent enough time in in-house user tests,

224
00:11:54,508 --> 00:11:58,311
watching people play, talking to them after they play,

225
00:11:59,191 --> 00:12:02,073
looking at screens like the ones we just looked at,

226
00:12:02,613 --> 00:12:06,255
that I think I've invented a new variation of the rule, maybe

227
00:12:06,316 --> 00:12:07,096
rule 2.5, which is this.

228
00:12:12,425 --> 00:12:15,346
Writing is probably at the bottom of most players'

229
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:16,767
visual priority list.

230
00:12:17,527 --> 00:12:21,689
If you give them anything else juicier to look at,

231
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:22,729
they're going to look at that.

232
00:12:23,369 --> 00:12:26,170
So the reason that these three screens have all

233
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:29,011
ended up looking so similar is that if you're

234
00:12:29,031 --> 00:12:32,513
going to get this to work, it has to be pretty much

235
00:12:32,533 --> 00:12:33,313
the only game in town.

236
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:37,374
You have to make the text this big, pleasing, eye-catching,

237
00:12:37,895 --> 00:12:41,076
attention-grabber that's going to pull people's attention.

238
00:12:42,431 --> 00:12:44,932
I in and their attention in and then hopefully

239
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:48,193
they will tap the thing with the thing,

240
00:12:48,373 --> 00:12:50,593
which is really all you're ever trying to tell anyone to do.

241
00:12:51,294 --> 00:12:53,354
Please, please tap the thing with the thing.

242
00:12:56,255 --> 00:12:59,616
And that, of all the things I just said

243
00:12:59,656 --> 00:13:01,537
is why it felt like a really good starting point

244
00:13:01,737 --> 00:13:03,137
for things to talk about today.

245
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:06,358
Because type is powerful.

246
00:13:07,321 --> 00:13:08,581
I love how it looks, I want to use it.

247
00:13:09,461 --> 00:13:13,042
If I'm going to use it well, it needs to own the screen.

248
00:13:13,702 --> 00:13:17,443
If it's going to own the screen, I need to make space.

249
00:13:18,663 --> 00:13:20,944
And making space is probably your single biggest job

250
00:13:20,984 --> 00:13:25,445
if you're trying to do good, minimalist user experience

251
00:13:25,465 --> 00:13:26,145
design in games.

252
00:13:26,845 --> 00:13:31,886
You're taking these very, hopefully, beautiful, simple,

253
00:13:31,966 --> 00:13:32,927
refined elements.

254
00:13:33,627 --> 00:13:35,027
You need to give them room to breathe.

255
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:35,627
You need to.

256
00:13:36,669 --> 00:13:39,790
Games can be such cluttered, busy, noisy places.

257
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:44,172
You need to find a way to just push all of that to one side,

258
00:13:45,393 --> 00:13:48,514
find that space and that emptiness, the calm

259
00:13:48,614 --> 00:13:51,816
and the clarity that your design is

260
00:13:51,836 --> 00:13:53,216
going to be able to sit inside.

261
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:56,318
So when I'm trying to get myself in the right frame of mind

262
00:13:56,758 --> 00:14:00,320
to do that job, I look for inspiration

263
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,022
to someone whose work I'm just a huge admirer of.

264
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:09,335
I don't think it'll surprise you to know

265
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:13,318
that I'm thinking of Arnold Schwarzenegger in Predator.

266
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,161
There is a man who knows how to get things done.

267
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:22,966
He's got some good advice for us.

268
00:14:23,006 --> 00:14:23,786
Stay with me on this one,

269
00:14:23,806 --> 00:14:25,047
because it's going to work out.

270
00:14:25,087 --> 00:14:28,890
So, you're in that situation

271
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:33,834
where you are simultaneously trying to defeat

272
00:14:35,077 --> 00:14:39,618
a kind of cyborg alien bounty hunter in the jungle

273
00:14:40,058 --> 00:14:43,819
and overhaul the UI of your minimalist puzzle game,

274
00:14:43,999 --> 00:14:47,460
the first verb that you might need to think about

275
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,020
is hiding.

276
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:54,921
Crucial strategy that I learned from Predator.

277
00:14:56,881 --> 00:14:59,222
It's a really easy tool to make space.

278
00:14:59,242 --> 00:15:00,882
There's a bunch of stuff that is on your screen.

279
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:02,671
It all needs to be on your screen

280
00:15:02,691 --> 00:15:03,371
because it's all important.

281
00:15:03,672 --> 00:15:05,834
Maybe it doesn't all need to be on your screen all the time

282
00:15:05,914 --> 00:15:08,016
because maybe it isn't important at different moments.

283
00:15:08,737 --> 00:15:10,939
So this is the beautiful Mini Metro.

284
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:15,304
I kind of think, right, everyone in this room

285
00:15:15,324 --> 00:15:16,265
must be playing Mini Metro,

286
00:15:16,305 --> 00:15:17,667
otherwise you're in the wrong room.

287
00:15:17,947 --> 00:15:19,509
Who's a Mini Metro person?

288
00:15:21,231 --> 00:15:23,253
Guys, come on.

289
00:15:23,273 --> 00:15:23,593
Super good.

290
00:15:24,528 --> 00:15:26,089
It's maybe extra super good if you lived in London

291
00:15:26,109 --> 00:15:27,690
for a long time, but it's super good.

292
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,991
So this is a very, very simple real-time puzzle game

293
00:15:32,111 --> 00:15:34,512
where you're trying to build and service

294
00:15:34,772 --> 00:15:38,873
a continually growing network of subway stations.

295
00:15:39,974 --> 00:15:41,154
So you have some limited resources

296
00:15:41,194 --> 00:15:44,615
in terms of carriages and lines and trains, bridges.

297
00:15:46,832 --> 00:15:48,994
But you have an ever-growing pile of passengers

298
00:15:50,034 --> 00:15:52,777
and an ever-growing number of stations.

299
00:15:52,837 --> 00:15:55,219
And you need to keep trying to find the best fit solution.

300
00:15:55,659 --> 00:15:57,321
And then the game does gorgeous things

301
00:15:57,381 --> 00:16:00,924
about drawing and routing the train lines that you're

302
00:16:00,944 --> 00:16:06,088
putting in place as if it were as a real beautiful map.

303
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:15,622
And to help you do that well, you can speed up and slow down time, as is often the case in games of this sort.

304
00:16:16,263 --> 00:16:20,785
But they just quietly hide that UI in the top right.

305
00:16:21,485 --> 00:16:26,687
So if you tap on the clock, those controls drop down, then they go away again.

306
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,529
With a really lovely treatment on the clock.

307
00:16:33,109 --> 00:16:35,029
where the clock is doing, the clock is great,

308
00:16:35,069 --> 00:16:37,630
it's a button that's also a status readout

309
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,411
of whether it's day or night,

310
00:16:39,571 --> 00:16:41,432
and it's also your time readout

311
00:16:41,452 --> 00:16:44,553
in terms of how fast time is passing,

312
00:16:45,153 --> 00:16:46,934
and it also shows you whether or not time is paused.

313
00:16:47,394 --> 00:16:49,315
And it does all of that in a lovely little circle

314
00:16:49,755 --> 00:16:51,856
that is also a cute joke about the famous

315
00:16:52,476 --> 00:16:54,437
Swiss railway clock design that

316
00:16:57,688 --> 00:17:00,369
rail design people love to make jokes about.

317
00:17:01,009 --> 00:17:03,530
It's super simple, but this game would feel,

318
00:17:03,671 --> 00:17:04,471
if it loops around again,

319
00:17:04,771 --> 00:17:05,951
this game would feel so different

320
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:10,053
if that whole right-hand wall was just blocked off

321
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:11,314
all the time with all of those icons.

322
00:17:11,374 --> 00:17:14,175
It needs that space to give you that curve

323
00:17:14,275 --> 00:17:15,535
in the top corner so much.

324
00:17:16,996 --> 00:17:19,137
This game has a bunch of really nice tricks up its sleeve.

325
00:17:19,457 --> 00:17:20,637
I haven't got time to talk about them all today,

326
00:17:20,717 --> 00:17:22,618
but the way it handles.

327
00:17:23,922 --> 00:17:25,143
What happens to you when you lose,

328
00:17:25,423 --> 00:17:26,643
which is a thing you'll find out very quickly

329
00:17:26,663 --> 00:17:27,503
when you try it for the first time.

330
00:17:27,703 --> 00:17:28,704
This is really nicely handled.

331
00:17:29,684 --> 00:17:32,605
So, R&E tip number one, hide.

332
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,145
It's a good way of making space.

333
00:17:36,206 --> 00:17:38,226
R&E tip number two, merge.

334
00:17:39,307 --> 00:17:40,007
By which I mean,

335
00:17:42,087 --> 00:17:46,869
you'll remember that the absolute crucial maneuver

336
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:48,509
in Predator was that he discovered

337
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:50,710
if he glooped himself all the way into the mud,

338
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:52,610
then the Predator couldn't see him.

339
00:17:54,081 --> 00:17:55,542
which was at the forefront of my mind

340
00:17:55,582 --> 00:17:56,402
when we were trying to figure out

341
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:59,724
how to do hard currency purchase design for Dotson Co.

342
00:18:00,544 --> 00:18:02,165
So Dotson Co. came out in the middle of last year.

343
00:18:02,365 --> 00:18:05,186
It was the first hard currency game

344
00:18:05,326 --> 00:18:08,808
that the studio had done.

345
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:11,409
And so we spent a bunch of time trying to figure out

346
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:13,250
how to do it well.

347
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:15,571
Oh, I need to go quite fast now.

348
00:18:17,632 --> 00:18:20,893
And to begin with, we were really flailing, I think.

349
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:26,565
A bunch of talented smart people worked really hard on these screens, but I don't think they

350
00:18:26,585 --> 00:18:36,037
would mind me saying that they are suboptimal in a lot of their designs.

351
00:18:36,097 --> 00:18:39,001
The thing on the far left is just so inert and sad.

352
00:18:40,032 --> 00:18:43,674
and playing we try to live in a bit with better illustrations in the middle but

353
00:18:43,714 --> 00:18:47,836
now the whole thing is just super busy the flashes and workers flashes

354
00:18:48,477 --> 00:18:51,579
it's not there is isn't about and everything that is bad

355
00:18:52,099 --> 00:18:54,881
three through it all and started again which is what you have on the far right

356
00:18:55,081 --> 00:18:57,622
and things are getting better but there's still a bunch of

357
00:18:58,002 --> 00:19:00,944
dislocation between what is an interactive

358
00:19:01,344 --> 00:19:01,464
and

359
00:19:02,819 --> 00:19:05,000
It's visually overwhelming, there's too many colors,

360
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,440
everything's tricksy.

361
00:19:07,261 --> 00:19:09,522
And the thing that was holding us back

362
00:19:09,542 --> 00:19:10,462
was we hadn't listened to Warny.

363
00:19:11,903 --> 00:19:12,964
Merging saved us.

364
00:19:13,544 --> 00:19:16,866
So this is pretty much the same content,

365
00:19:18,506 --> 00:19:20,307
but now all of the visual elements are just merged

366
00:19:20,568 --> 00:19:21,588
with the actual button elements.

367
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:24,249
So each of those two pink panels is a giant button.

368
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:29,480
And once we saved ourselves, just the lines,

369
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,281
the physical lines of trying to delineate

370
00:19:31,361 --> 00:19:32,361
all of these different things of like,

371
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:33,662
here's an illustration and here's a button

372
00:19:33,682 --> 00:19:35,123
and here's an informational panel

373
00:19:35,143 --> 00:19:36,123
that's gonna sit next to the button,

374
00:19:36,443 --> 00:19:37,023
was killing us.

375
00:19:37,624 --> 00:19:38,824
You squidge it all into one thing.

376
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:42,706
And it doesn't always feel like a very minimalist instinct

377
00:19:42,786 --> 00:19:43,066
because...

378
00:19:44,615 --> 00:19:45,616
piling things on top of each other

379
00:19:45,636 --> 00:19:46,996
doesn't seem like a minimal idea,

380
00:19:47,596 --> 00:19:48,717
but if they're the right things,

381
00:19:48,757 --> 00:19:50,077
you can kind of collapse space

382
00:19:51,017 --> 00:19:52,658
and they all land neatly on top of each other

383
00:19:52,698 --> 00:19:54,958
and then you can give yourself far more space,

384
00:19:55,098 --> 00:19:56,699
space to actually enjoy those illustrations

385
00:19:57,939 --> 00:20:00,200
and then the clarity to really cut down on that color load,

386
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,040
which is much, much better.

387
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,002
TouchTone does this really nicely as well.

388
00:20:04,022 --> 00:20:06,785
I don't know, I bet fewer people have played TouchTone.

389
00:20:07,645 --> 00:20:08,586
Super nice.

390
00:20:08,706 --> 00:20:13,670
It's like a laser angler reflector game.

391
00:20:14,251 --> 00:20:15,672
Also don't know the genre for that one.

392
00:20:16,393 --> 00:20:19,135
With a super weird sly story

393
00:20:19,155 --> 00:20:22,398
that is gonna feel horribly resonant now

394
00:20:22,438 --> 00:20:23,358
in a way that it didn't before

395
00:20:23,378 --> 00:20:25,400
about the surveillance state.

396
00:20:26,961 --> 00:20:28,843
But they do the super simple thing that their

397
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,101
That color illustration, that thing that's giving you

398
00:20:33,121 --> 00:20:35,882
a sense of being in the city, is the button.

399
00:20:37,022 --> 00:20:37,763
So that's the play button.

400
00:20:38,683 --> 00:20:40,064
And each time you go to a new place,

401
00:20:40,644 --> 00:20:43,285
that's the vision that you have of the new thing.

402
00:20:43,685 --> 00:20:45,186
And it's smart.

403
00:20:45,246 --> 00:20:47,487
It's so simple, it would have taken me forever to see it.

404
00:20:47,567 --> 00:20:49,288
I would have ruined that screen trying

405
00:20:49,308 --> 00:20:52,449
to figure out how to embed the play button around

406
00:20:52,489 --> 00:20:54,290
or on top of the bit of illustration

407
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,731
that I was trying to add to kind of be evocative of how

408
00:20:56,751 --> 00:20:57,891
the thing was going to work.

409
00:21:01,033 --> 00:21:02,053
Hide, merge.

410
00:21:02,994 --> 00:21:07,015
I'm not doing a get to the chopper or any impression

411
00:21:07,035 --> 00:21:09,176
because it's not my strong suit.

412
00:21:09,996 --> 00:21:11,697
But evacuation, key part of a strategy,

413
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:12,757
take the things you don't need

414
00:21:12,817 --> 00:21:15,238
that aren't mission critical, get them out of the way.

415
00:21:15,619 --> 00:21:19,320
Here's another Dotson Co example.

416
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,262
This is like early, we're like midway

417
00:21:23,702 --> 00:21:25,342
on the branding work that we did on Dotson Co.

418
00:21:25,843 --> 00:21:26,783
We'd been a little bit lost

419
00:21:27,823 --> 00:21:28,784
and we were so

420
00:21:30,169 --> 00:21:33,151
pleased to get here to this really strong, simple shape.

421
00:21:33,211 --> 00:21:35,013
There's so much smart thinking in this.

422
00:21:35,654 --> 00:21:38,136
We've got the solid O's in Dots & Co.

423
00:21:38,216 --> 00:21:41,599
or a callback to the two dots logo.

424
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,581
So we had that nice brand cohesion that went through.

425
00:21:44,042 --> 00:21:45,543
The shape of the whole thing reinforces

426
00:21:45,563 --> 00:21:47,105
the shape of the virtual currency object

427
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:48,286
that we have, which is a token.

428
00:21:48,966 --> 00:21:52,229
The compass motif in the top was then an element

429
00:21:52,249 --> 00:21:53,390
that we were gonna be able to repeat

430
00:21:53,491 --> 00:21:54,151
in a whole bunch of...

431
00:21:55,852 --> 00:21:57,714
like narrative settings elsewhere in the game

432
00:21:57,734 --> 00:21:58,494
that we were kind of building out

433
00:21:58,514 --> 00:22:00,316
this little adventure club idea around it.

434
00:22:00,856 --> 00:22:03,138
The needle in the middle of the compass

435
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:05,059
is the shape of the special triangular dot

436
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:06,280
that is invented in Dots & Co.

437
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:09,263
It's genius, it's just so,

438
00:22:09,383 --> 00:22:11,604
it's so much smart thinking has gone into that.

439
00:22:19,758 --> 00:22:22,964
So we killed it, because it was so busy being clever,

440
00:22:22,985 --> 00:22:23,646
it wasn't any good.

441
00:22:25,349 --> 00:22:27,554
Because it was just too much, it was far, far, far too much.

442
00:22:28,215 --> 00:22:31,281
So despite the fact that we had a bunch of good.

443
00:22:33,344 --> 00:22:34,445
strategic thought behind it.

444
00:22:34,505 --> 00:22:35,846
It just wasn't adding up to anything

445
00:22:35,906 --> 00:22:38,527
that really captured the spirit of what we were trying to do.

446
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,388
So what you're seeing on the right

447
00:22:40,448 --> 00:22:42,470
is basically the current login screen.

448
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:44,871
The map behind it changes depending

449
00:22:44,891 --> 00:22:45,671
on where you are in the world.

450
00:22:45,691 --> 00:22:47,953
So that's constantly evolving.

451
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,915
But that and the Facebook button, if you're not logged in,

452
00:22:50,955 --> 00:22:52,235
is the only screen for it that we have.

453
00:22:52,295 --> 00:22:56,398
And we ended up going with this incredibly typographic approach

454
00:22:56,418 --> 00:22:58,839
for the logo because it was just the most bang for buck.

455
00:22:59,099 --> 00:23:01,341
It was the biggest impact that we could have with the least.

456
00:23:02,455 --> 00:23:04,257
detail that got in the way of us doing anything else.

457
00:23:05,418 --> 00:23:06,339
So we threw that stuff out.

458
00:23:06,899 --> 00:23:07,900
Sometimes it's stuff we didn't,

459
00:23:08,081 --> 00:23:09,903
we threw out that we didn't even realize that we threw out.

460
00:23:10,123 --> 00:23:12,465
So this is also a Dotson Co screenshot.

461
00:23:15,148 --> 00:23:16,610
Every now and again, our games get cloned.

462
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:19,072
And so you get strange situations where

463
00:23:19,412 --> 00:23:20,834
somebody will put a game in the app store

464
00:23:21,355 --> 00:23:24,278
with just like screenshots stolen from your app store.

465
00:23:25,398 --> 00:23:28,581
but then in a weird effort to try and make it,

466
00:23:28,882 --> 00:23:30,923
I don't know why, but in a weird effort,

467
00:23:30,943 --> 00:23:32,605
they sometimes change the screenshots a bit

468
00:23:32,725 --> 00:23:34,947
to try and disguise the fact that they've stolen them.

469
00:23:35,507 --> 00:23:36,448
So we found this the other day,

470
00:23:36,468 --> 00:23:38,090
and initially all we could notice

471
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:39,311
was that basically what they'd done

472
00:23:39,371 --> 00:23:40,331
was it looked like they'd taken

473
00:23:40,932 --> 00:23:42,433
one of the characters from MuJo

474
00:23:42,453 --> 00:23:45,916
and stuck it on top of our companion.

475
00:23:46,016 --> 00:23:49,479
Now MuJo, side note, is an iOS game

476
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:51,001
made by these guys, Oink Games.

477
00:23:52,867 --> 00:23:55,488
I think their digital work is really good.

478
00:23:55,588 --> 00:23:59,851
I think their paper and tabletop work is spectacular.

479
00:24:00,871 --> 00:24:03,393
They make basically, I think, the coolest looking tabletop

480
00:24:03,433 --> 00:24:05,434
and board games anywhere in the world right now.

481
00:24:05,454 --> 00:24:07,676
I love their stuff so much.

482
00:24:07,756 --> 00:24:09,717
You should go and follow them on Twitter.

483
00:24:11,238 --> 00:24:12,158
So yeah, it was weird.

484
00:24:12,178 --> 00:24:13,579
It was like somebody just pulled out a bit of their art

485
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:14,500
and stuck it on top of ours.

486
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,420
And that distracted us for a bit.

487
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,923
And it distracted us for so long that we didn't notice this.

488
00:24:20,363 --> 00:24:21,464
But the other thing they'd done.

489
00:24:23,758 --> 00:24:25,800
was they put eyes on the turtles.

490
00:24:29,522 --> 00:24:31,444
And that was really interesting because we'd never

491
00:24:31,904 --> 00:24:33,145
thought about putting eyes on the turtles.

492
00:24:33,325 --> 00:24:35,406
And now we realize that it was right

493
00:24:35,447 --> 00:24:38,188
because it's weird and terrible and they don't need eyes.

494
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:42,571
And it's a kind of useful question

495
00:24:42,631 --> 00:24:43,332
as to whether or not we should.

496
00:24:44,495 --> 00:24:45,796
Give me a different perspective on the concept

497
00:24:45,836 --> 00:24:48,377
of feature culling when we start asking

498
00:24:48,417 --> 00:24:49,998
whether or not things needed eyes or noses.

499
00:24:50,819 --> 00:24:51,980
This is another good example of that.

500
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:55,062
This is Reigns, which again you should play if you haven't.

501
00:24:55,142 --> 00:24:56,423
It's a super cute like.

502
00:24:58,326 --> 00:25:02,188
lightweight choice based RPG, you're the king of a country

503
00:25:02,348 --> 00:25:05,630
and advisors come to you and get over and over and over

504
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:07,931
with a simple question and you make a binary choice,

505
00:25:08,091 --> 00:25:10,953
left or right, and then your country prospers

506
00:25:11,013 --> 00:25:12,854
or doesn't accordingly.

507
00:25:13,835 --> 00:25:17,096
This is the Archbishop of Kotaburi, not Canterbury,

508
00:25:17,697 --> 00:25:18,477
have to say that carefully.

509
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:25,702
He doesn't have a nose or a mouth, poor Archbishop.

510
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,543
And that made me wonder, maybe he doesn't need eyes.

511
00:25:29,823 --> 00:25:30,984
If turtles don't need eyes,

512
00:25:31,064 --> 00:25:32,686
why do archbishops need eyes?

513
00:25:33,486 --> 00:25:36,369
And I think it's a really interesting thing,

514
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:37,329
which is he does need eyes,

515
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:40,852
because he still reads as a human character right now.

516
00:25:40,952 --> 00:25:44,055
He still probably even reads as an archbishop,

517
00:25:44,975 --> 00:25:45,236
but

518
00:25:47,176 --> 00:25:49,758
Without the eyes, you lose that sense of connection

519
00:25:49,818 --> 00:25:55,403
and you lose that sense of his snarky, untrustworthy frame

520
00:25:55,443 --> 00:25:55,784
of mind.

521
00:25:57,505 --> 00:25:59,747
And so that, as you're evacuating all of the stuff

522
00:25:59,787 --> 00:26:01,208
out of your game that you think you don't need,

523
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:02,990
that's.

524
00:26:04,984 --> 00:26:07,265
definitely a way to be on, you know,

525
00:26:08,105 --> 00:26:10,226
the need is to watch out for have you gone too far.

526
00:26:10,246 --> 00:26:11,367
The turtles don't need eyes,

527
00:26:11,387 --> 00:26:12,987
because the eyes aren't helping,

528
00:26:13,327 --> 00:26:14,468
but they do need to be turtles,

529
00:26:14,968 --> 00:26:17,849
because them being turtles tells you a huge amount

530
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:20,070
about what to expect out of them as game objects.

531
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,711
They move on their own.

532
00:26:21,971 --> 00:26:22,951
They go into their shells.

533
00:26:22,991 --> 00:26:24,512
When you hit them, they come back out of their shells

534
00:26:24,652 --> 00:26:25,192
after you hit them.

535
00:26:25,892 --> 00:26:27,513
A turtle is a hell of a way to communicate.

536
00:26:27,613 --> 00:26:29,574
What would otherwise be the world's biggest tool tip

537
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:30,654
to take you through all of that?

538
00:26:31,014 --> 00:26:32,715
So they don't need eyes, but they do need to be turtles.

539
00:26:34,215 --> 00:26:35,776
He does need eyes, but he doesn't need a nose.

540
00:26:36,016 --> 00:26:36,496
Any questions?

541
00:26:37,197 --> 00:26:38,057
Archbishop's nose.

542
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:38,697
Okay, perfect.

543
00:26:39,337 --> 00:26:42,599
Also, if you're obeying your irony rules,

544
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:45,240
look at the nice merge they've done in the top of the UI.

545
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:50,622
So the four icons are kind of the four different estates.

546
00:26:52,788 --> 00:26:54,949
the church, the army, the coffers.

547
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:58,271
Each time you make a choice, they're impacted.

548
00:27:00,132 --> 00:27:03,034
And the degree to which they're impacted

549
00:27:03,294 --> 00:27:06,556
is shown by the size of the change

550
00:27:06,736 --> 00:27:08,337
and the nature of the change

551
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:09,458
is shown by the color of the change.

552
00:27:09,498 --> 00:27:11,359
So green means better and red means worse.

553
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,881
And then the icons represent the things themselves.

554
00:27:14,681 --> 00:27:15,562
And it's just super great.

555
00:27:15,582 --> 00:27:16,602
They could have garbage that up

556
00:27:16,642 --> 00:27:18,664
with a ton of like bars and texts

557
00:27:18,704 --> 00:27:19,824
and a whole bunch of things,

558
00:27:19,864 --> 00:27:21,605
but they found a really, really simple way to do it.

559
00:27:23,474 --> 00:27:29,416
Orny, hide, merge, evacuate, you'll recall, kill.

560
00:27:29,456 --> 00:27:30,777
Last, I think, Dotson Co. example,

561
00:27:30,817 --> 00:27:32,637
just because I know a lot about it.

562
00:27:33,038 --> 00:27:36,059
This was the original character select screen.

563
00:27:37,179 --> 00:27:39,080
In Dotson Co., you have a little companion

564
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,061
who goes with you into the game and helps you out each level.

565
00:27:41,841 --> 00:27:44,322
The original concept was that you would have

566
00:27:44,582 --> 00:27:47,463
a rookie and an expert companion available each level.

567
00:27:48,063 --> 00:27:50,784
The rookie was free, the expert cost hard currency,

568
00:27:50,824 --> 00:27:51,805
but was more powerful.

569
00:27:54,586 --> 00:28:02,929
And we put a ton of work into finding the right way to make this choice clean.

570
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:11,052
And we stuck button upon button upon button and tried swiping paradigm upon swiping paradigm.

571
00:28:12,332 --> 00:28:17,314
Just got into a situation where we could, you know, you were, you were.

572
00:28:18,235 --> 00:28:19,456
chasing your tail, you would fix this problem

573
00:28:19,476 --> 00:28:20,956
and then cause a new problem and run and run and run.

574
00:28:20,976 --> 00:28:21,296
You would go.

575
00:28:21,957 --> 00:28:24,477
And where we ended up was here.

576
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:31,239
So it's the same mono button solution.

577
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:36,441
So again, rather than having to navigate button

578
00:28:36,501 --> 00:28:38,762
plus illustrative element plus informational element,

579
00:28:39,282 --> 00:28:40,162
everything's bundled together.

580
00:28:41,311 --> 00:28:42,472
But the other thing you'll notice

581
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:43,613
is we basically killed the feature.

582
00:28:43,853 --> 00:28:46,435
This is a different take on the same feature.

583
00:28:46,495 --> 00:28:48,856
So there's still an option to make a hard currency

584
00:28:48,876 --> 00:28:51,078
purchase to up your chances of beating the level.

585
00:28:51,518 --> 00:28:53,059
But we lost the idea that there would

586
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:55,181
be two separate characters that you were choosing between,

587
00:28:55,581 --> 00:28:58,203
because it was just too much of an information

588
00:28:58,243 --> 00:29:00,024
burden at a moment in the game where

589
00:29:00,044 --> 00:29:03,707
you want things to be smooth and fast and about anticipation.

590
00:29:05,208 --> 00:29:08,370
So we killed the, well, we didn't kill the penguin,

591
00:29:08,971 --> 00:29:09,931
but sort of.

592
00:29:10,492 --> 00:29:10,932
Sorry, Anita.

593
00:29:11,764 --> 00:29:12,424
She's wearing a scarf.

594
00:29:13,945 --> 00:29:15,446
OK, I'm definitely over time, so these

595
00:29:15,486 --> 00:29:16,526
are going to go crazy fast.

596
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:19,688
Orny wouldn't be Orny without some kind of secret weapon.

597
00:29:19,728 --> 00:29:20,708
This is our secret weapon.

598
00:29:21,149 --> 00:29:22,449
I can't recommend this strongly enough.

599
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:28,012
Everything we make is 100% colorblind playable.

600
00:29:30,373 --> 00:29:32,274
And it's an enormous amount of work.

601
00:29:32,994 --> 00:29:34,535
And it's prodigiously worthwhile.

602
00:29:36,036 --> 00:29:39,998
So this is a pretty complex Docks and Coast screen.

603
00:29:40,853 --> 00:29:41,874
We've got a bunch of stuff going on.

604
00:29:41,914 --> 00:29:44,815
We've got dots that explode into squares.

605
00:29:44,855 --> 00:29:46,616
We've got dots that auto-connect to other dots.

606
00:29:46,656 --> 00:29:48,898
We've got dots that auto-connect to other dots that are inside.

607
00:29:49,458 --> 00:29:50,858
Dots that only open when you match next to them.

608
00:29:50,879 --> 00:29:51,999
And there's balloons that are going up

609
00:29:52,019 --> 00:29:52,839
to the top of the screen.

610
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,820
There's panels that change the color

611
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,861
of dots that fall into them.

612
00:29:58,242 --> 00:30:02,384
It's all moderately overwhelming from a design perspective

613
00:30:03,245 --> 00:30:04,165
if you're just playing.

614
00:30:04,205 --> 00:30:07,547
But if you turn colorblind on, now all of that

615
00:30:07,587 --> 00:30:10,248
has to function successfully.

616
00:30:12,284 --> 00:30:14,909
with the shape system that we have on top of that.

617
00:30:14,949 --> 00:30:16,552
And every single mechanic that we put in the game,

618
00:30:16,692 --> 00:30:19,498
even if it seems like we don't know how to do it,

619
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:21,541
we won't put in unless we can make colorblind work.

620
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,042
And we do that because it's nice.

621
00:30:25,462 --> 00:30:27,544
You wouldn't believe how many letters we get from people.

622
00:30:27,564 --> 00:30:28,865
You wouldn't believe how many people

623
00:30:28,925 --> 00:30:30,085
don't think they're colorblind,

624
00:30:30,145 --> 00:30:31,486
but still find it incredibly useful

625
00:30:31,567 --> 00:30:33,088
to have that kind of facility within a game.

626
00:30:33,408 --> 00:30:34,289
Super, super worthwhile.

627
00:30:34,869 --> 00:30:37,311
It's an incredibly good discipline for us as designers.

628
00:30:40,533 --> 00:30:44,156
It just forces you to be incredibly restrained

629
00:30:44,196 --> 00:30:46,518
and precise in how you work.

630
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:47,198
And...

631
00:30:49,907 --> 00:30:53,008
Because you figured out all of your colorblind design

632
00:30:53,028 --> 00:30:55,549
at a formal level, it gives you the freedom

633
00:30:55,569 --> 00:30:57,270
to do whatever the hell you want with color anywhere else.

634
00:30:57,390 --> 00:31:00,951
And that maybe is the thing that is the most vital tool

635
00:31:00,991 --> 00:31:02,851
in our toolbox for doing good minimal design,

636
00:31:03,251 --> 00:31:07,352
which is that we invest a wildly high proportion

637
00:31:07,372 --> 00:31:08,913
of our energy into color.

638
00:31:09,933 --> 00:31:12,594
So we redo the palette of the game.

639
00:31:14,144 --> 00:31:17,026
Every, this is two dots so far,

640
00:31:17,206 --> 00:31:18,227
Dots & Co also does this.

641
00:31:20,028 --> 00:31:23,070
It's a huge amount of work to settle on those palettes

642
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,811
and then make sure everything works against everything else.

643
00:31:25,191 --> 00:31:27,633
It's unbelievably worthwhile because it is a way

644
00:31:27,673 --> 00:31:30,775
of giving the game a sense of richness and luxury

645
00:31:31,696 --> 00:31:34,658
without adding detail or texture or complex illustration.

646
00:31:36,619 --> 00:31:40,541
And so that kind of double whammy of using colorblind

647
00:31:40,581 --> 00:31:41,922
as an opportunity to make sure that our designs

648
00:31:41,962 --> 00:31:43,263
are really, really, really restrained.

649
00:31:43,777 --> 00:31:47,240
and then being able to do things with color was fantastic.

650
00:31:48,861 --> 00:31:51,983
I got one thing that's cooler than rainbow ink.

651
00:31:55,286 --> 00:31:58,268
Invisible ink.

652
00:31:59,569 --> 00:32:01,170
These are the design elements that we use

653
00:32:02,772 --> 00:32:04,233
to make our minimal design work

654
00:32:04,253 --> 00:32:05,233
that don't show up on screen.

655
00:32:06,735 --> 00:32:07,735
This is the biggest one.

656
00:32:09,377 --> 00:32:09,917
Music and sound.

657
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:13,091
If you're trying to do minimal design

658
00:32:13,151 --> 00:32:15,731
and you're not including these as a cornerstone

659
00:32:15,791 --> 00:32:16,832
of how your design is gonna work,

660
00:32:16,872 --> 00:32:19,452
you're making life way harder for yourself

661
00:32:19,472 --> 00:32:20,132
than it needs to be.

662
00:32:21,413 --> 00:32:25,474
We're unbelievably reliant on how smart our sound team are

663
00:32:26,534 --> 00:32:28,875
for supporting the work that we try and do

664
00:32:28,915 --> 00:32:31,035
in terms of the aesthetic that we're trying to hit.

665
00:32:31,515 --> 00:32:35,336
And then that also goes for things like vibration.

666
00:32:35,616 --> 00:32:36,117
Did that buzz?

667
00:32:39,205 --> 00:32:44,960
Yeah, one of the best bits of visual design we have in the game is that when you make a square, it buzzes.

668
00:32:46,077 --> 00:32:47,757
And because it buzzes, we don't have to do anything else.

669
00:32:48,058 --> 00:32:48,978
We actually do do some other things,

670
00:32:49,018 --> 00:32:50,559
but we have to do so much less

671
00:32:50,639 --> 00:32:51,839
because we have that vibration in there.

672
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,481
So when you're hitting a ceiling visually,

673
00:32:55,501 --> 00:32:57,102
you're like, there's more I need to communicate,

674
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:58,303
but my screen's getting too busy,

675
00:32:58,343 --> 00:33:00,924
this thing's starting to feel noisy and not minimal enough,

676
00:33:01,284 --> 00:33:03,125
remember that you have other tools at your disposal

677
00:33:03,145 --> 00:33:03,825
that aren't visual.

678
00:33:04,386 --> 00:33:05,926
Because I think that's the thing

679
00:33:05,946 --> 00:33:07,147
that I've been most conscious of

680
00:33:07,307 --> 00:33:09,308
coming to work at this company.

681
00:33:10,649 --> 00:33:11,729
We're 50 people now.

682
00:33:11,749 --> 00:33:11,809
And...

683
00:33:15,472 --> 00:33:18,874
If everyone doesn't buy into the virtue

684
00:33:18,894 --> 00:33:21,996
of a minimal aesthetic, you're gonna have

685
00:33:22,036 --> 00:33:23,436
a really hard time holding onto it,

686
00:33:23,557 --> 00:33:25,198
especially in a commercial setting.

687
00:33:26,779 --> 00:33:27,979
Minimalist is fragile.

688
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:29,600
You can ruin it real quick just by sticking

689
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,062
an extra button in there, or a new texture,

690
00:33:32,122 --> 00:33:34,283
or a dumb keynote animation transition

691
00:33:34,323 --> 00:33:34,863
that I should.

692
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,481
not use but I can't resist.

693
00:33:38,121 --> 00:33:41,604
You need everybody to be invested in keeping things clear

694
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:42,545
and keeping things clean,

695
00:33:42,945 --> 00:33:44,406
in figuring out how their discipline,

696
00:33:44,426 --> 00:33:46,788
whether they're game designers or product managers

697
00:33:46,808 --> 00:33:49,870
or musicians or whatever else they do,

698
00:33:50,971 --> 00:33:55,154
can hold the line and let the work stay clean and beautiful

699
00:33:55,995 --> 00:33:56,575
as you want it to be.
