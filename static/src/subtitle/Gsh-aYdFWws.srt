1
00:00:06,077 --> 00:00:06,721
Good evening.

2
00:00:06,721 --> 00:00:08,831
Little humbled by the turnout.

3
00:00:08,831 --> 00:00:10,178
It's nice to see everyone.

4
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:13,672
I did want to take a moment and just say thank you to everybody

5
00:00:13,672 --> 00:00:17,735
who, um, you know, has come. It's... I know it's late. I know

6
00:00:17,735 --> 00:00:20,537
you're probably looking forward to beer and or dinner and or

7
00:00:20,537 --> 00:00:25,261
both. Um, so I will try to keep it tight and keep it fresh. And

8
00:00:25,261 --> 00:00:28,283
then, uh, I anticipate based on the length of my talk I'm

9
00:00:28,283 --> 00:00:30,404
probably not going to have a ton of time for questions, so I will

10
00:00:30,404 --> 00:00:33,507
commit to being out in one of the kind of follow-up rooms if

11
00:00:33,507 --> 00:00:37,389
you do want to talk or... I have a standing rule. I had, uh, I've

12
00:00:37,389 --> 00:00:40,391
already had one. If people have anything they need signed.

13
00:00:40,792 --> 00:00:45,553
anything at all. You just let me know. Um, uh, I did get a signed

14
00:00:45,553 --> 00:00:48,014
copy of Inquisition today, which is really cool. So, um, I do

15
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:52,175
wanna say thank you as well to the Nerve Summit. I, I really

16
00:00:52,175 --> 00:00:55,956
appreciate the invite. It was amazing to come here. Of course

17
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:58,776
GDC in general, uh, it's a pleasure. I haven't been in a

18
00:00:58,776 --> 00:01:01,657
few years, uh, I had kind of a standing policy that I would

19
00:01:01,657 --> 00:01:04,698
tend to send more junior members of my team, cause I felt like

20
00:01:04,698 --> 00:01:06,378
they could learn a lot by coming here, so.

21
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:10,799
Now that I don't have a team, I thought, well, I guess I'm sending me.

22
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,766
So I want to talk about trust.

23
00:01:16,766 --> 00:01:20,631
That's going to be the kind of theme that ties my talk together.

24
00:01:20,631 --> 00:01:25,476
And for those of you who don't know who I am, because, you know, Tom's, that was a pretty

25
00:01:25,476 --> 00:01:26,357
weak introduction.

26
00:01:29,725 --> 00:01:35,129
by demand. So I used to work with Bioware. I was there for 14 years. I used to say I'd

27
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:39,872
been there. But I was there for 14 years. I worked on Jade Empire. I had the distinct

28
00:01:39,872 --> 00:01:44,695
honor of writing all the subspecies for Mass Effect. I got to write the first Volus, the

29
00:01:44,695 --> 00:01:46,916
first Elcor, and the first Hanar. That was pretty cool.

30
00:01:47,771 --> 00:01:51,194
And then I worked on all of the Dragon Ages.

31
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:55,857
I took over as lead design in the last couple of years of Origins and worked on Awakenings

32
00:01:55,857 --> 00:01:57,458
and II and Inquisition.

33
00:01:57,458 --> 00:01:59,420
So I have a bit of a history.

34
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:05,804
And what I want to talk to you about today is not kind of the basics.

35
00:02:05,804 --> 00:02:08,987
I want to talk to you about what I see, you know, speaking as someone who's been a creative

36
00:02:08,987 --> 00:02:09,387
director.

37
00:02:11,002 --> 00:02:13,343
in terms of high-functioning writing teams.

38
00:02:13,343 --> 00:02:15,505
And that team doesn't have to be multiple people.

39
00:02:15,505 --> 00:02:18,287
It could be just you as the writer involved

40
00:02:18,287 --> 00:02:20,369
in a specific set of exercises.

41
00:02:20,369 --> 00:02:23,491
And the key thing you need to do

42
00:02:23,491 --> 00:02:26,113
is to establish trust with the team.

43
00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:29,996
And my job was, of course, to help the writers get there.

44
00:02:29,996 --> 00:02:31,657
And the reason for that

45
00:02:31,657 --> 00:02:33,058
is because people have a misconception.

46
00:02:34,263 --> 00:02:38,284
This may be a slide specifically designed to appeal to writers.

47
00:02:38,284 --> 00:02:40,824
But the simple truth is that putting sentences together

48
00:02:40,824 --> 00:02:42,224
is not the same as writing.

49
00:02:42,224 --> 00:02:43,985
It does not evoke emotion.

50
00:02:43,985 --> 00:02:45,585
It does not tell a story.

51
00:02:45,585 --> 00:02:48,886
It does not make you feel.

52
00:02:48,886 --> 00:02:51,126
And your job, if you're here at the Narrative Summit,

53
00:02:51,126 --> 00:02:54,547
I imagine, is either to feel or to figure out

54
00:02:54,547 --> 00:02:58,568
how people whose job it is to make people feel work.

55
00:02:58,568 --> 00:03:00,708
So I'm here to help you with that.

56
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:02,308
I think that.

57
00:03:02,647 --> 00:03:09,069
these are distinct skills and ones that the team may think they already have.

58
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:14,272
And you as writers are possessing of some sort of secret mystery that unfortunately

59
00:03:14,272 --> 00:03:20,734
does not have the mystique of sculpting in 3D or coding really tight arrays or that kind

60
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:21,615
of thing.

61
00:03:21,615 --> 00:03:25,976
So then, how do you earn the trust of a team?

62
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:28,590
It's interesting.

63
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:31,653
And the thing is, your job is to win their hearts and minds.

64
00:03:31,653 --> 00:03:34,035
And I think there's three critical things that

65
00:03:34,035 --> 00:03:35,236
will help you do that.

66
00:03:35,236 --> 00:03:39,620
The first is a schedule that understands and can survive

67
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,021
the rigors of development.

68
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:43,323
You need to be realistic about how much time you have

69
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:44,724
and what work you can do.

70
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:45,104
OK, cool.

71
00:03:45,104 --> 00:03:47,647
A schedule that understands rigors of development.

72
00:03:47,647 --> 00:03:48,027
Here we go.

73
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:48,287
Boom.

74
00:03:48,287 --> 00:03:50,829
A story with clearly articulated goals.

75
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:51,170
Right?

76
00:03:52,495 --> 00:03:56,917
What you may find is that your team does not immediately understand your genius.

77
00:03:56,917 --> 00:03:58,178
So how do you communicate that?

78
00:03:58,178 --> 00:04:03,700
And thirdly, you need to have processes in place if you want to be truly successful

79
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,681
to help the team understand that you are committed to quality.

80
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:12,608
Because writing can be weirdly, weirdly non-transparent about this.

81
00:04:12,608 --> 00:04:16,150
Because again, everybody kind of thinks they understand how it works, but they don't.

82
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:19,952
So, my job, as I see it, is to come here and say,

83
00:04:19,952 --> 00:04:23,014
okay, I've led writing teams, I've been on writing teams,

84
00:04:23,014 --> 00:04:24,895
can I help you take one step further?

85
00:04:24,895 --> 00:04:32,060
And we're going to start with the oh-so-exciting subject of schedule.

86
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,541
Properly pronounced.

87
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,062
Asphalt.

88
00:04:35,812 --> 00:04:41,555
So the thing about scheduling is that I'm going to take some givens.

89
00:04:41,555 --> 00:04:47,137
I think that either you are already highly competent or you've attended enough of the

90
00:04:47,137 --> 00:04:52,679
well-paced and carefully curated narrative summit that you will be exceptionally competent

91
00:04:52,679 --> 00:04:54,880
by the time you finish your time here.

92
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,361
And so you know how to track the velocity of your team.

93
00:04:58,276 --> 00:05:01,739
you know how much work you have to do, you know, okay, we're going to write, you know,

94
00:05:01,739 --> 00:05:07,163
400,000 words or some business like that. And you know how long you have. And as soon as you know

95
00:05:07,163 --> 00:05:11,947
all those things, in theory, you can make a schedule. But the problem is, is that the real

96
00:05:11,947 --> 00:05:19,233
schedule exists in service to downstream teams. And this I find, especially when you're starting

97
00:05:19,233 --> 00:05:25,478
out, is something you don't think about. A writer can casually write and then the universe explodes.

98
00:05:25,478 --> 00:05:27,560
And it turns out that's very hard to render.

99
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:34,478
Downstream teams have to figure out how to take the work that you're doing and turn them into actuality

100
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:36,779
Unless it is a hundred percent reliant on words

101
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:42,824
If you are working in a text parser and are making an infocomm style interactive fiction game

102
00:05:42,824 --> 00:05:46,046
You may leave because none of my stuff will apply you are actually golden

103
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:47,767
You may do whatever you like

104
00:05:47,767 --> 00:05:54,472
But the thing is is that downstream teams in anything beyond that do have an impact on the amount of time you have

105
00:05:54,472 --> 00:05:59,375
And you look at your schedule and go while we start production then we finish production. I'm great. Things are amazing

106
00:06:00,617 --> 00:06:05,820
And I couldn't have paid for a more beautifully timed laugh.

107
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:10,543
Because the simple truth is that's never the case.

108
00:06:10,543 --> 00:06:12,284
In fact, what you'll find is that there

109
00:06:12,284 --> 00:06:14,625
are any number of downstream departments who have

110
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:15,826
this kind of stack dependency.

111
00:06:15,826 --> 00:06:19,368
Editing was something that we had a separate department

112
00:06:19,368 --> 00:06:20,048
for at BioWare.

113
00:06:20,048 --> 00:06:21,089
Maybe you don't have that.

114
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,870
But you should look at editors, or you

115
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,451
have to do the work yourself.

116
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:25,972
That's going to eat some of your time.

117
00:06:26,867 --> 00:06:30,829
there will be, if you choose to pursue voice, there will be voiceover recording.

118
00:06:30,829 --> 00:06:34,271
That will be a significant drag on the amount of time that you have.

119
00:06:34,271 --> 00:06:38,413
Cinematics, of course, usually have a dependency on voiceover.

120
00:06:38,413 --> 00:06:41,475
If you're going to record stuff or do performance capture or anything like that,

121
00:06:41,475 --> 00:06:44,177
the cinematics team cannot begin until they have the text written.

122
00:06:44,797 --> 00:06:47,780
and then they tweak the cameras and other movement like that.

123
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:51,543
And then for us, we would localize into 12 to 15 languages,

124
00:06:51,543 --> 00:06:53,946
so we'd have to translate it, then we'd have to record that,

125
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:58,149
and then all of that has to go through QA,

126
00:06:58,149 --> 00:06:59,291
because we would sim-ship.

127
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:01,873
Now, there may be things that you're able to move,

128
00:07:01,873 --> 00:07:04,575
there may be things you're able to shift around,

129
00:07:04,575 --> 00:07:07,478
but my point is, more than anything else,

130
00:07:08,126 --> 00:07:14,091
is that your job is to understand how many factors live downstream of the work that you do.

131
00:07:14,091 --> 00:07:22,058
Because the real time that you have as compared to this wonderful magical blue polygon is

132
00:07:22,058 --> 00:07:26,603
significantly shortened by the amount of dependency. Because even if you can parallelize,

133
00:07:26,603 --> 00:07:31,927
which again we managed to do, this represents a BioWare schedule, but to do that require numerous

134
00:07:31,927 --> 00:07:33,869
producers coordinating the

135
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:38,492
elements moving through if you can parallelize even then there is a

136
00:07:38,492 --> 00:07:42,916
Final piece of writing that you do that must still go through a pipeline where it touches vo and editing

137
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:49,601
Now there are ways to mitigate the amount of time that you lose in the course of this process, which is good

138
00:07:49,601 --> 00:07:51,582
That's absolutely good news

139
00:07:51,582 --> 00:07:56,666
And again, I want to kind of share the stuff that we did to accelerate our writers to give them more time a little more

140
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,848
leeway the first thing is

141
00:07:58,848 --> 00:08:03,571
Cinematics and performance capture anything that had that level of dependency had to be written

142
00:08:04,292 --> 00:08:06,654
first or as early as was practical.

143
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:08,595
Sometimes you need to get the character voice,

144
00:08:08,595 --> 00:08:10,496
sometimes you need a core plot in place,

145
00:08:10,496 --> 00:08:13,158
but as soon as you could do this, the sooner you had it

146
00:08:13,158 --> 00:08:15,420
because you want it to be early in the stream

147
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,380
for parallelization.

148
00:08:18,162 --> 00:08:21,063
Major characters should have, at minimum,

149
00:08:21,063 --> 00:08:24,644
one significant piece of content written as early as you can

150
00:08:24,644 --> 00:08:26,625
if you are doing voiceover.

151
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:28,065
Doubly so if you're doing performance capture.

152
00:08:28,065 --> 00:08:30,406
And the reason I bring that up is because

153
00:08:30,406 --> 00:08:33,868
they may not actually be the right actors.

154
00:08:33,868 --> 00:08:35,528
And if you don't have the right actors,

155
00:08:35,528 --> 00:08:37,889
they simply can't hit the notes you need

156
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:39,790
for a specific character.

157
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:42,471
You need to recast them, which is time that you will lose.

158
00:08:42,471 --> 00:08:45,832
The sooner you can collapse that waveform into a particle,

159
00:08:46,764 --> 00:08:49,719
and turn it into reality, the better your production will go.

160
00:08:52,059 --> 00:08:57,242
If you can, and if you are localizing your game, which I understand not everyone will do, but, you know,

161
00:08:57,242 --> 00:08:59,863
30% of Dragon Age's sales were due to localization.

162
00:08:59,863 --> 00:09:02,784
That's significant. Millions of copies.

163
00:09:02,784 --> 00:09:09,027
If you can sit down with your translation team and help them to understand the why of your game,

164
00:09:09,027 --> 00:09:14,290
and the purpose of your character, and understand intuitively why they sound the way they sound.

165
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:20,793
Iron Bull is using humor to cover his deep dissatisfaction with his current state.

166
00:09:21,753 --> 00:09:27,138
Oh, well that makes every translation easier because they understand the core fundamentals

167
00:09:27,138 --> 00:09:28,139
and principles.

168
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:31,842
We would have our writers get on to phone calls in ridiculously early hours because

169
00:09:31,842 --> 00:09:36,166
our translation teams were in Madrid, and they would sit them down and go, okay, cool,

170
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,808
let me talk to you about what Sarah means.

171
00:09:37,808 --> 00:09:42,252
She doesn't make any sense, and you're going to have to translate a bunch of dick jokes.

172
00:09:42,252 --> 00:09:42,993
Good luck.

173
00:09:42,993 --> 00:09:43,413
And if you can.

174
00:09:47,072 --> 00:09:50,273
If you want to reduce the amount of rework you can do,

175
00:09:50,273 --> 00:09:53,894
a thing that we invested in very early was having engineers

176
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:58,196
create a live and aware set of data complements that said,

177
00:09:58,196 --> 00:10:02,838
if this thing has been translated or recorded, change its state.

178
00:10:02,838 --> 00:10:06,139
If I looked in the dialog tool set that BioWare used,

179
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:08,380
dialog lines that were yellow or red

180
00:10:08,747 --> 00:10:11,889
were ones that had already gone down the pipe.

181
00:10:11,889 --> 00:10:15,032
Money had been spent to translate them or record them.

182
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:17,895
If I were to change those, I was aware

183
00:10:17,895 --> 00:10:19,857
that that had additional cost.

184
00:10:19,857 --> 00:10:20,838
It didn't mean I couldn't.

185
00:10:21,763 --> 00:10:24,605
But it meant that I should do so only when it was absolutely necessary.

186
00:10:24,605 --> 00:10:27,866
And we had a whole process in which change requests would be put through.

187
00:10:27,866 --> 00:10:30,287
This line absolutely breaks the game.

188
00:10:30,287 --> 00:10:32,307
It's not being translated properly, that kind of thing.

189
00:10:32,307 --> 00:10:33,488
Yes, we would do changes.

190
00:10:33,488 --> 00:10:37,069
But each time, we would have to bring, potentially, an actor back in

191
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:39,870
and pay their scale wage for one line.

192
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,311
That is expensive.

193
00:10:41,311 --> 00:10:43,151
It's something you want to avoid.

194
00:10:43,151 --> 00:10:45,192
So again, making the writers aware

195
00:10:45,192 --> 00:10:47,333
and being aware of the costs of that kind of thing

196
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:50,274
is a huge gain to the efficiency of your production.

197
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:55,237
The other big thing I think that affects schedules

198
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:56,177
is crumple plans.

199
00:10:56,177 --> 00:11:00,418
Crumple plans, to my mind, are the worst case scenario

200
00:11:00,418 --> 00:11:04,259
that you plan for so that you never, ever have to use them.

201
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:05,899
And I think, again, if we go back to the idea

202
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,320
that you want the team to trust you,

203
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,840
what you want to do is go and assume

204
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:12,741
that you will lose, say, one quarter of your production

205
00:11:12,741 --> 00:11:16,282
to some degree of rewrites, someone getting sick,

206
00:11:16,282 --> 00:11:19,903
staff loss, writer's block, or any number of other things,

207
00:11:19,903 --> 00:11:21,863
inexplicable horrors from beyond.

208
00:11:22,364 --> 00:11:25,105
depending on if you're working on some sort of Cthulhu thing,

209
00:11:25,105 --> 00:11:26,266
like Alexis Kennedy.

210
00:11:26,266 --> 00:11:28,848
If that's the case, then,

211
00:11:28,848 --> 00:11:31,190
you then want to go and crumple further, in my opinion.

212
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,111
And yes, this is profoundly pessimistic,

213
00:11:33,111 --> 00:11:35,192
but I've shipped a lot of friggin' video games,

214
00:11:35,192 --> 00:11:36,773
and after a while, it gets to you.

215
00:11:36,773 --> 00:11:39,675
The thing I think is that if you choose to build a game

216
00:11:39,675 --> 00:11:42,757
that is almost fundamentally built out of critical path,

217
00:11:42,757 --> 00:11:46,660
like core, everything is deeply, tightly enmeshed,

218
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,004
I would call this like a Naughty Dog game, a game where like every moment has absolute significance.

219
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:56,627
I think you should crumple even further and assume that another 25 percent, half of your production

220
00:11:56,627 --> 00:12:02,832
time, will be stuff that you're reworking and retooling. If that's the case, then you should

221
00:12:02,832 --> 00:12:08,416
scope according to, I have half the amount of time I think I have, because you will want to polish

222
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:11,218
and refine and make that absolutely precise.

223
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:14,332
That does not match what we do at BioWare though.

224
00:12:14,332 --> 00:12:16,255
At BioWare, we tend to do a mix.

225
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,478
And again, BioWare at its best.

226
00:12:18,478 --> 00:12:21,442
I was not always the most responsible,

227
00:12:21,442 --> 00:12:23,265
but the simple truth is that

228
00:12:23,265 --> 00:12:26,449
if you had 25% of your plan possible to be crumbled,

229
00:12:26,449 --> 00:12:27,170
and you had...

230
00:12:28,303 --> 00:12:30,745
Sorry, 25% of your play is impossible to be critical.

231
00:12:30,745 --> 00:12:34,629
That means it is absolutely important if you don't get these parts, you will not understand

232
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:35,750
exactly what's happening.

233
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:40,094
Then you should have the remaining, let's say 50% of the game, 25% is loss, 50% is crumble.

234
00:12:40,094 --> 00:12:42,397
That stuff should be important.

235
00:12:42,397 --> 00:12:44,999
It should be thematically appropriate.

236
00:12:44,999 --> 00:12:48,442
It should be things that lead into...

237
00:12:48,943 --> 00:12:51,964
your overall structure, but it could go.

238
00:12:51,964 --> 00:12:55,907
The best example I could think of, of a game that crumbled like this, would be Mass Effect 2.

239
00:12:55,907 --> 00:13:01,129
Mass Effect 2 had several beats that were necessary. You had to go to the abandoned Reaper,

240
00:13:01,129 --> 00:13:04,391
you had to see the Collectors attack people on Horizon,

241
00:13:04,391 --> 00:13:07,112
your ship had to be attacked and your crew had to be taken away.

242
00:13:07,112 --> 00:13:12,395
Those things had to happen for the Reaper, or sorry, the Collector, I guess, threat to escalate.

243
00:13:12,395 --> 00:13:13,776
They worked for the Reapers, so you know.

244
00:13:14,156 --> 00:13:20,639
transient property, but essentially, transitive? Anyway, so essentially those parts had to happen,

245
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:26,162
but the followers each had an acquisition plot and they had a loyalty plot, and any follower could

246
00:13:26,162 --> 00:13:31,445
have been removed from that game. You can't remove all the followers from the game because it's not

247
00:13:31,445 --> 00:13:37,708
a suicide mission with a squad that you've built up if you have no one, but you could move X number

248
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:39,649
of them and it would be successful.

249
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,179
That's crumple.

250
00:13:41,179 --> 00:13:45,442
That's where you have the opportunity to remove things and prioritize things and say the game

251
00:13:45,442 --> 00:13:48,023
could survive a collapse of scope.

252
00:13:48,023 --> 00:13:49,123
You don't want that to happen.

253
00:13:49,123 --> 00:13:55,927
But what I would argue is that by presenting a crumple plan and having one on hand is that

254
00:13:55,927 --> 00:13:57,787
it becomes less likely to happen.

255
00:13:57,787 --> 00:14:04,911
Because what you will find is that you have a team that registers that if I slip, if I

256
00:14:04,911 --> 00:14:08,773
spend three hours on Twitter, I'm at risk of cutting Morden.

257
00:14:10,231 --> 00:14:13,993
And I want to collect those motherfucking seashells.

258
00:14:13,993 --> 00:14:14,433
Mass Effect jokes.

259
00:14:14,433 --> 00:14:18,996
But that's the kind of thing you find.

260
00:14:18,996 --> 00:14:21,597
You will find that an awareness of what could go

261
00:14:21,597 --> 00:14:23,298
will actually catalyze a team and make

262
00:14:23,298 --> 00:14:24,879
them not want to lose it.

263
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:28,161
But still, as a writer, you've said, I'm not precious.

264
00:14:28,161 --> 00:14:32,283
I have built a thing that can survive an impact in the same

265
00:14:32,283 --> 00:14:34,524
way that cars have crumple zones that

266
00:14:34,524 --> 00:14:37,185
keep the passengers safe, even if they mess up the engine.

267
00:14:37,185 --> 00:14:39,247
Clear goals.

268
00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:43,933
These were absolutely critical and this is something that I had to learn over my years

269
00:14:43,933 --> 00:14:51,600
because I moved up through lead writer into creative director and what I quickly learned

270
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,905
is that I would spend hours building this delicious, detailed story summary of 60, 70

271
00:14:56,905 --> 00:15:02,210
pages and weirdly no one would read them.

272
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,892
And that will happen.

273
00:15:04,441 --> 00:15:09,886
That will happen. And the simple truth is because your entire team does not have the narrative priority that you do.

274
00:15:09,886 --> 00:15:16,952
And I'm again saying you insofar as I assume many of you are at least interested in narrative due to the summit you're attending.

275
00:15:16,952 --> 00:15:23,318
And that's okay. That's okay. I think that the simple truth is that your job to earn that trust and have the team go,

276
00:15:23,318 --> 00:15:26,280
Oh, I get it. I get it. I get it. Is to condense and present.

277
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:32,025
You need to be able to articulate what this game is about in less than 30 minutes.

278
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,492
And that's challenging.

279
00:15:33,492 --> 00:15:36,155
But I will tell you that every time I have tackled that challenge,

280
00:15:36,155 --> 00:15:37,717
I have felt better about the game.

281
00:15:37,717 --> 00:15:40,061
Because when I couldn't do it, I made changes.

282
00:15:40,061 --> 00:15:45,108
I absolutely shifted the tone of the game because it was too hard to understand.

283
00:15:46,391 --> 00:15:49,572
And that is a really, really powerful exercise for you to go through.

284
00:15:49,572 --> 00:15:54,133
You want, as well, to make a quick, high-level onboarding presentation.

285
00:15:54,133 --> 00:15:56,313
You want to be able to bring a new member into your team.

286
00:15:56,313 --> 00:16:00,814
And again, I'm speaking for the context of Dragon Age was 240 at the end of Inquisition.

287
00:16:00,814 --> 00:16:03,475
But you want someone new to come in and be able to go,

288
00:16:03,475 --> 00:16:06,016
okay, here's what we are about.

289
00:16:06,016 --> 00:16:07,696
Maybe you won't have a team of that size,

290
00:16:07,696 --> 00:16:11,477
but imagine bringing someone new in and being able to take a half an hour and have them go,

291
00:16:11,477 --> 00:16:12,517
cool, I get it. It's valuable.

292
00:16:13,595 --> 00:16:16,337
The things that you would want to put into that presentation

293
00:16:16,337 --> 00:16:18,319
are fundamentally the themes.

294
00:16:18,319 --> 00:16:21,161
You want to know what this game is about.

295
00:16:21,161 --> 00:16:23,303
You want to know what thread binds it together.

296
00:16:23,303 --> 00:16:29,148
Mass Effect 2 was about closure before everyone went to die.

297
00:16:29,148 --> 00:16:31,570
That whole game, even the marketing campaign,

298
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:33,171
was pitched as a suicide mission.

299
00:16:33,171 --> 00:16:36,755
Everybody wanted to go find their dad, mostly,

300
00:16:36,755 --> 00:16:39,137
or figure out other stuff that happened in their life.

301
00:16:39,137 --> 00:16:40,458
And they wanted to say goodbye.

302
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,020
They wanted closure.

303
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,661
Similarly, Dragon Age Origins was about sacrifice.

304
00:16:45,661 --> 00:16:51,203
It was about the nobility of putting the world ahead of yourself.

305
00:16:51,203 --> 00:16:53,523
Right? Dragon Age II was about rebellion.

306
00:16:53,523 --> 00:16:56,964
The status quo did not have to stand.

307
00:16:56,964 --> 00:16:58,925
You could fight back.

308
00:16:58,925 --> 00:17:02,206
In a lot of ways, the fact that your story was already being told by Varric

309
00:17:02,206 --> 00:17:05,367
meant that while things were proscripted,

310
00:17:05,367 --> 00:17:08,328
you still, as a player, had the opportunity to fight.

311
00:17:09,063 --> 00:17:10,404
That was a big part of it.

312
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:13,027
Dragon Age Inquisition, I don't even have listed on here

313
00:17:13,027 --> 00:17:14,128
because I'm scared to talk about it

314
00:17:14,128 --> 00:17:15,950
because people get angry at me, but let's be honest.

315
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:18,332
It was about faith and what happens

316
00:17:18,332 --> 00:17:20,714
when your faith is challenged.

317
00:17:20,714 --> 00:17:23,818
The Iron Bull believed in the Kuhn.

318
00:17:23,818 --> 00:17:27,982
What happens when that contradicts his friendships?

319
00:17:27,982 --> 00:17:30,004
Everybody in Dragon Age Inquisition

320
00:17:30,004 --> 00:17:31,325
was challenged in their faith.

321
00:17:31,325 --> 00:17:33,187
And that's what the game was about.

322
00:17:33,515 --> 00:17:35,877
It was a theme that ran through the whole damn thing.

323
00:17:35,877 --> 00:17:38,520
And you want to know what your tent poles are.

324
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,663
You want to understand what moments stand out.

325
00:17:40,663 --> 00:17:44,727
What moments could marketing, when they inevitably do,

326
00:17:44,727 --> 00:17:52,676
come to you and say, what are we going to show in the trailer?

327
00:17:52,676 --> 00:17:53,657
But you need an answer.

328
00:17:54,264 --> 00:17:57,769
You need to know. In fact, we got to the point where I would have the writing team

329
00:17:57,769 --> 00:18:02,436
find good quotes as they wrote them and throw them into a file because eventually

330
00:18:02,436 --> 00:18:04,559
marketing would come and look for moments.

331
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,822
And those quotes had to be thematically appropriate.

332
00:18:06,822 --> 00:18:09,727
If we could find them, we would have them, and our trailers were that much easier to build.

333
00:18:10,454 --> 00:18:13,835
And you want to make sure that your moments are a range of things.

334
00:18:13,835 --> 00:18:15,495
You sometimes need spectacle.

335
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:19,016
Hey, we exploded this castle that had another castle inside of it.

336
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:20,296
Wah.

337
00:18:20,296 --> 00:18:22,476
Sometimes you want them to be emblematic.

338
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,817
This is the moment when the Inquisition is first founded

339
00:18:24,817 --> 00:18:27,577
and they unfurl the banner while everyone looks really proud.

340
00:18:27,577 --> 00:18:29,338
Later, their home gets destroyed.

341
00:18:29,338 --> 00:18:30,138
Eh, Dragon Age.

342
00:18:30,138 --> 00:18:36,439
Or you want them to be evocative, such as the choral singing, right?

343
00:18:36,439 --> 00:18:36,999
As everybody...

344
00:18:38,047 --> 00:18:40,748
sings the dawn will come just before you find Skyhold.

345
00:18:40,748 --> 00:18:43,370
Those are moments. Those are moments that stand up.

346
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:47,492
They're moments that help cement the flow of the game that you are presenting.

347
00:18:47,492 --> 00:18:49,093
And you want those moments to be available,

348
00:18:49,093 --> 00:18:51,434
and you want to be able to articulate them clearly.

349
00:18:51,434 --> 00:18:54,416
Because when someone new is joining your team,

350
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:57,918
or a member of your team who isn't part of your narrative is listening,

351
00:18:57,918 --> 00:19:02,281
you want some things to stick, and high emotions stick.

352
00:19:04,278 --> 00:19:07,159
And then he says this, and then he says this, does not stick.

353
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:07,359
Ever.

354
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:07,460
Ever.

355
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:13,763
And finally, because there are so many people dependent on characters, and again, this may

356
00:19:13,763 --> 00:19:19,586
be a Bioware thing because characters were my jam, but the simple truth is that you want

357
00:19:19,586 --> 00:19:21,927
the motivations of the characters.

358
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:26,870
You know, who do they agree with, why do they care, and who do they fight with?

359
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:30,011
You want those to be easily, rapidly accessible.

360
00:19:30,724 --> 00:19:32,946
Right, Sarah, Dorian, and Iron Bull got along

361
00:19:32,946 --> 00:19:35,487
because they were basically team YOLO.

362
00:19:35,487 --> 00:19:38,229
Vivienne, Cassandra, and Blackwell got along

363
00:19:38,229 --> 00:19:39,951
because they were both, they were all uptight.

364
00:19:39,951 --> 00:19:41,972
Right, like you want to understand

365
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:44,554
where people overlap and where they differ.

366
00:19:44,554 --> 00:19:45,735
And that's the thing that again,

367
00:19:45,735 --> 00:19:48,056
helps the concept artists, helps the character art team,

368
00:19:48,056 --> 00:19:50,398
helps everybody to get a better sense of who's happening.

369
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:52,579
Because again, I fundamentally believe

370
00:19:52,579 --> 00:19:55,241
that the best stories are told through character.

371
00:19:55,241 --> 00:19:58,143
So, the other thing that I would recommend.

372
00:19:59,183 --> 00:20:01,084
is that as a communicator, and again, we're

373
00:20:01,084 --> 00:20:03,145
going back to the idea of how do I get the team to trust

374
00:20:03,145 --> 00:20:05,566
that I am going to rock this shit,

375
00:20:05,566 --> 00:20:08,747
is essentially that you should get comfortable with speaking

376
00:20:08,747 --> 00:20:10,168
in elevator pitches.

377
00:20:10,168 --> 00:20:12,088
Because not everybody around you is

378
00:20:12,088 --> 00:20:15,390
going to be willing to listen to 15 minute explanations

379
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:16,510
to why something's cool.

380
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:19,452
In our case, we would tend to find rapid ways

381
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:22,573
to convey the feel that we were going

382
00:20:22,573 --> 00:20:25,074
for for any individual piece of content.

383
00:20:25,074 --> 00:20:26,195
A vision touchstone.

384
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:29,953
is a really important thing to have because you want to know, wait a minute, wait a minute,

385
00:20:29,953 --> 00:20:35,055
are we delivering this thing that we set out to do? So as an example of that, in the Temple of

386
00:20:35,055 --> 00:20:40,978
Mythal, for anyone who's played Dragon Age Inquisition, it was basically our Indiana

387
00:20:40,978 --> 00:20:45,579
Jones in the last crusade moment. It was a moment in which you were finding a giant pool of water

388
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:50,581
as opposed to a cup, and it had an ancient guardian as opposed to a knight, and you had to go through

389
00:20:50,581 --> 00:20:51,261
a series of traps.

390
00:20:52,497 --> 00:20:54,078
That was exactly what we were going for.

391
00:20:54,078 --> 00:20:59,622
The feel like this was a place for you to respect or desecrate in the same way that

392
00:20:59,622 --> 00:21:02,624
the Germans desecrated and Indy respected and he succeeded.

393
00:21:02,624 --> 00:21:05,425
That was the note we were going for and the feel.

394
00:21:05,425 --> 00:21:11,649
And while, yes, that undersells exactly what's happening, it also...

395
00:21:13,088 --> 00:21:17,671
is an instantly graspable thing that you can evaluate the content you're building against.

396
00:21:17,671 --> 00:21:24,295
And when teams aren't 100% aligned on narrative, this is a shorthand that helps them get back

397
00:21:24,295 --> 00:21:24,656
on track.

398
00:21:24,656 --> 00:21:25,936
So consider it.

399
00:21:25,936 --> 00:21:27,157
And then let's talk about quality.

400
00:21:27,157 --> 00:21:36,664
This is a big deal, because the biggest thing that you will find and that I've found is

401
00:21:36,664 --> 00:21:38,245
that your team...

402
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:42,045
will sometimes worry about the writing quality.

403
00:21:42,045 --> 00:21:43,826
And this was a Bioware thing for sure,

404
00:21:43,826 --> 00:21:46,387
because a lot of people came to Bioware

405
00:21:46,387 --> 00:21:48,468
hoping that they would be involved in an epic story

406
00:21:48,468 --> 00:21:49,668
that would catch people's imaginations.

407
00:21:49,668 --> 00:21:52,169
We had a notorious technical art lead

408
00:21:52,169 --> 00:21:56,992
who'd be like, yeah, I'll just,

409
00:21:56,992 --> 00:21:58,892
I worry it's kind of shit.

410
00:21:58,892 --> 00:22:04,435
And I'd be like, Ben, it's cool.

411
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:09,889
let me tell you what's going on, Ben. It's cool. I don't know if

412
00:22:09,889 --> 00:22:12,590
you're still here, but Alistair, who is my former boss, is in the

413
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,971
audience and probably laughing his ass off right now. But the

414
00:22:14,971 --> 00:22:18,873
thing is, is that that's a fair complaint. Tell me it isn't

415
00:22:18,873 --> 00:22:21,914
shit. Tell me it's good. Tell me it's going to be a thing that I

416
00:22:21,914 --> 00:22:24,496
can get behind. And again, I'm going to take some givens here.

417
00:22:24,496 --> 00:22:29,258
You guys know how to document plots. You guys know how to talk

418
00:22:29,258 --> 00:22:32,619
to QA. You know how to make bugs happen, right? Cool. Well,

419
00:22:32,619 --> 00:22:34,380
those are the basics of quality.

420
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:40,569
But the thing that we did, and again, this is a thing that ties into a team,

421
00:22:40,569 --> 00:22:44,190
and I know not everybody has the reality that they get to work in a writing team,

422
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:48,272
but still, maybe there are people who have a narrative interest you can recruit to this,

423
00:22:48,272 --> 00:22:53,833
is that the BioWare process, at its best, involved peer review, extensive peer review.

424
00:22:53,833 --> 00:22:58,995
The flow, as it stood, was that everybody involved in the peer review,

425
00:22:58,995 --> 00:23:03,697
and the people that would be invited would be all of the writers,

426
00:23:03,697 --> 00:23:04,577
if you had more than one.

427
00:23:05,547 --> 00:23:09,229
the level designer, the cinematics person, QA,

428
00:23:09,229 --> 00:23:12,371
especially if they were narrative focused QA,

429
00:23:12,371 --> 00:23:15,632
and anyone else that was like of an ancillary department.

430
00:23:15,632 --> 00:23:17,974
Sometimes the voiceover director would be involved.

431
00:23:17,974 --> 00:23:20,255
Their job would be to play that content.

432
00:23:20,255 --> 00:23:22,236
We always tried to get it in engine if we could.

433
00:23:22,236 --> 00:23:25,878
If it was too early, fair enough, we'd do it by reading.

434
00:23:25,878 --> 00:23:26,958
But playing is always stronger.

435
00:23:28,649 --> 00:23:33,132
Everybody committed the time, we booked it in their calendars, we moved their scrum goals,

436
00:23:33,132 --> 00:23:37,596
we moved their kanbans, all that kind of stuff changed because we needed to make sure that

437
00:23:37,596 --> 00:23:41,119
this happened. And then we would bring them to a feedback session. And the writer who

438
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:45,762
had written said to Content, because we did try to give ownership over large scale plots,

439
00:23:45,762 --> 00:23:50,806
like I'm doing the Temple of Mythal, if that were mine, my job would be to come with a

440
00:23:50,806 --> 00:23:51,607
notebook and to not talk.

441
00:23:52,807 --> 00:23:57,755
And each person that had played that content would go through their notes.

442
00:23:57,755 --> 00:24:00,340
Some people had detailed, some people had less.

443
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,363
And they would go through and say, I felt this worked, I felt this didn't,

444
00:24:02,363 --> 00:24:05,849
I felt this clunked, this didn't match my vision for what I think we were doing.

445
00:24:07,086 --> 00:24:09,267
Those notes would be hard to hear.

446
00:24:09,267 --> 00:24:11,248
Feedback is always hard to hear when it's negative.

447
00:24:11,248 --> 00:24:12,469
Sometimes though, there would be like,

448
00:24:12,469 --> 00:24:14,510
this was hilarious, never lose this,

449
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:16,070
keep this, change that, et cetera.

450
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:18,712
Then we would go to the next person around the table

451
00:24:18,712 --> 00:24:20,833
and that person would say, ditto X, ditto Y,

452
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:23,054
ditto Z, or Z, I suppose.

453
00:24:23,054 --> 00:24:27,376
And we would go through and they would ditto

454
00:24:27,376 --> 00:24:29,477
anything that had already been repeated.

455
00:24:29,477 --> 00:24:31,178
So the key was to keep everyone engaged

456
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,859
because they could not repeat their notes.

457
00:24:33,331 --> 00:24:36,097
and they would give the feedback that was fresh.

458
00:24:36,097 --> 00:24:37,821
And the writer would write those down,

459
00:24:37,821 --> 00:24:39,565
but anything that was dittoed would get a tick.

460
00:24:40,732 --> 00:24:42,432
and the next person, and the next person,

461
00:24:42,432 --> 00:24:43,092
and the next person.

462
00:24:43,092 --> 00:24:45,853
And this resulted in what you found

463
00:24:45,853 --> 00:24:48,834
to be kind of a consensus level of feedback,

464
00:24:48,834 --> 00:24:50,595
where people were like, wow,

465
00:24:50,595 --> 00:24:52,736
seven people agreed that this scene clunked.

466
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:53,796
They didn't know what to do.

467
00:24:53,796 --> 00:24:55,377
They didn't understand the flow.

468
00:24:55,377 --> 00:24:57,277
This character seemed out of touch.

469
00:24:57,277 --> 00:24:59,718
However, all seven people also thought

470
00:24:59,718 --> 00:25:01,159
this bit was hilarious.

471
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:02,839
Okay, cool, we know what to keep.

472
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:03,519
We know what to change.

473
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:08,021
What was really intriguing about this, to my mind,

474
00:25:08,605 --> 00:25:12,129
is that it created a public commitment to feedback.

475
00:25:12,129 --> 00:25:15,433
It allowed the cinematics team or the level design team,

476
00:25:15,433 --> 00:25:17,295
other people from outside the writing team,

477
00:25:17,295 --> 00:25:19,557
to understand what was happening.

478
00:25:19,557 --> 00:25:19,998
Because.

479
00:25:20,647 --> 00:25:24,869
Not only would we write all those notes, we would then make up a plan and distribute it

480
00:25:24,869 --> 00:25:30,110
across the team to say this is what we're going to do to fix the concerns we identified.

481
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:34,012
So suddenly, everybody's going, wow, cool, look at the writers, they are awfully mature

482
00:25:34,012 --> 00:25:35,572
in the way that they handle feedback.

483
00:25:35,572 --> 00:25:39,913
They do not live in an ivory tower, they are not precious, they want to make a good game.

484
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:41,754
And that's how you build trust.

485
00:25:42,612 --> 00:25:44,334
There's a precise set of rules.

486
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:47,476
There's a decorum, and everyone follows this decorum,

487
00:25:47,476 --> 00:25:50,018
because if they don't, then you have the danger

488
00:25:50,018 --> 00:25:52,560
of someone becoming snarky, or kind of an asshat,

489
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,081
and going, yeah, well, who's stupid, when?

490
00:25:54,081 --> 00:25:55,402
And no one, no one wants that,

491
00:25:55,402 --> 00:25:57,844
because everybody's about to go through peer review.

492
00:25:57,844 --> 00:26:00,245
It was universally applied, even the leads.

493
00:26:00,245 --> 00:26:03,027
If I wrote something, I'd peer review it, right?

494
00:26:03,027 --> 00:26:05,149
And I was not immune to criticism, nor should I be.

495
00:26:06,125 --> 00:26:10,749
Other stakeholders being involved was a huge win because they would often suggest ways

496
00:26:10,749 --> 00:26:15,613
to achieve a goal that writing could only fix by adding more words.

497
00:26:15,613 --> 00:26:21,198
Hold on, I can make it clear that she is sad with tears and posture.

498
00:26:21,198 --> 00:26:23,460
Don't add more words to that, you can pull it out.

499
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:28,324
Multidiscipline fixes are always the best fixes because everybody plays to their strengths,

500
00:26:28,324 --> 00:26:31,126
which is why we actively invited other disciplines into the reviews.

501
00:26:33,524 --> 00:26:36,787
And, like I said, the ivory tower stigma is removed.

502
00:26:36,787 --> 00:26:39,529
It is the best possible thing you can do

503
00:26:39,529 --> 00:26:40,790
to make people trust you.

504
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:43,012
And we implemented this all the way back

505
00:26:43,012 --> 00:26:44,453
to Dragon Age Origins.

506
00:26:44,453 --> 00:26:47,035
We refined it through Mass Effect 1 and 2.

507
00:26:47,035 --> 00:26:48,876
We kept it up through Dragon Age 2 and Inquisition.

508
00:26:48,876 --> 00:26:50,738
It is widely used to this day.

509
00:26:50,738 --> 00:26:52,459
I highly, highly recommend it.

510
00:26:52,459 --> 00:26:54,261
Your first peer review will hurt.

511
00:26:54,261 --> 00:26:56,082
They always do,

512
00:26:56,082 --> 00:26:59,325
because nothing's ever perfect on first draft.

513
00:26:59,325 --> 00:27:00,866
But getting the feedback of your peers

514
00:27:00,866 --> 00:27:02,728
and knowing that later you will get them.

515
00:27:04,658 --> 00:27:09,560
is possibly the greatest feeling, because it means you're all committed to an amazing game,

516
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:16,202
right? And that is why we're here. So other teams led to multidiscipline solutions.

517
00:27:16,202 --> 00:27:21,164
Broadcasting the plan meant that people who weren't at the peer review still felt like a

518
00:27:21,164 --> 00:27:25,385
bunch of cool stuff happened. Holy cow, look at how good we're making this game. It's cool that

519
00:27:25,385 --> 00:27:29,987
the writers are doing that. And imagine, imagine, because I imagine some of you have run into those

520
00:27:29,987 --> 00:27:33,668
walls. Imagine the team saying, you're cool, right?

521
00:27:34,175 --> 00:27:41,020
Sounds pretty neat. But for me, the thing that I thought was super cool is that it meant if you had a junior member of the team,

522
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:45,604
they would hear the feedback of your Drew Karpissions or your David Gaters or Patrick Weeks.

523
00:27:45,604 --> 00:27:55,972
And they gave feedback. But someone new coming into the team would hear that and would be able to assimilate it and understand what was happening

524
00:27:55,972 --> 00:28:02,558
and understand why that feedback was being given, which meant that when they went to tackle their stuff, their stuff would be stronger.

525
00:28:03,239 --> 00:28:08,243
every single time. And the most important part to me is that the leads had to go through this as well.

526
00:28:08,243 --> 00:28:13,948
Patrick was usually the first one over the hill. He'd be like, I did some content everybody, tear

527
00:28:13,948 --> 00:28:18,772
it to pieces. But you know what? He wasn't precious about it. And his writing is amazing.

528
00:28:18,772 --> 00:28:27,419
He's probably blushing right now. So all of this, all of this is me saying that as writers.

529
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:33,642
You are magical, wondrous unicorns who can make people feel things that you want them to feel.

530
00:28:33,642 --> 00:28:36,423
That's a hell of a thing.

531
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:37,604
It's a bit of a superpower.

532
00:28:37,604 --> 00:28:42,166
And people don't necessarily understand just how rare that superpower is.

533
00:28:42,166 --> 00:28:44,808
To use simple words to make people cry.

534
00:28:44,808 --> 00:28:46,048
Or smile.

535
00:28:46,048 --> 00:28:49,910
Or feel like maybe it's going to be okay.

536
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:51,351
You know?

537
00:28:51,351 --> 00:28:57,314
And when I go to PAX's, and I go to other events, I love things like PAX because they're fan focused.

538
00:28:57,876 --> 00:29:02,379
And people come up and they tell me stories that make me fucking cry when I think about them.

539
00:29:02,379 --> 00:29:09,264
The thing that you can do is make their lives better.

540
00:29:09,264 --> 00:29:14,388
And I'm here to say that the best way to do that

541
00:29:14,388 --> 00:29:17,510
is not to just earn the trust of the team,

542
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:19,611
but to be transparent and open,

543
00:29:19,611 --> 00:29:23,274
and then be vulnerable.

544
00:29:23,274 --> 00:29:25,796
Put your cards on the table.

545
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:30,286
Tell them what you're trying to do.

546
00:29:30,286 --> 00:29:33,688
Even if there's a risk, they'll tell you you didn't do it.

547
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:37,291
Understand that the feedback you get from your team

548
00:29:37,291 --> 00:29:40,234
is feedback that you can use to change.

549
00:29:40,234 --> 00:29:42,616
Feedback you can use to improve.

550
00:29:42,616 --> 00:29:46,619
Feedback you can use to hone your blade

551
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:49,141
until you can drive it into the hearts of your players

552
00:29:49,141 --> 00:29:53,504
to the point where they are on Tumblr or Reddit

553
00:29:53,504 --> 00:29:55,106
and writing about how this.

554
00:29:56,854 --> 00:29:57,615
Fuck them up.

555
00:29:57,615 --> 00:30:02,657
Because that's your power.

556
00:30:02,657 --> 00:30:06,740
But that power gets better when you work as a team and when you look at those multidisciplinary

557
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,280
solutions.

558
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:12,583
And the thing I discovered, because this talk has talked about lessons learned over 14 years

559
00:30:12,583 --> 00:30:18,486
of BioWare, is that I came into and almost staggered into leadership.

560
00:30:19,842 --> 00:30:22,224
things were not great on Jade Empire and they said,

561
00:30:22,224 --> 00:30:23,765
do you want to be lead writer?

562
00:30:23,765 --> 00:30:25,426
Lead Empire, huh?

563
00:30:25,426 --> 00:30:27,748
And I remember my boss, Kevin Martins,

564
00:30:27,748 --> 00:30:30,990
lovely guy, lovely guy, asking me this at,

565
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:32,791
God, I think we were sitting on a beach

566
00:30:32,791 --> 00:30:34,412
where his kids were playing in the water.

567
00:30:34,412 --> 00:30:36,734
And I was like, um, I guess?

568
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:41,337
And I thought that I had to be all-knowing.

569
00:30:41,337 --> 00:30:46,020
I thought I had to be the guy who knew how this stuff worked

570
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,061
if I was going to be lead.

571
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:53,857
And over the years what I found is that admitting that I don't know how it all works, admitting

572
00:30:53,857 --> 00:30:58,621
that I need to learn and that the team can give me feedback, and admitting that I want

573
00:30:58,621 --> 00:31:06,568
to hear where it is broken by being vulnerable is the single best thing I've ever done for

574
00:31:06,568 --> 00:31:09,390
my career or for the games that have my name on them.

575
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:11,372
So what I would encourage you to do.

576
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:16,200
is make efforts to earn the trust of the team working around you.

577
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:21,081
Tell them that what you do is not just put words into sentences, but you write.

578
00:31:21,081 --> 00:31:25,982
And then be open and vulnerable to the feedback that they want to give you

579
00:31:25,982 --> 00:31:27,562
when they say it's not working.

580
00:31:27,562 --> 00:31:29,962
Because at the end of the day,

581
00:31:29,962 --> 00:31:34,083
you will have broken the conditioning of society that says

582
00:31:34,083 --> 00:31:41,245
leaders must be imperfect and never question all that toxic crap.

583
00:31:41,245 --> 00:31:41,425
No.

584
00:31:41,927 --> 00:31:45,249
get out there, tell people you want to know where you did right and where you did wrong,

585
00:31:45,249 --> 00:31:52,753
and you will find that your writing team and or your writing self will exceed, because those are

586
00:31:52,753 --> 00:31:57,695
the missteps you want to catch. And that is probably the lesson that I learned at Bioware.
