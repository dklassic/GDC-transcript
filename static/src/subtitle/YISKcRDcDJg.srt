1
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,461
I'm Zach Gage.

2
00:00:07,461 --> 00:00:11,143
This is building games that can be understood at a glance.

3
00:00:11,143 --> 00:00:12,543
If you're not familiar with my work,

4
00:00:12,543 --> 00:00:14,564
I've made a bunch of games that you may or may not

5
00:00:14,564 --> 00:00:18,106
have played, like Flip-Flop Solitaire, TypeShift,

6
00:00:18,106 --> 00:00:21,227
Really Bad Chess, Sage Solitaire, Tharsis,

7
00:00:21,227 --> 00:00:24,028
Ridiculous Fishing, Spell Tower, Lose-Lose,

8
00:00:24,028 --> 00:00:25,029
and a couple others.

9
00:00:25,029 --> 00:00:29,230
Anyway, I've been making games for quite a while on the phone,

10
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,792
almost since the beginning of the iPhone, actually.

11
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:34,732
And one thing that really struck me very early on

12
00:00:34,732 --> 00:00:37,293
was how different the experience of finding

13
00:00:37,293 --> 00:00:39,954
new games for the phone was versus other platforms.

14
00:00:39,954 --> 00:00:42,055
Mostly how I was finding new games

15
00:00:42,055 --> 00:00:43,916
was by looking over people's shoulders.

16
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:46,017
So over my friend's shoulder at a bar,

17
00:00:46,017 --> 00:00:48,358
over a stranger's shoulder on the subway,

18
00:00:48,358 --> 00:00:50,979
or at what the person next to me on an airplane was playing.

19
00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:54,641
Sometimes I get really into the game,

20
00:00:54,641 --> 00:00:56,062
and I start playing it in my head.

21
00:00:56,062 --> 00:00:59,544
And I would start critiquing the actions of the person

22
00:00:59,544 --> 00:01:00,364
quietly to myself.

23
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:05,968
And whenever I started doing this, one thing I noticed is I'd want to download the game myself.

24
00:01:05,968 --> 00:01:10,809
And sometimes the name of the game was on the screen, so I could just write it down.

25
00:01:10,809 --> 00:01:16,871
And other times I'd have to ask, and people were always really excited to tell me what the game was like and why they loved it.

26
00:01:16,871 --> 00:01:19,391
So I ended up asking a lot.

27
00:01:19,391 --> 00:01:22,112
And as I started making more and more mobile games,

28
00:01:22,112 --> 00:01:26,673
I really wanted to build games that could do this for other people,

29
00:01:26,673 --> 00:01:29,993
that could sell themselves to strangers who were looking over other people's shoulders.

30
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:34,020
That's kind of a mouthful as like a strategy,

31
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,683
so I'm just going to call it my friend Kevin proposed

32
00:01:37,683 --> 00:01:40,065
calling it Subway Legible Games,

33
00:01:40,065 --> 00:01:41,186
because we both live in New York,

34
00:01:41,186 --> 00:01:42,287
so that's what I'm going to call it.

35
00:01:42,287 --> 00:01:45,910
Okay, so obviously one caveat for this talk

36
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:48,052
is nothing that anyone tells you is going to be

37
00:01:48,052 --> 00:01:51,534
the one thing that makes you successful or not successful,

38
00:01:51,534 --> 00:01:54,357
but I do think that finding success with your games

39
00:01:54,357 --> 00:01:56,378
relies upon having a lot of little tricks

40
00:01:56,378 --> 00:01:59,801
that really fit your own practice and capabilities.

41
00:02:00,343 --> 00:02:03,045
and leveraging those tricks as best you can.

42
00:02:03,045 --> 00:02:05,566
And for me, designing for subway legibility

43
00:02:05,566 --> 00:02:07,447
has been a really powerful tool.

44
00:02:07,447 --> 00:02:10,089
And the reason why it's a powerful tool

45
00:02:10,089 --> 00:02:12,750
is that effectively it solves three problems for me

46
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,711
at the same time.

47
00:02:13,711 --> 00:02:17,373
And since I make most of my games totally by myself,

48
00:02:17,373 --> 00:02:20,655
any time I can solve three things with one solution,

49
00:02:20,655 --> 00:02:21,816
that's a really big win.

50
00:02:21,816 --> 00:02:27,019
So what are those three things?

51
00:02:27,019 --> 00:02:28,800
Well, designing for subway legibility

52
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,001
does three things for you.

53
00:02:30,502 --> 00:02:33,764
One, it makes implementing your tutorials a whole lot less work.

54
00:02:33,764 --> 00:02:36,645
Your game is easier to comprehend naturally

55
00:02:36,645 --> 00:02:40,208
because you're presenting information and game state

56
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:42,969
in a way that is designed to be naturally

57
00:02:42,969 --> 00:02:44,890
accessible to people who are playing the game.

58
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:48,212
This means when you sit down to make your tutorial, which

59
00:02:48,212 --> 00:02:50,174
probably, if you've done it, you would

60
00:02:50,174 --> 00:02:52,815
agree is the absolute worst part of making a video game,

61
00:02:52,815 --> 00:02:55,237
half the work is already done for you.

62
00:02:57,061 --> 00:03:00,043
Having a better tutorial means more people will enjoy your game

63
00:03:00,043 --> 00:03:02,564
across any kind of skill level, and so that's great.

64
00:03:02,564 --> 00:03:04,805
Two, it improves organic discovery.

65
00:03:04,805 --> 00:03:07,046
When your game is good at teaching other people to play,

66
00:03:07,046 --> 00:03:09,568
it'll draw in more viewers, and every player and every streamer

67
00:03:09,568 --> 00:03:12,249
of your game can focus on conveying how awesome your game is

68
00:03:12,249 --> 00:03:15,531
instead of explaining to everyone over and over again how the game works.

69
00:03:15,531 --> 00:03:17,532
Three, easier marketing.

70
00:03:17,532 --> 00:03:20,554
Your screenshots and your GIFs will need little to no context,

71
00:03:20,554 --> 00:03:23,775
and that makes pitching for coverage or going on viral on Twitter.

72
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:25,104
Way easier.

73
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:27,487
People say a picture is worth a thousand words,

74
00:03:27,487 --> 00:03:29,649
but that's only true if people can understand

75
00:03:29,649 --> 00:03:30,630
what your picture is about.

76
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:33,373
Okay, so you're probably thinking,

77
00:03:33,373 --> 00:03:36,456
all right, Zach, it's so easy to make indie games,

78
00:03:36,456 --> 00:03:38,799
or to make Subway legible games

79
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,962
when you make these tiny little mobile games.

80
00:03:41,962 --> 00:03:42,983
What about my big fancy PC game?

81
00:03:42,983 --> 00:03:43,884
Is that even possible?

82
00:03:43,884 --> 00:03:44,025
Yes.

83
00:03:44,025 --> 00:03:45,827
This is a screenshot of Into the Breach.

84
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:49,606
which mostly everybody regards as a brilliant tactical strategy game,

85
00:03:49,606 --> 00:03:54,490
and I regard as an incredible example of information organization and UI design.

86
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:57,673
This screenshot is one that went around Twitter before the game came out,

87
00:03:57,673 --> 00:04:01,135
and I think if we look at it, we can figure out why pretty easily.

88
00:04:01,135 --> 00:04:03,297
If anyone looking at this can immediately tell

89
00:04:03,297 --> 00:04:06,340
that it involves huge mechs and giant city-sized bugs,

90
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,482
the word mech is literally written on the screen.

91
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:11,864
It's turn-based, you have a bunch of units,

92
00:04:11,864 --> 00:04:13,566
these bugs are doing something bad.

93
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:17,188
Things are exciting and literally on fire.

94
00:04:17,188 --> 00:04:20,070
The kind of tile you're standing on has a tactical effect,

95
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,771
maybe like Advance Wars.

96
00:04:21,771 --> 00:04:24,693
And it's science fiction and it involves time pods,

97
00:04:24,693 --> 00:04:26,754
which is actually written on the screen also.

98
00:04:26,754 --> 00:04:29,396
These guys are geniuses.

99
00:04:29,396 --> 00:04:31,197
That sounds pretty exciting to me,

100
00:04:31,197 --> 00:04:33,659
and I can already imagine what the game is like.

101
00:04:33,659 --> 00:04:35,120
So how'd they make all that so clear?

102
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,382
So some of the things I cover in this talk

103
00:04:38,382 --> 00:04:41,044
might seem unbelievably obvious.

104
00:04:41,044 --> 00:04:43,786
But I find that the best design rules are always simple.

105
00:04:44,385 --> 00:04:44,945
and obvious.

106
00:04:44,945 --> 00:04:47,026
And that's because they need to be simple enough

107
00:04:47,026 --> 00:04:48,446
for you to break them sometimes,

108
00:04:48,446 --> 00:04:50,127
and they need to be obvious enough

109
00:04:50,127 --> 00:04:51,827
that you're gonna remember to actually do them.

110
00:04:51,827 --> 00:04:53,988
Back when I was in college studying design,

111
00:04:53,988 --> 00:04:56,629
I was introduced to the principle of the three reads.

112
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,630
At least that's what my design teacher called it,

113
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,830
so that's what I'm gonna call it

114
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:00,850
when I explain it to you now.

115
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,851
It's the key to all of this,

116
00:05:02,851 --> 00:05:04,552
and so if you come away from this talk

117
00:05:04,552 --> 00:05:07,133
and you only remember one thing that I explained,

118
00:05:07,133 --> 00:05:07,813
make it this thing.

119
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:11,050
The easiest way to understand the three reads

120
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,951
is by thinking about a concert poster.

121
00:05:12,951 --> 00:05:15,053
Imagine you're making a poster for some event

122
00:05:15,053 --> 00:05:15,874
that you're going to throw.

123
00:05:15,874 --> 00:05:18,797
Let's think about how posters are experienced.

124
00:05:18,797 --> 00:05:20,618
Generally, we see them on the street,

125
00:05:20,618 --> 00:05:24,122
and that means that the audience that a poster can greet

126
00:05:24,122 --> 00:05:26,724
is primarily limited by how far away you can actually

127
00:05:26,724 --> 00:05:27,425
read the poster.

128
00:05:27,425 --> 00:05:29,627
A poster that can only be read from 10 feet away

129
00:05:29,627 --> 00:05:31,589
is going to reach a lot less people than a poster that

130
00:05:31,589 --> 00:05:32,770
can be read by 30 feet away.

131
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:34,711
I promise I will get to how this affects games.

132
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:39,336
That means we want to have the text on our poster be big,

133
00:05:39,336 --> 00:05:41,217
but we don't want all of it to be big,

134
00:05:41,217 --> 00:05:43,297
because if it was all big, that'd be really confusing,

135
00:05:43,297 --> 00:05:45,798
and we'd barely be able to put anything on the poster.

136
00:05:45,798 --> 00:05:47,599
So what should be big?

137
00:05:47,599 --> 00:05:49,640
Probably the things that would convince people

138
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,420
to walk closer to the poster.

139
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,001
So essentially, we're trying to design a poster

140
00:05:53,001 --> 00:05:55,462
that's gonna pitch itself to people passing by.

141
00:05:55,462 --> 00:05:57,402
So first things first, who's performing?

142
00:05:57,402 --> 00:05:59,403
In our example, David Bowie, rest in peace.

143
00:05:59,403 --> 00:06:01,184
There's our target market.

144
00:06:01,184 --> 00:06:02,204
If you like David Bowie,

145
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,161
you're gonna walk closer to the poster.

146
00:06:05,161 --> 00:06:07,482
If you don't like David Bowie, I don't really care about you.

147
00:06:07,482 --> 00:06:11,605
So that's the first read, the first thing that people see

148
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:13,847
when they look at the poster, and it's meant to draw in

149
00:06:13,847 --> 00:06:15,067
the people that you wanna talk to.

150
00:06:15,067 --> 00:06:18,390
The second read is for people who have approached the poster

151
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,951
and are now looking for more information.

152
00:06:19,951 --> 00:06:21,712
We don't really have to worry so much now

153
00:06:21,712 --> 00:06:23,673
about the size of the text, we can make the text smaller

154
00:06:23,673 --> 00:06:25,194
because people are close to the poster.

155
00:06:25,194 --> 00:06:27,616
So this is what would be in the second read.

156
00:06:27,616 --> 00:06:29,097
When is this happening?

157
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,318
Where is this happening?

158
00:06:31,358 --> 00:06:33,880
what kind of show is he gonna be performing.

159
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,742
So hopefully now the viewer is interested,

160
00:06:35,742 --> 00:06:37,524
they like the venue, they're free on Tuesday,

161
00:06:37,524 --> 00:06:39,365
we can make it to the third read,

162
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:41,107
which is where we tell you how much it costs,

163
00:06:41,107 --> 00:06:42,989
remind you of the address, specify the time,

164
00:06:42,989 --> 00:06:46,392
and throw in all the little extra details

165
00:06:46,392 --> 00:06:48,614
that we need that nobody actually cares about,

166
00:06:48,614 --> 00:06:49,895
like who's presenting the show.

167
00:06:49,895 --> 00:06:51,416
No offense if you're a show presenter.

168
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:53,758
So there you go, that's the whole thing.

169
00:06:53,758 --> 00:06:55,480
That was pretty simple, right?

170
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:55,900
Talk over.

171
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:59,872
So this kind of design structure works not just for rock posters,

172
00:06:59,872 --> 00:07:01,413
but it also works for video games.

173
00:07:01,413 --> 00:07:02,733
Let's go back to that screenshot.

174
00:07:02,733 --> 00:07:06,235
What draws our eye first in this screenshot?

175
00:07:06,235 --> 00:07:07,256
The giant grid.

176
00:07:07,256 --> 00:07:09,857
It feels a little bit like Advance Wars.

177
00:07:09,857 --> 00:07:13,199
It has clearly what looks like a player-controlled unit.

178
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,400
Something's on fire. There's a bunch of bugs.

179
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,761
What do we see next?

180
00:07:16,761 --> 00:07:19,643
Whoa! Look at all these things to think about.

181
00:07:19,643 --> 00:07:21,944
It's turn-based. I have three people.

182
00:07:21,944 --> 00:07:23,665
My health seems to be the power grid.

183
00:07:24,424 --> 00:07:27,005
I guess I have to survive four turns, I have a mech,

184
00:07:27,005 --> 00:07:30,026
and it looks like depending on where I place my units,

185
00:07:30,026 --> 00:07:31,566
there are special tile effects.

186
00:07:31,566 --> 00:07:34,908
So, wow, it is gonna be like Advance Wars, maybe.

187
00:07:34,908 --> 00:07:36,388
And then on to the third read.

188
00:07:36,388 --> 00:07:37,989
Oh, my units have health, too,

189
00:07:37,989 --> 00:07:39,309
and there are bonus objectives,

190
00:07:39,309 --> 00:07:41,530
and look at all this crunchy tactical data,

191
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,170
and also time pods.

192
00:07:44,729 --> 00:07:48,311
The screenshot takes you from, hey, this is like Advance Wars,

193
00:07:48,311 --> 00:07:49,931
all the way through to, wow, this

194
00:07:49,931 --> 00:07:52,613
is so much more exciting than Advance Wars,

195
00:07:52,613 --> 00:07:54,433
just by how the information is laid out.

196
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:57,255
So obviously, this kind of clarity

197
00:07:57,255 --> 00:07:58,355
can help with your promotion.

198
00:07:58,355 --> 00:08:01,437
But how does it also help us make better tutorials

199
00:08:01,437 --> 00:08:02,477
and improve word of mouth?

200
00:08:02,477 --> 00:08:04,598
So something you might be familiar with

201
00:08:04,598 --> 00:08:06,399
from making tutorials is that generally when

202
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,079
you teach something new, you want

203
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:09,700
to introduce the rules in a specific order

204
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,941
so that players can build a mental model of how

205
00:08:11,941 --> 00:08:12,742
the game works.

206
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:15,462
starting from the broad strokes and then moving inwards

207
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:17,083
towards more specific rules.

208
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:17,144
Huh.

209
00:08:17,144 --> 00:08:20,227
Actually sounds a lot like how the three reads worked.

210
00:08:20,227 --> 00:08:25,413
The first read pulls you in, and that's the core of your game.

211
00:08:25,413 --> 00:08:27,275
The second read fills in key details

212
00:08:27,275 --> 00:08:29,657
or big, unintuitive rules.

213
00:08:29,657 --> 00:08:31,639
And the third read gives contextually important

214
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:33,341
information, like the time of the Bowie show

215
00:08:33,341 --> 00:08:35,243
only matters if I'm free on Tuesday.

216
00:08:35,856 --> 00:08:38,397
And that gives you contextually important rules,

217
00:08:38,397 --> 00:08:40,919
like what tile a giant bug is targeting

218
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:43,920
only matters if you're thinking about how to deal with that bug.

219
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,622
So a good tutorial teaches you things in the right order,

220
00:08:46,622 --> 00:08:49,223
and good design shows you things in the right order.

221
00:08:49,223 --> 00:08:52,024
Let's look at my game Spelltower as an example.

222
00:08:52,024 --> 00:08:55,626
So in Spelltower, you're trying to keep stacks of letters

223
00:08:55,626 --> 00:08:56,847
from reaching the top of the board,

224
00:08:56,847 --> 00:08:59,568
and you do this by spelling words that removes the blocks,

225
00:08:59,568 --> 00:09:01,329
and then more stuff gets added from the bottom.

226
00:09:01,329 --> 00:09:02,970
Let's look at the three reads here.

227
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:04,491
First thing.

228
00:09:05,171 --> 00:09:07,131
We want players to see just the letters.

229
00:09:07,131 --> 00:09:08,332
They need to look at the letters

230
00:09:08,332 --> 00:09:10,492
and think about what words they can spell.

231
00:09:10,492 --> 00:09:12,352
When you're comfortable finding letters,

232
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:13,793
you need to think about which columns

233
00:09:13,793 --> 00:09:15,273
are close to getting to the top

234
00:09:15,273 --> 00:09:17,233
and which letters are special and extra helpful

235
00:09:17,233 --> 00:09:18,713
for reducing the height of your stacks,

236
00:09:18,713 --> 00:09:20,434
like the blue letters will reduce a whole row.

237
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:23,794
And then finally, on the third read,

238
00:09:23,794 --> 00:09:26,155
is the information that only contextually matters.

239
00:09:26,155 --> 00:09:27,795
Things like what your high score is,

240
00:09:27,795 --> 00:09:29,275
which tiles can be used,

241
00:09:29,275 --> 00:09:32,396
and which ones need to be in at least four length words.

242
00:09:33,202 --> 00:09:35,843
The layout reinforces how to approach the game,

243
00:09:35,843 --> 00:09:39,926
both for the player, but it also reinforces it

244
00:09:39,926 --> 00:09:41,527
for every single person who ever looks

245
00:09:41,527 --> 00:09:42,608
at the game over their shoulder.

246
00:09:42,608 --> 00:09:42,668
OK.

247
00:09:42,668 --> 00:09:47,412
That's it for how to do the three reads properly.

248
00:09:47,412 --> 00:09:49,353
And before we move on to advanced concepts,

249
00:09:49,353 --> 00:09:51,414
I do want to take a quick look at what this can

250
00:09:51,414 --> 00:09:52,595
look like when it goes wrong.

251
00:09:52,595 --> 00:09:53,776
This is Slay the Spire.

252
00:09:53,776 --> 00:09:55,237
This is a game I enjoy quite a lot.

253
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,531
And in fact, it's a game that a lot of people enjoy,

254
00:09:57,531 --> 00:09:59,672
and it's done really well for itself.

255
00:09:59,672 --> 00:10:01,092
So I don't feel terrible subjecting it

256
00:10:01,092 --> 00:10:02,533
to a little bit of constructive criticism.

257
00:10:02,533 --> 00:10:04,954
If you made this game and you're in the audience,

258
00:10:04,954 --> 00:10:05,734
thank you for making this.

259
00:10:05,734 --> 00:10:08,075
I really like it.

260
00:10:08,075 --> 00:10:10,036
Slay the Spire actually does a really great job

261
00:10:10,036 --> 00:10:11,756
teaching the player how to play it.

262
00:10:11,756 --> 00:10:13,077
It's got one of the best tutorials

263
00:10:13,077 --> 00:10:14,437
I've seen in a really long time.

264
00:10:14,437 --> 00:10:16,098
Every single thing on the screen tells you

265
00:10:16,098 --> 00:10:17,998
what it does when you mouse over it.

266
00:10:18,408 --> 00:10:20,709
And the way that all these concepts are given to you

267
00:10:20,709 --> 00:10:22,829
is at this perfect leisurely pace

268
00:10:22,829 --> 00:10:25,070
so that when you arrive at a screen like this,

269
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:27,090
you understand every single thing that's going on.

270
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:29,831
The problem is when someone starts

271
00:10:29,831 --> 00:10:33,111
watching over your shoulder, or more often with a PC game

272
00:10:33,111 --> 00:10:34,972
like this, when they start watching on Twitch,

273
00:10:34,972 --> 00:10:36,612
they might not know what's going on.

274
00:10:36,612 --> 00:10:38,612
So if you've never played Slay the Spire,

275
00:10:38,612 --> 00:10:40,513
you probably wouldn't guess that the most

276
00:10:40,513 --> 00:10:42,093
important information on the screen

277
00:10:42,093 --> 00:10:45,274
is actually these little icons.

278
00:10:45,274 --> 00:10:46,534
These icons, more than the health,

279
00:10:46,941 --> 00:10:49,082
More than the armor, more than the cards in your hand,

280
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:51,283
explain the current state of a battle.

281
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:54,504
Not only are they tiny, but even if onlookers notice them,

282
00:10:54,504 --> 00:10:55,604
they have no idea what they mean.

283
00:10:55,604 --> 00:10:57,925
These should be in the second read,

284
00:10:57,925 --> 00:10:58,725
but they're in the third.

285
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:01,946
On top of that, the screen has a lot of empty space on it,

286
00:11:01,946 --> 00:11:03,747
but it still manages to look very busy.

287
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:06,068
Nearly everything on the screen is a tiny icon

288
00:11:06,068 --> 00:11:07,568
with a little number on it.

289
00:11:07,568 --> 00:11:09,669
What are these things?

290
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,830
And how can you have something but have zero of it?

291
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:15,011
And why is my health in two places

292
00:11:15,011 --> 00:11:16,052
and two different colors?

293
00:11:16,388 --> 00:11:18,230
And what are these decks, and do they really

294
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,411
need numbers on them?

295
00:11:19,411 --> 00:11:22,474
Couldn't the cards just be shown by the size of the deck?

296
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:24,135
And you might not know it from the presentation,

297
00:11:24,135 --> 00:11:26,598
but the one on the right is actually the discard pile.

298
00:11:26,598 --> 00:11:27,879
These aren't two separate decks.

299
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:29,401
They're all the pieces of one.

300
00:11:29,401 --> 00:11:33,064
The problem isn't that all of this information is displayed.

301
00:11:33,064 --> 00:11:35,306
It's that it's displayed at relatively the same scale,

302
00:11:35,306 --> 00:11:37,368
and that the stuff that you really, really need

303
00:11:37,368 --> 00:11:38,530
is actually the smallest.

304
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:41,232
Here's what the reeds of Slay the Spire look like.

305
00:11:41,943 --> 00:11:43,704
First read, two characters, a hand of cards,

306
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:45,064
an enter button, and the mana.

307
00:11:45,064 --> 00:11:46,685
This is looking pretty good so far.

308
00:11:46,685 --> 00:11:49,546
Second read is practically everything else.

309
00:11:49,546 --> 00:11:52,127
And third read is some small numbers

310
00:11:52,127 --> 00:11:54,749
and the all-important status icons under the health bars.

311
00:11:54,749 --> 00:11:57,990
So see how you can kind of barely

312
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:00,011
tell the difference between the second and the third reads

313
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:00,831
here?

314
00:12:00,831 --> 00:12:03,733
That's a pretty big sign that something is really overloaded.

315
00:12:03,733 --> 00:12:06,414
Do want to remind you, I love this game.

316
00:12:06,414 --> 00:12:08,395
This is just constructive criticism.

317
00:12:08,855 --> 00:12:14,479
And also, I want to remind you that this game does a great job mitigating a lot of this with really solid animations

318
00:12:14,479 --> 00:12:16,760
which is actually what I want to talk about next.

319
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:22,704
So hopefully by now you have a sense of what the first, second, and third read of something should look like.

320
00:12:22,704 --> 00:12:26,366
And now I want to cover a little bit of advanced stuff that you can't do with a poster.

321
00:12:26,366 --> 00:12:34,011
So unlike traditional print design, video games can move and they're interactive and that provides you with a couple additional options as a designer.

322
00:12:34,927 --> 00:12:37,428
One of these options is using movement and animation

323
00:12:37,428 --> 00:12:40,930
to temporarily raise or lower the read of a game component.

324
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:43,411
And Blizzard does this really well in their game Hearthstone.

325
00:12:43,411 --> 00:12:48,133
So pay attention when I run this video to the size changes

326
00:12:48,133 --> 00:12:49,833
and how your eye follows them.

327
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:07,177
Hearthstone is a constant wave of things

328
00:13:07,177 --> 00:13:09,078
being brought to your attention in the first read

329
00:13:09,078 --> 00:13:11,658
and then fading back into the second or third reads.

330
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:14,159
It's really masterful, but it's also a lot to consider

331
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:16,239
if I was going to break this down the way that I broke down

332
00:13:16,239 --> 00:13:17,520
into the Breach screenshot,

333
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,000
it would probably take this entire talk.

334
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,501
So instead, I want to look at a much smaller example,

335
00:13:24,501 --> 00:13:27,182
which is how I'm trying to solve a rules comprehension problem

336
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:28,162
in my game TypeShift.

337
00:13:28,162 --> 00:13:31,263
This is what a puzzle looks like in TypeShift.

338
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,363
Like in Spelltower, your first read is the letters.

339
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:35,832
Your second is the tiles and the background,

340
00:13:35,832 --> 00:13:39,555
and your third is the menus and the minor decorative elements.

341
00:13:39,555 --> 00:13:41,557
A longstanding issue I've had here

342
00:13:41,557 --> 00:13:43,559
is that some players jump to the conclusion

343
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:45,120
that your goal in a TypeShift puzzle

344
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,283
is to find every single word in the puzzle, which makes sense,

345
00:13:48,283 --> 00:13:51,906
because that's how most word-finding puzzles work.

346
00:13:51,906 --> 00:13:54,288
But actually, in TypeShift, your goal

347
00:13:54,288 --> 00:13:56,030
is to use every letter at least one time.

348
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:58,812
So I tried to make this clear in the tutorial

349
00:13:58,812 --> 00:14:00,073
by literally telling people.

350
00:14:00,517 --> 00:14:03,660
showing you that you're making a word turns your tiles

351
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:07,924
bluish green and that your goal is to turn them all green.

352
00:14:07,924 --> 00:14:10,926
But that wasn't good enough for many, many players.

353
00:14:10,926 --> 00:14:13,529
And the problem is that when the color tiles,

354
00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:16,291
that the color tiles in this game are on the second read

355
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:17,912
and when they change color,

356
00:14:17,912 --> 00:14:19,754
it's just as players are finding a word.

357
00:14:19,754 --> 00:14:22,216
So you're a little distracted and you don't notice.

358
00:14:22,216 --> 00:14:24,638
And so players interpret the color change

359
00:14:24,638 --> 00:14:25,679
as a decorative event.

360
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:28,522
So this is what it looks like when you find a word.

361
00:14:32,742 --> 00:14:35,664
I'm about to launch an attempted fix that uses animation

362
00:14:35,664 --> 00:14:38,846
to bring tile backdrops temporarily into the first read,

363
00:14:38,846 --> 00:14:41,427
and I'm doing that animation right after they find a word,

364
00:14:41,427 --> 00:14:43,909
so hopefully when they're not distracted by something else

365
00:14:43,909 --> 00:14:46,470
and focusing on something new.

366
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,571
So that looks like this.

367
00:14:47,571 --> 00:14:52,434
It's a very small adjustment,

368
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:54,735
animating the color change across the letters

369
00:14:54,735 --> 00:14:56,116
instead of having it pop in,

370
00:14:56,116 --> 00:14:58,477
but it reinforces the importance of the color

371
00:14:58,477 --> 00:14:59,838
as more than a decoration.

372
00:14:59,838 --> 00:15:01,819
It becomes an informational animation.

373
00:15:02,483 --> 00:15:05,226
and informational, that's not a real word.

374
00:15:05,226 --> 00:15:08,369
I never would have come to this change

375
00:15:08,369 --> 00:15:11,912
if I hadn't been considering the problem

376
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:13,073
within the context of the three reads,

377
00:15:13,073 --> 00:15:14,574
and so we'll see when I launch it how it works out.

378
00:15:14,574 --> 00:15:16,396
Another thing you can do in a game

379
00:15:16,396 --> 00:15:17,877
that you can't in a poster is provide

380
00:15:17,877 --> 00:15:21,761
hidden toggled information, which I call the fourth read.

381
00:15:21,761 --> 00:15:24,483
In Really Bad Chess, I needed to have a bunch of menus

382
00:15:24,483 --> 00:15:26,445
on the screen to allow you to use undo's,

383
00:15:26,445 --> 00:15:27,986
check scores, or quit the game,

384
00:15:27,986 --> 00:15:29,548
and those ended up looking like this.

385
00:15:30,442 --> 00:15:33,223
Unfortunately, those menus are horribly distracting.

386
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:36,485
The problem is that in chess, the pieces are really small

387
00:15:36,485 --> 00:15:37,765
and they're really detailed.

388
00:15:37,765 --> 00:15:40,287
And so when you have big graphical elements

389
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,108
on the screen, it's very easy for them

390
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:44,549
to overwhelm these tiny little pieces on the board.

391
00:15:44,549 --> 00:15:49,071
So to solve this, I made it so that whenever you tap away

392
00:15:49,071 --> 00:15:51,192
from the menus, whenever you're focusing on the game,

393
00:15:51,192 --> 00:15:53,954
all of those menus slide out of the first read

394
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:56,275
and into this sort of toggled fourth read.

395
00:15:56,685 --> 00:15:58,725
And now if you look at it, the board and the mode

396
00:15:58,725 --> 00:16:00,506
are squarely in the first read.

397
00:16:00,506 --> 00:16:02,666
They're the things that your eye goes right to.

398
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:04,567
And everything else looks pretty balanced.

399
00:16:04,567 --> 00:16:08,168
And if you tap up on the menu area, the menus come in.

400
00:16:08,168 --> 00:16:09,548
And now they're in the first read.

401
00:16:09,548 --> 00:16:11,769
But that's totally fine, because they're

402
00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:13,549
what you're looking at and what you're looking for.

403
00:16:13,549 --> 00:16:16,490
And it's always all right to have that in the first read.

404
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:18,630
And everything feels very natural.

405
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:21,531
OK, the last thing that I want to look at,

406
00:16:21,531 --> 00:16:23,312
well, I got through this pretty quick.

407
00:16:23,908 --> 00:16:25,729
is my game Sage Solitaire,

408
00:16:25,729 --> 00:16:27,729
which is probably the most complicated layout

409
00:16:27,729 --> 00:16:29,630
I've done in a mobile game.

410
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,651
When I was designing Sage, I had to include

411
00:16:31,651 --> 00:16:34,052
a lot of specific extra information on the screen

412
00:16:34,052 --> 00:16:36,172
that could be a little distracting,

413
00:16:36,172 --> 00:16:39,113
because there are a lot of specific rules in Sage.

414
00:16:39,113 --> 00:16:41,194
My initial layout for it looked like this,

415
00:16:41,194 --> 00:16:43,735
which is, I think, a total mess.

416
00:16:43,735 --> 00:16:46,556
The first read is the cards, and that's great,

417
00:16:46,556 --> 00:16:50,017
but read two is basically everything up top,

418
00:16:50,017 --> 00:16:51,258
the name of the hand.

419
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,441
the decorative stack of cards, the bonus suit, the trashes,

420
00:16:54,441 --> 00:16:55,682
everything blends together.

421
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:59,603
The problem is that most of these things

422
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:01,564
shouldn't even be in the second read.

423
00:17:01,564 --> 00:17:05,726
The stack of cards is just a decoration element, basically.

424
00:17:05,726 --> 00:17:09,247
The bonus suit is important, but you only need it sometimes.

425
00:17:09,247 --> 00:17:13,028
And the trashes are also important, but also not

426
00:17:13,028 --> 00:17:14,949
important all the time.

427
00:17:15,465 --> 00:17:16,685
There's actually something up there

428
00:17:16,685 --> 00:17:18,546
that you do need to know constantly,

429
00:17:18,546 --> 00:17:20,946
and that is the name of the hand that you're trying to score

430
00:17:20,946 --> 00:17:22,467
and how much it's worth.

431
00:17:22,467 --> 00:17:23,927
If you didn't know how to play this game,

432
00:17:23,927 --> 00:17:26,308
looking at the screenshot would not teach you how to do it.

433
00:17:26,308 --> 00:17:28,408
It wouldn't tell you what was important.

434
00:17:28,408 --> 00:17:30,129
It wouldn't really tell you anything.

435
00:17:30,129 --> 00:17:33,069
So my solution was to break the screen down

436
00:17:33,069 --> 00:17:36,370
into a big play area that has the first and second reads in it,

437
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:39,131
and then a small side area that has all the third read

438
00:17:39,131 --> 00:17:39,891
information.

439
00:17:39,891 --> 00:17:41,072
So let's break it down.

440
00:17:41,072 --> 00:17:43,092
First thing you see is the cards.

441
00:17:44,382 --> 00:17:48,385
The second is the name of the hand and the cash-in button.

442
00:17:48,385 --> 00:17:52,528
And then last, you see the trashes, the suit, the score,

443
00:17:52,528 --> 00:17:55,510
a hint button, and your used card pile,

444
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,830
nicely out of the way.

445
00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:00,833
There's also a little bit of a kind of trick in this layout,

446
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:04,115
and that is normally it would be sort of an issue

447
00:18:04,115 --> 00:18:05,596
if the things that were taking up

448
00:18:05,596 --> 00:18:09,098
the entirety of your second read were contextually visible.

449
00:18:09,098 --> 00:18:12,901
So right now, the cash-in button and the name of the hand

450
00:18:13,448 --> 00:18:16,950
Where do those go when you don't have a hand selected?

451
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,451
Does that ruin the layout?

452
00:18:18,451 --> 00:18:21,133
Does it make it confusing that there would be no second read?

453
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:23,614
Well, so actually, I don't get rid of both of them.

454
00:18:23,614 --> 00:18:26,316
And I use one very deliberately as the only thing

455
00:18:26,316 --> 00:18:27,517
in the second read.

456
00:18:27,517 --> 00:18:29,798
And that is I leave the hand button,

457
00:18:29,798 --> 00:18:32,320
and I just change the text to tap for hand list.

458
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,421
That's the only thing in the second read

459
00:18:34,421 --> 00:18:35,622
in this entire screen.

460
00:18:35,622 --> 00:18:38,504
And the reason I did that was very intentional.

461
00:18:38,504 --> 00:18:41,826
And it was that even though Sage Solitaire is a solitaire game,

462
00:18:42,617 --> 00:18:44,698
It's very different than a solitaire game.

463
00:18:44,698 --> 00:18:46,559
Usually in solitaire, you're trying to make piles

464
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,239
and move cards around in piles,

465
00:18:48,239 --> 00:18:50,701
but this is all about making poker hands.

466
00:18:50,701 --> 00:18:53,682
And that's very irregular for a poker game,

467
00:18:53,682 --> 00:18:56,223
or for a solitaire game, and it does a couple things.

468
00:18:56,223 --> 00:18:57,184
One, you'd never expect it

469
00:18:57,184 --> 00:18:58,744
if you were looking over someone's shoulder,

470
00:18:58,744 --> 00:19:00,605
and two, if you are a solitaire person,

471
00:19:00,605 --> 00:19:01,906
you might not even know the poker hands.

472
00:19:01,906 --> 00:19:05,047
And so leaving this big piece of information

473
00:19:05,047 --> 00:19:06,228
as the only thing in the second read

474
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,349
guides everybody who's looking at it.

475
00:19:08,736 --> 00:19:10,356
So eye to that piece of information,

476
00:19:10,356 --> 00:19:13,077
and it tells them, A, this is a game about making hands,

477
00:19:13,077 --> 00:19:15,137
and B, if you are literally playing it

478
00:19:15,137 --> 00:19:16,297
and you don't know the hands,

479
00:19:16,297 --> 00:19:17,918
here's a giant button that you can press

480
00:19:17,918 --> 00:19:18,698
that's gonna help you.

481
00:19:18,698 --> 00:19:21,118
I think it's very easy to look at this layout

482
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:23,539
and be tempted to make the hand list a small button

483
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:25,419
that sits off to the side,

484
00:19:25,419 --> 00:19:26,159
but if I'd done that,

485
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:28,240
it wouldn't have helped people looking over his shoulder,

486
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,920
and it wouldn't have helped normal solitaire players

487
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,101
feel more confident and able to play this game.

488
00:19:33,101 --> 00:19:34,721
So there you go.

489
00:19:34,721 --> 00:19:35,461
That wasn't so bad.

490
00:19:35,461 --> 00:19:36,141
Let's recap.

491
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:37,962
You have three standard reads.

492
00:19:38,727 --> 00:19:41,769
The first one pulls you in and explains the core of your game.

493
00:19:41,769 --> 00:19:45,490
The second one fills in key details or big, unintuitive rules.

494
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:47,691
And the third gives you contextually important information

495
00:19:47,691 --> 00:19:51,113
or contextually important rules.

496
00:19:51,113 --> 00:19:54,394
You also have a fourth read that comes from toggled information

497
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:58,016
and the ability to move things up and down in the read structure

498
00:19:58,016 --> 00:19:59,856
through movement and animation.

499
00:19:59,856 --> 00:20:01,577
And if you do all that stuff correctly,

500
00:20:01,577 --> 00:20:04,639
you get subway legibility.

501
00:20:04,639 --> 00:20:07,240
It becomes much less work to make a great tutorial.

502
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,991
People see your game out in the world or on Twitch

503
00:20:09,991 --> 00:20:12,694
and they get it and they want to get it.

504
00:20:12,694 --> 00:20:15,356
And explaining what your game is with a screenshot

505
00:20:15,356 --> 00:20:18,459
or an animated GIF becomes extremely simple.

506
00:20:18,459 --> 00:20:19,740
So I hope that was helpful.

507
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,281
Thanks.

508
00:20:20,281 --> 00:20:30,370
We have time for questions.

509
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:32,432
If you'd like to ask Zach a question,

510
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:34,293
please come to one of the mics in the aisles.

511
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:37,306
And while we're waiting for folks to come up,

512
00:20:37,306 --> 00:20:38,286
I have a question for you.

513
00:20:38,286 --> 00:20:38,546
Yeah.

514
00:20:38,546 --> 00:20:42,249
So what do you think the concept of the three reads

515
00:20:42,249 --> 00:20:43,850
means for designing trailers?

516
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:44,350
Oh, boy.

517
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:48,973
I definitely think, in general, you

518
00:20:48,973 --> 00:20:51,255
want to approach a trailer fairly similarly.

519
00:20:51,255 --> 00:20:53,836
You want to have the thing right at the start that's

520
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:54,877
going to draw people in.

521
00:20:54,877 --> 00:20:56,298
And as your trailer progresses, you

522
00:20:56,298 --> 00:21:00,120
can get more and more detailed about what's going on.

523
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:00,761
I actually think.

524
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:04,439
Maybe almost more important than that is just keep your trailer short.

525
00:21:04,439 --> 00:21:06,921
Your trailer shouldn't be more than a minute.

526
00:21:06,921 --> 00:21:11,144
And most people will turn off a trailer after like 10 seconds.

527
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:15,186
So if you don't hit them right in the face with something that's really compelling,

528
00:21:15,186 --> 00:21:16,647
that's probably not good for you.

529
00:21:16,647 --> 00:21:20,129
But one thing that is nice about doing a trailer,

530
00:21:20,129 --> 00:21:23,532
even though it's incredibly annoying unless you love making trailers.

531
00:21:24,077 --> 00:21:27,078
is that it really helps you refine what your pitch is going to be,

532
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:29,979
because your pitch to most press and most of Twitter

533
00:21:29,979 --> 00:21:33,061
is actually the same as the beginning of a trailer.

534
00:21:33,061 --> 00:21:36,703
Your first 30 seconds of a trailer should show what your game's about,

535
00:21:36,703 --> 00:21:38,663
why it's special, and how it works.

536
00:21:38,663 --> 00:21:41,865
You think that's why in Hollywood trailers these days

537
00:21:41,865 --> 00:21:44,106
they do that mini-trailer thing at the start,

538
00:21:44,106 --> 00:21:45,767
where there's like a whole bunch of action?

539
00:21:45,767 --> 00:21:46,447
Have you seen that?

540
00:21:46,447 --> 00:21:49,108
Where they have really quick snippets of what's going to be

541
00:21:49,108 --> 00:21:49,849
in the rest of the trailer?

542
00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:51,950
Because that's like showing you up front some of the meat.

543
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,110
Yeah, that makes sense.

544
00:21:53,328 --> 00:21:56,191
Though also in Hollywood trailers, they have a voiceover,

545
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:58,193
so they get to tell you exactly why you care.

546
00:21:58,193 --> 00:21:58,494
That's true.

547
00:21:58,494 --> 00:22:03,258
Anyone have any questions?

548
00:22:03,258 --> 00:22:04,479
Speechless.

549
00:22:04,479 --> 00:22:12,868
So my question is about, let's say,

550
00:22:14,479 --> 00:22:17,461
In, specifically I work in arcade games mostly,

551
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,083
but this is probably true in the App Store too,

552
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:21,785
where everyone's trying to get your attention,

553
00:22:21,785 --> 00:22:24,627
everything's trying to be as loud as possible

554
00:22:24,627 --> 00:22:26,929
to be grabbing the player's attention.

555
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:31,993
And do you have any tricks for being subway legible

556
00:22:31,993 --> 00:22:36,096
in the context of also competing with the flashbang

557
00:22:36,096 --> 00:22:38,958
of all the other games in the market that are around?

558
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:41,120
Is there anything that you've found kind of...

559
00:22:42,073 --> 00:22:44,754
grabs attention without being overwhelming?

560
00:22:44,754 --> 00:22:45,295
Sure.

561
00:22:45,295 --> 00:22:49,237
I think the first thing that you need to think about,

562
00:22:49,237 --> 00:22:50,998
at least I can speak to the context of the App Store,

563
00:22:50,998 --> 00:22:53,999
is that most people actually don't understand

564
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:54,960
how the App Store works.

565
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,562
And they don't approach the marketing in the App Store

566
00:22:58,562 --> 00:23:01,643
in the way that is going to make the most of it for them.

567
00:23:01,643 --> 00:23:04,625
And if you do that, that kind of puts you

568
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:06,286
on another level already.

569
00:23:06,286 --> 00:23:07,166
That is very helpful.

570
00:23:07,649 --> 00:23:08,910
The thing that you need to understand, at least,

571
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:11,111
about the App Store is you need to sit down and look at,

572
00:23:11,111 --> 00:23:12,652
like, what are the pieces of information

573
00:23:12,652 --> 00:23:14,433
that people are going to get right away?

574
00:23:14,433 --> 00:23:17,235
And how do I use that information just good enough

575
00:23:17,235 --> 00:23:19,257
to be able to get them to the next piece of information?

576
00:23:19,257 --> 00:23:21,158
So in the App Store, you get.

577
00:23:21,595 --> 00:23:23,477
an icon, you get the name of your game,

578
00:23:23,477 --> 00:23:24,998
and you get a small subtitle.

579
00:23:24,998 --> 00:23:27,220
And you need to make the entire case for someone

580
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,102
to click your game based on those things.

581
00:23:29,102 --> 00:23:31,444
But more importantly, you don't have to make anything else.

582
00:23:31,444 --> 00:23:33,706
You're not trying to sell your whole game on that.

583
00:23:33,706 --> 00:23:36,388
You're just trying to sell them to tap on the icon.

584
00:23:36,388 --> 00:23:39,231
And so when you're designing an icon,

585
00:23:39,231 --> 00:23:41,113
you can think about what do I need

586
00:23:41,113 --> 00:23:43,034
and what do I not need in this.

587
00:23:44,015 --> 00:23:46,636
Told by the icon that can't be told by the name.

588
00:23:46,636 --> 00:23:48,177
What do I not need to include?

589
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:51,899
So for example, a lot of times when you're making a word game,

590
00:23:51,899 --> 00:23:53,740
you have to convey that it's a word game.

591
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,701
And so how do you do that?

592
00:23:54,701 --> 00:23:57,002
Do you put a lot of text in the icon?

593
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:59,284
You can do that if the name of your game

594
00:23:59,284 --> 00:24:01,305
doesn't necessarily clearly show.

595
00:24:01,305 --> 00:24:02,786
So TypeShift, you wouldn't necessarily

596
00:24:02,786 --> 00:24:03,826
know that that's a word game.

597
00:24:03,826 --> 00:24:04,427
It could be an app.

598
00:24:04,427 --> 00:24:06,028
So the icon better show something

599
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:07,789
that looks like a word game.

600
00:24:07,789 --> 00:24:09,370
But if your game is called.

601
00:24:09,789 --> 00:24:13,252
crosswords five, then you can put a happy smiling face

602
00:24:13,252 --> 00:24:14,793
on your icon and everybody's already gonna know

603
00:24:14,793 --> 00:24:15,333
it's a word game.

604
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:16,635
So that's the first step.

605
00:24:16,635 --> 00:24:18,116
And then when people tap on it,

606
00:24:18,116 --> 00:24:19,817
then what's the next thing that people are gonna see?

607
00:24:19,817 --> 00:24:24,120
Well, here, you're effectively at your second read.

608
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,102
You have someone as like a captive audience,

609
00:24:26,102 --> 00:24:27,783
and now you just have to sell them on your game.

610
00:24:27,783 --> 00:24:30,345
And what you generally have is a...

611
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:34,671
a short video snippet that better be really exciting right away

612
00:24:34,671 --> 00:24:37,332
because people are on their phones and it'll go away.

613
00:24:37,332 --> 00:24:41,193
And then you have a series of images that people can slide through

614
00:24:41,193 --> 00:24:45,915
that I typically use to explain why the game works and what's special about it.

615
00:24:45,915 --> 00:24:47,576
And then that's really it.

616
00:24:47,576 --> 00:24:49,237
Nobody ever actually reads the text.

617
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:51,258
If people read the text, they're already sold on your game,

618
00:24:51,258 --> 00:24:53,339
so you just have to not screw it up at that point.

619
00:24:53,339 --> 00:24:55,039
You don't really have to keep selling.

620
00:24:56,955 --> 00:24:59,476
Yeah, I also want to say just as a total side note,

621
00:24:59,476 --> 00:25:01,097
I really never thought I would be up here

622
00:25:01,097 --> 00:25:02,498
giving a talk about promotion.

623
00:25:02,498 --> 00:25:04,920
This is so fucking weird for me.

624
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:10,023
I like want to make fun, weird art games that people like,

625
00:25:10,023 --> 00:25:11,964
but I guess you got to learn how to do this stuff

626
00:25:11,964 --> 00:25:12,725
to make that work.

627
00:25:12,725 --> 00:25:15,666
All right, thanks, Zach.

628
00:25:15,666 --> 00:25:18,448
Everybody, please make sure you fill out your surveys

629
00:25:18,448 --> 00:25:20,049
to give Zach feedback on his talk.

630
00:25:20,049 --> 00:25:21,310
But before you go,

631
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:23,491
please give him one final round of applause.

632
00:25:27,535 --> 00:25:27,642
you
