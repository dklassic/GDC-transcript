1
00:00:04,125 --> 00:00:06,267
Okay, looks like we're ready to get started.

2
00:00:06,847 --> 00:00:09,509
Just a quick message from all the guys in the red shirts,

3
00:00:09,549 --> 00:00:12,071
make sure you turn off your noisemakers,

4
00:00:12,111 --> 00:00:13,372
your phones, and everything else.

5
00:00:14,113 --> 00:00:15,434
And yeah, we'll get stuck into it.

6
00:00:17,335 --> 00:00:18,496
So my name's Luke Muscat,

7
00:00:18,637 --> 00:00:20,878
I'm the Chief Creative Officer at Halfbrick Studios.

8
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,259
I've made these games.

9
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,621
People will probably know me best

10
00:00:24,681 --> 00:00:26,503
from Fruit Ninja and Jetpack Joyride.

11
00:00:27,493 --> 00:00:30,656
But today, I'm going to be talking about something else completely different.

12
00:00:30,756 --> 00:00:32,817
A game that no one here has played at all.

13
00:00:32,957 --> 00:00:35,499
It's only been played by 17 guys at Halfbrick.

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,861
And this talk is really a story.

15
00:00:38,381 --> 00:00:42,324
It's not going to be one of those talks that's full of lots of scientific facts

16
00:00:42,384 --> 00:00:44,285
and lots of, you know, really accurate graphs

17
00:00:44,486 --> 00:00:46,847
and do these things to make your game better.

18
00:00:46,947 --> 00:00:49,709
It's really, you know, a story about something that happened at work.

19
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:50,450
And...

20
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:54,813
I learned a lot from this thing happening to me,

21
00:00:54,893 --> 00:00:57,495
so I really hope that everyone else will get something else out of it too.

22
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:01,137
So, just a quick disclaimer as I start.

23
00:01:01,317 --> 00:01:04,960
These are the guys from Halfbrick, and they are really, really great guys.

24
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,802
Like, they are really the nicest bunch of people you'll ever meet.

25
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:11,264
They're definitely not monsters,

26
00:01:11,564 --> 00:01:14,646
despite what I may or may not say in all of this presentation.

27
00:01:15,287 --> 00:01:16,247
Except for maybe Chevy.

28
00:01:18,289 --> 00:01:19,830
He's looking pretty monstrous right there.

29
00:01:21,963 --> 00:01:23,843
So a little bit of back story before I begin.

30
00:01:24,643 --> 00:01:27,764
So myself and one programmer and one artist

31
00:01:27,824 --> 00:01:28,864
worked on Fruit Ninja.

32
00:01:28,904 --> 00:01:31,304
And then we spent a long time updating that game.

33
00:01:31,344 --> 00:01:34,145
We were on it for almost two years just shipping updates.

34
00:01:34,725 --> 00:01:38,306
And finally, we managed to ship that off onto another team

35
00:01:38,346 --> 00:01:39,686
to work on all of the updates.

36
00:01:39,846 --> 00:01:42,166
And we were finally ready to do something new.

37
00:01:42,526 --> 00:01:44,767
We'd been so burnt out from working on the one thing

38
00:01:44,807 --> 00:01:45,387
for so long.

39
00:01:46,367 --> 00:01:47,887
So we started doing some prototyping.

40
00:01:47,987 --> 00:01:51,368
Here are a bunch of abandoned prototypes that we worked on.

41
00:01:51,835 --> 00:01:53,677
And you know, they were looking pretty good,

42
00:01:53,718 --> 00:01:54,899
and they were feeling pretty good,

43
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:59,406
but we just weren't quite sure about what we were doing

44
00:01:59,526 --> 00:02:01,990
and whether we were on the right track.

45
00:02:02,611 --> 00:02:04,694
We really didn't have any goals or objectives

46
00:02:04,734 --> 00:02:06,436
to define our success.

47
00:02:07,748 --> 00:02:11,111
So we said, let's set some tougher goals. Let's come up with some tricky stuff.

48
00:02:11,532 --> 00:02:14,054
So the goal one was to make it massively multiplayer.

49
00:02:14,294 --> 00:02:19,380
By massively multiplayer, I don't mean, you know, a thousand-person server or anything like that.

50
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,963
But something that the whole company could play at once was the idea.

51
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:26,893
The second one was to keep it really super simple to play.

52
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:31,277
As you might expect from someone who's made a game about slicing fruit and

53
00:02:31,338 --> 00:02:35,642
spent ten months working on a one-button game, I really like simple stuff and

54
00:02:35,682 --> 00:02:37,484
really simple ideas and mechanics.

55
00:02:38,445 --> 00:02:42,088
This picture in the background is a flow chart from Warhammer 40,000 and I

56
00:02:42,168 --> 00:02:44,811
see that and my head just explodes.

57
00:02:46,712 --> 00:02:49,656
And the final goal, and the most important one for me,

58
00:02:49,696 --> 00:02:52,900
was to really get people in the office talking and engaged.

59
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:56,906
And I really just wanted people to be super into this game

60
00:02:56,986 --> 00:02:58,688
and talking about it all of the time.

61
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:00,631
And this was my, at any cost,

62
00:03:00,711 --> 00:03:03,134
I really wanna make sure people get engaged in the game.

63
00:03:04,954 --> 00:03:08,616
So for all of these really exciting goals and objectives,

64
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:10,917
spent a bit of time, I worked with another designer

65
00:03:11,017 --> 00:03:12,818
called Joe Gatling for a while,

66
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:14,900
and we came up with this amazing idea

67
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,620
that was gonna hit all of those goals,

68
00:03:17,141 --> 00:03:18,702
and it looked like this.

69
00:03:20,202 --> 00:03:23,824
It's made out of paper, sticky tape down onto a table.

70
00:03:23,965 --> 00:03:26,126
We wanted to do a massively multiplayer game,

71
00:03:26,146 --> 00:03:27,887
but it didn't really seem feasible for us

72
00:03:27,927 --> 00:03:30,508
to make a whole heap of backend infrastructure,

73
00:03:30,548 --> 00:03:33,230
so we did it all the old school way, pen and paper.

74
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:38,222
So it was a 17 player, and it wasn't 17 player deliberately,

75
00:03:38,242 --> 00:03:41,324
I just simply asked who in the office wants to play this game,

76
00:03:41,344 --> 00:03:43,366
and we had exactly 17 people sign up.

77
00:03:44,027 --> 00:03:47,449
Real time strategy game with a really strong focus

78
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,231
on diplomacy and cooperation.

79
00:03:51,353 --> 00:03:52,794
So let me explain to you how it worked.

80
00:03:54,122 --> 00:03:56,502
This is a nice big close-up of what it looked like.

81
00:03:56,822 --> 00:03:57,862
These were your tanks.

82
00:03:58,143 --> 00:04:00,263
These were actually little pieces of

83
00:04:01,423 --> 00:04:03,544
magnetic whiteboard strips with marker on it.

84
00:04:04,264 --> 00:04:06,865
All the pages were just glued together onto the table,

85
00:04:07,025 --> 00:04:08,565
and that was how it was constructed.

86
00:04:08,765 --> 00:04:11,626
Very, you know, not fancy, not like Jason's

87
00:04:12,146 --> 00:04:15,327
titanium board game yesterday, that's for sure.

88
00:04:16,807 --> 00:04:17,707
And here are the rules.

89
00:04:18,107 --> 00:04:19,688
You have three hearts.

90
00:04:21,191 --> 00:04:24,172
And you are able to do basically two things by and large.

91
00:04:24,212 --> 00:04:25,932
You can either move or you can shoot.

92
00:04:26,612 --> 00:04:28,253
Both of these cost action points.

93
00:04:28,353 --> 00:04:30,893
So if you move one space, that costs one action point.

94
00:04:31,093 --> 00:04:33,454
And if you shoot, that costs one action point

95
00:04:33,554 --> 00:04:35,674
and will deduct one heart every time

96
00:04:35,754 --> 00:04:36,895
from whoever you shoot at.

97
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:38,255
You have a range.

98
00:04:38,615 --> 00:04:41,996
The range is by default two, so quite close.

99
00:04:42,036 --> 00:04:43,776
It certainly wasn't a very wide range.

100
00:04:44,356 --> 00:04:47,677
You could also invest action points in upgrading your range.

101
00:04:48,941 --> 00:04:52,202
And the basic rule is, last player standing wins. Pretty simple.

102
00:04:53,302 --> 00:04:56,343
So the way action points work was, you know, we weren't going to be able to do this

103
00:04:56,443 --> 00:04:59,964
turn-by-turn with seventeen players, and to keep our objective of

104
00:05:00,084 --> 00:05:03,625
making it massively multiplayer, if we scaled it up to fifty people, that's just not

105
00:05:03,665 --> 00:05:04,225
going to work.

106
00:05:04,786 --> 00:05:08,107
So at the beginning of every single day, everyone gets an action point,

107
00:05:08,247 --> 00:05:11,248
and then you can spend those action points whenever you want. That's kind of

108
00:05:11,268 --> 00:05:13,688
how we resolved that many players issue.

109
00:05:14,368 --> 00:05:17,970
The action points are literally leftover badges we had from PAX.

110
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:21,192
And you dropped them into a box with a hole cut in the top.

111
00:05:21,272 --> 00:05:22,792
And there was a little logbook next to it.

112
00:05:23,253 --> 00:05:25,174
And that was, you know, that was just...

113
00:05:25,454 --> 00:05:28,235
people would log what they were doing, and that way we knew no one was cheating.

114
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:31,297
Very simple, very low-tech.

115
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,543
And then the last rule was about trading. So you could send your action points to

116
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:41,304
someone else. And this is what was really interesting to me about the game.

117
00:05:41,645 --> 00:05:45,046
The way we visualized it was you couldn't just trade points with anyone

118
00:05:45,106 --> 00:05:48,388
on the board. You had to actually shoot that action point to them.

119
00:05:48,968 --> 00:05:51,669
So you had the same range as you did for attacking.

120
00:05:52,049 --> 00:05:55,090
So that way, anyone within your range is both friend and foe

121
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:55,970
at the same time.

122
00:05:56,511 --> 00:05:59,191
You could potentially shoot that person, or you could help

123
00:05:59,231 --> 00:06:00,712
them out by giving them action points.

124
00:06:00,772 --> 00:06:03,092
And that was really the crux of what I thought would make

125
00:06:03,132 --> 00:06:04,373
this game very interesting.

126
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:08,574
So just a really quick demonstration, just to clarify

127
00:06:08,614 --> 00:06:09,214
these rules.

128
00:06:09,274 --> 00:06:12,515
This is the grid, the yellow squares are the players.

129
00:06:12,815 --> 00:06:14,736
Every day, everyone gets an action point.

130
00:06:15,136 --> 00:06:16,736
In this case, one of the guys moves.

131
00:06:17,256 --> 00:06:18,357
That costs us an action point.

132
00:06:20,137 --> 00:06:23,221
One player trades over an action point, so now this player has two,

133
00:06:24,062 --> 00:06:25,785
and they shoot twice,

134
00:06:26,746 --> 00:06:28,629
which takes off those hearts.

135
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:31,213
Next day, there's more action points.

136
00:06:31,253 --> 00:06:34,457
The player down the bottom, who has done nothing, has now collected two action points.

137
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,059
You're not obligated to have to use them.

138
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:42,774
And then the final thing about the game was there was a jury, and this was basically lifted

139
00:06:42,854 --> 00:06:43,895
straight from Survivor.

140
00:06:44,276 --> 00:06:48,601
It's a very similar idea. Dead players form a jury. I really wanted a way that

141
00:06:48,901 --> 00:06:51,484
dead players would still be involved and active in the game.

142
00:06:52,084 --> 00:06:55,728
And so the way this worked was every day the jury would vote for a player they

143
00:06:55,768 --> 00:06:56,449
wanted to help.

144
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:00,291
And any player that got at least three votes from the jury

145
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:03,072
would get an additional action point that day.

146
00:07:03,432 --> 00:07:05,432
So what this would do is, as the game kind of...

147
00:07:05,613 --> 00:07:07,753
more and more people died and the player base shrunk,

148
00:07:07,793 --> 00:07:09,854
it would accelerate the game towards a conclusion.

149
00:07:10,034 --> 00:07:10,714
That was the idea.

150
00:07:11,454 --> 00:07:16,616
And it also meant you couldn't just be a complete backstabbing bastard, right?

151
00:07:16,656 --> 00:07:18,437
Because you really need friends on the jury

152
00:07:18,497 --> 00:07:20,357
if you're going to win right, right at the end.

153
00:07:20,457 --> 00:07:21,578
Very similar to Survivor.

154
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:26,925
So I kicked off the game. This is what it looked like. It was set up in a room,

155
00:07:26,945 --> 00:07:29,968
in a meeting room that happened to have glass walls,

156
00:07:30,729 --> 00:07:32,911
and I just sticky taped the rules up on the ball,

157
00:07:34,292 --> 00:07:37,115
told everyone how it worked, and I left and went to my desk.

158
00:07:37,295 --> 00:07:39,658
Gave everyone their first action point, and then I was done.

159
00:07:40,573 --> 00:07:43,815
And I was really thinking, you know, I wonder how long it's going to take someone

160
00:07:44,335 --> 00:07:49,378
to actually make a move in this game. I'm really expecting everyone to start hoarding their action points and

161
00:07:49,778 --> 00:07:54,580
you know, saving it up for right at the end and then it just being this crazy all-out thing that happens all at once.

162
00:07:55,967 --> 00:08:03,137
So, three hours later I'm sitting at my desk, and there's all this kind of commotion that I can hear from the other side of the room.

163
00:08:03,157 --> 00:08:04,960
And I'm like, what the hell is going on?

164
00:08:05,681 --> 00:08:10,989
And so I walk in to where the board is set up to check out what's going on, and it is a fucking graveyard in there.

165
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:17,775
And not a graveyard in the sense that it's very quiet, a graveyard in the sense that a lot of players are dead.

166
00:08:18,696 --> 00:08:24,720
And immediately I'm like, what the hell is going on? I don't even understand how that could possibly happen so quickly.

167
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,722
You guys all only have one action point. How did this happen?

168
00:08:29,043 --> 00:08:31,344
It turns out that there's definitely no one cheating.

169
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:37,849
And the reason I was surprised was because the way I had designed the trading rules did not work the way I thought they would.

170
00:08:38,907 --> 00:08:42,830
This is what I had expected to happen on a bit of a bigger Zoom this time.

171
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,671
I thought that what the trading rules would do

172
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:47,473
would be localize them into little factions.

173
00:08:47,513 --> 00:08:50,775
You'd get little groups of 2, 3, 4, 5 people working together

174
00:08:51,296 --> 00:08:52,877
trying to get an advantage that way.

175
00:08:52,917 --> 00:08:55,699
Because, you know, alliances in this kind of game are really going to help.

176
00:08:56,719 --> 00:08:59,421
It turns out this is definitely not what happened at all.

177
00:09:00,578 --> 00:09:04,761
So this slide, just for reference, is all animated in PowerPoint,

178
00:09:04,861 --> 00:09:07,643
and it took me like two and a half hours to make this thing happen.

179
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:11,727
So I'm really hoping it illustrates the point.

180
00:09:12,587 --> 00:09:14,189
So this is basically what happened.

181
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:18,232
One player trades over his action point. This is what I expected.

182
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:21,114
What I didn't expect is the chain that happened next.

183
00:09:21,555 --> 00:09:25,898
The second player passes both of those action points to the next player.

184
00:09:27,319 --> 00:09:28,080
And what happens?

185
00:09:29,295 --> 00:09:35,324
is through some incredibly advanced, incredibly complicated alliance-making.

186
00:09:42,259 --> 00:09:46,821
We managed to get this situation. This we immediately coined as daisy-chaining.

187
00:09:47,081 --> 00:09:51,543
That player now has nine action points. They could kill three players right now with that.

188
00:09:52,403 --> 00:09:55,965
And this is crazy. I mean, I can see how...

189
00:09:56,745 --> 00:10:00,227
Obviously the rules afford this happening, but there was no way I predicted it.

190
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:04,528
I really thought what the trading rules were going to do would localize these little factions.

191
00:10:06,002 --> 00:10:11,125
So, I mean, everyone is running around pissed off and angry and confused,

192
00:10:11,245 --> 00:10:15,126
and some people are really excited because they managed to pull off this move.

193
00:10:15,226 --> 00:10:16,947
And I'm like, well, I guess that's a success.

194
00:10:17,027 --> 00:10:19,168
People are talking about the game. They're engaged.

195
00:10:19,769 --> 00:10:22,250
So, that part, yeah, all good.

196
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,251
So a little bit further on now.

197
00:10:25,831 --> 00:10:29,013
This is day three. You'll see there are a lot of people in this room.

198
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:34,966
The way that this was being designed, again, with the whole, you know, you can make your move at any time,

199
00:10:35,006 --> 00:10:38,752
was I was hoping it wouldn't interfere with work. You'd receive your action point.

200
00:10:39,132 --> 00:10:42,598
And then you could make your move any time during the day, whenever you have a spare moment.

201
00:10:43,704 --> 00:10:50,627
And now we're even at day three. We're at a point where there are so many people in this room, it's a good thing the walls are made of glass, because not everyone can fit in there.

202
00:10:51,927 --> 00:11:01,271
There's a really interesting thing. This photo doesn't demonstrate it quite as well, but just an interesting subtle thing that I only noticed when I was rehearsing this this morning,

203
00:11:01,731 --> 00:11:08,193
was that all the people in this image basically have their arms crossed, which is some interesting body language.

204
00:11:10,209 --> 00:11:13,354
So day five, things are getting crazier still.

205
00:11:13,595 --> 00:11:15,418
It's a little bit difficult to see in this photo,

206
00:11:15,478 --> 00:11:18,083
but you'll notice now I've added an extra page

207
00:11:18,283 --> 00:11:21,208
below the rules and it says cease fire, 9 a.m. till 10 a.m.

208
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:28,143
The reason is, is people were so into this game that everyone was missing their morning scrums.

209
00:11:28,663 --> 00:11:30,044
Because they were down in the room.

210
00:11:30,645 --> 00:11:38,891
So I literally had to say, right, nothing, no actions allowed, 9am till 10am, get to scrum and do your work.

211
00:11:38,971 --> 00:11:42,854
You'll also notice the guy in the grey shirt in the middle is actually on crutches.

212
00:11:43,334 --> 00:11:44,495
He worked upstairs.

213
00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:53,055
He was hauling his ass down the stairs, up and down all the time on crutches to check

214
00:11:53,095 --> 00:11:54,500
out what's going on on the game board.

215
00:11:56,088 --> 00:12:00,692
And then things get even crazier. This is day seven. This is an SMS I got in the morning.

216
00:12:01,092 --> 00:12:03,113
This is our CFO, Renal.

217
00:12:03,594 --> 00:12:07,997
He was calling in sick that day, and he was so worried about the outcome of the game

218
00:12:08,037 --> 00:12:12,440
that he's asking me to veto his powers to another player called Biebs.

219
00:12:13,781 --> 00:12:17,123
He's going to love this. His name's Justin, so his nickname went from Bieber to Biebs.

220
00:12:17,784 --> 00:12:19,805
Because he was allowed to veto Bieber.

221
00:12:21,727 --> 00:12:25,608
And he's even got an image there attached of the game board from the previous days

222
00:12:25,668 --> 00:12:29,450
that he would be able to give very detailed instructions to that player

223
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:32,371
to make sure that his move that day wouldn't be wasted.

224
00:12:33,132 --> 00:12:34,873
I mean, this is just getting crazy.

225
00:12:35,093 --> 00:12:38,914
And then, you know, I said, yeah, sure, okay, someone can play on your behalf.

226
00:12:38,994 --> 00:12:42,336
And it caused this massive uproar and it's... dramas.

227
00:12:43,783 --> 00:12:48,365
At this point I decided to do an anonymous survey. I wanted to find out a bit about what people were thinking.

228
00:12:48,465 --> 00:12:51,186
And no one would tell me anything. I would go up and ask people

229
00:12:51,686 --> 00:12:54,767
and they knew that I was trying to find out what was going on between players

230
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:57,587
and everyone thought I was going to rat them out to the enemy.

231
00:12:57,607 --> 00:13:01,589
Because I was the only person across all the players.

232
00:13:01,649 --> 00:13:05,570
So the only way I could get any information out of them was through an anonymous survey.

233
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:09,591
So I wanted to find out about two things. There was a lot of questions, but these were the interesting things.

234
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:17,515
Diplomacy and interacting with other players is, and as you can see, extremely important to me, is way, way up there.

235
00:13:17,535 --> 00:13:21,738
So, great! I mean, you know, we wanted to make a game about cooperation, that seems to be working out just fine.

236
00:13:21,758 --> 00:13:26,262
The next one was engagement. I discussed the game with other players.

237
00:13:27,443 --> 00:13:29,344
Eleven plus times a day!

238
00:13:29,364 --> 00:13:35,309
This is just crazy. So again, I'm like, I'm feeling pretty good. This is a success, right?

239
00:13:35,329 --> 00:13:39,613
Like, I'm hitting all of the things that I wanted to hit with this prototype. Feeling great.

240
00:13:41,479 --> 00:13:46,462
So obviously with all of this going on, productivity in the workplace is going through the roof, right?

241
00:13:47,222 --> 00:13:49,924
Oh wait, no, the other thing. It's going way, way down.

242
00:13:50,344 --> 00:13:51,685
It's just disastrous.

243
00:13:52,025 --> 00:13:57,068
And other players are coming—sorry, not other players, other employees, not involved in the game,

244
00:13:57,168 --> 00:14:00,670
are telling me that this game is just tearing their teams apart.

245
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,131
Like, it's just massively disruptive.

246
00:14:03,491 --> 00:14:06,993
You know, they'll be looking for someone for a code fix, and the person can't be found.

247
00:14:07,334 --> 00:14:09,295
Probably should check where they're playing the game.

248
00:14:12,462 --> 00:14:15,024
So by day nine, things start to get pretty tense.

249
00:14:17,066 --> 00:14:19,267
And it's not even one particular thing.

250
00:14:19,408 --> 00:14:23,071
It's just this general feeling and vibe in the office.

251
00:14:23,211 --> 00:14:27,434
You really start to feel that there's some animosity between people from playing this game.

252
00:14:27,454 --> 00:14:30,217
There's people who would normally be very friendly,

253
00:14:30,457 --> 00:14:32,999
and they're looking over their shoulders, and they're paranoid,

254
00:14:33,419 --> 00:14:34,781
and it is just crazy.

255
00:14:35,982 --> 00:14:38,950
And you know, at this point, I'm still like kicking back and laughing.

256
00:14:38,991 --> 00:14:41,457
I'm like, oh my God, this is the best thing I've ever made.

257
00:14:41,477 --> 00:14:43,683
This is, this is so great.

258
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:49,804
So then at some point, shit gets a little too real.

259
00:14:49,864 --> 00:14:52,586
And I didn't put a stupid Google image on this slide

260
00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:56,608
because I really don't want to downplay how serious this was.

261
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:58,889
A player came to me and they were upset.

262
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:00,870
Really, really upset.

263
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:03,372
And they were like, this game, I feel at this point,

264
00:15:03,572 --> 00:15:07,434
is damaging the relationships I have at work,

265
00:15:07,554 --> 00:15:09,736
personal friendships I have with other people here,

266
00:15:09,836 --> 00:15:12,337
and generally making me not want to come to work

267
00:15:12,457 --> 00:15:13,418
and be involved in this.

268
00:15:14,963 --> 00:15:20,128
This is alarm bells, right? Like, this is not good. This was not the intention of the game at all.

269
00:15:20,989 --> 00:15:25,213
And this is pretty serious business, and we're hearing it from a couple of people, not just one person.

270
00:15:25,353 --> 00:15:30,037
One person in particular, but, you know, a lot of other people are starting to resonate with this as well.

271
00:15:31,339 --> 00:15:32,960
So at this point we shut down the game.

272
00:15:33,861 --> 00:15:37,644
Because, honestly, productivity in the whole office had come to a halt.

273
00:15:37,704 --> 00:15:41,228
People are getting upset. That's not what we want to happen at the office at all.

274
00:15:44,504 --> 00:15:48,208
So after that, I'm trying to figure out what made this happen.

275
00:15:48,328 --> 00:15:53,133
What turned a bunch of really nice people who normally play together really well...

276
00:15:54,488 --> 00:15:58,270
to do these kinds of things and to get so upset and worked up about the game.

277
00:15:58,331 --> 00:16:00,632
I just couldn't really understand.

278
00:16:01,012 --> 00:16:03,834
And I was trying to figure out—at first my response was, you know,

279
00:16:03,994 --> 00:16:06,636
ah, these guys, they're just taking it way too seriously.

280
00:16:06,676 --> 00:16:07,897
It's really all their own fault.

281
00:16:08,478 --> 00:16:11,159
But I really wanted to understand the mechanics of why this happened.

282
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,221
And I'm in two minds, right? Like, on the one mind, I'm—

283
00:16:15,499 --> 00:16:18,501
Wow, I've made something amazing and powerful and incredible,

284
00:16:18,581 --> 00:16:22,423
and you know, it's a great story, and it's just this crazy cool thing.

285
00:16:22,784 --> 00:16:24,945
And the other mind, I'm really upset,

286
00:16:25,045 --> 00:16:27,987
because I've done something that's literally damaged the office.

287
00:16:28,007 --> 00:16:31,109
The office that I love and, you know, the people that I'm very close with,

288
00:16:31,929 --> 00:16:34,151
it's causing problems for them. So I feel terrible.

289
00:16:35,351 --> 00:16:38,313
And in a third mind, I'm like, maybe this will make a good GDC talk one day.

290
00:16:40,034 --> 00:16:43,837
So I do another survey to figure out what turned these guys into such monsters.

291
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:48,226
And the first question asked is, you know, the game was exciting and compelling.

292
00:16:48,286 --> 00:16:52,367
And yeah, like, look at that. Overwhelmingly yes, the game was exciting and compelling.

293
00:16:52,467 --> 00:16:53,888
Great. That's fantastic.

294
00:16:56,289 --> 00:16:57,789
But this one's a bit more interesting.

295
00:16:57,989 --> 00:16:59,730
Start to ask a little bit tougher questions.

296
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:01,330
The game made me feel paranoid.

297
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:04,631
Almost 75% of people agree or strongly agree.

298
00:17:05,392 --> 00:17:09,133
And, I mean, I don't know about you guys, but paranoia I don't think is a positive feeling.

299
00:17:10,557 --> 00:17:14,820
And so then I asked a final question that was really a tough question, which was

300
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,982
the game made me feel upset at times.

301
00:17:18,743 --> 00:17:20,043
And that was the response I got.

302
00:17:21,244 --> 00:17:25,167
Which to me was pretty incredible. Like more than half the players at some point

303
00:17:25,267 --> 00:17:26,668
felt upset in the game.

304
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:30,550
And again, you know, I'm really not trying to make a game to upset people.

305
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:33,832
I want them to be excited and I want them to be embracing the positives of the game

306
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,254
and not really responding to the negatives.

307
00:17:38,218 --> 00:17:45,581
So I'm in two minds, you know, the game is a success in that I did manage to make something so compelling and so engaging.

308
00:17:45,741 --> 00:17:47,421
But on the other hand, it's a failure.

309
00:17:48,102 --> 00:17:53,323
Because I've done something that's hurt people and damaged people and been a detriment to the office.

310
00:17:53,883 --> 00:17:59,805
And again, at this point I'm still kind of like, ah, maybe it's those guys, they're just taking it too seriously and all of that.

311
00:18:01,182 --> 00:18:06,545
So I decided to launch an investigation to get a bit of better understanding why all this happened,

312
00:18:06,705 --> 00:18:08,166
more than just beyond a survey.

313
00:18:09,306 --> 00:18:14,389
I start going and talking to various people and really drilling down into

314
00:18:15,049 --> 00:18:19,751
what they were doing and what was happening behind the scenes that I couldn't see as an observer.

315
00:18:20,231 --> 00:18:24,834
And it turns out there was a lot happening behind the scenes that was completely invisible to me.

316
00:18:25,792 --> 00:18:29,657
And some of it is just way escalated beyond what I thought it would be.

317
00:18:30,437 --> 00:18:32,480
So this is one of the very first things I uncovered.

318
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,707
Secret plans.

319
00:18:35,727 --> 00:18:39,990
So this is a secret plan put together by the artist of Fruit Ninja, Shaaf.

320
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:43,272
And you can see this is a pretty complicated plan.

321
00:18:43,552 --> 00:18:48,656
This is involving a large amount of action points, moving through a very large amount of people.

322
00:18:49,016 --> 00:18:55,741
And then you can see the green numbers is displaying how many action points are in the pool at that particular time.

323
00:18:56,082 --> 00:19:02,626
And it's timed all the way down to killing Shaz, which is our boss, Shaneel Dio, with the very last action point.

324
00:19:04,025 --> 00:19:10,747
To think about how long it would have taken to coerce with so many players to make this plan happen is incredible.

325
00:19:11,248 --> 00:19:15,309
Like, that's a massive amount of organization and a massive amount of time effort.

326
00:19:15,349 --> 00:19:16,410
So this blew me away.

327
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:21,772
But not as much as when I found this, which is the actual secret plan.

328
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:29,955
So, the first secret plan was just to throw everyone else off the scent.

329
00:19:31,163 --> 00:19:35,466
This is the actual plan to take all of those action points from those players.

330
00:19:35,806 --> 00:19:38,568
They think they're about to take out all the guys on the left side

331
00:19:38,828 --> 00:19:41,790
and then turn around and backstab all the guys on the other side.

332
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:47,313
So before I'd been thinking, wow, this is a lot of forethought, a lot of really, you know,

333
00:19:48,013 --> 00:19:52,496
really deep strategic stuff going on, and then it turns out it's like another layer deeper.

334
00:19:53,917 --> 00:19:55,538
This is just crazy, I love this.

335
00:19:57,822 --> 00:19:59,723
And so this was reflected in productivity.

336
00:19:59,863 --> 00:20:02,405
This is a quote from one of the guys at work, Fruity.

337
00:20:02,725 --> 00:20:04,606
Sorry, we use a lot of nicknames at Halfbrick,

338
00:20:04,626 --> 00:20:07,167
so all of these names sort of might seem a bit weird.

339
00:20:07,648 --> 00:20:08,848
So yeah, I would normally spend,

340
00:20:08,868 --> 00:20:11,610
normally have 11 or 12 tabs open in Spark,

341
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:13,651
which is our little internal messaging program,

342
00:20:14,011 --> 00:20:16,772
talking about the game for up to six hours of the day,

343
00:20:17,373 --> 00:20:18,073
every day.

344
00:20:19,428 --> 00:20:22,010
So these guys actually sent me through a bunch of chat logs.

345
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:25,552
Some of them are hilarious. I should put them up somewhere at some point,

346
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:28,493
but I didn't have enough time to fit it all into this presentation.

347
00:20:29,034 --> 00:20:31,315
But there's one great one from Fruity,

348
00:20:32,075 --> 00:20:35,257
and he's talking to—he's got like nine conversations on the fly.

349
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,738
It's really difficult to keep up with.

350
00:20:37,438 --> 00:20:37,999
And then he says,

351
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:42,221
ah, okay, that's probably enough of that. I should probably actually get stuck into work.

352
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:44,342
And the timestamp next to it says 3.30pm.

353
00:20:49,345 --> 00:20:51,246
And you know, people are getting so invested.

354
00:20:51,306 --> 00:20:52,286
This is another player.

355
00:20:52,306 --> 00:20:54,107
They've created this Excel sheet,

356
00:20:54,267 --> 00:20:56,788
and they're trying to track all the action points

357
00:20:56,868 --> 00:20:59,069
and which players they're with, and the two

358
00:20:59,129 --> 00:21:01,530
kind of different sides, understanding

359
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:04,132
the total pool of action points they have available.

360
00:21:04,672 --> 00:21:08,054
So what this really shows is that, at this point,

361
00:21:08,574 --> 00:21:11,335
the main currency isn't really action points at all.

362
00:21:11,455 --> 00:21:12,276
It's information.

363
00:21:12,796 --> 00:21:14,857
That's what people are really trying to get to.

364
00:21:16,778 --> 00:21:18,138
And that leads us to spies.

365
00:21:19,595 --> 00:21:22,736
So let's say, hypothetically, there are two players playing the game

366
00:21:23,016 --> 00:21:26,477
and they're in the kitchen chatting about it and talking about their potential plans.

367
00:21:26,938 --> 00:21:28,558
And say there's a third person in there,

368
00:21:28,918 --> 00:21:31,759
not involved in the game at all, just quietly making a coffee.

369
00:21:32,779 --> 00:21:34,440
That person might overhear things

370
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,701
and these things might be interesting to the players.

371
00:21:40,182 --> 00:21:42,923
So the players actually start recruiting spies.

372
00:21:45,488 --> 00:21:49,670
And there are up to five people who are not playing the game at all

373
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:51,591
who are relaying information.

374
00:21:51,631 --> 00:21:55,213
And then there's even double agents who are feeding fake information.

375
00:21:55,233 --> 00:21:58,534
And it is just incredible. It's just getting out of control.

376
00:21:59,355 --> 00:22:02,456
And it sort of starts to explain why players who weren't even,

377
00:22:02,856 --> 00:22:05,298
sorry, employees who weren't even part of the game,

378
00:22:05,318 --> 00:22:07,879
where, you know, really their time was getting impinged on a lot.

379
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,761
And the spies thing gets even crazier somehow.

380
00:22:13,777 --> 00:22:18,319
So this is a really poorly drawn map, top-down, of one section of the office.

381
00:22:19,399 --> 00:22:24,041
All of the brown tables, sorry, brown squares there are tables where people sit at.

382
00:22:24,641 --> 00:22:26,682
The green one is where the game is set up.

383
00:22:27,823 --> 00:22:30,924
Those blue lines there, that shows where the walls of that office are,

384
00:22:30,984 --> 00:22:33,365
and those walls are made of glass, as I mentioned before.

385
00:22:33,505 --> 00:22:35,866
Turns out, this is an important point.

386
00:22:36,346 --> 00:22:38,307
Because if you were going to employ a spy,

387
00:22:39,728 --> 00:22:42,889
the people sitting at these desks can see that table all day long.

388
00:22:44,058 --> 00:22:46,279
they always know what's going on in the game

389
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:50,082
they're just sitting there working away and if someone happens to walk into the

390
00:22:50,162 --> 00:22:52,964
office they can jump on and say hey guess what I think there's some shit

391
00:22:52,984 --> 00:22:53,564
going down

392
00:22:53,924 --> 00:22:57,107
you should probably jump over and check out and at first people were getting

393
00:22:57,167 --> 00:23:00,229
baffled by this they turn up to the room and then all of a sudden there's a crowd

394
00:23:00,249 --> 00:23:01,269
of like twenty people

395
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:02,510
instantly

396
00:23:04,267 --> 00:23:08,569
is just, you know, and you know, at this point it's pretty obvious the game has kind of,

397
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:11,731
it's not just a game anymore, it's infected the office.

398
00:23:12,352 --> 00:23:16,655
It's gone out of, it's not contained to this little room, it's running through the chat system, it's

399
00:23:17,595 --> 00:23:20,937
depending on where people are sitting in the office, it's just crazy.

400
00:23:23,659 --> 00:23:28,722
So then there's also things happening in the jury that I was completely blind to while the game was happening.

401
00:23:29,849 --> 00:23:33,834
Obviously, as I was saying, the jury is really important, because you want people to vote for you.

402
00:23:33,874 --> 00:23:37,519
That's how you are going to, you know, right at the end game, win the game.

403
00:23:37,979 --> 00:23:42,685
So it turns out there is an email thread among all the players running in secret.

404
00:23:43,626 --> 00:23:46,890
And in that email thread, people are running propaganda campaigns.

405
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:53,083
and giving you reasons why you should give them action points and not other people action points

406
00:23:53,263 --> 00:23:53,884
and it's just

407
00:23:54,884 --> 00:23:58,327
again, it's just like this whole other level of strategy that I had no idea

408
00:23:58,367 --> 00:24:01,329
and it certainly wasn't part of the original intention with the design

409
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:07,813
and then it starts getting even crazier. People create anonymous email accounts

410
00:24:08,273 --> 00:24:11,695
and they jump in on this thread and they're effectively poisoning the jury

411
00:24:11,735 --> 00:24:12,816
this one's pretty mild

412
00:24:12,896 --> 00:24:16,559
and you know, I've actually blacked out the names because I was talking to people about this

413
00:24:16,659 --> 00:24:16,959
and they've

414
00:24:17,639 --> 00:24:17,959
they felt

415
00:24:18,753 --> 00:24:20,934
deeply ashamed about what they were doing here.

416
00:24:21,515 --> 00:24:24,136
Because they're saying, you know, like, don't trust this person.

417
00:24:25,157 --> 00:24:27,918
And that might be one thing, but when you're in an office environment

418
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:31,561
and you're saying, you know, I'm not saying don't trust

419
00:24:32,161 --> 00:24:32,901
Game Master 69.

420
00:24:33,202 --> 00:24:36,704
This person's saying, don't trust Luke Muscat.

421
00:24:37,284 --> 00:24:38,045
He's a bastard.

422
00:24:39,606 --> 00:24:42,968
And so that's, you know, that's getting personal. That's very personal at that point.

423
00:24:45,309 --> 00:24:48,331
So what was it about the game that made everyone go crazy, I wondered?

424
00:24:49,574 --> 00:24:53,015
definitely the context is a big deal. I mean, I'm certainly not blind to that.

425
00:24:53,055 --> 00:24:56,036
The fact that it happened in the office, among friends,

426
00:24:56,476 --> 00:24:58,717
that's going to make a really big change to it.

427
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,698
But I don't think that's the entire blame.

428
00:25:01,018 --> 00:25:05,059
I mean, we play games at Halfbrick all of the time, constantly.

429
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:09,120
That's mostly what we do. We play video games, we play poker every Friday night,

430
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,981
we've had three-month-long 500 tournaments.

431
00:25:13,022 --> 00:25:14,803
Every game you can imagine, we've played it,

432
00:25:15,524 --> 00:25:17,746
and it's never had an effect like this on The Office.

433
00:25:18,026 --> 00:25:20,709
So in this case, I really don't think the context can be blamed.

434
00:25:20,749 --> 00:25:24,793
I think the context is just an amplifier that increased everything that happened.

435
00:25:27,255 --> 00:25:29,517
The time investment, I think, was a really big thing too.

436
00:25:30,178 --> 00:25:32,881
Don't you love how literal Google image search is sometimes?

437
00:25:32,901 --> 00:25:37,765
You're gonna search time investment and you get a clock sitting on the word investing.

438
00:25:39,915 --> 00:25:44,117
I mean, by the time you've put in five or six or seven days worth of

439
00:25:44,758 --> 00:25:47,919
work into this game, you know, you've built up these relationships

440
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,381
even though, like, at first it's just this arbitrary thing and it's just little

441
00:25:52,001 --> 00:25:55,803
pieces of paper sliding around, some other paper, they begin to develop meaning.

442
00:25:56,244 --> 00:25:58,465
The time really, really makes a big difference.

443
00:26:00,366 --> 00:26:04,127
But then I think there were some really key rules that really set this whole thing off.

444
00:26:04,168 --> 00:26:05,868
I'm going to go through a couple of them really quick.

445
00:26:07,756 --> 00:26:11,059
The daisy-chaining implications is really, I think, the biggest culprit here.

446
00:26:11,239 --> 00:26:13,801
So this is the same image as before,

447
00:26:14,602 --> 00:26:16,463
just with arrows so you can see it visually.

448
00:26:16,903 --> 00:26:20,667
So what's interesting in most games, if you decide you don't want to be a part of an alliance,

449
00:26:20,727 --> 00:26:22,228
fine, you're out of that alliance.

450
00:26:22,308 --> 00:26:24,850
And you know, it might have been a four-person alliance before,

451
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:27,632
but now you're on the edge and it's a three-person alliance.

452
00:26:28,533 --> 00:26:32,596
But look what happens in this game if you decide you don't want to be a part of the alliance.

453
00:26:33,791 --> 00:26:35,953
This purple player here has decided to opt out.

454
00:26:36,634 --> 00:26:38,716
They have completely destroyed this chain.

455
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:41,879
They've really caused massive disruption

456
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,841
to the strategies of these guys.

457
00:26:45,755 --> 00:26:48,479
And I mean, this is basically peer pressure 101, right?

458
00:26:49,179 --> 00:26:52,203
If you say, I'm not going to be a part of this, and then that

459
00:26:52,423 --> 00:26:55,727
pisses off nine other people and completely—there's something they're going to feel

460
00:26:55,767 --> 00:26:59,852
passionate about, this big, grand strategy, and you're the one thing getting in the

461
00:26:59,892 --> 00:27:01,093
way of that happening.

462
00:27:01,654 --> 00:27:03,436
Imagine the pressure you feel about that.

463
00:27:05,246 --> 00:27:07,568
Yeah, I mean, join us or die, pretty much.

464
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:10,350
And even then, you know, you could not join

465
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:11,852
and you'd probably get killed straight away

466
00:27:11,872 --> 00:27:13,133
and then it would form back around you.

467
00:27:13,153 --> 00:27:14,914
There's literally nothing to incentivise you

468
00:27:14,954 --> 00:27:16,696
from straying away from the major group.

469
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,623
The zero randomness thing was interesting too, because

470
00:27:21,983 --> 00:27:24,565
when you have three action points and you're in range of someone,

471
00:27:24,866 --> 00:27:28,449
guaranteed, 100%, you could kill that person and take them out of the game.

472
00:27:29,169 --> 00:27:30,951
There's no randomness. There's no, you know,

473
00:27:30,971 --> 00:27:33,793
oh, you got a lucky shot, that's cool. There's no,

474
00:27:33,874 --> 00:27:35,475
you know, oh, that was unlucky for you.

475
00:27:35,875 --> 00:27:38,037
The reason I have a screenshot of Fruit Ninja here is,

476
00:27:38,318 --> 00:27:39,559
this is something that, you know,

477
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:46,009
The role of randomness is something we're very interested in, and what we do in Fruit Ninja is deliberately put bombs

478
00:27:46,569 --> 00:27:50,115
overlapping fruit sometimes, and create unfair situations randomly.

479
00:27:50,516 --> 00:27:53,941
The reason is, is unless you're really skilled, you're probably going to slice the bomb and die.

480
00:27:55,049 --> 00:28:01,095
And this means you get to place some of the blame and some of the burden that you're feeling onto the game itself.

481
00:28:01,595 --> 00:28:04,638
You say to yourself, I could have got a high score if it wasn't for that bomb there.

482
00:28:04,998 --> 00:28:07,120
Or sometimes, you know, I got a really lucky run.

483
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,524
And when you do that in a competitive environment, it really takes the edge off.

484
00:28:11,944 --> 00:28:18,230
It's the same as in poker, you know, you'll be all playing and someone's just bluffing and rising and rising,

485
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:20,291
and then all of a sudden they get something on the river.

486
00:28:20,552 --> 00:28:24,259
and it's hilarious, everyone laughs and it's a good fun interaction.

487
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:30,129
This had none of that, it was all just pure clinical, you know, no randomness at all.

488
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:35,993
I also had a theory about the jury, which I sort of mentioned before, that because it

489
00:28:36,013 --> 00:28:40,196
was real people, this had a really big effect on the game, and you're actually personally

490
00:28:40,256 --> 00:28:44,740
attacking people, and it really blurs the lines between the relationship you have in

491
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,282
the game versus the relationship you have in the office.

492
00:28:48,162 --> 00:28:51,405
Most of the guys at Halfbrick are really good friends as well, they go out on the weekends

493
00:28:51,445 --> 00:28:56,269
together, and so it was really making a lot of worlds collide and really causing a lot

494
00:28:56,309 --> 00:28:56,649
of stress.

495
00:28:58,953 --> 00:29:01,636
So originally this was the end of my talk. When I pitched

496
00:29:02,116 --> 00:29:03,858
this talk to the GDC board

497
00:29:04,699 --> 00:29:07,742
I said, you know, I'm basically going to tell a story and tell how it all goes.

498
00:29:08,483 --> 00:29:11,686
And then they sort of encouraged me to, instead of doing a twenty-five minute talk

499
00:29:11,726 --> 00:29:16,071
about that, actually fill it out to an hour and explore some other games and all of that.

500
00:29:16,712 --> 00:29:19,393
So I said, okay, cool, that sounds interesting, let's do that.

501
00:29:19,533 --> 00:29:24,176
And it was actually been a really interesting process for me by doing this.

502
00:29:24,236 --> 00:29:26,517
It's really, I'm really glad they pushed me to do it, because

503
00:29:27,338 --> 00:29:30,659
I've had a lot of time to go through and look at other games and, you know, really

504
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,281
do some thinking about what I was doing with the game

505
00:29:34,321 --> 00:29:36,983
and how I feel about how everything went down.

506
00:29:39,264 --> 00:29:42,166
So, I wanted to look at a couple of other games that make people crazy.

507
00:29:43,106 --> 00:29:44,327
Who's played Neptune's Pride?

508
00:29:45,743 --> 00:29:48,505
I have not very, not many people at all. Okay, I'm glad that

509
00:29:48,805 --> 00:29:50,966
I have a little thing here that explains how it works.

510
00:29:51,427 --> 00:29:53,568
It's a free browser-based strategy game.

511
00:29:54,589 --> 00:29:55,629
It's very simple. This is

512
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:59,132
kind of a simplification of the rules. You know, you capture stars by moving

513
00:29:59,172 --> 00:29:59,772
around ships.

514
00:30:00,433 --> 00:30:04,395
You collect money every twenty-four hours, similar to the game I did.

515
00:30:04,976 --> 00:30:07,997
And you can invest that money to produce either economy or industry.

516
00:30:08,458 --> 00:30:12,601
If you invest in economy, you get more money next payday, next twenty-four hours.

517
00:30:13,401 --> 00:30:14,541
industry generates ships.

518
00:30:15,122 --> 00:30:17,963
And is the first to capture, 50% of the stars wins.

519
00:30:18,603 --> 00:30:20,664
Again, it's very simple, very clinical.

520
00:30:21,504 --> 00:30:25,225
If you have, if you're on the same kind of weapon level and, you know,

521
00:30:25,305 --> 00:30:27,066
80 ships attacks 100 ships, then

522
00:30:27,466 --> 00:30:31,168
the 100 ships wins and have 20 ships left over. It's just an algorithm.

523
00:30:33,309 --> 00:30:38,030
And it's amazing. So this is a great quote straight off the Neptune's Pride website.

524
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,051
The most horrible game you will ever play.

525
00:30:40,611 --> 00:30:41,232
It is brilliant.

526
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:46,092
And there's a lot of similarities here with the prototype.

527
00:30:46,432 --> 00:30:50,275
There's a constant influx of actionable points that you can do whenever you want,

528
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:51,816
because effectively Neptune's pride,

529
00:30:52,196 --> 00:30:54,498
and it takes even longer to play out, up to a month.

530
00:30:55,138 --> 00:30:56,719
But it's effectively real time.

531
00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:01,062
Moving between the stars can take like three days because of how slow everything moves.

532
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:05,331
You can execute it anytime. There's an abstract representation, you know.

533
00:31:05,711 --> 00:31:09,293
Just like how we had little squares of people's names on it,

534
00:31:09,953 --> 00:31:13,074
this has little circles and triangles representing stars and ships.

535
00:31:13,794 --> 00:31:15,414
Really heavy focus on deployment.

536
00:31:16,015 --> 00:31:18,975
No randomness and time investment. These are all very similar.

537
00:31:19,596 --> 00:31:23,697
There's a lot of differences as well, but there's definitely some, you know, repeating kind of themes here.

538
00:31:25,037 --> 00:31:27,838
The first time I played a game, it was probably about a year ago.

539
00:31:27,858 --> 00:31:30,939
It was an eight-player game. I knew three of the players and it was the most

540
00:31:32,187 --> 00:31:34,228
terrifying, horrible experience

541
00:31:34,789 --> 00:31:38,470
of playing a game that I've ever had, but so, so memorable.

542
00:31:38,991 --> 00:31:40,151
So incredibly memorable.

543
00:31:40,711 --> 00:31:43,633
And a similar thing happened where, as I was playing, you know, at first you don't

544
00:31:43,653 --> 00:31:47,255
really care, but then the time investment gets in, and you're getting more and more

545
00:31:47,335 --> 00:31:49,936
into it, and you're messaging all of the other players, and

546
00:31:50,256 --> 00:31:51,917
getting ready to backstab someone.

547
00:31:52,397 --> 00:31:55,439
And then at some point, this is right near the end of the game, one of the

548
00:31:55,479 --> 00:31:57,220
friends I was playing with rings me at

549
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:57,440
4am.

550
00:31:59,123 --> 00:32:00,903
in the morning and wakes me up and he says,

551
00:32:00,943 --> 00:32:03,864
look, I know it's 4am, but we need to do something right now.

552
00:32:04,004 --> 00:32:05,505
We're about to lose this game.

553
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:08,606
So much for being able to play whenever you want.

554
00:32:10,447 --> 00:32:13,067
So I played a second game leading up to this GDC talk,

555
00:32:13,087 --> 00:32:14,328
because I thought that would be a good idea.

556
00:32:14,388 --> 00:32:16,709
I should refresh myself on how the game works.

557
00:32:17,649 --> 00:32:20,150
And it was just as horrible as last time.

558
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:24,691
I had a couple of theories that I wanted to test out

559
00:32:24,751 --> 00:32:25,892
by playing the game again.

560
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:27,012
One of them was that.

561
00:32:29,195 --> 00:32:33,199
This is the actual chat log from like two days ago that I just screen capped out.

562
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:38,545
One of the theories I had was maybe what we should do is everyone assume an alias

563
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:42,749
and no one will know who anyone is, and then nothing will hurt quite as bad.

564
00:32:42,789 --> 00:32:44,191
It won't feel so personal.

565
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:47,034
So we had eight friends all jump in on this game,

566
00:32:47,074 --> 00:32:49,997
and we all set these crazy aliases so no one would be able to...

567
00:32:50,737 --> 00:32:54,541
be able to do it. But the same thing happened again. You know, we'd be talking about the game

568
00:32:55,141 --> 00:33:01,047
on gtalk and in person, and you know, slowly the game seeps out into the real world.

569
00:33:01,925 --> 00:33:05,047
And then soon enough, you start figuring out who is who.

570
00:33:05,487 --> 00:33:07,228
And by this point, I'm not saying,

571
00:33:07,628 --> 00:33:08,969
I'm going to attack the red guy.

572
00:33:09,089 --> 00:33:11,130
I'm literally saying, I'm going to attack Jonathan.

573
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:13,671
And he's literally communicating to me

574
00:33:13,711 --> 00:33:15,152
that he's sorry for attacking me.

575
00:33:15,552 --> 00:33:18,033
So that whole theory kind of just went up in my face.

576
00:33:18,093 --> 00:33:19,974
And it was just as horrible as last time.

577
00:33:20,034 --> 00:33:21,515
It just kind of kicked in a bit later.

578
00:33:23,823 --> 00:33:26,705
And it's because the rules are so evocative.

579
00:33:26,965 --> 00:33:30,007
It's nothing to do with the theme. It wouldn't matter if it was in space.

580
00:33:30,047 --> 00:33:32,769
It wouldn't matter if it looked as terrible as my prototype did.

581
00:33:32,809 --> 00:33:34,650
The rules are just so evocative.

582
00:33:35,611 --> 00:33:38,993
So with this screenshot here, this was from about a week and a half ago.

583
00:33:39,013 --> 00:33:43,536
I woke up in the morning and checked the game to see what was happening.

584
00:33:43,576 --> 00:33:45,337
And this is the screen I opened up to.

585
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:46,718
I was the blue player.

586
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:50,481
And I felt physically sick looking at this screen.

587
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:57,133
And without any context, you're looking at this and it just looks like a bunch of ships moving around, but this represented to me

588
00:33:57,553 --> 00:33:59,234
three weeks worth of work

589
00:33:59,514 --> 00:34:03,576
that was about to turn on me. I could tell by the way that the ships were moving around

590
00:34:03,856 --> 00:34:06,057
that I was about to get backstabbed big time

591
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:07,198
by my friends.

592
00:34:07,698 --> 00:34:13,221
And I saw this screen and oh my god, like my chest was tightening up, I thought I was going to have a stroke.

593
00:34:13,701 --> 00:34:17,323
It's such a powerful actual physical reaction to the game.

594
00:34:18,063 --> 00:34:20,105
And again, just because the rules are so evocative.

595
00:34:21,603 --> 00:34:26,464
And I decided, you know, I really started thinking about this engagement versus fun idea.

596
00:34:26,964 --> 00:34:33,286
When I was doing the prototype, I just wanted something that was exciting and as compelling as possible at any costs, like I said.

597
00:34:34,086 --> 00:34:41,709
But there's definitely a correlation here between the game being exciting and compelling and it being, having negative feelings as well, it being, making you feel paranoid.

598
00:34:42,809 --> 00:34:44,870
So I really wanted to find out a bit more about that.

599
00:34:46,581 --> 00:34:50,042
So what happened was I got onto the Neptune's Pride website,

600
00:34:50,082 --> 00:34:52,663
and I sent an email to the developer and said,

601
00:34:52,703 --> 00:34:55,224
hey, I'm doing this GDC talk.

602
00:34:55,804 --> 00:34:57,285
I really think I want to have a big section

603
00:34:57,305 --> 00:34:58,565
about Neptune's Pride in it.

604
00:34:58,625 --> 00:35:00,066
Would you be available to have a chat

605
00:35:00,126 --> 00:35:01,566
on Skype or something sometime?

606
00:35:02,623 --> 00:35:04,564
And the person gets back to me, his name is Jay.

607
00:35:05,305 --> 00:35:07,186
And he goes to me like, oh yeah, that's cool,

608
00:35:07,206 --> 00:35:09,287
we should meet up and have a beer, I live up the road.

609
00:35:10,248 --> 00:35:11,689
Now this might happen all the time

610
00:35:11,729 --> 00:35:13,110
if you live in San Francisco,

611
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:16,072
but this does not happen in Australia, in Brisbane,

612
00:35:16,152 --> 00:35:16,713
that's for sure.

613
00:35:18,303 --> 00:35:21,426
So, I met up with Jay, and I had some questions for him.

614
00:35:21,446 --> 00:35:25,210
You know, he's a really good guy, really smart, really knows what he's doing.

615
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:29,134
And I asked him about, you know, what his intent was when he was making the game.

616
00:35:29,214 --> 00:35:31,456
He didn't mean for it to be so intense.

617
00:35:31,777 --> 00:35:36,982
He didn't mean for it to, you know, bring out such these amazing, strong feelings in people.

618
00:35:37,723 --> 00:35:39,464
But I had a particular question in mind.

619
00:35:40,685 --> 00:35:48,267
that I wanted to ask him about. So on edge.com, Neptune's Pride got given this award for the most effective tool for ending friendships.

620
00:35:50,067 --> 00:35:51,448
And so I said to Jay, you know,

621
00:35:52,148 --> 00:35:53,488
how does it make you feel

622
00:35:54,108 --> 00:35:57,689
when you see this? You know, what do you, how do you respond to seeing this comment?

623
00:35:58,469 --> 00:36:01,310
This is what he said, this is slightly paraphrased. That's awesome.

624
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:05,011
The game made an impact. It obviously made an impact on you as well.

625
00:36:05,611 --> 00:36:07,651
Making an impact is why we make games.

626
00:36:08,232 --> 00:36:11,173
And this is really amazing for me. You know, I was listening to him and

627
00:36:11,533 --> 00:36:14,774
you know, he did mention that there were some things that he wasn't happy about

628
00:36:15,094 --> 00:36:18,936
such as it's difficult to make the game really popular because most people only

629
00:36:18,956 --> 00:36:19,836
want to play it once.

630
00:36:22,878 --> 00:36:26,519
He also mentioned a particular scenario where players have

631
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:31,961
emailed him asking him to block their account so they can't come back and play it again.

632
00:36:33,454 --> 00:36:35,835
Just like, you know, gambling addicts, I guess.

633
00:36:36,715 --> 00:36:39,136
But, you know, his main sentiment here was that, you know, he's

634
00:36:39,617 --> 00:36:41,998
so happy that the game had such a big impact.

635
00:36:43,238 --> 00:36:46,680
And so after I had this beer with him, I sort of went away, and I was really thinking,

636
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,801
and, you know, really reflecting on myself,

637
00:36:49,421 --> 00:36:49,922
going, you know,

638
00:36:50,362 --> 00:36:55,144
so, you know, making games, making impact, that's why we do it. Is that why I make games?

639
00:36:55,184 --> 00:36:55,984
To make an impact?

640
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:59,050
I guess kind of my goal was to make an impact

641
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:02,211
when I look back at what my main goals were for the prototype.

642
00:37:03,011 --> 00:37:04,672
But I'm not sure that's the whole story for me.

643
00:37:05,252 --> 00:37:07,152
I don't think it's impact at any cost.

644
00:37:07,192 --> 00:37:09,693
If I wanted to make an impact, I could just stab someone in the leg.

645
00:37:10,893 --> 00:37:12,954
That would be one way to make an impact, that's for sure.

646
00:37:15,995 --> 00:37:18,875
So another set of game rules that make people go crazy is

647
00:37:19,316 --> 00:37:21,696
Dota, League of Legends, and all of the MOBAs.

648
00:37:21,836 --> 00:37:25,357
And I'm sure most people here are pretty familiar with the infamy.

649
00:37:26,063 --> 00:37:29,667
that comes along with the communities in these games.

650
00:37:30,428 --> 00:37:31,669
So before I'd done this talk,

651
00:37:31,889 --> 00:37:34,712
you know, when the GDC board said you should check out some other games,

652
00:37:34,732 --> 00:37:37,655
they said, you know, you've got to do a section about either Dota or LoL.

653
00:37:37,735 --> 00:37:40,978
You know, it's infamously toxic. You really need to find out about it.

654
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:44,221
I'd never played the games at all. I didn't even understand how they worked.

655
00:37:46,077 --> 00:37:51,402
Just to give a really, really quick overview for anyone who's not familiar with how the game works.

656
00:37:51,783 --> 00:37:56,387
And this is a gross simplification of what is a very rich, very complex genre.

657
00:37:56,827 --> 00:37:59,910
But basically you have a few heroes per side.

658
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:03,314
You go and you kill guys, and when you kill guys you level up and get stronger.

659
00:38:03,334 --> 00:38:08,619
And your goal is to destroy the other team's base, and defending that base, there's turrets.

660
00:38:09,307 --> 00:38:12,470
I'm really sorry for everyone who plays this game a lot. I know that's such a

661
00:38:12,911 --> 00:38:15,834
simple version, but you could do a whole talk just about this.

662
00:38:17,485 --> 00:38:21,428
And you know, this is a great quote. This is from Idle Thumbs recently.

663
00:38:21,448 --> 00:38:25,332
And it really kind of sums up about when people are playing Dota.

664
00:38:25,492 --> 00:38:27,994
You know, I think I just lose my mind when I'm playing Dota.

665
00:38:28,134 --> 00:38:30,496
I forget who I even am. I'm like the Hulk.

666
00:38:31,277 --> 00:38:33,238
And you know, this is something you see a lot of.

667
00:38:33,418 --> 00:38:37,442
You jump on the forums and it's all people talking about how terrible the community is

668
00:38:37,502 --> 00:38:40,344
and how enraged everyone is and that everyone needs to relax.

669
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:46,840
So a guy called Jeffrey Lin is doing a lot of interesting stuff here.

670
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,387
He did a really fantastic presentation, I think it was on Wednesday, maybe?

671
00:38:52,128 --> 00:38:54,812
Really excellent. He's the lead behavior science guy.

672
00:38:54,992 --> 00:38:57,436
He's got a more official title than that, but I don't remember what it is.

673
00:38:58,577 --> 00:39:02,838
And he's doing some really great stuff leading a team, trying to figure out how to make League of Legends

674
00:39:03,138 --> 00:39:04,979
much less toxic than it currently is.

675
00:39:05,739 --> 00:39:11,280
But what's interesting is, you know, what he's focusing on isn't really about changing the gameplay and the rules itself,

676
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,501
it's all of the meta-systems that surround it.

677
00:39:14,261 --> 00:39:19,482
So, you know, he's looking at doing tribunals to punish players, and honor to reward good players.

678
00:39:19,842 --> 00:39:25,623
But I really wanted to look at those core kind of rules and figure out why this happens in the first place.

679
00:39:27,428 --> 00:39:30,231
And again, we start to see a couple of similarities here.

680
00:39:30,271 --> 00:39:33,253
The time investment to play a game of League of Legends is high.

681
00:39:33,433 --> 00:39:34,374
It takes a long time.

682
00:39:34,995 --> 00:39:37,817
Not one month long time, but it's still, you know,

683
00:39:37,877 --> 00:39:39,678
probably by the time you open the game,

684
00:39:40,379 --> 00:39:41,960
can take up to a solid hour.

685
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:44,863
And during that hour, you have to be 100% focused.

686
00:39:44,903 --> 00:39:46,564
You get that time investment effect.

687
00:39:47,915 --> 00:39:51,597
and you know if you're playing a game of Counter-Strike or whatever you could play a game for an hour

688
00:39:51,637 --> 00:39:55,939
but you might cycle through a whole set of players and you know people dropping in and dropping out

689
00:39:55,999 --> 00:39:57,980
but that can't happen in League of Legends

690
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,100
not at all

691
00:39:59,721 --> 00:40:03,102
in there the players are leveling up and so you know if someone's been playing for half an hour

692
00:40:03,142 --> 00:40:04,143
and then they drop out

693
00:40:04,403 --> 00:40:07,645
I mean what are you going to do? Add a new player that's back on level one?

694
00:40:07,685 --> 00:40:08,765
That's not going to work out

695
00:40:11,287 --> 00:40:12,968
and every player is a vital link.

696
00:40:13,268 --> 00:40:16,410
And again, this really reminded me of the whole peer pressure kind of thing,

697
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:17,550
but in a different way.

698
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:24,074
With only five players per team, if someone isn't performing at their best,

699
00:40:24,094 --> 00:40:26,896
you know, say they're only playing at half their ability,

700
00:40:26,976 --> 00:40:31,018
that takes your team from a hundred percent effective to ninety percent effective.

701
00:40:31,438 --> 00:40:35,181
And that's a big deal, you know, the team is really relying on every player to play

702
00:40:35,261 --> 00:40:38,623
well and do well to win in the game, and you want to win.

703
00:40:39,043 --> 00:40:42,445
Because you're putting a whole hour of unbroken time into that game.

704
00:40:45,106 --> 00:40:51,089
But more than all of this, I think what is really the crux of it is the underpinning structure

705
00:40:51,109 --> 00:40:56,252
of the game experience. And that's what I think creates such intensity in the player behavior.

706
00:40:56,292 --> 00:40:58,953
And I want to use the word intensity here, not toxicity.

707
00:40:59,773 --> 00:41:02,515
Because the intensity means, you know, you get those really toxic players,

708
00:41:02,775 --> 00:41:05,196
but then you get the guys who just love the game and, you know,

709
00:41:05,236 --> 00:41:07,257
do really great things in the community as well.

710
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:13,476
So I think what it comes down to is this. There's a really big positive feedback loop in this game.

711
00:41:13,797 --> 00:41:17,301
You kill stuff which lets you level up, which lets you kill stuff easier.

712
00:41:17,922 --> 00:41:20,726
Again, sorry for the very simple, you know, oversimplification.

713
00:41:22,128 --> 00:41:24,751
Pushing against this, though, is the defensive advantage.

714
00:41:25,782 --> 00:41:28,003
So as you push into the person's territory,

715
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:31,665
as you're gaining the advantage and you're able to attack more and more and you push

716
00:41:31,685 --> 00:41:35,086
towards their base, they gain a defensive advantage through the turrets which are

717
00:41:35,106 --> 00:41:35,927
helping them defend

718
00:41:36,287 --> 00:41:39,088
and the fact that they're closer to their base so they can get there faster

719
00:41:39,148 --> 00:41:40,149
after they respawn.

720
00:41:40,669 --> 00:41:44,151
And, you know, there's a whole bunch of mechanics there that give the defenders

721
00:41:44,211 --> 00:41:44,911
an advantage.

722
00:41:45,431 --> 00:41:49,313
And so you get this scenario where you have these two forces pushing against

723
00:41:49,413 --> 00:41:49,833
each other.

724
00:41:50,413 --> 00:41:56,118
You have the ever-increasing positive feedback loop of leveling up, leveling up, leveling up, getting stronger and stronger.

725
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:59,440
And then that's getting it pushed in the other way from the defensive advantage.

726
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:04,524
And you know, when you're pressing a defensive advantage, you probably get a few kills, so then you start to level up.

727
00:42:05,004 --> 00:42:08,446
And these two forces are kind of pushing back and forth against each other.

728
00:42:09,967 --> 00:42:13,710
And then at some point, maybe about 60-70% of the way through the game,

729
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:15,331
you hit the tipping point.

730
00:42:16,235 --> 00:42:18,777
And all of a sudden, the positive feedback loop

731
00:42:19,277 --> 00:42:21,699
manages to overcome the defensive advantage.

732
00:42:22,119 --> 00:42:27,022
And after this point, the game is, in most scenarios,

733
00:42:27,122 --> 00:42:28,102
as good as lost.

734
00:42:28,522 --> 00:42:30,103
And the thing is, is this tipping point

735
00:42:30,664 --> 00:42:32,385
happens at a very specific time.

736
00:42:33,045 --> 00:42:35,306
Usually, experienced players especially,

737
00:42:35,366 --> 00:42:37,227
who can kind of see the entire game

738
00:42:37,267 --> 00:42:38,788
and understand everything that's going on,

739
00:42:38,828 --> 00:42:41,150
can see that moment when that happens.

740
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:44,271
And all of a sudden, one side has the advantage.

741
00:42:46,284 --> 00:42:50,060
And the thing is, once you have that advantage, it's not like the game is over straight away.

742
00:42:50,984 --> 00:42:55,888
If you're on the losing side, you're now going to get your ass beaten for a solid five minutes.

743
00:42:56,069 --> 00:42:58,911
You're just going to get swarmed over and over and over.

744
00:42:59,432 --> 00:43:02,995
And you know, that really doesn't feel good. They really punish you once you hit that point.

745
00:43:03,335 --> 00:43:06,778
I mean, this is what it looks like when your Nexus is getting destroyed,

746
00:43:06,798 --> 00:43:10,441
and there's just so many minions and champs just all over you.

747
00:43:10,481 --> 00:43:13,544
You generally spawn and get completely destroyed instantly.

748
00:43:14,225 --> 00:43:17,808
And you can see this kind of positive feedback loop in this.

749
00:43:18,673 --> 00:43:21,536
I got this screenshot, you know, straight off Google images,

750
00:43:21,836 --> 00:43:24,218
and if you look up closely, you can see in the corner, you know,

751
00:43:24,339 --> 00:43:28,643
one player is just really pressing that advantage with the positive feedback loop

752
00:43:28,683 --> 00:43:30,485
and just getting kill after kill after kill.

753
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,741
And to really rub salt into the wounds near the end.

754
00:43:36,261 --> 00:43:37,722
Oh, sorry, yeah, the blame game.

755
00:43:38,162 --> 00:43:40,022
If it happens at this particular tipping point,

756
00:43:40,183 --> 00:43:42,663
it's really easy to blame someone in particular, right?

757
00:43:43,083 --> 00:43:45,364
You know, you say, ah, if this person hadn't have done that thing,

758
00:43:45,484 --> 00:43:47,404
even though you'd been working together as a team

759
00:43:47,444 --> 00:43:49,125
for a solid half an hour, maybe,

760
00:43:49,885 --> 00:43:52,886
you hit that tipping point and all of a sudden it's one person's fault.

761
00:43:53,406 --> 00:43:57,087
And to make it worse, the best time for you to express that...

762
00:43:59,156 --> 00:44:02,918
is when you have the least amount of things competing for your attention,

763
00:44:03,238 --> 00:44:04,058
which is when you're dead.

764
00:44:04,678 --> 00:44:08,520
So if you've just died, you're probably not in a great state of mind

765
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:12,222
and in a really good mood to be communicating with some other people.

766
00:44:15,583 --> 00:44:16,364
All of that said,

767
00:44:17,364 --> 00:44:19,425
I'm not going to let the players completely off the hook.

768
00:44:20,185 --> 00:44:22,747
The players definitely have to wear some of the responsibility.

769
00:44:23,707 --> 00:44:27,869
And for me, the example that sums this up the best of all games is Monopoly.

770
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:32,783
So if you're like a nuclear 1950s family playing Monopoly,

771
00:44:32,983 --> 00:44:35,564
it's probably going to be quite, you know, quite nice.

772
00:44:35,604 --> 00:44:38,486
You're playing, it's pleasant, the rules, and you know,

773
00:44:38,546 --> 00:44:41,988
oh, you get some good wins and you get some unlucky losses

774
00:44:42,048 --> 00:44:42,849
and things like that.

775
00:44:43,589 --> 00:44:45,290
But then you play a game against Monopoly

776
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:47,352
with a group of people who are all about those,

777
00:44:47,372 --> 00:44:50,474
like the under the table deals, the deal cutting,

778
00:44:50,514 --> 00:44:53,075
the, you know, the bargaining, the ransoms,

779
00:44:53,115 --> 00:44:54,476
you know, I'm taking this property

780
00:44:54,516 --> 00:44:56,477
and you've gotta pay me some exorbitant amount of money.

781
00:44:57,418 --> 00:45:00,639
That game is very different. It has a very different feeling.

782
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:04,541
It really changes the game. The rules have stayed the same.

783
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:08,303
But the players have changed and the game feels different.

784
00:45:08,403 --> 00:45:10,984
So I'm not going to let the players completely off the hook on this one.

785
00:45:11,004 --> 00:45:12,765
They definitely have some responsibility.

786
00:45:15,327 --> 00:45:18,628
So, getting towards the end here, I have some conclusions.

787
00:45:21,149 --> 00:45:22,930
Through all of this, I learned a lot.

788
00:45:24,463 --> 00:45:28,226
you know, I didn't just learn about game design through analyzing this and, you know,

789
00:45:28,607 --> 00:45:29,988
I just loved the fact that

790
00:45:30,348 --> 00:45:34,391
having to prepare for this talk really made me reflect on myself as a designer.

791
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:37,814
So I learned a lot about game design in general and, you know,

792
00:45:38,074 --> 00:45:41,437
played some new games and, you know, really got to spend some time analyzing them.

793
00:45:41,537 --> 00:45:43,879
I learned a lot about players, about how they respond,

794
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:47,582
about how players are really smart and really good at taking your rules and

795
00:45:47,662 --> 00:45:50,825
twisting them and coming up with ways to kind of subvert the game.

796
00:45:51,685 --> 00:45:53,727
But I also learned a lot about myself as a designer.

797
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:57,652
Game design is really powerful.

798
00:45:57,672 --> 00:46:00,336
Like, really, really, really powerful.

799
00:46:00,456 --> 00:46:03,059
Just the pure mechanics of the game have the ability

800
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:07,385
to completely change people and the way that they act.

801
00:46:08,026 --> 00:46:10,309
And I think this is something that I hadn't really respected

802
00:46:10,369 --> 00:46:11,731
before I did this prototype.

803
00:46:11,891 --> 00:46:13,834
I was, you know, as I said at the beginning.

804
00:46:15,084 --> 00:46:18,225
I wanted the game to be as engaging as possible at any cost.

805
00:46:18,965 --> 00:46:22,766
And I hadn't really thought about that that much and how well I would, you know,

806
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:24,426
how compelling something could be

807
00:46:25,086 --> 00:46:28,307
and just how powerful the pure mechanics of the game could be.

808
00:46:28,907 --> 00:46:32,907
I was really thinking, you know, how could it have any possible problems?

809
00:46:33,288 --> 00:46:36,448
It's just little bits of whiteboard on some printed-off paper.

810
00:46:36,768 --> 00:46:38,609
How could it get that bad?

811
00:46:39,569 --> 00:46:41,989
Game design is very powerful, just the pure mechanics.

812
00:46:42,129 --> 00:46:44,230
And again, Neptune's Pride shows that as well.

813
00:46:45,551 --> 00:46:52,714
I learned a lot about players as well, about how they react, and how, I guess if anything,

814
00:46:52,794 --> 00:46:56,335
I learned how much I don't know about them and how unpredictable they are.

815
00:46:57,715 --> 00:47:02,877
And finally, I learned a lot about myself as well, and realized I'd never really taken

816
00:47:02,917 --> 00:47:08,519
time as a designer to stop and think and look kind of introspectively at what I was doing

817
00:47:08,779 --> 00:47:09,800
and what my goals were.

818
00:47:11,514 --> 00:47:20,117
After doing all this and doing all this process, you know, I really think, you know, I still want to make a very compelling, very engaging game, but I'm no longer willing to do it at any cost.

819
00:47:20,797 --> 00:47:30,240
If it's going to be compelling and engaging, the thing I want the players to take away from the game is the positive experiences they had. I want them to be at the pub talking about that great thing they did together

820
00:47:30,801 --> 00:47:34,102
and not kind of mourning over the terrible thing that happened to them.

821
00:47:35,462 --> 00:47:38,983
And for me, these are really, you know, my first steps. I've been doing game design for...

822
00:47:39,881 --> 00:47:42,382
not long compared to a lot of people, but six and a half years.

823
00:47:42,422 --> 00:47:46,704
This is really the first time I've thought hard about what I'm trying to achieve as a designer

824
00:47:47,264 --> 00:47:48,885
and, you know, where my limits are.

825
00:47:51,726 --> 00:47:53,707
The prototype, Tank Turns Tactics, will live on.

826
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:56,048
I'm going to do it again at some point.

827
00:47:56,328 --> 00:47:58,629
I've actually tried to do it a couple of times, but

828
00:47:59,069 --> 00:48:02,010
I haven't figured out a way to do it without destroying the office again.

829
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:05,712
One potential idea is to take it down to the university and destroy them.

830
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:11,309
Alternatively, I could test it out at rival game companies.

831
00:48:11,529 --> 00:48:12,910
That might work out OK, too.

832
00:48:14,732 --> 00:48:17,533
But I want to change it to make it a more positive experience,

833
00:48:17,594 --> 00:48:18,094
eventually.

834
00:48:18,134 --> 00:48:20,435
I really think that there's something powerful here,

835
00:48:20,475 --> 00:48:23,037
and I've kind of accidentally stumbled across something

836
00:48:23,077 --> 00:48:23,838
really interesting.

837
00:48:24,218 --> 00:48:25,659
I just don't know how to get it there yet.

838
00:48:25,719 --> 00:48:27,360
I'm still thinking about it.

839
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:29,842
I have some ideas, but yes.

840
00:48:31,583 --> 00:48:34,785
So anyway, that's my story about a crazy game experiment.

841
00:48:35,045 --> 00:48:37,367
It made me learn a lot, not about just games, but myself.

842
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:43,414
I haven't really heard other people tell stories like this, I guess, and, you know, heard about

843
00:48:43,474 --> 00:48:47,577
other people's journeys as designers and how they learnt things about themselves and what

844
00:48:47,637 --> 00:48:48,978
self-realizations they had.

845
00:48:49,878 --> 00:48:52,140
So I really hope now other people will share theirs.

846
00:48:53,381 --> 00:48:53,581
Thanks.

847
00:49:05,559 --> 00:49:08,781
So we have some time for some questions if people want to come up to the microphones.

848
00:49:09,481 --> 00:49:12,944
Also there will be emailed out the evaluation forms.

849
00:49:12,984 --> 00:49:15,506
If you guys could fill that out and give me feedback, that would be awesome.

850
00:49:15,526 --> 00:49:16,727
That would be fantastic.

851
00:49:17,728 --> 00:49:17,928
Yes?

852
00:49:18,228 --> 00:49:20,090
So, thank you for sharing the story.

853
00:49:20,510 --> 00:49:25,353
It makes me realize we're not alone because we also had to ban a game in the office for very, very similar reasons.

854
00:49:25,514 --> 00:49:26,094
Oh wow, cool.

855
00:49:26,154 --> 00:49:28,996
Although our game was the classic game of diplomacy.

856
00:49:29,357 --> 00:49:29,637
Yes.

857
00:49:30,778 --> 00:49:31,718
Have you tried that in your office?

858
00:49:32,921 --> 00:49:36,525
No, actually we have done it a couple of times in the office. I haven't been involved.

859
00:49:36,825 --> 00:49:40,469
That was, you know, one of the games when I mentioned this one, people say, you know,

860
00:49:40,509 --> 00:49:42,751
it's definitely got that kind of diplomacy vibe.

861
00:49:44,333 --> 00:49:46,275
I think, you know, even though diplomacy...

862
00:49:47,476 --> 00:49:49,338
you know, has definitely has those similar effects.

863
00:49:49,398 --> 00:49:50,919
When the guys in the office have played it,

864
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,962
it's never had that ability where it's kind of

865
00:49:53,062 --> 00:49:55,664
spread virally out into the rest of the office.

866
00:49:56,125 --> 00:49:58,487
So I mean, people have played it and gotten very invested

867
00:49:58,567 --> 00:49:59,848
and you know, had their ups and downs,

868
00:49:59,868 --> 00:50:01,610
but it's kind of remained contained

869
00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:03,912
to a fairly small set of players.

870
00:50:03,952 --> 00:50:05,874
And I think that was one of the differentiators

871
00:50:06,255 --> 00:50:07,796
between the prototype and diplomacy.

872
00:50:07,816 --> 00:50:08,617
Thank you.

873
00:50:08,917 --> 00:50:09,118
Thanks.

874
00:50:10,043 --> 00:50:10,204
Yes?

875
00:50:10,685 --> 00:50:14,494
So you mentioned that adding randomness to a game

876
00:50:14,554 --> 00:50:16,138
can actually give players an outlet

877
00:50:16,178 --> 00:50:18,123
to essentially blame the game mechanics instead

878
00:50:18,163 --> 00:50:19,426
of each other for.

879
00:50:20,595 --> 00:50:22,195
if something didn't necessarily go their way.

880
00:50:23,435 --> 00:50:28,957
Is introducing randomness, like rolling a die to actually hit another tank, one of the things you thought of?

881
00:50:29,517 --> 00:50:34,178
Yeah, that's something that I definitely want to try out. I think for a couple of reasons.

882
00:50:34,598 --> 00:50:38,539
One, for the randomness factor, but it also means that people will have to be...

883
00:50:39,179 --> 00:50:42,620
when they're devising their tactics, they're going to have to build in fail-safes.

884
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:45,841
So, I mean, the very simple idea I had was, you know, we could make it a coin,

885
00:50:45,921 --> 00:50:48,382
make it 50-50 whether a hit lands or not.

886
00:50:48,979 --> 00:50:51,620
That means you can't very clinically build up

887
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,940
six action points and then know that you need to move three,

888
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,901
and then you've got three shots and you'll take them out.

889
00:50:56,941 --> 00:51:01,681
You're gonna need to build in a bit of buffer room there.

890
00:51:02,101 --> 00:51:04,762
And sometimes, even though you build in buffer,

891
00:51:05,502 --> 00:51:07,923
you might get out of it and keep lots of action points

892
00:51:07,963 --> 00:51:11,943
at the end, or you might use all your action points

893
00:51:12,043 --> 00:51:14,404
and not manage to kill them and they have one heart left.

894
00:51:14,424 --> 00:51:15,784
I think it would be really interesting.

895
00:51:16,809 --> 00:51:19,310
I'd be interested to know when we do it whether

896
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:22,772
that takes some of the intensity and the edge off and whether that

897
00:51:23,132 --> 00:51:25,673
makes it less engaging for people, I'm really not sure.

898
00:51:25,693 --> 00:51:30,515
It's something I'm certainly looking to try and be really interested to see the results.

899
00:51:31,495 --> 00:51:35,477
Yeah, I feel like, well I kind of wonder if

900
00:51:36,197 --> 00:51:38,918
the game would benefit from a negative feedback loop, like maybe instead of

901
00:51:39,519 --> 00:51:42,300
giving action points, the judges could actually take away action points.

902
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:43,460
Yeah.

903
00:51:45,578 --> 00:51:47,939
given that you kind of mentioned that the game was sort of poisonous,

904
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,221
did anyone in the office ask you to bring it back?

905
00:51:54,703 --> 00:51:55,684
Interesting question.

906
00:51:56,484 --> 00:52:00,586
So, when I decided I wanted to investigate more about the game,

907
00:52:01,547 --> 00:52:03,868
I sent out an email and I said,

908
00:52:03,888 --> 00:52:07,450
okay, anyone who played the game, anyone who played the prototype,

909
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:08,811
you know the one I'm talking about,

910
00:52:09,812 --> 00:52:13,454
let me know because I want to talk to you and I want to find out more about your experience.

911
00:52:14,650 --> 00:52:20,075
And about five minutes later I had an email from almost every single person who was involved in the game.

912
00:52:20,155 --> 00:52:23,919
And I think about 70% of them said something along the lines of, you know,

913
00:52:23,999 --> 00:52:26,361
I'm curled up in the fetal position right now.

914
00:52:26,381 --> 00:52:28,443
I don't want to have anything to do with it.

915
00:52:28,984 --> 00:52:31,866
30% of the players said, oh my god, yes, let's do it again, let's play.

916
00:52:33,894 --> 00:52:35,455
Interestingly, the people who were saying,

917
00:52:35,836 --> 00:52:38,478
yes, let's do it, let's play, were the kind of,

918
00:52:38,858 --> 00:52:40,480
the mastermind players, you know.

919
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:42,822
They were definitely those kingmaker players,

920
00:52:42,942 --> 00:52:45,324
and then the players, for want of a better word,

921
00:52:45,364 --> 00:52:47,866
that were very much pawns in someone else's game.

922
00:52:50,008 --> 00:52:52,510
But everyone agreed that there was something,

923
00:52:52,530 --> 00:52:53,571
there's something there.

924
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:55,392
There has to be something for it to evoke

925
00:52:55,453 --> 00:52:58,215
such powerful emotions, and that we should...

926
00:52:59,153 --> 00:53:02,614
We should keep on exploring that and see what else there is to learn.

927
00:53:02,994 --> 00:53:06,095
Did the game ever resolve itself? Did you actually have a winner at the end?

928
00:53:06,395 --> 00:53:06,975
Or you never got that far?

929
00:53:07,575 --> 00:53:09,636
It kind of did and kind of didn't.

930
00:53:09,756 --> 00:53:11,137
I mean, you know, we pretty much said,

931
00:53:11,157 --> 00:53:12,837
okay, look, we've got to shut it down.

932
00:53:13,017 --> 00:53:16,338
And the players kind of mutually agreed to what the

933
00:53:16,678 --> 00:53:18,399
first, second, third, fourth place was.

934
00:53:19,339 --> 00:53:21,460
I mean, it kind of concluded, but not

935
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,720
in a natural sort of way. It was kind of

936
00:53:24,101 --> 00:53:26,041
stunted by the fact that we said we were cutting it off.

937
00:53:26,681 --> 00:53:27,101
Cool, thanks.

938
00:53:29,893 --> 00:53:33,040
Did people feel worse or better when they were in the jury?

939
00:53:34,796 --> 00:53:38,419
So that was interesting as well. A lot of players were,

940
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:45,045
once they were in the jury and it didn't seem like they were so actively involved in the game, that was one thing, but then

941
00:53:45,646 --> 00:53:51,271
active players, they obviously knew who was in the jury, and these active players would start like hassling

942
00:53:51,832 --> 00:53:57,096
people in the jury to vote for them and it was kind of, in the jury you couldn't really escape.

943
00:53:57,717 --> 00:53:59,579
So in Survivor, for example.

944
00:54:00,662 --> 00:54:03,665
all of people who are out and they're in the jury, they leave the island, right?

945
00:54:03,685 --> 00:54:06,767
And then they come back once a week to vote, and that's sort of it.

946
00:54:07,007 --> 00:54:08,668
Well, actually, it's right at the end, isn't it?

947
00:54:09,209 --> 00:54:11,411
They come back in, so they kind of get separated from it.

948
00:54:11,871 --> 00:54:14,593
In this jury, the players were still always there,

949
00:54:14,993 --> 00:54:18,336
and they kind of get hassled, and that caused a lot of negative feelings as well.

950
00:54:19,597 --> 00:54:22,860
And then the other thing I was going to suggest was, um, if you...

951
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:26,861
an idea might be if you give an action point,

952
00:54:27,221 --> 00:54:29,382
that you're immune to that person's shots

953
00:54:29,462 --> 00:54:30,902
for a couple of turns or something.

954
00:54:31,102 --> 00:54:33,523
And that way, it makes the daisy chains,

955
00:54:33,963 --> 00:54:37,484
if you give that guy nine AP, he can't kill anybody

956
00:54:37,564 --> 00:54:39,585
because everybody's immune to his shots for the next.

957
00:54:41,025 --> 00:54:46,206
And so it might cause some of that crazy daisy chain to,

958
00:54:46,667 --> 00:54:47,987
they'd have to take that into account.

959
00:54:48,207 --> 00:54:49,407
Yeah, definitely.

960
00:54:49,447 --> 00:54:51,388
The gift meant something more than just.

961
00:54:52,676 --> 00:54:54,261
in a way to aggregate power.

962
00:54:54,442 --> 00:54:56,469
Yeah, that's a great suggestion.

963
00:54:56,489 --> 00:54:56,790
Thanks.

964
00:54:58,172 --> 00:55:06,276
Hi, so I was in digital games for about 11 years and I've gone into teaching and I agree that preparing talks on a subject,

965
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:09,577
it really makes you think so hard about what you're doing.

966
00:55:09,637 --> 00:55:12,699
So it's lovely to see people still in the industry doing that as well.

967
00:55:12,919 --> 00:55:13,179
Thank you.

968
00:55:13,219 --> 00:55:17,901
One of the things I teach is paper prototyping, so it's lovely to see you guys doing that.

969
00:55:18,541 --> 00:55:24,644
Do you think, though, that the physicality of the tokens made them worth more?

970
00:55:25,510 --> 00:55:26,632
Like the 80 points.

971
00:55:26,852 --> 00:55:29,236
I definitely think that it could've, yes.

972
00:55:29,557 --> 00:55:29,857
Because...

973
00:55:31,701 --> 00:55:35,684
I mean, there's something powerful there where you're physically handing it to someone.

974
00:55:35,744 --> 00:55:41,850
That's a lot different to passing it off in a system or just like sending a message.

975
00:55:42,550 --> 00:55:46,153
We actually started building a digital version of this, because I was very interested to

976
00:55:46,193 --> 00:55:50,817
see if just taking the exact same rules and then making it digital, what effect that would have.

977
00:55:51,578 --> 00:55:55,321
Unfortunately, we didn't manage to get around to doing it before this talk.

978
00:55:55,921 --> 00:55:58,823
There's a psychological principle called reciprocity.

979
00:55:59,264 --> 00:56:02,266
Basically when you've given something to somebody, they feel very indebted to you,

980
00:56:02,726 --> 00:56:06,509
which would obviously amplify the betrayal if that person turns on you.

981
00:56:06,569 --> 00:56:12,474
That's right. Neptune's pride was an interesting one because I gave one of my friends

982
00:56:12,634 --> 00:56:18,638
all of my technology and a lot of my money, and he certainly didn't feel indebted to me after that, that's for sure.

983
00:56:20,459 --> 00:56:20,760
Thank you.

984
00:56:23,664 --> 00:56:25,245
So I'm curious about the backstabbing.

985
00:56:26,705 --> 00:56:28,886
Ostensibly, a cursory analysis, you've

986
00:56:28,906 --> 00:56:31,047
got the jury mechanic, which should hypothetically

987
00:56:31,708 --> 00:56:33,588
discourage the backstabbing.

988
00:56:34,149 --> 00:56:35,209
And yet, it completely didn't.

989
00:56:35,269 --> 00:56:37,170
And I'm wondering if you have any insights

990
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:38,450
into why that happened.

991
00:56:38,490 --> 00:56:41,232
Is it because there was so much propaganda and politics

992
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:42,792
within the office environment that did it?

993
00:56:43,272 --> 00:56:44,693
Or was there something else mechanically

994
00:56:45,073 --> 00:56:48,355
that wasn't working to disincentivize that backstabbing?

995
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:54,617
I guess, you know, at a simple level, you needed three jurors to aggregate one extra

996
00:56:54,697 --> 00:56:55,298
action point.

997
00:56:55,458 --> 00:57:00,925
If you took out enough of the other players and, you know, had a strong enough force yourself,

998
00:57:01,706 --> 00:57:05,530
all of the players that you're allied with are generating one action point per day.

999
00:57:06,013 --> 00:57:10,335
Whereas in the jury, technically they're generating one-third of an action point per day.

1000
00:57:10,375 --> 00:57:13,017
So I think that kind of imbalance there was a large part of it.

1001
00:57:13,797 --> 00:57:16,159
I think it'd be really interesting if they could just straight up give

1002
00:57:16,179 --> 00:57:20,361
a whole action point. Every person in the jury could pass off what action point

1003
00:57:20,381 --> 00:57:22,642
they normally would have gotten onto any player they wish.

1004
00:57:23,563 --> 00:57:27,304
That said, it frightens me what that would do the jury as well.

1005
00:57:27,604 --> 00:57:32,345
The jury was already pretty intense, but that would make it even crazier.

1006
00:57:32,805 --> 00:57:37,446
But yeah, it was interesting. It really didn't curb that kind of backstabbing the way that I thought it would.

1007
00:57:38,466 --> 00:57:43,308
Now, it was just like any three jurors could give that one action point.

1008
00:57:43,328 --> 00:57:48,229
So I guess in that case, you didn't have to have all friends on the jury.

1009
00:57:48,249 --> 00:57:51,310
You just had to have three friends on the jury, and you could alienate everyone else.

1010
00:57:52,373 --> 00:57:59,857
Well, yes, that's true. Although, I'm not sure if I mentioned it, but the way that works is it actually stacks as well.

1011
00:57:59,937 --> 00:58:04,319
So if nine people vote for you, you get three action points from that.

1012
00:58:04,759 --> 00:58:07,801
So, you know, it was interesting that way. And a lot of people...

1013
00:58:08,441 --> 00:58:12,503
There was a little bit of a thing going around where multiple people were in one alliance

1014
00:58:12,543 --> 00:58:15,404
and what they did was they pretended they were all on different factions

1015
00:58:15,464 --> 00:58:17,826
and then they'd target three different jurors each.

1016
00:58:18,466 --> 00:58:24,008
So then effectively that kind of faction would capture the majority of the action points from the jury.

1017
00:58:24,229 --> 00:58:26,550
It's crazy, these guys.

1018
00:58:26,830 --> 00:58:31,852
It turns out people who are like game developers think really deeply about games they're playing.

1019
00:58:33,653 --> 00:58:35,574
And I think we have time for one more question.

1020
00:58:36,757 --> 00:58:53,524
And so, your talk about this kind of game reminds me a lot of years ago, I had a tip-top game club at my college and we were playing this one board game, I don't know how many people are familiar with it, the Battlestar Galactica board game, which...

1021
00:58:54,161 --> 00:59:00,306
Actually, I definitely recommend it to everybody because it really captures that feeling of the

1022
00:59:00,346 --> 00:59:06,371
show. What was really interesting, what you're talking about reminding me of, is that one of the

1023
00:59:06,431 --> 00:59:16,299
main dramatic mechanics there is that every player is dealt a loyalty card in secret. One person is

1024
00:59:16,419 --> 00:59:22,084
the Cylon, who is secretly trying to screw everyone over, but the mechanics are such that you don't

1025
00:59:22,685 --> 00:59:24,387
necessarily know exactly who that is.

1026
00:59:24,488 --> 00:59:28,274
So it creates this interesting scenario where everyone's paranoid of each other,

1027
00:59:28,774 --> 00:59:31,619
yet the overall game itself is cooperative.

1028
00:59:31,639 --> 00:59:33,923
People aren't necessarily...

1029
00:59:34,810 --> 00:59:42,316
Basically, it's like it's it's like a team of people against the one saboteur who's trying who's basically

1030
00:59:42,737 --> 00:59:44,018
I guess helping the board win

1031
00:59:44,218 --> 00:59:44,818
Yeah

1032
00:59:44,879 --> 00:59:51,084
If you will so so that that might be actually a good a good board game to look at in you know sort of figuring

1033
00:59:51,204 --> 00:59:53,986
Out you know how to leverage those really strong dramatic

1034
00:59:54,598 --> 01:00:00,481
mechanics yet to reign it in. I think really that sort of cooperative aspect with the saboteur

1035
01:00:00,561 --> 01:00:08,545
I think really helps because then players, it gives more, it puts the focus more on teamwork

1036
01:00:09,345 --> 01:00:12,627
and sort of mitigates some of those toxic factors you were talking about.

1037
01:00:12,647 --> 01:00:16,328
That's awesome, that's a great suggestion. Thanks very much. Thanks everyone.
