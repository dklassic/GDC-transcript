1
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:11,413
Oh, the joys of a Friday afternoon talk. My voice is

2
00:00:11,413 --> 00:00:14,836
shot already, and you all should be on your way

3
00:00:14,836 --> 00:00:17,558
to catch an airplane, and we're all a little

4
00:00:17,558 --> 00:00:21,861
bit hungover. So let's get started, and then they

5
00:00:21,861 --> 00:00:23,602
can tear this place down.

6
00:00:23,602 --> 00:00:29,266
So my name is Jamie Griesemer. I've been a

7
00:00:29,266 --> 00:00:32,848
game designer for about fifteen years. I originally started

8
00:00:32,848 --> 00:00:35,110
at Bungie, which was acquired by Microsoft.

9
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:41,392
left Bungie, went to Sucker Punch, that was almost immediately acquired by Sony. So I'm

10
00:00:41,392 --> 00:00:48,295
a good luck charm if you're looking to be bought by a large console maker. I worked

11
00:00:48,295 --> 00:00:51,496
on a bunch of games, all of which involve colons.

12
00:00:53,059 --> 00:00:58,323
and uh... might my talks are very fast it's early drinking from fire hose

13
00:00:58,323 --> 00:00:58,884
so if uh...

14
00:00:58,884 --> 00:01:02,486
i'm making a point that is irrelevant to your game just wait ten seconds and i'll

15
00:01:02,486 --> 00:01:03,808
get on to the next one

16
00:01:03,808 --> 00:01:07,210
uh... hopefully uh... a couple of them will will matter to you

17
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:12,376
So two years ago, I did a talk that was inspired by this painting.

18
00:01:12,376 --> 00:01:15,776
It's Sunday afternoon on the island of La Grande Jatte.

19
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:20,157
And it's an example of pointillism, which means it has tons of tiny little dots that

20
00:01:20,157 --> 00:01:24,518
make up an enormous, like 30-foot tall painting.

21
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:32,360
And the idea was that I would examine one tiny little detail about the Halo games and

22
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:38,851
spend an hour talking about it and get really, really into all the way into that one decision.

23
00:01:38,851 --> 00:01:43,972
So I picked the sniper rifle reload. And then over the course of developing the talk, it

24
00:01:43,972 --> 00:01:52,015
really became about balance and how a game designer can balance a game so that once it's

25
00:01:52,015 --> 00:01:57,237
out in the wild, they don't have to touch it anymore and it can just continue to have

26
00:01:57,237 --> 00:02:00,218
a life of its own and the community can continue to play it.

27
00:02:01,602 --> 00:02:08,788
So then the next year they asked me to do another talk in this series, so I looked for another painting to inspire me,

28
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:11,070
and I picked Haystacks by Monet.

29
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:16,114
And what he did was he took the same exact haystacks and he painted them at different times of year and different times of day.

30
00:02:16,114 --> 00:02:24,180
And so that gave me the idea of like, let's take one detail and look at it in multiple games in the Halo franchise and see how it changed.

31
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,924
So I looked at the moza velocity of the plasma rifle bolt.

32
00:02:30,947 --> 00:02:37,391
and tracked it across the first three games of the Halo franchise, but really that talk was about tuning and how

33
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:44,857
you can change small aspects of the game to create a certain experience, and then if you change that

34
00:02:44,857 --> 00:02:47,959
to be something else, it changes the experience that it generates.

35
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:55,514
So in my continuing effort to wage war on the formatting of

36
00:02:55,514 --> 00:03:03,038
the GDC website by having increasingly longer titles,

37
00:03:03,038 --> 00:03:05,019
when they asked me to talk this year, I said, that's

38
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:06,860
great, but I don't want to talk about Halo.

39
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:10,941
You guys are sick of hearing about Halo, I'm sick of talking about Halo.

40
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:14,303
So I had to come up with something else to talk about this year.

41
00:03:14,303 --> 00:03:18,585
And again I turned to art for inspiration. This is actually

42
00:03:18,585 --> 00:03:22,467
my favorite painting. It's the Annunciation by El Greco.

43
00:03:24,418 --> 00:03:28,423
It's actually really, really tall, so if you're standing in front of it, it looks more like

44
00:03:28,423 --> 00:03:29,264
this.

45
00:03:29,264 --> 00:03:35,572
And it's about the angel Gabriel coming to Mary and telling her that she's going to conceive

46
00:03:35,572 --> 00:03:39,918
a son and that his name's going to be Jesus, and you guys maybe know that story.

47
00:03:41,357 --> 00:03:47,502
And what's really interesting about this painting is the faces and the detail and the colors.

48
00:03:47,502 --> 00:03:51,465
But what's more interesting about this painting is it's not the first painting called the

49
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:52,446
Annunciation.

50
00:03:52,446 --> 00:03:56,669
There's actually dozens and dozens and dozens of paintings from hundreds and hundreds and

51
00:03:56,669 --> 00:04:01,814
hundreds of years, all of them painting this one exact moment and capturing it in their

52
00:04:01,814 --> 00:04:02,334
own style.

53
00:04:02,334 --> 00:04:08,159
So that gave me the idea to look at different games that addressed the same problem, maybe

54
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,220
had the same details.

55
00:04:10,192 --> 00:04:10,734
and compare them.

56
00:04:10,734 --> 00:04:13,425
So this year, we're not talking about my games,

57
00:04:13,425 --> 00:04:14,670
we're talking about your games.

58
00:04:17,804 --> 00:04:23,207
I'm sort of infamous for a blog post that I wrote where I gave Uncharted 2 a 7.5 and

59
00:04:23,207 --> 00:04:27,370
then I gave Jumper, a game that none of you have played, also a 7.5.

60
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:33,253
And really the point is that as a game designer you should be playing really good games and

61
00:04:33,253 --> 00:04:36,775
looking for the flaws and looking for the problems.

62
00:04:36,775 --> 00:04:41,698
And you should also be playing not so good games and trying to draw the promise and train

63
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:45,380
yourself to find the gem in the rough.

64
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,958
So that means if I'm criticizing a game,

65
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,440
that means I think it's a good game.

66
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,924
So I hope I'm not burning too many bridges in this talk

67
00:04:57,924 --> 00:04:59,825
by criticizing a bunch of games from a bunch

68
00:04:59,825 --> 00:05:02,587
of very talented developers and designers.

69
00:05:02,587 --> 00:05:04,829
Keep in mind that I'm speculating.

70
00:05:04,829 --> 00:05:06,650
I didn't work on these games.

71
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:09,152
That actually made it a lot harder

72
00:05:09,152 --> 00:05:10,793
to draw out some of the details.

73
00:05:11,284 --> 00:05:14,587
So I'm doing a lot of guessing, and if I guess wrong about your

74
00:05:14,587 --> 00:05:16,009
game, don't be insulted.

75
00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:18,351
If I guess right about your game, just don't tell anybody.

76
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:18,812
They won't know.

77
00:05:18,812 --> 00:05:27,982
So welcome, again, to the actual talk, which was so long

78
00:05:27,982 --> 00:05:29,804
they couldn't even fit it on the placard outside.

79
00:05:32,388 --> 00:05:36,471
But before we get started, let me talk a little bit about details and why I think they're

80
00:05:36,471 --> 00:05:37,733
so important.

81
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:42,797
If you change just 5% of your DNA, you go from being a human to being a chimpanzee.

82
00:05:42,797 --> 00:05:48,182
If you're leaving England for the new world and you get a couple degrees off course, you

83
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:51,345
end up in Massachusetts and not where you wanted to be in Virginia.

84
00:05:51,345 --> 00:05:57,050
So small details, especially early on, can have an impact down the road.

85
00:05:57,984 --> 00:06:02,686
We live, we work, sorry, in a fairly mature industry now.

86
00:06:02,686 --> 00:06:05,268
There's lots and lots of professionals out there

87
00:06:05,268 --> 00:06:06,208
on great teams.

88
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:09,150
They're working in established genres.

89
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,591
What that means is that a lot of times,

90
00:06:11,591 --> 00:06:14,312
a really good game and a not so good game

91
00:06:14,312 --> 00:06:15,653
have a lot in common.

92
00:06:15,653 --> 00:06:17,494
There's very little difference

93
00:06:17,494 --> 00:06:19,475
between Halo and Haze, for instance.

94
00:06:21,747 --> 00:06:25,889
But there is not quite as similar an outcome

95
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:30,071
when it comes to Metacritic scores or profit.

96
00:06:30,071 --> 00:06:32,892
And details are the things that make

97
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:37,394
the difference between success and not so much success.

98
00:06:37,394 --> 00:06:39,275
It's important to get the details right.

99
00:06:40,985 --> 00:06:45,029
Another example of how details are powerful is Angry Birds.

100
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:47,691
So Rovio made like 50 games before they got to Angry Birds.

101
00:06:47,691 --> 00:06:49,734
And that allowed them to really nail

102
00:06:49,734 --> 00:06:54,138
the details of working on the iOS platform.

103
00:06:54,138 --> 00:06:57,361
It's got great controls for a touch screen.

104
00:06:57,361 --> 00:07:00,424
The time investment is quick enough that you can.

105
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,614
finish a level in the bathroom.

106
00:07:03,614 --> 00:07:07,336
The reward system is super gratifying.

107
00:07:07,336 --> 00:07:09,917
And they actually even arrived on the scene

108
00:07:09,917 --> 00:07:11,198
just with this perfect timing.

109
00:07:11,198 --> 00:07:12,738
And they're definitely reaping the rewards.

110
00:07:14,347 --> 00:07:18,910
On the other hand, a game that just recently came out, Uncharted 3, but again, Naughty

111
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:23,093
Dog is like the peak of the industry, right?

112
00:07:23,093 --> 00:07:29,077
But they missed a couple little minor details like the cam controls.

113
00:07:29,077 --> 00:07:33,720
I feel like the animation cycles got a little bit longer, so you feel like you're a little

114
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,061
bit less in control.

115
00:07:35,061 --> 00:07:39,564
Sometimes the jumps can actually take you farther in Uncharted 3, so it's a little bit

116
00:07:39,564 --> 00:07:40,705
harder to...

117
00:07:41,025 --> 00:07:44,207
wind your way through the environment.

118
00:07:44,207 --> 00:07:47,329
And so they really suffered the con- no, no, sorry.

119
00:07:47,329 --> 00:07:48,710
They reaped the rewards too.

120
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:49,470
Never mind.

121
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:52,752
They got every other detail right.

122
00:07:52,752 --> 00:07:53,473
They're fine.

123
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:57,335
The difficulty comes in the fact that details are so subtle.

124
00:07:57,335 --> 00:08:00,417
So who here thinks Limbo had fantastic art direction?

125
00:08:00,417 --> 00:08:00,497
OK.

126
00:08:00,497 --> 00:08:03,659
I'm going to argue you're wrong.

127
00:08:03,659 --> 00:08:06,441
What they had was great design direction.

128
00:08:08,084 --> 00:08:09,765
The fact that everything is in profile

129
00:08:09,765 --> 00:08:10,925
is what makes the game work at all.

130
00:08:10,925 --> 00:08:13,766
I mean, is that a bear trap, or is that some grass?

131
00:08:13,766 --> 00:08:15,327
If you could see it, and it was just rendered,

132
00:08:15,327 --> 00:08:16,787
it wouldn't be much of a puzzle.

133
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,608
Is that a spider coming over to get me,

134
00:08:18,608 --> 00:08:23,309
or is that just some branches in the background?

135
00:08:23,309 --> 00:08:26,891
Without the uncertainty caused by this detail

136
00:08:26,891 --> 00:08:28,331
of the rendering, the game wouldn't even be possible.

137
00:08:28,331 --> 00:08:32,213
And the best part about details is they tend to be portable.

138
00:08:32,213 --> 00:08:34,353
So Darksiders is this.

139
00:08:35,338 --> 00:08:41,302
well-known for liberally porting details maybe to their engines,

140
00:08:41,302 --> 00:08:45,825
so like the hookshot or the boomerang or the portal gun.

141
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:49,308
But because they did such a great job of capturing only

142
00:08:49,308 --> 00:08:51,329
the important details and changing everything else,

143
00:08:51,329 --> 00:08:53,911
instead of feeling like copycat design,

144
00:08:53,911 --> 00:08:57,354
it really feels like a greatest hits game,

145
00:08:57,354 --> 00:08:59,755
where you get to go through all the best game design

146
00:08:59,755 --> 00:09:00,716
details of the last decade.

147
00:09:00,716 --> 00:09:01,457
On the other hand...

148
00:09:08,362 --> 00:09:12,803
If you don't know which details are important, you end up copying too many details and your

149
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:18,886
game is going to end up feeling like a Xerox machine that got left on. You'll get kind

150
00:09:18,886 --> 00:09:28,229
of pale imitations. And if you really don't have any idea what you're doing, you have

151
00:09:28,229 --> 00:09:33,812
to copy every single detail and you get caught. And that's a bridge that I'm happy to burn.

152
00:09:33,812 --> 00:09:36,353
So, uh...

153
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:42,806
The most important thing about details when it comes to being a designer is that they're manageable.

154
00:09:42,806 --> 00:09:46,673
There are thousands and thousands of decisions that go into making a game,

155
00:09:46,673 --> 00:09:49,798
and there's no way that a game designer can keep a handle on all of them.

156
00:09:50,595 --> 00:09:55,380
So if you remember Ratatouille, the little chef, the rat,

157
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,221
couldn't cook in an oversized kitchen, right?

158
00:09:57,221 --> 00:10:01,725
But he could grab his friend's hair

159
00:10:01,725 --> 00:10:05,448
and use that to control him and ended up making great dishes.

160
00:10:05,448 --> 00:10:09,152
So in this metaphor, designers are rats.

161
00:10:09,152 --> 00:10:10,433
Usually the players are the rats.

162
00:10:10,433 --> 00:10:12,655
But in this metaphor, the designer is the rat

163
00:10:12,655 --> 00:10:15,357
and the game is the larger context.

164
00:10:15,357 --> 00:10:18,000
And the hair is the details, I suppose.

165
00:10:19,465 --> 00:10:22,149
So that leads me to the real kind of theme of this talk,

166
00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:25,694
which is that before you can balance and before you can tune

167
00:10:25,694 --> 00:10:27,817
the details that will make your game successful,

168
00:10:27,817 --> 00:10:28,778
you have to identify them.

169
00:10:31,353 --> 00:10:34,775
And so what I've done is gone through my design process

170
00:10:34,775 --> 00:10:37,458
and tried to hook up the details that I

171
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:40,060
found in playing all these games to different aspects

172
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,902
to try to give us a little bit of structure.

173
00:10:42,902 --> 00:10:45,904
Eric Zimmerman did a talk yesterday

174
00:10:45,904 --> 00:10:48,326
where he said we shouldn't instrumentalize our game

175
00:10:48,326 --> 00:10:48,786
design.

176
00:10:48,786 --> 00:10:50,948
And so I want to make this clear.

177
00:10:50,948 --> 00:10:52,049
This is my design process.

178
00:10:52,049 --> 00:10:54,090
I'm not saying this has to be everybody's process.

179
00:10:55,906 --> 00:11:00,929
The first step is to get a concept, and concepts are, by definition, undetailed.

180
00:11:00,929 --> 00:11:06,853
Right? They're notions. They're this, like, here's kind of what I want the player to experience.

181
00:11:06,853 --> 00:11:11,796
But it's always vague at the beginning, so I'm not going to go into any details about concept details.

182
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:16,119
So the first area that we're going to explore is constraints.

183
00:11:16,119 --> 00:11:21,302
If you're familiar with, like, the MDA concept of design...

184
00:11:22,151 --> 00:11:24,674
they would call this mechanics, but for me, instead of

185
00:11:24,674 --> 00:11:28,799
thinking of it as something that you're building and then when it's broken you have to fix it,

186
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:33,505
I like to think of it as constraining the player and then when something's broken I just constrain them a little bit further.

187
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:44,681
So one way that you can constrain the players by removing options. God of War is a very

188
00:11:44,681 --> 00:11:51,762
successful game that got there by removing all camera control, which was sort of new

189
00:11:51,762 --> 00:11:56,863
for the third-person action game. Which is great, because the game is all about stabbing

190
00:11:56,863 --> 00:12:00,704
guys and cutting off their heads and doing horrible things to them. And so not having

191
00:12:00,704 --> 00:12:05,225
to worry about the camera actually freed you up to do what was good about the game.

192
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:08,265
On the other hand, Ocarina of Time, yeah, we're going to go there.

193
00:12:09,847 --> 00:12:11,108
uh...

194
00:12:11,108 --> 00:12:15,593
uh... automated the jumping process and for a game that's about exploration

195
00:12:15,593 --> 00:12:16,875
and jumping is like the one

196
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:19,898
uh... sort of vector of exploration that you have

197
00:12:19,898 --> 00:12:22,742
not being able to jump meant you couldn't explore as much as you want and

198
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,183
could be frustrating

199
00:12:27,719 --> 00:12:30,381
Another way to think about constraints is as a cornerstone.

200
00:12:30,381 --> 00:12:33,925
When you start a building, you lay the first stone,

201
00:12:33,925 --> 00:12:36,547
and that kind of determines the rest of the building,

202
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,769
whether it's going to be square.

203
00:12:38,769 --> 00:12:41,832
So in Halo, our cornerstone, at least for combat,

204
00:12:41,832 --> 00:12:43,274
was the engagement distance.

205
00:12:43,274 --> 00:12:45,916
So we decided how far away we wanted the enemies to be,

206
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:48,418
and that meant we had to have a pretty slow moving speed,

207
00:12:48,418 --> 00:12:50,040
because we didn't want you to be able to run and get there

208
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,781
right away.

209
00:12:50,781 --> 00:12:52,222
We had to have a pretty narrow.

210
00:12:52,743 --> 00:12:56,486
field of view because we wanted enemies to be large at that engagement distance.

211
00:12:56,486 --> 00:13:02,150
That determined how accurate our weapons could be, that determined how many enemies we needed

212
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,431
to have you fight at one time.

213
00:13:03,431 --> 00:13:07,254
It even determined the AI firing parameters because once the AI starts firing at you,

214
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:11,597
you stop and you start firing back, and that is where the engagement distance comes from.

215
00:13:11,597 --> 00:13:16,481
So in Halo, the engagement distance really determined the environment scale.

216
00:13:16,481 --> 00:13:19,003
But if you look at a game like Red Dead, um,

217
00:13:19,816 --> 00:13:24,937
they were clearly trying to create a vast, huge environment, right? So, uh, their movement

218
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:28,898
speed had to be relatively fast because you had to cross very big spaces. And their field of

219
00:13:28,898 --> 00:13:32,339
view had to be very broad because they wanted you to be able to see as much of the environment

220
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:36,840
as possible. And that meant their weapons had to be really accurate and that their, uh, their

221
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:41,962
enemies were spread over a very large space. And it also meant that the AI had to fire, um,

222
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,661
pretty repeatedly because that was one of the only ways that

223
00:13:45,661 --> 00:13:49,184
you could find them, uh, by the giant flash from their gun. And,

224
00:13:49,184 --> 00:13:53,227
uh, so they achieved the environment scale, but because

225
00:13:53,227 --> 00:13:56,370
they determined that detail first, then their engagement

226
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:00,853
range, um, you know, in my opinion, suffered, but, uh, uh,

227
00:14:00,853 --> 00:14:04,095
this isn't intended to be a, a criticism of, of, of their

228
00:14:04,095 --> 00:14:08,078
priority. Just explain how, know your priority and then, and then

229
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:09,740
know that that's going to affect the final game.

230
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:15,612
One way to think about this is solving for gameplay.

231
00:14:15,612 --> 00:14:19,373
So computer role-playing games have this advantage

232
00:14:19,373 --> 00:14:20,473
where they're using computers.

233
00:14:20,473 --> 00:14:22,294
They can do really, really big numbers.

234
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:25,615
And so they tend to equate having a higher level

235
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:26,835
with doing more damage.

236
00:14:26,835 --> 00:14:29,996
And the problem is that this leads to this exponential curve

237
00:14:29,996 --> 00:14:32,257
where if you're doubling the damage every time you go

238
00:14:32,257 --> 00:14:35,958
up a level, at some point you're going to, just a few levels

239
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,159
after you go through content, going back through it's

240
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:39,460
going to be completely trivial.

241
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:43,649
On the other hand, Dungeons & Dragons is dealing with dice and they're dealing with pen and

242
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:45,730
paper, so they can't use huge numbers.

243
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:49,573
So they developed this system called THAC0, which means to hit armor class 0.

244
00:14:49,573 --> 00:14:54,136
And basically what it comes down to, if you're not familiar with Dungeons & Dragons, is you

245
00:14:54,136 --> 00:14:57,158
can only hit enemies that are within a couple levels of you.

246
00:14:57,158 --> 00:15:01,041
So that means that their damage is actually a much flatter curve, and when you go back

247
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:08,306
to lower level content, it still can be engaging because in large numbers, even low level monsters

248
00:15:08,306 --> 00:15:09,447
can be a threat to you.

249
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,625
Another way of looking at this is sort of as a giant equation that you're balancing.

250
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:26,833
So if you're doing a combat game, maybe your programmers are going to give you the kind

251
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:29,555
of obvious parameters of like damage per shot.

252
00:15:29,555 --> 00:15:33,519
And then you're going to say, okay, well, the damage per shot times the shots per second

253
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:34,340
is the damage per second.

254
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:37,322
And then you're going to take the enemy health, you're going to divide it by the damage per

255
00:15:37,322 --> 00:15:39,544
second, and that's going to give you the time to kill.

256
00:15:40,684 --> 00:15:44,645
But really, the player doesn't know about any of those kind of hidden parameters, they

257
00:15:44,645 --> 00:15:45,526
know about time to kill.

258
00:15:45,526 --> 00:15:51,368
So you should be thinking about it as, I want this enemy to take this certain amount of

259
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:56,069
time to kill, and that means if I want to have a gun that has this many shots per second,

260
00:15:56,069 --> 00:15:59,931
and that's usually determined by either the feel or the cadence or the...

261
00:16:01,221 --> 00:16:06,266
fiction, then I'm just going to multiply it time this sort of

262
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:07,907
unusual parameter of shots to kill.

263
00:16:07,907 --> 00:16:10,690
And the shots to kill can be derived in any way that you

264
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:13,473
want, but the important part is that you're setting the non-

265
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,735
abstract values that the player is going to really directly

266
00:16:15,735 --> 00:16:18,457
experience first, and then deriving the rest, rather than

267
00:16:18,457 --> 00:16:19,198
the other way around.

268
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:19,859
A lot of times, um...

269
00:16:26,702 --> 00:16:31,805
Games are in crunch at the end, designers are making decisions really fast, and sort

270
00:16:31,805 --> 00:16:34,306
of making compromises based on the tech.

271
00:16:34,306 --> 00:16:40,790
And so what will happen sometimes is you'll have a genre with a really strong constraint

272
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:45,073
that every game follows, but there's really no reason for it to follow.

273
00:16:46,761 --> 00:16:50,943
innovations of Starcraft was it took what everybody had done before which was

274
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:54,464
symmetrical factions. I mean Warcraft it said it was orcs versus humans but

275
00:16:54,464 --> 00:16:59,387
really it's like orcs versus pink orcs and it blew that up and it came

276
00:16:59,387 --> 00:17:04,409
up with these asymmetrical factions which you know were much more difficult

277
00:17:04,409 --> 00:17:07,830
to balance but it also means that going forward you can play the game for a lot

278
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:12,052
longer because it's not going to kind of settle into a static state.

279
00:17:12,788 --> 00:17:21,231
Myth is another example where resource management was just bound up in the RTS genre until we

280
00:17:21,231 --> 00:17:24,752
realized that we don't have to have that part.

281
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:29,494
Instead of dividing your attention between combat and economy, what if we just had the

282
00:17:29,494 --> 00:17:32,795
cool combat part throughout the economy?

283
00:17:32,795 --> 00:17:37,336
That led to a game that had a lot more immediacy and felt a lot more...

284
00:17:39,589 --> 00:17:47,213
uh like a like a battle simulator rather than a than a strategy game.

285
00:17:47,213 --> 00:17:53,417
So a few years ago um I sat down to play Star Control 2 which I didn't play when it came out and um

286
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:58,192
I was looking at the system requirements and it's like it needs a 20 megahertz machine

287
00:17:58,192 --> 00:18:02,894
and you have to have a 2x CD-ROM drive and I'm like oh this is great because I'm going

288
00:18:02,894 --> 00:18:05,075
to blow the doors off of these system requirements and it'll be fine.

289
00:18:05,075 --> 00:18:09,417
So I started it up and I built my ship and I flew out into space and said oh you know

290
00:18:09,417 --> 00:18:14,579
we're about to have combat and I'm like oh great and the combat came up and it was over.

291
00:18:14,579 --> 00:18:17,861
Turns out that there's also a maximum system requirement for this game.

292
00:18:17,861 --> 00:18:21,802
The clock speed was running way too fast so I could never possibly react fast enough to

293
00:18:21,802 --> 00:18:22,383
win anything.

294
00:18:24,106 --> 00:18:27,429
uh... and our brains are sort of similar uh... you know the uh...

295
00:18:27,429 --> 00:18:29,691
they're three pounds of meat

296
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:31,912
they run on very low wattage

297
00:18:31,912 --> 00:18:32,913
their

298
00:18:32,913 --> 00:18:35,275
firmware was written millions of years ago and so

299
00:18:35,275 --> 00:18:39,158
you shouldn't expect too much out of your brain or out of your players brains

300
00:18:39,158 --> 00:18:42,421
and one of the ways that games are interesting is they kind of stretch

301
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:45,324
our capacity, I've heard it's called like attention or focus

302
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:49,387
uh... but in this circumstance I'm going to call it capacity

303
00:18:50,876 --> 00:18:54,120
So to go back to my Star Control example,

304
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,044
like the faster the game was going,

305
00:18:57,044 --> 00:18:59,467
the more it stretched my capacity.

306
00:18:59,467 --> 00:19:02,030
And if it had been going at the original slow speed,

307
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,952
I would've been fine, but because it was blowing out

308
00:19:03,952 --> 00:19:08,738
the processor, I didn't have enough capacity

309
00:19:08,738 --> 00:19:09,659
to actually pull it off.

310
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:13,915
So some other examples of this, in fact the best example

311
00:19:13,915 --> 00:19:14,755
in my opinion is Tetris.

312
00:19:14,755 --> 00:19:18,637
So Tetris starts out, it's actually very simple inputs

313
00:19:18,637 --> 00:19:20,718
that you're doing, it's a very simple mechanic

314
00:19:20,718 --> 00:19:22,499
that you're taking advantage of,

315
00:19:22,499 --> 00:19:23,699
and it starts out very slow, right?

316
00:19:23,699 --> 00:19:26,020
And then it gets pretty quickly up to the point

317
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:29,682
where you're fully engaged and it's kind of filling

318
00:19:29,682 --> 00:19:33,243
your capacity, and then it stays there for quite a long time

319
00:19:33,243 --> 00:19:36,705
till like level 16, at least that's my experience,

320
00:19:36,705 --> 00:19:38,686
when it passes your capacity and it's too fast

321
00:19:38,686 --> 00:19:40,467
and it starts to stack up pretty quickly and you lose.

322
00:19:42,668 --> 00:19:44,810
When Tetris first came out for the iOS,

323
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:47,431
the input is a lot more complicated,

324
00:19:47,431 --> 00:19:49,652
it's a lot more difficult. So what they did

325
00:19:49,652 --> 00:19:51,613
was they slowed down the pieces a lot.

326
00:19:51,613 --> 00:19:54,214
But the end result was that you'd

327
00:19:54,214 --> 00:19:57,576
be bored for a long time because it was super easy.

328
00:19:57,576 --> 00:19:59,197
And then all of a sudden it would just click over,

329
00:19:59,197 --> 00:20:01,198
it would go just a little bit faster,

330
00:20:01,198 --> 00:20:02,639
and you couldn't keep up anymore,

331
00:20:02,639 --> 00:20:03,939
and you'd lose almost immediately.

332
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,821
So they re-released Tetris recently.

333
00:20:06,821 --> 00:20:09,943
And I strongly suggest you pick it up if you love Tetris.

334
00:20:09,943 --> 00:20:13,445
What they did was they removed all the inputs.

335
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:15,266
All you're doing now is you're selecting

336
00:20:15,266 --> 00:20:17,347
from one of the, in this case, five places

337
00:20:17,347 --> 00:20:18,108
where you want it to go.

338
00:20:18,108 --> 00:20:20,089
The answer is five, in case you don't

339
00:20:20,089 --> 00:20:21,470
know how to play Tetris.

340
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:25,132
And by reducing the complexity, they actually

341
00:20:25,132 --> 00:20:26,973
increase the speed at which things can happen.

342
00:20:26,973 --> 00:20:30,215
And this version feels more like the Game Boy Tetris

343
00:20:30,215 --> 00:20:31,776
than the original one that they tried to do.

344
00:20:35,022 --> 00:20:36,103
uh...

345
00:20:36,103 --> 00:20:40,846
which which shows that uh... it's not just speed that is gating your capacity

346
00:20:40,846 --> 00:20:41,507
it's also

347
00:20:41,507 --> 00:20:44,929
complexity right and this isn't just uh... input complexity this is like

348
00:20:44,929 --> 00:20:48,732
complexity of the concepts that you're dealing with or the mechanical complexity

349
00:20:48,732 --> 00:20:50,953
of having to do the inputs on a controller

350
00:20:50,953 --> 00:20:54,436
or even the information complexity like how much is the game throwing at you that you have to process

351
00:20:57,344 --> 00:21:01,387
uh... when i was uh... a kid that there at least two arcade games came out in

352
00:21:01,387 --> 00:21:02,468
nineteen eighty two which meant

353
00:21:02,468 --> 00:21:07,512
by the time i was old enough to play them they were old but that also meant that

354
00:21:07,512 --> 00:21:10,595
uh... nobody was at the machines and i actually got to get up there

355
00:21:10,595 --> 00:21:13,517
uh... first was Xevious

356
00:21:13,517 --> 00:21:17,520
uh... very simple screen layout it's a 2D shoot em up

357
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,023
simple graphics so it was really easy to tell where your ship was really easy to tell

358
00:21:21,023 --> 00:21:22,385
where the enemy bullets were coming from

359
00:21:22,385 --> 00:21:24,566
and so it was fairly fast and it was a lot of fun

360
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:31,505
On the other side of the arcade was Zaxxon, which is isometric, the backgrounds are really

361
00:21:31,505 --> 00:21:36,289
complicated, you're having to deal with heights above the terrain and dodging stuff in the

362
00:21:36,289 --> 00:21:39,613
environment while these bullets are blending into the background.

363
00:21:39,613 --> 00:21:43,136
And so it was equally fast, but because it was so much more complicated, it became very

364
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:45,078
frustrating at least to my ten year old self.

365
00:21:48,194 --> 00:21:51,195
So when you're looking at your game, what you need to be doing is thinking about system

366
00:21:51,195 --> 00:21:57,879
requirements that you're putting on your players. Is your game fast and simple, like Gradius?

367
00:21:57,879 --> 00:22:03,441
Or is it slow and complicated, like Civilization? Or is it somewhere in between? But if you

368
00:22:03,441 --> 00:22:07,263
make a game that's fast and complex, what you're really making is like flying a jet,

369
00:22:07,263 --> 00:22:13,246
which is much too hard for most people. Only a certain number of people in the whole world

370
00:22:13,246 --> 00:22:13,926
can even do it.

371
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,045
And if you go on the other side, you're not making a game in that direction either because

372
00:22:19,045 --> 00:22:23,591
what you're doing is so slow and so simple that there's no engagement at all.

373
00:22:23,591 --> 00:22:28,117
So what you want to do is stay in the, I'm going to call it the game band, where you're

374
00:22:28,117 --> 00:22:30,620
balancing the speed and the complexity of your game.

375
00:22:33,325 --> 00:22:38,648
Max Payne is a great example of this in sort of a flexible situation.

376
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:41,109
Most of the game is fast and the shooting is relatively simple.

377
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:42,169
You're fighting one or two guys.

378
00:22:42,169 --> 00:22:46,911
But sometimes they throw you into a situation where you're fighting a lot of people and

379
00:22:46,911 --> 00:22:52,734
then they give you the ability to slow the game down in order to cope with a much more

380
00:22:52,734 --> 00:22:54,154
complicated situation.

381
00:22:54,154 --> 00:23:01,817
Survive mode, not only in Gears, but I think this applies to virtually every survivor mode.

382
00:23:03,545 --> 00:23:06,127
has a kind of a narrower band that it's allowed to operate in

383
00:23:06,127 --> 00:23:09,849
because the setup is generally pretty simple. These games are

384
00:23:09,849 --> 00:23:13,671
usually action games. They're not about setting up a giant

385
00:23:13,671 --> 00:23:15,712
tower defense system or something. And then when the

386
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:17,713
wave comes in and it's very complicated and you're dealing

387
00:23:17,713 --> 00:23:22,235
with a lot of stuff and it can go bad very quickly. But a

388
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:25,577
smaller game, Orcs Must Die, came out and it actually has a

389
00:23:25,577 --> 00:23:29,179
very complicated setup. You're putting traps, you're funneling

390
00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:31,040
guys through different parts of the level.

391
00:23:32,557 --> 00:23:37,021
And so when the waves come, that part's actually just very simple.

392
00:23:37,021 --> 00:23:38,723
It's just your traps are killing most of the guys,

393
00:23:38,723 --> 00:23:41,526
and you're just spamming as much of your weapon as possible.

394
00:23:48,169 --> 00:23:51,690
System requirements come in different types, right?

395
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:53,291
Like there was the processor speed,

396
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:57,052
and then there was the CD drive speed in the earlier example.

397
00:23:57,052 --> 00:23:59,812
One of the system requirements for games

398
00:23:59,812 --> 00:24:01,653
is continuous interactions.

399
00:24:01,653 --> 00:24:05,274
So almost always, these are things like moving, aiming,

400
00:24:05,274 --> 00:24:06,654
things that you're always doing.

401
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:08,775
They're analog.

402
00:24:08,775 --> 00:24:11,976
And they take up this kind of fast but simple corner

403
00:24:11,976 --> 00:24:12,536
of the graph.

404
00:24:13,796 --> 00:24:15,577
They require high dexterity.

405
00:24:15,577 --> 00:24:19,920
So usually you'll see one or two of these at a time.

406
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,822
If it's on the thumb stick, it's almost inevitably

407
00:24:21,822 --> 00:24:23,182
in this category.

408
00:24:23,182 --> 00:24:25,084
The mouse definitely qualifies.

409
00:24:25,084 --> 00:24:28,126
I'd say the keyboard, because it's not continuous,

410
00:24:28,126 --> 00:24:33,029
maybe doesn't fit in, which is why aiming is better on the PC.

411
00:24:33,029 --> 00:24:35,431
But moving is actually, in my opinion, better on a console.

412
00:24:37,627 --> 00:24:43,453
So Geometry Wars is an excellent example of using up all of somebody's capacity

413
00:24:43,453 --> 00:24:45,375
for these continuous actions.

414
00:24:45,375 --> 00:24:48,478
You're always deflecting both of the thumbsticks

415
00:24:48,478 --> 00:24:53,184
and they have no other, I mean, if you're discounting bombs, there's no other inputs in the game.

416
00:24:53,184 --> 00:24:57,068
So it still stays in that game band, it doesn't get too complicated too fast.

417
00:24:58,528 --> 00:25:02,451
Halo, on the other hand, is actually maybe less accessible

418
00:25:02,451 --> 00:25:05,653
to people, because you're always using both sticks,

419
00:25:05,653 --> 00:25:07,534
but then there's also a lot of other stuff going on.

420
00:25:07,534 --> 00:25:09,975
And so we found that when we first introduced Halo,

421
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:12,197
a lot of people couldn't do two thumbsticks at once.

422
00:25:12,197 --> 00:25:13,477
And only as the series went on did we

423
00:25:13,477 --> 00:25:16,079
see more and more people able to even play the game.

424
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:18,160
Kill Switch, if you don't know, is sort of the,

425
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,541
kicked off the whole cover shooter.

426
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:34,791
uh, a trend that's, that we're still seeing today. And in some ways this was an improvement

427
00:25:34,791 --> 00:25:39,853
over Halo, because, uh, you're either moving between cover, or you're in cover and you're

428
00:25:39,853 --> 00:25:44,654
shooting, but either way you're only using one thumb at a time, and that's why I feel

429
00:25:44,654 --> 00:25:48,895
like cover shooters are much more accessible. So if you're trying to make a game that, um,

430
00:25:48,895 --> 00:25:53,317
goes beyond that kind of hardcore, uh, shooter market, uh,

431
00:25:54,518 --> 00:25:58,562
uh, not only making a cover shooter, but really separating

432
00:25:58,562 --> 00:25:59,823
the two kinds of input I think will help a lot.

433
00:25:59,823 --> 00:26:03,127
Common actions, uh, uh, sort of take this, uh, um, mid, mid, uh,

434
00:26:03,127 --> 00:26:11,775
range of the graph. Um, this is things that you're, you're

435
00:26:11,775 --> 00:26:15,159
doing, but they're usually, um, like simple actions, they're

436
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:18,102
not using analogs, so firing weapons, using a melee attack.

437
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,973
And this requires a lot of attention from your player.

438
00:26:22,973 --> 00:26:25,413
So you shouldn't have more than two or three of these at a time.

439
00:26:25,413 --> 00:26:27,194
I think that's why most games don't fill up the face buttons

440
00:26:27,194 --> 00:26:29,495
with stuff that you're doing all the time, and why a controller

441
00:26:29,495 --> 00:26:31,255
with like 18 buttons on it wouldn't actually

442
00:26:31,255 --> 00:26:31,695
be an improvement.

443
00:26:31,695 --> 00:26:32,995
Because you just couldn't fill them with,

444
00:26:32,995 --> 00:26:34,436
you could fill them with more actions

445
00:26:34,436 --> 00:26:35,256
than your players have capacity.

446
00:26:35,256 --> 00:26:36,416
Infamous, too, sort of took from one of his talks

447
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,817
about these nice-looking keyboard shortcuts,

448
00:26:37,817 --> 00:26:39,837
and how you can use that keyboard shortcuts

449
00:26:39,837 --> 00:26:41,058
to make your own keyboard shortcuts.

450
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:42,158
So here's an example of something

451
00:26:42,158 --> 00:26:42,818
that I guess is just a cute comment.

452
00:26:42,818 --> 00:26:43,798
So in many ways, some of these keyboard shortcuts

453
00:26:43,798 --> 00:26:44,938
have contributed to there's anapparent lack

454
00:26:44,938 --> 00:26:49,560
of notion of quality control for some things.

455
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:57,038
is infamous for having a lot of things that you can do all on the controller at one time.

456
00:26:57,038 --> 00:27:04,321
So actually hitting L1 and going into aim mode took the whole mapping of actions that

457
00:27:04,321 --> 00:27:09,422
you could do and remapped it to something else. And while this allowed for a lot of

458
00:27:09,422 --> 00:27:13,624
freedom and a lot of expression, it also inhibited players when they were playing the game because

459
00:27:13,624 --> 00:27:16,364
they were constantly switching modes. And so...

460
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:21,950
I was really excited to go to Sucker Punch because I love the Infamous games and now

461
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:25,562
I get to help them sort of...

462
00:27:26,099 --> 00:27:30,622
reduce the complexity of the control scheme a little bit using something that I'm calling

463
00:27:30,622 --> 00:27:35,466
random access game design because I love to invent buzzwords. But basically that means

464
00:27:35,466 --> 00:27:40,449
everything that you can do is always available all the time. One action per button. There's

465
00:27:40,449 --> 00:27:45,333
no two-step process to cause any of these common actions. And what that means is if

466
00:27:45,333 --> 00:27:50,296
it doesn't fit on the controller, you're going to have to cut it. And that will help your

467
00:27:50,296 --> 00:27:53,598
game even though it feels like what you're doing is removing things that the player can

468
00:27:53,598 --> 00:27:53,698
do.

469
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:59,823
So moving a little bit further down to the right,

470
00:27:59,823 --> 00:28:01,764
we get kind of uncommon actions.

471
00:28:01,764 --> 00:28:05,026
These are actions that don't happen very often.

472
00:28:05,026 --> 00:28:08,247
They're not as often kind of like under a time pressure.

473
00:28:08,247 --> 00:28:11,469
So this would be things like jumping or reloading.

474
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:19,906
And what's important there is that the player have a kind of a high understanding for what's going on and what their abilities are.

475
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:23,369
Because you have more than you can really keep in mind at any given time.

476
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:28,994
The game needs to be kind of cluing you in that now's a good time to use it.

477
00:28:30,923 --> 00:28:34,866
That's what she said is sort of an example of an uncommon action.

478
00:28:34,866 --> 00:28:37,368
You can just be participating in a conversation, you're trying to

479
00:28:37,368 --> 00:28:40,630
communicate, and then somebody will say something that

480
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:43,752
that's what she said will just pop into your mind, right? And we're really thinking about it

481
00:28:43,752 --> 00:28:47,394
constantly. It was an uncommon thing, but as soon as the moment is right, you know it's

482
00:28:47,394 --> 00:28:47,935
time to use it.

483
00:28:50,789 --> 00:28:56,013
So, um, Bulletstorm has a great example of this sort of that's what she said, uh, kind

484
00:28:56,013 --> 00:29:01,839
of action, um, in its skill shots. Um, so, skill shots are super important in the game.

485
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:08,104
They, they drive your progression, um, they're heavily featured in the marketing. And one

486
00:29:08,104 --> 00:29:10,867
kind of skill shot is the environmental skill shot, where you're knocking some guy into

487
00:29:10,867 --> 00:29:13,930
a spike trap or off a cliff or into a, a...

488
00:29:15,331 --> 00:29:20,073
oven or lots of disturbing ways to kill people.

489
00:29:20,073 --> 00:29:23,034
And it's important that for these uncommon actions

490
00:29:23,034 --> 00:29:26,635
that the player's not in control of the pace.

491
00:29:26,635 --> 00:29:29,996
So the onus is not on him to control

492
00:29:29,996 --> 00:29:31,737
when this is going to happen.

493
00:29:31,737 --> 00:29:33,118
It's just sort of the environment

494
00:29:33,118 --> 00:29:35,939
dictates when these options are available.

495
00:29:35,939 --> 00:29:38,580
And that means there's these really strong external cues.

496
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,740
Like if there's no giant spike trap,

497
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:42,361
then you can't use your spike trap kill shot.

498
00:29:44,026 --> 00:29:48,221
On the other hand, the weapon-specific skillshots

499
00:29:48,221 --> 00:29:50,369
don't follow these rules.

500
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:53,439
They are set by the player.

501
00:29:53,439 --> 00:29:56,442
You can theoretically use them at any time.

502
00:29:56,442 --> 00:29:58,543
But when you're playing it, you actually

503
00:29:58,543 --> 00:30:00,725
end up going into the menu and figuring out

504
00:30:00,725 --> 00:30:01,806
which one you're going to try to do next,

505
00:30:01,806 --> 00:30:03,867
then going back into the game.

506
00:30:03,867 --> 00:30:05,628
It's not a very fluid process.

507
00:30:05,628 --> 00:30:07,950
And usually, these kill shots are not

508
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:11,152
as efficient as regular just shooting guys.

509
00:30:11,152 --> 00:30:15,195
And so you're not as incented to do them.

510
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:20,672
And then finally, all the way in the lower right

511
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,572
are prompted actions.

512
00:30:21,572 --> 00:30:24,013
So these are actions that are totally untimed.

513
00:30:24,013 --> 00:30:25,914
There's no time pressure.

514
00:30:25,914 --> 00:30:28,475
And that means you can have as many of these as you want.

515
00:30:28,475 --> 00:30:30,916
Because you're going to have to tell the player how

516
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:33,057
to do them every single time.

517
00:30:33,057 --> 00:30:37,938
Borderlands is a great example of this.

518
00:30:37,938 --> 00:30:40,460
They took the action gameplay that Gearbox

519
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:43,681
had been doing before, and they added this.

520
00:30:44,391 --> 00:30:48,955
offline almost, uh, loot, uh, stream, where, uh, you can

521
00:30:48,955 --> 00:30:51,197
gather money after a fight, you're, you're comparing

522
00:30:51,197 --> 00:30:53,659
weapons in the UI, you're equipping items. But none of

523
00:30:53,659 --> 00:30:56,521
this has to be done in the context of action, so it's,

524
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:59,844
uh, it's just, it's just addition, it's not actually

525
00:30:59,844 --> 00:31:01,865
increasing the system requirements for the game.

526
00:31:03,288 --> 00:31:05,411
except when it comes to health packs.

527
00:31:05,411 --> 00:31:07,294
Health packs are picked up in the exact same way,

528
00:31:07,294 --> 00:31:08,636
but a lot of times you're in a fight

529
00:31:08,636 --> 00:31:09,437
and you need it right now,

530
00:31:09,437 --> 00:31:12,261
and so you're trying to look around for the one health pack

531
00:31:12,261 --> 00:31:14,344
and you're trying to aim at it so you can pick it up.

532
00:31:14,344 --> 00:31:17,028
This puts a lot of pressure into a corner of the graph

533
00:31:17,028 --> 00:31:18,671
that doesn't support pressure very well.

534
00:31:22,532 --> 00:31:27,716
So moving past constraints, constraints

535
00:31:27,716 --> 00:31:31,979
allow you to limit the area that the player is

536
00:31:31,979 --> 00:31:34,000
going to be able to interact.

537
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,441
And so the next part of the design process

538
00:31:35,441 --> 00:31:36,422
is to look at the interactions.

539
00:31:36,422 --> 00:31:37,143
Let's talk about Pac-Man.

540
00:31:37,143 --> 00:31:39,364
So even at a really early age, and I

541
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:43,988
think this might have been my very first video game,

542
00:31:43,988 --> 00:31:46,189
I was super sensitive to details.

543
00:31:46,189 --> 00:31:50,152
And because of that, I never really got into Pac-Man.

544
00:31:51,067 --> 00:31:53,609
And I didn't find out until 30 years later why.

545
00:31:53,609 --> 00:31:57,113
Basically, in Japan, they use four-way sticks, right?

546
00:31:57,113 --> 00:31:59,715
And that's why the cardinal directions of Pac-Man

547
00:31:59,715 --> 00:32:01,677
make total sense, and it works really well.

548
00:32:02,283 --> 00:32:05,565
But American arcades, uh, use 8-way sticks and a lot of times

549
00:32:05,565 --> 00:32:08,668
they didn't ship over the whole arcade unit, they just shipped

550
00:32:08,668 --> 00:32:12,111
over the ROMs so they would plug it into an 8-way, uh, arcade

551
00:32:12,111 --> 00:32:16,134
stick and, um, so Pac-Man was all of a sudden getting these

552
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:19,777
diagonal inputs, which would, it would ignore. Which is fine,

553
00:32:19,777 --> 00:32:23,860
except for it also ignores the next input. So if you're trying

554
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:27,363
to roll around a corner in, in Pac-Man in an American arcade,

555
00:32:27,363 --> 00:32:29,645
you're gonna just ram into the wall and all of a sudden Pac-Man

556
00:32:29,645 --> 00:32:31,286
is gonna stop and you're gonna get caught by the ghosts.

557
00:32:35,135 --> 00:32:38,237
Another example of how physical limitations impact your

558
00:32:38,237 --> 00:32:39,798
interactions is Dungeon Hunter.

559
00:32:39,798 --> 00:32:44,320
It's a iOS game, very similar to like a Diablo.

560
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,722
And like a ton of iOS games, it has virtual buttons, which

561
00:32:48,722 --> 00:32:50,783
means your fingers are always on the screen, and you're

562
00:32:50,783 --> 00:32:55,206
trying to do reaction time tests on something that's not

563
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:57,147
giving you any feedback.

564
00:32:57,147 --> 00:32:57,927
It's very difficult.

565
00:32:57,927 --> 00:32:59,588
Not to say it's not a good game.

566
00:32:59,588 --> 00:33:01,449
It actually is a pretty good game.

567
00:33:01,449 --> 00:33:02,910
But you really feel the limitations.

568
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:03,630
Oops.

569
00:33:04,677 --> 00:33:10,598
Whereas, Infinity Blade uses gestures, which is what the device is meant for.

570
00:33:10,598 --> 00:33:14,699
It has pretty infrequent input compared to the length of a fight, so most of the time

571
00:33:14,699 --> 00:33:17,079
you're looking at the fantastic graphics.

572
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:23,621
And even though it's a game about timing, it's not reaction time test.

573
00:33:23,621 --> 00:33:25,921
You can see every blow being telegraphed.

574
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:32,582
It's more about timing your block or dodge to the animation and not reacting to what's

575
00:33:32,582 --> 00:33:33,102
on the screen.

576
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:38,100
And these guys did an excellent job of porting the details of PunchOut as well.

577
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:44,971
Responsiveness is a big part of interactions.

578
00:33:44,971 --> 00:33:47,872
Doing something and then having something happen.

579
00:33:47,872 --> 00:33:50,694
Gunstringer has got a ton of personality.

580
00:33:50,694 --> 00:33:53,995
And you're basically moving a crosshair with your hand

581
00:33:53,995 --> 00:33:55,356
in front of the Kinect.

582
00:33:55,356 --> 00:33:57,296
But it's heavily smooth because they

583
00:33:57,296 --> 00:33:59,717
didn't want a lot of jittering on the crosshair.

584
00:33:59,717 --> 00:34:01,358
So what that means is that you're

585
00:34:01,358 --> 00:34:04,339
experiencing about 100 milliseconds of delay

586
00:34:04,339 --> 00:34:05,780
between moving your hand and seeing

587
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:07,861
what's happening on the screen.

588
00:34:08,701 --> 00:34:11,662
And your brain actually will take

589
00:34:11,662 --> 00:34:13,663
events that are less than 100 milliseconds apart

590
00:34:13,663 --> 00:34:15,104
and merge them into one event.

591
00:34:15,104 --> 00:34:17,865
That's why sound sync in a movie works,

592
00:34:17,865 --> 00:34:19,286
even though it's not exact.

593
00:34:19,286 --> 00:34:22,107
But on the other hand, if it's more than 100 milliseconds,

594
00:34:22,107 --> 00:34:23,648
you're going to perceive it as two different things.

595
00:34:23,648 --> 00:34:25,749
And so if it's intended to be one thing,

596
00:34:25,749 --> 00:34:28,931
it's going to be very disorienting.

597
00:34:28,931 --> 00:34:30,451
Fruit Ninja, on the other hand, kind of

598
00:34:30,451 --> 00:34:32,612
smooths the spline in real time when you're swinging

599
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:34,293
your hand across the screen.

600
00:34:34,293 --> 00:34:35,214
And there's no delay.

601
00:34:35,214 --> 00:34:37,235
And so it feels a lot more one to one.

602
00:34:41,907 --> 00:34:45,449
Responsiveness is a huge part of any shooter game.

603
00:34:45,449 --> 00:34:48,550
Halo 3 clocked in at about 100 milliseconds,

604
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:51,892
which was a little over three frames at 30 frames per second.

605
00:34:51,892 --> 00:34:55,594
Which is, again, right at that line

606
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:59,497
for things feeling simultaneous.

607
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:01,117
Killzone 2, on the other hand, because of how

608
00:35:01,117 --> 00:35:03,559
they were doing their rendering, had

609
00:35:03,983 --> 00:35:11,169
up to 150 milliseconds of kind of delay before your input was recognized.

610
00:35:11,169 --> 00:35:16,993
And that turned off a lot of like professional gamers who were sensitive enough to need that

611
00:35:16,993 --> 00:35:18,775
instant responsiveness.

612
00:35:18,775 --> 00:35:22,177
Right now the current king of this is the Call of Duty guys.

613
00:35:22,177 --> 00:35:27,221
They run at 60 and they have all, I mean, they're approaching kind of the theoretical

614
00:35:27,221 --> 00:35:30,664
minimum for how much responsiveness delay you're going to have.

615
00:35:35,971 --> 00:35:39,052
even after you've got the players input, you have to interpret it.

616
00:35:39,052 --> 00:35:43,494
And when we were making Halo, TimeSplitters was a game we were playing a lot,

617
00:35:43,494 --> 00:35:46,455
and they were practicing auto-aim, which meant

618
00:35:46,455 --> 00:35:48,696
your bullets are coming out of the gun and kind of getting

619
00:35:48,696 --> 00:35:50,456
aimed toward enemies.

620
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:56,502
And because of that, there were all kinds of frustrations where you were trying to do

621
00:35:56,502 --> 00:35:59,743
one thing and you couldn't, like your gun would actually be behind a wall even though

622
00:35:59,743 --> 00:36:03,364
your crosshair wasn't, so you'd be shooting the wall and not realize it. Or you'd be trying

623
00:36:03,364 --> 00:36:08,886
to turn and because they didn't want you to turn too fast, you just couldn't get around

624
00:36:08,886 --> 00:36:11,467
and some guy was shooting you in the back.

625
00:36:11,467 --> 00:36:15,749
So for Halo, we went more in an interpretive direction with aim assist, where we're trying

626
00:36:15,749 --> 00:36:18,910
to figure out what the player's doing instead of what they're saying they're doing.

627
00:36:19,668 --> 00:36:28,311
That means that in Halo you shoot from the crosshair, not from the gun. You can stick the gun in a bush and your bullets will come right out of the center of the camera.

628
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:37,334
Pegging the stick actually makes you turn faster, like it continues to accelerate, because essentially what you're telling us is, man, I wish this stick went really far.

629
00:36:37,334 --> 00:36:47,758
And then when you stop giving us input over an enemy, it actually slows down on them right away, much faster than if you slow down just over an object that you're not probably intending to shoot at.

630
00:36:51,257 --> 00:36:56,300
Sly Cooper does a super good job of this as well.

631
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,762
When you jump in Sly, it's mostly vertical.

632
00:36:58,762 --> 00:37:01,804
So if you do something you didn't intend, you can

633
00:37:01,804 --> 00:37:03,645
probably get back to where you were.

634
00:37:03,645 --> 00:37:06,187
It steers you the entire time toward where

635
00:37:06,187 --> 00:37:06,768
you're going to land.

636
00:37:06,768 --> 00:37:08,309
And that allows you to really stick the

637
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:09,870
landing in a lot of cases.

638
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:10,770
Whereas Prince of Persia.

639
00:37:12,489 --> 00:37:15,210
does more of a jump prediction thing where they're trying to figure out where you're

640
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:17,092
jumping to at the moment that you jump

641
00:37:17,092 --> 00:37:18,973
and it's mostly horizontal jumps so

642
00:37:18,973 --> 00:37:22,055
if you tell it to jump and it can't find a place for you to go

643
00:37:22,055 --> 00:37:24,157
it's just going to throw you out into space

644
00:37:24,157 --> 00:37:28,400
which is fine because then you can rewind it but uh... a lot of times it felt like

645
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,802
you weren't in control of what the prince was doing

646
00:37:36,188 --> 00:37:38,790
I'll just skip that slide.

647
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:45,093
Another way that interactions are flavored in one detail

648
00:37:45,093 --> 00:37:49,155
can affect the entire game, you can see in Resident Evil,

649
00:37:49,155 --> 00:37:51,597
where they're trying to get you to aim under pressure.

650
00:37:51,597 --> 00:37:53,618
They're trying to have scarce resources.

651
00:37:53,618 --> 00:37:56,119
But what ended up being in their game with the details

652
00:37:56,119 --> 00:37:58,280
they picked was you just can't move while you're shooting,

653
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:02,763
which is high pressure, but also feels like you're limited.

654
00:38:03,127 --> 00:38:05,729
And then they just greatly restrict the ammo, so any time

655
00:38:05,729 --> 00:38:08,311
you miss, you feel like you failed.

656
00:38:08,311 --> 00:38:11,793
Whereas Dead Space does a much better job of this, because

657
00:38:11,793 --> 00:38:15,315
they are requiring you to shoot at different points.

658
00:38:15,315 --> 00:38:17,777
And those points are often moving a lot more than a head.

659
00:38:17,777 --> 00:38:20,798
So you're still under an equal amount of pressure, but they

660
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,860
can give you really responsive controls, because what they're

661
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,461
asking you to do is much more difficult.

662
00:38:24,461 --> 00:38:27,483
And then they do a good job of algorithmically figuring out

663
00:38:27,483 --> 00:38:29,844
what you need, what ammo you're using.

664
00:38:29,844 --> 00:38:31,905
And so you never feel like you have enough ammo, but

665
00:38:31,905 --> 00:38:32,586
secretly, you always do.

666
00:38:36,155 --> 00:38:39,137
Rewards are a big impact in interactions.

667
00:38:39,137 --> 00:38:46,063
And what's often difficult is to line up the rewards

668
00:38:46,063 --> 00:38:49,867
with a certain kind of activity.

669
00:38:49,867 --> 00:38:52,249
So you don't want them to clash.

670
00:38:52,249 --> 00:38:55,031
In lots and lots of games that have good or evil systems,

671
00:38:55,031 --> 00:38:56,072
they're promising you this choice.

672
00:38:56,072 --> 00:38:57,914
And then they're going to give you power

673
00:38:57,914 --> 00:39:00,236
if you make it to the end of either the good or evil

674
00:39:00,236 --> 00:39:02,978
spectrum, which means you really don't have a choice.

675
00:39:03,338 --> 00:39:06,739
And so the rewards are diminishing the activity in a way.

676
00:39:06,739 --> 00:39:08,820
I think of it like this.

677
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:11,701
Calories are like a fundamental human need.

678
00:39:11,701 --> 00:39:15,742
We've evolved all these systems to reinforce that we need calories.

679
00:39:15,742 --> 00:39:19,343
And so what happens is when you eat sugar, your body releases insulin.

680
00:39:20,192 --> 00:39:23,733
before you get the calories, kind of in anticipation,

681
00:39:23,733 --> 00:39:26,174
you're gonna process the glucose, which is the sugar,

682
00:39:26,174 --> 00:39:28,275
and you're gonna get those calories, right?

683
00:39:28,275 --> 00:39:29,535
And then it releases serotonin,

684
00:39:29,535 --> 00:39:34,457
which is sort of a hormone that makes you feel satisfied.

685
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:37,330
The problem comes when you eat fake sugar,

686
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:40,391
your body still releases insulin,

687
00:39:40,391 --> 00:39:42,892
but there's no glucose to process.

688
00:39:42,892 --> 00:39:44,293
You don't actually get the calories,

689
00:39:44,293 --> 00:39:46,274
so no serotonin is released,

690
00:39:46,274 --> 00:39:48,074
and you end up with hypoglycemia,

691
00:39:48,074 --> 00:39:50,795
low blood sugar, or insulin problems.

692
00:39:50,795 --> 00:39:53,696
So fake sugar actually, in a lot of cases,

693
00:39:53,696 --> 00:39:54,737
leads to weight gain,

694
00:39:54,737 --> 00:39:56,778
because what you really want is serotonin,

695
00:39:56,778 --> 00:39:58,818
and not just calories.

696
00:40:00,436 --> 00:40:01,256
Games are very similar.

697
00:40:01,256 --> 00:40:04,117
I believe that players have sort of fundamental

698
00:40:04,117 --> 00:40:05,038
psychological needs.

699
00:40:05,038 --> 00:40:06,858
It doesn't matter how you classify them.

700
00:40:06,858 --> 00:40:10,380
They can be subdivided in lots of different ways.

701
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:13,001
And when you're playing a game,

702
00:40:13,001 --> 00:40:16,502
the game kind of sets up the conditions for success

703
00:40:16,502 --> 00:40:18,403
and makes you want to aspire to them.

704
00:40:18,403 --> 00:40:19,723
And so you're making these attempts

705
00:40:19,723 --> 00:40:22,264
and eventually you're going to succeed.

706
00:40:22,264 --> 00:40:25,866
And then only after you experience actual success

707
00:40:25,866 --> 00:40:27,186
is dopamine gonna get released

708
00:40:27,186 --> 00:40:29,547
and you get that kind of feeling of satisfaction.

709
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:33,587
So just like with calories, the real reward there,

710
00:40:33,587 --> 00:40:34,890
chemical reward that you're seeking,

711
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:38,157
can only happen after an authentic success.

712
00:40:39,948 --> 00:40:44,009
Whereas gamification is actually frustrating in a similar way

713
00:40:44,009 --> 00:40:47,149
to fake sugar, because it skips the actual success.

714
00:40:47,149 --> 00:40:48,349
And so instead of getting dopamine,

715
00:40:48,349 --> 00:40:50,090
you're just going to get frustrated,

716
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:52,650
and you're going to feel like this activity is futile.

717
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:55,891
Even though it looks from the outside just

718
00:40:55,891 --> 00:40:58,611
like a regular success cycle, you're

719
00:40:58,611 --> 00:41:00,351
cutting out the actual important part.

720
00:41:00,351 --> 00:41:01,452
So there's lots of ways to increase

721
00:41:01,452 --> 00:41:06,793
the effectiveness of this cycle.

722
00:41:08,226 --> 00:41:14,227
What you want to do is increase the connection between the success and the dopamine by making

723
00:41:14,227 --> 00:41:18,088
sure that the rewards you're giving the player match the activity that they were participating

724
00:41:18,088 --> 00:41:24,510
in, both kind of the flavor or the spirit of the activity, the timing of the activity.

725
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:28,971
You don't want to undercut all the failed attempts that the player made by making the

726
00:41:28,971 --> 00:41:33,072
success too easy or unavoidable.

727
00:41:36,263 --> 00:41:40,909
Assassin's Creed has struggled with this, it's much better than the most recent games

728
00:41:40,909 --> 00:41:41,790
of the first one.

729
00:41:42,992 --> 00:41:47,494
They give you things to do like flag collecting, where they force you to do it.

730
00:41:47,494 --> 00:41:50,635
When you picked up one, they were like, great, you only have a million more to go.

731
00:41:50,635 --> 00:41:53,076
And they didn't really even tell you what the reward was going to be.

732
00:41:53,076 --> 00:41:56,218
And from the outside, that looks like a reward loop,

733
00:41:56,218 --> 00:42:00,720
but because the activity doesn't match the reward in any way,

734
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,721
it's not very effective at getting players to keep playing.

735
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:07,382
The investigations were really similar to this, where they would force you to do some of it,

736
00:42:07,382 --> 00:42:12,225
and then there was this really unclear, oh, your assassinations are going to get easier.

737
00:42:12,445 --> 00:42:15,669
But they were mistaking a character defect,

738
00:42:15,669 --> 00:42:19,134
completionism, with an actual motivation.

739
00:42:19,134 --> 00:42:23,360
And they were conflating just like checking off boxes

740
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:27,426
with actually successfully meeting some needs.

741
00:42:29,034 --> 00:42:31,635
Batman, on the other hand, nails this really, really well.

742
00:42:31,635 --> 00:42:34,916
Like the interview tapes, they never tell you

743
00:42:34,916 --> 00:42:36,156
that they're even there.

744
00:42:36,156 --> 00:42:39,437
You just kind of find one, and it opens up the UI.

745
00:42:39,437 --> 00:42:40,617
So it's not forced.

746
00:42:40,617 --> 00:42:42,898
They're rewarding your autonomy really well.

747
00:42:42,898 --> 00:42:45,779
And then the reward that you get is instant.

748
00:42:45,779 --> 00:42:48,020
The first time you pick one up, you get a little bit of story.

749
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:49,480
And then you're like, OK, well, I'm

750
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,061
going to pick up another one, and I'm

751
00:42:51,061 --> 00:42:52,281
going to get a little bit more story.

752
00:42:53,914 --> 00:42:58,936
And the trophies kind of do this in a similar way for a different need.

753
00:42:58,936 --> 00:43:01,318
Again, you find them by exploring, they're enforced on you,

754
00:43:01,318 --> 00:43:05,480
and they're rewarding your competence at finding these things with

755
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:08,541
something that a competence player really values, which is trophies.

756
00:43:08,541 --> 00:43:12,903
I looked it up, and like 20% of all the trophies in Batman are about Riddler trophies.

757
00:43:12,903 --> 00:43:16,085
And then also the Riddler, like,

758
00:43:16,085 --> 00:43:19,986
gives you a voicemail or something where he's really pissed,

759
00:43:19,986 --> 00:43:22,968
and that is something that a competence player really is attracted to.

760
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:29,304
Another way you can increase the power of this cycle is by just

761
00:43:29,304 --> 00:43:33,105
amplifying the amount of dopamine that the player gets.

762
00:43:33,105 --> 00:43:34,626
If you want a good lesson in this,

763
00:43:34,626 --> 00:43:37,226
you should just go to Las Vegas, because those guys are

764
00:43:37,226 --> 00:43:38,187
dopamine masters.

765
00:43:38,187 --> 00:43:39,007
Game Center, which is Apple's sort of, um.

766
00:43:47,337 --> 00:43:50,479
uh... a platform achievement system is uh...

767
00:43:50,479 --> 00:43:53,480
is is terrible at this.

768
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,981
The notifications that you got an achievement are

769
00:43:55,981 --> 00:43:58,662
are delayed by seemingly arbitrary ways.

770
00:43:58,662 --> 00:44:02,984
The skin is like this antique billiard table which just does not

771
00:44:02,984 --> 00:44:07,006
match at all the feeling that you're getting from inside of the game.

772
00:44:07,006 --> 00:44:08,287
There's no um... celebration or

773
00:44:08,287 --> 00:44:10,988
uh... uh... sort of

774
00:44:10,988 --> 00:44:12,629
pomp to the awards at all.

775
00:44:12,629 --> 00:44:14,769
They're not actually valuable.

776
00:44:15,509 --> 00:44:18,937
Which means that they're poor at giving you dopamine.

777
00:44:18,937 --> 00:44:21,483
Batman, on the other hand, does this great.

778
00:44:23,322 --> 00:44:28,164
the rewards are always given right at the moment where you realize that you were successful.

779
00:44:28,164 --> 00:44:31,885
It's not given at the moment that you're actually successful. It actually delays it a little

780
00:44:31,885 --> 00:44:36,847
bit so you get this chance to anticipate and go, oh yeah, I know what's coming. Then there's

781
00:44:36,847 --> 00:44:40,989
bats everywhere and the music swells. And then like in the case of the combo meter,

782
00:44:40,989 --> 00:44:44,510
they actually like count out every single point and this meter goes up and it takes a long

783
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:48,692
time. And then what they're giving you is actually valuable. You can actually use those

784
00:44:48,692 --> 00:44:51,493
points to purchase something. And so you attach more meaning to them.

785
00:44:51,993 --> 00:44:53,253
uh... so that makes it great for for dopamine

786
00:44:53,253 --> 00:44:53,734
and then finally to uh...

787
00:44:53,734 --> 00:44:54,474
to strengthen this uh... reward cycle is uh...

788
00:45:04,247 --> 00:45:07,610
to reward an activity with more of that activity.

789
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:10,654
And this is probably the most important thing I ever learned in GDC.

790
00:45:10,654 --> 00:45:12,776
It was after a talk I gave, I was talking to Scott Rigby,

791
00:45:12,776 --> 00:45:16,940
who's a psychologist and researcher, and he also does, like, consulting for different game companies.

792
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:21,545
I said, so what is the best reward for when somebody does something?

793
00:45:21,545 --> 00:45:25,109
And he said exactly this, reward an activity with more of that activity.

794
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:29,583
So the best example in my mind of this is the original World of Warcraft.

795
00:45:29,583 --> 00:45:36,587
There's all kinds of things you can do in the game, leveling, gathering resources, raiding, playing PvP.

796
00:45:36,587 --> 00:45:39,649
And all of those lead to more of the same things.

797
00:45:39,649 --> 00:45:42,210
So as you level, they give you more levels.

798
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:44,451
When you're crafting, that allows you to craft new things.

799
00:45:44,451 --> 00:45:49,374
When you're PvPing, that gives you items that are specifically geared to PvP.

800
00:45:49,374 --> 00:45:50,575
And there's sort of one...

801
00:45:51,336 --> 00:45:55,893
outlier which is you have to level all the way through before you can really get into the rating.

802
00:45:57,713 --> 00:46:00,916
And because every designer has to have a personal theory about

803
00:46:00,916 --> 00:46:04,219
why WoW is a visible failure, here's mine.

804
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:09,803
The current WoW, they've sort of lost that flow, where

805
00:46:09,803 --> 00:46:12,465
sometimes they sped up the leveling, and you're going to

806
00:46:12,465 --> 00:46:13,306
hit the level cap a lot earlier.

807
00:46:13,306 --> 00:46:15,888
And if you're not a good crafter, then you can't go

808
00:46:15,888 --> 00:46:18,430
raiding, because you don't have the right crafter bonuses.

809
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:20,972
And then there's all kinds of things that kind of go back.

810
00:46:20,972 --> 00:46:22,314
And it's just a mess.

811
00:46:22,314 --> 00:46:22,694
Where.

812
00:46:24,695 --> 00:46:28,699
You can't, you end up having to do things that you don't want to do in order to get the rewards

813
00:46:28,699 --> 00:46:35,484
that you want. You've got all kinds of like cross purposes and the different reward cycles.

814
00:46:35,484 --> 00:46:40,588
So yeah, again, totally dismal failure.

815
00:46:40,588 --> 00:46:44,692
Batman on the other hand does this really well.

816
00:46:44,692 --> 00:46:50,817
One of them that I talked about earlier is combat XP. So you're building these combos.

817
00:46:51,665 --> 00:46:58,693
you're fighting well and what that does is that gives you the ability to buy upgrades

818
00:46:58,693 --> 00:47:02,318
that make you fight better. So instantly then you're incented to go back into the fight

819
00:47:02,318 --> 00:47:06,422
and continue this activity you actually enjoy. The challenge rooms are again a great example

820
00:47:06,422 --> 00:47:10,768
of this. You beat a series of challenge rooms and that unlocks more challenge rooms.

821
00:47:13,975 --> 00:47:18,598
So the next step in the design process, or at least my design process, beyond interactions

822
00:47:18,598 --> 00:47:23,281
is something that I'm calling harmonics. And this is still something that I'm kind of figuring

823
00:47:23,281 --> 00:47:28,385
out as we go, so this is going to feel a little bit more experimental than some of the other

824
00:47:28,385 --> 00:47:32,788
sections. So I started with a concept, like 2D platformer, right? Mario Brothers. Your

825
00:47:32,788 --> 00:47:36,870
guys run to the right, sometimes you have to kill enemies, sometimes you have to jump

826
00:47:36,870 --> 00:47:40,073
pits, and then ultimately you're going to fight a boss at the end.

827
00:47:40,743 --> 00:47:42,883
And there's lots of different games that fall into that sort

828
00:47:42,883 --> 00:47:45,844
of same rough concept, but then they do the details different.

829
00:47:45,844 --> 00:47:48,205
I'll explore a little bit how I think that

830
00:47:48,205 --> 00:47:50,145
affects the ultimate game.

831
00:47:50,145 --> 00:47:52,446
So the constraints in Mario, you always

832
00:47:52,446 --> 00:47:54,526
have to go to the right.

833
00:47:54,526 --> 00:47:55,146
You can jump.

834
00:47:55,146 --> 00:47:57,187
You can stomp on guys.

835
00:47:57,187 --> 00:48:00,848
And then you're going to get mushrooms

836
00:48:00,848 --> 00:48:04,548
that will make you big, which is essentially like one hit point.

837
00:48:06,410 --> 00:48:09,110
uh... and what that leads to is uh...

838
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:13,092
sort of one frequency of challenge where

839
00:48:13,092 --> 00:48:16,693
uh... you run to the right and then you jump a pit, and then you run to the right and then you jump a pit

840
00:48:16,693 --> 00:48:17,953
or you'll stomp on an enemy

841
00:48:17,953 --> 00:48:18,953
or you'll jump another pit.

842
00:48:18,953 --> 00:48:19,214
and then

843
00:48:19,214 --> 00:48:20,834
the health

844
00:48:20,834 --> 00:48:22,454
sort of system

845
00:48:22,454 --> 00:48:29,136
uh... leads to just just two levels right you're small, you're big, you're small, you're big, you fall in a pit, you're dead.

846
00:48:33,037 --> 00:48:36,941
Sonic the Hedgehog on the other hand, it's still go right, but instead of

847
00:48:36,941 --> 00:48:40,244
jumping and stomping on guys, you actually just jump into guys.

848
00:48:40,244 --> 00:48:44,187
So, that helps them

849
00:48:44,187 --> 00:48:46,689
maintain this

850
00:48:46,689 --> 00:48:48,831
sense of momentum and forward progress.

851
00:48:48,831 --> 00:48:52,534
And then you collect rings and

852
00:48:52,534 --> 00:48:55,057
much like being big in Mario,

853
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:58,500
it's kind of a life insurance policy. So if you get hit, you're going to lose all your rings,

854
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:59,260
but you're not going to die.

855
00:49:00,118 --> 00:49:06,101
So the cycle's a little bit less interesting at first,

856
00:49:06,101 --> 00:49:09,983
because instead of jump over a pit or stomp on an enemy,

857
00:49:09,983 --> 00:49:12,364
you jump over a pit and jump into an enemy.

858
00:49:12,364 --> 00:49:15,566
So it's a little bit more of a simple action.

859
00:49:17,108 --> 00:49:21,610
And then the health system, basically as soon as you get

860
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:23,731
hit, you're also in your switching mode, you're

861
00:49:23,731 --> 00:49:24,892
scrambling to collect rings.

862
00:49:24,892 --> 00:49:27,513
But it's really easy to pick up a ring after you get hit.

863
00:49:27,513 --> 00:49:29,934
And so you don't actually spend very much time in that

864
00:49:29,934 --> 00:49:31,755
collecting ring mentality.

865
00:49:31,755 --> 00:49:34,076
You almost always just have rings.

866
00:49:34,076 --> 00:49:37,357
Megaman, on the other hand, adds a lot more constraints

867
00:49:37,357 --> 00:49:39,978
that make their frequencies and harmonics a little bit

868
00:49:39,978 --> 00:49:40,698
more interesting.

869
00:49:41,602 --> 00:49:47,088
uh... so you're not always going right sometimes you're going up, sometimes you're going down

870
00:49:47,088 --> 00:49:48,850
uh... megaman has hit points

871
00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:54,617
and the enemies have hit points right so instead of a single moment of interaction

872
00:49:54,617 --> 00:49:58,242
sometimes you're taking damage sometimes they're taking damage you get these

873
00:49:58,242 --> 00:49:59,463
small little oscillations

874
00:50:01,936 --> 00:50:08,501
And then, uh, because you have health bar, it'll start out full and it'll slowly go down,

875
00:50:08,501 --> 00:50:12,064
slowly go down until you finish a level or get a power up and it'll go back up. Same

876
00:50:12,064 --> 00:50:17,868
thing happens with ammo. So what's interesting about harmonics is that, um, the same constraints

877
00:50:17,868 --> 00:50:23,493
in a different circumstance, uh, can produce just drastically different harmonics. And

878
00:50:23,493 --> 00:50:27,816
for a platformer, that, uh, change of keys, if you will, is a boss fight.

879
00:50:29,505 --> 00:50:34,550
So in Mario, basically the harmonics just flatten, right?

880
00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:37,814
If you're big, you run right through Bowser and you win.

881
00:50:37,814 --> 00:50:42,058
And if you're small, you're gonna get stomped by Bowser.

882
00:50:42,058 --> 00:50:47,884
And maybe you can make it through, but it's mostly luck.

883
00:50:47,884 --> 00:50:51,787
So the constraints of Mario actually don't hold up

884
00:50:51,787 --> 00:50:53,329
the boss fight conditions.

885
00:50:55,921 --> 00:51:00,384
Sonic holds up maybe a little bit better, but the problem with a boss fight in Sonic is that

886
00:51:00,384 --> 00:51:04,848
the enemy boss is going to hurt you by running into you, and you're going to hurt the boss by running into him.

887
00:51:04,848 --> 00:51:09,531
So determining who's running into who just becomes kind of a fuzzy concept for the player.

888
00:51:09,531 --> 00:51:15,155
And also, you're going to jump into a boss, and whereas normal enemies would just die instantly,

889
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:18,618
the boss is not going to die instantly, so all of a sudden you're going to be standing in the boss,

890
00:51:18,618 --> 00:51:21,460
and maybe he's just going to hit you before you can get out of him.

891
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:23,541
And then the ring concept...

892
00:51:24,638 --> 00:51:29,681
uh... breaks down pretty pretty heavily in a boss fight because

893
00:51:29,681 --> 00:51:34,324
uh... you basically have infinite life as long as you have one ring and you can always

894
00:51:34,324 --> 00:51:35,084
grab it before you get hit again.

895
00:51:35,084 --> 00:51:39,327
Mega Men on the other hand with a little bit more complexity in their constraints, they actually

896
00:51:39,327 --> 00:51:41,889
their system blossoms when you get to a boss uh... so

897
00:51:41,889 --> 00:51:46,472
uh... the health bars set up a longer fight between you and a boss and the

898
00:51:46,472 --> 00:51:48,793
fact that you can have different ammo types

899
00:51:48,793 --> 00:51:52,275
set up this whole uh... kind of matrix of what weapon you're going to use against who.

900
00:51:55,619 --> 00:52:00,463
So some other things that control harmonics are pace setters.

901
00:52:00,463 --> 00:52:02,765
Not on purpose, both of the talks I've given before

902
00:52:02,765 --> 00:52:05,747
were about pace setters, so increasing the time

903
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:07,649
between shots for the sniper rifle

904
00:52:07,649 --> 00:52:09,130
will slow down the harmonics.

905
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:14,815
And decreasing the rate of velocity of the plasma bolt

906
00:52:14,815 --> 00:52:18,478
actually makes the fight shorter.

907
00:52:18,478 --> 00:52:20,100
Sort of before I had really landed

908
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:21,161
on this concept of harmonics,

909
00:52:21,161 --> 00:52:22,782
it was already really heavy in my mind.

910
00:52:25,354 --> 00:52:31,038
But another thing that probably has more influence on Harmonix is things that reset the cycle.

911
00:52:31,038 --> 00:52:37,324
So like the end of a turn in Magic. All of your cards untap, everything's reset, and

912
00:52:37,324 --> 00:52:40,967
it's under the player control, so it becomes a game mechanic in and of itself.

913
00:52:40,967 --> 00:52:41,727
Whereas dying in Bioshock is...

914
00:52:47,462 --> 00:52:51,482
not under the player's control and because you respawn in the

915
00:52:51,482 --> 00:52:55,823
Vita chamber um with all your health but not the ammo that

916
00:52:55,823 --> 00:52:58,744
you expended uh you get these weird kind of out of syncs

917
00:52:58,744 --> 00:53:00,964
between your the amount of health that you have and uh the

918
00:53:00,964 --> 00:53:05,725
amount of ammo that you have and kind of the state of the world

919
00:53:05,725 --> 00:53:08,806
and and and their harmonics kind of diverge. So um just to look

920
00:53:08,806 --> 00:53:09,846
take another look at kind of how harmonics work um.

921
00:53:19,442 --> 00:53:25,147
You know what, this is the last four slides and I don't think I'm going to make it, but basically

922
00:53:25,147 --> 00:53:33,295
the four games that I've been playing the most the last year, Super Meat Boy, Legendary, Halo,

923
00:53:33,295 --> 00:53:39,101
Dead Space and Dark Souls all have extremely similar harmonics, even though the mechanics are

924
00:53:39,101 --> 00:53:40,782
utterly different.

925
00:53:42,903 --> 00:53:47,945
I would encourage you to play all of those games with a mind toward how are these games

926
00:53:47,945 --> 00:53:55,528
the same and that will give you a little bit more insight into how mechanics will create

927
00:53:55,528 --> 00:54:05,352
the overall feel of your game. And we'll have just a very, very short time for questions.

928
00:54:27,039 --> 00:54:31,321
Yeah, you'll have to walk to one of the mics if you want to ask questions. Should I start

929
00:54:31,321 --> 00:54:46,508
calling on people? Sorry? Um, I'd rather talk about Dark Souls. I actually, uh, um, I, I

930
00:54:46,508 --> 00:54:51,291
put in like 120 hours on Dark Souls with no, uh, spoilers or hints and, um, I, I, I, I

931
00:54:52,752 --> 00:54:59,475
It is a masterpiece of game design because every decision that they make, because the

932
00:54:59,475 --> 00:55:03,157
stakes are so high, just impacts the player almost directly.

933
00:55:03,157 --> 00:55:08,120
So if you haven't played Dark Souls, I would strongly encourage that.

934
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:16,024
So I didn't really grasp from your slides.

935
00:55:17,510 --> 00:55:25,597
Specific examples of what harmonics are in a one or two sentence thing, could you expound a little bit?

936
00:55:25,597 --> 00:55:26,558
Yeah, um...

937
00:55:26,558 --> 00:55:36,647
So you constrain the player, right? And they have certain interactions that they can participate in, and those interactions sort of have a natural frequency.

938
00:55:37,242 --> 00:55:42,067
uh... uh... like the the shield recharging halo super example of of

939
00:55:42,067 --> 00:55:45,490
something that happens at a certain rate and it's a very predictable timing

940
00:55:45,490 --> 00:55:49,514
uh... what will happen is when you take all those different frequencies and you

941
00:55:49,514 --> 00:55:50,494
combine them

942
00:55:50,494 --> 00:55:54,919
they're either going to be in sync and be in in kind of a good

943
00:55:54,919 --> 00:55:55,739
in tune i suppose

944
00:55:55,739 --> 00:56:00,564
uh... or they're going to be at odds with each other and a lot of times games

945
00:56:00,564 --> 00:56:00,684
that

946
00:56:00,924 --> 00:56:05,128
feel solid and like well constructed,

947
00:56:05,128 --> 00:56:08,230
they have a lot of synchronicity between the harmonics.

948
00:56:08,230 --> 00:56:11,673
Whereas a game that feels off somehow,

949
00:56:11,673 --> 00:56:13,094
a lot of times what that means is that

950
00:56:13,094 --> 00:56:14,756
the frequencies are a little bit separate.

951
00:56:14,756 --> 00:56:18,499
What you're really saying is that good harmonics

952
00:56:18,499 --> 00:56:19,840
are games that are well balanced.

953
00:56:21,401 --> 00:56:25,083
No, no, balance, at least to me...

954
00:56:25,083 --> 00:56:27,745
Balanced in timing and system balance.

955
00:56:27,745 --> 00:56:30,447
Yeah, they have a good rhythm to them.

956
00:56:30,447 --> 00:56:37,472
Yeah, and when I first started I very much looked at game design as sort of an engineering problem.

957
00:56:37,472 --> 00:56:40,354
Like, come up with the right mechanics that will build the right system

958
00:56:40,354 --> 00:56:43,096
that will produce the right experience.

959
00:56:43,096 --> 00:56:45,698
And as I go on I see it more as a...

960
00:56:46,189 --> 00:56:48,571
almost composing, right?

961
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:53,376
Coming up with melodies that repeat

962
00:56:53,376 --> 00:56:58,601
and sort of a predictable flow across the game.

963
00:57:03,108 --> 00:57:07,610
So it's very clear that you have a very rigorous and analytical approach to games.

964
00:57:07,610 --> 00:57:12,431
What I'm interested to hear about is, I mean it's easy, oh not easy, but,

965
00:57:12,431 --> 00:57:16,413
so you're looking at games that have already been finished and analyzing the harmonics,

966
00:57:16,413 --> 00:57:18,453
how are these different mechanisms interacting with each other.

967
00:57:18,453 --> 00:57:19,914
Can you speak towards...

968
00:57:20,794 --> 00:57:26,139
looking at those mechanisms but from inception, so from creating a game, is there a way to

969
00:57:26,139 --> 00:57:32,945
anticipate or like how would you go about applying these same types of mechanics and

970
00:57:32,945 --> 00:57:36,768
mentalities to building a system that interacts well together?

971
00:57:36,768 --> 00:57:41,693
Yeah I think, um, uh, go listen to a really good trance song, right?

972
00:57:42,224 --> 00:57:48,370
They're going to start with a beat, and then they're going to layer on lots of different harmonies.

973
00:57:48,370 --> 00:57:50,092
Then at some point they're going to change it all up.

974
00:57:50,092 --> 00:57:52,535
And I think you can approach game design in sort of a similar way.

975
00:57:52,535 --> 00:57:56,580
You figure out what is the pace setter for your game,

976
00:57:56,580 --> 00:58:03,407
what are the things that are going to start a new, kind of familiar theme, and then...

977
00:58:04,655 --> 00:58:08,837
make sure that the timing for those are all going to line up.

978
00:58:08,837 --> 00:58:12,219
And that you don't have a game where everything

979
00:58:12,219 --> 00:58:14,280
happens at the same frequency, because then you're

980
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:16,381
going to get the same experience over and over.

981
00:58:16,381 --> 00:58:20,043
And use different frequencies that still line up

982
00:58:20,043 --> 00:58:23,565
to produce a lot of variety in the gameplay.

983
00:58:23,565 --> 00:58:27,007
And this is obviously something that I'm going into the future,

984
00:58:27,007 --> 00:58:28,648
I'm going to try to do a little bit more intentionally

985
00:58:28,648 --> 00:58:30,689
from the start, sort of retroactively.

986
00:58:34,442 --> 00:58:37,246
Okay, if there's no more questions, thanks for coming.

987
00:58:37,246 --> 00:58:39,109
Get to the airport, get on your planes,

988
00:58:39,109 --> 00:58:41,172
go back to all your various places.

989
00:58:41,172 --> 00:58:41,352
Thanks.
