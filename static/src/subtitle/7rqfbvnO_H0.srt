1
00:00:05,742 --> 00:00:07,382
My name is Anthony Giovannetti,

2
00:00:07,582 --> 00:00:10,123
and I am one of the two co-founders of Megacrit Games.

3
00:00:10,943 --> 00:00:12,984
Slay the Spire was our first professional game,

4
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:15,865
but in college I worked with my co-founder Casey Anno

5
00:00:16,065 --> 00:00:18,405
with on two smaller hobbyist level projects

6
00:00:18,865 --> 00:00:21,246
that taught us a lot about exactly what not to do.

7
00:00:22,546 --> 00:00:23,447
Importantly, you should know

8
00:00:23,467 --> 00:00:24,967
that I'm a huge fan of card games.

9
00:00:25,827 --> 00:00:28,128
I grew up playing with Pokemon cards and Magic the Gathering

10
00:00:28,668 --> 00:00:31,029
and later on I became so addicted to Netrunner

11
00:00:31,249 --> 00:00:33,010
that I created a large fan site for it.

12
00:00:33,808 --> 00:00:37,391
In fact, I even managed a board and card game shop for a while.

13
00:00:38,532 --> 00:00:39,753
So I really love card games.

14
00:00:40,233 --> 00:00:41,634
So of course, I decided to make one.

15
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,497
The game we ended up making is called Slay the Spire.

16
00:00:46,478 --> 00:00:48,700
For those of you who don't know, Slay the Spire

17
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,102
is a fusion of roguelikes and deck building games

18
00:00:51,602 --> 00:00:53,624
that has players traversing a dangerous spire

19
00:00:53,664 --> 00:00:54,385
to reach the top.

20
00:00:55,425 --> 00:00:57,107
Every time you play, you'll be climbing

21
00:00:57,167 --> 00:00:58,908
a new procedurally generated spire

22
00:00:59,449 --> 00:01:01,070
and assembling a unique deck of cards

23
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,251
from what you find during your run.

24
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:07,331
Throughout early access, we received overwhelmingly positive review scores,

25
00:01:07,952 --> 00:01:10,953
and quite frankly, we sold way more copies than I ever thought imaginable.

26
00:01:11,973 --> 00:01:14,994
In terms of development time, Slay this Bar was in development for two

27
00:01:15,014 --> 00:01:19,235
and a half years before we launched into early access, and then we were in early

28
00:01:19,335 --> 00:01:23,997
access for a little over a year before launching into 1.0 in January of this year.

29
00:01:26,873 --> 00:01:29,495
Today for this talk, I'm going to narrow down my focus

30
00:01:29,915 --> 00:01:32,316
and talk specifically about how we thought about balance

31
00:01:32,336 --> 00:01:34,597
for Slay the Spire, some of the important tools

32
00:01:34,637 --> 00:01:36,058
we used to help facilitate that,

33
00:01:36,578 --> 00:01:38,199
and just our general approach to design.

34
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,241
So, as you clearly do when you talk about game design,

35
00:01:43,502 --> 00:01:45,743
I'm going to start by looking at one of Picasso's

36
00:01:45,823 --> 00:01:46,883
most famous paintings.

37
00:01:48,404 --> 00:01:50,585
Now, I'm not much of a fine art person, to be honest,

38
00:01:50,845 --> 00:01:53,687
but this painting in particular has a few special properties

39
00:01:53,727 --> 00:01:54,767
that I think are really neat.

40
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:59,057
So for some context, this piece is incredibly famous.

41
00:01:59,517 --> 00:02:02,559
It's featured in something like 95% of art textbooks

42
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:05,520
that cover the 20th century, and no other piece comes close.

43
00:02:06,621 --> 00:02:09,423
But what really interests me about it is the process.

44
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,284
You see, Picasso spent about a year

45
00:02:12,404 --> 00:02:15,586
in the making of this piece, and more significantly,

46
00:02:15,606 --> 00:02:20,409
he has the known record with over 500 preparatory drawings

47
00:02:20,649 --> 00:02:21,669
just for this piece of art.

48
00:02:22,594 --> 00:02:25,555
Often I think of painting as something more spontaneous.

49
00:02:26,676 --> 00:02:29,297
Kind of like Bob Ross, where you're painting

50
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:31,618
happy little accidents right onto the canvas.

51
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:34,800
Conversely, this particular piece

52
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,761
was a work of constant iteration.

53
00:02:37,481 --> 00:02:40,943
After the 500th drawing, Picasso had narrowed down

54
00:02:41,043 --> 00:02:43,865
his masterpiece into exactly the final product

55
00:02:43,925 --> 00:02:44,745
that he knew he wanted.

56
00:02:45,546 --> 00:02:48,047
This process is how I think about game design.

57
00:02:48,667 --> 00:02:50,468
Iteration and testing are king.

58
00:02:52,754 --> 00:02:53,855
Okay, so this sounds great.

59
00:02:54,595 --> 00:02:56,958
It's common knowledge that playtesting is invaluable.

60
00:02:57,818 --> 00:02:59,720
So if we want to create a good iteration cycle,

61
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,202
how do we go about doing that,

62
00:03:01,762 --> 00:03:02,923
and are there any challenges,

63
00:03:02,943 --> 00:03:05,185
and in particular, as an indie, which I am?

64
00:03:06,226 --> 00:03:07,768
Well, I think a good way to start

65
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:10,110
is by thinking about exactly what your goals are.

66
00:03:10,811 --> 00:03:13,513
In this case, what do I mean by balance for Slay the Spire?

67
00:03:15,886 --> 00:03:19,288
By balance, what we mean is that every card

68
00:03:19,508 --> 00:03:20,429
should have its place.

69
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,671
And this extends to everything, not just cards,

70
00:03:23,751 --> 00:03:26,513
but the relics, the events, the monsters in the game.

71
00:03:26,613 --> 00:03:27,714
But I'm kind of simplifying here.

72
00:03:29,215 --> 00:03:31,917
Note that have a place is very different

73
00:03:31,997 --> 00:03:34,219
than everything should be equal to each other.

74
00:03:34,999 --> 00:03:38,301
So, for example, some cards can be build-around-me cards.

75
00:03:38,853 --> 00:03:41,394
These are cards that define strategies or archetypes.

76
00:03:41,915 --> 00:03:43,075
Just having that in your deck

77
00:03:43,295 --> 00:03:44,816
really changes the nature of your deck.

78
00:03:45,577 --> 00:03:47,898
Other cards can be staples that have a place

79
00:03:47,938 --> 00:03:49,019
in a lot of different decks,

80
00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:50,619
but maybe they don't stand out

81
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:51,820
in any one deck in particular.

82
00:03:52,801 --> 00:03:55,662
The important thing is that every card's doing something

83
00:03:55,962 --> 00:03:57,003
and that they're all reasonable

84
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:58,964
to take a certain percentage of the time.

85
00:03:59,905 --> 00:04:02,826
In this sense, I'm not striving for the impossible task

86
00:04:02,866 --> 00:04:04,667
of making every card equally good,

87
00:04:05,148 --> 00:04:07,569
but instead I'm shooting for a way more sensible target.

88
00:04:09,147 --> 00:04:11,107
Additionally, I wanted to avoid content

89
00:04:11,147 --> 00:04:13,188
that had what I call a warping effect.

90
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:16,909
If something is too powerful and also too easy to set up,

91
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,850
then the game can easily become

92
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,831
just about achieving that combo or strategy.

93
00:04:21,531 --> 00:04:23,952
What we're striving for, ultimately with Slay the Spire,

94
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:26,553
is a diversity of strategies and play styles,

95
00:04:27,073 --> 00:04:29,654
so it is important to limit the overpowered effects

96
00:04:29,714 --> 00:04:30,394
in some fashion.

97
00:04:33,396 --> 00:04:35,696
With Slay the Spire, we actually had two main advantages.

98
00:04:36,417 --> 00:04:37,697
One, we're a single-player game.

99
00:04:38,307 --> 00:04:39,407
And two, we're a roguelike.

100
00:04:40,788 --> 00:04:42,389
Due to the nature of being a single player

101
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:45,391
roguelike experience, I don't need to worry as much

102
00:04:45,472 --> 00:04:48,273
like Hearthstone or Magic about a single dominant strategy

103
00:04:48,794 --> 00:04:50,755
because you won't always get the required cards

104
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,896
or relics to pull it off.

105
00:04:52,837 --> 00:04:55,318
Even if you do pull it off, you're just gonna be

106
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,720
dominating the game itself and not another player

107
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,781
who's gonna have a bad time.

108
00:04:59,721 --> 00:05:02,443
As long as anything too overpowered is rare

109
00:05:02,483 --> 00:05:04,404
and difficult to pull off, the game is still

110
00:05:04,424 --> 00:05:05,445
gonna function correctly.

111
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:09,639
As an example of this, players of Slay the Spire

112
00:05:09,659 --> 00:05:11,460
might recognize the combo on the screen

113
00:05:12,121 --> 00:05:14,463
of the card Corruption and the relic Dead Branch.

114
00:05:15,805 --> 00:05:18,567
Dead Branch is an incredibly powerful rare relic

115
00:05:19,008 --> 00:05:21,490
that generates new cards whenever a card is exhausted.

116
00:05:22,391 --> 00:05:25,614
Corruption makes exhausting cards really, really easy to do.

117
00:05:26,335 --> 00:05:28,617
So in tandem, they create a ton of value together,

118
00:05:28,897 --> 00:05:30,979
and this is probably one of the more powerful combos

119
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:31,360
in the game.

120
00:05:32,371 --> 00:05:34,672
However, since we're not a traditional card game

121
00:05:34,692 --> 00:05:35,652
like Hearthstone or Magic,

122
00:05:36,392 --> 00:05:38,413
you can't just always put this combo into your deck

123
00:05:38,593 --> 00:05:40,874
and consistently play the same thing over and over again.

124
00:05:41,714 --> 00:05:44,535
And so the Spire, not only will you often not see

125
00:05:45,396 --> 00:05:46,396
one or even both of these,

126
00:05:46,976 --> 00:05:48,857
but maybe in a run you saw Corruption early,

127
00:05:49,117 --> 00:05:50,818
thought, hey, this doesn't match my deck,

128
00:05:51,258 --> 00:05:51,818
I don't want it.

129
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:53,959
Later on in the run, you see Dead Branch.

130
00:05:54,459 --> 00:05:56,180
Because you didn't take that earlier Corruption,

131
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,520
it's not as impactful.

132
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,209
Because this is rare and often the player

133
00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:02,830
has to kind of actively seek it out,

134
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:04,951
it's okay when they do assemble it

135
00:06:05,171 --> 00:06:06,813
and we're comfortable rewarding the player

136
00:06:07,013 --> 00:06:09,334
with a feeling of extreme power when they do pull it off.

137
00:06:10,055 --> 00:06:12,156
So this is a really big advantage that we have.

138
00:06:13,337 --> 00:06:16,439
But even with this in mind, we need to recognize

139
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,380
that we had one big downside in particular.

140
00:06:19,681 --> 00:06:22,543
Namely, we're a small indie team of two people,

141
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:26,346
two designers, and we're trying to balance

142
00:06:26,446 --> 00:06:28,147
hundreds of cards and other content together.

143
00:06:28,841 --> 00:06:31,143
especially when you start to get the crazy interactions

144
00:06:31,223 --> 00:06:34,225
between relics and cards acting in tandem,

145
00:06:34,665 --> 00:06:37,027
it can quickly balloon into a near endless task.

146
00:06:38,028 --> 00:06:40,010
As a long time card game player myself,

147
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:43,392
I knew that even large, experienced design teams

148
00:06:43,772 --> 00:06:46,294
working on established games with lots of resources

149
00:06:47,015 --> 00:06:48,196
mess up balance all the time.

150
00:06:48,856 --> 00:06:51,378
So for us, balance was gonna have to be something

151
00:06:51,398 --> 00:06:53,700
that we worked on at an early stage

152
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,061
and actually tried to scale up.

153
00:06:56,042 --> 00:06:56,963
So what tools do we use?

154
00:06:57,907 --> 00:07:00,248
Well, of course, we used the traditional methods.

155
00:07:00,868 --> 00:07:03,049
We watched players play the game, went to events,

156
00:07:03,769 --> 00:07:06,170
played an unhealthy amount of the game ourselves.

157
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:08,371
We started internal playtest groups,

158
00:07:09,371 --> 00:07:12,132
but we also made a concerted effort early on

159
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:15,693
to expand our playtest reach and ability to gather feedback.

160
00:07:16,574 --> 00:07:19,075
To this end, we made use of a few specific tools

161
00:07:19,495 --> 00:07:20,895
to greatly amplify our efforts.

162
00:07:21,736 --> 00:07:22,676
So let's go into those.

163
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,081
The first tool that we started using

164
00:07:31,781 --> 00:07:33,302
was an internal playtester slack

165
00:07:33,682 --> 00:07:35,663
that all the playtesters would use to communicate,

166
00:07:36,264 --> 00:07:37,564
get new game builds, et cetera.

167
00:07:38,665 --> 00:07:41,187
We wanted to make things as easy as possible

168
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:42,607
for the playtesters and us.

169
00:07:43,248 --> 00:07:45,529
So we used a bot to collect all of the feedback,

170
00:07:45,709 --> 00:07:48,331
the bug reports, the ideas, or anything else

171
00:07:48,591 --> 00:07:50,352
into one easy place that we could look through.

172
00:07:51,258 --> 00:07:52,759
I always hated filling out surveys.

173
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:55,039
I would playtest games for other people

174
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,800
and fill out their surveys and not really like it.

175
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,940
So I didn't want to do anything like that.

176
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,941
So instead we focused on making the barrier

177
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:04,141
to give feedback as low as possible.

178
00:08:04,822 --> 00:08:07,322
As a result, playtesters could give as much feedback

179
00:08:07,382 --> 00:08:09,023
as they wanted at any time,

180
00:08:09,163 --> 00:08:10,463
whenever it was convenient for them,

181
00:08:11,003 --> 00:08:12,583
and it didn't feel like a burden.

182
00:08:14,351 --> 00:08:15,972
Then we used my strong connections

183
00:08:16,012 --> 00:08:17,073
with the Netrunner community

184
00:08:17,353 --> 00:08:19,335
to invite some of the top level Netrunner players

185
00:08:19,595 --> 00:08:21,077
to provide high quality feedback

186
00:08:21,517 --> 00:08:22,958
and we encouraged them to break the game

187
00:08:23,359 --> 00:08:25,080
even when a lot of the systems weren't in place.

188
00:08:26,641 --> 00:08:28,623
One of the reasons that this was sustainable for us

189
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,745
is that basically every single day

190
00:08:31,165 --> 00:08:33,067
we were pushing out a new build of Slay the Spire

191
00:08:33,527 --> 00:08:35,889
with a changelog into a Slack channel

192
00:08:36,009 --> 00:08:37,571
that our play testers had access to.

193
00:08:38,536 --> 00:08:41,278
The constant stream of new content, balance changes,

194
00:08:41,678 --> 00:08:44,520
and system overhauls meant that instead of testing

195
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,901
something that got stale, there was a constant

196
00:08:46,921 --> 00:08:49,402
growing experience that people could keep coming back to.

197
00:08:50,243 --> 00:08:52,084
We actually had individual playtesters

198
00:08:52,544 --> 00:08:54,726
who played thousands of runs just because

199
00:08:54,746 --> 00:08:56,787
their interest level was genuinely kept

200
00:08:56,807 --> 00:08:58,488
throughout the two and a half years of development.

201
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:02,831
The second tool we started using

202
00:09:03,031 --> 00:09:04,592
was absolutely integral for us

203
00:09:04,972 --> 00:09:06,293
throughout the life cycle of the game.

204
00:09:07,517 --> 00:09:10,059
As a data-driven person, I wanted the ability

205
00:09:10,119 --> 00:09:12,521
to really try and test our assumptions regarding balance.

206
00:09:13,241 --> 00:09:15,363
To that end, we built an in-house metric server

207
00:09:15,844 --> 00:09:17,165
that collects data from the players

208
00:09:17,205 --> 00:09:18,125
whenever they play a run.

209
00:09:19,567 --> 00:09:22,489
On death or victory, anonymous data is sent back to us

210
00:09:22,669 --> 00:09:23,770
and collected for analysis.

211
00:09:24,951 --> 00:09:27,033
We collect data on basically every single piece

212
00:09:27,053 --> 00:09:28,594
of relevant information we could think of.

213
00:09:29,114 --> 00:09:32,077
We look at the enemies, the cards, the relics, the events,

214
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,179
what choices the player's making at meow at the beginning.

215
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,294
how long it takes them to complete a run, et cetera.

216
00:09:39,255 --> 00:09:41,536
This was incredibly useful prior to launching

217
00:09:41,576 --> 00:09:44,398
at early access, as it meant that even the quiet players

218
00:09:44,739 --> 00:09:46,740
that just played new builds and only rarely,

219
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,021
if ever, gave feedback, they were still contributing.

220
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:50,943
Their data was still useful,

221
00:09:51,143 --> 00:09:53,164
even if they weren't giving any feedback.

222
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:56,126
And every single run done prior to launch had merit.

223
00:09:58,888 --> 00:10:01,650
You can think of this as passive versus active playtesting.

224
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,852
Going out to events or using focus groups

225
00:10:04,912 --> 00:10:06,833
and watching people play, it's super valuable,

226
00:10:07,053 --> 00:10:09,354
and we did it, but it's very active.

227
00:10:09,854 --> 00:10:12,016
It takes a lot of time, it doesn't scale very well,

228
00:10:12,296 --> 00:10:14,317
and it takes resources that we just didn't have.

229
00:10:15,217 --> 00:10:17,339
Our metric server, on the other hand, is very passive.

230
00:10:17,719 --> 00:10:19,440
Just collects data for us in the background,

231
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,541
and then we can look at it to answer questions

232
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:23,682
or generate ideas whenever we're able to.

233
00:10:25,003 --> 00:10:27,404
This comboed very well with our internal Slack

234
00:10:27,825 --> 00:10:29,626
by allowing us to fully leverage

235
00:10:29,706 --> 00:10:31,246
the contribution of each play tester.

236
00:10:33,168 --> 00:10:36,069
For us, using metrics was a completely invaluable tool

237
00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:38,350
in our toolbox, and it actually allowed us

238
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:40,311
to be more objective in our decision making,

239
00:10:40,752 --> 00:10:41,312
even early on.

240
00:10:44,794 --> 00:10:48,395
However, with all that said, as a note of caution,

241
00:10:48,695 --> 00:10:50,316
it's important to remember that metrics

242
00:10:50,536 --> 00:10:52,357
are just one tool in your designer's toolbox,

243
00:10:52,697 --> 00:10:54,498
and they should be used in tandem with other things.

244
00:10:55,385 --> 00:10:58,147
Sometimes other factors can cause the data to lie to you.

245
00:10:58,167 --> 00:11:00,708
A great example of this in Slay the Spire

246
00:11:00,748 --> 00:11:01,709
was the card Madness.

247
00:11:02,709 --> 00:11:04,691
Now Madness is a good card, don't get me wrong,

248
00:11:05,071 --> 00:11:08,153
but one thing that we were seeing in our data early on

249
00:11:08,513 --> 00:11:11,195
was that Madness had a grossly disproportionate rate

250
00:11:11,235 --> 00:11:12,576
of being seen in winning decks.

251
00:11:13,316 --> 00:11:14,137
Why was this the case?

252
00:11:14,477 --> 00:11:16,839
Was Madness actually one of the better cards in the game?

253
00:11:18,199 --> 00:11:18,540
Well, no.

254
00:11:19,085 --> 00:11:21,486
The problem is that most players that had madness

255
00:11:21,526 --> 00:11:23,868
in their deck were getting it at an event

256
00:11:23,948 --> 00:11:25,849
that happened late in the third act of the game,

257
00:11:25,949 --> 00:11:26,669
before the boss.

258
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,051
So this was artificially inflating

259
00:11:30,091 --> 00:11:31,472
the apparent power level of the card.

260
00:11:32,353 --> 00:11:34,174
So data is incredibly useful,

261
00:11:34,514 --> 00:11:37,135
but it can lie to you, deceive you,

262
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:39,357
and it needs to be thought about before you act on it.

263
00:11:39,617 --> 00:11:42,018
It's up to you, the designer, to figure out the truth

264
00:11:42,098 --> 00:11:43,319
about what your data's telling you.

265
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,181
Another cautionary tale we had.

266
00:11:46,551 --> 00:11:47,812
that we discovered very early on

267
00:11:47,912 --> 00:11:49,352
when we didn't have a lot of playtesters

268
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:53,054
was that we had two of what I'll call super playtesters,

269
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:56,196
people who were already obsessed with the game,

270
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,638
playing unhealthy amounts of it. And this is great.

271
00:11:59,658 --> 00:12:02,079
You know, you're always happy to see early playtesters

272
00:12:02,119 --> 00:12:02,839
that love your game,

273
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,720
especially when it just has stick figure art.

274
00:12:06,181 --> 00:12:08,262
And it's great because we're getting a lot of run data

275
00:12:08,322 --> 00:12:10,964
on them, but it also meant that if we just looked

276
00:12:11,004 --> 00:12:12,324
at all of the data in aggregate

277
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:14,265
and just took lined averages of things,

278
00:12:15,082 --> 00:12:17,064
We're basically just sampling those two people.

279
00:12:17,124 --> 00:12:18,645
They were dwarfing the other players

280
00:12:18,725 --> 00:12:20,147
who were maybe less experienced,

281
00:12:20,567 --> 00:12:21,708
only played every now and then.

282
00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:24,751
These are the kind of things that need to be accounted for

283
00:12:24,771 --> 00:12:26,632
when you're collecting metrics.

284
00:12:28,074 --> 00:12:30,676
So, with those tools in mind,

285
00:12:31,176 --> 00:12:33,418
we launched into early access with two and a half years

286
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:35,560
of development, refinement, and balance testing.

287
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:39,097
This is hugely important as we launched

288
00:12:39,137 --> 00:12:41,237
with what was already a very balanced product.

289
00:12:41,937 --> 00:12:44,558
I see many titles that launch into early access

290
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:47,739
that are quite simply unbalanced, buggy messes

291
00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:48,379
at that stage.

292
00:12:48,859 --> 00:12:50,200
I don't think that really works very well.

293
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,020
And it's where early access gets a lot of its bad rep from.

294
00:12:53,961 --> 00:12:56,601
Our approach instead was to launch an already balanced

295
00:12:56,721 --> 00:12:58,262
and near complete game into early access

296
00:12:58,622 --> 00:13:00,822
and then just keep expanding it frequently

297
00:13:01,383 --> 00:13:02,263
with more and more content.

298
00:13:03,929 --> 00:13:06,170
So, launching into early access was a real game changer

299
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:06,950
for Slay the Spire.

300
00:13:08,031 --> 00:13:10,372
It greatly improved how valuable our metric collection was.

301
00:13:11,052 --> 00:13:12,993
As the player base our metrics was pulling data from

302
00:13:13,033 --> 00:13:15,854
became way larger, it allowed us to see new patterns

303
00:13:15,874 --> 00:13:17,955
that we may have missed for various reasons before.

304
00:13:19,056 --> 00:13:20,636
We were also getting a wider skill range

305
00:13:20,676 --> 00:13:22,977
in our player base, meaning that we could better

306
00:13:23,597 --> 00:13:25,638
get data on the less experienced card game players,

307
00:13:25,998 --> 00:13:27,179
or just people that didn't play very much.

308
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:32,372
Our release cycle during early access was also noteworthy

309
00:13:32,732 --> 00:13:34,833
and was influenced by our prior development cycle.

310
00:13:35,693 --> 00:13:37,954
One thing that we had really learned as a takeaway

311
00:13:38,114 --> 00:13:39,335
from our internal play testing

312
00:13:39,675 --> 00:13:42,076
was that players love constant balance tweaks

313
00:13:42,136 --> 00:13:43,076
and changes to the game.

314
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:47,318
Since we saw that constant engagement from our play testers

315
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:48,598
with our quick release cycle,

316
00:13:49,179 --> 00:13:51,720
we decided to do a weekly update schedule in early access.

317
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:55,849
The weekly updates were beloved throughout Early Access,

318
00:13:56,289 --> 00:13:58,591
and they established that things were subject to change

319
00:13:58,811 --> 00:14:00,692
at any moment one week from the next.

320
00:14:01,893 --> 00:14:04,114
This meant that the expectations of our players

321
00:14:04,535 --> 00:14:07,817
were totally in line with our desire to constantly iterate

322
00:14:07,917 --> 00:14:09,078
and tweak the balance of the game.

323
00:14:10,719 --> 00:14:13,160
Additionally, we had some great new tools available to us,

324
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:17,383
namely Discord, our new Ascension levels, and streamers.

325
00:14:17,943 --> 00:14:18,924
So we're gonna talk about those now.

326
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:23,066
Discord was set up to be much like

327
00:14:23,126 --> 00:14:24,507
our internal playtesting Slack,

328
00:14:24,787 --> 00:14:27,088
except orders of magnitude larger.

329
00:14:28,349 --> 00:14:30,811
To better receive feedback from the thousands of new voices,

330
00:14:31,311 --> 00:14:34,513
we brought back FeedbackBot from our Slack into our Discord

331
00:14:34,933 --> 00:14:36,354
so it could easily collect feedback

332
00:14:36,394 --> 00:14:37,814
from the growing player community.

333
00:14:38,655 --> 00:14:39,916
The Discord continued to grow

334
00:14:40,156 --> 00:14:42,077
and had a large number of people providing us

335
00:14:42,117 --> 00:14:43,698
with a never-ending stream of feedback.

336
00:14:44,794 --> 00:14:46,815
In fact, at the time that I made this slide,

337
00:14:46,835 --> 00:14:49,956
it collected over 18,000 pieces of feedback for us.

338
00:14:50,376 --> 00:14:52,297
And keep in mind, we basically read

339
00:14:52,417 --> 00:14:54,077
every single piece of feedback on there.

340
00:14:54,097 --> 00:14:55,118
This was a lot.

341
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,579
We also created a beta branch that was accessible

342
00:14:58,639 --> 00:14:59,760
to players in early access.

343
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:01,780
Players on the beta branch.

344
00:15:02,154 --> 00:15:04,036
We're getting essentially daily builds,

345
00:15:04,176 --> 00:15:05,857
just like our old Slack play testers were.

346
00:15:06,658 --> 00:15:08,059
Even though these builds were buggier

347
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,360
and often less balanced,

348
00:15:09,961 --> 00:15:11,342
because of how it was framed

349
00:15:11,502 --> 00:15:13,044
and the expectations that were set,

350
00:15:13,644 --> 00:15:15,666
we were able to keep up our fast iterations

351
00:15:15,906 --> 00:15:17,427
while having an almost layered approach.

352
00:15:18,108 --> 00:15:20,350
Changes would get tested daily in the beta branch

353
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,492
before moving to the main branch every week.

354
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:24,474
The beta branch was a big hit,

355
00:15:24,654 --> 00:15:25,675
and it let players decide

356
00:15:25,735 --> 00:15:27,256
on how raw of an experience they wanted.

357
00:15:27,646 --> 00:15:29,307
Do they want to be right on the cutting edge,

358
00:15:29,407 --> 00:15:30,288
getting the new stuff,

359
00:15:30,528 --> 00:15:32,369
even if it meant a couple extra bugs?

360
00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:34,590
If so, great, provide us with feedback.

361
00:15:36,131 --> 00:15:38,232
Because we had these two different groupings of players,

362
00:15:38,512 --> 00:15:39,813
beta branch versus main branch,

363
00:15:40,354 --> 00:15:43,555
we created separate beta branch channels in our Discord

364
00:15:43,936 --> 00:15:45,977
to keep our beta players focused on feedback

365
00:15:46,037 --> 00:15:48,138
without spoiling other players of upcoming changes.

366
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,282
Additionally, one of the things that we developed

367
00:15:54,322 --> 00:15:56,783
in early access was ascension levels.

368
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,121
One challenge with balance is always how to handle

369
00:16:00,181 --> 00:16:01,262
differing difficulty modes.

370
00:16:02,443 --> 00:16:04,164
We primarily balance Slay the Spire

371
00:16:04,184 --> 00:16:05,885
around the base difficulty level,

372
00:16:06,685 --> 00:16:10,408
but Slay also has 20 levels of progressively harder

373
00:16:10,448 --> 00:16:12,509
difficulty that we call Ascension.

374
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,091
Players have to unlock these one level at a time,

375
00:16:16,672 --> 00:16:18,913
meaning that as player skill improves,

376
00:16:19,514 --> 00:16:21,315
so too will they climb up the Ascension ladder.

377
00:16:22,435 --> 00:16:24,197
Because playing Ascension is optional,

378
00:16:24,756 --> 00:16:27,859
but it offers achievements and a sense of accomplishment,

379
00:16:28,599 --> 00:16:31,441
players will naturally gravitate to the ascension level

380
00:16:31,481 --> 00:16:32,362
that makes sense for them.

381
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:36,305
As a result, we can actually sort our metric data

382
00:16:36,445 --> 00:16:38,907
by ascension levels to get a better feel

383
00:16:38,927 --> 00:16:40,248
for granularity in our data.

384
00:16:40,849 --> 00:16:42,450
And it also makes targeted changes

385
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,131
for more or less hardcore players.

386
00:16:45,579 --> 00:16:47,301
Consequently, what we did is we actually turned

387
00:16:47,461 --> 00:16:50,043
difficulty levels from a challenge in design

388
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:53,006
into a strength, not just in terms of metrics

389
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:55,648
and data collection, but also in terms of our ability

390
00:16:55,688 --> 00:16:57,169
to balance for different kind of players.

391
00:16:58,731 --> 00:17:00,432
Furthermore, our custom and daily modes

392
00:17:01,133 --> 00:17:03,395
also added additional ways to alter the difficulty

393
00:17:03,415 --> 00:17:05,476
of the game with unique modifiers

394
00:17:05,577 --> 00:17:08,199
that greatly change up play, usually to make things

395
00:17:08,259 --> 00:17:09,400
actually easier this time around.

396
00:17:10,094 --> 00:17:12,397
Again, this gives further customization

397
00:17:12,477 --> 00:17:15,801
outside of the typical easy, medium, hard paradigm.

398
00:17:16,682 --> 00:17:18,685
I really highly recommend experimenting

399
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:21,108
with systems like this, as the Ascension levels

400
00:17:21,148 --> 00:17:22,549
turned out to be a big hit.

401
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:25,073
And in fact, streamers in particular really like them.

402
00:17:26,895 --> 00:17:28,617
So, let's talk about streamers and YouTubers.

403
00:17:30,864 --> 00:17:32,706
Streamers are incredibly valuable.

404
00:17:33,246 --> 00:17:34,507
I don't think anyone questions that.

405
00:17:35,207 --> 00:17:37,649
And they're not just great at promoting your game to others,

406
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:41,092
but maybe surprisingly, they're also amazing

407
00:17:41,152 --> 00:17:42,773
for keeping up to date with the community

408
00:17:42,893 --> 00:17:44,194
and getting feedback about your game.

409
00:17:45,515 --> 00:17:47,957
During early access, I would just often watch

410
00:17:48,017 --> 00:17:50,199
various streamers on an additional monitor

411
00:17:50,339 --> 00:17:51,120
while I was working.

412
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,482
This let me directly listen to what the popular voices

413
00:17:54,522 --> 00:17:58,205
in the community felt about various cards or enemies.

414
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:02,159
So, broad data's great, and sometimes just getting

415
00:18:02,199 --> 00:18:05,121
that strong, visceral response is actually more useful.

416
00:18:06,282 --> 00:18:08,484
This acted as a good replacement for going to events

417
00:18:08,704 --> 00:18:10,706
or trying to get people to sit down in the same room as me.

418
00:18:11,066 --> 00:18:13,348
I just didn't have time for it anymore in early access.

419
00:18:14,248 --> 00:18:16,010
When you hear that dejected streamer

420
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:19,692
making yet another sad meme about some item in the game,

421
00:18:19,772 --> 00:18:20,753
it's actually really telling.

422
00:18:21,414 --> 00:18:24,076
It can help actually place an experience

423
00:18:24,156 --> 00:18:25,197
to the data that you're seeing.

424
00:18:26,903 --> 00:18:29,484
Additionally, streamers are always talking to their audience,

425
00:18:29,945 --> 00:18:32,046
so you're getting their internal thoughts constantly.

426
00:18:32,566 --> 00:18:35,027
This is very hard to pick up from random people

427
00:18:35,067 --> 00:18:36,228
at an event or a focus group.

428
00:18:37,009 --> 00:18:38,369
Regular people aren't used to talking

429
00:18:38,389 --> 00:18:39,650
their thoughts out loud like that.

430
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:43,172
I've often found that you get better insight from a streamer

431
00:18:43,412 --> 00:18:45,053
than you do from just in-person watching,

432
00:18:45,774 --> 00:18:47,274
as a streamer is not gonna be afraid

433
00:18:47,314 --> 00:18:48,875
to say their mind or insult you.

434
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:50,396
They don't even know you're there half the time.

435
00:18:51,257 --> 00:18:53,598
And you even get to see what Twitch chat thinks about stuff,

436
00:18:53,638 --> 00:18:54,679
and yeah, that's bad,

437
00:18:54,739 --> 00:18:56,460
but sometimes you get some good stuff out of it too.

438
00:18:58,293 --> 00:19:01,215
So streamers are really, really great,

439
00:19:01,675 --> 00:19:03,796
and you should probably watch streams of your game.

440
00:19:06,156 --> 00:19:07,897
Okay, so now we have all these great means

441
00:19:07,937 --> 00:19:09,618
of collecting player feedback and data.

442
00:19:10,278 --> 00:19:12,559
The tricky thing is how to holistically combine it

443
00:19:12,579 --> 00:19:15,140
all together into a coherent, balanced whole.

444
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,201
This is where the early access model is so helpful,

445
00:19:18,801 --> 00:19:20,562
because you can always respond to the data,

446
00:19:21,082 --> 00:19:23,583
make a change, and then see how it affects the player base.

447
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:26,584
With that in mind, I really want to emphasize something.

448
00:19:28,024 --> 00:19:30,265
Do not be afraid to break things.

449
00:19:31,085 --> 00:19:33,626
As an example, when we launched our new daily mode,

450
00:19:34,066 --> 00:19:36,207
players were initially happy to have a new mode,

451
00:19:36,527 --> 00:19:37,688
new content, always good,

452
00:19:38,528 --> 00:19:40,869
but it was quickly becoming clear to Casey and I

453
00:19:41,309 --> 00:19:42,589
that the mode had a few flaws

454
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:45,090
and it was probably not gonna be very popular for very long.

455
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,467
So we simply went back to the drawing board,

456
00:19:47,888 --> 00:19:49,588
and the very next weekly patch,

457
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:51,569
we had completely changed the mode,

458
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:54,171
made it more about these strange, weird modifiers

459
00:19:54,211 --> 00:19:55,131
that change your game up,

460
00:19:55,511 --> 00:19:57,472
instead of the original focus of trying to

461
00:19:57,932 --> 00:20:00,574
add an extra difficulty mode and compete with other players.

462
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:02,875
We already had ascension levels for things like that.

463
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:06,857
Now the daily mode was becoming increasingly popular,

464
00:20:06,877 --> 00:20:08,978
and it was a huge hit as we built upon it.

465
00:20:10,144 --> 00:20:12,006
If we had been overly cautious instead,

466
00:20:12,386 --> 00:20:14,708
we probably would not have taken the path we did.

467
00:20:15,228 --> 00:20:16,429
But because we had the freedom

468
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:18,191
to constantly change and iterate,

469
00:20:18,571 --> 00:20:20,193
we could swiftly act to improve the game.

470
00:20:21,294 --> 00:20:23,375
Because we were so directly tied into our players

471
00:20:23,395 --> 00:20:26,238
and what they wanted between the Discord,

472
00:20:26,278 --> 00:20:28,179
the metric server, reading Reddit

473
00:20:28,219 --> 00:20:29,861
and other social media, et cetera,

474
00:20:30,341 --> 00:20:32,763
I could already tell what was desired by the player base.

475
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,648
So, our approach paid off here.

476
00:20:36,509 --> 00:20:39,170
Our iterative heavy approach also started to pay dividends

477
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:41,811
when we began working on our third character, the defect.

478
00:20:43,971 --> 00:20:45,352
The defect was our third character,

479
00:20:45,852 --> 00:20:47,573
and the only one developed in early access.

480
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:49,893
And we thought that the defect was gonna take

481
00:20:49,973 --> 00:20:51,614
significantly longer than the other two.

482
00:20:52,234 --> 00:20:53,735
After all, we were busy working on

483
00:20:53,755 --> 00:20:55,375
a thousand other things at the time.

484
00:20:55,816 --> 00:20:57,916
We had to constantly push out those weekly patches.

485
00:20:59,117 --> 00:21:00,317
But surprisingly for us,

486
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:03,335
Because we had already designed two characters at this point

487
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,917
and also we had set up these improved streams

488
00:21:05,957 --> 00:21:07,838
of getting player feedback and metric data,

489
00:21:08,378 --> 00:21:10,560
the defect was actually the quickest character to develop.

490
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,602
We felt no hesitation at all at completely reworking cards

491
00:21:14,682 --> 00:21:15,923
from one day to the next day.

492
00:21:16,564 --> 00:21:19,545
And in fact, then pushing it out into our beta branch.

493
00:21:20,326 --> 00:21:23,208
We were able to hone in with great speed on something

494
00:21:23,228 --> 00:21:25,049
that we felt was very fleshed out

495
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:26,690
and played completely differently

496
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,791
to the other two characters.

497
00:21:28,795 --> 00:21:30,937
This also really encouraged people to play

498
00:21:31,377 --> 00:21:33,779
and streamers to log in and stream the defect

499
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:35,760
because every day cards were changing

500
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,702
so their viewers were constantly engaged.

501
00:21:38,743 --> 00:21:41,665
Overall, balancing the defect live in early access

502
00:21:41,965 --> 00:21:43,526
was a completely great experience

503
00:21:43,966 --> 00:21:46,268
and it was a huge success for our approach.

504
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:52,332
Okay, so in conclusion, here's some of the takeaways

505
00:21:52,372 --> 00:21:54,034
we had from developing SlaySpire.

506
00:21:55,615 --> 00:21:57,937
One, iterate, iterate, iterate,

507
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:00,294
Without change and experimentation,

508
00:22:00,334 --> 00:22:02,096
you aren't gonna narrow in on the good stuff.

509
00:22:03,157 --> 00:22:05,358
Two, don't be afraid to make changes.

510
00:22:07,821 --> 00:22:11,324
In the worst case, you're only gonna get more information

511
00:22:11,344 --> 00:22:14,026
to act on later, and ultimately,

512
00:22:14,086 --> 00:22:15,107
change is just gonna help you.

513
00:22:15,828 --> 00:22:17,929
Three, lower the barrier between yourself,

514
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,851
your playtesters, and your audience

515
00:22:19,951 --> 00:22:21,612
to get the best feedback possible

516
00:22:22,153 --> 00:22:24,435
and to get the highest quality of data.

517
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:27,342
And finally, update more often.

518
00:22:27,502 --> 00:22:28,764
Your players are gonna love you for it,

519
00:22:29,324 --> 00:22:31,087
and you're gonna make your game better as a result.

520
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:34,671
Okay, so that was my talk.

521
00:22:36,414 --> 00:22:37,195
Hopefully you enjoyed it,

522
00:22:37,535 --> 00:22:38,777
and now we have some time for Q&A.

523
00:22:39,438 --> 00:22:39,658
Thanks.

524
00:22:55,508 --> 00:23:00,333
Hi, so you had mentioned earlier about how

525
00:23:00,493 --> 00:23:06,679
Developing the game was a little easier in playtesting because as a game that is non-competitive that is single-player

526
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:13,425
It's kind of more okay for certain powers to be a bit overpowered in certain situations and all that I was wondering like

527
00:23:14,246 --> 00:23:18,929
How did you make a decision between certain abilities being overpowered in a cool way

528
00:23:19,229 --> 00:23:23,352
later in the game or which abilities would be considered degenerate and which things

529
00:23:23,372 --> 00:23:27,034
would need to be reeled back from being too strong since you didn't have to worry about

530
00:23:27,054 --> 00:23:29,456
a negative play experience for an opponent?

531
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:35,354
Sure. So a big part of it is how common it is to get that overpowered thing.

532
00:23:35,674 --> 00:23:39,076
It's like if we just had a common card that was way too powerful

533
00:23:39,156 --> 00:23:42,098
and you just saw it in every run, that's clearly no good.

534
00:23:42,258 --> 00:23:44,260
So one, you need things to be rare or hard to get.

535
00:23:45,661 --> 00:23:47,842
And then the other thing is just seeing how people play with it.

536
00:23:47,982 --> 00:23:49,544
So in general...

537
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:53,761
that's a bit harder to get straight from metrics.

538
00:23:53,781 --> 00:23:55,442
You would need that more from like feedback,

539
00:23:56,203 --> 00:23:58,164
like people posting things in a feedback bot

540
00:23:59,445 --> 00:24:00,286
or watching a streamer.

541
00:24:00,867 --> 00:24:05,190
But strategies that are very, very slow and grindy,

542
00:24:06,171 --> 00:24:06,311
like

543
00:24:07,082 --> 00:24:10,123
For example, if we allowed players to just keep healing up

544
00:24:10,384 --> 00:24:11,384
over and over and over again,

545
00:24:11,404 --> 00:24:13,685
and in fact we actually had this for a while,

546
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:15,406
you could like farm up healing powers

547
00:24:15,466 --> 00:24:16,247
and just keep playing them.

548
00:24:16,587 --> 00:24:18,588
It takes a long time to do, it's optimal,

549
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:20,249
but it's really, really boring.

550
00:24:20,589 --> 00:24:21,410
Those are the kind of things

551
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:22,871
that we wanted to nuke the hardest.

552
00:24:23,511 --> 00:24:24,592
Instead of something where you see

553
00:24:24,632 --> 00:24:26,333
like a really big number on the screen,

554
00:24:26,373 --> 00:24:28,554
you feel really powerful, those are feel good

555
00:24:28,594 --> 00:24:29,915
and that's what we wanted to encourage.

556
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:30,815
Thanks.

557
00:24:34,872 --> 00:24:38,476
I was wondering if you could comment on how you settled on your early access price, what

558
00:24:38,496 --> 00:24:40,898
kind of research you did and what factors played into that.

559
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:44,001
Sure, so how did we settle our early access price?

560
00:24:45,043 --> 00:24:49,808
We looked to other games and we said, hey, Dead Cells is selling for $16.99.

561
00:24:50,108 --> 00:24:51,029
They're kicking ass.

562
00:24:51,049 --> 00:24:51,750
They're doing great.

563
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,372
These guys seem really smart.

564
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:56,515
And then we looked at other stuff and honestly that's how we did it.

565
00:24:59,544 --> 00:25:00,445
You have two questions.

566
00:25:00,725 --> 00:25:04,768
The first is, what were your thoughts around having

567
00:25:04,808 --> 00:25:06,830
you discard the rest of your cards

568
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:10,092
that you didn't use per turn instead of allowing a player

569
00:25:10,112 --> 00:25:12,094
to keep it so they could plan a turn ahead?

570
00:25:12,114 --> 00:25:15,436
And then my second one was kind of, yeah,

571
00:25:15,456 --> 00:25:16,457
so I'll ask the first one.

572
00:25:16,517 --> 00:25:16,877
Sure.

573
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:19,079
So the first question is, why do you

574
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:20,580
discard your hand at the end of turn

575
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,582
instead of in a game like Hearthstone or Magic

576
00:25:22,602 --> 00:25:23,302
where you keep your hand?

577
00:25:24,271 --> 00:25:29,314
So that's actually kind of a holdover from deck building games like Dominion or Ascension

578
00:25:29,334 --> 00:25:33,596
and board games like that, where in those games you would always discard your hand into

579
00:25:33,616 --> 00:25:37,979
the discard pile, and I just kind of kept that model when building Sleight of the Spire.

580
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:41,541
In general, what it does is it allows you to actually cycle through your deck and see

581
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:44,162
all your cards, which is a property you really want.

582
00:25:46,638 --> 00:25:49,799
So we actually have a relic in the game called Runic Pyramid

583
00:25:50,139 --> 00:25:52,820
that lets you keep your hand, and you can see how it totally

584
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,221
alters the play style of the game.

585
00:25:54,801 --> 00:25:58,403
It's more about holding onto cards and thinking about how

586
00:25:58,423 --> 00:26:00,423
you use them instead of being able to fly

587
00:26:00,463 --> 00:26:01,264
through your deck a lot.

588
00:26:01,824 --> 00:26:02,024
Sure.

589
00:26:02,464 --> 00:26:05,665
And so if you looked at the metrics around or feedback

590
00:26:05,705 --> 00:26:09,167
around that, did players like the former or the latter more?

591
00:26:09,187 --> 00:26:10,607
So.

592
00:26:12,602 --> 00:26:15,984
We never actually tested the game using

593
00:26:17,524 --> 00:26:19,345
the Hearthstone model of hand-holding

594
00:26:19,505 --> 00:26:21,906
because it was more based around deck builders,

595
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:25,748
like Dominion, which is kind of the originator

596
00:26:25,788 --> 00:26:27,389
of the deck-building genre in board games,

597
00:26:27,529 --> 00:26:29,210
and in that game, you discard your hand.

598
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:31,591
So I thought that what they were doing made sense there,

599
00:26:31,731 --> 00:26:33,692
and even in our original design document,

600
00:26:33,732 --> 00:26:35,753
we had it, and we just kind of kept going with that.

601
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,361
Cool, and the second question, sorry,

602
00:26:37,822 --> 00:26:39,884
was have you guys thought about co-op,

603
00:26:39,924 --> 00:26:41,706
and if so, if you were to do co-op,

604
00:26:41,826 --> 00:26:43,428
how would you guys think through that?

605
00:26:45,831 --> 00:26:48,794
We've thought about co-op, maybe in the future,

606
00:26:49,034 --> 00:26:51,157
but basically no comment for co-op.

607
00:26:54,115 --> 00:26:55,576
First of all, thank you for the great talk.

608
00:26:56,257 --> 00:26:59,679
And my question is, so Slate the Spy has a lot of really good enemies

609
00:26:59,719 --> 00:27:01,820
that challenge the different card archetypes.

610
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,982
So how did you go about enemy design?

611
00:27:05,002 --> 00:27:08,363
Did that come after the card design or were they sort of in tandem

612
00:27:08,444 --> 00:27:09,744
or did you have the enemies first?

613
00:27:10,805 --> 00:27:13,726
Most of the design for everything was kind of done in tandem.

614
00:27:13,847 --> 00:27:14,607
Like we...

615
00:27:16,113 --> 00:27:19,655
We created an initial set of like 20 or 30 cards

616
00:27:19,715 --> 00:27:21,855
and then started designing some basic enemies

617
00:27:22,035 --> 00:27:23,816
just to like make sure everything was good.

618
00:27:24,076 --> 00:27:25,456
Like the original version of the game,

619
00:27:26,337 --> 00:27:28,397
it just had a little single character

620
00:27:28,437 --> 00:27:29,658
that bobbed up and down.

621
00:27:29,678 --> 00:27:32,599
You had a couple basic enemies that were like zombies

622
00:27:32,659 --> 00:27:35,439
and slimes and you know, just stereotypical things.

623
00:27:35,479 --> 00:27:36,600
And you had basic cards.

624
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,680
And then from there, we just fleshed everything out,

625
00:27:39,201 --> 00:27:40,381
started developing the world

626
00:27:40,441 --> 00:27:42,121
and we kind of just built organically.

627
00:27:42,971 --> 00:27:46,833
Casey and I would often meet up and we would just have design sessions where we would just

628
00:27:46,953 --> 00:27:51,416
hash out hundreds and hundreds of ideas in like a huge brainstorming session and then

629
00:27:51,456 --> 00:27:51,936
go from there.

630
00:27:52,316 --> 00:27:56,859
So we didn't just say, okay, now it's cards, now it's enemies, because everything's so

631
00:27:56,899 --> 00:27:57,379
interlinked.

632
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:06,124
And just a quick follow-up, how did you decide to, I guess, make very predictable enemy attack

633
00:28:06,164 --> 00:28:06,544
patterns?

634
00:28:06,764 --> 00:28:08,325
Like, was that a conscious decision?

635
00:28:10,008 --> 00:28:12,369
So, how did we come up with our predictable

636
00:28:12,449 --> 00:28:13,289
enemy attack patterns?

637
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:17,110
The enemy intent system and all of the,

638
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:21,452
everything about that was actually a huge design process

639
00:28:21,492 --> 00:28:23,232
that took a long time to develop.

640
00:28:24,012 --> 00:28:25,613
The initial design of the game,

641
00:28:25,633 --> 00:28:28,274
they were more like, kind of like a Final Fantasy enemies,

642
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:29,874
where they just had like random move sets

643
00:28:29,934 --> 00:28:31,535
and they would randomly roll and move every turn.

644
00:28:31,995 --> 00:28:33,615
And we actually had a lot of problems with this.

645
00:28:33,796 --> 00:28:34,656
Players felt that...

646
00:28:35,567 --> 00:28:36,347
It was too random.

647
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:38,988
There's already a lot of randomness in the game

648
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:40,589
with all the card elements and everything.

649
00:28:40,749 --> 00:28:42,929
So that extra element of unpredictability

650
00:28:42,969 --> 00:28:43,629
just didn't work.

651
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:45,330
And then also you didn't know,

652
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:47,150
like how much block do I need on this turn?

653
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:49,471
I have no idea how much this enemy is attacking for.

654
00:28:50,031 --> 00:28:52,212
I don't have a good sense of can I attack or not?

655
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:54,752
So we actually spent a long time

656
00:28:54,992 --> 00:28:56,933
and we went through a bunch of different systems on that.

657
00:28:56,953 --> 00:28:58,973
I could do like a whole talk on that, yeah.

658
00:29:01,043 --> 00:29:03,744
My question is about the unstructured feedback you're collecting.

659
00:29:03,804 --> 00:29:07,505
So, it's great to see that you had those channels to collect that kind of feedback,

660
00:29:07,565 --> 00:29:10,246
but how did you go about filtering through all that

661
00:29:10,286 --> 00:29:12,966
and actually being able to leverage it as a two-person team?

662
00:29:13,427 --> 00:29:15,627
Sure. So, one is you don't sleep.

663
00:29:17,748 --> 00:29:21,769
The other is you actually get better at it as you start to go through it.

664
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:25,990
Honestly, we just had a manual process for it.

665
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:28,251
We thought about trying to automate that feedback,

666
00:29:28,371 --> 00:29:29,871
but it's very difficult because...

667
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:32,659
people can write the exact same bug

668
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:34,700
into like 10 different ways, you know.

669
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:38,902
So you will go through and we would look through it

670
00:29:39,062 --> 00:29:41,923
and we would try to organize things into different slots.

671
00:29:42,344 --> 00:29:44,745
Or we'd say, oh this is that bug I'm recognizing over here.

672
00:29:45,605 --> 00:29:47,346
And we would chat with each other while we're doing it.

673
00:29:48,466 --> 00:29:50,567
And honestly, we just did it manually

674
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:54,049
and kind of developed that skill over time.

675
00:29:54,489 --> 00:29:56,890
But there was no easy solution.

676
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:57,891
Cool, thank you.

677
00:29:58,828 --> 00:30:02,751
Hi. Regarding daily challenges, are you creating those procedurally or are you hand-making them?

678
00:30:02,871 --> 00:30:04,633
And how much balance are you putting on them?

679
00:30:04,653 --> 00:30:09,756
Sure. So regarding daily challenges, are we making them procedurally or hand-making them?

680
00:30:09,856 --> 00:30:11,538
I am absolutely not hand-making them.

681
00:30:12,258 --> 00:30:15,580
Those are procedurally generated based on basically the date.

682
00:30:16,021 --> 00:30:19,063
So we hit a time server, get a time stamp for the day,

683
00:30:19,363 --> 00:30:22,445
and then use that as the seed to procedurally generate everything.

684
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:25,571
And it's funny because a lot of people think that,

685
00:30:25,591 --> 00:30:27,372
you know, I'm sitting there every day,

686
00:30:27,412 --> 00:30:28,812
like on Christmas day, I'm like,

687
00:30:28,912 --> 00:30:31,673
all right, this is the, and I never did that.

688
00:30:31,753 --> 00:30:34,214
But because of some of the patterns that emerge,

689
00:30:34,434 --> 00:30:36,634
players get that impression, which is great,

690
00:30:36,795 --> 00:30:39,035
because, you know, some people really like that,

691
00:30:39,075 --> 00:30:40,376
but I'm absolutely not doing that.

692
00:30:40,636 --> 00:30:42,416
And are you spending any time balancing it

693
00:30:42,456 --> 00:30:43,257
or are you just letting it go?

694
00:30:43,696 --> 00:30:44,436
No, we just let it go.

695
00:30:45,057 --> 00:30:46,017
And what we do is,

696
00:30:46,938 --> 00:30:49,059
it's one of the things that we can use our metrics on

697
00:30:49,099 --> 00:30:51,580
to look at retroactively and see,

698
00:30:51,761 --> 00:30:54,842
like, we ended up changing and getting rid of Brewmaster,

699
00:30:55,222 --> 00:30:59,985
which was a daily modifier that ended up being no fun.

700
00:31:00,205 --> 00:31:01,586
But that's the kind of thing where you just,

701
00:31:01,686 --> 00:31:03,767
you test it, you see how it's received.

702
00:31:04,188 --> 00:31:06,709
It wasn't received well, so we modified it.

703
00:31:06,729 --> 00:31:07,509
All right, thanks.

704
00:31:08,778 --> 00:31:10,599
So you're drinking from the feedback firehose,

705
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,961
and the emotional load of that, how do you deal with it?

706
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:15,722
Because I know, you know, sometimes people are toxic,

707
00:31:15,742 --> 00:31:18,203
sometimes they're not, but even if you've got the same piece

708
00:31:18,263 --> 00:31:21,284
of feedback 300 times about something you don't want

709
00:31:21,304 --> 00:31:22,905
to change, how did you guys manage that?

710
00:31:23,618 --> 00:31:26,621
So I just want to make sure I got that right.

711
00:31:26,681 --> 00:31:29,584
So how do we manage getting like 300 pieces of the same feedback?

712
00:31:29,604 --> 00:31:32,207
So specifically the emotional load of it,

713
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:34,989
because if you're getting a lot of feedback,

714
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:38,253
even when it's polite, it's a lot of feedback.

715
00:31:38,293 --> 00:31:41,196
And I know that can be challenging to handle emotionally.

716
00:31:42,633 --> 00:31:45,997
Okay, so how do you deal with the emotional aspect of getting that feedback?

717
00:31:47,459 --> 00:31:50,042
You just hit delete on that piece of feedback if it's trash.

718
00:31:50,803 --> 00:31:51,944
I mean, it's really that simple.

719
00:31:53,426 --> 00:31:55,889
You even get to the point where you're like, oh, it's this guy again.

720
00:31:56,149 --> 00:31:58,132
I recognize the avatar, delete.

721
00:31:59,761 --> 00:32:01,022
I mean, let's be realistic.

722
00:32:01,082 --> 00:32:04,704
So, not every piece of feedback is created equally,

723
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:06,725
and so sometimes we'll have some people

724
00:32:06,765 --> 00:32:08,205
that we really recognize,

725
00:32:08,245 --> 00:32:11,327
like they'll give big, detailed pieces of feedback,

726
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:12,488
and so I'll be like, oh, it's him.

727
00:32:12,668 --> 00:32:14,188
Okay, I'll make sure to pay attention to this.

728
00:32:14,769 --> 00:32:19,251
But you just kind of get mute to the constant nonsense.

729
00:32:19,571 --> 00:32:23,393
So it was just something, at first it was a little jarring,

730
00:32:23,813 --> 00:32:26,675
and by the 18,000th piece of feedback,

731
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:27,295
you're like, whatever.

732
00:32:27,315 --> 00:32:28,896
Thank you, great talk.

733
00:32:30,611 --> 00:32:30,731
Hi.

734
00:32:30,851 --> 00:32:32,052
Thanks for doing the talk.

735
00:32:32,092 --> 00:32:32,872
I really appreciate it.

736
00:32:33,373 --> 00:32:35,714
You mentioned the Brewmaster modifier, and that kind of

737
00:32:35,734 --> 00:32:36,635
leads to my question.

738
00:32:37,735 --> 00:32:39,517
Through all the database feedback that you received,

739
00:32:39,577 --> 00:32:44,000
what do you think was the largest mechanic or system that

740
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,081
got left on the cutting room floor that you based on a

741
00:32:46,441 --> 00:32:47,362
database decision?

742
00:32:48,763 --> 00:32:51,665
So what was the largest thing that got cut based off of a

743
00:32:51,745 --> 00:32:52,585
database decision?

744
00:32:55,527 --> 00:32:55,727
I mean.

745
00:32:57,152 --> 00:33:03,404
That's tough because there were so many things that got changed or cut, but a lot of it is more...

746
00:33:04,541 --> 00:33:09,866
iterative. The daily was the biggest thing that just totally did a 180 all at once. And

747
00:33:09,907 --> 00:33:15,232
then the other thing happened was more earlier in design with our intent system and how that

748
00:33:15,272 --> 00:33:20,938
worked out where, I mean, we literally went through probably 10 different versions of

749
00:33:21,018 --> 00:33:25,923
our intent system before we got to what it's like. We actually used to have a system in

750
00:33:25,963 --> 00:33:26,764
place where you could...

751
00:33:28,075 --> 00:33:31,500
you would have detailed next move information on each enemy,

752
00:33:31,821 --> 00:33:32,982
and you would click on them,

753
00:33:33,022 --> 00:33:35,245
and there was almost like a sentence that would ride out

754
00:33:35,285 --> 00:33:36,988
and have the fluff and stuff in there.

755
00:33:37,288 --> 00:33:38,330
And that was kind of fun.

756
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:40,432
Some people liked it, but it had a ton of problems,

757
00:33:40,793 --> 00:33:41,494
so we got rid of it.

758
00:33:42,275 --> 00:33:42,515
Thank you.

759
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:49,144
I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the weekly update schedule

760
00:33:49,184 --> 00:33:50,586
that you had during early access.

761
00:33:50,606 --> 00:33:56,191
It sounds interesting, but it also sounds grueling and like there would be challenges

762
00:33:56,251 --> 00:33:58,133
there with keeping build stability.

763
00:33:58,974 --> 00:34:00,195
How did you get through that?

764
00:34:00,816 --> 00:34:01,016
Sure.

765
00:34:01,056 --> 00:34:06,121
So what were the challenges with the weekly updates and its grueling nature?

766
00:34:07,009 --> 00:34:12,013
Yes, it was very grueling, and yes, there were sometimes some stability issues where

767
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:15,655
you'd think, oh, everything's fine, it was good in the beta branch, and then we'd push

768
00:34:15,695 --> 00:34:18,438
it out and then we'd have to be hot fixing at midnight.

769
00:34:19,318 --> 00:34:23,061
But by having just a consistent cadence...

770
00:34:23,752 --> 00:34:26,735
where just every Thursday at this specific time

771
00:34:26,755 --> 00:34:29,457
we're doing it, we had a pretty good flow going.

772
00:34:29,937 --> 00:34:32,459
And yeah, we were definitely working more than 40 hours.

773
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:33,720
Like, absolutely.

774
00:34:34,821 --> 00:34:36,663
I would probably, in our next game,

775
00:34:36,683 --> 00:34:38,364
I would probably do biweekly updates

776
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:39,785
just for our own sanity's sake.

777
00:34:40,146 --> 00:34:43,248
And in particular, because you do waste a good amount of time.

778
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:45,550
Well, not waste, but you spend a good amount of time

779
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:47,712
writing up good patch notes,

780
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:50,294
finding community art and getting that all situated.

781
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:53,375
But in terms of build stability, that's

782
00:34:53,455 --> 00:34:56,136
where having our beta branch was kind of the savior of that.

783
00:34:56,536 --> 00:34:58,437
Because if we didn't have a beta branch that

784
00:34:58,477 --> 00:35:03,479
was getting daily updates, then those weekly updates

785
00:35:03,499 --> 00:35:04,560
would become a lot riskier.

786
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,941
But instead, because we had that beta branch,

787
00:35:07,161 --> 00:35:09,842
we're already going through five new builds at least

788
00:35:09,922 --> 00:35:11,463
before you get to that weekly update.

789
00:35:13,164 --> 00:35:13,424
Thank you.

790
00:35:14,748 --> 00:35:15,329
Oh, are we out of time?

791
00:35:15,349 --> 00:35:18,310
All right, we're out of time, but I'm going to go to a wrap-up room, so I don't know which

792
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:19,191
one it is, but you can follow me there.

793
00:35:19,211 --> 00:35:20,071
Thanks for coming, guys.

794
00:35:20,091 --> 00:35:20,311
Thanks.

795
00:35:20,331 --> 00:35:20,732
Thanks.

796
00:35:20,752 --> 00:35:20,872
Thanks.

797
00:35:20,912 --> 00:35:21,052
Thanks.

798
00:35:21,072 --> 00:35:21,212
Thanks.

799
00:35:21,232 --> 00:35:21,412
Thanks.

800
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:21,652
Thanks.

801
00:35:21,672 --> 00:35:21,832
Thanks.

802
00:35:21,852 --> 00:35:21,972
Thanks.

803
00:35:21,992 --> 00:35:22,112
Thanks.

804
00:35:22,132 --> 00:35:22,292
Thanks.

805
00:35:22,312 --> 00:35:22,453
Thanks.

806
00:35:22,473 --> 00:35:22,613
Thanks.

807
00:35:22,633 --> 00:35:22,773
Thanks.

808
00:35:22,793 --> 00:35:22,933
Thanks.

809
00:35:23,073 --> 00:35:23,353
Thanks.

810
00:35:23,373 --> 00:35:23,553
Thanks.

811
00:35:23,573 --> 00:35:23,713
Thanks.

812
00:35:23,733 --> 00:35:23,913
Thanks.

813
00:35:23,933 --> 00:35:24,053
Thanks.
