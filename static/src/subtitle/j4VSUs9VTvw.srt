1
00:00:04,554 --> 00:00:04,914
All right.

2
00:00:04,914 --> 00:00:08,957
Thank you very much for choosing this session.

3
00:00:08,957 --> 00:00:11,379
My name is Yut Saito.

4
00:00:11,379 --> 00:00:13,260
I'm a game creator.

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,741
And I am from Tokyo.

6
00:00:14,741 --> 00:00:18,164
And I am based in Tokyo.

7
00:00:18,164 --> 00:00:23,408
So today, I would like to speak about how I create Seaman.

8
00:00:23,408 --> 00:00:27,270
And with showing some other documentations,

9
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:30,733
I will mention about the kind of difficulty

10
00:00:30,733 --> 00:00:32,934
in creating a brand new software.

11
00:00:34,275 --> 00:00:36,657
So before starting everything, I would like to introduce myself.

12
00:00:36,657 --> 00:00:41,721
I'm a, again, I was born in 1962, the year that the Beatles released their first record.

13
00:00:41,721 --> 00:00:41,901
And I...

14
00:00:41,901 --> 00:00:42,141
I'm a...

15
00:00:42,141 --> 00:00:42,341
I'm a...

16
00:00:42,341 --> 00:00:42,521
I'm a...

17
00:00:42,521 --> 00:00:42,681
I'm a...

18
00:00:42,681 --> 00:00:42,762
I'm a...

19
00:00:42,762 --> 00:00:42,982
I'm a...

20
00:00:42,982 --> 00:00:43,342
I'm a...

21
00:00:43,342 --> 00:00:43,542
I'm a...

22
00:00:43,542 --> 00:00:43,742
I'm a...

23
00:00:43,742 --> 00:00:43,922
I'm a...

24
00:00:43,922 --> 00:00:44,103
I'm a...

25
00:00:44,103 --> 00:00:44,303
I'm a...

26
00:00:44,303 --> 00:00:44,363
I'm a...

27
00:00:44,363 --> 00:00:44,423
I'm a...

28
00:00:44,423 --> 00:00:44,943
I'm a...

29
00:00:44,943 --> 00:00:45,244
I'm a...

30
00:00:45,244 --> 00:00:45,324
I'm a...

31
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:54,084
Started my career when I was 28 or 29, maybe.

32
00:00:54,084 --> 00:00:58,028
So the first one did not sell well,

33
00:00:58,028 --> 00:00:59,829
so you may never know the first title.

34
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:04,113
But second one, which is now here known as SimTower,

35
00:01:04,113 --> 00:01:05,434
made a great score.

36
00:01:05,434 --> 00:01:12,541
This is a kind of simulation game of building a skyscraper.

37
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:12,901
And

38
00:01:14,085 --> 00:01:19,367
It's really released from Maxis as a sequel to SimCity,

39
00:01:19,367 --> 00:01:20,208
so it really sold well.

40
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:23,909
I'm a little bit nervous today.

41
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:25,950
It's okay, we love you.

42
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,371
Thank you.

43
00:01:30,371 --> 00:01:37,814
Woo!

44
00:01:37,814 --> 00:01:39,615
So SimTower is a,

45
00:01:41,298 --> 00:01:46,520
simulation that you have your own building and

46
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,780
oh this is a very good video on youtube so yeah this

47
00:01:50,780 --> 00:02:01,223
so when you stretch your building to a higher level uh you your elevator shaft have to cover

48
00:02:01,223 --> 00:02:06,324
more stories so there occurs a traffic jam so you have to be very careful otherwise

49
00:02:06,324 --> 00:02:10,305
the tenant will be leaving your building and you will get less

50
00:02:11,165 --> 00:02:17,890
profit. So you have to keep the customer satisfaction like a stress of waiting

51
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:24,175
elevator car in certain level and you have as the skyscraper grow bigger you

52
00:02:24,175 --> 00:02:31,300
have to have it more urban functions and so you have to put a like hospitals and

53
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:39,206
schools some other urban functions in it and the key is how to make your elevator

54
00:02:40,054 --> 00:02:44,777
very smart, setting the priority.

55
00:02:44,777 --> 00:02:46,798
Like, whatever.

56
00:02:46,798 --> 00:02:52,922
Anyway, I don't have so much time, so let's go to the next one.

57
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:54,042
I'm still a little bit nervous.

58
00:02:54,042 --> 00:02:58,145
So, O-Dama is one of my favorite game I have made.

59
00:02:58,145 --> 00:03:03,868
But it was not so much successful in sales,

60
00:03:03,868 --> 00:03:05,769
because we took too long.

61
00:03:07,873 --> 00:03:14,337
It was launched after Nintendo GameCube was almost vanishing in the market,

62
00:03:14,337 --> 00:03:21,140
and a brand new one was almost coming up.

63
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:29,484
So, but this is a very, very unique game in the way that this is...

64
00:03:29,484 --> 00:03:30,645
Oh, no.

65
00:03:30,645 --> 00:03:32,205
I'm sorry.

66
00:03:52,276 --> 00:04:01,501
This is a combination of pinball and I battled on the battlefield.

67
00:04:01,501 --> 00:04:11,526
And I had the motivation as a game creator that I wanted to simulate the crowd of the people.

68
00:04:11,526 --> 00:04:11,786
So...

69
00:04:11,786 --> 00:04:19,149
With a voice command, you were...

70
00:04:20,657 --> 00:04:25,462
controlling these troopers for certain directions as well as you hitting back

71
00:04:25,462 --> 00:04:31,329
the ball like a pinball do not not trying not to damage your soldiers but

72
00:04:31,329 --> 00:04:34,252
the enemy's soldier it's a tiny not easy

73
00:04:34,252 --> 00:04:43,381
right it's a kind of crazy yeah

74
00:04:47,318 --> 00:04:49,618
How many of you know this oldama?

75
00:04:49,618 --> 00:04:50,558
Is it a race?

76
00:04:50,558 --> 00:04:51,379
Oh, thank you.

77
00:04:51,379 --> 00:04:52,559
It's kind of fair thing.

78
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:58,040
So, thank you.

79
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,600
All right.

80
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:15,163
And I

81
00:05:19,225 --> 00:05:22,346
I would like to start talking about Seaman.

82
00:05:22,346 --> 00:05:26,307
So if an executive guy of a computer game company

83
00:05:26,307 --> 00:05:33,950
came to you and asked you if you can make guaranteed game

84
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:41,172
title to be a hit, which option would you

85
00:05:41,172 --> 00:05:43,192
like to choose?

86
00:05:48,610 --> 00:06:03,940
from all. Would you like to choose out of these three? One is it's a kind of dragons and dungeons

87
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:09,984
so that certain kind of market is guaranteed because it has a large share of the video game

88
00:06:09,984 --> 00:06:13,446
and adding a little bit new feature on it or

89
00:06:14,502 --> 00:06:18,425
Maybe another adventure game using famous licensed characters of Hollywood.

90
00:06:18,425 --> 00:06:25,992
That's also kinda guaranteed to be a hit, I think, though it costs a lot.

91
00:06:25,992 --> 00:06:31,257
Or a kinda rare beast of a game like nothing that came before it.

92
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:36,482
And I wound up going with option 3.

93
00:06:36,482 --> 00:06:38,224
That's gonna be a Seaman.

94
00:06:44,596 --> 00:06:46,617
And there are several reasons for this.

95
00:06:46,617 --> 00:06:48,458
I think for a creator, it's better

96
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:52,580
to choose the option that seems to fit the best,

97
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,141
rather than the one you think is correct.

98
00:06:55,141 --> 00:06:57,982
Option three differs from one and two,

99
00:06:57,982 --> 00:07:01,684
because putting into the practice

100
00:07:01,684 --> 00:07:07,907
requires inventiveness and courage.

101
00:07:07,907 --> 00:07:13,369
I'm a game creator who's good at making new titles.

102
00:07:16,253 --> 00:07:21,475
Because I am not very good at making sequels.

103
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:27,817
Even with my original title, that became hits.

104
00:07:27,817 --> 00:07:29,538
And that's why I went with choice three,

105
00:07:29,538 --> 00:07:32,759
although it looks as more difficult option anyway.

106
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:38,241
And that's what led to the release of Seaman.

107
00:07:40,425 --> 00:07:43,466
Seaman, among the other titles, holds the record of sales

108
00:07:43,466 --> 00:07:45,767
on the Dreamcast platform.

109
00:07:45,767 --> 00:07:49,648
It succeeded in attracting the most new customers, people

110
00:07:49,648 --> 00:07:51,989
who didn't own Dreamcast or Sega games up to the point.

111
00:07:51,989 --> 00:07:55,130
The game also enjoyed the largest ratio of female fans.

112
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:59,451
It even became a kind of social phenomenon in Japan.

113
00:07:59,451 --> 00:08:03,612
I will show you later about the TV program show introducing

114
00:08:03,612 --> 00:08:04,073
the Seaman.

115
00:08:04,073 --> 00:08:04,933
Back to the program.

116
00:08:04,933 --> 00:08:05,393
Thank you.

117
00:08:05,393 --> 00:08:07,814
See you later.

118
00:08:07,814 --> 00:08:08,154
Bye.

119
00:08:11,138 --> 00:08:15,880
This talk today is not about how to produce hit titles.

120
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:19,582
Then what the theme will be?

121
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:28,346
Well, when you're trying to create something completely new,

122
00:08:28,346 --> 00:08:30,947
you're always going to find yourself lost

123
00:08:30,947 --> 00:08:32,648
at some point in the process.

124
00:08:32,648 --> 00:08:37,450
I want to talk about how you find a way firmly

125
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,671
out from indecision to accomplish your work.

126
00:08:53,912 --> 00:09:00,357
So let's start about why I came up with this crazy game in the first place.

127
00:09:00,357 --> 00:09:02,579
It all started with a lunchtime joke.

128
00:09:02,579 --> 00:09:07,063
All it came down to was me having lunch with my staff

129
00:09:07,063 --> 00:09:09,665
at the company I was running at the time.

130
00:09:09,665 --> 00:09:13,948
At the time, my company was selling one game produced by me,

131
00:09:13,948 --> 00:09:15,890
I mean, Sim Tower,

132
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:20,794
and another non-game entertainment software managed by another team.

133
00:09:21,682 --> 00:09:23,584
This application worked on high-res Mac,

134
00:09:23,584 --> 00:09:25,385
and it lets you raise tropical fish

135
00:09:25,385 --> 00:09:27,226
with a beautiful screen of Macintosh.

136
00:09:27,226 --> 00:09:29,648
We have this huge staff undergoing this huge amount

137
00:09:29,648 --> 00:09:31,529
of research to make this app, the Phase 3 simulated,

138
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:32,009
the growth of living things.

139
00:09:50,434 --> 00:09:53,835
We had actual aquariums in our office,

140
00:09:53,835 --> 00:09:58,277
and there are staffers from agricultural colleges

141
00:09:58,277 --> 00:10:00,538
to observe them and digitize them.

142
00:10:00,538 --> 00:10:07,401
We were doing the kind of work research labs

143
00:10:07,401 --> 00:10:09,662
at Zeus normally do,

144
00:10:09,662 --> 00:10:13,043
instead of inside of an office

145
00:10:13,043 --> 00:10:14,864
right in the middle of the Roppongi.

146
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,485
Roppongi is a kind of very pricey place in Tokyo,

147
00:10:17,485 --> 00:10:19,126
so it's an area I like here.

148
00:10:22,461 --> 00:10:31,028
So it was considered that they were calculating things more minutely than they actually needed to.

149
00:10:31,028 --> 00:10:38,574
I was the manager of the company and I was jokingly complaining about this.

150
00:10:41,403 --> 00:10:48,007
I am not making an app that costs that much time and effort to research for a normal aquarium.

151
00:10:48,007 --> 00:10:53,810
Wouldn't people expect something that gives dramatic changes?

152
00:10:53,810 --> 00:11:00,173
Creatures growing feet and hands, or going up on the land?

153
00:11:00,173 --> 00:11:01,794
Isn't that more entertaining?

154
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:04,036
That's what I was saying to the staff around me.

155
00:11:05,604 --> 00:11:12,388
and the staff responded by laughing heartily and asking me all sorts of questions about it.

156
00:11:12,388 --> 00:11:18,193
I was on the roll at this point, so I kept saying more stuff.

157
00:11:18,193 --> 00:11:24,917
Around the time there was a TV show on Saturday nights with a famous comedian.

158
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:30,842
At the very end of the show, he used to look right at the camera and say,

159
00:11:30,842 --> 00:11:33,904
What are you looking at? You dump us?

160
00:11:35,838 --> 00:11:45,305
I thought maybe the fish living in the aquarium, being stared at by a lot of people from outside,

161
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:51,730
may think like that way too.

162
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,891
He would say, what are you looking at?

163
00:11:53,891 --> 00:12:03,979
Then I said, I wanted to have a voice recognition system on it to reply, shut down, just let

164
00:12:03,979 --> 00:12:04,699
me sleep.

165
00:12:06,655 --> 00:12:10,899
That's why I figured I'd need a human face.

166
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:13,881
And this reminded me of a sea monkey.

167
00:12:13,881 --> 00:12:19,625
A sea monkey, you know the sea monkeys?

168
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:26,150
Yeah, it's a real creature.

169
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:29,513
I purchased this creature.

170
00:12:29,513 --> 00:12:32,836
These eggs for, it's a hatches.

171
00:12:33,773 --> 00:12:36,975
and starts swimming once it's put in the water.

172
00:12:36,975 --> 00:12:42,539
The name of Sea Monkey and its package design

173
00:12:42,539 --> 00:12:45,220
stuck around in my child's brain only

174
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,062
because it looked so creepy to me.

175
00:12:47,062 --> 00:12:47,782
So I said, now.

176
00:13:00,689 --> 00:13:04,011
If I'm gonna put a name to it, it would be Seaman,

177
00:13:04,011 --> 00:13:07,252
not a sea monkey.

178
00:13:07,252 --> 00:13:13,695
That's the first Seaman's name was decided.

179
00:13:13,695 --> 00:13:17,276
After this joking lunch, my interest in this concept

180
00:13:17,276 --> 00:13:21,358
kept still running in my head.

181
00:13:21,358 --> 00:13:22,679
So I started sketching it out.

182
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:23,139
And one day,

183
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:33,832
I told my wife about those ideas.

184
00:13:33,832 --> 00:13:40,235
She said, wow, I had this.

185
00:13:40,235 --> 00:13:48,780
What a gross.

186
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,480
We dropped it all.

187
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:57,204
After some time had passed, one day my wife suddenly asked me, how is your concept going?

188
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,901
Why?

189
00:14:00,901 --> 00:14:03,902
I answered, you've got to do that.

190
00:14:03,902 --> 00:14:08,824
And I said, oh, but you said you hated that.

191
00:14:08,824 --> 00:14:11,426
And she said, yes, I did.

192
00:14:11,426 --> 00:14:16,468
But I didn't say I'm disinterested.

193
00:14:16,468 --> 00:14:25,832
That was a very surprise to me because she really liked that.

194
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:28,573
I mean, she didn't say she liked that.

195
00:14:29,594 --> 00:14:35,259
What I learned was the opposite of hate is not like, but indifferent.

196
00:14:35,259 --> 00:14:50,893
That concept is a very, very big change in my life, and that leads to semen concept also.

197
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:02,407
There was another incident right around then. This became another trigger for me to build a

198
00:15:02,407 --> 00:15:07,554
new theory, which turned out to be one of the most important elements of semen.

199
00:15:07,554 --> 00:15:12,801
I heard from my old friend that a pair of coworkers had gotten married.

200
00:15:13,773 --> 00:15:20,377
This couple pretty much constantly fought with each other all year.

201
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:25,000
It always put everyone around them on edge.

202
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,542
So hearing they got married was a big surprise to me.

203
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:33,465
My old friend, actually, he was a manager of those both people,

204
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:38,968
smiled and told me, hey, Saito-san,

205
00:15:38,968 --> 00:15:41,190
he said the same thing.

206
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:47,313
The opposite of like isn't hate, right?

207
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:54,876
So right then and there, I made a huge discovery.

208
00:15:54,876 --> 00:16:00,139
I decided to have this character's presence hated by most people,

209
00:16:00,139 --> 00:16:07,062
instead of being trying to, you know, have it being loved.

210
00:16:07,062 --> 00:16:10,343
If you succeed to make someone having a hate for something,

211
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:19,318
All it can take is a single flip of the switch for that to turn into a like.

212
00:16:19,318 --> 00:16:27,840
In fact, the more you hate something, the more your mind becomes preoccupied with it.

213
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:39,483
It made me think, maybe this kind of creepy, creepy games I was thinking of could gather

214
00:16:39,483 --> 00:16:41,023
interest from the people after all.

215
00:16:42,508 --> 00:16:48,513
I figured I might as well go all the way with it.

216
00:16:48,513 --> 00:16:50,315
Actually, I'm reading this.

217
00:16:50,315 --> 00:16:53,658
So with two programmers,

218
00:16:53,658 --> 00:16:56,401
I started a kind of prototyping of Seaman.

219
00:16:56,401 --> 00:16:59,183
And with a very private reason,

220
00:16:59,183 --> 00:17:04,508
I started here in Berkeley, in California, not in Japan.

221
00:17:04,508 --> 00:17:05,669
And one day,

222
00:17:06,767 --> 00:17:15,728
One executive guy of Sega came to me and he started talking about the new hardware.

223
00:17:15,728 --> 00:17:24,010
And they had a severe competition with Sony and they're looking for a very strong and strange

224
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:30,112
title which will be called a killer title for the hardware. Now it's called Dreamcast.

225
00:17:31,941 --> 00:17:35,625
So I opened up my laptop powerbook to the guy

226
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:38,067
and showed the prototype of Seaman.

227
00:17:38,067 --> 00:17:44,793
And he again said, wow, it's creepy.

228
00:17:44,793 --> 00:17:44,994
Yeah, I know.

229
00:17:44,994 --> 00:17:49,478
And that was the starting that Seaman project really just

230
00:17:49,478 --> 00:17:53,202
started forward.

231
00:18:05,967 --> 00:18:13,014
So, for my directions, I settled on pursuing three opposites.

232
00:18:13,014 --> 00:18:26,306
By opposite, I mean three major ways in which this game was different from the conventional

233
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:30,790
hit titles or your typical game in general.

234
00:18:31,892 --> 00:18:35,214
maybe more to be hated than to be disinterested.

235
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:36,135
Yeah, the first one is non-cute characters,

236
00:18:36,135 --> 00:18:38,597
as you may already know.

237
00:18:38,597 --> 00:18:41,700
The second point that instead of having users project themselves

238
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,601
onto the game's characters,

239
00:18:58,548 --> 00:19:00,109
We wanted to have them feel like someone's peeking at them

240
00:19:00,109 --> 00:19:00,909
from within the TV sets.

241
00:19:00,909 --> 00:19:02,009
No, actually, that was the third one.

242
00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:03,330
I was talking about the third one.

243
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:03,710
I'm sorry.

244
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,251
The second one is talk about the reality around the user,

245
00:19:05,251 --> 00:19:05,571
not a fancy world.

246
00:19:05,571 --> 00:19:05,911
Which means they, um...

247
00:19:26,067 --> 00:19:35,394
Games in general provide an alternate space, a fantasy world or whatever, spread out on

248
00:19:35,394 --> 00:19:36,735
the screen.

249
00:19:36,735 --> 00:19:41,699
Players' adventures around the space make new discoveries and so on.

250
00:19:41,699 --> 00:19:48,745
However, I wanted to have this game confuse it by mixing reality and fantasy.

251
00:19:50,073 --> 00:19:51,914
That leads to the reality fusing with the fantasy,

252
00:19:51,914 --> 00:19:53,634
producing a strange, confusing feeling.

253
00:19:53,634 --> 00:19:54,374
That's the second opposite.

254
00:19:54,374 --> 00:19:55,375
The third one opposite is how the game works

255
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:56,235
from the user's perspective.

256
00:19:56,235 --> 00:19:58,315
Normally, a game story proceeds with the game characters

257
00:19:58,315 --> 00:19:59,035
not being aware of the players.

258
00:19:59,035 --> 00:19:59,356
In movies, there's a

259
00:20:19,953 --> 00:20:23,355
This iron rule that characters can't look into the camera.

260
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:28,639
That's because audience presence must never be a factor.

261
00:20:28,639 --> 00:20:34,463
This game's character, however, looks right into the camera.

262
00:20:34,463 --> 00:20:35,504
He talks like the user,

263
00:20:35,504 --> 00:20:40,567
like he's looking right into their living room.

264
00:20:40,567 --> 00:20:44,270
The game uses the aquarium metaphor

265
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:47,012
to make this easy to understand.

266
00:20:50,273 --> 00:20:53,535
I worked to create a sort of a common link between users

267
00:20:53,535 --> 00:20:55,476
and Siemens during the development.

268
00:20:55,476 --> 00:21:10,945
At the time, I thought I was going wherever my creativity

269
00:21:10,945 --> 00:21:13,267
and curiosity took me.

270
00:21:13,267 --> 00:21:15,528
But I found myself realizing that I

271
00:21:15,528 --> 00:21:19,971
needed some guiding theories to lead the project to the goal.

272
00:21:22,183 --> 00:21:31,006
If it wasn't for these theories, I feel like I wouldn't have yielded to all the kinds of suggestions and requests.

273
00:21:31,006 --> 00:21:35,748
And the resulting game would have been very different.

274
00:21:35,748 --> 00:21:45,131
Creating something that's never existed before is a kind of battle against indecisions.

275
00:21:45,131 --> 00:21:50,993
When you're at a fork in the road, you need a focal point to strive for.

276
00:21:52,657 --> 00:21:58,901
And I concur this with these theories that served my boat.

277
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:05,366
About the word theory is here, I mean,

278
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:09,168
the theory is something it's not so much established.

279
00:22:09,168 --> 00:22:11,970
So if this English word is really correct or not,

280
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:13,151
I'm not sure yet.

281
00:22:13,151 --> 00:22:16,213
It's more like a hypothesis, hypothesis.

282
00:22:17,588 --> 00:22:24,856
Yeah, it's not yet proven, it's not approved by the authority, it's something like more

283
00:22:24,856 --> 00:22:34,366
unstable, insecure, that you built in your mind. So I made up my hypothesis

284
00:22:34,366 --> 00:22:38,831
and trying to prove that through the development.

285
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:49,287
So to make this a hit, we needed a strong theme running through the conversation with the seaman.

286
00:22:49,287 --> 00:22:51,750
That could capture anyone's interest. What is it?

287
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:56,976
And we decided the direction as the daily lives of the players themselves.

288
00:22:59,718 --> 00:23:03,521
Talking to a pit doesn't have any thematic element to it.

289
00:23:03,521 --> 00:23:05,063
It doesn't guarantee a hit.

290
00:23:05,063 --> 00:23:09,167
If you have all these disparate themes flying around,

291
00:23:09,167 --> 00:23:15,293
the players aren't going to spend their valuable time on it.

292
00:23:16,789 --> 00:23:19,731
There needs to be a structure of understanding

293
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:22,894
that players are working towards something,

294
00:23:22,894 --> 00:23:25,275
or else the players won't sit at the control seat.

295
00:23:25,275 --> 00:23:26,316
So to achieve that, the conversations

296
00:23:26,316 --> 00:23:28,598
had to be themed around something

297
00:23:28,598 --> 00:23:32,200
that any player would be interested in.

298
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,783
What kind of theme would any player be interested in?

299
00:23:44,983 --> 00:23:48,704
So our answer is that the daily lives of players.

300
00:23:48,704 --> 00:23:55,247
I think there are people who aren't interested in fantasy

301
00:23:55,247 --> 00:23:56,788
worlds, but my theory was that nobody's

302
00:23:56,788 --> 00:23:59,889
uninterested in themselves.

303
00:23:59,889 --> 00:24:02,190
Doesn't matter if they like it or dislike it.

304
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:06,292
So along with this theory, I started designing conversations.

305
00:24:15,129 --> 00:24:21,074
To put it in another way, the user shares his own personality and relationship along

306
00:24:21,074 --> 00:24:22,255
with the game's character.

307
00:24:22,255 --> 00:24:29,862
And these conversations were structured along with lines of, you are raising a pet, only

308
00:24:29,862 --> 00:24:33,965
to discover in the end that the pet was raising you all along.

309
00:24:33,965 --> 00:24:34,986
Question 2.

310
00:24:42,962 --> 00:24:47,445
How do we make people with even no interest in SEGA games purchase this?

311
00:24:47,445 --> 00:24:53,408
This was also very important to me.

312
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:59,572
Alongside the thrill of dealing with this grotesque pet,

313
00:24:59,572 --> 00:25:06,135
I made Seaman to be thoroughly dependent on the player.

314
00:25:07,647 --> 00:25:15,111
I think that helped tickle the player's parental instinct, and I think that connected in a

315
00:25:15,111 --> 00:25:22,334
big way to its success at the non-gamers market.

316
00:25:22,334 --> 00:25:30,317
Siemens' incredibly self-centered behavior greatly reduces the player's freedom, but

317
00:25:30,317 --> 00:25:32,758
people seem to like that part of it.

318
00:25:32,758 --> 00:25:36,660
You have this situation where you have to go every day.

319
00:25:37,907 --> 00:25:40,531
You go home every day at the same time.

320
00:25:40,531 --> 00:25:43,375
But it seems that he's connected to players,

321
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,997
finding it worth doing.

322
00:25:48,836 --> 00:25:57,524
I heard a lot of cases at bars and such, where players said they had to go home ASAP to feed

323
00:25:57,524 --> 00:25:58,866
their seamen.

324
00:25:58,866 --> 00:26:05,632
I also heard from many people about episodes where they'd go on vacation with their Dreamcast,

325
00:26:05,632 --> 00:26:09,816
plug into the hotel's TV sets, and feed their pet.

326
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:16,876
It seems like being needed by someone else energizes people.

327
00:26:16,876 --> 00:26:25,959
You also see a lot of cases where if they are no longer needed, that de-energizes people.

328
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:29,220
You often see this in the way people retire from work.

329
00:26:41,962 --> 00:26:45,944
How do we appeal this game in ads?

330
00:26:45,944 --> 00:26:53,089
So we decided to

331
00:26:53,089 --> 00:26:54,350
not to sell our new tech.

332
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:58,652
In the ads, we simply use the term raising.

333
00:26:58,652 --> 00:27:02,715
New technical jargon sounds cool

334
00:27:02,715 --> 00:27:06,618
if you're lining up in the event like GDC.

335
00:27:08,817 --> 00:27:11,599
Let's use this sentence for an example.

336
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:14,741
Wow, four-player real-time battle system

337
00:27:14,741 --> 00:27:17,522
provides exciting team combat or something like that.

338
00:27:17,522 --> 00:27:22,885
That really scares users, especially non-gamers.

339
00:27:22,885 --> 00:27:30,170
Creators tend to boast about what we are proud of, right?

340
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:35,333
But any entertainment needs to have a structure of understanding.

341
00:27:36,069 --> 00:27:43,091
because you're asking people to go through the entrance you've built. I think you need a trick

342
00:27:43,091 --> 00:27:49,572
in replacing their fear of the unknown with something they have already in their minds.

343
00:27:49,572 --> 00:27:54,874
When a person gains an understanding of something new,

344
00:27:54,874 --> 00:27:59,175
they tend to think of it using an understanding of something older.

345
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:07,725
That's why successful new technologies have always entered our lives by masquerading as old things.

346
00:28:07,725 --> 00:28:09,667
For example, cell phones.

347
00:28:09,667 --> 00:28:14,011
These were very different from regular phones.

348
00:28:14,011 --> 00:28:18,054
Rather closer to the radio transceivers.

349
00:28:18,054 --> 00:28:19,756
Our doorbells don't have bells.

350
00:28:27,028 --> 00:28:34,833
What you did see was raising, giving food, taking care of it, talking to it once a day.

351
00:28:34,833 --> 00:28:39,176
These phrases are what we used in the ads.

352
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:44,760
Instead of voice recognition technologies equipped with the AI technology things,

353
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:49,923
we consider it to promotions with old-fashioned pet raising.

354
00:28:57,687 --> 00:29:01,948
Actually, this is the graphic of the first ad of the seaman in the market.

355
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:07,230
And that was done not for a game magazine, but it was done for women's magazines.

356
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:12,691
And this is something we're about.

357
00:29:12,691 --> 00:29:21,574
The question four is one of the most difficult questions to me.

358
00:29:21,574 --> 00:29:25,035
Who should do the voice actor of the seaman?

359
00:29:25,035 --> 00:29:26,975
Does he have to be a famous one?

360
00:29:33,057 --> 00:29:37,700
Actually this question was one of the most difficult one of this project

361
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:41,382
Games like movies can create buzz by casting a famous actor

362
00:29:41,382 --> 00:29:44,224
So this question has been the biggest headache

363
00:29:44,224 --> 00:29:44,284
and

364
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:49,366
In the end we cast an actor who was almost completely unheard of for Seaman

365
00:29:49,366 --> 00:29:49,406
me

366
00:30:02,102 --> 00:30:03,363
I did that actor.

367
00:30:03,363 --> 00:30:12,465
This was the ultimate decision, and the purpose of this was just to keep the quality of voice

368
00:30:12,465 --> 00:30:14,325
and recording to its most.

369
00:30:14,325 --> 00:30:23,288
And this voice actor guy didn't cost anything.

370
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:28,209
And could do retakes wherever they wanted.

371
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:38,162
I as a director didn't have to worry about maintaining a good rapport between an actor

372
00:30:38,162 --> 00:30:38,882
and director.

373
00:30:38,882 --> 00:30:42,863
When the work was over, I as a voice actor would have no further voice jobs, so we didn't

374
00:30:42,863 --> 00:30:55,545
have to worry about rumors going around the industry like, oh, I did the Seaman's voice

375
00:30:55,545 --> 00:31:01,447
and the director was a total pain to work with, something like that.

376
00:31:04,526 --> 00:31:11,171
That's what allowed the identity of Seaman's voice to remain totally unknown.

377
00:31:11,171 --> 00:31:15,154
It was an incredibly unique decision that we have made.

378
00:31:15,154 --> 00:31:22,520
But in the end, projecting this mysterious air was really effective for promotion.

379
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:27,283
This is true even for the PlayStation version that was released two years later.

380
00:31:34,345 --> 00:31:35,066
Question five.

381
00:31:35,066 --> 00:31:36,046
Yeah, how about the voice actor?

382
00:31:36,046 --> 00:31:40,289
How about the other voice actor?

383
00:31:40,289 --> 00:31:43,171
Yeah, we needed someone else to support.

384
00:32:06,276 --> 00:32:14,901
But just like the rookie, political candidates benefit from a big name.

385
00:32:14,901 --> 00:32:21,105
And actually, we needed somebody very famous to support this unknown character.

386
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:25,808
And we picked Leonard Nimoy.

387
00:32:25,808 --> 00:32:28,330
And that's my idea.

388
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:29,611
I don't know why I did it.

389
00:32:32,118 --> 00:32:37,140
wanted to have him, but finally SEGA America agreed to make a contract with him.

390
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,801
I didn't think it was a very

391
00:32:38,801 --> 00:32:41,402
easy job because he's really a star, but

392
00:32:41,402 --> 00:32:45,824
you know, for the Japanese edition, we employed a famous actor with a long

393
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,545
career.

394
00:32:53,619 --> 00:32:56,560
and have him use his real name within the games.

395
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,821
And Mr. Leonard Nimoy named his own name in the MC also.

396
00:32:58,821 --> 00:33:01,902
The results of that were great.

397
00:33:01,902 --> 00:33:03,103
I will show you.

398
00:33:27,417 --> 00:33:27,637
Hmm.

399
00:33:27,637 --> 00:33:31,179
Let's head over to the tank.

400
00:33:31,179 --> 00:33:31,279
Hmm.

401
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:54,571
Of running out of food for Seaman later.

402
00:33:56,303 --> 00:34:01,365
But if you manage the larvae well, you should have no problem keeping sea man well fed.

403
00:34:01,365 --> 00:34:14,531
At the moment, the habitat contains two young men.

404
00:34:14,531 --> 00:34:15,692
They appear to be...

405
00:34:25,109 --> 00:34:51,193
I'm hungry. Give me something to eat. I'm starving. I'll bet if I

406
00:34:51,193 --> 00:34:51,513
want.

407
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,201
Don't tell your mother.

408
00:34:54,201 --> 00:34:54,721
It's fine.

409
00:34:54,721 --> 00:35:00,024
And with Claim Rate Guard, they won't raise your rates just because of a claim.

410
00:35:00,024 --> 00:35:01,966
That's why you're my favorite.

411
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:02,246
I know.

412
00:35:02,246 --> 00:35:08,550
It's good to be in good hands.

413
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:09,110
I'm sorry.

414
00:35:09,381 --> 00:35:18,169
Angry Atari Amiga, CD-i, Coleco, Vignax, Television, Sega, Neo Geo, TurboGrafx-16, Odyssey, 3DO, Commodore, Nintendo

415
00:35:18,169 --> 00:35:20,792
This is one of the funniest YouTube videos ever.

416
00:35:20,792 --> 00:35:23,735
But I heard it was once a porn about semen.

417
00:35:23,735 --> 00:35:24,535
I just heard. That's all.

418
00:35:24,535 --> 00:35:27,658
A Dreamcast game that sends you to porn.

419
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:29,740
More like wet Dreamcast.

420
00:35:44,914 --> 00:35:49,777
Set the time? Since when did video game consoles start telling time?

421
00:35:49,777 --> 00:35:55,142
I have a clock! A rolling rock clock! I don't need this shit! I can wear a wa-

422
00:35:55,142 --> 00:35:57,523
Well, thank god for the instructions.

423
00:35:57,523 --> 00:36:06,150
So you have to raise the heat up to a certain range, and then just wait for the egg to hatch.

424
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:11,614
All right, while the game does its thing, let's read up on a little history.

425
00:36:12,091 --> 00:36:18,272
According to the manual, the species that we will be raising was originally discovered in Egypt in the 1930s by a French

426
00:36:18,272 --> 00:36:21,453
anthro-bio-archaeologist, Jean-Paul Gasset.

427
00:36:21,453 --> 00:36:28,695
His hypothesis suggests that the creature was responsible for transferring knowledge and language across the land during the Third Dynasty.

428
00:36:28,695 --> 00:36:31,256
The creature is said to be the reincarnation...

429
00:36:31,256 --> 00:36:31,496
I'm sorry.

430
00:36:31,496 --> 00:36:34,277
You turn off the game, come back to it a day later...

431
00:36:35,333 --> 00:36:37,694
Or five minutes later, like me.

432
00:36:37,694 --> 00:36:39,035
You visit often.

433
00:36:39,035 --> 00:36:42,937
If one didn't know better, one might assume you're quite obsessed.

434
00:36:42,937 --> 00:36:44,919
Or you have nothing better to do.

435
00:36:44,919 --> 00:36:54,564
Oh, I have better things to do!

436
00:36:54,564 --> 00:36:54,905
No.

437
00:36:54,905 --> 00:36:57,326
I think it's not working very well.

438
00:36:57,326 --> 00:36:59,707
No way!

439
00:36:59,707 --> 00:37:02,389
It's an official Fanacom disc game that...

440
00:37:13,232 --> 00:37:19,335
That was the process we went through to produce the game. It was released in July 1999.

441
00:37:19,335 --> 00:37:29,221
A lot of news and info programs on Japanese TV introduced it alongside the AIBO robot released

442
00:37:29,221 --> 00:37:30,301
by Sony. And kind of a...

443
00:37:37,394 --> 00:37:42,857
I think they are saying as if we are entering a new era where we lived alongside computers.

444
00:37:42,857 --> 00:37:50,862
SEMA wound up selling a surprise number of copies, and we found out that the majority

445
00:37:50,862 --> 00:37:59,187
of purchases were women and a lot of players bought the game with the Dreamcast hardware

446
00:37:59,187 --> 00:38:00,028
system also.

447
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:04,771
To put it another way, it earned a lot of new users for us.

448
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:15,686
Things proceeded exactly as we theorized they would.

449
00:38:15,686 --> 00:38:16,407
I was lucky.

450
00:38:16,407 --> 00:38:23,794
To be frank, I don't think SEGA believed many of the theories

451
00:38:23,794 --> 00:38:26,296
I put across to them.

452
00:38:26,296 --> 00:38:31,461
They didn't think it would sell that much.

453
00:38:31,461 --> 00:38:33,483
I agree with that.

454
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:46,396
I learned that when they don't make the full planned order to the voice mic that comes

455
00:38:46,396 --> 00:38:55,062
with the game to the factory in Taiwan, we ran out of parts quick and thanks to that

456
00:38:55,062 --> 00:38:58,824
we had a mounting of back orders.

457
00:38:58,824 --> 00:39:05,669
Having the legacy, legendary games sell out in the market only further contributed to

458
00:39:05,669 --> 00:39:06,009
the name.

459
00:39:07,438 --> 00:39:09,078
mythological air around it.

460
00:39:09,078 --> 00:39:12,639
It was really good news to Sega.

461
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:15,280
As I've shown, creating a new category of game isn't just

462
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:20,041
about completing the game program and graphics.

463
00:39:20,041 --> 00:39:22,062
You need to...

464
00:39:22,062 --> 00:39:31,464
You need enough consistency to answer the several thousand questions about it

465
00:39:31,464 --> 00:39:33,825
from the people involved.

466
00:39:34,877 --> 00:39:39,540
all the undefined things that need to be pinned down.

467
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:46,466
If these things lost their consistency during the development, it'll break apart mid-flight.

468
00:39:46,466 --> 00:39:58,316
I have ever read a journal written by the wife of movie director Francis Ford Coppola.

469
00:39:58,316 --> 00:39:58,696
And this was

470
00:40:06,605 --> 00:40:14,229
the book about the middle of the production of the uh francis ford coppola and he was um

471
00:40:14,229 --> 00:40:17,170
he was um in the middle of the um the status being lost

472
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:19,571
if the leader starts feeling lost developing falls into uh

473
00:40:19,571 --> 00:40:20,112
um really really bad situations

474
00:40:34,945 --> 00:40:42,573
And a game designer needs to start with the faith and conviction that's stronger than a rock.

475
00:40:42,573 --> 00:40:44,495
It's not that you are prepared for everything.

476
00:40:44,495 --> 00:40:45,897
So you need to build your own theories.

477
00:40:45,897 --> 00:40:51,022
If you ask me what the most important thing is, though,

478
00:41:01,777 --> 00:41:05,461
asked me if it's having those theories, this is not what I said.

479
00:41:05,461 --> 00:41:07,884
The most important thing is that you execute it, not only to explore your theories in your

480
00:41:07,884 --> 00:41:07,964
mind.

481
00:41:26,438 --> 00:41:34,306
test your hypothesis in reality and prove it as correct by completing your titles.

482
00:41:34,306 --> 00:41:44,595
There are probably several hundred people who come up with an idea almost as unique as yours,

483
00:41:44,595 --> 00:41:52,363
but if there's a way to show off your inner strength, it's by bringing that theory to reality.

484
00:41:54,092 --> 00:41:58,053
It takes one person out of several hundred to do that.

485
00:41:58,053 --> 00:42:03,074
Hitting an idea of taking a talking fish is not an exploit.

486
00:42:03,074 --> 00:42:08,475
If we are allowed to call semen as an achievement,

487
00:42:08,475 --> 00:42:13,276
we think of it as dumb because we did manage

488
00:42:13,276 --> 00:42:16,577
to accomplish this crazy idea as a commercial product

489
00:42:16,577 --> 00:42:18,618
and put it into the market.

490
00:42:18,618 --> 00:42:18,898
So please do not.

491
00:42:23,553 --> 00:42:26,475
Be scared to be different from the conventional existing games?

492
00:42:26,475 --> 00:42:29,298
I encourage you to swim against the stream.

493
00:42:29,298 --> 00:42:30,899
Do not try to predict the future, but just make it.

494
00:42:30,899 --> 00:42:34,422
Seaman was blessed by a development team,

495
00:42:34,422 --> 00:42:35,263
including Mr. Endo, Aka Roy-san,

496
00:42:35,263 --> 00:42:36,344
Suzuki-san, Ito Suzuki Hirose,

497
00:42:50,233 --> 00:42:56,715
who believed in me enough that they even quit their job to participate in this project.

498
00:42:56,715 --> 00:43:05,217
I also got to collaborate with a very generous publisher whose name is SEGA.

499
00:43:05,217 --> 00:43:10,659
Those two parties are what allowed this to become a hit,

500
00:43:10,659 --> 00:43:13,920
and I think it provides a precious case study to look at.

501
00:43:17,873 --> 00:43:21,175
I'd like to thank Fukui-san who helped me

502
00:43:21,175 --> 00:43:21,475
this trip,

503
00:43:21,475 --> 00:43:30,980
Lopez-san who coordinated my trip also,

504
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:32,620
Josh-san,

505
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:35,022
Studio8-no-yon-san,

506
00:43:35,022 --> 00:43:35,462
Kyoko-san,

507
00:43:35,462 --> 00:43:37,803
for a great translation,

508
00:43:37,803 --> 00:43:40,284
as well as Megan at GDC

509
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:42,785
who gave me such a great opportunity to be here.

510
00:43:42,785 --> 00:43:45,546
And most of you, I would like to thank you for being here.

511
00:43:45,546 --> 00:43:46,947
Thank you very much. Thanks for listening.

512
00:43:53,320 --> 00:44:01,042
So we have another 15 minutes, so Kyokusan will be helping me to...

513
00:44:01,042 --> 00:44:05,483
If you have any questions, please, please raise your hand.

514
00:44:05,483 --> 00:44:10,565
Yeah, or if you don't mind, we're recording audio,

515
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:12,525
so there are two mics in the room.

516
00:44:12,525 --> 00:44:16,466
If you could come up to either of those mics.

517
00:44:16,466 --> 00:44:16,706
Thanks.

518
00:44:16,706 --> 00:44:17,506
So bright.

519
00:44:17,506 --> 00:44:18,567
Hi, can I go?

520
00:44:18,567 --> 00:44:18,727
Yes.

521
00:44:18,727 --> 00:44:20,447
Hi, I'd just like to know how you decided...

522
00:44:20,928 --> 00:44:24,870
what things to put in it it understood because I got into a lot of trouble because it asked me if

523
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:32,113
I was having an affair. Getting personal. Would you speak slowly please? Okay yes so how did you

524
00:44:32,113 --> 00:44:38,455
decide what scenarios or what situations that it would understand and respond to?

525
00:44:40,236 --> 00:44:40,396
So...

526
00:44:40,396 --> 00:44:42,719
Can I...

527
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:46,643
Do you want to rephrase that?

528
00:44:46,643 --> 00:45:00,560
Actually, that was a very good question because I...

529
00:45:01,548 --> 00:45:05,491
I wrote the script, I mean, I wrote the dialogues myself.

530
00:45:05,491 --> 00:45:09,194
If we had two or three or more writers,

531
00:45:09,194 --> 00:45:11,556
we couldn't have a kind of consistency.

532
00:45:11,556 --> 00:45:15,299
I mean, it will be kind of a mixture

533
00:45:15,299 --> 00:45:20,163
of several personality, and that will be kind of very danger

534
00:45:20,163 --> 00:45:23,766
to entertain people, because sometimes the personality

535
00:45:23,766 --> 00:45:25,988
of a scene changes day by day, and that

536
00:45:25,988 --> 00:45:26,988
is a very risky thing.

537
00:45:26,988 --> 00:45:28,389
So I did one person.

538
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:33,772
The key is one person does that and I did that from my experience.

539
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:36,913
So I'm not a professional writer.

540
00:45:36,913 --> 00:45:38,774
I just express what I thought.

541
00:45:38,774 --> 00:45:43,035
And so SEMA is something like a part of me actually.

542
00:45:43,035 --> 00:45:46,937
And I did the voice actor too.

543
00:45:46,937 --> 00:45:49,017
So it's a strange feeling.

544
00:45:49,017 --> 00:45:51,658
But if you're running your own studio, right?

545
00:45:51,658 --> 00:45:51,738
No.

546
00:45:51,738 --> 00:45:52,419
Oh, no.

547
00:45:52,419 --> 00:45:52,979
I wish I was.

548
00:45:52,979 --> 00:45:53,039
OK.

549
00:45:53,039 --> 00:45:57,841
But if you are too, then you have to be careful that,

550
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:06,533
The tiny sentence, tiny dialogues have a kind of personality in it.

551
00:46:06,533 --> 00:46:12,115
And the user will be very aware of that if you have several personalities in one program.

552
00:46:12,115 --> 00:46:15,036
That's very subtle, but they will know.

553
00:46:15,036 --> 00:46:18,557
And that causes a kind of tiny contradiction.

554
00:46:18,557 --> 00:46:22,499
The key is that one personality...

555
00:46:23,207 --> 00:46:33,392
does everything at once, that's the key to have a deep personality in the computer program.

556
00:46:33,392 --> 00:46:34,973
Was it a good answer?

557
00:46:34,973 --> 00:46:35,173
Yeah.

558
00:46:35,173 --> 00:46:35,614
Thank you.

559
00:46:35,614 --> 00:46:35,854
Thank you.

560
00:46:35,854 --> 00:46:35,994
Hello.

561
00:46:35,994 --> 00:46:36,394
Oh, that was loud.

562
00:46:36,394 --> 00:46:37,475
On my other side.

563
00:46:37,475 --> 00:46:38,815
Yeah.

564
00:46:38,815 --> 00:46:38,955
Yes.

565
00:46:38,955 --> 00:46:42,117
Your friend.

566
00:46:42,117 --> 00:46:42,677
Yeah.

567
00:46:42,677 --> 00:46:43,057
Yeah.

568
00:46:43,057 --> 00:46:43,458
Yeah.

569
00:46:43,458 --> 00:46:43,758
Yeah.

570
00:46:43,758 --> 00:46:44,118
Yeah.

571
00:46:44,118 --> 00:46:44,618
Yeah.

572
00:46:44,618 --> 00:46:44,838
Yeah.

573
00:46:44,838 --> 00:46:44,918
Yeah.

574
00:46:44,918 --> 00:46:44,998
Yeah.

575
00:46:45,827 --> 00:46:52,572
Could you talk a little bit about the kind of the weird viral marketing stuff

576
00:46:52,572 --> 00:46:58,957
like the strange websites and all of that were you involved with that and how

577
00:46:58,957 --> 00:47:00,238
did it come to be?

578
00:47:00,238 --> 00:47:00,939
What is that?

579
00:47:00,939 --> 00:47:02,960
It's a promotion for various websites.

580
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:03,601
Shiman?

581
00:47:03,601 --> 00:47:09,025
Are you talking about the kind of weird history things?

582
00:47:09,025 --> 00:47:09,565
Yeah.

583
00:47:11,667 --> 00:47:17,130
When I was 10 years old, my father took me to a kind of

584
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:18,710
strange exhibition.

585
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:20,331
That was...

586
00:47:20,331 --> 00:47:23,913
Kyoko-san, would you translate for me?

587
00:47:23,913 --> 00:47:24,753
Sure.

588
00:47:24,753 --> 00:47:31,516
There was a strange fish called shirakansu,

589
00:47:31,516 --> 00:47:34,777
and the body of that fish was displayed in Tokyo.

590
00:47:34,777 --> 00:47:41,000
It was a strange fish that was called a fossil of Africa.

591
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:41,580
Is that okay?

592
00:47:43,142 --> 00:47:46,824
I imitated that and, like a real dolphin,

593
00:47:46,824 --> 00:47:52,607
I did a seaman exhibition at a museum when I released Seaman.

594
00:47:52,607 --> 00:47:54,588
At a real museum.

595
00:47:54,588 --> 00:47:57,349
I actually put a TV monitor there,

596
00:47:57,349 --> 00:48:00,731
and made a white stone and a fossil.

597
00:48:00,731 --> 00:48:03,332
What was it called in the bottle?

598
00:48:03,332 --> 00:48:07,855
I put it in a formalin and put it there.

599
00:48:07,855 --> 00:48:10,156
Creating that kind of world view,

600
00:48:10,156 --> 00:48:11,017
I think of it now.

601
00:48:11,732 --> 00:48:15,294
I wanted to create a world view, but...

602
00:48:15,294 --> 00:48:16,996
You speak Japanese, right?

603
00:48:16,996 --> 00:48:17,656
Does it make sense?

604
00:48:17,656 --> 00:48:18,697
She's going to translate.

605
00:48:18,697 --> 00:48:18,977
Please go ahead.

606
00:48:18,977 --> 00:48:19,798
I also made a website.

607
00:48:19,798 --> 00:48:21,199
I made a temporary website.

608
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:22,140
I made a temporary website.

609
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:22,720
Temporary?

610
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:28,084
I made a temporary website.

611
00:48:28,084 --> 00:48:29,185
I made a temporary website.

612
00:48:29,185 --> 00:48:34,349
I made a temporary website.

613
00:48:38,293 --> 00:48:39,833
No, I don't know what that means.

614
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:42,435
So, the marketing team is the ones in charge of that?

615
00:48:42,435 --> 00:48:46,116
Okay, so it sounds like...

616
00:48:46,116 --> 00:48:52,739
I wasn't involved in the entirety of the whole entire viral marketing campaign,

617
00:48:52,739 --> 00:48:56,080
but the one that was, I guess, stemmed from an idea that I...

618
00:48:56,080 --> 00:49:00,202
or an experience that I had is that my dad took me to this very...

619
00:49:01,955 --> 00:49:04,317
unique, interesting exhibit when I was 10 years old.

620
00:49:04,317 --> 00:49:07,880
And it was basically kind of a,

621
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,742
I guess it's maybe a history museum

622
00:49:09,742 --> 00:49:12,864
or an aquarium sort of slash historical museum.

623
00:49:12,864 --> 00:49:16,668
And they had a creature from Africa called the sea buccaneer.

624
00:49:21,537 --> 00:49:22,397
Shira-cans?

625
00:49:22,397 --> 00:49:25,540
And it was...

626
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:27,681
How do you say shira-cans in English?

627
00:49:27,681 --> 00:49:28,642
Silicans.

628
00:49:28,642 --> 00:49:30,864
So it was an entire exhibit on that,

629
00:49:30,864 --> 00:49:34,807
and it came in different shapes and forms.

630
00:49:34,807 --> 00:49:38,730
They had a skeletal sort of writing or a...

631
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:40,791
you know, photos of it, exhibits of it.

632
00:49:40,791 --> 00:49:43,053
And I thought that was pretty cool.

633
00:49:43,053 --> 00:49:45,515
Like, it left a really strong impression on me.

634
00:49:45,515 --> 00:49:49,938
So with Seaman, I kind of wanted to recreate that exact same experience that I had.

635
00:49:50,359 --> 00:49:51,600
when I went to that exhibit.

636
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:55,763
And so we came up with ideas as if this really

637
00:49:55,763 --> 00:49:58,045
existed in our world and basically

638
00:49:58,045 --> 00:50:00,907
had this exhibit or installation where

639
00:50:00,907 --> 00:50:02,809
we would talk about the history of semen,

640
00:50:02,809 --> 00:50:04,950
give them a background, give them a story,

641
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:08,433
and even have these mock-ups of what semen looked like.

642
00:50:08,433 --> 00:50:12,437
And so that was something that stemmed from my own experience

643
00:50:12,437 --> 00:50:15,539
that I wanted to exploit and set really the background so

644
00:50:15,539 --> 00:50:17,661
that people would really get into the story

645
00:50:17,661 --> 00:50:19,182
and the history of semen.

646
00:50:20,542 --> 00:50:27,767
great. All right. So in your talk, you mentioned that you

647
00:50:27,767 --> 00:50:31,129
wanted the player to feel like C man was reaching out to them

648
00:50:31,129 --> 00:50:34,171
and interacting with their life as opposed to the player

649
00:50:34,171 --> 00:50:38,014
interacting with his world. Technology has changed a lot

650
00:50:38,014 --> 00:50:40,516
since the original game was developed.

651
00:50:41,316 --> 00:50:45,120
Now we have social media, webcams, and VR, etc.

652
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:52,467
If you were making a game like Seaman today, or if you had the technology that exists today, back then,

653
00:50:52,467 --> 00:50:56,391
what kind of technologies would you integrate to create a more immersive experience?

654
00:50:56,391 --> 00:51:00,454
Yeah, I'm very much interested in what's called the wearable,

655
00:51:00,454 --> 00:51:06,580
so that I can collect the information all over the world about him.

656
00:51:07,687 --> 00:51:13,490
Unfortunately, iOS has a lot of the guidelines between the applications.

657
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:17,272
One application cannot take the information from others, right?

658
00:51:17,272 --> 00:51:24,555
Android is more easy to do that because once, let's say, the application of semen detects

659
00:51:24,555 --> 00:51:28,257
that you got a mail from your girlfriend but you didn't respond to that.

660
00:51:28,797 --> 00:51:30,479
Oh, why you didn't do that?

661
00:51:30,479 --> 00:51:31,340
What happened between?

662
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:33,602
That kind of thing, very much you want to do,

663
00:51:33,602 --> 00:51:36,504
but iOS is limiting that kind of activity

664
00:51:36,504 --> 00:51:39,727
between the application.

665
00:51:39,727 --> 00:51:45,471
So and these kind of things, like iWatch and Apple Watch

666
00:51:45,471 --> 00:51:48,874
and some other devices.

667
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:53,442
Yeah, it's very much interesting.

668
00:51:53,442 --> 00:51:55,124
But the first thing I just want to do

669
00:51:55,124 --> 00:51:59,787
is the things I just mentioned, like your activity

670
00:51:59,787 --> 00:52:01,788
in other applications.

671
00:52:01,788 --> 00:52:04,169
Like you were calling somebody so many times,

672
00:52:04,169 --> 00:52:06,831
but you couldn't get any call back.

673
00:52:06,831 --> 00:52:09,973
And Steven's going to start mentioning

674
00:52:09,973 --> 00:52:11,834
about the relationship between two of you,

675
00:52:11,834 --> 00:52:14,196
something like that.

676
00:52:14,196 --> 00:52:15,496
Is what, yeah.

677
00:52:16,263 --> 00:52:20,986
And that is totally different from that kind of dissemination

678
00:52:20,986 --> 00:52:26,810
in the way that this version has a scenarios, huge scenarios.

679
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:30,392
But to do that kind of data, smartphone games,

680
00:52:30,392 --> 00:52:34,955
we just need a real AI, endlessly speaking.

681
00:52:34,955 --> 00:52:37,057
And that's what I have been working on.

682
00:52:37,057 --> 00:52:40,539
So it's not achieved, so I couldn't release a new version.

683
00:52:40,539 --> 00:52:43,001
But that's one of the most things

684
00:52:43,001 --> 00:52:45,242
I'm very much interested in.

685
00:52:45,242 --> 00:52:45,483
OK, thank you.

686
00:52:45,483 --> 00:52:45,803
Thank you.

687
00:52:47,337 --> 00:52:52,460
Okay, question, do you especially like writing manuals?

688
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:56,282
I'm asking that, the manual that come with the game.

689
00:52:56,282 --> 00:52:56,843
What is manual?

690
00:52:56,843 --> 00:52:58,504
The manual, yeah.

691
00:52:58,504 --> 00:53:02,706
Because we saw Seaman, it has an interesting history

692
00:53:02,706 --> 00:53:03,387
at the beginning.

693
00:53:03,907 --> 00:53:11,332
Sim Tower, I remember it was very interesting because midway through the manual you explained

694
00:53:11,332 --> 00:53:12,773
how the game was working.

695
00:53:12,773 --> 00:53:19,178
At the very end you said, I want these two put west and east in touch, and you actually

696
00:53:19,178 --> 00:53:22,160
signed the manual, if I remember well.

697
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,762
And that I don't remember, not their case.

698
00:53:24,762 --> 00:53:30,046
So is there, do you have a special interest in doing these kind of things?

699
00:53:40,369 --> 00:53:50,132
Did you write all the manuals?

700
00:53:50,132 --> 00:53:55,074
I mean, the first, second, and third volumes.

701
00:53:55,074 --> 00:53:55,754
Yes.

702
00:53:55,754 --> 00:53:57,635
You also wrote the autographs.

703
00:53:57,635 --> 00:54:01,417
Did you write them because you were interested in writing them?

704
00:54:02,903 --> 00:54:11,328
As well, as company make the presentation of the new game, but they don't spend so much

705
00:54:11,328 --> 00:54:12,048
time on it.

706
00:54:12,048 --> 00:54:18,192
They just spend half an hour before the presentation in the cafe and bring that.

707
00:54:18,192 --> 00:54:19,533
Producers spend, you know...

708
00:54:20,822 --> 00:54:23,984
a year or two on that, always thinking about that.

709
00:54:23,984 --> 00:54:29,648
So basically, I think producer should,

710
00:54:29,648 --> 00:54:34,211
like the theory, throw that kind of clue or hint

711
00:54:34,211 --> 00:54:37,694
to the ads people, manual writers,

712
00:54:37,694 --> 00:54:41,797
or the hook or maybe axis.

713
00:54:41,797 --> 00:54:47,882
Because the best game is the game

714
00:54:47,882 --> 00:54:49,463
that people don't need a manual.

715
00:54:50,089 --> 00:54:55,335
Game itself, like the Nintendo game, speaks about its role first.

716
00:54:55,335 --> 00:54:58,859
I think so, yeah.

717
00:54:58,859 --> 00:55:02,203
But I did myself over writing because I love writing

718
00:55:02,203 --> 00:55:06,048
and I didn't believe that kind of hired manual people.

719
00:55:06,539 --> 00:55:10,581
temporary writing things is not always...

720
00:55:10,581 --> 00:55:14,223
not going to... Finally, the developing team have to take care of that.

721
00:55:14,223 --> 00:55:16,104
I knew that, so I start from the writing.

722
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:19,065
Even far before the game was completed.

723
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:24,168
So, the manual was kind of a spec sheet to the development team, almost.

724
00:55:24,168 --> 00:55:26,809
Yeah, no, that's the interesting...

725
00:55:26,809 --> 00:55:31,431
Manual, that adds to the game. It's not explaining it.

726
00:55:31,431 --> 00:55:34,573
The controls is just, yeah, telling more. So, yeah.

727
00:55:34,573 --> 00:55:35,853
Thank you.

728
00:55:37,589 --> 00:55:45,572
A lot of things that today call themselves AI seem much, much, much dumber than C-Man

729
00:55:45,572 --> 00:55:47,073
seemed then.

730
00:55:47,073 --> 00:55:51,335
So I think you did an incredible job of simulating intelligence.

731
00:55:51,335 --> 00:55:58,918
And to follow up on the very first question, which asked about how you created all of the

732
00:55:58,918 --> 00:55:59,898
unique responses.

733
00:56:00,499 --> 00:56:11,906
Could you give us some idea of how many total unique responses you created in order to simulate that intelligence?

734
00:56:11,906 --> 00:56:20,972
Yeah, actually the first version of Simon is not AI at all. That was a massive

735
00:56:20,972 --> 00:56:26,235
writing, you know, written materials did it and

736
00:56:26,235 --> 00:56:27,236
the number of the folk

737
00:56:28,751 --> 00:56:31,893
I was uncountable in...

738
00:56:31,893 --> 00:56:33,034
Thousands?

739
00:56:33,034 --> 00:56:34,475
I know much more.

740
00:56:34,475 --> 00:56:35,435
Tens of thousands?

741
00:56:35,435 --> 00:56:43,041
I don't know, at least the number of the jobs

742
00:56:43,041 --> 00:56:47,143
is more than 200, so the combination of those kind of

743
00:56:47,143 --> 00:56:49,885
things, I don't know, it's uncountable.

744
00:56:49,885 --> 00:56:56,470
But the cement is one of the...

745
00:56:57,762 --> 00:57:01,003
the job that only young guys can do.

746
00:57:01,003 --> 00:57:05,705
So now I need AI, because I'm so much younger than them.

747
00:57:05,705 --> 00:57:13,648
But the response is, actually, English version

748
00:57:13,648 --> 00:57:15,888
is it was done by somebody else.

749
00:57:15,888 --> 00:57:18,469
I mean, American people.

750
00:57:18,469 --> 00:57:23,051
So I'm not so much familiar with the American version.

751
00:57:23,051 --> 00:57:26,092
But in Japanese version, yeah, we

752
00:57:26,092 --> 00:57:27,512
did put a lot of.

753
00:57:29,507 --> 00:57:32,849
I wonder how to say it in Japanese.

754
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:37,371
I want you to translate it in a short term.

755
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:39,412
When you said something,

756
00:57:39,412 --> 00:57:41,113
you were doing voice acting,

757
00:57:41,113 --> 00:57:44,454
and you were able to do a lot of interesting things.

758
00:57:44,454 --> 00:57:47,436
You were able to do a lot of interesting things.

759
00:57:47,436 --> 00:57:50,297
You were doing voice acting, and you were doing writing,

760
00:57:50,297 --> 00:57:52,078
so you were able to do a lot of pranks.

761
00:57:52,698 --> 00:58:02,065
It was so much more, I guess, I had the pleasure and leisure to kind of like play around, play tricks, fool around.

762
00:58:02,065 --> 00:58:05,929
So it was just basically like a banter with myself.

763
00:58:05,929 --> 00:58:12,174
And that led to new discoveries in so many different scenarios.

764
00:58:12,174 --> 00:58:13,895
Thank you.

765
00:58:13,895 --> 00:58:13,975
Hi.

766
00:58:13,975 --> 00:58:15,516
Hello.

767
00:58:15,516 --> 00:58:16,657
Quick question.

768
00:58:16,998 --> 00:58:24,083
Do you plan on creating more strange games like Seaman, or to bring back Seaman in some shape or form?

769
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:31,288
For these five years I've been out of the game industry for very private reasons.

770
00:58:31,288 --> 00:58:33,750
And I think I'm coming back.

771
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:41,295
And for these years, what I have been doing was something to create a kind of AI.

772
00:58:41,295 --> 00:58:43,136
It's not a game, it's a kind of R&D.

773
00:58:44,378 --> 00:58:49,421
And so now I started thinking about a new game

774
00:58:49,421 --> 00:58:50,942
and it's gonna be very strange.

775
00:58:50,942 --> 00:58:52,623
I mean, it's...

776
00:58:52,623 --> 00:58:52,923
Perfect.

777
00:58:52,923 --> 00:58:56,586
It will be like very unexisting.

778
00:58:56,586 --> 00:59:01,328
And I just started on that with a publisher in Japan.

779
00:59:01,328 --> 00:59:03,530
I can't tell you that well, but...

780
00:59:03,530 --> 00:59:04,510
Awesome.

781
00:59:04,510 --> 00:59:06,851
It's a little bit related to Bitcoin.

782
00:59:06,851 --> 00:59:07,072
Okay.

783
00:59:07,072 --> 00:59:12,115
It's something like mining your own gold

784
00:59:12,115 --> 00:59:13,375
and make your own...

785
00:59:14,122 --> 00:59:23,248
money. Interesting. Yeah, we're using blockchain technologies. Yeah, that's almost everything.

786
00:59:23,248 --> 00:59:30,214
Thank you. On that note, it's just at three o'clock right now, so I think that's going to

787
00:59:30,214 --> 00:59:34,057
be it for us today. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
