1
00:00:06,693 --> 00:00:07,514
Oh, don't clap yet.

2
00:00:11,237 --> 00:00:11,577
Hello.

3
00:00:11,597 --> 00:00:13,579
Yeah, my name's Sean.

4
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:15,981
I work at a studio called Campo Santo.

5
00:00:18,398 --> 00:00:19,839
Hold on, I have no presenter notes.

6
00:00:20,379 --> 00:00:22,541
And I'll just stand here in silence for 25 minutes.

7
00:00:22,962 --> 00:00:23,122
Cool.

8
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:26,585
And before that, I worked at Telltale Games.

9
00:00:27,225 --> 00:00:29,187
And while I was there, I was lucky enough

10
00:00:29,227 --> 00:00:31,088
to work on games like Tales of Monkey Island,

11
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:34,151
Poker Night at the Inventory, personal favorite of mine,

12
00:00:35,031 --> 00:00:38,574
Nelson Tether's Puzzle Agent, and The Walking Dead Season 1.

13
00:00:41,094 --> 00:00:46,657
And yeah, so I'm currently working on a game called Firewatch with everyone at Campo Santo.

14
00:00:47,558 --> 00:00:49,959
And it's a first-person adventure type of thing.

15
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:54,102
And the game's core focus is the relationship between a man and a woman.

16
00:00:54,923 --> 00:00:56,784
And it's in isolation, sorry.

17
00:00:57,004 --> 00:00:58,465
So I can talk about that more in a little bit.

18
00:00:58,485 --> 00:01:00,546
We're going to talk about some of the challenges we're facing.

19
00:01:02,207 --> 00:01:06,530
But even though all these games are very different experiences, I kind of believe they're all

20
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:07,531
after the same thing.

21
00:01:08,191 --> 00:01:10,593
And they kind of focus on a few narrative concepts.

22
00:01:12,687 --> 00:01:15,808
One is character interaction with realistic, believable dialogue.

23
00:01:16,688 --> 00:01:20,870
Also stories and anecdotes the player can discover and impact in a meaningful way.

24
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:23,531
And interaction systems

25
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:27,592
that pay attention to what the player is doing and the choices they're making.

26
00:01:28,413 --> 00:01:29,673
And looking over all these games

27
00:01:30,614 --> 00:01:33,455
that I've been lucky enough to work on, the most recent being The Walking Dead,

28
00:01:33,475 --> 00:01:36,476
I see that these concepts are all working towards a common goal.

29
00:01:37,076 --> 00:01:39,757
And that would be the title of the talk, the suspension of disbelief.

30
00:01:41,608 --> 00:01:46,430
There's been a sort of concerted effort on the part of these games to presuppose that

31
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:51,453
they're not games or puzzles or whatever, that they're simply experiences.

32
00:01:51,773 --> 00:01:54,734
They're meant to entertain, provoke, and surprise.

33
00:01:55,735 --> 00:01:59,697
And I think if you're trying to make a piece of fiction about people, that the suspension

34
00:01:59,717 --> 00:02:04,019
of disbelief is really one of the most important things to consider in your design.

35
00:02:05,088 --> 00:02:06,868
So for a quick turn to Wikipedia,

36
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:12,229
the phrase was coined in 1817 by a poet-philosopher,

37
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:17,031
hypochondriac, opium addict, and cravat enthusiast,

38
00:02:17,651 --> 00:02:20,071
Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who suggested

39
00:02:20,131 --> 00:02:24,352
that by being sure to anchor an otherwise impossible tale

40
00:02:24,752 --> 00:02:26,873
in elements of the human experience,

41
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:29,794
readers would suspend their judgment of the fantasy

42
00:02:30,254 --> 00:02:31,654
and experience it for its drama.

43
00:02:32,692 --> 00:02:36,034
So Coleridge was working during a time of the enlightenment, when people had begun

44
00:02:36,054 --> 00:02:42,458
to stop believing in things like witches, ghosts, and specters in their everyday lives.

45
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:49,302
So consequently, these absurdities had fallen out of vogue in popular works.

46
00:02:50,607 --> 00:02:52,608
The suspension of disbelief as a tool for the author

47
00:02:53,228 --> 00:02:55,208
became a way for these very powerful images

48
00:02:55,568 --> 00:02:57,829
to bridge the gap between what was popularly believed

49
00:02:58,449 --> 00:03:00,709
and the thematic meanings the images could bring with them,

50
00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:03,610
such as the spirits that Coleridge himself employs

51
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,630
in his poem, The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.

52
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:09,711
The audience could see past their disbelief

53
00:03:10,311 --> 00:03:12,452
of the supernatural if they were actually being told

54
00:03:12,472 --> 00:03:13,672
a story about people.

55
00:03:14,572 --> 00:03:17,453
It was the author's job to assure that that was the case.

56
00:03:19,092 --> 00:03:23,197
Now we jump forward to the age of cinema, and it seems as if the onus of the suspension

57
00:03:23,217 --> 00:03:25,720
of disbelief has sort of transferred to the audience.

58
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:30,886
For the audience to really engage in the human elements of a story, they are the ones that

59
00:03:30,926 --> 00:03:36,272
are asked to take the supernatural at face value, to ignore the artifice, and to suss

60
00:03:36,332 --> 00:03:37,693
out the meaningful parts of the story.

61
00:03:38,522 --> 00:03:40,822
The truth, I mean the same is often really said about video games,

62
00:03:41,563 --> 00:03:46,204
just ignore certain aspects of the system or the gameplay or the dialogue or the very premise itself

63
00:03:46,705 --> 00:03:50,006
and it's there you're going to find enjoyment and meaning and value.

64
00:03:51,226 --> 00:03:52,847
Like I'm not saying you should take this literally,

65
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:59,469
like I'm not suggesting that we make like hyper immersive like completely real simulations

66
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:02,150
where the audience actually believes this is happening

67
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:07,132
and therefore they feel the feelings that are inside the text.

68
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:15,000
What I'm saying is that, with Coleridge, I reject the notion that the player should have to ignore certain aspects of the experience

69
00:04:15,981 --> 00:04:18,301
just to find value in the narrative or to connect to the story.

70
00:04:18,321 --> 00:04:21,342
And if you're going to make games where the narrative matters,

71
00:04:22,102 --> 00:04:28,283
then I think it's the job of the people in this room to communicate to the player through design and focus on the human experience.

72
00:04:29,363 --> 00:04:32,484
That the game the player is sat down to is worth engaging with emotionally,

73
00:04:32,904 --> 00:04:35,185
and not just take for granted that the player actually should.

74
00:04:36,217 --> 00:04:41,481
So Jake Rodkin, who's Campo Santo's co-founder, and I have described video game design in

75
00:04:41,501 --> 00:04:43,883
this method as like going on a date with a player.

76
00:04:44,523 --> 00:04:49,247
Like the player is at the table with you, and for the date to go really well, you have

77
00:04:49,267 --> 00:04:53,890
to listen to what that person is saying, or what that person is expressing, and then respond

78
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:59,274
with a mix of comfortably predictable and excitingly surprising ways.

79
00:05:00,294 --> 00:05:02,636
Gabe Newell has referred to Valve's sort of design

80
00:05:03,376 --> 00:05:05,618
and marketing philosophy as a dance with the audience.

81
00:05:06,418 --> 00:05:08,600
Valve's going to take the first step, like they're going to put the game out,

82
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,622
or design the IP, or the system, or the backend, or whatever.

83
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,403
And it's the player that will then

84
00:05:14,343 --> 00:05:15,524
sort of find meaning in it,

85
00:05:15,844 --> 00:05:18,886
contribute to it through play, or oftentimes even like an asset creation,

86
00:05:19,367 --> 00:05:20,828
and then the company has to respond.

87
00:05:21,608 --> 00:05:22,609
So this understanding that

88
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:24,550
you're dancing with the player I think is

89
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:27,952
key in creating an interactive piece that suspends the audience disbelief.

90
00:05:29,927 --> 00:05:33,849
So I quickly want to look at The Walking Dead and think about how we sort of did with that.

91
00:05:33,869 --> 00:05:39,931
And I think we set out to strip away things from the classic adventure game that forced

92
00:05:39,951 --> 00:05:41,091
you to consider its structure.

93
00:05:41,951 --> 00:05:47,593
And we really wanted to replace that with character interactions that drove the entire

94
00:05:47,733 --> 00:05:48,574
experience forward.

95
00:05:49,014 --> 00:05:53,295
We wanted the players to be a participant, not an all-powerful entity, because we felt

96
00:05:53,315 --> 00:05:57,177
that was appropriate for the property and was just sort of interesting to us as designers.

97
00:05:59,135 --> 00:06:04,778
So when we consider these narrative concepts, character interactions, dynamically discovered

98
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:08,701
story and player-aware interaction systems, we feel like The Walking Dead actually did

99
00:06:08,721 --> 00:06:09,101
pretty good.

100
00:06:10,382 --> 00:06:14,345
We came at the game with certain assumptions about adventure games, that dialogue trees

101
00:06:14,385 --> 00:06:18,648
were static, that storylines didn't change, and said, well, what if they did?

102
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:22,090
And what if you don't answer and the game just keeps going on?

103
00:06:22,991 --> 00:06:25,012
And also, what if players have radically different outcomes?

104
00:06:25,868 --> 00:06:30,556
And I feel like the game enabled most gamers to see past the artifice of the experience

105
00:06:31,277 --> 00:06:36,486
and just sort of consider it not as a game, but as a human story experience, even if only

106
00:06:36,546 --> 00:06:37,467
for a few minutes here and there.

107
00:06:40,546 --> 00:06:41,347
Where does the game fail?

108
00:06:41,967 --> 00:06:46,030
Firstly, I think I could have, and a bit of the writing

109
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,132
in general, could have structured the dialogue

110
00:06:48,953 --> 00:06:50,814
responses throughout the game to be more responsive.

111
00:06:51,475 --> 00:06:53,116
Whenever the game is obviously responding

112
00:06:53,136 --> 00:06:54,657
to a choice you're making, it feels

113
00:06:54,677 --> 00:06:55,878
like it's really succeeding.

114
00:06:56,379 --> 00:07:00,362
But there are times when, either through scope or personal

115
00:07:00,382 --> 00:07:03,565
laziness, that the game feels like it's just feeding you

116
00:07:03,665 --> 00:07:04,625
core story content.

117
00:07:05,186 --> 00:07:08,228
And then you can see the player's eyes glass over,

118
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:09,389
because they're experiencing.

119
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,273
A story, but they're not experiencing their story.

120
00:07:13,594 --> 00:07:16,198
And I also think the game falls down to the use of quick time events,

121
00:07:16,318 --> 00:07:18,040
which we all, unfortunately, know

122
00:07:18,701 --> 00:07:20,564
seem to be really way too often employed

123
00:07:20,884 --> 00:07:22,025
in games with narrative focus.

124
00:07:23,247 --> 00:07:24,188
But I do want to talk about those.

125
00:07:25,163 --> 00:07:28,164
Because when I was considering failures for The Walking Dead for this talk,

126
00:07:28,725 --> 00:07:30,205
like, it's obvious, like the first thing I wrote down.

127
00:07:30,765 --> 00:07:34,526
But then I think the reason that quicktime events are universally maligned

128
00:07:35,327 --> 00:07:37,347
isn't because of something inherent to their design,

129
00:07:37,627 --> 00:07:38,748
I think it's because of their misuse.

130
00:07:39,248 --> 00:07:40,928
So I'm gonna, like, look at a couple of examples.

131
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:44,889
So, here, hopefully this works. Yeah. Cool.

132
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:49,811
The player has been startled by a zombie during their first conversation with Clementine.

133
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:54,900
And it's like jarring and disorienting.

134
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,382
And it's a situation where Lee will escape with the skin of

135
00:07:57,422 --> 00:07:59,523
his teeth, but it's totally OK if you die.

136
00:08:00,103 --> 00:08:00,924
You're going to get better at it.

137
00:08:01,364 --> 00:08:03,925
It's a mix of mashing and grabbing and object use, most

138
00:08:03,945 --> 00:08:05,106
of which are tied to the game's core

139
00:08:05,146 --> 00:08:06,447
mechanic, the reticle.

140
00:08:07,047 --> 00:08:09,949
So the player's going to use that to go on to select basic

141
00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:11,489
objects, shoot guns, and open doors.

142
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,491
It's disorienting in a forgiving way, and also

143
00:08:14,511 --> 00:08:16,732
teaches the player to become more proficient at the game's

144
00:08:16,832 --> 00:08:18,613
core mechanic, pointing and clicking.

145
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:23,511
And then later, oop, did that work? Go!

146
00:08:24,832 --> 00:08:25,593
Maybe it'll work. Okay.

147
00:08:25,933 --> 00:08:29,615
We subvert the QuickTime event in a fight with a stranger.

148
00:08:29,815 --> 00:08:33,957
We drop the UI from the screen, and we actually let the player continue to choke a man to death if they choose.

149
00:08:35,018 --> 00:08:37,500
We also utilize QuickTime events when you're supposed to fail.

150
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:43,203
Trying to open a shuttered door, or even just trying to stand as you're moments away from dying.

151
00:08:43,383 --> 00:08:45,844
And there's like this emotionally, and I think that's really emotionally effective.

152
00:08:46,871 --> 00:08:48,753
We're doing our best, given the systems of the game,

153
00:08:49,093 --> 00:08:51,235
to share with the player Lee's ever-increasing lack of power.

154
00:08:52,736 --> 00:08:54,018
However, we also started using them,

155
00:08:55,239 --> 00:08:56,860
namely, just like button presses and mashes,

156
00:08:57,361 --> 00:08:58,181
like really broadly.

157
00:08:58,462 --> 00:08:59,703
Press X to dodge and like,

158
00:09:00,504 --> 00:09:02,666
excuse me, press B to open a thing.

159
00:09:03,306 --> 00:09:05,208
And those, I found, sort of gamify the experience.

160
00:09:05,668 --> 00:09:06,389
And they don't serve

161
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:08,551
to continue that dance with the player.

162
00:09:09,431 --> 00:09:10,672
It's like stepping on the player's foot.

163
00:09:11,292 --> 00:09:13,313
Like, you both stumble, like literally look down

164
00:09:14,073 --> 00:09:16,094
and to see what's happening at the controller level.

165
00:09:16,394 --> 00:09:17,575
And like, we try to course correct

166
00:09:18,155 --> 00:09:20,176
and then you have to spend a bunch of time and mental energy

167
00:09:20,736 --> 00:09:21,937
to get back in time with the music

168
00:09:21,977 --> 00:09:23,438
and getting back in time with the tone of the story.

169
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:26,639
Like, essentially, QTEs are not the problem.

170
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,201
It's like how, when, and why they are written into the game

171
00:09:30,601 --> 00:09:33,263
and how they impact the overall tonal consistency of the experience.

172
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,201
So I want to talk for a second about tonal inconsistency.

173
00:09:36,921 --> 00:09:39,622
It's an incredibly important concept to the suspension of disbelief.

174
00:09:40,522 --> 00:09:41,742
And I don't want to go too far in the weeds on that.

175
00:09:41,762 --> 00:09:45,043
I would point you towards, like, Clint Hawking's talks at GDC before.

176
00:09:46,223 --> 00:09:48,564
Steve Gannard has a podcast called Tone Control that I think is very good.

177
00:09:49,224 --> 00:09:50,484
And if you want to go into that.

178
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:54,645
But like anything else, you have to consider your writing

179
00:09:55,425 --> 00:09:57,466
and the narrative as a consistent piece of the whole.

180
00:09:58,246 --> 00:09:59,646
And make sure that at every level

181
00:10:00,327 --> 00:10:02,647
it's working towards the creation of a cohesive experience.

182
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:05,871
My argument is that sometimes QuickTime events actually do that,

183
00:10:06,332 --> 00:10:07,372
but used broadly, they won't.

184
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:12,376
The issue is usually that QTEs destroy the mechanical cohesiveness of the game,

185
00:10:12,476 --> 00:10:14,837
in turn obliterating the player's suspension of disbelief

186
00:10:15,098 --> 00:10:18,840
and undercutting the importance of the game's story in the player's mind along with it.

187
00:10:20,902 --> 00:10:24,064
So, tonal consistency through theme and mechanic is one of our chief concerns

188
00:10:24,204 --> 00:10:26,145
on the game we're working on, Firewatch at Campo Santo.

189
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:31,956
Again, you play as a man named Henry who's retreated from his sort of like messy life

190
00:10:32,396 --> 00:10:35,460
to be a fire lookout for the summer in the Absaroka wilderness in Wyoming.

191
00:10:36,201 --> 00:10:39,685
And while doing the job, you build a relationship with your superior, a woman named Delilah,

192
00:10:40,046 --> 00:10:41,948
whom you talk to exclusively over handheld radio.

193
00:10:42,489 --> 00:10:44,131
But on your first day, like something weird happens.

194
00:10:45,146 --> 00:10:48,729
and you have to go out of your tower and then you go out into the world.

195
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:51,452
And through environmental exploration and sort of narrative choice,

196
00:10:52,013 --> 00:10:55,376
you learn to inhabit Henry and build a relationship with Delilah.

197
00:10:56,617 --> 00:10:59,600
We're super early, so names and things might change,

198
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,822
but hopefully not because we keep saying them.

199
00:11:01,922 --> 00:11:03,423
But we'll see.

200
00:11:04,985 --> 00:11:06,687
But it's a first-person story experience.

201
00:11:07,507 --> 00:11:11,208
And most games like this would put a voice in your ear and expect you to follow it.

202
00:11:11,308 --> 00:11:11,768
And we do.

203
00:11:11,788 --> 00:11:14,029
We just thought it would be interesting if you could talk back.

204
00:11:14,289 --> 00:11:15,129
So in this game, you can.

205
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:21,111
A large personal goal for the project is to suspend disbelief, obviously,

206
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:24,792
in order for folks to see past the artifice of the game

207
00:11:24,832 --> 00:11:27,033
and feel like they're having a real conversation with Delilah.

208
00:11:29,024 --> 00:11:31,406
If players feel like they're having real conversations, and like,

209
00:11:31,806 --> 00:11:33,467
that's great, like goal number one checked off,

210
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,970
then the next one is for folks to feel like they're building

211
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:38,291
a relationship with her.

212
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:41,513
And if we can do those two things, and hopefully we've created a game

213
00:11:41,553 --> 00:11:43,775
where the player feels totally in control of the action,

214
00:11:44,615 --> 00:11:47,998
and they're pushing and pulling on the emotional aspects of the story in a world

215
00:11:48,438 --> 00:11:49,699
that is responsive and fulfilling,

216
00:11:50,179 --> 00:11:51,640
like that's the entire goal of the project.

217
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:58,086
It's weird to be talking about the goals of a project when you're just like always anxious about making it.

218
00:11:58,146 --> 00:11:59,767
Like, I've never done this before. It's strange.

219
00:12:02,028 --> 00:12:05,249
To that end, what are some of the things that can stop us from achieving that goal?

220
00:12:06,349 --> 00:12:06,849
I have a lot.

221
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:10,590
Poorly written dialogue. Being unresponsive to player choice.

222
00:12:11,271 --> 00:12:13,651
I'm just going to go through them. Poor voice acting is a good one.

223
00:12:14,612 --> 00:12:17,873
Checkpoints, missions, arbitrary game elements, such as these.

224
00:12:19,433 --> 00:12:21,014
The list goes on and on.

225
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,332
Poor density of world interactions is a big one.

226
00:12:24,733 --> 00:12:25,734
Unresponsive world state.

227
00:12:26,155 --> 00:12:28,297
Repetitive dialogue, interface tutorials, and UI.

228
00:12:28,578 --> 00:12:29,979
Failing to pursue empathetic characters.

229
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,181
It just...

230
00:12:31,681 --> 00:12:34,665
The list of things that will stop us from succeeding seems infinite.

231
00:12:36,105 --> 00:12:39,548
But some of these things are actually avoidable through just like execution.

232
00:12:39,568 --> 00:12:43,211
That's just like talented people doing their jobs well, which is kind of hard to comment

233
00:12:43,311 --> 00:12:43,411
on.

234
00:12:43,952 --> 00:12:45,573
But other things are solved through game design.

235
00:12:45,593 --> 00:12:51,418
And then some of these things though are solved not just through writing, a form of execution,

236
00:12:51,718 --> 00:12:52,659
but how we write.

237
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:57,963
And when I talk about how we write, I'm talking about sort of the principles we use when writing

238
00:12:58,003 --> 00:13:01,906
dialogue in addition to the tools we develop to organize and implement the stuff that we're

239
00:13:01,926 --> 00:13:02,246
going to make.

240
00:13:03,447 --> 00:13:05,648
Because one of the things I personally remember

241
00:13:06,189 --> 00:13:08,710
when I'm either at any stage of development

242
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:11,872
is that nobody really cares about writing,

243
00:13:12,152 --> 00:13:13,032
like in the traditional sense.

244
00:13:13,733 --> 00:13:16,774
People just don't recognize objectively strong dialogue

245
00:13:17,295 --> 00:13:18,836
if it's presented to them statically,

246
00:13:19,016 --> 00:13:20,356
or in a laborious cut scene,

247
00:13:20,757 --> 00:13:22,437
or in a really obviously linear way.

248
00:13:23,518 --> 00:13:25,239
But if you let the player make a choice

249
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:27,320
to deliver a particularly well-written line,

250
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,601
then we're often told the writing's really good.

251
00:13:31,391 --> 00:13:33,052
That line, the exact same line,

252
00:13:33,492 --> 00:13:36,793
tucked into like an expertly crafted 90 second cutscene,

253
00:13:37,173 --> 00:13:38,894
gets completely dismissed if it's ever seen at all,

254
00:13:39,214 --> 00:13:41,095
because the player just feels like they're not moving forward.

255
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:45,677
So, um...

256
00:13:46,838 --> 00:13:49,499
It's the writing's job to either not infringe on gameplay or actually be gameplay.

257
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:51,059
This is one of the first things we prototyped.

258
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,861
Check out that exclusive reveal of garbage!

259
00:13:54,881 --> 00:13:55,401
But, uh...

260
00:13:57,838 --> 00:14:00,299
Because the game we're working on is in first person, and it's an ideal world.

261
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,180
We'd absolutely never take control away from the player.

262
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,401
We need tools, and again these principles,

263
00:14:05,361 --> 00:14:07,482
to interrupt dialogue in a realistic way.

264
00:14:07,502 --> 00:14:10,543
Because you can walk around with this thing that makes people talk.

265
00:14:12,584 --> 00:14:16,325
So for instance, let's say like

266
00:14:16,405 --> 00:14:18,766
Henry and Delilah are out, and you're talking about

267
00:14:19,606 --> 00:14:20,887
a windstorm that happened last night.

268
00:14:21,287 --> 00:14:24,328
Because dialogue about weather is like a surefire way to be super successful.

269
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:31,329
But mid-conversation, the player discovers a necklace of human fingers on the ground.

270
00:14:31,629 --> 00:14:33,470
That's not in the game, actually. Shit. Sorry.

271
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:36,971
It occurred to me that if I put that in two seconds ago,

272
00:14:36,991 --> 00:14:38,512
people might think you could find that in this game.

273
00:14:38,632 --> 00:14:40,353
I'm just suggesting that as a weird thing.

274
00:14:41,494 --> 00:14:42,994
There's no necklace of human fingers in this game.

275
00:14:43,575 --> 00:14:45,816
Furthermore, I googled that to put it into the talk,

276
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:48,997
and then I realized that if I showed people what I found,

277
00:14:49,157 --> 00:14:50,658
somebody would be sick and barf.

278
00:14:50,718 --> 00:14:53,960
So you get to look at a picture that Ollie drew instead.

279
00:14:56,045 --> 00:15:01,572
Anyway, you find this necklace of human fingers.

280
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:05,736
Henry better say, like, whoa, there's some finger jewelry here.

281
00:15:05,756 --> 00:15:06,637
Holy shit.

282
00:15:06,878 --> 00:15:10,201
And stop talking about the wind, because this has now

283
00:15:10,241 --> 00:15:11,903
become much more important.

284
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:17,257
We have to interrupt the dialogue naturally, and that's like really scary to do.

285
00:15:18,778 --> 00:15:23,062
So it means that I, it actually means things for how I write the dialogue.

286
00:15:23,742 --> 00:15:27,345
It means I can't write super lengthy lines that we need to finish in order to be interrupted

287
00:15:27,365 --> 00:15:28,146
in natural fashion.

288
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:32,469
I need to be able to time the new dialogue to interrupt in concordance with the thing

289
00:15:32,489 --> 00:15:33,510
that the player has just found.

290
00:15:35,172 --> 00:15:37,754
Or if it's even just like on screen, whatever event has triggered that.

291
00:15:39,362 --> 00:15:44,165
We need all the dialogue to exist in an organized and discrete chunk so it can be rearranged.

292
00:15:44,705 --> 00:15:47,827
The speech manager needs to know exactly what's happening in the game at all times.

293
00:15:48,487 --> 00:15:51,269
And sometimes the cone of the conversation actually needs to change.

294
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:53,231
So...

295
00:15:54,538 --> 00:15:57,659
Like, I have to write short, snappy, back-and-forth dialogue,

296
00:15:57,719 --> 00:16:01,040
and I have to save longer monologues for times when I know stuff can't happen,

297
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:01,861
which is super rare.

298
00:16:02,521 --> 00:16:04,621
And then I actually voice direct lines in tight concordance

299
00:16:04,641 --> 00:16:06,822
with the possible, like, tones of the story,

300
00:16:07,002 --> 00:16:08,483
sometimes duplicating conversations,

301
00:16:09,103 --> 00:16:10,243
pre- and post-a-specific event.

302
00:16:11,784 --> 00:16:13,944
But the thing that allows any of this to work

303
00:16:13,964 --> 00:16:16,185
is the system and methodologies used to organize

304
00:16:16,905 --> 00:16:17,785
the written content of the game.

305
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:22,879
So we actually took major cues from Elon Ruskin's 2012 GDC talk

306
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,760
about Val's dialogue system.

307
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,621
There are aspects of it that don't quite work for our game

308
00:16:27,662 --> 00:16:29,582
because it's really dialogue choice heavy.

309
00:16:29,602 --> 00:16:33,324
Excuse me, but the principles he outlines in the talk

310
00:16:33,704 --> 00:16:35,365
are like, which is available outside of the vault.

311
00:16:35,385 --> 00:16:36,125
You can just go find it.

312
00:16:36,145 --> 00:16:39,687
They've been like an invaluable cornerstone

313
00:16:39,987 --> 00:16:41,228
to the thing that we're trying to build.

314
00:16:42,548 --> 00:16:43,849
So yeah, I'll share with you where we're at

315
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:44,909
and the problems we're considering

316
00:16:44,929 --> 00:16:46,670
and some of the ways we're thinking about solving them.

317
00:16:48,151 --> 00:16:51,213
To really oversimplify the process, you should just really go watch the talk.

318
00:16:52,014 --> 00:16:54,756
Each of the lines is triggered by a singular event

319
00:16:55,156 --> 00:16:59,599
and is aware via appropriate context at what point in the game it's allowed to be triggered.

320
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:04,503
The dialogue system and the event manager work together to find the most pertinent line in the database

321
00:17:05,003 --> 00:17:07,085
and deliver it to the player at the most appropriate time.

322
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:11,411
So we want to vary user-friendly.

323
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:14,274
Because I guess I'm the user and I'm an idiot.

324
00:17:14,414 --> 00:17:16,255
So I need to have a very user-friendly way

325
00:17:16,295 --> 00:17:19,138
to generate and organize dialogue contents and story

326
00:17:19,158 --> 00:17:19,418
moments.

327
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:22,061
Because Firewatch is not procedural.

328
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:25,443
It's more systems-driven than some of the things

329
00:17:25,524 --> 00:17:26,204
we've ever worked on.

330
00:17:26,404 --> 00:17:29,027
But it's not procedural at all.

331
00:17:29,067 --> 00:17:29,827
It's not a puzzle game.

332
00:17:29,867 --> 00:17:31,729
Like, content isn't being generated by a robot.

333
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,891
The game is going to rely on lots of.

334
00:17:34,802 --> 00:17:37,683
Responsive content succeed, and we're a super small team,

335
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:40,444
so we have to be able to generate that and implement it really quickly.

336
00:17:40,464 --> 00:17:42,725
And we've established goals for how I write,

337
00:17:43,085 --> 00:17:44,566
and now we're developing this tool to help me get there.

338
00:17:45,846 --> 00:17:48,727
For now, I work in a relatively free-form way,

339
00:17:49,227 --> 00:17:50,808
and then chop up the individual lines

340
00:17:52,068 --> 00:17:53,008
so they can be put into a database.

341
00:17:53,609 --> 00:17:56,650
And right now, Patrick Ewing, who's a programmer we're working with at Campo Santo,

342
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:59,131
and I are trying to flatten the process

343
00:18:00,651 --> 00:18:03,692
from written dialogue line to implementation in a database into the game.

344
00:18:04,746 --> 00:18:07,467
So to put it as simply as possible, we're trying to consider

345
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:10,788
what are the fewest amounts of button presses it takes

346
00:18:11,248 --> 00:18:14,249
to write a line, store all of its logic and data,

347
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:17,089
record it, implement it, and tinker with the timing

348
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:17,990
to ship in the final game.

349
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,550
We're trying to solve this really complex problem

350
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:23,131
which is compounded by a realization that we both had

351
00:18:23,891 --> 00:18:27,052
which is how these tools work is gonna dictate

352
00:18:28,032 --> 00:18:29,973
what comes out of the screen, not just the pipeline.

353
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,604
It means fundamental things to the nature of the game's cadence and tone, the dialogue itself.

354
00:18:36,585 --> 00:18:39,587
So if we're going to choose to develop a system predicated on world state

355
00:18:40,288 --> 00:18:43,751
and the possibility of interruption and to respond to lots of different player inputs

356
00:18:44,011 --> 00:18:47,894
and the content we feed that system, the actual writing has to be compatible.

357
00:18:48,515 --> 00:18:52,098
Every choice we make about how the tool works alongside the game's systems

358
00:18:52,418 --> 00:18:54,540
impacts what we're able to put into the system

359
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,661
and therefore what we're able to push out of the screen.

360
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:01,281
Because it's worth, like again, we need to make as much of it as possible.

361
00:19:01,901 --> 00:19:05,143
In this game you're going to be talking to someone over a radio as you explore.

362
00:19:05,163 --> 00:19:10,526
In most games, when you write dialogue, you know a character is going to be in a certain place at a certain time.

363
00:19:10,787 --> 00:19:13,168
You literally bring a character with you anywhere.

364
00:19:13,808 --> 00:19:15,029
So the dialogue has to reflect that.

365
00:19:15,449 --> 00:19:18,151
And to do that, we need like, just a shitload of it.

366
00:19:20,143 --> 00:19:24,386
So we struggle to consider flexibility against agility.

367
00:19:24,726 --> 00:19:27,687
How feature-rich do we make the front end of a tool

368
00:19:27,727 --> 00:19:30,469
versus how good is it at making the exact game we're

369
00:19:30,489 --> 00:19:31,089
trying to make?

370
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:33,370
We err towards the latter, obviously.

371
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:35,431
We need to make this one game.

372
00:19:35,931 --> 00:19:38,353
But it's an inescapable lure to think, well, what if the

373
00:19:38,393 --> 00:19:38,993
tool could?

374
00:19:39,493 --> 00:19:40,594
It doesn't just take time to build.

375
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:45,496
But that moment of wondering, well, what if the tool also

376
00:19:45,536 --> 00:19:48,578
let us, is going to impact the game we make, the actual

377
00:19:48,618 --> 00:19:48,918
content.

378
00:19:50,383 --> 00:19:52,925
If you give a craftsperson a brush versus a pencil,

379
00:19:52,945 --> 00:19:54,506
you're going to get two very different images.

380
00:19:55,067 --> 00:19:56,107
And at the most basic level,

381
00:19:57,188 --> 00:19:58,089
all we really need to do

382
00:19:58,729 --> 00:20:01,992
is write down and store a bunch of data in a database.

383
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:03,633
It's like we could easily use Excel.

384
00:20:03,653 --> 00:20:06,254
We could just organize a bunch of lines

385
00:20:06,855 --> 00:20:07,655
as individual events.

386
00:20:07,675 --> 00:20:09,357
So when the player does X,

387
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,778
or world state is Y, we just make thing happen.

388
00:20:14,299 --> 00:20:17,842
So, what we've settled on thus far is creating a very simple interface

389
00:20:18,242 --> 00:20:20,665
that has as much searchability as possible.

390
00:20:21,365 --> 00:20:24,909
Because we want to be able to look at a line in a tool and give it a bunch of new requirements on the fly.

391
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:29,113
Requirements is the stuff that says, oh, I can happen when this is true.

392
00:20:29,834 --> 00:20:33,717
Furthermore, we know we can take a big bite out of the polishing phase of the game.

393
00:20:34,298 --> 00:20:37,301
So it would be amazing if we could actually tune the timing of the dialogue right in the tool.

394
00:20:38,983 --> 00:20:40,924
I focus on a couple of core features like this.

395
00:20:40,944 --> 00:20:44,268
It's going to help us debug quickly and shift the dialogue faster.

396
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:49,252
But I want to point out that decisions to create and deliver content in a certain way,

397
00:20:49,573 --> 00:20:53,417
to build a certain tool, actually help us combat the hurdles that stand in the way to

398
00:20:53,457 --> 00:20:55,599
creating suspension of disbelief that I mentioned before.

399
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,962
Long cutscenes start to go away because of our methodology.

400
00:20:59,622 --> 00:21:01,785
Bad dialogue timing can hopefully be solved right in the tool.

401
00:21:02,777 --> 00:21:04,419
We can respond to player choice more deftly,

402
00:21:04,439 --> 00:21:06,541
and we're trying to flatten the content pipeline.

403
00:21:07,022 --> 00:21:09,965
The same goes for interactions, story, and cutscene density.

404
00:21:13,032 --> 00:21:17,936
As lots of people have always said, game writing is game design.

405
00:21:18,257 --> 00:21:19,038
It's level design.

406
00:21:19,538 --> 00:21:20,219
It's programming.

407
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:26,465
It's the most disciplinary, multidisciplinary thing that you can do, I think, at times.

408
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:32,310
And in my day-to-day, game writing is actually systems design plus tools development plus

409
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:32,851
creative direction.

410
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:39,171
I need to be aware that things can't change without impacting one another.

411
00:21:39,191 --> 00:21:43,612
And if I have a clear picture in my mind for what the final product is supposed to feel

412
00:21:43,652 --> 00:21:46,273
like, I can make informed decisions about all these things.

413
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:50,754
Like not as a writer or a director or a project leader or whatever, but simply as someone

414
00:21:50,774 --> 00:21:54,095
who's making things in the pursuit of a broader creative goal.

415
00:21:55,335 --> 00:21:55,835
So that's it.

416
00:21:56,336 --> 00:21:58,056
I hope you find some of this useful.

417
00:21:59,556 --> 00:22:00,817
Hopefully the game comes out as good.

418
00:22:02,661 --> 00:22:04,583
I hope it results in a cool game for us to play.

419
00:22:04,603 --> 00:22:06,845
I don't think we do Q&A at these, is that right?

420
00:22:07,465 --> 00:22:10,808
But yeah, you can find me there if you have questions.

421
00:22:10,988 --> 00:22:11,388
Maybe we do.

422
00:22:11,428 --> 00:22:12,469
I don't know, do we not?

423
00:22:14,231 --> 00:22:14,471
OK.

424
00:22:15,131 --> 00:22:15,612
So thank you.

425
00:22:15,632 --> 00:22:15,972
That's it.
