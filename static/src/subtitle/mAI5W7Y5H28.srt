1
00:00:06,465 --> 00:00:09,887
that's not at all what it's about by the way. Another round

2
00:00:09,907 --> 00:00:16,692
of applause for Ojiro. The reason I have him up here, I'm

3
00:00:16,712 --> 00:00:19,453
not going to look at him, he can secretly give you guys a thumbs

4
00:00:19,513 --> 00:00:21,495
up and thumbs down if I'm talking bullshit and making

5
00:00:21,535 --> 00:00:25,037
lies up here. That's the whole point. I'm going to try to make

6
00:00:25,077 --> 00:00:27,438
this quick. I'm not that great of a public speaker. Hopefully

7
00:00:27,619 --> 00:00:29,920
we can get to the questions quick and start thinking of them

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,080
now.

9
00:00:31,221 --> 00:00:35,463
I should introduce myself again. Nigel Lowry. I work at

10
00:00:35,503 --> 00:00:40,305
Devolver Digital. So you don't need a fucking publisher. But if

11
00:00:40,345 --> 00:00:42,866
you do, ask questions. And that's what this really is

12
00:00:42,906 --> 00:00:45,968
about. It's a little misleading of a title. I think that one of

13
00:00:45,988 --> 00:00:49,189
the biggest things that people need to know is that you don't

14
00:00:49,209 --> 00:00:51,590
need a publisher. I think everyone knows that by now. And

15
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:54,772
this is what this discussion is about. If you do, start asking

16
00:00:54,812 --> 00:00:58,173
questions. Mostly, like I said, it's going to be about asking

17
00:00:58,213 --> 00:00:59,734
questions. Not right now. No one go to the mic.

18
00:01:00,808 --> 00:01:03,833
But the fundamental part of getting any sort of business

19
00:01:03,853 --> 00:01:09,382
deal at all, including getting a publisher, is to kind of ask

20
00:01:09,422 --> 00:01:12,107
questions. Know everything you can possibly know. People are

21
00:01:12,127 --> 00:01:15,052
still coming in. Welcome. I'll wait.

22
00:01:15,986 --> 00:01:19,207
I'm just kidding. This might be a short presentation. Actually

23
00:01:19,247 --> 00:01:22,468
it will be long because I mumble a lot. But I invite you to start

24
00:01:22,488 --> 00:01:24,928
thinking of these questions now because I think I'm here. I want

25
00:01:24,948 --> 00:01:27,869
to answer them. This is a forum in which I can give you some

26
00:01:27,889 --> 00:01:29,790
information. But I do want you guys to think of questions

27
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:32,250
because I'm happy to answer as many as I can. And I'll stay

28
00:01:32,311 --> 00:01:35,491
late. I have nothing else to do. I'm a really sad person.

29
00:01:36,616 --> 00:01:40,781
So a few disclosures. The first being I also work at an indie

30
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:42,743
publisher like I mentioned before. And the reason I wanted

31
00:01:42,763 --> 00:01:45,545
to do this talk is we get a lot of pitches. Literally dozens and

32
00:01:45,585 --> 00:01:52,793
dozens of pitches. Please do not tell my wife I said that.

33
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,021
and it's become very clear that a lot of developers don't really

34
00:01:57,061 --> 00:02:00,302
know either to even ask questions or the right questions

35
00:02:00,322 --> 00:02:04,224
to ask and who to ask them to. Like any industry, gaming is

36
00:02:04,564 --> 00:02:06,785
fantastic, but there's good guys, there's bad guys and

37
00:02:06,825 --> 00:02:08,346
there's good guys that don't know what the fuck they're doing

38
00:02:08,746 --> 00:02:11,067
and maybe, you know, aren't providing all the information

39
00:02:11,087 --> 00:02:13,788
that they should. So maybe I can make some decent points today,

40
00:02:14,048 --> 00:02:17,870
talk about what we look for, what to look for, excuse me, and

41
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,590
what to ask about before signing an agreement.

42
00:02:22,044 --> 00:02:24,586
So this is the agenda, aka last chance to leave before it's

43
00:02:24,646 --> 00:02:29,830
rude. With that said, you know, this is not going to have a lot

44
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,312
of cool charts and data. This is almost all entirely anecdotal

45
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:35,194
stuff. My intention here is to pass on information to everybody

46
00:02:35,234 --> 00:02:38,636
here from my side of the fence, from the evil publisher side of

47
00:02:38,656 --> 00:02:40,918
the fence and bring to light some of the issues and

48
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:44,301
challenges that crop up even in our business and things I hear

49
00:02:44,361 --> 00:02:45,361
from developers I talk to.

50
00:02:47,815 --> 00:02:50,798
So any publishers, one board every minute. I'm going to back

51
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:53,080
up. The things I'm going to talk about are indie publishers.

52
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,382
What is that? What the fuck does that even mean? Publisher

53
00:02:56,542 --> 00:03:00,305
partner. Are those things the same thing? Are they different?

54
00:03:00,545 --> 00:03:03,328
I think that's kind of the crux of this conversation. And then

55
00:03:03,868 --> 00:03:05,670
common issues. Common issues we just kind of see.

56
00:03:07,131 --> 00:03:11,955
So any publishers, a.k.a. one born every minute. When I was

57
00:03:11,975 --> 00:03:14,356
thinking about what I was going to say here, I kept coming back

58
00:03:14,376 --> 00:03:17,899
to this inherent struggle that small developers have on why

59
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:20,461
they might even look for a publisher. The game market is

60
00:03:20,481 --> 00:03:23,543
wonderful, amazing, but you're all pouring your heart and soul

61
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:27,827
into these games and it can become pretty terrifying when

62
00:03:27,847 --> 00:03:30,168
it's time to either really work on it or it's getting close and

63
00:03:30,188 --> 00:03:31,129
you want to launch, right?

64
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:35,273
So often times developers don't want to go it alone. This kind

65
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,755
of made me think of this famous scene from the opening moments

66
00:03:37,775 --> 00:03:40,818
of Legend of Zelda where link is about to embark on this grand

67
00:03:40,858 --> 00:03:44,802
adventure. He walks into this room and some old dude tosses him

68
00:03:44,822 --> 00:03:45,903
a sword and gives him a warning.

69
00:03:47,789 --> 00:03:50,551
link takes it and doesn't ask a single question. Just rolls out

70
00:03:50,691 --> 00:03:52,833
assumes because this guy knows what he's done, been there,

71
00:03:52,873 --> 00:03:54,734
knows what he's doing, is going to give him all the information

72
00:03:54,774 --> 00:03:58,637
he needs. What do we find out? Yes, the sword was helpful, but

73
00:03:58,657 --> 00:04:00,859
it was not the only tool that he actually needed. He needed

74
00:04:00,979 --> 00:04:02,940
quite a few things to finish his adventure.

75
00:04:04,261 --> 00:04:07,225
and there's more things necessary to complete this task

76
00:04:07,245 --> 00:04:10,288
than just the sword. So he didn't ask questions. He doesn't

77
00:04:10,308 --> 00:04:13,371
know who this guy is or what he did. And he doesn't know what

78
00:04:13,391 --> 00:04:15,473
kind of cut this guy has taken off the back end of this

79
00:04:15,513 --> 00:04:19,197
adventure, right? Maybe this guy is getting 75% of all the

80
00:04:19,237 --> 00:04:22,000
rupees that he collects. We don't even know. And what

81
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,282
happened to Link? He didn't ask questions and he ended up in a

82
00:04:24,383 --> 00:04:26,305
shitty sequel. I'm saying it. Sell the two subs.

83
00:04:29,737 --> 00:04:32,519
So publishers have been around for nearly as long as game

84
00:04:32,559 --> 00:04:35,640
developers but I did zero research on the subject so that

85
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,581
might not be true. But what I'm certain is there's always been

86
00:04:38,601 --> 00:04:41,603
this animosity between developers and publishers and

87
00:04:41,963 --> 00:04:46,125
rightfully so. The latest I think most obvious thing is at

88
00:04:46,145 --> 00:04:49,327
the end of every kick starter people mention why are they

89
00:04:49,347 --> 00:04:51,968
doing this kick starter. Well, because they want to avoid

90
00:04:52,008 --> 00:04:55,229
publishers because they're bad, they'll ruin creativity, they'll

91
00:04:55,249 --> 00:04:57,511
take a hold of the game, they're going to cheat them out of

92
00:04:57,571 --> 00:04:57,751
money.

93
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:01,434
and honestly publishers have behaved badly for years and this

94
00:05:01,515 --> 00:05:07,621
is an absolutely perfect rational thing to say. But this

95
00:05:07,661 --> 00:05:10,024
happens all the time and it's unfortunate and there's some

96
00:05:10,064 --> 00:05:11,926
good people out there and some bad people like I said before

97
00:05:11,986 --> 00:05:13,027
but this happens all the time.

98
00:05:13,568 --> 00:05:15,870
But I do think the game has changed. I think everyone in

99
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:18,552
this room, this is not news. The game has changed. Digital

100
00:05:18,592 --> 00:05:21,014
distribution, I put the little exclamation marks because I'm

101
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:23,756
not as good as a Giro at graphics. But I put these sweet

102
00:05:23,836 --> 00:05:27,419
exclamation marks up there because digital distribution is

103
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:30,682
a point that really changed a lot of things. It bestowed an

104
00:05:30,962 --> 00:05:34,164
unbelievable amount of leverage with the developer that changed

105
00:05:34,264 --> 00:05:38,408
everything because you can get directly to your consumers. This

106
00:05:38,468 --> 00:05:41,170
is an important moment and for now, like I said, it's shifted

107
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,371
this kind of perceived power.

108
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:48,237
So we've seen those bar graphs, those charts where there's huge

109
00:05:48,277 --> 00:05:50,798
acceleration in the number of games being released on steam,

110
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:53,340
app store, everything like that. And you can argue a lot of

111
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,682
different reasons. Digital distribution is one. Accessible

112
00:05:56,722 --> 00:06:00,224
tools, less stringent curation on these store fronts. But

113
00:06:00,284 --> 00:06:02,285
that's not the news. Everyone knows there's a lot of games out

114
00:06:02,305 --> 00:06:04,487
here. I especially think this audience knows there's a shit

115
00:06:04,507 --> 00:06:07,889
load of games out there, right? What's interesting to us is,

116
00:06:07,929 --> 00:06:08,269
hey, Evan.

117
00:06:11,816 --> 00:06:14,817
What is news to us, what is interesting to us is a lot of

118
00:06:14,877 --> 00:06:18,879
service providers now. People, whether it is a publisher or a

119
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:22,041
localization company, there is a lot of things being built up

120
00:06:22,101 --> 00:06:26,003
around any games and any game developers. A service provider

121
00:06:26,043 --> 00:06:28,204
like I said can be anyone from a localization company to a

122
00:06:28,244 --> 00:06:31,145
testing studio but there is more and more of these. And game

123
00:06:31,185 --> 00:06:32,166
publishers are no exception.

124
00:06:32,897 --> 00:06:37,279
The indie publisher market has lots of options now. Devolver

125
00:06:37,299 --> 00:06:41,840
being one. As you can see this is a small example of the

126
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,722
different publishers you can go with. What's important is to

127
00:06:45,742 --> 00:06:48,062
understand each one's direction, their strategy, their

128
00:06:48,082 --> 00:06:48,743
capabilities.

129
00:06:50,524 --> 00:06:53,266
know what is right for your game. The names on this screen,

130
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:55,448
these two screens, I didn't know there was going to be two

131
00:06:55,488 --> 00:06:58,470
screens. The names on these two screens are just a handful of

132
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:01,392
companies to consider. They are publishers, game labels,

133
00:07:01,652 --> 00:07:03,914
whatever, but they all have their own kind of thing of

134
00:07:03,954 --> 00:07:05,776
taking your game, working with your game and getting it to a

135
00:07:05,816 --> 00:07:09,679
larger audience. Sony computer entertainment obviously has

136
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,461
their kind of angle to do it. Indie funds specialize in

137
00:07:12,601 --> 00:07:13,642
obviously funding Indies.

138
00:07:14,402 --> 00:07:17,585
and having really, really friendly developer agreements.

139
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:21,648
And folks like team 17, adult swim and double fine are

140
00:07:21,688 --> 00:07:23,589
fantastic groups that can release your game, but they're

141
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:27,672
developers themselves and they can offer a lot of insight in

142
00:07:27,692 --> 00:07:30,635
the game development. My point here is the publisher can mean a

143
00:07:30,715 --> 00:07:32,836
lot of different things, so I'm going to lump them all together,

144
00:07:33,116 --> 00:07:36,079
but they all have their own minutia and details of what they

145
00:07:36,099 --> 00:07:40,582
might specialize in. Water, sorry.

146
00:07:42,815 --> 00:07:46,276
Okay. So I want to get to the meat of this. We know there's a

147
00:07:46,336 --> 00:07:48,496
shit load of options. I'm cussing a lot. I apologize.

148
00:07:49,076 --> 00:07:51,957
There's a ton of options out there when a developer wants to

149
00:07:51,997 --> 00:07:54,277
find a publisher to work with and now you need to get to this

150
00:07:54,377 --> 00:07:57,238
vetting process. What's going to work for you, what's going to

151
00:07:57,258 --> 00:07:59,399
work for your team and what's going to work for the game

152
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:02,379
itself. So most of the developers that we talk to, the

153
00:08:02,419 --> 00:08:04,860
discussion starts around what is the publisher going to do for

154
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,681
me. And then it kind of works its way towards what can you do

155
00:08:07,701 --> 00:08:10,741
for my game. That's kind of an important evolution of that

156
00:08:10,761 --> 00:08:11,181
discussion.

157
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:13,883
So the best way I thought when I was thinking about what to say

158
00:08:13,903 --> 00:08:18,747
here is to frame this by categorizing this into what are

159
00:08:18,767 --> 00:08:21,169
things that a publisher should do for you and what are things

160
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:23,931
that a partner should do for you. Now these things aren't

161
00:08:23,951 --> 00:08:26,913
necessarily at odds with each other but they don't also

162
00:08:27,113 --> 00:08:29,415
necessarily always come hand in hand. So this is what I want

163
00:08:29,435 --> 00:08:31,756
people to be careful to when they're talking to publishers,

164
00:08:31,817 --> 00:08:34,479
partners, game labels, whatever it's being called these days.

165
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:38,902
You need to find out the potential publisher you're

166
00:08:38,922 --> 00:08:41,925
working for and find out what they're going to do for you and

167
00:08:41,945 --> 00:08:44,928
what you are looking for in a partner and reconcile those two

168
00:08:44,968 --> 00:08:47,190
things. Because that's what's really, really important. You

169
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:50,332
don't want to pay for things basically that you're not going

170
00:08:50,352 --> 00:08:52,915
to use and you want to find a publisher that can do all the

171
00:08:52,935 --> 00:08:53,655
things you need it to do.

172
00:08:56,722 --> 00:09:00,143
So what can a publisher provide? These are the basic

173
00:09:00,163 --> 00:09:02,044
things that people think about when they're talking about a

174
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:06,085
publisher. A developer can hypothetically do all of these

175
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:08,605
things themselves. Actually not hypothetically, they can do all

176
00:09:08,645 --> 00:09:11,206
these things themselves. That's why it's called self-publishing

177
00:09:11,226 --> 00:09:14,987
and a lot of people do it. The reason people like Ojiro work

178
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:18,228
with us is because they don't want to do them and they think

179
00:09:18,248 --> 00:09:20,888
that a publisher can do them better and more efficiently.

180
00:09:21,248 --> 00:09:23,709
So they can focus on making the game. Give the thumbs up right

181
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:24,389
now. Okay.

182
00:09:27,052 --> 00:09:36,520
your royalty check is due. So these are the base level things

183
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:39,022
though. These are not things that should excite you. These

184
00:09:39,062 --> 00:09:42,805
are what you should be expecting from a publisher. I don't really

185
00:09:42,825 --> 00:09:45,127
want to dwell on all of them. I'm not going to go into too

186
00:09:45,147 --> 00:09:46,748
much detail but I do want to talk about marketing

187
00:09:46,788 --> 00:09:49,691
distribution. I think these are the areas that are maybe most

188
00:09:49,751 --> 00:09:53,754
foreign to developers and maybe distinguishing characteristics

189
00:09:53,794 --> 00:09:55,576
I guess between different publishers you can talk to.

190
00:09:56,772 --> 00:09:59,633
So marketing. Marketing is like saying I'm a game developer.

191
00:09:59,653 --> 00:10:01,693
It's game development. What does that mean? There's a lot of

192
00:10:01,753 --> 00:10:03,974
things in marketing. There's a lot of different disciplines.

193
00:10:03,994 --> 00:10:06,135
That's PR, that's advertising, that's events. It's everything

194
00:10:06,155 --> 00:10:08,756
that's going to position and communicate your game out to the

195
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:13,377
world. And this is where you need to start asking questions.

196
00:10:13,397 --> 00:10:15,358
You're going to see this theme throughout my discussion. You

197
00:10:15,378 --> 00:10:17,979
need to start asking questions about everything that this

198
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:22,440
publisher that you're talking to might do. So the PR teams, for

199
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,461
example. Understand, is it them doing the PR?

200
00:10:25,357 --> 00:10:28,058
is it a team of people doing the PR? Are they contracting this

201
00:10:28,138 --> 00:10:30,999
out? All of these things are valid. Finding out where are

202
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,280
their PR teams. When they say they're going to do PR, is it

203
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,441
just North America? That's not good. There's a lot of people

204
00:10:36,501 --> 00:10:38,862
outside of North America that buy video games and want to be

205
00:10:38,902 --> 00:10:43,023
talked to with their own cultural nuances and localize

206
00:10:43,563 --> 00:10:45,124
the information you're giving them into their language.

207
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:48,288
do they include streamers and YouTubers when they are talking

208
00:10:48,328 --> 00:10:52,736
about PR? If they don't include YouTubers and streamers, walk

209
00:10:52,856 --> 00:10:55,841
out of the door, lock that door and set the building on fire

210
00:10:55,861 --> 00:10:56,762
because they don't know what they are doing.

211
00:10:58,101 --> 00:11:01,042
advertising. How are they going to spend this money? I think a

212
00:11:01,102 --> 00:11:03,763
lot of times we talk to folks and we'll mention advertising

213
00:11:03,783 --> 00:11:07,504
and they don't even ask what that means. And we then give

214
00:11:07,524 --> 00:11:09,005
the information or at least someone should give the

215
00:11:09,025 --> 00:11:11,566
information to them. But you need to ask how this money will

216
00:11:11,606 --> 00:11:14,687
be spent. They don't look at the line and go great, we have a

217
00:11:14,727 --> 00:11:17,628
great advertising budget. You need to find out what that means

218
00:11:17,688 --> 00:11:18,608
and how they're going to spend it.

219
00:11:20,184 --> 00:11:23,125
events do they go to? Do they go to events? Do they have people

220
00:11:23,165 --> 00:11:25,727
that go to events outside of North America? I think that's

221
00:11:25,767 --> 00:11:28,468
important too. There's a lot of amazing things like bit summit

222
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:32,291
in Japan, Ojiro went to and there's a lot of amazing events

223
00:11:32,331 --> 00:11:34,632
to go to that are going to spread your game outwards. So

224
00:11:34,672 --> 00:11:37,413
just be mindful of where their PR activities are really

225
00:11:37,454 --> 00:11:37,794
happening.

226
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,105
And then of course a cohesive campaign, right?

227
00:11:41,165 --> 00:11:42,546
You need to look at what they've done,

228
00:11:42,806 --> 00:11:44,727
what is their strategy, what have they done in the past,

229
00:11:44,847 --> 00:11:46,888
how have they customized that for different games?

230
00:11:46,928 --> 00:11:48,168
There's not a template to marketing.

231
00:11:48,188 --> 00:11:49,729
There's not a template to game development.

232
00:11:49,949 --> 00:11:52,470
I guess there is if you're making some really clones,

233
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:54,211
you know, clone mobile games or something like that.

234
00:11:54,271 --> 00:11:55,172
I didn't look at you for a reason.

235
00:11:55,192 --> 00:11:55,832
Not you, not you.

236
00:11:58,313 --> 00:12:00,294
But you need to find out what their strategy is.

237
00:12:00,334 --> 00:12:01,775
Find out what their beliefs are in marketing.

238
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:06,165
The other part is distribution. I'm going to be honest, five

239
00:12:06,185 --> 00:12:10,047
years ago, publishers that we know or people I know or any

240
00:12:10,087 --> 00:12:12,628
publisher could tell you, well, I can get your game on steam.

241
00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:15,750
That was a lot of times enough for people to get excited and

242
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:18,031
sign up with them. I don't think that's right. That's definitely

243
00:12:18,051 --> 00:12:20,432
not right anymore. Anyone can get your game on steam or you

244
00:12:20,452 --> 00:12:24,234
can bypass steam or go on play station. There's itch. There's

245
00:12:24,354 --> 00:12:26,455
all sorts of amazing places to get your game directly to

246
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:26,895
consumers.

247
00:12:28,753 --> 00:12:32,175
But I will note when I was thinking about this, it's fair

248
00:12:32,195 --> 00:12:34,697
or unfair. Publishers do have their advantage. You should ask

249
00:12:34,717 --> 00:12:37,739
them what these advantages might be. One of the things I talk

250
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:41,642
about is publishers get direct lines sometimes with a lot of

251
00:12:41,702 --> 00:12:44,404
people at them. Because they have a lot of content, then

252
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:47,606
people at steam or valve or play station or x box or whoever

253
00:12:48,707 --> 00:12:51,089
You have a direct contact there and there's advantages of having

254
00:12:51,129 --> 00:12:53,111
that for placement, store placement, things like that.

255
00:12:53,131 --> 00:12:54,632
There's things like publisher sales.

256
00:12:54,692 --> 00:12:57,595
Like, again, right or wrong, there's a publisher sale that

257
00:12:57,635 --> 00:12:59,917
Devolver Digital will get and it will increase revenue for these

258
00:12:59,957 --> 00:13:00,097
games.

259
00:13:00,117 --> 00:13:03,080
So you need to ask your publisher what they do and how

260
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,041
they're going to make more money than you would make on yours

261
00:13:05,102 --> 00:13:06,543
alone when it comes to sales and distribution.

262
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:11,211
And the last thing I'd say on this distribution is look what

263
00:13:11,251 --> 00:13:14,432
else you're going to be amongst with the game, with the

264
00:13:14,492 --> 00:13:17,552
catalog of games that publisher has. To see where you sit.

265
00:13:17,592 --> 00:13:20,293
There's some games, there's some publishers out there or

266
00:13:21,154 --> 00:13:23,154
partners or whatever you want to call them at this point in

267
00:13:23,174 --> 00:13:25,775
the discussion that specialize in things. There's point and

268
00:13:25,795 --> 00:13:28,516
click adventure folks that do really, really good, have a lot

269
00:13:28,536 --> 00:13:30,496
of point and click adventures and you would sit amongst them

270
00:13:30,937 --> 00:13:32,657
and there's some synergy there.

271
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:39,001
So these are what a publisher like I said should provide. And

272
00:13:39,021 --> 00:13:41,242
I like in this, this is the basics when you're buying a car

273
00:13:41,262 --> 00:13:44,163
and the car salesman says well it's got four wheels, it's got

274
00:13:44,464 --> 00:13:46,625
windshield wipers and it will take you from point A to point

275
00:13:46,645 --> 00:13:50,787
B. Yeah I know that. Sell me on what's next. I think this is the

276
00:13:50,827 --> 00:13:53,368
crucial moment for a lot of developers that don't keep

277
00:13:53,448 --> 00:13:57,270
asking questions. Or the publisher doesn't provide more

278
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:00,491
answers of what they're going to do beyond those things. I don't

279
00:14:00,531 --> 00:14:02,792
know how to emphasize this enough but these things that you

280
00:14:02,812 --> 00:14:03,273
see up here.

281
00:14:04,409 --> 00:14:09,011
That's the base level thing you should be expecting. So what do

282
00:14:09,031 --> 00:14:12,833
I mean, so what's next? What's after that, right? And this is

283
00:14:12,873 --> 00:14:15,095
where I kind of got in my head this discussion that was going

284
00:14:15,175 --> 00:14:17,876
on, discussion with developers we work with and discussion with

285
00:14:18,216 --> 00:14:21,898
the folks that I work with at my company, what's next step? We

286
00:14:21,938 --> 00:14:26,060
think it's being a true partner. And what do I mean like that?

287
00:14:28,786 --> 00:14:32,527
ask that publisher, ask them about funding, ask them about

288
00:14:32,567 --> 00:14:35,768
things. But these, when you're funding partner, you're going to

289
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:38,529
ask them some questions I'm going to get into. But you also

290
00:14:38,549 --> 00:14:41,030
need, it's very important to start asking questions to the

291
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:44,331
developers they worked with previously. That's where you're

292
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:50,332
going to find a new angle, a new way of maybe assessing this

293
00:14:50,372 --> 00:14:52,773
publisher. Because they're going to tell you what happened,

294
00:14:52,813 --> 00:14:53,613
whether it was good or bad.

295
00:14:56,106 --> 00:14:58,887
another thing, when you're talking to developers from this

296
00:14:58,927 --> 00:15:02,029
publisher that you're speaking with, don't just talk to the

297
00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:04,111
people that sold a lot of copies because they're probably going

298
00:15:04,131 --> 00:15:07,072
to be pretty happy, right? And they're probably going to be

299
00:15:07,112 --> 00:15:11,095
pretty pleased with it. Go find the developer that maybe, you

300
00:15:11,115 --> 00:15:12,956
know, the game was fine but didn't sell a ton of copies

301
00:15:13,036 --> 00:15:15,337
because you maybe can find a new dimension to that discussion.

302
00:15:16,098 --> 00:15:19,060
And, you know, find more about how that developer, excuse me,

303
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,841
how that publisher carries themselves when maybe things

304
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:23,983
aren't as stellar as, you know, you had hoped.

305
00:15:25,229 --> 00:15:28,891
So what can a partner provide? A true partner, and again this

306
00:15:28,951 --> 00:15:30,992
is where I think a developer needs to start looking and

307
00:15:31,072 --> 00:15:34,775
start assessing more and not stop at what does a publisher

308
00:15:34,815 --> 00:15:37,856
provide. These things like I said aren't easy to ascertain

309
00:15:38,257 --> 00:15:41,239
and the publisher is going to, you know, there's a salesman

310
00:15:41,259 --> 00:15:43,520
you're basically talking to. They want to sell you on them as

311
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:47,002
a company. And I'm going to speak to creativity and

312
00:15:47,042 --> 00:15:47,703
enthusiasm.

313
00:15:48,619 --> 00:15:53,504
AKA giving a fuck about your game. I know it's language but

314
00:15:53,564 --> 00:15:56,127
that's an important part because you don't want to sign up for

315
00:15:56,147 --> 00:15:58,429
somebody that really doesn't care about your game once it's

316
00:15:58,449 --> 00:16:02,654
signed on. The stage and the spotlight, a personal

317
00:16:02,694 --> 00:16:04,676
relationship and brutal honesty.

318
00:16:07,454 --> 00:16:11,055
So when I say creativity I don't just mean good ideas for launch

319
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,856
trailers. I don't just mean like hey what about some slow-mo

320
00:16:13,996 --> 00:16:17,597
action and slow-mo music. It's going to be beautiful. I'm not

321
00:16:17,637 --> 00:16:19,877
talking about those kind of things. I'm talking about the

322
00:16:19,917 --> 00:16:23,998
creative enthusiasm about every element of your game. That's

323
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:26,479
just marketing, that's distribution, that's production,

324
00:16:26,979 --> 00:16:30,360
that's funding. Working with you in the way you may have money

325
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,520
already and doing things smart and different.

326
00:16:33,301 --> 00:16:35,903
to make sure you're happy and comfortable. Don't just check

327
00:16:35,943 --> 00:16:38,105
stuff off a list. These are people thinking and being

328
00:16:38,145 --> 00:16:42,708
creative about every part of your game. Again, look at the

329
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:45,630
publisher's body of work. That's the easiest thing to do. You can

330
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:47,712
scroll through their YouTube channel. You can scroll through

331
00:16:47,732 --> 00:16:50,174
their website. You can scroll through Metacritic. You can see

332
00:16:50,194 --> 00:16:52,216
what they've worked on. You can see where they've been

333
00:16:52,236 --> 00:16:55,998
successful and where they may be applied creativity to everything

334
00:16:56,039 --> 00:17:00,202
they do. You need to find out if they've done things that are

335
00:17:00,222 --> 00:17:02,263
successful before and how that might apply to your game.

336
00:17:04,307 --> 00:17:06,008
I mean frankly they're going to show you all the best things

337
00:17:06,028 --> 00:17:09,569
they've ever done and the big fancy launch trailers or they

338
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:11,929
could. I'm just saying a good one is going to show you some

339
00:17:12,009 --> 00:17:16,030
smart thinking. And I'm not going to try and pimp us out as

340
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:18,251
a publisher. That's the whole point. I just want to talk about

341
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:21,072
in general. But one thing I do want to reference because I use

342
00:17:21,112 --> 00:17:24,153
this in my discussion with developers as a point of when

343
00:17:24,193 --> 00:17:26,393
you're thinking about every aspect of it. This is a game

344
00:17:26,433 --> 00:17:27,994
called hotline Miami that we worked on in 2011, 2012.

345
00:17:32,975 --> 00:17:36,096
point I want to make is this ridiculous phone number we set

346
00:17:36,136 --> 00:17:38,336
up for hotline Miami. It was late one night and we're

347
00:17:38,356 --> 00:17:41,637
thinking of fun things to do. If you played the game, part of

348
00:17:41,677 --> 00:17:45,837
the game is you get these crazy calls from a telephone. Crazy

349
00:17:45,877 --> 00:17:50,578
messages. We thought it would be fun to, we found a Google voice

350
00:17:50,998 --> 00:17:55,959
number in Miami, Florida and we grabbed it and we left a weird

351
00:17:55,979 --> 00:17:57,679
message and we start leaving this phone number.

352
00:18:00,001 --> 00:18:03,243
you know, press releases, website, social media. So we

353
00:18:03,263 --> 00:18:06,884
sent that out for a week. Never checked it. That would be funny.

354
00:18:06,925 --> 00:18:10,046
What if people start calling you if they leave messages. To open

355
00:18:10,086 --> 00:18:13,428
it up, it's got 4,000 voice mails and like 600 text

356
00:18:13,488 --> 00:18:15,249
messages, which I didn't know you could do on Google voice and

357
00:18:15,269 --> 00:18:17,050
it was very concerning what people were writing.

358
00:18:19,607 --> 00:18:22,727
but the cool thing, my point with this is, is it's not, don't

359
00:18:22,747 --> 00:18:26,288
just look at the high level fancy things, you think, I mean

360
00:18:26,308 --> 00:18:28,229
those are very important, trailers are important, booths

361
00:18:28,289 --> 00:18:30,569
are important, but look for where people are thinking of

362
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,230
things like this that cost nothing and really like this,

363
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:35,991
engage the community and get them excited and talking about

364
00:18:36,011 --> 00:18:38,211
it. Because that's where I think you're going to find that

365
00:18:38,311 --> 00:18:39,192
difference in creativity.

366
00:18:40,475 --> 00:18:42,817
The next thing is stage and spotlight. A good publisher

367
00:18:42,857 --> 00:18:46,400
should put this developer first. This is important for your

368
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,203
personal fulfillment as a developer but it's also very

369
00:18:49,243 --> 00:18:51,825
important for you as a studio and you as maybe a lone

370
00:18:51,845 --> 00:18:54,787
developer. That when you're done with this game people know about

371
00:18:54,827 --> 00:18:57,389
your work and that you did it. And you were the one that made

372
00:18:57,449 --> 00:18:57,589
this.

373
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,731
and when you're ready to do your next thing, they know who you

374
00:19:00,871 --> 00:19:05,313
are. It's not about necessarily whose logo is bigger, but just

375
00:19:05,373 --> 00:19:09,015
make sure that you are always center stage whenever your

376
00:19:09,035 --> 00:19:12,677
gaming is being presented and not the publisher putting their

377
00:19:12,697 --> 00:19:13,417
name out there first.

378
00:19:15,132 --> 00:19:18,654
And a good partner will do this. And I will be frank with

379
00:19:18,674 --> 00:19:22,916
you, we fight for this, have to fight platforms and first party

380
00:19:22,956 --> 00:19:26,558
people to say, I know what your rules are but you got to take

381
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:28,900
devolver digital off of this. You need to put the developer on

382
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,641
there. Because I think it's very important that people

383
00:19:30,681 --> 00:19:33,983
understand that they made it. I can't make games. I can barely

384
00:19:34,023 --> 00:19:37,365
put together a power point. I promise you that. And I think

385
00:19:37,405 --> 00:19:40,387
it's important for you and your studio to have that kind of

386
00:19:40,427 --> 00:19:41,267
spotlight put on you.

387
00:19:43,226 --> 00:19:47,307
The one thing I will note and I think, you know, Ojiro is up

388
00:19:47,347 --> 00:19:49,508
here, it's a really good example. Not all developers

389
00:19:49,568 --> 00:19:52,550
necessarily want that spotlight. We were first working together,

390
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:56,411
we had to go to a twitch stage, what was it, PAX East, we had

391
00:19:56,431 --> 00:19:57,072
some twitch thing.

392
00:19:58,722 --> 00:20:03,325
And he came to me and was like, I'm not super excited about

393
00:20:03,345 --> 00:20:07,348
being in the spotlight on this one. So your publisher, your

394
00:20:07,388 --> 00:20:10,089
partner, needs to understand that and understand what your

395
00:20:10,129 --> 00:20:13,191
little idiosyncrasies might be, what you are comfortable doing.

396
00:20:13,909 --> 00:20:17,691
And maybe you, the publisher, excuse me, not you, the

397
00:20:17,711 --> 00:20:20,772
developer, you, the publisher, might need to speak for your

398
00:20:20,792 --> 00:20:23,574
game, okay? And I'm not talking about marketing bullet points

399
00:20:23,594 --> 00:20:26,755
from a fact sheet. I'm talking about knowing your game inside

400
00:20:26,775 --> 00:20:29,236
and out. Being able to demo the hell out of that game in front

401
00:20:29,276 --> 00:20:32,037
of somebody, speak for you and represent you and your studio

402
00:20:32,077 --> 00:20:32,258
well.

403
00:20:33,118 --> 00:20:36,999
I think this is a pretty crucial part because the whole idea is

404
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:38,720
you guys can focus on your game. You're not going to be able to

405
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,460
go to every show. You're not going to be able to go to every

406
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,261
event. You need to make sure the partners out there that you

407
00:20:43,341 --> 00:20:46,802
trust will represent your game well and speak kind of in the

408
00:20:46,842 --> 00:20:54,284
tone that you want it to be presented. This one is me almost

409
00:20:54,884 --> 00:20:57,405
tearing up over there when Ojiro was up here.

410
00:20:58,387 --> 00:21:02,489
because it's a personal relationship. You need to make

411
00:21:02,569 --> 00:21:06,011
sure, this is a very aspirational thing, but you're

412
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:07,852
looking for a personal relationship with these folks.

413
00:21:08,712 --> 00:21:11,534
This person, this partner you're going to work with, they're

414
00:21:11,554 --> 00:21:14,815
going to be a part of your life for 18 months, two years, five

415
00:21:14,855 --> 00:21:16,656
years, whatever it is. And you need to make sure.

416
00:21:16,997 --> 00:21:19,138
that you can develop some, you don't have to necessarily like

417
00:21:19,158 --> 00:21:21,019
them, but you have some sort of personal working good

418
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:24,301
relationship with them. I'm sorry, you may not want to have

419
00:21:24,341 --> 00:21:26,922
a beer with them and spend the night at their house and staying

420
00:21:26,962 --> 00:21:30,725
up all night playing NBA jam. But you do have to have some

421
00:21:30,745 --> 00:21:32,786
sort of personal relationship with them and you need to

422
00:21:32,866 --> 00:21:36,988
understand the organization of the company itself. The guy that

423
00:21:37,128 --> 00:21:40,490
me, let's say me, that is signing your game, let's not say

424
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,751
me, I'm not supposed to use examples of me.

425
00:21:43,213 --> 00:21:46,194
the person that's signing your game, you need to make sure if

426
00:21:46,234 --> 00:21:48,015
that's not the person you're dealing with on a day-to-day

427
00:21:48,055 --> 00:21:51,456
basis, who is that? Understand how that company works, how that

428
00:21:51,516 --> 00:21:55,057
publisher works and who are the people you can go to and speak

429
00:21:55,077 --> 00:21:58,578
with when things need to get done. And you're not talking to

430
00:21:58,858 --> 00:22:01,339
the person that's just your handler, the person that can

431
00:22:01,459 --> 00:22:07,501
actually execute and make things happen for you. The other part,

432
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:09,902
I think I have it up here, can they work?

433
00:22:11,023 --> 00:22:13,504
can they contact them at night, weekends or mid-coitus. I know

434
00:22:13,544 --> 00:22:16,906
it's kind of a joke, but you need to understand that we, you

435
00:22:16,946 --> 00:22:20,487
know, you guys don't work 9 to 5. In fact, I'm pretty sure it's

436
00:22:20,527 --> 00:22:23,489
more like 5 to 9 based on the people I work with. You guys

437
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:26,270
have insane hours, right? So you're going to need someone

438
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:28,611
there, someone you're going to be able to talk to and contact

439
00:22:29,251 --> 00:22:31,612
at any point. And I think you need to talk to the other

440
00:22:31,632 --> 00:22:33,934
developers they work with to see how that goes. Because if it

441
00:22:33,954 --> 00:22:36,575
says 9 to 5 company and you're going to get an answering

442
00:22:36,615 --> 00:22:37,415
machine or you're going to get...

443
00:22:38,276 --> 00:22:39,820
you're not going to be able to get a hold of them, that's

444
00:22:40,101 --> 00:22:41,866
something important you're going to need to know because

445
00:22:42,106 --> 00:22:44,372
things go wrong constantly as you know.

446
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:49,361
And then what are the lengths that people are, this publisher,

447
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:53,882
this potential partner is willing to go for you. A lot of

448
00:22:53,902 --> 00:22:56,243
the people I know I'm talking to and a lot of people I work with

449
00:22:56,323 --> 00:23:00,264
are very small companies and they're the same people that are

450
00:23:00,304 --> 00:23:02,425
making the game, the same people plugging in the computers to the

451
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:05,646
events. So you need to understand how far this partner,

452
00:23:05,686 --> 00:23:10,148
this publisher will go and they're not too fancy to go get

453
00:23:10,168 --> 00:23:12,508
your breakfast tacos when you need them when you're setting up

454
00:23:12,548 --> 00:23:13,249
your demo kiosk.

455
00:23:16,731 --> 00:23:18,892
And then the last thing is brutal honesty. If you have

456
00:23:18,932 --> 00:23:23,534
those other things, a personal relationship for example, the

457
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:26,075
brutal honesty won't be a problem. And I mean this is

458
00:23:26,175 --> 00:23:27,796
going to be a two way street when I talk about brutal

459
00:23:27,836 --> 00:23:31,458
honesty. There's a lot of uncomfortable talks that might

460
00:23:31,498 --> 00:23:34,799
happen when you're working with a business like a publisher.

461
00:23:35,499 --> 00:23:38,821
Money is an uncomfortable subject. Not just the initial

462
00:23:38,861 --> 00:23:42,002
talks about money but ongoing talks about needing more money

463
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:45,284
and then when money starts rolling in from the game being

464
00:23:45,344 --> 00:23:45,584
sold.

465
00:23:46,404 --> 00:23:48,886
understanding and being very clear how that money is coming

466
00:23:48,967 --> 00:23:55,272
in and where it's going. Being able to talk about these things

467
00:23:55,712 --> 00:23:58,435
plainly and openly is very important. And then talking

468
00:23:58,475 --> 00:24:00,957
about, I put on here, tell each other that you suck. You need to

469
00:24:01,017 --> 00:24:04,520
be able to, the publisher, the partner that you're talking to

470
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,402
needs to be able to tell you what they think honestly about

471
00:24:07,442 --> 00:24:09,044
the game. And you need to be able to accept that.

472
00:24:09,932 --> 00:24:13,293
that criticism and either take it or dismiss it. I know we

473
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:17,675
talked about quite a bit, I was watching your talk and there's a

474
00:24:17,695 --> 00:24:20,516
lot of elements that were like, eh, I personally didn't like

475
00:24:20,556 --> 00:24:23,437
that. Nojira was like, cool, fuck you, I'm keeping it in

476
00:24:23,477 --> 00:24:25,517
there. And it's great. And that's the kind of thing you

477
00:24:25,537 --> 00:24:28,719
need to be able to say to a real partner, right? At the same

478
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:32,500
time, he needs to be able to tell me, I'm sorry I'm picking

479
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:35,041
on you, there were supposed to be other developers up here that

480
00:24:35,081 --> 00:24:36,242
are now sitting in the back I see.

481
00:24:38,719 --> 00:24:43,082
The other thing that I would say here is that you need to be

482
00:24:43,142 --> 00:24:47,384
able to tell that partner, that publisher, that you don't like

483
00:24:47,424 --> 00:24:49,925
what they're doing. You need to speak up. If you don't like how

484
00:24:49,945 --> 00:24:51,927
the game is being presented, you don't like the trailer, you

485
00:24:51,947 --> 00:24:54,808
don't like whatever it is, the steam page, whatever it is,

486
00:24:55,208 --> 00:24:58,370
speak up. It's your game. Take a hold of it and tell them that

487
00:24:58,410 --> 00:24:59,711
they're doing a bad job on something.

488
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:03,945
And the last thing I want to say on this brutal honesty thing

489
00:25:04,146 --> 00:25:07,388
is this comes up in a lot of discussions when I'm talking

490
00:25:07,408 --> 00:25:09,289
with developers and they tell me they're talking to another

491
00:25:09,309 --> 00:25:12,471
publisher. If a publisher guarantees you success, they're

492
00:25:12,491 --> 00:25:18,795
fucking lying to you. There's no guarantee of success. I got the

493
00:25:18,835 --> 00:25:21,437
clearance to talk about this but this guy Paul Hart who made a

494
00:25:21,457 --> 00:25:25,259
game called fistful of gun. It was a great game. It didn't sell

495
00:25:25,299 --> 00:25:27,701
really well. And we talked about it. We were honest with each

496
00:25:27,721 --> 00:25:29,182
other the whole time of what these.

497
00:25:30,183 --> 00:25:32,426
what these projections are looking like and once the game

498
00:25:32,466 --> 00:25:37,292
wasn't doing well, what can we do to hopefully, the game

499
00:25:37,332 --> 00:25:40,156
recouped, made money, but how we can maximize it. Because he

500
00:25:40,176 --> 00:25:43,200
spent a lot of time on this game. And we maybe didn't do a

501
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:45,764
good job. And he maybe didn't make the best game he possibly

502
00:25:45,784 --> 00:25:45,944
could.

503
00:25:46,982 --> 00:25:48,884
no one needs to point fingers here. You need to be brutally

504
00:25:48,924 --> 00:25:51,867
honest like how do we make this work now that the game isn't

505
00:25:51,907 --> 00:25:56,072
going as well as we hoped. So I think you need to talk to other

506
00:25:56,092 --> 00:26:00,517
developers and see how they handle not only success but not

507
00:26:00,617 --> 00:26:02,539
success. I'm not going to say failures but not success.

508
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:09,092
There are a lot more things than this. I just have some things

509
00:26:09,112 --> 00:26:12,314
that I thought were important to bring up. This extends like

510
00:26:12,374 --> 00:26:14,835
this, you need to find this deeper level of commitment that

511
00:26:14,875 --> 00:26:17,556
extends past this kind of publisher developer relationship.

512
00:26:18,177 --> 00:26:22,578
This is not an all encompassing list, but my point is I think

513
00:26:22,659 --> 00:26:24,659
you just need to look past the basics.

514
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:28,963
and what the publisher should give you and look beyond what

515
00:26:29,003 --> 00:26:31,526
you really need as a person. Because you all have different

516
00:26:31,566 --> 00:26:33,968
situations, you all have different circumstances which

517
00:26:33,988 --> 00:26:37,171
you're operating. So you need to look past that and ask as many

518
00:26:37,251 --> 00:26:40,114
questions as possible. So this leads to this last little piece

519
00:26:40,134 --> 00:26:43,337
about some common issues that crop up, right? This is all

520
00:26:43,498 --> 00:26:46,601
again anecdotal, but I thought they were worthy of these

521
00:26:46,681 --> 00:26:47,962
amazing slides that I put together.

522
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:51,756
Clearly some of these are related to the publisher partner

523
00:26:51,877 --> 00:26:54,680
kind of elements that I just talked about. So I'll make it

524
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:58,425
kind of quick. Intellectual property, IP, if the game is

525
00:26:58,445 --> 00:27:02,489
your baby, the IP is its soul. So you need to take care of both

526
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:06,775
and hold on to both. Do not sell your IP. Do not make it part of

527
00:27:06,815 --> 00:27:07,295
the agreement.

528
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:11,781
There's a lot of reasons why. Obviously, you know, SQL and

529
00:27:11,801 --> 00:27:14,464
things like that. But that ends up being one of the most

530
00:27:14,524 --> 00:27:17,748
important parts of this. And it strangely still comes up in

531
00:27:17,808 --> 00:27:21,372
conversations we have like, do you guys want IP? And if they

532
00:27:21,392 --> 00:27:24,636
want IP, that's a whole other level. You should absolutely

533
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:27,439
hold on to it. But owning it is just kind of a part of it.

534
00:27:29,448 --> 00:27:33,910
and be mindful how your IP is being presented. And how it's

535
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:37,171
being positioned overall. If there's damage done to it while

536
00:27:37,251 --> 00:27:39,833
you are promoting the game, marketing game, it doesn't just

537
00:27:39,893 --> 00:27:42,834
affect that game, it affects your studio and it affects any

538
00:27:42,874 --> 00:27:46,876
future games in that series. And the last part is from the best

539
00:27:46,936 --> 00:27:49,277
movie of all time, Spaceballs.

540
00:27:50,037 --> 00:27:53,061
and the idea is your IP is not just your game, remember that,

541
00:27:53,181 --> 00:27:56,324
it is about any sort of opportunities that exist within

542
00:27:56,384 --> 00:27:59,968
it. So whether it's T-shirts, comic books that are made,

543
00:28:00,449 --> 00:28:03,172
movies, feature length film, down well the movie which is

544
00:28:03,212 --> 00:28:06,275
coming to theaters next year. Is it? Okay, good.

545
00:28:10,737 --> 00:28:15,078
I got the IP. But it's something important to keep in mind that

546
00:28:15,118 --> 00:28:19,119
it's not just the game itself. These things do not let a

547
00:28:19,179 --> 00:28:22,620
partner, whoever it is, mess with how your game is presented

548
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:26,701
and how your IP is presented. I want to have a whole other

549
00:28:26,801 --> 00:28:29,082
quiet talk in a room with each and every one of you about

550
00:28:29,122 --> 00:28:32,583
agreements. Do not settle, do not assume anything in

551
00:28:32,623 --> 00:28:35,624
agreement. Ask the questions, it's your right to do it.

552
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:41,912
one example, please, please, please be very clear on how the

553
00:28:41,952 --> 00:28:44,954
money flows into the game and back out of the project when

554
00:28:44,974 --> 00:28:48,536
it's done. There's a whole other talk that would be way more

555
00:28:48,576 --> 00:28:50,317
boring than this one but it's really important of

556
00:28:50,877 --> 00:28:53,398
understanding how your game is going to be recouped, how the

557
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:56,320
cost the publisher might put out there might recoup them, how

558
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,261
they're going to recoup, when they're going to be recouped

559
00:28:58,281 --> 00:29:01,083
because it could be the difference between how much

560
00:29:01,163 --> 00:29:03,924
money you're making like not only short term but long term

561
00:29:03,964 --> 00:29:04,264
as well.

562
00:29:05,305 --> 00:29:09,168
can be very tricky so ask for examples. One thing we do is we

563
00:29:09,188 --> 00:29:12,611
provide a spreadsheet where you can literally see where the

564
00:29:12,651 --> 00:29:15,474
money is going in and you type in the unit sold and the average

565
00:29:15,514 --> 00:29:19,017
unit price and it tells you, shows you exactly how it comes

566
00:29:19,077 --> 00:29:21,760
back out. I think this is so important because you do not

567
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,362
want to be wrong on something like that. Especially after the

568
00:29:24,402 --> 00:29:24,602
fact.

569
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:30,668
And then I put lock your shit up to developers. Make sure you

570
00:29:30,708 --> 00:29:34,371
have clear agreements amongst yourselves and the freelancers

571
00:29:34,411 --> 00:29:38,855
you work with. We can't help you. If you had an agreement, a

572
00:29:39,055 --> 00:29:42,498
handshake, chest bump or whatever it is about the music

573
00:29:42,518 --> 00:29:46,080
or about some freelance work, if you don't have an agreement,

574
00:29:46,301 --> 00:29:48,763
there's nothing we can do about it as a publisher. That's the

575
00:29:48,783 --> 00:29:52,065
agreement you made. And oftentimes people start asking,

576
00:29:52,786 --> 00:29:54,988
what do I do? Can you guys pay them this money?

577
00:29:55,713 --> 00:29:57,635
and that's not in our agreement. It becomes a really tough

578
00:29:57,675 --> 00:30:00,537
conversation to have. So make sure that you understand, you

579
00:30:00,558 --> 00:30:02,700
know, have a very clear understanding, ideally in

580
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:06,023
agreement with other people you work with. And the last piece is

581
00:30:06,083 --> 00:30:09,846
poor communication. Do not save changes to the very end when

582
00:30:09,866 --> 00:30:13,029
you're working with a partner like, or a publisher or a

583
00:30:13,049 --> 00:30:13,290
partner.

584
00:30:14,235 --> 00:30:16,658
you need to, if the game is going to be late, bring it up

585
00:30:16,718 --> 00:30:19,320
as soon as you think it's going to be late. Because that helps

586
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,043
everyone including yourself involved. Having, you know,

587
00:30:22,183 --> 00:30:24,986
making, knowing who the decision makers are, talking to them and

588
00:30:25,006 --> 00:30:27,548
being very informed back and forth of what's going on is

589
00:30:27,588 --> 00:30:29,991
super important. I know it's pretty generic to say like have

590
00:30:30,011 --> 00:30:34,135
good communication, but I can't emphasize it enough. You are in

591
00:30:34,155 --> 00:30:34,875
charge of your game.

592
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:37,540
make sure you're in charge of your game. Stay in charge of

593
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,281
your game. And the last part is related to what we talked about

594
00:30:40,301 --> 00:30:43,203
before, sustainability. I think that's a huge thing that people

595
00:30:43,223 --> 00:30:46,425
don't think about. At least we see it with developers we work

596
00:30:46,445 --> 00:30:50,708
with and developers we don't. Is understanding sustainability for

597
00:30:50,768 --> 00:30:52,650
publisher and your sustainability.

598
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:55,811
If you sign on with somebody, like I said, there's lots of

599
00:30:55,851 --> 00:30:58,632
them out there that call themselves publishers. You need

600
00:30:58,652 --> 00:31:00,893
to do your research, like we're talking about, that they're

601
00:31:00,913 --> 00:31:03,394
going to be around when your game launches. Because if you

602
00:31:03,414 --> 00:31:06,696
sign a deal and they go away, that's really, really going to

603
00:31:06,736 --> 00:31:10,618
hurt you and your situation. So kind of know who funds them,

604
00:31:10,838 --> 00:31:12,639
right? Who's funding that developer? Excuse me, who's

605
00:31:12,659 --> 00:31:15,660
funding that publisher? How do they have money? And what are

606
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,381
they going to do? Are they going to be around? Right?

607
00:31:18,161 --> 00:31:20,762
but also don't plan for yourself. Plan on your funding.

608
00:31:20,802 --> 00:31:23,243
When you're pitching, do not low ball a publisher. That helps

609
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:26,344
nobody. You need to understand what's going to take to launch

610
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:29,045
your game and then what's going to take for those two or three

611
00:31:29,105 --> 00:31:31,646
months after your game is launched. When people start,

612
00:31:31,786 --> 00:31:34,847
when the money starts coming in, you know, Steam, Playstation,

613
00:31:34,867 --> 00:31:37,848
they all pay. It's not like someone buys the game and they

614
00:31:37,868 --> 00:31:41,189
hand you your money. It takes months sometimes, six weeks to

615
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:44,410
two months for your money to come through. So if you've only

616
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:46,251
funded your game up to release.

617
00:31:47,031 --> 00:31:49,853
you might have two months that you don't have any money coming

618
00:31:49,893 --> 00:31:53,475
in. And we see this time and time again and it's fine. We

619
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:56,036
can keep advancing people but I think it's good because if

620
00:31:56,076 --> 00:31:58,778
you're in an agreement and the money runs out and you really

621
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:01,820
need money and you ask them for more, they could ask for royalty

622
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,881
change and things like that. Things you don't want to get

623
00:32:03,901 --> 00:32:03,981
into.

624
00:32:05,557 --> 00:32:08,078
And also have an idea what your next project is if possible.

625
00:32:08,438 --> 00:32:11,019
It's always good if something doesn't go well you're not

626
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:13,641
spinning your wheels for a few months wondering what am I going

627
00:32:13,661 --> 00:32:16,582
to do next. I know that's easier said than done from the

628
00:32:16,622 --> 00:32:20,864
publisher up here. What do I have up here? Provocative

629
00:32:20,904 --> 00:32:21,305
recap.

630
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:28,604
So there's lots of publishing options that a lot of people to do a lot of things very important to understand what that publisher

631
00:32:28,624 --> 00:32:33,252
You're working with what they do what their angle is you know what they do. Well what they might not do as well

632
00:32:34,213 --> 00:32:37,759
Understand your partner complete, and you know everything you can about that partner

633
00:32:38,607 --> 00:32:40,928
and the last part, second to last part is you're in charge

634
00:32:40,968 --> 00:32:44,070
so stay in charge. Never forget that. Never forget you're the

635
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:47,611
one that made this game. Ultimately they need you more

636
00:32:47,631 --> 00:32:49,752
than you need them. You can self publish if you want to and

637
00:32:49,932 --> 00:32:53,854
that's my last point. Self publish. I mean there's a lot of

638
00:32:53,894 --> 00:32:57,136
people that do it very successfully and it's much better

639
00:32:57,196 --> 00:32:59,437
than getting into a bad deal. I know there might be tough

640
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:03,238
situations you might be in but you know, you don't need a

641
00:33:03,278 --> 00:33:05,680
fucking publisher. So you can self publish if you need to.

642
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,220
It's better than being in a bad agreement.

643
00:33:08,517 --> 00:33:12,400
And now if you have any questions, I'm happy to answer

644
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:22,666
them. No questions. Apparently no questions. But thank you very

645
00:33:22,706 --> 00:33:23,306
much for coming out.
