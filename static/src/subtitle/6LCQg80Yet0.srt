00:00:06,272 --> 00:00:10,605
Hello everybody, my name is Emmanuel Kondo, I'm a freelance game designer.

2
00:00:11,973 --> 00:00:16,615
I've been working on several games such as Endless Legend and Event Zero.

3
00:00:17,215 --> 00:00:21,016
I'm also a narrative design teacher in a video game school.

4
00:00:21,756 --> 00:00:25,838
And today we are going to speak about Event Zero

5
00:00:26,418 --> 00:00:29,519
and in a more generic way about chatbot games.

6
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:33,281
So just a first question to start, who in this room

7
00:00:33,621 --> 00:00:37,602
knows a bit about the game or even has played it? You can raise your hand. Okay.

8
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:38,991
some people call.

9
00:00:40,032 --> 00:00:42,275
So to everyone to be at the same page,

10
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:45,658
we are just going to start with the teaser of the game,

11
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:51,405
and we'll talk a bit about the gameplay later.

12
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:54,708
Do you dream of distant planets, stars, and galaxies?

13
00:00:54,849 --> 00:00:57,331
Are you ready for the most transformative experience

14
00:00:57,371 --> 00:00:57,832
of your life?

15
00:01:13,694 --> 00:01:14,454
at your service.

16
00:01:14,534 --> 00:01:17,175
I could be with you wherever I am.

17
00:01:17,275 --> 00:01:32,060
I'm going to tell you how to get out of here,

18
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:38,542
just keep asking yourself questions.

19
00:01:39,602 --> 00:01:42,683
Double-click your message.

20
00:02:00,015 --> 00:02:01,616
So this game is Even Zero.

21
00:02:02,676 --> 00:02:06,899
It's a game where you play an astronaut lost in an empty spaceship.

22
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:13,523
All the crew has disappeared and you have to convince the main computer of the ship to bring you back to Earth.

23
00:02:14,703 --> 00:02:18,806
The thing is, the main gameplay is on typing text.

24
00:02:19,026 --> 00:02:21,267
You can ask anything you want to the computer.

25
00:02:22,007 --> 00:02:25,529
And the computer can disobey you depending on your relationship.

26
00:02:27,544 --> 00:02:29,545
So yeah, it's a chatbot game.

27
00:02:30,046 --> 00:02:32,367
And chatbot games are very niche.

28
00:02:32,747 --> 00:02:35,930
There are only a few of them that exist in the world.

29
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:39,853
You can basically count them with the fingers of one hand.

30
00:02:40,873 --> 00:02:45,336
Here are three of the, I guess, most popular chatbot games that I know.

31
00:02:46,057 --> 00:02:51,541
The first one is Upward and Click, which was written by Douglas Adams in the 90s.

32
00:02:53,069 --> 00:03:01,111
Facade is probably the most famous chatbot game, and it's very interesting, and we'll speak a bit about it later in this talk.

33
00:03:01,891 --> 00:03:10,614
The third chatbot game here is a flash game that you can find for free on the internet, and which has very similar themes to EventZero.

34
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,082
I like to classify games this way.

35
00:03:16,123 --> 00:03:19,946
You have first the good old system games like Super Mario,

36
00:03:20,427 --> 00:03:23,269
and these games basically work like that.

37
00:03:23,389 --> 00:03:26,412
You push a button, your avatar performs an action,

38
00:03:26,932 --> 00:03:29,754
and this action has impact on the game system.

39
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:33,718
And all of this is constant.

40
00:03:34,098 --> 00:03:35,879
The action will always be the same,

41
00:03:35,899 --> 00:03:39,102
and the impact will always be the same.

42
00:03:39,962 --> 00:03:41,624
And then you have semantic games.

43
00:03:42,164 --> 00:03:45,047
And semantic games don't work because of a combination

44
00:03:45,608 --> 00:03:47,570
of gears of your game system.

45
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,572
It doesn't work because of that.

46
00:03:50,092 --> 00:03:55,738
But semantic games are based on a huge database.

47
00:03:56,465 --> 00:03:58,646
which have been written by game designers.

48
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:00,727
And if we take for example Scribblenauts,

49
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,589
Scribblenauts is a game where you can type words

50
00:04:03,909 --> 00:04:06,591
and these words appear in your game level.

51
00:04:06,891 --> 00:04:08,612
For example if you type plane,

52
00:04:08,712 --> 00:04:10,293
there will be a plane in your level

53
00:04:10,413 --> 00:04:12,995
and the player will be able to interact with this plane.

54
00:04:13,615 --> 00:04:15,196
as with a real plane.

55
00:04:15,776 --> 00:04:19,618
And the system is not able to understand what a plane is

56
00:04:19,638 --> 00:04:20,958
and to generate it.

57
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:25,701
It has to be based on a database

58
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:29,423
where the game designer had to explain what a plane was.

59
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:32,824
Chatbot games are semantic games.

60
00:04:32,844 --> 00:04:36,026
They are just a subcategory of it.

61
00:04:36,786 --> 00:04:41,068
And as semantic games, it depends mostly on the database.

62
00:04:42,201 --> 00:04:46,804
It's important to understand that chatbot games are not text adventure games.

63
00:04:47,424 --> 00:04:51,387
You know, these kind of games that were very popular in the 80s.

64
00:04:53,068 --> 00:04:58,611
In such games like Zork, for example, the player has to type an action and a target

65
00:04:58,871 --> 00:05:00,452
to progress in the adventure.

66
00:05:00,512 --> 00:05:04,434
For example, you can type open door and it will probably open the door.

67
00:05:05,575 --> 00:05:12,137
And the challenge here is to guess what is a good action and a good target.

68
00:05:12,557 --> 00:05:14,297
So basically they are kind of riddles.

69
00:05:15,778 --> 00:05:20,239
But chatbot games focus more on the natural language part.

70
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:28,542
In chatbot games you have to talk in plain English to a character and a roleplay.

71
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,382
So for me text adventure games...

72
00:05:33,799 --> 00:05:36,041
works on a more rational part of the brain

73
00:05:36,462 --> 00:05:41,707
when chatbot games work with a more emotional part of the brain.

74
00:05:43,588 --> 00:05:49,654
So now that all of that has been stated, what I suggest is with this talk

75
00:05:49,834 --> 00:05:52,396
giving you some cues to make your own chatbot game.

76
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:57,241
At first we have to start with the basics.

77
00:05:58,469 --> 00:06:04,551
When you want to work on a chatbot game, as every other kind of game, you have to define what is your game experience.

78
00:06:05,152 --> 00:06:11,434
And it's important to understand that the experience of chatbot games is basically narrative.

79
00:06:11,974 --> 00:06:21,298
Chatbot games are narrative games, story-driven games, and you have to understand that to write efficiently your chatbot.

80
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:27,682
Chatbots are characters like any other character, like in any other kind of fiction.

81
00:06:28,042 --> 00:06:30,944
And you have to ask yourself some questions like,

82
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:33,005
what is your chatbot motivation?

83
00:06:33,485 --> 00:06:34,025
Who made it?

84
00:06:34,505 --> 00:06:35,946
Can he or she feel things?

85
00:06:36,607 --> 00:06:38,868
Express love, anxiety, jealousy?

86
00:06:39,688 --> 00:06:41,309
How does it change through the story arc?

87
00:06:42,049 --> 00:06:44,471
What relationships can the player build with it?

88
00:06:45,451 --> 00:06:49,513
And more importantly, what do your chatbot know?

89
00:06:50,474 --> 00:06:54,977
and what does it... don't know basically.

90
00:06:55,277 --> 00:06:58,239
If you can define this, it will be much easier for you

91
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,021
to write for chatbot.

92
00:07:01,722 --> 00:07:04,764
Not only because you will be able to have...

93
00:07:05,523 --> 00:07:07,825
better lines and a better story arc.

94
00:07:08,145 --> 00:07:11,887
But also because you won't fall in the trap of the sentient AI

95
00:07:12,568 --> 00:07:15,210
and you will be able to accept as a writer

96
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,812
that your chatbot doesn't know anything

97
00:07:18,532 --> 00:07:22,995
and there are reasons for that and the player will be able to understand that

98
00:07:23,696 --> 00:07:25,617
and won't have problem with that.

99
00:07:27,687 --> 00:07:34,058
This was on the narrative part, but of course chatbots are systems and you have to build

100
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:38,665
a working system which supports your writing.

101
00:07:39,427 --> 00:07:40,088
And generally...

102
00:07:42,111 --> 00:07:49,495
Today we all use chatbots basically, or at least we know them because we have our smartphones

103
00:07:49,555 --> 00:07:54,998
with their assistants like Siri, there is no Cortana on Windows, and these chatbots

104
00:07:55,258 --> 00:08:01,702
are very efficient but they use very complex systems like neural networks, machine learnings

105
00:08:01,842 --> 00:08:02,803
and all these kind of things.

106
00:08:03,423 --> 00:08:07,765
But the problem with that is the systems are basically black boxes.

107
00:08:08,145 --> 00:08:13,308
They work with an input and an output, but you cannot really dive into them and tweak

108
00:08:13,348 --> 00:08:14,108
the little details.

109
00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:18,010
And you know that us game designers are kind of control freaks.

110
00:08:18,491 --> 00:08:22,553
We like to be able to master everything in the experience.

111
00:08:22,813 --> 00:08:25,874
And it's very important on a narrative game.

112
00:08:26,475 --> 00:08:28,256
So my advice here is...

113
00:08:29,136 --> 00:08:37,460
just make a simple system, a deterministic system that you will be able to write for and to debug, to fully understand.

114
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:44,623
And your chatbot won't be efficient because of its code, but because of its writing.

115
00:08:45,103 --> 00:08:51,045
Because as I was telling you, yes, the database is the most important part of it.

116
00:08:52,046 --> 00:08:55,307
And for example, what you see on this slide is the first version of Event0.

117
00:08:56,067 --> 00:08:58,248
Event0 starts as a paper prototype.

118
00:08:59,577 --> 00:09:05,002
And the first playtest of the game, where Sergei Mohov, the game designer of the game, and I,

119
00:09:05,403 --> 00:09:08,266
sitting at a table and basically running a D&D session.

120
00:09:08,746 --> 00:09:12,230
We were explaining to the player, OK, this is the context, you are in a spaceship,

121
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:14,633
there is a computer in front of you, what do you type?

122
00:09:15,113 --> 00:09:18,977
And then we are giving them a paper and the height to write down the query.

123
00:09:19,868 --> 00:09:22,468
And with us, we had a flowchart with the AI,

124
00:09:23,068 --> 00:09:24,689
and we were following this flowchart.

125
00:09:24,849 --> 00:09:27,629
And without cheating, we were generating an answer

126
00:09:27,809 --> 00:09:28,429
for this player.

127
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:31,850
And we performed this kind of playtest dozens

128
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:32,930
and dozens of times.

129
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:36,631
And we discovered how to handle questions or insults.

130
00:09:37,511 --> 00:09:41,592
And at the end, we had a much more efficient flowchart.

131
00:09:42,452 --> 00:09:45,633
We came to our programmer team and said, OK, this is our AI.

132
00:09:46,293 --> 00:09:49,373
Implement it as you want, but it has to work like this.

133
00:09:50,866 --> 00:09:57,630
Fun anecdote on that is that we figured out that our players were kind of shy when they were writing things in front of us

134
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:00,951
So we made a fake even zero 3d scene

135
00:10:01,692 --> 00:10:06,274
That we put on a computer and we let the players play alone in a room. We are telling them

136
00:10:06,354 --> 00:10:08,215
Okay, this is a real AR, be careful

137
00:10:08,716 --> 00:10:16,400
But the truth is Serga and I were in another room and the players were connected and this way we discover many new insults to handle

138
00:10:19,481 --> 00:10:19,621
So

139
00:10:20,737 --> 00:10:26,179
All of this is very theoretical, so let's start with a concrete example on how it works.

140
00:10:26,739 --> 00:10:31,420
This is a playthrough from Jacksepticeye, the famous YouTuber, playing Even Zero,

141
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,501
and we are going to watch the first scene of the game.

142
00:10:34,521 --> 00:10:36,902
It's one minute long, and I comment it later.

143
00:10:40,043 --> 00:10:42,103
It's a D2 instead of D3. How do I go out?

144
00:10:42,984 --> 00:10:44,544
Open corridor D3.

145
00:10:44,604 --> 00:10:46,905
Open corridor D3.

146
00:10:46,945 --> 00:10:47,125
Fine!

147
00:10:51,562 --> 00:10:52,482
I'll do it here then.

148
00:10:53,223 --> 00:10:55,765
Open corridor...

149
00:10:55,785 --> 00:10:55,805
D3.

150
00:10:55,825 --> 00:10:59,488
You will be eating all the spells I make.

151
00:10:59,688 --> 00:11:03,371
I'm already inclined to obey your orders, but certainly your machines.

152
00:11:03,912 --> 00:11:05,874
Come on, ass, stop getting sassy with me!

153
00:11:06,354 --> 00:11:10,037
Stop... getting... sassy with me.

154
00:11:10,297 --> 00:11:12,699
You seem to really like to play with that.

155
00:11:12,819 --> 00:11:14,781
I'm sure you'll be able to handle it.

156
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:16,743
Oh, what happened?

157
00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:22,683
Woah, what did I do? I'm sorry! Oh god, you are a fucked up AI, aren't you?

158
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:23,384
Ooh!

159
00:11:27,108 --> 00:11:32,794
Okay, so this is a very usual reaction and behavior from a player playing Even Zero.

160
00:11:33,714 --> 00:11:40,341
I think 80% of the players of Even Zero start the game like this, giving orders, like in a text-adventure game.

161
00:11:42,364 --> 00:11:50,533
Our goal as chatbot makers is to change their mind and make them think with the emotional part of the brain.

162
00:11:50,653 --> 00:11:55,359
And it starts by making them treat the chatbot as a sensible being.

163
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:00,645
So what we see in this video is Jacksepticeye keeps asking the same order.

164
00:12:00,885 --> 00:12:02,087
Open the door, open the door.

165
00:12:03,235 --> 00:12:13,023
And the AI is able to count that and is able to realize that the player isn't yet treating it as a sensible being.

166
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:16,548
This scene has just one purpose.

167
00:12:16,808 --> 00:12:20,951
The door won't open as long as the player will give just simple orders.

168
00:12:21,511 --> 00:12:26,914
If the player asks, please, it's a polite word and it's the first step, so the door will open.

169
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:32,437
If the player insults the area, it's also the first step, because starting the moment you insult someone,

170
00:12:32,757 --> 00:12:35,739
it means that you consider it has feelings, you're just mean.

171
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:37,219
But it's still fine.

172
00:12:39,534 --> 00:12:42,275
What we see here is that after several orders,

173
00:12:42,755 --> 00:12:45,116
the AI gives a cue and says,

174
00:12:45,476 --> 00:12:47,797
okay, you know, you just keep repeating orders.

175
00:12:48,377 --> 00:12:49,578
Let's change, let's move on.

176
00:12:50,198 --> 00:12:55,540
And Jaxx-LTKi on Swell stops getting sassy with me.

177
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,181
And this is fine, because starting this moment,

178
00:12:58,261 --> 00:13:02,683
Jaxx-LTKi has accepted to have real conversations

179
00:13:02,903 --> 00:13:03,563
with the AI.

180
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:06,524
So the door opens and Jaxx-LTKi freaks out.

181
00:13:12,609 --> 00:13:15,331
Of course, this is not easy.

182
00:13:15,411 --> 00:13:17,292
This is what we basically call role-play.

183
00:13:17,632 --> 00:13:21,315
Like the player has to play as its avatar.

184
00:13:22,116 --> 00:13:25,278
And I remember a player I had during a playtest

185
00:13:25,418 --> 00:13:28,420
was keeping giving orders to the AI.

186
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:32,003
And after a moment, it was 20 minutes like that.

187
00:13:33,544 --> 00:13:35,265
We hadn't this system yet.

188
00:13:35,285 --> 00:13:38,487
I came to him and told him,

189
00:13:38,647 --> 00:13:40,589
OK, you can have a real conversation.

190
00:13:40,609 --> 00:13:40,909
Just try.

191
00:13:42,153 --> 00:13:44,440
And he looked at me and said, well, I...

192
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,543
I know, but I don't want to feel stupid in front of you.

193
00:13:49,243 --> 00:13:55,428
And the thing is, it can be very intimate to perform a roleplay

194
00:13:56,249 --> 00:13:59,832
and to try to be emotionally involved in this game,

195
00:13:59,892 --> 00:14:05,457
especially because players are not really used to do this like that,

196
00:14:05,597 --> 00:14:07,058
to have to put their own words.

197
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,521
Generally, they just have to pick some dialogues, pre-written dialogues.

198
00:14:12,062 --> 00:14:12,143
And...

199
00:14:13,197 --> 00:14:18,900
As a game designer, you have to help them, to give them the tools to do it easily.

200
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,663
And one of the first thing is to let them define their avatar,

201
00:14:25,044 --> 00:14:28,566
give them some lore, some explanation about the context,

202
00:14:28,986 --> 00:14:31,228
so they don't feel naked in your game.

203
00:14:31,828 --> 00:14:35,590
But at the end, not all players will like your game.

204
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,871
And we had this problem with EventZero.

205
00:14:38,391 --> 00:14:42,172
We saw that because the game was very simple,

206
00:14:42,212 --> 00:14:45,514
you know, you didn't need any obscure gaming culture

207
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:48,895
or some super-firm to master Gamepad.

208
00:14:49,775 --> 00:14:52,156
You just needed to type text,

209
00:14:52,356 --> 00:14:53,756
and basically everybody does that today.

210
00:14:55,017 --> 00:14:56,957
We thought that everybody would love the game.

211
00:14:56,977 --> 00:15:00,118
But the truth is, as any other kind of game,

212
00:15:00,478 --> 00:15:02,139
you have a target, you have a market.

213
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,424
and you have to aim at these people,

214
00:15:05,484 --> 00:15:07,907
but you won't be able to please everybody,

215
00:15:07,988 --> 00:15:09,610
so don't fool yourself with that.

216
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:17,021
So I keep repeating that but the writing for a chatbot is the most important part.

217
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,862
It's more important than the technical aspect.

218
00:15:20,643 --> 00:15:29,307
And the writing is not easy and doesn't look like the writing of other kind of games.

219
00:15:30,068 --> 00:15:32,449
First, there is a lot of writing.

220
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:38,612
And what is kind of frustrating is that only one percent of the player

221
00:15:41,262 --> 00:15:49,703
I mean, players will see 1% of the writing, but at the end, every player will see the

222
00:15:49,803 --> 00:15:51,724
whole thing you have written.

223
00:15:52,824 --> 00:16:02,646
So you have to accept that you're writing for only a few of them, and at the same time

224
00:16:02,706 --> 00:16:06,226
you have to anticipate any kind of craze.

225
00:16:06,971 --> 00:16:13,115
But of course you cannot do that. You cannot guess every query the player will be able to say.

226
00:16:14,356 --> 00:16:20,080
And fortunately we figured out some tricks to not fail with our chatbot.

227
00:16:21,761 --> 00:16:28,425
I guess there are two golden rules with writing for chatbot. The first thing is, you know,

228
00:16:28,646 --> 00:16:34,890
your chatbot most of the time won't understand the player. But never tell them. Don't tell them

229
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,351
when you failed to understand.

230
00:16:37,584 --> 00:16:39,986
Never answer, I don't understand, can you repeat the query?

231
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:43,429
But write evasive outputs.

232
00:16:43,889 --> 00:16:45,510
Answer with open questions.

233
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:47,532
Think like horoscopes, you know.

234
00:16:48,712 --> 00:16:54,954
And we even had a smart trick, it was to pick one word we had understood from the query

235
00:16:55,494 --> 00:16:58,435
and formulate an elsewhere which was using that word.

236
00:16:58,955 --> 00:17:03,456
So for example, if the player asks, there is a character in the story,

237
00:17:04,116 --> 00:17:07,697
even Zero, who is called Nandi, and if the player asks,

238
00:17:08,617 --> 00:17:13,039
what is the favorite kind of music of Nandi? And the AI fails to understand that,

239
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,539
it will detect Nandi.

240
00:17:15,399 --> 00:17:17,280
it will detect that there is a question mark

241
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,440
and it will answer something like,

242
00:17:19,461 --> 00:17:22,522
you know, Nandi's privacy is very important to me.

243
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:25,022
Stop asking questions about her.

244
00:17:26,443 --> 00:17:28,784
For the player, the player won't feel like

245
00:17:28,824 --> 00:17:30,804
the AI isn't asking them,

246
00:17:31,144 --> 00:17:34,346
but more like the AI is hiding something to them

247
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:37,767
and they will be like, ooh, this is suspicious.

248
00:17:38,967 --> 00:17:40,688
And that works, that's pretty effective.

249
00:17:41,068 --> 00:17:42,508
The second golden rule is

250
00:17:43,627 --> 00:17:46,250
when you understand your player, because it happens sometimes,

251
00:17:47,071 --> 00:17:50,976
tell them and be very specific about what you understood.

252
00:17:51,536 --> 00:17:54,480
For example, sometimes in Event 0,

253
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,905
there are scenes where the AI doesn't want to open the door,

254
00:17:59,145 --> 00:17:59,606
as you have seen.

255
00:18:00,934 --> 00:18:06,038
If the player asks, open the door please, and you answer, well I don't know.

256
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:09,841
This answer could fit with anything else.

257
00:18:10,461 --> 00:18:14,624
And the player will be like, I'm not even sure the AI understood.

258
00:18:15,384 --> 00:18:19,107
But if you answer, I don't know if I can open the door to you.

259
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:28,534
This works much better and it lets the player move on to something else.

260
00:18:29,879 --> 00:18:33,282
So yeah, anticipate and make magic.

261
00:18:35,443 --> 00:18:38,546
But you have to be very careful with one thing.

262
00:18:39,639 --> 00:18:42,562
You have one trap to avoid, absolutely.

263
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:44,343
It's the chatbot loop.

264
00:18:44,744 --> 00:18:48,447
The moment when your chatbot starts repeating itself.

265
00:18:48,967 --> 00:18:53,611
Because at this moment, the player breaks his suspension of disbelief

266
00:18:54,052 --> 00:18:57,635
and realizes they are playing just a video game.

267
00:18:57,975 --> 00:18:59,937
They are not talking to a real character.

268
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:03,531
And there are different ways to avoid that.

269
00:19:04,051 --> 00:19:06,492
The first obvious way is to write a lot.

270
00:19:07,092 --> 00:19:08,573
And what you see, for example, on this slide

271
00:19:08,593 --> 00:19:11,774
is 20 answers just for the question, why?

272
00:19:12,134 --> 00:19:14,335
Why question mark in any context?

273
00:19:14,675 --> 00:19:15,995
And even zero has 20 answers.

274
00:19:16,135 --> 00:19:18,236
And this is also true for what question mark,

275
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:20,436
or who question mark, et cetera.

276
00:19:21,497 --> 00:19:27,084
But of course you cannot write 10 and 10 of text.

277
00:19:27,605 --> 00:19:30,729
So another thing we did in Even Zero was.

278
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:38,133
building a system which was able to pick a part of a sentence and mix it with a part of another sentence.

279
00:19:38,714 --> 00:19:42,036
And this way we were able to generate two millions of lines.

280
00:19:42,776 --> 00:19:44,957
So it was very effective.

281
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:49,700
Of course, if you would play the game for hours, you will be able to figure out some patterns.

282
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,381
But it works pretty well.

283
00:19:55,317 --> 00:20:01,664
Another thing we did was, you know, generally the chatbot loop happens when players ask

284
00:20:01,924 --> 00:20:09,492
the same question over and over, like kids basically, and we made the system able to

285
00:20:09,572 --> 00:20:12,155
count the amount of time a question has been asked.

286
00:20:12,495 --> 00:20:17,037
And then we had special warnings, like, oops, we are going to fall in a loop, we have to do something.

287
00:20:17,377 --> 00:20:21,959
And the AI was saying things like, you know, it's been six times, you ask the same question,

288
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:26,141
come on, go on, say something else. And the player was like, wow, the AI is so smart.

289
00:20:28,743 --> 00:20:34,705
But I want to be crystal clear with you, your AI will never be perfect.

290
00:20:35,506 --> 00:20:39,228
And you have to embrace it. You have to accept that.

291
00:20:40,959 --> 00:20:49,691
you cannot reach perfection so stop making effort in that and it's better to

292
00:20:50,592 --> 00:20:55,780
make a narrative where you AI fails fit in. What we had in UN0 was

293
00:20:57,556 --> 00:21:05,283
Basically, the AI is part of an old spaceship and this spaceship is broken, has been lost

294
00:21:05,463 --> 00:21:07,084
in space for 30 years.

295
00:21:07,525 --> 00:21:13,329
The AI was going to be crazy and there are glitches on the screen.

296
00:21:13,349 --> 00:21:16,152
The screen looks like 80s technology, you know.

297
00:21:16,572 --> 00:21:17,793
So when there is a bug.

298
00:21:18,414 --> 00:21:21,055
Players feel like, oh, this ship is so broken.

299
00:21:21,515 --> 00:21:23,096
But if you take a game like Facade,

300
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:24,477
the game I was talking at the beginning,

301
00:21:24,978 --> 00:21:27,679
which involves this time, two humans,

302
00:21:27,959 --> 00:21:30,161
the chatbots play the role of two humans.

303
00:21:31,001 --> 00:21:34,763
When the chatbot bugs, you basically see humans bugging.

304
00:21:34,783 --> 00:21:37,405
This is very unnatural.

305
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:38,586
It's like uncanny.

306
00:21:40,607 --> 00:21:45,269
This breaks the immersion, because the flows don't

307
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,590
fit with the narrative.

308
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:50,842
Let's speak a bit about the pipeline.

309
00:21:52,503 --> 00:21:56,006
Since you will have a lot of writing, you need to have a strong pipeline.

310
00:21:56,767 --> 00:22:00,190
And the first thing that comes is the tools.

311
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:04,893
And this is for example a screenshot for the tool we made for EventZero.

312
00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:09,750
An important thing to know is that tools shape your AI.

313
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:12,011
And this is true for any kind of game.

314
00:22:12,091 --> 00:22:15,432
When you make a tool, it shapes your design, it shapes your content.

315
00:22:15,912 --> 00:22:22,695
And if it shapes it in a way you didn't intend to go to,

316
00:22:22,715 --> 00:22:27,037
it's going to be kind of difficult to make the game you want.

317
00:22:28,022 --> 00:22:33,964
So make sure to allow you to write a lot of text, to edit it, to search your database,

318
00:22:34,084 --> 00:22:42,647
to make easy iterations. Make sure your tools allow your translators to make the localization right.

319
00:22:44,408 --> 00:22:50,950
And make sure your tools allow you to debug your AI because it should be a big part of your job.

320
00:22:53,065 --> 00:22:56,227
And another thing which is kind of important is playtest.

321
00:22:56,868 --> 00:23:00,271
Of course, again, playtest are important in any kind of games.

322
00:23:00,691 --> 00:23:05,515
But for even zero and chatbot games in generic way,

323
00:23:05,915 --> 00:23:08,157
we had to anticipate what the player will say.

324
00:23:08,517 --> 00:23:09,998
So all the production was.

325
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:14,921
turning around the playtest. Every weekend we had a playtest and during the week

326
00:23:15,401 --> 00:23:21,364
the team was implementing the new worlds by reading the logs from the players and we did

327
00:23:21,404 --> 00:23:26,266
that for months and months and months. But as I told you sooner...

328
00:23:27,536 --> 00:23:32,160
don't fall in this trap, don't aim for perfection, you won't reach perfection.

329
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:36,263
So you have to tell yourself, stop.

330
00:23:36,503 --> 00:23:40,546
You have to be able to freeze content, you have to be able to accept that

331
00:23:40,926 --> 00:23:48,332
you won't playtest a scene because there will always be new words to add to your database.

332
00:23:50,493 --> 00:23:57,661
You have to figure out when it's ready, when you can accept this state of the game.

333
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:06,201
And the last thing on your pipeline is localization.

334
00:24:06,961 --> 00:24:10,162
And as you can guess, it's true for narrative games

335
00:24:10,222 --> 00:24:11,183
in generic way.

336
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:14,803
Some games are very hard to localize

337
00:24:14,863 --> 00:24:16,784
because of the big amount of text.

338
00:24:18,424 --> 00:24:21,005
But it's especially true for chatbot games

339
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:23,446
because the system of the chatbot

340
00:24:24,126 --> 00:24:25,906
depends also on the language.

341
00:24:26,307 --> 00:24:27,927
Languages work very differently.

342
00:24:29,623 --> 00:24:35,508
We had this problem with Even Zero, half of the game has been funded by the French government

343
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:39,471
and it comes with one condition, translate the game in French.

344
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,754
But we were like, we will do that at the end.

345
00:24:47,578 --> 00:24:51,081
And we finally achieved to release the game in French.

346
00:24:52,539 --> 00:24:53,359
God, it's terrible.

347
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:55,501
Just don't play it in French.

348
00:24:55,561 --> 00:24:56,861
And I'm very sorry.

349
00:24:56,901 --> 00:24:58,562
Je suis vraiment désolé to all the French people

350
00:24:58,603 --> 00:24:59,223
who play the game.

351
00:24:59,243 --> 00:25:00,744
It just does not work.

352
00:25:01,004 --> 00:25:03,806
And the thing is, if you want to make chatbot games,

353
00:25:03,846 --> 00:25:04,887
you can localize them.

354
00:25:05,267 --> 00:25:07,388
But you have, before starting the game,

355
00:25:07,708 --> 00:25:10,470
you have to ask yourself, in what language

356
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:11,511
your game will be.

357
00:25:12,131 --> 00:25:14,473
And prepare your tools, prepare your system

358
00:25:14,893 --> 00:25:16,394
to fit with those languages.

359
00:25:17,623 --> 00:25:22,905
because one difficult thing is writing for chatbot is very technical.

360
00:25:23,891 --> 00:25:28,712
And if you want to work for example with translators, with a localization company,

361
00:25:30,093 --> 00:25:34,594
they will need to access your tools, they will need to understand your system.

362
00:25:34,614 --> 00:25:37,854
This is going to be difficult.

363
00:25:38,115 --> 00:25:42,916
We had some mails at the release of EventZero from Chinese companies,

364
00:25:42,956 --> 00:25:47,877
for example, or Japanese companies, they wanted to translate EventZero in Chinese or in Japanese.

365
00:25:49,975 --> 00:25:52,877
Every time we answer with, yeah, fine,

366
00:25:52,997 --> 00:25:55,278
just we won't touch a line of code,

367
00:25:55,338 --> 00:25:58,180
so do as you want and keep as much money as you want

368
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:02,343
for the sales, but we won't touch that.

369
00:26:02,723 --> 00:26:04,724
And they were, okay, just show us how it works.

370
00:26:05,425 --> 00:26:06,305
And we are showing them,

371
00:26:06,726 --> 00:26:09,207
and we will never get any answer,

372
00:26:09,667 --> 00:26:12,129
because they knew how difficult it would be.

373
00:26:14,994 --> 00:26:22,659
Okay, now I guess I have given you enough hints to start your own chatbot games

374
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:27,522
and I really want you to make chatbot games because I think it has a strong potential.

375
00:26:27,923 --> 00:26:33,987
I'm very happy to see that this year at IGF there is a chatbot game, Don't Make Love,

376
00:26:34,687 --> 00:26:37,389
that you can play. It's on the exposition part.

377
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:40,471
The last thing that I want to tell you is that...

378
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:45,222
don't restrain you to keep on.

379
00:26:45,362 --> 00:26:48,123
You can make chatbot games that don't involve tapping.

380
00:26:48,483 --> 00:26:51,325
Basically, chatbot is just conversation.

381
00:26:51,405 --> 00:26:53,946
It's just bonding with an NPC, just

382
00:26:54,286 --> 00:26:56,608
having an intimate and unique relationship

383
00:26:56,728 --> 00:27:00,670
that other players won't have because they didn't communicate

384
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:01,610
the way you did.

385
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:05,632
And for example, this game, like Captain Blood and Citian,

386
00:27:05,652 --> 00:27:07,613
for example, are two games that

387
00:27:08,852 --> 00:27:13,835
or chatbot games definitely, but don't work with keyboards. You have to select symbols

388
00:27:14,015 --> 00:27:20,520
from an alien language and use them to form sentences and translate the answers.

389
00:27:21,502 --> 00:27:24,524
The last one is an interactive fiction, Google Home,

390
00:27:25,664 --> 00:27:28,666
but you interact with the device in natural language.

391
00:27:30,267 --> 00:27:32,849
And it's kind of a weak chatbot, but perhaps it

392
00:27:33,369 --> 00:27:34,250
could be a chatbot game.

393
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:38,473
And you can imagine any kind of game, like, for example,

394
00:27:38,513 --> 00:27:40,414
games where you communicate with gestures.

395
00:27:41,815 --> 00:27:44,417
For example, The Last Guardian is not a chatbot game,

396
00:27:44,437 --> 00:27:46,878
of course, but it's perhaps a small step

397
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:49,600
to this kind of game.

398
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:50,861
So yeah, just.

399
00:27:51,561 --> 00:27:53,862
It's a bit cliche to say that, think outside the box

400
00:27:53,982 --> 00:27:56,802
and do your best with chatbots.

401
00:27:58,263 --> 00:28:02,363
OK, I would like to thank Sergey Mohov, who is just here.

402
00:28:02,504 --> 00:28:03,964
He was our game designer of the game

403
00:28:04,084 --> 00:28:06,524
and helped me a lot with the talk.

404
00:28:08,045 --> 00:28:11,486
If you have any question, I'd be glad to answer yours.

405
00:28:12,166 --> 00:28:15,126
And this has nothing to do with the talk,

406
00:28:15,146 --> 00:28:17,767
but after the presentation, you can reach me

407
00:28:17,807 --> 00:28:19,247
and we could speak on unions.

408
00:28:19,427 --> 00:28:21,008
I'm part of the first.

409
00:28:21,689 --> 00:28:27,266
French video game unions in France and they have nothing to say on this topic so feel free to ask me your questions.

410
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:28,229
Thank you very much.

411
00:28:38,352 --> 00:28:40,253
Hi, Chair Benz from Microsoft.

412
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:44,076
You mentioned neural networks being kind of frustrating me

413
00:28:44,096 --> 00:28:46,097
because they're a black box and not easy to tweak.

414
00:28:46,177 --> 00:28:49,079
So I'm curious what you did for processing input.

415
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:51,481
Do you guys still try to do some kind of natural language

416
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:51,981
processing?

417
00:28:52,041 --> 00:28:54,663
Or how do you identify the user's intents, et cetera?

418
00:28:55,796 --> 00:29:01,919
So for posting inputs, we built a database based on tags,

419
00:29:01,999 --> 00:29:02,459
basically.

420
00:29:02,939 --> 00:29:07,601
Like every word with a similar meaning has a common tag.

421
00:29:07,661 --> 00:29:12,103
For example, murder, kill, et cetera, has the tag death.

422
00:29:12,864 --> 00:29:15,526
and when the player types something,

423
00:29:15,906 --> 00:29:19,049
we just check out which types are in this query.

424
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:24,173
And the AI has answer patterns

425
00:29:24,594 --> 00:29:28,577
that are sort with the different tags

426
00:29:29,258 --> 00:29:30,239
that the player can type,

427
00:29:30,819 --> 00:29:32,381
and generate answers this way.

428
00:29:33,622 --> 00:29:34,582
Yeah.

429
00:29:34,943 --> 00:29:35,223
Thank you.

430
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:36,524
Sorry.

431
00:29:46,407 --> 00:29:53,655
Oh, sorry. Yeah, sorry, I'm out of time. So we can go to the wrap-up room to finish the question. Thank you.
