00:00:07,122 --> 00:00:10,323
My name is Jeff Engelstein, and thank you for joining me today

2
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:14,164
to talk a little bit about one of my favorite hobbies,

3
00:00:14,324 --> 00:00:17,185
collecting interesting psychological trivia

4
00:00:17,265 --> 00:00:17,745
and tricks.

5
00:00:18,105 --> 00:00:21,606
And I've become obsessed over the last five or 10 years

6
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:23,626
about loss aversion and all of the aspects

7
00:00:23,646 --> 00:00:25,127
that it has in human psychology.

8
00:00:25,167 --> 00:00:28,447
So I'm excited to share some of that with you today.

9
00:00:29,048 --> 00:00:30,788
So first, a little bit about myself.

10
00:00:31,548 --> 00:00:34,329
So I am a board game designer.

11
00:00:36,008 --> 00:00:37,569
I've done about 10 games now.

12
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:40,371
Some of my bigger ones were Space Cadets, Dragon and Flag,

13
00:00:40,391 --> 00:00:42,432
and Fog of War, which was recently released.

14
00:00:42,552 --> 00:00:47,275
And I have my first licensed game, The Expanse,

15
00:00:47,355 --> 00:00:50,597
coming out, which I'm excited about probably around June.

16
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:53,399
Since this is a video game conference,

17
00:00:53,599 --> 00:00:55,861
I will say that I also have two published video games

18
00:00:55,901 --> 00:00:56,561
for the Apple II.

19
00:00:58,085 --> 00:01:01,388
which you probably can't get anymore, Star Blaster and Panic Button,

20
00:01:02,369 --> 00:01:06,132
both published in around 1982, 83, something like that.

21
00:01:08,014 --> 00:01:10,075
And some of you also may know me from my podcasts.

22
00:01:10,296 --> 00:01:12,477
I'm on the Dice Tower podcast.

23
00:01:12,518 --> 00:01:13,779
I do the game tech segment there.

24
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,943
And also the long form, about an hour-long podcast called Ludology,

25
00:01:19,183 --> 00:01:22,206
which talks about game design and...

26
00:01:23,838 --> 00:01:27,340
gets into the nuts and bolts specifically around board game design, although we do get

27
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:34,445
into a lot of topics. And I also teach board game design at the NYU Game Center for about

28
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:42,990
I've done that for about two years. So, it's a game conference, so I'm going to be playing

29
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:47,093
a bunch of games throughout this, throughout this lecture. So why don't we start by

30
00:01:48,912 --> 00:01:51,313
This one I usually do live and grab somebody,

31
00:01:51,353 --> 00:01:52,394
but in the interest of time,

32
00:01:52,414 --> 00:01:54,856
I planted a stooge in the audience.

33
00:01:55,256 --> 00:01:57,618
Sorry, a volunteer in the audience, Mr. Rob Davio.

34
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,480
Before the conference, before this talk,

35
00:02:01,601 --> 00:02:03,602
I asked Rob, I made him an offer.

36
00:02:04,102 --> 00:02:06,284
I said, I asked him if he had 10 or $20.

37
00:02:06,664 --> 00:02:08,425
He did say that he had a $20 bill,

38
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:11,447
and I offered to make him a wager

39
00:02:11,607 --> 00:02:13,269
that I would put up $20, he can put up $20.

40
00:02:13,369 --> 00:02:15,770
I'd flip a coin, he could call it in the air,

41
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,051
and the winner would take the $40.

42
00:02:18,542 --> 00:02:21,325
And I asked him if that was a wager that he would like to take.

43
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:22,467
And you said...

44
00:02:22,487 --> 00:02:26,070
Only if it'll help your gut.

45
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:26,251
Ha ha ha!

46
00:02:26,871 --> 00:02:29,194
So I asked him to go with his gut, and he said, he said no.

47
00:02:29,414 --> 00:02:30,755
He said he would not take that bet.

48
00:02:31,636 --> 00:02:33,598
Um, that the $20 was his...

49
00:02:33,799 --> 00:02:35,781
That was the lunch money that you had set aside for today.

50
00:02:36,622 --> 00:02:36,782
Um...

51
00:02:38,644 --> 00:02:38,764
And...

52
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,081
made him a couple of other offers.

53
00:02:41,141 --> 00:02:44,704
I said, would you do it if I put up $21 against your $20?

54
00:02:45,145 --> 00:02:46,766
Would you do it if I went up to $22?

55
00:02:47,747 --> 00:02:49,328
And he said that he would do it at $25,

56
00:02:49,568 --> 00:02:51,570
as I recall correctly.

57
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,232
Yes, $25 against my $20, he would take that bet.

58
00:02:56,554 --> 00:02:59,537
And that gets to really the base illustration

59
00:02:59,837 --> 00:03:02,819
of a concept called loss aversion.

60
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,341
And just kind of in a nutshell.

61
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,372
What it's saying is that getting something feels good,

62
00:03:08,893 --> 00:03:13,476
gaining $20 feels good, losing $20 feels bad, okay?

63
00:03:13,676 --> 00:03:16,118
But losing the $20 feels worse

64
00:03:16,518 --> 00:03:17,999
than gaining the $20 feels good.

65
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,241
I've been trying to come up with a more elegant way

66
00:03:20,281 --> 00:03:22,182
to say that for a long time and I have failed,

67
00:03:22,282 --> 00:03:23,643
so I'm just gonna stick with that.

68
00:03:23,663 --> 00:03:25,945
You know, if you're looking in graphical form,

69
00:03:26,225 --> 00:03:27,486
again, gaining your 10 or $20 makes you happy,

70
00:03:27,506 --> 00:03:29,647
and losing the $10 makes you unhappy, but in a.

71
00:03:34,354 --> 00:03:35,895
arbitrary scale more unhappy.

72
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:45,242
Studies have shown, and we're going to get a little bit into the details of how we know

73
00:03:45,302 --> 00:03:46,303
these numbers, but

74
00:03:46,663 --> 00:03:50,846
studies have shown that losses are about two times as intense as gains.

75
00:03:52,027 --> 00:03:54,649
The first research on this was done by Kahneman and Tversky

76
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:56,230
back in the eighties.

77
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:01,573
They were two Israeli psychologists, and they did a lot of really, really interesting work

78
00:04:01,773 --> 00:04:06,496
about how people are really not acting rationally and act irrationally.

79
00:04:07,137 --> 00:04:13,041
And they were approaching things in terms of what they called, in economics, there was

80
00:04:13,081 --> 00:04:17,324
a principle called homo economicus, which is that all of the studies of economics was

81
00:04:17,364 --> 00:04:21,787
based around the idea that people acted absolutely rationally and perfectly in their own interests.

82
00:04:22,747 --> 00:04:24,749
And they found a lot of ways that people do not.

83
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:26,230
And this is one of the biggies.

84
00:04:27,363 --> 00:04:30,365
Ultimately, they did win the Nobel Prize for this work.

85
00:04:30,785 --> 00:04:33,027
Actually, Kahneman was awarded the Nobel Prize.

86
00:04:33,047 --> 00:04:34,948
Tversky had passed away a couple years

87
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:35,989
before they were awarded it.

88
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:40,433
And as far as I know, he is the only non-economist

89
00:04:40,593 --> 00:04:44,916
to win the Nobel Prize in economics for this work.

90
00:04:47,898 --> 00:04:49,660
So the purpose of this talk,

91
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,181
and what I'm hoping that you're gonna bring out of it,

92
00:04:51,321 --> 00:04:53,483
is that when I,

93
00:04:53,882 --> 00:04:57,025
teach my game design students one of the questions that we

94
00:04:57,045 --> 00:04:59,367
always talk about early is to start with a mechanic or do you

95
00:04:59,407 --> 00:05:02,649
start with a theme or you know how do you want to start and I

96
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:05,091
always recommend that they start with an experience that they

97
00:05:05,111 --> 00:05:07,493
want to give the players or they start with an emotion that they

98
00:05:07,533 --> 00:05:10,956
want to give the players and for those of you that were here

99
00:05:10,996 --> 00:05:15,800
for the talk prior to mine about pandemic legacy, you know,

100
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,981
learned a lot about the the beats and the emotional roller

101
00:05:18,021 --> 00:05:20,263
coaster that was specifically kind of pre-programmed for the

102
00:05:20,303 --> 00:05:22,845
players and the way that they interacted with that and

103
00:05:24,159 --> 00:05:25,940
As a game designer, as game developers,

104
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,780
we want to manipulate the player's emotions.

105
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,861
So some of these are tools about things

106
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:33,161
that are gonna make the players upset,

107
00:05:33,301 --> 00:05:34,642
things that are gonna make the players happy.

108
00:05:34,942 --> 00:05:36,902
You don't wanna necessarily avoid loss aversion.

109
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:39,343
Sometimes you can use it in a very effective way

110
00:05:39,623 --> 00:05:40,903
to manipulate the players.

111
00:05:41,504 --> 00:05:44,004
Again, going back to pandemic legacy or risk legacy,

112
00:05:44,124 --> 00:05:45,345
when that game first came out,

113
00:05:46,405 --> 00:05:48,245
one of the very first things that it made you do

114
00:05:48,665 --> 00:05:49,906
was tear up a card.

115
00:05:49,926 --> 00:05:53,227
It was a sticker or it was a card, right?

116
00:05:54,494 --> 00:05:55,975
Card, yes, you had to tear up a card.

117
00:05:56,275 --> 00:05:58,157
And that's a very emotional thing for players,

118
00:05:58,457 --> 00:06:00,598
not both because it kind of goes against

119
00:06:00,638 --> 00:06:02,219
a social taboo of destroying the game,

120
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,901
but because it's tapping into that idea of loss.

121
00:06:04,941 --> 00:06:06,082
This is something that I bought,

122
00:06:06,382 --> 00:06:07,423
this is something that I own,

123
00:06:07,763 --> 00:06:09,884
and the first thing that the game is asking me to do

124
00:06:10,325 --> 00:06:11,525
is take a piece of it and rip it up.

125
00:06:12,962 --> 00:06:15,183
So the idea is that by leveraging to this,

126
00:06:15,263 --> 00:06:16,884
you can get the players to the point

127
00:06:16,904 --> 00:06:17,824
that you want them to get at.

128
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:20,045
In that case, by having them tear something up,

129
00:06:20,445 --> 00:06:23,147
it was telling them that you're invested in this

130
00:06:23,247 --> 00:06:25,308
and it's gonna be an emotional experience.

131
00:06:27,769 --> 00:06:29,190
Okay, this one is an all play.

132
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,430
It's this game.

133
00:06:30,831 --> 00:06:35,053
By the way, in these games, in these little demonstrations,

134
00:06:35,973 --> 00:06:38,474
it will go a lot smoother if you don't try to outthink.

135
00:06:39,667 --> 00:06:43,430
What's being asked just look inside yourself and go with your first reaction

136
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:46,492
and think about what you would answer if you were at what your feelings are

137
00:06:46,912 --> 00:06:49,033
because that's the way your players are going to react. They're not going to

138
00:06:49,074 --> 00:06:52,636
necessarily see that there that it's manipulative or that is being framed in

139
00:06:52,656 --> 00:06:55,358
a particular way. So just just kind of go with that.

140
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:59,400
So here's 2 choices that you've got choice a

141
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:02,062
I will give you $3,000 and in choice B.

142
00:07:05,214 --> 00:07:06,875
you have an 80% chance to win $4,000

143
00:07:07,315 --> 00:07:09,857
or a 20% chance to get nothing.

144
00:07:11,538 --> 00:07:13,939
And the question is, would you take choice A or choice B?

145
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:14,759
And just as a little hint,

146
00:07:15,179 --> 00:07:18,301
I'll tell you that the average winnings on choice B

147
00:07:18,481 --> 00:07:21,423
is $3,200, just to take the math out of it.

148
00:07:22,564 --> 00:07:24,064
So how many of you would take choice A?

149
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:27,106
And how many would take B?

150
00:07:28,667 --> 00:07:28,947
Okay.

151
00:07:30,228 --> 00:07:30,928
Almost all of you.

152
00:07:31,348 --> 00:07:33,189
In actuality, when people are surveyed on this,

153
00:07:33,249 --> 00:07:34,970
about 80% will choose choice A.

154
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,060
And now from an economic standpoint,

155
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,761
going back to our homo economicus,

156
00:07:41,121 --> 00:07:43,461
choice B is better overall for you to do.

157
00:07:45,442 --> 00:07:46,362
Yet people choose A.

158
00:07:46,462 --> 00:07:47,702
We'll talk a little bit about the reasons

159
00:07:48,122 --> 00:07:48,902
into that in a second.

160
00:07:49,383 --> 00:07:52,503
But let's jump to two other choices now.

161
00:07:53,524 --> 00:07:55,964
Choice A, you're guaranteed to lose $3,000.

162
00:07:56,444 --> 00:08:00,205
And in choice B, you have an 80% chance of losing $4,000,

163
00:08:00,285 --> 00:08:01,245
but a 20% chance of losing nothing.

164
00:08:05,795 --> 00:08:07,717
So in this case, how many people would choose choice A?

165
00:08:10,638 --> 00:08:11,799
And how many would choose choice B?

166
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:13,540
Okay.

167
00:08:14,581 --> 00:08:16,582
We have a very average crowd here, this is good.

168
00:08:17,603 --> 00:08:20,064
So 72% of people surveyed on this will choose B.

169
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:24,267
And again, those of you that chose A in the first one

170
00:08:24,307 --> 00:08:26,928
and B in the second one, you have made choices

171
00:08:26,988 --> 00:08:29,170
that are against your economic interests in both cases.

172
00:08:30,891 --> 00:08:32,532
But most people will go with that.

173
00:08:33,653 --> 00:08:34,813
The general rule is,

174
00:08:35,701 --> 00:08:38,644
that people will take a sure gain over a gamble,

175
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:41,506
but people will gamble to avoid a loss.

176
00:08:43,087 --> 00:08:44,889
That's a really, really important concept.

177
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,851
And I'm sure you're already thinking

178
00:08:47,891 --> 00:08:50,594
about some of the game play implications of the way

179
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:51,134
that that works.

180
00:08:56,098 --> 00:08:59,321
So to kind of just look into a little bit of a game example,

181
00:09:00,202 --> 00:09:02,404
I know this is a board game talk, and this is.

182
00:09:03,031 --> 00:09:06,052
a card from hearthstone which is not a board game, but I'm counting it as a board game.

183
00:09:06,692 --> 00:09:09,773
Counting is a card game that can do some fancy things that regular card games can't do.

184
00:09:10,514 --> 00:09:14,315
This is a card from the hunter class called tracking.

185
00:09:16,536 --> 00:09:20,797
And the text on the card, in case it's not clear, says, look at the top three cards of

186
00:09:20,818 --> 00:09:23,539
your deck, draw one and discard the others.

187
00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:28,520
So you basically see, you draw the top three cards of your deck, you see one of them and

188
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,121
the other two are gone from the game forever.

189
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:34,272
And this card, if you go onto HearthPwn

190
00:09:34,292 --> 00:09:37,215
or you go onto sites that talk about Hearthstone,

191
00:09:37,575 --> 00:09:40,418
this card is not usually well-received,

192
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:41,599
especially by new players.

193
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:46,202
I pulled some comments out about tracking.

194
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:48,284
I see the use of tracking, but psychologically,

195
00:09:48,304 --> 00:09:50,346
I've always disliked the idea of burning two cards

196
00:09:50,386 --> 00:09:50,986
to get a third.

197
00:09:51,006 --> 00:09:53,228
If I put a card in my deck, it means I wanna use it,

198
00:09:53,889 --> 00:09:55,570
not to discard it in favor of something else.

199
00:09:56,491 --> 00:09:57,632
Or the bottom one, tracking.

200
00:09:57,712 --> 00:09:59,053
Burn two other cards to draw one

201
00:09:59,093 --> 00:10:00,775
and possibly lose key parts of your deck.

202
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,521
This is tapping into that idea of,

203
00:10:05,581 --> 00:10:07,261
it's giving anxiety to players.

204
00:10:07,341 --> 00:10:09,462
They're worrying about, okay, I'm gonna draw three cards,

205
00:10:09,862 --> 00:10:10,462
and that's a problem.

206
00:10:11,042 --> 00:10:12,402
But the reality is,

207
00:10:13,342 --> 00:10:15,103
from a particularly mathematical standpoint,

208
00:10:15,243 --> 00:10:17,763
is that it really, discarding two cards from your deck

209
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:19,504
only becomes an issue if you get all the way

210
00:10:19,544 --> 00:10:20,264
to the end of your deck.

211
00:10:21,104 --> 00:10:22,984
The way Hearthstone works, you have 30 cards.

212
00:10:23,505 --> 00:10:25,025
At the end of the 30 cards,

213
00:10:25,085 --> 00:10:26,085
if you have to draw some more cards,

214
00:10:26,105 --> 00:10:27,165
you start taking damage.

215
00:10:27,245 --> 00:10:28,686
So yeah, I mean, discarding cards

216
00:10:28,726 --> 00:10:29,786
can be a little bit of a problem.

217
00:10:30,437 --> 00:10:32,038
But for those of you who have played Hearthstone,

218
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:34,018
if you're a hunter and you've reached the end of your deck,

219
00:10:34,118 --> 00:10:35,619
you're probably in trouble anyway.

220
00:10:36,439 --> 00:10:39,280
So mostly, it doesn't really factor into the game.

221
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,101
But psychologically, people are seeing those cards

222
00:10:42,161 --> 00:10:43,541
and seeing those goods cards and knowing,

223
00:10:43,661 --> 00:10:44,781
I'm never gonna get to play them again.

224
00:10:47,002 --> 00:10:48,382
Here's an alternative reworking

225
00:10:48,542 --> 00:10:50,783
that I've run by other people.

226
00:10:51,663 --> 00:10:54,404
And most people are happier with this phrase,

227
00:10:54,544 --> 00:10:56,405
with this wording of the tracking effect.

228
00:10:57,045 --> 00:10:58,325
Look at the top three cards of your deck.

229
00:10:59,094 --> 00:11:01,617
keep one and shuffle the other two back into your deck,

230
00:11:02,478 --> 00:11:04,900
then discard the bottom two cards in your deck

231
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,701
without looking at them.

232
00:11:07,763 --> 00:11:09,044
Now it's basically the same effect.

233
00:11:09,605 --> 00:11:11,447
You get one card of your choice

234
00:11:12,308 --> 00:11:14,550
and two other cards are gone from your deck.

235
00:11:15,131 --> 00:11:17,153
But because they're at the bottom of your deck,

236
00:11:17,233 --> 00:11:18,514
most people feel psychologically,

237
00:11:18,534 --> 00:11:20,176
well, they're at the bottom of my deck.

238
00:11:20,216 --> 00:11:21,838
I was never gonna see those cards anyway.

239
00:11:23,587 --> 00:11:25,908
The reality is that this is actually a worse effect for you

240
00:11:26,028 --> 00:11:27,309
than the real tracking effect,

241
00:11:27,389 --> 00:11:28,870
because in the actual tracking effect,

242
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:30,830
you know two of the cards that are never gonna come up,

243
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,591
and so if you're planning your tactics or whatever,

244
00:11:33,572 --> 00:11:35,652
you know that you're never gonna draw that,

245
00:11:35,733 --> 00:11:36,953
and so you can work around that.

246
00:11:37,153 --> 00:11:38,594
In this, you don't know what you've lost,

247
00:11:39,194 --> 00:11:42,375
but people psychologically are happier with this effect.

248
00:11:47,318 --> 00:11:50,379
Here's another case study that comes into loss aversion.

249
00:11:50,979 --> 00:11:53,380
Level draining in RPGs.

250
00:11:55,048 --> 00:12:00,517
I gave this presentation to my class about a month, a couple of weeks ago, and when I

251
00:12:00,557 --> 00:12:04,363
put the level draining slide up, there was an audible moan that went through the class.

252
00:12:07,848 --> 00:12:09,671
Again, these are some quotes from.

253
00:12:11,488 --> 00:12:14,490
from some DND forums about draining levels.

254
00:12:15,211 --> 00:12:17,392
And you can read that, but I've highlighted

255
00:12:17,432 --> 00:12:18,433
some of the other stuff in there.

256
00:12:18,854 --> 00:12:21,816
On the bottom, there is little you can do in DND

257
00:12:21,836 --> 00:12:23,577
to viscerally terrify players,

258
00:12:23,637 --> 00:12:25,718
but for whatever reason, level draining does it.

259
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,440
And a couple of more quotes.

260
00:12:29,861 --> 00:12:31,182
This is all from the same thread.

261
00:12:31,442 --> 00:12:33,424
All versions of DND have some form of raised dead,

262
00:12:33,484 --> 00:12:34,725
not all versions have restoration.

263
00:12:34,785 --> 00:12:36,946
Many players would rather die than lose 50% of their XP.

264
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:41,472
which I have verified with my daughter, she agreed with that.

265
00:12:42,152 --> 00:12:44,834
Maybe this is a more emotional than sensible reaction,

266
00:12:44,874 --> 00:12:46,015
but many players feel that way.

267
00:12:46,035 --> 00:12:47,736
And my favorite quote of the whole thing on the bottom

268
00:12:47,756 --> 00:12:49,898
there, but what I've always liked about level drain

269
00:12:49,938 --> 00:12:51,679
is just how personal that loss can be,

270
00:12:51,819 --> 00:12:53,340
as if part of the character's life

271
00:12:53,781 --> 00:12:56,443
truly was just ripped away forever, lessening them for it.

272
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:01,826
That's a real visceral emotional response to losing something.

273
00:13:02,067 --> 00:13:03,688
And people don't even really, like I said,

274
00:13:03,748 --> 00:13:06,170
have that effect a lot of times if their characters die.

275
00:13:07,837 --> 00:13:10,037
It's the ending of a story, it's in some service,

276
00:13:10,097 --> 00:13:13,258
but level draining has a different aspect to it.

277
00:13:14,098 --> 00:13:16,099
And interestingly, if you look at D&D

278
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:17,879
and what they've done over the years with level draining,

279
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,260
in Advanced Dungeons and Dragons,

280
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,880
which is the first version I got into,

281
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,721
level draining was there, it was an undead ability,

282
00:13:23,741 --> 00:13:25,402
and there was no save against level draining.

283
00:13:25,822 --> 00:13:27,642
You got hit by a white or a lich or something,

284
00:13:28,122 --> 00:13:28,643
you were screwed.

285
00:13:30,183 --> 00:13:31,183
In the third edition,

286
00:13:32,224 --> 00:13:33,644
there was a saving roll that was allowed.

287
00:13:34,935 --> 00:13:37,637
at least, but if it failed, you lost the level.

288
00:13:37,997 --> 00:13:39,579
Then in fourth edition, they completely

289
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:40,500
got rid of level draining.

290
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,742
And if you go to Pathfinder, which

291
00:13:43,803 --> 00:13:45,904
is kind of like sort of an offshoot of third edition,

292
00:13:47,005 --> 00:13:50,088
they didn't make that many changes from third edition D&D,

293
00:13:50,108 --> 00:13:51,369
but one of the ones that they did was they

294
00:13:51,409 --> 00:13:52,250
got rid of level draining.

295
00:13:53,391 --> 00:13:54,912
So it's obviously that over the years

296
00:13:54,952 --> 00:13:57,074
that this was recognized as something that was not

297
00:13:57,134 --> 00:13:58,495
something that players wanted that

298
00:13:58,535 --> 00:14:01,198
put them into an emotional state that they found uncomfortable.

299
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:08,748
So giving something to a player and then taking it away

300
00:14:10,229 --> 00:14:11,009
is really emotional.

301
00:14:11,409 --> 00:14:13,531
And that goes back to that idea of,

302
00:14:15,472 --> 00:14:18,794
from Risk Legacy, of forcing the players

303
00:14:18,834 --> 00:14:20,555
to tear up a card in the very beginning.

304
00:14:21,075 --> 00:14:24,297
Better not to have given them that card in the first place,

305
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:25,878
or just have them randomly draw one

306
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:27,039
and leave the other one in the box.

307
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:28,800
You know, it has the same effect

308
00:14:29,901 --> 00:14:31,202
from a mechanical standpoint,

309
00:14:31,422 --> 00:14:32,623
but it does not have the same effect

310
00:14:32,643 --> 00:14:33,763
from an emotional standpoint.

311
00:14:38,369 --> 00:14:42,431
I'd like to take a quick detour into a game show

312
00:14:42,491 --> 00:14:44,872
that my family, including my in-laws,

313
00:14:44,912 --> 00:14:46,072
will no longer watch with me.

314
00:14:48,093 --> 00:14:48,933
Deal or no deal?

315
00:14:50,394 --> 00:14:52,315
I'm assuming most of you are familiar with the show.

316
00:14:52,395 --> 00:14:53,575
But for those of you that are not,

317
00:14:54,756 --> 00:14:59,258
there's a bunch of suitcases that all have varying values

318
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:01,658
of money in them, ranging from $1 to $1 million.

319
00:15:01,699 --> 00:15:04,039
You pick one case at random that you're going to keep.

320
00:15:04,119 --> 00:15:05,700
And then you gradually open the cases,

321
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,621
showing the money so you know what you didn't get.

322
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:10,079
and then at various points in the game,

323
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,180
there's a banker that comes on, very shadowy figure,

324
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,441
and he offers you money for your case.

325
00:15:16,581 --> 00:15:20,562
Now, from a purely mathematical standpoint,

326
00:15:21,622 --> 00:15:23,862
there's, you know, you know the expectation value

327
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:25,343
of that case, you know the average value

328
00:15:25,363 --> 00:15:26,403
of all the cases that are left,

329
00:15:26,763 --> 00:15:29,124
and the expectation value that remains is, you know,

330
00:15:29,164 --> 00:15:31,724
the average of that is what you should get for it.

331
00:15:31,784 --> 00:15:33,845
If it's less than that, you're leaving money on the table.

332
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:39,903
But the reality is in the show is that the banker always offers less than the expectation value.

333
00:15:40,003 --> 00:15:45,166
It's actually really interesting if you track the show is the first round they offer way, way less than the expectation value

334
00:15:45,566 --> 00:15:46,666
and they gradually approach it.

335
00:15:47,387 --> 00:15:50,268
It's just they don't want people walking away in the beginning of the game.

336
00:15:51,489 --> 00:15:56,771
But why does anybody take the offer if they're leaving that money on the table?

337
00:15:58,212 --> 00:16:02,594
And this goes back to the first one of the first examples that we did, which is

338
00:16:04,107 --> 00:16:06,788
captured in a psychological theory called utility theory.

339
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:11,209
And that goes to the idea that if I'm offering you

340
00:16:11,229 --> 00:16:13,150
a million dollars or two million dollars,

341
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:16,792
as far as you're concerned, it's probably not gonna,

342
00:16:17,052 --> 00:16:19,012
getting the two million dollars is not gonna change your life

343
00:16:19,373 --> 00:16:21,974
as much as getting that first million dollars is gonna be.

344
00:16:22,494 --> 00:16:24,915
So in your mind, they're about the same amount of money.

345
00:16:26,925 --> 00:16:29,207
And that's really what Deal or No Deal is playing on,

346
00:16:29,247 --> 00:16:30,868
is it's playing on people's, okay,

347
00:16:31,368 --> 00:16:33,110
this, you know, the guy's offering me $120,000,

348
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:36,132
but it could be a million dollars.

349
00:16:37,033 --> 00:16:38,153
So for me personally,

350
00:16:38,294 --> 00:16:40,175
where is that falling on my utility spectrum?

351
00:16:40,655 --> 00:16:41,916
And that's what's interesting to watch.

352
00:16:41,976 --> 00:16:43,618
It's interesting to watch people struggle

353
00:16:43,658 --> 00:16:47,240
with that idea of, you know, it's not just the number,

354
00:16:47,321 --> 00:16:48,802
it's not just going for the biggest number,

355
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:50,323
but it's the utility

356
00:16:50,363 --> 00:16:51,664
and how that's gonna apply to your life.

357
00:16:52,751 --> 00:16:55,471
Now if we go back to that first example that I gave you guys

358
00:16:55,792 --> 00:16:56,452
about the chance to get $3,000

359
00:16:56,912 --> 00:16:58,452
and the 80% chance to get $4,000,

360
00:16:58,752 --> 00:17:03,773
our brains are not great at math for the most part.

361
00:17:04,713 --> 00:17:06,054
Most people see $3,000 and $4,000

362
00:17:06,794 --> 00:17:09,154
and put them in the same box in their brain.

363
00:17:10,394 --> 00:17:15,055
So really, for most people from a utility theory standpoint,

364
00:17:15,255 --> 00:17:18,476
this problem is really, I'm guaranteed to get X

365
00:17:18,816 --> 00:17:19,736
or I have an 80% chance to get X.

366
00:17:21,229 --> 00:17:23,050
And in that case, I'm always gonna take

367
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:24,352
the one that's guaranteed to get X.

368
00:17:24,392 --> 00:17:26,995
The fact that it's $3,200 doesn't really apply

369
00:17:27,655 --> 00:17:29,237
that the expectation value is higher.

370
00:17:31,699 --> 00:17:35,684
So that's just another way of looking at these things,

371
00:17:35,704 --> 00:17:39,888
and we'll talk in a bit about bigger numbers as well.

372
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:42,991
Okay.

373
00:17:46,703 --> 00:17:49,804
This example is, for those of you that are here,

374
00:17:49,864 --> 00:17:51,505
again, for the pandemic legacy talk.

375
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:55,126
This is actually, it was a real study that was done

376
00:17:55,246 --> 00:17:57,226
that I did not choose because I did not know

377
00:17:57,246 --> 00:17:59,667
that I was gonna be directly after the pandemic legacy talk.

378
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,167
But this is the problem.

379
00:18:01,627 --> 00:18:03,208
A deadly disease is rapidly spreading.

380
00:18:04,288 --> 00:18:06,228
If nothing is done, then 600 people will die.

381
00:18:09,249 --> 00:18:11,830
So a cure has been developed.

382
00:18:13,713 --> 00:18:16,074
But you have two choices of which cure you're going to do.

383
00:18:16,114 --> 00:18:19,777
You can either do choice A, remember 600 people

384
00:18:20,618 --> 00:18:21,758
will die if nothing is done.

385
00:18:21,938 --> 00:18:23,920
So choice A is that 200 people will be saved.

386
00:18:25,161 --> 00:18:29,744
And choice B is a 1 3rd chance that all 600 will be saved

387
00:18:29,804 --> 00:18:32,165
and a 2 3rd chance that nobody will be saved.

388
00:18:33,866 --> 00:18:35,487
So how many people here would do choice A?

389
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:38,549
And how many would do B?

390
00:18:40,431 --> 00:18:40,671
Okay.

391
00:18:42,537 --> 00:18:45,958
When surveyed, about three quarters of people will do A.

392
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:46,938
200 people will be saved.

393
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:50,919
Let's do another problem.

394
00:18:51,659 --> 00:18:52,379
Same situation.

395
00:18:52,579 --> 00:18:53,960
Deadly disease is rapidly spreading.

396
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,640
If nothing is done, 600 people will die.

397
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:00,702
In this case, you could take choice C,

398
00:19:01,162 --> 00:19:01,782
400 people will die.

399
00:19:04,003 --> 00:19:05,123
Or if you pick cure D,

400
00:19:05,483 --> 00:19:07,223
then there's a one-third chance that nobody dies,

401
00:19:07,524 --> 00:19:09,384
but a two-thirds chance that 600 people die.

402
00:19:10,644 --> 00:19:11,205
So who will take C?

403
00:19:13,657 --> 00:19:14,418
A lot fewer people.

404
00:19:14,718 --> 00:19:15,398
And who would take D?

405
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:17,799
Okay.

406
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,822
So, in this case 78% choose D.

407
00:19:23,422 --> 00:19:24,583
So most people are with you guys.

408
00:19:26,744 --> 00:19:28,525
So these are the four choices put together here.

409
00:19:29,405 --> 00:19:31,386
So, choice A, B, C, and D.

410
00:19:34,127 --> 00:19:35,668
Now since 600 people are gonna die,

411
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:38,289
choice A and choice C, 200 people will be saved

412
00:19:38,309 --> 00:19:40,170
and 400 people will die, are exactly the same.

413
00:19:41,271 --> 00:19:44,314
And choice B and choice D are also exactly the same.

414
00:19:45,735 --> 00:19:49,338
So did anybody here pick A for the first one

415
00:19:49,378 --> 00:19:50,219
and D for the second one?

416
00:19:52,601 --> 00:19:53,302
That's very common.

417
00:19:54,042 --> 00:19:54,843
A lot of people do that.

418
00:19:56,304 --> 00:19:58,606
And this leads to a concept that's called framing.

419
00:19:59,627 --> 00:20:00,948
What is a gain or what is a loss?

420
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:04,972
And this is another great manipulation tool

421
00:20:05,032 --> 00:20:06,073
for player psychology.

422
00:20:10,093 --> 00:20:12,075
If you say 200 people will be saved,

423
00:20:12,255 --> 00:20:15,416
that's a positive emotion.

424
00:20:15,857 --> 00:20:18,158
People like that, 200 people will be saved.

425
00:20:18,298 --> 00:20:19,619
And the other one is all probabilities.

426
00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:22,260
The other one is 400 people will die.

427
00:20:23,701 --> 00:20:25,842
So again, we're going back to that idea

428
00:20:25,882 --> 00:20:28,324
that people will take a gain,

429
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:31,065
a sure gain over gambling to gain more.

430
00:20:31,645 --> 00:20:34,707
But people will gamble to avoid a sure loss.

431
00:20:35,198 --> 00:20:36,639
And that's exactly what's happening here.

432
00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:41,000
Except in this case, the outcomes are exactly the same.

433
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,301
It's not, you know, losing money versus gaining money.

434
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:45,862
But if you express it as saving people

435
00:20:46,003 --> 00:20:47,443
or express it as people dying,

436
00:20:47,863 --> 00:20:49,104
then people will approach it differently

437
00:20:49,144 --> 00:20:51,965
and will have a different response to it.

438
00:20:54,906 --> 00:20:56,667
So in a board game context,

439
00:20:59,428 --> 00:21:00,789
this can be used a lot of different ways.

440
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:06,009
One of my new games which is coming out in the spring is called pick crew and

441
00:21:06,189 --> 00:21:11,512
it's about the players. It's a team based game where each team is trying to

442
00:21:11,953 --> 00:21:14,954
repair their race car and get it back out onto the track as quickly as possible

443
00:21:15,355 --> 00:21:19,337
against the other teams. If you make mistakes, it's a real time game. You're

444
00:21:19,357 --> 00:21:23,139
trying to do things as fast as possible. If you make mistakes, you get penalty

445
00:21:23,179 --> 00:21:23,379
points.

446
00:21:25,925 --> 00:21:27,686
And we looked at a couple different ways to do this.

447
00:21:27,746 --> 00:21:30,226
Originally, the way that we did it is you got points

448
00:21:30,766 --> 00:21:33,127
for doing good things, and if you got penalty points,

449
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:33,807
you lost points.

450
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:39,508
And we found that when this is aimed at families,

451
00:21:39,848 --> 00:21:43,248
and in a family game is, if you had a lot of kids playing

452
00:21:43,288 --> 00:21:45,469
and stuff like that, they didn't like losing the points

453
00:21:45,909 --> 00:21:47,149
if they made mistakes on the car.

454
00:21:47,189 --> 00:21:49,529
There's also a strategy to intentionally make mistakes

455
00:21:49,569 --> 00:21:51,450
to get back, you know, get your car out faster

456
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:53,810
because the first team that's out can get a bonus

457
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:54,730
and can earn extra things.

458
00:21:55,653 --> 00:21:57,913
So what we did instead, when we kind of saw that,

459
00:21:58,013 --> 00:21:59,374
is we flipped it around and we said,

460
00:21:59,434 --> 00:22:03,155
okay, if you get a penalty, you don't lose points,

461
00:22:03,195 --> 00:22:04,655
but all the other teams gain points.

462
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:09,076
And it was easy because it was a score track

463
00:22:09,116 --> 00:22:11,157
and people just could move their tokens up on the track.

464
00:22:11,657 --> 00:22:12,877
And that worked really, really well.

465
00:22:13,077 --> 00:22:14,018
People enjoyed that.

466
00:22:16,078 --> 00:22:17,999
It opened it up, it took away the negative feelings.

467
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,399
Okay, penalty points, I'm on there, it's fine.

468
00:22:20,899 --> 00:22:23,060
It also fortuitously enabled us

469
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,720
to make the score track look like a racetrack.

470
00:22:25,411 --> 00:22:27,072
So you have a little car running around the racetrack.

471
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:30,373
And just metaphorically, race cars don't usually go backwards.

472
00:22:31,413 --> 00:22:32,734
So you push the other cars forward.

473
00:22:33,114 --> 00:22:35,355
But it really just changed the whole dynamic of the game

474
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:37,075
and the way that people approach the penalty points,

475
00:22:37,135 --> 00:22:40,257
that it helped your opponents instead of hurting you.

476
00:22:41,937 --> 00:22:45,038
I mentioned the Expanse game that's coming out.

477
00:22:45,518 --> 00:22:47,599
In that, there is a mechanic where you

478
00:22:49,424 --> 00:22:50,404
can keep an event.

479
00:22:51,285 --> 00:22:53,225
There's event cards, and you can save one for later.

480
00:22:53,245 --> 00:22:54,586
But if you choose to save one for later,

481
00:22:54,726 --> 00:22:55,806
it costs you a victory point.

482
00:22:56,226 --> 00:22:57,467
Or there's other things you can do in the game

483
00:22:57,487 --> 00:22:58,407
that cost you victory points.

484
00:22:59,307 --> 00:23:01,728
And I considered applying the same kind of idea

485
00:23:01,768 --> 00:23:03,408
that instead of costing you victory points,

486
00:23:03,468 --> 00:23:05,129
it could give bonuses to all the other players.

487
00:23:05,169 --> 00:23:06,749
But in that case, emotionally,

488
00:23:06,809 --> 00:23:08,410
I wanted the players to feel invested

489
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:10,350
that they were really committing something

490
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:13,271
into getting this event and saving it.

491
00:23:13,871 --> 00:23:15,352
So in that case, we chose to

492
00:23:16,473 --> 00:23:20,795
have it apply as a specific penalty to players where you actually have to give up victory

493
00:23:20,855 --> 00:23:22,755
points in order to do this action.

494
00:23:26,456 --> 00:23:30,317
In general, we have seen a shifting away from losses and players losing things over the

495
00:23:30,337 --> 00:23:30,497
years.

496
00:23:30,537 --> 00:23:35,178
I mean, the old school games, you know, from the, that we all grew up with, Monopoly and

497
00:23:35,259 --> 00:23:40,560
Risk, are very much about loss, but they're very much about a specific type of loss where

498
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,780
you gain and then you lose.

499
00:23:42,553 --> 00:23:45,294
Okay, so in monopoly you start with no properties

500
00:23:46,035 --> 00:23:49,456
and money, you get properties and you get hopefully a little more money and then

501
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:52,318
for everybody except for the winner you lose everything.

502
00:23:52,858 --> 00:23:57,360
Same thing for risk. Risk, you start with territories and you'll take more

503
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,841
territories, you build up an empire and then it's taken away.

504
00:24:01,067 --> 00:24:05,211
and that classically will give you all of those negative feelings about losing stuff.

505
00:24:05,471 --> 00:24:09,456
Whereas the newer games and what the Euro games really brought to the table in the 90s

506
00:24:09,976 --> 00:24:12,258
was this idea of constantly building.

507
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:13,680
In the Settlers of Catan,

508
00:24:14,601 --> 00:24:17,444
everybody starts with more than what they ended up with.

509
00:24:17,884 --> 00:24:20,687
Nobody is losing stuff. Once you build a city, you get it.

510
00:24:21,348 --> 00:24:24,071
Even the bonuses that you get, the largest army...

511
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:26,219
If you get the largest army card,

512
00:24:26,459 --> 00:24:28,380
you don't lose it because your army is defeated

513
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,280
and you shrink, you lose it because people

514
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,540
got bigger armies than you.

515
00:24:31,641 --> 00:24:32,821
Same thing with the longest road.

516
00:24:33,581 --> 00:24:36,262
If you have a long road, well, people can cut off your road

517
00:24:36,282 --> 00:24:37,402
if they build a settlement in the middle,

518
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:38,463
but that's kind of an edge case.

519
00:24:38,603 --> 00:24:40,743
But for the most part, if you got the longest road,

520
00:24:41,123 --> 00:24:42,604
people are only going to take it away from you

521
00:24:42,624 --> 00:24:43,824
by building an even longer road.

522
00:24:47,545 --> 00:24:50,046
Okay, so given loss aversion,

523
00:24:50,126 --> 00:24:51,386
why do people play in casinos?

524
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:55,131
Ultimately, they have to overcome this in a big way.

525
00:24:55,271 --> 00:24:59,093
I mean, the $20 bet that I made with Rob in the beginning

526
00:24:59,233 --> 00:25:02,975
was basically a roulette spin, was basically blackjack.

527
00:25:03,815 --> 00:25:04,956
And there's a couple of different techniques

528
00:25:04,996 --> 00:25:05,496
that they use.

529
00:25:05,556 --> 00:25:06,417
The first is chips.

530
00:25:08,818 --> 00:25:10,399
First thing you have to do when you walk into a casino

531
00:25:10,419 --> 00:25:12,880
is you have to exchange your money for an abstract token.

532
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,541
And a lot of studies have shown

533
00:25:15,001 --> 00:25:16,862
that when people start exchanging tokens

534
00:25:16,902 --> 00:25:17,982
instead of exchanging money,

535
00:25:18,403 --> 00:25:20,224
that they don't ascribe the same value to it.

536
00:25:20,404 --> 00:25:22,185
It gets abstracted and.

537
00:25:22,975 --> 00:25:27,138
they get subtracted and they don't assign as much value to it.

538
00:25:27,738 --> 00:25:32,602
And casinos specifically will try to make it difficult for you to convert.

539
00:25:32,702 --> 00:25:34,103
It's easy for one-way trip,

540
00:25:34,123 --> 00:25:36,644
but you can't go back the other way also once you convert to chips.

541
00:25:37,825 --> 00:25:38,986
If you sit down at a blackjack table,

542
00:25:39,006 --> 00:25:41,408
I can give $200 to a blackjack dealer and they'll hand me a stack of chips,

543
00:25:41,448 --> 00:25:42,909
but if I want to turn my chips back into money,

544
00:25:42,929 --> 00:25:44,110
I can't do it right there.

545
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,651
I got to pick up and I got to walk across.

546
00:25:47,732 --> 00:25:49,553
But the other big thing is also jackpots.

547
00:25:50,341 --> 00:25:52,922
People are really bad at dealing with big numbers

548
00:25:53,423 --> 00:25:54,603
and small probabilities,

549
00:25:55,444 --> 00:25:57,825
and the casinos are starting to take advantage of that.

550
00:25:58,605 --> 00:25:59,766
Most of the games now, if you go,

551
00:25:59,806 --> 00:26:00,886
if you've been to casinos lately,

552
00:26:00,946 --> 00:26:02,687
blackjack tables and a lot of these new games,

553
00:26:02,747 --> 00:26:05,129
they all have these little jackpot bonus bets.

554
00:26:05,489 --> 00:26:06,229
It's very common.

555
00:26:06,269 --> 00:26:07,170
People like that.

556
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:09,471
People like the idea that they're gonna get a lot of money,

557
00:26:09,871 --> 00:26:12,993
and that helps them overcome this idea of loss aversion.

558
00:26:14,363 --> 00:26:16,084
Basically, the lottery as an example,

559
00:26:16,844 --> 00:26:18,165
to put it into the same frame

560
00:26:18,185 --> 00:26:19,485
that we've been using on these other things,

561
00:26:19,685 --> 00:26:22,667
is that choice A is, I'm guaranteed to lose nothing.

562
00:26:23,187 --> 00:26:27,349
Choice B is, I've got a 99.9999999% chance to lose a dollar

563
00:26:27,889 --> 00:26:29,250
or a really, really tiny chance

564
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,630
to gain a half a million dollars.

565
00:26:32,331 --> 00:26:34,792
And again, the expectation value choice B here is negative.

566
00:26:35,313 --> 00:26:36,973
But this is a bet that people make all the time.

567
00:26:37,494 --> 00:26:39,895
Whereas that $20 bet, people won't make it.

568
00:26:39,915 --> 00:26:40,975
So,

569
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,682
What's going on here is that people are really bad

570
00:26:46,902 --> 00:26:47,943
at that number, that .0000001%,

571
00:26:49,704 --> 00:26:54,668
and the lotteries are all taking advantage of that.

572
00:26:54,748 --> 00:26:58,210
Powerball used to be about 100 million to one odds to win,

573
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:01,773
and they keep changing the game every couple of years,

574
00:27:02,173 --> 00:27:05,575
and now it's like 300 million to one to win.

575
00:27:07,368 --> 00:27:09,209
because they like these big jackpots.

576
00:27:09,389 --> 00:27:12,431
And if people pay .00001% chance to win

577
00:27:12,611 --> 00:27:15,493
or .000001% chance to win,

578
00:27:16,173 --> 00:27:17,674
mentally they put that in the same bucket.

579
00:27:18,455 --> 00:27:19,836
Just like the $3,000 and the $4,000

580
00:27:20,356 --> 00:27:22,177
or the $1 million and the $2 million.

581
00:27:22,397 --> 00:27:23,878
Once probabilities get really high,

582
00:27:24,179 --> 00:27:26,360
million to one, 200 million to one, 300 million to one,

583
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,781
people have no idea of what that is.

584
00:27:35,158 --> 00:27:36,059
OK.

585
00:27:36,699 --> 00:27:40,242
This is one of my favorite studies from 2012,

586
00:27:40,322 --> 00:27:42,044
the Chicago Teacher Bonus Study.

587
00:27:42,644 --> 00:27:45,406
They went into a classroom in Chicago,

588
00:27:45,446 --> 00:27:46,487
and they gave three different.

589
00:27:47,989 --> 00:27:50,670
bonus plans to different groups of teachers.

590
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:53,031
One was just the control group, no bonus plan.

591
00:27:53,551 --> 00:27:54,951
The other one was a more traditional,

592
00:27:55,231 --> 00:27:56,272
merit-based bonus plan,

593
00:27:56,292 --> 00:27:57,832
was they gave the students tests at the beginning of the year

594
00:27:57,852 --> 00:27:58,412
and the end of the year,

595
00:27:58,432 --> 00:27:59,493
and if they got to a certain level,

596
00:28:00,013 --> 00:28:01,073
then the teachers got a bonus.

597
00:28:01,734 --> 00:28:04,775
Then group three got $10,000 at the beginning of the year,

598
00:28:05,455 --> 00:28:06,095
and they told them,

599
00:28:06,775 --> 00:28:08,236
if the students don't reach this test score,

600
00:28:08,256 --> 00:28:08,976
you have to give it back.

601
00:28:10,977 --> 00:28:12,157
And of the three groups,

602
00:28:12,317 --> 00:28:13,877
only group number three actually showed

603
00:28:13,917 --> 00:28:14,938
any improvement in test scores.

604
00:28:19,248 --> 00:28:22,688
So, you know, there's a couple of issues with this study

605
00:28:22,708 --> 00:28:24,729
and I always teach these things with a grain of salt.

606
00:28:25,429 --> 00:28:27,050
You know, there's always a novelty factor.

607
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:28,870
I don't have time to go into details on that here,

608
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:30,851
but typically just changing things up,

609
00:28:31,551 --> 00:28:33,851
doing something different will make people react differently.

610
00:28:35,072 --> 00:28:36,312
You can't implement it in a large scale.

611
00:28:36,332 --> 00:28:37,772
I actually tried to do this in my company

612
00:28:37,832 --> 00:28:39,513
and I decided that it was just never gonna work.

613
00:28:40,973 --> 00:28:44,214
But the point remains that giving something to people,

614
00:28:44,714 --> 00:28:46,715
you know, just most people when they see this idea,

615
00:28:47,529 --> 00:28:50,511
of getting a bonus at the start of the year and you have to give it back if you don't

616
00:28:50,551 --> 00:28:56,195
perform. It's very stressful. Even though again financially it's really the same thing

617
00:28:56,295 --> 00:29:00,237
you know if you just put it aside you put it in a box you can make it the same as group

618
00:29:00,257 --> 00:29:06,721
number 2. But people just don't do that. So in a game as a game example if you're doing

619
00:29:06,741 --> 00:29:11,604
a pick up and deliver board game. Just as a little twist on it is you could have your

620
00:29:11,644 --> 00:29:15,526
players get paid in advance. You pick up a contract card and.

621
00:29:16,074 --> 00:29:18,355
it says you get $100 for this card,

622
00:29:18,415 --> 00:29:20,516
but you have to deliver this good in three turns.

623
00:29:20,576 --> 00:29:21,917
If you don't deliver the good in three turns,

624
00:29:21,937 --> 00:29:23,098
you have to give the $100 back.

625
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:26,100
Same idea as a really basic thing,

626
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,500
but just that little bit of a twist

627
00:29:27,701 --> 00:29:29,982
is gonna change the emotional investment of the players.

628
00:29:34,525 --> 00:29:34,805
Okay.

629
00:29:37,827 --> 00:29:38,447
Need a volunteer.

630
00:29:38,827 --> 00:29:39,148
You, sir.

631
00:29:41,849 --> 00:29:42,370
This is what I'm gonna do.

632
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:48,326
I have here, because I always travel with dice, I have a red die and I have a white

633
00:29:48,346 --> 00:29:48,526
die.

634
00:29:49,647 --> 00:29:52,389
I'm going to put the red die in one cup and the white die in the other cup.

635
00:29:52,409 --> 00:29:53,270
You have to try to guess.

636
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:55,012
You're trying to find the red die.

637
00:29:57,394 --> 00:29:58,094
There's no trick here.

638
00:29:59,896 --> 00:30:00,677
I'm just going to mix them up.

639
00:30:07,223 --> 00:30:10,225
If you are correct, you will win $5.

640
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,935
Here we go. So which one would you like to pick?

641
00:30:15,955 --> 00:30:17,635
It's cheating because I can already see.

642
00:30:17,915 --> 00:30:18,516
Oh, you can tell.

643
00:30:18,536 --> 00:30:20,076
Oh, jeez.

644
00:30:20,296 --> 00:30:21,436
I need to get opaque cups.

645
00:30:24,117 --> 00:30:24,497
Okay.

646
00:30:24,717 --> 00:30:25,397
You sure win for me.

647
00:30:26,097 --> 00:30:28,058
Well, I should give you five dollars just for playing the odds.

648
00:30:28,818 --> 00:30:29,098
Okay.

649
00:30:29,498 --> 00:30:29,678
Well,

650
00:30:31,678 --> 00:30:32,718
pick, I think you pick a cup.

651
00:30:33,399 --> 00:30:34,899
Most people when I do this demonstration,

652
00:30:35,179 --> 00:30:36,539
when I use the correct materials,

653
00:30:37,619 --> 00:30:38,260
this backlighting.

654
00:30:43,092 --> 00:30:45,432
What I usually do is I will offer somebody to pick a cup

655
00:30:46,132 --> 00:30:47,252
and they pick a cup and I will say,

656
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:49,973
okay, if you stick with this cup and it is correct,

657
00:30:51,113 --> 00:30:52,113
I will give you $5, okay?

658
00:30:53,454 --> 00:30:56,514
Or if you want to, you can switch to the other one

659
00:30:56,814 --> 00:30:59,295
and I give them an opportunity to switch to the other cup.

660
00:30:59,695 --> 00:31:03,296
And again, if you switch, you'll win the $5 either way.

661
00:31:04,476 --> 00:31:08,157
Most people, a vast, vast number of people

662
00:31:08,197 --> 00:31:10,497
will not switch away from their initial choice.

663
00:31:11,998 --> 00:31:12,158
So.

664
00:31:13,554 --> 00:31:14,634
The next thing is I will offer $6.

665
00:31:16,815 --> 00:31:19,355
They will win $6 if they switch and they're right,

666
00:31:19,675 --> 00:31:21,676
$5 if they stay, $7, $8, $9.

667
00:31:23,356 --> 00:31:25,456
People don't like to switch their choice.

668
00:31:26,597 --> 00:31:28,397
And this is a concept that's called regret.

669
00:31:29,657 --> 00:31:31,858
And there's been a lot of studies about this

670
00:31:32,638 --> 00:31:34,858
and this specific die in the cup study

671
00:31:35,398 --> 00:31:37,279
used with actual opaque cups.

672
00:31:38,019 --> 00:31:39,099
I'll have to remember that for next time.

673
00:31:40,427 --> 00:31:45,911
They find that when the values are equal, $5 if you stay with your original pick, that

674
00:31:46,351 --> 00:31:47,172
10% of people will switch.

675
00:31:49,194 --> 00:31:53,457
If you triple the value of the offer, if I say $15 if you switch and you're right, $5

676
00:31:54,278 --> 00:31:56,319
if you stay, 50% of people will switch.

677
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:01,284
And if you go to 10 times, that's when you can get 90% of people to switch.

678
00:32:02,625 --> 00:32:08,069
I was surprised at how high it went on these things, but most people do not like to switch.

679
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:12,932
So switching to a wrong choice feels three times as bad

680
00:32:14,013 --> 00:32:15,574
as making the wrong choice originally.

681
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,675
And this goes back, you remember in the beginning

682
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:20,977
I said that the loss feels twice as bad as the gain?

683
00:32:21,577 --> 00:32:23,638
This is one of the studies that kind of feeds into this.

684
00:32:24,819 --> 00:32:27,300
So the old advice that you get on a multiple choice test

685
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:30,042
to stick with your initial answer, if you pick A,

686
00:32:31,128 --> 00:32:32,389
and later on you have second,

687
00:32:32,649 --> 00:32:34,410
you're second guessing yourself, don't switch.

688
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:37,031
I really believe that it is mostly

689
00:32:37,091 --> 00:32:38,412
because you don't wanna feel worse.

690
00:32:38,452 --> 00:32:40,593
If you pick A and you switch to C and then A was right,

691
00:32:40,733 --> 00:32:42,233
you're gonna feel worse than if you picked A,

692
00:32:42,593 --> 00:32:44,154
stuck with A and it turned out C was right.

693
00:32:45,615 --> 00:32:46,915
Most people will try to avoid this.

694
00:32:48,936 --> 00:32:49,356
So from...

695
00:32:54,379 --> 00:32:55,639
Okay, we'll come back to that in a second.

696
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:57,960
Okay, so.

697
00:32:59,995 --> 00:33:01,296
This game I can play with these cups.

698
00:33:03,757 --> 00:33:05,757
So in this case, although I'm not actually going to play it,

699
00:33:07,198 --> 00:33:09,019
I'm going to offer you, what I'm going to do

700
00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:09,999
is I'm going to roll a die.

701
00:33:10,339 --> 00:33:12,960
Well, the game is that a die is going to be rolled,

702
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,901
and you have to decide whether it's even or odd.

703
00:33:15,781 --> 00:33:16,261
That's your pick.

704
00:33:17,101 --> 00:33:18,822
So you have a choice of two different games to play,

705
00:33:19,442 --> 00:33:20,843
one of which we could actually play with this.

706
00:33:21,823 --> 00:33:26,385
One is you make your pick, whether it's even or odd,

707
00:33:26,785 --> 00:33:27,625
and then I roll the die.

708
00:33:29,442 --> 00:33:32,804
Choice B is, I roll the die, I look at it,

709
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:37,126
I put it under a cup, but I don't tell you what it is,

710
00:33:37,406 --> 00:33:38,587
and then I ask you to make your pick.

711
00:33:40,408 --> 00:33:44,650
So how many people would rather take game A in this example?

712
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,571
And how many people would rather have B?

713
00:33:49,072 --> 00:33:50,693
So again, you guys are pretty much in line.

714
00:33:50,713 --> 00:33:51,934
About 2 thirds of people choose A.

715
00:33:54,583 --> 00:33:56,504
And this is a concept that's called competence.

716
00:33:57,145 --> 00:33:58,586
That's somewhat related to regret.

717
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:02,729
And the definition of competence is the amount

718
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:06,633
that you know in proportion to whatever can be known.

719
00:34:07,633 --> 00:34:10,215
And this was originally, these studies and this idea

720
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:11,957
was put forth by Tversky and Heath,

721
00:34:11,997 --> 00:34:14,119
that's the same Tversky of Kahneman and Tversky.

722
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:18,062
So in the first example, where I'm just gonna,

723
00:34:18,342 --> 00:34:21,304
you guess and then I roll, you know everything

724
00:34:21,324 --> 00:34:23,146
that there is to know in the world about this problem.

725
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:27,632
But on the second one, where I roll,

726
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:29,413
and it's under the cup and it's sitting there,

727
00:34:29,954 --> 00:34:31,495
there's information that exists

728
00:34:31,895 --> 00:34:33,196
that you don't have access to.

729
00:34:33,657 --> 00:34:35,418
So you feel less comfortable making the choice.

730
00:34:36,899 --> 00:34:40,862
So in a game perspective,

731
00:34:41,943 --> 00:34:43,044
a very simple game,

732
00:34:43,564 --> 00:34:45,546
if you have one player that's playing an attack card,

733
00:34:46,026 --> 00:34:46,526
punch or kick,

734
00:34:47,027 --> 00:34:49,008
and another plays playing a defense card,

735
00:34:49,569 --> 00:34:51,770
block, punch, block, kick, okay.

736
00:34:52,315 --> 00:34:54,677
Would you rather play your card first, play your card second?

737
00:34:56,518 --> 00:34:57,779
I haven't actually done this study,

738
00:34:57,859 --> 00:34:59,520
but I'm pretty confident that most people,

739
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,641
from my experience just anecdotally,

740
00:35:01,961 --> 00:35:03,522
are happier playing the card first when

741
00:35:03,542 --> 00:35:04,422
they make a choice like that.

742
00:35:05,143 --> 00:35:06,624
And then the other person will stare them down

743
00:35:06,684 --> 00:35:07,584
and try to figure it out.

744
00:35:08,765 --> 00:35:10,166
But certainly, if you want to put the pressure

745
00:35:10,206 --> 00:35:12,207
on the other person, picking your card first

746
00:35:12,507 --> 00:35:13,628
is going to be an easier choice.

747
00:35:20,523 --> 00:35:23,564
So relating to this is the idea of choice theory.

748
00:35:24,445 --> 00:35:27,486
So giving players too many choices is not a good thing.

749
00:35:28,466 --> 00:35:30,127
And there's been a lot of studies that have shown,

750
00:35:30,447 --> 00:35:31,848
in spite of the number of salad dressings

751
00:35:31,888 --> 00:35:33,048
that are available in the supermarket,

752
00:35:33,088 --> 00:35:34,989
that when your choices get to about more than seven,

753
00:35:35,069 --> 00:35:37,090
people's decision-making ability goes away

754
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:38,171
and gets much, much worse.

755
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:40,472
People avoid making a decision

756
00:35:40,512 --> 00:35:43,273
rather than making a wrong one.

757
00:35:44,353 --> 00:35:45,494
There was a study done on 401ks that,

758
00:35:48,373 --> 00:35:50,375
as they presented people with more options

759
00:35:50,535 --> 00:35:51,757
for where they put their investments,

760
00:35:53,338 --> 00:35:55,200
fewer and fewer people participated in the plan.

761
00:35:57,095 --> 00:35:59,637
From a game perspective, this is a game called Struggle of

762
00:35:59,697 --> 00:36:01,838
Empires done by Martin Wallace, which is a really

763
00:36:01,858 --> 00:36:03,338
terrific game for those of you who haven't played it.

764
00:36:03,758 --> 00:36:06,780
But one of the things that Wallace did which wasn't so

765
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:11,202
great is there's these special ability tiles that you can

766
00:36:11,242 --> 00:36:11,762
select from.

767
00:36:12,683 --> 00:36:15,344
And the very first thing you have to do in the game is you

768
00:36:15,364 --> 00:36:17,765
have to pick one of these tiles as what your special

769
00:36:17,785 --> 00:36:18,325
power is going to be.

770
00:36:18,345 --> 00:36:20,006
And they're all available at the start of the game.

771
00:36:20,026 --> 00:36:20,766
And there's about 30 of them.

772
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:23,867
And it's a really overwhelming choice.

773
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:25,568
It's great once you get into the game,

774
00:36:25,689 --> 00:36:26,829
and next time you play it,

775
00:36:26,849 --> 00:36:28,070
and you know what all these options are.

776
00:36:29,931 --> 00:36:31,672
But for new players, it's paralyzing.

777
00:36:32,953 --> 00:36:34,594
You have to go through all of these cards,

778
00:36:34,794 --> 00:36:36,595
and they're basically, you know,

779
00:36:36,615 --> 00:36:38,256
people later posted online, it was like,

780
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:39,436
look, if you're playing this game,

781
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:41,298
these are the three that you want to present,

782
00:36:41,798 --> 00:36:42,698
you know, for new players.

783
00:36:43,459 --> 00:36:45,660
Pick one of these three, and then they'll go with it.

784
00:36:46,647 --> 00:36:50,408
Having this many choices, especially for a new player that doesn't understand the context,

785
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:56,650
was a big mistake and fed right into this concept of regret and loss aversion.

786
00:37:01,632 --> 00:37:07,675
So, the endowment effect is another really interesting offshoot of this.

787
00:37:08,695 --> 00:37:12,156
And the idea of the endowment effect is that when you give something to somebody,

788
00:37:12,921 --> 00:37:14,581
that they ascribe it more value

789
00:37:15,221 --> 00:37:18,162
than if it was just off to the side or they didn't have it.

790
00:37:18,922 --> 00:37:20,442
The classic study that they did on this

791
00:37:20,502 --> 00:37:21,843
is they had participants do something

792
00:37:22,483 --> 00:37:23,543
and just in the beginning of it,

793
00:37:23,583 --> 00:37:25,903
they gave them a mug as a prize for it,

794
00:37:25,923 --> 00:37:27,644
they gave them a candy bar as a prize for it,

795
00:37:28,444 --> 00:37:30,644
and they then at the end of the study

796
00:37:30,704 --> 00:37:32,645
asked people if they wanted to switch to the other prize.

797
00:37:33,485 --> 00:37:34,585
Most people wouldn't switch.

798
00:37:35,785 --> 00:37:37,266
Even if they asked them beforehand,

799
00:37:37,386 --> 00:37:38,526
would you rather have a mug or would you rather have

800
00:37:38,546 --> 00:37:40,446
a candy bar, and they got the one they didn't want.

801
00:37:40,986 --> 00:37:42,127
Once they got that and they had it.

802
00:37:43,225 --> 00:37:46,830
that it was something that they just wanted to stick with.

803
00:37:47,831 --> 00:37:50,434
And this comes up a lot in games.

804
00:37:52,957 --> 00:37:58,323
So before I get to games, let me just talk about this.

805
00:37:58,383 --> 00:38:00,706
So this is the Rifleman's Creed.

806
00:38:01,693 --> 00:38:02,553
I think it's from the Army.

807
00:38:02,793 --> 00:38:03,934
I apologize if I'm wrong on that.

808
00:38:04,414 --> 00:38:06,595
But the idea is that you take an object

809
00:38:07,095 --> 00:38:10,897
and you personify it for the person who has it.

810
00:38:11,338 --> 00:38:12,978
And the endowment effect is something

811
00:38:12,998 --> 00:38:15,079
that happens naturally, but there are techniques

812
00:38:15,099 --> 00:38:16,300
that you can use to emphasize it.

813
00:38:17,741 --> 00:38:19,862
The Rifleman's Creed is one thing that does that.

814
00:38:20,822 --> 00:38:23,003
Another game that does that really effectively

815
00:38:23,143 --> 00:38:24,684
in the video game world is Portal.

816
00:38:25,704 --> 00:38:26,385
In the game Portal,

817
00:38:27,937 --> 00:38:29,238
For those that haven't played it,

818
00:38:29,358 --> 00:38:31,181
there's lots of cubes that are around

819
00:38:31,221 --> 00:38:33,123
that you push onto buttons and stuff like that.

820
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:35,967
But at one point, you are literally endowed

821
00:38:36,027 --> 00:38:38,370
with a special cube called the companion cube,

822
00:38:38,871 --> 00:38:40,553
which is a cube that has hearts on the side.

823
00:38:40,753 --> 00:38:41,995
And you're told that for the whole level,

824
00:38:42,015 --> 00:38:43,137
you have to carry it through the level.

825
00:38:44,098 --> 00:38:45,660
And then.

826
00:38:47,077 --> 00:38:49,378
you just very immediately naturally get attached

827
00:38:49,418 --> 00:38:51,019
to the level, attached to the cube.

828
00:38:51,539 --> 00:38:53,900
And they do certain tricks, they say certain things

829
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,381
throughout the level to get you more and more

830
00:38:55,421 --> 00:38:55,941
attached to it.

831
00:38:56,401 --> 00:38:58,282
It never says anything, it never does anything,

832
00:38:58,362 --> 00:38:58,983
it just sits there.

833
00:38:59,163 --> 00:39:02,044
But you get this attachment and then at the very end

834
00:39:02,064 --> 00:39:04,525
of the level, famously, you have to,

835
00:39:06,647 --> 00:39:08,247
everyone's played Portal, right, so spoiler.

836
00:39:09,428 --> 00:39:11,069
You have to incinerate the companion cube.

837
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:13,270
You have to literally take it and throw it

838
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:14,230
into the incinerator.

839
00:39:15,017 --> 00:39:17,078
And there's stories from the developers

840
00:39:17,118 --> 00:39:19,479
about how people have agonized over this

841
00:39:19,539 --> 00:39:21,500
and have waited, you know, tried to do other things

842
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:22,861
and see what they could do to avoid it.

843
00:39:23,801 --> 00:39:26,902
And it's just such a great example of a way to take this

844
00:39:27,143 --> 00:39:29,924
and use it as a way to manipulate the player experience

845
00:39:30,064 --> 00:39:31,325
and the emotions that they're feeling.

846
00:39:32,409 --> 00:39:33,931
You know, you could even do this in a board game.

847
00:39:33,951 --> 00:39:35,593
And I don't think board games have really done this,

848
00:39:35,674 --> 00:39:37,757
but you could certainly take, you know,

849
00:39:37,817 --> 00:39:40,942
included in a really cute little stuffed animal

850
00:39:40,982 --> 00:39:42,945
or something that goes to a certain player

851
00:39:42,965 --> 00:39:44,487
for doing something and then other player,

852
00:39:44,527 --> 00:39:46,250
you know, try to take away from it,

853
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:46,971
take it away from them.

854
00:39:47,473 --> 00:39:50,436
You know, usually those type of tokens or totems

855
00:39:50,896 --> 00:39:52,338
represent the players themselves,

856
00:39:52,378 --> 00:39:54,720
so we tend not to take them away, the really cool stuff.

857
00:39:55,621 --> 00:39:57,823
But there are certainly things that could be done with that.

858
00:39:58,343 --> 00:40:00,486
But you could give your players something,

859
00:40:00,526 --> 00:40:02,147
give them a pet, give them a sidekick,

860
00:40:02,427 --> 00:40:05,831
give them something, and then threaten to take it away.

861
00:40:06,491 --> 00:40:08,513
And that's gonna really up the emotional stakes

862
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:11,096
because of all of this psychology that we talked about.

863
00:40:13,237 --> 00:40:13,497
OK.

864
00:40:14,157 --> 00:40:17,199
The last thing I'd like to talk about, the last effect

865
00:40:17,219 --> 00:40:20,880
that I'd like to talk about, is called the Endowed Progress

866
00:40:21,041 --> 00:40:21,381
Effect.

867
00:40:22,141 --> 00:40:24,802
This is one of my personal favorites.

868
00:40:25,743 --> 00:40:28,944
So this is a car wash study that was done in 2006.

869
00:40:30,325 --> 00:40:33,847
The team went to a car wash, and they gave half the people

870
00:40:33,867 --> 00:40:35,988
that came to the car wash, they gave them the first ticket,

871
00:40:36,348 --> 00:40:39,450
and said, if you punch it eight times,

872
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:40,330
you'll get a free car wash.

873
00:40:41,469 --> 00:40:45,291
And the second group, the other half, they gave the second ticket, which had ten punches on it,

874
00:40:46,571 --> 00:40:47,812
but two of them were already punched.

875
00:40:48,272 --> 00:40:52,054
They said if you come back with, you know, the whole thing punched, you get a free car wash.

876
00:40:52,894 --> 00:40:55,375
So both cases, you have to come back to the car wash eight more times.

877
00:40:56,696 --> 00:40:57,977
And what they found was that

878
00:40:59,037 --> 00:41:02,379
the first ticket was redeemed completely 19% of the time,

879
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:04,740
and the second one almost double that.

880
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,421
Twice as many people completed the second ticket than the first.

881
00:41:08,941 --> 00:41:10,402
They had to do the same amount of effort.

882
00:41:11,662 --> 00:41:14,443
But they were given some progress.

883
00:41:14,483 --> 00:41:17,445
They were given what was called endowed progress.

884
00:41:18,905 --> 00:41:22,367
And it had a very strong psychological effect on people.

885
00:41:24,708 --> 00:41:26,929
People were on a journey already.

886
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:31,071
And once you're on that journey, you kind of

887
00:41:31,091 --> 00:41:33,292
have to take effort to walk away from it.

888
00:41:33,652 --> 00:41:37,494
But you're already given something,

889
00:41:37,534 --> 00:41:38,714
and you're worried that you're going to lose it.

890
00:41:38,914 --> 00:41:41,015
So it ties into all of that psychology.

891
00:41:42,634 --> 00:41:45,857
So there's a board game actually that uses this

892
00:41:45,937 --> 00:41:48,680
pretty famously, although I'm not sure

893
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,001
if he was really intended to,

894
00:41:50,682 --> 00:41:53,344
but in the Settlers of Catan, or Catan,

895
00:41:53,624 --> 00:41:55,526
I guess it's called now, I will never get used to that,

896
00:41:56,667 --> 00:41:58,509
but you have to get 10 victory points to win

897
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:00,811
and the players start with two victory points.

898
00:42:00,991 --> 00:42:04,595
So this is exactly the same case as the second

899
00:42:05,415 --> 00:42:08,977
car wash coupon where you got to get 10 points, but you've got your first 2

900
00:42:09,177 --> 00:42:11,819
punches. So you're already on the road to success.

901
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:15,561
Um, the cells of Catan actually came out before the car wash study was done,

902
00:42:15,601 --> 00:42:18,202
obviously. So I'm sure that it wasn't influenced by that,

903
00:42:18,642 --> 00:42:21,764
but I think it's really interesting to, uh, to, to,

904
00:42:21,984 --> 00:42:25,886
to see the way that the players were already moved down the road. You know,

905
00:42:25,966 --> 00:42:28,708
it would have been easy to say you have to get eight additional points or had a

906
00:42:28,748 --> 00:42:31,389
little scoring track or something like that, but that's not what the game does.

907
00:42:31,449 --> 00:42:34,291
The game says you got to get 10 points, but everybody starts at two.

908
00:42:37,366 --> 00:42:41,948
So again, all of these things come out

909
00:42:42,128 --> 00:42:43,509
of this concept of loss aversion.

910
00:42:43,969 --> 00:42:46,151
And over the years, I've learned more and more about,

911
00:42:47,251 --> 00:42:48,632
learned about these different psychologies

912
00:42:48,692 --> 00:42:51,173
and it's just fascinating how it always comes back

913
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:54,615
to that basic idea that losing stuff feels bad

914
00:42:54,815 --> 00:42:56,816
and feels worse than getting it does in the first place.

915
00:42:57,576 --> 00:42:59,678
So framing, regret, the endowment effects,

916
00:42:59,998 --> 00:43:02,279
all of this stuff comes into play.

917
00:43:05,561 --> 00:43:07,242
It's a really, you know, when you're aware of it,

918
00:43:07,382 --> 00:43:08,843
it's both interesting in your own life

919
00:43:09,063 --> 00:43:10,284
when you see how it's affecting you

920
00:43:10,324 --> 00:43:11,145
and things that you can do,

921
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:13,986
but also in terms of game design of using it

922
00:43:14,867 --> 00:43:18,469
really as a tool, as a scalpel to push the players

923
00:43:18,549 --> 00:43:20,830
into the emotional state that you're looking for them

924
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:23,011
to experience.

925
00:43:23,472 --> 00:43:26,133
So that's all I have prepared.

926
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:27,014
Thank you very much.

927
00:43:27,694 --> 00:43:29,415
And be happy to take any questions.

928
00:43:38,418 --> 00:43:39,678
I think there's two microphones,

929
00:43:40,099 --> 00:43:41,319
if anybody has any questions.

930
00:43:49,803 --> 00:43:50,003
Yes.

931
00:43:52,224 --> 00:43:55,725
So I feel like I'm the only person ever

932
00:43:55,805 --> 00:43:59,367
who didn't get attached to the companion Cuban portal.

933
00:43:59,787 --> 00:44:02,188
No, you're, yeah.

934
00:44:02,308 --> 00:44:03,489
And just to kind of keep it in the...

935
00:44:04,907 --> 00:44:07,489
the sort of the universe of what you've been talking about.

936
00:44:07,589 --> 00:44:10,450
I feel like the reason that I didn't

937
00:44:11,551 --> 00:44:14,172
is because the game up until that point,

938
00:44:14,452 --> 00:44:16,493
I more felt like the game was framing

939
00:44:16,833 --> 00:44:20,175
what I was doing as a relationship with GLaDOS

940
00:44:20,275 --> 00:44:23,437
more than the companion cube.

941
00:44:23,477 --> 00:44:26,018
And so this was like an instance of

942
00:44:29,908 --> 00:44:31,349
kind of a point in that relationship.

943
00:44:31,369 --> 00:44:33,469
So I guess if I were to take that

944
00:44:33,489 --> 00:44:34,870
and turn it into a question, I would say,

945
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:36,550
what do you think about like,

946
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:43,072
how can framing kind of backfire, I guess?

947
00:44:44,392 --> 00:44:47,393
Well, first off, I will say that my niece,

948
00:44:47,433 --> 00:44:48,753
who's a lot younger than my kids,

949
00:44:49,193 --> 00:44:50,493
came over about a year ago,

950
00:44:50,553 --> 00:44:52,334
and my kids insisted on playing Portal with her,

951
00:44:52,514 --> 00:44:54,694
and she like immediately took the companion cube

952
00:44:54,734 --> 00:44:56,535
and threw it in the fire,

953
00:44:56,935 --> 00:44:59,135
and they were, my kids were horrified.

954
00:45:00,797 --> 00:45:01,878
I'd say, how could you do that?

955
00:45:02,058 --> 00:45:03,539
And felt that she immediately needed

956
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:05,461
to be sent for some sort of psychological counseling.

957
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:11,126
But the key is to draw the line between,

958
00:45:14,208 --> 00:45:15,810
you don't want to see the wizard behind,

959
00:45:15,830 --> 00:45:16,970
the man behind the curtain.

960
00:45:17,771 --> 00:45:20,173
You want to do it in a way that's subtle.

961
00:45:20,253 --> 00:45:22,915
And if people start to feel that they're being manipulated,

962
00:45:23,316 --> 00:45:24,537
they're going to push back against it.

963
00:45:24,637 --> 00:45:27,019
And that's why, even at the beginning of this talk,

964
00:45:27,079 --> 00:45:29,000
and I talk about this, just go with your gut.

965
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,401
Don't try to outthink it.

966
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:34,042
I think if people are doing that or in a different place

967
00:45:34,163 --> 00:45:37,004
in a mindset, then you can have a problem.

968
00:45:37,024 --> 00:45:38,445
So you want to use the tools,

969
00:45:40,287 --> 00:45:41,708
I think you want to use them sparingly.

970
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:44,209
And you can get into a situation, yeah,

971
00:45:44,229 --> 00:45:45,150
where people backfire.

972
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:46,591
We didn't talk about it a little bit,

973
00:45:46,631 --> 00:45:49,253
but even there's a lot of techniques like this

974
00:45:49,293 --> 00:45:52,315
that are used in free-to-play games or freemium-type games

975
00:45:52,335 --> 00:45:53,916
where you're trying to get people to buy other stuff.

976
00:45:54,496 --> 00:45:56,518
And if it's done in a real heavy-handed way,

977
00:45:57,178 --> 00:45:58,279
it's gonna turn people off.

978
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:01,498
Yeah.

979
00:46:02,179 --> 00:46:06,720
I guess this is related to loss aversion for often

980
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:10,320
like oblique multiplayer games where you may be adversarial

981
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:14,381
towards other players, but that may just be optional

982
00:46:14,441 --> 00:46:15,081
and perhaps not.

983
00:46:16,142 --> 00:46:18,342
When you can attribute the loss of something you care about

984
00:46:18,822 --> 00:46:21,783
to the game itself, that's a fairly neutral feeling.

985
00:46:21,803 --> 00:46:23,903
There's no villain there necessarily,

986
00:46:23,943 --> 00:46:25,344
unless the game has an antagonist,

987
00:46:25,364 --> 00:46:26,524
which is a non-player character.

988
00:46:26,964 --> 00:46:28,364
When you're playing a multiplayer game

989
00:46:28,424 --> 00:46:29,785
and perhaps sometimes you're...

990
00:46:30,606 --> 00:46:34,450
you're attempting to avert loss tied to another player

991
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:37,933
or attempting to be the reason that someone else loses

992
00:46:37,973 --> 00:46:41,856
something, this is something that I'm

993
00:46:41,896 --> 00:46:43,358
interested to explore.

994
00:46:43,418 --> 00:46:48,483
Have you done any studies which involve averting loss player

995
00:46:48,523 --> 00:46:49,964
to player versus player to game?

996
00:46:54,059 --> 00:46:58,120
I think that to a certain extent, I haven't specifically studied that or looked at that.

997
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:03,581
My initial instinct is that yeah, I mean there certainly is, like if you look at Monopoly

998
00:47:03,641 --> 00:47:07,903
or there's plenty of games where players are taking stuff away from other players and that's

999
00:47:07,943 --> 00:47:09,223
really the objective of the game.

1000
00:47:09,963 --> 00:47:15,725
And I think that it triggers this stuff, but I think if it's from...

1001
00:47:17,444 --> 00:47:20,486
from a systemic way, if it's done from the point of view of the game,

1002
00:47:20,926 --> 00:47:22,747
I think it can be a little bit more intimidating.

1003
00:47:23,487 --> 00:47:26,049
Almost like walking into a casino and there's this, you know,

1004
00:47:26,069 --> 00:47:29,030
you're playing against the house is different than if you're at a poker table

1005
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:30,451
and you're playing against another player.

1006
00:47:31,031 --> 00:47:34,553
So I think the idea of authority also kind of factors into it in some sense.

1007
00:47:35,493 --> 00:47:37,294
But I think that it's...

1008
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:40,631
So I think that you want to have the,

1009
00:47:40,931 --> 00:47:43,532
I think having the game do it is more effective

1010
00:47:43,552 --> 00:47:45,013
than having other players do it.

1011
00:47:45,213 --> 00:47:48,775
I think that the game telling you to take a card

1012
00:47:49,515 --> 00:47:53,597
and tear it up is perhaps more, I don't know, maybe not,

1013
00:47:53,737 --> 00:47:55,758
more effective than having another player

1014
00:47:55,819 --> 00:47:57,039
is allowed to reach into your hand

1015
00:47:57,079 --> 00:47:58,160
and pull out a card and rip it up.

1016
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:00,421
It depends on the reaction.

1017
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:02,962
Yeah, it depends on your relationship with your friends.

1018
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:06,567
But, you know, I think that they,

1019
00:48:06,647 --> 00:48:09,155
there's a little bit of a subtle distinction there

1020
00:48:09,175 --> 00:48:10,278
in terms of how they trigger things.

1021
00:48:12,379 --> 00:48:18,060
Hi. With the card game example, you mentioned how there's cards that kind of have a negative

1022
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:22,921
reaction, even though gameplay-wise they might be more beneficial than some other options.

1023
00:48:23,742 --> 00:48:28,443
And many people who play a lot of card games will actually kind of internalize those, you

1024
00:48:28,463 --> 00:48:31,083
know, it doesn't matter how many cards you pitch, it only matters about the cards you

1025
00:48:31,103 --> 00:48:35,784
need to win, et cetera, et cetera. Do you find that people who get into that mindset

1026
00:48:35,884 --> 00:48:40,826
typically only have that affect those particular situations with those card games or do you

1027
00:48:40,866 --> 00:48:41,786
find that they also...

1028
00:48:42,788 --> 00:48:46,887
in other risk aversion situations have maybe a lower threshold there.

1029
00:48:48,226 --> 00:48:51,587
I think first off, you can totally be habituated

1030
00:48:51,647 --> 00:48:52,568
away from loss aversion.

1031
00:48:52,828 --> 00:48:54,329
And there's tons of studies that have been done

1032
00:48:54,369 --> 00:48:57,610
like on stockbrokers, and maybe initially when they start,

1033
00:48:57,710 --> 00:49:00,751
you know, like the casual person that's buying

1034
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:04,613
and selling stock will have an issue with, you know,

1035
00:49:05,073 --> 00:49:06,733
holding on for stock for too long

1036
00:49:06,853 --> 00:49:09,414
to avoid the loss aversion and the loss of selling the stock.

1037
00:49:10,115 --> 00:49:13,276
But with a stockbroker, they start out

1038
00:49:13,316 --> 00:49:14,376
with a little bit of loss aversion,

1039
00:49:14,396 --> 00:49:15,857
but if you just do it day in and day out

1040
00:49:15,877 --> 00:49:16,617
and day in and day out,

1041
00:49:17,115 --> 00:49:20,177
you get over it. The tracking example in Hearthstone, you know,

1042
00:49:20,317 --> 00:49:21,939
once you play the game a lot, you,

1043
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:25,382
you get past that and you see the utility of the card. Um,

1044
00:49:25,602 --> 00:49:30,125
I am not aware of any studies specifically that says if,

1045
00:49:30,586 --> 00:49:30,806
you know,

1046
00:49:30,846 --> 00:49:34,229
if you're a stockbroker and you're used to doing this and you transplant into a

1047
00:49:34,289 --> 00:49:38,252
different environment about whether that goes with you, um, I would.

1048
00:49:39,102 --> 00:49:46,310
With no real evidence, I would speculate that it probably does, to a certain extent.

1049
00:49:47,171 --> 00:49:51,797
But the first part is you can definitely, you know, you will be habituated out of law

1050
00:49:51,997 --> 00:49:55,001
subversion if you're paying attention to it or doing it over and over again.

1051
00:49:58,452 --> 00:50:00,514
Hi, oh, sorry, yeah, that's quite high.

1052
00:50:01,014 --> 00:50:05,178
So I was just gonna ask, a lot of what you talked about

1053
00:50:05,238 --> 00:50:07,240
and the studies that you referenced

1054
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:11,063
focus on specific sort of small scale choices

1055
00:50:11,183 --> 00:50:12,604
within a larger whole.

1056
00:50:12,704 --> 00:50:15,226
So you know, like the level draining being a mechanic

1057
00:50:15,306 --> 00:50:18,249
within, you know, obviously a wider game.

1058
00:50:18,649 --> 00:50:22,713
So I was wondering how you feel loss aversion applies.

1059
00:50:23,373 --> 00:50:25,956
across perhaps a game as a whole?

1060
00:50:26,057 --> 00:50:29,801
So the time investment or the sense of loss if you didn't,

1061
00:50:30,202 --> 00:50:33,466
you know, accumulate your victory points before everybody else or,

1062
00:50:33,886 --> 00:50:35,108
you know, that level?

1063
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:40,175
I'm sorry, I'm not sure I totally understand the question.

1064
00:50:40,195 --> 00:50:41,936
You mean like on a, that the whole game

1065
00:50:41,996 --> 00:50:42,877
is kind of built around that?

1066
00:50:42,897 --> 00:50:44,758
Yeah, because it seemed like everything

1067
00:50:44,838 --> 00:50:46,519
that was mentioned in the talk

1068
00:50:46,599 --> 00:50:49,782
was about the specific steps within the whole.

1069
00:50:49,942 --> 00:50:50,142
Yeah.

1070
00:50:50,262 --> 00:50:52,644
But I was wondering whether there was kind of a broader

1071
00:50:53,384 --> 00:50:56,346
loss aversion that applies once all of these things

1072
00:50:56,406 --> 00:50:59,548
are folded in and it gets more complicated or more woolly.

1073
00:50:59,568 --> 00:51:01,269
Yeah, I mean, I think that you can certainly

1074
00:51:01,309 --> 00:51:04,131
take aspects of this and, you know, loss aversion

1075
00:51:06,475 --> 00:51:10,537
you know, perhaps, you know, at its sharpest is going to be,

1076
00:51:10,957 --> 00:51:13,838
you know, that critical pivot point in a game

1077
00:51:13,898 --> 00:51:16,199
or an experience, whether it's throwing away the companion cube

1078
00:51:16,359 --> 00:51:20,300
or Floyd the robot in Planetfall, where, you know,

1079
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,241
you lose a companion or something like that

1080
00:51:23,301 --> 00:51:24,881
and you feel the loss immediately.

1081
00:51:26,282 --> 00:51:27,622
But, you know, I think you could,

1082
00:51:27,983 --> 00:51:31,124
and there have been some games like Brothers and others

1083
00:51:31,164 --> 00:51:34,405
that try to take that concept of loss and explore it.

1084
00:51:35,045 --> 00:51:39,487
But you have to go through that setup phase to tweak it

1085
00:51:39,607 --> 00:51:40,908
and then go from there.

1086
00:51:41,588 --> 00:51:42,049
OK, cool.

1087
00:51:42,109 --> 00:51:42,449
Thank you.

1088
00:51:42,589 --> 00:51:44,030
Sure.

1089
00:51:44,050 --> 00:51:44,890
Hi.

1090
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:47,291
Going back to your example with the $3,000 against the $4,000,

1091
00:51:47,892 --> 00:51:54,055
I was wondering if we modified the $4,000 option so that even

1092
00:51:54,075 --> 00:51:58,097
with a lower expected value, or a higher expected value,

1093
00:51:58,198 --> 00:51:58,578
if the

1094
00:52:00,139 --> 00:52:03,883
Instead of getting nothing the partial time you just get less

1095
00:52:05,084 --> 00:52:05,625
so if it was

1096
00:52:06,365 --> 00:52:06,846
$1,000 and

1097
00:52:07,326 --> 00:52:12,712
5,000 as the two possible outcomes against the short 3,000 if it would be different and I don't know if yeah

1098
00:52:12,892 --> 00:52:15,976
I think that's a really interesting point. I you know nothing

1099
00:52:16,917 --> 00:52:21,059
Zero, there's some numbers that are really just go off

1100
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,940
into different areas of people's brains

1101
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:26,222
and nothing is one of them.

1102
00:52:26,342 --> 00:52:28,583
100% is something, you know, or like, you know,

1103
00:52:28,663 --> 00:52:31,384
so if I tell you that there's a 100% chance

1104
00:52:31,424 --> 00:52:35,006
that something's gonna happen versus a 99.99% chance

1105
00:52:35,026 --> 00:52:38,508
something's gonna happen, you don't focus on the fact

1106
00:52:38,548 --> 00:52:41,109
that it's 99.999%, you focus on the fact

1107
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:42,450
that there's a chance that it may not happen.

1108
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,261
and then you're really going to get hosed.

1109
00:52:44,381 --> 00:52:47,104
So, you know, 100% a guaranteed sure thing

1110
00:52:47,264 --> 00:52:49,686
is a totally different kind of part of your brain.

1111
00:52:49,746 --> 00:52:51,807
So, and it's the same thing with zero dollars.

1112
00:52:52,748 --> 00:52:56,091
And you even see that at, you know,

1113
00:52:56,171 --> 00:52:57,592
at trade shows and stuff like that.

1114
00:52:57,972 --> 00:53:01,575
You know, just yesterday over in the other hall,

1115
00:53:02,676 --> 00:53:05,118
this booth was giving away ViewMasters.

1116
00:53:06,403 --> 00:53:08,284
the little 3D ViewMaster clicky things.

1117
00:53:08,924 --> 00:53:11,145
I don't need a ViewMaster, but I got it

1118
00:53:11,225 --> 00:53:12,366
because it was there on the table, it was free.

1119
00:53:12,406 --> 00:53:14,027
If they turned to penny for the ViewMaster,

1120
00:53:14,047 --> 00:53:16,308
I never would have gotten it, but I stood on line,

1121
00:53:16,348 --> 00:53:18,289
I would talk to the guy, I wanted the ViewMaster

1122
00:53:18,329 --> 00:53:19,069
because it was free.

1123
00:53:19,169 --> 00:53:20,830
So I think, yeah, I mean, having,

1124
00:53:21,351 --> 00:53:24,092
there's certain things that are treated in a very,

1125
00:53:24,672 --> 00:53:25,773
free is different than a penny.

1126
00:53:26,253 --> 00:53:27,974
And 99.999 is different than 100.

1127
00:53:28,014 --> 00:53:31,316
And you can use that as part of the manipulation, sure.

1128
00:53:31,336 --> 00:53:32,476
Thank you.

1129
00:53:34,097 --> 00:53:34,137
Hi.

1130
00:53:34,722 --> 00:53:37,263
I was just wondering if you have any reading recommendations

1131
00:53:37,363 --> 00:53:39,224
about incorporating this either into games

1132
00:53:39,404 --> 00:53:41,904
or even just broader behavioral psychology.

1133
00:53:41,924 --> 00:53:43,405
Yeah, I mean, the best book on this

1134
00:53:43,665 --> 00:53:47,486
is written by Kahneman a couple of years ago called

1135
00:53:47,546 --> 00:53:48,987
Thinking, Fast and Slow.

1136
00:53:49,767 --> 00:53:51,287
I can't recommend that book highly enough.

1137
00:53:51,967 --> 00:53:54,688
It covers a lot of this territory

1138
00:53:54,728 --> 00:53:57,529
and goes even into deeper types of stuff.

1139
00:53:58,569 --> 00:54:00,990
He talks about endings, which is really just a whole other talk.

1140
00:54:01,590 --> 00:54:04,455
where he talks about colonoscopies and how that applies

1141
00:54:04,515 --> 00:54:06,337
to whether you enjoy an experience or not,

1142
00:54:06,438 --> 00:54:08,861
which is a whole other game development talk.

1143
00:54:09,682 --> 00:54:12,026
Spoiler alert, the ending is really, really important.

1144
00:54:12,867 --> 00:54:14,830
So yeah, I would definitely recommend that book,

1145
00:54:14,870 --> 00:54:15,832
Thinking Fast and Slow.

1146
00:54:16,372 --> 00:54:17,274
Thanks a lot. Sure.

1147
00:54:17,959 --> 00:54:18,840
Yeah.

1148
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:19,300
Hi.

1149
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:23,584
I was curious, when you were talking about the example of, say, the companion cube and

1150
00:54:23,644 --> 00:54:28,789
giving the player something and then taking it away, what is, or do you have any ideas

1151
00:54:28,849 --> 00:54:35,394
or studies about, like, the effect of then giving that back to the player, essentially?

1152
00:54:35,434 --> 00:54:39,358
Like, if the companion cube, for example, showed up, like, three levels later, what

1153
00:54:39,378 --> 00:54:41,119
would the emotional effect be on the player?

1154
00:54:42,701 --> 00:54:44,742
You want the Hollywood ending from...

1155
00:54:46,455 --> 00:54:49,698
when dramatically a singed companion cube

1156
00:54:49,818 --> 00:54:52,160
comes into the last scene of the game as it's brought back.

1157
00:54:53,261 --> 00:54:55,343
Yeah, I mean, I think that there's

1158
00:54:55,363 --> 00:54:57,965
certain expectations in movies and storytelling in general

1159
00:54:58,085 --> 00:54:59,587
that a lot of times that sometimes

1160
00:54:59,607 --> 00:55:00,648
those characters come back.

1161
00:55:01,336 --> 00:55:05,458
And that's used to varying effects in different genres.

1162
00:55:05,478 --> 00:55:09,140
You know, in the movies, I guess Obi-Wan comes back again

1163
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:11,261
at the end of episode six as a ghost,

1164
00:55:11,321 --> 00:55:13,002
but at least he's there and stuff like that.

1165
00:55:14,503 --> 00:55:16,384
I think it may give the player a little bit

1166
00:55:16,404 --> 00:55:17,524
of a sense of completeness,

1167
00:55:18,105 --> 00:55:20,626
but I don't think it's really necessary to get the effect.

1168
00:55:21,226 --> 00:55:22,727
You know, they should have no expectation

1169
00:55:22,767 --> 00:55:23,447
that it's gonna come back,

1170
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:24,388
and you should really convince them

1171
00:55:24,408 --> 00:55:25,048
that they're really gone,

1172
00:55:25,088 --> 00:55:26,909
otherwise it kinda cheapens the effect

1173
00:55:27,349 --> 00:55:28,650
if they think they could get it back.

1174
00:55:29,171 --> 00:55:35,261
that's a different situation because you've lost something but I have a method of getting it back.

1175
00:55:35,361 --> 00:55:36,563
Okay, thank you.

1176
00:55:37,906 --> 00:55:42,393
Hi, so you started your talk with the example of kind of making a bet on

1177
00:55:43,164 --> 00:55:46,228
a 50-50 chance, right, with the coin toss.

1178
00:55:46,989 --> 00:55:52,316
I'm interested in lots of multiplayer games now, you know, there is the concept of a zero-sum

1179
00:55:52,336 --> 00:55:55,180
scenario where you're betting something against your opponent.

1180
00:55:56,462 --> 00:55:59,887
And I'm wondering if you look, for instance, at the trophy mechanic in Clash Royale.

1181
00:56:00,467 --> 00:56:04,408
right, where if you win you gain certain amount of trophies and if you lose it actually takes

1182
00:56:04,428 --> 00:56:09,810
them away from you. Now that's not, it's not always the same number. Using your understanding

1183
00:56:09,830 --> 00:56:14,992
of kind of loss aversion and how to, you know, optimize the player psychology through this

1184
00:56:15,032 --> 00:56:20,013
process, I'm wondering if you have any kind of view on how to design such a trophy system

1185
00:56:20,033 --> 00:56:24,194
in that way, in terms of what you take away and what you give. Yeah, I think that

1186
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:27,301
I'm not familiar with Clash Royale,

1187
00:56:27,321 --> 00:56:28,541
but there's a similar thing.

1188
00:56:29,501 --> 00:56:30,581
I showed the Hearthstone example,

1189
00:56:30,601 --> 00:56:32,682
and I think that Blizzard did a really nice job

1190
00:56:32,762 --> 00:56:35,102
with their ranked system in Hearthstone

1191
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:36,423
with a couple of tricks to do that.

1192
00:56:37,743 --> 00:56:40,404
Where first off, there's the win streak mechanic.

1193
00:56:40,524 --> 00:56:44,385
So if you win a couple games in a row, you get bonus stars.

1194
00:56:46,365 --> 00:56:49,006
And the other thing is that also when you lose stars,

1195
00:56:51,025 --> 00:56:54,967
there's when you go up a level in in hearthstone there's when you go when you

1196
00:56:55,007 --> 00:57:00,670
get to level four or I've never made it to level of rank four but for me rank

1197
00:57:01,091 --> 00:57:05,453
19 when you're at rank 19 and you go to 18 if you lose immediately after getting

1198
00:57:05,493 --> 00:57:09,896
to 18 you stay at 18 there's like a weird little half level thing inside

1199
00:57:09,936 --> 00:57:13,958
there so from 19 you go up to like 18 and then you go down like 18 0 and if

1200
00:57:13,978 --> 00:57:16,860
you lose again you you go you drop down to the same step under 19

1201
00:57:18,082 --> 00:57:22,725
So I think that in that case, they also try to soften the blow because they're trying to be friendlier,

1202
00:57:22,765 --> 00:57:27,107
they want people to do it and gradually, you know, with the win streak thing, you'll, you know,

1203
00:57:27,127 --> 00:57:29,708
if you play long enough and you're, it's a coin flip over and over again,

1204
00:57:29,728 --> 00:57:32,109
eventually you'll get enough win streaks to advance through the ranks.

1205
00:57:32,169 --> 00:57:37,872
So, yeah, I think there's definitely manipulations that you can do in there to try to keep the,

1206
00:57:38,072 --> 00:57:40,693
you know, keep the players engaged and not get too discouraged.

1207
00:57:43,129 --> 00:57:46,371
We've got about two minutes left, so I guess we can get these last two questions in.

1208
00:57:46,411 --> 00:57:47,031
Yeah, really quick.

1209
00:57:47,872 --> 00:57:54,616
So for the cube in Portals, for example, the way it was described, almost as if it was

1210
00:57:54,656 --> 00:57:58,318
like a good design for the game, actually make the game better.

1211
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:03,142
And in the talk, it seemed a lot about when you take something away, it hurts more, and

1212
00:58:03,182 --> 00:58:06,264
when you give it, it's not worth as much, so like the net gain being negative and not.

1213
00:58:07,625 --> 00:58:09,946
When is it a good game design idea to actually...

1214
00:58:10,934 --> 00:58:12,957
do the mechanic of giving something and taking it away?

1215
00:58:13,197 --> 00:58:14,760
And would you ever do it with real money?

1216
00:58:16,021 --> 00:58:16,222
Ha!

1217
00:58:17,283 --> 00:58:17,403
Um...

1218
00:58:17,543 --> 00:58:18,224
Real money games.

1219
00:58:18,385 --> 00:58:20,347
Sure there's games that do it with real money, but yeah.

1220
00:58:20,728 --> 00:58:20,808
Uh...

1221
00:58:21,469 --> 00:58:24,113
I think it depends on the effect that you're looking for in the player.

1222
00:58:24,613 --> 00:58:27,337
Like I said, when I was doing, um, a family game...

1223
00:58:28,159 --> 00:58:32,401
of which was pick crew is aimed at younger kids. I didn't want to do that. I specifically

1224
00:58:32,501 --> 00:58:35,883
soften the edges so that other people are getting instead of them losing. I don't want

1225
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:40,525
to take things away from them. But if you want that emotional beat, if you're trying

1226
00:58:40,545 --> 00:58:46,408
to get that emotional state and give the experience to the players of, you know, this is, you

1227
00:58:46,448 --> 00:58:50,109
know, that that's kind of a point in portal where it's just really obvious that.

1228
00:58:50,790 --> 00:58:52,872
something weird is going on with this computer.

1229
00:58:52,912 --> 00:58:54,393
In the beginning, the computer is your friend

1230
00:58:55,274 --> 00:58:56,455
to steal a line from paranoia,

1231
00:58:56,675 --> 00:58:59,138
and then you gradually get the feeling

1232
00:58:59,158 --> 00:59:00,379
that things are not what they seem.

1233
00:59:00,599 --> 00:59:01,680
And so it's an important.

1234
00:59:02,384 --> 00:59:07,429
point to get across really clearly that hey, you know, this is not something that's looking

1235
00:59:07,489 --> 00:59:12,113
out for your best interest. So I think that that's why it's important in that. Interestingly,

1236
00:59:12,233 --> 00:59:18,018
the developers, the reason that they kind of did it, it wasn't, although it wasn't initially

1237
00:59:18,198 --> 00:59:21,721
as an emotional thing, they just, the problem initially they had was players kept forgetting

1238
00:59:21,761 --> 00:59:25,945
to bring the cube with them. And they would get into all these weird spots and they just,

1239
00:59:26,005 --> 00:59:27,467
they were looking for a way to.

1240
00:59:28,567 --> 00:59:30,630
get the players to remember to get the cube.

1241
00:59:30,690 --> 00:59:31,831
So they put the hearts on it,

1242
00:59:31,871 --> 00:59:33,333
and first they had the computer say,

1243
00:59:33,353 --> 00:59:34,014
make sure you remember,

1244
00:59:34,034 --> 00:59:35,616
and periodically to the level say, make sure you remember.

1245
00:59:35,656 --> 00:59:36,998
And they just kept ramping it up

1246
00:59:37,058 --> 00:59:39,221
until they crossed this threshold

1247
00:59:39,261 --> 00:59:40,984
where it stopped just being reminders

1248
00:59:41,124 --> 00:59:43,968
and created a true emotional attachment to it.

1249
00:59:44,629 --> 00:59:44,849
Thank you.

1250
00:59:46,505 --> 00:59:52,231
So I've been thinking a lot about the relationship between player loss aversion and wanting to

1251
00:59:52,291 --> 00:59:54,293
reward players and give them reward mechanics.

1252
00:59:55,394 --> 01:00:00,339
There's a free to play game that has a reward wheel, and so it's like, hey, every day if

1253
01:00:00,359 --> 01:00:01,901
you come and play, you can get a reward.

1254
01:00:02,822 --> 01:00:05,805
and most of the things in the reward wheel are tiny

1255
01:00:05,905 --> 01:00:07,287
and some of them are really awesome,

1256
01:00:07,628 --> 01:00:09,330
so you keep coming back to want to spin the wheel

1257
01:00:09,390 --> 01:00:10,691
to get the awesome thing,

1258
01:00:11,813 --> 01:00:12,954
but they kind of mess it up

1259
01:00:13,094 --> 01:00:15,718
because they give everybody an equal slot,

1260
01:00:15,998 --> 01:00:16,839
size on the wheel.

1261
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:18,260
But the wheel's rigged.

1262
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:20,301
Like, clearly you don't have a one in six chance

1263
01:00:20,321 --> 01:00:21,322
of winning the awesome thing.

1264
01:00:21,742 --> 01:00:23,824
And in fact, that's telegraphed by the fact

1265
01:00:23,864 --> 01:00:26,685
that you spin the wheel and it will like zoom past

1266
01:00:26,785 --> 01:00:28,867
the expensive thing and then slow down and stop.

1267
01:00:28,907 --> 01:00:31,788
And so it rotates in this way that makes it really obvious,

1268
01:00:32,429 --> 01:00:35,510
I don't think on purpose, to the player

1269
01:00:35,610 --> 01:00:37,051
that they're being messed with.

1270
01:00:38,512 --> 01:00:44,474
And so even though I only get a benefit from spinning the wheel every day, it's my least favorite part of the game.

1271
01:00:45,474 --> 01:00:46,935
There's a bunch of other really good mechanics.

1272
01:00:47,795 --> 01:00:51,637
So I'm experiencing loss aversion for something that I don't even have

1273
01:00:52,297 --> 01:00:55,918
because I have the perceived value being equal because of the way it's represented

1274
01:00:55,938 --> 01:00:58,279
and then I'm having that taken away because I know better.

1275
01:00:59,479 --> 01:01:04,961
They could have fixed that by either giving the more expensive things a smaller slot

1276
01:01:04,981 --> 01:01:06,962
so that I perceive my chances smaller.

1277
01:01:07,502 --> 01:01:12,266
or by really hiding the fact that it can't come up so that I just feel unlucky.

1278
01:01:12,326 --> 01:01:17,390
I mean, I would hate that less than knowing that I'm being manipulated in the way that it does.

1279
01:01:19,132 --> 01:01:23,435
That's a little harder in board games because you can't hide it as well, right?

1280
01:01:23,776 --> 01:01:28,559
Like, you can't have a wheel that spins that actually calculates where it's going to end up

1281
01:01:28,579 --> 01:01:30,641
and then gives an even spin and makes it feel natural.

1282
01:01:32,182 --> 01:01:36,344
If you want to reward players with a variable reward in a board game,

1283
01:01:36,724 --> 01:01:39,726
how would you do it without making them feel bad?

1284
01:01:41,106 --> 01:01:43,908
It's a lot harder to do because, like you say,

1285
01:01:43,968 --> 01:01:46,229
the problem with a board game is everything is there.

1286
01:01:46,689 --> 01:01:49,630
And even in a legacy game, you know the packets are available

1287
01:01:49,650 --> 01:01:50,751
and what you need to do to get there.

1288
01:01:50,791 --> 01:01:53,452
So there's not really true, true, totally hidden content.

1289
01:01:53,492 --> 01:01:55,493
So it is challenging to do.

1290
01:01:55,593 --> 01:01:57,694
I'm not sure off the top of my head of how you would do it.

1291
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:01,020
you know, that other mechanic you're talking about

1292
01:02:01,060 --> 01:02:02,521
is interesting, in fact, slot machines,

1293
01:02:03,181 --> 01:02:05,683
I had a slot machine designer on our podcast

1294
01:02:05,703 --> 01:02:07,464
a couple months ago, and we talked about this,

1295
01:02:07,524 --> 01:02:10,765
and they map on the video slots, you know,

1296
01:02:10,805 --> 01:02:13,967
they decide what the final thing is gonna be at the end.

1297
01:02:15,207 --> 01:02:17,468
Before everything starts animating.

1298
01:02:17,988 --> 01:02:20,230
And they specifically program in the near miss.

1299
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:24,131
They program in so that right off the line that scores,

1300
01:02:24,231 --> 01:02:25,892
you see the winning thing,

1301
01:02:26,372 --> 01:02:28,373
which is a very powerful psychological ploy,

1302
01:02:28,413 --> 01:02:29,834
which actually starting to get outlawed now.

1303
01:02:29,874 --> 01:02:31,215
There's some jurisdictions are not allowed

1304
01:02:31,235 --> 01:02:32,115
to do that in slot machines.

1305
01:02:32,175 --> 01:02:33,936
So yeah, there's ways to do that

1306
01:02:33,956 --> 01:02:34,916
that are better than others

1307
01:02:34,936 --> 01:02:36,457
that won't piss off the players.

1308
01:02:37,458 --> 01:02:38,338
If there's any other questions,

1309
01:02:38,498 --> 01:02:39,639
I will be around afterwards,

1310
01:02:39,739 --> 01:02:41,159
but thank you so much for your attention.

1311
01:02:41,179 --> 01:02:42,020
Really appreciate it.
