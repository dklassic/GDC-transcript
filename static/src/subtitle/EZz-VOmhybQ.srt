00:00:06,181 --> 00:00:16,133
Hi, I'm Laura Higgins. I'm the Director of Community Safety and Digital Civility at Roblox. I'd like to welcome you to our panel. Thank you so much for joining us today.

2
00:00:16,153 --> 00:00:23,642
I'm going to be moderating this incredible panel discussion today. We're going to be focusing on creating inclusive content.

3
00:00:25,587 --> 00:00:31,291
So at Roblox our mission is to build a platform that enables billions of users to share experiences together.

4
00:00:31,971 --> 00:00:37,395
The Roblox concept of a platform of shared experiences is sometimes referred to as the metaverse.

5
00:00:37,415 --> 00:00:39,097
We're going to talk a little bit about that later.

6
00:00:39,477 --> 00:00:45,041
But essentially it's about creating these persistent shared 3D virtual spaces in a virtual universe.

7
00:00:46,402 --> 00:00:50,605
Roblox really is a new way for people to be together when we can't be together in person.

8
00:00:50,765 --> 00:00:56,770
It's a global community of people coming together to share experiences and every day millions of

9
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:01,813
people come together to create, connect and explore millions of immersive virtual experiences together,

10
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:08,058
all of which are created by the Roblox community. Having a healthy, diverse and positive community

11
00:01:08,078 --> 00:01:13,682
is everything to us and encouraging our developers to be mindful when they're making those experiences.

12
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,894
to make sure that the platform is safe and welcoming to everybody.

13
00:01:17,914 --> 00:01:21,579
I'm really pleased to be talking about this topic today.

14
00:01:21,619 --> 00:01:23,481
It's something personally really important to me

15
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:28,187
and I know that it means an awful lot to the people who are using our platform.

16
00:01:28,267 --> 00:01:32,412
So, you know, I'm really looking forward to having a deep conversation about this

17
00:01:32,452 --> 00:01:33,533
and going into a little bit more.

18
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:41,455
information, sorry, into a bit more depth about this topic. So without further ado, I would like

19
00:01:41,495 --> 00:01:48,116
to introduce the panel. So I'm going to hand over to Annette, please could you introduce yourself?

20
00:01:48,136 --> 00:01:54,757
Hi, sure, happy to be here. I'm the founder and CEO of Toyah, an Israeli female-led studio.

21
00:01:55,337 --> 00:02:01,599
So we're based in Tel Aviv but have a multinational team and we focus on creating equal realms and

22
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:03,639
gaming experiences for girls and boys.

23
00:02:04,267 --> 00:02:09,154
and we do that on Roblox. We have a couple of games released over the past two years

24
00:02:09,955 --> 00:02:15,323
and six weeks ago we launched the first adaptation for the animated series Miraculous Ladybug.

25
00:02:17,994 --> 00:02:22,257
Amazing. Thanks, Annette. And can I hand over to you, Robin? Could you introduce yourself?

26
00:02:22,978 --> 00:02:28,982
Yeah, sure. My name is Robin Haneke. I'm the co-founder and CEO of Phenomena here in San

27
00:02:29,002 --> 00:02:35,566
Francisco. We've been around for about nine years now. And we make games that we think bring joy and

28
00:02:35,606 --> 00:02:38,468
creativity to the world. And we are also working inside of Roblox now.

29
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,370
We have a small environment there called Beanstalk,

30
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,690
which is actually in Alpha,

31
00:02:43,251 --> 00:02:45,552
and are working on a few other projects inside this space

32
00:02:46,212 --> 00:02:47,273
that are currently unannounced,

33
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,553
but we're really excited about.

34
00:02:48,573 --> 00:02:51,595
I think that my other sort of life

35
00:02:52,075 --> 00:02:54,076
when I'm not a CEO of a game company

36
00:02:54,156 --> 00:02:56,177
is that I am a professor at UC Santa Cruz,

37
00:02:56,717 --> 00:02:59,278
and I am the founding director of the Arts, Games,

38
00:02:59,338 --> 00:03:00,819
and Playable Media program there,

39
00:03:00,859 --> 00:03:03,100
which is now one of the fastest growing majors on campus.

40
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,942
So I'm an advocate for young people making games,

41
00:03:06,042 --> 00:03:08,263
and it's one of the reasons why I find Roblox so exciting.

42
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:16,754
Amazing, thanks Robin. And finally, last but not least, Ashley, would you mind introducing yourself please?

43
00:03:17,935 --> 00:03:24,119
Hi, my name is Ashley and I've been creating on this platform for about six years now, since

44
00:03:24,179 --> 00:03:32,405
I was 11, and I focus on making various games and avatar items with my girlfriend Nicole.

45
00:03:33,245 --> 00:03:37,208
We've started a business called Tail Swipe LLC not too long ago.

46
00:03:37,944 --> 00:03:41,105
I'm planning on registering it next year.

47
00:03:42,746 --> 00:03:45,828
Focus on creating opportunities for more neurodiverse

48
00:03:45,968 --> 00:03:48,409
and disabled individuals such as myself

49
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:52,391
and serving as a departure from harmful practices

50
00:03:52,471 --> 00:03:54,492
made in traditional industry spaces.

51
00:03:55,192 --> 00:03:58,974
One of the projects we're working on under this name

52
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:01,956
is a large-scale LGBT social space.

53
00:04:09,886 --> 00:04:16,590
That's wonderful. Thank you so much, Ashley. I'm really looking forward to getting into conversation with each of you about these projects.

54
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:24,634
So let's talk a little bit about what we mean by inclusive content. So what do we really mean by that?

55
00:04:24,994 --> 00:04:29,377
I think perhaps if I can throw it out to each of you just to kind of give me a bit of feedback.

56
00:04:29,417 --> 00:04:35,060
When we say inclusive content, what does that mean to you? How about let's throw it to you this time, Robin, you go first.

57
00:04:36,552 --> 00:04:41,775
I think at Phenomena we sort of define the idea of inclusivity as coming from the imagination

58
00:04:41,796 --> 00:04:44,798
of as many people from the different walks of life as possible.

59
00:04:44,878 --> 00:04:47,300
So actually it starts with where the content comes from.

60
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,985
You know, at the company we're over 60% people who identify as coming from an underrepresented

61
00:04:54,025 --> 00:04:54,225
group.

62
00:04:54,705 --> 00:04:59,709
So, you know, have tried to really build an environment where inclusivity is part of the

63
00:04:59,809 --> 00:05:02,451
everyday concern of the people that are creating the content.

64
00:05:03,231 --> 00:05:13,176
And I think that when you get to some place where you can have open conversations about what a broad group of people want, then you're getting closer to building spaces that don't inadvertently exclude others.

65
00:05:14,417 --> 00:05:19,720
Lovely. Ashley, what does inclusive content mean to you? Do you have a kind of definition for that?

66
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,221
Yeah, to me it's...

67
00:05:22,981 --> 00:05:30,086
means sort of a body of experience, not just included various often overlooked minorities

68
00:05:30,146 --> 00:05:35,269
in the forefront of your projects, but something more nuanced as well, putting thought into how

69
00:05:35,409 --> 00:05:41,233
others of these various groups will interact with your content as well, and being sure to consider

70
00:05:41,253 --> 00:05:47,277
these different perspectives. Inclusive content should strive to make different people from all

71
00:05:47,297 --> 00:05:50,519
walks of life comfortable to explore and interact with what you've created.

72
00:05:52,267 --> 00:05:55,208
Brilliant, lovely. Anna, is there anything you can add to that?

73
00:05:55,908 --> 00:06:00,730
Not sure actually, but just you know to say that I think that inclusion actually can mean

74
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:08,033
different things to different people. So, at Toya I think that you know our mission is connected to

75
00:06:08,093 --> 00:06:15,056
creating greater inclusion for girls and women and we think that Roblox is the best place to do that

76
00:06:15,356 --> 00:06:21,358
and what it means is that when we discuss the game design we would say she and not just he.

77
00:06:22,091 --> 00:06:25,173
most of the time when describing the end user.

78
00:06:25,814 --> 00:06:29,857
So sometimes it may sound like an insignificant nuance,

79
00:06:29,937 --> 00:06:33,200
but language, I think, is the foundation of the world

80
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,783
when building and when using inclusive terminology

81
00:06:37,944 --> 00:06:40,206
while developing a game is reflected

82
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:42,187
not only within the organization,

83
00:06:42,267 --> 00:06:44,729
but also in the final game.

84
00:06:44,809 --> 00:06:45,630
So yes.

85
00:06:47,712 --> 00:06:48,492
Brilliant, thank you.

86
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:54,050
Is there anything that you're particularly focusing on within your work that's related to this topic?

87
00:06:55,192 --> 00:07:00,723
Robin, you're nodding, what are you doing? Yeah, so I actually have a mug here.

88
00:07:01,268 --> 00:07:02,690
for a game that we made called Luna.

89
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,152
And in Luna, we made the game is a fairy tale.

90
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:07,274
It's all about different animals.

91
00:07:07,695 --> 00:07:10,197
And it's actually a game about recovering from trauma.

92
00:07:10,237 --> 00:07:12,679
So the sort of core narrative is about letting go

93
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:14,241
of something that's a traumatic experience

94
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:16,543
and letting yourself move past something

95
00:07:16,563 --> 00:07:18,485
that maybe you're carrying around in your tummy

96
00:07:18,505 --> 00:07:19,526
is kind of the analogy.

97
00:07:20,147 --> 00:07:21,848
But when we were working on the game,

98
00:07:22,249 --> 00:07:23,330
we removed all...

99
00:07:24,315 --> 00:07:29,660
gender pronouns from the concept so that no one was ever talking about any of the characters

100
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:35,765
specifically in a gendered way and made it so that you could identify with any of the animals in the

101
00:07:35,966 --> 00:07:42,411
in the game as you or as someone you know as a way of kind of creating more of a of a dialogue

102
00:07:42,571 --> 00:07:47,215
around personal narrative and being able to project your personal narrative in the space

103
00:07:47,856 --> 00:07:51,759
and since then I've really been sort of focusing a lot on how

104
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:57,586
across games like Journey and then Luna, even with Tom, the ideas of the characters are really

105
00:07:57,646 --> 00:08:02,271
informed by this idea that you're not necessarily gendering them in your mind when you're making

106
00:08:02,311 --> 00:08:07,057
them. And in my next game, I'm trying to see if I can build a really truly diverse and interesting

107
00:08:07,097 --> 00:08:10,661
environment where there's a single body type that you change.

108
00:08:11,822 --> 00:08:14,585
by how you dress it and how it performs in the space,

109
00:08:14,965 --> 00:08:18,368
as opposed to the sort of core components of it.

110
00:08:18,448 --> 00:08:20,429
So basically like the Sims 1,

111
00:08:20,489 --> 00:08:21,870
building an entire experience

112
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:24,032
on a single set of animated properties.

113
00:08:24,072 --> 00:08:25,894
So that's actually one of the big experiments

114
00:08:25,914 --> 00:08:26,634
I'm working on right now.

115
00:08:27,115 --> 00:08:28,716
That sounds really fascinating, Robin.

116
00:08:28,836 --> 00:08:29,316
Well, we'll see.

117
00:08:29,537 --> 00:08:32,639
And Anas, is there anything that's like really focusing you

118
00:08:32,819 --> 00:08:35,081
on this project at the moment, on this topic at the moment?

119
00:08:35,957 --> 00:08:40,980
And I think that, you know, with one of our original games, like My Farm on Roblox,

120
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:48,685
like we aspired to many and varied representations of farms. So from Asia and Africa and different

121
00:08:48,745 --> 00:08:53,589
countries in Europe, like Spain and Germany. And we wanted everyone to be able to choose

122
00:08:53,669 --> 00:08:59,653
the style of their farm from a wide and representative range and manifest their

123
00:08:59,693 --> 00:09:01,754
personality in a manner that is free.

124
00:09:02,296 --> 00:09:05,758
from traditional and a chronistic representations of farm.

125
00:09:06,439 --> 00:09:09,961
And the other thing we did was to include NPCs

126
00:09:10,001 --> 00:09:13,604
of female farmers because looking at other farm

127
00:09:13,984 --> 00:09:17,826
genre games on Roblox, we just saw male farmers

128
00:09:17,886 --> 00:09:18,607
all over the place.

129
00:09:18,687 --> 00:09:20,828
And so we thought that this experiences

130
00:09:21,189 --> 00:09:23,610
would reflect different cultures and nationalities

131
00:09:24,171 --> 00:09:27,073
which go beyond the American centric representation.

132
00:09:27,253 --> 00:09:31,035
And so this is what we were doing on with my farm.

133
00:09:33,898 --> 00:09:42,207
Ashley, so I know you've been creating things within Roblox for some time, so can you tell us a little bit about how you're thinking about inclusivity and what you're focusing on right now?

134
00:09:44,069 --> 00:09:57,162
Well, my focus relating to this is simple, providing representation from marginalised and often overlooked groups, curating opportunities and spaces for us to thrive and aiding and gradually shifting both online spaces and

135
00:09:57,936 --> 00:10:01,997
the general development workflow to be much more mindful of these issues,

136
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:06,299
all things that are extremely important, but on the same token, what we're often

137
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,840
pride of. Growing up in plenty of these

138
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,321
environments have really served to make this the forefront of my focus in the

139
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:16,243
industry. I know how devastating it was for me to

140
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:18,503
not have these various considerations widespread,

141
00:10:19,304 --> 00:10:23,005
and I seek to do everything I can to make sure these issues don't hold true

142
00:10:23,045 --> 00:10:24,586
with other individuals as well.

143
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:35,072
Continuing with Robin's definition of, I think, a trauma-focused game, my first series developed,

144
00:10:35,413 --> 00:10:41,898
albeit a never fully realized project, was Consomnio, which was a story game to express

145
00:10:41,918 --> 00:10:48,122
a lot of the struggles I've been through realizing my trans identity while traversing an extremely

146
00:10:48,182 --> 00:10:53,846
negative environment at home and otherwise. I plan to continue work on it in the coming years,

147
00:10:54,027 --> 00:10:55,668
this being one of my larger passions.

148
00:10:56,185 --> 00:11:01,733
developing experiences, hopefully resonating and helping LGBT youth who've gone through similar situations.

149
00:11:05,025 --> 00:11:17,187
Fantastic, thank you. Yeah, I mean, all of those things are so important and we've already touched on so many different themes about, you know, inclusion and representation. So I'm really looking forward to digging into some of those ideas a bit more.

150
00:11:18,547 --> 00:11:24,288
So as I say, during this session, you know, we're going to explore what good representation looks like, why it is so important,

151
00:11:24,848 --> 00:11:32,810
and sometimes why it's really hard. You know, we've already touched on some huge topics there. We all want to make sure that these spaces feel safe and welcoming.

152
00:11:33,738 --> 00:11:38,060
and that when people join places like the Metaverse and online spaces that they're having a good time.

153
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,844
So you know I mentioned the Metaverse before, what does it really mean? I mean as I say it's a term

154
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:48,586
coined in science fiction originally, it's now been used for decades but we're only really starting to

155
00:11:48,646 --> 00:11:54,249
see it become a real thing now in the online world and particularly within platforms like

156
00:11:54,289 --> 00:11:59,792
Wayblock. So in essence these 3D online spaces are where people can seamlessly move from one

157
00:11:59,832 --> 00:12:00,813
experience to another.

158
00:12:01,452 --> 00:12:04,815
taking their online avatar and identity with them,

159
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,037
quite often taking their friends with them

160
00:12:07,077 --> 00:12:09,419
and going through all these experiences

161
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,461
through entertainment like concerts

162
00:12:11,561 --> 00:12:14,043
and art galleries and fashion shows.

163
00:12:14,624 --> 00:12:16,966
They can do learning, they can do work in these spaces,

164
00:12:17,026 --> 00:12:17,907
all in one platform.

165
00:12:18,367 --> 00:12:20,990
So really what we're doing is replicating the real world,

166
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,071
but now online.

167
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:27,808
providing spaces like that that are really inclusive, we have to think way beyond safety.

168
00:12:28,368 --> 00:12:31,629
Of course that's absolutely essential and that should be the first thing we think about

169
00:12:32,069 --> 00:12:36,130
but then it's about building these other things around it. We want to make sure that every member

170
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:41,892
of the community feels they belong, they have equity and that they're represented. We all know

171
00:12:42,273 --> 00:12:47,634
if you don't see it you can't be it. So you know I think what happens online is a real reflection

172
00:12:47,654 --> 00:12:48,275
of what's going on.

173
00:12:48,788 --> 00:12:54,331
offline and we are all facing huge societal issues right now that perhaps have become far more

174
00:12:54,371 --> 00:12:59,014
prevalent than before. How do we start to address them? So I think we're going to dig into some of

175
00:12:59,054 --> 00:13:09,761
these really big topics now. So what do we really mean? Is it enough, sorry, to just translate

176
00:13:09,801 --> 00:13:15,064
languages, to provide language support for different regions? How do we really make these

177
00:13:15,104 --> 00:13:17,746
games totally globally inclusive?

178
00:13:18,787 --> 00:13:20,174
I'm going to hand that over to Annette.

179
00:13:22,586 --> 00:13:28,188
And I think that it starts for me with the team.

180
00:13:28,948 --> 00:13:34,169
So who's on my team that can think, not who are they?

181
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:35,530
Who do they represent?

182
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:40,611
Cause this would definitely translate to the experience

183
00:13:40,651 --> 00:13:42,091
they will be looking to create.

184
00:13:42,792 --> 00:13:45,012
And we know that the games industry have been like

185
00:13:45,592 --> 00:13:49,654
dominated by a very male centric perspective

186
00:13:49,714 --> 00:13:50,854
for a long, long time.

187
00:13:51,374 --> 00:13:56,357
And I think that one of the key metrics to changing that

188
00:13:56,678 --> 00:14:00,080
is comprising a team that has different age

189
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,083
group that represent different personalities, nationalities,

190
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:09,306
genders in a way that will translate into the experience

191
00:14:09,927 --> 00:14:10,987
you're looking to create.

192
00:14:11,207 --> 00:14:14,670
I have no doubt, because I've seen it happening in Toya.

193
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,572
Once you have a discussion and a brainstorm around the game,

194
00:14:18,012 --> 00:14:19,873
and everyone can bring in their own.

195
00:14:20,686 --> 00:14:27,053
a culture and personal experience, this will reflect and the experience you will be looking

196
00:14:27,113 --> 00:14:35,162
to create. So, and it will almost become like a non-issue. Once this is like something you're

197
00:14:35,202 --> 00:14:40,368
accustomed in doing within your team and the discussions, really it does, it becomes a non-issue.

198
00:14:45,688 --> 00:14:48,089
Yeah, thank you, Annette. That's really fantastic.

199
00:14:48,229 --> 00:14:51,150
And, you know, I think that's something we can really think about, isn't it?

200
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:54,491
Is just getting those shared ideas right from the beginning,

201
00:14:54,511 --> 00:14:56,851
right from conception is really, really important.

202
00:14:56,951 --> 00:15:01,212
So we know there have been quite a lot of trends and developments

203
00:15:01,252 --> 00:15:05,353
in the gaming space all around diverse communities and creating inclusive content.

204
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:09,194
What do you think game designers and developers should keep in mind

205
00:15:09,334 --> 00:15:12,795
when they're coming up with these new games or content

206
00:15:12,975 --> 00:15:15,015
or virtual items as you create Ashley?

207
00:15:15,955 --> 00:15:17,135
I'm going to start with you, Robin.

208
00:15:17,155 --> 00:15:18,216
Could you kick this one off, please?

209
00:15:19,296 --> 00:15:21,217
Yeah, I mean, I think that what we've

210
00:15:21,238 --> 00:15:23,979
been sort of talking about in general

211
00:15:24,099 --> 00:15:25,740
is true in the specific as well, right?

212
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:28,141
So vocabulary, figuring out how you're

213
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:30,762
going to talk about the kinds of mechanisms

214
00:15:30,782 --> 00:15:31,483
that are in your game.

215
00:15:31,543 --> 00:15:35,625
So for example, we built a game that was a tower defense title.

216
00:15:36,205 --> 00:15:38,186
And tower defense is a genre.

217
00:15:38,607 --> 00:15:41,368
And tower defense is like you put a tower down,

218
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:41,888
and then you.

219
00:15:42,449 --> 00:15:47,953
you know, you defend your territory against enemies, right? And looking at the genre itself,

220
00:15:48,033 --> 00:15:51,995
you know, the team was really asking, what does it mean to just go someplace and put your stuff

221
00:15:52,015 --> 00:15:56,179
down and then take and take and take? Like, how do you decolonialize this narrative?

222
00:15:56,579 --> 00:16:00,201
How do you make it, you know, not racist? How do you make it inclusive?

223
00:16:00,682 --> 00:16:17,696
What's the kind of backstory for an environment and a game world where people could feel included by participating in this in this relatively, you know, command and conquer style gameplay that's been a hobbyist game genre since the beginning of games right when you look at actually developing.

224
00:16:18,773 --> 00:16:21,175
your games and looking at what genres are popular,

225
00:16:21,476 --> 00:16:23,378
you have to kind of do a little bit of unpacking

226
00:16:23,418 --> 00:16:25,800
about the history of where these games come from.

227
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,123
And most often they come from the military history

228
00:16:28,543 --> 00:16:30,365
and they come from a place where the people

229
00:16:30,405 --> 00:16:32,548
that were making them had access to computers

230
00:16:32,608 --> 00:16:34,750
because they were in the military industrial complex.

231
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:38,972
So just actually starting there with the definition of the genre.

232
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:42,634
And then the other thing that we always try to do is think about what the user experience is

233
00:16:42,674 --> 00:16:47,296
that we really want. If you want to build a game that creates a feeling of joy or creativity,

234
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:52,138
or in the case of Luna, a sense of letting go, then you really need to build that into every

235
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,701
actual aspect of the game. So if at the beginning of the game, you're solving a puzzle,

236
00:16:57,221 --> 00:17:00,903
and then you're building out a world, and then you're going into that world to engage with the

237
00:17:00,923 --> 00:17:01,403
characters,

238
00:17:01,914 --> 00:17:05,476
You know, if everything leads to a moment where you're helping a piece of,

239
00:17:06,196 --> 00:17:10,978
of trauma, escape a character and go into the sky and become part of the moon,

240
00:17:10,998 --> 00:17:12,059
you know, that's the narrative that came,

241
00:17:12,479 --> 00:17:15,981
then you really have to be focusing all of your energy on that transformative

242
00:17:16,021 --> 00:17:20,123
moment of letting go. It's going to be at the end of every chapter.

243
00:17:20,183 --> 00:17:22,944
And so really building the development beats around.

244
00:17:23,489 --> 00:17:29,711
a shared language that takes away kind of notions of privilege or control, authority and so on,

245
00:17:30,352 --> 00:17:35,894
and then also building towards something that's different. And I think that, you know, this is,

246
00:17:36,335 --> 00:17:41,157
it happens on a team, but it happens because you make it part of the process. So you have to build

247
00:17:41,197 --> 00:17:42,738
a team where people feel comfortable saying,

248
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:44,430
I don't really like this.

249
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:48,353
This is a little bit like this example film

250
00:17:48,373 --> 00:17:51,376
that we're using, for example, for inspiration in the boards

251
00:17:52,076 --> 00:17:55,899
is really whitewashed version of an Asian narrative.

252
00:17:56,379 --> 00:17:57,780
All the characters in the film were white.

253
00:17:58,081 --> 00:18:00,422
I feel uncomfortable about that as an Asian-American person

254
00:18:00,462 --> 00:18:00,883
or whatever.

255
00:18:01,263 --> 00:18:02,704
You need to build an environment where people

256
00:18:02,724 --> 00:18:04,045
feel safe to say those things.

257
00:18:04,105 --> 00:18:08,288
And I think what Anat and Ashley have talked about already

258
00:18:08,348 --> 00:18:10,690
is really about building an experience for people,

259
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,751
but it comes from the people themselves.

260
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:17,578
Yeah, no, fantastic. And I think having that healthy challenge from the people around you,

261
00:18:17,598 --> 00:18:21,880
that's why we hire these people. Exactly. Creative abrasion. It's a good thing.

262
00:18:22,061 --> 00:18:23,341
Absolutely. Absolutely.

263
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:32,344
identify with what Robin just said. I think it's about redefining culture to some extent.

264
00:18:32,905 --> 00:18:39,509
I can give an example of a discussion we had a while ago with a Christmas update we wanted to

265
00:18:39,569 --> 00:18:45,953
have in one of our games and we were starting talking about Santa Claus and his wife and

266
00:18:45,973 --> 00:18:46,813
we're like Israelis.

267
00:18:47,527 --> 00:18:52,070
It does not apply to us so and then we have like European

268
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:55,072
members in the team and so it does not apply to them as well

269
00:18:55,672 --> 00:18:59,655
and so all kinds of winter math came up and we started like it

270
00:18:59,695 --> 00:19:03,197
was like an incredible discussion where they were

271
00:19:03,257 --> 00:19:08,440
sharing a lot of you know their historical childhood stories and

272
00:19:08,701 --> 00:19:11,182
by the end of the day this was all manifested into the

273
00:19:11,242 --> 00:19:12,963
Christmas update in a really.

274
00:19:13,464 --> 00:19:16,045
I think spectacular way, cause it was like.

275
00:19:16,486 --> 00:19:23,711
representing different lifestyles and myths

276
00:19:24,131 --> 00:19:25,913
that is for me,

277
00:19:26,753 --> 00:19:29,496
expanding the experience of Christmas

278
00:19:30,096 --> 00:19:31,517
and the specific update.

279
00:19:31,557 --> 00:19:33,318
So it was like a win-win for me,

280
00:19:33,479 --> 00:19:36,281
like from all aspects, I would say, yes.

281
00:19:37,247 --> 00:19:41,569
Absolutely and we can all keep learning and these things as well you know I think for us it's there's

282
00:19:41,609 --> 00:19:46,112
a moment of growth there it's really interesting. So we've kind of talked about advice for the

283
00:19:46,172 --> 00:19:53,616
developers or the creators here but what about the community? How do we create these communities that

284
00:19:53,676 --> 00:20:01,440
support the diversity? How can we really showcase that work in general? How do we get it out there?

285
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:06,302
How do we get people acceptant of this kind of change in the way that we want to create things?

286
00:20:06,792 --> 00:20:08,195
Anna, do you want to go first on this one?

287
00:20:09,677 --> 00:20:11,379
I think that, yeah, happy to.

288
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,244
I think that one of the keys to being

289
00:20:14,364 --> 00:20:17,809
able to support diverse contributors

290
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:20,273
is to make sure the community you're building

291
00:20:20,433 --> 00:20:21,295
is a safe space.

292
00:20:22,239 --> 00:20:28,760
So we take extra care towards minorities to ensure that their needs are met. Members who do not

293
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:36,502
support minorities or who are disrespectful are swiftly removed from our community and we ensure

294
00:20:36,562 --> 00:20:43,183
that we have admins who are approachable and able to help anyone who has issues. And there are like

295
00:20:43,363 --> 00:20:47,984
I think many ways to make everyone feel welcome.

296
00:20:49,985 --> 00:20:53,927
Some tips I can share are like, you know, have clear rules,

297
00:20:53,947 --> 00:20:56,769
including a banning or blocking system

298
00:20:57,269 --> 00:21:00,611
and encourage people to express any aspects of their lives

299
00:21:00,832 --> 00:21:02,493
that they wish to express.

300
00:21:03,213 --> 00:21:06,575
And ensuring that your admin teams contains

301
00:21:06,595 --> 00:21:08,176
a diverse group of people

302
00:21:08,636 --> 00:21:12,139
can also really help everyone feel welcome.

303
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:14,880
So I think that once the community

304
00:21:15,349 --> 00:21:21,991
feels safe and welcoming and it's demonstrated that diverse people are welcome, it becomes easier

305
00:21:22,611 --> 00:21:29,333
to start highlighting their own work. So yes, this is how we approach it with TOIA.

306
00:21:30,054 --> 00:21:33,215
Brilliant, thank you. Robin, did you have anything to add on that topic?

307
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:48,120
Yeah, I actually think that like my experience building journey was was really educational here, trying to build an online space where two people would be interacting with one another, but you would not have any idea of their gender their age where they

308
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:48,741
were playing from.

309
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:55,312
by removing all the player data so that they were just an anonymous being. You know, a lot of people

310
00:21:55,332 --> 00:21:58,815
had the experience of playing Journey where they thought that that character was an AI

311
00:21:58,835 --> 00:22:03,879
and didn't realize they were playing with multiple people over a period of levels and then at the

312
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:08,103
end of the game were really blown away by the sort of screen that showed how many partners you had

313
00:22:08,143 --> 00:22:14,709
played with. And it really showed me a couple of things. The first few things were really about

314
00:22:15,409 --> 00:22:21,292
Structurally, how you build the design of a game, especially how you build communication systems

315
00:22:21,352 --> 00:22:28,456
inside a game, has a huge impact on the tone of the experience. So if you go to a house party

316
00:22:29,016 --> 00:22:33,258
at a random house that, you know, a friend of a friend says, oh, someone's having a house party,

317
00:22:33,678 --> 00:22:38,601
you go, you show up, there's a ton of anxiety around who's going to be at the party, am I

318
00:22:38,641 --> 00:22:39,621
dressed appropriately?

319
00:22:40,062 --> 00:22:43,064
You know, are there going to be activities at the party that I want to do?

320
00:22:43,104 --> 00:22:46,506
Are there going to be things there that I don't like, like lots of illegal drugs

321
00:22:46,606 --> 00:22:48,668
or a ton of dancing, which makes me anxious, right?

322
00:22:48,748 --> 00:22:51,630
And like putting yourself in that situation is a huge

323
00:22:52,311 --> 00:22:55,333
it's a huge burden, especially for someone who's not neurotypical.

324
00:22:55,393 --> 00:22:58,896
And I am not so like, you know, as someone who has anxiety

325
00:22:58,936 --> 00:23:01,177
about going to public places that I don't understand

326
00:23:01,578 --> 00:23:03,779
when I think about what would make a community accessible,

327
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:07,262
it's that I can show up without being on.

328
00:23:08,002 --> 00:23:12,824
I can choose the environments that I'm in and I get to contribute when I feel comfortable.

329
00:23:12,984 --> 00:23:18,325
And like there are some really great papers, for example, Project Horseshoe has a paper on

330
00:23:18,865 --> 00:23:23,007
online relationships and the way that people develop relationships. The Sims community has

331
00:23:23,287 --> 00:23:28,748
done a lot of work in the space. There's a history of designers developing online spaces where they

332
00:23:29,148 --> 00:23:33,830
really ask, what are the levers that I have to pull right away and do I have to do it?

333
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,361
as soon as I show up do I have to perform?

334
00:23:36,441 --> 00:23:38,601
And I think asking those kinds of questions is important.

335
00:23:39,101 --> 00:23:40,001
And then the other thing is,

336
00:23:41,142 --> 00:23:43,302
again, we have built a lot of games

337
00:23:43,342 --> 00:23:44,422
that are about conquering,

338
00:23:44,442 --> 00:23:47,403
they're about being a king of the hill.

339
00:23:47,683 --> 00:23:51,424
This is like a huge genre inside of Roblox

340
00:23:51,504 --> 00:23:53,364
is the players that want to be king of the hill.

341
00:23:53,744 --> 00:23:55,384
You know, you can say queen of the hill,

342
00:23:55,724 --> 00:23:58,365
but in the end that implies a hierarchical structure

343
00:23:58,445 --> 00:23:59,805
and winners and losers

344
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:01,706
and really asking yourself for something

345
00:24:01,926 --> 00:24:03,146
like a game like Journey.

346
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:03,226
Bye.

347
00:24:03,906 --> 00:24:10,067
What's a way that I can interact with other people that implies no power, that is reciprocal

348
00:24:10,527 --> 00:24:15,848
and reciprocated at will by the other person. And so, you know, for example, I can't talk to them,

349
00:24:15,888 --> 00:24:20,669
but I can sing to them. Well, when I sing to them, they glow and they can fly. So they get a benefit

350
00:24:20,729 --> 00:24:26,030
and I get to hear a beautiful sound. Like that's a reciprocal sustaining and mutually fulfilling

351
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:29,550
relationship. I think these are the kinds of things you have to ask yourself when you're

352
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:31,411
building a community from day one.

353
00:24:32,411 --> 00:24:35,372
what are the levers and do I have to perform right away?

354
00:24:35,732 --> 00:24:37,753
Because if you throw people into these experiences,

355
00:24:37,793 --> 00:24:38,793
no matter where they come from,

356
00:24:38,813 --> 00:24:40,353
they're going to feel anxiety.

357
00:24:40,593 --> 00:24:42,014
It's going to impact their experience.

358
00:24:42,054 --> 00:24:43,834
And in the long run, it's going to make them feel less safe,

359
00:24:44,275 --> 00:24:46,435
regardless of whether you're really explicitly thinking

360
00:24:46,475 --> 00:24:49,716
about minorities, women, trans folks, queer folks,

361
00:24:49,876 --> 00:24:51,377
you know, people that are differently abled.

362
00:24:52,197 --> 00:24:54,117
Yeah, no, I totally agree with you.

363
00:24:54,177 --> 00:24:57,018
I think, yeah, all of it needs to be organic

364
00:24:57,098 --> 00:24:59,919
and a gentle process to get people in it

365
00:25:00,239 --> 00:25:01,360
to really immerse themselves.

366
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:01,540
Yeah.

367
00:25:02,112 --> 00:25:06,617
Yeah, I love that. Ashley, I'm going to come to you with a very slightly question, a slightly different question.

368
00:25:07,818 --> 00:25:13,243
So I'm thinking more about the community and the feedback that we get from the community.

369
00:25:13,263 --> 00:25:19,088
You know, is it helpful to get that feedback from the community that you're trying to reach?

370
00:25:19,709 --> 00:25:22,552
What's helped you with your Roblox community, Ashley?

371
00:25:24,318 --> 00:25:29,960
I mean, I absolutely can't stress enough how important feedback from marginalized people is.

372
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:36,642
Way too often have I seen, you know, bigger beginner creators come in both on and off the

373
00:25:36,682 --> 00:25:42,804
platform left to consider if their game's content is accessible to a wider audience,

374
00:25:43,585 --> 00:25:48,827
disabled and neurotypical individuals especially. As a direct result,

375
00:25:49,197 --> 00:25:52,678
This ends up both alienating a good portion of your audience

376
00:25:52,998 --> 00:25:55,659
and severely limiting the reach.

377
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,201
Things that could easily be figured out by both research

378
00:25:59,441 --> 00:26:01,622
and consulting and reaching out to your audience

379
00:26:01,642 --> 00:26:06,064
to make sure your content is as accessible as possible.

380
00:26:06,604 --> 00:26:10,006
There are plenty of people you can ask for feedback

381
00:26:10,046 --> 00:26:10,946
while making content.

382
00:26:11,506 --> 00:26:14,488
Those with colorblindness, low motor control,

383
00:26:14,548 --> 00:26:16,088
and neurodivergent individuals

384
00:26:16,188 --> 00:26:17,629
are all great places to start.

385
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:23,983
It's important to also remember that not everyone experiences disability the same.

386
00:26:24,603 --> 00:26:30,047
One colourblind person may have trouble seeing certain colours and another may have trouble

387
00:26:30,387 --> 00:26:35,731
distinguishing them. Everyone's unique which is why these groups are important.

388
00:26:38,172 --> 00:26:40,594
Yeah that's I mean that's such a good point and

389
00:26:41,958 --> 00:26:47,103
You know, the flip side, I guess, is that the more of these things we can do, the more we're having those conversations,

390
00:26:47,603 --> 00:26:54,990
the more we can help people who are not experiencing those things to understand that there are so many nuances that it's different for everybody.

391
00:26:55,530 --> 00:27:02,517
You know, we can all sit here and say, oh, I know what colorblindness is, but we don't unless you experience it. So just to try and have somebody

392
00:27:02,997 --> 00:27:07,678
share their personal experience with you and perhaps a variety of those experiences. I can

393
00:27:07,718 --> 00:27:12,359
see that that would be really helpful in getting people to really understand and also that

394
00:27:12,399 --> 00:27:18,881
representation topic as well. What about you guys? Do you get feedback from your communities? How

395
00:27:18,921 --> 00:27:27,263
do you manage that? Anna, I'll throw it to you first. I think that with Roblox, once you feel

396
00:27:27,283 --> 00:27:30,143
like you're the community, it means that

397
00:27:30,686 --> 00:27:37,489
you're on your way to success to the extent that you have successfully found a team that

398
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:44,153
is the community and reflects the community. But it's not just about that. I think that for us,

399
00:27:44,173 --> 00:27:51,076
it was also about successfully creating a process where the community is involved from the beginning.

400
00:27:51,817 --> 00:27:58,860
So on our Discord channel, there are like thousands of girls, boys, non-binary who are

401
00:27:59,317 --> 00:28:06,582
constantly constantly playing our games and we share every feature and every new character

402
00:28:07,062 --> 00:28:13,346
and every idea we have so on a weekly play test and then our community manager you know invites

403
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:17,189
everyone who wants to join and give their feedback and there's like a conversation

404
00:28:17,209 --> 00:28:24,093
of like sometimes two hours a week of what they think we should add and how and why and so it's

405
00:28:24,133 --> 00:28:24,274
like

406
00:28:25,434 --> 00:28:43,103
super relevant, super interesting, and a lot of that feedback has been taken back and implemented into the process, even a lot, a lot before the game is released. So I think that this is a part of, you know, working with being a part of the community, for sure.

407
00:28:44,503 --> 00:28:44,863
Brilliant.

408
00:28:45,365 --> 00:28:51,713
Now, Robin, I know that you engage with the communities because I saw you speak at our Roblox developer conference a couple of years ago.

409
00:28:51,733 --> 00:28:58,521
And I know, you know, a lot of our developers just were desperate to come and talk to you about the stuff you've been working on.

410
00:28:59,082 --> 00:29:04,068
How else do you do it outside of Roblox? How do you engage with your community and what sort of feedback do you get?

411
00:29:04,487 --> 00:29:07,648
So we have a pretty active social channel outside of Roblox.

412
00:29:08,048 --> 00:29:12,790
We get a lot of feedback from the user community and user reviews if you go to our Steam page,

413
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:17,212
especially for games like Luna, which have... They reach a certain community,

414
00:29:17,292 --> 00:29:20,393
like they're built for that community. Like Luna was not built to be a AAA

415
00:29:20,713 --> 00:29:26,015
blockbuster, it was built to be a conversation point for people that are struggling in some way

416
00:29:26,095 --> 00:29:32,338
and need a chill, kind of cool, easy place to kind of be and experience themselves and have

417
00:29:32,378 --> 00:29:33,438
some time with themselves.

418
00:29:33,999 --> 00:29:36,660
And I think we get a lot of feedback on those channels.

419
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:39,260
And I think one of the things that's really important

420
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,321
to point out is that as a developer,

421
00:29:41,361 --> 00:29:43,082
especially if you're established

422
00:29:43,122 --> 00:29:44,042
and you've been in the community,

423
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:46,443
like I've been making games for almost 20 years

424
00:29:46,503 --> 00:29:48,044
and my first product was the Sims,

425
00:29:48,604 --> 00:29:51,485
you can really get a sense of how a dialogue

426
00:29:51,505 --> 00:29:54,826
with the community about like what Anat is talking about,

427
00:29:54,906 --> 00:29:55,626
you know, like,

428
00:29:56,367 --> 00:30:00,330
about what the features are, what would you like to see, how would you like to engage with this

429
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:04,453
product as you move forward, like if you could add anything like to this expansion pack, what would

430
00:30:04,473 --> 00:30:09,317
it be? And they'll always say, oh, snow, which is of course a really difficult thing to add to a game.

431
00:30:09,337 --> 00:30:11,459
You have to add it to every asset, right? So

432
00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:25,913
You learn to have a dialogue with the community, not only about what their wishes are, but also about the development itself and it's a teaching moment like you're building within the community as you discuss with your, your players and your co creators

433
00:30:25,973 --> 00:30:31,178
you're building a sense of shared ownership, but you're also letting them know like what the limitations are what

434
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:34,840
what the prioritization schemes are, how we make decisions,

435
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,221
how development takes time.

436
00:30:37,241 --> 00:30:40,223
And as people get more educated about games

437
00:30:40,343 --> 00:30:44,405
and gaming spaces, they become more interested

438
00:30:44,505 --> 00:30:46,826
in becoming a co-creator or co-imaginer

439
00:30:47,506 --> 00:30:50,347
or like a visionary in your space.

440
00:30:50,367 --> 00:30:53,529
And you're really giving them the opportunity

441
00:30:53,569 --> 00:30:55,830
to feel involved in a way that is...

442
00:30:57,239 --> 00:31:02,983
it takes it takes it to the next level. Like they might be inspired to, to build their own space

443
00:31:03,144 --> 00:31:09,789
and Roblox or to pick up unity and try something new. And in my mind, a world where more people

444
00:31:09,829 --> 00:31:15,113
are building interactive material that expresses their own perspective is a world where more people

445
00:31:15,153 --> 00:31:18,795
can engage with others perspectives and learn what does it feel like to be differently abled

446
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:23,699
in this way or this way? What does it feel like to, to feel isolated in this body or?

447
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:30,845
to move to a new country and try to be at home by eating different foods that you miss.

448
00:31:31,065 --> 00:31:34,368
You know, like when you look at some of the content that's being released right now,

449
00:31:34,468 --> 00:31:39,372
especially in VR, there's a huge opportunity for the audience to become the creators themselves.

450
00:31:39,852 --> 00:31:43,275
And I think it's really important for us as established developers to

451
00:31:43,335 --> 00:31:45,757
engage with that and build bridges and skills.

452
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:50,173
Brilliant, thank you. And that is the perfect segue to my next question.

453
00:31:50,674 --> 00:31:54,697
We've talked a bit about what you can do as the creators yourselves.

454
00:31:55,217 --> 00:31:58,720
We've talked a little bit about bringing in those different perspectives and

455
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:01,502
those different voices from the community and getting that kind of those

456
00:32:01,542 --> 00:32:06,226
feedback links going. How, bearing in mind, you know, this is a brilliantly

457
00:32:06,266 --> 00:32:07,967
diverse panel. Yay.

458
00:32:07,987 --> 00:32:13,091
But we know even gender representation is nowhere near where it should be.

459
00:32:14,177 --> 00:32:16,438
How do we bring in these diverse communities?

460
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:19,341
How do we welcome them in so they can be those creators?

461
00:32:20,201 --> 00:32:22,703
So that we wanna get to a point where

462
00:32:23,224 --> 00:32:25,165
diverse is the normal, but it isn't there yet.

463
00:32:25,206 --> 00:32:26,967
So what do you think we can do going forward

464
00:32:27,007 --> 00:32:29,709
to make those spaces, to encourage that talent

465
00:32:29,789 --> 00:32:33,232
and that creativity, but that's in a way that people

466
00:32:33,252 --> 00:32:35,914
are kind of not being dragged into it, but are running to it.

467
00:32:36,915 --> 00:32:37,996
Anna, I'm gonna come to you first.

468
00:32:39,695 --> 00:32:47,044
And so I think for me, I'm always thinking about, OK, how can I improve recruitment for Toya?

469
00:32:47,745 --> 00:32:53,072
And posting our job descriptions and the dev forum in Roblox

470
00:32:53,592 --> 00:32:56,576
that allows every community member to apply.

471
00:32:57,314 --> 00:33:04,863
as a step forward for me and we pay a lot of attention to how we define the role and leave

472
00:33:04,903 --> 00:33:11,530
it as open as we can and as well as you know emphasize diversity and inclusion to make our

473
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:17,277
jobs feel more accessible for those who may not consider themselves eligible candidates.

474
00:33:17,957 --> 00:33:21,138
So for me, it's like, okay, so how do we make everyone,

475
00:33:21,218 --> 00:33:23,738
even the ones that they so want to apply,

476
00:33:23,798 --> 00:33:26,959
but they won't unless we really facilitate this.

477
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:30,660
So let's give it another thought and make it accessible

478
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,861
for everyone who can be a brilliant game designer,

479
00:33:33,901 --> 00:33:35,661
but is not on our team yet.

480
00:33:35,761 --> 00:33:40,302
So this is something I'm focusing on all the time

481
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:41,562
when recruiting, yes.

482
00:33:43,007 --> 00:33:53,974
Thank you. Ashley, I think, you know, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this, but also thinking about, you know, that slightly younger audience that you're probably looking for within Roblox.

483
00:33:54,794 --> 00:34:04,340
What do you think really works for them, for, you know, kind of underrepresented groups within the youth sector? What do you think is engaging with them?

484
00:34:06,082 --> 00:34:12,686
I mean, well, the biggest way to get someone to participate is actually making them feel as though they're invited.

485
00:34:13,579 --> 00:34:22,624
I'm not an outlier or a second thought when it comes to both developing projects and pushing the development environment on aspiring creators.

486
00:34:23,344 --> 00:34:34,290
We often lose people from the latter, either hostile development, or one that doesn't care to consider or accommodate for issues of people like us trying to get into the space.

487
00:34:35,171 --> 00:34:41,254
As I mentioned earlier, there are plenty of harmful practices made in the game development industry, making it

488
00:34:41,809 --> 00:34:46,954
especially possible for neurodiverse and disabled individuals get pretty far,

489
00:34:47,455 --> 00:34:50,819
something that can often be remedied with basic consideration.

490
00:34:51,944 --> 00:34:52,945
Brilliant, thank you.

491
00:34:53,846 --> 00:34:57,269
I would just like to add, yeah, I was just going to say that like one of the biggest

492
00:34:57,309 --> 00:35:02,453
things that's happened as a result of COVID is that we have permission to let people work

493
00:35:02,553 --> 00:35:04,655
in their environments at home where they're comfortable.

494
00:35:05,075 --> 00:35:10,280
It's really, really common for, you know, people that are on the Asperger's or autism

495
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:14,263
spectrum, for example, to really struggle with being in a shared office space where

496
00:35:14,283 --> 00:35:16,846
there are a lot of uncontrollable smells and noises.

497
00:35:18,006 --> 00:35:22,149
and interruptions and being at home in your own space

498
00:35:22,169 --> 00:35:23,790
where you have control over your space,

499
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:25,191
if you're differently abled,

500
00:35:25,431 --> 00:35:28,033
having the accessible technology that you already have,

501
00:35:28,393 --> 00:35:31,355
being able to purchase that and send it to people

502
00:35:31,455 --> 00:35:34,157
and having a wave of people realizing,

503
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:37,139
oh, I need to actually have an ergonomic setup.

504
00:35:37,219 --> 00:35:40,661
I need to be able to get away from my computer for breaks

505
00:35:40,761 --> 00:35:42,382
because I have to do childcare.

506
00:35:42,702 --> 00:35:45,484
There's been a huge conversation as a result of COVID

507
00:35:45,504 --> 00:35:46,465
around accessibility.

508
00:35:47,825 --> 00:36:03,294
I'll give you a perfect example when I first founded Phenomena here in San Francisco, and was looking for an office space, I found it almost impossible to find a building that was affordable, that had ADA compliant, you know, entryways that was accessible

509
00:36:03,334 --> 00:36:04,795
to someone who might have a wheelchair.

510
00:36:05,415 --> 00:36:09,296
And it just was like, okay, well, if we can't build a wheelchair accessible office space

511
00:36:09,736 --> 00:36:14,357
on a budget, if we can't find a place, then we'll just have a work from home policy that

512
00:36:14,717 --> 00:36:18,998
if we hire you and you can't get access to the space, we'll have a work from home policy.

513
00:36:19,018 --> 00:36:23,259
But then it generated this huge conversation. Well, like, what does it mean to be the person,

514
00:36:23,479 --> 00:36:27,960
as Ashley is saying, who isn't at the office? And like, how do you create a sense of

515
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:31,401
well-being and inclusion for people that can't be in the physical office?

516
00:36:31,941 --> 00:36:36,988
That, you know, was 10 years ago basically. When I look back at that conversation now I can remember

517
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:41,754
signing the lease that said, if someone complains about this it's your responsibility to fix it.

518
00:36:42,135 --> 00:36:46,100
It's not the landlord's responsibility. There's legal terminology in leases

519
00:36:46,561 --> 00:36:49,505
that essentially offshore a lot of these accessibility issues.

520
00:36:49,845 --> 00:36:56,628
So we were able to afford a large office, the very first thing we did was look for something that was accessible street level, all the bathrooms everything.

521
00:36:57,328 --> 00:37:10,253
It's hard for people who are starting out to instantiate the rules and the spaces that they want to, because in many ways there are financial or legal barriers and so it's just really important to continue to broaden this conversation as a community.

522
00:37:10,734 --> 00:37:14,458
and to make demands of the wider community, the rental communities, for example, in your city,

523
00:37:15,319 --> 00:37:18,423
to really step up and meet these concerns where we're working,

524
00:37:18,543 --> 00:37:20,746
and also to be able to have those conversations in your team.

525
00:37:21,395 --> 00:37:25,860
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I think, you know, if there is any kind of silver lining to COVID,

526
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:34,088
it's obviously been horrific for everybody. And the impact is felt globally on all generations,

527
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:39,094
but we know particularly, you know, people who already have these sort of difficulties

528
00:37:39,614 --> 00:37:42,757
feel isolated. It's been really, really difficult. Young people,

529
00:37:42,797 --> 00:37:44,459
we know, have really, really struggled with it.

530
00:37:46,116 --> 00:37:50,039
you know hopefully we're going to start heading back in the right direction but as I say if there

531
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:54,862
is a silver lining it was kind of a leveler all those people who've been told no you must be in

532
00:37:54,902 --> 00:37:59,545
the office nine to five you know no we can't support work from home well they're going to

533
00:37:59,585 --> 00:38:03,647
really struggle with that argument now and diversely we know that there are some people

534
00:38:04,128 --> 00:38:09,271
because of their sort of isolation they need the partnerships and the working face to face

535
00:38:09,291 --> 00:38:12,713
with people so hopefully there'll be a balance and we can accommodate what people need

536
00:38:13,173 --> 00:38:14,474
that kind of individual

537
00:38:15,606 --> 00:38:19,510
packages for people and really respecting their different needs.

538
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:21,952
That is what inclusivity is about, isn't it?

539
00:38:22,232 --> 00:38:24,654
Again, it's not about saying, well, if you're in a wheelchair,

540
00:38:24,694 --> 00:38:25,635
this is what you get.

541
00:38:25,755 --> 00:38:28,518
It's about that individual person and what support they need.

542
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:32,702
So, yeah, I think that's it's a really important topic to look at that.

543
00:38:33,222 --> 00:38:36,626
I was just coming to you, Robin, to just say about, you know, particularly around,

544
00:38:36,646 --> 00:38:40,910
you know, any trends that you've been seeing recently around.

545
00:38:41,747 --> 00:38:45,169
how we bring in these underrepresented groups. So obviously you talked a little bit about

546
00:38:45,669 --> 00:38:51,693
physical disabilities. What about kind of the representation stuff more broadly? Have you

547
00:38:51,713 --> 00:38:56,836
seen anything new that you think is worth sharing? Yeah, so Phenomena is what's called a deliberately

548
00:38:56,856 --> 00:38:59,498
developmental organization, a DDO.

549
00:39:00,278 --> 00:39:01,879
There's a paper on it.

550
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:04,920
There's free literature on it, actually, on the internet

551
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,541
through the Harvard Business Review.

552
00:39:07,361 --> 00:39:08,142
And you can look it up,

553
00:39:08,682 --> 00:39:10,083
deliberately developmental organization.

554
00:39:10,103 --> 00:39:12,964
There's also a really great book called An Everyone Culture,

555
00:39:13,404 --> 00:39:15,805
which is about building communities of practice

556
00:39:16,326 --> 00:39:19,347
around the concept of your edge or how you're developing.

557
00:39:20,167 --> 00:39:35,953
And the core concept of the practice is essentially that everyone at the company from the CEO down recognizes that they're a person that has a complicated life, that things happen, that they don't know the answer to everything, that sometimes they make mistakes and need to be corrected.

558
00:39:36,353 --> 00:39:40,595
and need feedback, but also that they welcome that feedback because it helps them grow.

559
00:39:40,615 --> 00:39:45,879
And if you build an organization with this kind of seed of being vulnerable and bringing your

560
00:39:45,899 --> 00:39:50,842
full self to the office, it leads to a lot of other knock-on effects. For example,

561
00:39:51,562 --> 00:39:54,684
the concept of having to be at an office from, say, 10 a.m.

562
00:39:56,365 --> 00:40:01,128
to 5 p.m. has its own stru

563
00:40:01,749 --> 00:40:03,010
and being able to say I'm

564
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:04,111
this week. I'm going to t

565
00:40:04,131 --> 00:40:05,091
days off. No questions as

566
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:06,032
team will move around tha

567
00:40:06,052 --> 00:40:07,814
how to deal with their ta

568
00:40:07,854 --> 00:40:08,614
can get the space and the

569
00:40:08,654 --> 00:40:09,855
be mentally well. But I w

570
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,062
or I'm dealing with a health issue at home or whatever,

571
00:40:20,062 --> 00:40:22,403
the more you surface those needs,

572
00:40:22,704 --> 00:40:25,365
which are just human needs in work culture,

573
00:40:25,745 --> 00:40:26,786
the better your work culture is

574
00:40:26,806 --> 00:40:28,987
and the more supportive it is for a variety of people.

575
00:40:29,007 --> 00:40:30,027
So that's one way to do it.

576
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:31,488
And then the other thing I think

577
00:40:31,508 --> 00:40:33,189
that I've seen a lot recently,

578
00:40:33,289 --> 00:40:34,770
especially in the academic space,

579
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:42,517
is the inclusion of a diversity, equity, and anti-racism statement in any job application,

580
00:40:43,138 --> 00:40:49,263
which says, please outline your experience with these issues, how you're affecting those issues

581
00:40:49,324 --> 00:40:54,468
in your work, and what your aspirations are in this space. Reading that ahead of

582
00:40:55,669 --> 00:41:02,411
taking the rest of the resume in and then also anonymizing the resume as much as possible removing

583
00:41:03,271 --> 00:41:08,553
identifiers from the resume that would otherwise bias you about the experience in the resume.

584
00:41:08,913 --> 00:41:13,754
If you read the diversity statement first and make a call of the resumes based on that

585
00:41:14,459 --> 00:41:17,182
and then read these anonymized resumes,

586
00:41:17,682 --> 00:41:19,244
you get a very diverse pool.

587
00:41:19,984 --> 00:41:22,086
And actually, it's exceptionally helpful

588
00:41:22,467 --> 00:41:24,969
because it's very easy to spot language in the diversity

589
00:41:25,009 --> 00:41:27,812
statements that's talking the talking points

590
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:29,033
but not really walking them.

591
00:41:29,593 --> 00:41:31,936
And I think that that practice has been really helpful to me.

592
00:41:32,716 --> 00:41:37,079
And my colleagues at school have really educated me quite a bit on the ways in which there's

593
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,441
just so much unconscious bias in the way that we hire.

594
00:41:39,641 --> 00:41:44,244
And so I think those two things have really been, have been structurally, you know, reformative

595
00:41:44,324 --> 00:41:45,265
and transformative for me.

596
00:41:46,276 --> 00:41:53,840
Fantastic, thank you. And even, you know, I'm just thinking back to the kind of age old issues, trying to get women into these kind of workforces.

597
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:59,723
So we still hear that when they're getting options at school of which topics they're going to do for their exams,

598
00:42:00,183 --> 00:42:04,645
they're still pushing girls towards the caring and the nursing and all of those lovely soft skills.

599
00:42:05,706 --> 00:42:10,508
Definitely. You know, when when people want to do proper STEM subjects, they kind of, wow, are you sure?

600
00:42:10,568 --> 00:42:12,149
Is that what are you thinking you're going to do?

601
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:17,314
and so it's really disappointing that I still regularly hear those conversations are happening

602
00:42:17,694 --> 00:42:23,161
but then even in the workplaces you say flexibility whatever whether it is a child care

603
00:42:23,501 --> 00:42:29,087
whether it is you know as you say sickness or I'm just not coping today I just don't want to come in

604
00:42:29,508 --> 00:42:31,730
we should all respect that and support that.

605
00:42:32,711 --> 00:42:38,374
If we're hiring good quality people and we trust them, then we should be providing that as a standard.

606
00:42:38,494 --> 00:42:42,496
So it's a shame that we even happen to have that bit of a conversation, but here we are.

607
00:42:42,976 --> 00:42:47,318
I also actually saw a wonderful example this morning on a call.

608
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:52,581
I had a call with some colleagues, safety colleagues in Australia at the East Safety Commissioner's office.

609
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:58,206
and as I was just scrolling through the website they have a beautiful statement which I'll just

610
00:42:58,246 --> 00:43:02,029
read a little bit of it but it's, Be Safe technologies the traditional custodians of

611
00:43:02,109 --> 00:43:06,153
country throughout Australia and their continuing connection to land waters and community.

612
00:43:06,733 --> 00:43:11,278
We pay our respects to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures and to elders past

613
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:15,441
present and emerging and then there's a little bit of a content warning on there because it's

614
00:43:15,481 --> 00:43:16,262
something that would be.

615
00:43:16,925 --> 00:43:20,406
you know, highly offensive and upsetting for people should they see the content.

616
00:43:20,947 --> 00:43:23,568
And I just thought that was so sensitive, so subtle.

617
00:43:23,628 --> 00:43:27,189
It's not like a big poppy, you know, pop up in the middle of the screen

618
00:43:27,209 --> 00:43:29,049
and they'll shout it's just there. It's subtle.

619
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:32,410
But it just felt very respectful to me, very inclusive.

620
00:43:32,531 --> 00:43:35,151
And yeah, I was really pleased that it just happened today

621
00:43:35,171 --> 00:43:36,432
and we were able to talk about it.

622
00:43:36,492 --> 00:43:39,433
So, yeah, I think that's a really great example.

623
00:43:39,493 --> 00:43:40,453
But yeah, thank you.

624
00:43:40,493 --> 00:43:44,134
I think, you know, some some really interesting points for us to think about

625
00:43:44,194 --> 00:43:46,655
and to keep building and iterating on that. Definitely.

626
00:43:48,212 --> 00:43:50,413
So, OK, we're going to turn a little bit into the tricky stuff.

627
00:43:51,034 --> 00:43:54,817
We're talking about the positives and what we're trying to do now.

628
00:43:54,837 --> 00:43:59,020
What are some of the barriers to creating really inclusive spaces?

629
00:43:59,701 --> 00:44:03,024
From my experience, a lot of people get it really, really wrong.

630
00:44:04,425 --> 00:44:06,867
So I'm going to come to you first, Ashley.

631
00:44:06,907 --> 00:44:08,328
Do you have any thoughts on this?

632
00:44:08,428 --> 00:44:11,250
Why why it's so hard for some people? Why does it go wrong?

633
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:13,933
Well, as for.

634
00:44:14,505 --> 00:44:20,488
Some of the biggest barriers, most definitely the community, as gaming hasn't been accessible

635
00:44:20,508 --> 00:44:25,651
in the past, it's attracted a largely unaccepting and even harmful community.

636
00:44:26,711 --> 00:44:33,695
We have a long while to go before we can truly say that the gaming community is accepting

637
00:44:34,075 --> 00:44:35,456
in various different ways.

638
00:44:38,214 --> 00:44:42,636
One of the biggest issues I've seen, especially among developers on the

639
00:44:42,816 --> 00:44:50,239
Roblox platform who are often quite new to the field, is a lack of appreciation for well-established

640
00:44:50,519 --> 00:44:59,523
and reliable accessibility guidelines like WCAG and the like. Even something as simple as text

641
00:44:59,563 --> 00:45:07,286
contrast goes ignored, that's a lot of people here are already excluding and alienating as a result.

642
00:45:08,642 --> 00:45:11,583
Another one is usage of inclusive language.

643
00:45:12,383 --> 00:45:27,748
A few commonly mistaken examples is the usage of he or she, instead of they, which could include a lot more gender identities and populations and stuff like that.

644
00:45:27,948 --> 00:45:37,130
You know, for profession descriptions, like people will use fireman and policeman.

645
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:41,572
you know, alternate terms, much more inclusive ones would be

646
00:45:42,152 --> 00:45:45,674
firefighter or police officer instead of having them all

647
00:45:47,434 --> 00:45:52,637
gendered in some way. When an adult, you should consult

648
00:45:52,717 --> 00:45:56,659
others, talking to people who experience issues firsthand is

649
00:45:56,899 --> 00:46:00,481
much better than completely approaching them on your own.

650
00:46:01,101 --> 00:46:04,283
Not doing this allows a larger risk of either grossing

651
00:46:04,483 --> 00:46:05,483
misrepresentation.

652
00:46:05,854 --> 00:46:10,938
misrepresenting the populations you're attempting to be mindful of or making matters worse.

653
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:17,043
Yeah fantastic you raise some brilliant points there Ashley and uh you know I think

654
00:46:17,835 --> 00:46:23,076
platforms all over are guilty of quite a lot of those. And again, you know, the gendering of job

655
00:46:23,117 --> 00:46:28,098
roles. I mean, again, it's just it's back to that point. We are still bringing up small children

656
00:46:28,278 --> 00:46:33,820
using that terminology. You'd really think we would have moved forward. But and people are

657
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:38,162
really resistant people, you know, when we hear the snowflakes and all of these sorts of things

658
00:46:38,222 --> 00:46:39,342
being thrown around. Yeah.

659
00:46:40,343 --> 00:46:42,945
that you don't want to call it a policeman, you know, come on.

660
00:46:44,686 --> 00:46:47,188
Yeah, we really need to push for change, I think, in these areas.

661
00:46:47,729 --> 00:46:49,670
And is there anything you could add about the barriers?

662
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:51,812
Why do people get it so wrong all the time?

663
00:46:52,613 --> 00:46:57,157
You know, sometimes people are afraid of what they do not know.

664
00:46:57,177 --> 00:46:59,739
And it's about communication.

665
00:47:00,731 --> 00:47:07,735
mostly. So they wouldn't really have the basic tools for communicating with others that are not,

666
00:47:07,995 --> 00:47:14,339
that doesn't seem to them like they are so different. So it starts from there, I think,

667
00:47:14,639 --> 00:47:20,643
and from thinking within my team anyway, there are some times where we are having lunch

668
00:47:21,383 --> 00:47:26,947
and there are like funny conversations happening because some of the worlds are so different.

669
00:47:27,455 --> 00:47:29,956
fundamentally different from each other.

670
00:47:30,116 --> 00:47:32,097
So how do I accept that?

671
00:47:32,437 --> 00:47:35,399
How can I feel comfortable to share who I am

672
00:47:35,739 --> 00:47:37,280
and be accepted by others?

673
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:39,782
And so I think that, you know,

674
00:47:39,802 --> 00:47:43,644
it's about developing the communication tools

675
00:47:43,984 --> 00:47:46,345
within your team, within your family,

676
00:47:46,645 --> 00:47:49,187
with your children, where you're living.

677
00:47:49,587 --> 00:47:51,528
So it's about that, I think.

678
00:47:51,568 --> 00:47:54,430
This is the shift that needs to occur

679
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:56,671
in order for us to feel comfortable.

680
00:47:57,289 --> 00:47:59,250
and for it to become like a non-issue.

681
00:47:59,370 --> 00:48:02,934
So I think that it's a big challenge,

682
00:48:03,034 --> 00:48:05,676
but if we start with small baby steps,

683
00:48:06,677 --> 00:48:08,959
then for me, it's like, okay, let's figure out

684
00:48:09,079 --> 00:48:11,581
what would be the best tools for communicating

685
00:48:11,621 --> 00:48:11,922
and let's...

686
00:48:12,419 --> 00:48:18,681
find the things that are common and that we can collaborate on. So I think that one of the things

687
00:48:18,742 --> 00:48:24,784
we love to do in the team with the remote, but also with the Israeli-based team, is to play.

688
00:48:25,364 --> 00:48:31,827
We like to play together. So every week someone choose a game. We all hop in and we play for an

689
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:38,069
hour, an hour and a half. And we talk while we play. And it's fantastic. And it brings out so much

690
00:48:38,789 --> 00:48:44,855
of you know who you are and what you like to do and what happened to you today and so this makes

691
00:48:44,935 --> 00:48:52,241
people feel much more closer so you know perfecting those tools of communication

692
00:48:53,322 --> 00:48:57,886
can be really helpful. I love that, that kind of play therapy is one.

693
00:48:58,566 --> 00:49:09,337
But we know, you know, it's often used within the childcare and literally in therapy is you don't sit down across a desk from a young person and get them to talk about their issues.

694
00:49:09,788 --> 00:49:13,171
you go for a walk, you take them for a drive, you do something totally different

695
00:49:13,231 --> 00:49:16,694
and you're going to get a really different response and just that relaxed,

696
00:49:16,754 --> 00:49:18,035
comfortable conversation.

697
00:49:18,095 --> 00:49:20,097
And I love that as an idea for a team.

698
00:49:20,177 --> 00:49:22,179
I am definitely taking that back to my team.

699
00:49:22,219 --> 00:49:24,041
We're long overdue some playtime together.

700
00:49:24,481 --> 00:49:26,863
Robin, is there anything you can add around the barriers?

701
00:49:27,444 --> 00:49:29,285
Why is it why is it so hard for people?

702
00:49:30,274 --> 00:49:39,665
I think, you know, one of the more recent books that I read that I really enjoyed is a book called Braiding Sweetgrass by another Robin, Robin Wall Kimmerer.

703
00:49:40,085 --> 00:49:47,694
She's an indigenous plant scientist who's actually born and raised in the same area that I grew up in upstate New York in the Great Lakes region.

704
00:49:48,895 --> 00:49:53,157
And I think that one of the best things about her book,

705
00:49:53,197 --> 00:49:56,298
which is a series of essays around different topics,

706
00:49:56,378 --> 00:49:58,920
but always focusing on sort of sustainability,

707
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:00,801
the environment and the ways in which we engage

708
00:50:00,821 --> 00:50:03,342
with the planet, is that there are really,

709
00:50:03,422 --> 00:50:07,104
really different ways to approach the concept of authority,

710
00:50:07,544 --> 00:50:10,286
the concept of knowing and the concept of having.

711
00:50:10,946 --> 00:50:15,649
Like in the cultures that have colonized the planet for the most part, there's this performance

712
00:50:15,669 --> 00:50:21,634
of authority, performance of knowing, performance of structural power that we unconsciously take on.

713
00:50:22,094 --> 00:50:25,737
And what she does is in a really beautiful and poetic way, because she's also a poet,

714
00:50:26,737 --> 00:50:32,762
is unpack some of the language, the scientific language around plants, you know,

715
00:50:33,022 --> 00:50:35,704
categorizing objects, thinking about species.

716
00:50:36,604 --> 00:50:42,249
our relationship with species. And one of the most interesting things in the book is this concept of

717
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:47,914
the honorable harvest, which is that her people in the original sort of configuration that they

718
00:50:47,954 --> 00:50:52,619
found themselves growing up in the world had a practice of whenever they went someplace and

719
00:50:52,679 --> 00:50:56,882
found something like, let's say, mushrooms or sweetgrass that you could harvest, you never

720
00:50:56,922 --> 00:51:02,527
take the first thing you find. You ask before you take anything. So you sit and you sit with the

721
00:51:02,567 --> 00:51:02,848
place.

722
00:51:03,408 --> 00:51:05,309
and say, is it okay for me to have some of this?

723
00:51:05,769 --> 00:51:09,091
You leave half and you leave it better than you found it.

724
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:11,272
So if you find a place, for example, to set up camp,

725
00:51:11,652 --> 00:51:12,633
you set up camp on the river.

726
00:51:12,873 --> 00:51:14,574
When you leave, you leave a bundle of firewood

727
00:51:14,594 --> 00:51:17,035
where you had a fire to welcome the next person

728
00:51:17,055 --> 00:51:18,035
that will find that place.

729
00:51:18,476 --> 00:51:20,437
And the idea is that animals and people

730
00:51:20,537 --> 00:51:21,917
live in this space together.

731
00:51:22,318 --> 00:51:23,598
And the idea of the honorable harvest

732
00:51:23,638 --> 00:51:26,300
is that even if other humans don't eat the mushrooms,

733
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:29,901
perhaps a deer will, perhaps a little raccoon will.

734
00:51:30,262 --> 00:51:37,308
And that deer or raccoon or whoever is living in that space is part of the structures and the systems that make that place sustainable.

735
00:51:37,408 --> 00:51:44,214
And I think when I listen to Anat talking about this or Ashley talking about this idea of the fundamental lack of inclusion,

736
00:51:44,335 --> 00:51:53,543
what I always hear beneath these things is the performance of authority, the performance of knowing and that vulnerability that you get in a team when you have,

737
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:57,266
you know, lunch and learns about different cultural food practices or.

738
00:51:57,767 --> 00:52:01,530
like a donut meetup where you just meet with a random person, have a donut and talk, even through

739
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:05,855
the pandemic. These kinds of things that we've instituted at Phenomena, they're about letting

740
00:52:05,895 --> 00:52:10,719
go of this notion of authority and really being just a person in a space. And I think that her

741
00:52:10,759 --> 00:52:18,026
book is really good at sort of unpacking how deeply and structurally this idea of authority, power,

742
00:52:18,286 --> 00:52:19,548
having, owning,

743
00:52:20,088 --> 00:52:24,354
is part of our approach as sort of a Western influence culture.

744
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:28,520
And it's a really good thing to sort of to ask yourself on a daily basis

745
00:52:28,881 --> 00:52:31,945
what you have, what you own, and what you think you know.

746
00:52:31,965 --> 00:52:35,230
Yeah, I think that idea of kind of nurture.

747
00:52:35,885 --> 00:52:37,867
is really interesting and I'm fascinated.

748
00:52:37,887 --> 00:52:40,889
I actually had a conversation only yesterday with a really close friend

749
00:52:41,389 --> 00:52:45,412
and they had this idea that humans are the custodians of the planet

750
00:52:45,452 --> 00:52:49,055
and that we are here to just help along the life cycle

751
00:52:49,095 --> 00:52:50,856
and that we shouldn't actually impact it.

752
00:52:50,896 --> 00:52:52,778
We're just there to nurture and to support.

753
00:52:52,838 --> 00:52:54,779
So I'm absolutely loving that idea.

754
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:59,223
And that really does apply not just with wildlife and flora and fauna.

755
00:52:59,243 --> 00:53:00,303
It applies to teams, right?

756
00:53:00,363 --> 00:53:03,506
If you think of yourself as enabling a team, you know, that's how I see it.

757
00:53:03,526 --> 00:53:04,166
So beautifully.

758
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:10,582
Do no harm. So we've only got a very short while left, so I'm going to kind of speed through this.

759
00:53:10,622 --> 00:53:17,025
I'm going to ask one question about collaboration. So we know this is part of the

760
00:53:17,926 --> 00:53:23,288
Fair Play Alliance Summit, so we know bringing industry together can create wonderful,

761
00:53:23,328 --> 00:53:29,131
wonderful things, sharing best practices. I know that Raising Good Gamers, for example,

762
00:53:29,151 --> 00:53:33,513
are doing some fantastic work as well, bringing industry voices together.

763
00:53:34,489 --> 00:53:39,211
and looking at kind of how collaborations, sharing tools and all sorts of things on this.

764
00:53:39,651 --> 00:53:46,654
Do you guys know of other projects or organisations who are really doing that stuff?

765
00:53:46,894 --> 00:53:50,676
And what does good cross industry collaboration really look like? I'll start with you again, Robin.

766
00:53:52,290 --> 00:54:05,257
I would actually just say that the Fair Play Alliance is a perfect example of, you know, a motivated group of people really trying. I think the AIAS, Megan Scavio has been really leading that community, the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences,

767
00:54:05,577 --> 00:54:08,279
to do more work, sponsoring women, people of color.

768
00:54:08,819 --> 00:54:11,881
queer and trans folks in breaking in at the executive level.

769
00:54:12,121 --> 00:54:16,463
So, you know, inviting them to DICE and giving them exposure to business development practices,

770
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:21,066
which I think we need to do interventions at the top of the food chain in addition to the bottom.

771
00:54:21,446 --> 00:54:25,668
And then the third one I'll mention is the OneUp Fund, which is run by Ed Freese,

772
00:54:25,948 --> 00:54:30,330
who was the founder of the Xbox. He's built a really inclusive and amazing

773
00:54:31,231 --> 00:54:37,434
process-oriented investment fund that supports developers from a variety of walks of life in a

774
00:54:37,474 --> 00:54:38,015
way that's really...

775
00:54:38,415 --> 00:54:42,557
compelling and I think that as we continue to grow the industry and more people make money,

776
00:54:42,857 --> 00:54:47,900
we'll see funds and sponsorship coming from more diverse people and that's when we'll truly see

777
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:53,864
the way that Ashley and her colleagues deserve, you know, is when people who've made it are also

778
00:54:54,084 --> 00:55:01,128
from these groups and sponsoring them to continue to develop. Pay it forward, very much. Annette,

779
00:55:01,208 --> 00:55:05,851
is there anything you want to add to this point? What are you seeing? Oh sure, I think you know

780
00:55:06,311 --> 00:55:07,452
Robin said it so well.

781
00:55:08,328 --> 00:55:14,831
Yes. Perfect, okay so we have three questions for wrapping up. So what are the opportunities of

782
00:55:14,871 --> 00:55:21,094
building in a metaverse space? I think you know the opportunities are like endless.

783
00:55:23,415 --> 00:55:29,218
We at Toya I think we buy into Dave's vision of creating whole new economies on the platform.

784
00:55:30,338 --> 00:55:35,221
We see the platform as a very accessible and constructive place.

785
00:55:35,905 --> 00:55:40,928
that can create financial opportunities and jobs and even new careers for

786
00:55:41,008 --> 00:55:43,429
many young people across a number of fields.

787
00:55:44,490 --> 00:55:48,552
And I think that also being here on the platform in the early days of

788
00:55:48,992 --> 00:55:52,454
real world brands and IPs coming onto Roblox

789
00:55:53,055 --> 00:55:56,296
is also an incredible opportunity and responsibility.

790
00:55:57,008 --> 00:56:03,512
I think it means we can influence the way that brands participate and create greater, you know,

791
00:56:03,552 --> 00:56:09,777
inclusion and acceptance and like really align with the core values of the platform,

792
00:56:09,877 --> 00:56:17,402
like around creativity and accessibility and inclusion and fun. So being a part of that,

793
00:56:17,502 --> 00:56:22,805
like helping big brands build themselves and bringing them in as an opportunity

794
00:56:23,466 --> 00:56:26,228
to rewrite the narrative. This is how I see it.

795
00:56:27,194 --> 00:56:30,055
It really is, and I'm so pleased, Anna, you used the word fun.

796
00:56:30,175 --> 00:56:32,556
This has been very weighty topics.

797
00:56:32,596 --> 00:56:36,037
We talked about all that serious stuff that ultimately we want to create

798
00:56:36,117 --> 00:56:39,377
experiences and places that are fun for everybody.

799
00:56:39,417 --> 00:56:41,238
We want them to have a good time when they're hanging out,

800
00:56:41,718 --> 00:56:43,599
as well as all of this representation.

801
00:56:44,139 --> 00:56:47,340
OK, we have our last couple of minutes, so I am going to just ask this question.

802
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:50,240
Ashley, I would love to come back to you on this, if it's OK.

803
00:56:50,901 --> 00:56:54,922
What advice would you give to the next generation of young game developers

804
00:56:55,382 --> 00:56:56,502
for building content?

805
00:56:58,322 --> 00:57:06,627
As the next generation of game developers, your number one goal should be to accommodate for the next generation of gamers.

806
00:57:07,767 --> 00:57:14,150
It's perfect. I think that you summed it up in one line. Robin, Anna, just one line on that. Do you have thoughts?

807
00:57:15,805 --> 00:57:20,467
I really believe that actually bringing your full self to whatever creative activity you do is so important.

808
00:57:20,887 --> 00:57:36,932
Really learning to have the confidence to speak from your experience and building things that reflect that experience is the best way, especially with games, to give other people an opportunity to identify with you, to empathise with you and to experience your perspective.

809
00:57:37,632 --> 00:57:38,812
Wonderful. Thank you, Annette.

810
00:57:39,987 --> 00:57:41,529
I don't think I have anything to add.

811
00:57:41,589 --> 00:57:42,290
I think I just want to...

812
00:57:42,310 --> 00:57:44,394
Okay, I'm going to throw the last question to you then.

813
00:57:44,414 --> 00:57:46,357
If you had a crystal ball,

814
00:57:47,258 --> 00:57:49,562
what do you think the next big development

815
00:57:49,702 --> 00:57:51,945
in terms of inclusion and representation

816
00:57:51,985 --> 00:57:53,808
and how we embrace diversity?

817
00:57:53,868 --> 00:57:55,451
What do you think is going to be the next big thing?

818
00:57:59,131 --> 00:58:05,016
And I think that when it comes that we would not need to discuss that any longer,

819
00:58:05,176 --> 00:58:09,961
so no one would know who you are and you can be, you can really be what you want to be.

820
00:58:10,802 --> 00:58:15,306
That's the next step for me, next phase, yes. I'm so looking forward to that.

821
00:58:15,746 --> 00:58:20,631
And that for me is the perfect wrap up. Thank you so much for being on the panel today. It's

822
00:58:20,671 --> 00:58:24,935
been a fantastic conversation. I'm sure everyone's going to really enjoy it. Thank you all so much.

823
00:58:28,456 --> 00:58:28,523
you
