1
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:17,274
So, hi everybody. I have the pleasure of telling you a bit about success via

2
00:00:17,274 --> 00:00:22,138
community-based game development today. My name is Philomena. I'm the co-founder

3
00:00:22,138 --> 00:00:26,241
of a small indie studio based in Zurich, Switzerland. We are called Strayfawn

4
00:00:26,241 --> 00:00:30,445
Studio and we're currently six people just working on our own games, publishing

5
00:00:30,445 --> 00:00:32,546
our own games and trying to survive.

6
00:00:33,247 --> 00:00:37,827
So, let's get some insights here of what community-based development actually is.

7
00:00:37,827 --> 00:00:42,548
So this is Indie Game Guy, we'll call him.

8
00:00:42,548 --> 00:00:47,949
Indie Game Guy, he's working on his own project, he loves making games, he's been working on

9
00:00:47,949 --> 00:00:53,370
it in his free time all the time, and then after three years of hard work, the game is

10
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:54,390
finally done.

11
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:59,871
By that time, Indie Guy has grown a beard, of course, because we all know making games

12
00:00:59,871 --> 00:01:00,391
is hard.

13
00:01:00,391 --> 00:01:02,131
But the problem is...

14
00:01:02,632 --> 00:01:05,594
The game is cool and all, but nobody cares.

15
00:01:05,594 --> 00:01:08,015
It kind of didn't work out.

16
00:01:08,015 --> 00:01:11,478
Somehow he didn't really manage to find his target audience.

17
00:01:11,478 --> 00:01:13,960
Press wasn't really interested.

18
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,961
Yeah, that's what happens sometimes.

19
00:01:15,961 --> 00:01:19,724
But what if I tell you that Indie Game Guy could have done

20
00:01:19,724 --> 00:01:22,286
one thing differently, and it could have turned out

21
00:01:22,286 --> 00:01:23,186
completely different?

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,984
So this is Indie Game Guy again, but instead of just working for three years,

23
00:01:29,984 --> 00:01:32,045
he's showing the game to people.

24
00:01:32,045 --> 00:01:35,468
He's actually showing it early in a prototype phase,

25
00:01:35,468 --> 00:01:38,390
involving them into development,

26
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,251
showing them why they should maybe care,

27
00:01:40,251 --> 00:01:43,473
involving them, listening to their ideas,

28
00:01:43,473 --> 00:01:45,915
and actually forming a little group around his game.

29
00:01:47,002 --> 00:01:51,305
Then again, the beard has grown three years later, making games is still hard.

30
00:01:51,305 --> 00:01:54,667
But this time, Indie Game Guy is not alone.

31
00:01:54,667 --> 00:01:59,591
He doesn't have to be that one person team or maybe that three person small team

32
00:01:59,591 --> 00:02:03,313
that is fighting the war against reaching people.

33
00:02:03,313 --> 00:02:06,896
But instead, Indie Game Guy now has a whole troop of people

34
00:02:06,896 --> 00:02:10,939
that he gathered up along the way that are making all kinds of noises

35
00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:13,440
and helping him to get the word out about his game.

36
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,101
So this is a little thing I call the us state.

37
00:02:19,101 --> 00:02:22,722
This is the state when it's not you against the rest of the

38
00:02:22,722 --> 00:02:26,343
world, but you and a group of people who really believe in

39
00:02:26,343 --> 00:02:31,784
your idea just as much as you do, and you all want this game

40
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:32,124
to succeed.

41
00:02:32,124 --> 00:02:36,565
So you might still wonder, why should I get there?

42
00:02:38,521 --> 00:02:41,705
So one reason to try and really build up a group around your

43
00:02:41,705 --> 00:02:44,409
game is that you will get constant feedback.

44
00:02:44,409 --> 00:02:47,313
And that, of course, improves your game if you listen to it.

45
00:02:47,313 --> 00:02:49,696
If you hear like five times that something is off, it's

46
00:02:49,696 --> 00:02:51,819
probably really off and you should work on it.

47
00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:53,061
So in the end, you have a better game.

48
00:02:54,082 --> 00:03:00,324
Also, it will be very motivating to work with your players because we all know this point in development

49
00:03:00,324 --> 00:03:05,045
where like you come across a problem that is so hard and you're just ah and

50
00:03:05,045 --> 00:03:05,385
You know

51
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:11,446
I had this other cool idea that I could be working on and it's probably working out better and a lot of us then just

52
00:03:11,446 --> 00:03:15,527
tend to like jump over to the next project and never ever finish one

53
00:03:16,067 --> 00:03:27,339
And if you have a group of people that is actually involved in the project already and they care about whatever being fixed and it being updated, you will be prevented from doing that.

54
00:03:27,339 --> 00:03:33,806
And other than that, you will see a lot of marketing benefits because, of course, many mouths can shout louder than one.

55
00:03:35,532 --> 00:03:39,016
So if you think this sounds neat and this sounds like a good idea,

56
00:03:39,016 --> 00:03:40,658
how do I actually get there?

57
00:03:40,658 --> 00:03:43,221
Then this is probably a session that you will enjoy.

58
00:03:43,221 --> 00:03:47,026
So it all starts with your game.

59
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:50,130
If you make a game and it's nothing special at all,

60
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,793
like it can't differentiate from other games.

61
00:03:53,474 --> 00:03:57,097
This is not going to work out, whatever technique you may be using.

62
00:03:57,097 --> 00:04:00,540
So, first off, you should be thinking about making a game with hooks.

63
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:05,364
So, this can be anything. This can be a very special graphic style.

64
00:04:05,364 --> 00:04:11,068
This can be a special narrative, a special main character, a special game mechanic.

65
00:04:11,068 --> 00:04:13,990
But you just really need to think about what it is.

66
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:16,953
So, for example, this is the first game that we made.

67
00:04:16,953 --> 00:04:20,716
We released this last year in September.

68
00:04:20,996 --> 00:04:24,098
It's a game where you basically have a group of animals.

69
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:25,700
It's a game about population genetics,

70
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,862
so you try to keep your group of animals alive

71
00:04:28,862 --> 00:04:32,525
against all odds, like predators and climate change.

72
00:04:32,525 --> 00:04:34,707
And we thought about what are actually

73
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:37,029
the hooks with this game when we worked on it.

74
00:04:37,469 --> 00:04:40,390
So first of all, it's a science-based game.

75
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:44,852
So you bring in people that are interested in biology or

76
00:04:44,852 --> 00:04:46,452
in genetics specifically.

77
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,113
Because in this game, you will actually

78
00:04:48,113 --> 00:04:49,573
learn how genetics work.

79
00:04:49,573 --> 00:04:53,895
So we got all the dog breeders and biology teachers who are

80
00:04:53,895 --> 00:04:57,376
coming in because they think this is an interesting topic.

81
00:04:57,376 --> 00:05:00,317
Then there's the cute aspect of it.

82
00:05:00,317 --> 00:05:02,537
You look at it and you say, oh, that's cute.

83
00:05:02,537 --> 00:05:05,578
If you're generally into cute things, you will probably be

84
00:05:05,578 --> 00:05:06,579
attracted to this game.

85
00:05:07,499 --> 00:05:09,400
And the third point is its genre.

86
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,261
At least back then when we were working on it,

87
00:05:12,261 --> 00:05:14,683
survival and roguelike games were like super hip.

88
00:05:14,683 --> 00:05:17,364
The marketing is getting more crowded currently,

89
00:05:17,364 --> 00:05:20,845
but back then it was like, huh, there's this cute game

90
00:05:20,845 --> 00:05:22,546
and it is a survival game.

91
00:05:22,546 --> 00:05:25,628
And that interesting mix kind of brought people in.

92
00:05:27,247 --> 00:05:31,749
So you also get some bonus points if you fulfill the following things.

93
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:37,031
So it is easier to build up a community, I think, if you have a game that is expandable.

94
00:05:37,031 --> 00:05:39,752
We have seen all the cool early access games.

95
00:05:39,752 --> 00:05:44,654
If you have like emergent gameplay, you can add some new things and the game plays differently.

96
00:05:44,654 --> 00:05:48,315
Then people find it very easy to come back to your game and play it again,

97
00:05:48,315 --> 00:05:49,696
even though they have played it earlier.

98
00:05:50,176 --> 00:05:53,539
I don't think it is absolutely necessary for your game to be expandable.

99
00:05:53,539 --> 00:05:58,063
You can have this cool narrative game with a twist at the end, but then you would probably

100
00:05:58,063 --> 00:06:02,607
need to approach your community building a bit differently, because you are not able

101
00:06:02,607 --> 00:06:04,649
to show the game all the time.

102
00:06:04,649 --> 00:06:09,713
But you would probably want to build up a community that is, for example, interested

103
00:06:09,713 --> 00:06:10,834
in detective games.

104
00:06:10,834 --> 00:06:15,698
And you don't even have to show your game, you just build up a community around the topic.

105
00:06:16,499 --> 00:06:28,167
So you get another bonus point if your game is visually appealing, if you can just post it on social media and people can see it and they go like, wow, this is it, and that certainly brings them in easily.

106
00:06:28,167 --> 00:06:33,810
And another one if your game is unique, or at least does a better job at something than other games.

107
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:44,778
So if you, for example, make a driving game, and then you differentiate by saying you make a driving game that is really about drifting, that feels better than any other game, and you bring in people from there.

108
00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:47,970
So you think you have a game, you

109
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:49,231
think you have your hooks in place.

110
00:06:49,231 --> 00:06:52,613
Then you start to think about where to actually find

111
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:54,494
those people.

112
00:06:54,494 --> 00:06:57,736
First thing that comes to mind, especially because we are

113
00:06:57,736 --> 00:06:59,558
at one currently, are events.

114
00:06:59,558 --> 00:07:02,579
There's probably some local events where you live.

115
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:05,802
For example, we started off by just going to a cafe that

116
00:07:05,802 --> 00:07:08,944
is for anime fans and just brought our laptops,

117
00:07:08,944 --> 00:07:11,645
set it up there, let people play, engage them.

118
00:07:11,645 --> 00:07:15,048
And then later on, we also started to travel around a bit.

119
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:22,532
And this also helped, this of course helped to find people, but it also helped us to figure out who our target audience actually is.

120
00:07:22,532 --> 00:07:30,217
Because when we had the first prototype, I believed that this was our target audience, like girls at around 12 years.

121
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:36,400
But by traveling and by talking to so many people, it actually turned out that they are also...

122
00:07:37,441 --> 00:07:41,503
There are also other people who are interested in the game.

123
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:44,664
And this showed us that, okay, there's also adult people

124
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:47,946
and older guys who actually think this is interesting.

125
00:07:47,946 --> 00:07:49,507
And this encouraged us to also add

126
00:07:49,507 --> 00:07:51,388
some more complex mechanics to the game,

127
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:53,388
to say, yeah, we can go really deep

128
00:07:53,388 --> 00:07:54,789
with the whole genetics topic,

129
00:07:54,789 --> 00:07:56,930
and it doesn't have to be super kids-friendly

130
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:59,451
because we will also appeal to adults.

131
00:08:00,435 --> 00:08:01,096
So that helped.

132
00:08:01,096 --> 00:08:04,138
And while you are traveling to those events,

133
00:08:04,138 --> 00:08:07,120
do me a big favor, because I see a lot of indie developers

134
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,382
not doing that, just grab people's email addresses.

135
00:08:10,382 --> 00:08:12,184
If you have someone at your booth,

136
00:08:12,184 --> 00:08:14,806
and they're super enthusiastic about what you're doing,

137
00:08:14,806 --> 00:08:18,028
just ask them if they want to get more information

138
00:08:18,028 --> 00:08:20,209
on the game when you update something,

139
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:22,851
when you launch, at least when you launch.

140
00:08:22,851 --> 00:08:25,433
And they are usually very happy to do it.

141
00:08:25,433 --> 00:08:27,915
They just fill in their name, fill in their email address.

142
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:31,079
and then you can put it into some platform.

143
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:35,144
For example, we use MailChimp to just have them all in place.

144
00:08:35,144 --> 00:08:37,367
And on the day the game actually launches,

145
00:08:37,367 --> 00:08:39,730
you can just send out an email to all of them at once.

146
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:42,694
Because otherwise, all those people you have met

147
00:08:42,694 --> 00:08:45,758
will most likely not know of your launch

148
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:46,840
once the time arrives.

149
00:08:48,546 --> 00:08:53,288
So another thing I'm sure a lot of you are also doing is social media, especially if

150
00:08:53,288 --> 00:08:57,989
your game is very visually appealing, you can look into the different platforms of social

151
00:08:57,989 --> 00:08:58,489
media there are.

152
00:08:58,489 --> 00:09:05,031
There are like a lot of specific subreddits, so you can think what kind of group of specific

153
00:09:05,031 --> 00:09:10,993
people does my game appeal to, or specific hashtags or Facebook groups.

154
00:09:10,993 --> 00:09:13,754
There's just endless things going on there.

155
00:09:14,962 --> 00:09:19,947
And another thing that is sometimes a bit overlooked is related communities.

156
00:09:19,947 --> 00:09:24,352
So for Niche, for this genetics game, one of the biggest inspirations for the game was

157
00:09:24,352 --> 00:09:29,337
actually a book series which is called Warrior Cats, which is a book series for children

158
00:09:29,337 --> 00:09:32,641
where wild cats live in the forest and try to survive.

159
00:09:33,161 --> 00:09:37,462
and I just thought I would be bold and write the author an email and said,

160
00:09:37,462 --> 00:09:40,543
hey, you wrote this very cool book series and I enjoyed it,

161
00:09:40,543 --> 00:09:44,264
and it was one of the main inspirations to our game.

162
00:09:44,264 --> 00:09:46,664
She replied to that and she liked it a lot,

163
00:09:46,664 --> 00:09:50,305
and she just gave us a lot of shout-outs on social media,

164
00:09:50,305 --> 00:09:53,286
and this brought in a lot of people who liked the Warrior Cat series.

165
00:09:53,286 --> 00:09:56,326
So there are actually a lot of community already in

166
00:09:56,326 --> 00:09:59,967
place that you can just tap into and bring in people from there.

167
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:01,968
You just need to think where they could be.

168
00:10:02,928 --> 00:10:05,069
Which brings me to the next problem.

169
00:10:05,069 --> 00:10:08,230
So if you have those 300 teenage warrior cats

170
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:11,732
reading girls that are interested in your game,

171
00:10:11,732 --> 00:10:13,293
where do you actually bring them?

172
00:10:13,293 --> 00:10:15,634
So they heard about it now, but they don't really

173
00:10:15,634 --> 00:10:18,155
know what to do it because the game is not yet out.

174
00:10:18,155 --> 00:10:20,316
They don't know where to go.

175
00:10:20,316 --> 00:10:21,957
Maybe they go to the website real quick,

176
00:10:21,957 --> 00:10:24,338
but then they're off again and not sure you will ever

177
00:10:24,338 --> 00:10:24,978
reach them again.

178
00:10:26,461 --> 00:10:29,325
So you would want to think about opening up a community hub.

179
00:10:29,325 --> 00:10:32,369
So there are lots of different options again.

180
00:10:32,369 --> 00:10:35,693
One that is currently very popular is Discord,

181
00:10:35,693 --> 00:10:38,236
where you can directly chat with your fans,

182
00:10:38,236 --> 00:10:41,300
or you could open a subreddit and put them there,

183
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,503
or a Facebook group, or your own forum.

184
00:10:43,984 --> 00:10:48,971
Though when you open your own forum it's a bit hard because people then actively need to go to your forum

185
00:10:48,971 --> 00:10:54,279
instead of when they're on Facebook anyways and they're just notified when new content is posted.

186
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:57,684
So there's always some up and downsides on all these platforms.

187
00:10:58,865 --> 00:11:02,988
But there are also some that are very cool to bring people in.

188
00:11:02,988 --> 00:11:05,909
I mean, if you post an amazing trailer on YouTube,

189
00:11:05,909 --> 00:11:10,172
and if you post some cool GIFs on Twitter, that's nice.

190
00:11:10,172 --> 00:11:13,254
But that's actually not where you want your people to be.

191
00:11:13,254 --> 00:11:16,115
I mean, it's very cool to have a lot of Twitter followers,

192
00:11:16,115 --> 00:11:18,296
but that is not actually a community.

193
00:11:18,296 --> 00:11:20,578
So here, Indie Game Guy is just going, yeah,

194
00:11:20,578 --> 00:11:22,199
make this really cool new update.

195
00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:24,820
And people are like, wow, it looks so cool.

196
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,361
That is not a community.

197
00:11:26,361 --> 00:11:28,182
You could call that a fan base.

198
00:11:28,722 --> 00:11:33,986
But if you have a community, what you actually want is people connecting to each other.

199
00:11:33,986 --> 00:11:38,050
It's cool if they're also connecting to you and they're listening to you,

200
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:42,893
but it's very important that they're also making friends with each other and connecting with each other.

201
00:11:45,011 --> 00:11:46,572
So let's sum this up real quick.

202
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:49,633
You're trying to find interested people, bring them

203
00:11:49,633 --> 00:11:53,155
in from events, put them in a newsletter, and then you can

204
00:11:53,155 --> 00:11:55,496
just send out the newsletter and invite

205
00:11:55,496 --> 00:11:58,157
everyone to your Discord.

206
00:11:58,157 --> 00:12:00,438
You can look at related communities or social media.

207
00:12:02,418 --> 00:12:04,099
So you have all those people now.

208
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:05,499
Maybe it's not that many yet.

209
00:12:05,499 --> 00:12:07,820
Maybe it's like 30 or 50 people that you

210
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,600
gathered while you traveled around

211
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,900
or that you found on social media.

212
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,601
But the question is still, how do you handle them?

213
00:12:13,601 --> 00:12:15,201
Like you have this group of people,

214
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:17,102
and it can be maybe a little bit awkward.

215
00:12:17,102 --> 00:12:21,843
And it's actually very cool if you have very few people

216
00:12:21,843 --> 00:12:24,344
in the beginning, because then you have time

217
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:26,724
to form up your backbone.

218
00:12:26,724 --> 00:12:30,405
This is what I call the core of the community.

219
00:12:30,405 --> 00:12:32,165
So you would want to really.

220
00:12:33,766 --> 00:12:38,910
At this point, establish a point and rules, a tone and rules with those people, so you

221
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:44,634
now have the time, if it's like only 30 people, to get to know each of them individually.

222
00:12:44,634 --> 00:12:45,774
You can be a role model.

223
00:12:45,774 --> 00:12:50,978
They will look at you and they will see how you communicate and they can mimic your behavior.

224
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:55,481
And if you're lucky, you have like a very nice tone, everyone is nice with each other,

225
00:12:55,481 --> 00:12:56,662
they all know the rules.

226
00:12:57,621 --> 00:13:03,525
And then when the community grows, this backbone that you formed can then spread into the other

227
00:13:03,525 --> 00:13:05,226
parts of the community body.

228
00:13:05,226 --> 00:13:11,269
You will want to make people feel welcome and at home, so when they are there, they

229
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:16,192
are trying to make friends there, they feel like they can come back, they feel safe when

230
00:13:16,192 --> 00:13:17,713
they say something.

231
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:18,734
This is really...

232
00:13:18,954 --> 00:13:25,059
If you allow people to be rude to each other in this early stage, it will spread like crazy.

233
00:13:25,059 --> 00:13:31,004
So this is really the time where you can look at every single thing you don't want to happen in your community and resolve it.

234
00:13:31,004 --> 00:13:40,191
Then this is also a great time to show people that you are human, because you still have the time, because the community is so small, to connect with each one of them.

235
00:13:40,191 --> 00:13:44,475
You can talk about them, about their hobbies and what you like to do.

236
00:13:44,475 --> 00:13:48,298
And if something ever happens that you don't want to happen, you can talk about it.

237
00:13:48,398 --> 00:13:52,425
that gets you in doubt because something happened that is not that great,

238
00:13:52,425 --> 00:13:56,833
these people will probably jump in because they know you're a nice person.

239
00:13:58,415 --> 00:14:03,299
Another thing that is great if you can do it is if you can show your community the benefits

240
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:05,341
of actually being in your community.

241
00:14:05,341 --> 00:14:11,065
So for example, if you do a new update for your game and you post it in your own forum

242
00:14:11,065 --> 00:14:16,369
first then people will feel very empowered because they see that they are the ones to

243
00:14:16,369 --> 00:14:17,930
get the information first.

244
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:22,914
And then maybe someone is even faster than you, jumps on Twitter and posts the news there

245
00:14:22,914 --> 00:14:25,296
and everyone is like, wow, how do you know?

246
00:14:25,296 --> 00:14:27,678
And they are like, yeah, I'm in the core community, I know.

247
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:31,680
So they feel like really connected to you and really powerful.

248
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,603
Or for example, if you give them some discount codes or whatever that other people are not getting

249
00:14:36,603 --> 00:14:42,547
to really make them feel rewarded for being a part of this core group.

250
00:14:42,547 --> 00:14:45,508
And I think it's also great if you don't have to rush too much.

251
00:14:45,508 --> 00:14:46,869
You can grow slowly.

252
00:14:46,869 --> 00:14:53,613
With Niche, we even had the Facebook group and we only invited in like one new person every few days.

253
00:14:53,613 --> 00:14:55,854
And we actually introduced them to each other.

254
00:14:56,415 --> 00:15:01,476
This is person X, this is person Y, and you're both interested in dogs, go!

255
00:15:01,476 --> 00:15:05,398
And then they started talking to each other and friendships started to form.

256
00:15:05,398 --> 00:15:10,320
And these friendships and those people that are, like, very connected to you become very

257
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,220
important in the long run.

258
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:17,742
In the beginning, when your community is small, it's cool, then you feel connected to them,

259
00:15:17,742 --> 00:15:23,184
that's nice, there's no huge additional thing going on there, but once your community grows,

260
00:15:23,184 --> 00:15:25,205
you will see how that becomes important in a sec.

261
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:29,486
So if everything goes well, you will keep growing.

262
00:15:29,486 --> 00:15:32,949
What you will always want to do is listen to feedback.

263
00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:35,551
Because if you don't want to do that, you probably don't

264
00:15:35,551 --> 00:15:37,233
need a community in the first place.

265
00:15:37,233 --> 00:15:39,035
They are there to talk to you.

266
00:15:39,035 --> 00:15:41,237
They are there to be heard.

267
00:15:41,237 --> 00:15:44,580
So you should always keep your ear open for feedback.

268
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:47,062
And it's great if you can actually implement some of

269
00:15:47,062 --> 00:15:49,204
these suggestions, because people will feel a

270
00:15:49,665 --> 00:15:56,607
read, a huge sense of ownership when you do it. So, don't know. Tom and Lisa made some

271
00:15:56,607 --> 00:16:01,128
cool suggestions and then you add it to the game and you say, this is Lisa's cool suggestion

272
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:06,089
and Lisa will feel like, yeah, my game, my idea made it into the game. And it will feel

273
00:16:06,089 --> 00:16:12,031
a bit more like her game and she will feel a lot more invested in how it actually goes,

274
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:16,432
if it actually manages to sell some copies and to keep sustaining itself.

275
00:16:17,374 --> 00:16:23,501
You want to make your community feel understood, so if there is something going on, maybe some little argument,

276
00:16:23,501 --> 00:16:30,851
just don't just walk away from it, but really talk it out, so you don't have some leftover bad energy in your group.

277
00:16:32,774 --> 00:16:35,837
And one thing that I've seen helping a lot of developers

278
00:16:35,837 --> 00:16:39,301
really communicating clearly with their community

279
00:16:39,301 --> 00:16:42,364
and getting good feedback is if you actually manage

280
00:16:42,364 --> 00:16:44,566
to communicate a clear vision.

281
00:16:44,566 --> 00:16:49,071
For example, with our game, we had some people suggesting

282
00:16:49,071 --> 00:16:51,793
that we should add base building mechanisms like.

283
00:16:52,174 --> 00:16:55,974
your animals should be able to build traps to lure others into,

284
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:57,535
and we just clearly told them,

285
00:16:57,535 --> 00:17:00,715
no, this is not the kind of game we want to make.

286
00:17:00,715 --> 00:17:02,956
We want the animals to be real animals.

287
00:17:02,956 --> 00:17:04,676
They are not able to think like humans.

288
00:17:04,676 --> 00:17:06,717
We want them to migrate around.

289
00:17:06,717 --> 00:17:08,137
And then if they understand it,

290
00:17:08,137 --> 00:17:10,258
the feedback that will come in the future

291
00:17:10,258 --> 00:17:13,398
is a lot more accurate to what you actually want to do.

292
00:17:13,398 --> 00:17:15,759
So you know that this is perfectly in line

293
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:18,119
when the things you want to add to the game

294
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:20,220
and the things your community wants to add to the game

295
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,700
are pretty much the same.

296
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:25,742
And it's important to be always honest and transparent.

297
00:17:25,742 --> 00:17:28,923
So if your update is coming in late, just tell them,

298
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:33,605
yeah, I kind of didn't manage to finish in time, I was sick,

299
00:17:33,605 --> 00:17:36,326
or I didn't feel so well, I'm sorry, I'm putting it up.

300
00:17:36,326 --> 00:17:41,528
And if you're just being honest and transparent on why you're not delivering something,

301
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:43,489
people are usually very, very forgiving.

302
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,121
So if you're doing all these things well,

303
00:17:47,121 --> 00:17:49,041
then your community just keeps growing.

304
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:51,241
Friends are inviting more friends.

305
00:17:51,241 --> 00:17:54,542
And again, the core people that you connected to early on

306
00:17:54,542 --> 00:17:57,182
are becoming very important because at this point,

307
00:17:57,182 --> 00:17:59,483
you will need some people who help out with the community

308
00:17:59,483 --> 00:18:01,123
who do moderations.

309
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:04,424
There might also be other communities of your game

310
00:18:04,424 --> 00:18:06,044
popping up in other places.

311
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:07,844
So suddenly you have a subreddit.

312
00:18:07,844 --> 00:18:11,225
You didn't open it yourself, but other people's open it.

313
00:18:11,225 --> 00:18:12,985
And some people of your core community

314
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,369
jump over there and take on moderation rules.

315
00:18:16,369 --> 00:18:22,535
So, cool, you have a group of people now, you're well connected to them, they listen

316
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:24,077
to you, you listen to them.

317
00:18:24,077 --> 00:18:25,999
Question is, what happens now?

318
00:18:27,395 --> 00:18:31,160
So there's a lot of things you can actually do with your community.

319
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,704
I've been empathizing on this already.

320
00:18:33,704 --> 00:18:35,406
You get a lot of feedback.

321
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:38,590
And if you manage your community well,

322
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:43,577
you also can build up your own internal QA team because.

323
00:18:44,358 --> 00:18:46,879
If you teach people how they actually should report bugs,

324
00:18:46,879 --> 00:18:49,921
like when you report a bug, tell us which version it is,

325
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:51,342
add a screenshot, and so on.

326
00:18:51,342 --> 00:18:53,824
And if you manage to do that early on,

327
00:18:53,824 --> 00:18:56,985
those early members pass on that knowledge,

328
00:18:56,985 --> 00:18:59,287
and it actually becomes a very useful resource

329
00:18:59,287 --> 00:19:01,668
on finding and fixing things in your game.

330
00:19:02,722 --> 00:19:05,025
Community also loves to do localization.

331
00:19:05,025 --> 00:19:07,568
I've seen various games who have done this.

332
00:19:07,568 --> 00:19:09,651
In our case, they have localized the game

333
00:19:09,651 --> 00:19:10,973
to six languages.

334
00:19:10,973 --> 00:19:13,816
We basically just gave them a Google Sheets,

335
00:19:13,816 --> 00:19:17,882
and some people were in charge of each specific language,

336
00:19:17,882 --> 00:19:19,504
and they translated it by themselves.

337
00:19:19,844 --> 00:19:22,186
They're still doing it whenever we are doing an update.

338
00:19:22,186 --> 00:19:24,968
They're jumping in there, adding some more things.

339
00:19:24,968 --> 00:19:27,129
Because again, this is their game as well.

340
00:19:27,129 --> 00:19:28,470
They want to see it expanded.

341
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,372
They want to see new things added.

342
00:19:30,372 --> 00:19:33,674
And they're happy to help with tasks such as this one.

343
00:19:35,256 --> 00:19:38,620
We're currently working on our second game, which is called Nimbatus.

344
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:45,728
There we added an option to very easily export GIFs from the game.

345
00:19:45,728 --> 00:19:50,694
So these are some drones that players have built inside the game.

346
00:19:51,355 --> 00:19:53,515
And this is very useful, I'm sure.

347
00:19:53,515 --> 00:19:57,016
You've all had the situation, it's Saturday again.

348
00:19:57,016 --> 00:19:59,617
Oh, I have to post something for Screenshot Saturday.

349
00:19:59,617 --> 00:20:02,937
I was too busy to record a cool GIF or whatever.

350
00:20:02,937 --> 00:20:06,338
And at this point, you can really just look at what your

351
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:07,258
community is making.

352
00:20:07,258 --> 00:20:09,739
And usually, the things they are making are very cool.

353
00:20:09,739 --> 00:20:12,600
And you can just go there, credit them.

354
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,780
This is also good for you.

355
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,221
This is good for you because you have social media content

356
00:20:17,221 --> 00:20:20,021
to post, and good for them because they feel honored that

357
00:20:20,021 --> 00:20:21,162
they have been featured.

358
00:20:21,702 --> 00:20:27,466
win-win there. And also other fan art which is again cool to post on social

359
00:20:27,466 --> 00:20:32,229
media this is from Niche and it's also very cool and motivating for your team

360
00:20:32,229 --> 00:20:36,392
or for yourself if you see that people are actually spending time creating art

361
00:20:36,392 --> 00:20:40,735
for your game especially if it was like a four-year-old girl who does her

362
00:20:40,735 --> 00:20:42,836
drawing experiences with your game.

363
00:20:44,667 --> 00:20:46,528
Another thing are funding options.

364
00:20:46,528 --> 00:20:49,730
So you can think of whether or not your community would be

365
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:52,511
willing to help you in actually funding your game.

366
00:20:52,511 --> 00:20:56,173
These are two very popular options here, the first of

367
00:20:56,173 --> 00:20:57,734
which is Patreon.

368
00:20:57,734 --> 00:21:00,495
I'm not sure, maybe you've seen how Dwarf Fortress handles

369
00:21:00,495 --> 00:21:03,536
it, so they're basically getting in their development

370
00:21:03,536 --> 00:21:04,917
money over Patreon.

371
00:21:04,917 --> 00:21:08,219
Another very nice example of this recently is Ooblet, who

372
00:21:08,219 --> 00:21:10,600
managed to get some of their development costs

373
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,520
covered by Patreon.

374
00:21:12,481 --> 00:21:17,306
We personally have not used Patreon yet. We are more of the Kickstarter guys.

375
00:21:17,306 --> 00:21:24,414
We have done two Kickstarter campaigns, the first of which was for the first game, Niche, and the other was for Nimbatus.

376
00:21:24,414 --> 00:21:33,123
For some reason they both pretty much acquired the same sum, so around 75,000, even though they were completely different.

377
00:21:33,964 --> 00:21:36,785
I'm going a bit more into depth about that now.

378
00:21:36,785 --> 00:21:39,487
With Niche, we already had a community in place

379
00:21:39,487 --> 00:21:41,147
when we started the Kickstarter.

380
00:21:41,147 --> 00:21:42,628
And we thought, yeah, Kickstarter's

381
00:21:42,628 --> 00:21:46,249
maybe cool to just engage them more and offer them

382
00:21:46,249 --> 00:21:49,231
a way to help us out.

383
00:21:49,231 --> 00:21:51,332
But for Nimbatus, it was completely different there.

384
00:21:51,332 --> 00:21:52,912
We didn't have a community in place at all.

385
00:21:52,912 --> 00:21:56,934
And we actually managed to somehow build it up on the run

386
00:21:56,934 --> 00:21:58,195
doing the Kickstarter.

387
00:21:58,195 --> 00:22:00,956
So I think Kickstarter is good for both engaging

388
00:22:00,956 --> 00:22:02,817
your community, but also really.

389
00:22:03,037 --> 00:22:05,038
building it up and making it bigger.

390
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:09,742
And then, this was the point for me where it really came down to see

391
00:22:09,742 --> 00:22:14,906
is this actually our game? Is this not just the game of our studio,

392
00:22:14,906 --> 00:22:17,488
but is it the game of our players?

393
00:22:17,488 --> 00:22:20,890
So, when we launched it back in September, we clearly communicated

394
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:24,473
to our players that if we don't manage to ship 50,000 units,

395
00:22:24,473 --> 00:22:28,296
then we could no longer update the game because we would not have

396
00:22:28,296 --> 00:22:30,198
the funds necessary to keep working on it.

397
00:22:30,898 --> 00:22:34,040
And then we offered people like a small list of things

398
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,500
they could do to help.

399
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,402
They could write their favorite streamer about the game.

400
00:22:38,402 --> 00:22:40,223
They could retweet things.

401
00:22:40,223 --> 00:22:42,524
They could reach out to other influencers and press

402
00:22:42,524 --> 00:22:45,065
that they want to read about the game.

403
00:22:45,065 --> 00:22:45,905
And they went nuts.

404
00:22:45,905 --> 00:22:48,227
They put in so much effort into this.

405
00:22:48,227 --> 00:22:51,188
They wrote out hundreds, thousands of emails,

406
00:22:51,188 --> 00:22:52,889
reached out to so many people.

407
00:22:52,889 --> 00:22:54,770
It resulted in a lot of coverage,

408
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:56,751
which we would never have achieved on our own.

409
00:22:57,311 --> 00:23:02,315
And we actually managed to easily beat that goal because of them.

410
00:23:02,315 --> 00:23:04,397
And now they get more free updates.

411
00:23:04,397 --> 00:23:09,081
So it's always like a symbiotic relationship between you

412
00:23:09,081 --> 00:23:13,145
and your community that you should try to achieve.

413
00:23:13,145 --> 00:23:13,585
So let's sum this up.

414
00:23:13,585 --> 00:23:15,707
So you create a game.

415
00:23:15,707 --> 00:23:18,049
First of all, you create a game with hooks.

416
00:23:18,049 --> 00:23:22,033
Then you try to find interested people.

417
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:23,915
You bring them together.

418
00:23:25,207 --> 00:23:31,272
You treat them well, you grow together, then you rock.

419
00:23:31,272 --> 00:23:39,579
And hopefully, Indie Game Guy will have a super happy, healthy community and a lot more

420
00:23:39,579 --> 00:23:42,201
games that he can work on in the future.

421
00:23:42,201 --> 00:23:42,541
Thank you.

422
00:23:51,973 --> 00:23:53,414
So if you have a question for Philomena,

423
00:23:53,414 --> 00:23:57,476
please come up to one of the mics in the aisles.

424
00:23:57,476 --> 00:23:59,617
And while we're waiting, I have a question for you.

425
00:23:59,617 --> 00:24:02,419
So were you the only one working on community things

426
00:24:02,419 --> 00:24:04,079
on the team or was it a whole team effort

427
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:05,680
or did you have somebody else doing it?

428
00:24:06,627 --> 00:24:09,109
It was mostly me.

429
00:24:09,109 --> 00:24:16,333
Some of our team members sometimes jumped in, especially on specific platforms where they were maybe more used to, such as Reddit.

430
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:18,294
But yes, it was mostly me.

431
00:24:18,294 --> 00:24:21,856
You can do it. You can still be a game developer.

432
00:24:22,696 --> 00:24:26,177
actually get some work done and manage your community if you do it smart.

433
00:24:26,177 --> 00:24:33,478
Especially if it's growing bigger, you just have to give up more responsibility and give more responsibility

434
00:24:33,478 --> 00:24:40,820
to your moderators and show them if you are really needed how they should contact you and if you're not needed how they can handle

435
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,400
the situation themselves.

436
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:48,901
So it has actually, even though the community has grown a lot bigger, the effort has not grown with it because you can give it

437
00:24:48,901 --> 00:24:49,801
to people that care.

438
00:24:52,197 --> 00:24:52,618
Hi.

439
00:24:52,618 --> 00:24:54,440
Hello?

440
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,981
Is this on?

441
00:24:55,981 --> 00:24:56,462
Yep.

442
00:24:56,462 --> 00:24:56,942
OK, cool.

443
00:24:56,942 --> 00:24:58,304
Just making sure.

444
00:24:58,304 --> 00:25:01,267
So when cultivating your community,

445
00:25:01,267 --> 00:25:04,511
did you find certain platforms doing better than others?

446
00:25:04,511 --> 00:25:09,656
And based on what platform, did you, I guess,

447
00:25:09,656 --> 00:25:10,757
kind of tailor?

448
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:17,101
how you, I guess, worked with the community

449
00:25:17,101 --> 00:25:18,261
based on the platform.

450
00:25:18,261 --> 00:25:22,222
Like, what, like, how much are the platforms, like,

451
00:25:22,222 --> 00:25:25,723
changing based on how you approach your communities?

452
00:25:25,723 --> 00:25:28,224
So, you mean how to choose your platform

453
00:25:28,224 --> 00:25:29,444
for the community hub?

454
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:30,565
Where to bring them?

455
00:25:30,705 --> 00:25:34,127
Yeah, like Reddit versus Discord versus Forum.

456
00:25:34,127 --> 00:25:35,168
Depends on the game.

457
00:25:35,168 --> 00:25:37,670
For example, with Niche, our target audience

458
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,251
seemed to be a lot more on Facebook,

459
00:25:39,251 --> 00:25:42,133
and they greatly appreciated the Facebook group.

460
00:25:42,133 --> 00:25:44,215
They were not so much on Reddit.

461
00:25:44,215 --> 00:25:47,517
For Nimbatus, it's mostly Reddit and Discord.

462
00:25:47,517 --> 00:25:49,739
So I think you can just start up anywhere

463
00:25:49,739 --> 00:25:51,320
and see where it sticks most,

464
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,722
and then choose this as your main hub.

465
00:25:53,722 --> 00:25:54,983
Cool, thank you.

466
00:25:54,983 --> 00:25:55,163
Cool.

467
00:26:00,203 --> 00:26:06,428
I know that you were saying that it took a while for you to get to the point where you

468
00:26:06,428 --> 00:26:12,212
were, I guess you were handling all of the social media, but how often were you updating

469
00:26:12,212 --> 00:26:14,914
each individual branch of that?

470
00:26:14,914 --> 00:26:16,895
How often were you checking it?

471
00:26:16,895 --> 00:26:17,916
How much time were you spending?

472
00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:24,194
You mean how much we updated which social media channel?

473
00:26:24,194 --> 00:26:25,435
Exactly.

474
00:26:25,435 --> 00:26:27,716
Depended a lot on where we actually were in the game.

475
00:26:27,716 --> 00:26:29,978
So what we're trying to do with the company

476
00:26:29,978 --> 00:26:32,861
is that everyone who is working on the game

477
00:26:32,861 --> 00:26:34,622
and comes across something interesting,

478
00:26:34,622 --> 00:26:35,042
they just like.

479
00:26:35,583 --> 00:26:38,125
hit screen record real quick, put it in a folder,

480
00:26:38,125 --> 00:26:40,347
and I can go from there.

481
00:26:40,347 --> 00:26:43,810
While we are not in an intensive marketing cycle,

482
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:46,452
such as close to launch, we usually

483
00:26:46,452 --> 00:26:50,215
update like two or three times a week.

484
00:26:50,215 --> 00:26:52,237
And usually it only makes sense to update

485
00:26:52,237 --> 00:26:54,438
if you have something interesting to show.

486
00:26:54,438 --> 00:26:55,900
So sometimes there is a week where

487
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:56,820
there's not much going on.

488
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:59,683
And sometimes we have like, we're on the roll

489
00:26:59,683 --> 00:27:01,184
and we put out a lot of stuff.

490
00:27:01,184 --> 00:27:02,185
Yeah.

491
00:27:02,185 --> 00:27:02,965
No real rule there.

492
00:27:02,965 --> 00:27:03,146
Sure.

493
00:27:04,717 --> 00:27:06,598
Hi, are you still actively updating Niche?

494
00:27:06,598 --> 00:27:09,400
Is that still like an active development?

495
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:09,601
It is?

496
00:27:09,601 --> 00:27:12,203
Okay, because I have a question about how do you handle

497
00:27:12,203 --> 00:27:14,284
as like in the slower periods of development

498
00:27:14,284 --> 00:27:16,006
or when you begin to sort of stop,

499
00:27:16,006 --> 00:27:17,627
cease development on a title?

500
00:27:17,627 --> 00:27:19,709
Do you have any plans for how to sort of

501
00:27:19,709 --> 00:27:21,410
maintain community engagement

502
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:23,111
as you are say working on the next product?

503
00:27:24,085 --> 00:27:29,927
Yes, so with Niche, we're working on it one day a week still, making some updates.

504
00:27:29,927 --> 00:27:35,629
And how we handle it is that we like, every few months we do a community voting.

505
00:27:35,629 --> 00:27:38,810
So they can make, so the whole year they can make suggestions.

506
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:42,351
And then at some point, we say, OK, this and this and this

507
00:27:42,351 --> 00:27:44,932
and this would be possible to add to the game.

508
00:27:44,932 --> 00:27:46,832
And then we announce it, like, now you

509
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:48,032
can vote on new features.

510
00:27:48,032 --> 00:27:51,373
And then they jump on that and vote on their favorite features

511
00:27:51,373 --> 00:27:53,234
and talk about it, why this would be better

512
00:27:53,234 --> 00:27:54,274
or that would be better.

513
00:27:54,274 --> 00:27:55,934
And then we add that to the game.

514
00:27:55,934 --> 00:27:58,895
But development has slowed down a lot recently.

515
00:27:58,895 --> 00:28:01,035
So before, we were working on it full time.

516
00:28:01,035 --> 00:28:02,676
Now it's only one day a week.

517
00:28:02,676 --> 00:28:05,176
But still, because they can discuss what would be best

518
00:28:05,176 --> 00:28:06,637
and really what should we suggest

519
00:28:06,637 --> 00:28:08,297
for the next community update, they're

520
00:28:08,297 --> 00:28:09,177
still very much there.

521
00:28:11,419 --> 00:28:17,783
How much longer are you going to do it?

522
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,981
Yes, to some extent.

523
00:28:31,981 --> 00:28:35,304
So we know a bit of where the traffic is coming from, from

524
00:28:35,304 --> 00:28:38,507
what, and we often hear, for example, if we have a big

525
00:28:38,507 --> 00:28:41,229
YouTuber or streamer playing it, they say, yeah, I'm

526
00:28:41,229 --> 00:28:44,372
streaming this because a lot of people have requested it,

527
00:28:44,372 --> 00:28:46,794
not because we reached out to them or something.

528
00:28:46,794 --> 00:28:51,378
So we see where the community actually is taking effect.

529
00:28:51,378 --> 00:28:54,120
But we are not doing super in-depth analysis.

530
00:28:56,250 --> 00:29:02,932
Sure. Do you see that because Facebook and Reddit and Discord are such open platforms,

531
00:29:02,932 --> 00:29:07,734
users can create their own communities, do you see that happening a lot too? That users and

532
00:29:07,734 --> 00:29:13,016
players are actually creating their own communities? And if so, how do you see that

533
00:29:13,016 --> 00:29:15,797
ecosystem working with your official community?

534
00:29:16,899 --> 00:29:23,045
question. Yeah, that actually happens quite a lot. And sometimes you just see that people

535
00:29:23,045 --> 00:29:27,408
are nice to each other, it seems to work on their own. Sometimes you want to maybe talk

536
00:29:27,408 --> 00:29:33,113
to the moderators about how they could maybe improve things. But most of the communities,

537
00:29:33,113 --> 00:29:36,756
at least for Niche, were opened up by the community itself.

538
00:29:37,277 --> 00:29:40,580
And again, some of the backbone members

539
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,842
were the ones who opened them.

540
00:29:41,842 --> 00:29:44,164
So they sometimes even informed us that,

541
00:29:44,164 --> 00:29:45,886
hey, I want to open a subreddit.

542
00:29:45,886 --> 00:29:47,468
And I'm like, yeah, sure.

543
00:29:47,468 --> 00:29:49,410
Because I know that this person already knows

544
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:52,714
what we're trying to have in terms of values.

545
00:29:53,234 --> 00:29:57,479
So, but if it's not going well, just try to reach out to the moderator and see.

546
00:29:57,479 --> 00:30:02,344
And if it's totally not going well, then you can still think about opening an official

547
00:30:02,344 --> 00:30:05,288
niche subreddit and like, this is not the thing.

548
00:30:05,288 --> 00:30:06,249
This is the real thing.

549
00:30:06,249 --> 00:30:07,230
If you want to.

550
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:07,510
Cool.

551
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,591
Thank you.

552
00:30:11,718 --> 00:30:16,982
Hi, yeah, my question is, you did mention a lot of your game revolves around community building.

553
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:21,366
And how do you guys deal when the community itself starts becoming very toxic?

554
00:30:21,366 --> 00:30:24,569
And do you guys just drop the band hammer?

555
00:30:26,149 --> 00:30:28,010
Yeah, we have banned some people.

556
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:32,252
It doesn't happen so often if you warn people about what you...

557
00:30:32,252 --> 00:30:35,653
Like, if you just tell them what's the rules in this thing

558
00:30:35,653 --> 00:30:37,954
and not try to correct their characters.

559
00:30:37,954 --> 00:30:39,314
You can be an asshole, that's fine,

560
00:30:39,314 --> 00:30:41,415
but please don't be an asshole in here.

561
00:30:41,415 --> 00:30:42,796
These are the rules.

562
00:30:42,796 --> 00:30:44,636
Then they usually listen to it.

563
00:30:44,636 --> 00:30:46,637
Even if there's some pretty bad trolls,

564
00:30:46,637 --> 00:30:48,558
we had to ban some people, though.

565
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:51,379
And usually then that's the good idea to just...

566
00:30:51,379 --> 00:30:51,479
Yeah.

567
00:30:51,479 --> 00:30:52,099
Cool, thank you.
