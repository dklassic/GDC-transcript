1
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:07,151
Hello.

2
00:00:07,151 --> 00:00:08,712
Hello, everyone.

3
00:00:08,712 --> 00:00:13,094
Welcome to the little dab of spice, of African spice,

4
00:00:13,094 --> 00:00:14,695
to this whole conference.

5
00:00:14,695 --> 00:00:17,977
It's only available here.

6
00:00:17,977 --> 00:00:20,758
So good job on coming.

7
00:00:21,371 --> 00:00:24,013
We, hello, I'm Ben, as he mentioned.

8
00:00:24,013 --> 00:00:26,454
I do game design and marketing at Nyamakop,

9
00:00:26,454 --> 00:00:28,716
a South African-based independent game studio,

10
00:00:28,716 --> 00:00:31,798
which I co-founded with the very lovely and handsome man over here.

11
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:33,119
Hi, I'm Sugar.

12
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:36,501
I'm the business and technical side of Nyamakop.

13
00:00:36,501 --> 00:00:39,383
Some say the one with more swag, but it's debatable.

14
00:00:39,383 --> 00:00:39,703
It's hurtful.

15
00:00:39,703 --> 00:00:40,203
It's hurtful.

16
00:00:40,203 --> 00:00:42,945
We released our debut game, Semblance, in July 2018.

17
00:00:42,945 --> 00:00:48,909
Sugar and I founded the studio straight out of university

18
00:00:48,909 --> 00:00:51,150
with no real-world work experience.

19
00:00:51,537 --> 00:00:53,398
in games or otherwise.

20
00:00:53,398 --> 00:00:56,580
It's a puzzle platformer where the world is made of Play-Doh,

21
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,202
as you can see, and when we're feeling bold,

22
00:00:59,202 --> 00:01:03,945
which is often, we call it the first true platformer.

23
00:01:03,945 --> 00:01:06,646
Because you can move the platforms.

24
00:01:06,646 --> 00:01:09,708
We have a very long linguistic spiel joke.

25
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:10,909
Lots of journalists have heard it.

26
00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:13,030
I'm not going to enact that on you.

27
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,852
So this talk kind of centers around the idea

28
00:01:15,852 --> 00:01:19,514
of breaking into indie games in 2019.

29
00:01:20,047 --> 00:01:24,428
When we started making Semblance, it was, I guess, our goal to break in, right?

30
00:01:24,428 --> 00:01:31,170
At the beginning, we had assumptions and internalized ideas about what it was like to make games.

31
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:36,312
And this was drawn mainly from public perception and cultures surrounding independent games.

32
00:01:36,312 --> 00:01:41,273
Those assumptions were often wrong, and following them blindly would have left us in a...

33
00:01:41,731 --> 00:01:46,192
a very bad place and probably wouldn't be able to do this talk right now.

34
00:01:46,192 --> 00:01:51,614
So we wanted to give this talk, sharing our journey into indie games from South Africa

35
00:01:51,614 --> 00:01:55,516
and how we made decisions to be able to make more than one game, pretty much.

36
00:01:55,516 --> 00:02:00,377
And hopefully this talk can be used by first-time creators to get insight into what it's like

37
00:02:00,377 --> 00:02:04,559
to try to break into indie games in 2019 and also help fellow African creators trying to

38
00:02:04,559 --> 00:02:05,199
do the same.

39
00:02:05,199 --> 00:02:10,941
So here are some of the assumptions we had when we started making Semblance.

40
00:02:11,781 --> 00:02:16,123
We were going to build this huge fan base.

41
00:02:16,123 --> 00:02:20,705
We were going to get great preview coverage,

42
00:02:20,705 --> 00:02:26,408
get selected for awards and exhibitions,

43
00:02:26,408 --> 00:02:30,189
get a publisher, get big YouTubers playing our game,

44
00:02:30,189 --> 00:02:30,790
and just sit back.

45
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:31,990
And then our amazing work be found.

46
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,711
And on release, amazing reviews, tons of money,

47
00:02:33,711 --> 00:02:36,893
and recoup in the first month or week.

48
00:02:36,893 --> 00:02:37,613
It was going to be great.

49
00:02:37,613 --> 00:02:39,614
It was going to be beautiful.

50
00:02:39,614 --> 00:02:40,914
Let's look at how we did.

51
00:02:40,914 --> 00:02:41,435
So we had

52
00:02:41,818 --> 00:02:45,219
copious and high quality preview coverage from media outlets

53
00:02:45,219 --> 00:02:46,880
during development, including all these ones

54
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,800
and various others.

55
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,481
The game was selected for one to two dozen exhibitions

56
00:02:51,481 --> 00:02:53,221
all over the world during development,

57
00:02:53,221 --> 00:02:55,262
including places like South by Southwest, The Maze,

58
00:02:55,262 --> 00:02:57,202
and PAX East.

59
00:02:57,202 --> 00:02:59,003
We won some awards, the Excellence in Game Design

60
00:02:59,003 --> 00:03:00,623
Award at BitSummit, and were nominated

61
00:03:00,623 --> 00:03:02,684
for various others over the years.

62
00:03:02,684 --> 00:03:04,604
Also when we accepted awards, people

63
00:03:04,604 --> 00:03:06,405
stared at Sugar's biceps.

64
00:03:06,405 --> 00:03:07,845
He's wearing long sleeves today.

65
00:03:07,845 --> 00:03:08,965
Thank you for your sacrifice, Sugar.

66
00:03:08,965 --> 00:03:09,385
Thank you.

67
00:03:10,325 --> 00:03:12,326
We also signed with a lovely publisher,

68
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:13,267
Good Shepherd Entertainment.

69
00:03:13,267 --> 00:03:15,968
They helped us go from this tiny mini booth

70
00:03:15,968 --> 00:03:17,089
at PAX East 2017 on the left

71
00:03:17,089 --> 00:03:20,731
to this giant branded semblance booth

72
00:03:20,731 --> 00:03:23,974
with branded stress balls and beanbags at PAX East 2018.

73
00:03:23,974 --> 00:03:26,735
Generally, they just helped the quality production

74
00:03:26,735 --> 00:03:27,736
go up a lot.

75
00:03:27,736 --> 00:03:29,958
And then our game got featured by Nintendo twice

76
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:33,500
and upon launch, we became the first African-developed IP

77
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,981
to ever release on Nintendo platform.

78
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:36,142
So that was cool.

79
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:40,409
When we shipped, this is a live stream of our tweet deck

80
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:41,710
during the launch hours.

81
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,891
It was a lot of activity.

82
00:03:42,891 --> 00:03:46,354
And reviews, our reviews were pretty good.

83
00:03:46,354 --> 00:03:49,297
We're currently ranked as the 68th best PC game

84
00:03:49,297 --> 00:03:49,978
of 2018 on Metacritic.

85
00:03:50,544 --> 00:03:52,185
and I have no idea how they worked this out,

86
00:03:52,185 --> 00:03:55,307
but the 32nd most shared Switch game of 2018.

87
00:03:55,307 --> 00:03:57,207
We had a million social media impressions

88
00:03:57,207 --> 00:03:58,328
during our launch month.

89
00:03:58,328 --> 00:04:00,089
We were new and trending in Steam.

90
00:04:00,089 --> 00:04:02,790
We had about 14 million impressions up until now

91
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,932
on our Steam page and a few hundred thousand visits.

92
00:04:05,932 --> 00:04:08,653
We had no Nintendo launch feature though.

93
00:04:08,653 --> 00:04:12,475
And games as a service really sucks.

94
00:04:12,475 --> 00:04:15,077
We announced four weeks before we were gonna launch.

95
00:04:15,077 --> 00:04:16,097
This is when we're launching.

96
00:04:16,424 --> 00:04:20,086
And a week before, this game, No Man's Sky, was like, yo,

97
00:04:20,086 --> 00:04:21,306
we're coming back.

98
00:04:21,306 --> 00:04:25,889
And the big update that changed that game's legacy

99
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:29,611
launched the same day, same time as us.

100
00:04:29,611 --> 00:04:33,773
And also some small indie games you probably haven't heard

101
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:37,054
of, Fortnite and GTA 5 Online, they updated their game

102
00:04:37,054 --> 00:04:38,475
as well, that was pretty minor.

103
00:04:38,475 --> 00:04:39,996
And now the sales, how did Semblance do sales-wise?

104
00:04:39,996 --> 00:04:41,637
Wow, listen to that silence in the room.

105
00:04:41,637 --> 00:04:43,718
Everyone's having flashbacks.

106
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,202
Indie games are dead.

107
00:04:47,202 --> 00:04:50,865
So PC, a few thousand users on Steam.

108
00:04:50,865 --> 00:04:54,027
After all that, on Switch, it's better.

109
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:56,289
Not a whole lot better, a multiple better.

110
00:04:56,289 --> 00:05:00,152
And we did not get rich.

111
00:05:00,152 --> 00:05:00,972
We have not yet recouped.

112
00:05:00,972 --> 00:05:01,313
It's very sad.

113
00:05:01,313 --> 00:05:05,336
And in case you're not familiar with published models, no

114
00:05:05,336 --> 00:05:09,699
recoup means no semblance of sales money has come to us

115
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:09,959
yet.

116
00:05:10,596 --> 00:05:14,359
We don't see Semblance is dead, though.

117
00:05:14,359 --> 00:05:16,200
It's less than a year since the game has been released.

118
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,062
We have a couple tens of thousands wishlists on Steam

119
00:05:19,062 --> 00:05:21,864
still, and we're working with our publisher

120
00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:24,706
to look at other deals and avenues for the game

121
00:05:24,706 --> 00:05:26,447
to recoup in the future.

122
00:05:26,447 --> 00:05:28,289
But, I mean, obviously, the game didn't sell.

123
00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:30,010
Like, how are we still alive?

124
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,451
How is it possible?

125
00:05:31,451 --> 00:05:34,453
And we're still here working on projects.

126
00:05:34,453 --> 00:05:36,034
And like, Semblance could have been a game that

127
00:05:36,775 --> 00:05:39,077
could have been better in a swathe of ways.

128
00:05:39,077 --> 00:05:40,919
You can look back at any game you launch and like,

129
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:41,940
ah, could have been better this way.

130
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,761
It was so better if we did this,

131
00:05:43,761 --> 00:05:45,463
all those sort of things, right?

132
00:05:45,463 --> 00:05:47,265
It's like hard to retrospectively do that.

133
00:05:47,265 --> 00:05:49,066
But what you can definitely do

134
00:05:49,066 --> 00:05:51,168
is try and leverage your development time

135
00:05:51,168 --> 00:05:52,689
in perhaps lateral ways to ensure

136
00:05:52,689 --> 00:05:54,091
you can continue making games,

137
00:05:54,091 --> 00:05:55,632
which is what we want to talk about today.

138
00:05:55,632 --> 00:05:58,675
And we say lateral because these goals and decisions

139
00:05:58,675 --> 00:06:01,337
might not necessarily help your debut game perform better.

140
00:06:01,337 --> 00:06:03,038
Sometimes you might even conflict with that.

141
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:05,600
it might enable you to make another game.

142
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,722
And sometimes those actual goals will help you

143
00:06:07,722 --> 00:06:08,562
with your current game.

144
00:06:08,562 --> 00:06:10,744
I always like to say, quite cynically,

145
00:06:10,744 --> 00:06:12,525
the best creative integrity is being

146
00:06:12,525 --> 00:06:14,466
able to make another game.

147
00:06:14,466 --> 00:06:18,049
For more experienced folks, some of this process

148
00:06:18,049 --> 00:06:18,849
will be old hat.

149
00:06:18,849 --> 00:06:20,731
But for debut creators like us, we

150
00:06:20,731 --> 00:06:23,973
have to learn a lot of it and actively decide to pursue it.

151
00:06:23,973 --> 00:06:25,714
So we think it's crucial for.

152
00:06:26,402 --> 00:06:31,208
particularly new creators looking to make their first commercial indie game to understand some of this stuff.

153
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:35,513
And really, like I mentioned earlier, we came across this because the writing's on the wall.

154
00:06:35,513 --> 00:06:38,637
It's hard to avoid all this news and social media stuff about games.

155
00:06:38,637 --> 00:06:41,040
Great ones not always selling well.

156
00:06:41,967 --> 00:06:44,008
And we also saw from researching and talking to people

157
00:06:44,008 --> 00:06:48,511
that debut games, newcomer debut games, rarely do well.

158
00:06:48,511 --> 00:06:50,253
And by newcomer we mean here people

159
00:06:50,253 --> 00:06:53,395
who have no real world experience, work experience.

160
00:06:53,395 --> 00:06:55,577
Debut games by people from other industries

161
00:06:55,577 --> 00:06:57,918
who come into games perform better.

162
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,060
But if you look at games that have come out

163
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,562
and done well from debut, it's like one a year,

164
00:07:02,562 --> 00:07:03,483
maybe two a year.

165
00:07:03,483 --> 00:07:06,645
Your Diane Wells in 2015, Events Zero in 2016,

166
00:07:06,645 --> 00:07:09,707
The Haunted Island, Frog Detective Game in 2018,

167
00:07:09,707 --> 00:07:11,448
and Sardau Valley.

168
00:07:11,671 --> 00:07:14,233
which kind of destroys this whole metaphor.

169
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:14,513
But it's fine.

170
00:07:14,513 --> 00:07:14,613
Yeah.

171
00:07:14,613 --> 00:07:16,274
But it is very rare that debut games do well.

172
00:07:16,274 --> 00:07:17,755
It's just how it is.

173
00:07:17,755 --> 00:07:22,138
And so what we want to do is look at the lateral pillars

174
00:07:22,138 --> 00:07:22,959
of breaking in.

175
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,960
And these are what they are.

176
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,821
You've got to be ready to succeed, prepared to fail.

177
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:31,625
You've got to redefine your metrics of success.

178
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:34,427
You have to have a long-term vision.

179
00:07:34,427 --> 00:07:37,529
You have to be visible, be reputable.

180
00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:39,270
You have to learn and apply it rapidly.

181
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,811
And you have to carve a contextual.

182
00:07:41,597 --> 00:07:44,459
And now, Sugar, will take you through the timeline

183
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:47,181
of Semblance development and how we implemented

184
00:07:47,181 --> 00:07:49,143
those lateral pillars.

185
00:07:49,143 --> 00:07:49,383
Yeah.

186
00:07:49,383 --> 00:07:54,127
So like Ben said, we had a few lateral pillars

187
00:07:54,127 --> 00:07:56,649
that we used throughout development

188
00:07:56,649 --> 00:07:59,631
to kind of guide the way we were making decisions

189
00:07:59,631 --> 00:08:01,873
and how we were going to break into the industry.

190
00:08:03,145 --> 00:08:08,328
Semnus really started in 2015, and it started as a university

191
00:08:08,328 --> 00:08:11,830
project that quickly turned into a commercial

192
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:14,112
entity and company.

193
00:08:14,112 --> 00:08:17,654
And at the time, the game looked like this.

194
00:08:17,654 --> 00:08:19,655
The date in the GIF is wrong.

195
00:08:19,655 --> 00:08:21,776
But the game looked like this at the time.

196
00:08:21,776 --> 00:08:25,939
And when we were presenting the game at university, one of

197
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:30,022
our external examiners, after the presentation, turns to us

198
00:08:30,022 --> 00:08:30,642
and says, hey.

199
00:08:31,074 --> 00:08:32,494
The game looks kind of interesting.

200
00:08:32,494 --> 00:08:35,335
Why don't you guys make it into a commercial project?

201
00:08:35,335 --> 00:08:38,636
And at that time, that external examiner

202
00:08:38,636 --> 00:08:42,296
was an ex-Naughty Dog developer, Judd Samanthoff,

203
00:08:42,296 --> 00:08:44,037
who worked on some of the titles like The Last of Us.

204
00:08:44,037 --> 00:08:47,337
So we thought it was a pretty good sign

205
00:08:47,337 --> 00:08:51,438
to just go ahead and work on this thing as a real thing.

206
00:08:51,438 --> 00:08:54,939
It was always our dreams to be indie developers as well.

207
00:08:55,653 --> 00:09:00,716
So we put the project on ice, took it out of university,

208
00:09:00,716 --> 00:09:04,137
and kind of finished doing university through 2015.

209
00:09:04,137 --> 00:09:07,979
And even as early as then, we knew

210
00:09:07,979 --> 00:09:09,620
one of the first things we needed to do

211
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,581
was to learn about the industry, learn about how

212
00:09:12,581 --> 00:09:13,662
to make commercial games.

213
00:09:13,662 --> 00:09:16,123
We read everything we could find on Gamasutra,

214
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:19,644
watched YouTube videos from GDC, and tried

215
00:09:19,644 --> 00:09:22,065
to apply those learnings as quickly as possible.

216
00:09:22,165 --> 00:09:25,427
And later through the development, we also wanted to be,

217
00:09:25,427 --> 00:09:27,627
we got access into sharing communities

218
00:09:27,627 --> 00:09:29,808
like the Indie Megabooth mailing list

219
00:09:29,808 --> 00:09:33,810
and part of the Indie Games residency program, Stoogan.

220
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:37,631
And so learning was always a very important part

221
00:09:37,631 --> 00:09:38,371
of our journey.

222
00:09:39,415 --> 00:09:43,341
come in 2016 and now we got, we finished university

223
00:09:43,341 --> 00:09:45,684
and we're ready to jump into the project,

224
00:09:45,684 --> 00:09:47,567
really hit the road running.

225
00:09:47,567 --> 00:09:50,973
But we were trying to build a game,

226
00:09:50,973 --> 00:09:54,558
form a team with no dollar, no cash money.

227
00:09:55,205 --> 00:09:58,727
And the way it kind of looks from our perspective in South

228
00:09:58,727 --> 00:10:01,868
Africa is that we can't even look at things like Kickstarter.

229
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:04,109
We can't run a Kickstarter because you

230
00:10:04,109 --> 00:10:07,111
have to have a bank account that's not from South Africa.

231
00:10:07,111 --> 00:10:09,352
So that's off the table.

232
00:10:09,352 --> 00:10:12,433
The government, not quite sure what

233
00:10:12,433 --> 00:10:14,134
video games are at the moment.

234
00:10:14,134 --> 00:10:17,876
At that time, though, they know it makes a lot of money,

235
00:10:17,876 --> 00:10:19,276
but yeah, it's whatever.

236
00:10:19,276 --> 00:10:22,338
In fact, to submit your game for ratings by South Africa,

237
00:10:22,338 --> 00:10:24,119
you have to turn it in by VHS.

238
00:10:24,979 --> 00:10:27,381
because it's under movies.

239
00:10:27,381 --> 00:10:29,723
So it's a bit, it's a tricky situation there.

240
00:10:29,723 --> 00:10:32,785
And local investors into the game space,

241
00:10:32,785 --> 00:10:34,647
a few and far between.

242
00:10:34,647 --> 00:10:36,848
So that was always a tricky thing.

243
00:10:36,848 --> 00:10:40,371
And because of no money to fund the team,

244
00:10:40,371 --> 00:10:42,553
and you know, as kids growing up,

245
00:10:42,553 --> 00:10:45,435
we couldn't really, there were in.

246
00:10:46,255 --> 00:10:48,997
mismatch of commitment levels within the team,

247
00:10:48,997 --> 00:10:52,218
and that caused the game to not really develop that much

248
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:55,760
haphazardly throughout 2016.

249
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,020
But we kept going forward,

250
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:58,801
and in mid of 2016,

251
00:10:58,801 --> 00:11:02,062
we found the deformation mechanic.

252
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:05,464
And this was kind of what was making the game interesting,

253
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:07,585
because up until then,

254
00:11:07,585 --> 00:11:10,306
it was about a character changing shape and size.

255
00:11:10,486 --> 00:11:15,152
And so we continued developing, the art style got a bit better,

256
00:11:15,152 --> 00:11:18,696
but the funding situation was still keeping us back.

257
00:11:18,696 --> 00:11:21,039
So towards the end of 2016, we decided,

258
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:24,744
hey, let's scrounge up a few pennies from under the couch

259
00:11:24,744 --> 00:11:27,707
and fund an artist to help us create

260
00:11:27,707 --> 00:11:29,269
the visual style of the game.

261
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,175
that it is sort of today.

262
00:11:32,175 --> 00:11:34,657
And the idea was so that we could

263
00:11:34,657 --> 00:11:38,019
use that little bit of money and then pitch it to a publisher,

264
00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:39,600
and all our problems would be solved.

265
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,342
But at that time, since all the publishers

266
00:11:43,342 --> 00:11:46,164
we could get a hold of, everyone was like.

267
00:11:46,565 --> 00:11:49,907
Yeah, the mechanic's cool, but it's just not there yet.

268
00:11:49,907 --> 00:11:52,689
In fact, one of the publishers even came back to us and said,

269
00:11:52,689 --> 00:11:55,630
this looks like art of a student project.

270
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:58,392
That's ironic, because we had just paid an artist

271
00:11:58,392 --> 00:11:59,793
to work on the game.

272
00:11:59,793 --> 00:12:02,315
But we kept working on it.

273
00:12:02,535 --> 00:12:09,117
made a little plan and we found one of those rare local investors to give us a bit of money

274
00:12:09,117 --> 00:12:10,057
to make this game.

275
00:12:10,057 --> 00:12:14,659
And at the time it was still small dreams to just release on itch, but we kept working

276
00:12:14,659 --> 00:12:18,080
on it with a bit more money and got an artist on board full time.

277
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:26,543
And so like with these lateral pillars as well, we try to use them in a way to inform

278
00:12:26,543 --> 00:12:28,543
production and design decisions as well.

279
00:12:28,978 --> 00:12:31,480
like semblance that are forming terrain mechanic is very deep.

280
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,302
There's like a lot you can do with it.

281
00:12:33,302 --> 00:12:37,125
But we decided to like rather than make like,

282
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:41,128
you know, a five-year project very in vogue with indie games,

283
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:42,810
we decided to cut a lot of features

284
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:45,452
like this beautiful jiggly pink platform.

285
00:12:45,452 --> 00:12:46,833
I miss it so much. It's so bouncy.

286
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,154
Like and a lot of games do this, right?

287
00:12:48,154 --> 00:12:51,637
But we were very aggressive about the scope,

288
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:53,859
like cutting features and ideas

289
00:12:53,859 --> 00:12:56,762
and really making it as small as we possibly could.

290
00:12:57,159 --> 00:13:02,122
And this helped also with funding, because two inexperienced kids from Africa, it seems

291
00:13:02,122 --> 00:13:06,884
like a Nigerian hack email being like, please give us this money.

292
00:13:06,884 --> 00:13:07,725
It's ridiculous.

293
00:13:07,725 --> 00:13:12,868
But with the cost of living in South Africa being way cheaper than other parts of the

294
00:13:12,868 --> 00:13:18,931
world and us having a very small-scoped game, it was way easier for a publisher or investor

295
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:21,953
to be like, OK, the risk-reward is quite good here.

296
00:13:22,414 --> 00:13:24,995
And then we spent a lot of time making sure the game just

297
00:13:24,995 --> 00:13:26,376
like stood out really well.

298
00:13:26,376 --> 00:13:28,938
And this was active in terms of the long-term vision.

299
00:13:28,938 --> 00:13:32,841
We literally looked through Steam and all these places

300
00:13:32,841 --> 00:13:35,603
and were like, what colors aren't people using?

301
00:13:35,603 --> 00:13:36,664
There was a lot of brown.

302
00:13:36,664 --> 00:13:37,784
There was a lot of brown.

303
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:39,446
Triple A games do like brown.

304
00:13:39,446 --> 00:13:42,128
Yeah. So we were like, let's do pink and purple.

305
00:13:42,128 --> 00:13:45,330
Yeah. It sounds banal, but it was a real decision we made.

306
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:46,791
And it helps it stand out.

307
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,372
And then like Sugar said, like finding

308
00:13:48,372 --> 00:13:50,253
that interesting mechanic of the deforming terrain.

309
00:13:50,253 --> 00:13:51,074
Here's another one.

310
00:13:52,093 --> 00:13:54,254
And then in 2017, there's two parts to 2017.

311
00:13:54,254 --> 00:13:56,514
The first is when we're still self-publishing.

312
00:13:56,514 --> 00:13:59,195
At this point, our goal was to go everywhere

313
00:13:59,195 --> 00:14:01,355
and gain international exposure.

314
00:14:01,355 --> 00:14:03,176
We paid ourselves in exposure, it's true.

315
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:07,237
And this pillar and this part was be visible

316
00:14:07,237 --> 00:14:08,277
and be reputable.

317
00:14:08,277 --> 00:14:11,278
In terms of the African perspective,

318
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:12,718
the market is quite big.

319
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:14,978
Like, people in Africa spend money on video games,

320
00:14:14,978 --> 00:14:17,539
but the amount that goes to local creators is...

321
00:14:17,926 --> 00:14:22,268
like so small. So it's very hard to survive selling directly to the African

322
00:14:22,268 --> 00:14:25,589
market at the moment. So as a result, you have to sell to the West, which means

323
00:14:25,589 --> 00:14:30,031
you have to travel to find that market. You have to make sure to meet journalists

324
00:14:30,031 --> 00:14:33,492
and publishers and funders and platform holders and other developers in the West

325
00:14:33,492 --> 00:14:37,994
because very few of them have representatives on like the continent.

326
00:14:37,994 --> 00:14:41,656
It's almost a billion people, but they're like, it's fine.

327
00:14:41,656 --> 00:14:42,396
You don't. That's not important.

328
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,382
And it's not easy to travel because of visas, how long it takes, money.

329
00:14:46,382 --> 00:14:48,924
Travel is far and eats into development time.

330
00:14:48,924 --> 00:14:52,587
And for us, we still made that decision to be seen and to be known.

331
00:14:52,587 --> 00:14:56,329
Doing talks like right now, being at events, being on Twitter, just

332
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:59,231
taking up a little bit of mind share so that people knew about us.

333
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:02,254
Submitting to like exhibitions and awards all the time.

334
00:15:02,254 --> 00:15:05,076
We actively try to make people know about us.

335
00:15:05,076 --> 00:15:09,038
And a lot of this was, you know, gaining a reputation and prestige so that we could.

336
00:15:09,439 --> 00:15:12,822
point to stuff in future to prove you weren't just two inexperienced African kids out of

337
00:15:12,822 --> 00:15:15,884
university you should give money to, which you still are.

338
00:15:15,884 --> 00:15:20,668
But instead, we can now say we're also award-winning game developers of the top 100 Metacritic

339
00:15:20,668 --> 00:15:21,088
video game.

340
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:25,652
And those things might not necessarily have made the game sell better, but they helped

341
00:15:25,652 --> 00:15:26,993
us in future with the reputation.

342
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:36,160
And so as part of this, thanks to Train Jam's scholarship, we went to our first GDC in 2017,

343
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,062
which is where we pitched Nintendo in the corner of a park.

344
00:15:39,558 --> 00:15:42,359
with the sun out, I'd use my body to shield it.

345
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:43,900
I don't think you can even see the video,

346
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,700
he was like, yeah, it's fine.

347
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,762
And then right after this, we went to PAX, met Xbox,

348
00:15:47,762 --> 00:15:49,763
and this was really the first time

349
00:15:49,763 --> 00:15:52,184
we'd ever really been able to meet platform holders

350
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:54,805
because there was no other way to meet them.

351
00:15:54,805 --> 00:15:56,286
And at PAX East, we met Press, got covered,

352
00:15:56,286 --> 00:15:58,707
and met a bunch of publishers as well.

353
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:00,588
And what this really comes down to

354
00:16:00,588 --> 00:16:03,109
in terms of being visible and reputable

355
00:16:03,109 --> 00:16:05,930
is shooting your shots.

356
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,351
You just gotta take the opportunities

357
00:16:07,351 --> 00:16:08,871
and make things happen.

358
00:16:09,325 --> 00:16:12,886
When you're traveling from Saigon, it takes 24 hours on a plane to get to San Francisco

359
00:16:12,886 --> 00:16:17,867
or Los Angeles, so you're not just going to sit back and hope for the best.

360
00:16:17,867 --> 00:16:20,148
You're going to go out and get it.

361
00:16:20,148 --> 00:16:23,169
This is really typified, I think, by this GIF.

362
00:16:23,169 --> 00:16:29,590
This is me at E3 2018, an official Devolver Digital marketing material about to almost

363
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:33,831
kiss Nigel Lurie, one of the important people at Devolver Digital.

364
00:16:33,831 --> 00:16:39,013
We were in the middle of a meeting pitching Semblance, and it was like, okay, this is

365
00:16:39,548 --> 00:16:42,333
But it really, like this is what you have to do.

366
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,637
Like, it's really hard to get press at events, right?

367
00:16:44,637 --> 00:16:46,901
Because you just, some like no name.

368
00:16:46,901 --> 00:16:48,564
I probably shouldn't have just let this loop,

369
00:16:48,564 --> 00:16:51,489
but I have nothing else to show you on the slide, I'm sorry.

370
00:16:52,487 --> 00:16:55,148
Like, if you're going to, you can't book press at events

371
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:57,068
because no one's ever heard of you.

372
00:16:57,068 --> 00:17:01,389
So you see that like blaring yellow marker on their badge

373
00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:02,830
saying press, you just walk up to them

374
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,490
and try to get them to come play your game.

375
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,291
And you send those emails that might never get responses.

376
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,031
You just walk up to people.

377
00:17:09,031 --> 00:17:10,891
And what we did as well is just submit

378
00:17:10,891 --> 00:17:12,612
to everything we could find.

379
00:17:12,612 --> 00:17:15,332
Like every Google form we could find, we submitted.

380
00:17:15,332 --> 00:17:17,913
I have some beautiful rejection letters.

381
00:17:17,913 --> 00:17:18,913
I just store them all.

382
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:20,114
There's like dozens of them.

383
00:17:20,114 --> 00:17:20,914
It's lovely.

384
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,334
And then stuff like.

385
00:17:22,613 --> 00:17:25,716
the first true platformer as well, it's like so ridiculous,

386
00:17:25,716 --> 00:17:28,077
but no one's ever going to forget the time someone told them

387
00:17:28,077 --> 00:17:30,139
they were making the first true platformer.

388
00:17:30,139 --> 00:17:31,800
And it was quite intense.

389
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,721
We did 25 cities in five continents in 18 months,

390
00:17:33,721 --> 00:17:35,903
and at one point we did four continents in four weeks.

391
00:17:35,903 --> 00:17:40,026
Like, this is really the scale of how aggressively we chased this idea.

392
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:42,207
And, you know, stuff that's people have spoken about before,

393
00:17:42,207 --> 00:17:43,768
like sharing development.

394
00:17:44,217 --> 00:17:47,619
on Twitter. And for us, this was actually about reaching developers and press and platforms,

395
00:17:47,619 --> 00:17:51,262
not even necessarily players, because you could talk to them and be like, oh yeah, I

396
00:17:51,262 --> 00:17:54,724
saw this game on Twitter. This is like a really ugly gif of the game, but got an interesting

397
00:17:54,724 --> 00:17:59,308
mechanic and I got a few hundred retweets. And it's also just like interacting people

398
00:17:59,308 --> 00:18:04,611
with a personal level on Twitter. I had this like really ridiculous semi-viral tweet about

399
00:18:04,611 --> 00:18:09,775
me looking in pain, looking at someone play our game. And I booked, we booked press off

400
00:18:09,775 --> 00:18:12,517
this tweet. Like someone from GamesRadar quote tweeted and I was like.

401
00:18:12,998 --> 00:18:16,562
I've always wondered if game developers did this.

402
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:20,146
And then he ended up covering the game at PAX East,

403
00:18:20,146 --> 00:18:23,749
and at launch he wrote this really long thing,

404
00:18:23,749 --> 00:18:26,092
all because I tweeted this random thing

405
00:18:26,092 --> 00:18:26,633
and interacted with him.

406
00:18:26,633 --> 00:18:29,255
And part two is the publisher, which is Sugar's.

407
00:18:29,255 --> 00:18:29,335
So.

408
00:18:31,118 --> 00:18:33,020
At this point in the production, we

409
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,782
knew that we had something special on our hands.

410
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:38,465
And we continued to keep traveling.

411
00:18:38,465 --> 00:18:41,007
But now this time, we were trying to actively get

412
00:18:41,007 --> 00:18:42,508
a publisher on board.

413
00:18:42,508 --> 00:18:45,951
We traveled to places, Gamescom, E3, went back to studio.

414
00:18:45,951 --> 00:18:50,275
And all this time while we were making this game,

415
00:18:50,275 --> 00:18:53,097
because we were half running out of money,

416
00:18:53,097 --> 00:18:54,278
half trying to get a publisher.

417
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:57,199
The game was ready to ship like every six months.

418
00:18:57,199 --> 00:18:58,640
We were always demo ready.

419
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:04,342
That's why we could submit to many festivals and exhibitions.

420
00:19:04,342 --> 00:19:07,743
And that is how we ended up with a game starting

421
00:19:07,743 --> 00:19:08,543
to look like this.

422
00:19:08,543 --> 00:19:10,204
It's a lot prettier.

423
00:19:10,204 --> 00:19:11,824
And some of those publishers that

424
00:19:11,824 --> 00:19:14,465
said no to us in the beginning were like, hey, what's up?

425
00:19:16,202 --> 00:19:18,104
Game's looking good.

426
00:19:18,104 --> 00:19:22,347
So we started actively looking and discussing

427
00:19:22,347 --> 00:19:26,150
with several publishers about what it would mean

428
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:27,631
for them to jump on board.

429
00:19:27,631 --> 00:19:31,054
And for us, this was important because it

430
00:19:31,054 --> 00:19:34,337
was one of our pillars is we wanted to have the publisher

431
00:19:34,337 --> 00:19:35,938
so we were ready to succeed.

432
00:19:35,938 --> 00:19:38,200
But as we knew the writing on the wall,

433
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,843
we were also preparing in that unfortunate eventuality

434
00:19:41,843 --> 00:19:42,863
that we may fail.

435
00:19:43,744 --> 00:19:49,430
And that was the way we went about doing that was we got ourselves a publisher,

436
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:53,575
and because we had the publisher and the visibility, we were now at a position

437
00:19:53,575 --> 00:19:57,919
where we could talk to the government in South Africa and help us get a grant.

438
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,364
And that was going to help us, tide us through, if anything happened.

439
00:20:02,925 --> 00:20:07,149
And then we went as far as even just saying that we were going to pay ourselves a lot

440
00:20:07,149 --> 00:20:13,276
lower so that just in case things don't go well, we were in a position where we could

441
00:20:13,276 --> 00:20:17,420
still be working on things going forward.

442
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:22,606
And this was just one of the ways that we were making sure we were thinking about development

443
00:20:22,606 --> 00:20:25,208
that we were going to be able to keep going.

444
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,302
Another thing was to make sure that we carved ourselves

445
00:20:29,302 --> 00:20:32,326
a contextual path in this indie game market.

446
00:20:32,326 --> 00:20:33,847
And you get a lot of.

447
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:41,232
Knowledge from GDC and all these places, but we felt that a lot of that knowledge is from a Western perspective

448
00:20:41,232 --> 00:20:44,835
So we wanted to take it in turn and make it a way

449
00:20:44,835 --> 00:20:49,478
We looked at it from South Africa one of the biggest things that you might hear is that

450
00:20:49,478 --> 00:20:54,462
All going to shows going to things like Pax is may not be the greatest thing to do

451
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:59,286
But for us even with it being a large much

452
00:20:59,706 --> 00:21:04,627
bigger investment, we felt that was important because that gave us that access to people

453
00:21:04,627 --> 00:21:06,047
that we would have never been able to.

454
00:21:06,047 --> 00:21:11,669
And I think things like that is what happens when you become more visible and you go out

455
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:11,849
there.

456
00:21:11,849 --> 00:21:16,710
And that even helped for people to know more about South Africa and we were able to hold

457
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:21,851
something like Africa Games Week last year and then keep bringing more people to know

458
00:21:21,851 --> 00:21:27,852
about the ecosystem in South Africa so that we're also building the local industry that

459
00:21:27,852 --> 00:21:29,593
will in turn help us going forward.

460
00:21:30,994 --> 00:21:37,879
And 2018 launch year, we're excited, we've got the publisher and things are going well.

461
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:43,244
And we launched, we were getting ready to launch Semblance, but we're still always dealing

462
00:21:43,244 --> 00:21:46,466
with uniquely South African issues.

463
00:21:46,466 --> 00:21:50,610
I know for you, you know that we launched on Nintendo Switch and

464
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:55,123
For going through consoles, you need to go through certification.

465
00:21:55,123 --> 00:21:57,405
And certification will take a long time sometimes.

466
00:21:57,405 --> 00:22:00,408
But you also need to submit the game as early as possible.

467
00:22:00,408 --> 00:22:04,532
And I know we were kind of leaving it to the last minute,

468
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:08,576
but the day I was meant to be uploading the game to Nintendo,

469
00:22:08,576 --> 00:22:09,517
power disappears.

470
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,201
And then this is something that's common,

471
00:22:12,201 --> 00:22:16,285
it's even happening right now, it's called load shedding,

472
00:22:16,285 --> 00:22:19,267
where they turn off the power for a select number of hours

473
00:22:19,267 --> 00:22:21,109
until you get power again.

474
00:22:21,109 --> 00:22:23,451
So I had to explain to our publishers,

475
00:22:23,451 --> 00:22:26,153
yeah, I can't really do anything, there's just no power.

476
00:22:27,254 --> 00:22:30,915
So those are kind of those issues that we kind of deal with,

477
00:22:30,915 --> 00:22:34,516
but we eventually got it on Nintendo and got it certified.

478
00:22:34,516 --> 00:22:40,197
And so one of the big things also is while we were making the game,

479
00:22:40,197 --> 00:22:44,018
we wanted to have a different way of thinking about success.

480
00:22:44,018 --> 00:22:49,599
So we didn't want it to be purely about sales and whether you made money.

481
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:52,920
And for us, we redefined those metrics of success by

482
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,523
Can we make a name for ourselves for our debut title?

483
00:22:57,523 --> 00:23:01,206
Can we make sure that we're not just trying to make one game,

484
00:23:01,206 --> 00:23:02,387
we're trying to make lots of games?

485
00:23:02,387 --> 00:23:04,910
And that's what made some of the decisions.

486
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:08,192
Like, the most important thing was to ship a game

487
00:23:08,192 --> 00:23:10,634
so that we could get to the next one.

488
00:23:10,634 --> 00:23:15,198
And that's kind of how we were able to say that Semblance

489
00:23:15,198 --> 00:23:17,040
was a successful launch for us.

490
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:21,023
And that's how we felt that it was going to be going forward.

491
00:23:21,584 --> 00:23:25,068
And one of the next pillars is having a long-term vision.

492
00:23:25,068 --> 00:23:26,089
And we felt that.

493
00:23:27,487 --> 00:23:28,867
We're not just building one game.

494
00:23:28,867 --> 00:23:31,047
We're going to build the next game, and the next game,

495
00:23:31,047 --> 00:23:32,348
and the next game.

496
00:23:32,348 --> 00:23:35,428
So everything was about a long-term vision.

497
00:23:35,428 --> 00:23:37,949
And how we looked about making decisions today

498
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:41,890
were going to be in turn to help us tomorrow.

499
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:44,290
And those were things like making sure

500
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:46,851
that the game was well-received, and so

501
00:23:46,851 --> 00:23:49,431
that when we went back to publishers for a second time

502
00:23:49,431 --> 00:23:52,832
with a new game, we could always point back to being like, hey,

503
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,652
we managed to ship a game.

504
00:23:55,784 --> 00:24:00,288
And so that was what kept us going with a long-term vision.

505
00:24:00,288 --> 00:24:06,413
And even now, that's how we keep thinking about making

506
00:24:06,413 --> 00:24:10,197
games and how we can keep making the next game.

507
00:24:10,197 --> 00:24:11,598
So as we come to a slow end.

508
00:24:11,598 --> 00:24:11,978
As a result.

509
00:24:11,978 --> 00:24:12,619
Yeah, thank you.

510
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:15,401
As a result of this.

511
00:24:16,628 --> 00:24:20,250
In spite of those sales, we have broken in now and primed to break out.

512
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:24,532
And what we mean by that is, you know, we've made a game, we've finished, people can tell

513
00:24:24,532 --> 00:24:27,654
we're doing that, and we've set ourselves up for success in future.

514
00:24:27,654 --> 00:24:31,656
And that's a result of Semblance not making any profit yet, right?

515
00:24:31,656 --> 00:24:38,000
So while our and perhaps many other first-time creators' similar assumptions might have been

516
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,343
met with the launch of Semblance, our investment in this lateral process and goals has enabled

517
00:24:43,343 --> 00:24:45,404
us to continue making games.

518
00:24:45,797 --> 00:24:46,578
and our own studio.

519
00:24:46,578 --> 00:24:47,698
And just like details like that,

520
00:24:47,698 --> 00:24:51,321
me and Shugo have still been fully employed

521
00:24:51,321 --> 00:24:53,602
since July 2018 with like a bunch of money

522
00:24:53,602 --> 00:24:56,424
to use for prototypes and contractors.

523
00:24:56,424 --> 00:24:58,405
We're pitching a new project here at GDC,

524
00:24:58,405 --> 00:25:00,506
and it's been easier to get meetings,

525
00:25:00,506 --> 00:25:02,547
and we're also looking at other funding avenues.

526
00:25:02,547 --> 00:25:04,368
And like I said, we're primed for the future.

527
00:25:04,368 --> 00:25:05,889
We're more informed, more connected,

528
00:25:05,889 --> 00:25:07,370
and more reputable as well.

529
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:10,652
And someone let us do a solo GDC talk.

530
00:25:12,209 --> 00:25:16,272
This process is still ongoing though, so ask us in six months if it all worked.

531
00:25:16,272 --> 00:25:18,954
Hopefully it will.

532
00:25:18,954 --> 00:25:25,639
And so just to summarize those processes is, you know, be ready to succeed but also prepared

533
00:25:25,639 --> 00:25:27,840
to fail in case, sadly, it might happen.

534
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,262
Redefine your metrics of success.

535
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:33,124
Don't necessarily just think it's always about, like, sales.

536
00:25:33,124 --> 00:25:35,185
Have that long-term vision.

537
00:25:35,185 --> 00:25:38,267
Best creative integrity is being able to make another game.

538
00:25:38,664 --> 00:25:44,148
Be visible, be reputable so that you can have something to point to and people know of you for the future.

539
00:25:44,148 --> 00:25:47,830
Learn a lot and make decisions so you can apply that learning quickly.

540
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:54,614
You can't apply things you learnt on the first game if your first game takes 5 to 10 years.

541
00:25:54,614 --> 00:25:56,415
And also just carve that contextual path.

542
00:25:56,415 --> 00:25:59,897
And part of that is just remembering all advice is bad, including this.

543
00:25:59,897 --> 00:26:03,339
And the reason it's bad is because it's not...

544
00:26:03,753 --> 00:26:04,634
It's not contextual.

545
00:26:04,634 --> 00:26:06,196
It doesn't apply to your context, right?

546
00:26:06,196 --> 00:26:09,179
And because of that, you need to go out and get as much

547
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:12,322
advice as possible so that you can decide

548
00:26:12,322 --> 00:26:13,883
which advice is good.

549
00:26:13,883 --> 00:26:16,506
You can fail with it, experiment, and see what

550
00:26:16,506 --> 00:26:18,067
really works for you.

551
00:26:18,067 --> 00:26:20,610
And so thank you for listening to us talk.

552
00:26:27,547 --> 00:26:29,888
So we've got like five minutes for questions.

553
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:32,070
Are you fine with questions?

554
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:32,590
Yeah, I think I'm good.

555
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:32,810
OK, cool.

556
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:34,131
Does anyone have any questions?

557
00:26:34,131 --> 00:26:35,751
I think there's a mic somewhere.

558
00:26:35,751 --> 00:26:36,352
Oh, thank god.

559
00:26:36,352 --> 00:26:39,253
It's always awkward when you're like, does anyone have any questions?

560
00:26:39,253 --> 00:26:41,674
And you wait like two minutes and then no one asks anything.

561
00:26:41,674 --> 00:26:45,817
So I'm curious from when you guys decided to move into a commercial build,

562
00:26:45,817 --> 00:26:49,038
how much longer it took than what you initially estimated?

563
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:54,257
And then how much of that was just inherent to the development process that you hadn't

564
00:26:54,257 --> 00:26:57,742
learned about and how much of it was things you wish you could have done differently if

565
00:26:57,742 --> 00:26:58,163
you did it again.

566
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:03,122
Well, I think, in fact, when we started the project,

567
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:04,503
we were like, yeah, we're going to just do,

568
00:27:04,503 --> 00:27:06,764
it was always going to be our starter project,

569
00:27:06,764 --> 00:27:08,845
like, oh, we'll do six to eight months,

570
00:27:08,845 --> 00:27:09,626
you know, and get it on itch,

571
00:27:09,626 --> 00:27:12,027
and then we'll get to the real game.

572
00:27:12,027 --> 00:27:16,469
So when we started, we had a bit of ups and downs.

573
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:18,590
And so some of it was based on things

574
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:20,711
like we just didn't know about making video games,

575
00:27:20,711 --> 00:27:22,132
like things take extra long.

576
00:27:22,452 --> 00:27:24,253
But another thing that made it longer

577
00:27:24,253 --> 00:27:29,194
was because we were doing things like trying to get a publisher,

578
00:27:29,194 --> 00:27:30,295
going to events.

579
00:27:30,295 --> 00:27:32,035
Sometimes no one would be working

580
00:27:32,035 --> 00:27:33,916
on the game for two weeks.

581
00:27:33,916 --> 00:27:38,157
And so development wasn't as straight cut as possible.

582
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:42,559
We still think the game was built technically in 18 months.

583
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,099
But even though the lifespan was three years,

584
00:27:45,099 --> 00:27:47,820
because there were years with barely any work on them.

585
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,581
I don't know if that answers the question.

586
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:52,417
Hi.

587
00:27:52,417 --> 00:27:57,221
Could you guys maybe paint me a quick picture of what the

588
00:27:57,221 --> 00:28:00,263
game development scene is like in South Africa?

589
00:28:00,263 --> 00:28:02,305
Because I have no idea.

590
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:03,866
It's super curious to me.

591
00:28:03,866 --> 00:28:05,828
I think the total number of workers is around

592
00:28:05,828 --> 00:28:06,889
700 at the moment.

593
00:28:06,889 --> 00:28:09,911
So it's a very small scene, but we've had some very big

594
00:28:09,911 --> 00:28:11,072
successes.

595
00:28:11,072 --> 00:28:14,275
The most American game ever made, Broforce, is from South

596
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:18,018
Africa, also a penis sports game.

597
00:28:18,832 --> 00:28:21,893
which was nominated for a narrative award this year at the IGF,

598
00:28:21,893 --> 00:28:25,715
Jennifer Jousling. I didn't make the rules.

599
00:28:25,715 --> 00:28:28,517
Stuff like Viscera Cleanup Detail,

600
00:28:28,517 --> 00:28:32,659
which is a game about cleaning up after sci-fi massacres.

601
00:28:32,659 --> 00:28:40,563
So we have a bunch of successful games for a very tiny community.

602
00:28:41,048 --> 00:28:46,032
You might know of Amaze Berlin, which is this big independent

603
00:28:46,032 --> 00:28:47,033
games festival in Berlin.

604
00:28:47,033 --> 00:28:49,654
And for the last five, six years, we've had a Johannesburg

605
00:28:49,654 --> 00:28:53,397
version, which has helped us connect to the international

606
00:28:53,397 --> 00:28:54,077
community quite a lot.

607
00:28:54,077 --> 00:28:57,580
So it's quite small, but for the impact it has, it's quite

608
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:57,860
cool.

609
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:00,282
I can send you blogs and articles.

610
00:29:00,282 --> 00:29:02,643
It's a lot.

611
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:03,635
Are you leaving?

612
00:29:03,635 --> 00:29:03,735
Hi.

613
00:29:03,735 --> 00:29:08,760
So one thing you guys mentioned is that when you first

614
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,482
launched, you were kind of going up against a lot of

615
00:29:11,482 --> 00:29:14,185
AAA games, a lot of really big games.

616
00:29:14,185 --> 00:29:18,089
So I guess my question is, what can we do as consumers to

617
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,892
kind of support developers like you guys more?

618
00:29:22,355 --> 00:29:24,796
It shows lots of things, but yeah.

619
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:26,096
Yeah, I don't know, man.

620
00:29:26,096 --> 00:29:26,396
It's hard.

621
00:29:26,396 --> 00:29:28,497
I mean, you kind of saw all the metrics we had.

622
00:29:28,497 --> 00:29:31,038
We had a million social media impressions at launch.

623
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:33,418
We had a lot of metrics which, on paper,

624
00:29:33,418 --> 00:29:37,619
showed that the game could sell and would sell.

625
00:29:37,619 --> 00:29:38,139
So I don't know.

626
00:29:38,139 --> 00:29:39,240
As a consumer, I don't know.

627
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,640
Stop playing Fortnite.

628
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,161
You and all the streamers.

629
00:29:43,161 --> 00:29:46,001
It's just like, they only play Fortnite.

630
00:29:46,001 --> 00:29:46,541
So yeah, I don't know.

631
00:29:46,541 --> 00:29:48,142
It's just the whole ecosystem.

632
00:29:48,142 --> 00:29:49,342
It's systemic, I think.

633
00:29:49,862 --> 00:29:54,310
I wish I knew so I could tell you to do it and force you and follow up every six months

634
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,953
to make sure you're doing it.

635
00:29:55,953 --> 00:29:56,213
But I don't.

636
00:29:56,213 --> 00:29:57,756
Yeah.

637
00:29:57,756 --> 00:29:58,057
Sorry.

638
00:29:58,057 --> 00:29:58,538
No problem.

639
00:29:58,538 --> 00:29:58,878
Thanks.

640
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:05,934
Hey fellas, great work. Question, how much money has been spent up to this point?

641
00:30:05,934 --> 00:30:07,695
Is there a crazy number?

642
00:30:07,695 --> 00:30:08,856
On the game?

643
00:30:08,856 --> 00:30:11,638
Yeah, it's been a few years now.

644
00:30:11,638 --> 00:30:15,601
I think we might be on the NDA with our publisher deals.

645
00:30:15,601 --> 00:30:15,941
Oh really?

646
00:30:15,941 --> 00:30:17,342
Exact amount, yeah.

647
00:30:17,342 --> 00:30:19,123
Is that curated?

648
00:30:19,123 --> 00:30:20,685
It's like a few hundred thousand.

649
00:30:20,685 --> 00:30:21,745
A few hundred thousand?

650
00:30:21,745 --> 00:30:22,045
Yeah.

651
00:30:22,045 --> 00:30:24,887
But it's really hard to tell as well because of...

652
00:30:25,738 --> 00:30:28,279
The way it was developed, like Sugar said,

653
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:30,841
like it's 18 months was the real realistic full time

654
00:30:30,841 --> 00:30:33,322
development, and that happened over like three years.

655
00:30:33,322 --> 00:30:36,624
So it's also like real amount, like if we paid ourselves

656
00:30:36,624 --> 00:30:37,905
fully, how much would it have cost?

657
00:30:37,905 --> 00:30:39,246
It's really hard.

658
00:30:39,246 --> 00:30:42,148
Yeah, like the first year we were both living

659
00:30:42,148 --> 00:30:42,968
with our parents.

660
00:30:42,968 --> 00:30:45,870
So there was no cost then technically,

661
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:50,773
but there was like time that you spent in it.

662
00:30:50,773 --> 00:30:53,274
So if you were to calculate that, yeah,

663
00:30:53,274 --> 00:30:54,295
it's definitely hundreds.

664
00:30:55,643 --> 00:30:57,826
Cool, no more questions.

665
00:30:57,826 --> 00:30:58,526
Cool, all right.

666
00:30:58,526 --> 00:31:00,508
Thanks for coming.
