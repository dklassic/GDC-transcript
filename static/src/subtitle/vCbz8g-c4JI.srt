00:00:01,647 --> 00:00:07,670
Good morning everybody. Welcome to this panel which has very few of the original members on it.

2
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:13,273
I was asked to walk in and help out with this and I've been having a terrific time.

3
00:00:13,693 --> 00:00:18,475
So we're going to talk about the care and feeding of wild fan sites here at GDC. I hope you're all prepared for this.

4
00:00:20,105 --> 00:00:21,306
All right, so introductions.

5
00:00:22,047 --> 00:00:23,088
My name is Linda Carlson.

6
00:00:23,168 --> 00:00:24,469
I'll be moderating this panel,

7
00:00:24,749 --> 00:00:26,730
and currently I'm the Director of Community Relations

8
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:27,591
at Trion Worlds.

9
00:00:27,911 --> 00:00:29,332
Before that, I worked for many years

10
00:00:29,412 --> 00:00:30,713
at Sony Online Entertainment,

11
00:00:31,013 --> 00:00:33,455
and before that, I was a fan site operator.

12
00:00:34,796 --> 00:00:36,838
And you guys can introduce yourselves

13
00:00:36,898 --> 00:00:37,898
and tell us a little bit about

14
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:39,640
how you have been involved in fan sites.

15
00:00:40,535 --> 00:00:44,318
Hi, I'm Kristen Oberton. I am currently a senior lecturer at DigiPen.

16
00:00:44,619 --> 00:00:48,142
I also work outside the game industry right now, but my history is

17
00:00:48,162 --> 00:00:51,766
I got into games through fan sites far too long ago,

18
00:00:52,566 --> 00:00:56,350
then became a producer in the industry, so now I spent a lot of time

19
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:59,933
figuring out how to balance the value of building

20
00:01:00,354 --> 00:01:04,958
as well as communicating with community. So it's been a fun journey to be on both sides of that.

21
00:01:06,886 --> 00:01:11,067
And my name is Star Long. I've been making games for about 25 years.

22
00:01:12,308 --> 00:01:14,689
My first game was a game called Ultima Online,

23
00:01:15,549 --> 00:01:21,791
and which spun up some of the very first community fan sites like Stratix and other sites like that.

24
00:01:22,712 --> 00:01:30,094
So, been sort of involved with this from the ground up of working with fan sites, trying to get them what they need,

25
00:01:31,275 --> 00:01:32,775
being very open with them, etc.

26
00:01:32,915 --> 00:01:36,477
And now I'm with a company called Portalarium working on a product called Shroud of the Avatar.

27
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,011
Hi, I'm Jennifer Page. I'm the... what is my title?

28
00:01:41,431 --> 00:01:42,712
What is your title?

29
00:01:43,072 --> 00:01:47,033
Today, I'm the Community Strategist Lead for Microsoft Studios Xbox.

30
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:53,035
I got started in community and gaming writing for Stratix for Ultima Online.

31
00:01:53,435 --> 00:01:53,555
Aha!

32
00:01:54,095 --> 00:01:56,136
Everything always goes back to UO, I have a theory.

33
00:01:56,256 --> 00:01:57,617
Yeah, hey, me too.

34
00:01:57,977 --> 00:01:59,317
Oh, hey! Reunion.

35
00:02:01,172 --> 00:02:02,713
This happened on more panels than I could tell you.

36
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:08,755
So not only did I write, and then I also did Sonoma Quest News, which was my own fan site

37
00:02:08,775 --> 00:02:09,215
for a while.

38
00:02:10,955 --> 00:02:13,836
And I kept having opinions and running fan sites.

39
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:14,756
As you do, yes.

40
00:02:15,076 --> 00:02:16,137
I'm a very subtle woman.

41
00:02:17,577 --> 00:02:21,078
And after a while, a company finally hired me, because I think they wanted me to shut

42
00:02:21,138 --> 00:02:21,218
up.

43
00:02:21,338 --> 00:02:22,178
I don't know that it worked.

44
00:02:23,449 --> 00:02:30,813
So, really grew up from the very basement of the beginning of online gaming and fansites themselves.

45
00:02:31,393 --> 00:02:34,094
Right, so now we're going to talk about fansites and what defines them.

46
00:02:34,455 --> 00:02:40,638
Of course, most of us, when we first started working on this, most fansites were websites, blogs, that sort of thing.

47
00:02:40,718 --> 00:02:42,319
And they still exist, there's lots of them.

48
00:02:42,679 --> 00:02:45,520
But there are so many different types of fansites now.

49
00:02:46,161 --> 00:02:47,401
YouTube, Twitch, Twitter.

50
00:02:47,742 --> 00:02:54,323
Twitter seems like an odd one, but I have a couple of fan sites who operate only in Twitter.

51
00:02:54,443 --> 00:02:58,344
They're very visually oriented, they do a lot of memes and screenshots, that sort of

52
00:02:58,364 --> 00:02:58,524
thing.

53
00:02:58,924 --> 00:03:00,645
Facebook has groups and fan sites.

54
00:03:01,105 --> 00:03:05,486
Wikis are a highly overlooked type of fan site because they're run by players.

55
00:03:05,926 --> 00:03:10,687
Reddit, Discord, Guild Portals, and God only knows what we're going to be doing next year,

56
00:03:10,707 --> 00:03:11,788
it'll be the next cool thing.

57
00:03:12,248 --> 00:03:17,589
So the question for the panel here is, how has the gaming industry's approach to fan sites changed over the years?

58
00:03:17,629 --> 00:03:21,610
I can remember times when it was somewhat adversarial. Who'd like to start with that?

59
00:03:23,251 --> 00:03:28,152
How has it changed? So it's interesting because I think initially, I'm going back to UO again,

60
00:03:29,512 --> 00:03:34,574
initially there were these fan sites that kind of tried to find leaks and tried to get inside scoops,

61
00:03:34,934 --> 00:03:36,094
but also reported on...

62
00:03:37,296 --> 00:03:44,038
Everything that was happening within the game itself, mainly quest and live fiction stuff,

63
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:46,559
as well as patch notes and all that, but that created community.

64
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:52,881
And it was a little, let's see what we can leak, let's see what we can get, but it changed

65
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:56,922
pretty quickly to being things like Stratix, where you could read and find out what was

66
00:03:56,942 --> 00:03:59,743
happening in the game while you were sitting at work, and then it was more of a, let us

67
00:03:59,803 --> 00:04:03,565
be your, you know, microphone for the content that the game is actually creating.

68
00:04:05,186 --> 00:04:10,131
From there it's evolved into everything from QA testers from fan sites because they give

69
00:04:10,252 --> 00:04:16,779
great insight on games themselves to being a core part of the team even in early development

70
00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:18,861
which was not the case when it first started.

71
00:04:20,243 --> 00:04:26,127
So when I was also at Stratix, by the way, and I started the first Neverwinter Nights

72
00:04:26,948 --> 00:04:32,272
site for Stratix, and it was probably one of the first true partnerships with Bioware

73
00:04:32,292 --> 00:04:33,413
when they came out with that game.

74
00:04:34,193 --> 00:04:38,276
And we actually built tools because there were not a lot of data sources for information

75
00:04:38,296 --> 00:04:39,357
about what was going on in the game.

76
00:04:40,038 --> 00:04:43,020
So we were actually, had one of the first tools.

77
00:04:44,111 --> 00:04:45,512
on one of the fan sites.

78
00:04:45,572 --> 00:04:47,935
We didn't really think of ourselves as a fan site those days.

79
00:04:47,975 --> 00:04:49,457
We didn't think of ourselves as a community site.

80
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,840
We were information about the game site.

81
00:04:52,361 --> 00:04:58,689
We didn't really have the nicely framed community site or community fan sites we have now.

82
00:04:59,795 --> 00:05:03,337
And it was really cool because we started off on our own,

83
00:05:03,377 --> 00:05:04,398
and then all of a sudden, Bioware

84
00:05:04,418 --> 00:05:05,278
found out what we were doing.

85
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,539
And they were like, you guys are doing some great stuff.

86
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,340
How can we help?

87
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,561
And it was one of the first partnerships.

88
00:05:10,621 --> 00:05:12,963
And I absolutely loved working with them.

89
00:05:13,183 --> 00:05:15,384
And years later, to actually work alongside them

90
00:05:15,444 --> 00:05:17,966
on some projects and meet them in person.

91
00:05:18,326 --> 00:05:19,167
So it was very cool.

92
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:21,168
It is when it all comes full circle.

93
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:22,769
Yeah, it does.

94
00:05:23,709 --> 00:05:24,270
It's interesting.

95
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:26,151
It really pivoted quickly, I think,

96
00:05:26,251 --> 00:05:28,872
to being a very, very cooperative relationship.

97
00:05:28,952 --> 00:05:29,213
I mean, I.

98
00:05:30,552 --> 00:05:34,554
Yeah, there are certainly sites that are more about the cheats and the exploits, but I mean,

99
00:05:34,574 --> 00:05:39,057
they literally advertise themselves as that's what we do, like we're about hacks and cheats

100
00:05:39,097 --> 00:05:39,517
and exploits.

101
00:05:39,537 --> 00:05:44,580
But for the most part, it really is a cooperative exercise between the two.

102
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:51,003
But like you said, you know, it has evolved now where for us, I mean, most of our effort

103
00:05:51,423 --> 00:05:55,506
now is directed at wikis and Twitch channels.

104
00:05:55,546 --> 00:05:59,248
Those are the two, I would say, the two biggest areas of focus for us.

105
00:05:59,842 --> 00:06:05,164
And to the point where, you know, another interesting evolution I've seen is that,

106
00:06:05,705 --> 00:06:12,907
you know, a lot of the sites have been scraping data sort of on their own for the long term.

107
00:06:13,268 --> 00:06:16,709
But one of the things that, you know, I see a lot of us doing now is...

108
00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:24,051
intentionally exposing data and giving tools to the sites and the fan, especially the wikis,

109
00:06:24,471 --> 00:06:29,132
and saying, oh, well, I see you're scraping all this data to get, like, all the crafting recipes

110
00:06:29,212 --> 00:06:35,953
or get all the stats for the weapons. And most of that's right, but because of the way you're

111
00:06:35,973 --> 00:06:40,674
doing it, some of it's coming out incorrect and whatever. So, you know, a lot of us are now

112
00:06:41,254 --> 00:06:42,735
actually exposing that data.

113
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:48,438
directly to them and giving them tools so that they can expose that and present that on a site.

114
00:06:48,718 --> 00:06:54,182
And often, you know, it's, it's, the community is better served in that way because a lot of times,

115
00:06:54,262 --> 00:06:57,204
especially for like, for us, like we're a small project, we have a small team,

116
00:06:57,544 --> 00:07:01,747
we don't have the bandwidth to put a website up that shows literally every single weapon,

117
00:07:01,807 --> 00:07:03,368
and every single stat, and every single...

118
00:07:03,828 --> 00:07:06,529
combination of like when I craft with this material, etc.

119
00:07:06,869 --> 00:07:10,550
But the players, when we give them the tools to expose that data,

120
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:13,690
and they can assemble a wiki that shows every single crafting combination,

121
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,831
of which there are millions.

122
00:07:16,611 --> 00:07:19,892
So it's really interesting to see that evolution of them manually

123
00:07:20,272 --> 00:07:22,833
scraping that after the fact and us giving them tools to do that.

124
00:07:23,013 --> 00:07:25,113
Absolutely. I think it took a lot of acceptance and

125
00:07:26,354 --> 00:07:29,914
letting go of the fear of what fansites are going to do with this information

126
00:07:29,954 --> 00:07:30,695
and realizing

127
00:07:31,095 --> 00:07:35,359
That they're really doing free work that benefits everybody in the community and the company.

128
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,063
Jen, what is your company's approach to emerging media?

129
00:07:39,103 --> 00:07:41,646
Like, how do you assess the new style of fan site?

130
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:46,411
Like, have you gone all... did you go all in on Instagram or Snapchat or anything like that when they came out?

131
00:07:46,731 --> 00:07:47,251
We deny it.

132
00:07:48,152 --> 00:07:50,114
No, I'm just kidding, we don't deny it.

133
00:07:50,755 --> 00:07:52,096
We just act like the world doesn't change.

134
00:07:52,537 --> 00:07:54,339
No, experiment, right?

135
00:07:55,410 --> 00:08:03,804
You want to stay real solid in the areas that you know that will produce for you, the audiences will produce for you, whether it's streaming or, you know, wikis and all that.

136
00:08:04,325 --> 00:08:09,193
And then in addition to that, we do put our toe in every water to see how is this.

137
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:14,112
You're doing a lot of research, engaging with the fans on those sites by showing up and

138
00:08:14,152 --> 00:08:15,353
saying hey I like the work you're doing.

139
00:08:15,773 --> 00:08:17,374
And seeing kind of what they're doing.

140
00:08:17,534 --> 00:08:18,754
Giving them a little information.

141
00:08:19,454 --> 00:08:20,975
Building relationships with those people.

142
00:08:22,996 --> 00:08:27,298
Gone is the day where as community managers people didn't know your real name and they

143
00:08:27,318 --> 00:08:27,898
couldn't find you.

144
00:08:28,078 --> 00:08:28,438
You know?

145
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,219
You used to be like Batman, right?

146
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,040
Now they can find you.

147
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,161
They can email you.

148
00:08:33,181 --> 00:08:34,141
They can ping you on Twitter.

149
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:34,901
So you might as well have a...

150
00:08:34,921 --> 00:08:35,001
Yeah.

151
00:08:35,021 --> 00:08:35,141
I mean...

152
00:08:35,161 --> 00:08:35,282
I mean...

153
00:08:35,302 --> 00:08:35,422
I mean...

154
00:08:35,853 --> 00:08:41,718
Cooperative engagement with your fansites and your fans who are on the leading edge

155
00:08:41,738 --> 00:08:42,298
of all that stuff.

156
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,361
Because I will never be as good as my game's fans.

157
00:08:45,701 --> 00:08:49,565
And I will never be as knowledgeable because they live it.

158
00:08:50,325 --> 00:08:52,047
I work it, which is a totally different perspective.

159
00:08:52,507 --> 00:08:56,010
It is really interesting when they can actually embarrass you by your lack of knowledge in

160
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:58,473
the product that they know so well, but you're working on a game.

161
00:08:58,493 --> 00:09:00,735
It helps to go out there saying, I know you guys know more than me.

162
00:09:00,995 --> 00:09:02,516
So it's just out the door.

163
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:07,813
Alright, so we want to talk a little bit about why do we seek them, what are the benefits to it.

164
00:09:08,413 --> 00:09:14,837
Clearly they are community leaders, they can be influencers, they can also be allies in talking to your players,

165
00:09:15,118 --> 00:09:19,280
and they provide free media and content which benefits the players and the company.

166
00:09:19,621 --> 00:09:24,064
So the question for the panel is, how have fansites affected your company and community,

167
00:09:24,604 --> 00:09:31,248
and even more importantly these days of careful budgeting, can ROI be effectively tracked for fansite impact?

168
00:09:32,858 --> 00:09:33,619
Oh, that's a tough one.

169
00:09:33,859 --> 00:09:34,119
I know.

170
00:09:34,439 --> 00:09:35,219
You can start then.

171
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:37,940
And that's one of the things as a producer,

172
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,101
OK, what's the return on the investment?

173
00:09:40,201 --> 00:09:42,841
Because a lot of times working with community,

174
00:09:43,922 --> 00:09:46,963
there's a lot of demands for what we could do,

175
00:09:47,763 --> 00:09:49,763
but you've got to figure out what you should do.

176
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:54,895
Every time they make a request for an interview with one of your teams,

177
00:09:54,935 --> 00:09:59,381
especially if it's during the day, that's taking away working on and building that game that they're waiting for,

178
00:09:59,562 --> 00:10:01,144
or that next new update.

179
00:10:02,526 --> 00:10:05,770
Every time you're working on some new art for some fan site,

180
00:10:06,286 --> 00:10:08,747
You know, contest or event, same thing.

181
00:10:08,867 --> 00:10:10,167
You're taking it away from your game.

182
00:10:10,187 --> 00:10:12,188
So you have to pay attention to those tradeoffs.

183
00:10:13,768 --> 00:10:16,709
As much as you want to, sometimes you have to say no.

184
00:10:17,569 --> 00:10:19,770
Because you know the return on the investment is not going to

185
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,550
be the best thing for your game.

186
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:26,912
And it's one of those mixed blessings, I think, because

187
00:10:26,932 --> 00:10:28,192
you think about.

188
00:10:29,181 --> 00:10:33,723
Oh, at least for me, having been on the other side of that line, right, making those requests.

189
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:37,785
I was the one who was, you know, writing to BioWare saying, hey, can we get some cool

190
00:10:37,885 --> 00:10:39,165
art for this next site?

191
00:10:39,185 --> 00:10:42,387
Because we're trying to build our community and that was one of the draws we used to use

192
00:10:42,427 --> 00:10:47,109
back then was art signed by the artist because you didn't have as many of the early access

193
00:10:47,129 --> 00:10:47,769
things you do now.

194
00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:52,351
And so on the other side of it, when I'm working on the game, I'm sitting there going, God,

195
00:10:52,371 --> 00:10:54,792
I really want to help you because I remember being in your position.

196
00:10:55,452 --> 00:10:56,693
But now I have a different role.

197
00:10:57,653 --> 00:10:58,633
So balancing that is hard.

198
00:10:58,973 --> 00:11:01,654
Anyone else have any ideas of how ROI can be tracked?

199
00:11:01,714 --> 00:11:04,716
Can you use analytics to see what kind of hits the sites get?

200
00:11:04,936 --> 00:11:06,817
So when deciding who you want to work with,

201
00:11:07,177 --> 00:11:09,178
I think you have to, that's part of the game, right?

202
00:11:09,198 --> 00:11:11,519
I mean, part of it is you don't ignore the smaller,

203
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,361
up and coming, passionate, intelligent fan sites.

204
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:16,502
You want to feed those, that garden.

205
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,963
But you also have to identify who do you invest in?

206
00:11:19,483 --> 00:11:21,384
Who has messaging that's, you know,

207
00:11:21,464 --> 00:11:22,745
in line with where you're trying to go

208
00:11:22,825 --> 00:11:24,326
and who has a really solid following?

209
00:11:25,246 --> 00:11:30,069
Looking at stuff like impressions, if you're talking about social, how many impressions do these people get?

210
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,390
Does this fan site get?

211
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:33,972
Looking at the kind of traffic they're getting to their site.

212
00:11:34,753 --> 00:11:36,734
And the kind of engagement, and that's huge for me.

213
00:11:36,814 --> 00:11:39,776
And this is where I've yet to find a tool that does it really well.

214
00:11:39,816 --> 00:11:41,257
It's better just go through and read.

215
00:11:41,818 --> 00:11:43,859
What is the sentiment of the site?

216
00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:45,120
What kind of feedback are they getting?

217
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,062
For us, one of the biggest things we get...

218
00:11:47,714 --> 00:11:49,315
is the conversation in there.

219
00:11:49,615 --> 00:11:51,016
They will tell us, by the way, we're

220
00:11:51,036 --> 00:11:52,857
hearing a lot of this on our site.

221
00:11:53,217 --> 00:11:54,558
There's a lot of concern around this.

222
00:11:55,419 --> 00:11:56,199
And they'll let us know that.

223
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:58,680
And since we're not in there every day,

224
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:02,303
it's extremely helpful if it's actionable feedback.

225
00:12:02,523 --> 00:12:05,264
And training your community fan sites how to do that

226
00:12:05,364 --> 00:12:05,985
is a big part of it.

227
00:12:06,571 --> 00:12:09,452
I think the other part is also, do they fill a unique niche?

228
00:12:10,512 --> 00:12:14,253
When you look across your whole bandwidth of fan sites and community sites, are they

229
00:12:14,293 --> 00:12:15,553
doing something nobody else is doing?

230
00:12:16,114 --> 00:12:18,634
Are they covering a part of your game in a way that nobody else is?

231
00:12:19,355 --> 00:12:23,116
So look for those ones that kind of fill in the holes in their puzzle, because that's

232
00:12:23,136 --> 00:12:27,677
where the extra value is and the full coverage of your title and your game will come in.

233
00:12:27,857 --> 00:12:32,598
Star, do you have any feedback on the way that some fan sites, maybe even specific ones,

234
00:12:32,638 --> 00:12:35,179
have affected your company and your gaming community?

235
00:12:35,748 --> 00:12:42,329
Yeah, I mean I would riff on the look at the opportunities, specifically for things that

236
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:47,591
either you're not able to deliver on your own, you know, like if it's exposing bits

237
00:12:47,651 --> 00:12:51,832
of data that you can't, you know, you don't have the bandwidth to show, if it's highlighting

238
00:12:51,872 --> 00:12:56,393
things that the community is doing, so if you have a product where the community does

239
00:12:56,473 --> 00:12:57,993
lots of things in the game, whether it's

240
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:05,358
Streaming matches or whether they set up events inside the game, if the players are highlighting that.

241
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:17,033
If you know, look for the things that you're not, you just don't have the bandwidth to cover. And if they're doing a good job of that, you know, highlighting them recognizing them. That's where you spend your bandwidth to support them.

242
00:13:17,911 --> 00:13:24,414
So, I think it's less about tracking the actual monetary value and more about where they are

243
00:13:24,574 --> 00:13:29,497
fulfilling a need for the community and a gap that you may not be able to fill yourself.

244
00:13:30,558 --> 00:13:34,480
And then also, you know, there are, but there are metrics, like you were saying, you know,

245
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:39,162
I mean like Twitch, Twitch is a super easy one, you know, like look how many followers

246
00:13:39,202 --> 00:13:43,265
they have, like look, you know, go watch one of their streams and go see how many views

247
00:13:43,285 --> 00:13:44,706
they're getting during the stream.

248
00:13:45,606 --> 00:13:51,910
You know, like if it's somebody that is on Twitter, look how many followers they have.

249
00:13:52,671 --> 00:13:57,213
All those things are easy metrics for you to gauge about how much bandwidth you should spend.

250
00:13:57,634 --> 00:14:04,258
And then to your point about going and looking at the conversations that are happening,

251
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,500
it's really important to look at the tone.

252
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:13,524
You know, so the tone of a community site is critically important for...

253
00:14:14,582 --> 00:14:15,763
your product.

254
00:14:16,444 --> 00:14:20,668
That's not to say you only want to embrace the fan sites that are

255
00:14:20,728 --> 00:14:21,970
quote, drinking the Kool-Aid.

256
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:23,391
That are the white knights.

257
00:14:23,491 --> 00:14:25,954
Right. Because then you're going to get the reputation, well, you only

258
00:14:25,994 --> 00:14:28,757
support the guys that are 100 percent on your side.

259
00:14:29,137 --> 00:14:32,941
So it's okay to support sites that are giving you critical feedback.

260
00:14:33,321 --> 00:14:34,022
But you.

261
00:14:34,783 --> 00:14:40,126
You also don't want to go support a site that is all just trolly, negative,

262
00:14:40,767 --> 00:14:43,628
because that contributes nothing to your community, right?

263
00:14:44,029 --> 00:14:46,530
And so that's where you want to be careful about,

264
00:14:47,131 --> 00:14:49,973
or that they're doing even worse,

265
00:14:50,053 --> 00:14:53,935
like they're doing racist or misogynist things, or whatever.

266
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:01,764
You know, like, so you have to be, that's also where you have to be super careful, you know, about what sites are supporting.

267
00:15:01,784 --> 00:15:09,068
You have to look at what kind of community are they attracting, you know, because especially now in this climate,

268
00:15:09,668 --> 00:15:14,131
that's something to be super careful of because if they are attracting the wrong kind of community,

269
00:15:14,511 --> 00:15:20,075
that can be, that can have sort of wide-reaching damaging effects to your larger community.

270
00:15:20,447 --> 00:15:25,191
Right. We're now going to move on to reaching out. Of course, the gold standard, what we

271
00:15:25,231 --> 00:15:30,336
all started with, is the easiest, the passive fan site kit. And there is no excuse for any

272
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:35,120
company not to have one of these. Make it easy to find, have it on your website, and

273
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:40,746
that'll contain things, the simple things, logos, artwork, screenshots, video, audio

274
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:44,629
clips. A lot of fan sites like to use bits of audio in their...

275
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:48,932
So, I'm going to ask you to tell us about your own ideal approach to fan site outreach.

276
00:15:48,972 --> 00:15:50,092
How do you contact them?

277
00:15:50,112 --> 00:15:55,775
So, I'm going to ask you to tell us about your own ideal approach to fan site outreach.

278
00:15:55,795 --> 00:15:57,276
How do you contact them?

279
00:15:57,296 --> 00:16:02,119
So, I'm going to ask you to tell us about your own ideal approach to fan site outreach.

280
00:16:02,179 --> 00:16:03,459
How do you contact them?

281
00:16:07,724 --> 00:16:12,006
So for us, they often contact us before we have a chance to even contact them, right?

282
00:16:12,026 --> 00:16:14,768
Because again, we're accessible. You can find us. You can reach out.

283
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:18,710
And actually right now we're working with a fan site called Phantom Dusted

284
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:22,872
because we're bringing back Phantom Dust in terms of compatibility and all that.

285
00:16:22,912 --> 00:16:24,453
Look it up. It's an awesome game.

286
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:29,756
But we knew, this was one of those niche games that had a hardcore following

287
00:16:30,116 --> 00:16:31,597
that was just rabid.

288
00:16:31,817 --> 00:16:34,838
That this game is not new. It's been out for a long time.

289
00:16:35,139 --> 00:16:38,000
And yet this community exists and is just passionate.

290
00:16:38,701 --> 00:16:41,963
And we knew we would never do this game justice like they do.

291
00:16:42,223 --> 00:16:43,304
I mean, they have the wikis.

292
00:16:43,344 --> 00:16:44,524
They have the deck builders.

293
00:16:45,525 --> 00:16:46,826
There's no way we could touch it.

294
00:16:46,946 --> 00:16:49,808
So while they've been in contact with us, just as soon

295
00:16:49,828 --> 00:16:51,909
as they heard the announcement, they started reaching out to

296
00:16:51,989 --> 00:16:55,051
us, we actually now have weekly calls with them about

297
00:16:55,111 --> 00:16:56,272
how can we support you?

298
00:16:56,452 --> 00:16:59,314
How can we get your content in front of our audience?

299
00:17:00,475 --> 00:17:03,376
So we do weekly calls with that particular fan site.

300
00:17:03,497 --> 00:17:04,457
Other fan sites might be.

301
00:17:05,251 --> 00:17:06,973
A forum, newsletters, things like that.

302
00:17:07,553 --> 00:17:12,899
But it's a relationship and it's a trusting relationship on both sides and that's important

303
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:14,620
to honor if you want it to be effective.

304
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:19,966
Do you assign, do any of you assign a person to work specifically with fan sites within

305
00:17:19,986 --> 00:17:22,048
your company, to be the liaison for it?

306
00:17:22,228 --> 00:17:25,872
For us it's the community manager, whoever's the community manager on that product.

307
00:17:26,696 --> 00:17:27,257
Okay.

308
00:17:27,377 --> 00:17:32,561
Yeah, we, it's usually the community manager, but sometimes, like for us, again, we're a

309
00:17:32,581 --> 00:17:37,165
small team, and so it's the community manager, but sometimes it's also myself.

310
00:17:37,546 --> 00:17:37,686
Right.

311
00:17:37,706 --> 00:17:45,713
And so, especially if it's a large site, or in our case, like another example would be

312
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:47,214
for us the syndicate.

313
00:17:48,246 --> 00:17:52,768
So they're the longest running, largest guild ever.

314
00:17:52,888 --> 00:17:55,030
So they started in Ultima Online,

315
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,711
and then they moved to World of Warcraft,

316
00:17:56,751 --> 00:17:58,872
and they've been basically in every MMO since.

317
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:01,213
And they're like 800 members,

318
00:18:01,493 --> 00:18:02,794
and they've been continuously running.

319
00:18:03,295 --> 00:18:07,117
And so I go to their annual convention.

320
00:18:07,437 --> 00:18:10,359
I have regular emails and phone calls

321
00:18:10,439 --> 00:18:11,479
with their guild leader.

322
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,861
So the same kind of thing.

323
00:18:13,901 --> 00:18:16,062
And build a relationship with them because

324
00:18:17,647 --> 00:18:30,998
And again, building that relationship and maintaining that relationship with a group like that is important because I basically, through their guild leader, got a big chunk of that guild to just migrate from one product over to us.

325
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:43,710
And through working with them and maintaining that human contact, and for us, that's a really important thing, is like, go to their conventions, or go to conventions where you know they're going to be present and make that human contact.

326
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:52,736
And we've even, because, so I work with Richard Garriott, and he very much believes in extending

327
00:18:52,836 --> 00:18:54,177
the virtual to physical.

328
00:18:54,777 --> 00:19:02,582
And so we've even formalized community recognition, and so we have rewards we give out.

329
00:19:02,722 --> 00:19:05,725
And so one is that we stole from England.

330
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:08,206
So we have the, so they're in England.

331
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:11,669
You get the OBE, which is the Order of the Britannian Empire.

332
00:19:12,169 --> 00:19:16,592
So in our game, the land is called New Britannia, so we have the ONBE,

333
00:19:17,053 --> 00:19:21,336
which is a virtual medal and a title that you get in the game for your character,

334
00:19:21,636 --> 00:19:26,340
but there's literally a physical medal you get as well that we have like a ceremony where we pin it on you.

335
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,842
So like if we see you at a convention or you come to our offices,

336
00:19:29,882 --> 00:19:32,224
we actually give you the medal that you can wear when you go places.

337
00:19:33,185 --> 00:19:37,088
And that's for individuals who do outstanding contributions to the community.

338
00:19:37,769 --> 00:19:42,593
Either through running a website or a fan site or running events in the game.

339
00:19:43,133 --> 00:19:43,914
And then we have...

340
00:19:45,389 --> 00:19:48,692
what's called a royal warrant. Again, we stole it from England.

341
00:19:48,712 --> 00:19:52,956
And in England, the royal warrant is where like the queen will say,

342
00:19:52,996 --> 00:19:56,900
you know, you have a royal warrant to make cars or like, you know,

343
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,543
handbags. And so like, and when you get that royal warrant,

344
00:20:00,803 --> 00:20:04,547
you're recognized as the best person to make handbags in the land.

345
00:20:05,085 --> 00:20:08,527
And so we give royal warrants for groups.

346
00:20:08,867 --> 00:20:13,770
It's basically the equivalent of the ONBE, but for a guild or a group.

347
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:19,733
And so, like, the first one we gave out to was this group,

348
00:20:20,233 --> 00:20:24,236
the Bards of the Poet's Circle, who crowdsourced all the music for our game.

349
00:20:25,256 --> 00:20:28,638
And the reason we gave it to them was they...

350
00:20:30,019 --> 00:20:30,859
We had crowdsourced...

351
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:33,761
We had basically downloaded a bunch of free music from the Internet,

352
00:20:33,781 --> 00:20:34,441
and it was terrible.

353
00:20:35,019 --> 00:20:42,524
And they approached us and said, oh, your music's terrible, can we please fix it?

354
00:20:44,605 --> 00:20:45,906
Please make, can we make it better?

355
00:20:45,926 --> 00:20:50,029
Because we're a guild of musicians, and we're all sort of professional musicians,

356
00:20:50,069 --> 00:20:51,490
and we'd like to make music for the game.

357
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:55,800
And so we worked out this agreement, and we paid them licensing fees for it and everything.

358
00:20:56,541 --> 00:21:01,784
But they run this whole thing where they peer review it, and so we set up this whole thing

359
00:21:01,824 --> 00:21:05,846
of like, if you want to do crowdsourced music for the game, go through this guild.

360
00:21:06,426 --> 00:21:09,868
And so we gave them a royal warrant, and again, it's like this plaque that you can hang on

361
00:21:09,888 --> 00:21:10,768
your house in the game.

362
00:21:11,109 --> 00:21:16,031
Everyone that's in the guild gets that title, but there's also a physical wooden engraved

363
00:21:16,091 --> 00:21:19,913
plaque that the guild leader gets that they can hang on their house in the game.

364
00:21:20,754 --> 00:21:25,897
So again, we formalized this community recognition in a digital and a physical fashion.

365
00:21:26,217 --> 00:21:31,940
So we've sort of taken it to this kind of next level that has proven to be incredibly

366
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,143
powerful and sort of tied them even closer to us than we've ever seen.

367
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:39,881
I want to talk a little bit about talking to fansites themselves.

368
00:21:39,921 --> 00:21:43,745
We've already established that communication is extremely important, and I'm just going

369
00:21:43,765 --> 00:21:45,546
to list some of the ways that we communicate.

370
00:21:45,566 --> 00:21:47,668
You already talked about going to conventions and meetups.

371
00:21:48,429 --> 00:21:49,690
Email is an obvious one.

372
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:50,711
It's very easy to track.

373
00:21:51,251 --> 00:21:53,033
IM programs at Trion.

374
00:21:53,073 --> 00:21:54,414
We have Skype channels for...

375
00:21:54,794 --> 00:21:58,575
We have groups of fansites, we have people who we call the dimensioneers, and they're

376
00:21:58,615 --> 00:22:01,196
heavily involved in building stuff in the games.

377
00:22:01,796 --> 00:22:08,398
So Skype, Slack, AIM, I know people who are still using IRC, forums and PMs on forums,

378
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:11,920
sometimes we'll hand out the office phone to the community manager.

379
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,480
We try not to do it to the producers because they're just too busy.

380
00:22:15,565 --> 00:22:19,588
I hand out my personal cell phone to every fansite that I come in contact with because

381
00:22:19,628 --> 00:22:23,932
it's so much easier for me to answer a text from them than to go through the whole email

382
00:22:23,992 --> 00:22:24,432
process.

383
00:22:24,813 --> 00:22:28,616
Studio visits are also a big one, especially if your studio can afford to bring your best

384
00:22:28,676 --> 00:22:29,416
fansites in.

385
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:33,620
What types of communications work best for you when working with fansites?

386
00:22:34,901 --> 00:22:37,543
Describe a few of the challenges that you've had in communications.

387
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,801
I'm going to look at a couple depending on the product.

388
00:22:43,881 --> 00:22:48,025
So for a while I was working outside of gaming for a very short while.

389
00:22:48,305 --> 00:22:49,126
It's a weird world.

390
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:50,987
Then you got sucked right back in.

391
00:22:51,127 --> 00:22:54,870
I just realized you have to be far more appropriate when you don't work in gaming.

392
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:55,991
That's not acceptable.

393
00:22:56,011 --> 00:22:56,492
Not for me.

394
00:22:57,613 --> 00:23:03,437
But I worked on a community support site that was run by the community and it had 35 million

395
00:23:03,517 --> 00:23:07,140
unique visitors every month and it was run by volunteers.

396
00:23:07,881 --> 00:23:08,542
That kind of...

397
00:23:08,703 --> 00:23:13,544
So, the idea behind this constant change and high-level stuff is we would have a Slack call,

398
00:23:14,084 --> 00:23:18,465
not Slack call, Skype call every week with a PowerPoint deck.

399
00:23:18,585 --> 00:23:19,665
Can you tell I work at Microsoft?

400
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:24,567
And we would go through, like, here's the updates coming to the site this week, here's

401
00:23:24,587 --> 00:23:28,267
some, whatever, and then we'd have this whole dialogue with the leaders of the volunteers.

402
00:23:28,287 --> 00:23:29,408
And we'd do that every week.

403
00:23:29,988 --> 00:23:33,329
If I tried to do that to my team for some of my other products, they would kill me,

404
00:23:33,649 --> 00:23:35,249
because changes don't happen that quickly.

405
00:23:36,129 --> 00:23:37,550
And I overwork them.

406
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:38,010
So.

407
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:44,336
It depends on the product itself, but I have found that day in, day out, quick one-offs,

408
00:23:45,036 --> 00:23:47,397
emails, texts, I need to be available.

409
00:23:48,057 --> 00:23:50,078
Or rather, my team needs to be available.

410
00:23:50,218 --> 00:23:51,958
Yeah, make sure you phrase that carefully.

411
00:23:52,018 --> 00:23:53,498
I don't actually do anything.

412
00:23:54,859 --> 00:23:58,560
But when it comes down to it, all of that is great, but you still have to have, in my

413
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,100
opinion, that person-to-person...

414
00:24:01,605 --> 00:24:05,126
contact and I have some folks that are my canaries that will call me and say,

415
00:24:05,306 --> 00:24:08,988
um, have you checked Twitter? You know, those people who 12 o'clock

416
00:24:09,328 --> 00:24:11,049
in the middle of the night, I get a call and say, no, trust me,

417
00:24:11,189 --> 00:24:13,270
you want to log in that kind of stuff.

418
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:16,651
I need to have that kind of communication with my trusted community members

419
00:24:17,332 --> 00:24:19,173
because you know, they're all over the world.

420
00:24:19,773 --> 00:24:23,515
So it doesn't matter what time of day I've got people out there watching and

421
00:24:23,555 --> 00:24:25,195
letting me know when to freak out.

422
00:24:25,409 --> 00:24:26,809
That is actually a very good point.

423
00:24:26,949 --> 00:24:30,870
I used to, when I first started working in community professionally,

424
00:24:31,351 --> 00:24:34,431
I was kind of loath to give out my personal contact information

425
00:24:34,471 --> 00:24:38,212
because I didn't want these people bugging me, like bugging me for stuff.

426
00:24:39,713 --> 00:24:42,793
In retrospect, that was really stupid because when I finally started doing it,

427
00:24:43,113 --> 00:24:46,674
they were not bugging me, they were helping me at every single turn

428
00:24:47,034 --> 00:24:49,555
by alerting me to problems that were going on in the community

429
00:24:49,995 --> 00:24:53,476
or letting me know when somebody's running a really awesome contest and that sort of thing.

430
00:24:53,816 --> 00:24:58,401
So I had to let go of the fear of allowing that communication to operate on a very personal

431
00:24:58,461 --> 00:24:58,721
level.

432
00:24:59,182 --> 00:25:03,607
But, could you see it also getting out of control where it's taking over the working

433
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:06,890
day and the life of your community managers or whoever you've got assigned to it?

434
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:09,789
Well, you can't always be in reaction mode,

435
00:25:09,849 --> 00:25:10,850
and that's part of the problem.

436
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:12,870
So having those extra eyes out there

437
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:14,651
really helps you to focus on when

438
00:25:14,671 --> 00:25:17,371
you do need to get involved.

439
00:25:17,591 --> 00:25:21,032
The volume of negative is you want to drop it.

440
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:22,933
Drop what you're doing, change your priorities,

441
00:25:22,993 --> 00:25:25,013
focus on the right thing for the community and the game.

442
00:25:25,793 --> 00:25:28,494
But if things are going well, maybe all you do

443
00:25:28,554 --> 00:25:30,554
is monitor it and make sure that it's

444
00:25:30,614 --> 00:25:31,695
heading in the right direction.

445
00:25:32,555 --> 00:25:34,095
So a couple of things that we've done in the past

446
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:36,056
to help with communication, I come out

447
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,356
of a couple of small projects.

448
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:41,910
And usually as one of the first producers on the project, I'm the de facto community

449
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:42,310
manager.

450
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:46,491
So those first touches are often fall to me until we say, hey, we have enough volume to

451
00:25:46,571 --> 00:25:48,032
hire somebody to do it full-time.

452
00:25:48,372 --> 00:25:51,433
So I have to kind of squeeze it in between all the other things like shipping a game.

453
00:25:52,173 --> 00:25:59,955
And so we have done a couple of things like even setting up very specific aliases within

454
00:25:59,995 --> 00:26:01,876
our company that they know of, they can send to.

455
00:26:02,016 --> 00:26:03,496
So if they see something happening.

456
00:26:03,837 --> 00:26:07,418
There are certain people in the company that are automatically part of that alias, so we

457
00:26:07,478 --> 00:26:08,598
all automatically get it.

458
00:26:08,618 --> 00:26:09,938
So one of us can respond.

459
00:26:10,418 --> 00:26:15,300
And we kind of had a mini on-call for community because we didn't have a dedicated person

460
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,940
whose job was to do that.

461
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:21,402
So when you're in a smaller studio on a smaller project, you have to be a little more creative

462
00:26:21,582 --> 00:26:23,542
for monitoring that volume.

463
00:26:24,502 --> 00:26:30,064
And you don't want to be that person who wakes up at 7 o'clock to a thousand email messages,

464
00:26:30,124 --> 00:26:32,725
what the hell happened overnight, because you bothered to go to sleep.

465
00:26:33,326 --> 00:26:37,187
So anything you can do to kind of raise your awareness without trying to build out a team that,

466
00:26:37,867 --> 00:26:42,889
to what we said, can keep track of it around the clock worldwide, you just can't do it.

467
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:45,470
There is no sleep in the game industry.

468
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:50,932
Star, what are your favorite communication channels beyond going to the conventions and meeting people face-to-face?

469
00:26:51,647 --> 00:26:56,508
Um, you know, so we have our own, we have forums, um, and you know, we make sure that

470
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:57,589
we set up notifications.

471
00:26:57,669 --> 00:27:01,810
So if someone tags us in the forums or sends us a PM, that we'll get a notification that

472
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:02,450
that happened.

473
00:27:02,611 --> 00:27:07,532
And, and, uh, we make sure that people know that if they tag us or send us a PM that we'll

474
00:27:07,612 --> 00:27:09,373
respond within a certain amount of time.

475
00:27:10,153 --> 00:27:12,454
Um, you know, like Richard on Twitter.

476
00:27:13,156 --> 00:27:16,101
He literally will respond to every single tweet.

477
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:18,144
If you tweet a little secret...

478
00:27:18,184 --> 00:27:19,706
I'm totally going to test that right now.

479
00:27:19,947 --> 00:27:20,848
No, he will respond.

480
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:25,475
So if you tweet Richard Garriott on Twitter...

481
00:27:26,727 --> 00:27:28,368
No, seriously, he will respond.

482
00:27:28,728 --> 00:27:31,170
Like, he responds to every single tweet.

483
00:27:31,211 --> 00:27:34,794
Just like on our forums, I respond to every tag and every PM.

484
00:27:37,196 --> 00:27:40,979
And so we use, we sometimes give out email,

485
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,182
but most of the time we try to channel that communication in the forums.

486
00:27:44,222 --> 00:27:47,004
But we also are always on, you know, so we're also on Steam.

487
00:27:47,745 --> 00:27:49,526
So we're on those Steam forums.

488
00:27:51,082 --> 00:27:54,143
We also do Google Hangouts with our community.

489
00:27:54,223 --> 00:27:55,103
Do you?

490
00:27:56,583 --> 00:28:01,904
And we do a monthly live stream with our community.

491
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:06,685
And then quarterly, like, 12-hour Hangouts with the community.

492
00:28:08,926 --> 00:28:10,326
And so I think those are...

493
00:28:10,366 --> 00:28:11,946
Wait, wait, wait. 12-hour Hangout?

494
00:28:12,726 --> 00:28:14,007
How does that work?

495
00:28:14,387 --> 00:28:15,547
Are you there for the whole 12 hours?

496
00:28:15,567 --> 00:28:17,027
There's a lot of drinking involved.

497
00:28:17,087 --> 00:28:18,967
Okay, sign me up.

498
00:28:20,872 --> 00:28:24,234
Yeah, we've done some AMAs, you know, they focus on different disciplines.

499
00:28:24,254 --> 00:28:28,515
We'll get all the artists together and do an AMA for anything on the art side.

500
00:28:29,236 --> 00:28:32,357
Just lots of creative things to to kind of engage them in different ways.

501
00:28:32,637 --> 00:28:34,958
Yeah, those hangouts are basically AMAs.

502
00:28:34,978 --> 00:28:36,659
So we collect a bunch of questions ahead of time

503
00:28:37,459 --> 00:28:39,360
and then we answer those questions on air.

504
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,140
But we're also we use Discord.

505
00:28:41,801 --> 00:28:43,001
Right, Discord's terrific.

506
00:28:43,882 --> 00:28:47,383
And we're also collecting questions live while we're hanging out

507
00:28:47,443 --> 00:28:48,583
and answering those, too. So.

508
00:28:49,175 --> 00:28:54,016
So one thing I did on the live stream when we were working on Gigantic was the community

509
00:28:54,056 --> 00:28:58,737
was like they were live streaming from a show and I wasn't at the show, so I was home.

510
00:28:59,438 --> 00:29:03,319
And so what I did was I took all the questions that I knew they didn't have time to answer.

511
00:29:03,999 --> 00:29:07,940
So I would hop in if they were asking some information or if somebody said something

512
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:08,480
incorrectly.

513
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:10,807
So I was like, I know what's going on with the game.

514
00:29:10,847 --> 00:29:14,249
So I just said, I will just lurk and make sure that the

515
00:29:14,289 --> 00:29:16,871
data that's being portrayed either by the community, if

516
00:29:16,951 --> 00:29:18,111
they're getting it wrong, I'll fix it.

517
00:29:18,772 --> 00:29:20,493
If it's correct, I'll reinforce it.

518
00:29:20,973 --> 00:29:24,335
So that as you go back and look through the text chat

519
00:29:24,435 --> 00:29:26,676
afterwards, you actually are getting new information about

520
00:29:26,716 --> 00:29:27,837
what's going on with the game.

521
00:29:28,477 --> 00:29:30,518
And it was one of those things that I did kind of

522
00:29:30,598 --> 00:29:31,559
accidentally one time.

523
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:33,460
And then after that, community team was like,

524
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,562
when you're not at the show, can you make sure you do this worse?

525
00:29:35,602 --> 00:29:39,505
Because there was just so much less that they had to worry about, right?

526
00:29:39,966 --> 00:29:42,708
But they also knew, since I was working on the game all the time,

527
00:29:43,308 --> 00:29:46,631
I probably had the most relative information and

528
00:29:46,731 --> 00:29:49,913
most accurate for where we were in the production cycle for the game.

529
00:29:50,273 --> 00:29:52,236
Let's talk now about setting expectations.

530
00:29:52,396 --> 00:29:54,059
As you know, that's fairly important.

531
00:29:54,099 --> 00:29:58,605
A fansite, they're building, they've contacted you or you found them,

532
00:29:58,645 --> 00:30:00,929
they're very excited that you're paying attention to them.

533
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:05,996
I do think that it's important to set expectations as early as possible.

534
00:30:06,357 --> 00:30:11,298
Now, especially if you're dealing with some major huge fan sites, regardless of what platform

535
00:30:11,338 --> 00:30:18,141
they're on, and a couple of really small ones that are not really doing that well, sometimes

536
00:30:18,181 --> 00:30:21,542
those ones will expect just as much attention as the huge ones, and how we deal with that

537
00:30:21,582 --> 00:30:22,102
is important.

538
00:30:22,783 --> 00:30:24,965
How do we show support for our fansites in general?

539
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:30,773
We promote their stuff, we retweet them, we share on Facebook, we comment in response

540
00:30:30,813 --> 00:30:32,756
to their posts and what they're doing.

541
00:30:33,737 --> 00:30:38,223
Very often companies will offer free access to games or items and content that are in

542
00:30:38,243 --> 00:30:40,165
the games so that the fansites have...

543
00:30:41,307 --> 00:30:45,288
Unlimited access to everything that they want to comment and talk about.

544
00:30:45,828 --> 00:30:48,068
Star had already put in here and I should have put it in here too.

545
00:30:48,228 --> 00:30:50,889
Data feeds are extremely important to some fan sites.

546
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,870
Direct access to the community manager for questions.

547
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:59,231
Access to devs for information, even if it's indirect and must be requested through the community manager.

548
00:30:59,952 --> 00:31:03,954
We often provide support for contests and events that the fansites are running.

549
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:08,197
When we were developing Atlas Reactor, people kept asking about tournaments,

550
00:31:08,217 --> 00:31:10,899
and we said, well, we're not really sure if it's a tournament-style game.

551
00:31:11,299 --> 00:31:15,842
Here we are in Alpha, and the players are organizing tournaments through fansites,

552
00:31:15,883 --> 00:31:19,205
and that was a great eye-opener. You've got to support that sort of thing.

553
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:24,188
We offer people giveaways. Maybe the fansites are doing giveaways to their own fans.

554
00:31:24,789 --> 00:31:30,611
And also people are increasingly developing affiliate and profit-sharing programs with

555
00:31:30,691 --> 00:31:31,231
fan sites.

556
00:31:32,051 --> 00:31:36,333
So, panelists, do you have a formal outline for fan support that you give them?

557
00:31:36,393 --> 00:31:40,054
Like, here's what we'll do for you and here's our expectations?

558
00:31:40,794 --> 00:31:44,916
And what do you do if they request things a lot more than you are able to provide them?

559
00:31:45,156 --> 00:31:46,477
What if they start getting really demanding?

560
00:31:46,797 --> 00:31:48,997
So this goes back to what you were saying about...

561
00:31:51,334 --> 00:31:56,536
Can it go negative, having too much contact with your fansites, or having them have contact

562
00:31:56,556 --> 00:31:56,937
with us?

563
00:31:57,037 --> 00:32:02,019
Or how do you motivate your fansites to be a power for good and not evil?

564
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,841
It all goes back to how much value are you giving those fansites?

565
00:32:06,881 --> 00:32:10,923
Are you just expecting them to blow a horn and celebrate you, or are you providing them

566
00:32:10,963 --> 00:32:12,643
with quality?

567
00:32:13,562 --> 00:32:19,886
content or access and all that. If you set that up in the very beginning as part of that conversation of here's what we're going to provide you

568
00:32:21,107 --> 00:32:23,890
based on the fact that you have been identified as a top

569
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:31,215
fan site. And I'm real clear with people about what we can and cannot do. This will also evolve because just when you're like and this is what we're going to give you

570
00:32:31,235 --> 00:32:35,458
oh wait now there's streaming. Okay now we're going to give you this too. Oh wait now there's

571
00:32:36,459 --> 00:32:42,484
whatever's next. It will constantly evolve and change. But I'm very clear at the beginning to say here's how we're going to make you successful.

572
00:32:43,329 --> 00:32:44,450
They're doing us a favor.

573
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:47,192
We want to make sure we honor that and provide value.

574
00:32:47,813 --> 00:32:53,077
At the same time, there's real clear expectations out the go of, listen, if, you know, we were

575
00:32:53,097 --> 00:32:54,898
talking about this just the other night.

576
00:32:54,958 --> 00:32:58,041
If you retire and suddenly have a life and don't want to run your site anymore, we totally

577
00:32:58,061 --> 00:32:58,461
get that.

578
00:32:59,342 --> 00:33:00,483
That's not a further slide.

579
00:33:00,503 --> 00:33:01,404
You're skipping ahead.

580
00:33:01,884 --> 00:33:03,265
Cheating.

581
00:33:03,665 --> 00:33:05,307
But, you know, that's totally fine.

582
00:33:06,828 --> 00:33:09,770
They understand that it's a partnership based on mutual.

583
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:15,814
And that at some point we have to back off a little just because you're not as active.

584
00:33:16,715 --> 00:33:17,896
They know that in the very beginning.

585
00:33:17,936 --> 00:33:18,716
So it's not personal.

586
00:33:18,737 --> 00:33:24,101
And as long as you're honest and just open and transparent, people, they get it, right?

587
00:33:24,141 --> 00:33:26,863
I mean, people aren't, occasionally you got people who want everything for nothing.

588
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:28,585
But that's going to happen no matter what.

589
00:33:28,705 --> 00:33:33,689
I just, open communication and having it posted very clearly, and I actually like to post

590
00:33:33,709 --> 00:33:34,270
them publicly.

591
00:33:35,034 --> 00:33:38,456
Our fansite kind of policies of this is how you become a fansite, this is some of our

592
00:33:38,496 --> 00:33:39,217
expectations.

593
00:33:39,277 --> 00:33:41,378
Do you do that on your forums or on your website?

594
00:33:41,438 --> 00:33:42,078
I would do it on the site.

595
00:33:42,118 --> 00:33:42,659
On the site.

596
00:33:42,819 --> 00:33:45,480
Don't go look at my sites right now because they're not there right now because we're

597
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,201
still developing it.

598
00:33:46,321 --> 00:33:49,863
But, no, I think it should be very transparent because I don't want people to ever wonder

599
00:33:49,983 --> 00:33:51,964
how come you chose this site and not that site.

600
00:33:52,404 --> 00:33:55,146
It's just, quite honestly, most people get it, right?

601
00:33:55,186 --> 00:33:59,488
We're not new to the internet, but it's just always better to be as transparent as possible.

602
00:34:01,723 --> 00:34:06,291
Remember, most of us get involved in fan sites because we have a passion around that game, that title, that studio.

603
00:34:06,812 --> 00:34:07,754
And passion is personal.

604
00:34:08,375 --> 00:34:12,682
As much as you try and draw that line, as much as you try and keep that...

605
00:34:13,573 --> 00:34:17,577
kind of relationship where it needs to be on the business side, eventually it's going

606
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:19,818
to cross and you've got to be kind of really careful.

607
00:34:20,038 --> 00:34:23,861
So I mean, I'm blessed to have gotten to be really good friends with a whole bunch of

608
00:34:23,901 --> 00:34:26,223
folks I used to be, you know, on the other side of.

609
00:34:26,804 --> 00:34:30,987
But there are days when I have to remind them, I'm like, I work for this studio.

610
00:34:31,647 --> 00:34:35,070
This has to come first and so I need you to step back a little bit when we're in this

611
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:35,911
kind of relationship.

612
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:40,494
So just be careful because you do have to control that line sometimes because there

613
00:34:40,514 --> 00:34:42,756
are just some amazing people out there that you want to get to know.

614
00:34:43,209 --> 00:34:47,751
better, but they also have to respect what you do for the company and that there's some

615
00:34:47,791 --> 00:34:51,893
lines that you're not supposed to cross for both the business and personally to kind of

616
00:34:51,933 --> 00:34:54,075
keep things, you know, in the right place.

617
00:34:55,815 --> 00:34:57,656
Yeah, I mean, it's like we were talking about earlier.

618
00:34:57,676 --> 00:35:00,178
I mean, you just have to, it's kind of back to that ROI thing.

619
00:35:00,238 --> 00:35:06,221
You know, you just have to balance what kind of exposure and what kind of benefit are you

620
00:35:06,261 --> 00:35:08,062
deriving from that site.

621
00:35:08,162 --> 00:35:12,004
So I mean, if they're getting you a lot of exposure, if they're providing a lot of value

622
00:35:12,064 --> 00:35:12,724
to the community.

623
00:35:13,365 --> 00:35:20,709
Then whatever they're getting in response to that, whether it's Steam keys or store

624
00:35:20,789 --> 00:35:23,610
credit or things that they can give away.

625
00:35:24,171 --> 00:35:26,432
For us, an example is Twitch streamers.

626
00:35:27,413 --> 00:35:35,617
Again, because that's a big focus for us and most companies now.

627
00:35:36,658 --> 00:35:40,840
A big focus for most companies is giving Twitch streamers things they can give away during

628
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:41,400
their stream.

629
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:41,860
Right?

630
00:35:43,436 --> 00:35:48,905
The amount you give those streamers is directly proportional to the number of viewers they have, right?

631
00:35:49,005 --> 00:35:52,470
So, and again, just be super transparent about that.

632
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:56,977
It's like, if you have a big audience, I'm going to give you more store credit to give away.

633
00:35:57,803 --> 00:36:01,066
Right? And just say that. And everyone gets that.

634
00:36:01,286 --> 00:36:05,990
I mean, like, that's not a hard thing to communicate or sell, and everyone understands.

635
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:07,411
And that's perfectly fair.

636
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:13,397
Like, the nice thing about that is, like, it's a very fair metric, and it's a very objective metric.

637
00:36:13,577 --> 00:36:15,198
There's nothing subjective about it.

638
00:36:15,579 --> 00:36:16,479
You could just, so...

639
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:22,004
That's... And do you have a formal policy or outline posted as well?

640
00:36:22,024 --> 00:36:23,145
That would be super awesome.

641
00:36:24,264 --> 00:36:26,885
You'll get right on it when you get back to the office.

642
00:36:26,905 --> 00:36:27,765
Just borrow Jen's.

643
00:36:28,425 --> 00:36:31,346
At Tryon we have what we call the creator program.

644
00:36:31,486 --> 00:36:36,348
And we actually formalized it because we had so many Twitch streamers that we just couldn't handle.

645
00:36:36,668 --> 00:36:40,949
And it's a way that they can register so that we don't accidentally miss people.

646
00:36:41,349 --> 00:36:46,391
But then we started finding out that fansites should also be signing up for this because they deserve the same stuff.

647
00:36:46,811 --> 00:36:54,738
So we have wiki operators, reddit operators, fan sites, the Twitter guys, all of these people are now registered through the creator program.

648
00:36:55,018 --> 00:37:00,743
So we try to keep it short and concise, and one of the things we threw in there because of our friends at YouTube is,

649
00:37:01,164 --> 00:37:06,929
yes, you have permission to use our stuff freely and make money off it if you want to and can.

650
00:37:07,349 --> 00:37:10,932
So I think it's very useful to have something formal up.

651
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:17,075
And you mentioned the affiliate and proprietary stuff, which is a really new ground that's

652
00:37:17,095 --> 00:37:17,616
starting to happen.

653
00:37:17,796 --> 00:37:18,396
Very new.

654
00:37:18,777 --> 00:37:21,339
And we've actually got one example.

655
00:37:21,399 --> 00:37:29,366
We have what we call a trusted trader program because we actively allow a secondary market

656
00:37:29,546 --> 00:37:29,986
in our game.

657
00:37:30,026 --> 00:37:35,671
So we let players trade virtual goods for real dollars on their own.

658
00:37:36,312 --> 00:37:37,733
And so we have one.

659
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:44,395
person who's a trusted trainer who we let buy materials from our store and then sell

660
00:37:44,415 --> 00:37:45,936
them in a secondary market.

661
00:37:45,976 --> 00:37:47,457
He does it with Eve as well.

662
00:37:47,758 --> 00:37:47,938
Wow.

663
00:37:47,958 --> 00:37:48,038
Neat.

664
00:37:48,058 --> 00:37:49,839
Because Eve also has a similar program.

665
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:57,726
And, but again, it's profit sharing, so, and he, you know, he can buy things from us

666
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:02,610
at a discount and then resell them because we have a trusted relationship with him.

667
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:03,991
He gets his exposure.

668
00:38:04,492 --> 00:38:06,794
You know, he promotes the game on YouTube and Twitch.

669
00:38:09,001 --> 00:38:12,385
But it's a new thing, not a lot of companies are doing it yet.

670
00:38:12,545 --> 00:38:14,588
But it's a really interesting new model that's not starting to...

671
00:38:14,668 --> 00:38:17,652
I don't know how many of you saw the announcement from Twitch on Monday

672
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:19,535
that they're doing an affiliate program now.

673
00:38:20,216 --> 00:38:23,580
We're actually at Trion Worlds, we're lucky enough to be a partner in that.

674
00:38:23,941 --> 00:38:25,382
Let me tell you, this is so new.

675
00:38:25,843 --> 00:38:27,885
That we're not really sure how we're approaching it yet.

676
00:38:27,965 --> 00:38:32,008
Our platform guys are working with our sales guys, working with the brand guys, working with the devs.

677
00:38:32,428 --> 00:38:35,470
And everybody's trying to get this stuff cohesively together because

678
00:38:35,831 --> 00:38:39,153
affiliate programs can be a real bear to manage.

679
00:38:39,474 --> 00:38:42,616
So if we can get Twitch to do that for us, we're really happy.

680
00:38:42,936 --> 00:38:47,000
We're already partnered with Steam, and of course Steam takes a cut of the profit as well.

681
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:50,662
But the same sort of thing, you're reaching people that you wouldn't ever reach otherwise.

682
00:38:51,303 --> 00:38:55,706
I think affiliate programs are a really smart way to support fansites because they pour

683
00:38:55,746 --> 00:39:01,129
their life's blood into these endeavors and it's nice if they can get even a little bit

684
00:39:01,209 --> 00:39:01,430
back.

685
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:05,474
So before we move on real quick, one of the things that we ended up doing when we were

686
00:39:05,494 --> 00:39:11,282
working on Gigantic was we partnered with some of those fan sites and got a fit, they

687
00:39:11,322 --> 00:39:16,489
set up official tags for us so that when we posted they knew that we were officially part

688
00:39:16,529 --> 00:39:18,571
of the game and part of the company.

689
00:39:19,213 --> 00:39:26,700
And they did all this really fun stuff, but it meant that when we had the time to go in and comment on a thread or get involved in that conversation,

690
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:31,104
which we couldn't commit to doing all the time, they still knew we were there.

691
00:39:32,045 --> 00:39:32,565
That's great.

692
00:39:32,725 --> 00:39:36,169
And it just, you know, they were like, oh, wow, we didn't even know you guys were here.

693
00:39:36,189 --> 00:39:37,570
It's like, we're here, right?

694
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:44,496
We may not be able to post all the time because we do have day jobs, but, you know, when we do post, they know that we're engaged in the community and we're paying attention.

695
00:39:45,252 --> 00:39:47,973
And that's a form of currency to fansites as well.

696
00:39:48,053 --> 00:39:52,355
That's time investment from the company, and that is a form of payment and a thanks for

697
00:39:52,375 --> 00:39:53,135
a job well done.

698
00:39:53,816 --> 00:39:59,158
Most Reddit mods will also tag your team members if they verify their identity so that they

699
00:39:59,238 --> 00:40:03,100
know that you're not just pretending to be somebody from the company, but that you're

700
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:03,800
an actual person.

701
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:09,203
And then you get horribly downvoted to the bottom, you know, page ten, but at least you're

702
00:40:09,243 --> 00:40:10,524
tagged and people know that you're legit.

703
00:40:12,164 --> 00:40:15,365
Let's talk about one of the more challenging things, because this does happen.

704
00:40:15,845 --> 00:40:17,886
Biting the hand that feeds you.

705
00:40:18,466 --> 00:40:20,006
Sometimes a good thing goes bad.

706
00:40:20,687 --> 00:40:25,508
The passive one is, as we mentioned earlier, when people burn out and they move on.

707
00:40:25,848 --> 00:40:26,988
Or maybe they get a job.

708
00:40:27,188 --> 00:40:30,169
For instance, I ran a fan site for several years, thebrass.com,

709
00:40:30,549 --> 00:40:32,650
but when I started working in the game industry,

710
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:35,871
I no longer had time to do comics and write-ups and that sort of thing.

711
00:40:36,391 --> 00:40:41,234
So, the site might be abandoned or just left up on good terms, that sort of thing.

712
00:40:41,675 --> 00:40:47,779
However, sometimes when people get frustrated with you, it can result in a lot of burning

713
00:40:47,859 --> 00:40:52,562
bridges on their part and sometimes on the company's part, I'm sad to say.

714
00:40:53,843 --> 00:41:00,247
The second danger is that if you give fansites a lot, a sense of entitlement can form, just

715
00:41:00,307 --> 00:41:02,128
because they've got the special access.

716
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:06,631
Sometimes some people can develop a sense of self-importance.

717
00:41:07,011 --> 00:41:11,053
Sometimes they will have an increased level of demand that they feel entitled to.

718
00:41:11,693 --> 00:41:16,536
And if they're unhappy with you, they're going to vent to a very avid audience.

719
00:41:16,916 --> 00:41:20,658
That schadenfreude runs very strong among the people who read fan sites.

720
00:41:21,298 --> 00:41:25,761
So panel, have you encountered any of these issues and how did you resolve them?

721
00:41:26,061 --> 00:41:29,483
And how do you terminate an unhealthy fan site relationship?

722
00:41:29,863 --> 00:41:30,403
Well, all of the...

723
00:41:30,563 --> 00:41:33,966
Like when you guys, when you partnered with 4chan, you know, how did that turn out?

724
00:41:34,286 --> 00:41:39,330
Well, I'll leave the getting out of it to one of my fellow panelists, but I will tell

725
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:43,092
an interesting story from when I was actually on the other side and part of the community.

726
00:41:43,873 --> 00:41:46,435
I was running the Neverwinter Stratix site for about three years.

727
00:41:47,407 --> 00:41:49,187
I had an incredible relationship with Bioware.

728
00:41:49,667 --> 00:41:51,008
It felt like a real partnership.

729
00:41:51,828 --> 00:41:53,309
And I had to step away.

730
00:41:53,569 --> 00:41:57,411
I was actually starting up Mythica Stratix because I was super excited about that game.

731
00:41:57,751 --> 00:42:01,332
So I went to step out, but I was also building a bunch of stuff for the back end for Stratix,

732
00:42:01,572 --> 00:42:03,733
and I just didn't have the bandwidth to do both.

733
00:42:04,634 --> 00:42:09,977
And so what I ended up doing was I handed it off to somebody I felt was a really good lieutenant to hand it off to.

734
00:42:10,057 --> 00:42:13,299
Well, little did I know, he felt super entitled.

735
00:42:13,859 --> 00:42:17,662
He had not done any of the work to build a relationship with BioWare and the team,

736
00:42:18,242 --> 00:42:22,325
but he felt like he should just be able to step into my shoes and just have all that trust.

737
00:42:22,865 --> 00:42:26,147
And within three months, BioWare contacted me directly and said,

738
00:42:26,247 --> 00:42:29,769
if you do not take back this site, we're going to sever our relationship with you,

739
00:42:29,869 --> 00:42:31,550
because he was that bad.

740
00:42:32,491 --> 00:42:35,172
And the relationship that we had was too important.

741
00:42:35,352 --> 00:42:39,953
So we made him go away because he was actually damaging our

742
00:42:39,973 --> 00:42:42,054
community and the relationship with the company.

743
00:42:42,674 --> 00:42:45,455
And so I ended up stepping back in, and I stayed for another

744
00:42:45,475 --> 00:42:47,856
year until somebody else actually stepped up.

745
00:42:48,256 --> 00:42:51,517
But from the other side, it could have really destroyed

746
00:42:51,557 --> 00:42:54,358
our site because we had that tool that they were giving us

747
00:42:54,398 --> 00:42:58,899
data for, and it was a relationship that that stuff

748
00:42:58,939 --> 00:43:00,020
came out of the trust.

749
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:04,822
And as soon as somebody started to damage that trust, we needed to fix it immediately.

750
00:43:05,422 --> 00:43:09,204
So I haven't had that happen on the other side, so I'll leave that one to you guys.

751
00:43:10,064 --> 00:43:11,145
Have fire a fan site?

752
00:43:11,205 --> 00:43:11,565
Yes.

753
00:43:13,046 --> 00:43:16,087
So you can't fire a fan site.

754
00:43:16,267 --> 00:43:16,927
Correct.

755
00:43:17,388 --> 00:43:19,008
They're just gonna be there.

756
00:43:19,248 --> 00:43:26,032
So again, the key is to providing so much value that they want to play nice because you're in.

757
00:43:26,638 --> 00:43:29,319
and you have a trusting relationship with them and you all have the same goals.

758
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:34,942
And if they start to go sideways, pulling that stuff back should be felt.

759
00:43:35,022 --> 00:43:39,124
In other words, if the fansite, to your point, is getting value from the relationship with the company,

760
00:43:39,144 --> 00:43:41,745
they're going to want to reinforce that, just the same way that we do.

761
00:43:43,206 --> 00:43:47,628
The most you can do is actually pull back those resources and actually say,

762
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:51,310
acknowledge when people ask, unfortunately we severed our relationship with this fansite.

763
00:43:51,657 --> 00:43:54,879
And part of that is protecting your brand, right?

764
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:57,121
When somebody goes toxic and negative on the internet,

765
00:43:57,201 --> 00:43:58,021
which is so rare.

766
00:43:58,982 --> 00:43:59,542
Never happens.

767
00:43:59,642 --> 00:44:00,203
Never happens.

768
00:44:00,803 --> 00:44:03,265
Making sure that people understand we don't condone this.

769
00:44:04,506 --> 00:44:07,388
Even if obviously when it's blatant hate stuff,

770
00:44:07,528 --> 00:44:12,171
but even when it's just non-constructive and bitchy, right?

771
00:44:12,911 --> 00:44:13,632
You separate from it.

772
00:44:14,012 --> 00:44:16,113
And saying that publicly I think is important.

773
00:44:16,273 --> 00:44:17,314
You don't have to slander,

774
00:44:17,354 --> 00:44:19,596
but being able to say we no longer support this site.

775
00:44:20,402 --> 00:44:22,843
That's all you can do and not get pulled into the mud.

776
00:44:22,863 --> 00:44:25,444
Unless you have secrets.

777
00:44:28,825 --> 00:44:29,725
That's all you're going to say?

778
00:44:29,786 --> 00:44:33,787
Wow, 25 years in the industry and you don't have a cool story, bro?

779
00:44:33,827 --> 00:44:35,508
I mean, it's really that simple.

780
00:44:35,568 --> 00:44:38,709
You just have to make a public statement and say we're no longer working.

781
00:44:38,989 --> 00:44:41,050
I mean, you can't do anything else.

782
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:45,252
I mean, you can try and get them back on track.

783
00:44:46,133 --> 00:44:56,662
Like you said, by either pressure or demands or, you know, throttling back on supply.

784
00:44:57,343 --> 00:45:01,046
But at the end of the day, if it becomes, if that doesn't solve it, I mean, all you

785
00:45:01,066 --> 00:45:02,007
can do is make a public statement.

786
00:45:02,207 --> 00:45:04,249
I mean, there's no, there literally is nothing else you can do.

787
00:45:07,811 --> 00:45:09,332
But don't wait too long to do that.

788
00:45:10,052 --> 00:45:13,215
It becomes obvious that it's no longer a healthy relationship.

789
00:45:14,736 --> 00:45:16,897
I am amazed that we're actually on time with this.

790
00:45:16,937 --> 00:45:19,859
You guys are really good speakers. I'm going to have to sign you up again.

791
00:45:20,339 --> 00:45:24,622
The best advice, this is the last formal slide, and there are two parts.

792
00:45:25,263 --> 00:45:30,246
If there was one thing you could tell a community manager seeking to start a fansite program, it would be,

793
00:45:30,626 --> 00:45:31,547
and the second is,

794
00:45:31,907 --> 00:45:36,130
If there's one thing you'd like to tell execs reviewing your budget about the importance

795
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:39,573
of supporting fan sites, because that can be somewhat challenging as well.

796
00:45:39,953 --> 00:45:43,816
Now, as I put at the bottom, I said, okay, you can offer more than one piece of advice.

797
00:45:44,436 --> 00:45:48,439
If we were super concise and on track previously, chances are low I know you people.

798
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:50,000
So you surprised me.

799
00:45:50,341 --> 00:45:56,145
So what's your best advice to both somebody who wants to start a fan site program and

800
00:45:56,205 --> 00:45:59,948
something that you'd like to tell executives or offer to the community managers?

801
00:46:00,268 --> 00:46:01,769
that they can take to their executives.

802
00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:05,533
So I'll start with executives, because I work with executives.

803
00:46:06,734 --> 00:46:08,355
Look on your face when you say that.

804
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:08,815
What's that?

805
00:46:09,676 --> 00:46:10,837
Exactly.

806
00:46:11,538 --> 00:46:11,698
No.

807
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:15,742
They're out there whether you want them to be or not.

808
00:46:16,142 --> 00:46:18,164
They're out there and they're talking about our products.

809
00:46:18,224 --> 00:46:19,825
And they're giving out information.

810
00:46:19,845 --> 00:46:21,787
And they may be scraping data that's not accurate.

811
00:46:21,807 --> 00:46:24,129
And it may be coming from a good place.

812
00:46:24,189 --> 00:46:25,570
But they're out there one way or the other.

813
00:46:26,477 --> 00:46:34,062
Why would we not take advantage of that reach and that passion and that megaphone for the messaging we're trying to get across?

814
00:46:34,263 --> 00:46:35,604
Oh, and by the way, you don't have to pay them.

815
00:46:36,785 --> 00:46:39,767
So, if you really want to get tricky about it, what you say is,

816
00:46:40,467 --> 00:46:45,311
I can hire two people to go out and make sure we're hitting all these different community sites and getting this messaging out,

817
00:46:45,631 --> 00:46:49,994
or I can hire one person and start a fan program.

818
00:46:50,695 --> 00:46:52,737
It's cheaper, it's more effective, yada yada.

819
00:46:54,119 --> 00:47:00,584
And the feedback loop is huge. For us, that is huge. We want to hear from the fans, and not just the fans from Reddit, not just from Twitch, and not just...

820
00:47:01,125 --> 00:47:08,490
We cannot possibly be everywhere, but the fans are everywhere. So if we open up that communication loop, and we make sure that we're getting that information in,

821
00:47:09,471 --> 00:47:13,274
it's hugely valuable. Especially as, for instance, we announce a game.

822
00:47:15,338 --> 00:47:19,920
We do this big marketing splash with all these really pretty trailers and we think it hit great.

823
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:21,941
And the audience says, wow, that's awesome.

824
00:47:22,041 --> 00:47:24,162
We love that you're doing giant pink elephants.

825
00:47:24,182 --> 00:47:26,723
I'm like, there's no giant pink elephant.

826
00:47:26,743 --> 00:47:28,003
Like, how did they get that message?

827
00:47:28,423 --> 00:47:31,284
Sometimes what you put out there is not received the way that you think it is.

828
00:47:31,865 --> 00:47:37,967
Having that relationship with all these different places means I can now go to my execs and go, hey, remember how we said that?

829
00:47:38,407 --> 00:47:41,188
Well, now we have to shift our messaging because it's not landing.

830
00:47:41,768 --> 00:47:43,869
Otherwise, you're going to have pissed off players when we sell this game.

831
00:47:44,437 --> 00:47:47,519
That has proven to be extremely valuable for executives.

832
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:49,600
So they're working as a focus group as well.

833
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:50,680
That's another benefit.

834
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:52,401
A rather unfocused group, yes.

835
00:47:54,502 --> 00:47:55,483
But yeah, no, it's a huge benefit.

836
00:47:55,503 --> 00:47:58,184
And for, like I said, it's not expensive.

837
00:47:58,224 --> 00:48:02,646
The returns on it, if you have, so if you are going to set up, I'll go to the first

838
00:48:02,686 --> 00:48:04,908
question, if you are going to set up a program.

839
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:06,597
Have your ducks in a row.

840
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:08,138
Understand your reporting.

841
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:10,620
And reporting has to be consistent and constant.

842
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:12,661
There is no value if the community manager's

843
00:48:12,701 --> 00:48:14,303
the only one with the information in their brain.

844
00:48:14,463 --> 00:48:18,646
It has to be put in a concise bullet point template

845
00:48:18,946 --> 00:48:21,568
that an exec over lunch or coffee can go, got it.

846
00:48:21,909 --> 00:48:23,630
Because then they're getting value out of it.

847
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:25,411
And if you're not doing that on a consistent basis,

848
00:48:25,692 --> 00:48:30,115
and taking the passion out of the communication

849
00:48:30,155 --> 00:48:31,176
and making it actionable.

850
00:48:32,258 --> 00:48:38,563
That's huge. But you want to have all that in place so that by the time you go out, within the first week of a program existing, people are seeing value.

851
00:48:46,281 --> 00:48:49,542
Going to be setting up a program, I'm going to echo what you said,

852
00:48:49,642 --> 00:48:55,423
that having a very digestible report for executive

853
00:48:56,043 --> 00:48:58,164
to understand what's happening in the community.

854
00:48:58,244 --> 00:49:01,565
So I'm going to single out Barik, or Matthew Anderson, our community guy out there.

855
00:49:01,925 --> 00:49:05,846
He, you know, so he does a weekly report, it's called our Community Sentiment Report.

856
00:49:06,606 --> 00:49:10,707
It divides the community into different areas, like here's our community on Steam,

857
00:49:10,767 --> 00:49:14,628
here's our community on our forums, here's the community in other locations,

858
00:49:14,728 --> 00:49:15,948
like, ooh, yay, Reddit.

859
00:49:18,059 --> 00:49:20,742
And then sort of rates how they're doing

860
00:49:20,802 --> 00:49:22,904
and then talks about what they're talking about,

861
00:49:23,364 --> 00:49:26,147
but then also gives suggested actions based on that thing.

862
00:49:26,467 --> 00:49:27,188
But it's all one page.

863
00:49:28,683 --> 00:49:33,165
And that comes out right before our weekly managers meeting.

864
00:49:33,825 --> 00:49:42,408
So as an agenda item, we have that list of both sentiment and actionable items from what is going on in the community and the fans.

865
00:49:42,768 --> 00:49:48,991
So having that data in a very digestible and actionable format is critical for that.

866
00:49:49,578 --> 00:49:52,121
for exec and leadership to see value.

867
00:49:52,261 --> 00:49:54,683
And that has to, so if you're setting up that program,

868
00:49:55,064 --> 00:49:58,967
make sure that that's the end result of it, right?

869
00:49:59,068 --> 00:50:02,551
Is this digestible, actionable data coming out of it,

870
00:50:02,671 --> 00:50:03,752
or else there's no point.

871
00:50:04,173 --> 00:50:05,494
It's the actual pitch itself.

872
00:50:05,574 --> 00:50:07,076
Yeah, that's what you're pitching.

873
00:50:07,396 --> 00:50:09,378
So if you're gonna pitch, like, I want to set up this program,

874
00:50:10,019 --> 00:50:10,960
that's your pitch.

875
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:12,441
It's like, this is the report you're gonna get.

876
00:50:13,279 --> 00:50:15,681
Because if that's your pitch, like you show them that report,

877
00:50:15,701 --> 00:50:16,943
they're going to be like, oh, awesome.

878
00:50:17,603 --> 00:50:19,945
But then the other part of your pitch is, you know,

879
00:50:20,826 --> 00:50:23,449
just a simple data point, which is the cost of user acquisition.

880
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:26,472
So, you know, the average revenue per user right now is

881
00:50:26,492 --> 00:50:28,193
about a dollar, right?

882
00:50:28,974 --> 00:50:30,876
Okay, so let everyone let that sink in for a second.

883
00:50:30,896 --> 00:50:33,919
You're getting about a dollar per person right now.

884
00:50:34,199 --> 00:50:36,441
The cost of user acquisition right now is about $5.

885
00:50:39,809 --> 00:50:43,784
See that? How that works? So you're losing about four dollars a person.

886
00:50:45,041 --> 00:50:47,362
Okay, so which means you need to scale.

887
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:49,822
And the only way you can scale, you're not gonna scale

888
00:50:50,323 --> 00:50:52,323
through traditional, no longer can you scale

889
00:50:52,343 --> 00:50:54,324
through traditional marketing techniques, right?

890
00:50:55,224 --> 00:50:59,065
Unless you're like Supercell and you have $26 billion, right?

891
00:50:59,525 --> 00:51:03,566
So if you're anybody else, you need other techniques

892
00:51:03,626 --> 00:51:06,347
and the best way to do that is with community, right?

893
00:51:06,427 --> 00:51:08,248
And so they are your user,

894
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:10,829
they are an amazing user acquisition tool.

895
00:51:10,909 --> 00:51:12,009
And so that's your other pitch.

896
00:51:12,529 --> 00:51:19,491
Right? Is community is a user acquisition tool and by fostering a community and helping a community,

897
00:51:20,111 --> 00:51:22,991
that's the way we're going to do it.

898
00:51:23,712 --> 00:51:31,113
And one last thing is, you know, if you're setting up a program, you know, always be transparent and honest.

899
00:51:33,114 --> 00:51:37,435
That's key to any program. Like, be open and honest with your community.

900
00:51:37,995 --> 00:51:41,676
And be clear about what works and what doesn't with your community.

901
00:51:42,276 --> 00:51:42,356
Um...

902
00:51:43,157 --> 00:51:46,679
and recognize the outstanding contributors.

903
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,162
So people who are, but don't do that

904
00:51:50,262 --> 00:51:53,505
until they consistently display positive contribution.

905
00:51:54,005 --> 00:51:57,068
Like if someone is doing something really awesome

906
00:51:57,088 --> 00:51:59,530
for like a day, don't immediately jump out there

907
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:01,492
and go, look at that person who did one day

908
00:52:01,552 --> 00:52:02,472
of really awesome things.

909
00:52:03,093 --> 00:52:06,057
Wait till they like do months of really awesome things.

910
00:52:06,437 --> 00:52:12,525
But once they consistently display something positive over months of time,

911
00:52:12,946 --> 00:52:14,168
publicly recognize them.

912
00:52:14,788 --> 00:52:17,151
Show the community, this is what we like.

913
00:52:18,052 --> 00:52:24,076
This person right here or this group is the kind of community contribution, this is the

914
00:52:24,136 --> 00:52:27,619
fan site we like, and celebrate that to the rest of the community.

915
00:52:27,879 --> 00:52:31,943
Because then the rest of the community has an example to work from and they can say,

916
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:35,465
oh, those are the guys who are doing really awesome work and they got lots of goodies

917
00:52:35,505 --> 00:52:35,946
because of it.

918
00:52:37,292 --> 00:52:38,813
It is. But it works.

919
00:52:40,054 --> 00:52:42,036
All right. Just a couple minutes left, I guess.

920
00:52:42,296 --> 00:52:46,179
So from the executive point, it's, you know, I had to make this pitch

921
00:52:46,219 --> 00:52:50,302
because I was starting to lose my ability to actually run the project as a producer.

922
00:52:50,749 --> 00:52:54,110
So I was part of helping make that pitch to say we need somebody to do this.

923
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:57,791
We've got so many people paying attention to us and I can't deliver the quality

924
00:52:57,831 --> 00:52:59,892
that we need to kind of keep that message on task.

925
00:53:00,372 --> 00:53:04,973
But also to echo Star, we're both, the community managers both acquisition and

926
00:53:05,033 --> 00:53:06,254
retention, right?

927
00:53:06,774 --> 00:53:10,095
They're kind of keep the, that's where the care and feeding of that passion comes

928
00:53:10,175 --> 00:53:11,335
in at the community side.

929
00:53:11,835 --> 00:53:14,496
So they're going to help us acquire, but they're also going to retain.

930
00:53:15,136 --> 00:53:17,277
And if they don't play, they don't pay.

931
00:53:18,474 --> 00:53:20,576
So we need to keep them around once we have them.

932
00:53:20,636 --> 00:53:27,300
And the community manager is one of those glue elements to the future of our game and making service data.

933
00:53:27,441 --> 00:53:32,884
And as for the advice piece, is don't forget that as building community outside the studio,

934
00:53:32,944 --> 00:53:35,346
you're also building the community inside the studio.

935
00:53:35,726 --> 00:53:39,729
Because you are basing a lot of the things you're doing on the people who build that game.

936
00:53:40,567 --> 00:53:44,328
And being aware that those kinds of things impact that group,

937
00:53:44,468 --> 00:53:46,188
some of them won't want to do those streams.

938
00:53:46,929 --> 00:53:48,649
But I had the blessing of working

939
00:53:48,669 --> 00:53:50,389
with amazing community managers who were really

940
00:53:50,429 --> 00:53:51,750
stressful time on our project.

941
00:53:52,590 --> 00:53:54,750
And the fact that he supported me

942
00:53:54,930 --> 00:53:56,871
allowed him, gave me the opportunity

943
00:53:56,891 --> 00:53:57,731
to support him even more.

944
00:53:58,411 --> 00:53:59,732
And it was an amazing partnership

945
00:53:59,832 --> 00:54:01,872
between production and community in my studio,

946
00:54:01,892 --> 00:54:02,732
and I felt really blessed.

947
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:04,333
Great.

948
00:54:04,793 --> 00:54:05,213
And now.

949
00:54:06,156 --> 00:54:07,438
Do we still have time for questions?

950
00:54:07,999 --> 00:54:08,519
Yeah, we have.

951
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:08,900
OK.

952
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,043
So if anybody has any questions, please line up

953
00:54:11,083 --> 00:54:11,744
at the microphone.

954
00:54:13,165 --> 00:54:15,188
Thank you so much, panel, for taking part in this.

955
00:54:15,208 --> 00:54:16,109
You guys are really brilliant.

956
00:54:22,168 --> 00:54:27,211
Hi, thanks guys. I'm Nick Huggett from KickSci. We've made a big push into mobile gaming. One

957
00:54:27,231 --> 00:54:31,132
of the big things that we've seen is that our players like to communicate through messaging

958
00:54:31,252 --> 00:54:37,135
apps including Line. And one of the kind of roadblocks we've run into is that I was a

959
00:54:37,195 --> 00:54:40,656
part of a bunch of different chats and a couple of them basically decided they didn't want

960
00:54:40,676 --> 00:54:42,837
the company to be able to communicate with the player. So we've made a big push into

961
00:54:43,163 --> 00:54:46,785
overseeing or seeing what they were talking about and basically

962
00:54:46,806 --> 00:54:49,708
kicked me out. So not because of anything I did, they just didn't

963
00:54:49,748 --> 00:54:51,869
like the feeling of big brother looking over top. So my

964
00:54:51,909 --> 00:54:55,051
question is, if you're in a situation like that, you want to

965
00:54:55,091 --> 00:54:57,373
be part of some of these talks that some of your players are

966
00:54:57,393 --> 00:55:00,095
having, but not that they hate you, they just don't want you

967
00:55:00,155 --> 00:55:04,458
looking over their shoulder. Do you respect that and and just

968
00:55:04,478 --> 00:55:08,621
let them do it? Or do you infiltrate and try and, you

969
00:55:08,641 --> 00:55:11,223
know, pretend to be one of the players? Like there's a couple

970
00:55:11,243 --> 00:55:12,724
of different avenues. What's your advice?

971
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:15,742
You're asking if we want to advocate spying on your community?

972
00:55:15,762 --> 00:55:17,303
You guys, you go ahead and take that.

973
00:55:17,463 --> 00:55:19,324
Absolutely.

974
00:55:19,384 --> 00:55:19,765
No.

975
00:55:19,925 --> 00:55:20,305
Don't?

976
00:55:20,365 --> 00:55:20,685
Don't spy.

977
00:55:20,725 --> 00:55:21,346
I'm asking what you would do.

978
00:55:21,366 --> 00:55:22,246
Yeah, well, I'm asking what you would do.

979
00:55:22,266 --> 00:55:24,948
Yeah, the price you pay is greater than what you're going to pay.

980
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:26,989
They will find out you're spying, so don't do it.

981
00:55:27,049 --> 00:55:30,492
So instead, just kind of approach them and say, can you guys give us just kind of an

982
00:55:30,592 --> 00:55:31,292
overview report?

983
00:55:31,312 --> 00:55:32,413
We don't need to see the details.

984
00:55:32,913 --> 00:55:33,474
Just give us...

985
00:55:33,514 --> 00:55:34,574
Tell us what you come up with.

986
00:55:34,614 --> 00:55:36,816
Tell them what you're talking about, the things that matter to you guys.

987
00:55:36,836 --> 00:55:39,237
We don't have to be there to get that information.

988
00:55:39,998 --> 00:55:42,180
Well, there's a reason why they're having the conversation.

989
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:43,782
There's a reason why they're having those conversations.

990
00:55:43,822 --> 00:55:46,644
And it may be that they want to be able to vent without you hearing.

991
00:55:47,205 --> 00:55:48,226
And that's fine.

992
00:55:48,706 --> 00:55:50,388
But that's not what you need anyway.

993
00:55:50,708 --> 00:55:53,071
You need actual feedback that's actionable.

994
00:55:53,451 --> 00:55:55,293
And so the people that are running those chats, to your point,

995
00:55:55,313 --> 00:55:57,215
if they can give you some talking points, that's great.

996
00:55:57,555 --> 00:55:59,717
Otherwise, you may need to start your own.

997
00:56:00,569 --> 00:56:05,735
Or have another group that you can incentivize to start one on your behalf.

998
00:56:05,775 --> 00:56:07,517
And incentivize is again very transparent.

999
00:56:07,778 --> 00:56:13,264
It's a, hey, we would love to, we'll even give you some tokens to give out during your chat.

1000
00:56:13,385 --> 00:56:15,547
But the goal is we want feedback.

1001
00:56:15,687 --> 00:56:16,268
We want.

1002
00:56:17,468 --> 00:56:19,810
Amplification, whatever your goal is, just be really transparent.

1003
00:56:20,491 --> 00:56:25,295
But with things like that, it also becomes really gamey, which is, you know,

1004
00:56:25,376 --> 00:56:27,918
I mean, it becomes this weird, well, we said, well, we think.

1005
00:56:27,958 --> 00:56:30,280
It's like, that's not, no, we're doing everything above board.

1006
00:56:30,341 --> 00:56:32,383
If you're not comfortable and you just want to rant, go for it.

1007
00:56:32,463 --> 00:56:33,764
That's not something that's useful for me.

1008
00:56:34,208 --> 00:56:38,531
And I think the end goal here is you're trying to make sure that once you build the trust

1009
00:56:38,551 --> 00:56:40,172
with the community, you keep it, right?

1010
00:56:40,292 --> 00:56:43,914
So being transparent about not invading their space if they don't feel comfortable.

1011
00:56:44,555 --> 00:56:48,657
Because if they truly feel that they can trust you and you can trust them, you're going to

1012
00:56:48,677 --> 00:56:53,360
hear about that stuff faster than the tide of it getting out on the internet.

1013
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,782
And that's what you want to build your relationship on, is that trust.

1014
00:56:56,162 --> 00:56:57,683
You're going to be transparent, like Jen said.

1015
00:56:57,963 --> 00:56:58,584
Be transparent.

1016
00:56:58,904 --> 00:57:02,286
Say, hey, we want to join you guys, but we'll respect you if you guys don't want us there.

1017
00:57:03,147 --> 00:57:03,967
Also, that's so weird.

1018
00:57:06,403 --> 00:57:11,966
It's not. There are a lot of sites out there where people, where honestly devs don't want to go.

1019
00:57:12,426 --> 00:57:22,971
But as, no I'm serious. There was EQ2 Flames for instance was a fansite forum that was started as a place for people to go rant and rave.

1020
00:57:23,451 --> 00:57:26,993
And we did not have our developers posting there, because remember that a developer's

1021
00:57:27,053 --> 00:57:28,454
presence is also a reward.

1022
00:57:29,155 --> 00:57:31,396
Do not underestimate the power of your developers.

1023
00:57:31,496 --> 00:57:36,459
If you start a weekly chat and invite everybody to it, do not underestimate the power of developers

1024
00:57:36,499 --> 00:57:38,421
to pull in people who are really interested in your game.

1025
00:57:38,441 --> 00:57:39,481
So just go start your own.

1026
00:57:39,882 --> 00:57:40,082
Yeah.

1027
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:42,583
Next question.

1028
00:57:43,075 --> 00:57:46,459
Hi, my name is Liz. I work at Pocket Gems on a product called Episode.

1029
00:57:46,779 --> 00:57:51,725
We actually have a ton of fan sites, but one of the issues that we're running into is that

1030
00:57:52,926 --> 00:57:56,150
the fan site operators actually kind of hate each other.

1031
00:57:57,532 --> 00:57:59,815
Oh, yeah. That happens.

1032
00:57:59,895 --> 00:58:03,399
So, what advice or insights do you have on dealing with situations like that?

1033
00:58:04,472 --> 00:58:06,814
I'm going to repeat the question for the audio.

1034
00:58:06,834 --> 00:58:08,616
What do you do when your fansite operators hate each other?

1035
00:58:15,994 --> 00:58:22,598
So back in the day when I did have fan sites who hated mine, we actually had to learn to

1036
00:58:22,658 --> 00:58:25,700
build, I mean, the companies were not going to fix this for us.

1037
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:30,342
We actually eventually arranged an agreement of respect.

1038
00:58:30,362 --> 00:58:34,365
It was like, if you're going to go steal our content, damn it, give us credit, right?

1039
00:58:34,825 --> 00:58:38,187
So it was kind of, we had to work out, because it was in the early days of this, right?

1040
00:58:38,548 --> 00:58:41,890
And so you know you got these unique screenshots or data from the

1041
00:58:42,430 --> 00:58:46,333
But the game company or whatever, the studio, and all of a sudden it appeared on somebody

1042
00:58:46,353 --> 00:58:46,834
else's site.

1043
00:58:47,374 --> 00:58:48,135
And they didn't credit you.

1044
00:58:48,155 --> 00:58:51,157
I was like, I don't care if you cross post, have a good time.

1045
00:58:51,497 --> 00:58:55,080
Just tell them where it came from so that we get acknowledged for that effort, right?

1046
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:58,263
So a lot of it was just building respect between us.

1047
00:58:58,823 --> 00:59:02,166
And it had nothing to do with the company itself, right?

1048
00:59:02,386 --> 00:59:03,768
And it's like, come on, be grownups.

1049
00:59:04,308 --> 00:59:08,091
Let me ask in turn, are they coming to you to come solve their squabbles?

1050
00:59:09,252 --> 00:59:11,554
So my community is primarily teen girls.

1051
00:59:12,983 --> 00:59:14,105
Oh, wow.

1052
00:59:15,847 --> 00:59:17,329
So we're talking frenemies here.

1053
00:59:17,390 --> 00:59:18,211
Is that where we are?

1054
00:59:19,292 --> 00:59:19,613
OK.

1055
00:59:20,774 --> 00:59:23,899
So it's like really hard to deal with.

1056
00:59:24,199 --> 00:59:25,240
But are they coming to you?

1057
00:59:25,958 --> 00:59:27,478
In some cases, yes.

1058
00:59:27,658 --> 00:59:30,819
In some cases, it's, did you know that so-and-so is doing this?

1059
00:59:30,859 --> 00:59:31,799
You need to ban them.

1060
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:33,240
That's great.

1061
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:35,901
I've heard that a lot.

1062
00:59:36,061 --> 00:59:37,141
Yeah, yeah.

1063
00:59:37,161 --> 00:59:39,201
Believe me, it's not just teen girls that do that, by the way.

1064
00:59:39,282 --> 00:59:40,542
It's not just teen girls.

1065
00:59:40,602 --> 00:59:42,042
No, no, no.

1066
00:59:42,102 --> 00:59:45,043
I would actually, we take the high road, right?

1067
00:59:45,163 --> 00:59:48,564
And we illustrate adult behavior, at least in public.

1068
00:59:48,984 --> 00:59:55,051
So when people are coming to us with those kind of complaints, it's like, well, as long

1069
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:56,252
as we're within the guidelines.

1070
00:59:57,433 --> 00:59:58,415
You start sounding like a...

1071
00:59:59,259 --> 01:00:04,784
Pamphlet or something but to some extent not adding to the drama and not even getting your toe in the water is so important

1072
01:00:04,804 --> 01:00:07,766
Yeah, because you just don't want to reinforce that behavior no matter who it is

1073
01:00:08,847 --> 01:00:12,530
And then it does get to the point where you just remind people there are in order to be

1074
01:00:13,211 --> 01:00:17,054
Acknowledged by us again, make sure you have a carrot make sure you have some kind of value

1075
01:00:17,654 --> 01:00:21,898
You have to be behaving within this code of conduct and the code of conduct is important

1076
01:00:21,918 --> 01:00:24,300
We haven't touched on that but a code of conduct is important

1077
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:30,142
And outlining in the very beginning, we will not tolerate hate, we will not tolerate toxicity,

1078
01:00:30,182 --> 01:00:31,882
we will not, all that stuff is part of that.

1079
01:00:32,403 --> 01:00:35,524
And then just pointing to it saying as long as we're okay here, okay, thanks, bye.

1080
01:00:35,964 --> 01:00:37,164
And just not getting too involved.

1081
01:00:37,404 --> 01:00:41,146
You'll find that they will grow up over time or they'll go someplace else too.

1082
01:00:41,906 --> 01:00:46,728
And when I say grow up, a lot of times it's adults who start these fan sites and they

1083
01:00:46,828 --> 01:00:49,889
also have to adjust to that social environment.

1084
01:00:49,989 --> 01:00:51,390
Definitely not just teenage kids.

1085
01:00:51,710 --> 01:00:53,331
I think we have time for one more question.

1086
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:54,351
Okay.

1087
01:00:55,945 --> 01:00:58,867
Hello, I'm Rafael from Blizzard Latin America.

1088
01:00:59,187 --> 01:00:59,847
Hello!

1089
01:01:00,548 --> 01:01:05,730
So, usually we get limited spots to bring people to workshops in the office or to conventions

1090
01:01:05,770 --> 01:01:06,550
like BlizzCon.

1091
01:01:07,011 --> 01:01:10,712
So, how do you guys value who should come?

1092
01:01:10,772 --> 01:01:14,394
Like a bigger fansite or a small one that you want to help grow?

1093
01:01:15,214 --> 01:01:19,056
And a follow-up question, how do you guys handle the jealousy between fansites?

1094
01:01:19,116 --> 01:01:22,118
Like, why did he get an invite and I didn't?

1095
01:01:23,623 --> 01:01:27,204
Star had a really good response to this earlier where you were evaluating fan sites.

1096
01:01:28,004 --> 01:01:34,766
You know, so again, being transparent about it, so communicating why you made the decision.

1097
01:01:35,346 --> 01:01:42,068
So if you make the decision that you want to bring a smaller fan site for the purpose of growing them and helping them,

1098
01:01:42,688 --> 01:01:45,569
just say that is why you did it, right?

1099
01:01:45,909 --> 01:01:46,289
And so, um...

1100
01:01:47,689 --> 01:01:51,932
Or if you made the decision that you only want to bring web fan sites that are of a

1101
01:01:51,992 --> 01:01:55,794
certain scale because they have a certain exposure, but just be clear that that was

1102
01:01:55,814 --> 01:01:56,454
the criteria.

1103
01:01:56,635 --> 01:01:59,196
Or if you did a mix, also say that.

1104
01:01:59,536 --> 01:02:04,999
Say we chose two web, two fan sites that were of this scale because they had this exposure

1105
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:11,363
of this many views per whatever, that metric, and then we intentionally reserved two slots

1106
01:02:11,423 --> 01:02:13,585
for smaller up-and-coming sites.

1107
01:02:14,745 --> 01:02:16,187
And just be transparent about that.

1108
01:02:16,487 --> 01:02:17,928
And yes, you're going to get jealousy.

1109
01:02:18,049 --> 01:02:19,230
I mean, that's going to happen.

1110
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:23,354
But if you are very transparent about why you chose those,

1111
01:02:23,374 --> 01:02:23,634
and

1112
01:02:26,590 --> 01:02:30,212
If you did it by, say, a lottery or something like that,

1113
01:02:30,992 --> 01:02:32,412
like the two smaller ones,

1114
01:02:33,293 --> 01:02:38,094
we chose the two biggest, and that's an objective metric.

1115
01:02:38,534 --> 01:02:41,435
And then for your two smaller ones, say,

1116
01:02:41,755 --> 01:02:45,556
we chose ten smaller ones,

1117
01:02:45,817 --> 01:02:48,177
and we randomly picked two out of those ten smaller ones.

1118
01:02:49,258 --> 01:02:51,518
And then, again, if you're transparent about it...

1119
01:02:52,694 --> 01:02:55,676
They're going to get jealous and they're going to have some

1120
01:02:56,096 --> 01:02:58,858
foment about it for a little while, but if you were

1121
01:02:58,938 --> 01:03:02,660
transparent about it, that won't last that long.

1122
01:03:05,635 --> 01:03:09,036
And I do agree, by the way, the combination is the best, right?

1123
01:03:09,236 --> 01:03:09,356
Yes.

1124
01:03:09,376 --> 01:03:13,518
If we only feed our big, giant fan sites, everybody else gives up.

1125
01:03:13,778 --> 01:03:16,980
And suddenly you are dependent on two sites, right?

1126
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:22,682
You always want to have the up-and-comer that is building, has new perspective, fills a

1127
01:03:22,722 --> 01:03:24,243
niche maybe that isn't already filled.

1128
01:03:24,683 --> 01:03:29,345
But it also helps with the entitlement when it's not just two juggernauts or one juggernaut

1129
01:03:29,365 --> 01:03:29,905
fan site.

1130
01:03:31,246 --> 01:03:34,907
They become a little less cocky if they realize they're not the only show in town.

1131
01:03:36,336 --> 01:03:40,204
And the silver lining is you have several fan sites to be jealous of each other.
