1
00:00:05,158 --> 00:00:08,569
Hi, I'm Jason Rohr, and I'm just gonna start

2
00:00:08,589 --> 00:00:09,331
giving my talk now.

3
00:00:11,407 --> 00:00:15,530
So, this talk is about, well, let me start my stopwatch

4
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:16,210
and I'll go over time.

5
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,692
Hopefully there'll be some time for questions at the end

6
00:00:18,712 --> 00:00:20,253
because I've timed this to about 25 minutes.

7
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:24,236
So, this is a talk that's primarily about financial results.

8
00:00:24,296 --> 00:00:25,377
It's kind of a money talk.

9
00:00:25,437 --> 00:00:26,818
It's a strange talk for me to give.

10
00:00:27,298 --> 00:00:28,479
And I know that some people in this room

11
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:30,280
are sort of just getting started in their career

12
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,422
as independent game developers.

13
00:00:32,802 --> 00:00:34,904
And I don't want to give any of you a false impression

14
00:00:35,724 --> 00:00:37,005
because I've been doing this for 15 years.

15
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:39,987
I'm kind of an old man in the room at this point, right?

16
00:00:40,027 --> 00:00:41,789
And I've made 19 games over that time.

17
00:00:42,469 --> 00:00:44,131
And a lot of the results I'm going to be showing

18
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:46,532
are comparing my 17th game to my 19th game.

19
00:00:47,153 --> 00:00:49,455
But when you see these results, keep in mind

20
00:00:49,535 --> 00:00:52,097
that I made no money at all in games

21
00:00:52,117 --> 00:00:53,718
when I was working in games for the first six years.

22
00:00:54,138 --> 00:00:55,940
In fact, it wasn't until my 14th game

23
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,981
that I made any real money at all.

24
00:00:58,522 --> 00:01:00,383
I'll say it again just to make sure it sinks in.

25
00:01:00,403 --> 00:01:03,285
I made 13 games in a row without making any money.

26
00:01:05,387 --> 00:01:06,868
So you really got to view success in games.

27
00:01:06,948 --> 00:01:08,869
Potentially, I mean, there's a lot of, you know,

28
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:10,550
first game hit stories, right?

29
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,131
But in general, success in games

30
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:14,172
can be this long-term project, right?

31
00:01:14,793 --> 00:01:16,034
Success takes time to build.

32
00:01:16,074 --> 00:01:18,855
You know, making a name for yourself takes time.

33
00:01:19,116 --> 00:01:20,737
Getting good at making games takes time.

34
00:01:20,857 --> 00:01:22,117
I was not very good at making games

35
00:01:22,137 --> 00:01:23,258
when I started 15 years ago.

36
00:01:23,658 --> 00:01:25,460
I still, you know, I'm learning every day, right?

37
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,381
So expect failure along the way.

38
00:01:27,401 --> 00:01:29,662
Failure should be your primary operating mode.

39
00:01:29,742 --> 00:01:30,203
Don't give up.

40
00:01:30,663 --> 00:01:32,925
I mean, I have so many people I read about on Reddit game dev

41
00:01:32,945 --> 00:01:35,508
or something like, oh, we shipped our first game,

42
00:01:35,548 --> 00:01:36,870
and we're going back to work now.

43
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:37,330
It's over.

44
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:38,992
India apocalypse, whatever.

45
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:42,095
Don't give up after your first failure.

46
00:01:42,115 --> 00:01:44,058
If you're giving up after your second failure

47
00:01:44,118 --> 00:01:45,759
or your third failure, you're doing it wrong, right?

48
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,181
What about your 13th failure?

49
00:01:48,262 --> 00:01:49,662
And even after you have success, even

50
00:01:49,682 --> 00:01:51,463
after you have several successful games in a row

51
00:01:51,503 --> 00:01:54,704
financially, failure can still come around and bite you.

52
00:01:54,724 --> 00:01:56,844
Like game number 18 for me actually lost money.

53
00:01:57,764 --> 00:01:59,345
So that's the end of the prologue for any

54
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:00,665
of those of you in the room who might

55
00:02:00,685 --> 00:02:01,505
get the wrong impression.

56
00:02:01,946 --> 00:02:04,906
Now let's get busy talking about this whole indie apocalypse

57
00:02:04,926 --> 00:02:05,106
thing.

58
00:02:05,887 --> 00:02:09,008
So in the apocalypse, where did this idea come from?

59
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:10,789
How did it gain cultural currency?

60
00:02:11,269 --> 00:02:15,751
I think, in my opinion, it came from a string of very publicly

61
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:19,673
announced, very high profile failures from well-known game

62
00:02:19,693 --> 00:02:22,214
developers who had, some of them had track records making

63
00:02:22,254 --> 00:02:23,454
successful games in the past.

64
00:02:24,075 --> 00:02:27,316
And they openly, publicly, several weeks or months

65
00:02:27,436 --> 00:02:28,316
after their games came out.

66
00:02:29,037 --> 00:02:31,638
either wrote post-modem articles or post-modem interviews

67
00:02:31,678 --> 00:02:32,738
where they kind of talked about

68
00:02:33,138 --> 00:02:34,639
their underperformance or failure

69
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:36,140
and everyone kind of talked about it.

70
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,741
It was like sort of the talk of the town at the time.

71
00:02:38,061 --> 00:02:39,301
I'm gonna put some of these games up here,

72
00:02:39,341 --> 00:02:40,982
which I think of sort of being the poster children

73
00:02:41,002 --> 00:02:42,162
of this movement in my mind

74
00:02:42,283 --> 00:02:43,723
as I absorb these stories myself.

75
00:02:44,724 --> 00:02:46,724
I don't mean this as a critique of these games.

76
00:02:46,924 --> 00:02:48,985
I fully respect these games and their designers.

77
00:02:49,305 --> 00:02:50,386
Some of the designers are my friends.

78
00:02:50,406 --> 00:02:51,686
I'm not saying they're bad games at all.

79
00:02:51,806 --> 00:02:53,407
I'm just using them as these public examples

80
00:02:53,427 --> 00:02:55,068
that the designers themselves kind of called out.

81
00:02:55,468 --> 00:02:57,809
So going through the list in order here, in my mind,

82
00:02:58,329 --> 00:03:01,550
starting with Aztez, which is notorious, right?

83
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:02,791
I mean, seven years in development,

84
00:03:03,011 --> 00:03:05,172
and I have a quote from each developer at the top

85
00:03:05,192 --> 00:03:06,332
from one of these post-mortem interviews

86
00:03:06,892 --> 00:03:08,053
about how they sort of felt

87
00:03:08,093 --> 00:03:09,413
about the financial performance of the game.

88
00:03:09,694 --> 00:03:12,395
When I checked most recently on some Steam stats,

89
00:03:12,435 --> 00:03:13,855
there were zero people playing the game.

90
00:03:15,216 --> 00:03:19,380
This game, Scanner Sombra, also kind of popped up on my radar as an indie apocalypse game.

91
00:03:20,181 --> 00:03:22,584
Introversion, huge successful indie developer.

92
00:03:22,624 --> 00:03:23,765
It's been going for a long time.

93
00:03:23,945 --> 00:03:25,426
Prison Architect was a gigantic hit.

94
00:03:25,767 --> 00:03:27,588
The next game, according to them, bombed in a big way.

95
00:03:27,969 --> 00:03:29,931
When I checked, there was only one person playing it in the world.

96
00:03:31,572 --> 00:03:35,738
Where the Water Tastes Like Wine, I remember when this game came out, just inundated with

97
00:03:35,838 --> 00:03:36,559
press coverage, right?

98
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:40,304
Everybody was talking about this game, it's this new narrative game that's coming out.

99
00:03:40,464 --> 00:03:44,129
According to the creator in an interview that I read, it was commercially a disaster.

100
00:03:44,149 --> 00:03:45,872
When I checked, there were four people playing it.

101
00:03:47,334 --> 00:03:49,375
Tacoma, from the creators of Gone Home, Fulbright.

102
00:03:50,596 --> 00:03:53,819
Gone Home was this kind of high watermark in success

103
00:03:53,899 --> 00:03:55,921
in the realm of indie narrative games.

104
00:03:56,362 --> 00:03:58,083
Tacoma maybe wasn't as big of a failure

105
00:03:58,103 --> 00:03:59,324
as some of the other ones I put up on the screen,

106
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,526
but definitely didn't perform anywhere near

107
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,027
to what Gone Home did financially.

108
00:04:03,268 --> 00:04:04,329
When I checked online recently,

109
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:05,750
there were 11 concurrent players.

110
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:08,012
So over the three and a half years,

111
00:04:08,552 --> 00:04:11,175
as I was developing my new game, One Hour One Life,

112
00:04:11,215 --> 00:04:13,457
which was the biggest, craziest project I've ever developed,

113
00:04:15,194 --> 00:04:16,514
I was like hearing these stories, right?

114
00:04:16,735 --> 00:04:19,075
One after another, like another developer

115
00:04:19,115 --> 00:04:20,456
that has way bigger budget than me,

116
00:04:20,836 --> 00:04:22,476
way bigger PR presence than me,

117
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:25,317
maybe a way better game than what I'm making,

118
00:04:26,117 --> 00:04:28,138
is failing financially in this market.

119
00:04:28,198 --> 00:04:30,579
I'm like, geez, is this, like my career's over

120
00:04:30,619 --> 00:04:31,859
and I don't even know it, I'm gonna come out

121
00:04:31,899 --> 00:04:33,759
three and a half years after this like huge project

122
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,000
and it's just gonna flop on its face.

123
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,960
So I was really, really nervous.

124
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:37,981
And my wife was really nervous.

125
00:04:38,021 --> 00:04:39,541
We were talking about the India apocalypse all the time.

126
00:04:40,601 --> 00:04:42,362
But somehow, maybe against all odds,

127
00:04:43,403 --> 00:04:45,165
One Hour in Life was successful.

128
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:49,893
And you can see, I just did a sample and there were 110 concurrent players,

129
00:04:49,913 --> 00:04:52,737
which is an order of magnitude more than the other games I put up on the screen.

130
00:04:53,298 --> 00:04:56,463
And that phrase, order of magnitude, is going to come up a lot during this talk because...

131
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,090
There's a lot of order of magnitude effects

132
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,611
that I've been able to sort of measure with the data.

133
00:05:02,971 --> 00:05:05,772
So, and it's not just numbers of players, right?

134
00:05:05,792 --> 00:05:08,173
I mean, this game, a game made by a single person

135
00:05:08,633 --> 00:05:09,914
has made a substantial amount of money

136
00:05:09,974 --> 00:05:11,814
over the course of four months since it shipped on Steam.

137
00:05:11,854 --> 00:05:12,374
$685,000 gross.

138
00:05:12,394 --> 00:05:12,735
And gross is like...

139
00:05:15,595 --> 00:05:16,736
not without the fees taken out,

140
00:05:16,776 --> 00:05:18,176
without all the chargebacks taken out

141
00:05:18,216 --> 00:05:19,977
and all the VATs and stuff taken out, right?

142
00:05:19,997 --> 00:05:21,978
That's the number I actually see in my steam control panel.

143
00:05:22,398 --> 00:05:24,418
And it's still making good money to this day, right?

144
00:05:24,438 --> 00:05:26,339
Like close to $2,900 a day

145
00:05:27,299 --> 00:05:29,580
for a single person, that's pretty good, right?

146
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:29,640
So.

147
00:05:32,485 --> 00:05:34,385
And so it's an old game, right?

148
00:05:34,465 --> 00:05:36,986
Four months is pretty old in the world of games, right?

149
00:05:37,847 --> 00:05:39,227
But still making money after all this time.

150
00:05:39,407 --> 00:05:41,108
And that 110 concurrent players,

151
00:05:41,128 --> 00:05:42,768
that's just like an instantaneous sample

152
00:05:42,788 --> 00:05:43,949
that I took on a Monday afternoon.

153
00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:47,650
So you might see this and say, so what, Jason?

154
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:50,211
We didn't say the indie apocalypse affected everybody,

155
00:05:50,431 --> 00:05:53,552
that there weren't gonna be any lucky outliers, right?

156
00:05:53,572 --> 00:05:54,812
There weren't gonna be any success stories

157
00:05:54,832 --> 00:05:56,053
or any games that just happened to take off

158
00:05:56,073 --> 00:05:56,893
for this or that reason.

159
00:05:58,393 --> 00:05:59,314
And I thought that at first, too.

160
00:05:59,334 --> 00:05:59,714
I was like, shh.

161
00:06:00,514 --> 00:06:02,736
I guess I dodged a bullet, and the apocalypse didn't happen to me.

162
00:06:02,756 --> 00:06:07,739
I guess I'm just lucky, wow, you know, or maybe my game's just really that good, I don't

163
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:08,260
know what, right?

164
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,202
But then a few months ago, I was looking through Steam Charts.

165
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:16,305
Steam Charts is this website that orders games based on how...

166
00:06:17,746 --> 00:06:19,167
how many concurrent players they have, right?

167
00:06:19,188 --> 00:06:21,790
So you can see the full chart of actually up to the minute

168
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:22,670
kind of concurrent players.

169
00:06:23,191 --> 00:06:25,232
And I was looking down around the area

170
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:26,674
where One Hour One Life was on the chart.

171
00:06:26,714 --> 00:06:29,636
What other games have about 100 or so concurrent players?

172
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:31,818
And I was kind of surprised by what

173
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:33,839
I was seeing down there on that spot of the chart,

174
00:06:33,859 --> 00:06:34,780
because I've seen games.

175
00:06:35,101 --> 00:06:36,682
There were a lot of indie games down there

176
00:06:36,702 --> 00:06:38,844
that were at least as successful, if not more

177
00:06:38,884 --> 00:06:39,964
successful than One Hour One Life.

178
00:06:40,505 --> 00:06:41,906
Games, of course, that we're all talking about,

179
00:06:41,946 --> 00:06:42,787
like huge indie hits.

180
00:06:43,347 --> 00:06:44,288
Like Staxel, right?

181
00:06:44,328 --> 00:06:46,349
We're all talking about this, 115 concurrent players

182
00:06:46,409 --> 00:06:49,832
are dead in Vinland, 116 concurrent players.

183
00:06:49,852 --> 00:06:50,692
This game's even bigger.

184
00:06:51,353 --> 00:06:53,835
Airport CEO, everyone here at GDC

185
00:06:53,855 --> 00:06:54,995
is talking about Airport CEO.

186
00:06:55,396 --> 00:06:58,138
And we're also, Bizly, and this game is twice as successful

187
00:06:58,178 --> 00:06:58,718
as One Hour in Life.

188
00:06:58,738 --> 00:06:59,719
This is a huge game.

189
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,020
I've heard everybody in the hallways

190
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,080
talking about Feed and Grow Fish.

191
00:07:03,862 --> 00:07:08,125
227 concurrent players twice as and these are not cheap games. These are 15 to 20 dollar games

192
00:07:08,726 --> 00:07:13,109
Right and this was just the beginning right because as I went up to the charts, I was like wow, you know

193
00:07:13,149 --> 00:07:17,013
Here's 25 games with more than 130 concurrent players. And yes, there's some well-known games on this list

194
00:07:17,093 --> 00:07:22,017
But there's also a lot that you don't know. Here's 50 more games with more than 137 concurrent players huge hits

195
00:07:22,037 --> 00:07:23,758
We're all talking about like adventure communist

196
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,300
YouTubers, LifeOMG, Sheltered Stasis,

197
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,341
maybe I've heard of that, I don't know,

198
00:07:29,381 --> 00:07:31,502
Colony Survival, Liftoff,

199
00:07:31,962 --> 00:07:32,963
actually that's a drone simulator,

200
00:07:32,983 --> 00:07:33,583
I have played that game.

201
00:07:35,102 --> 00:07:37,304
Here's 100 more games, 150 concurrent players each.

202
00:07:37,564 --> 00:07:40,286
Here's 200 more games with 185 concurrent players each.

203
00:07:40,747 --> 00:07:42,829
I've put up, these all have more players

204
00:07:42,849 --> 00:07:43,489
than One Hour One Life.

205
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:46,672
I've put up 375 games so far on the screen in these grids,

206
00:07:46,712 --> 00:07:47,994
but it's just a small fraction

207
00:07:48,014 --> 00:07:50,736
because there's actually more than 1,000 games on Steam

208
00:07:50,836 --> 00:07:53,018
at this very moment with more concurrent players

209
00:07:53,058 --> 00:07:53,839
than One Hour One Life.

210
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:54,520
So.

211
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:00,603
And there's actually more than 300 games with more than a thousand concurrent players each, right?

212
00:08:00,944 --> 00:08:04,666
So there's tons and tons and tons of huge success stories here,

213
00:08:05,086 --> 00:08:08,348
like life-changing financial results for lots of game developers,

214
00:08:09,048 --> 00:08:10,509
but we're just not hearing about them, right?

215
00:08:10,749 --> 00:08:12,190
Like maybe there's more success on Steam,

216
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:15,252
maybe more people making more money on games on Steam than ever before,

217
00:08:15,712 --> 00:08:18,274
and we just kind of are kind of ignoring it for some reason.

218
00:08:19,274 --> 00:08:21,636
Still, all that said, even if there is more success,

219
00:08:21,716 --> 00:08:22,976
a lot has changed since 2014,

220
00:08:24,257 --> 00:08:25,757
when I launched my last game on Steam,

221
00:08:25,778 --> 00:08:26,738
which was the Castle Doctrine.

222
00:08:27,838 --> 00:08:28,879
I'm gonna go through launch day.

223
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:30,040
What actually happened on launch day

224
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,180
for these two games to compare?

225
00:08:32,701 --> 00:08:34,262
And the biggest thing that everyone always talks about,

226
00:08:34,342 --> 00:08:37,723
sort of the main talking point for the indie apocalypse,

227
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:39,024
is crowding on Steam, right?

228
00:08:39,904 --> 00:08:42,265
And indeed, when the Castle Doctrine came out in 2014,

229
00:08:42,405 --> 00:08:44,827
there were four games released on Steam that day,

230
00:08:45,347 --> 00:08:46,527
including the Castle Doctrine.

231
00:08:47,388 --> 00:08:49,870
Whereas when One Hour of Life came out in 2018,

232
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:52,713
just four months ago, there were 42 games released that day.

233
00:08:53,614 --> 00:08:55,996
So an order of magnitude, I talked about order of magnitude before,

234
00:08:56,116 --> 00:08:58,238
order of magnitude more games released the day,

235
00:08:58,318 --> 00:09:00,180
order of magnitude more crowding.

236
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,921
And of course this meant, like,

237
00:09:02,362 --> 00:09:04,484
the Castle Doctrine was on that front page of Steam,

238
00:09:04,684 --> 00:09:06,746
on the new release list, for like almost an entire week

239
00:09:06,806 --> 00:09:07,947
before it fell off the bottom of the list.

240
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,288
One Hour in Life was never on any new release list

241
00:09:12,308 --> 00:09:15,973
because there's just not room for 42 games on that list.

242
00:09:16,633 --> 00:09:19,196
OK, but in this huge crowd, maybe press coverage

243
00:09:19,216 --> 00:09:19,857
can help you.

244
00:09:20,438 --> 00:09:22,240
One Hour in Life is kind of a noteworthy game.

245
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,781
Maybe press wants to talk about it.

246
00:09:23,861 --> 00:09:24,682
It was like pulling teeth.

247
00:09:25,303 --> 00:09:26,804
to get the press to cover One Hour in Life.

248
00:09:27,944 --> 00:09:30,045
12 different websites wrote reviews

249
00:09:30,285 --> 00:09:32,466
with scores of the Castle Doctrine over time.

250
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:36,048
During launch, I had just gazillions of articles

251
00:09:36,088 --> 00:09:36,728
being written about it.

252
00:09:37,189 --> 00:09:39,730
I couldn't get almost anybody to write about One Hour in Life.

253
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:40,930
And in the entire history of the game,

254
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:43,592
it's been out for a year, including the time before Steam,

255
00:09:43,612 --> 00:09:45,313
there's only been two review articles written.

256
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:46,413
Like, nobody's covering this game.

257
00:09:47,294 --> 00:09:50,375
And those two results, those two factors conspired

258
00:09:50,395 --> 00:09:52,656
to give us really dismal results on day one, right?

259
00:09:52,696 --> 00:09:53,176
315 units?

260
00:09:55,229 --> 00:09:59,673
Order of magnitude again, more units for the Cal State, I found 2,400 units on day one alone.

261
00:09:59,713 --> 00:10:03,558
$5,000 after three and a half years of work.

262
00:10:06,185 --> 00:10:08,306
So we've all seen this curve before, right?

263
00:10:08,506 --> 00:10:11,287
This is like a normal first month sales curve.

264
00:10:11,307 --> 00:10:13,088
This is the first month of the Castle Doctrine sales in 2014.

265
00:10:13,408 --> 00:10:16,389
And I've seen this curve before for my other games.

266
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,750
It's sort of the expected curve for game sales.

267
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:21,552
That's the launch day peak with the slow exponential decay

268
00:10:21,592 --> 00:10:22,672
going off into infinity.

269
00:10:23,433 --> 00:10:25,093
Now the scary thing for us, and when I say us,

270
00:10:25,153 --> 00:10:28,075
I mean me and my wife who was also paying attention

271
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:29,175
to these results as they came in

272
00:10:29,215 --> 00:10:30,616
after three and a half years of work,

273
00:10:31,736 --> 00:10:33,357
was that our launch day peak for one hour

274
00:10:33,777 --> 00:10:34,738
looked like this.

275
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:39,220
Now, if, and we know because we've shipped other games,

276
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,701
over the years we've seen other games,

277
00:10:40,721 --> 00:10:41,481
we've seen these results,

278
00:10:41,801 --> 00:10:44,443
like launch day is always your biggest day, right?

279
00:10:44,883 --> 00:10:46,023
It only goes down from there.

280
00:10:46,364 --> 00:10:47,984
So if we apply that same exponential decay,

281
00:10:48,024 --> 00:10:49,765
like using the Castle of Actions data as a model,

282
00:10:50,846 --> 00:10:52,707
like our sales curve is gonna look like this.

283
00:10:52,807 --> 00:10:55,828
And it's like, oh my God, we're doomed.

284
00:10:56,228 --> 00:10:57,049
Like we were looking at this number,

285
00:10:57,069 --> 00:10:58,329
like we are just doomed.

286
00:10:58,349 --> 00:11:00,190
The India apocalypse is real.

287
00:11:01,972 --> 00:11:06,816
But we were shocked and pleasantly shocked when day two was bigger than day one.

288
00:11:07,256 --> 00:11:12,340
Like what? And day three was bigger than day two and the slope was increasing, right?

289
00:11:12,801 --> 00:11:18,565
Like what? Like how is this happening? And it wasn't until day five, a full four days

290
00:11:18,605 --> 00:11:21,247
after our launch, that we hit our peak. And the peak was a little bit higher than

291
00:11:21,287 --> 00:11:23,029
the Castle Doctrine. So at that point we were like, okay.

292
00:11:23,948 --> 00:11:26,609
Well, this game is much bigger, took much longer to develop than the Castle Doctrine.

293
00:11:26,629 --> 00:11:28,771
I guess it's going to make a tiny bit more money than the Castle Doctrine.

294
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:31,472
Maybe that same exponential decay curve is going to kick in, and it's going to look like,

295
00:11:31,492 --> 00:11:33,673
well, you know, at least we'll have made a little bit more than the Castle Doctrine.

296
00:11:34,334 --> 00:11:37,916
But the actual curve looked substantially different, the shape of this curve.

297
00:11:38,036 --> 00:11:40,337
And it's sort of the first impetus for this talk,

298
00:11:40,417 --> 00:11:42,378
is the actual curve for the rest of the month looked like this.

299
00:11:43,099 --> 00:11:45,700
which is still going down, just not as precipitously, right?

300
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,221
And it's kind of like smeared out in this way, right?

301
00:11:49,562 --> 00:11:50,982
And we need to account for this somehow.

302
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:52,743
And I think the best way to start accounting for it

303
00:11:52,763 --> 00:11:54,544
is to talk about launch week alone, right?

304
00:11:54,684 --> 00:11:56,825
Even that section of the curve is so different in shape

305
00:11:57,285 --> 00:11:58,466
that we need to be able to account for it.

306
00:11:58,506 --> 00:12:00,027
So what was going on during launch week?

307
00:12:00,047 --> 00:12:00,987
We talked about launch day.

308
00:12:01,547 --> 00:12:02,288
What other factors?

309
00:12:02,368 --> 00:12:04,729
So let's think about YouTube videos, right?

310
00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:07,110
Who was making YouTube videos at the CalSol document?

311
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:08,791
During launch week, there were only three videos made.

312
00:12:09,631 --> 00:12:12,972
There were 31 YouTube videos made about one hour in life during launch week alone.

313
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:15,633
What about viewership? So that's order of magnitude again, right?

314
00:12:16,093 --> 00:12:23,356
Viewership, 24,000 views on those three videos versus 684,000 views on the one hour in life videos, right?

315
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:29,498
So, nobody was making videos about the Castle of Doctrine and almost nobody was watching them.

316
00:12:30,739 --> 00:12:33,520
We can also look at an overall comparison, just long-term, not just launch week.

317
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:36,201
Like, what about the top YouTube video ever made about either of these games?

318
00:12:37,486 --> 00:12:40,028
Top video ever made in the history of the Castle Doctrine

319
00:12:40,048 --> 00:12:42,890
is 282,000 views versus 2.2 million views

320
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:45,052
on the top few video that's been viewed

321
00:12:45,412 --> 00:12:46,193
for one hour in life.

322
00:12:46,793 --> 00:12:48,494
So again, order of magnitude difference, right?

323
00:12:49,315 --> 00:12:50,336
Okay, so what does this mean?

324
00:12:50,676 --> 00:12:51,737
This curve that I put up before,

325
00:12:51,757 --> 00:12:53,418
which is the Castle Doctrine sales curve,

326
00:12:53,798 --> 00:12:56,460
this is a press curve, this is a hype curve,

327
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,861
this is an all your eggs in one basket,

328
00:12:57,982 --> 00:12:58,982
all firing on all cylinders.

329
00:13:00,584 --> 00:13:02,385
get all your ducks in a row on that launch day,

330
00:13:02,765 --> 00:13:04,566
get all your press embargoes lined up, right,

331
00:13:04,586 --> 00:13:06,428
and they're all going to write those articles on that one day

332
00:13:06,468 --> 00:13:07,508
and that's going to be your big coverage

333
00:13:07,528 --> 00:13:08,509
and everyone's going to find out about the game

334
00:13:08,549 --> 00:13:10,510
and they're all going to buy it.

335
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:12,572
And, well, then the number of people finding out about your game

336
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:13,673
is just going to decline over time

337
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:15,474
because those articles fall off their front pages

338
00:13:15,534 --> 00:13:17,955
and people aren't writing launch articles about your game

339
00:13:17,995 --> 00:13:19,096
like a week and a half later, right?

340
00:13:20,668 --> 00:13:24,649
So this one little problem though in the four years that have transpired,

341
00:13:26,229 --> 00:13:32,271
the press kind of died along the way, right? And you know you might say well no, by dead I mean

342
00:13:32,331 --> 00:13:38,052
not that it doesn't exist, but that its influence in terms of game sales has dried up substantially.

343
00:13:38,092 --> 00:13:40,932
And the articles that were written about One Hour in Life seem to have almost no effect.

344
00:13:41,233 --> 00:13:44,293
You go look at the comment rolls, remember the old days like four or five years ago when

345
00:13:44,813 --> 00:13:47,874
some article on Rock Paper Shotgun or Kotaku would have like 100 comments?

346
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:50,495
Like now they have like three or four comments, right?

347
00:13:50,915 --> 00:13:53,880
So I don't know if people aren't reading it or people aren't responding to it in the same way

348
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,864
But it just isn't having the effect that it used to and it's evidence of this

349
00:13:56,904 --> 00:14:03,734
Let's look at some of these indie apocalypse games, right? There were 45 review articles on 45 different websites written about this game, right?

350
00:14:04,996 --> 00:14:05,497
Tacoma even

351
00:14:05,557 --> 00:14:10,920
more, right? 56! Like, how do you... are there even 56 websites that could write... I mean, yeah, it's a lot.

352
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:15,523
They must have had, like, a huge PR budget, which I didn't have, right? I did my best, emailed my

353
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:18,644
contacts. My contacts ignored me, even though they've been covering my games for years, right?

354
00:14:19,105 --> 00:14:22,927
And, um, but contrast, of course, I said there were only two of the articles written, but it didn't seem

355
00:14:22,947 --> 00:14:27,129
to matter. Now, this next game I'm going to show, which is, like, twice as successful or more than

356
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:28,931
any of these games, maybe all these games combined...

357
00:14:29,731 --> 00:14:31,773
There were no review articles written about Feed & Grow Fish.

358
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,955
No one's covered this damn thing, yet it's successful.

359
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,258
So clearly that press either,

360
00:14:36,778 --> 00:14:37,960
there's lots of press for those other games,

361
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,561
either people didn't read it or they read it

362
00:14:39,621 --> 00:14:41,764
and those types of people don't buy games, I don't know.

363
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:46,648
That normal height curve that I showed before,

364
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:47,849
if you go on into the second month,

365
00:14:47,889 --> 00:14:49,510
I said it kind of goes into this long, thin tail

366
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,311
off into infinity, and that's exactly what happened

367
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:52,772
for the Castle Doctrine.

368
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:55,494
Now, One Hour One Life actually started up higher

369
00:14:55,534 --> 00:14:56,615
at the beginning of the second month.

370
00:14:57,356 --> 00:14:59,197
So it's like, okay, well, we'll have a thicker tail

371
00:14:59,237 --> 00:15:00,198
for a little bit longer.

372
00:15:00,258 --> 00:15:02,099
Maybe we'll expect the tail to kind of look like this,

373
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:02,900
starting at that point,

374
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,621
and applying the Castle Doctrine's data as a model.

375
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:05,482
Now,

376
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,761
What actually happened during month two for One Hour of Life

377
00:15:10,742 --> 00:15:11,842
is nothing short of shocking,

378
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,504
and is the real shape difference

379
00:15:14,544 --> 00:15:15,324
that I'm talking about here,

380
00:15:15,644 --> 00:15:17,946
and the sort of impetus, the primary thesis of this talk.

381
00:15:18,426 --> 00:15:22,248
So, month two of One Hour of Life looked like this, right?

382
00:15:22,648 --> 00:15:24,449
Going slowly up over time, right?

383
00:15:24,489 --> 00:15:26,550
To the point where at the end of the month, it was...

384
00:15:27,733 --> 00:15:29,894
more than twice what it was at the beginning of the month.

385
00:15:29,934 --> 00:15:31,895
Like, how does that happen?

386
00:15:31,915 --> 00:15:34,675
That's not an exponential slow decay long tail kind of thing.

387
00:15:35,056 --> 00:15:37,396
Press at lunchtime, even if people read it,

388
00:15:37,516 --> 00:15:39,137
even if people react to it in buying your game,

389
00:15:39,497 --> 00:15:40,377
can't do this.

390
00:15:40,597 --> 00:15:42,898
Because there's no big articles being written slowly

391
00:15:42,938 --> 00:15:44,458
over time over the course of the second month.

392
00:15:45,258 --> 00:15:47,539
This curve is a sign of word of mouth.

393
00:15:47,819 --> 00:15:51,440
Right? And YouTube videos are one type of word of mouth.

394
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,380
And I talked about them before.

395
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,221
They're very sort of modern, distributed,

396
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:55,301
Internet kind of word of mouth.

397
00:15:55,661 --> 00:15:57,381
Twitch streaming, another type of word of mouth.

398
00:15:57,781 --> 00:15:59,022
So let's look at some YouTube stats

399
00:15:59,082 --> 00:16:00,662
for those indie apocalypse games.

400
00:16:01,202 --> 00:16:03,123
Like the number one video that's ever been made in terms

401
00:16:03,183 --> 00:16:04,803
of viewership for Where the Water Tastes

402
00:16:04,823 --> 00:16:05,963
in Wine has 96,000 views.

403
00:16:06,363 --> 00:16:09,004
For Tacoma, it's a little bit higher, 133,000 views.

404
00:16:09,184 --> 00:16:09,704
But look at that.

405
00:16:09,784 --> 00:16:11,024
It's a six-minute long video.

406
00:16:11,324 --> 00:16:12,925
If you look at that video, what it is is like a,

407
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,665
literally is called Watch This Before You Buy Tacoma.

408
00:16:16,026 --> 00:16:17,546
So it's like a little review video, right?

409
00:16:19,287 --> 00:16:20,788
But look at the top video for One Hour One Life.

410
00:16:20,968 --> 00:16:23,370
Like I said, 2.2 million views, quite a bit more views,

411
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:25,232
but 24 minutes long, right?

412
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:28,594
What happened to the three minute YouTube video rule, right?

413
00:16:28,774 --> 00:16:29,355
24 minutes of what?

414
00:16:29,995 --> 00:16:33,318
It is literally just a guy playing the game for 24 minutes

415
00:16:33,418 --> 00:16:35,379
and talking about his experience and reacting to it, right?

416
00:16:35,439 --> 00:16:36,580
His own, it's a Let's Play, right?

417
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,021
His own unique experience for 24 minutes.

418
00:16:38,962 --> 00:16:41,383
And when we look at this even more popular game,

419
00:16:41,603 --> 00:16:43,664
it also has a seven million view video,

420
00:16:43,684 --> 00:16:45,585
which is a 10 minute long video of just somebody

421
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,305
sitting there playing the game and talking about it.

422
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:49,906
Just what it's like to have a unique experience

423
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:50,567
inside this game.

424
00:16:51,867 --> 00:16:54,528
So word of mouth curve, what other kinds of word of mouth

425
00:16:54,548 --> 00:16:55,369
can we talk about here?

426
00:16:55,549 --> 00:16:57,370
Well, there's an elephant in the living room here,

427
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:58,450
which is that giant spike.

428
00:16:59,391 --> 00:16:59,871
What is that?

429
00:16:59,991 --> 00:17:01,992
Is that like, oh, PewDiePie played the game that day?

430
00:17:02,052 --> 00:17:03,612
No, PewDiePie still hasn't played one hour in life.

431
00:17:04,213 --> 00:17:04,753
Maybe someday.

432
00:17:05,553 --> 00:17:06,754
Was it some Twitch streamer?

433
00:17:06,814 --> 00:17:08,275
No, actually, that's just Christmas Day.

434
00:17:09,475 --> 00:17:12,397
Now people don't buy games on Christmas Day, right?

435
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:13,678
Well, I guess they do.

436
00:17:14,498 --> 00:17:16,179
And Christmas Day you can sort of think about

437
00:17:16,259 --> 00:17:17,700
as the ultimate word of mouth day, right?

438
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,941
You're hanging out with your friends and family,

439
00:17:18,961 --> 00:17:20,822
your cousins, other people in your family are playing games.

440
00:17:21,162 --> 00:17:22,483
You're all talking about what you've been hearing about

441
00:17:22,503 --> 00:17:23,424
for the past couple of months.

442
00:17:23,724 --> 00:17:25,065
You all just got Steam gift cards

443
00:17:25,205 --> 00:17:26,806
in your Christmas stockings, right?

444
00:17:26,826 --> 00:17:27,786
And it's burning a hole in your,

445
00:17:27,806 --> 00:17:29,187
and you're all like, oh, what game should I buy?

446
00:17:29,227 --> 00:17:30,068
I'm good saving up, whatever.

447
00:17:31,549 --> 00:17:36,171
Now this was a full month and a half after the launch of my game, and that kind of word of mouth

448
00:17:36,671 --> 00:17:40,433
can only work if people are still playing and talking about your game a month and a half after

449
00:17:40,473 --> 00:17:45,316
launch, right? Now that got me thinking about how long people are playing each of these games,

450
00:17:45,376 --> 00:17:49,598
right? Like not in terms of hours, but in terms of like lifespan or something, but let's just

451
00:17:49,638 --> 00:17:50,698
first talk about hours, right?

452
00:17:52,059 --> 00:17:54,641
So the way I, there's no actual hard stats about this,

453
00:17:54,681 --> 00:17:56,263
so I came up with this kind of unbiased way

454
00:17:56,303 --> 00:17:59,025
of taking a script, taking the front page of Steam

455
00:17:59,065 --> 00:18:01,067
with the reviews that happen to show up on the front page,

456
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:05,050
which are past 30 days, most helpful reviews,

457
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,812
and most recent reviews, and screen scraping that,

458
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:09,494
which has a number of hours played

459
00:18:09,514 --> 00:18:11,596
for each of those reviewers, and averaging it, right?

460
00:18:12,136 --> 00:18:13,257
So for Where the Water Tastes Like Wine,

461
00:18:13,277 --> 00:18:14,718
the average front page Steam reviewer

462
00:18:14,778 --> 00:18:17,000
had played the game for 10 hours on average.

463
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,461
For Tacoma, it was 4.3 hours, right?

464
00:18:19,602 --> 00:18:21,164
So these are relatively short games.

465
00:18:21,985 --> 00:18:23,386
For One Hour in Life, the average reviewer

466
00:18:23,426 --> 00:18:27,229
had played for 44 hours, which is a lot, right?

467
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:28,290
It's a longer game.

468
00:18:29,471 --> 00:18:32,414
And this Feed and Grow Fish game as well, 28 hours, right?

469
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:34,156
So these are longer games.

470
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:36,138
Now, some people with One Hour in Life

471
00:18:36,178 --> 00:18:36,918
may have gone overboard.

472
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:38,400
Like, the top player in the whole history of the game

473
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:41,623
has played for 1,800 hours, which is like, jeez, what am I?

474
00:18:43,396 --> 00:18:46,138
Keep my kids away from this game, please.

475
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:50,121
But I don't think total number of hours logged is as important

476
00:18:50,141 --> 00:18:51,702
as play span.

477
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,925
How long is this game part of your life in some form

478
00:18:54,965 --> 00:18:55,325
or another?

479
00:18:55,706 --> 00:18:57,687
We don't have play span stats for the other games,

480
00:18:57,927 --> 00:18:58,928
because that's just not available.

481
00:18:59,288 --> 00:19:00,970
But if you think about a four-hour game,

482
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:03,111
if people are playing Tacoma on average four hours

483
00:19:03,211 --> 00:19:06,294
before they write a review, you can't play a four-hour game

484
00:19:06,334 --> 00:19:08,035
over the course of a month and a half or two months

485
00:19:08,075 --> 00:19:08,656
or something like that.

486
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:12,377
People do play one hour in life over an extended period of time.

487
00:19:12,437 --> 00:19:15,379
So taking all, I have actual detailed stats about every game,

488
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:17,660
every life in the game that anyone's ever lived, right?

489
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:21,302
And so if I look at the players who have played at least one hour of the game,

490
00:19:21,962 --> 00:19:25,504
from the time they started playing to when they finally quit and stopped playing for good,

491
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:28,205
was on average for the entire population of players 48 days.

492
00:19:29,675 --> 00:19:31,576
So that's more than a month and a half, right?

493
00:19:32,257 --> 00:19:34,218
And some players have been playing the entire year

494
00:19:34,258 --> 00:19:35,779
that it's been out, not every day,

495
00:19:35,819 --> 00:19:38,580
but on and off over the course of 12 months.

496
00:19:40,081 --> 00:19:41,581
And a good portion of players have been playing it

497
00:19:41,702 --> 00:19:42,522
for more than four months.

498
00:19:42,942 --> 00:19:44,963
So their play span from when they first started

499
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:46,704
to when they quit for 10% of the players

500
00:19:46,784 --> 00:19:47,865
is four months or longer.

501
00:19:48,765 --> 00:19:49,926
So I think that what has happened here

502
00:19:50,006 --> 00:19:52,607
is actually that the kinds of games that people

503
00:19:54,248 --> 00:19:56,408
play and want to spend money on,

504
00:19:56,548 --> 00:19:58,069
and the kinds of games they value may have changed.

505
00:19:58,089 --> 00:20:00,189
Like the old kind of indie success model

506
00:20:00,209 --> 00:20:02,250
was these short one-time experience games

507
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,770
that you just got to play, you got to try.

508
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,811
New model is these sort of long-term hobby community

509
00:20:06,891 --> 00:20:08,031
kind of lifestyle games maybe.

510
00:20:08,611 --> 00:20:10,151
And that maybe the way players think

511
00:20:10,171 --> 00:20:11,232
about these games has changed, right?

512
00:20:11,272 --> 00:20:12,192
Like we used to say like,

513
00:20:12,432 --> 00:20:13,712
hey, have you played that game Fez?

514
00:20:13,732 --> 00:20:14,793
Or have you played that game Braid?

515
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:16,173
If any of you people in this room

516
00:20:16,213 --> 00:20:17,093
actually remember those games.

517
00:20:17,653 --> 00:20:20,274
And now we might say, do you play, right?

518
00:20:20,294 --> 00:20:22,034
Like, hey, do you play League of Legends?

519
00:20:22,694 --> 00:20:23,795
Are you a one-hour of life player?

520
00:20:24,395 --> 00:20:28,337
And it's a little weird to think about this being a new way to talk about games, right?

521
00:20:28,357 --> 00:20:32,018
Because given the long history of games, that's always the way we've thought about games.

522
00:20:32,038 --> 00:20:32,778
Like, do you play chess?

523
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:35,179
You don't say, hey, you ever play that game chess ever?

524
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:41,942
So I think it's a new way of thinking about video games, in particular because of the

525
00:20:41,982 --> 00:20:42,783
Internet primarily.

526
00:20:42,823 --> 00:20:46,544
So I think the advice that designers give each other needs to change as well, right?

527
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:48,726
We used to need to make the games,

528
00:20:49,066 --> 00:20:50,647
the kinds of games that we wanted to play.

529
00:20:51,268 --> 00:20:54,130
Now we need to make the kinds of games we actually do play.

530
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:57,833
Right, like our own personal play histories don't lie here.

531
00:20:57,853 --> 00:20:59,815
Right, like what are we actually spending our time playing?

532
00:21:01,056 --> 00:21:02,757
Look at Steam, look at these stats.

533
00:21:02,797 --> 00:21:04,619
Like Steam is not gonna trick you here, right?

534
00:21:04,879 --> 00:21:06,820
And I was actually surprised when preparing this talk

535
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:07,781
and I went to look at my stats,

536
00:21:07,801 --> 00:21:08,802
I was gonna talk about this game,

537
00:21:09,262 --> 00:21:10,243
What Remains of Edith Finch.

538
00:21:10,944 --> 00:21:12,504
And I remember playing it for one afternoon.

539
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,925
Steam tells me I only played it for two hours.

540
00:21:14,985 --> 00:21:15,966
I definitely finished the game.

541
00:21:16,006 --> 00:21:17,026
I remember playing it in one day

542
00:21:17,066 --> 00:21:17,867
and having a really interesting,

543
00:21:17,887 --> 00:21:19,067
I really liked this game a lot.

544
00:21:19,107 --> 00:21:20,508
It was really interesting in a lot of ways.

545
00:21:20,568 --> 00:21:22,569
It did a bunch of things I've never seen anybody do before

546
00:21:22,869 --> 00:21:25,150
with a narrative game and with interactive systems

547
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:25,570
and so on.

548
00:21:27,231 --> 00:21:32,095
But it really was just two hours of my life, I guess.

549
00:21:33,295 --> 00:21:35,817
And it was a critical darling.

550
00:21:35,937 --> 00:21:37,799
It won all sorts of Game of the Year awards

551
00:21:37,819 --> 00:21:38,759
in all sorts of venues.

552
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:40,000
It won a BAFTA.

553
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,121
What game wins a BAFTA?

554
00:21:41,141 --> 00:21:42,502
There's a little golden face there.

555
00:21:43,543 --> 00:21:45,384
But despite all that, when I looked at the stats,

556
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:46,705
there were only 33 people in the world

557
00:21:46,745 --> 00:21:49,467
playing this kind of monster hit critical darling game.

558
00:21:50,507 --> 00:21:54,009
And it really didn't, because I only played it for one afternoon, did not integrate into my life

559
00:21:54,609 --> 00:21:59,332
the way a game like Rust did, right? Which I played for 336 hours over the course of two years.

560
00:21:59,372 --> 00:22:02,053
Now, I didn't play every day for two years or whatever. Those hours are way spread out.

561
00:22:03,034 --> 00:22:07,956
But Rust is an older game than Edith Finch, and there's like 40,000 people playing it at this very moment, right?

562
00:22:09,517 --> 00:22:12,459
So people kept hearing me talk about this game.

563
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:15,481
With Edith Finch, I've talked to several people about it

564
00:22:15,521 --> 00:22:16,902
over time, every time I remember it,

565
00:22:16,942 --> 00:22:18,162
but I'm not constantly thinking about it

566
00:22:18,183 --> 00:22:19,764
because I'm not constantly still playing it.

567
00:22:20,244 --> 00:22:22,165
I've never, as far as I'm aware, convinced anybody

568
00:22:22,205 --> 00:22:24,307
to buy the game that I've talked to.

569
00:22:24,687 --> 00:22:26,788
But I know of at least eight people

570
00:22:26,828 --> 00:22:29,770
that I can name who bought Rust specifically because I

571
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:30,591
kept talking about it.

572
00:22:31,271 --> 00:22:32,672
And some of them wanted to play with me or whatever,

573
00:22:32,712 --> 00:22:34,132
but just like, even there's probably

574
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:35,793
some people in this room who bought Rust

575
00:22:35,853 --> 00:22:36,893
because they heard me talk about it,

576
00:22:37,873 --> 00:22:39,554
because I kept talking about it over time.

577
00:22:40,634 --> 00:22:42,755
So my summary of this difference between these two

578
00:22:42,795 --> 00:22:44,115
types of games, one which I think

579
00:22:44,135 --> 00:22:46,776
has become extremely risky in the modern ecosystem,

580
00:22:46,796 --> 00:22:48,937
it's still possible to have success with this type of game,

581
00:22:49,257 --> 00:22:52,078
but much more risky, is the consumable game.

582
00:22:52,978 --> 00:22:54,939
And far less risky are what I'm calling

583
00:22:55,099 --> 00:22:56,980
infinite unique situation generators.

584
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:03,205
Which, you know, I think about it, you know, I was intentionally making One Hour in Life that way three and a half years ago.

585
00:23:04,346 --> 00:23:08,831
But, you know, if we look at all of the gigantic indie hits that have come along,

586
00:23:08,931 --> 00:23:12,594
I'm not talking about just the minor hits or like the games that will make quite good money,

587
00:23:12,654 --> 00:23:15,797
but the games that are making an astronomical amount of money, like these games,

588
00:23:16,058 --> 00:23:19,281
I mean, if you actually do the numbers here, these games are making insane amounts of money.

589
00:23:19,781 --> 00:23:22,363
And they are all these infinite unique situation generators.

590
00:23:22,803 --> 00:23:24,884
I'm going to talk briefly about one outlier here,

591
00:23:25,124 --> 00:23:27,886
which is maybe the king of consumable content games,

592
00:23:27,946 --> 00:23:28,126
right?

593
00:23:28,726 --> 00:23:33,769
The Witness, which is just a jaw-dropping human

594
00:23:33,809 --> 00:23:36,190
accomplishment in terms of how much stuff and how many ideas

595
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:38,552
and how long and how deep it goes, right?

596
00:23:40,493 --> 00:23:42,594
This game came out smack dab in the middle of the indie

597
00:23:42,634 --> 00:23:43,054
apocalypse.

598
00:23:43,094 --> 00:23:44,535
And it basically said, hey, I don't care.

599
00:23:45,035 --> 00:23:46,476
I'm going to be successful anyway, right?

600
00:23:47,336 --> 00:23:51,119
And its concurrent player curve during the first,

601
00:23:51,339 --> 00:23:53,000
we actually have this data on Steam charts,

602
00:23:53,521 --> 00:23:55,162
concurrent player curve for the first two years

603
00:23:55,202 --> 00:23:56,863
of its existence on Steam looked like this.

604
00:23:56,943 --> 00:23:58,885
And this graph should look a little bit familiar to you,

605
00:23:58,925 --> 00:23:59,925
at least the first half of it,

606
00:24:01,146 --> 00:24:03,148
that kind of launch peak with the exponential decay.

607
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:05,970
Now, of course, there's some extra noise there,

608
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:08,291
a little mini spike there around year one.

609
00:24:08,311 --> 00:24:09,552
I think that's probably when it was on sale,

610
00:24:09,572 --> 00:24:10,873
although I'm not 100% sure about that.

611
00:24:12,546 --> 00:24:16,309
So let's compare it to a unique situation generator, Subnautica.

612
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:20,612
It also came out right in the middle of the Indian apocalypse and apparently didn't care.

613
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:25,356
But its graph over the first two months has a slightly different shape.

614
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:28,238
So this is the Witness's graph over the first two years.

615
00:24:28,278 --> 00:24:29,860
Here's Subnautica's graph.

616
00:24:33,157 --> 00:24:35,598
So you can see that the part of the graph

617
00:24:35,638 --> 00:24:37,158
you can actually see has a very different shape

618
00:24:37,198 --> 00:24:38,939
for that first year, and I gotta zoom out a little bit

619
00:24:38,959 --> 00:24:41,400
to see the rest of it, right?

620
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,201
So that curve, that shape that's sort of slowly growing

621
00:24:45,241 --> 00:24:47,562
over time gradually to this giant kind of explosion

622
00:24:47,582 --> 00:24:49,383
at the end, that's a very different curve

623
00:24:49,423 --> 00:24:52,004
than we used to see four or five years ago, right?

624
00:24:52,644 --> 00:24:55,125
Also, this property of unique situation generators

625
00:24:55,145 --> 00:24:55,665
holds true for

626
00:24:56,525 --> 00:25:00,387
All of these non-indie games, I call them non-indie, maybe League of Legends is technically

627
00:25:00,447 --> 00:25:05,588
indie, but non-indie games that have defined our generation as game culture, right?

628
00:25:06,309 --> 00:25:07,089
Each in their own way.

629
00:25:07,569 --> 00:25:10,930
Maybe most of them are leaning on multiplayer, and multiplayer is definitely one way to achieve

630
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:13,531
unique situation generation, but that's not the only way.

631
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:19,033
And this really fits in with the idea of YouTube videos and Twitch streams and so on being so important in the modern ecosystem

632
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:23,055
because, like, how do you make a video about a consumable game, right?

633
00:25:23,375 --> 00:25:26,236
Anybody who wants to buy the game would avoid watching videos

634
00:25:26,256 --> 00:25:28,077
because they don't want the game spoiled for them.

635
00:25:28,477 --> 00:25:32,538
Even if you find, like, a way to make a video without spoiling it, you're kind of, like,

636
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:36,100
not really making a video that's all that different that other people haven't already shown, right?

637
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:40,922
Whereas, like, these infinite unique situation generators, they're just, like, obvious candidates for lots of videos, right?

638
00:25:41,902 --> 00:25:45,023
Otherwise, how could this one YouTuber,

639
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:48,043
one guy on one channel over the past year,

640
00:25:48,203 --> 00:25:52,124
make 159 videos, just about one hour, one life?

641
00:25:52,924 --> 00:25:53,864
Just about one game.

642
00:25:55,005 --> 00:25:56,785
And every video that he made showed

643
00:25:56,825 --> 00:25:58,825
some different crazy situation happening in the game

644
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:01,026
that not only had he never shown on his channel,

645
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:02,586
but that no one had ever shown before,

646
00:26:02,606 --> 00:26:03,806
because this never happened before.

647
00:26:04,366 --> 00:26:06,647
So it's a total obvious good candidate

648
00:26:06,667 --> 00:26:07,627
for making video after video.

649
00:26:07,647 --> 00:26:09,407
This guy was making multiple videos per week,

650
00:26:09,447 --> 00:26:10,208
about one hour on life.

651
00:26:11,788 --> 00:26:17,573
And so in conclusion, it's no coincidence that those games that I see as sort of the poster

652
00:26:17,593 --> 00:26:22,497
children for the indie apocalypse, these are all consumable games, right? While those no-name hit

653
00:26:22,537 --> 00:26:27,582
games that I pulled off of Steam charts, I didn't pick them on purpose this way, but after I picked

654
00:26:27,602 --> 00:26:31,105
them, I went and looked at each one. I'm like, yeah, actually, these are each in their own way

655
00:26:31,525 --> 00:26:35,729
unique situation generators. Even that Dead in Vinland game, which kind of looks like a story

656
00:26:35,769 --> 00:26:39,052
kind of character game, is a kind of a roguelike story character game.

657
00:26:40,013 --> 00:26:50,084
So, in conclusion, I would say that the indie apocalypse, in general, as a concept, isn't real, but something has changed, right?

658
00:26:50,104 --> 00:26:56,551
And I think what we've had maybe is more like a consumable game-pocalypse, which doesn't really roll off the tongue so well.

659
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:01,965
So my sort of take-home message,

660
00:27:02,265 --> 00:27:05,426
if you wanna reduce your risk in this modern ecosystem,

661
00:27:05,906 --> 00:27:06,506
it's pretty simple.

662
00:27:07,866 --> 00:27:09,727
Make unique situation generators.

663
00:27:10,707 --> 00:27:12,548
And it's kind of an interesting piece of advice

664
00:27:12,568 --> 00:27:13,128
to be giving, right?

665
00:27:13,148 --> 00:27:16,769
Because even if the indie apocalypse hadn't happened,

666
00:27:17,149 --> 00:27:18,929
I might still be giving people that advice in general.

667
00:27:18,949 --> 00:27:19,870
Because in my opinion,

668
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:21,870
these seem like the most interesting kinds of games

669
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,391
to be making anyway.

670
00:27:23,531 --> 00:27:26,451
So I think we actually have three minutes for questions.

671
00:27:26,531 --> 00:27:26,812
Thank you.

672
00:27:37,157 --> 00:27:39,697
Anybody, I'm totally, at 41, I'm totally blinded

673
00:27:39,717 --> 00:27:40,178
by these lights.

674
00:27:41,298 --> 00:27:41,798
It's happening.

675
00:27:45,199 --> 00:27:45,319
Hey.

676
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,601
Curse me, I'm gonna keep making consumable games.

677
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:51,862
I love them too much, I can't stop myself,

678
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:53,122
and I'm never gonna stop myself.

679
00:27:53,622 --> 00:27:55,443
Do you have any advice for me?

680
00:27:55,463 --> 00:27:57,183
Yeah.

681
00:27:57,323 --> 00:27:57,443
Yeah.

682
00:27:57,764 --> 00:27:58,664
Yeah.

683
00:27:59,064 --> 00:28:01,785
Well, when I talked to a couple people

684
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:02,925
about this talk ahead of time,

685
00:28:03,686 --> 00:28:05,206
this, you know, yesterday and the day before,

686
00:28:06,846 --> 00:28:08,447
you know, people, other game developers,

687
00:28:08,647 --> 00:28:09,868
they point out counter examples, right?

688
00:28:09,948 --> 00:28:11,569
And like The Witness is a counter example.

689
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:13,811
And someone else pointed out Firewatch.

690
00:28:14,511 --> 00:28:15,672
I have not played Dream Daddy yet.

691
00:28:16,673 --> 00:28:18,794
I think it probably is creating all sorts of unique situations,

692
00:28:18,935 --> 00:28:21,316
but, you know, it was definitely sort of one of these,

693
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,877
like, launch hype kind of games where, like,

694
00:28:22,977 --> 00:28:24,158
everyone's talking about it when it comes out.

695
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:25,679
So, I mean, there's definitely...

696
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:30,267
If a game is, you know, I guess inspiring enough or interesting enough to people, it'll overcome.

697
00:28:30,287 --> 00:28:33,753
It doesn't need to grow long term, right? It can get enough interest on that one day.

698
00:28:33,773 --> 00:28:37,199
So that's the real challenge, right? Like somehow in this environment...

699
00:28:38,952 --> 00:28:42,214
when there is no, like, One Hour in Life eventually,

700
00:28:42,234 --> 00:28:43,755
I didn't get to talk about this in the talk,

701
00:28:43,775 --> 00:28:45,096
but One Hour in Life eventually made it

702
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:47,858
onto the front page of Steam after about a week and a half.

703
00:28:48,418 --> 00:28:49,599
Because Steam, what they're doing now,

704
00:28:49,619 --> 00:28:51,441
they're no longer just picking games from the front page,

705
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:53,102
they're just like, letting their algorithms

706
00:28:53,142 --> 00:28:55,243
kind of look for patterns and what players are enjoying

707
00:28:55,303 --> 00:28:56,444
and what people are actually playing,

708
00:28:56,824 --> 00:28:58,245
and then those games kind of float to the top

709
00:28:58,285 --> 00:28:59,166
and get recommended, right?

710
00:28:59,206 --> 00:29:01,087
So that was also something in that curve

711
00:29:01,107 --> 00:29:02,408
that I didn't have a chance to talk about.

712
00:29:04,129 --> 00:29:08,352
So that is like, you know, if it's all your eggs are in one basket on that launch day

713
00:29:08,392 --> 00:29:11,534
and people aren't really going to be playing your game a week from now, because all your

714
00:29:11,674 --> 00:29:13,776
biggest fans are done with it already, right?

715
00:29:13,816 --> 00:29:15,978
How do you build that long-term, you know, thing?

716
00:29:16,018 --> 00:29:16,558
I don't know.

717
00:29:16,718 --> 00:29:17,198
It's a challenge.

718
00:29:17,379 --> 00:29:21,461
You just have to make something so blindingly awesome that people can't avoid buying it.

719
00:29:24,006 --> 00:29:24,647
Is there someone over here?

720
00:29:24,767 --> 00:29:24,987
Yes.

721
00:29:25,528 --> 00:29:26,188
Thank you for the talk.

722
00:29:26,509 --> 00:29:26,929
Really good.

723
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:30,934
Was wondering if you think the volume of games

724
00:29:31,134 --> 00:29:33,837
also affected the quote unquote indiepocalypse,

725
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:37,501
how between 2006 and 2012, it was significantly harder

726
00:29:37,521 --> 00:29:38,662
to publish your game on Steam.

727
00:29:39,042 --> 00:29:40,764
And then let's just say afterward,

728
00:29:41,705 --> 00:29:43,227
with Greenlight and then Direct, it

729
00:29:43,247 --> 00:29:46,110
was much easier to go and get your game out there.

730
00:29:46,991 --> 00:29:50,274
Well, I mean, that would certainly magnify the number of failure stories we're going

731
00:29:50,294 --> 00:29:50,654
to hear, right?

732
00:29:50,694 --> 00:29:54,358
Because a lot more games are going on Steam, probably a lot of the games that are going

733
00:29:54,398 --> 00:29:58,902
on Steam, just as this bandwagon effect, like everybody's like, I'm going to make a game,

734
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:00,664
I'm going to be a good game designer, it's my first game.

735
00:30:00,724 --> 00:30:03,967
Like, there's probably a lot of those games aren't that great or aren't that interesting.

736
00:30:03,987 --> 00:30:05,568
I don't want to make blanket statements here, right?

737
00:30:05,608 --> 00:30:09,332
But just like if we have this dogpile of 42 games every day, and everyone's like, my game

738
00:30:09,352 --> 00:30:09,932
didn't sell.

739
00:30:09,992 --> 00:30:11,013
Well, uh.

740
00:30:11,174 --> 00:30:11,894
I mean, it is true.

741
00:30:12,234 --> 00:30:14,375
Going back to 2011, which I didn't talk about here,

742
00:30:14,435 --> 00:30:16,896
when Inside a Star-Filled Sky, which was my first Steam game,

743
00:30:17,637 --> 00:30:20,378
going back to 2010, they rejected Sleep is Death

744
00:30:20,458 --> 00:30:21,999
outright and said, we don't want it on Steam.

745
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,321
Inside a Star-Filled Sky, I had to talk to Edmund.

746
00:30:25,341 --> 00:30:26,461
Do you have a contact at Steam?

747
00:30:27,042 --> 00:30:30,684
I pulled a friend connection to get some contact at Steam,

748
00:30:30,724 --> 00:30:32,104
show them Inside a Star-Filled Sky.

749
00:30:32,465 --> 00:30:33,805
I said, look, I've already sold $40,000 on my own website.

750
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:33,985
$40,000, guys!

751
00:30:38,091 --> 00:30:39,492
And they were like, OK, OK.

752
00:30:39,512 --> 00:30:40,273
You twisted our arm.

753
00:30:40,293 --> 00:30:41,013
We'll let it unseam.

754
00:30:41,333 --> 00:30:43,415
But they jockeyed with me for release day.

755
00:30:43,895 --> 00:30:45,216
They're like, oh, you're coming out on Monday.

756
00:30:45,256 --> 00:30:45,576
No, wait.

757
00:30:45,596 --> 00:30:46,617
There's another game coming out on Monday.

758
00:30:46,637 --> 00:30:47,377
You're on Thursday now.

759
00:30:47,417 --> 00:30:49,259
Back and forth for like, and it kind of

760
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:50,359
irritated me a little bit.

761
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,461
But they actually gave me a day when no other games were coming.

762
00:30:53,674 --> 00:30:54,874
And I was handpicked by them.

763
00:30:55,555 --> 00:30:56,895
And the Castle Doctrine as well,

764
00:30:56,935 --> 00:30:58,356
they kind of jockeyed with me for release day.

765
00:30:58,376 --> 00:30:59,857
So yes, things have changed drastically

766
00:30:59,877 --> 00:31:00,817
in the way that that is handled.

767
00:31:01,177 --> 00:31:02,518
It's definitely way more flooded.

768
00:31:03,378 --> 00:31:04,239
But you know, a game like,

769
00:31:04,439 --> 00:31:05,639
some of the games I put up on the screen

770
00:31:05,659 --> 00:31:06,380
for the Indie Apocalypse,

771
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,261
they had plenty of press attention, right?

772
00:31:08,281 --> 00:31:09,841
They had plenty of factors

773
00:31:09,861 --> 00:31:11,202
that would make them stand out from the crowd.

774
00:31:11,622 --> 00:31:13,583
They were just really depending on that,

775
00:31:13,643 --> 00:31:15,964
as opposed to this long-term sort of viral success, right?

776
00:31:16,245 --> 00:31:17,825
Yeah, it's almost as if there was more demand

777
00:31:17,925 --> 00:31:20,567
for games and less titles back in those years.

778
00:31:20,947 --> 00:31:21,667
That's kind of one of like,

779
00:31:21,984 --> 00:31:25,966
Right, I mean basically getting a game on Steam meant a certain amount of money just sort of flat out, right?

780
00:31:25,986 --> 00:31:27,807
Just because you'd get eyeballs for a whole week.

781
00:31:28,827 --> 00:31:31,888
And it meant that Steam had picked your game and the people at Steam thought it was good enough.

782
00:31:32,649 --> 00:31:34,930
Right, and that doesn't, being on Steam doesn't mean that anymore, right?

783
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:37,951
Your game hasn't really been vetted aside from not violating Steam's rules.

784
00:31:38,931 --> 00:31:40,432
So, we have another question over here. We got...

785
00:31:42,193 --> 00:31:44,313
We're out of time, I guess. One more quick one?

786
00:31:44,774 --> 00:31:48,575
Really quick, would you be willing to share how many wish lists you had before you launched?

787
00:31:50,221 --> 00:31:51,665
I don't know that number, I'm sorry.

788
00:31:52,468 --> 00:31:53,692
That's a good quick question to end on.

789
00:31:54,474 --> 00:31:55,016
Thank you everybody.
