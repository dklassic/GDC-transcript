1
00:00:05,992 --> 00:00:10,133
Okay, looks like it's time for me to start. Just a reminder, if

2
00:00:10,133 --> 00:00:12,614
you could shut off your cell phones and remember to fill out

3
00:00:12,614 --> 00:00:15,175
the evaluation forms after we're over. Can everybody hear me in

4
00:00:15,175 --> 00:00:19,536
the back? Good, good. Thank you. All right. My name is Paul

5
00:00:19,536 --> 00:00:22,778
Tozer. I'm here to talk about the Game Outcomes Project and

6
00:00:22,778 --> 00:00:25,619
what it taught us about the science of creating effective

7
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:29,820
teams and how teamwork, leadership and culture drive

8
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:30,280
outcomes.

9
00:00:37,832 --> 00:00:46,426
Okay. My surface pro 4 has hung. Apparently. Oh, there we go.

10
00:00:46,426 --> 00:00:48,729
Got something. Okay. So, I'm going to go ahead and do this.

11
00:00:51,959 --> 00:00:54,401
Quick introduction, I'm the owner and general manager

12
00:00:54,401 --> 00:00:57,243
of Mothership Entertainment in Austin, a small studio

13
00:00:57,243 --> 00:01:01,086
building an unannounced science fiction strategy game.

14
00:01:01,086 --> 00:01:03,708
I also earned an MSC in technology management

15
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:05,749
from University of Pennsylvania and the Wharton School

16
00:01:05,749 --> 00:01:06,130
of Business.

17
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:07,571
And the only reason that's relevant

18
00:01:07,571 --> 00:01:10,233
is because the Wharton School of Business

19
00:01:10,233 --> 00:01:13,615
inspired the Game Outcomes Project.

20
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,396
Not a consultant.

21
00:01:15,396 --> 00:01:17,578
I'm not trying to sell you anything.

22
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm a 22-year industry veteran motivated

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,401
by intellectual curiosity.

24
00:01:23,161 --> 00:01:27,106
I'd like to take the opportunity to introduce the Game Outcomes Project team.

25
00:01:27,106 --> 00:01:31,851
We are an independent, industry-academic partnership.

26
00:01:31,851 --> 00:01:39,480
In the upper left, Dr. Karen Vureau of McEwen University was our enormous help with statistics.

27
00:01:40,012 --> 00:01:44,456
Also, Juliana Pillimer of the Wharton School of Business.

28
00:01:44,456 --> 00:01:45,517
She is a PhD student.

29
00:01:45,517 --> 00:01:46,998
She helped us a lot with our question design.

30
00:01:46,998 --> 00:01:51,322
Our industry members included Eric Byron, David Wegbright,

31
00:01:51,322 --> 00:01:55,846
Jinghua Yang, also known as Z, Ben Weber, Lucian Parsons,

32
00:01:55,846 --> 00:01:58,268
and Endark Tang, who translated all of our articles

33
00:01:58,268 --> 00:01:59,249
into Chinese.

34
00:01:59,249 --> 00:02:01,090
I'd also like to thank those of you

35
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,932
in the audience who participated in the study.

36
00:02:02,932 --> 00:02:04,573
It would not have been possible without you.

37
00:02:06,263 --> 00:02:07,544
A couple of quick notes, I'm going

38
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:10,446
to be doing the starting with the survey design and notes

39
00:02:10,446 --> 00:02:11,867
on how we design the survey.

40
00:02:11,867 --> 00:02:13,548
Going to talk about non-cultural factors.

41
00:02:13,548 --> 00:02:16,209
Going to talk a little bit about crunch.

42
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:17,390
Going to talk about culture.

43
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:21,253
Going to very briefly discuss non-correlated factors,

44
00:02:21,253 --> 00:02:23,935
and then draw some conclusions from that.

45
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:24,995
So in the fall of 2014.

46
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:26,810
our team designed a survey.

47
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,311
We decided to ask game developers

48
00:02:28,311 --> 00:02:31,453
a bunch of questions about their most recently finished game

49
00:02:31,453 --> 00:02:32,093
project.

50
00:02:32,093 --> 00:02:34,554
This included 116 questions about culture,

51
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:38,296
followed by four questions about the project's outcome.

52
00:02:38,296 --> 00:02:41,157
We thought, OK, there have to be at least some factors

53
00:02:41,157 --> 00:02:43,538
in this list about team culture that are going to correlate

54
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:44,639
with success or failure.

55
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:46,800
And if we can get a couple hundred responses

56
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,241
and we can correlate them and see which of the responses

57
00:02:50,241 --> 00:02:52,202
are positively and negatively correlated

58
00:02:52,202 --> 00:02:53,463
with different kinds of outcomes,

59
00:02:53,463 --> 00:02:54,543
we can learn a lot from that.

60
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,604
So this was a first of its kind correlational study that

61
00:02:58,604 --> 00:03:01,868
correlated a development team's internal culture with their

62
00:03:01,868 --> 00:03:02,749
actual results.

63
00:03:03,685 --> 00:03:06,526
We received 273 responses from game projects

64
00:03:06,526 --> 00:03:09,707
that had neither been canceled nor abandoned

65
00:03:09,707 --> 00:03:10,487
during development.

66
00:03:10,487 --> 00:03:12,767
And based on that, we did a lot of data analysis

67
00:03:12,767 --> 00:03:15,068
and wrote up a series of five articles on GammaCitra.

68
00:03:15,068 --> 00:03:17,929
And for those of you who have read the GammaCitra articles,

69
00:03:17,929 --> 00:03:19,369
I want to assure you that a lot of the data

70
00:03:19,369 --> 00:03:22,310
that you're going to see today is different in its form,

71
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:25,790
if not the conclusions, from what was in the five GammaCitra

72
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:26,551
articles.

73
00:03:26,551 --> 00:03:30,171
Our hypothesis was that different teams

74
00:03:30,171 --> 00:03:31,572
have different cultures.

75
00:03:31,572 --> 00:03:31,852
And.

76
00:03:34,215 --> 00:03:37,618
We also hypothesized that chance always plays a role in game

77
00:03:37,618 --> 00:03:40,421
development, but we felt certain that outcomes

78
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:43,343
have to be strongly influenced by their team

79
00:03:43,343 --> 00:03:45,185
culture in the aggregate.

80
00:03:45,185 --> 00:03:47,887
And we certainly found that the first one is undeniably true,

81
00:03:47,887 --> 00:03:50,049
and we believe strongly the second one is true as well.

82
00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:54,553
And we'll talk about why we feel that way a little later on.

83
00:03:54,553 --> 00:03:55,995
So we wanted to know, is this true?

84
00:03:55,995 --> 00:03:58,877
And if so, which cultural factors most strongly

85
00:03:58,877 --> 00:04:00,759
influence the odds of success, and what

86
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:01,720
can we learn from that?

87
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:07,227
We had an optional question at the end asking game developers

88
00:04:07,227 --> 00:04:08,868
what project they were actually referring to.

89
00:04:08,868 --> 00:04:11,689
I'm not going to read through this whole list.

90
00:04:11,689 --> 00:04:13,130
Only fewer than 5% of respondents

91
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:15,191
actually told us which game they were referring to.

92
00:04:15,191 --> 00:04:18,713
But based on that, we know that our 270 responses included,

93
00:04:18,713 --> 00:04:21,414
at the very least, these games.

94
00:04:21,414 --> 00:04:22,475
Survey design.

95
00:04:22,475 --> 00:04:25,036
A few disclaimers before we start.

96
00:04:25,036 --> 00:04:27,297
This study was not an academic paper,

97
00:04:27,297 --> 00:04:28,318
so it was not peer reviewed.

98
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,691
It's an ex post facto analysis.

99
00:04:30,691 --> 00:04:33,512
In other words, it's based on a survey asking people

100
00:04:33,512 --> 00:04:36,253
about projects they recently completed.

101
00:04:36,253 --> 00:04:38,254
In an ideal world, of course, we'd have a time machine.

102
00:04:38,254 --> 00:04:40,595
And we could do a little A-B testing, go back in time,

103
00:04:40,595 --> 00:04:43,936
find the same development team, and say, OK, same people,

104
00:04:43,936 --> 00:04:46,817
same time, working on the exact same game project.

105
00:04:46,817 --> 00:04:49,158
Now I want you to make a slightly different decision.

106
00:04:49,542 --> 00:04:50,183
during development.

107
00:04:50,183 --> 00:04:52,324
I want you to use Scrum instead of Agile,

108
00:04:52,324 --> 00:04:54,346
or Waterfall instead of Scrum, or I

109
00:04:54,346 --> 00:04:56,547
want you to decide not to crunch instead of crunching.

110
00:04:56,547 --> 00:04:58,109
How does that affect your outcome?

111
00:04:58,109 --> 00:05:00,751
The reality is, of course, we have no way of doing that.

112
00:05:00,751 --> 00:05:03,453
There is no way to get exactly the same team

113
00:05:03,453 --> 00:05:07,095
to do the same thing twice, because they will have learned

114
00:05:07,095 --> 00:05:08,116
the first time going through.

115
00:05:08,116 --> 00:05:12,960
So in the real world, there's no way to run that experiment.

116
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,582
So it's subject to cognitive biases.

117
00:05:15,924 --> 00:05:18,407
I might look back on a project with a disastrous ending

118
00:05:18,407 --> 00:05:19,849
and be bitter about that, and that

119
00:05:19,849 --> 00:05:22,192
might affect my survey response.

120
00:05:22,192 --> 00:05:23,994
Finally, correlation isn't causation.

121
00:05:23,994 --> 00:05:26,978
Our study gave us a ton of correlations we can look at,

122
00:05:26,978 --> 00:05:30,062
but we can't technically prove that any of these correlations

123
00:05:30,062 --> 00:05:32,164
are causal factors by themselves.

124
00:05:32,164 --> 00:05:34,608
And I'll discuss correlation and causation a little bit

125
00:05:34,608 --> 00:05:35,328
later in the talk.

126
00:05:36,468 --> 00:05:40,292
A few quick notes about our survey design and the steps we took to minimize bias.

127
00:05:40,292 --> 00:05:45,016
We randomized the order of the cultural questions in SurveyMonkey to remove any influence that

128
00:05:45,016 --> 00:05:48,418
a single ordering might have had on the way the questions were answered.

129
00:05:48,418 --> 00:05:52,582
We had a lot of redundant questions where we'd ask the same question twice with redundant

130
00:05:52,582 --> 00:05:52,842
tones.

131
00:05:52,842 --> 00:05:55,444
We would ask, did the team do X?

132
00:05:55,444 --> 00:05:57,966
In addition to asking, did the team avoid doing X?

133
00:05:57,966 --> 00:06:03,771
And it was very interesting because we found there was an almost perfect inverse correlation

134
00:06:03,771 --> 00:06:04,652
between those answers.

135
00:06:04,652 --> 00:06:04,772
So...

136
00:06:05,223 --> 00:06:07,205
The fact of the matter is those questions

137
00:06:07,205 --> 00:06:07,845
were kind of redundant.

138
00:06:07,845 --> 00:06:09,606
We could have cut down on the number of questions

139
00:06:09,606 --> 00:06:11,467
just by choosing one or the other.

140
00:06:11,467 --> 00:06:14,409
But it was a nice reinforcement that our questions were being

141
00:06:14,409 --> 00:06:16,210
answered honestly and accurately.

142
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,732
Finally, we asked our four questions about outcomes

143
00:06:18,732 --> 00:06:20,893
at the very end of the study because we

144
00:06:20,893 --> 00:06:23,234
didn't want to bias anyone about what we were actually

145
00:06:23,234 --> 00:06:25,516
looking for when asking the culture questions.

146
00:06:27,876 --> 00:06:30,619
Let's talk about what we mean by outcomes.

147
00:06:30,619 --> 00:06:33,443
Obviously, there's no single definition

148
00:06:33,443 --> 00:06:34,364
of what makes a good outcome.

149
00:06:34,364 --> 00:06:36,727
Different game projects have different goals

150
00:06:36,727 --> 00:06:38,589
and different definitions of success.

151
00:06:38,589 --> 00:06:40,692
If you're working on a AAA project,

152
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:43,755
you probably care more than anything else

153
00:06:43,755 --> 00:06:45,157
about your return on investment.

154
00:06:46,061 --> 00:06:47,662
If you're working on an indie project,

155
00:06:47,662 --> 00:06:49,343
maybe you care more about critical acclaim.

156
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,745
If it's your first time making a video game,

157
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,006
maybe you just care about getting it done.

158
00:06:54,006 --> 00:06:55,948
Maybe you're trying to make a political statement

159
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:56,428
with your game.

160
00:06:56,428 --> 00:06:58,790
Maybe you're trying to kill fascists

161
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,851
like Woody Guthrie's guitar or something like that,

162
00:07:00,851 --> 00:07:01,472
and that's fine.

163
00:07:01,472 --> 00:07:03,453
So in that case, maybe you care more

164
00:07:03,453 --> 00:07:05,815
about your team's internal satisfaction

165
00:07:05,815 --> 00:07:07,516
with meeting your project goals.

166
00:07:07,516 --> 00:07:10,578
So our team came up with a list of four factors

167
00:07:10,578 --> 00:07:13,039
that we felt most developers would agree

168
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,941
generally describe positive outcomes.

169
00:07:15,923 --> 00:07:18,090
Our feeling was that most game developers would say,

170
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:20,697
these are the factors that generally describe success.

171
00:07:24,255 --> 00:07:25,596
So we asked the following four questions.

172
00:07:25,596 --> 00:07:27,818
I'm not going to read all these in the interest of time.

173
00:07:27,818 --> 00:07:29,519
So we asked things like, to the best of your knowledge,

174
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:31,761
what was the game's financial return on investment or ROI?

175
00:07:31,761 --> 00:07:33,662
In other words, what kind of profit or loss

176
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:34,983
did the company developing the game

177
00:07:34,983 --> 00:07:36,404
take as a result of publication?

178
00:07:36,404 --> 00:07:38,326
And we'd ask this on a seven point scale.

179
00:07:38,326 --> 00:07:41,628
And all four of these questions were on a six or seven point

180
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:41,888
scale.

181
00:07:41,888 --> 00:07:44,690
So we were able to take those four questions,

182
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:47,392
convert them into normalized values between 0 and 1.

183
00:07:48,205 --> 00:07:51,587
Then multiply each of those by 20, well, I'll get to that a

184
00:07:51,587 --> 00:07:52,747
little later.

185
00:07:52,747 --> 00:07:55,628
So we felt it made sense to combine all four of those into

186
00:07:55,628 --> 00:07:57,088
an aggregate outcome score.

187
00:07:57,088 --> 00:08:00,650
Our view was that a truly successful project was one

188
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:04,531
that had a good ROI, was completed on time, received

189
00:08:04,531 --> 00:08:07,192
high critical acclaim, and that the team

190
00:08:07,192 --> 00:08:08,633
felt achieved its goals.

191
00:08:09,548 --> 00:08:10,809
We tried a bunch of different ways

192
00:08:10,809 --> 00:08:12,811
of building that aggregate outcome score.

193
00:08:12,811 --> 00:08:14,393
We tried one based on probability theory,

194
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:16,215
multiplying the outcome scores together.

195
00:08:16,215 --> 00:08:17,656
We tried one based on weighted sums

196
00:08:17,656 --> 00:08:18,777
and tuning the optimal weights.

197
00:08:18,777 --> 00:08:21,160
In the end, we found that the thing that worked best

198
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,323
and correlated the best with everything else in the study

199
00:08:24,323 --> 00:08:27,166
was simply adding those four scores together.

200
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:28,748
So we've got four values between 0 and 1.

201
00:08:28,748 --> 00:08:30,189
Just add them together.

202
00:08:30,189 --> 00:08:31,911
And then that number between 0 and 4.

203
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,861
correlated better than anything else we came up with.

204
00:08:37,861 --> 00:08:40,222
So we stuck with that.

205
00:08:40,222 --> 00:08:43,143
And then we multiplied that value by 25

206
00:08:43,143 --> 00:08:43,823
to get a number between 0 and 100.

207
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:44,683
So it's like a letter grade.

208
00:08:44,683 --> 00:08:47,744
So we have a bunch of cultural factors

209
00:08:47,744 --> 00:08:50,345
as represented by over 110 survey questions.

210
00:08:50,345 --> 00:08:53,206
And we can correlate any individual culture question

211
00:08:53,206 --> 00:08:56,247
or group of questions with any one of those outcomes

212
00:08:56,247 --> 00:08:57,667
and the aggregate outcome score.

213
00:08:57,667 --> 00:08:59,708
But what does that correlation mean?

214
00:09:00,463 --> 00:09:02,144
For example, maybe we find that teams

215
00:09:02,144 --> 00:09:04,785
that used more outsourced labor instead of internal labor

216
00:09:04,785 --> 00:09:07,046
influences the aggregate outcome in some way.

217
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,527
Maybe it makes it higher or lower.

218
00:09:08,527 --> 00:09:11,529
What can we read into that?

219
00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:14,370
Well, because the outcomes happened after the game shipped,

220
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,952
there's really no way the outcomes could have

221
00:09:16,952 --> 00:09:18,292
caused the cultural factors.

222
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:20,774
So if there's any causal relationship at all,

223
00:09:20,774 --> 00:09:23,935
it has to be the cultural factors causing the outcomes.

224
00:09:25,043 --> 00:09:27,604
Now, sure, it's a survey, and it's possible somebody's memory

225
00:09:27,604 --> 00:09:29,325
of the teen culture while taking the survey

226
00:09:29,325 --> 00:09:30,825
was influenced by the outcome.

227
00:09:30,825 --> 00:09:33,946
That's possible, and maybe it biased the survey a little bit.

228
00:09:33,946 --> 00:09:37,267
But assuming bias didn't sway the survey too much,

229
00:09:37,267 --> 00:09:39,327
either there is no causal relationship,

230
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:44,129
or it's the cultural factors or some other factors behind them

231
00:09:44,129 --> 00:09:45,069
causing the outcome.

232
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:48,704
A quick note on the statistics used in our analysis

233
00:09:48,704 --> 00:09:49,745
of the survey results.

234
00:09:49,745 --> 00:09:51,627
Not going to go into this in too much detail.

235
00:09:51,627 --> 00:09:53,248
Most of you are probably familiar with the concept

236
00:09:53,248 --> 00:09:53,929
of a correlation.

237
00:09:53,929 --> 00:09:56,151
Just to be sure, here's a quick refresher.

238
00:09:56,151 --> 00:09:57,712
The correlation between two variables

239
00:09:57,712 --> 00:09:59,594
is the degree to which those variables show

240
00:09:59,594 --> 00:10:00,755
a tendency to vary together.

241
00:10:00,755 --> 00:10:02,356
So you see the little boxes.

242
00:10:02,356 --> 00:10:04,198
The one on the far upper right, there's no correlation.

243
00:10:04,551 --> 00:10:07,833
X and Y have nothing to do with each other if I know the value of X.

244
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,493
I cannot say anything about the value of Y.

245
00:10:09,493 --> 00:10:14,416
In the upper left hand corner, that's a perfect, almost perfect inverse correlation.

246
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:16,437
As X gets bigger, Y gets smaller.

247
00:10:16,437 --> 00:10:19,098
And so I can say a lot about the value of Y if I know the value of X.

248
00:10:19,098 --> 00:10:23,180
Similarly, in the lower right corner, we have a perfect positive correlation.

249
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,302
X and Y both get bigger or smaller together.

250
00:10:26,302 --> 00:10:28,523
So if I know the value of Y, I can perfectly state

251
00:10:28,523 --> 00:10:30,603
the value of, if I know the value of X,

252
00:10:30,603 --> 00:10:33,325
I can perfectly state the value of Y.

253
00:10:33,325 --> 00:10:35,986
We used a Spearman correlation with the outcome score

254
00:10:35,986 --> 00:10:36,786
for most questions.

255
00:10:36,786 --> 00:10:38,527
I'm not gonna go into details on that.

256
00:10:38,527 --> 00:10:40,007
Look it up on Google if you're interested.

257
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:42,368
I'm sure Google can explain it much better than I can.

258
00:10:42,368 --> 00:10:46,150
And the reason we used Spearman instead of the more popular

259
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:48,011
and commonly used Pearson correlation

260
00:10:48,011 --> 00:10:49,211
was because many of our questions

261
00:10:49,211 --> 00:10:50,492
were based on a Likert scale.

262
00:10:50,492 --> 00:10:52,533
For questions.

263
00:10:54,289 --> 00:10:56,750
that had two mutually exclusive answers,

264
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,791
we used a Wilcoxon rank-sum test

265
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,933
to detect significant differences.

266
00:11:01,933 --> 00:11:06,475
For questions with more than two mutually exclusive answers,

267
00:11:06,475 --> 00:11:09,316
we used the Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance.

268
00:11:11,569 --> 00:11:12,850
But again, if you're interested, Google it.

269
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:13,550
Look it up in the articles.

270
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:16,211
There's a lot more detail there that I can't get into.

271
00:11:16,211 --> 00:11:18,452
So let's assume we have some cultural factor like teams

272
00:11:18,452 --> 00:11:19,212
that drink coffee.

273
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:21,073
Obviously, we didn't actually ask

274
00:11:21,073 --> 00:11:22,614
about coffee drinking in the study, but let's roll with it.

275
00:11:22,614 --> 00:11:25,515
So we find the answers to that question on our survey

276
00:11:25,515 --> 00:11:27,896
correlate with higher values on the outcome scale

277
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:30,057
for project delays, higher meaning better.

278
00:11:30,057 --> 00:11:31,897
The graph might look something like this.

279
00:11:31,897 --> 00:11:33,918
The gray dots form a rising diagonal line,

280
00:11:33,918 --> 00:11:36,479
and there's a strong positive correlation

281
00:11:36,479 --> 00:11:38,480
between coffee drinking and teams

282
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,801
that shift the games on time.

283
00:11:40,969 --> 00:11:42,833
What claims can we make about this?

284
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:45,138
If we have a correlation like this,

285
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:47,423
can we say that drinking more coffee

286
00:11:47,423 --> 00:11:49,528
improves your odds of shifting a game on time?

287
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:53,219
Well, no, not exactly.

288
00:11:53,219 --> 00:11:55,762
But we can say that one of three things must be happening.

289
00:11:55,762 --> 00:11:58,185
First, there might be no causal relationship.

290
00:11:58,185 --> 00:12:00,768
Depending on the statistical p-value of the correlation,

291
00:12:00,768 --> 00:12:03,470
we can rule that out as highly unlikely in some cases.

292
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:05,513
And we talk about p-values in the articles.

293
00:12:05,513 --> 00:12:06,914
I don't really have time to get into it here.

294
00:12:06,914 --> 00:12:08,556
Again, I strongly recommend googling that

295
00:12:08,556 --> 00:12:09,397
if you're interested.

296
00:12:09,397 --> 00:12:10,798
Briefly, the p-value is a measure

297
00:12:10,798 --> 00:12:13,141
of how likely the results are to have occurred by chance.

298
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:20,063
The second possibility is that maybe A really does cause B and maybe drinking more coffee really does help you ship on time.

299
00:12:20,063 --> 00:12:23,925
The third possibility is maybe there's some other hidden causal factor involved.

300
00:12:23,925 --> 00:12:31,448
For example, maybe we've just hired people who work harder and harder working people happen to drink more coffee.

301
00:12:31,448 --> 00:12:33,589
That's totally a possibility.

302
00:12:33,589 --> 00:12:36,650
But it does let us pretty much rule out the opposite.

303
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:41,892
If someone says, hey, drinking coffee actually hurts your chances of shipping a game on time,

304
00:12:41,892 --> 00:12:43,093
we can show them this chart.

305
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:46,212
and say, OK, if that were the case,

306
00:12:46,212 --> 00:12:48,474
it should have shown up in this chart.

307
00:12:48,474 --> 00:12:51,436
We should see an inverse correlation,

308
00:12:51,436 --> 00:12:52,437
but we see a positive correlation instead.

309
00:12:52,437 --> 00:12:54,838
And you can say, OK, for any correlations where

310
00:12:54,838 --> 00:12:58,181
we find the statistical p-values are low enough to pretty much

311
00:12:58,181 --> 00:13:01,223
rule out coincidence, we can say that there could have been

312
00:13:01,223 --> 00:13:04,685
some other hidden input c, which accounts for the results,

313
00:13:04,685 --> 00:13:07,527
some hidden causal factor like just hiring better people.

314
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:11,389
But we asked over 110 questions over a very broad range

315
00:13:11,389 --> 00:13:12,570
of cultural factors.

316
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:14,391
And it's very hard to imagine that there really

317
00:13:14,391 --> 00:13:15,752
is very much we left out of it.

318
00:13:15,752 --> 00:13:17,493
So we can't 100% rule out the idea

319
00:13:17,493 --> 00:13:20,315
that maybe more successful teams just hire better people.

320
00:13:20,315 --> 00:13:22,296
And the correlations of all the culture questions

321
00:13:22,296 --> 00:13:23,857
were just coincidence.

322
00:13:23,857 --> 00:13:26,318
And there's some magical thing those better people are

323
00:13:26,318 --> 00:13:29,120
doing that isn't accounted for in our survey questions.

324
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,421
That's totally a possibility.

325
00:13:30,421 --> 00:13:31,341
We can't rule that out.

326
00:13:31,341 --> 00:13:32,602
And you're welcome to believe there

327
00:13:32,602 --> 00:13:33,563
are other factors involved.

328
00:13:34,936 --> 00:13:36,757
But what I would ask you to think about is this.

329
00:13:36,757 --> 00:13:39,579
If you find there are things that other teams are doing

330
00:13:39,579 --> 00:13:42,321
that are strongly correlated with success or failure,

331
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,382
it might not hurt to learn about them

332
00:13:44,382 --> 00:13:46,503
and see how that applies to your own teams.

333
00:13:46,503 --> 00:13:50,946
Maybe there's some other factor involved, and maybe not.

334
00:13:50,946 --> 00:13:53,128
But if there are simple changes you

335
00:13:53,128 --> 00:13:55,769
can make that might impact your outcomes, why not make them?

336
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:58,111
I'm going to start off the discussion of the results

337
00:13:58,111 --> 00:13:59,892
with what I'll call non-cultural factors.

338
00:14:03,387 --> 00:14:05,829
This is a graph of the average team size plotted against the

339
00:14:05,829 --> 00:14:08,410
aggregate outcome. The horizontal axis is the team

340
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:11,772
size based on logarithmic scale with larger teams toward the

341
00:14:11,772 --> 00:14:14,874
right. The vertical axis is the outcome with better outcomes at

342
00:14:14,874 --> 00:14:18,436
the top. We've also colored the dots based on outcomes so green

343
00:14:18,436 --> 00:14:21,959
is better, red is bad. So as you can see the trend line goes

344
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:24,200
upward toward the right indicating the very large teams

345
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,582
seem to have slightly better outcomes although the

346
00:14:26,582 --> 00:14:28,583
correlation here is not statistically significant.

347
00:14:30,505 --> 00:14:33,087
The total project duration had a negative correlation,

348
00:14:33,087 --> 00:14:35,850
and it was statistically significant.

349
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:38,812
You'll notice the black trend line here goes downward.

350
00:14:38,812 --> 00:14:41,975
And the horizontal axis is the total project duration.

351
00:14:41,975 --> 00:14:44,417
But that's not really surprising.

352
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:46,339
Projects that are in trouble are naturally

353
00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:49,201
going to take longer and experience more project delays.

354
00:14:49,201 --> 00:14:51,543
So nobody should really be surprised by this.

355
00:14:51,543 --> 00:14:54,005
We asked five yes or no questions

356
00:14:54,005 --> 00:14:55,646
about financial incentives.

357
00:14:55,646 --> 00:14:58,469
If you're spending money, or at least offering money

358
00:14:58,469 --> 00:14:59,710
to try to motivate your team.

359
00:15:00,325 --> 00:15:04,109
it's interesting to ask whether it really makes a difference.

360
00:15:04,109 --> 00:15:05,571
And for four out of five of those,

361
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,814
we found there was absolutely no significant correlation.

362
00:15:08,814 --> 00:15:11,097
From left to right, we're looking at team-based

363
00:15:11,097 --> 00:15:14,140
incentives, incentives based on royalties,

364
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,743
incentives based on Metacritic review scores,

365
00:15:16,743 --> 00:15:19,225
and other royalties.

366
00:15:19,225 --> 00:15:22,148
And in each case, the no answer is on the left,

367
00:15:22,148 --> 00:15:23,490
and the yes answer is on the right.

368
00:15:24,329 --> 00:15:28,571
and we used a Wilcoxon rank sum test to detect significance in results here.

369
00:15:28,571 --> 00:15:31,752
The one place where financial incentives did make a difference

370
00:15:31,752 --> 00:15:35,074
was with individually tailored financial incentives.

371
00:15:35,074 --> 00:15:37,295
In other words, pay for performance plans and things like that.

372
00:15:37,295 --> 00:15:42,177
The mean outcomes for teams that did use individually tailored incentives

373
00:15:42,177 --> 00:15:46,039
was 63.2 versus 56.5 for teams that did not.

374
00:15:46,819 --> 00:15:51,421
Again, we used Wilcoxon rank sum test for statistical significance and we found a p-value

375
00:15:51,421 --> 00:15:52,301
of .17 for this.

376
00:15:52,301 --> 00:15:56,002
We also found that this effect seemed to drop off for large teams, that is, teams of size

377
00:15:56,002 --> 00:15:57,103
greater than 50.

378
00:15:57,103 --> 00:15:59,484
And we're not sure why this would be the case.

379
00:15:59,484 --> 00:16:03,285
However, it does suggest that if you're going to offer financial incentives to your team,

380
00:16:03,285 --> 00:16:09,087
it's probably a better idea to offer them to specific individuals, to specific tasks

381
00:16:09,087 --> 00:16:14,029
within a limited time frame along the lines of a pay for performance plan rather than

382
00:16:14,029 --> 00:16:15,830
offering royalties or anything like that.

383
00:16:17,513 --> 00:16:20,035
We asked a question about what production methodology a team

384
00:16:20,035 --> 00:16:23,638
used, whether it was waterfall, Agile, Agile using scrum or

385
00:16:23,638 --> 00:16:27,121
other. We also had an option for don't know. And we found that

386
00:16:27,121 --> 00:16:29,984
there was essentially no statistically significant

387
00:16:29,984 --> 00:16:33,086
difference. Waterfall seems slightly lower in this image but

388
00:16:33,086 --> 00:16:35,849
it's not statistically significant. So this is a very

389
00:16:35,849 --> 00:16:38,591
surprising result. Advocates for Agile and scrum in particular

390
00:16:38,591 --> 00:16:41,594
seem to often treat it as a holy grail and we spend a ton of time

391
00:16:41,594 --> 00:16:43,315
talking about methodologies at GDC.

392
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:46,967
But our results really make you scratch your head.

393
00:16:46,967 --> 00:16:49,730
If Agile and Scrum really are such holy grails,

394
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:52,352
why don't we see a difference in outcomes?

395
00:16:52,352 --> 00:16:54,254
Here's another way of looking at the same data.

396
00:16:54,254 --> 00:16:59,038
Each of the colored dots is a single team in our survey.

397
00:16:59,038 --> 00:17:02,962
The orange teams used Waterfall, the green teams used Agile,

398
00:17:02,962 --> 00:17:04,823
the red dots used Agile with Scrum,

399
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:07,206
the purple dots used Other, and the blue dots

400
00:17:07,206 --> 00:17:08,086
answered I don't know.

401
00:17:08,086 --> 00:17:10,188
So do you see the pattern here?

402
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:13,771
No, because there is no pattern, right?

403
00:17:13,771 --> 00:17:14,831
Obviously trick question.

404
00:17:14,831 --> 00:17:16,912
So you'll notice that all of the lines, the orange line,

405
00:17:16,912 --> 00:17:18,612
the purple line, the red line, the green line,

406
00:17:18,612 --> 00:17:19,793
are almost coincidence.

407
00:17:19,793 --> 00:17:24,454
And that is Waterfall, Scrum, Agile, and Other.

408
00:17:24,454 --> 00:17:28,095
And they are almost identical in terms of their outcomes.

409
00:17:28,095 --> 00:17:29,436
You'll notice that the blue line, which

410
00:17:29,436 --> 00:17:30,476
is the people who answered, I don't

411
00:17:30,476 --> 00:17:33,197
know what our team's production methodology is,

412
00:17:33,197 --> 00:17:35,518
which clearly indicates that there were serious production

413
00:17:35,518 --> 00:17:36,138
issues on that team.

414
00:17:36,396 --> 00:17:39,858
that plummets pretty hard after a team size of five.

415
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:42,480
The horizontal axis here is the size of the team.

416
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,361
So I want to be clear that I'm not saying

417
00:17:44,361 --> 00:17:46,582
that production is pointless.

418
00:17:46,582 --> 00:17:48,744
I'm not saying that it's important, only that it

419
00:17:48,744 --> 00:17:52,246
probably has the effectiveness of production probably

420
00:17:52,246 --> 00:17:55,468
has a lot more to do with how you do your production, how

421
00:17:55,468 --> 00:17:58,030
you fit it to your team, rather than whether you're

422
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:00,091
using Agile, Waterfall, or anything else.

423
00:18:01,888 --> 00:18:03,610
We also looked at team experience levels.

424
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:05,332
We asked a question early in the survey

425
00:18:05,332 --> 00:18:06,853
about the average level of experience

426
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:08,695
on the team in terms of the number of years,

427
00:18:08,695 --> 00:18:10,778
and then measured statistical significance

428
00:18:10,778 --> 00:18:11,839
using a Kruskal-Wallis test.

429
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,121
And as you can see, there's a real progression here,

430
00:18:14,121 --> 00:18:16,484
especially as you move from four to five years, which

431
00:18:16,484 --> 00:18:18,626
is the middle column, to six or seven years, which

432
00:18:18,626 --> 00:18:21,249
is the fourth column, outcomes start to get a lot higher.

433
00:18:21,959 --> 00:18:25,622
Notice how in particular for teams with eight or more years of experience, not only is the

434
00:18:25,622 --> 00:18:29,907
average much higher, but none of the aggregate outcome scores are below 45.

435
00:18:29,907 --> 00:18:34,232
That lower right-hand corner is almost completely empty.

436
00:18:34,232 --> 00:18:37,155
Teams with an average of eight or more years of experience.

437
00:18:37,901 --> 00:18:40,062
clearly don't fail nearly as much, right?

438
00:18:40,062 --> 00:18:43,064
That doesn't necessarily prove that the experience caused

439
00:18:43,064 --> 00:18:43,664
the better outcomes.

440
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,705
It could simply mean that to a large extent,

441
00:18:45,705 --> 00:18:47,666
more experienced developers are attracted

442
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:50,307
to teams that have historically been more successful,

443
00:18:50,307 --> 00:18:52,428
and their experience makes them more likely to be

444
00:18:52,428 --> 00:18:53,869
hired by those teams.

445
00:18:53,869 --> 00:18:56,750
But either way, experience clearly does matter.

446
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:00,292
We asked a question about what technology solution

447
00:19:00,292 --> 00:19:01,693
the team used to build its game.

448
00:19:01,693 --> 00:19:04,794
From top to bottom, the rows are top row, new engine

449
00:19:04,794 --> 00:19:05,775
or technology solution.

450
00:19:09,006 --> 00:19:12,689
Second row, internal or proprietary engine or technology,

451
00:19:12,689 --> 00:19:13,910
such as EA Frostbite.

452
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:18,033
The third row was external or licensed engine or technology,

453
00:19:18,033 --> 00:19:20,335
such as Unity or Unreal or Crytek.

454
00:19:20,335 --> 00:19:22,316
The fourth row was a technology or engine

455
00:19:22,316 --> 00:19:24,258
from previous version of the same game

456
00:19:24,258 --> 00:19:26,259
or a similar game in the series.

457
00:19:26,259 --> 00:19:27,560
And the bottom row was other.

458
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,762
And what we found was that none of these

459
00:19:29,762 --> 00:19:32,644
really had any statistically significant correlation

460
00:19:32,644 --> 00:19:35,526
with the project outcome, except for the fourth column, which

461
00:19:35,526 --> 00:19:37,428
is the engine for a sequel.

462
00:19:37,869 --> 00:19:39,530
based on the previous game's engine.

463
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:41,992
And when you think about it, that shouldn't be even a little

464
00:19:41,992 --> 00:19:45,355
bit surprising, because if you are making a sequel to a game,

465
00:19:45,355 --> 00:19:47,958
obviously, first of all, the first game was successful, you

466
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:50,720
know what the game is, you know what your market is, you know

467
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,723
how to identify your market, you already have a technology base

468
00:19:53,723 --> 00:19:56,586
that you used to build the engine the first time, you

469
00:19:56,586 --> 00:19:59,528
probably have the same team that worked with the engine and they

470
00:19:59,528 --> 00:20:02,992
already know how to use it for this type of game. So there are

471
00:20:02,992 --> 00:20:04,233
a whole lot of advantages.

472
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,240
in that particular case.

473
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,042
So it's really no surprising that those teams showed

474
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:15,224
much higher aggregate and statistically significantly

475
00:20:15,224 --> 00:20:15,864
higher aggregate outcomes.

476
00:20:15,864 --> 00:20:16,524
Let's talk about crunch.

477
00:20:16,524 --> 00:20:19,426
There's an attitude among many developers

478
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:23,067
that crunch is a necessary part of any good game development

479
00:20:23,067 --> 00:20:23,327
project.

480
00:20:23,327 --> 00:20:25,428
There's a quote from an interview

481
00:20:25,428 --> 00:20:27,649
with a certain veteran game developer

482
00:20:27,649 --> 00:20:29,450
that sums up this attitude.

483
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:31,790
Crunch will always exist in studios

484
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:32,991
that strive for quality.

485
00:20:34,337 --> 00:20:37,618
And a large percentage of our industry shares this view.

486
00:20:37,618 --> 00:20:40,439
And I want to point out that the implicit assumption here

487
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:42,920
is that extraordinary results can only

488
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:47,242
come from extraordinary effort, and that extraordinary effort

489
00:20:47,242 --> 00:20:51,244
necessarily implies extraordinary overtime.

490
00:20:51,244 --> 00:20:52,784
Now, I think most of us are aware

491
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:55,506
of the data of the harmful effects of extended overtime

492
00:20:55,506 --> 00:20:56,266
on individuals.

493
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,042
There's tons of data clearly illustrating

494
00:20:59,042 --> 00:21:00,443
that the abuse of overtime not only

495
00:21:00,443 --> 00:21:02,904
leads to lower total productivity,

496
00:21:02,904 --> 00:21:04,726
not only drives a lot of talented people out

497
00:21:04,726 --> 00:21:07,888
of our industry, but it leads to a higher risk of relationship

498
00:21:07,888 --> 00:21:11,291
failure, mental illness, alcohol abuse, depression,

499
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:12,572
and a host of other problems.

500
00:21:12,572 --> 00:21:14,633
I think many of us are also probably aware

501
00:21:14,633 --> 00:21:17,155
of the recent findings that pulling all-nighters

502
00:21:17,155 --> 00:21:18,336
causes permanent brain damage.

503
00:21:18,336 --> 00:21:19,797
And outside the game industry, it's

504
00:21:19,797 --> 00:21:24,200
generally accepted that overtime abuse is a bad idea.

505
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,762
And the practice of crunch is relatively rare.

506
00:21:27,982 --> 00:21:30,324
But there's an implicit assumption here, first of all,

507
00:21:30,324 --> 00:21:34,708
that crunch actually improves the quality of the game.

508
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,029
But how do we know that's true?

509
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:38,311
And sure, I know a lot of you are probably

510
00:21:38,311 --> 00:21:40,493
looking at me like I'm crazy and thinking, hey, wait a minute.

511
00:21:40,493 --> 00:21:42,295
On my last game, we crunched 80 hours a week.

512
00:21:42,295 --> 00:21:45,218
We never would have finished it if we hadn't crunched.

513
00:21:45,218 --> 00:21:46,139
And yeah, maybe that's true.

514
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:50,022
And sure, there have been quite a few undeniably great games

515
00:21:50,022 --> 00:21:50,763
made with crunch.

516
00:21:52,161 --> 00:21:54,622
But I also know a lady who chain-smoked and lived to 95.

517
00:21:54,622 --> 00:21:57,803
Can we say that because she was chain-smoking,

518
00:21:57,803 --> 00:22:00,464
the chain-smoking caused her enhanced longevity?

519
00:22:00,464 --> 00:22:02,825
Or should we look at the broader data

520
00:22:02,825 --> 00:22:04,166
and say, OK, putting it in perspective,

521
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:06,267
that lady is an extreme outlier.

522
00:22:06,267 --> 00:22:09,008
It actually takes seven years off your life on average.

523
00:22:09,008 --> 00:22:12,609
And how can we know for sure that that lady wouldn't

524
00:22:12,609 --> 00:22:15,410
have lived to 112 if she hadn't been a chain-smoker?

525
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:18,792
And similarly, if you ship a great game

526
00:22:18,792 --> 00:22:20,032
and you crunch to make it.

527
00:22:20,795 --> 00:22:23,796
Do you really want to give crunch all the credit for that?

528
00:22:23,796 --> 00:22:26,338
Can you really say our game was great because of the crunch?

529
00:22:26,338 --> 00:22:28,719
How can you be sure it wouldn't have been even better

530
00:22:28,719 --> 00:22:29,579
if you hadn't?

531
00:22:29,579 --> 00:22:32,281
You don't have a time machine any more than I do.

532
00:22:32,281 --> 00:22:35,763
You can't go back in time and rerun that experiment

533
00:22:35,763 --> 00:22:38,684
to see how it would have turned out if you'd made

534
00:22:38,684 --> 00:22:40,345
slightly different decisions.

535
00:22:40,345 --> 00:22:41,806
So I want to ask, is there really

536
00:22:41,806 --> 00:22:44,708
a solid link in the aggregate between more

537
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:46,229
crunch and better outcomes?

538
00:22:46,229 --> 00:22:49,310
Or are we just assuming the crunch works?

539
00:22:49,647 --> 00:22:52,447
without any real aggregate data to back it up.

540
00:22:52,447 --> 00:22:54,588
We asked a total of five questions relating

541
00:22:54,588 --> 00:22:56,369
to crunch in our survey.

542
00:22:56,369 --> 00:23:00,070
Two of those questions related to the overall amount

543
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,670
of crunch the teams engaged in.

544
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:05,371
The three bars in this graph show all of our 273 samples

545
00:23:05,371 --> 00:23:07,952
grouped into three categories.

546
00:23:07,952 --> 00:23:09,673
The bar on the left shows the 25%

547
00:23:09,673 --> 00:23:12,433
of teams that engaged in the least amount of crunch.

548
00:23:13,276 --> 00:23:14,477
The bar on the right shows the 25%

549
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:17,518
of teams that engaged in the greatest amount of crunch.

550
00:23:17,518 --> 00:23:20,320
And the bar in the middle is the central 50%

551
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,761
of teams that did a medium amount of crunch.

552
00:23:22,761 --> 00:23:25,803
And the vertical axis is aggregate outcome score,

553
00:23:25,803 --> 00:23:27,844
with the top of the scale, as before,

554
00:23:27,844 --> 00:23:30,865
representing teams with the most strongly positive outcomes.

555
00:23:30,865 --> 00:23:31,466
So that makes you wonder.

556
00:23:34,733 --> 00:23:37,214
If crunch is a necessary precondition for quality,

557
00:23:37,214 --> 00:23:39,315
how do you explain the green dots on the top left?

558
00:23:39,315 --> 00:23:42,376
We're looking at a whole lot of successful teams there,

559
00:23:42,376 --> 00:23:45,457
and they achieved their success with the least amount of crunch.

560
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:47,497
In fact, the group with the least crunch

561
00:23:47,497 --> 00:23:49,738
had the greatest number of project

562
00:23:49,738 --> 00:23:52,559
with positive outcomes of all three groups.

563
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,500
I'm sure the three data points inside that box

564
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,960
all strive for quality.

565
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,821
And yet, they didn't crunch very much, if at all.

566
00:23:58,821 --> 00:24:02,162
So how did they manage to achieve success?

567
00:24:02,162 --> 00:24:03,962
And similarly, take a look at the lower right.

568
00:24:04,525 --> 00:24:07,246
We see a whole lot of red dots toward the bottom showing teams

569
00:24:07,246 --> 00:24:10,447
that experienced very poor outcomes despite doing more

570
00:24:10,447 --> 00:24:13,629
crunch than anybody else. In fact, most of the teams that

571
00:24:13,629 --> 00:24:16,850
experienced poor outcomes used the greatest amount of crunch.

572
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:19,871
Let's dive in a little deeper. Among the teams that did the

573
00:24:19,871 --> 00:24:23,372
most crunch on the right column, there were 71 data points with

574
00:24:23,372 --> 00:24:24,933
an average outcome score of 48.

575
00:24:25,813 --> 00:24:30,617
The middle 50% of boxes in this category, that is the dots inside the gray boxes in

576
00:24:30,617 --> 00:24:34,940
the vertical box and whisker plot, had outcome scores between 34 and 63.

577
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,382
Now let's look at the bar on the left.

578
00:24:36,382 --> 00:24:40,445
These are the 25% of teams that did the least amount of crunch.

579
00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:44,008
Here we have 64 data points with an average outcome score of 62.

580
00:24:44,008 --> 00:24:51,874
The middle 50% of those samples, again the ones inside the gray boxes, had outcome scores

581
00:24:51,874 --> 00:24:52,895
between 51 and 74.

582
00:24:55,095 --> 00:24:58,357
So you may be looking at that and saying, okay, well, that's

583
00:24:58,357 --> 00:25:01,819
nice, but what about when crunch is voluntary? I mean, hey, look

584
00:25:01,819 --> 00:25:05,301
at me, I'm doing overtime because I'm passionate about the

585
00:25:05,301 --> 00:25:08,963
product, not because I have a boss holding the gun to my head,

586
00:25:08,963 --> 00:25:11,105
right? So now let's look at solely voluntary crunch. We had

587
00:25:11,105 --> 00:25:14,347
two questions on our survey asking whether any crunch done

588
00:25:14,347 --> 00:25:18,049
on the project was voluntary or mandatory, regardless of how

589
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:22,351
much crunch actually occurred. The left column is the mandatory

590
00:25:22,351 --> 00:25:22,772
crunch group.

591
00:25:23,602 --> 00:25:26,164
The right column is the voluntary crunch group.

592
00:25:26,164 --> 00:25:28,226
And just as before, the middle bar

593
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:29,267
is the middle 50% of teams.

594
00:25:29,267 --> 00:25:33,630
Here we see a very strong and statistically significant

595
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:34,851
correlation.

596
00:25:34,851 --> 00:25:36,953
The teams that reported that crunch was mandatory

597
00:25:36,953 --> 00:25:40,296
were far more likely to report low outcomes.

598
00:25:40,296 --> 00:25:42,718
And the teams that reported that any crunch was voluntary

599
00:25:42,718 --> 00:25:44,500
were far more likely to report positive outcomes.

600
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,421
So in the 25% most mandatory crunch group.

601
00:25:50,938 --> 00:25:54,260
60 data points in that bar, the average outcome score was 49.

602
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,822
50% of them were between 34 and 63.

603
00:25:56,822 --> 00:25:59,905
In the group with the 25% most voluntary,

604
00:25:59,905 --> 00:26:05,729
there was 71 data points with an average outcome score of 67.

605
00:26:05,729 --> 00:26:09,432
50% of those were between 54 and 80.

606
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:16,902
Here's a graph, a little table, showing all the data sorted by how much crunch they did

607
00:26:16,902 --> 00:26:19,142
and whether that crunch was voluntary or mandatory.

608
00:26:19,142 --> 00:26:23,903
So you can see the horizontal axis, left side is voluntary, right side is mandatory.

609
00:26:23,903 --> 00:26:29,145
Top row is the most crunch, the bottom row is the least amount of crunch.

610
00:26:29,145 --> 00:26:30,645
Now look at the upper right corner.

611
00:26:30,645 --> 00:26:37,207
The teams that were in the 25 percent quartile of saying the crunch was the most mandatory

612
00:26:37,207 --> 00:26:39,367
and that also did the most amount of crunch.

613
00:26:39,677 --> 00:26:43,139
had a median outcome score of 39.84. In the lower left, you

614
00:26:43,139 --> 00:26:46,500
notice the little green box with a value of 70.62. This is the

615
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:51,863
teams that were simultaneously reporting that they were in the

616
00:26:51,863 --> 00:26:56,525
most voluntary quartile and the least amount of crunch quartile.

617
00:26:56,525 --> 00:26:59,947
Now, let's say you're coming into the industry for the first

618
00:26:59,947 --> 00:27:02,228
time. You don't have any preconceived notions about

619
00:27:02,228 --> 00:27:05,369
crunch at all. Maybe you don't even know what crunch even is,

620
00:27:05,369 --> 00:27:08,711
right? Which of these groups would you want to be in?

621
00:27:12,252 --> 00:27:14,213
Now, you may be looking at this and saying, wait, hold on a

622
00:27:14,213 --> 00:27:17,776
second, Paul, this is all BS. You're picking up a spurious

623
00:27:17,776 --> 00:27:20,837
correlation. All you're really picking up is whether teams are

624
00:27:20,837 --> 00:27:24,259
experiencing problems. Because everyone knows the teams that

625
00:27:24,259 --> 00:27:27,581
are experiencing problems are more likely to try to use crunch

626
00:27:27,581 --> 00:27:30,943
to solve them. And that's true. I've certainly known teams that

627
00:27:30,943 --> 00:27:33,265
were just dedicated to crunch no matter what because they thought

628
00:27:33,265 --> 00:27:35,366
it worked. But, yeah, there are definitely a lot of teams that

629
00:27:35,366 --> 00:27:37,908
say, hey, we're now having problems, let's crunch. And

630
00:27:37,908 --> 00:27:40,209
that's how we will try and dig ourselves out of this hole.

631
00:27:41,165 --> 00:27:43,846
So we're going to refer to this as the crunch salvage

632
00:27:43,846 --> 00:27:47,847
hypothesis, which is crunch is more likely to occur

633
00:27:47,847 --> 00:27:51,427
on projects that are already in trouble.

634
00:27:51,427 --> 00:27:53,168
And these results are just picking up

635
00:27:53,168 --> 00:27:54,528
that underlying correlation.

636
00:27:54,528 --> 00:27:57,229
So here's what we did to try to tease out

637
00:27:57,229 --> 00:28:00,049
whether that was actually what was going on.

638
00:28:00,049 --> 00:28:02,270
We built a predictive model based

639
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:05,650
on a linear regression for all of the cultural factors

640
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:06,431
in our entire study.

641
00:28:06,431 --> 00:28:08,351
And we found that there were 30 of them

642
00:28:08,351 --> 00:28:10,131
that we could use.

643
00:28:10,997 --> 00:28:13,019
put them into a linear regression,

644
00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:16,022
and build a linear regression that had a correlation of 0.82

645
00:28:16,022 --> 00:28:19,244
with the aggregate outcome score.

646
00:28:19,244 --> 00:28:22,527
That is an incredibly high correlation.

647
00:28:22,527 --> 00:28:24,989
And the p-value here was incredibly close to zero.

648
00:28:24,989 --> 00:28:28,733
So we could predict with a very high degree of accuracy

649
00:28:28,733 --> 00:28:30,894
what a team's aggregate outcome was going to be.

650
00:28:32,223 --> 00:28:34,705
based on those 30 cultural factors.

651
00:28:34,705 --> 00:28:39,388
Then what we did was we took that same linear regression

652
00:28:39,388 --> 00:28:41,810
and we removed all the questions related to crunch.

653
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:46,394
This lowered the correlation from 0.82 to 0.81.

654
00:28:46,394 --> 00:28:50,597
So you'll notice here in the upper left side, culture,

655
00:28:50,597 --> 00:28:53,079
teamwork, and production factors excluding crunch.

656
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:55,401
That was what went into the crunch-free model.

657
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:58,784
So based on that, we were able to look at every team

658
00:28:58,784 --> 00:29:00,925
and say, OK, what would?

659
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:06,163
the crunch-free model predict the aggregate outcome score would be.

660
00:29:06,163 --> 00:29:09,124
And then we could ask, how much did they crunch,

661
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:12,866
and what is the difference between their actual outcome

662
00:29:12,866 --> 00:29:15,547
and the model that our linear regression reported?

663
00:29:15,547 --> 00:29:18,889
In other words, how much lift did crunch give them

664
00:29:18,889 --> 00:29:22,391
beyond what this very powerful linear regression model reported?

665
00:29:22,391 --> 00:29:24,532
And here's what we got.

666
00:29:24,532 --> 00:29:27,793
Here's the same chart with the same categories.

667
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:35,737
Instead of showing the actual outcome score, we're just showing the lift that these teams seem to experience from added crunch.

668
00:29:35,737 --> 00:29:40,720
And again, note that this is a 0 to 100 scale for outcome scores, right?

669
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,102
So a value of 3 or 4 is tiny. It's almost insignificant here.

670
00:29:45,102 --> 00:29:50,585
You'll notice in the upper right, the teams that were in the most mandatory quartile and the most crunch quartile...

671
00:29:52,049 --> 00:29:57,931
had scores that were 3.91 at outcome points lower than the

672
00:29:57,931 --> 00:30:01,352
crunch free model would have predicted. And in the lower left

673
00:30:01,352 --> 00:30:04,793
corner, the teams that were both in the most voluntary quartile

674
00:30:04,793 --> 00:30:09,615
and the least amount of crunch quartile had aggregate outcome

675
00:30:09,615 --> 00:30:13,396
scores 3.17 points higher than you would have predicted. So

676
00:30:13,396 --> 00:30:19,399
this suggests that maybe crunch actually has a minimal effect on

677
00:30:19,399 --> 00:30:20,899
the outcome of your project.

678
00:30:21,407 --> 00:30:25,170
Another way of putting it is your studio's culture probably

679
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:27,431
already dictates most of the outcome.

680
00:30:27,431 --> 00:30:29,493
And crunching really isn't going to change that.

681
00:30:29,493 --> 00:30:31,914
I want to be clear that we didn't set out

682
00:30:31,914 --> 00:30:34,856
with any preconceived notions or trying to prove anything.

683
00:30:34,856 --> 00:30:37,598
We just followed where the data led us with an open mind.

684
00:30:37,598 --> 00:30:40,240
But the data spoke very strongly on this.

685
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,622
Now you might be saying, hey, my team crunched

686
00:30:42,622 --> 00:30:43,803
and our game turned out great.

687
00:30:43,803 --> 00:30:44,883
And that's true.

688
00:30:44,883 --> 00:30:47,705
Some projects do a lot of crunch and they turn out just fine.

689
00:30:48,407 --> 00:30:51,612
But I have to ask, do we crunch because it works,

690
00:30:51,612 --> 00:30:53,535
or do we do it because we believe it works?

691
00:30:53,535 --> 00:30:56,781
A single data point is meaningless on its own.

692
00:30:56,781 --> 00:30:58,483
Remember the 95-year-old chain smoker.

693
00:30:58,483 --> 00:30:59,785
There's no way to tell unless you

694
00:30:59,785 --> 00:31:02,830
do a thorough statistical analysis on a large data set.

695
00:31:03,481 --> 00:31:05,922
And all of us in this room have different opinions on crunch.

696
00:31:05,922 --> 00:31:07,342
All of us have different experiences.

697
00:31:07,342 --> 00:31:09,143
And if we go by who's an expert or who's

698
00:31:09,143 --> 00:31:11,464
got the most experience, we'll still just end up

699
00:31:11,464 --> 00:31:12,664
with a room full of arguing.

700
00:31:12,664 --> 00:31:15,285
Because any position you can take on an issue like this,

701
00:31:15,285 --> 00:31:17,206
I can find an equally qualified person

702
00:31:17,206 --> 00:31:19,807
on the other end of the spectrum to argue the other side.

703
00:31:20,663 --> 00:31:26,584
There are a couple of potential weaknesses with our findings on crunch. One is that it doesn't precisely define what crunch is.

704
00:31:26,584 --> 00:31:31,065
We were not able to nail down, here's how many hours a week constitute crunch.

705
00:31:31,065 --> 00:31:34,886
It doesn't nail down the point of diminishing returns for overtime.

706
00:31:34,886 --> 00:31:39,807
In this next version of the study later this year, we're going to try to quantify that.

707
00:31:39,807 --> 00:31:45,889
But my challenge to you, if you disagree, is to prove me wrong, but prove me wrong with data.

708
00:31:45,889 --> 00:31:48,970
Nothing else is going to convince me.

709
00:31:50,386 --> 00:31:52,688
Let's talk about culture.

710
00:31:52,688 --> 00:31:59,592
And this is where we saw the really strong correlations

711
00:31:59,592 --> 00:32:00,833
in our study.

712
00:32:00,833 --> 00:32:06,617
So in order to be able to measure culture and analyze it

713
00:32:06,617 --> 00:32:09,519
systematically and quantitatively,

714
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:12,001
we need some sort of conceptual model for it.

715
00:32:12,001 --> 00:32:13,962
And we throw around a lot of words in the industry,

716
00:32:13,962 --> 00:32:15,584
like teamwork and culture.

717
00:32:15,584 --> 00:32:18,025
But those are all very big and wishy-washy words.

718
00:32:18,736 --> 00:32:21,717
We need to nail down exactly what we mean by good teamwork

719
00:32:21,717 --> 00:32:26,160
or bad teamwork, or how one studio's culture differs

720
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:29,281
from another studio's culture on a very precise level.

721
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:31,042
And this is important.

722
00:32:31,042 --> 00:32:32,903
You can't debug computer code unless you

723
00:32:32,903 --> 00:32:34,684
understand the programming language it's written in.

724
00:32:34,684 --> 00:32:37,805
And similarly, you can't debug your team

725
00:32:37,805 --> 00:32:40,767
unless you really understand the language of good teams.

726
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:47,041
Just to give you an example of a conceptual model

727
00:32:47,041 --> 00:32:48,642
for effective teams, I know some managers

728
00:32:48,642 --> 00:32:51,825
who try to use Freudian psychoanalysis as a management

729
00:32:51,825 --> 00:32:52,185
tool.

730
00:32:52,185 --> 00:32:54,387
And that is not the right tool for the job.

731
00:32:54,387 --> 00:32:56,609
If you're playing armchair psychiatrist

732
00:32:56,609 --> 00:32:59,451
with your employees, you're not going to fix anything.

733
00:32:59,451 --> 00:33:01,412
You're not going to understand your employees,

734
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:03,054
and you're really just going to tick them off.

735
00:33:03,054 --> 00:33:05,656
And you're probably going to make a dysfunctional team even

736
00:33:05,656 --> 00:33:05,916
worse.

737
00:33:05,916 --> 00:33:09,138
So it's very important to have the right conceptual model

738
00:33:09,138 --> 00:33:09,879
of effective teams.

739
00:33:10,974 --> 00:33:15,316
Back in 2009 through 2012, I got an MSE degree in technology

740
00:33:15,316 --> 00:33:18,177
management from University of Pennsylvania in the Wharton

741
00:33:18,177 --> 00:33:18,337
School.

742
00:33:18,337 --> 00:33:21,959
And as part of that, I studied organizational behavior

743
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:24,581
and design under Adam Grant, the top-rated professor

744
00:33:24,581 --> 00:33:26,062
at the Wharton School.

745
00:33:26,062 --> 00:33:29,023
And in that class, they taught a scientifically validated model

746
00:33:29,023 --> 00:33:31,004
for team effectiveness that you can

747
00:33:31,004 --> 00:33:34,326
use to analyze and diagnose any team in any industry.

748
00:33:34,326 --> 00:33:36,487
And I found that really fascinating

749
00:33:36,487 --> 00:33:39,048
because I'd never realized there was such a thing before.

750
00:33:39,452 --> 00:33:41,553
or that there was such a thing as a model of team

751
00:33:41,553 --> 00:33:44,314
effectiveness, or they could be scientifically validated.

752
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:46,874
And it put all of my own experiences in the game industry

753
00:33:46,874 --> 00:33:49,215
into an incredible perspective.

754
00:33:49,215 --> 00:33:51,236
And I started to look back on my own past experiences

755
00:33:51,236 --> 00:33:54,637
and see how so many of the teams that I had worked with

756
00:33:54,637 --> 00:33:57,818
had different cultures that correlated dramatically

757
00:33:57,818 --> 00:33:59,778
with the results they actually achieved.

758
00:33:59,778 --> 00:34:00,799
The Wharton effectiveness model is

759
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:04,200
based on the book Leading Teams, Setting

760
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,701
the Stage for Great Performances by J. Richard Hackman.

761
00:34:08,565 --> 00:34:12,108
So we decided to use Hackman's model as one of the foundations of our survey.

762
00:34:12,108 --> 00:34:13,929
Here's Hackman's model in a nutshell.

763
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:14,470
Number one, real team.

764
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:19,914
This means there have to be clear team boundaries, who's in the team, who isn't.

765
00:34:19,914 --> 00:34:22,836
Team members have to have clear authority over their own tasks.

766
00:34:22,836 --> 00:34:26,620
They have to be able to build those tasks themselves, not have them handed to them from

767
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:27,220
on high.

768
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:28,921
The team composition has to be...

769
00:34:29,554 --> 00:34:31,434
based on diverse skills.

770
00:34:31,434 --> 00:34:33,235
There has to be stable membership.

771
00:34:33,235 --> 00:34:35,735
If people are constantly coming and going,

772
00:34:35,735 --> 00:34:36,635
it's not a real team.

773
00:34:36,635 --> 00:34:39,976
Number two, there has to be a compelling direction,

774
00:34:39,976 --> 00:34:42,596
a clear motivating goal that guides and motivates

775
00:34:42,596 --> 00:34:44,017
the team's efforts.

776
00:34:44,017 --> 00:34:46,037
Number three, enabling structure.

777
00:34:46,037 --> 00:34:48,617
Tasks, roles, and responsibilities

778
00:34:48,617 --> 00:34:50,498
have to be clearly specified and designed

779
00:34:50,498 --> 00:34:51,618
for individual members.

780
00:34:51,618 --> 00:34:54,358
And there has to be a clear definition of who is

781
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:55,259
and who isn't on the team.

782
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,919
Number four, supportive context.

783
00:34:58,668 --> 00:35:04,172
This means there should be incentives encouraging the desired behaviors and discouraging the unwanted ones.

784
00:35:04,172 --> 00:35:08,235
There should be tools and affordances to get the job done.

785
00:35:08,235 --> 00:35:13,579
And team members need to have a level of psychological safety that they can raise the red flag,

786
00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:15,801
call out when the ship is about to hit an iceberg,

787
00:35:15,801 --> 00:35:19,384
and know that they're going to be listened to and not politically punished for that.

788
00:35:20,604 --> 00:35:23,207
Finally, they have to have access to expert coaching.

789
00:35:23,207 --> 00:35:26,550
This means motivators, consultants, and educators

790
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:28,672
outside the boundaries of the team who can

791
00:35:28,672 --> 00:35:30,033
help them raise their game.

792
00:35:30,033 --> 00:35:31,234
In addition to that, we also looked at the model

793
00:35:31,234 --> 00:35:36,058
described in the book The Five Dysfunctions of a Team

794
00:35:36,058 --> 00:35:37,339
by Patrick Lencioni.

795
00:35:37,339 --> 00:35:39,521
This book describes a very different model,

796
00:35:39,521 --> 00:35:41,383
and it describes how things typically go

797
00:35:41,383 --> 00:35:42,664
wrong with the team's culture.

798
00:35:42,664 --> 00:35:44,346
But rather than explaining it this way,

799
00:35:44,346 --> 00:35:45,767
I'm going to use Yoda to help me out.

800
00:35:47,128 --> 00:35:49,889
It starts with a lack of trust between team members, which

801
00:35:49,889 --> 00:35:51,729
leads to a fear of conflict because nobody

802
00:35:51,729 --> 00:35:53,470
trusts anybody else and nobody feels

803
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:54,930
like they can speak out safely.

804
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:57,490
This leads to a lack of commitment

805
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:59,791
because nobody feels engaged with the project.

806
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:02,131
The lack of commitment leads to an avoidance

807
00:36:02,131 --> 00:36:04,772
of accountability, this leads to an inattention to results,

808
00:36:04,772 --> 00:36:08,093
and a disconnect between the team's perception of itself

809
00:36:08,093 --> 00:36:09,693
and the results they're actually getting.

810
00:36:09,693 --> 00:36:11,733
And that leads to games that don't

811
00:36:11,733 --> 00:36:12,793
live up to their potential.

812
00:36:13,694 --> 00:36:15,456
And that leads to hate, hate leads to anger,

813
00:36:15,456 --> 00:36:16,537
anger leads to the dark side.

814
00:36:16,537 --> 00:36:17,377
You know how it all goes.

815
00:36:17,377 --> 00:36:20,380
So what's nice about these two models

816
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:23,042
is they're essentially orthogonal to each other.

817
00:36:23,042 --> 00:36:25,244
For the most part, the Wharton School model,

818
00:36:25,244 --> 00:36:28,367
that is the Hackman model, describes external factors,

819
00:36:28,367 --> 00:36:31,169
structural factors, context, how to set up

820
00:36:31,169 --> 00:36:33,731
the right environment for a team to really excel.

821
00:36:34,524 --> 00:36:37,566
Whereas the five dysfunctions model, the Lencioni model,

822
00:36:37,566 --> 00:36:39,827
describes the internal dynamics of a team

823
00:36:39,827 --> 00:36:42,509
and how those internal relationships can go awry

824
00:36:42,509 --> 00:36:44,610
and what to do to fix them when that happens.

825
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:47,751
I'm going to refer to these as the Hackman model on the left

826
00:36:47,751 --> 00:36:49,833
and the Lencioni model on the right.

827
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:50,573
So here's what we found.

828
00:36:50,573 --> 00:36:52,254
And yes, there's a lot of numbers on here.

829
00:36:52,254 --> 00:36:53,995
But before you freak out, I promise

830
00:36:53,995 --> 00:36:55,956
I'm not actually going to show the numbers this way.

831
00:36:55,956 --> 00:36:57,977
These are all in the articles on GammaCetera

832
00:36:57,977 --> 00:36:59,038
if you want to read them there.

833
00:36:59,038 --> 00:37:02,480
I'm going to give you a very different view of the data.

834
00:37:02,931 --> 00:37:04,332
Really quickly, on the left side,

835
00:37:04,332 --> 00:37:06,053
we have five of the questions that we

836
00:37:06,053 --> 00:37:11,317
asked with this particular aspect of the Hackman model.

837
00:37:11,317 --> 00:37:13,118
Along the top, we show the correlations

838
00:37:13,118 --> 00:37:16,540
with project delays, ROI, Metacritic, internal goals,

839
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:19,742
all the various outcome factors, as well as the aggregate

840
00:37:19,742 --> 00:37:21,123
outcome score.

841
00:37:21,123 --> 00:37:22,404
But numbers are boring.

842
00:37:22,404 --> 00:37:25,206
And rather than showing a whole bunch of correlation values,

843
00:37:25,206 --> 00:37:27,708
what I'd like to do is show you the actual responses

844
00:37:27,708 --> 00:37:29,369
from the top teams and the bottom teams.

845
00:37:30,805 --> 00:37:33,507
On this slide we have three of those questions from that

846
00:37:33,507 --> 00:37:36,768
section, I'm sorry, two of those questions from that section.

847
00:37:36,768 --> 00:37:40,210
I've taken just the top 25% of teams from our survey and the

848
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:43,371
bottom 25% of teams as ranked by their aggregate outcome score.

849
00:37:43,371 --> 00:37:48,133
So the blue teams represent, the blue area represents the top

850
00:37:48,133 --> 00:37:50,434
teams, the red represents the bottom teams.

851
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:54,756
We've omitted the middle 50% of teams completely for these

852
00:37:54,756 --> 00:37:56,237
slides that I'm going to show you.

853
00:37:57,215 --> 00:37:58,995
And across the horizontal axis, we

854
00:37:58,995 --> 00:38:01,216
have the level of agreement or disagreement

855
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:04,078
with each question, where agree completely

856
00:38:04,078 --> 00:38:07,119
is all the way on the right, to neutral in the middle,

857
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:09,060
to disagree completely in the lower left.

858
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:12,521
And the vertical axis represents the total count

859
00:38:12,521 --> 00:38:15,603
of responses in that category for either group.

860
00:38:15,603 --> 00:38:16,883
So look at what happens.

861
00:38:16,883 --> 00:38:19,764
The question is, the team composition

862
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:21,645
didn't change during the course of development

863
00:38:21,645 --> 00:38:23,386
other than growing when needed.

864
00:38:24,089 --> 00:38:28,391
Among the top teams in blue, 16 people responded agree

865
00:38:28,391 --> 00:38:32,553
completely, and 17 people said strongly agree.

866
00:38:32,553 --> 00:38:35,234
Among the bottom 25% of teams, only six people

867
00:38:35,234 --> 00:38:37,616
said agree completely to this question,

868
00:38:37,616 --> 00:38:38,976
and 10 said strongly agree.

869
00:38:38,976 --> 00:38:42,178
So the curve has shifted way out to the right.

870
00:38:42,178 --> 00:38:44,719
And you'll see this with almost all of these questions

871
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:48,941
as we go forward, where the top teams agree much more strongly

872
00:38:48,941 --> 00:38:50,201
with positive statements.

873
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:58,867
On the left, the organizational structure and membership of the team were clear from the

874
00:38:58,867 --> 00:39:04,972
outset. 17 people from top teams said agree completely, while only four people from the

875
00:39:04,972 --> 00:39:10,397
bottom 25% of teams said agree completely. And on that same chart, 11 or more people from the

876
00:39:10,397 --> 00:39:15,281
bottom teams said either disagree completely or strongly disagree that the organizational

877
00:39:15,281 --> 00:39:20,325
structure and membership were clear, while among the top teams, exactly five people gave each of

878
00:39:20,325 --> 00:39:21,166
those responses.

879
00:39:22,197 --> 00:39:25,280
On the right side, the team composition

880
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,662
didn't change during the course of development

881
00:39:27,662 --> 00:39:30,144
other than growing when needed.

882
00:39:30,144 --> 00:39:32,887
So second aspect of the Hackman model, compelling direction.

883
00:39:32,887 --> 00:39:35,629
Does the team have a clear motivating goal

884
00:39:35,629 --> 00:39:37,410
that helps focus and guide their efforts?

885
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:41,074
On the left side, the development plan for the game

886
00:39:41,074 --> 00:39:44,116
was clear and well-communicated to the team.

887
00:39:44,116 --> 00:39:46,618
On the right side, the vision for the final version

888
00:39:46,618 --> 00:39:49,381
of the game was clear and well-communicated to the team.

889
00:39:51,037 --> 00:39:53,418
You can see the blue teams agree much more strongly.

890
00:39:53,418 --> 00:39:57,061
The third factor, enabling structure.

891
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,262
Are tasks, roles, and responsibilities

892
00:39:59,262 --> 00:40:02,284
clearly specified and designed for individual members

893
00:40:02,284 --> 00:40:05,206
and properly matched to their individual skills?

894
00:40:09,299 --> 00:40:11,481
Team members' tasks were well-defined and clearly

895
00:40:11,481 --> 00:40:12,121
specified.

896
00:40:12,121 --> 00:40:15,264
On the right side, team members' responsibilities and job roles

897
00:40:15,264 --> 00:40:17,066
were carefully matched with their particular skills

898
00:40:17,066 --> 00:40:17,486
and abilities.

899
00:40:17,486 --> 00:40:19,928
You can see the blue teams in both cases

900
00:40:19,928 --> 00:40:22,211
agree much more strongly with the red teams.

901
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:22,691
Supportive context.

902
00:40:22,691 --> 00:40:27,215
Does the team have the psychological safety

903
00:40:27,215 --> 00:40:29,317
they need to speak openly about problems?

904
00:40:29,317 --> 00:40:32,180
And do they have faith that if they speak up,

905
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,302
you'll take appropriate action and they won't be politically

906
00:40:34,302 --> 00:40:35,203
punished for that?

907
00:40:36,387 --> 00:40:39,490
Do they have incentives encouraging the desired behaviors

908
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:43,372
and disincentivizing the undesirable behaviors?

909
00:40:43,372 --> 00:40:45,514
And do they have the tools and affordances they need

910
00:40:45,514 --> 00:40:47,916
to get their game, to get their jobs done?

911
00:40:47,916 --> 00:40:50,598
So on the left side, we have the question,

912
00:40:50,598 --> 00:40:53,440
mistakes were treated as learning opportunities

913
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,122
or a chance to improve, not a nail in your coffin.

914
00:40:56,122 --> 00:40:59,244
On the right side, we asked people,

915
00:40:59,244 --> 00:41:00,645
personnel issues within the team,

916
00:41:00,645 --> 00:41:02,607
teamwork problems and HR issues,

917
00:41:02,607 --> 00:41:04,528
were dealt with professionally and appropriately.

918
00:41:07,342 --> 00:41:08,063
Expert coaching.

919
00:41:08,063 --> 00:41:09,924
Does the team have access to experts

920
00:41:09,924 --> 00:41:13,546
outside the team's boundaries, including motivators

921
00:41:13,546 --> 00:41:17,829
to help push them forward, consultants to help guide them,

922
00:41:17,829 --> 00:41:19,871
and educators to help improve their skills?

923
00:41:19,871 --> 00:41:22,933
On the left side, you see the team explicitly

924
00:41:22,933 --> 00:41:24,894
attempted to develop team members' skills

925
00:41:24,894 --> 00:41:26,895
or otherwise assist them in their skill development

926
00:41:26,895 --> 00:41:29,377
outside of their normal day-to-day work.

927
00:41:29,377 --> 00:41:31,779
You see the blue teams agree much more strongly with this.

928
00:41:31,779 --> 00:41:34,380
On the right side, we received some form of coaching

929
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,142
or guidance to enhance our efforts.

930
00:41:36,475 --> 00:41:39,958
or improve our effectiveness as team members. Now this is a little interesting because we

931
00:41:39,958 --> 00:41:45,283
can see in this case both the red teams and the blue teams generally disagree with this. So

932
00:41:45,283 --> 00:41:49,426
this is an industry wide pattern. We don't do a lot of training, we don't do a lot of

933
00:41:49,426 --> 00:41:54,511
coaching. It tends to be pretty sink or swim. But still in this case there is a lot more

934
00:41:54,511 --> 00:41:57,233
agreement from the blue teams than the red teams.

935
00:41:59,378 --> 00:42:02,299
We also asked a bunch of questions related to Lencioni's

936
00:42:02,299 --> 00:42:03,739
5 dysfunctions model.

937
00:42:03,739 --> 00:42:05,400
We got very similar correlations here

938
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,861
to the strong correlations we got with the Hackman model.

939
00:42:08,861 --> 00:42:10,961
We asked around 20 questions in this category,

940
00:42:10,961 --> 00:42:12,141
but in the interest of time, I'm only

941
00:42:12,141 --> 00:42:13,622
going to show you three of those.

942
00:42:13,622 --> 00:42:16,362
The first one, it was safe to take a risk on this team

943
00:42:16,362 --> 00:42:20,303
and stick your neck out to say something

944
00:42:20,303 --> 00:42:21,044
that needed to be said.

945
00:42:21,044 --> 00:42:25,085
In the middle, most team members bought into the decisions

946
00:42:25,085 --> 00:42:25,765
that were made.

947
00:42:27,256 --> 00:42:29,877
Now on the right side, we've got a very interesting outlier

948
00:42:29,877 --> 00:42:31,759
because here we've got a question that

949
00:42:31,759 --> 00:42:33,299
was asked in a negative tone.

950
00:42:33,299 --> 00:42:36,001
We're not asking, did the team do something good?

951
00:42:36,001 --> 00:42:38,503
We're asking about something bad that happened on the team.

952
00:42:38,503 --> 00:42:42,785
And as you would expect, here we see red and blue have flipped.

953
00:42:42,785 --> 00:42:44,766
The blue teams are on the left, indicating

954
00:42:44,766 --> 00:42:46,888
much stronger disagreement with this statement.

955
00:42:46,888 --> 00:42:48,388
The red teams are on the right.

956
00:42:48,388 --> 00:42:50,209
So the question is, some team members

957
00:42:50,209 --> 00:42:53,151
put their ego or their own need for recognition

958
00:42:53,151 --> 00:42:55,653
above the collective goals of the game projects.

959
00:42:57,226 --> 00:43:00,067
The blue teams, the top 25% of teams,

960
00:43:00,067 --> 00:43:02,689
strongly disagreed with this in the aggregate.

961
00:43:02,689 --> 00:43:05,150
And the red teams strongly agreed overall.

962
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:06,931
We also used a third book, which is 12,

963
00:43:06,931 --> 00:43:08,812
The Elements of Great Managing.

964
00:43:08,812 --> 00:43:10,833
This book is based on a team effectiveness model

965
00:43:10,833 --> 00:43:13,054
built by Gallup, which is based on thousands of interviews

966
00:43:13,054 --> 00:43:14,435
with teams around the world.

967
00:43:14,435 --> 00:43:16,556
So like the Hackman model used by the Wharton School,

968
00:43:16,556 --> 00:43:18,837
this is a scientifically validated model

969
00:43:18,837 --> 00:43:20,478
for team effectiveness.

970
00:43:20,478 --> 00:43:23,140
Now for the most part, this book is the least useful of the three

971
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:24,400
and I'm not going to spend anything more

972
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,421
than this one slide on it.

973
00:43:26,727 --> 00:43:30,089
because most of its factors are already covered by the Hackman model and the Lencioni model.

974
00:43:30,089 --> 00:43:34,230
But there are five factors I wanted to call out that are unique to this book.

975
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:38,431
A connection with the company's values had a correlation of 0.39.

976
00:43:38,431 --> 00:43:41,372
That's a pretty strong correlation.

977
00:43:41,372 --> 00:43:44,894
Receiving regular, powerful, insightful feedback.

978
00:43:44,894 --> 00:43:48,095
Having peers who are committed to doing quality work.

979
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:49,995
My opinion matters.

980
00:43:49,995 --> 00:43:51,376
And recognition and praise.

981
00:43:56,230 --> 00:43:58,293
We also asked over two dozen questions

982
00:43:58,293 --> 00:44:00,555
regarding other factors, specifically

983
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:01,877
related to game development.

984
00:44:01,877 --> 00:44:05,321
Having a shared vision for the game had a correlation of 0.5.

985
00:44:05,321 --> 00:44:08,685
That's an incredibly strong correlation for anything

986
00:44:08,685 --> 00:44:09,806
in the social sciences.

987
00:44:09,806 --> 00:44:12,189
And that is the single strongest correlation

988
00:44:12,189 --> 00:44:14,892
of any of the questions that we asked in our entire study.

989
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:18,780
Resolving disagreements about the game design, also very

990
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:19,140
strong, 0.45.

991
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:22,941
Justifying and communicating design changes, 0.45.

992
00:44:22,941 --> 00:44:27,082
Celebrating novel ideas, even if they

993
00:44:27,082 --> 00:44:30,283
don't achieve their intended result, 0.38.

994
00:44:30,283 --> 00:44:34,144
A respectful relationship between the management

995
00:44:34,144 --> 00:44:34,424
and the team, 0.36.

996
00:44:34,424 --> 00:44:36,704
So here I want to quickly discuss factors that were not

997
00:44:36,704 --> 00:44:39,605
correlated with outcomes.

998
00:44:39,605 --> 00:44:41,746
And as far as we can tell, these factors

999
00:44:41,746 --> 00:44:43,546
had no global correlations.

1000
00:44:45,286 --> 00:44:50,649
We've already discussed at the beginning team size on any absolute scale, production methodology,

1001
00:44:50,649 --> 00:44:55,051
whether team used Agile, Scrum, Waterfall, anything else, and financial incentives other

1002
00:44:55,051 --> 00:45:00,013
than individually tailored financial incentives, none of those had any global correlations

1003
00:45:00,013 --> 00:45:00,373
with outcomes.

1004
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:03,831
We had a couple questions about cross-functional

1005
00:45:03,831 --> 00:45:05,552
versus per-discipline teams.

1006
00:45:05,552 --> 00:45:07,732
Here, we saw no global correlation.

1007
00:45:07,732 --> 00:45:09,393
We asked a question about game genre.

1008
00:45:09,393 --> 00:45:10,993
And unfortunately, I like to think

1009
00:45:10,993 --> 00:45:14,314
that there are hidden correlations here,

1010
00:45:14,314 --> 00:45:16,815
but we provided about 25 different genre categories.

1011
00:45:16,815 --> 00:45:20,456
And once you take 273 answers and split them up

1012
00:45:20,456 --> 00:45:23,657
into 25 different game genre categories, shooter, tower

1013
00:45:23,657 --> 00:45:25,977
defense, city builder, all these other things,

1014
00:45:25,977 --> 00:45:27,578
your sample sizes are now too small

1015
00:45:27,578 --> 00:45:29,018
to really compare them to each other

1016
00:45:29,018 --> 00:45:30,418
of any statistical significance.

1017
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:34,011
Having a friend on the team was not correlated.

1018
00:45:34,011 --> 00:45:36,092
Sharing team members with other projects.

1019
00:45:36,092 --> 00:45:40,674
Having a preference for face-to-face communication

1020
00:45:40,674 --> 00:45:41,495
versus email.

1021
00:45:41,495 --> 00:45:43,816
Or a reliance on temp workers or contractors,

1022
00:45:43,816 --> 00:45:45,977
or the use of outsourced labor.

1023
00:45:45,977 --> 00:45:47,838
So it's interesting toward the end

1024
00:45:47,838 --> 00:45:49,939
that external labor had no global correlation,

1025
00:45:49,939 --> 00:45:52,140
or the use of contractors or temp workers.

1026
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:54,501
And what that probably just implies is that the real key

1027
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:57,242
here is not whether you use external talent.

1028
00:45:58,233 --> 00:46:00,255
It's what external talent you work with,

1029
00:46:00,255 --> 00:46:02,976
and how you build and manage that relationship,

1030
00:46:02,976 --> 00:46:05,558
and how carefully and diligently you

1031
00:46:05,558 --> 00:46:07,739
work with an outsourced team.

1032
00:46:07,739 --> 00:46:08,839
OK, let's talk about some of the conclusions

1033
00:46:08,839 --> 00:46:10,620
we can draw from this study.

1034
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:13,302
And here's the part where I get up on my soapbox a little bit

1035
00:46:13,302 --> 00:46:14,763
if I'm not there already.

1036
00:46:14,763 --> 00:46:16,544
Number one, let's start demanding evidence.

1037
00:46:25,698 --> 00:46:37,122
So the next time somebody tells you that Waterfall is the devil, and you have to use Agile or Scrum, and your game is totally doomed if you don't use their particular production methodology, ask them for evidence.

1038
00:46:37,122 --> 00:46:46,065
Ask them to prove that it works. Our industry is full of untested assumptions, and many practices persist because we don't question them.

1039
00:46:46,065 --> 00:46:54,847
And similarly, if someone tells you the only way to make your game truly great is to work 80-hour weeks, and your game is going to be total crap if you don't do that,

1040
00:46:56,438 --> 00:47:02,642
Ask for evidence for that, too. Ask for numbers. Ask for data.

1041
00:47:02,642 --> 00:47:09,547
Conclusion number two. The real opportunity for improving our

1042
00:47:09,547 --> 00:47:12,589
odds of better outcomes are mostly cultural. Back in 2012,

1043
00:47:12,589 --> 00:47:17,572
Bethesda Game Studios executive producer Todd Howard gave a

1044
00:47:17,572 --> 00:47:21,835
keynote speech at DICE and he showed this slide.

1045
00:47:23,455 --> 00:47:26,676
And he said the following, and I'm going to quote him verbatim here because I love this

1046
00:47:26,676 --> 00:47:26,876
quote.

1047
00:47:26,876 --> 00:47:32,037
This is one of the big rules that we have, which is the plan that you have is not as

1048
00:47:32,037 --> 00:47:34,697
important as your culture.

1049
00:47:34,697 --> 00:47:37,938
So you see a lot of game makers will say, so here's the big schedule, here's everything

1050
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:39,218
we're going to do.

1051
00:47:39,218 --> 00:47:41,719
You know, if they're really trying, they're going to run into problems.

1052
00:47:41,719 --> 00:47:45,159
And those problems are solved by the culture you have on your team.

1053
00:47:45,159 --> 00:47:46,380
I have my own way of putting it, which is this.

1054
00:47:50,877 --> 00:47:55,904
I believe every game is a reflection of the team that made it. If you want to make a better

1055
00:47:55,904 --> 00:48:01,311
game, you need to build a better team and a better culture on your team. In other words,

1056
00:48:01,311 --> 00:48:07,038
your game comes from your team and your team is a product of your culture. So if you want

1057
00:48:07,038 --> 00:48:09,762
to make a better game, build a better culture.

1058
00:48:12,126 --> 00:48:16,430
So the real opportunities for improving our odds of better outcomes are mostly cultural.

1059
00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:20,595
Leadership, teamwork and cultural factors accounted for more than 85% of the difference

1060
00:48:20,595 --> 00:48:23,377
between the best teams and the rest.

1061
00:48:23,377 --> 00:48:29,263
And before you resort to crunch, have you tried debugging your culture?

1062
00:48:29,263 --> 00:48:32,206
Have you tried debugging your development process?

1063
00:48:33,249 --> 00:48:39,214
And have you tried making sure the first 40 or 50 hours

1064
00:48:39,214 --> 00:48:43,117
every week that you're actually working

1065
00:48:43,117 --> 00:48:44,038
are actually being used efficiently?

1066
00:48:44,038 --> 00:48:44,879
Why scale something that's broken?

1067
00:48:44,879 --> 00:48:48,001
Number three, there is an established science

1068
00:48:48,001 --> 00:48:49,783
to building effective teams.

1069
00:48:49,783 --> 00:48:50,704
Let's start using it.

1070
00:48:50,704 --> 00:48:55,648
Our findings mirror those of management science exactly.

1071
00:48:55,648 --> 00:48:58,490
Be aware of the limitations of your own experience

1072
00:48:58,490 --> 00:48:59,111
and instincts.

1073
00:48:59,896 --> 00:49:04,582
recognize that our industry is not a unique and special snowflake. We are still humans

1074
00:49:04,582 --> 00:49:09,509
working in organizations and management research is equally relevant to us.

1075
00:49:09,509 --> 00:49:15,397
Number four, if you want to get the most out of your culture, you have to design it. It's not

1076
00:49:15,397 --> 00:49:17,380
going to happen by itself.

1077
00:49:19,522 --> 00:49:22,144
Write or update your mission and value statement.

1078
00:49:22,144 --> 00:49:22,824
It matters.

1079
00:49:22,824 --> 00:49:24,025
It really does.

1080
00:49:24,025 --> 00:49:26,147
Hire people who will embrace your values.

1081
00:49:26,147 --> 00:49:29,390
It's really not enough to say, hey,

1082
00:49:29,390 --> 00:49:32,252
my philosophy is to hire great people and get out of the way.

1083
00:49:32,252 --> 00:49:34,434
I've heard a lot of people in the game industry say that.

1084
00:49:34,434 --> 00:49:36,455
I just hire great people and get out of the way.

1085
00:49:36,455 --> 00:49:38,197
And if you really have that attitude,

1086
00:49:38,197 --> 00:49:40,558
if that's really how you go into leadership and game

1087
00:49:40,558 --> 00:49:42,520
development, you're missing about 95% of your job.

1088
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:45,042
Because you can hire the best people in the world.

1089
00:49:45,239 --> 00:49:49,341
they're still going to run into a million problems over the course of development.

1090
00:49:49,341 --> 00:49:54,284
And if you are just letting those problems fester,

1091
00:49:54,284 --> 00:49:56,305
you're going to run into big problems.

1092
00:49:56,305 --> 00:49:57,866
And your job as a leader is to proactively manage risk.

1093
00:49:57,866 --> 00:50:02,528
Designing your culture intentionally means it's your job

1094
00:50:02,528 --> 00:50:06,591
to incentivize the behaviors that align with your values

1095
00:50:06,591 --> 00:50:08,392
and disincentivize those that do not.

1096
00:50:08,392 --> 00:50:11,653
Actively shape your team's internal discourse

1097
00:50:11,653 --> 00:50:14,255
to promote healthy feedback and creative conflict.

1098
00:50:14,618 --> 00:50:17,960
in the creative process and minimize politics

1099
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:19,882
and interpersonal conflict.

1100
00:50:19,882 --> 00:50:23,284
And keep the millions of small problems and values

1101
00:50:23,284 --> 00:50:25,525
misalignments from turning into big ones.

1102
00:50:25,525 --> 00:50:26,546
And that's the end of my talk.

1103
00:50:26,546 --> 00:50:27,646
Our Gamma Citra articles are at that link

1104
00:50:27,646 --> 00:50:32,429
if you're interested in reading through those some more.

1105
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:35,451
If you have questions or feedback,

1106
00:50:35,451 --> 00:50:38,413
the Game Outcomes Project has a Twitter account.

1107
00:50:38,413 --> 00:50:39,913
We are just Game Outcomes on Twitter.

1108
00:50:41,727 --> 00:50:43,608
Those are the three books used in our study.

1109
00:50:43,608 --> 00:50:46,348
And again, I definitely recommend the two on the left,

1110
00:50:46,348 --> 00:50:48,169
Hackman and Lencioni.

1111
00:50:48,169 --> 00:50:51,350
We're going to do a new survey toward the end of this year.

1112
00:50:51,350 --> 00:50:54,110
And our plan is to keep evolving this every year or two

1113
00:50:54,110 --> 00:50:57,671
and refining it and finding better and better questions.

1114
00:50:57,671 --> 00:51:00,612
We're also doing another project on leader interviews.

1115
00:51:00,612 --> 00:51:04,553
One of our team, Eric Byron, is interviewing various leaders

1116
00:51:04,553 --> 00:51:06,394
within the game industry.

1117
00:51:06,394 --> 00:51:07,914
So if you're interested in participating,

1118
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:12,117
In that, there is Eric's email and I strongly recommend emailing him.

1119
00:51:12,117 --> 00:51:16,340
And finally, if you want to contact me, there's my contact info at the bottom.

1120
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:18,922
And we've got some time for questions, if anybody has any.

1121
00:51:18,922 --> 00:51:28,909
Thank you.

1122
00:51:28,909 --> 00:51:35,954
I'm curious if you check to see if other factors could account to explain crunch time in a linear regression.

1123
00:51:37,306 --> 00:51:40,471
Yeah, so the question was whether we check to see if

1124
00:51:40,471 --> 00:51:42,815
other factors could explain crunch.

1125
00:51:42,815 --> 00:51:46,220
We looked at cross correlations of the quantity of crunch

1126
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:48,563
and the outcomes with pretty much every other factor

1127
00:51:48,563 --> 00:51:50,707
that we could think of, including, you know,

1128
00:51:50,707 --> 00:51:52,830
project duration, team size and.

1129
00:51:54,104 --> 00:51:57,045
There's a note in our article, it does actually,

1130
00:51:57,045 --> 00:51:58,765
it's the fourth article in the series,

1131
00:51:58,765 --> 00:52:00,005
if you go to Gamma Citra,

1132
00:52:00,005 --> 00:52:01,565
there are actually pretty strong correlations

1133
00:52:01,565 --> 00:52:05,046
with especially things like lack of organization

1134
00:52:05,046 --> 00:52:08,387
and a lack of respect for team members, right?

1135
00:52:08,387 --> 00:52:10,647
It actually has very, the quantity of crunch,

1136
00:52:10,647 --> 00:52:13,467
people are far more likely to experience crunch

1137
00:52:13,467 --> 00:52:16,868
on a project if there is not a respectful relationship

1138
00:52:16,868 --> 00:52:18,908
between the management and the team,

1139
00:52:18,908 --> 00:52:21,049
which is exactly what you would expect.

1140
00:52:21,049 --> 00:52:22,269
So, next question.

1141
00:52:23,003 --> 00:52:30,887
Sure. How exactly did you define the different methodologies on the survey or did you just ask people if they were doing agile without any kind of framework to that?

1142
00:52:30,887 --> 00:52:39,011
Yeah, essentially, if you go to the GammaCytra articles, that has a link to our methodology page and you can download the actual questions directly from that.

1143
00:52:39,011 --> 00:52:40,832
But what we did was we asked...

1144
00:52:41,765 --> 00:52:44,166
you know, what production methodology a team was

1145
00:52:44,166 --> 00:52:46,967
generally using along with a description of what that meant.

1146
00:52:46,967 --> 00:52:50,248
So are you using waterfall and here's a brief description of

1147
00:52:50,248 --> 00:52:53,869
waterfall as a staged planning process versus a brief

1148
00:52:53,869 --> 00:52:57,170
description of Agile and so on. So next question.

1149
00:52:57,370 --> 00:53:02,397
great talk, enjoyed it. I had a question about the years of experience you used. It was kind of

1150
00:53:02,397 --> 00:53:08,084
like almost two, three, four, up to eight plus. You started off by mentioning you've been in

1151
00:53:08,084 --> 00:53:12,229
the industry for over 20 years. I thought that eight plus, I'd be interested in knowing

1152
00:53:12,269 --> 00:53:14,010
how that continues beyond, right?

1153
00:53:14,010 --> 00:53:15,852
What about 10 and 15?

1154
00:53:15,852 --> 00:53:20,796
And I really wish I had more data there, and certainly in the future we're going to refine those categories.

1155
00:53:20,796 --> 00:53:26,441
We'll probably ask, you know, we'll probably branch them into like average of 10, 15 or more and so on.

1156
00:53:26,441 --> 00:53:29,483
And we may also add a question asking the actual number of years.

1157
00:53:29,483 --> 00:53:34,768
And again, I'm sorry that we didn't do that, but in the next version of the study we'll do that for sure.

1158
00:53:34,768 --> 00:53:35,888
Next question.

1159
00:53:35,888 --> 00:53:37,350
Excellent talk, congrats.

1160
00:53:38,107 --> 00:53:46,076
In future surveys, will you be able to ask teams pre-release so that a positive outcome doesn't influence their recollections?

1161
00:53:46,076 --> 00:53:55,166
Right. The question was, in the future, will we be able to ask teams about their culture pre-release so that the outcome does not bias them?

1162
00:53:55,166 --> 00:53:58,830
We would definitely like to do that. We just have to make sure that we...

1163
00:53:59,590 --> 00:54:05,594
actually are able to match people up properly and it's going to require that people essentially fill out the survey twice.

1164
00:54:05,594 --> 00:54:10,356
Or at least two different versions of the same survey, the culture and then later on ask the outcome questions.

1165
00:54:10,356 --> 00:54:15,599
So, I think that would be a great way to help reduce some of the possible bias. Yes?

1166
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:19,821
For experience, was that team experience or experience as individuals?

1167
00:54:19,821 --> 00:54:24,443
Yeah, so the question was how we asked about the team experience and...

1168
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:27,883
what we asked was the average years of experience for people

1169
00:54:27,883 --> 00:54:30,626
on the team. So we asked people to tell us do people on your

1170
00:54:30,626 --> 00:54:35,411
team have an average of one to three years of experience, four

1171
00:54:35,411 --> 00:54:37,393
to six, seven to eight and so on.

1172
00:54:38,834 --> 00:54:41,296
their length of time together, working together.

1173
00:54:41,296 --> 00:54:41,536
Right.

1174
00:54:41,536 --> 00:54:43,238
There was nothing in there about their length of time

1175
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:44,259
working together as a team.

1176
00:54:44,259 --> 00:54:46,981
And that's actually a very powerful factor,

1177
00:54:46,981 --> 00:54:48,703
because teams that have just been put together

1178
00:54:48,703 --> 00:54:52,106
for the first time, certainly all the management research

1179
00:54:52,106 --> 00:54:53,767
they talked about at Wharton School

1180
00:54:53,767 --> 00:54:55,609
was that that has a very, very powerful effect.

1181
00:54:55,609 --> 00:54:56,950
So we should ask that in the future.

1182
00:54:56,950 --> 00:54:59,373
And we'll include that on the next version of the study.

1183
00:54:59,373 --> 00:54:59,453
Yes.

1184
00:54:59,808 --> 00:55:05,989
So in one of your slides you show the graph that essentially shows how fellow game developers

1185
00:55:05,989 --> 00:55:08,490
help one another outside of work.

1186
00:55:08,490 --> 00:55:17,472
Do you think a mentorship mentality like Shigeru Miyamoto's while he's developing a game, do

1187
00:55:17,472 --> 00:55:23,674
you think that's also beneficial to a healthy game development culture?

1188
00:55:23,674 --> 00:55:27,654
I'm sorry, the question was, I couldn't quite make out, you were asking about mentorship?

1189
00:55:27,654 --> 00:55:28,435
Was that correct?

1190
00:55:28,828 --> 00:55:30,668
Yes, do you think it's...

1191
00:55:30,668 --> 00:55:33,629
Yeah, I think mentorship is absolutely, you know,

1192
00:55:33,629 --> 00:55:36,329
extremely important and being able to learn on the job,

1193
00:55:36,329 --> 00:55:38,970
grow your skills continually.

1194
00:55:38,970 --> 00:55:42,771
And it's something that I think in the game industry,

1195
00:55:42,771 --> 00:55:45,111
even the top teams tend to take an attitude

1196
00:55:45,111 --> 00:55:47,512
of people should be taking that on themselves

1197
00:55:47,512 --> 00:55:50,372
rather than studios and companies

1198
00:55:50,372 --> 00:55:53,373
actually building development plans intentionally

1199
00:55:53,373 --> 00:55:55,874
for their developers, for their employees.

1200
00:55:55,874 --> 00:55:57,254
And I think that would help.

1201
00:55:57,254 --> 00:55:58,054
Thank you very much.

1202
00:55:58,054 --> 00:55:58,354
Yeah, yeah.

1203
00:55:59,125 --> 00:55:59,505
Yes.

1204
00:55:59,505 --> 00:55:59,685
Hi.

1205
00:55:59,685 --> 00:56:02,185
I was wondering if you could expound a little bit more

1206
00:56:02,185 --> 00:56:03,506
on communication.

1207
00:56:03,506 --> 00:56:06,206
You had a little point about how email versus face-to-face

1208
00:56:06,206 --> 00:56:08,307
didn't have a high correlation to outcome.

1209
00:56:08,307 --> 00:56:11,288
I was wondering if you studied, I may have missed this,

1210
00:56:11,288 --> 00:56:14,168
but virtual teams or grouping by discipline

1211
00:56:14,168 --> 00:56:16,649
versus grouping by team, stuff like that in an office.

1212
00:56:16,649 --> 00:56:16,969
Yeah.

1213
00:56:16,969 --> 00:56:19,910
So the question was about communication

1214
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:22,430
and what question we asked about that.

1215
00:56:23,007 --> 00:56:27,352
that was pretty much all we had as far as overall how the format

1216
00:56:27,352 --> 00:56:29,013
in which the communication occurred.

1217
00:56:29,013 --> 00:56:34,259
We did not ask any questions about virtual teams,

1218
00:56:34,259 --> 00:56:38,723
but we did ask about, let me go back here.

1219
00:56:38,723 --> 00:56:40,104
Wait, actually it's closer to the end.

1220
00:56:40,104 --> 00:56:40,725
Oh, come on now.

1221
00:56:40,725 --> 00:56:41,686
Sorry.

1222
00:56:41,686 --> 00:56:45,310
All right, let's go to the end here.

1223
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:49,022
Yeah, we did ask two separate questions about, here we go,

1224
00:56:49,022 --> 00:56:51,164
reliance on temp workers and contractors

1225
00:56:51,164 --> 00:56:52,205
and use of outsourced labor.

1226
00:56:52,205 --> 00:56:53,706
We did not ask about virtual teams.

1227
00:56:53,706 --> 00:56:56,568
But we do want to get more into this in the future

1228
00:56:56,568 --> 00:56:59,891
and find out, are there actual correlations?

1229
00:56:59,891 --> 00:56:59,991
So, yes.

1230
00:56:59,991 --> 00:57:07,697
Did you notice any correlation between methodologies

1231
00:57:07,697 --> 00:57:11,801
and duration specifically, as opposed to the aggregate?

1232
00:57:12,450 --> 00:57:16,754
Yes, so was there any correlation between methodologies and things like team size and

1233
00:57:16,754 --> 00:57:17,475
duration?

1234
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:19,257
And yes, there were.

1235
00:57:19,257 --> 00:57:24,482
One of the things was we found that larger teams are somewhat more likely to use waterfall

1236
00:57:24,482 --> 00:57:29,367
and smaller teams were somewhat more likely to use agile, which kind of makes sense because

1237
00:57:29,367 --> 00:57:32,050
if you're building some massive game that's like the next...

1238
00:57:32,230 --> 00:57:34,651
game in the call of duty franchise and you've got 200

1239
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:38,373
developers on your team, you've got a huge burn rate and you

1240
00:57:38,373 --> 00:57:40,933
really, really need to plan things out very, very carefully.

1241
00:57:40,933 --> 00:57:43,414
You can't afford to be agile and say, hey, we've suddenly

1242
00:57:43,414 --> 00:57:45,855
come up with this great idea for our game design, let's just

1243
00:57:45,855 --> 00:57:47,676
pivot this entire 200-person team.

1244
00:57:47,676 --> 00:57:49,216
It's a lot harder to pivot.

1245
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:53,578
So you'll notice this one here, the orange line is waterfall.

1246
00:57:53,578 --> 00:57:56,039
It sort of goes up toward the right, indicating that larger

1247
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:56,459
teams.

1248
00:57:56,859 --> 00:58:02,003
more likely to use waterfall and the smaller teams are more

1249
00:58:02,003 --> 00:58:05,305
likely to use agile and scrum because they are small enough

1250
00:58:05,305 --> 00:58:07,106
and versatile and agile enough.

1251
00:58:07,519 --> 00:58:12,545
to use those methodologies. We also occasionally post, do

1252
00:58:12,545 --> 00:58:15,088
additional analysis of our findings, find correlations

1253
00:58:15,088 --> 00:58:17,530
between some of the different factors and not just with

1254
00:58:17,530 --> 00:58:20,894
outcomes. And if you follow us at Game Outcomes on Twitter, we

1255
00:58:20,894 --> 00:58:23,937
occasionally post them there. So we've also got some historical

1256
00:58:23,937 --> 00:58:26,801
stuff on that. If you scroll through our Twitter feed, you

1257
00:58:26,801 --> 00:58:28,683
should find them. Next question?

1258
00:58:29,073 --> 00:58:33,615
Yeah, did you ask about either individual or team level

1259
00:58:33,615 --> 00:58:35,836
of experience with any of the individual?

1260
00:58:35,836 --> 00:58:38,277
Like, did you ask about how experienced

1261
00:58:38,277 --> 00:58:39,758
is your team with Agile versus Waterfall?

1262
00:58:39,758 --> 00:58:41,779
How experienced are you in this industry?

1263
00:58:41,779 --> 00:58:42,740
Great, great question.

1264
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:44,881
So the question was, did we ask how experienced

1265
00:58:44,881 --> 00:58:46,722
is the team with Agile or Scrum, or how long

1266
00:58:46,722 --> 00:58:47,982
has the team worked together?

1267
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:49,883
What's the team's overall level of experience?

1268
00:58:49,883 --> 00:58:51,184
We did not ask that.

1269
00:58:51,184 --> 00:58:52,685
My instincts tell me, and I think

1270
00:58:52,685 --> 00:58:55,366
what I learned about management science,

1271
00:58:55,366 --> 00:58:57,907
would tell me that both of those would be huge factors.

1272
00:58:58,167 --> 00:59:03,289
So we will try to include those on the next version of our talk, if at all possible, of our survey, if at all possible.

1273
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:03,830
Yes.

1274
00:59:03,830 --> 00:59:05,890
Hi. Great talk. It was awesome.

1275
00:59:05,890 --> 00:59:10,912
And I apologize if this is a question that I believe you addressed in the talk, but I didn't quite catch.

1276
00:59:10,912 --> 00:59:20,316
In terms of how the outcomes were viewed, I got that a lot of it was provided in terms of the team's perception of outcome.

1277
00:59:20,316 --> 00:59:26,919
Was there any information on actual outcome, so money made or by the game, etc.?

1278
00:59:27,379 --> 00:59:28,940
Yes, so that's a good point.

1279
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:31,541
The outcome score is a lot of it was based on the team's

1280
00:59:31,541 --> 00:59:32,482
perception of outcome.

1281
00:59:32,482 --> 00:59:34,763
And the question of how do we know the team wasn't just

1282
00:59:34,763 --> 00:59:37,024
saying, oh, we did great, when actually they did terrible,

1283
00:59:37,024 --> 00:59:37,705
or vice versa, right?

1284
00:59:37,705 --> 00:59:41,687
So one of the things we did, and this isn't necessarily

1285
00:59:41,687 --> 00:59:44,328
100% scientific here, but we had an optional question

1286
00:59:44,328 --> 00:59:44,968
at the end.

1287
00:59:45,615 --> 00:59:48,536
you know, asking what project people actually worked on. And

1288
00:59:48,536 --> 00:59:53,378
so based on that, we were able to analyze, you know, we had the

1289
00:59:53,378 --> 00:59:57,020
outcome question of what was the game's Metacritic score, what

1290
00:59:57,020 --> 00:59:59,261
was the overall critical reception and people would

1291
00:59:59,261 --> 01:00:02,862
answer, oh, my Metacritic was between 70 and 75, between 76

1292
01:00:02,862 --> 01:00:05,623
and 80, between 81, 85 and so on, answered based on those

1293
01:00:05,623 --> 01:00:08,304
categories. So we were actually able to cross correlate those

1294
01:00:08,304 --> 01:00:12,006
and say, hey, this, you know, this person worked on shadows of

1295
01:00:12,006 --> 01:00:14,667
Mordor, Donkey Kong Country returns, whatever game

1296
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:17,583
And they answered that this was their critical reception.

1297
01:00:17,583 --> 01:00:19,866
Let's actually look up the Metacritic score.

1298
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:22,008
And even though there were about 20 of them,

1299
01:00:22,008 --> 01:00:25,192
we found that they were all answered honestly.

1300
01:00:25,192 --> 01:00:27,694
Every single one of them, the category

1301
01:00:27,694 --> 01:00:30,037
that they had filled in for the Metacritic score

1302
01:00:30,037 --> 01:00:32,940
was what the actual Metacritic score for that game was.

1303
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:35,563
And again, it's too bad that we only knew what 5% of the games

1304
01:00:35,563 --> 01:00:35,923
were.

1305
01:00:36,398 --> 01:00:38,418
and that we can't tell you who answered what, right,

1306
01:00:38,418 --> 01:00:40,199
because that's confidential.

1307
01:00:40,199 --> 01:00:41,739
But that was a nice reinforcement

1308
01:00:41,739 --> 01:00:43,739
that people did seem to be answering

1309
01:00:43,739 --> 01:00:45,339
these questions honestly.

1310
01:00:45,339 --> 01:00:46,540
So thank you.

1311
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:48,640
Regarding survey methodology, for the questions

1312
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:51,661
that you pulled from Linceone and Hackman,

1313
01:00:51,661 --> 01:00:54,681
were those questions, did they have an established ChromeVox

1314
01:00:54,681 --> 01:00:56,061
alpha level for them?

1315
01:00:56,061 --> 01:00:57,102
An established what?

1316
01:00:57,102 --> 01:00:59,722
Like an alpha level, like that they

1317
01:00:59,722 --> 01:01:01,643
were reliable and valid questions,

1318
01:01:01,643 --> 01:01:03,103
or were they just questions from the book?

1319
01:01:03,908 --> 01:01:06,029
Oh, oh, yeah, so how did we design the questions

1320
01:01:06,029 --> 01:01:07,950
from the Hackman and Lencioni model?

1321
01:01:07,950 --> 01:01:12,651
Yeah, essentially, it was the whole Game Outcomes Project

1322
01:01:12,651 --> 01:01:15,112
team going through these models and just

1323
01:01:15,112 --> 01:01:17,253
trying to find the questions that we thought

1324
01:01:17,253 --> 01:01:21,174
correlated most closely with what the Hackman and Lencioni

1325
01:01:21,174 --> 01:01:22,935
model represented.

1326
01:01:22,935 --> 01:01:23,615
So, yeah.

1327
01:01:24,175 --> 01:01:26,896
There's no, I don't think there are any official like surveys

1328
01:01:26,896 --> 01:01:28,456
of the Hackman and Lensini models.

1329
01:01:28,456 --> 01:01:29,176
I didn't think so.

1330
01:01:29,176 --> 01:01:30,417
That's why I wanted to ask.

1331
01:01:30,417 --> 01:01:32,877
I think there is one for the Gallup model,

1332
01:01:32,877 --> 01:01:34,418
but I don't know, I don't have access

1333
01:01:34,418 --> 01:01:36,558
to the actual questions.

1334
01:01:36,558 --> 01:01:37,538
Okay, I think so.

1335
01:01:37,538 --> 01:01:38,239
Yep, last question.

1336
01:01:38,239 --> 01:01:38,579
Yep.

1337
01:01:38,579 --> 01:01:41,139
By the way, if anybody, I think we're running out of time,

1338
01:01:41,139 --> 01:01:42,760
but if anybody has any more questions,

1339
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:45,160
ping us anytime at gameoutcomes on Twitter.

1340
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:47,921
Let me put up that link again.

1341
01:01:47,921 --> 01:01:48,701
All right.

1342
01:01:48,701 --> 01:01:48,901
Whoops.

1343
01:01:48,901 --> 01:01:49,141
Thank you.

1344
01:01:58,550 --> 01:01:59,019
Thank you.
