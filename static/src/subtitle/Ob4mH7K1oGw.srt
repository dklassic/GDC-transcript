1
00:00:06,288 --> 00:00:11,411
Hi, I'm Samantha, Julian, Tanya, and Tara.

2
00:00:11,591 --> 00:00:13,613
And three of us are from Tender Claws.

3
00:00:14,013 --> 00:00:15,054
Tara's from Piehole.

4
00:00:15,434 --> 00:00:17,995
And we're going to be talking about integrating live actors

5
00:00:18,175 --> 00:00:20,257
into a non-location-based experience.

6
00:00:22,038 --> 00:00:24,299
So how many of you know a little bit about Tender Claws

7
00:00:24,379 --> 00:00:25,200
or have heard about us?

8
00:00:26,561 --> 00:00:26,841
Cool.

9
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:29,143
Awesome.

10
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:31,424
So our studio kind of works across a range

11
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:32,905
of different disciplines and media.

12
00:00:33,761 --> 00:00:39,450
Our two most recent projects are the AR app Tendar and VR for virtual virtual reality,

13
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:44,818
but we've also worked across mobile apps, installation, visual arts, and even sports

14
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:46,481
with tumbleweed and leaf blowers.

15
00:00:49,377 --> 00:00:53,440
And one of the things we're going to be talking about today in terms of the XR community is

16
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:58,483
there's a lot of legitimate and well-founded buzz about the parallels, crossovers, and

17
00:00:58,563 --> 00:01:02,286
intersections between theater, live performance, and immersive digital media.

18
00:01:03,346 --> 00:01:09,010
The term virtual reality actually comes from about the 1920s and 1930s when Artaud was

19
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:09,771
writing this book.

20
00:01:10,551 --> 00:01:14,218
about some of his essays and his experience with theater

21
00:01:14,899 --> 00:01:15,861
called Theater in Stubble.

22
00:01:16,162 --> 00:01:17,865
And I've highlighted the term virtual reality.

23
00:01:18,045 --> 00:01:19,909
So you can see this is of course translated from French,

24
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:21,752
which the meaning is slightly different there.

25
00:01:23,721 --> 00:01:26,402
So when people talk about including live actors,

26
00:01:27,302 --> 00:01:30,123
it's often considering a really promising and interesting space,

27
00:01:30,283 --> 00:01:33,344
but is often kind of dismissed as being a little bit difficult

28
00:01:33,684 --> 00:01:37,085
for obvious reasons, for possibly production or scale.

29
00:01:37,565 --> 00:01:40,105
But it's such a fruitful and interesting territory

30
00:01:40,145 --> 00:01:41,646
that we think it's worth pushing it,

31
00:01:42,646 --> 00:01:45,387
and pushing on the constraints, and finding unique ways

32
00:01:45,467 --> 00:01:48,588
and opportunities to give home access to live performers.

33
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:51,179
So when we were creating this project,

34
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:53,499
these are some of the design considerations

35
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:55,360
that we were originally wrestling with.

36
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:59,121
And as artists who have history working with theater and VR,

37
00:01:59,141 --> 00:02:01,262
and who have spent the last year in the trenches

38
00:02:01,302 --> 00:02:03,162
working on this kind of non-location-based

39
00:02:03,242 --> 00:02:05,263
at-home experience, we wanted to give this talk

40
00:02:05,383 --> 00:02:08,704
to spark further discussion about how performers

41
00:02:08,764 --> 00:02:11,845
could be integrated outside location-based

42
00:02:11,905 --> 00:02:13,185
entertainment, or LBE.

43
00:02:13,765 --> 00:02:16,026
So here are some of the things that we're trying

44
00:02:16,106 --> 00:02:17,566
as a jumping-off point for bringing

45
00:02:17,606 --> 00:02:18,666
live actors into the home.

46
00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:23,728
And these are the structure of some of the things we're going to talk about today and

47
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:24,909
who's going to be talking about them.

48
00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:31,291
So to start, I'm going to show a little bit of teaser of the under presents.

49
00:02:56,935 --> 00:03:01,278
Distinguished guests, are you looking for a little entertainment?

50
00:03:01,779 --> 00:03:03,420
You've come to the right place.

51
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,882
A venue outside of time and space.

52
00:03:07,463 --> 00:03:08,303
May I present...

53
00:03:10,645 --> 00:03:11,285
The Under.

54
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:18,310
Sweet.

55
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:22,433
So, for some context on The Under Presents, there's actually these two intersecting worlds.

56
00:03:23,095 --> 00:03:27,217
So the game begins in the Under, which is this kind of vaudeville stage that exists

57
00:03:27,277 --> 00:03:28,458
outside time and space.

58
00:03:29,018 --> 00:03:33,581
It's inhabited by these quirky lost voyages and souls that wander off course and became

59
00:03:33,621 --> 00:03:39,205
lost in time, and then they all kind of perform for you under the guise of this mysterious

60
00:03:39,665 --> 00:03:42,787
MC, or the proprietor of the stage.

61
00:03:44,233 --> 00:03:46,934
But it's important to say that there's actually a story within a story.

62
00:03:47,274 --> 00:03:51,497
So even though we'll be talking mostly about the under and some of the live elements that are there,

63
00:03:51,877 --> 00:03:56,759
there's actually a long-form content of another narrative that takes place on a ship,

64
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:03,383
which is the last few months of an ill-fated trip from a research vessel,

65
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:06,945
where players witness a survival narrative that unfolds between characters,

66
00:04:07,305 --> 00:04:11,647
while discovering that they may or may not have the power to influence the crew's fate

67
00:04:11,767 --> 00:04:13,588
and change how time operates on the ship.

68
00:04:15,609 --> 00:04:21,792
Tara is going to quickly briefly run you through some of the context of the ways we're using live actors so we can talk about this.

69
00:04:23,494 --> 00:04:29,177
Yes, so two of the main ways that we are talking about that we're using live actors in the experience.

70
00:04:29,898 --> 00:04:39,003
One is doing these live stage acts as hosts and so we create these different types of acts like a jazzercise routine or a game show.

71
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:45,087
And that takes place on the stage of the under, which is highlighted on the left side.

72
00:04:46,108 --> 00:04:48,930
And different characters can slot into those roles.

73
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:55,794
So you can have different characters who do the game show host, depending on which actor is plugging into that act.

74
00:04:56,794 --> 00:05:01,996
And over on the right, this is an example of a one-on-one live encounter.

75
00:05:02,576 --> 00:05:10,659
And those can happen in multiple locations, but they tend to take place in more intimate spaces and create a more intimate experience for the player.

76
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:18,522
So the actors would inhabit these different avatars, and those are highlighted up there.

77
00:05:19,965 --> 00:05:25,171
And they interact with the players who have a more anonymous look to them to their design

78
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:27,454
and

79
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:28,695
beyond those two

80
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:35,483
Specific live actor roles. We also have the actors inhabiting NPC characters

81
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:42,546
that you see in the more narrative, the survival narrative part of the experience that Samantha was just talking about.

82
00:05:43,066 --> 00:05:48,709
So in other words, you would hear, you would see pre-recorded scenes with those characters,

83
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:55,192
but we also have live actors at key moments possessing those NPC characters,

84
00:05:55,933 --> 00:06:00,035
NPCs, and making, having these live moments with them.

85
00:06:00,946 --> 00:06:06,451
And so beyond those three roles, we work with actors to develop characterization, voice,

86
00:06:06,631 --> 00:06:11,034
and story, and structure of these moments, and develop movement with them.

87
00:06:11,795 --> 00:06:18,100
So each actor is able to actually have their own characters that kind of go with their

88
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:24,144
â€“ play to their strengths and abilities, and then they kind of tailor each pre-structured

89
00:06:24,325 --> 00:06:28,488
experience or encounter to their own thing, their own vibe.

90
00:06:30,104 --> 00:06:30,805
So, yeah.

91
00:06:34,929 --> 00:06:37,452
So as a lead designer, narrative designer rather,

92
00:06:37,492 --> 00:06:39,033
I'm gonna be talking about scripting.

93
00:06:39,934 --> 00:06:42,417
And how do you create scripts for kind of

94
00:06:42,657 --> 00:06:47,001
more improv live characters and acts.

95
00:06:47,662 --> 00:06:50,024
The scripts have to simultaneously be structured,

96
00:06:50,164 --> 00:06:52,026
but also modular and variable

97
00:06:52,126 --> 00:06:53,628
so that they can feel responsive.

98
00:06:55,011 --> 00:06:59,055
And some of the inspirations for the project that led to our thoughts on scripting are

99
00:06:59,115 --> 00:07:00,596
these three medias.

100
00:07:00,877 --> 00:07:03,419
Anybody recognize any of them besides Journey?

101
00:07:05,381 --> 00:07:05,641
Cool.

102
00:07:06,122 --> 00:07:11,887
So we take a lot of our inspiration from not just games, but from different media as well.

103
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:17,793
So this book called The Invention of Morale is largely about a time loop that features

104
00:07:17,933 --> 00:07:18,894
echoes of the past.

105
00:07:19,434 --> 00:07:23,715
It's ambiguous to the reader if the characters inside it are kind of living or recording,

106
00:07:24,316 --> 00:07:28,657
but it's key that because the narrator believes they are alive,

107
00:07:29,197 --> 00:07:32,658
it transforms the narrator from a spectator into a participant.

108
00:07:33,198 --> 00:07:39,620
And that ambiguity heightens the mystery and the desire to explore the island for this narrator.

109
00:07:41,555 --> 00:07:44,257
and Sleep No More, which is a pretty well-known,

110
00:07:44,277 --> 00:07:46,098
you know, immersive theater piece,

111
00:07:46,278 --> 00:07:47,439
it also operates on a loop.

112
00:07:48,019 --> 00:07:50,340
If a guest is really persistent with a character,

113
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:53,983
they may be rewarded by the character breaking their loop

114
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:55,303
to engage in the guest

115
00:07:55,383 --> 00:07:57,325
with an intimate one-on-one encounter.

116
00:07:57,885 --> 00:07:59,826
This act of signaling out the guest

117
00:07:59,906 --> 00:08:02,828
creates a heightened moment where the player is seen,

118
00:08:03,468 --> 00:08:06,230
and the process of being seen is really important

119
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,691
to enhance the feel of liveness.

120
00:08:08,775 --> 00:08:11,395
And then finally, in terms of multiplayer interaction,

121
00:08:11,455 --> 00:08:13,576
a game that I think was really seminal for a lot of us,

122
00:08:14,176 --> 00:08:17,217
especially as a Tender Cloves' Journey,

123
00:08:17,977 --> 00:08:21,818
we're thinking about how when we first played Journey,

124
00:08:21,898 --> 00:08:23,298
there was a very formative moment

125
00:08:23,338 --> 00:08:26,539
when we realized that what we thought was our AI guide

126
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:28,939
was actually another living person

127
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:30,980
that we were able to recognize

128
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,600
that through their motions and intent.

129
00:08:34,141 --> 00:08:37,021
So at that moment was something super powerful

130
00:08:37,401 --> 00:08:38,422
that I'm gonna kind of get to.

131
00:08:40,084 --> 00:08:53,146
We also decided to, in terms of the multiplayer experience, limit some of the ways that players can communicate with each other purposely in order to encourage emergent forms of play and new ways of communication and gesture between players.

132
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:59,190
So what all of the references have in common

133
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,891
is this idea of a pivot point

134
00:09:01,271 --> 00:09:03,352
between liveness and non-liveness

135
00:09:03,873 --> 00:09:06,614
and how they come into contact to generate a space

136
00:09:06,654 --> 00:09:09,376
where there's an extraordinary awareness of the other.

137
00:09:09,856 --> 00:09:11,317
It's sort of an uncanny space.

138
00:09:12,217 --> 00:09:14,579
And I realize, you know, the uncanny valley,

139
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:16,079
there's connotations within that,

140
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,800
and it shares some of the features

141
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,941
of what I'm talking about,

142
00:09:19,021 --> 00:09:22,143
but instead of eliciting a cold, eerie feeling

143
00:09:22,183 --> 00:09:25,004
of coming against another kind of humanoid creature,

144
00:09:25,845 --> 00:09:31,328
I'm choosing to use the uncanny as a term to describe the space of discomfort and wonder

145
00:09:31,869 --> 00:09:36,952
that derives from comforting the ontology of another being as simultaneously human and

146
00:09:37,032 --> 00:09:42,876
non-human, and the power that mystery generates in that moment to hold our attention and to

147
00:09:42,996 --> 00:09:46,338
bring in players into focusing on specific areas of the game.

148
00:09:49,313 --> 00:09:53,656
So the main impact of the uncanny is a way to focus and draw attention to key story moments.

149
00:09:54,556 --> 00:10:00,960
It also adds magic and anticipation to pre-recorded content that is much less resource intensive

150
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:05,703
because there's a sense that anything could happen at any time and in many ways in the structure of

151
00:10:05,783 --> 00:10:12,708
our game it can and does. But this can be more or less true in certain areas of the under especially.

152
00:10:13,628 --> 00:10:15,570
There's something that I'd like to show which kind of

153
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:23,012
For me, it exemplifies the moment when an outside player or user is brushing up against

154
00:10:23,052 --> 00:10:27,813
this definition of movement that is both living and not living simultaneously, and how that

155
00:10:27,853 --> 00:10:29,794
kind of instates wonder and attraction.

156
00:10:30,514 --> 00:10:34,115
And this is this beautiful, scored, unintentional performance piece.

157
00:10:48,824 --> 00:10:53,967
So at the Living Mannequin, the purpose of that is to kind of bring this liveness into

158
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:59,592
the space to attract passerbys and have them wander into the world of the store, into the

159
00:10:59,632 --> 00:11:03,455
world of the setup, or refocus attention to specific objects.

160
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:10,768
And in terms of, I think, punctuating a lot of what we're going to be doing in the game

161
00:11:10,788 --> 00:11:16,011
with these moments that are one-on-one, I'm thinking that some of them can start in a

162
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:19,513
way that there's a kind of discrepancy and mystery.

163
00:11:19,734 --> 00:11:24,476
Is this, you know, other person, is this other character, this other, you know, NPC or performer

164
00:11:24,536 --> 00:11:25,357
living or non?

165
00:11:26,177 --> 00:11:30,340
And in order to actually write for that.

166
00:11:31,488 --> 00:11:34,749
There's ways to work around the technical and design narrative constraints,

167
00:11:34,889 --> 00:11:38,230
the resources that you need to keep character consistency

168
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:42,951
and maintain character voice without needing the same actor on staff 24-7.

169
00:11:43,592 --> 00:11:47,573
So basically what I'm saying is that there are certain NPCs,

170
00:11:47,613 --> 00:11:50,974
and this is one particular moment of how we use live actors,

171
00:11:51,014 --> 00:11:52,674
this isn't like all of the different ways,

172
00:11:53,355 --> 00:11:57,376
where they can be inhabited and possessed by a live actor.

173
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:02,592
And it's not immediately clear to the player that that is what's happening.

174
00:12:03,773 --> 00:12:08,996
However, the constraint is because we have the character and we have the voice actor,

175
00:12:09,756 --> 00:12:12,758
this is an established character, people know the voice of this character.

176
00:12:13,198 --> 00:12:19,982
So how do you create dialogue that any actor can join in and use the voice of the character to interact with the player?

177
00:12:21,443 --> 00:12:29,307
And a lot of the kind of, I think, nuance about writing this dialogue in this way is really interesting.

178
00:12:30,368 --> 00:12:34,530
So one way that we could approach this and that we're working on is this idea of soundboards.

179
00:12:36,051 --> 00:12:41,654
What we'll get into later is there's actually, it's very much how our actors engage with the audience.

180
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:42,835
It's very much like puppetry.

181
00:12:43,255 --> 00:12:48,978
So there's certain interfaces they can manipulate and work with that we're trying to make more natural and seamless.

182
00:12:49,699 --> 00:12:53,241
And one of these interfaces is a way of triggering sound clips.

183
00:12:53,641 --> 00:12:58,544
But it's not just, I think it's not just like any writing for sound clips will work.

184
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:05,229
It has to be a very, a combination between how the actor knows to trigger the sound clips at the right time,

185
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:09,911
and what feels right for their performance, and writing that feels seamless and interruptible.

186
00:13:13,496 --> 00:13:17,760
So in order to kind of script narrative encounters, one of the ways I'm thinking about this is

187
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,121
creating narrative backbone.

188
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:20,402
There's a guiding principle.

189
00:13:20,422 --> 00:13:27,007
There needs to be enough anchoring, like points within the encounter to give context to why

190
00:13:27,067 --> 00:13:30,910
the player is there, why the actor is, what their minimum roles are, so that there can

191
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:35,474
actually be room left for the player to enter these roles and enter into play with the actor.

192
00:13:39,248 --> 00:13:45,891
One of the things we're thinking about is how to focus these encounters on a meditative activity or an activity that can be shared,

193
00:13:46,491 --> 00:13:52,814
because that also opens up a room for play and ways that the player can be responsive to the actor,

194
00:13:52,874 --> 00:14:03,339
and the actor can know how to trigger certain bins or certain areas to feel very responsive and one-on-one sound clips, depending on what the player is doing.

195
00:14:05,968 --> 00:14:13,430
And as players are engaging with the actor, it's kind of like they're performing along

196
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:14,190
with the actor.

197
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:17,250
They're really filling in the blanks of what is happening.

198
00:14:19,251 --> 00:14:24,272
And depending on how the player is engaging with them, actors can kind of decide how much

199
00:14:24,352 --> 00:14:28,813
dialogue they want to trigger, whether they want to do a lot of the interaction through

200
00:14:28,893 --> 00:14:33,354
gestures, whether there's certain points they want to trigger exact elements of the story

201
00:14:33,394 --> 00:14:34,795
to punctuate what is happening.

202
00:14:35,535 --> 00:14:40,599
And it's up to, like, I worked with Ben Vegas and Pyhole to develop a lot of these storyboards,

203
00:14:40,659 --> 00:14:46,764
and it's up to us as writers to kind of create basically text and framework for the actor

204
00:14:46,784 --> 00:14:50,727
to use as improv tools from their toolbox to kind of grab from, right?

205
00:14:55,171 --> 00:14:58,994
So I can kind of give a very specific example.

206
00:14:59,534 --> 00:15:02,777
This is like an early draft of one particular NPC.

207
00:15:03,828 --> 00:15:07,811
And the context is that they're on an island skipping stones,

208
00:15:08,131 --> 00:15:11,913
and it's a very short meditative action.

209
00:15:12,133 --> 00:15:16,296
But there's a narrative backbone,

210
00:15:16,336 --> 00:15:18,077
which is mostly on the left, that

211
00:15:18,137 --> 00:15:22,660
is digestible, small, breakable chunks that can be triggered,

212
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,781
maybe in sequence.

213
00:15:24,241 --> 00:15:25,902
But it doesn't have to all be triggered.

214
00:15:26,623 --> 00:15:30,425
And it can also be kind of, yeah,

215
00:15:30,465 --> 00:15:32,307
triggered at the actor's decision.

216
00:15:33,546 --> 00:15:39,070
It's important when thinking about writing this sort of way that like each of these kind of have to stand on their own

217
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:44,515
because you don't know how much time is going to be passed between the next element that's triggered.

218
00:15:45,576 --> 00:15:50,801
So they have to be complete thoughts and they have to all kind of relate to the tone and the atmosphere that the actor is

219
00:15:50,821 --> 00:15:51,501
trying to convey.

220
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:56,952
So on the right, there's also a way to,

221
00:15:57,112 --> 00:15:59,154
and these are just small samples,

222
00:15:59,274 --> 00:16:01,175
really you need I think a larger set,

223
00:16:01,636 --> 00:16:04,238
but a way to create bins where the actor knows

224
00:16:04,278 --> 00:16:08,021
that okay, if I create, if this person throws a rock,

225
00:16:08,321 --> 00:16:10,523
the rock mechanic is really like elaborate,

226
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:12,325
so it's actually really like skipping stones,

227
00:16:12,345 --> 00:16:13,766
and it's not the best throw.

228
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:16,048
Maybe they wanna create a one-on-one,

229
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:17,589
a one-to-one response to that,

230
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:19,191
and they know that there's a bin

231
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:20,592
that they can trigger to do so.

232
00:16:21,112 --> 00:16:28,655
And that the tone of that bin will be short responses that are non-repeatable, that can

233
00:16:28,735 --> 00:16:31,396
feel kind of a little bit of natural in the moment.

234
00:16:31,576 --> 00:16:35,318
And how you actually have to write for that is really complicated, because you have to

235
00:16:35,338 --> 00:16:40,040
vary sentence length, you have to make sure that the actor knows that it's not just going

236
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:43,621
to be one statement and one's a question, and they won't know how to respond to that

237
00:16:43,641 --> 00:16:44,161
in the moment.

238
00:16:44,241 --> 00:16:48,443
They know there has to be a uniformity to the particular bins they're triggering.

239
00:16:52,072 --> 00:17:01,201
And finally, on the left, because the stone throwing is rather realistic, we want to create

240
00:17:01,281 --> 00:17:08,869
a sort of, invite the physicality of the actor and the player into the scene.

241
00:17:10,722 --> 00:17:16,345
If the actor decides it's relevant, they can actually train and teach the player to

242
00:17:16,405 --> 00:17:22,288
kind of throw the stone in ways that they might engage or give tips that feel responsive

243
00:17:22,328 --> 00:17:24,689
to the action that the player is doing at that moment.

244
00:17:31,513 --> 00:17:35,635
And then one of the things I think on the right you can see.

245
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:40,022
That's writing for these spaces of how the,

246
00:17:40,122 --> 00:17:41,542
and I know Tara's gonna talk about this,

247
00:17:41,742 --> 00:17:44,483
but ways that the players may respond to the actors.

248
00:17:44,944 --> 00:17:46,784
It's a little bit of kind of fortune telling,

249
00:17:47,084 --> 00:17:48,465
both trial and error and fortune telling,

250
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:50,366
where you think, okay, what are the range

251
00:17:50,406 --> 00:17:52,287
of player possibilities and ways

252
00:17:52,327 --> 00:17:53,727
that they can engage with the actor?

253
00:17:53,767 --> 00:17:55,108
What are things they might do?

254
00:17:55,668 --> 00:17:57,529
And then you have to have a backup plan

255
00:17:57,569 --> 00:18:01,110
for the actor to, you know, if someone teleports away,

256
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,011
what do they say?

257
00:18:02,351 --> 00:18:03,471
You know, what are some of the ways

258
00:18:03,511 --> 00:18:04,592
they can engage with that?

259
00:18:05,872 --> 00:18:10,814
And we are open, we want the player to be able to leave

260
00:18:10,954 --> 00:18:13,855
and feel that's correct, so we're not trying

261
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:14,535
to bring them back.

262
00:18:14,935 --> 00:18:17,376
But we still have to think about how the actor responds

263
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:19,877
to exact different ways players can behave.

264
00:18:19,917 --> 00:18:23,058
And of course, it's live, so there's so many things

265
00:18:23,098 --> 00:18:26,279
we can't account for, and that's part of the magic.

266
00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:28,660
So now Julian is gonna talk about

267
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,100
interfaces and infrastructure.

268
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:35,302
Thank you.

269
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:35,642
Hi everyone.

270
00:18:37,288 --> 00:18:40,450
When you're integrating live performers into an immersive VR experience,

271
00:18:40,831 --> 00:18:42,872
you have to decide what you're optimizing for.

272
00:18:43,813 --> 00:18:48,055
For The Under Presents, we want to create intimate moments between players and actors.

273
00:18:48,736 --> 00:18:51,498
And we want to maximize the number of meaningful interactions

274
00:18:51,918 --> 00:18:53,459
where a player feels truly special.

275
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:59,123
We don't think that we could accomplish this by having a single shared space with hundreds of players.

276
00:18:59,743 --> 00:19:02,044
It just wouldn't facilitate those kinds of interactions.

277
00:19:03,015 --> 00:19:05,776
Instead, we're aiming to have lots of shared spaces

278
00:19:06,296 --> 00:19:08,217
that each have 10 to 20 players.

279
00:19:11,058 --> 00:19:12,378
That leads us to these questions.

280
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,600
How do players and live performers join these shared spaces?

281
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,801
And when they join a space, which space do they end up in?

282
00:19:22,622 --> 00:19:25,123
How do multiplayer interactions work within these spaces?

283
00:19:26,243 --> 00:19:28,024
And what tools do the live performers have

284
00:19:28,444 --> 00:19:31,245
to facilitate unique magical moments for the players?

285
00:19:32,678 --> 00:19:35,899
Hi, I'm Julian, and as a systems developer at TenderClause,

286
00:19:36,399 --> 00:19:38,480
it's been one of my roles to try to come up

287
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,660
with good solutions and implementations

288
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,660
for these questions.

289
00:19:43,441 --> 00:19:45,821
First, how do players and live performers

290
00:19:45,881 --> 00:19:47,582
join shared networked spaces?

291
00:19:47,602 --> 00:19:50,542
Remember, here's the player on the left,

292
00:19:50,762 --> 00:19:52,823
and for them, the answer is really simple.

293
00:19:53,843 --> 00:19:55,683
Similar to Journey, we want to give them

294
00:19:55,823 --> 00:19:57,924
very seamless experience where they don't need

295
00:19:57,944 --> 00:20:00,324
to think about how the networking works,

296
00:20:00,484 --> 00:20:01,545
they just enter the space.

297
00:20:03,222 --> 00:20:06,285
Behind the scenes, their client makes a request to our back-end servers,

298
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:10,589
and that causes the back-end servers to verify the player's identity,

299
00:20:11,129 --> 00:20:16,214
retrieve the information about past encounters that that player has had.

300
00:20:16,995 --> 00:20:20,378
And then we retrieve information from our database

301
00:20:21,018 --> 00:20:25,783
that provides information about what shared space they should end up in.

302
00:20:26,263 --> 00:20:28,305
And then we send that information back to the player client,

303
00:20:28,745 --> 00:20:30,026
which can then join that space.

304
00:20:31,117 --> 00:20:33,638
The situation is a little bit more complicated for actors,

305
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:37,401
because we want to give them agency in deciding where they could have the most impact.

306
00:20:38,682 --> 00:20:40,683
But we also don't want to overwhelm them with options,

307
00:20:41,063 --> 00:20:45,967
and so we created this simple interface that lets them choose to enter a shared space, or room,

308
00:20:46,527 --> 00:20:50,910
with players who meet certain criteria, like never having seen a live actor before,

309
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:54,092
or never having seen a specific type of stage act.

310
00:20:56,037 --> 00:21:00,119
Actors can also jump into a space to help out another actor, or they can enter a random

311
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,941
space if they're feeling lucky and they want to try improv-ing for players without really

312
00:21:03,981 --> 00:21:05,482
knowing much about what they're getting into.

313
00:21:09,304 --> 00:21:13,266
The situation behind the scenes is actually pretty similar to the flow for players.

314
00:21:14,047 --> 00:21:18,129
The actor's device asks our backend servers, hey, what room choices do I have?

315
00:21:19,089 --> 00:21:21,090
The servers then verify the actor's identity,

316
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:23,751
and they actually make sure that they're authorized

317
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:24,752
to wield actor powers.

318
00:21:25,412 --> 00:21:27,513
We don't really want hackers or regular players

319
00:21:27,533 --> 00:21:29,594
to have access to all of an actor's special,

320
00:21:29,774 --> 00:21:31,355
almost godlike abilities.

321
00:21:32,936 --> 00:21:34,817
And then the servers fetch a curated list

322
00:21:34,857 --> 00:21:36,938
of categorized spaces that the client

323
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:37,998
can display for the actors.

324
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,561
Once an actor or player has joined a networked space,

325
00:21:44,421 --> 00:21:46,622
how do we support interactions within that space?

326
00:21:48,215 --> 00:21:53,246
From an interaction perspective, players have a limited but versatile toolset for communication,

327
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:59,540
like snapping and multi-hand grabbing, which facilitates sweet interactions like this one.

328
00:22:08,097 --> 00:22:12,723
Behind the scenes, we decided to use a hosted real-time networking solution, Photon, a lot

329
00:22:12,743 --> 00:22:16,728
of you have probably heard of it, and it lets us synchronize a small amount of shared state

330
00:22:17,308 --> 00:22:21,834
per space and per player, like the positions and rotations of each of a player's body parts.

331
00:22:22,742 --> 00:22:27,443
We also use remote procedure calls sometimes for short-lived one-off events that don't

332
00:22:27,463 --> 00:22:31,204
really need to be strictly synchronized when a new player joins the existing space.

333
00:22:31,644 --> 00:22:36,226
So, for example, if a player snaps, that's a very short-term event, and we don't need

334
00:22:36,246 --> 00:22:38,106
that to be synchronized when a new player comes in.

335
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:40,567
We don't care that the snap happened in the past.

336
00:22:43,555 --> 00:22:46,015
Our custom servers are reserved for more higher level

337
00:22:46,035 --> 00:22:49,236
decision making, so matching players into shared spaces,

338
00:22:49,616 --> 00:22:51,536
and also monitoring, because we really want to know

339
00:22:52,056 --> 00:22:53,877
if we need more live actors on staff,

340
00:22:54,697 --> 00:22:56,837
or if we currently have too many live actors

341
00:22:56,977 --> 00:22:58,578
for the amount of players who are currently playing.

342
00:23:00,918 --> 00:23:02,939
This also provides a persistence layer

343
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:05,039
so that we can store information

344
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:07,259
about players' past interactions with live performers,

345
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:09,320
and we can use that to match them into spaces

346
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,620
where we think that they'll have the best experience.

347
00:23:15,377 --> 00:23:18,698
What tools does a live performer have to create magical moments

348
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:20,479
that make players feel special?

349
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,281
Actors in The Under Presents can actually speak with players,

350
00:23:25,501 --> 00:23:26,262
and players can't.

351
00:23:27,082 --> 00:23:30,023
And actors can use their standard improv talents to great effect.

352
00:23:30,844 --> 00:23:34,185
But they also have very powerful abilities that are unique to The Under Presents.

353
00:23:34,805 --> 00:23:36,766
They can shape the virtual environment, for example,

354
00:23:36,806 --> 00:23:38,847
by conjuring objects out of nothing,

355
00:23:39,247 --> 00:23:41,808
or even completely changing the layout of the virtual stage.

356
00:23:42,786 --> 00:23:45,147
These are mostly one-off abilities, and there are a lot of them.

357
00:23:45,568 --> 00:23:50,030
So one of our big challenges has been in creating an interface that could support this flexibility

358
00:23:50,431 --> 00:23:52,432
without getting in the way of the actors actually acting.

359
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:56,895
In some of the early prototypes we had, actors would be super engrossed in the interfaces

360
00:23:56,935 --> 00:24:00,937
and staring at their hands, and that really detracted from the experience of their acting.

361
00:24:03,058 --> 00:24:03,939
In our current iteration...

362
00:24:04,616 --> 00:24:11,040
We're using a radial menu system that allows an actor to select what kind of ability that

363
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,882
they want to use and then trigger it on a button press.

364
00:24:14,403 --> 00:24:18,426
And they don't have to look at their hands throughout any of this process, which creates

365
00:24:18,446 --> 00:24:19,586
a very fluid experience.

366
00:24:20,627 --> 00:24:24,170
However, this is an expert interface, and it requires training to use.

367
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:30,134
The benefit is that it leads to seamless performances that are interwoven with unexpected, delightful

368
00:24:30,174 --> 00:24:30,454
moments.

369
00:24:33,903 --> 00:24:35,884
Actors need to be able to refer back to players

370
00:24:36,324 --> 00:24:37,985
based on what players have done in the past.

371
00:24:38,805 --> 00:24:39,986
In some of our early prototypes,

372
00:24:40,246 --> 00:24:42,587
our live performers had trouble referring to players

373
00:24:43,047 --> 00:24:44,467
because they do look very similar

374
00:24:44,807 --> 00:24:46,108
and they can teleport around,

375
00:24:46,488 --> 00:24:48,389
which can make things very confusing for actors.

376
00:24:49,969 --> 00:24:52,110
That's why we added these colorful labels

377
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:52,930
above players' heads,

378
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:54,231
and you might have noticed those

379
00:24:54,251 --> 00:24:55,251
in some of the earlier images.

380
00:24:55,951 --> 00:24:57,712
These are only visible to the live performers,

381
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:59,573
and they may seem like a small addition,

382
00:25:00,153 --> 00:25:01,413
but it made a world of difference.

383
00:25:03,175 --> 00:25:07,517
Working with Piehole has been great because they've helped us figure out how to bring

384
00:25:07,557 --> 00:25:10,939
immersive performances to VR, and that's something that Tara will talk about now.

385
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,981
Hi, I'm Tara again, and I'm part of Piehole.

386
00:25:17,541 --> 00:25:25,184
I'm a theater director, and Piehole is a live arts collective with five members, and we

387
00:25:25,224 --> 00:25:28,886
make live theater and experimental theater.

388
00:25:29,384 --> 00:25:34,470
That takes place in a lot of different formats and spaces and environments.

389
00:25:35,071 --> 00:25:38,715
So we started out actually as a puppetry, doing a lot of puppetry.

390
00:25:38,775 --> 00:25:39,917
And so you see that on the left.

391
00:25:40,598 --> 00:25:44,202
That's a show that had the audience sitting in one place and looking at a stage.

392
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:47,863
And on the right, you see an installation.

393
00:25:48,224 --> 00:25:50,164
Those are audience members in an installation.

394
00:25:50,204 --> 00:25:53,165
So we play around with a lot of different formats,

395
00:25:53,246 --> 00:25:54,746
sometimes with the audience seated,

396
00:25:54,806 --> 00:25:56,107
sometimes with them roaming,

397
00:25:56,707 --> 00:25:59,508
and sometimes with the performance

398
00:25:59,548 --> 00:26:01,709
basically taking place among the audience.

399
00:26:02,349 --> 00:26:04,250
But in all of the different cases of our work,

400
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:07,411
we're trying to foster agency among the audience

401
00:26:07,491 --> 00:26:10,372
and kind of rewarding a curious viewer.

402
00:26:10,392 --> 00:26:11,232
So just.

403
00:26:12,853 --> 00:26:17,755
A little bit about the puppetry, that is sort of like one side of our background as a company.

404
00:26:17,795 --> 00:26:24,499
We do a lot of what's known as physical theater, which has a strong visual component to it,

405
00:26:24,579 --> 00:26:31,122
puppetry, mask work, and basically work that's very physical and an awareness of the body

406
00:26:31,182 --> 00:26:36,045
and creating kind of efficient storytelling through the body, which has proven to be very

407
00:26:36,205 --> 00:26:39,947
relevant for performing in an animated VR setting.

408
00:26:42,074 --> 00:26:50,558
And we also do a lot of, have done a lot of ensemble-driven, created work in theater.

409
00:26:51,879 --> 00:26:56,101
And so what that means is that our members are not just performers, they are also,

410
00:26:56,181 --> 00:27:00,183
they're generative performers. So they're also writers and they have experience

411
00:27:00,664 --> 00:27:04,806
improvising and they also have experience kind of developing characters.

412
00:27:05,706 --> 00:27:08,929
and the writing for characters in a larger narrative context,

413
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:13,613
which is also something we've drawn on in the process of working on in VR.

414
00:27:14,774 --> 00:27:18,637
So, and that kind of work is often referred to as devised theater.

415
00:27:18,777 --> 00:27:22,160
So devised theater and physical theater are both

416
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:26,424
backgrounds that have proven to be very helpful for this process.

417
00:27:31,819 --> 00:27:37,204
So the first thing I'm going to talk about is just developing content for live encounters, kind of picking up from where Samantha

418
00:27:37,965 --> 00:27:42,909
had left off, and I'm mostly talking here not about the sound boards that she spent a little bit more time with,

419
00:27:43,689 --> 00:27:49,134
but the unscripted, unscripted, I'll put that in quotes, because a

420
00:27:49,194 --> 00:27:56,080
lot of the encounters that we've been developing, they have a set structure, like a checklist that the actor needs to accomplish,

421
00:27:56,100 --> 00:28:00,303
so it has an arc to it, but they're improvising around that structure.

422
00:28:01,204 --> 00:28:22,880
And so to create these moments, first of all, Samantha has provided a kind of bible for the under that has the under mythology or back story in it so that any performer coming into this process can actually know what the world is that they're creating in and it kind of gives them what they need to know to be able to actually improvise.

423
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:29,045
Because if they don't know that back story and don't have a fluidity with it, then they kind of don't have any guidelines.

424
00:28:30,873 --> 00:28:32,054
to develop a character.

425
00:28:32,075 --> 00:28:35,898
And then when we're actually coming up with these live encounters,

426
00:28:36,439 --> 00:28:38,621
the first thing that we really need to ask ourselves is,

427
00:28:38,921 --> 00:28:40,763
what makes something feel live?

428
00:28:41,483 --> 00:28:45,567
And throughout the process, we keep questioning this.

429
00:28:45,647 --> 00:28:47,249
We may have some guesses about,

430
00:28:47,829 --> 00:28:49,831
this seems like it might feel live,

431
00:28:49,851 --> 00:28:51,072
and then you actually try it out,

432
00:28:51,213 --> 00:28:53,375
and you realize that it's really obvious

433
00:28:53,415 --> 00:28:55,156
that the player doesn't realize it's live.

434
00:28:55,677 --> 00:29:00,279
So that's been something that we've had to continue to troubleshoot throughout the process.

435
00:29:00,679 --> 00:29:04,761
But one starting point that we found to be very helpful was to ask the question,

436
00:29:05,401 --> 00:29:07,642
can this happen without a live actor?

437
00:29:07,922 --> 00:29:12,864
And if the answer is yes, then it probably isn't taking advantage of the liveness of the actor.

438
00:29:13,825 --> 00:29:19,727
So that's been a really useful starting point of this can only happen if you have a live actor doing it.

439
00:29:21,961 --> 00:29:25,962
And then once we go from there and we start to develop the actual ideas,

440
00:29:26,362 --> 00:29:33,944
then we identify those key structural points that I was mentioning that will allow the actor to riff off of

441
00:29:34,764 --> 00:29:36,464
while knowing what they need to accomplish.

442
00:29:36,864 --> 00:29:41,285
And then each actor can develop their own voice and their own characterization

443
00:29:42,765 --> 00:29:49,027
so that different characters can inhabit different live encounters or live stage acts.

444
00:29:51,812 --> 00:29:55,656
So some of the challenges that we found working in VR.

445
00:29:57,534 --> 00:29:59,654
that are different from theater, mostly.

446
00:30:00,435 --> 00:30:03,716
One of them is just the experience of being in this

447
00:30:03,896 --> 00:30:07,917
kind of awe-inspiring animated VR setting

448
00:30:07,977 --> 00:30:09,378
can be pretty overwhelming.

449
00:30:09,878 --> 00:30:11,638
So both for the performer,

450
00:30:11,738 --> 00:30:13,899
who may not have much experience in VR,

451
00:30:14,339 --> 00:30:17,200
going in there, just being in there

452
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,680
can be such an overwhelming experience

453
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,941
that it takes them a little time to find their footing

454
00:30:21,641 --> 00:30:24,282
to be able to have that kind of fluidity and flexibility

455
00:30:24,302 --> 00:30:25,823
to do all the things they need to do in there.

456
00:30:26,543 --> 00:30:33,109
And it also can be overwhelming in a way for a player going in there who just sees this space that's

457
00:30:33,189 --> 00:30:38,734
expansive and they just, you know, want to go and see like this is a view from the stage.

458
00:30:39,375 --> 00:30:39,555
And

459
00:30:40,416 --> 00:30:44,320
so the audience's kind of would be where those stars and the star and square.

460
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:47,662
The first prompt states that this is a game development transcript.

461
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:03,011
And another challenge, if you're coming from theater,

462
00:31:03,331 --> 00:31:06,412
is just the audience behaves differently

463
00:31:06,452 --> 00:31:08,072
than they would in a VR experience

464
00:31:08,092 --> 00:31:09,693
than they would in a theater experience.

465
00:31:10,253 --> 00:31:14,035
So here we see the audience throwing onions at the stage.

466
00:31:14,935 --> 00:31:18,156
And a theater audience is just typically more reverent

467
00:31:18,596 --> 00:31:19,977
to the performers.

468
00:31:20,437 --> 00:31:22,257
And that's, you know, there's a lot of different kinds

469
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,518
of theater, things that can be called theater,

470
00:31:24,578 --> 00:31:26,819
and some where people are a lot more respectful

471
00:31:26,879 --> 00:31:29,180
and maybe some where they're more talkative, you know.

472
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:38,389
There's a whole range, but just generally speaking, in VR, or I think probably because of the gaming tendencies and all of that,

473
00:31:38,989 --> 00:31:45,015
it's not like you're just being a jerk by throwing things. That's actually a way to test the limits of the space.

474
00:31:45,095 --> 00:31:51,422
It's like a legitimate way to encounter this space, especially if you're being told that there's live elements.

475
00:31:52,222 --> 00:31:53,103
You want to test that.

476
00:31:53,924 --> 00:32:01,187
So just understanding that the players coming in are not necessarily coming in there just to see you, the actor, do their thing.

477
00:32:01,567 --> 00:32:08,490
They have, yeah, so they're testing the limits and it's a different kind of, it's a different way of kind of commanding the space.

478
00:32:09,271 --> 00:32:16,394
So one of the things we so we can draw from some theater techniques to think about how to command the space as a performer

479
00:32:17,195 --> 00:32:23,658
and that includes physical and vocal techniques like I was saying the physical theater background is helpful for that and just things like

480
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:26,420
having using your body in specific

481
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:32,883
Ways to kind of create suspense or command control through contrasting rhythm

482
00:32:33,964 --> 00:32:35,265
And same thing with the voice

483
00:32:36,125 --> 00:32:38,627
Using different volume and different rhythm to kind of

484
00:32:41,149 --> 00:32:49,495
Pregnant pauses, etc. to kind of draw people's attention in and break up the the rhythms that you're playing around with.

485
00:32:49,775 --> 00:32:56,400
And those actually have been very helpful, especially for the live stage acts. And then for the one-on-one encounters,

486
00:32:57,181 --> 00:33:02,785
also thinking about the use of just volume to create a more intimate experience and draw people in

487
00:33:02,905 --> 00:33:08,108
versus when you're doing a live stage act and you want to reach the person who's running away or whatever.

488
00:33:09,248 --> 00:33:16,433
And then we can also turn to theater live performance formats like drag, cabaret, burlesque,

489
00:33:17,174 --> 00:33:23,839
and comedians, live comedy, and how they do crowd work and handle an audience.

490
00:33:24,259 --> 00:33:31,745
So this is Taylor Mac, who's like a superstar drag performer, and his advice is, he talks about how,

491
00:33:32,286 --> 00:33:35,548
you know, in a drag show, you never know who you're going to be encountering.

492
00:33:35,969 --> 00:33:40,974
You might have an audience member who just goes really rogue or is antagonistic or something.

493
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:46,160
And so he always says, you know, if that person is being rogue, if you just sit there and

494
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:49,183
try to like ignore that, then they're going to win.

495
00:33:49,243 --> 00:33:51,405
Their spotlight's always going to be brighter than yours.

496
00:33:51,846 --> 00:33:54,909
But if you, and if you try to kind of combat it and, you know.

497
00:33:56,605 --> 00:34:01,307
And so, if you can kind of take on that antagonistic relationship with them, again, their spotlight's

498
00:34:01,327 --> 00:34:03,228
going to be brighter than yours, and they're going to win.

499
00:34:03,488 --> 00:34:09,051
So, what he says to do, and I'm totally paraphrasing, but it's like you go and you stand inside

500
00:34:09,071 --> 00:34:12,952
of their spotlight, and you kind of scoop them into what you're doing, and you make

501
00:34:13,012 --> 00:34:14,833
them part of your act, and then you win.

502
00:34:15,733 --> 00:34:20,515
And that's actually a principle that the performers have really been drawing from when they're

503
00:34:20,535 --> 00:34:20,896
doing that.

504
00:34:22,324 --> 00:34:30,069
Especially the live stage act, but actually in the live one-on-one encounters too, you're trying to have this intimate moment and this particular player just wants to like

505
00:34:30,589 --> 00:34:33,271
swoop around and you know not paying attention to you.

506
00:34:33,331 --> 00:34:38,114
So you have to know you can't just like keep insisting that they do. You kind of have to

507
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:39,755
navigate that.

508
00:34:40,293 --> 00:34:41,274
a little more artfully.

509
00:34:43,095 --> 00:34:48,038
And then on top of those theater techniques, we've been working with Tender Claws to kind

510
00:34:48,098 --> 00:34:53,661
of establish a power dynamic that helps the actor command more control, considering all

511
00:34:53,702 --> 00:34:55,122
those challenges I was mentioning.

512
00:34:55,463 --> 00:35:00,226
So the technical interface and the kind of superpowers that the performers have, like

513
00:35:00,246 --> 00:35:03,208
the ability to teleport a player or make objects appear.

514
00:35:04,488 --> 00:35:10,032
All of those things and the fact that the live actors have the ability to speak and the players don't

515
00:35:10,552 --> 00:35:16,235
Also helps them kind of have a little bit of an edge on the players in terms of commanding space

516
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:21,358
And another key element here, I mean I'm talking about these improvised encounters

517
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:26,561
And so I think a lot of people when they hear about improvisation, they're like, oh you don't need to rehearse, right?

518
00:35:27,002 --> 00:35:33,166
But there's many reasons why actually improvising these acts requires even more rehearsal.

519
00:35:33,186 --> 00:35:37,749
Because you need to not only be comfortable with the interface as Julian was describing,

520
00:35:38,089 --> 00:35:41,712
but you also need to be able to have such a fluidity with the structure,

521
00:35:42,232 --> 00:35:44,594
and with the world and mythology of the under,

522
00:35:45,094 --> 00:35:46,755
and this character that you're developing,

523
00:35:47,056 --> 00:35:49,077
that you can change course at any moment.

524
00:35:50,018 --> 00:35:51,759
If you don't have that rehearsal time,

525
00:35:52,259 --> 00:35:59,147
Then you'll just be trying to fit your script and you won't be able to have the fluidity to be responsive to all the changes happening around you.

526
00:35:59,207 --> 00:36:00,188
It's different every time.

527
00:36:01,389 --> 00:36:08,597
And then the other key thing that we have discovered through this process is creating a balance between...

528
00:36:09,638 --> 00:36:12,321
What I've been talking about so far are ways for the actor to kind of...

529
00:36:12,751 --> 00:36:15,453
have control and command and draw attention.

530
00:36:15,934 --> 00:36:19,456
But then the other side of that coin is to also let go.

531
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:23,079
And to allow the, so you wanna be able to acknowledge

532
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:24,901
the players and make them feel seen

533
00:36:24,961 --> 00:36:26,342
and respond to what they're doing.

534
00:36:26,742 --> 00:36:29,144
But you also don't wanna insist that they pay attention

535
00:36:29,164 --> 00:36:30,145
to you the whole time.

536
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:33,567
So, because like we've all been saying,

537
00:36:33,667 --> 00:36:36,350
like discovery and exploring the space

538
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:37,911
are all really legitimate ways

539
00:36:37,991 --> 00:36:39,572
of inhabiting this experience.

540
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:47,196
So, you know, we want to be able to allow people to explore and run away from you if that's what they want to do.

541
00:36:48,197 --> 00:36:54,040
But still acknowledging it so that it's clear that we see you and I'm a live person who sees what you're doing.

542
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:58,582
And then there's other fun ways of kind of teaching the players how to behave.

543
00:36:59,222 --> 00:37:03,667
And that kind of allow you to be either reverent or subversive.

544
00:37:03,767 --> 00:37:11,474
So, for example, the live stage hosts are able to place the players in a cage.

545
00:37:12,575 --> 00:37:16,079
And so that's kind of like a punishment, like for being bad.

546
00:37:16,099 --> 00:37:20,984
You know, if you throw something at the stage, the live stage host can say.

547
00:37:21,664 --> 00:37:23,465
If you do that again, I'm going to put you in the cage.

548
00:37:23,525 --> 00:37:25,685
And of course, then the player will most likely do it again.

549
00:37:25,705 --> 00:37:26,966
And then they go in the cage.

550
00:37:27,246 --> 00:37:30,167
So it's like a punishment, but it's also kind of a reward,

551
00:37:30,287 --> 00:37:32,928
because you get to see this other view of the space.

552
00:37:33,088 --> 00:37:35,388
And so it's just ways of kind of,

553
00:37:35,589 --> 00:37:36,769
and that's a really good example,

554
00:37:36,829 --> 00:37:39,010
I think, of putting the spotlight on the person

555
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:40,230
and scooping them in.

556
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:43,031
So you're punishing them, but it's just

557
00:37:43,091 --> 00:37:44,531
another layer of the experience.

558
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:55,138
And then, so at Sundance we did what in theater we refer to as previews, which is just the first time you encounter an audience.

559
00:37:55,278 --> 00:37:59,260
And so this gave us a chance to really explore different types of audience behavior.

560
00:38:00,281 --> 00:38:05,684
So one of the things that we noticed is that sometimes, yes, you have these people who just want to throw things the whole time.

561
00:38:06,224 --> 00:38:11,488
And sometimes the host would react to that by also throwing things.

562
00:38:11,548 --> 00:38:13,609
And now we're throwing things. That's what we do now.

563
00:38:15,272 --> 00:38:19,675
But then you also would have these audiences who are really interested in just hugging everyone.

564
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:22,937
And just so that's why I have this huggers versus throwers.

565
00:38:23,337 --> 00:38:27,899
And this is just all these different ways that the players have found to interact with each other.

566
00:38:27,939 --> 00:38:30,401
And sometimes you have a group that's actually shy.

567
00:38:30,421 --> 00:38:34,903
And if you don't have one player in there that's more outgoing to kind

568
00:38:34,963 --> 00:38:40,026
of teach the other players how to be outgoing, then you might need the live actor

569
00:38:40,106 --> 00:38:42,467
to help encourage those kinds of interactions.

570
00:38:43,718 --> 00:38:55,893
And then again, another thing we discovered was the tendency for sometimes you would notice that a player is trying to say something verbally and that's not a power they have.

571
00:38:56,313 --> 00:39:01,199
So then the actors would adjust what they were saying in the subsequent performances so that they wouldn't...

572
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:19,610
It would take more advantage of the verbal tools that the players actually do have, like snapping, or they can nod, or pick things up and hand things to each other, and not ask questions or give them prompts that would make them think they're supposed to give you some kind of essay in response, or monologue, or whatever.

573
00:39:21,417 --> 00:39:26,381
And then, and once again, and I think I've already mentioned this, but doing the previews

574
00:39:26,481 --> 00:39:32,806
also really showed, gave us a full experience of when, you know, you think you have this

575
00:39:32,846 --> 00:39:37,810
seven-minute live act that has all these points, but because of the other circumstances of

576
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:41,613
what the players have experienced and what they haven't experienced, you might just have

577
00:39:41,653 --> 00:39:45,696
to cut it short halfway through and completely change course and say, okay, well, that's

578
00:39:45,736 --> 00:39:46,357
it for this show.

579
00:39:46,397 --> 00:39:49,299
And then you, you, you whisk off.

580
00:39:50,152 --> 00:39:56,794
Turn into another character so that you can then be there to have a live encounter with some other player.

581
00:39:57,194 --> 00:40:03,957
So just having that kind of versatility and flexibility becomes really key in this setting.

582
00:40:04,557 --> 00:40:10,839
So then now I'm going to turn it over to Tanya who's going to talk about production and the logistics of everything, making all this happen.

583
00:40:16,092 --> 00:40:19,633
I'm Tania Leal Soto, I'm the producer for Tender Claws.

584
00:40:20,354 --> 00:40:23,515
And logistically, how does it happen?

585
00:40:24,616 --> 00:40:26,016
I'm briefly gonna talk about

586
00:40:26,597 --> 00:40:28,137
organizing multidisciplinary teams,

587
00:40:28,718 --> 00:40:31,399
developing workflows for acting virtual spaces,

588
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,240
the glorious human factor,

589
00:40:34,901 --> 00:40:36,181
and I'm gonna close with

590
00:40:36,441 --> 00:40:38,582
why is this not a location-based experience?

591
00:40:39,903 --> 00:40:42,124
So organizing multidisciplinary teams.

592
00:40:43,012 --> 00:40:47,836
One fun thing that we haven't mentioned here is that Tender Claws is based in Los Angeles

593
00:40:48,236 --> 00:40:50,738
while Pie Hole is based in New York City.

594
00:40:51,618 --> 00:40:55,341
So this in on itself made it interesting.

595
00:40:55,861 --> 00:41:00,024
We had to be really careful when coordinating all the communications.

596
00:41:01,485 --> 00:41:01,846
But also

597
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,503
Not only the communication, but the way to translate the terms,

598
00:41:06,543 --> 00:41:10,967
you know, the terms that developers use versus the terms that the actors were using,

599
00:41:11,047 --> 00:41:13,609
or even like things that Samantha would be creating.

600
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:17,352
And we had to agree in naming conventions,

601
00:41:18,674 --> 00:41:21,216
because our teams are not cut with the same scissors.

602
00:41:23,085 --> 00:41:26,366
So within Tender Claws, we all have different backgrounds.

603
00:41:26,406 --> 00:41:29,087
We come from fine arts, from film, from programming,

604
00:41:29,147 --> 00:41:31,148
from puppeteering, theater.

605
00:41:31,828 --> 00:41:36,390
And we all wear many hats, all the hats sometimes.

606
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:38,731
This is not a hat.

607
00:41:39,591 --> 00:41:41,652
The combination of all these disciplines

608
00:41:41,792 --> 00:41:43,032
and the collaboration with Pyho.

609
00:41:43,512 --> 00:41:47,874
helped everybody in these teams broaden their perspectives.

610
00:41:48,494 --> 00:41:50,815
We were able to get different vantage points

611
00:41:50,915 --> 00:41:52,175
on different situations.

612
00:41:52,615 --> 00:41:56,317
It was very beneficial to have somebody attack

613
00:41:56,357 --> 00:41:58,157
the same problem from a different angle.

614
00:41:59,878 --> 00:42:03,579
Our first organizational stone that you already heard about

615
00:42:03,639 --> 00:42:06,320
was the Bible that Samantha created.

616
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:09,241
And thanks to that, we were able to allow

617
00:42:09,321 --> 00:42:11,922
for different departments to continue to add to this world.

618
00:42:13,299 --> 00:42:19,582
A good example of this was understanding the layout of the stage and how these would affect

619
00:42:19,622 --> 00:42:22,043
the live actors' interactions with the players.

620
00:42:22,683 --> 00:42:28,006
So for example, our art director, Carter, looked for a bunch of reference on stages.

621
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:37,330
And then Jeff from Pyho would draw this elaborated sketch informing us of the actual layout of

622
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:37,730
the theater.

623
00:42:39,732 --> 00:42:42,036
We had these discussions on ideas

624
00:42:42,116 --> 00:42:43,939
of how these spaces could be useful.

625
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:46,443
How could we use them to create moments

626
00:42:47,003 --> 00:42:49,728
with the live hosts and moments with the actors

627
00:42:49,788 --> 00:42:51,110
doing the one-on-one encounters.

628
00:42:51,991 --> 00:42:52,952
And then.

629
00:42:54,120 --> 00:43:01,227
Our creative director, Danny, would start working with the team on potential interactions.

630
00:43:02,469 --> 00:43:05,532
Until we finally had our glorious stage.

631
00:43:06,353 --> 00:43:12,219
All this crowd-sourced information also helped make decisions to allow both the player and

632
00:43:12,259 --> 00:43:14,401
the live actors to have some agency.

633
00:43:15,062 --> 00:43:20,725
For example, a decision was made to not allow the players on stage unless the live host invites them.

634
00:43:21,506 --> 00:43:28,130
And this way the live host can still control their space and have the ability to use this power to make the player feel special.

635
00:43:30,215 --> 00:43:31,878
So then, developing workflows.

636
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:39,087
This has been an ongoing process and will help us when we actually scale this project

637
00:43:39,427 --> 00:43:41,250
because we're going to have to train actors.

638
00:43:43,432 --> 00:43:48,479
And the reality is we've realized that we need to train them in VR, in the virtual world.

639
00:43:49,220 --> 00:44:01,424
Thankfully, the untethered nature of the headsets that we've been developing in has allowed us to actually rehearse in the headset, in the virtual world, where different people can log in.

640
00:44:02,365 --> 00:44:09,527
Some of the actors will be training. Tara will also be there giving notes. Samantha will be there giving notes. It's been a very interesting experience.

641
00:44:12,539 --> 00:44:17,282
But because of what we soon had to consider, the human factor,

642
00:44:18,463 --> 00:44:21,445
we started having a lot of interesting findings.

643
00:44:22,306 --> 00:44:26,048
One which Tara already mentioned, which is like, when the actors come into this world,

644
00:44:26,508 --> 00:44:30,231
settling into the VR space and into the characters' physicality

645
00:44:30,371 --> 00:44:33,053
is something that varies from person to person.

646
00:44:34,214 --> 00:44:38,235
Embodying characters means puppeteering different sized bodies,

647
00:44:39,235 --> 00:44:42,056
and the movements sometimes have to be like really exaggerated,

648
00:44:42,577 --> 00:44:47,678
and you can only understand how to move your character in the space in VR. For example,

649
00:44:48,399 --> 00:44:50,419
one of our characters, the cook,

650
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:53,420
sorry,

651
00:44:58,702 --> 00:45:03,604
the cook is a very large character, and everybody who embodies it, you know, they have to like do like this.

652
00:45:04,375 --> 00:45:11,563
Very, very large gestures, which we realize it becomes really, really physical.

653
00:45:13,185 --> 00:45:20,454
So some of the learnings from our previews, which Tara talked briefly about, essentially,

654
00:45:20,714 --> 00:45:22,296
again, we had to consider the human factor.

655
00:45:23,003 --> 00:45:28,285
One interesting thing was how do we do actor shifts?

656
00:45:28,345 --> 00:45:30,025
How long are these people going to be acting?

657
00:45:31,265 --> 00:45:33,646
And we looked to SAG, to the Screen Actor Guild,

658
00:45:34,166 --> 00:45:35,966
and Equity, which is a theater union,

659
00:45:36,387 --> 00:45:38,947
but neither really reflected the work

660
00:45:39,267 --> 00:45:40,788
that these actors were doing.

661
00:45:41,808 --> 00:45:44,168
SAG actors can be on set for 12 hours,

662
00:45:44,588 --> 00:45:48,329
but at the same time, they have a lot of breaks

663
00:45:48,389 --> 00:45:51,110
every time that they're setting the camera, changing scenes.

664
00:45:51,730 --> 00:45:52,410
These actors are...

665
00:45:54,732 --> 00:45:59,756
and in equity, they're meant to have 10 minute breaks every hour and 20 minutes.

666
00:46:00,356 --> 00:46:04,159
But all of this really doesn't mean anything for the way our actors were working.

667
00:46:04,179 --> 00:46:07,602
Hello and welcome to Thunder Down at the Under.

668
00:46:07,842 --> 00:46:12,206
My name is Jimmy Stringbean Salami, Ohio, and I'm here to show you a good time.

669
00:46:12,226 --> 00:46:16,409
If you know how to play by the rules, I know how to give a show to you.

670
00:46:18,937 --> 00:46:19,398
Sorry.

671
00:46:20,479 --> 00:46:27,929
Even during our rehearsals, one of the findings was understanding the physical and the mental demand for these actors.

672
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:32,915
The live hosts have to be engaging, loud, they have to be trying to...

673
00:46:34,691 --> 00:46:39,255
track the attention of the players and at the same time interact with the rest of the audience.

674
00:46:40,116 --> 00:46:47,463
Actors doing one-on-ones or possessing NPCs have to be in content state of alert and in character while they're in this virtual world

675
00:46:47,724 --> 00:46:50,406
waiting for the opportunity to start a new adventure with somebody.

676
00:46:51,167 --> 00:46:57,313
But the reality is you start losing track of the time when you're in the space and the passage of time is really different.

677
00:46:58,462 --> 00:47:03,804
So we settle when we're doing the previews on two-hour shifts for actors.

678
00:47:04,144 --> 00:47:09,186
It would be like 30 minutes log in, a five-minute break, 30 minutes log in, a larger 10-minute

679
00:47:09,206 --> 00:47:11,107
break at the hour, and then again another hour.

680
00:47:11,847 --> 00:47:12,967
And then we change actors.

681
00:47:13,308 --> 00:47:15,428
And these seem to work really good.

682
00:47:18,850 --> 00:47:20,530
So the last thing I'm going to talk about...

683
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:26,124
is why we choose to do this non-location-based.

684
00:47:26,824 --> 00:47:30,507
If you know our work, Tender Claws creates long-form narrative projects,

685
00:47:30,987 --> 00:47:33,949
and we're always looking for ways to encourage exploration

686
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:38,232
and create the desire to come back and find out more about the world and the narrative.

687
00:47:39,133 --> 00:47:43,054
In The Honor Presents, we want to create a space where people want to come back to.

688
00:47:43,494 --> 00:47:47,976
To be able to scale the experience, we will have a loop of pre-recorded acts,

689
00:47:48,396 --> 00:47:52,917
so that when players come into the world, there's always something exciting happening.

690
00:47:54,338 --> 00:47:58,119
The Honor will run without dependency of the live host on stage.

691
00:47:58,519 --> 00:47:59,079
However,

692
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:04,689
The part of the magic will be to find yourself interacting with a live host

693
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:09,158
or being swept away by an actor for a more intimate moment.

694
00:48:09,915 --> 00:48:12,077
But you won't really know when that is going to happen.

695
00:48:14,519 --> 00:48:16,360
Finally, our takeaways.

696
00:48:17,201 --> 00:48:18,982
The way we've been trying to bring live actors

697
00:48:19,383 --> 00:48:21,965
into these spaces, create modular scripts,

698
00:48:22,245 --> 00:48:25,287
optimize responsiveness, designing narrative

699
00:48:25,367 --> 00:48:27,449
to maximize live actor resources,

700
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:30,131
build infrastructure to support objectives,

701
00:48:31,092 --> 00:48:33,214
make players feel seen, then set them free,

702
00:48:33,874 --> 00:48:36,356
and consider the human factor when training actors

703
00:48:36,396 --> 00:48:37,757
to perform in virtual spaces.

704
00:48:40,209 --> 00:48:42,354
So that's all for today.

705
00:48:42,374 --> 00:48:44,640
We're going to open it up for questions.

706
00:48:45,462 --> 00:48:46,745
Anybody want to ask us anything?

707
00:48:46,765 --> 00:48:48,388
Thank you very much.

708
00:48:56,457 --> 00:48:57,378
So I ask a question.

709
00:48:58,318 --> 00:49:00,439
I find, I think it's really interesting when you talk about

710
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:05,001
trying to encourage players to understand that they're dealing with a real actor.

711
00:49:05,681 --> 00:49:09,483
And from a game design and narrative design perspective,

712
00:49:09,563 --> 00:49:11,244
can you guys elaborate on that at all?

713
00:49:11,704 --> 00:49:15,365
As far as like, what tools are you giving

714
00:49:15,425 --> 00:49:17,146
or how are you directing the player

715
00:49:17,666 --> 00:49:20,227
in ways that give them utility

716
00:49:20,288 --> 00:49:22,288
to discover that they're dealing with a live actor?

717
00:49:24,106 --> 00:49:36,452
Part of that is actually in the difficulty of something that's more AI and more of an

718
00:49:36,552 --> 00:49:43,095
NPC to be exactly responsive in particular ways that you know is not possible by the

719
00:49:43,155 --> 00:49:44,375
presence and the movement.

720
00:49:45,016 --> 00:49:48,997
And like that kind of the change of the discovery of how that happens.

721
00:49:50,038 --> 00:49:51,899
And in there's actually.

722
00:49:53,079 --> 00:49:58,145
Not all of the one-on-one encounters are already pre-recorded voice. A lot of them are live voice.

723
00:49:59,186 --> 00:50:01,608
So that actually, you know, can contribute significantly.

724
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:09,517
And being able to call very one-to-one onto what the player has done and make references to things they've already done previously

725
00:50:09,537 --> 00:50:11,459
is one of the ways we're doing it.

726
00:50:11,917 --> 00:50:17,320
Right, like so if a player picked up an object and then dropped it and then picked it up again,

727
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:23,003
then to like really, oh you who dropped the martini glass and can't keep it in your hand,

728
00:50:23,063 --> 00:50:27,265
maybe you've had too many already. You know, like just finding ways to be really specific

729
00:50:27,365 --> 00:50:30,647
to that player and what they've done helps them.

730
00:50:31,428 --> 00:50:40,847
There's no way that that player's actions have been done consistently enough for that

731
00:50:40,888 --> 00:50:42,511
to have been pre-programmed or something.

732
00:50:45,968 --> 00:50:49,249
This is probably a question that would be answered by actually playing the game, but

733
00:50:49,349 --> 00:50:55,372
I'm just trying to get clarity on the balance between the soundboard and the live dialogue.

734
00:50:56,112 --> 00:51:00,194
If people have the soundboard and the reason for that was to have a consistency of voice

735
00:51:00,214 --> 00:51:05,276
with the prerecorded, what do you do with the voice when it's live and how do you balance

736
00:51:05,296 --> 00:51:05,436
that?

737
00:51:05,716 --> 00:51:06,096
Can you help?

738
00:51:06,336 --> 00:51:10,339
Yeah, I'd say like 80% of all the live encounters are not soundboards.

739
00:51:10,939 --> 00:51:17,124
It's a very specific case for like very specific NPCs that the player already has relationships with in the game.

740
00:51:19,625 --> 00:51:24,829
So when you get to the soundboard, it's a thing where it may not...

741
00:51:26,791 --> 00:51:29,633
You may not realize it can be played by different actors.

742
00:51:32,101 --> 00:51:34,102
So specific characters have sound boards,

743
00:51:34,362 --> 00:51:35,782
and other characters are created

744
00:51:35,822 --> 00:51:37,143
by each actor in the moment.

745
00:51:37,463 --> 00:51:38,303
OK, got it.

746
00:51:38,403 --> 00:51:38,663
Cool.

747
00:51:39,163 --> 00:51:39,424
Thank you.

748
00:51:42,325 --> 00:51:47,046
Yeah, so you mentioned that players can talk.

749
00:51:47,166 --> 00:51:50,547
I was wondering if that was a decision from the get-go,

750
00:51:50,667 --> 00:51:53,428
if you had experimented with letting the players talk.

751
00:51:55,948 --> 00:51:57,368
I think we can all talk to this.

752
00:51:57,408 --> 00:52:00,129
That was a decision from the get-go for many reasons.

753
00:52:00,709 --> 00:52:05,111
One of it is we were inspired by Journey and our decision to, you know, the kind of responsiveness

754
00:52:05,151 --> 00:52:08,411
of like the emergent types of play and gesture and behavior that comes from that.

755
00:52:10,172 --> 00:52:14,413
And we're also, we wanted to give like power to the actors as well.

756
00:52:16,212 --> 00:52:21,335
Yeah, it allows the actor to guide the experience a little more fully.

757
00:52:22,136 --> 00:52:27,819
Because as soon as the players are able to speak, then it's like a whole other narrative emerges,

758
00:52:27,919 --> 00:52:30,340
and they bring in their own real-life history.

759
00:52:30,461 --> 00:52:35,103
And there's so many narrative components to this experience,

760
00:52:35,143 --> 00:52:37,305
and it's such a unique world with its own rules.

761
00:52:38,025 --> 00:52:43,491
That having the players bring in a whole personal history,

762
00:52:44,251 --> 00:52:46,874
it makes it a lot harder to guide them through the narrative.

763
00:52:46,894 --> 00:52:49,477
And also from a strictly technical perspective,

764
00:52:49,517 --> 00:52:53,140
it's a lot easier to have bandwidth for a single person talking at a time

765
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,442
than every player on stage at the same time.

766
00:52:58,045 --> 00:52:59,707
You all know how bad Skype calls are.

767
00:52:59,727 --> 00:53:01,629
Try imagining that in VR.

768
00:53:03,029 --> 00:53:07,911
One other thing, too, like I think a lot of people, at least in the theater world,

769
00:53:07,971 --> 00:53:10,952
like when you think about interactive stuff or where you're being put on the

770
00:53:11,012 --> 00:53:16,994
spot, I think a lot of us feel like, oh don't make me talk. So I think what we

771
00:53:17,034 --> 00:53:22,756
found in the preview period with this was like a lot of people actually found

772
00:53:22,796 --> 00:53:23,656
it really freeing.

773
00:53:24,076 --> 00:53:30,301
to not have to say things and to be able to, like, it kind of opened them up to take more risks and to participate more

774
00:53:30,361 --> 00:53:35,646
because then they didn't have to, like, worry about saying something clever or something like that.

775
00:53:35,806 --> 00:53:40,570
So, and I know that that's a taste thing, but I've personally found that freeing.

776
00:53:43,332 --> 00:53:46,735
The same basic question, so just as a quick follow-up, do you see yourselves...

777
00:53:47,533 --> 00:53:51,065
ever exploring that space where players speak, or do you think it's just like

778
00:53:51,848 --> 00:53:54,136
the challenges are too high and it's not really something you would...

779
00:53:55,684 --> 00:54:00,347
I think that something that Danny, who's our creative director, also mentions too is the

780
00:54:00,427 --> 00:54:06,730
decision for the players to not be able to speak is also coming from giving them different

781
00:54:06,770 --> 00:54:07,791
ways to explore the world.

782
00:54:08,552 --> 00:54:12,354
And that is something that we are actively trying to do.

783
00:54:12,634 --> 00:54:18,678
So you know, like they have these things like the snapping or holding hands, and it's really

784
00:54:18,718 --> 00:54:21,720
like a way to create ways for them to explore.

785
00:54:23,011 --> 00:54:23,913
I think there's plenty.

786
00:54:23,953 --> 00:54:25,997
I mean, we're trying to do a very different thing

787
00:54:26,017 --> 00:54:28,702
than alt space in terms of artistic intention.

788
00:54:36,388 --> 00:54:40,810
So fantastic. I love not being able to speak in sleep no more.

789
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:43,891
I mean, I think that's such a wonderful part of that experience.

790
00:54:43,911 --> 00:54:47,292
So don't let the players speak.

791
00:54:47,813 --> 00:54:52,175
My question is, I guess mostly for Tara, but maybe for everybody in particular,

792
00:54:52,215 --> 00:54:56,797
like how did you approach movement for the performers, you know,

793
00:54:56,957 --> 00:55:02,039
in terms of, well, just their performance and like veering on dance?

794
00:55:03,113 --> 00:55:08,777
Yeah, I mean, I think it really felt for me connected to our work in puppetry and mask,

795
00:55:08,837 --> 00:55:15,241
but thinking about efficiency of gesture, big enough gestures that can read and things

796
00:55:15,281 --> 00:55:16,282
can get really muddy.

797
00:55:16,302 --> 00:55:22,186
I think what we found when we were doing motion capture for the pre-recorded stuff, it's amazing

798
00:55:22,226 --> 00:55:27,529
how quickly, how many little gestures the setup picks up.

799
00:55:27,889 --> 00:55:28,249
And so.

800
00:55:28,910 --> 00:55:34,473
We realized that we just kind of had to pare things down in a way, because if it got too muddy,

801
00:55:36,775 --> 00:55:41,818
or if it got too, yeah, if it wasn't efficient, if the gestures weren't efficient enough,

802
00:55:41,858 --> 00:55:47,221
it would start to get muddy and blurry and it would be harder to kind of, it wasn't as legible basically.

803
00:55:49,502 --> 00:56:11,456
Yeah. And then with the live encounter interface, it's a little bit different than the motion capture because you don't have like sensors on the body. So, yeah, so that and then there's also the like interface you have to interact with and all of that. But it's a lot more in the upper body and a lot less in the in the lower body, I'll say.

804
00:56:12,156 --> 00:56:18,561
Part of one of the aspects of the scalability is we're using quests that are dispersed over like hubs in various places.

805
00:56:18,621 --> 00:56:23,225
So it's the it's not like motion capture. It's using just the quests for the movement.

806
00:56:24,145 --> 00:56:29,750
Yeah, so that's why we don't really have their legs in the picture so much. I mean they can walk.

807
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:31,591
There's creative decisions we make around that.

808
00:56:35,113 --> 00:56:37,395
This is also a question more for Tara.

809
00:56:38,336 --> 00:56:41,540
Being so involved purely with live performance,

810
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:43,702
how did you find Tender Claws?

811
00:56:43,982 --> 00:56:45,564
And how did you realize that your future

812
00:56:45,604 --> 00:56:46,886
was with this VR tech?

813
00:56:49,494 --> 00:56:51,795
Like how did we, how did I meet Tender Claws?

814
00:56:51,835 --> 00:56:52,255
Yeah, sure.

815
00:56:53,015 --> 00:56:57,036
Well, we've known each other for a long time and we've actually been working in parallel

816
00:56:57,076 --> 00:56:58,857
with one another for over a decade.

817
00:56:59,297 --> 00:57:03,958
And so we've actually always had a shared sensibility and we've also all, we're both

818
00:57:04,018 --> 00:57:08,079
very interdisciplinary companies with members with all different backgrounds.

819
00:57:08,159 --> 00:57:12,861
It's just that we're often bringing people from different disciplines into theater and

820
00:57:12,901 --> 00:57:16,041
they're doing this more in interactive media of different types.

821
00:57:16,502 --> 00:57:22,307
So it's kind of funny that this is our first full-on collaboration.

822
00:57:24,388 --> 00:57:28,832
But it was exciting for us to do what we were always doing with other artists,

823
00:57:28,852 --> 00:57:34,337
bringing them into our home, and to actually bring our stuff to another discipline.

824
00:57:35,378 --> 00:57:36,419
Thank you.

825
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:39,621
We pitched and created this project explicitly to work with them.

826
00:57:41,623 --> 00:57:41,863
Thank you.

827
00:57:47,902 --> 00:57:50,985
How do you plan on maintaining a project like this?

828
00:57:51,606 --> 00:57:53,828
Like, obviously you have to have live actors in there,

829
00:57:54,448 --> 00:57:57,792
and then supporting players from different time zones

830
00:57:58,272 --> 00:58:01,435
across the world, possibly, and then, like, the longevity of it.

831
00:58:02,957 --> 00:58:04,979
Like, how do you plan on tackling that?

832
00:58:05,505 --> 00:58:08,447
Yeah, that's a complicated question with a lot of different stages.

833
00:58:08,467 --> 00:58:10,508
I think we can all speak a little to it.

834
00:58:11,649 --> 00:58:14,551
We're going to treat this like runs of theater.

835
00:58:15,271 --> 00:58:18,774
We're going to have essentially at the beginning like a four-month live service.

836
00:58:19,574 --> 00:58:22,736
And we'll see how that turns out.

837
00:58:23,337 --> 00:58:24,337
As we were saying, the...

838
00:58:25,198 --> 00:58:29,600
The whole game can run on its own without the live actors.

839
00:58:30,981 --> 00:58:33,643
But depending on how things start playing out,

840
00:58:33,703 --> 00:58:35,343
we'll have different runs or not.

841
00:58:36,164 --> 00:58:38,945
If it gets super popular, then we can pay a lot of more actors.

842
00:58:40,346 --> 00:58:43,648
But we are considering for both things, the live service

843
00:58:43,868 --> 00:58:45,349
and what happens when that's not there.

844
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:51,604
I think Tanya already mentioned this, but the idea right now is not to have live actors available 24-7.

845
00:58:52,224 --> 00:58:57,747
So, as a player you would go in not knowing whether you'll get a live actor or not, a live encounter or not.

846
00:58:57,807 --> 00:58:59,828
So that's part of the experience.

847
00:58:59,849 --> 00:59:04,751
I think right now we're testing on North American time zones.

848
00:59:05,312 --> 00:59:09,255
So probably from 10 AM to like X amount, like 9 AM.

849
00:59:09,775 --> 00:59:15,940
And we can use data from VVR to kind of work with scheduling.

850
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:19,663
But we do want, there will be multiple, more than one actor

851
00:59:19,683 --> 00:59:20,623
at the same time.

852
00:59:20,643 --> 00:59:22,345
Yeah.

853
00:59:22,425 --> 00:59:24,146
And some of our monitoring interfaces

854
00:59:24,206 --> 00:59:26,308
are built so that we can see what usage is

855
00:59:26,348 --> 00:59:27,148
at specific times.

856
00:59:27,529 --> 00:59:29,750
And that will help us adjust as time goes on.

857
00:59:30,851 --> 00:59:31,011
Cool.

858
00:59:31,311 --> 00:59:31,492
Thanks.

859
00:59:33,739 --> 00:59:37,081
I'm sorry, we have very little time left, so this is going to be the last question.

860
00:59:37,181 --> 00:59:42,805
We can meet up in the wrap-up room, in room 204, after the talk.

861
00:59:43,795 --> 00:59:51,397
I just had a question about the sort of direct improvisational acting versus the sound box

862
00:59:51,817 --> 00:59:58,539
stuff is at one point you had an actor directly speaking and other times you're choosing what

863
00:59:58,579 --> 00:59:58,999
to say.

864
00:59:59,419 --> 01:00:00,839
Is there a balance between those?

865
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:06,941
How do you balance that and what there must be a lot that's lost in the sound box versus

866
01:00:07,201 --> 01:00:10,102
direct dialogue if that is happening at all?

867
01:00:10,302 --> 01:00:14,248
Yeah, so direct dialogue is 80% and it's mostly other characters.

868
01:00:14,328 --> 01:00:22,540
The soundboards are very specific NPCs that, because there's about four hour content of just single player game and multiplayer experience that you don't see, that's not involved.

869
01:00:23,281 --> 01:00:24,683
Well, that the actors come in and out of.

870
01:00:26,204 --> 01:00:31,610
So there's particular NPCs that you meet and you get to know over time, and because their identity is established,

871
01:00:32,090 --> 01:00:37,275
that's one of the reasons that we kind of have this like a soundboard, but it's not,

872
01:00:38,136 --> 01:00:43,221
it's really the delicate and the graceful way of writing that soundboard that doesn't make you feel canned, which is important.

873
01:00:43,938 --> 01:00:48,823
So it's a separate category of actor that will be sort of hired to operate the soundboard?

874
01:00:48,923 --> 01:00:51,805
Or it's just a different role that you're playing?

875
01:00:52,146 --> 01:00:53,827
It's a different role.

876
01:00:53,967 --> 01:00:56,029
We've trained people on different methods.

877
01:00:57,070 --> 01:01:04,357
And your intention is that as you scale up, you'll hire more and more actors to fill those direct dialogue speaking roles?

878
01:01:10,555 --> 01:01:16,237
Right now we plan to have a couple of hubs where we'll have actors there working, doing shifts.

879
01:01:17,677 --> 01:01:23,900
Because we're using the Quest, we can just give headsets to some actors, like for example Paiho, and have them log in from their homes.

880
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:30,482
Julian is working on a system where we can start identifying the times where there's more people.

881
01:01:30,902 --> 01:01:35,524
We can send alerts, being like, oh my god, there's a lot of players right now, we need people in,

882
01:01:35,764 --> 01:01:38,265
and the actors who have been giving headsets can just log in.

883
01:01:38,707 --> 01:01:42,610
And it's important to mention that we actually have an elaborate behind the scenes system

884
01:01:42,650 --> 01:01:47,373
of prioritizing people who have not yet seen a live actor in different ways, so that they're

885
01:01:47,473 --> 01:01:48,074
sorted in specific ways.

886
01:01:48,094 --> 01:01:48,334
Thanks, guys.

887
01:01:48,354 --> 01:01:48,614
Thank you.

888
01:01:48,694 --> 01:01:50,295
I think that's all our time.

889
01:01:50,315 --> 01:01:50,656
Thank you so much.

890
01:01:50,676 --> 01:01:51,116
Thank you.

891
01:01:51,156 --> 01:01:51,336
Thank you.

892
01:01:51,376 --> 01:01:51,636
Thank you.

893
01:01:51,656 --> 01:01:52,717
Thank you.

894
01:01:52,757 --> 01:01:52,957
Thank you.

895
01:01:52,977 --> 01:01:53,198
Thank you.

896
01:01:53,218 --> 01:01:53,518
Thank you.

897
01:01:53,538 --> 01:01:53,718
Thank you.

898
01:01:53,738 --> 01:01:53,918
Thank you.

899
01:01:53,938 --> 01:01:54,118
Thank you.

900
01:01:54,138 --> 01:01:54,338
Thank you.

901
01:01:54,398 --> 01:01:54,599
Thank you.

902
01:01:54,619 --> 01:01:54,819
Thank you.

903
01:01:54,839 --> 01:01:55,039
Thank you.

904
01:01:55,059 --> 01:01:55,259
Thank you.
