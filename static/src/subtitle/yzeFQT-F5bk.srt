00:00:03,902 --> 00:00:07,863
So, hello, my name is Xavier Guilbault, I'm Gameplay Tech Lead at Ubisoft Montreal.

2
00:00:08,364 --> 00:00:10,364
And I'm Frédéric Dol, AI Programmer on For Honor.

3
00:00:10,924 --> 00:00:15,006
So, we want to talk to you about the upcoming presentation that we're going to be doing at GDC,

4
00:00:15,086 --> 00:00:20,407
which is called Replicated vs. Deterministic AI, Building the Battlefield of For Honor.

5
00:00:20,867 --> 00:00:25,869
So, what we want to do is really showcase to you guys the failures, the pitfalls,

6
00:00:26,169 --> 00:00:28,450
and hopefully the successes that we had in building the game.

7
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:32,831
It's a talk aimed mostly at AI programmers and AI designers.

8
00:00:33,231 --> 00:00:36,333
So on one side, I'm going to be talking about the deterministic AI.

9
00:00:36,513 --> 00:00:41,875
What we mean about that, how we ended up building a fully deterministic system for all our AI

10
00:00:42,295 --> 00:00:45,896
to have a distributed AI working over the network,

11
00:00:46,236 --> 00:00:49,438
but without any information sent over the network for their synchronization.

12
00:00:49,978 --> 00:00:55,921
What tools we ended up building for navigation, to combat, to give the designers the proper levers for that.

13
00:00:57,642 --> 00:01:02,005
So that's basically how we built the armies and how the clashes happened.

14
00:01:03,065 --> 00:01:06,347
On my side, I will talk about the replicated AI systems that we built for the game.

15
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:08,768
So in the game, we have different characters.

16
00:01:08,988 --> 00:01:11,910
All the playable characters have a lot of specificities,

17
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:17,353
and we managed to extract all these specificities to expose them for the AI.

18
00:01:17,813 --> 00:01:18,914
So this will be the first part.

19
00:01:19,274 --> 00:01:23,137
Secondly, we will talk about how we managed to create a tool to empower the designers

20
00:01:23,177 --> 00:01:28,100
to be able to use all these specificities and control the characters, try everything they wanted.

21
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:34,645
and finally ship the game with all the AI that we needed for the PvP and for the campaign.

22
00:01:35,385 --> 00:01:40,029
And also we will expose all the validation systems that we built for the AI

23
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:44,152
to be able to validate that the difficulty of the AI that we built

24
00:01:44,693 --> 00:01:48,536
are what the designer wants to do, to create,

25
00:01:48,756 --> 00:01:53,320
and if they are coherent for all these difficulty levels.

26
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,202
So that's it. See you soon in San Francisco.

27
00:01:56,342 --> 00:01:56,903
Hope to see you there.
