1
00:00:08,952 --> 00:00:09,372
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:09,372 --> 00:00:12,293
Thank you so much for attending my talk,

3
00:00:12,293 --> 00:00:14,453
Designing Communities for Kindness.

4
00:00:14,453 --> 00:00:18,674
This is a talk I've been wanting to do for ages.

5
00:00:18,674 --> 00:00:21,075
And I'm really excited to finally be presenting it.

6
00:00:21,075 --> 00:00:23,855
I wish I was in person, but obviously, I'm still

7
00:00:23,855 --> 00:00:26,536
happy that we are here online.

8
00:00:26,536 --> 00:00:28,936
So yeah, let's just get into it.

9
00:00:28,936 --> 00:00:31,497
I'm really excited, really nervous.

10
00:00:31,497 --> 00:00:31,957
So let's go.

11
00:00:31,957 --> 00:00:32,077
OK.

12
00:00:33,147 --> 00:00:39,251
So, the world can feel like a very lonely place.

13
00:00:39,251 --> 00:00:41,973
I've been lucky enough to always have people I could talk to every day,

14
00:00:41,973 --> 00:00:46,477
people who cared about me, and lived in places where I could meet more people.

15
00:00:46,477 --> 00:00:50,319
I definitely wasn't short on any opportunities to connect with people,

16
00:00:50,319 --> 00:00:53,542
but I definitely felt short on connection a number of times.

17
00:00:54,162 --> 00:00:59,166
It's hard to escape this feeling of feeling very separate or isolated or depressed, honestly,

18
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:03,709
but all the times I've been able to get through them have been by finding communities and making

19
00:01:03,709 --> 00:01:06,270
the active but difficult effort to reach out.

20
00:01:06,998 --> 00:01:10,559
And sometimes it's been the active effort of others that have saved me.

21
00:01:10,559 --> 00:01:13,801
So I really wanted to talk about kindness online.

22
00:01:13,801 --> 00:01:17,022
Some communities are physical, obviously, and some are online.

23
00:01:17,022 --> 00:01:20,984
And if we consider how we use and structure these online spaces to be healthy

24
00:01:20,984 --> 00:01:24,765
and consider how we make deep connections, that could be a really powerful thing.

25
00:01:25,445 --> 00:01:30,507
maybe kindness isn't talked about anymore because we've become so used to it and it's become so

26
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:36,350
ubiquitous in online spaces we take it for granted or we become jaded by the very platforms we found

27
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:41,492
solace in and I mean for a really good reason too but it's really easy to be jaded and do

28
00:01:41,492 --> 00:01:44,213
nothing about it and it's harder to be jaded and do something.

29
00:01:45,534 --> 00:01:48,235
So this talk focuses not on multiplayer in-game chats,

30
00:01:48,235 --> 00:01:50,995
but on the places that players gather outside of the games,

31
00:01:50,995 --> 00:01:54,456
on places like Discord, forums, or Twitter.

32
00:01:54,456 --> 00:01:55,816
And here's the thing, for a lot of us,

33
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:57,997
online spaces have become our communities,

34
00:01:57,997 --> 00:01:59,957
the places where we socialize,

35
00:01:59,957 --> 00:02:02,458
learn the norms of the place and find our belongingness.

36
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:04,358
Essentially, this can be thought of

37
00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:06,519
as something similar to the role of like a church

38
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:08,939
or something large families once played.

39
00:02:08,939 --> 00:02:10,060
So even if we don't want to,

40
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,800
we need to start asking ourselves,

41
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,340
what kind of communities are we building?

42
00:02:14,694 --> 00:02:18,457
And the reason I find this so important is because, hi, I'm Victoria.

43
00:02:18,457 --> 00:02:21,320
I'm the communications director at Kitbox Games,

44
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,943
which is a small indie studio in Montreal, Canada.

45
00:02:24,943 --> 00:02:26,805
We develop and publish a bunch of games,

46
00:02:26,805 --> 00:02:30,048
maybe some of which you've heard of, also, on Twitter, at the Vtrend.

47
00:02:30,048 --> 00:02:34,052
Feel free to follow and tweet at me as this presentation goes on.

48
00:02:34,832 --> 00:02:40,534
But basically, no matter what game we make or publish or develop, what's important to me is

49
00:02:40,534 --> 00:02:45,476
that no matter what game it is, that it's a welcoming and kind space for any player joining.

50
00:02:45,476 --> 00:02:50,717
There are layers to help people act, of course, but I'm speaking from a more macro sociological basis.

51
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:54,067
So before we get into design, we need to talk basics,

52
00:02:54,067 --> 00:02:56,389
which is how you can set any sort of tone

53
00:02:56,389 --> 00:02:57,550
for your community at all.

54
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,413
Devs tend to know they want a community,

55
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:02,695
but neglect considering what kind of belongingness

56
00:03:02,695 --> 00:03:04,096
they want from them.

57
00:03:04,096 --> 00:03:05,818
And then those who consider it might decide

58
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:09,441
they want fluffy concepts like positive, or healthy,

59
00:03:09,441 --> 00:03:12,604
or engaged, or nice, or any number of words

60
00:03:12,604 --> 00:03:14,325
that you've probably heard before.

61
00:03:15,127 --> 00:03:17,488
And that's a really great goal, but it doesn't concretely

62
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:19,429
describe what actions to take.

63
00:03:19,429 --> 00:03:20,469
So how do you get there?

64
00:03:20,469 --> 00:03:22,170
That's where community developers come in.

65
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:25,832
Community developers grow and build up and direct

66
00:03:25,832 --> 00:03:29,194
the fan base in the direction we want it to move towards.

67
00:03:29,194 --> 00:03:33,036
You may think that, say, a violent FPS game will only

68
00:03:33,036 --> 00:03:35,077
attract violent, aggressive people,

69
00:03:35,077 --> 00:03:36,417
but that's wrong, for sure.

70
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:38,718
Some of the nicest people can be found here.

71
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,479
And the ultimate final tone is dependent

72
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:42,380
on the structure of the space that you set out.

73
00:03:43,358 --> 00:03:45,820
So if you want to start thinking like a community developer

74
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,000
and how you can start to set tone,

75
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,802
here are five mental qualities as a community dev

76
00:03:49,802 --> 00:03:51,122
to keep in mind.

77
00:03:51,122 --> 00:03:53,123
And don't worry, we get into the nitty gritty

78
00:03:53,123 --> 00:03:55,985
of the actual structural part in just a bit.

79
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,045
So first is ambition.

80
00:03:57,045 --> 00:03:58,906
Do you plan for and demand the best

81
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,967
of your platform and community?

82
00:04:00,967 --> 00:04:01,668
You need to have a goal,

83
00:04:01,668 --> 00:04:04,869
you need to have an actual community idea in mind.

84
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:10,785
Second is decisiveness. It will involve some work from you, from moderators, and a willingness to

85
00:04:10,785 --> 00:04:16,450
ban, which is a really uncomfortable situation, and I won't lie about that. Third is clarity.

86
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:21,435
So I'm going to mention this a lot during the talk, but we cannot devalue the importance of

87
00:04:21,435 --> 00:04:26,260
soft skills. Soft skills are important, and the ability to articulate yourself in this.

88
00:04:27,638 --> 00:04:29,780
And of course, collaboration, you're not a lone wolf.

89
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:32,162
Are you working with your team and your community

90
00:04:32,162 --> 00:04:34,064
to actually build these spaces?

91
00:04:34,064 --> 00:04:35,645
And finally, energy.

92
00:04:35,645 --> 00:04:38,968
So do you bring the positivity to the community

93
00:04:38,968 --> 00:04:40,149
and lead by example?

94
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:43,272
And once you've set your goals and purpose as a community dev,

95
00:04:43,272 --> 00:04:46,534
you'll be able to better set the tone for the community

96
00:04:46,534 --> 00:04:47,936
that you want.

97
00:04:47,936 --> 00:04:49,377
And for our purposes, we'll be talking

98
00:04:49,377 --> 00:04:51,298
about how to design communities for kindness.

99
00:04:52,475 --> 00:04:54,058
But of course, if we talk about kindness,

100
00:04:54,058 --> 00:04:55,760
we do need to define it.

101
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,723
And one of the most important things

102
00:04:57,723 --> 00:05:00,307
that I consider when I talk about kindness

103
00:05:00,307 --> 00:05:01,750
is that it is a verb.

104
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,551
It is not a noun.

105
00:05:02,551 --> 00:05:04,574
It requires practice.

106
00:05:04,574 --> 00:05:07,078
It requires continual effort and continual acts.

107
00:05:07,679 --> 00:05:12,383
So kind community design doesn't mean chanting positive affirmations into your community every

108
00:05:12,383 --> 00:05:17,948
day. Though you can do it if you want to, I'm not going to stop you and whatever, flit your boat.

109
00:05:17,948 --> 00:05:22,652
But what it really means is creating a safe, low pressure, helpful, and encouraging

110
00:05:22,652 --> 00:05:26,015
interactive space among the players who in turn want to help each other.

111
00:05:27,207 --> 00:05:29,788
Superficial notions of kindness won't suffice here.

112
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:32,188
When we are kind, it doesn't mean we're giving people

113
00:05:32,188 --> 00:05:34,049
a pass for bad behavior.

114
00:05:34,049 --> 00:05:36,369
Responding with, we just need to be kind to one another

115
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:37,690
when someone does something,

116
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,110
like calling another person a slur,

117
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,651
brushes over real complexities of life.

118
00:05:41,651 --> 00:05:43,951
So kindness means we need to hold people accountable,

119
00:05:43,951 --> 00:05:45,611
think of the realities of the world,

120
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:48,492
and set our spaces to be both warm and progressive.

121
00:05:49,952 --> 00:05:53,393
And with that, we get into a few caveats to kindness design.

122
00:05:53,393 --> 00:05:55,654
So just really quickly, one, these things

123
00:05:55,654 --> 00:05:58,956
will not automatically make your space kinder or safer.

124
00:05:58,956 --> 00:06:00,797
This takes time and continued effort.

125
00:06:00,797 --> 00:06:03,878
Two, this isn't some mass strategy dreamed up

126
00:06:03,878 --> 00:06:06,760
to get user attention and hit KPIs.

127
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,841
Kindness is based on being genuine.

128
00:06:08,841 --> 00:06:10,922
And while this will help you in the long term,

129
00:06:10,922 --> 00:06:12,642
in the short term, it is a frightening

130
00:06:12,642 --> 00:06:16,164
and maybe uncomfortable situation to be in sometimes.

131
00:06:16,484 --> 00:06:18,725
And as with anything, there are a lot of variables

132
00:06:18,725 --> 00:06:21,687
that you'll have to think of, depending on team size, game

133
00:06:21,687 --> 00:06:23,188
size, and community size.

134
00:06:23,188 --> 00:06:25,730
Our community strategies may only

135
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,471
have been as successful as they are,

136
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:28,911
because we're relatively small.

137
00:06:28,911 --> 00:06:32,534
Giant mega communities with million unit selling games

138
00:06:32,534 --> 00:06:35,776
probably need additional strategies.

139
00:06:35,776 --> 00:06:38,617
Essentially, I want people to be mindful of how they love

140
00:06:38,617 --> 00:06:41,579
and interact with our games, and not just what they love.

141
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:43,320
So let's talk about design communities

142
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,701
for what I consider to be kindness.

143
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:49,662
So these are the basic steps towards kindness design, which I'll extrapolate on further.

144
00:06:49,662 --> 00:06:55,248
The first base step is to create rules, which are social systems that shape and influence behavior.

145
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:59,732
Rules that aren't as helpful as you think they are are things like,

146
00:06:59,732 --> 00:07:03,095
don't be a dick, or just be nice, be respectful, etc.

147
00:07:03,095 --> 00:07:07,019
These aren't really that productive or actually informative,

148
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:10,683
and often result in people disputing the rule's meaning when they break it.

149
00:07:11,093 --> 00:07:17,674
Also, honestly, don't be a dick is like the bare minimum people should be online.

150
00:07:17,674 --> 00:07:21,815
So to build better rules, we need to understand what a social system is.

151
00:07:21,815 --> 00:07:26,556
Social systems are the relationships between the individuals, groups, and institutions.

152
00:07:26,556 --> 00:07:31,637
So they can predict and shape how your behavior is influenced by the certain group that someone is

153
00:07:31,637 --> 00:07:37,138
part of. For example, the way you behave and interact at work might be very different from

154
00:07:37,138 --> 00:07:38,218
how you interact at home.

155
00:07:39,062 --> 00:07:43,205
The same goes for whether you're in a hospital, a library, a school, a museum, etc.

156
00:07:43,205 --> 00:07:48,088
These systems have their own set of rules that allows the group and institution as a whole to

157
00:07:48,088 --> 00:07:53,531
function smoothly. Breaking the rules causes chaos or resistance, and game communities are exactly the same.

158
00:07:54,624 --> 00:07:56,826
In the book The Forest and the Trees by Alan G. Johnson,

159
00:07:56,826 --> 00:07:59,968
he uses the board game Monopoly as an example.

160
00:07:59,968 --> 00:08:02,249
So Monopoly is a mini social system with rules.

161
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:04,911
Following these rules offer the path of least resistance

162
00:08:04,911 --> 00:08:06,773
to playing the game, but following them

163
00:08:06,773 --> 00:08:08,574
also impacts player behavior.

164
00:08:08,574 --> 00:08:10,575
If you've played Monopoly before,

165
00:08:10,575 --> 00:08:12,336
you know the whole goal is to control the board,

166
00:08:12,336 --> 00:08:14,558
and winning involves making sure your opponents lose

167
00:08:14,558 --> 00:08:16,359
all their money and property.

168
00:08:16,359 --> 00:08:19,041
That is, players are let down one path.

169
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:19,241
Greed.

170
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,782
It's a rule set that not only encourages greed and all the attributes that come with that,

171
00:08:24,782 --> 00:08:29,944
but makes it a necessary part of the experience. The point isn't about if the game is fun or not,

172
00:08:29,944 --> 00:08:34,707
but that the rules encourage this behavior for participation regardless of your own personal

173
00:08:34,707 --> 00:08:39,789
values. And if you refuse to abide by them, like by cheating, the other players will probably get

174
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:43,691
angry at you or they'll kick you out and you won't be a part of the game anymore.

175
00:08:44,904 --> 00:08:52,011
So when we talk about social systems here, it's important to consider what you as a person privileged to be setting the rules do with this.

176
00:08:52,011 --> 00:09:01,942
So as Johnson notes, notice that we can describe the game without saying anything about the personalities, intentions, attitudes, or other characteristics of the people who might be playing it.

177
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:06,206
The game, in other words, has an existence that we can describe all by itself.

178
00:09:06,206 --> 00:09:08,548
It exists whether or not anyone is playing it.

179
00:09:08,668 --> 00:09:10,389
The same is true of social systems.

180
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:14,432
So what outcomes are you looking for with your rule set?

181
00:09:14,432 --> 00:09:17,294
What is the path of least resistance?

182
00:09:17,294 --> 00:09:18,614
In monopoly, it's greed.

183
00:09:18,614 --> 00:09:20,896
And for Kit Fox, it's kindness.

184
00:09:20,896 --> 00:09:23,237
So now that we understand what a social system is,

185
00:09:23,237 --> 00:09:24,938
we can kind of get into the nitty gritty

186
00:09:24,938 --> 00:09:26,239
of how you create rules.

187
00:09:27,042 --> 00:09:29,265
So people will have different ideas of the rules

188
00:09:29,265 --> 00:09:31,008
and how they should be implemented.

189
00:09:31,008 --> 00:09:33,851
But at the very least, according to the World Justice Project

190
00:09:33,851 --> 00:09:37,536
and my own studies in sociology, these

191
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:41,101
are the universal principles for the rule of law.

192
00:09:41,101 --> 00:09:43,184
So first is that they are clearly defined.

193
00:09:43,184 --> 00:09:44,546
So don't mince your words.

194
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:48,134
don't try to make it some complicated thing,

195
00:09:48,134 --> 00:09:49,815
make it very easy to understand.

196
00:09:49,815 --> 00:09:52,396
Two, they're publicized, so they're very easy to find

197
00:09:52,396 --> 00:09:54,056
and see, not hidden anywhere.

198
00:09:54,056 --> 00:09:57,437
Three, they're stable, so they don't change very frequently.

199
00:09:57,437 --> 00:09:59,278
You don't take anyone by surprise

200
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:01,319
by a sudden change in rules.

201
00:10:01,319 --> 00:10:04,640
Four, they're just, so they seem reasonably fair for what they

202
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,100
are and what the space is.

203
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,561
And five, which is very important, which I have

204
00:10:09,715 --> 00:10:15,680
not seen too many people adhere to sometimes, is that they are applied evenly and quickly to

205
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,705
everyone. Everyone in the space, no matter how much of a participant they are in it, etc. So,

206
00:10:20,705 --> 00:10:26,490
keep those in mind when you create rules. So, for example, these are the Kitfox Discord rules.

207
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,692
Don't worry about reading them all, they're all in our Discord.

208
00:10:29,373 --> 00:10:32,555
but I just wanted to point out that as part of the rules,

209
00:10:32,555 --> 00:10:34,837
I actually have a general framing element

210
00:10:34,837 --> 00:10:36,739
for the tone I expect from those joining.

211
00:10:36,739 --> 00:10:39,141
And this is kind of part of setting the tone

212
00:10:39,141 --> 00:10:40,963
for the entire space.

213
00:10:40,963 --> 00:10:42,344
So often what I'll do when I know

214
00:10:42,344 --> 00:10:43,865
we have a big announcement coming up,

215
00:10:43,865 --> 00:10:46,648
meaning our Discord will be flooded with new people,

216
00:10:46,648 --> 00:10:48,249
is warn the community that the sensor bot

217
00:10:48,249 --> 00:10:49,951
will be hypersensitive to more words.

218
00:10:49,951 --> 00:10:52,072
This helps drive the tone of what I expect

219
00:10:52,072 --> 00:10:53,073
from new people entering,

220
00:10:53,073 --> 00:10:54,494
and once the initial boom is over,

221
00:10:54,494 --> 00:10:56,056
I go back to relaxing the rules.

222
00:10:57,313 --> 00:10:59,074
And when rules are broken, often what helps

223
00:10:59,074 --> 00:11:01,895
is a message their way with an explanation or a warning

224
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:03,196
before any action is taken,

225
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:06,397
rather than an outright call out for everyone to see.

226
00:11:06,397 --> 00:11:08,939
Shame and embarrassment in public is usually more effective

227
00:11:08,939 --> 00:11:10,820
for making the person feel defensive

228
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,000
rather than receptive to change.

229
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,321
Give people a chance to improve and learn.

230
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:16,811
And if someone's coming out of anger, talk to them.

231
00:11:16,811 --> 00:11:19,311
See if you can help them vent in a healthy, productive way

232
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:21,832
and lead them to understand the tone of the community.

233
00:11:21,832 --> 00:11:23,772
If they still don't understand, maybe the community

234
00:11:23,772 --> 00:11:25,013
isn't for them.

235
00:11:25,013 --> 00:11:26,933
Membership is a conditional privilege

236
00:11:26,933 --> 00:11:29,794
that you can remove at any time, and you get to set the tone.

237
00:11:29,794 --> 00:11:33,935
And if it's a troll or someone just there to cause chaos,

238
00:11:33,935 --> 00:11:35,495
it's OK to ban them.

239
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:37,095
There's a time and place for everything,

240
00:11:37,095 --> 00:11:40,996
and you can't work with anyone coming in with that intention.

241
00:11:40,996 --> 00:11:42,277
So be decisive.

242
00:11:43,446 --> 00:11:47,267
And of course, there does actually need to be someone enforcing the rules for this to work.

243
00:11:47,267 --> 00:11:49,888
You can't just have it sit there and do nothing.

244
00:11:49,888 --> 00:11:51,188
Don't fear rule enforcement.

245
00:11:51,188 --> 00:11:55,269
It helps drive productive conversation and weeds out those that are under,

246
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:56,949
they're under false pretenses.

247
00:11:56,949 --> 00:12:00,070
Basically, just nip toxic members in the bud.

248
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:03,111
Don't keep toxic members around because they talk and contribute to a space

249
00:12:03,111 --> 00:12:04,391
and you're afraid of silence.

250
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:09,493
They actually take up more space and drive away more genuinely interested members.

251
00:12:09,493 --> 00:12:12,493
And every forum needs rules to maintain its purpose and functionality.

252
00:12:14,884 --> 00:12:17,249
There are going to be times when you can't monitor social.

253
00:12:17,249 --> 00:12:19,874
You're at a convention, vacation, busy, et cetera.

254
00:12:19,874 --> 00:12:21,698
A good community shouldn't collapse

255
00:12:21,698 --> 00:12:22,900
because you're not around.

256
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,023
The better your rules,

257
00:12:24,023 --> 00:12:25,746
the better your community can sustain itself.

258
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,811
So the next step in community design

259
00:12:28,811 --> 00:12:31,313
is creating a baseline of respect of you

260
00:12:31,313 --> 00:12:32,614
as a person in the community.

261
00:12:32,614 --> 00:12:35,475
They need to understand that you are obviously

262
00:12:35,475 --> 00:12:38,897
a living, breathing person with emotions and boundaries.

263
00:12:38,897 --> 00:12:40,939
If your community can't respect your boundaries,

264
00:12:40,939 --> 00:12:43,140
they probably won't respect each other's.

265
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,481
So this is the first step that moves people

266
00:12:45,481 --> 00:12:48,323
from only seeing nameless, faceless rules

267
00:12:48,323 --> 00:12:50,665
into seeing you as a person.

268
00:12:50,665 --> 00:12:51,605
And that's very important.

269
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:54,767
So let's talk about examples on steps on how to create this.

270
00:12:56,298 --> 00:12:58,980
First, it's my favorite, is to be offline.

271
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:02,321
Be offline when you need to be.

272
00:13:02,321 --> 00:13:04,102
9 to 5 p.m., whatever your work hours are.

273
00:13:04,102 --> 00:13:06,322
When I pop in secretly to places like our Discord

274
00:13:06,322 --> 00:13:09,164
to check nothing is on fire, even if someone needs me,

275
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:10,964
I try not to respond until the morning.

276
00:13:10,964 --> 00:13:12,525
This way, they respect my time,

277
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,526
the Discord gets used to it, et cetera.

278
00:13:14,526 --> 00:13:19,208
I encourage others to be accountable to each other and me.

279
00:13:20,088 --> 00:13:25,053
Being critical of your actions is okay. You're allowed to make mistakes, people are allowed to disagree, you're human.

280
00:13:25,053 --> 00:13:31,320
But there are certain ways to garner criticism that are more respectful than others, and telling them you are receptive to it,

281
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:35,124
but if only if it's framed constructively, is a really good starting point.

282
00:13:35,124 --> 00:13:41,451
Those that hurl abuses are going to be blocked, probably, or ignored, rather than listened to, and people will quickly understand that.

283
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:45,965
Plus, how you act among those that disagree or argue with you matters.

284
00:13:45,965 --> 00:13:48,947
Just because someone might say or do something stupid

285
00:13:48,947 --> 00:13:53,291
doesn't mean that it's okay to mock members of the community or those that leave it.

286
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,532
Your community is keeping an eye on what you say.

287
00:13:55,532 --> 00:13:57,914
If you're going to start talking behind someone's back,

288
00:13:57,914 --> 00:14:00,856
if they leave your community, even if you think it'd be really funny,

289
00:14:00,856 --> 00:14:02,778
it doesn't actually reflect very well on you.

290
00:14:02,778 --> 00:14:06,901
For respect, you need to separate people from their behaviors.

291
00:14:06,901 --> 00:14:09,463
Address what they're doing and not who they actually are.

292
00:14:09,463 --> 00:14:12,365
And if you do get through to them, you can give people a golden bridge.

293
00:14:13,347 --> 00:14:15,969
This basically means not holding something against someone.

294
00:14:15,969 --> 00:14:21,914
Allow people who might have voiced something undesirable to be able to exit or change their mind gracefully with no shame.

295
00:14:21,914 --> 00:14:27,859
So for example, maybe you've managed to calm someone down after they come into your Discord angry that a game is delayed.

296
00:14:27,859 --> 00:14:33,624
A golden bridge allows them to stay in your community should they so choose, or to leave without a sense of bitterness against the studio.

297
00:14:34,284 --> 00:14:38,547
Instead of saying something like, I told you so, or making a really stonking comment towards them

298
00:14:38,547 --> 00:14:43,210
to humiliate them further, you can say something like, we all make mistakes, or something as simple

299
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:48,553
as no worries, or it's all good, works too. Basically, just don't be petty. Be someone that

300
00:14:48,553 --> 00:14:49,374
they can look up to.

301
00:14:50,711 --> 00:14:53,553
But respect isn't just about addressing negative emotions.

302
00:14:53,553 --> 00:14:56,934
Some of the most difficult things in community development

303
00:14:56,934 --> 00:14:58,115
are not the angry trolls.

304
00:14:58,115 --> 00:15:00,336
It's the members who you know have your best interests

305
00:15:00,336 --> 00:15:02,678
at heart, but cross some sort of personal boundary

306
00:15:02,678 --> 00:15:05,059
or seek a therapy-like relationship with you.

307
00:15:06,331 --> 00:15:08,192
that you're really not equipped to handle.

308
00:15:08,192 --> 00:15:10,352
These are hard to call out.

309
00:15:10,352 --> 00:15:12,333
And my tips for you here are really difficult

310
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:15,694
because you can't give vague, generalized advice for this.

311
00:15:15,694 --> 00:15:18,175
I will say that above all, it's important to let them know

312
00:15:18,175 --> 00:15:19,815
that you do care about their wellbeing.

313
00:15:19,815 --> 00:15:20,856
And because of that,

314
00:15:20,856 --> 00:15:24,337
professional help is a better resource than you are.

315
00:15:24,337 --> 00:15:27,958
And honestly, it probably definitely is better than you,

316
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,898
unless you're a trained therapist,

317
00:15:29,898 --> 00:15:31,819
in which case, great job.

318
00:15:33,577 --> 00:15:44,662
So soon they will see that you're doing your best when you have time with them and not that you're neglecting or ignoring their needs, just like how community may expect you to act a certain way, you must also set expectations for them.

319
00:15:44,662 --> 00:15:53,147
So once respect is established, we move on to norms, which is a further dive into the acceptable ways of communication within the community as a whole.

320
00:15:53,982 --> 00:15:55,362
So there are two kinds of norms.

321
00:15:55,362 --> 00:15:58,304
Moors, which are norms that carry great importance,

322
00:15:58,304 --> 00:16:01,946
like laws, chat rules, et cetera, don't murder, whatever.

323
00:16:01,946 --> 00:16:06,289
And folkways, which are norms about casual daily interaction.

324
00:16:06,289 --> 00:16:08,230
Moors we understand really well.

325
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,831
Rules should not be broken.

326
00:16:09,831 --> 00:16:12,573
Folkways distinguish what we think is rude or polite,

327
00:16:12,573 --> 00:16:15,434
and often in community development that's overlooked,

328
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:17,496
but can plant the seed of unkindness when broken.

329
00:16:18,016 --> 00:16:25,548
That's why, as a community dev, you have to mentally distinguish what you think is acceptable ways for your community to talk to you and each other.

330
00:16:25,548 --> 00:16:27,872
Rules are easily defined. Politeness is not.

331
00:16:28,802 --> 00:16:31,264
For example, a folkway we have in North America

332
00:16:31,264 --> 00:16:32,966
is that you shouldn't stare at people

333
00:16:32,966 --> 00:16:34,347
when you're in an elevator.

334
00:16:34,347 --> 00:16:37,090
It's not illegal to stare at them.

335
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:39,352
It's just pretty rude and kind of weird.

336
00:16:39,352 --> 00:16:43,115
And for online communities, a joke in one game community

337
00:16:43,115 --> 00:16:44,336
might not fly in another.

338
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,899
So while you can't necessarily make rules on politeness,

339
00:16:46,899 --> 00:16:47,940
you can influence it.

340
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:53,797
Also be aware how your tone may come across to a stranger or someone who has just joined your community.

341
00:16:53,797 --> 00:17:00,619
For example, even proper capitalization and punctuation can actually make you sound quite strict in a very casual chatting environment.

342
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:05,560
You'll become the de facto leader for setting the folkways, even if you don't feel like you are.

343
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:12,122
So keep in mind how you interact and the jokes you make, because this will automatically be seen as the acceptable ways to communicate with each other.

344
00:17:12,122 --> 00:17:16,443
The more your community understands the norms of discourse, the better they interact with each other.

345
00:17:17,398 --> 00:17:23,901
So a lot of people think it's things like an anonymity that creates trolls, or what I will very scientifically call jerks.

346
00:17:23,901 --> 00:17:28,064
But it's not just that. After all, anonymous acts of kindness also exist.

347
00:17:28,064 --> 00:17:34,928
I argue it's when you have a person plus anonymity plus an audience that tolerates that behavior that kind of creates this jerk.

348
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:40,753
So what norms does is when you have people come in with anonymity, known social norms,

349
00:17:40,753 --> 00:17:47,340
and a community that isn't receptive to their unkindness, then you'll get a normal person,

350
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:52,205
or regular person, or at least someone who understands that this community isn't for them,

351
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:55,348
or the way they are interacting with us isn't seen as acceptable.

352
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,493
All right, so then we move on to one of the hardest things

353
00:17:59,493 --> 00:18:01,596
to create, which is trust.

354
00:18:01,596 --> 00:18:04,319
I don't think I'm a perfect community developer.

355
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:05,240
Far from it.

356
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,202
But what matters is that your community trusts

357
00:18:07,202 --> 00:18:09,645
that you're doing your best with the resources that you have.

358
00:18:10,872 --> 00:18:13,413
So you have to understand that if you're in a public-facing position,

359
00:18:13,413 --> 00:18:15,935
the community is literally relying on you.

360
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:18,937
They have no other way of getting a sense of the studio, usually,

361
00:18:18,937 --> 00:18:20,218
unless it's through you.

362
00:18:20,218 --> 00:18:22,380
And it's a really difficult line to straddle,

363
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:26,122
being understanding of both the developer side and the community side,

364
00:18:26,122 --> 00:18:28,944
which is why you need to be able to have your players trust you and what you do.

365
00:18:28,944 --> 00:18:32,847
So in order to create trust, there are four core tenets you need

366
00:18:32,847 --> 00:18:37,450
to do your best to adhere to, and that's integrity, action, intimacy, and openness.

367
00:18:38,864 --> 00:18:46,232
Integrity can be any number of things, things like admitting mistakes, sometimes acting against your own interests or financial gain,

368
00:18:46,232 --> 00:18:51,978
for example, saying a game isn't right for someone or offering a refund, keeping promises, and

369
00:18:51,978 --> 00:18:57,484
especially being honest when you don't want to be. For example, people are being hyped about something that isn't actually coming to the game.

370
00:18:58,717 --> 00:18:59,538
Second is action.

371
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:01,280
And this is the process of doing something

372
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,722
that lasts through some time,

373
00:19:02,722 --> 00:19:05,124
and importantly, consists of more than one act.

374
00:19:05,124 --> 00:19:07,708
Like I've said before, kindness is a verb, not a noun.

375
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:09,830
It's something that has to continue happening.

376
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:10,751
Trust isn't just lip service.

377
00:19:10,751 --> 00:19:12,534
You need to do things for them,

378
00:19:12,534 --> 00:19:14,196
or at least try being reliable,

379
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:15,818
trusting them with information,

380
00:19:15,818 --> 00:19:17,780
interacting with them, et cetera.

381
00:19:18,868 --> 00:19:23,355
There's also openness, you're going to need to give a bit in order to receive,

382
00:19:23,355 --> 00:19:27,620
showing compassion and sharing your thoughts and not in this difficult way,

383
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:31,005
being a closed off person, even though you may have those days, which is fine,

384
00:19:31,005 --> 00:19:35,731
too. And when asking for feedback, be open and understanding instead of

385
00:19:35,731 --> 00:19:36,192
defensive.

386
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,401
And then there's intimacy.

387
00:19:38,401 --> 00:19:40,203
So the less of a stranger you are,

388
00:19:40,203 --> 00:19:41,384
the more you interact with people,

389
00:19:41,384 --> 00:19:42,866
the more exposed they are to you.

390
00:19:42,866 --> 00:19:45,769
Creating shared experiences and finding common ground,

391
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:48,651
which should be easier since they're there for your game,

392
00:19:48,651 --> 00:19:49,432
and builds a rapport.

393
00:19:49,432 --> 00:19:51,394
And the more rapport you build, the more trust.

394
00:19:52,054 --> 00:19:56,757
Of course, this is partly dependent on your own studio acting responsibly.

395
00:19:56,757 --> 00:20:01,079
Some things are out of your control, but these are things for you to keep in mind.

396
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:03,601
And also, this will take time. You cannot rush this.

397
00:20:03,601 --> 00:20:07,203
This is a continuous circle of events that need to happen constantly.

398
00:20:07,203 --> 00:20:08,383
The more consistent, the better.

399
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:12,221
So for example, I've asked for feedback from our community.

400
00:20:12,221 --> 00:20:15,003
And this isn't some surface level way to placate them.

401
00:20:15,003 --> 00:20:17,265
I don't ask for feedback unless I generally think

402
00:20:17,265 --> 00:20:18,906
I can do something with that.

403
00:20:18,906 --> 00:20:22,028
So they do appreciate and they do notice

404
00:20:22,028 --> 00:20:23,530
when they see you doing something,

405
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:24,891
they don't always voice it,

406
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:27,313
but there have been times where it has been voiced

407
00:20:27,313 --> 00:20:28,253
and that has been very nice.

408
00:20:29,642 --> 00:20:31,783
There are so many ways you can show you're sincere,

409
00:20:31,783 --> 00:20:34,165
but again, keep in mind this isn't some sort of mind trick.

410
00:20:34,165 --> 00:20:35,285
You have to be sincere,

411
00:20:35,285 --> 00:20:37,827
and the trust will build slowly over time.

412
00:20:37,827 --> 00:20:39,808
And you can also have fun with them.

413
00:20:39,808 --> 00:20:41,709
That is an important part of trust.

414
00:20:41,709 --> 00:20:43,210
Be more than just information givers,

415
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:46,072
warning issuers, or lofty out of reach people.

416
00:20:46,072 --> 00:20:49,334
Every positive interaction you have with your community

417
00:20:49,334 --> 00:20:49,854
builds this report.

418
00:20:49,854 --> 00:20:50,835
And I'm not going to lie,

419
00:20:50,835 --> 00:20:52,936
it's going to take a lot of time, again,

420
00:20:52,936 --> 00:20:54,096
but it is definitely worth it.

421
00:20:55,444 --> 00:20:59,630
Alright, so the last one, which is home and say it with me, soft

422
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:03,034
skills are valuable. They are so valuable, especially online,

423
00:21:03,034 --> 00:21:05,898
when you're missing most of the nonverbal cues that give

424
00:21:05,898 --> 00:21:07,960
context to how a person is feeling your soft skills are

425
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,605
imperative to creating a warm, relaxing space, home, if you

426
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:11,685
will.

427
00:21:12,784 --> 00:21:19,471
So one-way communication is a little bit more difficult to do this with, but in places where

428
00:21:19,471 --> 00:21:23,115
you can interact more with people like forums and discord, there is more flexibility and

429
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:27,700
opportunities to create this feeling. But there's greater difficulty in keeping it consistent since

430
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:31,864
it depends on the members interacting within it. Just like mass conventions or crowds,

431
00:21:31,864 --> 00:21:33,846
it can be a really overwhelming place.

432
00:21:34,978 --> 00:21:39,840
So I think a lot of people equate the ability to communicate as being equal to actual connections

433
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,760
with others, which is false.

434
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,322
Connection is when people feel heard, seen, and valued and can derive strength from their

435
00:21:45,322 --> 00:21:46,322
relationship.

436
00:21:46,322 --> 00:21:48,583
So we need to design for these moments.

437
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:53,525
So cozier, more selective rooms allow for further similarity and goal orientation between

438
00:21:53,525 --> 00:21:58,307
members, encourages repeated interactions, and manages the density of the community from

439
00:21:58,307 --> 00:22:00,928
feeling too overwhelming and creates that true connection.

440
00:22:02,343 --> 00:22:08,950
So Kitfox Discord, for example, has pronoun roles, cozy channels like Cute and Good and Food and Noms,

441
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:14,595
private little servers and little secrets that you can discover as ways of joy.

442
00:22:14,595 --> 00:22:18,559
And these channels don't have any immediate value related to Kitfox,

443
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:23,224
however they do bring a sense of humanity to the space, and a place of refuge when channels are more chatty.

444
00:22:24,358 --> 00:22:28,743
And you may find other ways to foster a kinder space in your places.

445
00:22:28,743 --> 00:22:31,686
This is by no means the only way to create home-like feelings.

446
00:22:31,686 --> 00:22:33,407
Maybe you'll have a fun theme to your Discord.

447
00:22:33,407 --> 00:22:36,510
Maybe you'll have a metagame that people can participate in.

448
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:39,093
Maybe you'll literally make it all about being wholesome.

449
00:22:39,627 --> 00:22:43,570
whatever you want. As you solidify your community pillars and uphold your

450
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,751
community to standards you set, the better their reputation becomes.

451
00:22:46,751 --> 00:22:49,893
We've had people join KidVox purely because people had heard it was a

452
00:22:49,893 --> 00:22:52,695
positive place to be in, and most newcomers see how people

453
00:22:52,695 --> 00:22:55,937
interact, see their reputation, and naturally go along with this. It's a

454
00:22:55,937 --> 00:22:58,258
very beneficial and pleasant circle of events.

455
00:22:59,597 --> 00:23:02,240
So designing calendar communities and moderation

456
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,642
is not just about risk management.

457
00:23:03,642 --> 00:23:06,105
It's lifetime value will reward you.

458
00:23:06,105 --> 00:23:07,426
People will want to interact

459
00:23:07,426 --> 00:23:09,649
and will stick around for your future games to come.

460
00:23:09,649 --> 00:23:11,371
And long-term, there's less work on your end.

461
00:23:12,259 --> 00:23:15,462
Of course, at its very core, regardless of the spaces we create,

462
00:23:15,462 --> 00:23:19,686
Kitfox and any other studio exist to sell products, games, t-shirts, limited box sets,

463
00:23:19,686 --> 00:23:23,810
whatever. But while we're at it, we might as well do our best to make

464
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:28,354
the places we touch a little bit more positive. The user experience in games is important,

465
00:23:28,354 --> 00:23:33,039
but combined with a warm, friendly user experience in the community, that's good design.

466
00:23:34,528 --> 00:23:36,609
Kindness to me is like a candle.

467
00:23:36,609 --> 00:23:41,071
So some kindness will create a small glow in people

468
00:23:41,071 --> 00:23:42,952
and it'll be really nice.

469
00:23:42,952 --> 00:23:45,853
Some kindness doesn't light anyone's candle at all.

470
00:23:45,853 --> 00:23:46,393
That's okay too.

471
00:23:46,393 --> 00:23:49,875
But maybe I'll set someone's candle on fire

472
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:51,755
and create a huge ray of light within them.

473
00:23:51,755 --> 00:23:55,237
There are different intensities

474
00:23:55,237 --> 00:23:56,758
and who knows where I'll spread.

475
00:23:56,758 --> 00:23:58,338
Maybe I'll light other candles

476
00:23:58,338 --> 00:24:00,099
and create warm glows of kindness

477
00:24:00,099 --> 00:24:01,640
in other people who really need it.

478
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:04,762
And I know this has an impact.

479
00:24:04,762 --> 00:24:06,343
I know this affects people.

480
00:24:06,343 --> 00:24:07,884
I know this because there have been times

481
00:24:07,884 --> 00:24:11,666
where I've been saved by a small gesture or a little message

482
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:12,826
from someone online.

483
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:16,268
This talk was based partially on my own experiences

484
00:24:16,268 --> 00:24:19,890
as a confused and anxious person many a time.

485
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:22,111
But it's also rooted in the now, where

486
00:24:22,111 --> 00:24:23,652
I'm very blessed to have a job that

487
00:24:23,652 --> 00:24:25,433
allows me to interact with a community

488
00:24:25,433 --> 00:24:27,234
that I love very, very much.

489
00:24:27,998 --> 00:24:30,582
They've shown me time and time again that kindness is capable,

490
00:24:30,582 --> 00:24:34,107
even when we are all a little unsure, worried, or down,

491
00:24:34,107 --> 00:24:34,528
especially in 2020.

492
00:24:34,528 --> 00:24:37,091
And that it's OK to turn to a stranger

493
00:24:37,091 --> 00:24:40,216
and talk about something silly and nonsensical

494
00:24:40,216 --> 00:24:41,357
and be accepted for that.

495
00:24:43,043 --> 00:24:47,765
Every time we choose kindness, we make the world around us just a little bit kinder and braver.

496
00:24:47,765 --> 00:24:50,166
We don't need to just survive as an industry.

497
00:24:50,166 --> 00:24:50,986
We want to thrive.

498
00:24:50,986 --> 00:24:56,408
It's not impossible to combine technology and creativity with compassion and ethics.

499
00:24:56,408 --> 00:25:04,210
For me, meaning flows from connection, from being a part of communities that are bigger than me, but nevertheless value and include me in them.

500
00:25:05,457 --> 00:25:07,737
So if we can create kinder spaces online,

501
00:25:07,737 --> 00:25:09,518
people can form real connections

502
00:25:09,518 --> 00:25:11,238
they couldn't have otherwise.

503
00:25:11,238 --> 00:25:12,498
And I hope that connection helps them

504
00:25:12,498 --> 00:25:13,799
face the real world too.

505
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:15,559
And if you thought this whole talk,

506
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:19,540
especially the end, was dumb and cheesy,

507
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:21,941
then I hope some kindness hits you so hard

508
00:25:21,941 --> 00:25:24,241
that your jaw breaks from smiling too much.

509
00:25:24,241 --> 00:25:26,462
Thanks for listening to my talk.

510
00:25:26,462 --> 00:25:33,964
Decided to add it in at the last minute,

511
00:25:33,964 --> 00:25:34,944
but the misconception is.

512
00:25:36,038 --> 00:25:38,740
This is all too fluffy.

513
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,461
Oh, it burns.

514
00:25:40,461 --> 00:25:43,303
Because we'll talk about concepts like cohesion

515
00:25:43,303 --> 00:25:45,445
and how important it is, and people will come back

516
00:25:45,445 --> 00:25:46,426
with things like, it's too fluffy.

517
00:25:46,426 --> 00:25:50,769
Decades of science begs to differ.

518
00:25:50,769 --> 00:25:53,210
We are not making this stuff up.

519
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:54,311
We're just trying to figure out

520
00:25:54,311 --> 00:25:55,812
how best we can apply it to games.

521
00:25:55,812 --> 00:26:00,035
But all right, let's bring it on home.

522
00:26:00,035 --> 00:26:01,976
For those of us that are working in fair play

523
00:26:01,976 --> 00:26:04,758
and in player dynamics, we want to increase investment.

524
00:26:05,317 --> 00:26:08,258
And there are five strategies that we've been using,

525
00:26:08,258 --> 00:26:10,118
that I've seen to be effective,

526
00:26:10,118 --> 00:26:11,679
that we saw effective in UX design,

527
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,760
and hopefully will save you a lot of time and effort.

528
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,281
Champion by doing, just get in a way,

529
00:26:17,281 --> 00:26:18,942
just get in there, find a way to do the work.

530
00:26:18,942 --> 00:26:22,483
Gauge the maturity level of your company,

531
00:26:22,483 --> 00:26:24,064
which means figure out the right strategy

532
00:26:24,064 --> 00:26:26,885
for where they're at to help them move up that ladder.

533
00:26:28,067 --> 00:26:31,568
Find a process, work it, hone it with others

534
00:26:31,568 --> 00:26:34,009
so that you can have a reliable way to organize

535
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:37,290
towards these goals and understand what you're doing.

536
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:40,051
Get that data so you know if you're affecting change.

537
00:26:40,051 --> 00:26:42,292
We've proposed a framework for both this

538
00:26:42,292 --> 00:26:44,773
and the process that we hope will help

539
00:26:44,773 --> 00:26:45,994
and prepare for the misconceptions

540
00:26:45,994 --> 00:26:48,915
because they're gonna happen.

541
00:26:48,915 --> 00:26:52,316
That comes with the territory, did with UX design

542
00:26:52,316 --> 00:26:53,716
and it will again for player dynamics

543
00:26:53,716 --> 00:26:54,757
and our work in fair play.

544
00:26:54,757 --> 00:26:55,317
Thank you very much.
