1
00:00:06,258 --> 00:00:09,760
My name is Aviv Stern, and I'm the director of analytics

2
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:10,940
at Social Points.

3
00:00:12,301 --> 00:00:14,982
And I've been a gamer since the 80s.

4
00:00:15,842 --> 00:00:18,143
I started with D&D, the gateway game,

5
00:00:18,323 --> 00:00:21,644
and then I matured into XCOM, unlike today,

6
00:00:21,684 --> 00:00:22,825
where I play D&D and XCOM.

7
00:00:23,852 --> 00:00:26,433
I've been doing analytics since the 90s.

8
00:00:26,714 --> 00:00:27,854
We had many names.

9
00:00:28,014 --> 00:00:29,455
We called it business intelligence.

10
00:00:29,495 --> 00:00:31,677
We called it data science, data mining.

11
00:00:32,457 --> 00:00:34,299
At its core, it's always about the same thing.

12
00:00:34,959 --> 00:00:36,220
We're trying to answer questions,

13
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:37,901
and we're trying to find insights

14
00:00:38,361 --> 00:00:39,222
that can help the business.

15
00:00:40,923 --> 00:00:42,904
I'm currently answering questions

16
00:00:43,184 --> 00:00:44,886
and finding insights at SocialPoint,

17
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:47,047
which is a take-two company in Barcelona.

18
00:00:48,468 --> 00:00:48,788
All right.

19
00:00:50,042 --> 00:00:50,663
Why are we here?

20
00:00:51,344 --> 00:00:52,887
Less of a philosophical question,

21
00:00:52,967 --> 00:00:54,390
more of a specifical question.

22
00:00:55,231 --> 00:00:58,637
We're here to equip you with analytics examples,

23
00:00:59,358 --> 00:01:01,542
things that we've done, mainly at SocialPoint,

24
00:01:01,622 --> 00:01:02,624
and things that you can use.

25
00:01:03,376 --> 00:01:03,936
in your games.

26
00:01:04,157 --> 00:01:07,979
Now, these examples that we chose for the presentation

27
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:10,901
are examples you can use in any size studio.

28
00:01:11,502 --> 00:01:13,263
They can work with a single game studio,

29
00:01:13,283 --> 00:01:14,644
whether you're indie or not.

30
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:18,527
Multi-game studios, I've done this at SocialPoint.

31
00:01:18,547 --> 00:01:20,789
Some of these things I've also implemented at Plarium,

32
00:01:21,269 --> 00:01:22,990
which is another gaming company I've worked at.

33
00:01:23,551 --> 00:01:27,193
And I've even implemented some of these best practices

34
00:01:27,293 --> 00:01:29,715
in companies that do mobile apps and didn't do games.

35
00:01:31,295 --> 00:01:33,676
We are here to learn from some of our mistakes.

36
00:01:33,956 --> 00:01:36,398
Hopefully it can save you guys some headache and some money.

37
00:01:37,198 --> 00:01:39,159
And we'll talk about some of the things that we've done

38
00:01:39,379 --> 00:01:41,060
at SocialPoint that didn't work too well,

39
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,241
or things that we are doing differently.

40
00:01:44,462 --> 00:01:47,344
And we are not here to make you analytics experts.

41
00:01:48,004 --> 00:01:50,045
I'm sorry, but that might take a bit more than an hour.

42
00:01:51,406 --> 00:01:51,806
All right.

43
00:01:53,767 --> 00:01:57,129
Our story begins, as many stories begin, with a company.

44
00:01:57,929 --> 00:02:00,011
Take two acquired SocialPoint.

45
00:02:00,839 --> 00:02:06,361
at 2017, then SocialPoint began a strong focus on growth.

46
00:02:07,142 --> 00:02:10,383
They brought in heads of product from Rovio, from King,

47
00:02:10,443 --> 00:02:11,964
the roster of heads of product,

48
00:02:12,004 --> 00:02:14,665
which is basically our equivalent of a studio head,

49
00:02:14,685 --> 00:02:16,586
has grown a lot.

50
00:02:17,306 --> 00:02:20,228
I joined the company on March, about a year ago.

51
00:02:20,788 --> 00:02:22,729
This is me on my first day, so happy.

52
00:02:24,068 --> 00:02:26,468
And the events that we will be focusing on

53
00:02:26,528 --> 00:02:29,389
for this presentation are the events that transpired

54
00:02:29,429 --> 00:02:32,290
between my joining and this here presentation.

55
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:33,650
All right?

56
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:35,310
Okay.

57
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:36,971
What will we talk about?

58
00:02:37,751 --> 00:02:40,731
We will be talking about the dark side of analytics.

59
00:02:41,752 --> 00:02:43,592
Analytics can be very valuable.

60
00:02:44,452 --> 00:02:46,653
I'm a data person, of course I believe in analytics,

61
00:02:46,713 --> 00:02:49,633
but there also can be a very negative side

62
00:02:49,653 --> 00:02:50,374
if you do it wrong.

63
00:02:51,154 --> 00:02:51,874
And it has a cost.

64
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:55,628
For example, one of the discussions we're currently having

65
00:02:55,688 --> 00:02:58,389
in SocialPoint is about, should we be A-B testing?

66
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:01,330
A-B testing is a practice, for those who do not know,

67
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:04,072
is a practice of, for example, taking a game,

68
00:03:05,032 --> 00:03:07,434
implementing changes, and then releasing the game

69
00:03:08,214 --> 00:03:10,475
with the unchanged version and the changed version,

70
00:03:11,076 --> 00:03:13,837
and randomly sampling people into one of the two versions.

71
00:03:14,417 --> 00:03:16,678
This lets you compare side by side

72
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,840
what is the real impact of the changes.

73
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,121
Are people in the new version?

74
00:03:22,007 --> 00:03:24,548
buying more, retaining better, converting better.

75
00:03:25,068 --> 00:03:25,888
That's an A-B test.

76
00:03:26,669 --> 00:03:28,249
Why not A-B test everything?

77
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:30,610
Because it costs money and time.

78
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:33,211
When I put out a new version, I need to wait.

79
00:03:34,071 --> 00:03:35,191
I need to wait for the results.

80
00:03:35,332 --> 00:03:37,492
I need to wait for enough users to come in

81
00:03:38,132 --> 00:03:39,953
for my analysis to be significant.

82
00:03:40,773 --> 00:03:42,554
And that means that I'm slowing down the game.

83
00:03:43,398 --> 00:03:44,839
If the game wants to run very quickly,

84
00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:46,279
if the game wants to release versions

85
00:03:46,339 --> 00:03:47,480
and move on to the next thing,

86
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,060
sometimes more data is not the answer.

87
00:03:50,881 --> 00:03:52,481
So that is the dark side of analytics.

88
00:03:52,501 --> 00:03:55,082
We will talk mainly about mistakes we've done

89
00:03:55,742 --> 00:03:56,502
and things you can avoid.

90
00:03:57,863 --> 00:04:00,183
All right, tracking user actions.

91
00:04:00,343 --> 00:04:02,784
We will talk about tracking user action.

92
00:04:02,864 --> 00:04:07,145
By tracking, I mean collecting information about logins,

93
00:04:08,036 --> 00:04:12,840
purchases, battles, level ups, all those events that happen in the game,

94
00:04:13,521 --> 00:04:16,743
and we collect that information so that we can analyze what happens.

95
00:04:17,464 --> 00:04:22,868
Now, this can be less painful if we do some of the things that I will show you today.

96
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,912
Playing levels without players. It can be done.

97
00:04:27,312 --> 00:04:31,615
You can have a level played without users. It can actually be very beneficial.

98
00:04:32,136 --> 00:04:35,539
And I will show you how we did it at SocialPoint and why we had to do it.

99
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:38,349
Basically we had a problem we needed to solve.

100
00:04:39,349 --> 00:04:42,812
And I will talk about testing, specifically A-B testing.

101
00:04:42,892 --> 00:04:46,094
I will talk about testing with small audiences.

102
00:04:46,114 --> 00:04:47,856
It can be a new game that you're releasing

103
00:04:48,456 --> 00:04:50,398
and doesn't have three million downloads,

104
00:04:50,918 --> 00:04:52,299
or it can be a new feature that you're doing

105
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:54,561
for players at level 24 on the third dragon.

106
00:04:57,561 --> 00:05:02,265
So you might have a small audience and statistics doesn't like small audiences.

107
00:05:02,325 --> 00:05:05,587
So I'll show you some hacks that you can implement so

108
00:05:05,607 --> 00:05:07,809
you can still use A-B tests in those scenarios.

109
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:12,092
Okay, about the cases that I will discuss.

110
00:05:12,733 --> 00:05:14,834
These are cases from my personal experience.

111
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:19,338
They apply, like I said, to many studios and many games.

112
00:05:20,568 --> 00:05:22,029
I will try to speak mainly English.

113
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:26,372
I'll try to avoid any terms that are too technical,

114
00:05:26,512 --> 00:05:29,934
too deep, but I will be touching on many frameworks

115
00:05:30,594 --> 00:05:32,736
from business and from data,

116
00:05:32,896 --> 00:05:35,718
and analytics is a very quickly evolving field.

117
00:05:36,198 --> 00:05:38,139
When I do introduce a concept,

118
00:05:38,179 --> 00:05:39,440
I will try to explain what it is.

119
00:05:40,525 --> 00:05:41,865
I will not go too deeply into it.

120
00:05:42,105 --> 00:05:44,687
My presentation will have a deep reference.

121
00:05:44,767 --> 00:05:46,367
When we upload it onto the website,

122
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:48,668
you can go there and you can find descriptions

123
00:05:48,728 --> 00:05:50,289
of most of the things that we'll discuss today.

124
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:51,510
All right?

125
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,852
Lastly, there may be some assembly required.

126
00:05:56,752 --> 00:05:59,153
What I want to do today is to equip you with things

127
00:05:59,173 --> 00:06:00,994
that you can do in your games,

128
00:06:01,154 --> 00:06:03,355
and I want you to be able to go to your analytics teams,

129
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,456
whether they're in-house or vendor,

130
00:06:06,076 --> 00:06:07,497
and say, build me this.

131
00:06:08,585 --> 00:06:11,147
but you will still need to work with analytics people

132
00:06:11,407 --> 00:06:12,048
to get this done.

133
00:06:13,529 --> 00:06:15,651
Or in the immortal words of Ikea,

134
00:06:16,092 --> 00:06:17,573
screwdriver, screwdriver, hammer.

135
00:06:19,035 --> 00:06:20,336
All right, let's get cooking.

136
00:06:21,097 --> 00:06:23,739
This is, by the way, thanks to the Tasty Town,

137
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:25,201
our team, that's one of our games,

138
00:06:25,941 --> 00:06:27,423
and they made sure to splash some color

139
00:06:27,503 --> 00:06:28,364
into the presentation.

140
00:06:29,525 --> 00:06:30,566
We'll also have some dragons.

141
00:06:32,112 --> 00:06:34,733
Okay, SocialPoint, why did we have to start this?

142
00:06:34,773 --> 00:06:36,574
Why did we have to go into this adventure

143
00:06:36,694 --> 00:06:39,155
and find ways to use data differently?

144
00:06:39,575 --> 00:06:41,776
SocialPoint was using data long before I came.

145
00:06:41,836 --> 00:06:43,577
SocialPoint has been around for about 10 years,

146
00:06:44,217 --> 00:06:44,757
even more now.

147
00:06:45,397 --> 00:06:47,778
So data was there, why did we have to change things?

148
00:06:47,858 --> 00:06:50,520
Where did all these challenges come from?

149
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,282
SocialPoint during 2019, after the acquisition

150
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:57,683
with the new roster of heads of product,

151
00:06:58,143 --> 00:07:00,284
faced several dramatic changes.

152
00:07:00,544 --> 00:07:01,304
That really had to...

153
00:07:02,315 --> 00:07:04,596
We had to redefine a lot of the ways we were doing things.

154
00:07:05,277 --> 00:07:08,659
First thing that happened was we had five games going into 2018.

155
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,842
And during 2018, we had 23 games launched.

156
00:07:12,622 --> 00:07:13,663
Some were in development.

157
00:07:13,763 --> 00:07:15,244
Some were launching and dying.

158
00:07:15,324 --> 00:07:16,965
Some were being replaced.

159
00:07:17,205 --> 00:07:21,689
But we had pretty much five times the amount of games

160
00:07:21,729 --> 00:07:23,390
that we were ready to handle.

161
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,031
And I'll give you a hint.

162
00:07:25,371 --> 00:07:27,653
Analytics did not have five times the headcount

163
00:07:28,413 --> 00:07:28,934
or the budget.

164
00:07:29,034 --> 00:07:30,655
So we had to find a way to make it work.

165
00:07:31,501 --> 00:07:34,063
Another thing that happened is we switched from having

166
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:37,645
a company that's very well optimized on live games.

167
00:07:38,145 --> 00:07:40,427
Social Point had games, they had millions of users,

168
00:07:40,447 --> 00:07:43,389
they had money, and we were trying to do something

169
00:07:43,789 --> 00:07:46,111
that was very different, which is release a lot of games

170
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,653
with very small teams, two people teams.

171
00:07:49,213 --> 00:07:50,774
Sometimes those two people were engineers,

172
00:07:50,814 --> 00:07:52,575
they didn't even have an artist or a designer,

173
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:54,877
and do things very quickly.

174
00:07:55,537 --> 00:07:58,259
Have an assembly line of games that keep launching

175
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,280
and learning and improving.

176
00:08:01,091 --> 00:08:03,240
The other thing we needed to do was really change

177
00:08:03,742 --> 00:08:05,048
how quickly we answer questions.

178
00:08:05,829 --> 00:08:07,290
We had to be able to answer questions.

179
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:10,030
When you have a game that has three major versions

180
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:14,052
in a week and launches, and next week launches globally,

181
00:08:14,432 --> 00:08:16,112
and then goes from iOS to Android,

182
00:08:16,552 --> 00:08:18,093
you have to be able to keep up with the game.

183
00:08:18,113 --> 00:08:20,994
You cannot be demanding the game to slow down

184
00:08:21,074 --> 00:08:22,194
so that you can give them answers.

185
00:08:22,214 --> 00:08:24,335
You have to find a way to work within that constraint,

186
00:08:24,995 --> 00:08:26,655
which was something that was quite new to us.

187
00:08:27,295 --> 00:08:29,576
We had games that were much bigger

188
00:08:29,596 --> 00:08:30,636
and we had much more data.

189
00:08:30,656 --> 00:08:32,637
It was usually a different case.

190
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:36,172
The last thing we had to do was, like I said,

191
00:08:36,372 --> 00:08:40,154
the team didn't expand as the portfolio expanded.

192
00:08:40,555 --> 00:08:42,416
So we had a lot more games.

193
00:08:43,176 --> 00:08:46,678
Before that, before 2018, every game had an analyst.

194
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:49,720
Which by the way, I strongly recommend if you can do it,

195
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,483
always have someone in your game team that is doing data.

196
00:08:54,023 --> 00:08:55,564
If that person goes to bed at night

197
00:08:55,844 --> 00:08:57,625
thinking about the questions in the game,

198
00:08:57,805 --> 00:08:59,246
living the game, playing the game,

199
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:00,707
playing the competitor games,

200
00:09:01,227 --> 00:09:02,828
that will bring you a lot of value.

201
00:09:03,821 --> 00:09:06,622
We data people work best when we're part of the product team.

202
00:09:06,942 --> 00:09:08,522
That's when we understand the real problems

203
00:09:08,542 --> 00:09:09,262
that need to be solved.

204
00:09:09,903 --> 00:09:11,983
But when you have 23 games,

205
00:09:12,603 --> 00:09:13,984
some of them have two people teams,

206
00:09:14,044 --> 00:09:16,424
and some of them run and have multiple versions every week,

207
00:09:17,065 --> 00:09:18,565
you don't have an analyst per game.

208
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,826
We had to change the structure.

209
00:09:20,886 --> 00:09:23,386
We had to create a pool of analysts

210
00:09:23,446 --> 00:09:25,047
that work like internal consultants

211
00:09:25,727 --> 00:09:26,847
just to be able to keep up.

212
00:09:27,127 --> 00:09:28,648
And that's something that was

213
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:34,249
a compromise. We had a very hard time with that. We really wanted to leave the games.

214
00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:39,110
We wanted to be living in the games going to everything that the game was doing and

215
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:43,891
being forced to work on multiple games at the same time was something that was a bit

216
00:09:43,911 --> 00:09:48,032
of a compromise. But it was also something that was very agile and made a lot of sense

217
00:09:48,052 --> 00:09:53,573
for the company. All right. So why? Why did all this happen? Why did the games

218
00:09:54,747 --> 00:09:58,208
So many games come out, why do we have to work in this way?

219
00:09:58,968 --> 00:10:01,450
The reason behind it is that SocialPoint adopted

220
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,911
a lean startup approach to games.

221
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:06,172
Those of you who are not familiar with the lean startup,

222
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:08,473
the lean startup is a methodology.

223
00:10:09,133 --> 00:10:09,973
It's a lot of things.

224
00:10:10,133 --> 00:10:12,794
It's probably one of the most impactful movements.

225
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:16,360
in how we do startups or how we build businesses

226
00:10:17,081 --> 00:10:19,142
with big variants.

227
00:10:19,842 --> 00:10:21,283
But in game terms, it's this.

228
00:10:21,703 --> 00:10:23,644
I joined SocialPoint on my first month there.

229
00:10:24,144 --> 00:10:25,444
I met my colleagues from Take-Two.

230
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:26,925
And we had this conversation.

231
00:10:27,505 --> 00:10:29,386
They were talking about launching Red Dead Redemption.

232
00:10:30,747 --> 00:10:32,688
The way you create a Red Dead Redemption,

233
00:10:33,468 --> 00:10:35,849
a lot of the decisions about design,

234
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,630
about difficulty, about content,

235
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:39,891
those decisions are made before the game is shipped.

236
00:10:41,085 --> 00:10:43,267
All of my games, I make the decisions

237
00:10:43,487 --> 00:10:44,368
after I hit the market.

238
00:10:45,049 --> 00:10:47,811
Theme, difficulty, levels, balancing, content,

239
00:10:48,711 --> 00:10:50,513
all of these things are things that I can change

240
00:10:50,613 --> 00:10:52,134
and I should change and I do change

241
00:10:52,795 --> 00:10:53,816
after the game launches.

242
00:10:54,596 --> 00:10:56,898
Lean Startup is a methodology that really helps

243
00:10:57,378 --> 00:10:58,880
when you're creating a product

244
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,522
that you're gonna learn by having it being used.

245
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,711
That's a very good framework for that.

246
00:11:04,371 --> 00:11:06,613
Another thing that it does is really helps you minimize

247
00:11:07,074 --> 00:11:07,854
the cost of failure.

248
00:11:08,495 --> 00:11:09,956
If you don't know about the Lean Startup,

249
00:11:10,676 --> 00:11:12,698
I strongly recommend you read these books.

250
00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:16,581
If you have the time, I think it's gonna be worth your while.

251
00:11:16,621 --> 00:11:17,982
These are the two books I buy,

252
00:11:18,663 --> 00:11:19,743
every one on my team has them.

253
00:11:20,164 --> 00:11:21,064
Every team that I joined,

254
00:11:21,084 --> 00:11:22,826
these are the first two books that I buy everyone.

255
00:11:24,367 --> 00:11:27,890
The idea is, in its core, to have a lot of focus.

256
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,632
There's gonna be links to this in the reference as well.

257
00:11:31,396 --> 00:11:33,177
Sadly, I don't have any equity in the books,

258
00:11:33,277 --> 00:11:37,220
but they have impacted a lot how I do my job

259
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,021
and how we work as a company.

260
00:11:39,802 --> 00:11:42,083
I'm gonna do a very short explanation

261
00:11:42,223 --> 00:11:44,205
of what Lean Startup is in our industry.

262
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:49,246
The most prominent voice of doing lean startup

263
00:11:49,366 --> 00:11:51,066
in the games industry is Supercell.

264
00:11:51,786 --> 00:11:55,047
Supercell have a lot of speeches about this,

265
00:11:55,167 --> 00:11:56,207
a lot of public talks.

266
00:11:56,267 --> 00:11:58,008
This is a strategy that they have adopted

267
00:11:58,568 --> 00:12:00,108
and they know better than me to say how,

268
00:12:00,288 --> 00:12:01,709
so this is a link for what they do.

269
00:12:02,669 --> 00:12:05,870
The idea is when you're doing a lean startup approach

270
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:09,051
to product design, you have a loop of stages

271
00:12:09,491 --> 00:12:10,731
that you keep doing very quickly.

272
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:11,871
You build something.

273
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:15,421
like a new maze, then you release it,

274
00:12:15,581 --> 00:12:17,262
you measure how people are playing that maze,

275
00:12:17,442 --> 00:12:20,044
or a new level, or a new game, and then you learn.

276
00:12:20,885 --> 00:12:22,145
You see if people are enjoying this,

277
00:12:22,206 --> 00:12:24,087
if people are not enjoying this, where it works.

278
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:26,468
Then you build something else, and you keep that going.

279
00:12:27,229 --> 00:12:29,170
Where analytics comes into this is,

280
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:32,553
analytics really helps you find out what doesn't work.

281
00:12:33,173 --> 00:12:34,814
The key thing about being lean,

282
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,362
is not having the secret to success.

283
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:40,184
It doesn't necessarily mean all your games will be amazing.

284
00:12:40,624 --> 00:12:41,565
What it does mean is,

285
00:12:41,985 --> 00:12:43,927
you'll find out very quickly what doesn't work.

286
00:12:44,627 --> 00:12:46,208
And this is really, really important.

287
00:12:47,189 --> 00:12:50,792
You can take a game that runs for two years development

288
00:12:50,952 --> 00:12:52,053
with a 20 people team,

289
00:12:52,673 --> 00:12:54,455
and we had this happen in SocialPoint,

290
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:57,497
is released, and then we found some of the problems we had,

291
00:12:57,997 --> 00:13:00,099
or you can find that out with two people in three months.

292
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,911
And then if that doesn't work, try something else.

293
00:13:04,192 --> 00:13:06,172
We're trying new genres, we're trying match threes,

294
00:13:06,212 --> 00:13:07,853
we're trying different themes.

295
00:13:08,733 --> 00:13:10,954
That doesn't work, you wanna switch to a different genre,

296
00:13:10,974 --> 00:13:13,335
you wanna do word puzzles, take the same theme and do that.

297
00:13:13,775 --> 00:13:16,497
But find out very quickly, if you're not reaching that,

298
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:20,038
whatever your goal is, day one 60% retention,

299
00:13:20,518 --> 00:13:23,640
conversion of 2%, whatever you're aiming for,

300
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,601
the lean startup is a way to find out very quickly,

301
00:13:27,121 --> 00:13:29,202
are you getting there, are you getting closer, or not?

302
00:13:30,263 --> 00:13:32,324
And if not, then you kill it and you move to something else.

303
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:34,865
So the idea is to fail fast.

304
00:13:35,605 --> 00:13:36,746
Saves you time and saves you money.

305
00:13:38,006 --> 00:13:39,987
All right, Lean Analytics.

306
00:13:40,867 --> 00:13:43,388
Lean Analytics is a school within the Lean startup.

307
00:13:44,188 --> 00:13:45,769
And this is what we're gonna talk about today.

308
00:13:47,281 --> 00:13:49,663
I'm going to say a few very trivial things now.

309
00:13:50,003 --> 00:13:52,445
What I'm gonna say now in this part of the talk

310
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,486
is going to be things that are very common sense.

311
00:13:54,847 --> 00:13:56,688
None of this is rocket science.

312
00:13:56,788 --> 00:13:57,889
All of these things that I'm saying

313
00:13:57,909 --> 00:13:59,630
will sound very reasonable,

314
00:13:59,771 --> 00:14:01,172
and I'm not telling you anything new.

315
00:14:02,112 --> 00:14:04,134
But this is the part where I'm talking

316
00:14:04,174 --> 00:14:05,195
about things we did wrong.

317
00:14:05,815 --> 00:14:06,996
All of these things are based

318
00:14:07,901 --> 00:14:09,562
on things that we did not implement correctly,

319
00:14:10,022 --> 00:14:11,804
things that we failed to do at SocialPoint

320
00:14:11,844 --> 00:14:13,124
and other companies that I've worked at.

321
00:14:13,565 --> 00:14:15,906
So it's really worthwhile to take these things

322
00:14:15,966 --> 00:14:16,607
and adopt them.

323
00:14:16,687 --> 00:14:19,108
This is a discipline that you have to keep.

324
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:20,869
And I'll show you in a minute

325
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:23,251
how we keep ourselves very disciplined.

326
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:26,353
Measure what matters.

327
00:14:27,214 --> 00:14:30,235
This is a very nice philosophical saying,

328
00:14:30,275 --> 00:14:31,676
but what's behind it is this.

329
00:14:32,257 --> 00:14:33,598
SocialPoint at the beginning of 2018

330
00:14:34,718 --> 00:14:36,279
had more than a thousand metrics.

331
00:14:37,062 --> 00:14:39,083
We were using more than a thousand metrics

332
00:14:39,584 --> 00:14:40,884
to measure if the game was doing well.

333
00:14:41,785 --> 00:14:43,046
We had too much data.

334
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:46,088
We had so much data, when you asked a game designer

335
00:14:46,108 --> 00:14:48,089
what they look at, every game designer

336
00:14:48,129 --> 00:14:49,129
was looking at different things.

337
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,952
What we did was, we really narrowed it down.

338
00:14:53,032 --> 00:14:55,013
We asked what really is important?

339
00:14:55,493 --> 00:14:57,374
Of all these things, what makes the cut?

340
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,195
What are the super KPIs?

341
00:14:59,736 --> 00:15:01,537
The core KPIs that we have to know.

342
00:15:02,177 --> 00:15:03,158
When you're driving a car,

343
00:15:03,995 --> 00:15:05,275
You only know what you need to know.

344
00:15:05,335 --> 00:15:07,396
The dashboard doesn't give you everything you need to know.

345
00:15:08,016 --> 00:15:09,616
Air pressure, the heat of the ground.

346
00:15:09,756 --> 00:15:10,977
You don't need to know all these things

347
00:15:10,997 --> 00:15:11,797
when you're doing that.

348
00:15:12,297 --> 00:15:14,538
If there's a problem, we drill down.

349
00:15:15,218 --> 00:15:16,698
But we've been able to narrow it down

350
00:15:16,758 --> 00:15:20,640
to retention, conversion, LTV.

351
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,961
We've been able to talk about revenues.

352
00:15:24,121 --> 00:15:26,081
And when we talk about a very specific cost,

353
00:15:26,101 --> 00:15:27,782
by the way, some things that didn't make the cut,

354
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,222
second session retention.

355
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:33,012
We actually don't have that on the first view of a game.

356
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:34,673
When we talk about is the game good,

357
00:15:35,154 --> 00:15:37,255
we talk about day one retention, day three retention,

358
00:15:37,295 --> 00:15:39,617
but we don't talk about a session granularity.

359
00:15:40,058 --> 00:15:42,319
Sometimes we don't even talk about a daily granularity.

360
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:43,661
We look at it on a weekly basis.

361
00:15:44,481 --> 00:15:46,783
This was a system that was designed for the executive team

362
00:15:47,524 --> 00:15:49,185
and really created a different conversation.

363
00:15:49,545 --> 00:15:52,047
And it changed the mode from bombarded

364
00:15:52,488 --> 00:15:54,169
with million reports and million metrics

365
00:15:54,209 --> 00:15:55,891
to really focusing on what's important.

366
00:15:56,811 --> 00:15:57,452
The other thing is,

367
00:15:58,622 --> 00:15:59,722
Don't develop what you can buy.

368
00:16:00,443 --> 00:16:02,283
Now this is really true for small companies

369
00:16:02,343 --> 00:16:03,683
and it's also true for big companies.

370
00:16:05,243 --> 00:16:08,284
We have a very strong data engineering team

371
00:16:08,444 --> 00:16:10,925
and we do do a lot of our tools in-house.

372
00:16:11,545 --> 00:16:12,745
We also have scientists.

373
00:16:12,865 --> 00:16:15,145
When I do A-B tests, it's my scientists

374
00:16:15,165 --> 00:16:16,186
who create the tools for that

375
00:16:16,946 --> 00:16:18,506
and my analysts benefit from that.

376
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:21,667
But even with that, there's things that I don't develop.

377
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:23,987
One of the things, one of the problems that we had

378
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:27,768
at SocialPoint, we had KPIs that were misbehaving.

379
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,822
We had a process that was getting data, for example,

380
00:16:31,102 --> 00:16:33,184
AppSlayer data about user attribution.

381
00:16:33,724 --> 00:16:36,266
This was data that was telling us which user came into the

382
00:16:36,307 --> 00:16:39,329
game through which marketing campaign, which was really key

383
00:16:39,349 --> 00:16:40,790
because we spend a lot of money in marketing,

384
00:16:40,871 --> 00:16:41,471
so we want to know.

385
00:16:42,612 --> 00:16:43,333
AppSlayer had a bug.

386
00:16:44,334 --> 00:16:45,695
Our process was the same process.

387
00:16:45,735 --> 00:16:48,037
We didn't get any notice about the process failing.

388
00:16:48,537 --> 00:16:50,979
But AppSlayer had a bug, I think, about four months ago.

389
00:16:52,325 --> 00:16:53,646
And they just gave us double the data.

390
00:16:54,126 --> 00:16:56,988
So we ran the same process, nothing failed, no red flags,

391
00:16:57,388 --> 00:16:58,809
and we got double the installations.

392
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,751
So either we were doing our job really, really good

393
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,553
at marketing, or something was wrong.

394
00:17:03,973 --> 00:17:05,374
This is called a business anomaly.

395
00:17:05,934 --> 00:17:08,396
By the way, business anomalies can happen for a good reason.

396
00:17:08,456 --> 00:17:12,159
It could be that a new market opens up for you

397
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:13,780
and users are really liking what you do,

398
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:16,081
but it means that the KPI is behaving

399
00:17:16,121 --> 00:17:17,122
not in the way you'd expect.

400
00:17:18,114 --> 00:17:20,115
You can develop this in-house or you can use a tool

401
00:17:20,295 --> 00:17:23,016
that does that and we're using Anodot for that.

402
00:17:23,176 --> 00:17:24,656
By the way, we're working with King,

403
00:17:25,076 --> 00:17:26,437
we have a center in Barcelona,

404
00:17:26,977 --> 00:17:28,898
which is the Business Incident Management Center,

405
00:17:28,938 --> 00:17:29,638
I believe it's called,

406
00:17:30,178 --> 00:17:31,399
and we're working with the people there

407
00:17:31,459 --> 00:17:32,639
to learn how they're doing it.

408
00:17:33,251 --> 00:17:35,292
Now this is king and social point.

409
00:17:35,332 --> 00:17:37,653
These are big companies and we're still benefiting

410
00:17:38,354 --> 00:17:40,275
from buying things and not developing them in-house.

411
00:17:40,335 --> 00:17:43,637
So if you're a small studio and you wanna have analytics,

412
00:17:43,857 --> 00:17:45,258
but you don't have an analytics team

413
00:17:45,358 --> 00:17:48,039
and it doesn't make sense for you to have analytics team,

414
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:49,700
use something like Delta DNA.

415
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,521
You can still have analytics.

416
00:17:51,961 --> 00:17:53,462
You don't need to create everything in-house.

417
00:17:54,122 --> 00:17:55,123
There's enough services.

418
00:17:55,143 --> 00:17:57,845
Use a cloud, you don't need to develop a cloud.

419
00:17:57,905 --> 00:17:58,805
The world's come a long way.

420
00:17:59,786 --> 00:18:00,066
All right.

421
00:18:01,621 --> 00:18:04,664
Focus on value, BMF, product market fit.

422
00:18:05,244 --> 00:18:07,626
Product market fit is a very fancy way to say

423
00:18:07,766 --> 00:18:10,909
in lean startup terms that work on things

424
00:18:10,949 --> 00:18:11,970
that people care about.

425
00:18:13,191 --> 00:18:14,051
I'll give you an example.

426
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,394
One of the things, one of the first researches

427
00:18:17,574 --> 00:18:19,015
that I saw from the data science team,

428
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:21,638
I came into Social Point, what are we working on?

429
00:18:21,678 --> 00:18:22,719
And I talked to the scientists.

430
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:25,701
One of them presented a model that was very clever.

431
00:18:25,901 --> 00:18:28,864
He was analyzing sentiment analysis.

432
00:18:28,924 --> 00:18:30,185
So how people were reacting

433
00:18:30,905 --> 00:18:32,246
to our games, to our versions.

434
00:18:32,346 --> 00:18:36,949
He took data from story views, social media, customer center.

435
00:18:37,009 --> 00:18:39,271
He built a very robust system that

436
00:18:39,311 --> 00:18:42,613
shows if people have a positive or negative response

437
00:18:42,673 --> 00:18:44,554
to versions, to changes that we're making.

438
00:18:45,215 --> 00:18:47,216
Amazing, super interesting.

439
00:18:47,737 --> 00:18:49,518
No one ever used it for anything.

440
00:18:50,238 --> 00:18:51,299
He did that analysis.

441
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:52,140
It took a lot of time.

442
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,060
It took a lot of data.

443
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,261
It was very clever.

444
00:18:54,821 --> 00:18:56,422
No one in the games was waiting for that.

445
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:59,612
No one in the games was using that as part of the decision

446
00:18:59,652 --> 00:19:02,953
making, it just sat there and became a very good article for

447
00:19:02,993 --> 00:19:07,816
the university. But that's it. So when you work on things, make

448
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:11,698
sure there's a value attached to that. There is a caveat to

449
00:19:11,738 --> 00:19:14,239
that a lot of the things you do in analytics are a leap of

450
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:19,541
faith. I'm not sure this will move the money needle. I'm not

451
00:19:19,641 --> 00:19:22,163
sure whether this will be something that is going to be

452
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:25,484
major impact on the game.

453
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:28,954
But even though you choose sometimes things

454
00:19:28,974 --> 00:19:31,197
that are a bit of a risk, make sure that you ask yourself,

455
00:19:31,918 --> 00:19:33,440
is this something, is this the best thing

456
00:19:33,481 --> 00:19:34,202
I could be doing now?

457
00:19:34,983 --> 00:19:37,666
This is true when you have 26 people like we have,

458
00:19:37,707 --> 00:19:38,988
and it's more true when you have one.

459
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:41,572
What is the most important answer?

460
00:19:42,492 --> 00:19:43,633
I should be working on right now.

461
00:19:44,213 --> 00:19:46,775
Because if I'm working on the impact of the new maze,

462
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,516
or the new island, or the new dragon,

463
00:19:48,996 --> 00:19:51,978
I'm not working on how to monetize existing users.

464
00:19:52,579 --> 00:19:54,720
So always make sure that you're very disciplined,

465
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,002
and I'll show you how we do that in social points.

466
00:19:58,983 --> 00:20:00,804
One last thing, another trivial bit.

467
00:20:01,905 --> 00:20:02,845
Remember the big picture.

468
00:20:03,706 --> 00:20:04,927
When you're working on problems,

469
00:20:05,267 --> 00:20:07,869
we have a very strong tendency as people

470
00:20:08,489 --> 00:20:10,030
to focus on that problem.

471
00:20:10,769 --> 00:20:13,316
We were doing a morality analysis for one of our games.

472
00:20:14,515 --> 00:20:17,037
We had to intervene and make sure that analysis

473
00:20:17,117 --> 00:20:18,478
applies to other games.

474
00:20:18,898 --> 00:20:20,899
We were doing a new game with match threes.

475
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,621
We had a game, a version that we launched

476
00:20:24,102 --> 00:20:25,223
for a game that we killed.

477
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:28,405
The only reason we did that was not because

478
00:20:28,465 --> 00:20:29,646
that game would benefit from that,

479
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:30,747
but we would get some learning

480
00:20:31,267 --> 00:20:32,348
for things we do in the future.

481
00:20:32,808 --> 00:20:34,549
Even if you only have one game in your life,

482
00:20:34,709 --> 00:20:36,271
I really hope you'll be making more games.

483
00:20:36,891 --> 00:20:39,233
Always remember, take something from it.

484
00:20:39,933 --> 00:20:43,015
Always try to do things in a way that benefits.

485
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:49,042
other games. When you answer a question, who buys? Try to answer that question in a way that you can

486
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:54,468
rewrite or rerun it in other games. This is really important when you're running analytics in a

487
00:20:54,508 --> 00:21:01,195
company. All right. So how do we at SocialPoint make sure that we don't lose focus? How do we

488
00:21:01,235 --> 00:21:03,017
make sure that when we're working on something,

489
00:21:03,756 --> 00:21:04,597
It's something interesting.

490
00:21:04,738 --> 00:21:06,400
Now I will say this, due diligence,

491
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:08,924
I had two startups that were amazing

492
00:21:09,325 --> 00:21:10,346
and would have changed the world.

493
00:21:10,567 --> 00:21:13,010
I created an AI that plays games

494
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:15,434
and does everything for you and was remarkable

495
00:21:16,075 --> 00:21:16,696
and no one bought it.

496
00:21:17,725 --> 00:21:22,790
Both of my startups ended as being very, very good experiences, but no one used them.

497
00:21:23,071 --> 00:21:27,175
Just because you think something is interesting, just because you think someone is going to

498
00:21:27,215 --> 00:21:28,836
use this, that's not the way.

499
00:21:29,257 --> 00:21:31,819
You need to make sure that you measure if someone is using this.

500
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,201
And this is how we do that at SocialPoint.

501
00:21:35,182 --> 00:21:39,326
The chart that you're seeing here, remember I told you we took the super KPIs?

502
00:21:40,381 --> 00:21:42,864
And we created a dashboard for the super KPIs.

503
00:21:43,525 --> 00:21:45,548
It was originally intended for 20 people,

504
00:21:46,069 --> 00:21:47,911
just in the executive team and a bit more.

505
00:21:48,552 --> 00:21:50,615
And it was very widely adopted in the company.

506
00:21:51,556 --> 00:21:53,759
Just to keep in mind, the whole company is about 300 people.

507
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:57,023
So we had a very wide adoption of the tool.

508
00:21:57,043 --> 00:21:58,405
Now this is an internal product.

509
00:21:59,356 --> 00:22:01,538
I don't really have monetization other than my salary,

510
00:22:01,618 --> 00:22:04,040
but I am looking all the time

511
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,842
at how many active users are there.

512
00:22:06,402 --> 00:22:07,703
And when I release a new version

513
00:22:07,803 --> 00:22:09,445
for something that I develop internally,

514
00:22:10,065 --> 00:22:11,286
I make sure that people use it.

515
00:22:11,366 --> 00:22:12,748
And if they don't, I ask why.

516
00:22:13,508 --> 00:22:14,129
What did I miss?

517
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:15,870
The other thing we do is,

518
00:22:15,971 --> 00:22:17,612
and this is specifically for analysis,

519
00:22:18,052 --> 00:22:21,595
this is actually the same classification tree that we use.

520
00:22:22,016 --> 00:22:22,837
I know it's a bit small,

521
00:22:22,877 --> 00:22:25,579
but basically it starts with, is it actionable?

522
00:22:26,953 --> 00:22:28,494
First thing you want to do when you start this,

523
00:22:28,834 --> 00:22:29,715
is this actionable?

524
00:22:29,795 --> 00:22:30,695
Is someone going to use this?

525
00:22:30,755 --> 00:22:32,537
Is this going to tie into a process?

526
00:22:33,117 --> 00:22:34,878
Sentiment analysis is brilliant.

527
00:22:35,078 --> 00:22:35,719
Is it actionable?

528
00:22:36,259 --> 00:22:37,039
No, don't do it.

529
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,221
If you know someone is going to use it,

530
00:22:39,301 --> 00:22:40,822
if customer service is going to use it,

531
00:22:40,922 --> 00:22:42,203
if marketing is going to use it,

532
00:22:42,723 --> 00:22:44,544
community managers, yes,

533
00:22:45,185 --> 00:22:47,466
but first validate that it's actionable.

534
00:22:48,171 --> 00:22:51,552
Then ask, does this affect a core KPI 25%?

535
00:22:52,193 --> 00:22:55,854
The focus that we got because we defined

536
00:22:55,914 --> 00:22:58,355
a very close group of KPIs

537
00:22:58,996 --> 00:23:01,237
is a focus that serves us for everything.

538
00:23:01,717 --> 00:23:03,137
Now, whenever I have a conversation

539
00:23:03,177 --> 00:23:04,418
with anyone in the company,

540
00:23:05,058 --> 00:23:06,479
the first thing we will ask is this,

541
00:23:07,099 --> 00:23:07,899
what are you aiming to do?

542
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,701
Is this something that's gonna affect a core KPI?

543
00:23:11,001 --> 00:23:14,142
If it doesn't affect conversion, LTV, retention, revenues,

544
00:23:14,322 --> 00:23:15,483
why are we having this conversation?

545
00:23:16,463 --> 00:23:16,723
CPI.

546
00:23:18,247 --> 00:23:19,668
So this is basically how we do this.

547
00:23:19,868 --> 00:23:23,110
We go through these stages and we classify all our work

548
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:26,353
in analytics across the teams, engineering, analysts,

549
00:23:26,473 --> 00:23:29,435
data scientists, everything we do, we work around this

550
00:23:29,635 --> 00:23:32,577
and we always try to maximize how much

551
00:23:32,617 --> 00:23:33,778
of what we're doing is high impact.

552
00:23:34,619 --> 00:23:35,820
And it's a lot harder than it sounds.

553
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,242
It would sound trivial, just put people in the game teams

554
00:23:39,283 --> 00:23:40,343
and let the game teams work.

555
00:23:40,403 --> 00:23:42,405
The game teams sometimes ask questions

556
00:23:42,945 --> 00:23:44,086
that are very not interesting.

557
00:23:44,955 --> 00:23:46,376
Some game designer will ask,

558
00:23:46,516 --> 00:23:48,778
is the Halloween dragon better because it's orange or not?

559
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:51,880
Say I find an answer for that, what are you gonna change?

560
00:23:53,221 --> 00:23:54,662
Next year you're gonna do a different dragon,

561
00:23:54,722 --> 00:23:56,383
let's talk about it when we get to the next Halloween.

562
00:23:56,583 --> 00:23:57,584
Right now it's not applicable.

563
00:23:58,484 --> 00:24:00,505
So always make sure that there's something

564
00:24:00,545 --> 00:24:01,326
behind what you're doing.

565
00:24:02,347 --> 00:24:03,287
A lot harder than it sounds.

566
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:07,710
Okay, let's talk a bit about things that we're doing.

567
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:08,971
Things that were high impact,

568
00:24:09,271 --> 00:24:11,653
and things that did qualify as relevant,

569
00:24:12,273 --> 00:24:13,674
and change how we work in the company.

570
00:24:14,889 --> 00:24:18,111
So, take you back a few slides, we had a big problem.

571
00:24:18,751 --> 00:24:22,314
The company was basically going 5X on the number of games.

572
00:24:23,135 --> 00:24:24,916
Things had to happen very quickly.

573
00:24:25,877 --> 00:24:27,378
And one of the things that happened was

574
00:24:27,518 --> 00:24:30,040
we had a big problem with how we do tracking.

575
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,721
The company was already doing tracking.

576
00:24:32,241 --> 00:24:33,182
It was doing it very well.

577
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:34,963
The technology was there, architecture was there.

578
00:24:34,983 --> 00:24:36,884
It was not a problem of architecture.

579
00:24:37,325 --> 00:24:38,986
We had to change how we collect user data.

580
00:24:39,346 --> 00:24:41,928
I'm going to give you two things that we did to help that.

581
00:24:42,824 --> 00:24:45,045
The first one is what we did at social point.

582
00:24:45,085 --> 00:24:47,246
The second one, one core pack to rule them all

583
00:24:47,306 --> 00:24:48,746
is based on something we did at Plarium.

584
00:24:49,707 --> 00:24:50,087
All right.

585
00:24:51,667 --> 00:24:52,067
Tracking.

586
00:24:52,588 --> 00:24:54,188
So how does tracking work?

587
00:24:54,248 --> 00:24:55,649
And this is true for most games.

588
00:24:55,709 --> 00:24:57,689
It's a bit of a simplification, but bear with me.

589
00:24:58,870 --> 00:24:59,830
The game has a new feature.

590
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:01,411
Or there's a new game.

591
00:25:01,891 --> 00:25:03,111
Someone wants to release something,

592
00:25:03,151 --> 00:25:05,712
they want to do something seasonal, Halloween special.

593
00:25:06,352 --> 00:25:08,833
So we design it, we say this is design two.

594
00:25:09,527 --> 00:25:11,548
Bring in new users through virality.

595
00:25:11,608 --> 00:25:15,631
This is designed to convert or convert to a second purchase.

596
00:25:16,371 --> 00:25:17,132
Users who are buying.

597
00:25:17,192 --> 00:25:20,133
We align on a primary goal, and based on that,

598
00:25:20,173 --> 00:25:21,454
we define what we're gonna track.

599
00:25:22,495 --> 00:25:23,556
This is really important.

600
00:25:23,776 --> 00:25:26,097
What you track is a result of what you ask.

601
00:25:26,818 --> 00:25:28,319
If you don't know what you're trying to achieve,

602
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:29,980
don't start talking about what you wanna track,

603
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,242
because you will fall back into collecting everything.

604
00:25:33,682 --> 00:25:35,023
If someone tells you collect everything,

605
00:25:35,043 --> 00:25:37,345
we'll sort it out later, don't.

606
00:25:37,965 --> 00:25:38,205
All right.

607
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:41,591
I just angered half of my data people community.

608
00:25:42,171 --> 00:25:42,511
All right.

609
00:25:43,751 --> 00:25:44,472
I hope none of them are here.

610
00:25:45,512 --> 00:25:48,013
Okay, game implements the tracking.

611
00:25:48,073 --> 00:25:50,434
So we had a feature, we had a definition,

612
00:25:50,494 --> 00:25:52,455
we defined the events, then the game devs,

613
00:25:52,935 --> 00:25:55,656
every time the user buys this seasonal dragon,

614
00:25:56,276 --> 00:25:59,157
they write a row and they put that row somewhere.

615
00:25:59,177 --> 00:26:00,418
There's a file that gets sent.

616
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:03,459
Specifically for us, it was some folder in the cloud.

617
00:26:04,269 --> 00:26:07,651
Then the data engineering team takes that group of files

618
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:10,714
and make it into a table so the people can actually use it.

619
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:13,275
There's a lot of ways to do this.

620
00:26:13,495 --> 00:26:14,896
That's not the goal of this conversation.

621
00:26:14,976 --> 00:26:17,098
But this was a process that we were doing.

622
00:26:17,598 --> 00:26:18,919
The problem with this process is,

623
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,720
everything that the game does

624
00:26:21,241 --> 00:26:22,482
has to go through data engineering.

625
00:26:23,662 --> 00:26:26,144
Every time the game team wants to have a new feature,

626
00:26:26,404 --> 00:26:28,025
a new measure, a new event,

627
00:26:28,686 --> 00:26:30,267
they have to go through data engineering,

628
00:26:30,307 --> 00:26:32,168
which is a small team and works.

629
00:26:33,588 --> 00:26:35,090
for design for five games.

630
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:37,191
So that created a major bottleneck.

631
00:26:37,211 --> 00:26:39,053
We were actually delaying the launches of game.

632
00:26:39,093 --> 00:26:40,373
There were games that were coming out

633
00:26:41,034 --> 00:26:42,095
and not knowing what's happening.

634
00:26:42,135 --> 00:26:43,556
They had features that were being used

635
00:26:43,636 --> 00:26:44,837
and it wasn't written anywhere

636
00:26:45,317 --> 00:26:46,458
how many times it was being used

637
00:26:46,578 --> 00:26:47,679
because the tracking wasn't there.

638
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:50,201
And my engineers were super frustrated

639
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:51,322
because all they were doing was this,

640
00:26:51,922 --> 00:26:53,243
putting wires together.

641
00:26:53,323 --> 00:26:54,844
They had nothing that was interesting,

642
00:26:55,385 --> 00:26:56,866
no projects that had high impact.

643
00:26:56,886 --> 00:26:59,027
They were just there to configure wires.

644
00:26:59,708 --> 00:27:00,248
So we changed it.

645
00:27:01,632 --> 00:27:04,033
What we did was we implemented a change

646
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:05,994
that I'm gonna mention in a minute,

647
00:27:06,134 --> 00:27:08,054
and I'm gonna use some tech terms,

648
00:27:08,174 --> 00:27:10,476
but what we did was we just let the games run.

649
00:27:11,376 --> 00:27:12,697
Anything that the game reports,

650
00:27:12,877 --> 00:27:14,777
any data, any event that the game collects

651
00:27:15,298 --> 00:27:16,878
is automatically exposed as a table.

652
00:27:18,145 --> 00:27:19,286
And that was very big.

653
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:21,448
That let the games run very, very quickly,

654
00:27:21,468 --> 00:27:23,429
and it freed up the engineers.

655
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:25,331
What we did behind the scenes,

656
00:27:25,371 --> 00:27:26,732
and if you want to hear more about this,

657
00:27:27,393 --> 00:27:29,674
it will be in the references, or you can catch up to me,

658
00:27:29,715 --> 00:27:31,076
but what we did was we implemented

659
00:27:31,776 --> 00:27:33,398
a game-specific data lake.

660
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:36,220
We just created a database where they can get data,

661
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:40,664
and something that parses from raw events into tables,

662
00:27:41,144 --> 00:27:42,105
which is really not hard.

663
00:27:42,145 --> 00:27:43,066
It took us about two weeks.

664
00:27:44,407 --> 00:27:44,627
Okay.

665
00:27:46,188 --> 00:27:47,408
What did we do, what did we achieve?

666
00:27:47,449 --> 00:27:48,909
We eliminated a major bottleneck.

667
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:50,490
This is super simple.

668
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:51,491
This is not something that's,

669
00:27:51,651 --> 00:27:53,172
we didn't implement a new patent,

670
00:27:53,212 --> 00:27:54,772
we didn't change how the cloud works.

671
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:56,413
We just took that process,

672
00:27:57,534 --> 00:27:58,875
added some automation at the end,

673
00:27:58,935 --> 00:28:01,656
and made that very less painful.

674
00:28:02,516 --> 00:28:04,037
Games still need to develop code.

675
00:28:04,437 --> 00:28:07,419
Games still need to code tracking.

676
00:28:08,199 --> 00:28:09,760
If they want something to be recorded,

677
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,922
they still need to add that record to the action,

678
00:28:13,222 --> 00:28:14,803
but they don't longer depend on anyone else

679
00:28:14,843 --> 00:28:15,603
parsing that for them.

680
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:18,532
Data engineering became very, very happy

681
00:28:19,313 --> 00:28:20,794
because they were able to do dashboards

682
00:28:21,295 --> 00:28:22,316
like the one I just showed you.

683
00:28:22,736 --> 00:28:24,818
For the executive team, they were able to create

684
00:28:25,479 --> 00:28:27,220
new dashboards for video ads

685
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,022
to help our marketing teams and the games,

686
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:30,663
and they were working on projects

687
00:28:30,683 --> 00:28:31,905
that had a much higher impact.

688
00:28:34,203 --> 00:28:37,485
One thing to remember, game independence is really good.

689
00:28:37,865 --> 00:28:40,286
And I have, as we speak here,

690
00:28:40,306 --> 00:28:42,247
I have multiple games in Barcelona,

691
00:28:42,707 --> 00:28:44,528
creating tables that I know nothing about.

692
00:28:45,128 --> 00:28:46,249
As the data guy in the company,

693
00:28:46,269 --> 00:28:47,189
I have no idea what they're doing.

694
00:28:47,209 --> 00:28:48,410
They could create anything they want.

695
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:52,151
They could be doing it for word puzzles, match threes,

696
00:28:52,271 --> 00:28:54,052
they could be creating it for strategy games.

697
00:28:54,732 --> 00:28:55,353
I don't need to know.

698
00:28:56,433 --> 00:28:58,674
I will need to know when they have traction.

699
00:28:59,313 --> 00:29:02,394
When they get to a point where they were launched and they have enough users,

700
00:29:02,954 --> 00:29:05,455
that's when we have to bring them back into the fold

701
00:29:06,055 --> 00:29:08,556
and make sure that we do everything in an organized manner.

702
00:29:09,036 --> 00:29:10,736
Then I can guarantee they have quality,

703
00:29:11,376 --> 00:29:13,857
that their data is secured, that I'm logging what they're doing,

704
00:29:13,917 --> 00:29:15,277
that I can create things for them.

705
00:29:16,117 --> 00:29:18,118
Until that point, they have independence.

706
00:29:18,378 --> 00:29:20,618
Now this democracy is really good.

707
00:29:21,501 --> 00:29:25,423
But you have to be, it's not my problem anymore.

708
00:29:25,563 --> 00:29:27,564
It's still my problem, it's still my responsibility.

709
00:29:27,744 --> 00:29:29,225
I don't go out of the picture for that.

710
00:29:30,386 --> 00:29:33,407
Last thing, some things you don't do with yourself.

711
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:34,728
Don't DIY everything.

712
00:29:36,229 --> 00:29:38,130
It's really good that the games can create

713
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:40,431
their own tracking and collect user actions.

714
00:29:40,551 --> 00:29:41,412
This is fantastic.

715
00:29:41,432 --> 00:29:43,133
This is a very good example for something

716
00:29:43,633 --> 00:29:44,694
you wanna have the game do.

717
00:29:44,954 --> 00:29:46,675
Because they can run as fast as they can.

718
00:29:48,076 --> 00:29:49,637
The thing that you don't want them to do

719
00:29:49,677 --> 00:29:51,719
is you don't want them to set up their own architecture

720
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:56,382
to collect information in the cloud for offline events.

721
00:29:56,562 --> 00:29:58,403
So if their game can be played offline,

722
00:29:58,784 --> 00:30:00,205
you don't want them to have to solve that.

723
00:30:01,045 --> 00:30:04,388
It's completely okay if I have to build an IKEA chair.

724
00:30:05,108 --> 00:30:06,749
If you ask me to build a Golden Gate Bridge,

725
00:30:06,889 --> 00:30:07,970
I'm probably gonna consult someone.

726
00:30:08,951 --> 00:30:12,493
All right, you have to, that independence is not absolute.

727
00:30:13,544 --> 00:30:14,965
All right, based on a true story,

728
00:30:15,065 --> 00:30:17,427
we had a game that wanted to implement a bidding system

729
00:30:18,087 --> 00:30:19,749
for the programmatic bidding.

730
00:30:20,309 --> 00:30:22,271
We had a team in the company, it wasn't a game,

731
00:30:22,291 --> 00:30:23,412
but it was a team in marketing

732
00:30:23,452 --> 00:30:26,014
that wanted to develop our own bidding system.

733
00:30:27,035 --> 00:30:28,296
Then this is another example

734
00:30:28,336 --> 00:30:29,897
for don't develop what you can buy.

735
00:30:30,157 --> 00:30:31,999
This is not the core competency for the company.

736
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:33,019
We are game developers.

737
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:34,581
All right.

738
00:30:36,863 --> 00:30:38,404
One core pack to rule them all.

739
00:30:39,578 --> 00:30:42,581
The idea behind this is we had a problem.

740
00:30:43,301 --> 00:30:44,462
I was working at Clarion.

741
00:30:44,942 --> 00:30:46,683
The main problem we had at Clarion

742
00:30:47,004 --> 00:30:47,984
had nothing to do with this.

743
00:30:48,765 --> 00:30:50,806
Clarion was switching from Facebook to mobile.

744
00:30:51,947 --> 00:30:53,408
Switching from Facebook to mobile

745
00:30:53,448 --> 00:30:56,590
basically forced us to rewrite all the data architecture.

746
00:30:57,111 --> 00:30:59,472
We had to bring in some very clever people

747
00:30:59,532 --> 00:31:00,713
with very fancy titles,

748
00:31:00,773 --> 00:31:03,655
and we had to build a big data system.

749
00:31:04,256 --> 00:31:05,757
But we saw an opportunity.

750
00:31:06,649 --> 00:31:09,691
to organize and bring some order into how we do tracking.

751
00:31:10,191 --> 00:31:12,472
And the thing that we did at Plarium

752
00:31:12,512 --> 00:31:15,153
was we sat with the studios.

753
00:31:15,313 --> 00:31:17,494
And we had studios in the Ukraine, in the US,

754
00:31:17,534 --> 00:31:18,195
in Tel Aviv.

755
00:31:18,215 --> 00:31:20,936
We even had two studios in the Ukraine

756
00:31:20,956 --> 00:31:22,857
within hours of each other, one in Simferopol

757
00:31:22,877 --> 00:31:23,617
and one in Kharkov.

758
00:31:24,158 --> 00:31:25,358
And they weren't talking to each other.

759
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:28,460
Each of them had their own data collecting system,

760
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,961
their own database, two game-specific.

761
00:31:31,841 --> 00:31:34,623
And then the GM asked, how much money did I make today?

762
00:31:34,903 --> 00:31:35,923
And that was a bit of a problem.

763
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:39,331
All the pieces of the puzzle were basically scattered.

764
00:31:40,132 --> 00:31:42,593
So when we recreated the system at Clarion,

765
00:31:42,613 --> 00:31:46,034
what we did was we sat down with every head of studio

766
00:31:46,134 --> 00:31:48,435
and we said, okay, what happens all the time?

767
00:31:48,595 --> 00:31:50,136
What are the things that you always repeat?

768
00:31:50,936 --> 00:31:53,717
Now keep in mind, some of these games were strategies,

769
00:31:53,737 --> 00:31:55,038
some of these games were racing.

770
00:31:55,758 --> 00:31:58,719
They have very different, very distinct styles,

771
00:31:58,779 --> 00:32:00,080
but there are things that they all do.

772
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,801
So some events we found are always re-implemented.

773
00:32:04,001 --> 00:32:05,482
Like login, like purchase.

774
00:32:07,807 --> 00:32:10,048
Some of the things that we saw were

775
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:11,708
they were not using the same definitions.

776
00:32:11,948 --> 00:32:13,729
So there could be someone tracking a login

777
00:32:13,829 --> 00:32:15,469
and writing a timestamp that is local.

778
00:32:16,069 --> 00:32:18,630
And someone would be writing a timestamp that is CET.

779
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,671
And then when you need to try to understand

780
00:32:20,711 --> 00:32:22,191
who did what and how many active users,

781
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:23,652
I had a very basic question.

782
00:32:24,352 --> 00:32:25,012
You get lost.

783
00:32:26,052 --> 00:32:28,473
A problem that we had at SocialPoint with this was

784
00:32:29,433 --> 00:32:30,853
those new games that I mentioned,

785
00:32:31,394 --> 00:32:33,354
all those new games that keep launching every week

786
00:32:33,594 --> 00:32:34,895
and making a mess of my life,

787
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:38,011
A lot of them were launching without events.

788
00:32:38,212 --> 00:32:41,113
Even when they had their own personal ability to do it,

789
00:32:41,753 --> 00:32:43,374
they were missing some data from the stores

790
00:32:44,115 --> 00:32:44,955
about the purchases.

791
00:32:45,415 --> 00:32:46,796
Still, some of the configurations,

792
00:32:46,836 --> 00:32:48,237
some of the wires weren't always there.

793
00:32:48,937 --> 00:32:50,738
And there's a set of things that every game needs,

794
00:32:50,778 --> 00:32:52,519
and there's a set of configurations

795
00:32:52,819 --> 00:32:54,040
you can do for everyone.

796
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,681
So what we did was we just decided

797
00:32:57,301 --> 00:33:00,383
to create one universal component

798
00:33:00,923 --> 00:33:02,124
that every game can plug in.

799
00:33:03,424 --> 00:33:04,425
and just have all the tracking.

800
00:33:04,885 --> 00:33:07,486
Instead of each game developing their own approach

801
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:09,707
to what do I track, how do I track,

802
00:33:10,508 --> 00:33:11,768
we said, okay, here's something,

803
00:33:11,988 --> 00:33:15,170
all you need to do is call this component in your code.

804
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:16,070
It's an SDK.

805
00:33:16,991 --> 00:33:18,692
If you don't know what it is, that's perfectly okay.

806
00:33:18,892 --> 00:33:19,892
If you do, fantastic.

807
00:33:20,432 --> 00:33:23,034
We created a component in our system

808
00:33:23,714 --> 00:33:25,475
that everyone used in the same way

809
00:33:25,555 --> 00:33:27,536
and we standardized how we collect events.

810
00:33:29,337 --> 00:33:29,697
This was

811
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,081
Quite a challenge from a business perspective,

812
00:33:33,121 --> 00:33:35,263
because once you have that distributed freedom

813
00:33:35,323 --> 00:33:36,544
and everyone does what they want,

814
00:33:37,105 --> 00:33:38,306
you want them to change what they do

815
00:33:38,346 --> 00:33:39,607
just so everyone can be aligned.

816
00:33:40,108 --> 00:33:41,929
It's not always easy, but there's a lot of benefits.

817
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:45,293
One benefit was that the number of problems we had

818
00:33:45,373 --> 00:33:47,915
with games launching and things not working,

819
00:33:48,676 --> 00:33:51,338
like for example, data from Apple Store, it was gone.

820
00:33:52,311 --> 00:33:55,213
Almost every game now when they launch is just a lot simpler.

821
00:33:55,373 --> 00:33:56,655
They know they call this component,

822
00:33:56,675 --> 00:33:57,916
they know how they're supposed to call it.

823
00:33:58,496 --> 00:34:00,938
They don't need to think too much or reinvent the wheel

824
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:02,559
every time there's a new game.

825
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:03,960
Also, it saves some time.

826
00:34:05,382 --> 00:34:07,223
And my analysts have an easier time

827
00:34:07,263 --> 00:34:09,165
when they need to do an analysis on several games,

828
00:34:09,805 --> 00:34:12,227
and they can know that an event for login

829
00:34:12,287 --> 00:34:13,528
always has the user ID,

830
00:34:13,928 --> 00:34:15,470
and this is how you calculate a user ID.

831
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:18,192
It always has a date, and it has a location,

832
00:34:18,232 --> 00:34:19,693
and that location is a coordinates,

833
00:34:20,434 --> 00:34:21,394
or it's a country code.

834
00:34:21,973 --> 00:34:23,334
If you standardize those things,

835
00:34:23,374 --> 00:34:25,355
which is very simple and very common sense,

836
00:34:25,395 --> 00:34:27,796
I'm not saying anything here that is complicated,

837
00:34:28,216 --> 00:34:29,417
but if you get to that point,

838
00:34:29,497 --> 00:34:30,878
you'll make your life a lot easier.

839
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:34,220
By the way, if you are using an external tool

840
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,081
like Delta DNA, you are using an SDK.

841
00:34:37,782 --> 00:34:38,122
All right.

842
00:34:40,583 --> 00:34:42,604
Playing levels without having players.

843
00:34:43,365 --> 00:34:46,747
How do you go about getting play data

844
00:34:46,967 --> 00:34:48,628
for your game without having players?

845
00:34:49,743 --> 00:34:50,784
Again, we had a problem.

846
00:34:51,485 --> 00:34:53,928
We had a game that was a match three game, Dogs Home.

847
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:57,794
Very nice game, developed by a guy who came in for King

848
00:34:58,114 --> 00:35:01,238
and he was trying to understand what the hell was going on.

849
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:02,700
We were creating versions.

850
00:35:03,642 --> 00:35:06,844
And those versions had a specific learning curve in mind.

851
00:35:07,045 --> 00:35:09,227
We were trying to create a learning curve

852
00:35:09,247 --> 00:35:11,849
that goes along certain pathways.

853
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:13,130
This should be a harder point.

854
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:14,591
This should be a monetization trigger.

855
00:35:15,132 --> 00:35:17,514
This should be a relaxed area.

856
00:35:18,274 --> 00:35:20,496
And what happened was most of the time,

857
00:35:20,536 --> 00:35:21,277
it was just too easy.

858
00:35:22,178 --> 00:35:23,859
Just users were breezing through it.

859
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,221
We also had another game, Legends at War,

860
00:35:26,902 --> 00:35:29,725
that users just made it to level 20 without any challenge.

861
00:35:29,745 --> 00:35:31,746
Like the first time they had any problems would be level 10.

862
00:35:33,142 --> 00:35:35,483
And we would tweak it, and we would re-release the game,

863
00:35:35,544 --> 00:35:36,584
and this time it would be too hard.

864
00:35:37,304 --> 00:35:38,125
And user would churn.

865
00:35:38,605 --> 00:35:41,587
So we were trying to aim for a certain playing experience,

866
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:44,808
but to get there every time we did it,

867
00:35:44,868 --> 00:35:46,809
we released a version, we had users play it,

868
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:51,312
we lost those users, which cost us money in marketing spend,

869
00:35:51,792 --> 00:35:52,753
and we lost a lot of money.

870
00:35:53,865 --> 00:35:55,826
The idea was, can we solve this problem?

871
00:35:55,866 --> 00:35:59,728
Can we have a level played as we design it?

872
00:35:59,868 --> 00:36:01,089
While we're designing the game,

873
00:36:01,169 --> 00:36:03,391
get data for what this level will be played,

874
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:04,792
how this level will be played.

875
00:36:05,392 --> 00:36:08,394
So this is Sisyphus, by the way, with a rock.

876
00:36:10,375 --> 00:36:10,875
Very simple.

877
00:36:11,376 --> 00:36:12,456
We just got a machine to do it.

878
00:36:13,837 --> 00:36:16,379
What you're seeing here is actually a screenshot

879
00:36:16,479 --> 00:36:20,121
from the Mac of one of my guys in my team.

880
00:36:20,141 --> 00:36:21,702
This is actually a Unity environment.

881
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:22,823
That's the game.

882
00:36:24,051 --> 00:36:26,373
and you're seeing the AI that we created play the game.

883
00:36:26,433 --> 00:36:28,135
You're literally seeing the game being played

884
00:36:28,875 --> 00:36:29,776
as you're designing it.

885
00:36:30,276 --> 00:36:31,257
So the game designer,

886
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,679
and this goes back to what I said about fit.

887
00:36:33,759 --> 00:36:35,401
We were trying to solve a problem

888
00:36:36,101 --> 00:36:37,723
and we knew exactly how this would work.

889
00:36:37,803 --> 00:36:40,005
It was actionable, we knew who's gonna use it,

890
00:36:40,645 --> 00:36:41,706
we knew what the value is,

891
00:36:42,447 --> 00:36:44,368
and we knew which process we would be helping.

892
00:36:45,648 --> 00:36:47,369
We sat down with the team and we created

893
00:36:47,409 --> 00:36:49,489
for the game designer with a click of a button,

894
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:51,330
he can test any level that he had.

895
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:53,771
He'd have a certain seed for the level

896
00:36:54,091 --> 00:36:55,712
and he would play it and he will get the results.

897
00:36:56,232 --> 00:37:00,134
If we played 100 times, about take 10 seconds.

898
00:37:01,574 --> 00:37:02,875
By the way, the version we just saw,

899
00:37:02,915 --> 00:37:04,716
this version with the graphics takes about three hours

900
00:37:05,216 --> 00:37:06,096
because of all the graphics.

901
00:37:06,136 --> 00:37:08,457
We have a headless version where you don't see anything

902
00:37:08,497 --> 00:37:10,378
and you just get the results, that take 10 seconds.

903
00:37:10,998 --> 00:37:12,659
So the idea was,

904
00:37:14,163 --> 00:37:17,245
Create an AI, which may sound like a super complex

905
00:37:17,305 --> 00:37:19,646
NASA project, but it took us a few weeks with one person.

906
00:37:20,367 --> 00:37:21,967
None of the things that I'm using today

907
00:37:22,067 --> 00:37:25,029
is something that is insurmountable for a small team.

908
00:37:25,369 --> 00:37:28,491
You do need a data scientist, but you need one and a Mac.

909
00:37:29,171 --> 00:37:31,092
None of this was done with Pentagon Computing.

910
00:37:32,933 --> 00:37:33,853
We created an AI.

911
00:37:33,994 --> 00:37:35,394
This AI that we're talking about here

912
00:37:35,434 --> 00:37:36,835
was specifically for match threes.

913
00:37:36,915 --> 00:37:39,596
We had AIs for other types of games in the company,

914
00:37:39,756 --> 00:37:40,597
RPGs, for example.

915
00:37:41,395 --> 00:37:43,437
It does 100 plays in a matter of seconds,

916
00:37:43,677 --> 00:37:45,499
and we're improving that even more.

917
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:47,600
So the game designer would have a level.

918
00:37:48,081 --> 00:37:51,143
He would say, okay, play this as if you're really good.

919
00:37:51,483 --> 00:37:52,924
We call that explosive mode.

920
00:37:53,445 --> 00:37:54,766
Explosive mode is the mode that goes

921
00:37:54,786 --> 00:37:55,947
for the maximum explosions.

922
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:57,808
Always looks for four of a kind

923
00:37:57,868 --> 00:38:00,110
or something that really is gonna bright up the screen.

924
00:38:02,452 --> 00:38:04,834
And we can also say play this as a normal user.

925
00:38:05,414 --> 00:38:07,256
So you can simulate user playing it,

926
00:38:07,496 --> 00:38:08,977
and you can get a lot of information for that.

927
00:38:10,953 --> 00:38:13,493
One thing to keep in mind, this AI that we created

928
00:38:13,533 --> 00:38:14,454
doesn't tell you what's fun.

929
00:38:15,114 --> 00:38:16,634
It also doesn't predict retention,

930
00:38:16,674 --> 00:38:18,834
it doesn't tell you if the users will buy,

931
00:38:19,215 --> 00:38:20,635
what they will buy, yet.

932
00:38:21,475 --> 00:38:23,475
We're only simulating the playing.

933
00:38:24,436 --> 00:38:27,576
But that was very beneficial for what we were trying to do.

934
00:38:28,416 --> 00:38:32,797
All right, and it can be done by very many teams.

935
00:38:33,197 --> 00:38:35,898
You do need a scientist, it is a prerequisite for this, but.

936
00:38:37,578 --> 00:38:37,758
Okay.

937
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,602
Testing for small audiences.

938
00:38:41,603 --> 00:38:43,325
My last example that I want to share with you

939
00:38:43,545 --> 00:38:46,628
is something that for us was a main point of pain.

940
00:38:46,989 --> 00:38:48,671
This was something that was driving us crazy

941
00:38:48,791 --> 00:38:51,694
because the analytics people, we want to test everything.

942
00:38:52,375 --> 00:38:54,337
And when you ask me, did a version work?

943
00:38:55,058 --> 00:38:57,020
I don't want to say yes or no.

944
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,242
I want to say, well.

945
00:38:58,942 --> 00:38:59,823
The theme worked.

946
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:02,426
That feature generated a lot of conversion,

947
00:39:02,486 --> 00:39:03,648
but at the cost of churn.

948
00:39:04,269 --> 00:39:05,950
And that feature was completely useless.

949
00:39:05,971 --> 00:39:06,791
No one tried it.

950
00:39:07,172 --> 00:39:09,595
That's what I want to say when you ask me about a version.

951
00:39:10,075 --> 00:39:11,677
But to do that, I need to collect

952
00:39:12,438 --> 00:39:13,900
very detailed information.

953
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:16,883
I need to do a lot of focus on learning.

954
00:39:17,023 --> 00:39:18,325
I want to learn as much as I can.

955
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:22,592
The problem is, if that makes the game run very, very slow,

956
00:39:23,092 --> 00:39:24,153
and everything that they do,

957
00:39:24,273 --> 00:39:25,813
I want to have a statistical test,

958
00:39:26,414 --> 00:39:28,795
and I want to analyze it, I want it to be significant,

959
00:39:28,835 --> 00:39:31,676
so I need a lot of users in my samples,

960
00:39:32,276 --> 00:39:33,857
that becomes a big problem for the business.

961
00:39:34,517 --> 00:39:35,918
That was something that we had to solve.

962
00:39:36,138 --> 00:39:39,860
Now this also was exacerbated

963
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,361
by the fact we had so many new games.

964
00:39:42,127 --> 00:39:43,768
But I can tell you honestly, between us,

965
00:39:44,308 --> 00:39:46,149
we have this problem with the big games too,

966
00:39:46,549 --> 00:39:48,190
where I had millions of DAOs,

967
00:39:48,731 --> 00:39:49,891
even there I had this problem.

968
00:39:50,372 --> 00:39:52,093
Even there would take me sometimes a month

969
00:39:52,953 --> 00:39:54,114
to give results on a feature.

970
00:39:54,194 --> 00:39:58,377
That feature is for level 27 people of specific country

971
00:39:58,417 --> 00:40:01,599
who played a specific thing on an alliance,

972
00:40:01,819 --> 00:40:02,860
on a specific live ops.

973
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,241
That will also take a very long time.

974
00:40:05,942 --> 00:40:08,643
So, we wanted to have A-B testing run more quickly.

975
00:40:09,524 --> 00:40:10,464
We had a lot of new games.

976
00:40:11,641 --> 00:40:12,582
Time was very critical.

977
00:40:13,662 --> 00:40:15,524
And we wanted to stop slowing them down.

978
00:40:15,884 --> 00:40:18,806
Now, Social Point is so smart about data

979
00:40:18,846 --> 00:40:20,087
that when we had these discussions,

980
00:40:20,587 --> 00:40:21,628
they would still do this.

981
00:40:22,588 --> 00:40:23,849
Some companies that I worked at,

982
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:25,671
if A-B testing is slowing you down,

983
00:40:25,711 --> 00:40:27,252
you would just not be doing A-B testing.

984
00:40:27,672 --> 00:40:28,372
You just drop that.

985
00:40:28,473 --> 00:40:29,333
You do something else.

986
00:40:30,354 --> 00:40:31,294
But we did.

987
00:40:33,312 --> 00:40:36,094
And what we did was we changed how we A-B test.

988
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:40,117
Now, I'm going to explain this in a very simple way,

989
00:40:40,197 --> 00:40:41,838
and this is something that everyone can do.

990
00:40:42,399 --> 00:40:45,261
I will mention a bit the math behind what we did.

991
00:40:46,062 --> 00:40:48,564
But in one sentence, what we did was

992
00:40:49,424 --> 00:40:50,465
we just applied what we know.

993
00:40:51,626 --> 00:40:54,188
When we did testing, instead of coming to A-B test,

994
00:40:55,094 --> 00:40:57,756
completely naive and say, okay, let's see,

995
00:40:57,976 --> 00:41:01,798
what is the likelihood of someone buying this dragon,

996
00:41:02,499 --> 00:41:05,281
of someone playing this new type of battle?

997
00:41:05,981 --> 00:41:08,022
What we did was we took what we know about users.

998
00:41:08,643 --> 00:41:10,124
We had a conversion percent that we know.

999
00:41:10,164 --> 00:41:13,886
We said, okay, given that we know users tend to convert,

1000
00:41:13,926 --> 00:41:15,327
for example, on the first session,

1001
00:41:16,508 --> 00:41:19,790
and users tend to buy the first dragon by level seven.

1002
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:21,111
Given that,

1003
00:41:22,317 --> 00:41:22,997
What can we do?

1004
00:41:23,577 --> 00:41:26,239
And this is in statistical terms, this is a switch,

1005
00:41:26,439 --> 00:41:28,020
I apologize in advance for the Chinese.

1006
00:41:28,841 --> 00:41:30,862
It's a switch from a frequentist approach

1007
00:41:31,463 --> 00:41:32,403
to a Bayesian approach.

1008
00:41:32,763 --> 00:41:34,625
It just means given what I know,

1009
00:41:35,265 --> 00:41:36,786
what is the likelihood of something happening?

1010
00:41:37,567 --> 00:41:39,008
In business terms, what it meant was

1011
00:41:39,068 --> 00:41:42,770
we took something that took a month and a million users

1012
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:45,132
and we made it take 1,000 users in a week.

1013
00:41:46,853 --> 00:41:48,754
It also means we took a lot of assumptions.

1014
00:41:49,893 --> 00:41:51,994
It means that when I have a new game and I say,

1015
00:41:52,054 --> 00:41:54,515
well, I know my conversion is usually mm

1016
00:41:55,175 --> 00:41:56,936
and happens on the first session,

1017
00:41:57,816 --> 00:41:59,457
I assume that game is like my other game,

1018
00:42:00,137 --> 00:42:01,338
which may or may not be the case.

1019
00:42:02,278 --> 00:42:05,459
So when you do these things, please consult an expert.

1020
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:08,220
Okay, please make sure that you work with someone

1021
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,821
who can verify or validate if this applies.

1022
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:13,482
But if you can take your learnings and take what you know,

1023
00:42:14,363 --> 00:42:16,364
you can do A-B testing much more quickly

1024
00:42:16,404 --> 00:42:19,105
with a lot less users, significantly less.

1025
00:42:20,707 --> 00:42:21,808
So we use what we know.

1026
00:42:22,549 --> 00:42:24,431
Another thing that I really recommend that you do

1027
00:42:24,891 --> 00:42:27,394
is run what's called an AA test.

1028
00:42:27,874 --> 00:42:29,876
Take the same version, don't change anything,

1029
00:42:30,557 --> 00:42:34,361
randomly sample two groups, 50% go here, 50% go here,

1030
00:42:35,001 --> 00:42:36,062
and check what is the difference.

1031
00:42:36,743 --> 00:42:37,844
You will be surprised.

1032
00:42:38,284 --> 00:42:40,206
We found 5 to 10% difference

1033
00:42:40,226 --> 00:42:41,648
with nothing different between them,

1034
00:42:42,388 --> 00:42:43,990
just because of volatility in the market.

1035
00:42:44,849 --> 00:42:46,770
just because some whale came into one group

1036
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:47,751
and made some crazy noise.

1037
00:42:48,271 --> 00:42:51,153
So one thing you wanna know about your games

1038
00:42:51,273 --> 00:42:52,654
if you are going to be testing is

1039
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:55,856
what's the natural occurring variance that you can expect.

1040
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:57,557
And if you know, by the way,

1041
00:42:57,617 --> 00:42:59,859
that five to 10% occurs naturally,

1042
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,140
this is what you would do differently.

1043
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,522
You would try something, you would put something in a store.

1044
00:43:05,382 --> 00:43:06,683
You'd put a new offer in the store,

1045
00:43:06,703 --> 00:43:08,745
and you would say, okay, this offer,

1046
00:43:08,925 --> 00:43:10,586
I only showed it to some users,

1047
00:43:10,646 --> 00:43:11,927
but the ones that I showed it to

1048
00:43:12,867 --> 00:43:14,468
are 5% more likely to buy it.

1049
00:43:15,625 --> 00:43:18,705
If you know you already have a 5% or 10% variance,

1050
00:43:18,885 --> 00:43:19,686
that means nothing.

1051
00:43:20,526 --> 00:43:22,466
Because then what will happen, and this happened to us

1052
00:43:22,526 --> 00:43:25,727
in social point, we released it and nothing happened.

1053
00:43:27,007 --> 00:43:29,108
And the test said 5%, so what the hell?

1054
00:43:30,488 --> 00:43:32,649
So be careful with what you assume.

1055
00:43:32,669 --> 00:43:35,149
The idea of an A-B test is, again,

1056
00:43:35,209 --> 00:43:39,030
to try to explain what will work and how much effect you can

1057
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:40,470
work, how much effect you can expect.

1058
00:43:41,011 --> 00:43:43,551
By the way, one of the biggest debates

1059
00:43:43,591 --> 00:43:45,232
we have right now in social point is.

1060
00:43:46,314 --> 00:43:48,695
What good is an A-B test that shows you

1061
00:43:48,735 --> 00:43:49,696
something would not work?

1062
00:43:50,857 --> 00:43:52,197
We have a big argument about this.

1063
00:43:52,337 --> 00:43:54,038
I have a lot of tests that I'm doing,

1064
00:43:54,759 --> 00:43:55,559
and what I'm seeing is,

1065
00:43:55,819 --> 00:43:57,240
forget the ones that I'm seeing damage,

1066
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,721
that I'm seeing it's gonna destroy a user base,

1067
00:43:59,761 --> 00:44:00,302
that's easy.

1068
00:44:00,642 --> 00:44:01,582
I do a defensive test,

1069
00:44:01,662 --> 00:44:04,204
I see that it's gonna be badly received

1070
00:44:04,264 --> 00:44:06,205
by the community, easy.

1071
00:44:06,805 --> 00:44:07,545
The other thing is,

1072
00:44:07,806 --> 00:44:10,447
I have some tests where someone has a great idea,

1073
00:44:11,027 --> 00:44:13,028
they change something, we test it,

1074
00:44:13,208 --> 00:44:14,309
and we see that there's no impact.

1075
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:18,491
If you ask me, I will tell you, I think that's very useful.

1076
00:44:19,291 --> 00:44:20,652
Because you can avoid releasing that,

1077
00:44:20,812 --> 00:44:22,253
if you know there's not gonna be an impact.

1078
00:44:22,773 --> 00:44:25,575
And most of the time, they listen to us and they don't.

1079
00:44:25,975 --> 00:44:28,416
Sometimes, game designers still release it,

1080
00:44:28,776 --> 00:44:29,296
and guess what?

1081
00:44:30,077 --> 00:44:30,537
No impact.

1082
00:44:31,458 --> 00:44:33,018
Just more noise in the versions.

1083
00:44:33,579 --> 00:44:34,359
Just more distractions.

1084
00:44:35,079 --> 00:44:37,361
It's not always a bad thing, but innovation is also good.

1085
00:44:37,861 --> 00:44:43,003
Okay, so AA, and be very careful about what you see.

1086
00:44:43,244 --> 00:44:44,064
Consider the variance.

1087
00:44:45,461 --> 00:44:47,402
Another thing you can do, and this is just

1088
00:44:47,482 --> 00:44:49,664
a basic business side of testing,

1089
00:44:49,864 --> 00:44:52,505
try to use things that are zero or one.

1090
00:44:53,306 --> 00:44:54,727
You can have a test and say, okay,

1091
00:44:54,847 --> 00:44:57,228
what will be the impact on user spend?

1092
00:44:58,049 --> 00:44:59,170
And then you have anywhere between,

1093
00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:03,993
they will spend a dollar more a day, $2, $2.5, $10 more.

1094
00:45:04,373 --> 00:45:06,234
That's a continuous spectrum.

1095
00:45:06,854 --> 00:45:09,776
Statistically, that makes it harder to classify a group.

1096
00:45:10,157 --> 00:45:12,698
If you say, what is the likelihood that someone would buy?

1097
00:45:13,639 --> 00:45:15,281
Just conversion, one or zero,

1098
00:45:15,861 --> 00:45:17,703
it's a lot easier to design a test for that

1099
00:45:17,903 --> 00:45:18,624
with less users.

1100
00:45:20,085 --> 00:45:23,007
Retention, will they stay in the game the next day or not?

1101
00:45:23,768 --> 00:45:25,229
That's something that's a lot easier to do

1102
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:26,571
with smaller user bases.

1103
00:45:27,131 --> 00:45:30,074
So I strongly recommend binary variables.

1104
00:45:32,135 --> 00:45:34,658
What we achieved with this was, like I said,

1105
00:45:34,958 --> 00:45:37,480
we just cut down by magnitudes

1106
00:45:38,021 --> 00:45:40,843
how many users we need and how much time we take.

1107
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:43,622
Now, one thing I'm gonna leave you with,

1108
00:45:44,903 --> 00:45:46,965
this is an amazing success, we were very happy.

1109
00:45:47,525 --> 00:45:50,187
It made the new games able to use A-B testing

1110
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:50,928
as part of their work.

1111
00:45:51,969 --> 00:45:53,650
Do we do A-B testing in all the new games?

1112
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:54,491
Nope.

1113
00:45:55,812 --> 00:45:57,673
This is actually an argument that I had and I lost,

1114
00:45:57,733 --> 00:45:59,254
and I think it was good that I lost it.

1115
00:46:00,696 --> 00:46:01,937
Sometimes what you wanna do

1116
00:46:01,997 --> 00:46:03,378
is you just wanna measure a big impact.

1117
00:46:03,498 --> 00:46:04,819
Like I said, we have a new game,

1118
00:46:04,859 --> 00:46:05,900
that new game is aiming for 3X.

1119
00:46:07,443 --> 00:46:11,124
If that new version doesn't achieve 3x on its retention,

1120
00:46:11,464 --> 00:46:12,084
it doesn't matter.

1121
00:46:13,125 --> 00:46:15,466
It just doesn't matter which parts of the version worked

1122
00:46:15,546 --> 00:46:16,646
or what of it worked or not.

1123
00:46:17,306 --> 00:46:19,287
You can just throw the kitchen sink at it.

1124
00:46:20,107 --> 00:46:20,607
Did it work?

1125
00:46:21,047 --> 00:46:21,247
No?

1126
00:46:21,388 --> 00:46:22,348
Okay, try something else,

1127
00:46:22,408 --> 00:46:24,048
but try something drastically different.

1128
00:46:24,629 --> 00:46:25,749
Don't just change, tweak.

1129
00:46:26,589 --> 00:46:27,930
For optimization, for tweaks,

1130
00:46:28,090 --> 00:46:30,050
A-B testing, I think, are a must.

1131
00:46:30,611 --> 00:46:32,651
But when you try to make huge changes

1132
00:46:32,771 --> 00:46:35,772
or measure things, very quickly,

1133
00:46:36,332 --> 00:46:37,053
like in a new game.

1134
00:46:38,085 --> 00:46:40,367
Maybe more data is not the right answer.

1135
00:46:41,968 --> 00:46:45,250
All right, so what did we talk about?

1136
00:46:46,611 --> 00:46:48,293
We talked about the dark side of analytics.

1137
00:46:48,573 --> 00:46:51,295
I told you a bit about some of the problems we had

1138
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:54,217
or some of the things we did

1139
00:46:54,358 --> 00:46:55,458
that we could have done differently

1140
00:46:55,559 --> 00:46:56,579
or we're doing differently now.

1141
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:58,801
Specifically, just keep focused.

1142
00:46:59,462 --> 00:47:01,503
Be very disciplined in how you apply data.

1143
00:47:02,344 --> 00:47:04,005
When you apply data, make sure that there's

1144
00:47:05,368 --> 00:47:07,290
an answer that someone is waiting for.

1145
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:08,770
Make sure that you're solving something

1146
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:11,832
or you're gonna change a process in how the games are made.

1147
00:47:12,472 --> 00:47:14,994
Otherwise, maybe this is not the most important thing to do.

1148
00:47:16,515 --> 00:47:18,476
We talked about tracking user actions

1149
00:47:18,776 --> 00:47:23,058
and the benefits of letting the games do it on their own.

1150
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:25,360
Do it yourself tracking.

1151
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:26,620
If you empower the games,

1152
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,341
if you let the product teams run

1153
00:47:28,361 --> 00:47:30,122
at the pace that they wanna run,

1154
00:47:30,142 --> 00:47:32,444
you can change a lot of things.

1155
00:47:32,664 --> 00:47:33,784
You can remove a lot of bottlenecks.

1156
00:47:34,903 --> 00:47:37,664
Okay, playing levels with our players.

1157
00:47:37,844 --> 00:47:40,746
I showed you what we did to solve a very big design question

1158
00:47:40,766 --> 00:47:45,128
that we had and some tips about how you can take A-B testing

1159
00:47:45,208 --> 00:47:47,349
and still apply it to small studios,

1160
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:49,591
small audiences, small features.

1161
00:47:51,672 --> 00:47:52,672
All right, thank you.

1162
00:47:59,736 --> 00:48:00,176
Questions?

1163
00:48:01,137 --> 00:48:01,897
Yeah, all right.

1164
00:48:01,977 --> 00:48:02,918
Thanks for the talk, that was great.

1165
00:48:03,929 --> 00:48:07,952
I understand the concept of you automatically throwing something into

1166
00:48:07,972 --> 00:48:10,973
your data lake once you implement it in one of your games, et cetera.

1167
00:48:11,373 --> 00:48:13,034
But somebody has to consume that eventually.

1168
00:48:13,054 --> 00:48:16,916
Somebody has to create a report that's going to show that to them, right?

1169
00:48:17,077 --> 00:48:21,919
How do you diminish the bottleneck between you showing a new feature to

1170
00:48:21,979 --> 00:48:26,902
somebody when you have already probably some humongous backlog of more important

1171
00:48:26,922 --> 00:48:27,162
things?

1172
00:48:28,009 --> 00:48:30,852
So the question is, I just, so for everyone to hear,

1173
00:48:31,713 --> 00:48:34,716
I have this data, like I have this personal game-specific

1174
00:48:34,736 --> 00:48:36,918
database that they can dump things into and analyze,

1175
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:39,101
but someone needs to visualize that data,

1176
00:48:39,141 --> 00:48:40,722
or someone needs to do an analysis about it.

1177
00:48:41,605 --> 00:48:45,228
And that usually happens as a prioritization in the game.

1178
00:48:45,288 --> 00:48:47,009
So we have an analyst for the game,

1179
00:48:47,089 --> 00:48:51,091
or they have a set amount of resources from my pool

1180
00:48:51,591 --> 00:48:53,372
that they can use, and we work with them.

1181
00:48:53,853 --> 00:48:56,534
We usually do that with a self-service tool as well.

1182
00:48:56,714 --> 00:48:58,616
So the analyst doesn't work with engineering

1183
00:48:58,656 --> 00:48:59,936
in the main dashboards that I do.

1184
00:49:00,457 --> 00:49:01,918
They use something like Tableau or Charter.

1185
00:49:03,055 --> 00:49:07,056
But then again, I have 10 versions of the same dashboard

1186
00:49:07,096 --> 00:49:09,577
right now hanging around that I need to wrangle.

1187
00:49:10,838 --> 00:49:12,559
But you have to do the same for the visualization.

1188
00:49:12,619 --> 00:49:13,419
Otherwise, it doesn't work.

1189
00:49:13,439 --> 00:49:13,779
That's right.

1190
00:49:13,799 --> 00:49:14,759
Thanks.

1191
00:49:18,094 --> 00:49:19,015
All right. Yes.

1192
00:49:19,135 --> 00:49:23,962
Hello. In our studio, we have a really passionate player base that are quite closely knit, and

1193
00:49:24,062 --> 00:49:27,607
we were against doing A-B testing for a while because we're concerned that players are going

1194
00:49:27,627 --> 00:49:31,813
to compare the data and they have in the past with some things. So do you have any tips

1195
00:49:31,873 --> 00:49:34,937
against that or for us how to work with that issue?

1196
00:49:35,843 --> 00:49:39,625
Yeah, so the question is about A-B testing

1197
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:41,486
not as a statistical experiment,

1198
00:49:41,526 --> 00:49:42,847
but you're affecting the community,

1199
00:49:43,227 --> 00:49:44,908
and some of the community is exposed to things.

1200
00:49:45,048 --> 00:49:45,728
Did I get it right?

1201
00:49:46,048 --> 00:49:47,829
Yeah, so before I came to the studio,

1202
00:49:47,869 --> 00:49:50,171
when I suggested if we could do A-B testing,

1203
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:52,452
I was recommended it might not be worth doing

1204
00:49:52,552 --> 00:49:54,753
because the players will compare the data and go,

1205
00:49:54,873 --> 00:49:56,334
oh, why does this person have something

1206
00:49:56,374 --> 00:49:57,495
that I don't in my game?

1207
00:49:58,155 --> 00:50:00,096
So you have to be very careful about how we do it.

1208
00:50:01,490 --> 00:50:02,351
We're very limited.

1209
00:50:02,671 --> 00:50:05,154
Some of the tests I want to do in my long-running games,

1210
00:50:05,274 --> 00:50:07,877
there's an implicit contract with the players.

1211
00:50:07,937 --> 00:50:10,860
There's things like price sensitivity or economy

1212
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,242
that are really hard for me to change.

1213
00:50:13,923 --> 00:50:15,565
It's a lot easier for me to do in a new game.

1214
00:50:16,085 --> 00:50:19,149
But one of the things we do when we do roll out something,

1215
00:50:19,369 --> 00:50:20,630
and we know some users will see it,

1216
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:21,972
especially when you do it with whales

1217
00:50:22,052 --> 00:50:23,553
or heavily paying users,

1218
00:50:24,334 --> 00:50:26,096
We usually communicate with them before.

1219
00:50:26,176 --> 00:50:29,160
We have our community managers involve them in the process.

1220
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:30,961
And we say, we're going to choose,

1221
00:50:30,982 --> 00:50:33,104
we're going to test a new type of warchief

1222
00:50:33,244 --> 00:50:35,466
or a new type of legendary item.

1223
00:50:36,227 --> 00:50:37,108
And they know it's coming.

1224
00:50:37,128 --> 00:50:38,430
They're usually quite excited to it.

1225
00:50:38,490 --> 00:50:39,711
And they're like, who's going to get it?

1226
00:50:41,073 --> 00:50:42,314
But you really have to manage that.

1227
00:50:42,534 --> 00:50:44,637
If you don't manage the expectations, it can become.

1228
00:50:45,702 --> 00:50:46,724
It's quite easy with new games.

1229
00:50:47,084 --> 00:50:48,847
New games where the community is changing,

1230
00:50:48,867 --> 00:50:50,569
you can pretty much change anything,

1231
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:52,232
and most of the cohorts,

1232
00:50:52,612 --> 00:50:55,176
there's still not a community established yet.

1233
00:50:56,037 --> 00:50:57,900
But it's true, it limits what A-B tests we do.

1234
00:50:58,521 --> 00:50:58,721
Thank you.

1235
00:51:00,077 --> 00:51:00,417
All right.

1236
00:51:00,817 --> 00:51:01,898
Hi.

1237
00:51:02,178 --> 00:51:04,559
First, very, very good, very good presentation.

1238
00:51:05,059 --> 00:51:05,680
Pretty insightful.

1239
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:07,241
I've got a question about A-B testing.

1240
00:51:07,261 --> 00:51:10,242
When you A-B testing and you've got many things to A-B test,

1241
00:51:10,302 --> 00:51:11,703
do you A-B test them separately

1242
00:51:11,863 --> 00:51:14,124
or do A-B test multiple changes at the same time?

1243
00:51:14,484 --> 00:51:17,166
And if so, how do you manage the, you know?

1244
00:51:18,467 --> 00:51:20,007
So if I understand correctly,

1245
00:51:20,048 --> 00:51:22,689
the question is do we do A-B test and A-B test

1246
00:51:22,749 --> 00:51:23,910
or A-B-C-D test?

1247
00:51:24,886 --> 00:51:26,727
Yeah, or if you have multiple.

1248
00:51:27,067 --> 00:51:28,849
Ah, multiple A-B tests happening at the same time.

1249
00:51:28,969 --> 00:51:29,369
Exactly.

1250
00:51:29,529 --> 00:51:29,749
Yeah.

1251
00:51:29,849 --> 00:51:32,171
Because they interact with each other

1252
00:51:32,211 --> 00:51:32,911
and how do you manage this?

1253
00:51:32,931 --> 00:51:35,713
Yeah, well we have invested a lot

1254
00:51:36,353 --> 00:51:38,154
into having a system that samples

1255
00:51:38,214 --> 00:51:40,336
and really isolates users.

1256
00:51:40,916 --> 00:51:42,357
And we always have a group of users

1257
00:51:42,377 --> 00:51:44,438
that is very big that we don't touch.

1258
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:46,099
For a few versions even,

1259
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:47,600
that group would not even see new versions

1260
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:49,221
that we rolled out and we're not testing.

1261
00:51:49,862 --> 00:51:50,242
Because you,

1262
00:51:52,183 --> 00:51:54,825
In small user bases, we just run multiple A, B tests,

1263
00:51:54,865 --> 00:51:57,286
and we just make sure that users are not into groups.

1264
00:51:57,907 --> 00:51:59,248
But when you have a long running game,

1265
00:51:59,388 --> 00:52:01,549
and you're testing something for advanced level,

1266
00:52:02,109 --> 00:52:04,311
like level 10, and you're testing something for new users,

1267
00:52:04,971 --> 00:52:07,552
some of the new users might end up level 10,

1268
00:52:08,113 --> 00:52:08,553
and we make...

1269
00:52:09,722 --> 00:52:12,442
very strong efforts to make sure that technically

1270
00:52:12,482 --> 00:52:13,062
that doesn't happen.

1271
00:52:13,402 --> 00:52:14,143
It almost never does.

1272
00:52:15,803 --> 00:52:16,483
Sorry, one more.

1273
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:22,084
But do you allow one user to be involved in two A-B tests?

1274
00:52:22,424 --> 00:52:23,245
No, usually we don't.

1275
00:52:23,785 --> 00:52:24,365
Usually we don't.

1276
00:52:24,445 --> 00:52:26,085
The fact that we have tests now that conclude

1277
00:52:26,125 --> 00:52:28,606
within a week or two usually, that's a lot easier.

1278
00:52:29,086 --> 00:52:30,626
Because they can just block them for a while.

1279
00:52:31,086 --> 00:52:31,666
Okay, cool, thanks.

1280
00:52:34,462 --> 00:52:34,702
Yes.

1281
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:37,182
I was confused at one point where you said

1282
00:52:37,763 --> 00:52:39,943
the answer was not to save everything.

1283
00:52:40,243 --> 00:52:40,463
Yes.

1284
00:52:40,843 --> 00:52:43,464
And then you said the answer was to save everything.

1285
00:52:43,864 --> 00:52:45,685
The question there was your bottleneck.

1286
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:47,725
So you sort of said two different,

1287
00:52:47,745 --> 00:52:48,566
it sounded like two different.

1288
00:52:48,926 --> 00:52:49,386
It depends.

1289
00:52:49,606 --> 00:52:50,886
When I say don't save everything,

1290
00:52:50,966 --> 00:52:52,607
I think when you're approaching a situation

1291
00:52:52,647 --> 00:52:54,107
where you're deciding to implement tracking.

1292
00:52:55,039 --> 00:52:56,940
be very sure that you know why you're tracking this.

1293
00:52:57,620 --> 00:53:00,142
I've seen too many cases where someone takes a database,

1294
00:53:00,182 --> 00:53:01,423
just fills it up with data,

1295
00:53:01,603 --> 00:53:03,625
what is called a data swamp instead of a data lake,

1296
00:53:04,286 --> 00:53:07,528
and they just, it sits there, no one uses it

1297
00:53:07,568 --> 00:53:09,750
because someone once asked the question,

1298
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:12,872
so they implemented it, and now when they come to use it

1299
00:53:13,072 --> 00:53:14,673
a year later, it's unusable.

1300
00:53:14,994 --> 00:53:17,255
It's missing user IDs, the dates are not there.

1301
00:53:17,756 --> 00:53:19,957
So when I say don't save everything,

1302
00:53:20,198 --> 00:53:21,078
I'm trying to refer to

1303
00:53:22,322 --> 00:53:24,204
When you approach a question and you're not sure,

1304
00:53:24,724 --> 00:53:25,885
try to refine the question.

1305
00:53:26,766 --> 00:53:28,588
Don't just say, yeah, you know what, I'll take that,

1306
00:53:28,768 --> 00:53:31,911
and that, and that, because every one of those fields

1307
00:53:31,951 --> 00:53:33,472
is gonna be a pain in the ass

1308
00:53:33,512 --> 00:53:34,913
when you have to do data quality later.

1309
00:53:35,954 --> 00:53:39,057
If you start adding country codes

1310
00:53:39,117 --> 00:53:40,659
to something that is global,

1311
00:53:41,639 --> 00:53:43,021
you'll need to do the country codes.

1312
00:53:43,301 --> 00:53:44,422
And when you work with marketing

1313
00:53:44,462 --> 00:53:46,203
and they have specific regions for campaigns,

1314
00:53:46,243 --> 00:53:47,405
that becomes a bit of a hassle.

1315
00:53:47,445 --> 00:53:48,325
So be...

1316
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,861
specific and surgical about what you're tracking.

1317
00:53:51,901 --> 00:53:53,802
That's what I mean when I say don't track everything.

1318
00:53:54,802 --> 00:53:56,982
The other thing is let the game track whatever they need.

1319
00:53:58,023 --> 00:53:59,503
So if a game needs something

1320
00:53:59,563 --> 00:54:00,723
or they think they need something,

1321
00:54:00,763 --> 00:54:02,404
I usually don't get involved in that decision.

1322
00:54:03,324 --> 00:54:04,084
I just let them run.

1323
00:54:04,184 --> 00:54:06,225
And sometimes it makes sense, sometimes not so much.

1324
00:54:07,165 --> 00:54:08,886
But they know not to come to me when there's a problem.

1325
00:54:09,586 --> 00:54:09,766
Right?

1326
00:54:10,186 --> 00:54:10,666
That make sense?

1327
00:54:10,686 --> 00:54:11,466
That answer your question?

1328
00:54:11,586 --> 00:54:11,826
All right.

1329
00:54:13,327 --> 00:54:14,647
First of all, thank you for the great talk.

1330
00:54:15,897 --> 00:54:21,202
I felt the same pain and same ideas because we provide more than 20 PCs and mobile games

1331
00:54:21,222 --> 00:54:23,244
at the same time and I'm doing the analytics there.

1332
00:54:24,745 --> 00:54:26,326
I basically have two questions.

1333
00:54:27,027 --> 00:54:31,491
First one is, in the decision-making process, the first one was, is it actionable?

1334
00:54:31,511 --> 00:54:32,192
And I was wondering,

1335
00:54:33,233 --> 00:54:35,995
if you take the time into account, for example,

1336
00:54:36,015 --> 00:54:39,318
is it actionable in a week or a month?

1337
00:54:40,159 --> 00:54:43,581
So if something that takes more than three months,

1338
00:54:43,902 --> 00:54:46,043
but that benefit can be really high,

1339
00:54:46,264 --> 00:54:48,886
but also there must be some kind of probability

1340
00:54:48,946 --> 00:54:50,887
of making a success could be a little bit low.

1341
00:54:51,268 --> 00:54:55,611
So I just wonder how you take those aspects into account

1342
00:54:55,671 --> 00:54:56,592
when you're making a decision.

1343
00:54:57,153 --> 00:54:57,833
So the question is,

1344
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:00,441
How do I know if something is actionable

1345
00:55:00,661 --> 00:55:02,182
when I decide whether to work on it or not?

1346
00:55:02,642 --> 00:55:04,263
It's a bit of a philosophical question

1347
00:55:04,303 --> 00:55:06,424
because you can define a lot of things,

1348
00:55:06,484 --> 00:55:09,306
but usually my goal in having that

1349
00:55:09,846 --> 00:55:12,308
is avoiding things that I don't have a sponsor.

1350
00:55:12,988 --> 00:55:15,009
My simple, my litmus test is,

1351
00:55:15,409 --> 00:55:16,950
if there is no sponsor from the business,

1352
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:19,472
there's no game designer behind this,

1353
00:55:19,552 --> 00:55:22,453
there's no VP involved, why am I doing this?

1354
00:55:22,833 --> 00:55:24,314
Like, is it an architecture thing

1355
00:55:24,334 --> 00:55:25,855
that I'm doing because I know we need to?

1356
00:55:26,944 --> 00:55:28,286
and I just do it, then it's okay.

1357
00:55:28,306 --> 00:55:30,268
But otherwise, if I'm trying to answer a question

1358
00:55:30,288 --> 00:55:32,491
for the business, why isn't business in this meeting?

1359
00:55:33,212 --> 00:55:34,013
When I go into a meeting

1360
00:55:34,053 --> 00:55:35,294
and there's no one from product there,

1361
00:55:35,314 --> 00:55:37,697
that's what I mean by actionable.

1362
00:55:37,937 --> 00:55:39,760
I usually try to make sure there's a sponsor

1363
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:42,283
I know will use at least one game will use this.

1364
00:55:44,222 --> 00:55:47,162
My second question is about the lean startup approach.

1365
00:55:48,102 --> 00:55:52,483
We have games that have dozens of programmers

1366
00:55:52,543 --> 00:55:54,843
and dozens of artists and loads of people involved.

1367
00:55:55,584 --> 00:55:59,964
And I really like the idea of fast, iterative approach,

1368
00:56:00,044 --> 00:56:03,425
but sometimes you analytics guys would have to wait

1369
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:05,225
until the game is hitting the market

1370
00:56:05,265 --> 00:56:06,946
with massive marketing budget.

1371
00:56:07,066 --> 00:56:10,086
So usually I see a lot of people in the first week,

1372
00:56:10,546 --> 00:56:11,946
but then it would diminish.

1373
00:56:12,687 --> 00:56:19,134
So once it is released, then there are not many things I can do in terms of like analyzing sometimes.

1374
00:56:19,194 --> 00:56:19,435
Yeah.

1375
00:56:19,755 --> 00:56:21,857
So I just wonder like how you deal with that kind of...

1376
00:56:22,759 --> 00:56:29,086
We really try to make a case with it as a product and we had, September we had a roadshow.

1377
00:56:29,914 --> 00:56:33,656
And look, SocialPoint was very data driven, so it was very easy, but still I had,

1378
00:56:34,276 --> 00:56:38,778
I was sitting down with directors of products and VPs, and I was trying to explain to them

1379
00:56:39,339 --> 00:56:43,681
why before they even start developing, not the A-B test, when they think about a feature,

1380
00:56:44,261 --> 00:56:48,983
I want to be there and do an estimate of the impact, because I want to make sure that as soon as I can,

1381
00:56:49,503 --> 00:56:52,064
I can cancel something that I don't think will have an impact.

1382
00:56:52,805 --> 00:56:55,226
And it's a process, it's a process you need to go through.

1383
00:56:56,088 --> 00:56:56,809
Thanks.

1384
00:56:57,309 --> 00:56:59,931
It's education, but when you do it

1385
00:56:59,971 --> 00:57:01,772
and you say this pricing would not work

1386
00:57:01,852 --> 00:57:04,013
and they don't listen, and the pricing doesn't work,

1387
00:57:04,053 --> 00:57:04,793
next time they listen.

1388
00:57:05,353 --> 00:57:05,774
Thank you very much.

1389
00:57:05,794 --> 00:57:06,034
All right.

1390
00:57:07,114 --> 00:57:07,315
Yes.

1391
00:57:07,355 --> 00:57:07,655
Thank you.

1392
00:57:08,515 --> 00:57:10,376
In talking about the low number of users

1393
00:57:10,416 --> 00:57:11,417
and testing them early on,

1394
00:57:11,577 --> 00:57:13,618
you had mentioned as the first bullet point

1395
00:57:13,758 --> 00:57:14,979
using something that you already knew.

1396
00:57:15,379 --> 00:57:16,319
Yeah.

1397
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:17,780
I wanna make sure I understand correctly.

1398
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,741
Are you talking about basically verifying

1399
00:57:19,781 --> 00:57:20,782
an assumption you already have

1400
00:57:21,042 --> 00:57:22,103
or measuring the effect of it?

1401
00:57:22,423 --> 00:57:23,603
How exactly is that helping you?

1402
00:57:23,931 --> 00:57:26,714
user data, what I mean using something you know, when you

1403
00:57:26,754 --> 00:57:29,536
come to a test, if this is the first game you've done, and you

1404
00:57:29,556 --> 00:57:33,820
have no user data, it's not very applicable. But, you know, if

1405
00:57:33,861 --> 00:57:37,003
you have already a baseline for the conversion rates, you have a

1406
00:57:37,044 --> 00:57:38,945
baseline for what people spend their money on.

1407
00:57:39,806 --> 00:57:41,347
or where your best users are coming from,

1408
00:57:41,907 --> 00:57:43,527
you can integrate that into the model

1409
00:57:43,868 --> 00:57:46,289
and it would really lower the number of users

1410
00:57:46,309 --> 00:57:50,070
you need to collect to have a statistical conclusion.

1411
00:57:50,450 --> 00:57:52,151
So it's just taking the numbers you have,

1412
00:57:52,691 --> 00:57:55,892
the KPIs, into the model as a factor.

1413
00:57:55,992 --> 00:57:58,333
You change the model from being naive

1414
00:57:58,353 --> 00:57:59,794
and every case is its own case,

1415
00:58:00,642 --> 00:58:02,483
to taking answers you already have.

1416
00:58:03,004 --> 00:58:03,504
That's what I mean.

1417
00:58:03,604 --> 00:58:03,964
Make sense?

1418
00:58:04,385 --> 00:58:04,525
Okay.

1419
00:58:04,885 --> 00:58:06,086
I had a second question too.

1420
00:58:07,127 --> 00:58:09,810
In getting your company to adopt the lean startup model,

1421
00:58:10,610 --> 00:58:12,792
was that something that came from a top-down approach

1422
00:58:12,872 --> 00:58:14,594
or did you meet a lot of resistance

1423
00:58:14,654 --> 00:58:15,975
in getting your company to adopt it?

1424
00:58:16,395 --> 00:58:18,217
So this is a funny story

1425
00:58:18,257 --> 00:58:20,779
because I was sitting with the CEOs and the founders

1426
00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:22,100
and I was trying to pitch them on this.

1427
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:23,181
They've been doing this for a year.

1428
00:58:24,111 --> 00:58:27,456
I was just trying to say, and they were very polite because they're Spanish, and

1429
00:58:27,496 --> 00:58:29,360
they were like, yeah, yeah, they're listening to me, but

1430
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:31,483
the company was already doing Lean Startup.

1431
00:58:32,064 --> 00:58:36,412
What I did was really change how analytics can become the champion of this.

1432
00:58:37,371 --> 00:58:42,533
I think a big part of lean startup is the experiments and the measuring.

1433
00:58:43,313 --> 00:58:47,415
And the biggest problem you have if you're trying to be lean is when data doesn't run

1434
00:58:47,455 --> 00:58:48,295
as fast as the business.

1435
00:58:48,715 --> 00:58:53,978
This is why so much of what we did was just make it a lot faster, make it a lot more lean.

1436
00:58:54,818 --> 00:58:56,158
But it was coming from the top down.

1437
00:58:56,358 --> 00:58:57,879
They were already doing lean before I started.

1438
00:59:01,186 --> 00:59:01,306
Hi.

1439
00:59:01,346 --> 00:59:01,406
Hi.

1440
00:59:01,566 --> 00:59:04,608
Question on the topic that you talked about, the AA variants,

1441
00:59:04,648 --> 00:59:05,788
instead of doing AB.

1442
00:59:06,429 --> 00:59:09,951
And you said serving the two different AA models

1443
00:59:09,991 --> 00:59:12,352
to two different populations to differ variants.

1444
00:59:13,873 --> 00:59:16,854
I don't know if I missed it, but how random

1445
00:59:16,934 --> 00:59:18,015
are those two populations?

1446
00:59:18,035 --> 00:59:20,817
So for example, do you control for something, at least

1447
00:59:20,857 --> 00:59:21,437
for those two?

1448
00:59:21,477 --> 00:59:21,997
Like, for example.

1449
00:59:22,330 --> 00:59:27,594
does one, like A1, for example, is a population of whales,

1450
00:59:27,714 --> 00:59:30,576
and then A2 is maybe a population of players

1451
00:59:30,596 --> 00:59:31,317
that have never spent?

1452
00:59:31,337 --> 00:59:32,838
Like, do you control for anything at all,

1453
00:59:32,918 --> 00:59:34,219
or is it just completely random?

1454
00:59:34,739 --> 00:59:36,160
So, excellent question.

1455
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:36,781
I'll just repeat.

1456
00:59:36,801 --> 00:59:38,222
So, the question is, when I...

1457
00:59:39,468 --> 00:59:41,089
say you go to that group, you go to that group,

1458
00:59:41,449 --> 00:59:43,511
how much thought is behind that?

1459
00:59:43,551 --> 00:59:45,712
Am I just randomly assigning people to groups

1460
00:59:45,772 --> 00:59:47,994
or do I take what I know about them before I assign?

1461
00:59:48,674 --> 00:59:50,175
I don't assign usually by whales.

1462
00:59:50,555 --> 00:59:53,277
When I analyze, I look at how many whales were there

1463
00:59:53,337 --> 00:59:54,718
to gain context for my analysis,

1464
00:59:54,738 --> 00:59:56,920
but I don't control for whales.

1465
00:59:56,980 --> 00:59:58,641
If one group, it's, when you do it

1466
00:59:59,101 --> 01:00:01,022
with a big enough audience, statistically,

1467
01:00:01,443 --> 01:00:03,704
you should get somewhat balanced,

1468
01:00:04,245 --> 01:00:05,485
unless you do it with a very small group.

1469
01:00:06,066 --> 01:00:07,427
The other thing is I do,

1470
01:00:08,783 --> 01:00:14,726
factor that into my analysis, I don't say, do it by demographics, or I make sure that we have a good

1471
01:00:14,766 --> 01:00:19,868
representation of all the countries. Unless I think country is super specific for that feature, if I

1472
01:00:19,928 --> 01:00:25,571
think this is going to be something that's highly paid, and it's less meaningful to test in the

1473
01:00:25,611 --> 01:00:29,533
Philippines than in Canada and the US, I might control for that. But most of the time, I don't,

1474
01:00:30,194 --> 01:00:34,336
I can if I want to, most of the time I don't, when I do the analysis, it's one of the main things I

1475
01:00:34,356 --> 01:00:34,596
look at.

1476
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:35,848
All right.

1477
01:00:35,868 --> 01:00:36,830
Thank you.

1478
01:00:37,070 --> 01:00:37,491
Okay, cool.

1479
01:00:37,872 --> 01:00:39,575
I think we have time for one more question.

1480
01:00:39,835 --> 01:00:41,798
Yes, one more question there.

1481
01:00:41,818 --> 01:00:43,241
Thank you for your presentation.

1482
01:00:44,402 --> 01:00:48,229
Actually, my question pretty similar to the previous person.

1483
01:00:50,249 --> 01:00:53,271
When you do the analysis, well, before you do the analysis,

1484
01:00:53,992 --> 01:00:57,375
you've got to understand how do you view the audience

1485
01:00:57,475 --> 01:01:02,279
for variation A and variation B so that they would be similar

1486
01:01:03,219 --> 01:01:06,762
in terms of geo, in terms of source.

1487
01:01:08,604 --> 01:01:12,126
But as I understood, you were talking

1488
01:01:12,166 --> 01:01:15,029
about testing on old users.

1489
01:01:15,794 --> 01:01:20,398
So how do you build audience among old users?

1490
01:01:22,259 --> 01:01:25,782
Because, well, usually there are not enough users

1491
01:01:25,963 --> 01:01:27,584
to make a representative analysis.

1492
01:01:28,585 --> 01:01:29,366
It depends on you.

1493
01:01:29,466 --> 01:01:31,448
So the question is, if I understand correctly,

1494
01:01:31,468 --> 01:01:33,389
when I do this with old users?

1495
01:01:34,310 --> 01:01:38,053
How do you build audiences among old users

1496
01:01:38,234 --> 01:01:39,355
when you run A-B tests?

1497
01:01:39,841 --> 01:01:44,749
So for me at SocialPoint, my life is pretty good in that regard because I have users who

1498
01:01:44,769 --> 01:01:48,015
have been playing the game since 2012 and they're still paying.

1499
01:01:48,616 --> 01:01:51,301
So actually my active user base is very high.

1500
01:01:52,277 --> 01:01:54,979
I really do things differently.

1501
01:01:55,019 --> 01:01:56,859
And one of the things we're doing right now with the team

1502
01:01:56,919 --> 01:02:00,381
is to try to distinguish when you do a test for new users,

1503
01:02:01,041 --> 01:02:02,882
and when you do a test for existing users,

1504
01:02:03,283 --> 01:02:04,883
what are the things you need to pay attention to?

1505
01:02:04,923 --> 01:02:06,764
This is actually something that we're trying

1506
01:02:06,804 --> 01:02:08,645
to expand on right now.

1507
01:02:09,946 --> 01:02:13,628
But at SocialPoint, that problem of not having enough

1508
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:15,588
existing users is usually not the case.

1509
01:02:15,608 --> 01:02:17,029
The problem is that we'll be trying something

1510
01:02:17,069 --> 01:02:18,070
that is level 25.

1511
01:02:19,846 --> 01:02:22,329
and you have had to play an alliance in the last live ops,

1512
01:02:22,409 --> 01:02:23,711
and that really narrows it down.

1513
01:02:24,051 --> 01:02:25,974
So those who might run longer,

1514
01:02:26,514 --> 01:02:28,577
those are the ones who actually take a lot longer to run.

1515
01:02:28,918 --> 01:02:29,098
Yeah.

1516
01:02:30,339 --> 01:02:30,560
Okay?

1517
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:31,140
Thank you.

1518
01:02:31,501 --> 01:02:32,402
All right, thanks everyone.
