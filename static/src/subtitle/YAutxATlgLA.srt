1
00:00:05,641 --> 00:00:08,984
everybody a reminder to uh either uh silence or skillfully

2
00:00:09,104 --> 00:00:15,469
muffle your cell phones. And also a reminder to please fill

3
00:00:15,489 --> 00:00:18,332
out those surveys that they'll be emailing out to you guys. If

4
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,994
you like what you've seen it'll really help us presenters and

5
00:00:21,034 --> 00:00:22,576
it'll help GDC give you more of what you want.

6
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,301
So uh thanks for uh all coming out to my panel. Um I know you've

7
00:00:28,321 --> 00:00:30,642
got a lot of choices, I mean Nintendo's going on right now

8
00:00:30,762 --> 00:00:33,443
and Nier Automata is going on right now and I'm like wow

9
00:00:33,463 --> 00:00:35,724
that's uh that's a pretty tough crowd to go up against so thanks

10
00:00:35,764 --> 00:00:39,166
for uh showing up to uh Primal Rage 2. So uh that's what I'll

11
00:00:39,186 --> 00:00:42,107
be talking about today. I'll be talking about Primal Rage 2, a

12
00:00:42,147 --> 00:00:44,088
game that was cancelled and never made it to release.

13
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:47,850
Project cancellation is a developer's greatest fear. Years

14
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:50,731
of life effort can be destroyed, often caused by circumstances

15
00:00:50,771 --> 00:00:51,531
beyond our control.

16
00:00:52,512 --> 00:00:54,674
So perhaps, like some of you may have endured,

17
00:00:55,034 --> 00:00:57,537
it happened to me, and it changed my life profoundly.

18
00:00:58,298 --> 00:01:00,640
However, this story takes some twists and turns,

19
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:03,303
and has a different ending than you might expect.

20
00:01:05,004 --> 00:01:07,166
So I'm Chris Tang, I'm the senior game designer

21
00:01:07,226 --> 00:01:09,048
at Indie Dev Genasia Hitsparx Games.

22
00:01:09,628 --> 00:01:12,291
My current project is a tentatively titled Strike Harbinger,

23
00:01:12,732 --> 00:01:14,994
a hyper exciting high speed, high frame rate

24
00:01:15,034 --> 00:01:17,116
spiritual successor to the arcade rail shooter

25
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:18,738
coming out hopefully in the next year

26
00:01:18,798 --> 00:01:20,280
for PC, arcade, and console.

27
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,102
While I'm not a programmer by trade,

28
00:01:22,122 --> 00:01:23,643
it's the first game I've done all the gameplay code

29
00:01:23,663 --> 00:01:25,565
and systems for, so I'm particularly proud of it.

30
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:30,648
Also, our character crossover partner, FX Unit Yuki, is a newly developed indie action

31
00:01:30,668 --> 00:01:35,930
platformer for the old NEC TurboGrafx-16 Super CD console format, I don't know if anyone

32
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:40,992
remembers that, uh it just went to get its discs pressed, so it should be available sometime

33
00:01:41,032 --> 00:01:41,272
soon.

34
00:01:41,673 --> 00:01:43,393
I did some additional writing and design on that.

35
00:01:45,517 --> 00:01:49,803
Going way back, I have experience working on the Tetris franchise, Transformers, many

36
00:01:49,823 --> 00:01:53,888
Capcom games with Street Fighter 3 and Street Fighter Alpha 3 in particular, the Primal

37
00:01:53,928 --> 00:01:58,393
Rage games at Atari of course, and console titles going back to the Genesis and NES days

38
00:01:58,433 --> 00:02:00,055
at Tengen like Gauntlet 4 and Rampart.

39
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:04,177
I also have a competitive gaming background and am best known for being the Sega World

40
00:02:04,217 --> 00:02:07,797
Champion as broadcast around the world on MTV in 1994.

41
00:02:08,358 --> 00:02:12,978
I'm also the 1990 NWC Los Angeles City Champion and the Hawaii State Nintendo Champion.

42
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:17,019
I'm still active in eSports as a commentator for the Tetris World Championships going on

43
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:22,680
nine years now, and I am the voice of the boom Tetris for Jeff meme that has been going

44
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,761
around lately, which is kind of an embarrassing story.

45
00:02:25,161 --> 00:02:26,441
You know about the boom Tetris for Jeff?

46
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:33,211
Yeah, if you haven't heard of that, it's like, there's like a video with like 7 million views,

47
00:02:33,331 --> 00:02:37,555
and at the Tetris tournament a couple years ago, I kept saying, boom Tetris for Jeff.

48
00:02:37,856 --> 00:02:42,620
And now anytime people see someone make a Tetris, they'll comment like, boom Tetris for Jeff.

49
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,403
It's got like 10,000 comments, and most of them say boom Tetris for Jeff.

50
00:02:45,664 --> 00:02:49,307
They made like a t-shirt for it, and there's these compilation memes with like screens

51
00:02:49,367 --> 00:02:52,911
exploding and stuff. It's pretty crazy, but yeah, that's my voice. It's my fault.

52
00:02:54,468 --> 00:02:56,229
So yeah, it's been a pretty crazy run.

53
00:02:56,469 --> 00:02:59,670
But this story starts off with my life at Atari Games.

54
00:03:00,371 --> 00:03:01,911
So at the Nintendo World Championships in 1990,

55
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:04,952
I met one of the supervisors at Tengen.

56
00:03:05,112 --> 00:03:06,793
So that's the console division of Atari Games.

57
00:03:07,213 --> 00:03:08,553
Not to be confused with Atari Corp,

58
00:03:08,573 --> 00:03:10,094
which made the computers and the consoles.

59
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:15,342
I began working there a couple of weeks later and started doing odd jobs like QA, product

60
00:03:15,402 --> 00:03:18,127
evaluations, game counseling, manual writing, and translation.

61
00:03:18,808 --> 00:03:23,074
I was quite possibly the youngest person ever to regularly work there, and I was living

62
00:03:23,094 --> 00:03:24,376
my dream at a very early age.

63
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,381
Even back then, I had a deep interest and respect for the history of Atari.

64
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:35,224
Iconic developers like Ed Logg and Earl Vickers, who worked on favorites like Asteroids, Gauntlet,

65
00:03:35,264 --> 00:03:37,586
and 720 Degrees, roamed the halls.

66
00:03:38,246 --> 00:03:39,287
I even got to work with some of them.

67
00:03:40,027 --> 00:03:43,669
Back then, fanboying about early game developer legends and telling them how much I appreciated

68
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:45,190
their work might have freaked them out.

69
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:49,932
I spent my lunches studying replay and game machine trade magazines on the floor of the

70
00:03:49,972 --> 00:03:52,413
executive's office, immersing myself in the history there.

71
00:03:54,043 --> 00:03:58,105
Atari resembled a tech city where there was a department for whatever needed to get done.

72
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:04,808
Wood shop, metal shop, video lab, PCB design, sound studio, administration, and the cafeteria.

73
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:09,149
With the incredible talent and resources there, the potential for the future felt limitless.

74
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:13,231
There was no other place like it, and there was a strong culture there that was all its

75
00:04:13,331 --> 00:04:13,471
own.

76
00:04:14,731 --> 00:04:16,432
Some of the friends I've made there are friends for life.

77
00:04:16,772 --> 00:04:17,913
I consider them like family.

78
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:21,234
There's a reason why we still have Atari reunions years after its closure.

79
00:04:21,674 --> 00:04:23,335
I don't even know if that's a thing in other companies.

80
00:04:25,158 --> 00:04:26,799
So for me, this was a very exciting time.

81
00:04:27,239 --> 00:04:28,840
Everything there had a huge impact on me.

82
00:04:29,241 --> 00:04:30,081
It's where I grew up.

83
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,463
I wasn't sure if I fit in due to my age and lifestyle,

84
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,104
as most devs there back in those days

85
00:04:35,144 --> 00:04:36,265
saw games as only a job,

86
00:04:36,545 --> 00:04:37,886
and they never played them outside of work.

87
00:04:38,307 --> 00:04:40,528
Whereas to me, video games were my entire life.

88
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:42,669
But I'm glad that things in this industry

89
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:43,910
have changed for the better in this regard,

90
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,231
and a much higher proportion of people

91
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:46,592
who actually play games and love them

92
00:04:46,632 --> 00:04:47,453
are working on them now.

93
00:04:49,374 --> 00:04:49,494
So.

94
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:52,151
Not long after I started working at Tengen,

95
00:04:52,511 --> 00:04:54,212
Street Fighter II was released in the arcades.

96
00:04:54,932 --> 00:04:56,552
After work I would go to Sunnyvale Golf Land,

97
00:04:56,572 --> 00:04:58,033
which was a ground zero of fighting games

98
00:04:58,353 --> 00:05:00,213
where Capcom put their games on location test.

99
00:05:03,514 --> 00:05:05,215
It was the original site of the Evo Tournament Series

100
00:05:05,255 --> 00:05:05,635
going back to 1996.

101
00:05:06,235 --> 00:05:08,656
I won many competitions and this trophy

102
00:05:08,676 --> 00:05:10,837
is from the very first official Street Fighter II

103
00:05:10,857 --> 00:05:13,577
tournament ever held on May 30th, 1991.

104
00:05:14,238 --> 00:05:14,958
I came in third.

105
00:05:15,498 --> 00:05:17,038
The karate dude on it's pretty cool too.

106
00:05:19,158 --> 00:05:21,099
So my expertise didn't go unnoticed by the company.

107
00:05:21,379 --> 00:05:23,061
Atari wanted to get in on the fighting game craze,

108
00:05:23,161 --> 00:05:25,262
and it was developing one with robots called Cyberstorm.

109
00:05:25,983 --> 00:05:27,624
It was in bad shape with poor gameplay,

110
00:05:27,824 --> 00:05:28,584
and they put me on the team

111
00:05:28,624 --> 00:05:29,705
to try to salvage what was there.

112
00:05:30,266 --> 00:05:32,347
Even though I was able to improve the gameplay considerably,

113
00:05:32,607 --> 00:05:35,109
the robots that were in the game didn't look cool,

114
00:05:35,429 --> 00:05:37,311
and they had stiff animations which couldn't be fixed.

115
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:39,012
The game was ultimately canceled,

116
00:05:39,392 --> 00:05:40,933
but because I didn't like the game,

117
00:05:40,953 --> 00:05:41,974
it didn't really affect me much.

118
00:05:43,575 --> 00:05:45,816
However, it was the first time I got to innovate a feature.

119
00:05:47,049 --> 00:05:48,590
It was the first game to have a combo meter.

120
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:51,111
Fighting game players loved to find and perform combos,

121
00:05:51,211 --> 00:05:52,871
but Atari didn't know much about those mechanics.

122
00:05:53,191 --> 00:05:55,052
So I devised a feature where if a character was hit

123
00:05:55,392 --> 00:05:56,713
and was hit again before the character

124
00:05:56,753 --> 00:05:57,753
returned to their ready state,

125
00:05:58,173 --> 00:05:59,594
a number would count up how many hits

126
00:06:00,154 --> 00:06:01,575
and reward the players with a point bonus.

127
00:06:02,155 --> 00:06:04,456
The game went out on test at Golf Land

128
00:06:04,516 --> 00:06:05,336
before it was canceled.

129
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:08,057
A few weeks later, people noticed that the test versions

130
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,718
of Capcom's Super Street Fighter II

131
00:06:10,018 --> 00:06:11,839
started incorporating a similar feature

132
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:14,120
with the same wording right down to the point bonuses

133
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,320
that nobody uses anymore.

134
00:06:16,286 --> 00:06:19,168
I guess I won't be too offended, they did end up hiring me later on.

135
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:24,572
So while I was working on Cyberstorm, another project started codenamed T-Rex.

136
00:06:25,092 --> 00:06:29,495
I knew the game's programmer and would play on the Research Street Fighter 2 in the game

137
00:06:29,535 --> 00:06:32,337
room and he'd have me check out his project after I kicked his ass.

138
00:06:33,158 --> 00:06:36,780
It evolved into what we now call Primal Rage and once I was available to work on it full

139
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,721
time I joined their team.

140
00:06:39,162 --> 00:06:42,146
So I won't go too much into Primal Rage 1 as it was released and well documented.

141
00:06:42,506 --> 00:06:44,548
It was a fighting game with dinosaurs and beast-like characters.

142
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:47,592
My role on the Rage 1 team was gameplay-centric.

143
00:06:48,072 --> 00:06:52,577
I implemented character gameplay, collision hitboxes, move animation timings, AI scripting,

144
00:06:52,998 --> 00:06:54,339
general game balancing and tuning.

145
00:06:55,901 --> 00:06:56,402
In the arcades...

146
00:06:57,283 --> 00:07:00,665
The stop motion beast made the game very popular with kids and casual players.

147
00:07:01,165 --> 00:07:03,146
It wasn't a huge hit with the fighting game fanatics, though.

148
00:07:03,466 --> 00:07:04,807
There were things I wasn't allowed to fix.

149
00:07:05,287 --> 00:07:08,069
The special move inputs were not like other games, and they were really awkward.

150
00:07:08,589 --> 00:07:12,031
Kids couldn't find the moves, so the players that were most interested in playing the game

151
00:07:12,051 --> 00:07:13,212
were the least able to enjoy it.

152
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,520
Still, the game did very well.

153
00:07:16,881 --> 00:07:18,981
It was considered the number one arcade game of 1994,

154
00:07:19,322 --> 00:07:21,403
and when it came time to port the game to home consoles,

155
00:07:21,643 --> 00:07:22,463
they went all out.

156
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:25,564
More than 10 platforms, Super Nintendo, Genesis,

157
00:07:25,725 --> 00:07:29,866
Game Boy, Game Gear, PlayStation, Saturn, 32X,

158
00:07:30,447 --> 00:07:35,309
PC, Jaguar, 3DO, Amiga, and even the Tiger R-Zone.

159
00:07:36,169 --> 00:07:37,670
It sold a million units right off the bat

160
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,051
and enjoyed a certain amount of success

161
00:07:39,331 --> 00:07:40,951
in a market that was tough and unforgiving.

162
00:07:42,137 --> 00:07:43,978
and it became a very successful brand for Atari.

163
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:46,320
Virtual knights such as comic books, toys, novels,

164
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,120
and apparel were made.

165
00:07:47,821 --> 00:07:49,783
We were even in talks to have an animated series produced,

166
00:07:49,823 --> 00:07:51,204
but we turned down offers since we wanted

167
00:07:51,244 --> 00:07:52,805
better production companies to be involved.

168
00:07:53,305 --> 00:07:54,786
Otherwise it would have turned out like Double Dragon.

169
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,788
The toys were very good.

170
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,452
So Primal Rage became one of the games in the spotlight

171
00:08:01,512 --> 00:08:03,713
as video game violence was a new hot button topic.

172
00:08:04,174 --> 00:08:05,535
Primal Rage has this fear of gore

173
00:08:06,015 --> 00:08:07,216
with characters able to do things

174
00:08:07,256 --> 00:08:08,597
like punch each other's brains out

175
00:08:08,877 --> 00:08:09,958
and eat the human tribesmen.

176
00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:11,499
And then there was this.

177
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:15,937
Golden Showers.

178
00:08:16,657 --> 00:08:18,218
In addition to the blood, gore, and violence,

179
00:08:18,238 --> 00:08:19,959
there is an especially infamous finishing move

180
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,800
where one of the ape-like characters urinates

181
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,161
on their defeated opponent, burning their flesh away.

182
00:08:24,802 --> 00:08:26,062
When angry parents found out,

183
00:08:26,143 --> 00:08:27,503
it was pulled from some store shelves,

184
00:08:27,723 --> 00:08:29,224
and the game made its way into the headlines.

185
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:30,905
Our team took it in stride,

186
00:08:30,945 --> 00:08:32,726
as I guess any publicity was good publicity

187
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:33,446
back in those days.

188
00:08:35,457 --> 00:08:37,938
Even back in 1994, games were starting to receive updates

189
00:08:37,998 --> 00:08:40,399
with new ROMs to fix problems or add features

190
00:08:40,439 --> 00:08:43,721
in the hopes of improving the earnings income performance.

191
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:45,801
We released at least two updates

192
00:08:45,861 --> 00:08:47,582
and planned for a third which would add a boss character

193
00:08:47,622 --> 00:08:48,763
since the game didn't have one yet.

194
00:08:50,223 --> 00:08:51,504
But the success of the game assured

195
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:52,464
the development of a sequel,

196
00:08:52,484 --> 00:08:54,245
so we decided to skip the version three update

197
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,766
and the boss character for a full-blown Primal Rage 2.

198
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,543
Primal Rage made good earnings from kids and casual players, and they played against a

199
00:09:01,563 --> 00:09:01,944
computer.

200
00:09:02,264 --> 00:09:05,127
But that wasn't the kind of coin drop that Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat games were

201
00:09:05,147 --> 00:09:08,089
making through competitive play, which was the kind of earnings that management wanted

202
00:09:08,129 --> 00:09:08,950
if we were to make a sequel.

203
00:09:10,427 --> 00:09:12,968
So those two ape-like beasts, Blizzard and Chaos,

204
00:09:12,988 --> 00:09:14,448
were by far the most played characters.

205
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:15,829
Even in Killer Instinct,

206
00:09:15,849 --> 00:09:17,489
which is another 1994 fighting game,

207
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,551
less humanoid characters like Riptor and Sabrewolf

208
00:09:20,671 --> 00:09:22,731
were the least picked, despite them being powerful.

209
00:09:23,232 --> 00:09:24,752
Fighting game players just preferred characters

210
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:26,053
that could hit with their arms and legs

211
00:09:26,393 --> 00:09:28,134
instead of biting or using their tail.

212
00:09:28,894 --> 00:09:30,655
Since our game was practically all beasts,

213
00:09:31,015 --> 00:09:32,675
what could be done to make a successful sequel

214
00:09:32,855 --> 00:09:33,936
with Primal Rage brand?

215
00:09:35,636 --> 00:09:37,257
And the solution was kind of strange.

216
00:09:41,646 --> 00:09:46,388
So, I recount the day when Dennis, our producer, ran into my cube and proclaimed that he figured

217
00:09:46,408 --> 00:09:47,048
out the solution.

218
00:09:47,568 --> 00:09:49,029
Mighty Morphin Power Ragers.

219
00:09:49,709 --> 00:09:53,530
The idea was to have titan-sized human avatars that could morph into a beast form and back.

220
00:09:54,231 --> 00:09:57,072
Players could hit the top row of buttons, which would morph the character into beast

221
00:09:57,112 --> 00:09:59,913
mode, performing a flashy auto-combo sequence and morph back.

222
00:10:00,353 --> 00:10:03,334
Players could also pick a beast character that could conversely morph into their human

223
00:10:03,354 --> 00:10:03,554
form.

224
00:10:04,543 --> 00:10:06,324
Experts could also pick a third meta version

225
00:10:06,344 --> 00:10:08,104
that could morph at will but didn't auto combo.

226
00:10:08,784 --> 00:10:10,265
This dynamic would make it so that the game

227
00:10:10,285 --> 00:10:12,365
was accessible to beginners with the easy super moves

228
00:10:12,505 --> 00:10:14,785
for the normal versions, but still be deep for experts

229
00:10:14,805 --> 00:10:16,866
who could do manual combos with the advanced one.

230
00:10:17,866 --> 00:10:20,026
At first I was like, what, is this gonna work?

231
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,387
But I ended up loving the idea

232
00:10:22,447 --> 00:10:24,127
because we could have proper human combatants

233
00:10:24,187 --> 00:10:26,088
while retaining our theme and maybe get some new

234
00:10:26,128 --> 00:10:27,608
cool gameplay mechanics in the process.

235
00:10:28,288 --> 00:10:30,068
This was a risk that the human characters

236
00:10:30,188 --> 00:10:31,829
would not be well received in a game

237
00:10:31,849 --> 00:10:33,029
known for its dinos and beasts.

238
00:10:34,423 --> 00:10:36,843
And so here are our character designs,

239
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:39,504
and here's some concept art that I was able to rescue.

240
00:10:39,684 --> 00:10:41,204
So some of the only ones out there.

241
00:10:42,045 --> 00:10:43,685
Production on our human characters

242
00:10:44,025 --> 00:10:45,265
went in the order that you see here,

243
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:46,526
with Arak being the first.

244
00:10:47,186 --> 00:10:49,646
Each human avatar combatant has a corresponding beast god

245
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:50,507
that they are connected to,

246
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,187
and retained design elements of their sponsoring deity,

247
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:54,308
God Beast.

248
00:10:55,248 --> 00:10:56,268
They are leaders of their tribe,

249
00:10:56,388 --> 00:10:57,548
chosen to channel their powers.

250
00:10:58,761 --> 00:11:01,362
Here you can see them with their corresponding beast god counterpart.

251
00:11:01,842 --> 00:11:05,784
In the story, Necrosan, the game's final boss, banishes the beast gods, who must then physically

252
00:11:05,844 --> 00:11:10,906
manifest themselves to the tribe's avatar, granting them special abilities and titan-like

253
00:11:10,946 --> 00:11:11,806
size in the process.

254
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:14,387
And here's the other characters.

255
00:11:15,627 --> 00:11:19,469
As in the first Primal Rage, not all player characters are good guys, but a mix of virtuous

256
00:11:19,529 --> 00:11:22,750
and destructive personalities which tend to match their prehistoric beast counterpart.

257
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:26,156
Diablo's avatar was originally conceived to be a female,

258
00:11:26,517 --> 00:11:27,757
but the proposed concept was weak

259
00:11:27,797 --> 00:11:29,718
and we were lacking a villain-esque male character

260
00:11:29,738 --> 00:11:32,059
in the roster, so we ended up with an executioner

261
00:11:32,099 --> 00:11:33,460
like Sinjin, which worked out really great.

262
00:11:36,582 --> 00:11:39,243
While we were creating the eight new humanoid titans,

263
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:40,844
we also needed to create one new beast god

264
00:11:40,864 --> 00:11:41,664
to fill out the roster.

265
00:11:42,064 --> 00:11:43,985
Slashfang, the saber-toothed god of combat,

266
00:11:44,025 --> 00:11:46,466
has a familiar humanoid body type despite being a beast.

267
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:49,388
Also new was a final boss character, Necrosan.

268
00:11:49,808 --> 00:11:50,969
His story brings together the lore

269
00:11:50,989 --> 00:11:52,189
of both Primal Rage games.

270
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:59,095
He's an undead bone dragon being the spawn of an asteroid egg that caused the cataclysms and emergence of the beast characters of the first game.

271
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:03,038
Now fully matured, he threatens to drain the life force of every living thing on earth.

272
00:12:03,499 --> 00:12:07,322
And in case you missed it, Necrosan is Japanese for Mr. Death.

273
00:12:10,004 --> 00:12:15,429
Now even though they were only in Primal Rage 2 as a game, both Slash Fang and Necrosan made it into toy form.

274
00:12:15,909 --> 00:12:21,534
Necrosan is particularly valuable as it was worth several hundred dollars sealed in the box, like the one from my collection I have pictured here.

275
00:12:23,685 --> 00:12:24,066
Cha-ching!

276
00:12:25,668 --> 00:12:30,455
So, images of the Primal Rage 2 character designs did end up in some magazines and comics.

277
00:12:30,955 --> 00:12:34,320
Additionally, the core story of Primal Rage 2 featuring the human avatars was conveyed

278
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,082
in the Primal Rage novelization.

279
00:12:36,102 --> 00:12:37,564
A fun fact.

280
00:12:38,387 --> 00:12:40,548
slash fang's avatar, his full name is actually

281
00:12:40,568 --> 00:12:43,750
Xiaoming Tangquan, which happened as a result

282
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,632
of the team being unable to agree on a name.

283
00:12:46,272 --> 00:12:48,754
It's a mashup of all the Asian core team members,

284
00:12:49,174 --> 00:12:50,595
two of the programmers and myself.

285
00:12:51,215 --> 00:12:53,797
Our product manager came up with it on the fly,

286
00:12:54,097 --> 00:12:55,959
and while the intent was borderline racist,

287
00:12:56,719 --> 00:12:59,021
the situation was hilarious and everybody liked it.

288
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,924
That's Dennis, our producer, posing in the main hallway to the Rage Lab,

289
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:09,189
and on the right, a posable wire puppet mold pole for Slash Bang that I used to design his moves.

290
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:13,914
The game was initially formally initiated as a project on March 1st, 1995,

291
00:13:14,635 --> 00:13:20,222
with a budget of 2.3 million dollars, which for a game in that era was a very large sum.

292
00:13:21,378 --> 00:13:23,739
We were a team of 20, the largest team in CoinUp

293
00:13:23,939 --> 00:13:26,540
at the time, mostly art, animation, and programming.

294
00:13:27,301 --> 00:13:29,122
Additional costs associated with stop motion

295
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,103
included the manufacture of the armatured puppets

296
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:34,244
to be animated, specialized stop motion animators,

297
00:13:34,424 --> 00:13:36,085
we got these guys from Hollywood, they were really great,

298
00:13:36,926 --> 00:13:38,406
and graphics processing support staff.

299
00:13:38,847 --> 00:13:40,828
The stop motion process also added a great deal

300
00:13:40,868 --> 00:13:43,069
of time to the schedule, which is an art burden

301
00:13:43,109 --> 00:13:45,190
much greater than that of traditional 2D pixel art,

302
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,111
3D pre-rendering, or real-time 3D.

303
00:13:49,576 --> 00:13:51,896
So this is a rare Polaroid photo that I took

304
00:13:51,936 --> 00:13:53,517
of the final armatured production puppets

305
00:13:53,597 --> 00:13:55,017
used to create stop motion for the game,

306
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:56,557
back when they were brand new.

307
00:13:57,217 --> 00:13:59,538
They have since disintegrated and no longer exist,

308
00:14:00,318 --> 00:14:01,998
or what's left of them looks like a T-800.

309
00:14:02,979 --> 00:14:04,839
The puppets were painted in garish odd colors

310
00:14:05,119 --> 00:14:06,199
to be able to do palette swaps

311
00:14:06,359 --> 00:14:07,620
and to read well for photography.

312
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,000
On the right, you can see a completed standing ready

313
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,441
sequence for the Kena character after being animated,

314
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:14,101
processed, and implemented into the game.

315
00:14:16,168 --> 00:14:19,231
Like on Rage 1, my role was gameplay-centric, now expanded.

316
00:14:19,712 --> 00:14:21,494
I got to design mostly everything from the ground up,

317
00:14:21,554 --> 00:14:23,876
character attacks, effects, hitboxes, balancing,

318
00:14:24,157 --> 00:14:26,399
the CPU's AI, and the overall fighting quality.

319
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,563
Implementing AI behaviors is an interesting thing

320
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:30,163
in a fighting game.

321
00:14:30,544 --> 00:14:31,685
They become like your children.

322
00:14:32,106 --> 00:14:33,087
You're teaching them how to fight

323
00:14:33,147 --> 00:14:35,209
and handle various situations, and they take after you.

324
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:36,951
When your product is out in the field,

325
00:14:37,673 --> 00:14:40,415
you really hope that they can fend for themselves and put on a good show.

326
00:14:40,955 --> 00:14:43,537
Sometimes you make one character feel so fun and powerful

327
00:14:43,877 --> 00:14:46,759
that you then have to go back and make all their siblings just as strong

328
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:49,761
and hope that the whole family ends up being badass and awesome.

329
00:14:51,121 --> 00:14:54,664
I also wrote lore and story for the universe Bible that our licensees use for our toys,

330
00:14:55,004 --> 00:14:56,185
comics, novels, etc.

331
00:14:56,285 --> 00:14:59,607
I was super happy I got to write content that ended up on the backs of toys

332
00:14:59,887 --> 00:15:03,029
since I was a big fan of stuff like G.I. Joe and Transformers that had stuff like that.

333
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,324
Because of the high cost and lengthy process

334
00:15:06,344 --> 00:15:08,244
of stop motion animation, we had to be sure

335
00:15:08,404 --> 00:15:10,105
every frame was one that we wanted or needed.

336
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:13,206
Moves started off as a concept video or sketch,

337
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,327
which was adapted into a 2D storyboard

338
00:15:15,367 --> 00:15:16,627
that could be flip-booked and tweaked.

339
00:15:17,187 --> 00:15:18,888
Once approved, our stop motion animators

340
00:15:18,908 --> 00:15:20,648
would bring them to life with the armatured puppet

341
00:15:20,949 --> 00:15:23,069
moving it one frame at a time to be photographed.

342
00:15:23,569 --> 00:15:25,110
The photos would then be cleaned up and scaled

343
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:27,251
by our interns in the graphics processing dungeon.

344
00:15:28,091 --> 00:15:29,512
And only then could they be put in the game.

345
00:15:31,292 --> 00:15:32,973
So I'll be showing you some videos of this process.

346
00:15:35,095 --> 00:15:38,737
Most of the hand-drawn storyboards let us cut frames and determine whether it was good

347
00:15:38,777 --> 00:15:39,657
enough for stop motion.

348
00:15:40,018 --> 00:15:44,379
So this sequence that you're about to see was not one used in the game, but it was the

349
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,041
only hand-drawn storyboard that survived to this day that I have.

350
00:15:47,661 --> 00:15:51,102
So the in-game move at the end was the closest final animation I could find, so sorry about

351
00:15:51,142 --> 00:15:51,343
that.

352
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,946
That's Steve Riesenberger, our production coordinator.

353
00:15:58,986 --> 00:15:59,386
Great guy.

354
00:15:59,406 --> 00:16:01,587
That's a hand-drawn animation.

355
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,551
and the closest sequence in the game I could find

356
00:16:05,811 --> 00:16:06,472
that looks like that.

357
00:16:06,492 --> 00:16:08,652
So it was a pretty involved process.

358
00:16:13,174 --> 00:16:14,295
I don't remember how to close that.

359
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:19,517
And this next video will show many moves

360
00:16:19,557 --> 00:16:22,238
from their video sequences, or their video references

361
00:16:22,258 --> 00:16:23,498
to their final in-game animation.

362
00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:25,599
Note how fast some of these animations got

363
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:27,220
once they were implemented into the gameplay.

364
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,200
This is a lot of fun.

365
00:17:13,771 --> 00:17:14,391
That's Felix.

366
00:17:14,731 --> 00:17:15,812
He's the Atari IT guy.

367
00:17:15,852 --> 00:17:19,093
That was nice.

368
00:17:20,094 --> 00:17:21,934
Just happened to be trained in Filipino stick fighting.

369
00:17:21,954 --> 00:17:24,055
That was good.

370
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:33,340
You don't want to mess with that IT guy.

371
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:39,364
I got to do the beasts too.

372
00:17:43,986 --> 00:17:45,567
Fuck.

373
00:17:52,652 --> 00:17:56,814
Yeah, the cameraman is Luis. He was the storyboard animator.

374
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,435
Great guy to work with. Totally miss him.

375
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:05,843
Cool.

376
00:18:06,404 --> 00:18:06,884
Suicide.

377
00:18:14,315 --> 00:18:16,559
Dennis, our producer, hamming it up.

378
00:18:36,005 --> 00:18:47,588
Excellent.

379
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:49,868
You might notice that these were all shot all around the company in the

380
00:18:49,888 --> 00:18:52,669
cafeteria, weight room, conference room, random empty rooms.

381
00:18:53,329 --> 00:18:53,809
Holy shit.

382
00:18:53,869 --> 00:18:55,150
Holy shit.

383
00:19:00,565 --> 00:19:02,667
So yeah, we tried to use the blue or green screens

384
00:19:02,707 --> 00:19:04,408
if we could, but sometimes we would just do it

385
00:19:04,448 --> 00:19:06,230
wherever we could to get the job done fast,

386
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:07,731
and sometimes stuff got wrecked.

387
00:19:08,031 --> 00:19:08,311
Whoops.

388
00:19:11,794 --> 00:19:15,076
Okay, so that was how we got some of our animations

389
00:19:15,136 --> 00:19:15,997
and move designs done.

390
00:19:16,718 --> 00:19:19,279
And as you can see, I was pretty into what I was working on.

391
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,101
I was a huge fan of fighting games

392
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:24,203
and did Shoryuken and Hadouken on my friends

393
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:25,224
all the time in real life.

394
00:19:25,504 --> 00:19:27,105
So creating new moves for fighting games

395
00:19:27,145 --> 00:19:28,987
and getting to act them out as part of the job

396
00:19:29,267 --> 00:19:30,268
was pretty awesome.

397
00:19:31,908 --> 00:19:33,289
Our game was a product of the time.

398
00:19:34,369 --> 00:19:36,430
Nothing like this would be made now due to the cost,

399
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:39,731
because stop motion talent and necessary infrastructure

400
00:19:39,751 --> 00:19:40,932
just wouldn't exist now.

401
00:19:41,632 --> 00:19:44,733
We had 1,500 to 2,000 frames of animation per character,

402
00:19:45,133 --> 00:19:46,934
full unique frames as parts of each pose

403
00:19:46,954 --> 00:19:49,094
were not reused to save money like other games.

404
00:19:51,335 --> 00:19:52,656
This quantity was way up from 400

405
00:19:52,716 --> 00:19:55,277
from Primal Rage 1 per character,

406
00:19:55,797 --> 00:19:57,337
with the total being even more massive,

407
00:19:57,377 --> 00:19:59,198
going from seven characters to 17.

408
00:20:00,058 --> 00:20:00,598
Lots of memory.

409
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:06,004
So to facilitate the animation, custom hardware had to be created along with special routines

410
00:20:06,044 --> 00:20:06,805
on the software end.

411
00:20:07,286 --> 00:20:10,830
The first few frames of animation were stored in ROM, and when an animation was called up,

412
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:13,532
it would load the remaining frames off the hard drive into RAM for playback.

413
00:20:13,973 --> 00:20:16,896
This was untested, cutting-edge, theoretical technology.

414
00:20:17,457 --> 00:20:20,260
It was hoped that the frames would be loaded fast enough to be displayed in time.

415
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,604
It was difficult to get it right, and it caused graphics glitches when it didn't.

416
00:20:24,502 --> 00:20:26,722
We were also loading music, pre-rendered background angles,

417
00:20:26,762 --> 00:20:29,724
and FMV movies off the drive, some of them at the same time.

418
00:20:29,924 --> 00:20:31,424
So we were getting a lot of use out of it.

419
00:20:31,865 --> 00:20:34,065
Hard drive use in arcade games was rare at this time,

420
00:20:34,205 --> 00:20:36,406
and the term streaming hadn't even been coined yet.

421
00:20:37,747 --> 00:20:39,187
The game was ahead of its time in doing things

422
00:20:39,288 --> 00:20:41,288
that weren't possible or practical for home conversions.

423
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,129
It created an experience that you could only get

424
00:20:43,169 --> 00:20:45,170
in the arcade, but that was a double-edged sword,

425
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:47,351
as a home port attempt would not have been up to snuff,

426
00:20:47,651 --> 00:20:49,031
and that may have caused potential problems

427
00:20:49,071 --> 00:20:50,772
for the game's existence going into the future.

428
00:20:52,536 --> 00:20:55,357
And despite some great things and ideas in motion,

429
00:20:55,978 --> 00:20:57,498
there are many difficulties that contributed

430
00:20:57,538 --> 00:20:58,699
to an eventual cancellation,

431
00:20:58,819 --> 00:21:00,420
so now we'll take a look at some of those factors.

432
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,801
So Primal Rage was a very ambitious project,

433
00:21:04,321 --> 00:21:05,562
even by Atari game standards.

434
00:21:06,002 --> 00:21:07,063
We planned to ship in the summer of 1996,

435
00:21:07,763 --> 00:21:08,643
but that schedule slipped,

436
00:21:08,943 --> 00:21:10,464
due to the lengthy stop motion process

437
00:21:10,624 --> 00:21:11,745
and hardware migrations.

438
00:21:13,352 --> 00:21:18,476
For budget and political reasons, management stuck us on Jaguar derivative hardware called

439
00:21:18,616 --> 00:21:22,759
Kojag, which was underpowered and performed worse than the Primal Rage 1 arcade hardware.

440
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,702
Killer Instinct had raised the bar for graphics, so we had to be competitive.

441
00:21:27,223 --> 00:21:30,966
Trying to run on the inferior Kojag hardware cost us dearly in time, effort, and morale.

442
00:21:32,227 --> 00:21:37,250
A bit later, but just in time, an arcade variant of the PSX Sony hardware became available.

443
00:21:37,962 --> 00:21:40,283
It was capable of quality in 2D and 3D,

444
00:21:40,503 --> 00:21:41,803
and gave us translucency and effects

445
00:21:41,843 --> 00:21:43,464
that look impressive to this very day,

446
00:21:44,044 --> 00:21:45,605
as well as play field scaling necessary

447
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:46,946
for a fighting game with huge characters.

448
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:49,427
Though relying on this non-internal hardware

449
00:21:49,467 --> 00:21:50,547
may have led to other factors

450
00:21:50,567 --> 00:21:51,788
contributing to our cancellation,

451
00:21:52,108 --> 00:21:54,089
we could now make this a competitive product,

452
00:21:54,649 --> 00:21:55,790
despite some additional delays

453
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,370
as a result of having to migrate again.

454
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:57,431
So.

455
00:22:00,368 --> 00:22:02,390
The process, taking something from concept

456
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:05,132
to eventual implementation in the game, was too lengthy,

457
00:22:05,792 --> 00:22:07,393
mostly due to graphics processing time.

458
00:22:07,813 --> 00:22:09,695
It took months to get a character playable,

459
00:22:09,955 --> 00:22:11,536
and that made my job that much harder

460
00:22:11,576 --> 00:22:14,998
since the whole game had to play well as a cohesive work.

461
00:22:16,379 --> 00:22:18,060
Puppet design and manufactured lead time

462
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,181
made character pre-visualization impossible.

463
00:22:20,722 --> 00:22:22,563
People to this day sometimes feel

464
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:24,704
that the human characters look a bit freakish or ugly,

465
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:26,145
and to be honest, they didn't look

466
00:22:26,933 --> 00:22:28,653
quite how I would have wanted.

467
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:31,234
But by the time the ball was rolling, nothing could be done.

468
00:22:31,714 --> 00:22:34,235
A physical model for graphics meant absolute commitment.

469
00:22:34,695 --> 00:22:36,876
What our characters have looked better or cooler

470
00:22:36,896 --> 00:22:39,057
with smaller heads and more realistic proportions,

471
00:22:39,397 --> 00:22:40,277
we had no way of knowing.

472
00:22:40,897 --> 00:22:42,798
But this doesn't take away from the beautiful results

473
00:22:42,818 --> 00:22:43,818
of stop motion animation.

474
00:22:44,639 --> 00:22:47,419
It's just that the time, expense, and inability to pivot

475
00:22:47,579 --> 00:22:50,000
was simply the nature of the beast, no pun intended.

476
00:22:51,783 --> 00:22:53,885
We never had a basic but polished vertical slice

477
00:22:53,925 --> 00:22:54,346
of the game.

478
00:22:54,966 --> 00:22:57,708
For example, a single playable character fighting themselves,

479
00:22:58,009 --> 00:23:00,090
one background, with a few moves and effects,

480
00:23:00,451 --> 00:23:01,592
running solid and looking good.

481
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:05,015
While we knew what we were shooting for,

482
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:06,916
we were never able to demonstrate that

483
00:23:07,076 --> 00:23:08,137
to a decision-making entity,

484
00:23:08,397 --> 00:23:10,439
and that made it much more likely for a plug to be pulled

485
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,061
before we were looking representative of our final form.

486
00:23:13,902 --> 00:23:15,603
The technical hurdles, such as hard drive streaming,

487
00:23:15,664 --> 00:23:17,225
also contributed to instability

488
00:23:17,425 --> 00:23:19,166
and a general glitchy look during development.

489
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:24,453
The game went on field test before characters were completed or balanced, and they lacked

490
00:23:24,473 --> 00:23:25,213
their finishing moves.

491
00:23:25,794 --> 00:23:28,976
Slips in schedule may have been the cause, but showing a game before it's ready can ruin

492
00:23:29,016 --> 00:23:30,077
its chances for success.

493
00:23:30,657 --> 00:23:35,401
Capcom fighting games of that era on test were indistinguishable from their finished

494
00:23:35,441 --> 00:23:35,781
product.

495
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:40,124
On the other hand, Primal Rage 2 went on in test when it was still buggy, incomplete,

496
00:23:40,184 --> 00:23:43,346
and unoptimized, and it earned poorly on test as a result.

497
00:23:45,147 --> 00:23:45,648
Kind of unfair.

498
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:49,455
So aside from our schedule slipping and other production

499
00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:51,296
issues, there is a major event that happened right

500
00:23:51,316 --> 00:23:52,237
in the middle of our project.

501
00:23:53,638 --> 00:23:56,900
In March of 1996, Atari Games was sold to WMS.

502
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,182
They're the parent company of Williams Midway,

503
00:23:59,202 --> 00:24:01,764
the makers of Mortal Kombat and the manufacturers of Killer

504
00:24:01,804 --> 00:24:02,164
Instinct.

505
00:24:02,945 --> 00:24:05,027
So nothing to take away from the great creators

506
00:24:05,047 --> 00:24:07,709
that they had there, but the management people that owned

507
00:24:07,769 --> 00:24:09,350
them ended up buying us.

508
00:24:10,231 --> 00:24:11,471
There were other bidders in contention,

509
00:24:11,652 --> 00:24:13,613
such as Nolan Bushnell, but unfortunately, we

510
00:24:13,653 --> 00:24:14,874
were bought by our direct competition.

511
00:24:16,212 --> 00:24:20,454
Despite being told that things would be business as usual, a restructuring and reduction in

512
00:24:20,474 --> 00:24:21,094
force followed.

513
00:24:22,015 --> 00:24:26,237
Entire departments and long-time positions going back to the 70s were eliminated.

514
00:24:26,817 --> 00:24:31,019
The family which had existed since the beginning of the video game industry was being disassembled.

515
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:33,300
The loss of morale was apocalyptic.

516
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,563
Even those who weren't laid off started to leave when they saw the writing on the wall.

517
00:24:37,264 --> 00:24:40,568
Skipping ahead, this led to the closure of the company in the next six years,

518
00:24:40,928 --> 00:24:43,371
when it had existed for 25 previously.

519
00:24:43,992 --> 00:24:47,275
The amount of history and legacy destroyed caused by this event is immeasurable.

520
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:51,661
So for us, Primal Rage as a brand ate into Mortal Kombat,

521
00:24:51,681 --> 00:24:53,382
which was highly successful for WMS.

522
00:24:54,122 --> 00:24:56,263
The new management's commitment was put to the test

523
00:24:56,283 --> 00:24:57,944
when we asked what characters from Mortal Kombat

524
00:24:57,984 --> 00:24:59,064
we could use due to the merger,

525
00:24:59,504 --> 00:25:01,365
and our request was outright refused,

526
00:25:01,665 --> 00:25:03,046
despite a history of sharing characters

527
00:25:03,086 --> 00:25:04,546
within their own point op products,

528
00:25:04,926 --> 00:25:07,427
and then them having used Mortal Kombat actors

529
00:25:07,467 --> 00:25:09,088
to promote Nintendo's killer instinct.

530
00:25:10,107 --> 00:25:12,992
I don't think they wanted our product to be released no matter how good or profitable

531
00:25:13,052 --> 00:25:13,633
it would have been.

532
00:25:14,053 --> 00:25:17,619
It felt as though we were bought only to be gutted and then eliminated like Leland and

533
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:21,967
Tradewest who WMS had purchased before us and there was no trace left of them.

534
00:25:23,442 --> 00:25:27,245
I didn't think our project was in danger, though, since Primal Rage was such a strong

535
00:25:27,265 --> 00:25:28,966
brand with licensing deals in process.

536
00:25:29,607 --> 00:25:32,629
I continued to work very hard, as I knew we were entering the home stretch.

537
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:36,952
At some point, I was told to dial it back, to wait to hear back from management, just

538
00:25:36,992 --> 00:25:38,013
in case things went south.

539
00:25:38,434 --> 00:25:43,177
But being young and stubborn, I did not, and secretly worked late into the night and didn't

540
00:25:43,217 --> 00:25:44,278
care if I was told not to.

541
00:25:44,798 --> 00:25:48,201
I wanted to see our game become the best it could be, because I envisioned players around

542
00:25:48,221 --> 00:25:49,682
the world having a blast with it.

543
00:25:50,925 --> 00:25:51,726
But that was not to be.

544
00:25:52,247 --> 00:25:53,208
The game was canceled.

545
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:57,132
Within a couple of work weeks left in the year,

546
00:25:57,272 --> 00:25:58,594
we were given a chance to wrap things up

547
00:25:58,614 --> 00:26:00,036
before the project would be mothballed.

548
00:26:00,776 --> 00:26:02,518
Team members were encouraged to join other projects

549
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:03,520
to avoid being laid off.

550
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:08,272
So a special meeting was announced on the day we were,

551
00:26:08,552 --> 00:26:10,413
we sent off our distributor milestone

552
00:26:10,433 --> 00:26:11,413
for national field testing.

553
00:26:11,794 --> 00:26:14,355
This was likely the first version that had mostly stable,

554
00:26:14,735 --> 00:26:16,396
complete characters with some fatalities.

555
00:26:17,217 --> 00:26:18,978
It's probably the version that's out in the wild right now.

556
00:26:19,818 --> 00:26:21,539
At that meeting, on December 5th, 1996,

557
00:26:22,339 --> 00:26:23,660
our project was officially canceled.

558
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,941
Checking the dates, it's apparent that the decision

559
00:26:25,981 --> 00:26:27,902
was made long before the milestone had been seen,

560
00:26:27,922 --> 00:26:30,544
so that meant we pretty much never had a chance.

561
00:26:32,326 --> 00:26:33,587
It would have been very difficult to produce

562
00:26:33,647 --> 00:26:35,147
a straight to home conversion of the game.

563
00:26:35,868 --> 00:26:37,309
Consoles of the time could barely pull off

564
00:26:37,349 --> 00:26:39,290
an acceptable Primal Rage 1,

565
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:41,351
and it wouldn't be until a decade later

566
00:26:41,411 --> 00:26:43,232
with the PlayStation 3's hard drive installs

567
00:26:43,512 --> 00:26:45,453
that a proper Primal Rage 2 could be made.

568
00:26:47,114 --> 00:26:49,195
With the time I had left, I kept working hard

569
00:26:49,255 --> 00:26:50,595
and polished things up to the very end.

570
00:26:51,156 --> 00:26:52,696
I didn't know any other way of operating,

571
00:26:53,037 --> 00:26:54,137
and I'm not even sure if I went home.

572
00:26:54,955 --> 00:26:57,958
I remember the last day when we were all in the lab and I was hammering on things until

573
00:26:57,998 --> 00:27:01,682
the last second and my last batch of edits almost didn't get in.

574
00:27:02,342 --> 00:27:05,746
And now I wonder to this day if the final lab version is out there somewhere waiting

575
00:27:05,766 --> 00:27:06,406
to be discovered.

576
00:27:08,348 --> 00:27:11,691
So cancellation for a game feels like non-existence for it.

577
00:27:12,052 --> 00:27:14,514
You can't convey the art of gameplay through pictures or video.

578
00:27:14,834 --> 00:27:15,755
It must be experienced.

579
00:27:17,264 --> 00:27:20,627
I was probably more devastated than I realized, and I was still in disbelief.

580
00:27:21,027 --> 00:27:24,069
I think subconsciously I was preparing to deal with the loss in some way so that I could

581
00:27:24,089 --> 00:27:24,650
move forward.

582
00:27:25,791 --> 00:27:29,654
I came back after the holidays and had to face the reality that the game was not going

583
00:27:29,694 --> 00:27:30,234
to be released.

584
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:34,477
I did not join another team, despite there being another fighting game project I could

585
00:27:34,497 --> 00:27:34,998
have gone to.

586
00:27:35,498 --> 00:27:39,501
I sort of chose to be laid off, and even though I was very loyal to Atari games as a core

587
00:27:39,581 --> 00:27:39,862
ideal...

588
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,261
It wasn't really the same company anymore, not after WMS had taken over.

589
00:27:45,022 --> 00:27:47,603
I packed up my desk, preserving what I could, and said my goodbyes.

590
00:27:48,464 --> 00:27:52,226
Our producer arranged for me to have a Primal Rage 2 prototype cabinet set aside for me

591
00:27:52,366 --> 00:27:55,528
so I could come and pick it up at some point, but that would prove to be a bit difficult.

592
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:58,709
So how did I deal with what happened?

593
00:27:58,969 --> 00:27:59,890
How did I move forward?

594
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:04,712
Helpless, crushing heartbreak and despair was about to overcome me, and it seemed that

595
00:28:04,732 --> 00:28:05,253
all was lost.

596
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:12,701
By some miracle, I had a job lined up at Capcom Japan.

597
00:28:13,581 --> 00:28:15,882
While Primal Rage 2 was my life in so many ways,

598
00:28:16,202 --> 00:28:17,723
working at Capcom was also a dream.

599
00:28:18,323 --> 00:28:20,043
They made the games I already loved.

600
00:28:20,903 --> 00:28:23,484
And the problems I had trying to get a quality game

601
00:28:23,504 --> 00:28:25,685
made at Atari would be a non-issue at Capcom,

602
00:28:25,725 --> 00:28:28,286
who, back in 1997, still knew how

603
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:29,246
to make great fighting games.

604
00:28:34,636 --> 00:28:36,837
When I left Atari, I intended to come back and visit,

605
00:28:37,097 --> 00:28:38,337
get more of my stuff that was left

606
00:28:38,777 --> 00:28:39,838
with coworkers and friends,

607
00:28:40,198 --> 00:28:42,119
including that Primal Rage 2 arcade cabinet

608
00:28:42,499 --> 00:28:43,919
and a Turbo Duo and dev kit,

609
00:28:43,939 --> 00:28:46,300
which is worth a lot of money now, but I didn't.

610
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,601
They had a reunion that same year in 1997

611
00:28:48,841 --> 00:28:49,901
and I didn't even go.

612
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:51,642
Out of sight, out of mind.

613
00:28:52,878 --> 00:28:54,499
Working at Capcom Japan was a perfect job

614
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:55,719
to help me forget what had happened,

615
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,721
giving me a sense of advancement and purpose.

616
00:28:58,081 --> 00:28:59,482
I was living my dream of working on games

617
00:28:59,502 --> 00:29:00,562
that players truly loved.

618
00:29:00,902 --> 00:29:02,683
However, I did miss being intimately involved

619
00:29:02,703 --> 00:29:03,944
with the design of a single game

620
00:29:03,984 --> 00:29:05,965
as much as I was with Primal Rage 2.

621
00:29:06,606 --> 00:29:08,847
While I contributed to many Capcom games proudly,

622
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,188
their fighting games would probably still be okay

623
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:12,889
without my help, at least in 97.

624
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:16,091
Atari actually needed me, and I kind of missed that.

625
00:29:17,772 --> 00:29:22,557
I'm unsure if this happens naturally in the process of moving on, but my memories and

626
00:29:22,597 --> 00:29:27,442
perception of everything that I had been involved at, at Atari, had began to erode.

627
00:29:27,942 --> 00:29:31,326
I treated it as if it had been a bad relationship with a bad breakup.

628
00:29:31,886 --> 00:29:32,267
I remember...

629
00:29:33,293 --> 00:29:38,678
I began to remember Primal Rage 2 as being this horrible, ugly, buggy mess, a terrible

630
00:29:38,718 --> 00:29:42,721
game that I didn't want anybody to see, something I should be ashamed of for its failure to

631
00:29:42,761 --> 00:29:43,241
be released.

632
00:29:43,722 --> 00:29:47,004
And I think this had a lot to do with the game being in such a bad state for so long,

633
00:29:47,064 --> 00:29:49,867
up until the very end, and that's the impression that stuck with me.

634
00:29:50,387 --> 00:29:54,610
Perhaps this was some way of coping, to devalue my memory of it, to make it easier to forget.

635
00:29:55,191 --> 00:29:58,473
In these years, I didn't talk much about Primal Rage 2 and tried to avoid the subject.

636
00:30:00,445 --> 00:30:04,972
So a couple of years later, there was another fighting game at Atari that was under development

637
00:30:04,992 --> 00:30:08,797
that had gone through various incarnations until its final form, Tenth Degree.

638
00:30:09,438 --> 00:30:12,923
And it was finally competitive with Capcom fighting games in terms of art style and gameplay.

639
00:30:13,364 --> 00:30:16,168
Friends of mine, formerly of Capcom, were actually in charge of the design.

640
00:30:17,303 --> 00:30:19,604
But I learned too that it too had been canceled.

641
00:30:20,225 --> 00:30:22,106
It was a little vindicating since, in my mind,

642
00:30:22,146 --> 00:30:24,587
I felt since it was better than Primal Rage 2 in some ways,

643
00:30:24,967 --> 00:30:26,487
might have been more deserving of release.

644
00:30:27,148 --> 00:30:28,628
And since it got canned, it's like,

645
00:30:28,828 --> 00:30:30,209
well, what hope did my game have, right?

646
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:34,712
So my supervisor at Capcom and I went to Atari

647
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:37,514
to see if there's any way we could salvage the project.

648
00:30:37,895 --> 00:30:38,775
But nothing became of it.

649
00:30:39,356 --> 00:30:41,398
I didn't think to try and get my remaining belongings,

650
00:30:41,578 --> 00:30:42,839
like my Primal Rage 2 machine,

651
00:30:43,199 --> 00:30:44,700
or maybe rescue some of its assets,

652
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:46,462
which is something I kind of regret now,

653
00:30:46,862 --> 00:30:48,383
as it was probably my last chance.

654
00:30:50,165 --> 00:30:55,010
After the cancellation of countless projects in February 2003, with less than 30 employees

655
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:59,174
remaining, Atari Games, then known as Midway Games West, was closed.

656
00:30:59,895 --> 00:31:04,399
The home where I grew up, along with its history and what remained of Primal Rage 2, was gone

657
00:31:04,459 --> 00:31:04,799
forever.

658
00:31:07,172 --> 00:31:09,094
I mistakenly believed I would always be around,

659
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:10,915
and I could always go back whenever I wanted.

660
00:31:11,335 --> 00:31:13,197
But time happens, and the world changes.

661
00:31:13,697 --> 00:31:14,938
Whenever there is a company closure,

662
00:31:15,198 --> 00:31:17,300
the history and resources that are lost or destroyed

663
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:20,042
is immeasurable, especially for a company

664
00:31:20,062 --> 00:31:21,763
that had been standing for so long.

665
00:31:22,904 --> 00:31:24,825
I further pushed back the memories I had of working there

666
00:31:24,845 --> 00:31:26,406
and the joy that I felt being a part of it.

667
00:31:27,067 --> 00:31:28,788
I felt the same helpless, crushing despair

668
00:31:28,828 --> 00:31:30,149
I felt when my project was canceled.

669
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:32,791
But the next time they had a reunion, I definitely went,

670
00:31:33,212 --> 00:31:34,713
and I would never miss another one again.

671
00:31:36,164 --> 00:31:38,647
Years passed, and time marched on relentlessly.

672
00:31:40,229 --> 00:31:44,554
In the post-2000 era, arcades began to die and production of new arcade games slowed

673
00:31:44,834 --> 00:31:45,835
as they fell out of style.

674
00:31:46,456 --> 00:31:50,882
An era of emulated arcade games began, and while most of them would become playable on

675
00:31:50,902 --> 00:31:53,645
computers through emulation, Primal Rage 2 did not.

676
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:58,422
With its special custom hardware and unorthodox graphics delivery methods, that made sense.

677
00:31:58,983 --> 00:32:02,785
But later I found out from one of the programmers that they had booby-trapped the code to prevent

678
00:32:02,805 --> 00:32:04,285
bootlegging and reverse engineering.

679
00:32:04,746 --> 00:32:08,668
The lack of emulation meant that it would remain unplayed by the public, sealing its

680
00:32:08,728 --> 00:32:09,748
fate to be forgotten.

681
00:32:10,949 --> 00:32:15,891
I continued to feel rather disassociated with Primal Rage, although it started bothering

682
00:32:15,911 --> 00:32:18,513
me that I didn't go back to pick up my Rage 2 prototype arcade machine.

683
00:32:19,914 --> 00:32:22,255
The prototype arcade machine appeared at California Extreme,

684
00:32:22,595 --> 00:32:25,116
a retro arcade show here in the Bay Area in the early 2000s,

685
00:32:25,436 --> 00:32:27,137
but either the buttons or monitor didn't work,

686
00:32:27,277 --> 00:32:28,357
and that made me super sad.

687
00:32:28,737 --> 00:32:31,678
When I saw this as either an act of information charity,

688
00:32:31,998 --> 00:32:33,699
or maybe like leaving flowers on a grave,

689
00:32:34,219 --> 00:32:36,340
I left a primal rage to official move list

690
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,820
that I had made for the distributors

691
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,181
and duct taped it to the cabinet.

692
00:32:39,721 --> 00:32:41,121
Pictures of this flyer would circulate

693
00:32:41,161 --> 00:32:43,362
on the internet thereafter, adding to the game's mystique.

694
00:32:44,997 --> 00:32:46,959
Sometime in the mid-2000s, out of curiosity,

695
00:32:47,259 --> 00:32:49,041
I did a random web search to see if anything

696
00:32:49,101 --> 00:32:50,502
on Primal Rage 2 had ever surfaced,

697
00:32:50,903 --> 00:32:52,344
hoping to find something along the lines

698
00:32:52,404 --> 00:32:55,167
of emulation progress, but I didn't find what I expected.

699
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:58,090
This is how I found out about a website called DeviantArt,

700
00:32:59,551 --> 00:33:02,014
and what would later come to be known as Rule 34.

701
00:33:04,369 --> 00:33:09,070
Apparently there were fans of Primal Rage 2 out there, and oddly fan art and fan fiction

702
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:12,051
of it existed, particularly of the female characters.

703
00:33:12,451 --> 00:33:16,352
Though I was slightly horrified, I marveled that enough people cared about, from what

704
00:33:16,392 --> 00:33:19,932
little there was out there, to be fans of these otherwise non-existent characters.

705
00:33:21,893 --> 00:33:26,354
So more time passed, and as such, things that become old become new and cool again through

706
00:33:26,374 --> 00:33:26,854
nostalgia.

707
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:31,481
The kids that had grown up with Primal Rage in the arcades and in their homes were now

708
00:33:31,521 --> 00:33:33,542
remembering the game with fondness, despite its flaws.

709
00:33:34,003 --> 00:33:37,985
So at conventions and gaming expos, I started to talk to fans about Primal Rage alongside

710
00:33:38,025 --> 00:33:39,266
things like Street Fighter and Tetris.

711
00:33:40,326 --> 00:33:43,988
Also around this time, YouTube started to become a thing, allowing people to share their

712
00:33:44,028 --> 00:33:46,530
nostalgia, views, and playthroughs on all games.

713
00:33:47,971 --> 00:33:50,073
In 2013, a video called Primal Rage 2,

714
00:33:50,413 --> 00:33:51,514
a forgotten legend appeared.

715
00:33:52,015 --> 00:33:53,696
This shared information that was known about

716
00:33:53,836 --> 00:33:54,877
Primal Rage 2 at the time,

717
00:33:55,338 --> 00:33:56,539
like the game's teasers that appeared

718
00:33:56,579 --> 00:33:57,560
in comics and magazines,

719
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,141
the broken state of the emulation,

720
00:33:59,422 --> 00:34:00,483
and some prototype footage.

721
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:02,204
The views and comments revealed

722
00:34:02,244 --> 00:34:03,886
that there was some desire to see it revived.

723
00:34:04,386 --> 00:34:06,088
For whatever reason, I still felt the game

724
00:34:06,108 --> 00:34:07,949
was this wretched thing that should remain buried,

725
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,511
so I dismissed it and chose not

726
00:34:09,531 --> 00:34:10,592
to take part in the discussion.

727
00:34:11,973 --> 00:34:13,475
And then, everything changed.

728
00:34:15,575 --> 00:34:17,416
The Galloping Ghost Arcade in Brookfield, Illinois

729
00:34:17,456 --> 00:34:19,236
acquired a Primal Rage 2 prototype board

730
00:34:19,537 --> 00:34:21,417
and put it on a cabinet on their arcade floor

731
00:34:21,857 --> 00:34:23,658
and announced it on YouTube on June 21st, 2014.

732
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:26,919
For the uninitiated, the Galloping Ghost Arcade

733
00:34:26,979 --> 00:34:28,840
is one of the best and most notable arcades in the world,

734
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,400
housing 700 plus arcade games

735
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,321
with a new game released on their floor every Monday.

736
00:34:33,621 --> 00:34:36,242
But prior to this, I had never heard of the place before.

737
00:34:37,522 --> 00:34:39,783
The arcade live streamed Primal Rage 2 on Twitch

738
00:34:39,803 --> 00:34:41,964
for the next few days for all the world to see.

739
00:34:42,484 --> 00:34:43,684
I learned about the game being there

740
00:34:43,844 --> 00:34:44,564
and I watched the stream.

741
00:34:45,332 --> 00:34:47,274
The game looked better than I had remembered it to be.

742
00:34:47,294 --> 00:34:51,039
I was also taken aback by the positive things people were saying about the game and how

743
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:51,940
great they thought it played.

744
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:56,625
I ended up interacting with the people of the arcade through the Twitch chat, and some

745
00:34:56,645 --> 00:35:01,610
of the things that I knew about the game, like how you pick the secret characters by

746
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:04,914
holding up on the select boxes, even though my memories were still fuzzy.

747
00:35:06,291 --> 00:35:10,335
I watched the stream through its entire run, fixated on my unseen work and those who were

748
00:35:10,355 --> 00:35:11,776
experiencing it for the first time.

749
00:35:12,517 --> 00:35:16,641
I started to realize that maybe I had forgotten that at the very end of the project, maybe

750
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:18,262
the game didn't look so bad after all.

751
00:35:20,001 --> 00:35:25,186
So this was a mostly complete, multi-million dollar, AAA game from over 15 years ago, from

752
00:35:25,266 --> 00:35:28,649
out of nowhere, was suddenly unleashed into the internet era.

753
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:34,254
For most games, one could Google up an FAQ or watch a playthrough on YouTube, but nothing

754
00:35:34,274 --> 00:35:35,876
of the sort existed for Primal Rage 2.

755
00:35:36,336 --> 00:35:39,339
Its secrets were fresh, real, and ripe for discovery.

756
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,661
Those that were playing it were excitedly uncovering the game's special moves, combos,

757
00:35:43,681 --> 00:35:47,623
and finishers as they went, and the world watched along via stream as they were being

758
00:35:47,643 --> 00:35:48,624
discovered in real time.

759
00:35:49,184 --> 00:35:52,286
The arcade staff and players knew their stuff about fighting games, and as I watched them

760
00:35:52,306 --> 00:35:55,267
play and enjoy it, my perception of Primal Rage 2 began to change.

761
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,388
One could say that this is when my healing truly began.

762
00:36:00,249 --> 00:36:01,830
And Primal Rage 2 made news headlines.

763
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:06,132
It got covered on all the major sites, Joystick, Kotaku, Polygon, Structoid.

764
00:36:06,552 --> 00:36:07,433
This I did not expect.

765
00:36:08,693 --> 00:36:10,234
And especially the meaning of this,

766
00:36:10,474 --> 00:36:12,055
that Primal Rage 2 exists.

767
00:36:12,535 --> 00:36:14,315
It's kind of nice after all that happened.

768
00:36:16,116 --> 00:36:16,936
After the word got out,

769
00:36:16,976 --> 00:36:18,457
players began to travel to the arcade

770
00:36:18,497 --> 00:36:20,657
just to see and play the rare prototype game.

771
00:36:21,218 --> 00:36:23,518
Doc Mac, the owner of the Galloping Ghost Arcade,

772
00:36:24,058 --> 00:36:25,459
and its related businesses mentioned

773
00:36:25,739 --> 00:36:27,420
players coming in from around the world,

774
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,200
and a couple who hitchhiked their way

775
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,481
across the country to come and play Primal Rage 2.

776
00:36:31,801 --> 00:36:33,541
So pilgrimages were actually a thing.

777
00:36:33,562 --> 00:36:35,462
Oops.

778
00:36:36,566 --> 00:36:38,026
But this would only be the beginning of something

779
00:36:38,086 --> 00:36:38,807
even more amazing.

780
00:36:39,287 --> 00:36:41,528
The Galloping Ghosts Arcade, while already specializing

781
00:36:41,568 --> 00:36:44,089
in rare games, now fully realized the impact

782
00:36:44,129 --> 00:36:46,149
of making something unique and historic available.

783
00:36:46,589 --> 00:36:47,830
Games that never saw the light of day

784
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:50,111
now had a potential home where they could be maintained,

785
00:36:50,351 --> 00:36:51,911
protected, and most importantly,

786
00:36:52,351 --> 00:36:54,332
made available for people to play and enjoy.

787
00:36:55,152 --> 00:36:56,893
Many other prototypes would then be put

788
00:36:56,933 --> 00:36:59,614
onto the arcade floor, including Beavis and Butthead,

789
00:37:00,074 --> 00:37:01,775
Freeze the Cat, BioFreaks,

790
00:37:02,035 --> 00:37:03,795
and the infamous Tattoo Assassins.

791
00:37:06,468 --> 00:37:08,611
Galloping Ghosts also began to actively collaborate

792
00:37:08,651 --> 00:37:10,213
with creators who had unreleased games,

793
00:37:10,573 --> 00:37:12,455
restoring them and sometimes even finishing them

794
00:37:12,495 --> 00:37:13,736
to make them playable by the public.

795
00:37:14,497 --> 00:37:16,600
Jeff Lee of Qbert fame worked with them

796
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:18,962
to put Argus and Arena on the show floor,

797
00:37:19,162 --> 00:37:19,823
or the arcade floor.

798
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:21,804
and Brian Collin, who made Rampage,

799
00:37:22,064 --> 00:37:24,986
worked with them to produce Deathstalker the Specter Files,

800
00:37:25,126 --> 00:37:26,607
which was a canceled Laserdisc game.

801
00:37:27,207 --> 00:37:28,468
Its footage was shot in the 80s,

802
00:37:28,709 --> 00:37:30,029
so they had to convert it to digital,

803
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:32,211
and the entire game was redone in a modern engine.

804
00:37:32,731 --> 00:37:34,292
So now you can go to the game and play it

805
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:36,834
as an arcade machine, but you can also order

806
00:37:36,874 --> 00:37:38,675
the full arcade unit from them and purchase one.

807
00:37:39,076 --> 00:37:40,637
So it's definitely a significant effort

808
00:37:40,677 --> 00:37:43,258
in preserving games that would otherwise be lost forever.

809
00:37:45,375 --> 00:37:49,556
On March 28th, 2015, I was invited out to the Galloping Ghost Arcade for their Developers'

810
00:37:49,576 --> 00:37:53,857
Day event and finally got to play a fully functional Primal Rage 2 arcade game, something

811
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:56,157
I hadn't been able to do for what felt like an eternity.

812
00:37:56,738 --> 00:37:59,998
And likewise, from watching it on the stream, it was better than my mind had pictured it

813
00:38:00,058 --> 00:38:00,819
after all those years.

814
00:38:01,399 --> 00:38:05,240
What was even more amazing, though, was finally seeing the arcade itself, so filled with great

815
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:08,621
games and history you won't find anywhere else, and meeting the incredible people who

816
00:38:08,641 --> 00:38:09,881
could make a place like that possible.

817
00:38:11,194 --> 00:38:15,237
On their Planet Hollywood style developer VIP autograph picture wall, at least in this

818
00:38:15,277 --> 00:38:21,083
photo, my photo appears underneath Ed Boon, the Mortal Kombat guy, among other legends.

819
00:38:21,103 --> 00:38:22,705
It's pretty cool.

820
00:38:25,008 --> 00:38:26,809
So I didn't know this trading card existed

821
00:38:26,849 --> 00:38:28,489
until last November when I was being inducted

822
00:38:28,529 --> 00:38:30,650
into the International Video Game Hall of Fame in Iowa,

823
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:32,631
and someone came up to me for an autograph,

824
00:38:32,771 --> 00:38:33,651
and he showed me this card,

825
00:38:34,071 --> 00:38:36,052
and it mentions me being reunited with Primal Rage 2.

826
00:38:36,752 --> 00:38:38,513
So when I went back to the Galloping Ghost Arcade

827
00:38:38,533 --> 00:38:39,334
the next day, I was like,

828
00:38:39,694 --> 00:38:41,614
hey, no one told me they made a card for this.

829
00:38:42,175 --> 00:38:42,855
And then Pete Hahn,

830
00:38:42,975 --> 00:38:45,196
the Primal Rage high score world record champ,

831
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:46,957
who actually works there,

832
00:38:47,257 --> 00:38:48,697
was like, oh yeah, do you want some?

833
00:38:49,197 --> 00:38:51,038
So I have a few of these to give away to you guys

834
00:38:51,318 --> 00:38:53,199
if you can find me after the presentation.

835
00:38:54,961 --> 00:38:56,842
So that might have wrapped up the story quite nicely,

836
00:38:56,922 --> 00:38:59,123
but then the unimaginable happened.

837
00:39:00,444 --> 00:39:03,126
In 2017, Primal Rage 2 finally became playable

838
00:39:03,146 --> 00:39:03,866
through emulation.

839
00:39:04,426 --> 00:39:07,828
Long time efforts being made by YouTube user Gruntzilla94

840
00:39:08,369 --> 00:39:09,529
progressed significantly.

841
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:13,132
And in March of 2017, he released a modified version

842
00:39:13,172 --> 00:39:15,133
of MAME called MAME for Rage 2

843
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:17,594
that allows existing Primal Rage 2 ROMs

844
00:39:17,774 --> 00:39:18,875
out in the wild to be playable.

845
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:21,672
While emulation isn't 100% perfect yet,

846
00:39:21,812 --> 00:39:22,973
and there are glitches and crashes,

847
00:39:23,253 --> 00:39:25,294
it did more than the minimum that fans had hoped for.

848
00:39:26,475 --> 00:39:28,277
In some ways, the emulated game runs better

849
00:39:28,297 --> 00:39:30,458
than the actual hardware, as loading data within emulation

850
00:39:30,498 --> 00:39:34,081
is faster than that of a 1996 IDE hard drive interface

851
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:35,382
that we didn't get to optimize,

852
00:39:36,603 --> 00:39:39,245
leading to better frame rates and more consistent animation.

853
00:39:39,785 --> 00:39:41,847
A game ahead of its time that's able to scale up

854
00:39:41,887 --> 00:39:44,749
to the future for better performance is interesting indeed.

855
00:39:46,106 --> 00:39:48,147
With the game now able to be played by the masses,

856
00:39:48,467 --> 00:39:50,747
it would now have YouTube videos and streams on Twitch,

857
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:53,288
exposing it again to a new audience.

858
00:39:54,669 --> 00:39:57,049
And boom, Primal Rage 2 blows up in the news again.

859
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:59,710
Maybe more people cared about the game than I thought.

860
00:40:00,251 --> 00:40:02,051
But my favorite article to come out of all this

861
00:40:02,391 --> 00:40:03,331
was the end gadget one.

862
00:40:07,441 --> 00:40:09,342
2017's hottest new fighting game.

863
00:40:10,043 --> 00:40:11,683
Going from working your ass off on a game

864
00:40:11,704 --> 00:40:12,844
that never got to exist,

865
00:40:13,124 --> 00:40:15,706
to have it become 2017's hottest new fighting game

866
00:40:16,286 --> 00:40:18,467
20 years later, even if it's said in jest,

867
00:40:19,028 --> 00:40:21,029
that's a beast god tier level of vindication.

868
00:40:21,389 --> 00:40:22,430
I was completely floored.

869
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:24,951
But the real payoff and what really healed me

870
00:40:25,071 --> 00:40:27,252
as a game developer after having their dreams canceled

871
00:40:27,553 --> 00:40:29,774
so long ago, was getting to see players

872
00:40:29,834 --> 00:40:30,835
play the game and enjoy it.

873
00:40:31,938 --> 00:40:33,099
So there are a couple of videos here.

874
00:40:33,459 --> 00:40:35,119
Fair warning, there's some colorful language,

875
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:37,920
but for some reason, seeing people react this way

876
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,961
to something you've created is really quite satisfying,

877
00:40:40,081 --> 00:40:40,741
as you'll about see.

878
00:40:40,961 --> 00:40:42,882
And I also cleared it, so they said it was okay.

879
00:40:51,905 --> 00:40:52,385
Yes, I did it!

880
00:40:52,405 --> 00:40:54,545
So this is at Galloping Ghosts in 2014

881
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:56,266
when they were finding things in real time.

882
00:40:59,867 --> 00:40:59,947
Oh!

883
00:41:01,532 --> 00:41:03,473
Oh, shit! Yeah!

884
00:41:06,194 --> 00:41:07,115
I did a fatality!

885
00:41:08,455 --> 00:41:08,916
Yeah!

886
00:41:09,256 --> 00:41:10,937
That's not a little kid, by the way. He's a grown man.

887
00:41:14,118 --> 00:41:14,298
Oh, oh!

888
00:41:15,779 --> 00:41:16,519
Fatality!

889
00:41:20,121 --> 00:41:20,881
We got a new one!

890
00:41:28,464 --> 00:41:29,245
Well, there we go!

891
00:41:29,965 --> 00:41:30,845
Holy shit!

892
00:41:32,758 --> 00:41:33,558
Fatality!

893
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:44,560
Oh, shit!

894
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:47,360
Fatality!

895
00:41:49,001 --> 00:41:49,941
Did you guys see that?

896
00:41:49,961 --> 00:41:52,161
Did anyone see that? Please!

897
00:41:54,522 --> 00:41:57,602
And this is from 2017, uh, Super Best Friends Play.

898
00:41:58,142 --> 00:41:59,623
Oh my god, that's super strong.

899
00:41:59,643 --> 00:42:00,263
Do it! Do it!

900
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:02,580
Are there fatalities?

901
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,400
There are fatalities.

902
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:04,421
Any idea?

903
00:42:04,441 --> 00:42:06,441
OHHHHHHHHH!

904
00:42:07,022 --> 00:42:08,442
That was awesome I think!

905
00:42:08,462 --> 00:42:10,083
Okay, so now the weird part...

906
00:42:10,103 --> 00:42:11,683
Oh god, am I blizzard?

907
00:42:11,703 --> 00:42:13,464
Yeah, you can like...

908
00:42:13,484 --> 00:42:14,044
Oh shit!

909
00:42:14,104 --> 00:42:14,724
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

910
00:42:14,924 --> 00:42:15,604
I'm blizzard!

911
00:42:15,705 --> 00:42:16,865
Right, so and then you...

912
00:42:16,965 --> 00:42:18,546
Oh my god, Matt, you're so strong!

913
00:42:18,566 --> 00:42:19,386
Holy shit!

914
00:42:19,826 --> 00:42:21,787
Realizing through the arm of a dinosaur!

915
00:42:21,807 --> 00:42:23,067
No, you're a Saber Tooth Tiger!

916
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:23,747
That's cool!

917
00:42:23,767 --> 00:42:24,768
I turned into Slash Fang.

918
00:42:25,548 --> 00:42:31,171
Slash head. Yes. Against a bunch of dinos. Yeah, it had no body. But you fought them in the coolest stage.

919
00:42:31,191 --> 00:42:32,952
You fought them in like a bunch of karate karting.

920
00:42:33,172 --> 00:42:34,954
Holy shit!

921
00:42:34,994 --> 00:42:37,415
He's got a lot. He's got, he goes, he goes ham.

922
00:42:37,595 --> 00:42:39,736
Chaos. Unclear what's, what's strong yet.

923
00:42:39,756 --> 00:42:39,796
Oh.

924
00:42:40,117 --> 00:42:43,439
Oh! It lasts.

925
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:45,920
Why didn't this win the fan vote at EVO?

926
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,802
I don't, because people just don't know what's quality.

927
00:42:48,922 --> 00:42:49,902
Yeah, that's true.

928
00:42:49,982 --> 00:42:51,703
Holy shit! Do that!

929
00:42:51,723 --> 00:42:53,544
That thing's fast.

930
00:42:54,596 --> 00:42:55,397
That's nuts

931
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,702
Yeah big combo

932
00:43:01,462 --> 00:43:06,947
He's got a TV. Yeah. Yeah, I remember yes that I say that in an alternate reality where this did come out

933
00:43:07,728 --> 00:43:09,750
primal rage would have been a franchise

934
00:43:11,851 --> 00:43:13,573
That was super good

935
00:43:17,994 --> 00:43:19,714
Whoa!

936
00:43:21,035 --> 00:43:21,355
Oh!

937
00:43:21,395 --> 00:43:23,275
That is so elaborate.

938
00:43:23,656 --> 00:43:24,976
One Bloodborne, please.

939
00:43:26,817 --> 00:43:27,937
And it's Necro-san.

940
00:43:29,237 --> 00:43:30,278
Oh, Necro-san.

941
00:43:33,439 --> 00:43:34,099
Oh, my God.

942
00:43:34,119 --> 00:43:35,340
That's perfect.

943
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,200
Oh, my God, that's the best.

944
00:43:39,081 --> 00:43:39,781
Yeah, so...

945
00:43:40,922 --> 00:43:42,122
I finally got to see people

946
00:43:42,222 --> 00:43:42,942
enjoy the game.

947
00:43:44,502 --> 00:43:47,764
that was like an incredible feeling and a real gift.

948
00:43:48,124 --> 00:43:52,187
So years of just not knowing what it would have been like

949
00:43:52,367 --> 00:43:53,327
to have people play it,

950
00:43:53,607 --> 00:43:56,189
to suddenly having people play it was a thing.

951
00:43:57,470 --> 00:43:59,031
So after people finally got to enjoy it,

952
00:43:59,171 --> 00:44:01,992
it made me take a look back and look at it with new eyes.

953
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:04,514
In one sense, it's a demon that haunted me for a while,

954
00:44:04,814 --> 00:44:06,795
but in order for me to learn, it's something I had to face.

955
00:44:07,644 --> 00:44:13,668
So seeing humans in their dino game is somehow offensive to some Primal Rage fans.

956
00:44:14,289 --> 00:44:17,951
I mean, I get it, I love the beasts too, but they are still in the game, and this game

957
00:44:17,971 --> 00:44:19,712
wouldn't have been made at all without the humans.

958
00:44:20,273 --> 00:44:24,115
So if new players are able to pick up the game, and they can do it easily because they

959
00:44:24,135 --> 00:44:28,198
have familiar humanoid characters, I still feel that we're justified in the decision

960
00:44:28,218 --> 00:44:29,639
to include the humans even now.

961
00:44:31,716 --> 00:44:34,578
Players often comment positively about the impressive animation.

962
00:44:35,138 --> 00:44:38,040
I appreciate the aspect of this project more and more now,

963
00:44:38,821 --> 00:44:40,222
as the animation makes the game unique,

964
00:44:40,402 --> 00:44:42,483
and it's helped it to age visually very well

965
00:44:42,883 --> 00:44:44,445
when other games of the era have not.

966
00:44:45,966 --> 00:44:47,707
I remember this game as a broken, terrible mess.

967
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:50,248
The new players playing the game were saying

968
00:44:50,288 --> 00:44:51,609
how complete and polished it felt,

969
00:44:51,649 --> 00:44:53,190
despite being an incomplete prototype.

970
00:44:53,911 --> 00:44:56,032
I still think it's a bag of horrors in that regard,

971
00:44:56,072 --> 00:44:58,734
because it never went through any balance testing whatsoever.

972
00:44:59,134 --> 00:45:00,335
It was just my best guesses.

973
00:45:01,233 --> 00:45:05,176
But then they'll say how it was more complete and finished than Street Fighter V, and then

974
00:45:05,217 --> 00:45:06,157
I gotta high-five them.

975
00:45:10,361 --> 00:45:14,065
One thing I do get smug about is how people say the gameplay is so much better than Primal

976
00:45:14,105 --> 00:45:14,285
Rage 1.

977
00:45:14,425 --> 00:45:18,509
I never remind myself that's how I tried to get Primal Rage 1 to play and I wasn't allowed

978
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:19,830
to and then I get sad again.

979
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:21,451
So nothing's really changed there.

980
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:27,812
In the 20 or so years of fighting game evolution and the rise of eSports, people who know their

981
00:45:27,852 --> 00:45:32,914
stuff discuss Primal Rage 2 using modern fighting game design terminologies and dissect it as

982
00:45:32,974 --> 00:45:33,754
if it were made today.

983
00:45:34,394 --> 00:45:38,256
I feel so vindicated when those players say that Primal Rage 2 still holds up as a well-made,

984
00:45:38,316 --> 00:45:41,757
fun fighting game, and that's one of the key things that changed how I felt about the project

985
00:45:42,057 --> 00:45:43,518
and why I can look at it positively now.

986
00:45:45,007 --> 00:45:46,868
So what can we learn about all that's happened here?

987
00:45:47,268 --> 00:45:48,429
Let's take a look at what I learned,

988
00:45:48,469 --> 00:45:50,170
and maybe that can apply to other situations.

989
00:45:50,911 --> 00:45:53,512
So having an impressive, polished, vertical slice

990
00:45:54,233 --> 00:45:55,594
as early as possible is a must.

991
00:45:56,114 --> 00:45:58,135
Looking and being viable is really the best defense

992
00:45:58,175 --> 00:45:59,836
against cancellation, and not always a good place

993
00:45:59,856 --> 00:46:00,857
to be at in your project.

994
00:46:01,237 --> 00:46:02,658
If you have a piece of your game that's playable,

995
00:46:02,698 --> 00:46:05,080
fun, and cool, it increases everybody's morale,

996
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:06,961
and arms you with something that you show off

997
00:46:07,001 --> 00:46:08,462
and be confident about, even in the face

998
00:46:08,482 --> 00:46:09,963
of someone above you who makes decisions.

999
00:46:11,017 --> 00:46:13,819
I should have taken what was going on in the company buyout more seriously.

1000
00:46:14,379 --> 00:46:17,962
Even though I wasn't in the immediate layoffs, the shockwaves caused major disruptions and

1001
00:46:18,002 --> 00:46:18,602
morale loss.

1002
00:46:19,063 --> 00:46:22,945
To this day, I believe that if the company wasn't sold off, Primal Rage 2 would have

1003
00:46:22,965 --> 00:46:23,465
been released.

1004
00:46:24,106 --> 00:46:27,488
But, you know, after all is said and done, I think I'm kind of okay with how things played

1005
00:46:27,528 --> 00:46:27,928
out in the end.

1006
00:46:29,388 --> 00:46:31,650
I wish I had been more appreciative and encouraging of my teammates.

1007
00:46:32,110 --> 00:46:35,793
There are things that happened since the cancellation that helped me heal now, but I'm not so sure

1008
00:46:35,813 --> 00:46:39,776
about the others on the project, whether they know or care, especially since some of those

1009
00:46:39,816 --> 00:46:44,860
like our main stop-motion animator, Pete Kleinow, had passed pretty soon after the project was

1010
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:45,140
over.

1011
00:46:45,861 --> 00:46:50,584
I wish there was a way that I could bring the reassurance I have now back in time to

1012
00:46:50,624 --> 00:46:54,047
make the work more of a joy to those involved, no matter what the outcome would have been.

1013
00:46:55,277 --> 00:46:56,678
I did what I could, but it's never enough.

1014
00:46:56,958 --> 00:46:58,379
You can never preserve enough history.

1015
00:46:58,779 --> 00:47:02,361
If something's certain to be trashed, if you're not there to protect it anymore, try to save

1016
00:47:02,401 --> 00:47:02,461
it.

1017
00:47:02,881 --> 00:47:06,963
If you can't take it with you, take a picture, make a record, tell someone who can protect

1018
00:47:06,983 --> 00:47:07,483
it or save it.

1019
00:47:07,963 --> 00:47:10,404
Company buyouts and closures need to be done more responsibly.

1020
00:47:10,724 --> 00:47:14,466
Maybe more steps need to be taken so digital history can be preserved by those that can

1021
00:47:14,486 --> 00:47:17,708
do something about it, before it's all thrown in a dumpster to be never seen again.

1022
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:22,271
I especially didn't take enough photos of the project, and especially people.

1023
00:47:22,651 --> 00:47:26,012
Digital cameras weren't a thing yet, so that's an excuse, but it's still not an excuse.

1024
00:47:26,672 --> 00:47:31,434
The random motion capture videos that you saw here are absolutely precious to me, and

1025
00:47:31,454 --> 00:47:33,235
are one of the key pieces of history that I have.

1026
00:47:33,715 --> 00:47:37,436
The reactions to those little bits that I've shown of it have had a huge response from

1027
00:47:37,476 --> 00:47:40,217
fans and allow a better story of our development to be told.

1028
00:47:40,957 --> 00:47:43,799
Also getting to see my friends and co-workers and the building I used to call home.

1029
00:47:44,259 --> 00:47:44,839
That's priceless.

1030
00:47:46,007 --> 00:47:48,689
I regret not checking in and keeping ties with my remaining coworkers.

1031
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:51,892
I think more preservation would have been possible had I been better about this.

1032
00:47:53,154 --> 00:47:56,116
Also, huge regrets not going back for my Primal Rage 2 machine.

1033
00:47:56,857 --> 00:48:01,381
I think that failure on that end multiplied my negativity about the game due to the added

1034
00:48:01,401 --> 00:48:03,884
loss and the fact that the company closed so soon after.

1035
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:09,832
I realized I had shut out a lot of the pain in order to move on and in order to survive,

1036
00:48:10,073 --> 00:48:11,654
but you can only do that for so long.

1037
00:48:12,174 --> 00:48:16,457
Sometimes you have to go back and fight your demons or make amends to have a better closure.

1038
00:48:16,917 --> 00:48:21,059
It's not always possible, and sometimes crazy stuff has to happen first, but once you actually

1039
00:48:21,099 --> 00:48:23,401
get over things in a positive way, you'll be better for it.

1040
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:27,832
So what went right, and what am I glad that I did,

1041
00:48:28,052 --> 00:48:29,592
and what would I do again if I had the chance?

1042
00:48:30,233 --> 00:48:32,834
Maintaining my work ethic, even when all seemed lost,

1043
00:48:32,934 --> 00:48:34,255
even if others told me not to.

1044
00:48:34,555 --> 00:48:36,676
This was a happy coincidence in that I was so young

1045
00:48:36,716 --> 00:48:39,197
and motivated and that everything mattered so much to me.

1046
00:48:39,697 --> 00:48:40,638
I really knew no other way,

1047
00:48:40,738 --> 00:48:43,119
and that's just pretty much stayed the same ever since.

1048
00:48:43,739 --> 00:48:45,880
A lot of the quality of the gameplay came from best guesses

1049
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,661
and long, lonely hours to do it,

1050
00:48:47,941 --> 00:48:49,582
since the game never actually went into full test

1051
00:48:49,622 --> 00:48:50,863
or preliminary balancing.

1052
00:48:51,363 --> 00:48:52,283
So always do your best

1053
00:48:52,323 --> 00:48:53,544
and there won't be a chance for regret.

1054
00:48:54,732 --> 00:48:58,696
Releasing pieces of Primal Rage 2 in the form of toys, comics, books, etc.

1055
00:48:59,016 --> 00:49:00,177
A trail for fans to follow.

1056
00:49:01,318 --> 00:49:04,620
If there's enough pieces of the game out there to generate interest and make people look

1057
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:09,465
for answers years later, those people may help to revive or maybe even rebuild your

1058
00:49:09,485 --> 00:49:10,906
cancelled game at some point in the future.

1059
00:49:12,247 --> 00:49:13,068
Preserving what I could.

1060
00:49:13,168 --> 00:49:14,249
Documents, art, and data.

1061
00:49:14,509 --> 00:49:15,149
Glad I did that.

1062
00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:16,991
Something may be important someday.

1063
00:49:18,172 --> 00:49:20,173
So a tip for you time travelers out there.

1064
00:49:20,634 --> 00:49:22,676
Time to get a 20MB mailbox off of a...

1065
00:49:24,523 --> 00:49:29,986
Any kind of large file off of a computer from the early 90s prior to the invention of USB

1066
00:49:30,266 --> 00:49:31,287
is no trivial task.

1067
00:49:31,707 --> 00:49:32,228
Be prepared.

1068
00:49:33,899 --> 00:49:39,102
Reaching out and being encouraging of your fans and projects by establishing a friendly

1069
00:49:39,122 --> 00:49:40,903
and positive dialogue with your fan community.

1070
00:49:41,284 --> 00:49:44,506
They understand the hard work that went into these games and have knowledge and respect

1071
00:49:44,546 --> 00:49:44,806
for it.

1072
00:49:45,146 --> 00:49:49,809
By appreciating their efforts, whether it's making YouTube videos or working on emulators

1073
00:49:49,829 --> 00:49:54,532
or things of that nature, it can drive forward a future for a product that might not otherwise

1074
00:49:54,572 --> 00:49:54,992
have one.

1075
00:49:56,989 --> 00:50:01,633
What else is, the YouTube revolution absolutely made what happened with Primal Rage 2's emulation

1076
00:50:01,673 --> 00:50:02,054
possible.

1077
00:50:02,674 --> 00:50:03,535
It's where it all happened.

1078
00:50:04,035 --> 00:50:07,939
A dialogue was started, and then findings were posted, and it got people excited, and

1079
00:50:07,959 --> 00:50:08,799
efforts were encouraged.

1080
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:11,101
Community motivation is a powerful tool.

1081
00:50:11,502 --> 00:50:15,525
Even my interactions there have had a positive effect, whether they were intentional or not.

1082
00:50:16,686 --> 00:50:20,409
And I can't say how amazing the Galloping Ghost arcade is, for them to invest so much

1083
00:50:20,489 --> 00:50:24,653
effort into restoring games and providing a place where people can play rare and unreleased

1084
00:50:24,713 --> 00:50:24,953
works.

1085
00:50:25,979 --> 00:50:27,641
But there are many organizations like this,

1086
00:50:27,721 --> 00:50:30,424
whether it's an arcade, a museum, a yearly convention,

1087
00:50:30,644 --> 00:50:31,485
or events that host them.

1088
00:50:31,505 --> 00:50:34,149
These are invaluable resources for players and developers.

1089
00:50:34,429 --> 00:50:36,431
So even if they aren't helping to preserve or revive

1090
00:50:36,471 --> 00:50:38,814
your works, considering contributing to their efforts

1091
00:50:39,115 --> 00:50:40,396
so they may continue operating.

1092
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:43,591
Finally, some of us are in here in this room today

1093
00:50:43,631 --> 00:50:45,272
to find out about gaming history and learn from it.

1094
00:50:45,772 --> 00:50:47,754
For that to happen, knowledge has to be shared.

1095
00:50:48,194 --> 00:50:49,294
And this is especially important

1096
00:50:49,474 --> 00:50:51,175
for canceled games and endangered knowledge.

1097
00:50:51,636 --> 00:50:53,937
This is why I love GDC and have been attending for so long

1098
00:50:53,997 --> 00:50:55,518
and I'm happy to finally be able to give back

1099
00:50:55,538 --> 00:50:56,238
a little bit of that.

1100
00:50:56,598 --> 00:50:58,519
So if you have a story, whether you share it

1101
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:00,260
with other professionals or fans of your work,

1102
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,421
someone may learn something or become inspired too.

1103
00:51:04,366 --> 00:51:06,808
So project cancellations are usually stuck in past tense,

1104
00:51:06,868 --> 00:51:08,449
something bad that can't be changed,

1105
00:51:08,869 --> 00:51:10,470
work wasted that will never be seen.

1106
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:12,511
But this story ends a bit differently,

1107
00:51:12,872 --> 00:51:15,033
and I've made a video that shows some personal resolution

1108
00:51:15,073 --> 00:51:17,014
as a result of Primal Rage 2's revivals

1109
00:51:17,354 --> 00:51:19,116
and how it ties into the present and the future.

1110
00:51:24,699 --> 00:51:27,561
A witcher versus the beast of Mechina!

1111
00:51:28,162 --> 00:51:31,003
Killer instinct versus Primal Rage!

1112
00:51:32,088 --> 00:51:40,412
So I didn't work on The Witcher 3, but I thought this reference to Primal Rage, clearly in the context of 1994 since it also mentions Killer Instinct, was really interesting.

1113
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:42,093
It made me think.

1114
00:51:43,634 --> 00:51:48,116
All these years and I had shoved Primal Rage games so far back into my mind that I never did anything like this.

1115
00:51:48,596 --> 00:51:50,737
I never connected what I did later to what I did before.

1116
00:51:51,118 --> 00:51:53,539
Kind of like a lost opportunity, so maybe I should change that.

1117
00:51:54,859 --> 00:51:57,581
Because eventually, I did get over my shame.

1118
00:51:58,161 --> 00:51:59,242
I learned to be proud of my work.

1119
00:52:02,042 --> 00:52:06,863
I learned to be proud of my work, and why is it showing my PowerPoint on the video?

1120
00:52:09,104 --> 00:52:11,565
Hold on a second, okay.

1121
00:52:11,585 --> 00:52:13,525
So all these years, and I finally got over my shame.

1122
00:52:13,625 --> 00:52:15,346
I learned to be proud of my work, canceled or not.

1123
00:52:15,926 --> 00:52:19,467
And now maybe I don't mind mentioning Primal Rage every now and then, even here in this

1124
00:52:19,527 --> 00:52:20,788
last project I did something on.

1125
00:52:21,108 --> 00:52:23,168
Because, you know, it's a prehistoric level and it kind of fits.

1126
00:52:26,142 --> 00:52:27,783
So I go back to the Galloping Ghosts Arcade

1127
00:52:27,823 --> 00:52:29,545
every now and then, every year,

1128
00:52:29,825 --> 00:52:30,786
thankful for their efforts.

1129
00:52:30,806 --> 00:52:33,027
I was able to donate some cool Primal Rage stuff

1130
00:52:33,047 --> 00:52:34,989
to their living museum of all things Primal Rage.

1131
00:52:35,589 --> 00:52:37,730
Their prototypes didn't have a bezel and control panel

1132
00:52:37,771 --> 00:52:39,432
as the game got canceled while I was working on them.

1133
00:52:39,912 --> 00:52:42,154
So now I'm working with the arcade to get them done,

1134
00:52:42,414 --> 00:52:44,635
assembling art and other lost resources I've since found

1135
00:52:45,096 --> 00:52:47,297
to finish the cabinet and make their machine truly complete.

1136
00:52:48,018 --> 00:52:48,738
But that's not all.

1137
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:53,141
It turns out they were interested in what I was doing next.

1138
00:52:56,483 --> 00:53:00,766
My current game project, the tentatively titled Strike Harbinger, was first unveiled at the

1139
00:53:00,786 --> 00:53:01,826
Galloping Ghost Arcade.

1140
00:53:02,687 --> 00:53:05,088
They will be helping us to produce the eventual arcade version.

1141
00:53:05,969 --> 00:53:09,911
All three leads in our team, including myself, are ex-Atari Games creators.

1142
00:53:10,892 --> 00:53:14,754
And with that, we want to carry on the hopes and dreams of where we once came from.

1143
00:53:15,674 --> 00:53:20,077
As bizarre as it sounds, my current team and project might not be where we are today.

1144
00:53:21,190 --> 00:53:24,932
had Primal Rage 2 not been cancelled. And despite the hardships along the way,

1145
00:53:25,153 --> 00:53:26,713
it led to many other things that were good.

1146
00:53:28,454 --> 00:53:30,776
Maybe Primal Rage 2 will be a part of everything I do now.

1147
00:53:37,319 --> 00:53:44,743
And maybe this bone dragon boss came from out of an asteroid egg. Or maybe it didn't.

1148
00:53:50,325 --> 00:53:51,766
So that might have been the end of the story,

1149
00:53:52,307 --> 00:53:53,787
but this story kept writing itself

1150
00:53:53,867 --> 00:53:56,749
even after my talk got accepted at GDC.

1151
00:53:59,891 --> 00:54:01,592
So now you get the special surprise ending.

1152
00:54:04,534 --> 00:54:07,035
At the end of 2017, YouTube user GreenGeode,

1153
00:54:07,255 --> 00:54:08,876
who was on the forefront of research efforts

1154
00:54:08,916 --> 00:54:10,317
regarding PrimalRage 2's data

1155
00:54:10,337 --> 00:54:11,378
and the inner workings of the game,

1156
00:54:11,598 --> 00:54:12,499
posted this video.

1157
00:54:12,879 --> 00:54:14,980
I did not ask him to make this, nor did I contact him.

1158
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,401
And I'm gonna have to quote myself.

1159
00:54:18,610 --> 00:54:23,396
I can tell this was not representative of how far we came because Talon's slide is still

1160
00:54:23,476 --> 00:54:25,239
super broken and it really bugs me.

1161
00:54:25,759 --> 00:54:29,324
The crazy slide can be fun in a broken state, but it makes the whole game look unfinished.

1162
00:54:29,344 --> 00:54:29,404
LOL.

1163
00:54:36,117 --> 00:54:39,119
So it seems that there's still a desire to see Primal Rage 2 completed someday,

1164
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:44,563
and what you see here are the very first efforts towards continued development of Primal Rage 2 going into the future,

1165
00:54:44,843 --> 00:54:50,848
by way of patching the game with various fixes, which someday may even be used to update the arcade machine at Galloping Ghost.

1166
00:54:51,368 --> 00:54:54,130
The only thing that's going to get cancelled now is the apocalypse.

1167
00:54:55,205 --> 00:55:00,030
Someone noticing my conversation on YouTube resulted in a bug fix for a two decade old game,

1168
00:55:00,311 --> 00:55:04,515
so you never know what good it can do to share a bit of history and to discuss your stories too.

1169
00:55:05,116 --> 00:55:08,899
I look forward to further interactions with these passionate fans, at least in an advisory role,

1170
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:12,123
to maybe see it get closer to where it would have been had it not been cancelled.

1171
00:55:15,303 --> 00:55:18,625
I feel fortunate that by twists of fate, one of the most devastating things that happened

1172
00:55:18,645 --> 00:55:21,167
in my life was eventually turned into something positive.

1173
00:55:21,567 --> 00:55:23,668
Cancellation did not have to mean non-existence.

1174
00:55:24,089 --> 00:55:28,111
I can only hope that others of you with a cancelled project or bought out company

1175
00:55:28,719 --> 00:55:30,420
may also find a way towards a better outcome.

1176
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:32,160
Sometimes you can't fight fate,

1177
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:33,381
but you can roll with the punches

1178
00:55:33,461 --> 00:55:34,741
and make the best of a situation.

1179
00:55:35,161 --> 00:55:37,622
It may take years, or in my case decades,

1180
00:55:37,862 --> 00:55:38,802
but never give up hope.

1181
00:55:39,222 --> 00:55:41,103
Learn from your experiences, good or bad,

1182
00:55:41,443 --> 00:55:43,104
project released or project canceled.

1183
00:55:43,484 --> 00:55:45,024
A win quote I wrote for the character of Ryu

1184
00:55:45,064 --> 00:55:46,645
in Street Fighter sums it up quite nicely.

1185
00:55:47,805 --> 00:55:48,785
Whether we win or lose,

1186
00:55:49,085 --> 00:55:50,406
all of our battles make us stronger.

1187
00:55:51,376 --> 00:55:54,239
Here's some contact info and resources if you want to find out more about what's going

1188
00:55:54,279 --> 00:55:57,764
on with Primal Rage 2 going into the future, or for myself for that matter.

1189
00:55:58,264 --> 00:56:01,668
Please support these Primal Rage 2 YouTubers, this story wouldn't have been possible without

1190
00:56:01,708 --> 00:56:01,868
them.

1191
00:56:02,209 --> 00:56:04,932
And if there's time I can take questions, so please approach the microphone.

1192
00:56:12,726 --> 00:56:14,727
Hi, this is more of a comment than a question.

1193
00:56:14,827 --> 00:56:18,208
So going back about 17 years now,

1194
00:56:19,228 --> 00:56:23,830
I've been preserving unreleased games over the internet.

1195
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:27,751
And it's involved about five figures

1196
00:56:27,891 --> 00:56:29,131
of lost money on my part.

1197
00:56:29,191 --> 00:56:31,332
It's involved fighting a lot of collectors

1198
00:56:31,372 --> 00:56:32,833
who wanna like hoard these things away

1199
00:56:32,853 --> 00:56:34,553
in their like goblin treasure hoards.

1200
00:56:35,113 --> 00:56:38,634
And it's involved a lot of like kind of stalkery emails

1201
00:56:38,674 --> 00:56:40,275
to developers and things like that.

1202
00:56:42,443 --> 00:56:48,644
to see this talk at GDC has been just really gratifying for my work over all these years.

1203
00:56:48,664 --> 00:56:51,965
I'm really happy to hear it. There are people that hoard this stuff, but then there's also

1204
00:56:52,305 --> 00:56:55,226
people like Galloping Ghosts who actually want to put them out for people to play, and I think

1205
00:56:55,266 --> 00:56:58,446
that's great. A place like that can live, and the games get to live too.

1206
00:56:58,907 --> 00:57:00,807
So I just wanted to thank you.

1207
00:57:00,847 --> 00:57:01,287
Oh, thank you.

1208
00:57:01,327 --> 00:57:02,627
It's kind of an emotional moment for me.

1209
00:57:02,667 --> 00:57:05,128
And thank you for any efforts that you do to preserve games.

1210
00:57:05,328 --> 00:57:09,069
I didn't have anything to do with this one, but there's a lot of others. Thank you very much.

1211
00:57:09,409 --> 00:57:09,789
You're welcome.

1212
00:57:13,691 --> 00:57:16,454
Hi, uh, given the resurgence that Primal Rage 2 had on the

1213
00:57:16,474 --> 00:57:19,356
internet, is, do you think there's any possibility of

1214
00:57:19,797 --> 00:57:21,138
future installments in the series?

1215
00:57:21,478 --> 00:57:24,000
So I get, I get asked that a lot. A lot of it has to do with

1216
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:26,703
who owns the IP now, which is probably, uh, Warner Brothers,

1217
00:57:26,823 --> 00:57:29,025
because they bought everything that Atari Games had for a

1218
00:57:29,045 --> 00:57:31,567
while, they brought out a version of Gauntlet. Um, if they

1219
00:57:31,587 --> 00:57:33,509
want to do an official one, then they would have to find a

1220
00:57:33,529 --> 00:57:34,370
developer and do it.

1221
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:38,093
if they wanted to reach out to me, I'm busy right now, but I can advise them.

1222
00:57:39,374 --> 00:57:41,616
There has been some interest. A lot of fans contact me and

1223
00:57:42,176 --> 00:57:45,279
I've been kinda like thinking, well, what would a spiritual successor be like?

1224
00:57:45,779 --> 00:57:48,682
So, you know, if the IP goes up for sale again,

1225
00:57:48,702 --> 00:57:52,445
I might, you know, take a look at that. So that might be official, but otherwise

1226
00:57:52,505 --> 00:57:54,827
Werner Brothers is kind of in their hands as they own it now.

1227
00:57:56,108 --> 00:57:57,189
Thank you. You're welcome.

1228
00:58:02,493 --> 00:58:03,094
Any other questions?

1229
00:58:07,139 --> 00:58:07,399
Okay.

1230
00:58:10,146 --> 00:58:14,457
Have you been in contact with any of the sort of dumpster divery Atari collectors who might

1231
00:58:14,497 --> 00:58:16,783
have assets that you're missing for this game?

1232
00:58:17,797 --> 00:58:23,822
Hmm. Um, I'm in contact with some people that do have a lot of the Atari stuff. Um, actually

1233
00:58:23,842 --> 00:58:27,844
the owner of AtariGames.com has a lot of the stuff and he has been doing some things to

1234
00:58:27,884 --> 00:58:31,467
preserve it. He's been sharing his photos. Uh, some of the photos were actually, uh, from

1235
00:58:31,527 --> 00:58:34,629
ones that he had posted. Uh, so they're, they're out there. Um.

1236
00:58:34,949 --> 00:58:37,231
Cool. I don't need to introduce you then. That's why I was asking.

1237
00:58:37,351 --> 00:58:39,873
Okay. Yeah. I, I know Scott. Oh perfect. Yeah.

1238
00:58:40,153 --> 00:58:45,817
Okay. Yeah, he's the one who, um, I, I put the flyer up on his machine. Yeah.

1239
00:58:48,329 --> 00:58:55,442
Oh nice. See it all it all works out. Thanks. If there's any uh no other questions uh y'all can

1240
00:58:55,482 --> 00:58:57,485
come up here and grab a card if you want.
