00:00:00,129 --> 00:00:04,992
Good morning, if you are in, uh, everywhere but the East Coast of America.

2
00:00:05,072 --> 00:00:06,813
Good afternoon, if you're on the East Coast.

3
00:00:06,873 --> 00:00:08,894
Good afternoon, or good evening, if you're in Europe.

4
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:13,977
Um, uh, good morning, I guess, if you're in Hawaii?

5
00:00:14,417 --> 00:00:15,798
If you're in Hawaii, it's early for you.

6
00:00:16,339 --> 00:00:20,760
My name is Brian Francis. I am a contributing editor at GammaStriger.com.

7
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,541
I am a community manager with GDC.

8
00:00:22,921 --> 00:00:27,762
I am your host, your invisible voice who hangs out here and plays video games with you.

9
00:00:28,302 --> 00:00:29,723
I'm going to give a quick shout out in chat.

10
00:00:29,743 --> 00:00:31,384
Looks like we got some few folks in here already.

11
00:00:31,424 --> 00:00:35,845
We got Keithulu and Kanakero.

12
00:00:36,925 --> 00:00:38,246
Thank you both for joining us.

13
00:00:39,766 --> 00:00:42,867
What we are here today doing, what we're here today playing,

14
00:00:42,887 --> 00:00:44,248
we're here playing Nowhere Prophet.

15
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:49,714
We are talking to Martin Nerukar, who is down in the lower left hand corner of your screen.

16
00:00:50,455 --> 00:00:51,336
Martin, how are you doing?

17
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:56,122
I'm doing fine. It's very warm, as you can see from my choice in the tower.

18
00:00:56,322 --> 00:00:56,562
Yeah.

19
00:00:57,043 --> 00:00:59,626
But it's getting colder. It's the evening.

20
00:01:00,184 --> 00:01:08,169
I can see on your shirt there, you're wearing a GDC shirt from like 2011?

21
00:01:08,209 --> 00:01:09,691
Because it's GDC 2011?

22
00:01:09,731 --> 00:01:09,911
Yeah.

23
00:01:09,991 --> 00:01:10,631
Yeah.

24
00:01:11,632 --> 00:01:15,955
And then Alyssa, Gamasutra Master of Words, how are you doing?

25
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:18,197
I'm very sleepy, but I am here.

26
00:01:18,237 --> 00:01:18,657
Hello.

27
00:01:19,098 --> 00:01:19,298
Yeah.

28
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:20,158
It's the tired...

29
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:22,880
Today we are tired developers conference.

30
00:01:24,441 --> 00:01:27,244
Yeah, I got out of bed very late today as well, so I can...

31
00:01:27,564 --> 00:01:27,944
I feel it.

32
00:01:28,446 --> 00:01:31,891
Yeah, we're gonna do our best to power through that. Thank you all for joining us.

33
00:01:32,391 --> 00:01:39,761
Like I said, we're here to say thank you to Nowhere Profit. It is a science fiction, kind of card based RPG?

34
00:01:40,001 --> 00:01:43,526
I guess you can call it an RPG. Strategy, it's kind of a strategy game more than that.

35
00:01:44,507 --> 00:01:50,291
So it's a mix of kind of a, you're about to see it, it is a, well you might be about to see it, I don't know what's going to happen when I go to these crossroads.

36
00:01:50,952 --> 00:01:57,596
It is kind of a mix of card playing elements with this Oregon Trail slash FTL kind of narrative interludes.

37
00:01:58,197 --> 00:02:03,360
And Martin here is the lead developer at Shark Bomb, the company that brought us the game.

38
00:02:04,361 --> 00:02:11,086
Martin, while I get started on my first part of my Legolas adventure, would you mind explaining the origins of Nowhere Prophet?

39
00:02:12,227 --> 00:02:17,055
Oh god, so no I don't, but it's difficult.

40
00:02:17,115 --> 00:02:21,942
So I kind of started with the first prototypes for what would eventually become No More Profit

41
00:02:22,062 --> 00:02:25,027
back in 2014, like over 5 years ago at this point.

42
00:02:26,445 --> 00:02:33,929
I was basically looking for an abstract conflict resolution system that could manage actual

43
00:02:33,949 --> 00:02:38,071
physical fights and social situations as well.

44
00:02:38,431 --> 00:02:42,373
Because I really liked stuff like in Mass Effect, towards the end of the game you can

45
00:02:42,393 --> 00:02:48,335
sort of convince, I think Saren was his name, from not attacking you, and he instead kills

46
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:49,756
himself but then you still have a boss fight.

47
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:53,818
But I liked the idea of going through the world and winning with words instead of with

48
00:02:54,038 --> 00:02:54,358
weapons.

49
00:02:54,999 --> 00:03:04,021
So I looked at sort of abstract conflict resolution mechanics, and the first ones I sort of played around with were timing based, because I needed something that is not like shooter thing.

50
00:03:04,121 --> 00:03:12,463
I, like, thinking of a shooter and then making that map to sort of talking doesn't work for me. So I went in and started with some timing mechanics and then sort of moved to cards.

51
00:03:14,063 --> 00:03:19,845
And from there, ended up with like a card system that I really liked, which is, in fact, really different from what we have now.

52
00:03:21,152 --> 00:03:22,933
And then sort of built the game around it.

53
00:03:23,754 --> 00:03:28,678
And the world sort of came from me looking into my background.

54
00:03:28,718 --> 00:03:30,639
So I'm half German, half Indian.

55
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:33,601
So that's sort of where the Indian inspiration comes from.

56
00:03:33,621 --> 00:03:37,925
And I always really like post-apocalypse, but I was bored with sort of the...

57
00:03:39,568 --> 00:03:42,812
I'm just going to say white dudes in leather jackets in brown worlds.

58
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:48,399
So I tried to sort of mix it up with sort of a different aesthetic and sort of have more colors in there.

59
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:54,606
More colorful people, more colorful sort of a strange planet with like purple sky stuff and different moons.

60
00:03:55,428 --> 00:03:58,471
That was sort of where it came from sort of initially.

61
00:03:59,045 --> 00:04:02,907
Which is funny, because I recently looked at Griftlands, I think the alpha or the beta,

62
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:12,153
which is the play card game, and they have this sort of two-pronged social and physical combat thing,

63
00:04:13,074 --> 00:04:16,756
which I had to scrap because when I was working on the game it was still the old system.

64
00:04:17,377 --> 00:04:23,621
It was just too much work for me because you mentioned the developer, like there's nobody else here but me.

65
00:04:24,811 --> 00:04:32,856
It's not like a big team, so I had to scrap the social comment because it was just too much to deal with two entire different decks and everything.

66
00:04:33,537 --> 00:04:36,058
Which was a shame, but the right choice in hindsight.

67
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:57,444
Funny thing, a bunch of the... that guy that's just dying now, that you just lost forever, is Anjin.

68
00:04:58,285 --> 00:05:05,230
He's the art director of the game. So there's like, we made portraits of a bunch of the people that worked on the game and I got them involved.

69
00:05:06,911 --> 00:05:08,172
Now he's gone, Brian, way to go!

70
00:05:09,714 --> 00:05:14,437
I mean, now that sounds like a contradiction of sort of saying it's only me and then I'm saying that's an art director.

71
00:05:15,258 --> 00:05:21,402
Basically, sort of to explain before anybody's confused is that I'm sort of the only full-time developer on the game.

72
00:05:21,462 --> 00:05:32,409
I did all the design, I did 99% of the code, I did a lot of the writing, I did all the interface design, and I did a lot of the art direction as well.

73
00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:38,353
We did this sort of as a two-man team. But I didn't do the pretty pictures, I did very few of the sound effects, and I did none of the music.

74
00:05:39,675 --> 00:05:42,736
So that's all thanks to very talented people that you can see in the credits.

75
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:45,838
Right on.

76
00:05:46,178 --> 00:05:50,181
Uh, to, to, um, continue, uh, the line of questioning.

77
00:05:50,261 --> 00:05:54,103
So once you, you, you sort of migrated from, you said you had wanted to do

78
00:05:54,143 --> 00:05:58,525
conflict resolution in a way that wasn't, uh, um, that wasn't combat based, that

79
00:05:58,565 --> 00:06:01,587
wasn't shooting, that wasn't sort of moving and dodging, what made you move

80
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:05,189
towards a kind of this like adventure, like trekking across the landscape while

81
00:06:05,249 --> 00:06:09,272
managing a, a convoy of nomads kind of take?

82
00:06:09,877 --> 00:06:12,118
I mean that's always where it started on.

83
00:06:12,278 --> 00:06:16,019
Like I had the general conflict system and I wanted to put something around it.

84
00:06:16,119 --> 00:06:22,703
And I wanted to have a story about a bunch of people and not just this one hero that

85
00:06:22,743 --> 00:06:24,884
goes and does everything by himself.

86
00:06:26,884 --> 00:06:33,466
The early combat system I had, which eventually got scrapped, was a lot more sort of party-based.

87
00:06:33,766 --> 00:06:37,427
Like you had a bunch of sort of special people each at their own small decks,

88
00:06:37,627 --> 00:06:41,148
and you sort of had this one-on-one, sort of three-versus-three party fights going on.

89
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:46,090
And, I don't know, I always liked sort of stories about community.

90
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:49,851
Banner Saga really spoke to me, sort of, from the narrative it kind of had.

91
00:06:50,431 --> 00:06:54,873
And I kind of wanted to do something that's not, as I said, not about like the lone hero.

92
00:06:57,761 --> 00:07:03,184
What were some of the other game design choices you felt like reinforced that decision as opposed to

93
00:07:04,404 --> 00:07:05,985
that and when did you sort of like

94
00:07:06,865 --> 00:07:09,387
Realize you were wandering off course and needed to get back to that

95
00:07:11,577 --> 00:07:18,802
So I mean the most important one was the old system was sort of you had a number of followers

96
00:07:18,842 --> 00:07:22,924
which was pretty much just a number, like you had 17 followers, 20 followers, and then

97
00:07:22,944 --> 00:07:28,048
you had these dudes that were sort of your warriors, which would have their own sort

98
00:07:28,068 --> 00:07:30,910
of little decks and you'd, you know, three of yours against three of the enemy.

99
00:07:32,371 --> 00:07:34,352
And I scrapped that because it...

100
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:41,174
While the system itself worked, it was a fun card game that I enjoyed playing and that

101
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:46,198
people enjoyed playing, but it didn't fit the theme enough because all your people in

102
00:07:46,238 --> 00:07:47,479
your convoy were just numbers.

103
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:53,324
So I took a break at that point, I was really unsatisfied with where the game was going.

104
00:07:53,344 --> 00:07:58,948
I could have finished it at that point, but it was just not where I wanted it to be.

105
00:07:58,968 --> 00:08:02,110
And then I just sort of redesigned the entire game.

106
00:08:02,797 --> 00:08:16,163
A combat system which came back and did a sort of extensive paper prototyping to solve some issues I have with the gameplay in sort of a longer term progression, but also to make the convoy matter more.

107
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:21,846
And that's sort of where this idea comes from, that actually the people in your convoy are specific cards.

108
00:08:23,707 --> 00:08:30,931
Which I think the whole cards are people and sort of wounds on cards thing and blessing cards is really sort of...

109
00:08:32,004 --> 00:08:35,793
Very good thing that does wonders for no web profit and sort of for the deck building parts of it.

110
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:42,042
Right on. I am currently learning more about the game.

111
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:45,564
As you can see, I couldn't say a lot of it before getting started.

112
00:08:46,304 --> 00:08:49,726
Okay, I'm going to jump into my question pile for a minute.

113
00:08:53,187 --> 00:08:59,551
Oh man, our co-worker Alex would like to point out that you have very good hair.

114
00:09:00,171 --> 00:09:00,951
Thank you.

115
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,592
Shout out to Alex for watching.

116
00:09:02,692 --> 00:09:05,133
It's been pink for two days now.

117
00:09:05,525 --> 00:09:07,266
Nice. We are also taking questions from chat.

118
00:09:07,826 --> 00:09:09,547
If you've got questions about the Make Game No More profit.

119
00:09:10,128 --> 00:09:13,489
Um, uh, you are, before the stream we were discussing,

120
00:09:13,549 --> 00:09:15,290
you are currently, uh,

121
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,971
sanding off the edges of some of your AI.

122
00:09:16,991 --> 00:09:19,352
We were discussing about how the difficulty spikes are sort of

123
00:09:20,233 --> 00:09:24,094
uh, jumping a little ahead than where you want, where you want them to be.

124
00:09:24,715 --> 00:09:27,496
Um, uh, would you mind talking about the discussion of like,

125
00:09:27,516 --> 00:09:30,718
realizing that you'd be making an AI driven game instead of like a, you know, card.

126
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:33,179
I think of a card game, I think of Magic, I think of Pokemon,

127
00:09:33,219 --> 00:09:34,640
I think of something I play with another person.

128
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:45,023
What was that process like for figuring out your games once you realized you had to be an AI programmer as well as a game designer?

129
00:09:45,404 --> 00:09:46,284
How is that going?

130
00:09:47,564 --> 00:09:51,946
The reason for the game being a single player game is because I really love card games.

131
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:56,388
I actually currently still play a lot of Magic the Gathering.

132
00:09:57,008 --> 00:10:00,249
I got back into it almost a year ago at this point.

133
00:10:00,709 --> 00:10:01,330
I played 25 years ago.

134
00:10:03,361 --> 00:10:04,901
It's like a teenager in high school.

135
00:10:06,062 --> 00:10:07,062
And I'm getting back into it.

136
00:10:07,082 --> 00:10:09,703
And I really love playing physical card games with people,

137
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:11,703
because you have your local meta,

138
00:10:12,783 --> 00:10:13,824
and you know you play people,

139
00:10:13,884 --> 00:10:15,424
and you can play in a relaxed manner.

140
00:10:15,704 --> 00:10:18,205
You can make fun decks and make interesting choices.

141
00:10:18,765 --> 00:10:20,905
And I played a lot of Hearthstone,

142
00:10:20,945 --> 00:10:22,486
also as research for the game,

143
00:10:22,526 --> 00:10:24,986
but also played a bunch of online card games before.

144
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,787
And the issue for me was always...

145
00:10:28,199 --> 00:10:34,107
If you play online, you suddenly have this sort of very competitive arena that you're in,

146
00:10:34,527 --> 00:10:37,331
which means it's sort of like going to a magic tournament.

147
00:10:37,351 --> 00:10:41,456
To compete, you need to know what the deck builds are, you need to build the perfect deck,

148
00:10:41,476 --> 00:10:45,522
you need to spend money or grind like my hell to get the right cards or be very lucky.

149
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:48,232
And then you have a chance at competing.

150
00:10:48,292 --> 00:10:51,495
And that sort of sucks out the fun of sort of building the deck for me,

151
00:10:51,555 --> 00:10:55,899
because it becomes this know the meta and play to the meta kind of thing.

152
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,861
And I never really wanted to go there.

153
00:10:57,901 --> 00:11:00,623
And I like before I designed No More Prophet, I played Dominion.

154
00:11:00,703 --> 00:11:02,045
I'm not sure if anyone of you knows it.

155
00:11:02,605 --> 00:11:05,188
It's a it's a physical card game that is.

156
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:08,460
sort of the granddaddy of deck building as a concept.

157
00:11:09,401 --> 00:11:11,822
It's a game where you have a bunch of cards, and it's a bunch of cards on the table,

158
00:11:11,902 --> 00:11:15,223
and you have a small deck, which you cycle through constantly.

159
00:11:15,283 --> 00:11:17,845
And you use that deck to sort of buy stuff into your deck,

160
00:11:17,925 --> 00:11:20,426
and you need to buy stuff that allows you to do more things,

161
00:11:20,486 --> 00:11:23,407
but also need to buy victory points, which do nothing for your deck.

162
00:11:23,988 --> 00:11:27,049
So you sort of have this back-and-forth between buying stuff,

163
00:11:27,129 --> 00:11:29,750
or buying stuff before somebody else buys it, or buying victory points.

164
00:11:30,947 --> 00:11:33,330
And it's a really fun challenge of deck building.

165
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:37,774
I know it's pretty old at this point, but when I played it, I sort of got a really new

166
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:42,239
access to sort of the fun of deck building, because I remember thinking back on Magic

167
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:47,164
25 years ago, I always built fun and janky decks, but I sucked at them.

168
00:11:47,525 --> 00:11:48,426
Like, my decks were shit.

169
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,932
because people were building more efficient decks.

170
00:11:51,693 --> 00:11:55,696
And sort of, Dominion, like, I don't know, I guess it's ten years ago or something,

171
00:11:56,477 --> 00:12:00,079
sort of gave me an idea that deck building actually can be very fun if it's not

172
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:04,203
sort of this thing you need to do before, and you need to do your homework and your research,

173
00:12:04,663 --> 00:12:08,346
but if it's part of the game and part of the resources and sort of the challenges

174
00:12:08,746 --> 00:12:10,988
managing the resources right and sort of, you know.

175
00:12:13,131 --> 00:12:15,972
And that's sort of where this comes from. And then sort of talking about the AI,

176
00:12:16,692 --> 00:12:23,974
um, man, building an AI is hard. It's hard because it's super intransparent.

177
00:12:24,614 --> 00:12:31,116
Like, the AI does things and you hope it does things the right way, but man, it's tough.

178
00:12:33,156 --> 00:12:35,557
I mean, my goal for the AI was always...

179
00:12:37,267 --> 00:12:43,449
It doesn't need to be perfect, it doesn't need to compete on a human level because it's a single player game.

180
00:12:43,589 --> 00:12:49,011
It's not like a multiplayer where on an even footing it needs to match you or be boring.

181
00:12:50,472 --> 00:12:54,733
Because the game has this attrition aspect as you play, you lose resources.

182
00:12:54,753 --> 00:12:56,133
So you want to be efficient in your fights.

183
00:12:56,714 --> 00:13:00,415
Which means the AI doesn't need to be superb, but it doesn't need to be stupid.

184
00:13:00,595 --> 00:13:04,636
It should never make mistakes where you go like, what the hell, why are you doing this?

185
00:13:06,136 --> 00:13:13,133
And unfortunately the game launched last weekend with a bug in there, which I just actually like an hour ago fixed.

186
00:13:14,076 --> 00:13:15,359
That made the idea super thin.

187
00:13:16,531 --> 00:13:19,933
I'm going to write up an announcement about that later, but what it boils down to is,

188
00:13:21,755 --> 00:13:25,257
like 6 weeks ago, 7 weeks ago, I went through and optimized the AI to make sure it runs

189
00:13:25,318 --> 00:13:28,040
quicker and faster so it allows me to do more iteration.

190
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:34,565
The AI basically simulates a whole bunch of moves, evaluates those moves, and then picks

191
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:37,447
the best move, and then does the same thing over and over again.

192
00:13:38,385 --> 00:13:43,427
It actually simulates a bunch of moves forward, so if I do this and then this and then this,

193
00:13:43,887 --> 00:13:44,787
how good is the move?

194
00:13:44,847 --> 00:13:48,029
Or if I do this and then this and then this, how good is that?

195
00:13:48,069 --> 00:13:49,890
And then it sort of evaluates the different branches.

196
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:54,651
It's Monte Carlo Tree Search, if anyone's interested in the actual algorithm behind

197
00:13:54,671 --> 00:13:54,712
it.

198
00:13:56,219 --> 00:14:02,223
But there was this little bug in the game where when I optimized it, I wasn't paying a lot of attention.

199
00:14:02,343 --> 00:14:05,426
And so what happened was, when it would do one move, everything was fine.

200
00:14:05,486 --> 00:14:10,390
But when it was doing the second move, there was an error that changed the game state

201
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:14,633
and that would always make this move look like it's more valuable than it was.

202
00:14:14,953 --> 00:14:19,597
And the further down it went, the more valuable the moves became, even though the move might have been shit.

203
00:14:20,017 --> 00:14:23,679
But the deviation from the actual game state became bigger and bigger,

204
00:14:24,179 --> 00:14:27,020
so that it would take moves that weren't useful, just because it thought,

205
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,901
oh, in the end it's going to be really good.

206
00:14:29,842 --> 00:14:34,884
And the issue was I basically had a reference to a list and was filling stuff in that list

207
00:14:34,944 --> 00:14:37,125
instead of copying the list and then filling the list.

208
00:14:38,265 --> 00:14:40,246
Happens. Unfortunately.

209
00:14:41,667 --> 00:14:43,548
But finding that one was a bitch.

210
00:14:45,762 --> 00:14:48,303
Right on. I need to do some inventory management over here.

211
00:14:48,743 --> 00:14:51,704
Alyssa, can I throw the question ball to you?

212
00:14:52,004 --> 00:14:55,725
No problem. You had mentioned, like I said, deck building game.

213
00:14:55,805 --> 00:14:59,926
I love, I relate a lot with what you're saying about Magic because I love playing just like fun decks

214
00:15:00,106 --> 00:15:05,048
and I love deck building, but I'm actually crap at any kind of like competitive element

215
00:15:05,128 --> 00:15:08,469
or like taking it beyond just like having fun with it.

216
00:15:09,049 --> 00:15:11,550
So that kind of like resonated with me when you were talking about deck building before.

217
00:15:12,242 --> 00:15:15,844
And deck building with a roguelike game is actually a super good mix.

218
00:15:16,404 --> 00:15:21,566
And it's just really interesting with how you kind of merge those two elements.

219
00:15:21,586 --> 00:15:26,648
So I was wondering if you could talk about how you kind of fell into the roguelike elements of this game a little bit.

220
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:30,229
Well, I mean, I don't think I fell into them.

221
00:15:30,289 --> 00:15:31,650
It's sort of they were always there.

222
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:34,831
As soon as I had the core gameplay, I knew I kind of wanted to do a single player thing.

223
00:15:34,891 --> 00:15:35,871
I didn't want to do multiplayer.

224
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:43,180
Both for sort of pragmatic reasons like I don't want to build sort of networking code.

225
00:15:43,841 --> 00:15:49,544
Also, you know, as an indie, if you make a multiplayer game and not enough people play, then it's dead in the water.

226
00:15:49,644 --> 00:15:50,805
And it's going to be dead forever.

227
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:55,948
And I didn't really want to go there. I didn't want to run the risk of sort of building something.

228
00:15:56,549 --> 00:15:58,930
And it also felt like it would be bigger than anything I would build.

229
00:15:59,314 --> 00:16:04,878
I would be doing on my own because I knew I was going to do most of this on my own.

230
00:16:05,079 --> 00:16:07,581
Ended up biting off more than I could chew anyway.

231
00:16:07,941 --> 00:16:09,602
This thing is huge, it took five years.

232
00:16:10,663 --> 00:16:12,464
But I'm glad I never picked multiplayer.

233
00:16:12,484 --> 00:16:17,969
And I don't know, the roguelike, I mean, that's sort of the inspiration of FTL, is

234
00:16:17,989 --> 00:16:19,110
sort of obvious from the map.

235
00:16:20,651 --> 00:16:24,634
And that's sort of, we talked about Banner Saga, even though that's not a roguelike,

236
00:16:24,654 --> 00:16:28,217
but I think FTL really sort of gripped me with sort of the replayability.

237
00:16:29,487 --> 00:16:31,548
And I really enjoy procedural generation.

238
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:34,030
So that's kind of where this came in.

239
00:16:34,051 --> 00:16:39,015
I was like, all right, I really like card games, deck-building games, I like roguelikes.

240
00:16:39,255 --> 00:16:41,157
Let's just put them together and make something cool.

241
00:16:42,758 --> 00:16:48,323
Speaking of the map, the map we see currently, which is this very FDL-like map, is...

242
00:16:49,304 --> 00:16:56,911
It's like the process of three months of iteration, of coming up with different versions, of not doing this kind of map, but doing something card-based or something different.

243
00:16:56,931 --> 00:17:04,898
I just iterated away and came up with a lot of interesting ideas, but nothing that really worked for Noble Prophet.

244
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,160
With a card game, it just ended up being too complex.

245
00:17:07,701 --> 00:17:11,064
And I ended up rolling back everything and going with the basic, boring map.

246
00:17:11,985 --> 00:17:13,166
Which, I don't know, still sort of...

247
00:17:13,186 --> 00:17:14,427
Oh, man.

248
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,013
But I mean the map works fine.

249
00:17:17,233 --> 00:17:17,894
Yeah, it works.

250
00:17:18,114 --> 00:17:20,296
And at some point I was just like, fuck, I need to stop iterating.

251
00:17:20,336 --> 00:17:21,758
I need to do the game, make the game.

252
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:23,239
Um, so...

253
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,981
That, that, actually, that's a good question.

254
00:17:25,061 --> 00:17:27,184
Why did you think, um, uh, well...

255
00:17:27,985 --> 00:17:30,888
Like, you kind of just said it, like, you, like, you, you, you thought it was boring.

256
00:17:30,908 --> 00:17:32,570
You, you wanted to improve it and make it better.

257
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,933
But, um, I'm kind of at a point where I'm like, wait, like, if it wasn't...

258
00:17:37,743 --> 00:17:43,345
Like there is a- like I guess like we're all kind of- we're making things, we're looking to hope to make the best magical thing that will be perfect in our heads.

259
00:17:43,425 --> 00:17:48,087
What made you think that this, you know, doing something that was sort of similar to what other devs had done wasn't quite lining up?

260
00:17:48,207 --> 00:17:48,927
I'm sorry, that's a weird-

261
00:17:49,787 --> 00:17:51,528
My question didn't come out great, but I'm just sort of like-

262
00:17:52,008 --> 00:17:54,069
It's kind of worth interrogating, like what made you go...

263
00:17:55,229 --> 00:18:00,231
What- what do you think is the- like like the- cause the version I see is super functional, I love the narrative events that pop up.

264
00:18:00,711 --> 00:18:02,092
Um, what sort of makes you go,

265
00:18:02,112 --> 00:18:05,193
Hang on, this isn't everything it could be, I guess.

266
00:18:06,842 --> 00:18:12,423
Well, I mean, I've sort of made my peace with the map because it is functional and it's not the heart of the game.

267
00:18:12,804 --> 00:18:21,986
Like, I mean, the heart of the game is sort of the travel, but whether the map is this kind of map or a different kind of map actually doesn't make that much of a difference.

268
00:18:22,507 --> 00:18:27,948
Let me just sort of, for a few people that are watching, can I share the screen? I probably should be able to.

269
00:18:29,524 --> 00:18:31,785
Yeah, it'll be a very tiny screen.

270
00:18:31,965 --> 00:18:32,786
Oh yeah, fair enough.

271
00:18:33,106 --> 00:18:35,047
I wanted to show some of the early concepts.

272
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:39,330
If anybody bought the artbook, there's a bunch of early concepts on the map travel gameplay.

273
00:18:39,691 --> 00:18:42,292
We tried isometric views and car-based things.

274
00:18:44,474 --> 00:18:46,635
Sorry, now I lost my train of thought.

275
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:59,326
I suppose it's kind of one of the things too when you're working as like a solo dev or like on a really small team too, you don't have that constant kind of checks and balances to be like, okay, do I need to keep developing this or is it good how it is?

276
00:19:00,086 --> 00:19:15,152
Absolutely. Like I'm, speaking candidly, I'm very proud of Nowhere Prophet. I'm very happy with the thing I built. But I would never do it again. Because I did it on my by myself. And I just sort of, I

277
00:19:17,758 --> 00:19:20,608
Like this, the example of this map iteration.

278
00:19:20,973 --> 00:19:24,795
We had a lot of cool ideas, like I did a lot of brainstorming with my art director, but

279
00:19:24,835 --> 00:19:28,397
he was also, he was never on an even level because he was freelancing.

280
00:19:29,438 --> 00:19:32,299
It was never sort of an, okay, let's talk about what's best for the game, it's more

281
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:33,360
like a service provider.

282
00:19:34,721 --> 00:19:38,182
And we had a lot of cool ideas, and I'm looking at sort of the art book there.

283
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:45,046
But I think at that point it would have been really useful to have somebody to butt heads

284
00:19:45,106 --> 00:19:48,568
with and sort of go, do we really need to do this?

285
00:19:48,668 --> 00:19:50,028
Is it really something that's...

286
00:19:50,775 --> 00:19:52,476
I'm gonna make the game better.

287
00:19:53,176 --> 00:19:55,058
Or is the time invested better elsewhere?

288
00:19:57,099 --> 00:19:59,421
Which is one of the big drawbacks of doing it alone.

289
00:19:59,801 --> 00:20:02,743
There's nobody to sort of keep your weird...

290
00:20:02,763 --> 00:20:05,745
Because at my heart, because you introduced me as a lead developer,

291
00:20:05,765 --> 00:20:07,767
which sort of doesn't quite sit right with me,

292
00:20:07,787 --> 00:20:09,548
because I'm a game designer, goddammit!

293
00:20:09,568 --> 00:20:10,429
Sorry.

294
00:20:10,889 --> 00:20:13,391
But like, keeping the inner designer in check is hard.

295
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:19,139
I just want to do everything perfect, be innovative, have some cool new ideas,

296
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:22,700
and don't do it like the other guys do it, because people have seen it.

297
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:26,221
But you'll never release a game that way.

298
00:20:26,982 --> 00:20:31,983
I spend a lot of time on the map, which is a waste of time, because I ended up with the thing I started on.

299
00:20:32,543 --> 00:20:38,125
But I learned a lot, I had a lot of cool ideas, maybe something of that is another game at some point.

300
00:20:39,503 --> 00:20:43,867
I'm not on a lot of, I only sub in for these GDC streams every now and then, but it's kind

301
00:20:43,887 --> 00:20:47,049
of shocking how often you'll hear a developer be like, yeah, no, I love this game, I love

302
00:20:47,069 --> 00:20:48,650
what I made, but I would never do this again.

303
00:20:51,072 --> 00:20:53,654
And yet, and yet you're kind of thinking about doing it again already, aren't you?

304
00:20:53,674 --> 00:20:57,277
I mean, not Nowhere at Profit, but like, you know, you're already, I mean, you're, you're

305
00:20:57,297 --> 00:21:01,019
working on Nowhere at Profit right now, but like, this isn't the game that makes you quick

306
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:02,621
video games, if I, if I have that right.

307
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:03,661
Wow, this got really depressing.

308
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:05,463
Well, I'm not sure.

309
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:11,042
To be, I said, to be sort of candid, I don't know what I'm, what I'm going to do

310
00:21:11,082 --> 00:21:13,604
next. People keep asking, and they've been asking even before the game launched,

311
00:21:13,624 --> 00:21:15,405
what's going to be next, what's next for you? And I'm like...

312
00:21:16,165 --> 00:21:22,129
Fuck, I don't even know. Once this game is out, I can stop fiddling with it, and I still want to

313
00:21:22,169 --> 00:21:26,651
fiddle with it. I need to do bug fixes, there's still bugs coming in. I need to improve the AI,

314
00:21:26,691 --> 00:21:31,934
it fixes AI bug, but there's still ways to make it better and less stupid. Then I probably need

315
00:21:31,954 --> 00:21:38,038
to do some small content updates. There's console versions, which I'm not going to make myself,

316
00:21:38,098 --> 00:21:41,180
but I need to be involved in because I want to make sure the controls are right.

317
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:45,622
And then it's suddenly 2020. This is how it goes.

318
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,660
And then just gonna take a serious break.

319
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:56,886
Because the key problem on the development pane of No More Prophet was not necessarily

320
00:21:56,926 --> 00:22:02,049
how long it took, I said five years for the first prototypes to release, but the fact

321
00:22:02,069 --> 00:22:02,930
that I did it by myself.

322
00:22:03,731 --> 00:22:11,055
And not all by myself, I had people helping, but nobody on an even footing I guess.

323
00:22:12,603 --> 00:22:16,126
And I would never ever do that again for a project that's even remotely of that size,

324
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:18,047
because it's just going to make me terribly unhappy.

325
00:22:19,488 --> 00:22:25,694
So it sort of depends, like if I end up with a team or sort of a team I can join or collaborate

326
00:22:25,714 --> 00:22:30,958
with, then I'd love doing something like that again, but otherwise it's small stuff for

327
00:22:31,018 --> 00:22:36,343
like doing it in a different setting or surrounding, because that just did not do it for me.

328
00:22:37,877 --> 00:22:41,159
Right on, I am powering up this army here.

329
00:22:42,099 --> 00:22:44,360
We are 20 minutes or so into our chat.

330
00:22:45,061 --> 00:22:46,681
We hope you folks at home are having a good time.

331
00:22:46,741 --> 00:22:49,443
We'd love to take your questions for Martin, if you've got them.

332
00:22:50,603 --> 00:22:53,785
Martin, I am going to go ahead and get to a different topic.

333
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:57,346
I sort of skimmed over the art direction.

334
00:22:57,366 --> 00:23:05,630
Like you said, you had a talented, contracted art director who worked with you on this.

335
00:23:08,223 --> 00:23:13,607
This game, I think, still stands out because it uses a...

336
00:23:13,747 --> 00:23:18,690
Like you said earlier, it's not a bunch of white guys in dusters roaming around the desert.

337
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:23,914
It's instead a bunch of multicultural, though Indian-inspired folks wandering around the desert.

338
00:23:24,935 --> 00:23:26,816
Some with dusters, like our heroes, some with...

339
00:23:27,855 --> 00:23:28,535
Colored robes.

340
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:30,037
Colored robes, yeah.

341
00:23:30,057 --> 00:23:33,099
What was, I guess, like, you know, even though there was an art director you worked with,

342
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:35,301
there was still a specific creative influence you were drawing on.

343
00:23:35,641 --> 00:23:39,545
Would you mind, like, breaking down some of what you were thinking about with, you said

344
00:23:39,565 --> 00:23:42,968
you were drawing on your own sort of, you know, your own background, your own heritage

345
00:23:43,068 --> 00:23:43,688
with some of this.

346
00:23:43,728 --> 00:23:47,632
Would you mind, like, explaining how you translated that, you know, like, because, you know, obviously

347
00:23:47,652 --> 00:23:52,296
this is, this is, this is not what India looks like right now, to the best of my knowledge.

348
00:23:52,496 --> 00:23:56,459
I never meant to be, like, I never wanted to sort of reproduce India in some way.

349
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:10,365
I know it's sort of difficult to say, I mean the whole art direction process was like four months of intensive sort of talk back and forth and sort of figuring out how the game should look.

350
00:24:10,685 --> 00:24:22,170
I sort of started the process with sort of a very strong vision already, sort of like I want these people to be just sort of an Indian inspired world, I want to be very colorful, I want to be on a strange planet.

351
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:29,085
It's sleek science fiction that's broken down cyberpunk aesthetic.

352
00:24:30,767 --> 00:24:34,150
And sort of actually sort of the other day posted these in the discord.

353
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:36,853
Unfortunately, I cannot really share them because then it's tiny as well.

354
00:24:37,173 --> 00:24:38,835
I found a bunch of old PDFs of mine.

355
00:24:38,915 --> 00:24:42,579
I just sort of collected artwork I found on the internet and sort of searched for

356
00:24:42,639 --> 00:24:46,823
specific things to give a starter, sort of an inspiration point for what sort of

357
00:24:46,863 --> 00:24:48,264
the art direction would then start off on.

358
00:24:48,918 --> 00:24:52,701
There's a bunch of really cool stuff, like this one sheet called Humans, which is just

359
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:59,506
like pictures of sort of old Indian dudes with like paint on them and like Arab sort

360
00:24:59,526 --> 00:25:04,610
of head scarves and high fashion and like, I don't know, it's a bunch of interesting

361
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:05,250
stuff in there.

362
00:25:08,333 --> 00:25:12,816
But I don't really know how I came to that starting point, because I was just, I don't

363
00:25:12,836 --> 00:25:15,038
know, I was looking for an interesting world that I was...

364
00:25:15,976 --> 00:25:17,998
sort of I wanted to make a world as well.

365
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:19,680
Like I wanted to do so many things.

366
00:25:20,461 --> 00:25:24,867
Coming off of Banner Saga, which really touched me, I really enjoyed the world, exploring

367
00:25:24,907 --> 00:25:25,367
that world.

368
00:25:25,888 --> 00:25:29,372
And that's one of the sort of the points I sort of started on.

369
00:25:29,392 --> 00:25:34,838
I wanted to make a world that is sort of mine, that's unique to me, that's interesting, that …

370
00:25:35,662 --> 00:25:39,364
Maybe I'll make a tabletop roleplaying game in this world at some point.

371
00:25:39,745 --> 00:25:41,906
You know, that's sort of where I started off.

372
00:25:42,026 --> 00:25:48,830
And for some reason, because I like post-apocalypse and because I sort of felt I wanted to pull some of my background in there,

373
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:50,911
this is sort of where we ended up at.

374
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:56,064
Funny aside, which hasn't so much to do with the setting but with the art style,

375
00:25:56,444 --> 00:26:00,669
in the early days I was very enamored with low poly styles.

376
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:04,633
Think of something like Overland, what they have.

377
00:26:05,134 --> 00:26:06,335
I have a bunch of references in here.

378
00:26:06,375 --> 00:26:09,318
One of them is actually from the Overland lead artist, funnily enough.

379
00:26:09,939 --> 00:26:19,666
We actually sort of tried some 3D aspects out but ended up with this sort of, actually by sort of going over 3D, we played around with shaders and some sort of toon shaders.

380
00:26:19,806 --> 00:26:24,890
We ended up with something that was very sort of black, dark sort of shadows and sort of colors.

381
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:28,132
And from then we sort of, oh this is interesting but we don't want to do 3D.

382
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:31,195
We sort of ended up, because Anjin is really the art director.

383
00:26:32,004 --> 00:26:33,705
is really sort of a comic fan.

384
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:40,087
We ended up looking at graphic novels and Hellboy, which has a really strong aesthetic,

385
00:26:40,388 --> 00:26:42,629
black shadows, very slim highlights.

386
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:48,831
And we used that as a cue to build the visual style, which I'm really, really happy with.

387
00:26:48,891 --> 00:26:52,733
That's one of the things that people constantly give positive feedback about.

388
00:26:52,753 --> 00:26:54,373
The game just looks gorgeous.

389
00:26:56,062 --> 00:27:04,590
Nice, uh, I don't know why this guy's helping me out. He's pushed that rock back there. Yeah, I fixed that bug. It's not gonna happen in the future

390
00:27:04,871 --> 00:27:06,573
At least I hope or at least

391
00:27:07,453 --> 00:27:13,980
Oh, he's just oh well he that's actually clever he's just inciting his guy he's just playing a lot of cards because this guy gets

392
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,722
Bigger. Oh, that's a problem

393
00:27:17,496 --> 00:27:19,517
Oh, that's a problem. Okay, I need to figure this out.

394
00:27:19,998 --> 00:27:23,581
Um, uh, anyway, uh, Alyssa, can I throw the question ball to you?

395
00:27:23,601 --> 00:27:28,144
Yeah, yeah. Um, I'm gonna circle back a little bit, uh, back when you're talking about everyone

396
00:27:28,204 --> 00:27:33,589
clamoring to find out what you're gonna do next. Um, but in terms of your development,

397
00:27:33,669 --> 00:27:37,332
you didn't do an early access period. You did like a beta for a couple months, correct?

398
00:27:38,052 --> 00:27:40,014
No, there was a, there was a first access.

399
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:43,823
Starting at the end of 2017 on itch only.

400
00:27:44,043 --> 00:27:50,810
So it was available on itch from October 2017 to like March this year or February this year.

401
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:51,751
Something like that.

402
00:27:52,311 --> 00:27:56,455
Okay so how would you say that feedback in that period affected your development?

403
00:27:56,475 --> 00:27:57,136
Was it useful?

404
00:27:57,196 --> 00:27:59,178
How did you kind of parse through what you were getting back?

405
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:01,500
It was super useful.

406
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,083
Like the game is so much better for it.

407
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:12,203
I mean, the thing why I went to Itch and not to Steam was sort of to avoid having a shitty

408
00:28:12,263 --> 00:28:16,244
Steam launch, because if you go out of early access, people don't care as much, then, oh,

409
00:28:16,304 --> 00:28:17,305
I'm on Steam finally.

410
00:28:17,325 --> 00:28:22,787
So I didn't want to run that risk of being this, alright, it's out of early access, nobody

411
00:28:22,807 --> 00:28:26,968
cares, and I didn't need to do the early access for the money, I just wanted to build a community

412
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:28,249
and get some feedback from people.

413
00:28:29,089 --> 00:28:34,071
And it did a lot, like I said, it was in early access for one and a half years.

414
00:28:35,699 --> 00:28:38,601
Like one thing for example which is sort of obvious is the wound system.

415
00:28:40,062 --> 00:28:44,285
That was sort of in in the beginning but in the beginning followers could take up to three

416
00:28:44,345 --> 00:28:48,088
wounds and would die with the fourth or with the third I don't quite remember and it's

417
00:28:48,108 --> 00:28:50,630
sort of just ended up being to people who didn't really care.

418
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:54,593
It just ended up too finicky so I did a lot of sort of fine tuning on the wound system

419
00:28:56,234 --> 00:29:00,036
and sort of this is also at some point when the blessing system came in that actually

420
00:29:00,056 --> 00:29:04,440
came out of a streamer that streamed a bunch of times during the first access.

421
00:29:05,604 --> 00:29:13,229
He's actually in the game because during the first access people could buy the game for a more expensive price and then get their face as one of the units.

422
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:21,235
The steward you're using right now is actually Inky, he's one of the people that came in during the first access and he provided just a basic introduction.

423
00:29:21,678 --> 00:29:28,601
Shit ton of valuable feedback. He's been with the game for over a year at this point and it's helped me rebalance a bunch of times.

424
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:31,522
And that's just invaluable, especially if you're on your own.

425
00:29:32,862 --> 00:29:35,964
You just end up with one perspective. So having other people is really good.

426
00:29:38,484 --> 00:29:43,647
Nice. Yeah, I remember, I don't remember where I read it, but back when Early Access was starting to become a thing, there was...

427
00:29:44,029 --> 00:29:49,252
People saying like, oh, well, you only get one launch, like even if you launch an early access, that's going to be your impactful moment.

428
00:29:49,272 --> 00:29:51,193
And there's a risk people won't care when you go 1.0.

429
00:29:51,834 --> 00:29:58,038
So what you did kind of mitigated that in a way, because I didn't know it was an early access because I went to the steam page and it wasn't there.

430
00:29:58,138 --> 00:30:00,699
So it just looked like a regular full launch.

431
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:01,440
So that's interesting.

432
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,181
That was that was kind of the goal.

433
00:30:03,441 --> 00:30:07,423
That's actually if people are interested, there's a blog post I wrote up on Gamma Sutra blog.

434
00:30:08,887 --> 00:30:13,408
About half a year after the early access launch to have the numbers and talk about the feedback a bit.

435
00:30:14,989 --> 00:30:20,590
Also one thing, the blessing feature, that actually sort of came out of the stream as mentioned,

436
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:25,892
because Plaid, he streamed, and since you can rename followers, whenever a follower would do

437
00:30:25,932 --> 00:30:30,293
the killing blow to the enemy, he would rename that follower based on one of the people from

438
00:30:30,313 --> 00:30:35,455
his chat. Which gave me the idea of adding value to that final blow.

439
00:30:36,597 --> 00:30:42,420
And making that an interesting decision, like who is on the board, who am I going to sort of time this to have the final blow.

440
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:48,144
Which is sort of where the blessing mechanic came from, which is really nice because it sort of interacts with the wounding mechanic.

441
00:30:48,204 --> 00:30:57,129
Like, do you want to put in some wounded guys because then you can sort of, if they get the blessing because they do the final blow, they get healed for free, which saves you some resources.

442
00:30:57,629 --> 00:31:03,873
So that's sort of interesting as a, I don't know, as of where this thing came from, I guess.

443
00:31:04,273 --> 00:31:05,534
Yeah, well, it's kind of like a.

444
00:31:06,358 --> 00:31:08,360
social feature and also a strategic feature.

445
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:08,460
Yeah.

446
00:31:10,623 --> 00:31:15,469
I'm going to pull a question from chat where Kthulu wants to know if even though the game

447
00:31:15,509 --> 00:31:19,573
style has changed, is there anything of the original party when they had individual decks

448
00:31:19,934 --> 00:31:21,576
used as inspiration for the leader classes?

449
00:31:22,517 --> 00:31:23,618
Yeah, I mean sort of from the...

450
00:31:24,541 --> 00:31:30,784
from the world building, the idea of technopathy, or I'm not sure how to pronounce it even,

451
00:31:30,844 --> 00:31:35,788
English is hard, I can do it in German, I can't do it in English, I'm just gonna go

452
00:31:35,808 --> 00:31:38,109
with technopathy, was there from the start.

453
00:31:38,149 --> 00:31:42,112
Like there was the idea of these operators, frequency operators that can manipulate technology,

454
00:31:42,572 --> 00:31:47,735
and the initial sort of warrior followers you had were all technopaths.

455
00:31:47,915 --> 00:31:51,597
They were all sort of power people in that sense, and they would sort of defend the convoy.

456
00:31:52,738 --> 00:31:57,980
And the classes, the class ideas and class names and class images are sort of still the same.

457
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:04,143
Like, I have ideas for more classes because if you have three people, you need more than four classes to put in stuff.

458
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:15,247
So there's some names and ideas for future classes, but making a class for the current iteration of the game is pretty intensive.

459
00:32:15,482 --> 00:32:21,949
Because you need a bunch of split- you need cards, you need to find out sort of deck builds and how to sort of put them in their different unlockables.

460
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:28,976
But it's sort of like all the, what used to be individual heroes are now sort of individual classes for their character.

461
00:32:30,938 --> 00:32:31,258
Nice.

462
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:33,500
How's it going, Brett?

463
00:32:33,981 --> 00:32:35,282
I am hanging in here.

464
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:38,471
Well, you're doing good so far.

465
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:57,990
The Witcher's

466
00:32:58,911 --> 00:33:02,495
the Witcher card game and I was thinking a lot about deck building playing that because I've

467
00:33:02,615 --> 00:33:07,821
Noticed that as a my kind of player deck building is a scary feat for me in games like this

468
00:33:07,961 --> 00:33:10,283
I thought I talk too much here about extra miniatures, which is a game

469
00:33:10,323 --> 00:33:12,806
I play where you're essentially always deck building because you're

470
00:33:14,376 --> 00:33:16,518
Changing the ships you want to fly in, that's like building a deck.

471
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:20,201
But when it comes to putting a deck of cards together that I'm randomly pulling things from

472
00:33:20,241 --> 00:33:22,243
and trying to figure out a combo, that is very frightening to me.

473
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:25,026
What did you sort of learn about teaching players, like,

474
00:33:25,346 --> 00:33:27,228
hey, you should be thinking about pulling-

475
00:33:27,288 --> 00:33:28,589
like, how did you teach players deck building?

476
00:33:28,609 --> 00:33:30,411
I'm genuinely sort of wanting to know your thoughts about that.

477
00:33:31,291 --> 00:33:32,793
Actually, I'm not sure I'm doing it enough.

478
00:33:33,734 --> 00:33:37,317
There's a rulebook that sort of has a section on strategy and how to build a deck.

479
00:33:39,075 --> 00:33:42,919
But the game actually doesn't do a lot of it, sort of teaching you how to build a good deck.

480
00:33:45,161 --> 00:33:46,002
And it's hard, like...

481
00:33:47,164 --> 00:33:51,989
What's a good deck? A good deck is generally not too big, because then you sort of...

482
00:33:52,429 --> 00:33:53,290
Limit your choices.

483
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,612
I don't know, it's...

484
00:33:55,172 --> 00:33:57,335
It's a good question, I don't think I have an answer for it.

485
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,710
I think I could do the job better than I do.

486
00:33:59,730 --> 00:33:59,770
Um...

487
00:34:02,471 --> 00:34:02,771
Yeah.

488
00:34:03,031 --> 00:34:05,792
I guess technically it's a bad question then.

489
00:34:06,152 --> 00:34:06,312
Um...

490
00:34:06,972 --> 00:34:08,453
Is deck building just actual magic?

491
00:34:08,493 --> 00:34:09,013
Deck building.

492
00:34:09,033 --> 00:34:09,553
It's magic.

493
00:34:10,213 --> 00:34:10,333
Um...

494
00:34:11,093 --> 00:34:11,234
Uh...

495
00:34:11,334 --> 00:34:12,874
I guess then let's talk about the individual cards.

496
00:34:12,894 --> 00:34:13,674
Like, where did you sort of...

497
00:34:13,714 --> 00:34:15,875
Like, once you realize you're doing a card system, it's sort of like...

498
00:34:15,915 --> 00:34:17,596
It's a little bit Hearthstone-y in some ways.

499
00:34:17,636 --> 00:34:19,996
You know, attacking a hero, a mana system.

500
00:34:20,036 --> 00:34:20,337
But um...

501
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:27,237
Where did you start thinking up card ideas and hierarchies for how these cards would work?

502
00:34:27,277 --> 00:34:34,262
What was your process for saying, OK, I need this kind of cards, I'm curious what your workflow was for designing units as cards?

503
00:34:36,924 --> 00:34:39,366
I went through a lot of iterations.

504
00:34:39,406 --> 00:34:45,151
It starts with, what's my basic attack health stats?

505
00:34:45,633 --> 00:34:45,693
So

506
00:34:45,713 --> 00:34:47,354
gameplay changes that I still wanted to have in there.

507
00:35:10,162 --> 00:35:19,369
Then it was a little bit about giving them different identities, sort of finding different parts in the gameplay that makes sense to sort of build around and put them to the factions.

508
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:25,034
I think that's something that also could have been done better, sort of could have cleaned that up a little more.

509
00:35:25,054 --> 00:35:30,359
I think in hindsight, 10 factions is probably sort of cluttering it up too much for the player.

510
00:35:30,379 --> 00:35:34,462
I just liked all of them too much to, you know, scrap any one of them.

511
00:35:36,989 --> 00:35:50,719
And then it sort of... I had, I don't know, I guess 300 something units and I had them in the first access and then did a balancing through a bunch of out that just didn't work and replaced them and sort of kept fine-tuning sort of...

512
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:54,091
what they were and where they belong to.

513
00:35:54,111 --> 00:35:58,773
And I said there's a bunch of moments where I just shoveled stuff around to make the faction

514
00:35:58,793 --> 00:35:59,553
identity stronger.

515
00:35:59,593 --> 00:36:03,495
It's like, alright, this guy is nice but he needs to be over there, and then this guy

516
00:36:03,515 --> 00:36:07,036
needs to go over here because I need to have equal numbers on the factions because they

517
00:36:07,076 --> 00:36:09,757
have chances to roll, and that kind of thing.

518
00:36:14,058 --> 00:36:14,539
Right on.

519
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:18,860
Alyssa, I need to pay attention to this text.

520
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,741
I think you're going to throw the questions all your way.

521
00:36:22,198 --> 00:36:27,982
So I think I ask this, like, some variation of this question every time we do a stream with someone who has roguelike elements in their game,

522
00:36:28,182 --> 00:36:38,370
but the thing that's persistently interesting to me with roguelike games is that you take failure or losing a unit or something and you make it into kind of like a positive learning moment.

523
00:36:39,611 --> 00:36:43,714
So I guess, how did you balance with the roguelike elements in this game? How did you balance...

524
00:36:44,861 --> 00:36:49,002
Kind of that fail, like quote-unquote fail state, like punishing the player, they're losing something forever,

525
00:36:49,242 --> 00:36:52,844
with encouraging them to try new things and learning from their mistakes.

526
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:57,966
Oh god, so many good and hard questions.

527
00:37:01,176 --> 00:37:04,981
I mean, you don't lose everything, there's some progress you can make in the game, like

528
00:37:05,001 --> 00:37:09,446
you can unlock new stuff and you can sort of unlock new stuff, like new perks for the

529
00:37:09,466 --> 00:37:10,227
convoys you have.

530
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:15,854
So even if you lose something, you still sort of make some progress somewhere, which I feel

531
00:37:15,894 --> 00:37:18,697
even though each convoy has three perks and they're sort of...

532
00:37:19,859 --> 00:37:22,120
There's small bonuses in the travel gameplay.

533
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:25,022
Like, you heal a little better, you sell stuff for a little bit more batteries,

534
00:37:25,342 --> 00:37:25,802
that kind of thing.

535
00:37:25,902 --> 00:37:28,223
Nothing that has a big impact, but stuff that feels nice,

536
00:37:28,664 --> 00:37:30,445
and that you sort of have fun unlocking.

537
00:37:30,825 --> 00:37:35,167
So I think that's a good sort of start to make that fail state not just feel super bad,

538
00:37:35,968 --> 00:37:37,889
but again, sort of, you don't want to overdo it,

539
00:37:37,909 --> 00:37:40,230
because then you can just grind your way through the roguelike

540
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:42,472
by just getting really good by having high stats.

541
00:37:42,972 --> 00:37:44,493
So it's just like small bonuses.

542
00:37:45,233 --> 00:37:47,474
And I think sort of the...

543
00:37:51,042 --> 00:37:57,007
The audience that likes to play card games likes to have interesting puzzles.

544
00:37:57,728 --> 00:38:02,192
You start to turn, there's a situation on the board, there's a situation in your hand,

545
00:38:02,792 --> 00:38:05,174
and a lot of the stuff you can do is very predictable.

546
00:38:05,595 --> 00:38:09,418
There's some random effects, but for example Hearthstone has a lot of unpredictability

547
00:38:09,458 --> 00:38:09,698
to it.

548
00:38:10,521 --> 00:38:15,163
Which makes it really good for new players because they can just win by sheer luck and they have a lot of fuck yeah moment

549
00:38:16,184 --> 00:38:20,065
But for me, it's just it's too much like that's one of the things I really don't like about a hearthstone

550
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:22,846
There's just too much randomness. I can just make or break a game

551
00:38:24,107 --> 00:38:25,047
so sort of

552
00:38:25,968 --> 00:38:28,349
You start you have this sort of interesting puzzle. These are my cards

553
00:38:28,369 --> 00:38:31,170
this is the situation and then you sort of look for what's the

554
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:36,032
The optimal play for this turn and maybe for the next turn and maybe the turn after that

555
00:38:37,073 --> 00:38:38,953
And that's sort of always an interesting puzzle

556
00:38:40,113 --> 00:38:44,336
I'm not sure what the game is about, but I think that's what the people play for.

557
00:38:44,696 --> 00:38:48,959
They don't play to sort of win the game, they play to have interesting puzzles and sort of have

558
00:38:49,419 --> 00:38:50,820
them transmute over time.

559
00:38:53,582 --> 00:38:54,022
Right on.

560
00:38:54,042 --> 00:38:57,964
I am going to quickly get myself more armor.

561
00:38:59,665 --> 00:39:04,068
And then checking my question pile...

562
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:15,247
Uh, you just sort of talked about puzzles and like stringing together combos and I noticed that like, you know, when I'm trying to set up, you know, when I'm picking moves, I'm sort of saying,

563
00:39:15,367 --> 00:39:20,854
Okay, what's the unit that can match my energy now versus what's the unit that when I play it now and then next turn I can play something else?

564
00:39:21,355 --> 00:39:25,780
Um, in your head, like, I guess, like, what was your idea? What do you think makes a fun combo?

565
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,342
In a game like this. Like how do you...

566
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:29,904
That's sort of a generic strange question.

567
00:39:30,324 --> 00:39:31,565
And I apologize for that.

568
00:39:31,705 --> 00:39:34,308
But I sort of think it's worth noting.

569
00:39:34,408 --> 00:39:35,969
Because you can sort of say, oh like...

570
00:39:36,369 --> 00:39:38,491
When I put this card down, this next card will...

571
00:39:39,792 --> 00:39:41,094
Do 3 damage to everything.

572
00:39:41,134 --> 00:39:42,675
And then you go, actually no one uses it.

573
00:39:42,695 --> 00:39:43,836
Because it's not even fun.

574
00:39:43,896 --> 00:39:45,337
Because for some reason.

575
00:39:45,377 --> 00:39:46,979
I guess that's where my head is right now.

576
00:39:47,539 --> 00:39:49,341
I mean sort of a good combo I think...

577
00:39:49,941 --> 00:39:51,643
Needs to feel like the player discovered it.

578
00:39:52,889 --> 00:39:57,152
Like it needs to be like, oh, oh, if I do this and then this, this makes a lot of sense.

579
00:39:57,212 --> 00:40:00,715
Like you see this one piece that we're like, all right, this is okay, but I'm not sure.

580
00:40:00,735 --> 00:40:04,377
And you see this other piece and you go like, oh, wait, wait, there's these two together,

581
00:40:04,758 --> 00:40:12,203
you know? And if the piece says A, says A, use B for me, and B says A, I work well with A,

582
00:40:12,223 --> 00:40:16,327
then it just, you know, it's boring. But it's interesting if there's like,

583
00:40:18,328 --> 00:40:21,210
sort of, if you can find them and if they're in a lot of sort of axes.

584
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:31,459
One thing I sort of found out in the design process of the cards, and specifically again when I redid the equipment system a couple...

585
00:40:33,763 --> 00:40:38,445
...throughout the entire equipment system and redid it, because it just didn't combo well enough.

586
00:40:39,346 --> 00:40:45,789
And I did try to come up with better effects that had more combo potential.

587
00:40:45,809 --> 00:40:52,992
Kind of always err on the side of, alright, this thing needs to work in a way that a lot of other things can work off of it.

588
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:59,515
If that makes sense. I struggle to come up with an actual example right now, but...

589
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:06,790
I get what you mean. I play a lot of Hitman.

590
00:41:07,451 --> 00:41:12,435
And there's this really cool phenomenon in that game where you have these moments where you do something really cool.

591
00:41:12,455 --> 00:41:17,500
And you're like, I thought of this. This is great. I solved this big murder puzzle. I executed this really cool thing.

592
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,423
And then the developers are back. They're like, no, we actually meant for you to do that.

593
00:41:20,463 --> 00:41:27,489
But crafting those moments where it feels like you did something really creative and substantial is a difficult beast to tame and explain, I'd imagine.

594
00:41:28,346 --> 00:41:32,530
Yeah, I mean there's one example is there's robust units that when they get killed they

595
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:36,473
heal up so they get reset to 1 health and they get pushed back and if they cannot be

596
00:41:36,493 --> 00:41:41,056
pushed back anymore they die, which actually is pretty strong, I'm thinking about nerfing

597
00:41:41,077 --> 00:41:41,617
that a little bit.

598
00:41:42,658 --> 00:41:48,082
But like, they get reset to 1 health and this reset to 1 health could be just reset, but

599
00:41:48,122 --> 00:41:53,086
it's a heal, which means everything that triggers a heal triggers really well, works really

600
00:41:53,106 --> 00:41:53,987
well with robust units.

601
00:41:54,685 --> 00:41:58,688
And I think that's just making a lot of pieces that interact with a lot of pieces

602
00:41:58,708 --> 00:42:03,711
allows people to find enough of them to make an interesting deck out of it.

603
00:42:06,493 --> 00:42:11,777
Right on. Just a heads up for chat, we got about 15 minutes left in our conversation with Martin.

604
00:42:12,498 --> 00:42:18,882
We would love it if you would ask some questions. That sounded a little more desperate.

605
00:42:20,483 --> 00:42:21,184
Please, please.

606
00:42:23,805 --> 00:42:26,466
Oh dear, my wifi is acting up.

607
00:42:26,806 --> 00:42:30,287
I hope that doesn't cause problems for the stream, which is on a wired connection.

608
00:42:30,307 --> 00:42:33,228
Okay, cool. Looking good, looking good.

609
00:42:33,248 --> 00:42:34,909
But yeah, we'd love to hear your questions. That wasn't...

610
00:42:35,429 --> 00:42:38,510
I mean, you know, there's only a little less written that, like, you know, questions...

611
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:40,911
Questions and gameplay can be hard.

612
00:42:42,492 --> 00:42:49,178
Martin, I guess we were the GDC Twitch channel. We can talk about GDC. You have a GDC 2011 shirt.

613
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:55,224
Let's move a little bit outside the world of making nowhere profit, I guess.

614
00:42:56,125 --> 00:43:00,409
You said this year you were skipping GDC because you were taking an off-conference here, and I imagine you had to actually ship your game.

615
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:01,851
That's important.

616
00:43:03,945 --> 00:43:07,746
How, you know, as a game designer, I guess we haven't gotten to talk about your background at all.

617
00:43:07,786 --> 00:43:13,048
So, like, what was your foundation as a game designer and what made you want to make games like Nowhere Profit?

618
00:43:13,108 --> 00:43:19,690
And say, like, I can make a cool world that's expressed through cards and numbers and have it feel as real as a book or as other things, I guess.

619
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:22,091
Forgive the cross-medium comparison, if you will.

620
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:23,311
No, it's all good.

621
00:43:23,691 --> 00:43:25,152
So, I don't know, my background sort of...

622
00:43:26,392 --> 00:43:27,093
I always...

623
00:43:27,533 --> 00:43:27,673
Like...

624
00:43:27,693 --> 00:43:27,733
So...

625
00:43:30,407 --> 00:43:35,390
It took me a while to understand that not everybody knows what they want to do with their life.

626
00:43:35,911 --> 00:43:37,051
Because I always knew.

627
00:43:37,411 --> 00:43:42,474
Like I was six years old and I was making terrible games that didn't work on a CD64 Commodore in BASIC.

628
00:43:45,556 --> 00:43:55,323
I was making sort of, I have a sort of box with trashy, terrible roller dice to move card board games and built as like an eight year old.

629
00:43:55,343 --> 00:44:04,749
I don't know, I always made games. I spent a lot of time in my high school years sort of modding Quake, which sort of dates me, I guess.

630
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:07,430
Quake 1, Quake 2, Quake 3, did a bunch of mods.

631
00:44:09,746 --> 00:44:13,466
So, games were always something I was really interested in and spent a lot of time on.

632
00:44:13,486 --> 00:44:14,166
I learned a lot.

633
00:44:14,346 --> 00:44:18,307
I learned 3D modeling from making Quake II weapon mods, kind of.

634
00:44:19,167 --> 00:44:25,429
And then, I actually studied architecture, because when I was done with school I wanted

635
00:44:25,469 --> 00:44:29,149
to study and there was no real game options.

636
00:44:29,209 --> 00:44:31,570
And I didn't want to do coding either, because that seemed too dry.

637
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:32,830
I wanted to do something more creative.

638
00:44:34,864 --> 00:44:39,267
So I started architecture, was done with that, and was like, ah, fuck it, I want to do games instead, and went on doing games.

639
00:44:39,287 --> 00:44:44,931
I don't know, what do you, I don't know, like, uh, do you, what do you still think about your architecture?

640
00:44:45,332 --> 00:44:48,234
Like, like, do you still, like, does any of that still influence your work as a designer?

641
00:44:49,094 --> 00:44:53,138
I mean, it, it, the architecture degree has, has, uh, in...

642
00:44:54,063 --> 00:45:02,267
Irrevocably, man damn English is hard, irrevocably, irrevocably, whatever, I'm not gonna repeat it a fourth time,

643
00:45:03,808 --> 00:45:10,671
changed and sort of bent my aesthetic sense, like people hate naked concrete walls and I love them.

644
00:45:12,032 --> 00:45:14,333
It's just, that's just what happens to you I guess.

645
00:45:15,233 --> 00:45:20,476
So I think it sort of influenced my aesthetic sensibilities a lot and it's also sort of given me a sharper sort of...

646
00:45:21,104 --> 00:45:25,527
focus of a designer in general, because even though it sort of feels like it's very different,

647
00:45:27,649 --> 00:45:32,172
architecture and game design are actually sort of close, because in both cases you're not the guy

648
00:45:32,212 --> 00:45:37,595
necessarily making everything, but you need to be the guy that sort of keeps craft and arts

649
00:45:38,116 --> 00:45:43,439
sort of in balance, and make sure the thing gets built, functions, and is sort of aesthetically

650
00:45:43,479 --> 00:45:49,283
pleasing. Is that sort of an answer, I guess? It is. Yeah, that makes sense.

651
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:55,401
Sorry, I'm sitting here looking trying to figure out how the heck I'm gonna win this fight.

652
00:45:56,442 --> 00:45:59,143
Yeah, you're actually fighting one of the bosses that I tweaked down a bit.

653
00:45:59,263 --> 00:46:00,824
I hope you updated your game on Steam.

654
00:46:01,024 --> 00:46:01,204
Nope.

655
00:46:01,704 --> 00:46:02,364
Um...

656
00:46:03,344 --> 00:46:06,826
He's, uh, his, his, like, he was actually the one that I got the most complaints about,

657
00:46:06,866 --> 00:46:11,848
which is funny because in, in the beta test, I don't, not a lot of people complained about him.

658
00:46:12,308 --> 00:46:16,850
He, his effect is whenever one of his guys gets killed, he gets them back on his hands for cheaper

659
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:19,771
and can play him again, which basically just means he never runs out of guys.

660
00:46:21,632 --> 00:46:27,535
In the early release version, the effect would trigger for every guy you kill.

661
00:46:27,756 --> 00:46:32,018
So it doesn't matter how many you killed, as long as he had room in his hand, he would get them back.

662
00:46:32,478 --> 00:46:35,740
And now it's been changed to it only triggers on the first guy you kill.

663
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,062
So it's sort of the question is, which one do you want to pick off?

664
00:46:39,723 --> 00:46:42,164
In this case, which one will he run against you to get back?

665
00:46:43,205 --> 00:46:46,207
So it becomes a more active player choice.

666
00:46:46,547 --> 00:46:48,648
It's not like, alright, whatever I do, he's going to get them back.

667
00:46:49,249 --> 00:46:49,889
Which one can I...

668
00:46:51,253 --> 00:46:55,516
Take off is the least bad for me to give them back to him.

669
00:46:56,597 --> 00:46:57,337
So that's interesting.

670
00:46:57,798 --> 00:46:58,098
I find.

671
00:46:58,118 --> 00:47:00,339
Look what I got past him.

672
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:03,982
When we were talking before the stream, you mentioned like another

673
00:47:04,142 --> 00:47:07,364
similar tweak you've had to make where there there is some system

674
00:47:07,404 --> 00:47:10,886
that you change so that it became more involved on the player

675
00:47:10,906 --> 00:47:14,489
side. So became a more strategic thing too, but you have another

676
00:47:14,529 --> 00:47:17,491
boss, which was always whenever you dealt damage to him with

677
00:47:17,531 --> 00:47:18,571
a follower the following you would.

678
00:47:19,438 --> 00:47:22,899
So now it's always the first one each turn, so the question is which one of mine am I

679
00:47:22,919 --> 00:47:27,680
going to sacrifice to make room for the other people, which makes them a lot more interesting.

680
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:32,901
I need to do a bunch of other tweaks, like for example the Glory Seeker you just fought.

681
00:47:33,041 --> 00:47:37,643
He always gets his people back, and his deck has a lot of synergy with stuff that does

682
00:47:37,703 --> 00:47:38,723
effects when they enter battle.

683
00:47:39,203 --> 00:47:43,164
So he puts them out, gets an incisional effect, he loses them, gets them back, puts them out

684
00:47:43,184 --> 00:47:43,364
again.

685
00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:49,894
And I sort of had to lower the synergy of the enemy decks in the early levels a little bit.

686
00:47:49,934 --> 00:47:58,161
Because if he just pumps out stuff all the time, he just gets too strong when your deck is still trying to find its footing.

687
00:47:58,321 --> 00:48:03,985
Like in the first map, it's currently still sort of the hardest because your deck is sort of unoptimized.

688
00:48:04,005 --> 00:48:11,751
You're sort of trying to get stuff together to build up a strategy, find some equipment that synergizes with something you can build.

689
00:48:12,365 --> 00:48:15,087
And then sort of find people to put in there to make it stronger and stronger.

690
00:48:15,107 --> 00:48:20,209
And early on, if the enemies are just really well sort of synergized,

691
00:48:20,389 --> 00:48:22,030
you'll have trouble sort of keeping pace.

692
00:48:24,331 --> 00:48:24,571
Nice.

693
00:48:26,092 --> 00:48:29,913
Brent, I'm going to do a two-parter question where I post something and then you polish it, okay?

694
00:48:30,194 --> 00:48:32,034
Sure.

695
00:48:32,054 --> 00:48:35,036
So you talked earlier about wanting to kind of create a world.

696
00:48:35,056 --> 00:48:37,897
So I'm just going to kind of segue into narrative stuff a little bit.

697
00:48:37,957 --> 00:48:41,059
And then you had mentioned that fight in Mass Effect with Saren,

698
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:41,979
it's like one of like...

699
00:48:42,552 --> 00:48:44,073
My favorite moments in games ever.

700
00:48:44,093 --> 00:48:45,094
I love Mass Effect 1.

701
00:48:45,194 --> 00:48:46,535
Oh god, it's so good.

702
00:48:46,696 --> 00:48:48,738
Do the other games ever quite capture that narrative side?

703
00:48:48,758 --> 00:48:52,902
I still sometimes watch the YouTube video of the conversation with Sovereign,

704
00:48:52,942 --> 00:48:55,985
the first one you have, because it's just such an awesome...

705
00:48:56,005 --> 00:48:56,925
God, I get goosebumps.

706
00:48:56,966 --> 00:48:59,548
Oh yeah, like playing through that was like this moment.

707
00:48:59,568 --> 00:49:00,529
I loved it.

708
00:49:02,004 --> 00:49:14,289
But I kind of want to ask, I haven't played the game, Brian has, so I want to kind of segue into more about like the narrative side of things and how that kind of, that initial thought may have carried throughout the game, or if it didn't, or kind of go from there.

709
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:17,811
So I don't know, Brian, if you can elaborate as someone who's played the game more on that.

710
00:49:17,831 --> 00:49:27,215
I think it does. I mean, I'd say my only comment is that the convoy still feels a little introversional, like even though there's a whole crowd of people down here. I love this graphic representation of...

711
00:49:27,815 --> 00:49:33,419
All my units have gotten a little attached to some of them as they get kills, but if I'm being frankly honest, it's still...

712
00:49:33,779 --> 00:49:38,042
It's missing a little bit of that Oregon Trail, you know, X person you cared about has died of dysentery.

713
00:49:38,723 --> 00:49:40,144
Um, uh, where that bandit...

714
00:49:40,164 --> 00:49:41,184
Oh, it's called dysentery.

715
00:49:42,985 --> 00:49:44,026
I would've said dysentery.

716
00:49:45,417 --> 00:49:46,238
Our language stinks.

717
00:49:47,579 --> 00:49:49,260
Look, we're not here to debate the English language, guys.

718
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:52,703
I was like 10 when I discovered that one. It was a horrible word.

719
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,165
I was like 9.

720
00:49:54,305 --> 00:49:54,705
I think the...

721
00:49:54,865 --> 00:49:57,207
But I think the underlying theme is very obvious and clear.

722
00:49:58,508 --> 00:49:58,948
What is it?

723
00:49:59,149 --> 00:50:00,009
How would you describe it?

724
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:01,611
Um...

725
00:50:03,212 --> 00:50:04,833
This is not a quiz. There's no wrong answer.

726
00:50:05,621 --> 00:50:06,802
Oh, there's a wrong answer, alright.

727
00:50:06,822 --> 00:50:11,186
There's always a wrong answer when you're hosting a stream.

728
00:50:11,886 --> 00:50:15,790
So I got the sense when I'm playing this game, like, I am searching for an unattainable...

729
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:17,472
For almost an unattainable goal, you know.

730
00:50:17,532 --> 00:50:18,472
Like, we're looking for...

731
00:50:18,873 --> 00:50:21,655
We're on a journey to the Holy Land, if you will.

732
00:50:22,016 --> 00:50:22,676
Like, that kind of...

733
00:50:22,876 --> 00:50:24,658
That's very instinctual as I'm going.

734
00:50:24,738 --> 00:50:27,200
I'm going somewhere that no one believes I can go.

735
00:50:28,081 --> 00:50:29,523
Like, being on a sacred mission like that.

736
00:50:30,123 --> 00:50:35,626
Um, and having this crew of followers with me, um, uh, my, my sense for them is like occasionally,

737
00:50:35,666 --> 00:50:38,808
like when they show up in the chats, like I can see when their name is highlighted in

738
00:50:38,868 --> 00:50:41,410
green and I get the, you know, that they've done something that helps me out.

739
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:45,192
Um, and I know that these are the people who will get me there.

740
00:50:45,472 --> 00:50:48,474
What's interesting to me is that I get way more sense of character from the people I

741
00:50:48,534 --> 00:50:52,216
meet in this game, from the shamans, from the guides who I couldn't afford to hire.

742
00:50:52,256 --> 00:50:53,677
And so it got some of my people killed.

743
00:50:54,177 --> 00:50:58,320
Um, the- sort of the- the thing we're pushing against, the other people in this world, the people we encounter,

744
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:00,882
give me way more of a sense of the world and the sense of how people are.

745
00:51:01,202 --> 00:51:04,284
And it's interesting, cause like, you sort of get from the idea of an apocalypse that everything's dying.

746
00:51:04,705 --> 00:51:06,726
What I love about my sense of this game is that,

747
00:51:07,266 --> 00:51:10,949
every- everything actually feels pretty alive, like everyone's got a way of living, um,

748
00:51:11,369 --> 00:51:13,170
the slave stuff is- is a li-

749
00:51:13,571 --> 00:51:17,613
the slave stuff is sadly not cool, and by- that's a very light way to put it.

750
00:51:18,114 --> 00:51:19,014
No, no, no, no, like slav-

751
00:51:19,735 --> 00:51:20,215
Jesus Christ.

752
00:51:21,776 --> 00:51:25,737
The slavery thing is the only thing where I'm like, wow, this is like the biggest sense I have that the world is not right.

753
00:51:25,797 --> 00:51:28,097
But there is also a sense that people are alive.

754
00:51:28,957 --> 00:51:32,198
So those are the things that have stuck with me as a player so far.

755
00:51:33,638 --> 00:51:35,519
These militaristic factions that have popped up.

756
00:51:35,539 --> 00:51:36,479
I thought it was interesting.

757
00:51:36,499 --> 00:51:40,920
I was paying attention to, you know, I think I have in here some units in my convoy.

758
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,422
Uh, that's not the right deck, that's not the right button over here.

759
00:51:45,662 --> 00:51:50,284
Uh, there's a couple units who have kind of a more of a colonial outlook about them, like they're wearing sort of...

760
00:51:50,324 --> 00:51:51,644
Yeah, the Rajguard.

761
00:51:51,884 --> 00:51:54,365
The Rajguard, yeah. And I have one of the Scion guys.

762
00:51:54,385 --> 00:51:55,966
The Strategist's down there, I think, too.

763
00:51:56,445 --> 00:51:57,867
Yeah, I have a strategist right here.

764
00:51:57,887 --> 00:51:57,927
No.

765
00:52:17,049 --> 00:52:18,889
If the YouTuber is the ultimate colonist, I don't know.

766
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:20,630
Um, there's- there are some sort of a...

767
00:52:21,331 --> 00:52:22,631
Like- like, I like that sense of it.

768
00:52:22,671 --> 00:52:29,154
I like the sense that there are ways that people, you know, who seek power have dressed themselves like other people who are just sort of trying to get by who have dressed themselves.

769
00:52:29,835 --> 00:52:31,736
Um, it gives me a sense of place in being.

770
00:52:31,876 --> 00:52:35,618
I- I know this is a question for you, but I guess I am the interviewed right now.

771
00:52:35,638 --> 00:52:37,518
But yeah, that's- that's my- that's my sense-

772
00:52:37,619 --> 00:52:39,479
Here we go, the Scion Instigator. Like, look at this.

773
00:52:39,539 --> 00:52:41,580
Like, the guy's got a suit, uh, he's got a-

774
00:52:41,981 --> 00:52:44,902
Not just a suit, he's wearing like a, you know, high-necked-

775
00:52:45,022 --> 00:52:46,263
Fancy, fancy shirt.

776
00:52:46,652 --> 00:52:49,334
Yeah, um, Harris licked back.

777
00:52:50,035 --> 00:52:51,656
Man, it looks like he has a gut stone and a comb.

778
00:52:52,677 --> 00:52:54,619
But yeah, that's where I'm at with the game, I guess.

779
00:52:54,799 --> 00:52:55,020
Yeah.

780
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,643
I mean, that's sort of what I was aiming for.

781
00:52:58,663 --> 00:53:05,089
I sort of agree with your assessment that the people in the convoy don't get enough character.

782
00:53:05,109 --> 00:53:09,834
In hindsight, I feel like the event system is the one thing that would have...

783
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,920
I'm not, it isn't quite where it should be.

784
00:53:14,841 --> 00:53:16,081
I did it by myself, most of it.

785
00:53:16,181 --> 00:53:19,042
I didn't write all the events, because that's way too much anyway.

786
00:53:20,562 --> 00:53:23,163
But I had to sort of, at some point, just sort of get it done.

787
00:53:24,423 --> 00:53:28,204
But I think, especially the event system, would have benefited,

788
00:53:28,344 --> 00:53:30,345
like there's a bunch of events, there's a whole bunch of events,

789
00:53:30,365 --> 00:53:32,185
that are just like, hey, you meet some people, let's fight.

790
00:53:33,726 --> 00:53:38,946
If I would have just scrapped those, put markers on the map, alright this is a fight, start

791
00:53:38,966 --> 00:53:43,467
the fight and then have the guy on the other side give you like a one line bark, like I'm

792
00:53:43,487 --> 00:53:45,768
gonna make you my slaves, that's enough.

793
00:53:45,948 --> 00:53:51,248
Like we don't need all this text, it's great for world building but it's a lot of cruft.

794
00:53:51,288 --> 00:53:55,809
I would have rather sort of boiled down to fewer events and have them be more complex

795
00:53:55,869 --> 00:54:00,270
and have more events sort of involve your people on sort of like strings where they,

796
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:01,930
One of your guys is the

797
00:54:02,828 --> 00:54:03,149
I don't know.

798
00:54:03,709 --> 00:54:06,189
He's a war criminal.

799
00:54:06,869 --> 00:54:11,250
This is a story, and it's randomly, you pick one of your guys every time, or like, every

800
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:12,791
fifth match you get a war criminal.

801
00:54:12,831 --> 00:54:16,352
We pick one of them, he's a war criminal, and if you don't kill him, you can have the

802
00:54:16,392 --> 00:54:19,832
story that sort of sometimes, like, and then you get to a milestone, and it sort of interacts

803
00:54:19,852 --> 00:54:22,513
with a milestone in different ways based on which of these people you have.

804
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,494
That'd be super cool!

805
00:54:25,374 --> 00:54:25,654
But...

806
00:54:27,774 --> 00:54:28,695
Yeah, I think that was the...

807
00:54:29,662 --> 00:54:36,307
The gist of the question I was trying to figure out words for before was with all the fights

808
00:54:36,327 --> 00:54:39,370
where you mentioned tweaking them so there's more strategic player choice.

809
00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:43,193
I was wondering if there's a similar thread in the narrative elements of the game or the

810
00:54:43,233 --> 00:54:44,654
conversations you have with the events.

811
00:54:45,335 --> 00:54:50,879
I mean, the one thing that I think really helps the event system is that there's moments

812
00:54:50,939 --> 00:54:55,383
where the event pops up and there's a picture of one of you guys on the left and he goes

813
00:54:55,423 --> 00:54:56,564
like, hey, I can do something.

814
00:54:57,028 --> 00:54:58,829
There's some extra text.

815
00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:02,953
Basically what the game does is it looks for a specific faction or specific rarity.

816
00:55:03,313 --> 00:55:05,215
Like, do you have a beast that's at least a rare?

817
00:55:05,835 --> 00:55:08,858
And then that unlocks options where you go like,

818
00:55:08,918 --> 00:55:12,541
alright, let the beast snarl at these people to intimidate them.

819
00:55:12,801 --> 00:55:17,625
Or send that guy to run a distraction because he's a bandit and he's good at distracting.

820
00:55:17,705 --> 00:55:22,229
Or make that guy blow something up because he's from the Union, and the Unioners, they blow things up.

821
00:55:23,704 --> 00:55:28,589
And that's where people get a little bit more fleshed out,

822
00:55:29,050 --> 00:55:33,634
but it still doesn't give them a lot of character, because there's not a lot of personality behind these.

823
00:55:34,455 --> 00:55:35,536
Because there's very little moments.

824
00:55:36,337 --> 00:55:38,659
But that's really interesting things, I think.

825
00:55:39,379 --> 00:55:43,243
No, I do like the composition of your party can kind of play into these random encounters,

826
00:55:43,303 --> 00:55:46,366
or give you additional things you wouldn't have without that specific party member.

827
00:55:46,386 --> 00:55:47,307
So that's great, I like that.

828
00:55:52,164 --> 00:55:54,945
We only have a few minutes left here. I really want to finish this fight.

829
00:55:55,025 --> 00:55:58,706
We're just going to wrap up today. Thank you all for watching.

830
00:55:58,746 --> 00:56:01,967
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Well I'm going to...

831
00:56:02,167 --> 00:56:04,247
Oh. Well, I'm going to...

832
00:56:04,287 --> 00:56:07,508
First I'm going to make sure that guy's out of the way.

833
00:56:07,968 --> 00:56:09,348
And then steadily wear this guy down.

834
00:56:10,388 --> 00:56:13,469
Thank you all for joining us on the GDC Twitch channel today.

835
00:56:13,509 --> 00:56:14,950
We are thrilled to be joined by Martin.

836
00:56:15,770 --> 00:56:17,590
The game is No More Profit, published by No More Robots.

837
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:20,011
We forgot to disclose up front that No More Profot...

838
00:56:20,031 --> 00:56:20,511
No more...

839
00:56:21,371 --> 00:56:35,341
No where profit, which is published by No More Robots, is advised by Simon Carles, who

840
00:56:35,461 --> 00:56:41,465
is bossman, GDC bossman, vice president of GDC, blah blah blah.

841
00:56:41,485 --> 00:56:42,106
There's a connection.

842
00:56:42,366 --> 00:56:43,406
We forgot to mention out top.

843
00:56:43,426 --> 00:56:43,987
Sorry about that.

844
00:56:44,047 --> 00:56:48,450
He helped out on this game, so we would like to both give him credit and acknowledge.

845
00:56:49,191 --> 00:56:51,793
A, you know, disclosure. Disclosures are important.

846
00:56:52,013 --> 00:56:53,434
Um, uh...

847
00:56:53,474 --> 00:56:56,617
You spend a lot of time making sure my English isn't terrible in the event.

848
00:56:57,517 --> 00:57:00,180
Yeah, right on. Um, uh, we, uh...

849
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:03,542
Um, excuse me, I'm just gonna...

850
00:57:04,503 --> 00:57:09,307
Um, from there, we would also like to invite folks who are following us to, uh...

851
00:57:10,008 --> 00:57:13,530
Officially follow us to click on the follow button here on the GDC Twitch channel,

852
00:57:13,811 --> 00:57:16,513
because if you'd like other cool games that are coming out this year,

853
00:57:16,573 --> 00:57:18,475
there's a chance we might have an interview with the developers.

854
00:57:19,175 --> 00:57:23,518
We are working to talk to the folks behind Elsinore right now. I've reached out to talk to some folks behind

855
00:57:23,978 --> 00:57:26,680
hopefully games like Church in the Darkness and

856
00:57:27,981 --> 00:57:31,824
Oh God, there's another one that I'm actually trying to line up. Oh, yeah creature in the well creature in the well

857
00:57:31,884 --> 00:57:33,085
We're hopefully gonna have a stream with them

858
00:57:34,346 --> 00:57:35,727
and with that

859
00:57:36,467 --> 00:57:36,627
I'm

860
00:57:37,448 --> 00:57:38,449
Sweet good timing

861
00:57:39,509 --> 00:57:45,573
I'm going to actively wrap things up. Thank you everyone for watching. Thank for you for the question that we got from chat Alyssa

862
00:57:45,594 --> 00:57:48,055
Thank you for helping out and Martin as always. Thank you for joining us

863
00:57:49,093 --> 00:57:50,135

Thank you.

865
00:57:51,296 --> 00:57:52,498
Have a good day.

866
00:57:52,518 --> 00:57:52,578
Bye.

867
00:57:52,859 --> 00:57:53,500
Bye bye.
