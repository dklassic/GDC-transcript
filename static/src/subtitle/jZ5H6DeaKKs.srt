1
00:00:05,184 --> 00:00:06,644
All right, good afternoon, everybody.

2
00:00:07,744 --> 00:00:09,185
One quick reminder, turn off your phone,

3
00:00:09,205 --> 00:00:11,826
and then listen to me, and then turn your phone back on

4
00:00:12,006 --> 00:00:12,466
and rate me.

5
00:00:13,266 --> 00:00:14,767
I don't make the rules, I just follow them.

6
00:00:14,987 --> 00:00:15,447
That's all I do.

7
00:00:15,887 --> 00:00:17,108
Okay, so this is my talk.

8
00:00:17,928 --> 00:00:19,229
I'm just gonna call it email lists.

9
00:00:19,609 --> 00:00:20,389
That's what I wanted to call it,

10
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:21,729
but I knew nobody would wanna show up,

11
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,610
so thank you so much for attending this talk.

12
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:24,771
That sounds so boring,

13
00:00:24,831 --> 00:00:26,751
so I really commend all of you for showing up.

14
00:00:26,991 --> 00:00:28,032
I swear, I love this stuff.

15
00:00:28,452 --> 00:00:29,072
It's really fun.

16
00:00:29,472 --> 00:00:30,833
I hope you like it just as much as I do.

17
00:00:31,476 --> 00:00:34,677
OK, so I'm going to start the story Halloween 1989.

18
00:00:35,357 --> 00:00:35,857
That's me.

19
00:00:36,277 --> 00:00:37,017
I'm nine years old.

20
00:00:37,657 --> 00:00:39,038
My mom made my tunic.

21
00:00:39,878 --> 00:00:41,558
I'm Link, if you didn't guess.

22
00:00:41,658 --> 00:00:43,539
And my dad made my shield and my boomerang.

23
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:46,659
I was a total Nintendo kid growing up.

24
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,820
I was almost a brand representative.

25
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,681
And my Bible was Nintendo Power.

26
00:00:51,701 --> 00:00:54,581
And this is actually my original Nintendo Power, the one.

27
00:00:54,661 --> 00:00:57,882
I would just pour a big old bowl of cereal in the morning

28
00:00:58,062 --> 00:01:00,163
and then just spread that magazine open

29
00:01:00,183 --> 00:01:01,283
and play Nintendo all day.

30
00:01:01,991 --> 00:01:03,872
And let me tell you, I loved it.

31
00:01:05,712 --> 00:01:07,713
It inspired my early artistic abilities.

32
00:01:08,153 --> 00:01:11,414
Like, I actually, like, notice that I made her arm jet out.

33
00:01:11,494 --> 00:01:13,415
It was an artistic interpretation of Samus.

34
00:01:13,495 --> 00:01:14,795
It wasn't a straight up copy.

35
00:01:16,036 --> 00:01:18,297
But I grew up, and I became a UX designer.

36
00:01:18,357 --> 00:01:21,618
And I like to study how people use technology, what they find

37
00:01:21,678 --> 00:01:23,698
interesting about it, what they don't like about it.

38
00:01:24,859 --> 00:01:25,899
I also make my own games.

39
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:28,860
My latest one is the top left one, One Screen Platformer.

40
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,081
It's a platformer that takes place on one screen.

41
00:01:32,378 --> 00:01:33,458
I also write about marketing.

42
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:35,900
I tell you how to market a game on my website,

43
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,660
howtomarketagame.

44
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,541
I try and keep things super dead simple, guys.

45
00:01:39,402 --> 00:01:42,583
So I tried to fit it all down to 25 minutes.

46
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:43,984
They only gave me 25 minutes for this talk.

47
00:01:44,064 --> 00:01:44,664
I couldn't do it.

48
00:01:45,044 --> 00:01:46,865
So you can get the director's cut of these slides

49
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:50,928
at howtomarketagame.com slash GDC2019.

50
00:01:51,308 --> 00:01:52,508
All the slides are up there, even more.

51
00:01:53,089 --> 00:01:54,629
And you also get a free book if you go there.

52
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:55,990
I'm serious.

53
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:56,991
You'll get my free book.

54
00:01:57,711 --> 00:02:00,152
But now that I know all about marketing and technology

55
00:02:00,212 --> 00:02:00,993
and how to make a game.

56
00:02:02,813 --> 00:02:07,614
It occurs to me that Nintendo Power is just a giant advertisement targeting the 6-year-old

57
00:02:07,654 --> 00:02:09,074
to 16-year-old demographic.

58
00:02:09,494 --> 00:02:12,434
And I was marketed to my whole life with this book.

59
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:16,795
And you might say, God, this guy's life is a lie.

60
00:02:17,555 --> 00:02:19,396
And no, it wasn't.

61
00:02:19,436 --> 00:02:21,116
It was one of the best times of my life.

62
00:02:21,356 --> 00:02:24,257
And what I want to show you today is how to like...

63
00:02:24,657 --> 00:02:27,457
The reason that it was so good was they weren't always marketing to you.

64
00:02:27,537 --> 00:02:28,557
They were along for the ride.

65
00:02:28,757 --> 00:02:31,598
They enjoyed the stuff as much as I did.

66
00:02:31,973 --> 00:02:34,494
Like, they loved video games just as much as I did.

67
00:02:34,774 --> 00:02:35,894
And so what I want to teach you today

68
00:02:35,914 --> 00:02:39,116
is how to market your game so that a nine-year-old would

69
00:02:39,156 --> 00:02:39,836
want to draw it.

70
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,357
And that's what I'm here for.

71
00:02:42,437 --> 00:02:45,438
And you can't distribute magazines financially

72
00:02:45,658 --> 00:02:46,479
viably anymore.

73
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:48,920
But the next best thing is email marketing.

74
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,640
And I'm going to tell you today how that's going to work.

75
00:02:51,461 --> 00:02:52,521
But before I can get to the fun stuff,

76
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:54,122
I've got to start with the boring stuff, which is funnels.

77
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,063
I love postmortems, I read them all the time.

78
00:02:58,103 --> 00:03:02,691
This is a failed postmortem that was on Reddit, and the guy on Reddit said, this is a commenter

79
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:03,673
for this postmortem.

80
00:03:04,003 --> 00:03:06,024
He said, I thought they quietly canceled the project

81
00:03:06,245 --> 00:03:08,066
until I saw it on Steam the week it released.

82
00:03:08,246 --> 00:03:09,767
And you're thinking, oh, Andy Apocalypse.

83
00:03:10,308 --> 00:03:11,889
There it is, Andy Apocalypse.

84
00:03:12,589 --> 00:03:13,210
But it's not.

85
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:14,931
This is an age-old problem that we've

86
00:03:14,951 --> 00:03:16,892
been facing for hundreds of years.

87
00:03:17,133 --> 00:03:19,454
And this man, Elias St. Elmo Lewis,

88
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,836
wrote about this problem and how to solve it

89
00:03:22,837 --> 00:03:26,139
like way before television or the internet, radio,

90
00:03:26,259 --> 00:03:26,640
all of that.

91
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,903
His theories really influenced marketing today.

92
00:03:31,281 --> 00:03:32,923
And his most important contribution is this.

93
00:03:33,343 --> 00:03:34,344
It's called a sales funnel.

94
00:03:35,024 --> 00:03:36,846
And the thing about the sales funnel is,

95
00:03:38,047 --> 00:03:41,991
if you follow nothing I say today, you have to learn this.

96
00:03:42,531 --> 00:03:44,152
This is the most important thing you can learn

97
00:03:44,193 --> 00:03:47,415
because it's kind of like gravity or evolution.

98
00:03:47,756 --> 00:03:48,817
Even if you don't believe it,

99
00:03:49,277 --> 00:03:50,578
you are affected by this thing.

100
00:03:51,059 --> 00:03:53,421
So basically what a sales funnel is,

101
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:55,563
is it just marks, it's a mental model

102
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:57,384
of how people interface with your product

103
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:58,645
as they get down the funnel.

104
00:03:59,311 --> 00:03:59,892
as they learn about it.

105
00:03:59,932 --> 00:04:02,954
So it goes from awareness, to interest, to desire,

106
00:04:03,114 --> 00:04:05,896
to finally taking action, which is just buying your game.

107
00:04:07,177 --> 00:04:09,759
And I'm going to kind of chart the progression of somebody's

108
00:04:09,779 --> 00:04:11,841
face using this other magazine from my childhood, which

109
00:04:11,881 --> 00:04:12,701
was GameProMag.

110
00:04:13,702 --> 00:04:15,083
They use these characters to rate people.

111
00:04:15,904 --> 00:04:18,666
And the reason it's called a funnel is when somebody finds

112
00:04:18,726 --> 00:04:20,167
out about you, it's like they're being poured

113
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:22,289
onto the top of the funnel, and they kind of trickle down

114
00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:22,789
to the bottom.

115
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,031
And so I'm going to just, the easiest way to explain

116
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:27,032
is actually just a story.

117
00:04:27,746 --> 00:04:30,227
So let's pretend this whole room, we're all together.

118
00:04:30,247 --> 00:04:32,948
This is about the team size of making a modern RTS, I believe.

119
00:04:33,348 --> 00:04:34,889
So we're all making an RTS together.

120
00:04:35,429 --> 00:04:39,911
And we are making this RTS for this person A.

121
00:04:39,991 --> 00:04:42,452
She's just somebody out there who doesn't know we exist.

122
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:43,532
But she likes RTSes.

123
00:04:43,552 --> 00:04:44,933
She played them in her childhood and everything.

124
00:04:46,533 --> 00:04:48,534
But luckily, we got caught up by Kotaku.

125
00:04:48,574 --> 00:04:50,575
And they wrote a glowing preview of our game.

126
00:04:50,595 --> 00:04:51,435
We haven't released it yet.

127
00:04:51,876 --> 00:04:53,236
And she reads Kotaku every day.

128
00:04:53,316 --> 00:04:54,096
And she sees it.

129
00:04:54,437 --> 00:04:55,997
And so she becomes aware of our game.

130
00:04:56,676 --> 00:04:58,438
And she reads the article and clicks the link that's

131
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:01,460
provided to our website, where she reads an FAQ.

132
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,841
And she learns about that game.

133
00:05:02,881 --> 00:05:04,463
She realizes this is an RTS.

134
00:05:04,543 --> 00:05:05,584
It's just what I like.

135
00:05:06,064 --> 00:05:07,325
This is interesting.

136
00:05:07,665 --> 00:05:08,886
So she's now in the interest phase.

137
00:05:09,807 --> 00:05:12,149
She finds out on our FAQ that we have a Twitch stream.

138
00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:14,431
We stream three times a week on the money.

139
00:05:14,992 --> 00:05:18,355
And we talk about DPS, and what the units, and the strategies,

140
00:05:18,395 --> 00:05:18,895
and the maps.

141
00:05:18,935 --> 00:05:19,996
And she learns all about it.

142
00:05:20,036 --> 00:05:21,337
She watches it all the time.

143
00:05:22,421 --> 00:05:23,342
And she desires it now.

144
00:05:23,382 --> 00:05:26,344
She thinks about this game on her breaks, on her commute.

145
00:05:26,405 --> 00:05:27,966
She's like, this is my game.

146
00:05:28,066 --> 00:05:28,847
I desire it.

147
00:05:28,867 --> 00:05:29,747
I want this game.

148
00:05:30,268 --> 00:05:33,050
And then on the last day before we go live,

149
00:05:33,411 --> 00:05:35,733
we do a 24-hour stream-a-thon.

150
00:05:35,813 --> 00:05:37,634
All of us buy matching suits, and we're

151
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:39,716
doing something cool on the stream.

152
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,978
And every half an hour, we say, go buy the game.

153
00:05:42,038 --> 00:05:42,599
Go buy the game.

154
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:44,961
And because she knew us, she learned who we are,

155
00:05:45,321 --> 00:05:48,624
and she liked us, she went and bought it right away, day one.

156
00:05:49,585 --> 00:05:49,925
That's it.

157
00:05:50,352 --> 00:05:51,413
checkpoint.

158
00:05:52,293 --> 00:05:52,993
We had something.

159
00:05:53,013 --> 00:05:54,613
The reason this worked so well was

160
00:05:54,653 --> 00:05:58,194
we had something for her at every level of the funnel.

161
00:05:58,214 --> 00:06:00,295
We had a little piece of marketing everywhere.

162
00:06:00,315 --> 00:06:02,476
We got her in the top with PR.

163
00:06:03,236 --> 00:06:05,237
Then we piqued her interest with our FAQ.

164
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:08,097
We used Twitch to heighten the desire of the game.

165
00:06:08,357 --> 00:06:10,818
And then we had a launch stream to do the call to action

166
00:06:10,838 --> 00:06:11,438
to say go buy it.

167
00:06:13,059 --> 00:06:15,099
Now, the most important thing is everybody

168
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:16,160
talks about visibility.

169
00:06:17,136 --> 00:06:19,698
Seeing somebody on Steam and then going by the game

170
00:06:19,938 --> 00:06:20,899
right away doesn't happen.

171
00:06:21,059 --> 00:06:22,300
Nobody just sees it and buys it.

172
00:06:23,581 --> 00:06:25,122
It's like the only time that happens

173
00:06:25,182 --> 00:06:26,383
is gum at the checkout aisle.

174
00:06:26,723 --> 00:06:29,005
And that thing costs a dollar, and it's covered in sugar.

175
00:06:29,325 --> 00:06:31,607
It's the only time somebody sees something and then buys it.

176
00:06:32,928 --> 00:06:35,210
Exposure does not equal sales.

177
00:06:36,831 --> 00:06:38,232
And that's exactly what happened here

178
00:06:38,252 --> 00:06:40,134
with this Reddit commenter on that failed postmortem.

179
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:42,155
Basically, they knew about it.

180
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,017
They heard about the game, and they followed it a little bit.

181
00:06:44,277 --> 00:06:45,838
But then the developers dropped off,

182
00:06:45,858 --> 00:06:46,358
and they didn't follow it.

183
00:06:46,962 --> 00:06:49,403
keep contact, and so they fell up.

184
00:06:49,503 --> 00:06:52,285
This person just lost interest and never bought the game.

185
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:55,266
And why you need to think in funnels is like,

186
00:06:55,486 --> 00:06:57,067
this week you are gonna be like bombarded

187
00:06:57,127 --> 00:06:58,488
with so much information,

188
00:06:58,768 --> 00:07:00,229
there's no way you could do it all.

189
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:02,290
So what you should do is you should classify

190
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,512
this information about where it lives on the funnel.

191
00:07:04,532 --> 00:07:06,433
Like, oh, this is definitely a top of the funnel

192
00:07:06,513 --> 00:07:08,674
type of advice, or this is bottom of the funnel advice.

193
00:07:08,954 --> 00:07:10,255
It helps you just kind of like organize

194
00:07:10,295 --> 00:07:11,115
your marketing schemes.

195
00:07:12,755 --> 00:07:17,017
So, you know, we all know streamers and tweet a lot for the top. That's perfect top of the funnel stuff

196
00:07:17,057 --> 00:07:20,999
But what goes in the bottom here? Like what's the best way to do these bottom three funnel activities?

197
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:26,981
What am I actually going to show you is that email actually really fits this very well to do these bottom three

198
00:07:28,462 --> 00:07:32,623
So let's get into the fun stuff. This is where like this is this is the good stuff. Okay, let's go. All right

199
00:07:33,534 --> 00:07:35,695
First off, if you guys are streaming out the door,

200
00:07:35,715 --> 00:07:36,635
this is not spam.

201
00:07:36,675 --> 00:07:38,575
I'm not saying we all become spammers or something.

202
00:07:39,075 --> 00:07:40,255
Spam is totally different.

203
00:07:40,275 --> 00:07:41,196
This is from Wikipedia.

204
00:07:41,616 --> 00:07:44,436
Spam is unsolicited, where they just scrape your email address

205
00:07:44,536 --> 00:07:47,137
off a website, and then they send you tons of emails.

206
00:07:47,177 --> 00:07:48,897
And then hopefully, one person will accidentally

207
00:07:48,937 --> 00:07:50,477
give away their bank account, and then we

208
00:07:50,497 --> 00:07:50,957
steal all their money.

209
00:07:50,997 --> 00:07:51,497
That's spam.

210
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,198
That is not what we're suggesting here.

211
00:07:54,118 --> 00:07:56,438
It's also not emailing the press.

212
00:07:56,478 --> 00:07:57,438
A lot of people confuse that.

213
00:07:58,219 --> 00:08:00,259
Yes, if you market to the press using email,

214
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:00,659
that's spam.

215
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:03,570
just marketing, but this is something totally different.

216
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:08,114
This is where regular fans will join your mailing list,

217
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:09,495
and it's all about consent.

218
00:08:09,976 --> 00:08:11,937
They choose to give you their email address,

219
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:13,238
and you contact them.

220
00:08:14,239 --> 00:08:16,381
And then if they ever don't like your message,

221
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:18,663
they can unsubscribe, and you just never, ever, ever

222
00:08:18,703 --> 00:08:19,363
contact them again.

223
00:08:19,764 --> 00:08:21,085
Again, it's all about permission.

224
00:08:21,225 --> 00:08:22,686
Sometimes it's called permission marketing,

225
00:08:23,106 --> 00:08:25,128
because they opt into your message.

226
00:08:26,529 --> 00:08:28,651
And typically, it's run on stuff like MailChimp, ConvertKit.

227
00:08:29,111 --> 00:08:29,972
These softwares are your

228
00:08:31,685 --> 00:08:33,566
typical mailing list providers.

229
00:08:34,167 --> 00:08:35,708
And you might say, OK, well, I use Twitter.

230
00:08:36,569 --> 00:08:37,830
I'm doing pretty much the same thing with Twitter.

231
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:41,793
And so here's four reasons why email is so totally awesome

232
00:08:42,134 --> 00:08:43,114
and much better than social media.

233
00:08:44,115 --> 00:08:47,158
Number one is you are not dependent on a big corporation

234
00:08:47,198 --> 00:08:49,600
to talk to your followers.

235
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,042
25 years ago, these were the hottest websites

236
00:08:52,082 --> 00:08:53,383
for talking to your fans.

237
00:08:53,844 --> 00:08:55,805
And if you built up a huge following on here,

238
00:08:56,086 --> 00:08:58,428
you lost all your money and all that effort

239
00:08:58,448 --> 00:08:59,328
to build up a fan base.

240
00:09:00,293 --> 00:09:03,475
And if you think like Facebook and Twitter are huge now and they're indestructible,

241
00:09:03,795 --> 00:09:07,518
they are highly toxic and they have a very rough user base.

242
00:09:07,898 --> 00:09:13,602
And your following could turn out to be turned off by those controversial messages that are being put out there.

243
00:09:14,443 --> 00:09:15,323
And it's happening today.

244
00:09:15,383 --> 00:09:20,807
Like Tumblr just changed the way they censor images and the way they allow people to post stuff.

245
00:09:22,093 --> 00:09:23,114
people are fleeing Tumblr.

246
00:09:23,434 --> 00:09:25,236
And just today, I actually just added this slide,

247
00:09:25,616 --> 00:09:28,878
MySpace just deleted 12 years of music,

248
00:09:29,219 --> 00:09:31,100
oops, through some database migration.

249
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,242
What a dumpster fire of all everybody's music

250
00:09:33,282 --> 00:09:34,623
that they posted on MySpace.

251
00:09:35,663 --> 00:09:38,946
Basically, don't let corporations control your fan base.

252
00:09:39,266 --> 00:09:39,926
You should do that,

253
00:09:40,047 --> 00:09:41,568
and you can do that through email marketing.

254
00:09:42,468 --> 00:09:44,069
Number two is, and this is counterintuitive,

255
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:46,811
social media actually isn't good at getting your fans to act.

256
00:09:48,084 --> 00:09:50,546
OK, so a marketing research firm surveyed

257
00:09:50,566 --> 00:09:52,227
a whole bunch of different companies

258
00:09:52,287 --> 00:09:53,708
and how their outreach did.

259
00:09:54,008 --> 00:09:56,690
And they averaged all their different communications

260
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:57,870
based on response rates.

261
00:09:58,371 --> 00:10:01,412
And the way this graph works is, if you theoretically

262
00:10:01,593 --> 00:10:04,855
had 2,000 followers on Twitter, 2,000 Facebook followers,

263
00:10:05,035 --> 00:10:07,416
2,000 email list followers, and you just sent a message,

264
00:10:08,277 --> 00:10:10,898
how many of those people would actually see that message?

265
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:13,200
On average, only 40 of those 2,000

266
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,941
would actually see it through Twitter.

267
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,660
Whereas email gets about 435.

268
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,561
Again, this is an average.

269
00:10:19,021 --> 00:10:21,742
And you're thinking, well, that's general marketing.

270
00:10:21,802 --> 00:10:23,323
It's probably for insurance and stuff.

271
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:24,664
These are video games.

272
00:10:24,684 --> 00:10:25,984
This is a young audience.

273
00:10:26,304 --> 00:10:28,905
They're engaged, technologically advanced.

274
00:10:29,326 --> 00:10:30,766
It's not going to affect video games.

275
00:10:31,747 --> 00:10:32,867
So I wanted to test this there.

276
00:10:32,887 --> 00:10:33,547
I had the same thought.

277
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:36,309
So I found this guy, Pixel Jam Games.

278
00:10:36,609 --> 00:10:37,949
Go check out his game, Dino Run 2.

279
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,230
He ran a successful Kickstarter last year.

280
00:10:41,826 --> 00:10:45,848
And the cool thing about him, the reason that's so interesting is he was so dedicated.

281
00:10:45,908 --> 00:10:51,471
He emailed his list and tweeted at the exact same time on the exact same day with the same

282
00:10:51,511 --> 00:10:52,952
call to action and the same images.

283
00:10:53,292 --> 00:10:54,893
It was like the guy was like a machine.

284
00:10:55,493 --> 00:11:01,916
And going into his Kickstarter campaign, he had 24,000 Twitter followers and 16,000 email

285
00:11:01,936 --> 00:11:04,738
subscribers, almost half as many email subscribers.

286
00:11:04,758 --> 00:11:05,318
Just keep that in mind.

287
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:07,199
So this is what happened.

288
00:11:07,239 --> 00:11:10,561
He emailed his list five times during his Kickstarter campaign.

289
00:11:11,032 --> 00:11:11,873
This is the first email.

290
00:11:12,614 --> 00:11:16,417
These are the number of clicks his messaging got.

291
00:11:17,117 --> 00:11:18,999
It's like an order of magnitude higher for email.

292
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,121
And it just continues on from that way.

293
00:11:21,161 --> 00:11:23,983
This is throughout this campaign of all the emails and tweets

294
00:11:24,003 --> 00:11:24,444
that he sent.

295
00:11:25,825 --> 00:11:26,605
It's not even close.

296
00:11:26,665 --> 00:11:29,948
It's not like, hey, if you just add some emojis to that Twitter,

297
00:11:30,008 --> 00:11:31,309
it's going to really pop it up there.

298
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:35,413
Like, it's an order of magnitude lower, the number of clicks

299
00:11:35,453 --> 00:11:37,675
that he got from Twitter versus email.

300
00:11:38,976 --> 00:11:39,576
And number three.

301
00:11:40,576 --> 00:11:41,917
you just have more functionality.

302
00:11:42,758 --> 00:11:44,719
When you use Twitter, you're just like barking out

303
00:11:44,779 --> 00:11:47,000
to all people at all levels of the funnel.

304
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:49,582
Whereas email, you can control your message.

305
00:11:50,503 --> 00:11:52,224
And the best example of this is this indie studio

306
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:53,345
called Butterscotch Shenanigans.

307
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:54,866
They've released tons of games.

308
00:11:55,526 --> 00:11:57,287
And they had something really smart, like, OK,

309
00:11:57,307 --> 00:11:58,688
Crashlands was a big hit for them.

310
00:11:59,217 --> 00:12:01,738
But they had tons of earlier games that were not as popular.

311
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:03,579
So they had this brilliant idea.

312
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,502
And what they did was they created this secret unlockable

313
00:12:07,542 --> 00:12:09,503
side quest where you could unlock characters

314
00:12:09,543 --> 00:12:11,245
from their old games in crash lands.

315
00:12:11,945 --> 00:12:13,986
And what the idea was that it would encourage people

316
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:15,868
to go get that other game.

317
00:12:16,308 --> 00:12:18,449
And of all the people that, then they ran this experiment.

318
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,050
And what they did was for everybody

319
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:21,932
that found this hidden character,

320
00:12:22,232 --> 00:12:24,593
half they got an in-game notification that, hey,

321
00:12:24,633 --> 00:12:26,695
this character is from one of our other games.

322
00:12:27,215 --> 00:12:28,336
The other half of the audience.

323
00:12:28,937 --> 00:12:29,657
they emailed him.

324
00:12:30,077 --> 00:12:31,117
And this email was awesome.

325
00:12:31,857 --> 00:12:33,378
This email contained a description

326
00:12:33,398 --> 00:12:35,418
of who the character was, a description of the game

327
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:37,959
that this character starred in, which was Quadruped's Rampage,

328
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:40,019
and then at the very bottom, a link

329
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:41,119
to go get it from the store.

330
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,520
And what they found after this little experiment,

331
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:47,601
an emailed player was 2.8 times more likely to go get the game.

332
00:12:50,682 --> 00:12:52,842
And what happens is, you're basically

333
00:12:52,882 --> 00:12:55,043
taking somebody from the bottom of the funnel of one game

334
00:12:55,403 --> 00:12:57,783
and just transfusing it like blood over to game B.

335
00:12:58,887 --> 00:13:01,247
Like that, you don't have to worry about getting top

336
00:13:01,267 --> 00:13:02,808
of the funnel, moving them all the way down.

337
00:13:03,108 --> 00:13:05,469
It's a lot easier to move an existing fan

338
00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:06,549
over to your next game.

339
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,710
Number four is real simple,

340
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:09,630
I'm just gonna go through this real fast.

341
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:11,471
Install base, like everybody's got email.

342
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:13,732
You actually need an email address to sign up for Twitter

343
00:13:13,872 --> 00:13:15,372
and for Facebook and for Steam.

344
00:13:15,732 --> 00:13:16,633
Everybody's got an email address.

345
00:13:16,653 --> 00:13:17,413
There's no way they can say,

346
00:13:17,433 --> 00:13:19,013
well I don't use Twitter or something.

347
00:13:20,314 --> 00:13:21,834
Okay, so I know I'm pitching for email here,

348
00:13:21,874 --> 00:13:23,275
but it sounded pretty good for email.

349
00:13:23,295 --> 00:13:26,036
Like there's a lot going on emails column here.

350
00:13:26,776 --> 00:13:28,697
I'll give virality to social media.

351
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:31,516
But remember, virality is a very top of the funnel thing.

352
00:13:31,716 --> 00:13:33,237
It's like even if you get tons of exposure,

353
00:13:33,257 --> 00:13:34,938
everybody's retweeting it, they're still just

354
00:13:35,078 --> 00:13:35,718
at the top of the funnel.

355
00:13:35,738 --> 00:13:37,279
They haven't found interest in your game yet.

356
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,520
And we're all game designers here.

357
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,581
And what's a dominant strategy?

358
00:13:41,681 --> 00:13:43,261
It's that thing where it's that awesome sword

359
00:13:43,301 --> 00:13:45,622
that all players go to just because it's so overpowered.

360
00:13:46,062 --> 00:13:48,563
Email is that overpowered dominant strategy.

361
00:13:49,084 --> 00:13:50,904
And we don't get a lot of breaks as indies.

362
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:53,325
And when we get just a little bit of a break,

363
00:13:53,626 --> 00:13:54,526
we should double down on it.

364
00:13:55,426 --> 00:13:56,827
So let me show you how to actually use it and take

365
00:13:56,847 --> 00:13:57,307
advantage of this.

366
00:13:58,158 --> 00:13:59,619
And the way you do it is you actually

367
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:02,342
should treat email like it's your fan club.

368
00:14:02,622 --> 00:14:05,045
Your biggest fans should be on your email list,

369
00:14:05,165 --> 00:14:07,127
and you should treat them like the prince and princesses

370
00:14:07,227 --> 00:14:07,748
that they are.

371
00:14:08,909 --> 00:14:11,952
So a basic three-step process to work your email list.

372
00:14:12,372 --> 00:14:14,134
You drive traffic to your list, you

373
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:15,435
build a relationship with that list,

374
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:16,937
and then you market your game.

375
00:14:18,218 --> 00:14:19,419
So let's drive traffic to this list.

376
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:20,320
Again.

377
00:14:20,632 --> 00:14:22,773
You use social media, which is like very top of the funnel,

378
00:14:23,054 --> 00:14:24,074
and you drive them to the list.

379
00:14:24,735 --> 00:14:26,515
But how do you get them actually joined?

380
00:14:27,016 --> 00:14:28,236
If you look on a lot of websites,

381
00:14:28,256 --> 00:14:31,698
you see this little tiny thing at the very, very bottom

382
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,559
of their web page.

383
00:14:33,719 --> 00:14:35,320
It's this little tiny box, like we're afraid of it.

384
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,741
Like, newsletter.

385
00:14:38,142 --> 00:14:39,563
Nobody is going to put anything in there.

386
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:40,823
They don't know what's going on in there.

387
00:14:42,263 --> 00:14:44,285
The other thing I see are a lot of noble devs

388
00:14:44,865 --> 00:14:46,226
that say these pronouncements like,

389
00:14:46,587 --> 00:14:49,549
I only email you when I have a new game.

390
00:14:49,569 --> 00:14:52,232
And it sounds noble, like, oh, thanks, dude.

391
00:14:52,652 --> 00:14:55,094
But remember, the people who give you their email address

392
00:14:55,414 --> 00:14:55,815
love you.

393
00:14:56,115 --> 00:14:57,816
They absolutely adore you.

394
00:14:58,257 --> 00:14:59,458
It's like, what if you met a cool person

395
00:14:59,478 --> 00:15:00,439
and you gave them their phone number?

396
00:15:00,459 --> 00:15:02,000
And you gave the phone number, and you're like, hey,

397
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,081
let's hang out this weekend.

398
00:15:03,141 --> 00:15:03,641
Isn't that cool?

399
00:15:03,902 --> 00:15:05,203
And they said, no, I'm only going

400
00:15:05,223 --> 00:15:07,004
to call you when I need $20.

401
00:15:08,245 --> 00:15:09,787
And you're like, what the fuck?

402
00:15:11,365 --> 00:15:12,946
No, you're cool, let's hang out next weekend.

403
00:15:13,306 --> 00:15:13,827
No, no, no, no.

404
00:15:14,207 --> 00:15:15,568
You don't know when you're gonna hear from me.

405
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,410
It could be six months, could be a year, two years.

406
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:17,850
You don't know.

407
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,091
Then you're gonna get it.

408
00:15:19,431 --> 00:15:19,792
It's $20.

409
00:15:20,532 --> 00:15:21,473
That's all you're gonna hear from me.

410
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:23,454
It's like, who would be that weird friend?

411
00:15:23,895 --> 00:15:25,236
Don't do that to your fan club.

412
00:15:26,517 --> 00:15:28,679
The way you actually get people to join your email list

413
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:29,719
is with a lead magnet.

414
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,321
And it's just a little tiny freebie

415
00:15:31,501 --> 00:15:32,922
that you give in exchange for an email address.

416
00:15:33,102 --> 00:15:34,443
And you're thinking, bait and switch?

417
00:15:34,663 --> 00:15:35,684
Nuh-uh, no way.

418
00:15:36,465 --> 00:15:37,706
Who falls for that stupid stuff?

419
00:15:38,426 --> 00:15:38,506
No.

420
00:15:39,723 --> 00:15:42,025
If you've ever been to an office and worked in an office,

421
00:15:42,065 --> 00:15:43,367
the most popular person in the office

422
00:15:43,407 --> 00:15:45,489
was always the one with the candy jar on their desk.

423
00:15:45,549 --> 00:15:47,391
And the reason they were so sociable and popular

424
00:15:47,752 --> 00:15:48,653
was it's an icebreaker.

425
00:15:49,013 --> 00:15:49,754
I did that myself.

426
00:15:49,774 --> 00:15:51,636
Like, I'd go up and, I kind of want some candy today.

427
00:15:52,016 --> 00:15:53,898
And then I'd kind of get in conversation.

428
00:15:53,938 --> 00:15:55,180
I realized they're actually a cool person

429
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,221
and I enjoy their company.

430
00:15:57,182 --> 00:15:57,822
It's the same thing.

431
00:15:58,483 --> 00:16:00,505
Discoverability, and there's a whole discoverability day

432
00:16:00,545 --> 00:16:00,786
tomorrow.

433
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,690
The biggest gap in game marketing

434
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,730
is not visibility and discoverability.

435
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:05,971
It's actually the interest.

436
00:16:06,431 --> 00:16:09,431
And all a lead Mac does is bridge that giant gap

437
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,752
from somebody being aware of your game

438
00:16:11,032 --> 00:16:11,952
to being interested in it.

439
00:16:12,152 --> 00:16:13,872
It just gets it over that little awkward period.

440
00:16:15,193 --> 00:16:16,193
So here's a couple examples.

441
00:16:16,993 --> 00:16:19,013
Strayfawn Studios, they released the game Nimbatas.

442
00:16:19,414 --> 00:16:20,554
And what they did was a demo.

443
00:16:20,874 --> 00:16:22,614
And to get on the demo, you just signed up.

444
00:16:22,634 --> 00:16:24,074
You just gave your email address and you got on the demo.

445
00:16:24,255 --> 00:16:24,615
That's it.

446
00:16:24,795 --> 00:16:27,275
They got 50,000 subscribers to their mailing list

447
00:16:27,315 --> 00:16:27,835
because of that.

448
00:16:28,713 --> 00:16:30,394
You can also do stuff like give away your soundtrack.

449
00:16:30,414 --> 00:16:33,155
Say, hey, if you like our music, I'll email it to you.

450
00:16:33,175 --> 00:16:34,075
Just give me your email address.

451
00:16:35,535 --> 00:16:36,576
You can also do it within your game.

452
00:16:36,896 --> 00:16:39,556
In my game, Zombie King, all my bonus levels,

453
00:16:39,596 --> 00:16:40,957
where you got all this awesome gold,

454
00:16:41,537 --> 00:16:43,437
it was only available to subscribers of the email list.

455
00:16:43,657 --> 00:16:45,858
And it was hugely popular, and people signed up for it.

456
00:16:46,198 --> 00:16:48,139
It's like a special thing just for subscribers.

457
00:16:49,419 --> 00:16:50,899
OK, so you drove traffic to your list.

458
00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:52,360
Let's build a relationship with them.

459
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,720
And the way you do this is with an autoresponder.

460
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,741
And an autoresponder is built into anything

461
00:16:56,781 --> 00:16:57,261
on Mailchimp.

462
00:16:57,863 --> 00:16:59,324
or any other service provider.

463
00:16:59,764 --> 00:17:04,926
And all it is is just a programmed set of emails

464
00:17:04,966 --> 00:17:05,726
that you pre-write.

465
00:17:06,547 --> 00:17:09,188
And so when somebody joins a list on, let's say, Sunday,

466
00:17:09,668 --> 00:17:11,689
email one is automatically sent to them on Monday.

467
00:17:12,229 --> 00:17:14,870
And then you can program it so email two is sent on Tuesday,

468
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,371
and email three is sent on Wednesday.

469
00:17:16,671 --> 00:17:18,712
And you can change the duration, and you can program it.

470
00:17:18,732 --> 00:17:19,973
It's like writing dialogue trees.

471
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,041
And what you do is this is how you introduce yourself.

472
00:17:23,401 --> 00:17:26,123
Like one email might just be welcome.

473
00:17:26,183 --> 00:17:27,725
Another one might be tips for your game.

474
00:17:27,825 --> 00:17:29,206
And then you talk about your company.

475
00:17:29,446 --> 00:17:30,747
Another email might be about you.

476
00:17:31,207 --> 00:17:32,949
It just slowly introduces people.

477
00:17:33,389 --> 00:17:35,551
And this is kind of like Game of Thrones.

478
00:17:35,591 --> 00:17:38,253
Like I didn't get into it till like the fifth season

479
00:17:38,273 --> 00:17:39,534
or fourth, I don't know how many there are.

480
00:17:40,314 --> 00:17:42,976
I went back and I re-watched all the episodes

481
00:17:43,056 --> 00:17:44,257
in like one epic month.

482
00:17:45,158 --> 00:17:46,299
It's your autoresponders like that.

483
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:48,785
People probably are finding you for the first time.

484
00:17:48,865 --> 00:17:50,585
Even though you released tons of games before,

485
00:17:51,126 --> 00:17:53,506
your autoresponder will slowly introduce people.

486
00:17:53,546 --> 00:17:55,647
You can use it to say, hey, this was my game

487
00:17:55,687 --> 00:17:56,467
I released four years ago.

488
00:17:56,487 --> 00:17:57,727
This is my game I released two years ago.

489
00:17:58,087 --> 00:17:59,727
You can slowly introduce who you are

490
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:00,948
and catch them up so that they're

491
00:18:00,988 --> 00:18:03,208
current with everybody else that's a fan of your games.

492
00:18:04,268 --> 00:18:06,329
And you might think, oh my god, that's a ton of emails.

493
00:18:06,369 --> 00:18:07,529
Who would ever open all that?

494
00:18:07,969 --> 00:18:10,110
This is my autoresponder for Zombie King.

495
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,350
My most opened email is that one.

496
00:18:14,296 --> 00:18:15,537
When you have an autoresponder,

497
00:18:15,557 --> 00:18:17,318
you're slowly building a relationship with people

498
00:18:17,598 --> 00:18:19,199
and they like you more and more and more

499
00:18:19,239 --> 00:18:20,340
by the end of the autoresponder.

500
00:18:22,121 --> 00:18:24,402
So that's why, that's how you get people down the funnel.

501
00:18:24,462 --> 00:18:27,224
Your autoresponder hits the interest, desire,

502
00:18:27,244 --> 00:18:27,964
and action phase.

503
00:18:28,285 --> 00:18:29,225
That's what it's built for.

504
00:18:30,846 --> 00:18:33,648
So, okay, we drove traffic to our mailing list,

505
00:18:33,688 --> 00:18:35,329
got them to sign up, we built that relationship,

506
00:18:35,629 --> 00:18:36,430
now it's time to market.

507
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:38,391
Let's fucking sell, sell, sell.

508
00:18:38,431 --> 00:18:41,252
Let's get them for every penny that you've got.

509
00:18:41,332 --> 00:18:43,254
Just dig in, drop the money bomb.

510
00:18:43,274 --> 00:18:43,314
No.

511
00:18:44,698 --> 00:18:47,080
Do not cash out on your mailing list.

512
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:47,880
Do not.

513
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,361
You built a relationship with these people,

514
00:18:49,441 --> 00:18:50,641
and you've got to be gentle with them.

515
00:18:51,321 --> 00:18:53,502
So we practice something called give, give, give, ask.

516
00:18:54,183 --> 00:18:56,984
And basically what it is, is for every one email

517
00:18:57,024 --> 00:18:58,785
that you send that says, go buy our game,

518
00:18:58,825 --> 00:19:01,686
or it's on sale, that's called action, you do all but.

519
00:19:01,986 --> 00:19:03,907
You have at least done three other emails

520
00:19:04,107 --> 00:19:07,048
that are just content, just interesting stories.

521
00:19:07,388 --> 00:19:08,949
They don't even have a link to go buy anything.

522
00:19:08,969 --> 00:19:09,789
They're just cool stuff.

523
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:12,450
And this is the way you should treat your mailing list.

524
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:13,511
You're just this little present.

525
00:19:14,324 --> 00:19:17,546
wizard who's dropping presents to all the boys and girls.

526
00:19:17,586 --> 00:19:19,547
Like, that guy's in the desire phase right there.

527
00:19:19,567 --> 00:19:21,008
That's what you do.

528
00:19:21,048 --> 00:19:22,809
That is what your mailing list should look like.

529
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,751
And this is exactly what Nintendo Power did.

530
00:19:25,811 --> 00:19:27,732
Like, all their stuff is like comics.

531
00:19:27,752 --> 00:19:28,613
They had maps.

532
00:19:28,673 --> 00:19:30,214
They had cheat codes.

533
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:32,795
And like, that middle map of Metroid

534
00:19:32,835 --> 00:19:33,996
is what sold me on the game.

535
00:19:34,056 --> 00:19:36,097
Like, somewhere in there is something called an ice beam.

536
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:37,738
I didn't even know what an ice beam was,

537
00:19:37,758 --> 00:19:38,859
but I knew I had to have that game,

538
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:41,040
because somewhere in that game, I could find the ice beam.

539
00:19:41,601 --> 00:19:43,622
Like, that is what sells people on their game.

540
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:46,565
And a perfect example of this is what

541
00:19:46,605 --> 00:19:48,927
Kit Fox did for their Boyfriend Dungeon Kickstarter

542
00:19:49,027 --> 00:19:49,788
on their email campaign.

543
00:19:50,168 --> 00:19:52,350
Now, full disclosure, I consulted with them

544
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,871
on how to do this for their Kickstarter.

545
00:19:54,591 --> 00:19:57,473
But what they did was, it's a game about dating weapons

546
00:19:57,553 --> 00:19:58,574
and dungeon fighting.

547
00:19:59,255 --> 00:20:01,036
But the most attractive thing, of course,

548
00:20:01,316 --> 00:20:02,577
are the dateable weapons.

549
00:20:03,177 --> 00:20:07,140
And so what they did was, they did a series of weekly emails

550
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,162
written by each of the dateable weapons.

551
00:20:09,722 --> 00:20:11,904
And each week, you got a different love letter

552
00:20:11,984 --> 00:20:12,664
from each one.

553
00:20:12,804 --> 00:20:13,885
And it told about that.

554
00:20:14,312 --> 00:20:17,513
that weapon, it told their back story, it told about the game,

555
00:20:17,873 --> 00:20:20,533
it slowly built it up in the story of them

556
00:20:21,133 --> 00:20:22,834
from the standpoint, from the viewpoint

557
00:20:23,114 --> 00:20:24,074
of these datable weapons.

558
00:20:24,954 --> 00:20:27,114
So each one was just luxurious.

559
00:20:27,715 --> 00:20:29,155
And here are the results of that.

560
00:20:29,775 --> 00:20:33,156
Dear KidFox, their community manager, Victoria,

561
00:20:33,336 --> 00:20:36,236
got this email from one of the subscribers to the mail list.

562
00:20:36,716 --> 00:20:39,177
I signed up for the newsletter and I never got the Isaac one,

563
00:20:39,497 --> 00:20:41,977
and I would like to because I love these character

564
00:20:42,057 --> 00:20:42,537
love letters.

565
00:20:43,232 --> 00:20:44,772
So could I maybe be re-sent one?

566
00:20:45,672 --> 00:20:48,513
Show of hands, has anybody ever received an email

567
00:20:48,673 --> 00:20:50,133
asking to be marketed to more?

568
00:20:50,293 --> 00:20:54,094
Like, does somebody say, please tweet at me, more tweets?

569
00:20:54,575 --> 00:20:55,035
Like, no.

570
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:58,616
But if you write this in an engaging way, people love it,

571
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:01,276
and they will engage with you and your content.

572
00:21:02,417 --> 00:21:04,817
And I mean, one, that's pretty hot.

573
00:21:04,917 --> 00:21:05,857
Like, that is totally hot.

574
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:08,498
When St. Elmo Lewis was talking about the desire phase,

575
00:21:09,478 --> 00:21:10,259
he had no idea.

576
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:14,211
This is pretty amazing stuff, right?

577
00:21:14,591 --> 00:21:16,172
OK, so this is your fan club.

578
00:21:16,392 --> 00:21:16,772
Treat it one.

579
00:21:16,952 --> 00:21:19,654
And the biggest myth people ever said,

580
00:21:19,674 --> 00:21:21,656
the biggest tale the devil ever told

581
00:21:21,696 --> 00:21:22,976
was that people don't want your email.

582
00:21:24,337 --> 00:21:25,898
I get emails all the time from indies that are like,

583
00:21:25,978 --> 00:21:26,899
a very rare dispatch.

584
00:21:26,999 --> 00:21:28,780
Or I hope you don't mind getting this email.

585
00:21:29,081 --> 00:21:30,682
Or I'm invading your inbox once again.

586
00:21:31,662 --> 00:21:34,284
This is the emails that Kit Fox crew

587
00:21:34,324 --> 00:21:35,165
sent for their Kickstarter.

588
00:21:35,205 --> 00:21:36,626
They sent six emails.

589
00:21:37,206 --> 00:21:38,967
I'm also graphing the unsubscribe rate.

590
00:21:39,187 --> 00:21:41,569
And if you can't see that, I'm going to zoom in right here.

591
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:47,243
That one pixel is the unsubscribed graph.

592
00:21:47,283 --> 00:21:48,864
2% of people unsubscribed from their emails,

593
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:53,047
despite emailing them almost once a week.

594
00:21:53,248 --> 00:21:55,269
People love this stuff, if you write it correctly.

595
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:57,791
So I'm going to kind of wrap up here.

596
00:21:57,811 --> 00:21:59,352
This is story time.

597
00:21:59,372 --> 00:22:03,015
This is me, again, nine years old,

598
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:04,917
loving Nintendo, dressed as Link.

599
00:22:06,178 --> 00:22:07,819
Two years ago, I had my own son.

600
00:22:07,939 --> 00:22:09,941
My wife and I had our first child.

601
00:22:10,601 --> 00:22:11,642
You know, you spend a lot of time just like.

602
00:22:12,012 --> 00:22:13,513
looking at this sleeping kid, and I'm wondering,

603
00:22:13,934 --> 00:22:14,654
am I going to write this?

604
00:22:14,794 --> 00:22:18,117
Am I going to someday make a shield for my son

605
00:22:18,177 --> 00:22:19,498
or make him a little Link outfit?

606
00:22:20,118 --> 00:22:20,939
I don't know.

607
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:23,241
But I had to work really hard to get Zombie King out.

608
00:22:23,701 --> 00:22:25,583
And this is the first game I used this marketing scheme

609
00:22:25,703 --> 00:22:27,244
on, this email marketing plan.

610
00:22:27,564 --> 00:22:30,346
And I got it out one month before he was born,

611
00:22:30,366 --> 00:22:31,908
because I knew, OK, once he's born,

612
00:22:32,328 --> 00:22:33,649
Dev time's over for a little while.

613
00:22:34,029 --> 00:22:37,352
And so while I was doing it, it turns out, actually,

614
00:22:37,372 --> 00:22:38,753
you can do some.

615
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,261
like answering support emails while the kid sleeps,

616
00:22:42,281 --> 00:22:44,022
because he sleeps all the time, and he's

617
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:46,503
trying to get to sleep and eat all the time.

618
00:22:47,024 --> 00:22:48,184
And this is an email from somebody

619
00:22:48,204 --> 00:22:50,005
who was on my mailing list.

620
00:22:50,045 --> 00:22:50,966
And I always subscribe.

621
00:22:51,186 --> 00:22:52,526
I always reply to them anytime.

622
00:22:52,906 --> 00:22:54,127
He said, great work on the game.

623
00:22:54,327 --> 00:22:55,908
My son and I are loving Zombie King.

624
00:22:56,688 --> 00:22:58,429
I was initially very apprehensive,

625
00:22:58,589 --> 00:23:01,691
but subsequent emails from you have been good and useful

626
00:23:01,811 --> 00:23:03,391
and true to your word that you haven't

627
00:23:03,431 --> 00:23:04,612
turned into a spam engine.

628
00:23:05,192 --> 00:23:05,793
I told you guys.

629
00:23:06,033 --> 00:23:06,693
Come on, I told you.

630
00:23:07,393 --> 00:23:07,613
Anyway.

631
00:23:08,255 --> 00:23:09,616
Then I replied back to him immediately,

632
00:23:09,636 --> 00:23:11,777
because any good dev would, and I said,

633
00:23:12,117 --> 00:23:13,098
thanks for your kind words.

634
00:23:13,518 --> 00:23:15,399
I think it is so cool that you play with your son.

635
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:18,101
My first child was actually born on Wednesday.

636
00:23:18,581 --> 00:23:19,902
Can't wait for him to be old enough

637
00:23:19,942 --> 00:23:21,162
so I can play games with him.

638
00:23:22,143 --> 00:23:23,604
And then this guy emailed me back,

639
00:23:24,704 --> 00:23:26,785
and he said, Blank is a big fan of your game

640
00:23:27,026 --> 00:23:28,226
and gets the concepts well enough.

641
00:23:28,987 --> 00:23:31,108
As with most games these days,

642
00:23:31,588 --> 00:23:33,609
he owns me and shows me how it's done.

643
00:23:33,629 --> 00:23:35,530
And the reason I blanked out his name,

644
00:23:36,451 --> 00:23:37,111
that guy's name is.

645
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:39,671
My reply was, what a coincidence.

646
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:41,711
My son's name is the exact same.

647
00:23:42,611 --> 00:23:44,232
He's actually in my arms as I type this.

648
00:23:44,772 --> 00:23:47,032
It's like, what kind of freaking weird marketing scheme

649
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,753
is this, where I'm like, I'm having

650
00:23:48,853 --> 00:23:50,893
dad time with one of my fans.

651
00:23:51,053 --> 00:23:54,114
Like, I'm having a bonding moment with somebody.

652
00:23:54,154 --> 00:23:56,835
Like, how many times have you learned that your son has

653
00:23:56,855 --> 00:23:58,355
the same name as one of your fans?

654
00:23:58,395 --> 00:23:59,995
Like, I've done this a long time.

655
00:24:00,035 --> 00:24:00,696
I've tried Twitter.

656
00:24:00,736 --> 00:24:02,916
I've tried talking to the press and stuff.

657
00:24:03,036 --> 00:24:05,357
But my god, nothing has ever worked where

658
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:06,817
I'm like bonding with my fans.

659
00:24:07,217 --> 00:24:07,837
And the reason is.

660
00:24:08,453 --> 00:24:11,214
is because it's a one-to-one communication with email.

661
00:24:11,354 --> 00:24:12,395
It goes to their inbox.

662
00:24:12,515 --> 00:24:13,936
It's one person to one person.

663
00:24:14,216 --> 00:24:16,177
And if you do this right, if you're genuine,

664
00:24:16,477 --> 00:24:18,198
you communicate with people in a kind way,

665
00:24:19,158 --> 00:24:19,959
you're going to connect with them.

666
00:24:20,299 --> 00:24:21,199
And that's all this is all about.

667
00:24:21,219 --> 00:24:24,961
This isn't cross-marketing, like upping your CPMs or ARPUs

668
00:24:25,001 --> 00:24:25,381
or whatever.

669
00:24:25,561 --> 00:24:26,722
It's just connecting with people.

670
00:24:26,742 --> 00:24:28,343
And that's what I'm trying to teach you all

671
00:24:28,363 --> 00:24:29,263
with this email stuff.

672
00:24:29,283 --> 00:24:30,864
This is the best mechanism for doing it.

673
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:34,606
You can follow me on Twitter down there.

674
00:24:34,646 --> 00:24:35,887
I mean, I, well, whatever.

675
00:24:36,703 --> 00:24:39,425
And then, how to market my game, again,

676
00:24:39,445 --> 00:24:41,046
I put the director's cut up there.

677
00:24:41,066 --> 00:24:42,588
Whoops, and there's my desktop.

678
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:45,069
But anyway, let me play this again.

679
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:49,093
But you can just get more information about that there.

680
00:24:49,413 --> 00:24:50,574
I don't know how much time do we have.

681
00:24:50,694 --> 00:24:51,014
Are we done?

682
00:24:51,034 --> 00:24:52,055
Is this the end of the day?

683
00:24:54,056 --> 00:24:55,077
Five minutes of questions.

684
00:24:55,217 --> 00:24:55,838
Let's go for it.

685
00:25:02,162 --> 00:25:05,105
In the meanwhile, let's give him a warm thank you

686
00:25:05,125 --> 00:25:05,745
for the talk so far.

687
00:25:14,144 --> 00:25:15,765
Hi, thanks so much for the talk.

688
00:25:15,985 --> 00:25:19,287
I was wanting to do a question about your unsubscribing.

689
00:25:19,447 --> 00:25:22,629
So I had on my email list, I was trying

690
00:25:22,649 --> 00:25:24,331
to send pretty frequent emails.

691
00:25:24,751 --> 00:25:26,912
And I got very, very mixed signals

692
00:25:27,072 --> 00:25:29,914
about how often emails were to be sent.

693
00:25:29,994 --> 00:25:32,456
So some people actually were unsubscribing a lot.

694
00:25:33,216 --> 00:25:35,197
And then I just asked some friends who were on the email

695
00:25:35,217 --> 00:25:36,378
list, like, how often?

696
00:25:36,398 --> 00:25:37,979
Am I emailing too often?

697
00:25:38,299 --> 00:25:39,840
Some of them said, absolutely.

698
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,201
Like, I'm getting way too much.

699
00:25:41,301 --> 00:25:42,022
I don't want this much.

700
00:25:42,102 --> 00:25:42,802
And then other people were like.

701
00:25:44,113 --> 00:25:46,055
Like you, some consultants were saying,

702
00:25:46,155 --> 00:25:48,297
no, you just email as much as you're going to email,

703
00:25:48,357 --> 00:25:50,079
and if they unsubscribe, they unsubscribe.

704
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:53,121
So can you just maybe comment about that a little bit more?

705
00:25:53,141 --> 00:25:54,643
Yeah, up your content game.

706
00:25:55,163 --> 00:25:55,824
No, I'm just kidding.

707
00:25:57,485 --> 00:25:59,027
Basically, here's what I do.

708
00:25:59,227 --> 00:26:01,749
For myself, I try and email every three weeks.

709
00:26:01,789 --> 00:26:03,250
And the reason I do that, and I don't want to get into this,

710
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:03,931
is a whole other talk.

711
00:26:05,754 --> 00:26:12,602
Google actually rates your emails based on how frequently you send and they actually they reset your good sender score after three weeks

712
00:26:12,622 --> 00:26:16,747
So if you don't email for three weeks, it kind of resets your like credit score and that's in a bad way

713
00:26:16,848 --> 00:26:19,871
so if they if you're sending quality content that people are opening and

714
00:26:20,252 --> 00:26:23,356
You keep doing that it actually builds your reputation if you do it every three weeks

715
00:26:24,671 --> 00:26:27,472
And I know that sounds frequent, but you've just got to send awesome stuff.

716
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:29,953
Like maybe the, and I don't know what your emails are.

717
00:26:29,973 --> 00:26:31,414
And I could actually talk to you afterwards.

718
00:26:31,474 --> 00:26:35,376
Again, you guys can contact me anytime this week and I will answer stuff.

719
00:26:35,436 --> 00:26:36,156
I love this stuff.

720
00:26:36,436 --> 00:26:36,717
I love that.

721
00:26:36,737 --> 00:26:39,798
I will talk to you at any time, so you can interrupt me, but at

722
00:26:39,878 --> 00:26:43,300
any time while I'm walking around, I'd have to look at them, but sometimes

723
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,661
it's just like, just give them cool stuff that might be better.

724
00:26:46,181 --> 00:26:48,122
The important thing is you don't want to just sell, sell, sell.

725
00:26:48,542 --> 00:26:52,804
And so that's often a problem that, that will cause unsubscribes.

726
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:56,206
So, but yeah, I'd be happy to check and see what you did.

727
00:26:58,327 --> 00:26:58,527
Next.

728
00:26:58,807 --> 00:27:03,368
Hey, so what is your best way to get people to your email list?

729
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:05,509
I don't know if you have statistics for that, but like,

730
00:27:06,429 --> 00:27:09,049
would you put that box at the top of your website,

731
00:27:09,209 --> 00:27:11,550
your social media, marketing?

732
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:13,190
Yeah, a lot of ways.

733
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:14,611
Here's one of the best ways I would say.

734
00:27:14,631 --> 00:27:15,391
It's like on a trailer.

735
00:27:15,471 --> 00:27:18,152
At the end of the trailer, say something like, and again,

736
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:19,893
Advertise your lead magnet.

737
00:27:20,193 --> 00:27:22,074
You'd be amazed, just adding a lead magnet

738
00:27:22,134 --> 00:27:25,056
will just boost, by an order of magnitude,

739
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:26,697
how much more subscriber you get.

740
00:27:26,977 --> 00:27:28,038
So at the end of your trailer, say,

741
00:27:28,218 --> 00:27:29,999
hey, if you like this art, get the free art book,

742
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:31,180
sign up for our mailing list,

743
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,620
and we'll email you this cool concept art.

744
00:27:33,241 --> 00:27:35,282
Just doing that, hit them where they are.

745
00:27:35,682 --> 00:27:37,723
You can also, like on social media, pin your tweet.

746
00:27:37,764 --> 00:27:39,284
I pinned a tweet that just says,

747
00:27:39,645 --> 00:27:40,725
hey, if you want more information,

748
00:27:40,745 --> 00:27:42,106
go get this game on there.

749
00:27:42,306 --> 00:27:44,027
But also forums, all kinds of stuff.

750
00:27:44,047 --> 00:27:46,189
And within your game is also a good way of doing it,

751
00:27:46,229 --> 00:27:47,649
just because your fans are in there.

752
00:27:48,635 --> 00:27:49,655
Those are some of my ideas.

753
00:27:51,776 --> 00:27:54,877
So you compared emails to Facebook, Twitter,

754
00:27:54,897 --> 00:27:55,758
other social media.

755
00:27:55,818 --> 00:27:57,998
But I was wondering if you had any thoughts on Discord,

756
00:27:58,019 --> 00:28:00,479
because that seems to be the big up and coming community

757
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,320
engagement tool.

758
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,821
I have not tested Discord.

759
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:08,380
But there's something fundamental about email

760
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,080
because people always check their email

761
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,200
and it doesn't scroll.

762
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,201
Like people are pretty good about keeping their inbox clean

763
00:28:14,601 --> 00:28:17,762
and just that natural ability will cause them

764
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:20,603
to open and click on more emails.

765
00:28:20,643 --> 00:28:22,963
The other thing is for some reason,

766
00:28:22,983 --> 00:28:24,444
just psychologically and the way the software works,

767
00:28:24,844 --> 00:28:26,284
when people are in email mode,

768
00:28:26,784 --> 00:28:28,705
they're thinking buying stuff for some reason.

769
00:28:28,965 --> 00:28:30,605
When they're in Discord and social media,

770
00:28:30,765 --> 00:28:31,726
they're just hanging out with friends,

771
00:28:31,766 --> 00:28:32,786
it's like a cocktail party.

772
00:28:33,126 --> 00:28:34,586
And that's why it doesn't always work

773
00:28:35,566 --> 00:28:41,508
advertise within social media because it's like you're coming into somebody's cocktail party and saying hey buy this drink

774
00:28:41,608 --> 00:28:44,910
It's you like Tito's alcohol. You're gonna like this one

775
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:51,312
That's you're kind of crashing somebody's party in social media, but emails all business and they're willing to like pay for stuff

776
00:28:51,332 --> 00:28:57,394
That's just a hunch, but I feel like discord is also more in the party side of things, but that's just a hunch

777
00:28:57,414 --> 00:29:00,155
I haven't tested it if anybody has data, please email me

778
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:03,981
I had a question, two questions.

779
00:29:04,461 --> 00:29:05,381
We'll see if I can sneak in both.

780
00:29:05,622 --> 00:29:08,023
But the first one is about the content of the email

781
00:29:08,203 --> 00:29:11,685
and getting rated by Gmail as a promotional email.

782
00:29:12,066 --> 00:29:13,887
And I wonder whether you feel like, oh yeah,

783
00:29:13,907 --> 00:29:15,848
you should be sending emails that are mostly not rated

784
00:29:15,908 --> 00:29:17,209
as a promotion, or whether, no, no,

785
00:29:17,249 --> 00:29:18,790
you should be in the promotion tab

786
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:20,050
just so everybody understands.

787
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:21,952
Yeah, I'm trying to sell you something,

788
00:29:21,992 --> 00:29:23,552
but I'm trying to talk about myself at the same time.

789
00:29:23,592 --> 00:29:24,913
You want to get out of that promotion tab

790
00:29:24,953 --> 00:29:26,294
as fast as you possibly can.

791
00:29:26,894 --> 00:29:28,175
There's a whole GDC talk.

792
00:29:28,817 --> 00:29:30,318
just about how to get out of promotional tab,

793
00:29:30,358 --> 00:29:31,259
which they probably wouldn't approve

794
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:32,460
because they think this stuff's boring,

795
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,081
but basically about the promotional tab,

796
00:29:35,282 --> 00:29:37,363
the best way is to send short emails

797
00:29:37,723 --> 00:29:40,165
that don't have many links and don't have many images.

798
00:29:40,465 --> 00:29:41,586
One of the worst things you can do is,

799
00:29:41,606 --> 00:29:45,008
I see a lot of people who won't write their newsletter

800
00:29:45,048 --> 00:29:47,730
for like six months, and then they talk everything

801
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:49,371
that that studio has been doing for six months,

802
00:29:49,651 --> 00:29:51,533
and it's all these pictures, all these links.

803
00:29:52,013 --> 00:29:56,596
That hurts your Gmail score because spammers and...

804
00:29:57,009 --> 00:29:59,450
And marketers typically load stuff up with images and links.

805
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:01,511
Keep your emails very short and simple,

806
00:30:01,971 --> 00:30:03,532
and just talk to them like they're human.

807
00:30:03,572 --> 00:30:04,392
Don't try and sell stuff.

808
00:30:04,412 --> 00:30:06,013
Sell stuff, hey, I just got something new.

809
00:30:06,173 --> 00:30:07,874
Talking first person, like you're,

810
00:30:07,994 --> 00:30:09,334
one way that I typically write my emails

811
00:30:09,395 --> 00:30:11,656
is I imagine I'm writing to my best friend about my game,

812
00:30:12,336 --> 00:30:13,916
and then I just send that to everybody,

813
00:30:14,077 --> 00:30:15,157
all of my subscribers.

814
00:30:15,377 --> 00:30:16,438
And that does amazingly well.

815
00:30:16,498 --> 00:30:17,838
You don't want to be a formal,

816
00:30:18,278 --> 00:30:19,839
like press release style writing.

817
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:21,000
It's very conversational.

818
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,600
Again, it's like a one-to-one communication.

819
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,281
And a lot of times other tricks you can do is you can ask a question,

820
00:30:25,301 --> 00:30:26,342
just like, hey, what's your favorite game?

821
00:30:26,782 --> 00:30:29,584
If they reply, Google tricks Google and they say,

822
00:30:30,224 --> 00:30:33,286
who would ever reply to a spam message?

823
00:30:33,366 --> 00:30:34,307
This can't be spam.

824
00:30:34,327 --> 00:30:37,709
This is out, take it out of the promotional tab and put it in their main tab.

825
00:30:38,109 --> 00:30:41,191
That's why when that person answered and said,

826
00:30:41,211 --> 00:30:43,492
hey, could you please send me that missing Isaac email?

827
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:46,334
Google is like, this is a quality email.

828
00:30:46,767 --> 00:30:49,269
who would respond to a marketer's email.

829
00:30:49,529 --> 00:30:50,630
And so your whole game as,

830
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:51,851
when you get into email marketing,

831
00:30:51,871 --> 00:30:53,292
is trying to get out of the promotion tab

832
00:30:53,312 --> 00:30:54,333
and into the real inbox.

833
00:30:55,093 --> 00:30:57,415
When you're doing that, MailChimp will let you,

834
00:30:57,515 --> 00:30:59,836
you know, use your branded colors

835
00:30:59,877 --> 00:31:02,118
and your company logo and your header of your email.

836
00:31:02,138 --> 00:31:02,959
It sounds like you were like,

837
00:31:02,999 --> 00:31:03,779
no, no, don't do that.

838
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,501
It's a feature, but turn it off, turn it off.

839
00:31:05,541 --> 00:31:07,302
Just send plain white background,

840
00:31:07,322 --> 00:31:09,583
aerial text, no branding.

841
00:31:10,053 --> 00:31:11,974
A little bit of branding, but the thing is I found,

842
00:31:12,794 --> 00:31:14,275
I subscribe to all of your email addresses,

843
00:31:14,415 --> 00:31:15,555
all your email lists by the way.

844
00:31:17,036 --> 00:31:18,556
I just go through and just try and collect

845
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:19,436
as much data as I can.

846
00:31:20,077 --> 00:31:22,297
If I don't hear from you a while, I forget who you are.

847
00:31:22,337 --> 00:31:25,438
You're like, Sparking Monkey Studios.

848
00:31:25,598 --> 00:31:26,659
I don't remember your games,

849
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:28,699
I don't remember your branding as much,

850
00:31:29,219 --> 00:31:30,580
but the thing I do remember are your games.

851
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:33,261
So what I do for my games is I always do a headline image,

852
00:31:33,601 --> 00:31:35,341
just like a header image of the game,

853
00:31:35,361 --> 00:31:36,582
whatever game I'm promoting or whatever.

854
00:31:37,081 --> 00:31:40,064
And that's more triggering than your studio logo.

855
00:31:40,124 --> 00:31:41,765
I know you worked really hard on your studio logos,

856
00:31:41,805 --> 00:31:43,687
but they kind of all kind of blend together.

857
00:31:43,947 --> 00:31:46,609
The more important thing is I just do one big reminder image

858
00:31:46,729 --> 00:31:47,630
of the game I'm promoting,

859
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,772
and then I'll link with a call to action.

860
00:31:52,314 --> 00:31:53,095
Okay, last question.

861
00:31:53,115 --> 00:31:53,635
All right.

862
00:31:54,696 --> 00:32:00,061
So I'm subscribed to a lot of newsletter that I like.

863
00:32:01,118 --> 00:32:03,560
and I subscribed because I wanted to.

864
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,222
But usually when I get to my email,

865
00:32:07,043 --> 00:32:08,984
I'm looking for something specific,

866
00:32:09,605 --> 00:32:12,407
you know, and a specific email that someone sent me.

867
00:32:12,507 --> 00:32:16,150
So there's a lot of newsletter emails

868
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:18,612
that I think would be nice,

869
00:32:18,692 --> 00:32:21,174
but I kind of just don't read sometimes.

870
00:32:21,994 --> 00:32:26,478
So is there anything that we could do

871
00:32:26,598 --> 00:32:27,699
to not make?

872
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:31,001
people ignore your newsletter.

873
00:32:31,041 --> 00:32:34,483
Like, oh, that's nice, I'm gonna read that later.

874
00:32:34,763 --> 00:32:36,684
And that later never comes.

875
00:32:37,104 --> 00:32:39,465
Well, like I was saying, give, give, give,

876
00:32:39,765 --> 00:32:42,327
and the fact that you're like a little present wizard,

877
00:32:42,667 --> 00:32:45,488
like, you want to give gifts that people,

878
00:32:45,528 --> 00:32:46,929
when they see the subject line, are like,

879
00:32:47,089 --> 00:32:48,010
yes, I want that.

880
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:49,150
So one of the first things, like,

881
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:51,732
when you sign up for my newsletter within my game,

882
00:32:51,972 --> 00:32:53,433
one of the first things I email you is like,

883
00:32:53,713 --> 00:32:55,133
here's a tip on how to get more gold.

884
00:32:55,554 --> 00:32:56,955
And they're like, yeah, I do wanna know

885
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,675
how to get more gold, I am definitely opening this.

886
00:32:58,895 --> 00:33:00,576
That's what I mean by a gift.

887
00:33:01,036 --> 00:33:03,597
Or, if you've got a really complicated game,

888
00:33:03,857 --> 00:33:06,657
hey, download this tech tree.

889
00:33:06,697 --> 00:33:07,718
That could be the subject line.

890
00:33:07,798 --> 00:33:10,058
Like, hey, you like the tech tree for my game?

891
00:33:10,459 --> 00:33:12,459
And then they open it and they see a whole tech tree

892
00:33:12,779 --> 00:33:14,280
that you've helped them.

893
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,980
That's what all Nintendo Power was.

894
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:18,801
Just buy a copy of Nintendo Power and just flip through it.

895
00:33:18,901 --> 00:33:20,662
All these pages of maps and cheat codes,

896
00:33:21,062 --> 00:33:22,382
that's the stuff that people want.

897
00:33:22,582 --> 00:33:24,143
So if you just put that in the subject line and say,

898
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:25,881
open this email to get that thing,

899
00:33:25,901 --> 00:33:26,762
they're gonna be like, yes,

900
00:33:26,842 --> 00:33:28,344
that's exactly what I need right now.

901
00:33:28,444 --> 00:33:30,505
So, you're just giving good things

902
00:33:30,526 --> 00:33:32,287
that will help them with your game.

903
00:33:32,407 --> 00:33:35,370
So, it's easier if you have a very complex game.

904
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:36,991
But, I hope that answers.

905
00:33:37,852 --> 00:33:40,014
I, again, I will talk about this forever,

906
00:33:40,074 --> 00:33:41,095
so even though there's no more questions,

907
00:33:41,255 --> 00:33:42,116
if you wanna meet me out there,

908
00:33:42,216 --> 00:33:43,417
I will talk to you all week.

909
00:33:43,537 --> 00:33:44,578
You get a free pass on this stuff.

910
00:33:44,918 --> 00:33:46,039
So, thank you very much.

911
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,200
Thanks for coming.
