1
00:00:06,274 --> 00:00:06,663
Yay.

2
00:00:07,843 --> 00:00:11,904
So hey, everyone. Thanks for coming. They want us to tell

3
00:00:11,944 --> 00:00:13,885
you to please remember to silence your cell phones and

4
00:00:13,925 --> 00:00:17,366
also please fill out the feedback form at the end of the

5
00:00:17,426 --> 00:00:20,686
session. And if you didn't, get your badge checked so that you

6
00:00:20,706 --> 00:00:26,048
can do so. So this talk was kind of given a punchy name to kind

7
00:00:26,088 --> 00:00:29,348
of mask the diversity part, to trick people who wanted to see,

8
00:00:29,408 --> 00:00:33,449
you know, a night fight with laser fists in a cave. But, you

9
00:00:33,489 --> 00:00:36,910
know, that won't be happening. But congrats, you are at an

10
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:37,630
important talk.

11
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:47,659
This is perhaps a better name for the talk. So who we are, I'm Shawn Alexander Allen, I'm an artist, game designer, writer, new challenger.

12
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:55,505
Yeah, and I'm Kat Small, I am a game developer with Brooklyn Gamery, I'm also a product designer at SoundCloud and the co-founder of the Code Liberation Foundation.

13
00:00:59,832 --> 00:01:04,276
So this talk is about diversity. But by diversity, we

14
00:01:04,336 --> 00:01:08,098
don't just mean slapping some brown people or women in a game

15
00:01:08,118 --> 00:01:12,722
and calling it a day. Diversity is not just some veneer for your

16
00:01:12,782 --> 00:01:16,204
games to reside underneath. Because when you think of it

17
00:01:16,244 --> 00:01:19,767
that way, it can be easily chipped away at, and it has to

18
00:01:19,827 --> 00:01:22,229
be something that you're not ending at the end, that you're

19
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:23,990
adding towards the beginning so that you don't end up

20
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,932
sacrificing in the end. I mean, we're not really going for this.

21
00:01:30,646 --> 00:01:37,773
Exactly, exactly. So this talk is really aimed at thinking way deeper about the games that you're making, right?

22
00:01:38,153 --> 00:01:42,117
What the content is, how that content informs the rest of the game.

23
00:01:42,838 --> 00:01:45,881
You know, like we build systems and we're thinking about systems from the get-go,

24
00:01:45,941 --> 00:01:48,604
but are we really thinking about the other parts of our games?

25
00:01:49,645 --> 00:01:52,287
Like who's starring in them? How would they act and things like that?

26
00:01:52,347 --> 00:01:55,090
So we we don't really think through a lot of things like we're thinking about like

27
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:59,133
you know, our characters shooting, but like, why are they shooting? And, and, you know, like, what,

28
00:01:59,533 --> 00:02:03,896
who's in this game? And, and like, how does this uphold, you know, for example, like real world

29
00:02:04,136 --> 00:02:04,916
stuff that's going on?

30
00:02:06,907 --> 00:02:08,268
So what's in it for you?

31
00:02:10,249 --> 00:02:12,631
So we're going to be talking through lots

32
00:02:12,671 --> 00:02:15,613
of different games at various different success levels,

33
00:02:16,073 --> 00:02:17,294
various different build levels.

34
00:02:17,714 --> 00:02:20,415
We're going to be dissecting these games,

35
00:02:20,896 --> 00:02:23,357
talking about different genres as well,

36
00:02:23,818 --> 00:02:26,559
just all across the spectrum of what we call indie.

37
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,521
And we're going to be examining what creators have done

38
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:33,423
to diversify the landscape, like how well they did.

39
00:02:34,264 --> 00:02:36,845
just kind of critiquing them, the goods and the bads,

40
00:02:36,925 --> 00:02:38,246
and even the parts in the middle.

41
00:02:40,446 --> 00:02:44,388
And our goal in this talk is to show concrete examples

42
00:02:44,428 --> 00:02:47,309
of thinking, and talking a little bit deeper,

43
00:02:47,369 --> 00:02:49,650
thinking a little bit deeper than just the surface level

44
00:02:49,731 --> 00:02:50,751
of what diversity is.

45
00:02:51,511 --> 00:02:54,933
And hopefully it leads to you getting to broaden your reach,

46
00:02:55,493 --> 00:02:56,093
audience-wise.

47
00:02:57,735 --> 00:03:02,496
community, and you know, even possibly changing the market and

48
00:03:02,556 --> 00:03:05,036
like the people that you're accessing. But we also

49
00:03:05,096 --> 00:03:07,937
acknowledge that this is only a singular part of the equation,

50
00:03:08,657 --> 00:03:12,918
and like, there are other parts to like making games,

51
00:03:13,018 --> 00:03:17,219
obviously. And, you know, this is just one part of it. And it's

52
00:03:17,259 --> 00:03:20,720
kind of not, yeah, so this is why we're calling it subversive.

53
00:03:23,007 --> 00:03:26,368
So we're going to be discussing a couple of things, a couple of

54
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:27,649
specific games here.

55
00:03:27,889 --> 00:03:31,370
And just to note, this isn't a value judgment on the creators.

56
00:03:31,851 --> 00:03:34,191
It's really just an examination of their games.

57
00:03:34,231 --> 00:03:37,473
We're kind of trying to examine the impact, not the intent,

58
00:03:37,573 --> 00:03:38,033
per se.

59
00:03:40,134 --> 00:03:40,874
So let's go.

60
00:03:43,834 --> 00:03:48,377
So hey, this is catacomb kids. It's a rogue like platformer

61
00:03:48,397 --> 00:03:51,380
with random character generation. It was a kick

62
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,623
starter success. It earned over $30,000 on kick starter. It's

63
00:03:55,683 --> 00:04:00,186
currently in early access. Tyreek plumber is giving talk

64
00:04:00,226 --> 00:04:04,449
here later today. Saw a lot of success from an awesome video

65
00:04:04,609 --> 00:04:07,491
about all the different things you could do with a rock, which

66
00:04:07,531 --> 00:04:09,633
was pretty cool. And the video kind of went viral.

67
00:04:10,754 --> 00:04:16,141
and we've seen a lot of roguelikes that have defined character types, skin colors, etc.

68
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:22,709
but in Catacomb Kids all of the characters have wildly different skin colors, names, stats, faces, hairstyles

69
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:26,174
and the kids are barely recognizable as gendered too.

70
00:04:28,648 --> 00:04:31,330
these are some of the kind of randomly generated characters

71
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:34,233
from just a couple of play throughs of the game. And the

72
00:04:34,273 --> 00:04:38,236
randomness of the kids supports the idea that lack of set

73
00:04:38,296 --> 00:04:41,519
situations with the player characters and it upholds the

74
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:44,222
idea of random generation in the game's design.

75
00:04:45,242 --> 00:04:48,443
players will have to try multiple character looks. They

76
00:04:48,483 --> 00:04:53,084
won't necessarily get stuck on one main and also they won't get

77
00:04:53,124 --> 00:04:57,205
stuck on a gender choice. You could theoretically really

78
00:04:57,325 --> 00:04:59,886
always try to go for the dude with stats but you might be

79
00:04:59,946 --> 00:05:02,486
sitting there for like 20 minutes cycling through them. So

80
00:05:02,546 --> 00:05:06,147
it's kind of interesting how the random choice means that you

81
00:05:06,187 --> 00:05:09,448
actually have to experience somebody different every time.

82
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:16,869
And also it's because the kids are, part of the game is like the fragility of life, so the kids die quickly,

83
00:05:16,969 --> 00:05:20,656
so then you just have to go get someone else, and then you don't get stuck on them.

84
00:05:22,468 --> 00:05:24,969
So you can kind of compare this to Spelunky which has an

85
00:05:25,589 --> 00:05:29,670
interesting multi-ethnic cast but you have to unlock many of

86
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:33,772
those characters. But what's really interesting in comparison

87
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:35,792
with Spelunky is a lot of people get attached to their main. I

88
00:05:36,012 --> 00:05:40,453
see a lot of turban wearing people picking the turban

89
00:05:40,493 --> 00:05:43,474
wearing character which is really awesome because the

90
00:05:43,534 --> 00:05:46,955
character, those characters don't exist in games generally.

91
00:05:47,395 --> 00:05:49,896
But it's still filled with, you know, like,

92
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,353
random like ethnic stereotypes and you still have to kind of

93
00:05:53,413 --> 00:05:56,134
play the game for a while to find like more brown people to

94
00:05:56,234 --> 00:05:59,855
use. There was something and also then that kind of brings up

95
00:05:59,895 --> 00:06:02,295
how because of the set characters you can kind of pick

96
00:06:02,355 --> 00:06:05,616
like, you know, a black woman who's like a pirate with like an

97
00:06:05,696 --> 00:06:09,657
eye patch but you can only ever rescue these three people and

98
00:06:09,758 --> 00:06:12,378
kind of it's weird that the diversity here is like the pug

99
00:06:12,938 --> 00:06:17,500
is like you have two white people and then a dog. And, you

100
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,600
know, the damsel jokes kind of tired in and of itself.

101
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:25,061
But what could actually kind of use a little bit of improvement

102
00:06:25,361 --> 00:06:28,763
that I just think about is that, you know, what is the difference

103
00:06:28,803 --> 00:06:32,726
between Christina and Thomas right here? Like nothing, right?

104
00:06:32,786 --> 00:06:36,928
Stats or whatever. But I mean, the fact that the game kind of

105
00:06:37,128 --> 00:06:40,991
assigns gendered names to specific gender roles is kind of

106
00:06:41,051 --> 00:06:44,293
actually not super helpful. Like the game doesn't really actually

107
00:06:44,353 --> 00:06:45,233
gain anything from it.

108
00:06:47,052 --> 00:06:50,175
So another game, we all pretty much know shovel knight. It's

109
00:06:50,235 --> 00:06:52,557
probably one of the most mainstream independent games out

110
00:06:52,577 --> 00:06:56,040
there. I love the game personally. It did over $300,000

111
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,564
on kick starter. And it's been a huge success and I feel like

112
00:07:01,624 --> 00:07:04,787
part of that success is because the whole game has been thought

113
00:07:04,827 --> 00:07:06,008
through on an extra level.

114
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:10,750
I think more farther than a lot of different games. And it's

115
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:14,871
very tight design without necessarily becoming suffocating

116
00:07:14,911 --> 00:07:17,893
and trying to force players to play through it in its own

117
00:07:18,533 --> 00:07:22,074
designed way. But the designers thought through a lot of aspects

118
00:07:22,114 --> 00:07:22,515
of the game.

119
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:28,269
So one thing that was interesting is that they needed

120
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:31,814
to, there was an article on Gamma Sutra where they came out

121
00:07:31,834 --> 00:07:34,818
and they talked about how they needed to expand the NES

122
00:07:34,858 --> 00:07:37,021
palette, because this is the NES palette and the NES palette

123
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,003
actually doesn't have

124
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:43,151
many browns in it. So for backer rewards and just for other

125
00:07:43,211 --> 00:07:46,193
things they needed to expand the palette. So this is one of the

126
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:49,155
colors that they added to the game. And because they were

127
00:07:49,195 --> 00:07:51,596
saying, hey, look, we're going to look at the very basic thing.

128
00:07:51,636 --> 00:07:55,078
So a lot of people look at retro whatever and they say we need to

129
00:07:55,118 --> 00:07:59,041
stick to the NES palette. But the NES palette has problems in

130
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,942
and of itself and they had figured out that they could add

131
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,844
like five colors to actually add diversity to the game.

132
00:08:05,845 --> 00:08:11,708
and they also kind of were using this term gender swap for a while for a new feature

133
00:08:12,228 --> 00:08:19,432
and they actually changed their marketing speak to body swap to make it less harmful

134
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:20,952
and more inclusive to people.

135
00:08:21,933 --> 00:08:27,678
but then there's the kind of one stumbling brick where it's like, but why are their gender roles

136
00:08:28,179 --> 00:08:33,503
very specified as the main characters? Like why is Sheil Knight the damsel who needs rescuing?

137
00:08:33,623 --> 00:08:38,047
And why is she the defensive person where Shovel Knight's the guy who's the attacker?

138
00:08:38,588 --> 00:08:42,431
And really, like again, what does Shovel Knight gain from being a guy?

139
00:08:49,114 --> 00:08:54,260
Great, so Broken Age. Also probably heard about this game. This game is pretty popular.

140
00:08:55,602 --> 00:09:01,930
So it's got some really interesting things in it, right? Like firstly, it stars a black woman and a white guy.

141
00:09:02,591 --> 00:09:05,254
They don't have a romantic encounter, which is like also...

142
00:09:06,015 --> 00:09:10,496
kind of cool because a lot of times when there's people of different genders in a game, they're

143
00:09:10,536 --> 00:09:15,236
like romantically paired together, so that's exciting. And the other interesting thing about

144
00:09:15,256 --> 00:09:19,297
that though is that it kind of, which is a good and a bad thing because they could have easily

145
00:09:19,377 --> 00:09:24,858
messed this up, it avoids the complexity of like those kinds of relationships and some people call

146
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:30,019
it like the swirl for example. There's a lot of complexities in there. And so by having, not

147
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:34,680
having that there, they easily avoided, you know, what could have been a mess.

148
00:09:35,521 --> 00:09:38,923
And it was actually funded without even having protagonists.

149
00:09:39,324 --> 00:09:42,226
So hats off to Tim for actually deciding

150
00:09:42,286 --> 00:09:44,368
to make one of the characters a black woman.

151
00:09:45,489 --> 00:09:46,850
It didn't have to happen, but it did,

152
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,471
and that was really awesome because it showed

153
00:09:48,551 --> 00:09:50,012
that there was some thinking there.

154
00:09:50,413 --> 00:09:51,834
It was a very conscious decision.

155
00:09:52,354 --> 00:09:57,616
And also, like, thanks to the community for not getting angry that there was a woman who

156
00:09:57,676 --> 00:10:00,378
was black, you know, as the star of the game.

157
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:05,019
Because there were other games where even just the hint of the main character being

158
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,682
not a man, for example, Mighty No. 9, people got super angry.

159
00:10:11,522 --> 00:10:15,124
And the other nice thing about this is that there's actually a black voice actor for the

160
00:10:15,144 --> 00:10:15,804
character as well.

161
00:10:18,258 --> 00:10:23,262
Something that they could have thought about a little bit more is who they were marketing to.

162
00:10:23,402 --> 00:10:30,527
So for example, they could have actually gone to different websites like Ebony,

163
00:10:30,567 --> 00:10:34,951
who also runs a wonderful magazine and there's other traditional forms of media as well

164
00:10:34,991 --> 00:10:39,874
that are kind of like focused at black buyers, and they could have actually had a...

165
00:10:41,536 --> 00:10:43,739
they could have actually done something there and said,

166
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:46,243
hey, our game is kind of unique,

167
00:10:46,444 --> 00:10:47,626
would you be interested in buying it?

168
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:48,687
Here's a little bit about the game.

169
00:10:48,988 --> 00:10:51,131
So they could have pitched that to traditional media

170
00:10:52,133 --> 00:10:54,717
and actually possibly open their audience even more.

171
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:05,412
So on the negative side, there are hair jokes. And we've had enough of those. So there aren't a

172
00:11:05,452 --> 00:11:10,535
lot of black characters in games in general. There aren't a lot of black characters in this

173
00:11:10,595 --> 00:11:16,439
game. And yet we're making fun of black hair. It's already seen as something that's like weird

174
00:11:16,539 --> 00:11:23,404
or like strange or unnatural. And so just adding on this joke, which is also impossible, by the

175
00:11:23,444 --> 00:11:23,644
way.

176
00:11:25,265 --> 00:11:27,385
If it's open, it doesn't shake closed.

177
00:11:27,485 --> 00:11:31,426
Like, once it's down, you have to comb it or something.

178
00:11:31,506 --> 00:11:33,946
So black hair doesn't work like that, firstly.

179
00:11:34,406 --> 00:11:37,087
And so it was really obvious that they had no one to say,

180
00:11:37,107 --> 00:11:38,887
what are you doing?

181
00:11:40,508 --> 00:11:44,068
So that was definitely a negative about this game.

182
00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:52,290
So yeah, I mean, again, another, uh, another, uh,

183
00:11:54,009 --> 00:11:58,190
popular game, it's a rhythm based roguelike. We're trying

184
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:00,571
not to go too deep into stuff that probably everybody knows.

185
00:12:01,311 --> 00:12:04,772
But despite being like it seems like the super niche game, it

186
00:12:04,912 --> 00:12:08,393
did super well. So that's really awesome. Another game that I

187
00:12:08,433 --> 00:12:13,175
really love. And I really honestly want to know where are

188
00:12:13,215 --> 00:12:17,376
my crypt likes. When are people going to start copying this idea

189
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:21,017
and start making more stuff with it. And it's also really amazing

190
00:12:21,037 --> 00:12:22,718
that it stars a girl as the main character.

191
00:12:24,427 --> 00:12:29,390
And also it's like the cast of the main like random characters

192
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:33,772
is really cool because it's variously diverse. They have a

193
00:12:33,852 --> 00:12:37,554
gender non-conforming character who's brown in the game also.

194
00:12:37,754 --> 00:12:41,757
And also their play styles reflect their difference. Like

195
00:12:41,797 --> 00:12:44,878
it's not just everybody is the exact same character pasted over.

196
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,361
But there is a problem when you get to the same character.

197
00:12:50,615 --> 00:12:56,117
this is the co-op character and there's a problem with the

198
00:12:56,357 --> 00:13:00,098
second player co-op character being just a pallet swap of the

199
00:13:00,118 --> 00:13:04,800
main character and it's like she's black, right? But she's

200
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,462
not really a character. Like she doesn't have any thought. She

201
00:13:08,482 --> 00:13:11,303
doesn't have a story behind her. She has another name but that

202
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:15,665
doesn't actually matter. I mean, the color swap as a two player

203
00:13:15,745 --> 00:13:17,385
character is kind of an old concept.

204
00:13:18,813 --> 00:13:22,476
I mean, no one really bought Luigi as a main character in Super Mario Bros.

205
00:13:22,516 --> 00:13:24,118
Like, you never wanted to play as him.

206
00:13:24,798 --> 00:13:26,940
And all he did was, he was green instead of red.

207
00:13:27,521 --> 00:13:30,664
And so it's like, when you make her black instead of white, it's like...

208
00:13:32,366 --> 00:13:35,228
Like, there's literally nothing about her that's interesting, and I felt like...

209
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:39,106
I was just kind of curious why. I mean, this is what has been

210
00:13:39,146 --> 00:13:42,688
done actually traditionally. On top the guy is obviously

211
00:13:42,728 --> 00:13:45,569
modeled after Mel Gibson. On the bottom the other guy is modeled

212
00:13:45,609 --> 00:13:49,430
after nobody at all. So like Danny Glover actually doesn't

213
00:13:49,471 --> 00:13:54,092
even make an appearance. And if you actually look really closely

214
00:13:54,232 --> 00:13:59,154
at the in-game screen shot, they have the same head. They put

215
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:01,936
more detail into his suit than they did in changing his head

216
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:02,876
and his hairstyle.

217
00:14:04,851 --> 00:14:08,401
And I'm harping on this a little bit because this is kind of

218
00:14:08,441 --> 00:14:11,450
very important. You can't see her on that background.

219
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:19,539
like her hair and it's a problem that's in film it's in photography uh stockings that come in nude

220
00:14:19,819 --> 00:14:25,584
that are peach and it's like the the generic like the default for film was white people like that's

221
00:14:25,644 --> 00:14:30,048
why like film looks bad with black people that's why people don't know how to make do makeup for

222
00:14:30,068 --> 00:14:34,391
them that's why it's like this whole revolution now but it's funny because when you think about

223
00:14:34,451 --> 00:14:37,374
something and you're just like hey we're just gonna do that it's like she doesn't pop from

224
00:14:37,414 --> 00:14:39,135
the background she's not a main character

225
00:14:39,656 --> 00:14:45,023
and there wasn't a whole lot of effort put into even thinking like maybe her skin and her hair won't be seeable.

226
00:14:45,904 --> 00:14:50,229
She actually kind of got like the real short in the stick like she just is not present.

227
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,448
The next game is Shantae.

228
00:14:57,328 --> 00:15:00,408
And Shantae is also super, it was really successful

229
00:15:00,428 --> 00:15:03,269
on Kickstarter, made over 700K.

230
00:15:03,409 --> 00:15:06,630
It's a platformer starring a female belly dancer.

231
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:07,810
And so that was really interesting.

232
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:12,051
On the sad side, it's been a little hard for WayForward

233
00:15:12,091 --> 00:15:14,371
to actually procure funds to make Shantae,

234
00:15:14,771 --> 00:15:16,992
new Shantae games, because it was a female character.

235
00:15:18,012 --> 00:15:19,352
And she also happens to be brown.

236
00:15:19,792 --> 00:15:23,093
So there have been some interesting ups and downs in here.

237
00:15:24,253 --> 00:15:27,596
Now, firstly, I'm really excited about Shantae because it's like really interesting.

238
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:30,098
It's like a very fun game.

239
00:15:30,178 --> 00:15:30,918
It's very exciting.

240
00:15:30,978 --> 00:15:32,159
It has a female character.

241
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:33,180
She's also brown.

242
00:15:34,241 --> 00:15:40,285
But things like this happened, where, for example, for a little bit of time, they lightened

243
00:15:40,405 --> 00:15:40,846
her art.

244
00:15:41,386 --> 00:15:44,389
and the fan base was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.

245
00:15:44,409 --> 00:15:45,611
That's not cool.

246
00:15:45,951 --> 00:15:47,032
She was a brown character.

247
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:49,595
Why is she now like super light skinned?

248
00:15:49,655 --> 00:15:52,097
And so people were obviously getting really attached

249
00:15:52,137 --> 00:15:53,899
to the fact that there was this brown person

250
00:15:53,939 --> 00:15:56,061
being represented in a game.

251
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:59,104
So later they actually fixed the color.

252
00:16:01,567 --> 00:16:05,472
didn't really like talk about it very much but they did address

253
00:16:05,532 --> 00:16:09,317
and correct it so that was good on them for actually coming back

254
00:16:09,357 --> 00:16:11,240
and saying okay we're going to change your color back.

255
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:17,858
But another issue is that if you've ever played Shantae, at least the versions that I have played,

256
00:16:18,999 --> 00:16:24,065
there are a lot of female characters which is awesome, but most if not all of them are like

257
00:16:24,646 --> 00:16:31,174
just scantily clad, they have like very large breasts, they have very large noticeable like

258
00:16:31,734 --> 00:16:34,675
butts and they have like their midriff is showing and they're

259
00:16:34,695 --> 00:16:38,917
just very sexualized. So it's kind of uncomfortable being a

260
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:41,898
woman playing this game and I personally was very frustrated

261
00:16:41,978 --> 00:16:44,779
when I played it for the first time because I was really

262
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:48,401
excited for Shante. Again, it's really cool to see this kind of

263
00:16:48,581 --> 00:16:49,361
person in a game.

264
00:16:50,162 --> 00:16:52,022
But then when I started playing it, I was like, oh my god,

265
00:16:52,102 --> 00:16:53,363
every character is like this.

266
00:16:53,383 --> 00:16:56,444
They're all the same model, the same build.

267
00:16:56,484 --> 00:17:00,206
And a lot of the guys had a lot of body diversity and things

268
00:17:00,226 --> 00:17:03,207
like that, but all the women were basically sexualized.

269
00:17:03,247 --> 00:17:04,928
And so that was really frustrating,

270
00:17:04,948 --> 00:17:07,669
because it's not like every woman has

271
00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:09,790
to be wearing completely covered up things,

272
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:12,771
or every woman has to be wearing nothing at all.

273
00:17:12,851 --> 00:17:14,912
It's really about having a mixture of all of it,

274
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:15,272
because

275
00:17:15,992 --> 00:17:19,934
some women want to wear revealing things and that's fine and some women don't want to wear

276
00:17:20,214 --> 00:17:24,515
revealing things but by having all of them sexualized it just makes it really uncomfortable

277
00:17:24,615 --> 00:17:31,157
for a lot of women and female identified people to play. More sexy snake women for everyone.

278
00:17:31,857 --> 00:17:37,039
So I guess I'll go to a little vein and talk about my game for a bit. This is a beat em up with

279
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:43,141
turn based RPG elements and I kind of started out making the game for my like of beat em ups and I

280
00:17:44,536 --> 00:17:48,118
As I worked on it, something kind of happened. I just kind of started thinking heavily about

281
00:17:48,739 --> 00:17:54,722
the need for representation in games and also I needed money so I ran a kick starter, which

282
00:17:54,982 --> 00:18:01,446
kind of ended up making about $50,000. And my kick starter updates highlighted the culture

283
00:18:01,466 --> 00:18:05,409
that I was pulling from like graffiti and trying not to be too ignorant.

284
00:18:06,069 --> 00:18:07,689
about my own appropriation of it.

285
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,870
And it actually kind of got me a couple of articles on Rock Paper Shotgun

286
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:16,071
when Adam Smith found it and he wrote about how it sounded like New York poetry.

287
00:18:17,432 --> 00:18:20,932
And talking about the importance of diversity in the game

288
00:18:20,992 --> 00:18:25,193
and how it was implementing it got me a lot of other interviews and a lot of fans.

289
00:18:26,373 --> 00:18:28,534
Also want to note that I guess I had like 10...

290
00:18:29,887 --> 00:18:35,951
be like an enemy in the game and five of them were black people

291
00:18:36,012 --> 00:18:38,233
who were like, yeah, I want to really support this game. This

292
00:18:38,273 --> 00:18:41,496
is a guy that I barely know. He's in my friend circle. He

293
00:18:41,856 --> 00:18:44,879
works a part-time job. He doesn't have money. He really

294
00:18:44,939 --> 00:18:51,024
likes Sprite. And when he saw this picture, he wanted to cry.

295
00:18:51,204 --> 00:18:53,646
He was like, holy shit, I'm in a video game. That's really

296
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:55,027
awesome. And

297
00:18:56,748 --> 00:19:01,410
there's a gentleman in the front seat who I met online through

298
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:05,392
this game because he was like, yeah, brown people, sure, this

299
00:19:05,412 --> 00:19:09,013
game looks dope. And it's like, yeah, people had this genre

300
00:19:09,053 --> 00:19:11,134
interest, but then they were also like, oh, this guy is

301
00:19:11,174 --> 00:19:14,415
tackling these interesting issues, too. And I mean, so

302
00:19:14,475 --> 00:19:17,696
like also like different games and the feminist gaming

303
00:19:17,716 --> 00:19:20,917
Illuminati logos are in there, along other ones, because

304
00:19:20,957 --> 00:19:22,178
people were like ‑‑

305
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:27,959
yeah, why not? It was a guy who backed at the logo thing and he

306
00:19:28,019 --> 00:19:30,461
said, hey, I thought a good thing would be to be the

307
00:19:30,621 --> 00:19:35,245
feminist gaming Illuminati and we talked it all out. And so

308
00:19:35,306 --> 00:19:38,108
like we were all on an e-mail chain to get permission to even

309
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:41,571
use the logo. And then it was like, yeah, so become friends

310
00:19:41,631 --> 00:19:46,135
over this whole thing. And kind of this thinking kind of created

311
00:19:46,176 --> 00:19:48,478
like weird systems dealing with

312
00:19:51,754 --> 00:19:55,356
dealing with oppression, like this class types, like you've

313
00:19:55,376 --> 00:19:58,298
got the main character right there who's fighting a cop and

314
00:19:58,338 --> 00:20:02,020
kind of a gentrifier in like the Lower East Side which is kind

315
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,982
of going through a lot of gentrification. And so then the

316
00:20:05,042 --> 00:20:08,204
class types like the cop is unbalanced. The gentrifier just

317
00:20:08,264 --> 00:20:12,207
makes her more powerful, which is kind of how the world works.

318
00:20:13,047 --> 00:20:15,869
But I also ran into a lot of stumbling blocks just in my own

319
00:20:15,909 --> 00:20:19,111
thinking because I guess of the way writing and thinking about

320
00:20:19,131 --> 00:20:21,012
stuff is like I had this problem where

321
00:20:21,893 --> 00:20:26,235
a lot of the brown people were, because I grew up in the hood,

322
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:29,696
and I know a lot of people that are in the hood, but I kind of defined them by the hood,

323
00:20:29,756 --> 00:20:33,578
whereas I defined all the white people as more gentrifying,

324
00:20:33,598 --> 00:20:36,080
and that is, it's actually funny because my mom's white, and

325
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,561
she was labeled as a cop by all the Puerto Rican people in our

326
00:20:39,581 --> 00:20:42,243
neighborhood growing up because she was the only white person

327
00:20:42,263 --> 00:20:45,684
living there. But I had to actually rethink a lot of

328
00:20:45,724 --> 00:20:49,486
people's backgrounds and pull some people down and raise some

329
00:20:49,506 --> 00:20:53,048
people up because you can't just define certain people by where

330
00:20:53,088 --> 00:20:55,969
they're from and you can't define people by where they move

331
00:20:56,029 --> 00:20:59,211
and what their intentions are. And then also there's this

332
00:20:59,251 --> 00:21:02,833
character who I specifically had a problem with where like I

333
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:12,331
defined her kind of by the street harassment that she would get and that was really weird. So I

334
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:20,056
sat down one day and I was like, man, this is bad. So I kind of actually thought about her as

335
00:21:20,096 --> 00:21:24,258
like, because I actually modeled her like sprites after Wolverine in X-Men versus Street Fighter.

336
00:21:24,278 --> 00:21:28,660
So then I thought about maybe she liked comics a lot and that like, you know, she was

337
00:21:34,144 --> 00:21:37,927
you know, kind of like what happens in life, a bad thing happens and you get suspended from

338
00:21:37,967 --> 00:21:42,371
school and then you're like, you know, fuck this school. So then that was more like of an

339
00:21:42,411 --> 00:21:45,834
empowering thing, like she was a super smart person that just kind of got screwed over by

340
00:21:45,874 --> 00:21:50,618
everything. So because I always wanted to make the enemies have some sort of redeeming quality

341
00:21:50,678 --> 00:21:55,162
because that's also a problem with games is that you just mow down all these people that don't

342
00:21:55,202 --> 00:21:55,402
matter.

343
00:21:58,543 --> 00:22:00,624
Great, so I'm also going to be a little vain.

344
00:22:02,084 --> 00:22:04,265
So Prism Shell is actually a game

345
00:22:04,285 --> 00:22:08,027
that I created with two friends at Brooklyn Gamery.

346
00:22:09,887 --> 00:22:11,648
And so we're actually native New Yorkers,

347
00:22:11,868 --> 00:22:13,269
and we're now all based in Brooklyn,

348
00:22:13,289 --> 00:22:15,169
which is how the name kind of came about.

349
00:22:15,289 --> 00:22:17,610
And we actually originally formed our group

350
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:19,971
because this game did really well at a hackathon,

351
00:22:19,991 --> 00:22:21,092
and we were like, yeah, let's go with it.

352
00:22:22,072 --> 00:22:25,513
So it's a mobile space shooter with a node-based mechanic,

353
00:22:25,533 --> 00:22:27,294
which you can kind of see here, you kind of jump around.

354
00:22:27,794 --> 00:22:30,818
and stuff like that and it was inspired by games like Gradius

355
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:34,283
but we wanted to do something for mobile and something with lasers.

356
00:22:34,663 --> 00:22:36,545
So, yay! Yay lasers!

357
00:22:37,727 --> 00:22:40,590
But the other thing about this game is that it stars a black woman

358
00:22:40,811 --> 00:22:43,574
and she's a pilot whose code name is Veretta.

359
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:46,335
Her inclusion is incredibly purposeful.

360
00:22:46,395 --> 00:22:50,357
I did that because I didn't see a lot of black women in space.

361
00:22:50,597 --> 00:22:51,837
Like, who does that?

362
00:22:52,797 --> 00:22:55,898
So I wanted to specifically have a black woman who's a pilot,

363
00:22:55,978 --> 00:22:57,959
who's determined, but not angry.

364
00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:01,260
I specifically also made her face to look confident,

365
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,920
but not in that way where it's like traditional angry black

366
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,361
woman.

367
00:23:04,401 --> 00:23:05,261
She knows her stuff.

368
00:23:06,441 --> 00:23:08,222
And I also did write about the experience

369
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:09,782
of designing her for Offworld.

370
00:23:10,323 --> 00:23:15,490
So, something that was bad that I kind of did was originally the

371
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:19,155
character was way lighter skinned and that was because

372
00:23:19,576 --> 00:23:21,859
there was like this article that came out that was like, oh, in

373
00:23:21,879 --> 00:23:24,944
the future people are going to be like racially ambiguous and

374
00:23:24,964 --> 00:23:26,105
they're going to look kind of like this.

375
00:23:26,586 --> 00:23:30,987
And then I kept thinking about it and I was like, why does whiteness equal the future?

376
00:23:31,007 --> 00:23:38,229
And so I just really decided to say, like, it doesn't matter what we think the future is going to look like.

377
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:41,750
Here's what my version of the future is like.

378
00:23:42,331 --> 00:23:48,112
Here's my example of a black woman in space, you know, in like a hundred, two hundred, a thousand years.

379
00:23:48,452 --> 00:23:52,233
And the sad thing also was that in order to launch the game without...

380
00:23:52,573 --> 00:23:57,456
eventually hating ourselves. We needed to kind of cut a lot of features because the game just grew in

381
00:23:57,496 --> 00:24:03,238
scale to a point where it was just basically impossible to finish with the three of us in the

382
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:09,141
time that we had allotted. So we cut the story, but we still wanted to actually show the main

383
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:14,983
character. So we have her on the title screen, which is also kind of a throwback to games from

384
00:24:15,064 --> 00:24:19,245
like 20 years ago where, you know, they would have a ship and you might have a person who was

385
00:24:19,285 --> 00:24:20,206
like on the box art.

386
00:24:20,766 --> 00:24:24,267
and they were that main character, you knew they were in the ship, so you always know that

387
00:24:24,387 --> 00:24:26,807
Beretta is in there, she's a black woman, she's saving the world.

388
00:24:28,828 --> 00:24:30,008
We also actually put her

389
00:24:30,488 --> 00:24:33,869
in the trailer, and this is something we want to add in later as well in the

390
00:24:33,929 --> 00:24:34,549
actual game,

391
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:38,470
because we want to just underscore again, this is the person who's operating the

392
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:39,010
ship and

393
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:42,031
even though we didn't have time to actually include her background, she's

394
00:24:42,051 --> 00:24:44,251
still there and she's still incredibly important.

395
00:24:45,132 --> 00:24:50,438
Now, the other thing that this actually did was it actually invited a lot of people who

396
00:24:51,019 --> 00:24:54,564
might not have played this type of game to come over and try it out.

397
00:24:54,624 --> 00:24:59,470
We had a lot of kids, a lot of women, and older people as well who were super interested

398
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:01,192
in just trying out this game.

399
00:25:01,432 --> 00:25:02,193
And it was also very...

400
00:25:03,334 --> 00:25:06,776
interesting to learn how to design like an interaction curve that older people

401
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:10,679
could understand. Not that all old people can't understand things obviously, but

402
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:14,021
sometimes some people come in and they're like, oh I haven't tried a mobile

403
00:25:14,041 --> 00:25:17,523
game before, how does this work? So we wanted to kind of make it as inclusive

404
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:20,645
as possible to people. So we did a lot of playtesting and we just realized that

405
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:24,528
having this character on the main screen also made it very interesting to a lot

406
00:25:24,568 --> 00:25:25,128
of different people.

407
00:25:26,029 --> 00:25:38,745
So it shows that even if your game isn't necessarily narrative driven, just by having certain character choices, you can actually open your audience and kind of excite people and draw people into your game.

408
00:25:39,837 --> 00:25:44,320
So what we're going to do in the future is the next version of Prison Shell, which we're going to work on.

409
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:49,703
We actually have already started designing her narrative and expanding upon who Beretta is.

410
00:25:50,963 --> 00:25:55,406
And the game, the first version of the game didn't do 100% well.

411
00:25:55,426 --> 00:25:58,908
Like we got a lot of great press and things like that, but we weren't working with a marketing team.

412
00:25:59,328 --> 00:26:05,011
So the main reason that it didn't do super well was because we didn't really know how marketing worked yet.

413
00:26:05,171 --> 00:26:07,453
And so we learned a lot in that regard as well.

414
00:26:10,597 --> 00:26:14,701
Also just to add that like part of the underscoring is that it was like people

415
00:26:14,721 --> 00:26:17,804
are like man you know brown woman in front of the game that's why I didn't sell

416
00:26:17,844 --> 00:26:22,728
but you know it's like people often need to realize that like white dude

417
00:26:22,768 --> 00:26:25,991
first-person shooters often don't sell there's a lot of them that you've never

418
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:26,272
heard of

419
00:26:28,577 --> 00:26:32,319
So I guess our conclusions, so creating characters from diverse

420
00:26:32,379 --> 00:26:36,682
backgrounds can invite, include and intrigue people who often

421
00:26:36,722 --> 00:26:39,263
don't see themselves represented. It can make your

422
00:26:39,303 --> 00:26:44,286
work stand out in this industry where, you know, it's really

423
00:26:44,346 --> 00:26:49,409
hard to actually sell things these days. And it also helps

424
00:26:49,509 --> 00:26:52,010
out in this industry where there's all these defaults,

425
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:54,712
right? People just think of these defaults. And even if you

426
00:26:54,772 --> 00:26:57,533
don't see color, others do. And we all have.

427
00:26:59,066 --> 00:27:04,508
hand and you have to have we all have to have a hand in making games more inclusive because it can't just be like

428
00:27:04,568 --> 00:27:10,211
The brown people and the women making the brown people in the women games because maybe we also want to make like weird

429
00:27:10,691 --> 00:27:16,613
Shape things that are like one-dimensional and that are installations that aren't about the diverse experience

430
00:27:16,653 --> 00:27:18,874
So someone else needs to do that occasionally, too

431
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:24,203
And you know, we're indies, and that means that, you know, we're not locked into this

432
00:27:24,263 --> 00:27:29,109
triple A hell where we can't change our work, what we do drastically, we can be more agile,

433
00:27:29,289 --> 00:27:32,313
we can create characters that are better, and we really should.

434
00:27:32,894 --> 00:27:35,838
There needs to really be no more games that star all white people.

435
00:27:36,939 --> 00:27:38,979
we should be thinking deeper about the motives for our

436
00:27:39,019 --> 00:27:42,080
characters. Like how can our characters inform our game

437
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,822
design and vice versa. And we're urging that when people make

438
00:27:45,862 --> 00:27:48,643
games that we think about different settings, places and

439
00:27:48,683 --> 00:27:51,984
people who star in our games and also avoid accidentally upholding

440
00:27:52,024 --> 00:27:57,706
oppressive systems while doing so. But we need everybody to be

441
00:27:58,026 --> 00:28:01,167
thinking differently. You can make a game about dogs and cats

442
00:28:01,227 --> 00:28:04,608
that uphold systemic racism. It's actually kind of easy.

443
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:11,782
Yep. Yeah, so the next bit, we're just going to kind of

444
00:28:12,043 --> 00:28:15,205
shout out some games really quick to check out that are,

445
00:28:15,465 --> 00:28:17,206
you know, kind of interesting, doing a pretty good job.

446
00:28:19,408 --> 00:28:22,210
So Moon Hunters, this actually just launched on Steam. It

447
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:26,113
starts in ancient Mesopotamian lore and it has a lot of brown

448
00:28:26,153 --> 00:28:28,835
people in it. I don't know why, but people seem to make games

449
00:28:28,895 --> 00:28:30,676
about the cradle of civilization make them all white.

450
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:34,240
Not anymore. Not anymore.

451
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:37,822
Read Only Memories, also really interesting, awesome.

452
00:28:38,042 --> 00:28:42,585
And by MidBoss, the people behind GamerX, which is now GX.

453
00:28:42,925 --> 00:28:44,926
So this was Kickstarter-supported,

454
00:28:45,567 --> 00:28:48,128
and it's got a lot of really interesting, diverse characters.

455
00:28:48,869 --> 00:28:51,530
I'm looking forward to seeing how they handle voice acting for them.

456
00:28:54,321 --> 00:28:57,425
know, if you don't know this game, this game is from

457
00:28:57,545 --> 00:29:00,227
Cameroon in Africa. They've actually done a couple of

458
00:29:00,267 --> 00:29:03,631
kick starters. The second one was successful thankfully. I

459
00:29:04,252 --> 00:29:06,794
don't know. It's a very interesting game and we often

460
00:29:06,854 --> 00:29:11,819
don't see games set in African fantasy. It's a little sad that

461
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:14,842
it has to be an African team that is doing it, but at least

462
00:29:15,002 --> 00:29:16,164
people are actually supporting them.

463
00:29:18,334 --> 00:29:21,655
and Undertale which is also another kick starter game. The

464
00:29:21,675 --> 00:29:24,957
reason I liked this one was clear choices made regarding

465
00:29:25,037 --> 00:29:28,880
gender and skin color so like the main character doesn't really

466
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,241
have very much of a gender. A lot of people are referred to or

467
00:29:32,261 --> 00:29:35,063
like a lot of characters are referred to as they. The

468
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:38,405
character has brown skin and it's super interesting. Although

469
00:29:39,065 --> 00:29:41,547
then gendering some of the characters was kind of like hmm

470
00:29:41,727 --> 00:29:44,688
but overall it was a really interesting quirky narrative

471
00:29:44,728 --> 00:29:46,930
game that definitely made me think a little bit.

472
00:29:48,613 --> 00:29:48,973
Thanks.

473
00:29:48,993 --> 00:29:59,420
Thank you.
