00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:17,112
My name is Adam Kuda and I'm the community marketing specialist for Shell Games.

2
00:00:19,855 --> 00:00:25,537
I am so honored to be here presenting for GDC, first time GDC presenter, and really

3
00:00:25,597 --> 00:00:26,578
excited to get talking.

4
00:00:27,738 --> 00:00:33,780
Today we're going to be talking about expanding a single player game to a multiplayer experience

5
00:00:33,961 --> 00:00:34,821
using Discord.

6
00:00:35,281 --> 00:00:40,322
Now, I do need to preface and say that we are not sponsored by Discord, and anything

7
00:00:40,362 --> 00:00:44,604
that you learn from this presentation does not have to be applied using Discord.

8
00:00:44,624 --> 00:00:47,124
You can use other platforms.

9
00:00:47,544 --> 00:00:51,005
We've just found that Discord resonates really well with our community.

10
00:00:51,245 --> 00:00:54,606
So feel free to enjoy that knowledge.

11
00:00:56,824 --> 00:01:03,651
All right, so let me dive in by telling you guys a little bit about me and who I am, why you should

12
00:01:03,691 --> 00:01:09,517
listen to me, right? So like I said, my name is Adam Kuda and I'm the Community Marketing Specialist

13
00:01:09,597 --> 00:01:10,558
for Shell Games.

14
00:01:11,199 --> 00:01:14,221
Now, my background is in community.

15
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:20,545
I graduated from Full Sail University with a creative writing for entertainment degree,

16
00:01:20,965 --> 00:01:26,569
then got into some customer support roles, consumer insights and analytics, social media,

17
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:30,792
and all that kind of blended together to get me to marketing where I am today.

18
00:01:31,732 --> 00:01:38,454
Now currently I manage the social media channels and the community for Shell Games original IP.

19
00:01:38,934 --> 00:01:44,436
So games like I Expect You to Die and Until You Fall, which we'll get into just a little bit.

20
00:01:44,956 --> 00:01:51,578
But most importantly, sorry, but most importantly I am Jade's dad.

21
00:01:52,118 --> 00:01:56,079
And Jade is my adorable little puppy who you'll get to know in a little bit.

22
00:01:57,595 --> 00:01:59,596
Let's next talk about Shell Games.

23
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:03,418
Now this isn't a pitch for our studio, but I thought a little context would help.

24
00:02:03,898 --> 00:02:08,201
So Shell Games is an independent studio that's been around for almost 20 years.

25
00:02:08,501 --> 00:02:13,203
We were founded by the brilliant mind of Jesse Shell, who literally wrote the book about

26
00:02:13,243 --> 00:02:13,824
game design.

27
00:02:14,264 --> 00:02:15,945
So definitely worth checking out.

28
00:02:16,505 --> 00:02:17,086
Awesome man.

29
00:02:17,606 --> 00:02:18,346
Now, um...

30
00:02:19,513 --> 00:02:27,055
As a studio, we have produced and worked on and developed many numerous variety of projects

31
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:34,437
from client-based projects to location-based experiences at museums and theme parks, and

32
00:02:34,517 --> 00:02:35,957
of course, our original IP.

33
00:02:36,377 --> 00:02:40,698
But we're going to be focusing on those original IP now, so let me introduce the first one

34
00:02:40,738 --> 00:02:42,879
to you, which is I Expect You to Die.

35
00:02:43,299 --> 00:02:52,821
Now I Expect You To Die came out in 2017 and it is a VR escape room puzzle game that has a kind of

36
00:02:53,041 --> 00:03:02,443
humorous and witty James Bond spy aesthetic going on right now. It is highly praised as a must-try

37
00:03:02,543 --> 00:03:09,044
VR experience and a lot of the community consider it one of the best introductions to the VR platform.

38
00:03:09,444 --> 00:03:09,564
So

39
00:03:10,834 --> 00:03:13,515
This isn't me being biased, it's actually community talk.

40
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:18,616
I highly recommend it though, just for the opening theme song alone.

41
00:03:18,996 --> 00:03:20,376
So definitely check it out.

42
00:03:21,537 --> 00:03:25,798
In addition, I Expect You to Die 2 is going to be coming out later this year.

43
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:28,058
So you know, there's that fun fact.

44
00:03:29,339 --> 00:03:32,700
The next game that we're going to be talking about is Until You Fall.

45
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:41,603
And Until You Fall is another VR game that we made and it's a sword fighting roguelite experience

46
00:03:41,743 --> 00:03:50,107
that has this neon synth wave like energetic aesthetic and it's all about being a badass

47
00:03:50,127 --> 00:03:54,248
sword fighter and taking down monsters. How can you beat that?

48
00:03:55,163 --> 00:03:58,125
Now, this came out of early access just last year,

49
00:03:58,865 --> 00:04:00,225
and because of that,

50
00:04:00,525 --> 00:04:04,587
community has been such an important part of its growth and development,

51
00:04:04,887 --> 00:04:07,728
which is why we have such a heavy emphasis on it now.

52
00:04:09,388 --> 00:04:12,229
Okay, enough of the plugs in the context.

53
00:04:12,509 --> 00:04:14,610
Let's talk about why you guys are actually here, right?

54
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,472
So how are we turning this single-player game

55
00:04:18,632 --> 00:04:20,172
into a multiplayer experience?

56
00:04:20,672 --> 00:04:23,353
Well, let me introduce you all to the Jade Method.

57
00:04:24,506 --> 00:04:27,447
Okay, I admit I'm way too obsessed with my puppy. It's fine.

58
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:35,253
So the J-th method. This is how I form all of my challenges and how I've kind of

59
00:04:35,993 --> 00:04:37,534
the method to my madness, right?

60
00:04:38,475 --> 00:04:41,296
We're gonna start with the first step which is jumping to conclusions.

61
00:04:41,657 --> 00:04:46,440
I know it's a little weird to have the first step be about conclusions, right?

62
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,821
But it's it's the basis of my madness.

63
00:04:50,285 --> 00:04:54,089
So what I want you to do is to make an assumption about your community.

64
00:04:54,149 --> 00:04:58,073
Something broad, something specific, just any kind of jump to a conclusion.

65
00:04:58,613 --> 00:05:02,497
So for example, something like, my community favors competition.

66
00:05:02,917 --> 00:05:04,018
Something as simple as that.

67
00:05:04,559 --> 00:05:08,643
So you need to jump to your conclusion, and then after you have that conclusion,

68
00:05:09,023 --> 00:05:10,764
we're going to apply some action to it, right?

69
00:05:11,245 --> 00:05:14,667
We want to form an activity or a challenge or a quest

70
00:05:15,228 --> 00:05:18,770
that really, like, compliments that conclusion that you have

71
00:05:19,411 --> 00:05:21,632
or that totally challenges it.

72
00:05:22,153 --> 00:05:25,575
For me, personally, I like to either amplify that conclusion by 100

73
00:05:26,356 --> 00:05:29,858
or totally turn it on its head and test the waters.

74
00:05:29,938 --> 00:05:31,479
It's fun experiments, right?

75
00:05:32,492 --> 00:05:36,957
Now the third step is data gather and listen.

76
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:39,639
We don't want to wait until the end of our activity

77
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,142
after we started it to see what's going on with it.

78
00:05:42,182 --> 00:05:44,584
We want to be watching the results as they happen.

79
00:05:45,085 --> 00:05:46,226
Who's participating?

80
00:05:46,426 --> 00:05:47,607
What are they focusing on?

81
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:50,970
How is the community working together?

82
00:05:51,091 --> 00:05:53,293
Or what are they most competing for?

83
00:05:55,495 --> 00:05:59,844
A key aspect to quality community management is listening.

84
00:06:00,105 --> 00:06:01,588
That's the most important part.

85
00:06:01,989 --> 00:06:05,477
So if there's anything that you take away from this presentation, it should be that.

86
00:06:07,149 --> 00:06:10,549
And then finally, the last step of the JAID process

87
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:12,270
is to evaluate and learn.

88
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,710
After the activity is completed, we're

89
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:17,351
going to see how it held up against your conclusion.

90
00:06:17,671 --> 00:06:20,892
Did it prove or disprove your hypothesis?

91
00:06:21,232 --> 00:06:23,652
Like, what actually happened, right?

92
00:06:24,153 --> 00:06:26,773
As you continue to do more and more of these challenges,

93
00:06:27,073 --> 00:06:30,274
you'll have much more quantitative and hopefully

94
00:06:30,334 --> 00:06:32,414
qualitative information that you can kind of compare

95
00:06:32,454 --> 00:06:32,975
between them.

96
00:06:33,475 --> 00:06:35,615
And this is really, really important.

97
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:43,403
because these evaluations will hopefully lead you to some new conclusions that can then continue that cycle.

98
00:06:44,544 --> 00:06:45,405
Rinse and repeat.

99
00:06:46,487 --> 00:06:46,747
So,

100
00:06:47,588 --> 00:06:51,032
basically, I just explained the scientific method,

101
00:06:51,732 --> 00:06:53,955
which we probably learned in high school. So,

102
00:06:55,885 --> 00:06:58,806
There's that, but it's totally fine.

103
00:06:59,366 --> 00:07:04,647
Let me now kind of show you an example of this in process.

104
00:07:05,147 --> 00:07:08,448
So with an actual challenge that I issued

105
00:07:09,789 --> 00:07:11,989
for the I Expect You to Die Discord server.

106
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:16,350
Now, this is actually what I did as we were planning to launch

107
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,691
I Expect You to Die's Discord server.

108
00:07:19,411 --> 00:07:22,271
As I mentioned, I Expect You to Die came out several years ago,

109
00:07:22,511 --> 00:07:25,252
but we only just started our Discord this year.

110
00:07:26,152 --> 00:07:36,916
So our goal of this kind of challenge, not the conclusion, but the goal was to gather all of our community into one space, this Discord,

111
00:07:37,516 --> 00:07:38,876
and how was I going to be able to do that?

112
00:07:38,936 --> 00:07:43,958
Well, the conclusion that I drew was that social media is our strongest reach.

113
00:07:44,278 --> 00:07:51,721
So I'm going to really hone all of my efforts and focus my efforts into getting the word out and raising attention via Twitter.

114
00:07:52,001 --> 00:07:54,321
Was my main focus, right? That was my main priority.

115
00:07:55,122 --> 00:08:03,809
So I really wanted to use Twitter to get my, to get our followers to be interested in this Discord.

116
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:10,435
So the next step was applying action. So what I did is on National Morse Code Day,

117
00:08:10,455 --> 00:08:15,019
or National Learn Morse Code Day, I posted a Morse Code Key.

118
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:22,011
And this is a simple and innocent enough post, and you know, we're a spy-based puzzle game,

119
00:08:22,071 --> 00:08:23,612
so it didn't seem too out of the ordinary.

120
00:08:23,953 --> 00:08:32,139
But I followed this up by posting daily messages that hid Morse code letters in their content.

121
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,662
And some of these letters were really not...

122
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:43,727
hidden. They're blatantly in your face and in plain sight. So I was hoping that doing that

123
00:08:44,127 --> 00:08:49,794
would really spark some attention of our Twitter followers. And additionally,

124
00:08:51,635 --> 00:08:58,543
each of these letters would... Okay, let me back up one second. So the...

125
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:05,312
the letters then, players would find the letters and it would spell out the link for the invite

126
00:09:05,353 --> 00:09:07,194
code for our Discord server.

127
00:09:07,534 --> 00:09:11,818
So each of these posts had the next letter for that invite code.

128
00:09:12,138 --> 00:09:15,301
They didn't know that it was for an invite code, but they knew that it was something,

129
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:15,781
right?

130
00:09:16,242 --> 00:09:21,086
And in addition to this, to get even more eyes on it, for some of those posts, I tagged

131
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:25,890
content creators on the original content of that post to not only pull in

132
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:30,833
our followers, but also the followers of content creators who had made content for our game.

133
00:09:31,353 --> 00:09:37,017
So trying to really capitalize on that Twitter aspect, right? And I really expected the community

134
00:09:37,037 --> 00:09:43,362
to pick up on these hidden letters and work together to decipher it. Well, using the third

135
00:09:43,442 --> 00:09:49,166
step, data gathering and listening, I found out that it wasn't Twitter where the conversation

136
00:09:49,206 --> 00:09:52,568
was sparking, but instead on our Until You Fall Discord.

137
00:09:53,089 --> 00:09:59,471
Now this worked so well in my favor because not only was it raising attention to the I Expect You

138
00:09:59,511 --> 00:10:04,773
to Die going ons and the fact that something was happening on our Until You Fall server,

139
00:10:05,474 --> 00:10:11,476
but people were coming from social media to our Until You Fall server, which was a win,

140
00:10:11,936 --> 00:10:18,599
and then talking about it on the I Expect You to Die channel of our Discord server. It was

141
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,941
awesome waterfall of events that I

142
00:10:22,802 --> 00:10:31,690
It was great. So that led to finally the end of our reveal and we, the players figured out that

143
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:35,653
it was a Discord invite link and they joined the server right away and then a couple days later

144
00:10:35,673 --> 00:10:42,639
we officially posted the link so people who didn't do the the hidden code were able to

145
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:47,564
join the community and it was time to evaluate and learn the final step of the Jade process.

146
00:10:48,124 --> 00:10:55,067
So what I learned from this was that creating a discord was absolutely the best case scenario for us.

147
00:10:55,567 --> 00:11:00,709
Not only did this campaign really prove that discord was a place that they liked to gather

148
00:11:00,729 --> 00:11:06,311
to communicate with each other, but it was now available for the I Expect You To Die community

149
00:11:06,371 --> 00:11:09,432
as well as our Until You Fall one, so it was just kind of wins all around.

150
00:11:10,473 --> 00:11:14,996
But in addition to that, it really stressed and highlighted

151
00:11:15,436 --> 00:11:17,697
that our players loved solving puzzles.

152
00:11:18,238 --> 00:11:20,879
Now, this isn't I Expect You to Die server,

153
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,921
which is a puzzle game, so that really shouldn't be surprising.

154
00:11:25,022 --> 00:11:27,003
But what was a little surprising,

155
00:11:27,123 --> 00:11:29,085
and maybe not surprising but exciting,

156
00:11:29,505 --> 00:11:33,467
was their joy and how much they embraced

157
00:11:33,487 --> 00:11:35,949
the idea of working together for these solutions.

158
00:11:36,589 --> 00:11:42,013
And since then, that led me to a new hypothesis or conclusion

159
00:11:42,394 --> 00:11:46,417
that the players like working together to solve complex challenges.

160
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:51,000
So since then, we've continued to do hidden message posts

161
00:11:51,381 --> 00:11:54,243
and campaigns and puzzles for our community

162
00:11:54,843 --> 00:11:57,425
on a nearly monthly basis that have gone over very well.

163
00:11:58,649 --> 00:12:02,172
Okay, so where's all the multiplayer talk on this?

164
00:12:02,592 --> 00:12:05,014
Like, cool, you made a Discord, awesome.

165
00:12:05,394 --> 00:12:10,218
Okay, well, I can go on with the same jade cycle breakdown

166
00:12:10,578 --> 00:12:12,480
for all of the challenges that I've issued,

167
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,641
but I'm imagining that you probably get the point.

168
00:12:15,162 --> 00:12:17,384
So now I kind of want to focus in

169
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:19,946
on potential different types of challenges

170
00:12:19,966 --> 00:12:21,627
that you can issue that really implement

171
00:12:21,667 --> 00:12:22,708
multiplayer elements,

172
00:12:23,268 --> 00:12:24,769
even though the games are single player.

173
00:12:25,616 --> 00:12:31,630
now uh for this i'm gonna switch gears and we're gonna focus on until you fall instead of i expect

174
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:32,111
you to die

175
00:12:33,847 --> 00:12:38,292
So in my mind, there are two different branches of multiplayer challenges,

176
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:42,796
cooperative and competitive. Let's talk about cooperative first.

177
00:12:43,357 --> 00:12:46,620
So cooperative challenges bring the players together

178
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:50,383
and they can work as a team for a common goal,

179
00:12:50,664 --> 00:12:57,110
right? Cooperative. So of this type, there are two potential

180
00:12:58,704 --> 00:13:05,210
challenge branches, so to say. The collection branch and the player pairing branch.

181
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:13,296
So let's focus in on the collection branch right now. As an example, in November of 2020,

182
00:13:13,336 --> 00:13:18,881
around Thanksgiving, we hosted the Spirit of Giving Challenge. Now let me give you some

183
00:13:18,921 --> 00:13:20,682
context on how this challenge worked.

184
00:13:21,363 --> 00:13:25,045
Essentially, in Until You Fall, players can earn Aether,

185
00:13:25,345 --> 00:13:29,348
which is this in-game resource that you use to upgrade your weapons

186
00:13:29,428 --> 00:13:30,609
or to purchase new weapons.

187
00:13:31,429 --> 00:13:35,151
And as you progress through the game and you finish a game,

188
00:13:35,812 --> 00:13:37,353
as you end your play session,

189
00:13:38,133 --> 00:13:41,856
there's a results screen that shows how much Aether you have gained

190
00:13:41,976 --> 00:13:42,856
through your run.

191
00:13:44,077 --> 00:13:47,359
And that is something that always happens, right?

192
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:49,580
Well, players are kind of starting to...

193
00:13:50,701 --> 00:13:52,723
dismiss Aether, right?

194
00:13:52,763 --> 00:13:56,507
Like they, I was noticing that no one was really picking it up

195
00:13:56,587 --> 00:13:58,630
and people were, you know, talking like, oh, you know, like,

196
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:00,832
I've unlocked all the weapons, so what do I do with it?

197
00:14:00,872 --> 00:14:02,434
Like, we need something to do with Aether.

198
00:14:02,774 --> 00:14:06,898
So I was like, okay, well, let's turn this, that was my, my, my conclusion

199
00:14:06,998 --> 00:14:09,081
was that Aether needed a new purpose, right?

200
00:14:09,121 --> 00:14:10,242
Like, players are sick of Aether.

201
00:14:10,682 --> 00:14:13,104
So how can I spin that on its head, right?

202
00:14:13,384 --> 00:14:15,645
So the action I took was issuing this challenge,

203
00:14:15,665 --> 00:14:16,465
the spirit of giving.

204
00:14:16,846 --> 00:14:18,226
So how the challenge worked

205
00:14:18,647 --> 00:14:21,969
is that players would submit their results screen

206
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:26,251
and I would add all of their Aether values together

207
00:14:26,351 --> 00:14:28,672
into this community pool value.

208
00:14:29,393 --> 00:14:32,114
Now this isn't reflected in the game in any way.

209
00:14:32,134 --> 00:14:34,135
It was only on our Discord server.

210
00:14:35,136 --> 00:14:38,298
So, sorry.

211
00:14:44,044 --> 00:14:50,329
So they would pool together their aether and there was this reward, this chance to reward.

212
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:55,412
If you participated you were entered into a raffle and the more that the more aether that

213
00:14:55,432 --> 00:14:59,836
they collected and the more players that submitted to this contest the better the

214
00:14:59,876 --> 00:15:01,617
rewards and the more winners there would be.

215
00:15:02,097 --> 00:15:07,920
Now I had originally set a couple tiers of like, if you reach this threshold, you would

216
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,321
win this physical prize.

217
00:15:09,421 --> 00:15:13,022
And if you reach this threshold, you could win this physical prize.

218
00:15:13,563 --> 00:15:15,704
And that really motivated people.

219
00:15:16,774 --> 00:15:23,498
And I do want to stress, I mentioned physical prizes, but you don't have to do that.

220
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:31,022
We often use real-life swag and promo items, but literally our servers love emotes themed around

221
00:15:31,062 --> 00:15:36,885
our game. They love discord roles and acknowledgement. You don't have to go out

222
00:15:37,045 --> 00:15:41,447
and do full-blown physical items. You can reward players in other ways.

223
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,824
We've also, one of the other really cool rewards that we've done is we've rebranded our social

224
00:15:47,884 --> 00:15:54,810
media channels based on winners of a certain challenge, which I'll get into just a little

225
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:55,270
bit later.

226
00:15:56,191 --> 00:16:01,975
Anyway, this amplifying of the prizes and this working together in the spirit of giving

227
00:16:02,216 --> 00:16:02,716
challenge.

228
00:16:02,896 --> 00:16:03,517
Ha ha ha.

229
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:09,999
So that really sparked a drive to get people involved and to really work as a team.

230
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:15,442
And I actually ended up having to come up with new prizes because they surpassed the

231
00:16:15,482 --> 00:16:19,763
threshold of Aether that I originally expected, which is really exciting.

232
00:16:20,744 --> 00:16:21,644
Now the second...

233
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:28,951
branch of cooperative challenges are the player pairing challenges. Now these

234
00:16:30,131 --> 00:16:37,333
collection-based challenges focus on uniting the community. These ones really focus on pairing

235
00:16:37,373 --> 00:16:41,174
people together. I think more like couch co-op, right? Like it's a much more intimate connection.

236
00:16:44,355 --> 00:16:50,681
try this for the first time. I created the match made in Rokar challenge, which we hosted in

237
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:57,927
February of 2021. Now for this, players would find a partner to mirror their weapon sets while

238
00:16:57,967 --> 00:17:03,291
completing a run. So for example, in Until You Fall, you can pick weapons for your right and

239
00:17:03,311 --> 00:17:04,412
your left hand. So

240
00:17:04,872 --> 00:17:10,194
I would complete it with the Heart Splitter in my right hand and the Ritual Dagger in

241
00:17:10,234 --> 00:17:15,557
my left, and I would need to find a partner to do the Ritual Dagger in their right and

242
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:16,637
the Heart Splitter in their left.

243
00:17:16,897 --> 00:17:19,578
They'd have to find those pairs and that's how they would earn points, right?

244
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:23,340
Well this didn't work out very well for me, actually.

245
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:30,383
And a lot of players ended up opting to mirror themselves to get points instead of trying

246
00:17:30,403 --> 00:17:31,483
to pair with other players.

247
00:17:33,561 --> 00:17:37,984
Honestly, through the evaluation process and that Jade process that I mentioned,

248
00:17:38,965 --> 00:17:44,669
I really blame myself for this. A lot of the process was complicated and a little convoluted

249
00:17:44,749 --> 00:17:50,413
for earning points. So it was easier for them to just match with themselves than it was to

250
00:17:50,553 --> 00:17:55,617
try to find an actual partner. And this was something that kind of became relevant and,

251
00:17:55,857 --> 00:18:00,920
you know, noticed during the the D section of the Jade process where I was

252
00:18:01,843 --> 00:18:03,645
you know, data gathering and listening.

253
00:18:04,806 --> 00:18:09,549
But despite the failure of that conclusion,

254
00:18:09,569 --> 00:18:09,650
it's

255
00:18:12,214 --> 00:18:16,276
it's not to say that something like that couldn't actually work for our game. In fact,

256
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:22,118
the community themselves actually developed what they call the Puppet Master Mode, which is a

257
00:18:22,738 --> 00:18:28,660
perfect example of player pairing. Essentially, what they do is they all put on their headsets

258
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,941
and hop into Discord's voice chat and pair off. So they're in pairs.

259
00:18:33,482 --> 00:18:38,907
And in Until You Fall, when you reach the end of a level, you're presented with three random augments

260
00:18:39,167 --> 00:18:43,532
that can upgrade your skills as you progress through your play, right?

261
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:46,274
And they're randomly generated, so you don't know which ones you're going to get.

262
00:18:46,855 --> 00:18:50,398
Well, in the Puppet Master mode, you're paired with someone,

263
00:18:50,739 --> 00:18:55,764
and your partner then gets to pick which of those three that you have to take.

264
00:18:56,204 --> 00:18:59,406
So you can either be really friendly and give them the power-up that they need,

265
00:18:59,726 --> 00:19:01,707
or give them that boost and refill of health,

266
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:04,869
or you can be really cruel and give them something

267
00:19:04,889 --> 00:19:07,951
that is totally irrelevant for their weapon set or loadout.

268
00:19:08,471 --> 00:19:14,914
And it's a brilliant way of implementing that couch co-op experience

269
00:19:15,235 --> 00:19:17,416
into a single-player game.

270
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:20,918
And definitely worthy of noting in this presentation.

271
00:19:23,252 --> 00:19:28,416
Now on the opposite side of the coin we talked about collaborative well now we're going to be

272
00:19:28,436 --> 00:19:33,420
talking about competitive because let's face it we all have players and members in our community

273
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:40,425
who love to win. So let's start with the first branch of this because just like the

274
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:44,068
the cooperative challenges we also have two branches for competitives.

275
00:19:44,969 --> 00:19:49,893
So the first branch of this is factions, and this is kind of along the veins of like a

276
00:19:50,253 --> 00:19:56,959
like a Harry Potter house or a Pokemon Go team, right? Where do you belong? Like,

277
00:19:57,559 --> 00:20:03,424
you know, for the Horde! This immediately, joining one of these teams...

278
00:20:04,551 --> 00:20:11,516
instantly gives you ownership and some kind of camaraderie with your teammates. You have a sense

279
00:20:11,536 --> 00:20:16,720
of pride in being a part of this team and it's really something that we should capitalize on,

280
00:20:16,781 --> 00:20:24,146
right? However, I do want to kind of stress and iterate like part of the beauty of having

281
00:20:24,186 --> 00:20:27,849
these kind of teams is really playing up the fact of.

282
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:33,432
appealing to people's different interests, right? So for example, on the Until You Fall

283
00:20:33,472 --> 00:20:38,474
Discord server, we have four different factions. Each of the factions has their own primary color,

284
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:43,156
right? That's very different. Each of them has their own primary weapon combination, so that

285
00:20:43,557 --> 00:20:49,339
is appealing to their, you know, the gameplay side of things. And then each of them also have like a

286
00:20:49,659 --> 00:20:51,540
in-lore, um...

287
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,100
like mission statement, so to speak.

288
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:59,421
So this way we have three different ways

289
00:21:00,001 --> 00:21:05,403
that you can that players can feel attached to one of these factions.

290
00:21:05,763 --> 00:21:09,444
Either, hey, purple is my favorite color, so I'm going to be a soul tender.

291
00:21:09,844 --> 00:21:13,145
Or I really like the idea of standing up for order and balance.

292
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:15,645
So let me go into the room guard.

293
00:21:16,325 --> 00:21:24,547
or I really like the Heart Splitter, so I'm gonna join Unbroken. Like, there's a clear

294
00:21:25,387 --> 00:21:30,449
path for any type of player to instantly feel attached to one of these factions.

295
00:21:30,929 --> 00:21:36,190
Same is probably true for, you know, look at Pokemon Go. Do you like yellow? You can join

296
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:38,230
Team Instinct, you know? There's...

297
00:21:39,661 --> 00:21:44,242
There's multiple reasons and justifications for choosing each of the factions.

298
00:21:44,662 --> 00:21:51,944
Now, I'm getting a little sidetracked, but it's all important to say that there's a sense

299
00:21:51,964 --> 00:21:52,524
of pride.

300
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:55,584
There's a reason why these people pick these factions, right?

301
00:21:55,944 --> 00:21:56,965
And they're attached to them.

302
00:21:57,325 --> 00:22:01,586
So this helps immediately boost that competitive drive.

303
00:22:01,626 --> 00:22:04,186
You want your team to win.

304
00:22:05,046 --> 00:22:08,207
So capitalizing on that, these kind of challenges can...

305
00:22:09,386 --> 00:22:13,721
like really really drive that multiplayer experience right you're putting different

306
00:22:13,741 --> 00:22:15,969
teams it's it's team sports right.

307
00:22:17,225 --> 00:22:23,989
So when I do this, when I do faction challenges, I typically will have these challenges focus on

308
00:22:24,589 --> 00:22:30,793
each team focusing on obtaining the same result but they have different ways that they have to

309
00:22:30,853 --> 00:22:35,915
do them. Again capitalizing on those individual differences of the factions and really playing

310
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:41,038
that up but working towards the same goal. So there is that sense of I did this

311
00:22:42,139 --> 00:22:44,900
and I want to do this this way, so I'm going to join that team.

312
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,881
It seems to work really well,

313
00:22:46,961 --> 00:22:49,642
and we have a lot of people who are very dedicated to their teams,

314
00:22:49,962 --> 00:22:52,803
even if it's not the winning team, which is really, really exciting.

315
00:22:53,543 --> 00:22:56,805
Now, as a side comment, I did mention I'd bring this up again,

316
00:22:57,205 --> 00:22:59,206
but this is actually where we had that...

317
00:23:01,627 --> 00:23:06,590
that reward of rebranding our social media channels. We had a faction challenge where

318
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:11,132
one of the factions won and we rebranded our social media channels to be reflective of

319
00:23:11,393 --> 00:23:18,237
that team's colors and symbols and really, you know, promote that, hey, this faction won. And

320
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:23,140
that not only drove some interest to our Discord, but it also helped reward the players for free.

321
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:23,920
So pretty cool.

322
00:23:25,172 --> 00:23:30,695
Now the second branch of competitive challenges is the one that we all kind of expect for

323
00:23:30,735 --> 00:23:31,235
competitive.

324
00:23:31,315 --> 00:23:38,058
It's leaderboards, it's speed runs and endurance tests and skill assessments and who can get

325
00:23:38,078 --> 00:23:38,779
the most points.

326
00:23:38,859 --> 00:23:39,899
It's stuff like that, right?

327
00:23:39,939 --> 00:23:42,361
Like figuring out who is the best.

328
00:23:43,081 --> 00:23:46,442
And that is not something to be taken lightly.

329
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:50,883
There are so many competitive people, and that is absolutely

330
00:23:50,923 --> 00:23:54,745
an element of multiplayer play that you can implement in single player games.

331
00:23:54,885 --> 00:23:58,166
In fact, a lot of games build that in and have leaderboards

332
00:23:58,546 --> 00:24:01,747
for time trials and things like that built into their games.

333
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:04,588
But you don't have to have that built into your games.

334
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:07,929
You can implement that purely on your your community side, too.

335
00:24:08,749 --> 00:24:14,917
Now I have a strong example of this being our Hero of Rokar tournament. We hosted this in April 2000

336
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:23,228
sorry 2021 so just a couple months ago. We had 20 participants who entered and then narrowed it down

337
00:24:23,268 --> 00:24:24,530
into four finalists.

338
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:28,592
and they all had to compete in crazy and difficult challenges.

339
00:24:29,212 --> 00:24:31,413
And then we finally had our finals,

340
00:24:31,533 --> 00:24:33,374
which we broadcast on Discord.

341
00:24:33,674 --> 00:24:36,595
This is the first time that we'd ever done any kind of live,

342
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,557
well, it wasn't live, but it was a prerecorded broadcast.

343
00:24:39,857 --> 00:24:41,337
We did a Discord watch party.

344
00:24:41,357 --> 00:24:43,438
And it was the first time that we'd ever done

345
00:24:43,458 --> 00:24:45,219
a watch party on the Discord.

346
00:24:45,579 --> 00:24:48,300
So we were kind of expecting mixed results, right?

347
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:51,282
Well, it turns out we had 30 congruent viewers

348
00:24:51,642 --> 00:24:52,382
for this event.

349
00:24:52,722 --> 00:24:55,884
And all of them were just there to cheer on the finalists.

350
00:24:56,284 --> 00:24:57,844
And I mean, the finalists were there too,

351
00:24:57,924 --> 00:25:00,966
but we were all just there enjoying the competition

352
00:25:01,146 --> 00:25:02,406
and enjoying the event.

353
00:25:02,526 --> 00:25:03,427
And this was huge.

354
00:25:03,487 --> 00:25:06,648
This was great, for we had more participants in our watch party

355
00:25:06,888 --> 00:25:08,789
than we did in the challenge.

356
00:25:09,089 --> 00:25:13,151
So really, really proving that players may not necessarily

357
00:25:13,191 --> 00:25:17,213
be involved in the competitive spirit,

358
00:25:17,653 --> 00:25:21,955
but can join together for an event and celebration.

359
00:25:23,269 --> 00:25:28,919
Anyway, the final video was also uploaded to our YouTube channel and it has more than

360
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:33,927
300 views already, so even a couple months after, we're still getting engagement on it,

361
00:25:33,987 --> 00:25:35,510
which is really, really exciting.

362
00:25:37,421 --> 00:25:43,786
All right, so those are a couple examples of how you can use multiplayer elements for a single

363
00:25:43,826 --> 00:25:50,671
player game, but using the Jade process. Now I do want to really just take a couple minutes to

364
00:25:51,231 --> 00:25:57,276
emphasize the importance of the final step in the Jade process, which is evaluate and learn.

365
00:25:57,836 --> 00:26:03,581
So I broke it down into a couple segments here, into a couple points. First being measuring success.

366
00:26:03,961 --> 00:26:09,206
Now it's really important to track your participation and your elements and this can

367
00:26:09,666 --> 00:26:14,570
obviously this is going to depend on what kind of activities you have, how you're going to track

368
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:20,135
those. I'm a huge spreadsheet person so I have spreadsheets for literally every challenge I've

369
00:26:20,155 --> 00:26:20,635
ever issued.

370
00:26:22,317 --> 00:26:28,721
Anyway, but you can find information through this tracking that is really important, such

371
00:26:28,781 --> 00:26:32,664
as identifying players who have participated in every challenge.

372
00:26:33,104 --> 00:26:37,367
These are superfans, and those likely are going to keep participating.

373
00:26:38,168 --> 00:26:43,111
And if they stop participating, then maybe it's time to evaluate why, right?

374
00:26:44,052 --> 00:26:49,354
or you may notice that you get a lot of participants in challenges that are heavily

375
00:26:49,414 --> 00:26:56,058
competitive or heavily cooperative. So it's really important to track these and see what's

376
00:26:56,098 --> 00:27:01,881
resonating with your community, right? The next thing is to re-evaluate your strategies.

377
00:27:02,261 --> 00:27:06,325
So you want to of course start with a conclusion, so jump to conclusions, you know,

378
00:27:06,486 --> 00:27:12,352
J for the JADE process, and then while it's going you're going to be comparing the participation

379
00:27:12,372 --> 00:27:17,217
and engagement during the event. Remember this is the D of the JADE process which is to data gather.

380
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:24,424
I do want to stress not to ignore other factors and I have a good example of this.

381
00:27:25,945 --> 00:27:32,149
When I first started making challenges really heavily for our community, I issued the Rokari

382
00:27:32,209 --> 00:27:36,773
Safari which was a creative-based challenge prompting people to submit.

383
00:27:36,933 --> 00:27:43,777
fan art and take screenshots in game and really really focus on that creative aspect as opposed

384
00:27:43,797 --> 00:27:49,721
to skill. Well we didn't get a lot of participants. We got some really really cool entries,

385
00:27:50,081 --> 00:27:51,862
but it was mostly by the same people.

386
00:27:52,743 --> 00:27:57,008
and it was very, you know, very few in number.

387
00:27:57,688 --> 00:28:03,475
So I kind of dismiss this as like, yeah, the community just wants to focus on skill,

388
00:28:03,676 --> 00:28:06,980
and that's totally fine. Well, factors change.

389
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:14,842
and we launched the game out of Early Access, and then we launched the game on Quest, and we got a

390
00:28:15,022 --> 00:28:22,084
whole bunch of new Rune Knights joining the server. And I remember I brought up a video,

391
00:28:22,304 --> 00:28:26,965
or I brought up a challenge, or something along the lines of the Rokari Safari,

392
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,145
and all of these new members are like, wait a minute!

393
00:28:29,845 --> 00:28:35,048
we want to do this, we want creative challenges, why hasn't that happened again?

394
00:28:35,068 --> 00:28:40,831
And it just kind of goes to show that re-evaluating challenges that don't necessarily work

395
00:28:41,191 --> 00:28:47,395
in the past, that could be because different factors are in play or were in play. So always

396
00:28:47,455 --> 00:28:51,417
feel free to re-evaluate and go back to some of the ones that you've tried, even if they

397
00:28:51,437 --> 00:28:55,779
weren't necessarily a hit before because, you know, they might be now. So.

398
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,500
Don't dismiss that.

399
00:28:58,001 --> 00:29:01,023
And then the last thing that I'd like to point out is active listening.

400
00:29:01,383 --> 00:29:09,809
I mentioned it earlier that listening is absolutely the most important part of being a quality community manager.

401
00:29:10,289 --> 00:29:14,092
So, obviously, this is something I really need to stress.

402
00:29:15,913 --> 00:29:17,834
Now, listening can be done in a number of ways,

403
00:29:17,854 --> 00:29:20,236
whether that be lurking and evaluating feedback

404
00:29:20,476 --> 00:29:22,397
or providing actual surveys,

405
00:29:22,577 --> 00:29:24,819
literally asking your community

406
00:29:24,939 --> 00:29:26,560
what they liked about a challenge,

407
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,480
what they didn't like,

408
00:29:27,861 --> 00:29:29,622
what they wanna see in challenges.

409
00:29:29,662 --> 00:29:32,083
This can be very, very valuable information

410
00:29:32,423 --> 00:29:34,705
and there's no shame in asking, right?

411
00:29:35,085 --> 00:29:37,246
Sometimes the community doesn't know what they want,

412
00:29:37,426 --> 00:29:38,627
but sometimes they really do.

413
00:29:39,007 --> 00:29:41,269
So it's important to really keep that in mind.

414
00:29:41,889 --> 00:29:46,395
The other thing is, like I mentioned, the D step in the jade process.

415
00:29:47,096 --> 00:29:52,403
Definitely data gather during the activity that you release.

416
00:29:52,844 --> 00:29:54,846
They will let you know when they're too confused

417
00:29:54,987 --> 00:29:57,610
or when they just don't get it or when they want more.

418
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:00,093
And it's really important to capitalize on that.

419
00:30:01,369 --> 00:30:05,836
So again, here's just a quick slide summarizing the JAID process.

420
00:30:06,177 --> 00:30:11,866
Jump to conclusions, apply action, data gather and listen, and evaluate and learn.

421
00:30:14,513 --> 00:30:17,115
Thank you so much for joining me today.

422
00:30:17,135 --> 00:30:19,157

423
00:30:19,177 --> 00:30:22,640
I'm so excited that you guys chose to listen to me.

424
00:30:23,361 --> 00:30:26,163

to help you or to talk you through

428
00:30:36,012 --> 00:30:37,593
or to share pictures of my dog.

429
00:30:39,975 --> 00:30:44,118
Again, please don't hesitate and join our Discord servers.

430
