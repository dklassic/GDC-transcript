1
00:00:06,579 --> 00:00:09,542
Okay, so for the past three years,

2
00:00:09,562 --> 00:00:11,944
I was really hoping someone would take a photo

3
00:00:11,984 --> 00:00:14,105
of me giving that, but there's no screen here.

4
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:17,168
Anyway, for the past three years,

5
00:00:17,248 --> 00:00:20,090
I've been a researcher at IT University of Copenhagen,

6
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:22,412
and I've been writing a PhD dissertation

7
00:00:22,452 --> 00:00:25,375
about folk games, design theory, and computer games.

8
00:00:26,356 --> 00:00:29,438
But in addition to writing about and studying these games,

9
00:00:29,498 --> 00:00:32,141
I've also been making a bunch of digital games

10
00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:33,662
with my colleagues in Copenhagen.

11
00:00:34,637 --> 00:00:36,078
And so there's been a bunch of games.

12
00:00:36,118 --> 00:00:38,579
Some of the more popular ones are a Wiimote game

13
00:00:38,619 --> 00:00:39,780
called Darkroom Sex Game,

14
00:00:40,721 --> 00:00:41,741
a party game called Button,

15
00:00:41,761 --> 00:00:43,322
which we showed at IGF last year,

16
00:00:43,342 --> 00:00:45,403
and this year we're showing a game

17
00:00:45,463 --> 00:00:46,784
called Johann Sebastian Joust,

18
00:00:46,844 --> 00:00:48,605
which you can try on the show floor

19
00:00:49,086 --> 00:00:50,387
Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday

20
00:00:51,187 --> 00:00:52,608
for the PlayStation Move controller.

21
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:55,850
So actually, I have a secret to share.

22
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,651
What I really wanted to call this talk,

23
00:00:57,671 --> 00:00:59,152
but what kind of got vetoed,

24
00:00:59,352 --> 00:01:01,854
is doing ridiculous shit with technology.

25
00:01:02,655 --> 00:01:08,377
like, what I want to tell you in the next 20 minutes is, uh, like, why I, why would

26
00:01:08,397 --> 00:01:11,938
you want to do ridiculous shit with technology. So that's, that's really the, the point of

27
00:01:11,978 --> 00:01:18,000
this talk. Um, and so to start with a, like, a really discreet, a really clear example,

28
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:23,781
I want to do a live demonstration of, uh, a move game, uh, that I had done, uh, with

29
00:01:23,821 --> 00:01:29,003
David, uh, can I go over here, uh, who is also the composer of, uh, and sound designer

30
00:01:29,043 --> 00:01:30,263
for Proteus and Dyad.

31
00:01:30,975 --> 00:01:35,098
And so, yeah, David and I have been working on this really deliberately stupid installation game.

32
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:38,621
And that's what I want to show you really quickly.

33
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:40,563
Uh, okay. â™ª

34
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:48,910
Okay.

35
00:01:50,552 --> 00:01:53,394
So get in position, I'm going to come join you in a second.

36
00:01:53,474 --> 00:01:54,115
Actually, can you do me a...

37
00:01:54,315 --> 00:01:54,495
Oh.

38
00:01:56,557 --> 00:01:58,518
When I tell you, can you press enter on the...

39
00:01:59,179 --> 00:01:59,339
Okay.

40
00:01:59,617 --> 00:02:00,298
So here's how it works.

41
00:02:00,758 --> 00:02:02,600
And sorry, we're going to play over here because I need space.

42
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,801
So I hope everyone's, yeah, sorry.

43
00:02:05,562 --> 00:02:07,984
OK, so here's how it works.

44
00:02:08,164 --> 00:02:11,006
We each have a PlayStation Move controller tied to our butts.

45
00:02:11,787 --> 00:02:15,170
And we're going to be all on all fours.

46
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,051
And we're basically dogs.

47
00:02:17,772 --> 00:02:21,174
And we get more points the more we accelerate our controllers.

48
00:02:21,435 --> 00:02:22,836
But we're not allowed to touch it with our hands,

49
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:26,839
so we kind of have to shake our butts around and accelerate this.

50
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:27,680
Now.

51
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:32,570
Occasionally, some of the controllers will start flashing,

52
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,791
and that means you're vulnerable.

53
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:36,673
So if you can wrestle the person down and press one of their buttons,

54
00:02:36,713 --> 00:02:37,654
they lose a bunch of points.

55
00:02:38,334 --> 00:02:39,975
And then there's a little rest period.

56
00:02:40,015 --> 00:02:43,437
So you'll hear the music a little bit more calm, which we catch our breath,

57
00:02:43,898 --> 00:02:44,758
and then it's back at it.

58
00:02:44,978 --> 00:02:47,920
This will last only a minute, and the person with the most points wins.

59
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,921
So it's pretty simple.

60
00:02:49,801 --> 00:02:51,923
And it's a little violent.

61
00:02:52,563 --> 00:02:55,905
OK, so three, two, one, go.

62
00:04:20,018 --> 00:04:20,739
All right, David Winn! . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

63
00:04:49,174 --> 00:04:52,016
calm it down a little bit. I'm gonna play the Where's My Heart soundtrack in the back

64
00:04:53,216 --> 00:04:55,358
for some good, more calm vibes after that.

65
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:07,085
OK. Woo. Now I'm gonna give the rest of the talk

66
00:05:07,165 --> 00:05:12,588
out of breath, but that's good. OK. So I want to talk a little less about the

67
00:05:12,608 --> 00:05:17,691
game itself, but more the design thinking and the process that went into making that.

68
00:05:18,145 --> 00:05:22,787
really stupid, deliberately silly and violent installation games.

69
00:05:22,807 --> 00:05:28,990
So this summer my friend Joanna, pictured here, got to try some Swedish folk games in

70
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,790
the suburb of Gothenburg.

71
00:05:31,351 --> 00:05:34,712
And so she sent me some photos of these games she played.

72
00:05:35,572 --> 00:05:42,895
You can't see it entirely well in this photo, but she has a rod tied to a string from the

73
00:05:42,935 --> 00:05:43,576
back of her belt.

74
00:05:45,114 --> 00:05:48,316
She's not allowed to use her hands and she's trying to knock those beer cans off.

75
00:05:48,336 --> 00:05:52,159
There's a whole obstacle course of these beer cans on these little shelves.

76
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:57,683
And the cans are full of sand, so they're actually pretty tricky to knock down because they're quite

77
00:05:57,723 --> 00:06:02,966
heavy. And of course she can't use her hands, so she's trying to, in the best time possible,

78
00:06:03,066 --> 00:06:07,089
run around this obstacle course and with her butt knock these things over.

79
00:06:07,109 --> 00:06:13,814
There was a second similar game where there was a pen tied to the string.

80
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:18,330
and they were trying to insert them into this empty water bottle,

81
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,851
which is really tricky, right, because this pen is dangling around.

82
00:06:22,611 --> 00:06:26,292
Anyway, so she told me about these two games,

83
00:06:26,632 --> 00:06:30,353
and at the time I had been making Johann Sebastian Jaus for the Move Controller,

84
00:06:31,113 --> 00:06:32,693
and immediately when I heard about this, it was like,

85
00:06:33,253 --> 00:06:35,394
oh, okay, I know exactly what I'm going to do with this.

86
00:06:36,014 --> 00:06:42,255
And those are really the games that directly inspired that game you just saw there.

87
00:06:44,116 --> 00:06:47,539
So I would say those two games are what I would call folk games.

88
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,903
And here's another example, a more famous example, a game called Ninja,

89
00:06:53,823 --> 00:06:56,185
which I'm sure a lot of you have tried and played recently.

90
00:06:56,766 --> 00:06:59,728
It's like a playground game, and I won't explain the full thing,

91
00:07:00,308 --> 00:07:03,411
but you stand in a circle and you each get a turn,

92
00:07:03,551 --> 00:07:07,814
and you're trying to slap the hands of other people who can kind of dodge with their arms.

93
00:07:09,795 --> 00:07:12,958
It's okay. So what do I mean by calling all these things folk games?

94
00:07:13,978 --> 00:07:17,320
Okay, so a philosopher of games, play, and sport,

95
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,721
Henning Eichberg, who's based in Denmark,

96
00:07:20,522 --> 00:07:21,602
writes a lot about folk games.

97
00:07:21,662 --> 00:07:22,943
And he defines it, he says,

98
00:07:23,323 --> 00:07:24,664
there are traditional, ethnic,

99
00:07:25,384 --> 00:07:26,925
or indigenous sports and games.

100
00:07:28,045 --> 00:07:30,807
Can also include new activities like ninja, right,

101
00:07:30,847 --> 00:07:32,448
that are based on traditional practices.

102
00:07:33,668 --> 00:07:35,549
Okay, so more colloquially, I would say,

103
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:37,550
folk games are, they're simple games.

104
00:07:38,631 --> 00:07:40,952
So they're easy to understand for spectators,

105
00:07:40,972 --> 00:07:42,713
and they're easy to learn for the players.

106
00:07:45,367 --> 00:07:54,793
They usually don't, they don't often require equipment and if they do, it's common equipment like a ball or a deck of playing cards or a bat.

107
00:07:55,214 --> 00:07:59,196
So they're equipment that everyone has around that they could use to play the game.

108
00:08:00,317 --> 00:08:03,920
They're often spread by word of mouth and that's partly because they're so easy to teach.

109
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:08,263
And so they spread organically through groups of friends and through culture and so forth.

110
00:08:08,883 --> 00:08:11,345
And because of that, they're often house rules.

111
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:12,686
So each family...

112
00:08:13,148 --> 00:08:18,030
each playing community, each culture usually has different ways and slightly different

113
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:23,172
variations of these games. And in fact, that's why these games evolve organically over time

114
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:27,493
through different cultures. So for me, I want to focus on a specific type of folk game.

115
00:08:27,873 --> 00:08:32,455
I'm really interested in very physical games and deliberately really silly games. And so

116
00:08:32,495 --> 00:08:37,657
that's what I want to talk about today. So Eichberg makes this distinction between what

117
00:08:37,697 --> 00:08:42,458
he calls modern sport and popular sport. And folk games would be a type of popular sport.

118
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:48,371
So modern sport is kind of like professional sports that we see on TV or the Olympics or something

119
00:08:48,972 --> 00:08:53,533
where it's kind of about achieving perfection or setting some sort of record.

120
00:08:54,273 --> 00:09:01,915
Whereas he contrasts that with popular sport, which he sees as more festive, deliberately unserious,

121
00:09:02,295 --> 00:09:04,895
and there's this idea that anybody can get involved.

122
00:09:05,195 --> 00:09:10,577
So rather than professional sports, where there's a clear distinction between spectators and the people playing the game,

123
00:09:11,325 --> 00:09:13,586
in a folk game or a popular sport setting,

124
00:09:14,206 --> 00:09:15,747
everyone gets in and takes a turn.

125
00:09:16,607 --> 00:09:19,488
It's a lot messier, and the hope is that everyone

126
00:09:19,528 --> 00:09:20,288
will get involved.

127
00:09:20,468 --> 00:09:23,830
So to blur the boundary between player and spectator.

128
00:09:25,931 --> 00:09:29,432
And I think this dichotomy is obviously

129
00:09:29,452 --> 00:09:32,253
a little oversimplified, but what I like about it

130
00:09:32,373 --> 00:09:34,834
is it makes this nice distinction between

131
00:09:35,214 --> 00:09:37,075
the seriousness sometimes of sport

132
00:09:37,415 --> 00:09:38,876
and the unseriousness of.

133
00:09:39,576 --> 00:09:42,417
more popular sports, folk games, and carnival games and so forth.

134
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:46,538
And what we're getting at here is folk games isn't just a genre

135
00:09:47,338 --> 00:09:50,660
or like a formal quality of games, it's also an attitude.

136
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:54,201
It's how we approach the games, both as the players and the designers.

137
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:57,182
And so for me it's an attitude of unseriousness.

138
00:09:58,542 --> 00:10:02,743
Okay so now thinking again about that Dog the Wag game I was just showing.

139
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:06,111
uh... right this is a game that's deliberately supposed to be really

140
00:10:06,171 --> 00:10:07,632
stupid it's best to make the players

141
00:10:07,892 --> 00:10:10,673
look a little silly and enjoyable for the spectators

142
00:10:11,774 --> 00:10:13,614
and specifically i think what's going on here

143
00:10:13,935 --> 00:10:15,475
is this idea of subversion

144
00:10:16,036 --> 00:10:20,017
right so tying a move controller or really any video game controller to your butt

145
00:10:20,278 --> 00:10:21,498
is just like not what you

146
00:10:21,698 --> 00:10:23,899
typically do with game controllers

147
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,980
uh... it's not what they were really designed for

148
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:30,102
that's why these games to me are really fun

149
00:10:31,739 --> 00:10:36,602
kind of apart from the game itself, there's something fun about using this technology

150
00:10:36,942 --> 00:10:42,766
in deliberately stupid ways that you weren't meant to use them in that kind of way. So

151
00:10:42,786 --> 00:10:45,287
I do think there is a joy in subversion, so to speak.

152
00:10:46,308 --> 00:10:52,332
Okay, so I want to give some other examples of games I've made inspired by folk games.

153
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:57,836
So here's another installation I did recently, also with sound and music, by David. It's

154
00:10:57,896 --> 00:10:59,137
a game called Beacons of Hope.

155
00:11:00,257 --> 00:11:03,498
And so let me tell you the story behind the game before I tell you about the game.

156
00:11:04,258 --> 00:11:09,580
So I was sitting with my friend Tom and his wife this summer over beers,

157
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,900
and they were telling me about this summer camp game

158
00:11:12,101 --> 00:11:13,861
that they run for these kids at a summer camp.

159
00:11:14,381 --> 00:11:16,402
And they get a house out in the middle of the woods,

160
00:11:16,682 --> 00:11:18,722
and they turn off all the lights, and it's night.

161
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:20,383
The house is pitch black.

162
00:11:20,963 --> 00:11:24,564
And it's maybe like 30 people in the house running around this pitch black house.

163
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:29,135
Two players are monsters, so they're crawling around the ground, and they're trying to catch

164
00:11:29,436 --> 00:11:34,439
all the other players who are the humans, right? And the game is called Monsters. Now,

165
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,963
the monsters win if they can catch all the humans. The humans win, they're looking for

166
00:11:38,983 --> 00:11:43,747
a flashlight that has been hidden in the house by the moderator before the round. If they

167
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:48,190
can find the flashlight and shine it at the monsters, they win. And it's a simple game,

168
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:51,392
but the idea is, I don't know if you guys have ever tried this, but playing in the dark

169
00:11:51,472 --> 00:11:53,814
is actually just really fun in and of itself.

170
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,061
And so immediately again, when I heard this, I was like,

171
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:01,083
oh man, I know exactly what I want to do with this idea.

172
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:04,085
So I made this installation game.

173
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,786
It's played in an auditorium, maybe about this size.

174
00:12:07,647 --> 00:12:08,827
And there are about 20 players.

175
00:12:09,168 --> 00:12:12,049
Two players are monsters, like in the Monsters game.

176
00:12:12,469 --> 00:12:14,470
However, they carry around move controllers.

177
00:12:15,031 --> 00:12:18,413
And if they're still or slow, no light.

178
00:12:18,513 --> 00:12:20,994
So the room remains completely pitch black.

179
00:12:21,556 --> 00:12:26,959
However, if they ever move a little bit, say, to grab, reach out and grab one of the human

180
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:28,660
players, it lights up red quickly.

181
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,702
So suddenly out of the darkness, red light, and then it goes black again.

182
00:12:33,442 --> 00:12:38,185
Now the human players are looking for three move controllers, additional move controllers

183
00:12:38,205 --> 00:12:42,848
that have been hidden around the room, and they're these beacons of hope, these torches

184
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:43,668
that you're trying to find.

185
00:12:44,088 --> 00:12:47,690
So the humans, their goal is before time is up, before the ten minutes.

186
00:12:48,349 --> 00:12:52,051
they're trying to find all three of them and light them up at the same time, which

187
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:58,034
vanquishes the monsters. So again, a game that was directly inspired by this type of folk game,

188
00:12:58,655 --> 00:13:05,558
camp game, playground game. Again, finally, this game Johann Sebastian Joust, which is a little

189
00:13:05,578 --> 00:13:10,981
bit more maybe accessible than the other two games, it was also directly inspired by a number

190
00:13:11,021 --> 00:13:16,664
of folk games. One of them, which doesn't even have a name, Nils, Bernie, and I

191
00:13:17,655 --> 00:13:23,277
A few years ago, we were hanging out in Christiania, which is an area of Copenhagen, and we found

192
00:13:23,297 --> 00:13:26,958
this piece of playground equipment, and we just started messing around, and eventually

193
00:13:26,978 --> 00:13:32,360
we improvised a really simple game where you start, and you slowly walk towards each other

194
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:36,382
balancing on the rope, and you're trying to push each other off, and the first player

195
00:13:36,402 --> 00:13:37,462
to hit the ground loses.

196
00:13:37,762 --> 00:13:40,944
So even if you fall off, you want to fall off after the other person.

197
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:46,843
And, of course, it's even better if you can make it to the other side,

198
00:13:48,323 --> 00:13:51,364
and, without falling off and push the other guy.

199
00:13:51,404 --> 00:13:53,184
So here, Nils has made it to the other side,

200
00:13:53,244 --> 00:13:55,585
and I have to crawl under the rope in shame.

201
00:13:55,645 --> 00:13:56,365
I've just been roped.

202
00:13:58,586 --> 00:14:01,146
OK, here's another example.

203
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:02,406
I'm going to show you a quick video.

204
00:14:02,426 --> 00:14:06,027
And I'm actually going to switch over to DLC.

205
00:14:06,047 --> 00:14:06,087
OK.

206
00:14:07,127 --> 00:14:11,468
It's a game called Listerlanse, which means sneaky lance in Danish.

207
00:14:12,341 --> 00:14:14,542
And we each are blindfolded so we can't see.

208
00:14:14,982 --> 00:14:16,063
And we have a kitchen spoon.

209
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,704
This is a great party game, by the way, if you ever want to try this.

210
00:14:19,684 --> 00:14:20,664
Especially good if you're drunk.

211
00:14:20,845 --> 00:14:24,726
OK, so, we have to move in slow motion is the thing.

212
00:14:25,466 --> 00:14:29,488
And the first player to hit the other, see I just won there, the first player to hit

213
00:14:29,508 --> 00:14:30,388
the other wins.

214
00:14:31,189 --> 00:14:35,931
And it's the crowd around you watching is the thing that enforces that you're going

215
00:14:35,991 --> 00:14:36,511
slow enough.

216
00:14:37,631 --> 00:14:37,912
And so.

217
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:45,406
The basic insight with this game is that moving in slow motion feels super badass, but looks

218
00:14:45,486 --> 00:14:46,267
ridiculous.

219
00:14:46,367 --> 00:14:47,448
Like, you look like an idiot.

220
00:14:48,108 --> 00:14:52,571
So the spectators are having fun, you're having fun, and moving in slow motion, no matter

221
00:14:52,631 --> 00:14:55,113
what game you're playing, is fucking sweet.

222
00:14:55,453 --> 00:14:59,536
And that's really the core idea that inspired Joust, which is like, man, let's make a game

223
00:14:59,556 --> 00:15:01,418
where we just fucking move in slow motion.

224
00:15:01,998 --> 00:15:06,902
So again, pulled directly from a folk game.

225
00:15:07,727 --> 00:15:14,289
So I think a game like Joust, the rhetoric and the ideology around the game is very different

226
00:15:14,509 --> 00:15:19,751
than the type of rhetoric you hear in like AAA game marketing around all these new motion

227
00:15:19,771 --> 00:15:22,432
control devices like the Kinect, like the Wii, like the Move.

228
00:15:22,452 --> 00:15:26,073
So here's, I'm going to pick on the Move since I use it, it's a commercial.

229
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:30,695
I think this, you know, this takes the promise of this technology very seriously.

230
00:15:31,415 --> 00:15:35,756
It's very optimistic about the capabilities of these devices and, you know.

231
00:15:36,597 --> 00:15:39,800
promising these games that are really immersive where you really feel

232
00:15:42,162 --> 00:15:45,485
like you're in this fictional world doing these crazy things with this

233
00:15:45,525 --> 00:15:46,105
technology

234
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:52,050
but I think often the reality is that these technologies are super super

235
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:55,333
limited I don't know how much you guys have been able to play around with these

236
00:15:56,074 --> 00:15:58,396
gesture recognition or motion control technologies

237
00:15:59,076 --> 00:16:01,418
really a lot of technological limitations

238
00:16:02,239 --> 00:16:04,281
and despite all these promises and optimism

239
00:16:04,643 --> 00:16:07,924
like all these technologies just kind of suck, is the reality.

240
00:16:08,944 --> 00:16:11,265
And to me, that's awesome.

241
00:16:11,325 --> 00:16:13,585
Like, it's precisely because these technologies

242
00:16:13,725 --> 00:16:16,026
suck, which makes them really interesting and really fun.

243
00:16:16,186 --> 00:16:18,466
So I think part of the key here is

244
00:16:18,566 --> 00:16:21,027
to embrace these technological limitations,

245
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:22,627
rather than to try to fight them,

246
00:16:22,787 --> 00:16:28,088
to try to fight the latency problems of doing gesture

247
00:16:28,128 --> 00:16:30,769
recognition, and make complicated algorithms

248
00:16:31,129 --> 00:16:32,269
to deal with these problems.

249
00:16:32,794 --> 00:16:37,398
So, for example, a game like Joust, okay, so we have an accelerometer, right?

250
00:16:37,638 --> 00:16:38,959
What can an accelerometer do?

251
00:16:39,379 --> 00:16:41,281
Well, it can detect acceleration.

252
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:45,243
Okay, so let's just make a game about accelerating your controller,

253
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:48,146
or in this case, not accelerating your controller, right?

254
00:16:48,626 --> 00:16:52,269
And so that's, of course, the algorithm's slightly more complicated than that,

255
00:16:52,409 --> 00:16:56,952
but the idea here is, let's just do exactly what this technology does,

256
00:16:57,092 --> 00:16:58,313
so we don't really have to fight,

257
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:02,597
or pretend that this technology can do something more than what it's really doing.

258
00:17:03,915 --> 00:17:06,956
I think this is especially valuable insight if you're an indie, right?

259
00:17:06,996 --> 00:17:12,777
So if you're Ubisoft and you can throw like tons of money and tons of top talent

260
00:17:13,057 --> 00:17:15,978
into making complicated algorithms to get, for example,

261
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:21,020
four people working, or the Kinect tracking four people, which is kind of a miracle, right?

262
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,561
If you can't do that, you can't throw that type of money at it

263
00:17:25,621 --> 00:17:28,362
because you're just a solo indie or you're in a small studio.

264
00:17:28,382 --> 00:17:31,083
I think it's often more...

265
00:17:33,004 --> 00:17:37,389
effective and more productive to offload some of that work onto the players.

266
00:17:37,609 --> 00:17:41,292
So this is almost kind of like the lazy man's approach to doing motion control design.

267
00:17:41,312 --> 00:17:47,319
So there's no like camera in Joust that makes sure that you all stand in a circle or something

268
00:17:47,459 --> 00:17:50,822
or that you're not pushing each other or kicking each other or whatever, right?

269
00:17:51,022 --> 00:17:54,005
That's actually up to the players themselves to enforce those rules.

270
00:17:54,827 --> 00:17:59,690
The only thing that Joust uses is this kind of toy that detects whether it's moved too much or not.

271
00:18:00,431 --> 00:18:11,517
And, you know, this isn't that new. We've all been playing, we've all been enforcing rules when we play board games and sports and playground games for centuries, right?

272
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:22,243
So this is something we're used to. And so the design trick here becomes making the players think it's fun to improvise the rules, to enforce the rules, to add new rules.

273
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:27,903
and to sell them on this idea that, hey, we're not going to expect the computer to do everything

274
00:18:27,983 --> 00:18:34,087
for us, we're going to enjoy enforcing some of these rules as well. And so the term I

275
00:18:34,147 --> 00:18:39,812
refer to in my research is this idea of deputizing the player to modify the rules themselves.

276
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:45,536
And I think in a lot of my installation pieces and the types of motion control games I'm

277
00:18:45,576 --> 00:18:50,860
interested in, there's an aesthetic of imperfection here, so that these games are deliberately

278
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:51,360
messy.

279
00:18:52,084 --> 00:18:56,986
The technology is imperfect and really embracing that aesthetic.

280
00:18:58,047 --> 00:19:02,328
So this philosopher, Eichberg, I was talking before, has a really nice quote on this.

281
00:19:02,848 --> 00:19:04,169
He's writing about folk games here.

282
00:19:04,669 --> 00:19:04,989
He writes,

283
00:19:05,409 --> 00:19:09,051
The grotesque body displays what is imperfect in human form.

284
00:19:09,611 --> 00:19:13,052
The fool and the carnival are images of things going wrong in life.

285
00:19:13,593 --> 00:19:17,594
All this gives birth to laughter, which is thus linked to a deep recognition of human

286
00:19:17,654 --> 00:19:20,695
failure and blurs the edges between success and failure.

287
00:19:20,998 --> 00:19:24,139
that are sharpened by the modern culture of perfection.

288
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,841
And I think that really exactly summarizes

289
00:19:27,341 --> 00:19:29,202
this idea of laughter and imperfection,

290
00:19:29,442 --> 00:19:31,343
what I'm personally going for when I'm making

291
00:19:31,383 --> 00:19:32,384
these motion control games.

292
00:19:33,104 --> 00:19:35,545
And so the idea here is that, to me, motion control

293
00:19:35,865 --> 00:19:38,347
is the slapstick comedy of computer games.

294
00:19:39,627 --> 00:19:41,988
And yeah, here's some people playing one of our Wiimote

295
00:19:42,008 --> 00:19:46,331
games at our Kill Screen GDC party last year.

296
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:49,252
And right, the idea is playing the fool.

297
00:19:49,592 --> 00:19:50,693
So these games are.

298
00:19:51,329 --> 00:19:56,712
an excuse, just an alibi for the players to make themselves look like assholes and for

299
00:19:56,792 --> 00:20:00,394
everyone in the room to enjoy a laugh at the player's expense, right?

300
00:20:01,735 --> 00:20:06,758
Now a game like Dog the Wag or Beacons of Hope is a pretty niche installation game.

301
00:20:06,778 --> 00:20:08,199
It's a little intense, right?

302
00:20:08,719 --> 00:20:14,543
So a more accessible game like Joust still has elements of this playing the fool, right?

303
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:19,442
Joust looks deliberately silly, you're kind of waltzing around in slow motion.

304
00:20:19,642 --> 00:20:23,845
So the way joust works is you have a move controller in your hand,

305
00:20:24,465 --> 00:20:27,487
and if you ever move it too much, you're out,

306
00:20:27,587 --> 00:20:30,569
and you want to be the last player remaining.

307
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:33,431
Now, of course, your opponents are going to try to hit your hand,

308
00:20:33,531 --> 00:20:35,653
or hit your controller to make you out.

309
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:37,874
So you're all slowly revolving around each other,

310
00:20:37,954 --> 00:20:40,336
trying to defend your controller from the other players,

311
00:20:40,536 --> 00:20:42,538
and also trying to hit them to make them out.

312
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:42,698
And so...

313
00:20:44,615 --> 00:20:49,117
Joust is a little bit more sport-like than some of the other installations I was talking about,

314
00:20:49,238 --> 00:20:54,240
but it has that nice element of looking ridiculous, acting theatrically.

315
00:20:54,440 --> 00:21:00,023
And I think in Joust, it's that nice mix between competitive sport and playing the fool

316
00:21:00,303 --> 00:21:04,405
that gives it this nice feeling, this nice compromise between the two.

317
00:21:06,185 --> 00:21:09,807
And I think this idea of playing the fool has actually already been used really successfully

318
00:21:09,847 --> 00:21:11,008
in a number of commercial games.

319
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:15,573
So here's my absolute favorite Wii game, WarioWare Smooth Moves.

320
00:21:16,313 --> 00:21:21,537
And this is a game that tells you to put the Wiimote in all sorts of crazy positions, like

321
00:21:21,597 --> 00:21:24,859
do the Mohawk pose, do the elephant pose.

322
00:21:25,539 --> 00:21:30,002
And the key is there's a bunch of micro games, so these like five second games, and you just

323
00:21:30,062 --> 00:21:31,143
play a bunch of them in a row.

324
00:21:33,256 --> 00:21:37,779
In a way, that's genius because even if the game can't detect your input correctly,

325
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:42,922
it doesn't even matter because the game is over in five seconds and you have no idea what the hell just happened.

326
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:48,205
And so the point of that game isn't to like really win or play well with your controller,

327
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:52,787
it's to look like an asshole, like with this controller on your head and to give everyone a laugh.

328
00:21:53,147 --> 00:21:55,309
So I think this is a really perfect example of that.

329
00:21:55,349 --> 00:21:59,431
And to me it's not surprising that this is the best game on the Nintendo Wii, right?

330
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:05,352
A more recent example of this that I love is a new game for the Vita called Frobisher

331
00:22:05,392 --> 00:22:05,653
Says.

332
00:22:05,673 --> 00:22:10,455
It's by Richard Hogg and a small studio in England called Honey Slug.

333
00:22:11,195 --> 00:22:16,478
And this game, like WarioWare, uses a bunch of micro games and it tries to use all the

334
00:22:16,498 --> 00:22:18,799
different capabilities of the Vita controller.

335
00:22:18,819 --> 00:22:22,921
The camera, the buttons, the two screens, and so forth and so on.

336
00:22:23,882 --> 00:22:25,022
Here's a picture of some people playing it.

337
00:22:25,524 --> 00:22:28,786
My favorite example is a micro game called Look Away.

338
00:22:28,967 --> 00:22:31,989
And so the Vita tells you to look away,

339
00:22:32,229 --> 00:22:34,692
and you have to look away while you're playing this.

340
00:22:35,212 --> 00:22:38,515
And if the camera ever detects the whites of your eyeballs,

341
00:22:38,555 --> 00:22:39,196
you lose.

342
00:22:39,356 --> 00:22:41,417
So you really do have to look away.

343
00:22:41,437 --> 00:22:43,299
And of course, the game is trying

344
00:22:43,339 --> 00:22:45,021
to tempt you into looking at it with all sorts

345
00:22:45,061 --> 00:22:47,182
of ridiculous subliminal images that it's showing.

346
00:22:47,463 --> 00:22:50,025
And so again, that's a really nice comedic example

347
00:22:50,505 --> 00:22:51,827
of using this.

348
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:57,982
Vita technology, I'm sure in a way that the people who invented it never thought of anyone

349
00:22:58,102 --> 00:23:03,563
using it, right? And of course, another really great example is an iPad game called Fingal.

350
00:23:03,623 --> 00:23:08,445
It's like Twister for your fingers, and that's also an IGF finalist this year that I'm sure

351
00:23:08,465 --> 00:23:13,106
you'll be able to try on the show floor. Again, deliberately really silly, physical, simple,

352
00:23:14,106 --> 00:23:22,109
and humorous. It's a nice example. So speaking of iOS, I think smartphones and smartphone

353
00:23:22,149 --> 00:23:23,149
technology in general.

354
00:23:23,886 --> 00:23:26,827
is a really promising platform for this type of stuff, right?

355
00:23:26,867 --> 00:23:30,289
We're all walking around, well not all of us, but many of us are walking around

356
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:34,851
every day with accelerometers and music playing devices in our pockets.

357
00:23:35,412 --> 00:23:38,033
And so it'd be really easy to bust out one of these games

358
00:23:38,673 --> 00:23:41,775
at a party, in the park, at a family reunion.

359
00:23:42,575 --> 00:23:45,297
So me and the chums at Degouta Fabrique

360
00:23:46,157 --> 00:23:49,559
want to start, we plan to start making a series of

361
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:52,700
joust-like physical games for smartphones.

362
00:23:53,294 --> 00:23:55,475
that we're tentatively calling Spielplatz,

363
00:23:56,135 --> 00:23:57,955
which means playground in German.

364
00:23:58,595 --> 00:24:01,276
And so then, yeah, here's a kind of a fun illustration

365
00:24:01,316 --> 00:24:03,757
of us playing these types of games with smartphones.

366
00:24:04,337 --> 00:24:06,978
And again, yeah, I think these technologies

367
00:24:07,018 --> 00:24:08,458
are becoming more and more prevalent.

368
00:24:08,838 --> 00:24:11,019
And so I think... I do think you're gonna start to see

369
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:12,919
more of these types of physical games

370
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:15,180
using these technologies, which is really exciting.

371
00:24:16,148 --> 00:24:19,211
However, the note I want to end this on is, to be really clear,

372
00:24:19,631 --> 00:24:23,835
the idea here is not to use technology to improve games.

373
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:25,796
I think you often hear a lot of rhetoric about,

374
00:24:26,297 --> 00:24:27,938
we're augmenting the living room,

375
00:24:28,018 --> 00:24:31,541
and we're enriching traditional play with the beauty

376
00:24:31,561 --> 00:24:32,682
of technology or something.

377
00:24:34,063 --> 00:24:37,406
And to me, that rhetoric is a little too optimistic.

378
00:24:37,927 --> 00:24:40,109
And it's also a little insulting, right?

379
00:24:40,169 --> 00:24:41,170
Like, a game like Ninja?

380
00:24:41,908 --> 00:24:45,790
is like, actually pretty perfect the way it is. It doesn't need any fucking technology

381
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:51,251
to make it any better, right? So what exactly, like, what is the point of these, these things?

382
00:24:51,312 --> 00:24:55,653
Why would, why would we add technology? So I want to, like, flip the script a little

383
00:24:55,693 --> 00:25:00,675
bit. So I'm not interested in how technology can improve games. I'm interested in how games

384
00:25:00,715 --> 00:25:05,796
can improve technology, right? So I actually kind of fucking loathe this stupid little

385
00:25:05,856 --> 00:25:10,478
smartphone that I walk around with in my pocket every day. Like, this is, I hate this thing.

386
00:25:11,383 --> 00:25:17,508
And so I would love to repurpose this thing to ends more personal and more silly and more

387
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:21,751
playful that makes this thing speak to my life, right?

388
00:25:23,132 --> 00:25:27,415
And I think these types of physical games are one way of doing that.

389
00:25:27,655 --> 00:25:29,276
Of course, I'm being a little glib, right?

390
00:25:29,356 --> 00:25:34,700
But, you know, I do think it is important to repurpose these things and, you know, give

391
00:25:34,761 --> 00:25:38,163
us a reason to use these things in creative ways.

392
00:25:40,185 --> 00:25:41,566
Yeah, that's basically it.

393
00:25:41,846 --> 00:25:42,667
You can go to my website.

394
00:25:42,687 --> 00:25:44,548
There's some of my research papers.

395
00:25:44,608 --> 00:25:47,190
I'm going to post my dissertation on the website

396
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:48,911
soon, where I talk about some of these ideas

397
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:50,011
and some of these games.

398
00:25:50,271 --> 00:25:53,573
And yeah, you can reach us by email or come talk to me

399
00:25:53,754 --> 00:25:54,654
or whatever.

400
00:25:54,874 --> 00:25:55,535
And that's it.

401
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:55,895
Thank you.

402
00:25:55,975 --> 00:25:56,335
Thank you.

403
00:25:56,355 --> 00:26:02,919
Oh, really?

404
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:03,539
Yeah.

405
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:04,180
OK.

406
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,421
Yeah, apparently we have time for questions.

407
00:26:07,222 --> 00:26:08,122
If we don't use the microphone.

408
00:26:08,991 --> 00:26:10,711
Okay, and I'm supposed to repeat the question

409
00:26:11,352 --> 00:26:12,392
if they don't use the microphone.

410
00:26:12,992 --> 00:26:14,373
So I guess I could take questions.

411
00:26:18,974 --> 00:26:19,594
No questions.

412
00:26:21,775 --> 00:26:22,475
Or is there a question?

413
00:26:26,236 --> 00:26:26,576
Say what?

414
00:26:29,037 --> 00:26:30,397
Microphones in the aisles. Yeah.

415
00:26:30,417 --> 00:26:33,638
man 3 So could you ever have a full game with one player,

416
00:26:33,938 --> 00:26:36,799
or does the definition have to include community?

417
00:26:38,464 --> 00:27:06,313
Yeah, I think you can. So I think Solitaire would be an example of, right, like it uses common equipment. It's kind of organically evolved over the years. It's simple. I guess when I personally, the types of folk games I'm interested in are multiplayer and physical. But I guess if we, if we take the broad example of folk games, yeah, I think Solitaire would be a great example. Andres, you've got to use the microphone.

418
00:27:07,651 --> 00:27:11,553
How often do you guys end up breaking shit from all the different games you play?

419
00:27:11,833 --> 00:27:14,375
So I'm gonna I'm gonna sound like an advertisement for Sony

420
00:27:15,235 --> 00:27:18,537
but like goddamn the engineers who made these controllers are

421
00:27:19,317 --> 00:27:25,881
Like kudos to them. I these all my controllers have been dropped like over a hundred times and they're still working pretty well

422
00:27:26,581 --> 00:27:27,842
even with button we had

423
00:27:29,923 --> 00:27:35,906
You know with these Xbox controllers people wrestling over them they held up pretty well, so yeah, I think these things are

424
00:27:36,827 --> 00:27:38,428
we thought we would be breaking tons of them.

425
00:27:38,609 --> 00:27:40,550
But, yeah, kudos to controller engineers.

426
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:42,551
Thank you out there wherever you are.

427
00:27:44,473 --> 00:27:47,395
So with the advent of Facebook and social media

428
00:27:47,455 --> 00:27:49,796
sort of breaking down and dictating

429
00:27:49,836 --> 00:27:51,057
how we interact with each other,

430
00:27:51,077 --> 00:27:52,658
we're getting further and further away

431
00:27:52,718 --> 00:27:54,079
from physical interaction.

432
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:58,102
How would you best want to reintroduce

433
00:27:58,962 --> 00:28:00,463
physically interacting with each other

434
00:28:00,544 --> 00:28:02,865
in a game modality using these mediums?

435
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:03,986
Using Facebook?

436
00:28:04,409 --> 00:28:07,291
Not necessarily Facebook, but the opening that Facebook presents.

437
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:12,014
I'm not even on Facebook, so like, uh, uh, uh, uh, shoot, I don't know.

438
00:28:12,034 --> 00:28:16,998
Um, I will say though, that's like, for me, that introducing physicality back is like a big deal.

439
00:28:17,058 --> 00:28:21,461
So, and joust, one of the nice things, it gives adults an excuse to be able to touch each other.

440
00:28:21,481 --> 00:28:22,082
Right?

441
00:28:22,322 --> 00:28:25,104
Uh, and actually, it's, you know, that's pretty cool.

442
00:28:25,164 --> 00:28:26,906
That's just not something we get to do every day.

443
00:28:27,046 --> 00:28:28,507
So that's, that's certainly a goal.

444
00:28:28,747 --> 00:28:30,708
Um, how we do that with like Twitter or Facebook.

445
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:32,370
I have no idea.

446
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:34,471
But I would love to see someone do it.

447
00:28:34,591 --> 00:28:35,611
Yeah, I don't know.

448
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:37,252
Am I misunderstanding the question or...?

449
00:28:39,473 --> 00:28:42,514
Too long of a rant for a one-question thing, so...

450
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:42,914
Okay, okay.

451
00:28:42,934 --> 00:28:43,354
You're fine.

452
00:28:44,315 --> 00:28:44,695
And one more.

453
00:28:44,715 --> 00:28:46,076
Andreas.

454
00:28:46,576 --> 00:28:49,277
Do you see any risk not getting improved

455
00:28:49,317 --> 00:28:51,938
if you make a game for iPhone, for example?

456
00:28:52,178 --> 00:28:52,758
Yeah, so...

457
00:28:53,138 --> 00:28:54,299
Do you have to have...

458
00:28:54,579 --> 00:28:56,880
The reason I said Joust-like games, not Joust,

459
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:57,780
is, like...

460
00:28:58,631 --> 00:29:01,012
iOS, we've been thinking about this a lot.

461
00:29:01,672 --> 00:29:04,473
Or smartphones in general require a different type of games.

462
00:29:05,054 --> 00:29:10,256
I think there are less physical, but less aggressive games

463
00:29:10,296 --> 00:29:11,296
that make a lot of sense.

464
00:29:11,456 --> 00:29:13,877
And we have a bunch of ideas for smartphones.

465
00:29:13,897 --> 00:29:17,498
I also thought about that you need, if it's a multiplayer game,

466
00:29:17,578 --> 00:29:20,260
you can't really do anything with it if you only buy one copy.

467
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,960
Yeah, but that's not true, right?

468
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,961
You can imagine a lot of folk games that just use one device

469
00:29:25,181 --> 00:29:26,842
that you're passing around with a bunch of people.

470
00:29:27,117 --> 00:29:31,898
And that's what I mean, like, I think those games are going to look different for the

471
00:29:32,258 --> 00:29:35,419
smartphone technology than they are going to for the Move, right? But they're out there.

472
00:29:35,659 --> 00:29:40,479
And Fingal is living proof of a really good, you know, I wouldn't call them folk games,

473
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:47,141
but a folk-ish type game that only uses one device that iOS did approve that's really

474
00:29:47,201 --> 00:29:51,541
cool, right? So, I mean, these games are out there. I just think the Move games are going

475
00:29:51,561 --> 00:29:53,442
to look a little different than the smartphone games.

476
00:29:57,089 --> 00:29:57,358
Thank you.
