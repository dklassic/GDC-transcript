1
00:00:02,768 --> 00:00:09,856
everybody. Good morning. Jeez. I've not had coffee yet so it's good to see that you have. My

2
00:00:09,896 --> 00:00:16,182
name is Mark Barrett. I am currently independent about two weeks ago. I'm formerly from

3
00:00:16,222 --> 00:00:20,206
PopCap and this talk is a hitchhiker's guide to rapid prototype.

4
00:00:21,927 --> 00:00:28,172
It is designed for those of us with limited money, opportunity or skill set who want to

5
00:00:28,212 --> 00:00:28,912
make games anyway.

6
00:00:30,093 --> 00:00:33,775
A little bit of a heads up, we have a lot of ground to cover and only a little bit of

7
00:00:33,816 --> 00:00:34,076
time.

8
00:00:34,156 --> 00:00:35,657
So we're going to go pretty fast.

9
00:00:37,218 --> 00:00:39,379
As soon as I figure out the button to push.

10
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:40,580
So I got my timer.

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,501
All right.

12
00:00:42,521 --> 00:00:42,882
Let's do it.

13
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:45,083
Overview.

14
00:00:47,725 --> 00:00:55,210
about me. We're going to define a rapid prototype, talk about setting a goal, vision, process

15
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:59,392
and conclusion. Seems easy enough. About me.

16
00:01:00,923 --> 00:01:08,384
Chapter 1. My road to games is almost a perfectly straight, boring line. I grew up in

17
00:01:08,424 --> 00:01:14,765
Wyoming. I was surrounded by snow. I played a lot of RPGs. I pretended to make games in

18
00:01:14,805 --> 00:01:19,106
Mario Paint. At some point I read a magazine that there was a school where you could

19
00:01:19,126 --> 00:01:24,107
learn to make games. So I headed out to Seattle. I went to DigiPen Institute of

20
00:01:24,127 --> 00:01:28,588
Technology and graduated with a Bachelor's in Fine Arts and Animation.

21
00:01:29,508 --> 00:01:36,074
a fine arts and production animation. They like long titles there. And you pay for it. I have

22
00:01:36,114 --> 00:01:41,439
worked at places like these. I've been in the game industry for a little over ten years now.

23
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:48,406
And I have worked on games like these. And today we're going to talk about, well not any of

24
00:01:48,446 --> 00:01:48,966
that actually.

25
00:01:51,133 --> 00:01:57,436
We're going to talk about game jams. A game jam, for any of you unfamiliar, I doubt there is

26
00:01:57,456 --> 00:02:02,378
anybody but just in case, it's when a bunch of people get together and plan and design and

27
00:02:02,418 --> 00:02:07,360
create a game in a short span of time. Typically anywhere from 24 hours to a week.

28
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:13,973
And my very first game jam was at PopCap back in 2010.

29
00:02:14,573 --> 00:02:17,515
And on that one, everyone was given a randomly generated

30
00:02:17,575 --> 00:02:17,875
theme.

31
00:02:18,476 --> 00:02:21,317
And our team got unpleasant horse racing in the sky.

32
00:02:21,938 --> 00:02:24,699
And this is how I thought that might look initially.

33
00:02:26,415 --> 00:02:35,798
and this is what it turned into, a cutely violent game about jumping on horses and pushing

34
00:02:35,818 --> 00:02:44,081
them into grinders. And this is the crazy part, though, is somehow that won best of

35
00:02:44,181 --> 00:02:49,783
show and PopCap actually released that game for a little bit of time.

36
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:56,909
That experience to me was just like the speed, it was a 24â€‘hour game jam and the speed

37
00:02:57,249 --> 00:03:00,292
and just working with people I had never worked with before and getting a chance to do everything

38
00:03:00,692 --> 00:03:07,658
got me hyped up. And I started going game jam crazy. I started making as many prototypes

39
00:03:07,698 --> 00:03:13,243
as I possibly could. These are a few. I'm going to show you this one. It's called Cat

40
00:03:13,283 --> 00:03:13,503
Butt.

41
00:03:15,825 --> 00:03:22,249
The point and the fun of this game is in trying to get other people to play it. You dig around

42
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:31,195
in a cat's butt looking for treasure. It was not successful. And then this is a totally

43
00:03:31,235 --> 00:03:36,058
different take on a game. This one is called Boy or Girl and it's a game about the limits

44
00:03:36,138 --> 00:03:42,602
of binary labels. So you have 60 seconds to look through random images and you can choose

45
00:03:42,642 --> 00:03:43,143
to label them.

46
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:48,870
the labels that you're given are boy or girl. And at the end, you get to see how many images

47
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:54,274
you labeled. And that's the whole game. And to get through all the images, you have to

48
00:03:54,374 --> 00:03:59,357
really race. You have to go quick if you want to get through all of them. But if you pause

49
00:03:59,417 --> 00:04:05,102
on any image for even two seconds, the labels will start to fade. And once they're gone,

50
00:04:05,302 --> 00:04:08,884
you automatically progress to the next image. And you can play the whole game this way.

51
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:14,974
just simply accepting things as they are. And these prototypes and a lot more that I can't

52
00:04:15,014 --> 00:04:20,778
show you, led to me having an opportunity to work in the former R&D department of PopCap

53
00:04:20,818 --> 00:04:24,862
called PopLabs. And when I was there, it was a great opportunity to work with the

54
00:04:25,002 --> 00:04:32,307
changed the way I viewed careers in the industry. I thought there are a bunch of ladders, we

55
00:04:32,367 --> 00:04:38,292
all choose one, we start at the bottom, we climb to the top and the optimal strategy is to

56
00:04:38,352 --> 00:04:42,895
just stay in your lane and be the best you can because to a large degree that's how our

57
00:04:42,955 --> 00:04:43,836
industry values us.

58
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:49,623
But through prototype, I discovered the intricate

59
00:04:49,643 --> 00:04:52,005
and exciting ways that all these different disciplines

60
00:04:52,085 --> 00:04:52,746
weave together.

61
00:04:52,766 --> 00:04:55,308
And it let me be more than an artist,

62
00:04:55,668 --> 00:04:58,230
and more than a designer.

63
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,193
It let me be a diverse and resourceful person.

64
00:05:01,633 --> 00:05:05,997
And to me, that is just as crucial as intense focus

65
00:05:06,057 --> 00:05:07,118
or incredible technique.

66
00:05:07,658 --> 00:05:08,879
So today I'm gonna share some of the stuff

67
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:12,622
that I've personally found to be effective to get started.

68
00:05:12,762 --> 00:05:18,643
prototyping and avoid some of the very, very common pitfalls. My hope is to encourage all of

69
00:05:18,763 --> 00:05:24,164
us as individuals and as an industry to start thinking of prototyping as a form of cross

70
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:33,706
training. The benefits are hard to judge and slow to gain at first, but with each experience I

71
00:05:33,746 --> 00:05:38,787
think it compounds in a way that can improve the satisfaction, productivity and overall

72
00:05:38,827 --> 00:05:39,887
performance of anybody.

73
00:05:41,976 --> 00:05:44,259
So with that, what is a rapid prototype?

74
00:05:46,382 --> 00:05:48,385
I think we can all agree it's something we'll do quickly.

75
00:05:48,405 --> 00:05:50,988
It's a rough draft, maybe even a first version.

76
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,752
Usually just an experiment,

77
00:05:53,852 --> 00:05:56,216
and I think that's a general view.

78
00:05:57,849 --> 00:05:58,810
Let's go a step deeper.

79
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,431
You've probably heard of this.

80
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:03,013
It comes from the book The Lean Startup by Eric Ries.

81
00:06:03,453 --> 00:06:06,475
He refers to a prototype as a minimum viable product.

82
00:06:07,076 --> 00:06:09,077
And the idea is to do as little as possible

83
00:06:09,258 --> 00:06:10,959
to get that product up and working.

84
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:15,602
And that sounds good, but what I found is

85
00:06:15,702 --> 00:06:18,604
if you approach a minimum viable product literally,

86
00:06:18,624 --> 00:06:21,046
then you risk focusing too much

87
00:06:21,707 --> 00:06:22,627
on what you're trying to make

88
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,509
and not enough on the reason you're making it.

89
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:33,257
So take a look at this. Both of these are valid ways to build, measure and learn about a

90
00:06:33,297 --> 00:06:39,259
prototype. And look, they both end up positive. And you have all at some point, I'm sure in

91
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:44,621
this GDC, heard the mantra fail fast. Well, I can tell you from experience, if you go about

92
00:06:44,661 --> 00:06:49,803
it the way they did in the top one, where the end justifies the means and your focus is only

93
00:06:49,863 --> 00:06:53,884
on building a good product in the end, then I think you'll get shut down long before you

94
00:06:53,904 --> 00:06:54,504
reach step four.

95
00:06:55,685 --> 00:06:59,588
On the bottom though, the focus is always on the interaction.

96
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:02,811
Every step trying to produce a needed behavior.

97
00:07:03,511 --> 00:07:06,454
And I found this to be a really, really helpful distinction.

98
00:07:08,781 --> 00:07:15,162
So that's the one that I personally use, minimum viable interaction. And I feel like I should

99
00:07:15,202 --> 00:07:21,383
say this, all of what I mention prototyping is going to be in the context of games and all of

100
00:07:21,463 --> 00:07:27,865
this is opinion from my experience that I give to you as information. I hope you will find

101
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:33,106
your own point of view and I hope you will give a talk on it and I will go and learn new

102
00:07:33,146 --> 00:07:33,586
stuff from you.

103
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,360
Setting a goal.

104
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,843
Setting a goal is an outcome you desire

105
00:07:39,863 --> 00:07:41,384
that motivates you to action.

106
00:07:42,104 --> 00:07:45,747
A goal without action is not a goal, it's a wish.

107
00:07:47,288 --> 00:07:49,189
Seems simple, but not really.

108
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:53,012
To achieve a goal, we all know we must act,

109
00:07:53,532 --> 00:07:55,534
but how must we act?

110
00:07:56,694 --> 00:07:57,495
That depends on your goal.

111
00:07:58,195 --> 00:07:59,476
If your goal is to be poor,

112
00:07:59,877 --> 00:08:01,218
throwing groupies into a pond

113
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,159
is exactly the right action you should take.

114
00:08:04,755 --> 00:08:07,136
If your goal is to defeat the forces of evil

115
00:08:07,256 --> 00:08:08,777
and restore balance to the land,

116
00:08:08,857 --> 00:08:11,838
then throwing your money in the water is a curious decision.

117
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,260
Whenever I'm deciding how to act on a goal,

118
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,881
I always start by asking this question.

119
00:08:19,662 --> 00:08:22,283
Is this urgent or important?

120
00:08:25,234 --> 00:08:28,316
Urgent is what you are currently trying to accomplish.

121
00:08:28,737 --> 00:08:31,679
And these choices can range from totally mindless

122
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:33,220
to very stressful.

123
00:08:34,341 --> 00:08:37,183
Link here is pondering, should I smash this pot

124
00:08:37,363 --> 00:08:38,364
or grab that rupee?

125
00:08:39,284 --> 00:08:40,685
That is an urgent decision.

126
00:08:42,367 --> 00:08:45,229
Important goals are more like a destination

127
00:08:45,249 --> 00:08:45,909
that you're headed.

128
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,731
They're the long-term manifestation

129
00:08:49,212 --> 00:08:51,573
of something deep inside, your core values.

130
00:08:52,967 --> 00:08:54,628
Link hoists the sword and says,

131
00:08:54,749 --> 00:08:56,670
I will wield this master sword,

132
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:59,052
and with it smite all who oppose me.

133
00:08:59,852 --> 00:09:01,714
Uncle, you shall be avenged.

134
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:06,878
If you have an important goal, then you have a direction.

135
00:09:06,898 --> 00:09:10,941
And that direction will tell you how to act and what to do.

136
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:18,252
And the only thing stopping you is all the other goals that you want or need to do. And this is a

137
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:22,433
very typical phenomenon. It's called putting out the big fire. It happens on a daily basis.

138
00:09:23,054 --> 00:09:27,795
And instinctually, without thinking, we are programmed to put out big fires because big

139
00:09:27,855 --> 00:09:37,099
fires are very dangerous. But fires used properly are also an amazing tool. If you can

140
00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:37,619
control them.

141
00:09:38,617 --> 00:09:40,218
So when I find myself working on a goal

142
00:09:40,299 --> 00:09:41,940
that usually I don't remember setting,

143
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,301
chances are I'm focused on something urgent.

144
00:09:44,662 --> 00:09:47,544
And if the goal is urgent, I resist,

145
00:09:48,985 --> 00:09:52,448
I resist my immediate impulse to stamp it out.

146
00:09:53,788 --> 00:09:55,710
I don't react to it, I try to control it.

147
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:58,772
And the way you do that is looking at it creatively,

148
00:09:59,233 --> 00:10:00,594
trying to see what can be done

149
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:02,515
to nudge it in the right direction.

150
00:10:02,915 --> 00:10:06,098
How can you turn this chaos into something of value?

151
00:10:08,601 --> 00:10:12,304
and doing this will help you build up your momentum and your focus which will have a

152
00:10:12,344 --> 00:10:18,230
dramatic impact on what you're able to achieve and how quickly you can achieve it. So for

153
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:23,775
the first place you want to start is that clear direction, your important goal. And a great

154
00:10:23,795 --> 00:10:29,721
tool I found to get my longâ€‘term goals nice and clear is the smart checklist which I have

155
00:10:30,758 --> 00:10:32,659
Illustrated for you here in rainbow color

156
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:34,219
because it's so exciting.

157
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,600
Smart goals are specific,

158
00:10:36,921 --> 00:10:38,501
precisely what is to be accomplished.

159
00:10:39,121 --> 00:10:40,522
They are measurable.

160
00:10:40,842 --> 00:10:42,823
How will progress be visible and tracked?

161
00:10:44,604 --> 00:10:45,184
Attainable.

162
00:10:45,324 --> 00:10:46,925
What actions are needed to make it happen?

163
00:10:49,466 --> 00:10:49,866
Relevant.

164
00:10:50,046 --> 00:10:51,807
How is your goal meaningful and realistic?

165
00:10:53,171 --> 00:10:59,956
and time bound. What is the estimated time for completion? You use this and you write your

166
00:10:59,996 --> 00:11:08,882
goal one line at a time. So let's say I'm making a goal, a smart goal for prototyping. Boom. I

167
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:14,826
will create a rapid prototype for a game that users will be able to test and offer feedback by

168
00:11:14,866 --> 00:11:21,011
signing up for and participating in a game jam. This would make me a more resourceful dev and

169
00:11:21,031 --> 00:11:22,552
will be completed in one month's time.

170
00:11:26,488 --> 00:11:29,270
Goals are the motivational foundation

171
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,550
that lead to your choices,

172
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,491
and your choices lead to your actions,

173
00:11:32,611 --> 00:11:34,392
and your actions lead to your outcomes.

174
00:11:34,892 --> 00:11:37,593
So I urge you, take the time in the beginning

175
00:11:38,914 --> 00:11:40,714
and the care to make your goals specific.

176
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,375
Write them down, make them visible,

177
00:11:43,256 --> 00:11:44,676
so that when the urgent comes along,

178
00:11:44,876 --> 00:11:45,577
you'll know what to do

179
00:11:47,837 --> 00:11:51,139
to get your MBG, your most valuable goal.

180
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:54,320
All right, strategy.

181
00:11:57,205 --> 00:11:58,226
who thought I was going to do chess.

182
00:11:58,286 --> 00:11:59,947
I didn't, I went football scrum board.

183
00:12:01,648 --> 00:12:04,611
A strategy is a plan of action carefully designed

184
00:12:04,631 --> 00:12:05,751
to enable us to achieve our goal.

185
00:12:06,932 --> 00:12:10,475
It accounts for, well a good strategy will identify

186
00:12:10,675 --> 00:12:12,076
all the targets you want to hit.

187
00:12:12,096 --> 00:12:15,318
The deliverables, features, functions, tasks,

188
00:12:15,859 --> 00:12:17,159
deadlines and costs involved.

189
00:12:19,629 --> 00:12:23,073
And then you narrow those down into something called scope.

190
00:12:23,773 --> 00:12:27,157
Scope is the focus that you can hit.

191
00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:30,621
And scope is a delicate process.

192
00:12:32,563 --> 00:12:34,685
Any attempt to rush or phone it in,

193
00:12:35,085 --> 00:12:37,068
and your project will likely die a grisly death

194
00:12:37,128 --> 00:12:38,589
or spend the rest of its development

195
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,411
trying to outrun the consequences.

196
00:12:41,556 --> 00:12:46,681
And bad scope is at the heart of so many failures that I feel like I need to just talk a little

197
00:12:46,741 --> 00:12:51,807
bit about how that happens because it sneaks up on you. Bad scope is almost never something

198
00:12:51,827 --> 00:12:57,873
you do on purpose. Usually it's the result of your big loud ego being its totally normal

199
00:12:57,933 --> 00:12:58,614
and healthy self.

200
00:13:01,292 --> 00:13:03,614
Ego, though, is a very blunt instrument

201
00:13:03,654 --> 00:13:05,576
that has a way of disregarding anything

202
00:13:05,596 --> 00:13:06,917
it does not want to consider.

203
00:13:07,758 --> 00:13:11,141
In particular, it has a blind spot for any barriers

204
00:13:12,142 --> 00:13:14,243
outside our bright, shiny goals.

205
00:13:15,284 --> 00:13:17,146
And this is a problem because those barriers

206
00:13:17,646 --> 00:13:19,848
absolutely have an impact on whether or not

207
00:13:19,868 --> 00:13:20,609
you're gonna achieve them.

208
00:13:21,189 --> 00:13:24,492
And if you're unable to recognize or acknowledge them,

209
00:13:24,612 --> 00:13:25,733
then you're gonna have bad scope.

210
00:13:26,781 --> 00:13:30,604
So your ego is just simply not equipped to handle barriers.

211
00:13:31,064 --> 00:13:31,845
It's too fragile.

212
00:13:32,525 --> 00:13:33,246
But you know who is?

213
00:13:34,467 --> 00:13:34,987
Humility.

214
00:13:36,128 --> 00:13:38,049
Humility is quiet and sensitive.

215
00:13:38,069 --> 00:13:39,911
We don't listen to it near enough.

216
00:13:40,752 --> 00:13:43,073
But humility can feel out your internal barriers,

217
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:44,694
things like attitude, emotions,

218
00:13:45,155 --> 00:13:47,417
understanding, creativity, skill.

219
00:13:49,658 --> 00:13:52,140
And humility will spot external barriers,

220
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:56,083
things like time, resources, location, opportunity.

221
00:13:57,308 --> 00:13:57,969
competition.

222
00:14:01,052 --> 00:14:03,515
And the thing that humility realizes

223
00:14:03,735 --> 00:14:05,257
is that acknowledging your barriers

224
00:14:05,718 --> 00:14:09,162
isn't gonna keep you from working at places like these,

225
00:14:09,803 --> 00:14:13,247
it's gonna keep you from trying to match

226
00:14:13,267 --> 00:14:15,990
the level of production at places like these.

227
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,062
So I chose all these images for actually a very specific

228
00:14:20,122 --> 00:14:24,185
reason, they are from a short film called Rejected

229
00:14:24,245 --> 00:14:26,267
by Don Herzfeld, if you haven't seen it, look it up.

230
00:14:27,628 --> 00:14:29,850
In the film he has one goal, it's to make commercials

231
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,712
for different companies, but Don Herzfeld is a very

232
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:35,414
smart man, his internal barriers are that he has

233
00:14:35,714 --> 00:14:38,276
no training as an animator, he can barely draw

234
00:14:38,357 --> 00:14:41,199
more than a stick person, and he actually has zero

235
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,501
internal desire to improve or be commercially successful.

236
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:49,127
His external barriers were that in real life,

237
00:14:49,448 --> 00:14:51,889
when he made this, he had no job, he had no money,

238
00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:55,411
he had very limited time, and he used crappy equipment

239
00:14:55,451 --> 00:14:56,691
that no one else even knew existed

240
00:14:56,731 --> 00:14:58,612
in the school where he was working.

241
00:14:59,873 --> 00:15:02,975
And that sounds like a fantastic recipe for failure.

242
00:15:04,135 --> 00:15:05,316
And in the film, it is.

243
00:15:06,597 --> 00:15:08,058
All of his cartoons are rejected,

244
00:15:08,598 --> 00:15:10,039
their creator loses his mind,

245
00:15:10,719 --> 00:15:12,960
and the animated world collapses in on itself.

246
00:15:14,301 --> 00:15:15,181
And it's on purpose.

247
00:15:17,102 --> 00:15:23,703
To date, this weird guy who basically hates money, works by himself and draws stick people

248
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:28,844
has created six short films, two features, a couch gag for the Simpsons, and has been

249
00:15:28,884 --> 00:15:34,065
nominated for an Academy Award twice. How many people that work at those other studios

250
00:15:34,105 --> 00:15:40,146
have done something like that? They have their own barriers, by the way. Luxury is one of

251
00:15:40,186 --> 00:15:42,406
the biggest barriers you will ever face.

252
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:47,934
He had barriers and he used them as part of his creation

253
00:15:48,274 --> 00:15:49,836
instead of a reason to stop,

254
00:15:50,357 --> 00:15:52,098
or even worse, a reason not to start.

255
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:55,802
This is a great strategy.

256
00:15:56,183 --> 00:15:58,045
That is an amazing consideration of scope.

257
00:16:00,478 --> 00:16:06,821
So when you're coming up with what you're aiming for in your prototype, these are some

258
00:16:06,861 --> 00:16:14,263
words of wisdom that I lean on. It's a quote by Arthur Ashe, start where you are, use what

259
00:16:14,303 --> 00:16:19,145
you have and do what you can. Don't try to be somebody else that has a whole different

260
00:16:19,165 --> 00:16:25,867
situation. Listen to your humility. All right, vision. Vision for me is two parts, game and

261
00:16:25,907 --> 00:16:26,167
design.

262
00:16:28,066 --> 00:16:35,172
The first part is the game, a game concept, generally a specific imagined solution.

263
00:16:36,273 --> 00:16:42,239
And it is designed to capture a theme, it highlights a goal, and you want it to describe

264
00:16:42,259 --> 00:16:48,364
the user experience and get everybody inspired and desirous to make that thing.

265
00:16:49,445 --> 00:16:53,849
And it typically comes in the form of either a description or a piece of art.

266
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:54,730
Or both.

267
00:16:55,868 --> 00:17:01,731
So let's say I was designing Pacâ€‘Man, my game concept might be a game about eating

268
00:17:02,572 --> 00:17:09,035
everything and avoiding ghosts. Or if I really wanted to persuade you, maybe I would craft

269
00:17:09,075 --> 00:17:10,255
an awesome image such as this.

270
00:17:13,524 --> 00:17:18,747
And the second part of vision is submitting a plan for how your game concept can be

271
00:17:18,827 --> 00:17:24,550
executed. This is generally done with rough design mockups of possible implementation.

272
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:30,433
And these should be quick and dirty, easy to understand, correctly formatted to the

273
00:17:30,473 --> 00:17:35,856
parameters of whatever platform you're making your project for, and appropriately

274
00:17:35,956 --> 00:17:37,577
scoped. Thank goodness we covered that.

275
00:17:40,156 --> 00:17:42,778
So the word possible is really key here.

276
00:17:43,338 --> 00:17:46,601
These are not final blueprints to be slavishly followed.

277
00:17:47,141 --> 00:17:49,944
They are educated guesses for a place to start

278
00:17:50,244 --> 00:17:51,525
so that you can hit the ground running.

279
00:17:53,646 --> 00:17:55,868
And to me, vision is the foundation of game design.

280
00:17:56,389 --> 00:17:58,470
The obvious but frequent pitfall

281
00:17:58,891 --> 00:18:00,832
is to spend too much energy on the first half

282
00:18:01,252 --> 00:18:02,333
and not enough on the second.

283
00:18:04,557 --> 00:18:07,640
So this is a tool that I found to help keep those in balance.

284
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,102
I discovered this through a blog post

285
00:18:10,182 --> 00:18:11,903
by Charmy Kim on Gamasutra.

286
00:18:12,403 --> 00:18:13,704
It's called A Core Diagram,

287
00:18:13,924 --> 00:18:15,946
and the idea is to approach understanding

288
00:18:15,986 --> 00:18:18,248
and evaluating a vision from the core app.

289
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:22,591
So for game design specifically,

290
00:18:22,611 --> 00:18:25,353
your core mechanic is where it all starts.

291
00:18:25,393 --> 00:18:27,195
This is the purposeful interaction

292
00:18:27,235 --> 00:18:28,456
that occurs most frequently.

293
00:18:30,534 --> 00:18:33,495
and layered on top of your core is the secondary mechanics.

294
00:18:34,035 --> 00:18:36,135
These are the interactions that happen less frequently.

295
00:18:38,456 --> 00:18:42,497
Progression is the conditions required for progress,

296
00:18:43,037 --> 00:18:43,417
of course.

297
00:18:44,057 --> 00:18:45,738
It's a system that envelops the mechanics

298
00:18:46,238 --> 00:18:49,619
through a required series of conditions to create change.

299
00:18:50,705 --> 00:18:56,868
on a holistic level. And narrative puts all the inner layers into context, usually through a

300
00:18:56,928 --> 00:19:02,591
theme and overall goal. And how you fill these layers and the degree to which they relate to

301
00:19:02,671 --> 00:19:06,493
one another will have a dramatic impact on your game and on your vision.

302
00:19:08,311 --> 00:19:09,992
So let's go back to our Pac-Man example.

303
00:19:11,452 --> 00:19:13,613
This is how the core diagram looks

304
00:19:13,893 --> 00:19:16,334
when we plug in my game concept.

305
00:19:17,095 --> 00:19:19,776
Core mechanic is eat, secondary is chase,

306
00:19:20,136 --> 00:19:21,517
progression is clear mazes,

307
00:19:21,917 --> 00:19:23,638
and the narrative is eat or be eaten.

308
00:19:25,198 --> 00:19:25,918
Is that right?

309
00:19:26,939 --> 00:19:29,320
If you close your eyes and you imagine yourself

310
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,322
playing Pac-Man, is eating the core mechanic of Pac-Man?

311
00:19:37,603 --> 00:19:42,804
core mechanic of Pac-Man is move. If you do not move, then you do not eat. If you do not

312
00:19:42,844 --> 00:19:48,685
move, you will lose. Eating is a secondary mechanic. Knowing what your core mechanic is

313
00:19:48,745 --> 00:19:57,387
can help you figure out what that viable or that minimum viable interaction needs to be. And

314
00:19:57,407 --> 00:20:02,228
knowing that can go a long way in helping you sketch up some simple explanation for an

315
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:02,908
implementation.

316
00:20:04,045 --> 00:20:05,687
a possible implementation of design.

317
00:20:05,707 --> 00:20:07,468
In this case, it's the correct one.

318
00:20:09,651 --> 00:20:13,014
And in my opinion, you need both parts

319
00:20:13,535 --> 00:20:14,616
to form an effective vision.

320
00:20:14,636 --> 00:20:18,239
Okay, let's talk about process.

321
00:20:21,122 --> 00:20:22,904
I think process gets a bad rap.

322
00:20:24,626 --> 00:20:26,127
And the reason is that some people...

323
00:20:28,636 --> 00:20:31,958
that for some people, like project managers specifically,

324
00:20:32,419 --> 00:20:33,520
it feels very comfortable.

325
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,901
And for the dev team,

326
00:20:36,322 --> 00:20:39,004
it can be totally rigid and uncomfortable.

327
00:20:39,944 --> 00:20:43,227
And that's because there's just no one size fits all solution.

328
00:20:45,408 --> 00:20:46,689
But that doesn't mean you shouldn't do it.

329
00:20:47,069 --> 00:20:50,712
This is especially common with small teams

330
00:20:50,972 --> 00:20:52,113
or individual developers.

331
00:20:53,854 --> 00:20:56,055
I like to imagine process as the invisible tracks

332
00:20:56,215 --> 00:20:57,696
on which the development train runs.

333
00:20:58,196 --> 00:21:00,318
It makes everything faster, a lot less bumpy.

334
00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:03,960
But the thing about process that makes it feel merciless

335
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,702
is it just, it doesn't care what's most convenient

336
00:21:06,722 --> 00:21:07,403
to you right now.

337
00:21:08,063 --> 00:21:10,265
It cares about sustaining a development over time,

338
00:21:10,405 --> 00:21:12,526
keeping it moving in one direction.

339
00:21:13,206 --> 00:21:16,409
It's the small, tiny sacrifices that you make

340
00:21:16,629 --> 00:21:20,031
for the greater good, exactly like exercise

341
00:21:20,091 --> 00:21:20,792
or eating healthy.

342
00:21:22,092 --> 00:21:25,935
And if you don't like the processes that you've worked with before or the process you have

343
00:21:26,055 --> 00:21:33,639
currently, find another one that suits your needs. I think processes are an inherently

344
00:21:33,719 --> 00:21:40,503
personal thing that we try to just pull off the shelf. Take the time to decide or to explore

345
00:21:40,523 --> 00:21:45,686
and decide on what parts of different processes are working for you.

346
00:21:48,441 --> 00:21:54,005
These are a few that I like a lot and I borrowed liberally from. Agile development in some

347
00:21:54,065 --> 00:21:59,528
form is what you're likely to find at just about any professional game studio. Lean startup

348
00:21:59,548 --> 00:22:03,851
method we already talked about by Eric Ries. It centers around minimum viability and

349
00:22:03,891 --> 00:22:08,054
validated learning. But the one I'm most excited about and the one that I just tested

350
00:22:08,114 --> 00:22:12,777
recently is called Sprint. It's by Jake Knapp. He's from Google Ventures.

351
00:22:15,295 --> 00:22:17,979
What I like about this method is that it's a week long.

352
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:22,204
And you build your prototype in one day.

353
00:22:22,224 --> 00:22:24,487
How can that not inspire you?

354
00:22:25,088 --> 00:22:29,133
So I gave it a shot, and I tracked my results.

355
00:22:29,975 --> 00:22:32,177
Not exactly, I needed a little break in there.

356
00:22:34,442 --> 00:22:38,905
I took nine days. Also he worked with a team of seven people. I did it by myself. And real

357
00:22:38,945 --> 00:22:43,768
quickly before we wrap up, because I only have five minutes, I'm going to quickly show what

358
00:22:43,808 --> 00:22:48,350
these five steps look like in practice. Don't worry about the details. If you want to know

359
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:52,673
those, just check out the book or look online. He has all kinds of YouTube videos. Okay, so

360
00:22:52,693 --> 00:22:59,097
this is make a map and choose a target. Here I'm outlining my goal, the questions I want to

361
00:22:59,217 --> 00:23:03,279
answer and what I want to build, which is a playable prototype. Makes sense?

362
00:23:04,947 --> 00:23:09,933
I decided to make a game about working at a dog rescue, a mix between Tamagotchi and

363
00:23:09,953 --> 00:23:15,879
Papers, Please. What could go wrong? These are just some rough sketches of possible

364
00:23:15,899 --> 00:23:19,623
implementations. I used to be a professional artist.

365
00:23:20,444 --> 00:23:28,111
This is a good level. You can do this. Don Hertzfeld. These are the possible solution

366
00:23:28,151 --> 00:23:32,595
sketches that I came up with. And again, I drew nothing here. I grabbed all this from Google

367
00:23:32,635 --> 00:23:37,619
images. Even the dogs. I did no actual drawing. Just laying things out in Photoshop.

368
00:23:40,463 --> 00:23:45,485
Then to build the interactive prototype, I used a program called Proto I O. I used their free

369
00:23:45,525 --> 00:23:52,466
trial. You can also use Balsamiq. It's free. It is a wire framing program that lets you create

370
00:23:52,566 --> 00:23:58,227
two scale interactive testable and shareable design mockups in a really short amount of

371
00:23:58,267 --> 00:24:03,528
time without any coding. And I sent this version that I made out over Facebook.

372
00:24:04,836 --> 00:24:09,660
and I asked for feedback and to my very pleasant surprise, a programmer I knew wanted to help

373
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:17,466
me take it a step further. And he put a few weeks of code on it and then I conducted user

374
00:24:17,486 --> 00:24:23,511
testing through anonymous surveys made possible by SurveyMonkey, also free. And then I

375
00:24:24,092 --> 00:24:29,116
scheduled five halfâ€‘hour user tests with people that represented my target audience.

376
00:24:31,482 --> 00:24:33,924
And that is the prototype I'm currently working on.

377
00:24:35,605 --> 00:24:37,747
All of that took about a month

378
00:24:38,587 --> 00:24:39,768
to get the code and everything in there.

379
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:42,130
So in conclusion, here we are.

380
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:46,573
I would say be resourceful, not a resource.

381
00:24:46,633 --> 00:24:48,215
These are all fortune cookies, sorry guys.

382
00:24:49,516 --> 00:24:51,617
Optimize for interactions, not ideas.

383
00:24:51,637 --> 00:24:53,098
I hope somebody makes fortune cookies.

384
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:56,701
Goals are your foundations, make them strong.

385
00:24:57,342 --> 00:24:58,903
Scope with wisdom, not wishes.

386
00:24:59,951 --> 00:25:06,632
Vision is a lot of work, not just an idea. And process is necessary. But if you remember only

387
00:25:06,812 --> 00:25:13,614
one single thing that I said in this whole talk, go do a game jam. Seriously. None of this,

388
00:25:13,994 --> 00:25:17,794
everything I showed you, everything you've done at GDC so far will compare to what you learn

389
00:25:17,834 --> 00:25:23,015
in 24 hours of actual experience. The two most popular are Ludum Dare and Global Game Jam. If

390
00:25:23,035 --> 00:25:28,956
you want to find out more or start your own, go to itch.io and click on the game jams tab.

391
00:25:30,162 --> 00:25:37,732
and that is all I have. Thank you so much. I'm sorry that was so fast.

392
00:25:38,053 --> 00:25:39,715
If you want to get a hold of me, that's how you do it.
