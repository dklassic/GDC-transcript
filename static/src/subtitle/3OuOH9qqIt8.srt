00:00:06,225 --> 00:00:11,486
Hello, my name is Josh Sher, and I am a writer at Naughty Dog.

2
00:00:11,486 --> 00:00:14,186
I have been there for about 17 years now,

3
00:00:14,186 --> 00:00:16,647
and I have worn many hats.

4
00:00:16,647 --> 00:00:18,247
Most recently, I was the co-writer

5
00:00:18,247 --> 00:00:20,727
on Uncharted, The Lost Legacy, and that

6
00:00:20,727 --> 00:00:22,108
is our topic of discussion today.

7
00:00:22,108 --> 00:00:25,088
Specifically, character development

8
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:28,309
in non-linear spaces, meaning that we

9
00:00:28,309 --> 00:00:32,010
created our first open world section for The Lost Legacy,

10
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,010
which is a large exploratory section in the Western Ghats

11
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:35,730
region of India.

12
00:00:36,808 --> 00:00:39,850
And it required that we rethink our tried and true narrative

13
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:40,871
techniques.

14
00:00:40,871 --> 00:00:45,294
Now, one little caveat is that I did the outline for this talk,

15
00:00:45,294 --> 00:00:47,755
and I realized I had about 70 minutes worth of material.

16
00:00:47,755 --> 00:00:49,696
And this is a 30-minute talk.

17
00:00:49,696 --> 00:00:52,518
So I turned this into kind of a high-level case study,

18
00:00:52,518 --> 00:00:55,300
a look at our thought process, or if you prefer,

19
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,341
our making it up as we go along process.

20
00:00:57,341 --> 00:00:58,822
But I was curious.

21
00:00:58,822 --> 00:01:01,203
How many of you have played an Uncharted game in here?

22
00:01:01,203 --> 00:01:02,064
OK, cool.

23
00:01:02,064 --> 00:01:05,006
How many of you have played Lost Legacy?

24
00:01:05,905 --> 00:01:11,207
Also cool. Very cool. All right. Well, just so everybody knows, it's very difficult to talk

25
00:01:11,207 --> 00:01:15,309
about the story without giving away little bits and pieces. Nothing on the order of

26
00:01:15,309 --> 00:01:22,611
Darth Vader's loose father. Everybody knows that, right? Okay. But, so apologies in advance.

27
00:01:22,611 --> 00:01:28,753
For those of you not familiar with the franchise, Uncharted is a modern-day pulp action adventure

28
00:01:28,753 --> 00:01:34,536
starring one Nathan Drake, treasure hunter, thrill seeker, purveyor of fine quips. But,

29
00:01:34,536 --> 00:01:35,616
after the fourth game,

30
00:01:36,141 --> 00:01:39,384
we had this opportunity to do a spin-off title.

31
00:01:39,384 --> 00:01:42,847
Bigger still, a opportunity to break away from Nathan Drake

32
00:01:42,847 --> 00:01:46,770
and apply the Uncharted template to some new protagonists.

33
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,312
And we decided to go with Chloe Frazier.

34
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:51,734
She is a fan favorite from Uncharted 2,

35
00:01:51,734 --> 00:01:54,997
and she's kind of a dark mirror version of Drake.

36
00:01:54,997 --> 00:01:57,038
She's also a skilled treasure hunter and thief,

37
00:01:57,038 --> 00:01:59,580
but whereas Drake's got a hero's complex,

38
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,243
she's a lot more about self-preservation,

39
00:02:02,243 --> 00:02:04,084
even at the expense of her friends and allies.

40
00:02:05,315 --> 00:02:11,877
So with that, we decided to form the basis of our story around a moment where she had to make a conscious decision

41
00:02:11,877 --> 00:02:14,738
to risk her life for the sake of others for the greater good.

42
00:02:14,738 --> 00:02:19,620
Now, once we've established the foundation of her arc, we next considered who her companion would be.

43
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:24,021
See, we like having companion characters in our games.

44
00:02:24,021 --> 00:02:28,843
Apart from helping out in the fight, they bring out different facets of our character that you might not see otherwise.

45
00:02:29,618 --> 00:02:32,159
And companions are also great for building character

46
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:34,719
through conversations and shared moments.

47
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:37,780
In fact, when you see an Uncharted protagonist

48
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,181
on their own, it's usually because they screwed up

49
00:02:40,181 --> 00:02:40,641
big time.

50
00:02:40,641 --> 00:02:45,743
So to recap, we want someone who provides contrast and conflict,

51
00:02:45,743 --> 00:02:48,743
someone who draws out the inner aspects of your main character

52
00:02:48,743 --> 00:02:50,704
and can be a catalyst for change.

53
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:53,685
We considered many possibilities,

54
00:02:53,685 --> 00:02:56,226
but we kept circling back to Nadine Ross.

55
00:02:56,226 --> 00:02:58,386
She was one of our antagonists from Uncharted 4.

56
00:02:59,743 --> 00:03:02,925
She is the only antagonist to actually survive an Uncharted game.

57
00:03:02,925 --> 00:03:09,629
You know, very small club. She's at a kind of an interesting place in her life.

58
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:14,271
At the end of Uncharted 4, she has lost control of Shoreline, her private military company.

59
00:03:14,271 --> 00:03:18,954
She's somebody who's used to commanding an army, but now she's been reduced to asking

60
00:03:18,954 --> 00:03:21,616
Chloe Frazier, this low-life treasure hunter, for help and a job.

61
00:03:21,616 --> 00:03:26,438
Equally important, she also provided some interesting contrast for Chloe.

62
00:03:27,023 --> 00:03:29,826
Lots of good opportunities for growth and conflict for the both of them.

63
00:03:29,826 --> 00:03:35,710
And their similarities and differences, along with Chloe's arc from selfish to selfless,

64
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:39,153
would form the basis for the relationship for the game.

65
00:03:39,153 --> 00:03:42,495
So, we have our characters, and next we need a story.

66
00:03:42,495 --> 00:03:46,719
So here is a very brief rundown of the Naughty Dog process.

67
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:50,261
With our games, the goal is to seamlessly combine story and gameplay.

68
00:03:50,261 --> 00:03:53,704
And as such, the story and design teams are in constant communication.

69
00:03:54,335 --> 00:03:57,775
The writers and directors developed the story outline and the beats.

70
00:03:57,775 --> 00:04:00,396
Most days that was some combination of myself,

71
00:04:00,396 --> 00:04:02,796
creative director and co-writer Shauna Sky,

72
00:04:02,796 --> 00:04:05,757
game director Kurt Margenau, and lead designer James Cooper.

73
00:04:05,757 --> 00:04:08,138
Now, while we're breaking down the story,

74
00:04:08,138 --> 00:04:11,918
the designers are busy prototyping gameplay mechanics and levels.

75
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:16,819
But the teams often meet to share progress and make suggestions.

76
00:04:16,819 --> 00:04:19,300
And in the early days, the story can be adjusted

77
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,760
to accommodate design and vice versa.

78
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,941
So we try to get as much of that done early as we can.

79
00:04:24,466 --> 00:04:27,509
And ultimately, we create what we call the story macro.

80
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:30,091
It's kind of a roadmap for a story and design.

81
00:04:30,091 --> 00:04:32,493
It gets the whole team on the same page.

82
00:04:32,493 --> 00:04:35,076
We never write the entire script and hand it to designers

83
00:04:35,076 --> 00:04:37,218
and say, here, go make this, because we

84
00:04:37,218 --> 00:04:38,999
want to keep things nice and fluid to allow

85
00:04:38,999 --> 00:04:40,220
for changes and improvements.

86
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,243
Now, not to say that anything's set in stone.

87
00:04:43,243 --> 00:04:44,705
It's still a living document.

88
00:04:44,705 --> 00:04:47,427
And we continue to fill in these story details.

89
00:04:47,427 --> 00:04:50,250
Now, to quickly summarize Lost Legacy for those

90
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:50,930
who haven't played it.

91
00:04:51,153 --> 00:04:56,515
Treasure hunter Chloe Frazier has hired ex-mercenary Nadeen Ross to help her explore India

92
00:04:56,515 --> 00:04:59,415
and to recover the priceless and fictional Tusk of Ganesh.

93
00:04:59,415 --> 00:05:03,577
Before Asav, a cunning insurgent commander, uses it for his own nefarious purposes,

94
00:05:03,577 --> 00:05:05,517
and we're off to the races.

95
00:05:05,517 --> 00:05:11,539
Now, we design our games around a paradigm that we call the active cinematic experience.

96
00:05:11,539 --> 00:05:13,720
Active being the key.

97
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,721
We like to keep things on the stick,

98
00:05:15,721 --> 00:05:18,822
because we feel that moments conveyed through gameplay have a bigger impact.

99
00:05:20,052 --> 00:05:23,093
And we aim to sell a single cohesive story,

100
00:05:23,093 --> 00:05:24,454
no branching narratives.

101
00:05:24,454 --> 00:05:26,114
We do allow a lot of player agency

102
00:05:26,114 --> 00:05:28,855
within the confines of a level and the gameplay mechanics,

103
00:05:28,855 --> 00:05:32,357
but we cannot let them affect the outcome of the story.

104
00:05:32,357 --> 00:05:35,918
And we call this the wide linear approach.

105
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:38,039
But since we know where the character and the player

106
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:39,139
are going to be at all times,

107
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:41,160
we can plot the character relationship

108
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,420
and write accordingly,

109
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,881
and we can tailor the visuals and narrative

110
00:05:43,881 --> 00:05:45,001
for the maximum impact.

111
00:05:45,001 --> 00:05:49,163
And that's kind of why we've avoided open world design.

112
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:53,746
Pacing is paramount in our games, and with Open World, the player sets the pace.

113
00:05:53,746 --> 00:05:58,268
And if the player doesn't feel the same urgency that your characters do, it kind of throws

114
00:05:58,268 --> 00:05:59,349
things off.

115
00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:03,291
And also, quite frankly, we want you to actually see all that beautiful and expensive content

116
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:04,672
that we've produced.

117
00:06:04,672 --> 00:06:11,776
So the thing is, that approach hasn't always jived with the exploratory spirit of the Uncharted

118
00:06:11,776 --> 00:06:12,816
series.

119
00:06:12,816 --> 00:06:16,618
So in Uncharted 4, we decided to dip our toe in the water a little bit.

120
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:20,122
So there was the Madagascar level, which was massive,

121
00:06:20,122 --> 00:06:22,442
with some wide exploratory loops.

122
00:06:22,442 --> 00:06:24,403
But ultimately, we funneled you along this linear path.

123
00:06:24,403 --> 00:06:28,464
And then there was also the At Sea chapter.

124
00:06:28,464 --> 00:06:31,265
Massive, lots of places to wander,

125
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:33,526
but we signposted you to a trigger point that

126
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:35,206
unlocked a linear path through the level.

127
00:06:35,206 --> 00:06:37,947
Now, our takeaway from this is that even though these levels

128
00:06:37,947 --> 00:06:40,868
weren't open per se, the pacing of these levels

129
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:43,348
had to allow for the player taking their time.

130
00:06:43,348 --> 00:06:44,929
It couldn't be too urgent or dire.

131
00:06:44,929 --> 00:06:45,629
The whole.

132
00:06:46,104 --> 00:06:48,505
don't worry I'll save you. What's that shiny thing over there?

133
00:06:48,505 --> 00:06:51,626
Problem. It's kind of hard to keep the player immersed when they're distracted.

134
00:06:51,626 --> 00:06:56,908
But we knew that the Lost Legacy might be the last Uncharted game, so we kind

135
00:06:56,908 --> 00:07:01,230
of decided to go for it and create a true open space. Our chapter

136
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:05,371
set in the Western Ghats region of India. And we soon discovered that creating a

137
00:07:05,371 --> 00:07:09,292
narrative in an open space required that we rethink our usual working methods.

138
00:07:09,292 --> 00:07:12,614
And the Western Ghats was the largest explorable space that we've ever made.

139
00:07:12,614 --> 00:07:15,615
So in this level, Chloe and Nadine...

140
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:21,767
climb a tower, conveniently placed as a vantage point. They find three ancient Hoysala empire

141
00:07:21,767 --> 00:07:27,071
fortresses, each a mini-level into itself, and inside you climb cliffs, you solve puzzles,

142
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:33,655
and you fight dudes. And once inside, you also find and activate these old valves to open the

143
00:07:33,655 --> 00:07:39,139
secret gate to the city of Halibidu. And if you feel so inclined, you also find 11 optional doodads

144
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:43,362
scattered in various places and bring them back to a shrine overrun with monkeys.

145
00:07:45,521 --> 00:07:50,505
With all the different places that you can visit, and in any order,

146
00:07:50,505 --> 00:07:53,768
it all kind of adds up to a lot of different ways to play through the level.

147
00:07:53,768 --> 00:07:58,671
Impossible to account for all of them, let alone write for all of them.

148
00:07:58,671 --> 00:08:02,494
So, given that, how do we give the player freedom to choose their path while,

149
00:08:02,494 --> 00:08:06,217
one, developing Chloe and Nadine's relationship in a consistent way,

150
00:08:06,217 --> 00:08:09,040
and two, not completely blowing our budget and our time constraints?

151
00:08:10,422 --> 00:08:12,984
So we started doing what we do with every level, which

152
00:08:12,984 --> 00:08:15,266
is to determine which moments need to occur

153
00:08:15,266 --> 00:08:17,148
and what info needs to be conveyed to the player.

154
00:08:17,148 --> 00:08:22,392
So we created this ever-evolving list, which gradually got

155
00:08:22,392 --> 00:08:23,413
narrowed down to this.

156
00:08:23,413 --> 00:08:25,555
That's kind of a lot.

157
00:08:25,555 --> 00:08:28,697
And you certainly don't want to do it all in the cut scenes.

158
00:08:28,697 --> 00:08:31,239
Now, it's important to remember, also,

159
00:08:31,239 --> 00:08:34,082
that this is just one chapter in the game, a big one.

160
00:08:34,082 --> 00:08:37,044
But still, we're not going from rrr to high five,

161
00:08:37,044 --> 00:08:39,266
more like professional to tentatively friendly.

162
00:08:39,703 --> 00:08:41,945
So all the dialogue had to be calibrated accordingly.

163
00:08:41,945 --> 00:08:45,767
So next, we needed to determine where

164
00:08:45,767 --> 00:08:48,769
we were going to be doling all that information out.

165
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:50,830
So we started by considering the player's main goals

166
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:55,073
for the level, meaning the actions required in order

167
00:08:55,073 --> 00:08:56,634
to progress.

168
00:08:56,634 --> 00:08:59,235
Any story progression needed to be tied

169
00:08:59,235 --> 00:09:01,256
to one of those key elements.

170
00:09:01,256 --> 00:09:04,338
Now, moving along to the next phase of Chloe and Nadine.

171
00:09:04,338 --> 00:09:05,779
Can I just say Chloe Dino?

172
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:05,899
OK.

173
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:08,410
Moving on to the next phase of Clodin's relationship

174
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,692
was thus tied to players activating one of the three

175
00:09:10,692 --> 00:09:13,613
valves and thus completing one of the three forts.

176
00:09:13,613 --> 00:09:15,194
For everything else in the level,

177
00:09:15,194 --> 00:09:17,255
whether it was the monkey shrine, the tower,

178
00:09:17,255 --> 00:09:20,277
the collectible tokens, we couldn't tie the key character

179
00:09:20,277 --> 00:09:22,738
moments to those because there was no guarantee the player

180
00:09:22,738 --> 00:09:23,519
would ever see it.

181
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,420
For the same reason, nothing outside those key events

182
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:29,082
could be vital to the player's understanding of the story.

183
00:09:29,082 --> 00:09:32,464
And what's more, we realized that all the dialogue

184
00:09:32,464 --> 00:09:34,425
in the level had to be written with a neutral tone

185
00:09:34,425 --> 00:09:35,085
as a baseline.

186
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:39,913
Not too friendly, not too cold, because otherwise, depending on where you heard it,

187
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,275
it could feel out of order. But more on that in a little bit.

188
00:09:42,275 --> 00:09:48,761
So having determined where we would advance the story and the characters, the next step was

189
00:09:48,761 --> 00:09:53,905
determining how. So which of our narrative tools do we use to deliver which story beats?

190
00:09:53,905 --> 00:10:00,211
We use several tools for developing our characters all along the spectrum of

191
00:10:00,211 --> 00:10:01,852
interactivity and player agency.

192
00:10:02,259 --> 00:10:05,160
So at the top in the non-active cinematic experience zone,

193
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,340
we have cutscenes, and at the bottom,

194
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,521
the dialogue that plays during moment-to-moment gameplay.

195
00:10:09,521 --> 00:10:12,722
Each of these tools have their strengths and weaknesses

196
00:10:12,722 --> 00:10:14,962
when it comes to telling an interactive story.

197
00:10:14,962 --> 00:10:17,243
So I'm going to break it all down like an ancient city.

198
00:10:17,243 --> 00:10:19,443
First, we usually use the tools,

199
00:10:19,443 --> 00:10:22,684
and then we, first I'm gonna tell you how we use the tools,

200
00:10:22,684 --> 00:10:24,424
and then I'm gonna tell you how we adapted them

201
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:26,385
to work in the Western Gods chapter,

202
00:10:26,385 --> 00:10:27,745
starting with the cutscenes.

203
00:10:27,745 --> 00:10:30,006
This is obviously the least interactive way

204
00:10:30,006 --> 00:10:31,046
to tell a story in a game.

205
00:10:31,724 --> 00:10:33,865
but it grants you a captive audience.

206
00:10:33,865 --> 00:10:36,567
So we usually start writing these before anything else

207
00:10:36,567 --> 00:10:38,508
because they're independent enough from the gameplay

208
00:10:38,508 --> 00:10:41,449
that they can be written even before levels are in block mesh form.

209
00:10:41,449 --> 00:10:44,371
And it helps us explore and define our characters.

210
00:10:44,371 --> 00:10:47,373
And because they're not interactive, we try to only employ them

211
00:10:47,373 --> 00:10:51,535
when absolutely necessary and to space them out as widely as possible.

212
00:10:51,535 --> 00:10:53,637
We save them for the key moments where the character beats

213
00:10:53,637 --> 00:10:56,378
where we really want to see the emotion on the character's faces

214
00:10:56,378 --> 00:10:58,560
or we don't want the player to potentially interrupt it.

215
00:10:59,028 --> 00:11:03,390
I won't say it's impossible, it is very difficult to get any of these emotions any other way.

216
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,972
And there, now you don't have to play the game.

217
00:11:05,972 --> 00:11:06,992
Please play the game.

218
00:11:06,992 --> 00:11:13,556
For the Western Gods chapter, we felt that these were the beats best suited for the cut

219
00:11:13,556 --> 00:11:17,298
scenes, as they brought the characters closer and they moved Chloe along from her arc from

220
00:11:17,298 --> 00:11:19,299
selfish to selfless.

221
00:11:19,299 --> 00:11:23,882
Also helping tie Chloe to her Indian heritage and helping set up Nadine's chance for redemption.

222
00:11:24,454 --> 00:11:26,715
Also, setting up Sam Drake's appearance later in the game

223
00:11:26,715 --> 00:11:28,835
for the benefit of people who didn't play Uncharted 4.

224
00:11:28,835 --> 00:11:33,556
So these cut scenes played after Clodine activated a valve

225
00:11:33,556 --> 00:11:34,697
at each of the three forts.

226
00:11:34,697 --> 00:11:37,777
It advanced their relationship in a nice, simple, linear

227
00:11:37,777 --> 00:11:40,558
progression that we could control for maximum narrative

228
00:11:40,558 --> 00:11:41,318
impact.

229
00:11:41,318 --> 00:11:42,699
Easy, right?

230
00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:43,619
Not so much.

231
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:44,439
Why?

232
00:11:44,439 --> 00:11:45,599
Because it's an open world game.

233
00:11:45,599 --> 00:11:49,460
And the player can visit the forts in any order.

234
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,441
If the scenes played out of order,

235
00:11:51,441 --> 00:11:52,701
that would be kind of a disaster.

236
00:11:53,158 --> 00:11:54,999
And shooting the same cut scene to work

237
00:11:54,999 --> 00:11:56,259
in three different locations would

238
00:11:56,259 --> 00:11:57,660
be prohibitively expensive.

239
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:01,941
So the solution was that we made the footprint of the three

240
00:12:01,941 --> 00:12:03,502
valve areas exactly the same.

241
00:12:03,502 --> 00:12:08,003
So instead of shooting three different scenes per fort,

242
00:12:08,003 --> 00:12:09,344
we just shot three scenes.

243
00:12:09,344 --> 00:12:13,185
And they all played out exactly the same way in each location.

244
00:12:13,185 --> 00:12:16,026
That way, we could have the three scenes play

245
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:18,947
in the correct order and allow Clodian's relationship

246
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:22,048
to progress, regardless of the order that you tackle.

247
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:25,910
the forts.

248
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:29,031
And it's not going to let me skip, is it?

249
00:12:29,031 --> 00:12:29,211
Okay.

250
00:12:29,211 --> 00:12:33,792
Next up, scripted sequences.

251
00:12:33,792 --> 00:12:39,534
In some ways, these are kind of interactive cut scenes in that we sometimes control the

252
00:12:39,534 --> 00:12:45,016
camera or we limit the player's moveset somehow so that we can control the moment, but the

253
00:12:45,016 --> 00:12:46,016
player is still in control.

254
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:47,157
It's all interactive.

255
00:12:48,037 --> 00:12:49,998
Our big action set pieces fall into this category,

256
00:12:49,998 --> 00:12:53,720
though sometimes they are also used for more intimate moments,

257
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,081
such as the elephant ride.

258
00:12:55,081 --> 00:12:58,283
This is our active cinematic experience.

259
00:12:58,283 --> 00:13:01,365
Like I said earlier, emotional things

260
00:13:01,365 --> 00:13:04,086
will have a lot more impact if you have it on the stick,

261
00:13:04,086 --> 00:13:04,407
in control.

262
00:13:04,407 --> 00:13:07,228
And more often than not, we use them as a climax

263
00:13:07,228 --> 00:13:07,869
to a story beat.

264
00:13:07,869 --> 00:13:10,190
Now, the thing is, we didn't actually really

265
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,372
have any of these in the Western Ghats chapter,

266
00:13:13,372 --> 00:13:14,753
because in our open world scenario,

267
00:13:15,238 --> 00:13:17,599
There's no controlling the pace or the order of the approach.

268
00:13:17,599 --> 00:13:19,460
And we didn't want players to hit the high point too early.

269
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,301
So we saved them for later.

270
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:24,642
Next up, one of the key components of this chapter,

271
00:13:24,642 --> 00:13:26,923
driving dialogue.

272
00:13:26,923 --> 00:13:29,324
Given the scope of the level, we didn't

273
00:13:29,324 --> 00:13:31,945
want to force players to hoof it all over the place.

274
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:34,326
And what better time to engage in some casual banter

275
00:13:34,326 --> 00:13:39,648
than on a cool road trip to the Western Ghats?

276
00:13:39,648 --> 00:13:42,989
So due to the degree of interactivity,

277
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,650
driving dialogue has some caveats.

278
00:13:45,183 --> 00:13:48,605
First of all, there's no fixed camera, so you can't get up close and personal.

279
00:13:48,605 --> 00:13:51,866
The player could be hitting obstacles, going off drops, etc. etc.

280
00:13:51,866 --> 00:13:58,069
But the biggest thing was that these conversations can be interrupted by the player at any time,

281
00:13:58,069 --> 00:14:03,052
when they get out of the car, or entering an area of interest, or a combat zone.

282
00:14:03,052 --> 00:14:07,154
Now, we developed an interrupt system for Uncharted 4, which we carried over here,

283
00:14:07,154 --> 00:14:10,255
and that enabled us to allow the player to exit the jeep at any time

284
00:14:10,255 --> 00:14:13,197
and have the conversations resume naturally.

285
00:14:13,197 --> 00:14:14,397
But still, player.

286
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,383
controlled interruptions. On top of all that, all the dialogue has to be semi-projected

287
00:14:19,383 --> 00:14:23,166
over the sound of the engine, so it's probably not the best place for Nadine to ask,

288
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:32,033
Chloe, why do you resent your father so much? However, it was still incredibly useful for

289
00:14:32,033 --> 00:14:37,016
progressing Chlodine's relationship. Even though all the driving took place out in the open world,

290
00:14:37,016 --> 00:14:41,019
we didn't have to write the dialogue in a neutral tone because we could progress the

291
00:14:41,019 --> 00:14:42,460
connection between the characters.

292
00:14:43,222 --> 00:14:45,643
we could break up the conversations into phases,

293
00:14:45,643 --> 00:14:47,003
just like we did for the cut scenes.

294
00:14:47,003 --> 00:14:49,885
The first conversation would play at the start of the level,

295
00:14:49,885 --> 00:14:51,526
the second conversation would play

296
00:14:51,526 --> 00:14:52,986
after you got back into the Jeep

297
00:14:52,986 --> 00:14:55,327
when finishing the first fort, and so on and so on.

298
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:58,549
So we were able to utilize topics and moments

299
00:14:58,549 --> 00:15:00,410
that would have made the cut scenes drag,

300
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:02,431
but sound perfectly natural while driving around.

301
00:15:02,431 --> 00:15:05,332
Now, before writing these conversations,

302
00:15:05,332 --> 00:15:06,813
we did have to determine how long

303
00:15:06,813 --> 00:15:08,114
the player would be in the Jeep,

304
00:15:08,114 --> 00:15:10,375
and then write the conversations to fit in that time.

305
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,121
And since they knew the level better than anyone,

306
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:15,383
I asked our QA team to find the shortest time

307
00:15:15,383 --> 00:15:17,144
between key landmarks.

308
00:15:17,144 --> 00:15:19,665
And it turns out the answer was 15 to 20 seconds.

309
00:15:19,665 --> 00:15:22,007
Now, obviously most players will take longer,

310
00:15:22,007 --> 00:15:23,908
but it served as a good guide for how many seconds

311
00:15:23,908 --> 00:15:24,968
the players would definitely hear.

312
00:15:24,968 --> 00:15:27,910
Because once the player entered the next fort,

313
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:30,051
the current conversation would not be resumed later.

314
00:15:30,051 --> 00:15:32,333
One, because it would be too long a separation.

315
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,414
It could be as long as like 20 minutes.

316
00:15:34,414 --> 00:15:36,395
And two, all the conversations would just end up

317
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:37,155
bunching up at the end.

318
00:15:38,572 --> 00:15:41,732
So when writing, I broke the long conversations into three chunks,

319
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,273
each about 15 to 20 seconds long.

320
00:15:43,273 --> 00:15:47,174
So the first chunk was a bit vital to Clodine's character arcs.

321
00:15:47,174 --> 00:15:49,335
You know, here we have Nadine assessing her current status

322
00:15:49,335 --> 00:15:52,335
and Chloe throwing in a bit of her personal philosophy.

323
00:15:52,335 --> 00:15:54,836
And you would definitely hear this bit before getting to the next fort.

324
00:15:54,836 --> 00:15:57,317
The second chunk built on the first

325
00:15:57,317 --> 00:15:59,797
with a bit of Chloe backstory and some Nadine philosophy.

326
00:15:59,797 --> 00:16:01,838
You would probably hear this,

327
00:16:01,838 --> 00:16:03,358
but if you didn't, it wasn't the end of the world.

328
00:16:03,358 --> 00:16:06,499
And then the last chunk, after a pause from the previous ones,

329
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:08,000
would usually reserve for banter.

330
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:11,410
A chance to see the characters talk about things in the outside world.

331
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:14,091
Fun, but not essential, and if you missed it, no big deal.

332
00:16:14,091 --> 00:16:16,952
Now, while this was tricky to plan out,

333
00:16:16,952 --> 00:16:21,313
it was still relatively easy to control the tone and progression of Clodine's relationship,

334
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:25,554
because we knew when the player would be hearing each conversation.

335
00:16:25,554 --> 00:16:28,915
However, this was not the case for level dialogue.

336
00:16:28,915 --> 00:16:33,156
Now, this is the stuff that's spoken by the characters while exploring the level.

337
00:16:33,156 --> 00:16:33,736
100% interactive.

338
00:16:33,736 --> 00:16:38,077
So, to account for all the branching and for all the character progression possibilities...

339
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:41,074
we wrote and recorded nearly three times as much dialogue

340
00:16:41,074 --> 00:16:42,834
for this level than we did for the largest

341
00:16:42,834 --> 00:16:44,515
level in Uncharted 4.

342
00:16:44,515 --> 00:16:45,135
Yow.

343
00:16:45,135 --> 00:16:49,856
On a base level, level dialogue is useful for several things,

344
00:16:49,856 --> 00:16:52,257
giving little nudges and hints, supplementing

345
00:16:52,257 --> 00:16:54,257
environmental storytelling, and filling

346
00:16:54,257 --> 00:16:56,878
in the historical backstory that would have bloated

347
00:16:56,878 --> 00:16:58,298
the length of the cut scenes.

348
00:16:58,298 --> 00:16:59,778
So here's an example from that.

349
00:16:59,778 --> 00:17:01,999
Hey, look, our moments.

350
00:17:01,999 --> 00:17:02,739
You were right, Nadine.

351
00:17:02,739 --> 00:17:04,259
I have my moments.

352
00:17:04,259 --> 00:17:06,100
You thought versions?

353
00:17:07,578 --> 00:17:10,401
It looks to be a mix of Persian and Hoisina.

354
00:17:10,401 --> 00:17:11,281
Here's one of the things.

355
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:15,305
So, nice and simple, but sort of helps build things along.

356
00:17:15,305 --> 00:17:21,170
But, level dialogue is equally important for creating a large number of little tiny character moments.

357
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:23,132
These little moments can really add up to a lot.

358
00:17:23,132 --> 00:17:25,514
And this is where you can get the subtlety in.

359
00:17:25,514 --> 00:17:28,997
Not that the dialogue has to be subtle, and frankly it often isn't,

360
00:17:28,997 --> 00:17:32,901
but over time you build that slow, gradual relationship.

361
00:17:33,413 --> 00:17:38,837
And like I said earlier, when you can get these moments in the gameplay on the stick,

362
00:17:38,837 --> 00:17:42,639
they have a lot more impact on the player.

363
00:17:42,639 --> 00:17:47,442
So here's an example of what we can do through a classic Uncharted valving mechanic.

364
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:48,643
Pull-ups.

365
00:17:48,643 --> 00:17:50,965
Here, give me your hand.

366
00:17:50,965 --> 00:17:55,968
No matter what the player does, Chloe will not take Nadine's hand in this clip.

367
00:17:55,968 --> 00:17:56,788
I'm good, actually.

368
00:17:56,788 --> 00:17:57,148
Okay.

369
00:17:57,148 --> 00:17:58,669
Here, I've got you.

370
00:17:58,669 --> 00:17:59,650
Alright, I can manage.

371
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:00,771
Just accept my help.

372
00:18:00,771 --> 00:18:02,932
Here, though, she doesn't have a choice.

373
00:18:04,067 --> 00:18:05,208
Come on up.

374
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:07,511
Only because you said please.

375
00:18:07,511 --> 00:18:08,211
I didn't expect you.

376
00:18:08,211 --> 00:18:08,512
Oh, no, not me.

377
00:18:08,512 --> 00:18:19,002
OK, so that last clip was cheating a little bit

378
00:18:19,002 --> 00:18:21,865
because it was part of a small mini cutscene.

379
00:18:21,865 --> 00:18:25,868
However, I wanted to point out that up until this point in the game,

380
00:18:25,868 --> 00:18:27,090
that point in the game,

381
00:18:27,402 --> 00:18:30,223
Nadine calls Chloe by her last name, Frazier.

382
00:18:30,223 --> 00:18:32,244
This is the first time that she ever calls her Chloe.

383
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:35,326
And this is something else that we build up to over the course of the game,

384
00:18:35,326 --> 00:18:39,147
using that same mechanic that's very familiar.

385
00:18:39,147 --> 00:18:43,169
Now, we also use level dialogue to give characters more character.

386
00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:47,312
It took us a while to calibrate Nadine's personality.

387
00:18:47,312 --> 00:18:49,433
At first, we made her way too harsh in our early drafts.

388
00:18:49,433 --> 00:18:54,715
And I really wanted to give her something that you wouldn't necessarily expect from a hardened mercenary.

389
00:18:55,595 --> 00:18:57,776
And one night I was thinking of these old animal fact cards

390
00:18:57,776 --> 00:19:00,277
that they used to advertise on TV when I was a kid.

391
00:19:00,277 --> 00:19:02,519
And yeah, $1, $1.

392
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:07,982
And I thought, what if Nadine grew up with a set of these?

393
00:19:07,982 --> 00:19:09,543
And the answer is this.

394
00:19:09,543 --> 00:19:10,163
What?

395
00:19:10,163 --> 00:19:13,145
They're just large flying rodents.

396
00:19:13,145 --> 00:19:14,106
Actually, no, they're not.

397
00:19:14,106 --> 00:19:14,826
Yeah, they are.

398
00:19:14,826 --> 00:19:17,748
They're closer to primates than needles.

399
00:19:17,748 --> 00:19:19,889
OK, well, I'll look it up.

400
00:19:19,889 --> 00:19:21,190
Fraser, over here.

401
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:21,470
Look.

402
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:21,770
What?

403
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:22,671
What is it?

404
00:19:22,671 --> 00:19:23,591
Monkeys.

405
00:19:23,591 --> 00:19:25,072
You seem excited.

406
00:19:25,979 --> 00:19:27,180
I like monkeys.

407
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,983
That's Vesuki, a king of the Nagas,

408
00:19:29,983 --> 00:19:34,006
entities that take the form of the King Cobra.

409
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:37,850
It shows his control over fear and death.

410
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:41,633
Cobras were always my favorite snake.

411
00:19:41,633 --> 00:19:42,574
Don't think I have a favorite snake.

412
00:19:42,574 --> 00:19:45,076
So there are many more examples, but this is kind of a way

413
00:19:45,076 --> 00:19:48,439
to sneak in some little quirks into Nadine's character

414
00:19:48,439 --> 00:19:50,601
without necessarily cluttering up the cut scenes with it.

415
00:19:51,967 --> 00:19:54,448
Now, another tool sort of related to level dialogue

416
00:19:54,448 --> 00:19:56,009
in our arsenal, if there's something

417
00:19:56,009 --> 00:19:58,611
that we want to convey and the gameplay space is just

418
00:19:58,611 --> 00:20:00,672
a little too tight to fit it, we will sometimes

419
00:20:00,672 --> 00:20:03,293
drop in a optional dialogue prompt.

420
00:20:03,293 --> 00:20:07,176
Now, if the player chooses to engage, the dialogue plays out

421
00:20:07,176 --> 00:20:09,077
and we put the player into a forced walk

422
00:20:09,077 --> 00:20:11,298
and they can't climb or otherwise interact.

423
00:20:11,298 --> 00:20:13,600
It's not ideal, but sometimes it's necessary.

424
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:18,309
Now, you can't guarantee that the player is going to hear the dialogue,

425
00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:25,352
but most people have this Pavlovian reaction to seeing a button propped.

426
00:20:25,352 --> 00:20:29,573
So, sometimes we put in a little exposition,

427
00:20:29,573 --> 00:20:33,034
sometimes a little character moment, and sometimes a little bit of both.

428
00:20:33,034 --> 00:20:33,254
Wow, nice shot.

429
00:20:33,254 --> 00:20:36,736
Persians must have had a trebuchet.

430
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:37,356
A trebuchet?

431
00:20:37,356 --> 00:20:40,857
Can't you just say catapult like a normal person?

432
00:20:41,504 --> 00:20:43,205
A trebuchet is a type of catapult.

433
00:20:43,205 --> 00:20:47,127
It can handle heavier projectiles, like this one.

434
00:20:47,127 --> 00:20:49,448
And fling them longer distances.

435
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:54,750
Right. You learned that in your military training?

436
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,451
I looked it up on Wikipedia.

437
00:20:57,451 --> 00:21:00,012
Like a normal person.

438
00:21:00,012 --> 00:21:00,593
Hey! Where's Sam?

439
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:01,133
Don't think he has a rope?

440
00:21:01,133 --> 00:21:01,653
Oh, right. Forgot about that.

441
00:21:01,653 --> 00:21:02,213
He can sort it out.

442
00:21:02,213 --> 00:21:05,835
Hey, thanks for not murdering Sam, by the way.

443
00:21:05,835 --> 00:21:08,156
We might prove useful later.

444
00:21:08,156 --> 00:21:10,757
There you go. Good. Positive attitude.

445
00:21:11,758 --> 00:21:13,378
Good act as a key point.

446
00:21:13,378 --> 00:21:16,519
Brought some fire away from us.

447
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:21,920
Blown himself on a grenade and saved us all.

448
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,080
Come on.

449
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,920
We're exposed up here.

450
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,101
You know, I feel so much safer with her around.

451
00:21:27,101 --> 00:21:30,401
I never would have found you without her help, OK?

452
00:21:30,401 --> 00:21:30,842
OK.

453
00:21:30,842 --> 00:21:32,542
She just wants to kill me.

454
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:34,422
Well, don't give her a reason to.

455
00:21:34,422 --> 00:21:37,643
So all that stuff, all those different techniques

456
00:21:37,643 --> 00:21:40,443
for level dialogue worth.

457
00:21:40,902 --> 00:21:45,544
beautifully in, I need a little more time because we started late.

458
00:21:45,544 --> 00:21:48,046
All this stuff works beautifully in linear design.

459
00:21:48,046 --> 00:21:51,607
And the way that we designed our cut scenes and our driving dialogue, we still had control

460
00:21:51,607 --> 00:21:51,907
over those.

461
00:21:51,907 --> 00:21:56,369
But the dialogue and the ports themselves, or anywhere else in the world, no.

462
00:21:56,369 --> 00:22:01,812
Since the player could explore the port interiors and other places in any order, what we wrote

463
00:22:01,812 --> 00:22:03,373
couldn't have a linear progression.

464
00:22:03,373 --> 00:22:06,094
It could wreck the flow if you hit it at the wrong time.

465
00:22:06,094 --> 00:22:08,655
So again, we wrote the dialogue with a neutral tone to reflect that.

466
00:22:09,217 --> 00:22:13,718
But we could build on the neutral dialogue to better reflect the current state of Clodine's relationship.

467
00:22:13,718 --> 00:22:16,999
Depending on where you were and how many forts you completed,

468
00:22:16,999 --> 00:22:20,520
we could add to or replace the neutral dialogue with something more friendly.

469
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,341
There are literally hundreds of places we did this in the level.

470
00:22:23,341 --> 00:22:26,062
So here's an example of how we build on neutral dialogue.

471
00:22:26,062 --> 00:22:29,863
The neutral version, the one that plays if this is the first fort you've found, come first.

472
00:22:29,863 --> 00:22:32,804
Then we build on it a little for the second, and then more for the third.

473
00:22:32,804 --> 00:22:34,684
You'll see a little fort icon in the lower left.

474
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,351
Oh, shit!

475
00:22:38,351 --> 00:22:38,451
Oi!

476
00:22:38,451 --> 00:22:42,133
Well, you made it across at least.

477
00:22:42,133 --> 00:22:43,173
Damn it.

478
00:22:43,173 --> 00:22:44,714
See another way over here?

479
00:22:44,714 --> 00:22:45,154
Sit tight.

480
00:22:45,154 --> 00:22:45,934
Or stand.

481
00:22:45,934 --> 00:22:46,995
Stand tight!

482
00:22:46,995 --> 00:22:47,415
Copy that!

483
00:22:47,415 --> 00:22:48,015
Another way.

484
00:22:48,015 --> 00:22:48,495
Oh, shit!

485
00:22:48,495 --> 00:22:50,056
Oi!

486
00:22:50,056 --> 00:22:52,497
Well, you made it across at least.

487
00:22:52,497 --> 00:22:52,617
Sorry.

488
00:22:52,617 --> 00:22:56,379
I'm sure you can find your way over here.

489
00:22:56,379 --> 00:22:58,600
Oh, definitely.

490
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:03,062
Figured you'd want to take the easy way over.

491
00:23:03,062 --> 00:23:04,463
...across at least.

492
00:23:04,463 --> 00:23:04,783
Sorry.

493
00:23:05,543 --> 00:23:07,924
I'm sure you can find your way over here.

494
00:23:07,924 --> 00:23:12,547
Oh, definitely. Figured you'd want to take the easy way over.

495
00:23:12,547 --> 00:23:15,308
Oh, please. Show me how it's done.

496
00:23:15,308 --> 00:23:15,669
Watch and learn.

497
00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:20,391
So through this, we can build up the relationship depending on how far you've progressed when you make it to that point.

498
00:23:20,391 --> 00:23:24,654
Here's another example after successfully taking out some insurgents via stealth.

499
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:27,996
That's it. The site's clear. Not bad, Frazer.

500
00:23:27,996 --> 00:23:30,037
I'll take a not bad from you.

501
00:23:30,037 --> 00:23:32,358
That's it. The site's clear. Not bad, Frazer.

502
00:23:32,358 --> 00:23:34,199
There's hope for you yet.

503
00:23:34,199 --> 00:23:35,140
Thank you.

504
00:23:36,108 --> 00:23:37,468
That was intense.

505
00:23:37,468 --> 00:23:39,549
And one more.

506
00:23:39,549 --> 00:23:39,969
Hey, look who's here.

507
00:23:39,969 --> 00:23:40,109
Huh?

508
00:23:40,109 --> 00:23:45,031
They're Grey Langemonters.

509
00:23:45,031 --> 00:23:48,872
Thanks Jane Goodall.

510
00:23:48,872 --> 00:23:52,513
Hey, look who's here.

511
00:23:52,513 --> 00:23:53,014
Huh?

512
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:56,055
They're Grey Langemonters.

513
00:23:56,055 --> 00:23:57,655
You're adorable.

514
00:23:57,655 --> 00:24:05,518
In the interest of time, I'm going to skip the last example of that and continue.

515
00:24:05,969 --> 00:24:08,391
Now, you may have thought, but Josh,

516
00:24:08,391 --> 00:24:09,812
you left environmental storytelling

517
00:24:09,812 --> 00:24:11,153
off that list of narrative tools.

518
00:24:11,153 --> 00:24:12,573
And you're right.

519
00:24:12,573 --> 00:24:14,154
We don't have too much time to cover it,

520
00:24:14,154 --> 00:24:16,576
but it's in there, obviously, all over the place,

521
00:24:16,576 --> 00:24:18,557
but it's a little bit different and uncharted

522
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:21,179
than something like, say, The Last of Us.

523
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:24,942
With The Last of Us, it's set among, sorry, there we go.

524
00:24:24,942 --> 00:24:29,124
With The Last of Us, it's set among recognizable places

525
00:24:29,124 --> 00:24:30,565
and objects from our modern lives,

526
00:24:30,565 --> 00:24:32,587
and it's much easier to play or to sort of like,

527
00:24:32,587 --> 00:24:34,428
take it all in and interpret without comment.

528
00:24:35,163 --> 00:24:37,244
But with Uncharted, places are much more ancient,

529
00:24:37,244 --> 00:24:39,525
so we depend on our characters to comment on it,

530
00:24:39,525 --> 00:24:42,386
to understand the understanding of the story.

531
00:24:42,386 --> 00:24:43,987
We do that through other techniques,

532
00:24:43,987 --> 00:24:46,208
especially level dialogue, as you saw a little bit earlier.

533
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:48,789
So to recap, when writing for our open world level,

534
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:51,691
we approached it the same way we would any other level,

535
00:24:51,691 --> 00:24:54,472
then adjusted our tools, level dialogue in particular,

536
00:24:54,472 --> 00:24:56,193
to allow for player choice.

537
00:24:56,193 --> 00:24:58,474
Now, I know this has been kind of an orderly,

538
00:24:58,474 --> 00:25:00,815
some might say linear way to explain it,

539
00:25:00,815 --> 00:25:02,836
but in actuality, production isn't linear.

540
00:25:03,151 --> 00:25:04,812
We didn't figure all that stuff out in order.

541
00:25:04,812 --> 00:25:06,633
Our process looks a little bit more like this.

542
00:25:06,633 --> 00:25:10,275
And that's okay, because we start with a strong story outline,

543
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:13,537
and then through the organic process of collaborating with design,

544
00:25:13,537 --> 00:25:16,039
we flesh out the details and the implementation.

545
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:19,241
We try things out, we take chances, and sometimes you have setbacks.

546
00:25:19,241 --> 00:25:22,282
And then you rally and come up with better ideas and get back on track.

547
00:25:22,282 --> 00:25:25,364
In a way, we were kind of doing open-world design,

548
00:25:25,364 --> 00:25:27,986
just in our design process and not in the game itself up until now.

549
00:25:29,447 --> 00:25:31,548
But our open design process comes with a cost.

550
00:25:31,548 --> 00:25:34,469
We originally scheduled for a game with four hours of content.

551
00:25:34,469 --> 00:25:36,850
And what we shipped, for various and sundry reasons,

552
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:38,111
ended up being about double that.

553
00:25:38,111 --> 00:25:42,873
And this obviously threw things into disarray.

554
00:25:42,873 --> 00:25:45,394
So for starters, this list evolved and changed a lot,

555
00:25:45,394 --> 00:25:48,115
particularly which bits ended up we included in the cut scenes.

556
00:25:48,115 --> 00:25:50,776
And this is no different than our usual process.

557
00:25:50,776 --> 00:25:52,917
But in an open world section where

558
00:25:52,917 --> 00:25:55,239
had this many moving parts, it led to a lot of hurry up

559
00:25:55,239 --> 00:25:56,779
and wait when it came to the recording

560
00:25:56,779 --> 00:25:57,700
and the implementation.

561
00:25:58,718 --> 00:26:01,499
And on that subject, we also found ourselves in a situation

562
00:26:01,499 --> 00:26:02,680
with no really good options.

563
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,500
Our short schedule meant that we'd only have time

564
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:08,541
for one series of sessions in the recording booth,

565
00:26:08,541 --> 00:26:10,642
with very little time for pickups.

566
00:26:10,642 --> 00:26:13,263
And we didn't have time to do tests in game beforehand

567
00:26:13,263 --> 00:26:16,244
to properly assess what bits we actually needed.

568
00:26:16,244 --> 00:26:18,844
So to cover our asses, we wrote way more

569
00:26:18,844 --> 00:26:21,385
than we ended up using, because if something didn't get in

570
00:26:21,385 --> 00:26:23,386
on that first pass, it might not get in the game at all.

571
00:26:23,386 --> 00:26:26,567
And this, of course, made a tight recording schedule

572
00:26:26,567 --> 00:26:27,667
even tighter.

573
00:26:27,667 --> 00:26:28,007
Whoops.

574
00:26:28,623 --> 00:26:31,786
So if a conversation ended up not fitting into an intended space,

575
00:26:31,786 --> 00:26:33,807
we either trim it or we cut it entirely.

576
00:26:33,807 --> 00:26:37,150
And last, we didn't use any special software

577
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:38,271
to track all these variations.

578
00:26:38,271 --> 00:26:41,534
Lots of that information was either in the script

579
00:26:41,534 --> 00:26:43,556
or in my head, meaning that you had

580
00:26:43,556 --> 00:26:44,997
to know where to look in the script

581
00:26:44,997 --> 00:26:48,260
or know where I was hiding, usually under my desk.

582
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,862
So lessons learned.

583
00:26:50,862 --> 00:26:54,265
This whole open world business is really freaking difficult.

584
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:56,748
And obviously Naughty Dog is a little bit late to that party,

585
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:59,390
but we have newfound appreciation for teams

586
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:02,152
who execute open-world games and games with branching narratives.

587
00:27:02,152 --> 00:27:04,875
But should we ever do anything like this again,

588
00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:06,736
we do have some takeaway lessons from the experience.

589
00:27:06,736 --> 00:27:09,979
We'll know to tie our character progression to the key goals

590
00:27:09,979 --> 00:27:12,381
because that grants us a greater degree of narrative control.

591
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:14,703
We'll plan to put key character beats in the areas

592
00:27:14,703 --> 00:27:17,465
that the players guarantee to see.

593
00:27:17,465 --> 00:27:20,187
And if you can't tie progression into the specific events

594
00:27:20,187 --> 00:27:22,069
in a known order, we need to build on it

595
00:27:22,069 --> 00:27:23,450
and track it with the level dialogue.

596
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:26,340
And then we'll leverage what we learned swapping lines in

597
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,700
for the neutral dialogue to create a continuous flow

598
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,260
for the character development.

599
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:32,441
And to avoid the whole recording cluster fudge,

600
00:27:32,441 --> 00:27:35,642
one thing that we're already doing on The Last of Us 2

601
00:27:35,642 --> 00:27:37,462
is writing temp dialogue for the levels

602
00:27:37,462 --> 00:27:39,443
way earlier than we ever have before.

603
00:27:39,443 --> 00:27:42,083
So even though things are gonna likely shift or change,

604
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:43,444
we have a better sense of what we need

605
00:27:43,444 --> 00:27:44,604
in advance of recording.

606
00:27:44,604 --> 00:27:46,564
The hope being is that next time

607
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:48,125
it'll feel a little bit more like this

608
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:50,165
and a little bit less like this.

609
00:27:51,815 --> 00:27:53,096
Our goal with the Western Goths chapter

610
00:27:53,096 --> 00:27:54,597
was to make this open world environment

611
00:27:54,597 --> 00:27:57,060
while maintaining a consistent logical progression

612
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,301
to Clodine's relationship,

613
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:00,663
no matter how the player approached the level.

614
00:28:00,663 --> 00:28:01,884
And to do all this without making it

615
00:28:01,884 --> 00:28:02,925
a mad dash to the finish.

616
00:28:02,925 --> 00:28:04,306
We got it half right.

617
00:28:04,306 --> 00:28:05,427
We have to do it better next time.

618
00:28:05,427 --> 00:28:07,650
To state the obvious,

619
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:09,151
writing is just one aspect of the writing,

620
00:28:09,151 --> 00:28:10,632
of making the characters.

621
00:28:10,632 --> 00:28:12,334
We couldn't have done it without all of our

622
00:28:12,334 --> 00:28:14,136
character designers and sculptors,

623
00:28:14,136 --> 00:28:16,378
but a special shout out goes to our audio team

624
00:28:16,378 --> 00:28:17,759
and the audio scripters in particular.

625
00:28:18,095 --> 00:28:22,316
There were a lot of branches and such to track and a lot of dialogue to implement,

626
00:28:22,316 --> 00:28:25,657
and it never would have come together without their efforts.

627
00:28:25,657 --> 00:28:30,178
And obviously, you know, much thanks to Claudia Black and Laura Bailey's awesome performances,

628
00:28:30,178 --> 00:28:33,599
none of it would have mattered because they bonded early and they knocked it out of the park.

629
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:39,060
My one regret with them is that they were often doing Valley Girl versions of their line reads in the recording booth,

630
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:44,661
and if we had had time, we totally would have made it an unlockable language option.

631
00:28:44,661 --> 00:28:46,422
But maybe next time.

632
00:28:46,422 --> 00:28:46,562
So...

633
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:50,013
Like I said, I couldn't cover everything, so if you're interested in more of our process,

634
00:28:50,013 --> 00:28:52,936
I'll be doing the breakout session after this, or you can ping me on Twitter.

635
00:28:52,936 --> 00:28:57,120
But also, Neil Druckmann and Bruce Straley a while back gave a talk about Uncharted 2.

636
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,983
It's eight years old, but follows a lot of the same principles.

637
00:29:00,983 --> 00:29:04,667
Ryan James, our editor on Lost Legacy, gave a good talk, and they're both on YouTube for free.

638
00:29:04,667 --> 00:29:06,609
And that's all I got. Thank you for coming.
