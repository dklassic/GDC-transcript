1
00:00:06,292 --> 00:00:07,393
All right, hello.

2
00:00:07,413 --> 00:00:09,754
A couple quick reminders.

3
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:12,115
One, please turn off your cell phones.

4
00:00:13,195 --> 00:00:15,276
Two, don't forget to fill out your survey

5
00:00:15,816 --> 00:00:16,517
if you like the talk.

6
00:00:17,857 --> 00:00:18,838
If you don't like it, don't fill it out.

7
00:00:19,558 --> 00:00:20,979
Just kidding, fill it out either way.

8
00:00:21,919 --> 00:00:24,300
And three, I would like to acknowledge

9
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,962
that we are currently being in San Francisco Bay Area.

10
00:00:28,002 --> 00:00:30,523
We're occupying indigenous Ohlone land.

11
00:00:31,403 --> 00:00:31,863
Just a quick.

12
00:00:32,964 --> 00:00:33,864
something to be aware of.

13
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:36,465
And then before we get started, a quick note.

14
00:00:39,967 --> 00:00:41,647
It's a perilous time that we live in right now

15
00:00:41,687 --> 00:00:42,508
in the United States.

16
00:00:43,848 --> 00:00:47,550
Fascism is creeping in and the Muslim travel ban

17
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,311
as well as the proposed border wall

18
00:00:50,391 --> 00:00:51,951
I think are xenophobic bullshit.

19
00:00:52,631 --> 00:00:54,792
And I just wanna take a second to appreciate

20
00:00:54,812 --> 00:00:55,973
what a privilege it is for all of us

21
00:00:56,053 --> 00:00:57,493
to be able to come to this conference

22
00:00:57,553 --> 00:00:59,234
and to talk about games and to think about this.

23
00:00:59,674 --> 00:01:03,819
There's a lot of developers who perhaps don't feel safe coming to this country and for very good reason.

24
00:01:03,839 --> 00:01:08,705
And it upsets me that the current climate in this country and institutionalized racism

25
00:01:08,805 --> 00:01:13,291
is discriminating against fellow game developers from being here, as well as fellow human beings.

26
00:01:14,644 --> 00:01:19,930
Uh, with that being said, hi. This is Level Flow for a video game mixtape. I am Akuma.

27
00:01:20,011 --> 00:01:26,438
There's my couple social media handles. Um, I also have a hashtag if you want to live

28
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:30,343
tweet any of this you can use hashtag GDC mixtape. Um,

29
00:01:31,098 --> 00:01:33,460
you can see there I made a game called Freakin' Weekend,

30
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,701
or I'm finishing up at the moment.

31
00:01:35,501 --> 00:01:37,342
We showed it at IndieCade last year,

32
00:01:37,362 --> 00:01:39,984
and I'll talk more about that

33
00:01:40,484 --> 00:01:43,086
and how it works with video game mixtapes shortly.

34
00:01:43,226 --> 00:01:44,787
Quick couple notes about myself.

35
00:01:45,961 --> 00:01:47,722
I'm from Los Angeles, I'm an LA native.

36
00:01:48,622 --> 00:01:51,523
I'm part of a collection, a group of,

37
00:01:51,964 --> 00:01:54,325
a community of indie game developers called QuidgeCity,

38
00:01:54,345 --> 00:01:56,226
and I've been making games for about

39
00:01:56,306 --> 00:01:57,306
three and a half years now.

40
00:01:57,746 --> 00:01:59,647
And I'm also alumni of USC,

41
00:01:59,667 --> 00:02:01,128
the University of Southern California,

42
00:02:01,248 --> 00:02:03,089
specifically the School of Cinematic Arts,

43
00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:07,370
their Interactive Media and Games MFA graduate program.

44
00:02:08,411 --> 00:02:10,632
So, hopefully a lot of you saw the title,

45
00:02:10,652 --> 00:02:12,633
Video Game Mixtape, and were kind of intrigued by that.

46
00:02:12,713 --> 00:02:15,174
So we wonder, what is a video game mixtape?

47
00:02:16,045 --> 00:02:20,071
And perhaps one day we'll have a vocabulary that doesn't rely on antiquated media.

48
00:02:21,093 --> 00:02:22,293
to talk about games and what we're doing,

49
00:02:22,313 --> 00:02:23,873
but for now it's fun to explore that.

50
00:02:24,393 --> 00:02:25,854
So I would say that a video game mixtape

51
00:02:26,074 --> 00:02:28,634
is an intentional collection of mini-games,

52
00:02:29,134 --> 00:02:30,795
and the sum is greater than its parts.

53
00:02:31,695 --> 00:02:33,535
I have mini-games in quotation marks

54
00:02:33,555 --> 00:02:34,956
because I feel like the term mini-game

55
00:02:35,036 --> 00:02:36,496
is a little problematic.

56
00:02:36,596 --> 00:02:38,316
Mini is inherently inferior,

57
00:02:38,516 --> 00:02:40,197
and it reinforces this capitalist idea

58
00:02:40,237 --> 00:02:42,737
that the value of a game is related to its length.

59
00:02:43,537 --> 00:02:44,937
I do like the term vignette games,

60
00:02:45,158 --> 00:02:46,218
but video game mixtapes

61
00:02:46,238 --> 00:02:47,718
aren't necessarily made of all vignettes,

62
00:02:47,818 --> 00:02:49,498
so for now we'll just stick with mini-games.

63
00:02:51,227 --> 00:02:52,330
So here's our track listing.

64
00:02:53,754 --> 00:02:55,238
You can see we got through the intro,

65
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,525
we're going currently through what is a video game mixtape,

66
00:02:57,585 --> 00:02:58,668
and I have a couple other tracks.

67
00:02:59,774 --> 00:03:02,076
here, so we got some good stuff for you.

68
00:03:02,096 --> 00:03:05,279
And before we go deeper, let's perhaps take a step back

69
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,680
and think what is a mix tape?

70
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:09,703
I think most of you here are old enough to have experience

71
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:12,225
whether it's on a cassette tape form or a CD,

72
00:03:12,285 --> 00:03:13,546
some form of mix tape.

73
00:03:13,566 --> 00:03:15,588
But basically you would record your favorite songs

74
00:03:15,688 --> 00:03:17,210
onto a tape or a CD.

75
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:20,012
Perhaps you record them off the radio

76
00:03:20,092 --> 00:03:21,814
or from another tape or from a computer.

77
00:03:23,097 --> 00:03:25,578
But it took a while to make this physical media,

78
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:26,918
so you put a lot of thought into it.

79
00:03:27,798 --> 00:03:29,699
And though I do want to see games that bring together

80
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:31,720
works from a bunch of different authors,

81
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,920
I think that'd be kind of hard because every code,

82
00:03:34,101 --> 00:03:35,341
the code that everyone used to make games,

83
00:03:35,401 --> 00:03:36,021
it's all separate.

84
00:03:36,461 --> 00:03:38,102
So compiling that would be very difficult.

85
00:03:38,622 --> 00:03:39,843
And besides, I'm a little bit more interested

86
00:03:39,863 --> 00:03:41,983
in looking at the modern hip hop mixtape.

87
00:03:43,124 --> 00:03:45,485
So here's a few hip hop mixtapes.

88
00:03:46,598 --> 00:03:48,340
from the last couple years.

89
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,141
And hip-hop mixtape, typically you have a rapper

90
00:03:51,241 --> 00:03:53,223
who's rapping on every track,

91
00:03:53,263 --> 00:03:56,225
and they have guest producers, they have featured artists,

92
00:03:56,245 --> 00:03:58,686
they have other musicians in,

93
00:03:58,866 --> 00:04:00,187
and these guys are recording,

94
00:04:00,567 --> 00:04:03,489
and women, they're recording dozens of songs,

95
00:04:03,589 --> 00:04:06,071
so you can put together a mixtape to show off your skills,

96
00:04:06,151 --> 00:04:08,252
to build up hype for your commercial album

97
00:04:08,292 --> 00:04:09,553
that you're gonna release,

98
00:04:10,153 --> 00:04:11,574
and really to show off your practice,

99
00:04:11,674 --> 00:04:13,395
and your hustle, and your progress.

100
00:04:13,415 --> 00:04:14,476
And I think that's a really cool

101
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,582
model to look at when we think about games.

102
00:04:19,642 --> 00:04:21,804
So how could we adapt this format?

103
00:04:23,245 --> 00:04:24,566
Well, thankfully it falls in line with,

104
00:04:24,687 --> 00:04:26,368
I don't know if you've seen this Ira Glass,

105
00:04:26,408 --> 00:04:30,511
he's a DJ with NPR,

106
00:04:31,392 --> 00:04:33,694
and he talks about, you know,

107
00:04:33,714 --> 00:04:36,096
we have this skills gap where we have taste,

108
00:04:36,136 --> 00:04:38,698
good taste in games, as I'm sure a lot of you here have,

109
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:40,460
but the things that we make when we start,

110
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,382
they're not quite as good as what we like to think of.

111
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:49,312
So he advocates making a high volume of work in order to close that gap.

112
00:04:50,162 --> 00:04:51,603
And it also falls in line with what,

113
00:04:51,823 --> 00:04:53,783
this is Adriel and Rami, two people I met

114
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:56,644
my first year at USC, and they were talking about

115
00:04:56,664 --> 00:04:58,684
doing a game a week, so this idea that you make

116
00:04:58,784 --> 00:05:00,965
one game per week, and at the end of the week,

117
00:05:01,025 --> 00:05:03,666
you toss out, or not toss out, but you just

118
00:05:04,186 --> 00:05:06,306
competently abandon what it is that you made,

119
00:05:06,386 --> 00:05:08,087
but it's just, you're rapidly making things

120
00:05:08,127 --> 00:05:09,187
going through this process.

121
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,648
You know, think of the idea, prototype it,

122
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,309
test it, make it, refine it, repeat.

123
00:05:15,369 --> 00:05:16,309
And I think that that's, you know,

124
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,270
really falls in line with this idea of

125
00:05:19,293 --> 00:05:23,717
video game mixtapes. So that's what I did. I had to make a game while I was at USC for

126
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:28,121
my thesis. I had a year to put together a project. So instead of making one, I decided

127
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:31,745
I'm going to make dozens. I'm just going to make a bunch of little things and allow that

128
00:05:31,805 --> 00:05:36,369
to build up my process. And then you can see I tied it together in this mobile phone interface

129
00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:38,451
and all these little icons represent the different apps.

130
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:41,712
And in some ways too, this is my rapper struggle album.

131
00:05:42,213 --> 00:05:44,673
You know, just very much struggling financially,

132
00:05:45,254 --> 00:05:47,094
going through school, being a long distance relationship.

133
00:05:47,114 --> 00:05:48,955
A lot of things were going on at that time in my life.

134
00:05:49,075 --> 00:05:52,356
So, you know, this is sort of therapy in form of art.

135
00:05:52,956 --> 00:05:54,197
So, you know, making a lot of things.

136
00:05:54,237 --> 00:05:56,677
And I perhaps took that a little bit too much to heart.

137
00:05:56,697 --> 00:05:59,238
Here's my Unity project folder where there's just tons

138
00:05:59,278 --> 00:06:01,279
and tons of projects and actually counted recently.

139
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:04,160
And in the last year outside of freaking weekend,

140
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:04,680
which is my,

141
00:06:06,172 --> 00:06:08,313
my thesis, I've made like 20 other game projects,

142
00:06:08,353 --> 00:06:09,753
or 28 depending on how you cut them,

143
00:06:09,793 --> 00:06:10,954
which is like crazy to me.

144
00:06:11,134 --> 00:06:12,495
And not all of them have been released,

145
00:06:12,535 --> 00:06:14,616
a lot of them are just kind of like really solid prototypes,

146
00:06:14,716 --> 00:06:18,938
but again, it just speaks to this method of practice

147
00:06:19,318 --> 00:06:20,239
to improve our skills.

148
00:06:21,099 --> 00:06:22,200
But a couple notes,

149
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,681
if you are gonna make a video game mixtape,

150
00:06:23,801 --> 00:06:25,041
you would want, rather than this,

151
00:06:25,081 --> 00:06:27,603
to have all of your games inside of one project folder.

152
00:06:28,768 --> 00:06:32,433
Um, and make sure your naming schemes are tight because a lot of times I just rely on typing to

153
00:06:32,473 --> 00:06:37,280
search for the files that I want. As well as, um, don't fear short game experiences, especially

154
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:42,747
when you're making a mix. Uh, this is Joey Ramone from the punk band The Ramones. Um,

155
00:06:43,702 --> 00:06:46,363
And a lot of punk rock songs can be very short,

156
00:06:46,503 --> 00:06:49,644
but we don't really call them mini songs, right?

157
00:06:51,005 --> 00:06:52,266
They're just songs, it's just music.

158
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:54,367
And there's a nice quote that I like

159
00:06:54,427 --> 00:06:55,988
where someone asked Joey Ramone

160
00:06:56,008 --> 00:06:58,789
about why the Ramone songs are all so fast,

161
00:06:58,829 --> 00:07:00,930
and he said, or why they're all so short.

162
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,311
And he said, we actually play very long songs,

163
00:07:03,391 --> 00:07:04,752
but we just play them very fast.

164
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:07,773
So I love it, I love that he flips it.

165
00:07:07,813 --> 00:07:10,175
It's all relative anyways, what does it matter?

166
00:07:10,235 --> 00:07:11,495
We should just make what we wanna make.

167
00:07:12,705 --> 00:07:15,589
uh... this is the freaking weekend inspirations mix time you might

168
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:17,430
recognize some of these games are not going to go into

169
00:07:17,891 --> 00:07:21,715
all of them but a lot of these games have the sort of uh... mix feel to it or

170
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:21,975
they

171
00:07:21,995 --> 00:07:25,899
uh... variety of gameplay or in the gameplay a lot of times is really

172
00:07:25,939 --> 00:07:27,701
relaxed as well so it's not like you

173
00:07:28,002 --> 00:07:32,065
run the risk of losing or failing or not getting it as you play, you're going to get through

174
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:36,348
a lot of these experiences or they do something interesting with music or sound.

175
00:07:37,109 --> 00:07:41,752
And for me, I realized that a lot of these influence my style to not just make experimental

176
00:07:41,792 --> 00:07:43,554
work but things that are experiential.

177
00:07:44,174 --> 00:07:46,415
So it's about the metaphor of what it is that you're doing,

178
00:07:47,035 --> 00:07:50,096
but we want to use simple and fun mechanics to do that.

179
00:07:50,176 --> 00:07:51,676
So we're gonna use the language of gameplay.

180
00:07:51,696 --> 00:07:54,157
We're gonna use the language of feedback and juiciness

181
00:07:54,257 --> 00:07:55,978
and teaching our player different things

182
00:07:56,018 --> 00:07:58,458
in order to have them do these kind of metaphors.

183
00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:01,079
And then the secret for video game mixtape

184
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:02,500
is before the player gets bored,

185
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,080
or normally when the difficulty would increase,

186
00:08:05,501 --> 00:08:06,621
we just move on to the next game.

187
00:08:08,281 --> 00:08:09,102
And that was side A.

188
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:10,742
Here we're gonna flip over the tape.

189
00:08:14,032 --> 00:08:17,377
And move on to the B side, where we got Freakin' Weekend,

190
00:08:17,957 --> 00:08:19,439
Lumpo, and Spooky Game Snacks.

191
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,742
Some other examples that we can look at.

192
00:08:22,363 --> 00:08:23,985
Here's our updated track listing.

193
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:25,887
And actually, there's a typo.

194
00:08:25,927 --> 00:08:27,549
Six and eight should be flipped.

195
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:29,692
But never mind that.

196
00:08:31,026 --> 00:08:32,827
But yeah, Freakin' Weekend, I mentioned earlier.

197
00:08:33,227 --> 00:08:36,549
This is my video game mixtape, my most personal one.

198
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:39,171
You can see it's in a mobile phone interface

199
00:08:39,211 --> 00:08:40,532
and when people play it, it's like you're going

200
00:08:40,572 --> 00:08:43,834
through someone's phone or perhaps you're performing as me.

201
00:08:43,934 --> 00:08:45,816
So they're a little bit intentionally vague

202
00:08:45,876 --> 00:08:48,537
as to who the player is when they're playing this

203
00:08:48,597 --> 00:08:51,519
but it's very much using the affordances of the phone.

204
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:55,102
I wanna look at first a couple of micro examples

205
00:08:55,142 --> 00:08:56,523
of level design of what I made

206
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:58,184
and then we'll look at the macro

207
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,244
of how they all fit together.

208
00:09:00,549 --> 00:09:02,491
So here's an example, I'm sure a lot of you have,

209
00:09:03,271 --> 00:09:04,933
you know, relate to coding and making games,

210
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,254
using Unity perhaps.

211
00:09:07,034 --> 00:09:10,217
So this game I just sort of copied my setup from home,

212
00:09:10,857 --> 00:09:11,778
and you know, you can type on,

213
00:09:11,798 --> 00:09:13,159
if you look at the bottom phone,

214
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:15,041
you can see you just typing on the keyboard

215
00:09:15,081 --> 00:09:16,161
and the text shows up.

216
00:09:16,221 --> 00:09:18,984
So very much just about, you know, the joy of typing,

217
00:09:19,004 --> 00:09:22,006
if you can get into typing code.

218
00:09:22,046 --> 00:09:24,108
But you know, you can't type anything wrong,

219
00:09:24,128 --> 00:09:26,750
you just type this, text shows up,

220
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,611
and then you can move on to the next.

221
00:09:29,552 --> 00:09:33,334
level to ask if you want to save it and then you can move from there.

222
00:09:33,514 --> 00:09:37,216
And a lot of these games that I made is just reflecting on my life, thinking if this was

223
00:09:37,256 --> 00:09:39,237
a game, what would the mechanics be?

224
00:09:39,277 --> 00:09:40,357
What would the player be doing?

225
00:09:40,397 --> 00:09:44,179
What type of emotion would I want to tell doing this?

226
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,680
I made another game about...

227
00:09:47,572 --> 00:09:51,534
meditation. I went to this Buddhist meditation retreat a couple years back and it had a pretty

228
00:09:51,574 --> 00:09:55,636
big impact on me, talking about mindfulness and breathing. If you time your breathing to that

229
00:09:55,716 --> 00:10:01,619
GIF up the top, if you feel anxious or whatever, it can help you to just relax. So I thought,

230
00:10:01,659 --> 00:10:02,899
how can we turn that into...

231
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,880
a game and gameplay mechanics.

232
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,960
So we thought of this idea where you're touching the screen

233
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,101
and you're growing the circle,

234
00:10:08,201 --> 00:10:10,721
sort of similar to what the shape is doing.

235
00:10:11,101 --> 00:10:12,702
And then we put some mantras of people,

236
00:10:12,742 --> 00:10:14,502
what they meditate, could meditate to,

237
00:10:14,582 --> 00:10:16,002
thinking about in the back of your head,

238
00:10:16,723 --> 00:10:20,864
as well as some fun visuals to really show,

239
00:10:21,224 --> 00:10:25,105
to convey and teach this mindfulness breathing mechanic,

240
00:10:25,165 --> 00:10:26,625
if you will, but the player is actually doing

241
00:10:26,645 --> 00:10:28,345
the physical breathing while they're touching the screen.

242
00:10:30,023 --> 00:10:35,457
I made a Gamergate game about Twitter, what it's like to have a Twitter hate mob descending

243
00:10:35,537 --> 00:10:38,465
on you, because when I was working on this project, that was definitely...

244
00:10:39,165 --> 00:10:45,067
Hap going on, I haven't, so in this game you can swipe to move the camera and when you

245
00:10:45,087 --> 00:10:48,629
look at these little anime and game avatars they like cuss at you and say really mean

246
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:49,249
things to you.

247
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,552
And I wanted to create this sort of audio assault for the players, so as they clear

248
00:10:54,572 --> 00:10:57,633
a certain number of them, or as they clear them more show up, and as they clear a certain

249
00:10:57,653 --> 00:11:00,715
number of them I have different things that trigger, different audio things to make the

250
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:03,496
player feel paranoid, different things that I do to the environment.

251
00:11:03,836 --> 00:11:05,657
to really ramp up that tension.

252
00:11:05,677 --> 00:11:08,219
And I thankfully have not been the subject

253
00:11:08,259 --> 00:11:09,960
of a Twitter hate mob, but back in the day,

254
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,561
I wrote a blog about this game

255
00:11:12,601 --> 00:11:14,823
that had sort of racist imagery in it,

256
00:11:15,043 --> 00:11:17,124
and a bunch of people descended on the comments

257
00:11:17,184 --> 00:11:18,945
and said pretty awful things.

258
00:11:18,985 --> 00:11:20,787
One of my favorites was someone saying,

259
00:11:21,087 --> 00:11:23,388
fuck, Alejandro Cuadra, that's my legal name,

260
00:11:23,408 --> 00:11:24,769
but this is from PSPGamers619.

261
00:11:26,662 --> 00:11:29,744
And I think it's funny because it's 619 and not 69, like, I don't know.

262
00:11:30,245 --> 00:11:33,107
I think it's funny now to look back at it, but at the time, too, it didn't feel good,

263
00:11:33,127 --> 00:11:35,829
it felt pretty awful, because I was like, oh, my career is ruined, I can never work

264
00:11:35,849 --> 00:11:39,192
in the games industry again, but obviously that's not true.

265
00:11:39,712 --> 00:11:43,916
But you know, how do we express that feeling, how do we convey that to a player in gameplay?

266
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:49,344
A couple other examples is I have a game where you're rolling a joint and you're breaking

267
00:11:49,404 --> 00:11:50,925
up weed and you blow it out the window.

268
00:11:50,945 --> 00:11:53,847
And if you live at home with your mom, that's what you do when you don't want her to smell

269
00:11:53,867 --> 00:11:55,969
it is you blow the smoke out the window.

270
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,330
So I wanted to put that in a game.

271
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:58,611
I have another one at the bottom.

272
00:11:58,631 --> 00:12:03,535
You can see you're rotating this phone and as you rotate it, it's like a kaleidoscope

273
00:12:03,575 --> 00:12:04,896
and the different shapes move.

274
00:12:05,076 --> 00:12:05,517
That's my 94 Civic.

275
00:12:06,978 --> 00:12:10,800
in there and you can tap on the diamonds, tacos will show up at some point.

276
00:12:11,461 --> 00:12:15,523
It's a music toy, so as you rotate it, different notes will play and the beat's playing.

277
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:20,186
So it's really much just, you know, like a music video almost.

278
00:12:20,826 --> 00:12:24,728
And it's a way that I could also make an homage to driving without actually building a driving

279
00:12:24,808 --> 00:12:27,810
engine and having a whole driving game, because that's way too much work.

280
00:12:29,028 --> 00:12:33,772
As well as I have here messages, a lot of these are actually from my phone at the time

281
00:12:33,792 --> 00:12:37,334
when I made this, like what were the latest responses and messages I had with my friends

282
00:12:37,374 --> 00:12:38,215
and I put those in there.

283
00:12:38,575 --> 00:12:42,318
But it's done to do world building because people might read those snippets and be like

284
00:12:42,358 --> 00:12:43,599
oh I wonder what that was about.

285
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:47,261
So it creates this whole sense of world even though I don't go through like explaining

286
00:12:47,341 --> 00:12:51,444
or resolving some of those things, it's just to kind of make everything feel a little bit

287
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:52,305
more believable.

288
00:12:52,945 --> 00:12:54,306
As well as I can put in different...

289
00:12:55,387 --> 00:12:59,231
ARG or different mini games where you're messaging people

290
00:12:59,251 --> 00:13:00,693
back and forth and different story elements

291
00:13:00,753 --> 00:13:02,334
we can reveal that way.

292
00:13:02,475 --> 00:13:04,336
And I also have the little star button at the bottom

293
00:13:04,356 --> 00:13:05,778
and that's how you can navigate back

294
00:13:05,898 --> 00:13:07,099
to the level select screen.

295
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,961
So some of the games they kind of channel you through

296
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:11,163
and some of them you can press it

297
00:13:11,203 --> 00:13:12,344
and it'll knock you back to here.

298
00:13:12,364 --> 00:13:14,426
This is my level select screen.

299
00:13:14,847 --> 00:13:16,148
All right, so we made this example

300
00:13:16,188 --> 00:13:18,350
but I made a bunch of pieces, now what do we do with them?

301
00:13:19,527 --> 00:13:23,648
This is Sergei Eisenstein, who is a Soviet filmmaker and film theorist.

302
00:13:24,728 --> 00:13:28,169
So you talk about this thing called montage, and there's other names for it now,

303
00:13:28,229 --> 00:13:30,129
or people think of montage as being something different,

304
00:13:30,169 --> 00:13:34,610
but the idea is that the order that people see different images in film

305
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,591
will affect how they interpret it.

306
00:13:36,711 --> 00:13:40,932
The preceding image will influence what they think of the next one, etc.

307
00:13:40,992 --> 00:13:43,072
So we can use that to our advantage.

308
00:13:43,892 --> 00:13:45,233
Humans, like, we love stories.

309
00:13:45,593 --> 00:13:47,413
We love hearing stories, we love telling stories,

310
00:13:47,453 --> 00:13:49,253
we love thinking stories and figuring things out.

311
00:13:50,514 --> 00:13:52,615
And that's great because then we can just put out

312
00:13:52,655 --> 00:13:54,877
these different elements and the player,

313
00:13:54,957 --> 00:13:55,817
when they play through them,

314
00:13:55,857 --> 00:13:56,738
they're gonna start to figure out,

315
00:13:56,778 --> 00:13:58,179
okay, what's the story, what's going on here?

316
00:13:58,199 --> 00:14:00,500
So we don't have to be explicit about it as designers.

317
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,141
We can have it be intentionally vague

318
00:14:02,461 --> 00:14:04,663
and still have a general idea of what we want it to be,

319
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:06,364
but we don't have to be explicit with it.

320
00:14:06,464 --> 00:14:08,445
So it's great because it gives you a lot of freedom.

321
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:10,526
But yeah, montage.

322
00:14:11,574 --> 00:14:16,197
So we can take like the uh coding game here and in the game after you test the game, the

323
00:14:16,217 --> 00:14:20,881
phone pops up and you look at it and it knocks you or now you're playing the game or you're

324
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:25,765
testing the one that you are supposedly working on. Um and you can see this one's you

325
00:14:25,785 --> 00:14:29,788
know sort of modeled after uh Space Harrier and Star Fox and some of these other games.

326
00:14:31,274 --> 00:14:33,455
And this one, so if you look at the action beats,

327
00:14:33,695 --> 00:14:35,836
the typing one's kind of fun, but it's kind of a lull too

328
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:37,897
because you're just kind of exploring this little space.

329
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:39,417
And then this other game where you're flying,

330
00:14:39,437 --> 00:14:40,838
there's a really nice song that plays

331
00:14:40,878 --> 00:14:42,698
and there's all this sort of more action

332
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:44,659
and it's intentionally a little bit more gamey

333
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:46,560
in that there's like a combo meter and like money,

334
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,260
but at the end there's a surprise twist

335
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,241
where I flip it on its head.

336
00:14:49,921 --> 00:14:52,082
So we have this fun transition

337
00:14:52,102 --> 00:14:53,702
and now we have a little bit more action going on.

338
00:14:53,962 --> 00:14:56,143
So how do we move from this to another game?

339
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:58,024
Well, since we're using a mobile phone,

340
00:14:58,044 --> 00:14:59,344
what I do is I have a little.

341
00:15:00,545 --> 00:15:04,389
notification pop down to tell you that, oh, people responded to your message on the

342
00:15:04,449 --> 00:15:08,334
Twitter or as I call it, Critter app. It's like creepy Twitter, so it's Critter as

343
00:15:08,394 --> 00:15:13,279
opposed to Twitter. But, um, let you know that that's been updated. So when you tap

344
00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:18,305
on that, um, banner, it then opens up the Twitter app. And then now we go from

345
00:15:18,365 --> 00:15:19,366
having, you know, a higher, um,

346
00:15:21,132 --> 00:15:24,374
state of tension a little bit to now we ramp it up dramatically so the player's

347
00:15:24,534 --> 00:15:26,635
now getting really intense. I've had people say how

348
00:15:27,055 --> 00:15:30,216
affecting playing this was because you're just hearing all this

349
00:15:30,677 --> 00:15:34,538
negative things being said to you and even though it's not like personalized

350
00:15:34,598 --> 00:15:35,939
explicitly towards each player

351
00:15:36,259 --> 00:15:38,440
there's still that feeling where people internalize it.

352
00:15:39,781 --> 00:15:43,224
So it's like, oh, okay, now I have the player in this sort of heightened state.

353
00:15:43,304 --> 00:15:44,105
What do we do with that?

354
00:15:44,145 --> 00:15:48,449
Because how do you, what do you go to next that doesn't seem kind of trivial or doesn't, isn't kind of weird?

355
00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:51,912
So it seemed obvious to then go to the meditation game afterwards.

356
00:15:52,733 --> 00:15:56,956
And I like that because it gives the player a tool that they can use to come down from...

357
00:15:58,895 --> 00:16:02,399
not just like a literal tool in the game, but also like an internal tool that they can

358
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:04,901
use to, you know, sort of recollect themselves.

359
00:16:05,241 --> 00:16:09,385
At one point I had a jump cut that took you from the Twitter game to the meditation game,

360
00:16:09,405 --> 00:16:12,669
but people found that to be very disorienting, especially when they're trying to process

361
00:16:13,089 --> 00:16:14,811
all this sort of negativity that's happening.

362
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:18,654
So instead I had another banner that pops down to tell you, oh, your meditation app

363
00:16:18,694 --> 00:16:20,716
has been updated, so now you can tap on that.

364
00:16:21,137 --> 00:16:23,737
to go or if you go back to the title screen,

365
00:16:24,077 --> 00:16:26,498
the meditation app will be available as a new icon

366
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:27,858
for you to try out when you're ready.

367
00:16:28,198 --> 00:16:30,199
So creating that space in between the apps

368
00:16:30,339 --> 00:16:32,199
was really important to give the player

369
00:16:32,219 --> 00:16:33,500
a little bit of room to process,

370
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,560
a little bit of room to breathe.

371
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,701
And then it's also like traditional game design

372
00:16:36,721 --> 00:16:39,181
where you have a really intense gameplay moment

373
00:16:39,201 --> 00:16:40,962
so you might have something where you're in a town

374
00:16:41,022 --> 00:16:43,242
or you're doing something that's much more relaxed

375
00:16:43,282 --> 00:16:45,223
to sort of balance out those more intense moments.

376
00:16:45,283 --> 00:16:46,963
It can't be intense all the time.

377
00:16:48,367 --> 00:16:52,009
So, you know, we want to take into consideration what's the emotional arc of the player.

378
00:16:52,029 --> 00:16:57,230
Another example, so we have this weed smoking, rolling a joint, light puzzle game, which

379
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:00,111
is actually like a lot of work to make this one because apparently not everyone knows

380
00:17:00,151 --> 00:17:00,852
how to roll a joint.

381
00:17:01,232 --> 00:17:02,692
Some people didn't feel comfortable doing it.

382
00:17:02,712 --> 00:17:07,654
Yeah, so I thought it was just funny, but it was a lot of little tricks I had to put

383
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,955
in here to sort of teach people how to do that.

384
00:17:10,395 --> 00:17:13,236
And after you, you know, roll it, it goes in the first person and you can look around

385
00:17:13,256 --> 00:17:13,556
the room.

386
00:17:13,596 --> 00:17:14,316
You find the phone.

387
00:17:14,336 --> 00:17:15,497
You pick up the phone.

388
00:17:16,183 --> 00:17:17,985
and it goes into the driving game.

389
00:17:18,165 --> 00:17:19,867
So, you know, now's this question,

390
00:17:19,887 --> 00:17:21,429
this is kind of a more psychedelic game,

391
00:17:21,449 --> 00:17:22,971
so is the player high right now?

392
00:17:23,051 --> 00:17:24,873
Am I high right now and you're playing as me?

393
00:17:25,855 --> 00:17:27,156
You know, it's intentionally vague,

394
00:17:27,256 --> 00:17:28,298
but you know, there is some,

395
00:17:28,478 --> 00:17:29,899
I do want you to think, you know,

396
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,903
that the weed effects carry over into the next one.

397
00:17:33,243 --> 00:17:34,885
And then midway when you're playing through this.

398
00:17:36,292 --> 00:17:38,113
you know, this psychedelic driving game,

399
00:17:39,054 --> 00:17:41,817
I decided to interrupt it with a phone call from mom.

400
00:17:41,877 --> 00:17:43,359
So then you have to talk to my mom,

401
00:17:44,239 --> 00:17:45,541
and you have, you know, little chances

402
00:17:45,721 --> 00:17:47,963
or options of what you can say to respond.

403
00:17:49,264 --> 00:17:50,285
And I thought that was kind of funny

404
00:17:50,345 --> 00:17:51,927
because like, who's gonna wanna play a game?

405
00:17:51,947 --> 00:17:52,648
Hey, you wanna play a video game

406
00:17:52,668 --> 00:17:53,829
where you talk to my mom on the phone?

407
00:17:53,869 --> 00:17:55,551
Like, that sounds really stupid, right?

408
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:58,172
are not stupid, but like, you know, you're not gonna maybe,

409
00:17:58,592 --> 00:17:59,572
only a special type of gamer

410
00:18:00,153 --> 00:18:01,533
might be initially interested in that.

411
00:18:01,633 --> 00:18:03,214
So I thought, how can we trick people

412
00:18:03,294 --> 00:18:04,895
into having this conversation?

413
00:18:05,035 --> 00:18:06,115
Well, we can bait and switch them.

414
00:18:06,135 --> 00:18:07,216
You start off with a weed game.

415
00:18:07,256 --> 00:18:08,696
Hey, that's fun, this is funny, look at me,

416
00:18:08,716 --> 00:18:09,657
I'm rolling a joint, you know?

417
00:18:09,817 --> 00:18:12,338
Oh, cool, now it's all trippy and psychedelic, oh shit.

418
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:13,758
Like, I've had people play the game

419
00:18:13,778 --> 00:18:16,399
and then hand me the phone when it looks like it's ringing

420
00:18:16,419 --> 00:18:17,860
because they thought that someone was calling me.

421
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,420
But it's like, I don't know,

422
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,621
that's part of the game, keep playing.

423
00:18:20,101 --> 00:18:22,282
You know, so you kind of trick them into doing this.

424
00:18:22,322 --> 00:18:23,462
And then most people then would say,

425
00:18:23,482 --> 00:18:24,563
oh, well it's really like kind of.

426
00:18:25,303 --> 00:18:28,564
boring, but not boring in a bad way, but in the way that it actually does feel when you

427
00:18:28,584 --> 00:18:31,345
talk to your parents and they're telling you all these things and you're just trying to

428
00:18:31,545 --> 00:18:32,786
move the conversation along.

429
00:18:32,806 --> 00:18:36,747
So that was like a fun way to transition between those.

430
00:18:37,228 --> 00:18:39,889
And then a secret slide here, the work in progress.

431
00:18:41,769 --> 00:18:45,531
So I have a video chat one that's more just about the frustrations of video chat.

432
00:18:47,538 --> 00:18:48,519
So you can see that as one.

433
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:52,121
Number two is sort of this sex dream that I had,

434
00:18:52,441 --> 00:18:53,422
or that I wanted to make,

435
00:18:53,442 --> 00:18:54,623
or actually it was like a sex scene,

436
00:18:54,643 --> 00:18:56,064
but I wanted it to be about consensual sex.

437
00:18:56,084 --> 00:18:58,305
I wanted it to be like healthy relationships

438
00:18:58,345 --> 00:18:58,905
and stuff like that,

439
00:18:58,945 --> 00:19:00,627
but I thought how can I work this into this game

440
00:19:00,647 --> 00:19:02,348
because it seems kind of out of left field.

441
00:19:02,848 --> 00:19:04,709
So my thought was what if we have

442
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:07,971
you know, the scene where you're doing a video chat,

443
00:19:08,011 --> 00:19:09,211
and then when we jump into that one,

444
00:19:10,011 --> 00:19:11,652
it's implied that it's more of a dream,

445
00:19:11,672 --> 00:19:13,052
because then it puts it more about myself,

446
00:19:13,592 --> 00:19:15,453
and like what I'm thinking,

447
00:19:15,913 --> 00:19:18,493
as opposed to, you know, suggesting that it's with my partner

448
00:19:18,673 --> 00:19:20,174
or something else, because that's a little bit weird.

449
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:22,034
And then after that scene,

450
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:23,495
we go into where you're in the room,

451
00:19:23,755 --> 00:19:25,915
you're by yourself, and then you see a helicopter outside,

452
00:19:25,935 --> 00:19:27,356
because for any of you that live in the hood,

453
00:19:27,376 --> 00:19:28,716
a lot of times it's not uncommon

454
00:19:28,736 --> 00:19:30,276
to wake up in the middle of the night to a helicopter

455
00:19:30,316 --> 00:19:32,017
circling around your neighborhood looking for somebody.

456
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:33,697
So that was like an emotional beat

457
00:19:33,717 --> 00:19:34,958
that I wanted to put in as well,

458
00:19:34,978 --> 00:19:35,318
to kind of...

459
00:19:35,678 --> 00:19:36,518
switch up the flow.

460
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:39,480
And then the last scene, I'm working with my friend

461
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,682
Paloma Dawkins, and we're doing this sort of like

462
00:19:41,762 --> 00:19:43,583
mini adventure game, and it's not, you know,

463
00:19:43,623 --> 00:19:45,244
just one scene, and there's things you can click on,

464
00:19:45,264 --> 00:19:47,265
there's dialogue, and you know, a little bit of a sense

465
00:19:47,305 --> 00:19:49,466
of progression, and this is an example too,

466
00:19:49,486 --> 00:19:51,568
of when you make video game mixtapes, what you can do,

467
00:19:51,628 --> 00:19:54,209
or at least when you're making these sort of short vignettes

468
00:19:54,269 --> 00:19:56,411
is as a designer, I can build out the system.

469
00:19:56,471 --> 00:19:57,892
She actually just drew a bunch of sketches

470
00:19:57,932 --> 00:19:59,533
when we were hanging out, and then I chopped up

471
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,414
those sketches and put those in just so you can see

472
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:02,614
what the game's gonna look like.

473
00:20:03,495 --> 00:20:07,979
So then I'm building out a lot of the pieces and then showing it back to her and then she comes back in and puts

474
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:11,483
The art in and that's kind of the beauty too is because when you're making these small pieces

475
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:15,626
I'm not asking an artist. Hey, do you want to commit to my project for the next two years and do all the art for it?

476
00:20:15,827 --> 00:20:16,247
No, hey

477
00:20:16,267 --> 00:20:20,031
Do you want to come in and do your magic on this one piece and just do a couple drawings and I can make them

478
00:20:20,071 --> 00:20:20,491
work and do

479
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:23,594
You know make it work for what we're trying to do

480
00:20:25,276 --> 00:20:29,664
uh... but yeah that's that's another chapter uh... here's update and as few

481
00:20:29,724 --> 00:20:31,167
other examples that i want to look at

482
00:20:31,888 --> 00:20:33,411
uh... this is lump of this is a

483
00:20:34,673 --> 00:20:37,298
game that i made with a very talented artist uh... amy

484
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:41,284
Amy Huang, and she did some of the art on Freakin' Weekend.

485
00:20:42,045 --> 00:20:43,686
So for here, we went through a similar process,

486
00:20:43,706 --> 00:20:44,807
and she kinda got what I was doing

487
00:20:44,847 --> 00:20:47,048
with the Freakin' Weekend as a mixtape,

488
00:20:47,068 --> 00:20:48,749
so she kinda went in and did her own thing.

489
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,551
So we have these vignettes,

490
00:20:50,571 --> 00:20:52,372
you can see you're putting stickers on the phone,

491
00:20:52,592 --> 00:20:54,213
and it's like a gift from somebody.

492
00:20:54,293 --> 00:20:56,175
Oh, it's about, we made this for the Yuri Game Jam,

493
00:20:56,195 --> 00:20:58,096
so it's about, you know, unrequited love.

494
00:20:59,277 --> 00:21:02,739
yeah, you know, attraction crushes between two people, or two youth.

495
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:09,502
So one, they're, you know, watching TV, and as you click on the TV to change the channels, it progresses the dialogue.

496
00:21:10,443 --> 00:21:13,885
And then the bottom one, you can see, you click on the bottle caps, they fly around.

497
00:21:14,525 --> 00:21:17,586
And all these mechanics were kind of driven by this idea of being in the suburbs and being

498
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:21,487
bored and how can we build a game around that. So we just got together and jammed and knocked

499
00:21:21,527 --> 00:21:25,028
each of these pieces out. Um, this one's a little bit different though because it doesn't

500
00:21:25,048 --> 00:21:28,869
really require a certain order. If we can weekend, I do want you to play every piece in a

501
00:21:28,909 --> 00:21:32,289
certain order for the montage to make sense. But this one, they're a little bit more free

502
00:21:32,329 --> 00:21:35,510
form. So you have, we have this order that we want you to play them in that where we list

503
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:38,651
the apps on the top right, um, from top to bottom.

504
00:21:39,671 --> 00:21:41,753
But any order that you play it in doesn't really matter.

505
00:21:41,773 --> 00:21:43,875
A lot of people have done let's play videos, and it's

506
00:21:43,915 --> 00:21:45,696
kind of cool to see people explore them in different

507
00:21:45,736 --> 00:21:48,098
orders, but everyone kind of gets the same themes and the

508
00:21:48,118 --> 00:21:48,678
same ideas.

509
00:21:48,738 --> 00:21:50,940
After they played a couple of them, oh, OK, I'm starting to

510
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,922
get what that means.

511
00:21:53,482 --> 00:21:55,324
And this is available on itch.io if you want to

512
00:21:55,344 --> 00:21:55,664
download it.

513
00:21:55,684 --> 00:21:56,064
It's free.

514
00:21:56,425 --> 00:21:56,705
L-U-M-P-O.

515
00:21:58,286 --> 00:21:59,186
And this is also on itch.

516
00:21:59,246 --> 00:22:00,787
This is Spooky Game Snacks EP.

517
00:22:00,827 --> 00:22:02,587
So I made a bunch of little short,

518
00:22:03,147 --> 00:22:06,088
I did this for Game-tober, something that I guess I made up,

519
00:22:06,108 --> 00:22:07,888
but Inktober, people were doing in October,

520
00:22:07,948 --> 00:22:09,889
drawing a day, so I thought it'd be kind of fun,

521
00:22:09,909 --> 00:22:11,049
what if we made a game a day?

522
00:22:11,069 --> 00:22:13,429
And not like a crazy game, but like a one-button game,

523
00:22:13,449 --> 00:22:14,710
a one-interaction game.

524
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,510
So the first one is Pumpkin Butt,

525
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:17,630
that's in the top left corner.

526
00:22:18,131 --> 00:22:20,691
And that one, you tap on the pumpkin and it explodes.

527
00:22:20,811 --> 00:22:22,712
It's called Pumpkin Butt because I'm not a good modeler,

528
00:22:22,752 --> 00:22:24,772
so I couldn't make it look like a real pumpkin inside,

529
00:22:24,832 --> 00:22:25,972
so because it looked all round,

530
00:22:26,132 --> 00:22:27,893
I'll just change the title, it's called Pumpkin Butt.

531
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:30,135
And that's intentional.

532
00:22:30,155 --> 00:22:32,056
But that one, you know, you just press it, it squishes,

533
00:22:33,037 --> 00:22:33,958
makes a really good sound.

534
00:22:34,698 --> 00:22:35,819
But it's just kind of like on or off.

535
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:37,881
And it's juicy, but you know, there's not a lot of room

536
00:22:37,921 --> 00:22:39,142
for player exploration.

537
00:22:39,863 --> 00:22:42,365
So we have Candy Corn is Gross, which is in the top right corner

538
00:22:42,405 --> 00:22:43,526
where you're just clicking around.

539
00:22:43,546 --> 00:22:46,148
And you can throw candy corn in the trash where it belongs.

540
00:22:47,277 --> 00:22:49,198
Or you could throw it on the floor and other places.

541
00:22:49,959 --> 00:22:53,162
And you can see in the bottom corner I have these arrows.

542
00:22:53,182 --> 00:22:54,863
So rather than having this forced progression,

543
00:22:54,903 --> 00:22:56,845
when you're ready to move on from this game to the next one,

544
00:22:56,865 --> 00:22:59,127
you can click on the arrow and it'll move you along.

545
00:22:59,648 --> 00:23:02,010
The bottom left one is Coco de Paleta,

546
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:05,213
which is a coconut popsicle, Mexican popsicle.

547
00:23:05,713 --> 00:23:06,874
And when I made this in October,

548
00:23:06,934 --> 00:23:08,996
it was like 85 degrees in Los Angeles.

549
00:23:09,016 --> 00:23:10,077
So it's like super hot

550
00:23:10,297 --> 00:23:11,598
and it doesn't feel like autumn at all.

551
00:23:11,638 --> 00:23:12,880
But I thought it'd be funny to have a...

552
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,943
you know, a little snack break halfway between these five pieces.

553
00:23:16,983 --> 00:23:20,025
And then afterwards, the fourth one is Spider Friend.

554
00:23:20,425 --> 00:23:23,448
And that one, you're talking to the spider, and then you realize it lives in your ear,

555
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:24,769
and it's kind of gross.

556
00:23:24,849 --> 00:23:27,691
But, you know, a chance to kick up the narrative a little bit more.

557
00:23:27,731 --> 00:23:30,693
So one is just kind of this, the pumpkin to draw you in,

558
00:23:30,773 --> 00:23:34,015
the candy corn to make it more playful and give you more room for self-expression,

559
00:23:34,096 --> 00:23:37,458
the paleta to kind of take a break where you click and it just eats itself and then it falls,

560
00:23:37,858 --> 00:23:40,821
the spider one to have a little bit of a narrative kick where all of a sudden it's like,

561
00:23:41,001 --> 00:23:41,861
uh-oh, now what's going on?

562
00:23:42,222 --> 00:23:44,085
And then the last one, I call it Glitch Kitty,

563
00:23:44,165 --> 00:23:46,569
and that one you play as a cat on a broomstick

564
00:23:46,629 --> 00:23:49,674
flying over this world, and you can wave magic in the air.

565
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:53,251
And my friend Clover in Sea Life did a really great song for it.

566
00:23:53,411 --> 00:23:56,532
It's about a 45-second song, and at the end, we fade out to the title.

567
00:23:56,872 --> 00:23:59,853
So I really like it because I feel like it's a nice crescendo and climax,

568
00:23:59,893 --> 00:24:01,994
and we have this song that sort of caps off everything

569
00:24:02,034 --> 00:24:04,515
and really does make it feel like what I call an EP,

570
00:24:04,535 --> 00:24:06,136
which would be an extended play in music,

571
00:24:06,216 --> 00:24:08,637
but, you know, for our intents and purposes,

572
00:24:08,717 --> 00:24:10,498
it's another video game mixtape.

573
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:14,019
And a lot of these ideas stem from this guy,

574
00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:16,340
or at least I take inspiration from this guy.

575
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,421
This is Gunpei Yokoi, who designed...

576
00:24:18,997 --> 00:24:22,759
the Game Boy and the Virtual Boy and he's a, working for, worked for Nintendo,

577
00:24:22,779 --> 00:24:25,480
a late, late designer, but, um,

578
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:29,762
he talked about lateral thinking with withered technology, and that's this idea

579
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:32,783
that we have all this technology available to us now, it's cheap, it's

580
00:24:32,823 --> 00:24:36,064
accessible, we all know how to use Unity, there's lots of documentation,

581
00:24:36,084 --> 00:24:39,246
uh, our players, they know how to play screen-based games, they know how to play

582
00:24:39,266 --> 00:24:42,347
games on their phone, uh, so if everything's so accessible

583
00:24:42,847 --> 00:24:45,388
and affordable, then we should think laterally of what...

584
00:24:45,749 --> 00:24:46,929
kind of stories you want to tell,

585
00:24:46,969 --> 00:24:48,890
let's use it to tell stories in innovative

586
00:24:48,931 --> 00:24:50,752
and new ways that people haven't done yet

587
00:24:50,792 --> 00:24:52,573
rather than always chasing the cutting edge.

588
00:24:52,613 --> 00:24:54,594
Everyone's gonna always chase after that.

589
00:24:54,654 --> 00:24:56,495
Did you saw the line for the VR talk next door?

590
00:24:56,515 --> 00:24:58,496
It's like down over to the bathroom,

591
00:24:58,536 --> 00:25:00,618
but I'm very grateful for all of you to be here with me.

592
00:25:01,638 --> 00:25:04,760
So VR is super expensive for developers

593
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,501
as well as for consumers.

594
00:25:06,561 --> 00:25:09,883
So if you stick to withered technology,

595
00:25:10,764 --> 00:25:12,285
we can make things that are certainly more accessible

596
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:13,626
to the larger group of people.

597
00:25:14,864 --> 00:25:17,494
So to wrap up, a couple of keys to video game mixtapes.

598
00:25:18,498 --> 00:25:20,064
One is to embrace the creative freedom.

599
00:25:21,397 --> 00:25:23,177
So as you make it, you can just make whatever you want.

600
00:25:23,197 --> 00:25:25,978
Just make a bunch of little pieces and you know,

601
00:25:25,998 --> 00:25:27,858
you can figure out what it's going to be as you make them.

602
00:25:27,878 --> 00:25:30,719
You might notice trends in your art or what you're interested in.

603
00:25:31,179 --> 00:25:32,780
And you'll figure out the order as you make it.

604
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,100
Some of these seem like they're well planned out, but it's not.

605
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,001
I just made a bunch of things that I thought would be kind of cool

606
00:25:37,081 --> 00:25:39,441
and then I figured out later how can we start piecing them together

607
00:25:39,461 --> 00:25:41,702
because I had to show some work to my class.

608
00:25:41,802 --> 00:25:42,802
Okay, I have three.

609
00:25:42,842 --> 00:25:45,843
Let's just piece them together and come up with a retro script,

610
00:25:45,883 --> 00:25:47,163
a story as to why.

611
00:25:48,064 --> 00:25:50,828
But just remember that the players are going to figure out, or they're going to make up

612
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:53,993
the connections for you so you don't have to be explicit with it.

613
00:25:54,133 --> 00:25:57,278
And it's the diversity of experiences is what's really going to enhance the mix.

614
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,141
Two is to keep it flexible and modular.

615
00:26:01,201 --> 00:26:03,343
The beauty about working in this way is if,

616
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:05,945
like for me, I got like way better every couple months

617
00:26:05,965 --> 00:26:07,086
that I was working on this project,

618
00:26:07,106 --> 00:26:08,927
so I could just quarantine all the bad code.

619
00:26:08,987 --> 00:26:10,589
Like, oh my God, why did I code it this way?

620
00:26:10,929 --> 00:26:12,770
Well, it works, so we'll just put that in the corner

621
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:13,771
and not touch it anymore,

622
00:26:13,811 --> 00:26:15,372
not build any systems on top of that.

623
00:26:15,833 --> 00:26:17,694
But, you know, we have this piece that works,

624
00:26:18,014 --> 00:26:19,816
and then we'll just make sure the next piece that we do,

625
00:26:19,896 --> 00:26:22,478
we're gonna code it and organize our files

626
00:26:22,518 --> 00:26:23,279
in a much better way.

627
00:26:24,389 --> 00:26:28,151
And if you make something cool later, it doesn't have to be a ton of work to implement it because

628
00:26:28,191 --> 00:26:31,093
it's a mix so you can just add in this cool thing afterwards.

629
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:36,095
As well as like I mentioned earlier, it's a great way to get collaborators to work because

630
00:26:36,115 --> 00:26:39,357
you're building these small pieces and it's much more visible and tangible for them how

631
00:26:39,377 --> 00:26:39,997
they would fit in.

632
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:43,359
Oh, I need you to make this art look better, I need you to do a song for this little piece,

633
00:26:43,399 --> 00:26:44,140
I need you to do...

634
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:48,342
sound effects or code to make some of these things smooth and out.

635
00:26:48,362 --> 00:26:52,748
There's a lot that we can do, you know, to respect people's times,

636
00:26:52,888 --> 00:26:55,892
both for our fellow developers as well as for the players.

637
00:26:56,874 --> 00:26:59,597
Get in, do your thing, and get out. That's a big part of it, right?

638
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:01,460
You don't want to just linger too long on one piece

639
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,942
because someone might get bored or...

640
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:05,984
you know, I think it's good to err on the side of caution because you could say, oh,

641
00:27:06,004 --> 00:27:09,126
have you played my game? No. Okay, well it just takes a couple minutes and then you're

642
00:27:09,146 --> 00:27:12,527
done versus have you played my game? Cool, well it's a 60 hour experience and you can

643
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:15,789
start off, uh, in the first town or whatever and, you know, people don't have the time

644
00:27:15,829 --> 00:27:21,132
for that. Um, so explore the system, uh, with each piece that you're making, uh, but keep

645
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:22,993
everything moving so that it stays interesting.

646
00:27:24,082 --> 00:27:26,302
And then lastly, especially for younger game developers,

647
00:27:26,382 --> 00:27:28,322
I trust that the process will build your style

648
00:27:28,442 --> 00:27:29,823
and your game development chops.

649
00:27:29,903 --> 00:27:31,303
You know, we're doing repetitions here,

650
00:27:31,343 --> 00:27:33,043
we're making things, we're making a lot of things,

651
00:27:33,123 --> 00:27:34,724
and we're not really concerned about the outcome

652
00:27:34,764 --> 00:27:36,884
of how good they are, if they're gonna make a lot of money,

653
00:27:37,184 --> 00:27:39,565
or anything, we're just focused on this small little piece.

654
00:27:39,645 --> 00:27:41,785
But it's like, you know, making an over-scoped game

655
00:27:41,845 --> 00:27:43,965
or any game that we think is regularly scoped

656
00:27:44,045 --> 00:27:45,226
is like running a marathon.

657
00:27:45,566 --> 00:27:47,326
And for a lot of younger developers, it's like,

658
00:27:47,386 --> 00:27:48,686
well, have you ever worked out before?

659
00:27:48,706 --> 00:27:49,706
Have you ever exercised before?

660
00:27:50,587 --> 00:27:53,431
No, but I think if I run hard enough I can just make it work, right?

661
00:27:53,491 --> 00:27:55,895
Like, no, running a marathon I don't think works that way, right?

662
00:27:55,915 --> 00:27:57,337
You have to work up to it.

663
00:27:57,457 --> 00:28:01,463
So I really believe in this process to build your chops, to build your style,

664
00:28:01,483 --> 00:28:03,205
because things are going to emerge as you start to...

665
00:28:03,926 --> 00:28:05,769
after you get to the 20th thing that you've made,

666
00:28:05,789 --> 00:28:07,011
you're going to be like, oh, I have a style now.

667
00:28:09,223 --> 00:28:10,844
Here's the updated track listing.

668
00:28:11,024 --> 00:28:12,364
Just have a quick outro for you.

669
00:28:13,465 --> 00:28:15,346
A year ago I showed this at the Indie,

670
00:28:15,626 --> 00:28:17,466
I showed Freakin' Weekend at LA Zine Fest

671
00:28:17,526 --> 00:28:19,847
and a journalist said to me that

672
00:28:20,268 --> 00:28:22,589
it was the most immersive experience he had.

673
00:28:22,609 --> 00:28:24,930
He said, it is wildly creative in how it deconstructs

674
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,530
the traditional video game experience.

675
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:28,391
I also think it speaks compellingly

676
00:28:28,451 --> 00:28:30,512
to each player's personal life and modernity,

677
00:28:30,572 --> 00:28:31,812
though it is autobiographical.

678
00:28:32,113 --> 00:28:33,653
There's also an aspect of voyeurism

679
00:28:33,693 --> 00:28:34,994
to the game that is magnetic.

680
00:28:35,534 --> 00:28:36,795
And he sent me this and I'm just like,

681
00:28:36,875 --> 00:28:38,135
wow, that sounds great.

682
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:41,191
Like, sure, that sounds wonderful.

683
00:28:41,231 --> 00:28:42,232
Like, this is my game, okay.

684
00:28:42,953 --> 00:28:43,733
And I think it just kind of,

685
00:28:43,893 --> 00:28:45,695
it's validating for what I did because, again,

686
00:28:45,735 --> 00:28:46,615
I just made all these pieces

687
00:28:46,655 --> 00:28:47,816
and started to string them together,

688
00:28:47,896 --> 00:28:50,238
and then he was able to absorb and abstract

689
00:28:50,298 --> 00:28:51,319
all this meaning from it.

690
00:28:51,399 --> 00:28:52,660
And it's very much intentional,

691
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:55,081
but it just, you know, when you're knee-deep in it,

692
00:28:55,222 --> 00:28:56,703
it doesn't really seem like some of these things

693
00:28:56,743 --> 00:28:57,543
will come across, but.

694
00:28:58,024 --> 00:29:02,110
he got it. Uh and my other favorite hot take on Freakin' Weekend is when I showed it at IndieCade

695
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:06,356
last year. A Japanese game journalist played it and I asked if he wanted to write about it after

696
00:29:06,396 --> 00:29:10,862
playing and it was mainly in regards to the weed scene but he said uh maybe if I wrote about your

697
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:12,264
game I would be fired.

698
00:29:15,141 --> 00:29:16,443
And I thought that was great because,

699
00:29:17,224 --> 00:29:18,326
you know, not that the game is bad,

700
00:29:18,366 --> 00:29:19,507
but it's like, cool, I'm doing something.

701
00:29:19,547 --> 00:29:20,969
I'm doing something that's provoking people,

702
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,491
doing something that might be controversial.

703
00:29:22,551 --> 00:29:23,853
And I think that, you know,

704
00:29:23,933 --> 00:29:26,016
in terms of making video game mixtapes,

705
00:29:26,036 --> 00:29:28,599
there's a lot of room there for people to explore.

706
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:30,522
So, thank you.

707
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:39,882
If you make a video game mixtape, please send it to me.

708
00:29:39,962 --> 00:29:42,623
I would love to play it and see how you interpret

709
00:29:42,863 --> 00:29:43,723
some of these ideas.

710
00:29:43,763 --> 00:29:45,344
I think that some of what I'm talking about here

711
00:29:45,404 --> 00:29:47,505
is very much influenced by a lot of my colleagues

712
00:29:47,545 --> 00:29:49,426
in Los Angeles and other people that I've met.

713
00:29:49,526 --> 00:29:51,887
So, you know, video games, a beautiful thing

714
00:29:51,907 --> 00:29:52,607
because it's global.

715
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:54,688
So I want to see what you have to say

716
00:29:54,708 --> 00:29:55,529
and what you have to make.

717
00:29:56,189 --> 00:29:57,490
If you want to also have an update

718
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:58,490
when Freaking Weekend's out,

719
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:00,191
you can go to freakingweekend.com

720
00:30:00,811 --> 00:30:02,472
and I have a mailing list you can leave me your email

721
00:30:02,692 --> 00:30:03,713
and I will get back to you.

722
00:30:04,512 --> 00:30:07,478
When it's done, do we have time for no questions?

723
00:30:07,578 --> 00:30:08,099
One question?

724
00:30:09,501 --> 00:30:10,122
Any questions?

725
00:30:10,162 --> 00:30:10,583
You don't have to.

726
00:30:10,663 --> 00:30:10,783
One?

727
00:30:13,869 --> 00:30:15,432
Are you gonna ask a question?

728
00:30:16,313 --> 00:30:16,494
Yes.

729
00:30:17,374 --> 00:30:18,614
No, I just want to rap.

730
00:30:19,135 --> 00:30:19,675
You want to rap?

731
00:30:20,195 --> 00:30:25,096
Have you ever thought about doing this in the context of Glitch City, where maybe you

732
00:30:25,136 --> 00:30:29,117
guys independently assemble some sort of, I guess it wouldn't be a mixtape as much as

733
00:30:30,158 --> 00:30:34,859
like a now this is what you call music kind of thing.

734
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:39,119
I've thought about it. It's kind of hard though because everyone's sort of doing their own thing and time is money

735
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:43,124
so it's hard to ask people to step away from their main project to work on something like this.

736
00:30:43,184 --> 00:30:47,711
But that's why I think if I did a lot of the work and just kind of had them come in and just do something for a couple hours that could work.

737
00:30:48,151 --> 00:30:49,694
Another idea that I want to explore is doing a...

738
00:30:50,975 --> 00:30:52,297
Beautiful Corpse, is that what they're called?

739
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:53,678
So just have a Unity project open

740
00:30:53,718 --> 00:30:55,439
and everyone can just take turns going up to it

741
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:56,740
and adding something to it.

742
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,582
So that's like the closest I've thought of it.

743
00:30:58,682 --> 00:31:01,064
But in the future, as I think as some of this

744
00:31:01,144 --> 00:31:03,506
is more explored and more mainstream,

745
00:31:03,546 --> 00:31:05,087
hopefully then more people will get it

746
00:31:05,147 --> 00:31:06,969
and want to put time into it

747
00:31:06,989 --> 00:31:08,530
and we can figure out ways to make it work.

748
00:31:09,611 --> 00:31:10,051
So thank you.

749
00:31:10,552 --> 00:31:12,574
But yeah, thank you everybody for listening,

750
00:31:12,634 --> 00:31:13,174
for being here.

751
00:31:13,234 --> 00:31:15,436
I hope you have a great rest of your conference

752
00:31:15,736 --> 00:31:16,697
and fill out your surveys.

753
00:31:17,298 --> 00:31:17,518
Thank you.
