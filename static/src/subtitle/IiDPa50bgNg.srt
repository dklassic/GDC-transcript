00:00:06,585 --> 00:00:11,648
Welcome everyone. My name is Tooku Takkakallio and I'm a game designer and game leader at Supercell.

2
00:00:12,388 --> 00:00:16,890
I think it's now my fifth time here at GDC and I always find this super inspiring

3
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:20,532
and it's now even more interesting to be here as a talker for the first time.

4
00:00:23,193 --> 00:00:29,356
And why I like so much GDC? I think it's always so cool to hear like people talking about games

5
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:35,458
and how they approach those and get like insights and I kind of decided that I'm gonna do a talk

6
00:00:35,478 --> 00:00:35,698
where I...

7
00:00:36,235 --> 00:00:41,618
go really deep into these details and give some insight,

8
00:00:42,158 --> 00:00:44,560
like information, like how I approach

9
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:45,961
and how we have approached at Supercell

10
00:00:45,981 --> 00:00:47,022
to these design questions.

11
00:00:49,763 --> 00:00:50,744
So first, who am I?

12
00:00:52,365 --> 00:00:56,608
I studied actually theoretical physics as my major,

13
00:00:56,628 --> 00:00:58,769
which is maybe a bit unconventional background.

14
00:01:02,927 --> 00:01:09,508
I, of course, like every theoretical physicist tries to solve the theory of everything, I also, of course, but I didn't, unfortunately.

15
00:01:09,548 --> 00:01:13,389
But I did spend some time as a researcher, a postdoc researcher.

16
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:19,351
For me, like, games and designing games has been always a big hobby.

17
00:01:19,671 --> 00:01:24,792
So board games especially, I've done a lot of those as a game designer.

18
00:01:25,412 --> 00:01:31,134
And that's, maybe Eclipse is my most popular board games.

19
00:01:32,428 --> 00:01:34,569
That kind of led me to mobile gaming as well,

20
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:35,970
and into Supercell.

21
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:41,411
And I joined that about six years ago, a bit more than that.

22
00:01:41,951 --> 00:01:44,472
And I've been there as a game designer and game lead.

23
00:01:46,933 --> 00:01:49,514
So let's start about thinking, what is game development?

24
00:01:50,534 --> 00:01:52,415
And as everybody knows, it starts

25
00:01:52,455 --> 00:01:56,236
with a great idea, your ultimate game concept.

26
00:01:56,296 --> 00:01:59,157
And then it's all about just executing it, right?

27
00:02:00,637 --> 00:02:01,778
Well, at least in my.

28
00:02:02,551 --> 00:02:04,172
experience, it's not quite so.

29
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:06,112
And I started thinking like

30
00:02:06,972 --> 00:02:08,173
in practice, I think like

31
00:02:08,193 --> 00:02:09,773
game development is more like

32
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:11,214
being in a jungle.

33
00:02:12,594 --> 00:02:14,094
You have your team and

34
00:02:14,695 --> 00:02:15,975
you have maybe some rough idea

35
00:02:16,175 --> 00:02:17,455
what's the game gonna be,

36
00:02:18,236 --> 00:02:19,476
what kind of game you are trying to make.

37
00:02:20,236 --> 00:02:22,197
And the game is somewhere hidden in the jungle

38
00:02:22,537 --> 00:02:24,258
and you try to find it.

39
00:02:25,818 --> 00:02:26,458
And if you think

40
00:02:26,658 --> 00:02:28,159
what's the role for the game designer,

41
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:30,339
I think game designer can be like

42
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:31,480
a scout in the jungle.

43
00:02:31,997 --> 00:02:36,038
try to find the best path and avoid getting lost.

44
00:02:37,399 --> 00:02:39,419
And there are a lot of traps, and you, of course,

45
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:41,380
want to try to avoid those as well.

46
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,861
So you could say that the goals for the game design

47
00:02:45,921 --> 00:02:47,762
is kind of find the best path through the jungle

48
00:02:47,962 --> 00:02:50,342
and minimize the time spent lost there.

49
00:02:51,183 --> 00:02:54,304
And sometimes it is hard to know when to push forward

50
00:02:54,384 --> 00:02:57,324
and when to change path completely, or even

51
00:02:57,364 --> 00:02:58,285
leave the jungle altogether.

52
00:03:01,153 --> 00:03:04,075
Today I'm going to talk about my adventures in the jungle.

53
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:06,896
And I have here three different examples.

54
00:03:08,057 --> 00:03:13,340
And these jungles, they turn to be Hay Day, Boom Beach,

55
00:03:13,941 --> 00:03:14,861
and Brawl Stars.

56
00:03:15,782 --> 00:03:17,523
And when we started all of these projects,

57
00:03:17,543 --> 00:03:20,705
we had a very small team, three to six people,

58
00:03:20,725 --> 00:03:21,605
depending on the game.

59
00:03:24,922 --> 00:03:31,645
Yeah, only in the beginning you have a kind of a rough idea of what you want to do, but this is where we kind of ended up with the team.

60
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:39,329
In the first two, in Hay Day and Boom Beach, I was a game designer and in the Brawl Stars I was a game lead for the ninth first month of development,

61
00:03:39,589 --> 00:03:46,673
but I then left to help another team and now currently I'm working on a completely new game team as a game lead.

62
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:52,116
But I try to pick these practical examples from these adventures.

63
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:58,378
and go through them and maybe you'll get some learnings out of those.

64
00:04:00,499 --> 00:04:01,599
Let's start with Hay Day.

65
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,440
Hay Day was released roughly six years ago.

66
00:04:05,501 --> 00:04:08,602
It is a farming game where you build and manage your farm.

67
00:04:10,002 --> 00:04:13,664
It is a game where you produce goods and then you sell them.

68
00:04:14,424 --> 00:04:17,485
And you have this order board, which you can...

69
00:04:18,297 --> 00:04:21,178
where you get these orders and you complete the orders

70
00:04:21,278 --> 00:04:24,719
by tapping the button on the corner there.

71
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:28,280
And you get the reward, which is coins and XP.

72
00:04:29,301 --> 00:04:33,222
And you use those resources then to build your farm even more

73
00:04:33,462 --> 00:04:33,763
nicer.

74
00:04:35,863 --> 00:04:41,886
So when we started Hay Day, our thinking was that, OK,

75
00:04:42,066 --> 00:04:43,846
there are some farming games on mobile.

76
00:04:44,147 --> 00:04:47,468
But they were more like ports from other platforms.

77
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:50,753
And we wanted to make this native mobile experience.

78
00:04:51,714 --> 00:04:53,915
And we also felt like the farming genre is actually

79
00:04:53,955 --> 00:04:57,518
quite cool, but many games just don't fulfill that potential.

80
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:02,703
And yeah, regarding Hay Day, there's

81
00:05:02,723 --> 00:05:03,924
like three topics I want to cover.

82
00:05:05,165 --> 00:05:07,987
First one is like how we approach the UI design,

83
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,510
then about the balancing of the economy, and then trading.

84
00:05:13,632 --> 00:05:15,573
And I'm going to start with the UI part.

85
00:05:16,014 --> 00:05:16,494
So as said.

86
00:05:17,248 --> 00:05:21,491
We wanted to make this native mobile experience designed

87
00:05:21,511 --> 00:05:22,812
for touch devices.

88
00:05:24,173 --> 00:05:29,436
And when we started that, we had a few core pillars

89
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,618
in our mind for the UI.

90
00:05:33,018 --> 00:05:35,440
So first one was that we wanted the player

91
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,881
to be the main character.

92
00:05:38,662 --> 00:05:41,684
And so what it means is that the player's action

93
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:45,687
starts from the player's hand, such as planting seeds

94
00:05:45,767 --> 00:05:46,788
or harvesting crops.

95
00:05:47,517 --> 00:05:51,919
And we didn't want to have any avatar in the game, which was quite normal at that point, at least.

96
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,062
We wanted the game to be as intuitive as possible, so follow real-world examples.

97
00:05:58,862 --> 00:06:04,284
And, for example, we didn't want that players would collect coins from fields, for example.

98
00:06:05,084 --> 00:06:09,986
And when you craft goods, the recipes try to follow real-world examples.

99
00:06:14,285 --> 00:06:16,226
We wanted to represent things inside the game

100
00:06:16,326 --> 00:06:18,608
and avoid these floating icons, because we felt

101
00:06:18,648 --> 00:06:21,010
that it breaks the immersion.

102
00:06:23,812 --> 00:06:26,415
So how we tried to represent the visual states in the game

103
00:06:26,435 --> 00:06:26,635
world.

104
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:27,936
I have a few examples here.

105
00:06:28,877 --> 00:06:29,597
So here's a chicken.

106
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:32,399
And here's a pig.

107
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,663
And you can see the different states going from hungry, fed,

108
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:38,625
and then ready to be collected.

109
00:06:38,645 --> 00:06:42,027
OK, I said we wanted to follow a real world example,

110
00:06:42,087 --> 00:06:42,208
but.

111
00:06:42,887 --> 00:06:46,690
In case of pig, we had a problem, like, how do you get bacon out of it?

112
00:06:47,171 --> 00:06:49,713
So we wanted to be nice people.

113
00:06:49,753 --> 00:06:54,457
And we are from Finland, so for us, the obvious solution was, of course, sauna.

114
00:06:54,657 --> 00:06:57,639
So we have a big sauna in game, which helps you to extract bacon.

115
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,281
Makes sense, right?

116
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:03,144
OK.

117
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:06,366
About the UI thing.

118
00:07:06,406 --> 00:07:10,069
So we had this idea of making a game for touch devices.

119
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,241
In the beginning, like, how exactly it would work.

120
00:07:13,461 --> 00:07:16,803
So I actually found this PowerPoint prototype

121
00:07:16,863 --> 00:07:17,543
I did back then.

122
00:07:17,963 --> 00:07:22,625
And from there, you can see how we approach this.

123
00:07:22,645 --> 00:07:24,066
So player taps the field.

124
00:07:25,447 --> 00:07:31,770
And then you use this tool and collect the carrots.

125
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:33,270
And that's it.

126
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,012
So it doesn't need to be fancy, at least.

127
00:07:36,052 --> 00:07:38,033
Well, this was the only good tool

128
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,593
we knew to use at that time.

129
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:42,892
OK, so how it ended up in the game.

130
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:47,953
So here, you can see player tapping the field,

131
00:07:48,314 --> 00:07:51,955
taking the sickle, and dragging the sickle to harvest the weeds.

132
00:07:52,795 --> 00:07:56,116
And the action starts from the player's hand, as we wanted.

133
00:08:00,817 --> 00:08:02,958
So what are the pros and cons for dragging-based UIs?

134
00:08:04,158 --> 00:08:08,079
It is a very fun and natural way to interact with the world.

135
00:08:09,758 --> 00:08:11,939
And there's this bonus thing, which is kind of side thing,

136
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,580
but I wanted to mention it anyways.

137
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,182
So when you are dragging, it's possible to actually show

138
00:08:18,222 --> 00:08:19,443
some extra information.

139
00:08:20,243 --> 00:08:23,104
So what I mean is you can see from the planting.

140
00:08:23,405 --> 00:08:24,645
Now, player is planting the wheat.

141
00:08:25,266 --> 00:08:29,047
And when you drag the wheat, you can see the number moving.

142
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:31,989
And that kind of shows you how much you have wheat left.

143
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:35,331
Can be convenient.

144
00:08:36,751 --> 00:08:38,652
It is kind of hard to make everything consistent.

145
00:08:39,505 --> 00:08:41,606
with dragging, you still need some tapping,

146
00:08:41,786 --> 00:08:43,907
and that's just reality.

147
00:08:44,027 --> 00:08:45,908
There are menus, there are buttons to confirm.

148
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:51,710
And also, creating this kind of hierarchy is a bit difficult,

149
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:53,951
because basically everything needs to be in one layer,

150
00:08:54,351 --> 00:08:58,093
and it can become messy and heavy for the UI.

151
00:09:03,255 --> 00:09:06,216
OK, next topic was about balancing the economy

152
00:09:06,236 --> 00:09:06,636
for Hay Day.

153
00:09:08,605 --> 00:09:13,307
So what I mean by economy, I mean the coins, XP's and unlocks.

154
00:09:14,227 --> 00:09:20,169
So when in Heyday when player progresses, he gains XP which unlocks you new buildings

155
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:23,330
and then you use coins to buy those buildings in your farm.

156
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:30,672
And why this is... yeah, I should add that player can play the game for several years

157
00:09:31,192 --> 00:09:35,133
and it's a long journey. So why this is important?

158
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,841
In this type of games, a player has these goals

159
00:09:37,881 --> 00:09:39,142
that I want to build the next building.

160
00:09:39,242 --> 00:09:39,842
I want to do that.

161
00:09:40,223 --> 00:09:44,625
And if the balance goes off, the game loses its meaning.

162
00:09:44,745 --> 00:09:46,226
So we felt that it's really important

163
00:09:46,266 --> 00:09:49,228
to keep the economy in balance so that every time you unlock

164
00:09:49,248 --> 00:09:51,909
a new building, it is something that you can actually build,

165
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,812
or at least it's like you don't have too much coins

166
00:09:55,872 --> 00:09:57,153
or too little coins at that point.

167
00:10:01,035 --> 00:10:02,696
And in Hay Day, how do you get these coins?

168
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:04,917
So you have this order board, which I mentioned.

169
00:10:05,846 --> 00:10:08,528
And here you can see the goods you need from the order.

170
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:11,489
And here is the reward for that order.

171
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:14,051
So when you fulfill that, you get the reward.

172
00:10:15,211 --> 00:10:17,773
And now the question is, like, the starting point of all

173
00:10:18,093 --> 00:10:21,395
of the economy is, like, how do you value the goods?

174
00:10:22,236 --> 00:10:24,337
What is how much you get when you sell a carrot?

175
00:10:24,437 --> 00:10:27,659
How much you get when you sell a cream, for example?

176
00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:30,680
So let's take a cookie as an example.

177
00:10:32,361 --> 00:10:34,743
You get coins and XP by selling it.

178
00:10:36,066 --> 00:10:40,267
And how much, of course you can just input some numbers there

179
00:10:40,287 --> 00:10:42,068
randomly and hope for the best, but it

180
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:44,389
might make sense to have a bit more systematic approach

181
00:10:44,429 --> 00:10:44,909
to all of this.

182
00:10:46,469 --> 00:10:49,410
So how we approached this was that we

183
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:52,451
took the base fundamental resource to be time,

184
00:10:52,732 --> 00:10:55,873
which is quite a used thing.

185
00:10:56,633 --> 00:10:58,053
So we said time is diamonds.

186
00:10:58,553 --> 00:10:59,314
And what are diamonds?

187
00:10:59,354 --> 00:11:00,954
They are the premium currency in Hay Day,

188
00:11:01,514 --> 00:11:04,676
but in here they mean more like an abstract quantity that

189
00:11:04,696 --> 00:11:05,676
helps us to balance.

190
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,608
and keep everything in control.

191
00:11:08,928 --> 00:11:12,190
But it is actually the diamond value for the stuff as well.

192
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:14,911
OK, so time is diamonds.

193
00:11:15,511 --> 00:11:18,293
But the relation in HEDA is not exactly linear.

194
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:21,294
They are not linearly proportional.

195
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,695
But there's this a bit more complicated function

196
00:11:24,575 --> 00:11:25,976
that maps time to diamonds.

197
00:11:27,016 --> 00:11:29,598
And I tried to draw it there.

198
00:11:29,918 --> 00:11:30,238
You see?

199
00:11:31,098 --> 00:11:33,279
And what it means is that on x-axis, you have time.

200
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,600
And on the y-axis, it maps the time to diamonds.

201
00:11:36,092 --> 00:11:37,132
So let's take an example.

202
00:11:38,013 --> 00:11:42,416
If something takes 100 minutes, that would map to seven

203
00:11:42,456 --> 00:11:42,797
diamonds.

204
00:11:44,298 --> 00:11:46,239
If something would take 40 minutes,

205
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,461
that value would be five diamonds.

206
00:11:53,364 --> 00:11:55,866
OK, now we have this relation between time and diamonds.

207
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:57,988
And how we use it in Hay Day is that we assigned

208
00:11:58,528 --> 00:12:00,370
for each good a diamond value.

209
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:04,252
And that's based on production time it takes to make the good

210
00:12:04,973 --> 00:12:05,453
and also.

211
00:12:07,528 --> 00:12:10,710
the value of ingredients that are needed to make the good.

212
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:14,251
I'll break it down, so explain it a bit carefully next.

213
00:12:16,672 --> 00:12:17,813
So let's take a cookie.

214
00:12:20,034 --> 00:12:22,595
Cookie is made out of two wheats, two eggs,

215
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:25,716
one brown sugar, and 60 minutes of production time.

216
00:12:28,397 --> 00:12:31,058
Wheat takes two minutes to produce,

217
00:12:31,178 --> 00:12:32,479
so that would map to one diamond.

218
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,500
Egg needs chicken feed.

219
00:12:36,236 --> 00:12:37,616
and 20 minutes of production time.

220
00:12:37,696 --> 00:12:39,517
And all together, those would map to four diamonds.

221
00:12:40,497 --> 00:12:41,758
Brown sugar, similarly.

222
00:12:42,218 --> 00:12:44,698
Sugar grain plus 20 minutes of production time, five diamonds.

223
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:49,840
And then you bake the cookie in bakery, which is 60 minutes.

224
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,520
And that's six diamonds.

225
00:12:53,081 --> 00:12:54,341
So when you put all of these together,

226
00:12:55,622 --> 00:12:58,082
you have a diamond value for the cookie.

227
00:12:58,582 --> 00:13:00,423
And that's the premium currency value you would use,

228
00:13:00,483 --> 00:13:02,524
but also tells you how valuable this is.

229
00:13:03,764 --> 00:13:03,864
So.

230
00:13:04,391 --> 00:13:06,653
How to get from here to the coin and XP value?

231
00:13:07,293 --> 00:13:07,814
Very simple.

232
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:11,617
We used just a multiplier for the diamond value.

233
00:13:12,237 --> 00:13:15,860
Let's call it constant A. And then the XP goes same way.

234
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,942
We have another multiplier B, which

235
00:13:18,962 --> 00:13:21,484
you just multiply the diamond value and get the XP value.

236
00:13:22,105 --> 00:13:26,008
So with certain values, we get something

237
00:13:26,048 --> 00:13:29,310
like this for the cookie.

238
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:34,410
OK, why this was beneficial in the first place?

239
00:13:36,332 --> 00:13:38,593
It means that all goods are valued in a consistent way.

240
00:13:38,874 --> 00:13:40,955
If someone creates a new good and puts it

241
00:13:40,995 --> 00:13:42,756
in their spreadsheet, you immediately

242
00:13:42,796 --> 00:13:44,097
have all the values there.

243
00:13:45,718 --> 00:13:47,580
And the player experience is consistent.

244
00:13:49,501 --> 00:13:52,223
And then the balance is very easy to tweak,

245
00:13:52,663 --> 00:13:54,424
because now we have this huge spreadsheet with all

246
00:13:54,484 --> 00:13:56,926
these goods, and we can just tweak A and B parameters,

247
00:13:56,966 --> 00:14:00,168
basically, and change the economy easily.

248
00:14:04,612 --> 00:14:06,513
The diamond value was also used as a tool

249
00:14:06,593 --> 00:14:08,314
to generate the orders in the first place.

250
00:14:09,555 --> 00:14:13,517
So how we do it, here's an example of order.

251
00:14:14,198 --> 00:14:16,899
And it consists of a certain amount of goods.

252
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,702
And how we do it is when we set a target diamond

253
00:14:20,722 --> 00:14:22,603
value for the order, it could be like 100.

254
00:14:22,923 --> 00:14:27,306
We want an order which is worth 100 diamonds, basically.

255
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:32,650
Then we generate this order by adding.

256
00:14:33,287 --> 00:14:35,948
one to six goods, so different good types,

257
00:14:36,228 --> 00:14:38,408
and start filling the order one by one with these goods

258
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:40,269
until we reach target diamond value.

259
00:14:42,169 --> 00:14:45,710
And the target diamond value scales as player progresses,

260
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:49,550
so you get bigger and more varied orders

261
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,311
in the later in the game.

262
00:14:51,571 --> 00:14:53,451
And then we spice up the reward a little bit.

263
00:14:53,471 --> 00:14:56,412
So we shift the balance between coins and XP.

264
00:14:56,632 --> 00:14:58,292
It's kind of a small addition to give.

265
00:14:59,975 --> 00:15:03,337
It keeps the overall balance for the order in place,

266
00:15:03,557 --> 00:15:07,680
but it makes a little bit more of these interesting choices

267
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,161
for the player to choose, like, do

268
00:15:09,221 --> 00:15:10,822
I want to make this order, which has more XP,

269
00:15:10,982 --> 00:15:12,203
or that one, which has more coins?

270
00:15:17,026 --> 00:15:18,167
Some afterthoughts about this.

271
00:15:19,007 --> 00:15:22,069
I think overall, this kind of concept of abstract value

272
00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:25,391
can be a great tool to generate the orders

273
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:26,872
and also balance the economy.

274
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,942
And for player, it creates this consistent experience.

275
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:34,085
Note, however, that the real value for the player

276
00:15:34,105 --> 00:15:36,406
doesn't always match to the abstract value.

277
00:15:37,387 --> 00:15:39,789
So for example, we have products like brown sugar.

278
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:44,792
It's used in many recipes, so it becomes almost

279
00:15:44,812 --> 00:15:47,174
like this bottleneck resource in the game.

280
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:49,515
But it doesn't matter.

281
00:15:49,535 --> 00:15:51,837
Those things can give a flavor into the game.

282
00:15:55,169 --> 00:15:58,072
And in practice, there's always these complications

283
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:01,695
and messiness, exceptions.

284
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,516
And they are unavoidable.

285
00:16:03,717 --> 00:16:05,778
And I don't think you should be afraid of those.

286
00:16:05,838 --> 00:16:08,401
But they are on top of the system you have built.

287
00:16:09,281 --> 00:16:11,844
So for example, the cookie actually

288
00:16:11,864 --> 00:16:13,665
is not 21 diamonds in the game.

289
00:16:13,905 --> 00:16:14,286
It's 19.

290
00:16:14,346 --> 00:16:16,928
But I don't want to go into those details too much.

291
00:16:20,071 --> 00:16:21,752
OK, final topic in Hay Day I want to talk about

292
00:16:21,832 --> 00:16:22,433
is the trading.

293
00:16:24,671 --> 00:16:26,831
So we wanted to have a trading in the game from the beginning.

294
00:16:27,592 --> 00:16:30,932
But we wanted to be simple to use,

295
00:16:31,912 --> 00:16:35,513
work with the core gameplay, and then be a social experience

296
00:16:35,553 --> 00:16:35,853
as well.

297
00:16:36,854 --> 00:16:39,034
So it meant that we didn't want to have a, let's say,

298
00:16:39,054 --> 00:16:44,695
stock market, which is kind of faceless and maybe a bit hard

299
00:16:44,715 --> 00:16:45,395
to use as well.

300
00:16:46,796 --> 00:16:47,996
So how we approach this?

301
00:16:48,576 --> 00:16:49,816
Each player has their farm.

302
00:16:50,016 --> 00:16:52,137
And in the farm, they have a roadside shop.

303
00:16:53,537 --> 00:16:54,177
And here, you can.

304
00:16:54,732 --> 00:16:57,214
like put stuff on sale and set the price.

305
00:16:57,494 --> 00:16:58,915
And if someone visits your place,

306
00:16:59,255 --> 00:17:02,017
they can just buy it from your roadside shop

307
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,098
and pay the cost.

308
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,903
So yeah, through the friend list or whatever,

309
00:17:08,943 --> 00:17:11,445
you can visit your friends and check what they have on sale.

310
00:17:12,886 --> 00:17:14,867
And when you place goods on sale,

311
00:17:15,948 --> 00:17:18,250
you select, of course, the type you want to sell,

312
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:20,612
then the amount, and then set a price.

313
00:17:21,392 --> 00:17:21,933
Price for the good.

314
00:17:22,934 --> 00:17:24,195
And I would say like.

315
00:17:24,648 --> 00:17:27,390
Looking back, I think allowing players to set the price

316
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:28,290
was kind of a mistake.

317
00:17:28,931 --> 00:17:30,572
There's two things which it leads to.

318
00:17:30,672 --> 00:17:33,674
One is that players can generate a huge amount of money

319
00:17:33,774 --> 00:17:34,455
through the trading.

320
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:40,119
And then the other, yes, players usually just put the max price

321
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:41,099
for everything anyways.

322
00:17:41,179 --> 00:17:42,580
So it's kind of redundant.

323
00:17:43,341 --> 00:17:45,202
But also there's this interesting thing

324
00:17:45,222 --> 00:17:46,703
that we didn't think about at all,

325
00:17:47,104 --> 00:17:49,925
was that actually bots can use this system.

326
00:17:50,006 --> 00:17:52,167
So you have bot farms that can.

327
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:55,699
trade coins between accounts and create coins and all kind

328
00:17:55,719 --> 00:17:57,301
of hassle related to those.

329
00:18:00,343 --> 00:18:04,606
There's also this button on the bottom part of the UI, which

330
00:18:04,686 --> 00:18:08,569
is where you can place advertisement for the sale.

331
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:12,512
And what it means is that we have this newspaper in the game.

332
00:18:13,052 --> 00:18:18,396
And whenever you activate that tab,

333
00:18:18,436 --> 00:18:20,457
the product or the sale will go to this newspaper.

334
00:18:20,838 --> 00:18:21,798
And now everybody who's

335
00:18:22,305 --> 00:18:25,366
who goes to check the newspaper can see these advertisements.

336
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:29,988
And now, this is a way how players

337
00:18:30,028 --> 00:18:32,709
can access not only their friends' goods,

338
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:37,471
but also people they don't know, and get a bigger feeling of

339
00:18:37,511 --> 00:18:39,392
that there's more trading happening,

340
00:18:39,472 --> 00:18:41,452
and also buy stuff from players they don't know.

341
00:18:42,173 --> 00:18:43,793
So now, if you would tap any of those,

342
00:18:43,953 --> 00:18:47,154
it would lead to the roadside shop of that player.

343
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:49,295
And then you can do the purchase there.

344
00:18:52,283 --> 00:18:55,765
OK, this is more like a general remark for the markets.

345
00:18:56,025 --> 00:19:01,409
So it's kind of obvious, but markets are two-sided always.

346
00:19:02,089 --> 00:19:04,371
And so you have the amount of purchases,

347
00:19:04,531 --> 00:19:07,313
and you have the amount of sales.

348
00:19:07,373 --> 00:19:10,355
And they need to match.

349
00:19:10,575 --> 00:19:11,656
It's kind of obvious, of course.

350
00:19:11,676 --> 00:19:14,698
But why I want to say it is that it's actually

351
00:19:14,758 --> 00:19:18,420
quite hard to create this balanced situation.

352
00:19:18,681 --> 00:19:20,942
Easily, these markets are kind of unstable.

353
00:19:21,696 --> 00:19:24,758
So you have like oversupply or undersupply.

354
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,742
So for example, in case of Hay Day, players want to buy stuff.

355
00:19:29,262 --> 00:19:31,764
But it is kind of much harder to make them sell stuff.

356
00:19:32,345 --> 00:19:34,346
And you need these two things to match.

357
00:19:37,249 --> 00:19:39,410
How we approach that one in Hay Day was that there's

358
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:40,031
like a few things.

359
00:19:40,211 --> 00:19:45,235
One is that we actually limit the storage capacity.

360
00:19:45,515 --> 00:19:48,478
But the additional thing is that we don't allow players

361
00:19:48,518 --> 00:19:49,238
to trash goods.

362
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:53,094
So only way basically to get rid of goods is to put them on sale.

363
00:19:55,614 --> 00:19:57,095
So which will kind of drive them there.

364
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:01,856
And also we have a system which creates certain materials

365
00:20:02,316 --> 00:20:04,796
asymmetrically to the players.

366
00:20:05,897 --> 00:20:07,197
And I'll explain what I mean by that.

367
00:20:09,578 --> 00:20:11,758
So in Hay Day, you have these upgrade materials

368
00:20:12,118 --> 00:20:14,379
which are very valuable for the players.

369
00:20:15,139 --> 00:20:17,819
They are something that you get when you harvest or do

370
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,560
normal actions.

371
00:20:19,023 --> 00:20:23,166
And they come as random drops from those actions.

372
00:20:25,207 --> 00:20:27,629
And how do you use those items?

373
00:20:28,149 --> 00:20:31,911
You upgrade your barn and silo with the items.

374
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,213
An important thing is that you need a set of items,

375
00:20:35,273 --> 00:20:39,356
so equal amount of those goods or materials.

376
00:20:41,617 --> 00:20:43,978
So we divide the player to these groups.

377
00:20:46,098 --> 00:20:47,798
In here, we have a group 1, group 2, group 3.

378
00:20:48,219 --> 00:20:51,059
They all get the same materials, and they

379
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,460
have the overall same drop rate.

380
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:56,301
But the percentages for these individual items,

381
00:20:57,021 --> 00:20:59,542
they are kind of permutated, which

382
00:20:59,562 --> 00:21:02,123
will make that some people will get more of something

383
00:21:02,203 --> 00:21:05,024
than the others, and which will, our hope was that it would kind

384
00:21:05,044 --> 00:21:07,065
of make people trade.

385
00:21:09,565 --> 00:21:11,546
In practice, we have actually 27 of these groups,

386
00:21:11,606 --> 00:21:13,887
because there's more items and there's more permutations.

387
00:21:13,927 --> 00:21:15,267
You can go, but you get the idea.

388
00:21:18,282 --> 00:21:20,944
OK, the idea was that players would sell the surplus

389
00:21:20,984 --> 00:21:21,985
and buy the missing materials.

390
00:21:22,446 --> 00:21:24,387
I think this only kind of worked to some extent.

391
00:21:25,568 --> 00:21:27,870
So players are doing this with their friends,

392
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:29,791
but these items are quite valuable.

393
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:32,093
So in practice, it's not always happening,

394
00:21:32,133 --> 00:21:35,216
but at least somewhat happening.

395
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:39,979
OK, putting this together, what are the pros and cons

396
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,860
for the trading we did?

397
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:46,405
I think it is a kind of easy way to sell and buy stuff.

398
00:21:48,292 --> 00:21:54,056
It is a personal experience, so you are always buying the items from someone else, which is important.

399
00:21:55,537 --> 00:22:03,362
You can also discover other players through the newspaper, and at the same time you can visit their farms and see what they are doing, and maybe get ideas for yourself as well.

400
00:22:05,383 --> 00:22:14,529
In practice, the newspaper is not always the best place to look for. If you are looking for something special, it might be hard to find it.

401
00:22:14,889 --> 00:22:17,751
Also, for active traders, the coin balance is very important.

402
00:22:18,553 --> 00:22:20,794
They can kind of ruin it by just doing a lot of trading.

403
00:22:22,134 --> 00:22:24,035
And then we have the bot problem as well.

404
00:22:25,115 --> 00:22:27,396
So this created a system where bots can actually

405
00:22:28,657 --> 00:22:29,457
exploit the system.

406
00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:36,840
OK, I'm going to switch now to the next game, which

407
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:37,960
is Boom Beach.

408
00:22:40,141 --> 00:22:42,562
It was launched roughly four years ago.

409
00:22:43,983 --> 00:22:47,624
And Boom Beach is a kind of build and battle game.

410
00:22:48,893 --> 00:22:51,534
where you have your own island and you have your own base

411
00:22:51,574 --> 00:22:52,115
in that island.

412
00:22:53,735 --> 00:22:56,896
And you have a map where you can find other players and bases

413
00:22:57,497 --> 00:22:58,377
and attack those.

414
00:22:59,657 --> 00:23:03,079
And in the attacking, you deploy troops on the shore.

415
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:05,239
And the troops have an AI, and they will move.

416
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,440
But in addition, you have this gunboat,

417
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,682
which you can use players to guide the troops

418
00:23:11,882 --> 00:23:13,803
and use different other gunboat abilities

419
00:23:13,843 --> 00:23:14,683
to help in your attack.

420
00:23:15,203 --> 00:23:16,984
So there's a bit more control, perhaps,

421
00:23:17,024 --> 00:23:17,884
than in some other games.

422
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:19,706
with the attacking.

423
00:23:22,207 --> 00:23:24,369
So when we started BoomBeach,

424
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:27,531
one of those initial ideas was that

425
00:23:27,891 --> 00:23:28,892
why we wanted to do this was

426
00:23:29,612 --> 00:23:30,813
there was a clash of clans of course,

427
00:23:30,893 --> 00:23:33,715
and we felt like there's some more directions

428
00:23:33,755 --> 00:23:35,617
we can still explore within this genre.

429
00:23:36,177 --> 00:23:39,960
And one of those main things was that

430
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,981
clash of clans has this matchmaking system

431
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:43,322
where you just press a button

432
00:23:43,362 --> 00:23:44,643
and you're matched against opponents,

433
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,524
or then you have the single player map.

434
00:23:47,143 --> 00:23:49,024
And it's very convenient and easy to use.

435
00:23:49,204 --> 00:23:51,966
But on the other hand, you kind of lose this feeling

436
00:23:52,026 --> 00:23:53,126
of a bigger world.

437
00:23:53,527 --> 00:23:56,488
And they are also separated.

438
00:23:56,929 --> 00:23:58,910
And the other thing was the idea of the controls,

439
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:02,132
that we wanted to give more controls for the player

440
00:24:02,172 --> 00:24:04,733
in the attack with the flare and other gunboat abilities.

441
00:24:04,973 --> 00:24:07,775
So I would say those were kind of the main reasons we

442
00:24:07,815 --> 00:24:09,176
wanted to explore this genre.

443
00:24:11,777 --> 00:24:15,079
And OK, I'm going to talk about, regarding Boom Beach,

444
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,300
about the.

445
00:24:17,278 --> 00:24:19,380
game world and a map, how we built that,

446
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,861
and then about how we balance the combat.

447
00:24:24,043 --> 00:24:26,084
So let's start with the game world and map part.

448
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:29,486
With this one, as I said, we want

449
00:24:29,506 --> 00:24:33,589
to create this more immersive game world where a player would

450
00:24:33,629 --> 00:24:35,830
feel it's not just like a UI but something else.

451
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:39,773
We wanted to introduce exploration element and mystery

452
00:24:39,933 --> 00:24:40,293
with that.

453
00:24:40,613 --> 00:24:42,495
So there's always something hidden in the clouds,

454
00:24:42,555 --> 00:24:44,456
and you can find different interesting stuff.

455
00:24:45,145 --> 00:24:48,486
It creates this nice feeling of progress when you play the game.

456
00:24:49,526 --> 00:24:52,847
We also wanted to combine NPC and PVP enemies

457
00:24:52,887 --> 00:24:54,467
to a single system, which is your map.

458
00:24:56,068 --> 00:24:58,388
But we wanted to avoid these typical problems that

459
00:24:58,428 --> 00:25:00,709
lie in these PVP map-based games.

460
00:25:01,209 --> 00:25:03,229
And I'm going to say a few words about that.

461
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:04,830
So here's a Travian.

462
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:10,091
It's a super cool game with a map where

463
00:25:10,331 --> 00:25:11,371
players are actually placed.

464
00:25:11,671 --> 00:25:14,912
And they have physical coordinates.

465
00:25:16,511 --> 00:25:21,534
And if you attack, depending how far they are from your home,

466
00:25:21,754 --> 00:25:22,635
it takes more time.

467
00:25:24,336 --> 00:25:25,717
So these maps can be really nice,

468
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:27,478
but they have some problems.

469
00:25:28,499 --> 00:25:31,320
Obvious one is when new players joins in, where you place them.

470
00:25:31,561 --> 00:25:34,843
And typically, these games have one server

471
00:25:34,863 --> 00:25:36,244
which can host, say, 10,000 or 20,000 players.

472
00:25:36,264 --> 00:25:38,545
And then you split them to these instances.

473
00:25:47,188 --> 00:25:49,210
They are, like I said, they can't be scaled so well.

474
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:51,531
Not in space, but also not in time.

475
00:25:51,651 --> 00:25:54,413
So when the time moves forward, the dynamics

476
00:25:54,493 --> 00:25:56,535
are many times quite unstable.

477
00:25:57,536 --> 00:26:00,738
So power players dominate easily over time,

478
00:26:00,778 --> 00:26:03,020
and the world can become a really hostile place.

479
00:26:04,321 --> 00:26:06,842
So we wanted to avoid this, but still create some kind of map,

480
00:26:06,942 --> 00:26:08,083
or at least feeling of map.

481
00:26:08,464 --> 00:26:11,546
And the Boom Beach Massif is really a fake map,

482
00:26:11,646 --> 00:26:14,308
but it does it strict to some extent, at least.

483
00:26:16,244 --> 00:26:19,685
So here's the map design, which the map

484
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:21,845
is divided to these very ugly colored regions.

485
00:26:21,865 --> 00:26:22,365
Sorry about that.

486
00:26:22,906 --> 00:26:26,386
But the idea is that these correspond to these clouds

487
00:26:26,446 --> 00:26:27,267
that you can unlock.

488
00:26:27,427 --> 00:26:31,087
And under those, you can find these different kind of nodes.

489
00:26:32,288 --> 00:26:34,888
What I mean by nodes are like PVP opponents,

490
00:26:35,589 --> 00:26:37,149
like treasures, whatever.

491
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:41,930
And here's a map with all of the elements.

492
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,450
This is not like a real in-game picture,

493
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:46,031
but you can see all the different elements.

494
00:26:46,649 --> 00:26:48,790
Or it is from the debug field.

495
00:26:50,031 --> 00:26:54,814
So there's resource bases, PVP bases,

496
00:26:56,055 --> 00:26:57,456
different type of things.

497
00:26:57,676 --> 00:27:01,818
And what you should be thinking or see here

498
00:27:01,878 --> 00:27:04,960
is that it creates this element of scouting and planning.

499
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,501
Because you can see your opponents.

500
00:27:06,902 --> 00:27:11,745
You can tap them and scout them and see how their base is

501
00:27:11,765 --> 00:27:15,447
built, and then decide how I want to approach this base.

502
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:17,681
So it's more like a puzzle almost.

503
00:27:17,721 --> 00:27:19,282
You can attack it multiple times,

504
00:27:19,322 --> 00:27:21,783
choose your army composition, try different things.

505
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:26,404
So it creates a scouting and planning element to the game.

506
00:27:30,465 --> 00:27:32,686
OK, of course, with this kind of map thing,

507
00:27:33,046 --> 00:27:34,726
the question is, how do you find these opponents

508
00:27:34,746 --> 00:27:35,367
in the first place?

509
00:27:36,727 --> 00:27:39,248
And there's a PvP opponent which we

510
00:27:39,288 --> 00:27:42,209
match makes on your map based on the medals, which

511
00:27:42,269 --> 00:27:45,390
is like the trophies in some other games.

512
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:48,886
And there's like two ways.

513
00:27:49,406 --> 00:27:50,547
One is through exploration.

514
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:54,069
So when you uncover the clouds and there's a PVP node,

515
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,770
we matchmake the opponent there.

516
00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:00,292
And if you clear it, then the node will be empty.

517
00:28:00,772 --> 00:28:05,555
And we can then create new enemies from true invasions.

518
00:28:07,175 --> 00:28:08,196
So what are these invasions?

519
00:28:08,256 --> 00:28:11,698
They are like a way how we spawn enemies on your map

520
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:13,138
or matchmake them on your map.

521
00:28:16,276 --> 00:28:18,476
Okay, this is like a clear challenge with this one,

522
00:28:18,516 --> 00:28:20,697
which is that with the invasion system,

523
00:28:21,457 --> 00:28:23,337
like what's the right tempo for these invasions?

524
00:28:23,938 --> 00:28:25,818
So if let's say you're a really active player

525
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:27,398
and you play the game a lot,

526
00:28:27,798 --> 00:28:29,219
you clear out the map super fast

527
00:28:29,439 --> 00:28:31,459
and then you don't have anything to play basically.

528
00:28:31,999 --> 00:28:34,200
So that's why, but on the other hand,

529
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,340
if you are a player who's more casual

530
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,580
and you play it every now and then,

531
00:28:38,021 --> 00:28:39,961
if you would just like pull the map all the time

532
00:28:40,001 --> 00:28:42,802
with opponents, it might be like too overwhelming.

533
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:49,635
So there's a lot of... it was a super hard problem to make the invasions work in such a way that it kind of pleases everyone.

534
00:28:49,755 --> 00:28:55,179
And it doesn't. I think that is a thing that we can't get to work for everyone optimally.

535
00:28:55,739 --> 00:28:57,841
And we have to make some compromises there.

536
00:28:58,121 --> 00:29:02,304
But we still want to keep the invasion algorithm the same for everyone, because it is a competitive game,

537
00:29:02,604 --> 00:29:05,846
and it would be kind of unfair to change it for different players.

538
00:29:07,205 --> 00:29:10,086
But it is a dynamic in a way that if your map is very empty,

539
00:29:10,106 --> 00:29:11,147
we spawn faster.

540
00:29:11,267 --> 00:29:12,668
And if your map is full of opponents,

541
00:29:12,688 --> 00:29:14,108
then it's going to start slowing down.

542
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,871
And then there's the other problem,

543
00:29:18,891 --> 00:29:21,552
which is that how you actually get rid of these opponents you

544
00:29:21,572 --> 00:29:21,993
can't beat.

545
00:29:22,753 --> 00:29:25,294
And there's an exclamation mark on top of the base.

546
00:29:25,795 --> 00:29:27,656
And this means that the base is something

547
00:29:27,676 --> 00:29:28,816
that you can rematch make.

548
00:29:29,276 --> 00:29:30,697
It breaks the immersion a little bit,

549
00:29:30,717 --> 00:29:33,759
but it was something we needed to include there

550
00:29:34,699 --> 00:29:35,280
to make it work.

551
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:42,514
Okay, how we tie this map to the story out of the world?

552
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:46,717
So it's a kind of unusual setting where each player has their own map

553
00:29:47,298 --> 00:29:53,022
and they are in the center of their map and everyone else are actually like enemies.

554
00:29:53,923 --> 00:29:59,508
So all the other PvP opponents are represented as a part of this evil Blackguard movement

555
00:29:59,928 --> 00:30:01,069
and you are fighting against those.

556
00:30:01,689 --> 00:30:02,750
So you get to be the good guy.

557
00:30:05,062 --> 00:30:07,583
And then these empty nodes, we represented them

558
00:30:07,643 --> 00:30:09,864
as like native villages you try to protect.

559
00:30:10,184 --> 00:30:13,186
So when the invasions comes, they take over these villagers

560
00:30:13,286 --> 00:30:14,847
and you try to protect them.

561
00:30:15,948 --> 00:30:18,209
So it may be weird, but an unusual setting.

562
00:30:22,531 --> 00:30:25,073
OK, next, second topic with BoomBeach,

563
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:27,534
and it is about combat balancing.

564
00:30:28,795 --> 00:30:30,175
And I want to motivate this a little bit.

565
00:30:31,792 --> 00:30:40,074
In Clash of Clans you have a lot of walls and things, but we quite quickly realized that we don't actually want to have walls in Boom Beach.

566
00:30:40,334 --> 00:30:46,876
There are several reasons, and one was that they kind of, how the attacking works with the flares and everything, they just didn't,

567
00:30:47,336 --> 00:30:50,998
and with the one direction of attacking, they just didn't work as well in the combat.

568
00:30:52,158 --> 00:30:59,820
And with that, because they are like a huge amount of content in Clash of Clans and provides this long progression for years, we needed to...

569
00:31:00,445 --> 00:31:01,946
have more content in somewhere else.

570
00:31:02,367 --> 00:31:05,388
So we need to create a lot of upgrade levels for the buildings

571
00:31:05,508 --> 00:31:06,209
and for the troops.

572
00:31:06,849 --> 00:31:09,451
So there's roughly 20 upgrade levels for most

573
00:31:09,491 --> 00:31:10,391
of the troops and buildings.

574
00:31:11,672 --> 00:31:13,973
But now the problem is we have such a big journey,

575
00:31:13,993 --> 00:31:15,154
like how to keep it all balanced.

576
00:31:16,575 --> 00:31:19,737
And so I'm going to explain now some

577
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:20,737
of the things we did there.

578
00:31:22,578 --> 00:31:25,000
So first of all, how the BoomBeats progress works

579
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,401
is that you have your headquarters.

580
00:31:28,142 --> 00:31:28,762
You upgrade that.

581
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:34,481
And it will unlock you new troops, new gunboat abilities,

582
00:31:36,182 --> 00:31:38,522
new defenses, and new landing crafts.

583
00:31:39,182 --> 00:31:42,143
So the landing crafts will fit your troops.

584
00:31:42,543 --> 00:31:43,984
And if you upgrade them and get more,

585
00:31:44,204 --> 00:31:46,665
you will get a bigger army that you can use in attacking.

586
00:31:47,585 --> 00:31:49,786
And the defenses can be, of course, upgraded as well.

587
00:31:50,986 --> 00:31:52,526
And they are tied to the headquarters level.

588
00:31:53,987 --> 00:31:56,888
Now you have an armory, which is a place where you can upgrade

589
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,068
them.

590
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,920
troops and gunboat abilities.

591
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:03,261
And they are all interlocked to the headquarters in a way

592
00:32:03,301 --> 00:32:06,062
that it limits all those max upgrades for each of these.

593
00:32:09,202 --> 00:32:12,323
OK, I'm now going to take an example of Rifleman and Cannon

594
00:32:12,723 --> 00:32:14,843
and quickly show how these work.

595
00:32:15,244 --> 00:32:18,364
So you have level one, and you have some amount of hit points

596
00:32:18,404 --> 00:32:19,545
and damage for those troops.

597
00:32:20,205 --> 00:32:24,646
And level two, it increases, and it goes up to level 20.

598
00:32:24,926 --> 00:32:25,846
Nothing too special here.

599
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,061
Note that these increases are always a percentage.

600
00:32:30,301 --> 00:32:34,102
So you know that each level is a certain amount percentage more

601
00:32:34,142 --> 00:32:35,002
than the previous level.

602
00:32:35,882 --> 00:32:37,383
And they stay the same through the journey.

603
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:42,544
And in a similar way, you have the defenses.

604
00:32:43,024 --> 00:32:44,385
They have some hit points and damage.

605
00:32:45,725 --> 00:32:47,265
And they go up to the level 20.

606
00:32:48,086 --> 00:32:49,806
And here we have also some percentages.

607
00:32:50,106 --> 00:32:50,946
They can be different.

608
00:32:51,046 --> 00:32:53,247
And they are different for different buildings and troops,

609
00:32:53,287 --> 00:32:53,567
actually.

610
00:32:54,925 --> 00:32:57,646
just to make the gameplay work as well as possible.

611
00:33:00,628 --> 00:33:04,191
OK, now we want to have some control of the balance.

612
00:33:04,231 --> 00:33:07,453
We would want to have a map each of these levels

613
00:33:07,673 --> 00:33:09,954
and different troops to certain value.

614
00:33:10,475 --> 00:33:13,376
And for the attacking troops, we call it offensive value.

615
00:33:13,777 --> 00:33:17,719
And for the defensive buildings, we call it a defense value.

616
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,981
So that's the offense value.

617
00:33:21,061 --> 00:33:22,122
And for the riflemen.

618
00:33:23,556 --> 00:33:26,197
The starting, it's kind of like the starting point for everything,

619
00:33:26,277 --> 00:33:28,978
something where you can compare everything against those.

620
00:33:29,339 --> 00:33:32,620
So level one, Rifleman, okay, we just said it's 10.

621
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,461
It's the starting value for that.

622
00:33:35,201 --> 00:33:38,743
Now you can take the cannon and see like how they compare.

623
00:33:39,543 --> 00:33:41,924
So you can say the cannon has certain defense value,

624
00:33:42,745 --> 00:33:46,046
and now you put the Riflemans and all the units play against the cannon,

625
00:33:46,186 --> 00:33:48,567
and just by play testing basically you can see that, okay,

626
00:33:48,607 --> 00:33:49,948
the cannon is six times.

627
00:33:51,001 --> 00:33:52,761
more worth than the rifleman.

628
00:33:52,942 --> 00:33:54,642
So you could place there like a value of 60.

629
00:33:56,884 --> 00:33:59,845
And then you can play the game for the max levels as well

630
00:34:01,006 --> 00:34:03,807
and find out that, OK, the max value has

631
00:34:03,867 --> 00:34:04,848
like offense value roughly 47.

632
00:34:06,048 --> 00:34:08,190
And you know because they go like percent twice

633
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:10,751
for each level, you can be sure that all

634
00:34:10,771 --> 00:34:13,432
the intermediate levels are you can kind of extrapolate

635
00:34:13,452 --> 00:34:14,753
for these two numbers.

636
00:34:15,433 --> 00:34:17,995
And same thing for the max cannon level,

637
00:34:18,475 --> 00:34:19,175
you extrapolate.

638
00:34:20,667 --> 00:34:23,509
and get defense and offense value for all

639
00:34:23,529 --> 00:34:24,430
through the progress.

640
00:34:26,691 --> 00:34:27,932
OK, how we use these.

641
00:34:28,272 --> 00:34:30,593
So there's a few things how we can now use these abstract

642
00:34:30,633 --> 00:34:30,933
values.

643
00:34:33,095 --> 00:34:36,257
First of all, you can try to map the offense-defense balance

644
00:34:36,397 --> 00:34:37,738
through the unlocks.

645
00:34:38,658 --> 00:34:43,941
So this is like a graph where you can, on the x-axis,

646
00:34:43,961 --> 00:34:45,362
you can see headquarter level.

647
00:34:45,662 --> 00:34:48,504
And y-axis, you can see this abstract total power.

648
00:34:48,932 --> 00:34:50,773
in your defenses and in your offenses.

649
00:34:52,214 --> 00:34:55,137
And the lighter blue is the offense,

650
00:34:55,197 --> 00:34:56,718
and the darker is the defense.

651
00:34:57,759 --> 00:35:00,181
This takes into account all the max upgrade levels

652
00:35:00,301 --> 00:35:03,303
at certain, so it's basically more huge spreadsheets, which

653
00:35:03,363 --> 00:35:05,505
takes into account all the upgrade levels that you

654
00:35:05,545 --> 00:35:07,907
can do in any level and all the unlocks.

655
00:35:08,428 --> 00:35:10,409
And if you see, like, OK, the defense value

656
00:35:10,429 --> 00:35:12,331
is dipping too much compared to the offense value

657
00:35:12,371 --> 00:35:14,012
at certain level, we could perhaps

658
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,453
unlock a new building there.

659
00:35:16,855 --> 00:35:19,857
So it helps keeping everything in balance in that regard.

660
00:35:20,197 --> 00:35:23,240
And also note that the offense value starts a bit higher

661
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:27,103
on the early stages, but dips down later.

662
00:35:27,423 --> 00:35:30,986
And that takes into account the skill of the player, which

663
00:35:31,306 --> 00:35:33,027
when you progress through the game,

664
00:35:33,067 --> 00:35:34,228
you learn to play the game better.

665
00:35:34,268 --> 00:35:36,310
So we have to compensate it a little bit in there.

666
00:35:40,966 --> 00:35:43,087
There is this extra challenge with the map

667
00:35:43,287 --> 00:35:46,529
we did, which is that we wanted to have the PvP and NPC

668
00:35:46,689 --> 00:35:47,810
integrated in the same system.

669
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:50,571
And it's easy to get enough content from the PvP side.

670
00:35:50,792 --> 00:35:51,932
You just matchmake peoples.

671
00:35:52,553 --> 00:35:54,514
But on the NPC side, it's harder.

672
00:35:56,995 --> 00:35:59,437
The problem is how to make enough of that content, which

673
00:35:59,477 --> 00:36:01,258
would be in balance for the players.

674
00:36:01,578 --> 00:36:03,159
Not too difficult, not too easy.

675
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:08,322
And creating thousands of levels by hand and balancing them

676
00:36:08,442 --> 00:36:09,162
was not an option.

677
00:36:10,666 --> 00:36:12,887
And by the way, they don't need to be perfect balance,

678
00:36:12,907 --> 00:36:16,008
but having some rough scaling for the NPC levels

679
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:16,528
would be good.

680
00:36:19,169 --> 00:36:22,250
So how the defense value helps here is that, firstly, you

681
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:24,551
can create any level from Level Editor,

682
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:26,952
and then you can get the difficulty automatically.

683
00:36:28,372 --> 00:36:31,874
So with Level Editor, you can do something like this.

684
00:36:32,494 --> 00:36:34,575
And now the question is, OK, how hard this is?

685
00:36:35,275 --> 00:36:37,716
But you can just check the buildings one by one.

686
00:36:38,688 --> 00:36:40,549
Sum the defense values from these buildings.

687
00:36:42,249 --> 00:36:45,511
And then you get the total defense value

688
00:36:45,571 --> 00:36:48,952
for the base, which would be here, 3,562,

689
00:36:50,012 --> 00:36:51,633
which is not the real case.

690
00:36:51,673 --> 00:36:52,593
I just made up the number.

691
00:36:52,633 --> 00:36:53,634
But you get the idea.

692
00:36:56,675 --> 00:37:01,037
And this number now we can use to give some rough idea what's

693
00:37:01,057 --> 00:37:02,977
the base total difficulty.

694
00:37:03,538 --> 00:37:05,498
And we can then match it to the player progress.

695
00:37:06,758 --> 00:37:08,559
And of course, note that the layout affects

696
00:37:08,579 --> 00:37:10,119
the difficulty in practice.

697
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,760
But it will give a rough idea good enough, in a way.

698
00:37:19,301 --> 00:37:21,422
And then you have how we use this also.

699
00:37:21,522 --> 00:37:23,922
And this actually is quite a big part of the game at the moment.

700
00:37:24,062 --> 00:37:26,843
And we use this defense value as a tool to generate levels.

701
00:37:28,063 --> 00:37:30,824
So we pick an existing level that someone made by hand.

702
00:37:32,064 --> 00:37:33,505
We set a target defense value.

703
00:37:34,791 --> 00:37:38,513
which usually is higher than the normal one or the initial one.

704
00:37:39,154 --> 00:37:43,156
And then we have this algorithm that places new defenses,

705
00:37:43,256 --> 00:37:45,598
maybe removes something, upgrades them,

706
00:37:45,738 --> 00:37:47,159
modifies the layout.

707
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:50,381
And we can do those tricks up to the point

708
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:53,082
where we get to the target defense value.

709
00:37:53,342 --> 00:37:56,064
And then, voila, we have an alternate version

710
00:37:56,104 --> 00:37:57,085
of an existing level.

711
00:38:00,287 --> 00:38:02,128
And this defense value was also used to

712
00:38:02,916 --> 00:38:04,836
I don't, I'm not going too deep in here, but like the,

713
00:38:05,437 --> 00:38:08,957
we have these events which are also like fully generated by,

714
00:38:09,157 --> 00:38:13,778
by just algorithms and, uh, there the same thing goes,

715
00:38:13,838 --> 00:38:17,159
but like now, now do not have any existing, like a starting level here.

716
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:20,240
It's just like, it's them, it's them by code,

717
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,681
but there's still like a target defense value and we can control the difficulty

718
00:38:25,101 --> 00:38:27,321
for these events to some extent.

719
00:38:27,381 --> 00:38:32,162
Of course. Okay.

720
00:38:33,421 --> 00:38:35,562
My last game I want to talk about is Brawl Stars.

721
00:38:36,203 --> 00:38:39,705
And it is a game which is in beta still.

722
00:38:40,105 --> 00:38:45,649
And it is an arena action game, kind of like a bit

723
00:38:45,669 --> 00:38:47,530
like a mobile or something, where

724
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:50,832
you have a team versus team battle, three heroes

725
00:38:51,092 --> 00:38:51,653
on one side.

726
00:38:52,313 --> 00:38:55,755
And in the game, you can play different brawlers or heroes.

727
00:38:55,915 --> 00:38:56,616
We call them brawlers.

728
00:39:00,038 --> 00:39:02,720
When starting the project, one of the guiding ideas

729
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:06,135
was that we really believe that people want to play

730
00:39:06,176 --> 00:39:07,336
these type of games on mobile.

731
00:39:08,097 --> 00:39:10,219
But they were kind of the perfect game

732
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:11,980
we felt was missing still.

733
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,863
And we also felt like the session time

734
00:39:15,883 --> 00:39:17,524
should be really, really short.

735
00:39:19,085 --> 00:39:22,768
And these were some of the ideas why we started the project.

736
00:39:24,269 --> 00:39:26,131
Today here, I'm going to talk about two things.

737
00:39:26,551 --> 00:39:28,513
One is about the hero progression.

738
00:39:30,854 --> 00:39:30,955
And

739
00:39:31,738 --> 00:39:33,899
then about how we try to develop the controls.

740
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,742
Okay, what I mean by hero progression?

741
00:39:38,802 --> 00:39:42,564
I mean that we wanted to guarantee that the player has

742
00:39:42,824 --> 00:39:45,085
like an incentive to play all the heroes,

743
00:39:45,905 --> 00:39:46,926
so brawlers, basically.

744
00:39:50,268 --> 00:39:52,789
There's this like a typical problem with these competitive games

745
00:39:52,949 --> 00:39:55,631
and I call it favorite hero problem.

746
00:39:55,651 --> 00:39:58,112
It's a really bad word, but couldn't come up with anything better.

747
00:39:58,532 --> 00:39:59,793
Basically what I mean here is that

748
00:40:00,385 --> 00:40:04,348
You have a scoring which punishes for losing, obviously,

749
00:40:04,388 --> 00:40:05,249
because it's a competitive game.

750
00:40:05,889 --> 00:40:09,352
And it's usually more effective to just

751
00:40:09,372 --> 00:40:12,434
to learn play one hero well, or one deck, whatever

752
00:40:12,474 --> 00:40:12,874
is the game.

753
00:40:15,076 --> 00:40:16,977
And it's also better to concentrate upgrades

754
00:40:17,117 --> 00:40:21,160
on this one single hero, if there are any.

755
00:40:22,141 --> 00:40:24,062
And so you end up sticking with your favorite one.

756
00:40:26,343 --> 00:40:27,104
Why this is a problem?

757
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:31,033
Of course, it's not in a way a big problem.

758
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:32,334
A game can be really fun as well.

759
00:40:32,394 --> 00:40:35,576
But if you bring out new content,

760
00:40:35,696 --> 00:40:38,539
it can feel irrelevant for the new players and all

761
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:39,500
the updates as well.

762
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,422
And also, the other side is that actually, a player

763
00:40:42,482 --> 00:40:44,023
might want to do something else.

764
00:40:44,043 --> 00:40:45,745
They can get bored in these type of games,

765
00:40:45,785 --> 00:40:48,687
because they're kind of locked into this, their favorite thing.

766
00:40:49,228 --> 00:40:50,409
But it's just too risky.

767
00:40:50,549 --> 00:40:52,030
The punishment is too big.

768
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:55,613
So this happens in many games, like I guess in Hearthstone,

769
00:40:56,113 --> 00:40:57,134
many more, like Clash Royale.

770
00:40:57,693 --> 00:40:59,434
You face this similar issue a little bit.

771
00:41:01,214 --> 00:41:06,637
How we tried to address this in Brawl Stars was that we had a,

772
00:41:06,677 --> 00:41:09,638
for each of these heroes, each of these brawlers,

773
00:41:10,699 --> 00:41:12,059
they have their own trophy score,

774
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,000
which is used in the matchmaking.

775
00:41:15,601 --> 00:41:18,663
So you can see, like, here's the trophy score for Brock here.

776
00:41:21,784 --> 00:41:23,525
Then we just, like, we still want

777
00:41:23,565 --> 00:41:25,386
to keep the overall progression for yourself.

778
00:41:26,322 --> 00:41:31,784
And that's just like a sum of all the brawler trophies,

779
00:41:32,565 --> 00:41:33,225
which is shown here.

780
00:41:37,246 --> 00:41:39,967
In addition, there are different game modes and levels

781
00:41:40,307 --> 00:41:41,828
which favor different type of brawlers.

782
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:46,730
So it also pushes you to try to play different brawlers

783
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:48,310
in different events.

784
00:41:50,411 --> 00:41:52,552
An upgrade system makes it hard to concentrate

785
00:41:52,592 --> 00:41:53,392
on just one character.

786
00:41:55,689 --> 00:41:58,570
There's one interesting detail about the trophy progress,

787
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:00,210
which is that it's kind of personal.

788
00:42:00,811 --> 00:42:08,933
And what I mean by that is that your trophy change only

789
00:42:08,973 --> 00:42:10,574
depends on your own trophy score.

790
00:42:11,854 --> 00:42:13,654
So there's this table which tells you

791
00:42:13,694 --> 00:42:15,655
like if you are playing with a certain hero

792
00:42:15,895 --> 00:42:17,276
and it's a certain amount of trophies,

793
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:23,837
you will get a different amount of trophies if you win and lose,

794
00:42:23,938 --> 00:42:24,878
depending on what's your.

795
00:42:25,607 --> 00:42:29,551
personal progress. And the opponent's progress doesn't matter here at all.

796
00:42:29,851 --> 00:42:32,493
So it's not like a zero-sum game in many games.

797
00:42:32,814 --> 00:42:36,497
Zero-sum thing like in LOL, which is used in many games.

798
00:42:36,897 --> 00:42:38,438
If you know it.

799
00:42:41,441 --> 00:42:43,062
Okay, after thoughts about the system.

800
00:42:44,864 --> 00:42:46,485
I think the positive thing is that it can...

801
00:42:47,186 --> 00:42:50,489
It's easy to learn to play a new hero without any stress.

802
00:42:52,092 --> 00:42:53,813
And it creates this fun and fast progress

803
00:42:53,873 --> 00:42:55,013
after unlocking a new hero.

804
00:42:55,033 --> 00:42:57,655
There's no punishment to play a new hero

805
00:42:57,675 --> 00:42:58,616
that you unlocked or gained.

806
00:43:01,157 --> 00:43:04,939
It does add some complexity to the UI, which can be seen

807
00:43:04,979 --> 00:43:06,680
as a downside, I guess.

808
00:43:11,423 --> 00:43:13,344
OK, final topic about Brawl Stars

809
00:43:13,865 --> 00:43:16,066
is how we approach the controls.

810
00:43:16,406 --> 00:43:19,608
And as you see, there's a tiger in the jungle.

811
00:43:22,177 --> 00:43:24,318
So we kind of thought that, OK, yeah, we can do it.

812
00:43:24,338 --> 00:43:24,979
It's a piece of cake.

813
00:43:25,379 --> 00:43:29,041
Well, not a piece of cake, but at least something easy.

814
00:43:29,342 --> 00:43:30,803
Well, not easy, but doable.

815
00:43:32,224 --> 00:43:36,927
But it is a challenging problem to do an action

816
00:43:36,967 --> 00:43:38,008
game on a touch device.

817
00:43:39,469 --> 00:43:41,590
And I'm starting to think that there's no perfect solution

818
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:42,451
for this one, actually.

819
00:43:44,892 --> 00:43:47,594
So the starting point for us was that we

820
00:43:47,634 --> 00:43:49,756
wanted to make an action game which is in landscape.

821
00:43:51,016 --> 00:43:53,717
And the attacking direction would be from left to right.

822
00:43:55,638 --> 00:43:57,298
And how do you control?

823
00:43:57,738 --> 00:43:59,179
Would be by tap to move.

824
00:43:59,619 --> 00:44:02,800
So that's kind of the easiest way to control.

825
00:44:05,301 --> 00:44:07,902
And then the skills would be triggered automatically.

826
00:44:09,062 --> 00:44:11,123
And so by some sub-triggers, basically.

827
00:44:12,684 --> 00:44:14,905
But we quickly rejected this because we

828
00:44:14,945 --> 00:44:16,705
worried that there's not enough depth in the game.

829
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:26,756
Our second try, we kept the same landscape mode and attacking

830
00:44:26,776 --> 00:44:28,917
direction, and we had the tap to move.

831
00:44:30,118 --> 00:44:32,159
So we had a now auto fire, which I

832
00:44:32,199 --> 00:44:36,421
mean that when enemies come close enough in the range,

833
00:44:36,481 --> 00:44:38,602
the character will start shooting automatically.

834
00:44:39,643 --> 00:44:43,385
But then we had skills that can be activated by just tapping

835
00:44:43,445 --> 00:44:45,226
buttons, and then you would have cooldowns there.

836
00:44:47,767 --> 00:44:50,709
We rejected this one as well, and the reason

837
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:51,069
was that.

838
00:44:51,847 --> 00:44:55,409
There's not feeling of having not enough control

839
00:44:55,449 --> 00:44:56,109
for the characters.

840
00:45:00,551 --> 00:45:04,292
Third iteration was a bit similar.

841
00:45:04,632 --> 00:45:07,373
Tap to move, auto fire, and then you

842
00:45:07,393 --> 00:45:09,714
had skills that can be activated and targeted.

843
00:45:10,295 --> 00:45:11,635
So now the targeting is the new thing.

844
00:45:12,115 --> 00:45:15,997
But again, still not enough control, yet lots of stuff

845
00:45:16,037 --> 00:45:16,457
happening.

846
00:45:17,818 --> 00:45:21,439
At this point, we'd figure out, OK, let's think about it

847
00:45:21,459 --> 00:45:21,659
a bit more.

848
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:24,688
There needs to be more control in the shooting part,

849
00:45:24,728 --> 00:45:25,209
especially.

850
00:45:25,649 --> 00:45:27,109
Or it doesn't need to be, but it just

851
00:45:27,129 --> 00:45:28,790
feels natural in this action-type game

852
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:30,590
that you can control the shooting.

853
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:37,152
And we still kept the direction and started prototyping.

854
00:45:38,952 --> 00:45:40,513
And we tried all kinds of things,

855
00:45:40,593 --> 00:45:44,154
like different joystick options, shoot button

856
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:46,795
with auto-targeting, and many others.

857
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:56,321
In the end, after prototyping, some nth iteration,

858
00:45:57,362 --> 00:45:59,982
can't count anymore, we actually end up

859
00:46:00,002 --> 00:46:01,803
with something quite different, which was

860
00:46:02,663 --> 00:46:03,883
you would have a drag to aim.

861
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:07,584
So when you drag the finger, you open up this aiming cone.

862
00:46:10,405 --> 00:46:13,585
And yeah, and now our direction was portrait mode,

863
00:46:13,605 --> 00:46:14,406
which was a big thing.

864
00:46:14,466 --> 00:46:15,866
So we figured out that, OK, let's.

865
00:46:16,299 --> 00:46:19,581
Let's change the portrait because it's a more natural way

866
00:46:19,621 --> 00:46:20,841
to hold your phone.

867
00:46:21,101 --> 00:46:23,983
And the attacking direction became from bottom to top.

868
00:46:25,363 --> 00:46:26,084
So tap to move.

869
00:46:26,904 --> 00:46:28,265
And yeah, that felt pretty good.

870
00:46:28,445 --> 00:46:29,806
We were like, yeah, let's ship it.

871
00:46:30,646 --> 00:46:31,046
This is it.

872
00:46:32,327 --> 00:46:34,848
But we proceeded to company playable.

873
00:46:36,609 --> 00:46:41,311
And just to make sure, we added three different versions

874
00:46:41,351 --> 00:46:41,871
to compare.

875
00:46:43,745 --> 00:46:51,708
and some of the few of those had like so different versions of this and also like a different joystick options and

876
00:46:52,748 --> 00:46:59,710
We got a feedback that like some really preferred the joysticks and some prepared like the control metro we had

877
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:02,431
like a first thought

878
00:47:03,811 --> 00:47:07,552
so it was time to time to go to beta and

879
00:47:09,232 --> 00:47:12,533
How to go there so we decided to go there with two options

880
00:47:15,483 --> 00:47:17,964
First, use the drag to shoot, tap to move.

881
00:47:19,424 --> 00:47:22,305
And then second, have this joystick to move, tap to shoot.

882
00:47:23,525 --> 00:47:26,446
So these two kind of from those playables,

883
00:47:26,506 --> 00:47:27,666
some versions of those.

884
00:47:28,847 --> 00:47:32,068
And then we divide the group of players to A and B group.

885
00:47:32,448 --> 00:47:34,548
And just see, because we honestly

886
00:47:34,568 --> 00:47:36,869
couldn't say what's the best way to play.

887
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:43,171
And yeah, what were the results from this A-B test?

888
00:47:45,369 --> 00:47:49,613
Very interestingly, there was pretty much no clear impact on metrics.

889
00:47:50,354 --> 00:47:53,677
And I think like this is something that's happened over and over again.

890
00:47:53,797 --> 00:47:57,721
Like we actually do very rare, like really AB testing in the company

891
00:47:57,761 --> 00:47:59,363
and especially for the gameplay things.

892
00:47:59,423 --> 00:48:03,146
But when we have done it, it's like usually it's like no clear impact.

893
00:48:03,166 --> 00:48:03,687
So, okay.

894
00:48:04,688 --> 00:48:08,351
And you would assume that something like fundamental as this would show on the metrics.

895
00:48:10,905 --> 00:48:13,046
But we had a possibility for the players

896
00:48:13,066 --> 00:48:16,407
to switch between these two control methods in the game,

897
00:48:16,487 --> 00:48:19,289
because we felt it's kind of fair to give them

898
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:19,969
the possibility.

899
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:23,491
And interestingly, people switched more

900
00:48:23,531 --> 00:48:25,072
to the joystick over time.

901
00:48:26,252 --> 00:48:28,533
And we don't still know exactly the results,

902
00:48:28,593 --> 00:48:30,354
but you can speculate that maybe it's related

903
00:48:30,394 --> 00:48:32,175
that it might be a bit more effective

904
00:48:32,215 --> 00:48:33,136
in some competitive play.

905
00:48:33,556 --> 00:48:35,797
And maybe it's also more familiar for many players

906
00:48:35,857 --> 00:48:39,779
to use this kind of joystick-type control method.

907
00:48:42,417 --> 00:48:44,897
So the decision for the team was to go all into joystick.

908
00:48:45,838 --> 00:48:49,539
And because of that, it made sense

909
00:48:49,579 --> 00:48:53,180
to change the mode to landscape again.

910
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:57,501
But the attacking direction stayed from bottom to up.

911
00:48:59,181 --> 00:49:00,241
And this is how it looks now.

912
00:49:00,421 --> 00:49:02,042
So it's kind of like a dual stick.

913
00:49:02,842 --> 00:49:03,942
It's a very recent update.

914
00:49:04,022 --> 00:49:07,243
And there's been already some iterations on top of that.

915
00:49:07,263 --> 00:49:08,384
But basically, this is it.

916
00:49:08,724 --> 00:49:09,784
So there's a dual stick.

917
00:49:10,362 --> 00:49:13,182
We just have this kind of like a little bit innovation

918
00:49:13,782 --> 00:49:15,383
on joystick side.

919
00:49:15,823 --> 00:49:16,643
We call it trip stick.

920
00:49:18,963 --> 00:49:19,823
It's hard to explain here.

921
00:49:20,304 --> 00:49:21,804
But then we have a joystick for aiming.

922
00:49:22,964 --> 00:49:26,125
And in here, if you drag, you can visualize the aiming.

923
00:49:26,285 --> 00:49:29,105
And if you release, then it shoots.

924
00:49:31,026 --> 00:49:34,126
We have also option for tap to shoot, tap to auto shoot,

925
00:49:34,226 --> 00:49:38,387
which is like a faster way to shoot with auto aim.

926
00:49:39,663 --> 00:49:44,006
And then there's the joystick for the super, which

927
00:49:44,406 --> 00:49:46,387
you release to, in the same way you release to shoot,

928
00:49:46,547 --> 00:49:48,529
and then you can have a possibility

929
00:49:48,549 --> 00:49:49,629
to do the tap to auto shoot.

930
00:49:51,251 --> 00:49:51,511
OK.

931
00:49:53,792 --> 00:49:54,773
So what's next for Brawl?

932
00:49:55,673 --> 00:49:56,114
Who knows?

933
00:49:56,974 --> 00:49:58,635
But we'll keep on exploring.

934
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:05,300
OK, time to wrap it up.

935
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,042
So some conclusion time.

936
00:50:09,644 --> 00:50:14,348
So I kind of made the case that game development can be seen as exploring a jungle

937
00:50:14,908 --> 00:50:18,711
and then in here game designing is about scouting

938
00:50:19,212 --> 00:50:23,756
and then I talk about my adventures in here, in the jungle.

939
00:50:27,819 --> 00:50:32,643
Now, all of these examples have been quite different

940
00:50:33,104 --> 00:50:37,227
but I think there are some general themes between those.

941
00:50:37,932 --> 00:50:41,853
One is that you can use this kind of abstract value as a tool.

942
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:44,194
And it was used in Hay Day and in Boom Beach

943
00:50:44,574 --> 00:50:46,235
to balance the economy and balance the combat.

944
00:50:46,795 --> 00:50:49,396
And it can be like mapping something to an abstract value.

945
00:50:49,416 --> 00:50:50,776
It can be used in many, many ways.

946
00:50:52,957 --> 00:50:55,098
And I think it's good to remember that every jungle is

947
00:50:55,178 --> 00:50:57,979
different, and game development is full of surprises.

948
00:50:58,779 --> 00:51:01,040
And especially if you're innovating and doing

949
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:02,940
new things where you are lacking clear references.

950
00:51:03,815 --> 00:51:05,837
And something that can first look like a really easy

951
00:51:05,897 --> 00:51:07,879
can be actually very difficult in the end.

952
00:51:08,439 --> 00:51:11,601
And a good example is prole stars, for example,

953
00:51:11,642 --> 00:51:12,282
and contrast there.

954
00:51:13,563 --> 00:51:15,404
And a perfect solution on paper might

955
00:51:15,444 --> 00:51:17,546
have unexpected consequences in the end,

956
00:51:18,107 --> 00:51:21,589
as Indy here witnesses when he picks up the statue.

957
00:51:21,609 --> 00:51:24,231
OK.

958
00:51:24,932 --> 00:51:25,232
Thank you.

959
00:51:36,307 --> 00:51:39,569
OK, I think we have some time for questions, if you have any.

960
00:51:44,693 --> 00:51:44,973
Hi there.

961
00:51:46,334 --> 00:51:48,155
It seems like Brawl Stars has been the project

962
00:51:48,175 --> 00:51:50,957
that you've had in beta for the longest.

963
00:51:51,778 --> 00:51:53,539
As a designer, what has it felt like

964
00:51:53,559 --> 00:51:56,481
to make those major iterations whilst the project's actually

965
00:51:56,521 --> 00:51:56,741
live?

966
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:01,740
So I've been actually like, I was in the early development,

967
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:05,001
like a part of that, and then I've been helping other projects,

968
00:52:05,061 --> 00:52:08,562
so I've been only like following the side and helping from outside a little bit.

969
00:52:10,022 --> 00:52:11,342
But I think it was just natural.

970
00:52:11,502 --> 00:52:13,983
Like you try to make the game work as well as you can.

971
00:52:14,243 --> 00:52:18,244
And I don't think Vita is anything like, you know, very different.

972
00:52:18,484 --> 00:52:21,064
You just, you develop it inside the company,

973
00:52:21,084 --> 00:52:23,225
somebody put it out and then you keep on developing

974
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:24,665
and try to make it as best as you can.

975
00:52:24,685 --> 00:52:27,005
So I think it's a natural process of game development.

976
00:52:27,517 --> 00:52:31,060
Right, so you don't feel more pressure on the design decisions?

977
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:34,463
Oh yeah, yeah, of course there is a bit more pressure because they're like a community and

978
00:52:34,523 --> 00:52:39,126
I think community has to be taken into account and it's really valuable also to kind of get

979
00:52:39,166 --> 00:52:44,010
their insights. But I could kind of think that you also you get so much valuable information

980
00:52:44,050 --> 00:52:46,712
there that it helps, but there is definitely more pressure, yes.

981
00:52:46,732 --> 00:52:48,053
Thank you.

982
00:52:48,853 --> 00:52:51,695
Hi, thanks for the jungle metaphor of exploring.

983
00:52:52,522 --> 00:52:56,265
And also for the detailed examples, I was wondering when you start out new projects,

984
00:52:57,766 --> 00:53:02,449
can you start out from the small explorations of a single mechanic, or do you need a high-level

985
00:53:02,469 --> 00:53:03,030
concept first?

986
00:53:03,070 --> 00:53:04,171
What do you do in Supercell?

987
00:53:04,951 --> 00:53:09,414
Yeah, I think it depends, but I think it's good to have some overall idea, like what

988
00:53:09,435 --> 00:53:13,638
you're trying to do, like maybe who would play the game and what type of experience

989
00:53:13,658 --> 00:53:14,158
you're building.

990
00:53:14,458 --> 00:53:16,260
But I think it's a combination.

991
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:20,723
Sometimes you can have some really good idea that you feel that you can build a game on

992
00:53:20,923 --> 00:53:21,363
top of that.

993
00:53:23,076 --> 00:53:28,306
I think still I would say like a big overarching feeling like what type of genre you are doing

994
00:53:28,366 --> 00:53:30,169
and what is maybe the audience for the game.

995
00:53:30,249 --> 00:53:31,912
I think that's still the most important thing.

996
00:53:32,493 --> 00:53:32,794
Thank you.

997
00:53:32,834 --> 00:53:32,974
Yeah.

998
00:53:33,034 --> 00:53:33,194
Yeah.

999
00:53:33,755 --> 00:53:34,436
All right.

1000
00:53:35,110 --> 00:53:38,272
I want to ask, if you can go into more detail

1001
00:53:38,313 --> 00:53:41,074
about the decision of changing the latest changes,

1002
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:44,517
because as you know, Brawl Stars is now the landscape mode,

1003
00:53:44,577 --> 00:53:46,178
and it used to be a portrait mode for long.

1004
00:53:46,858 --> 00:53:48,940
How this decision was made, or what would you

1005
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,721
guess would be a good time estimate for like,

1006
00:53:51,141 --> 00:53:54,824
this is enough time we will try with this try for portrait,

1007
00:53:54,884 --> 00:53:56,285
and now we'll go to landscape because we

1008
00:53:56,305 --> 00:53:58,106
have to change it, or if you go in KPIs.

1009
00:53:58,266 --> 00:53:58,566
Thank you.

1010
00:53:59,147 --> 00:54:04,690
Yeah, OK, so the question was that like, what would

1011
00:54:05,331 --> 00:54:07,533
what was the decision process?

1012
00:54:07,573 --> 00:54:08,894
Yeah, what's the decision process

1013
00:54:08,914 --> 00:54:10,976
and when is basically enough field changing this

1014
00:54:10,996 --> 00:54:12,017
and we'll move to the other?

1015
00:54:13,057 --> 00:54:16,480
I guess it also always depends on how the team feels,

1016
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:17,041
in a way.

1017
00:54:18,382 --> 00:54:19,403
They are doing the decision.

1018
00:54:19,463 --> 00:54:22,685
And yeah, there are many factors to it.

1019
00:54:22,725 --> 00:54:24,467
I don't think you can say you have

1020
00:54:24,487 --> 00:54:25,868
to wait a certain amount of time enough.

1021
00:54:25,988 --> 00:54:28,470
But I think here, the big thing was that realizing that, OK,

1022
00:54:28,490 --> 00:54:29,050
there are many factors to it.

1023
00:54:29,439 --> 00:54:32,161
joystick seems to be how many are playing,

1024
00:54:32,201 --> 00:54:35,222
and then it kind of makes sense to go landscape

1025
00:54:35,242 --> 00:54:37,424
because joystick is more natural in that position.

1026
00:54:37,484 --> 00:54:39,985
And then it kind of escalates to many other changes.

1027
00:54:40,025 --> 00:54:42,526
But yeah, it's kind of organic process, basically.

1028
00:54:42,546 --> 00:54:43,407
Thank you.

1029
00:54:44,768 --> 00:54:45,908
Hey, thanks for your talk.

1030
00:54:46,388 --> 00:54:47,109
A lot of cool stuff.

1031
00:54:47,989 --> 00:54:48,610
You mentioned that.

1032
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:55,022
There was no clear impact on metrics when you A-B tested tab controls and joystick controls.

1033
00:54:55,722 --> 00:55:02,144
But with this new version, you changed the landscape and dual stick controls, but you removed tab controls, right?

1034
00:55:02,304 --> 00:55:02,444
Yeah.

1035
00:55:02,984 --> 00:55:08,046
And was there some impact on metrics, because new players, they are not...

1036
00:55:08,626 --> 00:55:09,887
I don't actually even know, to be honest.

1037
00:55:09,907 --> 00:55:10,427
Okay.

1038
00:55:11,787 --> 00:55:14,028
Probably something, but I don't know even which direction.

1039
00:55:14,308 --> 00:55:15,809
Yeah, so yeah, unfortunately.

1040
00:55:16,129 --> 00:55:16,349
Thanks.

1041
00:55:19,224 --> 00:55:25,826
Hi, my question is, is there a specific reason that you made the conversion between time

1042
00:55:25,866 --> 00:55:27,686
and diamond not linear?

1043
00:55:27,806 --> 00:55:28,667
What's the design goal there?

1044
00:55:28,947 --> 00:55:29,907
Okay, that's a good question.

1045
00:55:30,227 --> 00:55:35,388
I think like, yeah, there is, and mostly, like there's two things to that, I think.

1046
00:55:35,828 --> 00:55:39,990
You can think in such a way that if it would be linear, like a very long production time

1047
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:41,790
would be way too expensive.

1048
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:46,251
But I think the other way to think about it is that you can think there's two types of

1049
00:55:46,331 --> 00:55:47,231
times for the player.

1050
00:55:48,274 --> 00:55:50,556
you are spending when you are actively playing.

1051
00:55:50,936 --> 00:55:52,698
And that's kind of those short session timers.

1052
00:55:53,138 --> 00:55:54,699
And that's more valuable for the players

1053
00:55:55,019 --> 00:55:57,641
than those like, OK, I put the game down and go to sleep

1054
00:55:57,701 --> 00:55:58,502
and it hates hours.

1055
00:55:58,762 --> 00:56:02,445
So it kind of makes sense to value those shorter sessions

1056
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:02,705
more.

1057
00:56:03,726 --> 00:56:04,547
That's how I think about it.

1058
00:56:04,707 --> 00:56:04,947
Thanks.

1059
00:56:06,988 --> 00:56:07,469
Yeah, hi.

1060
00:56:08,029 --> 00:56:08,770
Thanks for the talk.

1061
00:56:10,051 --> 00:56:11,892
Thanks for all those detailed informations.

1062
00:56:12,813 --> 00:56:14,654
I would like to go back to Hay Day

1063
00:56:15,535 --> 00:56:16,536
from the beginning of the talk.

1064
00:56:17,747 --> 00:56:26,531
You mentioned that upgrade warehouses, all those currencies were developed mainly to enhance trading, yes? As far as I remember.

1065
00:56:28,092 --> 00:56:33,594
Before getting this idea, how did you approach warehouse upgrading?

1066
00:56:33,654 --> 00:56:37,036
It was just like normal material?

1067
00:56:37,996 --> 00:56:41,037
With all those experiences, if you would do it the same as you did?

1068
00:56:43,219 --> 00:56:47,302
So would I do it the same way? Would we do it the same way now? I don't know. I think like

1069
00:56:48,142 --> 00:56:54,827
They all came at the same time pretty much. I remember if I remember correctly, so I don't think it so basically the trading and

1070
00:56:55,108 --> 00:56:57,309
Yeah, I can't remember the order

1071
00:56:57,369 --> 00:57:01,272
I think it was pretty much like the same things like locked into place in there at the same time

1072
00:57:01,372 --> 00:57:05,335
So I don't know if what was the actual order of things happening

1073
00:57:06,236 --> 00:57:08,918
Yeah, and I don't know if he would do any changes

1074
00:57:09,916 --> 00:57:13,820
I guess sometimes it can feel a bit too frustrating to upgrade it.

1075
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:15,062
So if there would be some...

1076
00:57:15,982 --> 00:57:17,804
I don't know. That might be something to think about.

1077
00:57:17,904 --> 00:57:22,769
Yeah, because I played Hay Day and it felt quite frustrating to me from time to time

1078
00:57:22,789 --> 00:57:27,634
because I didn't have that many friends playing at the same time.

1079
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:29,276
So it was kind of hard to get by.

1080
00:57:29,376 --> 00:57:32,700
Yeah, I think sometimes it's too hard to do the trading for those upgraded materials.

1081
00:57:33,864 --> 00:57:39,906
how to facilitate that better. I think it works in neighborhoods and it works with friends, but if you don't have that access point, then it is a bit hard.

1082
00:57:40,126 --> 00:57:43,086
I agree. Yeah. Okay. Thanks a lot. Thank you.

1083
00:57:44,187 --> 00:57:44,347
Hey.

1084
00:57:45,187 --> 00:57:49,068
Hey, and thank you very much for your talk. It was

1085
00:57:50,268 --> 00:57:54,849
I start playing Brawl Stars since the like very beginning and I always was wondering

1086
00:57:55,929 --> 00:57:59,950
That hey, these guys are using like two different control systems. So I was thinking that

1087
00:58:01,274 --> 00:58:04,918
Which was the control shared?

1088
00:58:04,998 --> 00:58:08,482
I mean, which option was more popular in players?

1089
00:58:08,662 --> 00:58:11,505
And also I was wondering if you know, like,

1090
00:58:12,747 --> 00:58:16,571
if players that was using one system were better than the other

1091
00:58:16,611 --> 00:58:19,815
or they have higher winner rate or if you check this data or...

1092
00:58:20,195 --> 00:58:20,696
Ah, yeah.

1093
00:58:21,688 --> 00:58:23,549
I don't remember, well, in the beginning, of course,

1094
00:58:24,309 --> 00:58:27,591
the population plays 50-50, because we did the A-B test

1095
00:58:27,631 --> 00:58:28,952
in splitting them to two parts.

1096
00:58:29,613 --> 00:58:32,454
But then it evolved so that more players adapted

1097
00:58:32,474 --> 00:58:34,235
to joystick option, and especially

1098
00:58:34,255 --> 00:58:37,717
into a very high-level players, if I understand correctly.

1099
00:58:37,817 --> 00:58:41,900
And it is, yeah, it might be that it's a bit more effective,

1100
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:45,042
because you can tap so quickly to shoot.

1101
00:58:45,342 --> 00:58:46,943
But yeah.

1102
00:58:47,807 --> 00:58:49,088
That's how it kind of went.

1103
00:58:49,128 --> 00:58:51,168
But I don't actually know even the numbers, to be honest,

1104
00:58:51,408 --> 00:58:52,889
exactly, so I can't say.

1105
00:58:53,749 --> 00:58:54,289
Thank you very much.

1106
00:58:54,309 --> 00:58:57,110
Thank you.

1107
00:58:57,550 --> 00:58:57,810
Hi.

1108
00:58:58,350 --> 00:59:03,571
For the NPC combat generation in Boom Beach,

1109
00:59:04,492 --> 00:59:06,752
you mentioned that there is a method for creating a template

1110
00:59:06,992 --> 00:59:10,613
and moving values until it matches a certain defense value

1111
00:59:10,633 --> 00:59:11,173
that you wanted.

1112
00:59:11,273 --> 00:59:13,954
Is that how you end up doing the entire game?

1113
00:59:14,034 --> 00:59:15,915
Is that all the NPC are based on the templates?

1114
00:59:16,055 --> 00:59:16,115
Or?

1115
00:59:17,034 --> 00:59:20,456
there was some dynamic like just freeform generation that was non-templated?

1116
00:59:20,737 --> 00:59:23,519
Yeah basically like there's uh there's like a pre-made levels there's like

1117
00:59:23,879 --> 00:59:28,463
several hundreds of those actually but uh then those are used as like a templates to

1118
00:59:29,083 --> 00:59:34,728
some player might face like several thousands NPC levels so those are used as the seeds so first

1119
00:59:34,768 --> 00:59:39,311
time you meet them they are like just a basic level but maybe next time you meet it it's kind

1120
00:59:39,331 --> 00:59:43,955
of harder version of some of those earlier levels with some modifications so we kind of use them as

1121
00:59:44,676 --> 00:59:46,057
starting points for the generation.

1122
00:59:46,177 --> 00:59:46,257
OK.

1123
00:59:46,277 --> 00:59:46,397
Yeah.

1124
00:59:46,637 --> 00:59:48,578
Hi.

1125
00:59:48,999 --> 00:59:50,519
My question is going back to Hay Day.

1126
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:54,182
I like how you basically map diamonds to time.

1127
00:59:54,842 --> 00:59:58,204
But then how do you determine how much time certain things

1128
00:59:58,244 --> 00:59:58,624
should be?

1129
00:59:59,365 --> 01:00:02,186
Like, corn should be x, because other things should be y.

1130
01:00:02,547 --> 01:00:04,308
And how do you know that, oh, this

1131
01:00:04,568 --> 01:00:07,229
is costing too much of players' time versus too little?

1132
01:00:07,590 --> 01:00:08,130
It's a good question.

1133
01:00:08,170 --> 01:00:09,671
I think how we approach it, I don't

1134
01:00:09,691 --> 01:00:11,612
think there's any right answer to that.

1135
01:00:12,522 --> 01:00:18,624
That the time is kind of the player experience and we try to make that like how many how much things take time

1136
01:00:18,944 --> 01:00:25,306
It's kind of to optimize the player experience and then they are kind of mapped to these values automatically

1137
01:00:25,567 --> 01:00:29,648
so we we set the times by just so that it feels good and

1138
01:00:30,188 --> 01:00:35,550
But I would say like there's a bit of this trade-off that you want to make some things like a really fast in the progress

1139
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:41,092
like we for example super fast to produce but it kind of causes problem later song a little bit because it's so

1140
01:00:41,558 --> 01:00:48,221
You can so fast to grind it, but it needs to be fast because it's the first crop that you unlock.

1141
01:00:49,602 --> 01:00:50,342
Thank you.

1142
01:00:50,862 --> 01:00:52,203
Also a question about Hay Day.

1143
01:00:53,964 --> 01:00:58,346
Let's say that you figure out that the ingredients for a mission add up to 21 diamonds.

1144
01:00:58,506 --> 01:01:01,947
Do you then give the rewards exactly for 21 diamonds or do you vary it a little bit?

1145
01:01:02,067 --> 01:01:06,009
Because it feels like if you always give exactly the reward that are balanced,

1146
01:01:06,209 --> 01:01:08,430
then it almost doesn't matter for the player which one they pick.

1147
01:01:08,450 --> 01:01:10,151
So the baseline is always the same.

1148
01:01:11,703 --> 01:01:12,864
spice it up a little bit.

1149
01:01:12,884 --> 01:01:15,045
So we have this thing that the XP and coins,

1150
01:01:15,105 --> 01:01:16,726
they are kind of, the balance is shifting.

1151
01:01:16,786 --> 01:01:20,288
So sometimes you can get more XP's from the same order,

1152
01:01:20,448 --> 01:01:22,089
but then you are getting less of coins.

1153
01:01:22,629 --> 01:01:23,650
And then the other way around.

1154
01:01:23,690 --> 01:01:25,931
So there is this kind of randomization on top of that,

1155
01:01:26,011 --> 01:01:27,492
which shifts the balance between.

1156
01:01:27,532 --> 01:01:29,633
But the combined value stays the same.

1157
01:01:30,073 --> 01:01:31,934
And adds kind of flavor to the game in a way.

1158
01:01:32,134 --> 01:01:33,975
I agree, it would be otherwise too dull,

1159
01:01:34,015 --> 01:01:34,976
and that's why we kind of made it.

1160
01:01:35,076 --> 01:01:35,816
Yes, good question.

1161
01:01:36,797 --> 01:01:38,718
Okay, I think we are out of time, so thank you.
