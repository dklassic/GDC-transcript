1
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:45,185
Yeah sure, hello everyone. So, my name is Radek Ratusznik, I am game director of Ghostrunner.

2
00:00:46,486 --> 00:00:53,211
Relax, your implants are still adjusting to the software. I'm in a prison.

3
00:00:53,271 --> 00:00:55,992
Oh, so everything is muted except you, I believe.

4
00:00:56,032 --> 00:00:58,494
You'll have to suffice for now.

5
00:00:58,914 --> 00:01:00,175
A trespasser spotted at metro station.

6
00:01:00,195 --> 00:01:05,859
This is bad. You'll have to fight your way out of here.

7
00:01:08,965 --> 00:01:11,148
The air ducts lead to another sector.

8
00:01:13,251 --> 00:01:15,995
God, your software is a mess.

9
00:01:16,235 --> 00:01:17,858
I've rebooted your acceler-

10
00:01:18,098 --> 00:01:18,499
Hi there.

11
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:21,102
I've rebooted your acceleration module.

12
00:01:46,077 --> 00:01:47,558
The trespasser is in the air duct.

13
00:01:47,598 --> 00:01:48,278
Yeah, yeah, sure. 1, 2, 3, 4.

14
00:01:48,839 --> 00:01:49,499
Guys, can you hear me?

15
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:50,059
Or not?

16
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:50,339
I'm talking.

17
00:01:50,379 --> 00:01:51,080
Initiating the sensory boost.

18
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,220
Focus.

19
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:51,440
Focus.

20
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:51,600
Focus.

21
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:51,780
Focus.

22
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:51,980
Focus.

23
00:01:53,721 --> 00:01:53,881
Focus.

24
00:01:53,941 --> 00:01:54,121
Focus.

25
00:01:54,141 --> 00:01:54,321
Focus.

26
00:01:54,641 --> 00:01:54,741
Focus.

27
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:54,941
Focus.

28
00:01:54,961 --> 00:01:55,141
Focus.

29
00:01:55,161 --> 00:01:55,442
Focus.

30
00:01:55,462 --> 00:01:55,562
Focus.

31
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:55,702
Focus.

32
00:01:55,722 --> 00:01:55,842
Focus.

33
00:01:55,862 --> 00:01:56,002
Focus.

34
00:01:56,062 --> 00:01:56,422
Focus.

35
00:01:57,402 --> 00:01:57,503
Focus.

36
00:01:57,523 --> 00:01:57,643
Focus.

37
00:01:57,663 --> 00:01:57,783
Focus.

38
00:01:57,803 --> 00:01:58,043
Focus.

39
00:02:02,091 --> 00:02:08,554
Oh, I see. I was still muted because I'm still getting used to my new setup.

40
00:02:08,654 --> 00:02:14,557
Oh my god. Okay. I'm gonna restart the- that was all me. That was all user error. Okay.

41
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:18,598
Uh, hi everyone. Back to the start of the demo. Let's pretend that didn't happen.

42
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:23,120
My name is Brian Francis. I work at GDC and a little website called Gamasutra.

43
00:02:23,581 --> 00:02:26,722
Um, let's start the introduction again. Raddick, take us from the top. How you doing?

44
00:02:28,825 --> 00:02:34,309
Thank you. Hi everyone. My name is Radek Ratusznik. I am game director of Ghostrunner.

45
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,772
Yeah, and together with me we've got a couple of developers.

46
00:02:39,674 --> 00:02:46,179
So yeah, I'm Damian or Damian and I work as a 3D lead artist at One More Level.

47
00:02:48,461 --> 00:02:52,445
Hello, my name is Marcin and I am lead of the designer at One More Level.

48
00:02:54,654 --> 00:02:58,995
Hello there, my name is Jan and I'm the narrative designer and writer for Ghostrunner.

49
00:02:59,995 --> 00:03:03,155
Looks like we have a pretty active chat today. Chat, I can see your stuff.

50
00:03:03,876 --> 00:03:06,456
I did turn down the audio levels for you for the game.

51
00:03:07,276 --> 00:03:10,397
We're gonna be taking your questions and asking them for the folks on Ghostrunner.

52
00:03:10,677 --> 00:03:12,138
No, we are not doing speed tech.

53
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:17,759
You are about to watch someone who was playing the game for the first time is gonna die about precisely 17 times.

54
00:03:18,619 --> 00:03:21,040
I know that number because it shows up at the end of the demo.

55
00:03:21,792 --> 00:03:28,573
But yeah, if you have any questions, we're happy to pass them on to the team and we're here to talk about the making of Ghostrunner, which comes out very soon.

56
00:03:28,593 --> 00:03:35,654
Alright, Radek, what are we looking at here? Like, why did you and your team want to make Ghostrunner?

57
00:03:36,514 --> 00:03:39,035
And how did this game sort of get started?

58
00:03:40,255 --> 00:03:41,415
Sure, so...

59
00:03:41,915 --> 00:03:46,096
Obviously we are looking at you dying a lot of times.

60
00:03:46,716 --> 00:03:47,736
Oh yeah, get ready for that.

61
00:03:47,776 --> 00:03:48,216
Besides that...

62
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:56,499
Yeah, so our previous title called God's Trigger, it was a game which we developed in Unity,

63
00:03:56,899 --> 00:04:03,860
and it was a top-down action co-op game, heavily inspired by Hotline Miami, so it was also one hit,

64
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:10,941
one kill, that mechanic which is also here, like in Ghostrunner. This is like the core mechanic

65
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:17,803
of our game. So we decided to, you know, to push to a little bit, to something new, that we wanted

66
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:18,323
to make.

67
00:04:19,275 --> 00:04:22,977
take this one-hit-one-kill mechanic and deliver the game

68
00:04:24,337 --> 00:04:26,458
which will be kind of different.

69
00:04:26,518 --> 00:04:31,160
So we put it to another perspective, to the first-person perspective,

70
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:37,462
which is something new for us because we haven't done any first-person game before.

71
00:04:37,842 --> 00:04:43,664
We've also switched to the Unreal Engine 4, which was also totally new for us

72
00:04:43,824 --> 00:04:47,245
because it was the first game for many of us on this engine.

73
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:56,229
We are lucky that Damian, our 3D artist who is today with us, he's amazing in Unreal.

74
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:01,791
And that was also our main decision, that we wanted to push that visuals to the next level.

75
00:05:02,492 --> 00:05:10,194
To one more level, let's say. But yeah, so what we wanted to do is to, you know, bring the new

76
00:05:10,254 --> 00:05:14,776
quality to that, to our team, that we wanted to have like...

77
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:23,734
A nice, very nice looking game with this kind of indie creative vision that we are, you know,

78
00:05:25,095 --> 00:05:30,658
it's not like a AAA game in terms of gameplay, in terms of what you are doing actually in the game.

79
00:05:32,683 --> 00:05:34,884
We are free to do what we want to do.

80
00:05:34,944 --> 00:05:42,588
We wanted to make that one-hit-one-kill mechanic something unique to that mechanic.

81
00:05:42,828 --> 00:05:45,910
That was our main goal, I think, at least at the very beginning.

82
00:05:46,711 --> 00:05:48,652
But at the very, very beginning, it was just,

83
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:53,314
let's make a first-person game on Unreal Engine in a cyberpunk theme.

84
00:05:54,095 --> 00:05:57,676
So that was our premise, let's say, at the very beginning.

85
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:03,744
Yeah, right on. We can talk more about Ghostrunner's cyberpunk vibe and world in a bit.

86
00:06:04,184 --> 00:06:06,245
Damian, I want to spin to you as a level designer.

87
00:06:07,126 --> 00:06:10,688
Something I said before this meeting started, and you're seeing me horribly reflect it,

88
00:06:11,388 --> 00:06:14,551
what I think is interesting about 1 hit 1 kill is it means that even combat...

89
00:06:15,011 --> 00:06:17,592
I wouldn't say there's combat in this game, there's just platforming.

90
00:06:18,513 --> 00:06:20,895
And every one that you kill is just sort of like...

91
00:06:21,235 --> 00:06:24,837
They're just a little platform that you have to reach in order to achieve your goal.

92
00:06:24,857 --> 00:06:27,619
They just have to be positioned a certain way, and they're trying to kill you.

93
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:32,180
Um, uh, what was your, like, experience making levels for this game?

94
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,541
Because I've played a little bit more of it.

95
00:06:33,581 --> 00:06:35,761
I won't be able to discuss much more of what I've played.

96
00:06:36,141 --> 00:06:40,002
But I wanted to, uh, hear from you, like, what was your experience making levels

97
00:06:40,542 --> 00:06:44,683
where, you know, like, like I said, where it fits the platforming and where enemies

98
00:06:44,723 --> 00:06:47,364
are positioned in such a way that they guide players through these pretty high

99
00:06:47,404 --> 00:06:51,065
velocity situations without, uh, losing track of the situation.

100
00:06:51,165 --> 00:06:54,346
As you will see me lose track of the situation, but that's not your fault.

101
00:06:54,386 --> 00:06:54,826
That's mine.

102
00:06:57,386 --> 00:07:01,468
Yes, that's the... sorry, that's the question for Marcin.

103
00:07:01,508 --> 00:07:03,650
Marcin, I'm so sorry Damien, I'm so sorry.

104
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:08,473
Yeah, it's okay, actually the topic is connected actually.

105
00:07:09,033 --> 00:07:12,956
Damien can elaborate on the visual side and guide you later.

106
00:07:13,496 --> 00:07:14,337
More on that side, but...

107
00:07:15,695 --> 00:07:22,577
Designing the levels, yes. So as Radek said, our previous game was Sleeker and also was 1v1 kill.

108
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:26,698
So as designers we had plenty of experience designing that kind of game.

109
00:07:27,438 --> 00:07:29,838
To be fair, to guide the player in the right way.

110
00:07:30,538 --> 00:07:33,079
So, actually to the details maybe, you know.

111
00:07:33,739 --> 00:07:44,101
We made sure that everything that is of interest to the player, like where to go and what to do, is mostly in front of you.

112
00:07:44,661 --> 00:07:50,005
You don't have to look around that much and you make split-second, moment-to-moment decisions

113
00:07:50,605 --> 00:07:55,048
seeing those things, like you see the next enemy, you see the next highlighted platforms,

114
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:58,230
like highlighted here in yellow, as you can see.

115
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:03,274
Like this is one of the main colors that guides, you know, the wallruns are yellow.

116
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:11,453
And how much time passes before the enemy shoots is indicated by the particle.

117
00:08:11,994 --> 00:08:14,074
So maybe I'm elaborating on that.

118
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:22,818
Also, when thinking about the space, I was thinking, and every designer is thinking about the movement.

119
00:08:24,348 --> 00:08:30,352
This is one jump, this is one slide, this is one dodge.

120
00:08:30,412 --> 00:08:34,615
Thinking about what's the moveset to pass through this space.

121
00:08:35,435 --> 00:08:38,437
It's like this specific space requires this and this.

122
00:08:39,798 --> 00:08:42,900
Instinctively, we connect those spaces with the tutorials,

123
00:08:43,001 --> 00:08:45,022
so we don't stop the player too much.

124
00:08:45,122 --> 00:08:47,584
Everything is, I think, fluid in that regard.

125
00:08:48,785 --> 00:08:56,531
Yeah, and basically also taking inspirations from other games like Doom, Titanfall, Windows Edge,

126
00:08:56,851 --> 00:09:02,035
you know, all the good stuff that works and mixing it in with the things we know.

127
00:09:03,196 --> 00:09:05,337
Yeah, so basically that's the gist of it.

128
00:09:06,248 --> 00:09:10,749
Yeah, this space is interesting that I'm running through right now, as you can see in this footage.

129
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:15,131
This is where the game starts to open up and give players more choices.

130
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,272
As you can see the curved wall I'm about to run on.

131
00:09:17,352 --> 00:09:21,253
Like you said, players have some tunnel vision in this game that keeps them pushing forward.

132
00:09:21,553 --> 00:09:23,774
How do you still help them move?

133
00:09:23,954 --> 00:09:27,675
They're essentially doing this in a bunch of cubes, maybe they're long rectangles.

134
00:09:27,715 --> 00:09:31,536
But how do you help players get that comfort in that motion?

135
00:09:31,636 --> 00:09:33,597
How do we place...

136
00:09:34,397 --> 00:09:39,302
In the vision of the player, there are points of interest.

137
00:09:39,362 --> 00:09:42,144
You see the yellow signs.

138
00:09:42,205 --> 00:09:45,448
You see the highlighted spaces.

139
00:09:46,849 --> 00:09:49,271
Here you can see the grapples. You look for the next grapple.

140
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:52,094
You look for the next enemy. You hear the sounds.

141
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:58,243
And it's just, you know, a lot of testing too, actually.

142
00:09:58,303 --> 00:10:02,024
It's not just that you think it through and make a level and that's it.

143
00:10:02,544 --> 00:10:12,427
Actually, this particular level, we were making many, many iterations before you were playing what we see here.

144
00:10:13,388 --> 00:10:14,528
A lot of iterations.

145
00:10:14,768 --> 00:10:17,549
A lot of iterations, actually.

146
00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:19,329
I lost count, actually.

147
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:27,372
So, getting a lot of playtests, listening to feedback and looking at the players, what they actually do and where they look.

148
00:10:28,892 --> 00:10:37,994
As you can see, I know that they are not lost and do what's supposed to be done here and go where they are.

149
00:10:39,536 --> 00:10:45,342
supposed to go and to be fair in the game so it's not vanishing for you when you die

150
00:10:45,422 --> 00:10:49,086
you replace a lot of checkpoints that comes from the experience from making previous games

151
00:10:49,406 --> 00:10:53,630
a lot of checkpoints between obstacles in between combat spaces

152
00:10:55,003 --> 00:10:58,687
makes you not regret dying.

153
00:10:58,967 --> 00:11:01,249
Dying is a part of the main loop of the game.

154
00:11:01,289 --> 00:11:03,932
So you have the enemy placement, if you don't see them,

155
00:11:04,272 --> 00:11:06,835
you know, ah, there's a guy, ok, next time I know he's there.

156
00:11:07,175 --> 00:11:08,737
You see, it's in the first time.

157
00:11:09,738 --> 00:11:17,102
If the level is more open, we tend to use objective markers, as you saw in the previous arena.

158
00:11:17,962 --> 00:11:20,824
That's extra help for guiding the player.

159
00:11:20,864 --> 00:11:22,564
That's like the easy way to go.

160
00:11:22,584 --> 00:11:29,248
Yeah, that's the cheap way out, but mostly trying to funnel in the most important information.

161
00:11:30,288 --> 00:11:35,731
Yeah, but you know, it's also important that we have those instant restarts,

162
00:11:35,831 --> 00:11:37,412
which is like, you can immediately...

163
00:11:39,664 --> 00:11:44,669
come back to the action right after dying. So we are not breaking the loop. It's like the part of

164
00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:49,734
the loop as mentioned, as Marcin mentioned before, that you are dying but it's we are not punishing

165
00:11:49,774 --> 00:11:55,179
the player. It's like a part of the learning how to play this game and you are getting better and

166
00:11:55,239 --> 00:11:58,122
better. So that was our our design for this.

167
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,704
It's the same as we did on God's Trigger.

168
00:12:02,084 --> 00:12:04,425
It's inspired by Hotline Miami, of course.

169
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,586
You are with this tension.

170
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:10,247
We are not breaking the music, for example, in the background.

171
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,528
It's playing constantly.

172
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:14,089
So you feel that it's like...

173
00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:15,889
Sometimes you can...

174
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:21,131
If you are fast enough, you can just press R for restart

175
00:12:21,231 --> 00:12:25,493
without even seeing this dev screen, for example.

176
00:12:26,133 --> 00:12:27,033
So, yeah.

177
00:12:28,022 --> 00:12:35,168
Right on. Before, I would love to ping Damian and Jan for some questions, but I do want to get a question from chat.

178
00:12:35,949 --> 00:12:40,453
All I want to hear in chat is praising Kevin. I don't know who Kevin is. I haven't met Kevin yet.

179
00:12:41,013 --> 00:12:45,517
LucholanGD would like to ask, what were some of the challenges creating the game?

180
00:12:45,797 --> 00:12:52,904
And I'd like to invite each of you to share one specific challenge you remember that you would like to talk about with folks.

181
00:12:52,944 --> 00:12:54,785
So, like, that represent each of your fields.

182
00:12:57,139 --> 00:12:58,661
So I can start I think.

183
00:12:59,722 --> 00:13:04,107
So for me, as I'm also leading the whole team of 1MoreLevel,

184
00:13:04,508 --> 00:13:07,992
it was the process of switching to the new engine.

185
00:13:08,973 --> 00:13:13,198
That was easier than I thought, but it was hard.

186
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:13,898
It was like...

187
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,561
Not everyone were...

188
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:21,453
you know, sure that it's the right move, that maybe we should make another game in Unity,

189
00:13:21,533 --> 00:13:27,958
maybe we shouldn't jump to Unreal Engine 4 right away, but it was a good decision for us because

190
00:13:27,978 --> 00:13:34,423
it really works well for us, so that was a hard decision, but we had to make it.

191
00:13:36,925 --> 00:13:41,068
Um, uh, who's next? Uh, Damian, what was your biggest challenge?

192
00:13:42,653 --> 00:13:48,274
Yeah, so yeah, I guess the whole game is something new for us.

193
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:51,055
It's totally different from our previous title.

194
00:13:51,175 --> 00:13:54,396
It's a totally new perspective, totally new art style,

195
00:13:54,896 --> 00:13:59,956
totally different set of the tools that everyone on the team needed to learn, obviously.

196
00:14:00,777 --> 00:14:07,638
We are a fairly small team and the game for that kind of a small team is very ambitious

197
00:14:07,678 --> 00:14:10,978
and there is plenty of locations and interesting environments.

198
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:16,664
Also different sets of assets for different areas.

199
00:14:16,684 --> 00:14:23,351
So it was very challenging for us to get through the design process

200
00:14:24,051 --> 00:14:27,114
and the process of creation of all the art assets,

201
00:14:28,276 --> 00:14:30,938
all the set dressing.

202
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:33,501
Like I said, we are a very small team.

203
00:14:35,863 --> 00:14:43,550
I guess we did pretty good on that front and even to this day we're still tweaking stuff.

204
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:51,617
Obviously, like Marcin said, we put a lot of, as a team, a lot of work to make sure the gameplay is well.

205
00:14:51,697 --> 00:14:57,262
And this is definitely a gameplay-first title, so all the visuals serve to improve the gameplay.

206
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:02,105
to make all the action very well readable,

207
00:15:03,006 --> 00:15:06,088
so you never get stuck in the levels.

208
00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:08,550
So this is definitely a challenge.

209
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:12,953
You have to consider all the lighting in the scene,

210
00:15:13,073 --> 00:15:15,735
all the assets you place around the path of the player.

211
00:15:16,255 --> 00:15:19,317
And yeah, we still also...

212
00:15:19,558 --> 00:15:21,219
This is not my part,

213
00:15:21,859 --> 00:15:25,602
but as a team of people focusing on the visuals,

214
00:15:25,642 --> 00:15:26,643
we still want to...

215
00:15:28,004 --> 00:15:33,673
So this is also a challenge in this kind of a game where you definitely don't want to

216
00:15:33,693 --> 00:15:34,254
stop the player.

217
00:15:36,434 --> 00:15:40,537
Marcin, let's start with you. What was one of your biggest challenges?

218
00:15:40,597 --> 00:15:44,999
I totally agree with the previous points that Guy said.

219
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:49,422
I can elaborate on the story part a bit.

220
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:53,344
When designing the levels we were keeping in mind what was the dialogue there.

221
00:15:53,544 --> 00:15:56,246
Basically, as we talked about before the stream,

222
00:15:58,038 --> 00:16:03,880
is fluid, so there's time for combat, there's time for parkour, there's time for exposition,

223
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:11,002
so you can breathe, it's not just frantic action all the time, and making the game fair,

224
00:16:12,943 --> 00:16:20,606
as we were talking, fluid where to go, so it's easy and fun to play where it has to be,

225
00:16:21,026 --> 00:16:22,246
where it has to be, and

226
00:16:27,588 --> 00:16:33,950
Well, that was maybe the hard part, to my field of more specifics.

227
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:47,155
Designing maybe boss fights was a bit challenging, because one hit mechanic makes it a bit challenging to design, but I think they turned out pretty well.

228
00:16:47,175 --> 00:16:51,516
That's one thing. Maybe the other thing would be to...

229
00:16:54,573 --> 00:17:01,183
You know, to make the game as fun as possible, as cool as possible, you know, and keeping

230
00:17:01,484 --> 00:17:05,690
everything fresh, you know, because as you play the game, something pops up.

231
00:17:06,351 --> 00:17:10,036
So that was the challenge, to make it all, you know, come together as maybe...

232
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:11,919
Right on.

233
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:17,763
And also upgrading system, that was something which we have, like, you know, how can you

234
00:17:18,244 --> 00:17:21,506
upgrade your character when you've got only one health point.

235
00:17:21,686 --> 00:17:24,989
That was also some kind of design challenge for our gameplay designers.

236
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:36,081
Maybe if I can add, because there are no programmers with us, I could say that making the game snappy, as Radik said, like the respawn is instant.

237
00:17:36,461 --> 00:17:41,547
To those of them for making it fluid, what you can see is the effect of the hard work, the whole team.

238
00:17:48,357 --> 00:17:50,758
Right on. I want to give Yon a chance to weigh in.

239
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:54,100
Yon, obviously we haven't even gotten to talk about that ghost runner.

240
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,600
It takes place in a pretty unique world.

241
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,302
You've got this tower that's like the last bastion of humanity.

242
00:17:59,102 --> 00:17:59,962
What was your sort of...

243
00:18:00,362 --> 00:18:02,203
We're in a very narrative set piece right now actually.

244
00:18:02,243 --> 00:18:03,964
So what was your biggest challenge?

245
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:11,108
Basically, Damian already named my biggest challenge because the game is very much about

246
00:18:11,188 --> 00:18:11,928
gameplay first.

247
00:18:12,248 --> 00:18:17,291
So how to implement a story into the game that's all about staying in motion and rushing

248
00:18:17,351 --> 00:18:17,631
ahead.

249
00:18:18,271 --> 00:18:25,195
So in a way there's a limited amount of tools you can use to deliver a story in games such

250
00:18:25,275 --> 00:18:25,635
as this.

251
00:18:25,935 --> 00:18:30,918
Because there's not really time to stand around, to listen to people talk, to read things.

252
00:18:31,758 --> 00:18:37,683
Basically, you want to focus on delivering a story that's, you know, engaging in a way

253
00:18:37,803 --> 00:18:40,986
that will grip you even during a fight, during traversing the levels.

254
00:18:41,726 --> 00:18:47,151
So Martin mentioned the pacing, that there is some place for the fighting, some place

255
00:18:47,191 --> 00:18:52,475
for platforming, some place for delivery of the exposition, and I think it came together.

256
00:18:53,095 --> 00:19:00,117
really well, if I do say so myself, and I definitely can praise Martin and other level designers for delivering the great pacing.

257
00:19:00,997 --> 00:19:11,999
But for me, it was, you know, the overall shape of the story, for it to stand on its own legs and to be able to be delivered in this fashion during the running, basically.

258
00:19:12,019 --> 00:19:19,440
Because most of the interactions you have with the characters is not face-to-face. Basically, they are just voices in your head.

259
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:26,125
So also writing the dialogue in a way that it's engaging and it's, you know, it delivers the

260
00:19:26,185 --> 00:19:31,710
exposition in a way that feels natural and it feels fun and complements the action instead of

261
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:36,914
getting in the way of the action. I think that's the best way to put it. How to make the story,

262
00:19:37,474 --> 00:19:44,560
you know, stand on its own merit but complement the action instead of getting in the way.

263
00:19:45,905 --> 00:19:49,166
Uh, guys, I just want to say, by the way, chat is incredibly hype for this game.

264
00:19:49,186 --> 00:19:53,728
Whenever we get to, you know, have a games community in the chat, you know, it's always fun and exciting,

265
00:19:53,908 --> 00:19:58,129
you know, when they're, when folks who love the game pop in, but these, these folks who are watching with us today are,

266
00:19:58,149 --> 00:20:01,490
uh, just talking about how excited for they are when this thing, when it comes out.

267
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:07,672
They're actually also talking about, um, speedrunning, which is a really fun conversation we can move to,

268
00:20:07,712 --> 00:20:09,753
which, uh, kind of affects all of your work.

269
00:20:09,993 --> 00:20:10,053
Um...

270
00:20:11,354 --> 00:20:13,436
Speedrunning is a different kind of way to play a game.

271
00:20:13,676 --> 00:20:17,600
It's about efficiency, it's about skips, it's about runs and percentages.

272
00:20:18,941 --> 00:20:25,266
And I'm curious what your experience was prepping this game and sort of going,

273
00:20:25,446 --> 00:20:27,989
oh, hey, this might appeal to the speedrunning community,

274
00:20:28,069 --> 00:20:30,611
but we don't want to make them the only people who can play our game.

275
00:20:31,131 --> 00:20:33,834
Do you have any thoughts about building games that are popular with that crowd?

276
00:20:36,156 --> 00:20:37,617
So, yeah, so it was like...

277
00:20:38,555 --> 00:20:42,377
We knew that this game had potential for speedrunners.

278
00:20:42,897 --> 00:20:45,038
Just like our previous one, God's Trigger,

279
00:20:46,419 --> 00:20:52,062
there was also some potential in terms of speedrunning.

280
00:20:52,102 --> 00:20:56,685
Whereas Ghostrunner, when we first showed it up on last Gamescom,

281
00:20:56,725 --> 00:20:59,626
last year, it was Gamescom 2019,

282
00:21:00,367 --> 00:21:02,868
that was the place where we showed the game for the first time.

283
00:21:03,188 --> 00:21:05,530
And there were a few guys who were just...

284
00:21:06,981 --> 00:21:12,962
Over all the time they were just you know coming by and playing the levels and they were starting to you know

285
00:21:13,943 --> 00:21:15,503
putting their own phones and

286
00:21:16,003 --> 00:21:18,264
recording their times and stuff like that

287
00:21:18,724 --> 00:21:23,565
And when we were looking at them when they in like they were playing like five or six times

288
00:21:24,245 --> 00:21:28,166
In a row through the game and we we saw that oh my god

289
00:21:28,206 --> 00:21:31,927
They are starting to be better players than we are of our own game

290
00:21:32,987 --> 00:21:34,888
That was the moment when we knew oh my god

291
00:21:36,196 --> 00:21:37,597
This is the potential for this game.

292
00:21:37,637 --> 00:21:40,198
And after releasing the demo on Steam,

293
00:21:41,158 --> 00:21:44,619
where the community of speedrunners showed up

294
00:21:44,699 --> 00:21:46,720
and they really enjoyed the game,

295
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,161
they gave us very valuable feedback,

296
00:21:51,382 --> 00:21:54,283
we knew that this is something we should work with.

297
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,601
They found their own tactics on how to move our character

298
00:22:02,022 --> 00:22:05,183
and we didn't want to remove it from the game or fix it

299
00:22:05,543 --> 00:22:09,384
because they really enjoyed it and at the same time we were trying to use

300
00:22:09,444 --> 00:22:12,506
their own techniques when we were playing, when we were testing the game

301
00:22:12,866 --> 00:22:17,108
and we at the same time we were really enjoying it too so that was a new way

302
00:22:17,568 --> 00:22:22,450
of playing the game. Right now we are also pretty good at speed running this game.

303
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:23,270
Oh that's fun!

304
00:22:24,351 --> 00:22:24,611
Yeah.

305
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:31,752
Uh, Damien and Marcin, okay, so real quick guys, so the demo, uh, I've got, uh, we're just gonna look at the menu here for a couple seconds, it's a beautiful menu,

306
00:22:32,013 --> 00:22:35,653
and then you know what, we're having a good conversation, I'm gonna run the demo back to the start,

307
00:22:36,053 --> 00:22:40,894
folks like Cube Zero in chat are asking who plays the demo five or six times in a row, guess what, it's gonna be us today!

308
00:22:41,294 --> 00:22:46,015
Except, I'm not playing it, this is pre-recorded footage, cause it's really hard to play games and talk to people at the same time.

309
00:22:46,455 --> 00:22:51,636
Um, Damien and Marcin, after, after experiencing that, you know, watching people speedrun just your demo...

310
00:22:53,859 --> 00:22:57,042
Oh my god, MetaLive says they're sitting here with 70 hours in the demo.

311
00:22:58,724 --> 00:23:00,106
So I hope y'all are excited about that.

312
00:23:00,126 --> 00:23:01,267
But yeah, what's your experience?

313
00:23:01,327 --> 00:23:04,731
Like, okay, now you know this is sort of how some people might play your game,

314
00:23:04,771 --> 00:23:07,474
and it's a very high level, very different from the average play.

315
00:23:07,514 --> 00:23:09,917
How did that impact your work as you got ready to finish this game?

316
00:23:11,763 --> 00:23:13,625
Yeah, so maybe I'll start.

317
00:23:13,865 --> 00:23:19,852
So yeah, definitely there was a lot of unexpected ways to complete the game, at least demo,

318
00:23:20,212 --> 00:23:22,875
that I noticed when watching people playing the game.

319
00:23:25,478 --> 00:23:31,405
So it definitely changed the way we're thinking about addressing the levels, how we approach.

320
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:36,528
approach, thinking about the paths the player may take.

321
00:23:36,588 --> 00:23:39,710
We definitely try to waterproof kind of the level,

322
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:44,793
so the player can not, or can, but it's more in a designed way,

323
00:23:45,793 --> 00:23:48,695
go through different route for example.

324
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:56,619
Yeah, so we obviously pay more attention to details like that.

325
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,201
I'm not really sure, it's kind of a...

326
00:24:00,782 --> 00:24:04,944
affected the way we construct the visuals.

327
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:13,568
I guess when someone tries to get the best time on a particular level,

328
00:24:13,748 --> 00:24:20,632
they're not really interested about the visuals when they replay the level for a hundred times.

329
00:24:20,752 --> 00:24:27,235
So yeah, we still try to make the game appealing to every player.

330
00:24:29,157 --> 00:24:32,000
So you don't have to worry about that if you're not speedrunning.

331
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:38,665
But I'm sure that there's not much that will get in your way if you try to get the best score.

332
00:24:38,925 --> 00:24:48,173
Like we said before, this is a gameplay-first game, so you don't find stuff that constantly blocks you.

333
00:24:48,514 --> 00:24:55,519
So yeah, I would say it's a very speedrun-friendly game, definitely.

334
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:05,155
Yeah, we are trying to fix some out of bounds bugs, but not like something on the main road.

335
00:25:05,195 --> 00:25:12,019
But, you know, we won't manage to close it all. It's like, it's impossible.

336
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:16,482
People are always trying to find a way.

337
00:25:16,983 --> 00:25:19,204
So maybe I can elaborate more about that.

338
00:25:19,344 --> 00:25:23,847
As Alex said, we were in contact with the planning community actually.

339
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:32,414
When we were designing the levels, we were thinking about ways you can play them faster.

340
00:25:32,814 --> 00:25:39,159
It's not just about being a speedrunner, it's just about you can figure out a bit of shortcuts,

341
00:25:39,259 --> 00:25:42,101
it's not like a major shortcut, but you can do this.

342
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:48,065
And yeah, we were thinking about it.

343
00:25:49,086 --> 00:25:52,048
And also, as Damian said, this is a game...

344
00:25:52,905 --> 00:25:59,047
Not only for speedrunners, if you are not running around doing out of bounds stuff,

345
00:25:59,487 --> 00:26:01,268
I think you will enjoy it too.

346
00:26:02,028 --> 00:26:09,190
And yeah, we were very surprised and very happy about the result the demo gave us.

347
00:26:09,611 --> 00:26:13,752
Plenty of feedback, also plenty of things to think about.

348
00:26:15,187 --> 00:26:20,055
So yeah, we were thinking about making the levels appealing to many people, actually.

349
00:26:20,837 --> 00:26:21,718
Not just speedrunners.

350
00:26:31,092 --> 00:26:32,853
I saw him and in my head I said,

351
00:26:32,933 --> 00:26:34,694
Hi Kevin, I just had to let you finish your thought.

352
00:26:35,514 --> 00:26:41,077
So what is a skip that you obviously want to patch out?

353
00:26:41,357 --> 00:26:42,617
And what is a skip that you think,

354
00:26:42,837 --> 00:26:43,858
Oh, we should let that stay in.

355
00:26:43,878 --> 00:26:46,479
There's actually a little skip that I developed for myself.

356
00:26:46,499 --> 00:26:50,261
You'll see it later on now that we're running back through the footage again.

357
00:26:50,561 --> 00:26:52,161
There's a point where you're supposed to grapple

358
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:55,043
and I just accidentally kept dashing through this spot.

359
00:26:55,723 --> 00:26:58,867
Um, but I'm curious, like what's a sk- so what's a skip that you need, you go,

360
00:26:58,967 --> 00:27:02,252
okay, that's good, that's high skill, and what's a skip where you go,

361
00:27:02,352 --> 00:27:04,955
that's not fun, we need to get that out, or it's going to,

362
00:27:05,356 --> 00:27:07,098
like, we don't consider that something we want in the game.

363
00:27:07,935 --> 00:27:09,297
Yeah, that's a very good question.

364
00:27:09,697 --> 00:27:12,619
You know, it depends on the situation, actually.

365
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:17,764
There are plenty of out-of-bounds situations or missing collisions, stuff like that.

366
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:21,907
It's like, you know, it depends on the situation.

367
00:27:21,947 --> 00:27:26,331
Mostly you fix that, but you don't have to, like, patch every hole.

368
00:27:27,111 --> 00:27:28,753
The main thing is to keep the game fun.

369
00:27:29,453 --> 00:27:33,857
If you are having fun and you are not breaking it, like going crazy and making bugs...

370
00:27:35,683 --> 00:27:40,265
We don't want to stop the player, as Jan said, and the guys.

371
00:27:41,086 --> 00:27:45,728
There are not plenty of cats here, so...

372
00:27:45,748 --> 00:27:49,210
It depends on the situation, actually.

373
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:53,433
Yeah, it's more like when someone is trying to break the collision,

374
00:27:54,153 --> 00:27:56,654
where we have a wall and a floor,

375
00:27:56,734 --> 00:27:59,156
and let's say that they are pushing into the collision.

376
00:28:00,395 --> 00:28:02,116
doing that they are out of bounds.

377
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:05,039
So this is something that we are fixing.

378
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:08,001
But for example, when we have a normal gameplay situation

379
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:11,083
but you can, for example, skip some enemies

380
00:28:11,384 --> 00:28:17,168
or you know, when you don't have to use, for example, that grapple

381
00:28:17,388 --> 00:28:22,112
but because you can jump using the ledge boost jumping

382
00:28:22,312 --> 00:28:26,756
you can jump on the really, you know, big distances

383
00:28:27,076 --> 00:28:28,817
this is something which we are not patching.

384
00:28:28,917 --> 00:28:29,418
So you are...

385
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:33,142
You are able to do it using all the speedrunner's techniques.

386
00:28:33,222 --> 00:28:40,628
You are able to move pretty fast and you don't have to use all the walls, for example, which are indicated to you.

387
00:28:40,669 --> 00:28:46,093
You can skip some gaps, some walls, etc.

388
00:28:46,213 --> 00:28:48,695
So this is what we are living as it is.

389
00:28:49,296 --> 00:28:51,938
Chat would like to know if you guys are getting rid of the triangle skip?

390
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,801
Each guard has a built-in lockdown.

391
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:25,478
Yeah, we wish to fix it, to be honest.

392
00:29:26,539 --> 00:29:28,220
Actually, you know, it's not that simple.

393
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,482
Yeah, yeah, because...

394
00:29:31,702 --> 00:29:33,083
So maybe not for the release.

395
00:29:34,945 --> 00:29:35,785
But we will see.

396
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:36,966
Gotcha.

397
00:29:37,006 --> 00:29:40,148
The out-of-bounds situation into the elevator, yeah, I get it.

398
00:29:40,629 --> 00:29:46,173
Yeah, yeah, we saw it, like, 17 seconds or 16 seconds in the first level.

399
00:29:46,213 --> 00:29:47,914
It was so easy to fix, actually.

400
00:29:49,175 --> 00:29:49,835
Not so fun.

401
00:29:51,548 --> 00:29:55,790
Well hey, maybe it just gets too hard, you know? Maybe it just gets put off for another day.

402
00:29:56,131 --> 00:30:02,274
Uh, um, Chad's got some great fun. I'm so, like, it's so much fun to see players just like,

403
00:30:02,314 --> 00:30:05,776
it's so exciting about something. It's like, like something from a small team that's not out yet.

404
00:30:06,016 --> 00:30:10,299
Um, you know, like, it's like Ubisoft, you know, like big companies, your Ubisoft, your Activision,

405
00:30:10,339 --> 00:30:14,441
they, they, you know, can spend thousands of dollars on marketing and these guys, this chat

406
00:30:14,541 --> 00:30:18,564
is full of people who are just like, oh wow, like, y'all have played this demo for hours and it's

407
00:30:18,584 --> 00:30:20,164
like, their enthusiasm is infectious.

408
00:30:21,005 --> 00:30:23,547
But I so as much as I want to answer other questions from chat

409
00:30:23,608 --> 00:30:27,751
I do need to get through some dev focus questions because like I said, we're kind of a dev focus channel

410
00:30:29,213 --> 00:30:30,494
Though they do want to know about merch

411
00:30:30,514 --> 00:30:36,700
So I'm gonna suggest that for any questions about merch you take that full if you guys have a discord for social media

412
00:30:37,501 --> 00:30:38,461
I suggest that question

413
00:30:40,143 --> 00:30:42,765
For my, uh, Damien, I want to talk about a 3D art thing.

414
00:30:42,965 --> 00:30:45,647
So I was shocked by, um, uh, um...

415
00:30:46,708 --> 00:30:49,931
Uh, I am only running an i5 processor on a GT970,

416
00:30:49,951 --> 00:30:53,053
uh, which is not a powerhouse machine.

417
00:30:53,073 --> 00:30:54,555
I'm working on, I'm gonna do an upgrade soon.

418
00:30:54,835 --> 00:30:57,597
Um, but I was, I got, I got this game demo running,

419
00:30:57,737 --> 00:31:00,299
and I, you saw me futz with the settings at the beginning,

420
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,741
and I went, oh, this is running great.

421
00:31:02,801 --> 00:31:04,783
Like, the footage we have is really smooth, um...

422
00:31:06,124 --> 00:31:09,945
It's thankfully, like, my CPU's even handling all the stuff we're doing right now okay,

423
00:31:09,985 --> 00:31:11,605
and it's giving me some trouble on other stuff lately.

424
00:31:12,225 --> 00:31:15,326
What, um, when you're making art like this, I know one challenge is making, you know,

425
00:31:15,366 --> 00:31:18,947
for these vibrant, beautiful 3D settings, is making sure that they can still, you know,

426
00:31:18,967 --> 00:31:23,288
uh, making environment assets that also don't, you know,

427
00:31:23,308 --> 00:31:27,529
especially when speed is involved, especially when the frame rate, you know, is something to be managed.

428
00:31:27,549 --> 00:31:28,410
Like, what is sort of your...

429
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:33,752
What was your practice as this game's 3D artist for a first-person high-speed game to make sure that like,

430
00:31:34,132 --> 00:31:37,614
stuff could be beautiful, but also not be a memory hog or not be a...

431
00:31:38,634 --> 00:31:41,955
Yeah, not be a hog on resources and not be too expensive, you know,

432
00:31:42,176 --> 00:31:44,176
so that players can play this game on cheaper machines.

433
00:31:46,737 --> 00:31:55,960
There's no simple answer to that question, but there are a couple of main areas where we focus.

434
00:31:56,060 --> 00:32:02,482
Obviously texture density and the amount of texture we put into the game, the amount of triangles.

435
00:32:03,203 --> 00:32:08,885
And I guess overall level complexity, also the lighting is very important.

436
00:32:11,266 --> 00:32:19,816
We use Unreal, which is using kind of a mixed way of lighting stuff, so it's not all real-time lighting.

437
00:32:20,998 --> 00:32:29,068
Lights that are not that important are baked, and it's pretty cool because with that you can get very nice looking global illumination.

438
00:32:29,548 --> 00:32:31,569
which is very cheap for your hardware.

439
00:32:32,029 --> 00:32:37,791
Basically you're taking out lightmaps and it's all stored like a static texture.

440
00:32:38,171 --> 00:32:44,874
Yeah, so that's something that really well is optimizing the lighting.

441
00:32:45,914 --> 00:32:51,016
We make sure that we don't go overboard with level geometry.

442
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:59,026
However, modern hardware can handle a lot of that stuff and we have really complex scenes

443
00:32:59,046 --> 00:33:00,347
in the editor.

444
00:33:00,727 --> 00:33:08,615
We kind of made like basic guidelines how many draw calls and how many triangles we

445
00:33:08,655 --> 00:33:09,716
want to put in a scene.

446
00:33:10,737 --> 00:33:13,739
Some things are more demanding on your hardware definitely.

447
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:26,309
We test the game on a wide array of the target hardware and try to get the best possible results with that.

448
00:33:26,369 --> 00:33:33,335
We also optimize the game for the consoles, so that gives us a lot of performance stats and profiling.

449
00:33:33,726 --> 00:33:44,519
Obviously, there is a lot of stuff that our programmers are constantly working on when

450
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:50,165
it comes to optimizing AI, optimizing a lot of in-engine tick times.

451
00:33:50,745 --> 00:33:56,608
and stuff like that, more complex stuff that I don't really understand.

452
00:33:57,188 --> 00:34:00,009
So we basically play the game all the time.

453
00:34:00,349 --> 00:34:04,771
We have a lot of performance stats, we have a lot of feedback from the players that play the game.

454
00:34:05,311 --> 00:34:07,232
Thanks to that we can really...

455
00:34:07,652 --> 00:34:14,014
We put a lot of work into optimization and making sure the game runs the best as we can.

456
00:34:14,734 --> 00:34:20,435
It's also very important due to the fact that we also support ray tracing.

457
00:34:20,615 --> 00:34:27,417
So obviously ray tracing, when you turn it on, it's an additional cost for your hardware.

458
00:34:27,437 --> 00:34:29,998
So you want the base game to run as well as possible.

459
00:34:31,118 --> 00:34:34,201
before adding that additional performance hit.

460
00:34:36,262 --> 00:34:44,008
That's another reason why we put a lot of hard work into optimizing the game.

461
00:34:44,468 --> 00:34:48,511
We don't have... maybe I will go back to the...

462
00:34:49,191 --> 00:34:50,952
We give people a lot of freedom.

463
00:34:50,972 --> 00:34:58,076
This is also the reason why we were able to create this amount of level art and art assets in such a short time.

464
00:35:13,764 --> 00:35:17,586
We have very experienced people working, basically.

465
00:35:17,847 --> 00:35:23,850
We made already a gods trigger together, so we're kind of a small team.

466
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:28,813
We can communicate very fast, so if there's something wrong in the game,

467
00:35:28,873 --> 00:35:33,196
we can directly communicate and basically in a matter of hours we can fix stuff.

468
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:37,498
So there's not much overhead in communications.

469
00:35:37,698 --> 00:35:39,119
So yeah, I guess that's the reason.

470
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,901
That's the reason as well.

471
00:35:42,454 --> 00:35:42,874
Right on.

472
00:35:43,554 --> 00:35:45,655
Yon, I'm gonna pivot to you because I have a question.

473
00:35:45,675 --> 00:35:48,976
I've played a little bit more of this game, so I've gotten to see where some of the narrative goes.

474
00:35:49,016 --> 00:35:51,136
And like we were- I was about to tell you before the call, I'm...

475
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:54,937
Uh, there's things that hooked me as a- as a story lover in games already.

476
00:35:55,077 --> 00:35:57,958
I- I have- I have this thing- there's just these games that come along every few years.

477
00:35:57,978 --> 00:36:01,199
They're like these really great first-person, like, motion games.

478
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:04,199
Um, god, I'm forgetting the name of the other one I have, but it's on Steam.

479
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:07,980
Uh, uh, and it was one of the first games we streamed on this channel.

480
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:10,081
I'm like, wow, these games like actually like do a lot to...

481
00:36:10,661 --> 00:36:11,963
hook me in and pull me in.

482
00:36:12,263 --> 00:36:15,266
But one of the challenges I do find in this genre is...

483
00:36:16,246 --> 00:36:18,428
Obviously like we discussed before.

484
00:36:18,969 --> 00:36:21,271
When you're gameplay first, one HP,

485
00:36:23,873 --> 00:36:27,096
there's not much opportunity to stop, sit and stare, and just story.

486
00:36:27,136 --> 00:36:29,378
Though we're going to see a narrative sequence that happens later again.

487
00:36:29,398 --> 00:36:30,920
And we've already seen it earlier in the stream.

488
00:36:32,921 --> 00:36:38,205
My experience was I was impressed by how some pretty impactful dialogue was coming through later on.

489
00:36:38,926 --> 00:36:45,051
And it was timed well enough that it still, like, I got through, you know, I was rushing through a section of a level pretty confidently.

490
00:36:45,611 --> 00:36:49,514
And the dialogue didn't rush past, like, I didn't rush past the dialogue, it didn't get cut off.

491
00:36:49,534 --> 00:36:55,038
So I'm curious what some of, like, how you can still, what are your thoughts on getting character and getting important story bits through.

492
00:36:55,559 --> 00:37:00,142
without sacrificing in those short amounts of time.

493
00:37:00,182 --> 00:37:02,843
What are your thoughts as a narrative designer about accomplishing that?

494
00:37:04,544 --> 00:37:06,546
Well, basically that's the main challenge.

495
00:37:07,606 --> 00:37:11,949
You have to play and replay and replay the level over and over

496
00:37:12,209 --> 00:37:14,971
and tweak and tweak and cut stuff out

497
00:37:15,211 --> 00:37:17,493
and move stuff around and shuffle it

498
00:37:17,673 --> 00:37:20,154
until you're pretty confident that it works.

499
00:37:21,816 --> 00:37:23,337
When it works, you can feel it

500
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:32,547
I think, well, it also has to do with the pacing that Martin mentioned, because if you

501
00:37:32,807 --> 00:37:40,856
don't have any moments that you are able to say for 100% that, alright, I do have some

502
00:37:40,896 --> 00:37:45,842
time here to tell something important that won't be missed by the player.

503
00:37:47,163 --> 00:37:48,824
It's important to have points like that.

504
00:37:48,864 --> 00:37:52,787
So for example, what we're seeing right now is the cybervoid section.

505
00:37:53,708 --> 00:37:57,311
And in there, there's less stuff happening.

506
00:37:57,351 --> 00:38:04,096
You're not in immediate danger, so it's a pretty safe bet to assume that the player will be able to concentrate on the dialogue more.

507
00:38:04,797 --> 00:38:08,338
And that's how we use it many times throughout the game.

508
00:38:08,358 --> 00:38:17,720
As a sort of section that is able to deliver exposition and deliver the story in a more safe manner.

509
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:26,223
You know, because it's... depending on how fast you're going and depending on how much attention you're paying,

510
00:38:26,763 --> 00:38:33,065
it's easy to, you know, just skip or overlook some finer points of the plot.

511
00:38:33,805 --> 00:38:44,049
And those sections, without any fighting, they are a platform that we use to deliver the story in a more laid-back manner.

512
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:52,133
But as I said, it's all about going back in there and tweaking it and seeing if it works and reworking it.

513
00:38:53,954 --> 00:39:05,300
While coming up with a sequence of dialogue and putting everything in a place that guarantees you, or at least gives you the best possible chance of working.

514
00:39:13,666 --> 00:39:18,470
You know, you've made a world for your game, you've made characters, like we were finding out here about the relationships between some of them.

515
00:39:19,652 --> 00:39:26,098
What's kind of your interest? Like, why go for Cyberpunk? What kind of characters were you hoping to explore with this?

516
00:39:26,118 --> 00:39:28,400
Like, sort of what... you know, you've made a really cool...

517
00:39:29,201 --> 00:39:32,382
Like, again, great mechanics, great levels, like, there's a lot of cool stuff happening there,

518
00:39:32,402 --> 00:39:35,244
but what kind of excited you? Like, why even tack on a story at all?

519
00:39:35,544 --> 00:39:38,145
And, which is to say, like, what kind of story were you interested in telling,

520
00:39:38,165 --> 00:39:41,026
and what were you all really passionate about in this space?

521
00:39:41,086 --> 00:39:46,709
Because I could also see this game succeeding as just kind of an arcadey experience with a good, like, visual,

522
00:39:46,769 --> 00:39:52,011
but instead you've, you know, layered on some pretty, uh, uh, functional narrative stuff,

523
00:39:52,031 --> 00:39:54,432
and I'm curious what we were passionate about on that front.

524
00:39:57,451 --> 00:40:04,074
Yes, so for the, let's say, cyberpunk world, I think the reason that we decided to do it,

525
00:40:04,554 --> 00:40:13,838
it was just because we are huge fans of that cyberpunk genre, let's say, that renaissance

526
00:40:13,858 --> 00:40:15,139
which is going on right now.

527
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:23,322
We have a CDPR game, Cyberpunk 2077, we had a new Blade Runner movie, that was something

528
00:40:23,362 --> 00:40:23,662
that we...

529
00:40:24,941 --> 00:40:27,377
We wanted to be a part of it, to be honest.

530
00:40:28,754 --> 00:40:37,501
Just by being gamers and fans of this genre, this is why we wanted to make a game in this setting.

531
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:41,244
But the other thing is that it really corresponds well with the gameplay which we had.

532
00:40:41,644 --> 00:40:57,758
That we had this kind of cyborg ninja character who can run through walls, who can dodge the bullets, slow down time, let's say, because he's so agile, he's so fast that he can dodge the bullet or deflect the bullet.

533
00:40:57,798 --> 00:40:57,878
So...

534
00:40:58,869 --> 00:41:06,351
That was the first reason and in terms of building the world, why we even add a narration to this game, because we just...

535
00:41:07,091 --> 00:41:15,614
We wanted it to be, for Ghost Hunters, it's supposed to be like something more than just arcade game.

536
00:41:16,215 --> 00:41:23,537
We wanted it to be something like, not a AAA experience, but that kind of indie premium experience,

537
00:41:23,557 --> 00:41:26,778
that you can also enjoy the visuals, that there you can...

538
00:41:27,516 --> 00:41:33,861
also enjoy the story of this game. So it's not like that it's not an important part of this game.

539
00:41:34,021 --> 00:41:40,906
It's like it's also an important part but of course our, you know, premise is gameplay first

540
00:41:41,187 --> 00:41:46,751
so it's like it serves to the gameplay. That's what I think Jan mentioned before.

541
00:41:49,168 --> 00:41:55,731
Jan, you can also add anything about the world itself, because it's also pretty interesting what we have here.

542
00:41:55,751 --> 00:42:00,734
It's not something like a usual, like a generic cyberpunk stuff.

543
00:42:03,394 --> 00:42:14,809
Oh yeah, if I might add something, I'd say that I'm pretty sure that we came up with a very particular kind of cyberpunk because of the setting.

544
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:19,055
The Dharma Tower is, you know, when you...

545
00:42:19,696 --> 00:42:26,341
If you place the entirety of the game inside one megastructure, you already are drawing a pretty powerful picture.

546
00:42:26,942 --> 00:42:31,185
This is a megastructure. This is one very particular place.

547
00:42:31,886 --> 00:42:36,669
It's got its history. It's not somewhere in the world. It's this place.

548
00:42:36,949 --> 00:42:38,951
And this place has history and it...

549
00:42:40,301 --> 00:42:45,624
came from some beginnings and already you know the story begins to write itself really

550
00:42:45,864 --> 00:42:49,346
when you come up with the visuals, when you build this world

551
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:56,791
the questions ask themselves and then you try to explore them and you learn more and more about this world

552
00:42:56,891 --> 00:42:59,612
and it begins to unfold in a way.

553
00:43:00,193 --> 00:43:02,934
So yeah, I wasn't with the project from day one

554
00:43:03,074 --> 00:43:06,757
so I can't really speak for the first decisions being made

555
00:43:06,797 --> 00:43:09,558
but I was very happy to be able to join the project.

556
00:43:10,427 --> 00:43:15,792
And well, yeah, for me it was very appealing from the start, this vision of this giant

557
00:43:15,832 --> 00:43:19,516
structure, this mega structure that's the whole world really.

558
00:43:20,337 --> 00:43:27,323
And the stories that come to mind immediately when you think of a place like that, well,

559
00:43:27,724 --> 00:43:28,785
there's abundance of that.

560
00:43:32,646 --> 00:43:37,429
We're nearing the end of our time with y'all, so I'm going to get one more question in from chat, which I think is a good design question.

561
00:43:38,009 --> 00:43:44,633
Before we go, and we let this question play us out, if they have more questions about this game, where can they ask them? Where should they ask them?

562
00:43:46,674 --> 00:43:51,757
Totally our Discord channel. I mean, it's right now very popular, but...

563
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:53,901
You should join it, of course.

564
00:43:54,402 --> 00:43:54,862
Right on.

565
00:43:55,483 --> 00:43:56,143
Um, okay.

566
00:43:56,343 --> 00:43:58,685
Uh, for our part, uh, we are Game Developers Conference.

567
00:43:58,725 --> 00:44:02,028
We are a place where people who make games get together and talk about making games.

568
00:44:02,749 --> 00:44:07,513
Um, if you'd like to learn, hear more from us, uh, our Facebook and Twitter info is at the bullet bottom.

569
00:44:07,813 --> 00:44:11,897
If you want to see more streams from more cool game developers, just hit the follow button on this channel.

570
00:44:12,237 --> 00:44:17,381
For our part, if you yourself are a game developer, um, uh, like, say, these folks from Stardust DevZero,

571
00:44:17,441 --> 00:44:20,224
who I kind of want to get their question in too, so we'll see if we can squeeze it in.

572
00:44:20,744 --> 00:44:27,168
Um, uh, uh, you might be interested in our master classes. That is a new thing we're trying out this December.

573
00:44:27,688 --> 00:44:32,431
Um, it's really cool. You can take a class, have some one-on-one time with great instructors like Jonah Loeb,

574
00:44:32,451 --> 00:44:36,393
who's a great character, who's a character artist who worked on games like Skyrim and Fallout.

575
00:44:36,813 --> 00:44:41,856
Um, you can get narrative tips from people like Susan O'Connor. Um, so that's kind of, oops, uh,

576
00:44:41,876 --> 00:44:46,359
we're just gonna, we're just gonna leave this menu up for the last part of our stream if it would.

577
00:44:46,479 --> 00:44:49,080
Yeah, there we go. Nope, did it again. Okay.

578
00:44:49,721 --> 00:44:51,722
Here, we'll just leave the menu right there.

579
00:44:52,603 --> 00:44:55,405
Yeah, so we're going to get two more questions in, like I said.

580
00:44:55,445 --> 00:44:58,228
If you want to check out those masterclasses, you can check those out on our website.

581
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:01,711
4JanusSG would like to know,

582
00:45:01,791 --> 00:45:05,894
what was the decision behind removing the dash ability from the Cybervoid level,

583
00:45:06,235 --> 00:45:09,457
which you just saw a couple seconds ago when I was in Cybervoid?

584
00:45:11,799 --> 00:45:12,060
Yeah.

585
00:45:13,401 --> 00:45:17,284
The question is quite good, because we decided that we don't want to...

586
00:45:19,474 --> 00:45:25,438
give people as players as much speedrunning mechanics there.

587
00:45:25,619 --> 00:45:32,584
Because we wanted them to chill out a little bit on that section where you can listen to

588
00:45:32,624 --> 00:45:38,229
the story, where you can think about it a little bit.

589
00:45:39,627 --> 00:45:41,869
It's mainly the pacing reason, I think.

590
00:45:41,909 --> 00:45:46,975
That's why we delete this dash ability.

591
00:45:46,995 --> 00:45:52,642
And also, wall running is not present in cyber void levels.

592
00:45:52,762 --> 00:45:53,883
So that's the first thing.

593
00:45:53,944 --> 00:45:55,786
I think the second thing is that.

594
00:45:57,309 --> 00:46:04,293
We wanted to keep it consistent because we've got many types of VR levels.

595
00:46:04,933 --> 00:46:11,196
VR, sorry, that's our code name for it, but for cybervoid levels in our game.

596
00:46:11,596 --> 00:46:17,018
And you are doing many different things over there during the gameplay.

597
00:46:17,338 --> 00:46:23,261
And we wanted to keep it consistent that you are not able to dash and you are not able to wallrun over there.

598
00:46:25,461 --> 00:46:29,864
I think that's the main two reasons. I don't know if Marcin, if you want to add something?

599
00:46:30,725 --> 00:46:39,831
Yeah, basically you got the point straight. So yeah, so that's the way it was designed,

600
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:47,156
to shield out the player and make it a bit different so the play style of the Cybervoid

601
00:46:47,276 --> 00:46:52,179
is not the same. Yeah, so it's not so rushed, you know, that you don't have to...

602
00:46:53,301 --> 00:46:56,202
be in such a hurry as in normal gameplay.

603
00:47:15,627 --> 00:47:17,948
They seem to be a newer game developer.

604
00:47:18,448 --> 00:47:22,551
They would like to say that they're making a 2D puzzle platformer and they've never designed

605
00:47:22,591 --> 00:47:23,531
a full level before.

606
00:47:24,492 --> 00:47:27,053
What do they do and how do they tell when that level is fun?

607
00:47:27,193 --> 00:47:29,134
What's your guys' advice for Stardust?

608
00:47:30,895 --> 00:47:34,277
Just give it to your friends and watch them playing.

609
00:47:34,637 --> 00:47:35,318
That's our main...

610
00:47:36,522 --> 00:47:39,683
I think advice, right, Marcin? This is what we are doing.

611
00:47:40,104 --> 00:47:48,408
Yeah, so basically my advice and Asterodix's, the main thing is to give it to somebody who

612
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:53,811
doesn't know the game and actually is not an expert, you know, and see what they do.

613
00:47:54,011 --> 00:48:00,575
If they do and go where you want them to go and they are having fun, you know, you can see it.

614
00:48:01,472 --> 00:48:06,215
They will say things, but you don't have to talk to them to know this.

615
00:48:06,255 --> 00:48:12,679
You see what hands they are using, where they go, what do they listen to.

616
00:48:12,699 --> 00:48:15,540
What's their emotions?

617
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:18,782
Think about the player movement.

618
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:23,285
The level is good when those things click in.

619
00:48:23,946 --> 00:48:26,227
One thing comes from the other.

620
00:48:26,307 --> 00:48:30,169
So when you show the dash, then you use the dash in a different context.

621
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:50,800
So one thing comes from the other and the pacing, you know, so there's not too much stuff and too convoluted, you know, or too much action, you know, you know, basically playtest it, playtest it, playtest it and then tweak it, tweak it and then playtest it more and tweak it more.

622
00:48:51,893 --> 00:48:58,615
Maybe it's basic advice but I don't know if it's that common that you know you should start

623
00:48:59,095 --> 00:49:05,697
testing your game on something who is not involved into the development like from very early days of

624
00:49:05,977 --> 00:49:13,699
development. That's our main advice. You know we were in like six months in the development and we

625
00:49:13,739 --> 00:49:18,041
had like first open play test I think.

626
00:49:19,197 --> 00:49:23,700
Yeah, this is something like that, because we were starting at the beginning of the year

627
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:28,764
and in August we had a demo on Gamescom, so pretty fast.

628
00:49:29,204 --> 00:49:30,245
Oh wow, congrats.

629
00:49:30,665 --> 00:49:35,909
Yeah, also if I may add one thing, don't be attached to your design ideas, you know.

630
00:49:36,589 --> 00:49:38,831
If it works, it works. If it doesn't, try something new.

631
00:49:41,364 --> 00:49:51,366
Also something you might watch for is to not try to make levels look good at the design stage

632
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:55,047
because you probably have to scrap everything and start from the beginning.

633
00:49:56,967 --> 00:50:01,928
Yeah, just some white boxes are fine, right?

634
00:50:02,008 --> 00:50:07,389
Yeah, you don't need graphics or anything. You can playtest like 15 minutes.

635
00:50:08,292 --> 00:50:12,616
If it's fun without the graphic, without the art, it is good, yeah.

636
00:50:13,937 --> 00:50:17,501
Right on. Well, folks in chat, thank you so much for hanging out with us.

637
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:23,827
Tronjavolta, Tronvolta, GNSSG, MetaLive, it's been great hanging out with you.

638
00:50:24,407 --> 00:50:28,771
The game is Ghostrunner. It's out on the 27th. That's correct, right? 27th? Sweet.

639
00:50:29,231 --> 00:50:31,273
Yeah, that's correct. Yeah.

640
00:50:31,574 --> 00:50:40,618
Yeah, and it's a neat game. And like I said, I hope that some of you join us in the future when we check out other neat games here on the GDC Twitch channel with the people who make them.

641
00:50:40,658 --> 00:50:47,682
That's one of our, that's always what it comes back to at GDC is it's the people who make games. We want to give you the opportunity to hear from them.

642
00:50:47,942 --> 00:50:56,926
With that, have a good day, everyone. For y'all in Poland, have a good night. Thank you for joining us so late. And that'll be it. Bye, everyone.

643
00:50:58,267 --> 00:50:58,447
Bye.
