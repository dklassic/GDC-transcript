1
00:00:05,775 --> 00:00:11,119
It's 3.30. Thanks for coming, everybody. I don't know why everybody's here, because this

2
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:18,424
is a talk about a really old, kind of mediocre game. How many of you actually were born since

3
00:00:18,424 --> 00:00:25,569
this game came out? Yeah, I figured it'd be about half and half. Obviously, I have very

4
00:00:25,569 --> 00:00:30,513
fond memories about Raid on Muggling Bay. This is always the way I see it in my mind.

5
00:00:33,512 --> 00:00:36,972
Although this is not exactly a screenshot from the game, in fact this is like some recent

6
00:00:36,972 --> 00:00:43,534
Activision thing, this screenshot, as a matter of fact, is seven times larger than the entire

7
00:00:43,534 --> 00:00:51,176
game was, and all the content and everything. So right on Bungling Bay would have fit in

8
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:52,896
that little box over there.

9
00:00:52,896 --> 00:00:58,598
Now this is what the actual original looked like, back from 1984. It was my first game.

10
00:01:00,025 --> 00:01:02,346
It was very interesting, kind of, the learning I went through on this.

11
00:01:02,346 --> 00:01:05,787
And I don't, didn't really consider myself a designer at the time when I was working on this game.

12
00:01:05,787 --> 00:01:09,908
I actually went back and did a very quick little calculation.

13
00:01:09,908 --> 00:01:13,489
And this is about 80K of code, data, sound and everything.

14
00:01:13,489 --> 00:01:14,950
And I spent about a year working on it.

15
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:18,391
And that works out to about one byte per minute, you know, of effort that I spent on this game.

16
00:01:18,391 --> 00:01:21,712
You know, that was kind of the productivity of somebody back at that time in the early 80s.

17
00:01:21,712 --> 00:01:28,413
The more recent games I've been working on, in fact, even divided across, you know, 50 people over several years.

18
00:01:29,199 --> 00:01:32,159
everybody on the team is roughly generating about 100 bytes per minute.

19
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,400
So we've gotten 100 times more productive in that period of time,

20
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,521
which is great news, right?

21
00:01:38,521 --> 00:01:41,502
Now, Bumbling Bay was released back in 1984,

22
00:01:41,502 --> 00:01:46,883
which was, it kind of surprises me how long ago that actually seems now.

23
00:01:46,883 --> 00:01:51,044
If we think back to 1984, this is when Ma Bell was broken up, finally.

24
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:53,225
This is, gas was a dollar and ten cents a gallon.

25
00:01:53,225 --> 00:01:56,546
The Soviets were boycotting the Olympics.

26
00:01:56,546 --> 00:01:58,026
This is back when the Soviet Union still existed.

27
00:01:59,017 --> 00:02:01,939
In the theaters, the big movies were Terminator and Ghostbusters.

28
00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:02,940
Two dollars and fifty cents to go see a movie.

29
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:07,504
And the big things on TV, the top shows were Magnum P.I. and Dynasty.

30
00:02:07,504 --> 00:02:13,008
And this is also the year that the first portable CD player came out.

31
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:17,412
And that was one of the things that really kind of changed the face of the way games

32
00:02:17,412 --> 00:02:19,813
were made and content delivered.

33
00:02:19,813 --> 00:02:22,275
And on that, of course, the top song that year...

34
00:02:28,175 --> 00:02:32,757
This is also way before we understood that Kevin Bacon was the center of all social networks.

35
00:02:32,757 --> 00:02:39,700
As a matter of fact, the term social network wasn't even in our lexicon back then.

36
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,482
Now, 1980 is when I bought my first PC, an Apple II computer.

37
00:02:42,482 --> 00:02:46,024
Back in those days, I was actually kind of into auto racing.

38
00:02:46,024 --> 00:02:49,025
And my other big thing besides auto racing was robots.

39
00:02:49,315 --> 00:02:50,356
And that's why I bought this computer.

40
00:02:50,356 --> 00:02:51,717
It was actually one of my racing buddies,

41
00:02:51,717 --> 00:02:53,699
he had a business where he would take Apple IIs

42
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:55,500
and kind of remake them into medical computers.

43
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,341
And so he got a deal on Apple II computers,

44
00:02:57,341 --> 00:02:59,963
and he said, oh, you've got to buy one of these things.

45
00:02:59,963 --> 00:03:00,584
They're really cool.

46
00:03:00,584 --> 00:03:06,288
And so I bought one to connect to my homebrew robots at the time.

47
00:03:06,288 --> 00:03:09,110
And I was living in New York at the time,

48
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:12,132
and I should explain that I lost my home in the Oakland Hills Fire back in 1991.

49
00:03:12,132 --> 00:03:15,395
And almost all my old prototypes and photos of Bungling Bay,

50
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:17,517
you know, basically were burned up in that fire.

51
00:03:17,517 --> 00:03:18,317
So basically I had to...

52
00:03:18,805 --> 00:03:20,086
get a celebrity stand in here.

53
00:03:20,086 --> 00:03:25,429
So I'm having to recreate dramatically, you know, this aspect of my life.

54
00:03:25,429 --> 00:03:29,752
But anyway, as a kid, teenager, I grew up playing these elaborate board games,

55
00:03:29,752 --> 00:03:33,054
these board games like Panzer Blitz, which is a wonderful game.

56
00:03:33,054 --> 00:03:35,616
And I had this Apple II that I was kind of teaching myself to program,

57
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:38,097
and I was living in New York and there was one computer store

58
00:03:38,097 --> 00:03:39,978
in all of New York City that I would go to.

59
00:03:39,978 --> 00:03:43,781
And at some point they started carrying games up on the wall,

60
00:03:43,781 --> 00:03:45,362
basically in Ziploc bags.

61
00:03:46,058 --> 00:03:48,500
And I started buying some of these and trying them out.

62
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,501
You know, some of the earliest stuff was Bill Budge's work,

63
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:51,521
the pinball games and stuff.

64
00:03:51,521 --> 00:03:53,422
This guy, Nasser Gabeli,

65
00:03:53,422 --> 00:03:56,283
who made these amazingly graphically intense games

66
00:03:56,283 --> 00:03:58,064
that he programmed entirely in the assembler.

67
00:03:58,064 --> 00:04:01,106
And then some of the old games that I used to play as board games

68
00:04:01,106 --> 00:04:01,706
were starting to appear.

69
00:04:01,706 --> 00:04:03,267
This is one I actually spent a lot of time with

70
00:04:03,267 --> 00:04:04,147
called Computer Ambush.

71
00:04:04,147 --> 00:04:05,948
This is actually on the box.

72
00:04:05,948 --> 00:04:08,489
It even said, programmed in AppleSoft Basic.

73
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:10,811
And, you know, basically it was a faithful recreation

74
00:04:10,811 --> 00:04:11,531
of the board game.

75
00:04:11,531 --> 00:04:13,532
And you'd sit there and you'd make your move,

76
00:04:13,532 --> 00:04:14,672
and then you'd, you know, say, finish.

77
00:04:14,672 --> 00:04:15,493
It was a turn-based game.

78
00:04:16,103 --> 00:04:18,385
And then it would say, calculating the computer's move.

79
00:04:18,385 --> 00:04:21,366
And it would show this little progress bar that was about 40 minutes.

80
00:04:21,366 --> 00:04:23,447
And so you'd go out and get lunch, you know, and come back.

81
00:04:23,447 --> 00:04:25,648
And after lunch, maybe the computer had finished thinking about its move,

82
00:04:25,648 --> 00:04:26,609
and then you'd take your move.

83
00:04:26,609 --> 00:04:31,792
Which is about how long it took, you know, to play the real game with a real person.

84
00:04:31,792 --> 00:04:34,933
Flight Simulator was a huge kind of eye-opening experience for me,

85
00:04:34,933 --> 00:04:38,775
that for the first time there was like this really kind of consistent, microscopic little world.

86
00:04:38,775 --> 00:04:41,837
Even though it was wireframe graphics, it was incredibly primitive.

87
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:46,124
compared to what we have nowadays, but yet the idea that there was a simulator of this

88
00:04:46,124 --> 00:04:50,446
complete little world just amazed me. And the Apple II version, the very first one,

89
00:04:50,446 --> 00:04:53,487
actually came out when you bought it, it actually, the first thing you had to do was write a

90
00:04:53,487 --> 00:04:56,929
machine language patch to get it to boot up properly on the Apple II Plus. And so the

91
00:04:56,929 --> 00:05:00,050
kind of the level of sophistication of the users was radically different than we, you

92
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:04,172
know, think of these things now. Choplifter was another one, you know, where finally we

93
00:05:04,172 --> 00:05:08,734
were starting to get kind of arcade-like graphics. People were really starting to push the Apple

94
00:05:08,734 --> 00:05:11,375
II graphically to what it could actually do.

95
00:05:12,188 --> 00:05:16,250
And, but I basically got absorbed in learning how this computer worked. And, you know, that

96
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:20,752
generation of 8-bit computers, one person could pretty much almost grok the whole thing.

97
00:05:20,752 --> 00:05:24,234
You could understand the interrupt structure, the hardware, the operating system, all the

98
00:05:24,234 --> 00:05:27,875
calls. And that was probably about the last time that one person could fully understand

99
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:32,757
every operation within one of these machines. But one of the things that really sucked me

100
00:05:32,757 --> 00:05:37,239
in, you know, as I was kind of learning about this stuff, was Conway's Life. And probably

101
00:05:37,239 --> 00:05:41,181
most of you are familiar with this. You know, it's this little cellular automata world,

102
00:05:41,181 --> 00:05:42,062
deterministic.

103
00:05:42,428 --> 00:05:47,012
amazing patterns emerge from this. Complexity emerges from utter simplicity.

104
00:05:47,012 --> 00:05:52,815
And this is one of those things that can basically drive you crazy. I spent, almost lost a year

105
00:05:52,815 --> 00:05:58,279
of my life to this. And, you know, there's good and bad that came out of it, but luckily

106
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:01,901
I pulled out of it. But, you know, one of the things that I was kind of obsessed with

107
00:06:01,901 --> 00:06:05,224
was programming this myself. And at first I programmed it in, you know, AppleSoft Basic.

108
00:06:05,224 --> 00:06:08,586
And then I taught myself Pascal and did it in Pascal because it was ten times faster.

109
00:06:09,117 --> 00:06:13,338
And then that was really the one thing that kind of got me to finally break down and learn machine language,

110
00:06:13,338 --> 00:06:17,619
which was, you know, kind of a radical thing for me compared to Pascal,

111
00:06:17,619 --> 00:06:19,540
which is highly structured, highly data-typed, etc.

112
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:24,721
But the fact that I was able to make a live version that was a hundred times faster than my AppleSoft Basic one

113
00:06:24,721 --> 00:06:28,562
incentivized me to spend, you know, just sit down and spend two months learning how to do machine coding.

114
00:06:28,562 --> 00:06:32,823
And at that point I was basically piling up with all these games I was playing,

115
00:06:32,823 --> 00:06:36,083
and I started thinking, you know, well, maybe I should try making a game, you know,

116
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:38,924
at least they'd be tax-deductible then, all the stuff I buy from my computer.

117
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:45,650
And so it was almost more of a whim, that I'm just going to try programming a game that I've learned, you know, to program and that I enjoy games.

118
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:48,452
And it really kind of came down to, you know, what kind of game am I going to do?

119
00:06:48,452 --> 00:06:53,355
Now at that time, also, a lot of the people in the Apple II were really kind of on their second and third generation games.

120
00:06:53,355 --> 00:06:57,158
They really had figured out kind of how to exploit that hardware to the fullest.

121
00:06:57,158 --> 00:06:59,679
And so I was kind of a little behind the pack on that one.

122
00:06:59,679 --> 00:07:02,461
But right around that time, the Commodore 64 was just coming out to market.

123
00:07:02,461 --> 00:07:03,722
And so I thought, well, I have an idea.

124
00:07:03,722 --> 00:07:07,805
I'll just kind of buy one of these new computers and learn it as quickly as I can.

125
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,502
and work on that machine. That way it's more of a level playing field.

126
00:07:10,502 --> 00:07:13,343
So I did. I went out and bought a shiny new Commodore 64.

127
00:07:13,343 --> 00:07:15,364
I paid full retail price of $600 for it.

128
00:07:15,364 --> 00:07:18,346
Very shortly afterwards it dropped to about $300

129
00:07:18,346 --> 00:07:20,747
and that's when it really just kind of skyrocketed, the penetration of it.

130
00:07:20,747 --> 00:07:24,730
And basically the only technical information that came with it

131
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:26,851
was the programmer's reference guide.

132
00:07:26,851 --> 00:07:28,712
And basically I absorbed that book.

133
00:07:28,712 --> 00:07:32,994
I just spent day after day reading and absorbing and experimenting with this computer.

134
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,735
Now what made the Commodore 64 kind of special,

135
00:07:34,735 --> 00:07:38,077
relative to the Apple II, were these two chips inside of it, Vic and Sid.

136
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:43,494
VIC was the Video Interface Controller, SID was the Sound Interface Device. And these,

137
00:07:43,494 --> 00:07:46,936
you know, basically were very powerful chips designed by Motorola that allowed the Commodore

138
00:07:46,936 --> 00:07:51,700
to do really cool graphic and sound things that the Apple II really couldn't do. Basically,

139
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:55,203
you kind of interacted with these chips through peaks and pokes, which were pretty aptly named

140
00:07:55,203 --> 00:07:58,886
because while the VIC was pretty logical, and you could read the manual and it would

141
00:07:58,886 --> 00:08:02,409
pretty much, you know, do what it said, the SID chip was totally unpredictable. And so

142
00:08:02,409 --> 00:08:05,531
pretty much all you did as a programmer was sit there and poke the thing over and over

143
00:08:05,531 --> 00:08:07,133
and see what kind of sounds it would make.

144
00:08:07,425 --> 00:08:11,148
It was totally experimental, you know, and just basically it was totally trial and error,

145
00:08:11,148 --> 00:08:15,712
empirical, let's see how to make, you know, let's say I'm going to poke it a million times.

146
00:08:15,712 --> 00:08:22,277
Now on the VIC chip, you know, one of the kind of cool features of the Commodore that attracted my attention right off the bat was the idea that you could redefine the character set,

147
00:08:22,277 --> 00:08:29,703
and then smoothly scroll that around on the screen, which kind of gave you the ability to do these smooth scrolling worlds that was very difficult to do on the Apple.

148
00:08:29,703 --> 00:08:36,549
You know, the Apple you basically had to implement it as a bitmap, and it wasn't fast enough, even with the 1 megahertz 6502, to move that much data very smoothly.

149
00:08:37,328 --> 00:08:42,450
So what I did is I had actually been programming on my Apple II for quite a while, and there

150
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:45,911
were some really good tools on the Apple II. At the time when the Commodore first came

151
00:08:45,911 --> 00:08:49,772
out, the tools really sucked. You know, the compilers were slow, the disk drive was slow.

152
00:08:49,772 --> 00:08:53,613
And I had a bright idea, which is I'm going to do all my programming on the Apple II,

153
00:08:53,613 --> 00:08:57,074
and then I'm going to dump it into the Commodore. So I actually wrote, you know, a little machine

154
00:08:57,074 --> 00:09:00,515
language routine on each end, built a hardware interface between the two, so I could do all

155
00:09:00,515 --> 00:09:03,816
of my programming on the Apple II, press a button, it would instantly spit that program

156
00:09:03,816 --> 00:09:05,217
into Commodore's memory and start running.

157
00:09:05,688 --> 00:09:07,349
So it made for a very quick iteration cycle,

158
00:09:07,349 --> 00:09:09,371
and so I was able to learn the machine very rapidly

159
00:09:09,371 --> 00:09:11,012
and keep all of my development tools on the Apple II.

160
00:09:11,012 --> 00:09:13,655
But still, I was kind of left with, you know,

161
00:09:13,655 --> 00:09:15,857
what kind of game do I want to make here?

162
00:09:15,857 --> 00:09:18,499
And ever since I was a little kid, I loved helicopters,

163
00:09:18,499 --> 00:09:21,001
you know, and right off the bat, it was like,

164
00:09:21,001 --> 00:09:22,402
okay, helicopters, helicopters.

165
00:09:22,402 --> 00:09:24,184
I remember as a young kid,

166
00:09:24,184 --> 00:09:26,186
probably my first interaction with a helicopter

167
00:09:26,186 --> 00:09:27,987
was my dad took me to a state fair,

168
00:09:27,987 --> 00:09:30,249
and they had helicopter rides in an old Bell 47.

169
00:09:30,249 --> 00:09:32,591
And I remember I was probably maybe four or five years old.

170
00:09:32,591 --> 00:09:33,732
We went up in a helicopter ride.

171
00:09:34,096 --> 00:09:36,957
and it was like the coolest thing in the world.

172
00:09:36,957 --> 00:09:40,738
So later, you know, one of my favorite TV shows was this,

173
00:09:40,738 --> 00:09:43,559
Mutual of Omaha's Wildlife Kingdom.

174
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:46,741
Marlon Perkins was this guy, and he would go around various places in the world

175
00:09:46,741 --> 00:09:48,461
and kind of study endangered animals.

176
00:09:48,461 --> 00:09:49,442
He had this sidekick, I forgot his name.

177
00:09:49,442 --> 00:09:52,343
But no matter what was happening, no matter what the animal was,

178
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:54,884
it seemed to me like almost every single episode

179
00:09:54,884 --> 00:09:57,485
eventually resolved into them chasing a herd with a helicopter

180
00:09:57,485 --> 00:09:59,405
and tranquilizing something.

181
00:09:59,758 --> 00:10:01,339
And so you'd watch this whole show about the animals,

182
00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:02,500
oh, the poor baboons or whatever,

183
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,041
but eventually they're chasing a herd of them

184
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:06,662
with a helicopter and cheating at them.

185
00:10:06,662 --> 00:10:08,903
But, so that was like kind of the money shot for this show.

186
00:10:08,903 --> 00:10:12,125
But, and so I, you know, I've just ever since then

187
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,266
loved helicopters of every type, civilian, military, etc.

188
00:10:14,266 --> 00:10:18,068
So I kind of knew that I wanted this game to be about helicopters.

189
00:10:18,068 --> 00:10:21,630
You know, now based upon kind of my interaction with Conway's life

190
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,631
and cellular automaton and all that,

191
00:10:23,631 --> 00:10:25,252
I knew I also wanted in this game

192
00:10:25,252 --> 00:10:28,373
there to be this kind of intricate, kind of clock-like world.

193
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:31,320
I've always enjoyed kind of things like this,

194
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,801
Ori's and things where they were kind of simulating

195
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:35,302
world in very mechanistic fashion,

196
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:38,044
very precise little things that have a lot of

197
00:10:38,044 --> 00:10:40,485
kind of unpredictable complexity emerging from them.

198
00:10:40,485 --> 00:10:41,666
So that was kind of like my second thing.

199
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,447
It's about helicopters and there's kind of this

200
00:10:43,447 --> 00:10:45,428
clock-like little world of things going on inside of it.

201
00:10:45,428 --> 00:10:47,289
And the last one was, you know,

202
00:10:47,289 --> 00:10:48,530
the games I've been playing on the Apple II,

203
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:50,731
you know, really were very simple little worlds.

204
00:10:50,731 --> 00:10:52,272
You were, you know, continuously scrolling

205
00:10:52,272 --> 00:10:53,693
back and forth or whatever.

206
00:10:53,693 --> 00:10:54,913
And I wanted a game where basically

207
00:10:54,913 --> 00:10:56,254
the world was large enough to get lost in.

208
00:10:57,015 --> 00:11:01,056
And that's, you know, basically what I wanted to accomplish with this, you know, smooth scrolling.

209
00:11:01,056 --> 00:11:06,557
I wanted to build a very large world that I could potentially kind of get lost in and feel like it was that large.

210
00:11:06,557 --> 00:11:10,238
So, going down this path, I kind of wrote two programs on the Commodore.

211
00:11:10,238 --> 00:11:11,858
One was Chedit and the other was Wedit.

212
00:11:11,858 --> 00:11:16,599
Chedit was a character editor, and this is what I would actually use to create custom characters.

213
00:11:16,599 --> 00:11:21,139
On the Commodore, you could redefine the character set and build graphic characters at fairly low resolution.

214
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:21,840
It was like 4 by 8.

215
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,360
And they had to be one of, you know, four of 16 colors.

216
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,440
This is the entire palette on the Commodore.

217
00:11:26,855 --> 00:11:30,556
and you had to pick your four favorite colors and kind of use those. And so the whole background

218
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:34,057
was kind of built out of those four colors. Now, Wettit was actually a program that allowed

219
00:11:34,057 --> 00:11:38,179
me to now scroll around this large world and place these custom characters in little patterns,

220
00:11:38,179 --> 00:11:41,700
just kind of dropping down tiles. And this is basically how I built the world for Raid

221
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:45,682
on Mungling Bay. And in fact, later, after I finished Raid on Mungling Bay, it was Wettit

222
00:11:45,682 --> 00:11:49,543
that kind of eventually evolved into SimCity. I was having so much fun kind of like building

223
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:52,745
these little worlds in Wettit that I started adding more and more features to it and making

224
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:55,826
it a little bit more automatic and a little bit kind of more satisfying.

225
00:11:57,152 --> 00:12:01,534
Now, back in those days, you know, we actually had memory maps, where we actually were very

226
00:12:01,534 --> 00:12:05,237
aware of, you know, where all the memory was in the machine, what we were doing with it.

227
00:12:05,237 --> 00:12:08,639
We didn't really allocate memory so much as we usurped it. You know, you just kind of

228
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,821
came in and said, I'm using that memory, and that memory, and that memory. The Commodore

229
00:12:11,821 --> 00:12:14,722
is kind of nice because you could basically map out all the ROM that you didn't need,

230
00:12:14,722 --> 00:12:18,705
which is mostly like the basic and the kernel and all that kind of stuff. And the one part

231
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:21,747
you didn't really want to use was this one 4K slice over here, which is where Vic and

232
00:12:21,747 --> 00:12:24,829
Sid lived, and you're using them all the time. But otherwise, we basically had, you know,

233
00:12:24,829 --> 00:12:26,310
about 60K free to kind of work with.

234
00:12:26,939 --> 00:12:29,340
And we would build these elaborate memory maps.

235
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,461
Pretty much this is standard the way games were programmed back then.

236
00:12:31,461 --> 00:12:34,183
And you knew exactly where every piece of code was, every piece of data,

237
00:12:34,183 --> 00:12:36,124
and it didn't move, because you put it there.

238
00:12:36,124 --> 00:12:37,404
And if you needed to put something new in there,

239
00:12:37,404 --> 00:12:39,405
you would basically find a little chunk, you'd move things around,

240
00:12:39,405 --> 00:12:40,686
and you'd kind of update it on the map.

241
00:12:40,686 --> 00:12:42,807
And so this is a continually evolving little map.

242
00:12:42,807 --> 00:12:46,749
And this is exactly the kind of way we thought about it.

243
00:12:46,749 --> 00:12:49,050
It was very to-the-metal programming.

244
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:52,331
To the point where memory was this incredible commodity.

245
00:12:52,331 --> 00:12:54,473
Toward the end of this project,

246
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:56,333
a lot of other people were working the same way.

247
00:12:56,754 --> 00:13:00,636
You know, you'd need five bytes or six bytes to do one cool little thing, and so you'd

248
00:13:00,636 --> 00:13:04,098
go scrounging around in memory. Even though I filled up every last byte in that machine,

249
00:13:04,098 --> 00:13:07,880
you'd start using tricks. Like, one trick was looking for a pair of JSR RTS pair like

250
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:12,623
this, which is actually jumping to a subroutine, and then when it comes back from that subroutine,

251
00:13:12,623 --> 00:13:16,205
it's returning back from the outer subroutine. You could replace that with a jump, in which

252
00:13:16,205 --> 00:13:20,627
case the RTS at the bottom of the first subroutine jumps you all the way back out, and you end

253
00:13:20,627 --> 00:13:24,869
up saving exactly one byte. So if you can find five of these pairs, you can actually

254
00:13:24,869 --> 00:13:25,770
get five bytes back.

255
00:13:26,308 --> 00:13:29,490
And we actually spent time doing this, hunting through the code, looking for little tricks

256
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:33,052
like this, you know, because I need 10 bytes now and 5 bytes here. And that's the, you

257
00:13:33,052 --> 00:13:35,993
know, amount to which we were utilizing all the memory in these machines. It was just

258
00:13:35,993 --> 00:13:40,015
kind of ridiculous. In fact, kind of after that, you know, second, third generation computers

259
00:13:40,015 --> 00:13:43,596
after that, I'd be talking to programmers and they'd be, you know, allocating a 10-byte

260
00:13:43,596 --> 00:13:47,518
record that we needed for whatever reason. But they said, oh, I can only allocate this

261
00:13:47,518 --> 00:13:51,120
as a 256-byte chunk. And it's like, oh, my God, you're wasting 240 bytes? You know, it's

262
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,042
almost like my grandparents that grew up in the Depression telling me about wasting food

263
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:55,422
or something.

264
00:13:56,218 --> 00:13:57,639
That's how I'd feel talking to these programmers.

265
00:13:57,639 --> 00:13:59,980
And it took me a while to kind of get out of that mindset.

266
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,021
OK, memory's cheap. Memory's cheap.

267
00:14:01,021 --> 00:14:03,062
You know, I had to keep repeating that to myself.

268
00:14:03,062 --> 00:14:05,403
So back to the world.

269
00:14:05,403 --> 00:14:09,585
So basically, I started drawing out this little world of islands and water.

270
00:14:09,585 --> 00:14:13,067
And this is the world I wanted to kind of build the game around.

271
00:14:13,067 --> 00:14:16,948
This is actually kind of a zoomed out version of what became the eventual world.

272
00:14:16,948 --> 00:14:19,209
This is about a hundred screens of data.

273
00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:22,791
So basically one screen was about that large, you know, as you're playing the game.

274
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,852
And the idea is that as you're flying this helicopter around...

275
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:29,373
this little thing is kind of panning over the map very smoothly and that was basically

276
00:14:29,373 --> 00:14:32,635
my core idea for how this game would work. I'm flying a helicopter over this world, it's

277
00:14:32,635 --> 00:14:35,798
going to scroll around smoothly and things will be coming after you. You know, that was

278
00:14:35,798 --> 00:14:40,121
about as deeply as I'd thought it out at that point. Now, I kind of got into this prototype

279
00:14:40,121 --> 00:14:45,045
phase where I was scrolling around this little world with my helicopter and I had little

280
00:14:45,045 --> 00:14:47,847
airplanes kind of chasing me down, firing missiles at me. You know, that was basically

281
00:14:47,847 --> 00:14:51,590
the game. And I had moved to California at that time and

282
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:55,702
you know, basically the Bay Area, and this is kind of like the center of the computer gaming universe at that time.

283
00:14:55,702 --> 00:14:57,563
About half the computer gaming companies were in the Bay Area.

284
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:02,807
And there were about five, I don't even remember, like, LunaSoft and a few others.

285
00:15:02,807 --> 00:15:05,310
And I ended up just kind of going to all the ones in the Bay Area,

286
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:08,692
kind of showing them my little prototype, saying, you know, what do you think of this game?

287
00:15:08,692 --> 00:15:10,374
And one of the ones I went to was Brøderbund.

288
00:15:10,374 --> 00:15:12,756
You know, this was way, way back in the early days.

289
00:15:12,756 --> 00:15:17,219
I met the Carlstons, Doug and Gary Carlston, and later Kathy joined a few years later.

290
00:15:17,219 --> 00:15:20,642
But at that time, Brøderbund Software was 17 people.

291
00:15:21,282 --> 00:15:25,663
They were running it actually out of an old liquor store in San Rafael that they had taken over.

292
00:15:25,663 --> 00:15:30,064
And it was really cute because in the back there was this freezer door and that's where the programmers lived.

293
00:15:30,064 --> 00:15:33,764
There were like five programmers and the programmers didn't like light, you know,

294
00:15:33,764 --> 00:15:36,745
and they'd open this giant freezer door and there'd be five programmers sitting back there.

295
00:15:36,745 --> 00:15:38,605
They'd turn the freezer off, of course.

296
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:43,546
But it was just like so quaint and, you know, there's these wonderful, you know,

297
00:15:43,546 --> 00:15:45,666
kind of family-run business in a way.

298
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:49,507
You know, they're kind of of Swedish descent, you know, these kind of wonderful, you know,

299
00:15:49,507 --> 00:15:50,507
peace-loving, very...

300
00:15:51,809 --> 00:15:57,632
Very nice people, and they were kind of horrified actually later to learn they had named their company after an extremist African apartheid group.

301
00:15:57,632 --> 00:16:05,517
But at any rate, other people I had met at Brøderbund, you know, of the 17, you know, Gene Portwood, who passed away about 10 years ago,

302
00:16:05,517 --> 00:16:09,879
was just a wonderful guy. He was really my first project manager on Mungling Bay.

303
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:14,021
He was a former Disney animator. He was the oldest guy at Brøderbund by far.

304
00:16:14,021 --> 00:16:17,823
You know, he was like in his 50s and everybody else was, you know, young 20-somethings.

305
00:16:17,823 --> 00:16:21,725
So he was this grizzled old veteran that was just, you know, incorrigible.

306
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:25,037
Later, his partner, Lauren Elliott, joined with him,

307
00:16:25,037 --> 00:16:27,199
and they both were working with me on both, you know,

308
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,180
Random Bungling Bay and on later Sim City.

309
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,202
These are the two guys that kind of later went off

310
00:16:31,202 --> 00:16:32,863
to go invent Carmen Sandiego

311
00:16:32,863 --> 00:16:34,044
and turn that into a giant hit.

312
00:16:34,044 --> 00:16:36,546
But the other person at Brøderbund that was kind of

313
00:16:36,546 --> 00:16:38,327
a huge influence on Random Bungling Bay

314
00:16:38,327 --> 00:16:40,729
was a guy named Alan Weiss, who was, you know,

315
00:16:40,729 --> 00:16:42,050
ran the testing group at Brøderbund.

316
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:44,052
The testing group, you know, was really three people

317
00:16:44,052 --> 00:16:46,314
or something like that, you know, three part-time people

318
00:16:46,314 --> 00:16:47,355
and then Alan full-time.

319
00:16:47,355 --> 00:16:50,477
So Alan is probably the only person that's played

320
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:53,611
And he would sit there and give me just like this great feedback about,

321
00:16:53,611 --> 00:16:55,712
oh, I think this is too hard, you know, we need to adjust this,

322
00:16:55,712 --> 00:16:56,312
that's too fast, etc.

323
00:16:56,312 --> 00:17:03,135
But really the person that probably gave me the most advice was Gary Carlston.

324
00:17:03,135 --> 00:17:05,857
Gary would spend so much time with me just talking about the market

325
00:17:05,857 --> 00:17:07,858
and where things were going and entertainment

326
00:17:07,858 --> 00:17:09,719
and stuff he learned about business.

327
00:17:09,719 --> 00:17:12,680
You know, I really felt like Gary Carlston was kind of my mentor for business.

328
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,841
And I just always appreciated the time he sat down, you know,

329
00:17:15,841 --> 00:17:18,783
for no apparent reason, he would just, you know, spend hours kind of...

330
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,222
telling me the way he saw the market developing,

331
00:17:21,222 --> 00:17:23,844
or the way he thought business should be run.

332
00:17:23,844 --> 00:17:27,167
Just a wonderful kind of learning experience,

333
00:17:27,167 --> 00:17:29,429
and I owe Gary a deep debt of gratitude

334
00:17:29,429 --> 00:17:32,291
for that time that he spent with me.

335
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:33,092
But back to the game.

336
00:17:33,092 --> 00:17:34,973
So at that point, we were starting to think,

337
00:17:34,973 --> 00:17:37,235
okay, we're going to start populating this world with targets.

338
00:17:37,235 --> 00:17:39,437
And at first, basically we were going to put down factories.

339
00:17:39,437 --> 00:17:41,318
And so Bungling Bay had six factories

340
00:17:41,318 --> 00:17:42,319
spread across these islands.

341
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:45,322
Now, basically I wanted this clockwork universe

342
00:17:45,322 --> 00:17:46,763
that we're going to build here.

343
00:17:47,172 --> 00:17:51,155
And so I had this idea in my mind that there were resources distributed out in this world

344
00:17:51,155 --> 00:17:54,858
that somehow the bungling empire, and we'll get into that later, is collecting.

345
00:17:54,858 --> 00:17:57,340
And they actually collect this with little boats that actually drive around,

346
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,622
and they actually go on these pre-programmed circuits,

347
00:17:59,622 --> 00:18:01,584
and they cycle back to little port areas.

348
00:18:01,584 --> 00:18:04,567
And they take these resources to these little tanks,

349
00:18:04,567 --> 00:18:07,589
which then carry the resources to the factories.

350
00:18:07,589 --> 00:18:12,273
And this is, you know, basically the underlying infrastructure of the bungling war machine.

351
00:18:13,076 --> 00:18:16,438
On top of that, we wanted to build their defensive networks.

352
00:18:16,438 --> 00:18:20,481
And so they have anti-aircraft guns spread out across the islands,

353
00:18:20,481 --> 00:18:21,281
radar dishes.

354
00:18:21,281 --> 00:18:26,585
The radar dishes actually call in airstrikes from two air bases that are in the world.

355
00:18:26,585 --> 00:18:29,106
And lastly, this battleship, which is kind of a long-term timer.

356
00:18:29,106 --> 00:18:31,588
At some point, the battleship is being constructed during the game.

357
00:18:31,588 --> 00:18:34,970
As you start bombing more factories, the construction accelerates.

358
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:37,892
Once it's completed, it actually steams out a port toward your carrier,

359
00:18:37,892 --> 00:18:39,273
which is sailing up and down this world.

360
00:18:39,273 --> 00:18:41,194
And if it ever gets to the carrier, you lose the carrier.

361
00:18:41,842 --> 00:18:44,302
and that's kind of part of the tension of the game.

362
00:18:44,302 --> 00:18:46,422
So basically we have this resource model

363
00:18:46,422 --> 00:18:48,943
where resources are being collected out in the water,

364
00:18:48,943 --> 00:18:50,303
brought by little boats, these little tanks,

365
00:18:50,303 --> 00:18:51,503
to the factories.

366
00:18:51,503 --> 00:18:53,584
Those resources are being spent on the defenses,

367
00:18:53,584 --> 00:18:54,744
and there's a priority system,

368
00:18:54,744 --> 00:18:57,524
where first they will rebuild any local anti-aircraft guns,

369
00:18:57,524 --> 00:18:59,124
then radar dishes,

370
00:18:59,124 --> 00:19:01,105
then any fighter jets or bombers,

371
00:19:01,105 --> 00:19:03,165
then the tanks, and lastly the boats.

372
00:19:03,165 --> 00:19:05,146
So there's basically a repair priority

373
00:19:05,146 --> 00:19:06,846
and a resource flow into that repair priority.

374
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:09,786
And this is the basic little mechanism of this world,

375
00:19:09,786 --> 00:19:11,387
this game, how it operated.

376
00:19:12,732 --> 00:19:13,513
Oh, okay.

377
00:19:13,513 --> 00:19:24,362
So, flight diversion.

378
00:19:24,362 --> 00:19:29,767
Believe me, it is hard to talk for an hour about a game that you can finish in ten minutes.

379
00:19:29,767 --> 00:19:32,429
So I did a little padding here.

380
00:19:32,429 --> 00:19:37,934
Outside of Moscow, there's this museum, the Museum of Cosmonautics.

381
00:19:37,934 --> 00:19:40,136
This is actually the roof of the museum.

382
00:19:40,136 --> 00:19:41,337
The museum's underneath this.

383
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:46,849
And there's a park outside of this where they basically have statues of the major heroes

384
00:19:46,849 --> 00:19:48,310
of the Soviet space program.

385
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:53,454
And the Soviet space program really has four consistent heroes that they always have statues

386
00:19:53,454 --> 00:19:54,795
of and monuments to.

387
00:19:54,795 --> 00:19:59,499
One was Sergei Korolev, the chief designer, who was basically their chief engineer that

388
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:01,261
architected their space program.

389
00:20:01,261 --> 00:20:04,223
Yuri Gagarin, of course, the first man in space.

390
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:07,025
Valentina Tereshkova, the first woman in space.

391
00:20:07,025 --> 00:20:10,628
And lastly, Alexei Leonov, who was the first guy to ever walk in space.

392
00:20:11,927 --> 00:20:15,549
Basically, I'm going to focus today on the Russian Space Minute on this last guy, Alexei Leonov.

393
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:22,033
Now, in addition to being the first guy to walk in space, he was also the commander of the Apollo-Soyuz test project,

394
00:20:22,033 --> 00:20:25,155
you know, the first time that an American and Soviet spacecraft had docked in orbit.

395
00:20:25,155 --> 00:20:27,717
And he was training to be the first cosmonaut on the Moon,

396
00:20:27,717 --> 00:20:30,178
back when the Soviets were actually pursuing their lunar program.

397
00:20:30,178 --> 00:20:33,481
He actually flew on the Vostok 2, or Voskhod 2, excuse me,

398
00:20:33,481 --> 00:20:36,923
which was a slight modification of the Vostok.

399
00:20:36,923 --> 00:20:39,965
He made the first six Soviet spaceflights.

400
00:20:39,965 --> 00:20:41,806
The one with Yuri Gagarin was the first one.

401
00:20:42,234 --> 00:20:46,137
were all in a Vostok. And it was a one-person capsule. And the reason it was a one-person

402
00:20:46,137 --> 00:20:50,260
capsule was that when it was coming down from orbit, they didn't really have the capability

403
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:54,323
to have a soft landing. This thing smashed into the earth really, really hard. And what

404
00:20:54,323 --> 00:20:57,486
most people didn't know, they didn't know back then, and it wasn't until many years

405
00:20:57,486 --> 00:21:02,449
later they found out, was that he was actually ejecting from the capsule on its way through

406
00:21:02,449 --> 00:21:06,452
reentry. So when the capsule was coming through about 30,000 feet in the air, what would happen

407
00:21:06,452 --> 00:21:11,196
is this ejection seat would fire him out of the capsule, and it was a very elaborate ejection

408
00:21:11,196 --> 00:21:12,077
seat.

409
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:16,758
After that came down to about 10,000 feet, he would actually jump out of that and then

410
00:21:16,758 --> 00:21:17,838
open a parachute.

411
00:21:17,838 --> 00:21:21,660
So the first six cosmonauts that went into orbit were actually landing by parachute while

412
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:24,702
their spacecraft crashed about 10 kilometers away.

413
00:21:24,702 --> 00:21:27,683
This ejection thing was just amazingly complicated.

414
00:21:27,683 --> 00:21:31,024
I actually got to talk to one of the engineers who designed it.

415
00:21:31,024 --> 00:21:33,686
And the amount of redundancies and fail-safes in this thing were extraordinary.

416
00:21:33,686 --> 00:21:34,486
It was all mechanical.

417
00:21:34,486 --> 00:21:37,728
They basically had mechanical computers embedded in this thing to detect if it was landing

418
00:21:37,728 --> 00:21:39,468
on water or if the cosmonaut was knocked out.

419
00:21:39,468 --> 00:21:42,030
They had no idea what the state of the cosmonaut would be coming back from orbit.

420
00:21:42,532 --> 00:21:45,273
So they had all these automatic things that would push him out of the seat and cause this

421
00:21:45,273 --> 00:21:46,813
parachute to open if he was unconscious.

422
00:21:46,813 --> 00:21:49,434
And when he was explaining all this stuff to me, I was kind of asking him, how do you

423
00:21:49,434 --> 00:21:49,774
test this?

424
00:21:49,774 --> 00:21:52,295
And this seat was also used for launch aborts.

425
00:21:52,295 --> 00:21:55,256
Basically if the rocket was about to blow up on the launch pad, they could fire them

426
00:21:55,256 --> 00:21:58,518
out of this and it would basically, the idea is it could safely land the cosmonaut from

427
00:21:58,518 --> 00:21:59,018
the launch pad.

428
00:21:59,018 --> 00:22:03,059
And he said they built a tower, same height as the launch pad, as the rocket on the launch

429
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:06,961
pad, and they built a launcher that would basically, you know, test this thing and find

430
00:22:06,961 --> 00:22:09,182
out how many of the crash dummies survived this.

431
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:12,071
And I asked him how many, you know, did they have to do to get it right?

432
00:22:12,071 --> 00:22:17,474
And he said, by the time they finished, there was this giant pile of prototypes underneath this launch apparatus.

433
00:22:17,474 --> 00:22:21,055
But at any rate, so the Voskhod, finally they got the landing right.

434
00:22:21,055 --> 00:22:24,697
They actually had retrorockets that would fire before the capsule landed.

435
00:22:24,697 --> 00:22:27,438
And so the next flight, which is now labeled the Voskhod 1,

436
00:22:27,438 --> 00:22:30,420
they crammed three cosmonauts just to see if they could do it.

437
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,620
And they made a successful flight.

438
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,701
They just basically went up, did a few orbits, and came down.

439
00:22:33,701 --> 00:22:35,882
And it was the first flight with more than one person in space.

440
00:22:35,882 --> 00:22:39,084
And it was the next Voskhod that Alexei went up on, the Voskhod 2.

441
00:22:39,572 --> 00:22:41,353
And what they did is they took out one of the passengers,

442
00:22:41,353 --> 00:22:44,734
and they used that extra room to attach this bizarre airlock device

443
00:22:44,734 --> 00:22:46,915
onto the side of the capsule.

444
00:22:46,915 --> 00:22:48,996
What it was, it was an inflatable airlock.

445
00:22:48,996 --> 00:22:51,136
They would get up in this space, inflate this thing,

446
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,677
and it would pop out like a balloon, basically.

447
00:22:53,677 --> 00:22:55,318
This is actually a ground prototype of it.

448
00:22:55,318 --> 00:22:58,939
And the cosmonaut would climb inside of this thing,

449
00:22:58,939 --> 00:23:00,520
close the hatch, and then they would decompress it.

450
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,161
They couldn't decompress their entire cabin like they did on Gemini,

451
00:23:03,161 --> 00:23:04,802
because all their electronics...

452
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,651
were basically very rudimentary air-cooled electronics.

453
00:23:07,651 --> 00:23:09,531
And the electronics would have overheated almost instantly

454
00:23:09,531 --> 00:23:11,532
had they depressurized the capsule.

455
00:23:11,532 --> 00:23:13,633
But anyway, that was kind of the plan.

456
00:23:13,633 --> 00:23:15,754
And so they launched in March 1965.

457
00:23:15,754 --> 00:23:18,875
They went up, you know, everything was pretty much normal.

458
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:21,176
Alexei kind of got in the airlock, depressurized,

459
00:23:21,176 --> 00:23:21,977
got out into space.

460
00:23:21,977 --> 00:23:23,477
As soon as he got into space,

461
00:23:23,477 --> 00:23:25,118
two very unexpected things happened.

462
00:23:25,118 --> 00:23:27,239
Now, first of all, realize that nobody had ever done this before

463
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,439
and they were only kind of guessing

464
00:23:28,439 --> 00:23:29,380
what the dynamics might be.

465
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,720
They hadn't really thought it through that much.

466
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,962
The first thing is that his suit inflated like a balloon.

467
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:37,201
they hadn't really considered the fact that he was in a vacuum, that he was full of air.

468
00:23:37,201 --> 00:23:39,942
The second thing is that he started overheating.

469
00:23:39,942 --> 00:23:44,324
This is about the first and only EVA suit that didn't have an integral cooling unit

470
00:23:44,324 --> 00:23:45,404
for the astronaut.

471
00:23:45,404 --> 00:23:49,205
All the astronauts now have this woven set of tubes that go across their body and circulate

472
00:23:49,205 --> 00:23:53,126
air to cool them because the amount of solar radiation you're receiving is tremendous.

473
00:23:53,126 --> 00:23:58,048
And so within a few minutes, you know, Alexei was basically out here like this, overheating,

474
00:23:58,048 --> 00:24:02,950
sweat was piling up in his space suit, and he realized he better get back in fast.

475
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:06,456
He managed to just barely kind of squeeze back into the airlock,

476
00:24:06,456 --> 00:24:08,477
but he couldn't get in feet first the way he was supposed to.

477
00:24:08,477 --> 00:24:11,437
He had to get in head first, the opposite way, which was totally unplanned.

478
00:24:11,437 --> 00:24:15,118
You know, at this point, he had actually lost several pounds from sweat,

479
00:24:15,118 --> 00:24:17,279
and it was pooling up around him inside the spacesuit.

480
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,099
But he did manage to get in the airlock,

481
00:24:19,099 --> 00:24:22,780
but the only way to close the hatch was to turn around inside that inflatable tube.

482
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,160
And he, you know, tried as he could.

483
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:28,201
He could not actually maneuver his body to turn around and do a 180 inside the tube.

484
00:24:28,201 --> 00:24:30,962
So his last kind of hope was to actually let air out of his suit.

485
00:24:31,357 --> 00:24:33,278
And so he actually started bleeding air out of his suit

486
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:34,919
to the point where he was almost losing consciousness.

487
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:37,021
And he got the pressure low enough to where he could bend

488
00:24:37,021 --> 00:24:39,683
his body around and close the hatch, which is lucky because,

489
00:24:39,683 --> 00:24:42,926
in fact, the other cosmonaut was given orders that if he

490
00:24:42,926 --> 00:24:45,508
couldn't get back in, that he was to jettison the airlock

491
00:24:45,508 --> 00:24:47,490
with Alexei in it and come back safely himself.

492
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:49,691
And, in fact, Alexei had a suicide pill with him in that

493
00:24:49,691 --> 00:24:50,292
case of that happening.

494
00:24:50,292 --> 00:24:52,394
But, at any rate, they did make it back in.

495
00:24:52,394 --> 00:24:55,176
And, you know, at that point, they were ready for reentry.

496
00:24:55,176 --> 00:24:58,539
And after they fired their reentry boosters, another

497
00:24:58,539 --> 00:24:59,940
problem happened where the

498
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,422
this service module, this kind of back portion,

499
00:25:02,422 --> 00:25:03,223
didn't separate.

500
00:25:03,223 --> 00:25:05,384
The straps didn't come apart the way they were supposed to.

501
00:25:05,384 --> 00:25:06,285
So the dynamics of this,

502
00:25:06,285 --> 00:25:07,786
coming into the atmosphere, were totally backwards.

503
00:25:07,786 --> 00:25:10,368
And in fact, the hatch was facing downward,

504
00:25:10,368 --> 00:25:11,129
not the heat shield.

505
00:25:11,129 --> 00:25:12,990
And so they were starting to see smoke

506
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:14,211
coming in through the hatch.

507
00:25:14,211 --> 00:25:15,052
The thing was rumbling.

508
00:25:15,052 --> 00:25:15,952
But around that time,

509
00:25:15,952 --> 00:25:17,914
the straps finally burned through,

510
00:25:17,914 --> 00:25:20,055
and it reoriented itself correctly

511
00:25:20,055 --> 00:25:21,316
just before the seals in the hatch blew.

512
00:25:21,316 --> 00:25:23,618
So they basically kind of made it through that.

513
00:25:23,618 --> 00:25:25,540
But that reentry profile was radically different,

514
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,480
which means that they landed

515
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,742
several hundred miles off course in the Ural Mountains.

516
00:25:29,288 --> 00:25:32,851
When the spaceship landed, it landed between two trees, actually jamming the hatch shut.

517
00:25:32,851 --> 00:25:35,473
They spent about an hour rocking the capsule back and forth.

518
00:25:35,473 --> 00:25:37,634
Nobody knew where they were at this point.

519
00:25:37,634 --> 00:25:40,637
But they managed to rock it out between these two trees enough to open the hatch,

520
00:25:40,637 --> 00:25:43,599
at which point, you know, it was getting dark, cold, it was, you know, very, very cold.

521
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:44,820
They had to make a campfire.

522
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:49,143
And then the wolves started closing in.

523
00:25:49,143 --> 00:25:53,526
But, luckily, a helicopter crew found them and dropped some paratroopers

524
00:25:53,526 --> 00:25:55,948
about ten hours later as daylight was breaking.

525
00:25:56,483 --> 00:26:00,705
And it was after that mission, every single Russian space flight after this,

526
00:26:00,705 --> 00:26:02,305
they give the cosmonauts guns and vodka.

527
00:26:02,305 --> 00:26:04,566
Just such an eventuality.

528
00:26:04,566 --> 00:26:08,567
And that was what really started that whole tradition.

529
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:11,028
Alexei was also the commander of the Apollo-Soyuz test project

530
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:12,388
and met the astronauts for the first time.

531
00:26:12,388 --> 00:26:15,909
This was the first time the Soviet cosmonauts actually met the American astronauts.

532
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:18,190
And he said that when he met the American astronauts,

533
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:21,051
it was amazing because the American astronauts were all 10 years older,

534
00:26:21,051 --> 00:26:23,311
college educated, with master's degrees,

535
00:26:23,311 --> 00:26:25,712
whereas the Russians were like these young yahoos out of the Air Force.

536
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:29,760
And it was really a kind of, not just a cultural mismatch,

537
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,862
but almost a generational mismatch as well.

538
00:26:31,862 --> 00:26:34,023
As I said, he was actually going to be,

539
00:26:34,023 --> 00:26:38,946
because of his EVA experience, the first cosmonaut on the moon,

540
00:26:38,946 --> 00:26:41,707
their lunar lander was actually designed to only land one person,

541
00:26:41,707 --> 00:26:44,909
and it required a fairly risky EVA even to get into it up in orbit.

542
00:26:44,909 --> 00:26:48,151
But the Soviets never perfected the N1, which is their giant moon booster.

543
00:26:48,151 --> 00:26:49,912
You know, they tried four test launches,

544
00:26:49,912 --> 00:26:52,513
every one exploded before going too far.

545
00:26:52,513 --> 00:26:55,935
In fact, it was the largest explosion, non-nuclear explosion, ever recorded.

546
00:26:56,322 --> 00:26:59,163
on Earth was the N1 booster blowing up on the launch pad.

547
00:26:59,163 --> 00:27:03,004
But Alexei also is a kind of interesting guy because he's an artist.

548
00:27:03,004 --> 00:27:06,366
He does fine art, he does space art, he does landscapes.

549
00:27:06,366 --> 00:27:08,846
And for a general in the Russian Air Force,

550
00:27:08,846 --> 00:27:12,688
he's kind of an amazingly interesting, well-rounded guy.

551
00:27:12,688 --> 00:27:15,349
The spaceship in 2010 was actually named after him, the Leonov.

552
00:27:15,349 --> 00:27:17,569
And I had the privilege to actually get to know him a bit.

553
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:21,130
He actually came and stayed at my house for a week a few years ago.

554
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:23,211
And he's just an amazing, spunky guy.

555
00:27:23,211 --> 00:27:26,152
And he is just the feistiest character you could ever imagine.

556
00:27:26,897 --> 00:27:37,883
But, anyway, that's the story of Alexei Leonov. Back to Bungling Bay.

557
00:27:37,883 --> 00:27:41,305
So now we have this world with resources being collected,

558
00:27:41,305 --> 00:27:44,947
airstrips, air defenses, et cetera, et cetera.

559
00:27:44,947 --> 00:27:50,450
Now one thing that I found, you know, after Bungling Bay was released, kind of in the spirit of a post-mortem,

560
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:53,932
was that players totally got this repair priority. They kind of understood that,

561
00:27:53,932 --> 00:27:56,553
oh, I've got to get the guns fast. They're going to be rebuilt fast.

562
00:27:56,810 --> 00:28:00,713
that was totally transparent to the player. They had no idea about this resource flow

563
00:28:00,713 --> 00:28:04,956
thing. It was totally opaque to the players and pretty much wasted on people. They might

564
00:28:04,956 --> 00:28:09,059
have understood that these boats and tanks had something to do with it, but it was not

565
00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:13,021
clear at all what. Kind of thinking back on it, really I should have made the resources

566
00:28:13,021 --> 00:28:16,324
visible, because it was kind of a really stupid decision to make them invisible. I should

567
00:28:16,324 --> 00:28:19,386
have actually shown them out in the water with the ships picking them up, bringing them

568
00:28:19,386 --> 00:28:22,588
to the dock, having the tanks, bringing them to the factory, and actually seeing them converted.

569
00:28:22,986 --> 00:28:26,187
back into, you know, the components that they were rebuilding. I think that one change alone

570
00:28:26,187 --> 00:28:29,968
probably would have been the biggest improvement I can think of, looking back on it, that I

571
00:28:29,968 --> 00:28:34,750
would have made to Bungling Bay. Now, there was also kind of the difficulty level issue.

572
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:38,491
I didn't want to have a game with discrete levels. I wanted to have a game that was one

573
00:28:38,491 --> 00:28:43,193
coherent world. So instead what I chose to do was that depending on how many factories

574
00:28:43,193 --> 00:28:48,374
you destroyed, the defenses within that world would escalate. With six factories, you had

575
00:28:48,374 --> 00:28:51,515
pretty simple defenses, you know, simple anti-aircraft and a little bit of light.

576
00:28:51,801 --> 00:28:55,584
ground fire from the boats and the tanks. Once you destroyed one factory, the first

577
00:28:55,584 --> 00:28:59,647
jets appeared. They would start chasing around, firing missiles at your helicopter. Once you

578
00:28:59,647 --> 00:29:03,569
got to the fourth factory, bombers would appear. These bombers would attack your aircraft carrier.

579
00:29:03,569 --> 00:29:07,592
Third one, they would actually escalate some of the attacks. By the time you got to the

580
00:29:07,592 --> 00:29:12,216
two factories left, guided missiles would appear. And this battleship would start accelerating

581
00:29:12,216 --> 00:29:15,658
its construction. So the idea was that, you know, as you got further and further in the

582
00:29:15,658 --> 00:29:19,781
game, the game was pushing back on you harder and harder with this very dynamic spring tension.

583
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:23,382
And really the way I wanted to think about it was that, you know, I thought in the first

584
00:29:23,382 --> 00:29:27,184
game somebody should probably die before they've blown up one factory. By the second time they

585
00:29:27,184 --> 00:29:30,605
play the game they should get at least one factory. By maybe the fourth time they should

586
00:29:30,605 --> 00:29:34,607
get this far and so forth. So that by the time, you know, you got to the last factory

587
00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:38,048
you'd probably play the game, you know, 10, 15, 20 times to get that last one. And I think

588
00:29:38,048 --> 00:29:43,570
I pretty much achieved this pretty well. Because if you play Bungling Bay, it's that last factory

589
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:46,812
that's like half the game really. You can get like four or five down.

590
00:29:47,266 --> 00:29:50,728
in a few minutes pretty easily, but when you get to the last one, it gets really intense

591
00:29:50,728 --> 00:29:57,692
and the escalation of tension is pretty interesting. I'm going to show you a little bit of a video

592
00:29:57,692 --> 00:30:03,015
of Bungling Bay. This is actually done by some dude in Germany that actually finished

593
00:30:03,015 --> 00:30:07,298
the game in like ten minutes, but you'll get a little bit of a sense of it. It's got a

594
00:30:07,298 --> 00:30:11,581
full screen. I'm going to skip ahead to a couple of spots just to give you a sense of

595
00:30:11,581 --> 00:30:13,002
how this game looks and plays.

596
00:30:15,505 --> 00:30:19,188
I could be playing in an emulator right now, but this will be faster.

597
00:30:19,188 --> 00:30:19,488
There we go.

598
00:30:19,488 --> 00:30:20,669
So that's the carrier you're taking off from.

599
00:30:20,669 --> 00:30:24,953
That's one of the islands you're going over.

600
00:30:24,953 --> 00:30:29,917
One of the things that always annoyed me was this little line

601
00:30:29,917 --> 00:30:33,860
you might notice right above the text at the bottom.

602
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:36,122
You might see how it's kind of sitting there and

603
00:30:36,122 --> 00:30:36,702
flickering.

604
00:30:36,702 --> 00:30:39,965
That was this interrupt I was trying to do where I had to switch between

605
00:30:39,965 --> 00:30:44,628
the smooth scrolling graphics on the top and the fixed graphics on the bottom.

606
00:30:45,097 --> 00:30:46,097
And I never could get it right.

607
00:30:46,097 --> 00:30:47,918
It would always flicker no matter what I did.

608
00:30:47,918 --> 00:30:49,038
And I spent hours and hours trying to fix that.

609
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:51,620
It still annoys me, even seeing it right now.

610
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:56,942
But basically, what you just saw was an attack,

611
00:30:56,942 --> 00:30:58,563
and the helicopter was damaged.

612
00:30:58,563 --> 00:31:00,924
And I really like the idea that you're kind of limping back

613
00:31:00,924 --> 00:31:01,804
to the carrier all the time.

614
00:31:01,804 --> 00:31:04,885
And it kind of establishes this connection with the carrier

615
00:31:04,885 --> 00:31:06,586
that, you know, at first you're kind of on the offensive.

616
00:31:06,586 --> 00:31:07,387
You're going after them.

617
00:31:07,387 --> 00:31:08,487
I'm going to go get them.

618
00:31:08,487 --> 00:31:10,368
And all of a sudden, you get your butt kicked.

619
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:11,528
And, oh, no, where's mommy?

620
00:31:11,528 --> 00:31:11,628
And

621
00:31:12,414 --> 00:31:15,336
That was something that I really wanted to kind of replicate, you know, in the game,

622
00:31:15,336 --> 00:31:18,058
where you started developing this tight connection with the carrier,

623
00:31:18,058 --> 00:31:20,380
not only because that's where you can kind of repair,

624
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,101
but also you had a limited bomb load.

625
00:31:22,101 --> 00:31:24,843
So at some point, bombers start attacking the carrier.

626
00:31:24,843 --> 00:31:26,605
This is about two factories into it.

627
00:31:26,605 --> 00:31:29,007
And this periodically happens. It calls you back.

628
00:31:29,007 --> 00:31:30,668
You come rescue the carrier.

629
00:31:30,668 --> 00:31:32,169
You don't basically defend your carrier.

630
00:31:32,169 --> 00:31:35,371
What will happen is they'll sink it, and you'll be on your last helicopter,

631
00:31:35,371 --> 00:31:37,853
because you actually get, like, three helicopters for the whole game.

632
00:31:37,853 --> 00:31:40,475
So this is an example of kind of the attacks on the...

633
00:31:41,895 --> 00:31:43,936
carrier distracting you from your offensive duties.

634
00:31:43,936 --> 00:31:45,017
Let me go back to about here.

635
00:31:45,017 --> 00:31:47,678
Now at some point these heat-seeking missiles start appearing.

636
00:31:47,678 --> 00:31:53,261
That's the little missile that's chasing.

637
00:31:53,261 --> 00:31:56,403
This is really very much kind of an issue of

638
00:31:56,403 --> 00:31:59,485
tuning the missile turn rate and speed to the helicopter.

639
00:31:59,485 --> 00:32:01,286
If you had a fully repaired helicopter in full speed,

640
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:04,848
you could pretty much avoid these things by outmaneuvering them.

641
00:32:04,848 --> 00:32:06,189
But basically if you were slightly damaged,

642
00:32:06,189 --> 00:32:09,051
the heat-seeking missiles were just lethal.

643
00:32:09,051 --> 00:32:10,472
Now again, you see our speed slows down.

644
00:32:10,745 --> 00:32:12,965
At that point, the screens yellow were slightly damaged.

645
00:32:12,965 --> 00:32:15,026
There was also this kind of death spiral thing that was fun.

646
00:32:15,026 --> 00:32:19,667
That if you actually do this right, you still have a slight control over the helicopter

647
00:32:19,667 --> 00:32:20,288
when you're going down.

648
00:32:20,288 --> 00:32:24,909
And if you did it just right, you could land into a factory and blow it up as you're crashing.

649
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:31,391
And that kamikaze thing actually was very, very satisfying when you pulled it off,

650
00:32:31,391 --> 00:32:32,431
but it was very hard to pull off.

651
00:32:32,431 --> 00:32:37,253
Now, at some point, as I mentioned, that spring tension, as you get further and further,

652
00:32:37,253 --> 00:32:37,753
I think we're down to one.

653
00:32:37,753 --> 00:32:40,013
Now, at this point, the battleship is leaving port.

654
00:32:40,637 --> 00:32:43,178
you can actually slow its construction down by attacking it,

655
00:32:43,178 --> 00:32:45,320
but once it's been built, it's firing heat-seeking missiles,

656
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,582
and it's pretty much almost impossible to destroy.

657
00:32:48,582 --> 00:32:50,784
It is possible, but it's almost not even worth it.

658
00:32:50,784 --> 00:32:53,126
Once it leaves, it's basically a timer being set.

659
00:32:53,126 --> 00:32:55,888
It's gonna be about three minutes before it actually gets to your carrier and sinks it.

660
00:32:55,888 --> 00:33:00,351
And so, at that point, you know, either you're on your last factory,

661
00:33:00,351 --> 00:33:02,453
and you can see, in fact, he is on his last factory.

662
00:33:02,453 --> 00:33:03,714
It's factory one down here.

663
00:33:03,714 --> 00:33:07,156
And so this is really kind of a push in the endgame.

664
00:33:07,156 --> 00:33:10,178
In fact, this guy finished the entire game in about 12 minutes.

665
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:16,395
And of those 12 minutes, about six of them were with one factory left.

666
00:33:16,395 --> 00:33:20,119
You know, this again is one factory left.

667
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:25,664
Now, at this point, just kind of the intensity of the jet attacks, guided missiles, etc.,

668
00:33:25,664 --> 00:33:36,353
the rate of guided missiles start going up as well.

669
00:33:36,353 --> 00:33:37,915
Now, at this point, he's got two left.

670
00:33:38,528 --> 00:33:42,210
The factories would also repair a little faster on the last factory.

671
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:45,031
So you could never really destroy it with one bomb load.

672
00:33:45,031 --> 00:33:49,132
You actually had to go back with several bomb loads to attack it.

673
00:33:49,132 --> 00:33:50,493
And let me pause that here.

674
00:33:50,493 --> 00:33:55,775
So you get some sense of kind of the escalation path that was going on here.

675
00:33:55,775 --> 00:34:01,257
Now, Brøderbund being, you know, peaceful living Swedes and all that,

676
00:34:01,257 --> 00:34:04,798
were a little, you know, not really kind of against violent shoot-'em-ups,

677
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:06,999
but they wanted to kind of soften them at every step.

678
00:34:06,999 --> 00:34:07,139
So...

679
00:34:07,486 --> 00:34:09,006
With Bungling Bay, they kept thinking about,

680
00:34:09,006 --> 00:34:10,687
okay, how do we make this not killing people?

681
00:34:10,687 --> 00:34:11,907
How do we make it not killing people?

682
00:34:11,907 --> 00:34:13,467
And so they took the, you know,

683
00:34:13,467 --> 00:34:15,668
really creative solution of let's make them robots.

684
00:34:15,668 --> 00:34:18,028
It's a machine, yet it lives.

685
00:34:18,028 --> 00:34:19,468
Yeah, this is their box design.

686
00:34:19,468 --> 00:34:21,849
It defends itself.

687
00:34:21,849 --> 00:34:24,609
It is programmed for survival.

688
00:34:24,609 --> 00:34:27,690
It is programmed to destroy.

689
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,310
When I first saw this box design,

690
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:32,371
it was like, oh my God, what did you do to this box?

691
00:34:32,371 --> 00:34:36,692
It was like the ugliest thing I had ever seen.

692
00:34:37,832 --> 00:34:39,834
But they'd actually done this on previous games.

693
00:34:39,834 --> 00:34:42,595
Radon Bungling Bay was like actually the third game

694
00:34:42,595 --> 00:34:44,096
in which the Bungling Empire appeared.

695
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:46,618
That was the name of the bad guys in Choplifter,

696
00:34:46,618 --> 00:34:47,699
and then later, Lode Runner.

697
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:49,760
And these games became known as the Bungling Trilogy.

698
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,922
So the Bunglings kind of became their stand-in robotic

699
00:34:52,922 --> 00:34:56,164
opponents so that they weren't actually killing real people.

700
00:34:56,164 --> 00:34:59,666
These three games were also the first three American games

701
00:34:59,666 --> 00:35:02,228
that were licensed to the Nintendo operating system,

702
00:35:02,228 --> 00:35:03,489
the very first 8-bit Nintendo in Japan.

703
00:35:03,489 --> 00:35:06,731
And that was kind of interesting, what happened.

704
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:12,813
They basically reprogrammed it for the Nintendo, which was also a 6502 based system, and the

705
00:35:12,813 --> 00:35:14,793
MSX, which is this computer standard in Japan.

706
00:35:14,793 --> 00:35:17,574
And I played very similar.

707
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:19,794
They had a couple of enhancements on the NES.

708
00:35:19,794 --> 00:35:23,735
The early NES for some reason had a microphone on the controller, and you could actually

709
00:35:23,735 --> 00:35:29,016
yell into the microphone and cause things to happen, like airstrikes.

710
00:35:29,016 --> 00:35:35,258
The C64 version sold on the Commodore 64 in America, and back in the time piracy was incredibly

711
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:35,618
rampant.

712
00:35:36,022 --> 00:35:38,223
In fact, I spent, you know, just huge amounts of time

713
00:35:38,223 --> 00:35:40,905
doing weird, bizarre copy protection things.

714
00:35:40,905 --> 00:35:42,226
And everything the Commodore did, you know,

715
00:35:42,226 --> 00:35:44,648
one of the big tricks was that the 1541 Commodore drive

716
00:35:44,648 --> 00:35:47,090
actually had its own processor, its own 6502 in it.

717
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:49,312
And you could download code into the disk drive

718
00:35:49,312 --> 00:35:51,333
and have it run kind of covertly

719
00:35:51,333 --> 00:35:53,935
and do a checksum on the computer's code.

720
00:35:53,935 --> 00:35:57,077
And so a lot of the copy protection that we were writing

721
00:35:57,077 --> 00:35:59,820
was either disk read errors

722
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,841
that were, you know, printed on the disk at the manufacturer

723
00:36:01,841 --> 00:36:04,163
or it was these weird little Trojan horse programs

724
00:36:04,163 --> 00:36:05,844
that you downloaded into the disk drive and were running.

725
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:08,592
And I spent hours just kind of wasting my time

726
00:36:08,592 --> 00:36:10,373
writing weird copy protection schemes,

727
00:36:10,373 --> 00:36:12,574
which was basically, you know, wasted time

728
00:36:12,574 --> 00:36:14,916
because, you know, it just delayed the hackers

729
00:36:14,916 --> 00:36:17,197
by maybe two days before a cracked version appeared.

730
00:36:17,197 --> 00:36:18,278
Once it appeared, it was everywhere.

731
00:36:18,278 --> 00:36:19,739
And that was just kind of the way things were

732
00:36:19,739 --> 00:36:21,260
back in those days.

733
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,521
We never really had hard metrics,

734
00:36:22,521 --> 00:36:23,722
but it was very interesting

735
00:36:23,722 --> 00:36:25,683
because a lot of people I know that, you know,

736
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:27,364
had a Commodore back in those days

737
00:36:27,364 --> 00:36:29,305
had played Great Armageddon Bay,

738
00:36:29,305 --> 00:36:31,266
and we actually ended up selling only 20,000 units

739
00:36:31,266 --> 00:36:32,747
on the Commodore.

740
00:36:32,747 --> 00:36:33,848
Now, the Nintendo in Japan,

741
00:36:33,848 --> 00:36:36,270
which had about the same installed base, roughly.

742
00:36:36,637 --> 00:36:41,999
as the C64 did in the US. Because it was a cartridge system, there was virtually no piracy.

743
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:47,302
So the same game on the similar install base in Japan sold about 800,000 units. So about

744
00:36:47,302 --> 00:36:53,365
40x. So almost all the money I made from ran up Bung Lee Bay came from Japan and in fact

745
00:36:53,365 --> 00:36:57,326
kind of funded Maxis and how we got Maxis off the ground in the early days. And that

746
00:36:57,326 --> 00:37:00,008
was true of a lot of other game developers as well.

747
00:37:00,008 --> 00:37:02,969
Brøderbund kind of noticed this. They got very interested and in fact kind of...

748
00:37:03,653 --> 00:37:07,015
organized a couple of trips where they took all of us over to Japan in 1984 right as the

749
00:37:07,015 --> 00:37:10,716
Japanese game market was kind of exploding. And it was really eye-opening experience to

750
00:37:10,716 --> 00:37:14,958
kind of go over there and kind of see your stuff on Japanese shelves in a different language

751
00:37:14,958 --> 00:37:18,039
and also just the amount of them because, you know, nobody's pirating them so the stores

752
00:37:18,039 --> 00:37:20,960
were stocked with just, you know, piles of these things and people were buying them by

753
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:26,462
the tens of thousands. And it was interesting after that, you know, I started kind of thinking,

754
00:37:26,462 --> 00:37:31,344
you know, what do I want to work on next, you know? And, you know, of course as I mentioned

755
00:37:31,344 --> 00:37:31,704
I took...

756
00:37:32,298 --> 00:37:35,319
the editing of that world, the building of that world was really one of the satisfying

757
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:39,720
parts of SimCity, I mean of Radar Mongolia Bay for me. And so that's when I started slowly

758
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:44,382
evolving Wedit into what became the very first version of SimCity, which was on the Commodore.

759
00:37:44,382 --> 00:37:48,043
Most people have never seen, most people think of the Macintosh and the Amiga as the first

760
00:37:48,043 --> 00:37:51,485
versions of SimCity, which in fact were the second generation of SimCity. The very first

761
00:37:51,485 --> 00:37:54,726
generation was programmed on the Commodore 64. It was a much simpler game, but I actually

762
00:37:54,726 --> 00:37:58,607
had to write kind of a little multitasking operating system to get it to run on the Commodore,

763
00:37:58,607 --> 00:38:00,628
because there were some of the routines that were incredibly

764
00:38:01,223 --> 00:38:05,386
slow to run, like the PowerScan. But in SimCity, you know, I was working on that right around

765
00:38:05,386 --> 00:38:09,648
the time the first GUIs were coming out on the Macintosh or whatever. So I decided, oh,

766
00:38:09,648 --> 00:38:14,070
I'm going to design a fancy GUI on the Commodore. And that was my attempt at a graphic operating

767
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:17,571
system, these little icons at the bottom. And I thought it was like so cool at the time,

768
00:38:17,571 --> 00:38:22,554
too cool for school. But every game, every version of SimCity after that has had helicopters

769
00:38:22,554 --> 00:38:27,116
in it. And it's just kind of a thing that, you know, we have to have helicopters in every

770
00:38:27,116 --> 00:38:29,197
version of SimCity, you know. That's kind of where it came from.

771
00:38:29,733 --> 00:38:34,135
Now, Brøderbund actually worked with us when we were starting Maxis,

772
00:38:34,135 --> 00:38:37,336
and we were an affiliate publisher with Brøderbund for many years.

773
00:38:37,336 --> 00:38:38,936
Again, they kind of helped get us off the ground

774
00:38:38,936 --> 00:38:40,417
until we kind of later went our own way.

775
00:38:40,417 --> 00:38:41,918
We did an IPO.

776
00:38:41,918 --> 00:38:44,499
Eventually, EA swooped in, bought Maxis.

777
00:38:44,499 --> 00:38:45,279
Brøderbund continued.

778
00:38:45,279 --> 00:38:48,240
A few years later, Brøderbund actually tried to buy The Learning Company,

779
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,401
which is another big game company.

780
00:38:49,401 --> 00:38:53,142
They actually got outbid by this distributor called SoftKey,

781
00:38:53,142 --> 00:38:55,463
which actually ended up buying The Learning Company from underneath Brøderbund.

782
00:38:55,463 --> 00:38:57,404
And because The Learning Company sounds so much cooler,

783
00:38:57,404 --> 00:38:59,505
they ended up adopting the name, becoming a bigger company.

784
00:38:59,956 --> 00:39:02,137
and then in a funny reversal, they ended up buying Brudderbund.

785
00:39:02,137 --> 00:39:07,199
Until a few years later, Mattel swooped in and bought the both of them

786
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:10,461
for some huge amount of money. I forgot what the number was.

787
00:39:10,461 --> 00:39:13,222
But then a few years later, they decided it was a boondoggle, so they got rid of it.

788
00:39:13,222 --> 00:39:16,004
They brought in this corporate liquidator that took the two

789
00:39:16,004 --> 00:39:18,265
and then kind of chopped it up and sold part of it to Ubisoft,

790
00:39:18,265 --> 00:39:19,746
part of it to this company called Riverdeep,

791
00:39:19,746 --> 00:39:23,267
which I think is the company that now actually owns the title of Brudderbund,

792
00:39:23,267 --> 00:39:25,728
and they still publish Print Shop and stuff like that.

793
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:30,663
But later on in my career, I kind of stayed into helicopters, did a game called SimCopter,

794
00:39:30,663 --> 00:39:35,586
which had some interesting exploits in it. If you ever finished SimCopter, you actually

795
00:39:35,586 --> 00:39:39,748
got to see the famous alien scene, too. But later on, you know, I'd always kind of go

796
00:39:39,748 --> 00:39:43,110
back and I started tuning into the emulator scene. And every now and then, like every

797
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:45,852
five years or so, I would, you know, pull down an emulator and play an old version of

798
00:39:45,852 --> 00:39:49,233
Raid on Bungling Bay. And it was just kind of amazing to me that, you know, I can now

799
00:39:49,233 --> 00:39:52,995
play this game in an emulator and it was, you know, exactly what I had done. And it

800
00:39:52,995 --> 00:39:53,876
was very nostalgic for me.

801
00:39:54,395 --> 00:39:58,417
At some point I started looking around and I started realizing that people were reprogramming

802
00:39:58,417 --> 00:40:02,740
the game on their own. Just recreating it. And it just kind of blew me away. Like, what

803
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:08,044
the hell is this? This is why I just want to show you because it was just like some

804
00:40:08,044 --> 00:40:12,747
kid in Kansas or something just decided he, you know, wanted Bungling Bay to look better

805
00:40:12,747 --> 00:40:18,991
so he redid it. I'll actually run it for you here for a minute. And it's actually fun to

806
00:40:18,991 --> 00:40:23,594
play. I have a couple issues with the way he tuned the helicopter dynamics.

807
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:29,472
But otherwise, graphically, it's gorgeous compared to my original.

808
00:40:29,472 --> 00:40:36,714
It's got some cool little tilting going on with the helicopter, much better sound effects.

809
00:40:36,714 --> 00:40:41,295
It's got these cool little radar panels where the radars protect you.

810
00:40:41,295 --> 00:40:44,316
It's actually kind of a 3D parallax on the building, as you can see.

811
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:47,836
It actually is kind of a 3D world, even though I'm only navigating in two dimensions.

812
00:40:49,357 --> 00:40:53,419
But the fact that fans are basically building things that are far superior to the original

813
00:40:53,419 --> 00:40:55,200
as tributes just blows me away.

814
00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:00,763
I still suck at this game, so I'm not going to embarrass myself by showing you how bad I am at this.

815
00:41:00,763 --> 00:41:06,286
One other thing, he didn't put in the cool thing where you could land on the board with Airbus.

816
00:41:06,286 --> 00:41:11,109
So I've been actually trying to contact him and tell him about a couple little improvements

817
00:41:11,109 --> 00:41:13,470
that would really make this game kick ass.

818
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,202
Then after that, I was looking on the web some more, and I found...

819
00:41:19,202 --> 00:41:20,943
Oop, I don't want to do that.

820
00:41:20,943 --> 00:41:25,686
I found that people were doing more stylized versions of Bungling Bay.

821
00:41:25,686 --> 00:41:27,067
This is not the only recreation of it.

822
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:30,449
One guy actually did a full 3D version of Bungling Bay

823
00:41:30,449 --> 00:41:32,811
that she could play from the helicopter's point of view,

824
00:41:32,811 --> 00:41:33,792
heads-up display, etc.

825
00:41:33,792 --> 00:41:36,373
And, you know, it kind of amazes me

826
00:41:36,373 --> 00:41:39,876
that things that used to be done by us as professional game designers

827
00:41:39,876 --> 00:41:42,677
are now things that, you know, 12-year-old kids are doing, you know,

828
00:41:42,677 --> 00:41:44,198
as part of their computer science class.

829
00:41:45,483 --> 00:41:50,205
And I think it's very cool, too, the fact that kind of these ideas that started these

830
00:41:50,205 --> 00:41:53,786
like little germs can kind of live on in people's imagination. And as I showed you that very

831
00:41:53,786 --> 00:41:57,368
first slide, you know, when I think of Bungling Bay, this is what I remember. In fact, it's

832
00:41:57,368 --> 00:42:00,849
kind of coming true automatically. It is going to become that over time. You know, I'm sure

833
00:42:00,849 --> 00:42:04,891
people are just going to keep remaking these old games like this. But that's the end of

834
00:42:04,891 --> 00:42:10,213
my prepared talk. I think I actually, for the first time in my life, have a few minutes

835
00:42:10,213 --> 00:42:11,293
for questions. So, thank you.

836
00:42:15,534 --> 00:42:27,685
So I guess the microphones, if anybody wants to ask a question, just go up to one of these microphones in the aisles here.

837
00:42:27,685 --> 00:42:28,205
Howdy.

838
00:42:28,205 --> 00:42:32,869
So, in the original Commodore 64 version, I found a reproducible bug.

839
00:42:32,869 --> 00:42:34,971
I'll get right on that, yeah.

840
00:42:34,971 --> 00:42:43,638
If you kamikaze your last helicopter into the last factory for critical damage, the game horks because it doesn't know if you've won or lost.

841
00:42:44,547 --> 00:42:46,068
Oh, you mean it freezes.

842
00:42:46,068 --> 00:42:50,590
Yeah. It's a full crash, and so I was just wondering when the patch was going to come out.

843
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:59,414
Well, thank you for reminding me, because the one thing I didn't show you was what happens when you win the game,

844
00:42:59,414 --> 00:43:03,255
which a lot of people never saw, so I'm going to skip ahead into this movie a little bit,

845
00:43:03,255 --> 00:43:06,797
because this is like my forte of graphics programming, and let's see, it's about 50, yeah.

846
00:43:06,797 --> 00:43:11,459
So right about here in this little movie thing, he actually wins.

847
00:43:13,612 --> 00:43:14,772
I'll just take a second, you can watch it.

848
00:43:14,772 --> 00:43:21,176
And then the whole game goes into a kind of this, it pauses and then goes into slow motion.

849
00:43:21,176 --> 00:43:27,240
Now I said that basically the entire game was about 80K, you know, we only had 60K of

850
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,000
memory.

851
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,102
That other 20K was actually the loading screen and the wind screen.

852
00:43:31,102 --> 00:43:37,846
And it was funny because back in those days programmers would spend, you know, a month

853
00:43:37,846 --> 00:43:39,967
working on the wind screen or the loading screen.

854
00:43:40,469 --> 00:43:44,352
and sell it on that. So here's basically the daily news.

855
00:43:44,352 --> 00:43:48,035
And depending on your victory, you've got different headlines here. You've either got a marginal victory, a decisive victory.

856
00:43:48,035 --> 00:43:52,599
So the headlines would actually change depending on how well you had played the game.

857
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:59,064
And at this point, oh and then we get the victory celebration. Do you ever see the Calvin and Hobbes cartoon where he gets an A

858
00:43:59,064 --> 00:44:00,505
somehow one day on a math test?

859
00:44:00,505 --> 00:44:06,510
And then he imagines in his mind this giant parade, ticker tapes, and he's going through the streets. Calvin is a genius.

860
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:08,231
That's what I was kind of thinking here.

861
00:44:08,231 --> 00:44:09,412
So you basically get this little.

862
00:44:11,877 --> 00:44:21,044
guy with a parade of fireworks. Yeah, I know it's not impressive. But this is what happened

863
00:44:21,044 --> 00:44:38,279
if you wanted to write a book like that. More questions? Or was it all self-explanatory?

864
00:44:38,279 --> 00:44:40,981
I got most of that.

865
00:44:42,248 --> 00:44:44,730
I got stupid happy. Yeah, go to the microphone.

866
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:45,291
Is that the end guy?

867
00:44:45,291 --> 00:44:48,193
No, just don't mic one of the chimp, I can be smarter.

868
00:44:48,193 --> 00:45:00,422
Hey, good to see you again and I just wanted to find out how things are going with SuperHappy and what are you going to do to innovate offline, online that others aren't?

869
00:45:00,422 --> 00:45:03,664
I didn't, still didn't get the last thing about the offline, online.

870
00:45:03,664 --> 00:45:10,529
Well, because you remember you talked last time, we talked about what you guys were looking at.

871
00:45:11,243 --> 00:45:16,305
with gaming and real world problems and online, offline, along with the robots and other stuff,

872
00:45:16,305 --> 00:45:18,667
you know, but where do you see some real ventures?

873
00:45:18,667 --> 00:45:20,908
Well, first of all, it's the Stupid Fun Club, not the Stupid Happy Club.

874
00:45:20,908 --> 00:45:21,288
Oh, I'm sorry.

875
00:45:21,288 --> 00:45:24,389
Stupid Happy Club makes no sense.

876
00:45:24,389 --> 00:45:26,531
Well, I'm always happy when I'm stupid, but you know.

877
00:45:26,531 --> 00:45:27,131
Okay, that's just me.

878
00:45:27,131 --> 00:45:30,473
Yeah, Stupid Fun Club, I mean, we're doing several projects.

879
00:45:30,473 --> 00:45:32,994
Most of them I can't talk about right now, a couple of which I can, actually.

880
00:45:32,994 --> 00:45:37,436
One of them is a crowd-sourced television show that some of you may have heard of.

881
00:45:37,436 --> 00:45:38,857
It's on Current TV called Bar Karma.

882
00:45:38,857 --> 00:45:40,978
And we actually have thousands of people.

883
00:45:41,314 --> 00:45:45,916
submitting storylines and then collaboratively working on storylines and voting on their

884
00:45:45,916 --> 00:45:50,318
favorite storylines that through this pipeline process we take these storyboards, kind of

885
00:45:50,318 --> 00:45:54,260
like graphic novels that the players have made, and give them to the production team.

886
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:57,842
And they actually go out and shoot with real actors on a real set, you know, pretty high

887
00:45:57,842 --> 00:46:02,424
production standards, shoot an episode every week based upon crowdsourced submission of

888
00:46:02,424 --> 00:46:06,866
ideas and in fact down to the scene level, how the scenes go in the plots. So that's

889
00:46:06,866 --> 00:46:09,547
one of them. We're also doing a lot of kind of fun toy stuff.

890
00:46:10,153 --> 00:46:12,014
mainly just because I like toys.

891
00:46:12,014 --> 00:46:13,875
Our first toy that was announced, actually,

892
00:46:13,875 --> 00:46:17,716
I've always loved ants, you know, ever since SimAnt and before,

893
00:46:17,716 --> 00:46:20,778
and I got a chance to go meet with people that make the ant farm, Uncle Milton's,

894
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:22,839
and told them, hey guys, I like your ant farm, but I could do better.

895
00:46:22,839 --> 00:46:25,580
And so we asked if we could redesign the ant farm, and we did.

896
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:27,080
So we redesigned the ant farm for them,

897
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:29,501
and it's going to be on the market this fall.

898
00:46:29,501 --> 00:46:31,262
It's called the Ant Farm Revolution.

899
00:46:32,102 --> 00:46:36,443
You know, it's fun kind of taking in, even with that, we're kind of looking at how we,

900
00:46:36,443 --> 00:46:39,223
you know, not only have an ant farm, but have a collectible card game about ants and all

901
00:46:39,223 --> 00:46:40,624
the cool ant species and stuff like that.

902
00:46:40,624 --> 00:46:44,304
So I'm, you know, with a lot of things in the Stupid Fun Club, trying to move gaming

903
00:46:44,304 --> 00:46:48,245
out into the wider world, embedding it in television and toys, you know, in the web

904
00:46:48,245 --> 00:46:49,186
and stuff like that.

905
00:46:49,186 --> 00:46:51,826
We're also working on some game projects that I can't really talk about.

906
00:46:51,826 --> 00:46:52,106
That's cool.

907
00:46:52,106 --> 00:46:52,846
But for the most part.

908
00:46:52,846 --> 00:46:57,047
And for the gaming stuff, you know, we are doing some gaming stuff, and, but for the

909
00:46:57,047 --> 00:47:01,328
most part, the stuff we're working on is not shrink-wrapped, triple-A, Xbox only.

910
00:47:01,970 --> 00:47:05,493
It's stuff that's a little bit more diffuse, you know, mobile, web, connected.

911
00:47:05,493 --> 00:47:10,237
And I'm really interested right now in games that get people more engaged in the world

912
00:47:10,237 --> 00:47:12,839
around them rather than distracted from it.

913
00:47:12,839 --> 00:47:15,721
So games that actually are kind of played out in the world and about real things.

914
00:47:15,721 --> 00:47:18,844
And using the world as a gaming platform rather than an Xbox.

915
00:47:18,844 --> 00:47:19,865
Wow. So kind of AR stuff.

916
00:47:19,865 --> 00:47:20,845
Cool. I'll talk to you later.

917
00:47:20,845 --> 00:47:23,588
What's the biggest thing keeping you up at night right now?

918
00:47:23,588 --> 00:47:26,930
And what are you trying to figure out next for the industry?

919
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:29,332
You may have talked about that. I'll shut up after that.

920
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,902
The biggest thing keeping me up at night right now is a 27-pound 10-month-old.

921
00:47:32,902 --> 00:47:36,465
I have a new son, Parker, who's wonderful, but that's what keeps me up at night.

922
00:47:36,465 --> 00:47:37,125
Congratulations.

923
00:47:37,125 --> 00:47:37,305
Thank you.

924
00:47:37,305 --> 00:47:37,846
Thank you.

925
00:47:37,846 --> 00:47:37,886
Hi.

926
00:47:37,886 --> 00:47:37,926
Hi.

927
00:47:37,926 --> 00:47:38,146
Hey, yeah.

928
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:49,874
Yeah, I just wondered if you could share your thoughts on the N1 rocket platform and any

929
00:47:49,874 --> 00:47:55,277
of the issues there that may have kept them from successfully being able to get to the

930
00:47:55,277 --> 00:47:55,538
moon.

931
00:47:55,538 --> 00:47:55,938
Oh, the N1.

932
00:47:55,938 --> 00:47:56,118
Yeah.

933
00:47:56,118 --> 00:47:56,678
Yeah.

934
00:47:56,678 --> 00:47:56,798
Yeah.

935
00:47:57,348 --> 00:47:58,369
That's a long story.

936
00:47:58,369 --> 00:48:00,971
That's a whole other Russian Space Minute.

937
00:48:00,971 --> 00:48:02,552
The N1 was an amazing booster,

938
00:48:02,552 --> 00:48:04,674
and they had amazing engineers on it,

939
00:48:04,674 --> 00:48:06,035
but they didn't have the budget.

940
00:48:06,035 --> 00:48:07,657
The entire Russian space program,

941
00:48:07,657 --> 00:48:09,158
you know, even up to that point,

942
00:48:09,158 --> 00:48:11,520
up to, like, the lunar race,

943
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,642
the Russians were basically operating

944
00:48:13,642 --> 00:48:15,803
on about 20% of the resources of NASA.

945
00:48:15,803 --> 00:48:18,125
The Saturn V did a huge number of ground tests

946
00:48:18,125 --> 00:48:19,387
of the Saturn V booster,

947
00:48:19,387 --> 00:48:20,868
and they had some huge problems

948
00:48:20,868 --> 00:48:22,169
with the internal dynamics of that,

949
00:48:22,169 --> 00:48:22,849
called pogoing,

950
00:48:22,849 --> 00:48:24,771
where these oscillations would start being set up

951
00:48:24,771 --> 00:48:26,032
and the thing would shake itself apart.

952
00:48:26,551 --> 00:48:28,473
And it was only because of their extensive ground testing

953
00:48:28,473 --> 00:48:30,454
that they were able to kind of solve that problem.

954
00:48:30,454 --> 00:48:32,996
You know, basically, had NASA had the budget the Russians did,

955
00:48:32,996 --> 00:48:34,718
there's no way the Saturn V would have ever,

956
00:48:34,718 --> 00:48:35,719
you know, become flight ready.

957
00:48:35,719 --> 00:48:37,881
So the Russians were forced to do flight tests

958
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:39,222
when instead they should have been doing ground tests.

959
00:48:39,222 --> 00:48:40,883
And they were all full-scale tests

960
00:48:40,883 --> 00:48:42,485
of every stage at the same time.

961
00:48:42,485 --> 00:48:44,446
And that was the only way they possibly even had a shot at it.

962
00:48:44,446 --> 00:48:45,467
And they kind of knew that.

963
00:48:45,467 --> 00:48:46,988
They kind of knew that it was a long shot.

964
00:48:46,988 --> 00:48:48,690
They had about a one-in-three chance or maybe a one-in,

965
00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:50,912
you know, six chance of pulling it off.

966
00:48:50,912 --> 00:48:53,174
And the N1 was this humongous thing.

967
00:48:53,174 --> 00:48:54,315
It was bigger than the Saturn V.

968
00:48:55,367 --> 00:48:59,129
had a huge number of engines in the bottom of it.

969
00:48:59,129 --> 00:49:02,771
And also the material science in Russia was a little bit beyond NASA,

970
00:49:02,771 --> 00:49:05,832
and they kept having failures down in the turbine section of the engine,

971
00:49:05,832 --> 00:49:09,934
and typically most of the failures were the result of a turbine burst

972
00:49:09,934 --> 00:49:13,636
that would then cascade through the entire first stage.

973
00:49:13,636 --> 00:49:14,936
But that's the short story.

974
00:49:14,936 --> 00:49:16,797
Awesome, thank you.

975
00:49:16,797 --> 00:49:17,777
Sure.

976
00:49:17,777 --> 00:49:19,098
Yeah?

977
00:49:19,098 --> 00:49:22,780
Hey, I was at your IGDA interview with the Romero Archives.

978
00:49:23,167 --> 00:49:28,889
Yeah. And you talked about that robot kind of game that you were contemplating while you were developing SimCity kind of in parallel.

979
00:49:28,889 --> 00:49:31,109
Oh right, yeah. In fact, I kind of skipped over that here.

980
00:49:31,109 --> 00:49:37,872
But there was a game I worked on actually between Red Emberling Bay and SimCity that I called ProBot.

981
00:49:37,872 --> 00:49:42,653
And it was a very strange game. It was like, I was moving over a scrolling world still,

982
00:49:42,653 --> 00:49:46,715
but it was like this Escher-like world of platforms and catwalks and ramps.

983
00:49:46,715 --> 00:49:49,116
And in that world, you actually were driving this little robot.

984
00:49:49,116 --> 00:49:51,977
And basically, it was a little six-wheel robot with an arm on top.

985
00:49:52,553 --> 00:49:54,514
And if you move the joystick around, you would drive the robot.

986
00:49:54,514 --> 00:49:57,715
If you held the button down to move the joystick, you would move the arm.

987
00:49:57,715 --> 00:50:00,096
And so you could kind of move around, up and down these little platforms,

988
00:50:00,096 --> 00:50:01,456
and pick up things and manipulate them.

989
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:05,657
And then on top of that, I built this kind of weird landscape of waterfalls,

990
00:50:05,657 --> 00:50:06,818
some going uphill, some going downhill.

991
00:50:06,818 --> 00:50:09,799
Again, you know, downhill, a very Escher-like world

992
00:50:09,799 --> 00:50:13,660
that little things were flowing on the water,

993
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:15,740
little balls and boxes and pyramids and stuff.

994
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:19,421
And you were trying to collect these, you know, with opponents.

995
00:50:19,421 --> 00:50:21,702
It's kind of hard to describe, but...

996
00:50:21,702 --> 00:50:21,842
Yes.

997
00:50:22,367 --> 00:50:27,590
So my question was, in that talk and in now, there's sort of this series of facts and it's

998
00:50:27,590 --> 00:50:31,032
this interesting hindsight model. I was wondering if you could talk about, you know, in the

999
00:50:31,032 --> 00:50:34,914
moment, like a lot of these people here, you're, you know, you don't know that SimCity is a

1000
00:50:34,914 --> 00:50:38,876
really great idea and that's going to succeed. Were there like emotions and sort of decision

1001
00:50:38,876 --> 00:50:43,078
making you had to do to, like hard decisions to go with SimCity? How did that feel in the

1002
00:50:43,078 --> 00:50:43,418
moment?

1003
00:50:43,418 --> 00:50:47,641
That's a good point. So I was working on this little robot game and kind of at the same

1004
00:50:47,641 --> 00:50:50,462
time I started playing around with the editor and playing around with SimCity.

1005
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:54,733
It wasn't SimCity at that time, it was a world editor and I was putting down little roads.

1006
00:50:54,733 --> 00:50:58,115
But I began becoming interested in adding more dynamics to the world.

1007
00:50:58,115 --> 00:51:00,556
I wanted to see traffic moving on the roads and things happening.

1008
00:51:00,556 --> 00:51:04,359
And so that was the first time I actually started reading books on, you know, cities

1009
00:51:04,359 --> 00:51:08,081
and urban planning and urban dynamics and came across the work of Jay Forrester who

1010
00:51:08,081 --> 00:51:10,943
wrote a seminal work way back called Urban Dynamics.

1011
00:51:10,943 --> 00:51:18,247
And because I had that kind of resource, this depth of a whole field of topic to research,

1012
00:51:18,247 --> 00:51:19,148
I got interested.

1013
00:51:19,462 --> 00:51:20,682
more interested in this little program.

1014
00:51:20,682 --> 00:51:22,523
Hey, I wonder if I can do a traffic model

1015
00:51:22,523 --> 00:51:23,864
the way they do traffic models.

1016
00:51:23,864 --> 00:51:24,985
I wonder if I can do land value

1017
00:51:24,985 --> 00:51:26,766
according to this theory.

1018
00:51:26,766 --> 00:51:27,947
And in some sense,

1019
00:51:27,947 --> 00:51:29,608
the research I was uncovering

1020
00:51:29,608 --> 00:51:31,149
that eventually led me to SimCity

1021
00:51:31,149 --> 00:51:33,370
was encouraging me to spend more and more time

1022
00:51:33,370 --> 00:51:34,250
working on that simulator.

1023
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:36,192
Whereas the robot game was really just this

1024
00:51:36,192 --> 00:51:36,992
fantasy little world.

1025
00:51:36,992 --> 00:51:38,313
It wasn't really connected to anything.

1026
00:51:38,313 --> 00:51:39,674
It was purely from my imagination,

1027
00:51:39,674 --> 00:51:41,195
which was cool in and of itself.

1028
00:51:41,195 --> 00:51:43,316
But I think there was something deeply fulfilling

1029
00:51:43,316 --> 00:51:45,457
about me trying to recreate the world

1030
00:51:45,457 --> 00:51:46,558
in what became SimCity.

1031
00:51:47,037 --> 00:51:49,297
relative to imagining just a fantasy world in the robot game.

1032
00:51:49,297 --> 00:51:51,758
And I think that's kind of what really tipped the balance.

1033
00:51:51,758 --> 00:51:53,438
That I found myself more and more...

1034
00:51:53,438 --> 00:51:56,939
I never really thought of city planning as that fascinating

1035
00:51:56,939 --> 00:51:57,660
until I had been...

1036
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:00,921
At some point, popped up and realized I was developing a city simulator

1037
00:52:00,921 --> 00:52:01,921
for several months.

1038
00:52:01,921 --> 00:52:02,681
And I kind of looked back and said,

1039
00:52:02,681 --> 00:52:04,902
wow, this is like a little city simulator, isn't it?

1040
00:52:04,902 --> 00:52:07,823
And that was the point at which I started noticing urban books,

1041
00:52:07,823 --> 00:52:08,883
urban planning books, and saying,

1042
00:52:08,883 --> 00:52:09,823
wow, that looks like a good book.

1043
00:52:09,823 --> 00:52:11,384
Whereas before, I would have walked by and said,

1044
00:52:11,384 --> 00:52:12,744
wow, that sounds boring.

1045
00:52:12,744 --> 00:52:14,925
And it was this almost discovery, the fact that...

1046
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:19,200
by having this little guinea pig city on my computer I could poke and prod

1047
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,422
now made the subject matter fascinating to me.

1048
00:52:21,422 --> 00:52:25,204
Whereas before the subject matter, just reading it in text would have been very dry and boring.

1049
00:52:25,204 --> 00:52:29,187
So it was that discovery that I think I wanted the player to kind of re-experience

1050
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:30,749
when they were playing the game.

1051
00:52:30,749 --> 00:52:33,831
So did you say the model was sort of following your own interests and fun

1052
00:52:33,831 --> 00:52:34,952
and just trusting your instincts?

1053
00:52:34,952 --> 00:52:39,515
Yeah. I mean, in that case, you know, typically almost all the games I've worked on,

1054
00:52:39,515 --> 00:52:43,258
every game I've worked on, has been, you know, some passion, some interest I've had.

1055
00:52:43,733 --> 00:52:52,200
that I knew that I could, you know, spend years immersed in this because I love the idea of the subject, the topic, whatever it is, whether it's ants or cities, astronomy or helicopters.

1056
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:57,925
You know, unless you really enjoy, you know, the topic, you're not going to do a good job on it.

1057
00:52:57,925 --> 00:53:02,168
So, and to me, that was one of the huge attractions of becoming a game designer.

1058
00:53:02,168 --> 00:53:06,191
You know, it was when I realized that, that I realized, okay, I don't have to become an architect or an engineer or whatever.

1059
00:53:06,191 --> 00:53:10,835
If I'm a game designer, I can study whatever subject I want to, immerse myself in it, and get paid for it.

1060
00:53:11,142 --> 00:53:15,403
It was one of the few careers I actually saw where I could spend my life learning about

1061
00:53:15,403 --> 00:53:18,905
random disconnected topics and still making go of it.

1062
00:53:18,905 --> 00:53:19,265
Thank you.

1063
00:53:19,265 --> 00:53:20,065
Sure.

1064
00:53:20,065 --> 00:53:21,806
Yeah.

1065
00:53:21,806 --> 00:53:21,966
Yeah.

1066
00:53:21,966 --> 00:53:22,146
Hey, Will.

1067
00:53:22,146 --> 00:53:22,286
Hey.

1068
00:53:22,286 --> 00:53:29,409
So suppose I know this guy whose copy of Bungling Bay happened to be a pirated copy.

1069
00:53:29,409 --> 00:53:34,471
What should I tell him would be your favorite charity to send the inflation adjusted retail

1070
00:53:34,471 --> 00:53:35,591
cost of goods to?

1071
00:53:35,591 --> 00:53:37,472
Oh, wow.

1072
00:53:37,472 --> 00:53:38,112
That's a good one.

1073
00:53:41,363 --> 00:53:50,047
Man, I would say take that money and just use it to support the indie game scene, you know, right now.

1074
00:53:50,047 --> 00:53:59,952
I think that's, you know, the kind of ethos of these games, where they came from, or, you know, what the indie game scene represents right now.

1075
00:53:59,952 --> 00:54:03,353
And so I'd say anything you can do to represent that community, that's where it should flow.

1076
00:54:03,353 --> 00:54:03,854
Great answer, thanks.

1077
00:54:03,854 --> 00:54:04,074
Sure.

1078
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:04,174
Yeah.

1079
00:54:04,174 --> 00:54:08,196
Uh, maybe a better answer would be...

1080
00:54:09,121 --> 00:54:15,546
The Pursuit of Happiness Foundation. We're a non-profit that specializes in getting custom controllers to gamers with disabilities.

1081
00:54:15,546 --> 00:54:15,766
Oh, okay.

1082
00:54:15,766 --> 00:54:16,967
Just throwing it out there.

1083
00:54:16,967 --> 00:54:24,334
Yeah, there are many good gaming charities. There's another one that I was just acquainted with.

1084
00:54:24,334 --> 00:54:27,596
I forgot what it was called, though. I wish I could remember the name.

1085
00:54:27,596 --> 00:54:38,325
But basically it's for disabled veterans in the military hospitals, you know, basically donating games and Xboxes and stuff to these people that are stuck in the hospital, you know, for long periods of time.

1086
00:54:38,766 --> 00:54:48,191
And for them, you know, the big deal is, you know, Halo's coming out. We want Halo. And they actually send people down and buy Halo for full retail price so these soldiers back in the hospitals can, you know, enjoy it.

1087
00:54:48,191 --> 00:54:55,334
And I thought it was just a great charity for these guys that, you know, really aren't asking for much. In fact, they love, you know, this is the demographic. This is our pride demographic.

1088
00:54:55,334 --> 00:55:00,637
And I forgot the name of the charity, though. I wish I could remember it. But there are many good gaming charities out there.

1089
00:55:02,688 --> 00:55:10,854
Yeah. Hi, Will. I was just curious, how long did it take you to make and did you have to have like a secondary job, like to support yourself at the time?

1090
00:55:10,854 --> 00:55:16,457
Um, actually I was going to school at the time I was working on Bungling Bay and it took me about a year.

1091
00:55:16,457 --> 00:55:23,062
But at that time what would typically happen is you'd go to a publisher, you'd kind of build a prototype, which, you know, back in those days would take you a few weeks or a month.

1092
00:55:23,062 --> 00:55:27,164
You know, the first prototype I showed to Broderbund was the result of about a month of coding on my part.

1093
00:55:27,164 --> 00:55:30,827
And the publishers would typically give you an advance on royalties.

1094
00:55:31,298 --> 00:55:35,322
The royalties back then were extravagant, to say the least.

1095
00:55:35,322 --> 00:55:38,245
They were like 20, 25% of what they'd receive.

1096
00:55:38,245 --> 00:55:42,108
And the licensing royalties, the reason I made enough to

1097
00:55:42,108 --> 00:55:47,314
help kickstart Maxis was that of the licensing revenue, they

1098
00:55:47,314 --> 00:55:48,815
would actually give me 40%.

1099
00:55:48,815 --> 00:55:51,878
So 40% of what Nintendo paid Broderbund, I got.

1100
00:55:51,878 --> 00:55:52,899
In 800,000 copies, it kind of added up.

1101
00:55:53,459 --> 00:55:55,861
But that was typically what happened back then.

1102
00:55:55,861 --> 00:55:58,602
And almost nobody spent more than a year on a game.

1103
00:55:58,602 --> 00:56:00,103
A year was a huge, huge amount of time

1104
00:56:00,103 --> 00:56:01,304
to spend on all these games.

1105
00:56:01,304 --> 00:56:03,925
Some of these guys, like Nasser Gabelvi,

1106
00:56:03,925 --> 00:56:05,486
would spend three months just banging it out

1107
00:56:05,486 --> 00:56:06,547
and do the next one.

1108
00:56:06,547 --> 00:56:07,668
Three months, three months.

1109
00:56:07,668 --> 00:56:09,269
And these were good games.

1110
00:56:09,269 --> 00:56:10,149
They weren't junk.

1111
00:56:10,149 --> 00:56:13,411
They were just amazing little pieces of craftsmanship

1112
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:13,931
on the Apple II.

1113
00:56:13,931 --> 00:56:14,832
Cool.

1114
00:56:14,832 --> 00:56:15,272
Thanks.

1115
00:56:15,272 --> 00:56:16,353
Sure.

1116
00:56:16,353 --> 00:56:20,515
Hey, you mentioned earlier that one of the reasons

1117
00:56:20,515 --> 00:56:22,377
you wanted to create Bungling Bay was sort of this.

1118
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:26,832
feeling of having a self-contained world for the player to explore.

1119
00:56:26,832 --> 00:56:27,393
Yeah.

1120
00:56:27,393 --> 00:56:30,835
And I know you study architecture, right?

1121
00:56:30,835 --> 00:56:31,195
Yeah.

1122
00:56:31,195 --> 00:56:34,598
I actually, when I first went to college, my first major was architecture.

1123
00:56:34,598 --> 00:56:35,318
Okay.

1124
00:56:35,318 --> 00:56:40,742
I was wondering if maybe you thought about what it would be like to have a game where

1125
00:56:40,742 --> 00:56:44,425
it was just a world to explore and maybe there weren't any really goals or objectives.

1126
00:56:44,425 --> 00:56:47,147
I've seen art projects like that.

1127
00:56:47,147 --> 00:56:51,970
You know, different people, you know, both coming from the game community and also coming

1128
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:52,130
from.

1129
00:56:53,187 --> 00:56:56,850
the art community, people like Bill Viola and stuff, kind of doing these interactive

1130
00:56:56,850 --> 00:57:02,413
things where you're just kind of moving through a space. In some sense I always thought the

1131
00:57:02,413 --> 00:57:07,016
Miller Brothers stuff, Cosmic Osmo, Manhole, that's what those games felt like to me. And

1132
00:57:07,016 --> 00:57:11,218
you know, those games, even though they were basically elaborate hypercard stacks, and

1133
00:57:11,218 --> 00:57:16,782
Myst as well, were these almost artistic statements of ambience.

1134
00:57:17,250 --> 00:57:22,631
what it felt like to be sitting there and hearing the wind blow through the trees, or the water lap against the shore.

1135
00:57:22,631 --> 00:57:24,651
The puzzles were kind of an excuse.

1136
00:57:24,651 --> 00:57:27,312
And even, you know, Cosmic Cosmo and Manhole didn't even really have puzzles.

1137
00:57:27,312 --> 00:57:29,292
It was just like little toys you could go kind of play with.

1138
00:57:29,292 --> 00:57:32,793
But they had places. It was these spaces, and every space had a different feeling.

1139
00:57:32,793 --> 00:57:36,693
I remember there was one scene in Manhole that I always just found enchanting,

1140
00:57:36,693 --> 00:57:40,794
and it was simply this little open field on a summer night with the crickets chirping.

1141
00:57:40,794 --> 00:57:44,575
And this is black and white graphics, you know, on the Macintosh, but yet...

1142
00:57:45,012 --> 00:57:47,754
going to that screen and moving around this little meadow and hearing the crickets chirping

1143
00:57:47,754 --> 00:57:51,436
on a warm summer night was so evocative to me. And it just amazed me how they can kind

1144
00:57:51,436 --> 00:57:55,639
of pull that association out of my mind using such simple techniques. But, you know, and

1145
00:57:55,639 --> 00:57:58,581
again, in this game there was nothing to do. There was no winning or losing. It was just

1146
00:57:58,581 --> 00:58:02,764
you kind of moving around the world. But I always love their stuff.

1147
00:58:02,764 --> 00:58:03,824
Thanks.

1148
00:58:03,824 --> 00:58:08,267
I don't want to start dueling charities here, but one of the better.

1149
00:58:08,708 --> 00:58:12,190
One of the better kept secrets of the IGDA is the fact that it has a 501c3 foundation,

1150
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:13,030
which is a charity.

1151
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:18,333
There are people in this room who have benefited student scholarships from the IGDA foundation.

1152
00:58:18,333 --> 00:58:21,414
So it's your organization and it's a charity.

1153
00:58:21,414 --> 00:58:22,755
It comes off your taxes.

1154
00:58:22,755 --> 00:58:27,357
So if you're looking for a place for a few spare shekels to help folks in the industry,

1155
00:58:27,357 --> 00:58:29,518
that's one of the ones to check out.

1156
00:58:29,518 --> 00:58:31,099
Okay, thanks.

1157
00:58:31,099 --> 00:58:33,760
So I'm having trouble making rent this month.

1158
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:36,522
Yeah, so what's your charity?

1159
00:58:39,212 --> 00:58:43,753
Actually, I wanted to ask if Chetted and Wetted are still around or if they went up in the fire.

1160
00:58:43,753 --> 00:58:49,975
No, it all went up in the fire. I mean, I had all these old prototypes, my original Commodore, my original Apple II.

1161
00:58:49,975 --> 00:58:52,815
Yeah, it all went up in the fire, unfortunately.

1162
00:58:52,815 --> 00:58:54,796
Well, that sucks. Thank you.

1163
00:58:54,796 --> 00:58:56,056
Yeah, I know. Yeah.

1164
00:58:56,056 --> 00:58:58,517
Did I ever get my own helicopter? No, no.

1165
00:58:58,517 --> 00:59:03,619
But I actually had a pilot's license before I kind of got into all this stuff.

1166
00:59:03,619 --> 00:59:07,580
And later when I was working on SimCopter, I went out and started taking helicopter flight lessons.

1167
00:59:08,175 --> 00:59:10,577
Although I never got my helicopter license.

1168
00:59:10,577 --> 00:59:13,818
But I still to this day just love those things.

1169
00:59:13,818 --> 00:59:15,719
They're just too expensive to own.

1170
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:17,760
They're not very practical machines.

1171
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,741
Let's see, how are we doing on time?

1172
00:59:19,741 --> 00:59:22,342
We probably should, I think, one more question.

1173
00:59:22,342 --> 00:59:22,622
One more?

1174
00:59:22,622 --> 00:59:22,742
OK.

1175
00:59:22,742 --> 00:59:23,243
Yeah.

1176
00:59:23,243 --> 00:59:27,325
Concerning your interest in games

1177
00:59:27,325 --> 00:59:30,566
and conveying interest in topics to other people

1178
00:59:30,566 --> 00:59:34,688
through making a game on that topic, so when is cosmetology,

1179
00:59:34,688 --> 00:59:37,550
or I'm sorry, not cosmetology.

1180
00:59:38,167 --> 00:59:42,749
the Russian, the Soviet space program, when is that going to be the next topic for your

1181
00:59:42,749 --> 00:59:43,710
game?

1182
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:45,431
Oh, the Russian space program.

1183
00:59:45,431 --> 00:59:49,313
In fact, that's, you know, I think the games are great for certain things and I think storytelling

1184
00:59:49,313 --> 00:59:50,333
is great for other things.

1185
00:59:50,333 --> 00:59:54,596
I think of play and story as kind of two sides of the same coin.

1186
00:59:54,596 --> 00:59:59,958
And the Russian thing I think definitely is more a story thing.

1187
00:59:59,958 --> 01:00:03,320
You know, one of the reasons I kind of insert these in my talks is because they're these

1188
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:04,401
amazing untold stories.

1189
01:00:04,728 --> 01:00:06,268
about reality, what really happened.

1190
01:00:06,268 --> 01:00:08,749
Everybody's heard the Apollo 13 story over and over and over,

1191
01:00:08,749 --> 01:00:10,950
but equally bizarre, interesting, cool things

1192
01:00:10,950 --> 01:00:13,371
have happened in the Russian program many, many times,

1193
01:00:13,371 --> 01:00:14,811
and nobody in the West has ever heard them.

1194
01:00:14,811 --> 01:00:15,952
In fact, a lot of people in Russia,

1195
01:00:15,952 --> 01:00:17,392
most people in Russia have never heard them.

1196
01:00:17,392 --> 01:00:19,473
A lot of these were classified until about, you know,

1197
01:00:19,473 --> 01:00:21,093
15 years ago.

1198
01:00:21,093 --> 01:00:23,994
And so one of my background projects is, in fact,

1199
01:00:23,994 --> 01:00:25,295
trying to find a really dramatic way

1200
01:00:25,295 --> 01:00:27,816
to bring these stories to the public,

1201
01:00:27,816 --> 01:00:30,616
probably in the form of dramatic, you know, reenactments.

1202
01:00:30,616 --> 01:00:32,697
So I'm just practicing for that.

1203
01:00:33,989 --> 01:00:35,215
All right, well, thanks, everybody.
