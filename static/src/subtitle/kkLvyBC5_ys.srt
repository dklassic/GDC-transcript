00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,169
What can meditation teach us about game design?

2
00:00:09,213 --> 00:00:11,414
What can meditation teach us about game design?

3
00:00:11,794 --> 00:00:18,195
Can we design digital games to alter a player's experience of their universe as dramatically as a dose of LSD?

4
00:00:18,915 --> 00:00:28,897
In this talk, I offer that understanding trance is a key to using good old-fashioned game design to alter a player's experience of consciousness itself.

5
00:00:29,617 --> 00:00:34,838
We'll be going over different kinds of trances, what those trances do, and how to induce them.

6
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:39,373
And in order to ground these ideas firmly in a practice of game design,

7
00:00:39,634 --> 00:00:44,157
I'll be relating my own experience designing Soundcell through this frame,

8
00:00:44,197 --> 00:00:46,139
through this lens of trance design.

9
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,443
So, let's start now with just a very short mindfulness meditation.

10
00:00:51,483 --> 00:00:54,845
But we're going to look at this not as a yogi, but as a systems designer.

11
00:00:55,786 --> 00:00:58,608
So, close your eyes. This will just take a minute.

12
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,632
Take a deep, luxurious breath in. Really enjoy it.

13
00:01:07,463 --> 00:01:14,348
Breathe out all the way and focus your attention on the

14
00:01:14,368 --> 00:01:22,794
sensation of breath. You can release yourself of controlling

15
00:01:22,834 --> 00:01:31,000
the breath and just observe. Now your mind will come in and

16
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,122
distract you and take your attention away from breath.

17
00:01:35,965 --> 00:01:39,409
When that happens, just bring your attention back to the

18
00:01:39,449 --> 00:01:46,658
breath. And this is natural, it's natural to get distracted.

19
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:54,146
Just bring your attention back to breath. Now what you're doing

20
00:01:54,186 --> 00:01:56,349
right now is playing a game.

21
00:01:57,701 --> 00:02:01,103
And the rules of this game shape your attention and your experience.

22
00:02:02,324 --> 00:02:05,526
And as soon as you begin following those rules automatically,

23
00:02:06,046 --> 00:02:07,207
you've entered a trance state.

24
00:02:08,808 --> 00:02:11,550
The function of a meditation trance is very specific though.

25
00:02:12,491 --> 00:02:16,733
It's to reveal and to help forgive other more unconscious trances.

26
00:02:18,835 --> 00:02:19,675
You can open your eyes now.

27
00:02:20,876 --> 00:02:25,019
In this talk, we're going to learn to leverage this and many other kinds of trances.

28
00:02:26,148 --> 00:02:33,831
So, even if our goals are just simply to create a more fun game, a more immersive game, and give a player more joy,

29
00:02:34,632 --> 00:02:42,375
these tools of trance, having a deeper understanding of trance, gives us a really powerful tool to helping shape a player's journey.

30
00:02:42,986 --> 00:02:50,713
But I think we can use these tools to create fundamentally different kinds of experiences as well.

31
00:02:50,813 --> 00:02:57,459
Experiences that were totally unreachable to us without this frame of looking at game design as trans design.
