1
00:00:08,725 --> 00:00:13,489
So I've got to admit, I'm actually pretty excited to give this talk.

2
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,772
Matter of fact, I think it's fair to say that I'm inspired,

3
00:00:18,533 --> 00:00:21,055
which is surprising because I don't think

4
00:00:21,095 --> 00:00:22,636
there's ever been a time in my life

5
00:00:22,836 --> 00:00:24,738
where I would have predicted that I'd be excited

6
00:00:25,298 --> 00:00:28,781
to be talking about business in any way, shape or form.

7
00:00:29,721 --> 00:00:30,702
But that's what's happening.

8
00:00:31,483 --> 00:00:36,467
And the inspiration came from a Fair Play Alliance Symposium

9
00:00:37,415 --> 00:00:44,359
in London back in October of 2019. We had a roundtable discussion that went over a bunch

10
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,962
of topics, but towards the end of the discussion, we really went pretty deep on one question,

11
00:00:50,942 --> 00:00:57,126
which is how do we get companies to invest in fair play? And while it was a very compelling

12
00:00:57,186 --> 00:01:00,648
discussion, there was something about it that just bugged me.

13
00:01:01,415 --> 00:01:03,737
It just kind of stuck with me for a while,

14
00:01:03,857 --> 00:01:06,079
and I really couldn't put my finger on it.

15
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,821
So I spent some time thinking about it.

16
00:01:09,802 --> 00:01:12,224
And here's what my thought process went like.

17
00:01:12,244 --> 00:01:15,786
I began to think, well, we're talking about fair play,

18
00:01:15,806 --> 00:01:18,829
and I believe we need to focus on player dynamics

19
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:20,010
for fair play.

20
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:23,572
So that means what we're really talking about

21
00:01:23,773 --> 00:01:26,795
is, for lack of a better word, selling player dynamics.

22
00:01:28,716 --> 00:01:29,677
Why does that sound?

23
00:01:30,412 --> 00:01:31,292
So familiar.

24
00:01:32,632 --> 00:01:33,293
And then it hit me.

25
00:01:35,253 --> 00:01:37,314
Is Player Dynamics the new UX design?

26
00:01:38,135 --> 00:01:40,575
Because I've heard these exact same questions

27
00:01:41,156 --> 00:01:42,676
asked many times before.

28
00:01:42,696 --> 00:01:45,417
Because I've been a UX designer for many years,

29
00:01:45,557 --> 00:01:47,138
and especially in the earlier days,

30
00:01:47,558 --> 00:01:49,119
we were asking the same questions.

31
00:01:49,459 --> 00:01:52,380
And I heard many of the same questions and discussions

32
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:55,021
about these challenges at conferences

33
00:01:55,101 --> 00:01:58,062
and also at Riot Games, where I worked for quite a while.

34
00:01:59,097 --> 00:02:00,359
So follow me on a journey a little bit.

35
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,981
I started at Riot Games in 2011.

36
00:02:03,522 --> 00:02:07,486
And at the time, it was a much smaller company.

37
00:02:07,506 --> 00:02:10,770
The UX team was pretty humble.

38
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:13,052
I believe I was the third UX hire.

39
00:02:13,072 --> 00:02:15,014
We had a total of five UX designers.

40
00:02:15,775 --> 00:02:18,818
And we were trying to get a seat at the table.

41
00:02:19,579 --> 00:02:21,261
And a seat at the table in UX design.

42
00:02:22,727 --> 00:02:25,369
is probably the same as for many other disciplines,

43
00:02:25,429 --> 00:02:26,690
but what we were concerned about is

44
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:28,692
not just being embedded on a team,

45
00:02:28,752 --> 00:02:31,174
but helping drive vision and strategy

46
00:02:31,634 --> 00:02:33,356
and helping the company work towards the future

47
00:02:33,396 --> 00:02:34,617
in a more comprehensive way.

48
00:02:35,557 --> 00:02:37,098
And we learned a lot of lessons

49
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:39,941
in order to make this happen,

50
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:41,702
maybe to earn our seat, if you will.

51
00:02:42,723 --> 00:02:45,965
Now, if we fast forward six, seven years or so

52
00:02:45,985 --> 00:02:47,266
into the end of 2018, a lot has changed.

53
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,731
including the length of my hair, as you can see,

54
00:02:53,811 --> 00:02:55,672
and the logo of the company, now that I think about it.

55
00:02:56,172 --> 00:02:58,773
But at this point, the UX team is much bigger

56
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:03,294
and has much greater presence, not just across the company,

57
00:03:03,314 --> 00:03:05,194
but at different levels of the organization.

58
00:03:06,115 --> 00:03:11,116
And we're once again seeing a discipline that's maturing.

59
00:03:11,839 --> 00:03:18,881
That's trying to get that seat at the table, but is also trying to find its way within the organization.

60
00:03:18,961 --> 00:03:20,782
And this one is called Player Dynamics.

61
00:03:22,043 --> 00:03:24,263
And of course, we move forward into today.

62
00:03:25,804 --> 00:03:31,546
But Player Dynamics has had a presence at Riot for quite a while, though we didn't have the term at the time.

63
00:03:31,986 --> 00:03:38,308
So yeah, not long after I joined Riot, I joined the Player Behavior Team, which was doing Player Dynamics work.

64
00:03:39,148 --> 00:03:39,628
But once again...

65
00:03:40,277 --> 00:03:41,337
We didn't think of it that way.

66
00:03:41,557 --> 00:03:44,479
We just were using what we had at the time.

67
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:48,941
And it's taken quite a while for us to mature this field,

68
00:03:49,581 --> 00:03:51,082
not just at Riot, but in other places.

69
00:03:51,282 --> 00:03:53,523
And it took quite a while for us to even get a name.

70
00:03:55,685 --> 00:03:58,526
But this isn't unexpected, because this

71
00:03:58,606 --> 00:03:59,867
is what happens in many fields.

72
00:04:00,147 --> 00:04:02,488
So let's see what's gone on with UX design over the years.

73
00:04:04,909 --> 00:04:06,590
Some people, when we look back to what

74
00:04:07,341 --> 00:04:13,865
caused or helped UX design as a discipline come about go really far back, further back than I'm

75
00:04:13,885 --> 00:04:19,448
showing here on this timeline. Some have said feng shui was where it started. I don't know

76
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:23,670
about that. I mean, that seems pretty over romanticized to me, but we can look back to

77
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:31,354
particular books from the 1950s and particular companies work in the 1980s, and we can look

78
00:04:31,394 --> 00:04:35,197
at products, but it really isn't until the mid-90s that anyone was using the term.

79
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,820
User experience.

80
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,341
And that was coined by Don Norman at Apple.

81
00:04:40,521 --> 00:04:43,502
He actually coined it in a book of his that

82
00:04:43,542 --> 00:04:45,842
came out at the late 80s, but he got the title

83
00:04:46,022 --> 00:04:47,483
at Apple in the mid 90s.

84
00:04:47,903 --> 00:04:50,523
And by the early 2000s, people are really starting to use it.

85
00:04:50,864 --> 00:04:53,784
We see books with the term user experience in it.

86
00:04:54,324 --> 00:04:55,645
And then eventually, we have a product

87
00:04:55,685 --> 00:04:58,706
that many people point to and say, like that.

88
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,886
That's a great example of what user experience

89
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:02,747
design is all about.

90
00:05:03,707 --> 00:05:04,867
This is over the course of decades.

91
00:05:06,215 --> 00:05:08,275
Player dynamics, though it might seem new,

92
00:05:08,295 --> 00:05:11,176
it's actually been evolving in a very similar way.

93
00:05:11,196 --> 00:05:15,098
Now, I'm not going to go back to all the creation of games

94
00:05:15,138 --> 00:05:16,278
and how they evolved.

95
00:05:16,318 --> 00:05:18,239
We're really looking at the time period

96
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:20,639
where we had computer networks and people

97
00:05:20,659 --> 00:05:22,840
were playing at a distance.

98
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,541
And so we can go back to the late 60s, early 70s

99
00:05:26,241 --> 00:05:28,942
and see where this was starting to shape up.

100
00:05:29,282 --> 00:05:30,783
People were figuring out what this meant.

101
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:34,604
Then we can go to the 1980s with games like Habitat.

102
00:05:35,577 --> 00:05:41,459
Which if you don't know about it, that came from LucasArts and it actually was the world's first virtual community.

103
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:47,540
And it's a fascinating read if you find the paper that was written on it from a behavioral perspective and just

104
00:05:48,341 --> 00:05:55,383
for the fact that there were tens of thousands of people who were playing in this world who are also paying by the minute. It's pretty amazing.

105
00:05:56,363 --> 00:05:58,483
Now we fast forward to Ultima Online.

106
00:05:59,582 --> 00:06:02,503
And we're starting to see a lot of terms that we know today

107
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,703
regarding behavior and some solutions.

108
00:06:05,204 --> 00:06:07,545
They learned a lot of lessons that unfortunately we're still learning.

109
00:06:07,565 --> 00:06:12,846
I'm selfishly integrating myself into this timeline because I can.

110
00:06:13,447 --> 00:06:17,888
And in pointing to League of Legends and the player behavior team,

111
00:06:18,188 --> 00:06:20,289
I'd like to think that we've done some pretty good work in this space.

112
00:06:20,329 --> 00:06:23,170
So forgive me for the shameless self-promotion.

113
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:26,511
But even further and even closer to today,

114
00:06:26,631 --> 00:06:27,072
we see it.

115
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,281
The industry is starting to get organized, starting to figure out how can we collectively

116
00:06:32,561 --> 00:06:37,883
focus on fair play. And this in particular is the Fair Play Alliance. And about that time,

117
00:06:37,943 --> 00:06:45,445
we see that the player dynamics term has been coined. Now, there's a lot in common, and there

118
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:51,287
are some pretty big gaps from when we see milestones to when we actually even have

119
00:06:51,827 --> 00:06:54,968
enough organization or understanding of a space to give it a name.

120
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,581
And there are a lot of lessons that user experience designers

121
00:06:59,621 --> 00:07:01,322
have learned that we can leverage.

122
00:07:01,602 --> 00:07:03,503
So maybe it doesn't take us so long

123
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:07,064
to get the seats at the table, to actually help

124
00:07:07,105 --> 00:07:08,425
people invest in this space.

125
00:07:09,285 --> 00:07:12,427
But we do have to keep in mind that these are the early days

126
00:07:12,467 --> 00:07:13,307
for player dynamics.

127
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:15,808
And there's a lot that we still don't know

128
00:07:15,828 --> 00:07:18,009
that we really don't know.

129
00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:21,050
But by leveraging these lessons, I

130
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,851
think it'll be much easier for all of us

131
00:07:23,211 --> 00:07:23,471
to help.

132
00:07:24,384 --> 00:07:26,926
For lack of a better word, sell player dynamics.

133
00:07:28,107 --> 00:07:29,929
And what I would like to do for the remainder of the talk

134
00:07:30,489 --> 00:07:31,770
is walk you through some of these lessons

135
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:33,351
that we've seen in UX design

136
00:07:34,012 --> 00:07:36,514
and that we've been using at Riot in player dynamics

137
00:07:36,974 --> 00:07:38,796
to help the company grow

138
00:07:38,856 --> 00:07:40,497
and to help grow our own understanding

139
00:07:41,097 --> 00:07:42,899
and to affect the kind of change

140
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:44,240
that we feel that we need to see

141
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,861
within our company in the industry.

142
00:07:47,142 --> 00:07:49,844
And there are five strategies that we're gonna dive into.

143
00:07:50,725 --> 00:07:52,587
The first is champion by doing.

144
00:07:55,494 --> 00:07:59,257
Now, some may prefer the term evangelize by doing.

145
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:02,399
It's up to you which term makes the most sense.

146
00:08:02,619 --> 00:08:05,160
I like a champion by doing rolls off the tongue.

147
00:08:06,421 --> 00:08:07,962
And we're going to go through a few ways

148
00:08:07,982 --> 00:08:09,643
that I've seen this to really be effective.

149
00:08:09,903 --> 00:08:11,985
This is what we've used with UX and what we've

150
00:08:12,065 --> 00:08:13,025
used for player dynamics.

151
00:08:13,986 --> 00:08:17,748
So the first is you've got to find a way to do the work.

152
00:08:19,024 --> 00:08:20,124
It's just that simple.

153
00:08:20,885 --> 00:08:22,425
You may not always get approval.

154
00:08:22,885 --> 00:08:24,765
You may not always get buy-in.

155
00:08:24,865 --> 00:08:25,726
And that's fine.

156
00:08:25,846 --> 00:08:27,146
Find a way to do the work.

157
00:08:28,126 --> 00:08:31,847
And the best place to start is by seeking achievable problems.

158
00:08:33,467 --> 00:08:34,308
Look for quick wins.

159
00:08:34,688 --> 00:08:35,688
It's totally fine.

160
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:38,388
What you're trying to do at this stage is build confidence

161
00:08:38,428 --> 00:08:39,049
and build momentum.

162
00:08:40,189 --> 00:08:42,289
And the people you're going to be building confidence with

163
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:43,670
are partners.

164
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:49,179
You're going to want to find partners, and you're going to need to be a good partner.

165
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,121
Because everyone that you work with has something that they're accountable for.

166
00:08:53,561 --> 00:08:57,602
And though you're trying to effect a change, it means other people may have to change.

167
00:08:58,502 --> 00:09:02,323
And you need to be patient, recognize what they're accountable for, and work together

168
00:09:02,343 --> 00:09:05,184
to achieve those goals, figure out how you can help each other.

169
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:09,226
And be careful as you go not to do a few particular things.

170
00:09:10,526 --> 00:09:12,427
Don't push philosophy.

171
00:09:13,537 --> 00:09:14,297
It's not going to work.

172
00:09:15,257 --> 00:09:18,859
It's just going to sound rude, or people's eyes will glaze over.

173
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:20,459
I'm learning this the hard way.

174
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,860
And I get excited about the philosophical part,

175
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,381
so trust me, don't push too hard on it,

176
00:09:25,441 --> 00:09:26,362
though it might be helpful.

177
00:09:27,802 --> 00:09:29,743
Don't insult people with education.

178
00:09:30,944 --> 00:09:32,924
Slapping them upside the head with research

179
00:09:33,064 --> 00:09:37,206
to try and prove how they just are ignorant in some way,

180
00:09:37,266 --> 00:09:37,986
it's not going to help.

181
00:09:38,106 --> 00:09:39,807
You want to put this knowledge to use.

182
00:09:40,227 --> 00:09:41,708
Just don't beat people up with it.

183
00:09:43,603 --> 00:09:45,983
And with that in mind, don't focus on wrongs.

184
00:09:46,923 --> 00:09:47,904
If you're going to be a good partner,

185
00:09:48,584 --> 00:09:51,264
if you're going to help, don't focus

186
00:09:51,444 --> 00:09:54,745
on where people may have arguably screwed up.

187
00:09:55,425 --> 00:09:58,005
What you want to do is solve the problem, not the blame.

188
00:09:58,525 --> 00:10:01,646
So be patient and try not to get too worked up

189
00:10:01,686 --> 00:10:03,406
when things aren't quite going the way you want,

190
00:10:03,486 --> 00:10:05,407
because what you're doing is trying to effect change.

191
00:10:05,727 --> 00:10:07,827
Change can be slow and sometimes painful.

192
00:10:10,508 --> 00:10:11,348
So with that in mind.

193
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,401
You will find yourself in a position

194
00:10:14,421 --> 00:10:16,681
where you're gonna want to fine tune your strategy,

195
00:10:16,801 --> 00:10:20,222
maybe find specific tactics that will work for your company.

196
00:10:20,702 --> 00:10:22,243
And the question you need to start with is,

197
00:10:23,483 --> 00:10:24,143
how mature is it?

198
00:10:24,983 --> 00:10:28,004
How mature is my company in the player dynamics space?

199
00:10:29,084 --> 00:10:30,144
And there are different levels.

200
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:31,945
And what I would like to introduce now

201
00:10:32,825 --> 00:10:34,365
is something that we've been using at Riot Games.

202
00:10:34,445 --> 00:10:36,506
It's been very helpful for us to understand

203
00:10:36,566 --> 00:10:38,806
where we're at and where we may need to go.

204
00:10:40,287 --> 00:10:42,267
So this is the player dynamics maturity model.

205
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,044
There are six levels, one to six.

206
00:10:46,984 --> 00:10:48,705
Arguably, the first could be zero.

207
00:10:49,025 --> 00:10:51,026
I'd be fine with that if you want to revise it.

208
00:10:51,767 --> 00:10:55,028
But what we're looking at is a way for us

209
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:56,489
to evaluate where we're at.

210
00:10:56,509 --> 00:10:59,450
And there are signs that you can see in these companies

211
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,391
that align to particular tactics

212
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:02,431
that I've seen to be effective.

213
00:11:03,152 --> 00:11:05,193
So the first level is skeptical.

214
00:11:06,192 --> 00:11:07,213
That one's pretty easy to tell.

215
00:11:07,853 --> 00:11:09,894
If your company's not doing anything

216
00:11:09,954 --> 00:11:11,715
and just doesn't think that this is a thing,

217
00:11:12,576 --> 00:11:15,077
then you're probably in a space that's fairly skeptical.

218
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:21,140
Ceremonial is where a company agrees that this is important

219
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:23,302
but isn't really investing anything in it.

220
00:11:23,342 --> 00:11:24,662
They don't see that they should.

221
00:11:25,263 --> 00:11:27,424
Or it could be that you're at a company that has a franchise

222
00:11:28,004 --> 00:11:30,586
where there are pretty fixed expectations

223
00:11:30,746 --> 00:11:32,347
for what the next game is gonna be

224
00:11:32,447 --> 00:11:34,528
and change could be a scary proposition.

225
00:11:35,794 --> 00:11:38,417
Provincial is where Riot has been for the longest time,

226
00:11:39,318 --> 00:11:43,683
where we had a single team on a single game.

227
00:11:44,364 --> 00:11:46,347
That was originally the player behavior team.

228
00:11:47,488 --> 00:11:50,271
And this basically puts the burden

229
00:11:50,311 --> 00:11:54,296
on one team to be thinking about all of your player dynamics

230
00:11:54,316 --> 00:11:54,656
concerns.

231
00:11:55,758 --> 00:11:56,138
Essential.

232
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:02,776
is a level that happens when your company begins to shift its perspective from reactive to proactive

233
00:12:03,457 --> 00:12:09,665
and begins to look at player dynamics as something that every game team needs to be concerned about.

234
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:13,770
So now we're seeing multiple teams across the company.

235
00:12:14,772 --> 00:12:15,172
Cultural.

236
00:12:16,084 --> 00:12:21,365
is where very few game companies are, where they have committed themselves wholeheartedly to it.

237
00:12:21,405 --> 00:12:27,447
Maybe they were founded on focusing on the space. And societal is where a company has moved outward.

238
00:12:28,307 --> 00:12:32,488
Now they're at a point where they're starting to create external programs, maybe in schools,

239
00:12:32,948 --> 00:12:37,529
high schools, college, etc., where they want to teach some things to the community that they

240
00:12:37,569 --> 00:12:41,810
found viable that apply, of course, to player dynamics. Now,

241
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:47,192
If you've had a moment, and hopefully I didn't go too quick for you to get a sense of where

242
00:12:47,212 --> 00:12:51,153
your company's at, you may want to know what are some strategies that are helpful.

243
00:12:51,633 --> 00:12:54,634
And here are some that I've seen work pretty good.

244
00:12:55,674 --> 00:13:00,856
The first, and this is for the skeptical companies, is fly under the radar.

245
00:13:01,476 --> 00:13:06,298
You may not get investment at first, and what you're going to want to do is go undercover.

246
00:13:07,018 --> 00:13:11,039
Find a way to do that work, as I described, come back with some results.

247
00:13:12,947 --> 00:13:14,987
A champion by doing, essentially.

248
00:13:17,248 --> 00:13:20,349
If your company is ceremonial, what I believe is most helpful

249
00:13:20,409 --> 00:13:22,530
is look at what the company is already doing

250
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:25,351
that others in the space are doing and show the likenesses.

251
00:13:26,191 --> 00:13:27,411
The work may be accidental.

252
00:13:27,491 --> 00:13:28,252
That's fine.

253
00:13:28,412 --> 00:13:30,212
It just may be something to build on.

254
00:13:30,794 --> 00:13:33,635
You may also look to other games, like games or someone

255
00:13:34,175 --> 00:13:36,196
or company in the industry, and say, well, here's

256
00:13:36,256 --> 00:13:37,736
something that they're doing that

257
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:40,857
proves that because there are results that hopefully you

258
00:13:40,877 --> 00:13:42,718
can point to that that's safe.

259
00:13:42,898 --> 00:13:44,118
That's safe for us to try.

260
00:13:44,498 --> 00:13:46,879
And you can build some good momentum with this approach.

261
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:52,381
Provincial, your best bet there is to get really good

262
00:13:53,161 --> 00:13:54,001
at interventions.

263
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:56,542
To make sure that everyone understands what I mean,

264
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,923
interventions are those systems that

265
00:13:59,043 --> 00:13:59,223
help.

266
00:14:00,183 --> 00:14:05,525
Either proactively deal with common forms of disruption or reactively.

267
00:14:05,785 --> 00:14:08,807
Reactively tends to be things like penalties and reports.

268
00:14:08,967 --> 00:14:12,088
Proactive tends to be those things that, let's say like name check,

269
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:15,250
which prevents some inappropriateness from getting into the system.

270
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:18,731
You're going to want to get really good at that and that will take you a long way.

271
00:14:19,952 --> 00:14:23,273
And once you hit that threshold where it's not enough.

272
00:14:24,099 --> 00:14:25,820
You're going to want to develop a shared framework.

273
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:26,981
So essential again,

274
00:14:27,581 --> 00:14:29,623
is where there are multiple teams around the company

275
00:14:29,863 --> 00:14:31,504
and you want everybody thinking the same way

276
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:36,167
and working in a similar framework so that they can align

277
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:38,649
but also make independent decisions across the org.

278
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:42,892
And for the last two levels, I don't know.

279
00:14:43,452 --> 00:14:45,353
I don't know any company that's actually made it

280
00:14:45,413 --> 00:14:47,195
to these levels yet, at least in my opinion,

281
00:14:47,535 --> 00:14:52,158
but I hope many of us do.

282
00:14:53,197 --> 00:14:54,637
And I'm happy to race everyone to the top.

283
00:14:56,858 --> 00:15:00,339
Now, let's say you've got a good sense of the maturity

284
00:15:00,379 --> 00:15:02,400
level of your company, and you know how you're generally

285
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:02,960
going to operate.

286
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,261
What you really need to be thinking about now

287
00:15:06,561 --> 00:15:10,983
is a process that you can use, some way

288
00:15:11,523 --> 00:15:14,264
to show how you're going to go about doing the work.

289
00:15:15,024 --> 00:15:16,445
And what I would like to introduce now

290
00:15:16,705 --> 00:15:19,546
is a framework and a process that Riot has been using.

291
00:15:20,512 --> 00:15:23,593
with increasing success over the last year or two.

292
00:15:24,413 --> 00:15:27,794
And at the core of it is the ECE framework.

293
00:15:28,514 --> 00:15:32,436
And ECE helps us answer the question,

294
00:15:32,576 --> 00:15:34,756
how do we shape behavior at scale?

295
00:15:36,337 --> 00:15:40,558
Stands for Environment, Consequences, and Encouragement.

296
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:42,599
And another way to think of these

297
00:15:42,739 --> 00:15:44,880
is you need to set the right conditions.

298
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,361
You need to provide the right feedback, ideally

299
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:50,042
in a timely fashion.

300
00:15:50,788 --> 00:15:53,889
And help to identify and encourage

301
00:15:54,089 --> 00:15:55,049
the right kinds of behavior.

302
00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:00,291
Now with this at the core, we need a really simple process

303
00:16:00,311 --> 00:16:01,171
that everybody can use.

304
00:16:02,391 --> 00:16:03,852
And this is the one that we have adopted.

305
00:16:04,992 --> 00:16:07,813
And it's just five steps.

306
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:09,573
Hopefully it'll be pretty self-explanatory.

307
00:16:09,754 --> 00:16:12,014
But I'm just going to jump in so we

308
00:16:12,034 --> 00:16:13,875
can see a little bit of what each of these mean.

309
00:16:14,895 --> 00:16:16,936
And we're going to look at some examples of where

310
00:16:16,956 --> 00:16:19,736
we've been using these over the last so many months.

311
00:16:22,092 --> 00:16:24,515
The first step is to identify core values,

312
00:16:25,156 --> 00:16:30,083
and that's about what your game values end you as a company,

313
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:33,026
because it all comes back to the values.

314
00:16:33,818 --> 00:16:35,479
People need to understand where you're coming from,

315
00:16:35,499 --> 00:16:36,680
where the game is coming from.

316
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,280
This is where expectations start.

317
00:16:38,861 --> 00:16:42,483
And you need to learn to be consistent in your values

318
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:43,343
and how you express it.

319
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:46,245
So start with identifying what your values are,

320
00:16:47,065 --> 00:16:50,787
list them, distill them down to the simplest form possible,

321
00:16:51,568 --> 00:16:53,949
and then begin to think about how you're going to align

322
00:16:54,029 --> 00:16:54,930
everything towards them.

323
00:16:57,271 --> 00:16:58,332
With your values in mind,

324
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:01,473
you're ready to define disruption.

325
00:17:02,795 --> 00:17:06,375
Now, a common question in player dynamics conversations

326
00:17:06,915 --> 00:17:09,036
is how do you define disruption?

327
00:17:09,076 --> 00:17:10,576
Everybody has a different meaning for it.

328
00:17:10,636 --> 00:17:12,956
Well, not really.

329
00:17:13,377 --> 00:17:16,797
One easy way to get what would be disruptive to your game

330
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:17,817
is this formula.

331
00:17:18,657 --> 00:17:20,138
Ask yourself three questions.

332
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:22,238
What is the intended experience?

333
00:17:23,598 --> 00:17:25,779
What are players expecting, right?

334
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:27,039
Particularly from the genre

335
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:28,819
or if you have an existing player base.

336
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:31,540
And what is disruptive to both of these?

337
00:17:32,156 --> 00:17:35,477
This will get you really far in understanding what would be disruptive.

338
00:17:36,077 --> 00:17:37,918
Also keeping in mind your own values.

339
00:17:38,018 --> 00:17:39,999
What have you stated to the community?

340
00:17:40,139 --> 00:17:41,360
Like, what are you about, right?

341
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:47,862
And what you see here is the list that we used when we were putting together the definition

342
00:17:47,882 --> 00:17:55,485
or excuse me, the list of disruptive behaviors we believed would, well, let me rephrase it.

343
00:17:55,965 --> 00:17:58,906
These are the things that we believe would be disruptive to Valorant,

344
00:17:59,266 --> 00:18:01,187
which is one of Riot's newer titles.

345
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:05,669
And this was pretty comprehensive and it told us,

346
00:18:05,969 --> 00:18:09,090
okay, great, we know this is disruptive.

347
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,731
Now we know also what to put into our reporting categories

348
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:13,792
so that players would be able to say,

349
00:18:13,832 --> 00:18:16,433
yes, these are the things that we have seen

350
00:18:16,933 --> 00:18:19,374
and these are the things that we believe are also disruptive.

351
00:18:19,634 --> 00:18:21,435
It wasn't telling us necessarily they agreed,

352
00:18:21,555 --> 00:18:23,856
but we knew based on many other conversations

353
00:18:23,896 --> 00:18:26,097
and a lot of research that this was directionally

354
00:18:26,117 --> 00:18:27,157
where everyone was aligned.

355
00:18:29,968 --> 00:18:32,850
The third step is to codify behavior expectations.

356
00:18:33,811 --> 00:18:35,972
And the examples that you see here are from Valorant.

357
00:18:37,113 --> 00:18:42,337
The left is what you see as a player within the game.

358
00:18:43,158 --> 00:18:47,421
And it's the top of the pile, if you will.

359
00:18:47,481 --> 00:18:51,864
Basically, this is about the four things

360
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:54,666
that you're definitely agreeing to.

361
00:18:54,747 --> 00:18:56,628
But it was, of course, a limited space.

362
00:18:56,808 --> 00:18:57,989
So the full-length version.

363
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:07,042
is on their website. And there we list not only the expectations that we have for you in a pro-social

364
00:19:07,082 --> 00:19:12,143
way, but also we get into the details about what will happen if you're exhibiting undesirable

365
00:19:12,183 --> 00:19:17,925
behaviors. And this stage is really just about setting expectations so that we all understand

366
00:19:17,985 --> 00:19:23,326
what we're getting into. But if you're going to affect change, you're going to need to get

367
00:19:23,726 --> 00:19:27,167
targeted. You're going to need to target specific behaviors and that's the fourth step.

368
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,581
And at this point, you're starting to bring a lot of your thinking together.

369
00:19:31,582 --> 00:19:33,523
You're using the ECE framework,

370
00:19:33,543 --> 00:19:37,004
because you want features that align to each of those.

371
00:19:37,024 --> 00:19:41,066
You're going to look at the desirable behaviors and the undesirable behaviors.

372
00:19:41,667 --> 00:19:46,089
And my recommendation is just using a big table to do both of these.

373
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:49,510
And you use the behavioral expectations you've set,

374
00:19:50,251 --> 00:19:53,492
like in the community, excuse me, the community code that we saw from Valorant.

375
00:19:54,697 --> 00:19:56,218
This is actually a version of what we did,

376
00:19:56,698 --> 00:19:57,539
where we mapped out,

377
00:19:57,939 --> 00:20:00,220
here are the categories of disruptive behaviors.

378
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,281
These are the specific things that we've seen.

379
00:20:02,822 --> 00:20:05,683
And here are all the things that we believe we should build

380
00:20:06,183 --> 00:20:08,085
that will target those behaviors.

381
00:20:08,785 --> 00:20:13,748
And we can use this to create an understanding of priority.

382
00:20:13,768 --> 00:20:16,609
So we're gonna map, prior, excuse me,

383
00:20:16,909 --> 00:20:19,931
prioritize and then develop these features.

384
00:20:20,731 --> 00:20:22,753
And naturally, we're gonna wanna measure them.

385
00:20:23,684 --> 00:20:25,184
And that's step five.

386
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:28,785
We need to measure and we need to adapt,

387
00:20:29,545 --> 00:20:32,326
because we won't know going out the gate how something is going

388
00:20:32,406 --> 00:20:34,787
to or how successful, I should say,

389
00:20:34,807 --> 00:20:37,507
a feature is going to be for a particular audience.

390
00:20:38,847 --> 00:20:42,348
Now, these are some metrics that you may want to start with.

391
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:48,049
But we're going to now get into the fourth strategy, where

392
00:20:48,109 --> 00:20:49,830
we can have a framework that should help us get

393
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:52,070
a better understanding of how we need to measure.

394
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,840
And the strategy is to arm yourself with data

395
00:20:57,961 --> 00:20:58,841
because you need to know.

396
00:20:59,922 --> 00:21:01,282
You need to know whether you're doing any good.

397
00:21:02,122 --> 00:21:04,683
And you need to know how you're going to measure success

398
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:07,424
and identify those areas where you may need more work.

399
00:21:08,485 --> 00:21:09,985
So I'd like to introduce another framework

400
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:13,386
that we've been using at Riot that we call GAMES.

401
00:21:14,827 --> 00:21:18,128
Good time, attitude, mastery,

402
00:21:18,988 --> 00:21:20,809
engagement, and social health.

403
00:21:21,774 --> 00:21:24,936
These are the dimensions that we believe we need to look at,

404
00:21:25,256 --> 00:21:26,337
as far as player dynamics,

405
00:21:26,477 --> 00:21:27,998
in order to look at things holistically,

406
00:21:28,259 --> 00:21:31,341
to make good decisions as companies and as product owners.

407
00:21:32,381 --> 00:21:34,923
Now, engagement is probably the most familiar.

408
00:21:36,344 --> 00:21:38,145
You want to know whether you're losing players,

409
00:21:38,165 --> 00:21:41,547
you're keeping players, all the usual things,

410
00:21:41,888 --> 00:21:43,509
but good times helps us get a sense of,

411
00:21:43,629 --> 00:21:44,850
are they really enjoying themselves?

412
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,491
What's the quality of the experience?

413
00:21:47,471 --> 00:21:48,612
Attitude is about trying.

414
00:21:49,254 --> 00:21:55,377
Right? And are they making an effort, especially when it comes to changing the behavior that we've communicated to them,

415
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:59,919
they may need to correct a little bit on. Mastery, are they getting better at the game?

416
00:22:00,099 --> 00:22:04,061
Are they growing? Are they learning more about it, which can make it easier when they're playing with others?

417
00:22:04,702 --> 00:22:08,744
And social health is the community. It's all at a community level.

418
00:22:09,744 --> 00:22:13,486
Now, if you want to use this, you can use a template.

419
00:22:15,047 --> 00:22:17,248
The template does not come with stock metrics.

420
00:22:17,348 --> 00:22:20,671
The point of this approach is for you to make sure

421
00:22:20,691 --> 00:22:22,152
you're not forgetting the dimensions

422
00:22:22,192 --> 00:22:23,193
that you need to be considering,

423
00:22:24,314 --> 00:22:27,757
and to choose goals for that particular feature

424
00:22:27,877 --> 00:22:30,139
that aligns to that factor, that dimension,

425
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,481
identify the signals you're gonna look for,

426
00:22:32,741 --> 00:22:34,142
and then you can end up with your metrics.

427
00:22:35,043 --> 00:22:36,684
And here's an example of that in practice.

428
00:22:37,705 --> 00:22:39,266
This is something I put together

429
00:22:39,306 --> 00:22:41,148
that represents the chat restrictions feature

430
00:22:41,228 --> 00:22:42,029
in League of Legends.

431
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,150
Here are some goals.

432
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:46,374
Some signals and some metrics.

433
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:50,057
Now, you may see similar metrics for a number of these.

434
00:22:50,397 --> 00:22:50,918
That's fine.

435
00:22:51,598 --> 00:22:53,179
And in practice, you may find sometimes

436
00:22:53,219 --> 00:22:55,200
that you don't have goals for a particular area

437
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:58,763
where you don't think it's, you might feel it's stretching

438
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:02,666
a bit to put in those, to create some goals for, let's say,

439
00:23:03,026 --> 00:23:05,447
mastery for reports, for instance.

440
00:23:05,848 --> 00:23:06,248
That's fine.

441
00:23:07,129 --> 00:23:07,529
That's fine.

442
00:23:07,609 --> 00:23:08,970
This is just to help us understand

443
00:23:10,031 --> 00:23:11,592
that there are multiple dimensions

444
00:23:12,712 --> 00:23:14,073
and that we shouldn't forget them.

445
00:23:15,094 --> 00:23:16,915
Because there's a lot that we need to understand

446
00:23:16,935 --> 00:23:17,895
to affect behavior change.

447
00:23:19,676 --> 00:23:19,936
All right.

448
00:23:21,197 --> 00:23:24,979
There's one more strategy I want to show you a little bit about,

449
00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:26,780
and that's prepare for misconceptions.

450
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,541
If you're a UX designer, or if you know any,

451
00:23:30,901 --> 00:23:33,943
then you probably have heard quite a few stories

452
00:23:33,983 --> 00:23:35,544
about the misconceptions in UX.

453
00:23:36,144 --> 00:23:37,925
I won't go through all of those now.

454
00:23:38,345 --> 00:23:40,286
I'll be happy to talk with you at some point about them

455
00:23:40,446 --> 00:23:41,346
for fun, if you like.

456
00:23:42,027 --> 00:23:44,188
But we're already seeing some misconceptions in player

457
00:23:44,228 --> 00:23:44,648
dynamics.

458
00:23:45,337 --> 00:23:52,022
So let's take a look at a few and a few ways that I've responded to them, sometimes just for fun.

459
00:23:52,763 --> 00:23:59,568
The first, maybe the most classic, is well that's just the internet. We can't help it.

460
00:23:59,628 --> 00:24:05,813
That's what people on the internet do. But there's a problem. We have a responsibility.

461
00:24:06,951 --> 00:24:08,332
We didn't make the whole internet.

462
00:24:08,352 --> 00:24:10,333
We're not concerned about the whole internet

463
00:24:10,373 --> 00:24:13,535
because no one company or team can control it.

464
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:16,656
What we're concerned about is our part of the internet.

465
00:24:17,297 --> 00:24:18,177
So think about it this way.

466
00:24:19,398 --> 00:24:23,980
People in our games wouldn't be having the bad experiences

467
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,621
that they may be having in our games

468
00:24:25,981 --> 00:24:28,923
if we didn't put them in our games, right, to begin with.

469
00:24:29,663 --> 00:24:31,144
And so that part of the world is ours.

470
00:24:31,584 --> 00:24:33,906
And furthermore, players are asking us

471
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:35,266
to do more in this space.

472
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:43,116
The next, and I think this is a pretty fair question overall,

473
00:24:43,176 --> 00:24:45,537
is shouldn't a game designer just be doing this work?

474
00:24:47,558 --> 00:24:47,978
Of course.

475
00:24:48,918 --> 00:24:49,718
Of course they should.

476
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:52,499
I would say the same about UX design.

477
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:55,060
We should all be concerned about the user experience.

478
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,120
The thing is.

479
00:24:57,538 --> 00:24:59,900
You do a lot of stuff, making it really hard

480
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,041
to focus on everything.

481
00:25:01,581 --> 00:25:03,522
If you're needing to focus on a particular part

482
00:25:03,562 --> 00:25:05,784
of an experience, it's hard to think about the whole thing,

483
00:25:05,844 --> 00:25:07,846
which is why we have UX designers,

484
00:25:08,246 --> 00:25:10,187
so that they can keep that holistic perspective.

485
00:25:10,628 --> 00:25:12,329
And what we've seen through player dynamics

486
00:25:12,509 --> 00:25:13,910
is it grows the same way.

487
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:15,652
Eventually you're gonna need to specialize

488
00:25:15,672 --> 00:25:17,773
so you can focus where you need to

489
00:25:17,813 --> 00:25:20,315
and make sure you're not losing the perspectives, right,

490
00:25:20,695 --> 00:25:23,417
that help bring out the most in your games.

491
00:25:24,818 --> 00:25:27,080
And the final, oh, and this hurts.

492
00:25:27,806 --> 00:25:32,729
Oh god, it hurts. I heard this recently and decided to add it in at the last minute,

493
00:25:32,829 --> 00:25:41,194
but the misconception is this is all too fluffy. Oh, it burns. Because we'll talk about concepts

494
00:25:41,214 --> 00:25:45,236
like cohesion and how important it is, and people will come back with things like,

495
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:51,840
it's too fluffy. Decades of science begs to differ. We are not making this stuff up.

496
00:25:52,561 --> 00:25:55,002
We're just trying to figure out how best we can apply it to games.

497
00:25:55,823 --> 00:25:56,943
But all right, let's bring it on home.

498
00:25:59,245 --> 00:26:01,326
For those of us that are working in fair play

499
00:26:01,366 --> 00:26:04,047
and in player dynamics, we want to increase investment.

500
00:26:04,707 --> 00:26:07,649
And there are five strategies that we've been using

501
00:26:07,909 --> 00:26:08,990
that I've seen to be effective,

502
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:11,171
that we saw effective in UX design,

503
00:26:11,211 --> 00:26:12,872
and hopefully will save you a lot of time and effort.

504
00:26:13,792 --> 00:26:16,053
Champion by doing, just get in a way,

505
00:26:16,633 --> 00:26:18,274
just get in there, find a way to do the work.

506
00:26:19,535 --> 00:26:21,796
Gauge the maturity level of your company,

507
00:26:21,836 --> 00:26:23,437
which means figure out the right strategy

508
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:26,358
for where they're at to help them move up that ladder.

509
00:26:26,378 --> 00:26:28,920
Find a process, work it.

510
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:34,152
Hone it with others so that you can have a reliable way to organize towards these goals

511
00:26:34,212 --> 00:26:39,154
and understand what you're doing. Get that data so you know if you're affecting change.

512
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:42,976
We've proposed a framework for both this and the process that we hope will help,

513
00:26:44,177 --> 00:26:49,259
and prepare for the misconceptions because they're going to happen. That comes with the territory,

514
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:54,181
