00:00:06,127 --> 00:00:07,988
My talk today is called Empathizing with Steam,

2
00:00:08,188 --> 00:00:09,209
How Buyers See Your Game.

3
00:00:12,912 --> 00:00:15,674
So about a year ago, I released my first game on Steam.

4
00:00:16,315 --> 00:00:17,936
And when you're going through the process

5
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:19,217
and you're filling out all the forms,

6
00:00:19,558 --> 00:00:21,459
you get this store page form.

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,061
And it's just this giant blank box

8
00:00:24,081 --> 00:00:25,983
that you have to fill out that describes,

9
00:00:26,543 --> 00:00:28,505
it just prompts you to say about this game.

10
00:00:28,565 --> 00:00:31,067
And I had no idea what to put in this box.

11
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:32,588
So I made up something.

12
00:00:32,628 --> 00:00:34,770
I just threw words at it, basically.

13
00:00:35,612 --> 00:00:38,797
And my game released, and it didn't sell very well.

14
00:00:39,177 --> 00:00:41,781
It was very positive, I got a lot of good reviews,

15
00:00:42,081 --> 00:00:43,082
but it just didn't sell.

16
00:00:43,623 --> 00:00:45,946
And I just wondered, what the hell

17
00:00:46,006 --> 00:00:47,668
are Steam shoppers actually looking for?

18
00:00:48,229 --> 00:00:50,272
And so I took this really, really extreme.

19
00:00:51,206 --> 00:00:57,091
basically step to do, which is I just started watching people buy games on Steam. I found

20
00:00:57,111 --> 00:01:00,835
people online who are willing to let me do a one-on-one screen share through Discord,

21
00:01:01,455 --> 00:01:06,320
and I just gave them the simple prompt, go shop for stuff on Steam. I just want to see what you do.

22
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:13,906
And what I did was I did this for 15 hours. Not straight, I did this across several different

23
00:01:14,027 --> 00:01:18,010
Steam shoppers, and I really got a good sense of what they're looking for.

24
00:01:19,053 --> 00:01:20,673
And so what I'm going to show you in this talk

25
00:01:21,093 --> 00:01:22,714
is what I learned in those 15 hours.

26
00:01:22,754 --> 00:01:25,954
I'm going to show you how to get good screenshots, good videos.

27
00:01:26,374 --> 00:01:28,715
I'm going to show you that I found some really strange

28
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:31,835
behavior that players are incredibly genre-focused.

29
00:01:32,095 --> 00:01:34,216
And they really know what they like and what they don't like.

30
00:01:34,736 --> 00:01:36,516
And then I'm going to show you some tricks that I learned

31
00:01:36,556 --> 00:01:39,457
during Steam sales and how to make your game more attractive.

32
00:01:40,197 --> 00:01:42,257
And then the other thing that I did was I found out

33
00:01:42,297 --> 00:01:44,558
that their friends really play a big.

34
00:01:45,003 --> 00:01:47,964
big, big role in what games they pick and which ones they don't.

35
00:01:48,104 --> 00:01:52,605
And so I'm going to show you how to kind of maximize that and really get good word of mouth

36
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:55,786
based on your Steam page and just in general marketing.

37
00:01:57,046 --> 00:01:58,767
Okay, so there's going to be five parts to this talk.

38
00:01:59,267 --> 00:02:01,887
I'm going to talk about the methodology that I use and why I did it.

39
00:02:01,947 --> 00:02:04,548
I'm going to show you how to make your Steam page that sells.

40
00:02:04,568 --> 00:02:07,489
And I'm going to show you the steps that a typical user is going to go through when

41
00:02:07,509 --> 00:02:08,429
they're looking at Steam.

42
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:13,050
I'm going to show you how to know your genre and why that's so important,

43
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,770
how incredibly important it is.

44
00:02:15,264 --> 00:02:16,805
And then fourth, I'm going to show you

45
00:02:16,825 --> 00:02:18,026
how to manage a Steam sale.

46
00:02:18,046 --> 00:02:18,966
It can be a little crazy.

47
00:02:19,427 --> 00:02:20,908
And then fifth, I'm going to show you

48
00:02:20,928 --> 00:02:23,209
how to turn those wish listers into actual buyers,

49
00:02:23,229 --> 00:02:25,231
because you can get stuck in the cart and not get out.

50
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:26,732
So I'm going to show you all of this today.

51
00:02:27,873 --> 00:02:29,254
So let's start with the methodology.

52
00:02:29,894 --> 00:02:33,397
I'm an indie game designer, but I'm also a marketing consultant.

53
00:02:33,457 --> 00:02:35,398
So in addition to making games, I also

54
00:02:35,438 --> 00:02:37,640
help other companies sell their own games

55
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,802
and make their marketing just as tight as can be.

56
00:02:40,082 --> 00:02:42,744
So I have a real interest in this and a lot of history

57
00:02:42,764 --> 00:02:43,745
with helping.

58
00:02:44,181 --> 00:02:46,322
people make better games and marketing them better.

59
00:02:47,603 --> 00:02:49,904
My first game was One Screen Platformer on Steam.

60
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:52,645
And before I got into games

61
00:02:52,685 --> 00:02:54,446
and before I started becoming a marketing consultant,

62
00:02:54,766 --> 00:02:55,807
I was a UX designer.

63
00:02:56,127 --> 00:02:57,908
And this is actually a picture that I took.

64
00:02:58,268 --> 00:02:59,208
It's at an airport.

65
00:02:59,368 --> 00:03:00,549
I used to work for an airline.

66
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,090
And what I would do is I would go and watch

67
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,751
how people actually use the products that I worked on.

68
00:03:06,071 --> 00:03:09,093
Because as a designer, we were trained over and over again,

69
00:03:09,253 --> 00:03:10,233
do not start designing

70
00:03:10,494 --> 00:03:12,495
until you understand what the user does.

71
00:03:13,015 --> 00:03:16,802
And so here I am watching some folks get boarded on a flight to Chicago,

72
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:22,813
and this same approach is what I applied to Steam and understanding how the Steam users shop on Steam.

73
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:33,784
And the reason that's so important and why UX designers learn that is because the users of your software or Steam are not like us as designers.

74
00:03:34,164 --> 00:03:42,348
Being a designer or game developer is a very specific field, and we have different notions of what is good and what's bad than the average consumer.

75
00:03:42,768 --> 00:03:50,071
And so it's really important that you actually step in and empathize with your users by watching how they actually use things.

76
00:03:51,677 --> 00:03:55,119
And so instead of the airline being my client, Steam is my client.

77
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,702
So I treated it the same way I would when I was working in industry.

78
00:03:59,903 --> 00:04:04,066
And so what I did was I recruited users and I set up a one-on-one screen share for about

79
00:04:04,086 --> 00:04:07,289
a half an hour per user and I just gave them a very simple prompt.

80
00:04:07,689 --> 00:04:11,752
I said, what do you do when you start Steam? And then I just let them go.

81
00:04:12,608 --> 00:04:15,790
And the way that we do it in UX is you try and shut up.

82
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:18,012
You do not want to influence the user too much.

83
00:04:18,172 --> 00:04:19,393
So we do something called talk aloud.

84
00:04:19,413 --> 00:04:21,254
And basically I give them a simple prompt that says,

85
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:22,956
just say everything that you're thinking.

86
00:04:23,336 --> 00:04:24,917
And that really makes sure that people,

87
00:04:25,217 --> 00:04:27,499
when they click on something, I know why they clicked on it.

88
00:04:27,619 --> 00:04:28,920
Or when they stop, the hover.

89
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,321
I know why they're hovering.

90
00:04:30,681 --> 00:04:31,782
And one of the participants said,

91
00:04:32,142 --> 00:04:33,723
you mean like a let's play of Steam?

92
00:04:33,843 --> 00:04:35,645
And I was like, that's exactly it.

93
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:37,946
It was so hard in UX to get people to talk aloud,

94
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,907
but gamers understand this concept

95
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:41,649
of narrating everything that they do.

96
00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:43,610
So it really wasn't very hard to get people talking.

97
00:04:44,971 --> 00:04:47,953
And over the course of the study, I used 15 participants.

98
00:04:48,893 --> 00:04:52,636
The color coding just shows the different phases

99
00:04:52,696 --> 00:04:53,877
of the tests that I used.

100
00:04:54,237 --> 00:04:56,178
So I'm gonna keep them anonymous

101
00:04:56,218 --> 00:04:57,699
because that's part of our agreement.

102
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:58,200
I didn't wanna.

103
00:04:58,773 --> 00:05:02,257
bring everybody public about who they were.

104
00:05:02,617 --> 00:05:05,901
So I just color code them and name them with a letter.

105
00:05:06,702 --> 00:05:08,644
I actually did three phases to this test.

106
00:05:09,032 --> 00:05:14,615
So there's a phase during a normal steam day, just no sales or anything, then during a Halloween

107
00:05:14,675 --> 00:05:18,657
sale, which was a seasonal sale, and then phase three was something called a diary study,

108
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:22,760
and it lasted for three whole months. So I'll show you all of these. Again, the colors just

109
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:28,743
kind of indicate the people that I used in every study. So for example, participant A was used in

110
00:05:28,883 --> 00:05:33,426
all three of them, and that's why color-coded as orange, because I originally met that participant

111
00:05:33,846 --> 00:05:36,308
in phase one, and then they just carried through to the other ones. So it just,

112
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:38,289
the colors indicate which phase they're in.

113
00:05:40,233 --> 00:05:41,954
I also recruited worldwide.

114
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:46,297
I really tried to get a good broad swath of the population.

115
00:05:46,617 --> 00:05:48,979
I got every continent except for Africa and Australia.

116
00:05:49,299 --> 00:05:51,321
Unfortunately, Africa doesn't use Steam very much.

117
00:05:51,381 --> 00:05:52,782
I really tried to find some folks,

118
00:05:52,802 --> 00:05:54,163
but it's really hard to find them.

119
00:05:55,824 --> 00:05:58,526
And then this kind of matches a demographic

120
00:05:58,626 --> 00:06:01,788
how Steam is made up anyways, just by the percentages.

121
00:06:03,089 --> 00:06:05,771
I also over-represented female gamers.

122
00:06:06,997 --> 00:06:10,419
This was to really get a broad swath of use cases.

123
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,001
There's some estimates that it's about 18 to 5%

124
00:06:14,202 --> 00:06:17,183
of Steam's audience is female, but I got it up to almost 50%.

125
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:21,506
I had six identified females in my participant.

126
00:06:22,533 --> 00:06:28,375
list. Also did 18 and over. That's because I made everybody sign a disclosure form so that just to

127
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:33,477
have an agreement that it's okay for me to share this data with all of you and for me to record

128
00:06:33,517 --> 00:06:38,419
them. So I wanted to make sure there was 18 plus, so there's no reason I didn't want to have to

129
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:44,902
recruit parents to get their kid to sign this form or anything. So and most of my audience

130
00:06:44,962 --> 00:06:46,943
anyway for indie games is over 18 anyway.

131
00:06:47,937 --> 00:06:50,757
I also made sure that all the participants had over 50 games.

132
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:53,078
And that's because I'm an indie game developer,

133
00:06:53,558 --> 00:06:56,139
and the people who buy indie games buy a lot of games.

134
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:58,840
That's just because most players who only play

135
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:02,261
maybe a Skyrim or a CSGO just don't have that many games.

136
00:07:02,481 --> 00:07:05,142
So I really wanted to target an indie buying crowd.

137
00:07:06,805 --> 00:07:09,747
And you're probably wondering like, 15 people, that's it? What

138
00:07:09,767 --> 00:07:13,508
about sample size? And so I know that's that's a very critical

139
00:07:13,548 --> 00:07:16,309
thing for quantitative research, which is the opposite of

140
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:19,330
qualitative research, which is what I did. With quantitative

141
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:22,932
research, you're really trying to identify the giant data sets

142
00:07:22,972 --> 00:07:23,452
and prove...

143
00:07:24,392 --> 00:07:28,476
perfect correlation using Spearman's Row and all these giant numbers.

144
00:07:29,156 --> 00:07:30,938
Qualitative research is the other side.

145
00:07:31,278 --> 00:07:34,081
And what you're trying to do is a breadth of experiences.

146
00:07:34,441 --> 00:07:38,024
So, for example, here's a very famous industrial designer named Pat Moore.

147
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:41,207
And what she did was she was trying to study how the elderly use the world.

148
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:44,349
And so what she did, she dressed herself as an older person,

149
00:07:44,369 --> 00:07:47,612
she bound her hands, wore glasses that made it hard for her to see.

150
00:07:47,872 --> 00:07:51,355
And she just explored the world and figured out where things were difficult

151
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:51,956
for somebody who was

152
00:07:52,554 --> 00:07:54,435
elderly or who would be elderly like that.

153
00:07:54,455 --> 00:07:57,015
And her research, and she was a test case of one,

154
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,076
led to things like the OXO Good Grips.

155
00:07:59,136 --> 00:08:00,976
She helped design the OXO Good Grips,

156
00:08:01,016 --> 00:08:02,377
those kitchen tools that have nice,

157
00:08:02,577 --> 00:08:04,157
giant grips that are easier to

158
00:08:04,277 --> 00:08:06,138
use for people who might have mobility problems.

159
00:08:06,718 --> 00:08:09,899
And again, those just were insanely popular.

160
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:10,919
And it was all because she took

161
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,760
a qualitative approach to design.

162
00:08:13,837 --> 00:08:20,823
Similarly, another industrial designer named Doug Dietz, he designed the CRT, the imaging

163
00:08:20,863 --> 00:08:22,264
machines at hospitals.

164
00:08:22,745 --> 00:08:26,488
And he designed this whole thing, all the engineering was sound, and they put it in

165
00:08:26,508 --> 00:08:27,869
the hospital, it worked perfectly.

166
00:08:27,889 --> 00:08:31,872
And then one day he went off to the hospital just to see how it was used, and it turns

167
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:33,193
out it was in the pediatric ward.

168
00:08:33,694 --> 00:08:35,255
And when he sat outside the pediatric ward

169
00:08:35,275 --> 00:08:37,897
and he saw folks coming in, he noticed

170
00:08:38,257 --> 00:08:40,599
that the parents and the people who

171
00:08:40,619 --> 00:08:42,141
were going to be using it and the children

172
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:45,103
were just not very excited about using this machine.

173
00:08:45,123 --> 00:08:47,945
And it wasn't until he actually went and observed

174
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:50,527
real users using his device that he realized

175
00:08:50,547 --> 00:08:51,909
that it was just impractical.

176
00:08:52,309 --> 00:08:54,691
And so what he did was he redesigned his CRT machine,

177
00:08:54,731 --> 00:08:58,014
his imaging machine, so that it was a lot easier and just more

178
00:08:58,074 --> 00:08:58,454
appealing.

179
00:08:58,854 --> 00:09:02,615
And so even if you can't get a huge, huge sample set,

180
00:09:02,935 --> 00:09:04,255
when you're doing qualitative research,

181
00:09:04,435 --> 00:09:06,236
you're really trying to get a breadth of research.

182
00:09:06,716 --> 00:09:10,797
And Nielsen Norman, who is part of this research group,

183
00:09:11,577 --> 00:09:15,558
they do a lot of UX design and UX research,

184
00:09:15,998 --> 00:09:17,898
and what they say is discovering the unexpected

185
00:09:17,978 --> 00:09:20,239
is part of the reasons you do this type of research.

186
00:09:20,779 --> 00:09:23,060
Basically, you don't know what you do know,

187
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,600
you don't know what you don't know

188
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,400
until you do qualitative research.

189
00:09:27,071 --> 00:09:31,576
And the idea is that you should always pair qualitative with quantitative, because quantitative

190
00:09:31,596 --> 00:09:37,422
can prove definitively a couple single points, but you could be proving the wrong one. And the

191
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:43,289
qualitative research is a great way to kind of look back and see a broad range of ways that you

192
00:09:43,309 --> 00:09:47,433
can do research. And when you're doing qualitative research, the most important thing is something

193
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:48,455
called saturation.

194
00:09:49,241 --> 00:09:53,991
And saturation is basically I'm looking not to confirm the same thing multiple times.

195
00:09:54,391 --> 00:09:58,599
What I'm trying to do is find all the edge cases and all the possible paths that people take.

196
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:02,702
So for example, there's kind of a good rule of thumb.

197
00:10:02,762 --> 00:10:04,703
After about six or seven interviews,

198
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:07,745
you start to notice the same things being said over and over again.

199
00:10:08,085 --> 00:10:09,686
And that's the saturation taking place.

200
00:10:09,726 --> 00:10:10,947
And I definitely saw that.

201
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,348
And so what I'm trying to do is,

202
00:10:12,588 --> 00:10:14,869
and that's why I overrepresented women in the study,

203
00:10:14,889 --> 00:10:19,051
is I was trying to find all the different aspects that could implement,

204
00:10:19,091 --> 00:10:21,733
that could be the use cases that people have on STEAM.

205
00:10:22,933 --> 00:10:27,516
So qualitative, again, is a good way to do a springboard for quantitative research.

206
00:10:27,805 --> 00:10:33,188
And I really hope that people who watch this video or read my talk later will actually

207
00:10:33,248 --> 00:10:37,751
take this as an inspiration to go do more quantitative studies based on what I've initially

208
00:10:37,811 --> 00:10:38,192
found here.

209
00:10:39,252 --> 00:10:42,074
So the important thing about qualitative research

210
00:10:42,135 --> 00:10:44,496
is you're not going to hear me make judgments

211
00:10:44,556 --> 00:10:45,837
about how many things happen.

212
00:10:45,897 --> 00:10:48,299
So for instance, if I saw something happen with seven

213
00:10:48,319 --> 00:10:50,961
of my participants out of 15, I can't say,

214
00:10:51,162 --> 00:10:54,724
oh, this is going to happen 46% of all steam

215
00:10:54,744 --> 00:10:55,305
is going to do this.

216
00:10:55,785 --> 00:10:58,507
I'm not going to make those value judgments of how often it

217
00:10:58,567 --> 00:10:58,848
occurs.

218
00:10:59,148 --> 00:11:00,909
But I can say, I've seen this happen

219
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:02,150
or this is a common workflow.

220
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,432
So that's just a way to understand the way

221
00:11:04,512 --> 00:11:06,173
to interpret qualitative data.

222
00:11:07,413 --> 00:11:09,135
OK, I could go into how I recruited.

223
00:11:09,415 --> 00:11:10,495
I'm not going to do that today.

224
00:11:10,715 --> 00:11:12,216
You can read more about that on my website.

225
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:14,378
I did a whole article just on how I did

226
00:11:14,398 --> 00:11:15,538
the methodology for this study.

227
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:18,400
But let's just get into the good stuff here, all right?

228
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,761
So I'm going to show you how to make a Steam page it sells.

229
00:11:21,882 --> 00:11:23,063
There's basically three steps here.

230
00:11:23,363 --> 00:11:25,884
You've got to attract them, tell them what your genre is,

231
00:11:26,124 --> 00:11:27,105
and then build trust with them.

232
00:11:27,325 --> 00:11:28,746
That's what your Steam page is going to do.

233
00:11:28,766 --> 00:11:29,607
And I'll show you how to do that.

234
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,950
Now, I'm going to go rapid fire through this.

235
00:11:32,451 --> 00:11:33,893
This is way too fast to take notes.

236
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:36,858
On my website, I actually put together a special document.

237
00:11:36,938 --> 00:11:39,542
It's just a checklist of things you should do on your Steam page

238
00:11:39,842 --> 00:11:41,124
before you hit the Publish button.

239
00:11:41,525 --> 00:11:43,308
So it's a nice form that you can use.

240
00:11:43,448 --> 00:11:45,010
It's just kind of like a guide.

241
00:11:46,168 --> 00:11:49,231
Okay, so there's eight steps that people go through when they're looking to see whether

242
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:55,298
they should wishlist your game. They browse, hover, click to inspect the page, go to your

243
00:11:55,318 --> 00:12:00,263
Steam page, then they view the game's media, they check tags, they skim the short description, not

244
00:12:00,444 --> 00:12:04,768
do a full read, they totally skip over the long description, and then they check for the negative

245
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:06,931
reviews. And I'm going to show you step by step how that works.

246
00:12:08,386 --> 00:12:10,727
Okay, so the brows, you know, they look at the Steam page,

247
00:12:10,767 --> 00:12:14,568
look around for any icons or any of these capsule images.

248
00:12:14,588 --> 00:12:16,289
And if they find one that's interesting,

249
00:12:16,329 --> 00:12:17,669
they do what I call the hover.

250
00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:19,189
And here's a video that I took,

251
00:12:19,209 --> 00:12:20,370
this is just an animated GIF,

252
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:21,890
of somebody who's doing this hover.

253
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:24,031
And what she's looking for when she does this,

254
00:12:24,331 --> 00:12:26,372
is she's just watching these images cycle.

255
00:12:26,732 --> 00:12:28,612
There's a four image cycle that goes on,

256
00:12:29,053 --> 00:12:31,353
and she's looking to see what the genre of the game,

257
00:12:31,373 --> 00:12:33,394
and if it looks like something that she's gonna want.

258
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:37,142
I want to actually interact with them, maybe possibly buy.

259
00:12:37,483 --> 00:12:39,064
And she's looking at the user tags,

260
00:12:39,204 --> 00:12:41,046
and she's also looking at the number of reviews.

261
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:43,689
And if she likes what she sees in those four images,

262
00:12:43,969 --> 00:12:45,090
she's going to do a click.

263
00:12:46,772 --> 00:12:49,735
Now, that is super important to get that tool tip.

264
00:12:49,795 --> 00:12:51,557
And this was one of the greatest revolutions

265
00:12:51,577 --> 00:12:54,140
that I had when I was doing this research, was that tool tip.

266
00:12:54,664 --> 00:12:59,186
And the thing that's so important is that tooltip only appears when they hover over the image.

267
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:04,069
And so you want your capsule image to be super attractive. I call it a mouse magnet.

268
00:13:04,609 --> 00:13:07,851
For some reason, this capsule is an excellent mouse magnet.

269
00:13:08,211 --> 00:13:11,373
Anytime I was watching participants browse theme and the remnant came up.

270
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:13,571
that mouse went straight to this image.

271
00:13:13,951 --> 00:13:15,852
I don't know what it is about this image.

272
00:13:16,172 --> 00:13:17,252
There's something weird about it.

273
00:13:17,572 --> 00:13:19,573
I don't know if it's something like Cthulhu magic going on,

274
00:13:19,813 --> 00:13:21,254
but everybody hovered on this image.

275
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:23,315
And it's just, it doesn't matter the genre,

276
00:13:23,415 --> 00:13:24,995
even people who didn't like shooters

277
00:13:25,436 --> 00:13:26,296
hovered over this image.

278
00:13:26,376 --> 00:13:28,437
I think it's just the mysteriousness of it,

279
00:13:28,877 --> 00:13:30,818
that just the interesting face that guy's got.

280
00:13:31,138 --> 00:13:33,219
There's just a bunch of things that are interesting.

281
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:35,319
So really test your capsule image

282
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:37,680
to make sure it turns into a mouse magnet.

283
00:13:39,407 --> 00:13:43,049
The other thing is the hover has four images that cycle,

284
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:46,171
so you really have to be cognizant of those four images.

285
00:13:46,991 --> 00:13:51,494
And this is totally, just totally unclear unless you've studied this stuff.

286
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:54,836
This is a picture of the Steamworks UI. This is my game.

287
00:13:55,397 --> 00:13:58,178
The Steam UI does not tell you that the first four images

288
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:00,620
are the most important that are going to show up in this hover.

289
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,481
So you just have to know that.

290
00:14:03,632 --> 00:14:04,652
There's no indicator here.

291
00:14:04,852 --> 00:14:07,753
Just make sure you prioritize the top four images

292
00:14:07,773 --> 00:14:09,854
on Steamworks to be the four that you want

293
00:14:09,874 --> 00:14:11,055
to see in that hover cycle.

294
00:14:11,555 --> 00:14:14,136
And what kind of images should you put in that cycle?

295
00:14:15,217 --> 00:14:17,578
It's got to be really descriptive of your game

296
00:14:17,798 --> 00:14:19,238
and the actions they're going to be taking.

297
00:14:19,678 --> 00:14:21,799
For instance, here's a game that's never going to be on Steam.

298
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:23,040
It's Breath of the Wild.

299
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,381
Now, I picked these four images because I think they're cool.

300
00:14:26,021 --> 00:14:29,142
But I don't think these would be good for your first four

301
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:29,523
images.

302
00:14:29,923 --> 00:14:30,283
Look at them.

303
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:31,703
They're all showing combat.

304
00:14:31,723 --> 00:14:32,984
They're showing you boss battles.

305
00:14:33,709 --> 00:14:36,530
A user who doesn't know what Breath of the Wild is,

306
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,691
and it's just browsing, might interpret this

307
00:14:38,751 --> 00:14:40,431
as some sort of action RPG.

308
00:14:40,811 --> 00:14:42,192
It could be a souls-like.

309
00:14:42,492 --> 00:14:45,633
It could be a action rogue-like.

310
00:14:45,993 --> 00:14:47,613
It's just unclear what you do in this game.

311
00:14:47,633 --> 00:14:49,054
It just looks like you're just doing battling.

312
00:14:49,634 --> 00:14:52,295
A better four-image selection would

313
00:14:52,315 --> 00:14:54,475
be to show the four key elements of the game.

314
00:14:54,836 --> 00:14:56,896
So for instance, for Breath of the Wild,

315
00:14:57,156 --> 00:14:58,957
you do a lot of open-world exploration.

316
00:14:59,337 --> 00:15:00,257
Then in the top right.

317
00:15:01,183 --> 00:15:03,344
There's some crafting and inventory management.

318
00:15:03,724 --> 00:15:05,885
On the bottom right, you do some puzzle solving,

319
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:08,386
and then you do some battles and some boss fights,

320
00:15:08,786 --> 00:15:09,847
but that's just one element.

321
00:15:10,187 --> 00:15:12,088
And so when these four images cycle,

322
00:15:12,168 --> 00:15:14,189
you get a better grasp of what the game is.

323
00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:17,831
So really be cognizant of the four images you pick.

324
00:15:18,131 --> 00:15:19,471
You don't want to repeat yourself,

325
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:22,653
and you want to show a good set of the verbs of the game.

326
00:15:23,754 --> 00:15:25,935
The other thing that people check are the user tags.

327
00:15:26,335 --> 00:15:28,716
Now, the user tags, you only get five on the hover.

328
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:33,533
So you got to make sure those first five are just describing your genre perfectly.

329
00:15:33,953 --> 00:15:38,956
I see a lot of things where it's like indie, that indie tag is worthless. That does not tell people

330
00:15:39,276 --> 00:15:43,558
what the genre is. So you want to make sure that your top five are. The other ones are like,

331
00:15:43,999 --> 00:15:49,502
a female protagonist, that's a noble tag to have, but it doesn't tell the genre. And they can

332
00:15:49,542 --> 00:15:54,325
probably distinguish that, identify that's a female main character from the capsule and

333
00:15:54,385 --> 00:15:56,546
screenshots. So it's worthless as a tag.

334
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:02,381
The other thing that tags do for folks is they identify things that they might not like about the genre.

335
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:06,823
For instance, people who don't like difficult games, if they see Metroidvania as a tag,

336
00:16:07,163 --> 00:16:11,765
that's an identifier for them that this is a difficult game. Even if they don't play

337
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:17,748
Metroidvania, they know from history's sake that Metroidvanias are hard. So they will actually

338
00:16:18,348 --> 00:16:22,130
move away from the game if it's a Metroidvania. Now that's to say, if you do have a Metroidvania,

339
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:24,011
please put that tag in. That's important.

340
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:28,184
You just have to be aware that there's reasons people do not want that game.

341
00:16:30,085 --> 00:16:34,528
So if they like what they see on the hover, they're going to click on the capsule image.

342
00:16:34,889 --> 00:16:37,931
And here at this point, they want your game to be awesome.

343
00:16:38,191 --> 00:16:40,393
If they've clicked, they think your game is neat.

344
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,955
They're on your side. They're looking for things to rule them out of this game.

345
00:16:45,457 --> 00:16:49,680
Okay, and so once they're on your Steam page, they're looking at four big things.

346
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,101
They're looking to the art.

347
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,881
then they look at the tags,

348
00:16:54,301 --> 00:16:55,722
then they look at the short description,

349
00:16:55,962 --> 00:16:57,323
and then they skip all the way down

350
00:16:57,463 --> 00:16:59,544
and they look just at the reviews,

351
00:16:59,764 --> 00:17:01,205
specifically the negative reviews.

352
00:17:01,825 --> 00:17:02,866
Now, when they're looking,

353
00:17:02,886 --> 00:17:04,427
this is an actual animated GIF

354
00:17:04,467 --> 00:17:06,248
of somebody looking at the media.

355
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,269
Now you'll watch, they click real fast

356
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:09,690
and for the screenshots.

357
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,170
They're not watching the trailer first,

358
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:12,651
they're looking at the screenshots.

359
00:17:13,111 --> 00:17:14,672
What they're looking for is gameplay.

360
00:17:14,792 --> 00:17:16,353
They want to see what you are doing,

361
00:17:16,393 --> 00:17:18,014
what the verbs of the game are.

362
00:17:18,532 --> 00:17:20,594
And so they click through them really, really fast.

363
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:22,235
This guy's actually going slow

364
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:23,717
because he's trying to explain what he's doing.

365
00:17:24,497 --> 00:17:26,159
Then they might go to the trailer.

366
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:27,720
And when they're looking at the video,

367
00:17:27,861 --> 00:17:29,362
they're skipping ahead really fast.

368
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:30,884
Watch, he's skipping ahead right there.

369
00:17:31,424 --> 00:17:33,706
Now, I have some friends who make trailers

370
00:17:33,766 --> 00:17:35,308
and they were a little afraid of this.

371
00:17:35,879 --> 00:17:39,761
And the main thing is, I'm not saying to ditch trailers that have any form of

372
00:17:40,582 --> 00:17:45,244
cinematics. I think those should be still made. You just don't want to include them on your Steam

373
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:50,627
page. They're great for YouTube to have rich story elements, but for Steam, they just want to see the

374
00:17:50,767 --> 00:17:55,689
action. They want to see the verbs of the game. So cut out anything that isn't you actually playing

375
00:17:55,709 --> 00:18:01,913
the game. No big intro wind-ups, no slow panning environment shots. They just want to see the action.

376
00:18:03,253 --> 00:18:03,493
Okay.

377
00:18:04,364 --> 00:18:07,447
So this is how not to do a trailer. This is an actual video.

378
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:13,272
Only cinematics. I want to see some goddamn gameplay.

379
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,177
You can hear the frustration in this guy's voice.

380
00:18:19,997 --> 00:18:27,984
Jesus. Let me see gameplay. Oh, that's the gameplay. All right. Where's the UI?

381
00:18:30,787 --> 00:18:32,008
Why do you want to see the UI?

382
00:18:35,487 --> 00:18:37,388
To get no more of the

383
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:41,469
House God I

384
00:18:41,509 --> 00:18:48,211
Mean whenever you see the UI you'll be able to like at least assume some of the portions of the game, right?

385
00:18:50,952 --> 00:18:58,054
Like how how would you be playing it and things like that? This one doesn't tell me anything it's just

386
00:19:00,315 --> 00:19:04,216
He was so frustrated he did a little bit of swearing there I had to beep that out. Sorry folks

387
00:19:05,536 --> 00:19:09,078
And what he's frustrated about is he just wants to see gameplay.

388
00:19:09,478 --> 00:19:12,119
And one of the surprising things is he also wants to see UI.

389
00:19:12,479 --> 00:19:15,401
When I was originally designing pages for Steam, I thought

390
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:17,982
they just want to see a majestic, beautiful screen.

391
00:19:18,002 --> 00:19:19,323
Nobody comes to see menus.

392
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:21,324
They actually do want to see menus.

393
00:19:21,404 --> 00:19:24,145
And the reason is it helps them identify the genre.

394
00:19:24,585 --> 00:19:27,046
If you can see a UI, you can identify the genre.

395
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:28,027
Look at this one right here.

396
00:19:28,607 --> 00:19:31,328
Two bars, some characters and a number of timer in the middle.

397
00:19:31,769 --> 00:19:33,950
Obviously, that's a Street Fighter game, a 2D Street Fighter.

398
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,141
A nice reticle, a gun in the bottom, some health,

399
00:19:38,161 --> 00:19:38,681
some bullets.

400
00:19:39,082 --> 00:19:40,182
That's a first-person shooter.

401
00:19:40,602 --> 00:19:40,903
Easy.

402
00:19:41,743 --> 00:19:44,304
Just two anime characters and a dialogue box.

403
00:19:44,524 --> 00:19:45,705
Obviously, a visual novel.

404
00:19:46,025 --> 00:19:48,406
The UI really tells you the genre.

405
00:19:48,647 --> 00:19:50,548
Better than any description or anything else.

406
00:19:50,868 --> 00:19:53,109
So show UI in your screenshots.

407
00:19:53,309 --> 00:19:54,590
I would have never guessed, but it

408
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:57,531
is so important for players to be able to identify the genre.

409
00:19:59,092 --> 00:20:01,033
After they look at the media, they go over to the tags.

410
00:20:01,073 --> 00:20:01,853
I already talked about that.

411
00:20:01,873 --> 00:20:04,115
A lot of them won't expand the tags to really look for them.

412
00:20:04,545 --> 00:20:08,771
You have the control as a developer to really pick your tags by eliminating them.

413
00:20:08,991 --> 00:20:12,196
Again, remove indie, remove anything that doesn't tell genre.

414
00:20:12,437 --> 00:20:15,541
The most important thing that they're looking for is identifying the genre.

415
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:17,865
Now the short description.

416
00:20:18,105 --> 00:20:19,667
Here's another animated GIF of a

417
00:20:20,528 --> 00:20:22,929
person who's shopping here, they're just skimming it. And

418
00:20:22,949 --> 00:20:25,170
what they're looking for are verbs. They're trying to

419
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:29,051
identify what do you do in the game, not the setting. They

420
00:20:29,071 --> 00:20:31,732
don't care about characters, story. They don't care any

421
00:20:31,752 --> 00:20:35,833
about the fluffy stories. Even people who love games that are

422
00:20:35,893 --> 00:20:39,475
story-based, in fact, this participant does, they don't

423
00:20:39,775 --> 00:20:41,735
care about story at this point. They're just trying to

424
00:20:41,795 --> 00:20:43,636
identify what do you do in the game.

425
00:20:44,134 --> 00:20:47,616
In fact, I heard a lot of people when it was a big story-based short description,

426
00:20:47,636 --> 00:20:51,038
they'd go, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. What do I actually do? They actually said,

427
00:20:51,078 --> 00:20:55,862
blah, blah, blah. They don't want to see a big story or lore dump. Stick to the verbs,

428
00:20:56,102 --> 00:20:57,983
stick to the actions of what you're doing in the game.

429
00:20:59,404 --> 00:21:03,247
Okay, the long description, everybody skipped this thing. So I'm going to skip it too. You

430
00:21:03,267 --> 00:21:08,130
could put a recipe in there for whatever I know. It doesn't matter. Okay, the negative reviews,

431
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,511
they'd always skip down. And it's not that they hate you.

432
00:21:11,285 --> 00:21:14,888
I was really afraid when I started reading negative reviews when they started coming

433
00:21:14,928 --> 00:21:15,568
in for my game.

434
00:21:16,048 --> 00:21:16,789
But it doesn't matter.

435
00:21:17,189 --> 00:21:18,050
Have heart.

436
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:21,152
If it stresses you out to read negative reviews, don't worry.

437
00:21:21,872 --> 00:21:27,495
Because the only thing that players who watch your game are looking for are, are the reasons

438
00:21:27,856 --> 00:21:31,438
this person had a negative response the same reason I don't like games?

439
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:34,100
So if they're a story-based player, and if they...

440
00:21:34,828 --> 00:21:37,650
care about the story, they're going to look for reviews that maybe say,

441
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:40,952
hey, the story is bad, the characters are two-dimensional, the ending sucks.

442
00:21:41,372 --> 00:21:44,954
That's what they care about. But if it's an action-based player, somebody who cares about

443
00:21:44,974 --> 00:21:50,217
FPSs or good action, they are looking more for things like maybe frame rate or how the

444
00:21:50,357 --> 00:21:54,940
character or how the maybe enemies behave, how the AI is. They're really looking forward to

445
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:59,703
see what they match up with. And we all hate these type of negative reviews that just are like one

446
00:21:59,763 --> 00:22:03,505
line, nope. We tweet about them, we complain about them.

447
00:22:03,871 --> 00:22:06,853
Don't worry. Don't waste any emotional energy on them.

448
00:22:07,113 --> 00:22:10,135
The reason is shoppers hate these type of reviews too,

449
00:22:10,175 --> 00:22:12,397
because they don't give them the information that they're looking for.

450
00:22:12,477 --> 00:22:15,759
They're really looking to see why don't you like this game.

451
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:20,282
So if you care about this, don't. Put it outside of your mind.

452
00:22:21,343 --> 00:22:24,525
I came back with a nice warm feeling for negative reviews after studying users.

453
00:22:24,886 --> 00:22:26,066
It doesn't matter that much.

454
00:22:27,327 --> 00:22:30,550
Okay, so after all that, if they like you, they put you on your wish list.

455
00:22:31,937 --> 00:22:34,760
Everything that I just described took 90 seconds.

456
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:37,082
Let me go through and let's actually watch somebody

457
00:22:37,502 --> 00:22:38,963
do this in 90 seconds.

458
00:22:40,465 --> 00:22:41,986
Oh, that looks really cute.

459
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:47,431
Side note, she is in a speed lapse section.

460
00:22:47,591 --> 00:22:48,732
And that's why there's no hover.

461
00:22:48,772 --> 00:22:52,215
So that's why you're seeing a little bit of a video.

462
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:52,916
It's $5.

463
00:22:54,337 --> 00:22:57,340
Lost Robots is a new prequel chapter, blah, blah, blah.

464
00:22:58,897 --> 00:23:01,798
Let's click it. Let's look at it. Did you get a blah blah blah? She said blah blah blah.

465
00:23:02,178 --> 00:23:05,839
So now she's looking at the page. And we'll go through the picture. Oh look how cute that is.

466
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:10,601
Super fast through the images. Super fast, right? What's the tag? Skip the trailer.

467
00:23:10,621 --> 00:23:18,503
Any adventure noir, point and click single player, story rich cash. What's it?

468
00:23:20,544 --> 00:23:25,145
Oh, it's from the Bear With Me people. Oh yeah, Bear With Me, The Lost Rebels. I have

469
00:23:26,545 --> 00:23:27,946
one of the Bear With Me's.

470
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:35,272
This is so cute. When did this come out? July 31st. Let's take a look at the reviews.

471
00:23:35,292 --> 00:23:36,793
Skip the long description. Did you see that?

472
00:23:36,893 --> 00:23:40,416
Curators. Anybody on my curator list? No.

473
00:23:43,659 --> 00:23:47,922
Why don't you like it? I'll always look for the negative ones.

474
00:23:48,022 --> 00:23:54,828
Looking forward to playing this. Lone chapter. So it's very short.

475
00:23:56,863 --> 00:24:02,307
Too short wanted more. Okay. Well, I mean big deal. It's five bucks guys. What do you want?

476
00:24:02,727 --> 00:24:07,631
See she hates negative reviews just as much as we do. It's adorable. It's point and click

477
00:24:08,872 --> 00:24:11,494
It's a known

478
00:24:11,814 --> 00:24:14,436
Uh bear with me series. I know that series

479
00:24:16,598 --> 00:24:17,639
Yeah, that's adorable

480
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,661
Again that took 90 seconds

481
00:24:22,347 --> 00:24:24,990
It's really a fast process that happens.

482
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,031
You've got to make sure your page is dead on,

483
00:24:27,412 --> 00:24:28,593
really easy to navigate.

484
00:24:29,193 --> 00:24:30,434
So let's look at part three.

485
00:24:30,795 --> 00:24:32,076
And I call this know your genre,

486
00:24:32,316 --> 00:24:33,537
because the most important thing

487
00:24:33,637 --> 00:24:35,639
is understanding what genre your game is

488
00:24:35,879 --> 00:24:37,080
and putting it straight up front

489
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,681
so that users know your game's genre.

490
00:24:40,072 --> 00:24:45,034
Okay, a big misconception that new people new to marketing is

491
00:24:45,054 --> 00:24:47,835
that they think that it's like a used car salesman. Like when

492
00:24:47,855 --> 00:24:50,096
you're doing marketing, you're trying to like convert somebody

493
00:24:50,496 --> 00:24:54,238
you actually are not what you're trying to do is find your tribe

494
00:24:54,478 --> 00:24:56,599
find the people who would be predisposed to like your game

495
00:24:56,919 --> 00:25:00,120
and proving to them that you are exactly their type of game.

496
00:25:00,561 --> 00:25:04,224
And then what you're basically doing is this sort of process.

497
00:25:04,264 --> 00:25:07,106
Now, I put these shapes in to represent games that people like,

498
00:25:07,486 --> 00:25:10,309
that maybe a person like, I only like triangle-shaped games,

499
00:25:10,689 --> 00:25:14,032
or pentagon-shaped games. I hate octagon-shaped games.

500
00:25:14,652 --> 00:25:17,555
And then when they look at your Steam page, what they're doing is they're comparing

501
00:25:17,955 --> 00:25:21,658
your game to see if it matches their predisposed interests.

502
00:25:21,959 --> 00:25:23,940
And if it does, great, they're going to buy it.

503
00:25:24,667 --> 00:25:30,148
But if your Steam page is kind of this amorphous dog's breakfast of a conglomeration that's

504
00:25:30,308 --> 00:25:33,930
impossible to identify, it's not like every party is going to do it.

505
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:36,090
They're actually going to compare.

506
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:38,931
They can't determine if it is something they like or if it's not.

507
00:25:39,491 --> 00:25:42,492
And if they can't determine what it is, they're just going to toss it out.

508
00:25:42,972 --> 00:25:45,933
You have to be very absolutely clear what your genre is.

509
00:25:47,374 --> 00:25:48,434
So I'm going to show you.

510
00:25:48,774 --> 00:25:49,334
This is some...

511
00:25:49,895 --> 00:25:54,056
What I did was, anytime they came to a page, I just shut up and just let them speak.

512
00:25:54,666 --> 00:25:58,727
what you're going to see is a video of people looking at a steam page for the first time.

513
00:25:58,747 --> 00:26:02,247
There's no video because I want to just to hear and to read what they say.

514
00:26:03,968 --> 00:26:07,868
It's like Super Meat Boy but with a little bit of 3D or something.

515
00:26:10,389 --> 00:26:17,250
This game is looks very similar to Civilization so I think this is very interesting to me.

516
00:26:18,931 --> 00:26:20,511
Ah looks like FDL.

517
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,581
I actually like these ones.

518
00:26:26,162 --> 00:26:27,583
It looks like Mario Party.

519
00:26:27,704 --> 00:26:28,344
No, thank you.

520
00:26:30,526 --> 00:26:32,247
Reminds me of Alien.

521
00:26:32,707 --> 00:26:33,768
Alien Isolation?

522
00:26:33,788 --> 00:26:34,929
A little bit, not quite.

523
00:26:34,949 --> 00:26:39,393
Yeah, it seems to be some sort of

524
00:26:39,433 --> 00:26:41,454
like city building game, but on a

525
00:26:41,514 --> 00:26:42,355
skyscraper.

526
00:26:44,977 --> 00:26:45,297
Doesn't

527
00:26:45,417 --> 00:26:46,638
interest me specifically.

528
00:26:46,658 --> 00:26:49,460
It feels kind of

529
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,761
night in the woodsy.

530
00:26:51,872 --> 00:26:54,873
And I like that. Oh my god, the art style is so pretty.

531
00:26:55,133 --> 00:27:00,834
A real-time RTS city builder. That's really the kind of combo I love to go for.

532
00:27:03,255 --> 00:27:07,976
Um, I've loved games like The Settlers, Age of Empires.

533
00:27:12,338 --> 00:27:14,678
One of the things that we as indies were always told is,

534
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:19,100
know your hooks, be as unique as possible, stand out, shatter genres, and guess what?

535
00:27:19,912 --> 00:27:22,093
they didn't mention the hooks as the reason they liked the game.

536
00:27:22,493 --> 00:27:27,034
They mentioned the things that were the same. I call them anchors. That's just a term I came up

537
00:27:27,074 --> 00:27:32,176
with. But people are very genre-focused, and they're not excited about what your hook is

538
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:36,597
all the time. The first thing they want to know is, what genre is this? Cut it to me straight.

539
00:27:36,838 --> 00:27:37,618
What genre are you?

540
00:27:38,525 --> 00:27:45,590
And so what I'm trying to say is your store page should be stripping out everything that your game is not and being absolutely clear

541
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:52,354
Focus on appealing to the type of people who like your genre know the genre the top game in your genre

542
00:27:52,374 --> 00:27:54,936
Did you notice that they kept referencing other games?

543
00:27:56,197 --> 00:27:58,638
Like this guy who said it's like an f2l ftl

544
00:27:59,239 --> 00:28:02,401
Flat faster than light. I actually like those type of games

545
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:06,233
He didn't say, like an FTL, clone, get out of here.

546
00:28:06,353 --> 00:28:09,435
No, he was excited that this game was the same as an FTL.

547
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:11,016
So don't think like that.

548
00:28:11,096 --> 00:28:13,858
We really need to start kind of going back

549
00:28:13,898 --> 00:28:15,019
and being sure of our genres.

550
00:28:16,215 --> 00:28:21,316
Okay, I'm going to go quick tangent, and this is to show how important making the genre is.

551
00:28:21,656 --> 00:28:27,317
Now, I'm not making fun of this. I think this is really cool. So indie romance authors are some of

552
00:28:27,337 --> 00:28:32,078
the smartest markers you've ever seen, and I really take a lot of inspiration from them.

553
00:28:32,458 --> 00:28:37,639
So we complain a lot because Steam has 35,000 games, right? It's an apocalypse. Games everywhere,

554
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,340
right? Guess what? Indie romance authors are on Amazon, which has eight

555
00:28:43,009 --> 00:28:47,370
million books. I'm not making that number up. That is literally, it's 8 million books on Amazon.

556
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:53,093
They look at our 35,000, they say, oh, you sweet child. So how the hell did they get their books

557
00:28:53,193 --> 00:28:57,975
sold when there's 8 million books? And some of these indie romance authors make a million dollars

558
00:28:58,015 --> 00:29:05,057
a year. So let me show you. OK, these are indie romance book covers. They all look the same to

559
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:08,919
you, right? There's a very special language going on here. OK.

560
00:29:09,739 --> 00:29:11,440
I'm just gonna walk you through this real fast

561
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,401
and it's gonna be life-changing.

562
00:29:13,821 --> 00:29:15,002
Okay, again, I'm not making fun of this.

563
00:29:15,022 --> 00:29:15,702
I think this is awesome.

564
00:29:16,062 --> 00:29:19,064
Okay, so there's a very sub-genre of romance

565
00:29:19,084 --> 00:29:21,425
called Highland Romance, romancing a Scotsman, I guess.

566
00:29:22,266 --> 00:29:25,587
If you see tartan, a sword, and a castle in the background,

567
00:29:25,787 --> 00:29:27,128
you know you got Highland Romance.

568
00:29:27,728 --> 00:29:29,589
Shifter Romance, which is like werewolves,

569
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:30,890
but why stop at wolves?

570
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:33,311
We got bears, dragons, tigers.

571
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:35,072
If you see an animal behind a hunk,

572
00:29:35,592 --> 00:29:37,373
that is a shifter romance.

573
00:29:37,994 --> 00:29:40,135
There's another subgenre called reverse harem romance.

574
00:29:40,476 --> 00:29:42,737
Instead of multiple girls, it's multiple guys.

575
00:29:43,197 --> 00:29:44,938
You know that it's a reverse harem

576
00:29:44,978 --> 00:29:46,299
if there's a bunch of guys in the back.

577
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:48,060
Love that name, nail and studs.

578
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:52,162
Okay, so, sub, sub, sub romance genres.

579
00:29:52,222 --> 00:29:54,263
They have even more specific tastes.

580
00:29:54,743 --> 00:29:56,985
And now, I'm not gonna tell you what this one is.

581
00:29:57,485 --> 00:29:58,365
You can just identify it

582
00:29:58,385 --> 00:29:59,326
because you've learned the language.

583
00:30:00,046 --> 00:30:00,467
What do we have?

584
00:30:00,487 --> 00:30:03,208
We have a wolf in the front, multiple studs in the back.

585
00:30:03,428 --> 00:30:03,828
What is that?

586
00:30:04,149 --> 00:30:05,749
Shifter, reverse harem.

587
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:07,130
You know the genre.

588
00:30:07,815 --> 00:30:11,818
Okay, this one here, wolf in the back. The guy's wearing a kilt with a nice tartan and

589
00:30:11,838 --> 00:30:16,701
there's a castle in the background. Guess what this is? Shifter Highlander. You know this romance.

590
00:30:17,021 --> 00:30:21,484
You figured it out. You know the language now. Now, I wrote a whole blog post on this and how

591
00:30:21,504 --> 00:30:27,468
to look at genres for romance novels. And this guy on Twitter was like, why even be in the anymore?

592
00:30:28,309 --> 00:30:32,492
And I kind of, I get him. I get it. And those covers are cheesy. I'm not saying we literally

593
00:30:32,532 --> 00:30:34,453
need to do that. Although those would be more fun, wouldn't it?

594
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:37,610
Here's what to learn from romance indie authors.

595
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:38,911
And this is the key point here.

596
00:30:39,911 --> 00:30:41,571
You gotta know your audience's kinks.

597
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:42,912
Learn what they are.

598
00:30:43,392 --> 00:30:47,273
Romance authors have studied the sub, sub, sub genre kinks

599
00:30:47,473 --> 00:30:48,113
of their audience.

600
00:30:48,453 --> 00:30:49,473
You should learn those too.

601
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,514
And then they put those kinks straight up.

602
00:30:51,894 --> 00:30:53,734
They know the language that people are looking for

603
00:30:54,075 --> 00:30:55,315
so that it's crystal clear.

604
00:30:55,755 --> 00:30:57,575
Be absolutely clear with your genre

605
00:30:57,595 --> 00:30:59,416
so your shoppers will not have any questions.

606
00:30:59,536 --> 00:31:01,757
It's so that in an instant, you can identify the genre.

607
00:31:02,727 --> 00:31:04,947
And like when you're coming off of a romance novel

608
00:31:04,967 --> 00:31:06,368
like Bridges of Madison Counter,

609
00:31:06,428 --> 00:31:08,928
you don't come to the book and say, maybe I'm into this.

610
00:31:08,948 --> 00:31:10,369
I think this might be my genre.

611
00:31:10,609 --> 00:31:12,489
You're like, you're either in for the bear or you're not.

612
00:31:12,549 --> 00:31:13,130
Get out of here.

613
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:16,150
Okay, and so I think we should have similar confidence

614
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:16,731
on our pages.

615
00:31:17,011 --> 00:31:18,391
Be very, very clear what you are

616
00:31:18,591 --> 00:31:20,152
and just put it straight up there.

617
00:31:21,292 --> 00:31:23,233
And we've got this actually in games right now.

618
00:31:23,513 --> 00:31:24,474
Look at these simulator games.

619
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:25,954
You know what kind of simulators they are.

620
00:31:25,994 --> 00:31:27,735
You've got a farming simulator, a truck simulator,

621
00:31:28,035 --> 00:31:28,975
just in an instant.

622
00:31:29,296 --> 00:31:29,876
And look at the font.

623
00:31:29,896 --> 00:31:30,796
They're all very similar.

624
00:31:31,096 --> 00:31:33,637
You can tell the genre based on these signifiers

625
00:31:33,657 --> 00:31:34,498
that you've got to learn.

626
00:31:35,658 --> 00:31:35,938
Same thing.

627
00:31:35,978 --> 00:31:38,359
We used to make fun of these FPS covers

628
00:31:38,379 --> 00:31:39,060
that all look the same.

629
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:39,860
But guess what?

630
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,341
You know a first person shooter cover

631
00:31:42,721 --> 00:31:43,762
the second you see it.

632
00:31:44,282 --> 00:31:46,463
We got to learn the tropes of your genre.

633
00:31:47,932 --> 00:31:48,892
Same thing with UI.

634
00:31:49,012 --> 00:31:51,693
When you see the UI, it is like those signifiers

635
00:31:51,733 --> 00:31:52,973
that are in the romance notes.

636
00:31:53,273 --> 00:31:56,814
You gotta learn the tropes and the UI tropes of your genre.

637
00:31:57,734 --> 00:31:59,635
Okay, again, this goes back to coercion.

638
00:31:59,815 --> 00:32:00,815
You're not converting somebody

639
00:32:00,875 --> 00:32:02,576
to try and love that bear book.

640
00:32:03,036 --> 00:32:04,416
You are speaking to the audience

641
00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:06,637
who loves bear shifter romance.

642
00:32:08,878 --> 00:32:10,778
You want people to say when they see your game,

643
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:12,739
this is the game that I've always wanted.

644
00:32:12,959 --> 00:32:14,639
Thank you for giving this wonderful gift to me.

645
00:32:14,659 --> 00:32:16,840
All right, sorry for that diversion.

646
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:17,540
Let's get back to steam.

647
00:32:17,911 --> 00:32:22,675
Okay. After all this, did that person buy that game that they bought on the wish that they

648
00:32:22,715 --> 00:32:26,818
added to the wish list? No. No, it was just a wish list. Then they closed the browser and they

649
00:32:26,838 --> 00:32:33,303
standard their day. When do they actually buy? Steam sales. If you have a game on Steam, you

650
00:32:33,343 --> 00:32:40,108
know most sales come in during the big seasonal sales. So I did part two of this, of the study,

651
00:32:40,348 --> 00:32:42,690
and I'm going to dip into how to manage a Steam sale.

652
00:32:43,771 --> 00:32:45,812
So I'm going to get you from how to get wish lists,

653
00:32:46,112 --> 00:32:48,493
how to go from their wish list to get you into the cart,

654
00:32:49,034 --> 00:32:53,196
how to manage your sales pricing so that it's appropriate

655
00:32:53,256 --> 00:32:54,837
for people who are shopping during a sale,

656
00:32:55,157 --> 00:32:57,118
and how to get from the cart to their library,

657
00:32:57,138 --> 00:32:59,539
how to actually get out of the cart and get purchased.

658
00:33:00,099 --> 00:33:01,420
So let's do part one of this.

659
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,802
Okay, so for this next part, I had six participants

660
00:33:05,982 --> 00:33:07,043
and I did a separate study

661
00:33:07,503 --> 00:33:09,444
that was only part of the Halloween sale.

662
00:33:09,484 --> 00:33:11,025
So what I did was I got everybody who was,

663
00:33:11,714 --> 00:33:14,574
game to do another part three of them were from the previous study that's why

664
00:33:14,594 --> 00:33:17,395
they're orange and then I found three new people who would do this screen

665
00:33:17,435 --> 00:33:21,817
share with me and I told them don't we got a Halloween sale coming up don't

666
00:33:21,837 --> 00:33:25,458
look at the store if the steam sale starts don't talk to your friends about

667
00:33:25,498 --> 00:33:28,699
it please don't open steam don't open those wish list emails that you get I

668
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:31,579
want to see your first impression so they were really good and within the

669
00:33:31,619 --> 00:33:34,420
first two days of the steam sale I got the first impressions of people

670
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,701
shopping on steam during this Halloween sale

671
00:33:37,693 --> 00:33:41,114
So here's how they navigate during a Steam sale.

672
00:33:41,914 --> 00:33:44,435
So they're usually a takeover page on Steam.

673
00:33:44,715 --> 00:33:46,656
They browse it just like they do with the hover,

674
00:33:46,716 --> 00:33:48,156
the mouse catchers where they hold over

675
00:33:48,176 --> 00:33:50,677
and look at the hover, same deal, same rules apply.

676
00:33:51,317 --> 00:33:54,338
The next part is they go and they manage their wishlist.

677
00:33:54,378 --> 00:33:56,179
So they switch over to the wishlist page.

678
00:33:56,539 --> 00:33:58,200
I'm gonna show you an actual video

679
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,501
of somebody browsing their wishlist during a Steam sale.

680
00:34:00,781 --> 00:34:01,161
Here it goes.

681
00:34:02,781 --> 00:34:03,482
So now I'm going to.

682
00:34:05,133 --> 00:34:05,813
By discount.

683
00:34:06,054 --> 00:34:08,075
Did you see? It wasn't price. It was discount.

684
00:34:10,698 --> 00:34:12,559
So these are the usual games.

685
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:14,901
They are pretty much always on sale.

686
00:34:16,082 --> 00:34:16,923
I can buy this one.

687
00:34:21,968 --> 00:34:23,309
How do you know they've always been on sale?

688
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:27,613
Because I have the notification on.

689
00:34:28,053 --> 00:34:31,496
And whenever there's a game on sale, I get an email.

690
00:34:32,479 --> 00:34:35,120
And there are some games I already know by memory

691
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,721
that they have been on sale a lot.

692
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:39,383
For example, this one is on sale every time.

693
00:34:39,403 --> 00:34:40,804
There's a sale every time.

694
00:34:42,625 --> 00:34:44,646
This one has been on sale a few times too.

695
00:34:45,927 --> 00:34:47,848
I added this one recently.

696
00:34:47,868 --> 00:34:49,950
That wasn't a bad thing for him, by the way.

697
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:51,411
He kind of liked it.

698
00:34:51,491 --> 00:34:54,472
I'm not really sure what's this and what's in my wish list,

699
00:34:54,532 --> 00:34:56,914
but I'll look at it later.

700
00:34:59,251 --> 00:35:00,472
Did you hear that last one?

701
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:02,413
Not sure why this is on my wishlist.

702
00:35:02,634 --> 00:35:03,334
I'll look at it later.

703
00:35:04,075 --> 00:35:05,416
I noticed over and over again,

704
00:35:05,676 --> 00:35:08,438
people don't remember why they have games on their wishlist.

705
00:35:08,618 --> 00:35:09,919
It was like there were new games to them.

706
00:35:10,319 --> 00:35:11,460
We love as indies, we think,

707
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,141
oh, as soon as somebody wishlists our game,

708
00:35:13,182 --> 00:35:14,763
they just think and pray every night

709
00:35:15,083 --> 00:35:17,345
that the sale gods are gonna come down

710
00:35:17,585 --> 00:35:20,107
and put that favorite game that I just wishlist on sale.

711
00:35:20,527 --> 00:35:21,648
That is not happening.

712
00:35:21,888 --> 00:35:23,389
People have a lot of games on their wishlist.

713
00:35:23,429 --> 00:35:24,750
They don't even remember how they got on there.

714
00:35:25,182 --> 00:35:32,151
So, you have to treat your page during a sale assuming that people who are coming for the

715
00:35:32,191 --> 00:35:33,893
first time, even if they wish-listed your game.

716
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:38,631
So you want to make it look fresh because I noticed a lot of people when they were going

717
00:35:38,651 --> 00:35:41,651
through their wishlist and they'd look at the page, they wanted to make sure that it wasn't

718
00:35:41,671 --> 00:35:46,912
a dead game. So do stuff to kind of freshen up your page before a Steam sale. That includes

719
00:35:47,193 --> 00:35:52,594
posting a little update alert, theme your capsule to the holiday, put a Santa hat on somebody,

720
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:56,615
post an announcement. That also will show up in the little banners.

721
00:35:57,095 --> 00:35:59,036
of things that have recently been updated.

722
00:35:59,856 --> 00:36:03,138
Upload a small patch so that you can see that the game was recently updated

723
00:36:03,498 --> 00:36:06,860
and comment in the forums. Make sure the forums are still active. So you really

724
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,261
want to make your page kind of freshen it up for the big sales.

725
00:36:10,542 --> 00:36:12,763
Now, he joked about it. You heard him. He said

726
00:36:12,943 --> 00:36:17,586
this game is always on sale. Well guess what? He knew those games that were always on sale.

727
00:36:17,846 --> 00:36:21,748
He didn't know the game that was not on sale. I don't know the strategy.

728
00:36:23,226 --> 00:36:25,526
You might prefer to do fewer sales or more sales.

729
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:26,626
I'll get to that later.

730
00:36:27,067 --> 00:36:28,767
It's up to you, your business model.

731
00:36:29,087 --> 00:36:31,368
But I got to tell you, when you do frequent sales,

732
00:36:31,408 --> 00:36:33,348
when every time there's a sale and your game's on sale,

733
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:34,808
people become familiar with it.

734
00:36:34,989 --> 00:36:37,189
They're not going to have that aspect where they're going to say,

735
00:36:37,489 --> 00:36:38,349
what game is this again?

736
00:36:38,489 --> 00:36:39,990
How did this end up on my Steam page?

737
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:41,450
Why am I wishlisting this?

738
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:43,491
You want to be familiar for your users.

739
00:36:44,851 --> 00:36:46,551
Okay, so how to do pricing.

740
00:36:47,209 --> 00:36:52,231
let's look at this. A lot of the power users actually use second-party sites like GGDeals

741
00:36:52,291 --> 00:36:56,353
or SteamDB, and what they're looking for is something called historic low. Those sites

742
00:36:56,393 --> 00:37:01,736
will actually track if your gains dollar amount, it's not based on percentage, whether the dollar

743
00:37:01,776 --> 00:37:06,038
amount has never been reached before, because it kind of adds a fear of missing out element.

744
00:37:06,518 --> 00:37:11,961
So if you time your big Steam sales with the historic lows, you get a double punch. It's

745
00:37:12,001 --> 00:37:15,102
kind of like a multiplier effect, and people are more encouraged to do it.

746
00:37:15,503 --> 00:37:18,684
Also be careful because historical lows are a limited resource.

747
00:37:18,805 --> 00:37:22,446
Once you go to one price point, you can't be a historic low again for that.

748
00:37:22,727 --> 00:37:25,808
So kind of stair-step your price changes downwards.

749
00:37:26,108 --> 00:37:29,690
Don't go too deep too fast because you miss out on a whole bunch of historic lows.

750
00:37:31,731 --> 00:37:33,212
They'll also check your history.

751
00:37:33,792 --> 00:37:36,914
Those third-party sites will actually show these little histograms.

752
00:37:36,954 --> 00:37:41,296
So they will see, how often does this go on sale and are we in a real deep discount?

753
00:37:41,316 --> 00:37:43,737
Because if you're in a deep discount, they're going to buy your game.

754
00:37:44,703 --> 00:37:46,505
So be strategic about this.

755
00:37:46,625 --> 00:37:49,507
All-time lows are a very non-renewable resource.

756
00:37:50,948 --> 00:37:53,751
Okay, what they do now, when they're on Steam page,

757
00:37:54,111 --> 00:37:55,713
they get buyer's fever.

758
00:37:55,833 --> 00:37:58,135
And so their finger's kind of hovering on the buy button.

759
00:37:58,775 --> 00:38:00,037
They're not sure if they're going to buy it,

760
00:38:00,177 --> 00:38:02,078
so they're looking again at your Steam page

761
00:38:02,118 --> 00:38:03,540
to see if they trust your game.

762
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:04,541
And here's what they do.

763
00:38:04,941 --> 00:38:06,162
They look at a couple key things.

764
00:38:06,422 --> 00:38:07,904
They look at the developer and publisher

765
00:38:07,944 --> 00:38:08,985
to see if they remember them,

766
00:38:09,305 --> 00:38:10,366
if they've noticed them or...

767
00:38:10,784 --> 00:38:14,167
kind of identify the publisher. Of course, people are going to know Xbox Game Studios,

768
00:38:14,487 --> 00:38:19,070
but they want to see if they remember who you are. The other thing they look at is this kind of

769
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:24,915
more from section. And again, they want to see, did they play another one of your games? So,

770
00:38:24,955 --> 00:38:30,118
if your game's in a series, multiple sequels, they want to see, wait, did I play this game?

771
00:38:30,139 --> 00:38:33,601
Was this part of something else? Remember on the video, she said, oh, it's from the Bear With Me

772
00:38:33,641 --> 00:38:38,745
people. She knew some of those folks. You're just building trust that you're going to stick around.

773
00:38:38,825 --> 00:38:40,086
You are a trustworthy developer.

774
00:38:41,386 --> 00:38:42,046
Now what does this mean?

775
00:38:42,526 --> 00:38:46,428
Stay alive, live to make more than one game.

776
00:38:46,448 --> 00:38:48,068
I know you're focused all on this game,

777
00:38:48,308 --> 00:38:49,789
but if you can't survive to your next one,

778
00:38:50,529 --> 00:38:53,450
or if your first one doesn't sell very well, it's okay.

779
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:55,391
Your second one will have that boost

780
00:38:55,411 --> 00:38:58,052
of having more reputable coverage

781
00:38:58,112 --> 00:39:00,533
because your other game is gonna show up

782
00:39:00,573 --> 00:39:01,293
in that more like this.

783
00:39:01,593 --> 00:39:03,434
So it's kind of you're building that reputation.

784
00:39:03,474 --> 00:39:05,575
So please don't quit after your first game,

785
00:39:05,735 --> 00:39:06,815
even if it doesn't sell well.

786
00:39:07,215 --> 00:39:08,816
I know it's hard, but please do.

787
00:39:09,911 --> 00:39:13,473
Okay, so then they do this genre relevance evaluation.

788
00:39:13,693 --> 00:39:17,796
Back to the identification, what they'll do, you know how I said you got to match up just

789
00:39:17,816 --> 00:39:20,098
like a romance novel, they're looking for the genre to make sure.

790
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:22,819
So what they do is they check this bar on the bottom right.

791
00:39:22,839 --> 00:39:24,821
That's a very important bar before they buy.

792
00:39:25,141 --> 00:39:27,843
They'll check this, and what they're doing is this top part where it says,

793
00:39:27,983 --> 00:39:29,244
similar to games you've played.

794
00:39:29,684 --> 00:39:31,185
That helps them identify the genre.

795
00:39:31,345 --> 00:39:33,546
It's just like that guy that said, hey, this is like an FTL.

796
00:39:33,866 --> 00:39:38,790
If that game had an FTL icon in that section, he'd be like, that is perfect.

797
00:39:39,858 --> 00:39:40,859
The other thing that they check,

798
00:39:40,899 --> 00:39:42,420
and this is super duper important,

799
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,762
they look to see their friends recommend it or not.

800
00:39:45,182 --> 00:39:47,504
Because not only do they know the genres that they like,

801
00:39:47,884 --> 00:39:49,365
they know the genres of their friends

802
00:39:49,486 --> 00:39:51,347
and the friends that like certain genres.

803
00:39:51,707 --> 00:39:54,149
So if they see somebody that they trust

804
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:56,791
who also likes the games they like recommending it,

805
00:39:57,072 --> 00:39:58,273
that is such a bonus.

806
00:39:58,633 --> 00:40:00,354
And if a friend recommends against it,

807
00:40:00,634 --> 00:40:01,555
but they know that that person

808
00:40:01,575 --> 00:40:02,436
has different tastes than them,

809
00:40:02,756 --> 00:40:03,577
they're like, oh, it's okay.

810
00:40:04,017 --> 00:40:05,899
He likes FPSs, I don't like FPSs,

811
00:40:05,959 --> 00:40:06,999
it's okay that he hates this game.

812
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:08,240
Okay.

813
00:40:08,601 --> 00:40:08,761
Boom.

814
00:40:09,349 --> 00:40:09,909
They found it.

815
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:11,470
You're a trustworthy dev.

816
00:40:12,051 --> 00:40:12,511
What do they do?

817
00:40:12,671 --> 00:40:13,511
They add it to their cart.

818
00:40:13,952 --> 00:40:14,612
Do they buy it?

819
00:40:15,112 --> 00:40:15,533
Hell no.

820
00:40:15,753 --> 00:40:18,875
They still, after all of that, you are still not clear.

821
00:40:19,995 --> 00:40:21,016
This is the final part.

822
00:40:21,436 --> 00:40:24,498
How do you get out of the cart and into their library?

823
00:40:25,265 --> 00:40:28,147
because it turns out that your Steam cart

824
00:40:28,327 --> 00:40:29,807
is actually a secondary wishlist.

825
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:33,069
And so what they do is they'll actually stop and say,

826
00:40:33,129 --> 00:40:34,749
okay, I've loaded up my cart for the Steam sale.

827
00:40:35,029 --> 00:40:35,970
I'm gonna take a little break.

828
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:37,170
I'm gonna go check with my friends.

829
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:38,591
I wanna see what's gonna happen here.

830
00:40:38,911 --> 00:40:40,812
And so what they do is they step away

831
00:40:41,052 --> 00:40:42,352
and they call all their friends and they say,

832
00:40:42,392 --> 00:40:43,413
I'm thinking of getting this game.

833
00:40:43,793 --> 00:40:45,034
I actually saw this happen.

834
00:40:45,374 --> 00:40:48,536
So one of the participants I was watching, she was considering Sundered.

835
00:40:48,856 --> 00:40:53,258
And what she did was she messaged her friend, who also had a good review for Sundered, and

836
00:40:53,298 --> 00:40:56,500
she in Discord, this is in Discord, she sent him a screenshot of Sundered.

837
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:58,921
And she said, Hey, I'm thinking of buying this.

838
00:40:59,061 --> 00:41:01,363
And he said this, go for it.

839
00:41:01,883 --> 00:41:02,663
And then she bought it.

840
00:41:03,284 --> 00:41:03,944
Imagine that.

841
00:41:04,565 --> 00:41:06,586
All the marketing that had to be done for this to happen.

842
00:41:07,226 --> 00:41:09,227
Those three magic words, go for it.

843
00:41:10,256 --> 00:41:11,898
I don't know how we sell any games at all.

844
00:41:12,439 --> 00:41:14,522
This is how much it takes to get a game sold.

845
00:41:15,804 --> 00:41:17,647
And that comes to the next part, which is word of mouth.

846
00:41:18,188 --> 00:41:19,870
You need to turn your current customers,

847
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:21,172
people who've already bought your game,

848
00:41:21,552 --> 00:41:22,594
into advocates for you.

849
00:41:22,934 --> 00:41:26,039
You need to be offering good support, be friendly.

850
00:41:26,643 --> 00:41:28,325
Don't just run once you have their money.

851
00:41:28,625 --> 00:41:32,469
It's ongoing because they're going to be recommending your game the next time there's

852
00:41:32,509 --> 00:41:36,213
a sale and somebody comes to them and says, hey, do you recommend this person's game?

853
00:41:36,614 --> 00:41:38,055
You better hope that they say yes.

854
00:41:38,476 --> 00:41:40,158
They better hope that they say go for it.

855
00:41:41,219 --> 00:41:43,661
Okay, second part, cart problems.

856
00:41:44,622 --> 00:41:48,366
This is kind of out of our hands, but it really matters here.

857
00:41:49,542 --> 00:41:54,324
Okay, we know when a Steam style starts, they get this email that says you got a wish list on an item on sale.

858
00:41:54,764 --> 00:41:56,125
What are you going to do?

859
00:41:56,185 --> 00:41:59,386
This is a very powerful way of doing it, but guess what?

860
00:41:59,887 --> 00:42:01,747
They put the game, they may have put it in there.

861
00:42:02,148 --> 00:42:04,669
I got this comment from one of the participants that I was studying.

862
00:42:04,949 --> 00:42:09,991
I put Grim Dawn franchise in my cart, but forgot to actually purchase it. Major oof.

863
00:42:10,531 --> 00:42:16,153
My god, they didn't actually go back to their Steam page after that cart, after they checked with all their friends.

864
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:20,996
This is something in the online retail industry called abandoned cart recovery.

865
00:42:21,477 --> 00:42:25,242
When people abandon the cart, they need to be called back to say,

866
00:42:25,262 --> 00:42:26,745
hey, don't forget the sales ending.

867
00:42:27,025 --> 00:42:28,848
Steam does not have abandoned cart recovery.

868
00:42:29,268 --> 00:42:29,909
Let me show you this.

869
00:42:31,151 --> 00:42:33,214
The worldwide, everything like Amazon.

870
00:42:34,004 --> 00:42:38,746
All online retailers estimate that it's like 75% of all people will have stuff left over their cart

871
00:42:39,006 --> 00:42:43,749
and never buy it. This article that I linked below actually said gaming's pretty safe with this.

872
00:42:44,009 --> 00:42:50,813
They only have a 64% abandon rate. Only 64% abandon. Oh my God. But the good news is they

873
00:42:50,873 --> 00:42:57,696
found that if you engage in email marketing and re-engage and say, hey, by the way, sales ending,

874
00:42:57,996 --> 00:43:00,498
you got some items left in the cart. Do you want it? They were able to recover.

875
00:43:01,616 --> 00:43:03,738
10, almost 11% of people were to come back

876
00:43:03,818 --> 00:43:05,960
and actually finish the purchase, 11%.

877
00:43:06,761 --> 00:43:08,063
Now that doesn't sound like much,

878
00:43:08,623 --> 00:43:10,265
but if you go back to your Steam sale,

879
00:43:10,565 --> 00:43:11,486
go back to the last sale,

880
00:43:11,807 --> 00:43:14,309
take whatever you earned in that last Steam sale,

881
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:16,872
multiply that by 10%, add that on,

882
00:43:17,292 --> 00:43:18,293
that's what you missed out

883
00:43:18,333 --> 00:43:21,176
because Steam does not have abandoned cart recovery.

884
00:43:21,637 --> 00:43:22,357
It is a big thing.

885
00:43:23,025 --> 00:43:24,946
It wouldn't be that much that you would need to do.

886
00:43:25,246 --> 00:43:27,648
If we just had an email that Steam would send out,

887
00:43:27,968 --> 00:43:30,949
let's say, a day before the Steam sale ends, and just says,

888
00:43:31,009 --> 00:43:32,330
hey, you've got something left in your cart.

889
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:34,150
Do you want to pick up this game?

890
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:35,191
It's almost there.

891
00:43:35,211 --> 00:43:37,652
There would be a total major oof avoided,

892
00:43:37,692 --> 00:43:39,053
according to that user.

893
00:43:39,113 --> 00:43:39,853
They want this.

894
00:43:40,253 --> 00:43:41,894
They didn't want to miss out on that sale.

895
00:43:43,255 --> 00:43:45,095
Now, next time you have a meeting with Valve,

896
00:43:45,135 --> 00:43:46,596
if you've got one of those behind closed doors,

897
00:43:47,216 --> 00:43:48,537
and they ask for suggestions, say,

898
00:43:48,657 --> 00:43:51,678
please implement an abandoned cart recovery email sequence.

899
00:43:51,955 --> 00:43:55,216
They're going to look at you sideways and say, what?

900
00:43:56,277 --> 00:43:56,877
Explain it to them.

901
00:43:57,057 --> 00:43:57,358
Show them.

902
00:43:57,478 --> 00:43:59,719
Show them what an abandoned card recovery email sequence is.

903
00:44:00,139 --> 00:44:01,020
Hopefully they implement it.

904
00:44:03,121 --> 00:44:03,701
We can't hope.

905
00:44:03,721 --> 00:44:05,402
There's probably some technical reason they can't do it.

906
00:44:05,562 --> 00:44:05,962
I don't know.

907
00:44:06,402 --> 00:44:08,063
But the next best thing that we can do

908
00:44:08,143 --> 00:44:11,205
is plan a big marketing push at the end of a sale.

909
00:44:11,865 --> 00:44:14,567
Make sure that you re-up on your social media,

910
00:44:14,607 --> 00:44:16,908
your email list, say, hey, sale ends tomorrow.

911
00:44:16,968 --> 00:44:17,769
Don't forget to pick up.

912
00:44:17,829 --> 00:44:18,949
If you've got something left in your cart,

913
00:44:18,969 --> 00:44:19,850
don't forget to buy it.

914
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:20,930
It's a.

915
00:44:21,466 --> 00:44:22,027
It's all we got.

916
00:44:22,287 --> 00:44:23,489
We can only do so much.

917
00:44:23,749 --> 00:44:24,511
Bug valve about it.

918
00:44:24,811 --> 00:44:26,033
Hopefully it fixes this.

919
00:44:26,574 --> 00:44:27,635
Okay, so part five.

920
00:44:27,836 --> 00:44:29,879
How to turn those wishlisters into actual buyers.

921
00:44:30,961 --> 00:44:31,742
Okay, so.

922
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:36,532
I published a lot of my findings that I just talked to you about on Gamasutra,

923
00:44:36,552 --> 00:44:38,674
and I got a lot of comments, very good comments that said,

924
00:44:39,054 --> 00:44:41,936
well, the way you were doing the screen share and everything,

925
00:44:41,956 --> 00:44:43,057
you're probably influencing them.

926
00:44:43,277 --> 00:44:45,639
That's probably why people didn't buy as much as what you saw.

927
00:44:46,219 --> 00:44:48,161
And this is something called the Hawthorne effect,

928
00:44:48,221 --> 00:44:52,724
which is when somebody watches, a person being watched changes their behavior.

929
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:54,765
And it dates back to the old factory days.

930
00:44:54,785 --> 00:44:57,928
They wanted to see if they lowered the lights, if it would increase or decrease productivity.

931
00:44:58,288 --> 00:45:00,229
But it was managers who were doing the observation.

932
00:45:00,249 --> 00:45:00,369
So...

933
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:03,293
Of course you're going to work faster when your manager is watching you.

934
00:45:04,294 --> 00:45:08,019
That's besides the point, but this is how we're going to test this. And what I did was

935
00:45:08,359 --> 00:45:12,525
not another screen share for part three of this study. I did a diary study.

936
00:45:13,477 --> 00:45:17,259
And what a diary study is, is I took seven of the participants,

937
00:45:17,459 --> 00:45:18,860
two of them, those are those orange people,

938
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:21,702
from the previous studies, and then I found five new people.

939
00:45:22,142 --> 00:45:24,924
And what I did was every week I sent a survey

940
00:45:24,964 --> 00:45:25,905
that had two questions.

941
00:45:26,325 --> 00:45:27,846
What did you buy last week and why?

942
00:45:28,287 --> 00:45:29,768
And what did you wish list last week?

943
00:45:29,888 --> 00:45:31,148
And how did you hear about it?

944
00:45:31,849 --> 00:45:32,690
That's all I asked them.

945
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:34,651
I sent them in a Google form like this.

946
00:45:35,972 --> 00:45:38,273
And I sent it for three months, starting December 15

947
00:45:38,934 --> 00:45:40,635
and ended just today, March 19.

948
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:44,320
So I would get these little stories back

949
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,081
because they were like little diary entries.

950
00:45:46,301 --> 00:45:48,342
And they're almost like Hemingway-esque

951
00:45:48,382 --> 00:45:50,502
in their simplicity and their just earnestness.

952
00:45:50,923 --> 00:45:51,703
Seven Days to Die.

953
00:45:51,963 --> 00:45:54,004
This early access game has become a favorite of mine.

954
00:45:54,324 --> 00:45:56,164
This was the 11th copy that I purchased.

955
00:45:56,464 --> 00:45:58,025
This time as a Christmas gift for a friend.

956
00:45:58,565 --> 00:46:00,426
God, you better hope that you get this customer.

957
00:46:00,446 --> 00:46:02,146
She bought 11 copies of this game.

958
00:46:03,247 --> 00:46:03,807
Here's another one.

959
00:46:04,187 --> 00:46:05,007
Monopoly Plus.

960
00:46:05,247 --> 00:46:06,808
I sought after looking up board games

961
00:46:06,828 --> 00:46:08,328
to play with my daughter in another state.

962
00:46:08,948 --> 00:46:11,009
It is a game that I have seen on sale for Humble Bundle.

963
00:46:11,487 --> 00:46:14,228
Man, that one gets me every time I read that one.

964
00:46:14,648 --> 00:46:16,789
So these are the type of comments that I got.

965
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:18,090
Here's one for this one.

966
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:18,770
Listen to this.

967
00:46:19,051 --> 00:46:20,431
Demon Crawl.

968
00:46:20,751 --> 00:46:22,772
Saw about it on Discord,

969
00:46:23,133 --> 00:46:24,473
and it looks like something I'd love to play.

970
00:46:24,593 --> 00:46:26,354
Will likely buy it before the end of the sale.

971
00:46:26,915 --> 00:46:29,176
Now, buy it before the end of the sale.

972
00:46:29,336 --> 00:46:30,016
Guess what I did?

973
00:46:30,376 --> 00:46:31,577
I waited till the end of the sale,

974
00:46:31,837 --> 00:46:33,078
way out well after it was over,

975
00:46:33,278 --> 00:46:34,519
and I emailed the guy and I said,

976
00:46:34,919 --> 00:46:36,360
hey, did you get Demon Crawl?

977
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:36,960
Did you ever buy it?

978
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:37,820
Nope.

979
00:46:38,229 --> 00:46:42,611
I ended up forgetting about it and realized too late, like a few hours after the sale

980
00:46:42,671 --> 00:46:42,871
ended.

981
00:46:43,572 --> 00:46:44,552
Abandoned cart.

982
00:46:44,612 --> 00:46:45,573
This is what I'm talking about.

983
00:46:45,613 --> 00:46:46,593
We got to get abandoned cart.

984
00:46:46,813 --> 00:46:47,354
Talk to Steve.

985
00:46:47,514 --> 00:46:48,094
Abandoned cart.

986
00:46:48,654 --> 00:46:48,914
Okay.

987
00:46:49,275 --> 00:46:51,976
So again, I did three months of surveys.

988
00:46:52,236 --> 00:46:53,757
That turned out to be 13 surveys.

989
00:46:54,317 --> 00:46:57,078
I observed or got little messages about 229 wishlisted decisions, 278 buying decisions.

990
00:46:57,118 --> 00:46:58,039
That's 507 of those micro stories.

991
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:06,462
So what I did is I went through and I tagged them based on what they said,

992
00:47:06,502 --> 00:47:11,266
whether they got it from Discord or Steam or a bundle, who told them about the game,

993
00:47:11,326 --> 00:47:13,587
all that stuff. Here's what I found. Here's the research.

994
00:47:14,528 --> 00:47:17,911
Okay, so the top list is all the participants, the seven participants.

995
00:47:18,531 --> 00:47:24,496
Just underneath, I'm listing them in columns. So participant A bought 24 games between

996
00:47:24,876 --> 00:47:26,277
December 15th and March 9th.

997
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:29,613
Participant D bought 86 games in that three months,

998
00:47:29,753 --> 00:47:32,697
all the way over to participant O, who bought 62 games

999
00:47:32,737 --> 00:47:33,377
during that period.

1000
00:47:33,658 --> 00:47:34,439
This is purchase.

1001
00:47:35,961 --> 00:47:37,162
This is how many they wish-listed.

1002
00:47:37,182 --> 00:47:40,186
So A bought 27, O bought 32, reads like that.

1003
00:47:40,246 --> 00:47:42,148
I'm going to break it down based on all the things they did.

1004
00:47:43,229 --> 00:47:45,572
Again, these are only purchases and wishlists

1005
00:47:46,053 --> 00:47:46,934
during that time period.

1006
00:47:47,771 --> 00:47:51,940
Okay, how many, what percentage based on Steam? Because some people played Switch games or they

1007
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:56,711
bought Xbox games. I included those in the survey and I tracked them. So how many of them included

1008
00:47:56,751 --> 00:47:57,272
Steam games?

1009
00:47:58,129 --> 00:48:04,252
It's a pretty high number, 42%, 53%, 76% of the games that were bought during this time period

1010
00:48:04,272 --> 00:48:08,614
were for Steam. I counted anything that was Humble Bundle, even if they get a Steam key from Humble,

1011
00:48:08,914 --> 00:48:13,137
as a separate thing, and I'll show that in a minute. You might notice participant L had zero

1012
00:48:13,197 --> 00:48:17,199
Steam games. He was boycotting Steam at the beginning, and I was like, I wonder if he's

1013
00:48:17,219 --> 00:48:22,141
going to stick to his boycott. He did. He did not buy any Steam games during that three-month period,

1014
00:48:22,401 --> 00:48:23,202
so very good on him.

1015
00:48:24,694 --> 00:48:28,597
Okay, so how many of these purchases were from Humble Bundle?

1016
00:48:29,378 --> 00:48:33,702
Turns out a very high percentage of people get their games from Humble Bundle.

1017
00:48:34,002 --> 00:48:38,246
So if you notice, D and K, they have very large inventories of games that they purchased.

1018
00:48:38,527 --> 00:48:41,009
That's because they're big buyers of Humble Bundle games.

1019
00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:44,532
Fanatical Bundle was another bundle that a lot of people bought off of.

1020
00:48:44,933 --> 00:48:48,676
Some people were not bundle buyers, like M&M. They just didn't get any bundles.

1021
00:48:49,992 --> 00:48:54,475
Now, let's check social media. So, one of the questions, like, did you buy this game and why?

1022
00:48:54,935 --> 00:48:59,197
If they said, oh, I bought it on Twitter, I saw somebody on Twitter tweet about the game,

1023
00:48:59,257 --> 00:49:05,580
so I bought it. How many? Nobody. Nobody mentioned that they found a game based on Twitter.

1024
00:49:06,761 --> 00:49:11,683
Let's talk about Discord. How many? One person heard about a game on Discord and then bought it.

1025
00:49:12,684 --> 00:49:17,186
And then Reddit? One person. One person bought a game because they saw it on Reddit.

1026
00:49:17,966 --> 00:49:18,126
Now,

1027
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:22,022
That's kind of strange, but if you remember,

1028
00:49:22,803 --> 00:49:24,023
top of the funnel, bottom of the funnel,

1029
00:49:24,043 --> 00:49:24,964
I always talk about that stuff.

1030
00:49:26,224 --> 00:49:27,905
Nobody, I always say, nobody sees the game

1031
00:49:27,925 --> 00:49:28,906
for the first time and then buys it.

1032
00:49:29,066 --> 00:49:30,487
That's true, and that's what this study did.

1033
00:49:30,967 --> 00:49:32,948
So I looked at the wishlist, I looked at top of the funnel.

1034
00:49:33,148 --> 00:49:34,449
How many people wishlisted a game

1035
00:49:34,529 --> 00:49:37,110
and claimed that they wishlisted because of Twitter?

1036
00:49:37,671 --> 00:49:40,132
So same thing, let's see, three people.

1037
00:49:40,372 --> 00:49:41,913
Three people said they saw a game on Twitter,

1038
00:49:42,133 --> 00:49:43,034
and so they wishlisted it.

1039
00:49:43,474 --> 00:49:45,355
Discord, a little bit higher, six people.

1040
00:49:46,576 --> 00:49:47,096
And then Reddit, 12.

1041
00:49:48,671 --> 00:49:50,452
Now, participant D loves Reddit.

1042
00:49:50,812 --> 00:49:53,754
So he's a very heavy Reddit user, but he was the only one.

1043
00:49:54,034 --> 00:49:56,415
And side note, I've found a lot of these people on Reddit.

1044
00:49:56,796 --> 00:49:58,376
They just don't shop for games on Reddit.

1045
00:49:59,397 --> 00:50:01,018
Okay, what about streamers?

1046
00:50:01,258 --> 00:50:02,819
How many people buy games because of streamers?

1047
00:50:03,219 --> 00:50:04,300
So let's look at wishlists.

1048
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:09,523
So because of what they saw on like a streamer do it,

1049
00:50:10,023 --> 00:50:12,584
bought that, that's not great, but it's something.

1050
00:50:12,925 --> 00:50:15,066
How many purchases based on what they saw on a streamer?

1051
00:50:15,426 --> 00:50:17,107
Not many, three people see it on purchase.

1052
00:50:17,587 --> 00:50:22,592
Really, it's a wish list to purchase conversion. Now, I think part of it might be that they wish

1053
00:50:22,632 --> 00:50:27,617
listed it long time ago. So if they may, in my data, they didn't actually say that they bought

1054
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:33,462
it because of watching somebody on YouTube. But I really think wish lists don't straight convert

1055
00:50:33,502 --> 00:50:39,148
to purchases based on streamers. Okay, now I've mentioned friends all the time. These are kind of

1056
00:50:39,188 --> 00:50:39,288
what

1057
00:50:39,842 --> 00:50:41,804
if anybody tagged a friend, if they said,

1058
00:50:42,064 --> 00:50:43,866
hey, I have friends who play this,

1059
00:50:43,886 --> 00:50:45,907
so I bought it because of that, I did that.

1060
00:50:46,167 --> 00:50:48,309
I also counted if they bought a game for a friend,

1061
00:50:48,649 --> 00:50:49,250
this will be it.

1062
00:50:49,991 --> 00:50:53,573
If they were gifted a game, I tagged that as a friend buy.

1063
00:50:53,874 --> 00:50:55,535
So how many games did they buy

1064
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:57,276
because of a friend recommendation?

1065
00:50:58,257 --> 00:50:58,618
Let's see.

1066
00:50:59,798 --> 00:51:00,879
A pretty high amount.

1067
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:04,242
Some of these participants like L and N,

1068
00:51:05,363 --> 00:51:07,405
50% of their games came from friend recommendations.

1069
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:10,156
Friends are very, very important in buying games.

1070
00:51:11,076 --> 00:51:11,877
What about wishlists?

1071
00:51:12,537 --> 00:51:14,898
Just as high, a third in some cases.

1072
00:51:15,318 --> 00:51:16,999
Now, you might notice participant D

1073
00:51:17,559 --> 00:51:19,861
does not actually have any friends.

1074
00:51:20,181 --> 00:51:21,001
No, he has friends.

1075
00:51:21,041 --> 00:51:21,922
I actually asked him, I was like,

1076
00:51:21,942 --> 00:51:22,342
yeah, you okay?

1077
00:51:22,362 --> 00:51:23,242
Maybe you have friends?

1078
00:51:23,462 --> 00:51:25,183
He does, he just doesn't have gamer friends.

1079
00:51:25,243 --> 00:51:26,584
All his friends do other activities.

1080
00:51:27,024 --> 00:51:27,664
Who knows what they do,

1081
00:51:27,704 --> 00:51:28,985
but they don't play games together.

1082
00:51:30,646 --> 00:51:32,006
Okay, how many gamers,

1083
00:51:32,407 --> 00:51:34,648
how many of these participants bought games at full price?

1084
00:51:35,788 --> 00:51:36,208
Zero.

1085
00:51:37,093 --> 00:51:39,294
Zero people bought games at full price.

1086
00:51:39,814 --> 00:51:41,054
Isn't that astounding?

1087
00:51:41,774 --> 00:51:43,435
These people wait for sales.

1088
00:51:44,275 --> 00:51:46,295
I know it's not a surprise, but my God,

1089
00:51:46,415 --> 00:51:47,976
looking at all those zeros, there's a surprise.

1090
00:51:48,516 --> 00:51:51,736
Okay, so what gets people from wishlist to purchase?

1091
00:51:52,076 --> 00:51:52,776
How do they actually do it?

1092
00:51:52,936 --> 00:51:53,917
I got one of these comments,

1093
00:51:53,937 --> 00:51:54,777
because I'm always wondering,

1094
00:51:54,817 --> 00:51:56,097
like how do I convert somebody

1095
00:51:56,117 --> 00:51:57,937
from being wishlisting it to actually buying it?

1096
00:51:58,418 --> 00:51:59,358
And here's this guy.

1097
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:01,178
He said, Stardew Valley, was tempted,

1098
00:52:01,218 --> 00:52:02,418
but I have some unfinished business

1099
00:52:02,458 --> 00:52:04,199
with one of my Harvest Mootin' games on Wii.

1100
00:52:04,499 --> 00:52:06,599
We'll finish that first before buying Stardew Valley.

1101
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:10,482
What? Like, we have to now compete with Wii.

1102
00:52:11,083 --> 00:52:13,606
Like, who knows why people buy games?

1103
00:52:14,226 --> 00:52:17,810
There's no reason. We just have to basically keep pushing on it, keep pushing on it.

1104
00:52:18,070 --> 00:52:22,655
You just have to market all the time because who knows when somebody is going to finish that Wii game?

1105
00:52:22,936 --> 00:52:24,397
I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do.

1106
00:52:24,817 --> 00:52:27,040
So games have a long life cycle.

1107
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:28,381
Stay alive. Stay alive.

1108
00:52:28,421 --> 00:52:29,202
Just whatever may occur.

1109
00:52:30,590 --> 00:52:33,251
Okay, so what actually moved the needle after doing all this research?

1110
00:52:33,531 --> 00:52:33,731
Okay.

1111
00:52:33,871 --> 00:52:36,092
Bundles were the highest percentage of the converted to

1112
00:52:36,132 --> 00:52:37,292
actually purchasing something.

1113
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:39,073
Next down was friends.

1114
00:52:39,333 --> 00:52:42,254
Now bundles, we get like fractions of a cent in some of those bundles,

1115
00:52:42,274 --> 00:52:43,195
so it doesn't quite count.

1116
00:52:43,635 --> 00:52:45,536
So the number one thing is friends.

1117
00:52:46,276 --> 00:52:46,396
Now.

1118
00:52:47,529 --> 00:52:52,793
full price purchases were zero, which means sales actually drive a lot. But I can't quite identify

1119
00:52:52,853 --> 00:52:57,316
how many sales came from not being mentioned on friends and bundles. It's kind of like asking

1120
00:52:57,356 --> 00:53:01,699
somebody, asking a fish about water. They don't even notice it. A lot of these participants

1121
00:53:01,759 --> 00:53:05,641
wishlisted things and bought things just because they were on the Steam front page and all that

1122
00:53:05,661 --> 00:53:09,544
kind of stuff. So I think those are the major drivers. But the things we can kind of control

1123
00:53:09,584 --> 00:53:12,626
are purchases because of friends and getting your game in bundles.

1124
00:53:13,638 --> 00:53:17,459
So here's kind of the top recommendations based on the second round of research.

1125
00:53:17,959 --> 00:53:19,620
Make a really good game that people recommend.

1126
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,361
Stars around that, that's the most important thing.

1127
00:53:21,641 --> 00:53:23,241
People aren't going to recommend your game if it isn't good.

1128
00:53:23,361 --> 00:53:25,322
That's why we say start with a good game to market.

1129
00:53:26,142 --> 00:53:26,383
Okay.

1130
00:53:27,303 --> 00:53:28,884
Develop a plan for word of mouth marketing.

1131
00:53:29,344 --> 00:53:32,845
We got to invest in how we get our games shareable, not through social media,

1132
00:53:32,865 --> 00:53:34,506
because apparently they don't do it through social media.

1133
00:53:34,786 --> 00:53:38,587
Just make sure that friends know, maybe bundle two keys so that somebody

1134
00:53:38,607 --> 00:53:40,108
will give a key to a friend, who knows?

1135
00:53:40,388 --> 00:53:42,188
But think of ways to do word of mouth marketing.

1136
00:53:42,839 --> 00:53:44,200
Put your game on sale a lot.

1137
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:46,342
We know that people only buy it on sale.

1138
00:53:46,722 --> 00:53:50,484
I told you that when frequent sales happen,

1139
00:53:50,965 --> 00:53:52,186
your game is more front of mind.

1140
00:53:52,806 --> 00:53:54,107
And eventually put it in a bundle,

1141
00:53:54,227 --> 00:53:55,288
maybe a windowing system.

1142
00:53:55,328 --> 00:53:56,489
Eventually you'll end up in a bundle

1143
00:53:56,749 --> 00:53:58,990
because that really does drive people to buy your game.

1144
00:54:00,251 --> 00:54:01,432
And I guess just wait for people

1145
00:54:01,452 --> 00:54:02,493
to finish all their games on Wii.

1146
00:54:02,813 --> 00:54:03,573
Who knows? I don't know.

1147
00:54:04,138 --> 00:54:08,360
Okay, wrap it up. Let's do this. I keep all this research while I was doing I

1148
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,661
kept thinking I'm like, I'm gonna have to present this to a bunch of indies. I'm

1149
00:54:10,701 --> 00:54:13,822
gonna have to tell them to like, put their game on sale a lot. I'm gonna have

1150
00:54:13,842 --> 00:54:17,043
to tell them to stick to genres. Don't be too crazy. Don't have too many hooks.

1151
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:21,125
Don't be too out there. Just stick to genre conventions. Like, I keep

1152
00:54:21,145 --> 00:54:25,706
thinking of that guy, like, why even be indie anymore? It's true. Like, I

1153
00:54:25,766 --> 00:54:26,487
wonder about this, but

1154
00:54:27,679 --> 00:54:29,240
Here's the thing, this is kind of what I came around to.

1155
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,201
Your Steam page, we saw with that woman

1156
00:54:31,221 --> 00:54:33,783
who went through the Steam page, it lasts 90 seconds.

1157
00:54:33,823 --> 00:54:35,664
They shop for 90 seconds on your store page.

1158
00:54:36,124 --> 00:54:38,666
They are gonna forget your store page by the end of it,

1159
00:54:39,006 --> 00:54:40,107
but your game will live on.

1160
00:54:40,667 --> 00:54:43,649
So this Steam, you can be cheesy and trite

1161
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:45,790
on your Steam page, that's not your art.

1162
00:54:46,130 --> 00:54:47,871
Your Steam page is not your art.

1163
00:54:48,671 --> 00:54:51,093
And a key thing, I kind of realized this when I heard about this.

1164
00:54:51,133 --> 00:54:54,315
So this is Marcel Proust, famous 20th century author,

1165
00:54:54,335 --> 00:54:57,337
you know, one of the greatest thinkers we've got in the 20th century.

1166
00:54:58,378 --> 00:55:01,460
It turns out, here he is, his first book was something called

1167
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,801
Remembrance of Things Past, right? Smart guy.

1168
00:55:04,682 --> 00:55:09,805
OK, for Marcel Proust, Le Figaro was the front page.

1169
00:55:09,845 --> 00:55:11,386
It was his Steam page, equivalently.

1170
00:55:11,406 --> 00:55:13,788
Like, if you wanted to sell 20th century literature to Frenchmen,

1171
00:55:14,128 --> 00:55:14,948
this is where you put it.

1172
00:55:15,958 --> 00:55:20,521
And he got a bunch of front page reviews for his Remembrance of Things past, right?

1173
00:55:21,502 --> 00:55:27,987
Well, they recently had an auction for some of Proust's old letters, and they were going through his letters, and they found out

1174
00:55:28,688 --> 00:55:31,410
that Proust actually paid people the equivalent of

1175
00:55:31,690 --> 00:55:36,734
$900 in today's dollars to write favorable reviews for him on the front page of the Sleif Agar.

1176
00:55:37,308 --> 00:55:41,189
Now, I'm not, Steam, I'm not telling them to buy reviews.

1177
00:55:41,229 --> 00:55:43,610
I'm not, if you're Steam, don't kick my games off Steam.

1178
00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:46,310
What I'm actually saying is, he hustled.

1179
00:55:47,270 --> 00:55:47,790
He hustled.

1180
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:51,511
And he knew that sometimes you have to

1181
00:55:52,091 --> 00:55:55,432
really change your policies in order to get your art seen.

1182
00:55:55,952 --> 00:55:58,432
And really what Marcel Proust kind of did was,

1183
00:55:58,652 --> 00:55:59,452
we don't remember it.

1184
00:55:59,892 --> 00:56:01,993
It wasn't until we dug deep into his letters

1185
00:56:02,353 --> 00:56:03,953
that we found out that his page was trite

1186
00:56:04,353 --> 00:56:06,673
and that his items were bought.

1187
00:56:07,096 --> 00:56:09,738
We remember his art, not what he did on Le Figaro.

1188
00:56:09,958 --> 00:56:11,599
Nobody remembers what he did on Le Figaro.

1189
00:56:12,179 --> 00:56:14,740
So what I'm saying is, just get that hustle, do it.

1190
00:56:15,141 --> 00:56:17,022
So he actually actually got his friend

1191
00:56:17,062 --> 00:56:20,103
who painted this portrait, name listed off to the left

1192
00:56:20,123 --> 00:56:21,024
so I don't butcher the French,

1193
00:56:21,844 --> 00:56:23,285
he got him to write one of the reviews.

1194
00:56:23,465 --> 00:56:25,927
So use your resources, don't cheat the system,

1195
00:56:25,967 --> 00:56:29,529
don't buy reviews, but your store page is not your art.

1196
00:56:29,729 --> 00:56:30,549
Separate those two.

1197
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:34,251
Please, your page is not your art.

1198
00:56:34,452 --> 00:56:35,792
Be a little bit cliche.

1199
00:56:36,453 --> 00:56:36,633
Okay.

1200
00:56:37,437 --> 00:56:41,960
I called this talk Empathize with Steam because, I don't know, we look at all these sales charts,

1201
00:56:42,381 --> 00:56:46,464
we look at these number of reviews, and we just hate these people that just say nope.

1202
00:56:46,844 --> 00:56:48,525
And we kind of hate Steam.

1203
00:56:49,126 --> 00:56:54,670
But after watching this and reading stuff like this, a person who wanted to play games

1204
00:56:54,730 --> 00:56:58,833
with her daughter in another state, I don't know, I kind of got this feeling.

1205
00:56:58,853 --> 00:57:04,176
There's this feeling called sonder, which is basically that says, everybody, every random

1206
00:57:04,216 --> 00:57:05,737
passerby actually has a full life.

1207
00:57:06,871 --> 00:57:08,612
I thought about that when I did this research,

1208
00:57:08,632 --> 00:57:10,333
is every negative review,

1209
00:57:10,353 --> 00:57:12,154
they're probably having a bad day or something.

1210
00:57:12,174 --> 00:57:15,755
And all those upvotes are probably from somebody else

1211
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:16,916
who's also having a bad day.

1212
00:57:17,336 --> 00:57:18,456
And so what I'm telling you is,

1213
00:57:18,757 --> 00:57:20,457
if you kind of feel down about doing this stuff,

1214
00:57:21,058 --> 00:57:22,078
go do what I did.

1215
00:57:22,178 --> 00:57:24,779
Talk to Steam people, not the crazy ones, not the mean ones,

1216
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:26,900
but find people and talk to them.

1217
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,361
And don't just treat them like a number,

1218
00:57:28,401 --> 00:57:30,642
like, oh, this many upvotes, this many downvotes.

1219
00:57:31,002 --> 00:57:32,363
Really, learn your audience.

1220
00:57:32,943 --> 00:57:35,124
And I think it's gonna be a real positive feeling for you.

1221
00:57:35,564 --> 00:57:36,165
So please do it.

1222
00:57:37,781 --> 00:57:41,263
Again, if you want that Steam checklist, go to my website, howtomarketagame.com slash

1223
00:57:41,783 --> 00:57:42,503
Steam checklist.

1224
00:57:43,004 --> 00:57:45,545
I'll send you a free version of that if you sign up for my newsletter.

1225
00:57:46,505 --> 00:57:50,948
If you have questions, this is a weird GDC this year, so I'll answer them on Twitter.

1226
00:57:51,228 --> 00:57:51,728
Please do it.

1227
00:57:51,948 --> 00:57:52,549
Thank you very much.

1228
00:57:52,909 --> 00:57:53,829
I appreciate your time.

1229
00:57:53,889 --> 00:57:54,630
Thanks for coming out.

1230
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:56,250
I love you all.

1231
00:57:57,611 --> 00:57:57,991
Have a good day.
