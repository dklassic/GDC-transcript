1
00:00:05,965 --> 00:00:09,507
So I am Amanda Gardner, and this is Time Is On Your Side,

2
00:00:09,827 --> 00:00:13,249
Personal Time Management Strategies for Crunch and Beyond.

3
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,211
I'll tell you a little bit about myself.

4
00:00:16,611 --> 00:00:18,832
So I am the co-founder of The Deep End Games

5
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:19,913
with my husband, Bill Gardner,

6
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:21,193
who worked on the Bioshock series.

7
00:00:22,014 --> 00:00:25,435
In 2017, we launched Perception on all major platforms.

8
00:00:25,496 --> 00:00:27,677
We made that game in our basement, which was pretty cool.

9
00:00:29,137 --> 00:00:32,239
And I'm also a yoga teacher, a meditation teacher.

10
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:33,960
I have four kids.

11
00:00:35,401 --> 00:00:36,922
And I'm also a fantasy writer.

12
00:00:37,382 --> 00:00:42,506
So the reason why I'm here and speaking on this particular subject is I let

13
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:48,870
poor time management and sort of poor self-care get the best of me.

14
00:00:49,111 --> 00:00:52,633
And I got extremely ill during the production of Perception.

15
00:00:53,013 --> 00:00:58,737
So I'm here to talk about ways that you can sort of make yourself feel better and

16
00:00:59,578 --> 00:01:01,619
basically get more time out of your day.

17
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:07,113
So I'm going to start with something that seems a little off topic, peanut allergies.

18
00:01:07,993 --> 00:01:10,614
Three out of my four children have nut allergies.

19
00:01:11,114 --> 00:01:13,275
I am the general grievous of EpiPens.

20
00:01:13,535 --> 00:01:15,615
I have them everywhere at all times.

21
00:01:17,016 --> 00:01:20,136
And I've become a real expert on cross-contamination,

22
00:01:20,196 --> 00:01:23,557
keeping my kids safe when we go to restaurants and other houses.

23
00:01:24,577 --> 00:01:27,458
But I'm not an expert on restaurant best practices.

24
00:01:27,978 --> 00:01:30,759
I don't even know how peanut allergies began,

25
00:01:30,839 --> 00:01:32,139
and I'm not a medical professional.

26
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,480
Now, how does that relate to crunch?

27
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:36,840
Not crunchy peanut butter.

28
00:01:39,181 --> 00:01:42,802
it relates because I'm not here to debate about crunch.

29
00:01:43,542 --> 00:01:45,222
Crunch happens and when it's gone,

30
00:01:45,282 --> 00:01:46,423
I'll stop talking about it.

31
00:01:46,683 --> 00:01:49,804
But for now, I want to be an advocate for people

32
00:01:50,124 --> 00:01:52,304
and to help anybody who's either going through crunch

33
00:01:52,344 --> 00:01:56,405
or about to go crunch, or just any game dev ever

34
00:01:56,485 --> 00:01:59,546
because game development is about time management anyway.

35
00:01:59,646 --> 00:02:00,726
So this is for.

36
00:02:01,527 --> 00:02:06,830
for everybody. So it wasn't just crunch that made me sick. I had too much going

37
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,911
on. I was working several jobs at one point

38
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:13,833
four. I had a newborn. I had a toddler who was only a year

39
00:02:13,853 --> 00:02:18,076
older. I had a couple elementary schoolers and I got mono

40
00:02:18,396 --> 00:02:20,997
from all the stress. I mean talk about

41
00:02:21,518 --> 00:02:24,279
just overload. It was really, really,

42
00:02:24,779 --> 00:02:27,701
really bad. Now how did I get out?

43
00:02:29,453 --> 00:02:31,655
I say that I went to minivan university.

44
00:02:32,536 --> 00:02:34,379
I have to drive my kids all over creation

45
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:35,400
in addition to working.

46
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,484
So instead of listening to music or podcasts

47
00:02:38,524 --> 00:02:40,446
that sort of are fun but don't really have a thesis,

48
00:02:40,787 --> 00:02:43,930
I listened to over 100 personal development audio books.

49
00:02:44,511 --> 00:02:46,292
in my car for free, mind you.

50
00:02:46,312 --> 00:02:47,492
So this is a little side note.

51
00:02:47,952 --> 00:02:49,853
Audiobooks don't have to be 25 bucks a pop.

52
00:02:50,053 --> 00:02:52,994
All you have to do is get the Libby app, L-I-B-B-Y,

53
00:02:53,354 --> 00:02:54,755
link your library card to it,

54
00:02:54,815 --> 00:02:56,996
and there are hundreds of free audiobooks.

55
00:02:57,056 --> 00:02:57,736
It's the best.

56
00:02:58,256 --> 00:02:59,837
Anyway, I learned yoga.

57
00:02:59,857 --> 00:03:03,258
I got heavily meditated, lots of meditation.

58
00:03:03,278 --> 00:03:07,160
I completely revamped my diet and my nutrition in general,

59
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,321
and I adopted a lot of the strategies that I learned

60
00:03:10,421 --> 00:03:12,442
from all of these personal development books.

61
00:03:13,607 --> 00:03:15,169
And those are the ones I'm going to talk about today.

62
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:16,791
These are some of the highlights for me.

63
00:03:16,871 --> 00:03:20,135
So Deepak Chopra has this really great program

64
00:03:20,175 --> 00:03:22,738
he does with Oprah, Oprah and Chopra, a power couple.

65
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,341
They do Making Every Moment Matter.

66
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,411
The Power of Full Engagement by Tony Schwartz and Jim Lehrer is really,

67
00:03:29,451 --> 00:03:30,472
really an interesting one.

68
00:03:30,912 --> 00:03:35,534
The Desire Map by Daniela Port is a completely new take on goal setting.

69
00:03:36,254 --> 00:03:41,616
Tony Robbins does the massive planning method, sorry, rapid planning method.

70
00:03:42,356 --> 00:03:46,758
And I'm gonna be teaching one of the seven habits of highly effective people.

71
00:03:47,118 --> 00:03:50,059
And lastly, The Slight Edge by Jeff Olson,

72
00:03:50,679 --> 00:03:53,620
it really was one of the biggest game changers for me in my life.

73
00:03:54,657 --> 00:03:56,279
So Mrs. Gardner's advice.

74
00:03:56,659 --> 00:03:59,321
I spent my career before I was a game dev

75
00:03:59,381 --> 00:04:02,284
as a high school English teacher for over a decade.

76
00:04:03,005 --> 00:04:05,347
My students would come in burnt out.

77
00:04:05,427 --> 00:04:06,247
I taught honors kids.

78
00:04:06,768 --> 00:04:08,770
And they would come in on three hours of sleep

79
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:11,392
because they're taking five honors and AP classes,

80
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:13,113
they're in every single sport,

81
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:14,534
and they're doing every extracurricular,

82
00:04:14,575 --> 00:04:16,596
and they were coming to me and they were breaking down.

83
00:04:16,897 --> 00:04:17,537
And finally I just said,

84
00:04:17,677 --> 00:04:18,878
all right everybody, here's what we're doing.

85
00:04:19,219 --> 00:04:21,380
You guys are planning out your schedule and time management

86
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,521
because you're all burning out.

87
00:04:22,882 --> 00:04:25,748
So I took this jar, I found this on the internet, I didn't tell them this,

88
00:04:25,768 --> 00:04:28,173
I found this jar and I put a bunch of big rocks in it.

89
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:30,518
And I said, is there any room in that?

90
00:04:30,618 --> 00:04:33,144
And they said, eh, not really.

91
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,861
I said, this is your life, this jar, okay?

92
00:04:38,121 --> 00:04:41,302
And these big rocks are the things you can't move in your schedule.

93
00:04:41,722 --> 00:04:43,883
Everybody get out a blank paper, I said to them,

94
00:04:44,323 --> 00:04:46,803
and write down the things in your schedule that are indelible,

95
00:04:46,843 --> 00:04:48,584
you cannot change them. They wrote a bunch of things down.

96
00:04:48,944 --> 00:04:51,305
And then I got out a little jar of glass beads and I poured it in.

97
00:04:51,345 --> 00:04:52,545
I said, see, there was more room.

98
00:04:52,605 --> 00:04:54,066
They were, oh, I see what you're doing.

99
00:04:54,626 --> 00:04:57,707
And I said, these glass beads are the things that are shoulds.

100
00:04:58,067 --> 00:04:59,027
You should do this.

101
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,041
add that. And then they started to add some things to their schedule. I said, for example,

102
00:05:03,081 --> 00:05:06,402
instead of cramming one night before a test, why don't we break it up in a couple nights?

103
00:05:06,422 --> 00:05:09,864
And they're sitting there writing. I said, you guys, is it full? And they were like,

104
00:05:09,884 --> 00:05:13,905
yeah, it's full. Then I got sand, poured the sand on top. And I said, OK, these are like

105
00:05:13,945 --> 00:05:18,928
the optional things. OK, maybe if you have a little room in your schedule, you can put it in.

106
00:05:18,968 --> 00:05:22,829
You have more time than you think, you guys. You're just spending it on.

107
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,170
not things that are terribly important.

108
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:27,471
And then they were like, now it's full, Mrs. G.

109
00:05:27,491 --> 00:05:28,271
And I was like, no.

110
00:05:28,371 --> 00:05:30,212
And I took out a bottle of water, and I poured it in.

111
00:05:30,252 --> 00:05:32,253
I said, none of this will get done if you're not hydrated,

112
00:05:32,273 --> 00:05:32,833
so drink your water.

113
00:05:33,313 --> 00:05:36,974
So that was sort of my first foray into time management.

114
00:05:36,994 --> 00:05:39,755
But that's still how I plan a lot of my days.

115
00:05:40,216 --> 00:05:43,277
So we're going to get into the first real professional

116
00:05:43,357 --> 00:05:46,598
strategy, and that is the power of full engagement.

117
00:05:46,938 --> 00:05:49,639
So Tony Schwartz and James Lehrer did a really

118
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:50,299
interesting thing.

119
00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:52,620
They went out and they studied professional athletes.

120
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:56,404
and took their strategies into the workplace.

121
00:05:56,764 --> 00:05:59,246
So you think of the way an athlete trains

122
00:05:59,286 --> 00:06:02,149
and the way an athlete works, and it's just not like work.

123
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:06,092
They spend 80% of their time preparing

124
00:06:06,412 --> 00:06:08,594
for the 20% that they're executing.

125
00:06:08,955 --> 00:06:10,896
They are working out, stretching,

126
00:06:11,317 --> 00:06:12,678
eating right, sleeping right.

127
00:06:12,858 --> 00:06:13,959
Athletes do 80% prep for 20% engagement.

128
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,584
That engagement is called peak flow.

129
00:06:20,965 --> 00:06:23,509
And Angela Duckworth talks about it in her book, Grit,

130
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:24,812
which I highly recommend.

131
00:06:25,353 --> 00:06:27,516
Anyway, I mean, is that how game does work?

132
00:06:27,536 --> 00:06:29,139
Like what if we spend our 80% of our,

133
00:06:29,179 --> 00:06:30,321
like what, we can't do that.

134
00:06:31,311 --> 00:06:32,172
You actually can.

135
00:06:32,532 --> 00:06:34,753
So what they found is if you sit down

136
00:06:34,873 --> 00:06:36,454
at the beginning of your workday

137
00:06:37,035 --> 00:06:39,596
and you spend time getting in the zone,

138
00:06:39,676 --> 00:06:41,297
getting ready to execute,

139
00:06:41,657 --> 00:06:43,859
you can put yourself in that peak flow state

140
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:45,540
where you will get so much more done

141
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,301
and you will get so much better quality.

142
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:49,362
It's astounding.

143
00:06:49,682 --> 00:06:51,243
So I actually tried this.

144
00:06:52,508 --> 00:06:54,508
uh... and then you know it nano rhyme always

145
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:56,749
so it's national novel writing month

146
00:06:57,149 --> 00:07:00,270
and essentially in a month you write an entire book now

147
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:03,191
i've got four kids a job teaching gigs and what not

148
00:07:03,751 --> 00:07:08,293
i wrote it giant fantasy novel in thirty days by using this method what i did was

149
00:07:08,393 --> 00:07:09,313
every morning i go to the gym

150
00:07:09,653 --> 00:07:11,013
it's a non-negotiable for me

151
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,695
But what I did was, when I got on the treadmill,

152
00:07:13,775 --> 00:07:15,876
I put in a playlist for my book in my head.

153
00:07:15,976 --> 00:07:18,297
And as I worked out, I was planning

154
00:07:18,357 --> 00:07:19,378
what I was going to write.

155
00:07:19,718 --> 00:07:22,060
And then as soon as the workout was done, I grabbed my laptop.

156
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,160
I bring my laptop to the gym.

157
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:27,823
And I burned 3,000 words a day in an hour.

158
00:07:27,843 --> 00:07:30,785
And I managed to write a big, fat book.

159
00:07:31,025 --> 00:07:34,087
So if you plan enough, you can get in peak flow

160
00:07:34,147 --> 00:07:35,287
and get so much more done.

161
00:07:35,347 --> 00:07:36,608
It's actually really incredible.

162
00:07:37,649 --> 00:07:41,593
Another thing these two researchers found out is that,

163
00:07:41,613 --> 00:07:44,837
this is disappointing to me, willpower is a finite resource.

164
00:07:44,937 --> 00:07:47,560
I wish I could say that, like, you can do it, power through it.

165
00:07:48,221 --> 00:07:52,306
Scientists in 1998 did a groundbreaking experiment

166
00:07:53,287 --> 00:07:56,691
with hot chocolate chip cookies and math problems.

167
00:07:58,336 --> 00:08:02,720
And they pretty much found that by the end of all of these math problems,

168
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:08,305
wasted these people's self-restraint to the point where they had to have the cookies.

169
00:08:08,325 --> 00:08:10,086
And that's when they sort of cheated on the experiment,

170
00:08:10,367 --> 00:08:13,109
was when they just did too much of the math and they couldn't take it anymore.

171
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:16,072
And that's why statistically, most people cheat on their diets and

172
00:08:16,112 --> 00:08:17,172
their spouses after work.

173
00:08:17,693 --> 00:08:18,153
Make a little sense?

174
00:08:21,226 --> 00:08:25,629
So the more mental space that's getting crowded in your brain

175
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:28,591
is draining your actual willpower.

176
00:08:28,871 --> 00:08:31,553
And two people who are very famous who

177
00:08:31,573 --> 00:08:34,455
took advantage of this are Steve Jobs and Barack Obama.

178
00:08:34,755 --> 00:08:35,816
And they did it with their clothing.

179
00:08:36,396 --> 00:08:37,396
Steve Jobs had a uniform.

180
00:08:37,436 --> 00:08:38,617
He wore a black turtleneck and black,

181
00:08:38,637 --> 00:08:40,317
that was like what he wore.

182
00:08:40,678 --> 00:08:42,418
So that it was never on his plate.

183
00:08:42,618 --> 00:08:44,019
He never had to think about what he was wearing.

184
00:08:44,359 --> 00:08:45,679
Barack Obama, when he was in office,

185
00:08:45,699 --> 00:08:47,860
never picked out a single suit.

186
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,981
Somebody did it for him, took it off his plate.

187
00:08:50,301 --> 00:08:51,882
So one of the strategies we're gonna talk about

188
00:08:52,222 --> 00:08:53,982
is automating things in your life.

189
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:55,343
Getting them off your plate

190
00:08:55,423 --> 00:08:57,764
so it takes none of your head space.

191
00:08:58,224 --> 00:08:59,845
And that's why they talk about

192
00:08:59,865 --> 00:09:01,325
the power of rituals in this book.

193
00:09:01,725 --> 00:09:04,226
So they say that 95% of what we do

194
00:09:04,346 --> 00:09:07,908
occurs automatically or as a response to anxiety.

195
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:11,209
So if we can automate the good things in our life,

196
00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:13,030
it takes it out of our mental space.

197
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:16,331
So willpower is a drain on you,

198
00:09:16,711 --> 00:09:19,472
but a ritual, something that you sort of craft

199
00:09:19,552 --> 00:09:22,494
and do time and again, takes 20 days to form a habit,

200
00:09:22,914 --> 00:09:25,155
40 days to make it like a lifelong permanent habit.

201
00:09:25,575 --> 00:09:27,256
Those are things that you can do

202
00:09:27,836 --> 00:09:29,316
to take things off your plate.

203
00:09:29,716 --> 00:09:31,417
Brushing your teeth, for example, that's a pull.

204
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:34,580
You hate the way it feels when you don't brush your teeth, right?

205
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,161
But you don't think about it.

206
00:09:36,401 --> 00:09:37,582
It's not a question like,

207
00:09:37,602 --> 00:09:39,164
Am I going to brush my teeth today?

208
00:09:39,364 --> 00:09:42,606
Your co-workers won't appreciate if you're asking yourself that question, by the way.

209
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:49,551
So we're going to move on to the next strategy, which is habit three.

210
00:09:50,432 --> 00:09:52,912
I'm not going to teach you all seven habits of highly effective people.

211
00:09:52,932 --> 00:09:54,473
We're just going to talk about habit three.

212
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:58,854
So Stephen Covey pretty much wrote the primer on personal development

213
00:09:58,894 --> 00:10:01,815
when he wrote the seven habits of highly effective people.

214
00:10:02,756 --> 00:10:07,097
What habit three is about is being able to identify where a task falls

215
00:10:07,817 --> 00:10:09,198
in priority of importance.

216
00:10:10,398 --> 00:10:11,278
So when you go into work.

217
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:13,553
Look at what you have to do.

218
00:10:14,393 --> 00:10:16,755
Mentally put it in a different category.

219
00:10:16,915 --> 00:10:20,537
Now, most people would say, especially in games,

220
00:10:20,878 --> 00:10:22,739
quadrant one is the most important, right?

221
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:25,020
Because it's urgent and important.

222
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,222
Covey disagrees.

223
00:10:29,023 --> 00:10:31,004
Covey thinks that the most important quadrant

224
00:10:31,905 --> 00:10:32,645
is quadrant two.

225
00:10:33,863 --> 00:10:37,067
That is where you're getting prep for peak flow.

226
00:10:37,167 --> 00:10:38,188
We talked about that before.

227
00:10:38,488 --> 00:10:39,970
Quadrant two is planning.

228
00:10:40,411 --> 00:10:42,353
Quadrant two is relationship building.

229
00:10:42,673 --> 00:10:45,757
Quadrant two is getting ready to get ready to get ready.

230
00:10:46,378 --> 00:10:46,678
Okay?

231
00:10:47,038 --> 00:10:48,780
Quadrant one is fighting fires.

232
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:50,763
And listen, in game development,

233
00:10:51,063 --> 00:10:52,605
we are fighting fires all the time.

234
00:10:52,905 --> 00:10:54,147
you know, a game breaking bug,

235
00:10:54,207 --> 00:10:55,408
something comes down the pipeline

236
00:10:55,428 --> 00:10:57,130
and ends up at you that you didn't plan on.

237
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,774
However, if you spend enough time in quadrant two

238
00:11:01,195 --> 00:11:02,576
doing that nice prep,

239
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:05,499
you will have the tools and sort of the attitude

240
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:08,122
to fight those fires, fight them efficiently,

241
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:10,545
move on and not have to do as many

242
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:12,427
of the quadrant one things.

243
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:18,337
Let's talk for a moment about quadrant three, which I call delegate, he calls it distraction.

244
00:11:18,797 --> 00:11:23,485
If something is urgent, that means it has to be done now. But if it's not important,

245
00:11:23,786 --> 00:11:27,291
and it doesn't align with your goals, do you really need to do it?

246
00:11:28,227 --> 00:11:33,212
Outsource if you can I say if you're looking at your list and you've got a lot of quadrant threes

247
00:11:33,332 --> 00:11:37,536
I'm gonna say see who you can outsource them to or just say no. No is a complete sentence

248
00:11:38,357 --> 00:11:40,539
I don't necessarily mean that always in the job sense

249
00:11:40,819 --> 00:11:43,182
But if somebody's coming to you be like, hey, can you be on this?

250
00:11:43,362 --> 00:11:48,427
You know PTO thing like I'm sorry, you know, I just have to say no I would say quadrant three

251
00:11:49,415 --> 00:11:52,596
delegate or try to shift around a little.

252
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:55,237
Quadrant four, I'm just gonna call it social media.

253
00:11:55,717 --> 00:11:56,097
Don't do it.

254
00:11:56,597 --> 00:11:57,857
Close your tabs, okay?

255
00:11:58,657 --> 00:12:02,958
I do take one thing here that I disagree with Covey,

256
00:12:03,738 --> 00:12:04,699
pleasant activities.

257
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:05,759
I think those are a two.

258
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:09,660
I think they're a two because you need to feel rewarded

259
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:10,980
and happy on a personal level.

260
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,540
So let's put fun in quadrant one.

261
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,481
I think that that's, I'm sorry, quadrant two.

262
00:12:16,787 --> 00:12:18,028
I wanted a rhyme, it just didn't work.

263
00:12:18,528 --> 00:12:21,249
So the next one is Deepak Chopra.

264
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:22,770
So I love Deepak Chopra.

265
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,471
If you saw my GDC talk last year,

266
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:26,432
he does this amazing, amazing, amazing talk.

267
00:12:27,312 --> 00:12:29,553
No, I did a talk on his amazing app

268
00:12:30,854 --> 00:12:32,995
called Ananda for meditation.

269
00:12:34,135 --> 00:12:36,596
And I know that this seems maybe a little bit more esoteric,

270
00:12:36,636 --> 00:12:37,537
but bear with me.

271
00:12:39,077 --> 00:12:43,021
Deepak says that time sickness is the epidemic of our generation.

272
00:12:43,361 --> 00:12:47,425
We always feel like time is running out and time is the enemy, more importantly.

273
00:12:47,765 --> 00:12:50,427
So that most people deal with this in an external approach.

274
00:12:50,968 --> 00:12:54,170
Time acts on us and we must defeat it, right?

275
00:12:54,951 --> 00:12:58,915
Deepak offers an internal approach which is a little bit different.

276
00:12:59,395 --> 00:13:02,438
He basically says, stop measuring your day by the clock altogether.

277
00:13:02,878 --> 00:13:04,920
Now when you're in crunch, you might be scratching your head being like,

278
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,801
ah, interesting theory, no.

279
00:13:08,762 --> 00:13:14,363
But if you can change your belief that time is running short and live in the present moment,

280
00:13:15,243 --> 00:13:19,084
things change. And that is because time is psychologically colored.

281
00:13:19,344 --> 00:13:25,525
Let's take an hour, for example, an hour. An hour catching up with a friend.

282
00:13:26,445 --> 00:13:28,665
Right? We've done a lot of that here in the green, right?

283
00:13:29,065 --> 00:13:33,086
It passes like this. Take that same hour.

284
00:13:33,606 --> 00:13:36,407
Put yourself in a dentist's chair and the anesthesia is not working.

285
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,202
that is interminable, right?

286
00:13:40,542 --> 00:13:44,185
So an hour, time is kind of wibbly wobbly, people.

287
00:13:44,205 --> 00:13:45,526
You know?

288
00:13:46,147 --> 00:13:46,707
You know how I feel.

289
00:13:46,747 --> 00:13:47,628
Time is a flat circle.

290
00:13:47,888 --> 00:13:49,689
So I feel like you can sort of.

291
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,190
Get into that peak flow.

292
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:54,692
When you get into peak flow, time disappears.

293
00:13:55,093 --> 00:13:57,134
How many of you can agree with that?

294
00:13:57,174 --> 00:13:59,116
Like when you really get in the zone, wow.

295
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:02,518
You don't know if 10 minutes or five hours have passed.

296
00:14:02,898 --> 00:14:04,079
That's the good stuff.

297
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,380
That's the sweet spot.

298
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,302
Time doesn't matter because you are getting after it.

299
00:14:08,743 --> 00:14:11,024
And I love getting into peak flow.

300
00:14:11,565 --> 00:14:12,886
Deepak also advocates for.

301
00:14:13,766 --> 00:14:16,648
meditation to help you sort of expand your brain space.

302
00:14:16,688 --> 00:14:18,809
Last year I talked about how 80% of the time

303
00:14:18,869 --> 00:14:20,790
we're either in the past in our heads

304
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:21,931
or in the future in our heads

305
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:24,632
and we're only in the present moment for 20% of our day.

306
00:14:25,093 --> 00:14:27,254
Meditation can help you widen that, okay.

307
00:14:28,752 --> 00:14:29,814
Let's move on.

308
00:14:30,815 --> 00:14:32,077
RPM by Tony Robbins.

309
00:14:32,097 --> 00:14:34,200
I know a lot of you are familiar with Tony Robbins.

310
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,722
He's like, isn't he that big goofy guy?

311
00:14:36,544 --> 00:14:38,827
Watch on Netflix, I Am Not Your Guru,

312
00:14:38,887 --> 00:14:39,969
and you will love the man.

313
00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:40,670
He's incredible.

314
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:44,956
But he's really a world-class time management speaker.

315
00:14:45,436 --> 00:14:48,617
And he has this RPM method, which stands for results-oriented,

316
00:14:48,957 --> 00:14:50,717
purpose-driven, I know it sounds so corporate,

317
00:14:51,258 --> 00:14:52,458
massive action plan.

318
00:14:52,778 --> 00:14:55,058
But it's amazing, because traditional to-do lists

319
00:14:55,179 --> 00:14:56,199
are hot garbage.

320
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:58,939
They are erased to the bottom, and there is no bottom.

321
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,280
Because when you get to, like, the end of that to-do list,

322
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:04,181
and then you wake up the next morning, he got another one.

323
00:15:04,401 --> 00:15:05,781
And stuff always keeps getting bumped.

324
00:15:06,081 --> 00:15:07,962
And most of the stuff you do on your to-do list

325
00:15:08,422 --> 00:15:10,622
doesn't go toward your actual goals.

326
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:12,343
It's just minutiae, right?

327
00:15:12,763 --> 00:15:13,783
So with RPM.

328
00:15:14,464 --> 00:15:17,426
He basically has you focus on outcomes, okay?

329
00:15:18,246 --> 00:15:21,529
And I did a sample one for something I did on perception.

330
00:15:21,569 --> 00:15:24,531
So, in perception, I really thought

331
00:15:24,551 --> 00:15:26,753
that nailing chapter two was critical

332
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:28,814
from an emotional standpoint, okay?

333
00:15:29,615 --> 00:15:31,376
Why did I think that that was important?

334
00:15:31,777 --> 00:15:34,459
Because I wanted the players, they had to like Betty,

335
00:15:34,499 --> 00:15:36,020
they had to buy into Betty's story

336
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,581
to really get the full impact.

337
00:15:38,061 --> 00:15:39,582
So I was thinking about my why.

338
00:15:39,943 --> 00:15:42,445
Simon Sinek does a great talk about why,

339
00:15:42,725 --> 00:15:43,686
and I think that everybody should.

340
00:15:44,466 --> 00:15:45,567
look that up at some point.

341
00:15:46,448 --> 00:15:49,050
And then my massive action was I did a beat sheet.

342
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,993
So if anybody is a writer and has never read Blake Snyder's Save the Cat,

343
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:54,094
do it now.

344
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:58,177
It basically can outline any chapter, any full story arc.

345
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:01,520
So I did out the beats, and then I went through,

346
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:05,303
and I thought about how the player would feel during that beat,

347
00:16:05,823 --> 00:16:07,364
and then I filled it in and actually wrote it.

348
00:16:07,644 --> 00:16:10,166
The last thing I did was I paid special mind to my wording

349
00:16:10,207 --> 00:16:11,988
because it was taking place in the 1940s,

350
00:16:12,048 --> 00:16:13,409
and I wanted it to sound authentic.

351
00:16:13,509 --> 00:16:14,910
So that's a sample RPM.

352
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:16,530
Very goal oriented.

353
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,791
When I came out of it, I had a chapter two script

354
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:19,811
that was engaging.

355
00:16:21,512 --> 00:16:22,732
Sample RPM for life,

356
00:16:22,752 --> 00:16:24,733
because this is life work balance, is it not?

357
00:16:25,994 --> 00:16:26,334
Results.

358
00:16:26,394 --> 00:16:29,195
I want to feel fit, rested, and energetic.

359
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:30,255
Why?

360
00:16:31,465 --> 00:16:34,827
because I need to take as much off my plate as I can.

361
00:16:34,907 --> 00:16:38,128
People, if I am feeling tired, sore, or hangry,

362
00:16:38,449 --> 00:16:40,089
it's going to take me out of the zone.

363
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:41,850
It's going to take me out of peak flow.

364
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:44,411
I want to get as much off my plate as I can.

365
00:16:44,912 --> 00:16:48,133
And that's why it is critical for me to do meal prep.

366
00:16:49,163 --> 00:16:52,285
Take an hour on a Sunday, line up five mason jars,

367
00:16:52,686 --> 00:16:55,748
put in some chia seeds, oats, plant milk and berries,

368
00:16:55,788 --> 00:16:56,388
put them in the fridge.

369
00:16:56,428 --> 00:16:58,450
You have breakfast every single day

370
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:00,091
without having to blink an eye.

371
00:17:00,131 --> 00:17:01,052
You have to heat coffee.

372
00:17:01,292 --> 00:17:02,433
Dude, you just pull this out of the fridge

373
00:17:02,473 --> 00:17:03,734
and just sit there and start to wake up.

374
00:17:04,154 --> 00:17:05,335
It takes it off your plate.

375
00:17:06,406 --> 00:17:07,526
I mean, not like a literal plate.

376
00:17:07,746 --> 00:17:09,527
It takes it off your plate mentally.

377
00:17:09,547 --> 00:17:12,867
I always do yoga or meditate before work.

378
00:17:13,067 --> 00:17:15,668
I always keep my desk stocked with things

379
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:17,828
that keep me in the zone, keep me happy.

380
00:17:17,888 --> 00:17:20,609
I use like peppermint oil and wild orange oil

381
00:17:20,629 --> 00:17:21,669
to sort of wakey wakey.

382
00:17:22,029 --> 00:17:22,930
Lots of supplements.

383
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:24,350
Just be ready.

384
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,150
If you're prepared, if you take time

385
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,771
to just have a work environment that's easy and natural

386
00:17:29,851 --> 00:17:32,172
and lets you get into the flow, that's critical.

387
00:17:33,267 --> 00:17:35,648
Next, Tony Robbins talks about chunking,

388
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:36,769
which is basically saying that

389
00:17:37,629 --> 00:17:39,571
we get overwhelmed by our lives.

390
00:17:39,671 --> 00:17:40,811
Oh my God, I have so much to do.

391
00:17:40,831 --> 00:17:42,132
I have this, this, this, this, this, this, this.

392
00:17:42,612 --> 00:17:44,634
Tony Robbins says that if you can sort of mentally

393
00:17:44,674 --> 00:17:46,295
come up with a chest of drawers

394
00:17:46,715 --> 00:17:48,216
and you know that everything in your life

395
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:49,957
goes into one of those drawers,

396
00:17:50,577 --> 00:17:51,938
you feel a little bit better.

397
00:17:52,378 --> 00:17:53,859
Like, oh, OK, that's just something

398
00:17:53,879 --> 00:17:54,779
I got to do for the kids.

399
00:17:54,939 --> 00:17:55,919
Put it away in that drawer.

400
00:17:55,959 --> 00:17:58,160
So this is just my set of drawers.

401
00:17:59,121 --> 00:18:00,161
Everybody has their own.

402
00:18:00,561 --> 00:18:02,182
But if you can sort of categorize

403
00:18:02,202 --> 00:18:04,883
the problems in your life, it makes things much easier.

404
00:18:04,903 --> 00:18:06,644
Not problems, but things to do.

405
00:18:08,044 --> 00:18:09,965
The Desire Map by Daniel Alport.

406
00:18:10,605 --> 00:18:12,926
It's a whole book, but it's really just one question.

407
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:15,007
How do you want to feel?

408
00:18:15,917 --> 00:18:17,298
That's it. How do you want to feel?

409
00:18:17,838 --> 00:18:20,438
So it's a revolutionary approach to goal setting.

410
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:21,018
Okay.

411
00:18:21,719 --> 00:18:23,999
Danielle LaPorte, if somebody said,

412
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:26,200
okay, my goal is to have three ship titles by 30,

413
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,340
Danielle LaPorte would ask you,

414
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,781
okay, well, how would that make you feel

415
00:18:30,821 --> 00:18:31,981
if you had three ship titles by 30?

416
00:18:33,282 --> 00:18:35,462
Okay. Would it make you feel prolific?

417
00:18:35,742 --> 00:18:37,323
Would it make you feel like a professional?

418
00:18:37,543 --> 00:18:38,903
Would it make you feel accomplished?

419
00:18:38,923 --> 00:18:40,083
Would it make you feel like an adult?

420
00:18:40,939 --> 00:18:42,439
Now reverse engineer some goals.

421
00:18:42,499 --> 00:18:44,320
Do you really need three ship titles by 30?

422
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,482
It sort of makes it seem kind of arbitrary.

423
00:18:47,742 --> 00:18:49,523
So when you think about how you want to feel,

424
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:52,664
and then reverse engineer some goals from that,

425
00:18:52,944 --> 00:18:55,105
you can really free up a lot of time in your life.

426
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:57,907
Like, wow, I actually don't need to do that to feel fulfilled.

427
00:18:57,947 --> 00:18:58,467
Isn't that funny?

428
00:18:58,767 --> 00:19:00,228
It can kind of change a lot for you.

429
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:04,510
Moving on to The Slight Edge.

430
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:06,971
This book changed everything for me.

431
00:19:08,621 --> 00:19:11,183
It's the fact that every life decision you make

432
00:19:11,863 --> 00:19:13,725
can make your life go up or down.

433
00:19:14,105 --> 00:19:15,806
There's a Japanese word for it, kaizen.

434
00:19:16,187 --> 00:19:18,108
It is the aggregation of marginal gains.

435
00:19:18,468 --> 00:19:21,170
We all know how exponential growth looks, right?

436
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:22,852
We've all seen that curve.

437
00:19:23,932 --> 00:19:24,493
Essentially.

438
00:19:25,755 --> 00:19:26,676
Everything you do matters.

439
00:19:26,996 --> 00:19:28,497
And that's kind of intimidating, right?

440
00:19:28,817 --> 00:19:30,758
But if you can sort of automate yourself

441
00:19:30,818 --> 00:19:32,298
to know that you're making a decision

442
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:33,639
that's either gonna go up or down,

443
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:34,619
it makes a lot of sense.

444
00:19:34,639 --> 00:19:35,700
Let me show you the next slide

445
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,100
that has a little bit of a chart.

446
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,742
Okay, so for a long time, it stays stable.

447
00:19:41,162 --> 00:19:42,102
Imagine in your 20s,

448
00:19:42,142 --> 00:19:43,863
you might be making some poor food choices,

449
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:45,604
you might be making some poor money choices.

450
00:19:45,644 --> 00:19:47,084
It kind of doesn't really affect you until,

451
00:19:47,365 --> 00:19:48,945
oh my God, you knew it.

452
00:19:50,427 --> 00:19:53,589
40. I'm hitting 40 this year and hopefully I'm going up not down. But you

453
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:57,752
know what I mean. It doesn't necessarily mean 40. But what it says here on this

454
00:19:57,812 --> 00:20:01,554
slide, and I'm not sure if you can see it, is what's uncomfortable early becomes

455
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:04,996
comfortable later. Think about going to the gym every day. If that first week

456
00:20:05,016 --> 00:20:08,138
you're like, oh my god, why am I doing this? And then two months in you're like, I can't

457
00:20:08,158 --> 00:20:09,399
imagine not doing this.

458
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:16,304
Same goes for the bottom that says what's uncomfortable early becomes uncomfortable later.

459
00:20:16,344 --> 00:20:18,905
Like, yeah, that's fine, midnight snacks, no worry.

460
00:20:19,186 --> 00:20:21,687
All of a sudden, you just don't feel good anymore.

461
00:20:22,308 --> 00:20:24,329
So I love this idea.

462
00:20:26,505 --> 00:20:30,149
Slight changes equal big eventual payoff.

463
00:20:30,769 --> 00:20:32,451
The payoff does not happen in a week.

464
00:20:32,951 --> 00:20:34,112
I've seen a meme out there that's like,

465
00:20:34,152 --> 00:20:36,234
I started a diet today, how many pounds did I lose?

466
00:20:36,274 --> 00:20:36,794
That kind of thing.

467
00:20:37,075 --> 00:20:39,157
This is a long game, okay?

468
00:20:39,457 --> 00:20:41,419
And these are the kind of choices that...

469
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:45,483
Jeff Olson suggests you think about on a daily basis.

470
00:20:45,863 --> 00:20:48,166
These are the kind of things that if you intuitively know

471
00:20:48,186 --> 00:20:51,249
that you're making a good choice or an uptick, you're good.

472
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:54,433
You kind of also know when you're making a downtick choice.

473
00:20:54,873 --> 00:20:55,154
Okay?

474
00:20:55,514 --> 00:20:57,216
And like I said, it's the long game.

475
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,518
So if you make a few downticks, no worry.

476
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:00,980
But it's a trend,

477
00:21:01,401 --> 00:21:03,383
and it's eventually going to have a giant payoff.

478
00:21:05,562 --> 00:21:10,867
I actually, for my payoff, I don't have caffeine anymore.

479
00:21:11,527 --> 00:21:16,192
I have four kids, several jobs, and I don't need caffeine.

480
00:21:16,592 --> 00:21:19,094
I've changed so much about my health, nutrition,

481
00:21:19,435 --> 00:21:23,358
awareness, and sleep, that my body is like a battery itself.

482
00:21:23,438 --> 00:21:25,620
I don't need that artificial caffeine

483
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,162
because I've made so many choices,

484
00:21:27,182 --> 00:21:28,463
but it took a long time, you know?

485
00:21:28,483 --> 00:21:30,965
It took about two years, and now I'm like, woo, I'm good.

486
00:21:32,463 --> 00:21:36,405
Anyway, the last piece of advice has to do with my juicer.

487
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:39,846
Kind of a weird thing, but that's a beautiful

488
00:21:39,906 --> 00:21:42,027
Williams-Sonoma citrus juicer.

489
00:21:42,387 --> 00:21:44,348
I use tons and tons and tons of lemons.

490
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:46,648
So I'll give you a little background.

491
00:21:47,089 --> 00:21:48,709
I used to watch this show called Good Eats

492
00:21:48,769 --> 00:21:50,790
on Food Network with Alton Brown, so good.

493
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:54,491
He used to say, never buy a uni-tasker for your kitchen,

494
00:21:54,571 --> 00:21:56,332
and that's something that only does one thing,

495
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,212
like a garlic press.

496
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,833
You will never need to do anything with that

497
00:21:58,993 --> 00:21:59,933
except for pressed garlic.

498
00:22:00,893 --> 00:22:04,134
But I adopted that sort of for my entire lifestyle.

499
00:22:04,174 --> 00:22:05,875
I was like, I'm going to multitask everything.

500
00:22:05,935 --> 00:22:07,075
I'm the mom who can do it all.

501
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:10,656
And no, you shouldn't multitask.

502
00:22:11,136 --> 00:22:13,557
Because it's been proven time and again

503
00:22:13,597 --> 00:22:16,818
that the results of what you produce when you're multitasking

504
00:22:17,198 --> 00:22:20,479
are so much worse than if you just sat down and did it

505
00:22:20,579 --> 00:22:21,199
and did it right.

506
00:22:21,459 --> 00:22:23,640
You spend more time correcting yourself

507
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,701
after multitasking than you would

508
00:22:26,741 --> 00:22:28,982
have if you just sat down and did it out with nothing else.

509
00:22:29,342 --> 00:22:30,964
And so the juicer comes into play here.

510
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:33,426
Because I just didn't want to buy a UniTasker.

511
00:22:33,446 --> 00:22:34,427
I was squeezing my own lemons.

512
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:36,550
And then finally, I just love the design of this.

513
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,090
It was so pretty.

514
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,011
I'm like, I'm just going to do it.

515
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:38,612
I bought it.

516
00:22:38,932 --> 00:22:39,813
I squeezed my lemon.

517
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:41,615
I was like, oh my god, 10 times the juice came out.

518
00:22:42,036 --> 00:22:42,897
That was so worth it.

519
00:22:43,377 --> 00:22:46,020
And it's kind of a metaphor for time management.

520
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,883
Like, if you really get it down, you'll get 10 times the juice.

521
00:22:49,184 --> 00:22:49,384
Right?

522
00:22:49,524 --> 00:22:50,185
It's such a good thing.

523
00:22:51,586 --> 00:22:53,606
Next one is growth as a human need.

524
00:22:53,966 --> 00:22:55,507
One of the things that Tony Robbins talks about

525
00:22:55,887 --> 00:22:59,547
is that from a personal level, if we're not growing,

526
00:23:00,368 --> 00:23:02,108
it makes us unhappy as humans.

527
00:23:02,488 --> 00:23:06,269
So if you can sort of make sure that your schedule

528
00:23:06,429 --> 00:23:08,749
builds in time for you to be passionate,

529
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:10,369
and if your job's not doing it,

530
00:23:11,029 --> 00:23:13,470
just carve out like a half hour a day to read up

531
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:15,230
or to take up a hobby,

532
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:18,691
because if we don't feel like we're growing, we're dying.

533
00:23:20,746 --> 00:23:22,027
Act as if is a common thing.

534
00:23:22,607 --> 00:23:24,468
If you feel like you're in crunch

535
00:23:24,948 --> 00:23:26,309
and you're not handling things,

536
00:23:26,629 --> 00:23:28,430
if you start to act like you're handling things,

537
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:31,931
it's been shown that you actually start to be able to do it.

538
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:34,112
So I know I don't have enough time

539
00:23:34,152 --> 00:23:35,393
to do an entire session on that,

540
00:23:35,433 --> 00:23:37,794
but I feel like my next talk is gonna be about act as if.

541
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:38,914
It's actually really fascinating.

542
00:23:39,515 --> 00:23:40,675
Lastly, close your tabs.

543
00:23:42,151 --> 00:23:43,392
at work and in life.

544
00:23:44,233 --> 00:23:47,335
I really feel like too often we are so scattered.

545
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:50,017
We're on our phones, we're walking across the street

546
00:23:50,097 --> 00:23:51,338
on our phones and talking to people.

547
00:23:51,738 --> 00:23:55,861
If you take more time to do what you really want

548
00:23:56,482 --> 00:24:00,105
and to feel better and to do what you're at work to do,

549
00:24:00,665 --> 00:24:02,767
then things are gonna be a lot easier for you.

550
00:24:04,348 --> 00:24:08,551
So I am going to, I'm right at about five minutes left,

551
00:24:08,611 --> 00:24:10,052
which is great, so let me just give you

552
00:24:10,112 --> 00:24:11,333
my contact information.

553
00:24:11,353 --> 00:24:13,574
So, Amanda at thedeependgames.com.

554
00:24:13,714 --> 00:24:16,776
If you have any ideas of what's worked for you,

555
00:24:16,836 --> 00:24:17,497
I would love to hear it.

556
00:24:17,577 --> 00:24:19,318
If you implement any of these ideas

557
00:24:19,378 --> 00:24:20,499
or read any of these books,

558
00:24:20,579 --> 00:24:22,280
I would love, love, love to hear that.

559
00:24:23,181 --> 00:24:26,883
Or if you need a crunch coach, hit me up, I'm a girl.

560
00:24:27,564 --> 00:24:29,605
I'm also on Twitter at Amanda S. Gardner.

561
00:24:29,625 --> 00:24:32,587
And yeah, I can take questions.

562
00:24:32,627 --> 00:24:33,628
I've got five minutes.

563
00:24:34,508 --> 00:24:35,508
See, I managed the time.

564
00:24:35,608 --> 00:24:36,008
Hey!

565
00:24:42,591 --> 00:24:44,492
Questions or things that have worked for you.

566
00:24:44,772 --> 00:24:46,713
I'm happy to hear from some of you.

567
00:24:46,733 --> 00:24:48,014
So anybody have anything to say?

568
00:24:49,354 --> 00:24:49,534
Yes?

569
00:24:52,055 --> 00:24:53,696
Shout it and I will reiterate.

570
00:25:05,426 --> 00:25:07,608
I would say put yourself above everything

571
00:25:07,788 --> 00:25:10,190
except for your immediate family.

572
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:12,071
When I got sick, I put my health,

573
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:14,233
oh, I'm so sorry, he said, what do you put first?

574
00:25:14,934 --> 00:25:16,915
If you have to prioritize, and I say your own health.

575
00:25:18,056 --> 00:25:20,138
because if you, like I said,

576
00:25:20,198 --> 00:25:21,699
it takes everything off your plate

577
00:25:21,739 --> 00:25:23,860
if you're not achy, tired, and hungry,

578
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:26,902
and have a million things physically going on.

579
00:25:27,042 --> 00:25:28,823
I used to have chronic anxiety disorder.

580
00:25:29,064 --> 00:25:30,645
I don't have any anxiety anymore

581
00:25:30,685 --> 00:25:32,346
because I've planned everything.

582
00:25:32,766 --> 00:25:34,447
I've done a lot of meditation.

583
00:25:34,467 --> 00:25:36,729
I've read a lot.

584
00:25:36,749 --> 00:25:37,489
I've gone to therapy.

585
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:38,810
Like, you have to,

586
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:40,871
it's like when the airbag in the plane comes down.

587
00:25:41,899 --> 00:25:44,761
You put it on before you put it on anybody else, okay?

588
00:25:45,121 --> 00:25:46,682
And I know that that's a cheesy metaphor,

589
00:25:46,982 --> 00:25:50,165
but if you're not well, you're not taking care of your job,

590
00:25:50,365 --> 00:25:51,565
you're not taking care of your family,

591
00:25:51,585 --> 00:25:52,926
you're not taking care of anything.

592
00:25:52,946 --> 00:25:54,267
You have to put yourself first,

593
00:25:54,307 --> 00:25:55,728
and I'm super adamant about that.

594
00:25:55,748 --> 00:25:55,808
Yes?

595
00:25:55,828 --> 00:25:59,410
Hi, so a lot of the strategies you talked about

596
00:25:59,431 --> 00:26:02,432
were for the individual, but in games especially,

597
00:26:02,452 --> 00:26:03,013
we work in team environments.

598
00:26:03,033 --> 00:26:03,093
Yes.

599
00:26:03,113 --> 00:26:05,915
What are different ways that you've talked,

600
00:26:05,935 --> 00:26:08,576
been able to implement these kind of strategies

601
00:26:08,857 --> 00:26:10,538
within the team?

602
00:26:15,896 --> 00:26:16,617
I love that idea.

603
00:26:16,697 --> 00:26:18,979
So she asked about how do you implement this with your team?

604
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,743
So my situation is I make games in my basement

605
00:26:22,763 --> 00:26:25,125
with my husband, which is very different

606
00:26:25,265 --> 00:26:26,647
and also, ooh, it's getting loud,

607
00:26:26,907 --> 00:26:28,288
and also slightly contentious.

608
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:32,593
So I have actually sort of changed his diet.

609
00:26:33,614 --> 00:26:39,037
as well. And I've changed a lot of the things for our household. But we use contractors

610
00:26:39,077 --> 00:26:45,661
in our studio because we're super indie. But I think that I cut a lot of the fat. I keep

611
00:26:45,721 --> 00:26:51,005
things really tight and not in a terse way, but in a very, this is what's happening kind

612
00:26:51,045 --> 00:26:53,966
of way. We don't have like a water cooler at work. I mean.

613
00:26:54,287 --> 00:26:57,089
We have when we go off to soccer and the minivan kind of thing.

614
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,531
I try to keep everything as distinct as I can.

615
00:26:59,791 --> 00:27:02,173
And I do like to share my strategies with my husband.

616
00:27:02,233 --> 00:27:04,434
And if my contractor, the contractors ever

617
00:27:04,515 --> 00:27:06,336
want some of this stuff, I'm happy to give it.

618
00:27:06,536 --> 00:27:07,717
But we have a remote office situation.

619
00:27:07,737 --> 00:27:08,738
So I wish I had more to say about that.

620
00:27:08,758 --> 00:27:08,958
So sorry.

621
00:27:08,978 --> 00:27:09,038
Yes.

622
00:27:09,058 --> 00:27:10,399
Well, I guess my question is, have you

623
00:27:10,419 --> 00:27:11,620
really started sticking to the habits that will help you

624
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:20,827
in this sort of thing when you're going home?

625
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:20,907
Yes.

626
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:26,592
Okay, I'm so glad she asked that.

627
00:27:26,612 --> 00:27:28,434
She said, how do you actually stick to these habits?

628
00:27:29,255 --> 00:27:31,017
Commit to 20 days.

629
00:27:32,218 --> 00:27:33,400
20 days, write that down.

630
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,422
20 days will be a habit for anything.

631
00:27:35,722 --> 00:27:37,625
So if you can sort of put it in your calendar,

632
00:27:38,005 --> 00:27:39,707
make yourself do these things just for 20 days,

633
00:27:39,727 --> 00:27:41,429
because anybody can do anything for 20 days.

634
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:46,153
By then it will become automated and integrated in your day.

635
00:27:46,433 --> 00:27:47,974
And you mentioned the end of your day.

636
00:27:48,535 --> 00:27:52,097
I don't know if you're a night owl or like a lark.

637
00:27:52,297 --> 00:27:54,019
They call them larks when you love to wake up early.

638
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:55,660
Maybe wake up a little bit earlier.

639
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,461
Maybe start to do stuff at the beginning of the day.

640
00:27:57,521 --> 00:27:58,182
I don't know.

641
00:27:58,302 --> 00:27:59,302
Everybody knows their own body,

642
00:27:59,563 --> 00:28:01,024
but I also have to say listen to your body

643
00:28:01,044 --> 00:28:02,345
because if it's telling you to go to sleep,

644
00:28:02,545 --> 00:28:03,205
there's a reason.

645
00:28:03,466 --> 00:28:06,408
And I'm huge into that whole take what you need.

646
00:28:07,669 --> 00:28:09,770
Sleep, if it's medication, if it's meditation,

647
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:12,091
take whatever your body needs and your mind needs.

648
00:28:13,052 --> 00:28:15,294
So if you go home at night and you need to crash,

649
00:28:15,414 --> 00:28:17,675
that's good, that's you listening to your body.

650
00:28:17,895 --> 00:28:19,997
So other than that, 20 days,

651
00:28:20,377 --> 00:28:22,038
try something different if you want.

652
00:28:22,658 --> 00:28:23,299
Any other questions?

653
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:24,279
We have time for one more, yes.

654
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:24,920
How much do you sleep?

655
00:28:27,261 --> 00:28:27,662
Eight hours.

656
00:28:28,302 --> 00:28:29,723
I make that a non-negotiable.

657
00:28:29,743 --> 00:28:30,443
Thank you.

658
00:28:30,463 --> 00:28:31,164
Thank you.

659
00:28:31,204 --> 00:28:31,444
Thank you.

660
00:28:31,464 --> 00:28:31,724
Thank you.

661
00:28:31,744 --> 00:28:32,044
Thank you.

662
00:28:32,064 --> 00:28:32,345
Thank you.

663
00:28:32,385 --> 00:28:33,085
Thank you.

664
00:28:33,145 --> 00:28:33,385
Thank you.

665
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:37,101
I mean, like, if I have a kid wake up in the middle of the night, you know.

666
00:28:37,361 --> 00:28:41,423
But yeah, no, I absolutely make certain that I do that because I cannot.

667
00:28:42,063 --> 00:28:44,845
My husband, he doesn't need nearly as much sleep as I do, but that's his body.

668
00:28:44,885 --> 00:28:45,365
This is mine.

669
00:28:45,645 --> 00:28:47,166
So yeah, great question.

670
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:50,228
One more, because we have one minute.

671
00:28:51,848 --> 00:28:52,209
Anybody?

672
00:28:52,449 --> 00:28:53,449
See, time management.

673
00:28:53,509 --> 00:28:54,490
Everything's time management.

674
00:28:56,111 --> 00:28:56,271
No?

675
00:28:56,851 --> 00:28:56,971
OK.

676
00:28:57,431 --> 00:28:57,571
Yes.

677
00:29:00,101 --> 00:29:06,866
I found that by setting aside 10 minutes a day, I'll set a timer for 10 minutes and sketch

678
00:29:06,886 --> 00:29:07,326
for 10 minutes.

679
00:29:07,406 --> 00:29:10,748
As soon as the timer's up, I stop the drawing.

680
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:22,491
I love that.

681
00:29:22,551 --> 00:29:23,411
So if you couldn't hear him,

682
00:29:23,431 --> 00:29:25,993
he said that he will set a timer to draw for 10 minutes.

683
00:29:26,634 --> 00:29:28,535
I think that doing that is perfect.

684
00:29:28,635 --> 00:29:31,237
As a writer, I love to do like flash fiction,

685
00:29:31,277 --> 00:29:32,157
if anybody's ever done that.

686
00:29:32,378 --> 00:29:34,019
It just keeps you sharp, you know?

687
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:36,340
Just take that 10 minutes, draw, sketch, write,

688
00:29:36,681 --> 00:29:38,242
make a little music, do what you gotta do,

689
00:29:38,302 --> 00:29:41,204
but find that time if it's your passion, absolutely.

690
00:29:41,604 --> 00:29:43,045
And we are out of time.

691
00:29:43,085 --> 00:29:44,526
Thank you guys so much for coming.

692
00:29:44,546 --> 00:29:45,226
This was awesome.

693
00:29:45,567 --> 00:29:45,907
Thank you.
