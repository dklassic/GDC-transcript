1
00:00:06,475 --> 00:00:11,772
Hello. All right, everyone. My clock shows 3.30, so I'm not going to waste anyone's time,

2
00:00:11,872 --> 00:00:13,196
and I'll just go ahead and get started.

3
00:00:14,584 --> 00:00:17,066
So I wanted to start out and thank everyone for coming.

4
00:00:17,386 --> 00:00:20,068
I know that capturing reference is not the sexiest topic

5
00:00:20,168 --> 00:00:22,429
in game development, so I'm really appreciative

6
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:23,690
of you guys for coming.

7
00:00:25,011 --> 00:00:27,753
So as my slide indicates here, my topic today

8
00:00:27,853 --> 00:00:30,455
is about our reference gathering techniques

9
00:00:30,495 --> 00:00:31,435
for Forza Motorsport.

10
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:33,917
And in particular, I'm going to focus

11
00:00:34,017 --> 00:00:37,540
on some of our best practices around taking environment

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,642
reference, so how we source a lot of the tracks in our game.

13
00:00:45,999 --> 00:00:48,260
Okay, so just as a quick background,

14
00:00:48,741 --> 00:00:50,762
Turn 10 Studios, which is the studio I work at,

15
00:00:50,862 --> 00:00:52,683
is one of the first party Microsoft studios.

16
00:00:53,123 --> 00:00:55,284
So, our mission, if you don't know,

17
00:00:55,484 --> 00:00:57,205
is to help create Xbox games

18
00:00:57,245 --> 00:00:59,267
that sell our consoles, to be frank.

19
00:00:59,747 --> 00:01:02,328
And so, our particular studio was formed

20
00:01:02,388 --> 00:01:04,970
to create racing titles, and so that is...

21
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:07,191
my destiny in life.

22
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:11,513
And so, you can see here some of the titles

23
00:01:11,533 --> 00:01:12,874
that we've created so far.

24
00:01:13,254 --> 00:01:17,116
And so, on the left you see Forza's one through four

25
00:01:17,517 --> 00:01:20,538
that were created for the original Xbox and Xbox 360.

26
00:01:20,978 --> 00:01:22,679
And hopefully it's not a big surprise to you

27
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:25,121
that our latest project was Forza Motorsport 5,

28
00:01:25,781 --> 00:01:27,382
which shipped as a launch title

29
00:01:27,682 --> 00:01:29,923
on the Xbox One last holiday.

30
00:01:30,896 --> 00:01:32,918
So a little background about myself.

31
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:36,241
I left Disney Animation after over 10 years

32
00:01:36,521 --> 00:01:39,344
and I joined Turn 10 at the beginning of production

33
00:01:39,504 --> 00:01:42,366
on Forza Motorsport 4, so it was about four years ago.

34
00:01:44,048 --> 00:01:46,710
And I operate as the technical art director there.

35
00:01:48,345 --> 00:01:50,746
Okay, so for folks who aren't familiar

36
00:01:51,126 --> 00:01:51,986
that much with our title,

37
00:01:52,226 --> 00:01:54,067
I thought I would play a quick clip

38
00:01:54,127 --> 00:01:57,129
to introduce our game and give you a sense

39
00:01:57,169 --> 00:01:59,710
for the scale and the kind of content quality

40
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:01,190
that we try and attain. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪

41
00:02:33,162 --> 00:02:35,323
All right, that was a condensed from our launch trailer.

42
00:02:35,623 --> 00:02:38,264
So that was just a 30 second taste of what

43
00:02:38,304 --> 00:02:39,185
we have going on in the game.

44
00:02:39,645 --> 00:02:41,446
And if you like it, buy more.

45
00:02:43,347 --> 00:02:45,308
All right, so what am I going to talk about?

46
00:02:45,868 --> 00:02:48,469
I wanted to kind of intro the topic.

47
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,371
The Forza Motorsport environments that we build

48
00:02:51,831 --> 00:02:53,452
mostly represent real world tracks.

49
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:56,433
And by real world, I mean they exist in the real world.

50
00:02:56,573 --> 00:02:58,814
And so we're trying to model after some reality that's

51
00:02:58,834 --> 00:02:59,015
there.

52
00:02:59,995 --> 00:03:02,277
We also have a handful of fictional circuits.

53
00:03:02,577 --> 00:03:05,099
So those are circuits that exist in like a certain

54
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:06,800
real life environment or motif.

55
00:03:07,141 --> 00:03:10,623
And so for our latest project, Prague was our cover track.

56
00:03:10,903 --> 00:03:13,565
And so we went to the city, there's no race track

57
00:03:13,645 --> 00:03:15,647
through the middle of the city, and so we kind of

58
00:03:15,667 --> 00:03:17,648
had to invent some circuit through it.

59
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:21,071
And so it was a little imaginary and piecing together

60
00:03:21,091 --> 00:03:23,613
this and that to try and build something

61
00:03:23,633 --> 00:03:25,034
that would make a compelling race course.

62
00:03:26,017 --> 00:03:29,480
So all of us in this room, when we're creating 3D art content,

63
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:33,383
hopefully you guys know that we have to create environments

64
00:03:33,783 --> 00:03:36,585
and worlds from thin air into 3D.

65
00:03:37,165 --> 00:03:39,527
And so, like in our game, there's

66
00:03:39,567 --> 00:03:40,888
a lot of real world environments,

67
00:03:40,948 --> 00:03:42,469
and there's a lot of imaginary environments

68
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:43,410
that you might have to build.

69
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,652
And so I hope some of these techniques

70
00:03:45,752 --> 00:03:48,253
you'll find applicable to the specific titles

71
00:03:48,273 --> 00:03:48,914
that you're working on.

72
00:03:49,334 --> 00:03:54,858
So, no matter where we work in games or film, we have to build these worlds with textures

73
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:55,539
and polygons.

74
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:57,220
Those are the tools at our disposal.

75
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:02,785
So anything that we can do to author those textures and polygons faster is going to result

76
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:05,527
in cheaper budgets, more content, and just general...

77
00:04:07,128 --> 00:04:10,571
fairy dust feelings, I guess, from everyone involved in the production of the game.

78
00:04:11,092 --> 00:04:15,256
So, at Turn 10, when we sat down to imagine this new project that we were going to be

79
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:20,441
embarking on, Forza 5, it was for the launch of a new console generation, and we knew that

80
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:26,767
there was going to be some huge content demands, and that we were going to have to push it

81
00:04:26,968 --> 00:04:28,369
further than we'd ever pushed it before.

82
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,934
So, as we started investigating our processes,

83
00:04:32,294 --> 00:04:34,255
we kind of became convinced that the solid

84
00:04:34,295 --> 00:04:36,637
reference gathering techniques were the beginning

85
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:38,758
or the foundation of creating content

86
00:04:39,138 --> 00:04:40,179
more quickly and accurately.

87
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:45,121
So, also just to be clear, reference gathering

88
00:04:45,182 --> 00:04:47,643
is the process of trying to document an environment

89
00:04:47,823 --> 00:04:50,725
or capture everything you can about a certain place

90
00:04:51,025 --> 00:04:53,967
so that your environment team can create those results

91
00:04:54,007 --> 00:04:56,788
in 3D, so that's gonna be the main topic of my talk today.

92
00:04:58,348 --> 00:04:59,428
Alright, so quick agenda.

93
00:05:00,048 --> 00:05:02,349
This is one of the few bulleted slides I have on here.

94
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:03,989
So what I'm gonna talk about today is,

95
00:05:04,249 --> 00:05:06,370
I'm first gonna describe the old school ways.

96
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,150
So how we used to gather reference.

97
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,131
And then I'm gonna quickly switch

98
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:12,051
to some of our newer techniques.

99
00:05:12,351 --> 00:05:15,032
So I'll introduce you to our hot new texture action.

100
00:05:15,672 --> 00:05:17,292
I'll talk about some spherical video

101
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:19,013
things that we played with

102
00:05:19,073 --> 00:05:20,353
and used in the production of the game.

103
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:22,233
I'm gonna talk about laser scanning.

104
00:05:22,393 --> 00:05:24,234
And then finally, a few quick words on

105
00:05:24,614 --> 00:05:25,994
why we feel like this is important

106
00:05:26,154 --> 00:05:28,255
and hopefully you can get something out of it as well.

107
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:36,046
Okay, so when I first joined Turn 10, the team wanted to send me out on a reference

108
00:05:36,066 --> 00:05:40,453
gathering trip just so I could see what it was going to be like. So a few weeks after

109
00:05:40,493 --> 00:05:44,058
I started, I went on a trip to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.

110
00:05:45,135 --> 00:05:49,139
And so, there, we were starting from scratch

111
00:05:49,359 --> 00:05:50,980
the process of building a new track.

112
00:05:51,501 --> 00:05:53,503
So, what is the absolute minimum

113
00:05:53,563 --> 00:05:55,084
that you need to capture reference

114
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:57,927
for a 3D environment that you're trying to build?

115
00:05:58,788 --> 00:05:59,328
It's photos.

116
00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:02,930
And so photo reference is a pretty standard practice

117
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:03,790
in reference gathering.

118
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:06,671
And so like many other studios, we

119
00:06:06,691 --> 00:06:09,432
will send a whole team of three or four artists

120
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:10,672
out to the track.

121
00:06:11,212 --> 00:06:12,793
And we will arm them with cameras

122
00:06:13,293 --> 00:06:14,713
and set them loose on the track.

123
00:06:15,254 --> 00:06:17,334
And we have a spec that we follow.

124
00:06:17,534 --> 00:06:19,595
So here's the specific things to take pictures of.

125
00:06:20,115 --> 00:06:21,155
And we will go to that track.

126
00:06:21,475 --> 00:06:23,476
So like many artists with cameras,

127
00:06:23,776 --> 00:06:26,197
we unfortunately get more than a few photos

128
00:06:26,457 --> 00:06:27,597
that end up looking like this.

129
00:06:29,017 --> 00:06:35,699
But in reality, we actually end up with tens of thousands of photos on each trip.

130
00:06:36,179 --> 00:06:40,860
So, we have all these photos that are scattered all over the place and it's really daunting, right?

131
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,861
We bring the photos back and then the artist sits down and opens this directory

132
00:06:45,201 --> 00:06:48,222
and it's like, here's five million pictures for me to sift through.

133
00:06:48,582 --> 00:06:52,043
And how do I piece that back into an environment that I can actually build?

134
00:06:53,464 --> 00:06:56,145
So what's missing from this is context.

135
00:06:56,345 --> 00:06:58,246
You don't know where a particular photo is

136
00:06:58,306 --> 00:06:59,526
in relation to something else.

137
00:07:00,027 --> 00:07:02,127
And to just take a folder like this

138
00:07:02,248 --> 00:07:04,448
and expect a team to build a 3D environment

139
00:07:04,649 --> 00:07:05,669
is asking way too much.

140
00:07:07,282 --> 00:07:12,567
So, on our Indy trip, one of my particular responsibilities was to go around and take pictures of buildings.

141
00:07:12,928 --> 00:07:16,531
So, it all made sense to me when I was there, because I was in the physical location.

142
00:07:16,832 --> 00:07:20,735
So, I walked around, I'm like, hey, I see a building, let me take a picture of it.

143
00:07:21,036 --> 00:07:22,978
And so, I'd go off and take pictures of buildings.

144
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:27,422
Then when I got back, to my dismay, I had rolls of pictures that looked like this.

145
00:07:27,602 --> 00:07:28,903
So, this is a program building.

146
00:07:29,204 --> 00:07:30,465
So, where is that on the track?

147
00:07:31,045 --> 00:07:33,607
Nobody knows, so people would place it randomly.

148
00:07:34,648 --> 00:07:36,930
So, what we found is that there's a big disconnect

149
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:40,612
to being at a place and using our human brain skills

150
00:07:40,892 --> 00:07:42,894
to kind of process exactly where you are

151
00:07:43,014 --> 00:07:43,814
and to get that feel.

152
00:07:44,295 --> 00:07:45,456
And there's that big disconnect

153
00:07:45,496 --> 00:07:47,997
to a whole directory full of images.

154
00:07:48,418 --> 00:07:51,380
And so, the poor person that's on the other end of this,

155
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,882
who wasn't there, it's tough for them to get some context

156
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:56,684
about what this picture actually represents.

157
00:07:57,449 --> 00:08:00,512
Here's another building that has awesome smoked turkey legs.

158
00:08:01,733 --> 00:08:04,175
And so, where is this building in relation to anything else?

159
00:08:04,556 --> 00:08:06,518
So, to add context to these photos,

160
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:09,421
what you really need is videos as well.

161
00:08:10,398 --> 00:08:13,161
So luckily that was part of our reference gathering spec.

162
00:08:13,482 --> 00:08:15,825
So we also went around and shot videos.

163
00:08:16,285 --> 00:08:18,528
And so we had some kind of method to the madness.

164
00:08:18,829 --> 00:08:22,033
So part of our reference spec was to go around

165
00:08:22,453 --> 00:08:26,278
and mount a video camera or a DSLR

166
00:08:26,338 --> 00:08:27,400
that had video capabilities.

167
00:08:27,846 --> 00:08:31,350
and kind of drive the whole circuit of the track

168
00:08:31,671 --> 00:08:33,934
and then take 45 degree increments.

169
00:08:34,134 --> 00:08:37,358
So we would go around once with the camera facing forward,

170
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:40,602
then 45 degrees right, left, 90 degrees, and so forth.

171
00:08:41,203 --> 00:08:43,446
And so the poor artists back at home.

172
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:46,151
end up with something like this.

173
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:49,054
So at Indy, before I play this video,

174
00:08:49,974 --> 00:08:51,916
instead of giving us an awesome Indy car

175
00:08:51,996 --> 00:08:54,078
for us to cruise around and take videos of,

176
00:08:54,418 --> 00:08:55,840
they provided us with golf carts

177
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,642
because they have a golf course that's part of the track.

178
00:08:58,982 --> 00:09:01,084
And so we got these, each one of us

179
00:09:01,204 --> 00:09:03,206
got an awesome golf cart to race around.

180
00:09:03,686 --> 00:09:05,308
Each one of these took 15 minutes

181
00:09:05,348 --> 00:09:06,489
to get around the whole circuit.

182
00:09:06,969 --> 00:09:11,872
So, to capture all the angles that we wanted for our video specs requires eight drives

183
00:09:11,892 --> 00:09:17,236
around the track and it was fatiguing both to us as the driver and as the artist back

184
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:18,737
at home who was trying to witness this.

185
00:09:19,177 --> 00:09:21,359
So, this is some of the awesome action you get.

186
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,543
So, when you're an artist back at home and you're trying to build, like, this track, and you see,

187
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:30,928
hey, there's a truck in the left. Oh, wait, now I passed it, so I don't know what it looks like.

188
00:09:31,228 --> 00:09:35,892
Then you've got to go to the 45 degree or the 90 degree left one and kind of, like, get motion

189
00:09:35,932 --> 00:09:41,598
sickness and see this. And so, this was our video spec. This is what was happening as part of the

190
00:09:41,618 --> 00:09:41,758
thing.

191
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,463
So also, so photos and videos are kind of a given.

192
00:09:46,944 --> 00:09:49,246
So to bolster some of our high-tech credness,

193
00:09:50,347 --> 00:09:52,810
we also lugged around some other digital tools.

194
00:09:53,731 --> 00:09:57,274
So this is a digital level where we can go around the track

195
00:09:57,715 --> 00:09:59,296
and you place it down and it tells you

196
00:09:59,337 --> 00:10:02,159
how many degrees the track has of camber.

197
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,424
And so that's like the angle of the track for car optimal performance.

198
00:10:07,964 --> 00:10:13,910
So this is me diligently marking in my journal the measurements coming around turn two of the Indy Speedway.

199
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:18,854
And what we would do is we would have to go to several different spots along that line

200
00:10:19,054 --> 00:10:22,597
because the camber changes actually as you go from the inner part to the outer part.

201
00:10:22,957 --> 00:10:25,919
And then you'd march down another like 10, 20 feet or so,

202
00:10:25,999 --> 00:10:26,860
and then do another thing.

203
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,901
And then so I'm making little X's on my map

204
00:10:28,982 --> 00:10:31,263
and saying like 4.1 degrees.

205
00:10:31,483 --> 00:10:33,765
And then someone at home would have to kind of process that.

206
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:36,787
So on foot, this took freaking forever.

207
00:10:37,227 --> 00:10:37,808
So it sucks.

208
00:10:40,913 --> 00:10:44,796
Alright, so the last part of our reference gathering spec was GPS.

209
00:10:45,116 --> 00:10:52,301
So, this is our track production lead, Trevor, and he's walking around with his nerdy GPS backpack.

210
00:10:53,082 --> 00:10:57,545
And so, he had to walk this entire two and a half miles of Indy Speedway.

211
00:10:57,965 --> 00:11:01,587
on every edge that you can see.

212
00:11:01,968 --> 00:11:06,110
So here he is on the inner portion of the track for F1,

213
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:10,612
and he would walk down this line and take GPS measurements,

214
00:11:10,893 --> 00:11:12,373
and then he'd walk to the other side

215
00:11:12,674 --> 00:11:14,074
and take GPS measurements,

216
00:11:14,354 --> 00:11:16,176
and then if he had extra time, he would say,

217
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,677
oh, there's a lamp post there, I should probably snap that.

218
00:11:19,097 --> 00:11:22,139
And so at the end of that whole process,

219
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:27,403
If you have a good satellite signal and you have a good pair of walking shoes, you end up with something like this.

220
00:11:27,784 --> 00:11:38,454
So this is our 3D map of the Indy Speedway and you can see every single footstep that he took and kind of the measurements and the guides that we have to build this.

221
00:11:39,425 --> 00:11:43,148
So, that is a summary of our old school ways.

222
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:45,829
When we come home from the reference trip,

223
00:11:46,149 --> 00:11:49,251
we would take these photos, the videos, GPS data,

224
00:11:49,331 --> 00:11:51,713
all that stuff, and we would just hand it over

225
00:11:51,773 --> 00:11:52,733
to our environment team.

226
00:11:53,094 --> 00:11:54,655
And this poor team of like, you know,

227
00:11:54,735 --> 00:11:56,716
tens to hundreds of people have to like,

228
00:11:56,736 --> 00:11:58,757
really take this and puzzle it back together

229
00:11:58,777 --> 00:12:00,838
and figure out like, what exactly is what?

230
00:12:00,878 --> 00:12:03,060
And so, they download internet images,

231
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,681
and like poke around, and then like,

232
00:12:04,941 --> 00:12:06,562
come by and ask like, you know,

233
00:12:06,582 --> 00:12:08,003
this port-a-potty that you took a picture of,

234
00:12:08,043 --> 00:12:08,643
like, where is it?

235
00:12:09,284 --> 00:12:11,805
I don't know, like watch my bouncy, crappy video.

236
00:12:13,306 --> 00:12:15,948
So, it's actually amazing that we ended up

237
00:12:15,988 --> 00:12:16,909
shipping our game at all.

238
00:12:17,429 --> 00:12:20,671
So, some of the questions that we found ourselves is,

239
00:12:21,071 --> 00:12:22,252
how can anyone tell what's happening

240
00:12:22,292 --> 00:12:23,473
with this reference that we're gathering?

241
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:28,888
Second question is, how do we even manage to build anything out of all this stuff that we come back with?

242
00:12:29,489 --> 00:12:32,772
And the biggest question of all is, what if we miss something?

243
00:12:33,412 --> 00:12:39,858
So, just to touch on that real quickly, when we started our process for Forza 5,

244
00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:44,682
we knew that no matter how complete you try to be with these old reference techniques,

245
00:12:45,102 --> 00:12:46,503
there's always something that you're going to miss.

246
00:12:46,883 --> 00:12:50,306
So, if you have a picture of an alleyway, and there's something down there,

247
00:12:50,446 --> 00:12:52,888
and you're like, well, we're going to drive by it, but what's down that alley?

248
00:12:53,729 --> 00:12:58,091
perhaps nobody took a picture right there. Or like there's a building, what's behind that

249
00:12:58,131 --> 00:13:02,653
building because we actually have to build it. I don't know, just make something up. So as we

250
00:13:02,673 --> 00:13:08,315
settled on Prague as our reference or as our kind of cover track for the game, we started planning

251
00:13:08,395 --> 00:13:11,977
our reference needs and creating a new plan for the trip.

252
00:13:12,457 --> 00:13:19,184
So, since we are going to be traveling a particularly long distance, so here's us going from the Seattle area to Prague,

253
00:13:20,085 --> 00:13:25,530
we thought it would be really important to our studio management and executives that we plan a complete coverage spec,

254
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:28,192
because the worst thing that you can do is say,

255
00:13:28,693 --> 00:13:33,618
oh, we forgot something, can you send us back to Prague, despite the deep pockets of a corporation like Microsoft.

256
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:39,779
Okay, so how did we arrive at a situation

257
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:42,440
where we tried to consider our reference gathering

258
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,160
techniques because as I mentioned before,

259
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,021
it's not a sexy part of track production.

260
00:13:46,341 --> 00:13:47,861
And when you say, well we have to build

261
00:13:47,881 --> 00:13:49,761
all these environments, it's not the immediate

262
00:13:49,781 --> 00:13:50,522
thing that you jump to.

263
00:13:51,022 --> 00:13:52,642
So this is kind of a breakdown.

264
00:13:53,282 --> 00:13:55,683
The TechArt team did some data mining after Forza 4

265
00:13:55,963 --> 00:13:57,423
and we're like, well what sucks about

266
00:13:57,463 --> 00:13:58,543
building our environments?

267
00:13:58,884 --> 00:14:00,984
And so I took some key figures off this.

268
00:14:01,604 --> 00:14:04,385
But here you can kind of get a sense for this pie chart

269
00:14:04,565 --> 00:14:06,445
of where exactly we spend our time.

270
00:14:07,566 --> 00:14:11,247
So, building this detailed environment actually takes a lot of man time.

271
00:14:11,648 --> 00:14:16,710
And so, when we sat down to plot out what takes the longest, starting from the beginning

272
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:23,373
of the very pre-production-ish kind of stage, we were surprised to find that the process

273
00:14:23,413 --> 00:14:27,575
of laying out the shape and creating all these rough objects actually took a really long

274
00:14:27,595 --> 00:14:28,235
time combined.

275
00:14:29,256 --> 00:14:32,898
So what you see here is there's two areas in particular.

276
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:37,137
There's this course phase, which is our process

277
00:14:37,157 --> 00:14:39,800
for taking those GPS splines and kind of laying out

278
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,343
a road surface so that we can see what the driving

279
00:14:42,443 --> 00:14:43,244
area feels like.

280
00:14:43,805 --> 00:14:45,747
And then this rough phase at the bottom in.

281
00:14:48,335 --> 00:14:49,436
in the right-hand corner here.

282
00:14:49,776 --> 00:14:53,638
That's the process for taking blocks of white box objects,

283
00:14:53,678 --> 00:14:55,599
I guess, and saying, like, here's some trees,

284
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:56,819
here's a building that lives here.

285
00:14:57,319 --> 00:14:59,260
And so you can see those two added together

286
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:01,161
actually take almost as much time,

287
00:15:01,281 --> 00:15:03,343
or about as much time, as our refine stage,

288
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,884
which is where we're actually building out all the content

289
00:15:05,984 --> 00:15:08,005
and making sure it goes properly.

290
00:15:08,505 --> 00:15:10,486
So we attributed a lot of this

291
00:15:11,407 --> 00:15:13,288
kind of get up and running kind of time.

292
00:15:14,809 --> 00:15:17,811
to artists having to puzzle these reference pieces back together.

293
00:15:18,031 --> 00:15:22,074
You know, like, we can't take all these reference images and everything back to the studio

294
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:27,319
and then have them start building stuff and then like, you know, the first week we have some awesome drivable surface.

295
00:15:28,059 --> 00:15:30,821
It takes a lot of time to process all the data and to organize it and everything.

296
00:15:31,162 --> 00:15:35,605
So we were like, our general inability to quickly get up and running

297
00:15:36,086 --> 00:15:41,970
is really restricted by the kind of reference that we're coming back with,

298
00:15:42,111 --> 00:15:43,171
even for real life tracks.

299
00:15:44,852 --> 00:15:47,034
So, we rolled up our sleeves at the beginning

300
00:15:47,054 --> 00:15:49,415
of Forza 5, and we knew that we were targeting

301
00:15:49,475 --> 00:15:53,858
this much more content, and we decided to design

302
00:15:53,898 --> 00:15:55,539
an updated way to gather reference,

303
00:15:56,179 --> 00:15:58,441
which was the fundamental source

304
00:15:58,581 --> 00:16:00,082
of our content production going forward.

305
00:16:00,482 --> 00:16:03,064
So, what I'm gonna cover for the rest of the slide deck

306
00:16:03,664 --> 00:16:06,166
is how we've evolved our reference techniques,

307
00:16:06,586 --> 00:16:08,347
how we do things right now, and hopefully give you

308
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:09,428
some insights that you can take away.

309
00:16:11,042 --> 00:16:13,744
Okay, so, photo reference.

310
00:16:15,765 --> 00:16:17,507
I just want to note, we still take photos

311
00:16:17,627 --> 00:16:19,068
as part of our reference gathering,

312
00:16:19,188 --> 00:16:20,208
but we do it a lot smarter,

313
00:16:20,348 --> 00:16:22,170
and I'm gonna jump into some details on that.

314
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:25,812
Second point is, inspired by Henry Labona,

315
00:16:25,892 --> 00:16:28,554
who used to work at EA and moved over to Microsoft

316
00:16:28,614 --> 00:16:32,376
for a bit, in particular, he gave a GDC 2011 talk

317
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:34,478
called Art Direction Tools for Photoreal Games.

318
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:42,424
And in that talk he talked about some of the reference gathering and texture capture that goes into making video games.

319
00:16:42,685 --> 00:16:46,668
And we discovered that the way we were taking photographic reference was honestly stupid.

320
00:16:48,521 --> 00:16:56,929
And then the third point is that, you may have heard at GDC here, a lot of discussion about next-gen pipelines being based on a physically based model.

321
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:04,917
And so that includes material and lighting. A lot of next-gen pipelines are moving to that and a lot of the stuff at the tail end of that.

322
00:17:05,217 --> 00:17:08,421
Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 generation

323
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:10,903
were kind of headed towards this direction anyways.

324
00:17:11,284 --> 00:17:13,626
And physically based model means that you're modeling

325
00:17:13,746 --> 00:17:15,688
all your lighting and your material system

326
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:19,552
using mathematical formulas instead of just squinting

327
00:17:19,612 --> 00:17:22,095
and eyeing it and saying that's about the right color.

328
00:17:22,455 --> 00:17:24,877
So one of the critical pieces of that pipeline is

329
00:17:25,158 --> 00:17:27,080
if you don't feed in good stuff,

330
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,761
then you're gonna get crap out as well.

331
00:17:30,959 --> 00:17:33,560
Okay, so I'm gonna talk a little about

332
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,001
our photo reference gathering techniques.

333
00:17:35,361 --> 00:17:38,763
So what is notable about this particular photo up here,

334
00:17:38,903 --> 00:17:40,744
except for the awesome fact that Prague

335
00:17:40,784 --> 00:17:42,845
has a hippies festival that has its own website?

336
00:17:45,047 --> 00:17:47,769
The awesome thing is this little guy right here.

337
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:51,894
So this piece of tech is a portable Macbeth chart.

338
00:17:52,254 --> 00:17:54,056
So a Macbeth chart is something that has been used

339
00:17:54,096 --> 00:17:56,859
by professional photographers and cinematographers

340
00:17:57,019 --> 00:17:59,041
to calibrate color for years now.

341
00:18:00,142 --> 00:18:04,066
So this chart is a swatch of 24 bits of color

342
00:18:04,127 --> 00:18:05,488
that have known RGB values.

343
00:18:06,484 --> 00:18:09,246
And so our reference team will lug one of these around,

344
00:18:09,326 --> 00:18:11,488
each guy gets one, and we try and stick it

345
00:18:11,588 --> 00:18:14,010
into every picture that we take on our reference trips.

346
00:18:14,431 --> 00:18:15,411
So how does this help us?

347
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:22,685
So, this color checker tool, it comes with this pretty awesome software that automatically

348
00:18:22,745 --> 00:18:27,330
detects the chart in the presence of the photos that you have, and it matches the colors that

349
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:34,397
you have against the known RGB values. So, because they can calculate the deviation between

350
00:18:34,457 --> 00:18:39,042
the actual known colors and what it's actually showing up in your camera, it allows you to

351
00:18:39,102 --> 00:18:41,044
create a custom color profile.

352
00:18:41,564 --> 00:18:43,606
for your camera and the shooting conditions

353
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:44,987
at the time of your reference gathering.

354
00:18:45,288 --> 00:18:46,669
So if you keep a fixed exposure,

355
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:49,051
and ISO settings and everything,

356
00:18:49,312 --> 00:18:50,233
and then you just say like,

357
00:18:50,573 --> 00:18:52,214
from this time to this time,

358
00:18:52,455 --> 00:18:54,517
I was using this particular set of settings,

359
00:18:54,797 --> 00:18:56,158
you can create a camera profile

360
00:18:56,499 --> 00:18:58,981
that automatically color corrects

361
00:18:59,081 --> 00:19:01,423
for the environment that you're working in.

362
00:19:02,444 --> 00:19:05,027
So how does that color calibration work?

363
00:19:06,255 --> 00:19:09,498
So, with that profile, you can plug it into a tool

364
00:19:09,518 --> 00:19:12,820
like Adobe Bridge, and so when you pull in Adobe Bridge,

365
00:19:13,181 --> 00:19:16,723
we have outlined here, where you assign the camera profile.

366
00:19:17,164 --> 00:19:20,146
So, when you assign this, it color corrects your image,

367
00:19:20,366 --> 00:19:22,748
and you can batch do a bunch of these at the same time.

368
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:25,550
And this ensures that the colors that we're feeding

369
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:28,492
into our physically based system are actually correct

370
00:19:28,733 --> 00:19:30,494
and at a known good standard,

371
00:19:31,195 --> 00:19:32,816
which is really important, as I mentioned before.

372
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:37,491
So, the other thing we can do with this chart that we have

373
00:19:37,751 --> 00:19:39,513
is get some white balance accuracy.

374
00:19:39,933 --> 00:19:41,194
So, on the left side of the chart

375
00:19:41,214 --> 00:19:42,254
that you see in the picture here,

376
00:19:43,335 --> 00:19:45,797
we have varying shades of white to black.

377
00:19:46,297 --> 00:19:49,159
And so, you can just color sample the white part

378
00:19:49,239 --> 00:19:50,420
and the black part, which are different

379
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,681
from the color calibration.

380
00:19:52,081 --> 00:19:56,104
And you can set a good white balance and a black balance

381
00:19:56,844 --> 00:19:58,125
so that you ensure kind of like

382
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:00,306
that your values are in a good range.

383
00:20:00,847 --> 00:20:05,269
And so we try to do this for every photo that we're going to be using for a reference,

384
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:08,792
and then we save it that way and commit it into our repository,

385
00:20:09,072 --> 00:20:14,635
so that anyone that's trying to take a swatch of this is already working at a known good kind of stance.

386
00:20:18,889 --> 00:20:22,153
So here's a quick example of what this can do for us.

387
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:26,118
So we actually took a couple pictures at a racetrack

388
00:20:26,579 --> 00:20:28,682
with varied exposure, just so we can see

389
00:20:29,683 --> 00:20:31,545
as part of our testing as we're leading up

390
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:32,246
to reference gathering.

391
00:20:32,607 --> 00:20:35,007
So on the top, you see image number 7336.

392
00:20:36,648 --> 00:20:37,968
We took it at a low exposure.

393
00:20:38,268 --> 00:20:41,229
And then later on, we fumbled around

394
00:20:41,289 --> 00:20:42,909
with the exposure settings, and then we

395
00:20:42,929 --> 00:20:43,729
get the one on the bottom.

396
00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:44,829
So this is before.

397
00:20:45,169 --> 00:20:47,250
Then after the process, you end up

398
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:48,210
with the pictures on the right.

399
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:50,491
And it's to a known good value.

400
00:20:50,691 --> 00:20:52,571
So no matter what circumstances you

401
00:20:52,591 --> 00:20:53,831
were trying to take the picture in,

402
00:20:54,312 --> 00:20:55,672
because we are capturing raw images,

403
00:20:55,912 --> 00:20:58,553
we can adjust the exposure and the white balance

404
00:20:58,573 --> 00:20:59,353
and all that afterwards.

405
00:20:59,653 --> 00:21:01,713
And then we end up with a known good target.

406
00:21:06,597 --> 00:21:27,232
One final thing I wanted to mention is, because we have this increasing reliance on a physically-based material model, where almost all the lighting and material calculations are done with mathematical formulas that are meant to mimic the physical world, it's especially important that these images and the values are correct.

407
00:21:28,262 --> 00:21:32,783
So, if you don't put in the right stuff, then you end up with colors gone wild.

408
00:21:32,983 --> 00:21:37,945
And we've actually seen that on past projects, where if we adjust exposure or bloom on something,

409
00:21:38,225 --> 00:21:40,446
something will unrealistically blow out.

410
00:21:40,886 --> 00:21:44,747
And we've always had to go in and kind of like mess around with the texture and be like,

411
00:21:44,787 --> 00:21:47,128
is it too white? Is it too high of value?

412
00:21:47,548 --> 00:21:49,388
And so, this is an image of...

413
00:21:49,789 --> 00:21:53,591
one of our environment artists took a bunch of known things

414
00:21:53,631 --> 00:21:55,312
that occur pretty frequently on racetracks,

415
00:21:55,592 --> 00:21:59,474
and he kind of dialed in the appropriate value numbers

416
00:21:59,754 --> 00:22:02,015
that each one should be in, in an approximate range.

417
00:22:02,295 --> 00:22:04,176
And so this way, if you take this image,

418
00:22:05,397 --> 00:22:08,579
this is a 32-bit image, and you start adjusting exposure,

419
00:22:08,879 --> 00:22:10,420
the stuff that you expect to blow out

420
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,621
when exposure is high is gonna get that.

421
00:22:12,901 --> 00:22:14,502
And that's kind of key to feeding

422
00:22:15,422 --> 00:22:16,883
our material and lighting pipeline.

423
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:19,224
I just wanted to call out real quickly,

424
00:22:19,264 --> 00:22:20,124
I don't have a slide for this,

425
00:22:20,184 --> 00:22:22,305
but Nick Sagal, our rendering engineer,

426
00:22:22,385 --> 00:22:25,266
is giving a talk about the material and lighting pipeline

427
00:22:25,306 --> 00:22:27,267
for Forza 5 tomorrow at 2.30.

428
00:22:27,687 --> 00:22:29,648
So you should attend that if you're interested

429
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:32,149
to see how all this reference gets fed in

430
00:22:32,369 --> 00:22:33,049
a little bit later.

431
00:22:34,009 --> 00:22:35,950
Okay, so that's reference images.

432
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,911
That's kind of where we've evolved our pipeline.

433
00:22:38,171 --> 00:22:40,491
And the images are at least a lot better quality

434
00:22:40,631 --> 00:22:42,112
and to a known circumstance,

435
00:22:42,392 --> 00:22:44,493
even though we still don't know where the heck anything is.

436
00:22:46,255 --> 00:22:49,196
So remember this crappy video from Indianapolis?

437
00:22:50,616 --> 00:22:53,158
The still video is boring to watch,

438
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:58,020
and the field of view really limits what you're able to see.

439
00:22:59,201 --> 00:23:03,704
So we thought to ourselves, wouldn't it be sweet if we could just pause in a certain location

440
00:23:03,984 --> 00:23:09,467
and then look around so if we pass that truck, we can just look at it instead of having to stare at this

441
00:23:09,507 --> 00:23:11,508
and kind of decipher exactly where everything is.

442
00:23:11,908 --> 00:23:16,951
So we played around with things like QuickTime VR and panoramic photos and all that stuff.

443
00:23:18,132 --> 00:23:20,394
that you have a way of taking a 360 photo

444
00:23:20,614 --> 00:23:21,775
and you can just stand in one place

445
00:23:21,815 --> 00:23:23,436
and you take photos from all angles

446
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:25,838
and then you can compress it down into something

447
00:23:25,878 --> 00:23:27,400
where you can, standing in one place,

448
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,121
just look around in all directions.

449
00:23:29,722 --> 00:23:31,203
So we're like, it'd be cool

450
00:23:31,664 --> 00:23:33,565
if there was some kind of amazing tech out there

451
00:23:33,906 --> 00:23:35,587
so that we could do that with videos as well.

452
00:23:36,147 --> 00:23:37,889
And it turns out that there is.

453
00:23:38,429 --> 00:23:40,451
And we just didn't know about it

454
00:23:40,471 --> 00:23:41,852
because we hadn't paid attention really

455
00:23:41,893 --> 00:23:43,494
to our reference gathering processes before.

456
00:23:48,206 --> 00:23:50,328
So, after some extended research,

457
00:23:50,989 --> 00:23:52,530
our tech art team came across this,

458
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:54,472
and this is a spherical panorama camera.

459
00:23:55,013 --> 00:23:57,675
And in this specific case, this is a ladybug camera,

460
00:23:58,356 --> 00:24:01,198
and it's used by a lot of the Google Maps and Bing Maps

461
00:24:01,619 --> 00:24:03,561
as they capture some of the stuff that's feeding

462
00:24:03,621 --> 00:24:05,523
into our modern day mapping technology.

463
00:24:06,103 --> 00:24:08,105
And so, we love this camera so much

464
00:24:08,185 --> 00:24:10,207
that I'm gonna put a halo on it while I talk about it.

465
00:24:11,507 --> 00:24:13,848
So, we love this ladybug.

466
00:24:14,588 --> 00:24:17,069
These kinds of devices aren't really that common

467
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:19,469
or widely used, so it actually took us a while

468
00:24:19,509 --> 00:24:21,750
to track down something that would actually

469
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:23,570
suit our purposes and be useful in production.

470
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:26,951
So, how well this worked was actually a big surprise to us

471
00:24:27,031 --> 00:24:29,472
and we were stunned at how really accessible

472
00:24:29,512 --> 00:24:30,312
this tech had become.

473
00:24:30,772 --> 00:24:32,512
So, a couple things about this camera.

474
00:24:32,852 --> 00:24:35,153
This camera comes with a bulletproof,

475
00:24:35,513 --> 00:24:37,433
awesome looking black suitcase that looks like

476
00:24:37,474 --> 00:24:39,554
one of those nuclear code things that you carry around.

477
00:24:39,934 --> 00:24:41,979
And so, it's always a pleasure to walk around with

478
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,603
when we're in Prague and other places.

479
00:24:44,766 --> 00:24:46,370
We took this suitcase along on all our

480
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:48,014
reference gathering trips for Forza Five.

481
00:24:49,003 --> 00:24:52,784
So the camera itself is really slick.

482
00:24:53,184 --> 00:24:55,865
This camera comes with an array of five cameras

483
00:24:55,885 --> 00:24:58,225
around the center core, and then there's one on top.

484
00:24:58,806 --> 00:25:01,286
And there's various modules you'll see at the bottom

485
00:25:01,646 --> 00:25:03,667
that kind of do the streaming over wires

486
00:25:03,747 --> 00:25:07,287
to your capturing device, and also do some real-time

487
00:25:07,307 --> 00:25:08,548
stitching of the images together.

488
00:25:08,988 --> 00:25:10,548
So whenever it was appropriate,

489
00:25:10,868 --> 00:25:11,928
we would take this camera out,

490
00:25:12,228 --> 00:25:15,029
we'd mount it on a car or walk around with it,

491
00:25:15,189 --> 00:25:16,709
and then we would record the 360-degree streams.

492
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:21,793
So, real quick, this is the 3D video process

493
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:24,195
that you use in order to make it useful to your artists.

494
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:27,358
So on the left here, you can see we record the video,

495
00:25:27,439 --> 00:25:29,300
and we record a certain number of them.

496
00:25:30,101 --> 00:25:31,803
Each one has to go through an encoding pass

497
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,344
to get it into the format that you want,

498
00:25:33,644 --> 00:25:34,725
and then you have to have a player

499
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:37,368
that kind of lets you watch it back.

500
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:41,472
And so, I'm gonna provide details on each step

501
00:25:41,512 --> 00:25:42,933
in the next few slides.

502
00:25:43,915 --> 00:25:47,315
So here's us, there's me in the silhouette,

503
00:25:47,355 --> 00:25:50,456
driving around Prague with this awesome contraption

504
00:25:50,496 --> 00:25:51,456
going outside our window.

505
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:54,657
So this camera, you can see the wires heading into the car,

506
00:25:54,977 --> 00:25:56,377
it's actually hooked up to a laptop

507
00:25:56,677 --> 00:25:58,478
that is capturing all the streams.

508
00:25:58,918 --> 00:26:01,418
And so the six cameras on this guy

509
00:26:01,918 --> 00:26:05,819
simultaneously record huge gigabyte-sized streams

510
00:26:06,139 --> 00:26:07,820
and it stitches them together in real time.

511
00:26:10,414 --> 00:26:13,397
After we do the recording and we have a full laptop,

512
00:26:14,417 --> 00:26:17,260
we have some software that comes with the camera

513
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,842
and it lets you encode it into whatever format

514
00:26:19,882 --> 00:26:20,302
that you want.

515
00:26:20,762 --> 00:26:23,965
So here we are, here's a video that's kind of doing

516
00:26:24,005 --> 00:26:27,227
the 360 mapping and the distortion to kind of make it

517
00:26:27,247 --> 00:26:29,889
so that it can map onto a spherical viewing

518
00:26:29,929 --> 00:26:31,110
kind of thing.

519
00:26:32,511 --> 00:26:34,593
So we encode the video into a panoramic 360 stream.

520
00:26:36,332 --> 00:26:38,352
So this is what you get at the end.

521
00:26:38,772 --> 00:26:42,893
And so this right here looks like it's a standard video.

522
00:26:43,153 --> 00:26:45,474
And so as I start playing it, you'll

523
00:26:45,494 --> 00:26:47,194
see that we're driving down.

524
00:26:47,534 --> 00:26:49,495
But the difference is I can use my mouse

525
00:26:49,615 --> 00:26:51,455
and just start turning around in any direction.

526
00:26:51,755 --> 00:26:53,456
So I can see exactly where something is.

527
00:26:54,636 --> 00:26:56,176
I can take it to any point, pause,

528
00:26:56,896 --> 00:27:00,077
zoom in on a certain location, and see exactly some detail

529
00:27:00,117 --> 00:27:00,877
that I might have missed.

530
00:27:01,177 --> 00:27:02,298
And it's all a single stream.

531
00:27:02,838 --> 00:27:05,641
I can jump to any certain point in the stream and look around.

532
00:27:05,701 --> 00:27:08,745
So we forgot to take pictures of some tram wires when we were out there.

533
00:27:08,785 --> 00:27:10,767
And we're like, hey, that's all over the place in Prague.

534
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:14,631
So we could jump to a certain location, scope around,

535
00:27:14,952 --> 00:27:18,896
and really get that missed reference without having to ask for a plane ticket back to Prague.

536
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:24,200
And so it's really cool because this also gives you the sense of immersion

537
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:29,142
And the artists who weren't able to go on the reference trip can kind of play these back

538
00:27:29,543 --> 00:27:35,166
Everyone has access to it and then they can really get a sense for what is it like to drive down this particular part?

539
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:35,646
of the track

540
00:27:36,426 --> 00:27:37,407
What did things look like?

541
00:27:38,928 --> 00:27:43,050
And what are some pieces that we would have otherwise made up in any other circumstance?

542
00:27:43,865 --> 00:27:46,688
So this has been a tremendously useful tool for our artists

543
00:27:47,009 --> 00:27:49,631
who didn't get to go, to capture the feel

544
00:27:49,711 --> 00:27:52,354
of that environment and make it a lot more interactive.

545
00:27:52,875 --> 00:27:54,977
So that was a cool thing that we discovered

546
00:27:54,997 --> 00:27:55,697
in the course of Forza 5.

547
00:27:58,385 --> 00:27:59,586
All right, lasers.

548
00:28:00,166 --> 00:28:03,348
Lasers make everything sweet.

549
00:28:03,808 --> 00:28:06,250
So I'm gonna talk a little about our laser scanning

550
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:08,911
processes that we were using on Forza 5.

551
00:28:09,371 --> 00:28:11,452
So here's a quick diagram, that's an overview

552
00:28:11,532 --> 00:28:14,234
of how we make laser scanning useful in our pipeline.

553
00:28:14,854 --> 00:28:18,097
So, first thing we do is take a bunch of scans,

554
00:28:18,498 --> 00:28:20,540
it goes through a process called registration,

555
00:28:21,981 --> 00:28:23,723
and then after you register it,

556
00:28:23,823 --> 00:28:26,406
that means it's stitching all the point clouds

557
00:28:26,426 --> 00:28:29,429
that you get back together in one global coordinate system,

558
00:28:29,509 --> 00:28:31,170
so that you know where everything is

559
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,171
in relation to anything else.

560
00:28:33,192 --> 00:28:34,973
You can slice it back up into pieces

561
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:37,335
that are pieces that you might model.

562
00:28:38,355 --> 00:28:40,717
You can also stitch it together into multiple bits

563
00:28:40,857 --> 00:28:42,978
and then make it so that you can move pieces around

564
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:44,719
if you want to take a little artistic license.

565
00:28:44,979 --> 00:28:46,680
And so this is really useful for blocking out

566
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:49,522
fake environments, other things that you might do.

567
00:28:49,842 --> 00:28:52,124
And so we kind of stumbled on laser scanning

568
00:28:52,444 --> 00:28:55,145
in an interesting state of events.

569
00:28:55,466 --> 00:28:57,867
So one day we had a vendor come by

570
00:28:57,927 --> 00:28:59,968
to show us the state of the art in laser scanning

571
00:29:00,048 --> 00:29:01,609
for objects like a car.

572
00:29:03,265 --> 00:29:08,230
And so these particular vendors accidentally set the vendor to scan everything except the car.

573
00:29:08,711 --> 00:29:14,357
So they set it off and it was going and then at the end we were like, man, this is taking forever, this sucks.

574
00:29:14,717 --> 00:29:17,680
And then they pulled up the data and they were looking at each other going like...

575
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:18,721
well, where's the car?

576
00:29:19,221 --> 00:29:22,103
And then so, while they were puzzling over

577
00:29:22,143 --> 00:29:25,144
their incompetence, I was taking a look at the data,

578
00:29:25,424 --> 00:29:26,905
and I realized that they had picked up

579
00:29:26,945 --> 00:29:30,187
the entire parking garage where we were taking this reference

580
00:29:30,607 --> 00:29:32,368
and including the stairwell that was like

581
00:29:32,548 --> 00:29:33,469
hundreds of feet away.

582
00:29:33,489 --> 00:29:35,710
I'm like, I can see the stairs and everything.

583
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:37,971
And so, we chased those guys away

584
00:29:38,031 --> 00:29:40,733
because they were not fitting the bill for what we needed,

585
00:29:40,993 --> 00:29:42,754
but it really planted a seed in our heads

586
00:29:42,854 --> 00:29:46,656
for when we started our reference gathering process on Prague.

587
00:29:47,437 --> 00:29:50,999
So, when we sat down and we had a little breathing room

588
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:53,621
after we shipped four, we were taking a look

589
00:29:53,642 --> 00:29:55,323
at the state of the art in surveying

590
00:29:55,463 --> 00:29:56,884
and laser scanning and LIDAR

591
00:29:56,944 --> 00:29:58,245
and all that technology around there.

592
00:29:58,705 --> 00:30:01,107
And we were pleased to find that there was a number

593
00:30:01,227 --> 00:30:04,350
of financially accessible options to us

594
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:09,254
and that there are techniques to scan like miles of area

595
00:30:09,354 --> 00:30:10,935
with sub-centimeter accuracy.

596
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:17,583
And that was really surprising to us, because we didn't subscribe to any surveying magazines

597
00:30:17,663 --> 00:30:21,105
or go to oil drilling conventions where they use this a lot.

598
00:30:21,405 --> 00:30:24,527
And so it was cool to see how much that's evolved.

599
00:30:25,068 --> 00:30:29,070
I'm going to talk in more detail about it, so you guys can hopefully be equally as impressed

600
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:29,791
about what we can do.

601
00:30:31,738 --> 00:30:35,323
It's really fun to say laser scanning, we should do laser scanning for our tracks.

602
00:30:35,663 --> 00:30:43,814
But in practice, it's really difficult to go from that phrase to trying to make it accessible and usable by the artists back at our studio.

603
00:30:44,695 --> 00:30:47,759
So, I'm going to go into detail about each of those.

604
00:30:49,318 --> 00:30:51,960
Okay, so this is us chillin' in Prague,

605
00:30:52,961 --> 00:30:54,562
and we are in Old Town Square,

606
00:30:54,962 --> 00:30:57,164
and this is what the laser scanner looks like that we used.

607
00:30:57,784 --> 00:31:00,466
So, nobody's around because we were scared

608
00:31:00,506 --> 00:31:02,247
of carrying a laser kind of device

609
00:31:02,347 --> 00:31:03,868
around Eastern European police,

610
00:31:04,328 --> 00:31:06,730
and so we would get up at two to four a.m.

611
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,632
and go out and take pictures of big landmarks like this

612
00:31:10,172 --> 00:31:10,993
with nobody around,

613
00:31:11,233 --> 00:31:13,354
and it really helped our reference gathering process.

614
00:31:14,344 --> 00:31:18,488
So, you set this guy up, you set it on for a few scans,

615
00:31:18,768 --> 00:31:21,611
you choose some key locations, and at the end,

616
00:31:22,973 --> 00:31:25,075
you stitch it together and you get something like this.

617
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:28,138
And so, this is a screenshot of some

618
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:30,240
pricey serving software that is out there

619
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,341
for processing point clouds.

620
00:31:31,721 --> 00:31:35,944
So this is pricey enough and they use opposite axes

621
00:31:36,024 --> 00:31:38,486
and their navigation is completely opposite

622
00:31:38,606 --> 00:31:39,686
of what our artists want to do.

623
00:31:39,987 --> 00:31:42,628
And so for that reason, we couldn't buy this software

624
00:31:42,648 --> 00:31:44,309
and place it on all our artists' desks

625
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:47,071
and we wanted to integrate it into their tool set.

626
00:31:47,532 --> 00:31:49,473
So one of the biggest hurdles we had

627
00:31:49,773 --> 00:31:52,375
was to try and figure out how our artists could use this

628
00:31:52,515 --> 00:31:55,217
in actual practice to help their production process.

629
00:31:57,856 --> 00:32:00,418
Luckily, around this time when we were poking around,

630
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:03,880
we discovered that Autodesk was pursuing some opportunities

631
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,722
in the area of point cloud capture and processing.

632
00:32:07,162 --> 00:32:10,044
And so, we actually contracted with their

633
00:32:10,344 --> 00:32:12,846
custom consulting group and decided to work together

634
00:32:13,006 --> 00:32:13,446
on something.

635
00:32:13,967 --> 00:32:17,850
And so what we ended up with was a special implementation

636
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:19,931
that would allow us to have a plug-in

637
00:32:20,191 --> 00:32:22,613
that would load up the laser scan point clouds

638
00:32:22,853 --> 00:32:24,114
inside of 3D Studio Max,

639
00:32:24,194 --> 00:32:25,595
which is what we use in our pipeline,

640
00:32:26,116 --> 00:32:28,457
and let the artists actually take chunks of this

641
00:32:28,778 --> 00:32:30,359
and just load it up directly in their tool.

642
00:32:30,639 --> 00:32:31,840
And you can vertex snap to it,

643
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,442
so you can real quickly lay out a block of a building

644
00:32:34,942 --> 00:32:37,084
and just see exactly what it's looking like.

645
00:32:37,524 --> 00:32:40,789
And so, thanks to the deep pockets of my studio,

646
00:32:42,091 --> 00:32:44,715
Autodesk has released this funded project into the wild

647
00:32:44,795 --> 00:32:47,680
with a free extension pack to 3ds Max 2014,

648
00:32:48,361 --> 00:32:50,985
and it's also built into Max 2015,

649
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:52,627
which was announced yesterday here.

650
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,541
So this is equally as accessible to you guys now.

651
00:32:57,841 --> 00:33:01,002
So we also worked with Autodesk to get some early versions

652
00:33:01,282 --> 00:33:03,082
of some software that they've now released

653
00:33:03,122 --> 00:33:05,623
into the wild as well called Reality Capture or ReCap.

654
00:33:06,303 --> 00:33:10,944
And so using that software, you can take these point clouds

655
00:33:10,964 --> 00:33:13,424
that we load up in 3DS Max and kind of slice them

656
00:33:13,464 --> 00:33:16,125
and dice them however you want, create chunks out of it,

657
00:33:16,405 --> 00:33:19,305
delete some points, just block it out to however you want

658
00:33:19,365 --> 00:33:20,665
and then end up with discrete chunks

659
00:33:20,805 --> 00:33:22,486
that you can bring into 3D Studio Max.

660
00:33:23,366 --> 00:33:28,892
So after we process this, like after the registration process in the laser scanning surveying software,

661
00:33:29,493 --> 00:33:33,677
after we slice it up using ReCap, we can bring it into 3D Studio Max.

662
00:33:34,198 --> 00:33:37,641
And I'm going to play a quick video here to show you what it looks like to our artists.

663
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:41,065
So here's some chunks from that scan from the Prague Old Town Square.

664
00:33:42,774 --> 00:33:43,735
I'm gonna play it.

665
00:33:43,975 --> 00:33:46,417
So we can chop this up and now we can take

666
00:33:46,457 --> 00:33:48,638
some artistic liberties so that we can make

667
00:33:48,658 --> 00:33:52,061
the Old Town Square funner to cruise a supercar through.

668
00:33:53,381 --> 00:33:56,343
So we try and make it a funner to drive Old Town Square.

669
00:33:56,423 --> 00:33:59,065
So we're taking chunks of the buildings, moving it.

670
00:33:59,325 --> 00:34:00,626
So you can see how this might apply

671
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:02,027
to a fictional kind of area.

672
00:34:02,087 --> 00:34:05,229
If you take scans of like cliffs or terrain or something,

673
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:07,531
you can actually piece together a compelling environment

674
00:34:07,771 --> 00:34:10,293
and see it in pretty realistic 3D

675
00:34:10,433 --> 00:34:11,954
and it's all fast and interactive.

676
00:34:12,334 --> 00:34:14,796
And so, real quickly here, we can block out

677
00:34:16,197 --> 00:34:18,718
what a potential design for this area might look like

678
00:34:18,818 --> 00:34:20,499
after we've taken our artistic liberties.

679
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,922
So, here's another view of the chunks pieced together

680
00:34:25,143 --> 00:34:27,224
in the end after we did a little rearrangement.

681
00:34:28,245 --> 00:34:30,366
This is blocking out the entrance to the Old Town Square

682
00:34:30,426 --> 00:34:32,167
for our Prague circuit that actually ended up

683
00:34:32,187 --> 00:34:32,767
shipping in the game.

684
00:34:33,641 --> 00:34:36,542
So once we arrange this inside 3D Studio Max,

685
00:34:37,162 --> 00:34:39,223
and again, this is all like full detail,

686
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,724
like you can zoom in to the detail of the windows

687
00:34:41,844 --> 00:34:45,845
and get the exact ornate decoration that was on it,

688
00:34:46,006 --> 00:34:48,366
and should you choose to, you can model it as well.

689
00:34:49,811 --> 00:34:52,332
So, after that it's a matter of turning the production crank.

690
00:34:52,672 --> 00:34:54,693
We have a lot of environment artists at Turn 10.

691
00:34:55,854 --> 00:34:57,615
They eventually build this set of meshes,

692
00:34:58,115 --> 00:35:00,376
and it ultimately looks like this in our game

693
00:35:00,476 --> 00:35:04,178
with the lighting AO debug mode turned on.

694
00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:07,780
So, that's what we ended up actually getting into

695
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:08,401
with our ship game.

696
00:35:09,882 --> 00:35:13,383
All right, so now a quick few bullet points

697
00:35:13,504 --> 00:35:16,645
to wrap up this tour of our reference bits.

698
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,361
So, savings.

699
00:35:20,741 --> 00:35:23,502
We found that going through this process,

700
00:35:23,742 --> 00:35:26,762
I actually had to write all this business justification

701
00:35:26,842 --> 00:35:28,963
and budgeting projections and all that to say like,

702
00:35:29,203 --> 00:35:31,784
hey, we wanna spend like tens of thousands of dollars

703
00:35:31,864 --> 00:35:34,884
on laser scanning and it's gonna improve our processes.

704
00:35:35,064 --> 00:35:36,145
So I kind of had to prove that out

705
00:35:36,185 --> 00:35:37,065
before we spent the money.

706
00:35:38,585 --> 00:35:39,886
We found that in the end,

707
00:35:40,126 --> 00:35:41,946
we've significantly decreased the time it takes

708
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:43,626
to create those early rough phases

709
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:45,307
of our environment production

710
00:35:45,787 --> 00:35:46,827
using some of these techniques here.

711
00:35:48,972 --> 00:35:51,295
We ended up saving, I don't have the exact number here,

712
00:35:51,395 --> 00:35:54,538
so I'll just summarize it as,

713
00:35:54,738 --> 00:35:57,580
we saved hundreds of dollars of money during these phases,

714
00:35:57,861 --> 00:35:59,222
balancing this reference gathering

715
00:35:59,482 --> 00:36:01,484
with the time that it took artists to sit around

716
00:36:01,564 --> 00:36:03,326
and be like, well, I don't know,

717
00:36:03,366 --> 00:36:04,867
I'm just gonna make this random building here,

718
00:36:05,087 --> 00:36:06,148
and then having people look at it

719
00:36:06,168 --> 00:36:07,770
and comparing it to images and say like,

720
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:09,552
well, it's not actually there, it's over here,

721
00:36:09,812 --> 00:36:11,153
and all the adjustments that that takes.

722
00:36:11,534 --> 00:36:13,956
So it's been a huge dollar savings for us.

723
00:36:15,442 --> 00:36:17,803
We also got faster initial iteration

724
00:36:17,883 --> 00:36:19,324
on the look and feel of our environments.

725
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:22,185
So you could see in the scans that we had,

726
00:36:22,365 --> 00:36:23,686
even inside 3D Studio Max,

727
00:36:24,387 --> 00:36:26,528
you could really get a feel for the environment,

728
00:36:26,728 --> 00:36:29,249
like way before we ever generate models

729
00:36:29,329 --> 00:36:31,050
and get anything really useful out of it.

730
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:33,892
So it actually resulted in less design changes

731
00:36:34,132 --> 00:36:37,814
after we really wanted to have things baked down.

732
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:46,472
And then ultimately this led to a lot less quality and plausibility bugs during when we were trying to shut down the track and

733
00:36:47,152 --> 00:36:52,254
For for our QA team and our test team to identify like things that are wrong

734
00:36:52,374 --> 00:36:56,916
Like we have a whole team of people that sit there and look at stuff after the fact and go like this sucks

735
00:36:56,956 --> 00:37:01,398
This is wrong. And like we got rid of a lot of that follow-up action

736
00:37:03,923 --> 00:37:08,745
Alright, so I wanted to have a quick slide on the lessons and application in case you

737
00:37:08,765 --> 00:37:10,265
choose to venture down something like this.

738
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:13,086
So investing in this was not easy or cheap.

739
00:37:14,766 --> 00:37:20,368
We actually spent some significant spend on this and it was really tough to justify.

740
00:37:20,388 --> 00:37:26,130
A lot of it came down to somewhat hand-waving because like you can't really say, well, you

741
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:26,250
know...

742
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:29,651
what amount of time is an artist like sitting there twiddling their thumbs

743
00:37:29,992 --> 00:37:32,993
before it gets to a place where they can actually start producing content.

744
00:37:33,413 --> 00:37:36,135
And it's not something the studio management really wants to hear.

745
00:37:36,515 --> 00:37:40,877
And so it was tough to get over that initial hurdle of saying like,

746
00:37:41,418 --> 00:37:46,981
we want to actually invest in reference gathering because it's so unsexy and it's not like, well,

747
00:37:47,461 --> 00:37:50,563
you know, they're not building the track at that time, so why is that important?

748
00:37:52,043 --> 00:37:55,228
So the cost actually ended up being pretty reasonable for what we get out of it,

749
00:37:55,508 --> 00:37:59,133
and our production savings here ultimately proved to be really worthwhile.

750
00:38:00,753 --> 00:38:02,875
We had a big accessibility struggle for artists.

751
00:38:03,236 --> 00:38:05,298
I'll touch on that a little bit more in my next slide.

752
00:38:06,138 --> 00:38:09,101
But it was really tough for us to figure out like,

753
00:38:09,321 --> 00:38:11,504
well, here's a cool tech, and here's how we map it

754
00:38:11,544 --> 00:38:13,786
to something that is useful actually in production.

755
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:17,349
And then ultimately, we ended up with a large,

756
00:38:17,749 --> 00:38:19,831
much larger data footprint than we ever had

757
00:38:19,872 --> 00:38:21,353
for any reference gathering trips before.

758
00:38:22,452 --> 00:38:24,813
So, where is this going?

759
00:38:24,973 --> 00:38:25,554
What's the future?

760
00:38:26,074 --> 00:38:28,315
We're in the early stages of all these

761
00:38:28,355 --> 00:38:30,216
really cool techniques for trying to really

762
00:38:30,636 --> 00:38:33,618
quickly pick up what reference actually looks like.

763
00:38:34,138 --> 00:38:37,179
So, I have a slide here showing that the future is crap.

764
00:38:41,825 --> 00:38:45,866
in no particular order except for it is an anagram for crap.

765
00:38:47,267 --> 00:38:49,048
Here's where some of the future I see

766
00:38:49,248 --> 00:38:51,109
of reference gathering is coming from.

767
00:38:51,469 --> 00:38:52,989
So, costs are gonna come down.

768
00:38:53,069 --> 00:38:55,510
Like we see day to day in everything that we do,

769
00:38:56,531 --> 00:38:58,812
the technology that is seemingly inaccessible

770
00:38:58,852 --> 00:39:00,352
at the beginning becomes cheaper.

771
00:39:00,472 --> 00:39:02,713
And so, we were actually surprised, we were like.

772
00:39:03,134 --> 00:39:05,456
oh, what if we bought our own laser scanner

773
00:39:05,496 --> 00:39:06,537
so we could carry it around?

774
00:39:07,498 --> 00:39:09,821
And it was actually a thing where we were like,

775
00:39:09,841 --> 00:39:10,782
well, we could go either way.

776
00:39:10,842 --> 00:39:12,524
We could actually partner with a service

777
00:39:12,744 --> 00:39:14,506
or actually do something like that.

778
00:39:14,867 --> 00:39:16,548
So I see costs continuing to drop,

779
00:39:16,789 --> 00:39:18,631
and so that's going to be really good for us

780
00:39:18,671 --> 00:39:21,053
trying to get a good start on our 3D environments.

781
00:39:22,594 --> 00:39:23,875
Recognition of data features.

782
00:39:24,275 --> 00:39:26,196
So, we end up with a lot of point clouds

783
00:39:26,236 --> 00:39:28,437
and we can process it to make normal maps

784
00:39:28,477 --> 00:39:29,777
and texture maps and things like that.

785
00:39:30,077 --> 00:39:31,958
But ultimately what's gonna be really handy

786
00:39:32,238 --> 00:39:34,319
is if we could take that and we could press a button

787
00:39:34,659 --> 00:39:36,519
and it would divide up into all these pieces,

788
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,060
like here's a building, here's a tree.

789
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:40,821
And so the recognition of that data,

790
00:39:41,041 --> 00:39:42,822
there's a lot of people in academia and research

791
00:39:42,842 --> 00:39:44,162
who are working on that kind of problem.

792
00:39:44,522 --> 00:39:46,263
And so that would really help us as well

793
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:48,224
if we didn't actually have to get down

794
00:39:48,304 --> 00:39:50,605
to trying to model things after.

795
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:53,385
like a template, a point cloud data,

796
00:39:53,565 --> 00:39:55,886
or something else that is just like slightly

797
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:58,107
out of reach for the artist.

798
00:39:59,127 --> 00:40:01,788
Accessibility is something I wanted to point out as well.

799
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:04,929
So some of this hardware and software

800
00:40:04,989 --> 00:40:05,949
is not really accessible.

801
00:40:06,409 --> 00:40:08,510
I talked a little before about the serving software.

802
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:09,990
Like it was impossible to use,

803
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:12,791
and like I still get confused now

804
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:15,832
from my post-traumatic stress of using that software,

805
00:40:15,852 --> 00:40:17,972
because like I don't know which mouse button tumbles

806
00:40:18,052 --> 00:40:19,132
and which one goes up and down.

807
00:40:20,533 --> 00:40:24,274
The hardware, a lot of it, like the ladybug camera, uses firewire.

808
00:40:24,575 --> 00:40:28,336
And, like, you're hard-pressed to find a laptop that has that built in.

809
00:40:28,616 --> 00:40:30,097
There's all these wires standing around.

810
00:40:30,157 --> 00:40:33,738
And so, especially when you're in a foreign land, like walking around Prague,

811
00:40:33,958 --> 00:40:36,640
and you have a backpack with, like, all these wires sticking out and everything,

812
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,241
like, you look like you're up to some sketchy business.

813
00:40:39,761 --> 00:40:44,203
And so, I see it becoming a lot more, a lot more...

814
00:40:46,295 --> 00:40:53,098
easy to use, ultimately. Portability is the next big thing. I look at the reference

815
00:40:53,138 --> 00:40:56,879
gathering that we did for Forza 5 and I'm like, well, how come GoPro doesn't build

816
00:40:56,899 --> 00:40:59,981
something sweet like this where I can just like mount it on a helmet and walk around

817
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:01,301
and look a little less suspicious?

818
00:41:02,899 --> 00:41:10,201
And so I think with all the iPhone apps and Windows Store apps and Android kinds of things that we have on our phone,

819
00:41:10,541 --> 00:41:14,922
a lot of this 360 capture, and you're beginning to see it in some of the released apps that are out there,

820
00:41:15,142 --> 00:41:21,424
the ability to stitch together a bunch of pictures, do some photogrammetry basics, to create point clouds from that,

821
00:41:21,644 --> 00:41:24,725
and just to capture something, I think that's going to become more and more prevalent.

822
00:41:25,545 --> 00:41:28,589
And the last thing that I wanted to end on is Prometheus.

823
00:41:28,889 --> 00:41:31,493
So I didn't want to get this huge lawsuit on me,

824
00:41:31,513 --> 00:41:34,517
because Microsoft is concerned about my slides getting sued.

825
00:41:34,937 --> 00:41:39,303
And so I thought I would quickly paint up

826
00:41:39,443 --> 00:41:41,105
the scene I'm talking about from Prometheus.

827
00:41:41,485 --> 00:41:46,947
So in Prometheus, there's a scene where these guys land on this alien planet, and they're like,

828
00:41:47,127 --> 00:41:48,608
well, who knows what's in these caves, right?

829
00:41:48,848 --> 00:41:53,490
So they unbox this thing, and they have these laser flying drones that they take,

830
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:58,792
and they toss up in the middle of the cave, and they fly down the cave,

831
00:41:58,852 --> 00:42:01,313
and in real time, they're getting this 3D model built.

832
00:42:01,693 --> 00:42:03,253
And so I was watching that movie, and I'm like...

833
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:05,575
What? Where is that?

834
00:42:05,976 --> 00:42:06,516
That's ultimate.

835
00:42:06,697 --> 00:42:08,979
And if you think about it, we aren't that far from that kind of future.

836
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:14,205
Because we're at a place where Amazon is talking about flying drones to deliver some of the stuff,

837
00:42:14,245 --> 00:42:17,869
and you see that in all the quadcopters and all the stuff that you see floating around.

838
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:22,534
And then laser scanning, as I mentioned, is pretty accessible, and there's a lot of stuff coming.

839
00:42:22,835 --> 00:42:25,318
So I see this Prometheus future.

840
00:42:25,938 --> 00:42:28,340
as a way like we can quickly go to a place.

841
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:31,543
Even our Halo team visited Iceland

842
00:42:31,663 --> 00:42:33,564
and did all this other stuff to try and capture

843
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:35,526
a completely sci-fi fake environment.

844
00:42:35,826 --> 00:42:37,868
And they can go out and take reference like this

845
00:42:38,268 --> 00:42:40,109
and using some of the tools that I showed earlier,

846
00:42:40,329 --> 00:42:41,811
be able to snip it up into pieces,

847
00:42:42,131 --> 00:42:44,653
stitch it together and real quickly build up a 3D model.

848
00:42:45,594 --> 00:42:49,036
So this is my commemorative GDC 2014 painting.

849
00:42:50,597 --> 00:42:53,639
And hopefully you'll have seen from this talk

850
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:55,740
that we aren't that distant from this kind of vision

851
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:58,702
and hopefully we can all progress collectively

852
00:42:59,522 --> 00:43:01,564
and move forward in terms of our reference gathering

853
00:43:01,804 --> 00:43:03,985
so that that becomes not a piece that is like

854
00:43:04,245 --> 00:43:05,946
special to Turn 10 or a studio

855
00:43:06,046 --> 00:43:08,528
because it's not a piece that anyone really wants to own.

856
00:43:09,469 --> 00:43:10,709
It's a piece that is fundamental

857
00:43:10,809 --> 00:43:12,130
in us building our 3D worlds.

858
00:43:13,391 --> 00:43:16,412
That brings me to the end and I will be glad to take any questions.

859
00:43:18,212 --> 00:43:22,633
Thanks.

860
00:43:28,055 --> 00:43:29,455
There's a guy moseying up so...

861
00:43:29,475 --> 00:43:31,996
Cool stuff.

862
00:43:32,396 --> 00:43:32,596
Thanks.

863
00:43:32,616 --> 00:43:35,977
I was wondering if you looked into automating low-poly...

864
00:43:36,628 --> 00:43:38,270
generation from your point cloud data

865
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:40,992
to get quick prototypes up and running

866
00:43:41,052 --> 00:43:44,376
and a second to that, projecting color data onto that

867
00:43:44,856 --> 00:43:47,619
so that you can take your data really quickly into the engine.

868
00:43:48,198 --> 00:43:52,602
Yeah, that's definitely one of the pieces that we're interested in and pursuing.

869
00:43:52,902 --> 00:43:55,685
So, there is some stuff that is out there.

870
00:43:56,746 --> 00:44:00,870
Our gauge of the state of the industry is it's not completely there yet.

871
00:44:01,251 --> 00:44:05,335
So, there's pieces, there's a lot of point cloud stitching kinds of things,

872
00:44:05,415 --> 00:44:07,056
and again, they're not really that accessible.

873
00:44:07,096 --> 00:44:11,661
Like, you can poke around and, like, you'll see ten types of tools that are out there that...

874
00:44:12,061 --> 00:44:17,506
create low res meshes or high res meshes from an area, but you have to take it through all

875
00:44:17,546 --> 00:44:23,291
these different tools. And then we've actually been looking at a tool recently that has power

876
00:44:23,331 --> 00:44:27,534
line extraction from a point cloud. So you can import a point cloud and then it'll be like,

877
00:44:27,614 --> 00:44:31,397
well, here's the power line and it kind of builds it together for you. And we're like, well,

878
00:44:31,437 --> 00:44:31,698
that's not...

879
00:44:31,998 --> 00:44:35,060
very useful for us and we don't want to pay like 10,000 for that privilege.

880
00:44:36,121 --> 00:44:39,203
But like, that's one of the things I was mentioning about accessibility.

881
00:44:39,344 --> 00:44:42,126
I think there's gonna be more and more tools like Autodesk is going in interesting

882
00:44:42,166 --> 00:44:43,767
directions with their point cloud data

883
00:44:44,067 --> 00:44:47,090
and I really want to get to a point where we can be like, well,

884
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:51,573
this is a tree, so make a low-res tree so I can just block it into the game.

885
00:44:52,434 --> 00:44:55,616
We haven't seen anything that is exactly there, but if anyone has a product

886
00:44:55,636 --> 00:44:57,518
that's like that, like please come talk to me afterwards.

887
00:44:59,424 --> 00:45:00,806
Hey, I might have just missed that,

888
00:45:00,846 --> 00:45:04,630
but what particular laser scanner did you guys use?

889
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:07,794
This one in particular is a laser scanner

890
00:45:07,834 --> 00:45:09,956
from a company called Leica, L-E-I-C-A.

891
00:45:10,697 --> 00:45:12,799
There's a ton of alternatives out there,

892
00:45:12,859 --> 00:45:14,481
so I don't want to be a pitch man for them.

893
00:45:15,182 --> 00:45:18,426
But it did have accuracy and kind of the time constraints

894
00:45:18,446 --> 00:45:19,247
that we were interested in.

895
00:45:22,542 --> 00:45:27,046
Did the ladybug camera and the laser scanning completely replace your need for photos?

896
00:45:27,426 --> 00:45:32,670
And if not, did you have any way to link those photos back to those videos and scans?

897
00:45:33,294 --> 00:45:34,275
All right, yeah, good question.

898
00:45:35,296 --> 00:45:37,558
No, it did not completely replace our need for photos.

899
00:45:37,718 --> 00:45:39,881
So there's a specific need for photos, which

900
00:45:39,941 --> 00:45:41,162
is to gather texture reference.

901
00:45:41,442 --> 00:45:43,124
So once we take some of this, we might

902
00:45:43,144 --> 00:45:46,467
want to have like, here's a proggish brick texture.

903
00:45:47,148 --> 00:45:48,589
Here's some cobblestone that was on there.

904
00:45:48,889 --> 00:45:51,272
And that's what was really important for us to capture

905
00:45:51,372 --> 00:45:53,093
and to be able to use as texture reference

906
00:45:53,133 --> 00:45:54,314
and cut it up how we want.

907
00:45:54,615 --> 00:45:58,857
And so like the laser scanning and the ladybug camera was pretty low-res in what we showed.

908
00:45:58,897 --> 00:46:02,699
Like it's actually HD, but by the time you split it out across all those cameras,

909
00:46:02,959 --> 00:46:05,221
like you end up getting something a little muddier than we prefer.

910
00:46:06,902 --> 00:46:09,043
And so it doesn't completely replace it.

911
00:46:09,223 --> 00:46:11,004
So yes, we still have the need for photos.

912
00:46:11,344 --> 00:46:15,526
And then your second part of your question was how do you relate that back to the 3D source?

913
00:46:15,947 --> 00:46:20,710
So, um, there's a lot of stuff, like, um, on my phone, when I take photos, it kind of

914
00:46:20,770 --> 00:46:25,314
comes with a GPS tag and I can actually look at my photos on a map and see kind of where

915
00:46:25,354 --> 00:46:29,257
I've been. Um, so, we were real excited about that technology and we're like, what if we

916
00:46:29,297 --> 00:46:33,260
took these and with like a GPS bit, uh, we could stitch it back together on our laser

917
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:36,882
scan and like have this awesome, like, big data. Um...

918
00:46:38,163 --> 00:46:40,903
it ends up not being very usable, that kind of vision.

919
00:46:41,104 --> 00:46:43,064
So we've tried a bunch of hardware

920
00:46:43,144 --> 00:46:45,484
where you have a little card that slides into your camera

921
00:46:45,905 --> 00:46:48,045
and it takes GPS readings and stamps it on

922
00:46:48,805 --> 00:46:49,985
as metadata into your pictures.

923
00:46:50,986 --> 00:46:53,226
So the thing that they don't really tell you about that

924
00:46:53,366 --> 00:46:55,146
is it takes a while to acquire that signal.

925
00:46:55,406 --> 00:46:57,447
And so if you're standing in the middle of Australia

926
00:46:57,567 --> 00:46:59,547
trying to capture Bathurst,

927
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:01,568
you could be sitting there for five to 10 minutes

928
00:47:01,908 --> 00:47:02,928
waiting to take a picture

929
00:47:03,168 --> 00:47:05,028
because you're waiting to acquire accuracy.

930
00:47:06,069 --> 00:47:10,194
If you take your handy phone and do that, it gets rid of the accuracy.

931
00:47:10,274 --> 00:47:17,883
So I did that for some of the photos that we were taking, and then some random photos will end up being in the middle of Indianapolis.

932
00:47:18,124 --> 00:47:20,747
And you're like, well, it doesn't have the real accuracy that we need.

933
00:47:23,570 --> 00:47:28,812
I think there's some of the new Canons and Nikons have some GPS built in.

934
00:47:29,452 --> 00:47:33,154
And so, again, it's something that it wasn't there for us at the beginning of 425.

935
00:47:33,714 --> 00:47:35,835
It continues to evolve, so we'll look into it.

936
00:47:35,895 --> 00:47:39,897
But yes, the dream is to, hey, let's go on a reference trip.

937
00:47:40,777 --> 00:47:45,740
It's easy to do, and you come back and you have exact photo reference, laser scan reference,

938
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,841
video, and it's all, like, stitched together in one intuitive interface.

939
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:51,071
Yep.

940
00:47:52,331 --> 00:47:52,511
Jeff.

941
00:47:53,211 --> 00:47:55,552
Some notable tracks from the history of Forza,

942
00:47:56,472 --> 00:47:59,253
Maple Valley, my favorite, are gone now.

943
00:47:59,413 --> 00:48:00,653
And the thing is that Maple Valley

944
00:48:00,693 --> 00:48:02,974
has no real world location it's based off of.

945
00:48:03,474 --> 00:48:06,794
Is it missing now because your production pipeline has

946
00:48:06,854 --> 00:48:09,395
gone this route where you have to have a real world

947
00:48:09,495 --> 00:48:11,035
analog to get the source material,

948
00:48:11,115 --> 00:48:13,156
or is it missing for other reasons?

949
00:48:14,508 --> 00:48:15,889
It is missing for other reasons.

950
00:48:16,409 --> 00:48:19,150
There are quite a few tracks that we plan to resurrect

951
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:21,971
and to build up to the quality level that it would take.

952
00:48:22,931 --> 00:48:24,492
As you guys know, in game development,

953
00:48:24,752 --> 00:48:26,873
you can't always hit the desired targets

954
00:48:27,633 --> 00:48:28,614
of everything that you would want

955
00:48:28,634 --> 00:48:29,514
to possibly have in a game.

956
00:48:29,874 --> 00:48:32,037
And so when we're at a place where we can say,

957
00:48:32,297 --> 00:48:35,100
well, here's a, our content looks like

958
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:37,082
we're gonna be able to build 15 tracks.

959
00:48:38,103 --> 00:48:40,165
These are the tracks for the design considerations

960
00:48:40,445 --> 00:48:43,248
and the thought was like, you know,

961
00:48:43,348 --> 00:48:45,170
one of the things behind porting something like that

962
00:48:45,251 --> 00:48:46,672
and bringing it up to the current spec

963
00:48:46,792 --> 00:48:48,474
would take too long for the time that we had.

964
00:48:48,774 --> 00:48:51,995
And so I think you'll see, and we've already started

965
00:48:52,015 --> 00:48:54,655
the process of kind of resurrecting some of the other tracks

966
00:48:54,795 --> 00:48:57,456
and providing it as free content as time goes on.

967
00:48:57,816 --> 00:49:00,697
So you'll see us slowly bring stuff back up to spec.

968
00:49:01,017 --> 00:49:02,257
And for something like Maple Valley,

969
00:49:02,577 --> 00:49:04,298
it is based on a real world location,

970
00:49:04,418 --> 00:49:06,018
and we sent people there to kind of

971
00:49:06,538 --> 00:49:07,438
gather some of the reference.

972
00:49:07,738 --> 00:49:10,999
And so we would want to send people and capture

973
00:49:11,259 --> 00:49:13,780
using the methods that we had and piece together something

974
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:16,801
kind of on a more creative license

975
00:49:19,002 --> 00:49:24,254
formula more than we did on Prague, and so there'd be a lot more creativity and design laid out for it.

976
00:49:24,514 --> 00:49:26,639
But we would use some of the similar techniques for sure.

977
00:49:28,904 --> 00:49:29,064
Yes.

978
00:49:30,179 --> 00:49:31,019
Hi.

979
00:49:31,059 --> 00:49:34,560
When you take reference pictures in a city, for example,

980
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:38,240
and it's sunny, then you get plenty of spots

981
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,261
in your photos with shadows.

982
00:49:41,041 --> 00:49:44,421
And then your pictures become more or less unusable

983
00:49:44,702 --> 00:49:45,242
because of that.

984
00:49:45,262 --> 00:49:47,442
You can use it as an albedo texture.

985
00:49:47,882 --> 00:49:49,702
So was it a problem for you?

986
00:49:49,802 --> 00:49:51,783
And if so, how did you work around it?

987
00:49:52,523 --> 00:49:54,043
Well, so Microsoft has a lot of money.

988
00:49:54,123 --> 00:49:56,143
So we actually seed the clouds before we

989
00:49:56,183 --> 00:49:57,124
go on a reference trip.

990
00:49:57,284 --> 00:49:58,944
And there's no sun when we go.

991
00:49:58,964 --> 00:49:59,024
Yes.

992
00:50:00,092 --> 00:50:05,358
Now, um, so for, for sunny, sunny days, um, is obviously a consideration.

993
00:50:05,658 --> 00:50:09,162
Um, there's actually a lot, um, some software out there now that, um, does a pretty good

994
00:50:09,182 --> 00:50:10,304
job at removing lighting.

995
00:50:10,904 --> 00:50:15,049
Um, and so, uh, I guess I won't go into specifics because I don't want to be a pitch man for

996
00:50:15,089 --> 00:50:15,850
any specific thing.

997
00:50:16,070 --> 00:50:17,311
But there's software out there.

998
00:50:17,852 --> 00:50:21,517
that we have used and that we continue to look at,

999
00:50:22,418 --> 00:50:26,283
which will let you take sunny photographs and identify an area of shadow and sun,

1000
00:50:26,423 --> 00:50:31,049
and it will automatically, and it does a pretty reasonable job at subtracting the sunny component of it.

1001
00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:33,873
And so we did that for the most part.

1002
00:50:35,715 --> 00:50:37,536
But then that's only scalable to a little bit,

1003
00:50:37,556 --> 00:50:39,437
and sometimes there's some undesired artifacts.

1004
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:41,438
And so we will actually take it in and then

1005
00:50:41,638 --> 00:50:43,039
use some of the Macbeth chart data

1006
00:50:43,159 --> 00:50:45,740
to kind of dial it into an area that's more realistic.

1007
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:47,241
And so that was one of the reasons

1008
00:50:47,281 --> 00:50:49,002
it was really important for us to capture images

1009
00:50:49,042 --> 00:50:51,783
with a Macbeth chart, because if it's sunny on the object

1010
00:50:51,803 --> 00:50:53,884
that you're taking a picture of, it's sunny on the chart.

1011
00:50:54,104 --> 00:50:56,105
And you can kind of compensate for that,

1012
00:50:56,426 --> 00:50:58,146
even though there's going to be some slight differences.

1013
00:50:58,807 --> 00:50:59,627
OK, thank you very much.

1014
00:51:01,568 --> 00:51:02,208
Last question, I guess.

1015
00:51:03,374 --> 00:51:18,387
Yeah, I was wondering if you could just briefly describe the pipeline for the laser scanner, basically, like the data get once you do the laser scan, you know, how you get that data basically into max. Okay, yeah.

1016
00:51:18,908 --> 00:51:22,149
Yeah, so I covered it a little in a previous slide,

1017
00:51:22,189 --> 00:51:24,009
which I'll try and walk back to while I'm here.

1018
00:51:24,309 --> 00:51:26,710
But basically, the process for it is,

1019
00:51:27,510 --> 00:51:31,031
we take all those scans, and then we,

1020
00:51:31,571 --> 00:51:32,951
so this is the slide I had up on it.

1021
00:51:33,211 --> 00:51:35,372
So, we do the process of registration,

1022
00:51:35,472 --> 00:51:37,132
which is you need to stitch it up

1023
00:51:37,212 --> 00:51:38,712
into one single coordinate system,

1024
00:51:38,792 --> 00:51:41,553
so you know, even though you take 50 scans

1025
00:51:41,633 --> 00:51:43,093
because stuff was obstructed,

1026
00:51:43,874 --> 00:51:46,234
you know exactly where the top of the cathedral is

1027
00:51:46,354 --> 00:51:48,655
from this point that you were trying to take a look at.

1028
00:51:48,995 --> 00:51:54,801
And so you take all that and Serving Software lets you kind of stitch that together, and so it's all registered.

1029
00:51:55,241 --> 00:51:59,725
Then we can take each of those pieces, and we know it's correct in 3D space, and then we can start adjusting it.

1030
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:09,054
And so we use the ReCap software from Autodesk to export out RCS files, and that's freely available for people to use.

1031
00:52:09,455 --> 00:52:12,217
And so you can break it out into RCS format.

1032
00:52:12,497 --> 00:52:15,260
And then, as I mentioned before, Autodesk

1033
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:18,162
has now released in 2014, max 2014 and 2015,

1034
00:52:18,583 --> 00:52:20,765
this plugin that we paid them to make.

1035
00:52:22,166 --> 00:52:26,449
And it lets you load in those RCS files as a max object.

1036
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:28,750
And so you can bring it in, and you have a ton of clouds.

1037
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:31,671
And it does occlusion really well and decimation.

1038
00:52:31,691 --> 00:52:34,211
So you can crank it down to like 1% of the points,

1039
00:52:34,271 --> 00:52:36,371
if speed is a concern, move stuff around.

1040
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:39,512
And so we have a really kind of smoothed out pipeline

1041
00:52:39,592 --> 00:52:41,992
from when we first initially started doing this.

1042
00:52:42,253 --> 00:52:45,273
So our artists can kind of take any bits that they want,

1043
00:52:45,353 --> 00:52:47,634
load it into their Mac scene, and start

1044
00:52:47,654 --> 00:52:49,034
building a model off it.

1045
00:52:49,414 --> 00:52:50,894
And there's a couple hops in there,

1046
00:52:51,234 --> 00:52:52,694
but it's as good as it's going to get for now.

1047
00:52:55,910 --> 00:52:58,973
All right, well, if that's over, feel free to catch me

1048
00:52:59,654 --> 00:53:02,818
anywhere after the show or after today's session.

1049
00:53:03,198 --> 00:53:03,999
And thanks for coming again.
