1
00:00:05,823 --> 00:00:11,708
With that said, our next talk is Randy Smith from TigerStyle.

2
00:00:11,708 --> 00:00:15,171
With that, just going to go ahead and start.

3
00:00:15,171 --> 00:00:19,195
Thank you.

4
00:00:19,195 --> 00:00:20,156
Hi, I'm Randy.

5
00:00:20,156 --> 00:00:22,358
I'm in TigerStyle, the studio that

6
00:00:22,358 --> 00:00:24,740
made Spider, The Secret of Bryce Manor,

7
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,842
which you might have seen at last year's IGF.

8
00:00:26,842 --> 00:00:28,183
And this is my friend Rob.

9
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,991
Rob is an avid gamer. He's also a very funny and creative guy.

10
00:00:31,991 --> 00:00:34,212
And he loves the apocalypse, of course.

11
00:00:34,212 --> 00:00:35,572
So his favorite game is Fallout 3.

12
00:00:35,572 --> 00:00:37,752
This is his Fallout 3 character.

13
00:00:37,752 --> 00:00:39,533
But most of the time, his character

14
00:00:39,533 --> 00:00:40,733
doesn't look like this.

15
00:00:40,733 --> 00:00:41,753
Because if you know Fallout 3, you

16
00:00:41,753 --> 00:00:43,874
know that you can have different pieces of equipment,

17
00:00:43,874 --> 00:00:46,394
like a helmet that might give you a special ability

18
00:00:46,394 --> 00:00:48,495
or extra protection or something.

19
00:00:48,495 --> 00:00:50,535
But it also changes the way you look.

20
00:00:50,535 --> 00:00:53,236
And Rob chooses his equipment for looks.

21
00:00:53,236 --> 00:00:55,456
And so most of the time, his character actually

22
00:00:55,456 --> 00:00:55,977
looks like this.

23
00:00:56,422 --> 00:01:00,885
which is he's wearing a ghoul mask and he's got a George Washington wig on,

24
00:01:00,885 --> 00:01:04,567
although normally he sort of prefers the Abraham Lincoln top hat.

25
00:01:04,567 --> 00:01:08,770
And so Rob has completed all of the good as opposed to evil side quests in Fallout 3.

26
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:12,212
So everywhere he goes, everybody's always like praising him

27
00:01:12,212 --> 00:01:16,635
and thanking this ghoul-headed Abraham Lincoln guy.

28
00:01:16,635 --> 00:01:19,957
And at some point after he'd finished the game and all the optional content,

29
00:01:19,957 --> 00:01:22,599
Rob decided his character had gone crazy.

30
00:01:23,063 --> 00:01:25,285
looking for more good deeds to perform in the world

31
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:27,906
and thought that all the teddy bears were victims

32
00:01:27,906 --> 00:01:28,827
in need of saving.

33
00:01:28,827 --> 00:01:30,028
All these teddy bears you can find

34
00:01:30,028 --> 00:01:31,429
around the capital wasteland.

35
00:01:31,429 --> 00:01:34,031
So he would, for example, perform home invasions

36
00:01:34,031 --> 00:01:35,832
on innocent civilians to like liberate

37
00:01:35,832 --> 00:01:37,534
the teddy bear hostages.

38
00:01:37,534 --> 00:01:40,456
Ideally in a stealthy way, but if necessary,

39
00:01:40,456 --> 00:01:42,858
he would mop up the victims and, I'm sorry,

40
00:01:42,858 --> 00:01:45,860
mop up the witnesses so nobody knew what happened.

41
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,702
Here's a wonderful scenic vista Rob made

42
00:01:48,702 --> 00:01:50,103
with his teddy bears.

43
00:01:50,103 --> 00:01:51,684
Here's him chilling out with them.

44
00:01:52,088 --> 00:01:54,710
So this is what I mean when I talk about player expression.

45
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:57,152
Like there's something very uniquely raw about the way

46
00:01:57,152 --> 00:01:58,252
he's approaching Fallout 3.

47
00:01:58,252 --> 00:02:01,295
And I'm sure all of you can think of similar examples.

48
00:02:01,295 --> 00:02:03,456
To me, player expression includes

49
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,618
any time the player makes a choice

50
00:02:05,618 --> 00:02:07,999
from a range of valid options.

51
00:02:07,999 --> 00:02:10,341
So it includes stuff like customizing

52
00:02:10,341 --> 00:02:11,102
the look of your avatar.

53
00:02:11,102 --> 00:02:14,804
It includes customizing the gameplay abilities

54
00:02:14,804 --> 00:02:16,045
that your player has.

55
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:19,162
It can involve picking dialogue from a menu.

56
00:02:19,162 --> 00:02:22,723
It can involve crafting and manipulating the world.

57
00:02:22,723 --> 00:02:26,803
It also includes where you place your webs in our game Spider.

58
00:02:26,803 --> 00:02:29,044
So there's this interesting thing

59
00:02:29,044 --> 00:02:32,744
that when you take these level complete screens at the end

60
00:02:32,744 --> 00:02:37,005
of a Spider level, and you take one level but multiple players,

61
00:02:37,005 --> 00:02:40,326
and you start to overlay their level complete screens,

62
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:44,486
you notice that there are certain spots on these maps

63
00:02:44,486 --> 00:02:45,887
that every player has placed a web.

64
00:02:46,885 --> 00:02:48,806
And then there's other spots where no player has ever

65
00:02:48,806 --> 00:02:49,286
placed a web.

66
00:02:49,286 --> 00:02:51,806
But if you go to a different level in our game,

67
00:02:51,806 --> 00:02:53,167
that's not always the case.

68
00:02:53,167 --> 00:02:55,627
So in this level, for example, there's

69
00:02:55,627 --> 00:02:57,808
only one spot that every player has placed a web.

70
00:02:57,808 --> 00:02:59,828
And so this is really fascinating to me

71
00:02:59,828 --> 00:03:02,329
because it shows that player expression is the kind of thing

72
00:03:02,329 --> 00:03:05,550
that you can get a little bit of an objective measurement on,

73
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:08,570
like sort of a temperature gauge on whether your game is

74
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,411
expressive and where it might be expressive.

75
00:03:10,411 --> 00:03:12,771
So you might be sitting there wondering,

76
00:03:12,771 --> 00:03:15,172
does this have anything to do with the game I'm

77
00:03:15,172 --> 00:03:15,772
working on now?

78
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,311
And that's a bit of an overstatement.

79
00:03:19,311 --> 00:03:22,613
But I did want to bring this topic to the Indie Summit

80
00:03:22,613 --> 00:03:23,453
for a few reasons.

81
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:26,215
The first of all, unlike something

82
00:03:26,215 --> 00:03:29,516
like a big fancy renderer, player expression

83
00:03:29,516 --> 00:03:32,157
is the kind of thing that's mostly

84
00:03:32,157 --> 00:03:33,758
the output of thoughtful design.

85
00:03:33,758 --> 00:03:36,860
And it's pretty easy to implement a lot of the time.

86
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,360
So that makes it within the reach of even

87
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,621
like a modest indie studio.

88
00:03:39,621 --> 00:03:43,003
Two is, I think as an example like Minecraft shows us,

89
00:03:43,872 --> 00:03:48,996
There's a lot of, you know, I believe that player expression is an area for innovation and growth.

90
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:50,017
It's like a frontier.

91
00:03:50,017 --> 00:03:55,121
And it's hard to imagine the mainstream studios backing something risky like that, you know,

92
00:03:55,121 --> 00:03:56,942
like having been the studios that made Minecraft.

93
00:03:56,942 --> 00:04:00,545
So I feel like indies are the one who are more likely to come up with these new ideas.

94
00:04:00,545 --> 00:04:07,270
And lastly, because player expression is really close to the heart of what makes our medium unique.

95
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:11,733
This idea, you know, the promise that you can not just passively observe, but also participate in the art form.

96
00:04:11,733 --> 00:04:12,794
So how do you do it?

97
00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:15,950
I'm summarizing the approach I like with this expression,

98
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:16,831
leave enough room.

99
00:04:16,831 --> 00:04:18,952
And I'm going to break it down into three parts,

100
00:04:18,952 --> 00:04:20,373
the first of which is a don't.

101
00:04:20,373 --> 00:04:22,235
It's don't tell the player what to do.

102
00:04:22,235 --> 00:04:24,656
So what are some negative examples of cases

103
00:04:24,656 --> 00:04:26,418
where you might tell the player what to do?

104
00:04:26,418 --> 00:04:29,180
Well, obviously, there's the so-called string of pearl

105
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,782
games, which are these heavily gated, crafted, bottlenecked

106
00:04:32,782 --> 00:04:36,405
games explicitly for the purpose that every player has

107
00:04:36,405 --> 00:04:38,166
the same exact exquisite experience.

108
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,967
Obviously, that's not leaving any room

109
00:04:39,967 --> 00:04:41,008
for the player's creativity.

110
00:04:41,991 --> 00:04:45,954
Similarly, certain types of very mathematical, mechanical puzzle

111
00:04:45,954 --> 00:04:48,415
games where the whole point is that there's only one right

112
00:04:48,415 --> 00:04:50,297
answer, also not much room.

113
00:04:50,297 --> 00:04:52,538
But there's some more insidious stuff too.

114
00:04:52,538 --> 00:04:55,660
Such as in the case of Scrabble, when I first

115
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,262
started playing Scrabble, I felt like it

116
00:04:58,262 --> 00:04:59,703
must be a really expressive game,

117
00:04:59,703 --> 00:05:01,904
because you're given this random collection of letters

118
00:05:01,904 --> 00:05:02,985
and you get to make your own words.

119
00:05:02,985 --> 00:05:04,986
So it could be more expressive than that.

120
00:05:04,986 --> 00:05:06,747
But when you really get deep in Scrabble

121
00:05:06,747 --> 00:05:08,989
and you're trying to optimize for score,

122
00:05:08,989 --> 00:05:11,430
you find that you need to be proficient in words like this.

123
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:15,292
which, for example, two-letter words are important for Scrabbles

124
00:05:15,292 --> 00:05:20,034
because they give you extra flexibility so that you can place your really high-scoring tiles

125
00:05:20,034 --> 00:05:23,055
like Qs and Zs on the multiplier spaces on the board.

126
00:05:23,055 --> 00:05:27,257
And there's all these other sort of mechanical advantages to these types of words.

127
00:05:27,257 --> 00:05:31,919
But, like, you know, nobody who knows, who doesn't play Scrabble

128
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,120
has ever heard of this word OE, which is a whirlwind off the fairy islands.

129
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,222
And that includes everybody who lives on the fairy islands, wherever those are, right?

130
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,241
you wind up doing this thing that's not especially,

131
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:45,982
you know, doesn't seem like your own creativity.

132
00:05:45,982 --> 00:05:48,823
If you go look at the worldwide global leaderboards

133
00:05:48,823 --> 00:05:50,743
for Scrabble, and you check to see

134
00:05:50,743 --> 00:05:52,944
who has played the highest scoring word of all time,

135
00:05:52,944 --> 00:05:54,745
you find that there's a ton of people who

136
00:05:54,745 --> 00:05:58,526
are all tied for first place with this word, oxyfenbutazone.

137
00:05:58,526 --> 00:06:02,067
And it turns out this is the theoretical highest scoring

138
00:06:02,067 --> 00:06:04,767
possible word in Scrabble right now that they know of.

139
00:06:04,767 --> 00:06:07,728
And it actually takes a lot of game mechanical contortions

140
00:06:07,728 --> 00:06:09,349
to prove that this could ever possibly be

141
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:10,209
played in a Scrabble game.

142
00:06:10,927 --> 00:06:13,529
Leaderboards, I think, are very revealing.

143
00:06:13,529 --> 00:06:16,572
Like, you know, Mario Kart's this other example of a game

144
00:06:16,572 --> 00:06:18,634
that you get to choose lots of different characters,

145
00:06:18,634 --> 00:06:20,175
lots of different vehicles,

146
00:06:20,175 --> 00:06:22,016
but when you go look at the global leaderboards,

147
00:06:22,016 --> 00:06:24,759
you see that people who are really heavily trying

148
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,041
to optimize have a much narrower range of choice

149
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:27,541
available to them.

150
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:30,484
So, this is the problem with score, you know?

151
00:06:30,484 --> 00:06:32,585
It takes a much more open-ended experience

152
00:06:32,585 --> 00:06:34,487
and it applies this numerical judgment to it.

153
00:06:34,487 --> 00:06:37,329
And it's kind of, it's doing its job as a game design tool.

154
00:06:37,329 --> 00:06:38,770
You know, it's us telling the player

155
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:40,112
what we think is right and wrong.

156
00:06:40,512 --> 00:06:41,613
in terms of how to play our games.

157
00:06:41,613 --> 00:06:44,054
And there's some things beyond just

158
00:06:44,054 --> 00:06:46,795
like the pure numerical score that can also do this.

159
00:06:46,795 --> 00:06:48,756
Stuff like the goals and tasks and objectives

160
00:06:48,756 --> 00:06:50,237
that we give the player, especially

161
00:06:50,237 --> 00:06:52,378
when those things are connected to the player's success

162
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:53,818
and failure and progress through the game.

163
00:06:53,818 --> 00:06:56,340
So this is a good point for me to start

164
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,481
showing some of the stuff that TigerStyle is working on now.

165
00:06:58,481 --> 00:07:00,602
I just wanted to mention that it was really

166
00:07:00,602 --> 00:07:02,602
intended in sort of this academic context

167
00:07:02,602 --> 00:07:03,943
to share with our fellow developers.

168
00:07:03,943 --> 00:07:04,863
So if you're a press person, we'd

169
00:07:04,863 --> 00:07:06,124
ask that you contact us.

170
00:07:06,124 --> 00:07:08,665
We can give you some more appropriate materials.

171
00:07:08,665 --> 00:07:08,705
So.

172
00:07:09,233 --> 00:07:13,936
Our new game is, like, the concept is you're, it's the future, and you're an astronaut,

173
00:07:13,936 --> 00:07:17,957
and you're sent on this mission to Mars, but something goes horribly wrong, and you're

174
00:07:17,957 --> 00:07:20,779
trapped in this cave where you discover life on Mars.

175
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:26,041
And not only do you discover life, but you find this whole ecosystem of these exotic

176
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:29,903
alien life forms that all have, like, different strange behaviors.

177
00:07:29,903 --> 00:07:35,225
And the structure of the game is you're trapped in each area of the cave until you...

178
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:39,970
generate enough biomass to open this thing we call an airlock so you can proceed to the next area.

179
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:45,732
And so the types of activities the player might do involves, you know, throwing seeds to plants, plants,

180
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:50,233
you know, to grow new plants or like growing them with their light that they have on their head or

181
00:07:50,233 --> 00:07:51,934
like watering them as we're gonna see here.

182
00:07:51,934 --> 00:07:56,995
There's watering this plant which is then going to generate some more seeds so the plants can reproduce.

183
00:07:56,995 --> 00:08:00,977
You can feed the creatures in the world and after they've eaten they then reproduce as well.

184
00:08:02,376 --> 00:08:05,737
So the different types of things the player can do to generate

185
00:08:05,737 --> 00:08:09,838
this biomass, which then lets them proceed.

186
00:08:09,838 --> 00:08:11,498
And I'll watch a video for a second.

187
00:08:11,498 --> 00:08:17,460
So there are these activities in our game

188
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,980
that are connected to the player's progress.

189
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,681
They have to do things to proceed.

190
00:08:21,681 --> 00:08:23,821
So it's a little bit like telling the player what to do.

191
00:08:23,821 --> 00:08:25,622
So what's our approach to avoiding

192
00:08:25,622 --> 00:08:27,622
telling the player what to do?

193
00:08:27,986 --> 00:08:31,047
We're actually extending this thing that worked really well

194
00:08:31,047 --> 00:08:32,547
for us on Spider, which is essentially

195
00:08:32,547 --> 00:08:34,768
that there's a very low threshold for success.

196
00:08:34,768 --> 00:08:38,449
Like the player, in this case, doesn't

197
00:08:38,449 --> 00:08:41,650
have to grow much biomass in order for the airlock to open.

198
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:44,871
And every single plant, creature, life form in the game

199
00:08:44,871 --> 00:08:46,472
contributes at least a little bit of biomass.

200
00:08:46,472 --> 00:08:48,732
So the player really just, we're kind of just asking the player,

201
00:08:48,732 --> 00:08:49,913
like, look, we don't care what you do,

202
00:08:49,913 --> 00:08:51,433
just make sure you at least play the game, all right?

203
00:08:51,433 --> 00:08:52,333
And then you can keep going.

204
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:55,234
And there's a ton of depth on demand attached to it

205
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:56,455
as well, where like.

206
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:59,631
You can always exceed the minimum requirements by quite a lot.

207
00:08:59,631 --> 00:09:01,472
There's all these different types of bonus objectives,

208
00:09:01,472 --> 00:09:03,253
like balancing the ecosystem in certain ways

209
00:09:03,253 --> 00:09:05,314
that you might be able to do as well.

210
00:09:05,314 --> 00:09:07,035
So that's one example of trying not

211
00:09:07,035 --> 00:09:08,256
to tell the player what to do.

212
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,917
A potentially more interesting example

213
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:12,778
is this thing I call agnostic unit design, which

214
00:09:12,778 --> 00:09:17,441
is essentially like, unlike designing enemies in a game

215
00:09:17,441 --> 00:09:19,222
where the only thing they are is enemies

216
00:09:19,222 --> 00:09:20,763
and the only thing they mean to the player is something

217
00:09:20,763 --> 00:09:24,025
to fight, we tried to be more agnostic.

218
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,951
it's hard to tell if a given life form in our game

219
00:09:26,951 --> 00:09:28,252
is an enemy or an ally,

220
00:09:28,252 --> 00:09:30,154
if it's a tool you can use to accomplish something

221
00:09:30,154 --> 00:09:30,875
or if it's a hazard.

222
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,796
And the answer is always that it depends.

223
00:09:32,796 --> 00:09:35,038
It depends on what the player's current goals are

224
00:09:35,038 --> 00:09:36,900
and it depends on what context they're in.

225
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:40,483
So for example, these little yellow blobs that you can see

226
00:09:40,483 --> 00:09:42,125
attached to the walls are these creatures

227
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:42,865
that we call crabs.

228
00:09:42,865 --> 00:09:44,867
And crabs like to eat seeds.

229
00:09:44,867 --> 00:09:46,769
So when plants spit out seeds

230
00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:48,451
like this plant is about to do,

231
00:09:48,451 --> 00:09:49,692
the crabs will come and eat them.

232
00:09:49,692 --> 00:09:51,693
And after they've eaten the seeds, they'll reproduce.

233
00:09:52,013 --> 00:09:54,013
So this is terrible if you're trying to grow plants

234
00:09:54,013 --> 00:09:56,354
because they're kind of like the crabs are the enemy

235
00:09:56,354 --> 00:09:58,734
to the plants in this context.

236
00:09:58,734 --> 00:10:02,355
But crabs also get eaten by other types of creatures

237
00:10:02,355 --> 00:10:04,195
in the world, such as this thing,

238
00:10:04,195 --> 00:10:07,616
which will then cause this thing to spit out seeds

239
00:10:07,616 --> 00:10:09,156
and reproduce.

240
00:10:09,156 --> 00:10:11,477
So this behavior right here is great

241
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:13,417
if you're anti-crab at the moment,

242
00:10:13,417 --> 00:10:15,877
and you're pro this thing if you're trying to grow

243
00:10:15,877 --> 00:10:16,538
more of these and less crabs.

244
00:10:16,538 --> 00:10:19,218
So it all just depends on what you're trying to accomplish.

245
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:21,258
The behaviors are always the same.

246
00:10:21,845 --> 00:10:24,507
It's just that the player's goals change from time to time.

247
00:10:24,507 --> 00:10:26,209
And if you watch that crab on the left,

248
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:28,310
he's gonna, after he gets done eating a seed,

249
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,672
he's gonna reproduce.

250
00:10:29,672 --> 00:10:30,973
Which isn't very sexy, I'm sorry.

251
00:10:30,973 --> 00:10:31,713
We're working on that part.

252
00:10:31,713 --> 00:10:34,476
It's like a little porn music.

253
00:10:34,476 --> 00:10:34,696
Okay.

254
00:10:34,696 --> 00:10:38,559
So the second part of Leave Enough Room

255
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:41,141
is give the player tools to say things.

256
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,723
I like to say that when the player's being expressive,

257
00:10:42,723 --> 00:10:44,204
they're trying to say something, you know?

258
00:10:44,204 --> 00:10:45,926
But I'm gonna phrase it a little differently.

259
00:10:45,926 --> 00:10:48,148
I'm gonna say, empower the player to generate data,

260
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,929
because it's gonna match up better with point number three.

261
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:58,567
One of my favorite examples of this comes from a series of games I worked on called Thief, which are these adventure story stealth games.

262
00:10:58,567 --> 00:11:03,290
And here's a really typical mission of Thief, is that you're breaking into this guy's castle,

263
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:08,634
and you're here to steal his special treasure, and there's all these guards that you have to sneak around, right, that he hired.

264
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:15,259
And so we found that this one player went around the entire castle and knocked out every single guard in the whole place,

265
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:19,663
and dragged them all into the dining room, their unconscious bodies, and sort of like left them on the tables and...

266
00:11:20,003 --> 00:11:22,104
you know, leaning on each other and everything.

267
00:11:22,104 --> 00:11:25,405
And then he went and got all the wine bottles in the level

268
00:11:25,405 --> 00:11:27,865
and he threw those in the dining room too.

269
00:11:27,865 --> 00:11:29,186
And so, you know, the idea is that

270
00:11:29,186 --> 00:11:30,486
when the Lord of the Manor comes home,

271
00:11:30,486 --> 00:11:32,447
he's gonna find all of his treasure missioning

272
00:11:32,447 --> 00:11:34,267
and he's gonna find that all of his guards

273
00:11:34,267 --> 00:11:35,788
apparently had this long debaucherous night

274
00:11:35,788 --> 00:11:37,928
and that's why the thief got to break in, right?

275
00:11:37,928 --> 00:11:39,068
So I really love this example.

276
00:11:39,068 --> 00:11:40,789
It's pretty similar to the example

277
00:11:40,789 --> 00:11:42,369
with Rob and his teddy bears.

278
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:44,570
And it can only happen because, you know,

279
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,790
unlike some games where all of the detail

280
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,671
in the environment is sort of baked into the walls.

281
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,120
or it's only destroyable.

282
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,623
We actually supported the player picking objects up,

283
00:11:54,623 --> 00:11:57,084
moving them around, putting them in different places,

284
00:11:57,084 --> 00:11:58,445
changing their state a little bit,

285
00:11:58,445 --> 00:12:00,767
which seems like an extravagance sometimes,

286
00:12:00,767 --> 00:12:02,548
but it is an example of empowering the player

287
00:12:02,548 --> 00:12:03,289
to generate data.

288
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:05,790
The problem with something like dialogue trees is,

289
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:08,112
yeah, the player gets to give you some data here,

290
00:12:08,112 --> 00:12:09,893
but it's easily enumerated.

291
00:12:09,893 --> 00:12:11,594
There's just three choices.

292
00:12:11,594 --> 00:12:14,496
And by that same rationale, our game on Mars,

293
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:18,452
It has a lot of expression in the sense that you can take

294
00:12:18,452 --> 00:12:20,714
any seed that you find to bring it to any other part

295
00:12:20,714 --> 00:12:23,636
of the cave, you can plant any plants in any level,

296
00:12:23,636 --> 00:12:25,098
which is a lot of freedom.

297
00:12:25,098 --> 00:12:28,520
But you can only actually plant things in certain spots

298
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,521
that we call fertile terrain.

299
00:12:29,521 --> 00:12:31,503
So theoretically, you could enumerate

300
00:12:31,503 --> 00:12:34,285
all the different combinations that were possible

301
00:12:34,285 --> 00:12:34,845
in this level.

302
00:12:34,845 --> 00:12:36,607
Two million is a nice number,

303
00:12:36,607 --> 00:12:37,608
but we can do better than that.

304
00:12:37,608 --> 00:12:40,650
So there's other ways that you can modify the plant's data.

305
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:42,932
So there's even more data available to the player.

306
00:12:42,932 --> 00:12:44,173
In this case, you know, this,

307
00:12:44,449 --> 00:12:47,412
this creature spits out water, and if he spits it off

308
00:12:47,412 --> 00:12:49,593
to the right, then he's going to water this other plant,

309
00:12:49,593 --> 00:12:51,255
and that thing's going to reproduce.

310
00:12:51,255 --> 00:12:52,556
If he spits to the left, he's going

311
00:12:52,556 --> 00:12:54,137
to hit the fertile terrain, and then he'll

312
00:12:54,137 --> 00:12:55,558
be reproducing himself.

313
00:12:55,558 --> 00:12:56,999
And the player has control over which way

314
00:12:56,999 --> 00:12:58,961
this thing is facing by using their headlamp,

315
00:12:58,961 --> 00:12:59,662
as we just saw.

316
00:12:59,662 --> 00:13:02,484
We thought about doing a few other things, too.

317
00:13:02,484 --> 00:13:04,906
Maybe you can experiment with different plants

318
00:13:04,906 --> 00:13:06,687
and feed them different things, and they would wind up

319
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,128
with different abilities.

320
00:13:08,128 --> 00:13:11,091
Maybe this guy winds up being able to spit his seeds much

321
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:13,293
further, or he actually spits them out in a balloon,

322
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,093
so it floats up.

323
00:13:14,551 --> 00:13:17,072
Either way, this would have a pretty significant impact

324
00:13:17,072 --> 00:13:19,152
on how this life form proliferates through the space.

325
00:13:19,152 --> 00:13:20,472
We've talked about giving the player

326
00:13:20,472 --> 00:13:22,673
some pretty subtle types of visual,

327
00:13:22,673 --> 00:13:26,394
aesthetical control over the creatures,

328
00:13:26,394 --> 00:13:28,975
just enough to give them a sense of organic variations

329
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,515
so they don't all look identical.

330
00:13:30,515 --> 00:13:32,556
And really the point of all this stuff

331
00:13:32,556 --> 00:13:36,197
is that in addition to which plant is where,

332
00:13:36,197 --> 00:13:37,577
you have this little packet of data

333
00:13:37,577 --> 00:13:39,257
that's very much under the player's control

334
00:13:39,257 --> 00:13:41,258
associated with each plant.

335
00:13:41,678 --> 00:13:44,260
And so it gives the player much more range

336
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,261
to express different solutions or different types

337
00:13:46,261 --> 00:13:49,243
of combination behaviors that they're trying to create,

338
00:13:49,243 --> 00:13:51,084
or just craft the way the environment looks.

339
00:13:51,084 --> 00:13:53,746
And it becomes very impossible to find

340
00:13:53,746 --> 00:13:55,027
all the potential combinations.

341
00:13:55,027 --> 00:13:56,528
It's no longer innumerable.

342
00:13:56,528 --> 00:13:59,950
And so the last part of Leave Enough Room

343
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:02,031
is responding to that data.

344
00:14:02,031 --> 00:14:04,933
The player has said something, and you're going to notice.

345
00:14:04,933 --> 00:14:06,814
The player has generated data, and then you're

346
00:14:06,814 --> 00:14:07,755
going to try to make use of it.

347
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,972
So kind of an obvious example of this is, hey,

348
00:14:10,972 --> 00:14:12,873
if you customize your avatar in Rock Band,

349
00:14:12,873 --> 00:14:14,454
then he doesn't just disappear.

350
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:16,215
You get to see him up there on stage doing his thing

351
00:14:16,215 --> 00:14:16,955
all the time.

352
00:14:16,955 --> 00:14:19,737
It includes the level complete views in Spider,

353
00:14:19,737 --> 00:14:21,678
which are like this special view mode

354
00:14:21,678 --> 00:14:22,878
that you only get when you finish a level.

355
00:14:22,878 --> 00:14:23,859
It's the only way to get it,

356
00:14:23,859 --> 00:14:24,899
and we're sort of saying like, hey,

357
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:26,540
look at all the cool stuff you did.

358
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,721
And of course, in games like Fallout,

359
00:14:28,721 --> 00:14:30,082
you have a lot of camera control,

360
00:14:30,082 --> 00:14:31,523
and when you give that to the player,

361
00:14:31,523 --> 00:14:34,665
they're able to generate their own screenshots

362
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:35,805
and share them with people.

363
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:40,683
This is another great metric of when you know you've been successful at player expression.

364
00:14:40,683 --> 00:14:45,807
Like Minecraft is clearly successful in as much as players are sharing their creations

365
00:14:45,807 --> 00:14:46,367
with each other.

366
00:14:46,367 --> 00:14:51,351
I really like achievements as a way to notice what the player is doing.

367
00:14:51,351 --> 00:14:54,974
So if a player is playing on one of the very small levels in Spider and they start to say

368
00:14:54,974 --> 00:14:58,096
like, hey, I wonder if I can fill up this entire space with my webs.

369
00:14:58,096 --> 00:15:01,579
At some point, they're going to get an achievement called Crowded House.

370
00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:04,742
You know, and that's just us saying like, hey.

371
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:07,267
we saw that you're doing that thing, we noticed,

372
00:15:07,267 --> 00:15:07,967
and we think it's cool.

373
00:15:07,967 --> 00:15:11,790
You can take achievements a little bit too far, right?

374
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:15,313
The problem with achievements is that they make it really clear

375
00:15:15,313 --> 00:15:18,495
that the designer already thought of this creative thing

376
00:15:18,495 --> 00:15:20,877
that the player thought maybe that they were the first person

377
00:15:20,877 --> 00:15:21,898
to think of, right?

378
00:15:21,898 --> 00:15:23,579
So you have to be a little careful with it.

379
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:25,880
The point isn't to anticipate every single thing

380
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,881
that the player might do.

381
00:15:26,881 --> 00:15:29,043
Instead, we like to use achievements

382
00:15:29,043 --> 00:15:31,865
as a way to sort of suggest different directions

383
00:15:31,865 --> 00:15:33,446
that the player can explore.

384
00:15:33,992 --> 00:15:36,814
So we are giving the player style points

385
00:15:36,814 --> 00:15:39,115
for trying to play the game in this cool way,

386
00:15:39,115 --> 00:15:41,737
or we're noticing that they're trying to accomplish something

387
00:15:41,737 --> 00:15:42,477
really difficult.

388
00:15:42,477 --> 00:15:44,858
But we still leave lots of room for them

389
00:15:44,858 --> 00:15:47,280
to follow up and explore more space.

390
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,381
I like stats as well.

391
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:52,142
I think they're even more open-ended than achievements.

392
00:15:52,142 --> 00:15:54,023
They're kind of like this measuring stick

393
00:15:54,023 --> 00:15:56,305
that you give the player that they

394
00:15:56,305 --> 00:15:58,786
can use to validate their own ideas about what

395
00:15:58,786 --> 00:16:00,307
might be possible in the game.

396
00:16:00,934 --> 00:16:04,075
Spider tracks stats like the largest web the player has ever

397
00:16:04,075 --> 00:16:07,617
managed to create, or the longest jump they've ever done,

398
00:16:07,617 --> 00:16:09,077
and also tracks their score.

399
00:16:09,077 --> 00:16:12,879
So I mentioned before, like in Scrabble, that score

400
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:15,039
has this profound psychological impact on the player.

401
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:17,380
And I think one of the things we did well in Spider

402
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,401
is that we sort of tried to position it more like a stat.

403
00:16:19,401 --> 00:16:21,582
It never blocks your progress.

404
00:16:21,582 --> 00:16:22,882
We only call so much attention to it.

405
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:24,863
So it's another one of these depth on demand features

406
00:16:24,863 --> 00:16:27,064
that's available to players who are interested

407
00:16:27,064 --> 00:16:28,004
in that kind of mastery.

408
00:16:29,491 --> 00:16:32,973
The concept of noticing and responding to the player's data

409
00:16:32,973 --> 00:16:34,394
is the area in all of this stuff where

410
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:37,056
I feel like there's the most potential for innovation.

411
00:16:37,056 --> 00:16:39,097
It's like the frontier, because I

412
00:16:39,097 --> 00:16:41,859
don't think we're doing nearly as much as we could.

413
00:16:41,859 --> 00:16:43,480
So here's just some ideas that we've

414
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,681
been thinking about lately.

415
00:16:44,681 --> 00:16:47,683
We have this idea that one way you

416
00:16:47,683 --> 00:16:49,844
can respond to the player's data is

417
00:16:49,844 --> 00:16:52,766
by sort of like heaping more data on top of it

418
00:16:52,766 --> 00:16:54,988
when certain conditions are met.

419
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,002
In the case of our Mars game, if you plant sort of like a combo

420
00:16:58,002 --> 00:17:00,944
of three plants right in a row, maybe that attracts

421
00:17:00,944 --> 00:17:04,607
ambient creatures that have some sort of gameplay significance.

422
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06,468
Or it could change the plants in any of those ways

423
00:17:06,468 --> 00:17:09,110
I talked about before, the appearance of them,

424
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:11,472
their movement, their gameplay relevant abilities,

425
00:17:11,472 --> 00:17:12,452
all that stuff.

426
00:17:12,452 --> 00:17:16,155
So the idea is that you're taking the player's data

427
00:17:16,155 --> 00:17:18,537
and you're bringing it even more to life in ways

428
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,238
that they might not have anticipated.

429
00:17:20,238 --> 00:17:22,460
This is something that Dwarf Fortress does really well.

430
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:25,122
It's like any little object that you drop into Dwarf Fortress.

431
00:17:25,418 --> 00:17:27,680
your little ant farm of dwarves that you're working on

432
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,301
will always respond to it and have something to say and do

433
00:17:30,301 --> 00:17:30,542
about it.

434
00:17:30,542 --> 00:17:33,224
And here's some questions I'm still wondering.

435
00:17:33,224 --> 00:17:37,247
Like, what is the appropriate response to this scenario?

436
00:17:37,247 --> 00:17:39,448
Like, what did this player want?

437
00:17:39,448 --> 00:17:41,950
Like, maybe they wanted to get to the mission debriefing

438
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,851
and hear that the Lord of the Manor

439
00:17:43,851 --> 00:17:45,413
has fired all of his guards.

440
00:17:45,413 --> 00:17:47,474
But much like the achievement, that

441
00:17:47,474 --> 00:17:49,476
feels like a very specific response.

442
00:17:49,476 --> 00:17:50,396
It's very limiting.

443
00:17:50,396 --> 00:17:52,478
It tells the player that somebody already

444
00:17:52,478 --> 00:17:53,699
thought of that.

445
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:53,779
So

446
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,941
that's assuming we could even detect that case.

447
00:17:56,941 --> 00:18:00,002
And if we could, maybe we could make a stat out of it,

448
00:18:00,002 --> 00:18:01,423
like number of guards fired.

449
00:18:01,423 --> 00:18:02,523
And that would be maybe cooler,

450
00:18:02,523 --> 00:18:06,745
because unlike the sort of the dead end of the achievement,

451
00:18:06,745 --> 00:18:10,026
this feeds back into the player's sense of creativity.

452
00:18:10,026 --> 00:18:12,047
Like, oh, now they have a new stat to explore.

453
00:18:12,047 --> 00:18:15,189
And if we could do that, then what else could we do?

454
00:18:15,189 --> 00:18:16,349
What are the different ways

455
00:18:16,349 --> 00:18:18,130
that we can respond to the player?

456
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,550
And in this case, what did Rob want?

457
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:21,851
If somebody walks up to him when he's doing this,

458
00:18:22,489 --> 00:18:24,110
Does he want them to say, hey, why did you

459
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,931
collect all those teddy bears?

460
00:18:25,931 --> 00:18:27,631
Well, I think probably not, because again, that's

461
00:18:27,631 --> 00:18:30,273
a dead end achievement kind of a response.

462
00:18:30,273 --> 00:18:32,074
And also, it seems like it'd probably

463
00:18:32,074 --> 00:18:34,054
be impossible to implement, right?

464
00:18:34,054 --> 00:18:35,595
But you could imagine implementing

465
00:18:35,595 --> 00:18:37,856
AIs that can detect collections of objects.

466
00:18:37,856 --> 00:18:39,917
So you can imagine him saying, wow, lots of teddy bears.

467
00:18:39,917 --> 00:18:41,978
In which case, Rob might think to himself,

468
00:18:41,978 --> 00:18:43,799
what else can I collect and get them to respond to?

469
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:47,841
You could imagine AIs knowing that different objects have

470
00:18:47,841 --> 00:18:48,581
different properties.

471
00:18:48,581 --> 00:18:49,362
And so they could say.

472
00:18:49,725 --> 00:18:53,248
that looks soft, and then, you know, maybe Rob thinks I should knock the guy out and

473
00:18:53,248 --> 00:18:55,549
throw him on top of my collection of teddy bears.

474
00:18:55,549 --> 00:18:56,790
Because he obviously needs a nap.

475
00:18:56,790 --> 00:19:02,614
And lastly, you could do a stat, you could imagine this guy saying, like, you are the

476
00:19:02,614 --> 00:19:05,116
sixth craziest person I've ever met.

477
00:19:05,116 --> 00:19:09,238
At which case, Rob might wonder how to become the first craziest person that guy has ever

478
00:19:09,238 --> 00:19:09,319
met.

479
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:09,659
And that is it.

480
00:19:09,659 --> 00:19:10,139
Thank you very much.

481
00:19:10,139 --> 00:19:19,365
We've got five minutes for questions.

482
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:29,260
You got to use the mic.

483
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:33,842
That's how we know it's legit.

484
00:19:33,842 --> 00:19:34,102
Yeah.

485
00:19:34,102 --> 00:19:35,582
Question.

486
00:19:35,582 --> 00:19:35,983
OK.

487
00:19:35,983 --> 00:19:42,365
When you think of a game, then, do you

488
00:19:42,365 --> 00:19:44,446
think of this aspect first?

489
00:19:44,446 --> 00:19:47,347
Or do you think of the concept itself first?

490
00:19:47,347 --> 00:19:48,588
Or how linked are they?

491
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:49,268
When I think of what?

492
00:19:49,268 --> 00:19:52,370
When you think of when you start a game.

493
00:19:53,182 --> 00:19:55,503
When I'm in the conceptual stages of a game?

494
00:19:55,503 --> 00:19:55,903
Right.

495
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:57,703
In the conceptual stages of a game,

496
00:19:57,703 --> 00:20:00,064
do you just think of an idea for a game first?

497
00:20:00,064 --> 00:20:04,446
Or do you actually think, I want to make this type of game first?

498
00:20:04,446 --> 00:20:07,127
I'm sure this answer varies from designer to designer.

499
00:20:07,127 --> 00:20:10,148
For me, I think at the very origin of a game's idea,

500
00:20:10,148 --> 00:20:11,089
it's a lot of different things.

501
00:20:11,089 --> 00:20:13,390
It's sort of like fictional concept.

502
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:13,990
It's mechanic.

503
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:15,931
And I would think of these things

504
00:20:15,931 --> 00:20:19,152
are more like the principles or philosophies that

505
00:20:19,152 --> 00:20:21,713
are in the DNA of me as a designer in my studio.

506
00:20:22,924 --> 00:20:24,685
They come pretty naturally.

507
00:20:24,685 --> 00:20:29,328
I would never make a String of Pearls game.

508
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:32,129
Do you have a follow-up?

509
00:20:32,129 --> 00:20:32,329
No.

510
00:20:32,329 --> 00:20:32,790
Okay, cool.

511
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,991
Another question, please.

512
00:20:34,991 --> 00:20:35,231
One.

513
00:20:35,231 --> 00:20:37,212
Okay, cool.

514
00:20:37,212 --> 00:20:40,954
How crazy would it be, in your opinion, to...

515
00:20:40,954 --> 00:20:41,735
Five.

516
00:20:41,735 --> 00:20:42,175
Excellent.

517
00:20:42,175 --> 00:20:43,315
Next question.

518
00:20:43,315 --> 00:20:43,976
I'm sorry, go ahead.

519
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:50,960
To try and create an AI that can respond to these customizations in such a way where

520
00:20:51,313 --> 00:20:54,254
I mean, conceivably, if you had a smart enough system,

521
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:57,134
it might respond to the exigent circumstance

522
00:20:57,134 --> 00:20:59,675
of the wine bottles and the guards being there.

523
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,455
Now, that would be a pretty robust system.

524
00:21:01,455 --> 00:21:04,776
It's like, no, beyond Watson level.

525
00:21:04,776 --> 00:21:08,637
But if you can respond to things in the way that a person would,

526
00:21:08,637 --> 00:21:11,818
it can actually have creative responses

527
00:21:11,818 --> 00:21:14,619
that are deeper than just a programmer trying

528
00:21:14,619 --> 00:21:17,300
to outthink the possibilities that a person could come up

529
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:17,440
with.

530
00:21:18,998 --> 00:21:20,299
I'm not sure what your question was.

531
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:23,201
I mean, I guess a pretty important caveat, right,

532
00:21:23,201 --> 00:21:25,523
is I don't know if it would be smart to pursue

533
00:21:25,523 --> 00:21:26,984
any of those things at the end.

534
00:21:26,984 --> 00:21:28,846
Like, they seem like they would be really challenging.

535
00:21:28,846 --> 00:21:30,807
But also, as I said, I really do think

536
00:21:30,807 --> 00:21:32,208
this is like one of the frontiers.

537
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,610
Like, I think Minecraft kind of shows you

538
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:36,531
that people are really interested in expressing

539
00:21:36,531 --> 00:21:39,313
themselves, and people really like the features in Minecraft

540
00:21:39,313 --> 00:21:41,915
that are more responsive, where like you place an object that

541
00:21:41,915 --> 00:21:44,297
has gameplay meaning, as opposed to just is visual,

542
00:21:44,297 --> 00:21:45,658
or whatever.

543
00:21:46,075 --> 00:21:47,656
And the things at the end I was suggesting

544
00:21:47,656 --> 00:21:51,977
were some more sophisticated potential thoughts, concepts

545
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,658
about ways we might respond.

546
00:21:53,658 --> 00:21:56,759
Some of them might be more possible than others.

547
00:21:56,759 --> 00:21:58,199
One thing I didn't mention is that, I'm

548
00:21:58,199 --> 00:22:00,620
not going to give any spoilers, but we're

549
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:03,661
thinking about using some of the ideas that were present

550
00:22:03,661 --> 00:22:05,081
in the thief example to try to drive

551
00:22:05,081 --> 00:22:08,162
multiple endings in the game we're working on now,

552
00:22:08,162 --> 00:22:09,443
in the Mars game.

553
00:22:09,443 --> 00:22:09,923
OK.

554
00:22:09,923 --> 00:22:10,523
Cool.

555
00:22:10,523 --> 00:22:12,204
Hi, Randy.

556
00:22:12,204 --> 00:22:12,604
Trent Custers.

557
00:22:12,604 --> 00:22:13,144
Hi.

558
00:22:13,144 --> 00:22:15,605
Basically, I'm just wondering in terms of.

559
00:22:16,032 --> 00:22:19,493
the generating data and what it sounds like to me is it's just

560
00:22:19,493 --> 00:22:23,174
ensuring that there are those feedback loops for player behaviors that they go

561
00:22:23,174 --> 00:22:24,294
out and they

562
00:22:24,294 --> 00:22:27,735
design an experience themselves. So it's about them reaching into the game and

563
00:22:27,735 --> 00:22:28,475
the game I guess

564
00:22:28,475 --> 00:22:33,117
touching them back when they put their hand out. So with something like Minecraft

565
00:22:33,117 --> 00:22:34,037
you could imagine

566
00:22:34,037 --> 00:22:37,078
that the feedback loop is actually in the community where Minecraft doesn't

567
00:22:37,078 --> 00:22:39,659
actually provide the feedback to you for building these

568
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:43,760
you know, building the USS Enterprise to scale. It's the community that does that.

569
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,700
Is there a way that you...

570
00:22:45,192 --> 00:22:48,652
could balance this between, say for example, stats are a brilliant thing to put into the

571
00:22:48,652 --> 00:22:51,733
community, onto leaderboards and stuff like that.

572
00:22:51,733 --> 00:22:57,174
I guess my question is, how do you know from the start and whereabouts do you start in

573
00:22:57,174 --> 00:23:01,835
development planning whether these things are social community feedback loops, this

574
00:23:01,835 --> 00:23:06,296
data, or whether it's actually in the game encoding these systems?

575
00:23:06,296 --> 00:23:08,857
Um, you know, anybody's guess might be as good as mine.

576
00:23:08,857 --> 00:23:11,637
One thing I would say is that, um, the

577
00:23:11,983 --> 00:23:13,924
Feature, there's sharing features, right?

578
00:23:13,924 --> 00:23:14,845
There's features which are like,

579
00:23:14,845 --> 00:23:16,606
take a screenshot, post it on Facebook.

580
00:23:16,606 --> 00:23:18,268
Like, hey, here's the Tony Hawk

581
00:23:18,268 --> 00:23:19,629
video capture editing suite.

582
00:23:19,629 --> 00:23:22,411
Like, those are clearly features

583
00:23:22,411 --> 00:23:24,613
which are intended to help the player

584
00:23:24,613 --> 00:23:26,915
record and share their experience.

585
00:23:26,915 --> 00:23:28,156
Those are obviously always gonna,

586
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:30,317
to generate more involvement with the community.

587
00:23:31,693 --> 00:23:34,234
On a personal level, I'm more interested,

588
00:23:34,234 --> 00:23:35,995
I think multiplayer and sharing and community

589
00:23:35,995 --> 00:23:37,336
and all that stuff is great.

590
00:23:37,336 --> 00:23:38,957
But I would really like the games,

591
00:23:38,957 --> 00:23:40,658
even on a single player capacity,

592
00:23:40,658 --> 00:23:42,960
to be able to respond more to the player.

593
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,580
Yeah.

594
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,641
Because then you're just multiplying

595
00:23:45,641 --> 00:23:46,862
when you add the community.

596
00:23:46,862 --> 00:23:47,763
Yeah, exactly.

597
00:23:47,763 --> 00:23:48,823
Thank you.

598
00:23:48,823 --> 00:23:49,223
Thank you.

599
00:23:49,223 --> 00:23:51,625
I think we have time for one more question.

600
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:55,367
Evan Ballster.

601
00:23:55,367 --> 00:24:00,230
What are your thoughts on sort of the

602
00:24:01,403 --> 00:24:10,850
the incompatibility between single player gaming and expressive gaming whereas as opposed to

603
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:18,735
the incompatibility between a single place single player goal-based game and an expressive game.

604
00:24:18,735 --> 00:24:23,439
A single player control-based game in an expressive game?

605
00:24:23,439 --> 00:24:27,601
Goal-based. Goal-based game. Based on a specific objective the player

606
00:24:27,601 --> 00:24:29,683
needs to accomplish as opposed to these.

607
00:24:29,804 --> 00:24:31,024
I'm going to try this answer.

608
00:24:31,024 --> 00:24:33,765
And if it doesn't work, just come back up after and talk

609
00:24:33,765 --> 00:24:34,025
to me.

610
00:24:34,025 --> 00:24:39,147
I mean, I think it's just kind of a question of how strongly

611
00:24:39,147 --> 00:24:41,527
you're suggesting what the player needs to do.

612
00:24:41,527 --> 00:24:44,448
Like, if you're very specific about what the player's

613
00:24:44,448 --> 00:24:46,249
supposed to be doing, and there's only a small number

614
00:24:46,249 --> 00:24:48,889
of ways to accomplish those goals, then, of course,

615
00:24:48,889 --> 00:24:50,370
you're narrowing the range of options

616
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:52,891
for the player, which is really just leaving less room for them

617
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:54,051
to be expressive.

618
00:24:54,051 --> 00:24:55,091
It's only telling them, like, here's

619
00:24:55,091 --> 00:24:56,472
how you're supposed to play our game.

620
00:24:56,472 --> 00:24:58,752
Whereas if you

621
00:24:59,065 --> 00:25:01,326
give them much more open-ended goals,

622
00:25:01,326 --> 00:25:03,866
or if you don't give them goals at all,

623
00:25:03,866 --> 00:25:05,407
which is sort of the Minecraft approach,

624
00:25:05,407 --> 00:25:06,747
or the Dwarf Fortress approach,

625
00:25:06,747 --> 00:25:09,688
where there's kind of ambiguous goals,

626
00:25:09,688 --> 00:25:11,648
there's much more room for them to be creative.

627
00:25:11,648 --> 00:25:13,848
The thing is the player will sort of decide for themselves

628
00:25:13,848 --> 00:25:17,089
what the game is, what they're supposed to be doing.

629
00:25:17,089 --> 00:25:18,649
Minecraft, it needs a lot of guidance,

630
00:25:18,649 --> 00:25:21,590
but one of the things that works is once you realize

631
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:23,650
your job is to stay alive, then you're like,

632
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:25,591
well, now I'm staying alive, what else should I do?

633
00:25:25,591 --> 00:25:27,271
I've learned how to build stuff,

634
00:25:27,271 --> 00:25:28,552
maybe I'll build some more stuff.

635
00:25:28,939 --> 00:25:29,781
Superficial stuff.

636
00:25:29,781 --> 00:25:30,162
I don't know.

637
00:25:30,162 --> 00:25:30,843
I'll check it out.

638
00:25:30,843 --> 00:25:33,970
You should follow up just because we've

639
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:35,533
got to keep rolling because we've got really

640
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:36,114
tight presentations.

641
00:25:36,114 --> 00:25:37,457
Thank you guys very much.

642
00:25:37,457 --> 00:25:39,120
And come up and talk to me if you have more questions.
