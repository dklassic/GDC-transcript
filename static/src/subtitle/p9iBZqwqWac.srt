1
00:00:05,056 --> 00:00:08,359
My name is Whitney Clayton, and I'm the art director at Compulsion Games.

2
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:13,945
And my talk is about how we created the art direction for We Happy Few,

3
00:00:14,786 --> 00:00:19,171
and how we realized this art direction with our procedural generation technology.

4
00:00:19,191 --> 00:00:22,955
Uh-oh. Sorry.

5
00:00:25,398 --> 00:00:25,558
Okay.

6
00:00:26,098 --> 00:00:29,281
So, We Happy Few is a first-person roguelike survival game.

7
00:00:30,102 --> 00:00:32,324
It's set in 1960s dystopian England,

8
00:00:32,844 --> 00:00:34,606
and it's about this society,

9
00:00:35,206 --> 00:00:36,567
the Society of Wellington Wells,

10
00:00:37,288 --> 00:00:39,930
and they're addicted to this drug called joy.

11
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:42,252
And they take this drug in order to forget

12
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,214
this terrible thing they did during World War II,

13
00:00:44,594 --> 00:00:46,156
but also to be happy all the time.

14
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:47,897
So you play a downer,

15
00:00:48,057 --> 00:00:50,359
so somebody who has willingly gone off of your joy.

16
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,042
And as a downer, you're a threat to the society.

17
00:00:53,342 --> 00:00:58,366
So your objective is to survive long enough to escape, but also to understand kind of

18
00:00:58,406 --> 00:01:01,388
your role in the society and how it got to where it is.

19
00:01:03,383 --> 00:01:05,544
We Happy Few happens to be procedural.

20
00:01:05,844 --> 00:01:08,445
So for us, this means that each time you play the game,

21
00:01:08,945 --> 00:01:11,446
the road layout is different, the streets are different,

22
00:01:11,546 --> 00:01:13,907
and where the gameplay locations are all different.

23
00:01:14,967 --> 00:01:16,827
But before I get into that, I'll just give you

24
00:01:16,847 --> 00:01:18,308
a little background about myself.

25
00:01:19,448 --> 00:01:21,709
Before I was an art director, I was a concept artist.

26
00:01:22,664 --> 00:01:25,946
And before I was a concept artist, I was studying painting in university.

27
00:01:26,606 --> 00:01:29,087
So, I like art and I don't like math.

28
00:01:29,748 --> 00:01:33,429
And when the studio head asked me how I felt about doing a procedural game,

29
00:01:33,449 --> 00:01:35,330
I was like, sounds great!

30
00:01:36,631 --> 00:01:38,332
Because I had no idea what he was talking about.

31
00:01:40,353 --> 00:01:45,055
And the whole thing has been way more challenging than I could have imagined.

32
00:01:45,555 --> 00:01:50,338
But we've come a long way and it's been really exciting and interesting process.

33
00:01:52,088 --> 00:01:55,530
So creating a rich and expressive art direction is challenging enough.

34
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,831
We have our own artistic rules to consider.

35
00:01:57,971 --> 00:02:02,794
So design, composition, lighting, all that.

36
00:02:03,314 --> 00:02:05,835
But with a procedural system, everything is a hundred times harder.

37
00:02:05,855 --> 00:02:09,377
And that is because it puts constraints on the artist's tools.

38
00:02:09,858 --> 00:02:12,759
So one of our biggest constraints is environmental composition.

39
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:13,800
So here you'll see...

40
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,902
A bunch of buildings lined up, but there's this big random gap

41
00:02:17,942 --> 00:02:18,742
in between the buildings.

42
00:02:19,203 --> 00:02:20,724
And if this was a handcrafted area,

43
00:02:20,784 --> 00:02:23,245
we definitely wouldn't leave this gap there.

44
00:02:23,745 --> 00:02:25,446
But this was a problem with the system,

45
00:02:25,606 --> 00:02:28,168
and we had to live with this visually for a long time,

46
00:02:28,408 --> 00:02:30,109
which was pretty painful, considering

47
00:02:30,129 --> 00:02:31,450
that if we were building this by hand,

48
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,571
we would just close this gap.

49
00:02:35,453 --> 00:02:38,355
It's also experimental, this technology.

50
00:02:39,176 --> 00:02:42,319
So there are, sometimes it feels like it has a mind of its own.

51
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,184
So this was a bug that we had for a while where five buildings were showing up in a row.

52
00:02:47,825 --> 00:02:52,149
And again, if we were hand crafting this space, we definitely wouldn't do this.

53
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:58,015
And it's not until we playtest the heck out of this game that we find issues like this.

54
00:03:00,178 --> 00:03:01,258
But this is where we are now.

55
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:03,740
So it's taken a long time to get here,

56
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,482
both on the art and tech side, but we've learned a lot.

57
00:03:07,203 --> 00:03:09,504
And it's really exciting to see it coming together.

58
00:03:12,086 --> 00:03:14,688
So in this talk, I'm gonna go over pre-pre-production,

59
00:03:14,908 --> 00:03:17,010
so how we kind of came up with the core themes

60
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,352
for this game and how this led to our choice in setting.

61
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:25,296
Pre-production, so how we took this setting

62
00:03:25,476 --> 00:03:27,297
and created our own unique world from this.

63
00:03:29,534 --> 00:03:31,716
and production, so how we realized this world

64
00:03:31,756 --> 00:03:33,497
with the procedural generation system.

65
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,561
So very early on in the project,

66
00:03:37,961 --> 00:03:40,324
there were a few key concepts we knew we wanted

67
00:03:40,384 --> 00:03:41,124
for the next game.

68
00:03:42,185 --> 00:03:44,187
These were kind of concepts that we would use

69
00:03:44,247 --> 00:03:46,529
to build kind of the building blocks of our foundation.

70
00:03:47,887 --> 00:03:50,528
So we knew we wanted to try to do a procedural game.

71
00:03:51,388 --> 00:03:54,610
Our first game is called Contrast, and it was a

72
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:55,550
handcrafted game.

73
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,671
And after about two and a half years of production, we had a

74
00:03:58,731 --> 00:04:01,832
game that was about four hours long, and players were just

75
00:04:02,072 --> 00:04:02,813
blowing through it.

76
00:04:04,053 --> 00:04:07,554
So we knew we wanted to make a larger, richer environment.

77
00:04:08,812 --> 00:04:10,934
with more that would encourage exploration.

78
00:04:11,634 --> 00:04:13,175
But we had the same size Indy team.

79
00:04:13,956 --> 00:04:16,137
We also had some very strong tech minds on the team.

80
00:04:16,317 --> 00:04:18,379
So we thought that if we could pull off procedural

81
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,161
generation, it would be worth the risk.

82
00:04:23,464 --> 00:04:27,624
We knew we also wanted to try to do a survival game. It seemed to work well with the concept of

83
00:04:27,744 --> 00:04:35,446
procedural generation because you die a lot. But also we just have a fondness for survival games.

84
00:04:35,506 --> 00:04:39,847
We thought an interesting take on a survival game could be urban survival. So if you're

85
00:04:39,907 --> 00:04:46,428
surviving in a city rather than in a wilderness setting. And this would lend itself to kind of

86
00:04:46,969 --> 00:04:48,509
unique threats and challenges.

87
00:04:49,788 --> 00:04:53,250
So if you're surviving in an urban environment, your

88
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,652
biggest threat would be the society itself.

89
00:04:57,032 --> 00:04:59,654
So we thought it was really interesting, this idea that

90
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:03,116
you were kind of this sane outsider in this obscure

91
00:05:03,176 --> 00:05:05,838
world where you have to learn the rules of this world in

92
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:10,361
order to blend in and conform to this society.

93
00:05:16,681 --> 00:05:25,108
We also like the idea of, we also like the idea of, sorry,

94
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:31,274
my timer stopped working, so, of doing a dystopian alternate

95
00:05:31,294 --> 00:05:39,101
history, so we love the idea of doing a dystopian, so where one

96
00:05:39,141 --> 00:05:41,683
event changes the course of history and creates kind of a

97
00:05:42,123 --> 00:05:43,785
parallel history.

98
00:05:44,997 --> 00:05:46,238
with its own unique rules.

99
00:05:47,499 --> 00:05:50,021
Doing a dystopia seemed exciting because it

100
00:05:50,061 --> 00:05:52,944
would lend itself for us to be creative and kind of create

101
00:05:52,984 --> 00:05:53,885
this fantasy world.

102
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:56,687
But we also like the idea of working from history.

103
00:05:57,288 --> 00:05:59,050
I personally like this a lot because I

104
00:06:00,171 --> 00:06:03,634
like building off of material from history.

105
00:06:03,974 --> 00:06:06,596
I think it gives us kind of a lot of interesting material

106
00:06:06,717 --> 00:06:07,738
to work off from.

107
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:10,620
But we didn't want to do a.

108
00:06:12,057 --> 00:06:15,638
sort of bleak, authoritarian, dystopian,

109
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:19,359
one where people are wearing work suits and marching around

110
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:21,559
because this has been done before.

111
00:06:21,579 --> 00:06:25,381
I also didn't want to necessarily be in a world

112
00:06:25,441 --> 00:06:27,541
where it's very bleak and depressing.

113
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:30,282
So we thought it would be much more interesting to do

114
00:06:30,342 --> 00:06:31,882
something more like Brave New World.

115
00:06:32,563 --> 00:06:37,924
Maybe it's a society that's kind of done this to themselves.

116
00:06:40,035 --> 00:06:42,817
It's kind of ambiguous whether it's a dystopia or a utopia.

117
00:06:43,318 --> 00:06:46,120
And Brave New World is much more stylish than 1984.

118
00:06:47,081 --> 00:06:51,444
This is what inspired the idea that maybe this society is

119
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:56,027
kind of repressed by its own happiness, which kind of led

120
00:06:56,147 --> 00:06:59,250
to the idea of the mask.

121
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:02,772
So the mask is kind of one of our most iconic

122
00:07:02,852 --> 00:07:03,713
elements for the game.

123
00:07:03,733 --> 00:07:06,595
This was the first concept I did for the game.

124
00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:14,635
I was really trying to get this feeling of somebody who's repressed by their own happiness

125
00:07:15,296 --> 00:07:19,520
or maybe conforming to a world where happiness is very valuable.

126
00:07:20,581 --> 00:07:23,223
So I was designing the mask to be kind of like

127
00:07:23,924 --> 00:07:26,265
to look like the person's face, but it

128
00:07:26,325 --> 00:07:28,827
pushes the corners of their mouth up into a smile.

129
00:07:29,467 --> 00:07:31,728
And I was trying to get this kind of contrast

130
00:07:31,768 --> 00:07:33,589
between the look in this person's eyes

131
00:07:33,769 --> 00:07:36,451
and the smile on their face, and kind of give them

132
00:07:36,471 --> 00:07:38,272
this sense of kind of obliviousness

133
00:07:38,472 --> 00:07:40,013
or like running on autopilot.

134
00:07:42,624 --> 00:07:44,826
But it turns out that this actually existed.

135
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:49,128
So in Budapest after World War I,

136
00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:52,030
there were these people and they called themselves

137
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:53,311
the Society of Smiles.

138
00:07:54,492 --> 00:07:57,794
And they made these super terrifying masks

139
00:07:57,874 --> 00:08:00,836
to try to motivate each other to be happy.

140
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:03,878
And I have no idea what they were thinking

141
00:08:03,898 --> 00:08:05,058
because these are horrifying.

142
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,502
And I think they're way less convincing than our masks.

143
00:08:08,762 --> 00:08:12,064
But so it happened in real life, but we didn't know that.

144
00:08:14,545 --> 00:08:16,886
So after deciding on these early concepts,

145
00:08:17,406 --> 00:08:19,307
I knew we needed to kind of pull core themes

146
00:08:19,527 --> 00:08:22,069
that we could use to inspire what our setting would be.

147
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:24,530
Doing this is important because it creates

148
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,291
a really clear foundation and something

149
00:08:26,311 --> 00:08:27,952
that we can always go back and look at.

150
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:30,491
and refer to.

151
00:08:31,172 --> 00:08:33,875
So these core themes were conformity.

152
00:08:34,616 --> 00:08:39,421
So this is a place where everyone cares about fitting in

153
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,523
and adhering to social rules.

154
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:45,417
Paranoia and suspicion.

155
00:08:46,118 --> 00:08:49,161
We wanted the player to be the only kind of sane outsider

156
00:08:49,621 --> 00:08:52,984
in this suspiciously perfect place,

157
00:08:54,445 --> 00:08:57,528
and to give you a sense of paranoia when you're playing

158
00:08:57,648 --> 00:08:59,329
that you will be caught as that outsider.

159
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:02,372
And a feeling of suspicion from the people around you

160
00:09:02,412 --> 00:09:04,514
that maybe you don't blend into this world,

161
00:09:04,754 --> 00:09:05,835
or you're not part of this world.

162
00:09:07,757 --> 00:09:09,999
Happiness, so this is a place that values happiness

163
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:10,919
above everything else.

164
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:13,476
and denial.

165
00:09:13,656 --> 00:09:17,277
So their obsession with happiness

166
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:19,958
is causing their society to crumble apart.

167
00:09:20,038 --> 00:09:21,839
And they're kind of in denial of the fact

168
00:09:21,939 --> 00:09:26,241
that this is because of their own choices that they've made.

169
00:09:26,901 --> 00:09:30,162
They're kind of being willfully oblivious of the fact

170
00:09:30,263 --> 00:09:32,363
that this is a collapsing society.

171
00:09:34,024 --> 00:09:40,307
So all of this led to Britain in the 60s.

172
00:09:40,548 --> 00:09:43,549
This seemed to fit all of these settings pretty well.

173
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:47,071
It's a very kind of fun and iconic setting.

174
00:09:47,831 --> 00:09:50,593
And I'll just tell you a little bit about how we came

175
00:09:50,653 --> 00:09:51,533
to this conclusion.

176
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:58,334
So when I was thinking about a place that kind of values

177
00:09:58,454 --> 00:10:01,297
appearance in society, I was reminded of this show

178
00:10:01,377 --> 00:10:04,640
that I grew up watching called Keeping Up Appearances.

179
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,783
I don't know if anyone has seen this show.

180
00:10:07,924 --> 00:10:08,544
But it's about.

181
00:10:09,235 --> 00:10:11,236
a woman and her name is Hyacinth Bucket,

182
00:10:11,676 --> 00:10:13,217
but she tells everyone it's Bouquet.

183
00:10:13,777 --> 00:10:15,778
And she's from a lower working class family,

184
00:10:16,499 --> 00:10:18,500
but she lives in this upper middle class neighborhood

185
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,241
and she's determined to prove to her neighbors

186
00:10:20,281 --> 00:10:21,762
that she's part of the upper middle class.

187
00:10:22,302 --> 00:10:24,763
So it's all about rules and etiquette

188
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:26,925
and appearance in society.

189
00:10:27,545 --> 00:10:30,066
So this was actually the first inspiration for the setting.

190
00:10:30,507 --> 00:10:32,428
So people are like, oh, were you inspired by Bioshock?

191
00:10:32,914 --> 00:10:36,797
That was actually this show.

192
00:10:38,158 --> 00:10:40,360
And then I was reminded of Hot Fuzz.

193
00:10:42,484 --> 00:10:47,866
So we knew we wanted you to be this kind of sane outsider in this suspiciously perfect place.

194
00:10:48,426 --> 00:10:51,707
And that's pretty much exactly what this movie is about.

195
00:10:51,767 --> 00:10:55,769
So it's about this cop and he goes to this very quaint, perfect English town

196
00:10:55,809 --> 00:10:59,850
and people are disappearing and he starts to wonder what's going on

197
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:02,511
and then they become suspicious of him figuring it out.

198
00:11:03,211 --> 00:11:08,973
And this idea of kind of a village or a small English town that's perfect but it has

199
00:11:09,013 --> 00:11:09,853
like a deep secret.

200
00:11:10,634 --> 00:11:14,039
This is a pretty common theme in British media, so the

201
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,441
prisoner is another example.

202
00:11:15,822 --> 00:11:17,284
And that's something we've pulled from a lot.

203
00:11:17,484 --> 00:11:19,447
There's also an episode of The Avengers that

204
00:11:19,808 --> 00:11:20,789
touches on this subject.

205
00:11:22,553 --> 00:11:24,074
So Britain seems like a good choice.

206
00:11:25,775 --> 00:11:26,736
So now we have to pick a decade.

207
00:11:27,476 --> 00:11:30,077
And if we're going to choose a decade that symbolizes

208
00:11:30,117 --> 00:11:33,019
happiness, the 60s is an obvious choice.

209
00:11:33,739 --> 00:11:36,380
So Winston Churchill had died, and he had marked the end of

210
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,422
this kind of war-torn area that was ruled by the upper

211
00:11:39,462 --> 00:11:42,844
class, and Harold Wilson became prime minister.

212
00:11:43,724 --> 00:11:45,966
And he was all about change and reform and progress.

213
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:50,109
And so there were a lot of great social reforms that

214
00:11:50,129 --> 00:11:50,990
happened at this time.

215
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:55,373
But the kind of Austin Powers swinging 60s that we think of

216
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:58,015
was really only in a small part of London called

217
00:11:58,055 --> 00:11:58,735
Carnaby Street.

218
00:12:00,077 --> 00:12:03,961
So England wanted to kind of project this idea that that's what England was about,

219
00:12:04,021 --> 00:12:05,923
but really most of England was stuck in the 50s.

220
00:12:06,804 --> 00:12:10,788
However, because of this kind of commercialization of pop culture, such as the Beatles,

221
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:15,714
there was this social shift in values where people all of a sudden started

222
00:12:16,174 --> 00:12:19,898
caring about image and fashion and hedonism more than they had before.

223
00:12:22,673 --> 00:12:26,795
And then modernism, which is kind of the key aesthetic movement of the 50s and 60s.

224
00:12:27,555 --> 00:12:30,996
And we like the idea that our society is kind of rejecting their history

225
00:12:31,036 --> 00:12:36,658
and rejecting their environment for this kind of delusional idea of their utopia.

226
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:40,320
And that's very similar to the modernist movement, which

227
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:45,044
was kind of a rejection of history and the environment

228
00:12:45,084 --> 00:12:48,506
for this fantastical vision of the future.

229
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:51,868
And this was inspired by technological progress

230
00:12:52,268 --> 00:12:55,150
and affected everything from design and fashion.

231
00:12:55,571 --> 00:12:57,092
But one of the most obvious examples

232
00:12:57,312 --> 00:12:59,013
is brutalist architecture.

233
00:13:00,074 --> 00:13:01,494
So you had kind of, um.

234
00:13:03,517 --> 00:13:05,877
architects plowing down historic town centers

235
00:13:05,937 --> 00:13:09,959
and building these giant space age buildings, right,

236
00:13:10,179 --> 00:13:11,679
surrounded by old Tudor buildings.

237
00:13:12,379 --> 00:13:14,020
And they weren't designed to help people

238
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,561
or to be comfortable, but under this kind of fantasy

239
00:13:16,621 --> 00:13:18,941
that houses are machines for living in.

240
00:13:19,702 --> 00:13:21,802
So it's very kind of delusional idea

241
00:13:22,262 --> 00:13:23,323
of what the future should be

242
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:25,843
that's very disconnected from reality.

243
00:13:26,304 --> 00:13:27,884
So this seemed to fit the dystopia

244
00:13:27,904 --> 00:13:29,565
that we wanted to explore.

245
00:13:31,846 --> 00:13:34,429
So, 60s in England seems like a good choice.

246
00:13:35,249 --> 00:13:37,531
At this point, we all start brainstorming.

247
00:13:37,811 --> 00:13:42,415
So our narrative director goes off and crafts this very

248
00:13:42,475 --> 00:13:44,597
elaborate back story of what our world's going to be.

249
00:13:45,338 --> 00:13:47,079
The designers start thinking of mechanics.

250
00:13:48,801 --> 00:13:52,924
The programmers start working on the generation system.

251
00:13:53,325 --> 00:13:54,466
And I started concepting.

252
00:13:56,227 --> 00:13:58,209
So this was the first concept I did for the game.

253
00:13:59,191 --> 00:14:03,576
And for based off of these, the first kind of environmental concept.

254
00:14:04,057 --> 00:14:08,203
And I was really trying to get this feeling of an old world England

255
00:14:08,683 --> 00:14:14,071
with this positive regime of happiness blatantly kind of layered on top of it.

256
00:14:14,091 --> 00:14:14,131
So.

257
00:14:15,673 --> 00:14:17,994
They have these old crumbly Tudor buildings,

258
00:14:18,355 --> 00:14:20,356
which left these kind of nice canvases

259
00:14:20,436 --> 00:14:22,338
where people could have painted colors on them.

260
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:23,839
They painted the roads.

261
00:14:24,479 --> 00:14:26,801
They have kind of modern sleek elements

262
00:14:26,881 --> 00:14:29,423
like the tube televisions lying in front of them,

263
00:14:31,284 --> 00:14:32,746
creating this really nice contrast.

264
00:14:33,486 --> 00:14:35,728
And then you have like the traditional English things

265
00:14:35,768 --> 00:14:37,149
like the bunting and the awnings.

266
00:14:38,412 --> 00:14:41,214
And then I wanted the sky to be kind of this sickly, off

267
00:14:41,254 --> 00:14:45,956
pudding green to kind of make it feel a bit uneasy.

268
00:14:48,297 --> 00:14:53,379
And then our tech director and I also were doing a lot of

269
00:14:53,419 --> 00:15:00,042
research on road planning and layout and how the generation

270
00:15:00,082 --> 00:15:03,804
system should try to mimic a real village or city.

271
00:15:03,924 --> 00:15:05,485
We knew we wanted a couple different types of

272
00:15:05,545 --> 00:15:06,505
environments in this world.

273
00:15:08,634 --> 00:15:11,416
We researched London and how that's laid out,

274
00:15:11,596 --> 00:15:16,158
and British villages, which really have no logic

275
00:15:16,178 --> 00:15:18,339
or patterns or anything.

276
00:15:21,701 --> 00:15:24,063
So we kind of have these building blocks.

277
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:27,064
Now we, sorry.

278
00:15:28,225 --> 00:15:30,246
So now we need to kind of establish the building blocks

279
00:15:30,326 --> 00:15:33,108
as to what makes our own world unique

280
00:15:33,228 --> 00:15:35,029
from England in the 60s.

281
00:15:37,969 --> 00:15:42,375
So one of the things that in our art direction we always think about is this idea of retrofuturism.

282
00:15:43,404 --> 00:15:44,864
So I talked a lot about modernism.

283
00:15:45,605 --> 00:15:48,185
But because this is a dystopia and it's a fantasy,

284
00:15:48,645 --> 00:15:50,886
modernism isn't really enough.

285
00:15:51,366 --> 00:15:54,006
So I think of retrofuturism as kind of an extension of that.

286
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:57,627
So we like this idea that the society is running out

287
00:15:57,647 --> 00:15:59,467
of resources, but they've spent their money

288
00:15:59,547 --> 00:16:02,728
on this kind of expensive, fancy, useless gadgets

289
00:16:03,308 --> 00:16:05,009
that are very much a fantasy.

290
00:16:05,929 --> 00:16:09,730
So I did a lot of research on old kind of

291
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:13,793
retrofuturistic designs, and they very much are based on a

292
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:15,175
fantasy even in their designs.

293
00:16:15,235 --> 00:16:20,142
So they have no visible parts, sleek curves in plastic.

294
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:22,585
So this was a lot of fun to research.

295
00:16:24,464 --> 00:16:27,226
And this is an example of one of our pieces of retro technology.

296
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:29,668
It's called the compliment machine.

297
00:16:30,349 --> 00:16:33,231
And its only purpose is really to compliment people

298
00:16:33,311 --> 00:16:35,033
and to make them feel good about themselves.

299
00:16:35,553 --> 00:16:40,297
So again, kind of simple shapes, clean plastic, black seams.

300
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:44,681
It's very kind of sophisticated, but totally useless.

301
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:49,527
Another important thing that we always think about

302
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:50,988
with the art direction is style.

303
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:54,750
So what I mean by style is like lighting, shapes,

304
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,091
color, composition, design,

305
00:16:56,131 --> 00:16:58,632
and how that affects the kind of meaning of the environment

306
00:16:59,093 --> 00:17:00,453
and the type of environment that you're in.

307
00:17:00,694 --> 00:17:03,835
So we have kind of two main worlds

308
00:17:04,015 --> 00:17:06,497
that maybe you guys know from either playing the game

309
00:17:06,557 --> 00:17:07,257
or seeing trailers.

310
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:09,258
We have the garden district and the village,

311
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,520
and the garden district is kind of this historic area

312
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,641
that has been neglected since the war,

313
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:15,822
and it's totally bombed out.

314
00:17:17,848 --> 00:17:20,169
And this is where people who've had a bad reaction to the drug

315
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:21,050
get ostracized.

316
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:25,591
So it's this very kind of depressing area full of people

317
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:26,852
who are not stable.

318
00:17:27,712 --> 00:17:29,373
And it's war-torn.

319
00:17:29,713 --> 00:17:31,374
But it also represents real history.

320
00:17:31,514 --> 00:17:32,974
So it's kind of the honest area.

321
00:17:33,394 --> 00:17:36,035
So it was important to me that while this area is kind of sad

322
00:17:36,896 --> 00:17:40,497
and tragic, it's also kind of beautiful and

323
00:17:40,537 --> 00:17:41,638
welcoming and organic.

324
00:17:42,298 --> 00:17:45,019
And then on the other side, you have the modern area that

325
00:17:46,234 --> 00:17:47,495
people of Wellington Wells live in.

326
00:17:47,795 --> 00:17:51,477
This is like a location from that area in a bridge.

327
00:17:52,617 --> 00:17:56,439
And it's very happy and stylish, but it's

328
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:59,201
very kind of cold and disconnected

329
00:17:59,301 --> 00:18:03,543
and almost kind of off-putting with how kind

330
00:18:03,563 --> 00:18:05,564
of shiny and artificial it is.

331
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:09,166
Here's another example from the Garan District.

332
00:18:09,206 --> 00:18:11,927
This is a hermit house.

333
00:18:12,787 --> 00:18:15,189
And again, it's very dilapidated and wonky.

334
00:18:16,169 --> 00:18:17,870
This guy believes he's a secret agent

335
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,331
living in this tree house.

336
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:23,412
But it's also organic, and it's cozy.

337
00:18:23,493 --> 00:18:25,554
And because it's England, and there's rain all the time,

338
00:18:25,594 --> 00:18:26,574
there's flowers everywhere.

339
00:18:29,064 --> 00:18:31,604
And this is from the, maybe you guys have seen this

340
00:18:31,624 --> 00:18:33,485
from the intro, this is the office.

341
00:18:35,246 --> 00:18:37,366
And this kind of symbolizes the epitome

342
00:18:37,406 --> 00:18:38,787
of society and bureaucracy.

343
00:18:38,907 --> 00:18:42,068
So very stylish, but very clean and slick

344
00:18:42,248 --> 00:18:43,768
and artificial and cold.

345
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:49,730
This also applies to character design.

346
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,791
So on one side you see a wastrel.

347
00:18:51,891 --> 00:18:53,912
So this is somebody who had a bad reaction to joy

348
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:55,192
and has been kicked out of the village.

349
00:18:57,882 --> 00:18:59,885
you know, she's mentally unhinged,

350
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:02,208
but you kind of feel for her.

351
00:19:02,288 --> 00:19:03,209
She's a real person.

352
00:19:03,229 --> 00:19:05,692
And then the other side is a welly,

353
00:19:05,752 --> 00:19:07,975
so somebody who wears the masks and takes the drugs,

354
00:19:08,435 --> 00:19:11,199
and she's very vacant and frightening.

355
00:19:14,561 --> 00:19:16,302
So style also applies to lighting.

356
00:19:16,963 --> 00:19:19,525
So in the game, you can take joy, which is the drug that

357
00:19:19,585 --> 00:19:20,185
everyone takes.

358
00:19:20,245 --> 00:19:22,347
And you can see the world for how they see it.

359
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:26,030
So it was really important to push the contrast between the

360
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,531
world off of joy and on joy.

361
00:19:28,011 --> 00:19:29,512
So off of joy, it's England.

362
00:19:29,573 --> 00:19:32,275
It's cloudy and rainy and overcast.

363
00:19:32,675 --> 00:19:35,077
But then on joy, it's clear and bright and sunny.

364
00:19:35,097 --> 00:19:39,220
And the idea is that when you take joy, you blend into the

365
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:42,422
society a bit more, because you feel like how everyone

366
00:19:42,442 --> 00:19:42,863
else feels.

367
00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:44,581
But you can also kind of empathize

368
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:47,304
with why the society is addicted to this drug.

369
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,841
So, another thing that we always think about is environmental storytelling.

370
00:19:55,201 --> 00:19:58,282
So, this is storytelling through the world and not through dialogue.

371
00:19:59,442 --> 00:20:01,762
It's been a bit tricky to figure out what reads.

372
00:20:02,843 --> 00:20:05,443
We're trying to tell the story of our own specific world.

373
00:20:06,523 --> 00:20:10,865
We want to be clear, but not too hand-holdy and not too on the nose.

374
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:13,745
So, this is an example of a statue in the game.

375
00:20:13,805 --> 00:20:18,326
It's the statue of happiness, clearly selling the idea that that's what this place cares

376
00:20:18,386 --> 00:20:19,287
about over everything.

377
00:20:22,332 --> 00:20:23,133
Back to brutalism.

378
00:20:23,373 --> 00:20:27,175
So we do use brutalism in the game, but mostly for these

379
00:20:27,215 --> 00:20:29,116
kind of checkpoint bridges between areas.

380
00:20:29,536 --> 00:20:32,718
So I talked about brutalism being this rejection of

381
00:20:32,758 --> 00:20:36,640
history for the future.

382
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,802
And in our game, it literally separates the historic area

383
00:20:39,862 --> 00:20:40,903
from the modern world.

384
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,804
So it's very symbolic.

385
00:20:43,684 --> 00:20:45,205
And it prevents people from crossing

386
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:46,466
between those two areas.

387
00:20:48,855 --> 00:20:52,717
So the area that's been refurbished is mostly still

388
00:20:52,737 --> 00:20:56,198
full of old architecture, but they use new modern elements

389
00:20:56,498 --> 00:20:57,738
and they layer that on top.

390
00:20:58,238 --> 00:21:02,360
So we do a lot with signage, kind of motivational signage

391
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,620
to spell out the regime.

392
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,141
So we have these kind of plexiglass posters everywhere

393
00:21:07,161 --> 00:21:08,481
to kind of keep people perked up.

394
00:21:11,219 --> 00:21:12,139
And then we have Uncle Jack.

395
00:21:12,959 --> 00:21:15,920
And he's kind of the local celebrity of Wellington Wells.

396
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,820
And he was inspired by BBC news anchors.

397
00:21:19,921 --> 00:21:25,242
So before 1964, there was really only one channel,

398
00:21:25,262 --> 00:21:26,162
and that was the BBC.

399
00:21:26,562 --> 00:21:28,983
And he's the only channel of Wellington Wells.

400
00:21:29,403 --> 00:21:31,343
And he's an entertainer, a news anchor.

401
00:21:31,363 --> 00:21:35,124
And his primary goal is to keep everyone motivated,

402
00:21:35,284 --> 00:21:36,364
keep them moving on.

403
00:21:37,104 --> 00:21:39,045
But if you listen closely to what he talks about,

404
00:21:39,165 --> 00:21:40,725
you can learn a lot about the history.

405
00:21:41,906 --> 00:21:43,947
And he was a real actor that we filmed on a set.

406
00:21:45,108 --> 00:21:46,809
And that was really, really exciting and

407
00:21:46,829 --> 00:21:47,510
really interesting.

408
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,651
And we were a little worried about how that would blend

409
00:21:49,691 --> 00:21:50,332
into the world.

410
00:21:51,572 --> 00:21:55,435
But because we put all these effects and film grains on him

411
00:21:55,475 --> 00:21:58,877
and make it black and white, and because we're using Unreal

412
00:21:58,937 --> 00:22:02,540
and we can get really high fidelity, it actually doesn't

413
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,782
clash as much as we thought it might, doing this kind of

414
00:22:05,842 --> 00:22:06,682
mixed media thing.

415
00:22:07,163 --> 00:22:10,165
So this has been really, really fun working with an actor.

416
00:22:12,684 --> 00:22:15,166
So now we have our world of Wellington Wells, and we have

417
00:22:15,206 --> 00:22:17,107
to realize this with our procedural

418
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:18,188
generation technology.

419
00:22:19,009 --> 00:22:23,993
So the first thing we had to think about was what we wanted

420
00:22:24,053 --> 00:22:27,255
to make procedural and what we didn't want to make procedural.

421
00:22:27,756 --> 00:22:31,579
So we had to be really critical of this, because it

422
00:22:31,619 --> 00:22:34,321
doesn't benefit everything if everything is procedural.

423
00:22:34,981 --> 00:22:39,845
So the things that we decided to make procedural.

424
00:22:40,866 --> 00:22:41,326
Oops, sorry.

425
00:22:43,922 --> 00:22:44,062
Ah.

426
00:22:45,483 --> 00:22:45,683
Oops.

427
00:22:45,943 --> 00:22:49,765
So the things we decided to make procedural were like the

428
00:22:49,825 --> 00:22:53,908
road layouts, the houses, where the houses fall on the

429
00:22:53,968 --> 00:23:00,692
streets, the island shape, the island size, the decals, the

430
00:23:00,732 --> 00:23:03,274
props on the sides of buildings.

431
00:23:05,055 --> 00:23:07,656
All of this was done with the intention that if we can pull

432
00:23:07,676 --> 00:23:11,379
this off, it will encourage exploration and make the world

433
00:23:11,479 --> 00:23:12,920
feel different every time you play it.

434
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,841
And then there were things we chose to not make procedural.

435
00:23:17,541 --> 00:23:21,722
So interiors to buildings, well, the buildings themselves,

436
00:23:22,583 --> 00:23:26,964
parks, plazas, the lighting, props.

437
00:23:28,545 --> 00:23:32,606
None of this seemed to be beneficial to be procedural.

438
00:23:34,326 --> 00:23:36,667
By doing this, it would give full control

439
00:23:36,727 --> 00:23:37,948
to the artists and designers,

440
00:23:37,988 --> 00:23:39,868
and we wouldn't have to be working around this system.

441
00:23:41,357 --> 00:23:44,019
We actually did try to make interiors procedural,

442
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:48,062
but it was just too much of a headache for everybody,

443
00:23:48,282 --> 00:23:50,463
and it wasn't giving us any kind of visual benefit.

444
00:23:51,164 --> 00:23:52,905
And the designers were going nuts with that.

445
00:23:54,978 --> 00:23:57,939
So this is an example of our street, which is procedural.

446
00:23:59,239 --> 00:24:03,020
So how this works is that the artists build plots and assets.

447
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:10,443
And if it's a road tile, they give this to the many things

448
00:24:10,463 --> 00:24:12,464
they give to the programmers, which they implement.

449
00:24:12,924 --> 00:24:14,804
Or if it's kind of a plot or a

450
00:24:16,885 --> 00:24:20,606
gameplay or narrative area, that goes to the LDs before

451
00:24:20,646 --> 00:24:21,346
it's implemented.

452
00:24:21,786 --> 00:24:24,667
So artists create all the assets, and then it gets laid

453
00:24:24,707 --> 00:24:25,368
out in the system.

454
00:24:25,528 --> 00:24:28,869
And a really oversimplified way of describing how it

455
00:24:28,909 --> 00:24:32,070
works is that it lays out the road map, and then it puts

456
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:35,411
kind of the key narrative and gameplay locations that we

457
00:24:35,451 --> 00:24:37,411
know we need on that road map in the world.

458
00:24:37,892 --> 00:24:40,132
And then it fills out the space in between, and then it

459
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:44,134
layers over that the decals and assets with our decorator.

460
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:45,354
And

461
00:24:46,281 --> 00:24:49,264
The programmers have created tools for the artists, so the

462
00:24:49,304 --> 00:24:51,966
artists can control the decorator and the

463
00:24:52,006 --> 00:24:53,007
dispersion of props.

464
00:24:53,107 --> 00:24:56,851
So we can go in and control things like how high up the

465
00:24:56,891 --> 00:24:59,513
signs are on the buildings, how frequently they show up,

466
00:25:00,274 --> 00:25:03,938
where the decals and puddles fall on the streets, how far

467
00:25:03,998 --> 00:25:06,620
away the mailboxes are from the road.

468
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,523
So we do have control over those kind of elements.

469
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:13,385
And then this is an example of a handcrafted space.

470
00:25:13,485 --> 00:25:15,545
So these are interiors from our village.

471
00:25:16,326 --> 00:25:18,906
We tried to push composition and push

472
00:25:18,966 --> 00:25:21,087
all of our artistic tools in these spaces

473
00:25:21,727 --> 00:25:24,468
and also push narrative and design and everything

474
00:25:24,508 --> 00:25:25,448
we have control over.

475
00:25:25,988 --> 00:25:27,969
So here we were really trying to get

476
00:25:28,049 --> 00:25:30,490
across the strong kind of mid-century,

477
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,230
modern, stylish interior.

478
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:36,752
And we can kind of go crazy with lighting as well.

479
00:25:39,446 --> 00:25:42,527
So now I'll just give you a really rough timeline for how we

480
00:25:42,567 --> 00:25:45,027
created the village area with the procedural system.

481
00:25:46,447 --> 00:25:47,828
So we started with the concept.

482
00:25:48,008 --> 00:25:50,108
So here's the concept that I showed you earlier.

483
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:53,909
This is based off of this area I had visited as a kid called

484
00:25:53,929 --> 00:25:55,009
the Shambles in York.

485
00:25:55,789 --> 00:25:58,530
It's full of these very old Tudor buildings with lots of

486
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:01,650
character, and we thought that this would be a very iconic

487
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:04,031
British type of architecture to try to build.

488
00:26:05,911 --> 00:26:08,112
And then we do layout research to figure out.

489
00:26:08,721 --> 00:26:11,704
how these places should get laid out and what kind of

490
00:26:12,324 --> 00:26:13,605
roadmap this should be.

491
00:26:15,727 --> 00:26:19,070
And then our tech director does crazy super magic that I

492
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:24,294
cannot describe to you at all how that works, because I'm on

493
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:24,935
the art side.

494
00:26:25,295 --> 00:26:27,777
And unfortunately, he's not talking here.

495
00:26:28,017 --> 00:26:29,539
But it is very complicated.

496
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:31,000
And it works.

497
00:26:36,265 --> 00:26:37,547
So this was really, really exciting.

498
00:26:37,627 --> 00:26:40,950
So we made these temporary buildings that are very simple,

499
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:44,593
but we put them into the system, and our tech director

500
00:26:44,633 --> 00:26:46,915
was able to get curves in the street, and it actually feels

501
00:26:46,955 --> 00:26:48,617
like an actual English village.

502
00:26:49,317 --> 00:26:54,902
So this was what was reassuring to the fact that we

503
00:26:54,922 --> 00:26:57,224
can actually make this world with this system.

504
00:26:59,255 --> 00:27:02,697
So then we had to make the real buildings that we would use.

505
00:27:03,358 --> 00:27:06,180
So I went ahead and designed what we call filler buildings.

506
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,881
So these are facade buildings.

507
00:27:08,921 --> 00:27:10,122
They're just like blocks.

508
00:27:10,442 --> 00:27:15,306
And we use these to bridge between interactive gameplay

509
00:27:15,326 --> 00:27:16,146
and narrative buildings.

510
00:27:16,527 --> 00:27:18,328
So the point of these buildings is that they are

511
00:27:18,408 --> 00:27:21,750
kind of forgettable without being ugly, because we don't

512
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:24,732
want them to detract from where you need to go as a player.

513
00:27:25,573 --> 00:27:28,314
So I made them very flat and very muted.

514
00:27:30,416 --> 00:27:35,599
But we put them in the world, we built them, and they were just like way too flat and ugly

515
00:27:36,139 --> 00:27:38,640
and killed any sense of composition in the space.

516
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:46,204
And then we added our gloomy overcast lighting and it became this like really yucky, drab,

517
00:27:46,344 --> 00:27:47,304
flat place.

518
00:27:48,285 --> 00:27:51,386
But we got the decorator system working, so you can see there is a tree in the middle

519
00:27:51,406 --> 00:27:51,886
of the street.

520
00:27:54,635 --> 00:27:56,837
But yeah, we had to do something about these buildings.

521
00:27:57,977 --> 00:27:59,839
They were just too boring.

522
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,881
And we also didn't know which percentage of the world

523
00:28:02,921 --> 00:28:03,602
they would take up.

524
00:28:03,702 --> 00:28:05,784
So this was in the beginning of the project.

525
00:28:05,824 --> 00:28:08,106
And we didn't know how many design locations

526
00:28:08,146 --> 00:28:09,106
we would have in this world.

527
00:28:10,187 --> 00:28:11,168
But we kept them for a while.

528
00:28:11,869 --> 00:28:14,971
And we added atmosphere to see if that would kind of fix it.

529
00:28:16,953 --> 00:28:18,834
But now it's feeling very sickly green.

530
00:28:19,355 --> 00:28:21,396
So not only is there no composition,

531
00:28:21,476 --> 00:28:23,778
but it's very kind of sickly looking.

532
00:28:24,967 --> 00:28:29,068
But we were able to get the decorator to spawn these

533
00:28:29,548 --> 00:28:32,849
buntings going across the different buildings and kind

534
00:28:32,909 --> 00:28:35,130
of arrange the props in a way that makes sense.

535
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:37,030
So it's starting to feel a little bit better in that

536
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:37,370
sense.

537
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:40,511
So we dialed back on the sickly green and made it a bit

538
00:28:40,551 --> 00:28:41,451
more clear and blue.

539
00:28:41,591 --> 00:28:43,331
But now it was really contrasting with the joy

540
00:28:43,351 --> 00:28:46,052
mechanic, or sorry, it wasn't contrasting enough with the

541
00:28:46,092 --> 00:28:46,752
joy mechanic.

542
00:28:46,832 --> 00:28:49,873
So when you take joy, you wouldn't really notice it

543
00:28:49,913 --> 00:28:51,193
because you're already in this blue sky.

544
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:55,171
But then we got a height variation.

545
00:28:55,971 --> 00:28:57,372
So this was really cool.

546
00:28:57,452 --> 00:28:59,634
Having height variation really helped with the feeling of

547
00:28:59,694 --> 00:29:00,274
composition.

548
00:29:01,054 --> 00:29:02,895
But then we were getting issues where you have two

549
00:29:02,935 --> 00:29:06,217
buildings showing up next to each other and these kind of

550
00:29:06,317 --> 00:29:08,439
weird, awkward.

551
00:29:09,439 --> 00:29:13,002
a staggering of buildings that feels very unnatural.

552
00:29:14,123 --> 00:29:18,105
And this was the worst, these giant random gaps everywhere

553
00:29:18,386 --> 00:29:20,547
that are totally not in the real world.

554
00:29:20,987 --> 00:29:22,989
And this is for the very obvious reason

555
00:29:23,049 --> 00:29:26,351
that we have square buildings fitting into curved roads.

556
00:29:26,892 --> 00:29:29,474
So they would create these negative spaces

557
00:29:30,014 --> 00:29:32,235
that were very unnatural.

558
00:29:34,346 --> 00:29:36,708
we had to re-look at how we did the filler buildings, which

559
00:29:36,768 --> 00:29:39,210
is great, because it gave me an excuse to redesign them.

560
00:29:40,531 --> 00:29:44,475
So we created what we call our filler system, which is

561
00:29:44,675 --> 00:29:49,479
creating different buildings of various widths that, with a

562
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:53,923
high enough texture resolution, they would deform and kind of

563
00:29:54,023 --> 00:29:55,804
squish to fill the gaps.

564
00:29:56,885 --> 00:29:59,768
So I went ahead and designed some new filler buildings.

565
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:01,329
And here I was really trying to push.

566
00:30:03,437 --> 00:30:06,419
the silhouette in the buildings, and to see how interesting we

567
00:30:06,459 --> 00:30:08,560
could make them before they detract from the gameplay

568
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,001
spaces.

569
00:30:10,802 --> 00:30:13,443
And then our environment artist went ahead and built them

570
00:30:13,824 --> 00:30:14,484
and gave them.

571
00:30:15,485 --> 00:30:19,767
We always tried to push for this kind of stylized realism.

572
00:30:19,787 --> 00:30:21,869
It's very much inspired by stop motion.

573
00:30:22,489 --> 00:30:26,311
So he gave it this really great kind of spindly quality.

574
00:30:27,672 --> 00:30:29,573
So they have way more character than they had before.

575
00:30:31,254 --> 00:30:31,975
And then we put them in.

576
00:30:32,395 --> 00:30:32,495
And

577
00:30:34,818 --> 00:30:36,839
It works and this is really, really great.

578
00:30:36,979 --> 00:30:40,080
So now it actually feels like a real English village and we

579
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,260
don't have these weird unnatural gaps everywhere.

580
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:46,302
We tried to tweak the lighting to be a little less sickly, but

581
00:30:46,342 --> 00:30:47,502
it's still pretty gloomy.

582
00:30:48,402 --> 00:30:50,803
And for some reason, our decorators stopped working.

583
00:30:50,843 --> 00:30:53,024
So there's really nothing in the street anymore.

584
00:30:53,064 --> 00:30:54,804
But the fillers are working and this was really great.

585
00:30:57,134 --> 00:30:59,835
And so we tweaked the lighting to be a bit cooler, a little

586
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:00,356
more purple.

587
00:31:01,076 --> 00:31:03,738
And here you can see that the fillers are not detracting

588
00:31:03,838 --> 00:31:06,259
from the gameplay spaces that you need to go to.

589
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:07,540
So this was cool.

590
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:11,803
We learned that you can push silhouette and shape, but as

591
00:31:11,843 --> 00:31:16,406
long as you don't put lights on it or bold colors, it won't

592
00:31:16,686 --> 00:31:20,308
detract from the gameplay spaces as long as there's

593
00:31:20,368 --> 00:31:22,290
enough glowing lights on those spaces.

594
00:31:24,963 --> 00:31:27,465
But then the height variation was causing all these bugs,

595
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:31,930
which was bad because we were trying to get the build stable

596
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:32,791
for early access.

597
00:31:33,452 --> 00:31:36,035
So we had to dial back on this because we just couldn't have

598
00:31:36,075 --> 00:31:38,798
these issues in the build for our early access release.

599
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:44,064
And then the curves in the streets were creating this

600
00:31:44,104 --> 00:31:46,226
problem where filler buildings were eating.

601
00:31:46,832 --> 00:31:47,433
other buildings.

602
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:50,754
So we also had to dial back on the curves.

603
00:31:51,255 --> 00:31:54,476
So now we're kind of back to flat buildings on a grid,

604
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:57,918
which is bad, because we never wanted that.

605
00:31:59,512 --> 00:32:02,253
So what did we do to try to make this a little more interesting?

606
00:32:03,293 --> 00:32:09,556
We put a lot of love and energy into the places that we could control, so our kind of custom plots like parks.

607
00:32:10,576 --> 00:32:13,938
So this is an example of a place that we have control over.

608
00:32:14,758 --> 00:32:20,260
So we pushed the lighting and the composition and the story in these kind of areas. So in this park there is these

609
00:32:21,401 --> 00:32:26,003
toys that you can go play on and if you play on them you can kind of blend in

610
00:32:26,323 --> 00:32:28,644
temporarily if you have a mob on you.

611
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:31,996
And then we added vistas.

612
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:34,397
So I know these are quite simple vistas,

613
00:32:34,497 --> 00:32:37,379
but in England, vistas are very kind of low and rolling.

614
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,100
So this would help a lot

615
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:42,141
with bringing composition to the space.

616
00:32:43,382 --> 00:32:44,903
But we put them too close to the world,

617
00:32:45,303 --> 00:32:47,484
and they totally gobbled up the world.

618
00:32:47,564 --> 00:32:51,827
So I came into work one morning and played the build,

619
00:32:51,947 --> 00:32:55,909
and the vistas were just engulfing the whole world,

620
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:57,910
which was really startling.

621
00:32:59,065 --> 00:33:02,126
But we moved them back and they're feeling good.

622
00:33:03,226 --> 00:33:05,567
And we tweaked the lighting to be a little more purple,

623
00:33:05,927 --> 00:33:08,068
which was nice because it still felt like overcast

624
00:33:08,128 --> 00:33:09,329
and didn't detract from joy,

625
00:33:09,729 --> 00:33:11,569
but wasn't completely miserable to play in.

626
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:13,670
We added coasts.

627
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:16,331
We did a lot of research on English coasts

628
00:33:16,391 --> 00:33:17,311
and what those look like.

629
00:33:17,832 --> 00:33:18,752
And we added foliage.

630
00:33:19,092 --> 00:33:21,013
And now it's finally coming together.

631
00:33:21,033 --> 00:33:25,314
And the artists are putting lots of love

632
00:33:25,374 --> 00:33:27,915
into gameplay spaces and really...

633
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:30,620
kind of going nuts in them, which is great.

634
00:33:31,861 --> 00:33:36,783
But then we get this bug where decals or props are blocking

635
00:33:36,983 --> 00:33:39,304
gameplay spaces so you can't actually access them.

636
00:33:39,764 --> 00:33:42,485
So this is an example of another kind of unpredictable

637
00:33:42,525 --> 00:33:43,545
bug that would show up.

638
00:33:43,945 --> 00:33:48,107
And unless we play test the crap out of this game, we

639
00:33:48,868 --> 00:33:49,728
just miss this stuff.

640
00:33:51,469 --> 00:33:54,250
But we created a rule to prevent this from happening.

641
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:55,510
So now this doesn't happen so much.

642
00:33:57,590 --> 00:34:02,192
And then to add composition, we just had to think a lot

643
00:34:02,232 --> 00:34:04,753
about how we could kind of block the line of sight.

644
00:34:05,193 --> 00:34:08,014
So we put these big arches in that go over the streets.

645
00:34:09,635 --> 00:34:11,916
And that really, really helped kind of fill out the street.

646
00:34:12,376 --> 00:34:15,918
And the more kind of the props we added

647
00:34:15,978 --> 00:34:18,078
and the more things we used to block the line of sight,

648
00:34:18,458 --> 00:34:21,340
the more kind of rich and dynamic the world felt.

649
00:34:22,957 --> 00:34:23,898
So this is where we are now.

650
00:34:24,519 --> 00:34:26,462
So it's feeling good.

651
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:27,865
The architecture is working.

652
00:34:28,486 --> 00:34:29,507
The streets feel alive.

653
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,771
But we don't have height variation.

654
00:34:31,791 --> 00:34:32,512
We don't have curves.

655
00:34:33,593 --> 00:34:35,356
So what is the next step?

656
00:34:37,012 --> 00:34:39,373
well, to bring back height variation and curves.

657
00:34:40,094 --> 00:34:44,195
But we also want to create specific sections of areas.

658
00:34:44,295 --> 00:34:46,936
So in order to create more variation in the world,

659
00:34:47,437 --> 00:34:49,557
instead of everything being very homogenous,

660
00:34:50,118 --> 00:34:53,959
we would like to try to have specific commercial streets,

661
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:55,920
residential streets.

662
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,541
And in order to do that, we need to create rules.

663
00:34:58,641 --> 00:35:00,842
So this is an example of a concept I would do

664
00:35:01,002 --> 00:35:04,043
to give to our programmers, to be like,

665
00:35:04,083 --> 00:35:04,343
can we...

666
00:35:05,012 --> 00:35:07,444
Can we create these different areas and can we use these

667
00:35:07,484 --> 00:35:08,851
types of rules to kind of...

668
00:35:10,522 --> 00:35:11,963
dictate what these areas will be like.

669
00:35:12,003 --> 00:35:15,486
So if we have commercial streets, maybe the buildings

670
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:18,448
are all three to four stories tall, and they have dense

671
00:35:19,149 --> 00:35:20,029
alleyways behind them.

672
00:35:20,089 --> 00:35:21,971
If we have residential streets, maybe the buildings

673
00:35:22,011 --> 00:35:26,234
are all one to two story high, and there's always a garden

674
00:35:26,294 --> 00:35:28,936
behind them, separated by a path, and another garden.

675
00:35:29,476 --> 00:35:33,479
So we kind of have to reverse engineer the way a village

676
00:35:33,559 --> 00:35:35,161
looks and create a bunch of rules.

677
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:39,887
But we're working on this, and this is the plan.

678
00:35:40,007 --> 00:35:43,330
And I think this will really help give a sense of realism

679
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:44,371
and variation to the world.

680
00:35:44,391 --> 00:35:49,215
And then on a macro level, we would like to.

681
00:35:51,617 --> 00:35:54,560
create variation with how the entire world is designed.

682
00:35:54,961 --> 00:35:57,383
So right now, the world is just these kind of flat little

683
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:00,006
crackers all separated by bridges.

684
00:36:00,827 --> 00:36:04,090
And we would love there to be different types of land

685
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:05,792
formations in between these areas.

686
00:36:06,252 --> 00:36:08,314
Maybe the areas are separated by

687
00:36:10,989 --> 00:36:13,751
pinch points instead of bridges, maybe they're in valleys,

688
00:36:13,871 --> 00:36:15,533
maybe they're kind of on top of mountains.

689
00:36:16,033 --> 00:36:19,156
And if we're able to add this kind of variation to the world,

690
00:36:19,657 --> 00:36:22,039
then it will really feel like a different place

691
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:22,800
each time you play.

692
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,062
So this is another thing we're working on.

693
00:36:27,404 --> 00:36:28,225
So that's it.

694
00:36:28,665 --> 00:36:29,326
Thanks for coming.

695
00:36:30,126 --> 00:36:31,147
I hope you learned a lot.

696
00:36:40,467 --> 00:36:41,729
Does anyone have questions?

697
00:36:42,471 --> 00:36:45,075
I don't know how much time we have because my timer didn't

698
00:36:45,095 --> 00:36:45,295
work.

699
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:48,561
Nobody?

700
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:50,103
OK.

701
00:36:51,265 --> 00:36:51,846
