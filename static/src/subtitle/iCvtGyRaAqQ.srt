00:00:03,974 --> 00:00:07,003
Hi, and welcome to the 5th Annual GDC Animation Boot Camp.

2
00:00:07,003 --> 00:00:07,866
This is the clap part.

3
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:15,610
I'm Mike Junglee, lead animator at Volition and co-founder of the Animation Bootcamp.

4
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:20,855
And I wanted to reflect on my approach towards creating an animation community.

5
00:00:20,855 --> 00:00:25,299
It's hard to believe that five years ago there wasn't much of a game animation community

6
00:00:25,299 --> 00:00:27,721
presence here at GDC or, hell, really anywhere.

7
00:00:27,721 --> 00:00:33,868
The only time animation got talked about was by non-animators, usually about chasing after

8
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:35,389
ever more realistic facial animation.

9
00:00:35,629 --> 00:00:37,311
which would always lead to a bunch of animators

10
00:00:37,311 --> 00:00:39,853
getting salty online because after marketing,

11
00:00:39,853 --> 00:00:41,794
that was marketing talk, not process.

12
00:00:41,794 --> 00:00:43,756
After this cycle happened enough times,

13
00:00:43,756 --> 00:00:46,078
I realized we can't get those people

14
00:00:46,078 --> 00:00:47,859
to stop saying what they're selling.

15
00:00:47,859 --> 00:00:49,060
We needed our own platform, a stage.

16
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:52,583
And for developers, there are few stages larger than GDC.

17
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:54,785
So armed with my naive optimism

18
00:00:54,785 --> 00:00:57,247
and my own selfish desire to learn more,

19
00:00:57,247 --> 00:00:59,909
I reached out to animators that I knew and respected

20
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:01,671
with far more experience and talent

21
00:01:01,671 --> 00:01:03,352
to see what GDC could offer us.

22
00:01:03,592 --> 00:01:06,254
We put together a pitch, myself and seven others,

23
00:01:06,254 --> 00:01:08,074
and we got a day all to ourselves

24
00:01:08,074 --> 00:01:10,456
to define what game animation meant to us.

25
00:01:10,456 --> 00:01:13,197
After overwhelmingly positive feedback for the boot camp

26
00:01:13,197 --> 00:01:15,418
and more animators wanting to present the next year,

27
00:01:15,418 --> 00:01:17,279
we knew the train was not only on the tracks

28
00:01:17,279 --> 00:01:18,339
but barreling along.

29
00:01:18,339 --> 00:01:20,100
The next year we had 10 speakers,

30
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,781
then 11, last year 23, and this year 22,

31
00:01:22,781 --> 00:01:25,363
which tells me we've probably hit peak speakers in a day.

32
00:01:26,087 --> 00:01:29,868
In the span of five years, we went from seeing only a couple of people define what animation

33
00:01:29,868 --> 00:01:33,710
means to the industry as a whole to now dozens speaking on the topic.

34
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:37,131
And not just from the purely aesthetic side either.

35
00:01:37,131 --> 00:01:41,453
It also encompasses tech and design and all of the things that go into making characters

36
00:01:41,453 --> 00:01:41,873
come alive.

37
00:01:41,873 --> 00:01:45,714
And with this platform, the community that has grown from it has really been the best

38
00:01:45,714 --> 00:01:45,994
part.

39
00:01:45,994 --> 00:01:49,636
I look out into the crowd here and I see so many familiar faces from years past.

40
00:01:49,796 --> 00:01:53,199
The boot camp has become as much a family reunion as an educational experience. More

41
00:01:53,199 --> 00:01:57,422
important than the knowledge we walk away with, it's the bonds that make us stronger.

42
00:01:57,422 --> 00:02:01,825
But growing it beyond just this one day is necessary. Yes, we all have our various social

43
00:02:01,825 --> 00:02:06,428
media networks to stay connected, but how do we capture the enthusiasm and inspiration

44
00:02:06,428 --> 00:02:11,412
past one day a year? How do we get more people involved? Ideally, I want everyone that loves

45
00:02:11,412 --> 00:02:13,193
what we love to be involved in this.

46
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:16,367
I recently read Thank You for Being Late by Thomas Friedman,

47
00:02:16,367 --> 00:02:19,891
which really cemented my mindset when it comes to information sharing.

48
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:23,235
In a world where everything is accelerating at the speed of Moore's Law,

49
00:02:23,235 --> 00:02:27,140
fully embracing the speed of change is how you adapt and grow in our craft.

50
00:02:28,643 --> 00:02:31,785
The days of getting good at one thing and living off that thing for the rest of your

51
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:32,905
life are passing us by.

52
00:02:32,905 --> 00:02:37,326
The rate of how quickly things change means we need to be continually learning and growing

53
00:02:37,326 --> 00:02:38,207
our craft.

54
00:02:38,207 --> 00:02:42,288
You can complain about the good old days when all animators had to do was just sit down

55
00:02:42,288 --> 00:02:46,910
and open up Maya or Max or whatever and animate, but that's akin to doggy paddling in white

56
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,070
water rapids.

57
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,871
We all need to learn how to ride a kayak.

58
00:02:49,871 --> 00:02:51,632
Hell, maybe even a skiff.

59
00:02:51,792 --> 00:02:55,513
And because all of this can be a scary thing for someone to do on their own and businesses

60
00:02:55,513 --> 00:03:00,174
that thrive and make money off of the old approach of taking that knowledge and walling

61
00:03:00,174 --> 00:03:04,535
it off and owning it are often too afraid, slow or unwilling to help, it's up to us,

62
00:03:04,535 --> 00:03:08,316
the community, to help each other out. To provide the tools and knowledge needed to

63
00:03:08,316 --> 00:03:12,138
keep us all from gulping down water when there are boats all around us that we can get into

64
00:03:12,138 --> 00:03:17,039
and ride this information wave together. And this here is where all of that starts.

65
00:03:17,279 --> 00:03:19,443
At GDC today, we have the boot camp,

66
00:03:19,443 --> 00:03:21,967
which has 22 speakers across 10 blocks of talks

67
00:03:21,967 --> 00:03:24,411
with five and a half hours of knowledge sharing overall.

68
00:03:24,411 --> 00:03:26,794
Every talk in here speaks to the different approaches

69
00:03:26,794 --> 00:03:28,858
and skills needed by different animators

70
00:03:28,858 --> 00:03:31,582
across the industry to bring a character to life.

71
00:03:32,954 --> 00:03:34,055
And during the main conference,

72
00:03:34,055 --> 00:03:36,356
there are even more animation talks, as you see here.

73
00:03:36,356 --> 00:03:37,837
Since the bootcamp is only one day,

74
00:03:37,837 --> 00:03:39,838
but the enthusiasm to share is so large,

75
00:03:39,838 --> 00:03:43,060
more and more talks are appearing at the main conference.

76
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,841
I'll personally be practicing what I preach

77
00:03:44,841 --> 00:03:46,742
on Wednesday morning at 9.30 a.m.

78
00:03:46,742 --> 00:03:48,643
about Agents of Mayhem in the West Hall.

79
00:03:48,643 --> 00:03:50,684
And while we're lucky to be here,

80
00:03:50,684 --> 00:03:52,145
this is only a fraction of the larger

81
00:03:52,145 --> 00:03:54,607
game animation community who couldn't be here.

82
00:03:54,607 --> 00:03:57,368
And democratization of knowledge is a key component

83
00:03:57,368 --> 00:03:59,790
of staying afloat with the wave of accelerations.

84
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:04,951
The first step to help them all out is to take pictures and notes of everything you see and share those with the hashtag GDCAnim.

85
00:04:04,951 --> 00:04:09,432
The second step is the animation exchange happening tomorrow in partnership with Twitch,

86
00:04:09,432 --> 00:04:16,274
in which we've programmed eight more hours of all-new talks with over 30 speakers to be streamed free and live to anyone with an internet connection.

87
00:04:16,274 --> 00:04:20,835
Tomorrow from 2 to 10 p.m. Pacific Time, animation is taking over Twitch.

88
00:04:21,455 --> 00:04:25,198
Animation Exchange is the perfect example of adapting to the needs of the community

89
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:29,422
because getting two days at GDC hasn't been possible and the outcry for more talks and

90
00:04:29,422 --> 00:04:32,685
more affordable options is one that has not gone unheard by all of us.

91
00:04:32,685 --> 00:04:36,848
And Twitch has been gracious enough to fully support our vision of open knowledge sharing.

92
00:04:37,129 --> 00:04:41,275
And then past that we have animstate.com which we've envisioned as a hub for all things game

93
00:04:41,275 --> 00:04:45,762
animation online. I know we sort of dropped the ball with this last year so this year we've

94
00:04:45,762 --> 00:04:50,410
reached out to more of the community to help because many hands lift all boats if you'll

95
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:52,113
forgive me mixing my metaphors here.

96
00:04:53,403 --> 00:04:56,925
And if you have a strong vision for what you want this community to be or you want to get

97
00:04:56,925 --> 00:05:00,848
more involved, there's nothing stopping you. This all started with one person reaching out to

98
00:05:00,848 --> 00:05:07,471
seven others. We decided to build a boat, join in arms and take a ride down the river. And now

99
00:05:07,471 --> 00:05:12,974
none of us will ever let go, Jack. So if you feel like you're treading water as it rises all

100
00:05:12,974 --> 00:05:17,096
around you, this is where you can find your life raft. This is where you can find your

101
00:05:17,096 --> 00:05:21,799
community. Come aboard. We're expecting you. Thanks and enjoy the show.

102
00:05:32,835 --> 00:05:33,955
I'm panicking, guys.

103
00:05:33,955 --> 00:05:34,075
Thanks.

104
00:05:34,075 --> 00:05:35,396
I mean, I know, but how does this work?

105
00:05:35,396 --> 00:05:36,176
The mouse isn't... it's a track pad.

106
00:05:36,176 --> 00:05:36,476
Oh, God.

107
00:05:36,476 --> 00:05:41,218
I read off my phone again, because that's how I always practice, because I only have

108
00:05:41,218 --> 00:05:41,838
one monitor.

109
00:05:41,838 --> 00:05:42,938
So, you'll forgive me here, getting set up.

110
00:05:59,843 --> 00:06:04,085
All right. I'm going to be talking to you about how all students know nothing and all

111
00:06:04,085 --> 00:06:10,788
game devs are jerks. It's easy to spot a student. Like Neo finally seeing the code of the matrix

112
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:16,310
you see the pattern. The same questions over and over again. You get used to being accosted

113
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:20,892
for feedback and in turn used to hearing why that feedback is wrong. And in time you'll

114
00:06:20,892 --> 00:06:23,193
come to peace with simply tuning the stupid out.

115
00:06:24,012 --> 00:06:26,834
But students, don't be discouraged because you're undereducated.

116
00:06:26,834 --> 00:06:31,057
Everything's okay because all working developers are assholes anyway.

117
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:31,638
Trust me.

118
00:06:31,638 --> 00:06:34,880
Furthermore, they're easy to spot too.

119
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,682
Conversations are tediously one-sided.

120
00:06:36,682 --> 00:06:41,126
Everything you say is wrong in some way and there is no tolerance for your inexperience.

121
00:06:41,784 --> 00:06:45,186
Devs spend more time checking Twitter than making eye contact.

122
00:06:45,186 --> 00:06:48,468
And you start to recognize they're already too salty about the industry to really be

123
00:06:48,468 --> 00:06:50,108
worth the time it takes to flag them down.

124
00:06:50,108 --> 00:06:54,911
You should be at ease knowing that you're younger, hungrier, and typically nicer than

125
00:06:54,911 --> 00:06:55,131
they are.

126
00:06:55,131 --> 00:06:55,251
Okay.

127
00:06:55,251 --> 00:06:57,372
We're off to a bit of a rough start here, but can you blame me?

128
00:06:57,372 --> 00:07:03,255
I can all but guarantee that everyone in this room has felt some semblance of these impressions

129
00:07:03,255 --> 00:07:04,876
at this point in their career.

130
00:07:04,876 --> 00:07:07,277
And if you haven't, well, this could be the week for you.

131
00:07:08,308 --> 00:07:12,611
I would like to know who, as a developer, please participate, has been fed up and maybe

132
00:07:12,611 --> 00:07:16,253
a little sad after having left a confrontation with a student.

133
00:07:16,253 --> 00:07:17,253
Yeah, come on.

134
00:07:17,253 --> 00:07:21,655
And students, past or present, who has wound up in a precious conversation with a working

135
00:07:21,655 --> 00:07:24,016
dev only to leave thinking, fuck that guy.

136
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:27,446
Where have these sentiments even come from?

137
00:07:27,446 --> 00:07:31,729
I am in this unique headspace right now where I can vividly recall feeling the crushing

138
00:07:31,729 --> 00:07:35,711
disappointment of meeting a developer who didn't give me the time of day and yet I still

139
00:07:35,711 --> 00:07:39,954
presently find myself capable of seeing students around and thinking, ugh, I just don't want

140
00:07:39,954 --> 00:07:41,014
to deal with this right now.

141
00:07:41,014 --> 00:07:46,398
Does anybody else remember the roundtables of three years ago, the students versus developers

142
00:07:46,398 --> 00:07:46,898
civil war?

143
00:07:47,692 --> 00:07:52,413
Well, to me, it's painfully memorable as a time I watched a community I longed to be a part of,

144
00:07:52,413 --> 00:07:57,414
verbally thrash and tacitly label a community I was still a part of as uneducated millennials,

145
00:07:57,414 --> 00:08:00,495
without questioning for a second whether or not they may have been a little out of touch.

146
00:08:00,495 --> 00:08:05,056
And I've seen many more students harassing developers in the middle of important,

147
00:08:05,056 --> 00:08:07,216
even private conversations with their peers,

148
00:08:07,216 --> 00:08:09,737
who've clearly slipped away for five seconds of alone time

149
00:08:09,737 --> 00:08:13,338
and felt myself cringe thinking how exhausting it must be to be here,

150
00:08:13,338 --> 00:08:17,159
and how tragic they no longer get to experience this in a carefree, self-indulgent way.

151
00:08:18,209 --> 00:08:20,010
Nobody wants to act like this.

152
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:21,751
Students are obviously trying to learn,

153
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,912
and as a dev, I know I do want to help.

154
00:08:23,912 --> 00:08:27,955
But if someone comes up to me asking, how do I animate?

155
00:08:27,955 --> 00:08:30,056
I get annoyed, and I've pretty much typecast myself

156
00:08:30,056 --> 00:08:32,258
as the permanent freshman around here.

157
00:08:32,258 --> 00:08:33,838
So what do we do?

158
00:08:33,838 --> 00:08:35,920
Well, as Mike just mentioned, this community

159
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,601
is still relatively new, and that means change is possible,

160
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:39,342
if not inevitable.

161
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:42,783
If I can do something to help even a few people in this room today,

162
00:08:42,783 --> 00:08:46,964
I'd like to think it'll eventually snowball into a brighter tomorrow.

163
00:08:46,964 --> 00:08:51,085
So I want to help students, or anyone eagerly looking to level up their career,

164
00:08:51,085 --> 00:08:54,366
talk to other professionals in less confrontational ways,

165
00:08:54,366 --> 00:08:57,127
and I want to help devs speak to students without being exhausted

166
00:08:57,127 --> 00:08:59,447
or inadvertently making ourselves out to be jerks.

167
00:08:59,447 --> 00:09:00,668
So, students.

168
00:09:01,557 --> 00:09:02,577
Get over it.

169
00:09:02,577 --> 00:09:04,078
There's no shortcut for hard work.

170
00:09:04,078 --> 00:09:06,359
That means stop asking for them.

171
00:09:06,359 --> 00:09:08,080
Don't ask about the pencils someone's using

172
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,700
with an inclination.

173
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,702
It's the tools they use that got them where they are.

174
00:09:11,702 --> 00:09:13,723
I spent my entire education studying Maya

175
00:09:13,723 --> 00:09:15,063
and I haven't opened that program

176
00:09:15,063 --> 00:09:17,925
for more than one minute in three years.

177
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:19,125
Meanwhile, as a professional,

178
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,427
there's a certain part of your career you take for granted

179
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:23,688
simply because you're naturally inclined to work hard at it.

180
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:26,429
Please do your best to have patience.

181
00:09:26,429 --> 00:09:28,410
Aren't you here to learn too?

182
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:30,791
How much did you learn only after you got your first job?

183
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:34,071
Plus, if you don't want there to be so many students bugging you,

184
00:09:34,071 --> 00:09:36,932
then maybe there should be more entry-level jobs.

185
00:09:36,932 --> 00:09:39,234
I know that's not necessarily up to anyone here,

186
00:09:39,234 --> 00:09:41,215
but I bet a lot of this grief would go away

187
00:09:41,215 --> 00:09:42,756
with opening an appropriate outlet.

188
00:09:42,756 --> 00:09:45,578
Students could be like, hey, OK, I get it.

189
00:09:45,578 --> 00:09:46,178
I'm new.

190
00:09:46,178 --> 00:09:47,399
I don't know a lot.

191
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:48,960
But I'm not desperate, all right?

192
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,581
At least I'm working.

193
00:09:50,581 --> 00:09:52,963
We can sculpt these noobs into the kind of colleagues

194
00:09:52,963 --> 00:09:53,943
we want to work with.

195
00:09:54,989 --> 00:09:56,590
Students, I know it's scarce out there,

196
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:59,571
but desperation's not attractive on anybody.

197
00:09:59,571 --> 00:10:00,912
Learn to read the room.

198
00:10:00,912 --> 00:10:03,713
There is a time and a place for serious reviewing.

199
00:10:03,713 --> 00:10:06,054
Leave the tablet in the hotel room for the night.

200
00:10:06,054 --> 00:10:07,995
Definitely leave the 30-pound pro gaming laptop

201
00:10:07,995 --> 00:10:08,915
in the room for the night.

202
00:10:09,647 --> 00:10:13,632
Yeah, we see you standing at the end of the bar waiting for someone to come get a drink alone

203
00:10:13,632 --> 00:10:17,177
so you can pounce on them for feedback and please, maybe a job?

204
00:10:17,177 --> 00:10:21,302
There are other important parts to working as a professional that don't involve your reel,

205
00:10:21,302 --> 00:10:24,927
and typically places like GDC are better for making those kinds of connections.

206
00:10:25,908 --> 00:10:28,732
And devs, try to remember where you came from.

207
00:10:28,732 --> 00:10:32,616
I'm not saying you need to become best friends with someone 15 years younger than you, but

208
00:10:32,616 --> 00:10:36,781
think about what even five minutes of conversation could mean to them, where no matter what is

209
00:10:36,781 --> 00:10:40,686
on your resume, the mere fact you have a job makes you an idol to them.

210
00:10:40,686 --> 00:10:42,108
Don't be the kind they regret meeting.

211
00:10:43,023 --> 00:10:48,525
Obviously, this is all rather over the top, extreme language into response to this community's

212
00:10:48,525 --> 00:10:52,447
collection of horror stories, but it's first thing Monday morning and what a better way

213
00:10:52,447 --> 00:10:56,869
to get the blood pumping than trying your hand at insulting a room of your betters.

214
00:10:56,869 --> 00:11:01,051
But from this, it is my utmost desire that this week you take a look at the folks around

215
00:11:01,051 --> 00:11:05,053
you, not just your buddies from years back, and maybe make some connections you might

216
00:11:05,053 --> 00:11:06,133
not have otherwise made.

217
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,580
I'm talking meaningful interactions.

218
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,860
Don't just network.

219
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,921
Don't fucking network.

220
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:12,141
Talk to people.

221
00:11:12,141 --> 00:11:13,201
Be interested in them.

222
00:11:13,201 --> 00:11:13,581
Get to know them.

223
00:11:13,581 --> 00:11:14,202
Talk to me.

224
00:11:14,202 --> 00:11:18,563
I'm in the first talk of the week and I have nothing better to do after this.

225
00:11:18,563 --> 00:11:21,463
There were a lot of closed doors in 2016.

226
00:11:21,463 --> 00:11:24,264
Let's start this year by opening a few in return.

227
00:11:24,264 --> 00:11:25,164
My name is Lana Byszynski.

228
00:11:25,164 --> 00:11:27,825
I'm an animator at Blizzard Entertainment for Heroes of the Storm.

229
00:11:27,825 --> 00:11:28,425
Thank you very much.

230
00:11:44,167 --> 00:11:45,728
Oh, right. This is, I guess, the first slide.

231
00:11:45,728 --> 00:11:45,968
All right.

232
00:11:45,968 --> 00:11:48,429
All right, so I'm Matt Kahn. I'm CEO of MidBoss,

233
00:11:48,429 --> 00:11:51,911
and we do a couple different projects.

234
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:55,053
Recently, our game, Read Only Memories, just went on PS4 and PC.

235
00:11:55,053 --> 00:11:57,494
We also run the gaming convention,

236
00:11:57,494 --> 00:11:59,775
the LGBT gaming convention, Gamer X.

237
00:12:01,211 --> 00:12:06,717
So today I'm going to talk a little bit about just political messaging and kind of how you

238
00:12:06,717 --> 00:12:10,240
go about pushing your message and if it's better to do it in an overt way or if it's

239
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,225
better to be subliminal and what the costs are associated with each. Basically weighing

240
00:12:15,225 --> 00:12:18,428
the best way to get your message out while also weighing the market.

241
00:12:18,869 --> 00:12:24,212
To do so, we're going to be looking at the implementation of marginalized voices and underrepresented themes in interactive media

242
00:12:24,212 --> 00:12:27,274
and how strongly they're emphasized or prioritized.

243
00:12:27,274 --> 00:12:31,097
Other mediums are doing this well. This is not new.

244
00:12:31,097 --> 00:12:37,882
If you look at TV shows or comics, a lot of other mediums are actually doing subversive work really well.

245
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:42,725
For instance, with Empire, on Fox, you have a gay POC who's...

246
00:12:43,145 --> 00:12:48,491
an on-camera lead in Jamal. And despite being a show about hip-hop and big celebrities,

247
00:12:48,491 --> 00:12:52,756
it also works in intersectionality and deals with issues like mental health and complex

248
00:12:52,756 --> 00:12:57,942
queer issues. With Steven Universe, this is another show that I think is doing subversive

249
00:12:57,942 --> 00:13:02,427
political really well. At the surface, it may seem like a show about a young boy fighting

250
00:13:02,427 --> 00:13:03,948
evil, but actually deals with

251
00:13:04,249 --> 00:13:09,251
lesbian space rocks and non-traditional living relationship.

252
00:13:09,251 --> 00:13:12,212
That definitely is something that was not worn on the surface.

253
00:13:12,212 --> 00:13:16,775
Even stuff like Young Avengers, it's a comic book, they fight evil, they fight crime.

254
00:13:16,775 --> 00:13:22,878
But it also deals with, there's numerous queer characters and it showcases their lives in a way that is not othering.

255
00:13:22,878 --> 00:13:25,819
It's very kind of like, yeah, they're just another part of the team.

256
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:31,001
But when you do games, you have to be careful about how you put your political messaging. If

257
00:13:31,001 --> 00:13:34,562
you're too overt, you're only going to hit a certain audience. And when you only hit that

258
00:13:34,562 --> 00:13:40,403
certain audience, that audience, you're limiting yourself to a very specific niche of people.

259
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:45,824
With games like Mario is Missing, you could say that their messaging was overt, but

260
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:50,665
probably only hit a certain specific audience. Even with games like My Ex-Boyfriend the

261
00:13:50,665 --> 00:13:54,846
Space Tyrant, this is a good example of a game that's very overt with its political messaging

262
00:13:54,846 --> 00:13:56,567
in that it's clearly what the...

263
00:13:56,647 --> 00:14:01,850
the creator wanted to create, but people who might not be outside of the intended audience

264
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:07,895
probably would not play that game. So a good subversive game theoretically is a game like

265
00:14:07,895 --> 00:14:12,418
Mafia 3 because even though it's a pretty cut and dry crime game, it introduces themes

266
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:17,422
like racism through the gaming play style. So like when you commit crimes in white neighborhoods,

267
00:14:17,422 --> 00:14:18,243
the police come faster.

268
00:14:18,944 --> 00:14:23,931
like that. Games like Overwatch, which is a first‑person competitive shooting game, also

269
00:14:23,931 --> 00:14:28,618
showcases a globalist team of do‑gooders. Their unity and friendship across social and

270
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:33,185
economic bounds is kind of a political statement in itself. And also Tracer just came out,

271
00:14:33,185 --> 00:14:33,866
which is pretty cool.

272
00:14:34,867 --> 00:14:39,570
even games like Mortal Kombat 10, even though it's a hyper violent game you have female

273
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:44,635
characters that are top tier fighters and they even have a gay character who is referenced in

274
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:49,879
the story and he's still a badass and killer like all the other ones but he's just cool and

275
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:52,321
badass but also he's gay and proud of it.

276
00:14:53,707 --> 00:14:57,529
So really quick, I want to show you another, so I talked about some subversive games, but I

277
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:01,511
also want to talk about post-struggle games. So these are games that kind of jump over the

278
00:15:01,511 --> 00:15:05,213
political ramifications of a lot of their choices. And usually they're made by younger

279
00:15:05,213 --> 00:15:09,675
designers. So like in games like Stardew Valley, you can just kind of marry anyone you want. Or

280
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:14,557
in Undertale, there are sexual characters, asexual characters and gay characters and poly

281
00:15:14,557 --> 00:15:19,860
characters, a wide range of people. And so while this is great, there's definitely some issues

282
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,761
in that it doesn't directly address any of the problems. It just kind of...

283
00:15:23,043 --> 00:15:25,702
moves past them, jumps over those issues.

284
00:15:26,412 --> 00:15:30,614
that we live in. However, these can also be great because it shows young people a better world,

285
00:15:30,614 --> 00:15:35,416
a world where there's potential realities. So if you look at a game like Burrito Galaxy 65,

286
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:39,398
they have a non-binary lead and they're just treated as another person in the game. That's

287
00:15:39,398 --> 00:15:42,960
something that's really cool for young people to be able to look at and be like, oh, cool, I

288
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:47,002
can see that world. So I think there's benefits and negatives to doing post-struggle things.

289
00:15:47,002 --> 00:15:51,204
So we do a couple of different things. We run Gamer X, the LGBT focused gaming convention.

290
00:15:51,204 --> 00:15:53,225
We've learned there's a lot of different ways.

291
00:15:53,345 --> 00:15:57,590
that you can actually bring people in. We do stuff like genital bathrooms and having

292
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:01,936
pronoun stickers and stuff like that. It's really low cost and it actually allows you to get a

293
00:16:01,936 --> 00:16:04,539
lot of benefit because it brings a lot of people in who might not be interested.

294
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:10,368
With our game Read Only Memories, we use a lot of the same tactics where we have things like

295
00:16:10,368 --> 00:16:13,690
gender pronouns and things like that at the beginning of the game that don't really affect

296
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:17,731
the gameplay of most players, but for the people that actually use those things, they feel

297
00:16:17,731 --> 00:16:22,193
that much more engaged and feel like they're part of that world and that they belong there.

298
00:16:22,193 --> 00:16:27,956
Generally, I say if you're making games, try to put in a political message, if you want to,

299
00:16:27,956 --> 00:16:30,417
because people generally like things with a message.

300
00:16:30,637 --> 00:16:35,258
there's a very loud minority that say we don't want politics in games but games are art and

301
00:16:35,258 --> 00:16:41,200
like any art politics are part of it. Subversive can be very appealing because when we make

302
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,520
games and for a lot of people if you want to make things as I was saying earlier if your

303
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:48,401
political messaging is too overt potentially it might not reach that same audience. So when

304
00:16:48,401 --> 00:16:51,902
you make things that are subversive you can kind of reach a wide audience and kind of slip

305
00:16:51,902 --> 00:16:56,263
your message in. However subversive can be negative because sometimes when you're too

306
00:16:56,263 --> 00:16:59,824
subversive you're actually perpetuating a lot of the same issues and stereotypes that you're

307
00:16:59,824 --> 00:17:00,364
saying that you.

308
00:17:01,044 --> 00:17:04,547
trying to fight against. And a lot of times if you're trying to make your characters too

309
00:17:04,547 --> 00:17:08,250
mainstream, you're actually kind of taking away what makes them special and telling them

310
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:12,193
they just need to be like everyone else. But ultimately only you know you. You've got to

311
00:17:12,193 --> 00:17:17,697
decide what you want to make and what matters to you. And you need to decide if you want to

312
00:17:17,697 --> 00:17:20,779
try to make a game that makes money or if you really want to make a political message. And

313
00:17:20,779 --> 00:17:25,642
only you know what you're willing to drop off a little bit and add a little bit more.

314
00:17:26,403 --> 00:17:28,583
But yeah, I mean, I think just have confidence in yourself.

315
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:32,564
But in general, make what feels right, figure out your goals,

316
00:17:32,564 --> 00:17:34,405
what you want to say and achieve, but also allow for

317
00:17:34,405 --> 00:17:38,586
agility, and I think you'll have a good time.

318
00:17:38,586 --> 00:17:42,166
You can reach me at MattCon, M-A-T-T-C-O-N-N, and I really

319
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:49,608
appreciate letting me be part of this.

320
00:17:49,608 --> 00:17:49,868
Thanks.

321
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:50,828
OK.

322
00:17:50,828 --> 00:17:54,049
Bringing fans into the development fray, my name is

323
00:17:54,049 --> 00:17:54,349
Mariel.

324
00:17:56,193 --> 00:18:01,476
So, I work at Lab Zero Games as the lead animator and art director.

325
00:18:01,476 --> 00:18:06,578
And at our studio, we've had the experience of crowdfunding a game and a half.

326
00:18:06,578 --> 00:18:14,221
We funded DLC for Skullgirls and we got funding for our next game after Skullgirls called Indivisible, which we're working on now.

327
00:18:14,221 --> 00:18:21,144
So, you might know that part of the deal in crowdfunding is that your backers expect a certain level of transparency.

328
00:18:21,979 --> 00:18:24,382
In exchange for making your game happen,

329
00:18:24,382 --> 00:18:26,865
many of them want a look behind the curtain

330
00:18:26,865 --> 00:18:28,627
to see how it's all done.

331
00:18:28,627 --> 00:18:30,269
And teams take a lot of different approaches

332
00:18:30,269 --> 00:18:31,751
to transparency.

333
00:18:31,751 --> 00:18:33,933
Some provide write-ups and emails,

334
00:18:33,933 --> 00:18:35,575
some provide gameplay videos,

335
00:18:35,575 --> 00:18:37,257
some stream their development,

336
00:18:37,257 --> 00:18:38,859
and some provide nothing

337
00:18:38,859 --> 00:18:40,822
and they run far, far away with your money.

338
00:18:42,077 --> 00:18:44,858
For us, though, we like to stream development

339
00:18:44,858 --> 00:18:48,660
whenever someone has a couple uninterrupted hours to spare.

340
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,501
So we'll stream ourselves working on whatever it is

341
00:18:51,501 --> 00:18:54,643
we're doing to Twitch for anyone to come out and hang out

342
00:18:54,643 --> 00:18:55,984
and chat.

343
00:18:55,984 --> 00:18:58,245
For me, as animator, that means I

344
00:18:58,245 --> 00:19:00,346
get to stream myself animating.

345
00:19:00,346 --> 00:19:02,267
I don't get to do it as much as I'd like,

346
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:04,948
but I actually really enjoy streaming

347
00:19:04,948 --> 00:19:07,429
because it helps me focus when I know people are watching.

348
00:19:07,429 --> 00:19:11,151
No more one minute that turned into maybe 10 minute Twitter

349
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:11,311
breaks.

350
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:18,375
It also helps people learn exactly what goes into making our games with no actual effort

351
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:19,435
on my part.

352
00:19:19,435 --> 00:19:22,036
I'm just letting them watch my screen while I do it.

353
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:26,158
I think it takes a lot of the mystery out of it so that people better understand our

354
00:19:26,158 --> 00:19:27,659
process.

355
00:19:27,659 --> 00:19:31,641
Like, for our games in particular, which are 2D hand-animated games.

356
00:19:32,445 --> 00:19:37,809
People would think they're like Newgrounds flash animations or that the computer magically

357
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:39,490
makes in-betweens for us.

358
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:45,275
So when I stream, they actually get to see me painstakingly draw every stupid frame.

359
00:19:45,275 --> 00:19:51,399
And also what's nice about having another dozen or hundred pair of eyes is that sometimes

360
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:53,921
the chat will spot things that you don't.

361
00:19:53,921 --> 00:19:57,704
Which is kind of hard to admit because of course you think you know everything, but

362
00:19:57,704 --> 00:19:59,625
also I found that there were times that I didn't.

363
00:20:01,012 --> 00:20:06,537
I was animating a taunt for one of our characters in Skullgirls named Valentine, where she sucked

364
00:20:06,537 --> 00:20:07,278
on a lollipop.

365
00:20:07,278 --> 00:20:15,585
But then the viewers chimed in and said, Valentine, her official bio actually says that she hates

366
00:20:15,585 --> 00:20:17,748
candy, so she wouldn't have a lollipop.

367
00:20:17,748 --> 00:20:21,831
And I had actually completely forgotten, and so I had to change it to a chocolate bar.

368
00:20:23,813 --> 00:20:27,396
I was animating a wrestling move for one of our characters, Beowulf.

369
00:20:27,396 --> 00:20:31,920
I had keyed out poses that were physically possible, but as I started to actually animate

370
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:36,684
them, I ended up animating his arms in a motion that wasn't physically possible.

371
00:20:36,684 --> 00:20:40,127
And I didn't even realize it until the chap kept yelling at me.

372
00:20:41,504 --> 00:20:47,110
And we have this character, Sara Bella, who has giant sentient arms on her head that when

373
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:50,914
they're not the focus of the animation, I kind of fudge what they're doing.

374
00:20:50,914 --> 00:20:55,339
In one animation, I had accidentally started to animate the arms clipping through a hoop

375
00:20:55,339 --> 00:20:58,463
she was sitting on and the chat helped me figure out a solution.

376
00:20:59,373 --> 00:21:02,516
And just generally, opening up your work,

377
00:21:02,516 --> 00:21:05,218
to let them chime in, you can actually learn things

378
00:21:05,218 --> 00:21:06,339
that you didn't know about.

379
00:21:06,339 --> 00:21:08,481
I learned about wrestling moves for Beowulf,

380
00:21:08,481 --> 00:21:11,043
or someone can chime in and comment on the music

381
00:21:11,043 --> 00:21:14,246
I'm playing and I can learn about something else.

382
00:21:14,246 --> 00:21:17,128
But it's not all fun and games and getting work done.

383
00:21:17,128 --> 00:21:19,130
It's easy to fall under the trap of not getting

384
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:21,953
anything done because you got sucked into the chat.

385
00:21:21,953 --> 00:21:23,854
You definitely need to resist the temptation

386
00:21:23,854 --> 00:21:25,356
of jumping in to talk to everyone,

387
00:21:25,356 --> 00:21:26,917
even though it's nice to be engaged.

388
00:21:27,881 --> 00:21:31,183
You also need to be aware of what you can and can't stream

389
00:21:31,183 --> 00:21:33,584
or what's even interesting enough to stream.

390
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:35,445
Sometimes my work is just organizing files

391
00:21:35,445 --> 00:21:37,225
or writing emails and that's no fun.

392
00:21:37,225 --> 00:21:39,006
And you don't want to stream big spoilers either

393
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,767
because you want your players to have something new

394
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:41,748
to look forward to.

395
00:21:41,748 --> 00:21:44,449
These are just a few of my experiences

396
00:21:44,449 --> 00:21:47,410
but the overall impact it's had has been really beneficial

397
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:50,191
to our games and the communities around them.

398
00:21:50,191 --> 00:21:52,933
We get new people all the time who just saw a retweet

399
00:21:52,933 --> 00:21:55,094
of a stream happening and get introduced to our work.

400
00:21:56,167 --> 00:21:58,908
Because of that and our willingness to engage

401
00:21:58,908 --> 00:22:02,269
and open up to anyone willing to listen and watch,

402
00:22:02,269 --> 00:22:04,671
I think we've built a really solid community

403
00:22:04,671 --> 00:22:06,551
around both our games and our team

404
00:22:06,551 --> 00:22:08,812
with new people coming in all the time.

405
00:22:08,812 --> 00:22:11,234
And it's rewarding for me too

406
00:22:11,234 --> 00:22:13,235
to see people engaging with our work,

407
00:22:13,235 --> 00:22:14,915
even when it's boring stuff like me

408
00:22:14,915 --> 00:22:17,176
trying to figure out how to draw a hand.

409
00:22:17,176 --> 00:22:19,217
And it's a nice excuse to tell my coworkers

410
00:22:19,217 --> 00:22:20,898
not to bother me because I can shout back

411
00:22:20,898 --> 00:22:22,679
that I'm streaming so they need to leave me alone.

412
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:27,273
And hopefully, by being transparent about our process,

413
00:22:27,273 --> 00:22:29,875
we can also encourage newcomers to start creating

414
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:32,536
their own games, since now they've seen a huge part

415
00:22:32,536 --> 00:22:36,378
of what goes into game development by watching us stream.

416
00:22:36,378 --> 00:22:38,520
And I think that when we get more people

417
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,001
becoming interested in creating new

418
00:22:41,001 --> 00:22:44,283
and different types of games, we all benefit.

419
00:22:44,283 --> 00:22:46,424
Whether you're a developer or a fan,

420
00:22:46,424 --> 00:22:48,446
more games and more communities around them

421
00:22:48,446 --> 00:22:50,687
means more stuff for all of us to play.

422
00:22:51,638 --> 00:22:53,698
My name is Meryl Cartwright. That was my micro talk. Thank you.

423
00:22:53,698 --> 00:22:59,260
Okay. Let's do this thing. Hi, everybody. I'm Matthew Russell. I've made games for Valve

424
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,080
and Epic and now Amazon Game Studios. I'm here today to talk to you about engaging with

425
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,201
your community, especially when your community thinks something that you've done to your

426
00:23:04,201 --> 00:23:05,021
game, like an update, DLC, or patch.

427
00:23:22,013 --> 00:23:27,435
really, really sucks. To do this we need to take a step back and see what community was like way

428
00:23:27,435 --> 00:23:33,137
back in olden days before DLC, before weekly updates, before games as a service, before user

429
00:23:33,137 --> 00:23:38,019
generated content, hell before games were even video games to have a community around.

430
00:23:39,911 --> 00:23:44,156
Back then, a person or a group of people made a thing like a movie or a TV show.

431
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:46,879
That thing went out into the world to be consumed.

432
00:23:46,879 --> 00:23:49,322
People bought it and they consumed it.

433
00:23:49,322 --> 00:23:53,827
The closest to a back and forth dialogue were reviews by people who had their own TV shows

434
00:23:53,827 --> 00:23:55,870
to basically tell you if something sucked.

435
00:23:56,583 --> 00:24:02,267
Then in the late 70s and early 80s, we finally saw the rise of video games, first on consoles

436
00:24:02,267 --> 00:24:03,068
and then on home PCs.

437
00:24:03,068 --> 00:24:07,491
But like other entertainment content, everything was primarily a one-way street.

438
00:24:07,491 --> 00:24:12,654
A studio made a game, shipped it off to GameStop, and then they got started on the next one.

439
00:24:12,654 --> 00:24:17,237
But with the introduction of PCs like the Commodore 64 and Apple II, and don't forget

440
00:24:17,237 --> 00:24:20,099
BASIC, all of a sudden people like you and me...

441
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:24,692
Okay, people like me because I'm old, we had the opportunity to start creating our own

442
00:24:24,692 --> 00:24:27,854
totally radical video games.

443
00:24:27,854 --> 00:24:32,396
But and on top of that, PCs saw the introduction of something called the Internet.

444
00:24:32,396 --> 00:24:37,239
This let people from around the world who had common interests like video games connect

445
00:24:37,239 --> 00:24:37,680
with others.

446
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:42,423
Not only could people talk about games together, but then they could also start making games

447
00:24:42,423 --> 00:24:45,464
together and this ushered in a whole new world of collaboration.

448
00:24:46,405 --> 00:24:50,526
But like I mentioned before, video games were pretty much status quo when it came to how

449
00:24:50,526 --> 00:24:52,586
they were created and shared with the world.

450
00:24:52,586 --> 00:24:53,226
Really just one way.

451
00:24:53,226 --> 00:24:58,188
Bulletin boards and then eventually forums gave players the ability to create and share

452
00:24:58,188 --> 00:25:00,768
their thoughts, scores, secrets, and exploits.

453
00:25:00,768 --> 00:25:05,769
It wasn't until the concept of games as a service though, with both subscription based

454
00:25:05,769 --> 00:25:09,970
and free to play games, that we saw the relationship between player and developer become really

455
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:11,811
dynamic and kind of dramatic.

456
00:25:11,811 --> 00:25:12,851
Can you say SWAT?

457
00:25:12,851 --> 00:25:12,891
No.

458
00:25:12,891 --> 00:25:13,271
I don't think so.

459
00:25:15,984 --> 00:25:19,428
Today's player developer relationship really isn't anything new though.

460
00:25:19,428 --> 00:25:24,575
To see where its roots came from we have to take a look back at the concept of art patronage.

461
00:25:24,575 --> 00:25:28,581
How this worked was a really wealthy benefactor would pay an up and coming artist or like

462
00:25:28,581 --> 00:25:30,984
a great master to do nothing but create art.

463
00:25:30,984 --> 00:25:32,566
How fucking cool is that?

464
00:25:33,368 --> 00:25:38,629
Am I saying you're the next Leonardo da Vinci or Michelangelo? Probably not. But you could be

465
00:25:38,629 --> 00:25:42,670
the face of whatever project you're working on, especially if you are part of a small indie

466
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:46,731
team where everybody wears a lot of hats or if you're in a big studio that really pushes for

467
00:25:46,731 --> 00:25:52,113
transparent development with their community. Well, you found yourself in a position to

468
00:25:52,113 --> 00:25:56,294
engage in this dynamic new relationship. What now? Well, first, you need to know your

469
00:25:56,294 --> 00:26:00,355
potential audience. You've got two. Group one, trolls, leave them under the bridge. They

470
00:26:00,355 --> 00:26:02,475
just crave attention. Group two,

471
00:26:02,655 --> 00:26:07,519
pretty much everybody else. Well, almost everybody else. A thing to consider about everybody else is

472
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:10,821
some of those folks, they want to tell you what's wrong with your game and that's fine,

473
00:26:10,821 --> 00:26:14,804
but then they want to tell you how to fix it. And unless you read their comments and you're like,

474
00:26:14,804 --> 00:26:19,507
holy crap, you've got to work here now, you can kind of leave their feedback as don't respond to.

475
00:26:20,435 --> 00:26:26,122
Now what? Well, remember, you can always say nothing. Seriously. This is always your first

476
00:26:26,122 --> 00:26:30,547
best option. Anything you say is the verbal equivalent of gas on a fire. I mean, how many

477
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:35,252
times have you seen a developer reply to an email or a forum post only to see it become part

478
00:26:35,252 --> 00:26:36,453
of an article on a website?

479
00:26:37,114 --> 00:26:42,537
If you feel like you absolutely have to respond to someone, first find out if you really are the right person to do it.

480
00:26:42,537 --> 00:26:47,040
Unless you're specifically given the go-ahead, you should never speak on another department's behalf,

481
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,881
like design, art, animation, marketing.

482
00:26:49,881 --> 00:26:53,563
Marketing people will kick your ass if you try to respond on their behalf.

483
00:26:53,563 --> 00:26:55,905
So it turns out that you are the right person.

484
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:58,506
Well, here we go. Remember what I said before, though.

485
00:26:58,506 --> 00:27:00,307
And I can't stress this enough.

486
00:27:00,307 --> 00:27:01,508
You can still say nothing.

487
00:27:01,508 --> 00:27:03,749
It's better to keep your mouth shut and have them think you're an idiot

488
00:27:03,749 --> 00:27:06,671
than to open your mouth and kind of prove you are an idiot.

489
00:27:07,227 --> 00:27:13,275
So, despite my previous suggestions, you're committed to responding. First thing to do,

490
00:27:13,275 --> 00:27:17,680
leave your ego at the door. It isn't about you. Your update or patch screwed up a game

491
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:22,587
that they spent 30 or more hours a week playing. If you take it personally, you've missed the

492
00:27:22,587 --> 00:27:24,850
whole point of why they emailed and you've kind of already lost.

493
00:27:25,404 --> 00:27:29,789
Respond with humility and transparency. If you treat them the same way you would like to be

494
00:27:29,789 --> 00:27:33,934
treated, more often than not, one of two things is going to happen. Either first, they won't

495
00:27:33,934 --> 00:27:38,320
respond at all. This happens more often than you think. Or two, they'll do a complete 180 and be

496
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,523
like, holy shit, I didn't know real people responded to this.

497
00:27:42,262 --> 00:27:46,483
During your exchange, try to find out what actually made them mad, like you nerfed their

498
00:27:46,483 --> 00:27:50,944
favorite character. Outside of trolls, most people are writing because they genuinely love

499
00:27:50,944 --> 00:27:56,345
your game, which is now kind of really their game, too. If you can find that thing, you'll

500
00:27:56,345 --> 00:28:01,166
have common ground. This is an opportunity to have a genuine interaction with them. You can

501
00:28:01,166 --> 00:28:05,506
take someone who once called you a complete dumbass and was probably Googling how to

502
00:28:05,506 --> 00:28:09,447
swap game dev and turn them into a legitimate, like,

503
00:28:10,184 --> 00:28:14,229
outspoken proponent of your studio and your game. But you're not going to make everyone

504
00:28:14,229 --> 00:28:18,615
happy. It just doesn't work that way. And as long as you're humble and transparent and know

505
00:28:18,615 --> 00:28:24,342
when to keep your mouth shut, that's fine. You'll know you're good and you'll be fine when all

506
00:28:24,342 --> 00:28:29,228
of that stuff shows up on Kotaku. And it will. Thank you very much. Have a great GDC.

507
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:45,406
Hi, my name is Gabriela Vera Ojeda and I am a freelance animator and co-director at Dames Making Games,

508
00:28:45,406 --> 00:28:50,151
a non-for-profit based in Toronto that supports women making and playing games,

509
00:28:50,151 --> 00:28:54,395
and I'm here to talk about how important engaging with local communities is.

510
00:28:55,601 --> 00:28:58,683
So reaching out to a local games community can prove helpful

511
00:28:58,683 --> 00:29:01,285
when you're facing times of uncertainty,

512
00:29:01,285 --> 00:29:03,786
whether it's learning more about how the industry works,

513
00:29:03,786 --> 00:29:05,447
wanting to refine skills,

514
00:29:05,447 --> 00:29:08,249
or simply needing support during stressful times.

515
00:29:08,249 --> 00:29:12,251
Communities can be pillars that hold us up.

516
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:13,832
Being a member of a local community

517
00:29:13,832 --> 00:29:15,153
helps keep that community active.

518
00:29:15,881 --> 00:29:19,890
and an active community can continue giving back resources to those who need it,

519
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:23,899
like myself when I first decided to get involved locally in Toronto about two

520
00:29:23,899 --> 00:29:25,342
years ago when I was still in college.

521
00:29:27,725 --> 00:29:30,045
As a student, I stayed inside my college bubble

522
00:29:30,045 --> 00:29:32,546
for a fairly long time, but once I stepped out

523
00:29:32,546 --> 00:29:35,246
of that comfort zone, I found a lot more resources

524
00:29:35,246 --> 00:29:38,267
that I used to improve my art and animation skills.

525
00:29:38,267 --> 00:29:41,888
I wanted to focus on my studies as much as I could

526
00:29:41,888 --> 00:29:45,509
to develop my skills and graduate with a strong portfolio.

527
00:29:45,509 --> 00:29:48,089
In my second year of college, I had gotten exempt

528
00:29:48,089 --> 00:29:51,650
from a couple classes, so I decided to set aside that time

529
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:53,550
to get to know my community better

530
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:55,471
and prepare for post-graduation life.

531
00:29:56,058 --> 00:30:00,440
I signed up to volunteer at events throughout the city while also honing my creative skills.

532
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:06,224
I immediately felt very motivated by the people I met, artists and designers who had been

533
00:30:06,224 --> 00:30:10,166
in games for long, as well as those who were in a similar position as me.

534
00:30:10,166 --> 00:30:14,248
New to the career, new to the community, not quite sure how or where we fit in.

535
00:30:15,623 --> 00:30:18,125
This was quite the change from my original plan.

536
00:30:18,125 --> 00:30:20,366
Go to college, keep my head down, work hard,

537
00:30:20,366 --> 00:30:21,867
graduate, get a job.

538
00:30:21,867 --> 00:30:23,628
I can be very shy at times.

539
00:30:23,628 --> 00:30:25,809
I'm definitely not the loudest voice in the room

540
00:30:25,809 --> 00:30:28,830
and this is my first time meeting most of you,

541
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,811
so avoiding community stuff seemed ideal

542
00:30:30,811 --> 00:30:32,472
if it meant more time to animate.

543
00:30:33,467 --> 00:30:36,829
But I found out that wasn't challenging or fulfilling enough,

544
00:30:36,829 --> 00:30:39,692
and even though I am an introvert at heart,

545
00:30:39,692 --> 00:30:41,753
I was curious to know what I could do to get involved

546
00:30:41,753 --> 00:30:43,975
with something while I was still a student.

547
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:45,977
Getting out there and lending a hand at these events

548
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:48,839
showed me their importance in how it builds community.

549
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:50,220
During this process of volunteering

550
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,521
and trying community stuff out,

551
00:30:51,521 --> 00:30:53,923
I was also looking to find a particular space

552
00:30:53,923 --> 00:30:55,304
and community I could be a part of,

553
00:30:55,304 --> 00:30:57,526
then sticking to one that felt right,

554
00:30:57,526 --> 00:31:00,268
which is how I ended up joining Dames Making Games.

555
00:31:01,634 --> 00:31:03,897
Even though at times balancing community involvement

556
00:31:03,897 --> 00:31:06,601
and college were difficult, it was worth it.

557
00:31:06,601 --> 00:31:08,823
College helped me develop skills.

558
00:31:08,823 --> 00:31:11,026
Getting involved with my community helped me

559
00:31:11,026 --> 00:31:13,710
sharpen skills I would need to give back to my community,

560
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:17,294
like not being scared of speaking from strangers.

561
00:31:18,144 --> 00:31:22,867
And as a Latina immigrant, my community empowers me and supports my voice,

562
00:31:22,867 --> 00:31:25,289
as well as others who belong to marginalized groups,

563
00:31:25,289 --> 00:31:28,271
giving importance to our stories and experiences.

564
00:31:28,271 --> 00:31:31,253
Amplifying these voices will always bring positive changes.

565
00:31:31,253 --> 00:31:36,877
And both from my personal experiences and in experiences within the community,

566
00:31:36,877 --> 00:31:40,459
supporting marginalized groups makes a community stronger

567
00:31:40,459 --> 00:31:43,441
and creates a healthy and inviting space.

568
00:31:43,441 --> 00:31:45,403
After all, we are stronger together.

569
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:50,691
To reference an example, Dames Making Games focuses

570
00:31:50,691 --> 00:31:52,972
on women, trans, non-binary folk,

571
00:31:52,972 --> 00:31:55,553
working in and playing games, offering events,

572
00:31:55,553 --> 00:31:57,214
workshops, and mentorships.

573
00:31:57,214 --> 00:32:00,295
Most recently, our 15th member game jam, FetFatal5.

574
00:32:00,295 --> 00:32:02,877
It's a priority to have a space

575
00:32:02,877 --> 00:32:05,218
that is both safe and welcoming.

576
00:32:05,218 --> 00:32:09,339
Collaborating with other organizations is also key.

577
00:32:09,339 --> 00:32:12,661
Running workshops aimed at marginalized groups is great,

578
00:32:12,661 --> 00:32:14,301
but it's important to work together

579
00:32:14,301 --> 00:32:15,922
so all communities move forward.

580
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:20,561
and the content is both respectful and benefits those who it is aimed at.

581
00:32:20,561 --> 00:32:26,384
Dames Making Games has been organizing in DigiCade for two years,

582
00:32:26,384 --> 00:32:30,427
a program run in partnership with local Toronto group Indigenous Roots

583
00:32:30,427 --> 00:32:34,469
to offer a long-form program to Indigenous women interested in making games,

584
00:32:34,469 --> 00:32:37,390
providing them with the space, equipment and mentorship to do so.

585
00:32:38,451 --> 00:32:41,675
If members thrive, the community also thrives.

586
00:32:41,675 --> 00:32:48,482
Living the purpose of community in the hands of members gives a chance for everyone to shape community according to its interests and values.

587
00:32:48,482 --> 00:32:50,864
This also ensures members get the support that they need.

588
00:32:50,864 --> 00:32:52,646
I realize that I can be dedicated to both my art and my community.

589
00:32:58,493 --> 00:33:03,376
While I was reluctant at first to get involved with anything relating to community,

590
00:33:03,376 --> 00:33:06,977
I very quickly felt its impact in how I communicated with others

591
00:33:06,977 --> 00:33:09,318
and how I prioritized my time in general.

592
00:33:09,318 --> 00:33:15,241
In conclusion, reaching out locally is important because it's a chance to get involved

593
00:33:15,241 --> 00:33:18,522
in ways that can impact you creatively

594
00:33:18,522 --> 00:33:22,004
and an opportunity to find support among artists and developers in your area.

595
00:33:24,225 --> 00:33:27,027
My personal takeaway is that as a younger artist,

596
00:33:27,027 --> 00:33:29,909
it has inspired my creativity and my passion

597
00:33:29,909 --> 00:33:31,410
for being involved with communities

598
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:32,832
that support marginalized groups,

599
00:33:32,832 --> 00:33:35,053
communities that give us opportunities to grow,

600
00:33:35,053 --> 00:33:35,594
inspiring us to keep going.

601
00:33:35,594 --> 00:33:37,755
And had I dedicated myself only to work and nothing else,

602
00:33:37,755 --> 00:33:38,616
I would have never had a chance to.

603
00:33:48,164 --> 00:33:51,385
have some of these experiences that influence me creatively,

604
00:33:51,385 --> 00:33:55,126
having those very unique connections will never hinder work.

605
00:33:55,126 --> 00:33:57,207
It will only strengthen it even more.

606
00:33:57,207 --> 00:33:57,787
Thank you.

607
00:33:57,787 --> 00:33:58,467
This is working.

608
00:34:05,545 --> 00:34:11,870
There it is. Okay. Good morning. Good morning. Holy shit, there's a lot of you. My name is Gwen,

609
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:15,893
and I'm a technical animator. I've been in the industry for about a decade now.

610
00:34:15,893 --> 00:34:19,175
Most recently, I co-founded a small studio in Boston, and we launched

611
00:34:19,175 --> 00:34:23,939
The Flame in the Flood one year ago today.

612
00:34:23,939 --> 00:34:29,583
We have... We're up for two awards at the IGF.

613
00:34:30,516 --> 00:34:32,819
Yeah, but I'm not here today to talk about that.

614
00:34:32,819 --> 00:34:35,462
The topic today is community, which is fantastic.

615
00:34:35,462 --> 00:34:37,645
I'm really glad we get to talk about this.

616
00:34:37,645 --> 00:34:38,547
Communities are wonderful.

617
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:43,582
There's absolutely no negatives being a part of a community, and I want to go over several

618
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:46,564
of the benefits that there are to being in a community.

619
00:34:46,564 --> 00:34:52,309
The first thing I want to talk about is how beneficial engaging the community is for your

620
00:34:52,309 --> 00:34:53,590
skill as an animator.

621
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:58,134
I remember when I started out as a student, I thought the time I would spend animating

622
00:34:58,134 --> 00:34:59,755
would make me a better animator.

623
00:34:59,755 --> 00:35:03,578
But it turns out the time you spend on social media makes you a better animator.

624
00:35:04,218 --> 00:35:06,440
And so I think I'd like to talk about how to do that.

625
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,001
I think the first thing everyone here should do

626
00:35:08,001 --> 00:35:10,562
is to go on Reddit and find all the subreddits

627
00:35:10,562 --> 00:35:14,244
that have to do with gaming and animation and follow them.

628
00:35:14,244 --> 00:35:16,465
Then I think you should find like several hundred people

629
00:35:16,465 --> 00:35:17,006
to follow on Twitter.

630
00:35:17,006 --> 00:35:19,987
There's Pinterest boards, websites, Tumblr blogs,

631
00:35:19,987 --> 00:35:21,568
there's people Twitch streaming themselves

632
00:35:21,568 --> 00:35:24,830
and there's YouTube videos with tips and tricks and shorts.

633
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:26,651
And you need to look at all these resources

634
00:35:26,651 --> 00:35:29,272
because the reality is resources

635
00:35:29,272 --> 00:35:31,414
are what's gonna make you a better animator.

636
00:35:32,234 --> 00:35:35,696
And every now and then you're gonna find some resources that are truly fantastic,

637
00:35:35,696 --> 00:35:39,338
like no bullshit, Christian's YouTube videos are actually really good.

638
00:35:39,338 --> 00:35:40,799
Like, they're fantastic.

639
00:35:40,799 --> 00:35:43,620
And they might inspire you, like if you watch his videos,

640
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:47,162
you might be inspired to make better animations,

641
00:35:47,162 --> 00:35:48,843
or something better might happen.

642
00:35:48,843 --> 00:35:49,783
You might be inspired.

643
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:52,427
to make your own YouTube videos.

644
00:35:52,427 --> 00:35:54,710
And this is great, because if you're doing this,

645
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:57,333
then you're engaging the community directly.

646
00:35:57,333 --> 00:36:00,818
I mean, you're engaging the community as a YouTuber

647
00:36:00,818 --> 00:36:03,982
rather than as an animator, but that's what you want.

648
00:36:03,982 --> 00:36:05,164
Because in reality.

649
00:36:05,745 --> 00:36:11,791
It's the likes you get on your videos and the number of views and the content you make

650
00:36:11,791 --> 00:36:15,555
that's not animation that really determines your skill as an animator.

651
00:36:15,555 --> 00:36:19,099
You'll know you're making it when you're making Twitter polls and podcasts.

652
00:36:19,099 --> 00:36:20,000
And I can hear you.

653
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,721
I know what you're thinking.

654
00:36:20,721 --> 00:36:22,543
You're like, but Gwen, I want to animate.

655
00:36:22,543 --> 00:36:23,384
I want to be an animator.

656
00:36:23,384 --> 00:36:24,425
Shouldn't I be animating?

657
00:36:24,425 --> 00:36:25,045
No.

658
00:36:25,045 --> 00:36:27,348
That's the wrong idea.

659
00:36:28,844 --> 00:36:30,186
It's talking about animation.

660
00:36:30,186 --> 00:36:31,808
It's thinking about animation.

661
00:36:31,808 --> 00:36:33,311
It's reading about it.

662
00:36:33,311 --> 00:36:34,453
That's what makes you a better animator,

663
00:36:34,453 --> 00:36:36,456
and the community will help you get there.

664
00:36:36,456 --> 00:36:39,060
There's other benefits to being in a community as well.

665
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,624
For instance, the collaborative problem-solving

666
00:36:41,624 --> 00:36:43,828
we do as a community is really beneficial.

667
00:36:44,128 --> 00:36:47,473
When you're looking through all these YouTube videos, you're going to realize

668
00:36:47,473 --> 00:36:51,678
that we've already got a lot of these things figured out. Like if I want to animate a

669
00:36:51,678 --> 00:36:56,205
character landing, I know exactly how a character should land. It's been drilled into my head.

670
00:36:56,205 --> 00:37:00,290
I've seen it over and over. And I think that's fantastic.

671
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:03,053
Because we troubleshoot these problems together,

672
00:37:03,053 --> 00:37:06,237
we save so much time and energy as developers.

673
00:37:06,237 --> 00:37:08,559
And honestly, I think the best case scenario

674
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,902
is when we all come together as an industry

675
00:37:10,902 --> 00:37:14,025
and we turn game development into a collaborative experience.

676
00:37:14,025 --> 00:37:15,567
You have to understand, I'm an Indian,

677
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:17,469
even when I was in AAA, like the hardest part

678
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:19,051
about making a game is pre-production.

679
00:37:19,051 --> 00:37:21,814
Figuring out exactly what it is you should be making.

680
00:37:23,015 --> 00:37:29,660
You have all these goals and like you want to eat and you just can't figure out what to do and it's very stressful.

681
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:34,363
But fortunately last year we came together as an industry and we realized

682
00:37:34,363 --> 00:37:39,027
we just need to make a character-based shooter with MOBA elements.

683
00:37:39,027 --> 00:37:42,610
And it's really comforting when your livelihood comes from your art to know that we

684
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:45,572
have all come to this conclusion because that means it's probably right.

685
00:37:47,714 --> 00:37:48,494
Oh, God, I forgot.

686
00:37:48,494 --> 00:37:49,835
The best part about being in a community

687
00:37:49,835 --> 00:37:51,816
is, of course, the feedback you get.

688
00:37:51,816 --> 00:37:53,537
And I don't just mean the animation community,

689
00:37:53,537 --> 00:37:55,258
though the animation community

690
00:37:55,258 --> 00:37:56,238
and the game development community

691
00:37:56,238 --> 00:37:57,499
will give you great feedback,

692
00:37:57,499 --> 00:37:59,740
but the gaming community, man, they go above and beyond.

693
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,701
Like, they're great at reaching out

694
00:38:01,701 --> 00:38:03,061
and letting you know what they think.

695
00:38:03,061 --> 00:38:04,042
They'll find you.

696
00:38:04,042 --> 00:38:06,423
They'll write you emails, they'll write you reviews,

697
00:38:06,423 --> 00:38:07,864
they'll find you on Twitter,

698
00:38:07,864 --> 00:38:09,964
they'll find you on LinkedIn, that's weird.

699
00:38:10,687 --> 00:38:15,032
oh, here's a fun thing, they can, so when somebody on Steam decides they want to return

700
00:38:15,032 --> 00:38:19,136
your game and they want a refund, they can write you a little note to let you know why.

701
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:25,063
Like here's some of the things people have written us. The letter T. Character so ugly

702
00:38:25,063 --> 00:38:28,967
I shat my pants. Wow, we had an impact there.

703
00:38:32,262 --> 00:38:35,044
And some people get a little stressed out by this.

704
00:38:35,044 --> 00:38:38,206
I know it seems like when people give you these reviews,

705
00:38:38,206 --> 00:38:40,627
what they say they want, and actual metrics,

706
00:38:40,627 --> 00:38:42,388
and purchasing data don't align at all.

707
00:38:42,388 --> 00:38:45,230
But that's the community doing you a favor, really.

708
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:47,812
And I think the best case study for this is Warframe.

709
00:38:47,812 --> 00:38:49,152
Warframe is a game that,

710
00:38:49,152 --> 00:38:50,873
one of the highest grossing games on Steam last year.

711
00:38:50,873 --> 00:38:51,814
It did super well.

712
00:38:51,814 --> 00:38:53,835
And the reviews are quite negative.

713
00:38:53,835 --> 00:38:57,217
But the gamers put so much time.

714
00:38:57,577 --> 00:39:00,118
and energy into reviewing that game.

715
00:39:00,118 --> 00:39:01,399
They really did the research,

716
00:39:01,399 --> 00:39:04,160
and I think that's why Warframe is such a good game, really.

717
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,660
And I think the devs appreciate that.

718
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,221
And so in conclusion,

719
00:39:07,221 --> 00:39:09,762
I hope you've learned three things from this talk.

720
00:39:09,762 --> 00:39:11,363
I hope you know that you should research

721
00:39:11,363 --> 00:39:12,803
as much as possible.

722
00:39:12,803 --> 00:39:13,764
Use social media for this.

723
00:39:13,764 --> 00:39:14,964
I think you should know

724
00:39:14,964 --> 00:39:16,745
that you don't need to reinvent the wheel.

725
00:39:16,745 --> 00:39:18,265
The community has made the perfect wheel.

726
00:39:18,265 --> 00:39:18,966
Use the wheel.

727
00:39:18,966 --> 00:39:20,666
And I think you should immerse yourself

728
00:39:20,666 --> 00:39:22,707
in the feedback directly from your gamers.

729
00:39:23,608 --> 00:39:26,969
I hope you're a part of all these communities and I hope you go ahead and follow me.

730
00:39:26,969 --> 00:39:30,550
If you'd like to be part of my community, I'm daragoldfish on Twitter.

731
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:33,711
I have a podcast called the Dialog Box on iTunes and obviously I have a YouTube account

732
00:39:33,711 --> 00:39:34,911
with tips and tricks videos.

733
00:39:34,911 --> 00:39:35,611
Check them out.

734
00:39:35,611 --> 00:39:36,771
Have a wonderful conference.

735
00:39:36,771 --> 00:39:37,251
Here you go.

736
00:39:37,251 --> 00:39:37,852
Thank you.

737
00:39:37,852 --> 00:39:38,292
Thank you.

738
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:38,632
Thank you.

739
00:39:38,632 --> 00:39:48,854
Thank you.

740
00:39:48,854 --> 00:39:49,214
Thank you.

741
00:39:49,214 --> 00:39:49,494
Thank you.

742
00:39:49,494 --> 00:39:49,754
Thank you.

743
00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:49,954
Thank you.

744
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:50,174
Thank you.

745
00:39:50,174 --> 00:39:50,394
Thank you.

746
00:39:50,394 --> 00:39:50,855
Thank you.

747
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:51,235
Thank you.

748
00:39:51,235 --> 00:39:51,595
Thank you.

749
00:39:55,444 --> 00:40:03,317
it's making sounds. Okay, there we go. My talks, I guess how I figured out how to be part of a

750
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:06,441
community, it took me a long time. So here we go.

751
00:40:08,223 --> 00:40:13,947
All right. Hi, I'm Matt Majors, a loner, a rebel. I attended Cal Arts to become an animator

752
00:40:13,947 --> 00:40:17,750
nearly 20 years ago. It worked and now I am. I've worked at a few places, Rhythm and

753
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:22,554
Hughes and Weta, and now for the last 14 years I've worked at Pixar. I love working at

754
00:40:22,554 --> 00:40:25,416
Pixar now, but there was a time I didn't and I couldn't figure out why.

755
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:31,824
I spent my first 10 to 15 years both in and out of school so obsessively focused on being

756
00:40:31,824 --> 00:40:36,988
a great Pixar animator that I neglected nearly everything else. I was finally part of a community

757
00:40:36,988 --> 00:40:41,452
that I had wanted to be part of so badly but I wasn't feeling a part of it. By the end

758
00:40:41,452 --> 00:40:45,815
of my 10th professional year, I was burnt out, tired of animation, tired of the wonderful

759
00:40:45,815 --> 00:40:50,059
community I was so fortunate to be part of, tired of not understanding what my voice was

760
00:40:50,059 --> 00:40:55,063
in the art I was making. If I'm going to make something, oh, jeez.

761
00:40:57,645 --> 00:41:06,269
Where are we going here? Slide burnt out. There we go. All right. Sorry. Yeah. You wouldn't

762
00:41:06,269 --> 00:41:11,831
realize that I work on computers all day every day. All right. So anyway, if I'm going to make

763
00:41:11,831 --> 00:41:15,813
something, it damn well better be good. Otherwise it's not worth the effort. I love to

764
00:41:15,813 --> 00:41:19,595
improve and I love to see the before and after difference. The question was, how do I

765
00:41:19,595 --> 00:41:23,756
improve if I feel like I'm done? So I started asking what next? Am I going to be a park

766
00:41:23,756 --> 00:41:24,196
ranger?

767
00:41:25,834 --> 00:41:30,698
I knew I'd invested more time and effort into this than anything else in my life, even skateboarding,

768
00:41:30,698 --> 00:41:33,460
and I spent way too much time doing that.

769
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:36,422
So there must be something I love about animation, I just needed to find it.

770
00:41:36,422 --> 00:41:38,824
I needed to make something different of my own.

771
00:41:38,824 --> 00:41:41,666
I love games, so I decided to try developing one.

772
00:41:42,628 --> 00:41:47,715
Imagine you're all deeply aware of this. Developing games is really damn hard. But it was

773
00:41:47,715 --> 00:41:52,161
great. I was talking to a lot of new people who had different talents. I was using my

774
00:41:52,161 --> 00:41:56,106
animation sensibilities and design skills to answer questions I hadn't asked let alone

775
00:41:56,106 --> 00:41:56,747
answered before.

776
00:41:57,386 --> 00:42:01,753
I iterated the ever-loving hell out of that game, a full 23 versions of three completely

777
00:42:01,753 --> 00:42:04,276
different mechanics over the course of five months.

778
00:42:04,276 --> 00:42:08,282
As it started to wrap up, I didn't really feel I had anything viable, but I learned

779
00:42:08,282 --> 00:42:12,028
a lot and established ties to a new community and was realizing that maybe animation was

780
00:42:12,028 --> 00:42:12,549
in my future.

781
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:17,241
Meanwhile at Pixar, I got lucky and landed a spot on the Inside Out team.

782
00:42:17,241 --> 00:42:22,024
I decided to take four months and focus on nothing more than animating and getting to

783
00:42:22,024 --> 00:42:24,906
know more people with the intensity I'd use to pursue my game.

784
00:42:24,906 --> 00:42:28,489
That way I could really answer the question, do I want to be an animator?

785
00:42:29,574 --> 00:42:34,079
I focused on making every bit of animation the absolute best I could. I struggled to

786
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:37,703
find the same truth in my work as I had in my game. I ate lunch with different people

787
00:42:37,703 --> 00:42:43,930
every day because I enjoyed meeting new people while working on my game. I communicated as

788
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:47,975
clearly and concisely as I could about every aspect of my job. My take away from those

789
00:42:47,975 --> 00:42:50,557
four months, animation is fucking amazing.

790
00:42:51,438 --> 00:42:56,141
Finding the truth in your work is the best way to enjoy it. Interacting with a variety of

791
00:42:56,141 --> 00:43:00,444
people is great. Critical thinking and problem solving are everything. But I still felt I

792
00:43:00,444 --> 00:43:06,929
didn't necessarily understand my voice. I love to cook. I do it every day on weekends. I go

793
00:43:06,929 --> 00:43:11,852
nuts. It's physical. It's mine. The sear on a piece of meat. My call. Ingredients I use. My

794
00:43:11,852 --> 00:43:16,755
choice. However, cooking for yourself isn't really that much fun. I'm feeding people. Their

795
00:43:16,755 --> 00:43:18,637
reaction matters. It's communication.

796
00:43:19,537 --> 00:43:21,998
I love riding skateboards too.

797
00:43:21,998 --> 00:43:23,819
Ramp or street skating today, up to me.

798
00:43:23,819 --> 00:43:26,280
Throw myself off this massive flight of stairs

799
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,121
if I really want to.

800
00:43:27,121 --> 00:43:28,801
However, I like to skate with friends.

801
00:43:28,801 --> 00:43:30,822
I like to be part of a community.

802
00:43:30,822 --> 00:43:32,663
For some reason, I've never asked myself this,

803
00:43:32,663 --> 00:43:34,084
but one day I realized,

804
00:43:34,084 --> 00:43:35,604
how do I know when and what to do

805
00:43:35,604 --> 00:43:37,585
in these other pursuits that I love?

806
00:43:37,585 --> 00:43:38,285
It's what I like.

807
00:43:38,285 --> 00:43:39,026
That's how I know.

808
00:43:39,026 --> 00:43:40,786
How do you think it should be done?

809
00:43:40,786 --> 00:43:42,287
That's the most important question.

810
00:43:42,287 --> 00:43:45,108
That's what sets your work apart from everyone else's.

811
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:50,154
Before becoming burnt out, I worked in a vacuum of my own making. I was so focused on

812
00:43:50,154 --> 00:43:54,659
trying to be great, I was ignoring everything else, including myself. You can't become great

813
00:43:54,659 --> 00:43:58,643
by trying to be great. You can, however, find the truth in your work, that thing that gets

814
00:43:58,643 --> 00:44:02,207
you excited, and use that to make your work the best it can be. Whether you thought it was

815
00:44:02,207 --> 00:44:03,448
great or not is not up to you.

816
00:44:04,289 --> 00:44:09,873
The only thing you've got is yourself. Your mind, your thoughts, your actions. It's a weird

817
00:44:09,873 --> 00:44:13,635
message for a talk on community, I know, but it's true. If you're approaching your job, your

818
00:44:13,635 --> 00:44:17,398
friends, your communities from a point of view other than your own, you're not giving much and

819
00:44:17,398 --> 00:44:22,961
you're getting even less. So it's your decision. However, when you're working on someone

820
00:44:22,961 --> 00:44:27,805
else's project, that work is only yours to a point. How the hell do you deal with that? Well,

821
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,442
Your first pass is everything.

822
00:44:30,442 --> 00:44:32,224
This is your moment to make your work

823
00:44:32,224 --> 00:44:33,485
what you think it's supposed to be.

824
00:44:33,485 --> 00:44:35,968
Do that, make damn sure it's clear,

825
00:44:35,968 --> 00:44:39,051
it communicates your ideas about both physics and feelings

826
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:41,414
and fits well with the work around it.

827
00:44:41,414 --> 00:44:43,196
By doing this, when you get direction,

828
00:44:43,196 --> 00:44:44,157
you'll know where you've been

829
00:44:44,157 --> 00:44:45,458
and it makes it that much easier

830
00:44:45,458 --> 00:44:47,360
to talk about where the work needs to go.

831
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:52,286
you have a point of reference. If not, you'll be chasing someone else's ideas through a void. So

832
00:44:52,286 --> 00:44:56,351
get the hell out of your rut. Learn something new. Maybe it's about animation, maybe it's

833
00:44:56,351 --> 00:45:00,676
about architecture. Just do and learn other things. You'll gain new knowledge and you'll

834
00:45:00,676 --> 00:45:05,121
gain the ability to observe what you do through a new lens. This will help you understand what

835
00:45:05,121 --> 00:45:06,723
you want out of your work more.

836
00:45:07,304 --> 00:45:10,205
Once you understand what you like and where you're coming from, interacting with your

837
00:45:10,205 --> 00:45:13,868
community will be a hell of a lot easier because you'll have your point of view as a starting

838
00:45:13,868 --> 00:45:19,371
place. You'll be a point of reference instead of part of a mob. So I love cooking,

839
00:45:19,371 --> 00:45:23,774
skateboarding, developing games, animating and I love the community of Pixar. All those

840
00:45:23,774 --> 00:45:27,957
things I thought I was doing by myself as a loner, a rebel, I was doing them with and for

841
00:45:27,957 --> 00:45:32,220
people. I finally understand what I need out of it and what I need to give and I finally

842
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:35,542
understand how to be part of the community. Anyway, thanks everybody.

843
00:45:45,915 --> 00:45:48,375
Hi, I'm Tim Borelli, Animation Director,

844
00:45:48,375 --> 00:45:50,456
wow, that's a good start, at First Strike Games,

845
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:54,256
and Lana asked me to share a personal story

846
00:45:54,256 --> 00:45:57,537
about GDC last year, and so I hope I don't fuck this up.

847
00:45:57,537 --> 00:46:00,298
Every year, like many of you here,

848
00:46:00,298 --> 00:46:04,079
I look forward to GDC, and specifically this boot camp.

849
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:08,199
Last year was no different, except for one minor difference.

850
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:09,780
And if I could write a letter to myself

851
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:13,140
about any one thing that day, it would be this.

852
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:15,221
You suck, and that's okay.

853
00:46:16,283 --> 00:46:17,605
Hey, past him.

854
00:46:17,605 --> 00:46:19,106
Right now, you're probably on the phone

855
00:46:19,106 --> 00:46:20,787
talking to your boss.

856
00:46:20,787 --> 00:46:23,489
You'd been enduring repeated texts from work all morning.

857
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:25,571
The bootcamp is more important than work,

858
00:46:25,571 --> 00:46:27,513
you thought to yourself.

859
00:46:27,513 --> 00:46:29,274
But what you didn't realize, though,

860
00:46:29,274 --> 00:46:32,116
was that those texts were mostly from your team.

861
00:46:32,116 --> 00:46:34,358
They were telling you that they had just been laid off

862
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:35,960
and want to know what the hell just happened.

863
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:39,763
So there you are, listening to the voice on the other line,

864
00:46:39,763 --> 00:46:42,525
about to find yourself in the same boat as them,

865
00:46:42,525 --> 00:46:45,107
laid off over the phone with no warning.

866
00:46:45,544 --> 00:46:50,887
and no severance. Soon you'll get a ton of texts asking what happened and realize that

867
00:46:50,887 --> 00:46:55,150
you should probably call your wife before she finds out through Facebook. Her only reaction

868
00:46:55,150 --> 00:46:59,873
will be to say, I just got my knives sharpened. Can I go to your office and pick up your stuff?

869
00:46:59,873 --> 00:47:05,177
It'll be a good reminder of why you married her. After getting off the phone, you'll keep

870
00:47:05,177 --> 00:47:09,019
it to yourself and bury yourself in the talks of the day. You'll even keep live tweeting

871
00:47:09,019 --> 00:47:12,822
for the folks who are not there. That's what this community means to you. It's stronger

872
00:47:12,822 --> 00:47:13,823
than any layoff.

873
00:47:14,714 --> 00:47:20,595
That said, the layoff will still affect you, but you won't see it coming. You'll freak out a

874
00:47:20,595 --> 00:47:25,056
lot, crying in your room more than once, as it's the first layoff you've ever experienced.

875
00:47:25,056 --> 00:47:29,537
You'll even run the animation roundtables and think, you did a pretty good job. When you

876
00:47:29,537 --> 00:47:33,858
get the reviews in a few weeks, Tim, this will be your first sign. You'll also learn that

877
00:47:33,858 --> 00:47:39,840
getting laid off during GDC isn't the worst thing that could happen. The people around you

878
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:44,181
will put you in touch with recruiters and friends and friends of friends looking to help.

879
00:47:44,977 --> 00:47:49,722
you'll make new connections and rekindle some old ones

880
00:47:49,722 --> 00:47:52,224
and try your best to help others do the same.

881
00:47:52,224 --> 00:47:53,826
Once home, you'll start sending out your reel

882
00:47:53,826 --> 00:47:56,088
to the places you spoke with during GDC.

883
00:47:56,088 --> 00:47:57,629
You'll be fine, you say, you're not a dick

884
00:47:57,629 --> 00:47:59,491
and your reel is pretty good, right?

885
00:47:59,491 --> 00:48:01,133
But it's been two days and all you'll think is,

886
00:48:01,133 --> 00:48:04,776
why aren't they knocking down my door yet?

887
00:48:04,776 --> 00:48:06,818
At this point, you will not yet realize that you suck,

888
00:48:06,818 --> 00:48:07,599
but that's okay.

889
00:48:08,282 --> 00:48:12,123
as soon you'll start getting extra work requests. You'll be asked to take a test and say, sure,

890
00:48:12,123 --> 00:48:15,343
I'll do a two-minute cinematic sequence with two characters acting and interacting and it's due

891
00:48:15,343 --> 00:48:20,805
in two weeks. Fucking A, I need a job. You'll also be asked about tech art roles, something you

892
00:48:20,805 --> 00:48:26,906
hadn't done in years. And Tim, as much as you like posting Instagram videos of yourself all the

893
00:48:26,906 --> 00:48:31,207
fucking time, talking about your pythons is the last thing you'll want to do.

894
00:48:32,467 --> 00:48:36,710
you'll have lunches with studio heads to see what you're looking for and that'll make you

895
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:42,555
realize that you have absolutely no clue. The people you are with right now will reach out to

896
00:48:42,555 --> 00:48:47,939
help often. One will give you an amazing critique of your reel and you'll tell them next year

897
00:48:47,939 --> 00:48:50,321
you see that you felt like you let them down.

898
00:48:51,009 --> 00:48:55,410
Like, you let a lot of people down because your reel wasn't as good as he and others

899
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:56,611
had hoped it would be.

900
00:48:56,611 --> 00:48:57,611
But don't worry, though.

901
00:48:57,611 --> 00:49:01,772
Eventually that will light a fire in you, but not before you finally realize that you

902
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:01,992
suck.

903
00:49:01,992 --> 00:49:06,993
You suck at wanting to look for a new job, at even trying to find a new job.

904
00:49:06,993 --> 00:49:11,514
You'll find yourself caring more about helping old co-workers land on their feet than you

905
00:49:11,514 --> 00:49:11,934
on your own.

906
00:49:11,934 --> 00:49:17,556
And soon, Tim, you'll get depressed and you'll start drinking a lot.

907
00:49:18,813 --> 00:49:23,875
too much to the point where you'll get sick and you'll need to stop for a while. You'll step

908
00:49:23,875 --> 00:49:27,677
away and start concentrating on yourself and your family. You'll do other things like

909
00:49:27,677 --> 00:49:32,220
photography and lifting and helping your wife and it will work. Through your wife's

910
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:36,562
company you'll talk to game devs almost daily and remember that feeling of community that you

911
00:49:36,562 --> 00:49:40,364
had at GDC when this all started. You'll spend time outside of that lifting shit and

912
00:49:40,364 --> 00:49:42,405
hanging out with your dog, picking up his shit.

913
00:49:43,048 --> 00:49:46,709
Importantly, you'll start to care again and one night you'll decide that you're going to animate

914
00:49:46,709 --> 00:49:51,350
one thing every day and post it on Twitter. Your blockings and breakdowns will be absolute shit at

915
00:49:51,350 --> 00:49:56,291
first, but keep at it. You'll get feedback from this community and be motivated by everyone's

916
00:49:56,291 --> 00:50:01,093
encouragement. You'll still suck, but at least now you'll know it. And Tim, you won't believe it,

917
00:50:01,093 --> 00:50:04,573
but not long after you'll get a message from Mike Bithell. He's been following the hashtag and will

918
00:50:04,573 --> 00:50:09,254
ask you to join his next project. Just wait until you see the concepts. It's a boy and his dog.

919
00:50:09,254 --> 00:50:12,615
You're a boy with a dog. So yeah, you'll say, let's animate some fucking dogs.

920
00:50:13,555 --> 00:50:15,637
You'll give him your rate and he'll take it right away.

921
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:19,419
You should probably learn how to negotiate that shit better.

922
00:50:19,419 --> 00:50:20,860
You'll pick up more work like that

923
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:22,461
and realize that freelance isn't something

924
00:50:22,461 --> 00:50:24,322
that everyone should do before working in a studio,

925
00:50:24,322 --> 00:50:26,464
that learning how to divorce your emotion from your work

926
00:50:26,464 --> 00:50:28,425
can only help you in a team environment.

927
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:32,268
And you'll tell them during next year's GDC.

928
00:50:32,268 --> 00:50:34,349
Your old team will drag you to coffee weekly.

929
00:50:34,349 --> 00:50:36,050
Brad Clark will help with tech art problems

930
00:50:36,050 --> 00:50:38,752
and you'll learn to value those relationships more.

931
00:50:38,752 --> 00:50:40,313
Through all of this, you'll watch others

932
00:50:40,313 --> 00:50:41,274
going through layoffs and...

933
00:50:42,162 --> 00:50:43,503
Tim, make sure you do what you can to help.

934
00:50:43,503 --> 00:50:46,045
Reach out, because you'll remember what it was like

935
00:50:46,045 --> 00:50:46,946
to be where they are.

936
00:50:46,946 --> 00:50:49,288
And while freelancing will be great,

937
00:50:49,288 --> 00:50:51,990
you'll miss the daily interaction with teammates.

938
00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:53,712
Soon you'll be approached to join a new company

939
00:50:53,712 --> 00:50:55,794
with an incredible team who reminds you of everything

940
00:50:55,794 --> 00:50:58,416
that you love about making games, and you'll take the leap.

941
00:50:58,416 --> 00:51:00,898
It won't be perfect, and you won't expect it to be,

942
00:51:00,898 --> 00:51:02,860
but it won't suck, and that's okay.

943
00:51:04,332 --> 00:51:08,335
P.S. Tim, next year, make sure to let everybody know that this letter wasn't just for you,

944
00:51:08,335 --> 00:51:09,135
but it was for them.

945
00:51:09,135 --> 00:51:14,139
Any one of them could find themselves feeling like they suck at work, at life, at giving

946
00:51:14,139 --> 00:51:14,419
GDC talks.

947
00:51:14,419 --> 00:51:18,862
Tell them that, yes, things might suck now, but the community that we build up around

948
00:51:18,862 --> 00:51:20,763
ourselves will be there to make sure that it's okay.

949
00:51:20,763 --> 00:51:21,123
Thank you.

950
00:51:21,123 --> 00:51:21,303
Thank you.

951
00:51:21,303 --> 00:51:21,484
Thank you.

952
00:51:21,484 --> 00:51:21,824
Thank you.

953
00:51:21,824 --> 00:51:22,144
Thank you.

954
00:51:22,144 --> 00:51:22,304
Thank you.

955
00:51:22,304 --> 00:51:22,524
Thank you.

956
00:51:22,524 --> 00:51:22,684
Thank you.

957
00:51:22,684 --> 00:51:22,884
Thank you.

958
00:51:22,884 --> 00:51:23,085
Thank you.

959
00:51:23,085 --> 00:51:27,708
Thank you.

960
00:51:27,708 --> 00:51:27,868
Thank you.

961
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:36,881
Thank you, Tim.

962
00:51:36,881 --> 00:51:38,843
All right, so like I said, my name is Shabazz Shah.

963
00:51:38,843 --> 00:51:40,784
I'm a senior animator at Telltale Games.

964
00:51:40,784 --> 00:51:43,366
Now, if you've played Telltale's games,

965
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:46,227
you're familiar with the story-driven gameplay

966
00:51:46,227 --> 00:51:48,829
where you, the player, are given a choice

967
00:51:48,829 --> 00:51:52,151
to interact with an event that's taking place on the screen

968
00:51:52,151 --> 00:51:54,553
or to interact with another character in the game.

969
00:51:54,553 --> 00:51:56,514
Now, what's so compelling about this gameplay

970
00:51:56,514 --> 00:52:00,177
is that we make those choices in our lives every day,

971
00:52:00,177 --> 00:52:02,038
and every day is a new opportunity

972
00:52:02,038 --> 00:52:04,399
to choose how you interact with others.

973
00:52:05,305 --> 00:52:08,987
Now I had an old animation supervisor, and maybe he'll end up hearing this, Jeff Shue,

974
00:52:08,987 --> 00:52:13,090
he brought the animators together before a production one time, and I'm going to paraphrase

975
00:52:13,090 --> 00:52:15,592
here but he said something pretty awesome.

976
00:52:15,592 --> 00:52:20,836
He said to us, he said that this job wasn't about you or your demo reel.

977
00:52:20,836 --> 00:52:26,680
And that what this production was about was working towards creating the best possible

978
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:29,041
product that we could together.

979
00:52:29,875 --> 00:52:34,798
Now what I thought was so great about this was it was a reminder that when we put our

980
00:52:34,798 --> 00:52:41,101
work first, we focus only on our work, we put our egos before everything else, we fail

981
00:52:41,101 --> 00:52:45,204
to create these collaborative communities within our teams and within our companies.

982
00:52:45,754 --> 00:52:51,938
What we end up doing is we forget that everybody around us equally has an opportunity to affect

983
00:52:51,938 --> 00:52:53,599
our careers or our lives in some way.

984
00:52:53,599 --> 00:53:01,523
What we end up failing to see is that everybody around us has a valuable lesson to teach the

985
00:53:01,523 --> 00:53:05,345
company and that everybody around us can teach us something.

986
00:53:09,531 --> 00:53:14,197
You're going to work with people from amazing studios,

987
00:53:14,197 --> 00:53:16,941
from across the country, from all walks of life,

988
00:53:16,941 --> 00:53:17,802
and from even across the world.

989
00:53:17,802 --> 00:53:20,166
And you yourself are going to be one of those professionals.

990
00:53:20,166 --> 00:53:21,427
Now, this experience is invaluable.

991
00:53:28,503 --> 00:53:30,865
And what we can do is we can find these opportunities

992
00:53:30,865 --> 00:53:34,448
to share this experience and to share that knowledge.

993
00:53:34,448 --> 00:53:36,710
So here are some ideas on what we can do

994
00:53:36,710 --> 00:53:39,713
to build collaborative communities within our teams

995
00:53:39,713 --> 00:53:40,434
and within our companies.

996
00:53:40,434 --> 00:53:42,476
Doing animation demonstrations,

997
00:53:42,476 --> 00:53:44,578
where a new member of the team gets up

998
00:53:44,578 --> 00:53:47,641
and presents a lecture on a workflow or a tool.

999
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:50,764
We can have after-hour type animation challenges

1000
00:53:50,764 --> 00:53:52,525
for animators to work on their craft,

1001
00:53:52,525 --> 00:53:54,727
as well as provide feedback to each other.

1002
00:53:55,508 --> 00:53:59,230
even doing social, more kind of casual meetups and events

1003
00:53:59,230 --> 00:54:01,450
where animators can get to know each other,

1004
00:54:01,450 --> 00:54:05,472
and even allowing time for animators to get involved in R&D

1005
00:54:05,472 --> 00:54:08,634
so they can collaborate with other departments as well.

1006
00:54:08,634 --> 00:54:12,075
It's important to remember to be inclusive and proactive

1007
00:54:12,075 --> 00:54:14,396
in this company, in your company,

1008
00:54:14,396 --> 00:54:17,738
and also within your industry.

1009
00:54:17,738 --> 00:54:21,299
And working collaboratively means

1010
00:54:21,299 --> 00:54:23,180
getting out of your chair, unfortunately.

1011
00:54:24,068 --> 00:54:25,708
Sorry, that's the sad part about it.

1012
00:54:25,708 --> 00:54:27,088
But what we wanna do is I'll let you decide

1013
00:54:27,088 --> 00:54:29,449
who the beauty is and who the beast is,

1014
00:54:29,449 --> 00:54:31,209
but it's important to remember that we need

1015
00:54:31,209 --> 00:54:35,050
to develop relationships outside of our departments as well.

1016
00:54:35,050 --> 00:54:37,950
Start collaborating with TDs and effects artists

1017
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:40,591
and programmers and designers and producers.

1018
00:54:40,591 --> 00:54:44,331
These collaborations greatly increase

1019
00:54:44,331 --> 00:54:45,651
the value of our final products.

1020
00:54:45,651 --> 00:54:49,392
And it means not relying, as I mentioned,

1021
00:54:49,392 --> 00:54:51,412
on chat and email and getting out of your chair

1022
00:54:51,412 --> 00:54:53,013
and starting those conversations.

1023
00:54:53,869 --> 00:54:55,830
and creating those opportunities.

1024
00:54:55,830 --> 00:54:59,791
Attending company events, getting to know your coworkers,

1025
00:54:59,791 --> 00:55:04,453
and remembering to always behave in a professional manner,

1026
00:55:04,453 --> 00:55:06,213
of course.

1027
00:55:06,213 --> 00:55:10,255
Now the thing is that experience, it can't be taught.

1028
00:55:10,255 --> 00:55:14,156
And the connections that we make in this room,

1029
00:55:14,156 --> 00:55:16,657
in events like this within your company,

1030
00:55:16,657 --> 00:55:18,298
the collaborations that we create

1031
00:55:18,298 --> 00:55:22,619
are just as important as working on your specific skill

1032
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:23,320
for your career.

1033
00:55:26,249 --> 00:55:32,192
Now Stephen King once said that we never know which lives we will influence or when or why.

1034
00:55:32,192 --> 00:55:36,754
And I think that this is so true, especially when it comes to our coworkers.

1035
00:55:36,754 --> 00:55:45,597
Bill Nye once said that everyone you will ever meet knows something that you don't.

1036
00:55:45,597 --> 00:55:51,780
And it's a great reminder to keep a humble attitude in our careers as we recognize that

1037
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:55,682
everybody around us has something that we can learn from.

1038
00:55:56,833 --> 00:56:02,776
So to close, I just want to tell you guys that we're all in this together.

1039
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:07,779
And that the collaborations, creating these collaborative communities within our teams

1040
00:56:07,779 --> 00:56:13,201
and within our companies helps us push this industry and continue to make it great.

1041
00:56:13,201 --> 00:56:19,885
It allows us to have these fun, exciting jobs, but it also helps us build lifelong relationships.

1042
00:56:19,885 --> 00:56:20,845
Thank you.
