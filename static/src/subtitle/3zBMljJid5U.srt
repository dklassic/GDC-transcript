1
00:00:11,594 --> 00:00:13,075
John's much taller than me.

2
00:00:13,295 --> 00:00:14,916
So I think that's better.

3
00:00:14,956 --> 00:00:15,556
Can everyone hear me?

4
00:00:15,576 --> 00:00:15,776
Great.

5
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:18,297
We're going to go fast, because there's probably

6
00:00:18,317 --> 00:00:19,738
going to be a lot of Q&A here.

7
00:00:20,838 --> 00:00:23,620
If anything doesn't make sense, save it for Q&A.

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,500
And please fill out the reviews afterwards.

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,541
It means a great deal.

10
00:00:26,561 --> 00:00:27,962
Turn your phones off if I hear it.

11
00:00:28,042 --> 00:00:29,702
I'm going to single you out and shame you.

12
00:00:31,223 --> 00:00:33,865
John said Games as a Service isn't dead, and he's wrong.

13
00:00:34,265 --> 00:00:37,447
For the vast majority of you in the audience,

14
00:00:37,567 --> 00:00:38,548
oh, it's definitely dead.

15
00:00:39,088 --> 00:00:42,670
Like 90%, 95% of you, it's totally dead.

16
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,192
So we'll talk about how to adapt to that reality.

17
00:00:46,352 --> 00:00:47,633
Before we start, I'm Mike.

18
00:00:48,133 --> 00:00:49,534
I'm the CEO of Iron Horse Games.

19
00:00:49,794 --> 00:00:51,876
We're a publisher, and by we, I mean me,

20
00:00:52,596 --> 00:00:55,118
my infant son, and my darling, devoted wife.

21
00:00:56,118 --> 00:01:01,582
We've generated 1.2 million installs across seven titles since December.

22
00:01:01,942 --> 00:01:05,924
Most of our titles, with one exception, are in open beta, and I'm going to be talking

23
00:01:05,944 --> 00:01:06,905
about that a lot today.

24
00:01:07,605 --> 00:01:08,706
We have one title that's launched.

25
00:01:08,746 --> 00:01:10,087
You can find it right now in Google Play.

26
00:01:10,127 --> 00:01:11,648
It's being featured in Idle Sword 2.

27
00:01:11,908 --> 00:01:12,468
It's awesome.

28
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:17,552
We started publishing games in December, so we've done a lot of organic traffic in a short

29
00:01:17,592 --> 00:01:20,173
amount of time, and I'm going to try and do my best to explain how we've done that.

30
00:01:21,389 --> 00:01:22,810
Well, the title got your attention.

31
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:23,711
That's why you're all here.

32
00:01:23,971 --> 00:01:25,453
Games as a Service is dead if you're

33
00:01:25,493 --> 00:01:27,574
trying to do Games as a Service once you're live.

34
00:01:28,295 --> 00:01:29,676
You can still apply the methodology

35
00:01:29,716 --> 00:01:30,837
with some tweaks that I'm going to give you.

36
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:32,739
You just have to do it before you globally launch.

37
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,162
This presentation is largely about how

38
00:01:36,182 --> 00:01:38,103
to maximize installs in open beta

39
00:01:38,984 --> 00:01:41,086
and what metrics to focus on once you get

40
00:01:41,126 --> 00:01:42,187
those installs into your game.

41
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:48,954
First, for those who don't know, Games as a Service is basically the operation of the title once it's out,

42
00:01:49,934 --> 00:01:54,317
with the goal of improving your retention and monetization metrics.

43
00:01:55,298 --> 00:01:58,680
Usually there's some weaknesses around those that folks try and shore up once they're out.

44
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,641
The ideal situation that you're trying to achieve with Games as a Service

45
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:05,424
is you're making enough money from the title to support the team that's working on it,

46
00:02:05,544 --> 00:02:06,904
and also to afford marketing.

47
00:02:06,924 --> 00:02:10,126
There's probably a handful of you guys in here who are in that position,

48
00:02:10,226 --> 00:02:12,148
but the vast majority of game developers are not.

49
00:02:13,364 --> 00:02:16,727
Concept was first introduced in the heady days of MySpace

50
00:02:16,767 --> 00:02:18,609
and Facebook, and also Pogo, which

51
00:02:18,809 --> 00:02:20,811
I'm not going to talk about that much, because that was actually

52
00:02:20,851 --> 00:02:21,632
before my time.

53
00:02:22,793 --> 00:02:24,435
These are social web-based platforms

54
00:02:24,455 --> 00:02:25,776
that were defined by virality.

55
00:02:26,417 --> 00:02:28,899
If you weren't there, oh, that was awesome.

56
00:02:29,259 --> 00:02:32,282
Like, you could just hoist a game up on Facebook,

57
00:02:32,362 --> 00:02:37,407
and boom, 14 to 15 million active users in the first month.

58
00:02:38,427 --> 00:02:41,047
for nothing, no feature, no marketing spend,

59
00:02:41,087 --> 00:02:43,348
you were just getting traffic like crazy doing nothing.

60
00:02:44,668 --> 00:02:47,129
The best games on the platform, the ones that were at the top

61
00:02:47,169 --> 00:02:50,109
in terms of DAU were about 20 to 30 million daily active users,

62
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:51,310
one to five on Myspace.

63
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,790
There was strong retention driven by casual titles,

64
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,891
so everyone remembers those notifications

65
00:02:56,911 --> 00:02:57,891
that your crops are withering.

66
00:02:58,051 --> 00:03:00,072
Those had a twofold purpose.

67
00:03:00,132 --> 00:03:02,152
The first, obviously, was to get you to.

68
00:03:02,972 --> 00:03:06,974
tell your friends to come help and unweather your crops and drove k-factor on the games.

69
00:03:07,034 --> 00:03:11,317
But the second one, which is really important, people forget all the time, is it is a reminder

70
00:03:11,737 --> 00:03:15,399
to come back and play the game. If you have any games on Facebook Instant Games,

71
00:03:15,939 --> 00:03:21,622
you should be abusing the notifications. That is the whole purpose of those notifications,

72
00:03:21,682 --> 00:03:22,803
get people back into the game.

73
00:03:23,688 --> 00:03:25,609
Anyway, that's a separate talk altogether.

74
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,650
So why do the games thrive there?

75
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:31,632
Well, teams were operating games with massive DAUs.

76
00:03:31,672 --> 00:03:34,613
You're talking 1 million, 5 million daily active users

77
00:03:34,653 --> 00:03:35,393
for large games.

78
00:03:35,873 --> 00:03:38,014
Small changes in your metrics can

79
00:03:38,054 --> 00:03:40,795
mean big changes in your daily revenue numbers.

80
00:03:41,576 --> 00:03:43,756
Marketing, again, was a factor, but it was a small one.

81
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:46,970
Why is it different on mobile?

82
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,532
So raise your hand if you just hoisted a game up

83
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:52,393
on iOS or Android and got 12 to 13 million installs,

84
00:03:52,714 --> 00:03:54,915
and then everyone in this room is going to attack you.

85
00:03:56,876 --> 00:03:57,937
That's right, it doesn't happen.

86
00:03:58,797 --> 00:04:00,999
There's a much heavier reliance on user acquisition

87
00:04:01,059 --> 00:04:03,500
outside of the gates if you don't get platform support

88
00:04:04,241 --> 00:04:06,702
and or you don't have a massive marketing budget kind

89
00:04:06,723 --> 00:04:07,543
of dead in the water.

90
00:04:08,464 --> 00:04:09,965
The crazy thing about it, and the reason

91
00:04:09,985 --> 00:04:11,145
I wrote this talk in the first place,

92
00:04:11,245 --> 00:04:14,267
is that games as a service as a concept is the same.

93
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:17,348
So we've changed platforms entirely.

94
00:04:17,888 --> 00:04:21,849
The presence of massive users coming into your game for free

95
00:04:22,189 --> 00:04:22,770
doesn't exist.

96
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,310
But we still operate games the same way

97
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,311
we did back on Facebook and MySpace, with the same

98
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:28,271
assumptions that are built in.

99
00:04:28,411 --> 00:04:30,171
This has to be adjusted for mobile.

100
00:04:31,172 --> 00:04:32,332
Before we do that, we're going to talk

101
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:33,952
about what mobile conditions look like now.

102
00:04:34,212 --> 00:04:38,633
Last July, I published a game called Idle Empires

103
00:04:39,454 --> 00:04:40,854
on iOS and Google Play.

104
00:04:41,793 --> 00:04:45,276
We're going to look at pre- and post-install numbers here around the launch.

105
00:04:45,757 --> 00:04:49,400
This first bump is us going out on open beta, so we've got some pretty good users there.

106
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,721
Second bump is us getting featured.

107
00:04:51,741 --> 00:04:54,063
The third bump is sadness.

108
00:04:54,344 --> 00:04:56,165
It's just a plateau of nothing.

109
00:04:58,637 --> 00:05:01,838
Apple looks the same, but with less users.

110
00:05:01,858 --> 00:05:03,158
We got one big bump from features.

111
00:05:03,619 --> 00:05:05,219
Don't get me wrong, getting featured is awesome

112
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:06,020
on both platforms.

113
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,621
Without it, I don't think many of our businesses would exist.

114
00:05:09,721 --> 00:05:11,742
But it is a zero-sum game.

115
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:15,083
So this is what our money looked like

116
00:05:16,264 --> 00:05:17,564
on Google Play and Apple as well.

117
00:05:17,644 --> 00:05:19,805
So basically, if you get installs, you're making money.

118
00:05:19,825 --> 00:05:21,346
If you don't get installs, you're not making money.

119
00:05:21,366 --> 00:05:21,986
It's simple as that.

120
00:05:22,996 --> 00:05:24,557
So what does that mean for games as a service?

121
00:05:24,918 --> 00:05:27,400
Well, it means you get most of your installs

122
00:05:27,721 --> 00:05:30,403
and most of your money early, and I mean real early,

123
00:05:30,683 --> 00:05:33,306
first couple weeks, first month of the game being launched.

124
00:05:33,987 --> 00:05:35,608
What's not being shown on those charts

125
00:05:36,489 --> 00:05:38,952
is the fact that your early cohorts are your most valuable.

126
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:42,055
So folks think that, oh, there's just an endless amount

127
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:43,917
of users who are interested in my game out there

128
00:05:43,957 --> 00:05:44,837
and I just need to find them.

129
00:05:44,857 --> 00:05:45,518
That's not true.

130
00:05:46,119 --> 00:05:46,879
It's not true at all.

131
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,441
Like, there is a finite number of users

132
00:05:49,742 --> 00:05:50,722
that are into your game.

133
00:05:51,283 --> 00:05:52,944
And the further that you get away from them,

134
00:05:52,964 --> 00:05:54,405
the less valuable they get.

135
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:55,827
They're just not into you.

136
00:05:57,288 --> 00:05:59,890
Re-features, I know a lot of folks in here are like,

137
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:02,012
oh, well, I'm gonna get a re-feature, so screw you, Mike.

138
00:06:02,032 --> 00:06:03,193
I'm much smarter than you.

139
00:06:03,433 --> 00:06:04,634
Well, joke's on you.

140
00:06:04,654 --> 00:06:07,316
That's 7% to 10% of the initial installs

141
00:06:07,336 --> 00:06:08,517
you saw from your first feature.

142
00:06:08,977 --> 00:06:09,258
Nothing.

143
00:06:09,278 --> 00:06:12,020
I mean, it's really a small amount of installs.

144
00:06:14,382 --> 00:06:19,672
you need to be in a position where you're applying games as a service before you get

145
00:06:19,752 --> 00:06:23,779
live to capture the maximum value for the maximum value from users that you're going

146
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:26,724
to get. So there's a silver lining.

147
00:06:28,747 --> 00:06:33,231
we're actually in the best time ever in terms of tools

148
00:06:33,591 --> 00:06:35,893
and access to potential users in open beta.

149
00:06:36,453 --> 00:06:40,256
So I've been doing publishing, I don't know, six years,

150
00:06:40,356 --> 00:06:40,976
something like that.

151
00:06:41,457 --> 00:06:43,939
I've been in free to play for a bit longer than that.

152
00:06:44,940 --> 00:07:07,763
and having access to these users is kind of it's a it's a it's a great opportunity right now and it's better than it's ever been. Google Play open beta is a great source and kind of the only source for these users that exist on mobile today. If you'll take a look at any of my games that are out right now in Google Play, they're all in open beta. And there's a reason for that. It's because I know how to get installs there.

153
00:07:07,964 --> 00:07:11,007
I'm going to tell you how to get installs there and what to do with them to prepare

154
00:07:11,627 --> 00:07:15,551
for your inevitable launch and all the money that you're going to make, or some small subset

155
00:07:15,571 --> 00:07:15,952
of you will.

156
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:17,734
So, why Open Beta?

157
00:07:17,974 --> 00:07:20,036
Folks who don't know, Open Beta is a state...

158
00:07:21,005 --> 00:07:23,085
that you can put your game into on Google Play.

159
00:07:24,246 --> 00:07:26,747
When you're in open beta, you can designate the game

160
00:07:26,787 --> 00:07:29,067
to be available to anyone, anywhere that

161
00:07:29,087 --> 00:07:30,208
has the link to download it.

162
00:07:30,628 --> 00:07:31,568
What a lot of people don't know is

163
00:07:31,608 --> 00:07:34,449
you can still rank in keywords when you're in open beta, which

164
00:07:34,509 --> 00:07:35,149
is awesome.

165
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:38,350
You can still rank in, for instance, in IdleSort 2,

166
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:38,810
we rank.

167
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:45,752
I think one or two in incremental RPG, and we've done so for almost the entire duration that we were in open beta.

168
00:07:46,373 --> 00:07:51,194
You still get listed in store listings, so this is something that a lot of folks don't know either.

169
00:07:51,334 --> 00:07:55,715
You can still be listed in games that are recommended for you, games you might like,

170
00:07:56,155 --> 00:07:56,956
simulation games.

171
00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:02,157
The benefits are you don't have ratings, so your game doesn't get a rating,

172
00:08:02,877 --> 00:08:06,298
which is actually good because you're gonna be changing the game quite a bit in the early days,

173
00:08:06,859 --> 00:08:08,379
and you don't want to be saddled with a low

174
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:10,962
low rating as a result of those changes,

175
00:08:11,183 --> 00:08:13,025
users being upset with you for all those changes.

176
00:08:13,766 --> 00:08:15,088
And finally, you don't have a chart position,

177
00:08:15,108 --> 00:08:16,050
which sounds bad, but wait,

178
00:08:16,691 --> 00:08:19,134
there's something on Google Play called New Free Games.

179
00:08:19,254 --> 00:08:20,256
If you don't know what it is,

180
00:08:20,276 --> 00:08:22,799
it's a special chart that exists on Google.

181
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:24,910
It doesn't exist on iOS.

182
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:29,534
You are there for 30 days once you're released globally

183
00:08:30,455 --> 00:08:31,496
in a specific geo.

184
00:08:31,816 --> 00:08:34,519
So if I were to release today in the US,

185
00:08:34,859 --> 00:08:36,380
I'd be on this chart for 30 days.

186
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,903
Your position on the chart is determined

187
00:08:38,943 --> 00:08:41,745
by the velocity and volume of installs that you get.

188
00:08:42,226 --> 00:08:44,207
You do not, I repeat, you do not want

189
00:08:44,227 --> 00:08:45,929
to be on this chart if your game is not

190
00:08:46,009 --> 00:08:48,031
ready to maximize the value that you're

191
00:08:48,051 --> 00:08:49,372
going to get from the installs on this chart.

192
00:08:50,979 --> 00:08:55,484
So the chart on the left is what it looks like when your game is

193
00:08:55,644 --> 00:08:59,068
found, found, quote unquote, by Google. So one to two weeks

194
00:08:59,148 --> 00:09:01,690
after you open up into open beta, Google will find your

195
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:04,653
game and start putting it into category lists. And those are

196
00:09:04,673 --> 00:09:06,675
the lists I was talking about before. And I'll detail that

197
00:09:06,715 --> 00:09:10,179
further. So you have two weeks, two weeks to prepare for these

198
00:09:10,239 --> 00:09:11,881
installs. The question is, what do you do?

199
00:09:12,702 --> 00:09:17,086
You should prep for the algorithm to the best of your ability by improving page conversion rates,

200
00:09:17,946 --> 00:09:23,551
optimizing your ASO. So I'm going to go through these in detail, but essentially you're looking

201
00:09:23,611 --> 00:09:29,517
at optimizing the store art for your icon, you're localizing your store page descriptions,

202
00:09:30,057 --> 00:09:34,161
screenshots, A-B testing screenshots, and working on your preview. And there's a bunch of kind of

203
00:09:34,301 --> 00:09:38,365
tricks and catches here, and I've done my best to detail them all as we go forward.

204
00:09:39,105 --> 00:09:44,469
So for those who don't know, store conversion rate is how effectively your page on the left,

205
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:49,551
on my left, you can see Idle Sword 2, that's our sword, it converts users at a rate of 15%,

206
00:09:50,432 --> 00:09:56,595
which is okay. I've seen numbers that are much higher. On more casual games, you can look at 40,

207
00:09:56,816 --> 00:10:03,079
50, 60% for your conversion rate, and on much more hardcore games, which with a limited audience,

208
00:10:03,119 --> 00:10:03,960
that can be as low as 5 to 6%.

209
00:10:06,714 --> 00:10:09,135
So icon tests are the first and most important thing

210
00:10:09,155 --> 00:10:10,015
that you can do on your game.

211
00:10:10,535 --> 00:10:12,036
You need to test big variations here.

212
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:15,937
So for instance, the skull that's showing on the icons,

213
00:10:15,977 --> 00:10:17,277
if you tested those against each other,

214
00:10:17,397 --> 00:10:19,098
you're really not going to get too much statistical

215
00:10:19,138 --> 00:10:19,658
significance.

216
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:21,559
Between the two, they're almost identical.

217
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:24,159
You need to test big variations that

218
00:10:24,179 --> 00:10:26,360
are representative of what your game is about.

219
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,761
If you think about it, if you're misrepresenting your game

220
00:10:28,801 --> 00:10:29,481
through the icon.

221
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:32,444
people clicking on the icon are going to hit your landing page,

222
00:10:32,925 --> 00:10:33,485
and the jigs up.

223
00:10:33,525 --> 00:10:35,307
They're going to find out what kind of game you've got.

224
00:10:35,748 --> 00:10:38,131
So you're just going to suffer in terms of conversion rate.

225
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:39,793
So don't lie.

226
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:41,214
Tell them what the game is about.

227
00:10:41,755 --> 00:10:43,497
Put forth some interesting marketing art

228
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:44,198
for them to look at.

229
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:45,739
We run A-B tests.

230
00:10:46,801 --> 00:10:51,124
on our icons and yielded a 24% increase in our installs as a result.

231
00:10:51,424 --> 00:10:55,967
This is no joke. It's real installs. It's a relatively minor change that you can do.

232
00:10:56,348 --> 00:11:01,371
It's cheap from an art perspective. You need to rotate these every two to four weeks. If

233
00:11:01,391 --> 00:11:04,454
you're aggressive, you should be doing it every one to two weeks. The way you should think about it.

234
00:11:05,174 --> 00:11:07,315
A lot of you are probably too young for this,

235
00:11:07,355 --> 00:11:08,476
but there are department stores,

236
00:11:08,496 --> 00:11:10,157
and department stores have display windows,

237
00:11:10,297 --> 00:11:11,697
like Macy's or Bloomingdale's.

238
00:11:12,158 --> 00:11:13,818
When you walk by them, they put attractive,

239
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:15,739
interesting setups in their store window

240
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:16,740
to get you to come in.

241
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,441
And even if they create the most amazing,

242
00:11:19,561 --> 00:11:22,223
alluring store window, it's gonna get old after time.

243
00:11:22,623 --> 00:11:24,684
It is them marketing to you to come into the store.

244
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:26,345
Your store is the same thing.

245
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:27,845
It is a marketing asset.

246
00:11:28,165 --> 00:11:30,407
Even if you're not spending a dollar in user acquisition,

247
00:11:30,447 --> 00:11:32,928
you're still marketing as far as your store is concerned.

248
00:11:34,214 --> 00:11:36,537
And last but not least, retest your old icons.

249
00:11:37,017 --> 00:11:39,620
Old icons don't remain old icons for long.

250
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,602
Just because they didn't perform in the past

251
00:11:41,642 --> 00:11:43,243
doesn't mean that they won't perform in the future.

252
00:11:43,264 --> 00:11:44,064
So rotate those in.

253
00:11:45,463 --> 00:11:47,684
So your feature graphic, this is another important one.

254
00:11:47,865 --> 00:11:51,466
So we've run tests and seen a 10% increase in our installs.

255
00:11:52,366 --> 00:11:54,207
If you think about it, it's the first thing you see

256
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:56,568
when you hit the page, is the feature graphic,

257
00:11:56,688 --> 00:11:59,950
which is the background to your preview video and the icon.

258
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:02,251
Those two need to work well together,

259
00:12:02,951 --> 00:12:05,232
but it is also a big marquee image

260
00:12:05,852 --> 00:12:07,173
that you see at the top of your page.

261
00:12:07,353 --> 00:12:09,434
You should rotate this every two to four weeks.

262
00:12:11,052 --> 00:12:11,653
Add a preview.

263
00:12:11,793 --> 00:12:15,718
So we saw a two percentage point lift in our conversion rate

264
00:12:15,838 --> 00:12:17,400
just by adding a preview video.

265
00:12:17,881 --> 00:12:18,962
These aren't that expensive.

266
00:12:19,042 --> 00:12:21,806
It's roughly three to 4K if you don't have an artist on staff

267
00:12:21,846 --> 00:12:22,667
that can do it for you.

268
00:12:23,688 --> 00:12:25,590
You can always talk to a marketing company.

269
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:27,473
I'm sure there's a ton of marketing folks in here

270
00:12:27,553 --> 00:12:28,374
right now kind of.

271
00:12:29,408 --> 00:12:30,568
sneaking down in your chairs,

272
00:12:30,908 --> 00:12:32,349
but they will make one for you.

273
00:12:32,809 --> 00:12:34,329
Literally, they all have these SDKs,

274
00:12:34,349 --> 00:12:36,090
you're all getting emails about it constantly

275
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,170
to integrate their SDKs.

276
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,371
Ask them to make a marketing video for you.

277
00:12:39,691 --> 00:12:41,031
Nine times out of 10, it's gonna be better

278
00:12:41,071 --> 00:12:41,992
than anything you can do,

279
00:12:42,392 --> 00:12:43,712
because they're a marketing company,

280
00:12:43,852 --> 00:12:45,313
and this is a marketing creative.

281
00:12:46,473 --> 00:12:49,174
You can rotate these scenes around for a quick refresh as well.

282
00:12:49,254 --> 00:12:52,736
So basically what you can do is take the last scene and put it first,

283
00:12:53,296 --> 00:12:56,817
and your first scene and put it last, and that is a new video, at least as far as

284
00:12:57,338 --> 00:12:59,619
short attention spans on the platform are concerned.

285
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:01,139
There is a catch.

286
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:05,741
So this is one of the weird peculiarities of the Google Play Store.

287
00:13:06,442 --> 00:13:07,142
So on Google Play...

288
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,371
If you don't have a preview video,

289
00:13:10,531 --> 00:13:11,572
there are sections of the store

290
00:13:11,612 --> 00:13:13,133
where your game will not appear, period.

291
00:13:13,433 --> 00:13:14,073
You'll never get there.

292
00:13:14,913 --> 00:13:16,434
You have to have a preview video

293
00:13:16,514 --> 00:13:18,095
to be in these sections of the store.

294
00:13:18,695 --> 00:13:20,016
So whenever you're running an A-B test

295
00:13:20,036 --> 00:13:21,977
and it looks like, ah, it's kinda like,

296
00:13:23,218 --> 00:13:25,799
we're running this test, it looks like it's about even

297
00:13:25,859 --> 00:13:27,580
between having a video and not having a video,

298
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,260
why would I do it?

299
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,541
You do it because you get this invisible bump

300
00:13:30,722 --> 00:13:33,563
in your impressions that's not reflected in the A-B test,

301
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,303
and that's real.

302
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:37,921
Localize your store descriptions and screenshots.

303
00:13:38,182 --> 00:13:40,585
Again, this one's important, it's cheap,

304
00:13:40,725 --> 00:13:41,466
and it's easy to do.

305
00:13:41,486 --> 00:13:43,348
You don't have to localize your entire game.

306
00:13:43,368 --> 00:13:45,410
It's not a hugely popular sentiment.

307
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,092
You're gonna get some customer service complaints

308
00:13:47,132 --> 00:13:48,294
that you're not gonna be able to read,

309
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:50,797
but the gist of them is like, you tricked me,

310
00:13:51,638 --> 00:13:52,939
but they downloaded the game

311
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,041
and they're probably enjoying it, so.

312
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:58,862
six one way, half dozen the other. You can see a one to two percentage

313
00:13:58,902 --> 00:14:04,626
point lift in your CVR conversion rate per geo for description localization.

314
00:14:05,147 --> 00:14:08,830
Same thing for your screenshots. It's really easy to do, super simple.

315
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:13,673
I use OneSky. I think they're good. They're certainly fast and cheap.

316
00:14:14,674 --> 00:14:18,437
I only speak English, so I guess that they're doing a great job

317
00:14:18,477 --> 00:14:20,358
in terms of translation. I haven't got any complaints.

318
00:14:21,883 --> 00:14:23,044
Oh, one last bit.

319
00:14:23,845 --> 00:14:26,447
Look at the countries where you're getting the most installs

320
00:14:26,487 --> 00:14:27,508
and really only do it there.

321
00:14:27,628 --> 00:14:29,330
It's not worth doing it all over the place.

322
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:30,571
You only want to do it in countries

323
00:14:30,591 --> 00:14:32,032
where you're getting a large amount of impressions

324
00:14:32,092 --> 00:14:32,573
and installs.

325
00:14:33,293 --> 00:14:34,414
A, B, test your screenshots.

326
00:14:34,454 --> 00:14:36,536
So we saw a 5% install gain here.

327
00:14:36,777 --> 00:14:38,378
This is really similar to icons.

328
00:14:39,439 --> 00:14:41,581
Don't misrepresent your game, test big variation.

329
00:14:41,601 --> 00:14:43,263
You should rotate these every couple of months

330
00:14:43,303 --> 00:14:44,664
and retest your old screenshots.

331
00:14:44,804 --> 00:14:46,606
Again, like icons, they don't remain old for long.

332
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,261
This is a really interesting part of the Google Play Store.

333
00:14:51,281 --> 00:14:55,082
So the screenshots, by far, are the things

334
00:14:55,142 --> 00:14:57,383
that matter the least in terms of your creative.

335
00:14:57,843 --> 00:14:59,864
And the reason is, if anyone has an Android phone

336
00:14:59,884 --> 00:15:02,025
and you open it up and you click through to a page,

337
00:15:02,565 --> 00:15:04,606
like you see the feature graphic, you see the preview,

338
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:06,486
you see the short description, the title,

339
00:15:06,586 --> 00:15:08,507
you see what categories are in, you see the icon.

340
00:15:08,767 --> 00:15:10,628
You do not see screenshots.

341
00:15:10,688 --> 00:15:11,808
Those are all below the fold.

342
00:15:12,789 --> 00:15:17,550
So they're less important in terms of the ability to increase installs or conversions.

343
00:15:18,231 --> 00:15:22,132
This is a fun new one that we found out two weeks ago.

344
00:15:22,993 --> 00:15:25,974
So even if your game is in portrait, you should add landscape screenshots.

345
00:15:26,654 --> 00:15:30,415
Sounds controversial, but again, this is one of the tricks of the Google Play Store.

346
00:15:30,756 --> 00:15:34,837
Very similar to what you see with preview videos.

347
00:15:35,257 --> 00:15:39,619
There are sections of the store where you will only be featured if you have landscape screenshots,

348
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:41,020
even if your game is in portrait.

349
00:15:41,864 --> 00:15:42,785
in portrait mode.

350
00:15:44,406 --> 00:15:47,327
We even with that in mind, we saw a 7% increase

351
00:15:47,347 --> 00:15:48,228
in our installs.

352
00:15:48,668 --> 00:15:50,489
We got more impressions from the Google Play Store.

353
00:15:50,629 --> 00:15:51,690
It's super easy to do.

354
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:56,012
You just package one of your portrait screenshots

355
00:15:56,953 --> 00:15:58,053
with some landscape art.

356
00:15:58,373 --> 00:15:58,994
Bob's your uncle.

357
00:15:59,014 --> 00:15:59,434
You're done.

358
00:16:01,015 --> 00:16:01,975
So no time conversion rate.

359
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:03,216
This is the sad part.

360
00:16:03,456 --> 00:16:04,637
These go down constantly.

361
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:08,319
People are bored of you and your game immediately.

362
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,792
Like almost immediately you are no longer cool.

363
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:12,832
Just like that.

364
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:16,933
Your job is to, to the best of your ability,

365
00:16:17,313 --> 00:16:18,433
keep these numbers up.

366
00:16:18,933 --> 00:16:21,014
You wanna get as many installs in as possible

367
00:16:22,174 --> 00:16:23,834
during your open beta period

368
00:16:23,894 --> 00:16:25,535
so that you can improve your metrics

369
00:16:25,835 --> 00:16:28,155
and actually make some money during open beta as well.

370
00:16:28,175 --> 00:16:30,796
The only way to do that is to keep these numbers up.

371
00:16:33,334 --> 00:16:34,175
Metadata matters.

372
00:16:34,316 --> 00:16:36,279
So I've had a couple of conversations

373
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:40,906
with folks who say store description, title, don't matter.

374
00:16:41,827 --> 00:16:42,288
You're wrong.

375
00:16:42,889 --> 00:16:45,613
So on the left, hi, Pani, I'm talking to you.

376
00:16:46,073 --> 00:16:47,095
It's right here in the front row.

377
00:16:48,576 --> 00:16:52,597
On the left is the developer console page that lists all the information about the game.

378
00:16:52,617 --> 00:16:54,518
So it's title, short description, full description.

379
00:16:55,578 --> 00:17:02,020
That, in conjunction with your bundle ID and the update text you use, form the word bank that is used for your keywords.

380
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:09,563
So when people search on the store and your game comes up, it's because they searched a term that's heavily indexed for your game.

381
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:13,424
All those terms come from this page here.

382
00:17:15,005 --> 00:17:17,625
So testing your short description is really important.

383
00:17:17,945 --> 00:17:19,746
5% lift of installs with words.

384
00:17:20,266 --> 00:17:20,886
Super easy.

385
00:17:21,546 --> 00:17:23,587
But like everything else on the Google Play Store,

386
00:17:23,607 --> 00:17:24,227
there's a catch.

387
00:17:25,167 --> 00:17:26,907
So if you're testing this, you not only

388
00:17:26,927 --> 00:17:29,048
want to pick the one that is driving

389
00:17:29,108 --> 00:17:31,388
the most installs for you, you want

390
00:17:31,408 --> 00:17:33,749
to pick the one that also has keywords

391
00:17:33,769 --> 00:17:35,169
that you want to index in.

392
00:17:35,669 --> 00:17:38,870
So you have to dance this careful dance where you're

393
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,811
making sure that you're picking the winner,

394
00:17:40,891 --> 00:17:42,271
but you're also picking a winner that

395
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:44,591
you've indexed strongly in the keywords that you care about.

396
00:17:45,853 --> 00:17:51,480
So, bundle ID, there's a lot of indications that bundle ID is one of the most important

397
00:17:52,601 --> 00:17:54,384
factors in your keyword and metadata.

398
00:17:54,604 --> 00:17:56,887
Like the items in your actual bundle ID.

399
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,181
filter through into searchable terms about your game.

400
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,742
What a lot of people don't know is once you upload your APK

401
00:18:03,762 --> 00:18:05,723
for the first time, that's your bundle ID.

402
00:18:05,983 --> 00:18:06,923
Can't change it after that.

403
00:18:07,363 --> 00:18:07,763
One and done.

404
00:18:08,263 --> 00:18:09,684
So you need to be thoughtful about

405
00:18:09,924 --> 00:18:11,344
what you're naming your bundle ID.

406
00:18:11,504 --> 00:18:14,445
If you look in URLs on the Google Play Store,

407
00:18:14,805 --> 00:18:16,786
you can see people are doing some really cheeky stuff.

408
00:18:16,946 --> 00:18:19,567
So you'll see like Minecraft, Tycoon, Pokemon,

409
00:18:19,687 --> 00:18:20,947
fight, whatever.

410
00:18:22,779 --> 00:18:26,001
Be careful around terms of service with Google Play.

411
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:28,123
I'm not going to go through the terms of service in detail.

412
00:18:28,163 --> 00:18:30,865
Suffice it to say you should read it and know it before you

413
00:18:30,885 --> 00:18:32,326
start messing around with your keywords.

414
00:18:32,766 --> 00:18:34,047
Because if you're found in violation,

415
00:18:34,087 --> 00:18:35,348
your game's going to get taken down.

416
00:18:35,368 --> 00:18:37,289
At the very least, your update's going

417
00:18:37,309 --> 00:18:38,870
to get rejected from the Google Play Store.

418
00:18:39,391 --> 00:18:42,413
So here's the fun part.

419
00:18:42,593 --> 00:18:45,455
When you rank in keywords before the Google Play algorithm kicks

420
00:18:45,515 --> 00:18:46,796
in, you can see an increase in 50,000 installs

421
00:18:46,816 --> 00:18:47,457
over a 30-day period.

422
00:18:50,609 --> 00:18:50,909
Period.

423
00:18:51,309 --> 00:18:51,810
It's awesome.

424
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:54,271
So getting this right, finding keywords

425
00:18:54,731 --> 00:18:56,852
that are not only representative of your game,

426
00:18:57,492 --> 00:19:01,674
but also index high in terms of search traffic, is super key.

427
00:19:02,014 --> 00:19:04,235
And you want to make sure that those are worked in multiple

428
00:19:04,275 --> 00:19:08,296
times to all of your metadata without violating terms

429
00:19:08,336 --> 00:19:09,417
of service on Google Play.

430
00:19:09,457 --> 00:19:10,177
That's really important.

431
00:19:11,471 --> 00:19:13,652
And for the love of God, just get specific.

432
00:19:13,912 --> 00:19:16,332
Like, if you're doing game and free,

433
00:19:16,453 --> 00:19:18,093
and you mentioned those a hundred times,

434
00:19:18,553 --> 00:19:20,274
unless you have like the most generic,

435
00:19:20,454 --> 00:19:22,694
boring game on the planet, it doesn't matter.

436
00:19:22,734 --> 00:19:24,495
You can be first rank on all of those.

437
00:19:24,535 --> 00:19:25,675
Nobody's gonna download your game.

438
00:19:26,635 --> 00:19:28,476
Because it bears no relationship

439
00:19:28,996 --> 00:19:30,517
to what they were searching for in the first place.

440
00:19:30,557 --> 00:19:31,957
When they were searching for game and free,

441
00:19:32,277 --> 00:19:33,738
I can almost guarantee they're not looking

442
00:19:33,758 --> 00:19:35,158
for a hardcore card battle game.

443
00:19:36,018 --> 00:19:36,778
That's not what they want.

444
00:19:38,872 --> 00:19:40,333
So the Google algorithm kicks in.

445
00:19:40,753 --> 00:19:41,714
The moment's at hand.

446
00:19:42,215 --> 00:19:43,116
Let's get some installs.

447
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,979
So on the left is what the Google Play Store page looks

448
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:46,239
like.

449
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,762
There are all these lists that get populated in the store,

450
00:19:49,782 --> 00:19:51,524
and they're populated by your download behavior

451
00:19:51,544 --> 00:19:52,145
and what you're doing.

452
00:19:52,685 --> 00:19:55,388
When your game is added to those lists, one to two weeks

453
00:19:55,948 --> 00:19:59,092
after you release an open beta, you get a buttload of installs.

454
00:19:59,492 --> 00:20:02,115
That's an industry and scientific term.

455
00:20:03,436 --> 00:20:05,096
We're talking thousands more installs a day.

456
00:20:05,156 --> 00:20:08,438
We went from a couple hundred to seven to 10,000 at our peak.

457
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,339
We saw a huge jump in our keyword ranks.

458
00:20:11,399 --> 00:20:13,920
So your keyword ranks are driven by not only volume,

459
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:14,681
but velocity.

460
00:20:15,141 --> 00:20:16,441
So it's really important.

461
00:20:16,701 --> 00:20:18,482
All that metadata stuff we just talked about,

462
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:21,384
that needs to be set up before the algorithm kicks in

463
00:20:21,464 --> 00:20:21,924
for your game.

464
00:20:22,544 --> 00:20:25,245
Because it creates this virtuous feedback loop, right?

465
00:20:25,405 --> 00:20:27,746
So you get all these installs from Google Play.

466
00:20:28,247 --> 00:20:30,047
That pushes you up on keyword ranks.

467
00:20:30,427 --> 00:20:33,289
The keyword ranks and installs drive more installs

468
00:20:33,309 --> 00:20:34,169
from Google Play.

469
00:20:34,189 --> 00:20:37,030
And you get a crazy amount of installs.

470
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,211
It's really great when it happens.

471
00:20:38,491 --> 00:20:39,691
It's disappointing when it doesn't.

472
00:20:40,312 --> 00:20:42,272
You get much faster A-B test completion.

473
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:45,074
So you can A-B test in a day or less.

474
00:20:46,134 --> 00:20:47,154
And it doesn't last forever.

475
00:20:47,294 --> 00:20:48,315
You got 30 days.

476
00:20:48,715 --> 00:20:50,715
So this seems to be the magic number on Google Play

477
00:20:50,755 --> 00:20:51,395
for whatever reason.

478
00:20:51,415 --> 00:20:53,696
You got 30 days from the moment that this happens.

479
00:20:54,236 --> 00:20:56,736
And then the next 30 days are going to be 50% to 75%

480
00:20:57,516 --> 00:20:58,436
less impressions.

481
00:20:58,456 --> 00:21:02,257
So you're getting insults.

482
00:21:02,277 --> 00:21:03,077
What do you focus on?

483
00:21:03,557 --> 00:21:05,318
Average revenue per paying user is,

484
00:21:05,338 --> 00:21:07,078
I'm going to make the argument, the only thing

485
00:21:07,098 --> 00:21:08,478
that you should really have your eyeball on.

486
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:10,299
The reason why.

487
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:11,659
You can change it quickly.

488
00:21:11,939 --> 00:21:13,619
So average revenue per paying user

489
00:21:13,899 --> 00:21:15,660
is fairly straightforward to change.

490
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:19,502
You need to make a, first and foremost,

491
00:21:19,542 --> 00:21:22,063
you need to surface offers that are meaningful

492
00:21:22,183 --> 00:21:23,283
and valuable to users.

493
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:26,044
If you can't be bothered to surface the awesome thing

494
00:21:26,064 --> 00:21:26,964
that you put in the store,

495
00:21:27,304 --> 00:21:28,385
don't bother putting in the store.

496
00:21:28,865 --> 00:21:31,825
Nobody is just gonna stumble into your store and find it.

497
00:21:32,246 --> 00:21:35,106
Put it in an icon that pulses on the main screen

498
00:21:35,146 --> 00:21:36,767
so people know that there's cool stuff to buy.

499
00:21:37,167 --> 00:21:40,628
Let them refuse your offer as opposed to just making sure

500
00:21:40,648 --> 00:21:42,708
that they ignore it by not going to the store.

501
00:21:43,789 --> 00:21:48,294
it's much easier to change than retention. I'm a strong believer that your retention is a reflection

502
00:21:48,334 --> 00:21:53,679
on the genre you chose, the art style that the game is in, and your game design. If you're

503
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:58,965
trying to change any of those three things at this stage of the game, it's too late.

504
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:00,371
Make a new game.

505
00:22:00,751 --> 00:22:02,793
Your time is much better spent making a new game.

506
00:22:03,173 --> 00:22:04,654
I've seen teams go down the rabbit hole

507
00:22:04,714 --> 00:22:05,835
trying to fix retention,

508
00:22:06,296 --> 00:22:07,717
and they never come out the other side.

509
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:10,359
If they do, they have nothing to show for it.

510
00:22:10,659 --> 00:22:11,920
Just wasted time and money.

511
00:22:12,881 --> 00:22:14,342
Conversion rate's largely capped.

512
00:22:14,582 --> 00:22:17,084
I know that some folks in here think that they've got,

513
00:22:17,725 --> 00:22:19,486
it's perfect monetization strategy.

514
00:22:19,966 --> 00:22:22,428
You're totally gonna like plow through,

515
00:22:22,889 --> 00:22:26,271
have a six or 7% conversion rate on a daily basis.

516
00:22:26,732 --> 00:22:27,633
It's not gonna happen.

517
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:30,516
Like your early cohorts, maybe 4 to 6 percent.

518
00:22:31,137 --> 00:22:32,219
And it's great when it happens.

519
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,041
But those numbers always come down.

520
00:22:34,823 --> 00:22:38,047
1 to 3 percent is the range that you're going to see for converting users into spenders.

521
00:22:39,569 --> 00:22:43,515
Average revenue per paying user is the only thing you should be thinking about at this

522
00:22:43,535 --> 00:22:43,715
time.

523
00:22:45,813 --> 00:22:46,414
So what do you do now?

524
00:22:47,014 --> 00:22:48,676
You need to prepare like you've got one shot

525
00:22:48,796 --> 00:22:50,178
in making money, because you really do.

526
00:22:50,739 --> 00:22:51,319
I mean, this is it.

527
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:54,643
You need to set yourself up so that you're getting

528
00:22:54,683 --> 00:22:57,106
as many installs as possible in open beta.

529
00:22:57,507 --> 00:22:59,689
You need to work on your store landing page

530
00:22:59,709 --> 00:23:01,852
to increase those installs before they actually kick in,

531
00:23:01,952 --> 00:23:03,293
and you need to raise your RPUPU.

532
00:23:03,594 --> 00:23:05,576
That is the new games as a service.

533
00:23:06,117 --> 00:23:07,277
And it's the only one that matters.

534
00:23:07,598 --> 00:23:09,179
For the vast majority of people in this room

535
00:23:09,199 --> 00:23:10,539
and the vast majority of games,

536
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,341
you're not gonna have an ARPU

537
00:23:12,841 --> 00:23:15,383
that's gonna allow you to spend unlimited money

538
00:23:15,443 --> 00:23:17,504
on marketing or continue to operate

539
00:23:17,724 --> 00:23:18,865
or afford to operate your game.

540
00:23:18,885 --> 00:23:19,785
It's just not gonna happen.

541
00:23:20,046 --> 00:23:20,466
And that's not,

542
00:23:20,486 --> 00:23:23,107
it has nothing to do with your skills as game developers.

543
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,529
Those are things that could be outside of your control,

544
00:23:25,549 --> 00:23:26,730
like the genre you've chosen.

545
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:28,131
Like an endless runner.

546
00:23:28,691 --> 00:23:32,574
with rare exceptions, and I'm sure I'll hear about those rare exceptions during the Q&A,

547
00:23:32,974 --> 00:23:37,818
but the exception to the rule is not the vast majority of developers. An endless runner is

548
00:23:37,898 --> 00:23:43,302
never, for the vast majority of people, going to be in a position where you can continue to operate

549
00:23:43,343 --> 00:23:48,827
as games as a service. Finally, and this is a really important one, think about yourself from

550
00:23:48,847 --> 00:23:49,687
the Google Play side.

551
00:23:50,754 --> 00:23:52,074
So Google's trying to think, well,

552
00:23:52,115 --> 00:23:53,395
which games are we going to feature this week?

553
00:23:53,715 --> 00:23:56,496
And they look at Steve's game, and they look at Punny's game.

554
00:23:57,196 --> 00:24:00,117
Steve's game, Steve has extensively

555
00:24:00,277 --> 00:24:01,597
used the Google Play tool set.

556
00:24:02,058 --> 00:24:03,418
It's A-B tested like crazy.

557
00:24:03,878 --> 00:24:05,999
He's really optimized his store conversion rate.

558
00:24:06,639 --> 00:24:08,299
Punny didn't do any of that.

559
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,020
Punny just kind of threw a dead body under the Google Play

560
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,881
store, and was like, oh, let's see what happens.

561
00:24:14,112 --> 00:24:14,593
Steve wins.

562
00:24:14,913 --> 00:24:16,915
Steve wins that every time because he's shown effort,

563
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,317
and he's shown that he cares about using the store

564
00:24:19,357 --> 00:24:21,419
in a way that is meaningful to Google

565
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,321
and using the tools that they've built.

566
00:24:23,822 --> 00:24:24,162
That's it.

567
00:24:24,182 --> 00:24:26,905
Thank you.

568
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:27,505
Thank you.

569
00:24:27,605 --> 00:24:27,966
Thank you.

570
00:24:28,106 --> 00:24:28,926
Thank you.

571
00:24:28,946 --> 00:24:29,467
Thank you.

572
00:24:29,487 --> 00:24:30,268
Thank you.

573
00:24:30,288 --> 00:24:30,768
Thank you.

574
00:24:30,808 --> 00:24:31,249
Thank you.

575
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:31,569
Thank you.

576
00:24:31,769 --> 00:24:31,969
Thank you.

577
00:24:32,049 --> 00:24:33,231
Thank you.

578
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:35,933
Does anyone have any questions?

579
00:24:40,822 --> 00:24:42,463
Oh yeah, I won't yell at you.

580
00:24:43,404 --> 00:24:45,865
I may be short with you if it's a bad question though,

581
00:24:45,885 --> 00:24:47,826
because there are such things as bad questions.

582
00:24:47,946 --> 00:24:48,806
I hope you don't have one.

583
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:51,147
We will know soon.

584
00:24:52,148 --> 00:24:52,968
Yeah, we'll know soon.

585
00:24:53,149 --> 00:24:53,449
That's right.

586
00:24:53,709 --> 00:24:54,889
What's up?

587
00:24:54,989 --> 00:24:56,310
First of all, thanks for the talk.

588
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:57,591
Thanks for coming.

589
00:24:57,611 --> 00:24:58,031
Yeah.

590
00:24:58,431 --> 00:24:59,912
Kudos for the clickbait title.

591
00:25:00,032 --> 00:25:00,452
That's awesome.

592
00:25:01,993 --> 00:25:04,654
I think half of the audience here came to prove you wrong.

593
00:25:07,076 --> 00:25:07,396
So what's up?

594
00:25:08,751 --> 00:25:14,994
Um, I mean, it's, what are you really saying is that developers should stop trying, uh,

595
00:25:15,034 --> 00:25:20,937
mobile or? No, um, I'm saying that there's a, there's a finite window to make changes in

596
00:25:20,957 --> 00:25:25,439
your game before it gets live, right? Like you, if you're in a fortunate position to get a

597
00:25:25,479 --> 00:25:29,040
feature, or even if you're not, you're still going to get a nice spike of installs in those

598
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,902
first 30 days when you're out on Google Play or iOS, right? We've all seen it, you

599
00:25:32,922 --> 00:25:35,163
release and your first 30 days are actually pretty good.

600
00:25:36,063 --> 00:25:40,305
Your game needs to be in a position before that happens to extract the maximum value, right?

601
00:25:40,625 --> 00:25:45,087
Like, the operations, the operating your game like a service or a business,

602
00:25:45,607 --> 00:25:50,769
all that's got to happen in test market for you to extract any value at all, right?

603
00:25:50,809 --> 00:25:54,450
If you don't do those things and you wait, you're never going to be in a position to afford

604
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:57,031
to do them once you're done. That's what I'm saying.

605
00:25:57,111 --> 00:26:02,256
I just wanted to add one thing that if you're like, of course, one of the top grossing games,

606
00:26:02,496 --> 00:26:03,237
it's not bad at all.

607
00:26:03,357 --> 00:26:05,339
You can keep doing profitable UA.

608
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:11,545
But I've seen also some small developers finding some niches where while they cannot scale

609
00:26:11,585 --> 00:26:13,407
indefinitely, they can do profitable UA.

610
00:26:13,907 --> 00:26:17,190
So I would advise looking for small niches as well.

611
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:19,772
I think those things are dependent on your capitalization

612
00:26:19,832 --> 00:26:20,372
for marketing.

613
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,133
If you have the funds to market, or if you

614
00:26:22,153 --> 00:26:23,654
can generate the funds from the game,

615
00:26:23,834 --> 00:26:24,755
you should definitely do it.

616
00:26:24,775 --> 00:26:27,736
It requires a pretty specialized skill set.

617
00:26:28,857 --> 00:26:32,939
And as you said, there's a cap to how long they can do it for

618
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:34,460
and how many installs they can acquire.

619
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,681
I mean, it's possible.

620
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:37,042
And there are people in the room who

621
00:26:37,082 --> 00:26:38,342
have those types of games, right?

622
00:26:38,402 --> 00:26:40,504
They've been able to effectively operate them

623
00:26:40,664 --> 00:26:41,584
over a period of time.

624
00:26:41,944 --> 00:26:43,145
But they're the exception of the rule

625
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:43,906
as opposed to the rule.

626
00:26:43,926 --> 00:26:45,467
The vast majority of people aren't in that spot.

627
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:46,631
Thanks.

628
00:26:46,891 --> 00:26:47,492
Sure, no problem.

629
00:26:47,753 --> 00:26:48,374
Good question, brother.

630
00:26:49,375 --> 00:26:49,676
Hey, what's up?

631
00:26:49,996 --> 00:26:51,980
Hey, thanks for the frank talk and actually giving us

632
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:52,300
numbers.

633
00:26:52,521 --> 00:26:52,781
Helpful.

634
00:26:53,182 --> 00:26:53,382
Yeah.

635
00:26:54,243 --> 00:26:56,948
I'm curious if you have any tricks or tips for iOS.

636
00:26:57,669 --> 00:26:57,749
No.

637
00:27:02,212 --> 00:27:02,652
Get lucky.

638
00:27:03,292 --> 00:27:05,354
No, so iOS is tricky, right?

639
00:27:05,734 --> 00:27:07,415
You shouldn't be doing test markets there.

640
00:27:07,475 --> 00:27:09,596
But you have to do user acquisition, really,

641
00:27:09,616 --> 00:27:11,777
to get any scale of users in there.

642
00:27:12,058 --> 00:27:13,699
And it can be expensive.

643
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:15,800
I've recently tried a pre-order.

644
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,802
So if you get featured for a pre-order,

645
00:27:18,982 --> 00:27:21,003
I've seen devs quote like 50,000 to 70,000

646
00:27:21,563 --> 00:27:24,265
pre-registrations for your game, which is pretty rad.

647
00:27:24,725 --> 00:27:27,127
The challenge with a pre-order is you can't do a test market.

648
00:27:27,847 --> 00:27:28,067
So.

649
00:27:29,275 --> 00:27:36,037
hope you don't have any bugs because you're just going to launch blindly on iOS with no

650
00:27:36,097 --> 00:27:41,418
testing with real users. Um iOS is kind of a different animal. Google built out this this

651
00:27:41,478 --> 00:27:45,659
tool set and it's pretty great. iOS is still a great platform. They have really valuable

652
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:50,000
users and a lot of them they just don't have the same sophistication of of testing tools.

653
00:27:51,581 --> 00:27:52,701
Cool. Thanks for your question.

654
00:27:54,683 --> 00:27:58,945
First yeah, all right. Oh sure. I just wanted a tiny bit of clarification

655
00:27:59,005 --> 00:28:01,406
So you said when you launch an open beta?

656
00:28:01,466 --> 00:28:07,309
There was about two weeks before things like index with Google and then you get like a download increase

657
00:28:07,829 --> 00:28:15,172
So that's outside of whatever download increase you would get when you go out of open beta. Yep to launch. That's right. Okay

658
00:28:18,716 --> 00:28:24,759
I was wondering if you were seeing any significant deviations from one market to another.

659
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,680
Like, were there any that particularly stood out for you?

660
00:28:28,381 --> 00:28:30,583
And also, within that-

661
00:28:30,783 --> 00:28:31,443
I don't understand.

662
00:28:31,563 --> 00:28:32,404
Can you ask the question differently?

663
00:28:32,424 --> 00:28:38,387
So, for example, if you choose to, say, launch US only, but then, like, you go, say, launch

664
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:40,508
Japan, or you launch, pick another market, right?

665
00:28:41,388 --> 00:28:45,170
And as you're looking at this data, are you seeing any differences in the drop-off rates

666
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:45,991
and the retention rates?

667
00:28:46,011 --> 00:28:46,211
Because-

668
00:28:46,231 --> 00:28:46,531
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

669
00:28:46,551 --> 00:28:47,052
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

670
00:28:47,072 --> 00:28:47,192
Yeah.

671
00:28:47,212 --> 00:28:47,412
Okay.

672
00:28:47,452 --> 00:28:47,552
Great.

673
00:28:47,572 --> 00:28:47,792
Thank you.

674
00:28:48,572 --> 00:28:59,120
I mean, if anyone's looked at their revenue numbers, Americans are paying the most.

675
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,061
They usually retain...

676
00:29:00,361 --> 00:29:02,163
In terms of total revenue or in terms of...

677
00:29:02,983 --> 00:29:03,163
Both.

678
00:29:03,724 --> 00:29:04,124
In terms of...

679
00:29:04,144 --> 00:29:05,445
I mean, it depends.

680
00:29:05,485 --> 00:29:06,246
If you've localized...

681
00:29:06,506 --> 00:29:10,749
If you have made your game culturally relevant in Korea and Japan and China...

682
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:15,353
There's an argument that you can make that your game is going to really thrive there,

683
00:29:15,413 --> 00:29:17,194
and there's tons of examples of that.

684
00:29:17,654 --> 00:29:21,838
But by and large, most of the games that I work on really resonate with American audiences.

685
00:29:22,658 --> 00:29:26,601
30 to 40% of the installs I get in open beta are from Americans.

686
00:29:28,062 --> 00:29:30,104
50% of the revenue I generate are from Americans.

687
00:29:30,444 --> 00:29:33,807
And that's pretty consistent with what I see on iOS.

688
00:29:34,467 --> 00:29:36,649
On iOS, the exception is China, which has really

689
00:29:36,669 --> 00:29:39,731
come roaring into the picture in the past couple of years,

690
00:29:40,732 --> 00:29:41,873
both for premium games.

691
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:43,374
They're a great market for premium games.

692
00:29:43,434 --> 00:29:44,795
But for the love of God, don't price them

693
00:29:44,855 --> 00:29:46,556
like you would for an American.

694
00:29:47,857 --> 00:29:48,978
There's a currency there.

695
00:29:48,998 --> 00:29:51,340
It buys different things in China.

696
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,662
Just price it accordingly.

697
00:29:55,503 --> 00:29:58,986
But yeah, China and the US make up the bulk of the revenue I see on iOS.

698
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:02,629
Yeah, because the reason I was curious about that is because the games that we've, we've

699
00:30:02,649 --> 00:30:06,492
been building games in Japan for almost 20 years now.

700
00:30:07,894 --> 00:30:12,358
And what we see on the Deltas are significantly higher on the Japan side than the US.

701
00:30:12,658 --> 00:30:17,362
And the apps that I've worked with in the US side tend to flop.

702
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:20,816
Well, let me know if you want to operate and make changes on my game in Japan.

703
00:30:20,876 --> 00:30:21,939
I'd love to talk to you.

704
00:30:22,019 --> 00:30:23,161
I'm happy to chat with you.

705
00:30:23,703 --> 00:30:24,925
That's what we're doing. But cool.

706
00:30:24,965 --> 00:30:27,170
Just give me your card afterwards. Thanks. Awesome.

707
00:30:28,838 --> 00:30:30,299
Hey, thanks for the talk.

708
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:31,819
Really, really good, impressive.

709
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:32,539
Thanks.

710
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:33,820
I have two questions, actually.

711
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:36,180
One of them is going to be part advertising.

712
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,601
Sorry, I have to root for my homeboys.

713
00:30:38,941 --> 00:30:42,782
So what do you actually do for A-B testing?

714
00:30:42,842 --> 00:30:45,262
Is it native Google Play tools, or you

715
00:30:45,282 --> 00:30:46,563
go like third party developers?

716
00:30:46,583 --> 00:30:47,543
Native Google Play tools.

717
00:30:48,023 --> 00:30:50,323
Have you ever tried the guys from the outside?

718
00:30:50,443 --> 00:30:52,504
I do the cheapest thing possible.

719
00:30:53,324 --> 00:30:55,866
because I am small and...

720
00:30:56,026 --> 00:30:58,087
That is great product, down in Belarus.

721
00:30:58,147 --> 00:30:59,228
It's called Splitmetrics.

722
00:30:59,748 --> 00:31:01,549
All of you guys, Splitmetrics.

723
00:31:01,749 --> 00:31:02,490
Yeah, yeah.

724
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:03,850
Really, really good guys.

725
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:04,771
You got to check it out.

726
00:31:04,991 --> 00:31:05,371
Absolutely.

727
00:31:05,511 --> 00:31:07,312
No, but actually, I'm not from these guys.

728
00:31:07,412 --> 00:31:07,733
Oh, yeah.

729
00:31:07,913 --> 00:31:08,673
I am from Belarus.

730
00:31:08,693 --> 00:31:10,174
That's why I'm looking for my homeboys.

731
00:31:10,274 --> 00:31:11,275
All right, cool.

732
00:31:11,295 --> 00:31:11,835
I'm sure it's true.

733
00:31:12,055 --> 00:31:13,696
But second one, actually, is closer.

734
00:31:13,796 --> 00:31:15,337
I come from the e-sports industry.

735
00:31:15,377 --> 00:31:19,039
So perhaps, you know, that the games as a service,

736
00:31:19,059 --> 00:31:21,521
if you add a competitive feature...

737
00:31:22,241 --> 00:31:27,945
No, esports is the worst. Oh my god, you know exactly what I'm talking about. Sorry

738
00:31:27,965 --> 00:31:30,766
We got to wrap this up a holy shit esports is the worst

739
00:31:31,455 --> 00:31:33,517
Can you elaborate a little bit, please?

740
00:31:33,557 --> 00:31:37,159
Yeah, I mean, it's matchmaking based on skill

741
00:31:37,639 --> 00:31:41,441
and all of the monetization that allows you to buy things

742
00:31:41,481 --> 00:31:44,263
that make you stronger in RPGs can't apply

743
00:31:44,283 --> 00:31:46,864
because it breaks skill-based matchmaking.

744
00:31:47,164 --> 00:31:51,287
So instead, you have to sell items that are aesthetically pleasing.

745
00:31:51,647 --> 00:31:54,909
And unless you have a massive user base, which you have to acquire,

746
00:31:55,229 --> 00:31:58,491
because it's just not that popular a genre, you're never going to do it.

747
00:32:01,464 --> 00:32:02,791
Sorry, eSports are the worst.

748
00:32:03,152 --> 00:32:03,976
I'll talk to you outside.
