Hello, I'm Alexis Kennedy.

2
00:00:02,516 --> 00:00:04,436
I've made three games that you might have heard of.

3
00:00:04,696 --> 00:00:07,416
The first is Fallen London, this beige, grindy, free-to-play thing

4
00:00:07,436 --> 00:00:09,497
made on a budget of zero with a core team of two

5
00:00:09,897 --> 00:00:12,297
that's still running 10 years later, has been quite successful.

6
00:00:12,877 --> 00:00:14,018
The second was Sunless Sea,

7
00:00:14,358 --> 00:00:17,338
which is notoriously the world's slowest RPG,

8
00:00:17,758 --> 00:00:20,539
with permadeath, on a boat, core team of three,

9
00:00:20,659 --> 00:00:23,199
tiny budget, a million copies sold.

10
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:27,240
The third is Cultist Simulator, which we launched last May,

11
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,500
hit number one on Steam.

12
00:00:29,272 --> 00:00:34,216
Ridiculous idea, opaque, deliberately hostile, occult solitaire with no tutorial and permadeath.

13
00:00:34,717 --> 00:00:41,523
And all of these games in fact were quite daft ideas that did well, I think, because they were

14
00:00:41,543 --> 00:00:47,748
quite daft ideas. So I want to talk about melding experimental gameplay with commercial success.

15
00:00:47,768 --> 00:00:48,389
Thank you.
