1
00:00:06,343 --> 00:00:09,884
Hi everyone, I'm Andrew Baer and I was the lead UI programmer on Borderlands 3.

2
00:00:10,525 --> 00:00:13,826
I left Gearbox Software at the beginning of the year, but they've graciously allowed me

3
00:00:13,846 --> 00:00:14,766
to still give this talk.

4
00:00:15,427 --> 00:00:19,008
Today I'll be talking about how we approached creating accessibility features, or as we

5
00:00:19,048 --> 00:00:23,110
saw it, any feature that lowers the barrier of entry for our games so more people can

6
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:23,550
enjoy them.

7
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:27,932
Of course this includes things like colorblind settings and subtitles, but it also includes

8
00:00:27,992 --> 00:00:29,252
features like difficulty settings.

9
00:00:30,444 --> 00:00:34,849
These are some of the accessibility features we added to Borderlands 3, and these are the

10
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:36,091
ones I'll be talking about today.

11
00:00:36,792 --> 00:00:40,416
These features weren't chosen randomly, but rather have specific stories I'd like to tell

12
00:00:40,556 --> 00:00:43,500
in order to help you all learn what worked and what didn't for us.

13
00:00:44,321 --> 00:00:47,826
I'll also be weaving in some organizational stories for those of you in leadership or

14
00:00:47,866 --> 00:00:48,446
production roles.

15
00:00:49,332 --> 00:00:52,213
So that's what I'm bringing to the table, but I'm making two assumptions.

16
00:00:52,953 --> 00:00:56,094
First, I'm assuming y'all are devs, which seems like a pretty safe bet.

17
00:00:56,654 --> 00:01:00,996
And secondly, I assume that if you're here, you already know that accessibility is important.

18
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:04,137
If you're a designer, you want a better experience for your players.

19
00:01:04,638 --> 00:01:07,559
If you're a biz dev person, you want to accommodate a larger audience.

20
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:11,180
If you're a producer, you want the best bang for your buck in terms of features.

21
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,841
And if you're a programmer like me,

22
00:01:13,501 --> 00:01:16,402
you just want to work on the really cool feature that everybody's going to use.

23
00:01:17,598 --> 00:01:21,480
Now if you're not convinced why accessibility is important, don't take my word for it.

24
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:27,321
We were successful in Borderlands 3, and this talk is only a case study about that successful

25
00:01:27,381 --> 00:01:28,902
approach for accessibility features.

26
00:01:29,662 --> 00:01:34,744
There are plenty of brilliant people out there who are talking and writing about why accessibility

27
00:01:34,784 --> 00:01:36,504
should be at the forefront of devs' minds.

28
00:01:37,064 --> 00:01:40,265
I strongly encourage just listening to advocates and outlets for a while.

29
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:48,696
These are my favorite sources, and I referenced them heavily or spoke with them when creating features and creating this talk.

30
00:01:49,457 --> 00:01:55,101
Karen Stevens' research at EA is second to none, and Ian Hamilton and Sherry Thompson are wonderful advocates.

31
00:01:55,821 --> 00:02:01,025
Additionally, the AbleGamers charity does incredible work helping gamers, including creating custom control rigs.

32
00:02:01,846 --> 00:02:10,011
And finally, the Can I Play That? organization has fantastic articles in review, including Borderlands 3's perfect mobility score and 7 out of 10 death scores.

33
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,961
Now my team and I are just UI devs, but that's no excuse.

34
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:16,041
Us devs still have to make an effort,

35
00:02:16,461 --> 00:02:17,502
even when we're under the gun,

36
00:02:17,542 --> 00:02:19,622
to create a much anticipated AAA sequel.

37
00:02:20,262 --> 00:02:22,843
This is exactly where we found ourselves on Borderlands 3.

38
00:02:23,483 --> 00:02:24,963
To give you a better idea of what I mean,

39
00:02:25,203 --> 00:02:28,504
our story begins in the way long back forgotten age of 2017.

40
00:02:30,324 --> 00:02:31,485
It was a whole new world

41
00:02:31,565 --> 00:02:33,265
and everybody was relearning the engine,

42
00:02:33,425 --> 00:02:36,646
from code to design to localization to audio.

43
00:02:37,293 --> 00:02:43,935
For UI in particular, we spent a month or so using UE4's UMG and realized it just wasn't a good fit for us.

44
00:02:44,435 --> 00:02:51,077
We had a couple of reasons for this, but the largest was that our UI designers were struggling with the transition from Adobe's tools to UMG,

45
00:02:51,177 --> 00:02:54,058
and we just couldn't do what we needed to in the schedule we were on.

46
00:02:54,598 --> 00:03:00,420
So, on June 1st, 2017, UI went back to the devil we knew, Scaleform.

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,461
This CL was basically our starting pistol for UI.

48
00:03:05,244 --> 00:03:09,729
Over the next two years and one month, which is nine months less time between Borderlands

49
00:03:09,829 --> 00:03:15,956
1 and Borderlands 2, we would build Borderlands 3 UI from the ground up, since all these changes

50
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:20,241
meant we had no starting code or content, unlike when moving from BL1 to BL2.

51
00:03:20,922 --> 00:03:23,064
We basically had a partial style guide and a dream.

52
00:03:25,231 --> 00:03:36,895
We still created over 60 HUD widgets and 33 menus at Gold, and for comparison, Borderlands 1 and Borderlands 2 had about 30 to 40 HUD widgets, depending on how you count, and about a dozen menus.

53
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:45,498
Borderlands 3 had the most complicated skill tree and inventory yet, and we still kept split-screen, 2-player top-bottom, and 4-player co-op.

54
00:03:46,638 --> 00:03:51,480
A few bullet points on a slide doesn't really do it justice, so to pull just a few examples...

55
00:03:52,538 --> 00:03:54,199
First, we have the humble crosshair.

56
00:03:54,719 --> 00:04:00,582
Baudoin S3 is a shooter and we needed to actually create a deceptively complicated crosshair.

57
00:04:01,202 --> 00:04:06,264
I'm showing six here, but we only have one per weapon type with a few variants to match

58
00:04:06,284 --> 00:04:06,925
the manufacturer.

59
00:04:07,545 --> 00:04:12,447
For example, that second one from the top and from the left is the alternate version

60
00:04:12,467 --> 00:04:13,888
of the TDR shotgun crosshair.

61
00:04:16,585 --> 00:04:17,887
Then we have the Action Skill widget.

62
00:04:18,268 --> 00:04:20,331
On the right is the traditional Action Skill widget,

63
00:04:20,591 --> 00:04:22,634
showing the Beastmaster's Rack Attack ability,

64
00:04:22,774 --> 00:04:25,278
and on the left is the Beastmaster's Spider Ant ability.

65
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,524
Both of these have charges and cooldowns and error states

66
00:04:29,544 --> 00:04:30,986
if the player tries to use it when they can.

67
00:04:31,908 --> 00:04:33,129
We also have an experience bar.

68
00:04:34,231 --> 00:04:36,952
and we have an item card so you can see all the stats for your loot,

69
00:04:37,613 --> 00:04:40,995
and Borderlands 3 is a co-op game so we have buddy widgets so you can see

70
00:04:41,295 --> 00:04:44,777
your friend's stats, and pet health and shield bars,

71
00:04:45,157 --> 00:04:48,458
and a boss bar, and overhead nameplates, and a 3D mini-map,

72
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:52,781
and an inventory system, not to mention a skill system, a big map,

73
00:04:52,941 --> 00:04:54,401
and my personal favorite the options menu.

74
00:04:56,444 --> 00:04:59,967
There's quite a few bits I didn't mention, but when you add in the meetings,

75
00:05:00,007 --> 00:05:03,871
the iterations, and the bugs on top of the implementation, you start feeling

76
00:05:03,891 --> 00:05:04,872
like this tired Corby.

77
00:05:05,933 --> 00:05:09,557
The UI we created isn't perfect, but it's a small miracle we pulled it off.

78
00:05:09,617 --> 00:05:13,300
And it's all thanks to the brilliant and dedicated UI team at Gearbox.

79
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:17,904
Everyone thinks their team is the best, but I know from experience that I worked

80
00:05:17,944 --> 00:05:19,326
with some outstanding individuals.

81
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:26,161
I don't say all of this just to brag, but because it wasn't just the UI team working

82
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:31,763
hard, everybody was firing on all cylinders to get this game to the state it was shipped

83
00:05:31,783 --> 00:05:31,883
in.

84
00:05:33,964 --> 00:05:38,145
So, when I approached our creative director about starting an accessibility strike team,

85
00:05:38,425 --> 00:05:41,746
it was no surprise that he said, only if it didn't derail their work.

86
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,561
that since we had already tried to fit more game in less time,

87
00:05:45,581 --> 00:05:48,902
we would need to be clever in order to keep our efforts in the margins

88
00:05:49,103 --> 00:05:50,623
and not detract from the main game.

89
00:05:51,524 --> 00:05:54,445
I was a bit dismayed by his response, if I'm being honest,

90
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:57,967
but I understood why he reached the conclusion, and we pressed on.

91
00:05:59,068 --> 00:06:00,449
So that's where I want to focus today,

92
00:06:00,969 --> 00:06:03,990
at the intersection of no time, no dedicated resources,

93
00:06:04,471 --> 00:06:07,933
and an already mountain of work to do elsewhere.

94
00:06:08,813 --> 00:06:11,534
I'll be telling six stories that I think best summarize our approach.

95
00:06:12,365 --> 00:06:14,326
First, with our backs against the walls,

96
00:06:14,927 --> 00:06:17,448
our best move was to waste time on Slack.

97
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:22,072
In the beginning, I decided we'd meet once from the outset

98
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:23,853
and to outline our goals

99
00:06:23,873 --> 00:06:25,975
to make sure people could face this name.

100
00:06:26,495 --> 00:06:28,477
Therefore, it was necessary to find a place

101
00:06:28,537 --> 00:06:30,498
we could serve as our home base

102
00:06:30,678 --> 00:06:32,720
without requiring anyone to physically move.

103
00:06:33,781 --> 00:06:36,643
We created a simple chat room anybody in the company,

104
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,205
including our sister studio in Canada could join.

105
00:06:40,242 --> 00:06:46,404
This gave a voice to everyone, allowing any designer, programmer, tester, whatever, to

106
00:06:46,464 --> 00:06:49,685
raise concerns, ask questions, or even offer suggestions.

107
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:53,066
It also provided a place where we could post articles.

108
00:06:53,526 --> 00:06:57,867
These are articles we posted, and more importantly, the resulting conversations from them was

109
00:06:58,027 --> 00:07:00,308
by far the best thing we could have done for the team.

110
00:07:00,908 --> 00:07:04,789
We were able to see what worked for others and define a standard for ourselves.

111
00:07:05,309 --> 00:07:08,870
We were forced to constantly hone and strengthen our beliefs and designs.

112
00:07:09,691 --> 00:07:15,174
Also, by constantly pinging the chatroom with new articles to read, it kept accessibility in the foreground.

113
00:07:15,614 --> 00:07:19,676
It wasn't just an afterthought to us, it was what we talked about day in and day out.

114
00:07:20,657 --> 00:07:22,458
Two articles in particular really stick out.

115
00:07:22,658 --> 00:07:28,621
The first one talks about Domino's Pizza and Robles, a court case headed to the Supreme Court at the time.

116
00:07:29,361 --> 00:07:32,423
It's a fascinating read, and I strongly recommend folks seek it out.

117
00:07:32,983 --> 00:07:37,526
The other article was from Ubisoft and talked about the usage metrics of their accessibility features.

118
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,501
The data showed just how widespread the usage was

119
00:07:40,641 --> 00:07:42,741
and how it demanded the industry start pouring

120
00:07:42,801 --> 00:07:44,402
real resources into their development.

121
00:07:45,222 --> 00:07:47,763
These conversations kept people informed and interested.

122
00:07:48,503 --> 00:07:51,103
Couple that with everyone at Gearbox being able

123
00:07:51,223 --> 00:07:52,544
and encouraged to participate,

124
00:07:52,964 --> 00:07:54,504
it paid massive dividends,

125
00:07:54,684 --> 00:07:55,984
as you'll hear in the other stories.

126
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:57,425
This is where we start,

127
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:59,825
not with a green light from our creative director,

128
00:08:00,385 --> 00:08:02,586
not with a kickoff meeting, but in these discussions.

129
00:08:03,206 --> 00:08:04,686
Without this home-based return to.

130
00:08:05,525 --> 00:08:09,991
Without it constantly stoking the flames, accessibility wouldn't have been in the back

131
00:08:10,011 --> 00:08:11,833
of everyone's mind as they went about their work.

132
00:08:13,775 --> 00:08:17,379
Since we had that open line of communication, we received a few requests.

133
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,080
For example, one day during pre-production,

134
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,781
while we were still figuring out what Borderlands 3 would be

135
00:08:23,841 --> 00:08:26,561
and how we would build it, a member of our QA staff

136
00:08:26,641 --> 00:08:29,362
posted in our chat room that she encountered motion sickness

137
00:08:29,462 --> 00:08:32,622
easily and was concerned that their proposed head bob system,

138
00:08:32,902 --> 00:08:35,823
especially while moving in the recently pitched mech Iron

139
00:08:35,863 --> 00:08:37,163
Bear, would be a problem.

140
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,664
Recognizing the potential here, our animation team

141
00:08:40,744 --> 00:08:42,104
explored possible solutions.

142
00:08:42,644 --> 00:08:44,985
As I mentioned earlier, we were still in pre-pro,

143
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:47,585
and there was just enough time for our animation team.

144
00:08:47,968 --> 00:08:53,792
team to experiment with a few ideas before proposing a solution. A player modifiable

145
00:08:53,852 --> 00:08:58,135
slider that would alter the magnitude of the headbomb with the ability to turn it completely

146
00:08:58,295 --> 00:09:03,058
off. It sounds so simple and straightforward, but with all the gears moving around us,

147
00:09:03,238 --> 00:09:06,861
with all the chaos of development, we weren't confident from the get-go.

148
00:09:08,442 --> 00:09:10,203
After a day or so of experimentation,

149
00:09:11,047 --> 00:09:14,649
It only took the enigmator and myself about 30 minutes to implement the solution.

150
00:09:15,349 --> 00:09:20,011
Had we not started talking about accessibility when we did, with as many people included as

151
00:09:20,071 --> 00:09:24,774
possible, we probably would have ended up with some tacked on afterthought of a solution,

152
00:09:26,055 --> 00:09:32,218
if we could find time for it at all. Now we have a neat little multiplier without re-architecting anyway.

153
00:09:32,941 --> 00:09:37,709
The takeaway here really is to start talking about accessibility as early as possible with

154
00:09:37,809 --> 00:09:39,051
every person possible.

155
00:09:39,772 --> 00:09:42,877
You don't have to make concrete plans, but talk early and often.

156
00:09:43,807 --> 00:09:48,652
Talking about accessibility with everyone can lead to some unseen benefits.

157
00:09:49,353 --> 00:09:51,955
For example, one day while working on the item card,

158
00:09:52,395 --> 00:09:56,759
we realized that it would be difficult for some folks to identify different rarity types at a

159
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:02,125
distance. Early on, we decided not to spawn the item card at large distances, just like we did

160
00:10:02,145 --> 00:10:07,389
with BL2, but experimented with a handful of ideas to help identify the gear.

161
00:10:08,632 --> 00:10:12,873
These ideas included displaying a small icon while looking at the item, like we do in the

162
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:14,414
ship game when the player is a bit closer.

163
00:10:15,234 --> 00:10:19,236
Showing this icon at a larger distance really got in the way of normal play, especially

164
00:10:19,296 --> 00:10:23,117
combat, and it didn't end up being something that we actually went with.

165
00:10:23,798 --> 00:10:27,779
We also thought about displaying an additional icon on the minimap, like how legendaries

166
00:10:27,819 --> 00:10:31,541
are displayed in the shipping game, but this was scrapped over clutter concerns.

167
00:10:33,245 --> 00:10:37,530
After a while, we realized we had hit a brick wall and we asked folks to think about it

168
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:38,791
as we turned our focus elsewhere.

169
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:44,438
A few days later, our absolutely world-class effects director shows up with this.

170
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:51,126
On the side, he had taken it upon himself to create lube beams that scale in intensity

171
00:10:51,426 --> 00:10:53,128
and size with rarity level.

172
00:10:53,995 --> 00:10:58,916
The GIF is a bit artifact, but even if you completely disregard the colors in this GIF,

173
00:10:58,976 --> 00:11:03,417
you can see the differences in heights in the bloom effect of the base of the beam and

174
00:11:03,477 --> 00:11:06,818
how many wispy particles are emitted from the lower portion of the beam.

175
00:11:07,878 --> 00:11:11,339
Common, all the way on the left, has the shortest, most bland effect.

176
00:11:11,819 --> 00:11:16,600
Uncommon, directly to its right, is slightly taller and has a larger base.

177
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:21,881
Rare is taller still, has a slightly larger base, and the occasional wispy particle.

178
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:26,987
Epic has the second tallest base and a constant handful of wispy particles.

179
00:11:28,227 --> 00:11:33,269
And the legendary effect is larger than the gun itself, obscenely tall, has a torrent of

180
00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:37,651
particles at the bottom, and even has a dedicated star icon on the minimap you can see in the top

181
00:11:37,691 --> 00:11:43,473
right. We were totally floored by this approach. We hadn't considered looking at our humble loop

182
00:11:43,493 --> 00:11:49,315
beams. It took a unique perspective to rethink what information loop beams can convey and

183
00:11:49,455 --> 00:11:51,315
unique skill to articulate that concept.

184
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:55,052
So the takeaway here is to empower everyone to experiment.

185
00:11:55,413 --> 00:11:57,314
Not every idea will make it all the way,

186
00:11:57,735 --> 00:11:59,697
but if you encourage everyone to have ownership,

187
00:11:59,977 --> 00:12:01,698
they'll stun you with their ingenuity

188
00:12:01,738 --> 00:12:02,619
and unique approaches.

189
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,263
Honestly, I hope us devs begin to treat accessibility

190
00:12:06,403 --> 00:12:08,305
the same way we treat performance or memory.

191
00:12:08,785 --> 00:12:11,528
It's everyone's responsibility to make the game accessible,

192
00:12:11,768 --> 00:12:13,850
not one dev or even a group of devs

193
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:14,951
off in a corner somewhere.

194
00:12:16,017 --> 00:12:19,999
A few days after these loop beam changes went in, this lesson was further cemented when

195
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,242
one of our audio designers on the team heard about what we did and created unique sound

196
00:12:24,262 --> 00:12:26,223
effects for the different rarities dropping.

197
00:12:27,264 --> 00:12:32,087
It was a well-received change, and our players have this almost Pavlovian response to when

198
00:12:32,207 --> 00:12:34,168
they hear a legendary drop in the world.

199
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:39,151
It's incredible, and it's all thanks to our devs feeling like they were empowered to experiment.

200
00:12:40,812 --> 00:12:43,354
On the other hand, empowering isn't a silver bullet.

201
00:12:44,283 --> 00:12:47,124
For this next story, we thought we had the right idea,

202
00:12:47,324 --> 00:12:48,224
but we fell short.

203
00:12:49,004 --> 00:12:52,445
Unlike movies or TV, just displaying what characters say

204
00:12:52,725 --> 00:12:55,546
really misses critical audio cues our players needed.

205
00:12:56,266 --> 00:12:58,246
Inspired by Minecraft's closed caption system

206
00:12:58,286 --> 00:12:59,086
that you can see here,

207
00:12:59,606 --> 00:13:02,187
we really wanted to display additional text prompts

208
00:13:02,267 --> 00:13:04,668
to alert players to specific events in our world

209
00:13:04,688 --> 00:13:07,908
that they needed to react to.

210
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:10,109
We were also concerned that closed captions

211
00:13:10,229 --> 00:13:12,369
triggered too frequently or a larger number of them.

212
00:13:12,842 --> 00:13:18,607
would take up too much space and much needed screen real estate and overall lead to a negative experience.

213
00:13:19,468 --> 00:13:25,393
So we opted for captions that would only message comment information that was needed immediately,

214
00:13:25,413 --> 00:13:27,675
that wasn't already visually messaged somehow.

215
00:13:29,397 --> 00:13:34,379
In the final version, this meant that we displayed closed captions for barrels igniting or exploding

216
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:40,262
within the range of the player, as well as when base bosses begin certain wind-up animations.

217
00:13:41,043 --> 00:13:43,984
As you can see here in the center and the right images, respectively.

218
00:13:44,585 --> 00:13:48,887
It also meant, for example, that we didn't caption grenades landing on the player, since

219
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:51,889
we had a dedicated widget for them, as seen on the far left.

220
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,871
This wasn't received very well.

221
00:14:00,467 --> 00:14:05,771
Essentially, and I 100% agree in retrospect, the reviewer is calling out that we simply

222
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:07,632
didn't caption everything we should have.

223
00:14:08,372 --> 00:14:14,517
That we missed environmental hazards or additional attacks from non-boss enemies, and they also

224
00:14:14,577 --> 00:14:18,320
called out that we should have captioned emotion or sound effects in our subtitles.

225
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:23,984
That by limiting ourselves to combat captions, our dialogue lost some of its punch when being

226
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:24,264
read.

227
00:14:25,225 --> 00:14:27,807
In the end, nothing beats testing with your target audience.

228
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:34,397
Personally, not being able to find the time in our schedule to make more user testing happen was our number one flaw.

229
00:14:35,418 --> 00:14:41,985
We should have figured out a way to focus test these features more thoroughly so that when we shipped the game, we started off on the right foot.

230
00:14:43,667 --> 00:14:47,992
That said, sometimes we don't have to look very far to make sure that we're on the right foot.

231
00:14:49,921 --> 00:14:54,483
Fresh off of Battleborn, we wanted to provide expansive color options to accommodate players.

232
00:14:55,043 --> 00:15:00,046
As you can see here, on Battleborn, we gave players the ability to recolor not just parts

233
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:05,348
of the UI, like the crosshair and the nameplates and the health bars, but also the detailing

234
00:15:05,368 --> 00:15:07,949
of the minions, the sentries, and even the build nodes.

235
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:14,812
When it came to Borderlands 3, we started wanting to implement an equivalent idea of

236
00:15:14,892 --> 00:15:15,493
color swaps.

237
00:15:16,475 --> 00:15:19,796
It's about this time that I learned that one of our UI designers is colorblind.

238
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,537
I had never known, and it was none of my business.

239
00:15:22,877 --> 00:15:24,477
It just simply hadn't come up until now.

240
00:15:25,237 --> 00:15:29,259
He's a fantastic artist and he really took the time to dive in deep and figure out

241
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:32,680
what color information we needed to have alternate messaging for.

242
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:38,361
What he found was that rarity was almost always in plain text.

243
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:42,823
And when it wasn't, that plain text for the rarity's name was always quick to obtain.

244
00:15:43,634 --> 00:15:48,495
For example, you can navigate to an item and see its rarity quickly in all of our item menus.

245
00:15:49,256 --> 00:15:56,198
The same is true for the elemental damage types, which always have unique icons and are always spelled out in plain text.

246
00:15:58,278 --> 00:16:06,920
We also figured out that the crosshair was the only widget that relied solely on color to convey whether the player is aiming at a friendly, an enemy, or neither.

247
00:16:07,861 --> 00:16:13,062
When we realized this, we just couldn't justify the amount of time we need in our already crammed schedule.

248
00:16:13,418 --> 00:16:18,420
for a full color wheel, or even for a color picker for just the one widget, and opted

249
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,040
for a set number of baked-in colors the player could choose from.

250
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:27,341
He and some other devs figured out what would be the best preset color options, and with

251
00:16:27,381 --> 00:16:32,082
his approval, we knew we had a solid list without spending unnecessary time making something

252
00:16:32,122 --> 00:16:34,643
that would be overkill for our specific needs.

253
00:16:36,143 --> 00:16:37,303
The takeaway here is simple.

254
00:16:38,224 --> 00:16:39,924
Challenge yourself to think elegantly.

255
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:45,113
The large, deluxe version of a feature is nice, but is it the best use of your time?

256
00:16:45,673 --> 00:16:47,694
Can that time be freed up and used elsewhere?

257
00:16:48,855 --> 00:16:53,377
I can't say for certain just how much time we saved going this route, let alone what

258
00:16:53,397 --> 00:16:58,480
it was used for, but I'm certain everyone here will agree with me that our time is precious

259
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:03,062
and needs to be saved where it can be so we can absorb the nasty surprises that somehow

260
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:05,483
always rear their heads the worst possible time.

261
00:17:07,624 --> 00:17:09,345
Speaking of less than great surprises...

262
00:17:11,282 --> 00:17:16,165
Even with buy-in from the team, some devs, with their minds on deadlines and with the

263
00:17:16,265 --> 00:17:21,529
very best of intentions, won't be easily convinced that accessibility should be a higher priority.

264
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:27,733
As I'm sure anyone here can attest to, these devs have to make hard choices on what receives

265
00:17:27,753 --> 00:17:30,075
their attention and what doesn't every day.

266
00:17:30,095 --> 00:17:35,039
And it's sometimes difficult for folks to remember what a wide-ranging impact accessibility

267
00:17:35,059 --> 00:17:35,699
features can have.

268
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:42,114
Even with our in-the-margin strategy, we still had a few instances of this, but one particular

269
00:17:42,154 --> 00:17:42,975
example sticks out.

270
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:48,299
An early milestone was approaching, and a designer had learned about the head bob scaling

271
00:17:48,339 --> 00:17:49,600
feature I mentioned previously.

272
00:17:50,321 --> 00:17:56,226
He only learned about the feature itself, not about how we approached it or how little

273
00:17:56,266 --> 00:17:57,587
time we actually spent on it.

274
00:17:59,461 --> 00:18:03,123
He assumed that we had spent a lot of time and resources on the feature and vocalized

275
00:18:03,163 --> 00:18:04,464
his dismay about our approach.

276
00:18:05,224 --> 00:18:09,467
By learning of the feature from the results and not from the process, he was concerned

277
00:18:09,507 --> 00:18:11,308
we were shirking our other responsibilities.

278
00:18:12,349 --> 00:18:16,631
He posted on our Slack channel, and before I could even type out a response, the conversation

279
00:18:16,671 --> 00:18:17,592
quickly became heated.

280
00:18:18,412 --> 00:18:24,136
On the one hand, this is a spark of high drama aimed at a powder keg of anxious dads trying

281
00:18:24,176 --> 00:18:24,936
to make deadlines.

282
00:18:25,837 --> 00:18:31,240
But on the other hand, I was weirdly glad he felt confident enough to say something in such a public way.

283
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:37,203
It maybe wasn't the best phrasing, but I'm sure he wasn't the only one who came to such a conclusion,

284
00:18:37,604 --> 00:18:40,866
and it gave us a chance to either confirm that we were on the right track,

285
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,807
or have an outside observer call us on something we missed.

286
00:18:44,868 --> 00:18:49,851
In the end, taking the time to explain the process one-on-one, in our case over a beer after work,

287
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:54,572
turned a powder keg of a situation into something that reinforced our confidence.

288
00:18:54,912 --> 00:18:58,493
It also turned a vocal skeptic into a vocal proponent of our approach.

289
00:18:59,754 --> 00:19:03,515
So the takeaway here is nothing surprising. Make room for dissenting opinions

290
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:07,917
and approach them and those with them with respect rather than drama.

291
00:19:10,598 --> 00:19:16,100
So those are my stories. As a quick recap, and if you want to take a picture or a screenshot

292
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,061
of this slide, now is definitely the time.

293
00:19:19,553 --> 00:19:21,534
Chat rooms keep accessibility in the foreground.

294
00:19:22,074 --> 00:19:23,896
Talk early, often, and with everyone.

295
00:19:25,717 --> 00:19:26,997
Empower experimentation.

296
00:19:27,478 --> 00:19:28,118
Test often.

297
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,259
Think elegantly.

298
00:19:29,859 --> 00:19:31,180
And leave room for dissension.

299
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,383
I'm going to pause here for people to take screenshots.

300
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:36,743
Great.

301
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:44,065
Here are some of the articles that I use either for this talk or when discussing features and

302
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:49,830
approaches with the team, in addition to my Twitter handle and those that I frequently

303
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:56,615
communicate about accessibility options. I'm going to pause here, but other than that,

304
00:19:56,976 --> 00:19:58,016
thank you for listening to my talk.
