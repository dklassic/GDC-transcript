1
00:00:04,177 --> 00:00:09,820
Welcome. Thanks for coming out. I really appreciate it.

2
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:14,102
So you're here to talk about, or to listen to me talk about Broken Age

3
00:00:14,102 --> 00:00:19,665
and the animation style and workflow.

4
00:00:19,665 --> 00:00:23,147
Let me start off by telling you a little bit about Broken Age.

5
00:00:23,147 --> 00:00:27,029
If you haven't played the game, it's a point-and-click adventure game.

6
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:31,812
It's a story that deals with a young boy who is trying to find his own independence.

7
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:36,161
and about a girl who is trying to save her village.

8
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:40,041
The way that I'll proceed is I will talk a little bit

9
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:42,322
about my own background, just briefly,

10
00:00:42,322 --> 00:00:45,402
and then I'll go into the inspirations

11
00:00:45,402 --> 00:00:47,243
of the Broken Age animation style,

12
00:00:47,243 --> 00:00:49,523
and then I'll go into sort of the nuts and bolts

13
00:00:49,523 --> 00:00:52,724
of how we did it, and I'll try to leave

14
00:00:52,724 --> 00:00:54,944
a little bit of time at the end for some Q&A

15
00:00:54,944 --> 00:00:56,385
if anybody has any questions.

16
00:00:56,385 --> 00:01:01,826
So I have been in the industry for 14 years.

17
00:01:02,822 --> 00:01:05,964
For 14 of those years I've been at Double Fine.

18
00:01:05,964 --> 00:01:08,806
So I have been there my entire career.

19
00:01:08,806 --> 00:01:15,410
I think in game developer years, that equals somewhere around 800 years, I would say.

20
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:18,312
I'm the Yoda of the studio.

21
00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:24,476
The hair growing in my ears now and bald head, everything.

22
00:01:24,476 --> 00:01:27,077
In my time at Double Fine, I've...

23
00:01:27,525 --> 00:01:30,867
had several roles, primarily animation,

24
00:01:30,867 --> 00:01:34,029
but I've also done rigging and character modeling as well,

25
00:01:34,029 --> 00:01:37,011
which came in handy during the pre-production of this game.

26
00:01:37,011 --> 00:01:43,214
Just briefly, I worked on Psychonauts as an animator,

27
00:01:43,214 --> 00:01:46,436
Brutal Legend, Once Upon a Monster,

28
00:01:46,436 --> 00:01:48,717
I was the lead animator on that game,

29
00:01:48,717 --> 00:01:49,538
Costume Quest.

30
00:01:50,053 --> 00:01:52,414
Did some work on that, Middlemanager of Justice,

31
00:01:52,414 --> 00:01:56,296
which was the first time I'd done some 2D animation

32
00:01:56,296 --> 00:01:57,896
professionally.

33
00:01:57,896 --> 00:01:59,837
And then Autonomous, which I don't know,

34
00:01:59,837 --> 00:02:01,438
some of you may have heard of Autonomous.

35
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:05,019
Worked on that with Lee Petty.

36
00:02:05,019 --> 00:02:07,960
And Hack and Slash was also 2D.

37
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,481
So having that 2D and 3D experience

38
00:02:11,481 --> 00:02:15,023
actually came in handy with Broken Age.

39
00:02:15,023 --> 00:02:17,203
So let's go ahead and get started.

40
00:02:19,357 --> 00:02:24,218
In 2012, after a 13-year break from the point-and-click adventure game genre,

41
00:02:24,218 --> 00:02:29,799
Tim Schafer saw an opportunity through Kickstarter to return to that genre,

42
00:02:29,799 --> 00:02:34,540
and he ran a successful Kickstarter campaign, which you may have heard of,

43
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,301
and the game that came out of that was Broken Age.

44
00:02:37,301 --> 00:02:43,042
Tim tapped me early on and asked me if I was interested in coming onto the team

45
00:02:43,042 --> 00:02:46,123
and lead the animation group and come up and develop.

46
00:02:46,614 --> 00:02:48,236
of the animation pipeline.

47
00:02:48,236 --> 00:02:50,538
Now I'd worked with Tim on two other games,

48
00:02:50,538 --> 00:02:53,140
Psychonauts and Brutal Legend,

49
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:57,404
totaling almost 10 years of my life.

50
00:02:57,404 --> 00:03:00,206
Tim told me this would be a short game,

51
00:03:00,206 --> 00:03:01,908
probably one year long.

52
00:03:01,908 --> 00:03:05,150
So we are now three years.

53
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,893
My relationship with Tim is I love him very much,

54
00:03:07,893 --> 00:03:10,515
but when it comes to working on his projects,

55
00:03:10,515 --> 00:03:11,836
I feel much like this woman.

56
00:03:17,362 --> 00:03:21,204
At the end of this ride, I'm sure she still loved her son,

57
00:03:21,204 --> 00:03:25,167
just like I loved him at the end of the projects.

58
00:03:25,167 --> 00:03:28,490
But they can be difficult and painful at times,

59
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,271
but also very rewarding.

60
00:03:30,271 --> 00:03:31,993
So.

61
00:03:34,111 --> 00:03:38,934
Tim knew that he wanted the art of the game to be based off of Nathan Stapley's art style.

62
00:03:38,934 --> 00:03:42,717
Nathan had been at the studio for even longer than I had,

63
00:03:42,717 --> 00:03:45,498
and Tim had always really appreciated his work.

64
00:03:45,498 --> 00:03:48,240
And I was very familiar with it.

65
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,763
These are actually three paintings that hang in my home that he did.

66
00:03:52,763 --> 00:03:56,485
So I was really excited to be able to come onto a game

67
00:03:56,485 --> 00:04:02,209
and actually develop an animation system where we'd be able to bring his style to life.

68
00:04:06,764 --> 00:04:13,953
Early on in the process, we had some studio artists, Lee Petty, who was the art director on the game,

69
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:15,896
Scott Campbell, Nathan Stapley.

70
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:20,421
Peter Chan, they were all doing just some character mock-ups.

71
00:04:20,421 --> 00:04:24,044
I was not on the project yet, but I was monitoring the forums.

72
00:04:24,044 --> 00:04:26,626
We have some internal forums and I was keeping an eye on those forums

73
00:04:26,626 --> 00:04:30,550
and just seeing what kind of styles they were coming up with

74
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:33,972
just so that I could start thinking about what type of animation we'd want to do.

75
00:04:33,972 --> 00:04:37,015
We did know at this point we were going to do 3D,

76
00:04:37,015 --> 00:04:38,876
but that's all that we knew.

77
00:04:38,876 --> 00:04:44,922
Lee Petty, who I mentioned before,

78
00:04:44,922 --> 00:04:45,702
he and I were...

79
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:49,855
taking our lunch breaks and we were going into one of the back rooms and we were doing

80
00:04:49,855 --> 00:04:54,777
just some drawing sessions. And for a couple of those sessions we were focusing on sort

81
00:04:54,777 --> 00:05:00,999
of a mid-century modern style, a very somewhat limited but really beautiful designs. UPA,

82
00:05:00,999 --> 00:05:06,941
which you may have heard of, is one of the studios that's known for that. And then

83
00:05:08,062 --> 00:05:11,924
I was also really interested in Charlie Harper at the time,

84
00:05:11,924 --> 00:05:13,465
the late illustrator Charlie Harper.

85
00:05:13,465 --> 00:05:15,807
I thought his silhouettes were really bold,

86
00:05:15,807 --> 00:05:18,168
he had a really graphic style, but also very expressive.

87
00:05:18,168 --> 00:05:22,931
And I thought it could actually work

88
00:05:22,931 --> 00:05:26,413
if we ended up going with Nathan's style,

89
00:05:26,413 --> 00:05:27,354
which is very painterly.

90
00:05:27,354 --> 00:05:29,796
I thought it would work with those backgrounds.

91
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:35,619
Then I decided to start doing some animation research,

92
00:05:35,619 --> 00:05:36,420
started looking at the old...

93
00:05:37,981 --> 00:05:39,302
LucasArts adventure games.

94
00:05:39,302 --> 00:05:46,485
When I started looking at those, I realized though that they were extremely limited back

95
00:05:46,485 --> 00:05:46,845
then.

96
00:05:46,845 --> 00:05:51,527
Really beautiful in their own way, but most of the animation was probably about five frames

97
00:05:51,527 --> 00:05:52,107
per second.

98
00:05:52,107 --> 00:05:56,709
I knew that we wanted to have more fidelity than that for this game.

99
00:05:56,709 --> 00:06:05,593
So at the time I was playing Year Walk, as well as Machinarium.

100
00:06:07,261 --> 00:06:18,410
And I really appreciated the level of puppetry that those games had, but I didn't want it

101
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,092
to feel like paper cutouts.

102
00:06:24,923 --> 00:06:28,625
Rayman Origins came out around the time that we were starting to develop our pipeline.

103
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:31,787
I knew that we didn't need it to be that fleshy.

104
00:06:31,787 --> 00:06:32,948
This was an adventure game.

105
00:06:32,948 --> 00:06:34,429
It wasn't a platformer.

106
00:06:34,429 --> 00:06:37,170
We didn't need to have that much squash and stretch, but we took a lot of inspiration

107
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:39,051
from the game and from the UB art pipeline.

108
00:06:39,051 --> 00:06:44,774
One of their animators and art directors actually did a talk at GDC a couple years back, which

109
00:06:44,774 --> 00:06:48,056
was very inspirational in what we did.

110
00:06:48,056 --> 00:06:49,477
I also looked at...

111
00:06:50,104 --> 00:06:52,926
shadow puppetry. I didn't...

112
00:06:52,926 --> 00:06:55,808
I knew we wouldn't want something as stiff as that,

113
00:06:55,808 --> 00:06:58,671
but definitely took some inspiration from it.

114
00:06:58,671 --> 00:07:00,292
Eventually I went to Tim, and I said,

115
00:07:00,292 --> 00:07:06,077
Tim, well, what do you want to see in this game?

116
00:07:06,077 --> 00:07:08,319
And, you know, I wanted to get his thoughts.

117
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,181
And his thoughts were,

118
00:07:10,181 --> 00:07:11,742
do something cool.

119
00:07:11,742 --> 00:07:13,203
That's what he told me.

120
00:07:13,203 --> 00:07:18,628
And my response, which is typical, is...

121
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:23,476
throwing an angry furrow in his direction.

122
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:26,719
But eventually I realized

123
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:30,182
that was the best advice that he could give me.

124
00:07:30,182 --> 00:07:33,365
He gave me the opportunity to explore creatively

125
00:07:33,365 --> 00:07:33,946
without boxing me in.

126
00:07:33,946 --> 00:07:35,387
And so I really appreciated that.

127
00:07:35,387 --> 00:07:39,931
So our discoveries.

128
00:07:39,931 --> 00:07:42,133
The art styles had expanded quite a bit.

129
00:07:42,133 --> 00:07:45,756
I knew we'd need lots of expression and fidelity in this game.

130
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:48,701
We wanted to show off bold silhouettes.

131
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:51,222
It would not be a 3D game,

132
00:07:51,222 --> 00:07:55,105
so each view had to have a very nice, bold silhouette.

133
00:07:55,105 --> 00:07:59,688
It needed to be compatible with many of our current tools

134
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:02,430
that included modeling, animation, and rigging,

135
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,671
as well as implementation.

136
00:08:03,671 --> 00:08:05,272
We didn't have the budget or the time

137
00:08:05,272 --> 00:08:07,734
to build an entire new suite of tools.

138
00:08:07,734 --> 00:08:14,298
We knew we were gonna go with 2D planes.

139
00:08:17,318 --> 00:08:19,860
And then we're going to use alpha channels for the soft edges

140
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,642
because we wanted to preserve that look of Nathan's painting style.

141
00:08:22,642 --> 00:08:29,087
And after talking to the programmers, it was decided

142
00:08:29,087 --> 00:08:32,089
we should use a runtime joint-driven system.

143
00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:37,013
We would get huge memory savings, a much smaller memory footprint.

144
00:08:37,013 --> 00:08:39,334
It would also give us the fidelity that we wanted,

145
00:08:39,334 --> 00:08:42,397
knowing that we were going to get lots of dialogue

146
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:43,558
that we would be animating to.

147
00:08:43,558 --> 00:08:46,220
So, my advice, listen to the programmers.

148
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,421
They are probably better at math than you are.

149
00:08:49,421 --> 00:08:50,842
They have the numbers to back it up.

150
00:08:50,842 --> 00:08:56,084
And we would introduce a new system called flipbook animation.

151
00:08:56,084 --> 00:08:58,466
And all that is, it's pretty simple.

152
00:08:58,466 --> 00:09:04,069
It's keyable texture planes that you can just turn the visibility on and off.

153
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:08,895
So we'd go with a hybrid approach, which we called 2.5D.

154
00:09:08,895 --> 00:09:12,197
That can mean different things at different studios,

155
00:09:12,197 --> 00:09:14,718
but what it meant at our studio was

156
00:09:14,718 --> 00:09:17,199
flat layer texture planes with transparency,

157
00:09:17,199 --> 00:09:20,401
and they're bound to joint chains,

158
00:09:20,401 --> 00:09:23,202
and each piece of geometry could be turned on and off,

159
00:09:23,202 --> 00:09:25,023
the visibility could be turned on and off.

160
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:30,786
Next we needed to decide how many views we would need

161
00:09:30,786 --> 00:09:33,287
for each character to get the desired fidelity.

162
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:37,914
So this was an early test.

163
00:09:37,914 --> 00:09:40,596
When Tim did the Kickstarter, he didn't have a story,

164
00:09:40,596 --> 00:09:44,079
he didn't have a design, he didn't have any treatment.

165
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:49,383
He wanted the backers to experience

166
00:09:49,383 --> 00:09:51,385
building a game from the very beginning,

167
00:09:51,385 --> 00:09:52,606
even before there was an idea.

168
00:09:52,606 --> 00:09:55,588
And so we couldn't just sit idle as a team,

169
00:09:55,588 --> 00:09:58,231
and so we came up with this scenario,

170
00:09:58,231 --> 00:10:00,232
which we called the Hipster Lumberjack.

171
00:10:00,846 --> 00:10:03,428
And the hipster lumberjack actually ended up in the game

172
00:10:03,428 --> 00:10:05,169
because the backers loved him so much.

173
00:10:05,169 --> 00:10:06,891
He went through a little bit of an evolution.

174
00:10:06,891 --> 00:10:09,453
But this was sort of the first prototype version

175
00:10:09,453 --> 00:10:10,493
of hipster lumberjack.

176
00:10:10,493 --> 00:10:13,276
It's the first model that we built out,

177
00:10:13,276 --> 00:10:15,958
and it's the first rig.

178
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:17,279
Initially, we thought we were going

179
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,480
to need to do three separate rigs for every view.

180
00:10:20,097 --> 00:10:23,199
But ultimately, with this test, we proved,

181
00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:25,700
okay, we can get away with just one rig,

182
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,481
and we would just put all the views,

183
00:10:27,481 --> 00:10:30,723
we'd put the front, the side, and the back views

184
00:10:30,723 --> 00:10:31,883
all on the same rig.

185
00:10:31,883 --> 00:10:33,985
So you can see here, I did this really simple walk,

186
00:10:33,985 --> 00:10:37,907
and then I'm just turning the views on and off,

187
00:10:37,907 --> 00:10:40,168
each different view, and I did very little changes

188
00:10:40,168 --> 00:10:42,169
to the actual animation.

189
00:10:42,169 --> 00:10:45,591
You can see it's a little janky on the ankles and stuff,

190
00:10:45,591 --> 00:10:47,612
but it did prove out that we could do it.

191
00:10:50,238 --> 00:10:56,840
So, really quickly, so what we have here, I decided, okay, well, I see that we can have

192
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:00,901
a front, side, and back, but how are these going to all work together?

193
00:11:00,901 --> 00:11:05,702
Or would we be able to overlap the flipbooks?

194
00:11:05,702 --> 00:11:11,343
And so I did, okay, let's do a turn, a 180 turn, because the head leads, and then the

195
00:11:11,343 --> 00:11:14,864
body comes along, and then the legs come along after that.

196
00:11:16,213 --> 00:11:20,116
And so there's actually very little joint animation here.

197
00:11:20,116 --> 00:11:24,439
It's almost all just flip books turning on and off.

198
00:11:24,439 --> 00:11:30,965
You'll notice though that the arm travels across the body

199
00:11:30,965 --> 00:11:33,086
and then just before it gets to the back view,

200
00:11:33,086 --> 00:11:36,229
it pops back into the position that it was in before.

201
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:39,711
Here it is, it's a little bit slower.

202
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:51,904
And so the character is in the same view, is in the same pose, front and back, it's just the flip books are turning on and off.

203
00:11:51,904 --> 00:11:57,527
Next, we decided, okay, we're going to have a lot of dialogue, let's do a quick dialogue test.

204
00:11:57,527 --> 00:12:05,710
So, I don't know if you know who Chris Remo is, you might know him from Idle Thumbs, the podcast, he was nice enough to do some scratch dialogue for us.

205
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:06,471
And we ran this test.

206
00:12:06,471 --> 00:12:09,932
With no sound.

207
00:12:09,932 --> 00:12:12,073
That's interesting.

208
00:12:12,943 --> 00:12:16,285
Well, it gets the point across.

209
00:12:16,285 --> 00:12:18,605
That's just flipbook mouth with

210
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:24,867
joint driven. Everything else is joint driven except for the mouth

211
00:12:24,867 --> 00:12:28,749
is all flipbooks. Hopefully we have sound for the other

212
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:33,090
slides, I hope, when we get into the cutscenes.

213
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:36,731
Okay, so front, side, and back view.

214
00:12:36,731 --> 00:12:40,593
You'll notice though that we didn't do straight on views. We didn't do

215
00:12:41,384 --> 00:12:44,787
We didn't do a totally front-facing face,

216
00:12:44,787 --> 00:12:47,949
or a totally profile face, or a total straight back view.

217
00:12:47,949 --> 00:12:53,393
And we did that because we didn't want the characters to flatten out against the backgrounds,

218
00:12:53,393 --> 00:12:55,274
and so it just kept some dimensionality on them.

219
00:12:55,274 --> 00:13:01,579
Alright, modeling a character with this system.

220
00:13:01,579 --> 00:13:03,040
Super simple.

221
00:13:03,886 --> 00:13:06,427
would take just a few hours to model a character out.

222
00:13:06,427 --> 00:13:09,749
So what the 2D artists would do is they would create

223
00:13:09,749 --> 00:13:12,611
a character and any piece of the character

224
00:13:12,611 --> 00:13:15,633
that needed to be on its own plane,

225
00:13:15,633 --> 00:13:16,653
they would just break out.

226
00:13:16,653 --> 00:13:19,415
And so it was this exploded view.

227
00:13:19,415 --> 00:13:21,136
And we would take that exploded view

228
00:13:21,136 --> 00:13:22,977
and we would just bring it into Maya

229
00:13:22,977 --> 00:13:24,958
and we would build planes around that view.

230
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:27,039
And then we would just UV map.

231
00:13:29,025 --> 00:13:31,306
the textures onto those planes.

232
00:13:31,306 --> 00:13:32,767
So it's very simple.

233
00:13:32,767 --> 00:13:35,909
Most of the work was in all the painting,

234
00:13:35,909 --> 00:13:38,670
but actually building the model didn't take very long.

235
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,591
Let's do a little bit of a closeup

236
00:13:40,591 --> 00:13:45,433
on how we did the eyes and the face.

237
00:13:45,433 --> 00:13:49,535
If you look, we just did proper edge loops around the eyes

238
00:13:49,535 --> 00:13:51,376
because we knew we wanted to have

239
00:13:51,376 --> 00:13:52,296
a lot of expression in the eyes.

240
00:13:52,296 --> 00:13:55,018
All we were gonna have was eyes and mouth

241
00:13:55,018 --> 00:13:57,339
for facial expression, really.

242
00:13:57,339 --> 00:13:57,819
And so we...

243
00:13:58,827 --> 00:14:03,930
we made sure to do proper edges, just like if you did a 3D model.

244
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:07,291
You'll look here.

245
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:10,693
We cut a hole in the eye socket, and the reason for that is

246
00:14:10,693 --> 00:14:14,316
we wanted the pupils to be able to be obscured by the skull,

247
00:14:14,316 --> 00:14:17,998
or the brows, however you want to put it.

248
00:14:17,998 --> 00:14:21,680
And then, here's the whole face broken up.

249
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,441
You'll see those are the eyelids.

250
00:14:25,425 --> 00:14:28,327
And then that's what we call the eyeball plate,

251
00:14:28,327 --> 00:14:29,568
and then there's the pupil,

252
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:31,889
and then the specularity just sat on top,

253
00:14:31,889 --> 00:14:34,311
and those are all just separate planes.

254
00:14:34,311 --> 00:14:38,814
And I like the specularity being separate from the pupil

255
00:14:38,814 --> 00:14:41,996
because when the eyeball would move around,

256
00:14:41,996 --> 00:14:43,757
I didn't want the light of the eye

257
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:44,998
or the specularity of the eye moving.

258
00:14:44,998 --> 00:14:46,119
I wanted it to stay in the same position

259
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:47,840
as if the light stayed in the same position

260
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,500
and the eye would move.

261
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,142
It just gave a nice round, wet look to the eye.

262
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:55,965
Rigging a character, pretty simple rigs.

263
00:14:55,965 --> 00:14:57,666
Ended up being about 20 to 60 joints.

264
00:14:57,666 --> 00:15:00,188
We were asked to not go over 50 joints,

265
00:15:00,188 --> 00:15:04,111
but occasionally we pushed it into the 60 range.

266
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:06,974
What you're seeing there is we wanted IK on the legs,

267
00:15:06,974 --> 00:15:11,898
and we added an extra control above the IK leg system

268
00:15:11,898 --> 00:15:13,940
so that we could pull the legs either out,

269
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,482
but mostly we could pull the legs in together

270
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:18,143
so if a character went into profile,

271
00:15:18,143 --> 00:15:19,765
the legs would be close together.

272
00:15:21,085 --> 00:15:26,288
We broke the arms out as separate

273
00:15:26,288 --> 00:15:31,230
They're not attached to the body, but then the clavicle though, let's see if I got into that

274
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,932
I can't see it here on my monitor, so I have to look up there

275
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:34,212
and

276
00:15:34,212 --> 00:15:40,295
the reason we did that is so the arms that shoulders can actually go across the side of the body to give the feeling of

277
00:15:40,295 --> 00:15:41,435
The character would be turning

278
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:46,921
And then I wanted the clavicles, though, to still be attached to the torso and deform,

279
00:15:46,921 --> 00:15:51,403
just to give it a more organic feeling, as well as the spine.

280
00:15:51,403 --> 00:15:56,144
And then we could do some scaling in the spine as well.

281
00:15:56,144 --> 00:15:59,385
We could do non-uniform scaling, which was really nice, we could get some squash and

282
00:15:59,385 --> 00:16:00,726
stretch.

283
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:08,508
And the head was also separate, so that we could move it in X, Y, and Z translation.

284
00:16:08,508 --> 00:16:11,810
Okay, so what you're looking here...

285
00:16:13,342 --> 00:16:16,583
This is our flipbook system working with the joints.

286
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:19,604
You can see when it turns into profile,

287
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:20,864
all it is is just flat plane.

288
00:16:20,864 --> 00:16:21,544
And this character has,

289
00:16:21,544 --> 00:16:24,866
so if you look at the bottom of the character,

290
00:16:24,866 --> 00:16:28,967
not the head with the bottom,

291
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:31,128
it's actually just flipping between

292
00:16:31,128 --> 00:16:33,049
a front view and a side view.

293
00:16:33,049 --> 00:16:35,690
And then the top is using three different views,

294
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:39,071
which is a front view, a side view, and a back view.

295
00:16:39,071 --> 00:16:41,552
And it gives it almost a 3D look to it.

296
00:16:41,552 --> 00:16:42,932
Here it is with just.

297
00:16:44,131 --> 00:16:47,272
These are just the planes without any texture on it.

298
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:54,134
In the first act of Broken Age,

299
00:16:54,134 --> 00:16:58,375
we actually did not have a very good flip book system

300
00:16:58,375 --> 00:16:59,736
for turning them on and off.

301
00:16:59,736 --> 00:17:02,317
So you'd have to go and dig through all these menus

302
00:17:02,317 --> 00:17:04,877
in the channel box and you had to manually key it.

303
00:17:04,877 --> 00:17:06,718
But then for the second act,

304
00:17:06,718 --> 00:17:09,179
because we found that to be such a pain,

305
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:11,119
one of our TDs built this system for us,

306
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,300
this tool for us that would.

307
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:19,183
organize all the flipbooks and you could filter them if you wanted to and then all you had to do

308
00:17:19,183 --> 00:17:23,706
is just click on them you could even scroll down anytime it goes yellow that means it's turned on

309
00:17:23,706 --> 00:17:28,289
if you have autos key set it just automatically turns it on and off and sets a key for you

310
00:17:28,289 --> 00:17:31,771
and so it actually sped the process up dramatically.

311
00:17:39,734 --> 00:17:44,417
Okay, so let's look at the head and facial setup.

312
00:17:44,417 --> 00:17:47,339
So, if you look at these two characters,

313
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:49,501
when we rigged the head up,

314
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:52,122
we made sure to use world orientation.

315
00:17:52,122 --> 00:17:53,783
And the reason we did that

316
00:17:53,783 --> 00:17:55,384
is because we wanted to scale the character.

317
00:17:55,384 --> 00:17:58,346
If this character wanted to look from left to right,

318
00:17:58,346 --> 00:18:00,168
we would just scale everything in negative X.

319
00:18:00,168 --> 00:18:03,570
And we would hide that, the pop,

320
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:07,032
just by adding some squash and some stretch to the head,

321
00:18:07,032 --> 00:18:08,073
you know, blink the eyes.

322
00:18:08,675 --> 00:18:12,256
and that hid most of that.

323
00:18:12,256 --> 00:18:13,656
You can see it here.

324
00:18:13,656 --> 00:18:15,716
This is just with the planes turned on,

325
00:18:15,716 --> 00:18:16,857
the textures turned off.

326
00:18:16,857 --> 00:18:18,617
You can see when the eyes blink,

327
00:18:18,617 --> 00:18:20,157
there's just a flip book that turns on.

328
00:18:20,157 --> 00:18:28,539
So it's a pretty simple system, but it's effective.

329
00:18:28,539 --> 00:18:30,040
Okay, VisiumSet.

330
00:18:34,173 --> 00:18:36,513
So the way that the mouths worked on the characters

331
00:18:36,513 --> 00:18:38,454
is we would just do replacement animation,

332
00:18:38,454 --> 00:18:41,234
just like you would in certain stop motion films.

333
00:18:41,234 --> 00:18:43,975
We didn't have a lot of,

334
00:18:43,975 --> 00:18:45,975
you could scale the mouth a little bit

335
00:18:45,975 --> 00:18:48,556
because it was bound to a mouth joint,

336
00:18:48,556 --> 00:18:51,377
but mostly we would just turn the different V-zines on.

337
00:18:51,377 --> 00:18:55,738
And the 2D artists would send us this V-zine set,

338
00:18:55,738 --> 00:18:59,098
we would then map that onto just a geometric plane,

339
00:18:59,098 --> 00:18:59,878
each one separately,

340
00:18:59,878 --> 00:19:02,659
and then we would bind that to a mouth joint.

341
00:19:03,218 --> 00:19:06,200
We ended up only doing front view.

342
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:11,244
We thought, oh, we'd need the side view too,

343
00:19:11,244 --> 00:19:14,267
because characters talk when they're facing sideways.

344
00:19:14,267 --> 00:19:22,794
But we realized you could just scale the mouth a little bit,

345
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:24,455
and that worked just fine.

346
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:26,136
And so that saved us quite a bit of time.

347
00:19:26,136 --> 00:19:27,177
Do we have sound?

348
00:19:27,177 --> 00:19:27,597
Head east.

349
00:19:27,597 --> 00:19:29,059
There is an extremely territorial snake

350
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:29,519
in the other direction.

351
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:29,639
Gotcha.

352
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:34,700
Okay, so that was just a test, um, just showing how the flipbook mouse worked with some dialogue.

353
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:40,862
Alright, animation types. So we had kind of three main animation types.

354
00:19:40,862 --> 00:19:44,183
We had fully animated cutscenes, which are all hand animated, and vignettes.

355
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:47,884
And vignettes were a fully animated cutscene, but...

356
00:19:48,932 --> 00:19:52,434
with no camera. The camera was just using the game camera.

357
00:19:52,434 --> 00:19:54,435
And usually gameplay was still going on,

358
00:19:54,435 --> 00:19:57,557
but there might be a couple of characters doing something together in the background,

359
00:19:57,557 --> 00:19:59,639
so we considered those vignettes.

360
00:19:59,639 --> 00:20:01,800
We did scripted cutscenes,

361
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,520
which was...

362
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,722
we would build those. I'll go through each of these, by the way.

363
00:20:06,567 --> 00:20:08,868
Those were built using what we called canned animation,

364
00:20:08,868 --> 00:20:10,929
which is pre-authored animation.

365
00:20:10,929 --> 00:20:14,271
And I'll show you the huge time savings that we had

366
00:20:14,271 --> 00:20:15,291
because we used that system.

367
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:16,912
And then stance animations,

368
00:20:16,912 --> 00:20:19,234
which would include any kind of like a breathe,

369
00:20:19,234 --> 00:20:21,155
also locomotion, we considered stance animation.

370
00:20:21,155 --> 00:20:26,117
Let's talk a little bit about cut scenes and vignettes.

371
00:20:26,117 --> 00:20:27,438
So this was a 2D game.

372
00:20:27,438 --> 00:20:32,661
Everything was flat with the illusion of depth.

373
00:20:33,249 --> 00:20:36,876
And so what we did is, so with our camera we were very limited.

374
00:20:36,876 --> 00:20:40,402
So we thought of it as a stage, our scenes,

375
00:20:40,402 --> 00:20:43,106
we would try to think of it as a stage.

376
00:20:44,225 --> 00:20:47,046
but we had a stage with a camera, but it was a camera that couldn't be rotated.

377
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:49,847
So it could just be moved around like this.

378
00:20:49,847 --> 00:20:52,568
You know, we could rotate the camera like this,

379
00:20:52,568 --> 00:20:57,669
but we're not allowed to rotate the camera in this direction.

380
00:20:57,669 --> 00:21:01,690
And so, but that worked out great for the most part,

381
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:04,491
but it kind of started getting a little bit stale.

382
00:21:04,491 --> 00:21:09,613
So we started coming up with some ideas of how we could make the camera a little bit more dynamic.

383
00:21:10,104 --> 00:21:12,226
In this shot, I thought, you know what?

384
00:21:12,226 --> 00:21:13,647
It could use a POV shot.

385
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:14,248
So I gave it a try.

386
00:21:14,248 --> 00:21:15,729
This is the first time we tried it.

387
00:21:15,729 --> 00:21:17,690
If you watch.

388
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,852
I don't believe she'd leave something

389
00:21:19,852 --> 00:21:20,573
this dangerous lying around.

390
00:21:20,573 --> 00:21:21,213
What's that?

391
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:23,495
Nothing.

392
00:21:23,495 --> 00:21:30,341
So that was a simple POV shot,

393
00:21:30,341 --> 00:21:33,123
but it added some dynamics to the scene,

394
00:21:33,123 --> 00:21:35,365
and I thought that it called for it.

395
00:21:35,365 --> 00:21:36,886
And all you had to do was,

396
00:21:36,886 --> 00:21:37,787
you would just take Shay,

397
00:21:37,787 --> 00:21:39,728
and you just drag him out of the way.

398
00:21:40,023 --> 00:21:43,905
just below the camera, and then you just move the camera around in X, like that.

399
00:21:43,905 --> 00:21:50,346
And so it was a really simple solution, but I thought it added variety.

400
00:21:50,346 --> 00:21:50,866
So next...

401
00:21:50,866 --> 00:21:55,048
So our animators kept annoying Lee Petty.

402
00:21:55,048 --> 00:21:57,288
I always bring up Lee Petty, who's here in the front row.

403
00:21:58,931 --> 00:22:03,254
Because what we kept doing is we wanted to push the camera in on characters closely,

404
00:22:03,254 --> 00:22:06,095
you know, because we thought the shots would call for it.

405
00:22:06,095 --> 00:22:08,157
But what would happen is the backgrounds wouldn't hold up,

406
00:22:08,157 --> 00:22:10,598
so the resolution would start to fail.

407
00:22:10,598 --> 00:22:14,821
And so we came up with a solution of,

408
00:22:14,821 --> 00:22:18,743
well, why don't we just build cutouts, or why don't we paint cutouts?

409
00:22:19,342 --> 00:22:21,544
of those areas that we wanted to zoom in on

410
00:22:21,544 --> 00:22:22,524
and we would make them a higher resolution.

411
00:22:22,524 --> 00:22:24,046
We would just shove, have them pulled off to the side

412
00:22:24,046 --> 00:22:25,466
in the scene and then your camera could just

413
00:22:25,466 --> 00:22:26,607
in one frame cut over to those.

414
00:22:26,607 --> 00:22:27,408
So let me show you this scene.

415
00:22:27,408 --> 00:22:28,108
I can't see her anymore.

416
00:22:28,108 --> 00:22:29,209
Forget about the creature.

417
00:22:29,209 --> 00:22:30,870
We need to move you to a safe location.

418
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:31,451
Come with me.

419
00:22:55,967 --> 00:23:00,229
Okay, so you saw Shay in front of that red console, and you can see the small version

420
00:23:00,229 --> 00:23:05,592
of it there in the middle, kind of in the middle, in that middle scene.

421
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:09,775
And then you can see the high-res version of it off to the side.

422
00:23:10,748 --> 00:23:14,231
So this is actually what was happening. I just pulled the camera way back

423
00:23:14,231 --> 00:23:21,957
so you could see what was going on in the scene without the cameras.

424
00:23:21,957 --> 00:23:35,909
So Shay scaled up.

425
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:42,322
such a simple solution to a problem that we had.

426
00:23:42,322 --> 00:23:43,524
And so our characters are popping,

427
00:23:43,524 --> 00:23:45,346
they pop all over the place,

428
00:23:45,346 --> 00:23:47,027
especially if you look to the,

429
00:23:47,027 --> 00:23:49,070
on the other side you can see,

430
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:51,332
I wanted to do some reverse shots

431
00:23:51,332 --> 00:23:54,536
and so we'd build these extra little plates

432
00:23:54,536 --> 00:23:56,358
that you could put the characters in front of,

433
00:23:56,358 --> 00:23:56,938
just scaled up.

434
00:23:56,938 --> 00:23:59,801
And then the resolution held up for us.

435
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:06,761
We would generally do a three-stage animation process for our cutscenes.

436
00:24:06,761 --> 00:24:08,381
Most people are familiar with it.

437
00:24:08,381 --> 00:24:13,962
We do a layout pass, and then a blocking pass, and then a polish pass.

438
00:24:13,962 --> 00:24:18,463
I'll just give you a brief example.

439
00:24:18,463 --> 00:24:20,464
Hey, that's all we can do. We're pulling out.

440
00:24:20,464 --> 00:24:21,584
No! I need to save this last one.

441
00:24:21,584 --> 00:24:23,904
Don't make the same mistake you did last time, boy.

442
00:24:23,904 --> 00:24:25,625
You said you trusted my instinct, right?

443
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:28,826
I don't understand. What is it about this creature?

444
00:24:28,826 --> 00:24:30,686
I don't know, but it's important.

445
00:24:31,677 --> 00:24:35,699
And so when we got to this stage, we could have Tim Schafer, who was directing the game,

446
00:24:35,699 --> 00:24:40,041
and he wrote all the dialogue, he could watch these and give any feedback early on,

447
00:24:40,041 --> 00:24:45,884
and that way we wouldn't waste a bunch of time doing animation that he didn't actually want in the scene.

448
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:49,025
And then a blocking pass would look something like this.

449
00:24:49,025 --> 00:24:53,127
We're pulling out. No! I need to save this last one.

450
00:24:53,127 --> 00:24:56,709
Don't make the same mistake you did last time, boy.

451
00:24:56,709 --> 00:24:58,550
You said you trusted my instincts, right?

452
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:00,971
I don't understand. What is it about this creature?

453
00:25:01,726 --> 00:25:03,988
I don't know, but it's important.

454
00:25:03,988 --> 00:25:05,989
You see those white dots on the back of Shay's head?

455
00:25:05,989 --> 00:25:07,990
Those are actually his specular highlights.

456
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:09,211
They just didn't get turned off.

457
00:25:09,211 --> 00:25:12,273
That bothered Tim for two months.

458
00:25:12,273 --> 00:25:14,835
Every time we'd play the game, he'd see that.

459
00:25:14,835 --> 00:25:18,177
And he's like, when are you going to turn those off?

460
00:25:18,177 --> 00:25:20,399
And we're like, when we do polish, we'll turn them off.

461
00:25:20,399 --> 00:25:23,501
But just to bug him, we kept him there.

462
00:25:23,501 --> 00:25:26,263
And then final would be the polish pass.

463
00:25:26,263 --> 00:25:28,684
That's all we can do.

464
00:25:28,684 --> 00:25:29,905
We're pulling out.

465
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:34,324
No, I need to save this last one.

466
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:37,386
Don't make the same mistake you did last time, boy.

467
00:25:37,386 --> 00:25:39,147
You said you trusted my instincts, right?

468
00:25:39,147 --> 00:25:40,068
I don't understand.

469
00:25:40,068 --> 00:25:41,789
What is it about this creature?

470
00:25:41,789 --> 00:25:42,349
I don't know, but it's important.

471
00:25:42,349 --> 00:25:42,430
OK.

472
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:44,011
OK, next, scripted cut scenes.

473
00:25:44,011 --> 00:25:46,512
OK, so scripted cut scenes, I mentioned,

474
00:25:46,512 --> 00:25:51,576
we would use pre-authored talk animation

475
00:25:51,576 --> 00:25:55,578
and pre-authored gestures.

476
00:25:55,578 --> 00:25:57,740
We called it canned animation.

477
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:00,302
And we would then.

478
00:26:01,303 --> 00:26:03,524
put those together in what we call the cutscene editor.

479
00:26:03,524 --> 00:26:05,846
And I'll show you a little bit of that in just a minute.

480
00:26:05,846 --> 00:26:07,186
So this is just Shea.

481
00:26:07,186 --> 00:26:10,068
We generally do three talk animations.

482
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,748
I'm sorry I used the word animations.

483
00:26:11,748 --> 00:26:14,210
I know that bothers some people.

484
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:17,491
But we do a 40 frames, a 90 frames, and 130 frames,

485
00:26:17,491 --> 00:26:19,812
just so that we had variety,

486
00:26:19,812 --> 00:26:23,574
depending on how long the dialogue was.

487
00:26:23,574 --> 00:26:26,315
We didn't have a blending system,

488
00:26:26,315 --> 00:26:27,376
because the flipbooks,

489
00:26:27,376 --> 00:26:29,037
there was no way for us really to blend

490
00:26:29,037 --> 00:26:30,357
from one flipbook to another.

491
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:35,447
So we had to get creative so that characters wouldn't pop back into their default pose.

492
00:26:35,447 --> 00:26:37,567
But everything would return to their default pose.

493
00:26:37,567 --> 00:26:39,428
And then we'd do these gestures.

494
00:26:39,428 --> 00:26:42,329
A nod positive, a nod negative, shrugs, and points.

495
00:26:42,329 --> 00:26:47,470
Just on a side note, if you look at Shay,

496
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:48,790
when he was doing his nod,

497
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:53,192
this is... it looks pretty three-dimensional.

498
00:26:53,192 --> 00:26:54,872
But all we're doing actually is just...

499
00:26:55,290 --> 00:27:01,511
deforming the geometry with joints up and down, and it gives it that illusion that his head is actually

500
00:27:01,511 --> 00:27:05,673
nodding up and down. I just thought that was an interesting thing that I'd point out. This is a side note.

501
00:27:05,673 --> 00:27:07,693
Okay, so

502
00:27:07,693 --> 00:27:11,054
this is the cutscene editor.

503
00:27:11,054 --> 00:27:16,236
It's a custom-built tool that we have used

504
00:27:16,236 --> 00:27:21,077
since Psychonauts, actually, and Tim's Games

505
00:27:22,722 --> 00:27:25,404
have outrageous amounts of dialogue.

506
00:27:25,404 --> 00:27:29,448
This game actually had five hours.

507
00:27:29,448 --> 00:27:32,190
With Act 1 and 2, we're looking at five hours

508
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:33,050
of scripted cut scenes.

509
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:37,254
And those were all generated by one animator.

510
00:27:37,254 --> 00:27:40,356
So it's a pretty effective system,

511
00:27:40,356 --> 00:27:43,879
as long as you have the canned animation to work with.

512
00:27:43,879 --> 00:27:46,741
You can see that it has the characters who are in the scene.

513
00:27:46,741 --> 00:27:50,084
You have the girl, which is Vela, and then the tram priener.

514
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,743
and then it has the dialogue in there,

515
00:27:53,743 --> 00:27:57,907
it has the animation, each animation is in there

516
00:27:57,907 --> 00:27:59,109
that it's going to use.

517
00:27:59,109 --> 00:28:01,491
The cameras are actually not Maya cameras,

518
00:28:01,491 --> 00:28:02,792
you can see there's a camera track.

519
00:28:02,792 --> 00:28:05,756
Those are cameras that were set up in the game,

520
00:28:05,756 --> 00:28:08,118
and that the game sees each of those,

521
00:28:08,118 --> 00:28:10,300
and then it moves the camera to where it's supposed to be.

522
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:14,121
We weren't allowed to do panning cameras with scripted cutscenes.

523
00:28:14,121 --> 00:28:16,322
You just have to just pop to the different scenes.

524
00:28:16,322 --> 00:28:18,464
So you are limited by what you can do,

525
00:28:18,464 --> 00:28:20,105
but it sure saves a lot of time.

526
00:28:20,105 --> 00:28:21,386
Here's an example.

527
00:28:21,386 --> 00:28:23,907
We use these a lot for dialogue trees, actually,

528
00:28:23,907 --> 00:28:25,568
which Tim's games have a lot of.

529
00:28:25,568 --> 00:28:27,850
We have a sound.

530
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:28,010
Your name?

531
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:28,170
Well, yeah.

532
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:28,430
But my dad said,

533
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:29,711
hey, losing an A is better than losing an I.

534
00:28:39,777 --> 00:28:41,017
Your dad's pretty funny.

535
00:28:41,017 --> 00:28:44,159
He used to be, before he joined this cult.

536
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,661
Oh, whoops. Did I say that too loud?

537
00:28:46,661 --> 00:28:50,783
Hey, is there any way out of this cloud?

538
00:28:50,783 --> 00:28:52,885
Think I'd be here if there were?

539
00:28:52,885 --> 00:28:59,569
We used to have a cool feather bedder that went straight down to the forest below.

540
00:28:59,569 --> 00:29:01,890
But Harmony took it out.

541
00:29:03,894 --> 00:29:05,215
So it's pretty effective.

542
00:29:05,215 --> 00:29:07,436
I mean, it doesn't have as much fidelity

543
00:29:07,436 --> 00:29:10,739
as a fully animated cutscene might have,

544
00:29:10,739 --> 00:29:12,240
but it definitely does the job.

545
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,983
Okay, if you notice, there was lip sync during all those,

546
00:29:16,983 --> 00:29:21,586
and we did not have the time to animate all the lip sync.

547
00:29:21,586 --> 00:29:22,246
So let's see.

548
00:29:24,337 --> 00:29:29,202
So, Act 2 of Broken Age, we're looking at over 47,000 words.

549
00:29:29,202 --> 00:29:32,525
Most of those would have to get lip-sync.

550
00:29:32,525 --> 00:29:37,710
And we were a pretty small team, and there's no way that we could pull that off by ourselves.

551
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:43,215
So we use an auto-lip-sync tool, and it's a third-party tool by AnoSoft.

552
00:29:43,827 --> 00:29:45,168
It's very effective.

553
00:29:45,168 --> 00:29:47,890
What we would do for this game is

554
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:50,551
the 2D artist would give us a visem set.

555
00:29:50,551 --> 00:29:53,033
We would then take that, we would just map it onto a plane

556
00:29:53,033 --> 00:29:56,316
and put it onto the character, bind that to a joint.

557
00:29:56,316 --> 00:29:57,056
We would then use what we have,

558
00:29:57,056 --> 00:30:02,880
this is an internal tool called the animation toolbox.

559
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,923
And what this does is this lets us save poses out

560
00:30:06,923 --> 00:30:08,064
on specific joints.

561
00:30:08,064 --> 00:30:11,767
And in this case, it is a joint and a flip book.

562
00:30:13,034 --> 00:30:16,036
And so those are our phoneme sets that we've set up,

563
00:30:16,036 --> 00:30:19,978
which are just poses that are saved.

564
00:30:19,978 --> 00:30:24,860
We then take those phonemes and we match them up

565
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,421
with the software's phonemes.

566
00:30:26,421 --> 00:30:32,804
If you look, it's like the ah has A-E-ah, ah, A-W, and A-Y.

567
00:30:32,804 --> 00:30:33,805
Then.

568
00:30:35,978 --> 00:30:40,501
We take that and we open up our custom interface that we've built for the software

569
00:30:40,501 --> 00:30:44,223
and you can actually bring in the line codes from the dialog database

570
00:30:44,223 --> 00:30:50,528
and what it does is it looks at the line code and then it looks at the waveform

571
00:30:50,528 --> 00:30:54,430
and it also looks at the text

572
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:55,911
and it generates a

573
00:30:55,911 --> 00:30:57,552
it generates a Maya file

574
00:30:57,552 --> 00:31:02,536
and that Maya file, you can just actually open it up and make any changes if you need to

575
00:31:02,536 --> 00:31:05,618
but if you open it, all you see is the mouth just moving and talking.

576
00:31:07,294 --> 00:31:09,395
So here's an example of one that an animator hasn't touched.

577
00:31:09,395 --> 00:31:10,075
It's just out of the arcade.

578
00:31:10,075 --> 00:31:11,056
I beat my own high score on 3 Hyper Crit,

579
00:31:11,056 --> 00:31:21,623
and I was like, if I can do that, I can do anything!

580
00:31:21,623 --> 00:31:22,104
Right, so that's Gus.

581
00:31:22,104 --> 00:31:24,305
That's actually voiced by Pendleton Ward from Adventure

582
00:31:24,305 --> 00:31:26,287
Time, if you recognize the voice.

583
00:31:26,697 --> 00:31:29,499
If you want to know any more about our dialogue system,

584
00:31:29,499 --> 00:31:31,600
Anna Kipnis, our lead gameplay programmer,

585
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,481
is giving a talk this Friday.

586
00:31:33,481 --> 00:31:34,302
It's a really good talk.

587
00:31:34,302 --> 00:31:36,183
It's on our entire dialogue system,

588
00:31:36,183 --> 00:31:37,785
what we've been using for years.

589
00:31:37,785 --> 00:31:40,126
So if you have an interest in that, go see that talk.

590
00:31:40,126 --> 00:31:40,366
All right.

591
00:31:40,366 --> 00:31:42,528
Player locomotion.

592
00:31:42,528 --> 00:31:45,130
I'd mentioned stance animation, which

593
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:46,811
include player locomotion.

594
00:31:46,811 --> 00:31:48,452
Very important in this game.

595
00:31:48,452 --> 00:31:53,035
It's an adventure game, a lot of walking.

596
00:31:53,035 --> 00:31:53,636
Sorry about that.

597
00:31:54,706 --> 00:31:57,328
So we had west and east directions,

598
00:31:57,328 --> 00:32:00,230
and we had northeast and we had southwest.

599
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:02,551
We had northwest and southeast,

600
00:32:02,551 --> 00:32:04,453
and that's what we were gonna stick with.

601
00:32:04,453 --> 00:32:07,455
We ran some tests and played it a little bit

602
00:32:07,455 --> 00:32:10,037
and realized maybe it was a little annoying

603
00:32:10,037 --> 00:32:12,678
to make people always go at an angle.

604
00:32:12,678 --> 00:32:16,901
And so eventually we added north and south directions.

605
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:18,703
But every direction that we added,

606
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:20,524
we needed to author new animation for.

607
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:25,483
And not only did we need to author one speed of animation,

608
00:32:25,483 --> 00:32:28,925
we ended up having three speeds of animation in the game.

609
00:32:28,925 --> 00:32:30,306
So we had a walk.

610
00:32:30,306 --> 00:32:31,747
I'll show you.

611
00:32:31,747 --> 00:32:32,467
I'll show you an example.

612
00:32:32,467 --> 00:32:34,849
We had a walk, and we had a trot,

613
00:32:34,849 --> 00:32:36,369
and then we also had a run.

614
00:32:36,369 --> 00:32:37,970
And these are for our player characters.

615
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:39,251
We have two player characters.

616
00:32:39,251 --> 00:32:40,872
We have Vela, and we have Shay.

617
00:32:40,872 --> 00:32:47,576
So there were certain times we wanted to use walks.

618
00:32:47,576 --> 00:32:48,196
So here's an example.

619
00:32:48,196 --> 00:32:50,338
A confined space on the spaceship.

620
00:32:53,475 --> 00:32:54,376
he's walking around.

621
00:32:54,376 --> 00:32:56,637
We would not want the character to be running around in there.

622
00:32:56,637 --> 00:32:58,919
Probably not even want them trotting

623
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:01,060
because the area is so confined.

624
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:03,622
And so the programmer could just lock out

625
00:33:03,622 --> 00:33:05,123
the locomotion that they wanted to.

626
00:33:05,123 --> 00:33:07,564
And then to the opposite extreme,

627
00:33:07,564 --> 00:33:09,285
we have big hallways,

628
00:33:09,285 --> 00:33:11,567
which that's when we determined we needed to have some runs.

629
00:33:11,567 --> 00:33:13,888
And so there's Shay running back and forth

630
00:33:13,888 --> 00:33:15,029
because you didn't want the player

631
00:33:15,029 --> 00:33:18,531
to have to every time walk slowly through those corridors.

632
00:33:18,531 --> 00:33:21,613
They would get bored and maybe stop playing your game.

633
00:33:24,657 --> 00:33:27,599
What this shows is just, this is all Vela's anims,

634
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:31,621
right here, these are all of her walk anims put together.

635
00:33:31,621 --> 00:33:36,043
So we had eight directions, three speeds,

636
00:33:36,043 --> 00:33:39,025
and we needed to author 15 separate animations

637
00:33:39,025 --> 00:33:42,067
for locomotion for the player character,

638
00:33:42,067 --> 00:33:43,487
for her and then for Shay.

639
00:33:43,487 --> 00:33:45,669
And then for north and north, or sorry,

640
00:33:45,669 --> 00:33:47,870
west and northwest and southwest,

641
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:50,731
we could just actually mirror them in the game engine,

642
00:33:50,731 --> 00:33:52,292
so we didn't have to author those.

643
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,181
All right.

644
00:34:30,181 --> 00:34:34,625
Perspective scaling, that's perspective scaling to the extreme.

645
00:34:34,625 --> 00:34:40,791
It was something that was very important in Broken Age.

646
00:34:40,791 --> 00:34:44,134
So as the character goes back in the distance,

647
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:49,860
they scale down and it appears that they actually are moving much more slowly.

648
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:53,741
And that was really important in this game because we didn't actually have real depth.

649
00:34:53,741 --> 00:34:57,101
We were faking it. We were faking it by scaling the character down,

650
00:34:57,101 --> 00:34:58,922
but not only scaling the character down,

651
00:34:58,922 --> 00:35:01,662
we need to scale the speed down of the character as well.

652
00:35:01,662 --> 00:35:05,783
So, let me show you an example of

653
00:35:05,783 --> 00:35:10,604
the game with perspective scaling on.

654
00:35:11,573 --> 00:35:14,975
but perspective, but root scaling not turned on.

655
00:35:14,975 --> 00:35:17,176
You can see how quickly she moves.

656
00:35:17,176 --> 00:35:20,218
So she's actually moving at the authored speed

657
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:22,159
that the animator authored her at.

658
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:26,862
But when she scales down,

659
00:35:26,862 --> 00:35:29,724
it looks like it appears that she's moving much faster.

660
00:35:29,724 --> 00:35:35,548
And so the solution is root motion scaling.

661
00:35:35,548 --> 00:35:37,209
So you'll see here.

662
00:35:40,298 --> 00:35:44,442
This is feeling much better than it did before.

663
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:48,406
Feels like she's set back in perspective.

664
00:35:48,406 --> 00:35:53,010
But I wasn't 100% convinced by it.

665
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:59,436
I thought that it could be improved, and so I started doing some tests.

666
00:35:59,436 --> 00:36:00,037
I did this test.

667
00:36:01,135 --> 00:36:06,239
of Vela, just in Maya, this is on one of the scenes on the beach,

668
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:08,341
of Vela walking on the beach.

669
00:36:08,341 --> 00:36:12,545
And so I had felt that before the spacing was wrong

670
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:15,047
when she was back in the distance.

671
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:19,371
And so I ran this test and I got it looking to where I was pretty happy with it,

672
00:36:19,371 --> 00:36:25,077
and then I took it over to, I showed it to Anna Kipnis, who is our lead gameplay programmer,

673
00:36:25,077 --> 00:36:26,178
and I also sent her...

674
00:36:26,833 --> 00:36:31,054
images of the curves so that she could see how the curves were.

675
00:36:31,054 --> 00:36:33,795
You know, it's sort of very gradual and then it speeds up.

676
00:36:33,795 --> 00:36:35,916
And then not only that, in this game,

677
00:36:35,916 --> 00:36:40,878
this is the curve of the scale of Vela.

678
00:36:40,878 --> 00:36:45,200
And so we had a global scale node that would allow the animators

679
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:49,321
to scale the entire character up or down

680
00:36:49,321 --> 00:36:54,163
because we were using perspective scaling and forced perspective.

681
00:36:56,842 --> 00:37:01,484
So here it is. It's a little subtle, but I think you'll see the difference.

682
00:37:01,484 --> 00:37:08,126
This is it with the new perspective, the root scaling that Anna set up.

683
00:37:08,126 --> 00:37:22,271
I just felt like it gave it much more depth than it did before.

684
00:37:28,926 --> 00:37:30,526
Okay.

685
00:37:30,526 --> 00:37:33,547
So, we're getting near the shipping,

686
00:37:33,547 --> 00:37:35,308
the first act of Broken Age.

687
00:37:35,308 --> 00:37:37,288
We were running the game.

688
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:38,869
It could run at 60 frames per second.

689
00:37:38,869 --> 00:37:40,469
Cut scenes were running at 30 frames per second

690
00:37:40,469 --> 00:37:41,990
because they were authored in Maya,

691
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:44,370
but the game could go up to 60 frames per second

692
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:46,171
during just, when you're just walking around.

693
00:37:46,171 --> 00:37:51,852
And one day I came in and Oliver Fronsky,

694
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:53,733
he's our lead programmer,

695
00:37:53,733 --> 00:37:56,274
he was messing around with this pixelized,

696
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,714
pixelated version of the game.

697
00:37:59,793 --> 00:38:03,555
And when I saw this, I was pretty intrigued,

698
00:38:03,555 --> 00:38:07,396
and I actually saw a cut scene play,

699
00:38:07,396 --> 00:38:10,697
and I felt like everything felt cohesive suddenly.

700
00:38:10,697 --> 00:38:12,497
And so we started talking about it,

701
00:38:12,497 --> 00:38:15,358
and what we realized is that the flip books

702
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:18,499
were clashing a little bit with the game,

703
00:38:18,499 --> 00:38:19,640
when it's with the character

704
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,580
and with the joint-driven animation.

705
00:38:22,096 --> 00:38:26,578
because you had one thing just, you know, that was such a stark change

706
00:38:26,578 --> 00:38:30,199
and then you had the joints that were, you know, look like they were being interpolated by the

707
00:38:30,199 --> 00:38:32,360
by the computer at 30 to 60 frames per second.

708
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:36,202
So this is what it looked like.

709
00:38:36,202 --> 00:38:38,283
This is probably running close to 60 frames per second.

710
00:38:38,283 --> 00:38:44,225
Like it looks cool, looks really smooth

711
00:38:44,225 --> 00:38:46,006
but it doesn't look, um...

712
00:38:47,482 --> 00:38:50,763
very hand done. It doesn't look like hands touched it, I felt.

713
00:38:50,763 --> 00:38:58,746
And so what we did is we re-sampled the animation

714
00:38:58,746 --> 00:39:00,327
down to 15 frames per second.

715
00:39:00,327 --> 00:39:06,749
Can you see the difference?

716
00:39:06,749 --> 00:39:10,210
This ended up working a lot better, I felt, especially in the cut scenes

717
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:12,691
when the flipbooks would turn on and off.

718
00:39:12,691 --> 00:39:16,052
There wasn't such a stark contrast between the joint-driven

719
00:39:16,699 --> 00:39:22,523
geometry and then the flipbook driven geometry.

720
00:39:22,523 --> 00:39:24,084
So it's a subtle change.

721
00:39:24,084 --> 00:39:26,045
It was actually somewhat controversial.

722
00:39:26,045 --> 00:39:26,986
Some people didn't want to do it

723
00:39:26,986 --> 00:39:28,947
and some of us wanted to do it.

724
00:39:28,947 --> 00:39:32,930
But we ultimately won and we went with this.

725
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:36,392
So we thought we were golden at this point.

726
00:39:36,392 --> 00:39:41,976
But then we watched one of our cut scenes play,

727
00:39:41,976 --> 00:39:42,776
which is this one.

728
00:39:46,623 --> 00:39:48,044
Let's see what we ended up with.

729
00:39:48,044 --> 00:39:48,164
That.

730
00:39:48,164 --> 00:39:52,987
That's what we ended up with.

731
00:39:52,987 --> 00:39:57,509
And so my hopes were somewhat dashed for a moment

732
00:39:57,509 --> 00:40:00,471
that we weren't going to get to resample to 15 frames

733
00:40:00,471 --> 00:40:02,012
per second because of that.

734
00:40:02,012 --> 00:40:03,433
And what's happening is.

735
00:40:04,578 --> 00:40:08,639
The character's animation is resampled down to 15 frames per second,

736
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:10,019
but the camera is not.

737
00:40:10,019 --> 00:40:13,340
So the camera is still running, in this case, at 30 frames per second.

738
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:15,801
This is an old animation problem.

739
00:40:15,801 --> 00:40:19,842
If you had a background plate that was moving on 1s,

740
00:40:19,842 --> 00:40:24,283
but if you had your actual animated character on 2s,

741
00:40:24,283 --> 00:40:26,104
you'd get this horrible strobing effect.

742
00:40:26,104 --> 00:40:32,045
And so what Oliver did is he went in and he set...

743
00:40:33,184 --> 00:40:40,626
he set it up so that the character's root motion would actually move at 30 frames per second

744
00:40:40,626 --> 00:40:46,868
or 60 frames per second, whether it was a cutscene, it was 30, if it was in-game, it was 60.

745
00:40:46,868 --> 00:40:49,288
So the root motion actually would not resample.

746
00:40:49,288 --> 00:40:50,188
And that works.

747
00:40:50,188 --> 00:40:52,389
This is what we get when that happens.

748
00:40:59,228 --> 00:41:01,230
So then it's nice and smooth.

749
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:05,673
So the character's actually moving at 30,

750
00:41:05,673 --> 00:41:08,615
but all of her limbs and everything

751
00:41:08,615 --> 00:41:10,517
are actually animating at 15 frames per second.

752
00:41:10,517 --> 00:41:15,600
And that was a great solution for us.

753
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:20,464
Okay, so one of our biggest headaches on this project.

754
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,611
we had no Z depth buffer.

755
00:41:22,611 --> 00:41:25,393
And the reason we didn't have the Z depth buffer is we,

756
00:41:25,393 --> 00:41:27,794
one of the big reasons is we needed the memory

757
00:41:27,794 --> 00:41:32,717
for transparency, we needed it for the transparent textures.

758
00:41:32,717 --> 00:41:35,118
And everything is pretty much a painting in this game,

759
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:39,040
and we needed as much memory for that as we could have,

760
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,362
and so we chose to drop the Z depth buffer.

761
00:41:42,362 --> 00:41:45,003
That caused a lot of animation bugs,

762
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:48,225
because the engine didn't know how to sort

763
00:41:49,022 --> 00:41:51,984
all the different planes that we had created,

764
00:41:51,984 --> 00:41:56,868
if you rotated them at all, other than what we call the Z,

765
00:41:56,868 --> 00:41:58,809
which is the Z rotation like this.

766
00:41:58,809 --> 00:42:01,331
If you rotate them at all towards the camera,

767
00:42:01,331 --> 00:42:03,453
everything would just blow up.

768
00:42:03,453 --> 00:42:07,376
We had a couple of animators that were having a hard time with this,

769
00:42:07,376 --> 00:42:07,676
because...

770
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:12,455
When you're working in Maya, we're actually using a 3D camera,

771
00:42:12,455 --> 00:42:14,596
and you'd turn the camera, and it looked fine.

772
00:42:14,596 --> 00:42:15,997
There wasn't any problem.

773
00:42:15,997 --> 00:42:18,459
You could even turn the head a little bit on the character,

774
00:42:18,459 --> 00:42:19,320
and it would still hold up.

775
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,541
But this is the result that you would get.

776
00:42:20,541 --> 00:42:21,541
OK, that's enough.

777
00:42:21,541 --> 00:42:22,562
What do you mean, that's enough?

778
00:42:22,562 --> 00:42:23,282
Tiny enemy ships are approaching.

779
00:42:23,282 --> 00:42:24,003
I don't see anything.

780
00:42:24,003 --> 00:42:28,366
I need to save this last one.

781
00:42:28,366 --> 00:42:37,212
You're going to endanger the whole mission to save one creature?

782
00:42:37,212 --> 00:42:37,953
Just give me a second.

783
00:42:40,377 --> 00:42:43,699
So you can see, we ended up with lots of bugs.

784
00:42:43,699 --> 00:42:45,880
Most of our bugs in the first act

785
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:49,901
was because animators thought that they could rotate things

786
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:51,662
however they wanted to.

787
00:42:51,662 --> 00:42:54,664
But that's the result that you would get.

788
00:42:54,664 --> 00:42:59,046
Even just a little bit, it would just explode like that.

789
00:43:01,057 --> 00:43:05,240
If you want to know a little bit more about that, Oliver Fronsky, his website, he actually

790
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:09,623
has some papers about it, and you can go and find out more technical details about that

791
00:43:09,623 --> 00:43:10,283
system.

792
00:43:10,283 --> 00:43:14,566
You might find that interesting if you're a TD or a programmer.

793
00:43:14,566 --> 00:43:19,510
Okay, so what we learned from this hybrid approach...

794
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:24,552
to mold your pipeline to your current tool set.

795
00:43:24,552 --> 00:43:26,353
We found that that was very important.

796
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:27,493
We knew how to use our tools.

797
00:43:27,493 --> 00:43:30,275
Our animators knew how to use the tools.

798
00:43:30,275 --> 00:43:33,717
And so why start over if you don't have to?

799
00:43:33,717 --> 00:43:35,438
We got huge performance advantages

800
00:43:35,438 --> 00:43:40,560
from using joint deformation versus sprite sheets.

801
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,742
It was a really easy ramp up for 3D animators,

802
00:43:43,742 --> 00:43:45,963
except for the rotating the limbs

803
00:43:45,963 --> 00:43:47,604
the way they weren't supposed to.

804
00:43:47,604 --> 00:43:48,925
That was the only exception to that.

805
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:58,572
Joint-driven deformation, it really allowed the fidelity that we wanted in this game and that made Tim happy.

806
00:43:58,572 --> 00:44:02,454
The 15 frames per second, we felt that that blended really well with the flipbooks.

807
00:44:02,454 --> 00:44:06,196
It was kind of a last-minute decision, but we went for it, and I'm glad that we did.

808
00:44:06,196 --> 00:44:12,540
The scripted cutscenes, it will save thousands of animation hours.

809
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:17,663
It truly did save us, and it's what allowed us to make this game and to complete this game.

810
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:25,754
And also I do need to mention we had an outsourcing team up in Oregon, in Portland, called Super Genius.

811
00:44:25,754 --> 00:44:29,676
And Alex Yao and his team did an amazing job for us.

812
00:44:29,676 --> 00:44:37,080
So we worked in tandem with them to finish this first act and the second act that we're almost done with.

813
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:40,702
So some problems, additional flip books, you know, whenever you'd need a different flip book.

814
00:44:40,702 --> 00:44:41,963
Like if you needed a new hand.

815
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:45,131
you had a point, but maybe you wanted some horns,

816
00:44:45,131 --> 00:44:50,235
you would have to suggest, you'd have to ask a painter if they

817
00:44:50,235 --> 00:44:51,716
could do that for you.

818
00:44:51,716 --> 00:44:53,337
They would then paint it up.

819
00:44:53,337 --> 00:44:59,901
We would then have to have a TD apply that to a geometric plane

820
00:44:59,901 --> 00:45:01,302
and put it onto the character.

821
00:45:01,302 --> 00:45:04,223
So that was a little bit of a problem, but not too bad

822
00:45:04,223 --> 00:45:05,284
if you're communicating well.

823
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:10,579
And then using transparent objects required us to lose the Z-buffer, and that was

824
00:45:10,579 --> 00:45:16,041
probably our biggest problem as far as animation goes, but we worked around it.

825
00:45:16,041 --> 00:45:17,841
Really quickly, Shea memory totals.

826
00:45:17,841 --> 00:45:24,784
These are from our lead programmer. He shared these with me. This is for Shea in Act 1.

827
00:45:24,784 --> 00:45:27,345
So the rig plus all the animation.

828
00:45:28,632 --> 00:45:31,293
you're looking at 10.7 megabytes for the animation.

829
00:45:31,293 --> 00:45:32,454
The rig is only 170 KB.

830
00:45:32,454 --> 00:45:36,196
And then with the textures, the chase textures,

831
00:45:36,196 --> 00:45:36,516
25.3 megabytes.

832
00:45:36,516 --> 00:45:39,837
And I think that includes all of his outfits.

833
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:42,799
He actually has multiple outfits.

834
00:45:42,799 --> 00:45:45,440
So that's only 36 megabytes for the memory.

835
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:51,244
And then if we'd gone with the sprite sheets,

836
00:45:51,244 --> 00:45:55,946
which I initially was thinking about,

837
00:45:55,946 --> 00:45:58,207
we're looking at 15 frames per second.

838
00:45:58,763 --> 00:46:05,208
You're looking at 7.4 gigs, and so it's just a huge difference.

839
00:46:05,208 --> 00:46:07,510
So it was a big savings for us as far as memory.

840
00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:14,917
All right. Questions? I think we have some time. Pretty sure.

841
00:46:14,917 --> 00:46:19,621
Maybe we have more time than I want. How are we doing?

842
00:46:19,621 --> 00:46:19,841
Yeah.

843
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:34,325
Anybody have some questions?

844
00:46:34,325 --> 00:46:36,687
Yeah, hi. Thanks for a great talk.

845
00:46:36,687 --> 00:46:41,172
I was just wondering, how did you solve the C-buffer depth bug?

846
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:43,330
Did you work around it or did you come up with a solution?

847
00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:44,090
We worked around it.

848
00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:45,431
So basically what we'd have to do,

849
00:46:45,431 --> 00:46:47,611
we ended up writing a script which

850
00:46:47,611 --> 00:46:49,052
you could, if you had the animation open,

851
00:46:49,052 --> 00:46:50,112
you could just click on it.

852
00:46:50,112 --> 00:46:53,893
What it'd do is it'd remove any rotation that was unwanted.

853
00:46:53,893 --> 00:46:56,894
And that would just go through the entire whatever,

854
00:46:56,894 --> 00:46:57,994
if it was a cut scene, it would just

855
00:46:57,994 --> 00:47:00,715
go through the entire cut scene and remove any, for us,

856
00:47:00,715 --> 00:47:03,815
it was any x or any y rotation that the character had.

857
00:47:03,815 --> 00:47:07,556
And that generally fixed it, the problem for us.

858
00:47:07,556 --> 00:47:08,317
All right, thanks.

859
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:15,228
Hey, so you were talking about the matching the phoneme data with the mouth animations.

860
00:47:15,228 --> 00:47:20,355
I was wondering, I think you might have mentioned it, did you do that before you implemented

861
00:47:20,355 --> 00:47:21,818
it into the game or was that at runtime?

862
00:47:21,818 --> 00:47:25,643
So matching the phoneme data with...

863
00:47:25,643 --> 00:47:26,324
Oh, okay.

864
00:47:26,324 --> 00:47:26,465
So...

865
00:47:27,214 --> 00:47:29,695
What we do, I think this will answer your question,

866
00:47:29,695 --> 00:47:32,035
we would actually generate that beforehand,

867
00:47:32,035 --> 00:47:34,115
and that would actually create a Maya file.

868
00:47:34,115 --> 00:47:36,596
Then those Maya files, we'd export out to the game.

869
00:47:36,596 --> 00:47:39,856
And then it would play a priority animation

870
00:47:39,856 --> 00:47:42,497
just on the mouth, like a mouth joint.

871
00:47:42,497 --> 00:47:44,717
So that's why the rest of the body could move,

872
00:47:44,717 --> 00:47:47,478
and it would just play this priority animation

873
00:47:47,478 --> 00:47:48,198
on the mouth joint.

874
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:49,998
Does that answer the question?

875
00:47:49,998 --> 00:47:50,118
Yeah.

876
00:47:50,118 --> 00:47:52,559
Okay, great.

877
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:54,639
Any other questions?

878
00:47:54,639 --> 00:47:54,979
That it?

879
00:47:55,825 --> 00:48:01,249
If you have any other questions, I can stick around since we have a little bit of time.

880
00:48:01,249 --> 00:48:04,071
You can come up or you can you could always shoot me an email.

881
00:48:04,071 --> 00:48:05,472
I'd be happy to to answer them for you.

882
00:48:05,472 --> 00:48:08,014
So I think that's it. Thanks for coming, you guys.

883
00:48:08,014 --> 00:48:08,915
I really appreciate it.
