1
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:07,912
Hey everyone, thanks so much for coming.

2
00:00:07,912 --> 00:00:09,514
It's great to see you all here today.

3
00:00:09,514 --> 00:00:10,515
Happy first day of GDC.

4
00:00:10,515 --> 00:00:12,417
How's everyone holding up so far?

5
00:00:12,417 --> 00:00:14,059
Pacing ourselves?

6
00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:16,401
Excellent.

7
00:00:16,401 --> 00:00:17,442
Well, welcome.

8
00:00:17,442 --> 00:00:19,964
It's great to see you all here today.

9
00:00:19,964 --> 00:00:21,826
By the way, I can barely see anybody in the audience

10
00:00:21,826 --> 00:00:24,709
because the lights are super bright.

11
00:00:24,709 --> 00:00:27,172
But let's talk about contracting.

12
00:00:27,172 --> 00:00:28,733
And before we do that though,

13
00:00:29,033 --> 00:00:33,756
I just want to acknowledge that probably most of you are sitting out there thinking,

14
00:00:33,756 --> 00:00:35,997
I really wish I could be in some other session than this one,

15
00:00:35,997 --> 00:00:39,439
because let's just acknowledge how much of it sucks that we're talking about

16
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:41,460
contracting in the indie track of GDC.

17
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,321
Because in an ideal world,

18
00:00:43,321 --> 00:00:45,422
we'd be making the games that we want to make,

19
00:00:45,422 --> 00:00:47,443
charging a fair amount for our work,

20
00:00:47,443 --> 00:00:50,425
and earning a decent living doing the work that we love to do.

21
00:00:50,907 --> 00:00:53,487
I don't think anyone would dispute that that's the ideal,

22
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:55,828
but unfortunately this right here

23
00:00:55,828 --> 00:00:58,388
is our far less than ideal reality.

24
00:00:58,388 --> 00:01:00,669
That is the deep, dark, truthful mirror

25
00:01:00,669 --> 00:01:02,389
of tweets right there.

26
00:01:02,389 --> 00:01:05,309
So yeah, as we all know,

27
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:06,790
sometimes the road to success

28
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:09,930
is not quite as straightforward as we might like.

29
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,071
And when that happens,

30
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,911
sometimes you just gotta do what you gotta do

31
00:01:12,911 --> 00:01:13,771
to keep your team together

32
00:01:13,771 --> 00:01:15,271
so you can live to fight another day.

33
00:01:16,389 --> 00:01:18,650
And contracting is a great way to do that.

34
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,251
But it definitely helps to know what you're doing,

35
00:01:20,251 --> 00:01:22,773
so that's what we're gonna talk about.

36
00:01:22,773 --> 00:01:26,795
And hey, by the way, I'm Amy Dallas.

37
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,056
Hi.

38
00:01:28,056 --> 00:01:30,518
And I run Clutch Play Games out of Portland, Oregon,

39
00:01:30,518 --> 00:01:33,400
and my company just turned seven last month,

40
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,360
which kind of blows my mind.

41
00:01:34,778 --> 00:01:35,559
Thank you.

42
00:01:35,559 --> 00:01:38,643
Only a room full of Indies can appreciate

43
00:01:38,643 --> 00:01:41,026
what a huge accomplishment that is.

44
00:01:41,026 --> 00:01:43,729
And I don't think, if I'm going to keep it real,

45
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:46,672
I don't think that would've been possible without contracting,

46
00:01:46,672 --> 00:01:47,793
to be perfectly honest.

47
00:01:48,885 --> 00:01:50,867
And I think our story started out like,

48
00:01:50,867 --> 00:01:53,069
we're like a lot of teams out there, I think.

49
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:56,452
We were once part of a corporate studio system,

50
00:01:56,452 --> 00:01:58,194
and the satellite office where we worked

51
00:01:58,194 --> 00:02:00,456
got totally downsized out of existence,

52
00:02:00,456 --> 00:02:01,837
and we happened to live in a place

53
00:02:01,837 --> 00:02:05,101
where that was literally the only paying game job

54
00:02:05,101 --> 00:02:06,802
anywhere near where we lived.

55
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,791
So we didn't really feel like we had a lot of options

56
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:11,311
because we didn't want to leave games.

57
00:02:11,311 --> 00:02:14,393
So four of us got together, and we went all in on being indie.

58
00:02:14,393 --> 00:02:17,994
And so we worked for 10 months without a paycheck, which

59
00:02:17,994 --> 00:02:19,795
I fully don't recommend, by the way.

60
00:02:19,795 --> 00:02:23,316
And so when we got to the end of the development

61
00:02:23,316 --> 00:02:24,997
cycle on that first game, we were so relieved.

62
00:02:24,997 --> 00:02:26,478
We were like, oh, thank god.

63
00:02:26,478 --> 00:02:29,939
We are so ready to make some money.

64
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:31,220
So we put our game out there.

65
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,140
We were super excited.

66
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,601
We were full of new indie optimism.

67
00:02:34,601 --> 00:02:35,742
And guess what we found out?

68
00:02:36,753 --> 00:02:38,593
Man in co-working space.

69
00:02:38,593 --> 00:02:40,194
Dude knows what he's talking about,

70
00:02:40,194 --> 00:02:43,074
because that time around, the risk just did not pay off

71
00:02:43,074 --> 00:02:45,135
for us, not at all.

72
00:02:45,135 --> 00:02:48,256
And thus began our journey into contracting.

73
00:02:48,256 --> 00:02:53,137
And I think when we started out, our goals were really simple.

74
00:02:53,137 --> 00:02:55,557
We just wanted to maybe pick up one or two gigs,

75
00:02:55,557 --> 00:02:58,758
earn just enough money to fund the development

76
00:02:58,758 --> 00:03:00,658
of another game, and then hopefully,

77
00:03:00,658 --> 00:03:03,359
if we learned from our mistakes and we did a little better,

78
00:03:03,359 --> 00:03:05,159
we could go back to just being a full-time

79
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:06,080
indie development team.

80
00:03:07,148 --> 00:03:08,968
And that's almost what happened.

81
00:03:08,968 --> 00:03:11,769
So we were pretty fortunate our first time out.

82
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:12,890
We had a pretty good client.

83
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,570
They paid us pretty well.

84
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:17,331
And it took us about 10 months to earn enough money

85
00:03:17,331 --> 00:03:19,732
to start our second game, Skullduggery.

86
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:21,752
And we did actually learn from our mistakes.

87
00:03:21,752 --> 00:03:23,293
We did a lot better on that game.

88
00:03:23,293 --> 00:03:26,234
And we certainly earned enough to jump back in and work

89
00:03:26,234 --> 00:03:28,275
on more indie games right away.

90
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:31,175
And yet when the time came, we kind of surprised ourselves

91
00:03:31,175 --> 00:03:33,076
by deciding that we would go back and take

92
00:03:33,076 --> 00:03:34,677
on some more contracting work.

93
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,661
And at the time, we made that decision

94
00:03:37,661 --> 00:03:39,403
because we had some clients that we really

95
00:03:39,403 --> 00:03:41,666
liked who were reaching out to us and asking us for help.

96
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:44,649
But also, we kind of recognized that we ended up

97
00:03:44,649 --> 00:03:47,092
liking it a whole lot more than we expected to,

98
00:03:47,092 --> 00:03:49,175
which was a surprise to us.

99
00:03:49,175 --> 00:03:52,519
As far as we're concerned, we get to solve really hard,

100
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:55,623
interesting problems for people that we really like.

101
00:03:56,344 --> 00:03:58,544
And also it gives us some predictability of income,

102
00:03:58,544 --> 00:04:01,025
which as we all know as indies is a good thing.

103
00:04:01,025 --> 00:04:03,746
And it's also allowed us to hire more people

104
00:04:03,746 --> 00:04:06,167
and pay them fairly to do work that they love to do.

105
00:04:06,167 --> 00:04:08,288
So it's actually been pretty good for us.

106
00:04:08,288 --> 00:04:11,409
But I will say as the studio head, in the beginning,

107
00:04:11,409 --> 00:04:13,150
it was super stressful.

108
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,890
Because I suddenly realized, man,

109
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,371
I don't think I know everything I

110
00:04:16,371 --> 00:04:18,612
need to know to make sure we're successful as we

111
00:04:18,612 --> 00:04:19,892
take on this kind of work.

112
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:26,308
So I better go do my due diligence and go out and see what other people think who are

113
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:28,390
experienced in contracting in games.

114
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:34,956
And so I did that, and I basically went to all these different teams I knew and said,

115
00:04:34,956 --> 00:04:37,458
tell me what I need to know about contracting in games.

116
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:41,842
And pretty much the messages that I got overwhelmingly was that it sucked.

117
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:48,306
I heard it over and over again, all the same reasons that you all hear all the time, right?

118
00:04:48,306 --> 00:04:52,851
It's the, it's the Indy mantra that as Indies we have no power.

119
00:04:52,851 --> 00:04:57,896
When you're negotiating with a big company, you know, they're the ones who have the power

120
00:04:57,896 --> 00:04:59,698
and you don't, so there's no room to negotiate.

121
00:05:01,159 --> 00:05:04,721
It's hard to get people to pay you fairly because why would they pay an indie team fairly

122
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:09,945
when they can actually pay an overseas team pennies on the dollar to do the same work.

123
00:05:09,945 --> 00:05:10,786
That's the thing.

124
00:05:10,786 --> 00:05:12,567
I just was talking to someone about that the other day.

125
00:05:12,567 --> 00:05:14,768
That's still a thing that people worry about a lot.

126
00:05:15,554 --> 00:05:19,377
And when I asked some specific questions about how people

127
00:05:19,377 --> 00:05:22,359
structured their projects, like, how do you do it?

128
00:05:22,359 --> 00:05:25,221
Do you do it as a time and materials project or a fixed

129
00:05:25,221 --> 00:05:28,123
bid, I heard overwhelmingly from every single person I

130
00:05:28,123 --> 00:05:30,946
talked to that there was only one way to do these kinds of

131
00:05:30,946 --> 00:05:33,487
projects, and that was as a fixed bid.

132
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:38,118
And the reasons given, it was basically all the same reasons

133
00:05:38,118 --> 00:05:42,000
that people were saying that these kinds of projects suck.

134
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,881
Because again, it goes back to the idea

135
00:05:43,881 --> 00:05:45,281
that the clients have all the power.

136
00:05:45,281 --> 00:05:48,903
And a fixed bid model tends to be a little better for them,

137
00:05:48,903 --> 00:05:49,163
right?

138
00:05:49,163 --> 00:05:50,924
Because they know what they're going

139
00:05:50,924 --> 00:05:52,045
to get, when they're going to get it,

140
00:05:52,045 --> 00:05:53,466
and how much it's going to cost.

141
00:05:53,466 --> 00:05:56,427
And if you, as the developer, underbid the project,

142
00:05:56,427 --> 00:05:57,468
you're going to end up probably having

143
00:05:57,468 --> 00:06:00,209
to do a little bit of extra work without the extra pay.

144
00:06:01,252 --> 00:06:05,656
So upon hearing all this, I'm like, wow, you're right,

145
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,618
everybody, this does sound like it sucks.

146
00:06:07,618 --> 00:06:08,459
This sounds terrible.

147
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:10,380
Why would anyone want to do this?

148
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,682
But at that point, again, I didn't have a lot of choices.

149
00:06:12,682 --> 00:06:15,225
We needed to make sure we got some money in the door.

150
00:06:15,225 --> 00:06:19,448
So rather than taking all the kind of negativity on board,

151
00:06:19,448 --> 00:06:21,630
I kind of recognized that I had a choice to make.

152
00:06:22,881 --> 00:06:28,083
I could either accept everything I was being told as the truth and just brace myself for

153
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:33,285
my team and I to have a terrible experience, or I could focus my energies on trying to

154
00:06:33,285 --> 00:06:37,786
prove that it's possible to have a better experience taking on work for hire projects

155
00:06:37,786 --> 00:06:38,286
as an Indie.

156
00:06:38,286 --> 00:06:41,968
And I think I've actually accomplished that over time.

157
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:46,589
I've never felt like I couldn't negotiate with a client as long as I was clear about

158
00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:49,710
what I wanted and what I was willing to give up to get it.

159
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:54,954
I've never felt like a client wouldn't pay us fairly.

160
00:06:54,954 --> 00:06:56,075
I have to work for it.

161
00:06:56,075 --> 00:06:59,278
I have to push for getting the best rate I can.

162
00:06:59,278 --> 00:07:01,179
But I never felt like someone was like,

163
00:07:01,179 --> 00:07:05,083
you're just not worth that money.

164
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:08,346
And I never felt like I couldn't sell a client

165
00:07:08,346 --> 00:07:10,388
on a particular type of project,

166
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,350
as long as I was clear about how it was

167
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:14,732
in their best interest also, as well as mine.

168
00:07:16,694 --> 00:07:19,415
So that didn't happen by accident.

169
00:07:19,415 --> 00:07:23,517
That happened by staying really focused on what was important.

170
00:07:23,517 --> 00:07:27,659
And this is kind of how I maintain that level of focus.

171
00:07:27,659 --> 00:07:30,341
All I cared about as we were starting out was who we were,

172
00:07:30,341 --> 00:07:35,503
what we wanted, what was possible for us, and what tools

173
00:07:35,503 --> 00:07:37,864
and structures I needed to put in place to make sure we were

174
00:07:37,864 --> 00:07:39,465
successful.

175
00:07:39,465 --> 00:07:42,747
So let's start off by talking about the first item, which is

176
00:07:42,747 --> 00:07:43,727
the who you are part.

177
00:07:47,135 --> 00:07:50,160
Sorry, I totally turn into Marco Rubio when I'm giving a talk.

178
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,823
I just get the huge dry mouth.

179
00:07:51,823 --> 00:07:52,664
So apologies.

180
00:07:52,664 --> 00:07:57,673
I'm going to be drinking some water today.

181
00:07:57,673 --> 00:07:57,753
So OK.

182
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:02,471
Defining your identity, I imagine a lot of you

183
00:08:02,471 --> 00:08:05,152
are probably sitting there thinking,

184
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:06,113
I can probably skip this part.

185
00:08:06,113 --> 00:08:07,434
We know who our team is.

186
00:08:07,434 --> 00:08:08,154
We know who we are.

187
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,375
We've worked together for a long time.

188
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:13,077
And if you're tempted to think that that's the case,

189
00:08:13,077 --> 00:08:15,298
I just wanna offer you this one

190
00:08:15,298 --> 00:08:17,740
potentially kind of gross sounding piece of advice,

191
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,381
and it is gross sounding, but it's true.

192
00:08:20,181 --> 00:08:20,862
And that is this.

193
00:08:20,862 --> 00:08:23,363
There's a really big difference

194
00:08:23,363 --> 00:08:26,164
between being an indie team that makes products

195
00:08:26,164 --> 00:08:27,845
and an indie team that is a product.

196
00:08:27,845 --> 00:08:29,426
And that's essentially what you're doing.

197
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:31,146
You're productizing your team

198
00:08:31,146 --> 00:08:34,788
and you're selling your services to a client.

199
00:08:34,788 --> 00:08:36,909
So to be successful at doing that,

200
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:39,670
you kind of have to start looking at your team

201
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:42,271
through the eyes of someone who might want to hire you.

202
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:44,633
So what makes you a cool team?

203
00:08:44,633 --> 00:08:46,053
Why would someone want to work with you?

204
00:08:46,053 --> 00:08:48,114
What stuff have you worked on?

205
00:08:48,114 --> 00:08:49,095
How many games?

206
00:08:49,335 --> 00:08:51,236
have you worked on, how complicated were they,

207
00:08:51,236 --> 00:08:54,399
what kind of experience do you bring to bear?

208
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,741
Do you have any tools or processes or philosophies

209
00:08:56,741 --> 00:09:00,163
that you've applied to your own projects

210
00:09:00,163 --> 00:09:02,245
that you could then apply to a client's work

211
00:09:02,245 --> 00:09:03,546
and help them be successful?

212
00:09:05,171 --> 00:09:08,752
So what's your origin story as a contract team?

213
00:09:08,752 --> 00:09:12,573
And once you've answered some of those foundational questions,

214
00:09:12,573 --> 00:09:13,953
the next thing you have to figure out

215
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:17,374
is codify what you're selling.

216
00:09:17,374 --> 00:09:19,775
So are you looking to market yourselves

217
00:09:19,775 --> 00:09:22,015
as a team that can take on an entire game,

218
00:09:22,015 --> 00:09:23,936
or are you more interested in taking

219
00:09:23,936 --> 00:09:25,396
on parts or pieces of a game?

220
00:09:25,396 --> 00:09:30,718
Like tools dev, live ops, feature development, QA,

221
00:09:30,718 --> 00:09:33,718
any one of the thousand things that go into making a game.

222
00:09:35,593 --> 00:09:37,975
So do you want short-term work or long-term work?

223
00:09:37,975 --> 00:09:40,877
So these are all questions that you have to answer.

224
00:09:40,877 --> 00:09:43,459
And once you kind of know who you are as a team

225
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:44,939
and what you're selling, that's going

226
00:09:44,939 --> 00:09:49,282
to help to inform who your potential clients are.

227
00:09:49,282 --> 00:09:52,985
Now, when I'm actually pitching my team,

228
00:09:52,985 --> 00:09:55,906
I position us in the following way.

229
00:09:55,906 --> 00:09:57,648
So we're a bunch of AAA vets.

230
00:09:57,648 --> 00:10:00,509
It's me, I'm a AAA producer, and my team

231
00:10:00,509 --> 00:10:01,810
are a bunch of AAA engineers.

232
00:10:02,877 --> 00:10:04,939
And so we're pretty experienced, and we're pretty bomb-proof

233
00:10:04,939 --> 00:10:07,060
temperament-wise, because we've been through the wars.

234
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,682
So the way I often describe us to clients

235
00:10:09,682 --> 00:10:12,184
is we're like an engineering SEAL team,

236
00:10:12,184 --> 00:10:14,586
in that you can actually drop us into any situation,

237
00:10:14,586 --> 00:10:15,787
doesn't matter how crazy it is.

238
00:10:15,787 --> 00:10:18,769
Bombs could be going off, shrapnel flying everywhere.

239
00:10:18,769 --> 00:10:22,111
And we will very calmly be able to go into the situation,

240
00:10:22,111 --> 00:10:25,133
assess what's going on, come up with a plan,

241
00:10:25,133 --> 00:10:26,695
and then execute against that plan.

242
00:10:26,695 --> 00:10:29,917
And we've actually, in the course of our...

243
00:10:31,378 --> 00:10:34,682
our time consulting, we've had to take on some really crazy projects.

244
00:10:34,682 --> 00:10:37,106
Really high pressure, high stakes,

245
00:10:37,106 --> 00:10:39,449
tight timelines, and we have

246
00:10:39,449 --> 00:10:42,973
a 100 percent track record of delivering on time and on budget.

247
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,404
So we're kind of known in the industry

248
00:10:45,404 --> 00:10:47,245
as being a high-performance, low-drama team.

249
00:10:47,245 --> 00:10:50,386
So because I have that really clear understanding

250
00:10:50,386 --> 00:10:52,567
of who we are, that naturally kind of

251
00:10:52,567 --> 00:10:56,909
informs what kind of clients might be interested in working

252
00:10:56,909 --> 00:10:57,289
with us.

253
00:10:57,289 --> 00:11:00,511
They tend to be larger companies that

254
00:11:00,511 --> 00:11:03,132
need some flexibility in their technical resourcing.

255
00:11:03,132 --> 00:11:05,013
They need senior people to make their problems go away

256
00:11:05,013 --> 00:11:07,034
without a lot of hand-holding.

257
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:08,134
And so that's what we do.

258
00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:13,073
Now I imagine a lot of you, if you've got an indie team where

259
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:15,475
you've got a bunch of designers and artists as well as

260
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:17,317
programmers, you might be thinking that doesn't resonate

261
00:11:17,317 --> 00:11:17,897
with me at all.

262
00:11:17,897 --> 00:11:20,800
So let me give you another example that I think is really

263
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,642
interesting.

264
00:11:22,642 --> 00:11:24,985
I mentor a lot of teams all over the place.

265
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:27,307
And one of my favorites is a team in Australia called

266
00:11:27,307 --> 00:11:28,028
Harmonious Games.

267
00:11:28,028 --> 00:11:29,329
And I don't know if you've heard of them.

268
00:11:30,094 --> 00:11:33,437
great bunch of people and they made a really cool game a couple years ago

269
00:11:33,437 --> 00:11:37,021
that did pretty well on the Switch. It was called Putty Pals.

270
00:11:37,021 --> 00:11:39,924
And it's a co-op platformer where you have to work together with another

271
00:11:39,924 --> 00:11:43,648
player to navigate the world and solve problems.

272
00:11:43,648 --> 00:11:47,412
And I thought it was just a pretty legit fun game but what I didn't know about it

273
00:11:47,412 --> 00:11:49,594
and and I had known these guys for a long

274
00:11:49,594 --> 00:11:51,156
time before they they told me this.

275
00:11:52,657 --> 00:11:54,338
That Putty Pals isn't just a fun game.

276
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:57,080
It was actually designed based on the principles

277
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,922
of promoting the emotional intelligence of their players.

278
00:11:59,922 --> 00:12:02,004
The designer actually studied psychology,

279
00:12:02,004 --> 00:12:03,965
and she was really interested to figure out

280
00:12:03,965 --> 00:12:06,167
how games could accomplish that goal.

281
00:12:06,167 --> 00:12:10,351
And so I was like, wow, that's really interesting.

282
00:12:10,351 --> 00:12:10,891
I didn't know that.

283
00:12:10,891 --> 00:12:13,013
I can see that, because you do have to work

284
00:12:13,013 --> 00:12:15,154
pretty closely together with another player

285
00:12:15,154 --> 00:12:16,956
under stressful circumstances.

286
00:12:17,376 --> 00:12:24,057
And so they then proceeded to tell me that one of their former college professors at one point approached them and said,

287
00:12:24,057 --> 00:12:29,118
you know, this whole thing you've done with Putty Pals, the design based on emotional intelligence,

288
00:12:29,118 --> 00:12:33,079
is really interesting and there's a study going on in the Australian penal system

289
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:37,239
and they want to understand how technology and games could potentially be used to

290
00:12:37,239 --> 00:12:43,300
increase the communication skills of, like, to improve the communication skills of the inmate population.

291
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,561
And we think Putty Pals could be a great pilot.

292
00:12:47,585 --> 00:12:48,906
So they're like, great, sure.

293
00:12:48,906 --> 00:12:52,209
So they gave these researchers an early version

294
00:12:52,209 --> 00:12:52,889
of Putty Pals.

295
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:54,631
They put it in the hands of hardcore felons.

296
00:12:54,631 --> 00:12:56,012
And over the course of the study,

297
00:12:56,012 --> 00:12:59,035
they found that this game actually did increase

298
00:12:59,035 --> 00:13:00,636
the EQ of the inmates.

299
00:13:00,636 --> 00:13:03,038
They were able to communicate more effectively

300
00:13:03,038 --> 00:13:04,880
under stressful circumstances.

301
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:08,061
And when they told me this, I'm like, holy crap,

302
00:13:08,061 --> 00:13:10,082
that is so interesting.

303
00:13:10,082 --> 00:13:12,584
And this was in the context of talking with them

304
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:14,965
about where they could focus their biz dev efforts

305
00:13:14,965 --> 00:13:16,286
for doing some contract work.

306
00:13:16,286 --> 00:13:18,867
And I'm like, I can't believe I didn't know this before,

307
00:13:18,867 --> 00:13:23,509
because your clients aren't just game industry people or game

308
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:24,450
companies.

309
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:25,830
Your clients are anybody who might

310
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:29,512
be interested in understanding how a game or technology could

311
00:13:29,512 --> 00:13:32,774
be used to positively impact people's behavior.

312
00:13:33,683 --> 00:13:36,685
So I tell you this for one very important reason,

313
00:13:36,685 --> 00:13:41,647
and that is that often there's this idea that as indies,

314
00:13:41,647 --> 00:13:44,929
we're all competing for the same small number of jobs.

315
00:13:44,929 --> 00:13:47,471
So it promotes this idea that there's just a lot

316
00:13:47,471 --> 00:13:49,252
of scarcity in the industry.

317
00:13:49,252 --> 00:13:51,353
And that's why going through this process

318
00:13:51,353 --> 00:13:52,774
and being clear on who you are

319
00:13:52,774 --> 00:13:54,795
and what skills and resources you bring to bear

320
00:13:54,795 --> 00:13:57,756
actually goes a long way towards opening up

321
00:13:57,756 --> 00:14:00,158
new potential avenues for work because

322
00:14:00,772 --> 00:14:05,515
The skills that you have in making games can be used to solve other problems.

323
00:14:05,515 --> 00:14:07,557
And so that's what the Harmonious team did.

324
00:14:07,557 --> 00:14:15,904
And they're actually having some interesting luck pursuing academic work

325
00:14:15,904 --> 00:14:22,009
and government grants as well as game companies.

326
00:14:22,009 --> 00:14:24,031
Marco Rubio mouth, sorry.

327
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:27,914
And so last piece of the puzzle here.

328
00:14:29,482 --> 00:14:31,604
in addition to figuring out who you are,

329
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:32,986
who your clients might be, what you're selling,

330
00:14:32,986 --> 00:14:35,128
is figuring out what you should charge.

331
00:14:35,128 --> 00:14:39,352
And this is a hard one, because quite frankly,

332
00:14:39,352 --> 00:14:41,494
most of you should probably charge different rates

333
00:14:41,494 --> 00:14:43,797
based on your relative experience.

334
00:14:44,443 --> 00:14:50,130
So if you want a range, I would say that the range at the low end for dealing with corporate clients would be,

335
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:53,154
if you're an inexperienced team, maybe 40 an hour.

336
00:14:53,154 --> 00:14:54,536
And that can go up to over 200 an hour.

337
00:14:54,536 --> 00:15:01,946
But the average, what most contract clients will probably pay is between 60 and 100.

338
00:15:03,651 --> 00:15:04,431
That's an average.

339
00:15:04,431 --> 00:15:08,392
But in terms of figuring out what you and your team

340
00:15:08,392 --> 00:15:09,973
should charge, that's going to be

341
00:15:09,973 --> 00:15:12,653
based on stuff that's individual to you all.

342
00:15:12,653 --> 00:15:15,654
So again, skills and experience, how many games you've worked on,

343
00:15:15,654 --> 00:15:18,215
years in the industry, how complex the games were

344
00:15:18,215 --> 00:15:21,796
that you've worked on as a team.

345
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:24,656
You probably want to have a range of costs, by the way,

346
00:15:24,656 --> 00:15:25,917
depending on the kinds of projects.

347
00:15:25,917 --> 00:15:28,577
If you want to take on crazy firefighting projects

348
00:15:28,577 --> 00:15:30,398
like we do, you can potentially charge a little more

349
00:15:30,398 --> 00:15:32,838
for those sometimes than longer term work.

350
00:15:34,437 --> 00:15:36,518
Your geographical location can also

351
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:39,960
impact what you can charge, because certain markets will

352
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,881
pay more than others.

353
00:15:40,881 --> 00:15:44,023
But I think one of the most important things

354
00:15:44,023 --> 00:15:48,625
in determining what you should charge is what your goals are.

355
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:53,368
So I think that's a good point to segue

356
00:15:53,368 --> 00:15:54,128
into our next section.

357
00:15:54,128 --> 00:15:56,329
We've talked about who you are.

358
00:15:56,329 --> 00:16:01,172
Now let's talk about what you want.

359
00:16:01,172 --> 00:16:03,753
And I imagine most of you probably want money.

360
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:08,991
Whenever I start working with a team I'm mentoring,

361
00:16:08,991 --> 00:16:10,612
that's what they always say when I say,

362
00:16:10,612 --> 00:16:11,672
what do you want out of this?

363
00:16:11,672 --> 00:16:12,572
They'll say money.

364
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:13,672
If I'm not working on my own games,

365
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:16,813
I just want to make as much as possible.

366
00:16:16,813 --> 00:16:17,654
And I totally get that.

367
00:16:17,654 --> 00:16:18,774
I've been in that position.

368
00:16:18,774 --> 00:16:20,934
That makes perfect sense to me.

369
00:16:20,934 --> 00:16:22,375
But I would also say this.

370
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:25,376
Sometimes we do ourselves a big disservice

371
00:16:25,376 --> 00:16:27,276
by thinking as indies, money is the only thing

372
00:16:27,276 --> 00:16:29,237
we should care about when we're doing contract work.

373
00:16:29,237 --> 00:16:31,877
Because there's a lot of other stuff that might be equally,

374
00:16:31,877 --> 00:16:34,018
if not more important to you when push comes to shove.

375
00:16:35,566 --> 00:16:37,652
like the kinds of projects you want to work on.

376
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:41,739
I think it's really important to not only know what kinds of projects you want to work

377
00:16:41,739 --> 00:16:46,922
on, whether it's genre or platform, but you also need to know what you don't want to work

378
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:47,222
on, right?

379
00:16:47,222 --> 00:16:53,985
Because that's going to help to inform your BizDev efforts, and also, if a project comes

380
00:16:53,985 --> 00:16:58,127
your way that you think is really cool and interesting, you might be willing to take

381
00:16:58,127 --> 00:17:01,849
a little less money if that makes sense at the time for you as a team.

382
00:17:01,849 --> 00:17:06,691
Another often really undervalued upside of doing contract work is experience.

383
00:17:07,111 --> 00:17:11,536
We do a lot of co-development with incredibly amazing world-class companies,

384
00:17:11,536 --> 00:17:13,918
and every single time we do a project with them,

385
00:17:13,918 --> 00:17:16,181
we learn something that potentially makes us

386
00:17:16,181 --> 00:17:19,124
better when we're developing our own indie projects.

387
00:17:19,124 --> 00:17:21,766
So focusing your business efforts on working with

388
00:17:21,766 --> 00:17:25,650
a company that could teach you something that you might need to learn,

389
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:26,751
is also a really good thing.

390
00:17:27,661 --> 00:17:29,842
Now, I have credit listed on here as well.

391
00:17:29,842 --> 00:17:31,583
And I want to note this because if you've never

392
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,485
been through the process of negotiating a contract

393
00:17:34,485 --> 00:17:37,907
with a corporate client, it's easy to assume that, oh, this

394
00:17:37,907 --> 00:17:41,529
will be great because I can actually put something up

395
00:17:41,529 --> 00:17:43,451
on my website and talk about the work I've

396
00:17:43,451 --> 00:17:44,411
done with these clients.

397
00:17:44,411 --> 00:17:45,792
And it was a really cool gig.

398
00:17:45,792 --> 00:17:48,253
And I can use that to promote myself.

399
00:17:48,253 --> 00:17:50,215
And what you should be aware of is that.

400
00:17:51,579 --> 00:17:55,603
A lot of corporate contracts have boilerplate language in them that says that you're not

401
00:17:55,603 --> 00:18:00,408
allowed to talk about anything related to the project you worked on unless the client

402
00:18:00,408 --> 00:18:02,731
gives you their express written permission.

403
00:18:02,731 --> 00:18:06,295
And in some really extreme cases, they'll tell you you can't even mention that you worked

404
00:18:06,295 --> 00:18:08,117
with the client themselves by name.

405
00:18:08,117 --> 00:18:11,640
So if that's something that you feel is going to be really important to getting more work

406
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,563
going forward, that's a point you probably have to negotiate for.

407
00:18:15,124 --> 00:18:17,905
And so sometimes that can involve giving a client

408
00:18:17,905 --> 00:18:20,327
a break on the rate, sometimes you negotiate

409
00:18:20,327 --> 00:18:22,708
for something else, you throw in something else

410
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:25,689
that they might actually want or appreciate

411
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:27,010
to get them to agree to that.

412
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:30,952
Autonomy is also a really big deal, right?

413
00:18:30,952 --> 00:18:33,674
Because I think one of the best parts of being an indie

414
00:18:33,674 --> 00:18:37,136
is feeling like you have some kind of control

415
00:18:37,136 --> 00:18:38,617
over your destiny.

416
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:43,139
And in my experience, autonomy kind of comes in two forms.

417
00:18:43,913 --> 00:18:45,094
creative and operational.

418
00:18:45,094 --> 00:18:48,577
So creative autonomy means you have a lot of say

419
00:18:48,577 --> 00:18:51,820
over what you're making, and operational autonomy

420
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,982
means you have say over how you're gonna make it.

421
00:18:53,982 --> 00:18:55,764
How you run your team, how you run your company,

422
00:18:55,764 --> 00:18:56,745
how you run the project.

423
00:18:56,745 --> 00:19:01,769
And so if having a lot of autonomy and control

424
00:19:01,769 --> 00:19:03,030
is really important to you.

425
00:19:04,707 --> 00:19:09,871
then you might want to actually look for projects that are those kind of self-contained ones

426
00:19:09,871 --> 00:19:13,534
where you're taking on development of a project from beginning to end.

427
00:19:13,534 --> 00:19:16,736
Because in my experience, you don't have quite as much client contact on those.

428
00:19:16,736 --> 00:19:21,700
You meet with them a lot in the beginning, you check in periodically at key milestone

429
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,782
points, and then you hand it off in the end and you're done.

430
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:29,331
That's a really different situation than co-development,

431
00:19:29,331 --> 00:19:30,931
where you literally take members of your team

432
00:19:30,931 --> 00:19:34,413
and you plug them into an existing client project structure

433
00:19:34,413 --> 00:19:35,913
to give them some flexible resourcing.

434
00:19:35,913 --> 00:19:37,754
So you walk in, you check your ego at the door,

435
00:19:37,754 --> 00:19:38,954
and you basically say,

436
00:19:38,954 --> 00:19:41,715
I am here to do whatever you need me to do.

437
00:19:41,715 --> 00:19:44,136
Scenario one, lots of control.

438
00:19:44,136 --> 00:19:46,076
Scenario two, not so much.

439
00:19:46,076 --> 00:19:47,717
Guess which one pays more?

440
00:19:47,717 --> 00:19:50,938
The one where you have less control.

441
00:19:50,938 --> 00:19:52,599
So if control's important to you,

442
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:53,939
you gotta recognize that up front.

443
00:19:55,753 --> 00:19:59,054
Stability is another one, like understanding what your tolerance

444
00:19:59,054 --> 00:20:01,194
for stability and risk is, is another key thing

445
00:20:01,194 --> 00:20:02,955
when you start to do biz dev.

446
00:20:02,955 --> 00:20:05,936
I cannot tell you the number of people over time

447
00:20:05,936 --> 00:20:07,977
who have come to me and basically said,

448
00:20:07,977 --> 00:20:09,777
oh, I've got this really cool opportunity.

449
00:20:09,777 --> 00:20:13,078
If you work for us for free or at a really drastically reduced

450
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:15,979
rate, you can get on the ground floor of this cool tech idea

451
00:20:15,979 --> 00:20:16,259
I have.

452
00:20:16,259 --> 00:20:18,660
And I don't know about you, if I'm going to take a risk,

453
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,061
I'm going to risk stuff on my own project,

454
00:20:21,061 --> 00:20:22,281
not on someone else's ever.

455
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:26,944
So if you don't have a high tolerance for risk,

456
00:20:26,944 --> 00:20:29,046
you're going to want to look for companies that have,

457
00:20:29,046 --> 00:20:31,027
you know, they're stable, they're well-funded,

458
00:20:31,027 --> 00:20:33,870
they can pay you on time, and they can pay you on your terms.

459
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:36,492
By terms, I mean net 30.

460
00:20:36,492 --> 00:20:39,455
And net 30 means you will be paid 30 days

461
00:20:39,455 --> 00:20:42,117
after they receive the invoice.

462
00:20:42,397 --> 00:20:44,878
And it's also worth noting that a lot of corporate clients

463
00:20:44,878 --> 00:20:47,119
in their contracts, they'll have standard terms being net 60

464
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:47,959
or net 90.

465
00:20:47,959 --> 00:20:52,541
And that's the thing that you can negotiate for.

466
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,862
That's a really easy point of negotiation.

467
00:20:54,862 --> 00:20:57,663
I have never had a client say, nope, we will not

468
00:20:57,663 --> 00:20:58,823
pay you on net 30 terms.

469
00:20:58,823 --> 00:21:01,044
Because all you have to do is explain,

470
00:21:01,044 --> 00:21:02,244
we're a tiny indie studio.

471
00:21:02,244 --> 00:21:05,065
And for cash flow reasons, we need

472
00:21:05,065 --> 00:21:06,806
you to pay us sooner than that.

473
00:21:06,806 --> 00:21:11,748
And it's often literally just that simple.

474
00:21:11,748 --> 00:21:11,788
No?

475
00:21:15,171 --> 00:21:17,392
It's entirely possible that you're

476
00:21:17,392 --> 00:21:18,832
going to find a cool project that's

477
00:21:18,832 --> 00:21:23,433
going to come your way that meets a lot of these goals.

478
00:21:23,433 --> 00:21:24,073
It's interesting.

479
00:21:24,073 --> 00:21:26,014
Your team wants to work on it.

480
00:21:26,014 --> 00:21:28,014
It potentially can give you some experience

481
00:21:28,014 --> 00:21:31,295
that will help you be good at developing your own games.

482
00:21:31,295 --> 00:21:33,276
But the client just doesn't have enough budget

483
00:21:33,276 --> 00:21:35,757
to pay you your rates.

484
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:38,290
So how do you handle that?

485
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,491
Well, you can certainly just say, OK,

486
00:21:39,491 --> 00:21:40,891
I'm going to give you a lower rate

487
00:21:40,891 --> 00:21:42,232
and just kind of forget about it.

488
00:21:42,232 --> 00:21:44,132
But there's a more productive way

489
00:21:44,132 --> 00:21:45,973
of handling that, which I highly recommend,

490
00:21:45,973 --> 00:21:48,314
which is applying a formal sales discount.

491
00:21:48,314 --> 00:21:51,495
So sales discount is exactly what it sounds like.

492
00:21:51,495 --> 00:21:53,836
You're agreeing to give the client a reduced rate

493
00:21:53,836 --> 00:21:55,757
for the duration of a single project.

494
00:21:57,098 --> 00:21:59,720
And I've found that these are really effective as long

495
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,141
as they're visible.

496
00:22:01,141 --> 00:22:03,763
So for the first time in a really long time,

497
00:22:03,763 --> 00:22:05,665
I gave a sales discount to a client

498
00:22:05,665 --> 00:22:07,626
because it was really interesting work.

499
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:11,609
And so every month when I invoice them,

500
00:22:11,609 --> 00:22:13,851
I have three line items on the invoice.

501
00:22:13,851 --> 00:22:17,974
The top line is how much I would have charged

502
00:22:17,974 --> 00:22:19,575
if I was charging my full rate.

503
00:22:20,556 --> 00:22:22,337
Bottom line is what I agreed to charge them.

504
00:22:22,337 --> 00:22:25,718
And in the middle, I subtract the difference between the two,

505
00:22:25,718 --> 00:22:26,959
and I have a sales discount.

506
00:22:26,959 --> 00:22:28,900
And that's an actual dollar figure

507
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,260
the client sees every month.

508
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,601
Now, you might think, well, that's a lot of extra work.

509
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:33,742
Why would you do that?

510
00:22:33,742 --> 00:22:36,463
Well, because it codifies my investment in the project,

511
00:22:36,463 --> 00:22:37,863
and it makes it much easier for me

512
00:22:37,863 --> 00:22:40,084
to have a hard conversation with a client down the line.

513
00:22:40,084 --> 00:22:41,505
If they want to keep working with us

514
00:22:41,505 --> 00:22:44,606
for another phase of the project, I can say,

515
00:22:44,606 --> 00:22:47,087
look at how much money I've invested in this project.

516
00:22:47,507 --> 00:22:53,551
So this is below our normal rate and I'd like to figure out a way to get closer to what I would normally charge.

517
00:22:53,551 --> 00:22:54,631
And if you can't do that,

518
00:22:54,631 --> 00:23:00,354
then let's figure out some other way that we might be able to come up with an equitable situation.

519
00:23:00,354 --> 00:23:02,595
So sales discounts are your friend, use them.

520
00:23:02,595 --> 00:23:05,897
Okay. So I can go on and on.

521
00:23:05,897 --> 00:23:07,278
I'm running a little late on time here.

522
00:23:07,278 --> 00:23:10,379
So let me move on to the third item on my list,

523
00:23:10,379 --> 00:23:13,021
my original list, which is understanding what your options are.

524
00:23:14,318 --> 00:23:16,660
Now, here I'm talking about something very specific,

525
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:19,482
and that is, again, how you structure projects

526
00:23:19,482 --> 00:23:20,402
around compensation.

527
00:23:20,402 --> 00:23:22,744
This goes back to what I said in the beginning

528
00:23:22,744 --> 00:23:24,946
about asking people how they did that

529
00:23:24,946 --> 00:23:28,548
and hearing over and over again that the only option for games

530
00:23:28,548 --> 00:23:30,830
was time and material, I'm sorry, fixed bid.

531
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:34,493
And I didn't find that especially good news

532
00:23:34,493 --> 00:23:37,995
at the time, because I don't think fixed bids are

533
00:23:37,995 --> 00:23:39,156
a good model for games at all.

534
00:23:40,347 --> 00:23:42,787
I'll explain why in a minute, but I'm quite serious.

535
00:23:42,787 --> 00:23:46,728
I don't think it's an ideal model for the games industry.

536
00:23:46,728 --> 00:23:48,689
And I also wasn't happy to hear that at the time

537
00:23:48,689 --> 00:23:51,690
because I feel like whenever anyone says there's only one

538
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:54,530
way to do something, the minute you accept that that's true,

539
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:55,891
you stop looking for other options.

540
00:23:55,891 --> 00:23:58,831
And there actually are some really good options out there

541
00:23:58,831 --> 00:24:01,912
that are not only good for you, but they're also

542
00:24:01,912 --> 00:24:03,273
good for the client as well.

543
00:24:03,273 --> 00:24:05,353
But before I get into that, do you guys

544
00:24:05,353 --> 00:24:06,433
know what a fixed bid is?

545
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,310
Have you heard of that term?

546
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:12,311
It's basically like a contractual agreement

547
00:24:12,311 --> 00:24:15,472
to make a thing and charge a set amount of money for that thing

548
00:24:15,472 --> 00:24:17,893
and you deliver it within a specific time period.

549
00:24:17,893 --> 00:24:21,154
So the secret of the fixed bid project

550
00:24:21,154 --> 00:24:23,274
is just a shit ton of planning goes

551
00:24:23,274 --> 00:24:24,755
into making those successful.

552
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:27,395
You have to be very, very careful in how

553
00:24:27,395 --> 00:24:28,796
you plan a fixed bid project.

554
00:24:28,796 --> 00:24:30,516
You have to come in with an airtight scope,

555
00:24:30,516 --> 00:24:35,097
a lot of documentation, detailed milestone deliverables

556
00:24:35,097 --> 00:24:35,598
with.

557
00:24:36,935 --> 00:24:40,737
with also equally detailed tasks associated with each one.

558
00:24:40,737 --> 00:24:44,379
And the reason why you have to have all that

559
00:24:44,379 --> 00:24:46,760
is in preparation for that inevitable moment

560
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,461
when the client says to you,

561
00:24:48,461 --> 00:24:51,242
you know, I'm pretty sure that was supposed to be in scope.

562
00:24:52,763 --> 00:24:55,405
And that's going to happen every time on every project.

563
00:24:55,405 --> 00:24:58,286
And I'm not going to say clients aren't evil when they do that.

564
00:24:58,286 --> 00:25:02,107
It is their job to try and get as much as they possibly can

565
00:25:02,107 --> 00:25:04,728
and get the best possible thing from anyone

566
00:25:04,728 --> 00:25:05,469
that they work with.

567
00:25:05,469 --> 00:25:07,830
But ideally, you don't want to have

568
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:09,911
to do that at your expense, right?

569
00:25:09,911 --> 00:25:13,492
So you have to be prepared with some kind of argument that

570
00:25:13,492 --> 00:25:15,793
says, no, as you can see, clearly that's not part of scope.

571
00:25:15,793 --> 00:25:17,474
But I can actually give you a change order.

572
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:20,035
And I'd be happy to do it for x amount more money.

573
00:25:21,542 --> 00:25:27,466
So yeah, fixed bids, they're a little bit tricky.

574
00:25:27,466 --> 00:25:29,567
And I gotta say, I spent a little bit of time

575
00:25:29,567 --> 00:25:31,769
outside of games several years ago,

576
00:25:31,769 --> 00:25:34,351
working for companies that did work for hire

577
00:25:34,351 --> 00:25:36,192
in web app and software development,

578
00:25:36,192 --> 00:25:37,633
so just straight tech projects.

579
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:41,331
And I gotta say, I think tech projects compared to games

580
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,312
are just so much more simple.

581
00:25:43,312 --> 00:25:45,113
Because your ability to be successful

582
00:25:45,113 --> 00:25:47,154
on those kinds of projects are based on three things

583
00:25:47,154 --> 00:25:48,794
and three things only.

584
00:25:48,794 --> 00:25:49,875
Is it on time?

585
00:25:49,875 --> 00:25:50,735
Is it on budget?

586
00:25:50,735 --> 00:25:51,875
Did you nail your scope?

587
00:25:51,875 --> 00:25:54,836
And if you can say yes, yes, and yes, you're good.

588
00:25:54,836 --> 00:25:55,557
You're done.

589
00:25:55,557 --> 00:25:58,018
You were successful in running that project.

590
00:25:58,578 --> 00:26:01,500
But with games, we have this fourth factor of, is it fun?

591
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:05,742
And as we all know, fun is really hard to schedule for

592
00:26:05,742 --> 00:26:07,363
sometimes, right?

593
00:26:07,363 --> 00:26:12,026
Like sometimes, a project to just really nail your core

594
00:26:12,026 --> 00:26:15,688
game loop, it requires a lot more iteration

595
00:26:15,688 --> 00:26:17,649
than you expected.

596
00:26:17,649 --> 00:26:20,271
Or maybe it requires a lot of collaboration.

597
00:26:20,271 --> 00:26:23,753
And iteration and collaboration and fixed bids

598
00:26:23,753 --> 00:26:25,214
are antithetical to each other.

599
00:26:25,214 --> 00:26:27,855
They are absolutely functioning at cross purposes.

600
00:26:29,508 --> 00:26:34,751
And by the way, if anyone ever comes to you and says,

601
00:26:34,751 --> 00:26:37,452
hey, I love working, give me a fixed bid.

602
00:26:37,452 --> 00:26:39,573
By the way, I love working with my vendors

603
00:26:39,573 --> 00:26:41,234
in a really collaborative way.

604
00:26:41,234 --> 00:26:42,935
The answer should just be, nope,

605
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:45,276
that's not gonna work out well.

606
00:26:45,276 --> 00:26:47,918
And if someone says, hey, I wanna do a fixed bid project

607
00:26:47,918 --> 00:26:51,399
with you, but we also, we do agile development.

608
00:26:51,399 --> 00:26:53,821
The answer is, hell, nope, no, do not do that.

609
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:55,241
That's not gonna work out well for you.

610
00:26:56,780 --> 00:27:03,283
So obviously, you know, it's not easy to plan every project perfectly,

611
00:27:03,283 --> 00:27:07,806
because sometimes the clients themselves don't know exactly what they're going to need from you.

612
00:27:07,806 --> 00:27:12,549
So for clients that need more flexibility, and they want to collaborate,

613
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:14,330
obviously a fixed bid is a bad option.

614
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:17,752
So there is a second option, and that's time and materials.

615
00:27:17,752 --> 00:27:21,494
Basically, a time and materials project, think of it as just an hourly engagement

616
00:27:21,494 --> 00:27:23,995
where you're selling your time to a client by the hour.

617
00:27:25,232 --> 00:27:28,993
So you basically come in and say, my rate is x.

618
00:27:28,993 --> 00:27:32,434
I have y number of people coming on the project.

619
00:27:32,434 --> 00:27:35,514
So we're just going to keep building until the job is done.

620
00:27:35,514 --> 00:27:39,095
And that's good for you, because you're

621
00:27:39,095 --> 00:27:41,436
going to get paid for every hour that you work.

622
00:27:41,436 --> 00:27:44,036
And it's good for the clients, because it does

623
00:27:44,036 --> 00:27:45,236
give them some flexibility.

624
00:27:45,236 --> 00:27:47,077
But it's also not so great for the clients,

625
00:27:47,077 --> 00:27:50,558
because it kind of makes them feel like they're signing up

626
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:51,638
to hand you a blank check.

627
00:27:52,018 --> 00:27:56,282
I'm in the middle of getting my porch rebuilt and I've been interviewing contractors.

628
00:27:56,282 --> 00:27:59,504
I have to say if one of them turned up and said,

629
00:27:59,504 --> 00:28:03,588
I don't really know how long this is going to take or what materials I'm going to need,

630
00:28:03,588 --> 00:28:05,169
but I'm just going to show up with my crew on

631
00:28:05,169 --> 00:28:06,950
Monday and we're just going to start doing stuff,

632
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:09,212
and I'm going to hand you an invoice when this is over,

633
00:28:09,212 --> 00:28:10,393
I'd be like, oh my God,

634
00:28:10,393 --> 00:28:13,996
that sounds terrifying, never.

635
00:28:13,996 --> 00:28:15,617
So clients often feel the same.

636
00:28:16,503 --> 00:28:18,445
But there is actually a third option,

637
00:28:18,445 --> 00:28:21,908
and that is called time of materials not to exceed.

638
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:24,050
And this is something that is much better known

639
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:27,993
in tech consulting circles, but not so much in games.

640
00:28:27,993 --> 00:28:29,975
And I would really love to see this change

641
00:28:29,975 --> 00:28:32,437
because this is, I think, a much better model

642
00:28:32,437 --> 00:28:33,278
for our industry.

643
00:28:35,205 --> 00:28:39,368
So this is kind of like a tweener between time and materials and fixed bids.

644
00:28:39,368 --> 00:28:40,069
Right?

645
00:28:40,069 --> 00:28:45,132
So you go in and you start it off like you would a fixed bid project.

646
00:28:45,132 --> 00:28:48,154
You understand what the client is trying to achieve.

647
00:28:48,154 --> 00:28:49,014
You do your due diligence.

648
00:28:49,014 --> 00:28:54,758
You go off and you plan and say, I think that we're going to need X number of people for

649
00:28:54,758 --> 00:28:56,799
X number of time and it's going to cost this much.

650
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:01,502
And you basically say, here is my rough plan of how I'm going to attack this problem.

651
00:29:02,285 --> 00:29:04,246
But this is where it diverges from a fixed bid.

652
00:29:04,246 --> 00:29:09,209
Because instead of committing to a very specific set of

653
00:29:09,209 --> 00:29:13,011
deliverables and a specific scope, you're basically

654
00:29:13,011 --> 00:29:17,774
committing to keep within your price range and work with the

655
00:29:17,774 --> 00:29:19,675
client on an ongoing, flexible basis.

656
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:23,317
So with us, when we do these kinds of projects, we sit down

657
00:29:23,317 --> 00:29:24,578
with the clients every week.

658
00:29:24,578 --> 00:29:27,740
And we say, here's where we're tracking against our original

659
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:28,000
plan.

660
00:29:29,699 --> 00:29:32,140
Do you feel like we need to change course?

661
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,741
If we feel that the project needs to change course, we'll

662
00:29:34,741 --> 00:29:35,762
make some recommendations.

663
00:29:35,762 --> 00:29:39,143
Then we sit down and work with a client to figure out what

664
00:29:39,143 --> 00:29:41,084
the impact of that will be.

665
00:29:41,084 --> 00:29:44,386
So if it's going to take more time or more budget, and they

666
00:29:44,386 --> 00:29:47,367
don't have that, then we will sit back down with them and

667
00:29:47,367 --> 00:29:49,508
say, OK, well, let's figure out how we can reduce scope

668
00:29:49,508 --> 00:29:52,890
to get you to the closest point of what you actually

669
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:57,832
need for the money that you actually have.

670
00:29:57,832 --> 00:29:58,412
So.

671
00:29:59,824 --> 00:30:02,065
Time Materials NTE is a great model.

672
00:30:02,065 --> 00:30:05,067
Again, if you have any questions about how to potentially

673
00:30:05,067 --> 00:30:07,248
sell this into your teams or your clients,

674
00:30:07,248 --> 00:30:09,590
feel free to reach out to me.

675
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:12,111
I'd be happy to help you because I would love to see this

676
00:30:12,111 --> 00:30:13,071
be more pervasive.

677
00:30:13,071 --> 00:30:15,653
I think it's really good for all of us.

678
00:30:15,653 --> 00:30:18,394
And I am almost running out of time.

679
00:30:18,394 --> 00:30:21,516
So I've got one last section to cover,

680
00:30:21,516 --> 00:30:23,657
and that is the stuff you need to put in place

681
00:30:23,657 --> 00:30:24,198
to be successful.

682
00:30:24,975 --> 00:30:27,036
So we've talked about who you are, what you want,

683
00:30:27,036 --> 00:30:27,756
what's possible.

684
00:30:27,756 --> 00:30:31,577
Now let's talk about all the things you need to do to make

685
00:30:31,577 --> 00:30:32,477
sure you're successful.

686
00:30:32,477 --> 00:30:35,478
And I saved the worst for last, because I know saying

687
00:30:35,478 --> 00:30:37,979
this stuff in front of a room full of Indies, you're going

688
00:30:37,979 --> 00:30:39,679
to hate everything I'm about to say.

689
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:40,960
So brace yourselves.

690
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,599
If you're going to do these kinds of projects,

691
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:49,900
I'm sorry, you're going to probably have to implement

692
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,441
some timesheets.

693
00:30:51,441 --> 00:30:52,922
And it's a really hard transition.

694
00:30:52,922 --> 00:30:53,842
Your team will hate you.

695
00:30:53,842 --> 00:30:56,583
They'll be super angry because there's a big difference

696
00:30:56,583 --> 00:30:59,144
between being free and easy indies

697
00:30:59,144 --> 00:31:01,586
and being consultants that have to keep track of their hours.

698
00:31:02,707 --> 00:31:03,687
But you still got to do it.

699
00:31:03,687 --> 00:31:06,508
If you're doing any kind of time and materials work,

700
00:31:06,508 --> 00:31:10,290
you have to be pretty scrupulous about what you charge.

701
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:12,751
If you charge 38.25 hours, that's all you can,

702
00:31:12,751 --> 00:31:15,252
if that's how long you spend, that's all you can bill for.

703
00:31:15,252 --> 00:31:19,533
You don't bill for 40 like you would on a fixed bid.

704
00:31:19,533 --> 00:31:19,713
So.

705
00:31:20,945 --> 00:31:23,586
Necessary for time materials, but also really important

706
00:31:23,586 --> 00:31:26,007
for fixed bids as well, because I know quite a few indies

707
00:31:26,007 --> 00:31:28,488
that have taken on fully self-contained projects,

708
00:31:28,488 --> 00:31:30,749
and they end up underbidding the work

709
00:31:30,749 --> 00:31:35,330
and working 60, 70 hours a week to actually make up for it.

710
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:37,171
And so it's really important to understand

711
00:31:37,171 --> 00:31:39,111
where your time is going, so the next time you

712
00:31:39,111 --> 00:31:41,252
take on a project like that, you can actually

713
00:31:41,252 --> 00:31:43,613
understand how long things actually take.

714
00:31:43,613 --> 00:31:47,674
So it's going to help you to improve your bidding

715
00:31:47,674 --> 00:31:48,795
skills and abilities.

716
00:31:50,553 --> 00:31:52,214
So another thing that I highly recommend

717
00:31:52,214 --> 00:31:53,834
is that you get a project manager.

718
00:31:53,834 --> 00:31:56,135
And I know many of you are probably inwardly groaning,

719
00:31:56,135 --> 00:31:58,336
going, we can barely feed ourselves.

720
00:31:58,336 --> 00:31:59,836
We can't take on another person.

721
00:31:59,836 --> 00:32:03,277
And it's easy to see how taking on a project manager

722
00:32:03,277 --> 00:32:04,677
would feel like another mouth to feed.

723
00:32:04,677 --> 00:32:07,058
But I will say this.

724
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:09,139
When you're doing consulting projects,

725
00:32:09,139 --> 00:32:11,739
a project manager is not a cost center.

726
00:32:11,739 --> 00:32:13,340
It's a revenue generator.

727
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,441
You actually bill for their time as you

728
00:32:15,441 --> 00:32:16,841
would anyone else on your team.

729
00:32:18,267 --> 00:32:21,289
And project managers, I find, are really good to have on the team,

730
00:32:21,289 --> 00:32:26,492
especially when you have a team that's not happy about doing consulting projects.

731
00:32:26,492 --> 00:32:30,515
And I think one of the reasons why people feel unhappy about doing consulting,

732
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:33,597
aside from all the obvious, is they feel like

733
00:32:33,597 --> 00:32:35,798
they have to spend time doing things they don't like to do,

734
00:32:35,798 --> 00:32:38,780
like managing projects and handling clients.

735
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:42,362
So it's a lot better if you can just let your team be good at what they're doing,

736
00:32:42,362 --> 00:32:44,003
you know, good at what they do.

737
00:32:44,664 --> 00:32:49,908
and let someone else handle all the tedious project management

738
00:32:49,908 --> 00:32:51,910
and managing client expectations.

739
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:54,812
And managing client expectations is a huge part

740
00:32:54,812 --> 00:32:57,834
of being successful when you do any kind of consulting.

741
00:32:57,834 --> 00:33:00,396
Which brings me to my next thing.

742
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,040
Whether you have a project manager or not,

743
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,522
unfortunately, you've got to do status reports when

744
00:33:06,522 --> 00:33:08,364
you do this kind of work.

745
00:33:08,364 --> 00:33:10,506
Because I'm a big believer in nothing should ever

746
00:33:10,506 --> 00:33:13,848
be an unhappy surprise for your clients,

747
00:33:13,848 --> 00:33:15,570
or for you, for that matter.

748
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:18,973
And so doing status reports is a really great way

749
00:33:18,973 --> 00:33:22,235
of heading those potential unhappy surprises off

750
00:33:22,235 --> 00:33:22,876
at the pass.

751
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:25,330
Now, obviously, because I'm out of time,

752
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:27,390
I don't have a lot of time to get

753
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:32,211
into how you could actually use status reports to help manage

754
00:33:32,211 --> 00:33:32,831
client expectations.

755
00:33:32,831 --> 00:33:34,832
But I did do a talk at GDC a couple of years

756
00:33:34,832 --> 00:33:36,812
ago called Up Shit Creek, Managing

757
00:33:36,812 --> 00:33:38,513
the Unmanageable Project.

758
00:33:38,513 --> 00:33:41,593
And GDC just put it up on their YouTube channel for free.

759
00:33:41,593 --> 00:33:43,914
So about a third of the way through,

760
00:33:43,914 --> 00:33:46,134
I spent a lot of time talking about managing expectations

761
00:33:46,134 --> 00:33:47,754
on really difficult projects.

762
00:33:47,754 --> 00:33:50,275
And so there's a bunch of potentially useful information

763
00:33:50,275 --> 00:33:52,815
in there about how to use status reports to.

764
00:33:53,007 --> 00:33:55,049
keep the clients happy.

765
00:33:55,049 --> 00:33:57,212
And last but not least,

766
00:33:57,212 --> 00:33:59,995
this is another thing that goes against the grain

767
00:33:59,995 --> 00:34:03,098
for a lot of indies, but you probably need to get an attorney

768
00:34:03,098 --> 00:34:05,140
if you're taking on any kind of contract work

769
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,161
where you have a.

770
00:34:06,972 --> 00:34:09,515
You have a client giving you a legal agreement

771
00:34:09,515 --> 00:34:11,416
and asking you to sign it.

772
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:14,780
And if you are actually going to take on an attorney,

773
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:17,442
I would highly recommend you find someone

774
00:34:17,442 --> 00:34:19,144
who's actually indie-friendly.

775
00:34:19,144 --> 00:34:22,207
And there are several out there, because their job is

776
00:34:22,207 --> 00:34:24,449
to actually make you smarter.

777
00:34:24,449 --> 00:34:27,171
Their job isn't to negotiate the contract for you.

778
00:34:27,171 --> 00:34:28,452
That's not what they're there for.

779
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:31,236
They're there to make you smarter,

780
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:34,400
help you to understand how to make smart choices

781
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,764
based on the information you have in front of you,

782
00:34:36,764 --> 00:34:40,669
and to show you where there's potential to negotiate,

783
00:34:40,669 --> 00:34:44,394
which is not always obvious to all of us if we haven't gone through that process.

784
00:34:45,342 --> 00:34:47,342
So if you're interested in finding a good attorney,

785
00:34:47,342 --> 00:34:49,103
I can certainly recommend ours.

786
00:34:49,103 --> 00:34:51,984
Or I might be able to point you in some other directions

787
00:34:51,984 --> 00:34:54,365
from some other attorneys that I know that work with indies.

788
00:34:54,365 --> 00:34:56,046
But definitely get one.

789
00:34:56,046 --> 00:34:58,167
It'll change your life.

790
00:34:58,167 --> 00:34:58,767
It's worth doing.

791
00:34:58,767 --> 00:35:02,728
And one final thought I want to leave you with.

792
00:35:03,915 --> 00:35:05,956
So we're here at GDC this week, and this

793
00:35:05,956 --> 00:35:09,098
is a time where a lot of people are going to be looking for work

794
00:35:09,098 --> 00:35:11,179
and be really stressed out and steeped

795
00:35:11,179 --> 00:35:12,440
in that idea of scarcity.

796
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,721
There's not enough good to go around.

797
00:35:13,721 --> 00:35:16,663
There's no room to negotiate.

798
00:35:16,663 --> 00:35:18,304
It's hard doing this kind of work.

799
00:35:18,304 --> 00:35:21,105
So I just want to leave you with this one final thought.

800
00:35:23,217 --> 00:35:25,897
you can't allow other people's bad experiences and fear

801
00:35:25,897 --> 00:35:27,418
to define what's possible for you.

802
00:35:27,418 --> 00:35:30,339
Because the minute you accept other people's limitations

803
00:35:30,339 --> 00:35:32,740
as your own, you're horribly, horribly screwed.

804
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,540
You're never going to be able to get past them.

805
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,641
That is good advice for contracting,

806
00:35:36,641 --> 00:35:37,961
and it's good advice for life.

807
00:35:37,961 --> 00:35:41,342
So I just want to thank you all so much.

808
00:35:41,342 --> 00:35:43,083
And if there's anything I can do to help you,

809
00:35:43,083 --> 00:35:45,223
I'll be bumping around GDC this week.

810
00:35:45,704 --> 00:35:49,005
I'd be happy to help out or you can reach out to me on LinkedIn or Twitter,

811
00:35:49,005 --> 00:35:50,526
unless you're trying to sell me middleware,

812
00:35:50,526 --> 00:35:52,967
in which case, please do not reach out to me on LinkedIn or Twitter.

813
00:35:52,967 --> 00:35:56,669
But thank you so much and I genuinely really wish you all the best.

814
00:35:56,669 --> 00:35:57,009
Thanks.
