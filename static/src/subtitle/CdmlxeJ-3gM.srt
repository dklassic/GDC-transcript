1
00:00:05,472 --> 00:00:11,496
So hi, I'm Chris Brown and I'm giving a talk today, Fighting LEGOs, Audio Choreography

2
00:00:11,536 --> 00:00:12,337
for Battle Design.

3
00:00:12,657 --> 00:00:18,081
What that really means is discussing the change in how we record what I call vocal sound effects

4
00:00:18,441 --> 00:00:24,345
or omnis or onos, kinds of the sound effects that you're going to hear when you're playing

5
00:00:24,405 --> 00:00:25,026
battle design.

6
00:00:25,646 --> 00:00:27,468
So it means...

7
00:00:29,004 --> 00:00:30,405
If this works correctly.

8
00:00:31,586 --> 00:00:34,227
Using voiceover sound effects as a game mechanic.

9
00:00:34,307 --> 00:00:35,368
We have a lot of...

10
00:00:36,168 --> 00:00:37,609
We used to, on carts, right,

11
00:00:37,629 --> 00:00:40,310
you'd have to cut everything down to its minimum thing.

12
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,051
You'd only have a binary choice.

13
00:00:44,332 --> 00:00:45,613
Something like this going from this,

14
00:00:45,653 --> 00:00:46,933
where we're enhancing a moment.

15
00:00:47,254 --> 00:00:49,094
Somebody gives a punch, somebody receives a punch.

16
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:51,356
It's just a small sound that lets you know,

17
00:00:51,496 --> 00:00:53,277
oh, okay, they've given or received a punch.

18
00:00:54,237 --> 00:00:56,818
We're gonna move now more into...

19
00:00:57,372 --> 00:01:02,696
a world, this is a still from For Honor, where the voiceover sound effects that you're hearing

20
00:01:02,776 --> 00:01:08,661
back from the game are actually helping you to learn how to play the game and to confirm

21
00:01:08,721 --> 00:01:11,884
for you that you are playing the game correctly.

22
00:01:13,345 --> 00:01:13,566
Why?

23
00:01:13,886 --> 00:01:16,968
So, why does it matter if voiceover sound effects help you play the game well?

24
00:01:17,349 --> 00:01:18,570
Isn't enhancement enough?

25
00:01:19,631 --> 00:01:21,112
For me, I'm always looking for...

26
00:01:21,472 --> 00:01:24,375
There are ways to help people understand the world better.

27
00:01:25,496 --> 00:01:29,619
When I want to bring a change to the table, people, why?

28
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:30,340
Why do we have to change?

29
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,320
Why do we have to do it that way?

30
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,422
Doesn't it, you know, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

31
00:01:34,403 --> 00:01:36,685
So we kind of always go back to this.

32
00:01:36,765 --> 00:01:37,946
What's the purpose of sound design?

33
00:01:37,966 --> 00:01:40,788
When we're finding why we're gonna make a change,

34
00:01:40,888 --> 00:01:42,610
is it gonna serve our greater mission?

35
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:45,932
For me, the greater mission is always providing the information you need to

36
00:01:45,993 --> 00:01:49,155
know to interact optimally with the world.

37
00:01:52,164 --> 00:01:59,151
And again, this talk is audio boot camp, so it's made for people who are coming into sound

38
00:01:59,191 --> 00:02:01,893
design, which is why we're going to just do a brief overview.

39
00:02:01,933 --> 00:02:06,738
When we talk about getting the information that you need to understand and to interact

40
00:02:06,878 --> 00:02:11,343
optimally with the world, we're looking at things that provide feelings and context for

41
00:02:11,403 --> 00:02:11,483
you.

42
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,213
It helps you comprehend the world.

43
00:02:14,353 --> 00:02:16,376
It helps you be motivated.

44
00:02:16,576 --> 00:02:20,122
For me, when I hear drums starting, I get fired up.

45
00:02:20,342 --> 00:02:21,243
I'm ready for battle.

46
00:02:21,524 --> 00:02:24,227
You know, you have kind of these classic archetypes, right?

47
00:02:24,248 --> 00:02:28,233
Your minor chords of danger and loss, strength of drama, your brass of victory, kind of

48
00:02:28,554 --> 00:02:34,659
The things that are the standard language that we use in audio to convey certain emotional

49
00:02:35,279 --> 00:02:40,223
feelings to people to let them understand that this is what's going on in the game in

50
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:43,706
the moment and to help them be motivated to move forward.

51
00:02:45,068 --> 00:02:48,771
When we look about ambiances, when we talk about ambiances, this is a still from Red

52
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:50,192
Dead, as I'm sure you know.

53
00:02:51,513 --> 00:02:57,354
You think about the desert, this feeling of desolation, this feeling of loneliness,

54
00:02:57,454 --> 00:03:02,055
this aridity, this kind of you'll hear a lone coyote howl.

55
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:06,256
It's always reflective of Marston's psychological state,

56
00:03:06,636 --> 00:03:10,356
this feeling of being sort of the lone person out there,

57
00:03:10,716 --> 00:03:12,497
maybe the only one who understands the world,

58
00:03:12,537 --> 00:03:15,837
maybe the only one who understands, you know, the grim realities,

59
00:03:15,897 --> 00:03:18,638
the mechanisms of how the world truly functions.

60
00:03:19,071 --> 00:03:25,057
It helps to convey the sense of being very kind of lost also.

61
00:03:26,619 --> 00:03:32,725
When we think about ambiances, we think also about bio shock, feelings of you'll hear the

62
00:03:32,825 --> 00:03:37,890
creaking, you'll hear the water, it's very haunting, and you don't, players don't really

63
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:42,192
sit back and say, why am I feeling creeped out all the time?

64
00:03:42,412 --> 00:03:45,615
You know, you've got these sounds, you've got the splicers coming at you, you have the,

65
00:03:45,715 --> 00:03:49,358
you know, big daddy groans, you have these sounds that are individual sounds that are

66
00:03:49,398 --> 00:03:55,282
giving you a feeling, but underneath it all you have this bed of the actual pressure,

67
00:03:55,342 --> 00:04:00,066
not only of the moment, but the pressure of the ocean on this thing that at any second

68
00:04:00,126 --> 00:04:01,487
It could break through.

69
00:04:01,827 --> 00:04:07,931
So we talk about sound, we talk about music providing you feelings, context, we talk about

70
00:04:08,051 --> 00:04:11,473
ambiences providing you feelings and context.

71
00:04:12,494 --> 00:04:18,638
When we talk about non-voiceover sound effects, we talk about actionable tool info, right?

72
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:20,920
So you're looking at the Lancer, you are...

73
00:04:22,508 --> 00:04:24,110
hearing it, you're hearing its power.

74
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,031
It's kind of exciting.

75
00:04:25,091 --> 00:04:25,911
It's kind of grindy.

76
00:04:25,931 --> 00:04:28,193
You're like, how much can I F people up with this?

77
00:04:28,254 --> 00:04:30,455
It's very exciting and fun.

78
00:04:30,515 --> 00:04:32,177
And not that I'd like to do that.

79
00:04:32,217 --> 00:04:37,001
But, so, right here's your garage, Agent 47,

80
00:04:37,522 --> 00:04:40,264
it doesn't make any sound, which is important.

81
00:04:41,085 --> 00:04:41,545
You have,

82
00:04:44,238 --> 00:04:47,279
Oh my gosh, why am I blanking on the Warthog?

83
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:48,259
Okay.

84
00:04:48,339 --> 00:04:54,341
My favorite vehicle, because it's small, it's light, it revs at a slightly higher pitch,

85
00:04:54,401 --> 00:04:58,962
it lets you know, oh, this is more nimble, this is not heavy as a tank, this is going

86
00:04:58,982 --> 00:05:04,344
to let me go up and on crags and on rocks, and it's all things that, again, without the

87
00:05:04,384 --> 00:05:07,365
player really thinking about it, it lets them know.

88
00:05:07,805 --> 00:05:09,186
These are the rules of the world.

89
00:05:09,506 --> 00:05:14,589
These are things that are at my disposal that help me understand the mechanics of

90
00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:17,551
the game design itself that help me move around.

91
00:05:17,611 --> 00:05:21,933
So in that way, your sound effects are helping to fill out level design.

92
00:05:22,974 --> 00:05:23,534
It's pretty neat.

93
00:05:24,315 --> 00:05:30,198
When we think about voiceover sound effects, binary enhancement, right?

94
00:05:30,558 --> 00:05:32,960
Give a punch, receive a punch, this is super punch out.

95
00:05:33,646 --> 00:05:41,677
which is super fun, but it's not telling you really anything other than that you gave

96
00:05:41,717 --> 00:05:45,743
a punch that was satisfying, but it's not helping you really bond with the mechanics

97
00:05:45,783 --> 00:05:46,163
of the world.

98
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:56,039
Further along in game design, we have now, again,

99
00:05:56,099 --> 00:05:59,143
because I'm doing mostly AAA kind of battle design,

100
00:06:00,064 --> 00:06:01,726
you have your assassination.

101
00:06:01,806 --> 00:06:03,228
So here's the strangulation.

102
00:06:03,508 --> 00:06:04,850
You have your kills from Red Dead.

103
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,312
And then, again, the satisfaction

104
00:06:06,352 --> 00:06:07,253
of killing splicers.

105
00:06:07,585 --> 00:06:15,892
It is satisfying in Red Dead, in particular, the kill sounds that you hear can be so dramatic

106
00:06:15,972 --> 00:06:22,978
and so pathetic, meaning that you kind of feel like an asshole for killing these people,

107
00:06:23,338 --> 00:06:25,980
which contributes again to his psychological state.

108
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:32,466
So you are, it's an enhancement, it's deeper, it's moving into creating emotional states

109
00:06:32,526 --> 00:06:35,909
for the player, but it is not yet.

110
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,906
Helping the player to understand that the particular feedback that they are

111
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:44,671
inputting into the engine is being reflected back to them.

112
00:06:45,231 --> 00:06:50,438
The way that we used to record these types of voiceover sound effects,

113
00:06:50,818 --> 00:06:53,281
we would record them as what we called a variety pack.

114
00:06:53,931 --> 00:06:56,892
So we would make diverse sounds for a single action.

115
00:06:57,292 --> 00:07:00,933
They were kind of catch-all, sort of an imprecise response.

116
00:07:01,233 --> 00:07:03,013
They're non-customizable in engine.

117
00:07:03,033 --> 00:07:09,635
You're not sure that, you know, let's say you have a bank of 20 sounds coming from a

118
00:07:09,735 --> 00:07:12,456
script like this, 20 strangle to deaths.

119
00:07:12,876 --> 00:07:13,656
So you have...

120
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,281
Maybe some wet ones, maybe some short ones, maybe some long ones.

121
00:07:18,882 --> 00:07:21,783
And the engine is going to randomly call them from the sound bank.

122
00:07:21,863 --> 00:07:23,804
And it's not necessarily always...

123
00:07:23,864 --> 00:07:28,527
Some people will key it to the art, but that's pretty complicated from an implementation

124
00:07:28,547 --> 00:07:29,107
standpoint.

125
00:07:29,988 --> 00:07:31,809
It's not necessarily always going to...

126
00:07:33,049 --> 00:07:34,249
Not really going to happen that much.

127
00:07:35,049 --> 00:07:37,330
It's a bank. It's going to pull from a bank.

128
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:40,751
You're going to get whatever kind of strangulation art that you're going to get.

129
00:07:41,011 --> 00:07:43,731
You're going to get a random strangulation kind of sound that you're going to get.

130
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:46,092
Maybe they're going to match. Maybe not.

131
00:07:46,892 --> 00:07:51,993
But it's great that we used to do it this way because we didn't want to tire the player's ear.

132
00:07:52,533 --> 00:07:56,634
So we would always say we want to do a huge batch of a lot of different things

133
00:07:56,914 --> 00:07:58,494
so that the player doesn't feel...

134
00:07:59,257 --> 00:08:02,822
By hearing the same punch sound all the time, the same strangulation sound all the time.

135
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,104
And we did that mostly due to space limitations,

136
00:08:08,484 --> 00:08:10,446
engine limitations, processing limitations.

137
00:08:10,966 --> 00:08:14,489
So now, as we're moving forward, kind of a year or two ago,

138
00:08:15,811 --> 00:08:18,353
with this particular game as an example,

139
00:08:18,393 --> 00:08:19,534
but with a lot of other games,

140
00:08:20,615 --> 00:08:24,198
you'll see that people are able to create

141
00:08:24,258 --> 00:08:27,661
what I call bespoke or custom-tailored interactions.

142
00:08:28,042 --> 00:08:29,623
So we'll have something where...

143
00:08:30,064 --> 00:08:36,726
It's not just a punch, but it's a combination of things that the player is putting in, and

144
00:08:36,786 --> 00:08:38,927
then the game engine is reflecting back.

145
00:08:39,007 --> 00:08:41,308
So the player is saying, well, I want to kill this guy.

146
00:08:41,548 --> 00:08:45,910
It's not just that I'm stabbing him, it's that I'm kneeing him in the crotch, and I'm

147
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:48,191
hitting him with the elbow, and then I'm beheading him.

148
00:08:48,631 --> 00:08:50,472
Or some variety of...

149
00:08:53,240 --> 00:09:01,786
Does it sound like I like my job?

150
00:09:02,187 --> 00:09:10,973
So, what we want is, we want people to learn how to play the game in a way that is supported by the sound design that we are giving them.

151
00:09:11,354 --> 00:09:17,878
So we want to create a sound bank that is going to have a highly, highly specific, very

152
00:09:18,098 --> 00:09:24,183
small sound that is going to tag exactly to the animation that they're going to receive.

153
00:09:24,423 --> 00:09:27,665
So when you have this, let's say you're going to elbow someone in the neck.

154
00:09:28,606 --> 00:09:32,250
It can't be what we used to do with our variety pack.

155
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:37,896
It can't be like 10 or 20 different, well, maybe I'm elbowing in the neck and it's wet.

156
00:09:37,936 --> 00:09:38,677
Maybe it's dry.

157
00:09:38,717 --> 00:09:39,538
Maybe it's raining.

158
00:09:39,578 --> 00:09:41,040
Maybe it's, you know, all these different things.

159
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,865
We had to figure out a way to create a really, really specific script.

160
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,287
that our actors could do.

161
00:09:47,567 --> 00:09:52,231
So then every one of those individual pieces in the engine

162
00:09:53,452 --> 00:09:56,675
would be consistent and would always reflect back

163
00:09:56,815 --> 00:09:58,997
exactly what the art was gonna do.

164
00:10:00,498 --> 00:10:01,819
Again, why is this good?

165
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:03,060
Because believe it or not,

166
00:10:03,481 --> 00:10:05,643
we did have to have these discussions.

167
00:10:06,844 --> 00:10:07,864
Looking at haptic feedback

168
00:10:07,925 --> 00:10:10,427
or looking at gyroscopic feedback as we're moving into VR,

169
00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:25,411
It's awesome and it's great and it gives you information, but it doesn't give you the kind of finely tuned information that I want to provide to the player so that the player understands exactly what they're doing and they're learning through sound.

170
00:10:26,211 --> 00:10:41,293
League, amazing, the art is fantastic, it helps you, but we could do better. And that's what I'm always looking at, is how can we do things better, how can we support the player so that they are understanding what they're doing and having a more satisfying experience.

171
00:10:42,946 --> 00:10:46,569
Accurate, immediate reinforcing feedback between the player and the game.

172
00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:49,812
You have here's your instruction set. You want to make sure

173
00:10:49,832 --> 00:10:54,135
that when you are giving an instruction, the engine is saying

174
00:10:54,175 --> 00:10:58,118
yes, I understand. You want to make sure that what you're going to get back is

175
00:10:58,178 --> 00:10:59,900
this, not that.

176
00:11:02,735 --> 00:11:03,876
So how do we do that?

177
00:11:04,556 --> 00:11:07,939
We talked about voiceover sound effects, creating audio pieces.

178
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:13,925
A script is this kind of sample.

179
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,207
And it was interesting.

180
00:11:16,807 --> 00:11:18,229
I used For Honor as an example.

181
00:11:18,289 --> 00:11:20,270
There's a couple of other games coming up

182
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:22,312
where we've used the same model because.

183
00:11:22,733 --> 00:11:26,514
We have so much more processing power and so much more customization available to us.

184
00:11:27,874 --> 00:11:33,876
The actors are really accustomed to Variety Pack because we've been doing it for so long.

185
00:11:34,096 --> 00:11:38,458
So it was really hard for them to kind of be reminded at every take, no, you have to

186
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:39,038
do it the same.

187
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:39,978
The same.

188
00:11:40,338 --> 00:11:40,638
The same.

189
00:11:41,058 --> 00:11:41,459
Every time.

190
00:11:41,499 --> 00:11:44,980
And they're like, ugh, it's so, okay, I'll do it the same.

191
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:47,261
And they would, and they would do it.

192
00:11:47,421 --> 00:11:51,225
And what was interesting, and this is a conversation for another time,

193
00:11:51,285 --> 00:11:55,530
but the Western kind of European language model,

194
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:58,212
because it's not a tone-based language,

195
00:11:58,553 --> 00:12:01,195
and it's not dependent upon absolute...

196
00:12:01,465 --> 00:12:03,507
perfect tonal consistency every time.

197
00:12:03,927 --> 00:12:06,649
What we learned in doing this is that the actors,

198
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:10,633
even if they're doing the same specific length for the same tiny thing,

199
00:12:10,953 --> 00:12:15,597
there will always be a tiny little micro variation in their voice.

200
00:12:15,957 --> 00:12:20,681
So it doesn't tire the ear, and when you paste everything together,

201
00:12:21,161 --> 00:12:24,263
it actually worked, which was really, really neat.

202
00:12:24,384 --> 00:12:28,627
And as we were watching players playing the game, they would say,

203
00:12:29,338 --> 00:12:31,379
There was one particular person I was watching and they said,

204
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:33,760
oh, that's a move.

205
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,620
I'm like, yeah, that's a move.

206
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,020
They're like, oh, well, wait.

207
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,581
And I can do, and now, and to watch them learn and watch

208
00:12:40,621 --> 00:12:44,122
them learn through sound was really exciting for me.

209
00:12:44,202 --> 00:12:47,003
And it made me feel as though we could give them a lot more

210
00:12:47,043 --> 00:12:49,243
to work with and help them understand their tools.

211
00:12:50,263 --> 00:12:52,224
So very short talk.

212
00:12:52,724 --> 00:12:54,304
Each element is a building block.

213
00:12:55,105 --> 00:12:56,005
Enough building blocks.

214
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:57,925
Great, infinite customization.

215
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:00,059
by mixing them up.

216
00:13:04,421 --> 00:13:07,062
And it creates a more responsive world.

217
00:13:07,442 --> 00:13:10,943
It creates a greater bond with the world, which is the thing that I'm always after,

218
00:13:11,403 --> 00:13:14,765
and the greater bond is greater satisfaction and happier players.

219
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:16,725
That's why we do what we do.

220
00:13:16,745 --> 00:13:17,145
Yay.

221
00:13:17,165 --> 00:13:17,486
That is my talk.

222
00:13:17,506 --> 00:13:18,186
Thank you.

223
00:13:18,226 --> 00:13:18,486
Thank you.

224
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:18,686
Thank you.

225
00:13:18,706 --> 00:13:20,567
Thank you.

226
00:13:20,587 --> 00:13:21,367
Thank you.

227
00:13:21,387 --> 00:13:21,667
Thank you.

228
00:13:21,807 --> 00:13:22,767
Thank you.

229
00:13:22,867 --> 00:13:23,488
Thank you.

230
00:13:23,508 --> 00:13:23,688
Thank you.

231
00:13:27,753 --> 00:13:29,654
So, my talk is super, super short.

232
00:13:29,714 --> 00:13:34,096
So, if you guys want to talk about anything else, I can answer your questions, or you

233
00:13:34,116 --> 00:13:35,096
can all go get coffee.

234
00:13:35,116 --> 00:13:36,577
All right.

235
00:13:36,597 --> 00:13:36,857
Coffee time.

236
00:13:36,877 --> 00:13:39,658
Oh, wait, you have a question.

237
00:13:40,359 --> 00:13:40,559
Oh, yeah.

238
00:13:40,579 --> 00:13:40,779
Great talk.

239
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:41,199
Perfect length.

240
00:13:41,219 --> 00:13:41,619
Oh, thank you.

241
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:42,139
Could be longer.

242
00:13:42,359 --> 00:13:42,540
I'm sorry.

243
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:42,780
I'm sorry.

244
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,080
I'm sorry.

245
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:43,560
I'm sorry.

246
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:43,880
I'm sorry.

247
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:49,263
I'm sorry.

248
00:13:49,283 --> 00:13:49,463
I'm sorry.

249
00:13:49,483 --> 00:13:49,743
I'm sorry.

250
00:13:49,763 --> 00:13:49,963
I'm sorry.

251
00:13:49,983 --> 00:13:50,163
I'm sorry.

252
00:13:50,283 --> 00:13:50,483
I'm sorry.

253
00:13:50,503 --> 00:13:50,703
I'm sorry.

254
00:13:50,723 --> 00:13:50,903
I'm sorry.

255
00:13:50,943 --> 00:13:51,163
I'm sorry.

256
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,142
I would like to come up with two questions. How has this changed your casting?

257
00:13:55,203 --> 00:14:00,669
Are you looking at actors who maybe can't do 10 very similar variations of 100 different moves?

258
00:14:00,929 --> 00:14:03,492
Or do you try to train people into it? Or is there a point where you're sort of like,

259
00:14:03,973 --> 00:14:06,696
okay, we have to try something different when we're sending out sides or auditions?

260
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:07,861
Oh, that's a great question.

261
00:14:08,082 --> 00:14:10,604
So the question is, how has this changed my approach to casting?

262
00:14:11,405 --> 00:14:13,427
Am I having a difficult time with people

263
00:14:13,487 --> 00:14:18,012
who are unable to conform to the kind of new,

264
00:14:18,032 --> 00:14:20,815
it could be perceived as a limitation,

265
00:14:20,855 --> 00:14:22,697
or it could be perceived as greater freedom.

266
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:30,563
It hasn't really changed my approach to casting, but it has changed my approach to working

267
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:31,684
with the actors in the studio.

268
00:14:31,964 --> 00:14:37,907
It is definitely something that I need to train them into, and it's a little bit difficult

269
00:14:37,987 --> 00:14:42,530
because they are, depending on, you know, some actors are trained to do three in a row,

270
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:45,672
some actors are trained to, for every...

271
00:14:47,185 --> 00:14:49,986
One in the three in a row, they're trained to give you something different.

272
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:53,667
Some actors are like, I'll do your three in a row.

273
00:14:54,288 --> 00:14:55,248
Each one will be different.

274
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:57,229
Hopefully it'll be something that you like.

275
00:14:57,429 --> 00:15:00,110
Then you have other actors who are more method style actors and

276
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,951
they'll say, I'll give you three in a row.

277
00:15:02,331 --> 00:15:06,993
Each one is aiming for a particular level of emotional truth.

278
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:08,753
And I'm just trying to get there.

279
00:15:09,133 --> 00:15:12,555
So for this item, because it is really simple, we train them.

280
00:15:13,795 --> 00:15:14,336
Fantastic, thanks.

281
00:15:14,656 --> 00:15:15,236
Yep, thanks.

282
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:24,181
Actually, continuing that question, in the VO session,

283
00:15:24,201 --> 00:15:27,582
do you have strategies for getting to that point?

284
00:15:27,762 --> 00:15:30,303
Would you go through a bunch of different variations

285
00:15:30,343 --> 00:15:31,523
until you hit the thing that you want,

286
00:15:32,103 --> 00:15:33,203
and then do that 10 times?

287
00:15:33,384 --> 00:15:34,724
Or how do you handle that?

288
00:15:34,844 --> 00:15:35,704
Oh, that's super smart.

289
00:15:35,824 --> 00:15:36,524
That's a great question.

290
00:15:36,764 --> 00:15:39,225
So the question is, continuing on to that,

291
00:15:39,325 --> 00:15:41,126
when we are in the recording studio,

292
00:15:41,266 --> 00:15:43,986
if we are training someone, an actor,

293
00:15:44,086 --> 00:15:45,607
in how to do this correctly, or how

294
00:15:45,627 --> 00:15:48,548
to do it in a way that gives us material that we want.

295
00:15:51,413 --> 00:15:53,074
I'm trying to think of how to phrase it.

296
00:15:54,535 --> 00:15:59,317
Do we have them try it until we get something that we like, and then we have them do that

297
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:02,318
thing that we like ten times, or do we just kind of let them go?

298
00:16:02,739 --> 00:16:07,681
And we have them do it until we get the thing that we like, and then we have them do that

299
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:08,681
five to ten times.

300
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:09,922
Hi.

301
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:10,102
Hi.

302
00:16:10,162 --> 00:16:10,262
Hi.

303
00:16:11,022 --> 00:16:11,183
Hi.

304
00:16:11,223 --> 00:16:11,303
Hi.

305
00:16:11,323 --> 00:16:11,363
Hi.

306
00:16:11,383 --> 00:16:11,443
Hi.

307
00:16:11,483 --> 00:16:11,543
Hi.

308
00:16:11,563 --> 00:16:11,603
Hi.

309
00:16:11,623 --> 00:16:11,663
Hi.

310
00:16:11,683 --> 00:16:11,723
Hi.

311
00:16:11,743 --> 00:16:11,783
Hi.

312
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:15,101
Thanks for your talk, it brings up a lot of questions.

313
00:16:15,321 --> 00:16:20,426
We've had the same issue as you, we're looking for consistency or repetition.

314
00:16:21,107 --> 00:16:25,071
So what we started doing is actually writing out onomatopoeias and a bunch of them.

315
00:16:25,331 --> 00:16:30,696
So like who, and ha, and he, and same thing with case, and same thing with...

316
00:16:31,497 --> 00:16:35,920
These are even right up silent onomatopoeias or closed mouth.

317
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,883
And so we have this list that we've been using on multiple games

318
00:16:40,363 --> 00:16:42,284
with all of these written out onomatopoeias,

319
00:16:42,344 --> 00:16:47,528
which makes it really easy for the actors to repeat that one specific onomatopoeia.

320
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:51,611
And once all of that is done, then we'll go through them

321
00:16:51,771 --> 00:16:54,473
and see what we recorded applies to what action

322
00:16:54,633 --> 00:16:58,696
instead of being action-driven onomatopoeias.

323
00:16:59,076 --> 00:17:00,337
That's a great approach.

324
00:17:01,005 --> 00:17:05,191
So I was wondering if you had tried this and if it worked,

325
00:17:05,271 --> 00:17:07,373
because I've constantly been wondering,

326
00:17:07,413 --> 00:17:08,835
should I go more for...

327
00:17:09,817 --> 00:17:11,399
When I tell an actor to kick,

328
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:13,722
I get that same problem that you've been getting.

329
00:17:13,822 --> 00:17:16,125
They do whatever, and then it gets really hard

330
00:17:16,165 --> 00:17:17,567
to get consistent acting.

331
00:17:18,368 --> 00:17:22,991
Yeah, I think that's a fantastic approach. I haven't specifically tried that, writing

332
00:17:23,091 --> 00:17:28,554
out the onomatopoeias on my stuff. I've seen, there is a great, I don't know if he's here,

333
00:17:28,574 --> 00:17:35,397
there's a great sound designer at Ubisoft who has, I've seen, do some similar things

334
00:17:35,417 --> 00:17:41,361
like that. I think it's a fantastic approach. Restating, he is actually writing out the

335
00:17:41,401 --> 00:17:47,344
onomatopoeias on the script and then gathering a library of specific sounds.

336
00:17:47,664 --> 00:17:53,668
and then seeing where they fit the art instead of doing it the way that we've been doing

337
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:57,871
it which is to kind of look at the art and then try to have the actor create something.

338
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:02,073
So he's kind of out ahead of the process.

339
00:18:02,253 --> 00:18:03,474
I think that's super, super awesome.

340
00:18:03,494 --> 00:18:04,695
It works really, really well.

341
00:18:05,175 --> 00:18:09,158
And just to add something else that I do is what we do is we write all of these on a

342
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:10,338
shared screen.

343
00:18:11,199 --> 00:18:15,222
So that's in our recording console computer.

344
00:18:15,623 --> 00:18:17,124
We share the screen in the vocal booth.

345
00:18:17,644 --> 00:18:19,526
So as they're doing what they're doing,

346
00:18:19,586 --> 00:18:23,749
if they do something quite different that sounds like an onomatopoeia that it can write,

347
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,271
I'll add that to my list.

348
00:18:25,651 --> 00:18:28,113
So I keep track of all the written onomatopoeias.

349
00:18:28,433 --> 00:18:31,836
And sometimes when they go randomly, I'll take notes of exactly how it sounds.

350
00:18:31,936 --> 00:18:32,917
It's much easier to track.

351
00:18:33,277 --> 00:18:34,659
So it's just an idea I'm throwing out.

352
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:36,580
I love this idea. It's wonderful. Yay!

353
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:39,643
Do you guys want me to restate it or you guys all heard it?

354
00:18:40,822 --> 00:18:43,762
Yeah, okay, great. Yeah, that's fabulous. Thank you so much.

355
00:18:43,782 --> 00:18:49,004
Hi, I'm an audio student at Cogswell and I actually had a question.

356
00:18:50,224 --> 00:18:53,285
What percentage of game audio requires the use of JavaScript?

357
00:18:53,385 --> 00:18:56,986
Because I'm learning a little bit about JavaScript and I was wondering if I should really pursue

358
00:18:57,526 --> 00:19:01,527
like the, you know, learning how to script, you know, more advanced.

359
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:06,109
That is a fabulous question and I wish that I knew the answer to it.

360
00:19:06,189 --> 00:19:07,169
Oh, okay.

361
00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:08,830
I'm sorry that I don't.

362
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:13,135
The question was how much of what percentage of game audio requires JavaScript and is it

363
00:19:13,216 --> 00:19:18,442
worthwhile for a student to spend a lot of time learning that so they can use it as a

364
00:19:18,482 --> 00:19:22,847
tool and I'm really, really sorry but I just do not know the answer.

365
00:19:22,887 --> 00:19:23,128
Thank you.

366
00:19:26,927 --> 00:19:29,670
Hi, so I'm pretty new to game audio and everything,

367
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:32,553
and especially unfamiliar with voiceover and everything.

368
00:19:32,633 --> 00:19:35,796
So you're talking about getting real consistency

369
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:37,197
and everything in the voiceovers.

370
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:40,120
And I would imagine, like, say in a fight scene, for example,

371
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,683
or a fight two wins, you'd have a lot of,

372
00:19:44,004 --> 00:19:46,046
like, you'd get hit in the same place,

373
00:19:46,106 --> 00:19:47,447
but you'd have a lot of variation

374
00:19:47,467 --> 00:19:48,828
because they're not going to grunt the same way.

375
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:51,070
So why do you want that consistency?

376
00:19:52,151 --> 00:19:52,252
Oh.

377
00:19:53,022 --> 00:19:58,203
I'd like the consistency so that, well, there's always going to be, because again, we're not

378
00:19:58,443 --> 00:20:02,924
working in a tone-based language here in the production that we're doing in the U.S., we

379
00:20:02,944 --> 00:20:04,125
want that consistency.

380
00:20:04,445 --> 00:20:08,506
So then the player, this is a fantastic, so the question is, why do we want consistency?

381
00:20:08,826 --> 00:20:10,247
If somebody is getting kicked.

382
00:20:10,587 --> 00:20:14,694
Why are we moving away from the concept of a variety pack?

383
00:20:14,974 --> 00:20:20,563
And the answer is because we want it to always be the same sound.

384
00:20:20,983 --> 00:20:24,068
So that little portion, it's like saying...

385
00:20:25,746 --> 00:20:33,153
that we're going to, let's say we have a particular set of moves, we want the player to understand

386
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:40,059
that that is the sound of a kick. So that is what a small kick sounds like. So then

387
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:45,063
when the player is doing the particular input on the controller for a small kick, they hear,

388
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:45,123
oh.

389
00:20:46,685 --> 00:20:48,686
The engine, I did the controller right,

390
00:20:49,347 --> 00:20:51,589
the engine understood that I wanted a small kick

391
00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:53,551
and the engine is giving me a small kick.

392
00:20:54,031 --> 00:20:55,913
So it's more about like the player input

393
00:20:55,993 --> 00:20:58,935
opposed to like kind of player feedback

394
00:20:58,975 --> 00:21:00,737
and experiencing that, something like that?

395
00:21:01,353 --> 00:21:07,699
It's so that the player understands that, so it's basically so that the engine is telling

396
00:21:07,739 --> 00:21:10,621
them I received your command correctly.

397
00:21:11,022 --> 00:21:12,623
It's basically just an echo back.

398
00:21:13,244 --> 00:21:18,188
And in order to, if it was, if we were still working in binary, like if we were doing super

399
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:23,112
punch out and it was the same thing all the time, like oh my god, it would be super boring

400
00:21:23,152 --> 00:21:23,533
and sucky.

401
00:21:24,293 --> 00:21:31,017
This only works when you are working in sort of a for-honor environment or an upcoming environment

402
00:21:31,337 --> 00:21:34,479
where you're creating or stitching together bespoke things.

403
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:41,444
It would not be awesome if you were working in Super Punch-Out because it would be super boring.

404
00:21:41,864 --> 00:21:42,164
Thank you.

405
00:21:42,284 --> 00:21:42,564
Thank you.

406
00:21:46,473 --> 00:21:47,413
Hi, thanks for your talk.

407
00:21:48,013 --> 00:21:50,934
So it sounds like you're talking about shorter asset length?

408
00:21:50,954 --> 00:21:51,254
Correct.

409
00:21:51,674 --> 00:21:52,474
Yeah, absolutely.

410
00:21:53,435 --> 00:21:55,655
That flow together and sort of fight combos?

411
00:21:55,675 --> 00:21:56,835
Exactly.

412
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:58,936
Not a button masher kind of a situation,

413
00:21:58,976 --> 00:22:02,837
but how do you feel that that changes?

414
00:22:02,897 --> 00:22:04,717
Like if something needs to get changed

415
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:06,538
in terms of an animation, like the timing

416
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:07,658
needs to get changed or something,

417
00:22:08,478 --> 00:22:11,559
do you feel like that makes it easier

418
00:22:11,659 --> 00:22:13,199
to kind of roll with those kinds of changes?

419
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:13,820
Or is it?

420
00:22:14,594 --> 00:22:15,995
That's a great question.

421
00:22:16,255 --> 00:22:18,776
The question is, what happens after you record all of these

422
00:22:18,836 --> 00:22:21,417
teeny tiny sounds that are going to be pieced together

423
00:22:21,477 --> 00:22:23,738
and make your little Lego dragon or your Lego Millennium

424
00:22:23,778 --> 00:22:28,020
Falcon or whatever, and the animation changes?

425
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:32,812
I don't know that it necessarily makes it easier or harder.

426
00:22:32,832 --> 00:22:38,457
I don't think that those things, I think you probably are faced with a re-record.

427
00:22:39,297 --> 00:22:39,558
Okay.

428
00:22:39,598 --> 00:22:40,759
Which sucks, but that's.

429
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:41,359
Sure.

430
00:22:41,379 --> 00:22:42,440
If you want to do it right, yeah.

431
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,020
Okay.

432
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:43,781
It's a good question.

433
00:22:43,801 --> 00:22:44,241
Thank you.

434
00:22:44,482 --> 00:22:44,742
Thanks.

435
00:22:46,623 --> 00:22:46,763
Hi.

436
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:54,305
So, one of the things I really appreciate about what you're talking about is the implicit

437
00:22:54,766 --> 00:22:55,827
accessibility advantages.

438
00:22:56,867 --> 00:23:06,215
Any time that what the player does corresponds uniquely to what they hear has inherent advantages

439
00:23:06,275 --> 00:23:12,981
for any blind or low vision gamers who otherwise aren't getting that reinforcement from what

440
00:23:13,001 --> 00:23:13,461
they're playing.

441
00:23:13,681 --> 00:23:16,003
So, a little bit of icing on the cake.

442
00:23:16,505 --> 00:23:21,131
That is amazing. Thank you very much. The comment is that this really helps accessibility

443
00:23:21,251 --> 00:23:26,538
for low vision people or people who are blind who are playing the game. I hadn't even thought

444
00:23:26,558 --> 00:23:29,101
of that and that is an incredible thing to say. Thank you.

445
00:23:29,121 --> 00:23:29,622
It's a really good thing.

446
00:23:33,788 --> 00:23:58,248
Hi, so I was kind of thinking, I did see that the direction that you had for some actors was, you know, like, we're going to do the same sound with with variance 10 times, but also at the same time with consistency. With the advent of middleware now, you know, like really running inside games, in particular, you know, like, especially at the triple A level.

447
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:04,555
How often is it, because I'm sure that not all 10 assets are going to be used.

448
00:24:05,215 --> 00:24:13,464
So how often is it that you would put a randomizer in terms of pitch and volume to substitute out and kind of get rid of that monotony?

449
00:24:15,552 --> 00:24:19,434
Well, I think that for this particular, it's a good question. So the question is,

450
00:24:19,894 --> 00:24:25,496
if I'm understanding it correctly, would we then use middleware in order to try

451
00:24:25,516 --> 00:24:31,699
to create variance? Is that in order to create variance to avoid sort of audio

452
00:24:31,819 --> 00:24:38,222
monotony in the particular sound? For this specific practice, I don't think

453
00:24:38,322 --> 00:24:39,502
that we would.

454
00:24:40,643 --> 00:24:44,846
Because we rely on the actor's natural kind of organic,

455
00:24:46,347 --> 00:24:49,609
tiny variation in order to do it.

456
00:24:49,709 --> 00:24:51,290
So yeah, I'm not sure that we would.

457
00:24:51,891 --> 00:24:54,413
Some other people might, and it might be amazing.

458
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:56,234
For us in practice, we haven't done that.

459
00:24:56,334 --> 00:24:57,595
But it's a good question, thank you.

460
00:24:57,695 --> 00:24:58,415
Great, thank you so much.

461
00:25:01,037 --> 00:25:01,638
Hey, thanks a lot.

462
00:25:02,648 --> 00:25:08,292
So the question I have is, does this approach change at all for working with creatures or

463
00:25:08,532 --> 00:25:11,254
more monster type and less humanoid creatures?

464
00:25:11,794 --> 00:25:13,195
Wow that's a fantastic question.

465
00:25:15,176 --> 00:25:16,477
Gosh I don't know.

466
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:19,139
I guess it would depend on if you were playing the creature.

467
00:25:19,639 --> 00:25:26,023
I think if you were playing the creature as like some sort of giant thing that would have

468
00:25:26,123 --> 00:25:30,726
multiple moves that would be stitched together where it would be, where the player would

469
00:25:30,826 --> 00:25:31,747
need to understand.

470
00:25:32,227 --> 00:25:34,228
that what the direction they've given to the creature.

471
00:25:34,769 --> 00:25:37,871
I think if it's a playable creature character,

472
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:39,192
God, that would be fun.

473
00:25:42,395 --> 00:25:44,496
So, yeah, that's a fantasy.

474
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:44,937
Pardon?

475
00:25:44,957 --> 00:25:48,339
It was a devious laugh.

476
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,881
Yeah, that is a great question.

477
00:25:50,921 --> 00:25:52,583
I think if it's playable, sure.

478
00:25:52,603 --> 00:25:53,583
Cool.

479
00:25:53,663 --> 00:25:55,825
And I did get the five minute thing,

480
00:25:55,865 --> 00:25:57,847
so thank you very, very much everyone.

481
00:25:57,867 --> 00:25:59,108
I really appreciate your time.
