1
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:08,871
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:08,871 --> 00:00:11,893
All right, we're going to go ahead and get started.

3
00:00:11,893 --> 00:00:13,714
Quick warning, some things in this talk

4
00:00:13,714 --> 00:00:15,835
might be considered spoilers.

5
00:00:15,835 --> 00:00:17,396
Also, please do not record the talk,

6
00:00:17,396 --> 00:00:19,057
and please fill out your talk evaluation

7
00:00:19,057 --> 00:00:21,018
that you'll be sent over email.

8
00:00:21,018 --> 00:00:24,079
A copy of this talk will be available on Gorilla's website

9
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:25,420
after the conference.

10
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,601
So you'll be able to download this presentation

11
00:00:27,601 --> 00:00:29,342
if you want to see it, rather than

12
00:00:29,342 --> 00:00:31,423
having to take pictures of every slide or something like that.

13
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:35,492
The title of this talk is Balancing Action in RPG

14
00:00:35,492 --> 00:00:39,855
and Horizon Zero Dawn's Quests.

15
00:00:39,855 --> 00:00:42,137
So how much is Horizon an action game

16
00:00:42,137 --> 00:00:44,698
and how much is it an open-world RPG?

17
00:00:44,698 --> 00:00:47,480
Truthfully, I can't answer that question.

18
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,402
We never drew a line in the sand and said,

19
00:00:50,402 --> 00:00:54,244
yep, this is it, this is the perfect balance.

20
00:00:54,244 --> 00:00:56,326
When I talk about finding the balance,

21
00:00:56,326 --> 00:00:58,747
I'm gonna talk about my own experiences searching for it.

22
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,673
the open-world RPG concepts I applied during development that worked,

23
00:01:02,673 --> 00:01:06,196
and the action and gun concepts I had to learn, sometimes painfully.

24
00:01:06,196 --> 00:01:09,399
Here's an outline of the talk.

25
00:01:09,399 --> 00:01:12,983
First, I'm going to describe my background a bit,

26
00:01:12,983 --> 00:01:16,526
and that'll give you some context for what I brought to Guerrilla and to Horizon.

27
00:01:16,526 --> 00:01:21,711
Second, I'm going to walk you through an early vision of Horizon's quests.

28
00:01:23,405 --> 00:01:27,388
Third, I'm going to talk about open world quests versus what we call bunker quests

29
00:01:27,388 --> 00:01:31,371
and do a deep dive on two examples from Horizon to illustrate the differences

30
00:01:31,371 --> 00:01:33,133
in technique and approach we used for each.

31
00:01:33,133 --> 00:01:37,877
Fourth, I'm going to talk a bit about my own shortcomings and the things I learned

32
00:01:37,877 --> 00:01:40,819
from Guerrilla's institutional knowledge of action game level design.

33
00:01:40,819 --> 00:01:46,504
And fifth, I'm going to try to introduce some rules for thinking about balancing action in RPG.

34
00:01:46,504 --> 00:01:50,807
Lastly, I'm going to leave a little bit of time for questions,

35
00:01:50,807 --> 00:01:53,169
but if you want to, please come up after the talk.

36
00:01:53,529 --> 00:01:56,591
and ask me any questions you might have that we don't have time for.

37
00:01:56,591 --> 00:02:01,454
Hi, this is me. My name is Blake Rubichet.

38
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,236
I'm a senior quest designer at Guerrilla Games.

39
00:02:03,236 --> 00:02:08,700
I was hired in 2015 to join a new team that the studio leadership identified

40
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,422
would be necessary to supplement the design team that Guerrilla already had.

41
00:02:12,422 --> 00:02:14,924
That new team was the quest team.

42
00:02:14,924 --> 00:02:17,566
This team. This is the quest team at Guerrilla Games.

43
00:02:17,566 --> 00:02:18,307
Hi, guys.

44
00:02:20,502 --> 00:02:26,704
So prior to working at Guerrilla, I was a quest designer on the Elder Scrolls Online at ZeniMax Online Studios.

45
00:02:26,704 --> 00:02:30,685
ESO embraces the Bethesda model of open world RPGs like Skyrim and Fallout.

46
00:02:30,685 --> 00:02:36,907
Quest designers at Zoss write, design, and script their quests, but level design is a separate discipline entirely.

47
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:41,468
Before that, I was a world builder on Star Wars The Old Republic at BioWare Austin.

48
00:02:41,468 --> 00:02:44,469
Old Republic is a take on the BioWare model of RPGs.

49
00:02:44,469 --> 00:02:48,210
Again, we had separate level designers or architects at BioWare.

50
00:02:49,332 --> 00:02:55,496
The common theme here as far as what I brought to the table is that my experience was scripting, narrative design, and quest design, not level design.

51
00:02:55,496 --> 00:03:00,400
I arrived at this production with swinging into full gear.

52
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,704
Horizon had a very strong, very compelling vision, but one that didn't fully encompass the game we ended up making.

53
00:03:05,704 --> 00:03:11,768
Majestic wilderness, awe-inspiring machines, and exotic tribes.

54
00:03:11,768 --> 00:03:16,471
These were the aspects of the game that drove our early design thinking.

55
00:03:16,471 --> 00:03:17,912
And let's not forget Aloy, of course.

56
00:03:20,031 --> 00:03:21,812
But what about quests?

57
00:03:21,812 --> 00:03:24,395
That's what my team had been hired to make.

58
00:03:24,395 --> 00:03:26,176
What did quests look like in the world of Horizon?

59
00:03:26,176 --> 00:03:29,559
Let me paint you a picture.

60
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:31,501
Evening.

61
00:03:31,501 --> 00:03:32,882
It's raining.

62
00:03:32,882 --> 00:03:35,564
Aloy wakes from unconsciousness, lying in a smoking crater.

63
00:03:35,564 --> 00:03:37,946
She stands, dazed, and starts moving

64
00:03:37,946 --> 00:03:39,407
towards a burning village in the distance.

65
00:03:39,407 --> 00:03:40,328
Aloy enters the village.

66
00:03:40,328 --> 00:03:42,770
Everywhere she looks, chaos reigns.

67
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,873
A villager approaches Aloy and begs her not

68
00:03:45,873 --> 00:03:48,655
to pursue the machine that attacked the village.

69
00:03:49,217 --> 00:03:50,178
It's too dangerous.

70
00:03:50,178 --> 00:03:55,202
Aloy being Aloy, she follows the path of destruction out of the village,

71
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:58,244
passing the bodies of Nora warriors slain by the beast.

72
00:03:58,244 --> 00:04:02,107
A herd of machines blocks her path.

73
00:04:02,107 --> 00:04:04,689
Aloy picks a machine off from the herd in the plain

74
00:04:04,689 --> 00:04:06,170
and overrides it, making it her mount.

75
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:11,394
Now with a ride, she makes haste to pursue the rampaging machine.

76
00:04:11,394 --> 00:04:13,635
Aloy catches up to the hunting party sent after the beast

77
00:04:13,635 --> 00:04:15,537
in the nearby mountains.

78
00:04:15,537 --> 00:04:16,918
All but one are dead.

79
00:04:17,811 --> 00:04:20,172
The last hunter tells Aloy to beware.

80
00:04:20,172 --> 00:04:20,813
The beast is near.

81
00:04:20,813 --> 00:04:25,215
From nearby, our quarry, the mighty Thunderjaw,

82
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,736
shrieks and attacks.

83
00:04:26,736 --> 00:04:29,077
Aloy engages with and defeats the machine in epic fashion.

84
00:04:29,077 --> 00:04:29,457
Pretty cool, right?

85
00:04:29,457 --> 00:04:37,401
This is an early illustrated version of the E3 trailer

86
00:04:37,401 --> 00:04:40,303
that we would eventually use to reveal Horizons to the world.

87
00:04:40,303 --> 00:04:44,125
This kind of quest I can understand and wrap my head

88
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:46,506
around, given my background in open world RPGs.

89
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:51,769
A quest like this is very similar to a quest like the Ice Giant in The Witcher 3.

90
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:56,772
Big monster destroys town, protagonist tracks monster, protagonist kills monster.

91
00:04:56,772 --> 00:04:58,573
I'm being reductive, but you get my point.

92
00:04:58,573 --> 00:05:04,837
This was my wheelhouse, but this was not exactly the kind of quests we ended up making.

93
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:08,099
This is the story I just told you.

94
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:12,662
There are many quests in Horizon similar to this, but almost half of the main story of

95
00:05:12,662 --> 00:05:14,023
Horizon differs.

96
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:18,468
That difference led to a lot of lessons for me on action game design.

97
00:05:18,468 --> 00:05:23,392
You'll notice that I bolded and underlined all the indications of place.

98
00:05:23,392 --> 00:05:28,396
There are no interiors in this story, and indeed, there were no interiors at all in the vertical slice of Horizon.

99
00:05:28,396 --> 00:05:32,579
These are the main quest chapters of Horizon.

100
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:37,422
The quests that I bolded are quests that take place at least partially in interiors.

101
00:05:37,422 --> 00:05:44,367
Seven out of 16, more than 40% of the main story of Horizon takes place at least partially in spaces we call bunkers.

102
00:05:45,334 --> 00:05:49,316
But what is a bunker and how does the design of one inform us about balancing action and RPG?

103
00:05:49,316 --> 00:05:56,459
As I mentioned, the early vision of Horizon focused a lot on exteriors, machines, and tribes,

104
00:05:56,459 --> 00:06:00,761
but we needed spaces in which to tell the stories of the old world.

105
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:02,502
Bunkers are those spaces.

106
00:06:02,502 --> 00:06:08,745
Whereas open-world quests in Horizon feature big outdoor spaces and combat against large, monstrous opponents,

107
00:06:08,745 --> 00:06:14,928
bunkers are relatively tight, linear interiors featuring cover-shooter combat against primarily human opponents.

108
00:06:17,022 --> 00:06:21,085
If open world quests resemble the quests in other open world RPGs,

109
00:06:21,085 --> 00:06:23,647
what do bunker quests resemble?

110
00:06:23,647 --> 00:06:24,248
I'll give you a hint.

111
00:06:24,248 --> 00:06:27,410
But more on that later.

112
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:32,754
To return to the theme of talk, each of these types of quests

113
00:06:32,754 --> 00:06:35,737
requires a different balance of action and RPG design thinking.

114
00:06:35,737 --> 00:06:38,619
Each required a specific set of tools and experience

115
00:06:38,619 --> 00:06:40,420
that didn't always completely overlap.

116
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:45,124
To illustrate all that, I'm going to talk about two quests specifically,

117
00:06:45,124 --> 00:06:46,585
Freeheap and the Grave Horde.

118
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,601
FreeHeap was one of the first side quests I pitched and built,

119
00:06:50,601 --> 00:06:53,122
and it was also a bit of an experiment.

120
00:06:53,122 --> 00:06:56,724
As I mentioned, I'd come from designing MMORPGs,

121
00:06:56,724 --> 00:06:59,645
and so did our quest design lead at the time.

122
00:06:59,645 --> 00:07:01,426
We wanted to see if we could build a quest using

123
00:07:01,426 --> 00:07:03,887
the same kind of structure we were accustomed to that

124
00:07:03,887 --> 00:07:05,547
would also work for Horizon.

125
00:07:05,547 --> 00:07:07,308
It was also a bit of an experiment

126
00:07:07,308 --> 00:07:09,949
on how open world we wanted our quests to be.

127
00:07:09,949 --> 00:07:12,970
This is what FreeHeap looks like today,

128
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,091
but it was not always so.

129
00:07:15,632 --> 00:07:17,954
Initially, we tried a very open quest concept.

130
00:07:17,954 --> 00:07:21,036
Three quest locations, each essentially a pocket level

131
00:07:21,036 --> 00:07:22,257
connected by the open world.

132
00:07:22,257 --> 00:07:25,099
A benefit of this type of open design

133
00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:26,740
is that it gives players a lot of options

134
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,902
for how they approach your quest and the challenges within it.

135
00:07:28,902 --> 00:07:32,084
Also, within the context of a multiplayer game,

136
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:35,306
it spreads your players out and it prevents bunching.

137
00:07:35,306 --> 00:07:37,108
Unfortunately, a major downside of this design

138
00:07:37,108 --> 00:07:39,609
is that players can bumble into the goings-on of your quest

139
00:07:39,609 --> 00:07:41,751
without realizing what is actually going on.

140
00:07:42,784 --> 00:07:45,745
Many open world RPGs suffer from this problem to some degree.

141
00:07:45,745 --> 00:07:49,847
One way we solved this problem on Elder Scrolls Online

142
00:07:49,847 --> 00:07:51,768
was to get the quest bestower to come to you.

143
00:07:51,768 --> 00:07:56,210
Whenever the player approached the vicinity of the quest,

144
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,151
some Yahoo would come running out of the distance,

145
00:07:58,151 --> 00:08:00,612
hey, I have something for you to do.

146
00:08:00,612 --> 00:08:02,934
This just didn't work for Horizon.

147
00:08:02,934 --> 00:08:05,815
As we developed the game, it became more and more cinematic.

148
00:08:05,815 --> 00:08:07,436
For any significant character,

149
00:08:07,436 --> 00:08:09,517
we wanted to stage their conversations,

150
00:08:09,517 --> 00:08:11,858
and we needed a definitive location for that.

151
00:08:13,345 --> 00:08:16,287
Case in point, the bestower for Freeheap, Petra.

152
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,207
Ha, I've calluses older than you.

153
00:08:17,207 --> 00:08:18,728
I've calluses enough if you want to test me.

154
00:08:18,728 --> 00:08:23,972
Ha, she sparks. I believe it, Flamehair. Petra Forge Woman.

155
00:08:23,972 --> 00:08:28,575
Uh, Aloy, Machine Hunter.

156
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:32,078
Mm, Machine Hunter, eh?

157
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:34,759
Huh, I could have a use for you.

158
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:42,285
Straight of it is, we're being muscled out of our own claims.

159
00:08:42,998 --> 00:08:46,699
That's why I've been working on this scrap-spitting beast.

160
00:08:46,699 --> 00:08:48,000
It's a dispute settler.

161
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,881
That conversation happens here in Freeheap,

162
00:08:52,881 --> 00:08:55,921
and it can really only happen in Freeheap because of the staging,

163
00:08:55,921 --> 00:08:59,922
the things that she references, the propping that needs to be there.

164
00:08:59,922 --> 00:09:04,903
We really wanted you to have a context of the situation in Freeheap,

165
00:09:04,903 --> 00:09:07,324
as regards the Banit camp or the Scrapper Den,

166
00:09:07,324 --> 00:09:09,484
the other locations in the quest,

167
00:09:09,484 --> 00:09:10,385
before you went there.

168
00:09:11,091 --> 00:09:14,272
So we employed a tried and true strategy.

169
00:09:14,272 --> 00:09:15,892
We added big damn walls.

170
00:09:15,892 --> 00:09:22,114
This is an MMO technique used to onboard open world quest

171
00:09:22,114 --> 00:09:23,234
and quest locations.

172
00:09:23,234 --> 00:09:25,675
Basically, you limit the number of approach angles

173
00:09:25,675 --> 00:09:27,255
and make sure all those vectors of approach

174
00:09:27,255 --> 00:09:28,436
lead to a quest bestower.

175
00:09:28,436 --> 00:09:32,817
But now with the added walls, we started

176
00:09:32,817 --> 00:09:34,037
to lose the open feeling of the quest.

177
00:09:34,037 --> 00:09:36,458
It became more and more like a linear level.

178
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:39,079
To combat this, we focused on the level design

179
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,539
of the transitional spaces.

180
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:45,073
This is an early gray box of the transitional space leading up to the banded area.

181
00:09:45,073 --> 00:09:49,156
Because we lost so many vectors of approach to this quest location,

182
00:09:49,156 --> 00:09:54,140
I wanted to maximize the variety of traversal options available to the player in the space.

183
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,162
We called this the Jungle Gym concept.

184
00:09:56,162 --> 00:10:01,386
These early paint overs emphasized the verticality, the route variety,

185
00:10:01,386 --> 00:10:06,170
and the range of movement options through the space.

186
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:10,354
If you saw David's talk earlier, he was talking about this as affordances.

187
00:10:10,782 --> 00:10:12,602
So we really loaded this area up.

188
00:10:12,602 --> 00:10:16,983
This is what it looks like today.

189
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:21,004
You can see if you have a look that there's

190
00:10:21,004 --> 00:10:24,224
a real variety of options presented to the player here.

191
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:25,985
We wanted to let them come to this bandit camp

192
00:10:25,985 --> 00:10:27,505
and get into it any way they wanted to.

193
00:10:27,505 --> 00:10:29,145
You'll see plenty of zip lines.

194
00:10:29,145 --> 00:10:30,906
You'll see tightropes.

195
00:10:30,906 --> 00:10:33,146
You'll see vertical options across the top.

196
00:10:33,146 --> 00:10:35,506
You'll see low options in through the gate.

197
00:10:35,506 --> 00:10:38,707
And tons and tons of affordances.

198
00:10:38,707 --> 00:10:40,267
Because we lost the vectors of approach.

199
00:10:40,769 --> 00:10:47,832
We still wanted to give players a sense of flexibility.

200
00:10:47,832 --> 00:10:51,394
This new, more closed design still offered the player a choice

201
00:10:51,394 --> 00:10:53,955
about which quest objective they wanted to accomplish first.

202
00:10:53,955 --> 00:10:57,396
But that too eventually fell to the wayside.

203
00:10:57,396 --> 00:11:00,338
Again, this was due to the fidelity of the story we wanted to tell.

204
00:11:00,338 --> 00:11:02,159
This is the quest today.

205
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:07,501
The quest has three acts, each of which correspond to a movement within the story,

206
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:08,722
an area, and an objective.

207
00:11:09,254 --> 00:11:11,436
The quest is bestowed here by Petra.

208
00:11:11,436 --> 00:11:16,440
Petra needs Aloy to recover some components she will use to restore a weapon she's working on.

209
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:22,225
Act 1 takes the player to the bandit den, where the human bandits have stashed stolen power cells.

210
00:11:22,225 --> 00:11:27,950
Aloy breaks in, takes the cells, and we foreshadow retribution by the bandits.

211
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:33,535
In Act 2, Aloy enters the lair of the scrappers and grabs the parts she needs from the scrapper piles.

212
00:11:33,535 --> 00:11:37,058
In Act 3, Aloy returns to the quest bestower.

213
00:11:37,735 --> 00:11:40,797
Petra to give her the collected power cells and parts.

214
00:11:40,797 --> 00:11:43,559
Petra uses the return materials to restore the weapon,

215
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:45,640
just as the bandits arrive and attack the town.

216
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,663
So here was the rub, and this is why we ended up

217
00:11:49,663 --> 00:11:50,944
going with a linear quest.

218
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:53,365
If you did the scrapper layer section first,

219
00:11:53,365 --> 00:11:55,787
and then the bandit hideout, it didn't make any sense

220
00:11:55,787 --> 00:11:57,969
that the bandits showed up immediately

221
00:11:57,969 --> 00:12:00,390
after this guy shook his fist at you and said,

222
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,011
we're going to come and get you.

223
00:12:02,011 --> 00:12:03,352
It wasn't as strong a story.

224
00:12:03,911 --> 00:12:05,932
So we eventually decided that we wanted you to go

225
00:12:05,932 --> 00:12:08,173
to the bannet layer first, and that's just the way

226
00:12:08,173 --> 00:12:09,333
that we directed you to do it.

227
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:14,435
This narrative structure naturally suggests a looping flow,

228
00:12:14,435 --> 00:12:16,196
so we built a special one-way shortcut

229
00:12:16,196 --> 00:12:20,297
from the scrapper layer back to Freeheap to facilitate that.

230
00:12:20,297 --> 00:12:21,498
Why?

231
00:12:21,498 --> 00:12:22,758
Because backtracking is the devil.

232
00:12:22,758 --> 00:12:26,060
The problem was players never used it.

233
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,180
They didn't know it was there.

234
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,041
What we needed and we didn't have the time

235
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,222
was a breadcrumbing system, so we built one.

236
00:12:33,284 --> 00:12:35,246
Very importantly, there was a talk earlier today

237
00:12:35,246 --> 00:12:36,407
that talked about breadcrumbing.

238
00:12:36,407 --> 00:12:39,509
And I think this is a very good time

239
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:41,531
to point out the differences between action and RPG

240
00:12:41,531 --> 00:12:43,973
because in action games, breadcrumbing literally

241
00:12:43,973 --> 00:12:46,775
means placing little objects along the path

242
00:12:46,775 --> 00:12:48,376
to lead you somewhere.

243
00:12:48,376 --> 00:12:50,458
When we talk about it in terms of open world RPGs,

244
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:52,800
we usually mean a system like this.

245
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,943
So in World and on the compass, we add these markers

246
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:59,245
and we literally tell you where to go.

247
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:01,487
It routes you along roads, it routes you to doors.

248
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,900
and I'm going to explain a little bit about how that works

249
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:10,242
because it's very important in the context of an open world game.

250
00:13:10,242 --> 00:13:12,582
Let me share with you some images from the design doc

251
00:13:12,582 --> 00:13:15,063
I wrote for this system three years ago.

252
00:13:15,063 --> 00:13:16,043
As you can see, I am an artist.

253
00:13:16,043 --> 00:13:18,864
If a quest objective takes place in a space

254
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:20,704
with a discrete number of entrances

255
00:13:20,704 --> 00:13:22,784
and the player is outside of that space,

256
00:13:22,784 --> 00:13:25,505
the breadcrumbing system will point you to a valid entrance

257
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:26,765
into that space, like so.

258
00:13:28,287 --> 00:13:29,888
We do that with a marker like this.

259
00:13:29,888 --> 00:13:32,388
Important point, a door in this context

260
00:13:32,388 --> 00:13:34,949
is a crack in a wall, a ladder, whatever.

261
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:36,389
It doesn't have to literally be a door,

262
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:37,449
it's just an entrance into the space.

263
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:40,810
A level in the traditional sense

264
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:42,551
doesn't have to worry about stuff like this

265
00:13:42,551 --> 00:13:44,271
because it is a bounded concept.

266
00:13:44,271 --> 00:13:45,531
A level starts and a level ends

267
00:13:45,531 --> 00:13:47,832
and everything in the middle is the level.

268
00:13:47,832 --> 00:13:50,813
In an open-world quest, you can go in,

269
00:13:50,813 --> 00:13:53,353
go halfway through, decide you wanna go somewhere else,

270
00:13:53,353 --> 00:13:54,554
get something else, power up,

271
00:13:54,554 --> 00:13:56,094
and then you have to find your way back.

272
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,431
That's why a breadcrumbing system is really vital

273
00:13:58,431 --> 00:13:59,672
in an open world context.

274
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:03,575
So this is what I did.

275
00:14:03,575 --> 00:14:05,857
I defined the scrapper layer as a discrete space

276
00:14:05,857 --> 00:14:06,958
with two doors, like so.

277
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:10,201
When the player collects the parts necessary in the area,

278
00:14:10,201 --> 00:14:12,182
I simply invalidate the door they came in through

279
00:14:12,182 --> 00:14:13,523
and I open the other door.

280
00:14:13,523 --> 00:14:15,064
Then the breadcrumbing system takes them out.

281
00:14:15,064 --> 00:14:16,025
Simple.

282
00:14:16,025 --> 00:14:20,869
As an experiment in open world quest design,

283
00:14:20,869 --> 00:14:23,771
what did FreeHeat teach us?

284
00:14:24,578 --> 00:14:27,199
Multiplayer online RPGs, though open world,

285
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,919
require you to structure your quests in a way

286
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:33,121
that single player open world RPGs just don't.

287
00:14:33,121 --> 00:14:35,361
Story informs our quest structure a lot.

288
00:14:35,361 --> 00:14:37,062
Openness will often take a backseat

289
00:14:37,062 --> 00:14:39,423
to a great story in Horizon.

290
00:14:39,423 --> 00:14:41,443
Lastly, invest in player guidance systems.

291
00:14:41,443 --> 00:14:44,384
This is extremely important and will save you a lot of heartache

292
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:44,925
in open world games.

293
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:50,547
As a contrast, I'm going to talk about the Grave Horde.

294
00:14:51,092 --> 00:14:53,553
Grave Horde is a linear bunker quest taking place

295
00:14:53,553 --> 00:14:56,934
around the middle of the main story of Horizon.

296
00:14:56,934 --> 00:14:59,755
As I mentioned before, there are a lot of main story quests

297
00:14:59,755 --> 00:15:02,456
that take place in bunkers.

298
00:15:02,456 --> 00:15:04,277
Here's an illustration of what I'm talking about.

299
00:15:04,277 --> 00:15:07,818
If you add cauldrons to that, you begin to get a sense

300
00:15:07,818 --> 00:15:09,619
of how much linear interior space

301
00:15:09,619 --> 00:15:10,960
there really is in Horizon.

302
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:15,141
This is the earliest wireframe gray box

303
00:15:15,141 --> 00:15:17,222
of the Grave Horde done in Maya.

304
00:15:17,222 --> 00:15:19,323
If Freeheap's flow is like a loop,

305
00:15:19,323 --> 00:15:20,803
this sucker is a straight line.

306
00:15:23,192 --> 00:15:28,213
Compare the gray box wireframe above against the shipped version below.

307
00:15:28,213 --> 00:15:33,595
I've added these colored areas to indicate the spaces that correlate to one another.

308
00:15:33,595 --> 00:15:36,995
As you can see, a lot of the spaces stayed.

309
00:15:36,995 --> 00:15:38,956
They hung out between the first design and the last.

310
00:15:38,956 --> 00:15:42,817
The macro level design of this quest stayed pretty consistent throughout

311
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:46,898
development, because that's what I was familiar with, and I got it pretty much right.

312
00:15:46,898 --> 00:15:49,498
That is not true of the micro level design.

313
00:15:51,258 --> 00:15:54,099
Quickly, let me define what I'm talking about here.

314
00:15:54,099 --> 00:15:54,959
Macro level design.

315
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,180
Each space is a significant moment, aka a beat,

316
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,580
that's what we call it, of the level as a whole.

317
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:03,561
The image on the left is an in-game map

318
00:16:03,561 --> 00:16:05,701
of a starship level from Star Wars The Old Republic.

319
00:16:05,701 --> 00:16:07,801
That's what I mostly worked on when I was there.

320
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:09,982
On the right is an image of an in-game map

321
00:16:09,982 --> 00:16:12,202
from the Grave Horde.

322
00:16:12,202 --> 00:16:14,923
In both cases, rooms serve as story beats

323
00:16:14,923 --> 00:16:17,463
or gameplay beats, with the corridors in between

324
00:16:17,463 --> 00:16:19,563
sized to help the pacing of the overall level.

325
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:29,088
This is the type of level design familiar to RPG designers like me, given my background building dungeons in Elder Scrolls Online and starships in Star Wars The Old Republic.

326
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:32,069
So I thought that this was like directly applicable.

327
00:16:32,069 --> 00:16:41,872
Micro-level design. Each space within the level is itself a story and must be designed with its own beats.

328
00:16:41,872 --> 00:16:46,633
This is the type of level design familiar to action game designers more so than role-playing game designers.

329
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:51,035
This is also the type of level design I was least familiar with given my background.

330
00:16:51,035 --> 00:16:57,818
This is the earliest playable gray box of the armory combat area of the Grave Horde.

331
00:16:57,818 --> 00:17:02,699
The armory is right smack dab in the middle of the level, and it's one of three combat spaces in the bunker.

332
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:08,021
The beat before the armory is a puzzle, and the beat after the armory is kind of a story moment.

333
00:17:08,021 --> 00:17:13,904
So it made sense structurally to do a big combat beat here in the middle.

334
00:17:13,904 --> 00:17:15,064
Here's another angle for you.

335
00:17:16,015 --> 00:17:19,116
The lines indicate the intended player path for clarity's sake.

336
00:17:19,116 --> 00:17:22,237
The red line is kind of what I expected most players to do.

337
00:17:22,237 --> 00:17:24,697
The purple lines were, I don't know,

338
00:17:24,697 --> 00:17:27,558
other things you could do if you were going to be sneaky.

339
00:17:27,558 --> 00:17:29,778
And the yellow box is where I expected the bad guys to go.

340
00:17:29,778 --> 00:17:34,479
So feedback on this early gray box

341
00:17:34,479 --> 00:17:36,260
was a negative, to say the least.

342
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:40,241
And I think you'll know why if you saw David's talk earlier.

343
00:17:40,241 --> 00:17:41,541
This led me to one question.

344
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,081
I got bad readability, overly simple, uninteresting,

345
00:17:47,081 --> 00:17:50,342
like a bad Killzone level.

346
00:17:50,342 --> 00:17:53,183
But what is a good Killzone level?

347
00:17:53,183 --> 00:17:54,043
I had no idea.

348
00:17:54,043 --> 00:17:56,143
Our creative director had 10 years

349
00:17:56,143 --> 00:17:58,204
of experience making Killzone,

350
00:17:58,204 --> 00:18:00,905
whereas the Quest team had comparatively little experience.

351
00:18:00,905 --> 00:18:03,886
In fact, remember the team photo from earlier?

352
00:18:03,886 --> 00:18:07,067
Only one guy on the Quest team had worked on Killzone.

353
00:18:07,067 --> 00:18:09,888
The rest of us arrived to Guerrilla

354
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:11,848
with Horizon as our first project at the company.

355
00:18:13,822 --> 00:18:17,562
I went to my boss at the time, distraught, and I said to him,

356
00:18:17,562 --> 00:18:19,723
I don't know if I'm the best guy in the building to do this.

357
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:23,644
My knowledge of action game level design is limited,

358
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,884
and there are a bunch of people at Guerrilla way better at it

359
00:18:25,884 --> 00:18:26,404
than I am.

360
00:18:26,404 --> 00:18:29,285
His response to me was, you're right.

361
00:18:29,285 --> 00:18:31,185
Let's get you some help.

362
00:18:31,185 --> 00:18:34,206
Let's make use of some of that institutional knowledge.

363
00:18:34,206 --> 00:18:37,586
This led to me being sent the Killzone guide

364
00:18:37,586 --> 00:18:38,967
for good level design, TM.

365
00:18:40,373 --> 00:18:46,395
I want to share some wisdom from a small part of the document with you and show you how I applied it.

366
00:18:46,395 --> 00:18:48,656
So, readability.

367
00:18:48,656 --> 00:18:49,716
Very important page for me.

368
00:18:49,716 --> 00:18:55,958
Entrances, exits, alternative paths, flanking options need to be clear to the player.

369
00:18:55,958 --> 00:19:00,219
The player also needs to recognize where the enemies are, it needs to be clear what can be used as cover,

370
00:19:00,219 --> 00:19:04,060
and this needs to be done in conjunction with viz, environment art, and lighting.

371
00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:08,452
This slide helped me realize something very important

372
00:19:08,452 --> 00:19:12,155
about this room and about the way I was thinking about this.

373
00:19:12,155 --> 00:19:14,517
I was thinking too much about the content of the room

374
00:19:14,517 --> 00:19:16,318
from a top-down perspective, and I

375
00:19:16,318 --> 00:19:19,421
wasn't thinking enough about the way the player saw the room.

376
00:19:19,421 --> 00:19:23,285
This is a view from the entrance to that gray box room.

377
00:19:23,285 --> 00:19:27,729
This is the exit and the goal.

378
00:19:27,729 --> 00:19:30,531
Because this is a small crawl space and because genius,

379
00:19:30,531 --> 00:19:32,413
I put a whole bunch of boxes in front of it.

380
00:19:32,413 --> 00:19:33,213
It's not very clear.

381
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,397
Speaking of the boxes, this is where all the bad guys are supposed to be,

382
00:19:37,397 --> 00:19:40,898
but because there's so many boxes, you have no idea where they could be standing.

383
00:19:40,898 --> 00:19:47,081
These tanks are supposed to be your cover, but you can't tell because they are

384
00:19:47,081 --> 00:19:50,403
regularly shaped, and they're much too close to the entrance to be perceived in

385
00:19:50,403 --> 00:19:51,043
their entirety.

386
00:19:51,043 --> 00:19:55,545
Anyway, you get my point. Red, red, red, bad, bad, bad.

387
00:19:55,545 --> 00:19:56,786
My readability really sucked.

388
00:19:56,786 --> 00:20:03,069
This slide was also gold for me, but not in the way you might first expect.

389
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:03,149
So...

390
00:20:04,023 --> 00:20:05,504
Encounters must be multi-staged.

391
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:08,385
Roots leave player efficiently through the environment.

392
00:20:08,385 --> 00:20:09,586
Provide opportunities for flanking.

393
00:20:09,586 --> 00:20:12,527
Keep multiple paths within the same area.

394
00:20:12,527 --> 00:20:17,050
Create variety in heights.

395
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,751
I thought to myself, I think my level has these things.

396
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:20,772
But then it occurred to me, this.

397
00:20:20,772 --> 00:20:23,733
This made sense to me.

398
00:20:23,733 --> 00:20:24,394
I could do this.

399
00:20:24,394 --> 00:20:29,657
So what I decided to do was I tried to take elements

400
00:20:29,657 --> 00:20:33,078
from this and put it into my level to see if they worked.

401
00:20:33,884 --> 00:20:37,405
If this was a good kills on level, I think I could do this.

402
00:20:37,405 --> 00:20:40,546
Are you guys familiar with the term aping?

403
00:20:40,546 --> 00:20:45,427
We say aping when we mean that we copy something, right?

404
00:20:45,427 --> 00:20:48,267
That we emulate what we see other people do.

405
00:20:48,267 --> 00:20:51,608
The funny thing is apes actually don't learn this way.

406
00:20:51,608 --> 00:20:53,088
Humans learn this way.

407
00:20:53,088 --> 00:20:55,969
And adding elements of this to my level design

408
00:20:55,969 --> 00:20:57,209
taught me a whole bunch of things.

409
00:20:57,209 --> 00:21:01,870
So I reworked my gray box to match the example as closely

410
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:02,370
as I could.

411
00:21:03,145 --> 00:21:07,387
I kept the armory feeling with the tanks and the ammunition boxes, as well as adding small

412
00:21:07,387 --> 00:21:08,708
sub-interior rooms as offices.

413
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:13,170
Basically, I learned a lot by trying to copy the example as close as I could by aping it.

414
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:18,452
The new design offered multiple routes that led the player efficiently through the space,

415
00:21:18,452 --> 00:21:21,914
the routes offered flanking opportunities, and a variety of heights.

416
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:27,736
This is the new view from the entrance to the room, much more readable and much more

417
00:21:27,736 --> 00:21:29,037
optimized.

418
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:32,478
As we moved from proper arted building blocks into proper arted.

419
00:21:32,718 --> 00:21:36,521
building blocks, we ditched the straight ramp that was into the room and replaced it with

420
00:21:36,521 --> 00:21:40,824
this switchback staircase for a very important reason.

421
00:21:40,824 --> 00:21:44,407
Jumping down right as you enter the room is an option, but this banister is kind of a

422
00:21:44,407 --> 00:21:45,868
mild barrier right in your way.

423
00:21:45,868 --> 00:21:50,072
It helps to encourage you to have a look around the space before you just go straight in,

424
00:21:50,072 --> 00:21:50,792
guns blazing.

425
00:21:50,792 --> 00:21:55,116
And that's what I really wanted you to do, look around.

426
00:21:55,116 --> 00:21:56,417
Here's what that looks like to the player.

427
00:21:56,417 --> 00:22:00,440
Now I'm going to show you what this looks like in the finished game.

428
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:11,531
So as we round the corner and we actually get our first look

429
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:15,973
into the room, you'll notice that the goal is clearly lit.

430
00:22:15,973 --> 00:22:22,256
That's where you need to go.

431
00:22:22,256 --> 00:22:26,658
As you proceed in, the total area reveals itself to you.

432
00:22:26,658 --> 00:22:28,238
And the bad guys reveal themselves to you.

433
00:22:28,238 --> 00:22:30,819
And your options slowly reveal themselves to you.

434
00:22:30,819 --> 00:22:32,700
If you look around the room, the enemy placement

435
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,521
will help to inform you what your options are in the space.

436
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:38,122
Also, a very important tip I got from one of the other designers

437
00:22:38,497 --> 00:22:40,918
Use your pickup placement to actually show people where they can go.

438
00:22:40,918 --> 00:22:46,401
Lighting is really important, but pickups are actually a great way to tell players where they can and can't go.

439
00:22:46,401 --> 00:22:50,224
Here are some still images of the finished product.

440
00:22:50,224 --> 00:22:55,047
Kudos to the environment artists and the lighting team that worked on this.

441
00:22:55,047 --> 00:22:57,368
It's an incredible result, as you can clearly see.

442
00:22:57,368 --> 00:23:00,810
The goal of this space is clearly lit and highlighted.

443
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:04,612
Enemies aren't hidden. Their placement and pathing makes player options clear.

444
00:23:04,612 --> 00:23:07,454
This space is multi-layered.

445
00:23:07,758 --> 00:23:12,541
It has multiple paths and contains sub-interiors with collectibles and goodies to find.

446
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:18,286
I don't know if it's a great level, but I do know it's not like a bad Killzone level anymore.

447
00:23:18,286 --> 00:23:20,427
So, putting it all together.

448
00:23:20,427 --> 00:23:28,013
What lessons can we abstract from these two level examples from Horizon about finding the balance between RPG and action?

449
00:23:28,013 --> 00:23:30,815
First, these two concepts are not opposing forces.

450
00:23:30,815 --> 00:23:36,780
I'd encourage you to consider them as lenses.

451
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:40,791
in the way that Jesse Schell uses that term in his book,

452
00:23:40,791 --> 00:23:42,831
The Art of Game Design.

453
00:23:42,831 --> 00:23:51,853
Each represents a viewpoint from which you can consider your design priorities.

454
00:23:51,853 --> 00:23:56,694
So, concept one, macro versus micro.

455
00:23:56,694 --> 00:24:00,235
As I've demonstrated, open world RPGs focus more on macro design,

456
00:24:00,235 --> 00:24:02,555
whereas action games focus more on micro design.

457
00:24:03,378 --> 00:24:05,939
When you think about a quest's macro design,

458
00:24:05,939 --> 00:24:09,340
think about structuring your quest in service of the story.

459
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,841
When you think about a space's micro design,

460
00:24:11,841 --> 00:24:13,241
ask yourself if the area is designed

461
00:24:13,241 --> 00:24:15,082
to demonstrate the challenges

462
00:24:15,082 --> 00:24:19,504
and the options at the player's disposal.

463
00:24:19,504 --> 00:24:24,906
Concept two, approach.

464
00:24:24,906 --> 00:24:27,627
Freeheap shows you should try to design your quest space

465
00:24:27,627 --> 00:24:29,507
to funnel the player to the quest bestower,

466
00:24:29,507 --> 00:24:31,148
and thus the beginning of the quest.

467
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:35,620
It is equally important, as I demonstrated with Gravehorts Armory,

468
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:39,662
that you need to think about how players approach individual spaces,

469
00:24:39,662 --> 00:24:41,983
not just entire areas.

470
00:24:41,983 --> 00:24:48,045
A player's first view of a room has to tell them a lot about it.

471
00:24:48,045 --> 00:24:54,647
Concept 3. Movement.

472
00:24:54,647 --> 00:24:58,849
RPGs are principally interested in players' movement from space to pace,

473
00:24:58,849 --> 00:24:59,869
and from beat to beat.

474
00:25:00,644 --> 00:25:05,347
I explained a bit about breadcrumbing to demonstrate how manipulating the player's guidance system

475
00:25:05,347 --> 00:25:08,609
can ensure optimal flow through a quest space.

476
00:25:08,609 --> 00:25:12,851
The Jungle Gym concept in FreeHeap was an attempt to capture how movement itself can

477
00:25:12,851 --> 00:25:16,693
be engaging and can provide a feeling of openness.

478
00:25:16,693 --> 00:25:22,196
There are many things you can do as a player to make spaces themselves more engaging, more

479
00:25:22,196 --> 00:25:23,717
fun and more joyful.

480
00:25:23,717 --> 00:25:26,278
Case in point, the big ride from the end of the grave hoard.

481
00:25:28,733 --> 00:25:32,875
So we knew throughout development that we were going to have this quest in a high place

482
00:25:32,875 --> 00:25:36,296
and we needed Aloy to get off of a mountain.

483
00:25:36,296 --> 00:25:38,317
So I added this gigantic zip line.

484
00:25:38,317 --> 00:25:45,740
I put this in and I expected it to get cut every single time it went through review because

485
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,100
it's crazy.

486
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,680
But people got it.

487
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,602
When they played it, they were like, wow, this is kind of fun.

488
00:25:50,602 --> 00:25:52,082
It's kind of joyful and I kind of get it.

489
00:25:52,082 --> 00:25:55,863
I'm amazed that it's in the finished product and I'm so happy that it is.

490
00:25:59,737 --> 00:26:01,918
Concepts four, final point.

491
00:26:01,918 --> 00:26:10,321
Though we may fancy what we create as art,

492
00:26:10,321 --> 00:26:12,021
it is also entertainment.

493
00:26:12,021 --> 00:26:15,402
To make a film reference, sometimes we're Wes Anderson

494
00:26:15,402 --> 00:26:17,203
and sometimes we're Michael Bay.

495
00:26:17,203 --> 00:26:22,245
Strive always for engagement as well as emotion,

496
00:26:22,245 --> 00:26:23,945
for feeling as well as fun,

497
00:26:23,945 --> 00:26:28,207
and meaning as well as explosions.

498
00:26:29,862 --> 00:26:42,326
Thank you.

499
00:26:42,326 --> 00:26:46,947
I'd like to thank Guerrilla Games and our publisher, Sony, for supporting me giving

500
00:26:46,947 --> 00:26:47,567
this talk.

501
00:26:47,567 --> 00:26:50,748
I wouldn't be here today without the faith, patience, and gratitude that they show me.

502
00:26:50,748 --> 00:26:55,409
I'd also like to thank my team and the rest of the designers at Guerrilla, from whom I

503
00:26:55,409 --> 00:26:56,250
learned so much.

504
00:26:59,525 --> 00:27:01,127
And now I've got some time for questions.

505
00:27:01,127 --> 00:27:08,172
Microphones, bring them on.

506
00:27:08,172 --> 00:27:18,561
Also, if you'd rather, you're welcome to come

507
00:27:18,561 --> 00:27:20,342
and find me after the talk,

508
00:27:20,342 --> 00:27:23,605
or email me or at me on Twitter, at BigRebo,

509
00:27:23,605 --> 00:27:25,906
whatever makes you comfortable.

510
00:27:25,906 --> 00:27:26,007
Hello.

511
00:27:26,435 --> 00:27:31,036
Hi there. So you have a lot of experience working on MMOs and quest design there.

512
00:27:31,036 --> 00:27:37,298
Did you face any resistance from the team at Guerrilla when you came in and were talking about like,

513
00:27:37,298 --> 00:27:40,880
let's take some of these MMO learnings and put them into a single player game?

514
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:46,862
What did that process look like? Did it feel organic to kind of take that and transition into single player stuff?

515
00:27:46,862 --> 00:27:49,642
Well, like I pointed out, the quest team was really new.

516
00:27:49,642 --> 00:27:56,345
And I was really lucky that I came on board along with a guy named David Ford, who was the quest lead on Horizon.

517
00:27:57,256 --> 00:28:01,780
And I had worked with him on Elder Scrolls Online. I followed him to Amsterdam.

518
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:06,984
So, things that we wanted to try, like I said, the experiment with FreeHeap was really,

519
00:28:06,984 --> 00:28:13,709
hey David, can we do a quest objective like we did on Elder Scrolls and Horizon? Let's see if it works.

520
00:28:13,709 --> 00:28:16,572
And he was always open for that kind of experimentation.

521
00:28:16,572 --> 00:28:20,375
Granted, not everything we tried worked out. We had to break a few eggs.

522
00:28:21,024 --> 00:28:27,651
But Guerrilla was really supportive and they knew that they needed the kinds of experience that we brought to the table.

523
00:28:27,651 --> 00:28:36,360
They knew when they were making Horizon that they needed people from experience and from types of games that they didn't have a lot of experience with.

524
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,102
Well I think it worked.

525
00:28:38,102 --> 00:28:39,002
Thank you.

526
00:28:39,002 --> 00:28:39,063
Hi.

527
00:28:39,063 --> 00:28:39,503
Hello.

528
00:28:43,124 --> 00:28:48,067
Do you have any advice as far as making an action adventure map and communicating with

529
00:28:48,067 --> 00:28:53,330
your art team to make sure that the design is still communicated when they go through

530
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:56,312
with 3D modeling and making the whole map?

531
00:28:56,312 --> 00:29:02,735
You know, I could probably give a whole other talk on that, but with Horizon, we knew in

532
00:29:02,735 --> 00:29:06,698
the open world that we wanted to emulate the natural world, the real world.

533
00:29:06,698 --> 00:29:10,980
So when I was building something like FreeHeap, I actually knew kind of the part of the United

534
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,201
States where it was supposed to go.

535
00:29:12,925 --> 00:29:17,747
And we looked to real locations in the real world for inspiration.

536
00:29:17,747 --> 00:29:22,488
When you're building an underground space, a bunker, you don't have those natural touch

537
00:29:22,488 --> 00:29:22,868
points.

538
00:29:22,868 --> 00:29:24,689
You don't have a natural frame of reference.

539
00:29:24,689 --> 00:29:26,029
It's a lot like a kill zone level.

540
00:29:26,029 --> 00:29:32,251
Another thing is when you're working with really big areas, if something changes between

541
00:29:32,251 --> 00:29:37,653
your gray box and the kind of arted product, you naturally get small changes.

542
00:29:37,653 --> 00:29:40,393
But with big areas, those small changes don't matter as much.

543
00:29:40,393 --> 00:29:42,734
They don't cause a lot of turbulence.

544
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:48,277
Whereas if you're dealing with very small spaces, small changes can change the feel a lot.

545
00:29:48,277 --> 00:29:53,763
So you have to work very, very closely with artists, especially if you're working in tight areas and small areas.

546
00:29:53,763 --> 00:29:58,448
They need to know how changing a boulder from, you know, moving a boulder five meters,

547
00:29:58,448 --> 00:30:00,110
they need to know how important that is.

548
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:03,414
Thank you. Sure.

549
00:30:03,414 --> 00:30:03,634
Yes.

550
00:30:05,627 --> 00:30:10,691
very macro level as far as players can do quests in any order, especially the side quests.

551
00:30:10,691 --> 00:30:14,955
Do you have any lessons learned for making sure things ramp up properly or whatever over

552
00:30:14,955 --> 00:30:16,016
the course of the game?

553
00:30:16,016 --> 00:30:20,299
Well, this is a slide I wanted to add, but it's interesting.

554
00:30:20,299 --> 00:30:23,562
I think if you think about most open world games, like I think that Skyrim is a great

555
00:30:23,562 --> 00:30:32,810
example, the game is shaped a lot like sort of like you, the world, and Horizon is actually

556
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:34,011
shaped like a funnel.

557
00:30:34,372 --> 00:30:37,112
that gets bigger and bigger.

558
00:30:37,112 --> 00:30:40,013
So the first couple quests of the game,

559
00:30:40,013 --> 00:30:41,414
you're on a linear path,

560
00:30:41,414 --> 00:30:42,914
and then the world starts to open to you.

561
00:30:42,914 --> 00:30:44,815
And you need to be keenly aware

562
00:30:44,815 --> 00:30:46,515
when you're making an open-world game

563
00:30:46,515 --> 00:30:48,156
of when that world opens.

564
00:30:48,156 --> 00:30:51,777
If you know when those points of broadening are,

565
00:30:51,777 --> 00:30:53,117
you can get a much better sense

566
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:55,038
of how you can design your inner connectivity.

567
00:30:55,038 --> 00:30:56,058
Does that help?

568
00:30:56,058 --> 00:30:56,818
Yeah, sure.

569
00:30:56,818 --> 00:30:58,779
I just was curious if there was any lessons

570
00:30:58,779 --> 00:31:01,640
that you guys learned, and that sounds interesting, yeah.

571
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:01,720
Yeah.

572
00:31:04,882 --> 00:31:09,145
Kind of going off of the environment art question,

573
00:31:09,145 --> 00:31:12,727
what was your experience with like when working with art,

574
00:31:12,727 --> 00:31:14,729
like on FreeHeap, being like,

575
00:31:14,729 --> 00:31:17,151
okay, we need to add some extra affordances.

576
00:31:17,151 --> 00:31:19,893
We need to potentially limit player movement.

577
00:31:19,893 --> 00:31:22,415
We need to like put this massive wall.

578
00:31:22,415 --> 00:31:23,756
Like, can you describe that process

579
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:27,619
and kind of like how you guys solved some of those problems,

580
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:30,261
whether it's like quick concept or stuff like that?

581
00:31:30,261 --> 00:31:31,282
It's all about goals.

582
00:31:31,813 --> 00:31:36,594
If you make it clear to everyone what your goals are and what you're trying to accomplish,

583
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:40,835
I often say that design is like sort of being the advocate in chief.

584
00:31:40,835 --> 00:31:43,936
You have to be the chief advocate of a piece of content.

585
00:31:43,936 --> 00:31:47,077
You have to make sure that people understand not only what it is,

586
00:31:47,077 --> 00:31:50,258
but why you're doing the things that you're doing.

587
00:31:50,258 --> 00:31:53,879
We know that we needed to get the player to the quest bestower.

588
00:31:53,879 --> 00:31:59,640
Something that we did on Elder Scrolls is we actually had the ability to have a quest be bestowed anywhere.

589
00:32:01,324 --> 00:32:03,885
On Horizon, we never developed that technology.

590
00:32:03,885 --> 00:32:07,807
It's something that we made a deliberate decision about,

591
00:32:07,807 --> 00:32:10,228
that we wanted our conversations to be

592
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:11,728
staged in very specific places so they

593
00:32:11,728 --> 00:32:12,389
could be really high quality.

594
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:16,070
When we made that decision, it was easy to go to the artist

595
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:18,351
and say, hey, look, we made this decision for these reasons,

596
00:32:18,351 --> 00:32:21,192
and this is why we need giant walls.

597
00:32:21,192 --> 00:32:23,793
That wasn't always a popular decision by no means.

598
00:32:23,793 --> 00:32:26,574
But when you can understand it and explain it,

599
00:32:26,574 --> 00:32:27,635
it's the natural decision.

600
00:32:31,193 --> 00:32:38,339
I think we have time for maybe one more?

601
00:32:38,339 --> 00:32:39,440
Negative.

602
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,964
If you'd like to, you can come and ask me any more questions you might have.

603
00:32:42,964 --> 00:32:48,188
Thank you so much for coming to the talk.
