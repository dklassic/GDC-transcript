00:00:01,517 --> 00:00:03,839
Hi everyone, welcome to the GDC Twitch channel.

2
00:00:03,859 --> 00:00:08,382
My name is Brian Francis, the invisible voice inside your head, the person hosting your

3
00:00:08,442 --> 00:00:10,944
game development adventure today.

4
00:00:11,925 --> 00:00:16,629
We are here today checking out a game called MechWarrior 5 Mercenaries, which if you're

5
00:00:16,669 --> 00:00:17,029
like me...

6
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:23,454
This series should be very familiar to you because it was a big staple of 1990s PC gaming.

7
00:00:23,915 --> 00:00:29,219
In the last couple of years, we've also had the new Battletech game, which came from Harebrained Schemes.

8
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:32,421
But today, we're getting back in the world of mech piloting.

9
00:00:32,481 --> 00:00:36,344
We are, as you can see right now, suiting up to get into a nice big stompy mech.

10
00:00:37,645 --> 00:00:40,487
And this game comes to us from the fine folks at Piranha Games.

11
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:45,591
In the lower left-hand corner of the screen, Piranha Games CEO, Russ Bullock.

12
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:48,872
Russ, how are you doing?

13
00:00:48,912 --> 00:00:51,353
Great, thanks for your interest.

14
00:00:51,433 --> 00:00:55,314
I'm glad that it sounds like you like the game.

15
00:00:55,434 --> 00:00:59,835
I think that's all any developer wants to hear.

16
00:00:59,855 --> 00:01:02,575
Well, okay, they want to hear that the game is successful.

17
00:01:02,655 --> 00:01:08,937
But one of the more rewarding things is seeing that the fans got what they wanted out of it.

18
00:01:10,078 --> 00:01:13,260
I'm going over to the chat real quick and give a quick shout out to some of our viewers

19
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,401
like Unnatural Flavors who have shown up already.

20
00:01:16,262 --> 00:01:20,044
For folks in chat, if you're not familiar with our stream what we do is we'll be talking

21
00:01:20,064 --> 00:01:23,726
to Russ about the making of MechWarrior 5 Mercenaries and we're going to be taking your

22
00:01:23,766 --> 00:01:29,830
questions so if you have questions about MechWarrior 5, if you want to know about mech design,

23
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,792
if you want to think about, have questions about balancing heat levels.

24
00:01:35,674 --> 00:01:40,556
Ask him in chat. People like Veritas the Snazzy Dragon. Feel free to just ask questions.

25
00:01:40,596 --> 00:01:46,779
We will pass them on to Russ, the ones that are on topic, and from there we will just hopefully

26
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:52,942
learn more about how this game got made. Russ, like I said, implied before, MechWarrior was

27
00:01:53,102 --> 00:01:58,225
once a dominant PC shooter game. It's kind of a simulation game, shooter game.

28
00:01:59,545 --> 00:02:03,587
Not just because it was a bunch of levels where you popped in a mech and shot things,

29
00:02:03,948 --> 00:02:06,589
but also because you chose an array of mechs,

30
00:02:06,669 --> 00:02:10,551
you managed your mechs in your hangar across a variety of missions.

31
00:02:11,152 --> 00:02:15,474
And then around 2000, MechWarrior 4 was the last proper named MechWarrior game,

32
00:02:15,514 --> 00:02:20,016
and the series kind of spiraled out for different reasons and just wasn't amazed anymore.

33
00:02:20,997 --> 00:02:23,659
Your studio has been working with MechWarrior Online for a bit.

34
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,982
How did your studio get started working in the MechWarrior franchise?

35
00:02:27,683 --> 00:02:30,145
And what are your origins for MechWarrior 5?

36
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:32,407
That's a lot of questions. I'm sorry about that.

37
00:02:32,467 --> 00:02:32,987
It's okay.

38
00:02:34,288 --> 00:02:39,232
No, I would say, well first off, I was a fan of...

39
00:02:39,813 --> 00:02:43,035
I played all those original PC games, even starting in 89.

40
00:02:44,216 --> 00:02:49,140
The original MechWarrior, which honestly might be one of the biggest inspirations for MechWarrior 5 Mercenaries...

41
00:02:49,756 --> 00:02:53,859
So I remember playing that one, you know, begging my mom to buy it in the mall, and

42
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:59,544
then we had to swap out the CGA monitor for an EGA monitor so I could do those simple

43
00:02:59,584 --> 00:03:00,505
new early graphics.

44
00:03:01,065 --> 00:03:06,210
And I played all of them, and I guess even the last one, MechWarrior 4, anyhow, would

45
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:08,852
have been around even since we became a dev studio.

46
00:03:08,892 --> 00:03:16,318
So we started our studio in 2000, and 2000 to 2002 was where MechWarrior 4 and up to

47
00:03:16,358 --> 00:03:17,679
MechWarrior 4 Remerks was launched.

48
00:03:18,568 --> 00:03:21,410
So this was a brand I always had huge interest in.

49
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,251
It was really a dream of mine to work with it,

50
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:26,874
and I always felt like it was almost certainly well out of reach.

51
00:03:26,994 --> 00:03:30,396
But we, really long story short,

52
00:03:30,696 --> 00:03:33,598
we started to form a relationship with Jordan Wiseman,

53
00:03:33,638 --> 00:03:36,961
who had the original FOSA founder and creator,

54
00:03:37,721 --> 00:03:39,362
who had sold FOSA to Microsoft,

55
00:03:39,422 --> 00:03:41,764
but then he had spent some years there

56
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:43,905
and started a new studio and had licensed Arise back.

57
00:03:44,726 --> 00:03:47,488
And in 2008 we started that relationship and

58
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:53,780
2009 we released this video, some people might remember it, it was our attempt to kind of

59
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,900
push for a new MechWarrior game.

60
00:03:55,100 --> 00:04:00,641
And that never got off the ground, but by 2011 we had managed to license those rights

61
00:04:00,982 --> 00:04:03,082
and started work on MechWarrior Online.

62
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:08,643
So MechWarrior Online was something we were extremely interested in, but it was also kind

63
00:04:08,783 --> 00:04:13,504
of a step we felt like we had to take because either we weren't ready, or the market wasn't

64
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:14,084
ready, or...

65
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:19,034
A number of things just weren't ready for the next single player MechWarrior game yet.

66
00:04:19,614 --> 00:04:24,415
So we kind of established both ourselves and our knowledge of MechWarrior but also kind

67
00:04:24,435 --> 00:04:28,556
of re-established a foothold for the brand with MechWarrior Online.

68
00:04:28,996 --> 00:04:33,497
We ran that for a number of years and then it was clear though the minute we started

69
00:04:33,517 --> 00:04:39,239
MechWarrior Online that the fans were super excited and also in the next breath they were

70
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,039
like okay great but where is MechWarrior 5?

71
00:04:42,197 --> 00:04:47,022
So we knew all those years that this is something we really wanted to get to when the timing was right.

72
00:04:47,042 --> 00:04:51,346
Then it was early 2016, we started development.

73
00:04:51,366 --> 00:04:58,092
So a full three years since we started some basic prototyping and production and ramping up to where we finally shipped it.

74
00:04:58,552 --> 00:05:01,255
So it's really a long path, dream come true.

75
00:05:01,722 --> 00:05:11,389
I'm super happy. It's great to hear about devs who get to sort of be inspired by games when they were younger and then get to follow in their footsteps as they build their careers.

76
00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:17,693
I am going to go to the chat real quick. We are going to ask, we're going to pull Hammerzeit's question here.

77
00:05:20,735 --> 00:05:24,717
How did it feel to make an entry to what is considered to be a premier PC series from

78
00:05:24,737 --> 00:05:29,380
the 90s and early 2000s, and how do you adapt this genre to today's markets, especially

79
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,160
as a smaller studio?

80
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,141
I stand corrected.

81
00:05:31,201 --> 00:05:32,581
That's a great question, Hammerzeit.

82
00:05:33,822 --> 00:05:39,945
It is a good question, and it definitely identifies some of the challenges that we face, because

83
00:05:40,486 --> 00:05:45,508
you know, it's not the same world and the same market and everything that it was in

84
00:05:45,548 --> 00:05:47,309
the 90s when MechWarrior was at its heyday.

85
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:47,670
And so...

86
00:05:48,702 --> 00:05:51,864
You have a lot of tough decisions to make early on in production.

87
00:05:51,924 --> 00:05:57,308
It's like, do you want to attempt something radically different

88
00:05:57,788 --> 00:06:01,191
that you think today's gamers want, will adapt to all of today's gamers,

89
00:06:02,191 --> 00:06:05,354
and, you know, try to establish it in that regard?

90
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:12,359
Or do you want to give long-time fans of the franchise what they want?

91
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,702
And we chose the latter, and I think that's for some good reasons.

92
00:06:17,722 --> 00:06:25,526
And it doesn't mean, of course, that MechWarrior 5 Mercenaries doesn't have a significant amount of modern updates when it comes to things.

93
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:35,110
And not just visually and graphically, but in the destructible environments, even in the controls and a lot of things that modern games do today.

94
00:06:35,811 --> 00:06:43,215
But ultimately, what we decided to do was, let's update and give MechWarrior 5 Mercenaries fans...

95
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,121
The game they always dreamed of. The one that they...

96
00:06:46,301 --> 00:06:49,323
When they were playing MechWarrior 4 Mercenaries or MechWarrior 2 Mercenaries,

97
00:06:49,463 --> 00:06:50,403
and they loved it to death,

98
00:06:51,324 --> 00:06:54,065
but when the experience was a little too linear and was over too fast,

99
00:06:54,766 --> 00:06:59,568
and they were left wanting just after maybe 8 to 10 hours of a single-player campaign,

100
00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:02,850
we decided, well, let's make something...

101
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,631
In those moments, you're always dreaming, like, well, what if?

102
00:07:05,731 --> 00:07:07,212
What if you could fly anywhere?

103
00:07:07,252 --> 00:07:09,133
What if you could take contracts anywhere?

104
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:14,173
You know, this, you could do this or that and had your own drop ship and can actually see your mechs.

105
00:07:14,213 --> 00:07:23,241
And we tried to essentially bring what I felt like would be all the dreams of all those years playing those games to life in MechWarrior 5 Mercenaries.

106
00:07:23,661 --> 00:07:29,106
And in doing so, we would meet the requirements and dreams of longtime MechWarrior fans,

107
00:07:29,727 --> 00:07:34,531
but also by modernizing it to today's engines, technology, destructible environments, control schemes.

108
00:07:35,645 --> 00:07:40,768
We'd have also a chance to reach out to, you know, maybe a new generation of MechWarrior fans as well.

109
00:07:41,448 --> 00:07:45,990
So that's how we approached it. You could have gone a different way. You could have really radically

110
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:51,892
changed and revolutionized the entire thing and hoped that it would find an audience, but we

111
00:07:52,553 --> 00:07:57,054
we stuck with, well, we started with our core audience, I guess, and

112
00:07:57,895 --> 00:07:59,135
advanced the concept from there.

113
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:06,564
Right on. Hammerzeit also wants to say thank you for making something as great as MechWarrior 5 after 17 years of quote, twilight years.

114
00:08:06,584 --> 00:08:09,986
I don't know if that's a specific reference to Battletech lore, but...

115
00:08:12,427 --> 00:08:14,708
We are going to get to some other questions from folks in chat.

116
00:08:16,049 --> 00:08:19,231
Zayde, Azmay, we do see your questions, but for now we're going to...

117
00:08:19,851 --> 00:08:22,973
I'm going to lean in on some of the development focus questions that we've got lined up here.

118
00:08:23,813 --> 00:08:28,155
Russ, the first one I have to ask is, I think some of the things that defines MechWarrior

119
00:08:28,195 --> 00:08:33,858
for me and my love of giant robots is the sensation that unlike other giant robot experiences

120
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:38,640
in video games, this one is dedicated to make it feel like you're piloting something.

121
00:08:39,581 --> 00:08:43,923
You have the system where you move the torso and the legs in two different directions.

122
00:08:44,343 --> 00:08:50,568
The heat management, you and I were talking before the stream about our days playing this on joystick in the original series.

123
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:58,353
As a new, without sort of any code or assets from the old games to sort of boo you, which that's an assumption I'm making,

124
00:08:59,254 --> 00:09:08,481
how did you start from the ground up making something that would feel like the old systems that was probably more meant to be played on keyboard and mouse since joysticks aren't as popular these days?

125
00:09:09,061 --> 00:09:11,983
And get that piloting sensation even without the piloting peripheral.

126
00:09:12,697 --> 00:09:19,803
Yeah, well, one of the huge advantages we had was that, you know, even when we started

127
00:09:19,843 --> 00:09:25,989
MechWarrior 5 Mercenaries in early 2016, we had already been working on MechWarrior Online

128
00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:26,889
for over five years.

129
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:35,837
So if there's people out there that know MechWarrior Online, there's, you know, we could talk

130
00:09:35,877 --> 00:09:36,618
and debate about...

131
00:09:37,528 --> 00:09:42,650
It is a game that has been around for 8 years in the free to play space.

132
00:09:43,731 --> 00:09:50,233
There is one thing that everyone would agree on, I think, is that the mech combat is great.

133
00:09:50,373 --> 00:09:54,015
It is the high point of the product.

134
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:59,757
We really did establish really great mech combat.

135
00:10:00,178 --> 00:10:01,938
We were bringing that into MechWarrior 5.

136
00:10:02,058 --> 00:10:06,560
We were starting with a strong know-how of how to create strong mech combat.

137
00:10:07,451 --> 00:10:12,814
and starting with all the mech concepts and assets for all the battle mechs that we've spent,

138
00:10:13,274 --> 00:10:17,676
well now, you know, the last eight years concepting and developing, which is also another

139
00:10:18,757 --> 00:10:24,020
like top two strong point of MechWarrior 9 and Piranha Games' work on MechWarrior,

140
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:29,462
is really the establishing and or re-establishing of the look and feel of all the battle mechs in

141
00:10:29,482 --> 00:10:35,005
the universe. Our artist, Alex Iglesias, has concepted out

142
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:39,629
almost all of them at this point. I mean there's still some we haven't got to, but there's so many.

143
00:10:40,329 --> 00:10:44,850
Well over 100 chassis in MechWarrior 9 with, you know, four to five variants each, so we're up into

144
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:52,032
the, you know, over a thousand range. And people have really gravitated towards those, and it's

145
00:10:52,072 --> 00:10:57,453
really become kind of a standard now. We license those art assets out to a harebrained scheme,

146
00:10:57,493 --> 00:11:01,613
so you see the same mechs as MechWarrior 9 and as MechWarrior 5.

147
00:11:02,546 --> 00:11:05,247
In Herobrine's biotech product as well, almost entirely.

148
00:11:05,387 --> 00:11:08,208
They've done a couple, like the Hatchet Man,

149
00:11:08,248 --> 00:11:11,710
and they have the new one in their latest DLC,

150
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:12,750
which is an original concept.

151
00:11:13,351 --> 00:11:15,331
But for the most part, it's been the new mechs

152
00:11:15,351 --> 00:11:18,073
that we've established here at Piranha and in mechWare Online.

153
00:11:18,853 --> 00:11:21,934
So we were bringing these two real strong pillars to the table.

154
00:11:23,175 --> 00:11:26,276
That was a lot of know-how that we had developed over the years

155
00:11:26,636 --> 00:11:28,317
and had at our disposal.

156
00:11:28,957 --> 00:11:29,978
And then, you know, we...

157
00:11:30,718 --> 00:11:35,742
The rest... I think if you play MechWarrior 5, I think it also would be fair to say that

158
00:11:37,604 --> 00:11:44,049
that remains a high point. Our strength would be the mission-to-mission combat simulator is,

159
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:50,014
maybe unsurprisingly, because of our history with MechWarrior 9, is the high point of MechWarrior 5

160
00:11:50,074 --> 00:11:56,680
as well. But we had to develop other expertises in artificial intelligence systems and in campaign

161
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,262
and storytelling. I think those areas...

162
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:03,625
are good, but they're not as strong as some other areas.

163
00:12:03,705 --> 00:12:07,166
And so, again, our strength are in the combat simulator.

164
00:12:08,007 --> 00:12:10,268
And so I think that might get to most of your question,

165
00:12:10,288 --> 00:12:12,008
or did I miss maybe a piece of that?

166
00:12:12,068 --> 00:12:13,729
Yeah, well, I guess I'll zero in on the question

167
00:12:13,749 --> 00:12:16,610
of what do you think makes piloting feel good

168
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:17,771
in a modern game space?

169
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,311
Like, what do you think your team did right

170
00:12:19,352 --> 00:12:20,812
about the feeling of piloting?

171
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:21,973
Hmm, okay.

172
00:12:22,633 --> 00:12:25,434
Yeah, well, the torso-twisting feeling, that is,

173
00:12:27,356 --> 00:12:34,041
It's good that you're showing the tutorial of the game here because it is the type of game that still requires a tutorial.

174
00:12:34,101 --> 00:12:40,246
Because there's a lot of people that have never played anything quite like this before.

175
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:47,271
And that's what makes MechWarrior so unique is that there is this concept that you're essentially a walking tank.

176
00:12:47,471 --> 00:12:53,376
And that's where MechWarrior 5 is good because it has this really great third-person camera

177
00:12:53,436 --> 00:12:55,838
which quickly explains to players that...

178
00:12:56,544 --> 00:12:56,684
that

179
00:12:56,704 --> 00:12:58,165
lower combat, then say like your average FPP shooter.

180
00:12:58,185 --> 00:13:01,006
I think the amount of things that's going through the person's brain while they're playing

181
00:13:01,026 --> 00:13:03,988
a game like MechWarrior is every bit as high or intense as any

182
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:30,772
Super Twitch FPS. It's just that because you're always making movements on your controls

183
00:13:30,832 --> 00:13:35,173
It's that you're thinking ahead like five steps ahead. It's like well if I want to

184
00:13:36,114 --> 00:13:40,895
Back up and get behind this building and get cover before that guy finishes turning around

185
00:13:41,355 --> 00:13:46,297
Then I've got to start making those movements ahead of time to slow this giant mech down

186
00:13:46,637 --> 00:13:51,078
Put it into reverse and turn and back around that corner before he can finish his turn

187
00:13:51,158 --> 00:13:54,759
so although what's being presented on the screen is

188
00:13:55,452 --> 00:13:59,333
I'm not sure if it's a better way to describe this than a twitch first person shooter.

189
00:14:00,294 --> 00:14:05,456
I think the actions inside the player's head and the movements they're planning is every bit as intense.

190
00:14:05,496 --> 00:14:08,378
So it's very satisfying that way.

191
00:14:09,338 --> 00:14:13,200
You have the lumbering sounds, the turning sounds of your torso,

192
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,542
the reaction as you shoot your weapons or take hits,

193
00:14:17,862 --> 00:14:21,123
the sparks in your cockpit when you take a hit,

194
00:14:22,104 --> 00:14:25,065
as you lose bits and pieces of your mech.

195
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:26,711
in turn losing weapons.

196
00:14:27,352 --> 00:14:32,016
There's just so many things that add up to a mech cockpit experience and

197
00:14:32,697 --> 00:14:36,180
again I think that's something we have had now about eight years to fine-tune

198
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,222
between MWO and MechWarrior 5, so

199
00:14:39,744 --> 00:14:42,767
the magic is in there and it's just a collection I think of

200
00:14:43,527 --> 00:14:44,869
dozens of things that the guys have

201
00:14:45,749 --> 00:14:47,331
learned and developed over the last eight years.

202
00:14:48,031 --> 00:14:51,892
Right on. I'm going to jump to the chat real quick.

203
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:57,413
CyberAlpha05 asked if there was any collaboration with the Harebrained Studios BattleTech team.

204
00:14:57,453 --> 00:15:01,174
I think you mentioned there that you guys have been licensing mech design to them.

205
00:15:02,175 --> 00:15:06,116
Anything else from the fine folks at Harebrained that have helped you out?

206
00:15:07,816 --> 00:15:10,957
Not much. There's not a lot between the studios in that regard.

207
00:15:12,017 --> 00:15:14,118
We know each other well. We're friends of each other.

208
00:15:14,258 --> 00:15:16,018
They come to mechcon and everything.

209
00:15:17,228 --> 00:15:21,470
For BattleTech, we licensed artwork to them and they used that.

210
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:24,571
And it's pretty much the same thing this way.

211
00:15:25,111 --> 00:15:28,392
The jump ship you see in the travel sequences is theirs.

212
00:15:29,713 --> 00:15:31,333
That's the only artwork that I'm aware of.

213
00:15:31,734 --> 00:15:35,255
But also they offered quite a bit of valuable help in the localization front

214
00:15:35,295 --> 00:15:38,996
because they had already gone through localization at BattleTech

215
00:15:39,316 --> 00:15:41,877
and I believe they shipped with the same languages that we did.

216
00:15:41,917 --> 00:15:44,678
We shipped with... besides English we had...

217
00:15:45,646 --> 00:15:51,028
French, German and Russian, which are strong languages for the MechWarrior brand.

218
00:15:51,068 --> 00:15:55,269
And they had gone through the same process, so I know that our guys here in Localization

219
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:59,831
got help from a couple of individuals on their side, helped out a lot in Localization.

220
00:15:59,871 --> 00:16:01,532
So, that's about it.

221
00:16:03,172 --> 00:16:05,313
Each of our studios are just so busy with their own games.

222
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:06,933
There's not a lot of like...

223
00:16:07,414 --> 00:16:10,315
You know, we're not talking about the campaign or the story, which...

224
00:16:10,952 --> 00:16:13,293
with each other about each other's games or anything like that.

225
00:16:13,533 --> 00:16:14,393
But just help out.

226
00:16:14,453 --> 00:16:15,393
Oh, can we help you with Loke?

227
00:16:15,413 --> 00:16:16,094
Can we help you with some...

228
00:16:16,554 --> 00:16:17,674
Sure, you know, you can use our...

229
00:16:18,575 --> 00:16:20,496
We'll use some of yours and stuff like that.

230
00:16:20,516 --> 00:16:23,077
Stuff that would help with, you know, production time,

231
00:16:23,577 --> 00:16:25,217
production risk, things like that.

232
00:16:25,358 --> 00:16:27,759
The Loke thing is actually something I would super want to dive into

233
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:31,680
just because, you know, reaching new markets in any video game space

234
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,381
is kind of an important conversation for devs.

235
00:16:34,281 --> 00:16:39,123
I am going to dive to one more question before I return to my questions.

236
00:16:39,183 --> 00:16:39,483
However...

237
00:16:40,864 --> 00:16:48,165
Veritas the Snazzy Dragon would like to know, would you talk a little about how the mechs ported to MechWarrior Online were overhauled to have new damage models?

238
00:16:48,226 --> 00:16:53,127
For me, this is one of the most important and impressive parts of MechWarrior 5 visually.

239
00:16:53,227 --> 00:16:55,347
Y'all are asking some good questions today, thank you.

240
00:16:57,368 --> 00:17:03,649
Yeah, so we were able to bring over the mechs pretty much as is.

241
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:07,470
We didn't remodel them, which was really key to our design.

242
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:10,592
We're like, okay, we're only so big of a studio.

243
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:14,215
It's not like we can remodel, like, you know, six years worth of models.

244
00:17:14,995 --> 00:17:20,420
So, good thing that they were still really great models that held up really well,

245
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:21,801
and we brought them over.

246
00:17:22,381 --> 00:17:26,785
But we did know that we wanted to go significantly further with the damage state.

247
00:17:27,265 --> 00:17:34,591
In MechWarrior 9, it looks great, but it's limited really to basically just arm removal.

248
00:17:34,651 --> 00:17:35,872
Once the arms are blown off.

249
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:40,398
I think that's the only thing that actually has a model swap, if I'm not mistaken, in

250
00:17:40,438 --> 00:17:42,580
MechWarrior Online, we'll model swap out the arms.

251
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,163
And so, of course, we thought about a lot of different ways we could approach this,

252
00:17:47,203 --> 00:17:52,507
but we also wanted to be careful that we weren't overreaching into something overly complex

253
00:17:52,607 --> 00:17:57,571
where you spend massive amounts of engineering resources just to end up with something that

254
00:17:57,591 --> 00:17:58,391
looks kind of odd.

255
00:17:58,992 --> 00:18:04,015
So we basically just went with kind of what we knew, but went a lot further.

256
00:18:04,095 --> 00:18:05,757
So in MechWarrior Online...

257
00:18:07,204 --> 00:18:09,466
You have the pristine paint.

258
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:13,609
When you get shot with a laser, you have the laser glow.

259
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:16,892
And then whenever you get shot, whether it's laser or anything,

260
00:18:16,932 --> 00:18:18,933
you have the damage texture layer.

261
00:18:18,993 --> 00:18:21,515
So it removes the paint and shows the pock marks and stuff

262
00:18:21,555 --> 00:18:22,476
like you're taking damage.

263
00:18:23,077 --> 00:18:28,141
And then that's kind of all the MWO does until a limb is lost,

264
00:18:28,181 --> 00:18:30,242
like an arm is lost, and then you do the model swaps.

265
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:36,865
In MechWarrior 5, we have the damage, like the laser glow, and we have the damage texture.

266
00:18:37,485 --> 00:18:44,050
But we went a little further, we said, okay, damage texture represents your armor, like you're still in, you still have armor left on your mech.

267
00:18:44,731 --> 00:18:48,153
But when you get to internal structure, we're actually going to do a model swap.

268
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:57,080
And then, once the, once all the internal structure is gone, we'll do another model swap to the destroyed state.

269
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:02,033
And that's the case in almost every component, but obviously with the certain areas like

270
00:19:02,093 --> 00:19:05,594
center torso, when you're done with structure, your mech's dead anyhow, but there's still

271
00:19:05,634 --> 00:19:06,355
another model swap.

272
00:19:06,915 --> 00:19:12,557
So what this turns out to be is you have two arms, two legs, two torsos, a center torso,

273
00:19:12,597 --> 00:19:15,879
a head, and then even the rear torsos.

274
00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:21,161
And you add this up, I think it's something like, what is that, two, four, six, seven.

275
00:19:22,281 --> 00:19:26,543
7 times 3 and I think I'm missing some. You end up having something like between 20 and 30.

276
00:19:26,663 --> 00:19:31,486
I'm a little rusty in this knowledge now. I used to have it all down perfectly, but somewhere between like 20 and 30

277
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:39,771
various damage dates per mech. And so it did, it was a pretty big effort. If you look here, like I guess your footage

278
00:19:40,031 --> 00:19:45,594
it's recorded. You can't, you just walk past the centurion. You can see that on the screen. That's okay. They can see it.

279
00:19:45,954 --> 00:19:49,296
So these legs, I think that right leg there is

280
00:19:49,536 --> 00:19:50,737
destroyed. That's

281
00:19:51,842 --> 00:19:58,264
You know, down to its base model swap out of structure, and then the other leg might be showing some structure left.

282
00:19:58,304 --> 00:20:02,184
And so, it did take quite a bit of effort with every chassis in the game.

283
00:20:02,204 --> 00:20:06,365
We had to model both states.

284
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:11,046
Both armor's gone, and now structure's gone, and we do swaps based on everything.

285
00:20:11,086 --> 00:20:13,987
So that's how the system works, and I think for the most part it works.

286
00:20:14,607 --> 00:20:18,428
I'm really happy with it. It shows tons of detail when you get back to the mech lab.

287
00:20:19,065 --> 00:20:22,968
And that was part of the point too, it's like I want the feedback in real time in combat,

288
00:20:23,028 --> 00:20:27,571
but when you, the whole point of MechWarrior 5 Mercenaries is coming back and being alive

289
00:20:27,611 --> 00:20:30,653
in this hangar, and you want to see that damage persist.

290
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:33,255
So that was a main point as well.

291
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:38,159
And I would say we're like, I'm like 95% happy with it.

292
00:20:38,459 --> 00:20:44,844
The only time it kind of trips up a little bit is in combat, because the model swaps

293
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:47,526
are so precise.

294
00:20:48,797 --> 00:20:54,241
If you're very precise in your shooting and say you're just hitting one particular component,

295
00:20:54,261 --> 00:20:57,023
like just the right dead center in the center torso,

296
00:20:57,804 --> 00:21:02,467
you'll see all the model swaps happen there and it's a very distinct line.

297
00:21:02,968 --> 00:21:07,531
So I think if we were ever to make any improvements, we'd try to do some sort of...

298
00:21:08,605 --> 00:21:15,507
Bleeding out from that pristine line to make it blend a little better, but otherwise, you know really happy with with the overall

299
00:21:15,667 --> 00:21:16,667
system

300
00:21:17,607 --> 00:21:20,688
Brief shout out here to the voice actor behind this particular character spirits

301
00:21:20,748 --> 00:21:25,068
It's the same guy who voices Adam Jensen and deus ex and I'm blanking on his name, but I love his voice

302
00:21:26,029 --> 00:21:28,309
That's a lias to fix it. That's it

303
00:21:28,649 --> 00:21:35,130
Yeah, and he was also in battle tech as the people channel would know he was yeah

304
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:37,091
bad guy red-haired bad guy

305
00:21:38,199 --> 00:21:39,168
in the cinematics where you...

306
00:21:39,862 --> 00:21:41,082
Spoiler alert, he's in that game as well.

307
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:14,911
All of this is super familiar stuff if you've been playing mech warrior for as long as some of the folks in chat have been

308
00:22:15,371 --> 00:22:17,152
You know, this is old hat. How do you think?

309
00:22:18,352 --> 00:22:24,534
You approached you and your team approached redesigning those features for this game and making sure it was still accessible

310
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:28,416
Even the players who didn't know that like hey, it's not a good idea to just kid up your mech with all lasers

311
00:22:28,456 --> 00:22:29,216
Cuz then it overheats

312
00:22:31,417 --> 00:22:37,539
Yeah, it's um, it's you're right. It's one of the key like pillars of any mech warrior game and it's also very

313
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:44,362
It's a big discussion point for a lot of people because there's so many ways to go about a mech lab.

314
00:22:44,883 --> 00:22:51,125
In fact, as many numbered series mech games as there are, there's a different mech lab.

315
00:22:52,226 --> 00:22:55,187
And those that know the intricacies will understand that.

316
00:22:55,787 --> 00:23:01,150
For example, people might remember that MechWarrior 3 was a no-holds-barred, almost Franken-mech system

317
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:03,771
which had maybe a few fans, but some detractors.

318
00:23:04,431 --> 00:23:06,972
MechWarrior 4 went with more of a size hardpoint system.

319
00:23:07,497 --> 00:23:12,481
MechWarrior Online, not part of the numbered series, but MechWarrior Online has, without

320
00:23:12,521 --> 00:23:17,464
a doubt, the most robust mech lab known to mankind.

321
00:23:17,584 --> 00:23:19,926
I mean, it is out there.

322
00:23:20,206 --> 00:23:21,187
It does everything.

323
00:23:21,827 --> 00:23:27,631
And so we had that experience of having a mech lab like MechWarrior Online, which is

324
00:23:27,711 --> 00:23:32,395
great for a PvP game, it allows people to do unbelievable numbers of different builds

325
00:23:32,555 --> 00:23:34,316
looking for the min-max situation.

326
00:23:35,472 --> 00:23:39,854
So we had all that and we could have brought that over exactly to MechWarrior 5, but we didn't.

327
00:23:39,934 --> 00:23:40,774
And for a few reasons.

328
00:23:41,435 --> 00:23:44,176
One is, it is way too much.

329
00:23:44,576 --> 00:23:47,698
If we're trying to re-establish MechWarrior single-player games,

330
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:52,641
PvE, and be successful enough that maybe there's a MechWarrior 6 one day,

331
00:23:54,121 --> 00:24:00,085
we needed it to be understandable and reachable to more than just,

332
00:24:00,885 --> 00:24:03,506
you know, the most hardcore fans of the brand.

333
00:24:04,207 --> 00:24:04,667
So that was...

334
00:24:05,722 --> 00:24:10,246
a fairly big part of it, and of why we brought down the complexity somewhat.

335
00:24:11,046 --> 00:24:14,950
But maybe the bigger element, and this is what I've expressed to the, you know, the

336
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:20,434
MechWarrior 9 community, and it is the bigger element, is MechWarrior 5 is not a PvP multiplayer

337
00:24:20,454 --> 00:24:20,614
game.

338
00:24:20,794 --> 00:24:23,476
It is a single player game that allows co-op play.

339
00:24:24,557 --> 00:24:31,283
And for this reason, you're also managing a mercenary unit, unlike ever before, like

340
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:34,725
to a level of freedom that they've only dreamed about in the past.

341
00:24:35,547 --> 00:24:42,251
In order for that to work, you really need all the various variants of the mechs and

342
00:24:42,291 --> 00:24:45,413
the markets that you visit in the star map to all have some meaning.

343
00:24:46,093 --> 00:24:51,877
With a mechware online style of mech lab, you can almost take any mech and the customization

344
00:24:51,917 --> 00:24:57,780
level is so high that you can accomplish the same thing that other mechs do well, just

345
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,761
through customization.

346
00:24:59,601 --> 00:25:03,644
We felt we needed to limit that quite a bit so that when you...

347
00:25:05,126 --> 00:25:08,907
Customize your mech. It has meaning but you're also not

348
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:14,169
Overriding what other mechs would do so when you go to the market and you see mechs for sale

349
00:25:14,189 --> 00:25:21,091
They're almost any everyone that's there has some meaning like oh neat. I haven't seen that one yet. I'd really like to buy that one

350
00:25:21,111 --> 00:25:26,653
And have this free market system in this metagame really work and make sense

351
00:25:26,713 --> 00:25:33,055
So there's a couple reasons, but still it's a very for a brand new player. There's still you know plenty of depth there

352
00:25:33,075 --> 00:25:33,795
I mean you can still

353
00:25:35,024 --> 00:25:39,246
swap out weapons, three different types of that.

354
00:25:39,726 --> 00:25:42,967
So we have kind of a size hardpoint system as well like MechWarrior 4,

355
00:25:43,007 --> 00:25:46,548
so there are some restrictions, but you can generally put smaller ones in.

356
00:25:47,768 --> 00:25:51,570
But we just don't allow what's called hardpoint inflation,

357
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:55,311
where you can't, say, pull out a large energy weapon

358
00:25:55,331 --> 00:25:56,551
and then put three small ones in.

359
00:25:58,252 --> 00:26:01,653
So anyhow, I think it's an hour long conversation going to Mech Labs,

360
00:26:01,733 --> 00:26:03,053
but it's core.

361
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:05,151
to any MechWarrior experience for sure.

362
00:26:06,011 --> 00:26:11,755
And I feel like anyhow, and I've got some feedback to this, some of the most hardcore

363
00:26:11,775 --> 00:26:16,338
MechWarrior Online fans might still long for the deeper MechLab, but I think for the most

364
00:26:16,398 --> 00:26:22,922
part the feedback has been that we found the right balance for this single player experience,

365
00:26:23,663 --> 00:26:25,023
you know, market driven game.

366
00:26:25,734 --> 00:26:26,535
Right on.

367
00:26:28,597 --> 00:26:30,319
I will get back to some chat questions in a second.

368
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:34,224
I wanted to ask about one more system and how you all approached it.

369
00:26:35,225 --> 00:26:38,408
As you mentioned, this game is not just about piloting the mechs, it's about running the

370
00:26:38,428 --> 00:26:41,692
whole mercenary group, taking systems to systems, contracts.

371
00:26:41,712 --> 00:26:46,657
So it's a really neat metagame that fits in with the story missions, negotiating contracts.

372
00:26:47,538 --> 00:27:03,376
I'm a super big fan of these systems because they help with that simulation aspect and they help you personalize the decisions you're making on not just a mech design level, but like a who is my group, what kind of jobs do we take on, how much trouble are we in right now.

373
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:11,061
I wish we had more time to dive into it on the stream, but we're just going through some

374
00:27:11,081 --> 00:27:11,861
of the early missions here.

375
00:27:12,361 --> 00:27:16,303
But how did your studio approach designing that one, knowing it would kind of be not

376
00:27:16,323 --> 00:27:19,224
just the anchor for your single player mission, you know, not just the backbone for your single

377
00:27:19,244 --> 00:27:24,046
player missions, but also where people will be spending a lot of time if they chose to

378
00:27:24,086 --> 00:27:27,747
ignore the single player, all the main missions and just go run their companies?

379
00:27:30,289 --> 00:27:31,189
Yeah, I think.

380
00:27:33,049 --> 00:27:37,072
fairly early on and one of the messages we kept saying, I know I repeated it in a lot

381
00:27:37,112 --> 00:27:44,137
of meetings, was, you know, where the game is lost, you know, out the gate if we can't

382
00:27:44,277 --> 00:27:51,623
create a metagame experience in the front end that's nearly as fun as being out on the

383
00:27:51,663 --> 00:27:56,967
missions or at least as, you know, addicting and engrossing to want to manage your company.

384
00:27:57,007 --> 00:27:57,368
So that's...

385
00:27:58,206 --> 00:28:02,427
I don't know if we achieved that entirely, meaning I still think going out on the missions

386
00:28:02,727 --> 00:28:03,808
is the funnest aspect.

387
00:28:06,408 --> 00:28:10,390
We did put a lot of effort into that to make sure that we tried to make that metagame experience

388
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:11,790
really meaningful.

389
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:13,851
So you touched on the high points.

390
00:28:14,691 --> 00:28:20,593
First off, there's the ability to travel anywhere you want, but it's fairly expensive to hire

391
00:28:21,513 --> 00:28:25,134
jumpships to take your dropship and your unit places.

392
00:28:25,494 --> 00:28:26,454
Every time you travel...

393
00:28:27,703 --> 00:28:31,545
You know, you're thinking about that, because, you know, there's 100,000 sea bills, 50,000 sea bills, that's a lot.

394
00:28:32,406 --> 00:28:37,368
And the other, I think one of the bigger innovations that we did in our game,

395
00:28:37,428 --> 00:28:42,590
that I don't think has been done before, is this notion that,

396
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:48,152
sure, you can repair your mechs anywhere, but when you're in the war zone,

397
00:28:48,573 --> 00:28:51,274
it's more expensive to do repairs, and it takes more time.

398
00:28:51,914 --> 00:28:56,116
So we created this because we wanted to try to bring the Star Map alive, where...

399
00:28:56,928 --> 00:29:04,550
players were actively always thinking about the star map and where they do certain things.

400
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:12,073
And so we kind of went out of our way to, well for one, if a player wants to hire pilots

401
00:29:12,113 --> 00:29:16,274
for their battle mechs, they're only available in the industrial hubs.

402
00:29:17,054 --> 00:29:23,196
And then to kind of reinforce the industrial hubs, we also said, well, those are penalty

403
00:29:23,256 --> 00:29:24,457
free areas to repair.

404
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:29,212
and you have to repair your mech, so they don't cost extra and it doesn't take extra time.

405
00:29:29,813 --> 00:29:35,395
So now we've created a situation where there's a lot of motivations for the player to plan around

406
00:29:36,516 --> 00:29:40,678
how long they're visiting the war zones versus how long they're visiting the industrial hubs.

407
00:29:41,638 --> 00:29:45,580
And now there's a bit of pressure on you as a mercenary commander to

408
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:52,863
try to have enough functioning mission-worthy battle mechs and pilots that you're not just...

409
00:29:53,608 --> 00:29:56,771
going on one mission repairing everything, going on one mission repairing everything,

410
00:29:56,891 --> 00:29:59,934
but perhaps when you go to the war zone you're thinking,

411
00:30:00,094 --> 00:30:05,099
well, you know, we have enough mechs and pilots to do two missions, maybe even three,

412
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:09,684
if we've got a good stable, before we need to incur those costs to fly out to do all

413
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:10,745
those repairs and whatnot.

414
00:30:10,805 --> 00:30:17,332
So we did quite a few things like that in hopes of bringing, you know, more life to

415
00:30:17,372 --> 00:30:17,932
the Star Map.

416
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:24,103
The View Intel button tells you which planets have which contracts and what mechs you might

417
00:30:24,443 --> 00:30:27,666
encounter in the battlefields and so on.

418
00:30:27,766 --> 00:30:31,909
So that's, I hope that answers the question, but it was definitely a big effort for us.

419
00:30:31,989 --> 00:30:36,013
It wasn't just like, it's all about the missions when you go in here, there's nothing really

420
00:30:36,033 --> 00:30:38,635
to think about except which contract you accept.

421
00:30:38,695 --> 00:30:40,136
It's a little more than that.

422
00:30:40,276 --> 00:30:44,619
You think about the contracts, but you're always thinking about where should I fly next

423
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:46,581
and when should we fly and stuff like that.

424
00:30:46,949 --> 00:30:52,136
I like that answer. I especially like the part where you mentioned using the war zones as an incentive.

425
00:30:52,156 --> 00:30:55,140
Like, hey, you can only be in this area so long, your funds will run out.

426
00:30:57,062 --> 00:30:57,903
That's some good insight.

427
00:30:57,923 --> 00:31:03,551
Yeah, and speaking of that, Aaron Sedrick-Arch says there's an incentive to fail at your mech stable for that reason.

428
00:31:04,853 --> 00:31:07,075
I am going to go back to questions from chat for a minute.

429
00:31:07,835 --> 00:31:12,659
These will be a little off topic for Dev, but you know, you guys have been great.

430
00:31:12,699 --> 00:31:15,141
We'll give you guys some questions that are a little off topic.

431
00:31:17,843 --> 00:31:19,484
Do you have any plans for mod support?

432
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:23,507
And if that's the case, or if it's not the case, can you talk about what it takes to implement

433
00:31:23,667 --> 00:31:25,428
to support modders for games like this?

434
00:31:27,089 --> 00:31:28,070
Yeah, we do.

435
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:32,213
We told the community quite a while ago that we plan to support mods.

436
00:31:33,534 --> 00:31:38,757
In fact, we are preparing the editor for release right now.

437
00:31:39,077 --> 00:31:43,499
It's, we told the community recently on our, the Discord channel.

438
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:47,301
So anyone who's bought the game at this point can get access to the

439
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:49,782
MechWarrior5 Mercenaries Discord channel, by the way.

440
00:31:49,823 --> 00:31:51,183
And so welcome you to come in there.

441
00:31:51,223 --> 00:31:56,666
And there's lots of good resources around joysticks support and just,

442
00:31:56,966 --> 00:31:58,167
you know, a whole bunch of things.

443
00:31:58,247 --> 00:32:01,268
There's a bunch of drop areas if you're looking for people to play co-op with.

444
00:32:02,114 --> 00:32:05,255
But one of those things is mod support channels.

445
00:32:05,475 --> 00:32:14,016
And we just let everyone know that our goal is to release the editor here sometime next week before we all break for Christmas.

446
00:32:14,937 --> 00:32:17,177
I think there's a good chance that we're going to meet that goal.

447
00:32:18,537 --> 00:32:20,258
And so basically we're going to release the editor.

448
00:32:21,378 --> 00:32:26,479
And what that will do is it'll allow mod creators to get started.

449
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:30,700
We're still going to be lacking a kind of a smooth...

450
00:32:31,318 --> 00:32:35,242
you know, end user experience for just, like, selecting and downloading mods.

451
00:32:35,302 --> 00:32:38,104
And so we're going to be working closely with Epic on that.

452
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:39,485
I'm sure we're going to be one of the...

453
00:32:40,666 --> 00:32:43,488
there's no timelines or ETAs yet on that aspect of it, but,

454
00:32:44,469 --> 00:32:47,492
you know, they're adding that kind of functionality to the Epic Games Store,

455
00:32:47,612 --> 00:32:49,133
similar to a Steamworks type of thing.

456
00:32:49,193 --> 00:32:52,656
And so we're going to be right there with them, I hope,

457
00:32:53,296 --> 00:32:55,238
being one of the first studios to support that.

458
00:32:55,861 --> 00:32:57,382
But you won't have to wait for that.

459
00:32:57,802 --> 00:33:00,763
The editor will be out soon and people can get started making mods.

460
00:33:00,823 --> 00:33:05,504
And they can still potentially share them with each other through more old-school methods.

461
00:33:05,825 --> 00:33:07,805
Like, here, take this folder, do this, do that.

462
00:33:09,346 --> 00:33:10,526
All sorts of things like that.

463
00:33:10,886 --> 00:33:14,408
And then we're going to be looking to get more of that end-user experience.

464
00:33:14,448 --> 00:33:18,109
And as soon as we can, no ETA yet on that.

465
00:33:18,589 --> 00:33:19,710
But there's the answer.

466
00:33:20,296 --> 00:33:23,738
Right on, I also need to give a shoutout to Centron for asking that question.

467
00:33:23,758 --> 00:33:27,600
I'm going to have questions about working with Epic in a bit.

468
00:33:28,821 --> 00:33:30,822
But, let's see...

469
00:33:33,383 --> 00:33:35,824
We can talk about co-op, questions like StarMix

470
00:33:36,285 --> 00:33:40,307
StarMix says they're bringing in some questions from the NGNGTV

471
00:33:40,347 --> 00:33:42,988
community stream, so shoutout to the folks at NGNGTV.

472
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:50,333
StarMacs would like to know if co-op players will be able to interact with the StarMac and MechBay in the future.

473
00:33:50,353 --> 00:33:54,115
And I guess, what was sort of the challenges of doing a co-op mode in the first place?

474
00:33:54,135 --> 00:33:58,858
Because, I mean, you know, take every problem you have making it for one player and multiply it by two.

475
00:33:58,878 --> 00:33:59,918
And that's what it sounds like to me.

476
00:34:01,259 --> 00:34:06,042
Yeah, I mean, even adding peer-to-peer co-op, it might sound simple.

477
00:34:06,202 --> 00:34:12,786
And perhaps, you know, compared to the online infrastructure that is required for something like MechWarrior Online, it is simple.

478
00:34:12,946 --> 00:34:13,127
But...

479
00:34:14,286 --> 00:34:19,770
It still makes almost every programming task that you do in the game take twice as long.

480
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:24,673
Because almost everything you do you have to make sure is ready for a co-op player and that replicates to the player.

481
00:34:25,153 --> 00:34:27,735
So it definitely added a lot of development time, a lot of complexity.

482
00:34:28,675 --> 00:34:33,759
And things like he mentions, I don't know what the likelihood of stuff like that is.

483
00:34:34,279 --> 00:34:43,125
Because you have to consider things like, well, it's not just technical requirements that we have to consider.

484
00:34:43,165 --> 00:34:43,785
We have to consider.

485
00:34:44,441 --> 00:34:50,564
The gameplay aspects like does your friend or person that you're playing the game with,

486
00:34:50,584 --> 00:34:54,426
do you want him to actually spend your C-Bills?

487
00:34:55,086 --> 00:35:00,548
Because in Instant Action, you know you, so it's not a limitation of technology because

488
00:35:00,608 --> 00:35:06,651
in Instant Action, you know, you can edit your mech, edit your loadout, edit your paint

489
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:07,772
job, all that kind of stuff.

490
00:35:08,192 --> 00:35:11,914
When it comes to playing in someone else's campaign game, you don't.

491
00:35:11,954 --> 00:35:14,015
There's a different aspect there because they have.

492
00:35:14,525 --> 00:35:18,346
certain mechs in their campaign, they don't have all mechs, and they have certain pilots,

493
00:35:18,746 --> 00:35:22,467
and you come in and you essentially take the place of one of those AI pilots, so you become,

494
00:35:23,007 --> 00:35:27,548
you know, naming AI pilot's name. It's like, okay, you're gonna be him, so play him for me,

495
00:35:28,269 --> 00:35:33,190
and play this mech, and come out in my missions with me, and help out. So you don't bring your

496
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:39,692
own stuff in, and we also didn't think that we could allow the player to adjust and spend

497
00:35:41,132 --> 00:35:43,833
the person's campaign that you're in, you know, because then...

498
00:35:44,344 --> 00:35:50,406
It's going to open up a massive can of worms of like, yeah, well, we'll put in options to say if you want to allow it or not.

499
00:35:50,506 --> 00:35:52,586
So everything's possible with time.

500
00:35:52,646 --> 00:35:59,668
But, you know, we might have had to release December 2020 if we wanted to put all of that stuff in.

501
00:35:59,728 --> 00:36:04,369
So who knows where patches or updates will go from here.

502
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:05,650
No commitments.

503
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:08,791
But I will be listening.

504
00:36:08,971 --> 00:36:12,111
And we understand, you know, people are really enjoying co-op.

505
00:36:12,998 --> 00:36:17,141
I'm sure there'll be a few, you know, there'll be some additions and adjustments, just as

506
00:36:17,181 --> 00:36:21,544
long as we're being, you know, careful and just remembering that this is, you know, it's

507
00:36:21,564 --> 00:36:26,067
not MechWarrior Online, it's a single player game that allows co-op play.

508
00:36:27,108 --> 00:36:31,051
The majority of their co-op play will probably be in instant action, but helping your buddy

509
00:36:31,111 --> 00:36:36,835
out in his campaign is certainly fun, but you just remember that you're in his campaign

510
00:36:36,875 --> 00:36:39,557
and using his C-Builds and his equipment.

511
00:36:40,504 --> 00:36:40,864
Right on.

512
00:36:40,884 --> 00:36:46,867
I'm going to get one more question from Hammerzite, which, before I move on to some other questions,

513
00:36:48,167 --> 00:36:52,469
what were the positives and negatives of experiences of developing this game?

514
00:36:52,549 --> 00:36:57,391
How did it go transitioning to a new engine, and how was it, how was the transition to

515
00:36:57,451 --> 00:36:57,751
working?

516
00:36:57,931 --> 00:36:59,031
They said, Hammerzite asks...

517
00:37:00,072 --> 00:37:07,037
How was it like transitioning to a genre where narrative was at the front and center compared to the multiplayer online, MechWarrior Online?

518
00:37:07,397 --> 00:37:13,902
I would rephrase the question as what was it like transitioning to a single player campaign, you know, just kind of a campaign thing because

519
00:37:14,322 --> 00:37:18,946
narrative may be, narrative focus may be not quite the adjective I would use.

520
00:37:19,966 --> 00:37:23,049
But I guess, you know, I like his question. What were the ups and downs of making this game?

521
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:25,090
Oh my goodness.

522
00:37:26,151 --> 00:37:27,692
In hindsight, it feels like...

523
00:37:30,785 --> 00:37:33,046
Piranha Games is not a brand new studio, right?

524
00:37:33,306 --> 00:37:34,847
We've been around now for 20 years.

525
00:37:35,387 --> 00:37:38,429
However, even making this game was still a massive challenge.

526
00:37:39,229 --> 00:37:40,350
It was very hard.

527
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:44,652
There almost was no aspect of the game that wasn't incredibly challenging.

528
00:37:44,712 --> 00:37:49,315
I mean, the base, core, mech, combat, damage model system, everything.

529
00:37:49,815 --> 00:37:53,077
That was challenging, but probably the one area that, you know, coming from MechWarrior Online,

530
00:37:53,117 --> 00:37:56,039
that was, even though we felt challenges,

531
00:37:56,319 --> 00:37:58,940
we knew where we were going and how we were going to get there.

532
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:04,679
But almost every other aspect from telling a story, which obviously MechWarrior 9 has nothing like that,

533
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:11,282
creating the AI systems, creating the procedure generated missions,

534
00:38:13,763 --> 00:38:19,806
everything at one point in the project felt extremely challenging and,

535
00:38:20,166 --> 00:38:21,787
oh my god, are we actually going to be able to do this?

536
00:38:22,007 --> 00:38:27,870
So I couldn't even narrow it down, there must be a half a dozen systems that were very, very challenging.

537
00:38:29,378 --> 00:38:34,122
There were moments during the development where you wonder if you're going to succeed

538
00:38:34,563 --> 00:38:41,948
at finishing off that item, or if you're going to have to drastically change the way the

539
00:38:41,988 --> 00:38:43,209
game works.

540
00:38:43,249 --> 00:38:45,971
So we came through, and I believe every case.

541
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:48,473
Very challenging production.

542
00:38:49,014 --> 00:38:50,215
I think that goes for a few reasons.

543
00:38:50,455 --> 00:38:56,580
A lot of CEOs might feel this way about almost every game they make, but I do think there

544
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,521
was some extra challenge here, because even though we were a...

545
00:38:59,123 --> 00:39:05,049
We're a veteran studio, we've been around for a long time, but we had been 100% in PvP

546
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:10,174
multiplayer games for the last 5-6 years previous to making MechWarrior 5.

547
00:39:10,214 --> 00:39:13,137
So, yeah, a lot of challenges in almost every area.

548
00:39:13,847 --> 00:39:17,209
I'm going to move on to some questions on my part.

549
00:39:17,249 --> 00:39:20,630
Just a heads up for folks, we've got about 20 minutes left in the stream, so if you've

550
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,050
got some questions, get them in chat.

551
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:25,092
We're going to talk about some other stuff, but we'll grab more before we're out of here.

552
00:39:26,912 --> 00:39:28,013
Let's talk about the Epic Game Store.

553
00:39:28,053 --> 00:39:29,953
This is a big new thing for the game world.

554
00:39:29,994 --> 00:39:33,775
It's been literally a year, almost a year to the day since it launched.

555
00:39:33,795 --> 00:39:38,937
That might not be entirely correct, but it's been a year since it kicked off at the...

556
00:39:39,597 --> 00:39:43,839
Right around the time of the Game Awards, Hades launched on Early Access back then,

557
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,021
and you all were able to choose to be an Epic Games Store exclusive for your launch, which is,

558
00:39:49,221 --> 00:39:54,624
you know, I think that's such an interesting decision in a world where, you know, you say,

559
00:39:54,684 --> 00:39:59,446
when you say, okay, our market is PC players, we're only going to launch on PC, and then to say,

560
00:40:01,126 --> 00:40:05,168
right now, the best choice for us is to launch on the Epic Games Store and exclusively work with

561
00:40:05,208 --> 00:40:05,348
them.

562
00:40:06,969 --> 00:40:12,391
What's that process been like and how did it feel working with Epic as a partner?

563
00:40:14,132 --> 00:40:32,260
Well, big question. I would say, you know, the jury's still out a little bit to say if, you know, 100% everything works out the way we thought it would or planned it would when we put it together.

564
00:40:32,653 --> 00:40:34,974
when we decided to take the Epic Games Store deal.

565
00:40:36,015 --> 00:40:40,537
We took it for a number of reasons, which I'll get into, but I think we still have some,

566
00:40:41,857 --> 00:40:46,339
maybe even like a few months to go here before we can say if all of it panned out like we

567
00:40:46,739 --> 00:40:47,239
hoped it might.

568
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,321
But the reason that we took it, there was...

569
00:40:52,681 --> 00:40:55,803
I've known the guys over there for quite a long time, as a lot of developers do, because

570
00:40:55,883 --> 00:40:59,364
they've been working with Unreal Engine at one time or another over long careers.

571
00:41:00,688 --> 00:41:01,948
You get to know the guys over there well.

572
00:41:02,008 --> 00:41:07,352
But we were already using Unreal 4, obviously we started development in 2016.

573
00:41:08,512 --> 00:41:13,135
And we had been a kind of company though that, you know, with MechWarrior Online,

574
00:41:13,155 --> 00:41:17,398
we've been self-publishing and selling our own games on our own portal now for years and years.

575
00:41:17,518 --> 00:41:23,261
So we were developing MechWarrior 5 not really, just kind of intending that it would be sold everywhere,

576
00:41:23,301 --> 00:41:25,002
including our own portal.

577
00:41:26,824 --> 00:41:27,604
And that was the plan.

578
00:41:28,404 --> 00:41:35,586
And there really wasn't any knowledge. I didn't even know that Epic was necessarily even doing these types of deals.

579
00:41:35,606 --> 00:41:38,147
You just started to kind of hear about it.

580
00:41:40,388 --> 00:41:42,709
Maybe I would say...

581
00:41:42,729 --> 00:41:43,849
Even in early... What? Early 2019?

582
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:48,411
You know, first quarter 2019, you start to hear about...

583
00:41:53,508 --> 00:41:56,709
I think Metro Exodus is one of the first ones I kind of heard about where it's like,

584
00:41:56,729 --> 00:42:00,410
oh, there's a thing going on here, you know, like, yeah, this is making the news.

585
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:01,590
OK, well, this is interesting.

586
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:04,851
Still didn't have any, you know, really nausea.

587
00:42:04,871 --> 00:42:05,731
We do something like that.

588
00:42:06,511 --> 00:42:10,652
At any rate, I had a conversation with Joe and it probably wasn't until

589
00:42:11,813 --> 00:42:16,674
April or May that we had our first real conversation with them

590
00:42:16,814 --> 00:42:20,675
that this came up as like, oh, there's there's there's something to consider here.

591
00:42:20,735 --> 00:42:22,035
You know, there's an opportunity. There's a.

592
00:42:22,729 --> 00:42:24,610
Now, a proposal to become one of these games.

593
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:27,191
And so for us, as any small developer

594
00:42:28,211 --> 00:42:30,733
would say, is like, well, what are the pros and cons?

595
00:42:30,793 --> 00:42:33,414
And one of the major benefits, of course, was

596
00:42:34,654 --> 00:42:37,896
we felt very strongly that we were going to be able to make a better game

597
00:42:38,196 --> 00:42:41,277
because it was going to...

598
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:44,158
Just the nature of switching over to the other store,

599
00:42:44,238 --> 00:42:47,340
changing how the co-op is going to work with the Epic Games store

600
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:51,561
and a few other things that, you know, we were going to be able to...

601
00:42:52,348 --> 00:42:57,311
We moved our release date from September to December, which was going to make it the full

602
00:42:57,411 --> 00:42:59,632
one year delay from the original release date.

603
00:43:00,453 --> 00:43:03,935
And we just had a pretty good idea of just how much extra

604
00:43:04,555 --> 00:43:07,397
quality we were going to be able to put into the game.

605
00:43:07,877 --> 00:43:10,519
So that was really the number one thing.

606
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:15,301
And then there's other deal terms that I won't get into specifics here, but there's other deal terms that make

607
00:43:15,522 --> 00:43:19,604
just add on top of that, where it removes a significant amount of risk for

608
00:43:20,244 --> 00:43:20,845
studios that...

609
00:43:21,444 --> 00:43:22,645
or perhaps even all the risk.

610
00:43:23,125 --> 00:43:25,927
And it says, well, then it almost becomes just,

611
00:43:27,689 --> 00:43:29,070
you know, a bad decision if you don't,

612
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:31,352
because we've got a situation where you can make

613
00:43:31,392 --> 00:43:33,894
a better game and remove the risk.

614
00:43:33,934 --> 00:43:36,696
And if I'm talking about the type of game that I'm making

615
00:43:36,856 --> 00:43:38,037
and who I'm making it for,

616
00:43:38,057 --> 00:43:41,320
this becomes a very easy decision

617
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,961
because I want to deliver

618
00:43:42,981 --> 00:43:45,804
the best MechWarrior 5 Mercenaries game I can.

619
00:43:45,824 --> 00:43:47,345
That's my number one priority as a developer.

620
00:43:48,366 --> 00:43:50,468
And, you know, if you do that,

621
00:43:51,437 --> 00:43:55,897
You have a lot of faith that the rest of it was going to work itself out, because all

622
00:43:55,917 --> 00:43:57,618
that really matters in the end is quality.

623
00:43:57,698 --> 00:44:01,999
People want a quality product that they can play, and they can play for a very long time.

624
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:07,440
So that really made it pretty easy for us, and we started to work on it.

625
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:10,720
And I think, in hindsight, that part has definitely worked out.

626
00:44:11,201 --> 00:44:15,241
The quality of the game is significantly higher than it would have been with an earlier release.

627
00:44:17,041 --> 00:44:19,082
And, you know, working with Epic has been good.

628
00:44:19,122 --> 00:44:21,783
They've been very, you know, very, very responsive.

629
00:44:21,823 --> 00:44:26,365
And they take care of the developers that work with them very well,

630
00:44:26,485 --> 00:44:28,766
because they understand that we're, you know,

631
00:44:28,846 --> 00:44:31,827
we're under some challenges when it comes to, you know,

632
00:44:31,867 --> 00:44:34,889
the marketplace still adapting to some of the things

633
00:44:34,909 --> 00:44:36,750
they're not happy with about the exclusivities.

634
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:41,031
And then also understanding that their store is,

635
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:43,072
you know, behind when it comes to features

636
00:44:43,232 --> 00:44:45,433
compared to the big stores like Steam.

637
00:44:45,473 --> 00:44:45,733
And so...

638
00:44:47,161 --> 00:44:50,802
They work really closely with you to prioritize the things that you need for your game

639
00:44:51,602 --> 00:44:58,184
and to, you know, just work hard to, you know, get, you know, updates as fast as they can.

640
00:44:58,284 --> 00:45:01,705
So, I think it's worked out pretty well for us.

641
00:45:01,765 --> 00:45:05,226
I'm not sure I've answered all the intricacies of your question,

642
00:45:05,246 --> 00:45:09,148
but that was... that's kind of a gist of our story on it.

643
00:45:09,288 --> 00:45:12,749
And I think, you know, for MechWarrior fans out there,

644
00:45:14,089 --> 00:45:16,190
you know, at the very least, should be...

645
00:45:17,135 --> 00:45:25,848
I think happy that the game got the amount of resources and development time that we

646
00:45:25,908 --> 00:45:31,876
were able to give it, and some of that was due to us doing that Epic Games Store deal.

647
00:45:32,644 --> 00:45:37,729
Right on, um, uh, we can address one thing that folks in chat are asking about.

648
00:45:37,849 --> 00:45:40,993
Uh, you mentioned before we started the stream that you had a new update going out today.

649
00:45:41,033 --> 00:45:42,534
It looks like that update has arrived.

650
00:45:43,315 --> 00:45:47,740
Um, uh, folks are asking where the patch notes will be posted.

651
00:45:48,001 --> 00:45:49,763
And I guess, I guess, um, what...

652
00:45:50,543 --> 00:45:53,686
We talk about the nature of making games in 2019,

653
00:45:53,786 --> 00:45:56,248
it's different than making games in 2004,

654
00:45:56,308 --> 00:45:58,150
different than making games in 1994.

655
00:45:59,431 --> 00:46:02,234
And one of the things has to be that games are not just a fixed product

656
00:46:02,274 --> 00:46:03,455
that goes on the shelves and is done.

657
00:46:03,515 --> 00:46:05,897
They have patches and notes and updates and expansions.

658
00:46:06,417 --> 00:46:08,519
And how are you all thinking about sort of...

659
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:12,022
You know, this isn't a live game, this isn't MechWarrior Online, but...

660
00:46:12,042 --> 00:46:18,228
A, I guess the first question is, to help the folks in chat out,

661
00:46:19,009 --> 00:46:21,331
what's going on with this patch? And then the follow-up question is,

662
00:46:22,332 --> 00:46:26,936
how have you sort of structured the studio to be able to keep working on MechWarrior after it launched?

663
00:46:28,857 --> 00:46:32,341
Yeah, it's a good question, because we've been really reminding ourselves of that too,

664
00:46:32,401 --> 00:46:34,803
you know, saying, okay, this is not MechWarrior Online.

665
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:38,571
It takes a lot of reminders, even for ourselves in that regard.

666
00:46:39,091 --> 00:46:43,932
But quickly, so the hotfix that just went out, this one is very small.

667
00:46:43,972 --> 00:46:46,093
The patch notes will be on the Discord channel.

668
00:46:46,753 --> 00:46:48,333
They'll be pinned there somewhere, for sure.

669
00:46:49,694 --> 00:46:56,495
And this one in particular is just a few small fixes to some of the HOTAS controllers.

670
00:46:57,415 --> 00:47:02,116
In particular, there was a crash when, if you had your HOTAS joystick...

671
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:08,501
plugged in as well as having foot pedals plugged in all at the same time it would

672
00:47:08,541 --> 00:47:14,563
cause a crash and some other like kind of related aspects so that was something

673
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:18,144
one get out right away without waiting on anything else so that's what is in

674
00:47:18,204 --> 00:47:24,365
this hotfix now it's not as confirmed yet but there's there's a plan for there

675
00:47:24,405 --> 00:47:28,786
to be another hotfix on another one this week it'll probably be on Thursday

676
00:47:29,822 --> 00:47:34,163
Possible it could slip to Friday, but I'm anticipating they'll be more like Thursday around this time

677
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:38,325
And that one's a little bigger and a little more significant. It's got

678
00:47:40,665 --> 00:47:43,086
Several crash fixes

679
00:47:45,087 --> 00:47:45,567
Some other I

680
00:47:47,327 --> 00:47:50,429
Don't have the notes in front of me, but the notes will be up on discord. But that one

681
00:47:50,449 --> 00:47:52,769
It's even got it's got some other

682
00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:55,410
fixes for the tutorial mission with some

683
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:55,930
Subs by www.zeoranger.co.uk

684
00:47:56,475 --> 00:47:58,536
optimizations we'll call it as well as some crashes.

685
00:47:58,556 --> 00:48:03,058
So there's fairly significant fixes for stability we wanted to get out into the game

686
00:48:03,718 --> 00:48:04,678
before the weekend hit.

687
00:48:05,078 --> 00:48:06,979
So look for those patch notes on Thursday.

688
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:12,501
So hopefully the larger playing numbers of the weekend will have a better time

689
00:48:12,541 --> 00:48:17,743
for us pushing out a couple of hotfixes here before the weekend hits.

690
00:48:18,723 --> 00:48:23,805
And then, you know, if everything holds, there's likely to be at least one more

691
00:48:23,905 --> 00:48:24,985
patch next week.

692
00:48:25,752 --> 00:48:31,596
The first patch is the one before we break for Christmas, target around midweek, maybe as early as Tuesday.

693
00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:43,624
That one is probably bigger than the other two combined, but basically just a number of fixes, we'll call it, before we break for Christmas.

694
00:48:43,664 --> 00:48:50,769
So, it'll be a total of three patches, and obviously the goal here is to just make sure that the game is in as good a state as possible,

695
00:48:50,809 --> 00:48:53,971
because it's been a long three years, and we're all tired, and we hope...

696
00:48:54,662 --> 00:49:00,745
We can get a nice restful Christmas break between December 20th and about January 2nd.

697
00:49:00,805 --> 00:49:05,647
So our plan is to not be fixed in the game during that period, so we want it to be working well.

698
00:49:06,607 --> 00:49:11,410
And as far as in general, we have to remind ourselves that this isn't MechWarrior Online,

699
00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:17,933
so we're not looking to do scheduled patches every two weeks like we did for the first

700
00:49:17,973 --> 00:49:20,154
several years of MechWarrior Online, and then every month after that.

701
00:49:21,053 --> 00:49:25,455
That comes down to every little tuning of every little balancing because it was a PvP game.

702
00:49:27,316 --> 00:49:32,078
This will live, you know, come the new year a little more like a traditional, you know, premium product.

703
00:49:33,939 --> 00:49:38,360
We hope there will be, you know, that we'll be launching the sales. We're like a little over 24

704
00:49:38,761 --> 00:49:44,203
hours here, so I don't think we know yet just how much of a DLC plan there will be. We'll kind of

705
00:49:44,223 --> 00:49:47,905
be dictated by how things go over here for the next few weeks. I think that's, um...

706
00:49:49,033 --> 00:49:51,455
You know, that's fair. People understand that's probably the case.

707
00:49:51,535 --> 00:49:57,279
And so, we'll be watching and waiting and we'll be designing and planning our DLC plan.

708
00:49:57,319 --> 00:50:02,762
And so, most of the updates will come through more larger DLC type situation,

709
00:50:02,862 --> 00:50:08,767
but I'm sure there'll be several planned free updates, of course, as well.

710
00:50:09,707 --> 00:50:14,351
Anything that's like a bug fix or whatever, those are going to be free updates, of course.

711
00:50:14,391 --> 00:50:14,891
Right on, right on.

712
00:50:17,301 --> 00:50:20,442
Um, yeah, uh, it's time about 1251 here.

713
00:50:20,602 --> 00:50:21,742
Uh, this footage is only, uh,

714
00:50:21,982 --> 00:50:24,623
only because I was able to play the game so much before we got here, so...

715
00:50:25,623 --> 00:50:30,185
But, you know, we got time to listen, to take your questions and talk more about Metal Warrior.

716
00:50:30,445 --> 00:50:32,645
Um, man, uh...

717
00:50:33,526 --> 00:50:37,727
Hey, uh, Russ, um, I am going to pull one question from chat.

718
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:46,965
This is kind of granular, but Doom Machine would like to know if there's anything you looked at as far as sensor ranges and enemy spawns being so close to players.

719
00:50:47,446 --> 00:50:48,507
If that's being looked into at all?

720
00:50:48,527 --> 00:50:54,231
Yeah, well at the moment we're not looking into it.

721
00:50:55,212 --> 00:50:59,695
It has been a matter that has gone through several iterations before we released.

722
00:50:59,755 --> 00:51:05,119
It's not perfect, so I think we would say we would continue to look at it.

723
00:51:06,257 --> 00:51:13,480
Basically, you've got a challenging situation where we need enemies to spawn in for the action,

724
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:16,581
but also, especially in these wave-based mission types,

725
00:51:17,081 --> 00:51:21,122
but also we're trying to account for the fact that we have up to three co-op players.

726
00:51:21,422 --> 00:51:26,724
And it's like understanding exactly where all the co-op players are and which direction

727
00:51:26,764 --> 00:51:29,505
everyone's looking is kind of tricky to make sure we get our spawn.

728
00:51:29,585 --> 00:51:34,326
So I think we have a system right now where like, you know, like 90% of the time it works great.

729
00:51:34,506 --> 00:51:34,747
And then...

730
00:51:35,473 --> 00:51:40,175
Everyone's been a while, you're like, oh, wait a minute, how did he get there that quickly?

731
00:51:40,275 --> 00:51:43,357
Like, I was just looking that way, then I turn around, there he is, 200 meters away.

732
00:51:43,937 --> 00:51:47,339
So I think it's something that will definitely go through more fine-tuning, so I think you

733
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:51,601
can, it's safe to say you can expect at least some more fine-tuning and systems like that.

734
00:51:52,102 --> 00:51:55,543
Right on, and then one more question from chat, Grace3PastryChef would like to know

735
00:51:56,324 --> 00:52:00,666
if more mission types would be coming along to help add variety to the game.

736
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:02,867
I think so.

737
00:52:02,967 --> 00:52:04,348
I think that probably...

738
00:52:05,687 --> 00:52:09,990
You know, just at first blush, you know, this early on is probably something that fits more

739
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:14,875
into a DLC type environment where, you know, we might have a DLC pack and let's say it

740
00:52:15,955 --> 00:52:21,100
will add a number of things, maybe another mini campaign and perhaps, you know, more

741
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:21,660
mission types.

742
00:52:21,761 --> 00:52:28,046
And then likely if that happens, those new mission types potentially could just kind

743
00:52:28,086 --> 00:52:30,368
of proliferate, you know, throughout the inner sphere.

744
00:52:31,657 --> 00:52:35,940
Those sort of things are not decided yet, those are design decisions that we still have to make.

745
00:52:37,221 --> 00:52:42,364
Hopefully forgive us that we really haven't had a lot of time to think about DLC yet.

746
00:52:43,065 --> 00:52:51,090
I think the big studios, the big companies, of course they'd have this dialed in 30, 60, 90 day and stuff.

747
00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:55,313
So being a small studio we need to be a little more reactionary than some.

748
00:52:56,194 --> 00:52:57,775
But hopefully it feels like we're...

749
00:52:58,464 --> 00:53:02,466
We're very close, you know, within days of being able to really sit back and go,

750
00:53:02,666 --> 00:53:08,128
okay, what's next? And there have been some of those conversations happening already in the studio,

751
00:53:08,628 --> 00:53:12,950
some of the artists, some of the designers, just a lot of brainstorming, a lot of whiteboarding,

752
00:53:12,970 --> 00:53:18,653
a lot of... but also there's still a lot of reactionary stuff for us to do, like seeing

753
00:53:18,713 --> 00:53:24,775
what people are saying. So we're just now like a day and a half into getting an idea of what,

754
00:53:25,916 --> 00:53:27,437
you know, the players feel like.

755
00:53:29,491 --> 00:53:37,394
We are making decisions over the next couple of weeks and there is no shortage of great

756
00:53:37,434 --> 00:53:40,015
ideas both internally and with the players.

757
00:53:40,516 --> 00:53:48,719
I'm sure if the game and the success justifies it because I'm sure we could work on updates

758
00:53:48,739 --> 00:53:50,340
for this game for a very long time.

759
00:53:51,229 --> 00:53:55,572
Right on. I'll follow up on that question with, you was talking there about being a small company,

760
00:53:55,612 --> 00:54:02,618
you've mentioned a few times, you know, being a 70-person team. As a CEO, I guess, like, how does

761
00:54:02,658 --> 00:54:08,522
it feel, you know, to like be making, keeping a mid-sized company alive and afloat out there in

762
00:54:08,542 --> 00:54:12,805
today's world? Is there anything you think you've done right by your team for like making them want

763
00:54:12,825 --> 00:54:15,407
to stay there and work with you, like making them, you know, not...

764
00:54:15,987 --> 00:54:20,289
Not scaling up to 200 people like what have you sort of learned like as a small shop?

765
00:54:22,789 --> 00:54:28,631
Keeping keeping your doors open and stuff. That's a vague question. I'm sorry about that. No, it's okay. No, it's a good question. I

766
00:54:29,751 --> 00:54:36,253
I'm sure it's a matter of opinion because I'm sure there's plenty of devs out there. Maybe that belong to very small

767
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:41,615
you know indie shops, and they're thinking wait a minute 70s on a small studio, but

768
00:54:42,835 --> 00:54:45,256
From my perspective it really is you know, I've

769
00:54:46,718 --> 00:54:48,119
You've been doing this 20 years now.

770
00:54:48,239 --> 00:54:51,541
We have our, so December 20th is our launch party

771
00:54:51,701 --> 00:54:53,743
and also our 20 year anniversary is our studio.

772
00:54:53,783 --> 00:54:57,485
So we've gone through all the years

773
00:54:57,545 --> 00:55:03,068
where we were 12 to 15 and to 30 to 40 to 60 to 70.

774
00:55:04,029 --> 00:55:05,410
And it's interesting, you know,

775
00:55:05,450 --> 00:55:08,191
back when we were like 40 or 50 then or 30

776
00:55:08,251 --> 00:55:10,373
and the big studios were 70.

777
00:55:11,713 --> 00:55:14,715
And now it's kind of the scaling of how much.

778
00:55:15,371 --> 00:55:17,812
Bigger things getting done and what it takes to create games.

779
00:55:18,292 --> 00:55:23,693
And now that we're 70, we really haven't climbed out of that small to mid-tier yet.

780
00:55:25,474 --> 00:55:27,054
Now those studios are 100 to 120.

781
00:55:27,234 --> 00:55:31,876
So I think we're still a small studio and I think the greatest accomplishment has been

782
00:55:31,936 --> 00:55:37,337
that we have kept an independent development studio open for 20 years.

783
00:55:37,637 --> 00:55:39,598
That is not easy.

784
00:55:39,978 --> 00:55:43,759
And if you think it is, do me a favor, go start a game studio.

785
00:55:44,646 --> 00:55:49,710
You know, have 70 staff and let me know in 20 years if you're still around.

786
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:57,255
It takes a lot to go right and a lot of hard work and we've managed to do it, which is grateful for.

787
00:55:57,275 --> 00:56:07,242
So that's the part I'm most proud of is tallying up just the number of months that I've been able to employ people

788
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:10,744
and keep them employed and be able to make games that we all like.

789
00:56:11,525 --> 00:56:11,865
So that's...

790
00:56:13,519 --> 00:56:19,845
That has been a 20 year journey, and I'm not sure where it ends yet, but not yet.

791
00:56:20,425 --> 00:56:25,790
We're going to be around for a bit longer anyhow, and we got a game to work on here,

792
00:56:25,810 --> 00:56:29,393
so I guess that's all any independent developer can ask for.

793
00:56:29,774 --> 00:56:30,054
Right on.

794
00:56:30,715 --> 00:56:33,397
We are about to close up, but I'm going to get one more question in from chat, because

795
00:56:33,437 --> 00:56:34,378
it's just such a good one.

796
00:56:34,538 --> 00:56:37,841
Ziety1 would like to know, what was a big aha moment during development?

797
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:44,212
I almost feel like this is going to be like the other one, it's like, well we had about

798
00:56:44,332 --> 00:56:50,697
ten of them and every one of them felt like, oh my god, an aha moment.

799
00:56:51,257 --> 00:56:53,739
I'll take a little bit of a different look at this to answer it.

800
00:56:56,441 --> 00:57:00,825
I'm probably going to, the way I'll answer this I think is like when we had a moment

801
00:57:00,925 --> 00:57:06,549
where it was like, aha, you know, this thing is going to work.

802
00:57:06,929 --> 00:57:08,951
You know, this thing is, it's going to happen.

803
00:57:09,808 --> 00:57:13,951
This game is coming together and I think it might even be pretty good.

804
00:57:14,652 --> 00:57:25,881
And I think that probably came, oh boy, maybe even as late as six or so months ago when

805
00:57:27,702 --> 00:57:34,207
we put together this urban test environment, city environment, which finally for the first

806
00:57:34,247 --> 00:57:35,148
time had kind of brought...

807
00:57:35,716 --> 00:57:40,458
everything together both mechs, the mech combat, turrets, the vehicles, but most importantly

808
00:57:40,978 --> 00:57:48,481
sort of a final garrison, city garrison environment where all the tall buildings and the fully

809
00:57:48,522 --> 00:57:52,463
destructible city environment that you see in some of these urban settings.

810
00:57:53,764 --> 00:57:58,646
And we were able to jump in there and we were able to play and I'm running around the city

811
00:57:59,886 --> 00:58:03,048
walking right through buildings and chasing a light mech around the city.

812
00:58:03,624 --> 00:58:06,607
As I missed, the bullets were obliterating the side of other buildings.

813
00:58:06,827 --> 00:58:10,270
And I sat back, had a big smile on my face, and I was just like,

814
00:58:11,291 --> 00:58:12,572
okay, this is gonna work.

815
00:58:12,733 --> 00:58:16,476
This is really fun, and there's really nothing else out there like it.

816
00:58:16,616 --> 00:58:20,440
And that was an a-ha moment for me to kind of give me a lot of confidence that

817
00:58:21,541 --> 00:58:23,662
there was still a ton of work to do, but that we could bring it home.

818
00:58:24,403 --> 00:58:24,683
Right on.

819
00:58:25,458 --> 00:58:29,600
And everyone in chat, folks like Commissar Punk, Thronny Joe,

820
00:58:30,761 --> 00:58:35,083
YourBloodMarauder, y'all are great, y'all are asking some great questions.

821
00:58:35,744 --> 00:58:38,625
I would ask them all for you if I had the time, but I do not.

822
00:58:38,865 --> 00:58:41,127
Sadly, time is a finite resource.

823
00:58:41,307 --> 00:58:43,248
And, you know, wait, that got a little dark.

824
00:58:43,388 --> 00:58:45,269
OK, we're going to we're going to walk away from that thread.

825
00:58:45,589 --> 00:58:47,931
Yeah. Ross, thank you so much for joining us today.

826
00:58:47,951 --> 00:58:50,492
I can see we've had some new folks join us in the last part

827
00:58:50,512 --> 00:58:52,773
of the half and sort of last few minutes.

828
00:58:53,434 --> 00:58:56,216
I would encourage you to go back and watch the earlier part of the stream.

829
00:58:56,236 --> 00:58:59,398
We're going to archive all this for you to get some other questions answered.

830
00:59:00,819 --> 00:59:03,241
For folks like Sprogue who are just coming in because of the new patch,

831
00:59:04,442 --> 00:59:06,944
Russ has already explained that those patch notes will be available in the Discord.

832
00:59:07,404 --> 00:59:10,627
Russ, is the Discord also a place where people can provide feedback

833
00:59:10,687 --> 00:59:12,408
and ask some of the great questions that they're asking?

834
00:59:13,029 --> 00:59:14,570
Yeah, there's a whole bunch of channels.

835
00:59:14,670 --> 00:59:18,933
There's feedback channels, bug report channels, everything you'd expect.

836
00:59:19,482 --> 00:59:27,768
Got it. So, uh, I wish, hmm, ah, I wish I had a link to the Discord handy I could drop in chat, but, uh, um, where's a place they can find a link to that?

837
00:59:29,909 --> 00:59:30,970
Oh boy, um...

838
00:59:32,671 --> 00:59:39,316
I'm the worst at these sort of things, um, all I know is, uh, the server name is MechWarrior5mercenaries, so...

839
00:59:40,998 --> 00:59:41,998
Yeah, you'll find it.

840
00:59:42,018 --> 00:59:47,022
Right on, I am, uh, uh, trying to...

841
00:59:47,752 --> 00:59:49,932
I'm going to find a link, and I unfortunately cannot.

842
00:59:51,213 --> 00:59:54,835
But yeah, let me see.

843
00:59:56,235 --> 01:00:00,817
Yeah, with that, sorry for stumbling over my words there, we are going to wrap things

844
01:00:00,877 --> 01:00:01,337
up for today.

845
01:00:01,377 --> 01:00:04,679
Thank you all so much for joining us.

846
01:00:05,419 --> 01:00:08,680
Russ, if they've got any questions for you, just like us devs, you know, moving away from

847
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:11,081
the fan questions, where's a good place they can reach out to you about that?

848
01:00:12,396 --> 01:00:16,781
Best places, discord channel, um, you'll see us listed there.

849
01:00:16,801 --> 01:00:21,426
I don't know how your success rate would be on direct messaging, but, um, Tina is a

850
01:00:21,446 --> 01:00:26,651
community manager and, um, usually being able to, you know, talk to her if there's,

851
01:00:26,952 --> 01:00:30,796
she can come directly to us and say, Hey, you know, here's something I think

852
01:00:30,816 --> 01:00:31,397
that was noteworthy.

853
01:00:31,437 --> 01:00:33,679
I got this question from somebody and she can ask us.

854
01:00:34,994 --> 01:00:40,399
Right on. I was able to drop the Discord link in chat for folks who do not have it yet.

855
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:43,282
And with that, we are going to wrap things up for the day.

856
01:00:43,322 --> 01:00:45,684
Thank you all so much for watching, and Russ, thank you for joining us.

857
01:00:46,605 --> 01:00:47,145
You're welcome.

858
01:00:47,405 --> 01:00:50,848
I forgot to do more of my closing spiel because I was so focused on the Discord link.

859
01:00:51,509 --> 01:00:56,491
If you are yourself a game developer interested in game development, this is GDC, the GDC Twitch channel.

860
01:00:58,112 --> 01:01:01,193
We are always here talking about the art and business of making games.

861
01:01:02,674 --> 01:01:08,096
If you happen to drop by on Friday, we're gonna be doing a stream with the folks behind Age of Empires 2 Definitive Edition.

862
01:01:08,457 --> 01:01:12,058
So I'm just spending this week reliving my 90s childhood apparently with PC games.

863
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:18,745
If you join us in the new year, we will have more streams from other great devs as we ramp up for GDC in March.

864
01:01:19,286 --> 01:01:21,528
If you're a developer yourself, we'd love to have you out at the show.

865
01:01:23,285 --> 01:01:27,948
And if you are interested in coming to the show, scroll down and you can get some info on registration.

866
01:01:28,268 --> 01:01:31,570
If you click the follow button on this channel, you will get notifications when we go live.

867
01:01:31,590 --> 01:01:33,511
And not only do we have those interviews I mentioned,

868
01:01:33,831 --> 01:01:40,655
but we will have the Game Developers Choice Awards and IGF Awards ceremonies live at the show.

869
01:01:40,816 --> 01:01:42,316
And so hopefully some other cool stuff too.

870
01:01:42,777 --> 01:01:45,658
With that, I would like to wish everyone a happy Wednesday.

871
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:48,720
And that's it. Enjoy your MEX. Enjoy blowing stuff up.

872
01:01:49,341 --> 01:01:49,621
Thank you.
