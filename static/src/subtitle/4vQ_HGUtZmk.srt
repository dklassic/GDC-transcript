1
00:00:11,452 --> 00:00:14,074
Super excited to be here everybody, but yeah.

2
00:00:14,074 --> 00:00:18,678
So first off, we're going to talk about The Last of Us Part II, and specifically about

3
00:00:18,678 --> 00:00:20,499
designing the museum level.

4
00:00:20,499 --> 00:00:28,926
We're going to cover its process from concept to composition through to production.

5
00:00:28,926 --> 00:00:30,647
First off, who the heck am I?

6
00:00:31,369 --> 00:00:33,170
My name's Evan Hill, I've been a level designer

7
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,751
for about 10 plus years.

8
00:00:35,751 --> 00:00:38,192
Obviously, I recently worked at Naughty Dog

9
00:00:38,192 --> 00:00:39,512
on The Last of Us Part II.

10
00:00:39,512 --> 00:00:42,813
Currently, I'm at Obsidian working on Outer Worlds II.

11
00:00:42,813 --> 00:00:45,234
Also worked on a couple of other things,

12
00:00:45,234 --> 00:00:47,795
but main focus for today, obviously,

13
00:00:47,795 --> 00:00:50,856
is gonna stay firmly on The Last of Us Part II.

14
00:00:50,856 --> 00:00:51,017
So.

15
00:00:52,597 --> 00:00:55,858
It has a reputation for being a pretty brutal game,

16
00:00:55,858 --> 00:00:59,439
really focused on its combat, on its stealth,

17
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:02,780
all these other really hardcore elements.

18
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,261
But I'm also really happy with how well we were able

19
00:01:05,261 --> 00:01:08,201
to display narrative and very human moments

20
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:08,862
throughout the game.

21
00:01:08,862 --> 00:01:11,282
This is gonna be focused on one of the levels that,

22
00:01:11,282 --> 00:01:13,603
I think, let us push that the furthest.

23
00:01:14,302 --> 00:01:17,184
You know, for example, shout out to Gene Park.

24
00:01:17,184 --> 00:01:20,146
This was his reaction after playing this level.

25
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:22,127
I don't apologize for possibly ruining his shirt,

26
00:01:22,127 --> 00:01:26,430
but yeah, yeah, this level connected with people

27
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:27,991
particularly well.

28
00:01:27,991 --> 00:01:30,833
We got a lot of fan art, tattoos, and the like,

29
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:33,755
and hopefully with this talk, we can kind of dig into

30
00:01:33,755 --> 00:01:35,817
some of the elements that really drove

31
00:01:35,817 --> 00:01:36,737
this connection with people.

32
00:01:36,737 --> 00:01:39,900
So yeah, that's what we're gonna be covering today.

33
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,601
This level that we designed.

34
00:01:42,601 --> 00:01:43,682
What's it about?

35
00:01:44,592 --> 00:01:46,833
So let's just start with the concept.

36
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:49,815
This level takes place three years

37
00:01:49,815 --> 00:01:53,056
before the main events of the game

38
00:01:53,056 --> 00:01:54,737
at the height of Ellie and Joel's relationship.

39
00:01:54,737 --> 00:01:57,058
It's Ellie's birthday.

40
00:01:57,058 --> 00:02:00,920
Joel is teasing her with this surprise,

41
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,001
just constantly just dangling it over her.

42
00:02:03,001 --> 00:02:04,322
She tries to guess,

43
00:02:04,322 --> 00:02:07,764
and it's focused on the interplay between the two of them,

44
00:02:07,764 --> 00:02:11,005
on him delivering this amazing birthday surprise.

45
00:02:11,836 --> 00:02:13,836
And I'm gonna lead you through how we developed

46
00:02:13,836 --> 00:02:15,897
these specific sequences,

47
00:02:15,897 --> 00:02:19,637
taking you from this super positive element

48
00:02:19,637 --> 00:02:21,318
of the relationship all the way to where

49
00:02:21,318 --> 00:02:24,018
it starts to unravel, where they start to fall apart,

50
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:26,119
and then we see where the rest of the game goes from there.

51
00:02:26,119 --> 00:02:30,379
So yeah, that's just the concept layer though.

52
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:33,020
The real meat of this talk is going to be on two parts,

53
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,640
side A and side B.

54
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,661
We're gonna cover composition, which is

55
00:02:39,078 --> 00:02:41,840
how we conceptualized all of these different elements,

56
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,101
how we actually thought about making this game,

57
00:02:44,101 --> 00:02:46,222
and how we kept evaluating it

58
00:02:46,222 --> 00:02:49,004
as it was continuing to be made.

59
00:02:49,004 --> 00:02:50,605
The real design heavy stuff.

60
00:02:50,605 --> 00:02:52,106
But that's only gonna be part of the talk.

61
00:02:52,106 --> 00:02:54,507
The other part is production.

62
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:58,690
How did we take this from idea to a shippable product?

63
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:01,991
And specifically from the lens of me as a level designer,

64
00:03:01,991 --> 00:03:03,652
kind of being in the thick of it all.

65
00:03:03,652 --> 00:03:05,613
We're not gonna necessarily focus on

66
00:03:05,613 --> 00:03:07,895
hard technical details, but just the actual.

67
00:03:08,714 --> 00:03:09,534
motions of production.

68
00:03:09,534 --> 00:03:12,816
So composition is gonna be about two thirds of this talk,

69
00:03:12,816 --> 00:03:14,396
and production's gonna be the last third.

70
00:03:14,396 --> 00:03:17,137
Got an hour, hopefully I'm gonna be able

71
00:03:17,137 --> 00:03:18,918
to fit all of this in.

72
00:03:18,918 --> 00:03:21,259
We're gonna try, but let's jump right into it.

73
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:24,741
So first off, side A, composition.

74
00:03:24,741 --> 00:03:28,822
We're gonna start with the first track,

75
00:03:28,822 --> 00:03:30,923
which is this really hot take of mine

76
00:03:30,923 --> 00:03:33,764
that is everything is story.

77
00:03:33,764 --> 00:03:35,965
Everything.

78
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,866
And the reason for this is because.

79
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:42,372
Every game is experienced one second after another.

80
00:03:42,372 --> 00:03:43,633
I don't care what you're talking about.

81
00:03:43,633 --> 00:03:47,655
You still live through the moments that you play a game,

82
00:03:47,655 --> 00:03:52,078
and as a result, you see a plot.

83
00:03:52,078 --> 00:03:53,219
You build one with yourself,

84
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:54,760
even if there's not an explicit one.

85
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,221
Playing a game is a narrative experience.

86
00:03:57,221 --> 00:04:00,563
Even without a set plot, something like Guilty Gear

87
00:04:00,563 --> 00:04:03,245
can give you narrative fulfillment, be it.

88
00:04:03,667 --> 00:04:05,828
in the structure of a match,

89
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,730
where you're just making it through

90
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,231
by the skin of your teeth,

91
00:04:09,231 --> 00:04:11,332
to longer term goals and longer term experiences,

92
00:04:11,332 --> 00:04:12,653
like improving with a character.

93
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:15,776
I see these things as deeply narrative,

94
00:04:15,776 --> 00:04:17,257
and they're emerging from their systems.

95
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,999
But the same thing can be applied to something like Valorant,

96
00:04:19,999 --> 00:04:22,981
that same story that you're experiencing

97
00:04:22,981 --> 00:04:24,262
through the matches,

98
00:04:24,262 --> 00:04:26,104
the story of progression that you're telling yourself.

99
00:04:26,104 --> 00:04:29,206
This also applies to systemic games like Rimworld,

100
00:04:29,206 --> 00:04:32,088
Crusader Kings, Dwarf Fortress.

101
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,901
The main thing to understand with this is,

102
00:04:34,901 --> 00:04:36,583
it's not about what games do,

103
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:43,148
it's how we as humans, as a species, deal with time.

104
00:04:43,148 --> 00:04:45,730
So stories themselves are these structured

105
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,471
reliances of experiences.

106
00:04:47,471 --> 00:04:50,093
And we normally think of things like movies and books,

107
00:04:50,093 --> 00:04:51,355
but just look around us.

108
00:04:51,355 --> 00:04:53,857
We have SportsCenter.

109
00:04:53,857 --> 00:04:56,419
We have the same kind of thing I was just talking about,

110
00:04:56,419 --> 00:04:59,561
but for athletic events, we have history.

111
00:04:59,561 --> 00:04:59,621
So.

112
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:04,751
It's a cool idea, but how does that help us?

113
00:05:04,751 --> 00:05:11,712
So, the main thing that this lets us do is three things.

114
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:15,093
Interesting moments, share the same anatomy,

115
00:05:15,093 --> 00:05:17,573
so we're able to analyze any type of thing

116
00:05:17,573 --> 00:05:20,654
that's not traditionally story using the same frameworks

117
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:21,534
and kind of push them around.

118
00:05:21,534 --> 00:05:23,214
For games, this is really essential

119
00:05:23,214 --> 00:05:27,075
because we're so multimedia, we're so all over the place

120
00:05:27,075 --> 00:05:28,475
in terms of the ways that we engage players

121
00:05:28,475 --> 00:05:30,216
and the ways that we push things towards them.

122
00:05:31,552 --> 00:05:33,152
It also centers the player's experience.

123
00:05:33,152 --> 00:05:36,514
Again, we're not talking about what my goal was,

124
00:05:36,514 --> 00:05:39,516
what the team's goal was, what the meta commentary is.

125
00:05:39,516 --> 00:05:42,598
It's entirely focused on the individual or the group

126
00:05:42,598 --> 00:05:47,761
that is experiencing your story, your medium, your content.

127
00:05:47,761 --> 00:05:50,702
They're the center of it, and it lets us focus on that.

128
00:05:50,702 --> 00:05:53,844
And the third thing is this benefits immensely

129
00:05:53,844 --> 00:05:55,045
from iteration.

130
00:05:55,045 --> 00:05:58,167
Like, stories themselves are these kind of

131
00:05:58,167 --> 00:06:00,908
whittling down affairs when you're making them.

132
00:06:00,908 --> 00:06:01,248
And...

133
00:06:02,675 --> 00:06:05,496
You know, it's how we got to make things like Last of Us

134
00:06:05,496 --> 00:06:06,316
as good as they are.

135
00:06:06,316 --> 00:06:08,977
Just trying and trying again, layering and layering again.

136
00:06:08,977 --> 00:06:11,757
So really quickly, let's kind of break down

137
00:06:11,757 --> 00:06:13,578
what I mean by all of that.

138
00:06:13,578 --> 00:06:15,898
All interesting moments share an anatomy.

139
00:06:15,898 --> 00:06:17,279
So I actually did a talk on this

140
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:19,159
a little more thoroughly yesterday.

141
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:20,139
You guys can check it out on the vault.

142
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:23,420
But the basic way I like to look at it

143
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,441
is using this methodology called Kishoten Kets.

144
00:06:26,441 --> 00:06:28,581
Gonna go really fast through this.

145
00:06:28,581 --> 00:06:30,982
You basically have a setup, you have a development,

146
00:06:30,982 --> 00:06:32,082
you have a twist.

147
00:06:32,352 --> 00:06:33,073
and you have a payoff.

148
00:06:33,073 --> 00:06:34,214
This is how jokes work.

149
00:06:34,214 --> 00:06:36,315
This is how most story beats work.

150
00:06:36,315 --> 00:06:38,137
Again, how a football game can even work.

151
00:06:38,137 --> 00:06:42,220
It's just a analysis of what makes things interesting.

152
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,481
You set expectations, you twist them,

153
00:06:44,481 --> 00:06:46,103
and then you pay off the consequences.

154
00:06:46,103 --> 00:06:49,365
The Mario games use this quite a bit right now.

155
00:06:49,365 --> 00:06:51,327
Mark Brown has done an amazing video

156
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:54,970
just breaking down key shot tenkets for about 15 minutes.

157
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:59,213
We're not gonna cover that here, but really recommend it.

158
00:06:59,213 --> 00:07:00,794
And yeah, centers the player's experience.

159
00:07:02,018 --> 00:07:03,740
They're the center of this universe.

160
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,722
Everything we do is to affect their subjective

161
00:07:06,722 --> 00:07:10,726
moment to moment experience in this.

162
00:07:10,726 --> 00:07:13,168
Benefits from direct iteration.

163
00:07:13,168 --> 00:07:14,049
Story is writing.

164
00:07:14,049 --> 00:07:16,611
Good writing is rewriting.

165
00:07:16,611 --> 00:07:19,253
It lets us kind of break ourselves out of this idea

166
00:07:19,253 --> 00:07:20,874
that there's a right way to do things

167
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:22,716
or a perfect version of stuff.

168
00:07:22,716 --> 00:07:24,898
We're just layering and layering and layering.

169
00:07:26,733 --> 00:07:28,854
So for some good resources on this, by the way,

170
00:07:28,854 --> 00:07:30,014
I'm gonna cover this in each section.

171
00:07:30,014 --> 00:07:32,475
I would recommend Manga and Theory in Practice

172
00:07:32,475 --> 00:07:34,555
by Hirohiko Araki, Robert McKee's story,

173
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:36,896
and the Visual Story by Bruce Block.

174
00:07:36,896 --> 00:07:38,116
Don't worry, these will be back at the end.

175
00:07:38,116 --> 00:07:42,517
Cool, that was a good idea, at least I think.

176
00:07:42,517 --> 00:07:44,538
That's why I talked about it.

177
00:07:44,538 --> 00:07:45,758
But what about the level itself?

178
00:07:45,758 --> 00:07:49,059
So goals and acts.

179
00:07:49,059 --> 00:07:53,280
These are the roots of the composition.

180
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,141
So we're...

181
00:07:56,221 --> 00:07:58,302
trying to do this thing, we're trying to make a story,

182
00:07:58,302 --> 00:08:00,802
how do we actually make sure it accomplishes

183
00:08:00,802 --> 00:08:02,063
everything else that we need this to do?

184
00:08:02,063 --> 00:08:06,304
What are we even trying to experientially accomplish?

185
00:08:06,304 --> 00:08:08,164
So we kind of started with this at a high level

186
00:08:08,164 --> 00:08:10,765
before anything else, before a pixel was pushed,

187
00:08:10,765 --> 00:08:14,586
a vert was placed, or a sentence written.

188
00:08:14,586 --> 00:08:16,907
We knew we wanted to show the high point

189
00:08:16,907 --> 00:08:18,947
of Ellie and Joel's relationship.

190
00:08:18,947 --> 00:08:20,007
We wanted the outcome of that

191
00:08:20,007 --> 00:08:22,228
to reinforce the conflict between them.

192
00:08:22,228 --> 00:08:25,569
We wanted to create compelling gameplay without combat.

193
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:27,152
We want to have emotional impact,

194
00:08:27,152 --> 00:08:28,633
and we also want to teach the player how to swim.

195
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:33,897
But the next step is that we have to find moments

196
00:08:33,897 --> 00:08:35,538
to meet our goals.

197
00:08:35,538 --> 00:08:38,460
What's this rough evaluation that we're then finding

198
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,761
to accomplish all of this?

199
00:08:40,761 --> 00:08:45,244
So what's the story is really what we're asking.

200
00:08:45,244 --> 00:08:50,848
What sequence of events can do all of this

201
00:08:50,848 --> 00:08:52,229
and still be interesting?

202
00:08:52,229 --> 00:08:53,770
We're not just doing a checklist.

203
00:08:54,702 --> 00:08:57,263
We broke this into three different acts

204
00:08:57,263 --> 00:08:58,724
at a pretty early stage,

205
00:08:58,724 --> 00:09:01,365
using the same kind of framework I just covered.

206
00:09:01,365 --> 00:09:04,327
Setup, development, twist, payoff.

207
00:09:04,327 --> 00:09:07,068
Three really simple acts,

208
00:09:07,068 --> 00:09:09,249
break down the story as quickly as we can.

209
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:11,610
First was hike to the surprise.

210
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:14,032
We'd come in three years earlier.

211
00:09:14,032 --> 00:09:16,873
Joel's teasing Ellie about whatever the surprise is.

212
00:09:16,873 --> 00:09:18,194
She gets annoying.

213
00:09:18,194 --> 00:09:20,375
He shoves her into a river.

214
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:23,596
And we suddenly teach the player how to swim.

215
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:24,117
So again.

216
00:09:24,545 --> 00:09:27,705
We set it up, we developed it, big twist, you're in a river.

217
00:09:27,705 --> 00:09:29,546
Oh, Ellie can swim, great.

218
00:09:29,546 --> 00:09:32,106
I've taught you, we're now able to move on.

219
00:09:32,106 --> 00:09:35,227
They move further, she shoves him into the river,

220
00:09:35,227 --> 00:09:39,208
gets him back, and as they're continuing on,

221
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:41,588
you know, this tension keeps building and building

222
00:09:41,588 --> 00:09:43,849
until the big reveal.

223
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:46,169
He's taken her to a natural history museum,

224
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:47,109
blows her tiny mind.

225
00:09:47,109 --> 00:09:49,370
You've, you even as the player,

226
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:51,110
you've mostly just been focused on that back and forth

227
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:51,750
between the two of them.

228
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,171
You forgot pretty much about the surprise itself.

229
00:09:54,723 --> 00:09:57,265
But then we get to the meat of it, exploring the museum.

230
00:09:57,265 --> 00:10:01,827
We enter into this new space, this seemingly impossible

231
00:10:01,827 --> 00:10:05,669
thing, just out in the middle of the woods as far as we knew.

232
00:10:05,669 --> 00:10:08,630
And they bond.

233
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:14,293
They get to have this, frankly, magical moment where

234
00:10:14,293 --> 00:10:15,513
everything else melts away.

235
00:10:15,513 --> 00:10:17,394
They just get to be.

236
00:10:17,394 --> 00:10:19,375
They go to the space area.

237
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:22,476
Joel doubles down, shows that his surprise wasn't even

238
00:10:22,476 --> 00:10:22,917
done yet.

239
00:10:23,388 --> 00:10:27,690
He's recorded a recording of the Apollo missions,

240
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:29,070
which again, internet's gone.

241
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:31,511
Nobody's ever heard about this for a while,

242
00:10:31,511 --> 00:10:34,353
or at least been able to hear it.

243
00:10:34,353 --> 00:10:35,533
Ellie's ecstatic.

244
00:10:35,533 --> 00:10:37,874
This moment itself, like you can look at it

245
00:10:37,874 --> 00:10:39,015
as that high point, as that moment

246
00:10:39,015 --> 00:10:42,957
where they're at their best, and then they move on.

247
00:10:45,517 --> 00:10:48,860
Ellie's curiosity to keep the good times rolling,

248
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:51,483
her drive to see everything,

249
00:10:51,483 --> 00:10:52,784
gets them to check out this other building

250
00:10:52,784 --> 00:10:54,265
that Joel hasn't explored.

251
00:10:54,265 --> 00:10:57,428
Of course, they get separated.

252
00:10:57,428 --> 00:11:03,334
She gets lost, winds up in a dark, spooky place,

253
00:11:03,334 --> 00:11:07,698
and as you and her are starting to get eked out,

254
00:11:07,698 --> 00:11:10,441
gets attacked by a boar.

255
00:11:13,448 --> 00:11:17,331
Not actually any real threat, just really shaking.

256
00:11:17,331 --> 00:11:20,834
But in the midst of this, she also finds

257
00:11:20,834 --> 00:11:24,557
a piece of graffiti that really catches her attention.

258
00:11:24,557 --> 00:11:29,241
Joel busts in, see if everything's okay.

259
00:11:29,241 --> 00:11:31,382
You know, no threat, no infected,

260
00:11:31,382 --> 00:11:35,425
but something that reminds them

261
00:11:35,425 --> 00:11:37,567
of the other problems that they have.

262
00:11:37,567 --> 00:11:40,409
That the events of the first game still happened,

263
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:40,790
and that...

264
00:11:43,179 --> 00:11:44,720
Joel is still lying to her.

265
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,581
She doesn't know about what,

266
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:49,282
but she knows he's hiding something.

267
00:11:49,282 --> 00:11:54,925
And this then leads to their unraveling.

268
00:11:54,925 --> 00:11:57,206
So yeah, pretty straightforward.

269
00:11:57,206 --> 00:11:58,966
Just a recap of the story,

270
00:11:58,966 --> 00:12:03,068
but hopefully you can see how we kind of stack these

271
00:12:03,068 --> 00:12:04,769
on top of each other to create that rhythm,

272
00:12:04,769 --> 00:12:05,529
to create that pulse,

273
00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:09,511
to accomplish everything we tried to do and deliver it.

274
00:12:09,511 --> 00:12:12,152
It's delicious, it's great.

275
00:12:12,152 --> 00:12:12,873
Good storytelling.

276
00:12:13,404 --> 00:12:15,785
Nothing crazy.

277
00:12:15,785 --> 00:12:16,746
That's cool.

278
00:12:16,746 --> 00:12:20,948
But how did we actually find and develop these moments?

279
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:23,029
Like, I just gave you a list.

280
00:12:23,029 --> 00:12:25,410
I didn't tell you how I got there.

281
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,691
So let's go into that.

282
00:12:27,691 --> 00:12:28,872
Track three, characters.

283
00:12:28,872 --> 00:12:32,493
The main thing to understand

284
00:12:32,493 --> 00:12:34,894
about our style of storytelling at Naughty Dog,

285
00:12:34,894 --> 00:12:36,075
and mine personally,

286
00:12:36,075 --> 00:12:37,596
is we try to work from this premise

287
00:12:37,596 --> 00:12:40,697
that characters drive the story's beats.

288
00:12:40,697 --> 00:12:41,898
Everything we just described

289
00:12:42,183 --> 00:12:45,745
was due to an action of these characters.

290
00:12:45,745 --> 00:12:47,926
Joel is the one giving the surprise.

291
00:12:47,926 --> 00:12:49,166
Ellie is the one reacting.

292
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:50,987
Ellie pushes forward into the annex.

293
00:12:50,987 --> 00:12:54,048
All of these things, it's pretty basic,

294
00:12:54,048 --> 00:12:57,189
but they're driven by what these characters want

295
00:12:57,189 --> 00:12:58,450
and who they are.

296
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:02,211
So we understand that characters drive the story's beats,

297
00:13:02,211 --> 00:13:03,512
but what drives them?

298
00:13:03,512 --> 00:13:06,153
We need to understand the people coming along with us

299
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:08,834
into the story.

300
00:13:08,834 --> 00:13:10,394
And how do we do that?

301
00:13:10,394 --> 00:13:10,915
Break it down.

302
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:14,411
First, we do things like look at their character history.

303
00:13:14,411 --> 00:13:17,371
Who are they and what have they been through?

304
00:13:17,371 --> 00:13:19,352
This is Ellie and Joel.

305
00:13:19,352 --> 00:13:24,613
They have been through an entire The Last of Us together.

306
00:13:24,613 --> 00:13:29,014
All of that, their trauma, their grief,

307
00:13:29,014 --> 00:13:30,754
got resolved in the end of that.

308
00:13:30,754 --> 00:13:33,955
They are thinking that they are living

309
00:13:33,955 --> 00:13:34,995
their happily ever after.

310
00:13:34,995 --> 00:13:40,016
Game's done, Ellie was saved, no cure,

311
00:13:40,016 --> 00:13:40,856
bit of a loss, but.

312
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:43,350
They're trying to move forward.

313
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:44,511
They're both looking to the future.

314
00:13:44,511 --> 00:13:47,992
Since we understand these contexts,

315
00:13:47,992 --> 00:13:49,132
and this covers everything else with them,

316
00:13:49,132 --> 00:13:50,693
their personality, their history,

317
00:13:50,693 --> 00:13:54,194
Joel's from Austin, Ellie's grew up mostly in Boston,

318
00:13:54,194 --> 00:13:56,255
different vibes, but the main thing

319
00:13:56,255 --> 00:13:57,815
that this character history gives us

320
00:13:57,815 --> 00:14:00,916
is it helps us understand what these characters want.

321
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:03,737
And then we are able to take those wants

322
00:14:03,737 --> 00:14:05,298
and drive them into actions.

323
00:14:05,298 --> 00:14:06,118
So, quick breakdown.

324
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:09,732
Joel's main want in this scene, in this flashback,

325
00:14:09,732 --> 00:14:11,194
is he wants to live the life he had

326
00:14:11,194 --> 00:14:13,095
before he lost Sarah with Ellie.

327
00:14:13,095 --> 00:14:13,976
And he's getting to do that.

328
00:14:13,976 --> 00:14:15,477
He's a dad again.

329
00:14:15,477 --> 00:14:19,201
He's got the daughter, shaped hole in his heart, filled.

330
00:14:19,201 --> 00:14:22,544
Ellie wants to see the world progress again.

331
00:14:22,544 --> 00:14:28,389
She grew up really, really harshly,

332
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:31,171
and now has experienced what she sees

333
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:32,312
as the only bit of stability.

334
00:14:33,575 --> 00:14:35,537
She's very much on the pro like,

335
00:14:35,537 --> 00:14:37,138
oh hey, the world can actually be good though.

336
00:14:37,138 --> 00:14:41,041
Imagine that.

337
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:42,482
And you know, her love of space and science,

338
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:44,043
always looking ahead, kind of reflect this.

339
00:14:44,043 --> 00:14:45,785
But then we take the next layer,

340
00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:48,567
which is this is what these people want on the surface.

341
00:14:48,567 --> 00:14:50,568
This is their most primary drive.

342
00:14:50,568 --> 00:14:55,212
But they also have secret wants.

343
00:14:55,212 --> 00:14:58,114
Joel's pretty simple.

344
00:14:58,358 --> 00:15:00,399
wants to keep hiding the truth about the fireflies.

345
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,720
That man does not want anybody to know what he did.

346
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,160
Does not want Ellie to know what he did.

347
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,941
Ellie still secretly wants to know what happened.

348
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:13,522
You know, they have these two aligning superficial goals

349
00:15:13,522 --> 00:15:16,483
that let them bond, let them really

350
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:17,843
just become a family unit,

351
00:15:17,843 --> 00:15:20,924
but that core tension underneath

352
00:15:20,924 --> 00:15:23,345
that we get to tug out at the end

353
00:15:23,345 --> 00:15:24,265
shows how they unravel.

354
00:15:24,265 --> 00:15:27,486
How they go from there to here.

355
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,379
So yeah, the secret wants come forward,

356
00:15:30,379 --> 00:15:32,481
unravel both of them, Joel starts to lose Ellie.

357
00:15:32,481 --> 00:15:35,342
Ellie fears she misses her chance to matter.

358
00:15:35,342 --> 00:15:37,103
She's starting to kind of question and worry.

359
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,545
It's like, wait, what part was he lying about?

360
00:15:39,545 --> 00:15:44,527
And yeah, the best way to think about this too

361
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:46,969
is that story isn't picking words.

362
00:15:46,969 --> 00:15:51,591
It's finding the actions that bring characters to life.

363
00:15:51,591 --> 00:15:52,652
So how do we go about doing that?

364
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:55,433
We're not trying to sit down necessarily

365
00:15:55,433 --> 00:15:57,875
and type out a script or just bunker up.

366
00:15:58,355 --> 00:15:59,776
One of the things that I really liked

367
00:15:59,776 --> 00:16:00,957
with our process at Naughty Dog

368
00:16:00,957 --> 00:16:05,019
is it was very kind of focused on acting in improv.

369
00:16:05,019 --> 00:16:08,200
So we would just brainstorm, feel it out,

370
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,501
play as the characters, use all of this knowledge

371
00:16:10,501 --> 00:16:12,883
and history to just come up with dumb moments.

372
00:16:12,883 --> 00:16:16,044
Like it turns out, a lot of Naughty Dog is ex-theater kids.

373
00:16:16,044 --> 00:16:19,446
And if you were to just like pop into the office,

374
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:20,867
somebody would probably be rolling on the ground,

375
00:16:20,867 --> 00:16:22,247
other people would be using voices,

376
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:24,188
they'd be having fake shouting arguments,

377
00:16:24,188 --> 00:16:26,329
but you know, can't really show that here.

378
00:16:28,883 --> 00:16:31,865
But yeah, it honestly though, like that approach

379
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:34,506
is what I think got us some of these

380
00:16:34,506 --> 00:16:35,847
like very lively feeling moments.

381
00:16:35,847 --> 00:16:37,568
We didn't pre-plan a script,

382
00:16:37,568 --> 00:16:40,069
we just worked from the characters,

383
00:16:40,069 --> 00:16:42,031
tried to actually imagine what they would do

384
00:16:42,031 --> 00:16:43,631
in these situations.

385
00:16:43,631 --> 00:16:46,353
So yeah, if you guys want some more resources on characters

386
00:16:46,353 --> 00:16:48,154
and how we kind of built all of this out,

387
00:16:48,154 --> 00:16:50,895
we've got the Art of Dramatic Writing by Lagross Angry,

388
00:16:50,895 --> 00:16:53,317
Creating Character Arcs by K.M. Weiland,

389
00:16:53,317 --> 00:16:55,278
and of course, Robert McKee's story.

390
00:16:55,278 --> 00:16:55,558
So that's cool.

391
00:16:59,082 --> 00:17:03,263
But what about the player?

392
00:17:03,263 --> 00:17:04,123
Let's talk about gameplay.

393
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:08,524
So I've mostly just talked about what happens,

394
00:17:08,524 --> 00:17:10,205
who these characters are.

395
00:17:10,205 --> 00:17:12,985
This is a game, there's a player,

396
00:17:12,985 --> 00:17:15,546
there's somebody that is in the room with us

397
00:17:15,546 --> 00:17:18,847
that isn't there until the game ships.

398
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,667
So how do we bring them into this experience?

399
00:17:20,667 --> 00:17:24,988
How do we involve them in this thing that we're doing?

400
00:17:24,988 --> 00:17:26,428
This is acting, this is improv.

401
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:31,490
Simplest way that I've been able to articulate this

402
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:34,251
is we approached it as if the player is an actor

403
00:17:34,251 --> 00:17:34,751
that we cast as Ellie.

404
00:17:34,751 --> 00:17:39,172
That means that this person, this performer,

405
00:17:39,172 --> 00:17:41,892
collaborating with Ashley Johnson basically,

406
00:17:41,892 --> 00:17:44,353
has the agency to drive her actions.

407
00:17:44,353 --> 00:17:46,313
They might not be able to branch

408
00:17:46,313 --> 00:17:48,173
and decide what those actions are,

409
00:17:48,173 --> 00:17:49,434
they're still the impulse.

410
00:17:49,434 --> 00:17:51,054
They are still the one doing this.

411
00:17:51,054 --> 00:17:53,194
They are acting from a script basically.

412
00:17:53,194 --> 00:17:54,074
That's how acting works.

413
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:55,475
You don't go on stage and

414
00:17:56,322 --> 00:18:01,866
do a choose your own adventure play, you do your part.

415
00:18:01,866 --> 00:18:02,907
They are the impulse.

416
00:18:02,907 --> 00:18:06,810
They get to decide though still, some decisions,

417
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:09,372
the timing and the tone of those decisions.

418
00:18:09,372 --> 00:18:12,374
They get to decide the what, the when, the why,

419
00:18:12,374 --> 00:18:16,457
and it takes us to the next part.

420
00:18:16,457 --> 00:18:19,019
We also want to ensure that these decisions,

421
00:18:19,019 --> 00:18:21,421
these choices we're giving the player,

422
00:18:21,421 --> 00:18:22,882
provide emotional expression.

423
00:18:22,882 --> 00:18:24,963
They are either letting them,

424
00:18:25,743 --> 00:18:29,566
facilitate or express an emotion that they think Ellie should have.

425
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:35,110
So they also get to let her explore her different reactions.

426
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:38,393
So I can press a button going like, oh, I wonder what Ellie's going to do with this,

427
00:18:38,393 --> 00:18:42,396
and then get surprised, get this feedback that it's like, oh, she's going to make a

428
00:18:42,396 --> 00:18:43,156
stupid joke.

429
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:45,318
She's going to get on Joel's nerves.

430
00:18:45,318 --> 00:18:46,199
I want to see that.

431
00:18:46,199 --> 00:18:47,320
I align myself with that.

432
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:52,444
I'm exploring this character interactively in a way that, you know, it's not quite acting,

433
00:18:52,444 --> 00:18:53,885
but it's, I think, something.

434
00:18:54,659 --> 00:18:55,960
enriching nonetheless.

435
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,560
And then the final part is feedback.

436
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,401
So we have agency, expression,

437
00:19:01,401 --> 00:19:02,862
but the next part is yes-anding,

438
00:19:02,862 --> 00:19:05,603
is like taking what the player's trying to do

439
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:06,683
and saying, oh, that's cool.

440
00:19:06,683 --> 00:19:09,864
Also, developing it, throwing it back.

441
00:19:09,864 --> 00:19:12,285
Again, kind of going back to this improv framework

442
00:19:12,285 --> 00:19:12,985
that we're working from.

443
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,746
It also then drives the next expression.

444
00:19:15,746 --> 00:19:17,307
It drives the next decision for the player.

445
00:19:17,307 --> 00:19:19,248
You're actually having a back and forth

446
00:19:19,248 --> 00:19:21,848
instead of, I don't know, filling out a spreadsheet

447
00:19:21,848 --> 00:19:23,489
or going on a hike.

448
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:27,999
And some examples of this that we can kind of cover are,

449
00:19:27,999 --> 00:19:31,142
you are the real person to press the button

450
00:19:31,142 --> 00:19:32,303
to shove Joel into the water.

451
00:19:32,303 --> 00:19:33,364
It isn't a cut scene.

452
00:19:33,364 --> 00:19:36,066
It's not perfectly timed or canned.

453
00:19:36,066 --> 00:19:37,748
It's whatever you feel like it.

454
00:19:37,748 --> 00:19:39,349
Whenever you, honestly, as the player,

455
00:19:39,349 --> 00:19:43,192
I think he's expecting it the least.

456
00:19:43,192 --> 00:19:46,295
That way you get that bit of extra satisfaction.

457
00:19:46,295 --> 00:19:49,458
Same thing with the swimming.

458
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:53,110
Really simple, but just this exploration of a new mechanic.

459
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,991
Up until this point, you've not been able to swim

460
00:19:54,991 --> 00:19:57,011
in this game, we're at about like eight hours in,

461
00:19:57,011 --> 00:20:00,752
you get a new expressive way to navigate the environment,

462
00:20:00,752 --> 00:20:02,212
learning things like diving underwater.

463
00:20:02,212 --> 00:20:05,433
You can also find some secret stuff,

464
00:20:05,433 --> 00:20:06,613
like climbing on the dinosaur,

465
00:20:06,613 --> 00:20:10,194
just being this reckless kid,

466
00:20:10,194 --> 00:20:11,754
clambering up the nearest cool thing

467
00:20:11,754 --> 00:20:13,595
that she finds when she's excited,

468
00:20:13,595 --> 00:20:16,495
and getting to, again, like emotionally express that,

469
00:20:16,495 --> 00:20:19,316
getting to just align with the performance

470
00:20:20,289 --> 00:20:21,590
She's just jazzed to be there.

471
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,511
She's actually also kind of happy

472
00:20:22,511 --> 00:20:25,654
that she's screwing with Joel.

473
00:20:25,654 --> 00:20:29,116
Or her finding a hat, messing around,

474
00:20:29,116 --> 00:20:31,879
going into the back rooms, cracking jokes.

475
00:20:31,879 --> 00:20:32,719
These are all optional.

476
00:20:32,719 --> 00:20:35,962
These aren't essential to her performance,

477
00:20:35,962 --> 00:20:37,984
but they're things that you as a player

478
00:20:37,984 --> 00:20:39,945
get to own having added to the performance.

479
00:20:39,945 --> 00:20:41,787
You're the one who has decided that,

480
00:20:41,787 --> 00:20:43,228
like, yeah, this is Ellie.

481
00:20:43,228 --> 00:20:44,609
This is who she is.

482
00:20:44,609 --> 00:20:47,031
You're collaborating with us.

483
00:20:47,031 --> 00:20:49,073
You're adding to the scene

484
00:20:49,073 --> 00:20:49,513
rather than just...

485
00:20:50,942 --> 00:20:53,683
doing it by rote.

486
00:20:53,683 --> 00:20:55,664
And yeah, that's just how we approached

487
00:20:55,664 --> 00:20:57,325
a lot of these small sections,

488
00:20:57,325 --> 00:20:59,646
putting hats on the dinosaurs, putting the hats on Joel,

489
00:20:59,646 --> 00:21:01,187
even going back to emotional expression,

490
00:21:01,187 --> 00:21:03,688
literally letting you just go into a mirror

491
00:21:03,688 --> 00:21:04,989
and make stupid faces.

492
00:21:04,989 --> 00:21:09,091
Can't get any more direct than that.

493
00:21:09,091 --> 00:21:12,392
Choosing your hats, deciding how long you want to examine

494
00:21:12,392 --> 00:21:13,833
this gift that Joel's given you,

495
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:17,875
you're the one to jump off, move forward.

496
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,636
And then when things start taking a turn.

497
00:21:20,753 --> 00:21:22,234
There's nothing at all in the game

498
00:21:22,234 --> 00:21:24,736
asking you to turn on your flashlight or crouch,

499
00:21:24,736 --> 00:21:26,917
pretend that it's, you know, you're in danger.

500
00:21:26,917 --> 00:21:29,638
You're the one doing that as the player.

501
00:21:29,638 --> 00:21:31,659
You're embodying these emotions.

502
00:21:31,659 --> 00:21:34,221
By this point, we've gotten you so deep in

503
00:21:34,221 --> 00:21:36,942
that you're not really consciously doing this,

504
00:21:36,942 --> 00:21:39,344
but all the same, you're providing the performance.

505
00:21:39,344 --> 00:21:43,026
You're providing the emotional alignment

506
00:21:43,026 --> 00:21:44,326
that Ellie is then acting out in the game.

507
00:21:44,326 --> 00:21:45,827
So yeah, that's how we approach this gameplay.

508
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:52,862
The player is an actor cast as Ellie.

509
00:21:52,862 --> 00:21:55,943
If you want more resources on this,

510
00:21:55,943 --> 00:21:57,824
I would recommend Directing Actors by Judas Wetson,

511
00:21:57,824 --> 00:22:02,167
Manga and Theory in Practice by Hirohiko Araki,

512
00:22:02,167 --> 00:22:03,768
and of course, Story by Robert McKee.

513
00:22:03,768 --> 00:22:06,409
I told you they'd be back.

514
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:08,891
But again, that's cool.

515
00:22:08,891 --> 00:22:12,393
But how does the player know all of this?

516
00:22:13,167 --> 00:22:14,728
We have all this elaborate plan for them.

517
00:22:14,728 --> 00:22:18,190
We've tried to convince them to be an actor

518
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:20,112
in our weird digital stage play,

519
00:22:20,112 --> 00:22:21,793
but we didn't send them a script.

520
00:22:21,793 --> 00:22:25,735
We didn't let them know that this was going on.

521
00:22:25,735 --> 00:22:28,737
How does this work?

522
00:22:28,737 --> 00:22:34,161
The simple answer is level design.

523
00:22:34,161 --> 00:22:36,642
So the way we try to use level design in this scene

524
00:22:36,642 --> 00:22:39,624
is that space informs the player of direction and mood.

525
00:22:40,697 --> 00:22:42,438
It lets them perform without that script.

526
00:22:42,438 --> 00:22:46,860
It lets them actually just kinda take it by vibes.

527
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,161
Just do what feels natural.

528
00:22:48,161 --> 00:22:51,382
And all of a sudden, hey, you're playing by the script.

529
00:22:51,382 --> 00:22:55,445
Of course, any game you can just stand perfectly still,

530
00:22:55,445 --> 00:22:58,366
spin around in a circle for three hours,

531
00:22:58,366 --> 00:23:00,367
or walk in the opposite direction and turn it off.

532
00:23:00,367 --> 00:23:03,389
But that simple bit of collaboration

533
00:23:03,389 --> 00:23:06,510
really breeds that rhythm, that momentum

534
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,392
where all of a sudden you as a player are.

535
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,301
buying into the script, taking the stage directions,

536
00:23:13,301 --> 00:23:16,202
you're performing, you're the person we need you to be.

537
00:23:16,202 --> 00:23:17,283
So how do we do this?

538
00:23:17,283 --> 00:23:21,226
Main things we need are clear information.

539
00:23:21,226 --> 00:23:24,207
This is much more than just paint the path forward yellow.

540
00:23:24,207 --> 00:23:26,008
That's all really, really useful.

541
00:23:26,008 --> 00:23:28,550
You know, as you guys have seen those examples

542
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:30,631
where we'll just have a piece of caution tape

543
00:23:30,631 --> 00:23:33,113
fluttering in the wind to let you know where to progress.

544
00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:37,412
It's also about what types of things to expect,

545
00:23:37,412 --> 00:23:39,654
whether you're driving navigation or not,

546
00:23:39,654 --> 00:23:41,476
whether you're in danger or not.

547
00:23:41,476 --> 00:23:43,138
All of these other subtle cues

548
00:23:43,138 --> 00:23:45,760
really come into this idea of clear information.

549
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,142
And that you need to look at this

550
00:23:47,142 --> 00:23:49,104
as like this informing of the player

551
00:23:49,104 --> 00:23:51,406
is much more than just where to go.

552
00:23:51,406 --> 00:23:52,968
And also, it's a difficult balancing act

553
00:23:52,968 --> 00:23:55,190
because too much information can be bad.

554
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,361
I mean, we look at over cluttered UI,

555
00:23:58,361 --> 00:24:01,702
we look at levels where the noise and the balance

556
00:24:01,702 --> 00:24:03,163
is just not really there.

557
00:24:03,163 --> 00:24:04,723
Even if I might tactically be able to understand

558
00:24:04,723 --> 00:24:07,664
where I'm going, it's not giving me a mood.

559
00:24:07,664 --> 00:24:10,005
Second thing we need is variety.

560
00:24:10,005 --> 00:24:12,906
Aesthetics, verticality, traversal and interaction.

561
00:24:12,906 --> 00:24:17,488
All of these different things that just provide contrast.

562
00:24:18,743 --> 00:24:20,965
It's cool, but the real thing that it's useful for

563
00:24:20,965 --> 00:24:23,687
is it also increases the memorability of information.

564
00:24:23,687 --> 00:24:25,869
It lets you navigate better, it lets you segment,

565
00:24:25,869 --> 00:24:28,891
it lets you kinda get everything from palette cleansers

566
00:24:28,891 --> 00:24:31,774
to new directions, emotional shifts.

567
00:24:31,774 --> 00:24:33,395
Again, you're directing this player here.

568
00:24:33,395 --> 00:24:36,037
And the third thing is mood and impact.

569
00:24:36,037 --> 00:24:39,320
Impression, immersion, and anything else

570
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,380
that's emotionally focused.

571
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:44,784
You know, we're giving you the mechanical process

572
00:24:44,784 --> 00:24:45,985
of what to do, where to go.

573
00:24:47,573 --> 00:24:50,055
We need to focus too on what these emotions are.

574
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:50,836
What should you be feeling?

575
00:24:50,836 --> 00:24:52,457
And I think it's so important

576
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:54,939
that it's like I've separated this out.

577
00:24:54,939 --> 00:24:57,281
We really need to get people to embody into the space,

578
00:24:57,281 --> 00:24:58,442
to buy into the emotions,

579
00:24:58,442 --> 00:25:00,003
and we signal a lot of that

580
00:25:00,003 --> 00:25:02,124
with all the techniques and level design.

581
00:25:02,124 --> 00:25:02,725
That's why we're here.

582
00:25:02,725 --> 00:25:05,847
So everything from bright sunny days,

583
00:25:05,847 --> 00:25:07,609
Joel leading you around

584
00:25:07,609 --> 00:25:10,811
as you're being teased about this thing.

585
00:25:10,811 --> 00:25:12,832
As you go in, an example here is,

586
00:25:12,832 --> 00:25:16,535
Joel's leading you this whole way, and then he stops.

587
00:25:17,985 --> 00:25:19,627
He just chills out and says,

588
00:25:19,627 --> 00:25:22,769
I'm not gonna tell you anything else.

589
00:25:22,769 --> 00:25:24,831
And this is when we actually provide the reveal.

590
00:25:24,831 --> 00:25:29,214
If we go back here, there's actually multiple different ways

591
00:25:29,214 --> 00:25:29,975
you can approach this thing.

592
00:25:29,975 --> 00:25:32,837
We made sure this did perfectly each and every path.

593
00:25:32,837 --> 00:25:35,118
But the key thing, going back to everything

594
00:25:35,118 --> 00:25:36,500
we've been talking about,

595
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,881
suddenly the player's in a situation

596
00:25:37,881 --> 00:25:39,462
where they don't know what's gonna happen next.

597
00:25:39,462 --> 00:25:39,922
They know what to do.

598
00:25:39,922 --> 00:25:45,587
They understand the emotional context of what's happening.

599
00:25:46,484 --> 00:25:47,925
And the moment that happens afterwards,

600
00:25:47,925 --> 00:25:49,366
despite it being exactly to the script

601
00:25:49,366 --> 00:25:50,307
that we wanted to make,

602
00:25:50,307 --> 00:25:55,010
gets to feel like their contribution to the story.

603
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:56,091
Just running through some other things.

604
00:25:56,091 --> 00:26:00,914
We do this with letting the dinosaurs

605
00:26:00,914 --> 00:26:03,876
be these interaction points for the player.

606
00:26:03,876 --> 00:26:06,238
We show one-off, and then we show that,

607
00:26:06,238 --> 00:26:08,199
oh, the player has dozens of options.

608
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:09,881
All these different ways that they can keep

609
00:26:09,881 --> 00:26:10,921
adding to this performance.

610
00:26:12,913 --> 00:26:15,495
We shift gears, we change aesthetics,

611
00:26:15,495 --> 00:26:18,716
we make things claustrophobic or big.

612
00:26:18,716 --> 00:26:21,577
We provide really clear framing on where to go here.

613
00:26:21,577 --> 00:26:25,439
Like, if you pay attention, you can probably figure out,

614
00:26:25,439 --> 00:26:27,960
like, oh, hey, let's head through that window,

615
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,560
jump down these bars.

616
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:33,322
And then, even more importantly, when we get to the annex,

617
00:26:33,322 --> 00:26:36,663
I just fuck with people.

618
00:26:36,663 --> 00:26:39,805
I put down collectibles.

619
00:26:39,805 --> 00:26:40,925
I put down crafting objects.

620
00:26:41,928 --> 00:26:45,950
All of the cover here is valid combat cover,

621
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:46,710
even without enemies.

622
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,752
Using all of these subconscious cues

623
00:26:48,752 --> 00:26:51,913
to just signal to the player like, hey, watch out.

624
00:26:51,913 --> 00:26:55,235
And unsurprisingly, players do.

625
00:26:55,235 --> 00:26:55,916
They follow along.

626
00:26:55,916 --> 00:26:59,297
They really kind of shift into the mood

627
00:26:59,297 --> 00:27:00,098
that I'm asking them to.

628
00:27:00,098 --> 00:27:01,859
I'm not manipulating them.

629
00:27:01,859 --> 00:27:04,160
I'm directing.

630
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:04,780
I'm asking.

631
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:07,562
I'm like, hey, shift into this mode.

632
00:27:07,562 --> 00:27:10,323
Shift into this perspective.

633
00:27:13,005 --> 00:27:16,208
And that way, when we end up surprising the player,

634
00:27:16,208 --> 00:27:18,090
shoving them down by the boar,

635
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:20,472
they get to experience that emotion in a much more valid way

636
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,914
than if it was just rope.

637
00:27:22,914 --> 00:27:26,617
And as you're still reeling from all of that adrenaline,

638
00:27:26,617 --> 00:27:28,438
we take you through that last beat,

639
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:30,600
that last point of separation.

640
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,101
But yeah, again, space.

641
00:27:32,101 --> 00:27:36,385
It lets the player perform without a script.

642
00:27:36,385 --> 00:27:37,606
Plenty of resources on this one.

643
00:27:37,606 --> 00:27:39,227
I'd really recommend framed ink.

644
00:27:39,785 --> 00:27:42,187
an architectural approach to level design,

645
00:27:42,187 --> 00:27:44,269
architecture, form, space, and order, and the visual story.

646
00:27:44,269 --> 00:27:46,271
So, neat.

647
00:27:46,271 --> 00:27:53,038
But, what about, you know, things we haven't covered,

648
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:53,958
like timing?

649
00:27:53,958 --> 00:27:56,841
Let's talk about pacing and process.

650
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,543
So we have all of this stuff.

651
00:27:58,543 --> 00:28:01,466
We have the space, the gameplay, the characters,

652
00:28:01,466 --> 00:28:02,727
all of the elements that we need.

653
00:28:02,727 --> 00:28:04,268
How do we actually ensure that

654
00:28:05,476 --> 00:28:07,778
It's digestible that someone would actually sit through

655
00:28:07,778 --> 00:28:10,300
from beginning to end without falling asleep

656
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,340
or turning the game off.

657
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,742
How do we find the right rhythm?

658
00:28:13,742 --> 00:28:17,345
Honestly, we kind of cheated in this case.

659
00:28:17,345 --> 00:28:21,068
I just let the player do it.

660
00:28:21,068 --> 00:28:24,470
I made it more like running and just pacing yourself

661
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:28,593
than like trying to accomplish some kind of graph match.

662
00:28:28,593 --> 00:28:32,676
In fact, I could do an entire talk on pacing design.

663
00:28:32,676 --> 00:28:33,237
And I did.

664
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:36,311
It was yesterday though, sorry.

665
00:28:36,311 --> 00:28:38,792
So this is just gonna be the short version.

666
00:28:38,792 --> 00:28:40,993
The main things we need to know are

667
00:28:40,993 --> 00:28:43,735
when we were building this level,

668
00:28:43,735 --> 00:28:46,917
we wanted to reward people who wanted to linger,

669
00:28:46,917 --> 00:28:48,057
enable people who wanted to rush,

670
00:28:48,057 --> 00:28:50,058
give the player clear options,

671
00:28:50,058 --> 00:28:56,322
and eventually surprise them with a follow through.

672
00:28:56,322 --> 00:28:57,623
These weird little moments

673
00:28:57,623 --> 00:28:59,163
like being able to put a hat on Joel,

674
00:28:59,163 --> 00:29:01,305
having Joel buy into these stupid ideas

675
00:29:01,305 --> 00:29:02,305
that Ellie's been throwing out.

676
00:29:02,825 --> 00:29:04,025
But yeah, really recommend it.

677
00:29:04,025 --> 00:29:05,526
It's gonna be on the vault.

678
00:29:05,526 --> 00:29:07,307
I wish I could cover it more in depth,

679
00:29:07,307 --> 00:29:10,770
but we need to move on specifically

680
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:14,712
to the actual act of getting all of this done.

681
00:29:14,712 --> 00:29:17,974
How did we keep looking at this?

682
00:29:17,974 --> 00:29:21,116
How did we go from concept to completion?

683
00:29:21,116 --> 00:29:23,357
We really tried to make it a living process.

684
00:29:23,357 --> 00:29:26,599
Remember, talked a lot about how iteration drives story.

685
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:28,921
So we've talked about the player's experience.

686
00:29:28,921 --> 00:29:30,362
We've talked about how,

687
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:33,111
we've involved and put them at the center

688
00:29:33,111 --> 00:29:34,872
of this aesthetic universe that we have.

689
00:29:34,872 --> 00:29:36,574
But what about us?

690
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:42,058
Simple truth is, you move forward,

691
00:29:42,058 --> 00:29:44,960
you expect to get it wrong, you reflect,

692
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,961
and keep trying anyway.

693
00:29:46,961 --> 00:29:51,685
Most of your ideas will end up in here.

694
00:29:51,685 --> 00:29:53,406
Just get used to it, bask in the warmth.

695
00:29:53,406 --> 00:29:56,628
It's never not gonna be painful, trust me.

696
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,350
The amount of iterations I had to do on this

697
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,911
and most of the other levels was,

698
00:30:01,087 --> 00:30:05,029
Intensive, but also, I wasn't surprised by it.

699
00:30:05,029 --> 00:30:06,729
We just kept using all of these lenses,

700
00:30:06,729 --> 00:30:09,010
all of these perspectives to try and make it better

701
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:10,691
a little bit every single time.

702
00:30:10,691 --> 00:30:15,414
That's cool, but like, the other honest question

703
00:30:15,414 --> 00:30:18,375
we need to ask ourselves is,

704
00:30:18,375 --> 00:30:21,497
how do you deal with that struggle?

705
00:30:21,497 --> 00:30:22,637
How do you keep getting back up?

706
00:30:22,637 --> 00:30:24,478
You know, I'm not just gonna sit here and say like,

707
00:30:24,478 --> 00:30:27,499
oh, get good, get harder, get less sensitive

708
00:30:27,499 --> 00:30:29,380
to throwing away work, which is just one

709
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,541
of the hardest things a creative can do.

710
00:30:31,492 --> 00:30:33,553
In the process of making this level though,

711
00:30:33,553 --> 00:30:35,854
I feel like I found a pretty reasonable answer,

712
00:30:35,854 --> 00:30:39,095
which is keep looking for inspiration.

713
00:30:39,095 --> 00:30:44,956
And specifically, I wanna talk about Naoko Yamada.

714
00:30:44,956 --> 00:30:49,058
This person is my favorite film director,

715
00:30:49,058 --> 00:30:51,158
and I'm gonna spend about two minutes

716
00:30:51,158 --> 00:30:52,719
just completely derailing this entire talk

717
00:30:52,719 --> 00:30:54,639
because it's mine and you need to know about her.

718
00:30:54,639 --> 00:30:59,441
So about halfway through making this level,

719
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:00,201
we were just.

720
00:31:01,388 --> 00:31:03,389
kind of lost, like we knew what we wanted to do,

721
00:31:03,389 --> 00:31:05,991
I didn't know how we were actually gonna do it.

722
00:31:05,991 --> 00:31:10,613
And then I found this movie called Liz and the Bluebird.

723
00:31:10,613 --> 00:31:13,594
She is like made by this lady right here, by this studio.

724
00:31:13,594 --> 00:31:16,336
She is of the same caliber as Miyazaki to me,

725
00:31:16,336 --> 00:31:17,556
quite frankly.

726
00:31:17,556 --> 00:31:19,437
And I just wanna do some quick points

727
00:31:19,437 --> 00:31:20,698
on why I think that is.

728
00:31:20,698 --> 00:31:23,799
So let's jump into that.

729
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:27,141
First, she is a master of character and body language.

730
00:31:27,141 --> 00:31:28,442
This is the biggest takeaway.

731
00:31:28,442 --> 00:31:29,662
If you watch her movies for anything,

732
00:31:29,662 --> 00:31:30,863
this is the reason.

733
00:31:31,354 --> 00:31:34,715
She is able to imbue her characters with a sense of life

734
00:31:34,715 --> 00:31:38,237
and cognition and rhythm that is spellbinding.

735
00:31:38,237 --> 00:31:40,658
And like, I don't even have to make a comment here.

736
00:31:40,658 --> 00:31:42,178
Just look at it.

737
00:31:42,178 --> 00:31:46,060
Like every single character has their internal lives

738
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,161
just on full display.

739
00:31:48,161 --> 00:31:51,302
She finds strange little quirks and moments

740
00:31:51,302 --> 00:31:52,623
to just pull out of characters.

741
00:31:52,623 --> 00:31:54,103
In fact, she's so good at this,

742
00:31:54,103 --> 00:31:57,124
she's actually notorious for just shooting people

743
00:31:57,124 --> 00:31:58,665
from the knees down in a scene

744
00:31:58,665 --> 00:32:01,086
and fully being able to articulate their emotions from that.

745
00:32:01,835 --> 00:32:04,016
I mean, look, she's doing it right now.

746
00:32:04,016 --> 00:32:06,718
She makes the mundane spectacular.

747
00:32:06,718 --> 00:32:08,860
She's just able to take any normal world.

748
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,721
She doesn't use fantastical elements like Miyazaki.

749
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:15,284
Every single one of her films are real world,

750
00:32:15,284 --> 00:32:17,565
real problems, simple people,

751
00:32:17,565 --> 00:32:21,308
struggling with emotions and love,

752
00:32:21,308 --> 00:32:23,530
and then she'll take all of that and emotionally destroy you.

753
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:27,632
Like, I have trouble staying hydrated in most of her films.

754
00:32:27,632 --> 00:32:29,674
Like, I just sob.

755
00:32:29,674 --> 00:32:30,975
Like, it's great.

756
00:32:31,389 --> 00:32:33,631
I mean, look at this shit.

757
00:32:33,631 --> 00:32:36,773
You're going to feel this way.

758
00:32:36,773 --> 00:32:38,834
It's bleak and it's beautiful.

759
00:32:38,834 --> 00:32:42,817
I think all of this happens because as a leader, I also find her as an inspiration.

760
00:32:42,817 --> 00:32:45,659
She brings out the best in other great artists.

761
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:47,941
This guy right here is called Kensuke Ushio.

762
00:32:47,941 --> 00:32:53,585
He is a phenomenal composer, but most strikingly, his music sounds totally different when he's

763
00:32:53,585 --> 00:32:54,466
working on her projects.

764
00:32:54,466 --> 00:32:55,266
He's normally doing like...

765
00:32:55,705 --> 00:32:59,787
dark, grungy, insane, almost metal-like music for things like Devilman Crybaby.

766
00:32:59,787 --> 00:33:04,469
For Liz and the Bluebird, he literally scattered paint onto the bars and then composed off of that

767
00:33:04,469 --> 00:33:11,453
after seeing an animation technique she was using. She has a masterful studio that really backs her

768
00:33:11,453 --> 00:33:17,516
up. And then, in the most selfish part of this talk, the other reason I like her is her favorite

769
00:33:17,516 --> 00:33:20,137
director is my other favorite director. This guy...

770
00:33:23,932 --> 00:33:27,573
who looks like a Dark Souls boss,

771
00:33:27,573 --> 00:33:28,633
is Jodorowsky.

772
00:33:28,633 --> 00:33:30,634
He's this weird Argentinian

773
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:31,795
where you don't have time to get into him.

774
00:33:31,795 --> 00:33:34,316
The main thing is, his stuff's wild.

775
00:33:34,316 --> 00:33:36,236
It's surreal, it's poetic,

776
00:33:36,236 --> 00:33:37,337
and I think you'd regret missing it.

777
00:33:37,337 --> 00:33:39,818
So two minutes are up.

778
00:33:39,818 --> 00:33:41,318
Just wanted to do that aside.

779
00:33:41,318 --> 00:33:43,839
I could do an entire hour on this director and her work,

780
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:47,261
and I might, but if I could just sum it up in one word,

781
00:33:47,261 --> 00:33:49,681
it would be grace.

782
00:33:49,681 --> 00:33:50,982
Her work is graceful.

783
00:33:52,314 --> 00:33:54,436
And if you like anything I've done,

784
00:33:54,436 --> 00:33:57,758
this is the template for a lot of what I pursue

785
00:33:57,758 --> 00:33:58,778
as a creative.

786
00:33:58,778 --> 00:34:02,401
This is the template that I'm like striving for now

787
00:34:02,401 --> 00:34:03,342
after seeing this.

788
00:34:03,342 --> 00:34:06,344
Like it changed the trajectory of my creative ambitions.

789
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:07,464
It was just that important to me.

790
00:34:07,464 --> 00:34:10,106
But enough about that.

791
00:34:10,106 --> 00:34:14,049
Let's get into the next stage, which is production.

792
00:34:14,049 --> 00:34:16,190
The how do.

793
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:21,914
How do we actually take all of these compositional things

794
00:34:22,342 --> 00:34:24,303
and make it happen.

795
00:34:24,303 --> 00:34:26,163
So let's take a quick look.

796
00:34:26,163 --> 00:34:29,544
So we had teams and timelines.

797
00:34:29,544 --> 00:34:33,586
My role on this project officially was level design.

798
00:34:33,586 --> 00:34:35,546
Basically, I was the first designer on the ground,

799
00:34:35,546 --> 00:34:37,507
I created the layouts, some of the prototypes,

800
00:34:37,507 --> 00:34:39,327
and then coordinated the teams at each stage.

801
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:41,268
I was basically the person who, quote unquote,

802
00:34:41,268 --> 00:34:42,268
owned the level.

803
00:34:42,268 --> 00:34:43,589
Doesn't mean I did everything

804
00:34:43,589 --> 00:34:45,169
or was the main person in charge.

805
00:34:45,169 --> 00:34:46,329
I was just the person responsible

806
00:34:46,329 --> 00:34:47,970
for making sure everybody was talking to each other.

807
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:50,831
So at the start, it was just me.

808
00:34:51,462 --> 00:34:53,043
The way we just generally do it is like,

809
00:34:53,043 --> 00:34:54,925
we start with a level designer and a lead

810
00:34:54,925 --> 00:34:56,906
kind of working together to incubate it.

811
00:34:56,906 --> 00:34:58,227
We move it up to a four person strike team

812
00:34:58,227 --> 00:35:01,029
until it's kind of cooking a little bit better.

813
00:35:01,029 --> 00:35:02,670
And then as we move into alpha and play testing,

814
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:04,872
we slowly ramp up to more and more people,

815
00:35:04,872 --> 00:35:07,314
more and more people, until at full production,

816
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:08,194
it's all hands on deck.

817
00:35:08,194 --> 00:35:09,796
The maximum amount of people working on it,

818
00:35:09,796 --> 00:35:10,856
all departments are involved,

819
00:35:10,856 --> 00:35:13,598
everything is just firing in all cylinders.

820
00:35:13,598 --> 00:35:17,521
Also, I didn't work on this level beginning to end

821
00:35:17,521 --> 00:35:18,382
in one big chunk.

822
00:35:19,869 --> 00:35:22,110
Each of us had about three to five levels

823
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:24,450
that we accomplished and wove together

824
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:25,531
for over about two years.

825
00:35:25,531 --> 00:35:28,052
So I wanna talk about this process a little bit.

826
00:35:28,052 --> 00:35:30,612
The first step to me,

827
00:35:30,612 --> 00:35:32,993
how I'd like to describe Naughty Dog's goals

828
00:35:32,993 --> 00:35:35,434
is to create a playable storyboard.

829
00:35:35,434 --> 00:35:38,235
Step one of this is actually breaking the story.

830
00:35:38,235 --> 00:35:42,576
We sit down with the writers, we read the pitch,

831
00:35:42,576 --> 00:35:44,836
we grab the lead into a meeting and we just talk about it.

832
00:35:44,836 --> 00:35:47,177
We figure out in a brainstorm,

833
00:35:48,533 --> 00:35:49,714
what we're trying to accomplish,

834
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:51,055
what are interesting things that we can do,

835
00:35:51,055 --> 00:35:53,877
using all of these things that we've talked about before.

836
00:35:53,877 --> 00:35:56,960
We literally went to a seminar hosted by Robert McKee

837
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,401
early when I started there,

838
00:35:58,401 --> 00:36:00,442
just to have a shared language

839
00:36:00,442 --> 00:36:02,324
that we could start chewing on this,

840
00:36:02,324 --> 00:36:03,945
start breaking this down into manageable parts

841
00:36:03,945 --> 00:36:05,746
and make it happen.

842
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:08,929
After that meeting,

843
00:36:08,929 --> 00:36:12,131
level designer would break off with the lead

844
00:36:12,131 --> 00:36:14,613
and just plan a first pass.

845
00:36:14,613 --> 00:36:16,814
We would try to get all of this done

846
00:36:16,814 --> 00:36:18,035
in like less than two days.

847
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:23,387
It's a very, very concise but focused start to all of this.

848
00:36:23,387 --> 00:36:25,889
The next step though is what I like to call

849
00:36:25,889 --> 00:36:27,470
3D first design.

850
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:29,531
We would just jump straight into Maya.

851
00:36:29,531 --> 00:36:32,213
No top-down maps, maybe just a rough outline,

852
00:36:32,213 --> 00:36:36,375
maybe a few scribbles, nothing substantial

853
00:36:36,375 --> 00:36:38,176
beyond actually getting a mesh done

854
00:36:38,176 --> 00:36:39,037
that I can walk around in.

855
00:36:39,037 --> 00:36:40,938
We get the block mesh in engine

856
00:36:40,938 --> 00:36:42,959
and we try to actually move the character

857
00:36:42,959 --> 00:36:44,380
in the camera around to see if it starts working.

858
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:47,371
The reason I think this is one of the best ways to do it

859
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,831
is it's the fastest way to test an idea.

860
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:51,692
You can see if this even makes sense,

861
00:36:51,692 --> 00:36:53,952
if this feels too big or too small,

862
00:36:53,952 --> 00:36:55,253
if the camera doesn't make any sense,

863
00:36:55,253 --> 00:36:57,113
if you can even accomplish something like

864
00:36:57,113 --> 00:36:59,294
revealing a dinosaur to somebody

865
00:36:59,294 --> 00:37:01,234
by wandering through a forest.

866
00:37:01,234 --> 00:37:02,574
You can say all of those things,

867
00:37:02,574 --> 00:37:04,815
but it doesn't matter unless you can prove

868
00:37:04,815 --> 00:37:06,675
that it actually works in engine.

869
00:37:06,675 --> 00:37:09,036
And it's also important to do it so fast

870
00:37:09,036 --> 00:37:11,316
because it lets you assume that things will be thrown away.

871
00:37:11,316 --> 00:37:14,197
Going back to that living process and that iteration.

872
00:37:15,035 --> 00:37:19,196
you were intentionally making this to die.

873
00:37:19,196 --> 00:37:21,416
Like, don't care about it,

874
00:37:21,416 --> 00:37:24,497
don't feel as little pain to shove it out and try again.

875
00:37:24,497 --> 00:37:27,398
But yeah, what also do we mean

876
00:37:27,398 --> 00:37:29,119
when we're talking about storyboards?

877
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,219
What do we mean playable storyboard?

878
00:37:31,219 --> 00:37:35,440
So I think for extra context on what I was just saying,

879
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,761
a lot of storyboards are like this.

880
00:37:36,761 --> 00:37:39,301
Like this is from Knives Out.

881
00:37:39,301 --> 00:37:42,762
The image on the right is their initial concept

882
00:37:42,762 --> 00:37:43,903
for this shot.

883
00:37:45,494 --> 00:37:46,775
Just soak it in.

884
00:37:46,775 --> 00:37:48,555
You don't need to be a master illustrator

885
00:37:48,555 --> 00:37:51,316
to convey your ideas.

886
00:37:51,316 --> 00:37:53,277
And now I'm gonna show you what we dealt with

887
00:37:53,277 --> 00:37:55,298
in the early stages of development.

888
00:37:55,298 --> 00:37:58,339
This was the first version of the dinosaur.

889
00:37:58,339 --> 00:38:02,501
This is how we tested it.

890
00:38:02,501 --> 00:38:05,122
This is how we saw if like, hey, can this even work?

891
00:38:05,122 --> 00:38:08,183
And once we realized it did work,

892
00:38:08,183 --> 00:38:10,344
we took it to the final version.

893
00:38:10,344 --> 00:38:13,145
Unfortunately, due to a hiccup with the WiFi,

894
00:38:13,145 --> 00:38:14,246
I was gonna show some.

895
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,560
videos of early playtest levels,

896
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,861
but they're all on my website, ehilldesign.com.

897
00:38:19,861 --> 00:38:22,742
Basically just showing a bit of the block mesh process,

898
00:38:22,742 --> 00:38:25,462
the kinds of things that we do to walk the player through

899
00:38:25,462 --> 00:38:26,283
and have that playable prototype.

900
00:38:26,283 --> 00:38:29,163
But just as another example, looking at this,

901
00:38:29,163 --> 00:38:32,024
look at this mess, look at this scribble.

902
00:38:32,024 --> 00:38:34,965
This is an early storyboard for JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.

903
00:38:34,965 --> 00:38:36,785
The person behind this is like

904
00:38:36,785 --> 00:38:38,906
one of the best draftsmen alive.

905
00:38:38,906 --> 00:38:40,426
This guy's been in the Louvre.

906
00:38:40,426 --> 00:38:43,987
This is what he normally draws like in a finished product,

907
00:38:43,987 --> 00:38:44,427
but again.

908
00:38:45,319 --> 00:38:46,860
He starts with this.

909
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:49,241
Starts with something that can be thrown away

910
00:38:49,241 --> 00:38:50,062
just to see if the idea works.

911
00:38:50,062 --> 00:38:55,085
So yeah, once we have this thing,

912
00:38:55,085 --> 00:38:56,726
once we have this playable storyboard,

913
00:38:56,726 --> 00:38:58,667
we walk through the block mesh with the leads.

914
00:38:58,667 --> 00:39:03,690
We actually sit down face to face and just talk through it.

915
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:05,611
We fill in the gaps of animation and art

916
00:39:05,611 --> 00:39:07,973
and dialogue with our performance.

917
00:39:07,973 --> 00:39:09,754
Like I mentioned, we were all ex-theater kids.

918
00:39:09,754 --> 00:39:10,234
Or not all, but.

919
00:39:12,106 --> 00:39:13,787
We all acted like we were ex-theater kids.

920
00:39:13,787 --> 00:39:16,348
We just lived in the scene with each other.

921
00:39:16,348 --> 00:39:17,408
We tried to figure it out.

922
00:39:17,408 --> 00:39:19,789
We would just wildly gesture and say,

923
00:39:19,789 --> 00:39:23,111
like, oh, it'll look like this, it'll be great, you know?

924
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:25,252
And it led to a lot of great moments.

925
00:39:25,252 --> 00:39:28,233
The first time I showed this off to the leads,

926
00:39:28,233 --> 00:39:29,994
one of them, right out of their mouth,

927
00:39:29,994 --> 00:39:31,154
can I climb the dinosaur?

928
00:39:31,154 --> 00:39:35,836
Like, the grin on their face was phenomenal.

929
00:39:35,836 --> 00:39:38,317
When we said, yeah, sure, we could totally do that.

930
00:39:38,317 --> 00:39:38,778
And then we did.

931
00:39:38,778 --> 00:39:40,698
Same thing with the hats.

932
00:39:40,698 --> 00:39:41,939
It was just a dumb joke I made.

933
00:39:42,869 --> 00:39:46,850
just totally off the cuff and it wound up being a feature

934
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:48,851
that a lot of people really like.

935
00:39:48,851 --> 00:39:52,952
So yeah, we would talk about what sucked and what worked.

936
00:39:52,952 --> 00:39:54,932
We would use all of that compositional stuff

937
00:39:54,932 --> 00:39:56,372
we covered in the first part of this talk

938
00:39:56,372 --> 00:39:59,373
to analyze what was good to move forward with

939
00:39:59,373 --> 00:40:01,494
and what we needed to cut or redo.

940
00:40:01,494 --> 00:40:05,455
And we just literally throw it all out again and redo.

941
00:40:05,455 --> 00:40:08,315
It's the power of iteration.

942
00:40:08,315 --> 00:40:09,316
You rework it until it clicks.

943
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,901
Normally we would spend about several weeks iterating,

944
00:40:12,901 --> 00:40:15,162
like four to 12, depending on the complexity.

945
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:18,063
That's total, mind you, not per iteration.

946
00:40:18,063 --> 00:40:20,824
Four to 12 weeks of figuring out this block mesh,

947
00:40:20,824 --> 00:40:22,705
this playable storyboard.

948
00:40:22,705 --> 00:40:26,386
Again, like including starting from scratch.

949
00:40:26,386 --> 00:40:28,567
Like we tried to keep this as limited

950
00:40:28,567 --> 00:40:30,087
and light as possible.

951
00:40:30,087 --> 00:40:31,588
This is the part where the level designer

952
00:40:31,588 --> 00:40:33,589
was the only person working on it.

953
00:40:33,589 --> 00:40:35,049
But yeah, it lets it grow and breathe

954
00:40:35,049 --> 00:40:35,910
as we get a feel for it.

955
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:37,430
We don't really even know at this point.

956
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,101
how long the final level is going to be.

957
00:40:39,101 --> 00:40:42,764
You could add a third, double it, cut it, shift it around,

958
00:40:42,764 --> 00:40:45,105
try radical different flows and beats of the elements.

959
00:40:45,105 --> 00:40:48,027
Like the dinosaur kind of came in early,

960
00:40:48,027 --> 00:40:51,729
but for example, the space capsule, that whole entire scene,

961
00:40:51,729 --> 00:40:53,891
that wasn't until like the last quarter

962
00:40:53,891 --> 00:40:56,032
of this like ideation process,

963
00:40:56,032 --> 00:40:58,273
before the graffiti was just gonna be right after

964
00:40:58,273 --> 00:41:01,055
the main part of the museum and on the space capsule itself.

965
00:41:01,055 --> 00:41:05,538
But in going through this process,

966
00:41:05,538 --> 00:41:07,279
me and the leads like wanted more.

967
00:41:07,697 --> 00:41:08,818
We figured out what to add,

968
00:41:08,818 --> 00:41:12,961
and then I just went back into Maya and added more.

969
00:41:12,961 --> 00:41:15,303
But yeah, once we have this rough sketch done,

970
00:41:15,303 --> 00:41:16,624
this playable storyboard, that's great,

971
00:41:16,624 --> 00:41:19,847
but that's not enough.

972
00:41:19,847 --> 00:41:24,271
The next stage is getting into alphas and playtesting.

973
00:41:24,271 --> 00:41:25,832
We try to build a playable prototype.

974
00:41:25,832 --> 00:41:27,474
That's where the first stage

975
00:41:27,474 --> 00:41:29,475
is we're taking it to other designers.

976
00:41:29,475 --> 00:41:32,598
We're trying to limit our gesturing, our manic energy,

977
00:41:33,307 --> 00:41:35,268
convey the story and just let it speak more

978
00:41:35,268 --> 00:41:36,969
and more for itself.

979
00:41:36,969 --> 00:41:39,630
That's when we also start adding in more developers.

980
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:41,832
It's like I said, the four to six person strike team

981
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:45,074
that supports the level designer to actually finish

982
00:41:45,074 --> 00:41:47,355
and develop features.

983
00:41:47,355 --> 00:41:49,056
And then work towards that first playable.

984
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:54,680
First playable means the first time you can just shut up

985
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,181
and let someone play it on their own.

986
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:59,283
No guides, no role presentation.

987
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:02,565
I hand it to you, I leave the room, does it work or not?

988
00:42:03,941 --> 00:42:05,382
Again, I would have some video for you,

989
00:42:05,382 --> 00:42:08,224
but unfortunately not, all on my website.

990
00:42:08,224 --> 00:42:10,486
And then once we hit that stage,

991
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:13,768
once I can actually hand it to you and leave,

992
00:42:13,768 --> 00:42:17,711
we grab some outside people, hand it to them and leave.

993
00:42:17,711 --> 00:42:21,514
So every few weeks we would have outside people come in,

994
00:42:21,514 --> 00:42:23,076
they'd have really detailed feedback,

995
00:42:23,076 --> 00:42:26,178
and we do this about a cadence of every two to three weeks

996
00:42:26,178 --> 00:42:27,819
as we're shifting through production.

997
00:42:27,819 --> 00:42:30,842
So this would be a studio-wide event.

998
00:42:32,369 --> 00:42:34,851
And trust me, when you start play testing,

999
00:42:34,851 --> 00:42:37,253
thoroughly like this or not,

1000
00:42:37,253 --> 00:42:38,794
you will see how bad your layout really is.

1001
00:42:38,794 --> 00:42:41,816
Everything that was duct taped over

1002
00:42:41,816 --> 00:42:44,217
with good intentions and slick presentations

1003
00:42:44,217 --> 00:42:46,659
just falls away.

1004
00:42:46,659 --> 00:42:48,481
You will watch people get lost,

1005
00:42:48,481 --> 00:42:51,703
not care about your story, complain,

1006
00:42:51,703 --> 00:42:54,285
and worst of all, be right about all of it.

1007
00:42:54,285 --> 00:42:56,006
Just rip it apart.

1008
00:42:59,271 --> 00:43:01,472
Also because of this cycle, this like tempo

1009
00:43:01,472 --> 00:43:02,592
where every two to three weeks,

1010
00:43:02,592 --> 00:43:04,572
we knew we were gonna be bringing in new people.

1011
00:43:04,572 --> 00:43:07,073
We knew that, oh, I fucked up.

1012
00:43:07,073 --> 00:43:09,494
That level sucked.

1013
00:43:09,494 --> 00:43:12,815
What can I do in the next three weeks to make it better?

1014
00:43:12,815 --> 00:43:15,555
What can I do to ensure that I don't break this

1015
00:43:15,555 --> 00:43:18,036
and it's still playable in three weeks too?

1016
00:43:18,036 --> 00:43:23,078
Yeah, so all the changes need to be playable.

1017
00:43:23,078 --> 00:43:24,818
We had so much data to work with though.

1018
00:43:24,818 --> 00:43:26,298
It was massively helpful.

1019
00:43:26,902 --> 00:43:29,644
And another level with it too, it was studio-wide tempo.

1020
00:43:29,644 --> 00:43:31,005
It wasn't just playtesting your level,

1021
00:43:31,005 --> 00:43:32,947
it was playtesting all the levels at once.

1022
00:43:32,947 --> 00:43:34,609
Then we would go back to iteration,

1023
00:43:34,609 --> 00:43:36,871
and then playtest all the levels at once.

1024
00:43:36,871 --> 00:43:40,014
It really helped facilitate just a cohesion.

1025
00:43:40,014 --> 00:43:41,315
Everybody knew what was on the schedule.

1026
00:43:41,315 --> 00:43:42,896
Everybody knew what needed to get done.

1027
00:43:42,896 --> 00:43:44,958
We were able to focus on tighter milestones.

1028
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:49,251
But from there, we would also take all of that data

1029
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:50,132
and try to dial things in.

1030
00:43:50,132 --> 00:43:51,993
That's when the more formal reviews

1031
00:43:51,993 --> 00:43:54,655
with studio leadership would tend to happen.

1032
00:43:54,655 --> 00:43:55,936
We'd refine features and scripting

1033
00:43:55,936 --> 00:43:57,837
and prove out any ideas that we have

1034
00:43:57,837 --> 00:44:00,519
with playtest feedback rather than just wildly gesturing,

1035
00:44:00,519 --> 00:44:02,220
hey guys, I think this is a really good idea.

1036
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:04,841
Instead, we can go like, hey, this part,

1037
00:44:04,841 --> 00:44:07,503
objectively people like it, they keep talking about it.

1038
00:44:07,503 --> 00:44:10,165
Let's improve this or fix this.

1039
00:44:10,165 --> 00:44:11,686
Again, it's just all about trying

1040
00:44:11,686 --> 00:44:13,587
to facilitate effective iteration.

1041
00:44:13,587 --> 00:44:14,107
But even at this stage,

1042
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:19,938
You know, we tried to cut things early,

1043
00:44:19,938 --> 00:44:20,738
throw things out fast,

1044
00:44:20,738 --> 00:44:22,579
but there's still gonna be a lot of rework.

1045
00:44:22,579 --> 00:44:24,740
Cuts, revisions, additions.

1046
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:26,360
We use the entire team for input at this point.

1047
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,641
Starting from scratch is almost limited

1048
00:44:28,641 --> 00:44:31,683
to specific sections, but it's still fairly common.

1049
00:44:31,683 --> 00:44:32,663
We call it back to layout,

1050
00:44:32,663 --> 00:44:34,824
where a chunk of the level might just be kind of

1051
00:44:34,824 --> 00:44:36,845
sawed out and redone.

1052
00:44:36,845 --> 00:44:40,306
Honest example of this was that space section.

1053
00:44:40,306 --> 00:44:43,748
We were pretty confident in the rest of the layout

1054
00:44:43,748 --> 00:44:44,888
and the rest of the area, but.

1055
00:44:45,395 --> 00:44:46,816
There were a few times where we just looked

1056
00:44:46,816 --> 00:44:49,237
at that upper area, that second floor,

1057
00:44:49,237 --> 00:44:52,980
and we had art done for it, we had some features in,

1058
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:55,562
and it just wasn't right.

1059
00:44:55,562 --> 00:44:59,965
And we kind of pulled the trigger on redoing it again.

1060
00:44:59,965 --> 00:45:02,066
And yeah, just going back to that iteration,

1061
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:05,409
that living process, you just keep trying to make it work.

1062
00:45:05,409 --> 00:45:11,233
You keep redoing and redoing and redoing.

1063
00:45:11,233 --> 00:45:13,875
But what happens when it does work?

1064
00:45:15,047 --> 00:45:16,848
Like YouTube just burnt all of this effort,

1065
00:45:16,848 --> 00:45:19,010
like desperately trying to make this thing work.

1066
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:20,231
And now it does.

1067
00:45:20,231 --> 00:45:21,792
And now what?

1068
00:45:21,792 --> 00:45:23,953
That's when you lock the layout.

1069
00:45:23,953 --> 00:45:27,035
The level is moved from prototype to alpha.

1070
00:45:27,035 --> 00:45:29,517
Now the rest of the team can be brought in

1071
00:45:29,517 --> 00:45:31,878
to actually make this thing shippable.

1072
00:45:31,878 --> 00:45:34,680
Which brings us to full production.

1073
00:45:35,885 --> 00:45:37,745
This is the part where everything gets ramped up.

1074
00:45:37,745 --> 00:45:40,066
We bring off, hand off to the other departments.

1075
00:45:40,066 --> 00:45:41,166
This isn't a comprehensive list,

1076
00:45:41,166 --> 00:45:43,407
but you know, an example is like audio, VFX,

1077
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:46,128
mocap, dialogue, character art, AI, foreground,

1078
00:45:46,128 --> 00:45:48,569
technical art, environment art, animation,

1079
00:45:48,569 --> 00:45:50,930
cinematics, QA, and on and on and on and on.

1080
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:52,810
This is when we take it from just,

1081
00:45:52,810 --> 00:45:54,231
oh, the designers are working on this cool thing

1082
00:45:54,231 --> 00:45:56,231
with a small group of people to everyone needs to know

1083
00:45:56,231 --> 00:45:57,692
about every detail all of the time.

1084
00:45:57,692 --> 00:46:00,533
It also really helps collaboration.

1085
00:46:01,234 --> 00:46:04,017
We then start really focusing on feedback and direction,

1086
00:46:04,017 --> 00:46:05,879
more as level designers, more than anything else.

1087
00:46:05,879 --> 00:46:07,741
This is when it goes hands off.

1088
00:46:07,741 --> 00:46:10,143
Like, I should not be in Maya,

1089
00:46:10,143 --> 00:46:11,645
I should not be in editor,

1090
00:46:11,645 --> 00:46:13,427
messing with things other than gameplay scripting.

1091
00:46:13,427 --> 00:46:16,010
So yeah, it's like I shift time

1092
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:16,971
to other levels at this point.

1093
00:46:16,971 --> 00:46:18,993
Like maybe I start the whole process over

1094
00:46:18,993 --> 00:46:21,495
on another section, or start scripting gameplay

1095
00:46:21,495 --> 00:46:22,016
for the scene.

1096
00:46:24,187 --> 00:46:26,288
A big part of this, at least in the Naughty Dog process

1097
00:46:26,288 --> 00:46:27,169
and in making this up for me,

1098
00:46:27,169 --> 00:46:28,650
was coordinating the team as well.

1099
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:31,531
I was the one scheduling meetings, relaying information,

1100
00:46:31,531 --> 00:46:32,692
managing task loads and deadlines,

1101
00:46:32,692 --> 00:46:36,554
and also facilitating the review process.

1102
00:46:36,554 --> 00:46:38,635
I really liked what we did on this project,

1103
00:46:38,635 --> 00:46:41,917
where we would have large recorded meetings,

1104
00:46:41,917 --> 00:46:44,519
where we would just play through the level

1105
00:46:44,519 --> 00:46:45,719
and note down every single thing that was wrong.

1106
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:47,621
And this would be like maybe eight people at some times,

1107
00:46:47,621 --> 00:46:50,502
just pausing, commenting, pausing, commenting.

1108
00:46:50,502 --> 00:46:52,443
So a 20-minute level might be three hours

1109
00:46:52,443 --> 00:46:53,784
of commentary video.

1110
00:46:54,663 --> 00:46:56,444
But we also had this annotation software

1111
00:46:56,444 --> 00:47:00,565
where you could take the recording and just make a note,

1112
00:47:00,565 --> 00:47:02,446
turn that note into a Jira ticket,

1113
00:47:02,446 --> 00:47:03,406
hand it all to the level designer,

1114
00:47:03,406 --> 00:47:05,367
hand off all the Jira tickets to the people

1115
00:47:05,367 --> 00:47:08,568
that need to get it done.

1116
00:47:08,568 --> 00:47:11,949
But yeah, this is mostly focused, specific feedback.

1117
00:47:11,949 --> 00:47:13,970
Very rarely would this turn into a full rework,

1118
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:16,310
a back to layout kick.

1119
00:47:16,310 --> 00:47:18,011
But yeah, how did I do this?

1120
00:47:18,011 --> 00:47:19,091
What kind of fancy tools were there?

1121
00:47:19,091 --> 00:47:20,892
Nothing really important.

1122
00:47:20,892 --> 00:47:23,653
Face-to-face communication, legal pads.

1123
00:47:24,188 --> 00:47:27,331
Skype for business, email, JIRA, no silly proprietary

1124
00:47:27,331 --> 00:47:31,514
scrim board or anything else, just actual paper,

1125
00:47:31,514 --> 00:47:35,116
a few tags, and it kind of looks something like this.

1126
00:47:35,116 --> 00:47:37,538
For clarity, this is not at all for anything Naughty Dog,

1127
00:47:37,538 --> 00:47:39,359
this is just some personal projects that I kind of work with

1128
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:41,121
but no, I would just kind of run around the office

1129
00:47:41,121 --> 00:47:42,101
like it was an Aaron Sorkin movie,

1130
00:47:42,101 --> 00:47:44,623
just talking to each department about every single thing

1131
00:47:44,623 --> 00:47:46,064
on my giant list I'd need done for the day.

1132
00:47:46,064 --> 00:47:48,686
I would break it down into sections with tabs,

1133
00:47:48,686 --> 00:47:52,529
and yeah, it was facilitating iteration.

1134
00:47:54,559 --> 00:48:00,441
And then the hard part comes, which is lock and polish.

1135
00:48:00,441 --> 00:48:03,642
So before when we said we handed things off,

1136
00:48:03,642 --> 00:48:05,422
it was kind of a lie, there were still reworks,

1137
00:48:05,422 --> 00:48:09,683
but this was the hard point where we would shift into,

1138
00:48:09,683 --> 00:48:12,484
we have deadlines, we're getting this done,

1139
00:48:12,484 --> 00:48:15,605
no major changes, push it from this janky prototype mess

1140
00:48:15,605 --> 00:48:19,946
to this thing that is naughty dog quality.

1141
00:48:19,946 --> 00:48:23,427
So in this polish stage, everything matters.

1142
00:48:24,044 --> 00:48:25,665
The review and the playtesting cycle I mentioned before

1143
00:48:25,665 --> 00:48:28,326
is continuing through this entire process, this entire span.

1144
00:48:28,326 --> 00:48:31,728
And the notes are picking up.

1145
00:48:31,728 --> 00:48:33,229
They're getting more and more.

1146
00:48:33,229 --> 00:48:34,449
It turns into a flood.

1147
00:48:34,449 --> 00:48:37,271
Every single department has tiny tweaks and everything,

1148
00:48:37,271 --> 00:48:40,732
but through all of this, it starts to finally take shape

1149
00:48:40,732 --> 00:48:41,713
into something that's gonna ship.

1150
00:48:41,713 --> 00:48:42,974
And yeah, a lot of this time,

1151
00:48:42,974 --> 00:48:46,175
even though there's no layouts to be done,

1152
00:48:46,175 --> 00:48:48,816
us in the level design department are running around,

1153
00:48:48,816 --> 00:48:50,857
doing additional scripting, fixing things.

1154
00:48:51,989 --> 00:48:53,670
We're just responsible to get things done.

1155
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:56,252
I was basically a messenger boy on some days,

1156
00:48:56,252 --> 00:48:57,933
and it was hectic as heck,

1157
00:48:57,933 --> 00:49:00,974
because that's the real takeaway on this part of production.

1158
00:49:00,974 --> 00:49:01,895
The team does it.

1159
00:49:01,895 --> 00:49:04,997
All of these other developers that I worked with

1160
00:49:04,997 --> 00:49:06,658
are some of the most talented people

1161
00:49:06,658 --> 00:49:08,879
I probably will ever have the privilege to work with,

1162
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:10,740
and they're just great.

1163
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:13,782
They were on top of everything to the point that,

1164
00:49:13,782 --> 00:49:16,924
yeah, I was relegated to just running around,

1165
00:49:16,924 --> 00:49:17,985
conveying information in notes,

1166
00:49:17,985 --> 00:49:20,907
because, yeah, this.

1167
00:49:21,419 --> 00:49:24,141
that type of work isn't focused on somebody like me

1168
00:49:24,141 --> 00:49:25,321
or the leads.

1169
00:49:25,321 --> 00:49:30,464
It does take an entire massive organization to deliver.

1170
00:49:30,464 --> 00:49:33,986
And the result is honestly still just one of the things

1171
00:49:33,986 --> 00:49:35,687
I'm most proud to have helped on.

1172
00:49:35,687 --> 00:49:38,829
Like I, yeah, this was a joy to work on

1173
00:49:38,829 --> 00:49:43,792
and thanks for letting me do this talk.

1174
00:49:43,792 --> 00:49:44,752
So yeah, that's it.

1175
00:49:44,752 --> 00:49:46,513
We've covered composition and production,

1176
00:49:46,513 --> 00:49:48,675
hopefully giving you a bit of an insight into.

1177
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,900
what it takes to make a Naughty Dog level,

1178
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:53,261
specifically a weird one like this.

1179
00:49:53,261 --> 00:49:55,821
But yeah, final housekeeping,

1180
00:49:55,821 --> 00:49:57,061
let's cover some of the takeaways.

1181
00:49:57,061 --> 00:49:59,742
You wanna find a useful framework.

1182
00:49:59,742 --> 00:50:00,762
For us, it was story.

1183
00:50:00,762 --> 00:50:01,863
For you, it can be something else,

1184
00:50:01,863 --> 00:50:05,823
competitive integrity, counterplay, whatever it is,

1185
00:50:05,823 --> 00:50:07,264
you use them to guide iteration.

1186
00:50:07,264 --> 00:50:09,904
Start it rough as fast as you can, you fail,

1187
00:50:09,904 --> 00:50:15,086
you pick yourself up, often by finding some inspiration,

1188
00:50:15,086 --> 00:50:17,946
you iterate more, fail more,

1189
00:50:17,946 --> 00:50:19,247
try not to stop until it's great.

1190
00:50:20,195 --> 00:50:21,035
and you rely on your team.

1191
00:50:21,035 --> 00:50:24,236
That's it.

1192
00:50:24,236 --> 00:50:27,897
Hope you guys can follow me.

1193
00:50:27,897 --> 00:50:29,057
This is my Twitter.

1194
00:50:29,057 --> 00:50:32,478
I'm gonna be working on some secret podcast stuff

1195
00:50:32,478 --> 00:50:33,419
that'll hopefully come out soon.

1196
00:50:33,419 --> 00:50:35,679
And then the main thing is,

1197
00:50:35,679 --> 00:50:36,880
I'll be contributing to Outer Worlds 2.

1198
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,641
And here's a list of resources.

1199
00:50:39,641 --> 00:50:40,941
Also go watch Liz and the Bluebird,

1200
00:50:40,941 --> 00:50:42,662
and A Silent Voice, and The Hickey Story.

1201
00:50:42,662 --> 00:50:44,502
I'm not kidding, they're really, really good.

1202
00:50:44,502 --> 00:50:46,383
And we have time for questions.

1203
00:51:01,747 --> 00:51:03,269
Hi, great talk.

1204
00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:06,133
Question about the playtesting every two, three weeks

1205
00:51:06,133 --> 00:51:10,318
that you mentioned, especially early on in the process.

1206
00:51:10,318 --> 00:51:11,880
What does that look like in terms of the questions

1207
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:13,342
that you're asking the playtesters?

1208
00:51:13,342 --> 00:51:15,344
Is it very directed to a specific thing

1209
00:51:15,344 --> 00:51:17,487
that you're trying to accomplish?

1210
00:51:17,487 --> 00:51:18,168
Do you start out general?

1211
00:51:18,548 --> 00:51:19,029
How does that work?

1212
00:51:19,029 --> 00:51:20,490
I can't get too, too specific

1213
00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:22,572
because Sony really has been refining

1214
00:51:22,572 --> 00:51:24,473
their process constantly.

1215
00:51:24,473 --> 00:51:27,696
But in general, it's a lot of data,

1216
00:51:27,696 --> 00:51:32,039
big questionnaires, group feedbacks, focus tests.

1217
00:51:32,039 --> 00:51:33,320
So yeah, just literally anything

1218
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:34,541
that we thought would help, we would throw at it.

1219
00:51:34,541 --> 00:51:37,043
There wasn't like a framework that we really worked from.

1220
00:51:37,043 --> 00:51:38,764
We're just like, what would we like to know

1221
00:51:38,764 --> 00:51:40,826
and what would they like to tell us?

1222
00:51:43,209 --> 00:51:44,070
Hi, thanks for the talk.

1223
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:48,273
I was kind of on the same page as him,

1224
00:51:48,273 --> 00:51:50,755
asking about feedback from outside players.

1225
00:51:50,755 --> 00:51:51,856
How do you kind of handle that?

1226
00:51:51,856 --> 00:51:54,958
And how do you know what's good feedback

1227
00:51:54,958 --> 00:51:56,259
versus bad feedback?

1228
00:51:56,259 --> 00:51:58,801
I mean, you're the level designer, you know best.

1229
00:51:58,801 --> 00:52:00,022
How do you know what to listen to?

1230
00:52:00,022 --> 00:52:01,583
No, that's a really great question.

1231
00:52:01,583 --> 00:52:03,385
So in case it wasn't picked up,

1232
00:52:03,385 --> 00:52:04,766
how do you know it's good feedback?

1233
00:52:04,766 --> 00:52:05,806
How do you know it's bad feedback?

1234
00:52:05,806 --> 00:52:07,167
How do you turn them into notes?

1235
00:52:07,167 --> 00:52:09,709
A good rule of thumb I've always liked

1236
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:11,631
is that the player is.

1237
00:52:12,477 --> 00:52:15,018
usually right that something is wrong,

1238
00:52:15,018 --> 00:52:16,639
but usually wrong about what specifically

1239
00:52:16,639 --> 00:52:17,639
is causing the problem.

1240
00:52:17,639 --> 00:52:22,042
The classic example was there was a first person shooter

1241
00:52:22,042 --> 00:52:24,683
where the two sides had identically,

1242
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:26,004
statistically damaging guns.

1243
00:52:26,004 --> 00:52:27,845
Same fire rate, everything else like that.

1244
00:52:27,845 --> 00:52:30,927
But the sound effects on one

1245
00:52:30,927 --> 00:52:33,688
sounded more aggressive and more intense than the other.

1246
00:52:33,688 --> 00:52:35,469
And as a result, the players kept giving feedback,

1247
00:52:35,469 --> 00:52:37,190
like oh, this gun's more powerful than this one,

1248
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:38,431
this gun's more powerful than this one,

1249
00:52:38,431 --> 00:52:39,972
you need to nerf this.

1250
00:52:39,972 --> 00:52:42,113
You're able to analyze that it's statistically identical.

1251
00:52:43,261 --> 00:52:45,042
The only difference was actually the sound effect.

1252
00:52:45,042 --> 00:52:48,083
They boosted the gain on it, the note went away.

1253
00:52:48,083 --> 00:52:50,023
Again, players are telling you something's wrong

1254
00:52:50,023 --> 00:52:51,304
because there's usually something wrong.

1255
00:52:51,304 --> 00:52:53,805
But they will always, the other thing to understand

1256
00:52:53,805 --> 00:52:56,726
is they'll always reach to the most obvious answer,

1257
00:52:56,726 --> 00:52:58,066
the most proximate answer,

1258
00:52:58,066 --> 00:52:59,587
the thing that's the most in their perception

1259
00:52:59,587 --> 00:53:01,527
because they feel it, they see it,

1260
00:53:01,527 --> 00:53:02,948
they give you the feedback, but yeah.

1261
00:53:05,595 --> 00:53:07,356
One more playtesting question.

1262
00:53:07,356 --> 00:53:10,298
How much do you have the same group of humans come in

1263
00:53:10,298 --> 00:53:12,740
to see if your new iteration works differently

1264
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:14,481
versus try to vary them to make sure

1265
00:53:14,481 --> 00:53:17,723
that you're not just designing for that group of people?

1266
00:53:17,723 --> 00:53:20,645
Oh, we would try to get fresh feedback as much as possible.

1267
00:53:20,645 --> 00:53:23,047
Very rarely, I've forgotten if we ever brought

1268
00:53:23,047 --> 00:53:25,608
entire groups back or entire individuals back,

1269
00:53:25,608 --> 00:53:27,129
but in general with outside playtesting,

1270
00:53:27,129 --> 00:53:30,212
the idea is fresh first player experience.

1271
00:53:30,212 --> 00:53:31,112
And then that kind of,

1272
00:53:31,387 --> 00:53:34,029
Longitudinal iteration would just be mostly design team,

1273
00:53:34,029 --> 00:53:36,712
the people who are also the other developers.

1274
00:53:36,712 --> 00:53:39,834
The people who are making the game would kind of provide

1275
00:53:39,834 --> 00:53:41,896
that like, oh, where were we six months ago

1276
00:53:41,896 --> 00:53:43,637
and where are we now type analysis.

1277
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:45,459
Thank you.

1278
00:53:45,459 --> 00:53:47,000
Quick question about the, I guess,

1279
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,302
the proportion of time that you spent on the blockouts

1280
00:53:49,302 --> 00:53:50,863
versus the polish stage.

1281
00:53:50,863 --> 00:53:51,784
What was that like?

1282
00:53:52,579 --> 00:53:53,760
It was pretty variable.

1283
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,340
I can't give you a hard time on it

1284
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:57,941
because it was all just very fluid, very focused,

1285
00:53:57,941 --> 00:53:59,782
and the directors were the ones

1286
00:53:59,782 --> 00:54:02,363
kind of setting the final deadlines.

1287
00:54:02,363 --> 00:54:06,905
But again, I would wanna say an eighth of the time

1288
00:54:06,905 --> 00:54:09,987
or less was that initial ideation process,

1289
00:54:09,987 --> 00:54:13,188
and then it was probably somewhat close

1290
00:54:13,188 --> 00:54:16,430
to a quarter, a quarter, and then two quarters on polish.

1291
00:54:16,430 --> 00:54:19,331
That final stage of taking it from beta to.

1292
00:54:19,994 --> 00:54:23,495
ship, Naughty Dog is a bit longer than most other studios.

1293
00:54:23,495 --> 00:54:26,657
So I would say, yeah, that's the main balance.

1294
00:54:26,657 --> 00:54:28,078
I can't be like, oh, we spent three months on this,

1295
00:54:28,078 --> 00:54:28,618
three months on that,

1296
00:54:28,618 --> 00:54:31,560
because it was spaced over five levels over two years.

1297
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,381
We had a lot of shifts in production and the like,

1298
00:54:33,381 --> 00:54:36,883
but in general, just providing more time

1299
00:54:36,883 --> 00:54:39,844
for that last step, that last team-focused step,

1300
00:54:39,844 --> 00:54:42,005
I think is another really important thing

1301
00:54:42,005 --> 00:54:45,207
that Naughty Dog does that's not necessarily associated

1302
00:54:45,207 --> 00:54:46,608
with our composition or our level design.

1303
00:54:50,099 --> 00:54:54,362
So as a designer, there's always a moment like you have to iterate until you get it perfect,

1304
00:54:54,362 --> 00:54:58,885
but there's also this expression where an art project is never done, only abandoned.

1305
00:54:58,885 --> 00:55:03,668
I'm wondering when do you know to abandon it? Like especially for that one thing that you

1306
00:55:03,668 --> 00:55:08,352
cut out entirely, because in my mind you could just try to polish a turd as much as you can.

1307
00:55:08,352 --> 00:55:15,577
Yeah, that's where leadership I think is really effective. So kind of by separating that

1308
00:55:15,577 --> 00:55:18,319
decision-making from the person making the ideas.

1309
00:55:18,646 --> 00:55:20,606
and the person deciding this is what gets made

1310
00:55:20,606 --> 00:55:22,607
and that's what doesn't.

1311
00:55:22,607 --> 00:55:24,688
So to me, a good lead is always a good editor.

1312
00:55:24,688 --> 00:55:27,669
They're the people who get to be a step removed

1313
00:55:27,669 --> 00:55:29,749
from the process of making the thing

1314
00:55:29,749 --> 00:55:31,770
and can kind of say, this is done,

1315
00:55:31,770 --> 00:55:33,890
this is good enough, this isn't.

1316
00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:37,011
And yeah, so it's like a structural thing.

1317
00:55:37,011 --> 00:55:40,252
It's not, don't do it alone.

1318
00:55:40,252 --> 00:55:42,073
I guess that's the best way I can do it.

1319
00:55:44,103 --> 00:55:48,687
I was surprised to hear you all used Maya to block out stuff.

1320
00:55:48,687 --> 00:55:55,253
So in my career, I've mostly used brushwork or primitives

1321
00:55:55,253 --> 00:55:57,875
or stuff to block out those rough shapes pretty quickly.

1322
00:55:57,875 --> 00:56:00,717
What did you find the advantages or disadvantages

1323
00:56:00,717 --> 00:56:05,161
were using Maya to block out stuff instead of, say,

1324
00:56:05,161 --> 00:56:07,523
in-editor tools or other things like that?

1325
00:56:08,228 --> 00:56:10,289
Yes, the main reason is just that Naughty Dog

1326
00:56:10,289 --> 00:56:12,811
has its own personalized tech stack.

1327
00:56:12,811 --> 00:56:14,093
There's no, like we're not using Unity or Unreal

1328
00:56:14,093 --> 00:56:14,873
or anything else like that.

1329
00:56:14,873 --> 00:56:16,995
So there was a lot of integration with Maya,

1330
00:56:16,995 --> 00:56:21,839
but overall the main benefit to it in my mind

1331
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:23,860
is just that 3D first design,

1332
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:25,862
being able to focus on bespoke sections.

1333
00:56:25,862 --> 00:56:30,125
So I wouldn't recommend this for all games,

1334
00:56:30,125 --> 00:56:31,847
like working on Outer Worlds 2,

1335
00:56:31,847 --> 00:56:35,430
we're obviously working from more of a kit structure,

1336
00:56:35,430 --> 00:56:35,610
but.

1337
00:56:35,933 --> 00:56:39,116
in a narrative-focused single-player game like The Last of Us,

1338
00:56:39,116 --> 00:56:42,298
being able to just custom make every piece of GO

1339
00:56:42,298 --> 00:56:43,499
in this storyboarding process,

1340
00:56:43,499 --> 00:56:46,521
I think we found that pretty effective.

1341
00:56:46,521 --> 00:56:47,102
We all worked.

1342
00:56:47,634 --> 00:56:48,875
fast enough, we were all capable enough

1343
00:56:48,875 --> 00:56:50,916
at this particular mode that we're able

1344
00:56:50,916 --> 00:56:53,637
to get things standing and done fast enough.

1345
00:56:53,637 --> 00:56:56,558
We also didn't have a lot of complicated physics objects

1346
00:56:56,558 --> 00:56:57,759
or the like in our gameplay loop,

1347
00:56:57,759 --> 00:57:00,320
so we were then able to mostly rely

1348
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:04,342
on just mood, structure, sight lines, and pacing,

1349
00:57:04,342 --> 00:57:06,443
and then just go from Maya to Engine.

1350
00:57:09,228 --> 00:57:14,193
Hey there. So under the production schedule you detailed, other disciplines and teams

1351
00:57:14,193 --> 00:57:18,878
are rolling on pretty far into that design process. And under those conditions, how do

1352
00:57:18,878 --> 00:57:22,882
you maintain alignment and get all the other disciplines on board and engaged with the

1353
00:57:22,882 --> 00:57:27,927
original vision you had as the LD? Also, what sorts of steps do you take to find potential

1354
00:57:27,927 --> 00:57:32,091
compromises, mitigate wake, and more as the design owner once it reaches their hands?

1355
00:57:32,392 --> 00:57:33,833
I'm sorry, I'm having trouble hearing you.

1356
00:57:33,833 --> 00:57:36,234
Can you start the question over again?

1357
00:57:36,234 --> 00:57:39,577
I'll just reiterate the first part of the question.

1358
00:57:39,577 --> 00:57:42,078
So other disciplines and teams are rolling on pretty far

1359
00:57:42,078 --> 00:57:43,439
into the design process.

1360
00:57:43,439 --> 00:57:45,941
Under those conditions, how do you maintain alignment

1361
00:57:45,941 --> 00:57:47,902
and get all the other disciplines on board

1362
00:57:47,902 --> 00:57:51,165
and engaged with the original vision that you had as the LD?

1363
00:57:51,165 --> 00:57:56,969
Yes, so the main question is, how do you keep everybody

1364
00:57:56,969 --> 00:57:57,489
on the same page?

1365
00:57:57,489 --> 00:57:58,530
Correct?

1366
00:57:58,530 --> 00:58:00,991
Yes, so communication.

1367
00:58:00,991 --> 00:58:01,352
It's real.

1368
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:03,381
Real dead simple, we would meet regularly,

1369
00:58:03,381 --> 00:58:04,002
we would talk about it.

1370
00:58:04,002 --> 00:58:05,464
And in the same kind of mindset

1371
00:58:05,464 --> 00:58:08,547
where I'm trying to involve the player

1372
00:58:08,547 --> 00:58:11,109
in the act of playing the game,

1373
00:58:11,109 --> 00:58:12,831
I'm always open to good ideas.

1374
00:58:12,831 --> 00:58:16,355
And the more good ideas that my team members bring to me,

1375
00:58:16,355 --> 00:58:17,656
the less work I have to do.

1376
00:58:18,585 --> 00:58:22,288
So I'm just really pro getting suggestions from everybody

1377
00:58:22,288 --> 00:58:23,610
on how the game should be designed.

1378
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:28,694
And it has the secondary benefit of that extra buy-in

1379
00:58:28,694 --> 00:58:30,997
helps not only just people commit to it,

1380
00:58:30,997 --> 00:58:33,159
but then all of a sudden they're evangelizing their ideas.

1381
00:58:33,159 --> 00:58:34,720
They're talking about the cool things they add.

1382
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:38,784
And then you get this group perspective on how things work.

1383
00:58:38,784 --> 00:58:42,207
So yeah, like communication, direction.

1384
00:58:42,732 --> 00:58:43,973
At Naughty Dog, it was a bit easier

1385
00:58:43,973 --> 00:58:46,534
because we didn't have dedicated producers,

1386
00:58:46,534 --> 00:58:50,316
so that extra communication had to be picked up by everybody.

1387
00:58:50,316 --> 00:58:51,876
So that's part of the benefit.

1388
00:58:51,876 --> 00:58:53,977
I don't know if I would necessarily recommend that

1389
00:58:53,977 --> 00:58:54,877
as a universal fix, though.

1390
00:58:54,877 --> 00:58:57,058
The second thing I wanted to ask is,

1391
00:58:57,058 --> 00:58:59,379
if you're reaching concept and geolock

1392
00:58:59,379 --> 00:59:01,420
that early into the process,

1393
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:02,561
what sorts of steps are you taking

1394
00:59:02,561 --> 00:59:04,502
to find potential compromises with teams

1395
00:59:04,502 --> 00:59:06,623
that can't deliver on the original intention,

1396
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:08,443
mitigating wake, et cetera?

1397
00:59:09,383 --> 00:59:11,384
So the main way we kind of approached that

1398
00:59:11,384 --> 00:59:13,424
was just trying to avoid that as much as possible

1399
00:59:13,424 --> 00:59:15,805
with that communication early on.

1400
00:59:15,805 --> 00:59:17,706
Trying to set expectations and the like.

1401
00:59:17,706 --> 00:59:21,527
There were very, you know, there were a lot of

1402
00:59:21,527 --> 00:59:22,867
reworks kind of taken from the top,

1403
00:59:22,867 --> 00:59:26,529
but rarely was it ever like, oh,

1404
00:59:26,529 --> 00:59:28,429
this team was so particularly behind schedule,

1405
00:59:28,429 --> 00:59:29,390
we had to cut things.

1406
00:59:29,390 --> 00:59:33,071
Again, that isn't anything with my certain process.

1407
00:59:33,071 --> 00:59:36,612
I think it's just the people involved

1408
00:59:36,612 --> 00:59:39,013
have been truly excellent at it for a long time.

1409
00:59:40,124 --> 00:59:42,265
Gotcha, thanks so much for the awesome talk.

1410
00:59:42,265 --> 00:59:42,965
Thank you.

1411
00:59:42,965 --> 00:59:43,905
Hi, thank you.

1412
00:59:43,905 --> 00:59:46,305
You were talking about in the blockout,

1413
00:59:46,305 --> 00:59:48,586
your main goals are to communicate the points

1414
00:59:48,586 --> 00:59:51,446
and beats you're trying to express in the level.

1415
00:59:51,446 --> 00:59:55,527
Are there any other basic interactions and systems

1416
00:59:55,527 --> 00:59:58,348
that you use as part of that blockout phase?

1417
00:59:58,348 --> 01:00:01,329
So the earliest, earliest version,

1418
01:00:01,329 --> 01:00:03,329
honestly, we would just get by

1419
01:00:03,329 --> 01:00:04,689
if we could walk around the level.

1420
01:00:04,689 --> 01:00:07,990
And like I said, the rest is just oral presentation,

1421
01:00:07,990 --> 01:00:09,770
riffing, just kind of.

1422
01:00:10,027 --> 01:00:11,207
pitching it in person.

1423
01:00:11,207 --> 01:00:14,370
It's not really a game, it's just a 3D storyboard

1424
01:00:14,370 --> 01:00:16,932
that you're puppeting around at that point.

1425
01:00:16,932 --> 01:00:20,114
When we shift into getting things towards first playable,

1426
01:00:20,114 --> 01:00:22,316
that's when we kind of shift out.

1427
01:00:22,316 --> 01:00:24,518
But yeah, we just ran out of time.

1428
01:00:24,518 --> 01:00:27,160
Hope that answered your question sufficiently.

1429
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:29,882
We'll be in the wrap-out room just next door

1430
01:00:29,882 --> 01:00:31,503
if you guys wanna ask me any other questions.

1431
01:00:31,503 --> 01:00:32,864
I'll be here for a while.

1432
01:00:32,864 --> 01:00:34,005
And thanks again for this talk.

1433
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:35,046
I'm really glad to be able to talk to you.

1434
01:00:39,690 --> 01:00:40,414
You
