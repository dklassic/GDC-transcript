1
00:00:04,596 --> 00:00:08,478
everybody. My name is Akash. Before we get into stuff we're

2
00:00:08,478 --> 00:00:11,339
actually going to play a trailer of hyper light drifter just to

3
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:13,980
make sure everything is on the same page. One thing I want to

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,901
remind you of or a couple of things I want to remind you of

5
00:00:15,901 --> 00:00:19,302
before we get started, turn off cell phones and noise makers and

6
00:00:19,302 --> 00:00:21,363
all that sort of stuff especially for an audio talk

7
00:00:21,363 --> 00:00:22,743
that would kind of ruin the audio.

8
00:00:22,984 --> 00:00:26,326
point of this if we hear your sweet metal gear codec ring

9
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:30,109
tone during this. Keep that on quiet. Also fill out those

10
00:00:30,109 --> 00:00:33,012
surveys that you'll get in your e-mail after the fact when the

11
00:00:33,012 --> 00:00:35,234
CA scanned you in. You'll get a survey in your inbox about how

12
00:00:35,234 --> 00:00:37,676
did you like this talk. And you're going to rate us the

13
00:00:37,676 --> 00:00:40,358
highest possible because you're going to love this. It's going

14
00:00:40,358 --> 00:00:43,060
to be the best. So let's play a trailer of Hyperlite and then

15
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,442
we'll get going. Looks good. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

16
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,063
Oh no. Hold up.

17
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:03,303
All right. Thank you. Goodbye. Yeah. That's Hyperlight Drifter.

18
00:02:03,303 --> 00:02:08,487
So a little bit about us. My name is Rich Freeland. I make

19
00:02:08,487 --> 00:02:14,492
sound and music for media under the name Disasterpiece. I've

20
00:02:14,492 --> 00:02:18,436
been doing that for about 11 years. And...

21
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:23,360
I'm a sound designer working in games for about five or six or so like that.

22
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,321
Rich and I actually went to school together.

23
00:02:26,321 --> 00:02:32,564
I met him by asking someone random in the hallway, like, where's the video game music

24
00:02:32,564 --> 00:02:33,664
club at the school?

25
00:02:33,664 --> 00:02:34,845
And it happened to be this guy.

26
00:02:34,845 --> 00:02:34,885
So.

27
00:02:34,885 --> 00:02:36,565
And Akash was a metal drummer, right?

28
00:02:36,565 --> 00:02:37,486
I was a metal drummer.

29
00:02:37,486 --> 00:02:38,866
He had hair down to like his feet.

30
00:02:38,866 --> 00:02:41,427
Yeah, like super long hair and a giant beard.

31
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:46,630
And for the only straight edge person at a music school, I was always asked for drugs.

32
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:52,031
It was a treat. It was just a treat. So I got on to this

33
00:02:52,031 --> 00:02:54,973
project literally just kind of in a funny way. So I already

34
00:02:54,973 --> 00:02:57,013
knew Rich already when the kick starter had already begun. It

35
00:02:57,013 --> 00:02:59,735
already got funded by the point I kind of got in touch with

36
00:02:59,735 --> 00:03:03,756
Alex Preston, the creative director. And I e-mailed Alex

37
00:03:03,756 --> 00:03:07,298
and Rich and said, like, do you need a sound designer? I'll do

38
00:03:07,298 --> 00:03:11,579
good. I'll be good. And Rich thankfully vouched for me. And

39
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:12,580
you said, yeah, he'll be good.

40
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,982
who do you know i don't think it'll do a good job that's kind of right to be

41
00:03:15,982 --> 00:03:17,423
he'll be alright okay okay

42
00:03:17,423 --> 00:03:22,668
uh... so that was kind of at the end of the conversation it kind of blossomed

43
00:03:22,668 --> 00:03:25,150
out of that just me sending a couple quick emails to rich and alex

44
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,972
thanks to you that all panned out but how did

45
00:03:27,972 --> 00:03:28,613
and to get on

46
00:03:28,613 --> 00:03:31,615
so i had a friend who uh... who does music as well for games and does game

47
00:03:31,615 --> 00:03:35,899
development who is friend of alex the creative director and uh... i guess they

48
00:03:35,899 --> 00:03:38,100
were talking about the project and uh... alex

49
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:44,546
knew that my friend knew me and so he wanted to get in touch with me through my friend. My

50
00:03:44,546 --> 00:03:49,312
friend was happy to put us in touch but also a little sad I think that he didn't get to work on

51
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:55,779
the project. But this was like around the time of the kick starter. So that's kind of how it's

52
00:03:55,779 --> 00:03:59,223
funny how just friends of friends of friends kind of. It's very meta.

53
00:04:00,392 --> 00:04:02,933
So we're going to get into quite a bit in this talk.

54
00:04:02,933 --> 00:04:07,075
We're going to talk about music, sound design, experimentation, and all sorts of little bits

55
00:04:07,075 --> 00:04:07,735
of nitty gritty.

56
00:04:07,735 --> 00:04:09,956
Of course we're going to leave plenty of time for questions at the end.

57
00:04:09,956 --> 00:04:15,058
So please feel free to ask those at the very end and we will answer them to the best of

58
00:04:15,058 --> 00:04:15,638
our ability.

59
00:04:15,638 --> 00:04:16,839
But let's start with the music.

60
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:22,383
Yes, so I wanted to talk about some of the initial experiments with music.

61
00:04:22,383 --> 00:04:29,769
So the first thing I wanted to show was the very first thing that I wrote for this game.

62
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:37,135
Kind of the thing that, you know, after kind of seeing footage of the game and kind of talking to Alex briefly about what the game was about.

63
00:04:37,135 --> 00:04:40,898
Kind of the first, you know, initial sketch idea. So let's play that.

64
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:28,039
Outro

65
00:05:52,975 --> 00:05:58,464
I guess Alex kinda like this one and it it pretty much ended up in the game and

66
00:05:58,464 --> 00:06:00,928
a version that's pretty close to this

67
00:06:00,928 --> 00:06:04,514
and it was a good just kind of initial step to kind of you know this is just

68
00:06:04,514 --> 00:06:07,659
just seeing sting and thinking about the world like I wanted to do something that

69
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:08,100
was kind of

70
00:06:08,609 --> 00:06:12,912
uh... deep and dark and and kinda had little uh...

71
00:06:12,912 --> 00:06:16,554
i don't know kind of ambiguous details and uh... so that was a good place to

72
00:06:16,554 --> 00:06:16,675
start

73
00:06:16,675 --> 00:06:16,735
uh...

74
00:06:16,735 --> 00:06:21,478
you know after that we kinda tried to do some experiments i had this idea where i

75
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:23,139
wanted to run the entire

76
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:24,840
soundtrack through uh...

77
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,661
through cassette

78
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:29,723
a cassette deck to give it like a more of an analog sound

79
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,505
but uh... doing that actually

80
00:06:31,505 --> 00:06:33,926
it like makes the

81
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:35,688
speed of the recording fluctuate

82
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:42,905
And so if you're trying to do dynamic music in a game where you have multiple layers of music that are

83
00:06:42,905 --> 00:06:45,327
moving through different

84
00:06:45,327 --> 00:06:52,473
scenarios and are meant to stay in sync with each other, if you're using a cassette, if you're running music through a cassette deck,

85
00:06:52,473 --> 00:06:57,357
you'll lose kind of the sync, the synchronization of the layers that all get like fall out of phase.

86
00:06:57,357 --> 00:06:59,298
So I had to scratch that idea. It didn't really make sense.

87
00:07:02,141 --> 00:07:06,264
Okay, and then, so in the beginning of the project, you know, I was writing,

88
00:07:06,264 --> 00:07:10,167
something that I like to do is sit at the piano and come up with lots of different ideas

89
00:07:10,167 --> 00:07:15,432
and just kind of try to let the project inspire me and see what comes out.

90
00:07:15,432 --> 00:07:19,074
And it doesn't necessarily mean that the music that I write is going to be music that we use,

91
00:07:19,074 --> 00:07:24,058
but it's a good place to start and kind of helps open the dialogue between me and Alex,

92
00:07:24,058 --> 00:07:28,982
who's the creative director and had a, you know, had a pretty strong vision.

93
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:29,042
So.

94
00:07:29,786 --> 00:07:34,432
I want to play for you kind of the original theme that I came up with for the game that

95
00:07:34,432 --> 00:07:36,455
I was really excited about.

96
00:07:36,455 --> 00:07:40,420
This is like a rough piano recording.

97
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:18,776
Thanks for watching!

98
00:08:36,046 --> 00:08:36,630
you

99
00:08:48,044 --> 00:08:48,785
You kind of get the idea.

100
00:08:48,785 --> 00:08:53,568
That was, you know, even though we didn't end up using that piece,

101
00:08:53,568 --> 00:08:57,691
because it didn't, it wasn't quite right for any particular moment

102
00:08:57,691 --> 00:09:00,373
in the project, and that happens quite a lot actually for me.

103
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,554
I'll write this kind of sweeping piece of music

104
00:09:02,554 --> 00:09:05,737
that maybe encapsulates a lot of the ideas that I have

105
00:09:05,737 --> 00:09:08,719
about what I want the aesthetics to be,

106
00:09:08,719 --> 00:09:12,742
what kind of emotional things I'm trying to capture.

107
00:09:12,742 --> 00:09:15,223
But from like a practical standpoint, there's nothing

108
00:09:15,223 --> 00:09:16,624
that I can like very directly.

109
00:09:16,985 --> 00:09:24,636
assign that music to. So in this case it kind of helped, don't worry about that right now,

110
00:09:24,636 --> 00:09:27,881
but in that case that piece helped with...

111
00:09:28,891 --> 00:09:32,273
kind of establishing certain adjectives and ideas about the music.

112
00:09:32,273 --> 00:09:36,215
You know, I wanted the music to be

113
00:09:36,215 --> 00:09:40,778
very dark, but also cinematic and have this sort of impressionistic

114
00:09:40,778 --> 00:09:45,500
style, kind of inspired by impressionist music, composers like

115
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,762
Ravel and Debussy and Satie

116
00:09:48,762 --> 00:09:50,503
and things like that. So

117
00:09:50,503 --> 00:09:53,345
it was a good kind of just to get into the headspace and figure out, you know,

118
00:09:53,345 --> 00:09:55,046
what is this going to sound like.

119
00:09:56,185 --> 00:10:00,526
And then so the last kind of initial experiment I wanted to talk about is

120
00:10:00,526 --> 00:10:03,927
I like to kind of experiment with the creative process and see if I can come up

121
00:10:03,927 --> 00:10:06,188
with new ways of coming up with material.

122
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,828
And so

123
00:10:07,828 --> 00:10:09,889
very early on in the process

124
00:10:09,889 --> 00:10:14,070
Alex really wanted to do an arena mode and of course if you play the

125
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:17,211
game you probably know that there is an arena mode in the final

126
00:10:17,211 --> 00:10:20,432
version that's based on waves where you kind of have a bunch of

127
00:10:20,432 --> 00:10:21,853
enemies and then you clear.

128
00:10:22,593 --> 00:10:29,978
Clear room and then another another wave comes and so we were kind of planning to do this music system

129
00:10:29,978 --> 00:10:35,582
And I had a friend who gave me these cue cards these flash cards with all the different notes

130
00:10:35,582 --> 00:10:36,983
of you know the chromatic scale and

131
00:10:36,983 --> 00:10:39,845
I kind of came up with this system

132
00:10:39,845 --> 00:10:46,929
where the bottom the bottom row of notes is like the bass and then you kind of you kind of draw like a

133
00:10:46,929 --> 00:10:48,330
This is kind of hard to explain

134
00:10:48,713 --> 00:10:55,327
you kind of draw like a tetronimo, like starting at the bottom, going up and then over three,

135
00:10:55,327 --> 00:10:59,155
and so the top four are like the right hand stuff, like uh...

136
00:10:59,813 --> 00:11:04,015
like chords, and then the left, the one on the bottom on the left is the bass, and so

137
00:11:04,015 --> 00:11:09,876
you have basically this idea of music that moves through every, basically moves through

138
00:11:09,876 --> 00:11:13,417
every tonality, like every key, and then it kind of loops back around.

139
00:11:13,417 --> 00:11:21,040
So this was kind of the starting point for this demo that I want to play, which is something

140
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,161
that I wrote for, it was a sketch for the arena mode very early on.

141
00:12:27,465 --> 00:12:29,967
So this piece we didn't end up using, but it helped solidify

142
00:12:29,967 --> 00:12:32,609
this idea of having up-tempo music in battle

143
00:12:32,609 --> 00:12:35,111
sequences in the game.

144
00:12:35,111 --> 00:12:38,974
So when you fight bosses, any sort of encounter

145
00:12:38,974 --> 00:12:39,975
that feels like that.

146
00:12:40,912 --> 00:12:44,372
this was in the game while we were developing it for a couple of months

147
00:12:44,372 --> 00:12:47,513
and it was during kind of uh... convention season

148
00:12:47,513 --> 00:12:48,453
where uh...

149
00:12:48,453 --> 00:12:51,954
they were taking the game around the demo of the game to different conventions

150
00:12:51,954 --> 00:12:52,834
and uh...

151
00:12:52,834 --> 00:12:56,235
you know alex the creative director would be on the floor talking to people

152
00:12:56,235 --> 00:12:59,115
showing the game and this music would be running in the background

153
00:12:59,115 --> 00:13:01,856
and it was just like you know fifty second loop

154
00:13:01,856 --> 00:13:06,536
and so he was hearing this music like probably six thousand times and uh...

155
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:07,397
he's just

156
00:13:07,397 --> 00:13:08,997
he started he hated it

157
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:10,157
he really really hated it

158
00:13:10,871 --> 00:13:15,476
And it's like, so I tried to stick it back in

159
00:13:15,476 --> 00:13:17,158
towards the end of the game.

160
00:13:17,158 --> 00:13:19,481
And he's like, what are you doing?

161
00:13:19,481 --> 00:13:20,802
No, you can't, you can't do this.

162
00:13:20,802 --> 00:13:23,866
I can, I have this extreme negative reaction to the song.

163
00:13:23,866 --> 00:13:26,389
So it never, even though it's one of my favorite ideas,

164
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:27,290
we never used it.

165
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:27,710
That's funny.

166
00:13:30,278 --> 00:13:33,360
All right. So let's talk a little bit about how the sound

167
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,401
design also worked as well. So I already gave a talk at GDC

168
00:13:36,401 --> 00:13:39,143
Europe about some of this stuff. So I want to make sure not to

169
00:13:39,143 --> 00:13:41,524
retread the same ground. But there's some stuff I'd like to

170
00:13:41,524 --> 00:13:45,626
mention for those of you who are new. So for this game, we did a

171
00:13:45,626 --> 00:13:49,128
lot of experimentation on both ends. But for sound design, I

172
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:53,510
decided to go with weird tech to get a lot of the sounds to sound

173
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:57,132
kind of distorted and crunchy and kind of nightmarish. Almost

174
00:13:57,132 --> 00:13:59,493
like some sort of Evangelion ish.

175
00:14:00,293 --> 00:14:03,514
awful neon nightmare sort of thing. So one of the first

176
00:14:03,514 --> 00:14:07,275
things that I went to was a wire recorder which is a 1950s

177
00:14:07,275 --> 00:14:09,435
recording device which I'll show you in just a second. It

178
00:14:09,435 --> 00:14:13,096
records on to this thin metal filament. It looks almost like

179
00:14:13,096 --> 00:14:15,857
fishing wire. It's before tape, before vinyl, all that sort of

180
00:14:15,857 --> 00:14:19,878
stuff. It creates this really crazy distorted sound when you

181
00:14:19,878 --> 00:14:21,718
record directly on to this metal wire.

182
00:14:22,239 --> 00:14:26,283
and when I got this thing it came with a whole bunch of recordings from the 1950s when this

183
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:29,647
thing was built. So you could hear recordings of people playing the piano.

184
00:14:30,237 --> 00:14:32,759
little girl learning a song for the first time, people listening

185
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:34,940
to the radio, people talking about their experiences during

186
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:40,323
World War II. I digitized all of it. So it's like a lot of cool

187
00:14:40,323 --> 00:14:43,124
historical sounds on this thing. So best $250 eBay purchase I've

188
00:14:43,124 --> 00:14:47,606
ever had. I also made a microphone out of a stethoscope,

189
00:14:47,606 --> 00:14:49,607
which is the most normal thing I'm sure all of you have heard

190
00:14:49,607 --> 00:14:52,369
of. So now that no one is confused, let's move on. No, in

191
00:14:52,369 --> 00:14:54,650
all seriousness, I basically used that to record a whole

192
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:57,732
bunch of sounds I couldn't get otherwise. So things like quiet

193
00:14:57,732 --> 00:14:59,513
machines, like fridges and freezers and

194
00:14:59,853 --> 00:15:03,097
my own blood, which I'm going to show you worked out as kind of an ambience near the

195
00:15:03,097 --> 00:15:04,159
end of the game.

196
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:08,445
And I eventually ended up deciding to use samples over synthesizers.

197
00:15:08,445 --> 00:15:08,865
Not entirely.

198
00:15:08,865 --> 00:15:13,872
There were plenty of synths, like Massive and stuff, built into a lot of the layers

199
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:15,094
of the sounds I ended up using.

200
00:15:15,554 --> 00:15:21,916
but the reason I decided to sample and record stuff using this wire recorder or my stethoscope

201
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:26,278
microphone or just field recorder or whatever mics I had handy was because it allowed me

202
00:15:26,278 --> 00:15:31,039
to have the sounds grounded a little bit in reality and then stylize out from there as

203
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:35,241
opposed to kind of grabbing things from the ether with a whole bunch of just pure synthesizers.

204
00:15:35,241 --> 00:15:39,742
So that allowed me to make things sound really, really stylish, but a shotgun could still

205
00:15:39,742 --> 00:15:41,923
sound like an otherworldly shotgun, for example.

206
00:15:42,564 --> 00:15:48,856
I think that's cool too because the music is kind of like very sort of ambiguous. Yeah, and everything's trying to be like

207
00:15:48,856 --> 00:15:49,016
kind of

208
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,801
otherworldly in some level even though some of the ideas are rooted in reality

209
00:15:53,801 --> 00:15:57,223
but I think it's a good counterbalance to have the sound effects be more.

210
00:15:57,223 --> 00:16:00,185
Everything kind of stuck out more as a result and

211
00:16:00,185 --> 00:16:04,688
separated itself in a good way and also most every sound was created from scratch.

212
00:16:04,688 --> 00:16:08,470
I barely used any library stuff. I maybe used a couple gunshots here and there as a

213
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:09,191
base

214
00:16:09,191 --> 00:16:12,833
or a couple explosions here and there as a base but most everything I record from

215
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:13,953
scratch in my

216
00:16:13,953 --> 00:16:17,395
one-bedroom apartment and just like had a carpet covered in sand

217
00:16:17,395 --> 00:16:19,296
just doing footsteps and all that sort of stuff.

218
00:16:19,737 --> 00:16:21,959
So that's kind of how the process went.

219
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:24,101
But I want to show you this wire recorder thing that I

220
00:16:24,101 --> 00:16:24,802
mentioned earlier.

221
00:16:24,802 --> 00:16:26,844
So this thing built in the 1950s.

222
00:16:26,844 --> 00:16:29,046
And what I want to show you real quick is just a quick

223
00:16:29,046 --> 00:16:31,628
video of what this thing actually sounds like.

224
00:16:31,628 --> 00:16:34,070
So I'm going to play you a quick video of just a

225
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:36,993
recording of some piano music that came onto this thing.

226
00:16:54,535 --> 00:16:58,678
So that song was probably like brand new at the time.

227
00:16:58,678 --> 00:17:00,098
Which is crazy.

228
00:17:00,098 --> 00:17:02,200
All the distortion and artifacts and stuff you heard

229
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,780
of like it slowing down and speeding up,

230
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,062
that wasn't like the microphone freaking out or anything.

231
00:17:06,062 --> 00:17:09,283
That's what it sounds like when you record onto metal wire.

232
00:17:09,283 --> 00:17:11,745
The craziest part is that it can snap in half.

233
00:17:11,745 --> 00:17:13,105
That wire snaps all the time.

234
00:17:13,105 --> 00:17:15,527
And the instruction manual even goes like,

235
00:17:15,527 --> 00:17:16,387
it's gonna break.

236
00:17:16,387 --> 00:17:18,528
It tells you that it's going to break.

237
00:17:18,528 --> 00:17:20,269
And when it snaps, like if you're close,

238
00:17:20,269 --> 00:17:21,610
it'll cut you, it'll cut you good.

239
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,731
And I'm serious.

240
00:17:23,731 --> 00:17:24,952
You have any scars?

241
00:17:24,952 --> 00:17:27,713
I don't have scars, but I've been cut on my hands a good amount.

242
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:31,794
And you have to physically take it and tie the metal filament back together.

243
00:17:31,794 --> 00:17:36,356
I don't know if any of you have tried to tie metal back together like a shoelace.

244
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:37,337
It's really hard.

245
00:17:37,337 --> 00:17:41,159
I'm glad this thing is deprecated and obsolete, but man, it gave a cool sound.

246
00:17:41,159 --> 00:17:43,279
So I'm going to show you some examples later.

247
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:47,641
But next up is this everyday normal looking device.

248
00:17:47,641 --> 00:17:49,942
Is that a stethoscope attached to a regular microphone?

249
00:17:49,942 --> 00:17:50,843
Absolutely it is, sir.

250
00:17:50,843 --> 00:17:50,923
Okay.

251
00:17:53,050 --> 00:18:01,055
ingenuity. So what I did was buy a cheap stethoscope off of Amazon for like five bucks. I think

252
00:18:01,055 --> 00:18:05,538
this was actually, yeah, five bucks-ish. I cut off the little ear hole thingy, so it's

253
00:18:05,538 --> 00:18:10,481
just a straight tube basically. And then looped that through a garden hose spigot, because

254
00:18:10,481 --> 00:18:13,563
why not, and then taped it, taped the hell out of it.

255
00:18:14,023 --> 00:18:19,348
to a very cheap small diaphragm condenser microphone. So then the signal of the stethoscope

256
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:24,633
goes direct into that microphone. And I can record regular everyday things like blood

257
00:18:24,633 --> 00:18:29,678
or the conversations on the other sides of windows. You know, just regular everyday stuff.

258
00:18:29,678 --> 00:18:35,083
Whatever I felt like that day. So what I'm about to play you is a recording of my own

259
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:38,266
blood basically. So what I did was just hold it up to my wrist.

260
00:18:38,854 --> 00:18:42,057
and just let to get really personal. It's gonna get real.

261
00:18:42,057 --> 00:18:45,321
And all I did was take that blood recording, pitch it down and add

262
00:18:45,321 --> 00:18:49,065
distortion to it and this ended up being a part of the ambience that was

263
00:18:49,065 --> 00:18:51,808
in the last boss battle. This kind of low rumble.

264
00:18:51,808 --> 00:18:55,292
For those who've played it and beaten it, you've all listened to my blood.

265
00:19:04,872 --> 00:19:05,812
I'll never look at you the same way.

266
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:08,893
I may have some health issues that I need to get checked out.

267
00:19:08,893 --> 00:19:12,914
But the cool thing is that a stethoscope has two sides to it,

268
00:19:12,914 --> 00:19:14,655
which I didn't know before I bought one.

269
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:19,296
So the larger flat side is a low frequency capturing ability.

270
00:19:19,296 --> 00:19:21,557
It has the ability to capture lower frequencies.

271
00:19:21,557 --> 00:19:24,278
And you can turn it around to the bell, which you're seeing

272
00:19:24,278 --> 00:19:25,218
facing upwards there.

273
00:19:25,218 --> 00:19:27,439
And that captures higher frequencies.

274
00:19:27,439 --> 00:19:30,080
So you can choose getting your breath or your heartbeat

275
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,581
and just turn it around that way.

276
00:19:31,581 --> 00:19:34,121
So it's like a contact mic that you can play around with.

277
00:19:34,121 --> 00:19:34,582
It's great.

278
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:37,416
it's pretty neat i'm i'm a big fan of it

279
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:41,528
okay so we're gonna talk about establishing style and getting

280
00:19:41,528 --> 00:19:42,150
creative direction

281
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:48,861
So how we use creative direction on this project,

282
00:19:48,861 --> 00:19:52,061
you know, we kind of had to feel out the dynamics of,

283
00:19:52,061 --> 00:19:53,902
I feel like you have to feel out the dynamics

284
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:57,142
of a relationship when you go into a project,

285
00:19:57,142 --> 00:20:01,043
figure out, you know, who's kind of the go-to person

286
00:20:01,043 --> 00:20:03,664
or is it more democratic when it comes to, you know,

287
00:20:03,664 --> 00:20:04,764
the creative direction of a project.

288
00:20:04,764 --> 00:20:08,745
And so in my experience, everyone tends to fall

289
00:20:08,745 --> 00:20:13,306
on some sort of scale when it comes to how they like to,

290
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:17,302
uh... you know

291
00:20:17,302 --> 00:20:21,305
uh... direct a project kind of ranging from hey you can do whatever you want

292
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:24,807
or to like you know uber control freak uh...

293
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:29,689
uh... like an uber-auteur. An auteur is kind of a phrase that

294
00:20:29,689 --> 00:20:33,971
I think fits well. An auteur is like someone, you know, usually a filmmaker

295
00:20:33,971 --> 00:20:37,513
who has a very singular vision about what they want and everyone's ideas kind

296
00:20:37,513 --> 00:20:38,413
of get funneled into them.

297
00:20:38,413 --> 00:20:41,754
And so uh... Alex, the creative director,

298
00:20:41,754 --> 00:20:44,076
in this case I would call him a friendly auteur

299
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:48,297
because he has a very singular vision but he's also malleable to external

300
00:20:48,297 --> 00:20:51,459
ideas and so he was he was really uh... pleasant to work with.

301
00:20:52,885 --> 00:20:57,207
Yeah, and he was the first artist director I've ever worked with, which is a treat, honestly.

302
00:20:57,207 --> 00:21:01,749
So he could use a lot of emotional words and give a lot of good feedback, kind of from

303
00:21:01,749 --> 00:21:04,990
his background, and it worked really, really freaking well.

304
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:05,591
I liked it a lot.

305
00:21:05,591 --> 00:21:09,692
There was no micromanaging happening, which was much appreciated, but he had opinions

306
00:21:09,692 --> 00:21:14,754
ready to kind of help both of us when either of us were stuck or maybe not hitting it as

307
00:21:14,754 --> 00:21:15,475
much as we could.

308
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:18,476
I hit like version 40 on some of those sound effects, so.

309
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,002
there were times where his opinion was extremely helpful to

310
00:21:23,002 --> 00:21:25,503
get things all kind of settled away. So we kind of crossed the

311
00:21:25,503 --> 00:21:31,327
streams a little bit throughout this whole project. There are

312
00:21:31,327 --> 00:21:35,689
some musical sound design elements and some sound designy

313
00:21:35,689 --> 00:21:38,231
musical elements that came across all throughout the

314
00:21:38,231 --> 00:21:40,292
project. And they just kind of popped up naturally. We never

315
00:21:40,292 --> 00:21:43,133
really discussed, like, oh, I'm going to do a musical sound

316
00:21:43,133 --> 00:21:46,435
design thing here or you're going to do some sound designy

317
00:21:46,435 --> 00:21:47,236
musical thing there.

318
00:21:47,716 --> 00:21:52,019
It's very natural, whatever kind of came up that we saw needed some work.

319
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:56,002
So basically what I'd like to play for you is if you've played it, there's a sound that

320
00:21:56,002 --> 00:22:00,806
happens whenever you pick up a module, and I decided to make it kind of a fun musical

321
00:22:00,806 --> 00:22:05,189
fanfare that isn't too positive, because this game is kind of dark.

322
00:22:05,189 --> 00:22:07,831
Nothing could sound too happy.

323
00:22:07,831 --> 00:22:11,393
Initially, though, it was kind of a, oh, let's make this sound kind of Zelda-ish.

324
00:22:11,393 --> 00:22:14,756
But if I went that far, then things did not work out well.

325
00:22:14,756 --> 00:22:16,597
We didn't want too much happiness.

326
00:22:16,863 --> 00:22:17,764
in this game.

327
00:22:17,764 --> 00:22:17,944
So...

328
00:22:17,944 --> 00:22:23,872
It's like, you did it, but it's still a pretty dark world.

329
00:22:23,872 --> 00:22:26,095
So don't get too happy.

330
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:29,079
Here's a moment of happiness for you, and back to it.

331
00:22:30,518 --> 00:22:35,583
Yeah, and then on the music front, you know in my in my process of making music

332
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:43,813
especially early on you know we were kind of concepting ideas for areas of the game that maybe didn't have any sound design yet or

333
00:22:43,813 --> 00:22:49,659
You know maybe Kosh put kind of a placeholder ambience there, and maybe it wasn't exactly what I wanted to explore so we kind of

334
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:54,121
we kind of set out to explore things separately on some occasions.

335
00:22:54,121 --> 00:22:58,903
And so, I wanted to play some sounds. This first sound is for

336
00:22:58,903 --> 00:23:02,904
the birds that live in the northern region of the game.

337
00:23:02,904 --> 00:23:06,405
They're kind of like cultish and I wanted to create this kind of like

338
00:23:06,405 --> 00:23:07,405
menacing

339
00:23:07,405 --> 00:23:12,527
sound of birds swarming and use that as like a texture in the

340
00:23:12,527 --> 00:23:13,547
music.

341
00:23:13,547 --> 00:23:14,888
So this is what that sounds like.

342
00:23:36,029 --> 00:23:37,149
It's so cool.

343
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:37,870
Is it menacing?

344
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:39,311
Very.

345
00:23:39,311 --> 00:23:41,333
So yeah, I mean, we use that in the music.

346
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:44,095
And down the line, we actually ended up

347
00:23:44,095 --> 00:23:46,157
kind of isolating some of these and using them

348
00:23:46,157 --> 00:23:49,600
as like straight ambience as well.

349
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:54,564
The next thing I wanted to play was two versions of a track.

350
00:23:55,064 --> 00:23:57,367
and the end of a track.

351
00:23:57,367 --> 00:23:59,609
Just to show that like a lot of the music in the game,

352
00:23:59,609 --> 00:24:02,533
I'm kind of thinking about like the,

353
00:24:02,533 --> 00:24:04,695
kind of the surroundings that the music is being used for

354
00:24:04,695 --> 00:24:06,277
and like, you know, are there,

355
00:24:06,277 --> 00:24:08,379
would there be animals in this environment?

356
00:24:08,379 --> 00:24:10,221
You know, what is the air sound like there?

357
00:24:10,221 --> 00:24:12,343
You're kind of thinking of music as sound design

358
00:24:12,343 --> 00:24:14,606
and thinking of, you know, what are sort of the,

359
00:24:15,427 --> 00:24:20,769
what are some of the things that I can achieve with the music that will help to establish the ambience.

360
00:24:20,769 --> 00:24:27,872
And so this piece that I'm going to play is for a section of in the eastern region of the world

361
00:24:27,872 --> 00:24:31,953
where it's kind of this like, it's like a water, outdoor water temple.

362
00:24:31,953 --> 00:24:35,074
It's, there's like running water everywhere.

363
00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:41,957
Yeah, so I'll play like the music, the end of the song with everything

364
00:24:41,957 --> 00:24:43,278
and then I'll play kind of the isolated.

365
00:25:06,211 --> 00:25:11,696
So there's like wind in there and hoots, like hooting sounds, like ambiguous animal sounds.

366
00:25:11,696 --> 00:25:14,819
So I'll play the isolated version now so you can hear them better.

367
00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:41,396
So just in general, I was trying to think of music as mimicking the reality of the world.

368
00:25:41,396 --> 00:25:46,558
And that wasn't just for animal sounds and wind or whatever.

369
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:52,779
It was also for creating kind of depth of atmosphere in some of the deeper regions.

370
00:25:52,779 --> 00:25:56,840
So when you go underground, a lot of times you hear this drum that's really big and kind

371
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,320
of far away.

372
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,020
It sounds like this.

373
00:26:01,471 --> 00:26:05,292
So I use that same sound like almost everywhere.

374
00:26:05,292 --> 00:26:06,853
I tried to play that out of my laptop speakers

375
00:26:06,853 --> 00:26:08,174
and nothing came out, it's so deep.

376
00:26:08,174 --> 00:26:12,375
Yeah, and it actually, I found that it worked really well

377
00:26:12,375 --> 00:26:14,356
in just kind of establishing like,

378
00:26:14,356 --> 00:26:15,977
there's something like really far away

379
00:26:15,977 --> 00:26:17,877
from where you are right now that's happening,

380
00:26:17,877 --> 00:26:19,398
or just something to create this sense

381
00:26:19,398 --> 00:26:21,479
of like really big, deep space.

382
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:23,119
And I feel like that helped a lot.

383
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:25,520
And then there are other sounds kind of of that ilk

384
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,261
that do similar things, like I had this kind of like,

385
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:33,282
this very far away like kind of electrical sound that I would use

386
00:26:33,282 --> 00:26:36,283
from time to time to kind of give the same impression and that sounds like

387
00:26:36,283 --> 00:26:36,663
this

388
00:26:36,663 --> 00:26:37,283
it's a it's kinda subtle

389
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:57,627
But in right moments, it kind of comes out of the mix a little bit and just helps to

390
00:26:57,627 --> 00:26:59,334
establish the environment there.

391
00:26:59,587 --> 00:27:05,188
And this other thing that I would do a lot is I would build these synth patches to use

392
00:27:05,188 --> 00:27:07,789
to play chords and melodies and things like that.

393
00:27:07,789 --> 00:27:12,070
But then I would like experiment with the sound because I have all these effects on

394
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,051
the sounds.

395
00:27:13,051 --> 00:27:18,592
If I go up like six octaves and try to play it, you get all these weird like aliasing

396
00:27:18,592 --> 00:27:20,213
effects and stuff that I wasn't expecting.

397
00:27:20,213 --> 00:27:24,554
And so I use that a lot to kind of create kind of just weird, weird sounds.

398
00:27:24,554 --> 00:27:28,275
So this is a little shrill, so prepare yourselves.

399
00:27:32,037 --> 00:27:32,718
That wasn't too bad.

400
00:27:32,718 --> 00:27:33,098
Yeah.

401
00:27:33,098 --> 00:27:43,164
So there are some kind of more iconic sounds in this game so we're gonna talk

402
00:27:43,164 --> 00:27:48,527
about some of those and Rich, your stinger is probably the most

403
00:27:48,527 --> 00:27:52,170
well-known. I can't take all the credit for this because Alex and I

404
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,470
had this process where

405
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:55,952
at some point I was struggling a little bit to find the sound of this game

406
00:27:55,952 --> 00:27:59,934
and so we just started a Dropbox folder where I just threw like

407
00:28:00,535 --> 00:28:02,636
tons and tons of piano sketches into it.

408
00:28:02,636 --> 00:28:04,698
There are probably like 100, 150 sketches in there.

409
00:28:04,698 --> 00:28:08,941
And him and I would just listen to them and talk about it and take notes.

410
00:28:08,941 --> 00:28:10,162
And he found this like,

411
00:28:10,162 --> 00:28:13,605
he found this like three chord thing in one of the sketches.

412
00:28:13,605 --> 00:28:14,966
And he's like, this should be the theme.

413
00:28:14,966 --> 00:28:17,108
And I was like, you're right, this is perfect.

414
00:28:17,108 --> 00:28:19,109
So this is what it was.

415
00:28:19,109 --> 00:28:20,290
This is the piano version.

416
00:28:31,477 --> 00:28:32,778
So we felt like it kind of did a lot.

417
00:28:32,778 --> 00:28:35,259
It was very evocative in a very short period of time.

418
00:28:35,259 --> 00:28:37,140
So that was something that we could probably latch onto.

419
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:41,822
And so, you know, that turned into,

420
00:28:41,822 --> 00:28:44,663
the first time that we got to use it

421
00:28:44,663 --> 00:28:47,625
was when we did the second trailer.

422
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:51,206
So this is that in the context of the trailer.

423
00:28:51,206 --> 00:28:51,526
Press it again.

424
00:29:08,869 --> 00:29:12,051
So it kind of worked, I think.

425
00:29:12,051 --> 00:29:16,134
Yeah, a little bit, yeah.

426
00:29:16,134 --> 00:29:19,297
And it's funny because talking about trailers,

427
00:29:19,297 --> 00:29:23,119
you know, the kind of the aesthetic and timbre of the theme

428
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:25,161
kind of came out of working on the trailer.

429
00:29:25,161 --> 00:29:26,502
And I have a lot of mixed feelings

430
00:29:26,502 --> 00:29:27,383
about working on trailers.

431
00:29:27,383 --> 00:29:29,784
I kind of prefer to work on the thing itself

432
00:29:29,784 --> 00:29:30,905
as opposed to getting caught up.

433
00:29:31,365 --> 00:29:35,710
in trailers, because sometimes it can take weeks to get the trailer right and it's very meticulous.

434
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:39,133
But in this case, for this game, it was so important.

435
00:29:39,133 --> 00:29:42,357
Like this trailer and the final trailer, which has piano in it,

436
00:29:42,357 --> 00:29:46,501
those were really important in kind of helping us to understand

437
00:29:46,501 --> 00:29:50,044
what it is, sonically, that we're trying to achieve with this game.

438
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:57,254
All right. So next up is some of the weapon sounds. And I spent probably the most amount

439
00:29:57,254 --> 00:30:01,477
of time on making the weapon sound as cool as humanly possible. So to do that, I did

440
00:30:01,477 --> 00:30:05,700
a technique that basically all sound design uses, and that's called layering. So every

441
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:11,185
time you hear any sort of sound effect in most any game or movie or any piece of media,

442
00:30:11,185 --> 00:30:15,388
every single sound is made up of multiple things playing at the same time. And the sound

443
00:30:15,388 --> 00:30:17,910
I'm about to play for you here is the diamond shotgun.

444
00:30:18,431 --> 00:30:21,774
And what that is is made up of nine different layers

445
00:30:21,774 --> 00:30:23,656
for each and every shot that you pull.

446
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:24,717
And there's two different versions of this,

447
00:30:24,717 --> 00:30:27,099
but I'm just gonna isolate one version for you.

448
00:30:27,099 --> 00:30:29,541
So in this video, this is just a video of me in Logic Pro,

449
00:30:29,541 --> 00:30:30,742
which is the software I used

450
00:30:30,742 --> 00:30:33,004
for all the sound design in this game.

451
00:30:33,004 --> 00:30:35,406
And basically I just walk you through each layer

452
00:30:35,406 --> 00:30:37,649
to see what they sound like individually.

453
00:30:37,649 --> 00:30:38,850
And then at the very end,

454
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:40,651
you'll hear how they all come together.

455
00:30:41,092 --> 00:30:43,755
And you might be wondering how I recorded all of this stuff.

456
00:30:43,755 --> 00:30:46,639
A lot of it is the result of that wire recorder,

457
00:30:46,639 --> 00:30:49,142
and that's how I could get kind of such strange,

458
00:30:49,142 --> 00:30:51,624
artifact-y, kind of distorted sounds.

459
00:30:51,624 --> 00:30:53,707
So this will walk you through every layer,

460
00:30:53,707 --> 00:30:54,828
and then all together at the end.

461
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,842
It's a little bassier in here.

462
00:31:10,842 --> 00:31:11,843
It's like a flutter echo, wow.

463
00:31:11,843 --> 00:31:14,986
Yeah, that delay is not actually a part of the effect.

464
00:31:14,986 --> 00:31:17,048
So if you're like, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,

465
00:31:17,048 --> 00:31:17,689
that's not a part of it.

466
00:31:17,689 --> 00:31:19,210
That's just the script.

467
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:22,114
So that's how I approached basically every single sound

468
00:31:22,114 --> 00:31:24,096
effect from the footsteps all the way to the weapon sounds

469
00:31:24,096 --> 00:31:27,619
to the monsters and everything in between is made up of

470
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:30,783
sometimes as much as 20 different layers of sound.

471
00:31:31,003 --> 00:31:32,284
So every single weapon you hear,

472
00:31:32,284 --> 00:31:34,026
and that's kind of the trick in a way

473
00:31:34,026 --> 00:31:36,107
to make things sound unique or iconic

474
00:31:36,107 --> 00:31:37,669
or special to that world,

475
00:31:37,669 --> 00:31:39,791
is building it up of different elements

476
00:31:39,791 --> 00:31:42,033
that on their own can sound like they fit

477
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:44,255
within that world, in this case like Hyper Light,

478
00:31:44,255 --> 00:31:46,537
but all together sound like its own cool, unique thing.

479
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:51,092
And next up is the kind of monster effects.

480
00:31:51,092 --> 00:31:53,814
So I've talked about this a little before, but this is Hal.

481
00:31:53,814 --> 00:31:55,375
He's the final boss of the game.

482
00:31:55,375 --> 00:31:57,557
This is an older animation, but it's a cool gif, so I

483
00:31:57,557 --> 00:31:59,458
thought I'd throw it in here.

484
00:31:59,458 --> 00:32:03,500
So for all the monster sounds, except for the wolves, you're

485
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:06,002
hearing my angelic voice being super processed.

486
00:32:06,002 --> 00:32:09,164
So all of the monster deaths and roars and all that sort of

487
00:32:09,164 --> 00:32:10,605
stuff, all them screaming is.

488
00:32:10,605 --> 00:32:13,587
What sad soul did you ask to do the wolf voice?

489
00:32:13,587 --> 00:32:15,568
I just had her wolf recording.

490
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:19,672
I have a pack of my own anyway.

491
00:32:19,672 --> 00:32:20,833
I just recorded them.

492
00:32:20,833 --> 00:32:22,014
They're my friends.

493
00:32:22,014 --> 00:32:23,095
Just curious.

494
00:32:23,095 --> 00:32:24,157
Yeah, yeah.

495
00:32:24,157 --> 00:32:26,079
You know, normal things.

496
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:32,746
So for this HAL character here, I needed this to sound completely different.

497
00:32:33,126 --> 00:32:35,289
from every other monster in the game.

498
00:32:35,289 --> 00:32:37,271
It needed to sound horrific.

499
00:32:37,271 --> 00:32:39,614
Alex Preston, the director, kept saying,

500
00:32:39,614 --> 00:32:40,755
it could sound really terrifying.

501
00:32:40,755 --> 00:32:42,498
I wanna sound scared when I hear this.

502
00:32:42,498 --> 00:32:45,902
So what I did was squeal like a pig into a microphone

503
00:32:45,902 --> 00:32:47,243
and then process the hell out of it.

504
00:32:48,662 --> 00:32:49,162
What?

505
00:32:49,162 --> 00:32:51,403
So what I'm gonna play for you is my raw voice,

506
00:32:51,403 --> 00:32:53,224
which will sound awful,

507
00:32:53,224 --> 00:32:54,685
screaming like a pig into a microphone,

508
00:32:54,685 --> 00:32:56,266
and then the processed version.

509
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:57,426
You're gonna do it live?

510
00:32:57,426 --> 00:32:57,466
No.

511
00:32:57,466 --> 00:32:58,087
Oh, come on.

512
00:32:58,087 --> 00:33:00,468
I actually thought I would.

513
00:33:00,468 --> 00:33:01,648
I was like, oh, maybe I should,

514
00:33:01,648 --> 00:33:04,710
and then I realized how much it hurts to do this.

515
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:06,611
It's so painful.

516
00:33:06,611 --> 00:33:08,312
I'm not a voice actor by any means,

517
00:33:08,312 --> 00:33:09,953
but it was good for monster effect.

518
00:33:09,953 --> 00:33:13,835
So here's the raw version of me screaming like a pig.

519
00:33:13,835 --> 00:33:13,915
Raw!

520
00:33:13,915 --> 00:33:17,757
So that's me.

521
00:33:20,394 --> 00:33:22,276
This is pro stuff right here.

522
00:33:22,276 --> 00:33:24,517
This is the real art.

523
00:33:24,517 --> 00:33:29,161
So now next up what I did was record that directly into my wire recorder,

524
00:33:29,161 --> 00:33:33,244
then put it back into Logic Pro and to do that there's no output on that thing.

525
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:34,985
They didn't have those back then.

526
00:33:34,985 --> 00:33:37,907
So what I did was just shove a microphone up against the speaker

527
00:33:37,907 --> 00:33:40,169
and then record it directly back into Logic Pro like it's an amp.

528
00:33:40,929 --> 00:33:44,372
and then what I did was take that sound that you just heard

529
00:33:44,372 --> 00:33:47,455
and time stretch it, reverb it, bit crush the hell out of it

530
00:33:47,455 --> 00:33:49,916
and add some reverb and this is the result.

531
00:33:49,916 --> 00:33:58,683
Yeah.

532
00:34:03,003 --> 00:34:06,625
So yes, all the monsters start from this seed,

533
00:34:06,625 --> 00:34:09,126
but thanks to the magic of old and new technology,

534
00:34:09,126 --> 00:34:11,647
it starts to sound a lot more unique

535
00:34:11,647 --> 00:34:12,688
and a part of this world.

536
00:34:12,688 --> 00:34:14,109
They all started from that one sound?

537
00:34:14,109 --> 00:34:14,809
Every single one.

538
00:34:14,809 --> 00:34:16,450
Every single one.

539
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:16,870
I'm just kidding.

540
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:21,692
So have you guys noticed these things

541
00:34:21,692 --> 00:34:23,333
and what they sound like?

542
00:34:27,499 --> 00:34:28,739
Anybody?

543
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:32,022
Okay, so this, so the sound of Hyperlite

544
00:34:32,022 --> 00:34:33,963
was something that Alex and I started talking about.

545
00:34:33,963 --> 00:34:36,565
I think it was just a random idea that I had,

546
00:34:36,565 --> 00:34:40,968
and he's like, yeah, that's cool, we should try that.

547
00:34:40,968 --> 00:34:51,895
So this is what those things sound like.

548
00:34:51,895 --> 00:34:51,935
Oh.

549
00:34:51,935 --> 00:34:52,235
Oh.

550
00:34:52,235 --> 00:34:52,316
Oh.

551
00:34:52,316 --> 00:34:52,476
Oh.

552
00:34:52,476 --> 00:34:52,696
Oh.

553
00:34:52,696 --> 00:34:52,736
Oh.

554
00:34:52,736 --> 00:34:52,796
Oh.

555
00:34:52,796 --> 00:34:54,237
Oh.

556
00:34:54,237 --> 00:34:54,537
Oh.

557
00:34:54,537 --> 00:34:54,897
Oh.

558
00:34:54,897 --> 00:34:55,077
Oh.

559
00:34:55,077 --> 00:34:55,338
Oh.

560
00:34:55,338 --> 00:34:55,578
Oh.

561
00:34:55,578 --> 00:34:55,718
Oh.

562
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:55,758
Oh.

563
00:34:55,758 --> 00:34:56,118
Oh, man.

564
00:34:56,118 --> 00:34:56,538
Go back?

565
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:07,468
Mission Conquered!

566
00:35:13,977 --> 00:35:17,718
So this is just like a subtle thing that we decided to do to kind of like, you know,

567
00:35:17,718 --> 00:35:19,759
what is the sound of hyperlight? Does it have a sound?

568
00:35:19,759 --> 00:35:22,561
And you know, there are these like, there are these little modules and stuff

569
00:35:22,561 --> 00:35:27,123
and pink stuff like in corners of like most of the rooms in the world.

570
00:35:27,123 --> 00:35:32,425
And so, you know, we made the sound and the sound is singular.

571
00:35:32,425 --> 00:35:34,466
So no matter how many of those objects that you have in a room,

572
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:40,109
you just hear the one sound, which I thought was kind of like a cool thing.

573
00:35:40,109 --> 00:35:42,510
I'm assuming almost nobody notices, but that's okay.

574
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:46,833
It's a nice touch.

575
00:35:46,833 --> 00:35:50,416
Oh, this is me.

576
00:35:50,416 --> 00:35:51,177
So, ambiences.

577
00:35:51,177 --> 00:35:53,578
This is a funny thing.

578
00:35:53,578 --> 00:35:54,399
We kind of...

579
00:35:54,399 --> 00:35:57,662
Akash set off in the sound design world

580
00:35:57,662 --> 00:36:01,284
and had his hands pretty full with figuring out these sounds.

581
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:03,486
And I kind of set off in the music world doing music.

582
00:36:03,486 --> 00:36:05,528
And I was doing a little bit of ambience, like,

583
00:36:05,528 --> 00:36:09,211
as part of the music at times, but not always.

584
00:36:09,211 --> 00:36:10,892
And at some point, towards the end of development,

585
00:36:10,892 --> 00:36:12,153
we kind of realized, like,

586
00:36:12,935 --> 00:36:16,478
we should probably have some ambiences in this game. That would probably help a lot.

587
00:36:16,478 --> 00:36:21,322
And it made a huge difference. And so basically,

588
00:36:21,322 --> 00:36:23,865
I was like, hey, gosh, is it cool if I just like start making

589
00:36:23,865 --> 00:36:26,927
ambiences? Because I didn't want to step on your feet.

590
00:36:26,927 --> 00:36:32,292
He was like, cool, go for it. So I just started making ambiences for the game

591
00:36:32,292 --> 00:36:34,935
and I actually hired an intern whose name is Curtis Mitchell

592
00:36:34,935 --> 00:36:36,056
who helped me.

593
00:36:37,357 --> 00:36:45,823
And he just kind of did a lot of foundational work for me and then I would come in and we'd kind of do the right effects to the sounds.

594
00:36:45,823 --> 00:36:51,947
We'd do like spotting sessions where we'd play and be like, oh this needs a sound, this needs a sound.

595
00:36:51,947 --> 00:36:56,710
And we did not use bitcrushers.

596
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:59,672
Actually there's no bitcrushing in the music or the ambience.

597
00:36:59,672 --> 00:37:03,435
And there's a ton of bitcrushing in the sound effects.

598
00:37:03,435 --> 00:37:05,496
Which is something that we, I think, just...

599
00:37:05,877 --> 00:37:12,401
kind of happened out of luck and helped to create, I think, a good contrast between the

600
00:37:12,401 --> 00:37:13,862
sounds and the music.

601
00:37:13,862 --> 00:37:18,666
It helps with the communication level of the sounds.

602
00:37:22,773 --> 00:37:27,015
So we did a lot of iteration on this whole sort of process in this game.

603
00:37:27,015 --> 00:37:31,678
They're basically, for me at least, nothing was really right on the first try.

604
00:37:31,678 --> 00:37:37,842
I think only one sound, which was the rail gun, is still at version 1 and I wish I took

605
00:37:37,842 --> 00:37:40,263
a screenshot of this, but Alex said, I want to marry this sound.

606
00:37:40,263 --> 00:37:40,884
It's like, yes!

607
00:37:41,693 --> 00:37:45,117
Yes. But everything else hit version 2 and above. Again, some...

608
00:37:45,117 --> 00:37:46,819
I can hear that sound in my head.

609
00:37:46,819 --> 00:37:48,921
Yeah, yes, awesome.

610
00:37:48,921 --> 00:37:51,784
So, yeah, so a lot of things took a good amount of time

611
00:37:51,784 --> 00:37:54,107
and a good amount of iteration to really get right.

612
00:37:57,465 --> 00:37:57,685
Sorry.

613
00:37:57,685 --> 00:37:58,706
I don't know what you're saying.

614
00:37:58,706 --> 00:38:00,868
Yeah, so the West music was something

615
00:38:00,868 --> 00:38:02,910
that went through a lot of iteration.

616
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:06,473
There were multiple versions of things.

617
00:38:06,473 --> 00:38:07,754
It kind of reached this point in the project

618
00:38:07,754 --> 00:38:10,196
where I thought, you know, maybe I should like,

619
00:38:10,196 --> 00:38:11,778
maybe I should write everything at the piano

620
00:38:11,778 --> 00:38:13,099
and like figure out the entire,

621
00:38:13,099 --> 00:38:15,001
these long like five, six minute songs

622
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:15,962
and then notate them.

623
00:38:15,962 --> 00:38:17,243
And maybe that will help me.

624
00:38:17,243 --> 00:38:19,185
And that was like, that was the wrong,

625
00:38:19,185 --> 00:38:20,626
totally the wrong decision.

626
00:38:20,626 --> 00:38:21,687
That didn't help at all.

627
00:38:21,687 --> 00:38:22,648
It was a total waste of time.

628
00:38:23,148 --> 00:38:25,652
But we kind of over time figured out that oh, yeah

629
00:38:25,652 --> 00:38:28,196
The music should probably be like these shorter pieces

630
00:38:28,196 --> 00:38:31,621
But have a lot of different variations of it so that the music can react

631
00:38:31,621 --> 00:38:37,389
Very quickly and we were also somewhat limited technically by the software that we used which we'll talk about a little bit later

632
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:40,611
And so, you know, that was a really important thing.

633
00:38:40,611 --> 00:38:48,014
And then another really important thing was this idea of kind of reappropriating my own ideas from the past.

634
00:38:48,014 --> 00:38:49,875
And this is something that I always bring to projects.

635
00:38:49,875 --> 00:38:56,318
I have a huge database of just musical ideas from the very beginning that I started writing music.

636
00:38:56,318 --> 00:39:00,399
And so, you know, I'll often like go back and find an idea from like six years ago that's like,

637
00:39:00,399 --> 00:39:02,300
oh yeah, this might work for this particular thing.

638
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,182
And then I'll dress it up so that it fits the project.

639
00:39:07,182 --> 00:39:11,064
And a lot of times when I'm stuck or just looking to mix

640
00:39:11,064 --> 00:39:13,164
it up, that helps a lot.

641
00:39:13,164 --> 00:39:16,426
And did, oh, I think we forgot to use that.

642
00:39:16,426 --> 00:39:16,946
No, that's all right.

643
00:39:16,946 --> 00:39:18,026
OK, so let me just skip over that.

644
00:39:18,026 --> 00:39:20,507
Actually, no, I'll just mention it real quick.

645
00:39:20,507 --> 00:39:21,868
There's this funny thing.

646
00:39:21,868 --> 00:39:24,849
It's called Teddy Dieffenbach, who's a

647
00:39:24,849 --> 00:39:27,590
programmer on HyperLite.

648
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:30,451
He put this secret sound effect in the

649
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:31,572
game called Shack Jack.

650
00:39:31,805 --> 00:39:33,488
Which confused the hell out of me when I found it.

651
00:39:33,488 --> 00:39:35,891
So when you're editing, when you're using the game editor,

652
00:39:35,891 --> 00:39:42,381
it was kind of like, maybe there's a 1% chance that when you hit the save button,

653
00:39:42,381 --> 00:39:43,503
you'd hear Teddy going,

654
00:39:43,503 --> 00:39:44,304
Shackjack!

655
00:39:47,108 --> 00:39:49,830
when I discovered SND underscore shack jack and the game maker

656
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:54,333
thing I was like what is this? I didn't put this here. I can't

657
00:39:54,333 --> 00:39:59,217
believe I forgot to put this in the talk but basically the I

658
00:39:59,217 --> 00:40:01,279
just messing around with the sound one day and I was like

659
00:40:01,279 --> 00:40:03,921
wow if you pitch this down and start to mess with it like

660
00:40:03,921 --> 00:40:07,524
granular effects and stuff it kind of sounds like the boss.

661
00:40:07,524 --> 00:40:11,867
So actually when you in the boss room when you first open the

662
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:13,788
door you hear Teddy going.

663
00:40:16,135 --> 00:40:23,140
Jack. It works really well. I think it works pretty well. So

664
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:26,462
we stuck that in there. Thanks, Teddy, wherever you are. Okay.

665
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:32,621
All right, so what I did, well, kind of how we kind of

666
00:40:32,621 --> 00:40:35,762
started to get better and better at working on stuff

667
00:40:35,762 --> 00:40:38,102
is just through trying and trying again.

668
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:39,402
Again, like not for me at least,

669
00:40:39,402 --> 00:40:40,783
nothing was really right on the first try

670
00:40:40,783 --> 00:40:43,683
except for that one railgun sound.

671
00:40:43,683 --> 00:40:46,084
So Alex was really, really good at using

672
00:40:46,084 --> 00:40:47,924
super descriptive emotional words,

673
00:40:47,924 --> 00:40:50,885
which for sound designers is super freaking rad.

674
00:40:50,885 --> 00:40:52,265
I really, really like using that.

675
00:40:52,265 --> 00:40:53,886
If someone says make this sound lonely

676
00:40:53,886 --> 00:40:56,666
or make this sound desolate or whatever it may be,

677
00:40:56,666 --> 00:40:58,487
I'm a huge, huge fan of that.

678
00:40:59,007 --> 00:41:03,398
So, for example, one of the sounds that we created was this kind of frog enemy dying.

679
00:41:03,398 --> 00:41:04,701
So I'm going to play you version one.

680
00:41:06,293 --> 00:41:10,136
So that's a frog dying, being stabbed.

681
00:41:10,136 --> 00:41:11,076
Ouch. Ouch.

682
00:41:11,076 --> 00:41:13,158
But not ouch enough, Rich.

683
00:41:13,158 --> 00:41:17,721
So what Alex said was something along the lines of like,

684
00:41:17,721 --> 00:41:19,522
I want this to sound like agonizing.

685
00:41:19,522 --> 00:41:20,983
I want us to feel kind of sad

686
00:41:20,983 --> 00:41:25,187
or just kind of disgusted a little bit when this thing dies.

687
00:41:25,187 --> 00:41:27,909
So again, using my beautiful angelic voice,

688
00:41:27,909 --> 00:41:30,891
this is what ended up being the end frog death sound.

689
00:41:30,891 --> 00:41:31,011
So just.

690
00:41:33,998 --> 00:41:38,066
that thing didn't want to die but it did

691
00:41:38,066 --> 00:41:38,147
uh...

692
00:41:38,147 --> 00:41:38,968
that's gnarly uh...

693
00:41:40,474 --> 00:41:48,036
And then on the music side of getting better, Alex and I had many, many very long philosophical

694
00:41:48,036 --> 00:41:52,337
discussions about the music and kind of what he was looking for and what my agenda was.

695
00:41:52,337 --> 00:41:56,058
And that was something that was really nice about Alex is that he had a very strong vision

696
00:41:56,058 --> 00:42:01,939
for what he wanted, but he was also willing for us to have these discussions about kind

697
00:42:01,939 --> 00:42:04,640
of how I saw the project and what I was bringing to the table.

698
00:42:05,418 --> 00:42:10,000
And we often found the right solution to things by just having these really long conversations

699
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,661
and talking it out and kind of finding our common ground and reaching.

700
00:42:13,661 --> 00:42:20,183
Like the better I understood what his vision was, the more it informed my vision and I

701
00:42:20,183 --> 00:42:23,364
kind of allowed him to influence me and I think it was kind of, you know, a two-way

702
00:42:23,364 --> 00:42:24,225
street in that regard.

703
00:42:24,225 --> 00:42:29,246
And so, you know, one thing that we kind of figured out, you know, Alex wanted a lot of

704
00:42:29,246 --> 00:42:31,727
melody in the game and I didn't really want any melody.

705
00:42:31,727 --> 00:42:33,848
I wanted it to be really subtle because...

706
00:42:34,227 --> 00:42:41,491
For me as an artist, I'm very cognizant of not wanting to do the same thing over.

707
00:42:41,491 --> 00:42:48,555
And so, you know, coming from like, to me this was in some ways a spiritual successor for me to the work I did on Fez.

708
00:42:48,555 --> 00:42:54,178
But Fez is very like melodic, and so I wanted to do something that was much more kind of understated in that regard.

709
00:42:54,939 --> 00:43:00,200
But we kind of reached this compromise where you know for and it's not really a compromise because I agree with it now

710
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:04,841
But basically for like bosses and vistas which are these moments where you know you might see

711
00:43:04,841 --> 00:43:07,482
Titan like a big big dead robot way in the distance

712
00:43:07,482 --> 00:43:13,184
We'd have the music kind of sweep sweep up and kind of get kind of cinematic and have some kind of melody

713
00:43:14,004 --> 00:43:21,750
And everything else is kind of more subtle, so I think it helps to build kind of this contrast and this kind of dynamism in the music.

714
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:28,514
And then also in that same regard, you know, one of the things I took from Fez was that we used ambience a lot to create space

715
00:43:28,514 --> 00:43:31,776
and to give the player a chance to breathe between areas and things like that.

716
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:36,259
So there are a lot of moments in the game where there's no music, it's just ambience, just to kind of like...

717
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,942
give the player a beat, give the player a moment to kind of catch their breath

718
00:43:39,942 --> 00:43:43,684
and things like that. Kind of play the game, kind of get a feel for what the

719
00:43:43,684 --> 00:43:47,827
the momentum of the game is, the rhythm of the game basically

720
00:43:47,827 --> 00:43:51,049
and kind of see, you know, where can I kind of push

721
00:43:51,049 --> 00:43:55,352
the emotions, where can I help the player like relax a little bit, especially in a

722
00:43:55,352 --> 00:43:58,734
game like this that's so demanding and can get really kind of

723
00:43:58,734 --> 00:44:02,536
frustrating. It was important to have, to try to

724
00:44:02,536 --> 00:44:05,638
inject some moments where the player could maybe feel a little bit more relaxed.

725
00:44:09,514 --> 00:44:12,475
So we worked remotely, Rich and I.

726
00:44:12,475 --> 00:44:13,995
You were in Berkeley at the moment?

727
00:44:13,995 --> 00:44:14,975
I was in Berkeley at the time.

728
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:16,356
And I was in Seattle.

729
00:44:16,356 --> 00:44:19,636
So we were remote while everyone else was at Glitch City in LA.

730
00:44:19,636 --> 00:44:23,477
And Slack was the best.

731
00:44:23,477 --> 00:44:24,257
Slack was everything.

732
00:44:24,257 --> 00:44:25,577
It was literally everything.

733
00:44:25,577 --> 00:44:27,298
It was such a huge help.

734
00:44:27,298 --> 00:44:29,838
We used Asana as well to kind of track bugs,

735
00:44:29,838 --> 00:44:31,539
but it was not the best.

736
00:44:31,539 --> 00:44:33,659
Everyone used Asana, really.

737
00:44:33,659 --> 00:44:36,020
I don't really like Asana, but we did use it to track bugs.

738
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,142
Yeah, I use it to track a few assets here and there, but

739
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:40,265
really I just made a Google spreadsheet, and that's kind of

740
00:44:40,265 --> 00:44:41,366
the best way to do it.

741
00:44:41,366 --> 00:44:46,492
And at least on my end, Alex and I had weekly calls to work

742
00:44:46,492 --> 00:44:49,435
stuff out, even if we had nothing to update one another

743
00:44:49,435 --> 00:44:52,038
on, we made sure to get on Skype or on the phone.

744
00:44:52,339 --> 00:44:54,820
hey, how are you doing? Good? Cool. Anything this week? Nah.

745
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:57,342
All right. See ya. Even if it was that, that was really

746
00:44:57,342 --> 00:45:01,185
helpful to make sure as working remotely that I wasn't forgotten

747
00:45:01,185 --> 00:45:04,067
or that I didn't forget them to keep working on whatever was

748
00:45:04,067 --> 00:45:06,989
needed. And it was really helpful in case an enemy got

749
00:45:06,989 --> 00:45:09,811
caught or a huge feature got caught or something got added. I

750
00:45:09,811 --> 00:45:12,833
was made sure to stay in the loop because in the early days

751
00:45:12,833 --> 00:45:15,275
of this project we didn't have that set up and that kind of

752
00:45:15,275 --> 00:45:17,516
led to some stuff like, oh, I'm finished this sound for this

753
00:45:17,516 --> 00:45:19,037
thing. Doesn't exist anymore.

754
00:45:20,389 --> 00:45:21,530
Oh.

755
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:28,894
It was similar for me for a long time, just having periodic calls, which were really helpful.

756
00:45:28,894 --> 00:45:34,678
But towards, at some point I, you know, the game was made in Los Angeles and that's not

757
00:45:34,678 --> 00:45:39,141
that far, so I was like, you know, I should just go there more often and hang out and

758
00:45:39,141 --> 00:45:39,921
get to know the team.

759
00:45:39,921 --> 00:45:40,061
And...

760
00:45:40,842 --> 00:45:46,464
It'll be, you know, I think it'll be good. So I started doing that. I started going for weeks at a time

761
00:45:46,464 --> 00:45:49,345
and staying at Alex's house, sleeping on his couch.

762
00:45:49,345 --> 00:45:54,207
And, you know, I got to go to meetings with the team and, you know, hang out with the team

763
00:45:54,207 --> 00:45:59,970
and kind of get to know them. But I still kind of isolated myself so that I could focus

764
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:03,111
because it's hard to write music in like a co-working space.

765
00:46:03,111 --> 00:46:05,912
It can be tough when there's no like designated area for you.

766
00:46:07,153 --> 00:46:11,856
But it was good for morale, I think, and it was good for being on the same page.

767
00:46:11,856 --> 00:46:15,399
And I think having closer relationships with the people that you work with just kind of

768
00:46:15,399 --> 00:46:17,821
it boosts accountability for me personally.

769
00:46:17,821 --> 00:46:21,964
And it makes me want to do a good job even more.

770
00:46:21,964 --> 00:46:22,464
Yeah.

771
00:46:22,464 --> 00:46:27,068
So a lot of people asked me and probably you as well, like, how did we kind of work together

772
00:46:27,068 --> 00:46:28,989
to get things done?

773
00:46:28,989 --> 00:46:31,771
And we didn't.

774
00:46:31,771 --> 00:46:33,493
So in all honesty.

775
00:46:33,493 --> 00:46:35,194
So we didn't.

776
00:46:36,415 --> 00:46:38,356
We didn't do this intentionally, we're not like,

777
00:46:38,356 --> 00:46:41,238
oh, I hate you, Rich, let's never talk again.

778
00:46:41,238 --> 00:46:43,579
What kind of happened is that we talked

779
00:46:43,579 --> 00:46:44,759
at the very beginning of the project

780
00:46:44,759 --> 00:46:45,860
when I was brought on on a Skype call,

781
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:47,921
laid some things out here and there

782
00:46:47,921 --> 00:46:48,801
that I don't even remember,

783
00:46:48,801 --> 00:46:51,943
and then throughout the rest of the three-year project,

784
00:46:51,943 --> 00:46:54,424
we maybe chatted three or four times.

785
00:46:54,424 --> 00:46:55,765
Yeah, very infrequently.

786
00:46:55,765 --> 00:46:58,346
If it wasn't for Alex, it was kind of like a triangle,

787
00:46:58,346 --> 00:47:01,988
like he was kind of, you know, he was funneling both of us.

788
00:47:01,988 --> 00:47:03,288
If it wasn't for him, I mean,

789
00:47:03,288 --> 00:47:04,809
we might have ended up with totally.

790
00:47:06,389 --> 00:47:11,474
Totally different. Yeah, unrelated work. Yeah, and looking back. We should have

791
00:47:11,474 --> 00:47:19,782
More would have been good. I think I think there was something where the maybe the

792
00:47:19,782 --> 00:47:25,207
Whatever our connection was just wasn't quite gelling or something because yeah

793
00:47:25,207 --> 00:47:25,928
Yeah, but I don't know

794
00:47:26,918 --> 00:47:33,029
So we used GameMaker for getting all of our sounds and music into the game, which was a little bit of a challenge.

795
00:47:33,029 --> 00:47:38,778
Yeah, we didn't intentionally use GameMaker, but GameMaker is the software that was used for the game.

796
00:47:38,778 --> 00:47:40,742
And, you know, they were really helpful actually, and kind of...

797
00:47:41,585 --> 00:47:47,310
iterating on GameMaker itself to give us the tools that we needed to do a good job.

798
00:47:47,310 --> 00:47:54,316
And so they helped us with things like adding Ogvorbis support and doing things with like

799
00:47:54,316 --> 00:47:59,360
adding more memory support for like streaming multiple streams of music and things like

800
00:47:59,360 --> 00:47:59,940
that.

801
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:05,545
And, you know, we also had two programmers who were super helpful, extremely helpful

802
00:48:05,545 --> 00:48:08,427
and wanted to, you know, do good by us.

803
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:08,688
And so...

804
00:48:11,349 --> 00:48:22,553
Yeah, so we did a lot of mixing and things where music changes over time by using...

805
00:48:25,778 --> 00:48:28,901
a script editor. This is a screenshot, an early screenshot of the editor.

806
00:48:28,901 --> 00:48:34,825
It's kind of nuts. It's not ideal but you know it does the job and

807
00:48:34,825 --> 00:48:37,948
it helped in the long run for everybody. So basically we had this visual

808
00:48:37,948 --> 00:48:42,211
scripting language where you know we would place sounds, we would place

809
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:44,833
music in the world, there were little boom boxes which was kind of fun.

810
00:48:44,833 --> 00:48:48,476
And you could attach them to different things like regions where...

811
00:48:48,817 --> 00:48:52,098
the character, if the character walks into this region, you know, you do a thing with

812
00:48:52,098 --> 00:48:56,299
the music, you fade it in, you fade it out, whatever. And also we had this, we had group,

813
00:48:56,299 --> 00:48:59,540
a group system for the music, so, you know, you could have a bunch of different versions

814
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:02,361
of the same track that kind of crossfade between each other. And then we had things like, um,

815
00:49:10,207 --> 00:49:12,989
Oh yeah, we did a lot of conditional music triggering.

816
00:49:12,989 --> 00:49:15,351
So, based on the position of the player,

817
00:49:15,351 --> 00:49:17,392
camera events, like special camera events,

818
00:49:17,392 --> 00:49:19,674
like when you see the jackal,

819
00:49:19,674 --> 00:49:21,355
if you know the jackal character.

820
00:49:21,355 --> 00:49:22,096
Hands over.

821
00:49:22,096 --> 00:49:22,917
Spoiler.

822
00:49:22,917 --> 00:49:25,979
Enemy events, like if all the enemies are dead, do this,

823
00:49:25,979 --> 00:49:28,001
or if one of the enemies is dead, do this.

824
00:49:28,001 --> 00:49:28,981
Special events, et cetera.

825
00:49:28,981 --> 00:49:32,124
You know, no middleware, it was all directly

826
00:49:32,124 --> 00:49:33,985
in the editor with everybody else.

827
00:49:33,985 --> 00:49:36,247
We were all kind of working in the same tool, which was.

828
00:49:37,615 --> 00:49:41,937
interesting is interested in bad uh... and uh... we we actually want one last

829
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:45,418
thing that i want to say is that i had to rebuild the system uh... for

830
00:49:45,418 --> 00:49:47,019
positional ambiences

831
00:49:47,019 --> 00:49:50,780
so you know we were doing and uses for the game but the ambience is really

832
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:54,202
general and uses like winds that you hear everywhere

833
00:49:54,202 --> 00:49:56,823
at some point i realize you know there are a lot of like these little sounds

834
00:49:56,823 --> 00:49:57,724
like

835
00:49:57,724 --> 00:50:01,705
like uh... torches like uh... lamps uh...

836
00:50:01,705 --> 00:50:04,567
things that are like but the hyper light stuff that that that is all

837
00:50:04,567 --> 00:50:05,727
positional so you know

838
00:50:06,187 --> 00:50:11,515
he helped build this system where you could have sounds in the environment that you could

839
00:50:11,515 --> 00:50:16,062
walk past and it would get louder, get quieter. It's not rocket science. It's been in games

840
00:50:16,062 --> 00:50:19,647
for a long time. But it wasn't something that, I don't think it was something that GameMaker

841
00:50:19,647 --> 00:50:21,330
really did. So we had to build it.

842
00:50:26,407 --> 00:50:31,471
So this question I'm sure we'll get a lot just so we can cover it now.

843
00:50:31,471 --> 00:50:35,615
For me on my end for software and sound design and all that sort of good stuff I use Logic

844
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:36,336
Pro.

845
00:50:36,336 --> 00:50:39,159
Nowadays I use Nuendo and Reaper for all that sort of stuff.

846
00:50:39,159 --> 00:50:39,979
But Logic Pro is great.

847
00:50:39,979 --> 00:50:41,461
All the built in plugins are fantastic.

848
00:50:42,001 --> 00:50:46,763
Lots of bit crushers, the built in bit crusher in Logic is what I used a lot of, and that

849
00:50:46,763 --> 00:50:48,984
helped a ton, it was actually quite good.

850
00:50:48,984 --> 00:50:55,107
And for synths and a lot of things like Massive and Complete, or AppSynth and all that sort

851
00:50:55,107 --> 00:50:59,849
of stuff, I used Native Instruments Complete, it's a great sort of all in one package for

852
00:50:59,849 --> 00:51:02,571
music and sound design software, I really, really liked it.

853
00:51:02,571 --> 00:51:06,753
I also used Reverb a lot, that was my favorite effect and still is to this day, it's like

854
00:51:06,753 --> 00:51:09,674
the fairy dust of the music and sound design world, just put more on and it'll be better.

855
00:51:11,075 --> 00:51:17,439
But I use Audio Damage EOS, which is like the darkest, most beautiful sounding reverb

856
00:51:17,439 --> 00:51:20,501
with an infinite setting, so I really like that.

857
00:51:20,501 --> 00:51:21,822
Cool.

858
00:51:21,822 --> 00:51:25,685
I use a lot of, I use Massive almost exclusively for the music.

859
00:51:25,685 --> 00:51:28,747
It's just a synth that I'm really comfortable with.

860
00:51:28,747 --> 00:51:34,271
And I wanted to do something different than what we did with Fez, so I very early on decided

861
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:35,632
I don't want to use any Bitcrushers at all.

862
00:51:36,924 --> 00:51:41,326
So we kind of went for a more tape analog kind of sound.

863
00:51:41,326 --> 00:51:45,668
And so I kind of played a lot, tried to play a lot with saturation and distortion.

864
00:51:45,668 --> 00:51:50,250
And also baking things into the signal chain to kind of like...

865
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:55,992
You know, you can put reverb at the end of the signal chain on a sound and then it sounds like it's in a room.

866
00:51:55,992 --> 00:51:59,613
But if you use it really early in the signal chain and you mess with the stereo imaging, like you can...

867
00:52:00,113 --> 00:52:04,595
you can put a mono reverb on a sound and then you can bake things on top of that

868
00:52:04,595 --> 00:52:06,275
and then it becomes a texture.

869
00:52:06,275 --> 00:52:10,036
And so I try to use reverb a lot as a texture,

870
00:52:10,036 --> 00:52:13,457
as a tool to kind of paint and create different textures for sounds.

871
00:52:13,457 --> 00:52:17,078
And... Oh, we already said that.

872
00:52:17,078 --> 00:52:20,258
I think me not using Bitcrushers and you using Bitcrushers

873
00:52:20,258 --> 00:52:22,959
kind of helped the sound stand out.

874
00:52:23,867 --> 00:52:26,590
So lastly before we finish up, we just have a few take aways

875
00:52:26,590 --> 00:52:30,533
for you, just kind of lessons we learned on how to work with

876
00:52:30,533 --> 00:52:31,774
us audio folk.

877
00:52:31,774 --> 00:52:35,237
So the first thing is hire early, as early as you can.

878
00:52:35,237 --> 00:52:37,759
And that's always a nice thing to have.

879
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:41,442
It is a little bit typical to see audio kind of brought in

880
00:52:41,442 --> 00:52:42,383
at the very last moment.

881
00:52:42,843 --> 00:52:44,344
And that's no good.

882
00:52:44,344 --> 00:52:46,807
Having the ability to kind of fail upwards

883
00:52:46,807 --> 00:52:49,249
with the rest of the team is always really appreciated

884
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:50,049
for all disciplines.

885
00:52:50,049 --> 00:52:51,851
I always like to say that game development

886
00:52:51,851 --> 00:52:53,893
is nothing but a whole bunch of people failing

887
00:52:53,893 --> 00:52:55,674
until something happens.

888
00:52:55,674 --> 00:52:57,736
So make sure that your audio people

889
00:52:57,736 --> 00:53:00,559
also have that ability to fail and grow upwards

890
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:01,480
with the rest of the team.

891
00:53:04,665 --> 00:53:07,407
I mean, this one I'm not sure I agree with, but it's okay.

892
00:53:07,407 --> 00:53:08,207
It's all right, go for it.

893
00:53:08,207 --> 00:53:11,610
I mean, have opinions ready, but don't micromanage.

894
00:53:11,610 --> 00:53:14,011
I think that's nice if you're someone

895
00:53:14,011 --> 00:53:15,953
who has strong opinions, but it's also okay

896
00:53:15,953 --> 00:53:18,294
to be someone who, you know,

897
00:53:18,294 --> 00:53:19,975
Zakay, I really like what you do,

898
00:53:19,975 --> 00:53:23,758
and I want to see what your vision is for this project.

899
00:53:23,758 --> 00:53:26,460
To bring someone in and have them self-direct is also okay.

900
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:29,622
But I think in general, micromanaging is something

901
00:53:29,622 --> 00:53:31,023
that nobody really likes.

902
00:53:31,023 --> 00:53:31,423
Yeah, agreed.

903
00:53:32,093 --> 00:53:35,175
So like we mentioned, allow a lot of time for experimentation,

904
00:53:35,175 --> 00:53:38,177
that failure and all that stuff, because you can get a lot of

905
00:53:38,177 --> 00:53:42,900
weird results of letting that kind of time really cook and

906
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:44,701
bake and all that sort of stuff.

907
00:53:44,701 --> 00:53:47,843
Especially if you're like, hey, Akash, here's a week where you

908
00:53:47,843 --> 00:53:48,764
can just record some stuff.

909
00:53:48,764 --> 00:53:51,545
I'm like, I'm going to build a stethoscope microphone.

910
00:53:51,545 --> 00:53:53,467
So if you give enough time, that sort of

911
00:53:53,467 --> 00:53:54,547
nonsense starts to happen.

912
00:53:54,547 --> 00:53:56,188
And it can be for the better of the game.

913
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:03,924
And don't let don't let us work together. It's bad. It's a bit. No, just kidding. Oh, we should have talked more for sure

914
00:54:03,924 --> 00:54:07,666
So that's it. Thank you so much for coming. We'll have some time for questions now

915
00:54:07,666 --> 00:54:20,195
Yeah, we have time for a few questions if you have a question come to the mic in the center aisle, please

916
00:54:20,195 --> 00:54:21,355
Come up to the mic

917
00:54:29,472 --> 00:54:30,413
Hey, how's it going?

918
00:54:30,413 --> 00:54:31,014
Hello.

919
00:54:31,014 --> 00:54:34,277
So this is generally more towards the music side of

920
00:54:34,277 --> 00:54:36,660
things, but it can definitely be used for both.

921
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:39,623
During your creative processes, I was curious if

922
00:54:39,623 --> 00:54:42,126
you find yourself getting into any patterns, and you're

923
00:54:42,126 --> 00:54:44,088
finding anything similar that you do in your ideas, and how

924
00:54:44,088 --> 00:54:44,808
you work around that.

925
00:54:47,637 --> 00:54:51,679
That's an interesting question. I think it's important to

926
00:54:51,679 --> 00:54:54,400
acknowledge patterns and kind of lean into the ones that you

927
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,022
like and kind of try to work your way out of the ones that

928
00:54:57,022 --> 00:55:00,163
you don't like. One of the things that I've always tried to

929
00:55:00,163 --> 00:55:03,745
do is to iterate on the creative process itself. So if I find

930
00:55:03,745 --> 00:55:07,127
that what I'm doing is stale, I'll try to go back to the

931
00:55:07,127 --> 00:55:11,049
drawing board and be like, you know, maybe I should change the

932
00:55:11,049 --> 00:55:12,089
actual way I'm writing. So.

933
00:55:12,590 --> 00:55:15,211
if I'm writing at the piano, maybe I'll write at the guitar.

934
00:55:15,211 --> 00:55:17,931
If I'm writing at the guitar, maybe I'll use flash cards like

935
00:55:17,931 --> 00:55:22,693
I did or I'll use, I like to build generative music tools. I

936
00:55:22,693 --> 00:55:26,934
try to have a lot of different options so that I can keep it

937
00:55:26,934 --> 00:55:30,835
fresh. Cool. All right. Thanks. Yeah, sure. Yeah. Hi. I was

938
00:55:30,835 --> 00:55:37,958
wondering, so with the shotgun you had nine separate sounds.

939
00:55:37,958 --> 00:55:40,518
What was your process? They were all different.

940
00:55:41,309 --> 00:55:44,112
I doubt you just randomly said hey here's nine sounds how does

941
00:55:44,112 --> 00:55:47,877
that sound. How did you make that? Why did you decide that?

942
00:55:47,877 --> 00:55:50,880
Good question. Basically how I decided for all the weapons

943
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:54,605
basically. Let's say it's a shotgun. I made sure to know

944
00:55:54,605 --> 00:55:57,388
that okay my seat is a shotgun so I'm going to have some sort

945
00:55:57,388 --> 00:56:00,612
of gun shot sort of layer in here at the very least. That's a

946
00:56:00,612 --> 00:56:01,393
good starting point.

947
00:56:01,753 --> 00:56:04,176
Then from there I know, okay, this is the diamond shotgun.

948
00:56:04,176 --> 00:56:06,439
I should make this sound really crystalline.

949
00:56:06,439 --> 00:56:08,882
What sorts of crystalline sounds can I get?

950
00:56:08,882 --> 00:56:11,105
Cool, okay, so I'm gonna start recording like me.

951
00:56:11,105 --> 00:56:13,308
I bought a belly dancer scarf for like a dollar

952
00:56:13,308 --> 00:56:16,412
off of Amazon, Amazon's the best, for a dollar

953
00:56:16,412 --> 00:56:18,094
and just shook it around and pitched it up.

954
00:56:18,094 --> 00:56:19,516
So okay, there's a crystalline sound.

955
00:56:19,857 --> 00:56:23,959
Now I want something that sounds kind of bassy and thuddy so it has some impact to it. What

956
00:56:23,959 --> 00:56:28,502
sort of bassy thud could I get? And then I kind of go from high, middle and low frequencies

957
00:56:28,502 --> 00:56:32,685
from there to see what I can fill out. That's usually how I approach this. Sometimes it

958
00:56:32,685 --> 00:56:37,849
is like I'm going to put a tiger growl in here and see if it sounds good. There's a

959
00:56:37,849 --> 00:56:41,531
lot of experimentation, especially when I'm stuck. But in general, I break things out

960
00:56:41,531 --> 00:56:45,874
into frequency spectrum, kind of a seed that I'm starting with and then go from there.

961
00:56:45,874 --> 00:56:46,394
Okay, thanks.

962
00:56:46,394 --> 00:56:46,575
Yeah.

963
00:56:48,370 --> 00:56:51,056
I have two questions now. With the shotgun you mentioned you

964
00:56:51,056 --> 00:56:56,788
want to use all the frequency. Is that mainly because it's a

965
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:57,830
weapon or do you?

966
00:56:58,781 --> 00:57:01,623
Do you want certain sounds to not occupy the whole range?

967
00:57:01,623 --> 00:57:04,485
Yeah, so for example, I don't want the footsteps to occupy the whole range,

968
00:57:04,485 --> 00:57:06,087
because that would drown out music.

969
00:57:06,087 --> 00:57:07,668
Unless it's like a giant monster.

970
00:57:07,668 --> 00:57:09,950
It's a huge monster or something very important.

971
00:57:09,950 --> 00:57:10,270
Right.

972
00:57:10,270 --> 00:57:12,792
So when it's something that I need to just sound like,

973
00:57:12,792 --> 00:57:15,394
oh, that's cool or that's impactful, I feel powerful,

974
00:57:15,394 --> 00:57:18,076
that's when I want to occupy not necessarily all,

975
00:57:18,076 --> 00:57:19,917
but a good chunk of them, especially bass.

976
00:57:19,977 --> 00:57:23,002
that's how I play with it. My question is in the project I'm

977
00:57:23,002 --> 00:57:27,911
working on I'm fighting music with my room tones or ambience

978
00:57:27,911 --> 00:57:30,996
like they kind of either don't go together like the music might

979
00:57:30,996 --> 00:57:33,501
be happy but you're in a cave and maybe that's just a bad way

980
00:57:33,501 --> 00:57:34,021
to do it.

981
00:57:34,610 --> 00:57:39,014
you guys use effects like stereoization to keep things

982
00:57:39,014 --> 00:57:43,998
separate? You have the bit crusher. For music and ambience

983
00:57:43,998 --> 00:57:47,000
I think part of the reason I pushed for doing ambience is I

984
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,023
knew it would be easier for us. It would take less time if I did

985
00:57:50,023 --> 00:57:54,166
both. When you're trying to make music and ambience fit together

986
00:57:55,167 --> 00:57:58,790
I think it's important to treat ambience like an element in the mix of your music.

987
00:57:58,790 --> 00:58:04,635
And so, you know, a thing that I tended to do with ambience is, like you said, you know,

988
00:58:04,635 --> 00:58:07,878
do stereo stuff where you push the ambience really wide.

989
00:58:07,878 --> 00:58:14,124
And also use, pretty much always would use high pass filter.

990
00:58:14,124 --> 00:58:14,244
Okay.

991
00:58:14,244 --> 00:58:15,104
Great.

992
00:58:15,104 --> 00:58:15,465
Thank you.

993
00:58:15,465 --> 00:58:16,446
You're welcome.

994
00:58:16,446 --> 00:58:16,766
Thanks.

995
00:58:18,756 --> 00:58:23,358
Hey, thanks. I wanted to start by, Rich, you had said earlier

996
00:58:23,358 --> 00:58:26,499
that you, I don't know if this was true of all of the

997
00:58:26,499 --> 00:58:30,261
soundtrack, but you were talking about creating a music system

998
00:58:30,261 --> 00:58:33,742
that would cycle through all of the different key signatures. So

my question is for Akash, in that case, when you're doing

1000
00:58:37,203 --> 00:58:40,405
musical sound effects, how do you make those not clash with a

1001
00:58:40,405 --> 00:58:41,805
constantly changing key signature?

1002
00:58:42,476 --> 00:58:47,399
remember asking you what keys to send. I don't know. Most of

1003
00:58:47,399 --> 00:58:50,842
the music is all over the place. Because it was all over the

1004
00:58:50,842 --> 00:58:54,585
place it never ‑‑ I think we decided why don't you do what

1005
00:58:54,585 --> 00:58:57,087
you're going to do and we'll listen and if it works it works.

1006
00:58:57,087 --> 00:59:00,830
I think ultimately that's the most important thing is using

1007
00:59:00,830 --> 00:59:04,433
your ears. If it did clash when we put it in I would have

1008
00:59:04,433 --> 00:59:08,917
changed it. But when it came in it sounded totally fine so we

1009
00:59:08,917 --> 00:59:10,438
just left it. That's how it works.

1010
00:59:11,348 --> 00:59:14,714
you so much for coming. I'll be wandering around. Same chat and

1011
00:59:14,714 --> 00:59:15,235
all that.
