1
00:00:06,522 --> 00:00:08,624
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:08,624 --> 00:00:09,004
Welcome.

3
00:00:09,004 --> 00:00:10,825
My name is Cole Hicks.

4
00:00:10,825 --> 00:00:12,887
I'm a composer and sound designer.

5
00:00:12,887 --> 00:00:15,549
And I'm Chris Hunt.

6
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:16,910
I'm the creator of Kenshi.

7
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:20,193
And this is Unscoring the World of Kenshi.

8
00:00:20,193 --> 00:00:22,855
We're going to be talking about the oral direction

9
00:00:22,855 --> 00:00:23,955
and what we decided to do.

10
00:00:23,955 --> 00:00:25,977
To explain a little bit about Kenshi,

11
00:00:25,977 --> 00:00:27,658
we actually have a video for you to watch first.

12
00:01:44,717 --> 00:01:44,880
you

13
00:02:25,746 --> 00:02:31,028
So that is a short video that explains Kenshi a little bit.

14
00:02:31,028 --> 00:02:33,888
But Chris, if you would like to explain a little bit more.

15
00:02:33,888 --> 00:02:36,709
Well, Kenshi is basically a sandbox RPG.

16
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:40,671
So at its core, it's all about freedom for the player.

17
00:02:40,671 --> 00:02:42,411
There's no story or grand quest.

18
00:02:42,411 --> 00:02:43,331
You're not the chosen one.

19
00:02:43,331 --> 00:02:45,352
You're not special in any way.

20
00:02:45,352 --> 00:02:47,653
So the whole game takes a nihilistic approach.

21
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,831
There's no Rat Street to practice on.

22
00:02:50,831 --> 00:02:53,892
Player characters don't get any advantage over NPCs.

23
00:02:53,892 --> 00:02:56,213
So I wanted to drill this into the player

24
00:02:56,213 --> 00:03:00,674
that you are not a hero, but kind of subliminally.

25
00:03:00,674 --> 00:03:09,258
So the music we decided is about the world, not the player.

26
00:03:09,258 --> 00:03:12,299
So it only cares about the trees and the mountains.

27
00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:14,600
You're not a hero and the game won't treat you like one.

28
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,581
So reflecting this in the music is...

29
00:03:17,438 --> 00:03:20,280
the best way decided to hammer this home.

30
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:20,480
Exactly.

31
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,763
So in this picture here, you'll see me and a fantastic cellist named Janess.

32
00:03:26,763 --> 00:03:28,444
We recorded down in LA.

33
00:03:28,444 --> 00:03:34,467
But what that means for me is I needed to create a system that represented the world

34
00:03:34,467 --> 00:03:35,308
and was indifferent.

35
00:03:35,868 --> 00:03:42,373
So I wanted to have an interactive music system that only reacted to input from the world.

36
00:03:42,373 --> 00:03:47,758
So based off of the time of day it was and what biome you're in,

37
00:03:47,758 --> 00:03:52,342
the only agency the player actually has is a music frequency slider

38
00:03:52,342 --> 00:03:54,063
and the options that they can control.

39
00:03:54,063 --> 00:03:57,106
So they can control how often they hear music.

40
00:03:57,106 --> 00:04:01,049
And that calls the engine and they'll play back.

41
00:04:01,921 --> 00:04:07,744
different combinations. I'll explain our exact system and how that works, but it varies in

42
00:04:07,744 --> 00:04:14,166
timbre, texture, and the mood based on what biome you're in and what time of day.

43
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:24,831
So, because the map is so huge, we divided it up into four main types of biome,

44
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:27,392
four classifications of music style.

45
00:04:28,131 --> 00:04:30,292
Five of you include the ones without any music at all.

46
00:04:30,292 --> 00:04:32,693
These were the ones that were intentionally

47
00:04:32,693 --> 00:04:33,833
designed to be lonely places.

48
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:39,875
The others reflect the main, the type of the biome,

49
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:42,696
apart from the Ashlands, which was a special case

50
00:04:42,696 --> 00:04:46,097
for the extra far away from civilization,

51
00:04:46,097 --> 00:04:50,479
dangerous, lots of death and treasure kind of areas.

52
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:51,119
Exactly, so.

53
00:04:52,448 --> 00:04:54,068
This is Jun Kuramoto.

54
00:04:54,068 --> 00:04:57,810
She's a Japanese koto player, also featured in this score.

55
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:01,911
And specifically, we hear the koto in the plains biome.

56
00:05:01,911 --> 00:05:04,212
But there are many different biomes.

57
00:05:04,212 --> 00:05:07,594
And there are some that just don't have music at all.

58
00:05:07,594 --> 00:05:09,874
Something you'll hear a lot throughout the talk

59
00:05:09,874 --> 00:05:12,675
is silence is utilized quite frequently.

60
00:05:12,675 --> 00:05:14,676
It's part of our style.

61
00:05:14,676 --> 00:05:15,697
And I think it helped.

62
00:05:16,573 --> 00:05:23,938
define our oral scape and give the players enough room to listen to what's going on in

63
00:05:23,938 --> 00:05:25,118
the world, enough breathing room.

64
00:05:25,118 --> 00:05:31,362
But the instrumentation, the colors and the mood all change on the biome and what time

65
00:05:31,362 --> 00:05:31,603
a day.

66
00:05:31,603 --> 00:05:37,947
So for example, the swamp, they have similar motivic material and you'll hear melodies

67
00:05:37,947 --> 00:05:40,448
approached in similar ways across all of the biomes.

68
00:05:40,448 --> 00:05:40,909
However,

69
00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:44,711
It'll be slide guitar, banjo, and jaw harp playing those,

70
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:46,732
whereas you go to the planes, and maybe it

71
00:05:46,732 --> 00:05:49,013
would be something different, like the koto.

72
00:05:49,013 --> 00:05:50,054
In addition to that.

73
00:05:51,239 --> 00:05:53,720
it's not only the instruments that change,

74
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,301
but how we play them.

75
00:05:55,301 --> 00:05:58,402
So during the daytime in the plains,

76
00:05:58,402 --> 00:05:59,142
we would have a cello,

77
00:05:59,142 --> 00:06:02,824
and it would be playing a little bit closer to the neck,

78
00:06:02,824 --> 00:06:04,904
and it'd be playing solpanto cello at night,

79
00:06:04,904 --> 00:06:08,566
so something a bit more haunting, hollow, and dark

80
00:06:08,566 --> 00:06:11,687
that makes sense for that biome in the time of day.

81
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:19,578
And this here is a general chart of our interactive music system

82
00:06:19,578 --> 00:06:22,602
that only reacts to world input.

83
00:06:22,602 --> 00:06:25,726
I'd like to start at the bottom here so we can talk about that.

84
00:06:25,726 --> 00:06:29,130
First and foremost, when you're in the game,

85
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:33,741
The player, the only thing they get to do is they set how frequently they want it.

86
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:37,723
It could trigger every minute, it could trigger every 30 minutes, I think we have it up to

87
00:06:37,723 --> 00:06:42,305
every hour because there are people that have thousands of hours in this game and maybe

88
00:06:42,305 --> 00:06:44,746
you don't want to hear it that often.

89
00:06:44,746 --> 00:06:45,067
But . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

90
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:52,745
We have the engine that calls to wise every minute or two or five or whatever the player

91
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:59,230
defines and I broke it down into multiple layers that all have random components in

92
00:06:59,230 --> 00:06:59,530
there.

93
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:01,571
So the drone layer, for example.

94
00:07:02,295 --> 00:07:07,319
has our tonal center, our mood information,

95
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:11,162
and is comprised of elements that exist

96
00:07:11,162 --> 00:07:13,164
in the other two layers as well.

97
00:07:13,164 --> 00:07:15,426
For example, the cello for the planes,

98
00:07:15,426 --> 00:07:18,328
what I ended up doing is took a sample of that,

99
00:07:18,328 --> 00:07:22,331
stretched it out, ended up adding some effects,

100
00:07:22,331 --> 00:07:24,673
brought it into iZotope's Iris,

101
00:07:24,673 --> 00:07:26,235
mapped it across the keyboard,

102
00:07:26,235 --> 00:07:28,336
and turned that into a pad that I could then play,

103
00:07:28,336 --> 00:07:31,399
and that ends up being part of the drone or ambient layer.

104
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:38,746
Then on top of that, we have the potential for another layer to exist, and this contains

105
00:07:38,746 --> 00:07:45,575
primarily harmonic information, so chord progressions, things like that, any kind of rhythms that

106
00:07:45,575 --> 00:07:46,837
are interesting or unique.

107
00:07:47,738 --> 00:07:53,120
And while the drone layer may be anywhere between 30 seconds to a couple minutes long,

108
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,162
the frame layer tends to be a bit shorter, anywhere between 15 seconds to a minute.

109
00:07:58,162 --> 00:08:03,704
And then on top of that, we have the possibility of having what I call the canopy layer.

110
00:08:03,704 --> 00:08:08,086
And that is our melodic information, the stuff that has the heart, the soul, and the emotion

111
00:08:08,086 --> 00:08:11,868
of what potentially is going on in the world.

112
00:08:11,868 --> 00:08:13,608
It's not representing exactly what's...

113
00:08:14,209 --> 00:08:15,790
going on with the players.

114
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,851
And one of my favorite stories is,

115
00:08:17,851 --> 00:08:20,433
I was reading on the forums,

116
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:23,695
and we have a pretty strong community for the game.

117
00:08:23,695 --> 00:08:27,338
And they created their base,

118
00:08:27,338 --> 00:08:29,940
and it was raided by a group of bandits.

119
00:08:30,948 --> 00:08:33,789
And they were able to dispatch them relatively easily,

120
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:35,450
but one of them was limping away.

121
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:39,171
In traditional combat music, if you were approaching it

122
00:08:39,171 --> 00:08:42,031
from a standard RPG, it might be a little bit more heroic,

123
00:08:42,031 --> 00:08:42,852
adventurous.

124
00:08:42,852 --> 00:08:46,573
It's like, congratulations, you're a badass, good job.

125
00:08:46,573 --> 00:08:48,733
But our music is a bit more ambient,

126
00:08:48,733 --> 00:08:51,474
and it felt lonely and dark and sad.

127
00:08:51,474 --> 00:08:53,734
And what ended up happening is something

128
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:56,495
that Bob Ross would call a happy accident.

129
00:08:57,055 --> 00:09:04,381
The player then associated this killing of the last bandit and thought to themselves,

130
00:09:04,381 --> 00:09:10,546
oh man, this guy was just trying to survive too, and I don't feel so good about this exactly.

131
00:09:10,546 --> 00:09:14,269
So then maybe you end up being a bit more pacifist throughout the game.

132
00:09:14,269 --> 00:09:16,430
Whether or not that's actually possible, I don't know.

133
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,672
It's a pretty dark and gritty world.

134
00:09:18,672 --> 00:09:21,214
But regardless, that was one of my favorite stories,

135
00:09:21,214 --> 00:09:25,377
and this kind of system allowed for those happy accidents to happen.

136
00:09:25,978 --> 00:09:28,062
If I approached it in a traditional sense,

137
00:09:28,062 --> 00:09:30,366
we wouldn't have had something like that,

138
00:09:30,366 --> 00:09:31,107
and it couldn't exist.

139
00:09:31,107 --> 00:09:33,151
And we have an example here that I'd

140
00:09:33,151 --> 00:09:34,975
like to play for you guys of our music.

141
00:09:51,649 --> 00:10:01,014
So that's just the frame layer.

142
00:10:01,014 --> 00:10:04,716
Now we change biome and night.

143
00:10:04,716 --> 00:10:12,640
Frame and canopy on top of each other.

144
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,611
Night again, but for Swamplands.

145
00:10:21,611 --> 00:10:27,852
Again, Fragment Canopy.

146
00:10:27,852 --> 00:10:37,734
Date time for the Tar Sands.

147
00:10:37,734 --> 00:10:42,595
Interestingly enough, there's a possibility that it triggers silence

148
00:10:42,595 --> 00:10:45,536
across all three layers, which is nice.

149
00:10:45,536 --> 00:10:47,496
And I have to re-trigger it again, so we get...

150
00:10:59,847 --> 00:11:06,993
And that contained all three layers, our drone, our frame,

151
00:11:06,993 --> 00:11:10,295
and our canopy, all combined together.

152
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:12,497
Escape from that.

153
00:11:12,497 --> 00:11:12,877
Going back.

154
00:11:12,877 --> 00:11:22,985
So one other important point was the anti-Hollywood sound.

155
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:28,975
This was for the same reasons as everything else, it was to avoid glorifying the player.

156
00:11:28,975 --> 00:11:33,280
Combat at the end of the day is just a bunch of guys wailing on each other with bits of metal, so...

157
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:38,185
I wanted more of a dull thwack sound rather than cinematic chings.

158
00:11:39,858 --> 00:11:46,564
Exactly, so what I ended up having to do from that information is figure out a way of approaching

159
00:11:46,564 --> 00:11:51,408
the sound design and the VO and the music and having it all really mixed together.

160
00:11:51,408 --> 00:11:55,992
Something I just thought of today as I was putting the talk together over the past couple

161
00:11:55,992 --> 00:11:59,875
months or so is it kind of reminds me a bit of pointillism.

162
00:12:00,115 --> 00:12:03,737
where we're not necessarily focusing on the very tiny details,

163
00:12:03,737 --> 00:12:05,318
but all these little dots add up,

164
00:12:05,318 --> 00:12:09,521
and as you move back, you can start to see a bit more clear picture.

165
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:13,363
And that's kind of how I like to think of the audio for Kenshi,

166
00:12:13,363 --> 00:12:16,465
is it's all these tiny little bits and pieces

167
00:12:16,465 --> 00:12:18,226
that all fit together relatively well

168
00:12:18,226 --> 00:12:21,427
and are mixed somewhat evenly and treated evenly.

169
00:12:22,328 --> 00:12:27,874
So, for example, we don't have the ginormous thwacks and impacts that you would expect

170
00:12:27,874 --> 00:12:33,420
in traditional sound design from big, heavy action games.

171
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,324
No whooshes, and it's not super realistic.

172
00:12:36,324 --> 00:12:42,030
We still wanted to make sure that it was engaging, but it wasn't necessarily over the top either.

173
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:46,991
And another thing that I mentioned prior is silence is good.

174
00:12:46,991 --> 00:12:48,311
We used silence a lot.

175
00:12:48,311 --> 00:12:54,192
It's okay if you don't hear a lot of sounds throughout a decent portion of the game because

176
00:12:54,192 --> 00:12:58,173
a lot of these players, it's not just a quick pick up and play for 20 minutes.

177
00:12:58,173 --> 00:13:02,674
It's usually I'm going to sit down and play a session for three or four hours and many

178
00:13:02,674 --> 00:13:06,955
players have hundreds of hours, a couple even thousands of hours into the game already.

179
00:13:06,955 --> 00:13:09,536
So silence helps them.

180
00:13:10,096 --> 00:13:13,699
kind of deal with all of the game that they've been playing.

181
00:13:13,699 --> 00:13:15,740
And one of my favorite compliments

182
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,982
that I think I've ever received specifically

183
00:13:17,982 --> 00:13:20,604
from this game in the forums is there's lots of players

184
00:13:20,604 --> 00:13:24,587
that said this is the first game or one of the first games

185
00:13:24,587 --> 00:13:27,349
where they didn't automatically turn the sound off

186
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:28,570
and listen to their own music.

187
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:31,992
And I think that's in part because we didn't inundate them

188
00:13:31,992 --> 00:13:33,653
with sound and music.

189
00:13:33,653 --> 00:13:37,376
It was more ambient in our approach

190
00:13:37,376 --> 00:13:39,558
and just giving them information that they needed.

191
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:48,187
So one other little challenge we had was the orbital camera.

192
00:13:48,187 --> 00:13:50,608
It can zoom and rotate pretty far.

193
00:13:50,608 --> 00:13:52,670
So instead of having the listener on the player, like

194
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:55,712
in a first-person game, we had to keep an appropriate

195
00:13:55,712 --> 00:14:00,455
ambience to keep in line with the camera movements.

196
00:14:00,455 --> 00:14:02,997
So mostly we based this on the camera

197
00:14:02,997 --> 00:14:05,139
altitude from the terrain.

198
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:11,031
And what that means for me is I needed to create an ambient

199
00:14:11,031 --> 00:14:15,112
environment system in Wwise that took into consideration

200
00:14:15,112 --> 00:14:16,832
our mobile camera.

201
00:14:16,832 --> 00:14:21,153
And when you're completely zoomed in, for example, let's

202
00:14:21,153 --> 00:14:22,633
pick the jungle biome.

203
00:14:22,633 --> 00:14:25,234
If we're in there and you're listening to it, you should be

204
00:14:25,234 --> 00:14:29,835
able to hear a general loop that contains information on

205
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:33,536
some twigs maybe breaking over there, maybe some insects,

206
00:14:33,536 --> 00:14:34,696
birds.

207
00:14:34,996 --> 00:14:37,878
a general loop that exists in that world, relatively dry,

208
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:40,539
and that's part of our system.

209
00:14:40,539 --> 00:14:44,282
I use blend containers, then, to, as you pull back and zoom

210
00:14:44,282 --> 00:14:50,025
out, that loop I brought into Pro Tools, added a lot of reverb,

211
00:14:50,025 --> 00:14:52,626
made it a bit more wet that was appropriate for the bio mode

212
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:56,169
it existed in, and then add a low-pass filter,

213
00:14:56,169 --> 00:14:58,630
slightly pitched it down, and made the stereo field,

214
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,871
as this chart shows, a bit more narrow.

215
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:05,846
So what ends up happening there is as you pull out,

216
00:15:05,846 --> 00:15:09,126
the stereo field for the primary ambient loop

217
00:15:09,126 --> 00:15:10,427
gets a bit more narrow.

218
00:15:10,427 --> 00:15:13,007
The wind sounds and other weather sounds come up,

219
00:15:13,007 --> 00:15:16,148
but they still stay far-panned left and right.

220
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:17,889
So it feels a bit more serene, and you're

221
00:15:17,889 --> 00:15:19,169
getting wind sounds there.

222
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:21,109
When you zoom back down into the world,

223
00:15:21,109 --> 00:15:24,070
it fills out entirely so you can hear or feel

224
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:26,711
as if you have just dove right into the biome,

225
00:15:26,711 --> 00:15:27,751
and the wind comes down a bit.

226
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:33,728
Beyond that, though, we have an interesting randomized creature

227
00:15:33,728 --> 00:15:34,732
vocalization system.

228
00:15:36,007 --> 00:15:41,090
Rather than picking a tree that randomly exists in the world and saying, all right, we're

229
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:47,293
going to attach an emitter to that that says there's going to be a type of bird that would

230
00:15:47,293 --> 00:15:51,616
sing there all the time, and maybe it would change off of day or night.

231
00:15:51,616 --> 00:15:57,419
Instead, what I decided to do was go with user-defined positioning for the sounds.

232
00:15:57,419 --> 00:15:59,280
So if you have a 3D sound, whether it be...

233
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:05,344
a sound, a container of any kind, you can define how it's being played back.

234
00:16:05,344 --> 00:16:11,427
And I decided that we had a random container that's biome and time of day specific, so

235
00:16:11,427 --> 00:16:15,669
you have a whole bunch of different creatures that could only exist in the jungle at night.

236
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:22,391
And it will constantly play that as a loop with the volume randomized, the pitch randomized,

237
00:16:22,391 --> 00:16:24,592
and low-pass slightly randomized.

238
00:16:24,592 --> 00:16:28,253
In that container, I have baked in reverb to a lot of the different sound files.

239
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:33,234
And on top of that, the user-defined, what that means is we have our listener there.

240
00:16:33,234 --> 00:16:37,775
And then I've picked random locations around the listener for these sounds to spawn.

241
00:16:37,775 --> 00:16:39,275
Some of them have movement as well.

242
00:16:39,275 --> 00:16:41,036
That's what the little blue squigglies are.

243
00:16:41,976 --> 00:16:49,063
So what you end up getting when you are completely zoomed in is this more fully fleshed out ambience

244
00:16:49,063 --> 00:16:52,746
that isn't necessarily tied to anything specific.

245
00:16:52,746 --> 00:16:58,131
We do have emitters in the world that exist too that you can visually see and interact

246
00:16:58,131 --> 00:16:58,752
with.

247
00:16:58,752 --> 00:17:00,934
But this is just to fill out the entire system.

248
00:17:00,934 --> 00:17:03,536
And I have a video for you guys to watch right now.

249
00:18:38,453 --> 00:18:38,693
Thank you.

250
00:18:55,184 --> 00:18:58,427
And the building integrity is we pick a value from 0 to 100,

251
00:18:58,427 --> 00:19:00,708
0 being it's about to fall apart, to 100,

252
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,009
it's doing pretty well.

253
00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:05,652
And then that has even more randomized sounds

254
00:19:05,652 --> 00:19:07,854
that exist in that world.

255
00:19:07,854 --> 00:19:09,875
So we have wood creaking.

256
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:12,197
If you're in a metal building, it sounds different.

257
00:19:12,197 --> 00:19:13,098
Stone's different.

258
00:19:13,098 --> 00:19:14,699
Maybe there's some rats scurrying around.

259
00:19:14,699 --> 00:19:16,120
There's flies, too.

260
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,221
That's all part of it.

261
00:19:17,221 --> 00:19:17,281
So.

262
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:23,742
Audio dialogue was something we avoided altogether.

263
00:19:23,742 --> 00:19:26,545
Due to the sheer size of the game and the amount of text dialogue we had,

264
00:19:26,545 --> 00:19:28,426
there was no way to keep up with it.

265
00:19:28,426 --> 00:19:30,608
And I really wanted to avoid arrow to the knee syndrome.

266
00:19:30,608 --> 00:19:35,192
Constant speech repetition in characters is one of the first things

267
00:19:35,192 --> 00:19:36,973
to break believability for me.

268
00:19:36,973 --> 00:19:38,894
And we had a small budget and a big game,

269
00:19:38,894 --> 00:19:41,717
so I thought it was better to leave it out than to do it badly.

270
00:19:41,717 --> 00:19:47,922
And something important for me and Chris

271
00:19:47,922 --> 00:19:49,143
was to then have...

272
00:19:51,007 --> 00:19:53,529
each vocal timbre be easily identifiable.

273
00:19:53,529 --> 00:19:56,811
So the hive people sound different than the skeleton

274
00:19:56,811 --> 00:19:58,872
or the robot race you see over there,

275
00:19:58,872 --> 00:20:00,093
sound different than the human,

276
00:20:00,093 --> 00:20:01,274
sound different than the shek.

277
00:20:01,274 --> 00:20:07,698
And the role of VO and kinshi is more akin to sound effects,

278
00:20:07,698 --> 00:20:12,100
where it's enhancing and justifying certain player actions.

279
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:15,322
So during combat, you may have reaction hits

280
00:20:15,322 --> 00:20:16,543
or anticipations.

281
00:20:18,344 --> 00:20:20,905
certain actions justify vocalizations as well.

282
00:20:20,905 --> 00:20:22,586
And there are some idle sounds too.

283
00:20:22,586 --> 00:20:23,867
So if you're in the bar or the tavern,

284
00:20:23,867 --> 00:20:26,008
there will be some sounds playing there.

285
00:20:26,008 --> 00:20:29,730
But we don't have a lot of dialogue or monologue

286
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:34,232
for the reason that Chris mentioned,

287
00:20:34,232 --> 00:20:36,153
plus localization issues too.

288
00:20:36,153 --> 00:20:38,274
And I have a video to kind of demonstrate

289
00:20:38,274 --> 00:20:41,175
the skeleton race, the robot over there,

290
00:20:41,175 --> 00:20:41,955
what that sounds like.

291
00:20:41,955 --> 00:20:44,477
And then I'll go through my process for that.

292
00:20:49,265 --> 00:21:06,750
So that last one was them getting hit, the robot or skeleton race.

293
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:13,292
And that was interesting because I had to think of it a little bit backwards.

294
00:21:14,468 --> 00:21:18,709
where the second step you can see is to reverse the phrase that I recorded.

295
00:21:18,709 --> 00:21:24,291
So if I wanted ow to happen, and usually we'd say ow, and it descends,

296
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:28,172
then I would have to think wah, and it ascending in pitch.

297
00:21:28,172 --> 00:21:30,312
Of course, as you reverse, it's going to sound a little funky.

298
00:21:30,312 --> 00:21:31,712
It's not going to be perfect.

299
00:21:31,712 --> 00:21:35,973
But it ended up working for a race like the skeletons here.

300
00:21:35,973 --> 00:21:40,234
But I recorded phrases, reversed them, then EQed it a bit,

301
00:21:40,234 --> 00:21:43,355
taking a bit off the top and the bottom, and adding around 2 to 3k.

302
00:21:44,655 --> 00:21:49,397
compressed it, and something that was really important to Chris is to have it sound like

303
00:21:49,397 --> 00:21:54,820
these guys have this old, beat up, dusty speaker that they speak from.

304
00:21:54,820 --> 00:22:00,862
So, MicDSP makes a plug-in called Futzbox, and we picked the antique speaker,

305
00:22:00,862 --> 00:22:05,404
tweaked it a little bit, added a little bit of distortion, EQ'd it slightly,

306
00:22:05,404 --> 00:22:09,206
and that ended up giving us the sound of our robot race, of the skeletons.

307
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:14,739
Now I have a video as well that kind of sums this all up together and you'll be able to

308
00:22:14,739 --> 00:22:17,301
hear samples throughout the game.

309
00:22:17,301 --> 00:22:19,862
One thing I do want to point out is the combat.

310
00:22:19,862 --> 00:22:25,306
I specifically took out the VO and the footsteps and some of the other sounds that exist in

311
00:22:25,306 --> 00:22:31,170
there so that you can focus purely on the whoosh and the impact and keeping in mind

312
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:34,012
our idea of the anti-Hollywood sound.

313
00:23:31,552 --> 00:23:31,615
Bye.

314
00:23:31,615 --> 00:23:31,678
Bye.

315
00:23:31,678 --> 00:23:31,741
Bye.

316
00:23:31,741 --> 00:23:31,847
Bye.

317
00:23:31,847 --> 00:23:31,952
Bye.

318
00:23:57,275 --> 00:23:58,797
So that's a little sample video.

319
00:23:58,797 --> 00:24:00,838
One thing I did want to point out about that

320
00:24:00,838 --> 00:24:04,021
is the last three samples were completely

321
00:24:04,021 --> 00:24:06,643
taken at different times, but they were all in the same biome.

322
00:24:06,643 --> 00:24:09,905
So that's why it sounded like the music fit relatively

323
00:24:09,905 --> 00:24:12,007
well in between each example, as they

324
00:24:12,007 --> 00:24:14,929
had the same tonal center, the same tempo,

325
00:24:14,929 --> 00:24:17,311
and a lot of the same instrumentation,

326
00:24:17,311 --> 00:24:18,432
considering it was daytime there.

327
00:24:19,431 --> 00:24:21,553
So that is our talk.

328
00:24:21,553 --> 00:24:24,716
Some final thoughts just to sum it all up.

329
00:24:24,716 --> 00:24:27,879
For me personally, it was important to create

330
00:24:27,879 --> 00:24:32,903
a aural scape that represents the indifference

331
00:24:32,903 --> 00:24:33,944
of the world of Kenshi.

332
00:24:33,944 --> 00:24:36,706
So that means making a music system that's

333
00:24:36,706 --> 00:24:40,530
self-generated from all the different variables and layers

334
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:42,091
that I've given it.

335
00:24:42,091 --> 00:24:45,875
It's a bit more ambient, and it only reacts to world input.

336
00:24:47,715 --> 00:24:53,200
Then sound, it's important that that plays a role where it just fits into the picture

337
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,584
and it's not super Hollywood or bombastic in style.

338
00:24:57,584 --> 00:25:01,268
And lastly, silence was very important to our style.

339
00:25:01,268 --> 00:25:06,853
Yeah, I'm happy with the result and I think when you put it all together, the anti-Hollywood

340
00:25:06,853 --> 00:25:12,999
sound, the silence, it makes, gives you a nice depressing, lonely feeling and I like

341
00:25:12,999 --> 00:25:13,079
it.

342
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:16,394
Which it works well for Genji.

343
00:25:16,394 --> 00:25:17,774
But that's our talk.

344
00:25:17,774 --> 00:25:20,676
Thank you very much for attending.

345
00:25:20,676 --> 00:25:23,978
Fill out your surveys and ask us anything.

346
00:25:23,978 --> 00:25:25,999
Please come up, say hi as well.

347
00:25:25,999 --> 00:25:26,320
Thank you.

348
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:33,424
And if you do have questions, please

349
00:25:33,424 --> 00:25:36,145
feel free to stand up to the mic.

350
00:25:36,145 --> 00:25:38,007
They told me to ask you.

351
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:44,536
Hey, John.

352
00:25:44,536 --> 00:25:45,437
Hello, sir.

353
00:25:45,437 --> 00:25:47,039
Question.

354
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:51,063
In crafting the score, how many real instruments versus

355
00:25:51,063 --> 00:25:54,347
samples versus, could you give us a breakdown of your

356
00:25:54,347 --> 00:25:55,829
orchestration, basically?

357
00:25:55,829 --> 00:25:56,329
Sure, sure.

358
00:25:56,329 --> 00:25:57,150
Absolutely.

359
00:25:57,150 --> 00:26:01,915
So I prefer to use as many live musicians as I possibly

360
00:26:01,915 --> 00:26:03,958
can, even if I am going to.

361
00:26:04,979 --> 00:26:09,684
put it in a music system that randomly decides when it plays back.

362
00:26:09,684 --> 00:26:14,589
So I would say a decent amount of our score, and Chris was on board for this the whole

363
00:26:14,589 --> 00:26:19,895
time which is wonderful, and we ended up working with a lot of live instruments.

364
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:27,553
The foundation or bass layer, the drone, that was like a mix of Omnisphere and me tinkering

365
00:26:27,553 --> 00:26:31,734
around in Iris and other things to create those sounds.

366
00:26:31,734 --> 00:26:36,916
But a lot of the frame layer and the canopy, those were all just live recorded and then

367
00:26:36,916 --> 00:26:39,137
I would mix and master and add some reverb to it.

368
00:26:39,137 --> 00:26:44,139
So I'd say a good 80% of the score is all live.

369
00:26:50,474 --> 00:26:53,877
Alright, well thank you guys very much for attending and please come up, say hi, and

370
00:26:53,877 --> 00:26:56,599
if you have any questions later, let us know.

371
00:26:56,599 --> 00:26:57,060
Thank you.
