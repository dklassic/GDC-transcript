1
00:00:05,972 --> 00:00:06,832
Thank you, awesome.

2
00:00:07,953 --> 00:00:08,954
Hi, my name's John Linvey.

3
00:00:09,494 --> 00:00:11,576
I am the community manager at Red Hook Studios,

4
00:00:12,236 --> 00:00:14,798
and we make a game called Darkest Dungeon.

5
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:18,181
I'm here today to discuss the following.

6
00:00:20,543 --> 00:00:22,484
How to be a community camp counselor.

7
00:00:24,586 --> 00:00:26,967
How we position ourselves relative to our players.

8
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:31,331
Why it's important to build a structural framework

9
00:00:31,411 --> 00:00:32,992
of discourse within the community.

10
00:00:34,922 --> 00:00:37,163
giving your community opportunities to give back

11
00:00:37,403 --> 00:00:38,764
and celebrating those contributions,

12
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,706
knowing the cohorts that comprise your community,

13
00:00:46,148 --> 00:00:48,829
taking the time to understand how to effectively communicate

14
00:00:48,969 --> 00:00:50,991
to all of your audiences,

15
00:00:53,392 --> 00:00:55,033
and to give players the means to continue

16
00:00:55,053 --> 00:00:57,834
the relationship that they establish.

17
00:00:59,515 --> 00:01:01,696
So what does it mean to be a community camp counselor?

18
00:01:03,279 --> 00:01:05,441
I would like to start by saying that I don't

19
00:01:05,761 --> 00:01:07,583
particularly like the title community manager.

20
00:01:08,723 --> 00:01:10,845
It has always felt somewhat disingenuous to me

21
00:01:11,506 --> 00:01:13,908
when I've described myself as a manager of our community.

22
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,492
First, no one likes to be managed,

23
00:01:19,052 --> 00:01:21,153
especially not when that person is a total stranger,

24
00:01:21,273 --> 00:01:21,733
which is me.

25
00:01:22,673 --> 00:01:24,334
More importantly, this kind of distinction

26
00:01:24,914 --> 00:01:27,015
puts a false dynamic, power dynamic,

27
00:01:27,035 --> 00:01:29,196
between us as developers and our players.

28
00:01:30,396 --> 00:01:33,097
It also frames it as if the developers are up above them,

29
00:01:33,457 --> 00:01:35,718
and my job is sort of to come down from the mountaintop

30
00:01:36,258 --> 00:01:37,319
and say, this is how,

31
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,259
this is the gospel of Darkest Dungeon.

32
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,522
So right off the bat I feel like that sets off a poor understanding of my relationship with our players.

33
00:01:45,042 --> 00:01:49,225
I'm not really here to manage them in a traditional sense of the word.

34
00:01:50,706 --> 00:01:54,588
I've found myself spending more time researching how to ask the right questions

35
00:01:55,028 --> 00:01:56,709
or how to clearly explain our game

36
00:01:57,189 --> 00:02:00,611
than actually trying to manage anyone that participates with us.

37
00:02:03,684 --> 00:02:05,405
And this is why I like to refer to myself

38
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:06,905
as a camp counselor.

39
00:02:07,466 --> 00:02:10,247
My job is to encourage and maintain a healthy dialogue

40
00:02:10,327 --> 00:02:12,948
amongst and between our players and then to our team.

41
00:02:14,148 --> 00:02:16,469
Instead of that like top-down hierarchy,

42
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,111
we like to envision it as more of like a horizontal,

43
00:02:20,131 --> 00:02:21,291
we're all sitting around a table

44
00:02:21,371 --> 00:02:22,732
passing information back and forth.

45
00:02:24,052 --> 00:02:25,353
And this dialogue works best

46
00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:28,954
when we're able to make our intentions well-defined.

47
00:02:31,477 --> 00:02:34,681
And I cannot stress the well-defined part of that sentence enough.

48
00:02:35,763 --> 00:02:39,968
It's an important distinction to make because there's still a really wide gap

49
00:02:40,128 --> 00:02:45,215
between players and creators in terms of how players understand how games are made.

50
00:02:45,876 --> 00:02:48,619
And I feel this is the source of most friction within communities.

51
00:02:50,411 --> 00:02:55,736
I don't necessarily think that players should know how games are made, but if we can just

52
00:02:55,796 --> 00:03:01,562
bring them in a little closer to help them understand the why or how behind certain design

53
00:03:01,702 --> 00:03:07,007
or creative decisions, we can give them the vernacular to clearly articulate what is or

54
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:12,312
is not working in relation to our intent and expectations with design, mechanics, and features.

55
00:03:15,008 --> 00:03:16,729
And that's what I mean about a camp counselor

56
00:03:17,309 --> 00:03:17,929
over a manager.

57
00:03:18,749 --> 00:03:20,750
Having a little bit of understanding of human behavior

58
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,591
can help your day-to-day as you can quickly identify

59
00:03:23,711 --> 00:03:25,391
issues with messaging or timing

60
00:03:25,931 --> 00:03:27,772
and be able to react more appropriately

61
00:03:27,812 --> 00:03:30,552
rather than trying to control fires, so to speak.

62
00:03:34,593 --> 00:03:36,874
So this is how we position ourselves relative to our player.

63
00:03:38,387 --> 00:03:41,609
I think we as game developers need to remember a key thing,

64
00:03:41,649 --> 00:03:43,150
and that all game communities start

65
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:45,111
from a really amazing and beautiful spot.

66
00:03:46,071 --> 00:03:50,054
Both the players and the developers love their game.

67
00:03:50,994 --> 00:03:52,575
Sometimes they love it so much,

68
00:03:52,736 --> 00:03:55,597
they want to tear it all down and build it all over again.

69
00:03:57,078 --> 00:03:59,360
And sometimes it takes 400 hours to realize

70
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,700
that you can't recommend a game,

71
00:04:01,161 --> 00:04:03,082
and you know, that's okay.

72
00:04:03,682 --> 00:04:04,183
That happens.

73
00:04:06,807 --> 00:04:09,508
Regardless, that is the origin of our relationship

74
00:04:09,688 --> 00:04:10,328
with our community.

75
00:04:10,868 --> 00:04:13,008
The key difference is that, as a studio,

76
00:04:13,088 --> 00:04:14,829
we are making the game that we want to make,

77
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:18,109
and that sometimes does not always agree

78
00:04:18,409 --> 00:04:19,830
with the version of the game

79
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,710
that our players want us to make.

80
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,631
A good friend of mine, Trent Custers and Lisey Kane

81
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:28,411
from League of Geeks, who make a game called Armello,

82
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:32,692
gave me, and they also have an amazing community,

83
00:04:32,952 --> 00:04:34,152
they gave me a great piece of advice.

84
00:04:35,778 --> 00:04:38,840
They said, we carefully use language like,

85
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,341
help us make the game we're aiming for,

86
00:04:41,361 --> 00:04:46,684
as opposed to help us make the best game we can.

87
00:04:48,045 --> 00:04:50,786
One explicitly states that they are here to assist us

88
00:04:50,946 --> 00:04:53,688
in the task, and that they are not subject,

89
00:04:55,048 --> 00:04:56,089
they're here to help us in a task

90
00:04:56,109 --> 00:04:58,250
that is not to their discretion, but ours.

91
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,251
The other gives a false representation

92
00:05:00,331 --> 00:05:02,192
of the player-developer relationship.

93
00:05:04,564 --> 00:05:06,245
So this is like super critical,

94
00:05:06,425 --> 00:05:08,085
and if you take anything away from this talk

95
00:05:08,145 --> 00:05:10,306
is that this small change in language between

96
00:05:11,967 --> 00:05:14,348
our community helps us make the best version of our,

97
00:05:14,728 --> 00:05:15,768
the best version of the game,

98
00:05:16,969 --> 00:05:22,171
to our community helps us make our game better,

99
00:05:22,191 --> 00:05:24,952
that is like the biggest gulf

100
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:27,353
and like the most important thing ever in your messaging

101
00:05:27,793 --> 00:05:29,114
throughout all of the things that you do

102
00:05:29,174 --> 00:05:29,854
as a community manager.

103
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,581
This better frames the real relationship

104
00:05:33,761 --> 00:05:36,802
between the players and properly sets expectations.

105
00:05:37,543 --> 00:05:39,423
Especially if you say this on repetition,

106
00:05:39,443 --> 00:05:40,144
like I said before.

107
00:05:40,884 --> 00:05:43,105
And through our interactions, we equip them,

108
00:05:43,985 --> 00:05:46,206
we equip the community to ensure they have everything

109
00:05:46,326 --> 00:05:49,127
they need to help us make our game.

110
00:05:50,268 --> 00:05:52,489
Now, this isn't meant to discredit our players.

111
00:05:53,329 --> 00:05:54,770
Rather, it ensures that the relationship

112
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:56,030
doesn't become abusive.

113
00:05:57,309 --> 00:05:58,950
Players should never have us hostage

114
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,932
when we're trying to implement changes

115
00:06:00,972 --> 00:06:02,453
or make important design decisions,

116
00:06:03,473 --> 00:06:06,135
but we should give them the tools and framework

117
00:06:06,555 --> 00:06:09,217
to help us properly identify the problem

118
00:06:09,697 --> 00:06:12,539
and not just have them offer us their solutions.

119
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,641
Players are really good

120
00:06:16,102 --> 00:06:17,783
at offering their solutions to problems,

121
00:06:18,523 --> 00:06:20,605
but they're not always the best

122
00:06:20,985 --> 00:06:23,667
at properly identifying what the root problem is.

123
00:06:24,713 --> 00:06:28,014
Again, this is an issue of poor framing on our part

124
00:06:28,094 --> 00:06:30,675
as developers to elicit better player feedback.

125
00:06:31,296 --> 00:06:33,377
And it's our job as community managers

126
00:06:33,417 --> 00:06:34,657
or people who work within the community

127
00:06:35,117 --> 00:06:38,199
to give them the tools to dig deeper into these areas

128
00:06:38,299 --> 00:06:40,220
and map out the entirety of a problem

129
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,321
before we can begin discussing the solutions.

130
00:06:45,402 --> 00:06:46,943
And that's what I mean by why it's important

131
00:06:46,963 --> 00:06:48,043
to build a structural framework

132
00:06:48,803 --> 00:06:50,084
for discourse within the community.

133
00:06:52,851 --> 00:06:54,653
A solid example of why I spend more time

134
00:06:54,733 --> 00:06:56,074
learning how to frame a question

135
00:06:56,154 --> 00:06:58,476
goes to a common thread we saw in our community.

136
00:06:59,117 --> 00:07:00,638
The thread typically reads like,

137
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,081
X character is garbage and should be buffed,

138
00:07:04,101 --> 00:07:05,262
or this skill is worthless

139
00:07:05,322 --> 00:07:06,223
and we should do something better.

140
00:07:07,684 --> 00:07:11,527
The conversation would then begin with how they feel about a character as bad.

141
00:07:12,268 --> 00:07:15,690
They would then begin to offer solutions for the problem, or how to fix the problem.

142
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:20,513
And sometimes the discussion would be something like, write the characters in order from best

143
00:07:20,553 --> 00:07:24,436
to worst, and then it would be followed with even more solutions for those unlucky few

144
00:07:24,456 --> 00:07:25,696
people who landed at the bottom.

145
00:07:27,411 --> 00:07:32,172
When I saw these threads, I remembered a really great conversation I had with a designer, David Serlin.

146
00:07:32,933 --> 00:07:37,434
I respect him a lot. He works on a lot of competitive multiplayer games and game balance.

147
00:07:37,794 --> 00:07:39,915
If you haven't heard of him, please look him up. He's super smart.

148
00:07:41,215 --> 00:07:44,016
And he mentioned that lists like this are generally pretty useless,

149
00:07:44,836 --> 00:07:48,297
as they don't actually tell the designers as much as players think they do.

150
00:07:49,297 --> 00:07:53,058
Primarily, it doesn't really account for the gaps between each of the numbers.

151
00:07:57,314 --> 00:08:01,163
I also took issue with the discussion as it was narrowly focused on a character's power

152
00:08:01,244 --> 00:08:05,615
in combat, but not the overall utility in our game.

153
00:08:07,101 --> 00:08:11,044
I make this distinction between utility and power as in our game classes bring more to

154
00:08:11,064 --> 00:08:15,868
a fight rather than just raw stats of damage or things like that.

155
00:08:16,448 --> 00:08:20,892
And they can be even more useful in other areas of the game that exist outside of that

156
00:08:20,952 --> 00:08:21,633
combat system.

157
00:08:22,173 --> 00:08:27,698
And I wanted to make sure that our players were thinking more holistically about a character

158
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:31,681
rather than the narrow lens of how useful they are strictly in combat.

159
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,852
So for example, the leper might be a one,

160
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,354
the jester might be a two, and the crusader a three.

161
00:08:39,455 --> 00:08:42,117
So the value between the jester and the crusader

162
00:08:42,597 --> 00:08:46,440
looks as just one, but the actual power utility difference

163
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,703
is maybe a five, but the ranking order system

164
00:08:49,723 --> 00:08:51,304
doesn't allow for that level of nuance,

165
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,205
and we don't really get a lot of useful information

166
00:08:53,225 --> 00:08:55,367
from this because we're not accounting for that gap.

167
00:08:57,655 --> 00:09:00,277
Because yeah, it reads like one, two, and three,

168
00:09:00,357 --> 00:09:01,118
regardless of where they are.

169
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:03,560
This is why you often see tier lists

170
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,021
used in fighting games, right?

171
00:09:05,761 --> 00:09:07,143
So we structured a community discussion

172
00:09:07,163 --> 00:09:10,325
to not place the characters in a ranked list,

173
00:09:10,905 --> 00:09:12,527
but rather to group them in a set of tiers,

174
00:09:12,547 --> 00:09:13,888
A through D, as an example.

175
00:09:14,749 --> 00:09:17,791
A being they display their utility in all circumstances,

176
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,153
require little or no extra effort to make useful.

177
00:09:21,174 --> 00:09:25,337
B, meaning some need some special care, but generally are pretty useful in all cases.

178
00:09:25,957 --> 00:09:30,201
And so on down to D, where it meant that you would never recommend bringing these to new

179
00:09:30,241 --> 00:09:34,845
players at all, and they required too many specific circumstances to be actually useful

180
00:09:34,885 --> 00:09:35,405
or reliable.

181
00:09:37,993 --> 00:09:41,515
After the players did all that, I then collated all that data

182
00:09:41,535 --> 00:09:43,556
and presented it back to them.

183
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:45,637
So this took some time to do the survey,

184
00:09:45,697 --> 00:09:46,958
like say, hey, submit us your data,

185
00:09:46,978 --> 00:09:49,600
and then I put it all together in a table.

186
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:53,302
Showing where everyone fell on the list, on the tier list,

187
00:09:53,782 --> 00:09:55,883
as well as showing the delta for each class individually

188
00:09:55,923 --> 00:09:57,204
so we could see sort of how the points

189
00:09:57,284 --> 00:09:58,304
clustered across the array.

190
00:09:59,605 --> 00:10:00,366
From that discussion,

191
00:10:01,764 --> 00:10:05,205
From that, we were able to finally begin having the discussion that we wanted to have in the

192
00:10:05,245 --> 00:10:10,266
very beginning of how are the character classes balanced and what is the state of the balance

193
00:10:10,426 --> 00:10:11,306
in our single player game.

194
00:10:12,387 --> 00:10:17,948
As it turns out, the spread between all the classes from our sample size wasn't as large

195
00:10:18,168 --> 00:10:19,548
as people perceived it to be.

196
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:26,930
Even though we saw some characters with high variance in their rankings, what it did do

197
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:30,771
is it sparked a discussion by those who rated it very highly with those who rated it very

198
00:10:35,072 --> 00:10:36,273
By framing the discussion this way,

199
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:37,733
we were able to have the community talk

200
00:10:37,794 --> 00:10:40,395
in a shared vernacular, making it easier for us

201
00:10:40,435 --> 00:10:41,735
to disseminate the conversation

202
00:10:42,335 --> 00:10:44,036
into any required actions on our part.

203
00:10:44,576 --> 00:10:46,777
More importantly, it allowed the community

204
00:10:46,837 --> 00:10:49,018
to share information which resulted in some cases

205
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:51,119
of players finding new means to play characters

206
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:52,700
that they had previously rated poorly

207
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,241
with no real actions from us, which is, I think, a big win.

208
00:10:59,516 --> 00:11:02,418
Now later we did use that feedback to make some adjustments in places,

209
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:06,160
but by taking the extra two weeks to post the survey,

210
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,421
present the data back to the players,

211
00:11:08,981 --> 00:11:10,502
it helped avoid pushing changes

212
00:11:11,082 --> 00:11:13,604
that would have shifted a character's balance too far in one direction,

213
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:17,106
which could then result in the never-ending design yo-yo

214
00:11:17,146 --> 00:11:20,668
of balance changes and tweaks, which we all should avoid at all costs.

215
00:11:23,502 --> 00:11:25,344
Players are a huge resource

216
00:11:26,105 --> 00:11:27,866
in seeing how your game is actually played.

217
00:11:28,447 --> 00:11:29,828
Our players have helped us improve our game

218
00:11:29,888 --> 00:11:33,471
across the board, be it through class function suggestions,

219
00:11:34,452 --> 00:11:37,414
boss trophy trinkets, or the mountains and mountains

220
00:11:37,494 --> 00:11:40,276
of quality of life improvements that have accrued

221
00:11:40,396 --> 00:11:41,758
over the development cycle of the game,

222
00:11:43,479 --> 00:11:48,123
which is why it's important to give the York community

223
00:11:48,183 --> 00:11:49,204
opportunities to give back

224
00:11:49,344 --> 00:11:50,965
and to celebrate those contributions.

225
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,523
So far, all of my points have been about how to, like,

226
00:11:54,643 --> 00:11:56,105
sort of regularly structure discussion

227
00:11:56,185 --> 00:11:57,548
or the importance of taking the time

228
00:11:57,608 --> 00:11:59,531
to make sure the community has this framework

229
00:11:59,551 --> 00:12:01,534
or shared vernacular to have discourse.

230
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:04,499
But it's also important to find spots

231
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:06,542
where you can allow them to contribute

232
00:12:06,602 --> 00:12:07,644
in a less formalized way.

233
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:13,583
As an example, back during our Kickstarter, we had backers submit party names for certain

234
00:12:13,663 --> 00:12:15,544
combinations of our characters in a specific order.

235
00:12:16,245 --> 00:12:19,607
If you've played, you've probably seen this already, but as an example, all of our players

236
00:12:19,647 --> 00:12:21,068
start with a Crusader and a Highwayman.

237
00:12:22,169 --> 00:12:25,150
And then when they make their first party, we give them a Plague Doctor and a Vestal.

238
00:12:26,952 --> 00:12:28,252
When they arrange them in an order,

239
00:12:28,572 --> 00:12:30,173
in the order on the screen above,

240
00:12:30,793 --> 00:12:31,974
they get the usual suspects.

241
00:12:32,714 --> 00:12:34,274
And everyone always talks about this.

242
00:12:34,655 --> 00:12:36,315
It's a great little community facet.

243
00:12:37,476 --> 00:12:39,456
Now these offer no sort of in-game bonus.

244
00:12:39,796 --> 00:12:40,717
It's strictly flavor.

245
00:12:41,997 --> 00:12:43,998
But it was flavor that our Kickstarter backers,

246
00:12:44,058 --> 00:12:46,119
that cohort of our community, was able to give to us

247
00:12:46,319 --> 00:12:47,299
and imbue on the game.

248
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,920
And like I said, it's a great feature.

249
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,841
Players respond to these things.

250
00:12:50,861 --> 00:12:52,021
They always, like, when they discover them

251
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:54,142
for the first time, it's like a nice moment of discovery.

252
00:12:56,524 --> 00:12:58,966
So when this happened, the Kickstarter backers basically filled out a survey.

253
00:12:59,886 --> 00:13:02,948
They had all the current available character classes attached to the name,

254
00:13:02,968 --> 00:13:04,029
and then we filtered through it,

255
00:13:04,749 --> 00:13:09,512
and, you know, cut all the obscene or nonsensical submissions,

256
00:13:09,532 --> 00:13:10,653
and then we just jammed them into the game.

257
00:13:13,314 --> 00:13:15,436
When we originally did this, all the characters weren't in the game yet.

258
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:18,460
Since that time, we've added, I believe,

259
00:13:18,521 --> 00:13:20,362
five new character classes to the game.

260
00:13:20,662 --> 00:13:23,185
And we never gave the community an opportunity

261
00:13:23,225 --> 00:13:26,928
to sort of give party combos for those existing ones.

262
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:31,352
So we got a form ready to have players

263
00:13:31,372 --> 00:13:32,253
submit a new batch of names.

264
00:13:32,713 --> 00:13:33,734
And this paired up really well

265
00:13:33,774 --> 00:13:35,096
with our most recent Radiant update,

266
00:13:35,116 --> 00:13:36,857
which was a free update for all of our players

267
00:13:37,258 --> 00:13:38,759
and was designed to respond

268
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:40,420
to some of the largest community concerns

269
00:13:40,441 --> 00:13:41,401
that had appeared over the year.

270
00:13:43,676 --> 00:13:48,881
The other nice thing about doing the survey is that the process to get them in was pretty low impact on the team.

271
00:13:49,822 --> 00:13:54,887
For instance, it was something that I was able to manage all on my own as the community manager, which is also a big win.

272
00:13:55,368 --> 00:14:00,493
So in a sense it was a super clean way to allow for the community to have an opportunity to contribute directly to the game

273
00:14:01,454 --> 00:14:05,799
with very little formality compared to how I structure things throughout the community elsewhere.

274
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:10,143
uh... in a sense this is a slam dunk for us uh... you know it's just a great way

275
00:14:10,163 --> 00:14:13,025
to bank a lot of community goodwill and it's just a really simple thing for us

276
00:14:13,065 --> 00:14:13,726
to sort of do

277
00:14:13,746 --> 00:14:16,248
uh... this is sort of the form that we used

278
00:14:18,969 --> 00:14:20,310
When things like this work out,

279
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,311
it's important to credit and highlight,

280
00:14:23,052 --> 00:14:25,053
especially when those additions come in.

281
00:14:25,454 --> 00:14:27,275
And sometimes that's easier than others,

282
00:14:27,355 --> 00:14:28,516
like in the two examples above.

283
00:14:29,396 --> 00:14:32,779
But be sure when you do give credit to your community,

284
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:35,761
it's not first and foremost to the specific individuals,

285
00:14:36,321 --> 00:14:37,462
but to the community at large.

286
00:14:38,463 --> 00:14:40,024
Now, this gives focus to the community.

287
00:14:40,896 --> 00:14:42,618
quote, not just as the individual,

288
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:44,399
which helps reinforce the shared culture

289
00:14:44,419 --> 00:14:46,801
that we're trying to build for everyone

290
00:14:46,821 --> 00:14:48,242
and not focuses just on the game,

291
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:49,564
but on the community at large.

292
00:14:53,107 --> 00:14:54,768
So those are some of the ways that I wanted to talk

293
00:14:55,008 --> 00:14:56,810
about being a community camp counselor.

294
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,351
Now I wanted to pivot a little bit

295
00:14:58,852 --> 00:15:00,653
to areas that are within the same theme,

296
00:15:00,894 --> 00:15:03,096
but might not relate directly to my previous points

297
00:15:03,156 --> 00:15:04,997
of like being the camp counselor.

298
00:15:06,278 --> 00:15:07,780
And the first thing I would like to talk about

299
00:15:09,049 --> 00:15:12,011
in that understanding the cohorts that comprise your community is

300
00:15:12,951 --> 00:15:16,553
understanding that players attach themselves to the state of the game when purchased.

301
00:15:18,233 --> 00:15:20,975
We discovered an example of this during our days in Early Access.

302
00:15:21,575 --> 00:15:23,716
There's this concept called the endowment effect.

303
00:15:23,976 --> 00:15:25,637
It comes from the field of behavioral economics.

304
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:30,139
Essentially what it means...

305
00:15:31,693 --> 00:15:33,755
is that once you own something, you prescribe to it

306
00:15:33,775 --> 00:15:36,197
a higher value than what you would have normally purchased.

307
00:15:36,297 --> 00:15:37,398
That's the very same thing for

308
00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:39,280
if you didn't already have it.

309
00:15:40,621 --> 00:15:43,264
Another way is if I were to purchase something from you

310
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:46,747
that you value, you will generally demand more money from me

311
00:15:47,808 --> 00:15:49,049
than what you had originally paid,

312
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:50,451
even if that amount was zero.

313
00:15:51,472 --> 00:15:53,634
So that's just what endowment effect is in general.

314
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:58,886
So even though an early access is a platform that highly advertises itself

315
00:15:59,206 --> 00:16:04,649
for games in development, ripe with future changes through the duration of early access itself,

316
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:10,853
players still attach themselves as owners to the game in the state at which they purchased it.

317
00:16:12,234 --> 00:16:16,196
It follows then that as we implemented larger feature sets that dramatically affected the game,

318
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:20,519
players felt as if this was no longer the game that they had purchased.

319
00:16:22,143 --> 00:16:24,864
And we did not add enough value through those changes

320
00:16:25,265 --> 00:16:28,486
to offset their endowed value that they had attached

321
00:16:28,586 --> 00:16:29,627
to the game since purchase.

322
00:16:31,948 --> 00:16:33,809
We had this play out in our Corpse and Hound update,

323
00:16:33,929 --> 00:16:35,430
which is well documented online.

324
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,911
We've given past talks on it,

325
00:16:37,331 --> 00:16:39,832
and if you want it, you can go find more information on it.

326
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:40,513
But essentially.

327
00:16:42,393 --> 00:16:44,954
We did this as a patch to sort of introduce big combat,

328
00:16:44,974 --> 00:16:46,875
more depth, give it more strategic depth,

329
00:16:47,336 --> 00:16:49,637
and a better way to promote party compositions

330
00:16:50,357 --> 00:16:52,819
and diversity and just sort of give the game

331
00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:55,860
more everything that it needed.

332
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,081
It was a super important thing for us.

333
00:16:57,681 --> 00:16:59,202
But essentially, it created a large schism

334
00:16:59,222 --> 00:17:00,423
with the vocal parts of our community.

335
00:17:01,443 --> 00:17:03,304
Half of them feeling as if we took away their game

336
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:06,026
and that negative value was compounded

337
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,767
by the additional value that they had endowed

338
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:08,627
to it since purchase.

339
00:17:09,468 --> 00:17:10,789
The result was not great.

340
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:16,826
To say the least, we had a very upset group of players who felt we had essentially ruined

341
00:17:16,846 --> 00:17:20,850
the game completely, and there was a very visible and well-documented backlash.

342
00:17:23,433 --> 00:17:25,474
So after that, I was hired and we changed our strategy.

343
00:17:26,275 --> 00:17:29,276
The plan was to give our community members more information

344
00:17:29,356 --> 00:17:31,358
to better communicate design goals and intentions

345
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:32,438
on a regular basis.

346
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:34,940
By doing this, we could better equip

347
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,881
our more active players with the tools

348
00:17:36,941 --> 00:17:39,963
to help ensure that the dialogue between players and us

349
00:17:40,043 --> 00:17:41,984
was always well understood by both parties.

350
00:17:42,584 --> 00:17:44,646
And through consistency, the level of discussion

351
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,387
would maintain that relative structure

352
00:17:46,447 --> 00:17:48,988
without constant guidance by me or the members of the team.

353
00:17:51,436 --> 00:17:53,796
Again, I feel that the problem above is not one of management.

354
00:17:54,668 --> 00:17:56,069
but one of communication and culture.

355
00:17:56,769 --> 00:17:57,610
Many times it feels,

356
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:59,451
when we do our big community discussions,

357
00:18:00,011 --> 00:18:02,232
it's more like group therapy than anything else.

358
00:18:02,972 --> 00:18:04,013
And this isn't a bad thing.

359
00:18:04,473 --> 00:18:05,794
I actually think this is super helpful

360
00:18:05,814 --> 00:18:06,914
to view it from this angle.

361
00:18:07,775 --> 00:18:09,235
We present our intentions to the player.

362
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:11,996
The players then give us their feelings on the matter.

363
00:18:12,437 --> 00:18:14,478
And then my job is then to sort of build

364
00:18:14,518 --> 00:18:16,499
a strong framework for that discussion to take place

365
00:18:16,999 --> 00:18:20,420
so that we can sort of push past the knee-jerk reactions

366
00:18:20,821 --> 00:18:21,981
and dig into the heart of the matter

367
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:24,082
when it comes to feedback and talking through an issue.

368
00:18:25,917 --> 00:18:28,618
Another interesting thing we learned as we encountered,

369
00:18:28,638 --> 00:18:30,099
or another interesting thing we encountered

370
00:18:30,239 --> 00:18:32,360
as we learned more about the cohorts within our community

371
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,481
was the difference in expectations

372
00:18:34,641 --> 00:18:37,222
between players who purchased during early access

373
00:18:37,802 --> 00:18:39,623
and those who purchased after full release,

374
00:18:39,983 --> 00:18:41,204
which leads me to my final point.

375
00:18:42,604 --> 00:18:44,625
Give players means to continue the relationships

376
00:18:44,645 --> 00:18:46,166
that they establish with us.

377
00:18:47,287 --> 00:18:48,207
Emphasis on they.

378
00:18:51,507 --> 00:18:54,388
Darkest Dungeon exited Early Access in January 19th of 2016.

379
00:18:54,428 --> 00:18:57,289
This opened up the final dungeon,

380
00:18:57,329 --> 00:18:58,950
which had more monsters content

381
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,150
than any other region in the game

382
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,171
and ultimately allowed players to beat the game.

383
00:19:03,531 --> 00:19:04,451
While in Early Access,

384
00:19:04,491 --> 00:19:07,312
we would push builds and fixes as they came up.

385
00:19:08,173 --> 00:19:10,013
Sure, we had big milestone updates

386
00:19:10,093 --> 00:19:11,894
like the Corpse and Hound or the Abomination update,

387
00:19:12,314 --> 00:19:14,415
but we also just fired out builds as we iterated.

388
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:16,215
We were just crushing it.

389
00:19:17,714 --> 00:19:21,741
If anything, our players were really hungry for every update, with a finger on the comment button.

390
00:19:22,643 --> 00:19:25,949
Just something we didn't account for, though, was how this expectation was going to switch

391
00:19:26,169 --> 00:19:27,892
when we went from early access to full release.

392
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,683
Players who are not early access players

393
00:19:32,763 --> 00:19:34,304
and purchased the game at release

394
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:36,526
apparently did not want weekly updates.

395
00:19:37,547 --> 00:19:40,088
And if we rolled out too many patches close together,

396
00:19:40,188 --> 00:19:42,830
be it new content or non-crash-related tweaks

397
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,292
and bug fixes, some of our full release players

398
00:19:45,332 --> 00:19:47,794
would then vocalize their dissatisfaction with us.

399
00:19:48,394 --> 00:19:49,575
Is the game not done yet?

400
00:19:51,516 --> 00:19:54,058
Another indie dev releasing a half-finished product?

401
00:19:54,078 --> 00:19:55,399
We all have heard this before.

402
00:19:58,227 --> 00:20:00,448
Conversely, our early access players

403
00:20:00,889 --> 00:20:02,329
did not want these updates to stop.

404
00:20:02,849 --> 00:20:04,550
And if we waited too long to update,

405
00:20:04,891 --> 00:20:06,912
they would also express their dissatisfaction with us.

406
00:20:07,912 --> 00:20:10,253
And playing a game while it's in development

407
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,834
sure feels a lot like an online game with LiveOps.

408
00:20:13,835 --> 00:20:16,336
Even though our game was a solitary offline experience,

409
00:20:16,856 --> 00:20:17,697
a single player game,

410
00:20:17,977 --> 00:20:20,538
we had players who expected LiveOps behavior from us

411
00:20:20,718 --> 00:20:23,260
due to our iterative release process through early access.

412
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,642
So we had to strike a balance between the two groups,

413
00:20:28,882 --> 00:20:31,384
maintaining our active and fruitful relationships

414
00:20:31,424 --> 00:20:32,505
with our early access players,

415
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:35,147
without rocking the boat too severely or too frequently

416
00:20:35,187 --> 00:20:37,089
for those who expect a less organic

417
00:20:37,289 --> 00:20:39,931
or perhaps even a more monolithic

418
00:20:39,971 --> 00:20:40,892
structured product release.

419
00:20:42,233 --> 00:20:45,435
So what we did is we began to do short public betas

420
00:20:45,515 --> 00:20:47,677
prior to release to sort of solve this problem.

421
00:20:49,146 --> 00:20:51,528
It allowed us to retain our early access relationship,

422
00:20:51,848 --> 00:20:53,469
player relationship, player relationship,

423
00:20:53,509 --> 00:20:56,091
without harming our new full release player base.

424
00:20:57,532 --> 00:20:58,493
When a new patch was ready,

425
00:20:58,893 --> 00:21:00,935
we would roll it out into a beta stage

426
00:21:00,975 --> 00:21:03,256
and announce to our players that they could opt in via Steam.

427
00:21:03,676 --> 00:21:04,597
We collected their feedback,

428
00:21:04,737 --> 00:21:07,679
push updates live like we did during the early access stage.

429
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,381
And then as soon as we felt confident in the stability

430
00:21:10,581 --> 00:21:12,303
and the contents that they're in,

431
00:21:12,463 --> 00:21:14,044
we would then push it live to all of our players.

432
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:21,497
While this in itself isn't anything technically groundbreaking, we found it was a great way

433
00:21:21,517 --> 00:21:25,443
to maintain and grow positive benefits of long-standing relationships that we had formed

434
00:21:25,463 --> 00:21:30,712
with our early adopters, and without disrupting the live game unnecessarily.

435
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:34,563
When combined with the efforts to structure discourse

436
00:21:34,623 --> 00:21:37,624
on our social boards, allowing for our past

437
00:21:37,704 --> 00:21:39,885
iterative workflow to exist post-release,

438
00:21:40,846 --> 00:21:44,147
allowed new players to come to the table to our game

439
00:21:44,187 --> 00:21:45,848
in ways that they hadn't expected elsewhere

440
00:21:45,908 --> 00:21:48,649
with other games, which then feeds back

441
00:21:48,689 --> 00:21:50,750
into the community at large once more

442
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:52,271
and sort of keeps that whole cycle going.

443
00:21:54,272 --> 00:21:55,973
All these methods we implemented

444
00:21:56,093 --> 00:21:57,174
all started from the same spot,

445
00:21:57,374 --> 00:22:00,335
ensuring an open and honest discussion with our players.

446
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:03,051
By being a good camp counselor,

447
00:22:03,151 --> 00:22:05,293
we can make sure that not only do we get our intentions

448
00:22:05,413 --> 00:22:08,335
known to our players, but it also signals to them

449
00:22:08,415 --> 00:22:10,557
that we are listening and acting where appropriate.

450
00:22:11,658 --> 00:22:13,600
All feedback has some facet of value,

451
00:22:14,521 --> 00:22:16,682
and when you position yourself as a camp counselor

452
00:22:17,023 --> 00:22:19,325
with the aim to listen and understand both parties,

453
00:22:19,945 --> 00:22:23,268
the team and our players, that's when the magic happens.

454
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:30,374
So to recap, be a community camp counselor,

455
00:22:31,627 --> 00:22:34,849
understand the position or how you want to position yourselves relative to your players,

456
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:42,694
why it's important to build a structural framework for discourse within the community, give your

457
00:22:42,714 --> 00:22:46,457
community opportunities to give back and celebrate those contributions, whether it be through

458
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:53,381
very rigorous formal framing or through just very easy low barrier means, and then also

459
00:22:53,561 --> 00:22:55,503
knowing the cohorts that comprise your community.

460
00:22:56,798 --> 00:22:57,899
You need to take the time to understand

461
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,360
how to effectively communicate to all of them

462
00:23:00,681 --> 00:23:01,622
and know where they are.

463
00:23:02,222 --> 00:23:04,664
And you also need to make sure you give them the means

464
00:23:04,844 --> 00:23:07,266
to continue the relationship that they establish with you,

465
00:23:07,306 --> 00:23:08,586
whether it be from early access

466
00:23:08,667 --> 00:23:09,907
in that stage of the development,

467
00:23:10,528 --> 00:23:13,150
or full release, or the DLC, or whatever it is,

468
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,991
whatever position that you have people on board.

469
00:23:18,353 --> 00:23:20,394
Okay, and thank you so much for your time.

470
00:23:22,065 --> 00:23:24,407
I will have a few minutes, it looks, for questions.

471
00:23:25,068 --> 00:23:27,110
So if you want to, hop in front of a mic,

472
00:23:27,851 --> 00:23:29,412
and I'll be more than happy to answer any questions

473
00:23:29,452 --> 00:23:30,934
in relations to our community.

474
00:23:31,674 --> 00:23:31,915
Thank you.

475
00:23:37,518 --> 00:23:37,718
Go ahead.

476
00:23:38,278 --> 00:23:40,680
Hey there, I wanted to ask a question about the thing

477
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,622
about the giving credit back to the community

478
00:23:42,662 --> 00:23:43,542
as opposed to individuals.

479
00:23:43,703 --> 00:23:44,763
So you're the naming thing,

480
00:23:45,044 --> 00:23:46,485
and I've got a couple things like that in my game.

481
00:23:46,505 --> 00:23:49,547
So did you not mention the community members

482
00:23:49,607 --> 00:23:50,648
that came up with the names at all,

483
00:23:50,668 --> 00:23:53,430
and you just said this is a community-generated name?

484
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:55,171
Or how did that work more specifically?

485
00:23:55,499 --> 00:23:59,321
So in specifics to the example that I gave about the party name combinations,

486
00:24:00,282 --> 00:24:03,604
I did not give any credit specifically to any of the members who came up with them.

487
00:24:04,284 --> 00:24:08,867
What happened though is after we released them, I put a huge list of all the names that had made it in,

488
00:24:09,527 --> 00:24:12,269
and then players sort of like went through and looked at it and said,

489
00:24:12,289 --> 00:24:15,611
hey, like mine made it in, and then they sort of dispersed that information out.

490
00:24:16,992 --> 00:24:18,553
For other things in which we've had,

491
00:24:18,573 --> 00:24:21,955
the boss trophy trinkets that I had mentioned

492
00:24:21,975 --> 00:24:22,856
in the talk as well,

493
00:24:23,997 --> 00:24:26,158
that was a specific person who just like on a lark

494
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,040
made this big list of things I'd like to see

495
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,941
and we read it and we're like, yo, that's awesome.

496
00:24:31,142 --> 00:24:31,682
Let's do that.

497
00:24:32,603 --> 00:24:34,504
So we did it, and then at first we said,

498
00:24:35,205 --> 00:24:36,966
when we made the announcement that those were coming in,

499
00:24:37,006 --> 00:24:39,248
we said, hey, this is something that came from the community

500
00:24:39,288 --> 00:24:41,569
and then near the bottom at the end of the wrap up,

501
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:43,731
we would say, hey, thanks to this person.

502
00:24:43,931 --> 00:24:45,913
So we still find ways to give credit to them,

503
00:24:45,953 --> 00:24:48,034
but the first and foremost thing to do

504
00:24:48,134 --> 00:24:49,535
is to credit the community at large.

505
00:24:50,036 --> 00:24:50,396
Cool, thanks.

506
00:24:51,237 --> 00:24:51,377
Yep.

507
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:54,779
Anyone else?

508
00:24:58,182 --> 00:24:58,902
All right, cool.

509
00:24:59,523 --> 00:24:59,963
Thank you very much.
