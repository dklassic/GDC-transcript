1
00:00:11,809 --> 00:00:17,771
This talk is post-mortem-like, and it's a story about our recently released game Outriders,

2
00:00:18,092 --> 00:00:22,913
and I also decided to change the title yesterday, so please don't be confused.

3
00:00:24,234 --> 00:00:29,056
Before we start, I can ask you to switch your electronic devices to silent mode.

4
00:00:29,996 --> 00:00:31,617
Yeah, and enjoy the talk.

5
00:00:33,862 --> 00:00:35,583
So, let's move to chapter one then.

6
00:00:36,624 --> 00:00:38,625
When I was in high school,

7
00:00:39,286 --> 00:00:40,787
I was watching the Shell Pack TV series.

8
00:00:41,507 --> 00:00:43,188
At that time, it was yet another cartoon

9
00:00:44,109 --> 00:00:45,850
for me with some crazy, awkward,

10
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:48,913
and sometimes even stupid scenarios and punchlines.

11
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:50,674
Nothing more than that.

12
00:00:51,795 --> 00:00:53,816
But a few years ago, when I was preparing myself

13
00:00:53,856 --> 00:00:56,018
for a workshop about the MVP concept

14
00:00:56,198 --> 00:00:58,359
and experimental approach to software development,

15
00:00:59,384 --> 00:01:04,368
I was doing some research and I found, by accident of course, a part of an old episode

16
00:01:04,408 --> 00:01:04,948
of Saltpark.

17
00:01:05,769 --> 00:01:07,951
It was about NOMS Corporation.

18
00:01:09,012 --> 00:01:09,512
And you know what?

19
00:01:10,513 --> 00:01:13,675
That time I felt I was being enlightened.

20
00:01:15,016 --> 00:01:21,661
NOMS from Saltpark revealed to me the secret formula for how to make every business successful.

21
00:01:22,844 --> 00:01:27,529
And I will share it with you today for free, just like that.

22
00:01:28,451 --> 00:01:31,494
And to give you a better context and understanding,

23
00:01:31,995 --> 00:01:36,080
let's watch the short fragment of this episode in the first place.

24
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:39,859
Damn dude, this place is huge!

25
00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:42,360
Yeah, it's almost as big as Cartman's ass!

26
00:01:43,081 --> 00:01:44,421
Nowhere is it you guys!

27
00:01:44,581 --> 00:01:46,382
This is where all our work is done!

28
00:01:46,742 --> 00:01:48,803
So what are you gonna do with all these underpants that you steal?

29
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:50,984
Collecting underpants is just phase one.

30
00:01:51,465 --> 00:01:52,945
Phase one, collect underpants.

31
00:01:53,445 --> 00:01:54,706
So, what's phase two?

32
00:01:58,648 --> 00:02:00,329
Hey! What's phase two?

33
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:02,470
Phase one, we collect underpants.

34
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,591
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but what about phase two?

35
00:02:07,407 --> 00:02:09,589
Well, phase three is profit, get it?

36
00:02:09,909 --> 00:02:10,409
I don't get it.

37
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:12,931
You see, phase one, collect underpants.

38
00:02:13,371 --> 00:02:13,932
Phase two?

39
00:02:15,493 --> 00:02:16,653
Phase three, profit!

40
00:02:17,114 --> 00:02:17,834
Oh, I get it.

41
00:02:17,854 --> 00:02:18,995
No you don't, fat ass.

42
00:02:19,195 --> 00:02:20,856
Do you guys know anything about corporations?

43
00:02:21,196 --> 00:02:22,257
You bet we do.

44
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,318
Us gnomes are geniuses at corporations.

45
00:02:24,579 --> 00:02:25,799
Time to go to work.

46
00:02:25,839 --> 00:02:27,260
Work is gonna start.

47
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,641
Jesus Christ, look out!

48
00:02:31,183 --> 00:02:32,724
Oh my god, they killed Kenny. You bastards.

49
00:02:34,525 --> 00:02:37,647
Cool, so once again, this is the secret formula.

50
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:40,048
Phase one, collect underpants.

51
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:41,448
Phase two.

52
00:02:42,649 --> 00:02:44,369
And the phase three, profit.

53
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:46,910
That's all you need in order to achieve a success.

54
00:02:48,011 --> 00:02:48,851
You can trust the gnomes.

55
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:52,392
But let's check if this formula works for different cases.

56
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,674
Let's assume that we want to collect seashells, for example.

57
00:02:57,174 --> 00:02:58,215
So this is the phase one.

58
00:02:59,135 --> 00:03:00,796
Then we are moving to phase two.

59
00:03:01,816 --> 00:03:04,017
And phase three is a profit.

60
00:03:04,796 --> 00:03:06,056
So it works again.

61
00:03:07,217 --> 00:03:07,477
Cool.

62
00:03:08,517 --> 00:03:10,578
Let's move to the game this time.

63
00:03:11,238 --> 00:03:13,439
Phase one, we get an idea for the game.

64
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,361
Phase two, and we get a profit.

65
00:03:19,422 --> 00:03:22,123
So it works again, genius.

66
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:25,704
But let's put jokes aside for a moment

67
00:03:26,364 --> 00:03:30,726
and try to find real wisdom about the dom's plan.

68
00:03:32,435 --> 00:03:35,556
I hope that you'll agree with me that when it comes to the Phase I,

69
00:03:36,057 --> 00:03:38,797
everything starts with an idea, with a concept,

70
00:03:39,337 --> 00:03:41,738
with some plan for a business or a game.

71
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:45,079
Then, when it comes to the Phase III,

72
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:49,320
the goal of our effort is to deliver the best experience for the players

73
00:03:49,881 --> 00:03:51,981
and gain profit. And I want to be clear here that

74
00:03:52,801 --> 00:03:55,422
I don't understand profit only in the case of money.

75
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:59,003
You can define profit in many different ways.

76
00:04:00,264 --> 00:04:03,585
But phase two is something which is unique for each of us.

77
00:04:05,065 --> 00:04:06,886
And I formulated three premises here

78
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:08,426
when it comes to this uniqueness.

79
00:04:08,926 --> 00:04:12,847
I mean that we are all in a different business context.

80
00:04:13,507 --> 00:04:14,347
This is the first one.

81
00:04:14,707 --> 00:04:17,828
The second one, we want to answer different players'

82
00:04:17,968 --> 00:04:18,668
expectations.

83
00:04:19,449 --> 00:04:22,909
And the third one, we have different production pipelines,

84
00:04:23,149 --> 00:04:27,110
experience, and best practices that we are using.

85
00:04:28,803 --> 00:04:32,604
That's why it's really hard to find one way of working

86
00:04:32,624 --> 00:04:36,646
or one specific way to always be successful

87
00:04:36,706 --> 00:04:38,267
when it comes to the game development.

88
00:04:39,147 --> 00:04:44,169
And this phase two, for me, is actually the development.

89
00:04:45,181 --> 00:04:52,927
That's the reason why I'm here. I want to share with you our experience from Outriders production, from making Outriders.

90
00:04:53,447 --> 00:04:58,211
It doesn't mean that our way is the only way or that I will preach the greatness of People Can Fly.

91
00:04:59,652 --> 00:05:04,316
Nothing of that. However, People Can Fly is a great company, so join us.

92
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:08,793
But as I said, we are all different when it comes to

93
00:05:08,813 --> 00:05:11,835
phase two, which is pretty cool by the way.

94
00:05:12,656 --> 00:05:15,358
And I do believe that having conferences like GDC

95
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:17,259
or other events, meetups or so on,

96
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,962
we can share our thoughts and learn from each other.

97
00:05:21,603 --> 00:05:25,406
Thanks to that, try new methods later in the development

98
00:05:26,006 --> 00:05:26,727
or in the production.

99
00:05:27,507 --> 00:05:30,850
So my name is Adam Alker and I am a head of

100
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,291
transformation at People Can Fly,

101
00:05:32,371 --> 00:05:34,033
also acting as a head of development.

102
00:05:35,016 --> 00:05:39,877
And I'm here today to share with you our long, bumpy journey

103
00:05:40,097 --> 00:05:42,218
of releasing the Outriders.

104
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:46,318
Let's move to the chapter two.

105
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:50,859
You know people can fly from producing awesome shooter games

106
00:05:50,999 --> 00:05:54,080
like Painkiller, Bulletstorm, Gears of War, Judgment,

107
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,880
and, of course, Outriders.

108
00:05:56,381 --> 00:05:58,781
We also have one of the most skillful Unreal Engine

109
00:05:59,181 --> 00:06:00,321
developers in the world.

110
00:06:01,149 --> 00:06:04,152
This year we'll have the 20th anniversary,

111
00:06:04,712 --> 00:06:08,635
which means 20 years experience of creating games.

112
00:06:10,257 --> 00:06:15,561
In 2016, the company made a strategic decision.

113
00:06:16,742 --> 00:06:18,764
We separated from Epic Games

114
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,786
and started our new chapter,

115
00:06:22,307 --> 00:06:25,470
our new production, which was Outriders.

116
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:31,955
We were very excited when Square Enix decided to accept our pitch and go with the franchise.

117
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:36,499
There were around 40 aviators at the time.

118
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,922
And you can see where we started.

119
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:43,525
Those are two pics from our office at the time.

120
00:06:44,266 --> 00:06:45,367
It was pretty cool.

121
00:06:47,048 --> 00:06:49,230
But we were speaking about the madness.

122
00:06:52,073 --> 00:06:52,813
Do you know this movie?

123
00:06:54,066 --> 00:06:55,647
Yeah, of course you do.

124
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:56,988
This is a scene from 300, yeah?

125
00:06:57,489 --> 00:06:59,490
The Persian emissary comes to Leonidas,

126
00:07:00,691 --> 00:07:03,433
the king of Sparta, and ask him to bow

127
00:07:03,473 --> 00:07:05,394
in front of the Persian ruler Xerxes.

128
00:07:06,475 --> 00:07:08,377
But proud Leonidas refuses that act,

129
00:07:09,858 --> 00:07:12,720
and short commissary says this epic verse, yeah?

130
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,002
This is blasphemy, this is madness.

131
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:18,124
Madness?

132
00:07:19,645 --> 00:07:21,526
As Leonidas then looks at his wife's eyes.

133
00:07:22,372 --> 00:07:24,993
No, this, S.

134
00:07:26,374 --> 00:07:27,114
Can you help me with this?

135
00:07:27,134 --> 00:07:27,434
Spark.

136
00:07:27,454 --> 00:07:27,634
Spark.

137
00:07:29,675 --> 00:07:31,937
Cool, but actually he says something else.

138
00:07:32,637 --> 00:07:34,138
He said, this is Outriders.

139
00:07:35,899 --> 00:07:37,339
No kidding, it was true.

140
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,221
Madness was our code name.

141
00:07:41,262 --> 00:07:43,543
And this is my first takeaway for you.

142
00:07:43,903 --> 00:07:47,205
Never, ever use this code name for your game.

143
00:07:49,183 --> 00:07:52,024
The old Latin proverb, nomen est domen,

144
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:57,005
which means the name is a sign, was fucking true here.

145
00:07:57,926 --> 00:08:01,787
Our journey to release the game was a true madness.

146
00:08:03,928 --> 00:08:04,108
Why?

147
00:08:05,576 --> 00:08:07,878
From the idea for creating a small game,

148
00:08:07,938 --> 00:08:09,939
we grew up to the AAA production.

149
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,341
It wasn't our intention from the beginning

150
00:08:12,381 --> 00:08:14,103
to create a AAA game.

151
00:08:14,723 --> 00:08:17,345
From the local studio, we grew up to the global company.

152
00:08:17,986 --> 00:08:19,907
From the original idea of releasing the game

153
00:08:20,888 --> 00:08:24,151
for the old-gen consoles, we end up being

154
00:08:24,591 --> 00:08:26,673
one of the very first game for the next-gen

155
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:29,655
and ready for the full cross-play.

156
00:08:30,415 --> 00:08:31,977
After a very promising demo release,

157
00:08:32,835 --> 00:08:38,478
We had to struggle with extremely annoying ghost bugs related to inventory wipeout and disconnects.

158
00:08:39,199 --> 00:08:46,762
We started from producing one project and had to learn how to manage the production several projects at the same time.

159
00:08:47,603 --> 00:08:56,147
Not mentioning, you know, our own huge ambitions, COVID-19 and the others that I will elaborate on later.

160
00:08:56,888 --> 00:08:58,148
That was madness.

161
00:08:59,913 --> 00:09:03,377
but against the 300 ended with a victory.

162
00:09:04,338 --> 00:09:08,363
Now, as you can see, we're located in North America

163
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:09,264
and also in Europe.

164
00:09:10,105 --> 00:09:14,270
This little red dot is showing our headquarter

165
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,311
in Warsaw in Poland.

166
00:09:15,831 --> 00:09:17,513
This is the place where I came from.

167
00:09:19,167 --> 00:09:21,489
We also moved to different locations,

168
00:09:22,951 --> 00:09:26,594
which are much more bigger and enhancing our creativity.

169
00:09:27,574 --> 00:09:30,797
So that's about people can fly, and now we

170
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:36,702
can move exactly to the journey of creating the game.

171
00:09:40,665 --> 00:09:40,846
Yeah.

172
00:09:41,906 --> 00:09:44,949
You know, since this is a production track,

173
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,911
it's highly recommended to show some gun shot.

174
00:09:48,598 --> 00:09:51,579
or the process chart or any other kind of the chart

175
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,581
to make this presentation look more professional.

176
00:09:55,581 --> 00:09:58,182
And yeah, that's why I also have one for you

177
00:09:58,883 --> 00:10:00,283
regarding the process.

178
00:10:01,224 --> 00:10:04,485
So when we are speaking about the production phases,

179
00:10:05,406 --> 00:10:07,247
I have in mind at least four of them.

180
00:10:07,687 --> 00:10:10,949
I mean the concept one, then we go with the pre-production,

181
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:12,589
then we have the production,

182
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:16,111
and we are finishing with the post-release.

183
00:10:17,932 --> 00:10:22,395
Each of them has some gates or outcomes

184
00:10:22,435 --> 00:10:23,976
that you want to achieve.

185
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:29,200
So I would just focus about a pitch gate,

186
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,562
which is ending up the concept phase.

187
00:10:31,982 --> 00:10:32,843
During the pre-production,

188
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:34,684
we've got a first playable in Vertica Slice.

189
00:10:34,744 --> 00:10:35,685
Then during the production,

190
00:10:35,725 --> 00:10:38,067
we've got the alpha, beta, content log,

191
00:10:39,087 --> 00:10:40,949
ZBR, goal to release,

192
00:10:41,569 --> 00:10:43,971
and then we are moving to the live ops.

193
00:10:44,892 --> 00:10:46,734
And I'm aware that depending on the game scope,

194
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,178
genre, or the business model,

195
00:10:49,678 --> 00:10:53,043
definitions of the gates and outcomes may vary.

196
00:10:53,123 --> 00:10:56,027
That's why I want to bring you the two definitions

197
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:58,451
that we'll need for today's presentation,

198
00:10:59,112 --> 00:11:01,615
for the first playable and the vertical slice.

199
00:11:04,489 --> 00:11:09,172
For us, first playable should give you the taste of the game

200
00:11:09,832 --> 00:11:12,154
and possibility to experience the fun.

201
00:11:12,814 --> 00:11:15,296
This is also the moment when you can fail fast.

202
00:11:15,856 --> 00:11:18,958
Yes, and iterate as often as you need.

203
00:11:19,739 --> 00:11:21,880
While the vertical slice should prove

204
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,742
almost all your production pipelines,

205
00:11:24,802 --> 00:11:27,904
mechanics, systems, and the art direction.

206
00:11:28,525 --> 00:11:29,045
In other words,

207
00:11:30,444 --> 00:11:40,889
After vertical slice, you should be ready to scale up your production and smoothly create the rest of the content with no radical changes, extra features, and so on.

208
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:57,238
So I would like to show you a few pics and footages from our first playable build, vertical slice build, and the game itself, just to show you the difference.

209
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,622
We'll start with the first playable.

210
00:12:10,748 --> 00:12:13,049
You can see that we are using the weapons level

211
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:14,691
just to prove the core combat loop,

212
00:12:16,472 --> 00:12:18,093
covering system, shooting,

213
00:12:20,354 --> 00:12:21,695
enemy spawning and so on.

214
00:12:23,256 --> 00:12:25,317
Just to prove what will be the idea for the game.

215
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:34,241
Yeah, we also had some levels, white box already,

216
00:12:34,762 --> 00:12:38,043
the concept for the game, where we want to

217
00:12:39,523 --> 00:12:42,184
go with the progression with the player, and so on.

218
00:12:42,264 --> 00:12:45,046
Some basics, UI as you can see here,

219
00:12:46,786 --> 00:12:48,847
and the first look of the character.

220
00:12:49,587 --> 00:12:50,888
Then we move to the vertical slice.

221
00:12:52,008 --> 00:12:56,870
As you can see, there is a significant change here.

222
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:58,511
And also.

223
00:13:00,054 --> 00:13:00,855
like a footage.

224
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:05,840
You can progress with your character,

225
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,662
you can interact with the NPCs,

226
00:13:08,943 --> 00:13:10,405
do the first quests.

227
00:13:13,868 --> 00:13:15,991
Yeah, one more.

228
00:13:20,796 --> 00:13:22,758
Showing the art direction, as I said before.

229
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,050
Cool.

230
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:29,472
And now, it's the last footage that I got for you,

231
00:13:30,072 --> 00:13:32,453
showing the released game.

232
00:13:35,735 --> 00:13:37,796
Actually, we got some out of here.

233
00:13:44,359 --> 00:13:46,239
For those of you who didn't have a chance to play,

234
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:50,101
you can see how the games look like here.

235
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:53,403
A lot of enemies, cool weapons.

236
00:14:10,062 --> 00:14:17,066
Yeah, of course we can see the difference in quality, which is something natural for the first playable vertical slice and the released game.

237
00:14:18,206 --> 00:14:20,928
And every iteration is better than the previous one.

238
00:14:21,688 --> 00:14:25,050
But in our case, there was something more here.

239
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:29,972
Through the several first playable builds, we were looking for answers on how.

240
00:14:30,757 --> 00:14:32,598
outriders should look like.

241
00:14:33,259 --> 00:14:36,020
Once we found it, we moved to the vertical slice.

242
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,362
And do you recall what I said about the vertical slice?

243
00:14:39,882 --> 00:14:42,704
That it should prove almost all your production pipelines.

244
00:14:42,764 --> 00:14:42,984
Yeah.

245
00:14:43,904 --> 00:14:46,526
Well, we thought we did it.

246
00:14:47,726 --> 00:14:51,988
Yeah, but unfortunately the reality was different.

247
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,192
And we still had to iterate with some experiments

248
00:14:56,232 --> 00:14:58,314
during the production phase, and because of that,

249
00:14:58,834 --> 00:15:00,475
modify the current pipelines.

250
00:15:01,136 --> 00:15:04,998
So as you can guess, it had an impact on the schedule,

251
00:15:05,058 --> 00:15:09,862
complicate the code, or even influence the story.

252
00:15:10,462 --> 00:15:12,964
So what we did wrong.

253
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:17,250
We were rushing too much with the schedule.

254
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,852
We thought that we need to meet each deadline

255
00:15:20,293 --> 00:15:21,894
because this is the most important thing

256
00:15:22,315 --> 00:15:26,559
instead of keeping attention on the fun and quality.

257
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,045
We wanted to include as many ideas as we had in our heads.

258
00:15:32,345 --> 00:15:36,329
Yes, trying to constantly improve the ongoing work.

259
00:15:38,116 --> 00:15:41,838
The story of the game, the story itself was evolving

260
00:15:42,278 --> 00:15:45,900
through the production phase, which was of course

261
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:49,881
generating many other complications and changes.

262
00:15:50,862 --> 00:15:52,623
And despite the experience of the core team,

263
00:15:53,904 --> 00:15:56,705
we were learning through the development

264
00:15:56,765 --> 00:15:58,026
and wanted to improve the things

265
00:15:58,626 --> 00:16:02,167
that were originally done or claimed as a release-able.

266
00:16:02,847 --> 00:16:07,128
And so we are iterating with the already closed things.

267
00:16:07,989 --> 00:16:11,049
And we scale up the team very, very quickly,

268
00:16:11,089 --> 00:16:14,330
but I will elaborate about that later.

269
00:16:17,411 --> 00:16:20,312
Please, don't copy that.

270
00:16:22,612 --> 00:16:27,017
You know, when you're in the middle of the battlefield, yes, your perspective is different.

271
00:16:27,137 --> 00:16:30,101
So back then we thought that we were great.

272
00:16:31,542 --> 00:16:36,288
But that's why I personally see a lot of sense in making postmortems or collect lessons learned

273
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:43,356
to be mindful which practices worked in the past and which you should avoid.

274
00:16:45,707 --> 00:16:50,250
So basically I see two approaches here when it comes to the pre-production

275
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:55,133
how to do things different. The first one is to make your pre-production phase

276
00:16:55,474 --> 00:17:00,737
as short as possible and the second one to extend the pre-production phase to be

277
00:17:00,857 --> 00:17:03,940
better prepared for the later stages.

278
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,962
And for us, for the AAA productions

279
00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:14,401
we think that, or we understood that it is much more efficient for us to go with the latter

280
00:17:14,941 --> 00:17:19,082
and to extend the pre-production phase rather than the production one.

281
00:17:20,363 --> 00:17:23,324
And, you know, I got some arguments for that thesis.

282
00:17:24,302 --> 00:17:28,704
and happy to discuss with you this later.

283
00:17:29,524 --> 00:17:34,906
So if you extend the pre-production phase,

284
00:17:35,546 --> 00:17:38,128
so the cost of the change management is cheaper

285
00:17:38,188 --> 00:17:40,949
for the vertical slicer and for the whole pre-production

286
00:17:40,989 --> 00:17:42,129
than for the production one.

287
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:43,030
Why?

288
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,131
Because when you are changing your pipeline,

289
00:17:47,031 --> 00:17:48,632
less people are engaged.

290
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:53,034
So because of the scale, the change management is cheaper.

291
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:58,145
The implication of the changes are impacting smaller number of teams.

292
00:17:59,126 --> 00:18:02,972
So once again, we are speaking about the scale, we are speaking about the complexity.

293
00:18:05,339 --> 00:18:08,620
Less work, usually you don't have to refactor other features

294
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,761
which potentially will use a given component.

295
00:18:12,441 --> 00:18:15,122
So this is another argument showing you

296
00:18:15,642 --> 00:18:17,943
that it is better to iterate, pivot,

297
00:18:18,003 --> 00:18:19,743
change everything during the vertical slice

298
00:18:20,223 --> 00:18:22,724
instead of the production phase.

299
00:18:23,424 --> 00:18:26,865
And finally, you are gaining more reliability

300
00:18:27,105 --> 00:18:28,405
for planning production phase.

301
00:18:28,485 --> 00:18:31,806
Yes, I mean the velocity, cost, and resources.

302
00:18:32,818 --> 00:18:39,121
We were working with the publisher on our drivers, so it was really crucial for us to be

303
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:46,764
predictive. Yes, we should predict and forecast our schedules for the next phases.

304
00:18:47,624 --> 00:18:54,927
So I do believe that this investment during the pre-production will return later.

305
00:18:57,079 --> 00:19:03,723
And as I said, we took this lesson very seriously and from that time we are paying more attention on the vertical slice

306
00:19:04,164 --> 00:19:10,868
Ensuring that we are ready to move to the next stage. It's not always easy. Yeah, it requires some negotiations and

307
00:19:11,528 --> 00:19:13,029
having solid data

308
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,331
Which will support your decision

309
00:19:16,812 --> 00:19:19,974
But as I said, you don't want to pay this debt later

310
00:19:20,998 --> 00:19:23,719
But I'm happy to discuss this thesis with you later.

311
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,340
It works for us.

312
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,302
But I can also imagine the quite opposite model

313
00:19:29,142 --> 00:19:32,604
when you want to minimize the period of this phase

314
00:19:33,044 --> 00:19:34,805
and go live as fast as possible

315
00:19:35,405 --> 00:19:37,867
and iterate taking under consideration

316
00:19:37,887 --> 00:19:38,707
the player's feedback.

317
00:19:38,727 --> 00:19:42,009
Yes, I think that it really depends on the production

318
00:19:42,029 --> 00:19:44,370
and the genre that you are working on.

319
00:19:47,091 --> 00:19:49,453
Yeah, chapter four, Brothers.

320
00:19:51,075 --> 00:19:54,976
in arms. So let's talk a little bit about scaling.

321
00:19:56,217 --> 00:19:59,377
You remember when I said that we kick off the game with 40 people

322
00:20:00,578 --> 00:20:03,718
during these five years we scale up

323
00:20:03,798 --> 00:20:07,619
the core team of Outriders IP to circa about 200 people

324
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:11,780
and at the same time people can fly globally

325
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,681
grew up to more than 500 people.

326
00:20:16,861 --> 00:20:17,401
Sounds good.

327
00:20:18,142 --> 00:20:19,922
Sounds impressive, but

328
00:20:21,398 --> 00:20:23,259
Scaling is always a challenge.

329
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,140
This is always a challenge for the company.

330
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:30,602
And let me give you some examples of issues that we had.

331
00:20:34,923 --> 00:20:39,184
And I grouped them as internal and external ones.

332
00:20:40,425 --> 00:20:41,545
Let's go with the internal ones.

333
00:20:42,649 --> 00:20:46,113
So you've got an idea, you've got the money,

334
00:20:46,133 --> 00:20:47,715
and you've also got some deadlines.

335
00:20:48,476 --> 00:20:50,338
All you need is to have the right people

336
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,362
on the project immediately.

337
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:56,326
Sounds familiar to someone or not?

338
00:20:58,485 --> 00:21:02,946
We are opening positions, enhancing recruitment, looking for the best people.

339
00:21:03,867 --> 00:21:06,608
But recruitment is taking a lot of time.

340
00:21:07,568 --> 00:21:12,650
And it's not always so easy to convince people to join you when you are creating a new AP.

341
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:17,212
When you don't have a proper branding, when you don't have the proper label.

342
00:21:17,972 --> 00:21:23,734
So the fact was that we did not keep the right pace when it comes to the recruitment.

343
00:21:23,962 --> 00:21:25,882
And it's not because we didn't want to, yes.

344
00:21:26,483 --> 00:21:29,544
It was really hard to leverage this recruitment

345
00:21:29,624 --> 00:21:33,085
and have the equal onboardings along the time.

346
00:21:34,366 --> 00:21:36,027
But let's assume that we have the people

347
00:21:36,047 --> 00:21:41,149
that's on board, yes, but you need to think

348
00:21:41,189 --> 00:21:45,331
how to compose your teams and who should lead them.

349
00:21:46,231 --> 00:21:49,252
This is the next issue because you are creating

350
00:21:49,592 --> 00:21:51,573
more and more teams, having more and more people.

351
00:21:52,649 --> 00:21:58,693
That's a tricky one actually, because not every senior developer wants to be a lead.

352
00:21:59,694 --> 00:22:03,356
Some of them just want to be a principal and still do their job.

353
00:22:04,577 --> 00:22:08,740
On the other hand, not every candidate for a lead has the right skills to lead.

354
00:22:10,421 --> 00:22:16,465
So, we are experiencing that during couple of years and learning.

355
00:22:18,912 --> 00:22:24,415
And we found out that being a lead is a great responsibility and you need to be prepared

356
00:22:25,216 --> 00:22:31,080
Or you need to prepare your best people to play this role. Otherwise, you'll receive a random outcome

357
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:36,804
I'm not saying it's always gonna be bad. Yes. It's gonna be just a random outcome. It might be good

358
00:22:37,024 --> 00:22:41,687
It might be bad as well. And this is strictly related with your back office

359
00:22:42,467 --> 00:22:47,531
processes. Scaling up the headcount without scaling internal processes will lead you to

360
00:22:48,312 --> 00:22:53,696
failure in the long term. You need to learn how to decentralize structure,

361
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:59,020
delegate the responsibilities, delegate responsibilities and make sure that the project

362
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,062
team understands the big picture.

363
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:08,631
And leadership there is the crucial one here.

364
00:23:09,612 --> 00:23:11,253
So when it comes to the back office,

365
00:23:11,413 --> 00:23:13,874
we have this mission statement inside of the company

366
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:18,777
that the back office team should enable the work,

367
00:23:19,438 --> 00:23:22,860
the environment to create the best games for our developers.

368
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,161
As they are not working for themselves,

369
00:23:25,401 --> 00:23:26,502
I mean the back office team,

370
00:23:27,042 --> 00:23:29,684
they're working to support our developers

371
00:23:29,744 --> 00:23:31,245
inside of the company.

372
00:23:32,863 --> 00:23:35,025
So that's about the internal factors.

373
00:23:37,186 --> 00:23:40,068
But let's keep for a moment this narration

374
00:23:40,108 --> 00:23:43,430
that the recruitment is going extremely slowly,

375
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:44,971
but they need people.

376
00:23:45,731 --> 00:23:47,452
So what are you doing then?

377
00:23:48,453 --> 00:23:51,895
Of course, you are calling for outsource parties.

378
00:23:53,852 --> 00:23:58,253
And we did it as well, to be honest.

379
00:23:59,213 --> 00:24:07,516
I think that in the peak, we were cooperating with more than 200 or 300 people from the

380
00:24:07,676 --> 00:24:08,077
outsource.

381
00:24:09,617 --> 00:24:14,879
And don't get me wrong, it's nothing bad to collaborate with the outsource.

382
00:24:15,959 --> 00:24:20,581
We have a great partnership still today, but you need to do it smartly.

383
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:27,786
Based on our experience, we formulated three rules when it comes to outsourcing.

384
00:24:28,487 --> 00:24:33,932
The first one, the most fundamental one, build a strong relationship with the third party.

385
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:37,531
That's a key to success.

386
00:24:38,172 --> 00:24:42,995
Try to have the regular and frequent catch ups with your partners on a different management

387
00:24:43,035 --> 00:24:43,355
levels.

388
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:44,256
This is really important.

389
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:48,178
Don't speak only with the business partner because they will tell you, yeah, it's awesome,

390
00:24:48,238 --> 00:24:50,160
it's great, we're doing a great job.

391
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:56,164
But do not forget about them because their perspective is also important.

392
00:24:56,184 --> 00:24:59,225
So you cannot only focus on the development.

393
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:06,524
team. It's really important to understand each other, yes, and define the clear goals and

394
00:25:06,584 --> 00:25:14,989
expectations when it comes to the outsourcing. If these elements are not present, we as a company,

395
00:25:15,189 --> 00:25:20,172
we are not continuing the collaboration. And I'm completely honest here with you, we get some

396
00:25:20,192 --> 00:25:28,577
situations where if we couldn't build the relationship, we were just closing the contract.

397
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:37,151
So the second one, try to outsource repetitive tasks or end-to-end components.

398
00:25:38,413 --> 00:25:42,578
That's really important. This rule will help you mitigate the risk,

399
00:25:43,379 --> 00:25:48,244
save costs and let your team do other more creative tasks.

400
00:25:49,655 --> 00:25:52,717
A good example of typical repetitive tasks

401
00:25:52,857 --> 00:25:56,719
are quality tests, some code re-implementation,

402
00:25:56,999 --> 00:26:00,561
bug fixing, or even porting the game

403
00:26:01,362 --> 00:26:02,582
to a different platform, yes,

404
00:26:03,043 --> 00:26:06,104
if you treat it as an end-to-end process.

405
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:09,866
And the third one, which correlates to the second,

406
00:26:10,687 --> 00:26:16,990
try to not outsource complex or key issues for your game.

407
00:26:18,374 --> 00:26:19,895
Or maybe leave it as a last resort.

408
00:26:21,777 --> 00:26:23,598
It's all about risk management here

409
00:26:24,199 --> 00:26:26,421
and building the knowledge inside of your company.

410
00:26:26,941 --> 00:26:29,283
We wanted to be sure that every major issue can

411
00:26:29,343 --> 00:26:31,005
be handled in-house.

412
00:26:32,666 --> 00:26:34,388
So if a given feature or a system

413
00:26:34,488 --> 00:26:37,391
is one of our game's pillars, we wanted

414
00:26:37,431 --> 00:26:39,072
to have knowledge of how it was done.

415
00:26:39,593 --> 00:26:42,175
And the best way to have it is to do it by your own.

416
00:26:43,383 --> 00:26:45,884
Of course, there are some expectations

417
00:26:45,984 --> 00:26:48,445
or a specific plot of circumstances

418
00:26:48,485 --> 00:26:51,366
that will make your want to outsource that

419
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:54,527
and then try to go back to that work,

420
00:26:55,627 --> 00:26:58,428
try to go back to the work sooner than later.

421
00:26:59,248 --> 00:27:01,809
We learn it through the development.

422
00:27:04,241 --> 00:27:08,585
And from now, I should rather say from two years,

423
00:27:09,246 --> 00:27:10,907
we are paying a lot of attention

424
00:27:11,007 --> 00:27:14,170
to develop key features in-house.

425
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:16,051
Do not outsource them.

426
00:27:18,894 --> 00:27:21,536
You will learn about it during shipping phase, yes,

427
00:27:21,836 --> 00:27:25,059
when there is a lot of bug fixing stuff.

428
00:27:27,561 --> 00:27:27,821
Cool.

429
00:27:30,343 --> 00:27:32,905
The fifth one, the black swan.

430
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:38,900
I guess that some of you know the black swan definition,

431
00:27:39,821 --> 00:27:41,802
but I will bring it to you.

432
00:27:42,522 --> 00:27:46,024
This definition was formulated by Nassim Nicholas Taleb

433
00:27:46,805 --> 00:27:49,627
and describes an extremely negative event

434
00:27:49,807 --> 00:27:54,209
or occurrence that is impossibly difficult to predict.

435
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:58,432
In other words, black swan events are events

436
00:27:58,472 --> 00:28:01,694
that are unexpected and unknowable.

437
00:28:03,878 --> 00:28:08,180
And we've got some attributes outlined to this event,

438
00:28:09,201 --> 00:28:09,761
three of them.

439
00:28:10,442 --> 00:28:12,463
The first one is a black swan event

440
00:28:12,523 --> 00:28:14,965
is an event that is unpredictable, as I said before.

441
00:28:15,605 --> 00:28:18,066
A black swan event results in severe

442
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:19,567
and widespread consequences.

443
00:28:20,508 --> 00:28:21,128
And the third one,

444
00:28:22,229 --> 00:28:24,170
after the occurrence of the black swan event,

445
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:28,753
people will rationalize the event as having been predictable,

446
00:28:29,973 --> 00:28:33,075
which is known as a hindsight bias.

447
00:28:35,176 --> 00:28:40,558
I would like to share with you four of those events that we met during the production.

448
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:49,802
The first one, a model example of a black swan event is the COVID-19 situation.

449
00:28:51,002 --> 00:28:52,563
I guess that this is common to all of us.

450
00:28:53,543 --> 00:28:56,146
because all of us had to deal with it.

451
00:28:57,007 --> 00:28:58,368
So I will not speak a lot about it.

452
00:28:59,689 --> 00:29:02,452
But in our case, the pandemic started in a moment

453
00:29:03,092 --> 00:29:08,137
when we were preparing ourselves for the game release.

454
00:29:08,417 --> 00:29:11,040
So it was a very crucial moment.

455
00:29:13,462 --> 00:29:15,464
And as you can imagine, it's really helping,

456
00:29:15,644 --> 00:29:17,425
and it's more efficient, I guess,

457
00:29:17,886 --> 00:29:19,347
when you have your team on site.

458
00:29:21,008 --> 00:29:23,069
And when they can collaborate with each other,

459
00:29:23,089 --> 00:29:27,050
then when they are just dislocated in many locations

460
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:29,210
and trying to download the build,

461
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:31,831
having the poor internet connection and so on.

462
00:29:33,251 --> 00:29:35,652
So as others, we had to overcome this challenge

463
00:29:36,412 --> 00:29:38,693
and get things done and move forward.

464
00:29:39,593 --> 00:29:41,274
Was it unpredictable?

465
00:29:41,954 --> 00:29:43,134
Yes, it was.

466
00:29:45,301 --> 00:29:47,442
It was a game changer, yes, not only for us,

467
00:29:47,522 --> 00:29:50,362
not only for the game industry, but for the whole world.

468
00:29:51,863 --> 00:29:54,763
But could we prevent it somehow?

469
00:29:54,863 --> 00:29:55,743
Could we be prepared?

470
00:29:56,444 --> 00:29:57,844
Yeah, I guess we could, yes,

471
00:29:58,124 --> 00:30:02,125
but we didn't work remotely previously in our company.

472
00:30:02,945 --> 00:30:03,305
Why not?

473
00:30:04,125 --> 00:30:04,565
I don't know.

474
00:30:04,985 --> 00:30:07,326
Maybe we didn't have this need before.

475
00:30:09,446 --> 00:30:10,067
The second one.

476
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:14,730
Very interesting. Next Gen and Crossplay.

477
00:30:15,832 --> 00:30:18,518
Now maybe it's not literally the Black Swan event,

478
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:21,904
but in our case for a couple of years it was.

479
00:30:23,007 --> 00:30:27,870
Originally we were planning to release the game on nowadays old generation platforms,

480
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:35,453
but as you already know from what I said, the project had some delay,

481
00:30:36,214 --> 00:30:39,295
and we had to make a strategic decision along with our publisher.

482
00:30:39,956 --> 00:30:44,698
Do we want to release the game now and later prepare the patch for the next gen?

483
00:30:44,938 --> 00:30:46,579
Or maybe we want to risk?

484
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:50,388
postpone the project for the next couple of months,

485
00:30:50,688 --> 00:30:53,850
increase the budget, and meet the new expectations.

486
00:30:55,011 --> 00:30:57,292
So, the same story was with the cross-play,

487
00:30:58,453 --> 00:31:03,357
which became very popular around our original release date,

488
00:31:03,937 --> 00:31:06,839
and we decided, yeah, we didn't plan to make it,

489
00:31:06,939 --> 00:31:08,780
but since it is very popular,

490
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:11,022
maybe we should have it inside of our game.

491
00:31:12,303 --> 00:31:16,545
and it was 2019 or 20 I guess,

492
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:21,028
that we made this decision that we are going with these two things

493
00:31:21,568 --> 00:31:25,070
and had to change the whole production plan once again,

494
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:27,411
but it wasn't the biggest issue.

495
00:31:28,372 --> 00:31:32,054
Yes, we decided to take the chance and invest more time in production,

496
00:31:32,975 --> 00:31:36,557
but I guess that we did not expect such consequences

497
00:31:37,117 --> 00:31:38,518
when it comes to the tech side.

498
00:31:41,944 --> 00:31:44,805
I mean integrating our code to the newest UE,

499
00:31:45,466 --> 00:31:48,528
updates, new SDKs, GDKs, and so on.

500
00:31:49,268 --> 00:31:50,249
Once we thought we were done,

501
00:31:50,269 --> 00:31:53,131
a new update was coming,

502
00:31:53,331 --> 00:31:55,372
and some unexpected problems occurred.

503
00:31:56,132 --> 00:31:59,395
So we have to make the next iteration,

504
00:31:59,415 --> 00:32:01,636
and so on, and so on, for a couple of times.

505
00:32:02,456 --> 00:32:05,638
The frustration inside of the team was really huge.

506
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:12,523
On the other hand, we were very motivated to finish the work.

507
00:32:13,544 --> 00:32:17,768
And after all, it was worth doing that, definitely.

508
00:32:18,388 --> 00:32:20,309
Not only we gained a lot of experience,

509
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:22,031
which we are using right now,

510
00:32:22,091 --> 00:32:26,374
but also we used the opportunity to be the one

511
00:32:26,414 --> 00:32:29,116
of the very first game ready to be released along

512
00:32:29,717 --> 00:32:31,518
with new generation of consoles

513
00:32:31,998 --> 00:32:34,340
and ready for the cross-play for many, many platforms.

514
00:32:36,657 --> 00:32:37,618
Was it unpredictable?

515
00:32:38,639 --> 00:32:42,802
Yeah, somehow, because we didn't plan it.

516
00:32:42,862 --> 00:32:45,784
The consequences, as I said, engine updates

517
00:32:46,945 --> 00:32:48,326
at the very end of the production.

518
00:32:48,346 --> 00:32:52,329
And the question is, why we didn't plan it?

519
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:55,892
It's so obvious that we could go with that.

520
00:32:57,873 --> 00:33:00,555
Let's go with the third one then, the demo.

521
00:33:03,417 --> 00:33:05,839
I will reveal a secret to you.

522
00:33:06,937 --> 00:33:11,540
Originally, we did not plan to release the demo, period.

523
00:33:12,941 --> 00:33:14,962
But taking under consideration the first

524
00:33:15,062 --> 00:33:18,184
and the second Black Swan that I was talking about,

525
00:33:19,025 --> 00:33:21,727
we came to an idea that we need to prove somehow

526
00:33:21,787 --> 00:33:25,289
to our community that we are reliable

527
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:28,531
and that they can expect a great game

528
00:33:28,771 --> 00:33:32,514
that will be made by us in the upcoming future.

529
00:33:33,514 --> 00:33:42,177
So I remember that in September we made that decision together with Square that we are releasing the demo, that we want to launch it.

530
00:33:42,917 --> 00:33:45,858
And in February it was released.

531
00:33:46,738 --> 00:33:51,340
And we really received the great sentiment from the community.

532
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,340
But it cost us a lot.

533
00:33:54,335 --> 00:33:58,197
as it was yet another project being done in the parallel

534
00:33:58,677 --> 00:34:00,679
together with the main game.

535
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,101
We had to maintain the demo, yes,

536
00:34:04,161 --> 00:34:08,463
we released several patches just to the demo.

537
00:34:09,124 --> 00:34:11,445
And a couple of more intensive days

538
00:34:12,346 --> 00:34:14,887
we had to spend at work, yes,

539
00:34:14,987 --> 00:34:16,909
but we are very happy with the outcome.

540
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:24,022
And furthermore, the demo version gave us a lot of telemetry data, so it was really good to do.

541
00:34:26,363 --> 00:34:30,485
But you're not able to gather it through the regular testing, yes, because it's not the same

542
00:34:30,565 --> 00:34:36,447
scale. And I believe that thanks to that we also managed to improve the overall quality of the game

543
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:43,130
just before it was released. So once again, it was unpredictable for us because we didn't plan it.

544
00:34:45,694 --> 00:34:49,096
We had to do additional life of stuff

545
00:34:49,416 --> 00:34:50,896
related to the demo.

546
00:34:52,797 --> 00:34:54,237
But we can ask ourselves, yes.

547
00:34:54,797 --> 00:34:55,398
Did we plan it?

548
00:34:55,458 --> 00:34:56,838
Yes, we could, yes.

549
00:34:57,778 --> 00:34:58,559
Why we didn't do that?

550
00:34:59,939 --> 00:35:01,019
And the last one, guys.

551
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,081
Unexpected, beep, beep, beep, beep,

552
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:07,702
untraceable bugs.

553
00:35:10,419 --> 00:35:12,141
This is the last event I want to share with you,

554
00:35:12,161 --> 00:35:15,606
and it was strictly related to the inventory wipeout

555
00:35:15,886 --> 00:35:16,607
and disconnects.

556
00:35:17,028 --> 00:35:18,250
Those of you who played the game

557
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:25,079
probably had a bad experience with this stuff.

558
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,340
But after the release, the overall reception

559
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,281
of the game was quite good.

560
00:35:29,641 --> 00:35:33,802
However, there were two offenders, one by one,

561
00:35:33,862 --> 00:35:38,503
that were not able to track during the shipping by us.

562
00:35:38,983 --> 00:35:41,024
Yes, we wasn't able to track them.

563
00:35:41,504 --> 00:35:44,625
Even the beta test that we had did not reveal

564
00:35:44,665 --> 00:35:47,546
the issues that I'm speaking about.

565
00:35:48,366 --> 00:35:51,608
Maybe, you know, there was some random cases in between,

566
00:35:51,628 --> 00:35:54,190
but yeah, they were just random.

567
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:57,192
So, unfortunately, we exposed our players

568
00:35:57,212 --> 00:35:58,332
to the very bad experience,

569
00:35:59,813 --> 00:36:01,234
and we are still very sorry for that,

570
00:36:01,714 --> 00:36:03,796
but trust me that once we discovered these bugs,

571
00:36:04,739 --> 00:36:07,220
And the community confirmed us about the issue,

572
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,441
as the studio were working in a 24-7 regime

573
00:36:11,162 --> 00:36:12,623
in order to fix it.

574
00:36:13,363 --> 00:36:15,664
And once again, I would like to thank,

575
00:36:16,044 --> 00:36:18,186
once again, I would like to thank you for helping us,

576
00:36:18,566 --> 00:36:20,627
I mean the community, with targeting these bugs,

577
00:36:21,287 --> 00:36:23,408
especially the one related to the inventory.

578
00:36:24,439 --> 00:36:29,802
We did not predict it, so yeah, it was unpredictable for us,

579
00:36:30,863 --> 00:36:35,606
and did not find it despite the countless hours of testing.

580
00:36:36,306 --> 00:36:37,967
The impact of the event was enormous,

581
00:36:38,567 --> 00:36:44,651
and once we found it, the reason for that was very obvious.

582
00:36:44,771 --> 00:36:49,034
And we ask ourselves, yes, why we couldn't develop it

583
00:36:49,094 --> 00:36:49,814
in a different way?

584
00:36:50,781 --> 00:36:52,182
It was so obvious, yeah.

585
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,042
But now we know it.

586
00:36:54,903 --> 00:36:56,783
So I can assure you with the one thing,

587
00:36:57,904 --> 00:36:59,304
that the longer is your project,

588
00:36:59,985 --> 00:37:03,366
the more likely you will meet a black swan event.

589
00:37:05,527 --> 00:37:06,927
You cannot be fully prepared for that.

590
00:37:07,547 --> 00:37:11,369
However, you can mitigate the outcomes and learn on it.

591
00:37:12,995 --> 00:37:16,783
And in a moment, I will give you a hint how to deal with it.

592
00:37:17,745 --> 00:37:21,272
So we will move to the last chapter,

593
00:37:22,013 --> 00:37:24,438
to the contingency theory.

594
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,881
This is the last definition I've got for you today,

595
00:37:29,041 --> 00:37:31,442
and I promise it will be the end of the lecture,

596
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:34,544
but you will be ready to pass the certificate

597
00:37:34,644 --> 00:37:38,105
after having this definition explained by me.

598
00:37:38,945 --> 00:37:42,147
So I guess that many of you heard about black swan even,

599
00:37:42,247 --> 00:37:44,668
but I'm not so sure when it comes to contingency theory.

600
00:37:45,528 --> 00:37:48,189
It was formulated more than 70 years ago

601
00:37:48,929 --> 00:37:50,570
in Chicago University.

602
00:37:51,591 --> 00:37:56,753
A contingency theory is an organizational theory that claims that there is no best way

603
00:37:56,813 --> 00:38:02,316
to organize a corporation, to lead a company or to make decisions.

604
00:38:03,297 --> 00:38:06,919
Instead, the optimal course of action is contingent.

605
00:38:07,647 --> 00:38:11,627
means dependent upon the internal and external situation.

606
00:38:12,427 --> 00:38:15,988
So contingent leaders are flexible in choosing

607
00:38:16,068 --> 00:38:18,629
and adopting the Saxon strategies

608
00:38:18,669 --> 00:38:20,849
to suit the changing situation

609
00:38:21,749 --> 00:38:23,129
at a particular period in time

610
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:25,590
in the running of the organization.

611
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:32,571
And a couple of sentences here as well.

612
00:38:32,971 --> 00:38:34,532
Contingency theorists would say

613
00:38:34,572 --> 00:38:36,592
that no matter how successful a leader is.

614
00:38:37,896 --> 00:38:40,218
there will always be a particular situation

615
00:38:40,258 --> 00:38:41,439
that will challenge them,

616
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,721
which is really, really important.

617
00:38:45,422 --> 00:38:48,905
And true fact is that contingency theory

618
00:38:49,185 --> 00:38:52,187
was checked by many others

619
00:38:52,948 --> 00:38:57,351
and no one was able to failure this definition.

620
00:38:58,032 --> 00:38:59,653
It is still valid.

621
00:39:01,655 --> 00:39:02,776
But let's try to

622
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:10,864
Let's try to adapt this contingency theory into game development.

623
00:39:12,126 --> 00:39:18,333
So, the first statement that I have for you is that there is no way to lead a complex project.

624
00:39:18,873 --> 00:39:21,276
I mean the AAA project.

625
00:39:22,157 --> 00:39:25,681
Different genres and business models require different leadership.

626
00:39:27,501 --> 00:39:30,604
And when your game is a live service,

627
00:39:31,144 --> 00:39:34,187
probably you'll put more effort on telemetry,

628
00:39:34,667 --> 00:39:36,989
feedback studies, or expectations,

629
00:39:38,271 --> 00:39:39,652
expectations management.

630
00:39:40,492 --> 00:39:42,274
You'll need a different approach

631
00:39:42,314 --> 00:39:44,056
to test complex RPG-like games,

632
00:39:44,116 --> 00:39:45,237
and a different one when it comes

633
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:46,638
to the shooter games, and so on.

634
00:39:47,579 --> 00:39:50,822
So, once again, there is no one way to lead a project.

635
00:39:52,649 --> 00:39:58,151
there is no one leadership style that will work in all cases.

636
00:40:00,792 --> 00:40:07,414
So we know right now, being a global company, that depending on the region, culture,

637
00:40:07,674 --> 00:40:11,976
country, experience, relationship, insight, and between your teams,

638
00:40:13,196 --> 00:40:18,138
you should use specific methods and practices to manage work and engage the people.

639
00:40:18,418 --> 00:40:19,438
There is no one way to do this.

640
00:40:20,375 --> 00:40:25,560
Sometimes your goal will be to inspire your team and to give them a lot of freedom.

641
00:40:26,221 --> 00:40:29,164
Another time you will expect discipline.

642
00:40:30,906 --> 00:40:35,410
You'll be sharper and more tenacious when it comes to the negotiations and so on.

643
00:40:36,411 --> 00:40:42,678
But the bottom line here is that you need to have the right skills to play all these different roles.

644
00:40:43,771 --> 00:40:47,999
which is extremely difficult and probably even not possible to do.

645
00:40:48,901 --> 00:40:51,186
That is why some leaders fail.

646
00:40:52,518 --> 00:40:55,260
because they want to do everything on their own

647
00:40:56,080 --> 00:41:02,404
and make every single decision on their own.

648
00:41:03,784 --> 00:41:05,625
Other leaders, yes,

649
00:41:05,745 --> 00:41:08,067
they learn how to delegate responsibilities,

650
00:41:09,127 --> 00:41:11,248
but delegation and responsibility

651
00:41:11,268 --> 00:41:15,550
is a quite different story for today's talk.

652
00:41:17,491 --> 00:41:18,772
And the third, the last one.

653
00:41:20,697 --> 00:41:23,759
There is no one perfect methodology

654
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,422
to manage the whole project.

655
00:41:27,042 --> 00:41:28,243
There is no silver bullet.

656
00:41:28,784 --> 00:41:30,806
And we are going back to this phase two

657
00:41:30,846 --> 00:41:31,807
with the question mark.

658
00:41:33,028 --> 00:41:35,910
Why we had this question mark for the phase two?

659
00:41:36,151 --> 00:41:38,293
Because there is no obvious answer for that.

660
00:41:41,395 --> 00:41:44,738
And let me elaborate on that a little bit more.

661
00:41:46,674 --> 00:41:51,499
Once again, I will display this and chart with the processes.

662
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:54,562
And I strongly believe that each of these phases

663
00:41:55,363 --> 00:41:58,146
needs a separate management approach.

664
00:41:59,187 --> 00:42:00,568
I don't know if you were present,

665
00:42:00,748 --> 00:42:03,731
but I really enjoyed listening to Ben from 47 on Monday.

666
00:42:05,533 --> 00:42:08,515
when he was speaking about the hybrid of Agile and Waterfall

667
00:42:10,036 --> 00:42:11,176
in the game development.

668
00:42:11,957 --> 00:42:15,219
And I agree with him that no two projects are the same.

669
00:42:19,469 --> 00:42:20,971
And there is no way to decide,

670
00:42:22,152 --> 00:42:23,694
sorry, you need to decide how to tailor

671
00:42:23,714 --> 00:42:27,099
a production framework for your own.

672
00:42:27,159 --> 00:42:31,304
Yes, at PCF we managed to create the framework,

673
00:42:32,105 --> 00:42:34,248
our own framework that we are using right now.

674
00:42:34,808 --> 00:42:37,492
And yeah, it is a mix between Agile and Waterfall.

675
00:42:41,487 --> 00:42:44,549
So I do believe that when it comes to the first two phases,

676
00:42:44,949 --> 00:42:48,492
concept and pre-production, they are more creative one.

677
00:42:48,952 --> 00:42:51,133
And if we are speaking about the creativity,

678
00:42:51,274 --> 00:42:53,935
if we are speaking about the iterating and failing fast,

679
00:42:54,696 --> 00:42:57,738
it's always good to choose the agile methods here.

680
00:42:57,978 --> 00:42:59,619
Maybe Scrum, maybe something else.

681
00:43:00,546 --> 00:43:01,848
When it's going to the production,

682
00:43:02,348 --> 00:43:04,150
you want to be repetitive.

683
00:43:04,351 --> 00:43:06,373
Yes, you are scaling up the things

684
00:43:06,413 --> 00:43:09,177
that you've done previously and prove previously,

685
00:43:09,197 --> 00:43:13,121
and now we want to be really predictive

686
00:43:13,902 --> 00:43:16,265
and do the things in the constant velocity.

687
00:43:17,394 --> 00:43:21,137
Different approaches when you're trying to release the game,

688
00:43:21,217 --> 00:43:22,138
when you are shipping it,

689
00:43:23,079 --> 00:43:25,561
then you want to be very efficient, yes?

690
00:43:26,001 --> 00:43:28,103
The first two phases, I heard this sentence,

691
00:43:28,183 --> 00:43:30,225
the first two phases are being made by developers.

692
00:43:31,006 --> 00:43:33,308
The third one, I mean releasing,

693
00:43:33,388 --> 00:43:34,609
is being made by programmers.

694
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:37,932
Yes, because they are fixing bugs.

695
00:43:38,792 --> 00:43:42,575
So you need to give them the right transparency,

696
00:43:43,336 --> 00:43:46,118
the right information, what is important right now,

697
00:43:46,538 --> 00:43:49,641
and keep the velocity here.

698
00:43:50,401 --> 00:43:52,863
And the last phase, the post-production one,

699
00:43:53,584 --> 00:43:56,206
it's about being adaptable.

700
00:43:56,226 --> 00:43:57,687
Yes, you want to adapt to the feedback

701
00:43:57,727 --> 00:43:58,527
that you are receiving,

702
00:43:58,548 --> 00:44:03,651
and implement it in the best possible way.

703
00:44:06,058 --> 00:44:09,259
So yeah, let's go back to this contingency management again.

704
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:12,041
For example, during the production phase, as I said,

705
00:44:12,081 --> 00:44:14,882
you're experiencing this agile methodologies.

706
00:44:16,523 --> 00:44:20,505
And you will choose the best solution,

707
00:44:20,605 --> 00:44:22,025
the best tool for you.

708
00:44:22,706 --> 00:44:27,268
Try to be flexible, try to be agile here.

709
00:44:30,166 --> 00:44:33,831
And you know, the coolest thing is that you can check out

710
00:44:34,051 --> 00:44:38,236
everything I said by your own in our new expansion

711
00:44:38,576 --> 00:44:40,699
to Outriders, which will be released this year.

712
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:45,405
So stay tuned, check the Twitter, check the media.

713
00:44:46,046 --> 00:44:48,409
I think that information about that will be soon.

714
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:51,673
And I would like to thank you very much for being here

715
00:44:52,614 --> 00:44:55,398
with me, and I hope that you find this talk educational

716
00:44:55,499 --> 00:44:59,364
and interesting, and I kindly invite you

717
00:44:59,424 --> 00:45:01,768
to share your feedback using the survey,

718
00:45:01,828 --> 00:45:02,849
and if you have any questions,

719
00:45:02,929 --> 00:45:04,652
I'm more than happy to answer them.

720
00:45:05,333 --> 00:45:05,713
Thanks a lot.

721
00:45:17,627 --> 00:45:23,396
Hello, it was an awesome talk, very useful. I have one question.

722
00:45:23,476 --> 00:45:29,346
So, well, we are a very small studio and I was looking how you started and I'm like,

723
00:45:29,627 --> 00:45:30,909
wow, that's a big studio.

724
00:45:32,235 --> 00:45:39,802
We are four people and we were smaller and I am also an indie solo developer

725
00:45:40,282 --> 00:45:47,789
and I was meaning to ask, all this advice can be done scald for a very, very small

726
00:45:47,829 --> 00:45:51,392
studio or would you take special considerations?

727
00:45:52,668 --> 00:45:57,093
You know, I think that I will use a different method when it comes to the smaller scale,

728
00:45:58,075 --> 00:46:03,061
because having a smaller scale helps you to be more agile even,

729
00:46:03,681 --> 00:46:08,307
and you don't have to use those processes and formal stuff.

730
00:46:08,908 --> 00:46:13,010
because you can discuss everything, having each other as a one group.

731
00:46:13,631 --> 00:46:19,774
There's a different approach when you have, I don't know, 20 teams on your project

732
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:21,775
and when you have only one team.

733
00:46:21,815 --> 00:46:25,438
Yes, having 20 teams you need to manage the complexity and dependency.

734
00:46:26,198 --> 00:46:29,260
and also manage the communication, which is the hardest part.

735
00:46:29,741 --> 00:46:33,083
Having a smaller team, it is much more easier.

736
00:46:33,684 --> 00:46:37,706
Maybe I would just take the general approach,

737
00:46:38,987 --> 00:46:40,769
just seeing the big picture and so on,

738
00:46:41,449 --> 00:46:43,170
but use the less formal methods

739
00:46:43,771 --> 00:46:46,953
when it comes to the team management.

740
00:46:48,154 --> 00:46:48,614
Thank you.

741
00:46:48,774 --> 00:46:49,395
You're welcome.

742
00:46:54,459 --> 00:46:54,999
Yes, please.

743
00:46:56,742 --> 00:46:59,644
Yeah, hi Aram and thanks for the talk, it was really good and great.

744
00:47:00,864 --> 00:47:09,329
About the contingency, as it is a future event or circumstance which is possible but cannot

745
00:47:09,369 --> 00:47:17,594
be predicted with certainty, your three tips or three things which you are doing now to somehow

746
00:47:17,674 --> 00:47:22,917
prepare for it, because it's a little bit disrupting for me that I cannot predict this and prepare.

747
00:47:24,772 --> 00:47:28,718
You're saying about being prepared for something which we cannot predict?

748
00:47:28,738 --> 00:47:29,198
Uh-huh.

749
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:30,200
Ah, yeah.

750
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,081
Yeah, I said this.

751
00:47:31,121 --> 00:47:31,943
Yes.

752
00:47:32,043 --> 00:47:32,183
So...

753
00:47:36,851 --> 00:47:44,714
You know, it's truly about being prepared to do things which will stress your team.

754
00:47:45,034 --> 00:47:45,514
Yes, it's...

755
00:47:46,775 --> 00:47:52,557
The situations that I shared with you, all of them were some kind of stressful, yes,

756
00:47:52,657 --> 00:47:55,779
and we weren't used to them before.

757
00:47:56,319 --> 00:48:01,401
But you can prepare your team for the situations like that, saying them,

758
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:05,863
Hey, guys, right now we know how we need to, you know...

759
00:48:06,243 --> 00:48:10,145
group each other, that we need to speak more often,

760
00:48:10,945 --> 00:48:12,206
be more transparent, and so on.

761
00:48:12,526 --> 00:48:15,888
I mean by that, that when you are doing nothing,

762
00:48:16,728 --> 00:48:19,369
you will never be prepared for mitigating the risk.

763
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:23,051
If you are trying to collaborate with your team,

764
00:48:23,111 --> 00:48:25,773
and if you are trying to be close to them,

765
00:48:26,313 --> 00:48:29,915
it is much more easier to react on situations like death.

766
00:48:30,495 --> 00:48:32,516
That's just to feel the rhythm of your team.

767
00:48:32,976 --> 00:48:34,317
And I think that this is the only way,

768
00:48:34,337 --> 00:48:35,838
or at least the only one that I know.

769
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:42,128
to react to something that is unpredictable and unknowable for us.

770
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:44,872
Okay, thanks.

771
00:48:44,892 --> 00:48:45,834
You're welcome.

772
00:48:49,892 --> 00:48:50,633
Hey Adam, good talk.

773
00:48:51,153 --> 00:48:51,593
Thanks.

774
00:48:52,593 --> 00:48:55,275
I noticed a lot of similarities between Ben's talk

775
00:48:55,315 --> 00:48:57,396
and your talk with your pipeline and schedule.

776
00:48:58,076 --> 00:48:59,356
What I thought was really interesting

777
00:48:59,396 --> 00:49:02,518
was the first playable before the vertical slice.

778
00:49:03,098 --> 00:49:05,159
So was that more just for first playable

779
00:49:05,179 --> 00:49:08,681
being a proof of concept of like product pillars

780
00:49:08,701 --> 00:49:11,702
or major features and then move into the vertical,

781
00:49:11,722 --> 00:49:12,422
you know what I'm saying?

782
00:49:12,902 --> 00:49:14,823
Yeah, I know, yeah, that's a good question.

783
00:49:15,344 --> 00:49:17,084
So you know, we are at People Can Fly,

784
00:49:19,035 --> 00:49:21,236
trying to show through the first playable build

785
00:49:21,896 --> 00:49:22,817
the idea for the game.

786
00:49:23,497 --> 00:49:25,658
So it doesn't matter if you're showing it

787
00:49:25,778 --> 00:49:27,339
at a white box level and so on,

788
00:49:27,779 --> 00:49:28,899
because we just want to prove,

789
00:49:29,239 --> 00:49:32,361
or mainly prove the core combat loop,

790
00:49:33,301 --> 00:49:35,082
because this is the key pillar

791
00:49:35,122 --> 00:49:37,483
when it comes to the shooter game.

792
00:49:38,043 --> 00:49:39,103
During the vertical slice,

793
00:49:40,964 --> 00:49:42,825
we have this definition that we want to prove

794
00:49:42,865 --> 00:49:45,026
the one hour of game, of the gameplay,

795
00:49:45,627 --> 00:49:49,088
showing every single aspect of the game

796
00:49:49,109 --> 00:49:50,709
during this one hour, yes?

797
00:49:51,390 --> 00:49:52,770
So different type of enemies,

798
00:49:52,931 --> 00:49:57,673
different type of skills, armors, weapons, and so on.

799
00:50:00,415 --> 00:50:00,595
Yeah.

800
00:50:07,288 --> 00:50:12,330
OK, thanks a lot once again, and enjoy the rest of your day.

801
00:50:12,770 --> 00:50:13,050
Thank you.

802
00:50:18,992 --> 00:50:20,853
CLAPPING
