1
00:00:06,397 --> 00:00:07,157
Hello, everybody.

2
00:00:08,177 --> 00:00:09,557
Welcome to our talk.

3
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:11,098
Thanks for coming.

4
00:00:12,258 --> 00:00:14,578
I just want to say I'm Tim Schafer, the president of

5
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:16,479
Double Fine Productions here in San Francisco.

6
00:00:16,919 --> 00:00:17,179
Thank you.

7
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:20,540
And I've come here today with several of our cohorts from

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,320
Double Fine to talk to you about a big change in our

9
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,901
production, the way we produce games that went over the last

10
00:00:26,941 --> 00:00:28,401
couple years at Double Fine and how it.

11
00:00:29,382 --> 00:00:32,202
some things we came up against and how we solved them.

12
00:00:32,963 --> 00:00:34,203
And it's called Creative Panic,

13
00:00:34,443 --> 00:00:36,284
How Agility Turned Terror Into Triumph.

14
00:00:36,744 --> 00:00:37,924
It's a beautiful slide, Lee.

15
00:00:38,124 --> 00:00:41,305
Thank you.

16
00:00:41,325 --> 00:00:42,185
I want to remind everyone,

17
00:00:43,305 --> 00:00:45,186
if your cell phone rings during this presentation,

18
00:00:45,206 --> 00:00:47,487
we will stop and restart from the very beginning.

19
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:50,671
even if we're like two minutes from the end. So

20
00:00:50,711 --> 00:00:55,218
please turn off your ringers. And they're, we all

21
00:00:55,238 --> 00:00:56,661
want to remind you to fill out your feedback

22
00:00:56,701 --> 00:00:58,804
forms, cause they are not actually forms anymore, so

23
00:00:58,824 --> 00:01:00,667
that's kind of misleading, that gesture. If you get

24
00:01:00,687 --> 00:01:02,470
your card, you land your.

25
00:01:02,997 --> 00:01:05,358
get your pass scanned by one of the CAs, they

26
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,539
will, you'll get an email asking you if you

27
00:01:07,559 --> 00:01:09,220
like this talk or not. I know it's hard

28
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:10,880
to give feedback like that. I would like to

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,022
recommend fives. If it's a, you know, scale of

30
00:01:14,082 --> 00:01:16,563
one to five or, or ten, I haven't really

31
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:18,663
seen them yet. So, just wanted, in case you

32
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:21,244
need to copy someone else's work, those are my

33
00:01:21,264 --> 00:01:22,565
suggestions for the ratings.

34
00:01:24,693 --> 00:01:25,774
That would have been a good slide to show

35
00:01:25,814 --> 00:01:27,096
while I was doing all that welcoming talk.

36
00:01:27,516 --> 00:01:28,537
Because we're gonna miss that right now.

37
00:01:29,938 --> 00:01:31,539
I am here to tell you, my friends,

38
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:32,760
that we are in crazy times.

39
00:01:32,981 --> 00:01:34,782
That these times we live in,

40
00:01:34,802 --> 00:01:36,163
there are a lot of big games out there.

41
00:01:36,967 --> 00:01:38,047
And that's a picture of me.

42
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:41,270
And we at Double Fine have made big games, and we

43
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:42,270
compete with big games.

44
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:43,771
But the games are just getting bigger.

45
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:44,972
They're getting bigger and more expensive.

46
00:01:45,012 --> 00:01:46,813
And they take that money, and they buy the top talent, and

47
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:48,534
the games get better and bigger.

48
00:01:48,574 --> 00:01:50,396
And it's like a snowball that keeps rolling.

49
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:53,358
It's very hard to compete against for smaller studios.

50
00:01:53,378 --> 00:01:56,280
But there are even the really small studios that also

51
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,662
compete in a way of being incredibly creative and taking

52
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:01,523
many, many years to make their games and not paying

53
00:02:01,543 --> 00:02:03,945
themselves any money and living out of their basements

54
00:02:03,965 --> 00:02:04,505
while they do that.

55
00:02:05,005 --> 00:02:08,306
And those are, those kind of studios are also very hard for a studio like Double Fine to

56
00:02:08,326 --> 00:02:11,547
compete with, because they have a lot of flexibility with the whole lack of payroll thing.

57
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:17,869
We've always been kind of an unusual studio in that we're, we're an independent developer,

58
00:02:17,909 --> 00:02:20,370
but we have health care, you know, somewhere, somewhere right in the middle.

59
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:23,851
We've been comfortable there, except for lately the, the phrase death of the middle has been

60
00:02:23,951 --> 00:02:25,591
going around, which makes us a little nervous.

61
00:02:26,171 --> 00:02:27,952
There aren't a lot of studios left in that middle space.

62
00:02:28,792 --> 00:02:29,773
And we did see...

63
00:02:31,123 --> 00:02:33,745
a lot of pressure, like things closing in on us in a way,

64
00:02:33,765 --> 00:02:35,567
when we're thinking about what game to make after

65
00:02:36,067 --> 00:02:36,668
Brutal Legend.

66
00:02:37,869 --> 00:02:39,730
It's getting harder and harder to sign big games like that,

67
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:42,132
and there's pressures that, even if you can sign them,

68
00:02:42,152 --> 00:02:43,874
make them maybe not what you want to sign.

69
00:02:43,954 --> 00:02:45,936
For example, publishers are very averse to new...

70
00:02:48,558 --> 00:02:49,619
Very versed in new IP.

71
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,421
When you're investing millions and millions of dollars, you'd

72
00:02:52,481 --> 00:02:54,743
rather place it on a license title or a SQL.

73
00:02:54,903 --> 00:02:56,244
It's in their defense.

74
00:02:56,304 --> 00:02:56,765
It makes sense.

75
00:02:58,306 --> 00:03:00,007
They also want to own the IP, which is something that

76
00:03:00,027 --> 00:03:00,768
Double Fine believes.

77
00:03:00,828 --> 00:03:02,829
Developers should own their own IP and not give it away to

78
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:03,250
publishers.

79
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,711
And yeah, you should remember to ask for that next time

80
00:03:04,731 --> 00:03:05,692
you're negotiating a contract.

81
00:03:07,705 --> 00:03:09,225
Because I think that's what leads to the best games.

82
00:03:09,285 --> 00:03:12,106
Developers care about their characters and worlds they're

83
00:03:12,126 --> 00:03:13,026
making, and it makes sense.

84
00:03:13,086 --> 00:03:14,726
But it's very hard to do that at these big

85
00:03:14,766 --> 00:03:16,306
budgets that are happening.

86
00:03:16,586 --> 00:03:18,967
And people giving you a lot of money to make a game also

87
00:03:19,127 --> 00:03:22,668
rightfully want to make it safe, make it a good return

88
00:03:22,688 --> 00:03:23,088
on their money.

89
00:03:23,128 --> 00:03:25,068
They want to take out the risks and unknowns.

90
00:03:25,108 --> 00:03:27,489
But Double Fine, the things that really excite us are

91
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:29,349
these risky things, these unknown doing something that

92
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:30,109
hasn't been done before.

93
00:03:30,149 --> 00:03:30,929
That's what makes it fun.

94
00:03:31,009 --> 00:03:33,310
So we saw this pressure to take out a lot of the things

95
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:36,090
that made games fun if we go for these bigger, bigger

96
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:36,290
games.

97
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:39,311
So how has Double Fine survived this kind of pressure?

98
00:03:40,151 --> 00:03:44,352
We spent 10 years as a one team studio making one game at a

99
00:03:44,412 --> 00:03:45,752
time, and I was always in charge of it.

100
00:03:45,812 --> 00:03:49,373
And it was very entrenched into our culture that that's

101
00:03:49,393 --> 00:03:50,154
the way we did things.

102
00:03:50,794 --> 00:03:52,114
But we managed to turn the battleship.

103
00:03:52,134 --> 00:03:53,454
This is a phrase I learned at LucasArts.

104
00:03:53,494 --> 00:03:56,315
Every time there was a new president or a layoff or a new

105
00:03:56,355 --> 00:03:57,135
president with a layoff.

106
00:03:58,155 --> 00:03:59,776
would be a big meeting, and the first thing

107
00:03:59,816 --> 00:04:01,376
he'd say is like, we're gonna turn the battleship,

108
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:04,417
everybody. Which sounded really exciting. Not that, I mean,

109
00:04:04,437 --> 00:04:06,017
it's probably the boring, most boring thing a battleship

110
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,137
could do, is turn around. But, I mean.

111
00:04:09,098 --> 00:04:11,478
So we did manage to turn the battleship into

112
00:04:11,498 --> 00:04:14,379
a fleet of tug boats. Didn't see that coming.

113
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:17,840
Or, like, bigger, sexier, like, cigarette boats from Miami

114
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,920
Vice, with guns on them. Just awesome boats.

115
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:24,281
And we did that by using Amnesia Fortnight. Many of

116
00:04:24,301 --> 00:04:26,302
you know Amnesia Fortnight is a psychedelic mushroom, and

117
00:04:26,322 --> 00:04:27,782
we all took it, and it gave us the idea.

118
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:38,084
Now, Amnesia Fortnight is something that came up when we were thinking about, I heard a

119
00:04:38,104 --> 00:04:42,067
story about a filmmaker in Hong Kong named Wong Kar-wai who was making Ashes of Time.

120
00:04:42,087 --> 00:04:45,230
It was this huge three-year production and his team was getting really, you know, they're

121
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,872
spending a lot of time in the desert, getting really oppressed by this huge production.

122
00:04:47,892 --> 00:04:51,015
And so he took his star and his cinematographer and they went to Hong Kong and they improvised

123
00:04:51,075 --> 00:04:55,258
a bunch of dialogue that later turned into Chungking Express and Fallen Angels, two completely

124
00:04:55,278 --> 00:04:58,301
different movies that were actually really, really some of the most famous movies.

125
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:00,423
and it was a great break for his team.

126
00:05:00,443 --> 00:05:02,104
And I thought, that's a great idea.

127
00:05:02,164 --> 00:05:02,665
We should do that.

128
00:05:02,725 --> 00:05:03,526
It's right in the middle of Brutal.

129
00:05:04,046 --> 00:05:04,687
We could use a break.

130
00:05:05,007 --> 00:05:07,990
And it's called Amnesia because you totally forget

131
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,872
what you're working on for two weeks.

132
00:05:09,932 --> 00:05:11,193
Forget about Brutal Legend for two weeks

133
00:05:11,293 --> 00:05:12,734
and we'll just work on something else.

134
00:05:13,075 --> 00:05:13,755
It's called Fortnite.

135
00:05:13,835 --> 00:05:14,256
I don't know why.

136
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:19,773
because it was two weeks. Some companies have done this also, and they do it for one week.

137
00:05:19,793 --> 00:05:23,675
For some reason, I really believe two weeks is the right amount of time. We broke the

138
00:05:23,695 --> 00:05:28,718
whole company into smaller teams. Sorry, this picture makes me laugh.

139
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,723
And we gave each, we had a 60 person team for Brutal,

140
00:05:34,743 --> 00:05:35,884
and we split it into four groups,

141
00:05:36,485 --> 00:05:38,546
and each of those groups had to make a game in two weeks.

142
00:05:38,907 --> 00:05:40,508
And we really wanted it to be a complete experience,

143
00:05:40,568 --> 00:05:42,269
which meant not just like a demo of like,

144
00:05:42,289 --> 00:05:43,150
here's a guy walking around,

145
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,512
imagine he's in a great world, or imagine, you know,

146
00:05:45,532 --> 00:05:47,874
but really, even if it's a small little slice of gameplay,

147
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:49,295
make it complete, like a beginning and middle,

148
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,157
and let us feel what this game is gonna feel like

149
00:05:51,197 --> 00:05:51,878
that you guys are making.

150
00:05:53,224 --> 00:05:54,805
And it was massive success, I think.

151
00:05:55,086 --> 00:05:56,126
I think for the following reasons.

152
00:05:56,186 --> 00:05:57,828
It gave us a big morale boost.

153
00:05:57,868 --> 00:05:59,409
Everyone on the team loved,

154
00:05:59,429 --> 00:06:00,570
I was walking down the hallway

155
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,931
and I could just feel people being excited

156
00:06:01,951 --> 00:06:03,792
about what they're working on in a whole new way.

157
00:06:03,852 --> 00:06:05,754
There was four new ideas going on at the company

158
00:06:05,794 --> 00:06:07,175
and people were trying new things.

159
00:06:07,195 --> 00:06:10,858
And everyone, it was just, it was great on that level

160
00:06:10,898 --> 00:06:12,339
that everyone was really excited.

161
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:14,921
And people got to try out new roles.

162
00:06:14,961 --> 00:06:16,462
I think this is Drew Skillman trying out

163
00:06:16,482 --> 00:06:17,983
the new role of God, was that what you're?

164
00:06:19,466 --> 00:06:21,447
People get to try out new roles.

165
00:06:21,467 --> 00:06:24,629
Because when you have one production, one team, and you

166
00:06:24,669 --> 00:06:26,190
have me as a creative director, you have one lead

167
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:28,052
programmer, and you have one lead artist and a designer,

168
00:06:28,072 --> 00:06:31,294
and there's not a lot of room for people to move up in that

169
00:06:31,354 --> 00:06:35,276
unless I'm dead or get killed or fired or something.

170
00:06:35,336 --> 00:06:39,459
So in order to avoid being killed, we started this whole

171
00:06:39,719 --> 00:06:39,859
process.

172
00:06:42,257 --> 00:06:44,597
So people got to, with four teams, we had four leads,

173
00:06:44,657 --> 00:06:46,018
and four lead programmers, four lead artists,

174
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:48,279
and people got to, modelers got to try concept art,

175
00:06:48,299 --> 00:06:49,939
because it was just like a two-week thing.

176
00:06:49,999 --> 00:06:51,280
Everybody, no rules.

177
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:51,840
Anyway.

178
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,200
And we actually ended up with usable game ideas.

179
00:06:54,441 --> 00:06:55,801
We actually ended up with these little demos

180
00:06:55,841 --> 00:06:57,221
that we said, wow, this is really fun.

181
00:06:57,461 --> 00:06:59,502
We could actually ship this or something like it.

182
00:07:00,623 --> 00:07:02,523
And also, as a side benefit, it also saved the company.

183
00:07:04,284 --> 00:07:05,324
Which I love when that happens.

184
00:07:08,305 --> 00:07:11,646
How did that happen? Why did it save the company? Well, we did it twice. First, we did it in

185
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:15,827
the middle of Brutal Legend in production. We took a break and we did the first initial

186
00:07:15,847 --> 00:07:20,368
Fortnite project. And we did four teams and we came up with these fun prototypes and we

187
00:07:20,388 --> 00:07:22,708
just, we tucked them away. We're like, okay, we're going to come back to this when we have

188
00:07:22,748 --> 00:07:27,089
time. Maybe on the side we'll do some work on these games. We'll ship them later. And

189
00:07:27,109 --> 00:07:33,210
then after Brutal Legend to, actually after Brutal Legend stopped, we did it again with

190
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:33,810
five teams.

191
00:07:37,033 --> 00:07:37,954
And we said, OK, these are great.

192
00:07:37,994 --> 00:07:40,216
We can do some of these, too, while we're working on

193
00:07:40,236 --> 00:07:40,636
Brutal Legend 2.

194
00:07:40,997 --> 00:07:41,998
We'll just do all this.

195
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,421
But the universe is a tricky, funny place.

196
00:07:45,922 --> 00:07:47,223
And the games industry is no exception.

197
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:48,624
And Brutal Legend 2 was canceled.

198
00:07:48,644 --> 00:07:51,927
And we were like, that's interesting, because we're

199
00:07:51,947 --> 00:07:52,528
going to go out of business.

200
00:07:54,617 --> 00:07:55,297
What can we do?

201
00:07:55,497 --> 00:07:59,258
What can we do to not, what's plan B of going out of business as plan A?

202
00:07:59,538 --> 00:08:01,739
Let's, we had nothing ready to go.

203
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,619
I had no big idea, because I was working on Brutal Legend 2.

204
00:08:03,659 --> 00:08:04,819
It was supposed to be a done deal.

205
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:05,820
I was concentrated on that.

206
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,540
I had nothing to pitch.

207
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,941
But then I thought about these nine prototypes we had made.

208
00:08:08,981 --> 00:08:10,981
And there were a lot of really promising, interesting things in there.

209
00:08:11,401 --> 00:08:14,502
And so we picked four of them, and we took them on the road.

210
00:08:14,602 --> 00:08:17,063
And we ended up, it took a little time, but we got them all signed.

211
00:08:17,123 --> 00:08:18,603
And we just shipped them all this year.

212
00:08:19,303 --> 00:08:22,084
And you can see them, Costume Quest stacking, Iron Brigade, and Sesame Street,

213
00:08:22,124 --> 00:08:22,644
Once Upon a Monster.

214
00:08:24,907 --> 00:08:26,509
And that was amazing to have these.

215
00:08:26,809 --> 00:08:28,831
It was really great to be able to take a demo on the road.

216
00:08:28,871 --> 00:08:30,793
And it's so much easier to sign a game when you have a demo.

217
00:08:31,414 --> 00:08:33,616
It made signing go faster.

218
00:08:33,976 --> 00:08:38,260
So today we're going to talk about the process of taking

219
00:08:38,301 --> 00:08:40,162
these prototypes and turning them into full games.

220
00:08:41,704 --> 00:08:44,246
And also the specific case studies of some of the

221
00:08:44,346 --> 00:08:45,788
production challenges that we face.

222
00:08:45,808 --> 00:08:47,570
Because this is a whole new way of doing production at

223
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:47,910
Double Fine.

224
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:48,671
It's a big change for us.

225
00:08:49,351 --> 00:08:51,672
And then, um, uh, the exact solutions

226
00:08:51,712 --> 00:08:53,573
that these teams, uh, came up with.

227
00:08:53,613 --> 00:08:54,613
And I'm gonna let these guys talk.

228
00:08:54,633 --> 00:08:56,314
Unfortunately, Tasha, who did Costume Quests,

229
00:08:56,334 --> 00:08:59,355
has, uh, went to Pixar,

230
00:08:59,655 --> 00:09:00,675
back to Pixar, where she came from.

231
00:09:00,956 --> 00:09:03,436
And, uh, she, uh, is not here,

232
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:06,057
but we have, um, these attractive young fellows

233
00:09:06,218 --> 00:09:06,698
to talk to you.

234
00:09:07,758 --> 00:09:09,979
Ahem.

235
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:11,880
That's actually the first design of the lamprey

236
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,500
from Rude Legend, I think, with Brad's head on it.

237
00:09:14,881 --> 00:09:14,941
Uh...

238
00:09:15,468 --> 00:09:22,310
We have Nathan Martz, the lead programmer of Legend and the lead of Once Upon a Monster.

239
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,151
And we have Brad Muir from Iron Brigade.

240
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:26,232
And they're going to tell these stories.

241
00:09:26,312 --> 00:09:30,213
And first up, we have young Mr. Lee Petty from the game Stacking.

242
00:09:30,853 --> 00:09:32,614
And I'm going to have him come up here and talk to you next.

243
00:09:32,674 --> 00:09:36,235
So here's a little peek at what Stacking looks like, just to remind you.

244
00:09:38,236 --> 00:09:39,177
Please welcome Mr. Lee Petty.

245
00:09:58,066 --> 00:09:59,867
Thank you, Tim.

246
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,642
for making sure that was very anti-climatic.

247
00:10:25,884 --> 00:10:26,424
I'm Lee Petty.

248
00:10:26,504 --> 00:10:28,285
I was the art director on Brutal Legend

249
00:10:28,445 --> 00:10:29,766
and the project lead on Stacking.

250
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,728
And I'm going to talk to you guys a bit about how Stacking

251
00:10:32,748 --> 00:10:34,609
started off in Amnesia Fortnight and kind of how

252
00:10:34,629 --> 00:10:36,130
we took it through production and some

253
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,151
of the challenges we faced.

254
00:10:37,972 --> 00:10:40,033
When I got the opportunity to come up

255
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:42,114
with an idea for a game for Amnesia Fortnight,

256
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:45,777
one of my first inspirations was a German expressionistic film.

257
00:10:46,317 --> 00:10:48,658
And these were films, silent films from the 1920s.

258
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,382
that were considered pretty experimental in their day.

259
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:56,005
And one of the things that I always found really inspirational and interesting about these films

260
00:10:56,146 --> 00:10:58,208
is that they had really small budgets.

261
00:10:58,588 --> 00:11:00,890
And one of the ways that they compensated for that,

262
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:03,633
one of the ways they made themselves interesting and stand out

263
00:11:03,733 --> 00:11:08,858
is that they designed these very unique, highly stylized stage and set designs.

264
00:11:11,001 --> 00:11:12,722
I was also really interested at the same time in a...

265
00:11:13,556 --> 00:11:15,918
coming up with a game that explored identity in some way,

266
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,860
maybe the changing player character identity.

267
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,882
And so I kind of, I did this little sketch at the time

268
00:11:19,902 --> 00:11:22,064
that was kind of fusing these two together about

269
00:11:22,405 --> 00:11:25,608
some crazy character that could wear living masks

270
00:11:25,668 --> 00:11:27,269
and when they put these living masks on,

271
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,772
they would, the rest of the way they would interact

272
00:11:29,792 --> 00:11:30,753
with the world would change.

273
00:11:31,714 --> 00:11:33,696
But that, these things are just a little too dark

274
00:11:33,756 --> 00:11:35,858
and weird for the sort of first.

275
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,550
game out of the gate for me, and I

276
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:39,271
really wanted to do something a little more charming.

277
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:40,751
And I wasn't sure where to go, and I

278
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,852
saw my daughter playing with a stack of Russian

279
00:11:43,552 --> 00:11:46,033
nesting dolls. And I thought, well, that'd be really

280
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:48,693
cool. Those are, they have their own style, and

281
00:11:48,713 --> 00:11:50,514
they're a little bit creepy, which is cool, but

282
00:11:50,554 --> 00:11:53,235
not too creepy. Like, German, anything German, really.

283
00:11:54,355 --> 00:11:56,516
And so I did this little sketch, and I

284
00:11:56,636 --> 00:11:57,876
was like, oh, we're gonna make this. And it

285
00:11:57,896 --> 00:12:00,197
was still let me explore themes of identity, because

286
00:12:01,822 --> 00:12:03,803
you know, what sort of worlds would these dolls live in,

287
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:04,723
and what's a relationship like?

288
00:12:04,763 --> 00:12:06,244
What does it mean to stack inside another doll?

289
00:12:06,544 --> 00:12:06,824
I don't know.

290
00:12:08,025 --> 00:12:11,647
And from there, I decided that we'd go forward

291
00:12:11,667 --> 00:12:14,128
with Russian dolls, and I wasn't sure,

292
00:12:14,368 --> 00:12:15,228
what do these dolls do?

293
00:12:15,248 --> 00:12:17,610
I mean, there's a lot of things they could do,

294
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,831
and I started thinking of ideas,

295
00:12:19,851 --> 00:12:21,031
and one of the first ideas was, well,

296
00:12:21,071 --> 00:12:23,132
maybe it's a game about gentlemen's hat combat.

297
00:12:24,593 --> 00:12:26,654
And, you know, they would fling hats at one another

298
00:12:26,674 --> 00:12:27,915
and resolve all their disputes that way.

299
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:31,008
But it, yeah, it's clearly been done too much.

300
00:12:31,268 --> 00:12:37,673
So I, instead I thought of something more, more mainstream,

301
00:12:37,713 --> 00:12:40,816
which was what if they fought German industrialist nutcrackers,

302
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:44,178
and these nutcrackers would arrive in the land of the Russian dolls

303
00:12:44,218 --> 00:12:47,261
and crush the poor little Russian dolls with their nutcracking jaws,

304
00:12:47,481 --> 00:12:49,162
and yeah.

305
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:50,663
Again, I was just starting to get into a dark place.

306
00:12:52,476 --> 00:12:54,418
I also remember at the time that we really

307
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:56,561
only had two weeks to make this game. So

308
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,603
rather than go down these, these roads, I decided

309
00:12:58,623 --> 00:13:02,128
to just focus just on the act of stacking.

310
00:13:02,868 --> 00:13:04,991
Let's make the mechanic, and the idea of stacking

311
00:13:05,011 --> 00:13:07,094
in another doll or within a doll, the whole

312
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:09,296
focus of the Amnesia Fortnite prototype.

313
00:13:10,658 --> 00:13:11,639
At the same time, I thought,

314
00:13:12,354 --> 00:13:14,076
Well, it'd be really cool to do an adventure game.

315
00:13:14,136 --> 00:13:18,921
I grew up with adventure games, and I work at the same company as Mr. Tim Schafer and Ron Gilbert,

316
00:13:18,941 --> 00:13:21,784
two of the pioneers of the adventure game genre.

317
00:13:21,804 --> 00:13:24,487
I thought I could benefit from some of their knowledge,

318
00:13:24,527 --> 00:13:27,350
and it'd be good to get to it before senility drives it from their heads.

319
00:13:28,371 --> 00:13:32,636
And it was really not a good assumption, but I thought it was going to work.

320
00:13:34,924 --> 00:13:38,566
So, we did the Amnesia Fortnite demo and it worked well.

321
00:13:39,086 --> 00:13:39,666
Tim liked it.

322
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:40,706
We pitched it.

323
00:13:40,767 --> 00:13:42,387
We were fortunate enough to sign the game.

324
00:13:43,047 --> 00:13:46,909
And then we were like, oh, well, we have to actually make this now.

325
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:47,989
That's tricky.

326
00:13:48,349 --> 00:13:53,471
And one of the big challenges for us in stacking was that we wanted to do an original high

327
00:13:53,511 --> 00:13:57,373
fidelity game, but we had a really small budget and we had a short time frame, like nine months.

328
00:13:57,953 --> 00:14:04,139
and a small team. And we wanted to do something in this downloadable space that let us do

329
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,823
things that we otherwise couldn't do in big games. So maybe things are a little different

330
00:14:07,843 --> 00:14:12,228
visually and gameplay-wise. And a lot of that comes from the personality of the game, and

331
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:16,692
personality is important to us. But personality is often expressed in the small details and

332
00:14:16,712 --> 00:14:20,436
the presentation of the game, and that doesn't, that takes a lot of time. So how are we going

333
00:14:20,456 --> 00:14:20,857
to do that?

334
00:14:22,777 --> 00:14:24,838
And we knew the expectations would be high, both internally,

335
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:27,700
because we had just come off of Brutal Legend and spent a lot

336
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,542
of time with so many characters and really manicuring this

337
00:14:31,642 --> 00:14:32,602
large world.

338
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:34,603
We didn't want to give up that attention to detail.

339
00:14:34,963 --> 00:14:38,765
And the XBLA and PSN markets, the games were getting more

340
00:14:38,805 --> 00:14:40,466
elaborate on those when we pitched these.

341
00:14:40,526 --> 00:14:43,648
So we needed a way of thinking about making this game, like

342
00:14:43,688 --> 00:14:45,609
how we're going to make this game, some sort of guideline

343
00:14:46,149 --> 00:14:47,009
to keep us on track.

344
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,971
And the term we used was economy of design.

345
00:14:50,091 --> 00:14:50,711
And by that,

346
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,491
I simply mean that we wanted the game to

347
00:14:54,551 --> 00:14:57,853
have everything it needed to feel itself, but nothing

348
00:14:57,953 --> 00:14:58,953
else. No fat.

349
00:14:59,394 --> 00:15:00,954
And we were gonna start this production by, by,

350
00:15:01,154 --> 00:15:03,656
by starting small and growing instead of big and

351
00:15:03,696 --> 00:15:07,317
cut. And that sounds obvious, but actually just about every

352
00:15:07,357 --> 00:15:09,338
game I've worked on has done the exact opposite.

353
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:13,780
It starts with really over-ambitious systems design, huge lists

354
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,241
of assets, and they inevitably are cut as the,

355
00:15:16,341 --> 00:15:17,742
as the production goes on, but we didn't have

356
00:15:17,762 --> 00:15:18,482
that time to waste.

357
00:15:20,096 --> 00:15:23,258
And one of the ways we thought about it was, let's just relate everything we come up with,

358
00:15:23,338 --> 00:15:29,662
visually, gameplay-wise, narrative, to the core idea of just stacking. And if it doesn't

359
00:15:29,702 --> 00:15:34,425
directly relate to that, that almost physicality of stacking within the doll, then let's just

360
00:15:34,465 --> 00:15:34,965
not pursue it.

361
00:15:36,806 --> 00:15:41,009
And that doesn't mean, though, that we came up with a really tiny feature set up front

362
00:15:41,129 --> 00:15:43,931
and just never did anything and executed on it and we were all happy.

363
00:15:44,584 --> 00:15:47,586
wore money hats. It, it meant that we created

364
00:15:47,706 --> 00:15:50,268
headroom for ourselves that during the production, because we

365
00:15:50,288 --> 00:15:52,270
didn't have much of a pre-production, during the production

366
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:54,191
we could look for creative opportunities to expand the

367
00:15:54,211 --> 00:15:55,072
game and enhance it.

368
00:15:56,793 --> 00:15:58,835
And one way that this idea of economy design

369
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,116
really made sense, the obvious way, is that the

370
00:16:01,156 --> 00:16:03,598
characters. We basically had one character model for the

371
00:16:03,638 --> 00:16:04,158
entire game.

372
00:16:04,872 --> 00:16:10,714
and rather than, you know, make the characters interesting through lots of variation in the

373
00:16:10,774 --> 00:16:16,435
shape, we just challenged ourselves to do them with the textures itself. We did find,

374
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:21,256
though, that, that characters, or the players, rather, needed to have some, another layer

375
00:16:21,276 --> 00:16:25,397
of differentiation on top of the characters, because the characters were used to solve

376
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,298
all the puzzles in the game. They were the inventory.

377
00:16:27,798 --> 00:16:32,822
as well as the characters. So we did that by just adding simple accessories and a lot

378
00:16:32,842 --> 00:16:36,405
of hats and canes and monocles and, you know, those sorts of things. But they were very

379
00:16:36,445 --> 00:16:40,489
quick to make. They added a lot of new personality to the game as well and they accomplished

380
00:16:40,509 --> 00:16:42,591
that gameplay goal of recognizability.

381
00:16:43,523 --> 00:16:45,344
And the characters were really cheap to render, right?

382
00:16:45,364 --> 00:16:46,505
They weren't very many polygons.

383
00:16:46,885 --> 00:16:48,026
They had very few bones.

384
00:16:48,246 --> 00:16:49,747
And that meant that we could put a lot of them

385
00:16:49,767 --> 00:16:50,307
on screen at once.

386
00:16:50,347 --> 00:16:53,549
So a lot of our levels had about 100 to 200 dolls

387
00:16:53,629 --> 00:16:55,370
on screen at once moving around, doing their thing.

388
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:58,112
And that let us create an actual world, which was really

389
00:16:58,152 --> 00:17:00,633
important to us, like we did in Brutal Legend, but in a

390
00:17:00,693 --> 00:17:01,834
much more economical way.

391
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:06,673
The other issue that we ran into is that we, again,

392
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:07,533
we love personality.

393
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,335
We try and put personality into our games.

394
00:17:09,415 --> 00:17:12,457
But how do we do that animation-wise with just a few

395
00:17:12,497 --> 00:17:12,778
joints?

396
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:16,241
And we considered adding animating textures or some

397
00:17:16,261 --> 00:17:17,582
sort of detailed facial animation.

398
00:17:17,642 --> 00:17:20,124
But I thought it would just be really a little too creepy to

399
00:17:20,184 --> 00:17:21,965
have an animating face on a doll.

400
00:17:22,466 --> 00:17:24,007
And it was an expensive choice.

401
00:17:24,047 --> 00:17:26,609
So we just tried to animate just using rigid body

402
00:17:26,649 --> 00:17:27,129
animation.

403
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:28,731
And it was really charming.

404
00:17:28,771 --> 00:17:29,651
It actually worked pretty well.

405
00:17:30,266 --> 00:17:32,469
And my takeaway is to torture your animators.

406
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:36,834
Because just give them really strange requests and see what

407
00:17:36,874 --> 00:17:38,176
they come up with.

408
00:17:38,196 --> 00:17:39,617
But they're really clever, right?

409
00:17:40,985 --> 00:17:45,366
They can communicate ideas and emotions in ways that are really long form to communicate

410
00:17:45,386 --> 00:17:47,787
other ways, but they do it really well with simple motion.

411
00:17:47,827 --> 00:17:51,848
And as an example, I had this little dog character in a level and he did a lot of tricks and

412
00:17:51,868 --> 00:17:54,048
did things like walk on his hind legs and back flip.

413
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:58,529
And so I said to the animators, like, I would really like this dog to drag his ass across

414
00:17:58,569 --> 00:18:01,450
the ground on occasion because, you know, if you've ever had a dog, they occasionally

415
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:02,990
do that and it's really funny.

416
00:18:03,641 --> 00:18:05,062
And, um, do you think you could do that?

417
00:18:05,082 --> 00:18:06,844
And they're like, the dog doesn't even have an ass to drag.

418
00:18:06,884 --> 00:18:07,865
And I was like, just give it a shot.

419
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:09,346
Uh, it'll be great.

420
00:18:09,606 --> 00:18:10,747
And, uh, and they did.

421
00:18:10,787 --> 00:18:12,469
And it looked, it looked a little something like this.

422
00:18:12,669 --> 00:18:14,771
This little, let me drag him here.

423
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:20,036
So, yeah, animators are good.

424
00:18:21,526 --> 00:18:23,447
But the art production really wasn't the only way

425
00:18:23,487 --> 00:18:24,647
that we used economy design.

426
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:27,468
The gameplay itself centered on a series of adventure game

427
00:18:27,488 --> 00:18:29,148
style puzzles that we called challenges.

428
00:18:29,948 --> 00:18:30,989
And one of the things that made the challenges

429
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:32,909
a little different in stacking than other adventure games

430
00:18:32,949 --> 00:18:34,350
is that they all had multiple solutions.

431
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,130
The player only had to do one solution,

432
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:40,191
but they could choose to do many different solutions

433
00:18:40,211 --> 00:18:41,612
for a particular challenge and get rewarded.

434
00:18:42,212 --> 00:18:43,692
And although that sounds like a ton of work,

435
00:18:44,112 --> 00:18:47,213
and it is, it's a lot less than creating unique puzzles,

436
00:18:47,273 --> 00:18:47,853
right, because.

437
00:18:48,199 --> 00:18:51,540
We were able to use the same art assets, the area of the world, a lot of the writing and

438
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,720
set up some of the same dolls.

439
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:58,922
So we got a pretty economical approach to replayability that way, as opposed to making

440
00:18:58,982 --> 00:19:00,542
so many unique challenges.

441
00:19:01,802 --> 00:19:06,944
And the other thing that was a nice byproduct of that is that it increased the accessibility

442
00:19:06,964 --> 00:19:11,265
of the game, which was a goal for us on stacking, was to make it very casual and approachable.

443
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:12,185
And I think...

444
00:19:14,588 --> 00:19:18,675
In most adventure games, there's one solution, and if players try something differently,

445
00:19:19,156 --> 00:19:22,801
and it's logical, it just doesn't work, that's sort of a classic snafu.

446
00:19:22,882 --> 00:19:25,967
And in our case, since we had multiple solutions, odds were they were going to find one of them.

447
00:19:26,755 --> 00:19:28,976
And that, that worked out well. The last thing

448
00:19:29,016 --> 00:19:30,937
about challenges that's worth noting is that the solutions,

449
00:19:31,277 --> 00:19:33,037
because they could be done in any order or

450
00:19:33,117 --> 00:19:34,538
not at all by the player, they had to

451
00:19:34,578 --> 00:19:36,419
be designed so they had no dependency on each

452
00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:38,760
other. And the game flow itself had no dependency

453
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,181
on any single solution. So all the way up

454
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,021
to, well, I should say alpha, but it was

455
00:19:43,061 --> 00:19:45,402
probably like a week before submission, we were messing

456
00:19:45,422 --> 00:19:48,143
with the game play and swapping solutions in and

457
00:19:48,183 --> 00:19:49,624
out based on what we saw people trying to

458
00:19:49,664 --> 00:19:51,005
do in, in play tests. And if they were

459
00:19:51,025 --> 00:19:52,505
trying to do something that seemed logical, we

460
00:19:52,945 --> 00:19:54,827
We just made a new doll, coded a solution in,

461
00:19:54,867 --> 00:19:57,709
and then two days later or so, we had a whole new solution.

462
00:19:57,909 --> 00:19:58,310
It worked well.

463
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:02,393
So we also ran into problems in that we

464
00:20:02,874 --> 00:20:04,115
had no budget for voice acting.

465
00:20:04,474 --> 00:20:06,535
But we had a lot of characters.

466
00:20:06,555 --> 00:20:08,495
I mean, we had a couple hundred unique characters.

467
00:20:08,535 --> 00:20:10,635
I think when I counted, there was about 28,000 lines of

468
00:20:10,675 --> 00:20:12,756
dialogue, a lot of stuff there.

469
00:20:13,096 --> 00:20:14,916
And so I knew we were going to have to put text on screen.

470
00:20:15,336 --> 00:20:18,537
But I was really uncomfortable with that because text on

471
00:20:18,577 --> 00:20:21,618
screen just didn't feel, I wanted it to be cohesive,

472
00:20:21,658 --> 00:20:23,458
thematically cohesive with the rest of the game.

473
00:20:24,118 --> 00:20:27,079
And then I remembered one of my early inspirations, German

474
00:20:27,099 --> 00:20:28,019
expressionistic film.

475
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:28,519
So.

476
00:20:30,381 --> 00:20:31,804
I brought back the idea of silent films.

477
00:20:31,844 --> 00:20:34,149
And we did all of our storytelling with a silent

478
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:36,555
film motif, and even complete with dialogue

479
00:20:36,575 --> 00:20:37,618
cards and everything.

480
00:20:38,974 --> 00:20:40,235
And that worked out pretty well, but then we ran

481
00:20:40,255 --> 00:20:41,455
into the fact that we had a pretty small

482
00:20:41,495 --> 00:20:43,716
music budget and silent films are scored and we

483
00:20:43,736 --> 00:20:46,158
couldn't afford to score all these with custom music.

484
00:20:46,358 --> 00:20:51,540
And our, our awesome audio guys licensed classical music and

485
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,562
managed to edit that to the cut scenes as

486
00:20:54,622 --> 00:20:56,222
if it were custom scored music, and it worked

487
00:20:56,302 --> 00:20:56,803
really well.

488
00:20:57,223 --> 00:20:58,724
And it was really awesome to have a

489
00:20:58,764 --> 00:21:00,524
doll fart while Chopin was playing in the background,

490
00:21:00,604 --> 00:21:01,045
which was great.

491
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,241
And, and ultimately this silent film stuff added more

492
00:21:04,281 --> 00:21:06,062
personality for us. It gave us another motif to

493
00:21:06,082 --> 00:21:07,363
kind of weave in with some of the

494
00:21:07,383 --> 00:21:10,044
other influences. We added silent film stacking dolls. We

495
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:12,326
did our crossfades in silent film style. We, we

496
00:21:12,346 --> 00:21:13,546
played a lot with those themes, the kind of

497
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,828
overacting and all that sort of stuff. And, and

498
00:21:15,868 --> 00:21:18,369
it really just gave us another great angle on

499
00:21:18,389 --> 00:21:18,650
the game.

500
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:21,811
So my lessons learned from this process are, are

501
00:21:22,012 --> 00:21:24,453
very straightforward, but important. One is to embrace your

502
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:26,214
limitations. You hear this a lot, and I think

503
00:21:26,254 --> 00:21:27,195
a lot of times it's more of a,

504
00:21:27,235 --> 00:21:27,635
like, ugh.

505
00:21:28,326 --> 00:21:30,228
we can't possibly do. So just embrace it, stomach it.

506
00:21:30,268 --> 00:21:31,650
And that's not really what I'm thinking. Like, the

507
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:34,333
idea of, we embraced our limitations and by embracing

508
00:21:34,353 --> 00:21:36,856
them we made different creative choices than we would

509
00:21:36,877 --> 00:21:38,979
have otherwise made. And that went a long ways

510
00:21:39,019 --> 00:21:42,143
to giving the game its own sense of personality.

511
00:21:42,183 --> 00:21:44,586
So just work with those limitations. It's probably gonna

512
00:21:44,626 --> 00:21:46,288
come out pretty cool. Like, most, everyone in this

513
00:21:46,308 --> 00:21:47,069
industry is really clever.

514
00:21:48,589 --> 00:21:49,989
And then find your essence early.

515
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,551
I think the amnesia Fortnite process forces you to,

516
00:21:53,731 --> 00:21:55,632
forces you in a very fatherly good way,

517
00:21:55,932 --> 00:21:59,134
to find all of the personality up front.

518
00:21:59,554 --> 00:22:00,955
Don't just prototype the core mechanic

519
00:22:00,995 --> 00:22:01,735
in the gray box world.

520
00:22:01,755 --> 00:22:04,056
That's valuable, yes, but it's much more valuable

521
00:22:04,097 --> 00:22:06,018
to do that and try and get the art look in there

522
00:22:06,318 --> 00:22:07,218
and get the music in there.

523
00:22:07,438 --> 00:22:09,059
So you can see all those connections early on.

524
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:10,700
And then the team who's making it with you

525
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,521
has a hand in forging the vision for the game.

526
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:14,602
So when you go right into production,

527
00:22:14,622 --> 00:22:15,502
everyone's on board with the vision

528
00:22:15,522 --> 00:22:16,303
because they helped make it.

529
00:22:16,884 --> 00:22:18,905
as opposed to reading some large document and looking

530
00:22:18,926 --> 00:22:20,187
at a bunch of gray box prototypes.

531
00:22:22,629 --> 00:22:24,931
So I talked a little bit about finding

532
00:22:24,951 --> 00:22:26,813
the essence in your product early and why that's

533
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:27,193
important.

534
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:30,556
But next up, Mr. Nathan Martz, project lead

535
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:32,238
of Once Upon a Monster, is gonna talk about

536
00:22:33,098 --> 00:22:36,161
keeping that vision intact even though the product itself

537
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:38,723
might have to adapt to a variety of situations.

538
00:22:40,445 --> 00:22:40,725
Nathan.

539
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:45,713
where you'll learn the character,

540
00:22:45,753 --> 00:22:49,136
mission, and fun with Sesame Street Once Upon a Monster.

541
00:22:49,317 --> 00:22:52,220
Join Sesame Street's Cookie Monster and Elmo

542
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,622
in a controller-free storybook adventure

543
00:22:54,722 --> 00:22:56,765
filled with important life lessons,

544
00:22:56,965 --> 00:23:00,208
inspiring challenges, and friendly new monsters

545
00:23:00,409 --> 00:23:02,971
that even the biggest of kids will enjoy.

546
00:23:03,252 --> 00:23:04,813
Sesame Street Once Upon a Monster.

547
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:11,395
Hey everyone, I'm Nathan Martz and I'm the project lead of Sesame Street Once Upon a

548
00:23:11,435 --> 00:23:12,817
Monster, the game you can see up there.

549
00:23:13,397 --> 00:23:17,862
And if you really want to understand where Once Upon a Monster started, we need to go

550
00:23:18,002 --> 00:23:18,862
back in time.

551
00:23:18,903 --> 00:23:24,107
We need to rewind all the way back to a time when housing prices could only go up and when

552
00:23:24,207 --> 00:23:27,010
cutting edge internet humor was Rick Rolling and LOLcats.

553
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,392
And by that I mean the amazing year of 2007.

554
00:23:31,474 --> 00:23:35,638
So, back then, five years ago, while the rest of the world was making irresponsible real

555
00:23:35,658 --> 00:23:39,362
estate investments, I was writing the dismemberment code for Brutal Legend.

556
00:23:40,263 --> 00:23:44,147
And it turns out, this is actually not the first time I'd written dismemberment code

557
00:23:44,547 --> 00:23:45,388
for a video game.

558
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,429
It was actually the second time.

559
00:23:46,809 --> 00:23:52,134
And as I was writing code, along with Drew, to dismember limbs and heads and spout blood,

560
00:23:52,755 --> 00:23:55,276
I kind of started to feel like I was done with that,

561
00:23:55,396 --> 00:23:58,336
and I was really excited to think about the next game that I worked on,

562
00:23:58,376 --> 00:24:01,297
as much as I loved Brutal Legend and I loved the team that I was building it with,

563
00:24:01,757 --> 00:24:03,838
that I wanted to do something different for my next game,

564
00:24:03,858 --> 00:24:06,819
that I wanted to explore a different set of emotions.

565
00:24:07,539 --> 00:24:09,900
But I wasn't exactly sure what that was.

566
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,520
But fortunately...

567
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:16,485
five years ago, I came to GDC and I saw an amazing talk by Tsutomu Kuono, who you probably

568
00:24:16,525 --> 00:24:21,048
better know as the creator of LocoRoco. And it was really inspiring for me to see this

569
00:24:21,109 --> 00:24:26,753
talk by a guy who is so clearly committed to making a, like, fun, positive, uplifting

570
00:24:26,793 --> 00:24:30,636
game. It's one of my all-time favorite games. And I was like, wow, I want to make

571
00:24:31,217 --> 00:24:36,419
a game like that. Except I don't want to copy him, I want to do something that's my own,

572
00:24:36,439 --> 00:24:40,521
that's original, because that's what we're about at Double Fine. So like a lot of us

573
00:24:40,561 --> 00:24:44,603
do, I started sort of with my childhood heroes. I thought back to the people that influenced

574
00:24:44,723 --> 00:24:50,025
me creatively. Bill Watterson, for example, the creator of Calvin and Hobbes, and also

575
00:24:50,065 --> 00:24:54,587
Jim Henson, the creator of The Muppets. And what struck me about both of these childhood

576
00:24:54,627 --> 00:24:59,510
heroes was how remarkably positive they were in their work, that people remember them.

577
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:03,391
for the amazingly good-natured work that they did.

578
00:25:03,411 --> 00:25:04,752
And I was like, that's awesome.

579
00:25:04,792 --> 00:25:07,773
I would love to do a game with that same level

580
00:25:07,974 --> 00:25:09,734
of upbeat positivity.

581
00:25:10,682 --> 00:25:13,964
You know, I was also learning how to be a really terrible musician at the time,

582
00:25:14,264 --> 00:25:15,245
like remarkably bad.

583
00:25:16,126 --> 00:25:20,989
But along the way I was learning, I was reminded of how evocative music can be

584
00:25:21,049 --> 00:25:24,072
as a tool for creating emotion and expressing emotion.

585
00:25:24,472 --> 00:25:27,554
It's like there are very few things that tap into like our inner selves the way

586
00:25:27,594 --> 00:25:28,375
that music does.

587
00:25:29,056 --> 00:25:32,458
In fact, one day my girlfriend at the time, and that's actually not a photo of her,

588
00:25:33,939 --> 00:25:35,460
She came up to me and she said,

589
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,801
you know, do you ever have like a happy song,

590
00:25:37,861 --> 00:25:39,762
a song that like gets stuck in your head

591
00:25:39,782 --> 00:25:41,903
and you just feel better for listening to it?

592
00:25:42,664 --> 00:25:43,584
You know, and of course I was like,

593
00:25:43,664 --> 00:25:46,406
nah baby, I'm all mad, I don't have happy songs.

594
00:25:46,966 --> 00:25:49,568
But, you know, of course, we all do.

595
00:25:49,588 --> 00:25:54,370
We all have songs that we,

596
00:25:55,191 --> 00:25:56,871
as a game developer, that's as macho as I get.

597
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:02,112
You know, we all have songs that really move us.

598
00:26:02,412 --> 00:26:04,614
So when Tim came up to me later that year and he said,

599
00:26:04,634 --> 00:26:06,795
hey, I want to do this crazy thing called Amnesia Fortnite.

600
00:26:07,095 --> 00:26:08,176
Do you have any ideas?

601
00:26:08,696 --> 00:26:10,737
I was like, actually I do.

602
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:13,058
I've got this idea for a game where you experience

603
00:26:13,098 --> 00:26:14,859
the joy of creating music.

604
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:16,620
In fact, there's this game that I want to make,

605
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,761
and it's going to be an interactive musical toy.

606
00:26:19,342 --> 00:26:20,542
And in this toy, you're going to create

607
00:26:20,562 --> 00:26:22,663
your own personal happy song.

608
00:26:23,144 --> 00:26:24,564
But the thing is, most people.

609
00:26:25,205 --> 00:26:26,926
they're not musicians, they need some help.

610
00:26:27,287 --> 00:26:29,028
So we're gonna introduce them to some friends

611
00:26:29,228 --> 00:26:30,990
who are musical monsters.

612
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:32,951
And those musical monsters are gonna help them

613
00:26:33,332 --> 00:26:35,253
make their own personal happy song.

614
00:26:36,034 --> 00:26:38,876
Tim was into the idea and we started Amnesia Fortnight.

615
00:26:38,936 --> 00:26:40,398
Two weeks later, we made a prototype.

616
00:26:40,838 --> 00:26:43,140
I'm sorry, I forgot to mention that because we only had two weeks,

617
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,222
it was going to be minimalistic environments, very simple.

618
00:26:46,322 --> 00:26:47,823
Music, monsters, the end.

619
00:26:48,784 --> 00:26:51,126
So we made that prototype, and it looked like this.

620
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:55,289
An awesome little jamboree of musical monsters in a minimalist environment,

621
00:26:55,589 --> 00:26:57,590
and we called the game Happy Song.

622
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:00,492
And we were super proud of it, but being Amnesia Fortnight,

623
00:27:00,532 --> 00:27:03,895
we forgot about it until two years later in 2009,

624
00:27:04,015 --> 00:27:05,716
when the end of Brutal Legend was in sight.

625
00:27:06,497 --> 00:27:08,938
And at that time, Tim came up to me, and he said,

626
00:27:08,978 --> 00:27:12,560
you know, hey, let's make a small game, you know,

627
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,542
maybe something in addition to this big game

628
00:27:14,562 --> 00:27:16,463
that we know we're going to do called Brutal Legend.

629
00:27:17,343 --> 00:27:19,985
You know, let's pitch Happy Song as that game.

630
00:27:20,365 --> 00:27:21,786
And I was like, that's awesome.

631
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,407
You know, I would love to pitch the game.

632
00:27:24,227 --> 00:27:25,668
But if we're going to pitch it, we actually

633
00:27:25,688 --> 00:27:28,330
have to pitch it, you know, to the suits, right,

634
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:30,871
to publishers, that we're going to have to make this game,

635
00:27:30,891 --> 00:27:35,034
we're going to have to make it seem at least commercial.

636
00:27:38,057 --> 00:27:44,123
Yeah. And, and the thing is, like, publishers are, they have reasonable reasons for wanting

637
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:48,386
commercial games, and the thing is that when we looked at the Happy Song prototype, we

638
00:27:48,426 --> 00:27:53,811
honestly felt like it wasn't commercial. That it wasn't actually going to be a viable commercial

639
00:27:53,891 --> 00:27:58,695
product. In particular, we felt like the Monster Friends were really, really awesome, but the

640
00:27:58,736 --> 00:28:04,701
musical toy was less so. It felt really honestly kind of niche, you know, even for us. So.

641
00:28:06,202 --> 00:28:11,648
So that was really the essence of our production challenge, was how could we adapt the prototype,

642
00:28:12,029 --> 00:28:17,314
sign the game, and preserve the vision, preserve this idea of a game about joy, of a game that

643
00:28:17,334 --> 00:28:19,136
makes you feel happier for having played it.

644
00:28:19,947 --> 00:28:22,811
So we actually did two adaptations of that game.

645
00:28:22,831 --> 00:28:24,893
And the first adaptation was to pitch it.

646
00:28:25,334 --> 00:28:27,256
And the second adaptation was to sign it.

647
00:28:27,716 --> 00:28:29,558
And our first opportunity to adapt the game

648
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:31,801
was with Kinect, which as you all know,

649
00:28:31,821 --> 00:28:33,483
was announced with much fanfare at E3 in 2009.

650
00:28:35,845 --> 00:28:39,488
And when that came out, we're like, wow, this is a new platform, which is going to mean

651
00:28:39,568 --> 00:28:41,950
new opportunity, a hunger for new IPs.

652
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,771
And it's obviously family-oriented.

653
00:28:43,791 --> 00:28:48,254
Microsoft is making a play for the Wii audience, and they're going to want wholesome, uplifting,

654
00:28:48,375 --> 00:28:51,857
positive, you know, pro-social entertainment for that device.

655
00:28:52,257 --> 00:28:55,280
There's going to be a demand maybe for new mechanics, because like there's no buttons

656
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,521
and it tracks your skeleton.

657
00:28:56,861 --> 00:28:58,162
So maybe we could innovate there.

658
00:28:59,002 --> 00:29:00,743
And in the end, it was a great opportunity.

659
00:29:00,763 --> 00:29:03,906
But the question was, how could we adapt this game about

660
00:29:03,966 --> 00:29:06,808
musical monsters to really work on Kinect?

661
00:29:07,771 --> 00:29:13,852
So the idea that we had to adapt it was to change from a game about just musical monsters

662
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:18,433
and the joy of making music into a game about the joy of interacting, interacting with other

663
00:29:18,473 --> 00:29:19,893
people and with monsters.

664
00:29:20,233 --> 00:29:23,914
And the game that we were going to make would be a collection of monster mini-games all

665
00:29:23,954 --> 00:29:25,714
about interactions with monsters.

666
00:29:26,115 --> 00:29:30,055
Of course, we wanted to keep what works, in particular the monster friends and a game

667
00:29:30,095 --> 00:29:31,336
that makes you feel happy.

668
00:29:31,356 --> 00:29:33,116
Those are still going to be the essence of the product.

669
00:29:33,556 --> 00:29:35,018
But we had to change some stuff as well.

670
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:36,380
And the first thing that we wanted to change

671
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,503
was the focus on character interaction.

672
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:40,685
Where the original prototype was focused on music,

673
00:29:41,046 --> 00:29:43,469
we were going to focus on the connection between the characters

674
00:29:43,509 --> 00:29:44,030
in the world.

675
00:29:44,731 --> 00:29:47,334
And in order to do that, we're going to have multiple activities.

676
00:29:47,374 --> 00:29:48,115
We wanted to have.

677
00:29:48,963 --> 00:29:52,465
a game that where you could play dress up with the monsters,

678
00:29:52,485 --> 00:29:54,686
you could do a posing Simon Says game, you could dance.

679
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:57,308
All of these things would be ways to interact with them.

680
00:29:57,728 --> 00:29:59,389
And these activities would be more physical

681
00:29:59,429 --> 00:30:00,970
because on Kinect, physical is fun.

682
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:04,332
So we had to de-emphasize music and emphasize the physicality.

683
00:30:04,813 --> 00:30:06,233
And lastly, we want to take advantage

684
00:30:06,273 --> 00:30:09,836
of the magic of Kinect, that Kinect can see you and pretend

685
00:30:09,876 --> 00:30:11,677
that the monsters could also see you

686
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:13,278
so that you could interact with them

687
00:30:13,298 --> 00:30:14,799
in a very direct, connected way.

688
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:17,114
As part of that, we're like, well, if you're interacting

689
00:30:17,134 --> 00:30:18,574
with the monsters, how about also

690
00:30:18,694 --> 00:30:20,155
interacting with other people?

691
00:30:20,795 --> 00:30:24,197
We really love this idea of parent-child co-play, a game

692
00:30:24,217 --> 00:30:25,818
that parents and kids could play together.

693
00:30:25,838 --> 00:30:28,459
So we're going to make all of the activities two-player.

694
00:30:28,479 --> 00:30:30,520
We're going to have a fundamentally

695
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,860
intergenerational focus.

696
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,521
And you can play it with a friend, you can play it with a

697
00:30:33,561 --> 00:30:36,322
sibling, but really we want to focus on a

698
00:30:36,382 --> 00:30:37,783
parent and a young child.

699
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:40,804
And lastly, that means it's going to be a real world

700
00:30:40,824 --> 00:30:44,046
interaction, but not just a synthetic interaction with the

701
00:30:44,086 --> 00:30:45,146
characters on screen.

702
00:30:46,753 --> 00:30:49,835
As part of that, we realized that our minimalistic environment

703
00:30:49,915 --> 00:30:50,855
wasn't going to work.

704
00:30:50,916 --> 00:30:52,856
In order to contextualize these activities,

705
00:30:53,277 --> 00:30:57,419
we needed an actual world, a place that these activities could happen.

706
00:30:57,439 --> 00:31:00,580
And we were really inspired by storybook illustrators

707
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,381
like Eric Carle and Mary Blair.

708
00:31:02,641 --> 00:31:05,062
We love their flat, two-dimensional sensibilities.

709
00:31:05,583 --> 00:31:07,344
And so we said, well, we're going to have an environment,

710
00:31:07,384 --> 00:31:09,665
but we're going to embrace still this idea of minimalism,

711
00:31:10,145 --> 00:31:12,686
of a 2D, flat, simply constructed world.

712
00:31:13,617 --> 00:31:16,119
And the last thing we're going to do is players are going to need instruction.

713
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:19,761
They're going to need to know what to do and how to do it, so we're going to add a narrator.

714
00:31:19,821 --> 00:31:22,283
Maybe, you know, a David Attenborough-esque character.

715
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:26,085
He's going to provide exposition and instruction, but, you know,

716
00:31:26,406 --> 00:31:28,947
because some narrators are kind of strange-looking, he'll be disembodied

717
00:31:29,488 --> 00:31:33,130
and omniscient and, you know, not actually part of the real experience.

718
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,671
So that was actually all awesome,

719
00:31:35,931 --> 00:31:37,371
and we adapted our game.

720
00:31:37,531 --> 00:31:38,691
We made a new prototype.

721
00:31:38,751 --> 00:31:39,592
It looked like this.

722
00:31:39,992 --> 00:31:41,652
And we called it Monster Party, because it

723
00:31:41,672 --> 00:31:43,753
was going to represent this idea of a collaborative

724
00:31:43,853 --> 00:31:45,013
social experience.

725
00:31:45,853 --> 00:31:47,333
And that was all super awesome.

726
00:31:47,433 --> 00:31:49,134
But then another opportunity came along,

727
00:31:49,154 --> 00:31:50,454
and that opportunity was in early 2010,

728
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:53,575
when I read a Gamasutra article where

729
00:31:53,595 --> 00:31:54,955
we heard Warner Brothers had announced

730
00:31:54,975 --> 00:31:56,115
a brand new partnership.

731
00:31:56,155 --> 00:31:58,276
And the partnership was with Sesame Street,

732
00:31:58,336 --> 00:31:59,696
that Warner Brothers was going to become

733
00:32:00,096 --> 00:32:02,897
the exclusive publisher and distributor of all things

734
00:32:02,937 --> 00:32:03,637
Sesame Street.

735
00:32:03,657 --> 00:32:04,012
Thank you.

736
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,061
So one of the cool things about that was that these were

737
00:32:07,121 --> 00:32:08,962
obviously very compatible values.

738
00:32:09,182 --> 00:32:11,683
Sesame Street is about education and making the world

739
00:32:11,703 --> 00:32:12,364
a better place.

740
00:32:12,424 --> 00:32:14,305
We were about making games a better place.

741
00:32:14,705 --> 00:32:16,686
And in fact, this would be a return to our original

742
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:20,008
inspiration, not just inspired by Jim Henson, but working

743
00:32:20,048 --> 00:32:22,029
directly with some of his creations.

744
00:32:22,569 --> 00:32:24,490
So as with the Kinect, it was a great

745
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:25,831
opportunity for our game.

746
00:32:25,851 --> 00:32:29,513
But now the question was, how could we adapt that game for

747
00:32:29,593 --> 00:32:30,193
Sesame Street?

748
00:32:30,213 --> 00:32:31,734
How could we make this game into something that really

749
00:32:31,834 --> 00:32:33,355
felt genuinely Sesame?

750
00:32:34,372 --> 00:32:39,278
So, the idea we had was to adapt again the game and to change it from being about the

751
00:32:39,318 --> 00:32:44,243
joy of interaction to the joy of helping others, of which interaction is kind of a subset.

752
00:32:44,664 --> 00:32:49,009
And the game is going to turn from a collection of activities into a collection of stories.

753
00:32:49,049 --> 00:32:51,973
Stories about monsters with problems who need your help.

754
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:54,754
in order to make sure that their story has a happy ending.

755
00:32:55,255 --> 00:32:56,856
And as before, we're going to keep what works.

756
00:32:56,896 --> 00:32:58,277
We're going to keep the monster friends,

757
00:32:58,297 --> 00:33:00,518
the interactive gameplay, the parent-child co-play,

758
00:33:00,918 --> 00:33:02,339
and a game that makes you feel happy.

759
00:33:02,379 --> 00:33:04,140
All these things are important, and they're successful,

760
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:04,961
and they're going to stay.

761
00:33:05,321 --> 00:33:07,162
But some other things, again, have to change.

762
00:33:07,703 --> 00:33:10,544
So the first big change was that the storybook-inspired world

763
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:12,365
became a literal storybook.

764
00:33:12,386 --> 00:33:14,127
We actually decided to fictionalize the world

765
00:33:14,187 --> 00:33:15,507
as a storybook come to life.

766
00:33:16,326 --> 00:33:19,189
Again, that provided a context for not just the activities,

767
00:33:19,229 --> 00:33:20,511
but also for the stories.

768
00:33:21,351 --> 00:33:24,315
And it allowed us to bridge the real world of Sesame Street

769
00:33:24,575 --> 00:33:27,438
with the fictional world of our game and our monsters.

770
00:33:28,244 --> 00:33:30,345
The second thing that we did was just took our narrator,

771
00:33:30,786 --> 00:33:32,927
this person who provided exposition and context,

772
00:33:33,247 --> 00:33:35,388
and we replaced him with Cookie Monster and Elmo,

773
00:33:35,428 --> 00:33:37,029
that they would now become our guides.

774
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:39,431
They would have the same function in the world,

775
00:33:39,511 --> 00:33:41,332
but because they're physical monsters,

776
00:33:41,612 --> 00:33:43,193
they could be part of the game world.

777
00:33:43,473 --> 00:33:44,634
And because they're part of the world,

778
00:33:44,694 --> 00:33:46,935
they could be physical and funny and personable

779
00:33:47,336 --> 00:33:48,977
in a way that a disembodied narrator

780
00:33:49,037 --> 00:33:49,837
never could have been.

781
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:55,881
Lastly, to make a Sesame product meant that we had to be educational. We couldn't, we

782
00:33:55,901 --> 00:34:00,263
didn't want to be the Tickle Me Elmo of Sesame Street video games. But we also knew that

783
00:34:00,283 --> 00:34:03,684
we had to be, you know, entertaining at the same time. And when you think about classic

784
00:34:03,704 --> 00:34:08,386
Sesame Street, you think of numeracy and literacy, ABCs and 123s. Well, for us, that was not

785
00:34:08,426 --> 00:34:12,607
going to work. It's too didactic, it's too dull, it's very age-specific. Instead, what

786
00:34:12,647 --> 00:34:16,668
we want to do is focus on Sesame Street's emotional curriculum, their curriculum about

787
00:34:17,089 --> 00:34:20,611
sharing, empathy, compassion, the identification of emotions.

788
00:34:20,971 --> 00:34:23,512
These things, we thought, would be really consistent

789
00:34:23,532 --> 00:34:26,134
with our original vision of a game about joy.

790
00:34:26,374 --> 00:34:28,115
And rather than just making players happy,

791
00:34:28,415 --> 00:34:31,137
we could actually inspire them and teach them a little bit

792
00:34:31,437 --> 00:34:33,098
about how to be better human beings.

793
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,320
So we made that game, and it looks like this.

794
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,741
And we called it Sesame Street Once Upon a Monster,

795
00:34:38,761 --> 00:34:40,022
and that's the game that we shipped.

796
00:34:41,302 --> 00:34:43,683
So, throughout all this, the biggest lesson that I learned

797
00:34:43,703 --> 00:34:46,105
is that you really have to know your vision in order

798
00:34:46,145 --> 00:34:49,206
to stick to it, especially in difficult changing times.

799
00:34:49,466 --> 00:34:51,507
For us, that was a game about creating joy.

800
00:34:52,047 --> 00:34:53,368
And not only do you need to know your vision,

801
00:34:53,388 --> 00:34:54,429
you need to keep it simple.

802
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:56,349
It needs to be one sentence or less.

803
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:58,991
And it should focus on the experience of the product,

804
00:34:59,311 --> 00:35:01,712
not just a mechanic or a hook or an art direction

805
00:35:01,752 --> 00:35:02,993
or a monetization strategy,

806
00:35:03,013 --> 00:35:05,034
but how do people feel having played it?

807
00:35:05,054 --> 00:35:07,155
And once you know that, you need to tell the team

808
00:35:07,215 --> 00:35:08,095
and tell them often.

809
00:35:08,535 --> 00:35:10,897
because if your game is gonna be changing all the time,

810
00:35:10,937 --> 00:35:13,058
your team are the ones really grappling with that.

811
00:35:13,358 --> 00:35:15,239
And if they don't know, if they've lost sight

812
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,221
of what the vision is, you'll lose sight of it too.

813
00:35:18,261 --> 00:35:19,702
And that little beating heart of your game

814
00:35:19,842 --> 00:35:20,683
is gonna go away.

815
00:35:21,805 --> 00:35:24,646
So really, in the end, a remarkable amount of change

816
00:35:24,686 --> 00:35:25,286
is possible.

817
00:35:25,306 --> 00:35:27,387
You can see where we started and see where we ended.

818
00:35:27,707 --> 00:35:30,308
But ultimately, only because we knew and were able to stay

819
00:35:30,348 --> 00:35:34,649
true to the core idea of our vision of a game about joy.

820
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:36,910
So that's all cool.

821
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:39,671
It's great to know our idea, our vision for one title.

822
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:41,552
But we were making four games.

823
00:35:41,612 --> 00:35:43,692
And so how about our vision for our brand?

824
00:35:43,732 --> 00:35:45,493
What were we going to run into there?

825
00:35:45,513 --> 00:35:47,994
And to talk about that, my excellent colleague, Mr. Brad

826
00:35:48,014 --> 00:35:50,714
Muir, lead of Iron Brigade, is going to come up and talk to

827
00:35:50,734 --> 00:35:51,135
you about that.

828
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,711
Thank you, sir. How are we doing on time? Are we okay?

829
00:35:56,731 --> 00:35:58,992
For your freedom. For your family.

830
00:36:00,253 --> 00:36:01,334
For your children.

831
00:36:03,255 --> 00:36:07,497
The MonoVision menace has destroyed our army, our navy, our air force.

832
00:36:09,498 --> 00:36:10,718
Who is left to fight?

833
00:36:19,543 --> 00:36:20,243
Hey!

834
00:36:21,604 --> 00:36:22,224
Hey, I'm Brad.

835
00:36:23,193 --> 00:36:27,415
So I was the project lead on Trenched, and then I was the project lead on Iron Brigade.

836
00:36:30,156 --> 00:36:35,938
So, um, 2007 Amnesia Fortnight, I was in that, uh, the class of 2007 Amnesia Fortnight with

837
00:36:35,978 --> 00:36:39,899
Nathan, and, uh, you know, we were gonna make a game, and my inspiration at the time, I

838
00:36:39,999 --> 00:36:43,840
was deeply involved in, uh, Brutal Legend.

839
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:47,546
and i really like as a game designer really like uh... core mechanic matchup

840
00:36:47,626 --> 00:36:48,047
that stuff

841
00:36:48,547 --> 00:36:51,713
like deconstructing mechanics from different games and they have a plan

842
00:36:51,733 --> 00:36:53,696
together and see what you get and hopefully it's great

843
00:36:54,438 --> 00:36:57,743
uh... so i was looking at uh... make shooters a lot of mess mecca salt

844
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:02,093
really love that game. You know there's a lot of customization and the combat's really

845
00:37:02,133 --> 00:37:06,377
fun and I love the perspective and just lots of things to love about that game. And then

846
00:37:06,538 --> 00:37:10,441
I was looking at tower defense games also. I think that's defense grid and I love defense

847
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:13,925
grid. And there's just so many awesome decisions that you're making when you're playing it.

848
00:37:15,209 --> 00:37:17,991
a tower defense game about where you're going to put your uh... towers and how you're going

849
00:37:18,011 --> 00:37:20,053
to spend your resources and where the enemies are coming from

850
00:37:20,433 --> 00:37:22,776
so i really wanted to like put those two things together in a game

851
00:37:23,296 --> 00:37:27,400
uh... i also wanted to make a game that focused heavily on co-op because uh...

852
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,563
like i think gears of war had come out recently and i was really liking the

853
00:37:30,583 --> 00:37:32,324
trend in the industry to sort of shift to co-op

854
00:37:32,845 --> 00:37:32,985
uh...

855
00:37:33,445 --> 00:37:34,747
my brother had moved away

856
00:37:35,787 --> 00:37:37,969
And this is, that's him on my back there.

857
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:41,793
And this is like our primary method of keeping in touch.

858
00:37:41,853 --> 00:37:45,016
So I really wanted it to be a game that we could play together.

859
00:37:45,737 --> 00:37:46,978
And I didn't realize it at the time,

860
00:37:47,058 --> 00:37:49,040
but I also wanted to continue that positivity

861
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,282
and, you know, make this a game about love.

862
00:37:52,663 --> 00:37:55,586
It's really important to me that, you know,

863
00:37:55,966 --> 00:37:56,987
much like Once Upon a Monster,

864
00:37:57,027 --> 00:37:59,409
we try to inject more positivity into the industry.

865
00:38:00,766 --> 00:38:04,109
And, you know, how better to do that than with guns and mechs and explosions.

866
00:38:05,171 --> 00:38:09,335
So the Amnesia Fortnite prototype, I really didn't want to focus on the core mechanics,

867
00:38:09,756 --> 00:38:15,502
so I just picked like a very, very kind of off-the-shelf steampunk Britain setting for the game.

868
00:38:15,843 --> 00:38:17,565
So the players are tasked with defending this...

869
00:38:19,127 --> 00:38:20,427
uh... this giant steam factory

870
00:38:20,447 --> 00:38:23,828
uh... and they're piloting these mobile factories and they can make defenses

871
00:38:23,848 --> 00:38:27,309
around the map and there are these uh... zombie robots that will come out at night

872
00:38:27,389 --> 00:38:28,269
and assault their factory

873
00:38:28,689 --> 00:38:31,690
so uh... the game look like this we called it custodians of the clock

874
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:36,051
uh... and that is the worst name please never repeat that uh... because the

875
00:38:36,071 --> 00:38:38,752
custodian people don't think of a cool guy driving a mech

876
00:38:39,212 --> 00:38:40,132
they think about other stuff

877
00:38:41,458 --> 00:38:44,240
So that would have to change, but a lot of other stuff would have to change also.

878
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:50,465
So our big production challenge in the game is that, you know, this is a game that's inspired by core mechanics.

879
00:38:51,025 --> 00:38:55,168
And, you know, the players that have played our games, like, you know, that's not very double fine.

880
00:38:55,188 --> 00:39:00,252
Like, that's not really how Tim has always, like, traditionally come up with game ideas and made games.

881
00:39:00,993 --> 00:39:03,935
So, yeah, it's like Tim is a top-down designer.

882
00:39:03,955 --> 00:39:06,937
He comes up with the fiction and the world and the...

883
00:39:07,662 --> 00:39:11,707
uh... you know all of the all of the the dressing for the game in the in the

884
00:39:11,827 --> 00:39:13,589
setting the fiction and all that stuff and then

885
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:15,291
works down to the core mechanics

886
00:39:15,692 --> 00:39:17,974
and on the on the other way i go bottom up

887
00:39:19,136 --> 00:39:20,157
i start with the uh...

888
00:39:21,076 --> 00:39:21,597
That's weird.

889
00:39:22,598 --> 00:39:25,282
I start with the, that's not what I, come on.

890
00:39:26,944 --> 00:39:28,165
So I start with the core mechanics

891
00:39:28,306 --> 00:39:29,567
and then build from there

892
00:39:29,968 --> 00:39:32,151
and then add fiction and a world on top of it.

893
00:39:32,531 --> 00:39:34,654
So that's the real question is that

894
00:39:34,694 --> 00:39:37,478
can these approaches work inside the same company?

895
00:39:37,858 --> 00:39:40,799
Because, you know, talking with Tim, it's important that we stand for something.

896
00:39:40,819 --> 00:39:43,580
We have all these creative voices that are now, like, being expressed,

897
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,100
and we can't just be all over the map.

898
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:48,281
Like, we want to make sure that we're still kind of in the same domain together.

899
00:39:48,701 --> 00:39:51,702
So is it possible for the game to be different and yet still double fine?

900
00:39:52,522 --> 00:39:57,324
So we kind of examined what our brand was to people who played our game.

901
00:39:57,384 --> 00:40:00,524
So from the outside looking in, we thought that players really like the stories,

902
00:40:00,945 --> 00:40:02,945
they really like the funny cutscenes that are in the game.

903
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,881
and they really like the characters.

904
00:40:05,482 --> 00:40:07,563
So what was it really?

905
00:40:07,783 --> 00:40:08,744
We kind of thought about it,

906
00:40:09,244 --> 00:40:11,706
and the answer was that we just, we didn't know.

907
00:40:13,007 --> 00:40:15,688
So we decided to, you know, explore this

908
00:40:15,748 --> 00:40:16,989
and try to figure it out before we

909
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:19,191
made modifications to Custodians.

910
00:40:20,183 --> 00:40:23,247
So the first one, the story, we decided after talking about it

911
00:40:23,267 --> 00:40:25,470
that it really wasn't about a great deep story.

912
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:27,052
It was more about originality, is

913
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:30,096
that all these games are set in original fantasy worlds

914
00:40:30,236 --> 00:40:32,559
and that that's very important to our core brand.

915
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:36,404
So trying to add originality to Iron Brigade.

916
00:40:37,267 --> 00:40:40,309
We're taking the original 2007 setting of Steampunk Britain.

917
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:44,193
And it just felt a little too prepackaged.

918
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:46,074
It felt like someone else's original idea.

919
00:40:46,175 --> 00:40:48,256
So we really wanted to attack this and make

920
00:40:48,276 --> 00:40:49,297
the game a lot more original.

921
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:53,101
So we held the first ever Double Fine Art Jam.

922
00:40:53,561 --> 00:40:55,543
So we grabbed the entire 2D concept art team

923
00:40:55,583 --> 00:40:56,203
for a couple of days.

924
00:40:57,064 --> 00:41:00,245
And this generated a really high number of ridiculous ideas.

925
00:41:00,946 --> 00:41:03,867
So the first one, Scott Campbell came up with this idea

926
00:41:03,927 --> 00:41:05,947
for these giant castle robots.

927
00:41:05,967 --> 00:41:09,629
So you had these chivalrous knights driving these big, huge robots,

928
00:41:09,669 --> 00:41:12,070
and they're super awesome.

929
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:14,131
But we thought that was a little out there.

930
00:41:15,877 --> 00:41:18,719
Mark Hamer had an idea to use Hieronymus Bosch.

931
00:41:18,739 --> 00:41:19,460
I don't know if you know this guy.

932
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:22,683
We used him on a lot of his work on Brutal Legend to

933
00:41:22,723 --> 00:41:24,245
inspire the tainted coil.

934
00:41:24,585 --> 00:41:27,308
But he had an idea to make Bosch robots that would be

935
00:41:27,348 --> 00:41:28,909
attacking you, and they're all super creepy and weird.

936
00:41:30,647 --> 00:41:33,069
And then another one that we didn't use, Bagel came up with this idea,

937
00:41:33,749 --> 00:41:34,830
is that there were, um,

938
00:41:35,531 --> 00:41:38,174
he thought that the heroes would be the founding fathers of the United States

939
00:41:38,574 --> 00:41:42,297
and that they would pilot robots that were, uh, you know, giant versions of their own

940
00:41:42,357 --> 00:41:44,199
heads. See, there's the Ben Franklin one and then

941
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:47,002
the George Washington one is up there and it has wooden teeth.

942
00:41:47,742 --> 00:41:50,885
And that was a little bit too out there, so we just decided that we would cherry

943
00:41:50,905 --> 00:41:52,407
pick the best ideas that came out of there.

944
00:41:53,147 --> 00:41:53,768
Uh, so...

945
00:41:54,784 --> 00:41:57,787
I really liked Lee Petty, the handsome Lee Petty right here,

946
00:41:57,827 --> 00:42:00,929
came up with this idea of like makeshift World War I stuff.

947
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:03,331
You know, you see this tea drinking guy on his tractor

948
00:42:03,352 --> 00:42:04,633
with a bunch of guns on it and stuff,

949
00:42:04,693 --> 00:42:06,474
and this big smokestack cannon that came off

950
00:42:06,494 --> 00:42:08,016
of a big cruise liner.

951
00:42:08,036 --> 00:42:09,217
And I just thought that was so awesome.

952
00:42:09,237 --> 00:42:11,258
I love the idea of like found technology,

953
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:13,500
and it really fit the sort of like post-apocalyptic thing

954
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:14,621
that I was interested in.

955
00:42:15,835 --> 00:42:18,676
And then Scott Campbell had this idea for these TV smoke

956
00:42:18,736 --> 00:42:19,216
monsters.

957
00:42:20,316 --> 00:42:22,697
And so these were like amorphous shapes that have

958
00:42:22,717 --> 00:42:25,197
these TVs in them, and you had to blast the TVs.

959
00:42:25,217 --> 00:42:26,537
And this was the basis for our enemies.

960
00:42:27,177 --> 00:42:30,278
And then Lee also had this other awesome idea that went

961
00:42:30,318 --> 00:42:32,598
along with his makeshift World War I stuff, and that was

962
00:42:32,638 --> 00:42:33,939
these big cruise liners with legs.

963
00:42:33,999 --> 00:42:35,699
So boats with legs, awesome.

964
00:42:36,019 --> 00:42:37,879
And this made it almost all the way into the shipping

965
00:42:37,919 --> 00:42:40,720
version of the game, where the USS McKinley that you see for

966
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,080
the Mobile Trench Brigade has four legs, is a giant aircraft

967
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:43,820
carrier, and it's awesome.

968
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,382
So we kind of took these three major elements

969
00:42:46,422 --> 00:42:48,584
and put them together, and we came up with the concept

970
00:42:48,624 --> 00:42:49,325
of the mobile trench.

971
00:42:49,625 --> 00:42:52,027
So it's like a small open top mech with the sandbags on it

972
00:42:52,067 --> 00:42:52,747
and a bunch of guns.

973
00:42:53,068 --> 00:42:54,068
You can see the pilot in there.

974
00:42:54,609 --> 00:42:57,591
And then we wanted them to be fighting these TV monsters.

975
00:42:58,092 --> 00:43:00,113
So this was our first stab at both of these.

976
00:43:00,153 --> 00:43:02,215
And then through iteration, we came up

977
00:43:02,255 --> 00:43:04,497
with a more blocky design for the mobile trench

978
00:43:04,537 --> 00:43:05,457
that you see in the shipping game.

979
00:43:05,818 --> 00:43:08,080
And then we came up with a more creepy, organic look

980
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:10,001
for the mono-visions that you see.

981
00:43:11,122 --> 00:43:15,225
Okay, so we talked about how the, you know, what people really want, like the first core

982
00:43:15,265 --> 00:43:16,165
thing is originality.

983
00:43:16,946 --> 00:43:21,129
So looking at the funny cutscenes, we decided that the second thing was really personality

984
00:43:21,209 --> 00:43:21,629
for the game.

985
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:25,952
You know, our games have like tons of personality and it's not necessarily about the funny cutscenes,

986
00:43:26,012 --> 00:43:28,134
it's just about like that they're dripping with personality.

987
00:43:28,674 --> 00:43:33,278
So to attack this problem, I decided that I really wanted to involve the whole team.

988
00:43:34,158 --> 00:43:36,920
You know, the company's awesome and Tim Myers is awesome people.

989
00:43:37,441 --> 00:43:38,602
I, I, yeah, I think so.

990
00:43:39,263 --> 00:43:43,328
And your team has been, has been soaking in your company culture

991
00:43:43,428 --> 00:43:44,930
for a really long time.

992
00:43:45,391 --> 00:43:48,014
And that they literally are your company culture.

993
00:43:48,094 --> 00:43:50,817
So if we can take ideas from them and inject them directly into the game,

994
00:43:51,118 --> 00:43:52,579
the game's just going to have a lot more personality.

995
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:54,762
It's going to feel like a game that comes out of our studio.

996
00:43:55,303 --> 00:43:56,524
So this is Raz.

997
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:02,862
And he is, yeah Raz! He's a concept artist on the game.

998
00:44:03,423 --> 00:44:07,504
And he had this great idea for using these men's magazine covers from the 40s and 50s.

999
00:44:07,944 --> 00:44:11,686
And this was a really awesome inspiration for the game. I love the over the top manly

1000
00:44:11,746 --> 00:44:16,507
men and the machismo. It's like very satirical to take this and sort of make fun of it. Also

1001
00:44:16,547 --> 00:44:20,669
a lot of these covers, there's a whole subset of them that I love where it's men fighting

1002
00:44:20,709 --> 00:44:24,330
little tiny animals. I don't know, it's very very strange.

1003
00:44:24,891 --> 00:44:25,211
But we

1004
00:44:28,198 --> 00:44:30,879
We used these and sort of made, you know, we made our own versions of them.

1005
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:35,021
And this kind of formed the aesthetic backbone of the whole game.

1006
00:44:35,361 --> 00:44:38,422
You know, using these men's magazine covers, the topography is awesome,

1007
00:44:38,482 --> 00:44:39,923
and they're just awesome, I love them.

1008
00:44:40,603 --> 00:44:43,525
So this is Chris Journey, and he's the lead programmer.

1009
00:44:43,725 --> 00:44:44,865
And he's also in the front row right there.

1010
00:44:45,686 --> 00:44:47,887
He was the lead programmer around Trent, Iron Brigade.

1011
00:44:48,927 --> 00:44:50,348
And he had this great idea.

1012
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:52,951
Actually, I didn't think it was a great idea at first.

1013
00:44:53,871 --> 00:44:55,412
He had this idea that in between the missions,

1014
00:44:55,432 --> 00:44:56,953
you're running your trench marine around

1015
00:44:57,133 --> 00:44:57,914
on the deck of the ship,

1016
00:44:58,234 --> 00:45:00,295
and that you could use the right analog trigger

1017
00:45:00,395 --> 00:45:01,176
to like salute.

1018
00:45:01,836 --> 00:45:03,998
And I was like, that's the dumbest idea I've ever heard.

1019
00:45:04,018 --> 00:45:07,019
I hate you and I would fire you if I could.

1020
00:45:09,601 --> 00:45:11,022
But I asked him, I was like, how long will it take?

1021
00:45:11,082 --> 00:45:12,222
And he's like, it'll take two days

1022
00:45:12,283 --> 00:45:13,223
and one day of an animator.

1023
00:45:13,243 --> 00:45:14,924
And I was like, all right, fine, you can try it.

1024
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:15,805
Fine.

1025
00:45:16,473 --> 00:45:20,295
and he went and did it and uh... we playtested it and everybody just totally

1026
00:45:20,315 --> 00:45:22,176
loved it and they ate it up and it was awesome

1027
00:45:22,777 --> 00:45:25,798
and i have since been swayed and our buddies over at giant bomb turned it into this

1028
00:45:25,838 --> 00:45:27,519
big like weird meme thing and it was

1029
00:45:27,799 --> 00:45:29,801
it really helped us grow the community it was just very like

1030
00:45:30,081 --> 00:45:33,003
you know it was it was something unique and original and gave the game a lot of

1031
00:45:33,023 --> 00:45:33,503
personality

1032
00:45:34,083 --> 00:45:37,265
uh... this is Jeff Solis he is the lead artist of Iron Brigade

1033
00:45:38,205 --> 00:45:41,469
and uh... so i had this giant spreadsheet with all these weapons that

1034
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:44,273
i wanted to have in the game and i felt like it was way too big it was like a

1035
00:45:44,313 --> 00:45:46,356
hundred and fifty plus or something stupid like that

1036
00:45:46,917 --> 00:45:49,881
and uh... i just gave it to him and i was like hey will you you know you wanna

1037
00:45:49,981 --> 00:45:50,642
just make of

1038
00:45:50,882 --> 00:45:51,743
bunch of these guns

1039
00:45:52,464 --> 00:45:55,508
and you know i thought he was going to come back and be like oh i'll give you half

1040
00:45:55,949 --> 00:45:57,910
But, no, he was like, yeah, I'll do that.

1041
00:45:57,950 --> 00:45:58,830
I'll just do all those.

1042
00:45:59,391 --> 00:46:00,111
And I was like, sweet.

1043
00:46:00,231 --> 00:46:02,773
And he just came up with all these crazy guns on his own.

1044
00:46:02,813 --> 00:46:04,654
There was not a lot of time for concept art or anything.

1045
00:46:04,714 --> 00:46:06,755
He was just, you know, cranking these out.

1046
00:46:06,775 --> 00:46:08,516
And they all have unique reload animations.

1047
00:46:08,636 --> 00:46:09,817
And they're just awesome.

1048
00:46:09,837 --> 00:46:11,778
They gave the game a ton of personality.

1049
00:46:12,638 --> 00:46:14,319
OK, so we talked about that's the second core thing

1050
00:46:14,379 --> 00:46:16,401
for the Double Fine brand, is personality.

1051
00:46:16,481 --> 00:46:19,622
So the third one are the really memorable characters.

1052
00:46:20,643 --> 00:46:21,884
And, you know, we thought about it.

1053
00:46:21,924 --> 00:46:22,744
And it turns out that.

1054
00:46:23,674 --> 00:46:25,535
Yeah, it's really memorable characters.

1055
00:46:25,575 --> 00:46:26,776
You guys totally nailed that one.

1056
00:46:26,956 --> 00:46:30,699
One of the problems was that it's really difficult to

1057
00:46:30,759 --> 00:46:32,661
inject character into a mech game.

1058
00:46:33,461 --> 00:46:34,882
I'm not pigging on mech assault here.

1059
00:46:34,902 --> 00:46:35,503
I love that game.

1060
00:46:35,603 --> 00:46:40,006
But the mech is so big, and the human that's piling in it,

1061
00:46:40,507 --> 00:46:43,830
that would be a mech warrior, is so tiny that you can't even

1062
00:46:43,870 --> 00:46:48,233
see him, and it's really hard to actually get a character

1063
00:46:48,373 --> 00:46:49,234
really, really in there.

1064
00:46:49,574 --> 00:46:52,156
So our solution was the open top mechs, the mobile trenches.

1065
00:46:52,837 --> 00:46:55,237
So if we peel the top off of it and make it a lot smaller,

1066
00:46:55,277 --> 00:46:57,158
the human's going to be a lot larger,

1067
00:46:57,178 --> 00:46:58,919
and he'll be a lot more visible.

1068
00:46:58,939 --> 00:47:00,299
So we can do things like here, he's

1069
00:47:00,979 --> 00:47:02,100
drinking a whole bottle of whiskey

1070
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:05,201
after completing a mission, or lighting a cigar with a pistol.

1071
00:47:05,261 --> 00:47:07,721
Like a lot of these manly things from the men's magazines

1072
00:47:07,761 --> 00:47:09,942
can really shine when the mech's a lot smaller.

1073
00:47:10,942 --> 00:47:14,023
Another place where we added more character into the game

1074
00:47:14,063 --> 00:47:15,564
was the commander of the Mobile Trench Brigade.

1075
00:47:15,904 --> 00:47:19,045
He wasn't really a major gameplay piece at all.

1076
00:47:19,105 --> 00:47:22,166
He was just a dude on the ship that gives you missions.

1077
00:47:22,816 --> 00:47:26,660
So, you know, we thought about having maybe like one different character for each of the

1078
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:29,062
theaters that you go through and, you know, it was kind of boring.

1079
00:47:29,803 --> 00:47:34,287
But then Tim and Peter Chan came up with this idea that maybe the commander can be confined

1080
00:47:34,307 --> 00:47:36,830
to this iron lung, which is a really creepy contraption.

1081
00:47:37,811 --> 00:47:38,872
And Peter's first take on it...

1082
00:47:39,878 --> 00:47:41,539
was a little weird.

1083
00:47:41,659 --> 00:47:44,701
He had this upright iron lung that's,

1084
00:47:45,041 --> 00:47:46,502
yeah, we're not super into that.

1085
00:47:46,742 --> 00:47:49,424
But just going with a more traditional iron lung

1086
00:47:49,444 --> 00:47:51,645
that had these little mechanical arms on it

1087
00:47:51,705 --> 00:47:54,467
was really cool and created a really memorable character

1088
00:47:54,507 --> 00:47:56,409
that you're interacting with all the time on the ship.

1089
00:47:56,729 --> 00:47:58,990
And it just really helped us hit that.

1090
00:47:59,881 --> 00:48:03,863
So yeah, the Double Fine brand, we really feel like it's about originality,

1091
00:48:03,923 --> 00:48:05,484
personality, and memorable characters.

1092
00:48:05,564 --> 00:48:08,266
But through this process, we also learned that it's about another thing,

1093
00:48:08,406 --> 00:48:10,287
and that's the element of surprise.

1094
00:48:10,927 --> 00:48:15,170
And Iron Brigade, as a game, was kind of already doing this.

1095
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:16,991
Nobody really expected us to make a shooter.

1096
00:48:17,471 --> 00:48:20,293
But by making it and by going through this exercise,

1097
00:48:20,333 --> 00:48:23,334
we just really feel that we want our fans to expect the unexpected.

1098
00:48:23,395 --> 00:48:25,776
Like the next game that we announce will just be something

1099
00:48:25,816 --> 00:48:27,657
that nobody saw coming, and that's really important to us.

1100
00:48:28,771 --> 00:48:31,994
So the lessons that we learned from going through this process,

1101
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:34,116
like you really want to identify your brand as soon as you can.

1102
00:48:35,337 --> 00:48:37,378
And it really just helps drive your decision making.

1103
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:40,942
Also, you shouldn't be beholden to what other people think

1104
00:48:40,962 --> 00:48:41,762
your brand is about.

1105
00:48:42,143 --> 00:48:43,964
It's really up to you to define it,

1106
00:48:43,984 --> 00:48:45,265
to really put a stake in the ground

1107
00:48:45,906 --> 00:48:46,887
and tell people what it is.

1108
00:48:48,108 --> 00:48:49,209
And then also, you should always be

1109
00:48:49,229 --> 00:48:51,931
on the lookout for opportunities to apply

1110
00:48:51,971 --> 00:48:53,372
your brand's fundamentals to your game

1111
00:48:53,652 --> 00:48:54,713
without disrupting its core.

1112
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:59,659
and now we're gonna check out a video of the uh... the transformation of these

1113
00:48:59,699 --> 00:49:00,159
three games

1114
00:49:00,619 --> 00:49:03,560
uh... from their amnesia fortnight versions into their shipping versions

1115
00:49:17,945 --> 00:49:18,125
the

1116
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:18,345
the

1117
00:49:18,405 --> 00:49:18,545
the

1118
00:49:18,605 --> 00:49:18,765
the

1119
00:49:18,845 --> 00:49:18,945
her

1120
00:49:59,277 --> 00:49:59,441
you

1121
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:41,241
Oh, hello again.

1122
00:50:45,384 --> 00:50:48,026
So just a couple of quick takeaways.

1123
00:50:48,046 --> 00:50:49,667
First takeaway is these guys rock.

1124
00:50:49,688 --> 00:50:51,849
These guys have a big hand for Lee and Nathan and Brad,

1125
00:50:52,770 --> 00:50:53,771
and also Tasha.

1126
00:50:57,498 --> 00:51:09,245
That's as well. It was really important to this whole process that I was able to let these guys run their own projects and not have to, you know, they had full autonomy and I could trust them to get these things done, which is really important to it.

1127
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:13,528
I think going into multiple teams like this allowed

1128
00:51:13,548 --> 00:51:15,490
Double Fine to become really agile, which led to our

1129
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:15,970
survival.

1130
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:19,233
I mean, I think if we were married to one plan, one type

1131
00:51:19,273 --> 00:51:21,535
of game, one platform, one device, we would be out of

1132
00:51:21,555 --> 00:51:22,075
business by now.

1133
00:51:22,316 --> 00:51:24,617
We now have multiple teams so we can try things.

1134
00:51:24,637 --> 00:51:26,219
And if they don't work out, we can move into another

1135
00:51:26,259 --> 00:51:28,521
direction, and it's really made us a lot healthier as a

1136
00:51:28,581 --> 00:51:29,582
company.

1137
00:51:29,942 --> 00:51:31,703
Having multiple teams allows the team, like I mentioned

1138
00:51:31,723 --> 00:51:32,404
before, to grow.

1139
00:51:32,484 --> 00:51:34,546
Everybody can move up into leadership roles, and we can

1140
00:51:34,566 --> 00:51:37,608
try someone out on a two-week prototype without risking the

1141
00:51:37,628 --> 00:51:38,389
whole company on them.

1142
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:39,970
And then if they work out, give them.

1143
00:51:40,451 --> 00:51:41,371
a bigger project later on.

1144
00:51:42,152 --> 00:51:46,594
And as a company, now that we can really diversify, we might

1145
00:51:46,634 --> 00:51:49,475
not have wanted to try a licensed product like Sesame

1146
00:51:49,495 --> 00:51:51,576
Street, Once Upon a Monster, if it was going to define our

1147
00:51:51,596 --> 00:51:52,216
entire company.

1148
00:51:52,256 --> 00:51:54,517
Now we're doing licensed properties, or even a Kinect

1149
00:51:54,557 --> 00:51:57,098
game, or we're doing a mobile game, or something like that,

1150
00:51:57,118 --> 00:51:58,299
because people would think, well, that's what they're

1151
00:51:58,319 --> 00:51:58,579
doing now.

1152
00:51:58,599 --> 00:52:00,180
They're a mobile game company all of a sudden.

1153
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:01,781
We can have multiple teams.

1154
00:52:01,821 --> 00:52:03,242
We can try each of these things.

1155
00:52:03,262 --> 00:52:03,922
We can try mobile.

1156
00:52:03,962 --> 00:52:05,023
We can try a free-to-play game.

1157
00:52:05,043 --> 00:52:08,385
We can try to get money from the internet on Kickstarter.

1158
00:52:08,405 --> 00:52:10,447
We can do anything we want, because we have multiple teams

1159
00:52:10,507 --> 00:52:14,429
and we're really just sending a recon team out to investigate

1160
00:52:14,449 --> 00:52:15,250
that opportunity for us.

1161
00:52:15,810 --> 00:52:18,412
And I think the biggest takeaway for me was that

1162
00:52:19,793 --> 00:52:25,100
is about core principles not just like how important it is to stick to your core principles when you are doing a major

1163
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:31,828
transition but actually you can use your core principles to make that transition happen. And for me it was finding out

1164
00:52:31,868 --> 00:52:37,215
that the core principle of the company the number one thing for me was creativity. And when we had a big blow to our.

1165
00:52:37,695 --> 00:52:41,678
financial stability by losing a multi-million dollar project like Brutal Legend 2 and we're

1166
00:52:41,698 --> 00:52:46,741
worried about going out of business. We weren't bailed out by some big publisher or an angel

1167
00:52:46,761 --> 00:52:50,083
investor. We didn't have a big Kickstarter back then to give us the millions of dollars.

1168
00:52:50,644 --> 00:52:54,286
We weren't saved by anyone except for we looked at the team's creativity and it was really

1169
00:52:54,346 --> 00:52:57,468
our, the creativity of the team that saved our whole company and that was.

1170
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,969
for me, just really a great moment for our

1171
00:53:00,009 --> 00:53:01,530
company to know that we could save ourselves with

1172
00:53:01,570 --> 00:53:02,850
this thing that we've been working on this whole

1173
00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:05,171
time and wanted to identify ourselves with.

1174
00:53:05,191 --> 00:53:07,792
So that's the, the, the summary of our talk,

1175
00:53:07,832 --> 00:53:09,053
and I want to thank you all for coming

1176
00:53:09,093 --> 00:53:10,713
and remind you to fill out your feedback forms,

1177
00:53:10,853 --> 00:53:11,874
and if we have any time now, we can

1178
00:53:11,914 --> 00:53:13,314
take some questions. So thanks for coming.

1179
00:53:17,656 --> 00:53:21,997
So we have, when do we have to get

1180
00:53:22,057 --> 00:53:24,778
out of here? Yeah, three? What? We have nine

1181
00:53:24,798 --> 00:53:25,018
minutes?

1182
00:53:26,044 --> 00:53:28,106
Oh, we're good. Oh, I know, I know we're good. I'm just saying.

1183
00:53:30,227 --> 00:53:32,169
So there are these microphones right over here and here.

1184
00:53:32,549 --> 00:53:35,311
And I see people are running to the doors where they think the microphones are.

1185
00:53:35,351 --> 00:53:38,494
But the microphones are actually kept up here, you guys.

1186
00:53:38,874 --> 00:53:40,896
So I want to get really close. First, you over there. Hello there.

1187
00:53:41,236 --> 00:53:42,877
Hi. I had a question.

1188
00:53:42,957 --> 00:53:47,020
So you had multiple teams for your Amnesia Fortnite,

1189
00:53:47,461 --> 00:53:50,043
but you also have multiple people in your company.

1190
00:53:50,652 --> 00:53:52,813
How did you decide which ideas to run with?

1191
00:53:52,853 --> 00:53:54,813
Like you had your four teams, but there has to be an

1192
00:53:54,853 --> 00:53:58,154
initial selection project or process of these are the ideas

1193
00:53:58,174 --> 00:53:58,814
we're going to run at.

1194
00:53:59,394 --> 00:54:02,055
And I'm sure everyone had an idea, but how do you make that

1195
00:54:02,095 --> 00:54:02,775
final selection?

1196
00:54:03,075 --> 00:54:03,235
Yeah.

1197
00:54:03,455 --> 00:54:04,815
So how did we pick which projects to make?

1198
00:54:04,875 --> 00:54:05,456
I mean, we did Fortnite.

1199
00:54:05,716 --> 00:54:07,036
We had many talented people in the company.

1200
00:54:07,616 --> 00:54:08,516
And there was a combination.

1201
00:54:08,536 --> 00:54:13,017
There was one that was like a solitary thing with just my

1202
00:54:13,257 --> 00:54:14,398
visibility on the whole company.

1203
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:17,698
There's people I've had my eye on for a long time for

1204
00:54:17,818 --> 00:54:20,379
disciplinary reasons like Lee or for, you know.

1205
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:26,545
But there's people who, you know, you can kind of tell like who's got promised, you

1206
00:54:26,565 --> 00:54:30,349
know, and you think, I want to give that person a test and see if they can, what they would

1207
00:54:30,389 --> 00:54:35,574
do, given a little, a chance, given a shot. And then also sometimes when there's a lot

1208
00:54:35,594 --> 00:54:40,799
of, you know, especially we did, we have done it a third time now, and there were so many,

1209
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,582
I just invited submissions from the whole company and there were so many that I had

1210
00:54:43,602 --> 00:54:43,823
to get a...

1211
00:54:44,203 --> 00:54:47,964
kind of a, you know, a little group together of the, um, some of the previous leads and,

1212
00:54:48,204 --> 00:54:51,666
and senior people in the company to like look at all these submissions and really talk it

1213
00:54:51,726 --> 00:54:55,147
through which one we thought fit the company's strategy, tested the right people and did

1214
00:54:55,167 --> 00:54:59,369
the right thing. So, there's a combination of some hand picking but also some, um, just

1215
00:54:59,449 --> 00:55:02,810
really talking through with the team of like which ones worked out the best for us long

1216
00:55:02,830 --> 00:55:04,511
term. So thanks for the question. Yes?

1217
00:55:06,113 --> 00:55:13,376
Did it upset your publisher at all to take people away from the project, Brutal Legend, and have so many people working for two weeks on all these different projects?

1218
00:55:13,676 --> 00:55:15,176
So here was, here's the interesting thing.

1219
00:55:15,917 --> 00:55:19,298
Um, don't always tell your publisher everything.

1220
00:55:20,899 --> 00:55:29,682
Um, I'm trying to figure out the timing on this, because both times, I feel like both times when we were doing Amazing Fortnite, we were, we had the luxury of not having a publisher at that moment.

1221
00:55:29,822 --> 00:55:34,644
We had, we had a very dark period in the middle of Brutal Legend where we were, um, you know, publisher free.

1222
00:55:35,726 --> 00:55:41,692
Um, which was terrifying. And, uh, um, and also after, after brutal legend, we had, we were, you

1223
00:55:41,732 --> 00:55:46,196
know, the contract was over and we had some freedom, but we, um, you know, once we, and

1224
00:55:46,216 --> 00:55:50,240
with, and that's something you really, you only, you don't have to worry about the first time

1225
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:52,982
when you're a single company going to multiple projects, once you have multiple projects,

1226
00:55:53,122 --> 00:55:57,386
there are multiple revenue streams. It's not, everything's not coming. You can't, no one

1227
00:55:57,626 --> 00:56:00,869
founder, no one funder of your company can prove they paid for your amnesia fortnight,

1228
00:56:00,889 --> 00:56:01,850
which is really important because.

1229
00:56:02,632 --> 00:56:04,412
Anyway, it's part of your overhead of your company, and

1230
00:56:04,792 --> 00:56:06,893
it is something that is totally valid to spend your

1231
00:56:06,913 --> 00:56:08,394
money on if you're investing in the future.

1232
00:56:08,614 --> 00:56:11,735
But basically, you lie and say your milestone is going to be

1233
00:56:11,755 --> 00:56:12,756
two weeks later than it really is.

1234
00:56:13,276 --> 00:56:13,896
So, next question.

1235
00:56:17,208 --> 00:56:20,790
Why two weeks, and would you find it to be effective to do more or less than two weeks?

1236
00:56:20,890 --> 00:56:26,333
I didn't bring my maths, my slide rule, which is so I can prove this mathematically perfect amount of time to spend on this.

1237
00:56:26,893 --> 00:56:29,314
But it is, you have to trust me.

1238
00:56:30,235 --> 00:56:33,817
I picked two weeks actually because of that story about Wonka or why I heard it was two weeks and I don't know why.

1239
00:56:34,077 --> 00:56:36,518
Two weeks is this magical amount of time where you feel like you could do anything.

1240
00:56:36,918 --> 00:56:38,199
Like when you're like, when's that task going to be done?

1241
00:56:38,219 --> 00:56:41,160
I think it's going to be done in about two weeks, because that sounds like infinity, basically.

1242
00:56:42,841 --> 00:56:43,922
Two weeks equals infinity.

1243
00:56:44,682 --> 00:56:46,844
And I really think it's more,

1244
00:56:47,004 --> 00:56:48,425
I think it's important to do two instead of one.

1245
00:56:48,445 --> 00:56:49,585
I think one week is just enough time

1246
00:56:49,605 --> 00:56:51,607
to get your team in sync and moving.

1247
00:56:51,767 --> 00:56:53,068
I think two weeks really to do it

1248
00:56:53,468 --> 00:56:54,388
is what helped us get these things

1249
00:56:54,408 --> 00:56:55,829
that were ready to be pitched, I think.

1250
00:56:56,670 --> 00:56:56,930
Thank you.

1251
00:56:58,962 --> 00:57:03,365
I was just wondering, like, where did you start in terms of tech with each of these games?

1252
00:57:03,385 --> 00:57:05,527
Oh, that was a really important thing. Where did we start in terms of tech?

1253
00:57:06,127 --> 00:57:08,989
It would have been really hard to do this if we didn't have the Brutal Engine engine.

1254
00:57:09,049 --> 00:57:13,693
We had the Brutal Engine engine working, and we had tools, a pipeline, and the team knew how to use it.

1255
00:57:14,073 --> 00:57:18,476
And so we could just start day one on the gameplay and the, you know, our direction.

1256
00:57:18,496 --> 00:57:19,297
We didn't have to worry about...

1257
00:57:19,718 --> 00:57:23,082
making an engine any time. But even if you didn't have an engine, there are out of the

1258
00:57:23,122 --> 00:57:27,048
box engines you could use. You could grab one of the things that's out there and use

1259
00:57:27,068 --> 00:57:31,013
that. I wouldn't start and write a whole new engine from scratch in two weeks. It would

1260
00:57:31,033 --> 00:57:32,696
make you spend a lot of time on things that were not right.

1261
00:57:33,122 --> 00:57:35,984
Yeah, we'd actually designed the Brutal Legend engine to be

1262
00:57:36,005 --> 00:57:40,109
to really a thoughtful separation between game specific code and game independent code.

1263
00:57:40,529 --> 00:57:43,652
That's what actually allowed us to basically every Amnesia Fortnite project

1264
00:57:43,672 --> 00:57:45,754
has always started with a little kernel we call a seed.

1265
00:57:46,275 --> 00:57:49,518
And it's just like the most basic game where like it boots, it runs,

1266
00:57:49,558 --> 00:57:52,481
there's a dude, there's a controller input, and then like have fun.

1267
00:57:53,141 --> 00:57:56,905
And I think that like some of the architectural decisions we made very early in Brutal Legend.

1268
00:57:57,225 --> 00:58:01,551
have allowed us to build a code base that can support everything from Once Upon a Monster

1269
00:58:01,611 --> 00:58:06,438
to stacking to trench or Iron Brigade to Happy Action Theater, Costume Quest, you know, it's

1270
00:58:07,219 --> 00:58:09,882
a lot of that is just that top level kind of switching in and out.

1271
00:58:10,443 --> 00:58:11,765
Thank you.

1272
00:58:11,805 --> 00:58:12,105
All right.

1273
00:58:12,125 --> 00:58:13,567
Oh, we have one more question there.

1274
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:17,241
So do you think having these predefined divisions of teams

1275
00:58:17,281 --> 00:58:19,442
really helped have everyone on those teams

1276
00:58:19,762 --> 00:58:20,563
have creative input?

1277
00:58:20,903 --> 00:58:23,584
Or do you think it could have been just as good to have

1278
00:58:23,804 --> 00:58:26,645
these initial ideas and then allocate resources?

1279
00:58:26,665 --> 00:58:29,287
This project needs a lot more artists, or this project is

1280
00:58:29,307 --> 00:58:31,788
much more technically demanding, even though the

1281
00:58:31,808 --> 00:58:34,529
teams might not have started out all being one big family.

1282
00:58:35,349 --> 00:58:36,850
Like are you saying how we split up the team, how we

1283
00:58:36,890 --> 00:58:38,691
chose the teams, how do we split them up?

1284
00:58:38,811 --> 00:58:40,372
You could have done it differently, and it would have

1285
00:58:40,392 --> 00:58:41,552
been more or less creative.

1286
00:58:42,395 --> 00:58:45,718
I mean, the way we split up the teams to do the image of Fortnite is that we, we pick

1287
00:58:45,738 --> 00:58:49,182
the leaders of the teams and who, and we let them pitch their games to the whole company.

1288
00:58:49,622 --> 00:58:52,865
And then everybody got to put a stack rank list of which ones they wanted to work on.

1289
00:58:53,506 --> 00:58:56,649
And then every team lead got to put a stack rank list of who they wanted on the team.

1290
00:58:57,050 --> 00:58:59,933
And then we made an Excel document that actually calculated points for each things and came

1291
00:58:59,973 --> 00:59:04,697
up with this robot-generated list, which was totally not just me filling in slots when

1292
00:59:04,718 --> 00:59:05,198
no one was looking.

1293
00:59:05,218 --> 00:59:06,099
But, I mean, it was like...

1294
00:59:07,439 --> 00:59:11,423
It really was a, we tried to do a balance of what, who wanted to work on what, and who needed who for their project.

1295
00:59:11,483 --> 00:59:14,245
And then the way we would pull some people from here to there.

1296
00:59:14,325 --> 00:59:18,228
And, and that's how we picked it for the team to be a good balance between.

1297
00:59:18,268 --> 00:59:20,170
We just tried to make sure that each team had what it needed.

1298
00:59:20,210 --> 00:59:21,992
Some of the times they had, they had a scramble.

1299
00:59:22,012 --> 00:59:24,274
I remember Brad didn't have a, was it an animator?

1300
00:59:24,294 --> 00:59:25,475
Or you didn't have a concept artist?

1301
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:26,410
didn't have concept artists.

1302
00:59:26,450 --> 00:59:29,032
Didn't have concept artists, but I think Jeff or Randy,

1303
00:59:29,272 --> 00:59:31,014
some of the guys on your team got a chance to draw

1304
00:59:31,354 --> 00:59:32,595
some good concept artists.

1305
00:59:32,615 --> 00:59:33,495
Yeah, yeah, that was cool.

1306
00:59:33,756 --> 00:59:34,716
Just many hats.

1307
00:59:35,197 --> 00:59:37,338
Part of the reason that the original Happy Song prototype

1308
00:59:37,378 --> 00:59:39,860
had no environment was I knew I needed a lot of animators.

1309
00:59:40,641 --> 00:59:42,622
And so I was like, how about no environments?

1310
00:59:42,822 --> 00:59:44,603
And then other people can take the environment artists,

1311
00:59:44,663 --> 00:59:45,924
and I'll take lots of animators.

1312
00:59:45,964 --> 00:59:46,845
And that worked out well.

1313
00:59:46,885 --> 00:59:48,446
And there was some things that were unfair about that,

1314
00:59:48,466 --> 00:59:50,288
but it kind of seems like a draconian,

1315
00:59:50,308 --> 00:59:52,069
but I think I should learn how to fight for resources

1316
00:59:52,129 --> 00:59:53,410
as part of learning how to run a project.

1317
00:59:54,393 --> 00:59:57,155
it sounds dark, isn't it? But it's a, it's

1318
00:59:57,175 --> 00:59:58,916
a, knowing what your project needs and knowing how

1319
00:59:58,936 --> 01:00:00,117
to get it on your project, that's part of

1320
01:00:00,398 --> 01:00:02,659
making a game. So that's part of the trial

1321
01:00:02,699 --> 01:00:03,040
by fire.

1322
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:04,841
Is there time for one more? That's a wave.

1323
01:00:05,121 --> 01:00:06,783
Does that mean go away, or does that mean?

1324
01:00:06,803 --> 01:00:10,205
Oh, we're done. OK. We have to, we have

1325
01:00:10,245 --> 01:00:12,107
to go away. So I don't have time to

1326
01:00:12,147 --> 01:00:13,948
remind you to back our Kickstarter project or the

1327
01:00:13,968 --> 01:00:16,110
stacking's available on PC. So I won't say that. So

1328
01:00:16,330 --> 01:00:16,810
bye. Thank you.
