00:00:05,898 --> 00:00:09,301
Hello, welcome to Failing to Fail the Spiderweb Software Way.

2
00:00:09,321 --> 00:00:14,546
I would like to thank you sincerely for taking a chance on this talk,

3
00:00:14,566 --> 00:00:17,068
being as most of you have no idea who I am,

4
00:00:17,108 --> 00:00:18,990
and I'm keeping you from your day drinking.

5
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:23,695
My name is Jeff Vogel, and I run a company called Spiderweb Software,

6
00:00:23,735 --> 00:00:24,936
which I started in 1994.

7
00:00:26,177 --> 00:00:29,941
We're a little company, two full-time employees now,

8
00:00:29,981 --> 00:00:30,881
it used to be three.

9
00:00:31,727 --> 00:00:36,510
Most people have never, ever heard of us, but we've been around for a very long time.

10
00:01:01,267 --> 00:01:05,089
This is a full list of the full-length games that we have released for money.

11
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:09,051
The games in italics are full remasters.

12
00:01:09,091 --> 00:01:11,092
We don't half-ass our remasters.

13
00:01:11,132 --> 00:01:13,453
When we remaster it, we redo everything.

14
00:01:13,913 --> 00:01:17,095
The other games are completely all-new full-length titles.

15
00:01:17,115 --> 00:01:18,296
And we write pretty big games.

16
00:01:19,977 --> 00:01:21,298
God knows you don't want to count all that.

17
00:01:21,598 --> 00:01:23,639
But it's over the time we've been in business,

18
00:01:23,679 --> 00:01:26,800
we've released 16 full-length all-new games,

19
00:01:27,021 --> 00:01:29,342
and 7 remas- sorry, 8 remasters.

20
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:30,983
What do we do?

21
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:36,534
Well, this is our very first game, Exile Escape from the Pit, which we released in January

22
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:38,134
of 1995.

23
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:45,297
And just to be clear, even by the standards of the time, this was a pretty darn cheap

24
00:01:45,357 --> 00:01:46,018
looking game.

25
00:01:47,138 --> 00:01:53,161
It's adorable, it's functional, it's a clearly recognizable Ultima knockoff, but, you know,

26
00:01:53,401 --> 00:01:55,722
it's cheap and scruffy.

27
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:57,963
In comparison...

28
00:01:58,372 --> 00:02:02,513
About a month and a half ago, we released Avernum 3 Ruined World, which is a remaster

29
00:02:02,713 --> 00:02:07,654
of Avernum 3, which is itself a remaster of Exile 3 Ruined World.

30
00:02:07,954 --> 00:02:12,035
So we've been around long enough that we are doing remasters of remasters.

31
00:02:12,696 --> 00:02:18,857
And if you look at this, I mean, graphically, production values, it's fine.

32
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:21,438
We're not crapping ourselves up there.

33
00:02:21,498 --> 00:02:22,218
It's reasonable.

34
00:02:23,298 --> 00:02:26,259
No one's going to mistake it for a AAA title or something.

35
00:02:26,299 --> 00:02:27,560
But it's basically...

36
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:34,570
functional. We don't write hits. Now don't get me wrong, I have nothing against hits.

37
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:38,113
I would love to have a hit. I think it's a great thing to shoot for. It's just not what we do.

38
00:02:38,633 --> 00:02:45,981
We try to service a respectable niche with competent games in order to sustain a pleasant,

39
00:02:46,161 --> 00:02:50,345
sustainable middle-class income. So why am I up here?

40
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:55,439
Indie developers love and should love postmortems.

41
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:57,399
They love the stories of creating a thing,

42
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:59,480
because you can sort of pick through it magpie-like

43
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,320
and look for elements of the story

44
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,761
that you can use to help yourself.

45
00:03:03,061 --> 00:03:04,881
Well, this is a postmortem, too, except it's not

46
00:03:04,921 --> 00:03:07,122
a postmortem of a game, but of a career,

47
00:03:07,962 --> 00:03:11,123
because I am older than the stones and the dirt.

48
00:03:11,143 --> 00:03:15,004
I have been writing indie games continuously for a living

49
00:03:15,224 --> 00:03:18,305
longer than, I'm not going to say everyone.

50
00:03:18,852 --> 00:03:24,094
but the list of people who have been doing it longer is not long and it's by a matter of months.

51
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:34,000
Indie games as a big thing are new. They're really new. We only became a full big hundred

52
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,922
million dollar a year industry in like the last five or six years. So the idea of how to do a

53
00:03:38,202 --> 00:03:44,365
full career, a 20, 30, 40 year career in this industry is very much an open question. So it's

54
00:03:44,385 --> 00:03:48,267
not talked about much. 40 years, my god, there isn't going to be a planet left then.

55
00:03:48,902 --> 00:03:51,984
So that's why, that's the purpose of this talk,

56
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:53,865
to start approaching this question.

57
00:03:53,905 --> 00:03:55,487
How do you keep the ball rolling?

58
00:03:55,947 --> 00:04:00,270
And so I'm gonna tell you a story about the last 25 years,

59
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:02,452
a couple lame funny anecdotes,

60
00:04:02,912 --> 00:04:05,594
and a couple things that I've observed

61
00:04:05,654 --> 00:04:06,935
about the nature of our industry.

62
00:04:07,695 --> 00:04:10,057
I'm not gonna have any answers for anybody

63
00:04:10,077 --> 00:04:11,718
because you're all your own artists.

64
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:14,600
But perhaps some things I say might help you

65
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,142
to ask a better quality of question.

66
00:04:22,248 --> 00:04:27,950
So this is the old person part of the talk and I've observed that there is nothing that

67
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:34,753
young people hate more than old people talking about what things were like when the world

68
00:04:34,813 --> 00:04:35,153
was young.

69
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:36,854
Who punched cards?

70
00:04:38,855 --> 00:04:42,836
My first computer was a cinder block with a keyboard duct tape to it.

71
00:04:43,277 --> 00:04:46,158
Yeah, there's going to be there's going to be a tiny bit of that, but I promised to try

72
00:04:46,178 --> 00:04:49,419
to round it around to some bring it around to something that might be valuable to you.

73
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:51,069
So how did I get started?

74
00:04:51,349 --> 00:04:53,311
I was a really, really weird kid.

75
00:04:54,511 --> 00:04:57,053
When I was five, I spent all of my time

76
00:04:57,273 --> 00:04:58,874
in my bedroom with a pencil and paper

77
00:04:58,894 --> 00:05:01,116
drawing increasingly elaborate mazes

78
00:05:01,196 --> 00:05:02,376
because they fascinated me.

79
00:05:02,717 --> 00:05:05,318
I was lucky enough to have worried but basically

80
00:05:05,398 --> 00:05:09,181
supportive parents.

81
00:05:09,301 --> 00:05:11,582
1975 or so, my dad went to a bar with friends,

82
00:05:11,682 --> 00:05:12,783
and he came home and said, Jeff, I

83
00:05:12,823 --> 00:05:14,544
saw this weird thing I'd never seen before.

84
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:15,565
I thought you'd find it interesting.

85
00:05:15,945 --> 00:05:18,967
And he described to me a thing called Pong.

86
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:21,757
And he was right, it did sound awful interesting.

87
00:05:21,837 --> 00:05:24,098
But I couldn't try it because even in 1975,

88
00:05:24,718 --> 00:05:27,359
five-year-olds hanging out in bars was not going to fly.

89
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,561
But one year later, on a Washington State ferry,

90
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:32,922
I found this big old wooden box where

91
00:05:32,942 --> 00:05:34,243
you could put a quarter in the front

92
00:05:34,643 --> 00:05:36,965
and you could fire rectangular torpedoes

93
00:05:37,225 --> 00:05:39,126
at these two-dimensional boats for 70 seconds.

94
00:05:39,146 --> 00:05:40,847
And if you did it really well, you

95
00:05:40,887 --> 00:05:42,207
could do it for 20 more seconds.

96
00:05:42,588 --> 00:05:47,250
And even then, my tiny little barely alive pea brain

97
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:48,631
knew that this.

98
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,662
was my thing. This was my bag.

99
00:05:52,723 --> 00:05:54,345
Writing video games for a living

100
00:05:54,925 --> 00:05:56,987
was an idea that compelled me all through my childhood.

101
00:05:57,007 --> 00:05:59,029
All through, I read everything I could about video games,

102
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:01,412
about programming, I played them whenever I got the chance.

103
00:06:02,553 --> 00:06:06,096
When I was 10, I walked into my fourth-grade classroom

104
00:06:06,256 --> 00:06:08,418
and there were people with this weird-looking blue book

105
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:09,520
and some funny-shaped dice.

106
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,342
And once again, I didn't look at it for like two or three seconds

107
00:06:12,362 --> 00:06:14,004
before it had colonized my brain.

108
00:06:14,467 --> 00:06:18,009
And that night, I was bugging my parents, please, oh my god,

109
00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:19,631
take me to the mall so I can buy this.

110
00:06:20,511 --> 00:06:23,133
And that was how I got started with Dungeons and Dragons.

111
00:06:24,174 --> 00:06:26,576
My school library had a program where kids could write books.

112
00:06:26,596 --> 00:06:27,877
And you could put them in the school library,

113
00:06:27,897 --> 00:06:29,158
and then other kids could check them out.

114
00:06:29,578 --> 00:06:32,601
And so I immediately had to learn to type, hunt, and text

115
00:06:32,621 --> 00:06:35,843
style, and I wrote my first D&D module, put it in the library.

116
00:06:36,324 --> 00:06:38,866
Now, the news media at the time, even the most prestigious

117
00:06:39,026 --> 00:06:40,467
outlets, was starting to run stories

118
00:06:40,607 --> 00:06:42,168
about the evil of gamers.

119
00:06:42,631 --> 00:06:49,575
about how there are these treacherous, evil, corrupt, insidious creatures who must be feared

120
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:55,899
a proud media tradition that continues to this day and as a result a concerned parent

121
00:06:55,939 --> 00:07:00,001
called the school library and as a result of that I am the only person I know personally

122
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:07,085
who has had a book banned from a school library. This is the module that I wrote, art also

123
00:07:07,145 --> 00:07:07,465
by me.

124
00:07:08,035 --> 00:07:11,998
the tunnels of Grok, and you will note in the title that I spell the tunnels with the

125
00:07:12,058 --> 00:07:13,920
somewhat less common L-E spelling.

126
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:17,342
What was the point of all that?

127
00:07:19,304 --> 00:07:25,068
I have been gifted with a gift that is almost unprecedented in the whole of human experience.

128
00:07:25,968 --> 00:07:30,051
I am older than the art form in which I work.

129
00:07:30,932 --> 00:07:34,655
Now, this is one of my all-time favorite quotes by William Goldman, writer and screenwriter

130
00:07:34,675 --> 00:07:36,316
best known for making The Princess Bride.

131
00:07:37,484 --> 00:07:38,685
Nobody knows anything.

132
00:07:38,905 --> 00:07:40,706
And he was saying this about the film industry, which

133
00:07:40,746 --> 00:07:43,707
is a far better understood industry than ours.

134
00:07:45,088 --> 00:07:46,308
Video games are young.

135
00:07:46,829 --> 00:07:47,869
Nobody knows anything.

136
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:49,350
We're still scrambling to figure out,

137
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,570
how do we design these things?

138
00:07:50,731 --> 00:07:51,611
How do we create these things?

139
00:07:51,731 --> 00:07:52,571
How do we test these things?

140
00:07:52,711 --> 00:07:53,732
How do we sell these things?

141
00:07:53,892 --> 00:07:54,772
How do we market these things?

142
00:07:54,953 --> 00:07:57,454
How do we add loot boxes to a $100 million project

143
00:07:57,494 --> 00:07:59,795
without causing it to blow up on the launch pad?

144
00:08:01,476 --> 00:08:02,896
Nobody knows anything.

145
00:08:02,956 --> 00:08:04,457
And if you think you know a rule,

146
00:08:04,855 --> 00:08:08,736
one of you out there, your fortune and your fame might be figuring out the way to break that rule.

147
00:08:09,377 --> 00:08:13,978
And, you know, in two days, grown-up GBC is going to start. Real GBC is going to start.

148
00:08:14,178 --> 00:08:17,599
And these halls are going to be filled with Microsoft people, Electronic Arts people,

149
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:21,380
and Activision people walking down the hall like they're too cool for school,

150
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,340
and looking at me like there's something they just scraped off their shoe.

151
00:08:24,661 --> 00:08:28,562
And there's going to be high-powered consultants here whose job is to charge a fortune to stand

152
00:08:28,602 --> 00:08:31,562
in the corner of the room and pretend they're the person who knows something.

153
00:08:32,463 --> 00:08:33,283
Don't be fooled.

154
00:08:34,302 --> 00:08:37,924
Nobody knows anything, and this is your art form just as much as theirs.

155
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:39,385
Sue.

156
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:45,628
Don't patronize me.

157
00:08:46,069 --> 00:08:46,489
Okay.

158
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:52,973
My first game was a thing called Shareware, which was a marketing technique.

159
00:08:53,413 --> 00:08:54,293
What was Shareware?

160
00:08:54,673 --> 00:09:00,036
Well, in 1994, most software was sold in boxes on store shelves, and Shareware is based on

161
00:09:00,076 --> 00:09:02,518
the bananas radical idea.

162
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:06,584
Wait a second, what we're going to do is we're going to write demos of our games, small portions,

163
00:09:07,624 --> 00:09:11,608
and people are free to spread their demos to everyone that they knew.

164
00:09:11,788 --> 00:09:14,570
They could put them up on BBSs, they could put them on Americana Online, they could give

165
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:18,113
copies of the demos to their friends in the off chance they had any.

166
00:09:18,794 --> 00:09:23,558
And if you liked the demo, then you, OK, you pirated it 90% of the time.

167
00:09:23,738 --> 00:09:27,562
But sometimes you've got the full version by sending me money.

168
00:09:28,322 --> 00:09:28,442
Now...

169
00:09:29,452 --> 00:09:34,514
How did you these demos get around and how did the money come back because bear in mind at this time.

170
00:09:35,434 --> 00:09:39,656
There wasn't really an Internet this is we're back to 1994.

171
00:09:41,716 --> 00:09:54,922
There was no real web browser there was no real web most people this is my first 14 4K modem which was capable of downloading my 1.2 megabyte first game demo in a blazing 90 minutes.

172
00:09:57,022 --> 00:09:57,603
You used these.

173
00:09:59,556 --> 00:10:00,757
How was your game distributed?

174
00:10:01,337 --> 00:10:04,299
Well, you could put your demo on AOL, CompuServe, Prodigy.

175
00:10:04,339 --> 00:10:06,860
These were services that cost $3 an hour to be on.

176
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,262
That's how much the internet cost in 1994, $3 an hour.

177
00:10:12,284 --> 00:10:14,905
You could get demos by buying magazines, which

178
00:10:14,945 --> 00:10:17,126
have shareware on disks in the front.

179
00:10:18,107 --> 00:10:20,789
You could go to your local OfficeMax or CompUSA

180
00:10:21,189 --> 00:10:23,950
and spend $10 for a disk with 30 to 200 shareware demos

181
00:10:24,031 --> 00:10:24,791
to try out.

182
00:10:25,511 --> 00:10:25,772
Excuse me.

183
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,842
You want a discoverability problem.

184
00:10:31,142 --> 00:10:32,964
This is a discoverability problem.

185
00:10:33,664 --> 00:10:37,187
And finally, my favorite, you could go to the mall,

186
00:10:37,367 --> 00:10:39,709
and you could go to kiosks, and you could go to shops,

187
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:42,472
and then there were walls covered with disks

188
00:10:42,612 --> 00:10:43,973
with shareware demos on them.

189
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:47,256
So you would go, and you would pay up to $10

190
00:10:47,336 --> 00:10:48,217
for a shareware demo.

191
00:10:48,617 --> 00:10:50,279
You would take it home, you'd put it on your computer,

192
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:51,540
and if you liked it.

193
00:10:52,071 --> 00:10:54,412
You would call me on the phone and say, hey, I got your demo.

194
00:10:54,452 --> 00:10:55,152
I want the full game.

195
00:10:55,212 --> 00:10:57,013
I'd say, hey, the full game is $25.

196
00:10:57,433 --> 00:11:00,415
And then you would say, you freaking con artist,

197
00:11:00,515 --> 00:11:02,015
I paid $10 for this disc.

198
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:04,857
And then proceed to yell at me for upwards of five hours.

199
00:11:06,998 --> 00:11:08,718
So as you liked the game, you wanted to send money back.

200
00:11:09,118 --> 00:11:11,720
You mailed me a check using a stamp.

201
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,021
You would get a postal money order from the post office.

202
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:16,342
You would mail me cash.

203
00:11:16,622 --> 00:11:19,803
One Viking mailed me $25 in change.

204
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:20,804
The envelope went like this.

205
00:11:20,924 --> 00:11:21,924
Ching, ching, ching, ching.

206
00:11:22,716 --> 00:11:25,539
And finally, if you could get a credit card, a bank to trust you,

207
00:11:25,579 --> 00:11:27,981
your small business could gain the ability to accept credit cards,

208
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,082
which almost never happened.

209
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:30,883
Put a pin in that. I'll get back to that later.

210
00:11:31,704 --> 00:11:34,867
So, it's 1994. I'm in grad school, and I hate it.

211
00:11:34,967 --> 00:11:37,549
My wife at the time has already quit grad school

212
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:41,273
and gotten a real job, and we decide to live the dream

213
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,134
and actually own a computer.

214
00:11:44,135 --> 00:11:45,476
I will, as an aside at this point,

215
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:50,925
I have been very lucky in my life in the opportunities I've been given and the background that I

216
00:11:50,965 --> 00:11:53,806
have that just enabled me to learn to program when I was a child.

217
00:11:54,206 --> 00:11:56,827
I want to make it very clear that that fact has not escaped me.

218
00:11:58,268 --> 00:12:02,209
Now here's your standard old person statistics for our first computer which cost about $3,700

219
00:12:03,669 --> 00:12:06,310
of today dollars adjusted for inflation.

220
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:11,952
It came with 8 megabytes of RAM which could be upgraded to a lofty and princely 16 megabytes

221
00:12:11,992 --> 00:12:12,812
for only $680 of today dollars.

222
00:12:14,539 --> 00:12:18,002
I bought Code Warrior to write computer programs because I liked doing that.

223
00:12:18,162 --> 00:12:21,485
And if you wanted to learn to program at the time, there was no Internet, so there were

224
00:12:21,505 --> 00:12:22,306
no discussion groups.

225
00:12:22,526 --> 00:12:25,709
You just went to the local bookstore, you bought books, and you stared at them until

226
00:12:25,749 --> 00:12:28,031
little pinpricks of blood started appearing on your forehead.

227
00:12:30,052 --> 00:12:30,573
Got a computer.

228
00:12:30,793 --> 00:12:32,795
I want to play a role-playing game because that's totally my bag.

229
00:12:33,055 --> 00:12:33,976
But I couldn't find any.

230
00:12:35,237 --> 00:12:37,198
So I figure, what the hell?

231
00:12:37,619 --> 00:12:38,800
There's no role-playing games.

232
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,001
I might as well write one.

233
00:12:40,261 --> 00:12:42,943
And if there had been good role-playing games at the time, I probably never would have written

234
00:12:43,023 --> 00:12:43,103
one.

235
00:12:43,648 --> 00:12:45,529
But I just happened to get another lucky break.

236
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:46,850
You're going to see this chart again.

237
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:49,051
I got into a trough in the business cycle.

238
00:12:49,411 --> 00:12:51,292
What this chart says is that industries

239
00:12:51,332 --> 00:12:55,134
have a tendency to go through boom times and bust times.

240
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:57,536
It is a very important concept to understand.

241
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:59,276
I'll get back to it when I talk about today.

242
00:12:59,296 --> 00:13:01,358
I grad school.

243
00:13:01,798 --> 00:13:03,299
I can live my lifelong dream.

244
00:13:03,459 --> 00:13:04,579
I'm going to sit down, and I'm going

245
00:13:04,619 --> 00:13:06,460
to write a full-length fantasy role-playing game

246
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,981
and, what the hell, release it to try

247
00:13:08,001 --> 00:13:08,881
to get some pizza money.

248
00:13:09,982 --> 00:13:12,743
So now I've got to sit in a room and stare at the wall.

249
00:13:13,678 --> 00:13:14,639
What the heck am I going to do?

250
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,839
I'm going to live my dream, but what am I going to write?

251
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:17,559
How am I going to write it?

252
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,740
So it doesn't take me long.

253
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,580
I come up with the idea.

254
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,720
I loved these games as a kid.

255
00:13:22,181 --> 00:13:23,101
So what I'm going to do is I'm going

256
00:13:23,121 --> 00:13:24,821
to go to every single game I liked as a kid

257
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:27,262
and steal the single best idea from every one.

258
00:13:28,142 --> 00:13:29,602
And I'm going to, in my craftsman way,

259
00:13:29,622 --> 00:13:34,083
amalgamate them into what I hope is a cohesive and satisfying

260
00:13:34,103 --> 00:13:34,363
whole.

261
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,407
Indie games are great for innovation.

262
00:13:37,788 --> 00:13:40,249
I love innovation, but innovation is not the only path.

263
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:42,071
You must remember that every single one of us

264
00:13:42,131 --> 00:13:43,632
stands on the shoulders of giants.

265
00:13:46,334 --> 00:13:49,496
I looked at what I liked to play, and then I copied it.

266
00:13:50,297 --> 00:13:51,617
That is my creative process.

267
00:13:51,657 --> 00:13:54,039
And my second lesson is, this is all gonna be about

268
00:13:54,259 --> 00:13:57,021
finding my creative process, my way of doing business,

269
00:13:57,101 --> 00:13:58,282
and the importance of defending it.

270
00:13:58,642 --> 00:14:01,124
And this is gonna sound like sort of artsy-fartsy,

271
00:14:01,404 --> 00:14:03,686
ooh, follow your bliss, man, advice.

272
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:04,627
No, it's not.

273
00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:08,570
It's very hard-nosed practical advice, and I'll tell you why.

274
00:14:09,231 --> 00:14:12,172
Most of the people you're going to run into in this thing

275
00:14:12,252 --> 00:14:15,293
are looking at their career over a time frame of one year, two

276
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:17,394
years, five years, which is reasonable, especially

277
00:14:17,414 --> 00:14:18,235
if you're trying to get started.

278
00:14:18,435 --> 00:14:19,935
But that's not the time frame I think in.

279
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:23,717
I'm thinking about in 20 years, in 10 years, in 40 years.

280
00:14:24,177 --> 00:14:27,238
I want to know what your career writing shareware games is

281
00:14:27,258 --> 00:14:30,020
going to be like in 40 years.

282
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,041
And that's a long time.

283
00:14:33,511 --> 00:15:03,324
If you're going to work in that length of time and you're going to be operating at a very peak level of efficiency because you need to in this business you need to create a life you need to create a mindset you need to create a process that is not going to rub you because if you if there's something that's rubbing at you if there's something that's putting you off your feed over the next 40 years it is going to rub you down to a nub. So. I'm writing a game I do my grad school stuff during the day and I work on the game at night.

284
00:15:03,674 --> 00:15:06,817
Fortunately, I was in my 20s, so I had infinite energy.

285
00:15:07,397 --> 00:15:10,059
I spent four months hacking out something like an engine.

286
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,381
My wife at the time was enormously supportive.

287
00:15:12,421 --> 00:15:16,405
She drew these adorable little cartoon graphic icons for me

288
00:15:16,885 --> 00:15:19,147
that I still get emails requesting to this day.

289
00:15:20,608 --> 00:15:22,490
I spent about five minutes making the world, placing

290
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:25,272
the walls, placing the swords, giving the orcs dialogue,

291
00:15:25,492 --> 00:15:26,473
another month testing it.

292
00:15:27,734 --> 00:15:28,635
And then it was done.

293
00:15:28,955 --> 00:15:31,517
I had a complete functional.

294
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:35,453
massively, massively flawed whole.

295
00:15:35,813 --> 00:15:37,854
But I had something I could hand to people and say,

296
00:15:37,894 --> 00:15:38,694
this, see this?

297
00:15:38,974 --> 00:15:40,755
This is a game.

298
00:15:50,278 --> 00:15:51,318
It was massively flawed.

299
00:15:51,898 --> 00:15:53,179
It embarrassed me deeply.

300
00:15:53,239 --> 00:15:55,139
But then again, every product I ever write

301
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,700
embarrasses me deeply.

302
00:15:58,547 --> 00:16:02,530
This is one of my guiding phrases when working this business.

303
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:06,813
In the end, you struggle to ship the game,

304
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,154
but at some point, you've got to push the button.

305
00:16:08,174 --> 00:16:10,036
At some point, you've got to kick the thing out the door.

306
00:16:10,396 --> 00:16:13,318
If I double the amount of time working on a game seeking perfection,

307
00:16:13,378 --> 00:16:16,460
I need to double the amount of sales that I get from that game to justify it.

308
00:16:16,821 --> 00:16:18,342
Doubling your sales is hard.

309
00:16:19,262 --> 00:16:21,204
Time is valuable.

310
00:16:21,804 --> 00:16:24,846
I am always striving to be the only thing better than good, which

311
00:16:24,926 --> 00:16:25,787
is good enough.

312
00:16:27,343 --> 00:16:28,324
I get another lucky break.

313
00:16:28,464 --> 00:16:31,565
I'm on Usenet, which is the only discussion forum

314
00:16:31,585 --> 00:16:32,066
on the internet.

315
00:16:32,086 --> 00:16:33,786
At this time, the internet was small enough

316
00:16:33,806 --> 00:16:37,308
that only one insane, anarchic discussion board

317
00:16:37,508 --> 00:16:38,488
covers the whole thing.

318
00:16:38,989 --> 00:16:40,970
The Fandasoft had a hit game called Realms,

319
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,050
and they wanted to get in publishing.

320
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,731
So they offered me a really good deal

321
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:45,211
in order to take my orders for me

322
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:48,113
and give me sort of a basis of a couple thousand people

323
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:49,093
to tell about my game.

324
00:16:49,773 --> 00:16:51,434
They were enormously helpful to me.

325
00:16:51,474 --> 00:16:52,915
I probably would not have a business

326
00:16:52,955 --> 00:16:53,815
if it wasn't for their help.

327
00:16:54,876 --> 00:16:59,857
Third lesson, I strongly recommend whenever possible that you be lucky.

328
00:16:59,877 --> 00:17:02,298
I tend to get in a lot of trouble when I say this.

329
00:17:02,358 --> 00:17:05,999
There are a lot of people who, just to get through the day, they really need to believe

330
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:10,240
that they live in a deterministic world that contains some measure of justice.

331
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:13,581
But that is not the case, especially when you're trying to live in art.

332
00:17:13,641 --> 00:17:15,301
You eventually are going to need a lucky break.

333
00:17:15,321 --> 00:17:17,242
Eventually you're going to need someone to vouch for you.

334
00:17:18,022 --> 00:17:23,863
And all you can do until that time is work your butt off so that when your lucky break

335
00:17:24,023 --> 00:17:24,363
comes.

336
00:17:24,893 --> 00:17:27,635
you are fully ready to jump on it and take advantage of it.

337
00:17:28,835 --> 00:17:29,516
Some starting games.

338
00:17:29,536 --> 00:17:31,877
I have to do all the tedious legal business stuff.

339
00:17:31,897 --> 00:17:33,938
I have to research what it takes to get a business license

340
00:17:34,098 --> 00:17:35,239
and then do that.

341
00:17:35,739 --> 00:17:37,640
Pick a business name, all of that stuff.

342
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,023
So my next bit of advice, have a quality accountant.

343
00:17:43,543 --> 00:17:46,284
And I know you're thinking, this is a professional conference.

344
00:17:46,324 --> 00:17:48,605
Why are you telling me this tedious one-on-one level stuff?

345
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:54,150
because I have lost count of the times when I've talked to a seasoned independent professional

346
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:59,815
who should know better and they're asking me questions and I'm like, dude, you need

347
00:17:59,855 --> 00:18:02,136
an accountant, not me.

348
00:18:02,597 --> 00:18:06,339
Because once you get to the point where you need to pay taxes, where you need to do payroll,

349
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,162
the mistakes are many and they are high impact.

350
00:18:10,502 --> 00:18:12,804
If you screw up your payroll withholding.

351
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:18,635
All that is going to earn you is a tiny little sympathetic shake of the head from your auditor

352
00:18:18,835 --> 00:18:21,177
before he destroys you.

353
00:18:21,197 --> 00:18:28,644
I'm selling a game, so I need to pick a price which is as difficult back then as it is now.

354
00:18:28,984 --> 00:18:32,787
Fortunately, at the time, all successful shareware games were $25, so I picked that.

355
00:18:33,168 --> 00:18:34,349
That is, in today dollars, $41.

356
00:18:34,829 --> 00:18:35,910
Now imagine that.

357
00:18:36,371 --> 00:18:38,893
Imagine actually being able to look people straight in the eyes and charge them $41 for

358
00:18:38,953 --> 00:18:39,153
a game.

359
00:18:40,669 --> 00:18:46,532
But the tragic truth of it is that we are making a bespoke artisanal product for a niche market,

360
00:18:46,552 --> 00:18:47,832
and we should be able to charge this.

361
00:18:47,872 --> 00:18:50,974
It is only the overcrowding that keeps us from being able to charge what we're worth.

362
00:18:51,774 --> 00:18:53,235
But that's the tragedy of the business.

363
00:18:54,356 --> 00:18:56,036
Shareware, so I have to make a demo.

364
00:18:56,157 --> 00:18:59,498
And another tragedy of my business is that I always make my demos too big.

365
00:18:59,758 --> 00:19:00,419
10 hours, 20 hours.

366
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:03,360
I released a game with like a 30-hour demo.

367
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:08,343
I shudder to think of the amount of money that that insanity cost me over the years.

368
00:19:08,966 --> 00:19:11,688
But I've always been weirdly, weirdly proud of it, too.

369
00:19:13,389 --> 00:19:14,430
One thing that helped me sleep at night

370
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:16,371
is that pretty much everyone who got my game, one,

371
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,173
tried it and found it worked on their computer,

372
00:19:18,193 --> 00:19:20,655
two, played it enough to know they enjoy it.

373
00:19:21,055 --> 00:19:22,696
And since we're indie developers and we

374
00:19:22,736 --> 00:19:24,457
like to act like we are subscribed

375
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:27,440
to a higher ethical standard, one of my mottos

376
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,061
has always been, look, if you don't like my game,

377
00:19:29,141 --> 00:19:30,182
I don't want your money.

378
00:19:30,562 --> 00:19:31,723
I'm going to be the only person you're

379
00:19:31,743 --> 00:19:32,844
going to run into in this thing who

380
00:19:32,864 --> 00:19:35,366
think the main problem with the Steam's refund policies

381
00:19:35,386 --> 00:19:36,747
is that they're not generous enough.

382
00:19:37,221 --> 00:19:40,564
I've had a one year no questions asked refund policy forever,

383
00:19:40,824 --> 00:19:41,905
and I've never had problems with it.

384
00:19:41,925 --> 00:19:45,528
Because by and large, the people who pay money for games

385
00:19:45,588 --> 00:19:46,289
are pretty honest.

386
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:49,752
It's done, and I'm out of excuses.

387
00:19:50,433 --> 00:19:51,894
It's time for me to press the button

388
00:19:51,934 --> 00:19:54,516
to upload the demo to America Online

389
00:19:55,137 --> 00:19:58,300
and change my life forever.

390
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,821
And I'm terrified.

391
00:20:00,101 --> 00:20:01,202
I'm completely terrified.

392
00:20:01,262 --> 00:20:02,663
And I'm only able to do it by making

393
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:04,725
what I call a progressive screwdriver.

394
00:20:05,152 --> 00:20:06,713
And here is how you make that.

395
00:20:06,953 --> 00:20:08,393
A screwdriver is an alcoholic beverage.

396
00:20:08,433 --> 00:20:10,194
It is orange juice with vodka added.

397
00:20:10,454 --> 00:20:11,894
If I just made a screwdriver, drank it down,

398
00:20:11,954 --> 00:20:13,434
and then just added more vodka.

399
00:20:15,195 --> 00:20:17,536
When I pressed the upload for my first game,

400
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:20,656
I was wasted.

401
00:20:26,098 --> 00:20:27,338
And God help me, it sold.

402
00:20:27,678 --> 00:20:31,079
We got a little core of people buying the game

403
00:20:31,399 --> 00:20:32,520
because of our publisher.

404
00:20:33,363 --> 00:20:37,764
we because of that attention we got probably the one of the single biggest stroke of luck

405
00:20:37,944 --> 00:20:43,145
a copy of Macworld put us on their shareware CD which was enormously successful and because

406
00:20:43,425 --> 00:20:49,667
our game just it was there weren't many role-playing games and ours was competent we got a lot of word

407
00:20:49,687 --> 00:20:54,028
of mouth and a lot of people say don't count on word of mouth don't count on word of word

408
00:20:54,048 --> 00:20:58,229
of mouth isn't going to get you through and i'm like i've always been reading it like good lord

409
00:20:58,589 --> 00:20:59,850
what else do i have

410
00:21:00,823 --> 00:21:02,124
My games are slow-paced.

411
00:21:02,144 --> 00:21:04,125
They're not good for YouTube and Twitch streaming.

412
00:21:04,325 --> 00:21:04,946
They're cheap.

413
00:21:04,986 --> 00:21:06,887
They're not good for getting press.

414
00:21:07,788 --> 00:21:10,650
We're never going to get a proper publishing deal.

415
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,051
We can't afford advertising.

416
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:14,093
And even if we could, advertising almost never works.

417
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:16,134
Word of mouth is all we ever got.

418
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:18,516
And to be perfectly honest, you need

419
00:21:18,556 --> 00:21:19,797
to write a game that's good enough

420
00:21:19,857 --> 00:21:21,498
that someone's going to be passionate enough about it

421
00:21:21,538 --> 00:21:23,580
to bug their friends and talk on forums about it.

422
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,862
If you don't have that, then you may have a problem.

423
00:21:28,143 --> 00:21:28,503
So anyway.

424
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,020
This is what a game selling looked like in 2017.

425
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,261
Thanks to luck and thanks to Fantasoft's kind help,

426
00:21:35,821 --> 00:21:39,442
we made $53,000 in today dollars in our first year.

427
00:21:39,462 --> 00:21:40,862
And that's solid money.

428
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:41,902
That's a middle class income.

429
00:21:41,942 --> 00:21:43,183
For a grad student, that's amazing.

430
00:21:43,663 --> 00:21:46,583
And so I'm like, OK, this is for real.

431
00:21:47,143 --> 00:21:48,484
And the best thing about it, and I

432
00:21:48,504 --> 00:21:50,344
think one of the great miracles of being

433
00:21:50,364 --> 00:21:53,425
an indie creator in any field, is that I owned my work.

434
00:21:54,145 --> 00:21:56,126
When you make a video game, you've made a miracle.

435
00:21:56,146 --> 00:21:57,987
You've made a machine that prints money.

436
00:21:58,227 --> 00:21:59,648
Normally when you make a machine that prints money,

437
00:21:59,688 --> 00:22:01,089
it's a felony and they send you to jail,

438
00:22:01,109 --> 00:22:02,870
but here they let you get away with it.

439
00:22:03,351 --> 00:22:05,792
And even if that machine isn't making money right now,

440
00:22:05,872 --> 00:22:07,233
you wait five years, you remaster it,

441
00:22:07,253 --> 00:22:08,954
it might start, put some more ink in it,

442
00:22:08,974 --> 00:22:10,435
it might start kicking out money then.

443
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:13,377
There has not hardly been a day gone by

444
00:22:13,477 --> 00:22:16,339
since I released Exile that I have not made money off of it.

445
00:22:16,979 --> 00:22:19,181
And owning your work is one of the greatest things

446
00:22:19,221 --> 00:22:19,581
in the world.

447
00:22:20,507 --> 00:22:22,668
And even back then I knew if I wanted to try to make a go of it,

448
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,650
my whole story was going to be about two things,

449
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:27,712
making a back catalog and getting myself some fans.

450
00:22:34,617 --> 00:22:38,299
So at this point, my grad school performance is pretty much non-existent.

451
00:22:38,379 --> 00:22:40,101
So I take a master's and I get the heck out.

452
00:22:41,221 --> 00:22:44,524
I port Exile to Windows, writing games on Windows 3.1.

453
00:22:44,564 --> 00:22:46,605
The less said about that, the better.

454
00:22:47,206 --> 00:22:51,389
It took me three days to draw one 256 color icon onto a screen.

455
00:22:51,409 --> 00:22:53,311
I put that demo on America Online.

456
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:54,251
That sells, too.

457
00:22:54,792 --> 00:22:55,052
Great.

458
00:22:55,172 --> 00:22:56,293
So now I need to write another game.

459
00:22:56,473 --> 00:22:57,234
What am I going to do?

460
00:22:57,794 --> 00:22:58,975
Well, it's the computer game industry.

461
00:22:58,995 --> 00:23:02,057
I take the name of a previous game and I put a two after it.

462
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:09,723
About this time, now everyone in this business is familiar with the phenomenon where your

463
00:23:09,743 --> 00:23:11,905
game sells great and then the sales suddenly drop by 90%.

464
00:23:13,296 --> 00:23:16,618
These days, in this unlightened, accelerated time, that usually takes about three days.

465
00:23:16,678 --> 00:23:18,019
Back then it took me a few months.

466
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:23,404
But not long after I decided to go full-time, my cells just immediately fall into the toilet

467
00:23:23,504 --> 00:23:25,205
and I felt like I was going to die.

468
00:23:26,006 --> 00:23:31,910
I took that limitless terror and funneled that energy into working on Exile 2 harder.

469
00:23:33,031 --> 00:23:37,775
Now at this point, now I'm making a new game, all of a sudden the pattern for how I like

470
00:23:37,795 --> 00:23:39,457
to do things starts to be clearer.

471
00:23:40,098 --> 00:23:42,459
I tend to, I like a small company, I like to work alone.

472
00:23:42,739 --> 00:23:44,020
I keep doing that.

473
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,801
Most of my code is functional, so I keep reusing it.

474
00:23:47,221 --> 00:23:50,582
I reuse most of my assets, most of my graphics, most of my sounds.

475
00:23:50,883 --> 00:23:53,323
I am merciless about reusing assets.

476
00:23:53,444 --> 00:23:56,645
I have used the same wolf icon in like 15 different games.

477
00:23:57,085 --> 00:23:58,646
If it's a decent icon, it looks like a wolf.

478
00:23:58,746 --> 00:24:00,406
The next game, it's still going to look like a wolf.

479
00:24:00,826 --> 00:24:05,988
People make fun of me for it all the time, but I am also still in business.

480
00:24:09,176 --> 00:24:13,242
release a new game, I look for the 25% of it that's the worst and I redo that.

481
00:24:13,682 --> 00:24:17,407
I am the leanest and the meanest of developers.

482
00:24:17,908 --> 00:24:20,932
And again, this is all part of finding my creative process.

483
00:24:20,972 --> 00:24:24,336
People make fun of me for it all the time, but it's still, it's just the way I work.

484
00:24:24,637 --> 00:24:25,518
And if you're not like that...

485
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:28,951
If you are, if you need bespoke art,

486
00:24:29,031 --> 00:24:30,332
and if you need custom music,

487
00:24:30,692 --> 00:24:33,593
if that's your process, then go with it.

488
00:24:33,633 --> 00:24:35,374
You know, you have to earn more sales to make up for it,

489
00:24:35,394 --> 00:24:36,395
but if that's what you need to do

490
00:24:36,435 --> 00:24:38,476
to feel happy with your life in this business,

491
00:24:38,496 --> 00:24:39,196
that's what you gotta do.

492
00:24:39,456 --> 00:24:41,157
But if you feel, find a thing where you feel

493
00:24:41,177 --> 00:24:42,298
that it's okay to be cheap,

494
00:24:42,978 --> 00:24:45,639
do not let anyone shame you out of being cheap.

495
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,842
Finish Exile 2, it takes a little over a year.

496
00:24:50,382 --> 00:24:52,363
It's like Exile, but a tiny bit better.

497
00:24:58,383 --> 00:24:59,183
So it's still selling.

498
00:24:59,203 --> 00:25:00,844
I have to write a new game.

499
00:25:01,065 --> 00:25:02,585
Well, my last game had a 2 after the name,

500
00:25:02,625 --> 00:25:04,387
so I decided, you know, it's the video game industry,

501
00:25:04,487 --> 00:25:05,267
I changed the 2 to a 3.

502
00:25:07,448 --> 00:25:09,390
Now, by this time, I have pretty much entirely

503
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:13,272
strip-mined my childhood of good ideas,

504
00:25:13,372 --> 00:25:15,533
so I evolve my design process.

505
00:25:15,834 --> 00:25:17,555
Instead of just stealing ideas from the games

506
00:25:17,575 --> 00:25:19,076
from when I was young, I look at the games

507
00:25:19,096 --> 00:25:20,416
that came out in the previous three years,

508
00:25:20,697 --> 00:25:23,378
and I steal the best single idea from every one of those.

509
00:25:25,699 --> 00:25:29,262
Again, innovation is great, and it is one of the greatest strengths of being an indie.

510
00:25:29,482 --> 00:25:32,665
But another of the greatest strengths of being an indie is that we have the ability to pick

511
00:25:32,745 --> 00:25:38,489
up the genres that are too small for AAA people to take advantage of—puzzle games, roguelikes,

512
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:40,351
adventure games—and exploit those.

513
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:44,394
And because there are so many games, there aren't that many underutilized genres.

514
00:25:44,414 --> 00:25:48,277
But a new genre re-becomes underutilized every year.

515
00:25:49,779 --> 00:25:50,539
It's 1997.

516
00:25:50,699 --> 00:25:51,760
The web exists.

517
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,963
I code this utterly gorgeous website.

518
00:25:56,202 --> 00:25:58,204
It's on spiderwebsoftware.com still.

519
00:25:58,324 --> 00:26:01,787
It's not on spiderweb.com because someone has been squatting on that URL

520
00:26:01,847 --> 00:26:03,788
for the last 25 continuous years.

521
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:09,012
We decide to go independent.

522
00:26:09,032 --> 00:26:11,614
We break from Phantosoft and we start doing everything ourselves.

523
00:26:11,754 --> 00:26:14,636
To do this convincingly, I have to gain the ability to take credit cards.

524
00:26:15,016 --> 00:26:17,398
Now at this time, no bank will trust me

525
00:26:17,458 --> 00:26:19,940
because nobody seriously believes it is possible

526
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,422
to make money on the Internet.

527
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:26,372
They think I'm going to collect a bunch of credit cards and then fly off to Honduras or whatever.

528
00:26:26,912 --> 00:26:30,293
So I beg bank after bank after bank, look, I'm a real business.

529
00:26:30,373 --> 00:26:31,373
I'm making real money.

530
00:26:31,393 --> 00:26:32,734
I need to be able to take credit cards.

531
00:26:33,154 --> 00:26:40,336
And finally, one bank, to prove that I'm not a con artist, they ask me for a printout of my website.

532
00:26:42,237 --> 00:26:43,417
So I print out my website.

533
00:26:44,317 --> 00:26:45,158
I hand it to them.

534
00:26:45,518 --> 00:26:47,158
They look at me like I'm a wizard.

535
00:26:48,678 --> 00:26:52,520
And then they sent me a credit card swipe machine to go in my apartment.

536
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:55,661
So to order people call me on the phone and I typed the number in with my finger.

537
00:26:56,521 --> 00:26:58,202
We program our own online store.

538
00:26:58,282 --> 00:26:59,383
We host our own demos.

539
00:26:59,423 --> 00:27:02,064
We handle our own file file handling.

540
00:27:02,084 --> 00:27:03,545
We do all our own security.

541
00:27:04,085 --> 00:27:12,789
We do all of the own horrible stuff that services like iTunes and Steam make frictionless.

542
00:27:12,989 --> 00:27:17,211
And, you know, I just have to say sometimes take a moment to appreciate how.

543
00:27:18,013 --> 00:27:23,477
how amazing everything is. Like I hear Indies complain all the time about the cut that Apple

544
00:27:23,617 --> 00:27:29,221
and Steam take. But all of the stuff that Steam does for you and makes easy, I've had

545
00:27:29,261 --> 00:27:36,006
to do myself, support myself, all a part. I've hired full-time employees to do the stuff

546
00:27:36,046 --> 00:27:42,610
that Steam does. I know how much it costs. And more importantly, they do too. So if you

547
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:43,791
want to be mad at Steam...

548
00:27:45,062 --> 00:27:48,383
Fine, but bear in mind that that percentage is not going to shift.

549
00:27:50,243 --> 00:27:51,204
We finish Exile 3.

550
00:27:51,744 --> 00:27:52,524
It's big.

551
00:27:52,644 --> 00:27:55,144
It actually contains some innovation in addition to the theft.

552
00:27:55,845 --> 00:27:57,145
There's still not a lot of role-playing games out.

553
00:27:57,185 --> 00:27:59,985
It's exactly the right game at the right time, and it's a big hit.

554
00:28:00,966 --> 00:28:03,446
Now, I say that I had a shareware hit.

555
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:05,307
Now, these days when you have a hit,

556
00:28:05,347 --> 00:28:08,307
that means that you get to build a mansion out of yachts.

557
00:28:09,167 --> 00:28:10,888
In 1997, having a hit was something less different.

558
00:28:14,554 --> 00:28:18,836
My first year of sales from Exile 3 was, in today dollars, $330,000.

559
00:28:19,417 --> 00:28:21,838
And that's, don't get me wrong, that's serious money.

560
00:28:21,878 --> 00:28:23,239
That's life-changing money.

561
00:28:23,479 --> 00:28:25,120
That's, you sell, having a game that sells like that,

562
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,242
you're going to be eating out on that game for the rest of your life.

563
00:28:27,282 --> 00:28:30,003
That's, I'm going to be in this business for a long time money.

564
00:28:31,004 --> 00:28:34,286
But it's not, it's still, I have to work for a living money.

565
00:28:34,506 --> 00:28:39,209
And by the way, before I, before I leave this slide, I want to, I beg you,

566
00:28:39,689 --> 00:28:42,411
please, please support bigcatclipart.com.

567
00:28:44,321 --> 00:28:45,522
And the good work they do.

568
00:28:49,543 --> 00:28:52,284
My radiant wife, Mary Ann, who is the wind beneath my wings,

569
00:28:52,344 --> 00:28:53,865
has a job that she hates.

570
00:28:54,105 --> 00:28:56,286
So she quits her job and comes on board with me.

571
00:28:56,346 --> 00:28:57,867
And since then, we've been writing

572
00:28:57,887 --> 00:28:58,827
spiderweb software together.

573
00:28:58,867 --> 00:29:01,548
She is my business manager and keeps

574
00:29:01,688 --> 00:29:02,649
every single thing running.

575
00:29:03,589 --> 00:29:05,890
At this point, we're doing all our own everything ourselves.

576
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:07,971
Most of our orders come in over the phone,

577
00:29:07,991 --> 00:29:09,772
and we talk to humans.

578
00:29:11,287 --> 00:29:17,711
People talk a lot about how on the internet, the anonymity makes it easier for people to be mean to each other.

579
00:29:17,891 --> 00:29:26,217
But anyone who has done phone customer service, I assure you, people have no problem being utterly inhuman to you when they're talking to you like a person.

580
00:29:28,438 --> 00:29:34,962
This is a key lesson for anyone who runs a small business or deals in a creative way.

581
00:29:36,163 --> 00:29:38,905
It is a human constant that a certain number of people...

582
00:29:39,267 --> 00:29:43,590
Let's say 10% no matter what the demographic,

583
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:44,870
if you're talking about people who are left-handed,

584
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:46,952
people with red hair, people who are gamers,

585
00:29:46,992 --> 00:29:48,132
people who wear mismatched socks,

586
00:29:48,372 --> 00:29:49,353
a certain percentage of those people

587
00:29:49,393 --> 00:29:50,614
are always gonna be mean.

588
00:29:50,634 --> 00:29:52,575
A certain percentage of those people

589
00:29:52,595 --> 00:29:53,796
are always gonna be cranks,

590
00:29:53,876 --> 00:29:55,537
and there's nothing you can do about it.

591
00:29:56,097 --> 00:29:58,478
And when you're building your business world

592
00:29:58,598 --> 00:30:00,559
and your mind environment,

593
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,120
you have to take that into account.

594
00:30:02,403 --> 00:30:05,905
And you should remember that often the people who are angriest at you are not going to be

595
00:30:06,185 --> 00:30:06,886
completely anonymous.

596
00:30:06,906 --> 00:30:10,768
They're going to be the people who five years ago were your most devout fans.

597
00:30:11,108 --> 00:30:14,871
And then you changed a thing, and it was their favorite thing, and they don't like you anymore.

598
00:30:15,211 --> 00:30:18,733
Just remember, there is always a very thin line between love and hate.

599
00:30:19,594 --> 00:30:24,337
And so if you're going to make it for your 40 years, shelter your brain.

600
00:30:25,117 --> 00:30:29,480
If there is a sort of input that puts me off my feet and slows down my work, I have to

601
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,000
be working at—

602
00:30:30,624 --> 00:30:32,665
top efficiency to keep this ball rolling.

603
00:30:33,146 --> 00:30:36,427
If something is keeping me from working, I cut it out mercilessly.

604
00:30:36,727 --> 00:30:38,408
I have no idea what my Steam reviews are.

605
00:30:39,149 --> 00:30:39,449
None!

606
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:43,131
I never go on my forums unless I absolutely have to.

607
00:30:43,191 --> 00:30:45,292
If a new game is out, I have to look on it to see if there's any bugs.

608
00:30:45,352 --> 00:30:46,113
I look at my forums.

609
00:30:46,253 --> 00:30:47,553
Otherwise, I never look at forums.

610
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:50,775
I'm on Twitter, but if people start being mean to me on Twitter, I quit.

611
00:30:51,367 --> 00:30:53,267
And I go on, go back on when the coast is clear.

612
00:30:53,607 --> 00:30:55,168
And let me be clear.

613
00:30:55,688 --> 00:30:58,909
You know, I'm a white guy, so I get less abuse.

614
00:30:59,249 --> 00:31:00,430
I'll be straightforward about that.

615
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:01,750
Bear in mind, I still get abuse.

616
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:04,651
I have gotten some input from out in the wild that

617
00:31:04,691 --> 00:31:06,992
has utterly and legitimately terrified me.

618
00:31:07,993 --> 00:31:10,674
But other people will get more abuse

619
00:31:10,714 --> 00:31:12,694
than I am because of who they are.

620
00:31:13,595 --> 00:31:14,535
It is not fair.

621
00:31:14,895 --> 00:31:16,836
It is one of many unfair things that you

622
00:31:16,876 --> 00:31:18,116
are going to run into in this business.

623
00:31:18,436 --> 00:31:20,337
But no matter what happens, once again.

624
00:31:20,692 --> 00:31:22,493
There's going to be cranks and you can't do anything.

625
00:31:22,553 --> 00:31:24,733
So you have to shelter your brain because in the end,

626
00:31:24,773 --> 00:31:28,754
the first order of business is your work and producing it.

627
00:31:29,874 --> 00:31:32,375
And one more side note, don't be afraid to fire a customer.

628
00:31:32,715 --> 00:31:35,595
They say that the customer is always right.

629
00:31:35,715 --> 00:31:36,196
That's not true.

630
00:31:36,236 --> 00:31:37,776
Customers are wrong all the time.

631
00:31:38,076 --> 00:31:41,237
But the truth is nobody ever won an argument with a customer.

632
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:43,497
There are times when you're going to have to say to someone, look.

633
00:31:44,732 --> 00:31:48,253
My thing isn't for you. I can't add that feature. I can't write that expansion.

634
00:31:48,713 --> 00:31:50,214
I just can't do the thing you want.

635
00:31:50,234 --> 00:31:52,175
Offer them a refund and send them on their way.

636
00:31:52,555 --> 00:31:56,057
If someone is on the forums and you can see that they're just there to cause trouble,

637
00:31:56,617 --> 00:31:57,297
ban them.

638
00:31:58,578 --> 00:31:59,699
If people are making a noise,

639
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:02,040
that person who is screwing up your business, you shouldn't have banned them.

640
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,380
Ban them too.

641
00:32:06,362 --> 00:32:09,623
The beatings will continue until morale improves.

642
00:32:10,263 --> 00:32:11,264
Daddy is home.

643
00:32:16,521 --> 00:32:20,744
If you're on the floor, if you're on your forums and someone is just there to make trouble,

644
00:32:20,944 --> 00:32:23,885
you can tell, and some of them are good about it, they'll just push right up to the line

645
00:32:23,926 --> 00:32:26,207
and push back, push right up to the line and push back.

646
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:32,671
People who are nice and who support you will understand.

647
00:32:34,045 --> 00:32:37,247
About this time, I also start trying to help other shareware people do what I do.

648
00:32:37,327 --> 00:32:40,729
I create this website, which is still up, is hilariously out of date.

649
00:32:40,749 --> 00:32:41,549
It's like 20 years old.

650
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:45,732
But I've always written talks, written, given talks, written articles,

651
00:32:45,752 --> 00:32:49,494
done everything I could to help shareware developers because I believe in it.

652
00:32:50,015 --> 00:32:50,455
I really do.

653
00:32:54,257 --> 00:32:57,720
So in a very short period of time, we go from not believing it is possible

654
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:01,122
to make money on the internet to believing you can only make money

655
00:33:01,202 --> 00:33:01,682
on the internet.

656
00:33:04,417 --> 00:33:10,478
And even at the time, people, it was fully obvious that this was ridiculous.

657
00:33:10,879 --> 00:33:13,059
Basically, people would just make tech companies.

658
00:33:13,099 --> 00:33:14,699
They'd try to grow it really, really fast.

659
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,720
Even though the company was obviously doomed,

660
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:19,760
they'd try to get enough interest in it to get in a whole bunch of IPO and investor money,

661
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:23,001
cash out, move to a different continent, and then the whole thing exploded,

662
00:33:23,361 --> 00:33:25,001
which, of course, it did, as it had to.

663
00:33:25,381 --> 00:33:28,482
Fortunately, we live in a much more enlightened time now,

664
00:33:28,822 --> 00:33:30,882
and we can be assured that that will never happen again.

665
00:33:33,504 --> 00:33:34,485
The bubble was a big help for us.

666
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:37,066
Everyone and their cousin was making a video game website

667
00:33:37,126 --> 00:33:38,947
because they thought there was money in that.

668
00:33:39,447 --> 00:33:41,428
And we had a lot of free PR from it.

669
00:33:41,468 --> 00:33:43,129
They sent out shareware CDs.

670
00:33:43,189 --> 00:33:44,389
We got a lot of them.

671
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:48,231
Between having a successful game and sort of splash onto us

672
00:33:48,251 --> 00:33:51,392
from the internet boom, we had to ask ourselves, now what?

673
00:33:51,532 --> 00:33:52,313
What's our business going to do?

674
00:33:52,333 --> 00:33:52,913
What's it going to be like?

675
00:33:52,953 --> 00:33:53,994
Because we could get investors.

676
00:33:54,034 --> 00:33:55,374
We could build a real business.

677
00:33:55,474 --> 00:33:58,996
I could make games that my parents aren't ashamed of.

678
00:33:59,536 --> 00:34:00,296
What am I going to do?

679
00:34:02,065 --> 00:34:03,205
we could build something really big.

680
00:34:03,605 --> 00:34:05,366
We thought about it, we had some conversations,

681
00:34:05,426 --> 00:34:06,987
and we basically did nothing.

682
00:34:08,107 --> 00:34:10,028
We had one full-time employee to do for us

683
00:34:10,088 --> 00:34:11,749
all the stuff that Steam does for us now

684
00:34:11,769 --> 00:34:13,829
so that we could go to Disney World sometimes.

685
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:15,390
That's pretty much all we changed.

686
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:19,492
And just to be clear, we have no regrets.

687
00:34:19,572 --> 00:34:21,572
And if you wanna build a big, real company,

688
00:34:22,213 --> 00:34:25,174
if you wanna be a Viking, my God, go for it.

689
00:34:25,194 --> 00:34:26,574
You have nothing but my admiration.

690
00:34:26,614 --> 00:34:28,335
If that's the way you need to be

691
00:34:28,375 --> 00:34:30,276
to live in this business, do that.

692
00:34:30,748 --> 00:34:33,150
But me, I'm a humble toy maker.

693
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:38,553
I sit in my garage and I make little toys for all the happy boys and girls.

694
00:34:39,114 --> 00:34:39,814
That's my life.

695
00:34:41,936 --> 00:34:44,698
That is what I do, that is what I'm always going to do.

696
00:34:44,818 --> 00:34:47,680
Live or die, that's my bag.

697
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,621
And just one more fun aside.

698
00:34:50,582 --> 00:34:55,946
There were so many games magazines that for a short time it was very, very good money

699
00:34:56,006 --> 00:34:56,907
to write about video games.

700
00:34:57,444 --> 00:35:01,506
I had days where it's like, oh, God, I want to work on this game, but I have to write

701
00:35:01,586 --> 00:35:04,006
game criticism because it makes so much money.

702
00:35:04,026 --> 00:35:10,569
Oh, it feels good to laugh.

703
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:14,450
Of course, that ended.

704
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:18,031
And yet, someday, someday it may return.

705
00:35:18,312 --> 00:35:21,573
When enough people go out of — when enough people in a field go out of business.

706
00:35:22,234 --> 00:35:24,315
And the demand, for some reason, increases.

707
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:26,717
You get a growth period in the business cycle.

708
00:35:26,777 --> 00:35:29,338
You just have to be lucky enough and ready enough

709
00:35:29,438 --> 00:35:30,299
to catch it when it comes.

710
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,901
So over the next four years, we write more games.

711
00:35:34,262 --> 00:35:36,003
We write Blades of Exile, which is Exile,

712
00:35:36,023 --> 00:35:38,825
but with this really dumb, obvious scenario creation

713
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,886
system that's simple enough that anybody can use it.

714
00:35:41,186 --> 00:35:43,568
And we get piles and piles of scenarios for it.

715
00:35:43,728 --> 00:35:44,609
It's still popular.

716
00:35:44,669 --> 00:35:45,389
We open sourced it.

717
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:47,611
I decided to write a new IP.

718
00:35:47,751 --> 00:35:49,012
I write a game called Nethergate,

719
00:35:49,032 --> 00:35:50,913
which is something almost like innovation.

720
00:35:50,953 --> 00:35:51,653
It's historical.

721
00:35:52,228 --> 00:35:58,610
role-playing game with Celts versus Romans in ancient Britain. I read actual books. So

722
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:02,171
this is what it looks like. I switched my graphics around. I'm trying to get a little

723
00:36:02,191 --> 00:36:07,533
bit more productive values. It had a really innovative story structure where it's one

724
00:36:07,553 --> 00:36:10,934
story but you can play two different sides and see it from both sides. Kind of seemed

725
00:36:10,974 --> 00:36:16,475
like an educational game, which is death. But it sold okay. And I was getting really

726
00:36:16,515 --> 00:36:18,336
sick of this point of everyone telling me

727
00:36:18,702 --> 00:36:21,122
your graphics suck, your graphics suck, your graphics suck.

728
00:36:21,142 --> 00:36:24,983
So I spent some actual money, I hired actual artists, and got graphics that were somewhere

729
00:36:25,023 --> 00:36:27,904
in the same continent as the standard for graphics at the time.

730
00:36:28,284 --> 00:36:32,305
The result, of course, was that every day people told me your graphics suck, your graphics

731
00:36:32,365 --> 00:36:33,246
suck, your graphics suck.

732
00:36:33,686 --> 00:36:36,607
That was the last time I ever made the mistake of making an effort.

733
00:36:40,508 --> 00:36:42,768
It's really important to note in indie games that...

734
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:45,548
pretty much every game is going to be someone's favorite game.

735
00:36:45,788 --> 00:36:48,110
Your goal is to make a game that is enough people's favorite game

736
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:50,511
to keep you in food and shelter.

737
00:36:50,931 --> 00:36:54,273
And this is why you should always be very scared of someone

738
00:36:54,453 --> 00:36:57,195
asking for more curation on a platform.

739
00:36:57,575 --> 00:37:00,157
Because one person or one panel of people

740
00:37:00,217 --> 00:37:03,199
can never, ever predict in the end what

741
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:04,480
the market is going to like.

742
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:08,222
The only thing that can decide what the market will like

743
00:37:08,662 --> 00:37:09,363
is the market.

744
00:37:12,094 --> 00:37:13,355
We'd been in this for a few years.

745
00:37:13,855 --> 00:37:15,136
Our games were selling consistently.

746
00:37:15,196 --> 00:37:16,456
We had a real fan base.

747
00:37:16,636 --> 00:37:18,797
Role-playing games are an evergreen niche,

748
00:37:18,817 --> 00:37:19,698
and we served it well.

749
00:37:20,078 --> 00:37:21,819
Everything seemed to be just cruising along fine.

750
00:37:22,099 --> 00:37:23,600
So that's when we almost went out of business.

751
00:37:27,261 --> 00:37:27,862
Suspense.

752
00:37:29,883 --> 00:37:31,483
Our next series was the Geneforge series,

753
00:37:31,503 --> 00:37:33,745
which I'm enormously proud of and is

754
00:37:34,405 --> 00:37:37,226
next in line for a really nice remastering.

755
00:37:37,586 --> 00:37:39,227
The Geneforge games were actually innovative.

756
00:37:40,037 --> 00:37:42,757
It was a sci-fi fantasy hybrid.

757
00:37:43,677 --> 00:37:45,057
There's no bad guys in GeneForge,

758
00:37:45,077 --> 00:37:46,958
there's just factions that you choose between.

759
00:37:47,038 --> 00:37:48,278
The gameplay is very open-ended.

760
00:37:48,318 --> 00:37:50,378
You can play an entirely pacifist character,

761
00:37:50,638 --> 00:37:52,059
get through the whole thing with trickery

762
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:53,279
and never do a fight.

763
00:37:54,019 --> 00:37:57,060
At this point, the Exile games are embarrassingly old,

764
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:00,020
so we start remastering them as Avernum games,

765
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,000
and once again, those sell great.

766
00:38:03,041 --> 00:38:05,441
We hum along for another six years.

767
00:38:05,481 --> 00:38:08,141
We do two GeneForge games, we do two remasters,

768
00:38:08,181 --> 00:38:08,702
we have fans.

769
00:38:09,023 --> 00:38:11,505
Every year in November, we do a sale 10% off.

770
00:38:11,745 --> 00:38:12,686
Can you imagine?

771
00:38:13,006 --> 00:38:13,967
That always does really well.

772
00:38:15,308 --> 00:38:18,131
Around this time, we're making in the 200,000s a year

773
00:38:18,531 --> 00:38:19,912
for three full-time employees.

774
00:38:20,252 --> 00:38:22,194
And most of the time, that's around what we make.

775
00:38:22,394 --> 00:38:24,256
And that was pretty solid.

776
00:38:25,317 --> 00:38:28,600
So 2007, we've been doing this for about 13 years.

777
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,962
I remastered Blades of Exile as Blades of Vernum.

778
00:38:30,982 --> 00:38:32,983
It has a really powerful scripting engine people

779
00:38:33,023 --> 00:38:34,545
can use to make scenarios.

780
00:38:34,725 --> 00:38:37,167
It takes forever to write it, and it's just too complicated.

781
00:38:37,207 --> 00:38:37,427
People.

782
00:38:38,122 --> 00:38:40,382
weren't really as into making adventures with it.

783
00:38:41,303 --> 00:38:43,804
I write Gene Forge 3, and quite frankly, I was lazy.

784
00:38:44,184 --> 00:38:45,504
I had been a long time as complacent.

785
00:38:45,564 --> 00:38:47,545
I slacked off, and I made a game that was just too similar

786
00:38:47,605 --> 00:38:48,745
to the two previous games.

787
00:38:50,006 --> 00:38:50,866
They just didn't do that well.

788
00:38:51,386 --> 00:38:52,307
They went down a bunch.

789
00:38:52,387 --> 00:38:54,507
And I'll just show you numbers to show what, for us,

790
00:38:54,588 --> 00:38:55,808
almost going out of business means.

791
00:38:56,328 --> 00:38:59,149
2003, we make almost $300,000 in today dollars.

792
00:38:59,429 --> 00:39:02,310
The next year, it's down by over a quarter.

793
00:39:02,948 --> 00:39:04,668
And again, three full-time employees.

794
00:39:04,848 --> 00:39:07,409
We have a ton of expenses doing the things

795
00:39:07,449 --> 00:39:08,489
that Steam does for us.

796
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,910
And on top of that, we got two kids.

797
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:12,611
And you know the joke, how much money

798
00:39:12,651 --> 00:39:13,751
does it take to raise kids?

799
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:14,631
All of it.

800
00:39:15,472 --> 00:39:17,852
So this seems like a pretty healthy number.

801
00:39:18,012 --> 00:39:19,313
But this means we're bouncing checks.

802
00:39:19,533 --> 00:39:21,393
At this point, we're kind of running scared.

803
00:39:22,294 --> 00:39:25,094
And so at this point, I wise up and try

804
00:39:25,134 --> 00:39:27,215
to get over my complacency.

805
00:39:27,255 --> 00:39:29,756
I start redoing, redouble my energy

806
00:39:29,816 --> 00:39:31,176
and start redoing everything I can.

807
00:39:32,116 --> 00:39:32,537
And once again.

808
00:39:33,017 --> 00:39:36,038
Here's some advice that seems like sort of artsy,

809
00:39:36,498 --> 00:39:39,138
oh yeah, you always have to keep growing as a human man.

810
00:39:39,499 --> 00:39:41,039
Have you ever looked at your hands?

811
00:39:41,499 --> 00:39:41,719
No.

812
00:39:43,659 --> 00:39:45,120
You have to keep growing as an artist.

813
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,860
And this is hard-nosed practical advice.

814
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,401
Because remember, for the most part, we're toy makers.

815
00:39:49,861 --> 00:39:51,301
We sell amusements.

816
00:39:51,781 --> 00:39:53,982
We sell things that tickle people's brains.

817
00:39:54,062 --> 00:39:55,082
We sell surprise.

818
00:39:55,482 --> 00:39:58,303
And complacency and predictability and repetition

819
00:39:58,403 --> 00:39:59,503
are the death of that.

820
00:39:59,955 --> 00:40:02,618
If you want to write a sequel great sequels are awesome,

821
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:04,780
but your sequel better introduce something new

822
00:40:05,121 --> 00:40:07,223
and it better introduce that new thing early

823
00:40:07,243 --> 00:40:09,065
because if people put up your game ago,

824
00:40:09,345 --> 00:40:11,628
yeah, I've done all this and I don't need to do more of this

825
00:40:12,128 --> 00:40:13,971
then you're going to start bouncing checks.

826
00:40:15,592 --> 00:40:17,915
We extend the Exile series into a vernum 4 5

827
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:21,018
and 6 with a completely revamped engine that does really well.

828
00:40:21,941 --> 00:40:24,622
We redo a lot of stuff about how we do GeneForge 4.

829
00:40:24,742 --> 00:40:26,463
I expand the scripting engine and create

830
00:40:26,563 --> 00:40:28,604
really complicated multi-stage events

831
00:40:28,904 --> 00:40:31,025
and introduce them as soon as the game starts.

832
00:40:31,085 --> 00:40:32,946
The next two GeneForge games sell really well.

833
00:40:34,526 --> 00:40:37,407
And then the most surprising thing

834
00:40:37,427 --> 00:40:39,688
I could have possibly imagined happened.

835
00:40:40,469 --> 00:40:41,849
Indie games became big.

836
00:40:49,174 --> 00:40:52,115
Indie bubble is not really the correct term.

837
00:40:52,275 --> 00:40:54,115
It was not really a true speculative bubble.

838
00:40:54,435 --> 00:40:56,116
I should call it the indie glut.

839
00:40:56,836 --> 00:41:00,016
But I'm not going to go much into the factors that caused it.

840
00:41:00,037 --> 00:41:01,217
It's been much discussed.

841
00:41:01,357 --> 00:41:04,277
I will only add one factor about why indie games got big that I

842
00:41:04,297 --> 00:41:05,318
don't think gets enough attention.

843
00:41:06,178 --> 00:41:09,079
Indie games are successful because people like us.

844
00:41:09,879 --> 00:41:11,159
We're the little guy.

845
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:14,540
We're the scrappy tinkerers in our garages fighting

846
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,080
against the big monolithic corporations.

847
00:41:17,437 --> 00:41:22,160
This is an enormously powerful and moving archetype.

848
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,142
Whole teen movies are made about this.

849
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:30,046
And it is important to remember that we are likable,

850
00:41:30,146 --> 00:41:32,308
and it's important to concentrate on staying likable,

851
00:41:32,368 --> 00:41:35,070
because that likability is one of our greatest assets.

852
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:39,173
If you're likable, that is what will make people stick with you

853
00:41:39,193 --> 00:41:40,534
through rough times, and that is what

854
00:41:41,755 --> 00:41:43,196
make people go to your Kickstarter and spend $1,000

855
00:41:43,236 --> 00:41:43,616
for a $15 game.

856
00:41:47,818 --> 00:41:49,139
Steam's big, indie games are big.

857
00:41:49,419 --> 00:41:51,980
I write a whole new game engine and a whole new game,

858
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,502
which looks a little bit prettier, called Avidan.

859
00:41:55,803 --> 00:41:58,304
And between having a nice-looking new game

860
00:41:58,344 --> 00:41:59,965
and back catalog, we're able to make a lot of money.

861
00:42:00,606 --> 00:42:03,467
And I have to return again to the idea of luck.

862
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:09,051
Now, at this point, I've been making indie games for decades.

863
00:42:10,292 --> 00:42:11,572
And I was sort of humming along.

864
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:13,333
But all of a sudden, indie games became big

865
00:42:13,353 --> 00:42:15,074
when nobody was expecting it.

866
00:42:15,255 --> 00:42:17,036
There was a huge demand for product.

867
00:42:17,116 --> 00:42:17,456
And hey.

868
00:42:17,845 --> 00:42:20,186
I was sitting on years and years and years of back catalog.

869
00:42:20,466 --> 00:42:25,107
And as a result of that, I was able to get more deals and make more money than I in any

870
00:42:25,187 --> 00:42:26,528
remote way deserved.

871
00:42:28,268 --> 00:42:30,309
We got on all the fashionable online stores.

872
00:42:30,349 --> 00:42:31,669
We lucked into a meeting with Steam.

873
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:36,131
And I'm sure a lot of people ask, Jeff Vogel, why did he get that detail?

874
00:42:36,151 --> 00:42:37,872
Why is he in that place?

875
00:42:37,892 --> 00:42:42,073
Well, one of the things is I always try to be the most frictionless person to work with.

876
00:42:42,613 --> 00:42:45,074
I'll negotiate about contracts, but not very much.

877
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:49,703
I'm not a hard ass. I answer emails right away. I pay contractors right away.

878
00:42:49,943 --> 00:42:52,905
So when asked for assets, they have them in their hands by the end of the day.

879
00:42:53,225 --> 00:42:58,529
If you're as frictionless as possible to work with, you will be amazed at what opportunities it opens for you.

880
00:43:00,051 --> 00:43:03,873
We lower our games to $10 because Steam tells us that's what we have to do to be on Steam.

881
00:43:04,274 --> 00:43:07,016
We do so and God knows we made it up in volume.

882
00:43:07,856 --> 00:43:11,519
And at the beginning of the IndieGlitch, this is how much money we made.

883
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:13,881
It is, again, this is

884
00:43:14,594 --> 00:43:21,756
life-changing money. It's just the culmination of a very lucky break, followed by a lot of

885
00:43:21,816 --> 00:43:28,638
work, and it's more than we deserve. The indie glut starts to rise. People see that indie

886
00:43:28,658 --> 00:43:31,939
games are big and they start writing them. We do our standard thing. We write two more

887
00:43:31,999 --> 00:43:35,941
new games. We write two more remasters. We make them as good as we could. We sell a ton.

888
00:43:36,401 --> 00:43:38,582
And then as more indie games flow in, we sell a lot less.

889
00:43:40,505 --> 00:43:43,026
Massive competition means we can't make up in volume anymore.

890
00:43:43,086 --> 00:43:45,547
We raise our prices to $20, which is where we are now.

891
00:43:46,347 --> 00:43:49,608
Indie development enters the recession period

892
00:43:49,948 --> 00:43:53,190
of its business cycle, a recession period

893
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:55,971
that I suspect will probably last for a very long time,

894
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:57,871
because it's tough to make a living as an artist.

895
00:44:00,432 --> 00:44:01,813
Other people are writing indie games now.

896
00:44:02,093 --> 00:44:02,833
It's a hot thing.

897
00:44:02,913 --> 00:44:04,134
It even gets to be in rooms.

898
00:44:05,554 --> 00:44:07,795
You all appear, and I quietly get old.

899
00:44:14,187 --> 00:44:18,369
I don't think anybody could have possibly imagined how big video games are going to get.

900
00:44:18,429 --> 00:44:22,010
It's over $100 billion a year, which is pretty big.

901
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:24,171
And this is a vicious industry.

902
00:44:24,231 --> 00:44:27,212
This is a nasty, competitive, bloodsport industry.

903
00:44:27,492 --> 00:44:31,314
And as much as we hate to think about it, we are to some extent in this room all in

904
00:44:31,394 --> 00:44:32,515
competition with each other.

905
00:44:32,755 --> 00:44:34,736
There is only a finite number of Humble slots.

906
00:44:34,756 --> 00:44:37,097
There is only a finite number of Steam front page slots.

907
00:44:42,525 --> 00:44:43,645
It's a zero-sum game.

908
00:44:43,825 --> 00:44:45,806
If I get an opportunity, someone else doesn't.

909
00:44:46,226 --> 00:44:48,406
But it is fantastic, perhaps necessary,

910
00:44:48,446 --> 00:44:51,347
that still sometimes we can come here as a summit

911
00:44:51,367 --> 00:44:53,647
to genuinely try to help each other.

912
00:44:54,048 --> 00:44:55,408
Because we're artists, and God knows

913
00:44:55,468 --> 00:44:56,548
nobody else cares about us.

914
00:44:57,148 --> 00:44:58,369
It's one of the few things that makes

915
00:44:58,849 --> 00:44:59,889
life doing this tolerable.

916
00:45:01,029 --> 00:45:03,290
Month and a half ago, we came out with another remaster,

917
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:04,830
Vernum 3 Ruined World.

918
00:45:05,090 --> 00:45:06,371
And it's doing quite well.

919
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:07,691
It's not setting the world on fire,

920
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:09,131
but we're going to be able to keep writing

921
00:45:09,151 --> 00:45:10,192
games for a couple more years.

922
00:45:10,944 --> 00:45:13,926
And I'm going to alternate between new games and remasters

923
00:45:14,066 --> 00:45:16,808
as long as I can handle it.

924
00:45:17,609 --> 00:45:19,890
And when I write a game, I'm making a whole new game

925
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:21,311
right now and a whole new IP.

926
00:45:21,411 --> 00:45:25,294
And whenever I have a question, I follow the same north star

927
00:45:25,314 --> 00:45:26,354
that I always have.

928
00:45:27,155 --> 00:45:29,416
My process is I figure out what I want to play,

929
00:45:29,757 --> 00:45:30,577
and then I make that.

930
00:45:31,118 --> 00:45:35,120
And if my taste ever gets so bad that I fall out

931
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:36,061
of line with the market.

932
00:45:36,403 --> 00:45:38,344
then I will receive my just punishment,

933
00:45:38,524 --> 00:45:40,704
and then I'll go write banking software or sell shoes.

934
00:45:42,464 --> 00:45:45,005
It helps that over the year, we have a big fan base.

935
00:45:45,045 --> 00:45:47,225
People drift out from being our fans for a decade

936
00:45:47,265 --> 00:45:48,386
and then float back.

937
00:45:48,886 --> 00:45:51,706
We have a long back catalog, which we mercilessly

938
00:45:51,786 --> 00:45:52,866
exploit whenever we can.

939
00:45:53,166 --> 00:45:54,387
And one of the great things is that never

940
00:45:54,427 --> 00:45:55,367
be ashamed of an old game.

941
00:45:55,387 --> 00:45:58,207
If a game's fun, 10 years later, it's still going to be fun.

942
00:45:58,627 --> 00:46:01,688
Never go to sleep on your old products.

943
00:46:01,768 --> 00:46:04,388
If you believed in it once, 10 years later,

944
00:46:04,588 --> 00:46:05,248
keep believing in it.

945
00:46:11,129 --> 00:46:13,210
But this is kind of the real question.

946
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:16,911
I've told you a story about how I managed to live a life

947
00:46:16,991 --> 00:46:19,192
I dreamed of as a child and that a lot of people envy.

948
00:46:20,133 --> 00:46:20,933
Can you do it too?

949
00:46:21,473 --> 00:46:22,413
And that's the big question.

950
00:46:22,514 --> 00:46:25,535
And honestly, I have to believe that it is possible.

951
00:46:25,895 --> 00:46:28,696
If you write quality games consistently,

952
00:46:29,016 --> 00:46:31,037
if you're tenacious, if people like your games,

953
00:46:31,137 --> 00:46:32,117
if you build up a fan base,

954
00:46:32,157 --> 00:46:34,078
if you have the tenacity of the cockroach,

955
00:46:34,738 --> 00:46:40,020
then you will eventually make it, maybe.

956
00:46:41,657 --> 00:46:44,159
Making a living as an artist is hard.

957
00:46:44,399 --> 00:46:46,501
It's always been hard, and it always will be hard.

958
00:46:46,581 --> 00:46:48,103
And I want to say reassuring things,

959
00:46:48,123 --> 00:46:51,226
but I'm too fundamentally honest to not.

960
00:46:52,867 --> 00:46:54,429
I have to tell the truth.

961
00:46:54,509 --> 00:46:55,590
It's possible, but it's rough.

962
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:57,371
And people ask all the time, do you

963
00:46:57,411 --> 00:46:59,793
think I have what it takes to make it?

964
00:46:59,854 --> 00:47:01,295
What do I need to do to make it?

965
00:47:01,955 --> 00:47:04,178
And my favorite quote about this comes

966
00:47:04,258 --> 00:47:07,861
from noted stand-up comedian and banjo enthusiast Steve Martin.

967
00:47:10,974 --> 00:47:15,337
You should always try to write games that pass the P test.

968
00:47:15,657 --> 00:47:18,439
You want to write a game that's so compelling that people

969
00:47:18,479 --> 00:47:19,319
forget to pee.

970
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,141
If you let people test your game and you tell them you can't play it

971
00:47:22,161 --> 00:47:23,242
anymore, you should always be shooting.

972
00:47:23,282 --> 00:47:25,403
There should always be one person out of your testers,

973
00:47:25,563 --> 00:47:28,085
one weirdo who's grabbing you by the lapels and going,

974
00:47:29,806 --> 00:47:30,946
I got to keep playing this game.

975
00:47:32,807 --> 00:47:34,448
That is the goal.

976
00:47:34,488 --> 00:47:35,229
And it's hard.

977
00:47:35,529 --> 00:47:37,510
My god, I know it's hard.

978
00:47:38,761 --> 00:47:42,064
And that's why you can't you can't quit your day job.

979
00:47:42,424 --> 00:47:47,808
You have to have until you have some confidence until you're sure.

980
00:47:47,828 --> 00:47:49,189
And again, this is a process thing.

981
00:47:49,249 --> 00:47:50,490
Some people will prove me wrong,

982
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:54,093
but I really believe unless you're absolutely sure, don't quit your day job

983
00:47:54,113 --> 00:47:55,694
until you've got the game that you're going.

984
00:47:55,954 --> 00:47:58,416
This is it. This game is addictive.

985
00:47:58,576 --> 00:48:01,458
I will bet my life on it because you kind of are.

986
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:04,321
So I just want to.

987
00:48:05,088 --> 00:48:09,252
end with a couple inspirational words just because I am fundamentally cheery.

988
00:48:11,134 --> 00:48:16,419
In all of the havoc and all of the terror, please occasionally take a moment to be proud.

989
00:48:18,521 --> 00:48:24,868
People who do what we do, people who are artists and musicians and whatnot, are carrying on

990
00:48:24,888 --> 00:48:28,131
a tradition that is as old as humanity.

991
00:48:29,652 --> 00:48:34,833
the compulsion when you see a blank canvas, a compulsion to fill that canvas with something,

992
00:48:35,113 --> 00:48:40,795
to take all of the weird stuff in your brain and go, and hope that it lands on someone

993
00:48:40,895 --> 00:48:42,495
and makes their life better.

994
00:48:45,376 --> 00:48:47,837
What we do is a noble thing.

995
00:48:49,417 --> 00:48:54,678
And I ask you, it's a rough road ahead, but I ask you to not forget it and to be proud.

996
00:48:56,899 --> 00:48:59,040
I will be taking questions for a short time.

997
00:49:08,186 --> 00:49:10,807
If you've got a question for Jeff, please come line up at the mic.

998
00:49:11,787 --> 00:49:15,509
While people are coming up, I will say, if you follow my Twitter, you've already seen

999
00:49:15,529 --> 00:49:15,669
this.

1000
00:49:16,549 --> 00:49:19,610
I was looking in my desk drawer and I found that this is a 3.5-inch floppy disk on it

1001
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:21,431
that says, in case of emergency.

1002
00:49:22,091 --> 00:49:25,172
I found it in my drawer where it's been sitting for about 15 years.

1003
00:49:25,532 --> 00:49:29,073
And at some point about 15 years ago, I remember making this disk.

1004
00:49:29,654 --> 00:49:33,855
I remember thinking, this thing, if I'm ever in trouble, I have to have this or everything's

1005
00:49:33,895 --> 00:49:34,475
going to explode.

1006
00:49:34,735 --> 00:49:36,516
And I copied something on a disk and put it in a drawer.

1007
00:49:36,903 --> 00:49:38,183
I have no idea what's on here.

1008
00:49:40,124 --> 00:49:41,544
All I know is I can never get rid of this.

1009
00:49:43,325 --> 00:49:44,906
I can never ever get rid of this thing.

1010
00:49:44,966 --> 00:49:46,386
I'm going to be buried with this.

1011
00:49:46,946 --> 00:49:50,127
This is in my coffin, my head's going to be on it like a pillow.

1012
00:49:50,568 --> 00:49:53,629
Someone on Twitter says, you know, it might be a Linux reboot disk.

1013
00:49:53,729 --> 00:49:56,610
Oh, yeah, like I'm going to take extra effort to keep running Linux.

1014
00:49:58,030 --> 00:49:59,371
Okay, there's your hot take.

1015
00:49:59,391 --> 00:49:59,551
Oh, sure.

1016
00:50:03,265 --> 00:50:05,005
So what was the degree you were working on?

1017
00:50:05,025 --> 00:50:07,747
What was the Jeff that we missed out on because you decided to make games?

1018
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:12,208
I was at Rutgers University in beautiful central New Jersey

1019
00:50:12,349 --> 00:50:15,450
working on a Ph.D. in applied mathematics

1020
00:50:16,070 --> 00:50:17,991
because the world needs much more of that.

1021
00:50:18,571 --> 00:50:21,532
And yeah, I just I just couldn't stand it.

1022
00:50:21,552 --> 00:50:24,874
The whole point of grad school is to make your life so miserable

1023
00:50:24,894 --> 00:50:27,475
that it forces you to decide to do something proper.

1024
00:50:27,495 --> 00:50:29,836
Hi.

1025
00:50:30,922 --> 00:50:37,787
I know who you are because I am working on my first indie RPG and I've looked at you and said that well

1026
00:50:38,267 --> 00:50:43,090
Theoretically, it's possible. Oh sure. I have not quit my J job yet. So I got that going for me

1027
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:47,573
Yeah, we're gonna game late at night. That's the that is the that is the artists tradition

1028
00:50:48,994 --> 00:50:54,778
So my question is is that maybe this is too personal for you to answer, but you know, I'm a one-man shop right now

1029
00:50:54,798 --> 00:50:58,140
Okay, you know, I have lots of programming and design experience

1030
00:50:58,632 --> 00:51:02,772
the art is where I'm like kind of struggling and so I'm at the point where I'm actually

1031
00:51:02,792 --> 00:51:07,213
starting to ask the question is like how do I move forward with that? Do I go with a very like

1032
00:51:07,473 --> 00:51:14,054
cheap indie look like some of you know your early games or do I like you know start investing in

1033
00:51:14,134 --> 00:51:17,795
people to like start making art for me and it's like more professional level and I guess I was

1034
00:51:17,815 --> 00:51:23,216
wondering what your insight of like when to know when to advance that. So I'm trying to bring up

1035
00:51:23,296 --> 00:51:25,216
this slide because this is the...

1036
00:51:28,037 --> 00:51:30,259
Okay, well, it's kind of visible.

1037
00:51:30,379 --> 00:51:34,721
So there's tons of free resources online.

1038
00:51:34,821 --> 00:51:38,103
My mind is just shattered by the depth

1039
00:51:38,183 --> 00:51:40,745
and the quality of resources you can license online

1040
00:51:41,085 --> 00:51:43,287
for free or very reasonably priced.

1041
00:51:43,907 --> 00:51:46,028
So be merciless.

1042
00:51:46,629 --> 00:51:48,350
You know, real artist-ship.

1043
00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:52,332
Find what it takes to get your thing off the launch pad

1044
00:51:52,912 --> 00:51:54,093
and download that.

1045
00:51:54,153 --> 00:51:56,515
And of course, it's gonna come up to your creativity

1046
00:51:56,555 --> 00:51:57,675
and a skill as a craftsman.

1047
00:51:58,116 --> 00:52:02,777
You're going to have to, you know, you go on open game art dot com, you're going to see 500 million icons.

1048
00:52:02,797 --> 00:52:06,198
You have to pick out the ones that work together in a cohesive whole cohesive whole.

1049
00:52:06,638 --> 00:52:09,499
You're probably get to the point where it gets in 90% of the way there.

1050
00:52:09,539 --> 00:52:12,660
And there are some things that you can only properly do with bespoke art.

1051
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,041
And when that happens, then you got to find a real artist.

1052
00:52:15,061 --> 00:52:16,481
You got to you got to pay out some money.

1053
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:19,742
And that's that's still my process when I'm designing a game.

1054
00:52:20,022 --> 00:52:23,363
I look at all of my resources, my like my own back catalog of art.

1055
00:52:23,463 --> 00:52:25,583
I look at the art that's free online that is of quality.

1056
00:52:25,957 --> 00:52:31,638
and I say OK what can I make for cheap but what do I got to pay a person for so my advice

1057
00:52:31,818 --> 00:52:36,719
make credit programmer download stuff from sites make credit programmer for the rest

1058
00:52:37,239 --> 00:52:42,620
make a game make it functional and then and then you know show it to people in playman

1059
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:46,800
as a as yourself do I got a live one here and if you do then then you know it's time

1060
00:52:47,541 --> 00:52:53,862
to deal with the whole other topic slash universe of pain that is finding and dealing with freelancers

1061
00:52:54,422 --> 00:52:55,762
but that yeah that's the best advice I can give.

1062
00:52:55,916 --> 00:53:01,961
I guess just a real quick follow-up, if it's not all about money, when do you know when

1063
00:53:02,201 --> 00:53:07,185
it's time to maybe advance your own skills and work on your art skills to be more full-featured

1064
00:53:07,245 --> 00:53:07,806
as opposed to...

1065
00:53:08,106 --> 00:53:08,887
It depends on who you are.

1066
00:53:09,868 --> 00:53:14,431
I'm bad at art, so I don't do it, but there are some people who are pretty good at art.

1067
00:53:16,173 --> 00:53:16,853
Make an icon.

1068
00:53:17,114 --> 00:53:17,694
See how it looks.

1069
00:53:17,854 --> 00:53:18,775
See how long it takes.

1070
00:53:18,835 --> 00:53:21,277
If your taste is good enough, you'll be able to tell if it's a good icon or not.

1071
00:53:21,745 --> 00:53:26,308
Figure out how long it takes, figure out how much money it would cost to have a freelancer do it,

1072
00:53:27,089 --> 00:53:29,390
see how much money you got on hand, and then make the call.

1073
00:53:29,410 --> 00:53:32,452
It's just the sort of business skills that you're going to have to develop yourself.

1074
00:53:32,852 --> 00:53:33,133
Thank you.

1075
00:53:33,553 --> 00:53:33,933
You're welcome.

1076
00:53:36,295 --> 00:53:36,975
Hi, good talk.

1077
00:53:37,335 --> 00:53:37,816
Thank you very much.

1078
00:53:37,856 --> 00:53:38,536
Two quick questions.

1079
00:53:39,116 --> 00:53:43,439
You had mentioned how fans could kind of turn from love to hate pretty quickly.

1080
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:46,381
Is it possible to go the other way around?

1081
00:53:46,581 --> 00:53:48,082
Oh, sure. Life is long.

1082
00:53:49,465 --> 00:53:52,606
You know, over a course of 25, 30, 50 years,

1083
00:53:53,206 --> 00:53:55,447
you know, it's like, a fan will like me,

1084
00:53:55,507 --> 00:53:57,008
and then they'll hate me, and then they'll go

1085
00:53:57,588 --> 00:53:59,769
live their life for 10 years and forget I exist,

1086
00:54:00,249 --> 00:54:01,630
and rediscover me again and go,

1087
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:04,191
yeah, you know, yeah, you know.

1088
00:54:04,611 --> 00:54:04,891
And...

1089
00:54:06,112 --> 00:54:08,653
Is it worth kinda like pursuing that particular moment

1090
00:54:08,673 --> 00:54:09,773
to try to convert them back,

1091
00:54:09,793 --> 00:54:12,074
or are you just kinda like break it there?

1092
00:54:12,414 --> 00:54:14,695
I, oh, I'm trying to convert my fans,

1093
00:54:14,875 --> 00:54:16,456
old fans back all the time through a process

1094
00:54:16,556 --> 00:54:17,836
that I call releasing a game.

1095
00:54:18,876 --> 00:54:21,899
I write the best thing that I can and put it out there.

1096
00:54:22,019 --> 00:54:24,301
I'm certainly not focusing on individuals.

1097
00:54:24,581 --> 00:54:26,043
And part of it, when I write so many games,

1098
00:54:26,163 --> 00:54:28,765
I don't expect anyone to play all of my games

1099
00:54:28,825 --> 00:54:31,167
because look at all this crap, Jesus Christ.

1100
00:54:32,088 --> 00:54:34,010
I write, work on two different series at the same time

1101
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:34,630
that are very different.

1102
00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:36,252
I have fans, people who are fans of one series

1103
00:54:36,292 --> 00:54:38,934
and hate the other series and vice versa.

1104
00:54:39,975 --> 00:54:41,456
Oh God, I had a really good point with that.

1105
00:54:42,658 --> 00:54:43,398
No, I guess I didn't.

1106
00:54:45,262 --> 00:54:52,687
No, I just make the things and when I make a decision, I just ask what really works for this.

1107
00:54:52,707 --> 00:54:55,429
And people are notoriously change-averse and risk-averse.

1108
00:54:55,469 --> 00:54:57,190
If you change something, you're always going to lose people.

1109
00:54:57,390 --> 00:54:59,191
But you've got to change things or you're going to go crazy.

1110
00:54:59,472 --> 00:55:00,232
So that's the game.

1111
00:55:00,272 --> 00:55:02,574
You always got to make sure that when you change and you do a new thing,

1112
00:55:02,834 --> 00:55:06,256
that thing you add is going to bring in fans to replace the ones you lost.

1113
00:55:07,157 --> 00:55:08,498
Or hopefully increase the number.

1114
00:55:09,155 --> 00:55:11,076
Do you feel like the majority of your fan base

1115
00:55:11,116 --> 00:55:13,297
existed before the Steam and Indie bubble?

1116
00:55:13,838 --> 00:55:14,298
Oh, yeah.

1117
00:55:14,318 --> 00:55:16,259
Remember, I was doing this for a living.

1118
00:55:16,279 --> 00:55:19,241
I started doing it for a living in 1995,

1119
00:55:19,822 --> 00:55:21,863
and Steam only became a thing that Indies

1120
00:55:21,903 --> 00:55:24,244
were crazy about 16 years later.

1121
00:55:24,304 --> 00:55:25,585
So I've been building fans forever.

1122
00:55:25,625 --> 00:55:26,626
I made my own mailing list.

1123
00:55:27,006 --> 00:55:29,007
If you can make your own mailing list, my god,

1124
00:55:29,027 --> 00:55:30,368
that's a good mailing list.

1125
00:55:30,408 --> 00:55:32,530
It's just a big red button that you hit it,

1126
00:55:32,550 --> 00:55:32,870
and $1,000 flies out.

1127
00:55:36,075 --> 00:55:38,017
Make a fan base, cultivate your fan base.

1128
00:55:38,057 --> 00:55:40,118
If at all possible, communicate with your fan base.

1129
00:55:40,438 --> 00:55:42,499
I mainly do it by email, but I'll always answer an email.

1130
00:55:42,619 --> 00:55:43,880
If someone cares about me that much,

1131
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,041
I'll always send their email back.

1132
00:55:46,222 --> 00:55:46,822
Cool, thank you.

1133
00:55:47,202 --> 00:55:47,522
You're welcome.

1134
00:55:47,562 --> 00:55:50,004
Hello.

1135
00:55:50,444 --> 00:55:50,604
Hi.

1136
00:55:50,985 --> 00:55:53,066
You mentioned about peaks and valleys

1137
00:55:53,126 --> 00:55:53,926
throughout your career.

1138
00:55:54,066 --> 00:55:54,247
Sure.

1139
00:55:55,007 --> 00:55:56,468
When it's a valley, how do you keep

1140
00:55:56,508 --> 00:56:00,270
the sort of emotional fortitude to keep going forward?

1141
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:06,753
So the question is, when it's valuable, when things are going hard, how do you keep your

1142
00:56:06,933 --> 00:56:09,753
emotions on an even keel?

1143
00:56:10,394 --> 00:56:15,395
And what I tend to use is methamphetamine, which is...

1144
00:56:15,415 --> 00:56:18,536
Oh, I meant for it.

1145
00:56:18,556 --> 00:56:19,096
Okay.

1146
00:56:20,777 --> 00:56:27,478
Again, this is a very individual, very human, very person-to-person case.

1147
00:56:28,059 --> 00:56:29,539
And I get terrified I work harder.

1148
00:56:30,198 --> 00:56:32,099
But I also I make sure to take time off.

1149
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:37,081
You know you're going to have hard times you're going to have

1150
00:56:37,101 --> 00:56:38,581
times when you're sad you're going to have times when you're

1151
00:56:38,661 --> 00:56:40,802
scared you're going to have times when you're angry you

1152
00:56:40,842 --> 00:56:43,783
still need to eat you know to sleep you still need to maintain

1153
00:56:43,823 --> 00:56:46,744
your relationships and you just got to find find your way to

1154
00:56:46,784 --> 00:56:49,265
manage that like like I said I'll look at my forms only that

1155
00:56:49,365 --> 00:56:53,027
my employees are forbidden to tell me how much money they're

1156
00:56:53,047 --> 00:56:53,747
making we're making.

1157
00:56:54,073 --> 00:56:55,293
I never look at my sales.

1158
00:56:55,493 --> 00:56:57,273
When I balance a checkbook every three months,

1159
00:56:57,293 --> 00:56:58,494
then I know how much money we're making.

1160
00:56:58,634 --> 00:56:59,274
Otherwise, I don't know,

1161
00:56:59,294 --> 00:57:00,774
because if I find out, it's just gonna stress me out.

1162
00:57:01,574 --> 00:57:04,195
You figure out, you know your own brain, and I don't.

1163
00:57:04,535 --> 00:57:06,315
Figure out the thing in your brain

1164
00:57:06,335 --> 00:57:07,896
that enables you to deal with the terror,

1165
00:57:07,916 --> 00:57:09,896
because you will always have some of the terror.

1166
00:57:11,636 --> 00:57:12,336
Thank you very much.

1167
00:57:12,476 --> 00:57:12,836
You're welcome.

1168
00:57:13,097 --> 00:57:18,818
Maybe I'll suggest an SSRI over methamphetamine.

1169
00:57:18,938 --> 00:57:20,278
No, no half measures, man.

1170
00:57:21,818 --> 00:57:22,698
I'm going out on top.

1171
00:57:24,090 --> 00:57:24,371
Yes.

1172
00:57:24,611 --> 00:57:25,271
Thanks for the talk.

1173
00:57:25,912 --> 00:57:27,453
I was wondering, if you were starting out today,

1174
00:57:27,753 --> 00:57:29,834
would you use your own engine again,

1175
00:57:29,854 --> 00:57:31,976
or would you choose some of the existing engines?

1176
00:57:32,816 --> 00:57:36,859
I'd probably make my own engine, because I'm a total code guy.

1177
00:57:36,959 --> 00:57:39,401
I enjoy programming enough and tech stuff enough.

1178
00:57:40,041 --> 00:57:43,563
And this is an area that people argue about a lot,

1179
00:57:43,603 --> 00:57:45,405
but I feel very passionately about.

1180
00:57:45,885 --> 00:57:50,208
If at all possible, own the source code for your stuff.

1181
00:57:51,002 --> 00:57:55,146
It is it has saved our butts so many time and some people are thinking right now.

1182
00:57:55,646 --> 00:57:56,987
I'm not a tech person.

1183
00:57:57,128 --> 00:57:57,708
I'm a creator.

1184
00:57:57,808 --> 00:58:00,831
I use and I use an engine so I don't have to learn how to code.

1185
00:58:00,891 --> 00:58:02,513
So my source code wouldn't do me any good.

1186
00:58:02,852 --> 00:58:05,635
to which I respond that what you may have overlooked is that you don't need to know

1187
00:58:05,675 --> 00:58:06,115
how to program.

1188
00:58:06,135 --> 00:58:09,458
If you have the source code, you find some hungry kid out of college, you hand him a

1189
00:58:09,498 --> 00:58:13,983
basket of our earth dollars, and you say, here's my mess, make it work.

1190
00:58:14,243 --> 00:58:18,006
And then they disappear, and they come back, and your engine works, they have money and

1191
00:58:18,046 --> 00:58:22,050
something to put on a resume, you have a working machine that spits out dollars, and you both

1192
00:58:22,090 --> 00:58:22,911
get on with your lives.

1193
00:58:23,051 --> 00:58:25,694
But you can only do it if you have the source code.

1194
00:58:26,214 --> 00:58:26,674
So that is...

1195
00:58:28,108 --> 00:58:30,189
much more than you asked, but it's definitely, yeah.

1196
00:58:30,269 --> 00:58:32,489
Yeah, I'd write my own engine, because I think it's fun.

1197
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:34,070
My engines suck, but I like writing them.

1198
00:58:34,670 --> 00:58:36,930
I'm sick of everything in my job,

1199
00:58:36,950 --> 00:58:38,110
so if there's something I like doing,

1200
00:58:38,130 --> 00:58:39,571
I grab onto it with both hands.

1201
00:58:39,591 --> 00:58:40,991
Awesome, thank you.

1202
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:41,631
Thank you.

1203
00:58:44,752 --> 00:58:46,192
So you mentioned that you release a game

1204
00:58:46,332 --> 00:58:47,892
about one game a year.

1205
00:58:47,912 --> 00:58:49,533
Yeah, one and a half years.

1206
00:58:49,913 --> 00:58:51,693
A little bit about the decision,

1207
00:58:51,813 --> 00:58:54,653
like is that a really deliberate choice to do one a year,

1208
00:58:55,154 --> 00:58:57,574
and how much of the personal deadline?

1209
00:58:58,161 --> 00:58:58,842
It works for me.

1210
00:58:58,962 --> 00:59:01,244
I find that if I've been working on one game for about a year

1211
00:59:01,284 --> 00:59:03,446
and a half, I either need to ship it or do a Hemingway.

1212
00:59:04,567 --> 00:59:07,830
I just can't stand looking at it anymore.

1213
00:59:07,850 --> 00:59:09,071
So I get it a year and a half.

1214
00:59:09,131 --> 00:59:09,892
It's a full game.

1215
00:59:09,952 --> 00:59:10,893
It's basically functional.

1216
00:59:10,913 --> 00:59:14,977
I've made it 25% better, fixed, made 25% of what was bad

1217
00:59:14,997 --> 00:59:15,958
in the last one better.

1218
00:59:15,978 --> 00:59:18,400
I kick it out and go on to the next thing.

1219
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:21,002
I like having a lot of different games, and I think it's fun.

1220
00:59:21,443 --> 00:59:22,564
We only have a few seconds left.

1221
00:59:22,604 --> 00:59:23,865
Two final pieces of advice.

1222
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:26,382
Don't be proud of not getting enough sleep.

1223
00:59:26,602 --> 00:59:28,705
You need sleep to live.

1224
00:59:29,225 --> 00:59:34,731
And two, get a chair that's good for your back, because when your back goes, my God,

1225
00:59:34,751 --> 00:59:35,412
you're going to miss it.

1226
00:59:36,993 --> 00:59:37,554
Thank you very much.
