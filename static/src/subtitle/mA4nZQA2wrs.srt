1
00:00:03,186 --> 00:00:13,376
Hey everybody, how you doing?

2
00:00:14,838 --> 00:00:15,158
Thank you.

3
00:00:19,752 --> 00:00:28,834
Welcome to my talk. My name is Jeff Van Dyke, and I hope you're ready for some exciting Foley fun.

4
00:00:30,715 --> 00:00:37,116
In putting this talk together, I realized it's probably more of a post-mortem and a pipeline talk for that matter,

5
00:00:38,137 --> 00:00:42,898
and ultimately how the audio in Unpacking came to be.

6
00:00:44,138 --> 00:00:52,087
I'm going to start on the story of our process, but then also get deeper into the technical workflow.

7
00:00:53,448 --> 00:00:58,854
I think most experienced people here who are audio people will know the stuff I'm showing already.

8
00:00:58,914 --> 00:01:00,075
It might be a bit redundant.

9
00:01:01,277 --> 00:01:04,240
But I think maybe there might be a few things we did differently that...

10
00:01:05,721 --> 00:01:09,502
or incorrectly for that matter, and we can both kind of learn from it going forward.

11
00:01:11,143 --> 00:01:15,184
An interesting thing that I discovered is throughout this whole project is the

12
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:22,266
reoccurring theme is underestimation on my part. I underestimated how big this project was going

13
00:01:22,286 --> 00:01:30,929
to be from the get-go, and I've also underestimated the response to it as well. So, welcome.

14
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:36,062
So who's Jeff and why are we listening to him?

15
00:01:36,562 --> 00:01:38,583
And why am I talking about myself in the third person?

16
00:01:38,643 --> 00:01:41,744
I don't know.

17
00:01:42,184 --> 00:01:43,044
My name's Jeff Van Dyke.

18
00:01:43,105 --> 00:01:45,666
I'm a composer, a sound designer, an audio director.

19
00:01:45,686 --> 00:01:51,388
I got started in 1992 at Electronic Arts Canada

20
00:01:51,448 --> 00:01:52,148
in Vancouver.

21
00:01:52,168 --> 00:01:56,770
I worked on games like Skitchin, the very first FIFA,

22
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:59,571
the first Need for Speed, a lot of firsts there

23
00:01:59,671 --> 00:02:00,051
back in the 90s.

24
00:02:02,393 --> 00:02:09,621
And then in 97 I moved to Australia and started working with the Creative Assembly in the UK.

25
00:02:09,781 --> 00:02:11,343
It's a weird connection there, but it happened.

26
00:02:12,104 --> 00:02:19,212
And working for Creative Assembly, I worked for them for about 10 years on different Total War games, starting with Shogun.

27
00:02:20,093 --> 00:02:21,373
Rome, Total War, Medieval.

28
00:02:22,714 --> 00:02:24,475
After all that time on Total War,

29
00:02:25,535 --> 00:02:26,856
the last thing I did with those guys

30
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:29,857
was this game called Alien Isolation, which

31
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:33,318
was probably the biggest AAA title that I worked on.

32
00:02:34,078 --> 00:02:38,260
And at that point, I stopped working on AAA titles

33
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,861
and switched to working with indies

34
00:02:42,682 --> 00:02:43,742
and haven't looked back since.

35
00:02:44,182 --> 00:02:46,223
And I quite like working with indies, actually.

36
00:02:46,243 --> 00:02:48,144
AAA is typically very.

37
00:02:48,504 --> 00:02:52,705
corporate, and I find working with indies much more personal

38
00:02:53,085 --> 00:02:54,826
and getting to know people a lot closer.

39
00:02:54,846 --> 00:02:58,987
Also a bit more multifaceted in what you have to do,

40
00:02:59,147 --> 00:03:02,368
not just audio, some of the biz dev stuff and what have you.

41
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:07,530
OK, so what's unpacking?

42
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,311
They say a picture is worth 1,000 words,

43
00:03:11,811 --> 00:03:13,051
so a trailer must be at least 1,500.

44
00:03:17,226 --> 00:03:19,514
And this is quiet, this should have sound.

45
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:21,622
There we go.

46
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:28,964
Unpacking is a zen game about the familiar experience of pulling possessions out of boxes

47
00:03:29,405 --> 00:03:34,709
and fitting them into a new home. It's part puzzle, part decoration. You create a satisfying

48
00:03:34,749 --> 00:03:41,374
living space while learning clues about the life you're unpacking. There's over eight house moves,

49
00:03:42,274 --> 00:03:47,258
no sorry, over eight house moves, you gain a sense of intimacy with a character you never see

50
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,702
and a story you're never told. It's pretty deep.

51
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:07,585
There we go.

52
00:05:08,626 --> 00:05:09,587
Oh, thank you.

53
00:05:12,409 --> 00:05:12,789
Thank you.

54
00:05:14,591 --> 00:05:17,593
So how did Unpacking come about?

55
00:05:21,096 --> 00:05:25,160
Unpacking was inspired by two members of our team falling

56
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,681
in love and moving in together.

57
00:05:27,261 --> 00:05:30,804
Literally, the game came to them while unpacking Tim's stuff

58
00:05:31,445 --> 00:05:32,345
into Ren's house.

59
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:37,294
They would normally be here with the rest of our team,

60
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:41,697
but I think they're a little worse for wear after last night's awards ceremony,

61
00:05:42,177 --> 00:05:43,918
so we'll catch up with them later.

62
00:05:44,538 --> 00:05:46,760
But the rest of our team is sitting here right in the front.

63
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,742
Snotten and Angus here from Witchbeam.

64
00:05:51,122 --> 00:05:54,524
And yeah, so that's how the game came about.

65
00:05:56,705 --> 00:05:58,026
Then what's this talk about then?

66
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,527
And I promise I won't do that joke anymore.

67
00:06:01,348 --> 00:06:03,489
Soon after Unpacking's launch, there

68
00:06:03,509 --> 00:06:08,732
was a tweet that went viral in November 2021 that stated,

69
00:06:08,752 --> 00:06:12,255
oh, and this is from Francesco Del Pia.

70
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:14,496
He says, excuse me, what?

71
00:06:16,157 --> 00:06:17,218
And posted this video.

72
00:06:55,723 --> 00:07:00,404
possibly one of the most riveting pieces of cinema shown at GDC.

73
00:07:07,247 --> 00:07:08,187
I have no idea what that is.

74
00:07:11,408 --> 00:07:11,848
Thank you.

75
00:07:11,868 --> 00:07:14,249
I don't know what that sound was.

76
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:22,051
Anyways, that video had over a million views, and then came the responses to that tweet.

77
00:07:24,401 --> 00:07:29,324
Max from Audio Kinetic, who make Wwise, said,

78
00:07:29,964 --> 00:07:31,966
14,000 Foley audio files, right?

79
00:07:32,266 --> 00:07:33,026
Dear God.

80
00:07:33,407 --> 00:07:36,929
And I'm like, yup, we had Reaper render the audio files

81
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:39,190
into a deep folder structure that represented

82
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,931
the containers and hierarchy in Wwise,

83
00:07:41,071 --> 00:07:42,652
then used a single template container

84
00:07:42,692 --> 00:07:45,474
to map all the sounds to the correct surface switches.

85
00:07:45,874 --> 00:07:47,835
I felt giddy every time we did this process.

86
00:07:48,015 --> 00:07:49,076
It was magical.

87
00:07:49,987 --> 00:07:50,967
Why am I talking like that?

88
00:07:51,148 --> 00:07:54,951
Anyway, so Polygon did an article on it.

89
00:07:54,991 --> 00:07:56,592
They were impressed with the number of sounds.

90
00:07:57,613 --> 00:08:00,395
And my friend John Passfield tweeted,

91
00:08:00,435 --> 00:08:03,778
there should be a GDC talk in just managing the spreadsheet

92
00:08:03,818 --> 00:08:04,859
required for this game.

93
00:08:04,939 --> 00:08:06,641
And I'm like, hey.

94
00:08:10,544 --> 00:08:12,766
So here we are.

95
00:08:13,947 --> 00:08:16,769
All right, my first approach to the audio.

96
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,741
Had a brief discussion with Ren and Tim about audio styles.

97
00:08:21,861 --> 00:08:23,302
We had a little bit of back and forth

98
00:08:24,142 --> 00:08:27,263
and kind of came up with a high level audio concept.

99
00:08:28,864 --> 00:08:31,905
The pixel art, we felt, should have chip tunes.

100
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:34,706
That felt like a good match, except that we

101
00:08:34,746 --> 00:08:38,047
would add acoustic instruments like guitars and stuff

102
00:08:38,067 --> 00:08:40,248
like that, and ultimately.

103
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:44,550
made different instruments represent different characters

104
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:45,110
in the game.

105
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:48,671
So the music kind of progresses as you play the game,

106
00:08:49,031 --> 00:08:54,313
and the instrumentation changes as the game progresses.

107
00:08:54,753 --> 00:08:56,934
So the chip tune thing felt like a good idea.

108
00:08:57,674 --> 00:08:59,375
But then I thought, well, should we also

109
00:08:59,395 --> 00:09:02,276
have chip sound effects, little beeps and boops?

110
00:09:03,197 --> 00:09:03,377
And

111
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:06,498
Ultimately, we didn't decide to do that.

112
00:09:06,538 --> 00:09:08,959
But for the sake of this talk, I put a little example

113
00:09:09,499 --> 00:09:12,701
of what that would have been like in Francesco's video.

114
00:09:18,964 --> 00:09:21,445
Now, I spent five minutes putting this demo together,

115
00:09:21,465 --> 00:09:21,625
this bit.

116
00:09:23,747 --> 00:09:24,828
So it's a bit underwhelming.

117
00:09:25,548 --> 00:09:28,069
And I possibly could have gone crazy with synthesis

118
00:09:28,129 --> 00:09:30,770
and made really interesting synthetic impact sounds.

119
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:33,031
But I just chose not to do that because I

120
00:09:33,071 --> 00:09:35,291
thought it would have been, well, actually, I just

121
00:09:35,311 --> 00:09:36,472
didn't feel like doing it, I'll be honest.

122
00:09:37,999 --> 00:09:38,920
So it didn't go that way.

123
00:09:40,421 --> 00:09:41,703
Then I thought of this idea, well,

124
00:09:42,203 --> 00:09:45,967
because the pixel art sort of has this impressionistic vibe

125
00:09:46,007 --> 00:09:49,410
to it in that there's a certain amount of missing detail out

126
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,331
of the visual because it's pixel art.

127
00:09:51,552 --> 00:09:53,453
And that's the charm of pixel artists

128
00:09:53,573 --> 00:09:57,117
is what they choose to show and what they choose not to.

129
00:09:57,777 --> 00:09:59,179
And I wanted to.

130
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:04,425
I decided that I thought it'd be really cool if while that didn't have full detail,

131
00:10:04,465 --> 00:10:07,248
what if the audio had like tons of detail?

132
00:10:07,308 --> 00:10:08,470
It's hyper-realistic.

133
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,851
And so I thought that was a good idea.

134
00:10:11,276 --> 00:10:13,477
At this point, early on in the project,

135
00:10:13,857 --> 00:10:16,759
we didn't know how many items needed to be recorded.

136
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:20,861
And we also didn't really know the scope of the game.

137
00:10:21,021 --> 00:10:24,482
So I just thought, all right, give me a list of things,

138
00:10:24,562 --> 00:10:25,503
and I'll start recording it.

139
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,104
So this is a photo from my kitchen,

140
00:10:28,204 --> 00:10:31,866
me recording the box opening and closing sound.

141
00:10:33,262 --> 00:10:39,844
And for the audio people out there, that's a Rode NT2A microphone and a Tascam D40

142
00:10:40,944 --> 00:10:44,605
recording unit, both of which we didn't end up using for the final game

143
00:10:45,805 --> 00:10:54,547
because that mic is a vocal mic and recorded too much ambience. And that recording unit has a bit

144
00:10:54,567 --> 00:10:58,908
of a noisy input, I found. So, and when you're recording really quiet stuff, you need really

145
00:11:00,068 --> 00:11:02,909
high quality inputs on your audio equipment.

146
00:11:05,151 --> 00:11:11,535
Side note, after taking or doing this recording session, two days later I wrote the theme song to Unpacking,

147
00:11:11,895 --> 00:11:18,600
and it was one of those compositions that just sort of came out of nowhere, just went, and it was done in two hours.

148
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:22,763
And you know, if you're into writing music, you know, that doesn't happen very often.

149
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:27,966
I was really lucky in that that ended up being the theme song, which I thought was quite interesting.

150
00:11:29,068 --> 00:11:33,938
So anyways, we did this recording and Tim and Ren made the prototype and we put it all together

151
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:36,403
And so this is the prototype from 2018 of unpacking

152
00:12:03,817 --> 00:12:04,618
It's quite similar.

153
00:12:04,638 --> 00:12:08,001
I don't know if you can hear it there,

154
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:09,783
but there's a really nice ambience

155
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:15,568
in the recordings of those sounds.

156
00:12:16,088 --> 00:12:17,269
I just did a little cheat there that

157
00:12:17,349 --> 00:12:19,471
unpacks everything instantly, which is not

158
00:12:19,511 --> 00:12:20,813
in the final game, by the way.

159
00:12:22,914 --> 00:12:25,177
But you'll notice here, all these things sound the same.

160
00:12:26,476 --> 00:12:30,839
And I'm immediately broken out of the game, out of the immersion.

161
00:12:31,339 --> 00:12:35,262
And so it was putting this together, we learned as we went,

162
00:12:35,882 --> 00:12:38,283
oh, we're going to need a lot of detail in this.

163
00:12:38,344 --> 00:12:40,405
We need the sound of things stacking on each other.

164
00:12:40,425 --> 00:12:43,167
We need, you know, small plates, large plates.

165
00:12:45,428 --> 00:12:46,749
And yeah, so.

166
00:12:49,481 --> 00:12:53,667
The other thing we realized is there's not a lot going on in the soundscape here, right?

167
00:12:53,747 --> 00:13:00,077
So there's a lot of room for us to focus on all this fully and the detail in it,

168
00:13:00,438 --> 00:13:03,522
which was a big advantage for us because if you think about it like a...

169
00:13:04,323 --> 00:13:06,284
first-person shooter game or something like that.

170
00:13:07,185 --> 00:13:08,486
There's so much chaos going on,

171
00:13:08,506 --> 00:13:10,206
you never get to really appreciate that.

172
00:13:11,007 --> 00:13:12,828
Typically in those games, there's a lot of detail

173
00:13:12,868 --> 00:13:15,349
in like the footsteps going across different surfaces

174
00:13:15,449 --> 00:13:17,530
and different speeds and movement types.

175
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:20,892
I wouldn't be surprised if this 14,000 number

176
00:13:21,012 --> 00:13:24,413
is a typical number in a AAA title

177
00:13:24,453 --> 00:13:25,874
with tons of stuff going on.

178
00:13:26,835 --> 00:13:29,496
But in our game, because there's so much space,

179
00:13:29,736 --> 00:13:30,356
we all have this...

180
00:13:31,017 --> 00:13:32,878
There's so much time for us to sit there and appreciate

181
00:13:32,918 --> 00:13:33,938
the quality of the sounds.

182
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:40,642
So at this point, I thought this was

183
00:13:40,662 --> 00:13:41,743
going to be an easy project.

184
00:13:42,723 --> 00:13:45,005
I'll bang this out in a couple of months by myself.

185
00:13:45,285 --> 00:13:48,066
I assume, you know, underestimation, right?

186
00:13:49,207 --> 00:13:51,168
So the results of that prototype,

187
00:13:51,188 --> 00:13:52,429
these were my takeaways.

188
00:13:52,529 --> 00:13:54,590
The natural kitchen ambience sounded awesome.

189
00:13:57,463 --> 00:14:00,345
Shared item sounds didn't sound so good,

190
00:14:00,385 --> 00:14:03,147
so I'm going to need to record more.

191
00:14:03,747 --> 00:14:06,388
I figured I'd record a few new variants and jobs done.

192
00:14:06,648 --> 00:14:06,949
Awesome.

193
00:14:08,329 --> 00:14:13,412
But then got some information from the designers,

194
00:14:13,432 --> 00:14:14,813
and they said, oh, actually, we're

195
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,434
going to have multiple rooms, and items

196
00:14:16,494 --> 00:14:17,875
can move in between them.

197
00:14:19,075 --> 00:14:22,197
And I'm like, so does anybody see

198
00:14:22,217 --> 00:14:23,037
what the problem with this is?

199
00:14:26,947 --> 00:14:28,408
I had recorded all the sounds in the kitchen.

200
00:14:28,428 --> 00:14:30,889
There's all this ambience on these sounds.

201
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,651
Imagine you take that same sound,

202
00:14:32,691 --> 00:14:34,852
play it when you move into the bedroom.

203
00:14:34,932 --> 00:14:36,553
The bedrooms are typically really dead.

204
00:14:36,593 --> 00:14:37,454
There's no reverb.

205
00:14:37,894 --> 00:14:39,455
And now you're hearing this ambient sound

206
00:14:39,655 --> 00:14:41,016
in a dead bedroom.

207
00:14:41,036 --> 00:14:41,957
So it would have sounded.

208
00:14:43,378 --> 00:14:45,900
So that was a bit of an issue.

209
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:48,341
That means I'm going to have to rerecord all this stuff again.

210
00:14:49,382 --> 00:14:50,503
So that's a bit of an issue.

211
00:14:50,983 --> 00:14:54,926
And basically, the scope of the game had been clarified

212
00:14:55,206 --> 00:14:56,727
in terms of just the size of it.

213
00:14:57,448 --> 00:15:00,931
And so this was going to be interesting.

214
00:15:01,011 --> 00:15:03,552
What I did is I did some math.

215
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:05,134
There was going to be around 500 items in the game.

216
00:15:07,455 --> 00:15:09,756
15 surfaces, 10 variants.

217
00:15:10,016 --> 00:15:12,837
And by variants, I mean like just when I was recording stuff,

218
00:15:12,897 --> 00:15:15,378
I was picking things up and down 10 times.

219
00:15:15,418 --> 00:15:17,318
So there'd be a lot of variation when you hear

220
00:15:17,358 --> 00:15:18,699
the same thing over and over.

221
00:15:19,379 --> 00:15:21,660
This adds up to 75,000 audio files.

222
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,781
And I was like, what?

223
00:15:25,001 --> 00:15:25,961
How am I going to deal with this?

224
00:15:25,981 --> 00:15:27,902
I don't know how I'm going to deal with this.

225
00:15:28,182 --> 00:15:29,002
Just like Doc here.

226
00:15:30,223 --> 00:15:31,403
And so I left the building.

227
00:15:31,423 --> 00:15:33,144
Yeah.

228
00:15:35,841 --> 00:15:37,282
My second approach to the audio.

229
00:15:39,323 --> 00:15:41,164
I know, I'll get my daughter Ella to help me.

230
00:15:41,925 --> 00:15:44,987
And she was going to uni at the time, learning music

231
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:45,487
production.

232
00:15:46,428 --> 00:15:48,289
But she was on a break, and I said, hey, Ella,

233
00:15:48,309 --> 00:15:49,730
could you record some stuff for me?

234
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,931
So this is her in our spare bedroom,

235
00:15:52,932 --> 00:15:55,834
recording this stuff in our dead room now.

236
00:15:57,755 --> 00:15:59,676
And I have a quick example here.

237
00:15:59,696 --> 00:16:01,658
I really apologize for the quality of this video.

238
00:16:02,178 --> 00:16:04,640
I actually think I was, I thought I was.

239
00:16:06,317 --> 00:16:12,906
taking photos but I was accidentally taking video but you can see what's going on

240
00:16:19,434 --> 00:16:20,095
exciting stuff

241
00:16:21,909 --> 00:16:27,172
As you can see there though, the items we recorded were very literally the things that were in the game.

242
00:16:27,432 --> 00:16:32,174
We weren't doing that classic Foley artist thing of using one thing to mimic another.

243
00:16:32,274 --> 00:16:38,157
We did record as much as possible the actual thing that was in there.

244
00:16:40,006 --> 00:16:53,080
Maybe where we improvised was what we were using for the surfaces, but that is like a benchtop and we had a shelf and we had, I think we used a cookie tray for the sound of putting stuff on the stove and stuff like that.

245
00:16:57,345 --> 00:16:59,686
But then, so Ella was busy working on that stuff,

246
00:16:59,726 --> 00:17:01,588
but then she got busy graduating,

247
00:17:01,608 --> 00:17:04,610
and you know, how can I argue about that?

248
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:06,171
This sort of proud dad moment here.

249
00:17:06,231 --> 00:17:09,293
So she graduated with honors,

250
00:17:09,513 --> 00:17:12,735
and she actually is just releasing

251
00:17:12,775 --> 00:17:14,376
her first video game soundtrack

252
00:17:14,496 --> 00:17:16,718
for a game called Fort's High Seas.

253
00:17:16,758 --> 00:17:18,659
That gets launched tomorrow, actually.

254
00:17:18,719 --> 00:17:21,441
So I couldn't be prouder, and she did a,

255
00:17:21,901 --> 00:17:23,322
she's just, it's really awesome.

256
00:17:24,463 --> 00:17:24,743
Thank you.

257
00:17:25,023 --> 00:17:25,403
Go, Ella.

258
00:17:27,584 --> 00:17:28,565
That's really cool, thank you.

259
00:17:30,267 --> 00:17:31,628
Yeah, I think she's going to do amazing things.

260
00:17:32,269 --> 00:17:36,874
So now I'm in a situation where I started thinking,

261
00:17:36,994 --> 00:17:37,935
what am I going to do next?

262
00:17:38,275 --> 00:17:40,738
So I'm just thinking, thinking while looking

263
00:17:40,778 --> 00:17:42,900
at a wooden seagull, and thinking

264
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,242
while staring into your souls.

265
00:17:46,964 --> 00:17:48,766
And I came to the conclusion that I

266
00:17:48,786 --> 00:17:50,307
think a lot of people in my situation

267
00:17:50,347 --> 00:17:50,948
would have, uh,

268
00:17:52,131 --> 00:17:55,693
came in the conclusion that I would have come to was,

269
00:17:56,073 --> 00:17:57,174
help, I need my wife.

270
00:17:59,175 --> 00:18:01,557
Now, I'm choosing this picture for this slide

271
00:18:01,597 --> 00:18:04,719
because she came up with the idea of when you put the duck

272
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:06,060
down on the ground, it quacks.

273
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,602
So I thought that was such a great idea.

274
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:13,845
So our third approach to the audio.

275
00:18:16,391 --> 00:18:23,837
This is my wife Angela. She's awesome, talented, super smart, and beautiful too, in every way.

276
00:18:24,918 --> 00:18:34,066
And I met her at EA in the 90s, and she has worked on a lot of different games herself, as a dialogue and foley producer.

277
00:18:35,067 --> 00:18:35,948
very convenient.

278
00:18:37,629 --> 00:18:42,552
And she worked on early EA Sports titles, Triple Play, NBA.

279
00:18:43,213 --> 00:18:45,895
She sang some vocals on a bunch of songs of mine.

280
00:18:45,935 --> 00:18:51,859
She co-wrote some of the songs, too, on Need for Speed and the Total War series.

281
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:52,920
And then...

282
00:18:54,520 --> 00:19:01,272
She, on Submerged there, she helped me with the Foley implementation in Unreal and stuff,

283
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:04,579
and she kind of is Unreal, so that's awesome.

284
00:19:05,735 --> 00:19:11,259
So we discussed this and came up with some assumptions about our process.

285
00:19:13,301 --> 00:19:17,945
These are very common. Manually naming files is time-consuming, mind-melting, and sucks.

286
00:19:19,306 --> 00:19:24,770
Editing can be slow and tedious. We thought we would try and automate things as much as possible.

287
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:29,574
We weren't sure what we were going to need audio file-wise in terms of the end result,

288
00:19:29,594 --> 00:19:33,216
like if it needed to be loud, quiet, mono, stereo, sample rates.

289
00:19:33,516 --> 00:19:37,919
So we wanted to keep everything non-destructive so we could keep changing our mind.

290
00:19:37,939 --> 00:19:42,342
The only thing we kept destructive was the initial pass of noise reduction because noise sucks.

291
00:19:45,925 --> 00:19:49,967
And we wanted to make the process easy to repeat with different audio settings

292
00:19:50,067 --> 00:19:51,148
so we could iterate quickly.

293
00:19:52,479 --> 00:19:58,283
And so this is a little excerpt from Ange's blog of her doing the process.

294
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:10,771
Hey everyone, this is Angela Van Dyke and here I am in our sort of little makeshift Foley studio.

295
00:20:11,872 --> 00:20:19,317
I am working on a beautiful game called Unpacking and it's being made by our fabulous team at Witchbeam.

296
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:28,894
And I've spent a lot of time in this Foley recording situation

297
00:20:28,954 --> 00:20:32,677
because in unpacking, you unpack lots and lots of things

298
00:20:32,757 --> 00:20:34,679
and you move them around from place to place.

299
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:38,162
And it sounds just like it would in real life.

300
00:20:38,202 --> 00:20:41,725
And that's because I have recorded every item

301
00:20:42,426 --> 00:20:46,309
on every surface that you can put it down on in the game.

302
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:49,832
So I'm going to bring you along. I'm just going to press record.

303
00:20:50,552 --> 00:20:55,476
And we're recording a little postcard now on tile.

304
00:20:56,116 --> 00:20:58,458
So this is cardboard light on tile.

305
00:20:58,478 --> 00:20:58,518
So

306
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:15,089
and that's how I do it.

307
00:21:16,688 --> 00:21:21,990
there is a little bit more involved. I'd have to, you know, do a bit of technical stuff and set

308
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:26,911
levels and all of that and perform it. Usually it takes two hands to perform because you have

309
00:21:26,931 --> 00:21:34,532
to put it down and pick it up just so or it sounds terrible. There you go! For those of

310
00:21:34,572 --> 00:21:39,073
you who love all those little sounds of all the things in unpacking, that's how I do it.

311
00:21:40,689 --> 00:21:41,229
Go, Aang.

312
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:44,951
So from there, we would go into editing.

313
00:21:45,591 --> 00:21:48,572
And yes, I'm going to show you a video of me actually editing,

314
00:21:48,652 --> 00:21:49,793
because it's exciting.

315
00:21:51,093 --> 00:21:54,915
So we would, here's a take with multiple items in one take.

316
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:57,876
And we would prefix each take with what it is.

317
00:22:08,492 --> 00:22:10,772
And this made it fairly quick because we could set up a surface,

318
00:22:12,013 --> 00:22:17,014
get all the items and then just fly through them in one giant take on this surface.

319
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:23,356
Now what I'm doing is, Reaper has a function called Dynamic Split,

320
00:22:23,896 --> 00:22:27,157
which removes the silence in between transients of sounds.

321
00:22:27,337 --> 00:22:31,279
So it turns one giant audio file into multiple audio files.

322
00:22:32,859 --> 00:22:35,560
And now all I do is need to just delete the audio.

323
00:22:37,808 --> 00:22:39,389
delete the audio that I don't need.

324
00:22:41,191 --> 00:22:44,895
And this process was really quick for us.

325
00:22:46,616 --> 00:22:51,781
It also edited things really tight and made it so,

326
00:22:53,263 --> 00:22:57,027
granted, we made a lot of audio files,

327
00:22:57,087 --> 00:22:59,249
but this editing process was really fast.

328
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,402
So what I'm doing now is I'm separating the pickups

329
00:23:02,502 --> 00:23:06,285
from the places, and I'm putting them onto separate tracks.

330
00:23:06,345 --> 00:23:10,389
And now what this means is that I have separate tracks

331
00:23:10,509 --> 00:23:12,971
and can process them separately, have them in different volumes,

332
00:23:14,252 --> 00:23:15,694
add some EQ or whatever.

333
00:23:16,374 --> 00:23:19,837
But also, it means that I can name them uniquely.

334
00:23:19,897 --> 00:23:24,201
By only naming the tracks, I can use these to name the files,

335
00:23:24,802 --> 00:23:27,464
as well as the folders that we're going to render to.

336
00:23:28,881 --> 00:23:30,422
So in this folder is called Benchtop,

337
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:32,484
because that's the surface that it was placed on.

338
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:36,087
And now what I'm doing is I'm creating a region

339
00:23:36,247 --> 00:23:39,590
around these audio files,

340
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:43,753
and I'm naming the region the name of the item.

341
00:23:43,773 --> 00:23:45,875
In this case, it's Ceramic Light.

342
00:23:48,797 --> 00:23:48,958
And

343
00:23:50,768 --> 00:23:53,270
Now I'm running this action, a Reaper action,

344
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:56,752
called renameSelectedItemsWithPatterns, v2,

345
00:23:57,032 --> 00:24:00,234
by xRame, who was nice enough to make a tweak to this script

346
00:24:00,294 --> 00:24:02,216
for me to suit our needs.

347
00:24:03,156 --> 00:24:05,098
And you feed this pattern.

348
00:24:06,018 --> 00:24:08,420
In this case, it's region, parent track, track.

349
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,901
So region is the item.

350
00:24:11,062 --> 00:24:15,184
Parent track is the surface and track is the action pickup or place.

351
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:21,848
And there it's just renamed everything super quickly, exactly the way we specified.

352
00:24:23,989 --> 00:24:30,713
And yeah, this process worked really well for us. You can see things are named properly there.

353
00:24:33,334 --> 00:24:36,555
So now, oh, now the other thing that happens

354
00:24:36,615 --> 00:24:37,856
is that the regions that you create

355
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:39,396
get listed on the side here,

356
00:24:39,857 --> 00:24:43,198
and that region list becomes like bookmarks in your project.

357
00:24:43,238 --> 00:24:45,259
So if you click on a region, the cursor goes to that,

358
00:24:45,699 --> 00:24:48,220
and it just made it really, really quick to manage.

359
00:24:49,261 --> 00:24:50,982
So then we're gonna, now we're gonna render it.

360
00:24:51,322 --> 00:24:53,683
And this shows you how big the actual,

361
00:24:53,743 --> 00:24:57,525
this is the master Foley project file for unpacking.

362
00:24:58,125 --> 00:24:59,786
And as you can see, as I zoom out here,

363
00:24:59,826 --> 00:25:02,187
it just gets absolutely ridiculous.

364
00:25:03,891 --> 00:25:05,532
to the point where it's like, what were we thinking?

365
00:25:07,912 --> 00:25:09,673
So as you can see, there's the region list

366
00:25:09,713 --> 00:25:10,993
on the right side of everything.

367
00:25:12,954 --> 00:25:14,994
On the left is the tracks.

368
00:25:15,434 --> 00:25:18,715
The reason why we did it this way is because I can quickly

369
00:25:19,056 --> 00:25:22,717
jump from one sound to another and quickly compare quite

370
00:25:23,617 --> 00:25:25,457
easily one sound to another.

371
00:25:27,662 --> 00:25:35,367
And now what I'm doing is I'm showing how we had to stagger the sounds across the surfaces from left to right

372
00:25:35,387 --> 00:25:37,789
because otherwise they would all play at once.

373
00:25:38,509 --> 00:25:42,892
And that's what caused the project to just get spread over such a huge amount of time.

374
00:25:44,539 --> 00:25:46,901
OK, so what I'm doing here now is I'm

375
00:25:46,941 --> 00:25:48,943
taking everything in the whole project

376
00:25:49,023 --> 00:25:50,444
and renaming it in one step.

377
00:25:51,045 --> 00:25:53,567
And that just what I just showed you there, that just renamed,

378
00:25:54,168 --> 00:25:58,311
like I think it says 13,000 some odd files that is just renamed,

379
00:25:58,471 --> 00:26:00,133
which is just lovely.

380
00:26:04,136 --> 00:26:06,718
And yeah, that was awesome that that happened.

381
00:26:06,758 --> 00:26:07,039
So now.

382
00:26:09,575 --> 00:26:11,996
Now what we're doing here is I'm going to render, show you

383
00:26:12,016 --> 00:26:13,037
the rendering process.

384
00:26:13,637 --> 00:26:15,218
And we use this same information,

385
00:26:15,258 --> 00:26:17,440
but to build a folder structure, because you

386
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,600
can do that in Reaper.

387
00:26:19,101 --> 00:26:23,804
And I'm using those same parameters to, when it renders,

388
00:26:23,824 --> 00:26:26,665
it's going to put everything into a separate folder based

389
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:31,228
on item, surface, action, and then the final place,

390
00:26:31,909 --> 00:26:32,709
the final, final name.

391
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:39,313
And the reason for this is that structure

392
00:26:39,814 --> 00:26:43,196
matches how we have things set up in Wwise.

393
00:26:43,757 --> 00:26:47,680
Wwise is set up to expect that structure.

394
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,901
And I'm going to show you this process.

395
00:26:51,222 --> 00:26:52,263
So the reason why we're putting it

396
00:26:52,283 --> 00:26:55,526
into all these separate folders is to match the Wwise container

397
00:26:55,546 --> 00:26:55,906
structure.

398
00:27:02,758 --> 00:27:04,458
So now, the rendered files.

399
00:27:04,578 --> 00:27:06,559
This is the result of that rendering we did.

400
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:08,680
And there's all the folders of all the different items.

401
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,621
And there's a whole whack of them.

402
00:27:14,321 --> 00:27:21,184
And within each of these folders is all of the various surfaces

403
00:27:21,304 --> 00:27:23,464
for that item.

404
00:27:24,025 --> 00:27:25,585
In this case, it's the box grader.

405
00:27:25,725 --> 00:27:28,306
And then it's the benchtop surface.

406
00:27:28,406 --> 00:27:30,066
And these are the pickups.

407
00:27:31,993 --> 00:27:38,419
The other thing about these sounds is not only were they

408
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,442
the sound of things being moved around,

409
00:27:40,542 --> 00:27:43,305
but they were also like a UI sound for the player.

410
00:27:49,971 --> 00:27:52,234
And we exaggerated the pickup sounds.

411
00:27:53,447 --> 00:27:56,310
I mean, it's a little bit unnatural to always grab

412
00:27:56,370 --> 00:28:00,533
and slide something, but we needed that feedback

413
00:28:00,573 --> 00:28:01,514
that you picked up something.

414
00:28:01,954 --> 00:28:03,716
And you'll notice the edits are super tight.

415
00:28:04,256 --> 00:28:06,037
There's no time wasted in these sounds.

416
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,559
But you've got to remember in unpacking,

417
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,781
the pickup animation is one frame.

418
00:28:10,941 --> 00:28:13,023
It goes from unpicked up to picked up.

419
00:28:13,563 --> 00:28:17,006
And so having a sound that had a really nice, slow sound

420
00:28:17,066 --> 00:28:20,749
just felt laggy and slow, and it wasn't a good feeling.

421
00:28:20,789 --> 00:28:22,411
So we kept everything really tight so it was

422
00:28:22,932 --> 00:28:24,689
responsive and tactile.

423
00:28:25,752 --> 00:28:28,514
So going through this process, we were learning stuff as we went.

424
00:28:29,514 --> 00:28:31,915
A lot of items sounded similar.

425
00:28:32,736 --> 00:28:35,657
So we started recording generic materials

426
00:28:35,777 --> 00:28:38,559
to share amongst things, amongst items.

427
00:28:38,719 --> 00:28:43,021
So that's like, rather than recording a toothbrush,

428
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:45,662
we would record something we would call plastic light.

429
00:28:46,142 --> 00:28:48,743
And so anything that was light and made out of plastic

430
00:28:48,764 --> 00:28:50,284
would use plastic light.

431
00:28:50,464 --> 00:28:53,626
And we had glass, and we had ceramic, and et cetera.

432
00:28:56,718 --> 00:29:03,760
The, this is always interesting, but when two materials hit each other, the softest

433
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:11,562
material wins what were the predominant sound. So an example of this is you have a metal cup

434
00:29:12,122 --> 00:29:16,603
and a wooden cup and a hard table. You put the metal cup on, you'll hear the metallic sound.

435
00:29:17,363 --> 00:29:18,625
put the wooden cup on the wooden thing,

436
00:29:18,685 --> 00:29:19,745
you'll hear a wooden sound.

437
00:29:20,266 --> 00:29:23,829
If you take those two objects and put them on a bed,

438
00:29:23,849 --> 00:29:27,072
and put each one on a bed, they will sound identical.

439
00:29:27,592 --> 00:29:30,054
So that means I don't need to record those two things

440
00:29:30,334 --> 00:29:32,876
on bed, I just need a generic thing called

441
00:29:33,097 --> 00:29:34,378
object light on bed.

442
00:29:35,018 --> 00:29:37,240
So that worked on anything that was soft,

443
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,762
and it was that revelation that was also

444
00:29:39,822 --> 00:29:43,105
another huge time saver, that and the sort

445
00:29:43,125 --> 00:29:44,266
of shared materials.

446
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:50,745
Items that had a lot of character we would deem as a hero item and actually record that

447
00:29:50,825 --> 00:29:54,867
on all the different surfaces because they were special, like a ukulele or something

448
00:29:54,887 --> 00:29:55,188
like that.

449
00:29:56,537 --> 00:29:58,399
we recorded a library of sweeteners.

450
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:03,303
So, for example, we have this cup sound,

451
00:30:03,423 --> 00:30:06,485
but we also have this other cup that's got pencils in it,

452
00:30:06,725 --> 00:30:08,647
and they shake around when you move it.

453
00:30:08,707 --> 00:30:12,590
So we just recorded the sweetener of pencils shaking around

454
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:16,013
and played that while using the shared cup sound.

455
00:30:16,533 --> 00:30:18,735
So we had this library of sweeteners

456
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:21,037
that didn't need to be recorded on different surfaces

457
00:30:21,057 --> 00:30:22,738
because it's more about the sound of the...

458
00:30:23,499 --> 00:30:24,982
objects interacting with each other.

459
00:30:25,803 --> 00:30:30,352
And so the sweeteners actually gave us more mileage with all of our

460
00:30:30,933 --> 00:30:31,695
generic sounds.

461
00:30:33,262 --> 00:30:35,503
And also we realized that shaking things is fun.

462
00:30:37,244 --> 00:30:42,547
And so we made a dynamic shake system, which was akin to,

463
00:30:43,187 --> 00:30:46,389
you know, composers have percussion libraries and drums

464
00:30:46,429 --> 00:30:49,530
and stuff, and shakers with velocity switching.

465
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:52,572
That's so if you play a note quietly, it's a soft shake.

466
00:30:52,972 --> 00:30:54,773
And you play it hard, it's like a hard shake.

467
00:30:55,173 --> 00:30:58,214
Well, we set up that exact same system in Wwise.

468
00:30:58,975 --> 00:31:03,482
And Tim, our coder, detected the movement of the mouse.

469
00:31:03,922 --> 00:31:06,947
And the faster you did it, the louder it would get.

470
00:31:07,267 --> 00:31:08,689
And it would detect left and right.

471
00:31:08,769 --> 00:31:10,712
And so this is what that is like.

472
00:31:34,179 --> 00:31:38,501
OK, so I'm going slower than I did in my practice.

473
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:39,962
So I'm going to speed through the next bit.

474
00:31:42,504 --> 00:31:45,186
Importing into Wwise, this was our process.

475
00:31:48,098 --> 00:31:51,539
We would set up the switches, in this case, the action switch,

476
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,439
which was pick up or place.

477
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,460
Those are the two actions.

478
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,460
And we'd set up a surface switch of all the surfaces.

479
00:31:59,361 --> 00:32:01,781
Then I had a template that was going

480
00:32:01,801 --> 00:32:04,262
to be used by all of the items.

481
00:32:04,882 --> 00:32:06,202
This was pre-set up.

482
00:32:06,762 --> 00:32:08,503
There's all of our surfaces.

483
00:32:08,563 --> 00:32:11,764
And you can see that matches our folder structure

484
00:32:11,844 --> 00:32:13,004
that we did when we rendered.

485
00:32:19,223 --> 00:32:25,829
And the switches get set in code when the event triggers.

486
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:31,254
So Unity's driving which one of these to choose based on that.

487
00:32:31,654 --> 00:32:35,038
So it says, play shoe heavy, on surface equals shelf,

488
00:32:35,298 --> 00:32:36,319
action equals pick up.

489
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:39,301
And that's how simply that worked.

490
00:32:45,989 --> 00:32:51,714
So this is the actual importing process of me going to where,

491
00:32:51,794 --> 00:32:52,475
what am I doing here?

492
00:32:52,535 --> 00:32:55,998
Yeah, choosing the folders that I want to import.

493
00:32:56,038 --> 00:32:58,180
Here's all the folders we rendered earlier.

494
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:01,143
This is the way it looks in Wwise.

495
00:33:01,383 --> 00:33:02,344
You select all of these.

496
00:33:03,625 --> 00:33:06,628
folders and set it to the template that I just showed you.

497
00:33:07,148 --> 00:33:10,131
Wwise lights things up yellow that match.

498
00:33:10,231 --> 00:33:12,432
You can see our folder structure now is

499
00:33:12,513 --> 00:33:14,995
matching the container structure,

500
00:33:15,295 --> 00:33:17,557
and so it's going to build all of

501
00:33:17,597 --> 00:33:22,301
these containers in this configuration.

502
00:33:22,381 --> 00:33:25,664
The action containers will be filled with the WAV files.

503
00:33:29,587 --> 00:33:31,388
Life is a progress bar, isn't it?

504
00:33:33,431 --> 00:33:34,171
sign of the times.

505
00:33:38,752 --> 00:33:41,753
Okay, and as you can see now Wwise has a whole whack

506
00:33:42,093 --> 00:33:45,533
of containers in it that are all set up with the correct

507
00:33:46,173 --> 00:33:51,734
surface set to the correct switch. And everything's named the same so

508
00:33:51,774 --> 00:33:54,335
it's really easy to understand what goes into what.

509
00:33:54,655 --> 00:33:59,156
And you'll notice that not all sounds are set up on all surfaces.

510
00:33:59,736 --> 00:34:02,578
because on those other surfaces, they

511
00:34:02,598 --> 00:34:05,901
can use these shared generic objects.

512
00:34:06,662 --> 00:34:07,643
That's what those are there.

513
00:34:08,163 --> 00:34:12,006
So those are on the softer surfaces, the bed, the carpet.

514
00:34:12,487 --> 00:34:14,368
I think actually box and linoleum

515
00:34:14,388 --> 00:34:16,690
were the other ones that were considered soft as well,

516
00:34:17,531 --> 00:34:18,132
interestingly.

517
00:34:20,033 --> 00:34:22,315
And that's all full of the WAVE files.

518
00:34:26,551 --> 00:34:31,793
And now, the spreadsheet to track this thing was massive.

519
00:34:32,474 --> 00:34:35,315
And I'll show you just a quick thing here.

520
00:34:37,976 --> 00:34:39,577
This is it evolving over time.

521
00:34:39,597 --> 00:34:46,040
Yeah, we didn't really know what was going to happen here.

522
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:49,702
We were making it up as we go.

523
00:34:56,234 --> 00:34:59,015
We didn't have really a hard deadline initially.

524
00:34:59,495 --> 00:35:02,076
So we took our time and it just evolved over time.

525
00:35:02,096 --> 00:35:03,557
It was trial and error.

526
00:35:04,277 --> 00:35:09,339
And it did get pretty crazy big in the end.

527
00:35:09,579 --> 00:35:12,220
And lucky for me, it was actually Angela

528
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,920
that managed most of this.

529
00:35:14,741 --> 00:35:17,041
And she is much better at it than I am.

530
00:35:17,541 --> 00:35:19,502
Although I get into like all the formulas

531
00:35:19,562 --> 00:35:20,342
and stuff like that.

532
00:35:20,883 --> 00:35:23,223
But you can see how big this spreadsheet is.

533
00:35:23,243 --> 00:35:24,744
It's just ridiculous.

534
00:35:26,005 --> 00:35:35,993
And it's organized by the different rooms and the different items and all the different surfaces.

535
00:35:37,814 --> 00:35:44,900
This data is ultimately what got sent to Unity to trigger these sounds.

536
00:35:46,421 --> 00:35:50,264
I'm going to show a bit more detail here, I think, in my video.

537
00:35:51,125 --> 00:35:52,226
I've just gone a bit ahead of it.

538
00:35:54,253 --> 00:36:02,240
Yeah, so in the room column, that's obviously the room that this item is where it spawns.

539
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:07,225
The item name is the actual physical item from the game, and that drove everything.

540
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:16,053
Audio ID 1 is the sound event in Wwise that will get triggered on hard surfaces.

541
00:36:18,175 --> 00:36:22,178
But we also wanted a generic one for the soft surfaces.

542
00:36:22,219 --> 00:36:25,761
So we needed to basically assign each item two different IDs.

543
00:36:26,202 --> 00:36:30,005
This is also where we set up the sweeteners.

544
00:36:35,517 --> 00:36:38,741
And then the next thing I'm going to show is the surfaces.

545
00:36:38,801 --> 00:36:41,764
Now these columns were built with...

546
00:36:42,305 --> 00:36:44,707
This is the data that was sent to Unity.

547
00:36:45,648 --> 00:36:48,792
And these columns were built by Formula,

548
00:36:49,192 --> 00:36:53,257
which just simply appended the audio ID with the surface.

549
00:36:54,651 --> 00:36:58,457
Bed box, carpet liner, we're always ID 2 because that was the soft surfaces.

550
00:36:59,098 --> 00:37:02,583
And the highlighted cells you see are overrides where we've decided,

551
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:06,169
no, we don't want to use the thing we recorded, we want to use something different.

552
00:37:07,254 --> 00:37:09,315
because of reasons.

553
00:37:10,036 --> 00:37:14,979
Basically, sometimes the actual thing you recorded

554
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:18,021
just doesn't sound right, and you

555
00:37:18,041 --> 00:37:22,763
have to make a creative decision and choose something

556
00:37:22,803 --> 00:37:25,345
from a different surface to replace it.

557
00:37:26,906 --> 00:37:30,588
And this was a really cool little process here.

558
00:37:31,589 --> 00:37:34,110
This is the, so what I'm doing here

559
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:35,831
is I'm making a little change to show you

560
00:37:35,891 --> 00:37:38,232
how we would import this data into Unity.

561
00:37:38,573 --> 00:37:41,394
So I'm just copying this and replacing this audio ID.

562
00:37:41,895 --> 00:37:45,437
You can see the columns changing with that change.

563
00:37:46,357 --> 00:37:48,018
Now I'm switching over to Unity and I'm,

564
00:37:52,121 --> 00:37:55,665
importing this data by downloading the CSV,

565
00:37:55,805 --> 00:37:58,528
and Tim made it so it would actually

566
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:01,191
download the CSV directly from Google Sheets, which

567
00:38:01,251 --> 00:38:02,112
I thought was amazing.

568
00:38:02,733 --> 00:38:04,996
Straight into Unity, I click Update,

569
00:38:05,156 --> 00:38:07,479
and that change that I've done is now live in the game,

570
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:09,781
and it could be updated while the game was running.

571
00:38:11,997 --> 00:38:13,039
which was awesome.

572
00:38:14,941 --> 00:38:16,723
And the benefit of having something like Sheets

573
00:38:17,184 --> 00:38:19,146
in that situation with all that data

574
00:38:19,267 --> 00:38:23,071
is that obviously a spreadsheet gives you filtering, sorting,

575
00:38:23,512 --> 00:38:25,514
highlighting, formulas, and stuff.

576
00:38:25,534 --> 00:38:27,537
And it saves a lot of time when you're

577
00:38:27,617 --> 00:38:29,059
managing that much data.

578
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:34,951
And then the final piece of the puzzle

579
00:38:35,011 --> 00:38:38,352
was that we would audit our data and make sure

580
00:38:38,512 --> 00:38:40,092
that it's all correct.

581
00:38:40,852 --> 00:38:44,133
And so this is the audio audit tool that Tim made.

582
00:38:44,933 --> 00:38:48,814
And what this is doing is just this particular tab

583
00:38:48,874 --> 00:38:51,675
is validating the data in our spreadsheet

584
00:38:51,975 --> 00:38:53,935
to make sure everything is set up correctly.

585
00:38:54,335 --> 00:38:57,176
And it's telling us which, in this case,

586
00:38:57,516 --> 00:39:00,297
the mouseover is telling us which room a.

587
00:39:02,477 --> 00:39:09,340
a item is in, and it was also confirming whether it was correct or overridden.

588
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:16,383
And the unused ones are ones that are not necessary for the game. If data was missing,

589
00:39:16,423 --> 00:39:20,044
it would show up in this list. Luckily, nothing is missing because the game is shipped and I

590
00:39:20,084 --> 00:39:24,946
couldn't do anything about it now. And this other tab, the Foley scan,

591
00:39:25,106 --> 00:39:27,187
validates the location of all the WAV files.

592
00:39:29,179 --> 00:39:35,602
And it also shows me which audio IDs are mapped to which items.

593
00:39:36,302 --> 00:39:39,064
And so there was just a lot of checks and balances

594
00:39:39,084 --> 00:39:39,804
that this gave us.

595
00:39:41,005 --> 00:39:44,527
And in some ways, well, we had this tool, this audit tool,

596
00:39:44,887 --> 00:39:46,648
before we did the last recording.

597
00:39:47,048 --> 00:39:50,350
So it actually helped us prepare our recording scripts

598
00:39:50,811 --> 00:39:53,492
that we used, because it would say, yeah,

599
00:39:54,012 --> 00:39:55,353
you need to record this, but you don't

600
00:39:55,373 --> 00:39:56,734
need to record this, which was.

601
00:39:57,334 --> 00:39:59,356
really, really handy.

602
00:40:01,538 --> 00:40:05,022
So now I'm going into the end summary.

603
00:40:07,524 --> 00:40:08,906
Actually, how's my time?

604
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:10,267
We're good?

605
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:13,070
OK.

606
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:16,754
So we recorded a huge amount of sounds.

607
00:40:20,058 --> 00:40:24,682
We found some shortcuts along the way with those soft surfaces and generics.

608
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:29,825
Reaper and Wwise workflows were flexible and they kept us sane.

609
00:40:31,746 --> 00:40:36,549
Validation and Unity provided clarity in the chaos of all of this.

610
00:40:40,044 --> 00:40:41,965
And working with my family was really fun.

611
00:40:42,445 --> 00:40:44,087
And actually, I want to take this opportunity

612
00:40:44,907 --> 00:40:47,109
to share something with them, because they couldn't be here

613
00:40:49,091 --> 00:40:50,072
last night and today.

614
00:40:50,152 --> 00:40:51,793
But it was really cool.

615
00:40:51,833 --> 00:40:52,594
We won.

616
00:40:53,354 --> 00:40:55,656
I'd like to just congratulate Angela and Ella

617
00:40:55,736 --> 00:41:00,940
for winning the GDCA Best Audio Award for Unpacking, which

618
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,081
is really cool.

619
00:41:02,942 --> 00:41:05,003
So good on them.

620
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:07,105
It's pretty cool.

621
00:41:11,375 --> 00:41:12,136
Thing's really heavy.

622
00:41:13,936 --> 00:41:14,496
Satisfying.

623
00:41:15,517 --> 00:41:17,637
Yeah, it's interesting.

624
00:41:17,657 --> 00:41:19,618
I've worked with Ang since we've been married

625
00:41:19,698 --> 00:41:23,599
and we've worked together and we're still married

626
00:41:24,039 --> 00:41:25,940
and still like each other.

627
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,461
It's incredible.

628
00:41:28,321 --> 00:41:29,221
Actually, out of curiosity,

629
00:41:29,261 --> 00:41:30,902
does anybody here work with their family?

630
00:41:30,962 --> 00:41:33,963
Like, is there any family businesses or got a few people?

631
00:41:34,503 --> 00:41:35,903
It works well, it's all good.

632
00:41:37,855 --> 00:41:40,717
Yeah, it can be challenging, but I think it's really nice.

633
00:41:41,557 --> 00:41:45,178
I work with a few family devs, and yeah, it's really cool.

634
00:41:47,419 --> 00:41:50,100
And also in summary, you folks are awesome

635
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,161
for sitting here and listening to me geek out.

636
00:41:52,902 --> 00:41:53,802
Much appreciated.

637
00:41:54,983 --> 00:41:55,543
Thank you very much.

638
00:42:08,054 --> 00:42:16,026
And I think this is the time where I would ask if anybody has any questions to ask about anything that needs clarification or anything.

639
00:42:17,728 --> 00:42:18,088
Hey, Woody.

640
00:42:20,051 --> 00:42:20,292
Hello.

641
00:42:20,312 --> 00:42:22,715
Hi. Yeah, amazing job.

642
00:42:24,906 --> 00:42:25,546
I have a question.

643
00:42:25,566 --> 00:42:27,327
One of the first things that popped into my mind

644
00:42:27,387 --> 00:42:31,009
when I saw this project was, would this

645
00:42:31,069 --> 00:42:34,290
be a good use case for some kind of procedural audio,

646
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:35,771
physical modeling, synthesis?

647
00:42:35,951 --> 00:42:40,493
Which probably doesn't exist in the way that

648
00:42:40,593 --> 00:42:41,794
might work best for this.

649
00:42:41,854 --> 00:42:43,194
But is that something you considered?

650
00:42:43,214 --> 00:42:45,395
I did definitely consider that.

651
00:42:47,176 --> 00:42:47,897
We weren't sure.

652
00:42:47,917 --> 00:42:52,759
As an indie, we didn't have a huge budget.

653
00:42:53,786 --> 00:42:59,074
And that would have been, I would have liked to have maybe tried the Wwise, there's an impact thing in there.

654
00:42:59,194 --> 00:43:04,202
And I think I dabbled with it a little bit, but I think that could have worked.

655
00:43:04,222 --> 00:43:05,144
But.

656
00:43:07,954 --> 00:43:09,195
that just didn't seem to be...

657
00:43:10,055 --> 00:43:13,176
I don't know, I felt like the budget was part of a bit of an issue.

658
00:43:13,417 --> 00:43:17,818
The same reason why we didn't use the convolution reverb in Wwise in this,

659
00:43:17,878 --> 00:43:22,560
which since Unpacking has done pretty well,

660
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,942
we've actually added the convolution reverb now because we can afford it.

661
00:43:27,962 --> 00:43:31,163
But yeah, it was more of a budgetary thing that we didn't go down that path.

662
00:43:32,426 --> 00:43:32,606
Yeah.

663
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:33,727
Cool. Thank you.

664
00:43:33,767 --> 00:43:37,290
Yeah, I think in some ways this process matches the tone of the game.

665
00:43:38,191 --> 00:43:39,232
Yeah, maybe.

666
00:43:39,252 --> 00:43:41,554
It matches the organic nature of it or something.

667
00:43:41,594 --> 00:43:41,754
Yeah.

668
00:43:41,774 --> 00:43:42,214
I hear you.

669
00:43:42,254 --> 00:43:42,574
Thank you.

670
00:43:43,455 --> 00:43:43,715
Thanks.

671
00:43:45,136 --> 00:43:45,397
Hello.

672
00:43:46,017 --> 00:43:46,578
Hi.

673
00:43:47,618 --> 00:43:54,124
Were there any, while working on this, did you have any issues with file size of the game as the end product?

674
00:43:54,364 --> 00:43:56,526
No, file size. Yeah, that was really surprising.

675
00:43:58,262 --> 00:44:06,899
You know, I think all that data crunches into like 100 megs or 200 megs, I think, on the platform.

676
00:44:06,999 --> 00:44:09,363
And I think that's because Wwise is compressing it.

677
00:44:10,203 --> 00:44:11,964
Also, you've got to remember, you saw those edits.

678
00:44:11,984 --> 00:44:12,985
They are really short.

679
00:44:13,445 --> 00:44:14,706
There's very little.

680
00:44:14,846 --> 00:44:17,627
The longest things are obviously the music and stuff like that.

681
00:44:18,048 --> 00:44:22,230
But yeah, we didn't have any file size issues or even

682
00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:23,411
file count issues.

683
00:44:23,451 --> 00:44:25,212
I was kind of waiting for the whole thing to explode,

684
00:44:25,272 --> 00:44:27,433
but it seemed to keep it together.

685
00:44:27,533 --> 00:44:28,754
So yeah, no issues with that.

686
00:44:28,774 --> 00:44:29,835
All right, thanks.

687
00:44:30,355 --> 00:44:30,595
Welcome.

688
00:44:32,839 --> 00:44:35,040
Thank you much for the talk. I have a question about

689
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:40,722
while recording so many different sounds and varieties to this probably some of them are metallic and

690
00:44:40,782 --> 00:44:44,344
Certain surfaces would produce a lot of like unpleasant frequencies and things like that

691
00:44:44,804 --> 00:44:50,727
Did you organize it in a group with DSS compressors and like EQs or you take care of this sound individually?

692
00:44:51,067 --> 00:44:55,148
Just because there's so many of them. Yes groups might not be as good just because

693
00:44:55,288 --> 00:44:59,070
Yeah, you know what, I don't know if you noticed, I didn't really show it that clearly, but

694
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:06,292
in the Wwise project of the master foley file, we had a bunch of automation at the top,

695
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:14,154
and we had a bunch of plugins on the master bus, and we would just automate over certain items,

696
00:45:14,194 --> 00:45:18,456
we would turn on something with a plugin called, I think it's called Soothe.

697
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:20,581
I don't know if you've heard of this plugin called Soothe.

698
00:45:20,661 --> 00:45:24,864
I highly recommend it if you work with anything that's transient.

699
00:45:25,224 --> 00:45:27,986
It's really good at smoothing things out that are harsh.

700
00:45:28,566 --> 00:45:29,887
And yeah, so we did do that.

701
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:31,788
We did some limiting.

702
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:35,311
We did some EQ, a lot of high-pass filters,

703
00:45:35,331 --> 00:45:37,652
because we're recording things that are so quiet.

704
00:45:37,672 --> 00:45:41,074
We had that proximity effect where you're recording something.

705
00:45:41,114 --> 00:45:43,116
It's this tiny little thing, but because you

706
00:45:43,136 --> 00:45:46,058
have the mic so close, you get this huge amount of bottom end

707
00:45:46,138 --> 00:45:46,978
coming from the sound.

708
00:45:47,559 --> 00:45:50,119
which is unnatural, but if you high pass it, that works.

709
00:45:50,179 --> 00:45:52,040
So yes, we did all that sort of stuff,

710
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:55,021
but in very large sort of chunks of it,

711
00:45:55,121 --> 00:45:57,322
because rather than per item,

712
00:45:57,502 --> 00:46:01,283
there was very little per item, per sample processing

713
00:46:01,323 --> 00:46:01,703
going on.

714
00:46:01,743 --> 00:46:05,224
It was always big brush strokes of stuff.

715
00:46:05,384 --> 00:46:06,225
Just one quick question.

716
00:46:06,245 --> 00:46:09,406
What's your essential mic setup you recommend for like?

717
00:46:09,866 --> 00:46:10,526
Essential what, sorry?

718
00:46:11,066 --> 00:46:11,847
Oh, microphone setup.

719
00:46:12,235 --> 00:46:13,237
Oh, the microphone setup, yes.

720
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:15,379
The best, the mic that we used for everything

721
00:46:15,399 --> 00:46:19,545
was a Sennheiser MKH 8040.

722
00:46:20,165 --> 00:46:21,327
It's a beautiful little mic.

723
00:46:21,567 --> 00:46:23,229
I think it records up to 50 kilohertz.

724
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:25,432
So it's really a beautiful microphone,

725
00:46:25,472 --> 00:46:26,273
highly recommend it.

726
00:46:26,714 --> 00:46:28,516
And that gave us all those beautiful sounds.

727
00:46:28,976 --> 00:46:29,677
Okay, thank you so much.

728
00:46:29,918 --> 00:46:30,138
Thank you.

729
00:46:32,243 --> 00:46:39,267
Great talks, thanks. I was wondering, at the end of the project, a lot of things were very automated.

730
00:46:39,887 --> 00:46:44,089
And how was your process about automation coming by?

731
00:46:44,169 --> 00:46:48,692
Did you know since the beginning you were going to need tools and develop them?

732
00:46:49,332 --> 00:46:54,255
Or did you try to fumble doing things manually and then discover that you would need tools?

733
00:46:54,335 --> 00:46:58,837
And when did you choose to say, hey, actually, let's invest in tools?

734
00:46:59,192 --> 00:47:07,063
You know, I think I learned about this stuff at a thing called Gcap.

735
00:47:08,445 --> 00:47:10,167
It's a show like this, but it's in Australia.

736
00:47:11,129 --> 00:47:13,011
And this person, Gwen...

737
00:47:13,887 --> 00:47:15,609
Gwen Go, I think her last name is.

738
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:19,893
She did a little talk on her process with Wwise.

739
00:47:21,355 --> 00:47:24,338
And hers was a little different than what I've done,

740
00:47:24,438 --> 00:47:26,660
but what I discovered watching her talk

741
00:47:27,421 --> 00:47:32,787
is that Wwise had these automated processes.

742
00:47:33,467 --> 00:47:35,189
This is, the one I showed you is the one I chose,

743
00:47:35,229 --> 00:47:35,930
which is like...

744
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:39,291
taking folders and mapping it to containers.

745
00:47:39,432 --> 00:47:42,753
Her process is you configure all this stuff

746
00:47:42,773 --> 00:47:46,815
with a spreadsheet, and you feed the spreadsheet into Wwise,

747
00:47:47,355 --> 00:47:50,336
and the spreadsheet tells Wwise where all the files are.

748
00:47:51,036 --> 00:47:53,297
And they're both valid ways to do it.

749
00:47:54,918 --> 00:47:58,019
And for whatever reason, I chose the way we did.

750
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:01,821
So yeah, I learned this partially

751
00:48:01,841 --> 00:48:05,302
from going to another talk, like you guys have done.

752
00:48:05,362 --> 00:48:05,863
So yeah.

753
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:13,832
If I may just, my question was more like, because of that talk, did you know then since

754
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:17,656
the start of the project that you would need to put these tools in place?

755
00:48:17,776 --> 00:48:23,423
And I'm also thinking on the Unity tools that required programming and time investment.

756
00:48:23,723 --> 00:48:24,484
Yeah, I see what you mean.

757
00:48:26,847 --> 00:48:31,328
the, yeah, well, obviously I knew that this functionality existed.

758
00:48:31,428 --> 00:48:34,009
I knew right from the get-go that we were going to need that.

759
00:48:34,289 --> 00:48:39,290
The stuff that in Unity about those tools, that was, that came as we went

760
00:48:39,770 --> 00:48:43,511
and was developed as needed and as we got clarity.

761
00:48:43,711 --> 00:48:47,812
You know, so, yeah, this is one of those things where, you know, despite,

762
00:48:48,293 --> 00:48:51,153
you know, I've been doing this a long time, I'm still learning,

763
00:48:51,293 --> 00:48:53,414
you know, after all these years how to do this.

764
00:48:54,154 --> 00:48:55,977
And this is why I love this industry, actually.

765
00:48:56,078 --> 00:48:57,640
Exactly that, because I'm always learning.

766
00:48:58,121 --> 00:48:58,341
OK.

767
00:48:58,762 --> 00:48:59,223
Thanks a lot.

768
00:48:59,544 --> 00:48:59,804
Welcome.

769
00:49:03,412 --> 00:49:09,237
Hi Jeff, really loved everything you did with the game, been following it since like 2019,

770
00:49:09,297 --> 00:49:13,701
so it was really cool to see it come out and see everyone loving all the amazing work you put into it.

771
00:49:14,281 --> 00:49:14,681
Thank you.

772
00:49:15,322 --> 00:49:18,885
Honestly my question is, imagining there were a sequel or something to it,

773
00:49:20,086 --> 00:49:25,610
anything that you want to try for a theoretical next time around that you didn't get to try this way around,

774
00:49:26,091 --> 00:49:30,494
or things that you think that you would absolutely do differently if given the opportunity?

775
00:49:32,316 --> 00:49:37,000
Yeah, I would maybe, from a musical standpoint,

776
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:39,462
maybe something a little less linear

777
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:40,704
on the music side of things.

778
00:49:42,716 --> 00:49:49,119
And I'm not exactly sure what that is, but something to ease on the repetitiveness, you know.

779
00:49:50,659 --> 00:49:57,382
And then from a sound effect point of view, I do like the concept of the physical modeling of impacts.

780
00:49:57,422 --> 00:50:00,643
I think that maybe there was some room to explore that area.

781
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:12,470
And I think ultimately, I think from the process of recording, when Andrew and I got to the end of this and went,

782
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:17,296
you know, what would be awesome is if all of the surfaces were set up in a room.

783
00:50:18,317 --> 00:50:19,717
And Foley studios are like this.

784
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:21,958
This is why they exist, the proper ones.

785
00:50:22,018 --> 00:50:23,078
Ours was not a proper one.

786
00:50:23,178 --> 00:50:26,839
But all of the surfaces are set up.

787
00:50:26,899 --> 00:50:28,840
The mic is already set up on each one.

788
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:31,520
And you have all your items.

789
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:32,621
And you hit record.

790
00:50:32,701 --> 00:50:34,501
And you could probably just sequentially

791
00:50:34,561 --> 00:50:38,222
go through all the items on that surface and on this and this

792
00:50:38,822 --> 00:50:41,743
and just blast your way through all of the items

793
00:50:41,983 --> 00:50:43,924
and efficiently record everything

794
00:50:44,344 --> 00:50:46,564
in a very relatively short amount of time.

795
00:50:47,925 --> 00:50:49,726
kind of just doing more things in parallel,

796
00:50:49,786 --> 00:50:54,789
whereas, you know, she had to set up the surface,

797
00:50:55,069 --> 00:50:57,230
get all the items, do all the sounds,

798
00:50:57,610 --> 00:51:00,012
change the surface, change the miking,

799
00:51:00,032 --> 00:51:01,232
you know what I mean?

800
00:51:01,292 --> 00:51:02,573
So yeah, that would be another way

801
00:51:02,593 --> 00:51:04,454
I think we could have improved on the process.

802
00:51:04,634 --> 00:51:06,155
And if we did do a sequel,

803
00:51:06,195 --> 00:51:07,536
that's definitely what we would do.

804
00:51:08,136 --> 00:51:08,376
Awesome.

805
00:51:08,536 --> 00:51:10,217
Thank you so much for all the information.

806
00:51:10,237 --> 00:51:10,477
Super cool.

807
00:51:10,958 --> 00:51:11,178
Thanks.

808
00:51:12,539 --> 00:51:12,759
Hello.

809
00:51:12,779 --> 00:51:14,119
Hi.

810
00:51:14,219 --> 00:51:16,421
You mentioned that when using the Tascam DR4,

811
00:51:20,290 --> 00:51:26,915
I'm curious if there was a field recorder or audio interface that you thought had a better preamp for the kind of quiet sounds that you were recording.

812
00:51:27,495 --> 00:51:28,496
Sorry, say that last part again.

813
00:51:29,197 --> 00:51:33,660
What field recorders or audio interfaces would you recommend for recording those quiet sounds?

814
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:35,481
Oh, I see what you mean. Yeah.

815
00:51:35,722 --> 00:51:39,645
So what we ended up switching to instead of using that is I had a spare...

816
00:51:41,459 --> 00:51:47,386
What was the interface called? Steinberg USB, was it USB? No, it was FireWire.

817
00:51:48,207 --> 00:51:54,393
So it was kind of old. FireWire interface had really clean inputs and recorded up at 96 kilohertz.

818
00:51:55,555 --> 00:51:59,719
And that was attached to a Mac laptop with Reaper running on it.

819
00:52:01,321 --> 00:52:04,723
And look, maybe it's my particular TASCAM.

820
00:52:04,783 --> 00:52:05,903
I don't know if they're all like that.

821
00:52:05,943 --> 00:52:07,644
But my particular one, for whatever reason,

822
00:52:08,084 --> 00:52:09,785
was just really noisy on the input.

823
00:52:12,061 --> 00:52:15,222
just added another step to the process of getting rid of that noise.

824
00:52:15,282 --> 00:52:17,703
So I mean, for all I know, maybe it was a bad mic cable.

825
00:52:17,723 --> 00:52:19,404
I did try a couple of different things.

826
00:52:20,784 --> 00:52:24,346
But yeah, so in the end, our main recording process

827
00:52:24,426 --> 00:52:31,008
was using that Sennheiser 8040 mic into this Steinberg interface

828
00:52:31,568 --> 00:52:32,569
and straight into Reaper.

829
00:52:32,809 --> 00:52:34,690
So that worked out quite well.

830
00:52:35,550 --> 00:52:36,170
OK, thank you.

831
00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:36,690
Thank you.
