1
00:00:04,304 --> 00:00:06,426
So we all wear a lot of hats, right?

2
00:00:06,826 --> 00:00:08,247
That's a thing that we say.

3
00:00:08,267 --> 00:00:10,308
If you're an independent game developer,

4
00:00:10,388 --> 00:00:12,950
I feel like you're contractually obligated

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,451
to say it at least once.

6
00:00:15,252 --> 00:00:17,413
It is a truism in indie games, we have less,

7
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:21,376
so we need to do more, we wear a lot of hats.

8
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:24,578
I have worn a lot of hats, and they got heavy,

9
00:00:25,339 --> 00:00:26,700
and they hurt quite a bit.

10
00:00:28,213 --> 00:00:29,554
That's how I like to introduce myself.

11
00:00:29,814 --> 00:00:30,835
My name is John Remedios.

12
00:00:31,055 --> 00:00:33,137
I'm a game designer and developer from Toronto, Canada.

13
00:00:33,277 --> 00:00:36,259
I've been working in video games for just over nine years.

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,462
I went independent in 2015 when I found in my studio

15
00:00:40,063 --> 00:00:40,823
Actual Humans.

16
00:00:41,604 --> 00:00:44,066
The first game from Actual Humans

17
00:00:44,326 --> 00:00:45,387
is called Shoot Shoot Megapack.

18
00:00:45,467 --> 00:00:47,569
It is a modular, minimalist party game

19
00:00:47,669 --> 00:00:49,630
about rules, friendship, and shooting.

20
00:00:50,171 --> 00:00:52,293
Like I said, it is the only commercial game

21
00:00:52,353 --> 00:00:55,335
I've released independently, so surprise, surprise,

22
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:57,797
I goofed up a whole bunch.

23
00:00:59,522 --> 00:01:00,743
It went way over schedule.

24
00:01:00,903 --> 00:01:02,904
It did not hit its sales targets.

25
00:01:03,465 --> 00:01:05,066
It's not on all the platforms it should be.

26
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:08,208
The name is a bit of a hard sell,

27
00:01:08,948 --> 00:01:11,430
and it doesn't stand out.

28
00:01:14,652 --> 00:01:16,953
However, it did have its fair share of successes.

29
00:01:16,973 --> 00:01:18,994
It's a good animation.

30
00:01:19,014 --> 00:01:22,416
It met its design goals,

31
00:01:22,536 --> 00:01:25,698
like literally every single one that I set out to hit.

32
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:27,740
I built a number of

33
00:01:28,193 --> 00:01:32,916
professional and personal relationships because of this game, and I think it looks and feels

34
00:01:32,976 --> 00:01:33,417
quite nice.

35
00:01:34,157 --> 00:01:37,420
But most importantly to me, it found its audience.

36
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,481
So these are teens.

37
00:01:42,103 --> 00:01:43,765
In case you are unfamiliar.

38
00:01:45,246 --> 00:01:50,650
When I showed SSMP for the first time publicly in the Megabooth at PAX Prime 2015, before

39
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:56,754
it was even PAX West, these three fine folks came and played the demo literally every single

40
00:01:56,774 --> 00:01:57,755
day at least once.

41
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:01,628
And then they did it again when I showed in 2016.

42
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:06,272
And when the game was in the PAX 10 in 2017,

43
00:02:06,412 --> 00:02:07,873
even though we had already released.

44
00:02:09,354 --> 00:02:11,116
In 2018, I was just at PAX hanging out,

45
00:02:11,236 --> 00:02:13,398
and so we became buds.

46
00:02:16,401 --> 00:02:19,723
When I launched SSMP, they bought the game day one,

47
00:02:20,064 --> 00:02:22,346
put it on a laptop, and brought it to school,

48
00:02:22,646 --> 00:02:24,007
and played it with their friends over lunch.

49
00:02:24,347 --> 00:02:24,987
throughout the school year.

50
00:02:25,007 --> 00:02:25,868
They're all in college now.

51
00:02:25,968 --> 00:02:27,429
I don't know if they're still gonna do this

52
00:02:27,509 --> 00:02:28,830
with their fun college friends.

53
00:02:30,111 --> 00:02:32,273
Hopefully they will, but in my mind,

54
00:02:32,493 --> 00:02:34,634
this is what success looks like.

55
00:02:35,815 --> 00:02:39,898
However, the way I made SMP is not a story of success.

56
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,521
The game was not built sustainably,

57
00:02:43,781 --> 00:02:46,483
and by that I mean the mental and emotional costs

58
00:02:46,683 --> 00:02:48,104
of its development would not have been worth it,

59
00:02:48,305 --> 00:02:51,687
even if it had been some raging commercial success.

60
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:53,248
Realistically, I could.

61
00:02:53,985 --> 00:02:57,408
make one, maybe two more games the way that I made

62
00:02:57,588 --> 00:03:00,010
Choo Choo Mega Pack, and that is because

63
00:03:01,372 --> 00:03:02,753
I struggle with my mental health.

64
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:05,515
This is left intentionally blank because I could not find

65
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:06,956
an image that felt appropriate.

66
00:03:08,177 --> 00:03:09,338
I've struggled with my mental health

67
00:03:09,378 --> 00:03:10,399
for the majority of my life.

68
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,902
I don't always like to admit it or accept it,

69
00:03:15,203 --> 00:03:16,164
but it is something that I know.

70
00:03:16,184 --> 00:03:18,846
It is in my family history.

71
00:03:19,447 --> 00:03:22,389
I grew up in a household where it was prevalent,

72
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:22,990
to say the least.

73
00:03:23,679 --> 00:03:24,559
It is part of who I am.

74
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,241
I understand this now, and I understood it then.

75
00:03:29,521 --> 00:03:31,301
But when I started making Choo Choo Mega Pack,

76
00:03:32,122 --> 00:03:33,062
I actively ignored it.

77
00:03:34,722 --> 00:03:36,163
So today, I would like to talk to you

78
00:03:36,403 --> 00:03:40,264
about why I ignored it, what that resulted in,

79
00:03:41,064 --> 00:03:42,865
and how I'm trying to move past that.

80
00:03:43,665 --> 00:03:45,605
But before I do that, I do have a couple disclaimers.

81
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:48,746
Number one, I am not a mental health professional.

82
00:03:49,447 --> 00:03:51,267
I am a goof who makes video games.

83
00:03:51,707 --> 00:03:53,408
I can listen and empathize, or at least.

84
00:03:54,114 --> 00:03:55,795
try as hard as I can to do those things,

85
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:57,975
but I am not qualified to help anyone,

86
00:03:58,195 --> 00:04:00,696
so please do not take anything I say

87
00:04:00,836 --> 00:04:02,557
as an answer or a solution.

88
00:04:02,577 --> 00:04:04,197
I only have my own experience.

89
00:04:05,337 --> 00:04:08,138
And also, because we're in the failure workshop,

90
00:04:08,899 --> 00:04:11,419
I was a little bit apprehensive about having this talk

91
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:12,700
as part of the failure workshop

92
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,300
because I wanna make something explicitly clear.

93
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,501
Struggling with your mental health is not a failure.

94
00:04:17,521 --> 00:04:18,401
I am not saying that.

95
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:19,502
I would never say that.

96
00:04:19,702 --> 00:04:20,762
I think that is gross.

97
00:04:21,522 --> 00:04:22,323
I think that is harmful.

98
00:04:22,663 --> 00:04:23,223
So hopefully.

99
00:04:24,007 --> 00:04:25,668
We are all on the same page about that.

100
00:04:35,732 --> 00:04:36,032
Thank you.

101
00:04:36,072 --> 00:04:37,212
I do have a lot more slides though.

102
00:04:37,232 --> 00:04:42,194
Okay, so let's dig into why.

103
00:04:42,214 --> 00:04:46,155
So I started my first game job in 2009.

104
00:04:46,736 --> 00:04:50,197
I cut my teeth making casual games for a variety of studios across Toronto.

105
00:04:51,117 --> 00:04:52,498
I was launching games on things like

106
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,628
Big Fish and other casual digital download portals,

107
00:04:56,128 --> 00:04:58,109
Facebook and a lot of app store work,

108
00:04:58,189 --> 00:04:59,030
which is not surprising.

109
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:02,072
And I'm extremely grateful for this chunk of my career.

110
00:05:02,092 --> 00:05:04,394
I learned a lot, helped me pay off my student debt,

111
00:05:04,434 --> 00:05:06,935
which was huge, but that was not why

112
00:05:07,035 --> 00:05:08,496
I got into the industry, right?

113
00:05:08,536 --> 00:05:09,697
Ever since I started making games,

114
00:05:09,857 --> 00:05:10,838
I wanted to do one thing.

115
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:13,900
I wanted to make games the way I wanted to make them.

116
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,081
I wanted to make them independently.

117
00:05:15,601 --> 00:05:16,582
And the context of 2008, 2009

118
00:05:16,642 --> 00:05:17,823
really only bolstered that desire.

119
00:05:21,504 --> 00:05:23,686
This is definitely not news to most of you, I'm sure,

120
00:05:23,746 --> 00:05:26,869
but in case it is, here's a little quick refresher history lesson.

121
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:30,853
Things like digital distribution on consoles and early App Store,

122
00:05:31,714 --> 00:05:33,776
Flash game portals being a thing that existed,

123
00:05:34,037 --> 00:05:36,739
and Steam actually developing a user base

124
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,681
created this weird, perfect storm

125
00:05:38,962 --> 00:05:41,504
for a new generation of indie games to reach more people.

126
00:05:42,045 --> 00:05:44,668
And as the audience grew, we developed a narrative.

127
00:05:46,057 --> 00:05:49,177
We celebrated these games for being fresh, personal alternatives

128
00:05:49,277 --> 00:05:52,458
to the increasingly cold, corporate, quote-unquote,

129
00:05:52,578 --> 00:05:54,439
traditional game industry.

130
00:05:54,599 --> 00:05:57,279
And part of that celebration involved highlighting individuals,

131
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:00,740
often white dudes, as the sole creative forces responsible

132
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,680
for these passion projects.

133
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:06,001
And for some of us, myself included, this was a nice story to hear.

134
00:06:07,342 --> 00:06:08,242
I really latched onto it.

135
00:06:09,822 --> 00:06:10,623
This isn't surprising.

136
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:14,223
We have a long history of idolizing lone geniuses, often

137
00:06:14,761 --> 00:06:15,342
White dudes again.

138
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:18,685
We see it in our fiction, we see it in our businesses,

139
00:06:18,705 --> 00:06:20,546
we see it in our video games.

140
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,010
So when I was lucky enough to start making games

141
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:28,113
independently, this is really what I was aspiring to,

142
00:06:28,153 --> 00:06:29,735
whether or not I would admit it or not.

143
00:06:30,856 --> 00:06:33,498
But by mythologizing this image of the lone game developer

144
00:06:33,658 --> 00:06:35,820
and holding this ideal above everything else

145
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,822
is what I think is the core.

146
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,801
the core reason, or sorry, the core,

147
00:06:41,342 --> 00:06:45,264
mm-mm, the root cause of making choices

148
00:06:45,324 --> 00:06:48,286
that harmed not only myself, but others,

149
00:06:48,406 --> 00:06:52,029
and this isn't as important as those other two things,

150
00:06:52,109 --> 00:06:53,309
but also the game.

151
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:56,031
So that's a bit broad.

152
00:06:56,872 --> 00:06:57,832
So let's get out of the heavens

153
00:06:58,553 --> 00:07:00,234
and talk about what that looked like in practice.

154
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:02,755
So it looked a lot like this.

155
00:07:03,696 --> 00:07:06,298
Unsurprisingly, me wanting to do everything myself

156
00:07:06,578 --> 00:07:07,218
resulted in.

157
00:07:07,971 --> 00:07:09,933
an unwillingness to accept guidance from others,

158
00:07:10,274 --> 00:07:13,518
or the outright refusal of help when it was offered to me.

159
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:17,082
Which is ridiculous because a thing that I haven't mentioned

160
00:07:17,102 --> 00:07:19,245
is I didn't build SSMP on my own.

161
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:22,449
I worked with a group of really incredible people

162
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:24,932
who contributed a great deal to the game.

163
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:28,014
And I knew this about myself, and I knew this about

164
00:07:28,134 --> 00:07:29,595
the project when I was working on it.

165
00:07:29,795 --> 00:07:32,797
I was technically collaborating, but I didn't ever feel

166
00:07:33,098 --> 00:07:34,198
like I was collaborating with them,

167
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:36,360
because I was so entrenched in this idea

168
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,541
that it was my project, right?

169
00:07:38,741 --> 00:07:40,742
I was the one working full-time, I was the only one

170
00:07:40,822 --> 00:07:44,405
who could truly, fully understand the vision

171
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:46,126
for my triangle game.

172
00:07:46,146 --> 00:07:49,428
And so over the course of development,

173
00:07:49,528 --> 00:07:51,369
I went out of my way to reinforce this idea.

174
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:53,691
I isolated myself, I didn't leave my apartment

175
00:07:53,771 --> 00:07:55,091
for long stretches of time.

176
00:07:55,812 --> 00:08:00,074
I would organize the occasional workday here and there, but nothing really stuck.

177
00:08:01,335 --> 00:08:02,656
It was hard to justify to myself.

178
00:08:03,136 --> 00:08:04,016
I should be able to do this.

179
00:08:04,957 --> 00:08:05,897
I should be able to work from home.

180
00:08:08,579 --> 00:08:09,540
I also withdrew virtually.

181
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:14,923
I would quietly just work on things without telling anyone what I was doing or why it

182
00:08:14,963 --> 00:08:18,405
needed to get done, and then I would pop up and say, hey, here's all this stuff I've done,

183
00:08:18,645 --> 00:08:23,308
barfing out way more information than anyone needed, wanted, or could reasonably understand,

184
00:08:23,768 --> 00:08:24,728
which only made me feel...

185
00:08:25,323 --> 00:08:26,764
Like I could not be understood even more.

186
00:08:28,605 --> 00:08:32,787
But this isolating behavior extended past just my interactions, or more specifically

187
00:08:33,407 --> 00:08:35,168
my lack of interactions with other people.

188
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:36,529
It seeped into my process.

189
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:39,650
I became disdainful of production methods.

190
00:08:39,871 --> 00:08:40,931
It felt like a waste of time.

191
00:08:41,752 --> 00:08:42,512
I was making the game.

192
00:08:42,612 --> 00:08:44,433
I knew what I needed to do.

193
00:08:44,453 --> 00:08:50,076
I shouldn't need some arbitrary scheduler calendar to help me reach my goals.

194
00:08:51,217 --> 00:08:51,877
It was a lie.

195
00:08:52,057 --> 00:08:54,798
Obviously this is a ridiculous way to think about building video games.

196
00:08:55,524 --> 00:08:57,285
but is what I expected from myself.

197
00:08:58,225 --> 00:08:59,706
But it wasn't real, because in reality,

198
00:09:00,387 --> 00:09:02,448
the combination of these behaviors left me feeling alone,

199
00:09:03,089 --> 00:09:05,110
with no sense of direction, and I was ashamed,

200
00:09:05,971 --> 00:09:07,552
which made me withdraw even more,

201
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:09,573
which made that feeling stronger,

202
00:09:09,593 --> 00:09:13,696
until I didn't know where I was or what I was trying to do.

203
00:09:15,617 --> 00:09:17,839
So this was a cycle of shame and depression

204
00:09:17,979 --> 00:09:21,281
with moments of hyper-productivity that

205
00:09:22,913 --> 00:09:24,773
started really early on in development,

206
00:09:25,114 --> 00:09:27,814
way earlier than, as I was reflecting on it,

207
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:29,015
than I actually realized.

208
00:09:30,255 --> 00:09:32,096
And it continued throughout the development of the game

209
00:09:32,316 --> 00:09:33,716
and well past its launch.

210
00:09:33,936 --> 00:09:35,237
Some of the cycles were fairly short.

211
00:09:36,557 --> 00:09:37,758
They only lasted about a few days,

212
00:09:37,898 --> 00:09:41,659
and some of them went much longer than that.

213
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,861
At its worst, I was not eating, or bathing,

214
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:48,801
or brushing my teeth, or shaving.

215
00:09:50,008 --> 00:09:55,309
Some days, just getting from my bed to the couch was a good day.

216
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,170
I'd seen this in myself before, right?

217
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:58,770
I knew what this was.

218
00:09:59,651 --> 00:10:01,831
But I thought, this should be different, right?

219
00:10:02,172 --> 00:10:06,013
I should be different because I am doing the thing that I wanted to do.

220
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:08,513
I am doing the thing that I love.

221
00:10:09,554 --> 00:10:12,495
And the fact that it wasn't loving me back made me feel weak,

222
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:16,556
and it made me feel lazy, and it made me feel worthless.

223
00:10:18,379 --> 00:10:19,600
And I'm not saying that there's anything wrong

224
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,301
with aspiring to become something.

225
00:10:23,442 --> 00:10:27,844
But when you're too focused on the things that you lack,

226
00:10:28,025 --> 00:10:28,945
on the things that you are not,

227
00:10:29,665 --> 00:10:32,347
it becomes really easy to lose track of everything else.

228
00:10:33,568 --> 00:10:34,328
And that's what happened to me.

229
00:10:34,408 --> 00:10:35,809
And yeah, I shipped the game, sure.

230
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:37,950
But what about the next one?

231
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:40,211
Or the one after that, or the one after that?

232
00:10:40,412 --> 00:10:42,313
Like, how many times do I have to go through this

233
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:45,675
before I can't do it anymore,

234
00:10:45,715 --> 00:10:47,976
before it severely hurts me?

235
00:10:50,131 --> 00:10:50,451
I don't know.

236
00:10:51,811 --> 00:10:52,992
And I don't really want to find out.

237
00:10:54,352 --> 00:10:57,913
Which brings us to how I'm trying to move past this.

238
00:10:59,233 --> 00:11:03,434
I am trying to improve my process and my relationship with my work into something that is a little

239
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:03,954
bit healthier.

240
00:11:05,854 --> 00:11:08,455
This is not all-encompassing.

241
00:11:08,575 --> 00:11:11,235
This is a very small slice of the things that I'm doing.

242
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:15,596
Obviously this takes place within a much broader treatment plan for myself.

243
00:11:16,813 --> 00:11:18,474
Like I said, I'm not trying to give anyone advice,

244
00:11:18,574 --> 00:11:20,075
and I wanted to keep this fairly work-centric,

245
00:11:20,115 --> 00:11:21,976
so just please keep that in mind.

246
00:11:23,698 --> 00:11:26,000
So I've tried making a habit of asking for

247
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,581
and accepting help from others.

248
00:11:27,701 --> 00:11:29,502
It's not something that comes naturally to me,

249
00:11:29,742 --> 00:11:32,745
but building it into my life

250
00:11:33,265 --> 00:11:35,667
is something that I found quite beneficial.

251
00:11:36,367 --> 00:11:38,329
For example, I help organize just a small,

252
00:11:38,729 --> 00:11:39,930
peer group of game developers.

253
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:43,113
It's not mental health-focused, but we just get together,

254
00:11:43,173 --> 00:11:45,615
and we talk about stuff, both good and bad.

255
00:11:46,682 --> 00:11:49,384
And the point of it is, we're just trying to make space

256
00:11:49,404 --> 00:11:51,965
for one another, trying to make time for each other.

257
00:11:53,226 --> 00:11:54,727
I'm really just trying to say these things out loud.

258
00:11:56,408 --> 00:11:58,530
I've also been really conscious of my physical environment

259
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:59,711
and its impact on me.

260
00:12:00,331 --> 00:12:02,333
Keeping in line with asking others for help,

261
00:12:02,373 --> 00:12:03,633
I reached out to an old boss of mine

262
00:12:03,693 --> 00:12:05,335
who offered me a desk at a studio

263
00:12:05,395 --> 00:12:06,475
and I go there a few days a week,

264
00:12:07,136 --> 00:12:09,317
which is great if I need just a change of environment

265
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,479
or to be around other human beings.

266
00:12:13,088 --> 00:12:15,770
I also brought on collaborators for my next project

267
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:20,373
extremely early because I do not want it to be mine,

268
00:12:21,053 --> 00:12:22,114
I want it to be ours.

269
00:12:22,954 --> 00:12:24,455
I'm still guiding the project,

270
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,256
but the process is a lot more conversational.

271
00:12:26,617 --> 00:12:28,077
We give each other feedback constantly,

272
00:12:28,558 --> 00:12:30,999
and who has final say is really dependent on the context.

273
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,841
Obviously, it's way too early to say whether or not

274
00:12:32,881 --> 00:12:35,202
this is successful or will be successful,

275
00:12:35,302 --> 00:12:37,544
but I already think that the game is,

276
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:40,145
at least the process is markedly better for it.

277
00:12:42,085 --> 00:12:43,867
And finally, I've been trying to mend my relationship

278
00:12:43,907 --> 00:12:45,048
with production methodologies.

279
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:48,271
I have found something that is manageable,

280
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:51,834
relatively lightweight, and works for me.

281
00:12:51,954 --> 00:12:53,435
It's beyond the scope of this talk,

282
00:12:53,535 --> 00:12:56,358
but I'm hopefully gonna write something about that soon.

283
00:12:56,878 --> 00:12:58,700
The thing that's really important to keep in mind

284
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,422
if you are someone who is resentful of production,

285
00:13:01,562 --> 00:13:03,684
like, I don't know that it's that uncommon

286
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:08,508
for smaller indies, is that it doesn't necessarily need

287
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:09,969
to just be a thing that you're using to...

288
00:13:11,138 --> 00:13:16,783
make the game. It helps cut out ambiguity and anxiety and just give you a clearer picture

289
00:13:17,203 --> 00:13:22,848
when you're in the middle of development and who knows how you're ever going to make this

290
00:13:23,168 --> 00:13:31,195
goddamn thing. But I will say one of the things that my personal methodology does not have

291
00:13:31,455 --> 00:13:34,118
is Gantt charts, because they're the bad thing. They suck.

292
00:13:36,434 --> 00:13:38,016
So yeah, that's where I'm at today.

293
00:13:38,556 --> 00:13:40,958
I'm still working at it, I am chipping away at ideals

294
00:13:40,998 --> 00:13:43,400
that are doing me way more harm than good.

295
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,681
I'm a work in progress, right?

296
00:13:45,982 --> 00:13:47,603
I'm not better, I don't know what that means.

297
00:13:47,643 --> 00:13:50,805
This is something that I'm likely gonna have to deal with

298
00:13:50,845 --> 00:13:54,228
for my entire life, and that is okay.

299
00:13:55,989 --> 00:13:58,871
I don't have any answers about how to live like that,

300
00:13:58,972 --> 00:14:02,314
but in my experience, regardless of whether or not

301
00:14:02,334 --> 00:14:03,475
you're struggling with your mental health,

302
00:14:04,075 --> 00:14:05,296
it's always worth reflecting on.

303
00:14:05,752 --> 00:14:08,093
the things that you want, the things that you purport to want,

304
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:10,655
and seeing if it lines up with what you actually need.

305
00:14:11,575 --> 00:14:12,376
Because sometimes it doesn't.

306
00:14:13,116 --> 00:14:13,637
It didn't for me.

307
00:14:14,777 --> 00:14:16,759
And I'm saying that because I do not think

308
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:18,079
that I am particularly unique.

309
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:19,700
I have...

310
00:14:24,343 --> 00:14:25,904
I guess that doesn't really match the tone, huh?

311
00:14:27,905 --> 00:14:30,087
I have no doubt in my mind that there are other people

312
00:14:30,367 --> 00:14:32,528
either in this room or at this conference.

313
00:14:33,117 --> 00:14:35,277
in this industry that have gone through, are going through,

314
00:14:35,337 --> 00:14:37,778
or will go through something similar to what I described.

315
00:14:38,298 --> 00:14:39,638
Not the same, but it doesn't really matter.

316
00:14:41,179 --> 00:14:42,059
And if you are one of those people,

317
00:14:42,139 --> 00:14:44,620
I just wanted to say that I hope you feel seen.

318
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,420
You are why I wanted to give this talk.

319
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,281
I don't think the world needs more games

320
00:14:48,301 --> 00:14:49,601
about triangles and shooting,

321
00:14:50,061 --> 00:14:51,662
but I do think the industry needs your voices

322
00:14:51,942 --> 00:14:52,662
and your perspectives.

323
00:14:53,302 --> 00:14:55,563
And the thought of us not being able to hear them

324
00:14:55,643 --> 00:14:58,504
because you are trying to wear too many hats

325
00:14:58,564 --> 00:14:59,804
or you're trying to shove yourself into one

326
00:14:59,824 --> 00:15:01,484
that doesn't fit properly,

327
00:15:03,479 --> 00:15:04,200
I think that's heartbreaking.

328
00:15:05,561 --> 00:15:07,803
So I hope something I've said resonated with some of you

329
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:08,224
in some way.

330
00:15:08,264 --> 00:15:11,106
But please do not listen to me for most things.

331
00:15:11,727 --> 00:15:12,668
Here are some resources.

332
00:15:12,848 --> 00:15:14,210
It's very GDC-centric again.

333
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,572
Both Checkpoint and Take This have

334
00:15:17,273 --> 00:15:19,615
aggregated a lot of really great information

335
00:15:19,715 --> 00:15:21,837
for people who are either struggling with mental health

336
00:15:21,957 --> 00:15:23,358
or know other people who are struggling

337
00:15:23,378 --> 00:15:23,979
with their mental health.

338
00:15:24,386 --> 00:15:27,530
Also, there is an IGDA-led roundtable on Thursday

339
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:28,671
at 2 p.m. in the South Hall,

340
00:15:28,912 --> 00:15:30,574
if that is something you feel comfortable going to.

341
00:15:30,594 --> 00:15:33,517
I went to one last year and it was extremely cathartic.

342
00:15:33,877 --> 00:15:35,319
It was hard, but I enjoyed it.

343
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:37,221
Enjoy is not the right word.

344
00:15:39,224 --> 00:15:40,285
But that's not for everybody.

345
00:15:41,827 --> 00:15:42,828
Yeah, so that's it.

346
00:15:42,968 --> 00:15:43,890
Thank you so much for your time.

347
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,081
Thanks.

348
00:15:59,281 --> 00:16:01,143
There's my contact information if you want.

349
00:16:01,403 --> 00:16:01,784
Bye.

350
00:16:04,246 --> 00:16:04,867
My name is Juan.

351
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:08,330
I'm 26 years old and I'm the co-founder,

352
00:16:09,031 --> 00:16:10,953
creative director and business person

353
00:16:11,193 --> 00:16:13,435
at a small indie studio based in Spain.

354
00:16:13,455 --> 00:16:14,296
It's called Team Gotham.

355
00:16:15,437 --> 00:16:17,940
First of all, I want to say thank you for having me here.

356
00:16:19,544 --> 00:16:21,765
It's pretty much an honor for me.

357
00:16:22,225 --> 00:16:26,207
And second, I want to apologize if I made mistakes

358
00:16:26,267 --> 00:16:26,848
during my talk.

359
00:16:27,328 --> 00:16:28,809
English is not my first language,

360
00:16:29,449 --> 00:16:30,690
so I know I made mistakes.

361
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,591
So yeah, apologize for that.

362
00:16:34,892 --> 00:16:37,713
This talk is going to be at postmortem

363
00:16:38,374 --> 00:16:41,755
not only on our previous last game release,

364
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:45,597
but on the whole history of our company, Team Gotham.

365
00:16:46,485 --> 00:16:51,769
And it's going to be a story about making loads of mistakes that led us to make desperate

366
00:16:51,809 --> 00:16:59,016
decisions that led us to loads of anxiety and sleepless nights in the past few months.

367
00:17:00,116 --> 00:17:08,924
As this is pretty raw, still is pretty recent, I expect this talk, like me being here, to

368
00:17:08,964 --> 00:17:14,349
be kind of therapy to get some closure about all this.

369
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:21,431
recent events and also help, of course, others that may be in a similar situation, hopefully.

370
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:30,253
So the story begins when we founded the studio, Team Gotham, back in 2013.

371
00:17:30,873 --> 00:17:38,055
We were starting at university and we were making mobile games, prototypes, and we quickly

372
00:17:38,295 --> 00:17:42,397
jumped into PC development with a game called The Guest.

373
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,923
which is a first-person exploration game,

374
00:17:44,943 --> 00:17:46,605
a really humble, classic thing,

375
00:17:47,205 --> 00:17:50,128
somewhere between Gone Home and The Room,

376
00:17:50,948 --> 00:17:51,329
if you may.

377
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:55,012
And yeah, so did we know what we were doing back then?

378
00:17:55,712 --> 00:17:59,796
Kind of yes, because we knew how to do 3D modeling,

379
00:17:59,896 --> 00:18:01,497
we knew how to do programming,

380
00:18:01,697 --> 00:18:03,219
we knew basics on design,

381
00:18:03,339 --> 00:18:05,380
so development was covered,

382
00:18:05,461 --> 00:18:08,643
but hell no, like when we finished college,

383
00:18:10,726 --> 00:18:12,347
We didn't know anything about the industry.

384
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:15,328
We didn't know how to get the game noticed,

385
00:18:15,888 --> 00:18:20,089
and we were trying everything to make that happen.

386
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:22,490
We were trying to send out press releases,

387
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:24,851
going to events, pitch to publishers,

388
00:18:25,511 --> 00:18:28,012
all those things that weren't working at all.

389
00:18:28,632 --> 00:18:32,454
So we got into this sense of desperation,

390
00:18:32,734 --> 00:18:34,074
and we collapsed.

391
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,976
So we say, oh hey, a publisher might help us, right?

392
00:18:39,373 --> 00:18:43,355
people say a publisher can help, so that may be a good idea.

393
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:49,057
After all this process of desperation where we collapsed,

394
00:18:49,097 --> 00:18:52,559
we traveled to many events back in Europe,

395
00:18:53,439 --> 00:18:56,680
and we landed a publisher in a moment of huge desperation.

396
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,821
It was like the last resource we had.

397
00:18:59,881 --> 00:19:02,182
Because we didn't have real resources.

398
00:19:02,202 --> 00:19:04,043
We didn't have any money or savings.

399
00:19:04,323 --> 00:19:05,303
We were just students.

400
00:19:06,446 --> 00:19:11,950
So landing a publisher in this situation was a good thing and a bad thing.

401
00:19:13,671 --> 00:19:25,099
So being desperate is the feeling of showing a hopeless sense that a situation is so bad that it's impossible to deal with.

402
00:19:25,379 --> 00:19:29,101
And also a feeling of great need or desire for something.

403
00:19:29,682 --> 00:19:31,083
I would say that we had...

404
00:19:32,441 --> 00:19:36,004
mixed feeling between these two definitions of the word.

405
00:19:36,704 --> 00:19:43,210
And yeah, this whole situation led us to this desperate decision number one,

406
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:46,832
which was signing a good deal in short term with this publisher,

407
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,635
but it was bad in the long run for us.

408
00:19:51,536 --> 00:19:55,899
So again, we had no resources, we had nothing was working,

409
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,302
everything we were trying, and we were collapsed.

410
00:20:00,056 --> 00:20:03,298
at that time, so when we were negotiating with this publisher,

411
00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:06,060
we did a lot of things wrong.

412
00:20:06,641 --> 00:20:14,206
We budgeted wrong, and we rejected

413
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:18,409
to have any revenue share in the short term, which

414
00:20:18,469 --> 00:20:21,891
means they had 100% recoup policy, which

415
00:20:21,951 --> 00:20:26,534
means publishers have to recoup the investment.

416
00:20:28,564 --> 00:20:31,385
and only then you will see some profit of it.

417
00:20:32,405 --> 00:20:36,266
It was good in the short term because it was going to allow us

418
00:20:36,326 --> 00:20:41,447
to do things immediately and build a studio properly,

419
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:43,428
hire some people, stuff like that.

420
00:20:44,128 --> 00:20:48,849
But this feeling of being anxious about getting money,

421
00:20:49,129 --> 00:20:52,810
it wasn't greed, I would say, but we were students

422
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:55,390
and we wanted to build a thing properly.

423
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,271
So this anxious feeling...

424
00:20:59,014 --> 00:21:03,976
didn't allow us to sit back and relax and take a lot of things

425
00:21:04,336 --> 00:21:07,797
and ask people that were more experienced than us

426
00:21:07,877 --> 00:21:09,058
and just stop thinking.

427
00:21:09,538 --> 00:21:10,438
So we were anxious.

428
00:21:10,518 --> 00:21:13,559
We ran into the deal, and we signed the deal.

429
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:19,261
So three years from that, from releasing the game

430
00:21:19,641 --> 00:21:20,922
and 25,000 copies after launch, we've

431
00:21:20,982 --> 00:21:23,762
seen no money from this game yet.

432
00:21:23,903 --> 00:21:27,384
And it's not expecting to change any time soon.

433
00:21:27,404 --> 00:21:28,204
I mean, it's not like the game.

434
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,180
is a hit and will be rich or something,

435
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,601
but paying bills is also nice.

436
00:21:37,602 --> 00:21:39,502
But yeah, that's how we feel now,

437
00:21:39,562 --> 00:21:41,543
but back then was like, hey, who cares?

438
00:21:41,663 --> 00:21:43,983
Like a game didn't work out that well,

439
00:21:44,023 --> 00:21:45,644
but we have plenty of money in the bank,

440
00:21:46,184 --> 00:21:48,104
let's make a new game, whatever.

441
00:21:48,364 --> 00:21:53,545
So we wanted to overlap the ending

442
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,626
of the production of The Guest with the...

443
00:21:57,036 --> 00:22:00,157
with a new game, with a new pre-production of the game.

444
00:22:00,177 --> 00:22:02,018
And we asked ourselves, like,

445
00:22:02,118 --> 00:22:03,579
shouldn't we take a break before that?

446
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:06,561
I mean, we've been making this game for two years,

447
00:22:07,061 --> 00:22:11,323
and it should be nice to have a break

448
00:22:11,383 --> 00:22:14,985
and just stay away from things for some time.

449
00:22:15,566 --> 00:22:19,068
But at that time, money blinded us badly,

450
00:22:19,188 --> 00:22:22,770
and we were basically slaves of this money.

451
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:25,211
We were thinking time equals money.

452
00:22:25,994 --> 00:22:29,557
and vacation equals nonsense, which is absolutely wrong.

453
00:22:30,318 --> 00:22:34,521
And that had really bad consequences after that.

454
00:22:34,661 --> 00:22:37,564
But we didn't allow ourselves to stop at this point

455
00:22:37,584 --> 00:22:39,025
because money was running out.

456
00:22:39,865 --> 00:22:43,688
So we started the production of our last game,

457
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:47,572
it's called Solo, which is an introspective puzzle

458
00:22:47,612 --> 00:22:49,633
adventure about love relationships

459
00:22:49,893 --> 00:22:53,136
and how love affects our everyday life.

460
00:22:54,157 --> 00:22:54,257
And.

461
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,022
What happened six months into development?

462
00:22:58,763 --> 00:23:02,605
We spent $45,000 into a vertical slice,

463
00:23:02,665 --> 00:23:07,448
which was kind of like the half of the budget we have.

464
00:23:07,468 --> 00:23:09,429
And the game was absolute shit.

465
00:23:09,569 --> 00:23:10,530
Game was boring.

466
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:12,491
It's like doing homework.

467
00:23:14,052 --> 00:23:15,973
So wow, why did this happen?

468
00:23:16,213 --> 00:23:19,955
Because communication was inexistent.

469
00:23:19,975 --> 00:23:20,716
It was really poor.

470
00:23:21,622 --> 00:23:27,964
We were burned out. We never stopped to, as I say, sit back and think about things.

471
00:23:28,064 --> 00:23:35,967
We were continuously doing things with this anxious feeling of money's running out, money's running out.

472
00:23:36,087 --> 00:23:36,987
We have to do stuff.

473
00:23:39,408 --> 00:23:45,530
So yeah, I remember one day I came to the studio and I asked people like,

474
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:50,432
how do you feel about the game? And no one was happy about it.

475
00:23:51,018 --> 00:23:54,361
but we never talked about it before.

476
00:23:55,301 --> 00:23:58,924
So yeah, it was too late.

477
00:23:59,285 --> 00:24:00,566
We needed to shift directions now.

478
00:24:01,647 --> 00:24:06,411
New design, a new business plan, but money was running out,

479
00:24:06,591 --> 00:24:07,031
for real.

480
00:24:07,792 --> 00:24:10,074
We spent half of what we had.

481
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:13,056
There was no time at all.

482
00:24:14,397 --> 00:24:16,859
And we already pitched publishers,

483
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,261
and they, of course, rejected that.

484
00:24:20,133 --> 00:24:31,957
trash game we had. So this situation again, this action, anxious, sorry, situation of

485
00:24:32,117 --> 00:24:37,798
desperation of collapsing again, led us to the desperate decision number two, which was

486
00:24:37,858 --> 00:24:43,740
making a crowdfunding campaign. We were super scared about a crowdfunding campaign, but

487
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:46,361
we had no other option to get money as AIP.

488
00:24:47,537 --> 00:24:51,978
So we approached FIG, which is a crowdfunding, crowdinvestment platform,

489
00:24:52,619 --> 00:24:55,680
and they shared the vision of the game.

490
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,161
We were excited about it, so that was great.

491
00:24:59,701 --> 00:25:05,663
But we were still really, really afraid of doing a crowdfunding campaign,

492
00:25:05,703 --> 00:25:10,865
so we budgeted the campaign way below what we needed,

493
00:25:11,105 --> 00:25:13,306
because we were scared about not getting to the goal.

494
00:25:14,574 --> 00:25:18,257
That would let us almost no money left for marketing and PR actions.

495
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:25,723
One thing also is that during the campaign, in the middle of it, we got stuck.

496
00:25:26,304 --> 00:25:30,547
Like, money was not rising and the goal was approaching.

497
00:25:31,087 --> 00:25:33,890
So Fick came out with a kind of a solution.

498
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:36,812
He bring an investor, and guess what?

499
00:25:37,112 --> 00:25:39,494
Investor wanted 100% recoup policy again.

500
00:25:39,755 --> 00:25:42,877
So, one year after launch, again.

501
00:25:43,588 --> 00:25:45,728
We have seen no money from game sales,

502
00:25:46,648 --> 00:25:48,469
and it's not expected to change anytime soon.

503
00:25:50,509 --> 00:25:54,130
It's important to understand that we took these decisions

504
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:58,131
thinking that we're the best for the studio at that time,

505
00:25:59,111 --> 00:26:02,532
and that was the only options we had all the time.

506
00:26:04,232 --> 00:26:05,773
And well, it's not only that.

507
00:26:05,813 --> 00:26:08,473
It's not only about these deals, but it's also the gap.

508
00:26:08,933 --> 00:26:09,273
You never.

509
00:26:10,692 --> 00:26:11,913
You know the industry's bad.

510
00:26:12,213 --> 00:26:14,954
It's really hard to get your game on Steam, blah, blah, blah.

511
00:26:15,314 --> 00:26:17,995
But you never expect your game to be that bad.

512
00:26:19,076 --> 00:26:21,076
Press is talking great about your game,

513
00:26:21,156 --> 00:26:22,317
but no one's buying it.

514
00:26:23,977 --> 00:26:28,699
So that's also something that emotionally, it's on you.

515
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:33,721
So the thing is, the abusive 100% recoup deals

516
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:35,662
killed us in some way, and maybe killing

517
00:26:35,702 --> 00:26:37,383
other people, all the studios.

518
00:26:39,504 --> 00:26:42,146
We have no money in the bank left in the company account,

519
00:26:42,286 --> 00:26:44,628
so all the expenses are out of our pockets,

520
00:26:44,688 --> 00:26:46,329
like being here or going there.

521
00:26:47,309 --> 00:26:51,973
And the games we made wasn't huge hits,

522
00:26:52,333 --> 00:26:54,975
but still we'll be paying some bills, which is nice.

523
00:26:57,697 --> 00:27:01,739
I often ask myself if we would be at the same point

524
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:06,843
if that first desperate deal hadn't been that desperate.

525
00:27:07,486 --> 00:27:13,710
And honestly, I think yes, because this talk is not a rant on publishers or 100% recruit

526
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:15,171
deals, which I think they suck.

527
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:23,057
It's more a rant on us, talking out loud about all the stuff we made wrong, which is a bunch.

528
00:27:23,937 --> 00:27:29,481
Like I said, we budget things wrong, we scope things wrong, we didn't communicate, which

529
00:27:29,561 --> 00:27:32,903
is the most important thing that we...

530
00:27:33,498 --> 00:27:38,299
we didn't do, I think a good producer is not only the one who is delivering the game on time,

531
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:43,601
it's also the one who has like a human approach to the people,

532
00:27:44,501 --> 00:27:47,902
and a sensitive approach to the people who's working with,

533
00:27:47,922 --> 00:27:56,385
and before asking how's work, asking how do you feel, how's life, are you okay, all that things.

534
00:27:57,025 --> 00:27:59,586
And that's the lesson I learned and I'm trying to apply.

535
00:28:00,386 --> 00:28:02,226
in my everyday life, not only in games,

536
00:28:02,386 --> 00:28:04,187
but with friends and family.

537
00:28:05,187 --> 00:28:08,448
So I think no, life would be the same,

538
00:28:08,568 --> 00:28:10,869
because also we were making games

539
00:28:10,909 --> 00:28:12,389
that maybe no one wanted to buy.

540
00:28:12,729 --> 00:28:16,870
So it's good acknowledging that the desperate deals

541
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:19,131
are only like the turning points of the story,

542
00:28:19,411 --> 00:28:23,492
but our mistakes is what led us to those points.

543
00:28:25,552 --> 00:28:26,553
So right now,

544
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:32,102
We have made no money from game sales since 2013.

545
00:28:33,123 --> 00:28:36,765
We have made huge mistakes out of huge desperation

546
00:28:37,385 --> 00:28:41,347
that led us to sign bad deals for us.

547
00:28:42,027 --> 00:28:44,469
We lost one partner and one employee in the last year.

548
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:48,931
Now I doubt constantly of my capacities

549
00:28:48,971 --> 00:28:51,412
to be even talking here at GDC.

550
00:28:53,838 --> 00:28:56,759
I've been like unhappy, suffering anxiety,

551
00:28:56,779 --> 00:29:00,761
uncomfortable with myself since Solo came out last year.

552
00:29:01,901 --> 00:29:02,881
I don't play games anymore.

553
00:29:02,901 --> 00:29:05,222
I actually hate games right now.

554
00:29:05,962 --> 00:29:07,783
I'm struggling with game dev a lot.

555
00:29:07,943 --> 00:29:13,065
I'm trying to park game dev for a while in my life.

556
00:29:13,105 --> 00:29:16,486
And we're trying to keep Team Gotham afloat, the company.

557
00:29:17,146 --> 00:29:21,347
But I'm not really sure if it's even worth it anymore.

558
00:29:22,088 --> 00:29:24,029
So I'm not sure if I'm surviving failure,

559
00:29:24,449 --> 00:29:28,791
but I hope this talk might help you guys

560
00:29:28,951 --> 00:29:32,572
if anyone is in a similar situation.

561
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:35,753
I hope not, but I really hope it helps.

562
00:29:37,774 --> 00:29:40,074
So yeah, I love you and thank you.

563
00:29:45,936 --> 00:29:47,697
My name is Charlie Price.

564
00:29:47,857 --> 00:29:49,998
I'm the co-founder and creative director of Hidden Variable.

565
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:50,538
We're a small.

566
00:29:51,052 --> 00:29:55,258
Independent studio based down in Los Angeles when we were first founded in 2010

567
00:29:55,838 --> 00:29:58,922
We mostly made mobile puzzle games like baguette and tic tactics

568
00:29:59,383 --> 00:30:02,307
We worked with servo on threes to bring to Android and Xbox among other things

569
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:06,352
But more recently we're most well known for the game skull girls mobile

570
00:30:07,413 --> 00:30:07,793
trailer here

571
00:30:08,497 --> 00:30:10,359
For those who aren't aware, the original Skullgirls game

572
00:30:10,379 --> 00:30:11,339
was developed by Lab Zero.

573
00:30:11,379 --> 00:30:13,601
It's a 2D hand-animated fighting game

574
00:30:14,582 --> 00:30:17,364
that was released back in 2012.

575
00:30:17,704 --> 00:30:19,785
We approached them about going through and bringing

576
00:30:19,825 --> 00:30:20,586
Skullgirls to mobile.

577
00:30:20,606 --> 00:30:22,667
And part of our goal there was to go through and make

578
00:30:22,707 --> 00:30:24,729
fighting games more accessible for folks that otherwise find

579
00:30:24,749 --> 00:30:26,930
them intimidating, but without compromising their depth

580
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:29,132
and a lot of the creativity that you ultimately

581
00:30:29,172 --> 00:30:31,734
have when you're playing fighting games at a high level.

582
00:30:32,454 --> 00:30:34,275
So as a result, while we were able to take over

583
00:30:34,295 --> 00:30:35,616
a lot of the animations that they had already

584
00:30:35,636 --> 00:30:36,617
built, these beautiful animations.

585
00:30:37,358 --> 00:30:43,101
And some of the combat mechanics we had to make a lot of adjustments to go through and map it over to mobile native controls

586
00:30:43,181 --> 00:30:46,623
So mostly taps and swipes no virtual thumb sticks or anything like that

587
00:30:47,483 --> 00:30:52,266
In addition to all that stuff the mobile game unlike the console game was a free-to-play RPG

588
00:30:52,446 --> 00:30:55,127
So there was a whole host of additional systems. We had to go through and build

589
00:30:56,208 --> 00:30:58,750
progression systems, skill trees, signature abilities,

590
00:30:59,651 --> 00:31:03,293
social features like chat, live events like daily events,

591
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:05,315
and prize fights and rift battles,

592
00:31:05,395 --> 00:31:07,297
and all the bells and whistles you would normally expect

593
00:31:08,037 --> 00:31:08,838
from a free to play game.

594
00:31:09,518 --> 00:31:11,120
And it's a pretty ambitious thing for a small team,

595
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,901
and I'm incredibly proud of all the stuff

596
00:31:12,921 --> 00:31:13,922
that we were able to accomplish.

597
00:31:14,462 --> 00:31:15,923
However, this talk is not about all the things

598
00:31:15,943 --> 00:31:16,444
that we're proud of.

599
00:31:16,604 --> 00:31:19,186
Instead, this talk's about the time that we accidentally

600
00:31:19,206 --> 00:31:20,627
went and deleted all of our users' data.

601
00:31:22,051 --> 00:31:25,254
So, a brief history of how we got there.

602
00:31:25,854 --> 00:31:29,397
So actually, Skullgirls started back in 2014 at GDC.

603
00:31:30,157 --> 00:31:32,379
We decided to sign up with Autumn Games to go through and make this happen.

604
00:31:32,699 --> 00:31:35,802
A year later we were approached by Line, who were interested in going through and publishing

605
00:31:35,822 --> 00:31:38,684
the game, particularly to distribute it in Korea and Japan, which sounded awesome to

606
00:31:38,804 --> 00:31:42,227
us because those are really notoriously difficult territories to crack.

607
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:44,509
And, you know, again, fast forwarding,

608
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:47,072
spring 2017, we were able to go through

609
00:31:47,092 --> 00:31:48,333
and launch the game under the Lion label

610
00:31:49,254 --> 00:31:51,316
in the US and mostly worldwide,

611
00:31:51,356 --> 00:31:53,278
except for a planned launch in Korea and Japan

612
00:31:53,298 --> 00:31:54,720
a little bit later on in the year.

613
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,702
When we launched, everything was going really well.

614
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:58,824
The game was really well received, good reviews.

615
00:31:58,904 --> 00:32:01,006
We were getting a lot of organic downloads, which is awesome.

616
00:32:02,363 --> 00:32:03,864
But there were some challenges.

617
00:32:05,044 --> 00:32:07,265
Line was going through a little bit of corporate drama at the time.

618
00:32:07,285 --> 00:32:10,387
They'd recently gone through and acquired a new game studio, and as a result they were

619
00:32:10,427 --> 00:32:15,489
reshuffling some stuff, and so a lot of things were frozen, which included our marketing

620
00:32:15,529 --> 00:32:15,849
budget.

621
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:20,171
So while we were getting good organic users, we knew we needed to be kind of figuring out

622
00:32:20,211 --> 00:32:23,113
what our user acquisition plan was going to be in order to make sure that we were sustainable

623
00:32:23,793 --> 00:32:24,333
moving forward.

624
00:32:24,673 --> 00:32:28,475
So while we were hopeful that that would resolve itself, it became pretty evident that it wasn't.

625
00:32:28,775 --> 00:32:31,796
So we made the tough decision to part ways with Line forever.

626
00:32:32,296 --> 00:32:36,077
So that came with its own set of challenges across the board.

627
00:32:36,617 --> 00:32:37,838
First off was a technical challenge.

628
00:32:38,318 --> 00:32:43,059
We had basically originally planned to go through and like kind of pluck a back end off the shelf

629
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:44,579
and be able to use a lot of existing features.

630
00:32:44,619 --> 00:32:48,640
But when we partnered with Line, they basically required us to build something from the ground up

631
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,321
to all of their exacting requirements.

632
00:32:50,721 --> 00:32:54,642
And now that we were migrating, we had to somehow untangle all of that stuff

633
00:32:54,802 --> 00:32:57,643
and migrate it over to AWS so that we could go through and manage it ourselves.

634
00:32:58,844 --> 00:33:02,867
We were fortunate that we were able to find an expert back-end partner who knew all these things backwards and forwards

635
00:33:02,887 --> 00:33:06,331
so we could kind of learn on the go with them and then we could focus on the client-side stuff.

636
00:33:06,931 --> 00:33:11,776
The client-side stuff had its own challenges. In an ideal world, Line would just transfer the game over to us and players,

637
00:33:12,096 --> 00:33:17,261
you know, one day the publisher would change from one company to another and players wouldn't be the wiser, they'd just be able to carry on.

638
00:33:17,641 --> 00:33:20,324
Line was not comfortable doing that for data privacy reasons,

639
00:33:20,664 --> 00:33:24,027
nor were they comfortable just transferring all of the user data over to us behind the scenes.

640
00:33:24,368 --> 00:33:27,291
So instead, what we had to do was let them opt in,

641
00:33:27,511 --> 00:33:30,914
which basically meant that, imagine logging into a game and saying,

642
00:33:30,974 --> 00:33:33,016
hey, by the way, this game's going to shut down in two months,

643
00:33:33,076 --> 00:33:34,978
but it's not going to go away. There's going to be a new game.

644
00:33:35,338 --> 00:33:37,621
All we need is for you to put in your email address and your password,

645
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:39,262
and then later when this game shuts down,

646
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:42,185
in the new game you can log in with this stuff and everything's going to be fine.

647
00:33:43,126 --> 00:33:45,626
So we did everything we could to try and make that a palatable thing.

648
00:33:45,666 --> 00:33:47,327
We incentivized it, gave people rewards.

649
00:33:47,967 --> 00:33:51,148
But when it was all said and done, when we finally did the migration, we went from 500,000

650
00:33:52,068 --> 00:33:54,069
total users that we had before down to 50,000.

651
00:33:54,609 --> 00:33:59,831
So that was a pretty big hit, but they were our most engaged users, we told ourselves.

652
00:33:59,851 --> 00:34:00,511
So that's great.

653
00:34:01,431 --> 00:34:02,252
And it's time to move on.

654
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:02,912
Time to move forward.

655
00:34:02,952 --> 00:34:03,552
It's a new beginning.

656
00:34:03,832 --> 00:34:04,492
We're going to be fine.

657
00:34:04,693 --> 00:34:05,353
It's going to be fine.

658
00:34:06,434 --> 00:34:09,076
So in January of 2018, right after we did this migration,

659
00:34:09,316 --> 00:34:10,217
things were looking pretty good.

660
00:34:11,038 --> 00:34:12,880
We had gone through and relaunched successfully,

661
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,361
the migration, which is complicated,

662
00:34:14,421 --> 00:34:15,542
had turned out, it went okay.

663
00:34:16,303 --> 00:34:17,824
We were doing some proper user acquisition,

664
00:34:17,864 --> 00:34:19,286
we'd been saving up our marketing dollars,

665
00:34:19,346 --> 00:34:21,128
and we invested and we were able to get

666
00:34:21,148 --> 00:34:23,149
almost 200,000 users in our first month, which is awesome.

667
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:25,692
And our back-end partner was handling

668
00:34:25,732 --> 00:34:26,993
all the different ups and downs that come

669
00:34:27,013 --> 00:34:28,655
with running a live game, so that was really good.

670
00:34:29,048 --> 00:34:30,529
And then we heard word through the grapevine

671
00:34:30,549 --> 00:34:32,270
that we might have an app store feature that was coming up.

672
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:33,651
And so we're like, thank god, this is perfect.

673
00:34:34,311 --> 00:34:36,372
So what we did, just to be safe, we

674
00:34:36,412 --> 00:34:38,473
decided to go through and double our server bandwidth,

675
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:39,494
just to make sure that we could handle

676
00:34:39,514 --> 00:34:41,575
the hopeful influx of all these new users

677
00:34:41,595 --> 00:34:42,456
we're going to be dealing with.

678
00:34:43,316 --> 00:34:44,957
So in general, things are going really, really well.

679
00:34:46,145 --> 00:34:53,107
So 0800 Friday, February 2nd, 2018, mere days before this purported feature, I get a phone

680
00:34:53,127 --> 00:34:57,968
call from one of our engineers who regretfully informs me that our back-end partner, instead

681
00:34:57,988 --> 00:35:02,649
of provisioning a new shard, accidentally reprovisioned our live shard, effectively

682
00:35:02,689 --> 00:35:05,650
reformatting it and wiping all of our user data.

683
00:35:07,951 --> 00:35:08,691
So I took a moment.

684
00:35:11,111 --> 00:35:12,952
And I said, okay, we're going to be down for a bit.

685
00:35:12,972 --> 00:35:13,512
That's awful.

686
00:35:13,772 --> 00:35:13,832
Oh!

687
00:35:14,726 --> 00:35:15,426
What about the backups?

688
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,347
How long will it take for us to go through and restore from our backups?

689
00:35:18,128 --> 00:35:19,108
And that was the kicker.

690
00:35:19,869 --> 00:35:20,709
There were no backups.

691
00:35:21,669 --> 00:35:24,551
Our partner had said they were doing backups, but we had never bothered to check.

692
00:35:25,671 --> 00:35:28,913
And so as a result, we were left with no data at all.

693
00:35:29,473 --> 00:35:32,014
It was a pretty rough day, as you might imagine.

694
00:35:32,915 --> 00:35:35,076
We'd been through so much getting to this point.

695
00:35:37,027 --> 00:35:40,549
We, you know, not only building the game, which seemingly was like a great game and

696
00:35:40,569 --> 00:35:43,692
people dug it, and then we had to migrate and then we just rebuilt it and we're right

697
00:35:43,732 --> 00:35:47,034
on the cusp of this great new moment for us and somehow we just torpedoed ourselves.

698
00:35:48,055 --> 00:35:50,637
So you know, it's pretty disheartening for the team as a whole.

699
00:35:51,178 --> 00:35:54,961
And there was a very real temptation for us to want to go through and basically absolve

700
00:35:55,001 --> 00:35:55,941
ourselves of blame.

701
00:35:56,021 --> 00:35:59,384
After all, we weren't the ones that pushed the button or pulled the plug or whatever

702
00:35:59,404 --> 00:36:00,185
metaphor you want to use.

703
00:36:00,912 --> 00:36:04,452
However, it was really important for us to go through and reflect on the fact that ultimately,

704
00:36:04,592 --> 00:36:06,373
even though they're our partner, they're our responsibility.

705
00:36:06,413 --> 00:36:07,653
This game is our responsibility.

706
00:36:07,693 --> 00:36:11,814
We are responsible to our players, are responsible to our customers, to go through and maintain

707
00:36:11,834 --> 00:36:12,914
the sanctity of their data.

708
00:36:13,674 --> 00:36:16,915
I know a lot of these things can feel like an act of God in the moment, but reflecting

709
00:36:16,975 --> 00:36:19,135
on it, there are always opportunities.

710
00:36:19,195 --> 00:36:21,776
Maybe we couldn't have prevented the action itself, but there's definitely things we could

711
00:36:21,796 --> 00:36:25,377
have done in order to go through and prevent the consequences from being as dire.

712
00:36:26,437 --> 00:36:28,077
It was our responsibility to go through and make it right.

713
00:36:29,485 --> 00:36:30,165
Assessing the damage.

714
00:36:30,865 --> 00:36:31,966
So there was some good news.

715
00:36:32,406 --> 00:36:36,067
We still had that 50,000 users worth of data.

716
00:36:36,107 --> 00:36:39,088
It's a month old, but some data's better than no data, so that's something.

717
00:36:39,928 --> 00:36:44,210
And then we had this activity log, which was basically a separate server, thank God, that

718
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:48,091
was used to track any time someone opened a mystery box or a character leveled up, major

719
00:36:48,131 --> 00:36:48,791
progression events.

720
00:36:48,811 --> 00:36:53,153
And we realized we could run a script on that server in order to basically go through and

721
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:55,353
roughly reconstruct most of the data for our players.

722
00:36:55,393 --> 00:36:57,634
So it seemed like maybe this is all going to be okay.

723
00:36:57,814 --> 00:36:58,674
We're just going to get through it.

724
00:36:58,694 --> 00:36:59,135
It'll be great.

725
00:37:00,175 --> 00:37:01,015
But there was some bad news.

726
00:37:01,175 --> 00:37:05,237
Unfortunately, because it was from the activity log, we had zero authentication data.

727
00:37:05,337 --> 00:37:10,339
So basically, we could reassemble 200,000 accounts, but we had no idea who it belonged

728
00:37:10,379 --> 00:37:10,419
to.

729
00:37:10,439 --> 00:37:10,479
So...

730
00:37:10,499 --> 00:37:10,539
So...

731
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:11,040
So...

732
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:11,100
So...

733
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:11,180
So...

734
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:11,240
So...

735
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:11,300
So...

736
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:11,600
So...

737
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:11,660
So...

738
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:11,740
So...

739
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:11,840
So...

740
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:11,940
So...

741
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,000
So...

742
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:12,060
So...

743
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:12,120
So...

744
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:12,360
So...

745
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:12,420
So...

746
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:12,520
So...

747
00:37:13,015 --> 00:37:15,636
The only way we could ultimately remap it would be to do it manually.

748
00:37:16,336 --> 00:37:19,097
And as you can imagine, that would be a pretty time-consuming process.

749
00:37:19,517 --> 00:37:21,638
So in the meantime, we'd been down for three to four days.

750
00:37:21,658 --> 00:37:23,558
All of our KPIs obviously had tanked.

751
00:37:24,099 --> 00:37:27,240
We'd been kind of keeping people abreast, but being a little cagey just as we were figuring

752
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,640
out what actually happened and what our options were and what was going on.

753
00:37:30,141 --> 00:37:31,881
But it was time for us to go through and deliver the news.

754
00:37:32,622 --> 00:37:36,123
So I wrote this long forum post explaining everything.

755
00:37:37,083 --> 00:37:41,124
And I won't go through the whole thing, but the main tenets were we wanted to take responsibility

756
00:37:41,164 --> 00:37:41,725
for what happened.

757
00:37:42,281 --> 00:37:46,224
let them know what was going on, give them kind of the full story of how we got to this point,

758
00:37:46,544 --> 00:37:49,687
and reassure them that we were going to do everything in our power to go through and regain their trust,

759
00:37:50,207 --> 00:37:53,470
and obviously apologizing profusely. That's kind of a given throughout this entire thing.

760
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,831
So we basically presented them with two options.

761
00:37:55,872 --> 00:37:58,734
So one, we could go through and manually restore your data.

762
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:01,556
As I mentioned before, this is a pretty trying proposition.

763
00:38:01,596 --> 00:38:03,157
It's kind of like looking for a needle in a haystack.

764
00:38:04,018 --> 00:38:10,102
We could get clues from players like their account name, the last few things that they did, the state of their collection.

765
00:38:10,682 --> 00:38:13,865
There's a number of clues that we could maybe triangulate and try and figure out who it was,

766
00:38:13,905 --> 00:38:17,447
but we didn't want to give someone access to someone else's account in case they came and asked for it later.

767
00:38:17,467 --> 00:38:19,168
So it was kind of a tricky proposition.

768
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:24,112
We also encountered a strange phenomenon where we'd find someone we're 100% confident this is that person,

769
00:38:24,372 --> 00:38:29,996
and they'd say, oh actually, I'm pretty sure I had two or three gold characters that just don't happen to be part of my collection.

770
00:38:30,617 --> 00:38:33,582
Which is really strange, we have no idea why that would be the case given everything else

771
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:33,802
as well.

772
00:38:33,842 --> 00:38:35,485
Never the common characters, only the rare characters.

773
00:38:36,545 --> 00:38:38,066
So I'll talk a little later about how we handled that.

774
00:38:38,126 --> 00:38:40,788
But needless to say, this is a very time-consuming exercise.

775
00:38:41,388 --> 00:38:44,630
So we presented an alternative option, which is basically a free starting over gift.

776
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:47,892
Why would you want your old data when you can get even better new data?

777
00:38:48,772 --> 00:38:54,476
So basically, for 72 hours after we came back up, we basically had this bundle waiting for

778
00:38:54,516 --> 00:38:57,557
people in their mailbox after they finished the tutorial, which would be any new players

779
00:38:57,677 --> 00:38:59,278
or anybody who lost their data before.

780
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:02,440
And basically the idea was a lot of these players have been playing for a month and

781
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:02,740
change.

782
00:39:05,182 --> 00:39:08,023
worth about $400 in in-game contents.

783
00:39:09,043 --> 00:39:11,684
That was way more valuable than most people's progression

784
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,465
up until that point, unless they were super hardcore.

785
00:39:13,865 --> 00:39:14,885
Because we knew we couldn't go through

786
00:39:14,905 --> 00:39:16,526
and handle 200,000 users worth of data.

787
00:39:16,786 --> 00:39:18,166
Hopefully a bunch of people would just go through

788
00:39:18,186 --> 00:39:18,907
and take it and run.

789
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,167
The idea here is that we were comfortable

790
00:39:21,228 --> 00:39:23,748
sacrificing revenue for retention.

791
00:39:23,808 --> 00:39:25,869
We wanted to make sure that at least players

792
00:39:25,889 --> 00:39:26,990
would stick around and maybe one day

793
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:28,810
they'll trust us enough again to spend money in our game.

794
00:39:30,041 --> 00:39:32,283
So during this period, right after I made that post,

795
00:39:32,323 --> 00:39:35,547
we almost overnight, we had over 2,000 requests that came in.

796
00:39:36,188 --> 00:39:39,051
Normally we have one person that does customer service part time,

797
00:39:39,772 --> 00:39:42,775
but this go around, everybody stopped what they were doing in the company,

798
00:39:42,795 --> 00:39:45,979
across multiple projects, disciplines, everybody was doing customer service.

799
00:39:45,999 --> 00:39:47,721
You're an artist, an engineer, producer, it doesn't matter.

800
00:39:47,741 --> 00:39:50,304
You're either in Freshdesk talking to high-rate customers.

801
00:39:51,145 --> 00:39:53,366
or you were going through and trying to find their data in the database.

802
00:39:54,127 --> 00:39:57,929
And in a strange way, this was actually like a great bonding experience for us as a group.

803
00:39:57,989 --> 00:40:02,153
Obviously, we just suffered this shared trauma, which brought us together in a strange way.

804
00:40:02,793 --> 00:40:05,935
But for the first time, you know, we're an ambitious studio working on multiple things.

805
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:10,357
this was actually the first time that literally every single person at the studio was doing the exact same thing.

806
00:40:10,897 --> 00:40:12,957
Being able to go through and see customers that were very upset,

807
00:40:13,217 --> 00:40:16,038
and then hopefully by the end of the process, ultimately be satisfied.

808
00:40:16,798 --> 00:40:20,619
When it was all said and done, we manually resolved over 3,500 requests from people,

809
00:40:21,099 --> 00:40:25,161
which is good, that means a lot of people took the free bundle instead of going through and reaching out to us.

810
00:40:25,961 --> 00:40:30,482
But ultimately, even though we tried to front-load it, it took us months to fully work through all of these requests.

811
00:40:31,535 --> 00:40:34,797
So despite all of this stuff, there were still people who weren't happy.

812
00:40:35,277 --> 00:40:36,598
You can't please everyone.

813
00:40:37,538 --> 00:40:41,360
So lots of colorful comments on the forums and in mails and in reviews and whatnot.

814
00:40:42,441 --> 00:40:43,981
And frankly, they had every right to be upset.

815
00:40:44,402 --> 00:40:47,823
We kind of broke the fundamental covenant of we will take care of your data.

816
00:40:48,524 --> 00:40:52,345
So while we were doing everything in our power to try and help folks, you can't make everybody

817
00:40:52,385 --> 00:40:52,646
happy.

818
00:40:53,286 --> 00:40:56,367
Thankfully, there were a lot of people that saw things another way.

819
00:40:56,908 --> 00:40:58,508
The way we were handling it, the way that we were...

820
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:02,184
doing kind of one-on-one support for every single person, that we were very communicative.

821
00:41:02,504 --> 00:41:06,168
People seemed to be very appreciative of that approach, and frankly, we had a very strong

822
00:41:06,208 --> 00:41:09,271
relationship with our community beforehand, which I think helped set the table to make

823
00:41:09,311 --> 00:41:13,015
sure that we would get the benefit of the doubt when some of this stuff ultimately happened.

824
00:41:14,216 --> 00:41:15,437
So in terms of consequences...

825
00:41:16,014 --> 00:41:18,256
As I mentioned before, all of our KPIs dropped to nothing.

826
00:41:18,716 --> 00:41:21,098
We had no idea what to expect when the game went live again.

827
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:25,242
We were presuming that our revenue was going to go through and take a big hit.

828
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:28,164
Maybe some people would eventually go through and come back, but again, we didn't really

829
00:41:28,184 --> 00:41:28,945
know what to expect.

830
00:41:29,566 --> 00:41:35,371
Thankfully, when we relaunched, everything bounced back a lot better than we expected.

831
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:39,214
So we took a little bit of a hit, but when we did our next content update at the end

832
00:41:39,234 --> 00:41:39,535
of the month...

833
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:43,121
Our numbers spiked again, like they always do with the content update, and we were able

834
00:41:43,161 --> 00:41:46,122
to more or less, obviously we still had a lot of work to do behind the scenes to make

835
00:41:46,142 --> 00:41:48,643
sure everyone was satisfied, but we were able to keep sailing.

836
00:41:48,663 --> 00:41:49,343
It didn't sink us.

837
00:41:50,183 --> 00:41:54,264
In addition, we migrated over from the back-end partner that will not be named to Mission,

838
00:41:54,304 --> 00:41:56,225
who is an amazing back-end partner that we've been working with now.

839
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:58,246
I highly recommend it if you're looking for a game as a service.

840
00:41:58,286 --> 00:41:59,146
They never delete your data.

841
00:42:00,666 --> 00:42:06,328
So if you ever find yourself in a similar situation, I hope to God that you don't, here

842
00:42:06,348 --> 00:42:07,588
are some general takeaways.

843
00:42:08,908 --> 00:42:11,350
that you can bear in mind if and when that happens.

844
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:14,952
So first and foremost is obviously taking responsibility.

845
00:42:15,973 --> 00:42:19,835
I did not mention the name of the other company that we worked with because ultimately it

846
00:42:19,855 --> 00:42:21,196
was our responsibility to deal with this.

847
00:42:21,216 --> 00:42:22,697
It was our responsibility to test their work.

848
00:42:23,404 --> 00:42:26,846
Our customers don't care who ultimately did the actual action.

849
00:42:26,906 --> 00:42:30,949
It's on us as developers to maintain the sanctity of our environment and their data and everything

850
00:42:30,969 --> 00:42:31,469
else as well.

851
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,511
But it's also important to make sure that you keep your chin up.

852
00:42:35,452 --> 00:42:39,194
Obviously, if you ever find yourself in a situation remotely close to this, it can be

853
00:42:39,214 --> 00:42:39,955
pretty dark times.

854
00:42:40,075 --> 00:42:44,938
It's easy to succumb to despair, to feel like you're a terrible person or a terrible game

855
00:42:44,958 --> 00:42:48,460
developer, and really, at the end of the day, shit happens.

856
00:42:49,181 --> 00:42:51,422
You're not going to be able to move forward if you're dwelling in the past.

857
00:42:51,875 --> 00:42:55,927
So, you know, just try and be open and authentic and genuine with your fans and

858
00:42:56,148 --> 00:42:58,415
hopefully they'll give you another shot at it moving forward.

859
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:04,535
I mentioned before that people would make some pretty strange requests of us that really

860
00:43:04,555 --> 00:43:05,796
had no foundation in fact.

861
00:43:06,536 --> 00:43:10,597
However, when push came to shove, people asked for those gold characters, we just gave it

862
00:43:10,617 --> 00:43:10,817
to them.

863
00:43:12,137 --> 00:43:13,197
This was for a number of reasons.

864
00:43:13,317 --> 00:43:15,158
One, it was the fastest way to deal with the situation.

865
00:43:15,218 --> 00:43:18,959
As I mentioned, we had thousands of requests that were coming in, and the longer it took

866
00:43:18,979 --> 00:43:22,319
for us to go through and respond to one user and satisfy their needs, there were dozens

867
00:43:22,339 --> 00:43:24,020
of other users that were still waiting for a response.

868
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:25,120
We needed to move through it quickly.

869
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,101
It was also because we trusted them, even if we didn't always trust them.

870
00:43:30,004 --> 00:43:32,151
But they deserved it in part because we owed it to them.

871
00:43:32,211 --> 00:43:33,355
We're the ones that have made the mistake.

872
00:43:33,817 --> 00:43:35,162
We need to give them the benefit of the doubt.

873
00:43:35,559 --> 00:43:37,460
And frankly, anything we do to go through and make them happy,

874
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:38,781
the better off we'll ultimately be.

875
00:43:39,061 --> 00:43:43,123
A lot of this aligns with some of the exploitable customer service policies

876
00:43:43,223 --> 00:43:46,285
with companies like Costco and Nordstrom, famously,

877
00:43:46,765 --> 00:43:48,626
that we try to go through and adopt as well as part of this.

878
00:43:49,647 --> 00:43:52,028
And even if you just look at it from a purely pragmatic perspective,

879
00:43:52,829 --> 00:43:55,470
while it may seem like players are exploiting you for free stuff,

880
00:43:55,790 --> 00:43:59,152
another way to look at it is this is a very low-cost investment

881
00:43:59,272 --> 00:44:00,933
in retention of our highest-value users.

882
00:44:01,053 --> 00:44:02,874
If they're going to be happy and they're going to go through and stick around,

883
00:44:03,257 --> 00:44:07,220
Giving them a few free things that they clearly covet early on really isn't going to move

884
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,341
the needle that much in the long term.

885
00:44:08,361 --> 00:44:11,204
It's much more valuable to have these people stick around for the long haul.

886
00:44:12,125 --> 00:44:14,187
I mentioned that we have a really strong relationship with our community.

887
00:44:14,827 --> 00:44:18,871
My in-game handle is MightyZug, and whenever I start typing Discord, someone invariably

888
00:44:18,911 --> 00:44:19,572
posts this image.

889
00:44:20,592 --> 00:44:24,276
We're always doing little AMAs and whatnot with our fans and the forums.

890
00:44:24,716 --> 00:44:26,298
on Discord, in our in-game chat.

891
00:44:26,878 --> 00:44:29,080
And so we're also, we all actively play the game.

892
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:31,202
We don't play the game with like God-level accounts.

893
00:44:31,282 --> 00:44:33,163
Some of us are high-level, some of us are mid-level.

894
00:44:33,844 --> 00:44:36,927
But as a result, people see us in prizefights and other in-game events.

895
00:44:37,347 --> 00:44:40,770
And as a result, you know, the community really knows who we are as people.

896
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:43,392
They see us as accessible and relatable,

897
00:44:43,733 --> 00:44:46,435
as opposed to just representatives of a faceless entity,

898
00:44:46,955 --> 00:44:47,796
which I think really helped.

899
00:44:48,277 --> 00:44:50,859
We're also very transparent about our gameplay and business decisions.

900
00:44:50,879 --> 00:44:52,560
Whenever we need to go through and make changes, we always...

901
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,841
post our rationale on the forum if we need to go through

902
00:44:54,861 --> 00:44:56,762
and change the way we're distributing content

903
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:58,604
in order to increase revenue

904
00:44:58,644 --> 00:44:59,724
so we can reinvest it in the game.

905
00:44:59,764 --> 00:45:00,965
We tell them, hey, we're doing this

906
00:45:00,985 --> 00:45:02,947
so we can increase revenue so we can reinvest it in the game.

907
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:06,049
And generally, our fans are very receptive to that.

908
00:45:06,689 --> 00:45:08,370
We also respond to every single user review

909
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:09,251
that we get, good or bad.

910
00:45:09,591 --> 00:45:10,992
It's important to remember that your community

911
00:45:11,052 --> 00:45:12,613
is not just your most hardcore players

912
00:45:12,653 --> 00:45:13,554
that are in your Discord.

913
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:15,455
They're anyone who's ultimately reaching out to you

914
00:45:15,515 --> 00:45:18,037
and your review board is a public-facing forum

915
00:45:18,057 --> 00:45:19,538
where people can see who you are

916
00:45:19,558 --> 00:45:20,718
and how you engage with your fans.

917
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:22,340
Last but not least.

918
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:28,002
Being open, honest and empathetic beyond just regular updates with folks, as I mentioned

919
00:45:28,022 --> 00:45:33,124
before, when you have people reaching out to you with extremely irate, profanity laden

920
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:37,186
emails, it's important to remember that empathy begets empathy.

921
00:45:37,686 --> 00:45:40,588
This is an example of some of the language that we would go through news when talking

922
00:45:40,608 --> 00:45:41,008
with folks.

923
00:45:41,268 --> 00:45:42,508
We understand that you're upset.

924
00:45:42,568 --> 00:45:46,350
We would be too, putting ourselves in their shoes and showing that we're real people on

925
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:46,770
the other end.

926
00:45:47,659 --> 00:45:51,900
And you'd be surprised at how many people that started with just completely dark, utter

927
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:56,281
vitriol by the time the entire process was over, they were apologizing for their past

928
00:45:56,321 --> 00:45:59,281
behavior in the first email, even though they had every right to be upset.

929
00:46:00,202 --> 00:46:03,782
Obviously, building your faction with your community in advance really goes a long way

930
00:46:04,042 --> 00:46:07,063
before the crisis occurs to make sure that you can ultimately weather the storm.

931
00:46:08,023 --> 00:46:11,464
So in conclusion, if you ever want to bring your team together and galvanize the support

932
00:46:11,484 --> 00:46:13,064
of your player base, simply delete everybody's data.

933
00:46:13,084 --> 00:46:13,724
It works every time.

934
00:46:13,744 --> 00:46:15,004
Thank you.

935
00:46:15,124 --> 00:46:16,185
Thank you.

936
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:28,022
Cool, so I think this is the time where I remind everyone

937
00:46:28,182 --> 00:46:30,083
to go through and make sure that you fill out your surveys.

938
00:46:30,183 --> 00:46:34,545
But I guess we're going to do Q&A. So either we'll

939
00:46:34,585 --> 00:46:35,206
all come up here.

940
00:46:35,226 --> 00:46:37,547
You guys are welcome to approach the various mics.

941
00:46:38,267 --> 00:46:39,968
And either we'll approach the podium

942
00:46:39,988 --> 00:46:40,849
or these mics will turn on.

943
00:46:40,909 --> 00:46:41,529
Or we'll figure it out.

944
00:46:41,569 --> 00:46:41,969
It'll be great.

945
00:46:44,851 --> 00:46:46,131
Just make sure when you ask your question,

946
00:46:46,792 --> 00:46:48,753
say the name of whomever it is you're asking it to,

947
00:46:49,914 --> 00:46:50,554
John, Juan, and Charlie.

948
00:46:54,612 --> 00:46:55,813
if anyone approaches the mic.

949
00:46:55,833 --> 00:47:01,057
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

950
00:47:01,998 --> 00:47:02,919
Let me guess if there's not a...

951
00:47:02,999 --> 00:47:03,579
Yeah, exactly.

952
00:47:06,121 --> 00:47:06,301
Cool.

953
00:47:06,542 --> 00:47:06,902
Hey, John.

954
00:47:06,942 --> 00:47:07,262
Go for it.

955
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:08,703
I got a question for you, John.

956
00:47:08,723 --> 00:47:09,704
For me?

957
00:47:10,005 --> 00:47:10,185
Yeah.

958
00:47:10,505 --> 00:47:11,145
So my name's Jack.

959
00:47:11,326 --> 00:47:12,987
I'm not actually in the game industry,

960
00:47:13,628 --> 00:47:15,049
just a third-party guy here.

961
00:47:15,569 --> 00:47:15,969
Okay.

962
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:17,271
As somebody that's usually blind

963
00:47:17,451 --> 00:47:18,892
to some of the things you described today,

964
00:47:19,693 --> 00:47:21,274
what's advice you could give somebody like me

965
00:47:21,314 --> 00:47:23,656
in the crowd to help somebody like that?

966
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:24,891
Hmm.

967
00:47:25,431 --> 00:47:28,053
I feel like that is a good question.

968
00:47:28,193 --> 00:47:28,514
Thank you.

969
00:47:28,834 --> 00:47:30,756
So for anyone who didn't hear, for those

970
00:47:31,396 --> 00:47:35,159
for people who do not, who are somewhat blind to mental health

971
00:47:35,179 --> 00:47:37,541
issues, or I think this is probably even more broadly

972
00:47:37,581 --> 00:47:39,543
applicable to just issues that you may not see,

973
00:47:40,764 --> 00:47:45,388
what advice do I have to be understanding and comforting

974
00:47:45,468 --> 00:47:46,789
for those people?

975
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:48,811
Yeah, I think that.

976
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:57,533
from my perspective, really has to do with the environment that you're cultivating, right?

977
00:47:58,994 --> 00:48:03,036
And the things that you are asking, I mean, it depends on the relationship, right?

978
00:48:03,056 --> 00:48:07,978
Like an employer to employee relationship is slightly different than an employee to

979
00:48:08,038 --> 00:48:11,380
employee relationship, or I don't know, just people within the same industry.

980
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:19,184
Listening for people who are willing to talk about it is an extremely important thing,

981
00:48:19,484 --> 00:48:21,825
and listening in a way that is not necessarily.

982
00:48:22,288 --> 00:48:24,508
like you trying to give a solution to someone else

983
00:48:24,769 --> 00:48:30,050
or you trying to, I don't know, help them in some way.

984
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:31,350
Sometimes you just need to sit back

985
00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:34,371
and hear the things that people want you to say

986
00:48:34,391 --> 00:48:36,092
or people want to say to you.

987
00:48:36,112 --> 00:48:40,373
And I think just doing a little bit of research also,

988
00:48:40,513 --> 00:48:42,894
like those resources that I pointed to are not,

989
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:45,935
there's way more, the internet is a good place.

990
00:48:45,955 --> 00:48:49,216
Be careful, like vet your sources, obviously.

991
00:48:51,012 --> 00:48:53,516
But I think there's just a little bit of information

992
00:48:53,576 --> 00:48:57,242
can go a long way in order to, I don't know,

993
00:48:57,823 --> 00:49:00,707
figure out what sort of signs you are looking for.

994
00:49:01,529 --> 00:49:04,393
And lastly, just don't jump to conclusions,

995
00:49:04,493 --> 00:49:05,775
I think, for a lot of people.

996
00:49:05,815 --> 00:49:06,436
Like if something.

997
00:49:07,462 --> 00:49:09,605
Even if you have a sneaking suspicion or something,

998
00:49:09,705 --> 00:49:11,767
I don't know, it's very easy to hand wave

999
00:49:11,867 --> 00:49:13,389
over certain behaviors and be like,

1000
00:49:13,449 --> 00:49:14,610
that person's just an asshole,

1001
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:16,932
or this person, whatever, they're lazy.

1002
00:49:19,055 --> 00:49:20,196
Sometimes those things are true,

1003
00:49:20,356 --> 00:49:23,599
but having that as a default response, I think,

1004
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:26,462
is just a little callous.

1005
00:49:28,634 --> 00:49:33,918
Without like a specific example, like I don't know that I could give you like a thing necessarily

1006
00:49:33,978 --> 00:49:36,640
to do, but broadly, hopefully that is somewhat helpful.

1007
00:49:37,041 --> 00:49:37,781
It is, yeah, thanks.

1008
00:49:42,985 --> 00:49:49,491
Hi, my name is Tote and I guess I have something of a comment that, you know, any of you might

1009
00:49:49,551 --> 00:49:50,431
like to elaborate on.

1010
00:49:51,161 --> 00:49:56,462
So I founded my first company in 97, and I'm horribly old,

1011
00:49:56,883 --> 00:49:58,843
so you can imagine how many mistakes I've made.

1012
00:49:59,823 --> 00:50:03,204
And for me, I never learned from them.

1013
00:50:03,244 --> 00:50:03,925
That's the problem.

1014
00:50:06,385 --> 00:50:08,366
But I've been able to handle them in one way.

1015
00:50:09,086 --> 00:50:13,187
It's trying to go for TTM, time to mistake,

1016
00:50:13,827 --> 00:50:14,928
as short as possible.

1017
00:50:15,441 --> 00:50:18,882
The mistake with the vertical slice was taking six months.

1018
00:50:18,922 --> 00:50:19,882
Why not six days?

1019
00:50:20,202 --> 00:50:23,583
You know, do one in six days and you'll learn two-thirds

1020
00:50:23,643 --> 00:50:26,344
of what you learned from doing it, you know, in six months.

1021
00:50:27,004 --> 00:50:28,805
So that's, I have a plaque.

1022
00:50:29,225 --> 00:50:31,666
Let's make spectacular mistakes, you know.

1023
00:50:32,126 --> 00:50:34,086
Make big ones and make them fast.

1024
00:50:34,647 --> 00:50:35,907
That would be, yeah, that's my comment.

1025
00:50:36,527 --> 00:50:36,967
Elaborate.

1026
00:50:37,007 --> 00:50:37,547
Thank you.

1027
00:50:37,988 --> 00:50:38,648
Yeah, bravo to that.

1028
00:50:39,364 --> 00:50:45,068
Hey, and by the way, this is a session like nothing I've been to at GDC, and I love it, guys. You're brave.

1029
00:50:45,088 --> 00:50:52,694
Thank you.

1030
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:55,260
Oh, we have more.

1031
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,301
I guess we should, yeah.

1032
00:50:56,361 --> 00:50:59,162
Basically, he was celebrating the importance

1033
00:50:59,202 --> 00:51:01,043
of going through and making mistakes

1034
00:51:01,083 --> 00:51:02,664
and talking through it to make sure that you can ultimately

1035
00:51:02,704 --> 00:51:03,205
move beyond that.

1036
00:51:03,325 --> 00:51:04,465
I'm kind of repeating the question,

1037
00:51:04,565 --> 00:51:06,186
even though it wasn't fully a question.

1038
00:51:06,907 --> 00:51:09,528
But yes, we're big proponents of make new mistakes.

1039
00:51:10,308 --> 00:51:12,790
So finding the time to retrospect on what went wrong

1040
00:51:12,910 --> 00:51:16,231
and not being afraid to ask enough whys to really get

1041
00:51:16,291 --> 00:51:18,132
to the core of it is super important to be

1042
00:51:18,172 --> 00:51:19,093
able to move beyond all that stuff.

1043
00:51:21,394 --> 00:51:22,235
Oh, yeah, go for it.

1044
00:51:22,693 --> 00:51:28,476
Hello, yeah, I actually don't really have a question. I just wanted to take the time to thank you guys for speaking it was

1045
00:51:29,396 --> 00:51:34,499
Clearly something that I don't think was easy to talk about so thank you so much for sharing your stories

1046
00:51:34,679 --> 00:51:44,845
I really do appreciate it. I really enjoyed hearing each of your stories. Thank you. Thank you so much appreciate it

1047
00:51:44,865 --> 00:51:46,025
Go for it

1048
00:51:46,442 --> 00:51:51,345
Hi. So, well, first off, again, thank you for sharing all of that with us.

1049
00:51:52,566 --> 00:51:58,109
I know it probably was not easy to have to relive that in front of a crowd of strangers.

1050
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:01,611
But my question is for Juan.

1051
00:52:03,112 --> 00:52:09,416
You mentioned that you and your teammates were just coming out of university

1052
00:52:09,556 --> 00:52:14,299
and you hadn't really learned about what the industry was like in order to,

1053
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:15,720
you know, be able to...

1054
00:52:16,650 --> 00:52:21,433
survive what came next better.

1055
00:52:22,273 --> 00:52:25,015
What would you suggest that maybe we can do

1056
00:52:25,835 --> 00:52:30,057
to learn about that stuff before going into a big venture?

1057
00:52:30,077 --> 00:52:34,620
Yeah, I think, I think I would do,

1058
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:39,583
what I would do now is just go and email people

1059
00:52:39,623 --> 00:52:43,745
that I know that have some experience in the past.

1060
00:52:44,350 --> 00:52:47,873
I think in Spain, we don't have this huge industry.

1061
00:52:47,913 --> 00:52:51,676
We have a huge community, but it's basically people like,

1062
00:52:52,957 --> 00:52:54,919
not like me, maybe more successful.

1063
00:52:55,579 --> 00:52:59,442
But it's really starting to kick off now.

1064
00:52:59,723 --> 00:53:04,426
So back in 2013, 2014, reaching out to people

1065
00:53:04,486 --> 00:53:06,128
wasn't that easy as it is now.

1066
00:53:08,246 --> 00:53:17,489
But again, I think if I were a student today, I would go and just bother people that might

1067
00:53:17,749 --> 00:53:21,190
have some experience that I of course don't have yet.

1068
00:53:21,790 --> 00:53:27,933
Because in university I think it's not really possible to teach how the industry is in some

1069
00:53:27,973 --> 00:53:28,093
way.

1070
00:53:28,173 --> 00:53:33,415
So yeah, I would say just go and bother some people in the GDC or whatever.

1071
00:53:33,435 --> 00:53:34,875
Thank you.

1072
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:39,300
Yeah, go for it.

1073
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,321
Hey, this one's for Charlie.

1074
00:53:42,541 --> 00:53:44,902
Yeah.

1075
00:53:45,082 --> 00:53:50,324
Out of curiosity, how did the IP holders actually react,

1076
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:51,044
if at all?

1077
00:53:52,985 --> 00:53:55,306
They were surprisingly, maybe not surprisingly,

1078
00:53:55,326 --> 00:53:57,767
they were very supportive of us during the entire process.

1079
00:53:57,807 --> 00:53:58,167
Obviously.

1080
00:53:58,623 --> 00:54:01,304
It's not something that you ever want to have happen.

1081
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:04,005
But I mean, we've been working with them for years up until that point.

1082
00:54:04,105 --> 00:54:06,566
So, you know, we built up a lot of trust.

1083
00:54:06,946 --> 00:54:09,507
They understood they were abreast of every decision that we'd ultimately made.

1084
00:54:10,387 --> 00:54:13,108
The most important thing was for us to go through and try and recover

1085
00:54:13,228 --> 00:54:14,728
in the long haul as best we ultimately could.

1086
00:54:14,768 --> 00:54:17,249
There's obviously a big investment that we'd all gone through and made in the game.

1087
00:54:17,729 --> 00:54:20,010
So that was always our angle from the get go.

1088
00:54:20,070 --> 00:54:23,991
So we presented our plan to them and they supported it 100 percent.

1089
00:54:24,051 --> 00:54:26,392
So. All right. Thank you. No worries. Thank you.

1090
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:30,931
Hi, this one's for John, I think.

1091
00:54:32,072 --> 00:54:34,975
So I have, I don't really suffer it from myself,

1092
00:54:35,115 --> 00:54:38,157
but I've got a lot of friends who kind of get

1093
00:54:38,197 --> 00:54:40,719
into the same game design habits or game development habits

1094
00:54:40,739 --> 00:54:43,441
where they kind of work from home and they won't leave

1095
00:54:43,481 --> 00:54:45,142
and they get really stuck in their own head

1096
00:54:45,883 --> 00:54:47,324
and every time something goes wrong

1097
00:54:47,724 --> 00:54:50,006
because they're really only working with themselves

1098
00:54:50,046 --> 00:54:51,648
and they're so isolated, you know,

1099
00:54:51,668 --> 00:54:52,889
they really struggle to get over that.

1100
00:54:53,209 --> 00:54:55,671
Do you have any tips on how I can help them

1101
00:54:55,891 --> 00:54:58,153
kind of get out of working from home all the time

1102
00:54:58,790 --> 00:55:01,453
you know, being more with people and kind of helping them

1103
00:55:02,273 --> 00:55:03,795
get out of such a loop, if that makes sense.

1104
00:55:05,056 --> 00:55:05,996
Yeah, that's hard.

1105
00:55:06,417 --> 00:55:06,937
Yeah.

1106
00:55:07,057 --> 00:55:08,759
I've had those people in my life too,

1107
00:55:09,019 --> 00:55:10,540
and I didn't listen to them.

1108
00:55:12,222 --> 00:55:16,185
I think it's a delicate balance, right?

1109
00:55:16,225 --> 00:55:18,647
Because it feels like a natural inclination.

1110
00:55:18,667 --> 00:55:20,949
It feels like a helpful natural inclination

1111
00:55:21,329 --> 00:55:22,991
to reach out when you see someone who's struggling

1112
00:55:23,371 --> 00:55:25,693
and be like, stop doing the things that you're doing.

1113
00:55:26,273 --> 00:55:27,034
They are hurting you.

1114
00:55:28,382 --> 00:55:36,184
But the tough potential problem with that is it can almost make that feeling more entrenched.

1115
00:55:36,684 --> 00:55:40,105
Obviously, it is dependent on anyone's personal struggle.

1116
00:55:42,485 --> 00:55:51,668
I think, I don't know, you can make suggestions, but I wouldn't necessarily push it and pose

1117
00:55:51,688 --> 00:55:57,750
things in a way like, hey, why don't you come join me here and we'll have a workday or something.

1118
00:55:58,034 --> 00:56:02,756
something a little bit more passive that allows them to still have some agency

1119
00:56:02,796 --> 00:56:08,118
without feeling like they're being pulled along or they are, I don't know.

1120
00:56:08,178 --> 00:56:11,720
I feel very apprehensive about actually giving you any concrete example because

1121
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:17,002
again, I don't know, I'm not the guy to do that, but if it were me, I don't know

1122
00:56:17,042 --> 00:56:20,383
that I would want someone to say, get out of the house, you got to do it, it's bad

1123
00:56:20,423 --> 00:56:22,184
for you. I would want them to say, hey

1124
00:56:22,997 --> 00:56:25,919
if you feel like it, please come with me

1125
00:56:25,939 --> 00:56:29,600
and we will work together, or we will do something different

1126
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:31,661
within this space and try and turn that

1127
00:56:31,741 --> 00:56:36,243
into a longer form habit that might result

1128
00:56:36,303 --> 00:56:37,724
in a behavioral change.

1129
00:56:39,884 --> 00:56:45,087
Aside from that, I don't know, just stick around and be

1130
00:56:45,147 --> 00:56:45,667
a good friend.

1131
00:56:45,707 --> 00:56:50,149
I know it's hard, but that, I think, means a lot.

1132
00:56:51,509 --> 00:56:52,090
It does not always.

1133
00:56:53,273 --> 00:56:58,097
feel like you were doing a lot when you were just like being with someone and listening

1134
00:56:58,137 --> 00:57:02,741
to them and accepting whatever they're going through as just a part of their life, but

1135
00:57:02,761 --> 00:57:08,566
I don't think I would have shipped the game if I didn't have people like that for me personally.

1136
00:57:08,646 --> 00:57:13,509
And I don't think shipping the game is the most important thing, but I wouldn't be right

1137
00:57:13,550 --> 00:57:17,373
here where I am right now if I hadn't done this and been able to reflect on it.

1138
00:57:18,092 --> 00:57:19,273
Sorry that's not super helpful.

1139
00:57:19,533 --> 00:57:19,853
That's good.

1140
00:57:20,013 --> 00:57:21,174
I hope it's good.

1141
00:57:21,354 --> 00:57:22,014
Well, thank you so much.

1142
00:57:22,054 --> 00:57:23,295
And yeah, the talks were fantastic.

1143
00:57:23,315 --> 00:57:24,316
So thanks so much for that.

1144
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:25,156
Thank you.

1145
00:57:25,816 --> 00:57:28,037
I'm so sorry they just told us that we're out of time, but we're going to be here.

1146
00:57:28,138 --> 00:57:30,179
So by all means, if you guys have any other questions, feel free to come up.

1147
00:57:30,539 --> 00:57:31,879
Thank you all so much for taking the time.

1148
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,240
Remember to fill out your surveys.
