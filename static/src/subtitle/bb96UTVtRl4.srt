00:00:03,823 --> 00:00:07,625
Hi. So this is actually going to be a very dense talk. It is

2
00:00:07,686 --> 00:00:11,108
about 30 minutes. It may be 31 minutes. So there won't be any

3
00:00:11,148 --> 00:00:14,150
time for questions. If you want to talk to me afterwards, I'll

4
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:18,313
be running over to where the One Life Left podcast is happening

5
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:20,594
and you can come over there and talk to me. I'll also put my

6
00:00:20,774 --> 00:00:22,375
e-mail at the end of the talk.

7
00:00:24,715 --> 00:00:25,716
So thank you for coming out.

8
00:00:26,336 --> 00:00:29,218
I am an artist, game designer, and I guess most importantly,

9
00:00:29,718 --> 00:00:31,579
the writer at New Challenger, and I'm

10
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:33,860
working on a game called Treachery in Beatdown City.

11
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:37,302
But my first job in the games industry

12
00:00:37,342 --> 00:00:38,643
was working at Rockstar Games.

13
00:00:39,363 --> 00:00:40,704
I worked in the production department

14
00:00:40,724 --> 00:00:42,025
for about 4 and 1⁄2 years, which

15
00:00:42,085 --> 00:00:43,305
meant I made a lot of trailers.

16
00:00:43,526 --> 00:00:46,727
And I knew basically all of the writing and cut scenes

17
00:00:46,787 --> 00:00:47,688
backwards and forwards.

18
00:00:48,368 --> 00:00:49,709
I'm also in some games.

19
00:00:51,873 --> 00:00:57,778
I'm in this cut scene audio wise. I am, if it's not really clear, I'm the black boxer who has no

20
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:05,245
facial animation. I'm also this guy who is pretty awesome. He's quoted on a red dead fan

21
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:11,491
Wikipedia as saying you looking to hell it up. That was an interesting role to play. I

22
00:01:11,511 --> 00:01:16,876
basically got grabbed whenever they needed a secondary black voice actor in things.

23
00:01:17,983 --> 00:01:20,145
but I also got to survive to the undead nightmare,

24
00:01:20,165 --> 00:01:21,105
which is kind of rare.

25
00:01:22,886 --> 00:01:24,067
I write a lot of stuff.

26
00:01:24,127 --> 00:01:25,227
I helped write this article.

27
00:01:25,288 --> 00:01:26,968
I think this is a pretty epic article.

28
00:01:27,169 --> 00:01:29,210
Also, Anna Anthropy just told me

29
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:31,051
that she's using this article in her class

30
00:01:31,171 --> 00:01:32,872
that she's teaching, which is pretty amazing

31
00:01:33,572 --> 00:01:35,613
and pretty humbling.

32
00:01:37,174 --> 00:01:39,195
So we're gonna kinda jump into things really quick.

33
00:01:39,495 --> 00:01:40,356
When I talk about...

34
00:01:42,134 --> 00:01:46,598
breaking molds, I actually don't think that these are things set in stone. I think they're

35
00:01:46,618 --> 00:01:51,301
things that are mostly in people's heads. I think it's basically like a lot of well

36
00:01:51,341 --> 00:01:56,905
intentioned ignorance by people who just want to do something good but they just might not

37
00:01:56,986 --> 00:01:57,286
have

38
00:01:58,564 --> 00:02:04,086
enough researcher stuff they think they're doing a good job when they're probably not. So I've

39
00:02:04,106 --> 00:02:09,969
been thinking about how to work my way up to this first way to start breaking these molds but

40
00:02:10,049 --> 00:02:17,072
it's very important to start with this point. The first thing you need to do is end cis,

41
00:02:17,132 --> 00:02:23,755
white, gender, cisgender, able bodied white men as the default in your games. It's kind of

42
00:02:23,815 --> 00:02:27,497
weird. We've all seen this before where we're told they're the most relatable.

43
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:34,244
that people that aren't all of the above aren't. And I've never seen a report where people said

44
00:02:34,284 --> 00:02:40,729
that this is true. So now that I dropped some heaviness, I just want to have a little quiz for

45
00:02:40,749 --> 00:02:50,777
you guys. So this is about relatability and popularity. There is a 90s urban sitcom starring

46
00:02:50,797 --> 00:02:52,358
and named after a well-known comedian.

47
00:02:53,235 --> 00:02:57,216
He has a few friends and a notable nemesis. One friend is a

48
00:02:57,256 --> 00:03:00,257
neighbor who comes over and takes food. Another friend is

49
00:03:00,337 --> 00:03:04,238
bald, wears glasses and has job problems. And in one episode the

50
00:03:04,258 --> 00:03:06,698
main character's apartment is robbed and he contemplates

51
00:03:06,778 --> 00:03:10,659
leaving. This show is very popular for its time slot. Does

52
00:03:10,699 --> 00:03:16,760
anybody have any guesses? Just blurt it out. Martin is the

53
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,360
correct answer.

54
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:21,142
I can forgive you for maybe thinking Seinfeld, but no.

55
00:03:22,363 --> 00:03:26,165
So now that we talk about this, a lot of the stories that we

56
00:03:26,225 --> 00:03:28,606
have and the set-ups can be read multiple ways.

57
00:03:28,946 --> 00:03:31,908
And it's really up to the creators to fill in the blanks.

58
00:03:32,228 --> 00:03:35,310
None of the basic set-up for Martin or Seinfeld call for

59
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:36,631
anybody in particular.

60
00:03:38,821 --> 00:03:41,442
So we've seen these images a lot often with different

61
00:03:41,482 --> 00:03:44,163
configurations of white dudes that sometimes randomly throws

62
00:03:44,203 --> 00:03:46,785
the prince of Persia in there because people, again, make

63
00:03:46,865 --> 00:03:49,246
images that still they don't even know. They just assume all

64
00:03:49,266 --> 00:03:54,248
the white characters are just in everything. And it's kind of

65
00:03:54,288 --> 00:03:57,389
weird because these characters often play a big helping of

66
00:03:57,429 --> 00:04:01,211
generic archetypes, right? It's like sad, depressed dad, angry

67
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:05,373
war guy. The guy who is supposed to be Nathan Drake but with less

68
00:04:05,393 --> 00:04:07,334
of a budget and a completely different genre.

69
00:04:08,216 --> 00:04:12,543
and a much worse script that was written in half the time, but hey, Nolan North is playing the

70
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:19,212
character. I feel most of these characters aren't that interesting, not in and of themselves, and a

71
00:04:19,252 --> 00:04:20,634
hell of a lot of them look like each other.

72
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:27,135
and if we remove characters driven by white imperialism like Drake who's destiny is to steal

73
00:04:27,155 --> 00:04:32,099
from cultures and destroy stuff while doing it. Max Payne who murders hundreds of Brazilians

74
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:37,064
under orders of other lighter skinned Brazilians and Michael from GTA 5 who's a rich guy

75
00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:42,448
complaining about his life and gets in trouble because his inflated ego tells him he can do

76
00:04:42,468 --> 00:04:45,611
whatever he wants all the while dragging a black guy along for the ride.

77
00:04:46,231 --> 00:04:51,193
If you get rid of them, you're basically left with this. In my opinion, of course. What we have

78
00:04:51,273 --> 00:04:56,536
are these three guys who are all made by Japanese developers. Frank West is a critique of

79
00:04:56,596 --> 00:05:01,938
journalism in a game that is a critique of the U.S. beef industry. Francis York Morgan is a

80
00:05:01,978 --> 00:05:08,961
really interesting ode to Twin Peaks. And Naked Snake is a man who is decidedly anti-imperialist

81
00:05:09,021 --> 00:05:12,763
and hates the government and decides to set up his own military base in Africa.

82
00:05:15,067 --> 00:05:19,582
So I just want to talk about like none of these characters are

83
00:05:19,683 --> 00:05:21,971
interesting by default. I'm just going to go back for a second.

84
00:05:23,501 --> 00:05:30,062
And my argument isn't really to just stop making white protagonists, it's just that you need to get rid of that as your default in your head.

85
00:05:30,443 --> 00:05:36,184
You have to really start working really hard to justify why you have to make a dude who's white.

86
00:05:36,764 --> 00:05:41,285
And if you take those steps to actually really justify why you're doing that,

87
00:05:41,705 --> 00:05:47,647
then hopefully you will make a character that will be a lot better and won't just start murdering a bunch of brown people just for the heck of it.

88
00:05:49,043 --> 00:05:55,245
So you have to really think, why is the nihilist, often sexist, sometimes mildly or overtly

89
00:05:55,305 --> 00:06:01,128
racist, manipulative, grumpy, snarky, imperialist character relatable to players? The lengths

90
00:06:01,168 --> 00:06:06,631
that people go to make the case for these characters is often very ridiculous. So case in

91
00:06:06,651 --> 00:06:14,634
point, we all remember the ghostbusters, but wasn't there a fourth one? There he is. So Ernie

92
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:16,335
Hudson was actually interviewed recently.

93
00:06:16,874 --> 00:06:18,355
I'm going to read you a bit of this interview.

94
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:23,700
When I originally got the script, the character of Winston was amazing and I thought it would

95
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,661
be career changing.

96
00:06:24,781 --> 00:06:29,545
The character came in right at the beginning of the movie and had an elaborate background.

97
00:06:29,886 --> 00:06:33,089
He was an Air Force major or something, a demolitions guy.

98
00:06:33,229 --> 00:06:33,709
It was great.

99
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:38,793
The night before filming begins, however, I get this new script and it was shocking. The

100
00:06:38,813 --> 00:06:44,217
character came in at page 68 after the Ghostbusters were established. His elaborate

101
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:49,101
background was all gone, replaced by me walking in and saying, if there's a steady

102
00:06:49,141 --> 00:06:55,847
paycheck, I'll believe anything you say. And so basically he panics, he can't sleep, he

103
00:06:55,867 --> 00:06:58,929
goes and talks to the people and he's like, what happened? And they're like, we wanted to

104
00:06:58,969 --> 00:07:00,390
give Bill Murray more stuff to do.

105
00:07:01,774 --> 00:07:03,395
And what did they give Bill Murray to do?

106
00:07:04,336 --> 00:07:06,838
He basically is the loser jock lovable sexist trope

107
00:07:06,878 --> 00:07:07,398
from the 80s.

108
00:07:07,758 --> 00:07:09,740
He's the worst of the three scientists.

109
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,762
He doesn't care about his job.

110
00:07:12,402 --> 00:07:14,604
He tortures a guy with electroshock therapy

111
00:07:14,664 --> 00:07:16,265
basically because he wants to sleep

112
00:07:16,285 --> 00:07:17,606
with the woman on the right.

113
00:07:18,656 --> 00:07:24,458
He stalks her. He basically feigns interest in her because he also wants to sleep with her. He

114
00:07:24,498 --> 00:07:29,480
goes to her job and waits for her. He also goes into her house under false pretenses because he

115
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,201
actually doesn't know anything about ghost busting. So he goes to her house, doesn't listen

116
00:07:33,221 --> 00:07:35,442
to any of her problems and just wants to nail her.

117
00:07:36,662 --> 00:07:44,248
and then they kiss and have a baby just in time for the second movie. So Ernie Hudson talks

118
00:07:44,308 --> 00:07:51,453
about this and he says, you know, we talk about every man characters in games and this is what

119
00:07:51,493 --> 00:07:56,437
Ernie Hudson had to say what people think about Winston. Well, he's sort of an every man. This

120
00:07:56,457 --> 00:08:00,280
is what people say. He's kind of the guy who helps the audience understand.

121
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,840
And then Ernie says, I love the character, and he's got some

122
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,421
great lines, but I felt like he was just kind of there.

123
00:08:06,801 --> 00:08:08,982
And ironically, this is what games writers use when talking

124
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:11,702
about why they make these white dudes the main character.

125
00:08:12,422 --> 00:08:14,683
What the audience sees in Winston is a mostly

126
00:08:14,823 --> 00:08:16,383
apolitical shell of a person.

127
00:08:17,043 --> 00:08:17,624
And every man.

128
00:08:20,564 --> 00:08:22,765
Now I want to talk about this game, talk about The Last of

129
00:08:22,845 --> 00:08:25,745
Us, people were really happy about Ellie's existence, and

130
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:26,726
they should be.

131
00:08:27,366 --> 00:08:29,726
And they were also very happy with the DLC.

132
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:36,028
But I think like what if Ellie was the main character, you know, instead of grizzled Joe Joel

133
00:08:37,072 --> 00:08:43,053
And it's really weird because when you're Grizzle Joel in just the game mechanics, Ellie is an

134
00:08:43,113 --> 00:08:48,294
invincible character that just runs around with an AI that actually can't kill her. So then the

135
00:08:48,334 --> 00:08:53,035
whole story of him being a protector doesn't actually work because you can watch the AI just

136
00:08:53,055 --> 00:08:59,577
like try to hit her and nothing happens. But also, Ellie is in the subordinate role and Joel is in

137
00:08:59,597 --> 00:09:05,598
the main role, but what if Riley was in the main role and Joel was in the subordinate role? Now

138
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:12,943
Like, if you were Riley and you were maybe the character that needed to be protected

139
00:09:12,983 --> 00:09:16,726
or whatever, but you could also give out orders to the person who's supposed to be protecting

140
00:09:16,766 --> 00:09:22,110
you and then you have to worry about getting hurt all the while not being a grizzled dude

141
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:26,033
but actually being a queer black girl starring in a game, that would be pretty awesome and

142
00:09:26,073 --> 00:09:27,774
it actually doesn't take that much work.

143
00:09:28,555 --> 00:09:32,598
As writers, if you were to take the stand on this grand stage of AAA.

144
00:09:33,794 --> 00:09:38,217
you would make the games industry better for it. Who better than one of the biggest studios

145
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:45,502
also to make that the standard? Who is more protected and if they aren't doing it, who can?

146
00:09:49,264 --> 00:09:55,148
So more steps. Be specific about your characters, be detailed and be deliberate.

147
00:09:56,241 --> 00:10:00,803
So now that we've started with a blank slate for who your default characters are, you should

148
00:10:00,883 --> 00:10:05,226
work on making your characters that are unique and very explicit in who they are. This might

149
00:10:05,246 --> 00:10:10,809
kind of sound obvious, but even in a text light game, you can create compelling characters by

150
00:10:10,869 --> 00:10:14,931
choosing a few explicit character traits and having a few choice quotes that explain who

151
00:10:14,971 --> 00:10:15,671
your character is.

152
00:10:16,392 --> 00:10:18,936
In general, being deliberate is also very important.

153
00:10:19,297 --> 00:10:21,260
So when I started working on Treachery in Beatdown City,

154
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,583
my goal was to make the fighting game characters

155
00:10:23,603 --> 00:10:25,166
that I'd love to see in one.

156
00:10:25,707 --> 00:10:26,668
So these are my characters.

157
00:10:26,908 --> 00:10:29,913
Bruce on the left is a black man born of a Jamaican family.

158
00:10:30,545 --> 00:10:31,505
who is a millionaire.

159
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:32,886
He grew up in the projects.

160
00:10:32,926 --> 00:10:35,647
His family was good friends with the local Chinese family

161
00:10:36,027 --> 00:10:37,728
and got a lot of his sensibilities,

162
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:40,510
like his love of anime, from that relationship.

163
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,511
He's always been exceptional in math,

164
00:10:42,611 --> 00:10:44,071
so he skyrocketed in school

165
00:10:44,451 --> 00:10:47,453
and was able to use his instincts in the stock market.

166
00:10:47,953 --> 00:10:50,074
He loves Capoeira and Jeet Kune Do.

167
00:10:50,194 --> 00:10:53,636
A lot of these details are fueled by people that I know.

168
00:10:54,516 --> 00:10:55,977
Like one of my best friends is Chinese.

169
00:10:55,997 --> 00:10:57,458
I learned about anime from him.

170
00:10:58,714 --> 00:11:02,995
Lisa, to the right, is a Puerto Rican woman who has always been middle class.

171
00:11:03,235 --> 00:11:04,695
She's in the police academy.

172
00:11:05,316 --> 00:11:09,117
She's taking after her dad because he kind of really wants her to do that, but she just

173
00:11:09,177 --> 00:11:15,679
wants to be a forensic scientist, and she really wants to be an MMA champion, and she

174
00:11:15,739 --> 00:11:19,380
fights in a lot of underground fights that end up sometimes getting broken up by the

175
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,360
police, ironically.

176
00:11:21,696 --> 00:11:26,498
Brad, in the middle, is a Texas-born man of royal Spanish and Mexican indigenous descent

177
00:11:26,778 --> 00:11:30,901
whose family had to flee Mexico into America, therefore they are illegal.

178
00:11:31,574 --> 00:11:36,119
When he was younger he was an independent wrestler until being called up to the big leagues where

179
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,905
falling out over his family's heritage made him lose his job and his title.

180
00:11:41,365 --> 00:11:47,031
And now he works as a community center worker helping the poor. He's a wrestler and is very

181
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:50,996
sensitive about it being called fake, which Lisa does often to mess with him,

182
00:11:51,396 --> 00:11:52,658
but she also really looks up to him.

183
00:11:54,140 --> 00:12:00,802
So there's also issues. So beyond the heroes that I worked on, making the enemies have a very

184
00:12:00,862 --> 00:12:06,683
distinct variety of characteristics of varying genders and racial, ethnic and socioeconomic

185
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:12,285
backgrounds. Every character has one page to describe who they are. This helps me not only

186
00:12:12,325 --> 00:12:17,726
write their dialogue but know what neighborhoods they should be in, what it means to not be in

187
00:12:17,766 --> 00:12:20,807
that neighborhood, who their preferred people to hang out with are.

188
00:12:21,687 --> 00:12:23,687
Why would the cops come to help them?

189
00:12:23,727 --> 00:12:25,288
Will the cops fight alongside them?

190
00:12:25,928 --> 00:12:27,469
It makes some very interesting encounters

191
00:12:27,609 --> 00:12:29,230
that leads into the gameplay,

192
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,710
like what happens when a punk is hanging out

193
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:33,211
with a local bar socialite.

194
00:12:34,492 --> 00:12:36,192
It's been a very monstrous task, actually.

195
00:12:36,212 --> 00:12:37,693
I've been working on this for a very long time,

196
00:12:37,713 --> 00:12:39,333
and I know none of the characters are perfect,

197
00:12:39,433 --> 00:12:44,315
but the effort put in creates very satisfying dialogue

198
00:12:44,355 --> 00:12:45,556
in the game overall.

199
00:12:46,588 --> 00:12:51,836
So now talking about maybe missing out on specifics, this is Cole from Gears of War.

200
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:57,593
and I want to talk about him for a little bit. So just bear with me a little bit. These next

201
00:12:57,633 --> 00:13:02,897
two clips are going to be kind of interesting. So Coltrane is a mainstay of Gears of War and

202
00:13:02,937 --> 00:13:07,260
he was based on a character named Terry Tate who was in some Rebot commercials and it's an

203
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:13,625
actor playing a football player. And he was voiced by this guy Lester Spate. And so that

204
00:13:13,665 --> 00:13:17,728
sounds kind of cool, right? They're being influenced by other media. So this is Terry Tate.

205
00:13:26,617 --> 00:13:28,318
Hey Laura. Hey Paul.

206
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:37,064
Well that's not Terry Tate.

207
00:13:37,104 --> 00:13:39,605
Hey buddy.

208
00:13:39,725 --> 00:13:43,768
Woo! You know you can't bring that weak ass stuff up in this humpy bumpy.

209
00:13:43,988 --> 00:13:47,130
You killed it Joe. You made some money. You know that baby.

210
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:50,092
Else you here for a long day. A long day.

211
00:13:50,352 --> 00:13:53,354
Cause Triple T's up in this bitch!

212
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:03,201
Some people said I was crazy when I brought Terry on board,

213
00:14:03,662 --> 00:14:05,562
but I'm a firm proponent of paradigm breaking,

214
00:14:06,062 --> 00:14:07,062
outside the box thinking.

215
00:14:07,922 --> 00:14:09,163
And, since Terry's been with us,

216
00:14:09,543 --> 00:14:10,823
our productivity has gone up 46%.

217
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,123
Ha ha ha ha!

218
00:14:14,464 --> 00:14:16,364
Break was over 15 minutes ago!

219
00:14:16,744 --> 00:14:18,945
Bitch, I am an enforcer, man!

220
00:14:19,345 --> 00:14:21,005
Don't nothing go down in my house.

221
00:14:21,365 --> 00:14:22,805
It's 100% hard, baby.

222
00:14:23,386 --> 00:14:24,606
Sure, I jack a few fools.

223
00:14:24,926 --> 00:14:25,906
I give them the pain.

224
00:14:26,346 --> 00:14:28,247
But sometimes it's about intimidation, you know.

225
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:30,533
It's mind games.

226
00:14:31,193 --> 00:14:33,354
So, all right, I'll see you later.

227
00:14:33,374 --> 00:14:34,814
Ah!

228
00:14:34,914 --> 00:14:39,075
St. Fraser, St. Fraser!

229
00:14:39,195 --> 00:14:41,035
Get ready for the pain, woman!

230
00:14:41,235 --> 00:14:42,495
The pain, take cover!

231
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:43,436
Oh no!

232
00:14:43,976 --> 00:14:44,516
Oh no!

233
00:14:44,596 --> 00:14:46,056
Oh no, I got it!

234
00:14:46,596 --> 00:14:48,116
It's the man, please don't hurt me!

235
00:14:48,176 --> 00:14:49,237
Please don't hurt me!

236
00:14:50,417 --> 00:14:52,117
Thank you, Terry!

237
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:53,658
Thank you, God!

238
00:14:54,178 --> 00:14:54,318
Ah!

239
00:14:54,538 --> 00:14:55,618
But what's really impressed me

240
00:14:56,098 --> 00:14:58,238
is how Terry's become part of the Felcher family.

241
00:14:58,925 --> 00:14:59,825
He fits right in here.

242
00:14:59,985 --> 00:15:01,406
Surprise, kid!

243
00:15:01,687 --> 00:15:03,348
Happy birthday!

244
00:15:04,829 --> 00:15:04,929
Woo!

245
00:15:04,949 --> 00:15:08,311
As profits increase, the margin reaches a second break-even point here,

246
00:15:09,032 --> 00:15:10,893
after which enterprise falls into loss.

247
00:15:11,754 --> 00:15:12,334
Any questions?

248
00:15:13,515 --> 00:15:16,477
So now look at his video game counterpart.

249
00:15:17,297 --> 00:15:19,199
Jack, plug in and see what you can find.

250
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:26,564
We cannot allow the Lumbers to pollute the surface.

251
00:15:26,584 --> 00:15:27,765
We must bury their infection here.

252
00:15:30,315 --> 00:15:33,017
The world is rightfully ours!

253
00:15:33,377 --> 00:15:35,158
Delta Squad is in your house, bitch!

254
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:36,459
You hear that shit?

255
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,061
You grimy ass bitches are going down!

256
00:15:39,321 --> 00:15:41,322
Like way down! Get it down!

257
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:43,624
Show down, you ain't gonna even know what's where, cop!

258
00:15:44,324 --> 00:15:45,565
Your ass is gonna be clapped!

259
00:15:45,585 --> 00:15:46,986
So yeah, that's enough of that.

260
00:15:49,127 --> 00:15:50,048
So it's interesting, right?

261
00:15:51,466 --> 00:15:53,447
So Cliff Bleszinski is quoted as saying,

262
00:15:53,767 --> 00:15:57,369
those of you citing Cole as a bad stereotype, guys,

263
00:15:57,409 --> 00:15:58,830
that's just Lester being Lester.

264
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,711
But if you look at the two characters,

265
00:16:00,871 --> 00:16:04,893
in two minutes, Terry Tate is developed way more than Cole,

266
00:16:04,953 --> 00:16:06,854
who took about three games to get to that point.

267
00:16:07,735 --> 00:16:10,216
To get to anywhere plausible of not just being

268
00:16:10,256 --> 00:16:11,457
a cartoonish black person.

269
00:16:14,221 --> 00:16:18,504
When you look at Terry Tate, he is a part of office culture, throwing birthday parties.

270
00:16:18,584 --> 00:16:23,548
He is valued as a team member for his intelligence, which can be seen by him performing presentations.

271
00:16:23,668 --> 00:16:29,793
And yes, he tackles people because he has to uphold civility in an often apathetic and thoughtless office world,

272
00:16:29,873 --> 00:16:32,094
which lacks basic decency most of the time.

273
00:16:33,015 --> 00:16:37,997
he works because you wish you were him or you wish somebody like him was around. This is why

274
00:16:38,037 --> 00:16:42,679
the comedy works. And this was also not the first version of the commercial. They aired one

275
00:16:42,699 --> 00:16:46,701
during the Super Bowl which was a lot more tackle heavy. So obviously they thought about his

276
00:16:46,721 --> 00:16:51,483
character and they wanted to develop him further. Whereas that's about two minutes to

277
00:16:51,503 --> 00:16:56,385
develop his character. Whereas Cole took two games which is about saying waiting for two

278
00:16:56,665 --> 00:16:59,626
full seasons of a TV show. It's like two ten hour games.

279
00:17:00,407 --> 00:17:06,251
And so this kind of bleeds into like Luther with Key and Peel, Obama's anger translator.

280
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:12,475
Luther's job is to express the pent-up feelings of the president. He is less articulate and

281
00:17:12,556 --> 00:17:19,661
jumping and shouting, but the skit these behaviors are about are not who he is as a person,

282
00:17:20,121 --> 00:17:25,745
they are what he is paid to articulate. He is an actor playing an actor. This can be seen when

283
00:17:25,785 --> 00:17:28,367
he either says something the president didn't mean to say,

284
00:17:29,337 --> 00:17:32,858
or when he backs off of the actual president in real life.

285
00:17:33,659 --> 00:17:36,480
This is why this skit works really well, because he's a

286
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:41,802
paid actor. And then they also went to the length of going in

287
00:17:41,842 --> 00:17:45,464
real life to flip the situation. It's pretty interesting. So I

288
00:17:45,484 --> 00:17:47,785
just want to, you know, speaking about specifics, this is

289
00:17:47,825 --> 00:17:50,586
Clementine from the walking dead. This is her parents. She's

290
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:53,047
black. No question about it. I will be talking about this

291
00:17:53,148 --> 00:17:53,408
later.

292
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:57,010
So give your character a world view,

293
00:17:57,411 --> 00:17:58,991
give your character player world views,

294
00:17:59,031 --> 00:18:00,231
that's really important because

295
00:18:00,251 --> 00:18:03,552
it might seem kind of obvious,

296
00:18:03,652 --> 00:18:05,513
but player characters world views

297
00:18:05,533 --> 00:18:07,214
should be reflected by the world around them

298
00:18:07,274 --> 00:18:09,174
without them having to speak for all people.

299
00:18:09,414 --> 00:18:10,475
That's also very important.

300
00:18:10,555 --> 00:18:12,475
This calls back to focusing on being specific.

301
00:18:13,156 --> 00:18:19,804
Lincoln Clay, I like bits of Mafia 3, I think overall it's pretty decent, but I can't get over

302
00:18:19,824 --> 00:18:24,449
the fact that he's very apolitical, and aside from a small handful of missions where he's like

303
00:18:24,629 --> 00:18:31,197
real mad at really overt racism, like the KKK, he's very in the middle about his feelings. I

304
00:18:31,237 --> 00:18:33,119
mean, I feel like he's basically John Cena.

305
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:38,461
His beliefs are hustle, loyalty, and respect, and he won't kill women.

306
00:18:38,882 --> 00:18:40,903
Those are his only scruples in life.

307
00:18:41,723 --> 00:18:45,446
And this is pretty weird because as a black man in the South in the 60s,

308
00:18:46,687 --> 00:18:48,648
he seems he should be a lot angrier.

309
00:18:48,908 --> 00:18:51,790
And the fact that he doesn't reminisce enough about, you know,

310
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:54,952
like being in the war that he was just transpired, he doesn't have PTSD.

311
00:18:55,712 --> 00:19:00,477
It's like he forgot everything that's going on. He's essentially not a person. He's just a

312
00:19:00,537 --> 00:19:05,481
shell of the players to use. He's the eventual black man who murders and feels no remorse,

313
00:19:05,641 --> 00:19:12,828
which is a big problem. See, he has a good time, right? No PTSD here. Seemingly unbothered by

314
00:19:12,848 --> 00:19:16,912
the current state of the U.S. mostly. And he's so happy when he's with these people. I

315
00:19:16,992 --> 00:19:21,896
actually really wish there were more scenes about this because in this game they basically

316
00:19:23,157 --> 00:19:27,282
This is what I would like to do in the game. That's all I want to do the whole time. And I

317
00:19:27,342 --> 00:19:32,748
think that's what Lincoln, that should have been his first thing to do. Go kill all the KKK. But

318
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:39,176
the first thing he does is kill a bunch of black people, which is kind of weird. The thing is go

319
00:19:39,216 --> 00:19:40,517
kill the Haitians. That's the mission.

320
00:19:41,871 --> 00:19:43,593
which we heard about in another game a long time ago,

321
00:19:43,633 --> 00:19:44,994
that seemed to spark controversy

322
00:19:45,014 --> 00:19:47,196
and now it sparked zero controversy.

323
00:19:47,837 --> 00:19:50,219
And it's kind of weird because the player doesn't ask

324
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:51,581
a goddamn question about this

325
00:19:51,641 --> 00:19:53,242
because he's just a classic puppet

326
00:19:53,262 --> 00:19:54,303
for the player to inhabit.

327
00:19:54,864 --> 00:19:55,965
He's a shell of a black man.

328
00:19:57,008 --> 00:20:01,229
And then there's the issue where his best friend, he's actually really interesting. I like this

329
00:20:01,269 --> 00:20:06,671
dude a lot. But he's the classic white nihilist angry dude who's the driver of the story.

330
00:20:06,751 --> 00:20:12,113
There's even like an extra after credits bit with him which is kind of interesting. He's

331
00:20:12,193 --> 00:20:17,195
basically the main character. And that's really weird because if you're making a story about a

332
00:20:17,335 --> 00:20:22,777
black dude and then you define him by a white guy, that's a little weird. Also, like...

333
00:20:23,496 --> 00:20:26,928
And speaking about, like, I don't expect, like, Lincoln Clay to speak for all people.

334
00:20:26,968 --> 00:20:28,213
That's not my issue with it.

335
00:20:29,148 --> 00:20:35,011
My issue is that Luke Cage on Netflix stars a guy who a lot of people like, a lot of people

336
00:20:35,051 --> 00:20:39,553
who watch the show like, but he's actually a pretty conservative dude and he's the hero. He

337
00:20:39,593 --> 00:20:44,675
doesn't like young people's culture. He thinks they're uncivilized. He constantly critiques

338
00:20:44,695 --> 00:20:49,377
people. A lot of people watching it would probably disagree with his political views, but

339
00:20:49,437 --> 00:20:53,679
because he's a black dude who reflects bullets and can just fight the cops, people like him.

340
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,001
Method Man is a fan of him on the show and it's actually one of the most beautiful things

341
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:57,401
I've seen.

342
00:20:58,234 --> 00:21:05,927
So speaking about this, we need more than two, more than two, not just two people in important

343
00:21:05,987 --> 00:21:11,737
roles in a game of marginalized descent. Because one of the key things is we are not a monolith.

344
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:14,648
So there's this show, A Different World.

345
00:21:15,328 --> 00:21:16,149
It was an amazing show.

346
00:21:16,209 --> 00:21:18,972
It stars, it kind of stars over the time,

347
00:21:19,433 --> 00:21:20,614
this guy Dwayne Wayne.

348
00:21:21,214 --> 00:21:23,357
He actually starts in the first episode,

349
00:21:23,457 --> 00:21:25,679
he's in the women's dorm room,

350
00:21:26,099 --> 00:21:27,961
kind of just harassing all the women.

351
00:21:28,122 --> 00:21:29,283
And it's not a good look,

352
00:21:29,343 --> 00:21:31,385
but actually what happens five seconds after that,

353
00:21:31,405 --> 00:21:33,127
he gets thrown out of the women's dorm room

354
00:21:33,147 --> 00:21:34,749
and you don't see him for five episodes.

355
00:21:35,389 --> 00:21:41,831
and the show switches to focus on a group of disparate black and white women and their problems.

356
00:21:42,351 --> 00:21:46,992
And that's pretty interesting because the show for the whole, even though they open,

357
00:21:47,052 --> 00:21:50,694
like the shot is actually Dwayne Wayne looking at the camera, talking to the camera,

358
00:21:50,774 --> 00:21:57,515
and he's not the main character. And he's actually brought back to run for Mr. Tillman

359
00:21:57,656 --> 00:22:00,056
in a lone man running in a beauty pageant, which...

360
00:22:02,536 --> 00:22:08,058
Everyone tries to like, heckle him, and it's interesting because like, women are barking at him, whistling at him,

361
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:14,380
to basically pay him back for all of the sexist comments and behavior he's had, and he owns it,

362
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:19,442
and he says, I deserve that, but also we all need to look at each other because we should all stop doing this.

363
00:22:20,962 --> 00:22:28,029
the show eventually shifts to him and he ends up, he's like a math whiz, he got a perfect score on

364
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:32,774
his SAT and he uses that as part of his pick up lines and he eventually graduates as top of the

365
00:22:32,794 --> 00:22:35,337
class and becomes a game developer. Who knew?

366
00:22:37,296 --> 00:22:42,840
So quick story. This is fast and furious series. This is Tej. He is a hacker and a technical

367
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:48,263
expert. He's been in the series up to eight now or whatever next year. I love the movies. He's

368
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:53,386
been doing it for a while. This is Roman Pierce. Roman Pierce represents toxic masculinity of

369
00:22:53,426 --> 00:22:58,449
the group. He's also kind of a coward and everyone makes fun of him for it. The two of them

370
00:22:58,489 --> 00:23:03,893
are very opposed and they along with everybody else have to go rescue a hacker named Ramsey.

371
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:11,442
No one knows who Ramsey is. We only know that they're on this bus. When they rescue Ramsey,

372
00:23:11,842 --> 00:23:17,566
Ramsey is an attractive black woman. And Ludacris just falls in love. He's like, wow, you

373
00:23:17,806 --> 00:23:22,509
hack, you're way better than me in everything. I just want to get to know you. And Tyrese just

374
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:29,874
wants to ogle her and is like, that's not what hackers look like. And Tej's response is, what

375
00:23:29,914 --> 00:23:33,476
do hackers look like? So basically what we have ‑‑

376
00:23:34,894 --> 00:23:38,478
is you have a very short, concise discussion with two black men that has checks and

377
00:23:38,518 --> 00:23:43,765
balances and tackles the social norms of hackers and programs, what programmers are,

378
00:23:43,785 --> 00:23:47,470
end scene. Stop murdering us to follow the plot.

379
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:53,207
for their plot. So this is watch dogs 2 which I think is interesting. It stars a black guy and

380
00:23:53,227 --> 00:23:57,730
everyone wants to clap for it. I like Marcus. I think he's cool but who else is in this game?

381
00:23:58,031 --> 00:24:03,395
We have dead mouse and cool lady on the side who is actually very cool. And then here's

382
00:24:03,435 --> 00:24:10,160
another key art. We add green hoody dude. You know, a sign of greatness. Then we have Rob

383
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:14,723
zombie added to the group. And I kept hearing about this black person on the dead sec team.

384
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:22,578
Here he is. It's actually really hard to find key art for him because of a lot of things. He

385
00:24:22,618 --> 00:24:26,261
exists basically to walk around in one mission with Marcus to allow him to have a

386
00:24:26,301 --> 00:24:30,865
conversation about racism which is weird because him being used as a stand in to do this is

387
00:24:30,965 --> 00:24:33,387
racist. And then he's dead.

388
00:24:35,237 --> 00:24:38,378
immediately after talking about racism in tech, the only other

389
00:24:38,398 --> 00:24:41,359
black person on the team is killed. His death doesn't

390
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:44,800
matter. His life didn't matter. He is a one dimensional

391
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:49,902
character basically there to be deus ex blackina. He is murdered

392
00:24:49,922 --> 00:24:53,384
by this gang. This gang is a less than one dimensional

393
00:24:53,424 --> 00:24:56,305
Mexican gang that is basically just there to be the bad Mexican

394
00:24:56,325 --> 00:24:59,166
gang. Don't do that. You can't just write a black character and

395
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:01,487
then just throw every other minority under the bus.

396
00:25:04,144 --> 00:25:09,727
So, but they really do build up this dude. They build up daft punk all the way. And, you know,

397
00:25:09,848 --> 00:25:13,690
it's really weird because, like, he's not that interesting. Like, they just want you to, like,

398
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:17,833
he's a lonely dude, he's a hacker, he wears a mask. That's basically who he is, but they keep

399
00:25:18,013 --> 00:25:24,038
putting him in missions. And it's like, why is he white? I don't know. Like, but they keep

400
00:25:24,158 --> 00:25:28,481
putting you into these missions, so they probably should have just killed him. And

401
00:25:30,557 --> 00:25:32,598
would have killed him, a guy you have been spending a lot of

402
00:25:32,618 --> 00:25:35,620
time with, that would have been awesome. But what if they rewrote

403
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:39,903
him as being a Mexican guy who is also in tech and he is

404
00:25:39,963 --> 00:25:42,364
talking to you and he is like man, I'm a brown person too.

405
00:25:42,404 --> 00:25:45,706
That's really awesome. We are in tech and he likes this mask

406
00:25:45,746 --> 00:25:48,688
because he is really big into lucha libre. And in lucha libre

407
00:25:48,708 --> 00:25:50,769
you basically wear your mask until you die.

408
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:56,055
Then you kill that dude that you spent like 10 hours building up and you really care.

409
00:25:56,595 --> 00:25:58,658
Instead of just killing the one dimensional black dude.

410
00:25:58,778 --> 00:26:01,701
And then you bury him in his mask like you would a luchador.

411
00:26:01,721 --> 00:26:05,285
Like El Santo who's on the left only showed his face once in public.

412
00:26:06,046 --> 00:26:07,007
And it was right before he died.

413
00:26:08,329 --> 00:26:11,673
Avoid defining your characters by trauma and oppression.

414
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,861
In story, I actually, this is a bit of a story about me.

415
00:26:16,962 --> 00:26:19,102
I had this problem where I'm writing these characters

416
00:26:19,462 --> 00:26:21,503
for the game and I'm trying to do something like

417
00:26:21,543 --> 00:26:24,444
about New York and it deals with fights that come from

418
00:26:24,544 --> 00:26:27,184
like wrong headed conversations occasionally

419
00:26:27,465 --> 00:26:32,106
and I defined my characters in ways where I kind of made

420
00:26:32,166 --> 00:26:34,587
the white characters symbols of gentrification

421
00:26:34,867 --> 00:26:37,667
and the black characters and other brown characters

422
00:26:37,787 --> 00:26:40,728
as symbols of hood mentality and that basically

423
00:26:41,369 --> 00:26:46,590
split them up into like people of different economic statuses and social statuses and

424
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:48,210
That's really bad

425
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:53,052
and it's like if you define somebody by being poor or being harassed or being

426
00:26:53,452 --> 00:26:59,833
Brown and the way people treat them then you're just robbing them of their agency and I was doing this and I finally sat down

427
00:27:00,334 --> 00:27:04,695
And I basically took all the characters. I did a review of all of them. I compared them to each other

428
00:27:04,755 --> 00:27:08,956
I compared them to the world that I expected them to be in which is fictional futurism

429
00:27:09,736 --> 00:27:14,217
I decided to stop and change and go in a different direction. I kind of took parts from

430
00:27:14,237 --> 00:27:21,260
everybody and made them all a little deeper. So getting deeper. I want to just bring up this

431
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:27,201
show, Amen. It's a very interesting show which is about a pastor in Philadelphia and he wants

432
00:27:27,241 --> 00:27:30,062
to keep everything in his church firmly under his control.

433
00:27:31,187 --> 00:27:36,168
And so we learn a lot from this intro. He just gets out of his car, plays double dutch, gives

434
00:27:36,208 --> 00:27:41,470
everyone dap on the way in. And he's got swagger. And the interesting thing is he was actually

435
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:46,632
created by this dude on the right, Ed Weinberger. He's the only son of a Jewish butcher. They are

436
00:27:46,672 --> 00:27:47,552
very different people.

437
00:27:48,092 --> 00:27:52,937
He got his start writing jokes for the comedian Dick Gregory and he would tour with him during

438
00:27:53,017 --> 00:27:55,199
the civil rights era so he kind of learned a lot.

439
00:27:55,539 --> 00:27:59,403
And he basically says that working for Dick Gregory is why he is successful.

440
00:27:59,463 --> 00:28:03,046
He has founded numerous shows, co-created numerous shows like Taxi.

441
00:28:03,907 --> 00:28:08,431
And that's what I'm trying to say is that if you want to be great at what you're doing,

442
00:28:09,132 --> 00:28:10,253
you basically have to

443
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:16,564
this guy would drive around this dude. This was his first job. He would do odd jobs for a

444
00:28:16,624 --> 00:28:21,308
comedian who was way better than him to learn everything that he could. And then he went on to

445
00:28:21,368 --> 00:28:27,453
write shows about black people and everybody else. And also, I don't want to go without

446
00:28:27,513 --> 00:28:32,217
talking about Robert Townsend who is on the back, on the side. He made Hollywood Shuffle which

447
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:37,982
is an amazing movie about how black people are treated in media. So one more quiz.

448
00:28:39,715 --> 00:28:45,539
There's a show about a bunch of friends. It's another urban sitcom. One of the friends could be

449
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:51,503
called quirky and some of the friends sleep with each other. This show was also very popular. Any

450
00:28:51,884 --> 00:29:01,691
guesses? Living single. Not friends. Friends was based on living single. So I guess I don't

451
00:29:01,731 --> 00:29:03,712
have much time so I'm going to just...

452
00:29:05,238 --> 00:29:10,481
quickly. I actually have no time. So I'm just going to end on this. Don't stub in replacements.

453
00:29:12,002 --> 00:29:17,465
MLK and Malcolm X are not the same as Charles Xavier and Magneto even though Marvel wants

454
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:22,428
to tell you that Magneto is based on Malcolm X because Magneto can throw an aircraft

455
00:29:22,468 --> 00:29:27,171
carrier a thousand miles across the world and blow up an atomic bomb and Malcolm X just

456
00:29:27,211 --> 00:29:29,353
wanted people to start treating black people right.

457
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:35,564
That was his endgame. If you think that this is equal to this, then you should stop writing.

458
00:29:36,827 --> 00:29:43,211
Zootopia was a bad movie. It used animals to separate people but we're all the same animal.

459
00:29:43,612 --> 00:29:49,356
If this conversation would be between two foxes, not a fox and a rabbit or two rabbits, we're not

460
00:29:49,536 --> 00:29:54,120
separate. Black people aren't carnivores and white people aren't vegetarians. That's not the

461
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:59,164
way it works. And even the writer about it basically said that it was supposed to be this

462
00:29:59,204 --> 00:30:03,987
nuanced thing and it's not nuanced at all. I kind of ran out of time. So thank you.

463
00:30:09,714 --> 00:30:15,200
One last thing. All these women are black but they were all played by white people. Same

464
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:20,045
thing here. Neil Druckmann said it was totally cool. If someone at the top of a studio is

465
00:30:20,085 --> 00:30:24,069
telling you it's totally cool to put people in digital blackface you need to take a stand

466
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:26,232
about it. You might have to quit. You might have to ‑‑

467
00:30:26,892 --> 00:30:32,597
have to do something, you might have to put this person in their office on a different world.

468
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:37,740
They protested just because he was censored on radio. If you can do that, if they're college

469
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,343
students, you can protest somebody who's running your studio who just decides to dress someone

470
00:30:41,383 --> 00:30:42,844
up in digital blackface. Thank you.
