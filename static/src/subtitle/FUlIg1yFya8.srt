1
00:00:04,577 --> 00:00:04,938
All right.

2
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:07,440
Thanks, everyone, for coming.

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,762
Let's get started.

4
00:00:10,362 --> 00:00:11,103
My name's Mike Booth.

5
00:00:11,263 --> 00:00:13,665
I'm a product manager on the Facebook Spaces team.

6
00:00:13,705 --> 00:00:16,188
I lead the development of Facebook Spaces.

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,143
So back in April, we launched Facebook Spaces.

8
00:00:24,664 --> 00:00:29,387
This is our MVP Facebook social VR experiment, basically.

9
00:00:30,468 --> 00:00:34,071
We included in that MVP sort of the bare bones of what we felt

10
00:00:34,091 --> 00:00:37,253
like we needed to get something out into the world and start

11
00:00:38,174 --> 00:00:40,076
seeing what people actually do with it and learn.

12
00:00:40,096 --> 00:00:44,219
Because everyone here knows how early it is for VR.

13
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,681
We don't know much of anything and we wanted to see what we could learn from this experience.

14
00:00:49,202 --> 00:00:52,343
So this MVP included stylized avatars.

15
00:00:52,623 --> 00:00:57,306
The goal of the avatars is that they're friendly and inviting and charming, but they're automatically

16
00:00:57,386 --> 00:00:59,927
generated through machine learning to look like you.

17
00:00:59,947 --> 00:01:03,169
We tried to remove the friction of getting into VR that way.

18
00:01:03,849 --> 00:01:09,052
You can experience your Facebook content, 2D photos and videos, 360 photos and videos.

19
00:01:10,453 --> 00:01:14,879
You can take selfies from inside of VR and post them out to VR.

20
00:01:14,919 --> 00:01:18,543
We're trying to cross the boundary between VR and 2D Facebook as well.

21
00:01:19,164 --> 00:01:27,215
We included a marker that lets you draw objects in space to give an open-ended bit of creativity to see what people would do with that.

22
00:01:28,236 --> 00:01:32,839
And our reach goal was messenger video calling, which we'll talk about in a little bit as well.

23
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:37,502
Where you could actually make a messenger video call from inside of Facebook spaces out to the real world.

24
00:01:37,542 --> 00:01:42,666
And people would answer their phone and see a cartoon version of you talking to them from inside of VR.

25
00:01:43,827 --> 00:01:43,947
So...

26
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:48,462
Our philosophy of why we built Facebook Spaces

27
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:50,823
really comes down to three things.

28
00:01:50,863 --> 00:01:54,184
The first thing is being in person with your friends,

29
00:01:54,705 --> 00:01:55,865
regardless of where you are.

30
00:01:55,905 --> 00:01:57,246
And I'll talk a little bit more about this,

31
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:01,627
but the feeling of being present with someone else

32
00:02:01,868 --> 00:02:03,948
in VR is amazing.

33
00:02:04,629 --> 00:02:06,450
I think that's the core piece of magic

34
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,610
that we're sort of hanging all of this on.

35
00:02:09,051 --> 00:02:11,112
That when you're in VR with another friend who's in VR,

36
00:02:11,132 --> 00:02:12,432
they feel like they are right there,

37
00:02:12,512 --> 00:02:13,373
so what better way

38
00:02:14,154 --> 00:02:17,050
to connect you with people that you care about than in social VR.

39
00:02:19,035 --> 00:02:20,976
The second pillar is personally meaningful content.

40
00:02:21,356 --> 00:02:23,938
So once you're together in VR,

41
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:26,079
the obvious question is what do you do?

42
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,022
And as Facebook, we have access to all of this content

43
00:02:30,102 --> 00:02:32,123
that we know is interesting to you and your friends

44
00:02:32,183 --> 00:02:34,765
because either you posted it or your friends have posted it

45
00:02:35,185 --> 00:02:37,407
or you've reacted to it and shown interest in some way.

46
00:02:37,567 --> 00:02:41,109
So we need to expose that sort of content to you in VR

47
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:43,611
so you can consume it specifically with 360 content

48
00:02:43,671 --> 00:02:45,292
in a really powerfully immersive way.

49
00:02:46,388 --> 00:02:50,851
And thirdly, you want to spend quality time with your friends doing things that you enjoy.

50
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:56,093
And this is sort of really what we're pushing on now, is now we have this sort of bare bones

51
00:02:56,573 --> 00:03:01,856
system where you can get together in VR with your friends, but we need to flesh out that

52
00:03:01,896 --> 00:03:06,618
sort of ecosystem of things to do in VR and spend quality time together.

53
00:03:08,002 --> 00:03:12,447
So I want to talk, for the rest of this talk, I want to go through what we've learned so

54
00:03:12,507 --> 00:03:16,591
far in building Facebook Spaces and seeing what people are actually doing with it.

55
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,191
So first is representing you.

56
00:03:19,851 --> 00:03:22,572
Now, I know a lot of us in the audience are game developers.

57
00:03:23,672 --> 00:03:25,493
So there's the notion of an avatar.

58
00:03:26,153 --> 00:03:28,694
This has been in video games, 2D and 3D for a long time.

59
00:03:29,214 --> 00:03:30,955
In VR, things are a bit different.

60
00:03:31,415 --> 00:03:33,636
Where it is an avatar, but this is literally you.

61
00:03:33,696 --> 00:03:34,516
This is your skin.

62
00:03:34,596 --> 00:03:36,577
When your friends are looking at you in VR,

63
00:03:36,617 --> 00:03:38,798
they're actually looking at your avatar.

64
00:03:39,238 --> 00:03:41,819
So it's really important that we get this right.

65
00:03:43,612 --> 00:03:47,094
So this goes, for me, all the way back to Oculus Connect 2015

66
00:03:47,434 --> 00:03:51,496
when I, no it was E3 I think,

67
00:03:52,317 --> 00:03:54,298
where I did the Oculus Toy Box demo for the first time.

68
00:03:54,838 --> 00:03:57,199
Now, as cool as it was to play ping pong

69
00:03:57,339 --> 00:03:59,060
and reach out and pick up objects in VR

70
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,222
and stack things and all of the fun physics things,

71
00:04:01,722 --> 00:04:04,003
the thing that really blew me away was,

72
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:06,605
my friend Jason Holtman was the one giving me the demo,

73
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:09,627
he works at Oculus, that floating blue head

74
00:04:09,807 --> 00:04:11,307
and those disembodied blue hands,

75
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,361
was Jason. Like it literally felt like Jason was right there. His voice was coming out.

76
00:04:16,821 --> 00:04:21,162
And it really comes down to, you know, the sixth degree of freedom tracking of your head

77
00:04:21,202 --> 00:04:24,763
and hands. All that subtle body language, the way he holds himself, how he uses his

78
00:04:24,783 --> 00:04:28,864
hands when he talks, it all came through. And I've been in the game industry for a long

79
00:04:28,904 --> 00:04:32,565
time. I've seen all the AAA stuff, which is all amazing. I was up way too late last night

80
00:04:32,585 --> 00:04:33,005
playing PUBG.

81
00:04:35,529 --> 00:04:37,950
was the most impressive thing I had seen to date.

82
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:42,393
So how can we take this and add to it,

83
00:04:42,553 --> 00:04:44,414
expand on it, make it even more intense?

84
00:04:45,955 --> 00:04:47,356
So when I started with Facebook,

85
00:04:47,816 --> 00:04:49,097
it was just me, I didn't have any artists,

86
00:04:49,257 --> 00:04:51,438
so I hacked this up, trying to experiment,

87
00:04:51,478 --> 00:04:53,299
like could we do eyes, could we do emotions,

88
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,541
and ended up with this really creepy cross

89
00:04:55,601 --> 00:04:57,121
between Max Headroom and Charlie Sheen.

90
00:04:58,727 --> 00:05:03,890
What was really apparent from this is when you're in VR with this guy, he is really creepy and this is not what we want to do.

91
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:09,234
But, I can make eye contact with it and I could use a, like a thumb stick on a controller and sort of

92
00:05:09,774 --> 00:05:13,216
lurk between emotional states and I could see the emotions on their face.

93
00:05:13,276 --> 00:05:18,939
So, it was, it was interesting and how could we actually make that something that was not awful.

94
00:05:19,741 --> 00:05:21,702
So we actually got some real artists involved,

95
00:05:22,162 --> 00:05:24,083
and we built these early stylized humans.

96
00:05:24,504 --> 00:05:25,284
And they're really charming.

97
00:05:25,344 --> 00:05:26,745
They look great in 2D.

98
00:05:27,225 --> 00:05:29,126
And this is where we discovered that there's a big difference,

99
00:05:29,286 --> 00:05:31,407
obviously, between 2D and being in person

100
00:05:31,427 --> 00:05:32,288
with something in VR.

101
00:05:32,808 --> 00:05:34,749
When you're in VR with these avatars,

102
00:05:34,789 --> 00:05:36,770
there was something just a little off-putting

103
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:37,771
and unsettling about them.

104
00:05:38,611 --> 00:05:40,373
Part of that was the eyes.

105
00:05:40,393 --> 00:05:42,395
Their eyes are kind of big and spherical and bulbous.

106
00:05:42,956 --> 00:05:44,217
But what it really was is the mouth.

107
00:05:45,098 --> 00:05:47,280
And specifically, which I'm not showing here,

108
00:05:47,301 --> 00:05:48,262
but the mouth motion.

109
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:50,063
The fact that you had this smooth mouth

110
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:52,126
and it was smoothly lerping between shapes,

111
00:05:52,626 --> 00:05:53,727
but it wasn't quite right,

112
00:05:54,568 --> 00:05:56,330
made you just not want to be in the same room

113
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:57,011
with that thing.

114
00:06:01,422 --> 00:06:02,863
So, that's a little bit hard to see,

115
00:06:02,883 --> 00:06:04,323
he's a red rabbit on a black background.

116
00:06:05,203 --> 00:06:06,743
Where this took us though,

117
00:06:06,963 --> 00:06:08,884
was what we ended up calling the Rabitar.

118
00:06:09,624 --> 00:06:12,325
And this guy, there's a whole host of things

119
00:06:12,345 --> 00:06:13,345
that we learned based on this.

120
00:06:13,745 --> 00:06:15,905
First of all, there's a torso and there are arms.

121
00:06:15,985 --> 00:06:18,946
We're inferring that based on where your hands and head are.

122
00:06:19,326 --> 00:06:20,306
The fact that we can do that

123
00:06:20,386 --> 00:06:22,927
and it's reasonably believable was great.

124
00:06:23,067 --> 00:06:24,607
Now we don't actually show that for you

125
00:06:24,707 --> 00:06:27,008
because if you look down, your actual arms won't line up.

126
00:06:27,508 --> 00:06:30,931
and that didn't work, but it works great

127
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:32,252
for everyone else in the space.

128
00:06:32,853 --> 00:06:34,034
Another thing that wasn't obvious

129
00:06:34,154 --> 00:06:37,157
is that the Rabbitard's eyes are 2D.

130
00:06:37,617 --> 00:06:40,780
They're just 2D sort of tune eyes pasted on their head,

131
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:42,522
but you could still make eye contact

132
00:06:42,562 --> 00:06:44,544
and really feel like you're making eye contact

133
00:06:44,644 --> 00:06:46,646
with another person in VR with 2D eyes,

134
00:06:47,126 --> 00:06:49,028
which is great because asset-wise,

135
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:50,850
they're really quick to iterate on

136
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,051
and very cheap assets to make.

137
00:06:52,692 --> 00:06:56,315
Also, the emoting, the ability to make expressions

138
00:06:56,335 --> 00:06:58,797
and have those expressions read worked really well.

139
00:06:59,337 --> 00:07:01,259
And the secondary motion, the giant rabbit ears

140
00:07:01,299 --> 00:07:03,500
that are flopping around, the hair, the whiskers, et cetera.

141
00:07:04,001 --> 00:07:06,983
The amount of expressivity that the secondary motion brings

142
00:07:08,604 --> 00:07:11,107
to the table is really useful,

143
00:07:11,147 --> 00:07:13,408
especially when you have these limited channels

144
00:07:13,428 --> 00:07:14,269
that you're talking through.

145
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:15,550
Adding everything we can add to that

146
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:17,271
to bring more personality is great.

147
00:07:19,462 --> 00:07:21,365
The last thing you'll see here is the gestural emotes.

148
00:07:21,385 --> 00:07:22,528
We'll talk a bit more about these,

149
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,652
but the ability to put your hands on your cheeks

150
00:07:24,832 --> 00:07:27,276
and make an emotion happen was something

151
00:07:27,316 --> 00:07:29,460
that people found really fun.

152
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,342
We'll talk about that in a little bit.

153
00:07:32,122 --> 00:07:35,625
Okay, so as charming and fun as that was

154
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,406
and the number of things that we learned from it,

155
00:07:37,886 --> 00:07:40,588
Facebook is really about connecting you with your friends

156
00:07:40,628 --> 00:07:42,449
and presenting your authentic self.

157
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:45,532
And as I am not a giant orange rabbit,

158
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:46,833
this wasn't going to work.

159
00:07:47,393 --> 00:07:49,494
So for F8, we took a step back

160
00:07:49,554 --> 00:07:51,095
and we revisited the toy box

161
00:07:51,115 --> 00:07:54,118
and we had an artist use our VR markers

162
00:07:54,598 --> 00:07:57,420
to basically do a caricature drawing on these VR,

163
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,601
these toy box heads.

164
00:07:59,201 --> 00:08:03,325
And this is myself on the left and Mike Schrepp for the CTO on the right.

165
00:08:04,246 --> 00:08:08,710
And we use this for a live keynote demo at FA 2016.

166
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,772
And that seemed to work really well.

167
00:08:10,792 --> 00:08:14,155
I mean, these are very simple, but it was very clear who Schrepp was and

168
00:08:14,195 --> 00:08:15,896
who I was.

169
00:08:18,407 --> 00:08:21,929
So moving on from that, for OC3 last year,

170
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:26,492
we did another live demo, and we at that point

171
00:08:26,532 --> 00:08:29,914
had settled on these sort of stylized cartoon avatars

172
00:08:30,414 --> 00:08:31,355
where again, like this.

173
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:33,716
is more or less me.

174
00:08:34,536 --> 00:08:36,336
It's not exactly, but it's friendly

175
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,737
and charming and stylized,

176
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:40,137
but it has all of the things we learned from the rabbitar.

177
00:08:40,157 --> 00:08:41,378
There's a torso, there are arms,

178
00:08:41,778 --> 00:08:43,458
I can emote, I can make eye contact,

179
00:08:43,938 --> 00:08:46,439
and this worked well for our demo.

180
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:48,279
We continue to iterate on this,

181
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,920
and by the time we shipped our MVP in April,

182
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,842
of this year, this is where we landed.

183
00:08:54,022 --> 00:08:55,463
And again, we're taking more of the learnings

184
00:08:55,963 --> 00:08:57,924
from our previous experiments, and you can see here,

185
00:08:57,944 --> 00:09:00,045
like the eyes have gone back to 2D eyes,

186
00:09:00,686 --> 00:09:02,907
and just general refinements to shaders

187
00:09:02,947 --> 00:09:04,148
and forms and whatnot.

188
00:09:04,748 --> 00:09:06,229
And we've continued to iterate on this

189
00:09:06,309 --> 00:09:08,831
to our current avatars right now,

190
00:09:09,191 --> 00:09:11,332
with just subtle details, like now we have more controls

191
00:09:11,372 --> 00:09:13,193
for the user to go in, and like in this case,

192
00:09:13,674 --> 00:09:15,915
I was able to have a different color

193
00:09:16,395 --> 00:09:17,996
to show that my goatee is gray

194
00:09:18,036 --> 00:09:19,457
and my receding hairline is brown.

195
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,218
So this leads us to sort of our golden rule

196
00:09:25,579 --> 00:09:27,139
of avatars for VR.

197
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:30,221
First one is, you should be happy with how you look.

198
00:09:30,301 --> 00:09:32,662
And I'm reasonably happy with that guy.

199
00:09:34,563 --> 00:09:35,984
And the second one is your close friends

200
00:09:36,004 --> 00:09:36,724
should recognize you.

201
00:09:37,085 --> 00:09:38,045
So this is, in other words,

202
00:09:38,165 --> 00:09:39,946
like this does not have to be a perfect representation.

203
00:09:40,426 --> 00:09:42,587
Not everyone in the world needs to be able to look at

204
00:09:43,048 --> 00:09:43,788
you know, an avatar and go,

205
00:09:43,808 --> 00:09:44,929
oh that is exactly that person.

206
00:09:45,369 --> 00:09:46,610
But if you're in context,

207
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:48,631
in a social environment with friends,

208
00:09:49,011 --> 00:09:49,911
it should be very clear, you know,

209
00:09:49,931 --> 00:09:51,512
oh that's Mike, that's so and so, that's so and so.

210
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,701
So how do we create these avatars?

211
00:09:57,121 --> 00:09:59,802
So here you see our current interface in Facebook Spaces,

212
00:10:00,342 --> 00:10:01,902
where again, we're using machine learning.

213
00:10:02,943 --> 00:10:06,744
So you log into Facebook and we can bring up photos of you,

214
00:10:07,244 --> 00:10:09,024
and you basically can pick one of those photos,

215
00:10:09,605 --> 00:10:11,805
and it presents you with several guesses.

216
00:10:12,726 --> 00:10:18,871
of what your avatar might look like. This was important because initially we really wanted to

217
00:10:18,891 --> 00:10:24,396
remove the friction so we just would, as soon as you grabbed a photo, just put a guess of what you

218
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:28,460
look like in the mirror. And as good as the machine learning algorithms are, they're not always

219
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,484
perfect. So sometimes this was jarring because it felt like Facebook was making a very clear

220
00:10:33,604 --> 00:10:33,945
judgment.

221
00:10:35,826 --> 00:10:36,807
which is not our goal.

222
00:10:37,747 --> 00:10:39,588
So by presenting you with five choices,

223
00:10:39,608 --> 00:10:43,290
it's clear to the user that these are guesses,

224
00:10:43,651 --> 00:10:44,391
pick the one you like.

225
00:10:44,431 --> 00:10:45,932
And if you don't like that one, grab another photo

226
00:10:45,952 --> 00:10:48,333
and kind of keep going till you find one that you do like.

227
00:10:49,174 --> 00:10:52,436
Even once you have selected the one that you like best,

228
00:10:53,056 --> 00:10:55,798
You then are free to modify any part of it.

229
00:10:55,898 --> 00:10:58,960
So you can change colors, change eyes, change shapes,

230
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,360
change nose shapes, et cetera.

231
00:11:01,121 --> 00:11:03,102
And as you can see with this example,

232
00:11:03,182 --> 00:11:05,223
like, oh, that particular one didn't have glasses,

233
00:11:05,243 --> 00:11:06,864
so I'll put glasses on and I'll set them to blue.

234
00:11:08,365 --> 00:11:10,967
On the left there, you can see we have a couple of images

235
00:11:11,027 --> 00:11:12,288
of pre-saved avatars.

236
00:11:12,808 --> 00:11:15,129
So if you've made, you might wanna have an avatar

237
00:11:15,229 --> 00:11:17,991
for different occasions, so you can preset some avatars,

238
00:11:18,071 --> 00:11:19,732
bring this up and quickly switch back

239
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:21,653
to an earlier creation you've made.

240
00:11:23,189 --> 00:11:26,972
But the key point here is that you have the final say on how you look.

241
00:11:30,195 --> 00:11:36,400
Okay. So now we have these avatars. We automatically generate them for you, give you the tools

242
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,484
to tweak them just how you like. How do we actually bring them to life so it's actually

243
00:11:40,604 --> 00:11:41,605
you coming through?

244
00:11:45,396 --> 00:11:46,717
This is a really interesting example.

245
00:11:46,777 --> 00:11:49,239
These are white dots moving on a black background,

246
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:50,240
but when we look at this,

247
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,622
we can't help but see a person walking

248
00:11:53,102 --> 00:11:54,563
because these dots were motion captured

249
00:11:55,124 --> 00:11:56,585
and our brains are wired to see

250
00:11:56,605 --> 00:11:57,986
that sort of biological motion.

251
00:11:58,967 --> 00:12:00,588
The good thing about this is anything

252
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:03,050
that is captured in this way will seem alive

253
00:12:03,771 --> 00:12:05,312
and the current state of VR,

254
00:12:05,432 --> 00:12:07,174
at least with six degree of freedom tracking,

255
00:12:07,854 --> 00:12:09,515
is basically a built-in motion capture studio.

256
00:12:10,256 --> 00:12:12,537
If you're wearing a six degree of freedom headset

257
00:12:12,677 --> 00:12:14,278
on your head and you're holding six degree

258
00:12:14,298 --> 00:12:15,619
of freedom trackers in your hands,

259
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,961
then we get this biological motion

260
00:12:18,521 --> 00:12:19,381
and it comes through.

261
00:12:19,462 --> 00:12:21,583
As long as we don't, like we did do some experiments

262
00:12:21,603 --> 00:12:23,204
where we tried to do some intermediate animations

263
00:12:23,244 --> 00:12:25,065
and whatnot and that washed out that signal.

264
00:12:25,685 --> 00:12:26,346
We don't wanna do that.

265
00:12:26,406 --> 00:12:28,587
Basically, that signal we wanna leave alone

266
00:12:28,627 --> 00:12:30,568
and let it just come through in your avatar

267
00:12:30,608 --> 00:12:33,270
because that's carrying all of your body language

268
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:34,911
and mannerisms and it's really powerful.

269
00:12:38,218 --> 00:12:40,739
So obviously we can't see where your eyes are looking

270
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:43,500
in this headset, but we can infer based on

271
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,821
where your headset is looking and what objects

272
00:12:45,841 --> 00:12:48,021
are in the scene, what you're probably looking at.

273
00:12:48,061 --> 00:12:49,282
And we make an educated guess,

274
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:51,543
and it actually works quite well.

275
00:12:52,803 --> 00:12:55,604
Again, we've chosen the environment carefully,

276
00:12:55,724 --> 00:12:58,265
and people are the most interesting thing generally anyway,

277
00:12:58,825 --> 00:13:00,466
but this really helped.

278
00:13:00,966 --> 00:13:03,567
to have eye contact, and you get quickly to a place

279
00:13:03,967 --> 00:13:05,267
where arguably this is more interesting

280
00:13:05,307 --> 00:13:06,088
than a video conference,

281
00:13:06,528 --> 00:13:08,248
because you can tell where people are looking,

282
00:13:08,268 --> 00:13:09,649
what they're paying, oops, sorry,

283
00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:12,070
where they're looking, what they're paying attention to,

284
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:13,630
whether they're engaged or not,

285
00:13:14,451 --> 00:13:15,891
and you can get gaze following as well,

286
00:13:15,911 --> 00:13:16,891
where someone would look at something

287
00:13:16,911 --> 00:13:17,992
and you see them looking at that,

288
00:13:18,012 --> 00:13:19,352
and then you look over to see what they're looking at.

289
00:13:22,798 --> 00:13:26,040
In addition, lip sync is really interesting and important,

290
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,381
but in a particular way.

291
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:29,642
So with this lip sync, you can see it's very simple

292
00:13:29,682 --> 00:13:30,463
and very stylized.

293
00:13:30,503 --> 00:13:32,224
We're using replacement animation,

294
00:13:32,264 --> 00:13:33,865
like an Aardman or a Leica sort of thing.

295
00:13:34,785 --> 00:13:36,846
In our earlier experiments, we did try,

296
00:13:37,146 --> 00:13:39,448
as we mentioned earlier, like having more realistic lips

297
00:13:39,948 --> 00:13:41,769
and doing all the proper things with blend shapes

298
00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:43,450
and lerping between all the visemes,

299
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:45,231
and it was never quite right,

300
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,432
because we're just inferring based off of the audio,

301
00:13:47,832 --> 00:13:48,973
and that just seemed creepy.

302
00:13:49,233 --> 00:13:50,614
It was close, but not exact,

303
00:13:50,674 --> 00:13:51,774
so we're in the uncanny valley.

304
00:13:52,235 --> 00:13:55,456
So we backed off and we intentionally went very stylized

305
00:13:55,536 --> 00:13:58,278
with visemes that just snap to different shapes.

306
00:13:58,978 --> 00:13:59,918
But this works really well,

307
00:14:00,218 --> 00:14:01,539
because your brain looks at this and says,

308
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:02,740
oh, that person is talking,

309
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,801
and it looks like they're saying what they're saying,

310
00:14:04,841 --> 00:14:06,321
because most of the visemes match up,

311
00:14:06,621 --> 00:14:07,722
but you do not believe it's real,

312
00:14:07,742 --> 00:14:08,962
so you're not trying to believe

313
00:14:09,002 --> 00:14:10,983
that this is a real thing in front of you.

314
00:14:13,768 --> 00:14:15,169
Then we talked about this with the emoting.

315
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:19,152
This is really important and something that we're pushing on

316
00:14:19,612 --> 00:14:20,893
is that it's not enough to be there

317
00:14:20,913 --> 00:14:22,774
and to look like yourself, be able to make eye contact,

318
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,235
you want to express yourself.

319
00:14:24,536 --> 00:14:26,057
And these are your friends who are gonna do things

320
00:14:26,077 --> 00:14:29,199
that will make you angry or laugh or smile

321
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,359
or be surprised or whatnot.

322
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,561
So we need some way to at least start to be able to do this.

323
00:14:33,121 --> 00:14:35,423
So this is another example of the gestural emote.

324
00:14:35,463 --> 00:14:37,644
So if you take your hands and put them on your cheeks.

325
00:14:38,425 --> 00:14:41,007
It will automatically express this oh my gosh expression.

326
00:14:41,587 --> 00:14:42,868
We have a whole set of these we're working on

327
00:14:42,909 --> 00:14:44,310
where you put your hands on top of your head

328
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:45,130
and then you're scared.

329
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,533
You bring your hands up over your head and it's hooray

330
00:14:48,553 --> 00:14:49,734
like you saw with the rabbitar.

331
00:14:50,355 --> 00:14:51,836
You do like this and you're confused.

332
00:14:52,937 --> 00:14:55,019
And what's fun about these is they're inherently social.

333
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:57,060
So you'll see someone do this like oh, how did you do that?

334
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,242
And you just, well, you just put your hands on your cheeks

335
00:14:59,262 --> 00:15:00,944
and then they try it in a mirror and like oh, that's great.

336
00:15:01,064 --> 00:15:02,665
And you can propagate that on that way.

337
00:15:03,866 --> 00:15:04,346
With that said,

338
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:08,233
If you are, say, putting on a show,

339
00:15:08,313 --> 00:15:09,214
maybe you're live streaming,

340
00:15:09,254 --> 00:15:11,476
as we added the ability to live stream

341
00:15:11,516 --> 00:15:14,299
from VR out to Facebook a few months ago,

342
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,521
you wanna have direct control.

343
00:15:16,781 --> 00:15:18,823
So we also allow you to use the thumb sticks

344
00:15:18,863 --> 00:15:20,165
to basically puppeteer your face.

345
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:23,288
So in this case, if you push both thumbsticks together,

346
00:15:23,728 --> 00:15:26,331
then your avatar will make that same oh my gosh face,

347
00:15:26,391 --> 00:15:28,033
but it will stay there as long as you hold it.

348
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:30,576
And you can quickly switch between emotions this way.

349
00:15:31,136 --> 00:15:32,678
So you can build up muscle memory

350
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:33,579
and get pretty quick at this,

351
00:15:33,659 --> 00:15:35,401
but clearly, these are early days,

352
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:37,903
and this is very much like VR emoji,

353
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,685
as in a text message you would add emoji.

354
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,767
But the fact you can do it at all,

355
00:15:41,847 --> 00:15:42,748
I think is really important.

356
00:15:44,182 --> 00:15:46,704
Because at the end of the day, what we want to have,

357
00:15:47,204 --> 00:15:48,965
particularly for Facebook social VR,

358
00:15:49,386 --> 00:15:52,328
is we want to have avatars that are recognizable

359
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,910
by your friends and are interesting and expressive enough

360
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,771
that you actually want to take selfies of

361
00:15:57,192 --> 00:15:58,473
and post to Facebook, for example.

362
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:04,116
Physical contact, so physical contact I'm using,

363
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:06,218
I mean, you're in VR, it's not physical,

364
00:16:06,258 --> 00:16:08,079
but if I reach out and actually make contact

365
00:16:08,099 --> 00:16:10,061
with your avatar, we should recognize that

366
00:16:10,121 --> 00:16:11,502
and something good should happen.

367
00:16:12,123 --> 00:16:14,645
This is, I think, a really interesting example.

368
00:16:15,045 --> 00:16:18,288
So we were at a previous trade show last year.

369
00:16:18,308 --> 00:16:19,469
We were demonstrating this,

370
00:16:19,749 --> 00:16:21,571
but spaces at the time had a bug.

371
00:16:22,031 --> 00:16:24,634
where you can reach out and shake hands with someone,

372
00:16:24,835 --> 00:16:25,916
which is actually really cool

373
00:16:25,956 --> 00:16:27,278
because you're holding a touch controller.

374
00:16:27,318 --> 00:16:30,042
So when you actually grab the other person's virtual hand,

375
00:16:30,062 --> 00:16:31,263
you're squeezing the touch controller

376
00:16:31,283 --> 00:16:32,985
and it really feels like you're holding their hand.

377
00:16:33,992 --> 00:16:34,673
But there was a bug.

378
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:36,854
So when you would log in initially,

379
00:16:36,974 --> 00:16:38,114
you'd be holding hands.

380
00:16:38,454 --> 00:16:39,695
Your arms were stuck together.

381
00:16:40,295 --> 00:16:42,336
So we had a person come in,

382
00:16:42,436 --> 00:16:43,457
and we're gonna show them spaces.

383
00:16:44,077 --> 00:16:47,279
And we had Alicia, our producer,

384
00:16:47,379 --> 00:16:50,020
back in Menlo Park ready to meet them.

385
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,881
So he puts the headset on,

386
00:16:51,921 --> 00:16:54,002
and he finds himself standing about this far away

387
00:16:54,262 --> 00:16:55,342
from a woman he doesn't know,

388
00:16:55,643 --> 00:16:57,303
staring into her eyes and holding her hands.

389
00:16:58,899 --> 00:17:00,180
And he blushed.

390
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,021
He blushed, this was awesome.

391
00:17:02,081 --> 00:17:03,082
He physically blushed.

392
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:04,443
His lizard brain believed it enough

393
00:17:04,463 --> 00:17:05,765
that he turned red and blushed.

394
00:17:06,065 --> 00:17:07,166
And he took off his headset and he said,

395
00:17:07,186 --> 00:17:07,907
I need to tell my wife.

396
00:17:10,689 --> 00:17:12,671
The fact that we can, you can't fake that, right?

397
00:17:12,711 --> 00:17:15,793
The fact that we can induce that sort of level of reaction

398
00:17:16,214 --> 00:17:17,935
is super powerful and gets me very excited

399
00:17:17,975 --> 00:17:19,216
about what we can do in social VR.

400
00:17:20,885 --> 00:17:24,028
So here's another example, high-fiving a friend.

401
00:17:24,368 --> 00:17:26,430
Like, there's a sound effect,

402
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:27,591
there should be a particle effect.

403
00:17:27,892 --> 00:17:29,773
Whenever someone actually makes the effort to do this,

404
00:17:30,134 --> 00:17:31,555
we should recognize it and celebrate it.

405
00:17:33,848 --> 00:17:41,013
Now, as powerful as VR is, you really do feel present with these folks, right?

406
00:17:41,033 --> 00:17:46,598
Now, Facebook Spaces is all about connecting you to friends using the friend graph in Facebook.

407
00:17:47,939 --> 00:17:52,082
But some people have lots of friends, and some people have, you know, that guy.

408
00:17:52,763 --> 00:17:55,585
So you want to make sure that you feel safe and comfortable.

409
00:17:56,486 --> 00:18:02,191
in VR. So when we launched, we have these safety features. For example, on the left is the safety bubble.

410
00:18:02,651 --> 00:18:06,915
So by default, nothing can get within about arm's reach of you unless you allow it.

411
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:11,880
If someone tries to reach into your space or put their face in your face, they just vanish.

412
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,043
You have to let them do that for that to happen.

413
00:18:15,544 --> 00:18:18,967
On the right, you have a wrist menu, so you have a watch basically.

414
00:18:19,167 --> 00:18:21,029
And on the inside of that watch is a big pause button.

415
00:18:21,569 --> 00:18:30,572
So if someone is being obnoxious doing something you don't like, or someone puts up a really high resolution 360 video of a super violent roller coaster that does not make you happy,

416
00:18:31,192 --> 00:18:36,814
you can just hit the pause button and stop the world. Everyone disappears, all the content shuts off, you can gather yourself and decide what to do.

417
00:18:37,194 --> 00:18:41,156
You also have the ability to mute and block and kick people that are in your space as well.

418
00:18:41,276 --> 00:18:45,317
So we really take seriously trying to keep things friendly and safe.

419
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:50,129
Okay, so that was you and how you are in VR.

420
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:51,910
Let's talk about your space.

421
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,611
So when we started this project,

422
00:18:55,111 --> 00:18:57,552
like my assumption was that we would be hiring

423
00:18:57,592 --> 00:18:58,792
a giant team of 3D artists.

424
00:18:58,812 --> 00:19:00,433
We'd be building this immense 3D space

425
00:19:00,853 --> 00:19:02,513
that we'd all be exploring and whatnot.

426
00:19:03,094 --> 00:19:04,734
And this was one of our early experiments

427
00:19:05,034 --> 00:19:06,195
where this is like a clubhouse

428
00:19:06,275 --> 00:19:07,255
with all sorts of things to do.

429
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,781
For what we're really trying to do,

430
00:19:10,801 --> 00:19:13,644
of frictionlessly bring people into VR,

431
00:19:13,704 --> 00:19:14,985
connect them with people they care about

432
00:19:15,025 --> 00:19:16,387
and share personally meaningful content,

433
00:19:16,887 --> 00:19:17,908
this was a distraction.

434
00:19:18,429 --> 00:19:19,950
Because locomotion is challenging,

435
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,412
we immediately found that like,

436
00:19:21,552 --> 00:19:23,914
okay, well, there's the problem of what do we decide to do?

437
00:19:23,974 --> 00:19:25,836
How do we get everyone to do this thing and not that thing?

438
00:19:26,377 --> 00:19:28,098
It wasn't focused on the same things

439
00:19:28,118 --> 00:19:29,139
we were trying to accomplish.

440
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:32,190
Another experiment is fishing.

441
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:36,751
Fishing as an activity is ideally suited to socializing.

442
00:19:37,171 --> 00:19:39,091
Right, it's not so intense that it's drawing

443
00:19:39,131 --> 00:19:40,952
all of your attention and you can hang out and talk

444
00:19:41,052 --> 00:19:43,152
while you're fishing and occasionally exciting things happen.

445
00:19:43,692 --> 00:19:45,773
The problem here is that we literally got lost in the woods.

446
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:48,374
It's hard to see, but on the other side of the lake there

447
00:19:48,394 --> 00:19:50,274
is the other avatar, and they're way far away

448
00:19:50,394 --> 00:19:52,255
and the audio falls off and like,

449
00:19:52,555 --> 00:19:54,635
people would literally be like, hey, where'd you go?

450
00:19:54,655 --> 00:19:55,675
And they'd be trying to find each other.

451
00:19:55,715 --> 00:19:56,716
That was not, that didn't fit

452
00:19:56,736 --> 00:19:57,516
with what we were trying to do.

453
00:19:59,229 --> 00:20:01,952
Another thing that everyone wants to do,

454
00:20:02,312 --> 00:20:05,555
thinks they want to do, is I wanna have a space,

455
00:20:05,675 --> 00:20:07,136
I wanna decorate it just the way I want,

456
00:20:07,216 --> 00:20:08,617
I wanna paint all the walls just so,

457
00:20:08,657 --> 00:20:09,958
and put all these furniture here and whatnot.

458
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:14,683
And this is true, and it definitely has a place,

459
00:20:14,783 --> 00:20:17,045
and I'm sure that we will come back to this.

460
00:20:18,743 --> 00:20:20,784
And obviously we invested pretty heavily exploring this.

461
00:20:21,425 --> 00:20:25,608
But ultimately, if I want to meet a friend and catch up with them, and

462
00:20:26,189 --> 00:20:29,691
see some latest videos with them, or share some personally meaningful content with them.

463
00:20:30,872 --> 00:20:35,255
If I have to start VR and go in and select all my furniture choices and

464
00:20:35,295 --> 00:20:38,057
material choices and decorate my space and light everything and

465
00:20:38,077 --> 00:20:41,640
have my friends come over and evaluate how they think I am as an interior designer.

466
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,602
Like, that's a lot of, that's friction.

467
00:20:44,923 --> 00:20:46,404
So we went in a different direction.

468
00:20:46,544 --> 00:20:47,224
Where we ended up.

469
00:20:48,321 --> 00:20:51,523
is this blue table at the bottom there.

470
00:20:51,563 --> 00:20:53,265
Basically the idea was a dinner party

471
00:20:53,305 --> 00:20:54,006
for you and your friends.

472
00:20:54,426 --> 00:20:56,068
So it's you and three of your friends in a space.

473
00:20:56,608 --> 00:20:58,650
There is a table that you're all focused around

474
00:20:59,651 --> 00:21:01,032
and you always know where your friends are.

475
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:07,146
Okay, so the table itself.

476
00:21:07,406 --> 00:21:08,407
It was not clear at the beginning

477
00:21:08,427 --> 00:21:09,469
that there should be a table at all.

478
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:13,012
And we sort of evolved our way there over time.

479
00:21:13,553 --> 00:21:16,516
And this was our first demo with,

480
00:21:16,576 --> 00:21:19,399
the live demo with Shrepp at F8.

481
00:21:20,501 --> 00:21:21,682
So here, very literal, right?

482
00:21:21,802 --> 00:21:23,944
Okay, we have a table and here's all the parts and pieces

483
00:21:24,045 --> 00:21:26,447
we need to put on our presentation.

484
00:21:27,509 --> 00:21:29,692
Obviously, that was not going to scale.

485
00:21:30,092 --> 00:21:35,521
We have this lovely, on the left there is our bowling ball rack with our four photo

486
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:36,783
spheres that we're going to show for the demo.

487
00:21:37,043 --> 00:21:39,266
That's not going to scale to the millions of photos that are on Facebook.

488
00:21:41,077 --> 00:21:43,920
Where we've ended up is this sort of arrangement

489
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,161
where you have a table,

490
00:21:45,421 --> 00:21:47,683
in the center of the table is a display system

491
00:21:47,703 --> 00:21:49,044
so you can take content, put it there,

492
00:21:49,104 --> 00:21:50,005
display it to the room.

493
00:21:50,345 --> 00:21:53,247
You have a tablet with a recognizable interface

494
00:21:53,607 --> 00:21:55,769
that you can access things like a shelf full of tools

495
00:21:55,789 --> 00:21:56,490
that are all useful.

496
00:21:57,371 --> 00:21:59,212
So we've been sort of iterating our way,

497
00:21:59,552 --> 00:22:00,893
figuring out VR UI,

498
00:22:00,933 --> 00:22:04,236
which VR UI is at least as challenging as avatars

499
00:22:04,276 --> 00:22:05,477
and everything else that we've been doing.

500
00:22:05,537 --> 00:22:06,858
It's extremely hard.

501
00:22:08,795 --> 00:22:12,579
For example, here's what we started with with Photospheres.

502
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,841
This is super fun, magical, and charming, right?

503
00:22:14,861 --> 00:22:18,225
You see this like magical orb you can pick up and look at,

504
00:22:18,825 --> 00:22:20,407
and you can orient it in just the right way,

505
00:22:20,427 --> 00:22:22,309
and you put it on your face, and boom, there you are.

506
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:24,291
Not super discoverable.

507
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:27,013
People did not, they were mystified by the orb,

508
00:22:27,033 --> 00:22:28,054
it was great, but no one thought,

509
00:22:28,074 --> 00:22:29,155
hey, I will shove this on my face,

510
00:22:29,195 --> 00:22:30,176
and that's how I will display it.

511
00:22:32,161 --> 00:22:35,884
So what we did is we made this display center in the center of the table.

512
00:22:35,904 --> 00:22:40,127
And although you don't see it here, as soon as you pick up content that can be displayed,

513
00:22:40,187 --> 00:22:41,308
the center of the table will glow.

514
00:22:41,789 --> 00:22:42,849
So you're like, oh, it's glowing.

515
00:22:42,869 --> 00:22:44,991
Maybe if I put it in the center of the table, it will display.

516
00:22:45,411 --> 00:22:48,094
And that was much more discoverable.

517
00:22:48,574 --> 00:22:52,637
We lost the ability to orient the photo, though, right, where you could sort of look at it

518
00:22:52,657 --> 00:22:55,159
and say, I want the Eiffel Tower to be there, and then you put it on your face.

519
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,221
So we had to iterate our way through that.

520
00:22:57,441 --> 00:23:01,104
Plus, the center of the table is like the most valuable real estate.

521
00:23:01,935 --> 00:23:05,620
of the table. So if you actually want to do anything else, like say play a board game

522
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,344
or something, the display center made it very difficult.

523
00:23:09,377 --> 00:23:10,637
So where we've evolved now,

524
00:23:10,777 --> 00:23:12,397
and we're just releasing this soon,

525
00:23:12,597 --> 00:23:13,998
is that we've moved the display center

526
00:23:14,038 --> 00:23:15,158
to hover above the table,

527
00:23:15,558 --> 00:23:18,599
and only appear when you grab content that can be displayed.

528
00:23:19,139 --> 00:23:22,239
And as you saw there when I brought up the 360 photo,

529
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,440
you can sort of put it in the display center and turn it,

530
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,121
and orient the display,

531
00:23:27,501 --> 00:23:29,241
while keeping the portal only so big,

532
00:23:29,721 --> 00:23:31,762
because if we had the whole world swinging around you,

533
00:23:31,882 --> 00:23:34,182
that was also, could be upsetting.

534
00:23:35,105 --> 00:23:39,728
So this is a schematic of sort of where Facebook Spaces is right now for VR UI and the different

535
00:23:39,768 --> 00:23:40,308
affordances.

536
00:23:40,788 --> 00:23:42,990
We talked about the table and the display center.

537
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:47,093
Whenever you put 2D content into the display center, it goes on the big display there.

538
00:23:47,813 --> 00:23:49,374
The dock and the projected UI.

539
00:23:50,014 --> 00:23:50,715
So you have a watch.

540
00:23:51,395 --> 00:23:52,216
that is on your wrist.

541
00:23:52,876 --> 00:23:53,876
First of all, it shows the time,

542
00:23:53,896 --> 00:23:55,496
which is really freaking useful in VR

543
00:23:55,856 --> 00:23:57,017
to know what time it actually is.

544
00:23:57,457 --> 00:23:59,517
But any messages that come in will appear there

545
00:23:59,577 --> 00:24:00,578
from Messenger and whatnot.

546
00:24:00,618 --> 00:24:02,698
So it's sort of your notification center

547
00:24:02,998 --> 00:24:03,699
of what's happening.

548
00:24:04,639 --> 00:24:06,599
And then any object, we'll see this in a bit,

549
00:24:06,619 --> 00:24:08,680
any object you pick up will have a context sensitive

550
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,460
wrist menu for the object that you're holding.

551
00:24:13,974 --> 00:24:16,776
So for example, these are dice,

552
00:24:16,836 --> 00:24:18,718
which we just recently added to the spaces.

553
00:24:19,778 --> 00:24:22,300
And you can see that as we interact with the dice,

554
00:24:23,441 --> 00:24:24,502
the wrist menu updates.

555
00:24:24,582 --> 00:24:26,363
Like if I'm holding a dice in my hand,

556
00:24:26,803 --> 00:24:28,304
the wrist menu becomes, you know,

557
00:24:28,364 --> 00:24:29,485
context sensitive to that dice.

558
00:24:29,505 --> 00:24:31,126
So I can add more dice, I can gather the dice,

559
00:24:31,186 --> 00:24:32,948
I can delete the dice, et cetera.

560
00:24:33,788 --> 00:24:35,149
It's one thing that you have to learn,

561
00:24:35,169 --> 00:24:37,171
but once you've learned that, every object in the space

562
00:24:37,831 --> 00:24:40,073
has a similar menu that's appropriate to that object.

563
00:24:43,755 --> 00:24:46,817
So this is another interesting bit of VR UI.

564
00:24:46,897 --> 00:24:49,198
So this is distance grab that we're starting to play with.

565
00:24:49,518 --> 00:24:51,379
I know there's a lot of VR systems out there

566
00:24:51,399 --> 00:24:53,860
that allow you to grab things at a distance and bring it in.

567
00:24:54,441 --> 00:24:55,661
In the case of social VR,

568
00:24:55,881 --> 00:24:57,242
there's a couple of additional things

569
00:24:57,262 --> 00:24:58,783
that we need to be thinking of.

570
00:24:58,823 --> 00:24:59,843
This is not implemented yet,

571
00:24:59,863 --> 00:25:01,364
this is just early experimentation.

572
00:25:02,404 --> 00:25:05,086
But if I wanna pick up that red tube,

573
00:25:06,086 --> 00:25:07,807
I can't just teleport into my hand.

574
00:25:08,267 --> 00:25:22,917
What we need to do is we need a way for me to say, I want that red tube, but all of the other people in the space need to see that, hey, Mike is going to take that red tube and allow them to see what's going to happen and be able to intercept and change their mind, basically.

575
00:25:22,937 --> 00:25:24,458
Like, I'm trying to steal something from you.

576
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:25,618
You need to be able to grab it and say no.

577
00:25:28,663 --> 00:25:32,707
Okay, so what are we doing in this space?

578
00:25:32,767 --> 00:25:34,148
We need to bring in things to do.

579
00:25:34,448 --> 00:25:35,829
And when we launched Spaces,

580
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:38,552
the thing that we had that enabled this the most

581
00:25:38,612 --> 00:25:39,172
was the marker.

582
00:25:40,133 --> 00:25:41,674
You could pick it up, you could doodle, that's great.

583
00:25:42,175 --> 00:25:43,396
But really it's a 3D printer.

584
00:25:43,616 --> 00:25:45,898
So in this case, we could play a game of tic-tac-toe

585
00:25:45,918 --> 00:25:46,899
in Space, which is fine.

586
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,061
But you could also spend a little time

587
00:25:49,241 --> 00:25:50,582
and draw all of the pieces of a chessboard.

588
00:25:52,724 --> 00:25:56,128
and then bring in a 2D photo of a chessboard and actually play chess.

589
00:25:56,148 --> 00:25:58,610
You can save all those parts away and bring them back whenever you want.

590
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:02,794
So, you know, we're trying to create an open-ended verb to see what the community would do

591
00:26:03,274 --> 00:26:06,637
with an easy way to construct 3D objects in VR.

592
00:26:07,438 --> 00:26:11,262
This was also wonderful for collaborative design.

593
00:26:11,662 --> 00:26:15,286
This is a kind of a mock-up of the avatar creation that you saw earlier.

594
00:26:16,467 --> 00:26:18,951
We actually did this in VR with Christophe Tassier

595
00:26:18,991 --> 00:26:20,473
as the lead designer on my team.

596
00:26:20,553 --> 00:26:22,256
He and I were in VR together with markers

597
00:26:22,276 --> 00:26:24,921
and we would just draw different affordances

598
00:26:24,981 --> 00:26:26,563
and shapes and whatnot and arrange them in space

599
00:26:26,603 --> 00:26:28,447
and pretend to use them and see how it felt.

600
00:26:29,007 --> 00:26:30,470
That was wonderful.

601
00:26:32,984 --> 00:26:35,988
You can also, in this case, one of my goals for the team

602
00:26:36,048 --> 00:26:38,971
is I want to get my Dungeons and Dragons role-playing night

603
00:26:39,131 --> 00:26:39,612
back together.

604
00:26:39,632 --> 00:26:41,294
All my friends are scattered along the West Coast,

605
00:26:41,354 --> 00:26:42,395
and I want to be able to go into VR

606
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:43,637
and have a D&D game night.

607
00:26:43,777 --> 00:26:46,300
So in spaces, if you go look at the drawing library,

608
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,582
there are dungeon pieces for that reason.

609
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:51,337
But you can also see, it's a little hard to see here,

610
00:26:51,398 --> 00:26:53,639
these fighter characters and the dragon.

611
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,241
This is something that we're just adding to spaces

612
00:26:56,942 --> 00:26:58,603
called photo cutouts, where basically you can take

613
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:01,745
any 2D photo, including your PC desktop,

614
00:27:01,765 --> 00:27:03,827
which is interesting, and with a cut tool,

615
00:27:03,867 --> 00:27:06,168
you can trace lines around and cut out shapes

616
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:07,730
and bring them into VR with you.

617
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:10,191
So you can make any board game piece,

618
00:27:10,271 --> 00:27:11,973
any standee, a mask, et cetera.

619
00:27:12,293 --> 00:27:14,214
So based on what we learned from markers,

620
00:27:14,495 --> 00:27:15,575
we're going to photo cutouts

621
00:27:15,896 --> 00:27:17,817
to allow people to be more creative.

622
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:26,453
Okay, so this is our current UI for exploring Facebook content.

623
00:27:26,533 --> 00:27:27,954
We've recently added a search bar.

624
00:27:28,595 --> 00:27:29,355
I immediately use this.

625
00:27:29,455 --> 00:27:30,376
I grew up in Iowa.

626
00:27:30,856 --> 00:27:31,757
I'm from the Midwest.

627
00:27:32,257 --> 00:27:34,979
So I went in there and I hit the search bar and I typed in Iowa and

628
00:27:34,999 --> 00:27:37,240
I immediately saw a bunch of 360s of the Midwest.

629
00:27:37,841 --> 00:27:41,103
And I was able to sort of wander around my hometown and

630
00:27:41,863 --> 00:27:43,784
look at rolling hillsides from Iowa.

631
00:27:43,824 --> 00:27:44,225
It was great.

632
00:27:44,585 --> 00:27:47,107
So now we've really opened up anything you can think of,

633
00:27:47,127 --> 00:27:48,688
you can search for and find.

634
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:51,770
I'm gonna have to go fast cuz I'm running out of time.

635
00:27:53,184 --> 00:27:54,904
Okay, so I mentioned the PC desktop.

636
00:27:54,944 --> 00:27:56,946
So this is actually your PC desktop.

637
00:27:57,206 --> 00:28:00,468
In this case, this is Brian's Instagram feed

638
00:28:01,268 --> 00:28:03,109
and his favorite dogs, you can see here.

639
00:28:03,789 --> 00:28:07,432
He grabs the cutout tool and he traces around his puppy

640
00:28:07,772 --> 00:28:09,393
and he will get a cutout of his dog.

641
00:28:09,893 --> 00:28:13,254
Now, the thing with the PC desktop is this is literally your PC desktop.

642
00:28:13,334 --> 00:28:15,694
Everyone in Spaces can bring in their PC desktop.

643
00:28:16,015 --> 00:28:18,815
So you can have a LAN party where you're each playing whatever game that you wanna

644
00:28:18,855 --> 00:28:19,455
play together.

645
00:28:19,696 --> 00:28:23,176
You could be all over the country, but you could be together in VR doing that.

646
00:28:24,217 --> 00:28:29,178
And any website, anything on your PC, etc., you can access in Spaces.

647
00:28:29,358 --> 00:28:31,419
If you put your PC desktop in the display center,

648
00:28:31,819 --> 00:28:34,720
it displays on the big screen for everyone in the space to watch as well.

649
00:28:36,439 --> 00:28:40,967
So again, looking for open-ended verbs to express creativity in VR and

650
00:28:41,027 --> 00:28:42,429
see what the community does with these tools.

651
00:28:43,475 --> 00:28:44,336
We talked about dice.

652
00:28:44,796 --> 00:28:46,516
There's a couple, this is a good example of things

653
00:28:46,536 --> 00:28:48,416
that we can do where they're familiar objects,

654
00:28:48,956 --> 00:28:51,277
but we can do things, make things a little easier in VR.

655
00:28:51,717 --> 00:28:53,958
So dice have the properties they do in real life.

656
00:28:53,978 --> 00:28:55,278
You can pick them up, you can throw them,

657
00:28:55,298 --> 00:28:55,958
they bounce around.

658
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:57,718
But of course we show you the numbers

659
00:28:57,758 --> 00:28:59,279
and the sum total, because why not?

660
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:01,799
But also things like, in this case,

661
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:03,079
these two are playing liar's dice.

662
00:29:03,139 --> 00:29:05,660
It's a little hard to see, but you can take your dice

663
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,540
and make them visible to only you.

664
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,001
That doesn't make your dice invisible to everyone else,

665
00:29:10,101 --> 00:29:11,641
but what they see is instead of numbers,

666
00:29:11,681 --> 00:29:12,561
they see question marks.

667
00:29:13,222 --> 00:29:17,007
So we can roll the dice, we can play liar's dice, we're bidding back and forth, and then

668
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:20,212
when it's all over and someone calls you a liar, you can say show to friends and then

669
00:29:20,272 --> 00:29:23,016
all the question marks turn to numbers and you can see what it is.

670
00:29:23,056 --> 00:29:25,760
Essentially having a dice cup in a different way.

671
00:29:30,192 --> 00:29:31,952
And of course, one of the most fun things in space

672
00:29:31,972 --> 00:29:34,594
is continues to be the ultimate VR photo booth,

673
00:29:34,934 --> 00:29:36,875
where you can take all of these creative parts and pieces

674
00:29:37,155 --> 00:29:37,995
that we're providing you,

675
00:29:38,556 --> 00:29:39,796
and people just have lots of fun

676
00:29:39,816 --> 00:29:40,857
goofing around with their friends,

677
00:29:40,937 --> 00:29:42,878
and then ultimately they take a selfie,

678
00:29:43,298 --> 00:29:44,519
and they post it out to Facebook,

679
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:47,820
where the two billion people in the Facebook graph

680
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,541
can see this and start to see what is this VR thing,

681
00:29:50,561 --> 00:29:52,703
and oh hey, this VR thing is interesting,

682
00:29:52,743 --> 00:29:54,383
and I might want to get into it.

683
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,630
So this gets into opening up VR for everyone.

684
00:29:59,071 --> 00:30:01,293
The goal is VR is for everyone.

685
00:30:03,275 --> 00:30:05,216
Selfies, obviously, are the biggest thing.

686
00:30:05,296 --> 00:30:06,538
They're the simplest thing to start with,

687
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:08,900
and as we just described, they're a lot of fun,

688
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,482
but people out on Facebook who don't even know what VR is

689
00:30:11,842 --> 00:30:13,244
can start to see these artifacts

690
00:30:13,424 --> 00:30:14,765
and ask questions and get interested.

691
00:30:17,152 --> 00:30:18,393
We also, as I mentioned at launch,

692
00:30:18,414 --> 00:30:20,336
we integrated messenger video calling.

693
00:30:20,757 --> 00:30:21,939
So from inside of spaces,

694
00:30:22,199 --> 00:30:23,621
you can make a messenger video call

695
00:30:23,962 --> 00:30:25,544
to someone just out in the real world

696
00:30:25,604 --> 00:30:27,186
and they will see a cartoon version of you

697
00:30:27,307 --> 00:30:30,071
and they can interact with the space with you.

698
00:30:33,602 --> 00:30:35,682
We've also recently allowed you to actually,

699
00:30:35,702 --> 00:30:37,622
we've added a keyboard inside of Spaces

700
00:30:37,682 --> 00:30:39,423
so you can respond to your Messenger messages.

701
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:42,403
This, like Search, it's really simple,

702
00:30:42,463 --> 00:30:44,224
but when you go from zero to one,

703
00:30:44,284 --> 00:30:46,284
like I can't do this at all, I have to take off my headset

704
00:30:46,304 --> 00:30:48,705
and go back to my computer to respond, or my phone,

705
00:30:49,285 --> 00:30:51,565
or I can just quickly respond from inside of VR.

706
00:30:52,005 --> 00:30:53,946
It's really game-changing.

707
00:30:54,026 --> 00:30:55,406
It lets you just stay in VR,

708
00:30:56,406 --> 00:30:58,007
and it feels like everything is wide open.

709
00:30:59,832 --> 00:31:01,714
In addition, we launched the ability to go live.

710
00:31:01,774 --> 00:31:03,597
So this is a example.

711
00:31:03,657 --> 00:31:06,000
I was actually on an airplane 30,000 feet in the air

712
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,063
on airplane Wi-Fi watching a live stream

713
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:10,887
of my team testing live streaming.

714
00:31:11,007 --> 00:31:12,970
And I commented, I'm watching you from 30,000 feet.

715
00:31:14,111 --> 00:31:17,173
So when you're in spaces, you see this sort of magic mirror

716
00:31:17,713 --> 00:31:19,114
of the live stream that's happening,

717
00:31:19,154 --> 00:31:20,454
so you can see what everything looks like.

718
00:31:20,935 --> 00:31:22,635
Reactions that people give, like hearts and likes,

719
00:31:22,675 --> 00:31:23,916
they come popping out of the screen,

720
00:31:24,316 --> 00:31:26,517
and any comments show up next to the magic mirror.

721
00:31:26,598 --> 00:31:27,978
So what they're doing here is they reached out,

722
00:31:28,038 --> 00:31:30,319
saw my comment, grabbed it, and pulled it into the space

723
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,420
and showed it back to the camera.

724
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,321
And when I'm sitting on the airplane

725
00:31:33,341 --> 00:31:35,442
and I saw them do that, that was just, it was amazing.

726
00:31:35,462 --> 00:31:38,604
It felt like I was involved in the VR experience.

727
00:31:39,617 --> 00:31:41,558
We plan to do, we want to do a lot more with that in the future.

728
00:31:41,938 --> 00:31:44,520
Here's some examples of, you know, live streams from the community.

729
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:47,482
And there on the right, that's a live stream from Slate.

730
00:31:47,702 --> 00:31:51,345
Slate has started to put on a weekly show called Conundrums,

731
00:31:51,365 --> 00:31:53,146
where they bring in celebrity guests,

732
00:31:53,687 --> 00:31:56,729
and they do a quiz show with them from inside of spaces.

733
00:31:57,229 --> 00:32:01,172
Usually, Lindsay is in New York, and their guests are often in LA.

734
00:32:03,754 --> 00:32:04,274
In the future...

735
00:32:05,756 --> 00:32:08,577
We really want to get to this people-centric

736
00:32:08,597 --> 00:32:10,337
computing platform, and we really want to get

737
00:32:10,417 --> 00:32:12,118
third-party developers involved.

738
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:13,418
We're starting to look into ways

739
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:14,718
that we can make this happen.

740
00:32:15,219 --> 00:32:17,739
So in this case, if I'm there with Rachel,

741
00:32:18,579 --> 00:32:20,040
like I wanted to connect with Rachel first,

742
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,940
then we decide to play, let's play a game of pool.

743
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,241
We didn't launch a pool game app and then invite Rachel in.

744
00:32:25,641 --> 00:32:26,782
I was there with Rachel, and then we brought

745
00:32:26,802 --> 00:32:27,522
the pool table in.

746
00:32:27,982 --> 00:32:30,403
We might decide, hey, this should be in a pool hall.

747
00:32:30,423 --> 00:32:31,923
So put a 360 of a pool hall around.

748
00:32:31,963 --> 00:32:32,723
Like, no, let's do it in a,

749
00:32:33,464 --> 00:32:35,345
in a back alley because, I don't know, why not?

750
00:32:35,966 --> 00:32:37,127
And then while we're playing pool,

751
00:32:37,487 --> 00:32:38,448
we want to listen to music,

752
00:32:38,728 --> 00:32:40,469
so perhaps Rachel brings in her boombox

753
00:32:40,509 --> 00:32:42,331
where she can stream her favorite music service.

754
00:32:43,051 --> 00:32:45,233
These things should all be built by third parties.

755
00:32:45,453 --> 00:32:46,855
They should be brought into spaces,

756
00:32:47,315 --> 00:32:49,337
and we're just starting to explore

757
00:32:49,377 --> 00:32:50,297
how we can make that happen.

758
00:32:50,838 --> 00:32:55,101
So as VR developers, think about how spaces

759
00:32:55,241 --> 00:32:57,383
could be useful to you and let us know.

760
00:32:59,998 --> 00:33:02,560
So again, VR is for everyone,

761
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,141
and we feel like this is one of the things

762
00:33:04,161 --> 00:33:05,882
that we're trying to communicate at Facebook.

763
00:33:07,083 --> 00:33:09,644
I have been in the game industry for several decades.

764
00:33:09,664 --> 00:33:12,226
I was up late playing PUBG, as I mentioned.

765
00:33:12,726 --> 00:33:15,468
I understand that VR is amazing to do awesome games

766
00:33:15,488 --> 00:33:17,109
where you blow up robots and shoot zombies,

767
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:19,350
but I think to get to the kind of scale

768
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:21,211
that we're talking about with two billion people

769
00:33:21,271 --> 00:33:23,252
on Facebook, it's important that we communicate

770
00:33:23,272 --> 00:33:25,353
that VR is for everyone and find other ways

771
00:33:25,734 --> 00:33:28,175
to express the kinds of things that we all know VR can do.

772
00:33:29,485 --> 00:33:31,406
Again, this journey is 1% finished.

773
00:33:31,786 --> 00:33:34,407
Everything that I've said and displayed here could be entirely wrong and

774
00:33:34,427 --> 00:33:35,427
might change by next year.

775
00:33:35,967 --> 00:33:37,728
But these are the things we've learned so

776
00:33:37,768 --> 00:33:39,629
far that we wanted to share with the community.

777
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:43,130
So if you wanna learn more, facebook.com slash spaces.

778
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:44,690
Thank you very much.
