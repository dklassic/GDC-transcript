00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:12,235
Hi, my name is Chris Cantrell. I work in production over at Riot Games, which is a video game company down in Los Angeles,

2
00:00:12,856 --> 00:00:16,138
primarily known for making this game, League of Legends.

3
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:19,705
I actually haven't worked on League in a few years.

4
00:00:19,806 --> 00:00:22,747
Instead, I've been working on this, Mechs vs. Minions.

5
00:00:23,527 --> 00:00:25,628
And Mechs vs. Minions and League are similar in that

6
00:00:25,648 --> 00:00:26,329
they're both games.

7
00:00:26,349 --> 00:00:28,930
They're both from the same world as far as our lore and

8
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:29,630
IP is concerned.

9
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,471
But the primary difference is that while League of Legends

10
00:00:31,611 --> 00:00:34,513
is a video game, Mechs vs. Minions was designed for your

11
00:00:34,533 --> 00:00:35,033
tabletop.

12
00:00:35,813 --> 00:00:38,215
And I think initially this decision for Riot to make a

13
00:00:38,535 --> 00:00:40,996
board game probably blindsided some people.

14
00:00:41,652 --> 00:00:44,734
To be frank, I think it probably blindsided some people internally at Riot.

15
00:00:45,455 --> 00:00:48,937
And why would a video game company, known more for this,

16
00:00:49,838 --> 00:00:51,479
decide to make this?

17
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:53,901
I guess that's what I want to talk to you about today,

18
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:58,565
to go over the story of Next First Minions development from my perspective.

19
00:00:59,265 --> 00:01:01,347
I was the product owner and a part of the design team.

20
00:01:02,107 --> 00:01:05,390
And so I'd like to go over the three-year timeline that I went on to get this game made.

21
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,893
I'd like to talk about how we leveraged our...

22
00:01:09,715 --> 00:01:12,136
our video game development experience

23
00:01:12,256 --> 00:01:15,517
and talk about some of the design crossroads we encountered

24
00:01:15,537 --> 00:01:17,778
and what motivated us as we came to choose

25
00:01:17,838 --> 00:01:18,678
one path or the next.

26
00:01:19,398 --> 00:01:21,759
And finally at the end, I'd like to spend

27
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:23,660
a little bit of time talking about the why.

28
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:25,580
Why did we make this game?

29
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,782
Why was it so important to us?

30
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:34,604
And to be honest, if this talk feels a little bit light

31
00:01:34,624 --> 00:01:37,165
on complex game theory and heavier on

32
00:01:37,953 --> 00:01:41,554
on the motivations behind the experiential design of Mechs vs. Minions,

33
00:01:41,854 --> 00:01:45,795
that's probably because that's where I found our learnings to be the most noteworthy or compelling.

34
00:01:47,956 --> 00:01:51,017
And it's such an honor to be here.

35
00:01:53,918 --> 00:01:55,918
I'll be honest, I'm really proud to tell this story.

36
00:01:56,078 --> 00:01:59,659
It's the story of a video game company trying to learn how to make a board game.

37
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:00,840
And that story...

38
00:02:02,033 --> 00:02:03,914
Starts with this man, Stone LeBrandy.

39
00:02:04,715 --> 00:02:06,055
So some of you might recognize Stone.

40
00:02:06,175 --> 00:02:09,517
He's taught game design classes here at GDC

41
00:02:09,537 --> 00:02:10,277
for over a decade.

42
00:02:10,917 --> 00:02:12,478
But in addition to being a very prolific

43
00:02:12,498 --> 00:02:15,199
video game designer, Stone also, as like a hobby,

44
00:02:15,339 --> 00:02:16,680
designs board games for his family.

45
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,281
Like every year, year over year, he'd sit down

46
00:02:19,301 --> 00:02:20,462
and he'd create a new board game

47
00:02:20,522 --> 00:02:21,862
and he'd show it to his family

48
00:02:21,922 --> 00:02:24,203
and they would all play it at Christmas or whatnot.

49
00:02:24,823 --> 00:02:26,944
And it's exciting to me that the story starts with Stone,

50
00:02:27,364 --> 00:02:29,565
because in a bit I hope to explain why Riot decided

51
00:02:29,585 --> 00:02:30,305
to make a board game.

52
00:02:31,126 --> 00:02:33,807
And honestly, I'm not sure if that answer

53
00:02:33,847 --> 00:02:34,787
is going to make any sense,

54
00:02:34,907 --> 00:02:36,548
unless I can really convey to you what it was

55
00:02:36,608 --> 00:02:37,729
that was motivating Stone

56
00:02:38,629 --> 00:02:40,470
when he would make these games for his family.

57
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,891
So over the years he made a lot of these games,

58
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:46,132
and one of them, the one that Max First Minions is based on,

59
00:02:46,552 --> 00:02:50,114
was called WZD, for Weapons of Zombie Destruction.

60
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:53,552
Now, WZD was a competitive programming game

61
00:02:54,012 --> 00:02:55,292
where you would take these little cards

62
00:02:55,332 --> 00:02:56,392
and put them on a command line,

63
00:02:56,412 --> 00:02:58,053
and that would cause this little robot

64
00:02:58,073 --> 00:03:00,954
to walk around and kill this room full of zombies.

65
00:03:00,974 --> 00:03:02,034
And that was basically it.

66
00:03:02,054 --> 00:03:03,595
There were like 100 zombies on the board at setup,

67
00:03:04,095 --> 00:03:05,455
and whoever killed the most won.

68
00:03:06,195 --> 00:03:07,856
Well, fast forward to about three years ago,

69
00:03:08,516 --> 00:03:10,056
Stone was looking to join Riot.

70
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:12,357
And he was talking to someone

71
00:03:12,377 --> 00:03:13,818
that he'd worked with at a previous studio,

72
00:03:13,838 --> 00:03:14,818
and they're like, hey, Stone,

73
00:03:15,238 --> 00:03:16,638
do you remember that WZD game?

74
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:17,779
Stone was like, yeah.

75
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:18,599
He's like,

76
00:03:19,338 --> 00:03:20,658
We should have Riot make that.

77
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:22,239
And Stone laughed at him.

78
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:24,660
I mean, in his eyes it was absurd that a video game

79
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,261
company might actually want to make a board game.

80
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:28,561
And he told him that.

81
00:03:28,581 --> 00:03:29,762
And the guy was like, no, I'm serious.

82
00:03:29,782 --> 00:03:31,822
I really think this is something that Riot could get behind.

83
00:03:31,842 --> 00:03:34,904
And so Stone was like, look, I'd be happy to give you

84
00:03:34,924 --> 00:03:37,084
the design and I'll even help out and consult on it

85
00:03:37,124 --> 00:03:39,805
if you want, but if you're bringing me in to work at Riot,

86
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:41,906
I'd rather the role that I'm being brought on for

87
00:03:41,946 --> 00:03:44,847
be focused on making video games.

88
00:03:45,047 --> 00:03:46,488
I'm sure he was worried about the little things in life,

89
00:03:46,548 --> 00:03:47,608
like job security.

90
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:52,401
And if we're being completely honest, I'm sure on some level

91
00:03:53,062 --> 00:03:55,303
he wondered what poor fool they would find to drive on the

92
00:03:55,343 --> 00:03:57,204
development of this project that would probably never see

93
00:03:57,224 --> 00:03:57,765
the light of day.

94
00:03:58,925 --> 00:04:01,507
And so that's about the time that I entered the story.

95
00:04:02,908 --> 00:04:04,809
Just some back story on me.

96
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:08,111
I joined Riot about two years earlier, so about five years

97
00:04:08,151 --> 00:04:10,152
ago today, as a gameplay analyst.

98
00:04:10,312 --> 00:04:11,493
It was my first job in games.

99
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:19,004
And a gameplay analyst is just a fancy way of saying that I played the latest balance changes and champions on League,

100
00:04:19,464 --> 00:04:21,265
and then gave my feedback on them to the designers.

101
00:04:22,466 --> 00:04:26,668
Eventually, I got promoted to be an associate QA analyst on the champion team,

102
00:04:26,748 --> 00:04:32,712
and then I moved over to the release team, which is the team at Riot that gets our patches out to our players, as a release manager.

103
00:04:33,672 --> 00:04:39,056
And then, my wife and I, we had our first child, who we named Avalon.

104
00:04:40,014 --> 00:04:42,355
So Don Eskridge, if you're watching this,

105
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:44,755
if you name your next child Mech's First Minions,

106
00:04:45,115 --> 00:04:46,575
my wife says she'll consider us square.

107
00:04:49,236 --> 00:04:52,877
And then I came back from paternity leave

108
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,917
and I joined this area of Riot that kind of focused on

109
00:04:55,457 --> 00:04:57,137
unconventional ways to explore our IP

110
00:04:57,257 --> 00:04:58,198
as an associate producer.

111
00:04:58,738 --> 00:05:01,038
And so here I am, some guy who'd never been a producer

112
00:05:01,078 --> 00:05:03,119
before, who'd never even had any direct reports,

113
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:06,779
and I just got offered to create my own game at Riot.

114
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:08,820
And I was stoked.

115
00:05:09,737 --> 00:05:12,558
I mean, it didn't matter to me that it was a board game instead of a video game.

116
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:16,819
It didn't matter to me that I was terrified beyond belief or felt completely underqualified.

117
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:20,120
I was just like, yeah, I'm making a game.

118
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,421
I was living the dream.

119
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:27,122
Look, I don't want to belabor my inadequacies here because I do know the space.

120
00:05:28,503 --> 00:05:29,583
I love board games.

121
00:05:29,783 --> 00:05:31,524
I love the mark they leave on us as people.

122
00:05:31,584 --> 00:05:35,525
I love the way they impact our relationships and help shape our culture.

123
00:05:37,693 --> 00:05:42,535
Some of my earliest memories are sitting down to play chess with my dad,

124
00:05:43,456 --> 00:05:47,598
or Stratego, or Risk, or Axis and Allies.

125
00:05:49,299 --> 00:05:53,961
I love that board games provide a venue for families to create those types of memories,

126
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:56,722
or an outlet for friends who are just looking to hang out.

127
00:06:00,004 --> 00:06:02,365
So I guess you could say, while I'd never been a producer before,

128
00:06:02,405 --> 00:06:07,148
what I lacked in experience, I tried my best to make up for in enthusiasm.

129
00:06:08,129 --> 00:06:08,629
or passion.

130
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:12,892
I remember I sat down to play WCD for the first time

131
00:06:12,912 --> 00:06:16,435
and it just didn't click for me.

132
00:06:17,856 --> 00:06:18,696
I mean, I liked it.

133
00:06:18,736 --> 00:06:19,517
I loved parts of it.

134
00:06:19,537 --> 00:06:21,378
I just, you know, I wasn't all that eager

135
00:06:21,398 --> 00:06:22,619
to keep playing it again and again.

136
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,100
And here's the thing, I could look around the table

137
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,722
and just see in the eyes of the other folks

138
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:28,022
that everyone else, it just clicked.

139
00:06:28,142 --> 00:06:28,923
They got it, you know?

140
00:06:29,663 --> 00:06:31,405
So I knew there was something awesome there.

141
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:33,666
I just didn't think I could see it yet.

142
00:06:34,687 --> 00:06:35,027
And I thought.

143
00:06:37,528 --> 00:06:38,229
I was embarrassed.

144
00:06:39,089 --> 00:06:40,310
I thought I was a fraud.

145
00:06:41,631 --> 00:06:46,534
And so what I tried to do was I tried to look just as objectively as I knew how at this

146
00:06:46,574 --> 00:06:48,775
game because there were things that I liked about it.

147
00:06:49,456 --> 00:06:54,039
Like it had a lot of the same elements that I loved about Richard Garfield's masterpiece,

148
00:06:54,119 --> 00:06:54,739
Robo Rally.

149
00:06:54,859 --> 00:06:59,442
But it also had some things that kind of separated itself from Robo Rally that I really appreciated.

150
00:06:59,462 --> 00:07:00,382
It was a bit more...

151
00:07:01,223 --> 00:07:03,284
hack and slash feel as opposed to a race.

152
00:07:04,904 --> 00:07:08,266
Stone had managed to kind of capture this visceral feeling

153
00:07:08,306 --> 00:07:09,987
of killing all of these zombies,

154
00:07:10,547 --> 00:07:12,088
like that moment in Dead Rising

155
00:07:12,108 --> 00:07:14,409
where you're kind of wandering through a parking garage

156
00:07:14,429 --> 00:07:15,949
just killing zombies.

157
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:17,550
There's something viscerally right-brained

158
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,051
to offset the more analytical nature

159
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:20,691
that comes with programming out your command line.

160
00:07:21,051 --> 00:07:23,973
So you get a little bit of both types of gamers there

161
00:07:24,153 --> 00:07:25,133
with that approach.

162
00:07:26,074 --> 00:07:29,075
And in game design we like to talk about this thing called power growth fantasy,

163
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:32,776
which is when you go on this journey from starting weak to growing to be,

164
00:07:33,497 --> 00:07:37,539
you know, very powerful, which is just like it sounds, I guess, power growth fantasy.

165
00:07:38,359 --> 00:07:42,241
And Stone had managed to incorporate elements of that by leaving the cards that you would

166
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:46,683
place to program your mech to kind of grow as the game progressed instead of wiping them at

167
00:07:46,703 --> 00:07:51,325
the end of the round. So you could feel your little robot grow into this powerful zombie

168
00:07:51,365 --> 00:07:54,466
killing machine. That's still, I guess.

169
00:07:55,011 --> 00:07:57,051
Even with all of that, from like a timeline perspective,

170
00:07:57,632 --> 00:07:59,932
I went from about here to here, like months of time,

171
00:08:01,073 --> 00:08:03,573
just sort of going through the motions, you know?

172
00:08:03,793 --> 00:08:05,834
Being more excited with the idea that I got to make a game

173
00:08:05,874 --> 00:08:08,234
than actually being excited with where that game was at.

174
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:12,375
And eventually, I kind of brought this to my manager,

175
00:08:12,555 --> 00:08:15,496
a guy who also happens to be my mentor.

176
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:19,817
And I told him that I was making a game

177
00:08:19,837 --> 00:08:21,418
that I wasn't really excited to play.

178
00:08:21,438 --> 00:08:23,798
And I was pretty sure that when I told him this,

179
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,082
While I didn't think I'd be fired,

180
00:08:26,142 --> 00:08:27,904
I was pretty, he'd be forced to kind of

181
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:28,866
take me off the project.

182
00:08:29,586 --> 00:08:32,670
And instead, what he told me was that it didn't matter

183
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,292
if it clicked for anyone else or not,

184
00:08:34,832 --> 00:08:36,134
that I shouldn't be the product owner

185
00:08:36,174 --> 00:08:37,736
for a game that didn't click for me.

186
00:08:38,806 --> 00:08:40,306
And he encouraged me to go back to Stone

187
00:08:40,346 --> 00:08:41,707
and kind of talk through the portions of the game

188
00:08:41,747 --> 00:08:42,907
that I wanted to workshop.

189
00:08:43,287 --> 00:08:45,728
And what I did, Stone was completely ready to collaborate

190
00:08:45,748 --> 00:08:48,288
and was even excited to watch his design evolve.

191
00:08:48,348 --> 00:08:50,349
And I bring this story up because I ultimately learned

192
00:08:50,369 --> 00:08:52,509
something that proved to be very valuable to me

193
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:54,210
that I hope I have the courage to remember

194
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,190
throughout the rest of my career.

195
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:59,031
And that's that you and everyone else on your team

196
00:08:59,051 --> 00:09:02,012
will do your best work if you really believe

197
00:09:02,032 --> 00:09:02,652
in what you're making.

198
00:09:02,672 --> 00:09:06,553
You know, there's a craftsmanship, an artisanship,

199
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:10,843
that comes with passion that's just impossible to fake.

200
00:09:11,463 --> 00:09:14,385
At the very least, I found that I am unable to fake it.

201
00:09:15,785 --> 00:09:17,887
And so, kind of newly invigorated,

202
00:09:17,907 --> 00:09:22,249
I went and I started working on the game in earnest.

203
00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:25,291
And for the large part, it was by myself.

204
00:09:25,311 --> 00:09:26,892
I mean, I'd go and I'd rope in a group

205
00:09:26,912 --> 00:09:29,353
of random playtesters and I'd play with them

206
00:09:29,373 --> 00:09:30,614
and I'd take their feedback and I'd kind of

207
00:09:30,654 --> 00:09:32,875
make some changes and they'd go on their way

208
00:09:32,895 --> 00:09:34,936
and then I'd go and I'd rope up another group

209
00:09:34,976 --> 00:09:36,497
of playtesters and I'd kind of do the same thing,

210
00:09:36,537 --> 00:09:37,618
just rinse and repeat, you know?

211
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,880
And this was very beneficial because in game design,

212
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,602
you have to do frequent play tests.

213
00:09:43,762 --> 00:09:46,264
That's the meat and the bones of game design.

214
00:09:46,284 --> 00:09:48,265
Everything else is just kind of theory crafting, right?

215
00:09:49,186 --> 00:09:51,888
And I'm very fortunate that at Riot,

216
00:09:51,908 --> 00:09:54,410
we have a lot of hardcore board game players

217
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:55,671
that I could pull from.

218
00:09:56,171 --> 00:09:58,794
But I ultimately look back on this era of the development,

219
00:09:59,714 --> 00:10:01,616
and I see it as one of my biggest mistakes.

220
00:10:02,797 --> 00:10:03,397
See, the thing is,

221
00:10:05,186 --> 00:10:07,528
you know, just by nature of them all being different people,

222
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:10,031
each play tester had a different idea

223
00:10:10,051 --> 00:10:11,552
of what the eventual game might look like.

224
00:10:12,493 --> 00:10:14,154
You know, so I talked to this group,

225
00:10:14,174 --> 00:10:15,115
and they'd be like, oh yeah,

226
00:10:15,135 --> 00:10:16,477
I think the game wants to be here,

227
00:10:16,517 --> 00:10:17,437
and I'd work towards that,

228
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:18,819
and then I'd work towards this,

229
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:19,780
and I'd work towards this and this,

230
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,522
and I ended up with a very scattered design.

231
00:10:23,743 --> 00:10:24,984
And I didn't recognize it at the time.

232
00:10:26,755 --> 00:10:30,997
It wasn't until later in the process that I had a core group of playtesters that I could see the difference.

233
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:35,598
And I'll get to that in a bit, but for now, just know that eventually,

234
00:10:35,878 --> 00:10:40,779
every design is going to have to withstand the scrutiny of public opinion.

235
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,480
But initially, when you first start working on it,

236
00:10:44,961 --> 00:10:49,322
it's actually very healthy to have a very core group of playtesters that you trust

237
00:10:49,442 --> 00:10:52,483
until you understand what the game wants to be.

238
00:10:54,470 --> 00:11:00,834
So, by around February 2015, I had felt that I had brought the game to about as far as I'd be able to take it.

239
00:11:01,114 --> 00:11:05,757
And I was ready to move into production, and my stakeholders, they were ready for the project to be over.

240
00:11:06,518 --> 00:11:09,199
And so I told them that the design was about locked, right?

241
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,062
But I still had my doubts. I mean, what if it wasn't any good, right?

242
00:11:13,853 --> 00:11:16,454
And so not knowing anyone in the board game industry,

243
00:11:16,554 --> 00:11:17,854
I decided to turn to the two people

244
00:11:17,874 --> 00:11:18,795
that I turn to as a player

245
00:11:18,815 --> 00:11:20,475
when it's time for me to purchase a game.

246
00:11:20,495 --> 00:11:23,556
I talked to Tom Vassil of Dice Tower

247
00:11:24,096 --> 00:11:25,937
and Quentin Smith of Shut Up and Sit Down.

248
00:11:26,617 --> 00:11:27,377
And I reached out to them

249
00:11:27,397 --> 00:11:28,497
and I asked them if they'd be interested

250
00:11:28,517 --> 00:11:30,458
in coming and play testing it

251
00:11:30,498 --> 00:11:32,258
and telling me if I was gonna embarrass myself or not.

252
00:11:33,338 --> 00:11:35,399
And I think both of them were a little bit taken aback.

253
00:11:36,034 --> 00:11:39,437
I mean, Tom had never heard of Riot or League of Legends,

254
00:11:39,477 --> 00:11:41,019
and Quentin was even pretty adamant

255
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:42,300
that we didn't really need him.

256
00:11:42,521 --> 00:11:44,263
What we needed to do was find a designer.

257
00:11:44,923 --> 00:11:46,445
I told him pretty candidly that I'd already had

258
00:11:46,465 --> 00:11:47,947
a lot of designers come and playtest the game.

259
00:11:47,967 --> 00:11:50,389
I just didn't know if players would like it.

260
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,352
And so he agreed to come take a look.

261
00:11:52,772 --> 00:11:54,534
But Tom came out first, and I remember.

262
00:11:56,831 --> 00:11:57,572
We were so nervous.

263
00:11:59,633 --> 00:12:01,275
He gave us a lot of really insightful things

264
00:12:01,315 --> 00:12:03,697
to do around the game to kind of make it feel more streamlined,

265
00:12:03,737 --> 00:12:06,119
like a first player marker and how to make the turns go

266
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:06,820
quicker and the like.

267
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,162
And after a long day of playtest,

268
00:12:09,703 --> 00:12:12,625
he was like, guys, I don't know why you're so nervous.

269
00:12:13,986 --> 00:12:16,008
I play a lot of prototypes.

270
00:12:16,429 --> 00:12:17,790
This one's actually pretty far along.

271
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,111
I think you have a game on your hands.

272
00:12:19,952 --> 00:12:20,492
We're like, really?

273
00:12:20,512 --> 00:12:21,693
He was like, yeah.

274
00:12:22,977 --> 00:12:25,518
So we're like, okay, well, thank you very much, Mr. Vassal.

275
00:12:25,558 --> 00:12:27,459
And he went on his way and we were stoked.

276
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,721
Like we were strutting around, you know, doing high fives.

277
00:12:30,781 --> 00:12:32,222
And I remember someone even asked,

278
00:12:32,282 --> 00:12:34,503
like, do we still want Quentin to come out and play it?

279
00:12:35,064 --> 00:12:36,585
You know, now that we have Tom Vassal's approval.

280
00:12:36,645 --> 00:12:37,425
And I was like, well, yeah.

281
00:12:38,006 --> 00:12:40,867
Cause I'd never been, you know, more confident in the game.

282
00:12:42,188 --> 00:12:43,609
And you know, his flights were already booked

283
00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:45,090
and I really wanted to meet him.

284
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,030
I'm a fan of his work.

285
00:12:46,531 --> 00:12:48,472
So Quentin came out and played it a couple of weeks later

286
00:12:48,592 --> 00:12:48,672
and,

287
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:52,973
And he was less enthusiastic.

288
00:12:55,294 --> 00:12:56,815
I mean, he said he liked it, but he

289
00:12:56,855 --> 00:12:59,156
wasn't sure why he would get it to the table,

290
00:12:59,336 --> 00:13:00,597
again, when it compared to everything else

291
00:13:00,617 --> 00:13:03,258
in his collection, which wasn't what we wanted to hear.

292
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:07,840
And then he started talking about mice and mystics

293
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:13,123
and dissent and imperial assault and a campaign, where

294
00:13:13,143 --> 00:13:14,163
you would kind of take this core.

295
00:13:16,608 --> 00:13:20,870
where the game could evolve with scenarios where you would take the core programming thing like Stone's Thing

296
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:25,032
and build something on top of it with missions and hazards and a narrative

297
00:13:25,752 --> 00:13:28,973
and you could just tell that as he was describing it you could look around the room

298
00:13:29,013 --> 00:13:32,715
and see in the eyes of everyone that the game he was describing

299
00:13:33,315 --> 00:13:35,416
was just so much better than the game we had made

300
00:13:36,616 --> 00:13:40,778
and in that moment with everyone else listening wistfully to that beautiful British accent

301
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:43,039
the full situation kind of dawned on me.

302
00:13:44,989 --> 00:13:46,730
to make the game the way that Quentin was describing,

303
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:49,271
I would basically have to design 10 games instead of one.

304
00:13:50,571 --> 00:13:51,551
That's a lot more games.

305
00:13:52,212 --> 00:13:55,073
Remember, my stakeholders, they think I'm almost finished.

306
00:13:56,513 --> 00:13:59,894
So I went back to my mentor

307
00:13:59,934 --> 00:14:01,195
and I kind of told him what I'd learned

308
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,376
and what I wanted to do and what I was afraid to do.

309
00:14:03,716 --> 00:14:06,217
And he was like, look, if you believe in it,

310
00:14:06,517 --> 00:14:07,857
then make your case to your stakeholders.

311
00:14:09,138 --> 00:14:09,778
And I was like, well.

312
00:14:10,552 --> 00:14:12,212
Look, it's already been a year and a half.

313
00:14:12,532 --> 00:14:14,913
If I go to the CEO and I tell him I want to reboot the design,

314
00:14:15,173 --> 00:14:16,493
he'll probably just cancel the project.

315
00:14:17,353 --> 00:14:20,514
And he was like, possibly, maybe even probably.

316
00:14:20,614 --> 00:14:22,735
But Chris, what's the alternative?

317
00:14:23,435 --> 00:14:25,096
Do you really want to make a game that you yourself

318
00:14:25,136 --> 00:14:25,676
don't believe in?

319
00:14:28,036 --> 00:14:30,517
So I updated my LinkedIn profile,

320
00:14:30,877 --> 00:14:35,439
and I went back to my stakeholders,

321
00:14:35,659 --> 00:14:38,479
and I told them I wanted to reboot the design.

322
00:14:40,285 --> 00:14:42,407
that I wanted to do missions and a campaign

323
00:14:42,467 --> 00:14:45,949
and 10 different missions and a story

324
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:46,950
that would kind of evolve.

325
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:50,172
And I just kind of laid out my vision for the project

326
00:14:50,212 --> 00:14:52,273
just kind of as articulately as I knew how.

327
00:14:52,794 --> 00:14:53,834
Just pretty confident that they were just

328
00:14:53,854 --> 00:14:54,855
gonna cancel the project.

329
00:14:55,635 --> 00:14:57,857
And well, they didn't.

330
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,820
And I guess in retrospect,

331
00:15:05,702 --> 00:15:07,143
I suspect they saw something in me

332
00:15:07,203 --> 00:15:08,624
that maybe I wasn't looking for at the time.

333
00:15:09,853 --> 00:15:12,254
See, I look in the mirror and I see my failures,

334
00:15:12,774 --> 00:15:14,975
but they look past my lack of experience

335
00:15:15,335 --> 00:15:18,016
and saw someone that really thought

336
00:15:18,036 --> 00:15:20,597
that this was the best way that we could go forward,

337
00:15:20,637 --> 00:15:24,698
that this was how we could best provide value to our players.

338
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:27,118
So they took a look at my prototype pieces

339
00:15:27,158 --> 00:15:29,299
and my prototype art for my prototype game

340
00:15:30,459 --> 00:15:35,581
and we're like, okay, hurry please, but okay.

341
00:15:37,661 --> 00:15:38,122
So I hurried.

342
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:43,066
And it was pretty clear to me that if I was going to get this designed in time, I needed more design help.

343
00:15:43,387 --> 00:15:46,869
So I brought in Rick Ernst, who ended up becoming the lead designer on MDM.

344
00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:50,651
And the two of us worked together to kind of create a series of scenarios,

345
00:15:51,411 --> 00:15:55,194
and mapped out kind of the arc of the story and the campaign.

346
00:15:55,494 --> 00:15:57,855
And then Rick came up with the idea of a damage deck,

347
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:02,138
and communally drafting the command card, since we decided to go fully cooperative.

348
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,443
And the two of us just focused on these daily iterations,

349
00:16:06,483 --> 00:16:08,005
this kind of rapid iteration.

350
00:16:08,025 --> 00:16:09,666
Don't be afraid to fail, but do it fast.

351
00:16:10,727 --> 00:16:11,848
We needed more playtesters,

352
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,832
so we brought in both Nathan Tyrus and Prashant Saraswat,

353
00:16:14,852 --> 00:16:16,814
and the four of us became this core playtest group.

354
00:16:17,955 --> 00:16:19,196
And if I could offer one piece of advice

355
00:16:19,216 --> 00:16:20,778
to people who are in the middle

356
00:16:20,798 --> 00:16:22,399
of playtesting their own games right now,

357
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,501
it's to do targeted playtests.

358
00:16:25,332 --> 00:16:27,294
That's when, at the very beginning of a playtest,

359
00:16:27,354 --> 00:16:29,615
you write down what it is you want to focus on

360
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,876
for that playtest, and it can be anything.

361
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:32,798
It could be game length or tension

362
00:16:32,978 --> 00:16:34,959
or a new mechanic that you've introduced.

363
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,641
But have a very clear focus for that playtest,

364
00:16:37,681 --> 00:16:39,363
and then, at the end of the playtest,

365
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:42,285
revisit it and see what you've learned.

366
00:16:42,825 --> 00:16:45,047
It sounds like such a subtle shift, and it felt like one,

367
00:16:45,607 --> 00:16:47,529
but what ended up happening, coming out of it,

368
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:49,530
was that instead of us talking kind of

369
00:16:50,412 --> 00:16:52,393
empathetically about like, ah, this felt bad,

370
00:16:52,433 --> 00:16:54,976
or this felt bad, we started talking much more strategically

371
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:56,657
around the direction of the game

372
00:16:56,697 --> 00:16:57,738
and kind of where it was heading.

373
00:16:58,419 --> 00:16:59,720
And the game started kind of driving

374
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,842
toward this single coherent vision.

375
00:17:03,484 --> 00:17:05,846
Both Nathan and Prashant kind of joined us

376
00:17:05,906 --> 00:17:07,527
from a background in QA.

377
00:17:08,408 --> 00:17:11,451
And they brought with them this,

378
00:17:12,192 --> 00:17:14,454
like years of practice over at League

379
00:17:14,914 --> 00:17:16,576
on how to properly playtest a game.

380
00:17:17,581 --> 00:17:21,204
And it was like night and day compared to the wandering around in the desert that I did by myself.

381
00:17:22,605 --> 00:17:24,246
So, just keep that in mind.

382
00:17:25,847 --> 00:17:28,529
Eventually, you do want to be able to open it up, but...

383
00:17:30,451 --> 00:17:36,235
I don't think that's the only example of Riot leveraging our...

384
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:40,004
or video game making know-how and applying it to the

385
00:17:40,044 --> 00:17:40,864
tabletop space.

386
00:17:41,485 --> 00:17:43,426
I think another good example of that is that we decided to

387
00:17:43,486 --> 00:17:44,466
publish the game ourselves.

388
00:17:44,807 --> 00:17:46,948
And I'll tell you firsthand that dealing with the nightmare

389
00:17:46,968 --> 00:17:49,170
that is global logistics is not the easiest way to do it.

390
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:51,431
But at this point, we're just kind of used to figuring it

391
00:17:51,471 --> 00:17:52,031
out as we went.

392
00:17:52,792 --> 00:17:54,553
And we got some benefits from this approach that I think you

393
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:58,296
see us leveraging in both League of Legends and MDM.

394
00:17:58,596 --> 00:18:01,418
For one, it allows us to talk candidly with our players.

395
00:18:02,704 --> 00:18:05,846
A lot of times when a designer gives a game to a publisher,

396
00:18:05,886 --> 00:18:08,668
it's the publisher that controls the messaging of the game.

397
00:18:09,469 --> 00:18:14,553
So sometimes a designer, oftentimes even a really big

398
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,294
name designer, isn't encouraged to kind of talk

399
00:18:16,354 --> 00:18:19,016
candidly about what they've learned in their process or

400
00:18:19,376 --> 00:18:20,897
even answer basic rules questions.

401
00:18:21,497 --> 00:18:24,820
Well, Riot, being both a publisher and a distributor,

402
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,520
has taken a different

403
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,941
approach over the years with League, and I was eager to kind of apply those learnings

404
00:18:29,322 --> 00:18:32,884
to this new space. And to be clear, that's not unique to us. A lot of the most successful

405
00:18:33,244 --> 00:18:36,866
Kickstarter games out there really leverage community engagement in very inventive and

406
00:18:36,906 --> 00:18:43,009
creative ways. Another benefit that we got from self-publishing was that we had greater

407
00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:45,851
control over the quality that we were going to be able to provide to players.

408
00:18:46,877 --> 00:18:49,358
You know, a somewhat prevailing misconception was that

409
00:18:49,738 --> 00:18:51,459
Max Trust Minions was just made at a loss,

410
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,419
which isn't true.

411
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,420
We actually make a very similar profit margin, I assume,

412
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,641
as other board game publishers.

413
00:18:57,681 --> 00:19:00,182
But the difference is, we just took all of the money

414
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,303
that is typically allotted to distribution

415
00:19:02,343 --> 00:19:05,144
and licensing out an IP and the retail markup,

416
00:19:05,584 --> 00:19:07,505
and we poured all of that back in

417
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:10,226
to making higher quality game components.

418
00:19:10,266 --> 00:19:12,047
So we opted to paint the pieces

419
00:19:12,087 --> 00:19:15,329
and look for opportunities to kind of push the envelope

420
00:19:15,369 --> 00:19:16,309
a few places in that way.

421
00:19:17,161 --> 00:19:21,783
Because at this point, we didn't just wanna make a game,

422
00:19:21,823 --> 00:19:23,143
we wanted to make an experience.

423
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:28,805
I remember, when I first started on the project,

424
00:19:29,785 --> 00:19:32,706
I watched a YouTube video of Rob Davio

425
00:19:32,907 --> 00:19:35,808
as he was giving a talk right after he'd launched

426
00:19:35,988 --> 00:19:38,569
Risk Legacy, and in the talk, he talked about,

427
00:19:38,589 --> 00:19:39,449
that's him in the corner there,

428
00:19:40,109 --> 00:19:41,069
and in the talk he talked about,

429
00:19:42,503 --> 00:19:44,484
how they had done skin conductivity tests

430
00:19:44,584 --> 00:19:46,565
on a group of board game players over at MIT.

431
00:19:47,305 --> 00:19:49,266
And what they found was that board game players

432
00:19:49,366 --> 00:19:51,267
are the most excited when they play a board game

433
00:19:51,667 --> 00:19:53,168
when they sit down to open the box.

434
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:55,549
And then they go to learn the rules,

435
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,230
and that's where fun goes to die.

436
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:01,932
And to be clear, I stole that joke, beat for beat,

437
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,553
from Rob Davio's Risk Legacy presentation years ago.

438
00:20:05,534 --> 00:20:06,935
And so I thought on that,

439
00:20:08,095 --> 00:20:10,056
and I recognize how absurd this sounds,

440
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:10,236
but I...

441
00:20:11,825 --> 00:20:14,367
I just thought of all the boxes in my life that I really enjoyed opening.

442
00:20:15,588 --> 00:20:19,691
And the touchstone that I landed on was that moment when you first open up an iPhone.

443
00:20:21,152 --> 00:20:24,694
Every piece is kind of thoughtfully engineered in its own specific place.

444
00:20:26,136 --> 00:20:31,940
And for me, it created this moment of ceremony and attention to detail.

445
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,883
Because if Apple cares so much about getting these arguably trivial details perfect,

446
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:41,073
then it kind of conveys a sense of craftsmanship, of artisanship

447
00:20:41,433 --> 00:20:44,635
that carries over to the final product, long after you've forgotten about the packaging.

448
00:20:45,576 --> 00:20:49,278
And for me, that made even more sense to get it right on a board game,

449
00:20:49,298 --> 00:20:52,420
because in a board game, you keep the packaging, you know?

450
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:55,783
You don't throw it out, you have to engage with it each time you interact with the product.

451
00:20:56,966 --> 00:20:59,407
And so, just standing on the shoulders of giants here,

452
00:21:00,408 --> 00:21:02,128
I leveraged Rob Davio's learnings

453
00:21:02,289 --> 00:21:05,270
and I brought it over to Noah Adelman over at Game Trays.

454
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,191
And the two of us came up with this idea

455
00:21:07,231 --> 00:21:10,373
to create a series of trays that would really maximize

456
00:21:11,773 --> 00:21:13,754
that first moment of engagement.

457
00:21:17,656 --> 00:21:18,557
It's an interesting thing,

458
00:21:18,897 --> 00:21:21,678
because you could really tell that the team

459
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:23,519
was really starting to see the game take shape.

460
00:21:24,391 --> 00:21:25,992
like we'd say, like our mantra,

461
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,814
we'll probably never be able to make a game like this again,

462
00:21:28,894 --> 00:21:31,875
so let's just make the best game that we can in this moment.

463
00:21:33,476 --> 00:21:34,397
And we pushed ourselves,

464
00:21:34,797 --> 00:21:37,158
and after hours and hours of playtests

465
00:21:37,198 --> 00:21:38,419
and banging our head against the wall

466
00:21:38,459 --> 00:21:39,340
and squashing minions,

467
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,061
we landed with a game that we were excited

468
00:21:42,081 --> 00:21:42,942
to show the rest of the world.

469
00:21:44,162 --> 00:21:46,804
And then, on October 13th, 2016,

470
00:21:47,284 --> 00:21:51,326
at 11 a.m. Pacific Standard Time, we launched the game.

471
00:21:53,577 --> 00:21:56,658
Not sure if anyone in the world would care that some video game

472
00:21:56,698 --> 00:22:00,019
company had decided to make a board game completely in-house.

473
00:22:01,619 --> 00:22:02,319
And so that's the story.

474
00:22:02,339 --> 00:22:03,519
That's the three-year timeline that I

475
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:04,620
went on to get this game made.

476
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,700
It amounts to me surrounding myself

477
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,201
with far more talented people.

478
00:22:10,401 --> 00:22:12,381
And I guess it ends with me getting up here to speak

479
00:22:12,401 --> 00:22:14,602
to you guys on their behalf.

480
00:22:16,642 --> 00:22:17,202
It's an odd thing.

481
00:22:17,483 --> 00:22:21,403
After we ship the game, there.

482
00:22:22,262 --> 00:22:24,044
there seemed to be a common sentiment that like,

483
00:22:24,144 --> 00:22:26,205
oh yeah, of course, Riot can make a high quality board game.

484
00:22:26,225 --> 00:22:28,447
They probably had like a billion people working on it.

485
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:29,788
And the truth is,

486
00:22:30,289 --> 00:22:31,930
there was really just this handful of people.

487
00:22:33,171 --> 00:22:35,513
And each of these people, myself included,

488
00:22:35,553 --> 00:22:37,235
were all fully dedicated to other projects

489
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:38,115
while we were working on it.

490
00:22:40,457 --> 00:22:42,939
And with the exception of Chris Matthew over at Panda

491
00:22:42,999 --> 00:22:46,002
and Noah, a lot of us had practically

492
00:22:46,082 --> 00:22:48,344
no board game development experience between all of us.

493
00:22:48,524 --> 00:22:49,905
It just kind of hit on a theme here.

494
00:22:50,965 --> 00:22:54,186
what we lacked in experience we try to make up for in passion.

495
00:22:57,127 --> 00:22:58,947
But I don't feel like I've really answered my main question.

496
00:23:00,008 --> 00:23:01,568
Why did Riot decide to make a board game?

497
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:06,209
Was it because we wanted to actualize the potential

498
00:23:06,569 --> 00:23:09,850
of an untapped market in the League of Legends or hobbyist board game mind space?

499
00:23:11,691 --> 00:23:14,772
No. Did we want to optimize our user

500
00:23:14,792 --> 00:23:18,593
acquisition and minimize churn by leveraging unconventional

501
00:23:18,633 --> 00:23:19,653
retention stratagems?

502
00:23:22,179 --> 00:23:23,280
No, that wasn't it either.

503
00:23:24,261 --> 00:23:25,261
I think the truth is we just,

504
00:23:26,022 --> 00:23:28,123
we wanted to make a game that we thought

505
00:23:28,144 --> 00:23:28,884
our players would like.

506
00:23:30,445 --> 00:23:32,707
You know, for the same reason that Stone would come home

507
00:23:32,787 --> 00:23:34,908
after a long day of working at the office,

508
00:23:34,968 --> 00:23:38,151
making games, and sit down and create something

509
00:23:38,191 --> 00:23:41,273
for his family, we wanted to make a game

510
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,295
that we thought our players might like.

511
00:23:45,116 --> 00:23:47,317
And I guess for me personally, I wanted to make something

512
00:23:47,357 --> 00:23:49,879
that one day I could play with my daughters.

513
00:23:52,334 --> 00:23:54,996
I'd like to end with this quote from one of my favorite storytellers.

514
00:23:55,356 --> 00:23:59,418
It's actually very similar to something I heard Mark and Brandon, the founders of Riot, talk about

515
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:06,142
when they first started, you know, thinking about the idea of Riot and League of Legends

516
00:24:07,103 --> 00:24:09,044
and talking to various angel investors.

517
00:24:09,344 --> 00:24:14,067
And at the time, kind of the general sentiment was that PC games were dead.

518
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:16,449
Facebook games, those were the future.

519
00:24:16,469 --> 00:24:18,590
If you want to turn this League of Legends thing into a Facebook game,

520
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,431
then we'll invest in your company.

521
00:24:22,152 --> 00:24:24,213
Like the general sentiment was go broad instead of go deep.

522
00:24:25,994 --> 00:24:30,136
But Mark and Brandon, they really believed in this market

523
00:24:30,176 --> 00:24:31,517
in large part because they were a part of it.

524
00:24:31,557 --> 00:24:32,958
They were a part of the small niche

525
00:24:34,538 --> 00:24:35,999
Warcraft III mod community.

526
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,281
And they'd landed on a game that excited them.

527
00:24:39,661 --> 00:24:40,441
And that mattered more.

528
00:24:41,422 --> 00:24:43,643
You know, reaching this handful of people

529
00:24:43,663 --> 00:24:45,624
in a very passionate way, that mattered more.

530
00:24:47,705 --> 00:24:49,406
You know, these days.

531
00:24:50,171 --> 00:24:52,793
League of Legends has like a hundred million players every month and

532
00:24:52,973 --> 00:24:57,256
and even a very successful board game might only sell 15,000 units and it's entire lifetime.

533
00:24:57,696 --> 00:24:59,978
So if our real goal was just to reach as many people as we could,

534
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:03,540
we probably would have been a lot better off not making a board game

535
00:25:04,121 --> 00:25:06,983
or if we made a board game just like leveraging our IP to kind of

536
00:25:07,383 --> 00:25:10,905
get something that had broader public appeal like League of Legends Monopoly.

537
00:25:13,067 --> 00:25:14,208
But going broad was never our goal.

538
00:25:15,474 --> 00:25:17,395
It was so much more important to us to really resonate

539
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:19,877
in a core way with a handful of people

540
00:25:19,917 --> 00:25:21,558
than it was to reach a broader audience

541
00:25:21,578 --> 00:25:22,519
in a less impactful way.

542
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:27,943
Look, I knew that, I know that Next First Minions

543
00:25:29,063 --> 00:25:30,965
is not a game for everybody, and I'm okay with that.

544
00:25:33,847 --> 00:25:37,389
But when I was making it, I thought of this imaginary

545
00:25:37,429 --> 00:25:38,890
person that I hoped would be out there,

546
00:25:39,651 --> 00:25:41,572
that when they got it, they would be as passionate

547
00:25:41,592 --> 00:25:43,653
about it as we were when we were making it.

548
00:25:45,417 --> 00:25:50,200
And so I'd like to end with this.

549
00:25:52,022 --> 00:25:54,484
Each of us in this room have only a finite number

550
00:25:54,504 --> 00:25:56,245
of projects that we'll ever be able to work on.

551
00:25:56,685 --> 00:25:58,667
So if you take nothing else from this talk,

552
00:25:58,707 --> 00:25:59,748
I implore you, take this.

553
00:26:01,449 --> 00:26:04,452
Use your finite time to make something

554
00:26:04,472 --> 00:26:06,333
that you are proud of, that pushes you,

555
00:26:07,294 --> 00:26:08,795
that you can pour your heart into

556
00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:10,616
and swing for the fences and it terrifies you

557
00:26:10,656 --> 00:26:13,198
just a little bit, pushing you outside your comfort zone.

558
00:26:14,135 --> 00:26:19,336
Look, I don't know if that will ultimately lead to a game that everyone wants to play or not,

559
00:26:19,376 --> 00:26:22,657
but I do know that that game, that's a game that I'd want to play.

560
00:26:24,717 --> 00:26:24,957
Thanks.

561
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,680
And I think we have about four minutes.

562
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:40,441
I'm close to time, but if anyone wants to talk, then I can answer questions now,

563
00:26:40,461 --> 00:26:41,882
or we can go out and do it in the break-in room.

564
00:26:45,742 --> 00:26:47,802
All right then.

565
00:26:47,882 --> 00:26:49,583
I think they want you to talk into a microphone.

566
00:26:49,683 --> 00:26:51,204
Or if you say it, then I'll just repeat the question.

567
00:26:51,324 --> 00:26:51,824
I can make that work.

568
00:26:51,844 --> 00:26:56,806
I just had a random question, because no one else was

569
00:26:56,866 --> 00:26:58,286
raising their hand.

570
00:26:58,967 --> 00:27:00,727
What is your favorite League of Legends champion?

571
00:27:00,747 --> 00:27:03,388
What is my favorite League of Legends champion?

572
00:27:03,408 --> 00:27:05,869
My favorite League of Legends champion is probably Soraka.

573
00:27:05,889 --> 00:27:08,110
You like bananas a lot?

574
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:08,430
I do.

575
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:11,252
I played her since beta as a mid and a top.

576
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:15,302
like pretty pretty aggressive i played kind of an unconventional way of doing it

577
00:27:15,683 --> 00:27:17,971
i'm gonna go with this guy just because he's at the microphone but if if you

578
00:27:17,991 --> 00:27:18,693
want to go to the mic then i'll

579
00:27:19,565 --> 00:27:23,449
Hi, great talk. I'm curious, you mentioned that you know you

580
00:27:23,549 --> 00:27:27,252
tried pulling in random people for playtests. And you felt like

581
00:27:27,292 --> 00:27:29,855
you learned less from them than when you had a dedicated group

582
00:27:29,875 --> 00:27:32,397
of playtesters. And to me, that's that's really interesting

583
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:34,599
is it seems to be like backwards from what I know from video

584
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:37,201
games, which is like, oh, yeah, you want to bring in new people

585
00:27:37,241 --> 00:27:39,083
because they don't have exposure and that they're going to be

586
00:27:39,103 --> 00:27:41,685
seeing things for the first time. Yeah, curious, what was

587
00:27:42,005 --> 00:27:44,347
what did you find that you got from the dedicated playtest

588
00:27:44,387 --> 00:27:46,089
group that you didn't get from brand new people?

589
00:27:46,349 --> 00:27:51,454
So I think over the trajectory of a game's development life

590
00:27:51,494 --> 00:27:53,997
cycle, you definitely want to get to a point

591
00:27:54,037 --> 00:27:56,219
where you want to get it to as many eyes as you can.

592
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,361
So that's not untrue.

593
00:27:58,862 --> 00:28:00,503
But I think the point I was trying to make

594
00:28:00,563 --> 00:28:03,987
is that if you do that too early in the process,

595
00:28:04,527 --> 00:28:07,190
you end up creating a lot of different types of games.

596
00:28:07,611 --> 00:28:08,491
And it's not very.

597
00:28:09,407 --> 00:28:11,389
For me, I felt like it wasn't a very cohesive vision.

598
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:15,172
And I've seen that elsewhere in Riot.

599
00:28:15,372 --> 00:28:19,796
We tried to kind of compartmentalize the R&D efforts or whatnot.

600
00:28:20,777 --> 00:28:21,077
Thank you.

601
00:28:23,439 --> 00:28:24,500
Hello there.

602
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:25,260
Hi.

603
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,302
First of all, as a League of Legends player, I do care.

604
00:28:27,322 --> 00:28:28,283
So, thank you.

605
00:28:29,444 --> 00:28:32,186
Second of all, in the League of Legends community,

606
00:28:32,206 --> 00:28:35,428
I was talking with people as Mechs vs. Minions was announced and it came out.

607
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:37,370
Sorry, got a cold.

608
00:28:39,502 --> 00:28:42,243
One of the prevailing things I saw was there were a bunch of people going,

609
00:28:42,583 --> 00:28:46,304
oh wow, this is so incredible, and then other people were going, ugh, yordles.

610
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:48,285
Um, have you...

611
00:28:50,025 --> 00:28:52,566
Well, it comes back to your thing, it's going to be the game that people want.

612
00:28:52,886 --> 00:28:57,747
But, um, I know you said that we're probably never going to do something like this again.

613
00:28:58,327 --> 00:29:02,789
Have you ever considered doing something like this again or expanding it?

614
00:29:03,149 --> 00:29:04,849
I know you just said no, but...

615
00:29:08,155 --> 00:29:10,537
We're not currently working on any other board games right now.

616
00:29:11,097 --> 00:29:14,099
I think, you know, never say never, we're always listening to our players.

617
00:29:14,939 --> 00:29:18,281
You know, if there's a sentiment that there's a community for this,

618
00:29:18,301 --> 00:29:21,864
then I think that's something that Riot tends to listen to their players on.

619
00:29:22,644 --> 00:29:25,446
And as far as the Ortals go, it's funny because

620
00:29:26,046 --> 00:29:30,549
when I first originally kind of came up with pairing the game,

621
00:29:30,629 --> 00:29:32,310
one of the things that I found was that...

622
00:29:33,944 --> 00:29:37,206
we use like Oriana and Blitzcrank and some of our more sentient robots

623
00:29:37,887 --> 00:29:39,208
from League in the game.

624
00:29:40,229 --> 00:29:43,891
And it felt very frustrating when like Blitzcrank would run into a wall

625
00:29:44,932 --> 00:29:45,272
whereas

626
00:29:45,953 --> 00:29:49,675
like when we moved it to Yordles it felt silly and whimsical and it kind of

627
00:29:49,715 --> 00:29:50,656
created this moment of

628
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:53,438
laughter as opposed to just frustration.

629
00:29:54,198 --> 00:29:56,340
And I thought that the Yordles really kind of

630
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:57,601
helped convey that a bit.

631
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:01,884
Was it always cooperative?

632
00:30:03,313 --> 00:30:03,533
No, no.

633
00:30:03,553 --> 00:30:06,077
Did you want to do that to kind of balance the universe?

634
00:30:06,358 --> 00:30:08,601
No, we started with a competitive game

635
00:30:08,621 --> 00:30:11,105
and we switched to cooperative in part

636
00:30:11,125 --> 00:30:14,770
because I found that the game could be very

637
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:16,272
spiky when it was competitive.

638
00:30:16,352 --> 00:30:18,856
Like if someone drafted the cards that you really wanted.

639
00:30:19,817 --> 00:30:22,498
or if they got cards that really helped make their,

640
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:24,479
it was like the cards that were dictating

641
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:25,940
success or failure.

642
00:30:26,641 --> 00:30:28,422
And as soon as we made it collaborative,

643
00:30:28,822 --> 00:30:30,783
then it was kind of a point of tension.

644
00:30:30,803 --> 00:30:31,663
Like, oh, I really need this.

645
00:30:31,743 --> 00:30:32,344
Oh, I need this too.

646
00:30:32,364 --> 00:30:33,684
That's fine, you take it.

647
00:30:33,844 --> 00:30:34,765
I'll figure something else out.

648
00:30:34,785 --> 00:30:36,226
And it kind of created a really neat

649
00:30:36,566 --> 00:30:37,686
kind of cooperative engagement.

650
00:30:37,947 --> 00:30:40,588
I personally really like cooperative games and board games

651
00:30:40,648 --> 00:30:40,908
because

652
00:30:41,549 --> 00:30:44,770
Like in league, there are like millions of players

653
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,011
that are playing at any one time,

654
00:30:46,051 --> 00:30:47,512
so if I want to get on and I want to play

655
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:50,053
like a game that's kind of balanced,

656
00:30:50,133 --> 00:30:51,374
we have matchmaking to do that.

657
00:30:51,995 --> 00:30:54,216
But you know, if I sit down with like my wife

658
00:30:54,336 --> 00:30:57,558
or if I sit down with like, you know, my grandparents,

659
00:30:57,898 --> 00:31:00,259
like there's a wide range of people

660
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:01,720
where like if you and I were sitting down

661
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,861
and playing chess right now,

662
00:31:03,081 --> 00:31:05,222
and you were like, and you just crush me,

663
00:31:05,783 --> 00:31:07,964
I'd be like, oh, well, do you want to play again?

664
00:31:08,004 --> 00:31:09,725
You'd be like, sure, and then you'd just crush me again.

665
00:31:09,745 --> 00:31:10,505
And I'd be like, oh.

666
00:31:11,263 --> 00:31:11,884
What do you want to play again?

667
00:31:11,904 --> 00:31:13,324
And you'd be like, well, not really.

668
00:31:13,344 --> 00:31:14,404
And I'd be like, yeah, me neither.

669
00:31:14,424 --> 00:31:18,505
And I think with matchmaking, you kind of avoid that.

670
00:31:19,186 --> 00:31:21,286
And in cooperative games, instead of having a friend

671
00:31:21,326 --> 00:31:22,426
who's much more talented than you,

672
00:31:22,726 --> 00:31:24,507
at the game, it actually becomes a benefit

673
00:31:24,987 --> 00:31:26,207
as opposed to kind of a detriment.

674
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:28,868
And so those were some of the thoughts on my work.

675
00:31:29,008 --> 00:31:32,109
As a follow-up, did you guys kind of consider this to be?

676
00:31:33,218 --> 00:31:39,904
detriment to the league player base because they're obviously very competitive and just that alone would did like

677
00:31:40,484 --> 00:31:44,747
No, and the reason why is league is a competitive game, but league is also a cooperative game

678
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:48,050
You know like in order to really succeed at League

679
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:51,073
You need to get good at teamwork and kind of working with your teammates

680
00:31:51,113 --> 00:31:56,497
And that's that's an element of that game too, so if we made a competitive game like that's that's an aspect of it

681
00:31:56,537 --> 00:32:00,060
But you know so is so is cooperation. Thank you. Yeah, no no worries

682
00:32:01,153 --> 00:32:08,342
Do you think the relationship with Riot and League has helped sales of the game somewhat?

683
00:32:08,663 --> 00:32:13,209
And can we assume the fact that you're saying you'll probably never do something like this again mean that it's...

684
00:32:14,625 --> 00:32:20,687
Hasn't taken right by storm, or is it just pocket money compared to league so I didn't hear the second question. I'm sorry

685
00:32:21,448 --> 00:32:23,008
Can we assume the fact you?

686
00:32:24,068 --> 00:32:27,249
You said you were probably never going to do something like this again, right?

687
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:31,251
Can we take that to mean that it hasn't taken right by storm and therefore you?

688
00:32:31,931 --> 00:32:34,912
III think I think riot is very proud of the game

689
00:32:36,215 --> 00:32:37,996
I think we're just always looking at the next hill

690
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:40,257
and trying to find the next thing that kind of pushes us.

691
00:32:41,077 --> 00:32:42,857
And that's more the sentiment right now.

692
00:32:43,438 --> 00:32:46,138
But you know, I loved working on this project

693
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:49,580
and the idea of making more games in this fashion

694
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,520
is very appealing to me.

695
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,420
So we'll see where it lands.

696
00:32:55,802 --> 00:32:57,902
As a lover of board games that are cooperative,

697
00:32:58,162 --> 00:32:59,943
I encounter a lot of issues with kind of alpha gaming

698
00:32:59,983 --> 00:33:01,363
and stuff like that that we all kind of know about.

699
00:33:01,783 --> 00:33:03,684
What are some things you did to avoid those in your game?

700
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:06,637
The timer, the timer was a really big,

701
00:33:06,737 --> 00:33:07,937
actually for the longest time,

702
00:33:08,418 --> 00:33:11,080
if we knew that we were going to do a cooperative game,

703
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,341
the one thing, the only thing that we had to solve

704
00:33:13,541 --> 00:33:14,682
was quarterbacking.

705
00:33:14,942 --> 00:33:17,044
It was like a really prominent thing

706
00:33:17,064 --> 00:33:18,525
in the back of all of our minds,

707
00:33:18,545 --> 00:33:20,746
because we see it as kind of a,

708
00:33:22,368 --> 00:33:24,009
a problem with the space right now, I guess.

709
00:33:24,289 --> 00:33:27,311
And I was really driving on like really,

710
00:33:27,571 --> 00:33:28,972
like I went with like the Hanabi route,

711
00:33:28,992 --> 00:33:30,773
where you like, you can't show stuff.

712
00:33:30,833 --> 00:33:32,515
And like we've thought of all these really kind of,

713
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:36,341
just detrimental ways to kind of remove the ability

714
00:33:36,382 --> 00:33:38,563
for someone to have quarterbacking in that agency.

715
00:33:38,863 --> 00:33:41,645
But what we ended up doing, and Rick talked me out of this,

716
00:33:41,665 --> 00:33:43,786
he was spot on, he was like,

717
00:33:43,866 --> 00:33:44,987
let's just for like a week or two

718
00:33:45,047 --> 00:33:46,168
not worry about quarterbacking

719
00:33:46,268 --> 00:33:48,269
and look to add more collaboration,

720
00:33:48,369 --> 00:33:50,010
more opportunities for.

721
00:33:50,846 --> 00:33:52,966
for you want to engage with your teammates.

722
00:33:53,667 --> 00:33:56,107
And that actually made for a much more fun experience.

723
00:33:56,947 --> 00:33:58,247
So in solving that problem,

724
00:33:58,447 --> 00:34:00,288
I actually made the game much, much worse,

725
00:34:00,348 --> 00:34:01,608
and I'm glad that he came in to kind of

726
00:34:02,168 --> 00:34:02,828
right the ship there.

727
00:34:03,669 --> 00:34:04,809
But I do think that the timer,

728
00:34:04,829 --> 00:34:08,810
and also maybe the complexity of the individual puzzle

729
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:09,330
for each player,

730
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,310
kind of makes that difficult to be,

731
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,530
to feel like you are the, you know,

732
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:16,051
the aficionado on every other person's thing.

733
00:34:16,131 --> 00:34:18,932
Because the decision space there is pretty rich.

734
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:21,519
Cool, and as a last one, with Hanabi being a great game,

735
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,500
what are other inspirational games for you, cooperative?

736
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,360
What, what?

737
00:34:26,061 --> 00:34:27,301
Other favorite cooperative board games.

738
00:34:28,021 --> 00:34:30,502
Oh, gosh, there's a long list.

739
00:34:30,542 --> 00:34:32,883
Pandemic Legacy, I think, is huge.

740
00:34:33,563 --> 00:34:37,184
Robinson Crusoe, Hanabi, I could go on and on.

741
00:34:37,384 --> 00:34:39,725
It's such a rich space.

742
00:34:40,145 --> 00:34:41,125
All right, thank you guys very much.

743
00:34:42,626 --> 00:34:43,606
It was a blast, thanks.
