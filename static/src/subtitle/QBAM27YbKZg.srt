1
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:07,302
everybody. We're going to get started here. The usual first

2
00:00:07,342 --> 00:00:09,504
few words, go ahead and move in towards the center if you

3
00:00:09,524 --> 00:00:12,427
haven't already. Turn off any noise making devices, cell

4
00:00:12,467 --> 00:00:16,150
phones, confetti cannons, just leave them under your seat. And

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,273
remember to fill out the surveys at the end. That's a huge help

6
00:00:19,313 --> 00:00:22,376
to us, lets us know sort of how we did and it's the most honest

7
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:25,799
and innocent feedback we can get. All right. So off to the

8
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:26,079
races.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,821
So as you can see, this talk is about the module level design of Fallout 4.

10
00:00:29,881 --> 00:00:30,981
You're in the right place, hopefully.

11
00:00:32,102 --> 00:00:34,643
And before we really get going, a word of caution.

12
00:00:35,023 --> 00:00:37,464
This talk has a lot of ground to cover. We're going to go fast.

13
00:00:38,064 --> 00:00:41,025
We are going to make slides available. You can find those online after the fact.

14
00:00:41,085 --> 00:00:44,426
So don't worry too much about getting everything down on the screen.

15
00:00:44,466 --> 00:00:47,167
Just try and keep up with us and we'll get through this together.

16
00:00:48,988 --> 00:00:49,188
Okay.

17
00:00:50,122 --> 00:00:52,362
So modular kits, modular level design.

18
00:00:52,602 --> 00:00:54,543
When most people think of them, the first thing that comes to

19
00:00:54,583 --> 00:00:55,463
mind is a Lego brick.

20
00:00:56,023 --> 00:00:57,204
And the comparison makes sense.

21
00:00:57,844 --> 00:01:00,485
Legos are small objects that work together as part of a

22
00:01:00,525 --> 00:01:03,826
system to create something original, which maybe exceeds

23
00:01:03,866 --> 00:01:05,946
the bounds of the original imagination or intentions of

24
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:06,987
the creator of the brick itself.

25
00:01:08,307 --> 00:01:10,207
In a game like Fallout 4, we might think of a structure like

26
00:01:10,248 --> 00:01:12,248
this, something made from a series of interconnecting

27
00:01:12,308 --> 00:01:14,369
pieces working together as part of a system to make

28
00:01:14,389 --> 00:01:16,849
something original that the game developer or the player

29
00:01:16,889 --> 00:01:19,090
created outside of the original intent of the person

30
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:19,630
who made the kit.

31
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,662
So what you might be expecting today is a module kits 101,

32
00:01:23,702 --> 00:01:24,362
sort of a primer.

33
00:01:25,223 --> 00:01:27,185
And that is and isn't what we're doing here today.

34
00:01:27,205 --> 00:01:30,208
This is actually the second time that Nate and I

35
00:01:30,228 --> 00:01:32,129
have talked to GDC about this specific topic.

36
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,031
We were originally here in 2013,

37
00:01:34,071 --> 00:01:35,653
as part of the level design in a day workshop.

38
00:01:37,634 --> 00:01:39,616
And today we're gonna recap some of that talk,

39
00:01:40,137 --> 00:01:42,619
but we're also gonna focus primarily on new ideas

40
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:44,421
and new concepts and lessons that we've learned

41
00:01:44,461 --> 00:01:45,361
since we were here last.

42
00:01:46,958 --> 00:01:48,299
A couple of brief words about who we are.

43
00:01:49,179 --> 00:01:50,360
My friend here is Nate Perkypile,

44
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,721
and he's in Environment Arts with Bethesda Game Studios.

45
00:01:52,841 --> 00:01:54,022
My name's Joel, I'm a level designer.

46
00:01:54,842 --> 00:01:56,803
Nate and I have known each other for about 12 years,

47
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:58,724
worked together on and off throughout that time.

48
00:01:59,164 --> 00:02:00,845
And between the two of us, we've worked on several games.

49
00:02:01,846 --> 00:02:03,627
And of the games that we've worked on together,

50
00:02:04,287 --> 00:02:07,269
all but one of them made extensive use of a modular system

51
00:02:07,329 --> 00:02:08,569
for its level design environment art.

52
00:02:09,553 --> 00:02:12,394
which is just to say that we've been to this rodeo, we've had

53
00:02:12,495 --> 00:02:14,455
several projects in many years to try out different

54
00:02:14,475 --> 00:02:17,316
approaches, find things that work, screw other things up and

55
00:02:17,336 --> 00:02:21,758
just sort of learn. That's not to say that everything up here

56
00:02:21,778 --> 00:02:25,099
today comes from Nate and I ourselves. We owe something to

57
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:27,300
our colleagues in the industry who have also shared their

58
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,961
thoughts, whether it's Lee Perry, Darius Kazemi, Derek Yu,

59
00:02:30,021 --> 00:02:33,782
who are also interested in systemic level design, but also

60
00:02:33,822 --> 00:02:35,563
the entire team at Bethesda Game Studios.

61
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:42,245
And not just the other level designers and the other environment artists who use this process most directly, but the studio as a whole.

62
00:02:43,085 --> 00:02:51,128
Because Bethesda Games Studios is a place that has created an environment to cultivate this kind of workflow and allow it to grow over the space of time that we've been working there and before.

63
00:02:52,643 --> 00:02:54,404
And I think it's important to have this kind of context in

64
00:02:54,444 --> 00:02:56,324
mind in this and really any GDC talk.

65
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:59,606
Because while it's on its face about a specific process or

66
00:02:59,806 --> 00:03:01,886
specific technique that you can hopefully use and apply to

67
00:03:01,906 --> 00:03:04,167
your own work, it doesn't exist in a vacuum.

68
00:03:04,247 --> 00:03:06,528
It comes from who we are as a studio, what our priorities

69
00:03:06,648 --> 00:03:09,089
are, our culture, as well as priorities and the goals of

70
00:03:09,109 --> 00:03:10,550
the games that we hope to create with it.

71
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,651
So today we're going to endeavor not to just give you

72
00:03:12,671 --> 00:03:14,871
the how of some specific techniques, but also as much

73
00:03:14,891 --> 00:03:15,852
as possible the why.

74
00:03:16,152 --> 00:03:17,933
So you can understand our thinking and how we came to

75
00:03:17,973 --> 00:03:20,474
these processes and best understand how to apply them

76
00:03:20,494 --> 00:03:21,294
to your own situation.

77
00:03:24,215 --> 00:03:26,577
So modular level design is something that's been around in

78
00:03:26,797 --> 00:03:29,500
games for a long time. At Bethesda all the way back at

79
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,063
Daggerfall, modular kits were used to build procedurally

80
00:03:32,103 --> 00:03:35,727
generated levels. Marwan had the sort of standard kit approach

81
00:03:35,787 --> 00:03:38,930
where everything snaps together on a grid. Joel and I worked

82
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,593
together on Blood Rain 2 and that was that same kind of kit

83
00:03:41,613 --> 00:03:44,115
approach. It was really obvious to the player that this is a

84
00:03:44,135 --> 00:03:46,618
kit. Everything was north, south, east, west.

85
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,341
Oblivion had the same kind of kits, but there was a lot more

86
00:03:50,381 --> 00:03:52,602
custom pieces for destruction and things like that, so it

87
00:03:52,622 --> 00:03:54,883
worked a bit better. But you could still tell it was a kit.

88
00:03:55,943 --> 00:03:59,144
In Fallout 3 we had standard kits for most spaces, but here

89
00:03:59,164 --> 00:04:01,425
we started to try a lot of new things like directional kits

90
00:04:01,445 --> 00:04:04,125
that only snap together in a certain way, asymmetrical

91
00:04:04,145 --> 00:04:08,567
hallways. Skyrim had standard kits as well, but we tried even

92
00:04:08,607 --> 00:04:11,008
more new things like kits that only went in a single direction

93
00:04:11,048 --> 00:04:12,668
so you could have really specific architecture.

94
00:04:13,571 --> 00:04:15,713
Or the cave kit where there was all these separate pillars and

95
00:04:15,793 --> 00:04:18,355
walls and things that could be mixed together by the level

96
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:20,336
designer to really define the space and it wasn't just

97
00:04:20,417 --> 00:04:21,477
dictated by the artist.

98
00:04:22,418 --> 00:04:24,620
But today we're going to cover Fallout 4 and how we allowed

99
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,942
the level designers to have even more flexibility and a

100
00:04:27,002 --> 00:04:28,063
lot more visual variety.

101
00:04:34,499 --> 00:04:37,001
As promised, this is sort of the 101 section of the talk.

102
00:04:37,181 --> 00:04:38,442
We're going to go over some fundamentals,

103
00:04:38,502 --> 00:04:39,983
and again, going to go kind of quickly through them.

104
00:04:40,823 --> 00:04:42,804
So when we start thinking about creating a kit,

105
00:04:42,944 --> 00:04:44,746
the first thing we want to decide and understand

106
00:04:44,766 --> 00:04:45,906
about the kit is its footprint.

107
00:04:46,527 --> 00:04:48,328
Footprint is, in essence, the grid,

108
00:04:48,428 --> 00:04:50,729
the size of the pieces and the shape

109
00:04:51,049 --> 00:04:52,791
on which they're going to snap and tie with each other.

110
00:04:53,551 --> 00:04:56,234
This is where the comparison to a LEGO brick probably makes the most sense.

111
00:04:56,694 --> 00:05:02,499
The design of a LEGO brick is highly specific, and that specificity is what permits it to work together as part of a system.

112
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:08,104
It also has an effect on what you can build with a kit, and what the look and feel of the final construction is going to be like.

113
00:05:09,045 --> 00:05:11,648
So a typical footprint might be an equilateral cube of volume.

114
00:05:13,356 --> 00:05:15,938
And this is a nice footprint to have because it's going to tile

115
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:18,600
with itself cleanly in all directions. And it's going to

116
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,902
give you a certain type of aesthetic, a certain proportion

117
00:05:20,962 --> 00:05:23,924
of space, like this hotel hallway we see here. It's worth

118
00:05:23,964 --> 00:05:25,426
playing around with the different types of footprints

119
00:05:25,446 --> 00:05:27,607
you can have. For example, you can double the height of that

120
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:30,970
same basic footprint and give yourself the same flexibility

121
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:33,772
in tiling on an equilateral horizontal plane, but giving

122
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:36,074
yourself a different ability to create a look and feel with

123
00:05:36,094 --> 00:05:36,775
additional headroom.

124
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:40,937
You can play around with other axes as well, such as making a

125
00:05:41,037 --> 00:05:43,118
wide kit, kind of like the one Nate was showing from Skyrim a

126
00:05:43,158 --> 00:05:45,679
minute ago. When you're getting into these situations, you want

127
00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:48,680
to be careful, though, about how a footprint can lock you in and

128
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,221
do things like limit your ability to tile and snap back

129
00:05:51,301 --> 00:05:54,462
on itself. It's a point that we made in 2013. So with these,

130
00:05:54,502 --> 00:05:57,104
like, wide footprints, we often call those a one-directional

131
00:05:57,164 --> 00:06:00,245
flow kit because it flows in one direction and can't tile back

132
00:06:00,305 --> 00:06:00,685
on itself.

133
00:06:01,564 --> 00:06:03,266
It's okay to make these kinds of decisions,

134
00:06:03,366 --> 00:06:05,568
but you should try and think about the ramifications

135
00:06:05,608 --> 00:06:07,690
that it's going to have and decide how you're going to cope

136
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:10,033
with the limitations and what you can live with.

137
00:06:11,975 --> 00:06:13,557
Something else really critical to understand,

138
00:06:13,597 --> 00:06:14,979
something I think a lot of people misunderstand

139
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,100
when they start in this workflow,

140
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,763
is you need to treat the footprint as a maximum extents

141
00:06:19,283 --> 00:06:21,105
of the piece, not sort of as a starting point.

142
00:06:22,068 --> 00:06:23,808
So this is another example from our prior talk.

143
00:06:24,168 --> 00:06:25,789
Now if you look, we have two pieces,

144
00:06:25,929 --> 00:06:27,249
identical pieces of a hallway kit,

145
00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:28,429
pushed right up next to each other.

146
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:30,010
Now if you focus on the floor,

147
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,730
you'll see that the artist has built

148
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,711
all the way out to the footprint on the tiling edge,

149
00:06:33,771 --> 00:06:35,451
which you have to do, that's how the pieces

150
00:06:35,491 --> 00:06:37,051
are going to meet and tile, make the kit work.

151
00:06:37,532 --> 00:06:39,172
But the artist also built all the way out

152
00:06:39,192 --> 00:06:40,472
to the edge of the footprint on the floor

153
00:06:40,532 --> 00:06:42,433
on the other non-tiling edge, where the walls are.

154
00:06:43,033 --> 00:06:44,594
What this means is that the walls of that kit are going to

155
00:06:44,614 --> 00:06:46,516
be coplanar. They're not going to occlude. They're going to

156
00:06:46,636 --> 00:06:49,358
have Z-flickering problems. You can't do that. Even worse,

157
00:06:49,518 --> 00:06:51,620
there's a little alcove detail built into the kit, even at

158
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,082
this gray box level. And those alcoves are now going to

159
00:06:54,142 --> 00:06:56,123
intersect and protrude into the neighboring pieces. I mean,

160
00:06:56,163 --> 00:06:59,486
you can't use a kit in this very basic way. If instead we had

161
00:06:59,706 --> 00:07:03,529
used the footprint as a maximum extents and left a buffer, we

162
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:05,511
could use it just like this, no problem at all.

163
00:07:06,871 --> 00:07:08,172
Pivot points are also very important.

164
00:07:09,192 --> 00:07:11,533
Pivot points judge how you're going to work with the kit,

165
00:07:11,613 --> 00:07:13,094
how it's going to snap mathematically,

166
00:07:13,794 --> 00:07:15,735
and they have to be really nailed down early on.

167
00:07:16,776 --> 00:07:18,376
So we take example of a couple of kit pieces

168
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,097
from Fallout 4.

169
00:07:19,777 --> 00:07:20,357
Here we have two.

170
00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:25,421
The one in the middle of the screen is a basic sort of floor ceiling piece and its pivot

171
00:07:25,441 --> 00:07:28,222
point is at the bottom center, which is the most common place to have a pivot point.

172
00:07:28,622 --> 00:07:32,104
But the highlighted blue piece, that little clam shell on the side, it has a pivot point

173
00:07:32,164 --> 00:07:32,864
at the bottom edge.

174
00:07:33,285 --> 00:07:36,706
Both cases are going to snap mathematically fine based on the grid, the footprint that

175
00:07:36,746 --> 00:07:39,688
these ones are using, but it does affect how you work with this piece.

176
00:07:40,628 --> 00:07:44,752
As long as it's mathematically accurate, it is to a certain extent a matter of personal preference.

177
00:07:45,172 --> 00:07:48,655
But once you've nailed down the pivot point that you have on a certain piece,

178
00:07:49,036 --> 00:07:50,577
you want to make sure that you don't change it.

179
00:07:50,957 --> 00:07:52,599
Because the minute that you change a pivot point,

180
00:07:52,799 --> 00:07:55,801
you're going to undermine any work that level designers have already done with those pieces.

181
00:07:59,965 --> 00:08:02,908
Something else that we haven't always been great about, but we try to improve in Fallout 4,

182
00:08:03,328 --> 00:08:04,849
was standardizing our transitions.

183
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,472
The best example of this would be a simple doorway.

184
00:08:08,384 --> 00:08:10,813
Early on in the game we chose a single wide and a double wide

185
00:08:10,873 --> 00:08:13,845
door frame size. We made sure those dimensions were 1-0 to the

186
00:08:13,885 --> 00:08:14,045
team.

187
00:08:15,235 --> 00:08:19,838
And we used those consistently throughout all the different kits, so every kit didn't have to solve doorways its own way.

188
00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:27,084
This gave us the ability to use door art interchangeably, but also more critically, it allows us to mix and match as level designers between different kits.

189
00:08:27,504 --> 00:08:34,189
So if we want to go from a basement to a brick to a hotel, we can do this fluidly without having to get custom art to handle every single case.

190
00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:41,415
It's also useful for character artists and animators because it gives them a known quantity in terms of the smallest choke point that our characters have to be able to navigate.

191
00:08:43,852 --> 00:08:46,314
Looking at some sort of alternative and sort of beyond

192
00:08:46,334 --> 00:08:49,056
the basics techniques, one thing that we've talked about before

193
00:08:49,116 --> 00:08:51,858
are layered inserts we use with a base kit. Best example of this

194
00:08:51,918 --> 00:08:55,841
remains from Skyrim. If we take a look at a very simple cave

195
00:08:55,881 --> 00:08:58,383
layout that's made with a traditional grid system, it

196
00:08:58,423 --> 00:09:00,685
doesn't look like a cave at all. We have this unnatural grid

197
00:09:00,825 --> 00:09:03,307
corner in the edge of it. So what we do is we bring in these

198
00:09:03,367 --> 00:09:06,109
layered insert pieces that go floor to ceiling, and what these

199
00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:08,391
do is allow us to shear off the unnatural corner.

200
00:09:09,332 --> 00:09:11,834
By themselves these pieces have bad texture seams and gaps,

201
00:09:12,354 --> 00:09:14,556
but we can easily cover those up with boulders, pillars,

202
00:09:14,636 --> 00:09:17,558
free-floating pieces, and even after the most rudimentary

203
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,420
lighting paths, we have something which begins to feel

204
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,620
much more naturalistic.

205
00:09:21,421 --> 00:09:23,323
We relied on this extensively in Skyrim,

206
00:09:23,343 --> 00:09:26,025
where we had to create so many caves and natural interiors,

207
00:09:26,445 --> 00:09:28,607
but we found ways to apply it forward into Fallout 4,

208
00:09:28,647 --> 00:09:30,748
because it was such a useful part of our workflow in Skyrim.

209
00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:33,450
Being able to do things like create sweeping architectural

210
00:09:33,511 --> 00:09:35,152
curves and lines inside an environment,

211
00:09:35,372 --> 00:09:36,793
without having to make custom art to handle

212
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,655
every time we were interested in trying something like this.

213
00:09:40,673 --> 00:09:42,835
Something else we rely on extensively, which really

214
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,738
boils down to an editor feature, is the ability to specify

215
00:09:45,778 --> 00:09:46,919
a local snap parent.

216
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:48,680
Some other editors have this feature

217
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,721
and call it a custom grid.

218
00:09:50,522 --> 00:09:51,683
So when we're creating a new space,

219
00:09:51,703 --> 00:09:53,105
we will tend to work off the origin,

220
00:09:53,245 --> 00:09:55,026
snapping along the world grid coordinates.

221
00:09:55,567 --> 00:09:57,469
And that's all fine, and it snaps perfectly.

222
00:09:58,109 --> 00:10:00,151
But sooner or later, we're going to want to rotate off

223
00:10:00,191 --> 00:10:02,013
at some arbitrary orientation and start

224
00:10:02,053 --> 00:10:03,014
tiling in a new direction.

225
00:10:03,835 --> 00:10:08,276
What we can do in our editor is we can point to this new snap reference and essentially treat it as a new origin

226
00:10:08,616 --> 00:10:13,238
and then snap along with kit logic and mathematical precision on whatever arbitrary direction we want.

227
00:10:14,198 --> 00:10:20,320
This allows us to create sort of meandering flowing layouts that are dictated by the needs and the whims of level design

228
00:10:20,701 --> 00:10:23,962
rather than always being locked into custom art to get us off the grid and back on again.

229
00:10:24,282 --> 00:10:27,083
All we have to worry about is areas where we transition from one grid to the other.

230
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:33,188
One specific type of kit we use a little infrequently is called

231
00:10:33,228 --> 00:10:36,569
the pivot and flange. We use pivot and flange kits in

232
00:10:36,609 --> 00:10:39,210
Fallout 4. We also use them in Skyrim where this example is

233
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:42,832
from. And this is what we call the ratway kit. It's under the

234
00:10:43,032 --> 00:10:46,293
city of Riften in Skyrim. And this is a one directional flow

235
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:48,974
kit, basic hallway pieces which snap together. And the pivot

236
00:10:48,994 --> 00:10:51,396
point on these exists at the end and we're able to swing them

237
00:10:51,436 --> 00:10:53,977
around and within a certain threshold create these gaps and

238
00:10:53,997 --> 00:10:54,637
these overlaps.

239
00:10:55,297 --> 00:10:59,281
We have an archway piece which seals that in and covers it visually and lights nicely.

240
00:10:59,882 --> 00:11:03,886
And that's good for creating space which would feel like once upon a time long ago,

241
00:11:03,946 --> 00:11:08,571
they may have been built on a straightened level, but they over time have settled into a more interesting organic shape.

242
00:11:11,092 --> 00:11:14,915
Now, this stuff we did cover more or less in 2013 and we

243
00:11:14,935 --> 00:11:17,396
went into a lot more detail with it. So if you're interested

244
00:11:17,436 --> 00:11:20,458
in more on this stuff, by all means, that talk is available

245
00:11:20,538 --> 00:11:23,160
online. It's free. It's in written form. It's been

246
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,801
localized in different languages. Go check it out. But

247
00:11:25,861 --> 00:11:27,803
today we didn't want to just give that talk again with some

248
00:11:27,863 --> 00:11:29,784
updates because we're always kind of looking forward and

249
00:11:29,824 --> 00:11:32,485
thinking about where we can go next with our workflow. We never

250
00:11:32,546 --> 00:11:34,607
assume that we figured out the best way to make the game we

251
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:35,968
were making. And even if we had,

252
00:11:36,848 --> 00:11:38,869
the needs of the next game are going to be different

253
00:11:38,929 --> 00:11:40,969
and need to affect the workflow, it goes hand in hand.

254
00:11:41,449 --> 00:11:43,210
And I think it's important to have this willingness

255
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,630
to experiment with your process,

256
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,451
to always be striving to improve.

257
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:49,271
But you do want to be methodical about that,

258
00:11:49,431 --> 00:11:51,512
have calculated experiments in how you approach it.

259
00:11:52,092 --> 00:11:54,013
If you have a consistent set of goals in mind

260
00:11:54,053 --> 00:11:55,773
that you're working incrementally towards,

261
00:11:56,153 --> 00:11:57,794
you will tend to achieve them over time.

262
00:11:57,814 --> 00:11:59,714
There'll be some dead ends and missteps along the way,

263
00:12:00,134 --> 00:12:02,735
but you're going to improve if you choose a vector

264
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:03,375
and work along it.

265
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:07,178
Sometimes we can get into workflow ideas and tool set

266
00:12:07,218 --> 00:12:09,940
changes which seem interesting but if they don't have the

267
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,821
long-term goals in mind we can end up with something that's

268
00:12:11,942 --> 00:12:15,624
different but not necessarily better. And if you truly

269
00:12:15,664 --> 00:12:17,666
misunderstand what worked well about a workflow before you

270
00:12:17,686 --> 00:12:19,867
start making changes to it, you can end up with something worse

271
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:27,973
off than how you began. So yeah, once upon a time we worked on a

272
00:12:27,993 --> 00:12:30,435
game called Skyrim and then we transitioned to Fallout 4.

273
00:12:31,782 --> 00:12:33,586
So we think about the overall world direction,

274
00:12:33,626 --> 00:12:36,130
the world building, the sweeping fantasy landscapes

275
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,733
and the setting of a game like Skyrim

276
00:12:37,994 --> 00:12:39,437
are inherently different in several ways

277
00:12:39,857 --> 00:12:42,182
than the dense compound mixed-use urban environment

278
00:12:42,222 --> 00:12:43,664
of Boston and the surrounding commonwealth.

279
00:12:44,492 --> 00:12:47,094
So as we start thinking about the world and what needs to be in it,

280
00:12:47,474 --> 00:12:50,997
we think about where players are going to go, where are they going to meet people, adventure.

281
00:12:51,297 --> 00:12:54,199
What sorts of environments do we need just to create the texture of the world

282
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:57,442
and do a good representation of the location we have chosen?

283
00:12:58,262 --> 00:13:00,904
And as this vision of the world begins to coalesce and take shape,

284
00:13:01,244 --> 00:13:04,207
we can take one of our first really concrete steps forward in production,

285
00:13:04,607 --> 00:13:08,810
which is defining the kits that we need to create in order to support building all of these locations.

286
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:10,131
So that's what we did.

287
00:13:10,171 --> 00:13:11,531
We kind of went through all the locations

288
00:13:11,571 --> 00:13:12,832
and came up with the kits that we thought

289
00:13:12,852 --> 00:13:13,452
we'd have to build.

290
00:13:14,033 --> 00:13:15,833
And we apply our conventional logic to this,

291
00:13:15,894 --> 00:13:18,015
which is to analyze which environments

292
00:13:18,055 --> 00:13:19,615
are going to be built with these kits,

293
00:13:19,775 --> 00:13:21,896
how robust, how important, how extensive

294
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:23,157
are they going to be, how much time

295
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,518
do we have in the schedule, and then we start

296
00:13:25,578 --> 00:13:27,199
building out, you know, when each kit's

297
00:13:27,219 --> 00:13:28,340
gonna be available to work with.

298
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,521
Now it's important to understand that every kit

299
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:32,702
has a certain amount of overhead.

300
00:13:32,722 --> 00:13:34,623
It has baggage, and it takes a lot of time.

301
00:13:34,763 --> 00:13:35,903
Kits are a commitment.

302
00:13:37,032 --> 00:13:39,693
You know, if we have 10 kits that are of a certain

303
00:13:39,733 --> 00:13:42,614
complexity and five kits that are twice as complex,

304
00:13:42,654 --> 00:13:45,376
it takes longer to create the 10 less complex kits

305
00:13:45,436 --> 00:13:48,117
because you have to figure out how is the kit going to work,

306
00:13:48,437 --> 00:13:49,938
what pieces do we need to establish,

307
00:13:50,318 --> 00:13:52,279
getting people up to speed on how the kit is going

308
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:54,820
to function, reacting to requests, feedback, bugs,

309
00:13:55,141 --> 00:13:57,262
and the ongoing visual and cosmetic ownership

310
00:13:57,302 --> 00:13:58,782
and iteration of the kit itself.

311
00:13:59,903 --> 00:14:02,564
And so, knowing this and looking at the long list of kits

312
00:14:02,664 --> 00:14:04,065
we need at the beginning of Fallout 4

313
00:14:04,445 --> 00:14:05,726
is about when our allergies kick in.

314
00:14:06,853 --> 00:14:09,419
we're really cognizant of time at Bethesda Game Studios.

315
00:14:10,241 --> 00:14:11,704
Even under the best of circumstances,

316
00:14:11,744 --> 00:14:12,907
our games take years to make.

317
00:14:14,064 --> 00:14:16,446
small inefficiencies, redundancies in our workflow.

318
00:14:16,826 --> 00:14:18,608
These time sinks can really set us back.

319
00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:21,070
And critically what they do is they prevent us

320
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,992
from getting to a point where the game is playable.

321
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,475
The faster we can get to playable, the better,

322
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,597
because we strongly believe that the first time

323
00:14:27,637 --> 00:14:29,999
a piece of content is playable is really the first time

324
00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:32,201
you can meaningfully critique it and decide how to iterate.

325
00:14:32,741 --> 00:14:34,323
And having all these kits we had to build

326
00:14:34,343 --> 00:14:36,805
was going to delay us getting to that first playable point

327
00:14:37,146 --> 00:14:39,108
with all of the different environments that required them.

328
00:14:40,792 --> 00:14:44,174
So it's through this lens that we returned to that list of kits and we looked at them differently.

329
00:14:44,194 --> 00:14:50,679
And what we realized was for the most part this list was defined by the usage of the space before the apocalypse.

330
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,562
And several of these kits had something in common,

331
00:14:54,022 --> 00:14:58,846
which was that they followed similar construction techniques in terms of how they would have been built in the real world.

332
00:14:59,246 --> 00:15:04,750
Foundations, supports, pillars, you know, plaster, brick, the finishes and the building materials might have changed,

333
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:09,154
but the general function and the general proportion of the spaces more or less were the same.

334
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:13,101
We try to think of kits as solutions to specific problems

335
00:15:13,861 --> 00:15:17,204
and to make sure that every kit justifies its own existence.

336
00:15:17,804 --> 00:15:19,145
Again, we're looking for redundancies

337
00:15:19,165 --> 00:15:20,266
and ways to iron these things out.

338
00:15:20,806 --> 00:15:22,708
And what we realize is that all of these kits

339
00:15:22,768 --> 00:15:24,989
were solving a similar problem in terms of

340
00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:27,171
the type of construction method used to build them.

341
00:15:27,591 --> 00:15:29,753
And we could consolidate them down into one larger,

342
00:15:29,813 --> 00:15:32,335
much more robust kit that we'd simply call the building kit.

343
00:15:32,635 --> 00:15:34,356
And the building kit is gonna be the primary example

344
00:15:34,396 --> 00:15:35,357
we use to analyze today.

345
00:15:39,092 --> 00:15:42,173
So like Joel said, the building kit was used to build a lot of

346
00:15:42,213 --> 00:15:45,334
spaces for fallout 4. But this had its roots all the way back

347
00:15:45,374 --> 00:15:48,675
in fallout 3 with the office kit by Robert Wozniewski. This was

348
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,735
a sort of standard kit, everything snapped together on a

349
00:15:50,795 --> 00:15:53,116
grid. But it was called the office kit for a reason. If you

350
00:15:53,136 --> 00:15:56,077
wanted to build an attic or a basement, you either had to use

351
00:15:56,097 --> 00:15:58,818
a completely different kit or you just couldn't do it because

352
00:15:58,858 --> 00:15:59,478
it didn't exist.

353
00:16:00,442 --> 00:16:02,463
So we wanted to take all those different construction types

354
00:16:02,763 --> 00:16:05,545
and unify it. So we could just start by building one, level

355
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:08,388
designers can keep working, and then we can swap it out later as

356
00:16:08,428 --> 00:16:11,550
those come online. And this had a lot of our standard stuff that

357
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,332
we have in all the kits. Small halls, medium halls, large

358
00:16:14,372 --> 00:16:17,795
halls, so on. But the way we built the piece this time was

359
00:16:17,855 --> 00:16:18,195
different.

360
00:16:19,092 --> 00:16:21,575
Previously when we built a piece you would Frankenstein it

361
00:16:21,595 --> 00:16:24,679
together in max. But if you needed to update a door frame

362
00:16:24,699 --> 00:16:26,742
you would have to go through each one of those and update it.

363
00:16:27,222 --> 00:16:30,186
So it was a ton of redundant work. So you would export out a

364
00:16:30,226 --> 00:16:33,190
piece and here's your piece. It's one big package deal. There

365
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:33,430
it is.

366
00:16:34,647 --> 00:16:37,851
but this time around we assemble the pieces in the editor and it

367
00:16:37,911 --> 00:16:40,654
ends up looking like this. So it's composed of all these

368
00:16:40,674 --> 00:16:43,637
component parts of the floor, the wall and the ceiling. So

369
00:16:43,657 --> 00:16:46,220
your actual kit ends up looking like this. Instead of just

370
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,382
building all those possibilities, you're spending

371
00:16:48,422 --> 00:16:51,285
time on visual variants and the actual capabilities of the kit.

372
00:16:52,953 --> 00:16:55,614
This lets us do a lot more things with destruction. We can

373
00:16:55,634 --> 00:16:58,756
just swap out parts of it for a different kit entirely. Layouts

374
00:16:58,796 --> 00:17:01,677
can do whatever. And if we want to build a new piece, we can

375
00:17:01,697 --> 00:17:03,958
just do that. In the old work flow, if I had a corner piece

376
00:17:04,338 --> 00:17:06,279
and I have a door on the left and a window on the right,

377
00:17:06,499 --> 00:17:08,660
that's a piece. What if it's a door on the left and a double

378
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,541
door on the right, another piece? Every time you add

379
00:17:11,621 --> 00:17:13,822
functionality to the kit, you would have more and more pieces

380
00:17:13,842 --> 00:17:16,142
and you would easily have hundreds if not thousands of

381
00:17:16,183 --> 00:17:18,323
pieces. But now you can just swap it out.

382
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:21,582
And that's the main thing we've done, is we've taken the kit

383
00:17:21,722 --> 00:17:22,603
and broken it apart.

384
00:17:22,784 --> 00:17:24,587
And that's given us a lot more flexibility.

385
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:30,677
I want to take a few minutes to talk about how this shift to a

386
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:32,641
more granular style of kit affected

387
00:17:32,721 --> 00:17:33,682
workflow for level design.

388
00:17:34,922 --> 00:17:38,723
Now the notion of going more granular isn't something that may seem really, you know,

389
00:17:39,424 --> 00:17:44,886
earth-shaking or, you know, inventive to an outside observer, but it had a lot of repercussions

390
00:17:44,946 --> 00:17:45,607
on how we built.

391
00:17:45,907 --> 00:17:49,268
And it's something that we had experimented with at small scales before, but this time

392
00:17:49,308 --> 00:17:50,369
we kind of went all in.

393
00:17:50,829 --> 00:17:54,331
You know, and the main benefit, the obvious benefit, is it gives us a lot more flexibility.

394
00:17:54,631 --> 00:17:58,753
But there are reasons in terms of, you know, tech and logistics and workflow that we hadn't

395
00:17:58,913 --> 00:18:00,113
gone in this deep with it before.

396
00:18:00,634 --> 00:18:03,055
and the one we'll focus on right now is the workflow,

397
00:18:03,095 --> 00:18:05,717
because working this way is inherently more time consuming.

398
00:18:06,497 --> 00:18:08,899
So if you take a really basic blocked in space,

399
00:18:08,939 --> 00:18:10,960
like this simple room with a couple of hallway stems,

400
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,822
using traditional sort of clamshell style of kit,

401
00:18:13,982 --> 00:18:16,663
we can create this space in 20 clicks, right?

402
00:18:16,744 --> 00:18:17,884
20 objects dragged into the editor.

403
00:18:18,645 --> 00:18:20,606
But if you take this very primitive layout

404
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,188
and you explode it into the more granular sub-parts

405
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:24,328
that Nate was talking about,

406
00:18:24,829 --> 00:18:26,870
now the object count balloons up to 123 objects

407
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:27,290
from the original 20.

408
00:18:29,852 --> 00:18:31,633
So this is one of the moments where we have to think about

409
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:35,075
how our existing workflow has made us strong at what we do,

410
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:38,077
but what we can do to make sure we expose ourselves

411
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,819
to the power of the new workflow that we want to embrace.

412
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:46,262
Nate mentioned this in passing, but how we did this was with an editor tool called a

413
00:18:46,302 --> 00:18:48,082
pack-in, which is essentially a prefab.

414
00:18:48,643 --> 00:18:52,504
So we could use the more granular pieces and collect them together on the editor side into

415
00:18:52,544 --> 00:18:53,104
a prefab.

416
00:18:53,244 --> 00:18:56,985
And those prefabs were named with the naming conventions we were used to in the traditional

417
00:18:57,005 --> 00:19:00,346
style of kit, organized into different parts of the editor, and we could quickly rough

418
00:19:00,386 --> 00:19:02,807
out spaces in our existing workflow which we were comfortable with.

419
00:19:03,247 --> 00:19:06,111
And then once we knew that the layout wasn't going to fundamentally change,

420
00:19:06,131 --> 00:19:07,733
and we had iterated and agreed on that,

421
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:11,598
we could then, as needed, explode out the pieces into the subcomponent parts,

422
00:19:12,019 --> 00:19:14,422
and do visible variations and one-offs as needed.

423
00:19:15,868 --> 00:19:21,089
This all kind of speaks to the priority that we put on things being ready and being ready at a certain time.

424
00:19:21,929 --> 00:19:24,789
Kits are absolutely fundamental to the way level designers work at Bethesda.

425
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:29,070
We literally don't have primitive geometry tools in the editor. It's the only way we're able to work.

426
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:31,811
And because of this, we front load these into the art schedule.

427
00:19:31,831 --> 00:19:35,371
We work with production and environment art to make sure that they're some of the first things made in the game.

428
00:19:37,772 --> 00:19:40,272
Now, level design doesn't mind that they're of grey box quality early on,

429
00:19:40,332 --> 00:19:43,033
as long as we have the proportions and naming conventions that we need to work with.

430
00:19:43,093 --> 00:19:45,553
They're going to visually get better and better throughout the game.

431
00:19:46,817 --> 00:19:50,617
The main thing is that early on we know that those kit pieces are pretty solid, that they're

432
00:19:50,637 --> 00:19:51,277
trustworthy.

433
00:19:52,118 --> 00:19:55,018
This gets a little bit into how we schedule and how we think about that.

434
00:19:55,998 --> 00:19:59,319
Like anyone else who's thinking about schedules, we try and be aware of our dependencies, where

435
00:19:59,879 --> 00:20:03,820
and when and how we depend on other members of the studio to do work, but we also want

436
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,480
to make sure that our creative process is built in a way that flows in the same direction.

437
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,561
So our production reality and our ideal creative process aren't working against each other,

438
00:20:11,581 --> 00:20:12,842
which can so often be the case.

439
00:20:14,478 --> 00:20:16,781
This is actually something that I've talked about at GDC prior

440
00:20:17,062 --> 00:20:20,246
in 2014. Again, we'll make this talk available to everybody at

441
00:20:20,266 --> 00:20:23,311
the end. But all you really need to know about this for right now

442
00:20:23,751 --> 00:20:25,754
is that levels are built in a five pass system.

443
00:20:26,995 --> 00:20:33,756
And each one of those passes is tailor-made based on our expectations of dependencies on where the game is at a certain point in the project,

444
00:20:34,076 --> 00:20:38,317
as well as how we think we can be most effective in iterating the level creatively.

445
00:20:39,018 --> 00:20:42,779
And so in the context of this conversation, Pass 1 is where we're focused on layout,

446
00:20:42,999 --> 00:20:46,620
which means this is the first point at which our core kit elements need to be usable.

447
00:20:47,525 --> 00:20:51,029
But probably the more important subtlety to this is in the

448
00:20:51,189 --> 00:20:54,552
subsequent passes, we also need to make sure that the layout we

449
00:20:54,592 --> 00:20:57,976
did in pass one is reliable. That we're not having to go back

450
00:20:58,036 --> 00:21:00,959
to the drawing board and redo the first pass every time we do

451
00:21:00,979 --> 00:21:02,961
a subsequent pass because we're just going to hemorrhage time

452
00:21:03,001 --> 00:21:05,583
and fall behind if we get into that trap over and over again.

453
00:21:06,364 --> 00:21:10,387
And when you're in sync with the rest of your studio about your priorities in this kind of workflow,

454
00:21:10,747 --> 00:21:13,369
you're able to rough spaces out very, very early on.

455
00:21:13,909 --> 00:21:16,631
This is a screenshot from Concord Museum of Freedom, Fallout 4.

456
00:21:17,032 --> 00:21:21,495
And this comes, you know, this is in 2012, this is at a point where Nate and I have been working on the building kit,

457
00:21:21,535 --> 00:21:24,977
we're in agreement about the basic functionality, the pieces that we're going to represent,

458
00:21:25,077 --> 00:21:26,258
even though it's pretty rudimentary.

459
00:21:26,738 --> 00:21:30,941
And if you compare this to the shipping version of the space, you can see the similarity immediately.

460
00:21:31,422 --> 00:21:34,362
And that's because Nate and I were aligned in what mattered to us most.

461
00:21:34,782 --> 00:21:38,823
And probably, you know, the nicest thing about it is we were out of each other's hair.

462
00:21:39,223 --> 00:21:41,144
Like, once we knew how those pieces were going to work,

463
00:21:41,544 --> 00:21:45,044
I was able to do, you know, level design type of things and focus on all of those elements,

464
00:21:45,184 --> 00:21:48,145
and Nate could focus on the artistic side of things,

465
00:21:48,325 --> 00:21:51,406
and we didn't really have to conflict with each other in the later stages,

466
00:21:51,446 --> 00:21:54,767
and the years of time that passed between first and final.

467
00:21:57,061 --> 00:22:00,102
And so I find myself talking about priority a lot, like when

468
00:22:00,242 --> 00:22:02,683
thinking about this workflow and preparing this talk for today.

469
00:22:03,303 --> 00:22:05,784
And those priorities don't just apply to sort of the meta scale

470
00:22:05,804 --> 00:22:08,846
of workflow in our scheduling, but also to the individual

471
00:22:08,906 --> 00:22:12,207
elements of the kit. If we're very general about it, we can

472
00:22:12,387 --> 00:22:15,168
sort of lump all the elements of a kit into one of three

473
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:18,849
categories. You have your low use count hero pieces, your set

474
00:22:18,909 --> 00:22:21,090
piece objects, which only happen once in a while.

475
00:22:22,222 --> 00:22:24,963
you have utilitarian core pieces, your walls, floors,

476
00:22:25,003 --> 00:22:27,145
ceilings, stairwells, all the things you need to create a

477
00:22:27,185 --> 00:22:31,367
basic layout to establish flow and blocking. And then you have

478
00:22:31,387 --> 00:22:34,509
your variant pieces, cosmetic variants, alternates, pieces

479
00:22:34,549 --> 00:22:37,311
which are maybe part of the core kit but they're used less

480
00:22:37,351 --> 00:22:40,873
frequently or special requests to accommodate needs of layout.

481
00:22:42,174 --> 00:22:44,676
And again, we're cognizant of time, so we want to be

482
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:47,657
cognizant about when and how we build the kits and these

483
00:22:47,678 --> 00:22:48,738
different elements take priority.

484
00:22:49,888 --> 00:22:52,590
Going back to the 2013 talk again briefly, one of the

485
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:56,173
points we made then was that the hero piece is numerically

486
00:22:56,213 --> 00:22:59,455
the least important piece of art we're going to build. Now

487
00:22:59,475 --> 00:23:03,258
there's this thing about set piece art. If you're a producer,

488
00:23:03,718 --> 00:23:05,620
they're expensive to build. You kind of want to get them out of

489
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,882
the way early. If you're an artist, they're better looking.

490
00:23:08,982 --> 00:23:11,584
They're more interesting to work on. And if you're a level

491
00:23:11,624 --> 00:23:13,986
designer, they can sometimes feel like the thing which is

492
00:23:14,006 --> 00:23:15,767
going to make a moment work, which is going to make the

493
00:23:15,787 --> 00:23:18,530
level sing, which incidentally I think is kind of a yellow flag

494
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:19,330
in the strength of the level.

495
00:23:22,111 --> 00:23:25,833
The thing about this hero piece is that these all kind of combine and make them seductive.

496
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:29,614
They feel like the most important piece of art and sometimes get front loaded in the schedule.

497
00:23:30,074 --> 00:23:33,376
And we argue that you should do the opposite, that they are the least important thing.

498
00:23:33,856 --> 00:23:37,938
Your humble wall, your humble doorway, these things you're going to see dozens of times

499
00:23:37,998 --> 00:23:41,299
and they need to be rock solid and bulletproof and they need to be that early on.

500
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,661
You know, there's a stigma attached to words like generic, to words like repetitive.

501
00:23:46,421 --> 00:23:46,822
And I get it.

502
00:23:48,399 --> 00:23:49,839
But when we're talking about this kind of workflow, I think

503
00:23:49,859 --> 00:23:52,020
it's short-sighted to get hung up on this, to get fixated,

504
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:56,301
because it blinds us to the potential. Our generic pieces

505
00:23:56,401 --> 00:24:00,402
are by their nature versatile. Set pieces aren't. They're by

506
00:24:00,422 --> 00:24:02,883
their nature built to solve a specific problem with very

507
00:24:02,923 --> 00:24:06,684
little hope of being reused ever again. So the flexible pieces

508
00:24:06,704 --> 00:24:08,865
you have in the hands of the right level designer become

509
00:24:08,925 --> 00:24:12,446
problem solvers. They become the tool that you can use in many

510
00:24:12,506 --> 00:24:15,186
situations. They are the unsung heroes of level design.

511
00:24:17,177 --> 00:24:18,118
I've taken a scene like this.

512
00:24:19,378 --> 00:24:21,119
This is from the Saugus Ironworks,

513
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:25,401
and this is sort of the penultimate moment, the scene at the end of a quest

514
00:24:25,461 --> 00:24:26,261
and a dungeon space.

515
00:24:28,462 --> 00:24:29,463
Now the level designer here, Drew,

516
00:24:30,603 --> 00:24:32,825
would have loved to have a bunch of custom art to sell this moment.

517
00:24:32,845 --> 00:24:34,927
You know, he cares very much about how this shot is framed

518
00:24:34,947 --> 00:24:36,148
and how the player enters a space.

519
00:24:36,928 --> 00:24:38,249
But this is actually, you know,

520
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,031
a space where you're not seeing a bunch of custom art.

521
00:24:40,091 --> 00:24:43,393
This is a whole lot of generic art working together in concert

522
00:24:43,653 --> 00:24:45,635
with good composition, lighting, and staging

523
00:24:45,675 --> 00:24:48,417
to create a moment which has all the trappings of a set piece

524
00:24:48,817 --> 00:24:50,439
without actually being a set piece.

525
00:24:51,524 --> 00:24:55,889
And the important thing here isn't just that you can do this, but that it spares the time.

526
00:24:56,270 --> 00:25:00,094
The time that we didn't have to spend building custom art for this is time we could use somewhere

527
00:25:00,195 --> 00:25:03,819
else on something else that could have been more broadly applicable to the game as a whole.

528
00:25:06,044 --> 00:25:09,007
So I think you saw this coming, but I'm inverting the priority.

529
00:25:09,047 --> 00:25:11,830
I think the utilitarian core needs to happen early and fast.

530
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:13,332
The variants are important, too.

531
00:25:13,492 --> 00:25:15,334
And the hero kit is the least important thing.

532
00:25:15,394 --> 00:25:17,577
And we actually push those way to the end of the schedule.

533
00:25:18,378 --> 00:25:19,919
And this mentality is all about getting out

534
00:25:19,939 --> 00:25:21,421
of the way of progress, making sure

535
00:25:21,481 --> 00:25:23,543
that you're not blocking anybody else's ability

536
00:25:23,623 --> 00:25:24,825
to do meaningful work.

537
00:25:25,685 --> 00:25:30,208
And I think if you're the artist, it behooves you to minimize the roadblocks, to not be that bottleneck.

538
00:25:30,748 --> 00:25:35,751
For one, it's going to get you in a position of having real examples of how your art is being used as quickly as possible.

539
00:25:35,831 --> 00:25:39,733
And you're not relying on your own guesses and assumptions in the test space about how it's going to be used.

540
00:25:41,234 --> 00:25:44,295
It also allows you the most time to iterate on the visuals of the kit.

541
00:25:45,346 --> 00:25:48,230
In this particular point, I think some will find counterintuitive

542
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:52,435
because I think there's a tendency with some artists to want to figure everything out

543
00:25:52,815 --> 00:25:54,757
about how the art is going to look, how it's going to work,

544
00:25:54,777 --> 00:25:58,001
at every nut and bolt in place, before giving it away for somebody else to work with.

545
00:25:59,518 --> 00:26:02,020
But the problem here is that then you become the bottleneck.

546
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,001
You're holding up work.

547
00:26:03,502 --> 00:26:05,784
And that pressure to figure it out and get moving

548
00:26:05,884 --> 00:26:07,345
can force you into making decisions

549
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:09,167
you might rather have more time to think about.

550
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:11,590
But if you just focus on the proportions

551
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:13,411
and the functionality, which is all that level design

552
00:26:13,431 --> 00:26:14,572
really needs to move forward,

553
00:26:14,893 --> 00:26:17,435
you can then get out of the way, let them start working,

554
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:19,898
and have basically the duration of the project

555
00:26:19,938 --> 00:26:21,900
to focus on the cosmetic aspects of the kit.

556
00:26:23,568 --> 00:26:25,609
Now for level designers this can also be a shift in thinking

557
00:26:25,649 --> 00:26:27,569
because you're going to have to use place holders. You're not

558
00:26:27,589 --> 00:26:31,491
going to have your fancy hero piece early on. I actually

559
00:26:31,511 --> 00:26:33,532
don't think this is a big problem. It's actually useful

560
00:26:33,632 --> 00:26:37,373
exercise because level designers then are incumbent upon us to

561
00:26:37,493 --> 00:26:41,155
prove the actual need. Take for example the Boston public

562
00:26:41,215 --> 00:26:45,076
library. Like many of the spaces in downtown Boston, it's a

563
00:26:45,096 --> 00:26:47,597
beautiful building filled with beautiful things. You can spend

564
00:26:47,617 --> 00:26:50,839
an afternoon in this place filling a notebook with pieces

565
00:26:50,879 --> 00:26:53,140
of art that you believe you would need to make the space.

566
00:26:55,374 --> 00:26:57,355
But knowing the way we work, the level designer here, Darl,

567
00:26:57,395 --> 00:26:58,856
he didn't have that luxury.

568
00:26:58,936 --> 00:26:59,897
He needed to make progress.

569
00:26:59,917 --> 00:27:01,718
He needed to get started on his iterative passes.

570
00:27:02,838 --> 00:27:04,099
So he's using generic pieces.

571
00:27:04,479 --> 00:27:07,241
He's recreating the key rooms, the areas that we feel

572
00:27:07,281 --> 00:27:08,221
are important to the space.

573
00:27:08,722 --> 00:27:10,903
And while that's happening, a couple of other things

574
00:27:10,943 --> 00:27:11,403
are happening.

575
00:27:11,643 --> 00:27:12,744
The game is progressing.

576
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:15,425
The kits are getting more robust, their functionality,

577
00:27:15,446 --> 00:27:16,066
their visuals.

578
00:27:16,666 --> 00:27:18,407
Those placeholders are becoming a little bit more

579
00:27:18,487 --> 00:27:19,608
cemented into the layout.

580
00:27:19,628 --> 00:27:21,489
And we're finding the places where the placeholders work

581
00:27:21,509 --> 00:27:22,109
and where they don't.

582
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:26,251
We're also finding more about the gameplay of the space as Darrell iterates.

583
00:27:26,291 --> 00:27:30,593
We have guesses and assumptions, but until we can actually play, they're just guesses

584
00:27:30,633 --> 00:27:31,193
and assumptions.

585
00:27:31,673 --> 00:27:35,255
And what we realized by the time we were ready to do any custom art was that this space,

586
00:27:35,275 --> 00:27:38,076
this reading room, was the most important room in the library.

587
00:27:38,616 --> 00:27:41,937
What's more is we couldn't recreate this room with placeholders.

588
00:27:42,437 --> 00:27:46,159
The barrel vault ceiling that you see at the top and those big reading pane windows, there's

589
00:27:46,199 --> 00:27:47,539
nothing in the kit that could handle that.

590
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,001
And those are the custom pieces that we made for the Boston Public Library.

591
00:27:52,614 --> 00:27:55,896
The thing about this again is if Darrel had sat down and made

592
00:27:55,996 --> 00:27:58,658
a list of the custom set pieces he thought he wanted and

593
00:27:58,698 --> 00:28:01,440
prioritized them and we made them at the beginning, these

594
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,222
might not have been at the top of that list. We would have

595
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:06,603
possibly built art which wouldn't have been showcased

596
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:09,525
well, may not have even been necessary, and what's worse is

597
00:28:09,565 --> 00:28:12,567
we might actually have gotten the time to build these pieces

598
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:14,328
thinking they were less important than they really were.

599
00:28:18,587 --> 00:28:21,629
So visual variety is one of the big goals of the building kit.

600
00:28:22,049 --> 00:28:23,470
And one of the big ways we did that

601
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:24,931
is all the architectural variants.

602
00:28:25,852 --> 00:28:29,234
So with this setup, we could take any room in any dungeon

603
00:28:29,354 --> 00:28:30,235
and just swap it out.

604
00:28:30,295 --> 00:28:33,577
Like I can start at wallpaper, become the deco kit.

605
00:28:34,017 --> 00:28:35,418
It could be a concrete basement.

606
00:28:35,438 --> 00:28:36,579
I can make it into an attic.

607
00:28:37,207 --> 00:28:40,991
wood paneling, brick factory. This ends up being a ton of

608
00:28:41,031 --> 00:28:44,373
pieces. And just one of those architecture types is you can

609
00:28:44,394 --> 00:28:47,696
see it there. But because all the logic is the same across all

610
00:28:47,716 --> 00:28:50,459
these kits, I was able to bring new versions of this online in

611
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:52,761
as little as two weeks. You spend most of the time doing

612
00:28:52,801 --> 00:28:55,503
just destruction and little cosmetic things. You don't

613
00:28:55,523 --> 00:28:57,765
really have to worry about the logic. It's there. So that

614
00:28:58,085 --> 00:28:59,106
really makes it a lot easier.

615
00:28:59,996 --> 00:29:02,359
This lets us do a lot of things we could never do before like

616
00:29:02,419 --> 00:29:05,322
this where in the back there's brick walls, goes down to this

617
00:29:05,362 --> 00:29:08,325
concrete basement, there's these bare wood platforms suspended

618
00:29:08,345 --> 00:29:11,368
there and I can swap out any one of those elements because it's

619
00:29:11,388 --> 00:29:14,492
all broken apart. And we can do things like this because the

620
00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:16,834
walls, floors and ceilings are all separate. They can just open

621
00:29:16,874 --> 00:29:19,778
up into a larger space. That's not a custom transition. That's

622
00:29:19,798 --> 00:29:21,940
just what the level designer did for this particular area.

623
00:29:23,225 --> 00:29:25,527
or things like this where it's stacking vertically. There's

624
00:29:25,547 --> 00:29:27,788
the deco kit on the bottom. It goes to the wood panel kit

625
00:29:27,828 --> 00:29:30,930
above that. Previously when we did vertically stacking kits,

626
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:34,952
the logic just gets insane and it's all the naming conventions

627
00:29:34,992 --> 00:29:37,794
don't make any sense. People get confused and just don't do it.

628
00:29:38,314 --> 00:29:40,396
But now you can just put stuff on top of each other and it's

629
00:29:40,756 --> 00:29:43,798
easy. But you can still do really boring stuff like this.

630
00:29:44,638 --> 00:29:46,879
But even this one we couldn't do because it's actually wood panel

631
00:29:46,899 --> 00:29:49,581
walls in the back, but the floor is the deco kit. That would

632
00:29:49,601 --> 00:29:51,942
have been a whole new export before. Now I can just swap it

633
00:29:52,002 --> 00:29:52,082
out.

634
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:55,042
or you can just blow the whole floor out. The walls are just

635
00:29:55,082 --> 00:29:57,744
doing their own thing and these little damaged platforms can be

636
00:29:57,784 --> 00:30:01,187
moved around so every hole can look different. In this case it

637
00:30:01,227 --> 00:30:03,509
forms this ramp that you can walk up. The level designer is

638
00:30:03,549 --> 00:30:07,392
deciding what to do. That hole could even be 100 yards long. I

639
00:30:07,432 --> 00:30:10,855
didn't go on a max and make this 100 yard hole piece that would

640
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:13,718
get used once. But the level designer did this and it works

641
00:30:13,758 --> 00:30:14,258
out really well.

642
00:30:15,377 --> 00:30:17,417
and we can do things like this where the wall is angled at 45

643
00:30:17,957 --> 00:30:21,598
degrees or can go on these gentle curves. When we did this

644
00:30:21,658 --> 00:30:24,659
in Skyrim, there was a normal kit behind those walls and it

645
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:27,299
was all this wasted space you couldn't use. But now the walls

646
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:30,960
can just do this. Material swaps are something else that we did.

647
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,461
And this isn't an architecture change. It's just the textures.

648
00:30:35,121 --> 00:30:38,242
And these don't take very much time and it lets you get a lot

649
00:30:38,282 --> 00:30:40,822
of visual variety. So I can take that same wallpaper room

650
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:43,571
instead of changing the architecture, I can make it

651
00:30:43,831 --> 00:30:48,455
crazy 50s style wallpaper and this boring blue one. Another

652
00:30:48,735 --> 00:30:51,937
interesting pattern, old people wallpaper, just change the green

653
00:30:51,957 --> 00:30:54,979
stripe to a red stripe, intricate green, deep red,

654
00:30:55,399 --> 00:30:58,381
whatever. Most of those are made in two days. We can now go and

655
00:30:58,401 --> 00:31:00,943
take every single room in a space and make it feel unique.

656
00:31:01,444 --> 00:31:04,286
Because the walls, floors and ceilings are all separate, those

657
00:31:04,306 --> 00:31:07,968
can all be material swapped independently. Not every kit is

658
00:31:08,008 --> 00:31:08,729
the building kit, though.

659
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,730
And one of the first things we ask when we're building a kit

660
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:15,071
is what new functionality does it provide? Is it doing

661
00:31:15,111 --> 00:31:18,312
something new? Sometimes the answer is, well, no, let's just

662
00:31:18,332 --> 00:31:21,774
make another building kit. But that wasn't always the case. And

663
00:31:21,854 --> 00:31:24,614
one of those is the industrial kit. And we wanted these big

664
00:31:24,694 --> 00:31:28,076
blocky concrete things with these pipes rising up and a lot

665
00:31:28,116 --> 00:31:30,736
of intricate detail work. It's definitely not the building kit.

666
00:31:31,577 --> 00:31:32,697
And this ended up looking like this.

667
00:31:33,703 --> 00:31:36,686
So the way this works is there's these big blocks that form the

668
00:31:36,726 --> 00:31:40,109
core and just like mass out the shape of the building. But then

669
00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:42,731
there's this intricate framework kit that has frames of every

670
00:31:42,791 --> 00:31:45,654
size and every one of those sizes has variants that have X

671
00:31:45,714 --> 00:31:49,917
cross frames, V cross frames, A cross frames. There's a silo

672
00:31:49,957 --> 00:31:51,819
set up where there's a bunch of different widths and these are

673
00:31:51,859 --> 00:31:54,021
vertically stackable so we can make it as tall as we want.

674
00:31:54,942 --> 00:31:56,763
There's a bunch of different pipe kits. Some are big enough

675
00:31:56,784 --> 00:31:59,066
you can walk through. Others are just tiny details.

676
00:32:00,272 --> 00:32:02,373
Then there's this free room kit that we can put on top of those

677
00:32:02,413 --> 00:32:05,176
concrete blocks and you can go inside of these, take cover, we

678
00:32:05,196 --> 00:32:09,499
can put machines in there. Ends up looking like this. Everything

679
00:32:09,539 --> 00:32:11,881
going on here is because the level designer wanted it to be

680
00:32:11,921 --> 00:32:14,824
that way. I'm not dictating this as the artist. That catwalk is

681
00:32:14,844 --> 00:32:18,126
there for a reason. It will look different every time. Here you

682
00:32:18,146 --> 00:32:20,628
can take cover behind those pipes, that room is tucked away

683
00:32:20,648 --> 00:32:23,631
in the back. This space has a totally different feel with this

684
00:32:23,671 --> 00:32:25,673
spindly little pipe moving through it and all the frames

685
00:32:25,733 --> 00:32:26,794
and materials swap to red.

686
00:32:27,726 --> 00:32:29,847
Or we can just take parts of that kit and mix it with other

687
00:32:29,867 --> 00:32:32,529
kits. Here it's being used with a steam tunnel kit. There's a

688
00:32:32,569 --> 00:32:36,231
lot of versatility there. The utility kit is another kit that

689
00:32:36,251 --> 00:32:39,153
we built. And this was all about this intricate pipe work. And

690
00:32:39,233 --> 00:32:41,774
it snaps together in a certain way and there's a lot of baked

691
00:32:41,814 --> 00:32:44,896
in detail. And the hallway kit, the left side is different from

692
00:32:44,916 --> 00:32:47,037
the right side and these can move independently of one

693
00:32:47,077 --> 00:32:50,500
another. And we also have these long curving pieces to get away

694
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:53,361
from that rigid nature of the kit. And that ends up feeling

695
00:32:53,381 --> 00:32:53,701
like this.

696
00:32:55,699 --> 00:32:58,241
So using this kit, we can have a really simple hallway like this

697
00:32:58,341 --> 00:33:00,623
and we just throw a couple of trash piles on the ground and

698
00:33:00,663 --> 00:33:03,185
it's pretty much done. We don't need to do this big set dressing

699
00:33:03,225 --> 00:33:06,748
pass to make this look interesting. But that kit kind

700
00:33:06,788 --> 00:33:09,030
of wasn't worth the time. All we actually cared about was the

701
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:12,192
pipes. Cosmetically and architecturally, everything

702
00:33:12,232 --> 00:33:14,414
going on with the walls was pretty much the building kit.

703
00:33:15,195 --> 00:33:18,057
And in some cases, that's even what we did. Here it's utility

704
00:33:18,077 --> 00:33:20,479
kit on the right, building kit on the left and some of the

705
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:21,961
pipes you see are a separate pipe kit.

706
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:25,260
but it was a really nice kit to have. It's what we call a glue

707
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,381
kit because we're never going to build a space where it's all

708
00:33:27,481 --> 00:33:31,543
utility kit and just this giant building full of pipes. Instead

709
00:33:31,603 --> 00:33:33,424
we just use it to spice things up a little bit and it was

710
00:33:33,484 --> 00:33:36,586
really useful to have. The steam tunnel kit is another kit that

711
00:33:36,606 --> 00:33:39,447
we built. And this is a lot like the ratway kit from Skyrim

712
00:33:39,527 --> 00:33:41,588
where all these things are jammed together organically so

713
00:33:41,608 --> 00:33:43,989
we don't actually need that many pieces. But the main difference

714
00:33:44,109 --> 00:33:47,371
is that the floor is broken off and it's not baked in. So you

715
00:33:47,391 --> 00:33:50,252
can have a really narrow space like this or make it taller,

716
00:33:50,892 --> 00:33:51,453
make it taller.

717
00:33:52,601 --> 00:33:54,182
So the level designers can really play with the

718
00:33:54,222 --> 00:33:56,524
verticality. You can have these raised up areas on the side and

719
00:33:56,604 --> 00:33:59,547
drop down in the middle. The walls in the back can be angled

720
00:33:59,587 --> 00:34:01,769
however we want. You can blow a hole through with the cinder

721
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:04,631
blocks and then bring in the catwalks. Or I could just take

722
00:34:04,671 --> 00:34:06,433
those cinder blocks and put them up against the walls as a

723
00:34:06,493 --> 00:34:09,355
decorative element and bring in industrial framing on the walls

724
00:34:09,455 --> 00:34:11,497
and have a totally different feel. It's really flexible.

725
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:15,125
Another kit that was built by one of our artists, Claire

726
00:34:15,145 --> 00:34:16,806
Struthers, for downtown is the Deco Kit.

727
00:34:17,546 --> 00:34:19,387
And this was built with a lot of the principles of the other

728
00:34:19,407 --> 00:34:21,668
kits, where there's all these different parts, little trim

729
00:34:21,728 --> 00:34:24,188
kits, the lobby kit, the foundation so it can mix with

730
00:34:24,208 --> 00:34:24,589
the street.

731
00:34:25,529 --> 00:34:27,950
And one of the main things that this kit let us do is these

732
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:30,230
interior-exterior areas, where you could just move right

733
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:30,631
through it.

734
00:34:31,411 --> 00:34:32,971
Previously, this kind of thing would have been a load.

735
00:34:33,011 --> 00:34:35,932
You'd go up to a door, activate it, walk around for a little

736
00:34:35,972 --> 00:34:37,853
bit, activate it again, and load back out.

737
00:34:37,873 --> 00:34:39,333
Now you can just move right through it.

738
00:34:40,284 --> 00:34:44,133
And this kit was really flexible and let us build buildings of all sorts of shapes, which

739
00:34:44,213 --> 00:34:46,739
works really well with the organic nature of Boston streets.

740
00:34:51,002 --> 00:34:53,543
Yeah, and I do want to talk about Boston for a little bit,

741
00:34:53,623 --> 00:34:56,345
because for one, there's a tendency talking about this

742
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:59,146
kind of workflow in level design to focus on intimate spaces,

743
00:34:59,206 --> 00:35:01,127
interiors, combat arenas, these sorts of things.

744
00:35:02,007 --> 00:35:04,228
But exteriors can be built modular as well.

745
00:35:04,328 --> 00:35:08,170
And in fact, Boston downtown was the most ambitious thing

746
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:10,851
we've ever attempted on the level design scale at Bethesda.

747
00:35:11,732 --> 00:35:13,132
Huge and interlocking.

748
00:35:13,353 --> 00:35:16,234
And in order to start talking about and understanding how we

749
00:35:16,274 --> 00:35:19,275
approach Boston, we have to go all the way back to Washington

750
00:35:19,295 --> 00:35:20,136
D.C. in Fallout 3.

751
00:35:21,647 --> 00:35:23,809
Now, when it came to figuring out how to represent DC's

752
00:35:23,849 --> 00:35:26,290
downtown, for a number of reasons, we had decided to

753
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:27,251
block it off.

754
00:35:27,911 --> 00:35:29,592
So all the downtown neighborhoods were these

755
00:35:30,093 --> 00:35:32,474
little sort of cloistered areas, these walled gardens

756
00:35:32,874 --> 00:35:34,715
that you would load into, which were separate from the

757
00:35:34,795 --> 00:35:35,556
open world of the game.

758
00:35:36,997 --> 00:35:39,358
They all kind of had this consistent look and feel, where

759
00:35:39,378 --> 00:35:41,940
you can see the buildings and the big marble

760
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:42,781
piles on the edges.

761
00:35:42,801 --> 00:35:43,541
They were walls.

762
00:35:43,581 --> 00:35:44,462
They were literally walls.

763
00:35:45,002 --> 00:35:46,703
And that the meaningful gameplay happens in the

764
00:35:46,743 --> 00:35:48,964
negative space in the interior, in the ground level

765
00:35:48,984 --> 00:35:49,225
layout.

766
00:35:51,479 --> 00:35:54,064
Now this made getting around downtown really complicated.

767
00:35:54,084 --> 00:35:56,548
This is a map that users made to help them understand

768
00:35:56,588 --> 00:35:57,690
how to get from place to place.

769
00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:00,134
And I think the complexity of this map

770
00:36:00,214 --> 00:36:02,157
is indicative of some underlying issues

771
00:36:02,238 --> 00:36:03,920
with the implementation that we chose.

772
00:36:04,884 --> 00:36:08,246
So going into Fallout 4 and figuring out how we wanted to represent Boston,

773
00:36:08,686 --> 00:36:11,907
it was important to us that it was part of the open world and felt like

774
00:36:12,308 --> 00:36:13,568
the beating heart of the Commonwealth.

775
00:36:13,828 --> 00:36:16,469
We would have long sight lines and clear lines of view.

776
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:20,411
We'd have avenues and streets which were actually useful for navigating the city,

777
00:36:20,471 --> 00:36:21,912
as you would as a pedestrian.

778
00:36:22,312 --> 00:36:25,234
We wanted neighborhoods which tapered off naturally into the wilderness.

779
00:36:26,294 --> 00:36:28,975
And when we start thinking about how we're going to represent a space like this,

780
00:36:29,035 --> 00:36:31,436
we can get into conversations about how accurate must it be.

781
00:36:32,708 --> 00:36:34,929
Are we going to try and recreate the city street for street,

782
00:36:35,089 --> 00:36:36,370
building for building, brick for brick?

783
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:39,932
It's sort of the can I visit my college dorm mentality

784
00:36:40,193 --> 00:36:41,293
of city design.

785
00:36:42,692 --> 00:36:44,112
And we knew that was never our priority.

786
00:36:44,372 --> 00:36:46,273
We were always more focused on authenticity.

787
00:36:46,773 --> 00:36:49,154
Can we understand what makes Boston special

788
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:51,775
and distill it down into a core form

789
00:36:51,915 --> 00:36:54,076
and represent the fallout version of the city

790
00:36:54,596 --> 00:36:57,177
in a way that would feel familiar and sincere to Bostoners,

791
00:36:58,037 --> 00:37:00,338
but also like a real, real location

792
00:37:00,358 --> 00:37:02,679
with a real internal consistency and a sense of place

793
00:37:02,999 --> 00:37:05,280
to those who have no familiarity with the city whatsoever.

794
00:37:07,223 --> 00:37:11,545
So, with this mentality, we approach the actual process of building the city.

795
00:37:11,685 --> 00:37:13,246
And where we begin is with the coastline.

796
00:37:13,986 --> 00:37:17,708
One of the first things we create for any of our games is a rough pass of the world map.

797
00:37:18,708 --> 00:37:20,789
Now, Boston is defined by water.

798
00:37:21,269 --> 00:37:23,690
The Charles River, Boston Harbor, the Atlantic Ocean,

799
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:28,072
these give us hard boundaries, hard edges to most of the areas of the city we're going to recreate.

800
00:37:29,168 --> 00:37:32,611
We can take this and compare it against the scope and scale of the game map that we're going to build

801
00:37:32,911 --> 00:37:34,672
and now we know the square footage we're working with.

802
00:37:34,732 --> 00:37:38,955
Now we know how much we have to condense downtown.

803
00:37:40,356 --> 00:37:42,017
And then we can start focusing on the skyline.

804
00:37:42,778 --> 00:37:44,238
The skyline of Boston is important.

805
00:37:44,439 --> 00:37:48,541
It's not as iconic as the skyline of Shanghai or Paris or London,

806
00:37:48,581 --> 00:37:52,364
but it's a really useful skyline because it's asymmetrical

807
00:37:52,384 --> 00:37:54,205
and it provides an orienting element for players.

808
00:37:55,598 --> 00:38:02,013
And in order to recreate that orienting element, we have to focus on the anchor buildings that define the skyline and get their relative positioning correct.

809
00:38:02,874 --> 00:38:05,260
So this is another old screenshot of the game in the early stages.

810
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:13,564
Raf, one of our environment artists, he went through and used really temp buildings to rough out all of downtown.

811
00:38:14,204 --> 00:38:16,806
And what we were focused on here is roof heights and density.

812
00:38:17,326 --> 00:38:21,330
And specifically on those anchors. The cluster of skyscrapers in the financial district,

813
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:23,711
which is on the east end of the city and cuts off into the harbor.

814
00:38:24,232 --> 00:38:27,614
The sort of solitary, you know, nature of the Hancock Tower and Back Bay.

815
00:38:27,975 --> 00:38:31,958
And then Diamond City or Fenway Park kind of abutting at the west end of the city.

816
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:35,141
And we did end up sticking to this original past pretty

817
00:38:35,201 --> 00:38:36,803
faithfully all the way into the finished game.

818
00:38:37,263 --> 00:38:39,566
We were able to add a few more anchors, a few more landmarks

819
00:38:39,606 --> 00:38:41,308
for players to fixate on.

820
00:38:42,689 --> 00:38:44,752
And this is something that players familiar with Boston

821
00:38:44,772 --> 00:38:48,215
were able to pick up on from even our earliest trailer.

822
00:38:48,256 --> 00:38:50,078
People were able to take the background shot and make

823
00:38:50,158 --> 00:38:52,120
accurate guesses about some of the buildings we were

824
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,541
representing and the position of the camera.

825
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:57,191
So with the skyline ready to go, we start thinking about the

826
00:38:57,231 --> 00:38:59,433
thoroughfares, the streets, what is the skeleton, what are the

827
00:38:59,473 --> 00:39:02,254
bones of the city. And when you're representing any city

828
00:39:02,294 --> 00:39:04,716
space, you don't have to recreate the city street for

829
00:39:04,776 --> 00:39:07,077
street in order to get the feeling of navigating the city

830
00:39:07,117 --> 00:39:10,019
correct. If we're focused on creating, say, Manhattan, you're

831
00:39:10,039 --> 00:39:12,741
going to be thinking about long blocks, streets, avenues. It's a

832
00:39:12,801 --> 00:39:21,867
city planner's city. This is not Boston. Boston was created by

833
00:39:21,907 --> 00:39:23,908
filling in marshland and paving cow paths.

834
00:39:25,068 --> 00:39:27,530
a notoriously nasty city to drive in, but a really

835
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:30,712
wonderful pedestrian city. So that's how we experienced

836
00:39:30,752 --> 00:39:34,175
Boston. We went to Boston. We spent time on the streets, just

837
00:39:34,235 --> 00:39:37,117
moving around the city and just kind of experiencing it and

838
00:39:37,177 --> 00:39:38,998
existing there and getting a sense for

839
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:41,320
what are the streets we relied on for navigation?

840
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,701
What is our mental map of the city?

841
00:39:42,741 --> 00:39:44,042
What intersections matter to us?

842
00:39:44,122 --> 00:39:45,023
What points of interest?

843
00:39:45,103 --> 00:39:47,525
Where are they in relative positioning to each other?

844
00:39:48,105 --> 00:39:50,307
And then with this sort of sense of priority

845
00:39:50,347 --> 00:39:51,728
about what we're going to represent,

846
00:39:52,028 --> 00:39:54,610
we can then go back to our condensed version of Boston

847
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:57,152
and the world map and lay these streets out.

848
00:39:57,192 --> 00:39:58,994
And we actually did lay all of our major streets out.

849
00:39:59,034 --> 00:40:00,095
We knew what they were going to be named

850
00:40:00,115 --> 00:40:00,875
and how they correlated.

851
00:40:00,895 --> 00:40:01,996
And we stuck with these layouts

852
00:40:02,016 --> 00:40:03,758
with very little change all the way to ship.

853
00:40:04,928 --> 00:40:07,693
Once you have streets, you can start thinking more specifically about neighborhoods.

854
00:40:08,414 --> 00:40:12,281
Like any major urban center, Boston has distinct neighborhoods with their own culture, their

855
00:40:12,341 --> 00:40:15,687
own history, their own architectural quirks.

856
00:40:16,707 --> 00:40:18,568
And when we're starting to think about the neighborhoods

857
00:40:18,588 --> 00:40:20,430
that we're gonna represent and try and focus on,

858
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:21,951
we can start thinking about ownership.

859
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:24,394
As much as we can, we try to make sure

860
00:40:24,834 --> 00:40:27,656
we assign folks to areas that they're gonna own

861
00:40:27,676 --> 00:40:28,938
from concept to completion.

862
00:40:29,318 --> 00:40:30,979
And so each neighborhood was split off

863
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,702
as its own chunk of work that specific designer

864
00:40:33,742 --> 00:40:35,023
and artist would work together on,

865
00:40:35,343 --> 00:40:36,364
and they'd be responsible.

866
00:40:36,384 --> 00:40:38,927
The onus was on them to understand that neighborhood

867
00:40:38,987 --> 00:40:40,468
and how to bring it to life and how to do it,

868
00:40:40,828 --> 00:40:41,549
how to do right by it.

869
00:40:43,433 --> 00:40:45,814
So with all of this, we're ready to start creating,

870
00:40:45,834 --> 00:40:46,794
we're ready to start iterating.

871
00:40:46,995 --> 00:40:48,615
So this is all kind of pre-production,

872
00:40:48,635 --> 00:40:51,516
this is all ideology and getting ready to attack the city.

873
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:54,937
Now I mentioned it before, but we have a process for this.

874
00:40:55,957 --> 00:40:57,298
You know, I talked about it a previous year,

875
00:40:57,938 --> 00:41:00,439
and it's this iterative process that we go through

876
00:41:00,479 --> 00:41:01,279
when we build things out.

877
00:41:01,339 --> 00:41:02,679
It's worked really well for level design,

878
00:41:02,839 --> 00:41:05,460
and it only made sense to apply this to downtown.

879
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,440
You know, we have the neighborhoods,

880
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,081
we would treat these as super levels,

881
00:41:08,501 --> 00:41:10,262
and we would just give them more time and attention,

882
00:41:10,302 --> 00:41:11,902
but put them through the process that worked for us.

883
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:14,736
It didn't work.

884
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:19,870
It didn't take long to realize that building this view

885
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:20,950
was gonna be really hard.

886
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:22,051
We knew it was gonna be hard.

887
00:41:22,211 --> 00:41:24,493
We knew it wasn't something we had attempted before

888
00:41:24,553 --> 00:41:26,634
and there were gonna be wolves in the woods

889
00:41:26,694 --> 00:41:27,895
and unexpected problems.

890
00:41:28,555 --> 00:41:30,276
There were a lot of unexpected problems.

891
00:41:30,856 --> 00:41:32,497
It seemed at times like everything we knew

892
00:41:32,557 --> 00:41:34,418
about level design didn't apply.

893
00:41:34,939 --> 00:41:38,301
Our best practices in pacing, in setting up encounters,

894
00:41:38,341 --> 00:41:41,262
how our AI detection worked, how we optimized,

895
00:41:41,523 --> 00:41:43,644
how well does the editor run, how do we organize,

896
00:41:43,664 --> 00:41:46,125
how do we work together, nothing was going as planned.

897
00:41:46,446 --> 00:41:49,848
And all these hurdles were adding up and taking a lot of time from us.

898
00:41:50,728 --> 00:41:55,332
There was more revision, rethinking, and reworking creating Boston than with anything else.

899
00:41:55,372 --> 00:41:59,654
And it was taxing the schedule of metrics and best practices that we had in place.

900
00:42:00,795 --> 00:42:04,157
But while all of this is going on and all of this is going wrong,

901
00:42:04,578 --> 00:42:09,121
there's something else true, which is that we're building the city modular in a way that we also have never done before.

902
00:42:10,495 --> 00:42:13,460
Now, it's not like we've never built a city space modular before.

903
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:16,164
For example, in Skyrim, Whiterun is built with a kit.

904
00:42:16,965 --> 00:42:18,248
But it's built with the Whiterun kit.

905
00:42:18,288 --> 00:42:19,650
It's only used to build this city,

906
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:23,056
and the only person using the kit is the same artist building the pieces

907
00:42:23,156 --> 00:42:24,197
and using them to create the city.

908
00:42:26,185 --> 00:42:28,066
In Fallout 3, the level designers were using building

909
00:42:28,086 --> 00:42:30,827
kits to create those downtown neighborhoods, but those kits

910
00:42:30,847 --> 00:42:31,507
were pretty chunky.

911
00:42:32,328 --> 00:42:34,448
And that's just kind of where we were in terms of the state

912
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:35,989
of art for us as a studio at the time.

913
00:42:36,509 --> 00:42:38,730
But that was OK, because even though we didn't have a lot of

914
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:40,951
flexibility to create different shapes to accommodate

915
00:42:41,011 --> 00:42:41,711
our layout goals.

916
00:42:42,811 --> 00:42:44,631
Remember how I mentioned before that they were walled gardens?

917
00:42:44,991 --> 00:42:46,412
That made it really easy to adapt.

918
00:42:47,032 --> 00:42:49,612
If we had a downtown space in DC,

919
00:42:49,912 --> 00:42:51,793
and we wanted to try something else with it,

920
00:42:52,233 --> 00:42:53,873
we could just make the change to the layout

921
00:42:53,933 --> 00:42:56,073
and just move the walls of the garden to accommodate.

922
00:42:56,354 --> 00:42:57,274
It was really no big deal.

923
00:42:58,794 --> 00:43:00,594
But in Fallout 4, everything is connected.

924
00:43:00,654 --> 00:43:01,854
Everything's part of the open world.

925
00:43:02,275 --> 00:43:04,035
We cannot make a change to one neighborhood

926
00:43:04,355 --> 00:43:05,855
without affecting the neighborhood next to it,

927
00:43:06,155 --> 00:43:07,075
and potentially the one next to that,

928
00:43:07,115 --> 00:43:08,136
and creating a ripple effect

929
00:43:08,156 --> 00:43:09,676
that undermined work throughout the city.

930
00:43:12,045 --> 00:43:15,428
But like I mentioned, we were building the city far more modular than we ever had before.

931
00:43:15,828 --> 00:43:18,130
We were taking our lessons from interior kits over the years,

932
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:20,171
and applying them to how we built downtown.

933
00:43:20,451 --> 00:43:22,033
The pieces were far more granular,

934
00:43:22,453 --> 00:43:23,674
which gave us a couple of freedoms.

935
00:43:24,814 --> 00:43:27,415
One, when there was so much work to do,

936
00:43:27,555 --> 00:43:29,336
we had more people able to do the work.

937
00:43:29,936 --> 00:43:32,077
Level designers and artists both had a tremendous amount

938
00:43:32,117 --> 00:43:33,838
of power to react to issues.

939
00:43:34,198 --> 00:43:36,419
If we needed to change the shape of a building,

940
00:43:36,879 --> 00:43:37,659
we could do that.

941
00:43:37,759 --> 00:43:39,460
We could help an artist, an artist could help us,

942
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,681
and we could make changes without having to make

943
00:43:41,741 --> 00:43:43,501
big custom pieces and get turned around

944
00:43:43,521 --> 00:43:45,422
from the art schedule out of Max Lottie Dott.

945
00:43:46,263 --> 00:43:48,544
And also it let us respect things like the quirky street

946
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:49,485
layouts of Boston.

947
00:43:49,805 --> 00:43:52,286
We didn't have to conform streets to the buildings.

948
00:43:52,346 --> 00:43:54,247
We could conform the buildings to the streets.

949
00:43:54,747 --> 00:43:57,928
And this meant that when we had a problem that required us to

950
00:43:58,268 --> 00:43:59,989
make a change, we had the ability to do that.

951
00:44:00,069 --> 00:44:03,090
We weren't locked in to bad decisions we had inadvertently

952
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:06,152
made early on with pieces that were far too static to be

953
00:44:06,232 --> 00:44:07,232
flexible to iterate with.

954
00:44:08,654 --> 00:44:11,016
So while working module this way, you know, it had its own

955
00:44:11,056 --> 00:44:13,858
difficulties and problems, for the most part, it did decrease

956
00:44:13,898 --> 00:44:16,420
the pain and offset all the problems we were running with

957
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:19,223
Boston and let us maintain a focus on the quality of the

958
00:44:19,263 --> 00:44:22,486
city without having to make a bunch of compromises in how we

959
00:44:23,046 --> 00:44:25,408
approached it because of all the hurdles we ran into. Kind of

960
00:44:25,448 --> 00:44:26,029
saved our bacon.

961
00:44:29,992 --> 00:44:32,535
So now you're going to get the grab bag. This is the stuff

962
00:44:32,555 --> 00:44:34,937
that didn't quite fit into the other categories but that we

963
00:44:34,957 --> 00:44:35,477
wanted to cover.

964
00:44:36,419 --> 00:44:39,181
One of those is the plug and socket system. This is how we

965
00:44:39,221 --> 00:44:41,822
transition between kits. Previously when we transitioned

966
00:44:41,842 --> 00:44:45,564
from industrial to utility, that was a piece we made, that was

967
00:44:45,624 --> 00:44:47,605
it. If we needed to go to a different kit, we would make a

968
00:44:47,645 --> 00:44:51,667
new piece. Not very flexible. So the way we solved it this time

969
00:44:51,707 --> 00:44:54,208
is on the top we have these sockets and that's just a hole

970
00:44:54,268 --> 00:44:57,370
of a set size and then the plugs are door frames and other

971
00:44:57,410 --> 00:44:57,630
things.

972
00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:01,113
So as long as the holes match, we then put the plug in there

973
00:45:01,594 --> 00:45:04,637
and it works. I don't care what kit is on the other side. It's

974
00:45:04,677 --> 00:45:06,618
one of those things that was really, really obvious in

975
00:45:06,679 --> 00:45:08,761
retrospect, but we didn't actually do it that way before,

976
00:45:09,361 --> 00:45:13,005
so it worked out really well. And the way destruction works in

977
00:45:13,045 --> 00:45:15,787
kits is worth going into also. And there's a big problem with

978
00:45:15,827 --> 00:45:18,550
destruction in kits in that it's really repetitive. You just have

979
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:21,613
this piece or handful of pieces that get used over and over and

980
00:45:21,633 --> 00:45:22,674
it looks the same every time.

981
00:45:23,753 --> 00:45:26,114
So our solution was to have all these different little pieces

982
00:45:26,154 --> 00:45:28,335
that could get used together so then it can look different

983
00:45:28,355 --> 00:45:31,096
every time. So for the wall holes in the building kit,

984
00:45:31,197 --> 00:45:34,638
there's 11 versions of the hole. But that's only actually half

985
00:45:34,658 --> 00:45:37,859
the hole. The other side can be just a different variant or a

986
00:45:37,879 --> 00:45:40,800
different kit entirely. So if it looks too much like one next to

987
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:43,822
it, I can just start swapping it, swapping it, swapping it,

988
00:45:43,842 --> 00:45:46,683
just swap the one on the other side. So I can have this line

989
00:45:46,703 --> 00:45:48,864
of holes, swap them all.

990
00:45:49,792 --> 00:45:52,232
And again, the other one is being swapped independently, so

991
00:45:52,252 --> 00:45:54,733
there's a lot more potential versions there, and it's really

992
00:45:54,753 --> 00:45:57,573
flexible. This lets us do things like this, where I have this

993
00:45:57,653 --> 00:46:00,414
hallway, it's the concrete kit, material swapped to look like

994
00:46:00,474 --> 00:46:03,195
cinder blocks, and I can just Kool-Aid man through wherever I

995
00:46:03,235 --> 00:46:06,896
want. I can even go to a different kit. Here I'm going

996
00:46:06,916 --> 00:46:09,596
from building kit to utility kit, back to the building kit.

997
00:46:10,917 --> 00:46:12,857
The way floors work is a little bit different, though.

998
00:46:13,669 --> 00:46:16,270
and it's easier to just see it. And at the bottom you can have

999
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:18,451
these square pieces and they'll sock it in with the normal kit

1000
00:46:18,491 --> 00:46:21,133
logic. But then there's all these free floating platforms.

1001
00:46:21,513 --> 00:46:23,514
And these exist in all the versions of the building kit.

1002
00:46:24,035 --> 00:46:26,436
And this lets us do things like this. Where we have these

1003
00:46:26,476 --> 00:46:29,238
really organic hole shapes. And that's not a particular hole

1004
00:46:29,278 --> 00:46:32,500
piece. It's just whatever the level designer decided to do.

1005
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:35,261
And there's this ramp you can walk down. Or they can blow that

1006
00:46:35,301 --> 00:46:37,483
whole floor out. And then those platforms can be sagged

1007
00:46:37,543 --> 00:46:39,624
independently so there's a more organic feel to it.

1008
00:46:40,657 --> 00:46:42,838
And we can do things like this where the whole floor is just

1009
00:46:42,898 --> 00:46:47,339
caving in. And in this case we didn't build a church basement

1010
00:46:47,379 --> 00:46:49,940
kit. It's just the building kit on the bottom. And then we

1011
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:52,521
spend time making unique architecture on the top and

1012
00:46:52,541 --> 00:46:56,002
there's not a lot of wasted work. Dynamic destruction is a

1013
00:46:56,042 --> 00:46:58,443
little bit different, though. And this is for per piece

1014
00:46:58,483 --> 00:47:01,083
destruction where you can shoot out individual planks and it

1015
00:47:01,103 --> 00:47:03,544
works with kits and they'll simulate. So you can have

1016
00:47:03,584 --> 00:47:06,485
things like this where you have a shack and you start shooting

1017
00:47:06,545 --> 00:47:09,266
out individual planks or you take a grenade.

1018
00:47:09,955 --> 00:47:12,877
chuck it in there. Then a whole bunch of planks go flying out.

1019
00:47:14,138 --> 00:47:17,180
And again, this works with kits. So we use this for railings and

1020
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:21,023
other things like that. Decals and greebles are another thing

1021
00:47:21,043 --> 00:47:24,105
that are really obvious but extremely useful. So you can

1022
00:47:24,125 --> 00:47:27,047
have a really boring wall like this and just throw a bunch of

1023
00:47:27,547 --> 00:47:30,409
rust stains and cracks and greebles are like fans and vents

1024
00:47:30,449 --> 00:47:32,891
and things like that. And this isn't baked into the kit. These

1025
00:47:32,911 --> 00:47:34,892
are all just placed independently. So if I want to

1026
00:47:34,932 --> 00:47:37,674
take that fan and its rust stain, move it over a couple of

1027
00:47:37,714 --> 00:47:38,895
feet, you can just do that.

1028
00:47:39,752 --> 00:47:41,713
Now every wall can look different and there's a lot

1029
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:43,753
more opportunities for environmental storytelling.

1030
00:47:44,874 --> 00:47:46,975
Layers are another thing that are really obvious but save a

1031
00:47:47,035 --> 00:47:49,975
ton of time. Because sometimes you load into a scene and it

1032
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:54,137
looks like this. I don't even know what's going on. But you

1033
00:47:54,177 --> 00:47:56,778
set up layers and you start freezing things, hiding them,

1034
00:47:57,238 --> 00:47:59,839
extremely useful. That's not even the worst example. If you

1035
00:47:59,859 --> 00:48:03,120
go downtown, that list is just really long.

1036
00:48:04,155 --> 00:48:06,055
The mouse wheel swap is something else that we made.

1037
00:48:06,495 --> 00:48:08,216
And previously, if we wanted to swap out a piece,

1038
00:48:08,356 --> 00:48:10,436
you would click on a piece, bring up a menu,

1039
00:48:10,916 --> 00:48:12,897
and then pick which one you want, hit OK.

1040
00:48:13,037 --> 00:48:14,077
Maybe that's the piece you want.

1041
00:48:14,217 --> 00:48:14,837
Maybe it's not.

1042
00:48:15,337 --> 00:48:16,058
Really, really slow.

1043
00:48:16,878 --> 00:48:18,718
But this looks like this, because you can just

1044
00:48:18,758 --> 00:48:19,678
click and scroll the mouse wheel.

1045
00:48:19,698 --> 00:48:20,839
It's great for finding variance.

1046
00:48:20,899 --> 00:48:22,799
And like that wall hole example I showed earlier,

1047
00:48:23,239 --> 00:48:24,580
I can just do that in a matter of seconds.

1048
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:25,960
You can go through a whole dungeon

1049
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:26,880
in just a couple minutes.

1050
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:28,240
Big time saver.

1051
00:48:28,801 --> 00:48:30,301
And this also works with material swaps.

1052
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:35,602
helper markers are something we talked about in 2013. But we

1053
00:48:35,622 --> 00:48:37,743
were being kind of sneaky at the time because we had real kits

1054
00:48:37,763 --> 00:48:39,904
that were using it but we couldn't show it so I had to

1055
00:48:39,944 --> 00:48:43,605
make a fake kit to show. So this is how it looks in practice.

1056
00:48:44,365 --> 00:48:46,505
And there's all these editor only markers to show things like

1057
00:48:46,525 --> 00:48:49,746
where the doors are, how the walls line up and it snaps

1058
00:48:49,786 --> 00:48:51,987
together. Markers for the ceiling so I don't have to flip

1059
00:48:52,007 --> 00:48:54,588
my camera upside down just to click on it. They're really

1060
00:48:54,648 --> 00:48:54,848
useful.

1061
00:48:56,282 --> 00:48:58,482
but the modular workflow is useful for more than just

1062
00:48:58,562 --> 00:49:00,823
architecture. You can also use it for props and things like

1063
00:49:00,863 --> 00:49:03,524
that. And one of those things that we built is the machine

1064
00:49:03,564 --> 00:49:06,905
kit. And there's this large library of parts, and fins and

1065
00:49:06,945 --> 00:49:10,126
tanks and pipes. And an LD can just block out an area and say,

1066
00:49:10,146 --> 00:49:13,527
I want a machine here. And then an artist can come and do that.

1067
00:49:13,947 --> 00:49:16,468
One of our concept artists, John Gravato, he was really heavily

1068
00:49:16,488 --> 00:49:19,029
involved in doing this. And this was a great use of his time

1069
00:49:19,049 --> 00:49:21,210
because it was really towards the end of the project. Don't

1070
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:22,650
exactly need a lot of concept art then.

1071
00:49:23,507 --> 00:49:25,449
And this ended up looking like this. There's all these

1072
00:49:25,489 --> 00:49:28,072
component parts and those are the potential material swaps on

1073
00:49:28,092 --> 00:49:32,876
the top. And we can build things like this. Which are composed of

1074
00:49:32,896 --> 00:49:35,739
all these tiny little parts. So you can make all kinds of

1075
00:49:35,779 --> 00:49:41,004
different things. Even vehicles and arcade cabinets. It's really

1076
00:49:41,024 --> 00:49:44,167
versatile. And you can also use it with other existing art like

1077
00:49:44,208 --> 00:49:44,588
this truck.

1078
00:49:45,485 --> 00:49:48,106
And in a normal workflow, each one of those things could have

1079
00:49:48,126 --> 00:49:49,027
been a custom asset.

1080
00:49:49,107 --> 00:49:51,768
Someone goes into ZBrush for two weeks, you get a custom

1081
00:49:51,808 --> 00:49:52,789
texture, looks great.

1082
00:49:52,849 --> 00:49:53,389
That's awesome.

1083
00:49:54,249 --> 00:49:55,230
But that takes a long time.

1084
00:49:55,710 --> 00:49:58,852
And using this setup, John was able to make 400 machines.

1085
00:49:59,192 --> 00:50:00,733
We wouldn't have been able to do that otherwise.

1086
00:50:01,473 --> 00:50:03,554
So think about how you can use the modular workflow for more

1087
00:50:03,574 --> 00:50:04,174
than just kits.

1088
00:50:07,296 --> 00:50:09,397
OK, so I'm going to wind us around into the home stretch.

1089
00:50:10,854 --> 00:50:13,397
there's a lot of ground to cover in the talk today. And we kind

1090
00:50:13,417 --> 00:50:15,839
of squeezed in everything that we thought we'd really have time

1091
00:50:15,899 --> 00:50:19,302
for. But the talk has bounced around a lot just because we

1092
00:50:19,322 --> 00:50:22,746
wanted to fit it all in. And honestly, Nate, myself, many of

1093
00:50:22,786 --> 00:50:25,068
our colleagues at Bethesda, we could sit and talk to you for

1094
00:50:25,468 --> 00:50:28,751
another hour or two or the rest of the day about the ups and the

1095
00:50:28,791 --> 00:50:30,293
downs and nuances of this work flow.

1096
00:50:31,214 --> 00:50:33,136
And it is a workflow that has ups and downs.

1097
00:50:33,376 --> 00:50:34,857
It's not a shortcut.

1098
00:50:34,917 --> 00:50:37,480
It's not a solution for all scenarios.

1099
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,823
And with this and any other method or approach,

1100
00:50:40,883 --> 00:50:43,545
whether it's level design or production

1101
00:50:43,686 --> 00:50:46,929
or best coding practices, it's more important

1102
00:50:47,069 --> 00:50:49,751
that you understand the, more important

1103
00:50:49,771 --> 00:50:50,752
than understanding the workflow,

1104
00:50:50,952 --> 00:50:53,455
that you understand the priorities that you have as a team.

1105
00:50:54,095 --> 00:50:55,536
and the part is that your game has.

1106
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:57,676
Because any method like this,

1107
00:50:58,177 --> 00:50:59,837
you should understand before adopting

1108
00:50:59,977 --> 00:51:01,518
because it's never one size fits all.

1109
00:51:02,418 --> 00:51:03,978
And I strongly believe that when it comes

1110
00:51:04,018 --> 00:51:05,219
to process and technique,

1111
00:51:05,379 --> 00:51:06,939
you know, it's the goals of the game,

1112
00:51:07,299 --> 00:51:08,700
the ambitions that you have as a team

1113
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,801
that should define the process by which it is made,

1114
00:51:11,421 --> 00:51:12,401
and never the other way around.

1115
00:51:13,341 --> 00:51:13,802
Thanks very much.

1116
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:29,187
We must have been nervous because we have some time. If

1117
00:51:29,247 --> 00:51:31,650
anybody has questions, we have microphones set up here. You can

1118
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:38,358
queue up and we'll take a few. You in the middle? I was

1119
00:51:38,398 --> 00:51:41,482
wondering at what point in the design process do you factor in

1120
00:51:41,522 --> 00:51:45,366
play tester feedback regarding design of levels or aesthetics?

1121
00:51:47,623 --> 00:51:49,605
So we have those various iterative stages,

1122
00:51:49,845 --> 00:51:52,447
and all those stages can be independently verified.

1123
00:51:53,248 --> 00:51:55,870
So what we'll do is we have a few different processes.

1124
00:51:55,990 --> 00:51:57,291
We will do peer review.

1125
00:51:57,651 --> 00:52:00,894
So people will look at them together and offer feedback.

1126
00:52:01,775 --> 00:52:02,856
We will do it within the team.

1127
00:52:03,196 --> 00:52:04,818
We can do it with our QA department.

1128
00:52:05,498 --> 00:52:07,640
We'll occasionally do sort of big batches of review,

1129
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:09,281
like we call it Level Designer Summer Camp.

1130
00:52:09,762 --> 00:52:14,044
where we all get together and we all look at every space in the game and come up with a bunch of feedback

1131
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:17,446
and we structure the feedback based around each of the iterative passes

1132
00:52:17,886 --> 00:52:19,968
so that we kind of know what we're looking for and how we can improve.

1133
00:52:19,988 --> 00:52:22,629
Cool, thanks.

1134
00:52:22,729 --> 00:52:23,330
Over here on the right.

1135
00:52:24,190 --> 00:52:25,391
Hello.

1136
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:30,114
My question is, what was the thought process behind choosing which pieces to give to the player

1137
00:52:30,194 --> 00:52:31,674
from the kit that you already had?

1138
00:52:32,235 --> 00:52:33,576
You mean in terms of the workshop system?

1139
00:52:33,776 --> 00:52:33,976
Yeah.

1140
00:52:36,215 --> 00:52:40,118
Workshop was kind of a different system, so it was just whatever

1141
00:52:40,178 --> 00:52:42,199
we thought would be a useful piece for them to have without

1142
00:52:42,239 --> 00:52:43,520
it being too overwhelming.

1143
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:45,721
Like, we didn't want those kits to be like the building kit

1144
00:52:45,741 --> 00:52:47,022
where there's 500 pieces.

1145
00:52:47,422 --> 00:52:48,843
So we tried to pare it down a bit more.

1146
00:52:49,504 --> 00:52:52,225
Yeah, the functionality of the Workshop kits is slightly

1147
00:52:52,305 --> 00:52:53,646
different from the ones that we used.

1148
00:52:54,647 --> 00:52:57,509
But I think it's fair to say that over time, we started to,

1149
00:52:57,609 --> 00:53:00,911
like, the differences between Workshop kits and our regular

1150
00:53:00,931 --> 00:53:04,233
kits, it actually got more similar over time than they did

1151
00:53:04,253 --> 00:53:04,753
get different.

1152
00:53:05,013 --> 00:53:05,193
Yeah.

1153
00:53:07,062 --> 00:53:07,302
Thanks.

1154
00:53:08,263 --> 00:53:08,403
Thanks.

1155
00:53:08,463 --> 00:53:08,983
Question over here.

1156
00:53:09,643 --> 00:53:09,943
Yes.

1157
00:53:10,763 --> 00:53:13,384
Now, you mentioned that your process changed

1158
00:53:13,464 --> 00:53:15,204
between Skyrim and Fallout 4.

1159
00:53:15,564 --> 00:53:19,765
Now, given the increased granularity and difficulty

1160
00:53:19,805 --> 00:53:23,506
regarding recreating Boston in Fallout 4,

1161
00:53:23,866 --> 00:53:28,407
how has the collaboration between artists and level

1162
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:30,788
designers evolved if it did?

1163
00:53:32,821 --> 00:53:35,002
Well, one of the big things that we have is there's an art review

1164
00:53:35,062 --> 00:53:37,864
process. Since the pieces are so granular, you can pretty much do

1165
00:53:37,904 --> 00:53:41,186
whatever you want with them. So we make sure to check everything

1166
00:53:41,266 --> 00:53:44,148
and give some notes, which they may or may not agree with, but

1167
00:53:44,648 --> 00:53:47,089
it's a bit of a back and forth and it's gotten more official, I

1168
00:53:47,109 --> 00:53:47,950
guess, as it's gone on.

1169
00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:50,751
Yeah, the main thing is that we have slightly different

1170
00:53:50,771 --> 00:53:54,392
sensibilities in terms of what, you know, how important is it

1171
00:53:54,412 --> 00:53:56,272
that something looks good and how important is it that

1172
00:53:56,292 --> 00:53:59,693
something works good. And so by making sure that we're kind of

1173
00:54:00,273 --> 00:54:02,414
both involved in creating the kit but then both involved in

1174
00:54:02,434 --> 00:54:05,175
kind of vetting and signing off on the spaces that we create

1175
00:54:05,355 --> 00:54:07,515
with them, we can kind of establish parity and sort of

1176
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:08,656
keep the peace between the departments.

1177
00:54:09,476 --> 00:54:10,436
All right. Thank you very much.

1178
00:54:10,736 --> 00:54:11,916
Thank you. In the middle again.

1179
00:54:12,397 --> 00:54:14,597
Hey guys. First thing, great talk.

1180
00:54:15,370 --> 00:54:19,255
And then secondly, my question has to do with performance and metrics.

1181
00:54:20,236 --> 00:54:24,841
How did that going more modular affect those aspects of the game?

1182
00:54:25,042 --> 00:54:25,642
It screwed it up.

1183
00:54:27,945 --> 00:54:30,949
Our rendering programmers were not happy with us when we made this decision.

1184
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:32,411
Did they hard cap you?

1185
00:54:33,247 --> 00:54:35,949
No, one of the main ways we solved that is we ended up

1186
00:54:35,969 --> 00:54:38,311
putting in an object combination system. So even though it was

1187
00:54:38,331 --> 00:54:40,553
broken apart into all these different pieces, it would get

1188
00:54:40,714 --> 00:54:44,297
chunked in and then visibility after the fact. So it didn't

1189
00:54:44,317 --> 00:54:47,380
really matter in the end, just when we were building it and

1190
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:48,221
running it in the editor.

1191
00:54:49,201 --> 00:54:51,804
Yeah, but there was a lot of tech that had to be kind of

1192
00:54:51,844 --> 00:54:53,846
reconsidered to make this workflow possible.

1193
00:54:57,316 --> 00:55:00,122
Yeah, I sort of have the same question, I guess a little more depth.

1194
00:55:00,583 --> 00:55:00,843
Okay.

1195
00:55:00,903 --> 00:55:06,535
Yeah, how do you, does basically just everything get sort of baked together at the final game?

1196
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:11,742
there is a baking process. So static collections are one way

1197
00:55:11,782 --> 00:55:14,804
that we can control essentially baking. We can select a group of

1198
00:55:14,884 --> 00:55:17,606
objects and say, yep, this is a static collection now. And those

1199
00:55:17,626 --> 00:55:20,908
get handled a little differently in terms of how they render and

1200
00:55:20,928 --> 00:55:24,991
how they occlude. We also have a baking process which

1201
00:55:25,091 --> 00:55:29,435
precalculates visibility from various directions in the kit

1202
00:55:29,455 --> 00:55:32,537
and then we use that visibility to compute quicker on the fly at

1203
00:55:32,557 --> 00:55:32,857
run time.

1204
00:55:33,395 --> 00:55:37,838
I guess also, do this do any instancing? How much can get

1205
00:55:37,958 --> 00:55:42,440
baked? If you have a level, you know, the church scene, you have

1206
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:45,301
a lot of duplicated parts, but then the upper level seems to be

1207
00:55:45,341 --> 00:55:49,604
pretty sculpted, I guess. We're not actually instancing. It's

1208
00:55:49,724 --> 00:55:53,686
baked out as a large chunk. And the only things that are not

1209
00:55:53,726 --> 00:55:56,347
baked out are dynamic objects like a tin can or something like

1210
00:55:56,367 --> 00:55:59,168
that wouldn't get combined. Okay. Thank you.

1211
00:56:00,805 --> 00:56:06,007
So you mentioned you had a review process for how, when you have conflicts between,

1212
00:56:06,027 --> 00:56:14,031
I know we do environment art modularly as well, and we had a lot of fights, like unit abuse,

1213
00:56:14,411 --> 00:56:17,932
or like, are you using this correctly, you're not using the unit you're supposed to,

1214
00:56:17,952 --> 00:56:21,614
do you solve that by like a creative director stepping in,

1215
00:56:21,674 --> 00:56:24,315
saying what is more important, or how do you do that usually?

1216
00:56:25,490 --> 00:56:28,851
I mean, we kind of have ground rules. We generally, and some

1217
00:56:28,871 --> 00:56:31,812
of this just comes with working together for over a decade.

1218
00:56:32,312 --> 00:56:34,533
Generally speaking, when we fight, we already know who's

1219
00:56:34,553 --> 00:56:38,654
going to win. Based on the context. At the end of the day,

1220
00:56:43,944 --> 00:56:49,147
one side does have to win. And it's kind of case by case. It's

1221
00:56:49,187 --> 00:56:50,968
not too often. I guess it happens once in a while where a

1222
00:56:51,008 --> 00:56:54,530
third party has to step in and decide. Not often though. I

1223
00:56:54,570 --> 00:56:58,152
think the main thing is art has to be kind of okay that things

1224
00:56:58,332 --> 00:57:03,035
will happen. I think that's the slowest part of adoption in the

1225
00:57:03,075 --> 00:57:03,535
process.

1226
00:57:05,405 --> 00:57:09,428
level designers are going to be artists. With this you're going to make decisions. And the

1227
00:57:09,448 --> 00:57:16,353
important thing is that there's a two-way street. One of our environment artists is a

1228
00:57:16,413 --> 00:57:20,015
practicing architect and came back in the game development. And some of the stuff I do drives

1229
00:57:20,055 --> 00:57:20,816
him up the wall.

1230
00:57:22,098 --> 00:57:25,920
he'll tell me why and at the end of the day, I hear what you're

1231
00:57:25,941 --> 00:57:29,323
saying, but we can't accommodate or he'll end up inputting

1232
00:57:29,363 --> 00:57:32,385
something better than the process. So I guess don't be

1233
00:57:32,405 --> 00:57:37,108
jerks, right? Just talk. And realize you're going to win

1234
00:57:37,128 --> 00:57:38,909
something, you're going to lose something. The game is what

1235
00:57:38,929 --> 00:57:43,913
matters, not individual egos. Did those reviews help in

1236
00:57:44,413 --> 00:57:48,215
mitigating bigger fights down the line? If you check in once

1237
00:57:48,255 --> 00:57:49,696
in a while, does that help rather than?

1238
00:57:50,438 --> 00:57:54,360
that's something new. I think it helped a lot. One of the other

1239
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:56,761
things that came from the reviews is the level designer

1240
00:57:56,801 --> 00:57:58,962
sort of got how things would work and it would get better and

1241
00:57:58,982 --> 00:58:01,584
better over time. So then the notes would just get shorter and

1242
00:58:01,624 --> 00:58:01,904
shorter.

1243
00:58:03,237 --> 00:58:05,800
Yeah, and for instance, like with the review process that Nate's mentioning,

1244
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:09,284
like really that was Nate, like for the most, maybe entirely, right?

1245
00:58:09,684 --> 00:58:12,067
Going through and looking at all the spaces, providing notes, but like

1246
00:58:12,568 --> 00:58:14,950
the level designer and Nate, like both knew that

1247
00:58:15,171 --> 00:58:17,814
the level designer had the prerogative to ignore everything, right?

1248
00:58:18,294 --> 00:58:20,737
Usually they didn't because there was good feedback, but...

1249
00:58:21,357 --> 00:58:25,459
Nate had a good barometer for what was misused that he didn't

1250
00:58:25,499 --> 00:58:26,679
like versus what was a bug.

1251
00:58:26,839 --> 00:58:29,280
And a bug is as a bug.

1252
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:31,121
This is going to cause a problem because you

1253
00:58:31,161 --> 00:58:32,381
have used it incorrectly.

1254
00:58:32,701 --> 00:58:34,142
Versus, I don't like what you're doing,

1255
00:58:34,602 --> 00:58:35,942
and here's a suggestion for how to do it better.

1256
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:37,583
Thanks a lot.

1257
00:58:38,703 --> 00:58:38,923
Over here.

1258
00:58:40,844 --> 00:58:41,484
Yeah, great talk.

1259
00:58:42,105 --> 00:58:45,466
So usually when you're building a large game,

1260
00:58:46,454 --> 00:58:49,855
You have to use kits from certain regions and areas so you

1261
00:58:49,875 --> 00:58:54,278
don't mix and match tons of different texture maps and

1262
00:58:54,298 --> 00:58:58,000
everything. You seem to be mixing a lot of them. Was

1263
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:03,003
everything baked in at the end? Or was that some of the

1264
00:59:03,043 --> 00:59:05,364
optimization issues that you guys ran into?

1265
00:59:06,464 --> 00:59:08,586
Without extending the question too much, what do you mean by

1266
00:59:08,686 --> 00:59:10,166
everything? Everything is baked in.

1267
00:59:11,507 --> 00:59:12,608
Say texture maps.

1268
00:59:13,788 --> 00:59:18,853
For instance, an example, in something like Lord of the Rings Online, you had an orc kit,

1269
00:59:19,474 --> 00:59:24,919
and you could mix that with maybe another race, but you can't mix six kits together

1270
00:59:24,959 --> 00:59:27,982
because you're going to pull in a whole bunch of different kind of texture pages.

1271
00:59:28,242 --> 00:59:31,526
So you're making more of a technical point than like a world-building and fiction point.

1272
00:59:31,606 --> 00:59:32,306
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1273
00:59:32,326 --> 00:59:33,007
Technical point, yeah.

1274
00:59:34,328 --> 00:59:39,812
you're only pulling in the parts you're actually using since it's

1275
00:59:39,832 --> 00:59:42,675
all broken apart. So like in that steam tunnel, I bring in

1276
00:59:42,715 --> 00:59:46,017
the industrial catwalks and that's it. It's only that one

1277
00:59:46,057 --> 00:59:51,802
texture. So that helped. But it's still a lot. But we have

1278
00:59:51,822 --> 00:59:56,725
spaces that have like seven, eight kits in it. Was that a two

1279
00:59:56,765 --> 01:00:00,828
more questions or no more? Two minutes. All right. Right here.

1280
01:00:03,502 --> 01:00:06,763
When building the game, so much of the game as a placeholder initially, do you run into

1281
01:00:07,543 --> 01:00:12,705
difficulty with people understanding the final vision or people feeling that like working in a vacuum or

1282
01:00:12,725 --> 01:00:19,148
does concept art and previs play a huge role in that or do you guys work so much in this system that it's not an issue?

1283
01:00:19,715 --> 01:00:22,155
Well, I think one of the main things is that we don't gray box

1284
01:00:22,195 --> 01:00:25,436
gray box. We try to take those kits and put in the details

1285
01:00:25,456 --> 01:00:27,717
that matter so you can really get a feel for what it's going

1286
01:00:27,737 --> 01:00:30,538
to be even if it's kind of crappy and not done. And that's

1287
01:00:30,578 --> 01:00:33,239
made a big difference. Because when we tried to just make a

1288
01:00:33,279 --> 01:00:36,400
gray box kit that's just blank walls, ends up not actually

1289
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:40,161
solving problems and it ends up being a problem down the line.

1290
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:47,662
Hey guys, once again thank you for the talk. I found it to be really informative.

1291
01:00:47,883 --> 01:00:52,847
And I just have a brief question about the modularity and prefab sort of system that you guys were using.

1292
01:00:53,307 --> 01:00:59,312
You mentioned it briefly but it's something I haven't experienced in my previous Bethesda editors that I've experimented with.

1293
01:00:59,372 --> 01:01:04,236
So you mentioned that you can tie all the pieces together and then arrange them in chunks.

1294
01:01:04,356 --> 01:01:10,481
I just wasn't sure how you would coordinate with all the LDs and artists, how to make sure every prefab meshes with every other one.

1295
01:01:11,367 --> 01:01:14,347
like I said, we have a convention that we're used to

1296
01:01:14,387 --> 01:01:18,608
from prior games. When the fallout 4 creation kit drops

1297
01:01:18,728 --> 01:01:21,369
out, you'll be able to load that up and you'll see, if you're

1298
01:01:21,389 --> 01:01:24,109
familiar with our modding, recognizable naming conventions,

1299
01:01:24,169 --> 01:01:27,490
recognizable piece shapes. And so we'll have those static

1300
01:01:27,510 --> 01:01:30,531
collections bundled up in one part and in a separate folder

1301
01:01:30,591 --> 01:01:33,371
usually and then subcomponent pieces. And it's just like we

1302
01:01:33,411 --> 01:01:35,672
have this sort of institutional knowledge of the way we expect

1303
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:37,232
kits to be arranged and we just mimicked it.

1304
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,203
questions, feel free to come up. We have to tear down here

1305
01:01:41,243 --> 01:01:42,004
for the next. Thank you all.
