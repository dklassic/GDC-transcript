00:00:07,062 --> 00:00:10,745
Hi, my name is Jongwoo Kim. I'm from Kitfox Games,

2
00:00:10,745 --> 00:00:13,047
and I'm here to talk about Cruel Fate,

3
00:00:13,047 --> 00:00:15,429
Emergent Tragedies in the Shrouded Isle.

4
00:00:15,429 --> 00:00:18,252
Just a quick note about our studio.

5
00:00:18,252 --> 00:00:19,413
We're based out of Montreal,

6
00:00:19,413 --> 00:00:22,115
and previously we released Moonhunters,

7
00:00:22,115 --> 00:00:26,319
which is a co-op action RPG with procedurally generated world

8
00:00:26,319 --> 00:00:29,001
and trait-based role-playing mechanics.

9
00:00:29,001 --> 00:00:31,723
Last year, we had a highly successful Kickstarter campaign

10
00:00:31,723 --> 00:00:33,705
for Boyfriend Dungeon, which is a dungeon crawler

11
00:00:33,705 --> 00:00:34,866
crossed with dating sim.

12
00:00:35,945 --> 00:00:39,667
But today we're going to talk about something very different.

13
00:00:39,667 --> 00:00:42,029
Has anyone played The Shroud at all?

14
00:00:42,029 --> 00:00:42,569
Some of you.

15
00:00:42,569 --> 00:00:46,032
OK, I'm going to play the trailer anyway,

16
00:00:46,032 --> 00:00:46,692
because I get to do that.

17
00:00:46,692 --> 00:00:46,892
Let's see.

18
00:00:46,892 --> 00:00:47,293
Here we go.

19
00:00:47,293 --> 00:00:50,875
["SHROUD THEME"]

20
00:01:54,832 --> 00:01:57,394
Oh, that was not intentional.

21
00:01:57,394 --> 00:02:01,297
Oh, too much power tripping.

22
00:02:01,297 --> 00:02:06,220
Sorry.

23
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,881
I'm just gonna drag back my notes here.

24
00:02:25,673 --> 00:02:27,814
All right, so as you saw in the trailer,

25
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,195
the Shrouded Isle is a human sacrifice cult simulator.

26
00:02:30,195 --> 00:02:35,338
You play as the high priest of this small island village

27
00:02:35,338 --> 00:02:37,239
that worships a slumbering dark god.

28
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:40,060
And in preparation for his awakening,

29
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,501
you try to maintain the faith of your people,

30
00:02:42,501 --> 00:02:45,522
maintain the loyalty of the five great houses

31
00:02:45,522 --> 00:02:49,044
of the village, and make a human sacrifice

32
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:50,285
at the end of each season.

33
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:56,492
The project began as an entry for a game jam back in 2015.

34
00:02:56,492 --> 00:02:58,253
We really loved the concept,

35
00:02:58,253 --> 00:03:00,874
so we decided to fully develop the game.

36
00:03:00,874 --> 00:03:03,756
So in August 2017, the full version of the Shrouded Isle

37
00:03:03,756 --> 00:03:05,818
was released for PC and OSX.

38
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:07,779
Later that year, due to positive reception,

39
00:03:07,779 --> 00:03:11,041
we released a free expansion pack called Sunken Sins.

40
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,362
And just recently, in January,

41
00:03:12,362 --> 00:03:14,803
we released a switch port of the Shrouded Isle,

42
00:03:14,803 --> 00:03:17,625
and in March, we released it for Japan region as well.

43
00:03:19,484 --> 00:03:23,327
So what do I mean by emergent tragedies and what does that have to do with the Shrouded Isle?

44
00:03:23,327 --> 00:03:25,328
It goes back to the game jam.

45
00:03:25,328 --> 00:03:28,090
The theme was, you are the monster.

46
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:32,854
And instead of making a game about a physical monster, we wanted to explore why someone

47
00:03:32,854 --> 00:03:34,135
makes monstrous choices.

48
00:03:34,135 --> 00:03:40,380
Why does the leader of a community take actions that clearly harm members of that community?

49
00:03:41,337 --> 00:03:44,880
And in tackling that theme, we wanted to maintain ludonarrative congruence,

50
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,824
which is to say that the narrative is told through the gameplay.

51
00:03:48,824 --> 00:03:51,446
But you might be more familiar with the more common term,

52
00:03:51,446 --> 00:03:55,791
ludonarrative dissonance, in which the narrative is undermined by the mechanics.

53
00:03:56,986 --> 00:04:03,068
So our creative goals were difficult to achieve because we needed to depict this dystopian society of the cults.

54
00:04:03,068 --> 00:04:08,769
But a lot of the design references we could find had this underlying utopian or heroic assumptions

55
00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:13,891
and had the risk of undermining the tragic narrative that we wanted to tell.

56
00:04:13,891 --> 00:04:22,553
To give a quick comparison, we wanted to depict a stagnant society that tries to control and constrain its people.

57
00:04:23,274 --> 00:04:29,720
By contrast, utopian games tend to focus on growth through the empowerment of a protagonist or the expansion of a community.

58
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,764
We wanted to explore the divisions within the cult.

59
00:04:33,764 --> 00:04:35,846
What political games are being played?

60
00:04:35,846 --> 00:04:38,668
Who is seen as virtuous or sinful?

61
00:04:38,668 --> 00:04:42,472
But most games we found depicted unity or assumed unity instead,

62
00:04:42,472 --> 00:04:46,355
whether it's a band of adventurers or an army that's loyal to a greater cause.

63
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:51,138
Most importantly, though, we wanted the gameplay to depict failure.

64
00:04:51,138 --> 00:04:56,645
Telling a story about a corrupt society in which the leaders do whatever it takes to

65
00:04:56,645 --> 00:04:57,946
maintain their regime.

66
00:04:57,946 --> 00:05:04,894
But the majority of examples we found had an underlying message of triumph.

67
00:05:04,894 --> 00:05:08,558
Depicting victory over an evil foe or prosperity of a community.

68
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,383
So why make emergent tragedies?

69
00:05:12,383 --> 00:05:15,905
Because it allows us to depict dystopias and moral grayness

70
00:05:15,905 --> 00:05:18,806
while achieving ludonarrative congruence.

71
00:05:18,806 --> 00:05:21,748
The narrative is told through the gameplay.

72
00:05:21,748 --> 00:05:23,849
We can make more impactful experiences

73
00:05:23,849 --> 00:05:26,410
than scripted content because the player becomes

74
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,892
an active participant and thereby causes

75
00:05:28,892 --> 00:05:31,513
their own downfall, or in rare cases,

76
00:05:31,513 --> 00:05:33,314
succeeds at an immense cost.

77
00:05:34,649 --> 00:05:36,190
But doing this is very challenging,

78
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:38,671
because we have to find alternative gameplay elements

79
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:41,032
to replace key aspects of utopian design.

80
00:05:41,032 --> 00:05:45,093
So this talk will be analyzing three gameplay elements

81
00:05:45,093 --> 00:05:47,714
that were used in the Shrouded Isle

82
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:49,375
to create emergent tragedies.

83
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,816
So first we'll look at how physical resources

84
00:05:51,816 --> 00:05:54,737
were replaced entirely with psychological resources.

85
00:05:54,737 --> 00:05:56,958
Then we'll talk about the core gameplay,

86
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,999
examining how process-oriented mechanics

87
00:05:58,999 --> 00:06:01,880
were replaced with character-oriented mechanics.

88
00:06:02,482 --> 00:06:04,404
Finally, we'll talk about progression systems.

89
00:06:04,404 --> 00:06:07,086
Spatial expansion or tech upgrades

90
00:06:07,086 --> 00:06:08,888
were substituted with progression

91
00:06:08,888 --> 00:06:10,430
through information gathering.

92
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,832
So let's first talk about resources.

93
00:06:12,832 --> 00:06:16,735
In the Game Jam version, two of the town's resources

94
00:06:16,735 --> 00:06:18,377
were physical, food and shelter.

95
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:21,359
This was a sensible need for the town,

96
00:06:21,359 --> 00:06:23,682
but it was too easy for the player to stock up

97
00:06:23,682 --> 00:06:26,664
and fill the bar and imply a state of prosperity

98
00:06:26,664 --> 00:06:27,165
for the town.

99
00:06:28,066 --> 00:06:32,808
And we could have balanced the resource management to make the state of prosperity difficult to achieve,

100
00:06:32,808 --> 00:06:39,570
but there was a deeper problem in that directly managing food and shelter really felt irrelevant to a cult leader's interests.

101
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:46,293
So in the final release, we replaced all physical resources with psychological resources.

102
00:06:46,293 --> 00:06:51,855
This way, the core economy of the game revolves around what a cult leader would care about, faith and politics.

103
00:06:53,323 --> 00:06:56,504
So in the bottom row there, you see the five virtues of the cult.

104
00:06:56,504 --> 00:07:00,325
Ignorance, fervor, discipline, penitence, and obedience.

105
00:07:00,325 --> 00:07:05,266
These variables are affected by the actions and traits of the townspeople.

106
00:07:05,266 --> 00:07:07,387
If characters behave virtuously, the bars go up.

107
00:07:07,387 --> 00:07:10,188
If they behave sinfully, the bars go down.

108
00:07:10,188 --> 00:07:13,328
If the bar slips below the threshold for too long,

109
00:07:13,328 --> 00:07:15,809
the people lose faith in the cult and the game ends.

110
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:19,760
The upper row holds the political resources,

111
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,281
the opinions of the five great houses of the village.

112
00:07:23,281 --> 00:07:25,662
So on the far left, you'll see that House Kegney

113
00:07:25,662 --> 00:07:28,323
feels satisfied with the regime,

114
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:30,943
while neighboring House Iosefka in the second column

115
00:07:30,943 --> 00:07:32,444
feels merely neutral.

116
00:07:32,444 --> 00:07:35,185
When you bestow favor on a house

117
00:07:35,185 --> 00:07:36,865
by using their members as advisors,

118
00:07:36,865 --> 00:07:39,726
their opinions go up and their opinion goes down

119
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:42,867
when you exclude them or kill members of their family

120
00:07:42,867 --> 00:07:44,428
for this seasonal sacrifice.

121
00:07:45,818 --> 00:07:47,839
If any has his opinion drops too low for too long,

122
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:50,020
they revolt and the game ends.

123
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:54,242
So the big benefit of using psychological resources

124
00:07:54,242 --> 00:07:56,923
is that the player embraces the values

125
00:07:56,923 --> 00:07:57,743
of the cult implicitly.

126
00:07:57,743 --> 00:08:01,925
Even if the player personally disagrees in the real world

127
00:08:01,925 --> 00:08:03,505
that raising ignorance is a good thing,

128
00:08:03,505 --> 00:08:06,406
they quickly learn that it is absolutely necessary

129
00:08:06,406 --> 00:08:08,287
for their cult to survive in the game.

130
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:10,548
Furthermore, they are

131
00:08:11,577 --> 00:08:17,805
The psychological resources are divorced from objective reality or survival of the townspeople.

132
00:08:17,805 --> 00:08:22,510
So as a result, the player's narrative interests are dissociated from the villager's narrative

133
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:28,578
interests, which motivates the players to make rather Machiavellian decisions when difficult

134
00:08:28,578 --> 00:08:29,359
situations arise.

135
00:08:31,425 --> 00:08:35,367
There's a further benefit in that you can keep the game in a state of volatile stagnation.

136
00:08:35,367 --> 00:08:39,909
As opposed to having an economy that just keeps growing and growing and growing over

137
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:44,591
the course of a playthrough, the overall size remains relatively stagnant or even in slight

138
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:45,832
decline.

139
00:08:45,832 --> 00:08:51,535
So, at the same time, the individual resources have high volatility so that the crises in

140
00:08:51,535 --> 00:08:53,135
the game emerge dynamically.

141
00:08:54,176 --> 00:08:55,457
So let me give you a quick example.

142
00:08:55,457 --> 00:08:57,739
I'm going to select Chessa on the very far left

143
00:08:57,739 --> 00:09:01,863
of the advisors list as my lead advisor this season.

144
00:09:01,863 --> 00:09:03,824
She belongs to House Kegney,

145
00:09:03,824 --> 00:09:05,926
so she specializes in burning books.

146
00:09:05,926 --> 00:09:08,789
If she succeeds, she'll raise ignorance

147
00:09:08,789 --> 00:09:10,030
by a moderate amount this month.

148
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:13,473
She's also personally a sadist,

149
00:09:13,473 --> 00:09:16,595
so she'll raise fervor significantly by her example.

150
00:09:16,595 --> 00:09:18,817
This is really great because fervor

151
00:09:18,817 --> 00:09:20,198
is dangerously low right now.

152
00:09:21,719 --> 00:09:26,581
She is also rebellious, which is a major vice.

153
00:09:26,581 --> 00:09:28,001
By using her as an advisor,

154
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:31,442
her example will reduce obedience of the town

155
00:09:31,442 --> 00:09:32,303
below the critical threshold,

156
00:09:32,303 --> 00:09:36,284
and therefore create an overall disobedience problem

157
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,144
for the village.

158
00:09:37,144 --> 00:09:39,805
In terms of politics,

159
00:09:39,805 --> 00:09:43,046
House Kegney will understandably be very happy

160
00:09:43,046 --> 00:09:45,227
that you entrusted Chesa to lead the town,

161
00:09:45,227 --> 00:09:47,668
and they become zealous supporters of your regime.

162
00:09:49,209 --> 00:09:56,277
In exchange, every other house is somewhat insulted and envious and counterbalances the economy.

163
00:09:56,277 --> 00:10:07,289
In the Epherson's case, it pushes them down just enough so that it breaks their camel's back, so to speak, and they will rebel next season.

164
00:10:07,289 --> 00:10:10,213
So maybe choosing Chesa isn't the best option right now.

165
00:10:12,158 --> 00:10:21,281
As we saw with the example, a simple choice of who should lead the town for a month was given a complex nuance because of the volatility of the individual variables.

166
00:10:21,281 --> 00:10:26,162
Each gain is counterbalanced by a comparable loss in other variables.

167
00:10:26,162 --> 00:10:36,324
So while having the high volatility for the individual variables, we avoid having a spiraling growth or collapse, which would unbalance the gameplay and also undermine the narrative.

168
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:47,202
And we theoretically could have done this with physical resources, but I find that psychological resources are far easier to justify as having this volatility that I needed.

169
00:10:47,202 --> 00:10:55,705
Because it's easier to explain that Chessa is a fervent person who sometimes goes too far and tends to be disobedient and rebellious,

170
00:10:55,705 --> 00:11:02,067
rather than trying to justify why gathering food would result in destruction of shelters or decay of shelters.

171
00:11:04,505 --> 00:11:07,887
Reigns is a game that uses psychological resources to depict tragic outcomes.

172
00:11:07,887 --> 00:11:13,611
The resources in the game simultaneously represent the physical amount of something as well as

173
00:11:13,611 --> 00:11:14,852
the faction's strength.

174
00:11:14,852 --> 00:11:20,376
So, for example, the sword represents the physical size of your army as well as their

175
00:11:20,376 --> 00:11:23,057
relative political influence within your kingdom.

176
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:28,861
If the bar is empty, your kingdom can't defend itself and becomes conquered by an invader.

177
00:11:28,861 --> 00:11:32,484
If the bar is too full, your general overthrows you in a coup d'etat.

178
00:11:33,412 --> 00:11:37,615
This careful balancing act combined with the volatile outcomes creates cascading crises.

179
00:11:37,615 --> 00:11:43,039
But at the same time, their economy is very fragile and strategic play is difficult without

180
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:44,500
memorizing the card outcomes.

181
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:50,825
So at some level, I do find that this undermines the player ownership of choices, but it works

182
00:11:50,825 --> 00:11:55,668
fine for Reigns because it embraces death with a whimsical tone and has a dynastic meta

183
00:11:55,668 --> 00:11:56,549
progression system.

184
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,891
So even if you die, you get something in the end.

185
00:12:00,985 --> 00:12:05,247
Moving on, let's talk about character-oriented mechanics.

186
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:08,949
Utopian simulations tend to have process-oriented mechanics.

187
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:10,889
Critical actions or systems in the game

188
00:12:10,889 --> 00:12:13,170
are abstracted industrial processes

189
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,591
or are done through an organization.

190
00:12:15,591 --> 00:12:17,492
A residential zone is drawn.

191
00:12:17,492 --> 00:12:19,493
Income is received every month.

192
00:12:19,493 --> 00:12:22,074
A research project is chosen and just completes over time.

193
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,055
Even when characters are involved,

194
00:12:24,055 --> 00:12:27,456
they are largely interchangeable and only matter

195
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:29,977
as far as how quickly they gather something or speed up

196
00:12:29,977 --> 00:12:30,697
the process.

197
00:12:32,086 --> 00:12:34,227
So going back to the Game Jam version for a second,

198
00:12:34,227 --> 00:12:37,748
at the time we also had a very process-oriented game.

199
00:12:37,748 --> 00:12:40,348
The player gave orders at the house level,

200
00:12:40,348 --> 00:12:42,749
so like house Kegney would gather food

201
00:12:42,749 --> 00:12:45,770
or house Josefka would build shelters and so forth.

202
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:48,110
And the results were calculated in aggregate

203
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,571
because it really didn't matter how each house

204
00:12:50,571 --> 00:12:51,992
gathered a particular resource.

205
00:12:53,103 --> 00:12:58,926
This felt dissatisfying because similar to what we were talking about with the psychological

206
00:12:58,926 --> 00:13:04,489
resources earlier, it didn't seem like what a cult leader would want to do or care about.

207
00:13:04,489 --> 00:13:09,072
We wanted the player to engage with individual characters, judging for themselves whether

208
00:13:09,072 --> 00:13:12,033
a villager is virtuous or sinful.

209
00:13:12,033 --> 00:13:15,575
We wanted the player to have a reason to want to sacrifice somebody.

210
00:13:17,325 --> 00:13:20,686
So we changed the mechanic to be entirely character-oriented instead.

211
00:13:20,686 --> 00:13:26,570
The goal was to dramatize resource management by having the player act through or act upon

212
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:31,052
characters whose behavior was fundamentally unpredictable.

213
00:13:31,052 --> 00:13:35,514
While the player can order characters to do something, they can't fully control what they

214
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:37,175
do or what the outcome will be.

215
00:13:37,175 --> 00:13:39,777
So let's go back to Chessa again.

216
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:43,619
So in this playthrough, I don't really know her very well, but I'm still going to select

217
00:13:43,619 --> 00:13:45,500
her as a representative for House Keg.

218
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:50,153
I'm going to need her help desperately this season because ignorance is at a critical

219
00:13:50,153 --> 00:13:53,843
level and members of House Kegney are responsible for raising it.

220
00:13:56,953 --> 00:14:01,076
As I don't know her very well, it's going to be hard to predict how she will impact the town.

221
00:14:01,076 --> 00:14:06,920
We know that because she's part of the Cagney family, she will most likely raise ignorance.

222
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,001
But we don't know how severe her vice is.

223
00:14:09,001 --> 00:14:13,204
According to rumors, as you can see on the second tray under her name,

224
00:14:13,204 --> 00:14:15,025
she is rumored to be disobedient.

225
00:14:15,025 --> 00:14:18,367
So I'm just going to trust for now that it's not too serious.

226
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:21,910
Unfortunately, Chessa screws up.

227
00:14:23,317 --> 00:14:29,921
She fails to find enough books to burn, and instead of raising ignorance, she actually reduces it instead.

228
00:14:29,921 --> 00:14:32,002
Not only that, her vice might be severe.

229
00:14:32,002 --> 00:14:37,166
We don't know exactly what she did, but she completely reduced the town's obedience.

230
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:42,329
This is an infuriating outcome, because not only did she fail at what I trusted her to do,

231
00:14:42,329 --> 00:14:45,951
she turns out to be a terrible sinner who is misleading my people.

232
00:14:48,011 --> 00:14:53,254
I trusted Chessa because as the player, I was engaged with her at every single step.

233
00:14:53,254 --> 00:14:57,116
I personally appointed her, and then I personally ordered her to burn books.

234
00:14:57,116 --> 00:15:01,979
Due to the stress, I had a certain expectation of her, which she did not fulfill.

235
00:15:01,979 --> 00:15:04,640
I felt betrayed by her because...

236
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:08,725
She was an individual that did this,

237
00:15:08,725 --> 00:15:10,946
and she was personally connected to me

238
00:15:10,946 --> 00:15:13,307
as a result of my orders to her.

239
00:15:13,307 --> 00:15:16,309
If an industrial process or an organization

240
00:15:16,309 --> 00:15:17,349
resulted in this outcome,

241
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:19,250
I would only have myself to blame.

242
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,771
But due to having character-oriented mechanics,

243
00:15:21,771 --> 00:15:24,213
we added dramatic context to what would otherwise

244
00:15:24,213 --> 00:15:26,794
be a really banal resource acquisition action.

245
00:15:29,037 --> 00:15:32,781
Another game that uses character-oriented mechanics to tell emergent narratives about

246
00:15:32,781 --> 00:15:36,144
expectations and betrayal is, of course, Darkest Dungeon.

247
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:40,608
The player sends parties of adventurers down to these deadly crypts, and for the most part,

248
00:15:40,608 --> 00:15:42,470
the characters will obey the player's orders.

249
00:15:43,347 --> 00:15:48,031
However, as their stress rises from all the horrors that they encounter,

250
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:55,717
the party gains afflictions, which are negative traits that permanently change how the character behaves.

251
00:15:55,717 --> 00:16:00,500
So, for example, being hopeless not only causes debuffs to the character,

252
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,962
it causes the character to ignore the player's orders.

253
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:07,405
Having one character with an affliction is manageable, but...

254
00:16:08,326 --> 00:16:12,211
it snowballs very quickly and eventually unless you pull out,

255
00:16:12,211 --> 00:16:14,734
the entire party will be full of afflictions.

256
00:16:14,734 --> 00:16:21,122
One thing that Darkest Dungeon does well is counterbalancing this,

257
00:16:21,122 --> 00:16:25,508
subverting this with the mechanic of virtues.

258
00:16:25,508 --> 00:16:25,648
So.

259
00:16:26,369 --> 00:16:29,552
There's a small chance that instead of gaining an affliction,

260
00:16:29,552 --> 00:16:33,056
you gain a positive trait which boosts the party instead.

261
00:16:33,056 --> 00:16:34,637
So for instance, being courageous

262
00:16:34,637 --> 00:16:36,599
as opposed to being hopeless.

263
00:16:36,599 --> 00:16:38,741
By doing so, the game subverts the player's

264
00:16:38,741 --> 00:16:40,863
negative expectation in a positive way,

265
00:16:40,863 --> 00:16:44,267
creating emergent narratives of heroism and turnabout.

266
00:16:44,267 --> 00:16:49,212
Moving on, let's talk about progression systems.

267
00:16:51,573 --> 00:16:53,313
We looked at two conventional approaches,

268
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:55,174
which would have been to go wide

269
00:16:55,174 --> 00:16:58,815
and allow for spatial expansion

270
00:16:58,815 --> 00:17:00,235
and go tall and allow for upgrades.

271
00:17:00,235 --> 00:17:02,196
But thinking about it,

272
00:17:02,196 --> 00:17:04,536
it felt incompatible with the narrative

273
00:17:04,536 --> 00:17:07,877
because the island is isolated from the world

274
00:17:07,877 --> 00:17:11,278
and has a dwindling population due to ritual sacrifices.

275
00:17:11,278 --> 00:17:13,659
To have a progression system

276
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:16,279
without having the cult grow in any way,

277
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:18,220
we decided to use information.

278
00:17:19,728 --> 00:17:23,151
The way it works is through the townspeople and their traits.

279
00:17:23,151 --> 00:17:24,772
So let's take Bogdan here for an example.

280
00:17:24,772 --> 00:17:26,594
At the start of the playthrough,

281
00:17:26,594 --> 00:17:29,737
we might not know anything about Bogdan's behavior.

282
00:17:29,737 --> 00:17:32,620
But as the cult leader, the player has the right

283
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,461
to investigate, excuse me,

284
00:17:34,461 --> 00:17:37,905
investigate members of their village for their behavior.

285
00:17:37,905 --> 00:17:40,507
So if we inquire about Bogdan's virtue,

286
00:17:40,507 --> 00:17:43,129
at the next stage, we understand

287
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:45,372
that he's rumored to be obedient.

288
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:51,110
But we still don't know exactly how much he will affect the town's obedience until we

289
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:56,595
inquire about him again, and then it's revealed that he is timid, and we'll add five points

290
00:17:56,595 --> 00:17:58,036
of obedience every season.

291
00:17:58,036 --> 00:18:02,660
Through revealing traits, the player is given subjective rewards.

292
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:05,042
The characters themselves do not change at all.

293
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:08,505
They behave exactly the same, no matter how much their trait has been revealed.

294
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:12,348
Instead, the player's perception of that character changes.

295
00:18:12,728 --> 00:18:16,329
Since the player can more accurately predict the character's impact,

296
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:19,069
they can make better decisions as they reveal more traits.

297
00:18:19,069 --> 00:18:24,390
There's also a change in the villager's perception of that character in the final phase.

298
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:29,651
So if the player unveils the fullest extent of a character's virtue or vice,

299
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:34,152
it changes the bonuses and penalties in the sacrifice phase.

300
00:18:34,152 --> 00:18:35,233
So let's go back to Chessa.

301
00:18:35,233 --> 00:18:38,633
She drained the town's obedience because of her vice,

302
00:18:38,633 --> 00:18:41,654
but we don't know exactly what that vice is yet.

303
00:18:43,107 --> 00:18:47,410
When we inquire about it, we discover that she is rebellious.

304
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:48,631
This is a major vice.

305
00:18:48,631 --> 00:18:54,815
At the end of the season, we have to choose one of the five advisors to sacrifice.

306
00:18:54,815 --> 00:18:57,556
And I'm going to make an example out of Chessa.

307
00:18:57,556 --> 00:19:01,819
Because I've exposed that she is rebellious,

308
00:19:01,819 --> 00:19:05,522
I'm able to make her family grudgingly accept this final outcome.

309
00:19:06,508 --> 00:19:08,509
Furthermore, her village, sorry,

310
00:19:08,509 --> 00:19:11,270
her death will send a message to the village,

311
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:17,832
restoring some of the lost obedience.

312
00:19:17,832 --> 00:19:19,752
With Chessa's death, justice is served

313
00:19:19,752 --> 00:19:23,253
and the villagers have learned a lesson.

314
00:19:23,253 --> 00:19:25,794
As you saw, the benefit of using information progression

315
00:19:25,794 --> 00:19:29,575
is that it allows us to temporarily blind the player.

316
00:19:29,575 --> 00:19:31,535
By giving access to incomplete information,

317
00:19:31,535 --> 00:19:33,416
we can create scenarios in which players'

318
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:35,257
good intentions go terribly wrong.

319
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:38,432
It's in the player's best interest to gain information,

320
00:19:38,432 --> 00:19:40,954
so therefore the player is motivated

321
00:19:40,954 --> 00:19:42,295
to get to know the characters,

322
00:19:42,295 --> 00:19:44,537
which adds support to the character-oriented mechanics

323
00:19:44,537 --> 00:19:46,379
that we talked about in the previous section.

324
00:19:46,379 --> 00:19:50,203
And granted, this approach can be frustrating

325
00:19:50,203 --> 00:19:53,226
if the situation is completely opaque or unreadable,

326
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:56,348
but the gameplay remains fair

327
00:19:56,348 --> 00:19:58,751
as long as the player is given some information

328
00:19:58,751 --> 00:20:00,793
and has active means of acquiring more.

329
00:20:01,521 --> 00:20:05,604
In fact, I would say that the player is rewarded for being prudent and having foresight as

330
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:11,809
long as they can make reasonable assumptions about the missing information.

331
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:16,953
Probably the single best example of information progression is Return of the Aubrey Dinn.

332
00:20:16,953 --> 00:20:21,296
The player is trying to figure out the fate of the crew and passengers on the Aubrey Dinn

333
00:20:21,296 --> 00:20:24,359
by using a magic pocket watch to go back to the moment of their death.

334
00:20:25,197 --> 00:20:29,159
By carefully observing the snapshot flashbacks

335
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:31,981
for what the characters say, what they do,

336
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:34,743
and whom they associate with,

337
00:20:34,743 --> 00:20:39,146
the player slowly pieces together faces with names

338
00:20:39,146 --> 00:20:40,267
until the truth is revealed.

339
00:20:40,267 --> 00:20:42,949
The game discourages guessing

340
00:20:42,949 --> 00:20:47,732
by only confirming your answers in sets of three,

341
00:20:47,732 --> 00:20:49,253
and directly warning the player

342
00:20:49,253 --> 00:20:51,835
if not enough information has been found

343
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:53,916
to be able to actually identify the character.

344
00:20:55,019 --> 00:20:57,140
All the same, an astute player is able

345
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:00,101
to make reasonable predictions about a character's identity

346
00:21:00,101 --> 00:21:02,382
long before having enough evidence

347
00:21:02,382 --> 00:21:04,383
based on their appearance, occupation,

348
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:07,585
and the language that they speak.

349
00:21:07,585 --> 00:21:10,186
So to bring this all together,

350
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:12,527
emergent tragedies allow players

351
00:21:12,527 --> 00:21:14,748
to create their own downfall.

352
00:21:14,748 --> 00:21:18,169
We can tell narratives about dystopias and moral grayness,

353
00:21:18,169 --> 00:21:20,710
not through scripted content, but through gameplay itself.

354
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:26,033
Psychological resources are the fundamental step in this,

355
00:21:26,033 --> 00:21:28,595
and that it encourages players to embrace

356
00:21:28,595 --> 00:21:32,199
alternative paradigms and discourage min-maxing.

357
00:21:32,199 --> 00:21:35,522
Even if the player personally does not agree

358
00:21:35,522 --> 00:21:37,524
with the values of the cult and the Shrouded Isle,

359
00:21:37,524 --> 00:21:39,926
they must implicitly accept them within the game

360
00:21:39,926 --> 00:21:44,570
as their survival and success depends on them.

361
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:46,732
Character-oriented mechanics then dramatize

362
00:21:46,732 --> 00:21:48,053
this resource management.

363
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:52,003
By having most, if not all, mechanics in a game

364
00:21:52,003 --> 00:21:55,226
revolve around characters, we can tell powerful narratives

365
00:21:55,226 --> 00:22:00,289
about expectation and betrayal.

366
00:22:00,289 --> 00:22:02,111
Finally, progression through information

367
00:22:02,111 --> 00:22:04,432
allows players to improve over time

368
00:22:04,432 --> 00:22:06,053
without direct empowerment.

369
00:22:07,213 --> 00:22:10,355
Instead of gaining more resources through spatial expansion

370
00:22:10,355 --> 00:22:13,296
or refining them through technological upgrades,

371
00:22:13,296 --> 00:22:15,537
players effectively become more intelligent

372
00:22:15,537 --> 00:22:16,937
through the course of a playthrough

373
00:22:16,937 --> 00:22:18,598
by being able to better predict

374
00:22:18,598 --> 00:22:20,218
the consequences of their actions.

375
00:22:20,218 --> 00:22:22,879
This also creates opportunity

376
00:22:22,879 --> 00:22:24,180
in the middle of the playthrough

377
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,921
for good intentions to go terribly, terribly wrong.

378
00:22:26,921 --> 00:22:30,162
For our latest project,

379
00:22:30,162 --> 00:22:32,523
we've taken principles from the Shrouded Isle

380
00:22:32,523 --> 00:22:34,384
and adapted them for the mystery genre.

381
00:22:35,037 --> 00:22:38,759
It's an experimental project that focuses on subjectivity of testimonies

382
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:41,300
and relies entirely on information progression.

383
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,281
If you're curious, we'll be showcasing a seven-minute demo

384
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:46,382
at the Experimental Gameplay Workshop on Friday.

385
00:22:46,382 --> 00:22:49,123
That's it for the talk. Thank you very much.

386
00:22:49,123 --> 00:22:59,367
I think we have time for questions.

387
00:22:59,367 --> 00:23:01,568
The microphone is in the middle.

388
00:23:06,538 --> 00:23:12,901
I'm just curious, you've got a game about dystopia and mechanics there, you know, about

389
00:23:12,901 --> 00:23:14,182
managing psychological needs.

390
00:23:14,182 --> 00:23:21,245
Did you ever have confusion when playtesters were playing to try to determine what constitutes

391
00:23:21,245 --> 00:23:22,525
a win in your game?

392
00:23:22,525 --> 00:23:27,887
Like, how do I make a decision that I know is, does the game think this is a good decision?

393
00:23:27,887 --> 00:23:29,488
It seems like a bad decision?

394
00:23:29,488 --> 00:23:35,010
Are you asking, were there cases in which the player was confused about the...

395
00:23:36,766 --> 00:23:40,909
the purpose of a certain resource or the goal of the game?

396
00:23:40,909 --> 00:23:42,891
More like the goal of the game.

397
00:23:42,891 --> 00:23:45,613
Was the intention to leave players kind of wondering

398
00:23:45,613 --> 00:23:47,735
whether or not they're progressing to what would be

399
00:23:47,735 --> 00:23:50,717
defined as a win state, or is that kind of part of the

400
00:23:50,717 --> 00:23:54,240
purpose of the game that the players are questioning?

401
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,882
Am I winning this game?

402
00:23:56,882 --> 00:24:00,705
Clearly I get the bars below the threshold and I lose, but

403
00:24:01,737 --> 00:24:05,101
what is the sum of the correct decisions that I've made and is that going to take me to

404
00:24:05,101 --> 00:24:08,384
something that constitutes a win or at the end do I just feel like a bad person?

405
00:24:08,384 --> 00:24:13,991
Okay so to summarize then the question is were there confusions by players about the

406
00:24:13,991 --> 00:24:17,655
goal of the game and was that intentional as far as the experience is concerned?

407
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:34,955
I would say that at the start of development it was not intentional, but as we observed playtests and that we found that by the second playthrough players grokked it, or just the survival of the first season of the players grokked it, we just embraced that side of the game.

408
00:24:35,993 --> 00:24:42,697
An interesting anecdote for me is that I often observe that the player tends to embrace their

409
00:24:42,697 --> 00:24:44,958
inner tyrant by the second season.

410
00:24:44,958 --> 00:24:49,861
So the first season of a game, people will try to be good, whatever that means, but then

411
00:24:49,861 --> 00:24:55,264
they realize that, hey, being good in my sense doesn't actually help me be successful in

412
00:24:55,264 --> 00:24:55,704
this game.

413
00:24:55,704 --> 00:25:00,407
And then their mindsets shift, and it's a bit disconcerting.

414
00:25:01,216 --> 00:25:05,882
Like a disconcerting to watch but I mean in some ways it's a success in other ways

415
00:25:05,882 --> 00:25:12,590
I wish that there was a moral like a longer moral dilemma that happened that that would be the intended experience from my perspective

416
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:13,771
Thank you. Cheers

417
00:25:15,218 --> 00:25:17,760
Hey, so sort of bouncing off that first, I love the game,

418
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,801
thank you for making it.

419
00:25:18,801 --> 00:25:21,963
The game made me turn into a bad person,

420
00:25:21,963 --> 00:25:24,645
which is normally hard in RPG games for me.

421
00:25:24,645 --> 00:25:26,566
But something I noticed is that, yeah,

422
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:28,568
like around the second season,

423
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:30,489
I began to feel more apathetic

424
00:25:30,489 --> 00:25:34,132
because I was embracing this like dictatorship role

425
00:25:34,132 --> 00:25:35,053
in the community.

426
00:25:35,053 --> 00:25:37,495
And it began to in some ways sort of conflict

427
00:25:37,495 --> 00:25:40,117
with some of my gameplay behavior

428
00:25:40,117 --> 00:25:42,498
because I was developing a kind of apathy.

429
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:45,920
to the characters, to the world, because I wanted to succeed so well.

430
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:50,282
So I was curious if you had any thoughts on how, you know, I think this awesome goal

431
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:55,103
of having people embrace this more darker side of leadership and playing with apathy

432
00:25:55,103 --> 00:26:00,925
as a narrative construct can sometimes conflict or maybe in some ways enhance the apathy

433
00:26:00,925 --> 00:26:04,486
that we can develop as a player and if that's something that is negative

434
00:26:04,486 --> 00:26:07,367
or if that's something you think we can gain some cool experiences from.

435
00:26:09,697 --> 00:26:13,078
Okay, so is the question, sorry I'm just trying to grok the full question.

436
00:26:13,078 --> 00:26:13,358
Yeah.

437
00:26:13,358 --> 00:26:19,141
So is the question something like, given that there's a certain apathy or distance that's

438
00:26:19,141 --> 00:26:25,764
like inherent to the structure of the game, how do I feel about that as far as a design

439
00:26:25,764 --> 00:26:26,244
choice?

440
00:26:26,244 --> 00:26:31,246
Yes, and how does that conflict with, often times as game designers, we want the opposite

441
00:26:31,246 --> 00:26:32,027
of that for gameplay.

442
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:37,965
Right? So how does that apathy that you get as being this protagonist conflict with the gameplay apathy?

443
00:26:37,965 --> 00:26:39,406
And just if you have any thoughts about that.

444
00:26:39,406 --> 00:26:46,274
Right. So the interesting thing about that is that I often find that the players have very

445
00:26:48,472 --> 00:26:55,514
Let me rephrase, certain players have a certain desire to be empathetic with the characters.

446
00:26:55,514 --> 00:27:00,895
So the generation of the characters are, it's very, very simple in the Stratodile compared to like a Roguelike, let's say,

447
00:27:00,895 --> 00:27:03,916
or like a Dwarf, compared to something like Dwarf Fortress, like it doesn't hold a candle.

448
00:27:03,916 --> 00:27:08,437
But there's a portrait, there's two traits, one positive, one negative.

449
00:27:08,437 --> 00:27:13,498
And for many players, that's enough to perceive a personality within that.

450
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:17,259
And P players tend to get attached to...

451
00:27:17,744 --> 00:27:19,685
those personalities.

452
00:27:19,685 --> 00:27:22,386
And we also have a system where you can rename the character.

453
00:27:22,386 --> 00:27:25,008
So in some cases, like, you've named this person

454
00:27:25,008 --> 00:27:27,409
after your friend, are you really gonna, you know?

455
00:27:27,409 --> 00:27:30,851
And so that sort of attachment, I feel,

456
00:27:30,851 --> 00:27:34,552
there's just little things that adds up to

457
00:27:35,293 --> 00:27:39,337
if you will, like certain threshold in which the players become attached to that character.

458
00:27:39,337 --> 00:27:48,707
And so I didn't feel, for this project anyway, that the apathy that you developed would conflict

459
00:27:48,707 --> 00:27:53,932
with my motivation. But if I were trying to make a game in which I wanted the player to deeply,

460
00:27:53,932 --> 00:27:56,075
deeply care about the people in the town,

461
00:27:56,417 --> 00:28:01,484
I would agree that the Machiavellian nature

462
00:28:01,484 --> 00:28:04,087
of the project would have been a poor fit.

463
00:28:04,087 --> 00:28:04,648
Yeah, totally.

464
00:28:04,648 --> 00:28:05,169
OK, thank you.

465
00:28:05,169 --> 00:28:05,729
Cool, thanks.

466
00:28:05,729 --> 00:28:14,120
No other questions?

467
00:28:16,492 --> 00:28:24,400
You mentioned randomness in the different heads of the houses and things like that.

468
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:30,247
And I was wondering if it, because I haven't played it myself, but it looks really cool.

469
00:28:30,943 --> 00:28:36,025
If it is just completely random of like, you know, given the context of the world state

470
00:28:36,025 --> 00:28:39,967
of the game and, you know, the resources, you could get something really good, you could

471
00:28:39,967 --> 00:28:45,228
get something really bad, or have you guys considered or tried to put in like, you know,

472
00:28:45,228 --> 00:28:48,349
any sort of AI that would kind of read the room and decide based off of what the player

473
00:28:48,349 --> 00:28:51,851
is doing and what they have, what would be the most interesting, you know, traits to

474
00:28:51,851 --> 00:28:52,451
give something.

475
00:28:53,003 --> 00:28:56,885
Okay, so if I understand you right, is it like, how did you balance the randomness versus

476
00:28:56,885 --> 00:28:59,205
like the intentionality of the project?

477
00:28:59,205 --> 00:29:02,886
Like if it's just, you know, pure, is it a full-on slot machine of what you get or is

478
00:29:02,886 --> 00:29:05,087
there a little bit of like crafted behind it?

479
00:29:05,087 --> 00:29:11,749
I would say that initially I would have wanted the project to be as deterministic as possible

480
00:29:11,749 --> 00:29:14,710
other than the initial starting conditions for the town.

481
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:20,772
But what I've observed over time is that the design space becomes very, very narrow and

482
00:29:20,772 --> 00:29:21,152
the... .

483
00:29:23,317 --> 00:29:25,238
Because the game is about failure, right?

484
00:29:25,238 --> 00:29:27,799
Imagine if you're able to predict every op.

485
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,940
Let's say we play rock, paper, scissors, right?

486
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:30,720
And then I tell you,

487
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,901
hey, I'm gonna play rock next turn.

488
00:29:32,901 --> 00:29:34,421
Are you ever gonna use scissors?

489
00:29:34,421 --> 00:29:37,042
Other than for just for the fun of it, you know?

490
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:41,984
So in that way, to keep the feeling of being the leader

491
00:29:41,984 --> 00:29:45,426
in a terrible situation, like as,

492
00:29:46,266 --> 00:29:49,209
as relevant as long as possible for the experience.

493
00:29:49,209 --> 00:29:51,411
Like some amount of randomness was added.

494
00:29:51,411 --> 00:29:54,533
But for the most part, there is very little of it,

495
00:29:54,533 --> 00:29:55,314
I would argue.

496
00:29:55,314 --> 00:29:58,457
There's more of missing information.

497
00:29:58,457 --> 00:30:01,619
If the player were able to have like all the towns

498
00:30:01,619 --> 00:30:03,101
that characters traits from the get-go,

499
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:07,064
the lack of randomness in the Shrouded Isle

500
00:30:07,064 --> 00:30:08,325
would be more apparent, I'd say.

501
00:30:08,325 --> 00:30:10,267
Okay, thank you.

502
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:10,487
Cheers.

503
00:30:17,879 --> 00:30:24,524
Since the Shrouded Isle deals a lot with using gameplay that works with systems and exploration,

504
00:30:24,524 --> 00:30:32,971
had you guys at GitFox ever considered basing it on historically power structures or systems

505
00:30:32,971 --> 00:30:37,075
or maybe using this kind of gameplay to explore more historically bent ideas?

506
00:30:37,075 --> 00:30:43,200
So the question is, have we considered exploring historical situations and ideas with systemic

507
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,521
gameplay like this?

508
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:49,911
To tell you the truth, for the Shrouded Isle, we didn't have something specific in mind.

509
00:30:49,911 --> 00:30:51,072
As I said, it came out of a game jam.

510
00:30:51,072 --> 00:30:56,293
But what I find interesting is that after release, a lot of our colleagues kind of projected

511
00:30:56,293 --> 00:31:00,735
like what the game was actually about, like whether it's at a workspace or like, you know,

512
00:31:00,735 --> 00:31:03,456
like at a political party in particular or whatever.

513
00:31:04,736 --> 00:31:09,719
I would want to, like, so I have a background in Soviet history and so I do

514
00:31:09,719 --> 00:31:13,501
want to depict, you know, a single party structure, like, I think it would be a

515
00:31:13,501 --> 00:31:17,443
good fit for the Shrouded Isle, but we haven't moved further, like, in pursuing

516
00:31:17,443 --> 00:31:20,144
those projects yet, but it's something that I would be definitely interested in.

517
00:31:24,108 --> 00:31:26,029
Hi there, thanks for the talk.

518
00:31:26,029 --> 00:31:30,471
I was wondering, you said players took like a whole act

519
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:33,513
to really understand the game.

520
00:31:33,513 --> 00:31:36,654
What do you think that kept the players interested in the game

521
00:31:36,654 --> 00:31:38,535
before they truly understand it?

522
00:31:38,535 --> 00:31:41,296
If I'm going to be blunt, the art.

523
00:31:43,238 --> 00:31:45,640
So I mean, it's an interesting question.

524
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,541
So we thought that the,

525
00:31:47,541 --> 00:31:50,162
so this, we showed the Shrouded Isle multiple times at PAXes

526
00:31:50,162 --> 00:31:52,563
and we were always surprised at the,

527
00:31:52,563 --> 00:31:56,446
the relative amount of attention that a game about bars

528
00:31:56,446 --> 00:32:00,088
going up and down, frankly, gets at a convention.

529
00:32:00,088 --> 00:32:01,869
And it's because of the striking art style

530
00:32:01,869 --> 00:32:05,791
and just like the harsh, like, nature of the game,

531
00:32:05,791 --> 00:32:07,512
the tickles, like, you know,

532
00:32:07,512 --> 00:32:09,553
the right parts of brains, I guess.

533
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:10,373
It's really hard to say.

534
00:32:10,373 --> 00:32:12,554
So honestly, I underestimated.

535
00:32:13,275 --> 00:32:20,099
the level of interest in this project. I thought that it's too weird and too cruel of a project.

536
00:32:20,099 --> 00:32:28,183
But overall, I'm really gratified that it's received the attention that it already has,

537
00:32:28,183 --> 00:32:35,568
frankly. Does that answer the question? Cheers. Okay. That's it for the talk. Thank you very much.

538
00:32:35,568 --> 00:32:37,789
Please fill out your evaluations. And, yeah.
