00:00:09,262 --> 00:00:10,844
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:14,269
Welcome to the first talk of the board game track.

3
00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:16,572
And this is the first year that GDC is doing board games.

4
00:00:16,572 --> 00:00:18,355
So thank you for being here.

5
00:00:25,229 --> 00:00:28,511
I am Rob Davia, this is Matt Leacock,

6
00:00:28,511 --> 00:00:31,353
and we are here to talk about Pandemic Legacy.

7
00:00:31,353 --> 00:00:33,875
If that's not what you meant to hear,

8
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:36,757
you're in the wrong room.

9
00:00:36,757 --> 00:00:38,358
Oh, sorry, I'm not supposed to wander past here

10
00:00:38,358 --> 00:00:39,018
and stay on camera.

11
00:00:39,018 --> 00:00:40,119
You're gonna fall off.

12
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:41,880
Okay.

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,323
Before we begin, I'm just wondering,

14
00:00:45,323 --> 00:00:47,844
or we're just wondering, it's hard to see with the glare,

15
00:00:47,844 --> 00:00:50,726
how many people have played at least some of Pandemic Legacy?

16
00:00:50,726 --> 00:00:53,948
Whoa, okay, how many people played all of it?

17
00:00:55,337 --> 00:00:56,458
All right, get on it, the rest of you.

18
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:58,919
Who has not played it?

19
00:00:58,919 --> 00:01:00,580
Just so I know it's all the people who haven't,

20
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:01,240
but I just show hands.

21
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,502
Okay, we will not be largely and mostly spoiling anything

22
00:01:05,502 --> 00:01:06,583
in Pandemic Legacy,

23
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:09,164
because it is a board game with spoilers.

24
00:01:09,164 --> 00:01:11,925
We will talk elliptically about various things.

25
00:01:11,925 --> 00:01:12,646
So if you've played,

26
00:01:12,646 --> 00:01:14,027
you'll understand what we're talking about.

27
00:01:14,027 --> 00:01:15,007
And if you haven't,

28
00:01:15,007 --> 00:01:17,448
if you do choose to play and you get to it,

29
00:01:17,448 --> 00:01:19,069
you'll say, oh, that's what they were talking about.

30
00:01:20,585 --> 00:01:24,226
Anything else for you know, I think it's I think it's a perfect start.

31
00:01:24,226 --> 00:01:24,386
So.

32
00:01:24,386 --> 00:01:32,668
Here we are there's pandemic legacy this came out in October of 2015.

33
00:01:32,668 --> 00:01:36,749
And represented a combination of 2 different things.

34
00:01:36,749 --> 00:01:40,130
It's based on a legacy game I done in a pandemic that Matt did.

35
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:43,251
And here's what we're going to be doing today.

36
00:01:44,315 --> 00:01:47,584
Right, so we're not going to read all this slide here, but

37
00:01:47,584 --> 00:01:49,831
we will tell you we're going to start out with our origin

38
00:01:49,831 --> 00:01:52,117
stories, which of course are the most interesting part of

39
00:01:52,117 --> 00:01:52,498
any story.

40
00:01:54,145 --> 00:01:57,286
And then the rest of the cliched titles that you see up above.

41
00:01:57,286 --> 00:02:00,188
So, all right, a little background on us.

42
00:02:00,188 --> 00:02:01,928
Here's our origin stories.

43
00:02:01,928 --> 00:02:02,789
So I'm Matt Leacock.

44
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,990
I'm a former user experience designer.

45
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:08,031
I've been a designer of one type or another for most of my

46
00:02:08,031 --> 00:02:08,771
professional career.

47
00:02:08,771 --> 00:02:12,993
I worked in the Bay Area for about 16 years in Bay Area

48
00:02:12,993 --> 00:02:15,014
companies like Yahoo and AOL, Netscape.

49
00:02:15,695 --> 00:02:18,479
About two and a half years ago, I left that.

50
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:20,642
I left high tech full time to go full time

51
00:02:20,642 --> 00:02:23,226
into board game design, and these are some of the games

52
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:25,009
that I've designed in the meantime.

53
00:02:25,707 --> 00:02:28,930
That's largely due to the success of Pandemic.

54
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:32,273
So I know you raised your hands for Pandemic Legacy, but

55
00:02:32,273 --> 00:02:35,395
how many of you played Pandemic, the base game?

56
00:02:35,395 --> 00:02:35,916
OK, great.

57
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:38,938
So I'm not going to explain to you how this game works.

58
00:02:38,938 --> 00:02:40,860
It's a cooperative game.

59
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,983
You fight disease and so on.

60
00:02:43,983 --> 00:02:45,444
Yeah, I won't belabor that point too much.

61
00:02:45,444 --> 00:02:46,985
And that never gets old, by the way.

62
00:02:46,985 --> 00:02:48,507
I just love seeing that.

63
00:02:48,507 --> 00:02:52,010
That's how you get to leave your job and do it full time.

64
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:52,930
Yeah.

65
00:02:53,837 --> 00:02:58,384
I'm Rob Davio. I have been a professional board game designer since 1998,

66
00:02:58,384 --> 00:03:02,730
when I tumbled into a job at Hasbro Parker Brothers Milton Bradley,

67
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:08,879
just in time to do all these great games for Star Wars Episode I.

68
00:03:15,113 --> 00:03:21,596
Part of my job in May 1999 was going to go see The Phantom Menace with a notebook so I could write trivial pursuit questions.

69
00:03:21,596 --> 00:03:28,079
And let me tell you, after seeing that five days in a row, the excitement of seeing Star Wars for work really wore off.

70
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:33,402
These are some of the games that I have done over the years.

71
00:03:33,402 --> 00:03:38,124
I've done a lot of Risk games, did work on Betrayal at House on the Hill that I'm happy with.

72
00:03:38,124 --> 00:03:41,346
There's other games on there, kids games and things that I haven't done.

73
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,946
I've done about 80 games maybe.

74
00:03:43,754 --> 00:03:44,575
that have been published.

75
00:03:44,575 --> 00:03:45,736
But in 2011, I did a game called Risk Legacy.

76
00:03:45,736 --> 00:03:47,318
Who has played Risk Legacy here?

77
00:03:47,318 --> 00:03:47,538
OK.

78
00:03:47,538 --> 00:03:49,000
Some?

79
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,743
So I'll just give a little brief thing.

80
00:03:51,743 --> 00:03:55,307
The whole point of a legacy game is that,

81
00:03:55,307 --> 00:03:58,370
and I'm giving a whole talk tomorrow

82
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,212
to do a deep dive of legacy games in general,

83
00:04:00,212 --> 00:04:01,473
but top level here is.

84
00:04:02,214 --> 00:04:05,216
Two parts, some of the actions you take in one game

85
00:04:05,216 --> 00:04:07,077
permanently carry over to future games.

86
00:04:07,077 --> 00:04:09,479
So everyone's game starts out in the same place

87
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:10,960
and then heads in a different direction.

88
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,622
This involves stickers, this involves markers,

89
00:04:13,622 --> 00:04:16,604
this involves the dramatic ripping up of cards,

90
00:04:16,604 --> 00:04:19,566
which is done infrequently, but the thing everyone knows

91
00:04:19,566 --> 00:04:20,927
because it's such a social taboo.

92
00:04:21,487 --> 00:04:23,709
And the second part, as you can see from the envelopes

93
00:04:23,709 --> 00:04:26,151
that are on the inside of that box up there,

94
00:04:26,151 --> 00:04:27,973
new content is delivered when you play.

95
00:04:27,973 --> 00:04:29,494
It's like having expansions in the box,

96
00:04:29,494 --> 00:04:30,675
but instead of just opening it

97
00:04:30,675 --> 00:04:32,757
whenever you open it narratively

98
00:04:32,757 --> 00:04:34,579
for either achieving something.

99
00:04:34,579 --> 00:04:39,343
So I had done this and Matt had done Pandemic.

100
00:04:39,343 --> 00:04:43,967
And then in 2013, he got in touch with me

101
00:04:43,967 --> 00:04:45,968
and asked if we wanted to do Pandemic Legacy.

102
00:04:46,606 --> 00:04:48,789
Yeah, I have been working with Z-Man to that point.

103
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,791
We were trying to figure out how to develop out Pandemic

104
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,273
into kind of a franchise.

105
00:04:52,273 --> 00:04:54,255
So we battled around a lot of ideas.

106
00:04:54,255 --> 00:04:56,958
You know, maybe we could do Pandemic a dice game.

107
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:58,720
Maybe we could do Pandemic the card game.

108
00:04:59,877 --> 00:05:03,019
And then we said, hey, how about Panamec the Legacy game?

109
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:06,702
And we just kind of laughed.

110
00:05:06,702 --> 00:05:08,183
I was really intimidated by the idea.

111
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:10,064
I'm not sure if it was because I was working full time

112
00:05:10,064 --> 00:05:12,786
or the whole idea of a Panamec Legacy

113
00:05:12,786 --> 00:05:15,068
was just too overwhelming or intimidating,

114
00:05:15,068 --> 00:05:17,930
but I never really seriously considered it at all

115
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:20,592
until maybe, I don't know, six months later,

116
00:05:20,592 --> 00:05:21,913
I was sketching in a notebook

117
00:05:21,913 --> 00:05:25,135
and jotting down different ideas for twists and turns

118
00:05:25,135 --> 00:05:26,616
and how something like that might work.

119
00:05:27,798 --> 00:05:28,999
And I was just hooked.

120
00:05:28,999 --> 00:05:32,521
I needed to go a little bit below the surface

121
00:05:32,521 --> 00:05:35,183
and proceeded to try to figure out

122
00:05:35,183 --> 00:05:37,744
how to talk to Mr. Daviau here

123
00:05:37,744 --> 00:05:42,748
and managed to get his contact information through Z-Man

124
00:05:42,748 --> 00:05:44,729
and send him a quick note.

125
00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:47,371
Rob, you might want to mention where you're at at the time.

126
00:05:47,371 --> 00:05:50,092
So I sent you this note and basically saying,

127
00:05:50,092 --> 00:05:51,613
hey, what do you think, pandemic legacy?

128
00:05:51,613 --> 00:05:53,374
Is that gonna work for you?

129
00:05:53,977 --> 00:06:02,842
Yeah, and I wrote back yes in like a hundred point type because I just started my own company and was looking for any sort of work.

130
00:06:02,842 --> 00:06:03,983
Luckily, I said yes to this one.

131
00:06:03,983 --> 00:06:07,285
Yeah, we've been working together ever since on Legacy Games.

132
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:11,921
No, and I and we had a lot of a lot of questions a lot of design questions

133
00:06:11,921 --> 00:06:17,764
We're getting basically take you through over the next half hour or so half hour 40 minutes

134
00:06:17,764 --> 00:06:21,625
Why did we made the decisions we did?

135
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:26,387
What worked which luckily was most of it? What didn't work? There were a few things that didn't

136
00:06:27,002 --> 00:06:33,185
And some of the learnings that we had about how to make this project this big in the board game space.

137
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:42,010
But really when we sat down in September of 2013 and then when we did it again two years later to start season two, it's pretty much that.

138
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:48,274
It's a lot of unknowns. We both made board games.

139
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:53,457
And so we basically kind of just sat down and said like, well, what are some key things that make a legacy game?

140
00:06:53,457 --> 00:06:56,058
Because at that point, there have been exactly one.

141
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,482
And so we sort of pulled it apart

142
00:06:59,482 --> 00:07:00,823
and we realized that there were,

143
00:07:00,823 --> 00:07:03,586
there are two things that make a good fit

144
00:07:03,586 --> 00:07:06,608
to turn a traditional board game into a legacy game.

145
00:07:06,608 --> 00:07:11,333
And those are this, a simple core engine,

146
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:11,813
pandemic.

147
00:07:12,909 --> 00:07:18,372
It's a great game and it actually has a relatively simple core of rules.

148
00:07:18,372 --> 00:07:21,493
A lot of people play it who don't play a lot of games.

149
00:07:21,493 --> 00:07:24,195
It's cooperative, so you can help each other if someone doesn't get the rules.

150
00:07:24,195 --> 00:07:28,577
And as Matt's done a number of expansions that shows that you can build and stretch

151
00:07:28,577 --> 00:07:32,499
and move it in different directions, which means as we designed a legacy game

152
00:07:32,499 --> 00:07:37,581
and if it starts with basically pandemic, we can move it to go to different places

153
00:07:37,581 --> 00:07:40,042
with rules we knew that would work.

154
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:42,283
And it also has a robust theme, which is more.

155
00:07:43,209 --> 00:07:46,713
my thing, which is, OK, it's a world and there's diseases and everything's going

156
00:07:46,713 --> 00:07:47,013
wrong.

157
00:07:47,013 --> 00:07:47,694
Cool, I get that.

158
00:07:47,694 --> 00:07:49,295
Everyone's going to get that.

159
00:07:49,295 --> 00:07:52,899
It sounds like a fun way to torture players as you go through this experience.

160
00:07:52,899 --> 00:07:56,442
It wasn't like trying to make a Legacy game out of Bridge or something or Uno.

161
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:58,084
There's a world there.

162
00:07:58,084 --> 00:07:59,965
There's a good underpinning for a story.

163
00:07:59,965 --> 00:08:01,967
So that's the first thing.

164
00:08:01,967 --> 00:08:05,351
Like if for a Legacy game it's like it needs to start out relatively simple and then

165
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:09,196
build on top of it, and have a story that builds on top.

166
00:08:09,196 --> 00:08:10,057
And if you go back and forth,

167
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:13,521
because when we design, we will get stuck on the rules

168
00:08:13,521 --> 00:08:15,124
and the mechanisms, and then we'll figure out

169
00:08:15,124 --> 00:08:16,986
what the story is, or we'll figure out the story,

170
00:08:16,986 --> 00:08:18,989
and then get stuck, and then go back and forth.

171
00:08:18,989 --> 00:08:19,910
And really, when we design,

172
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,692
there's a lot of back and forth between the two.

173
00:08:23,114 --> 00:08:27,076
So with Mr. Risk Roll a Lot of Dice,

174
00:08:27,076 --> 00:08:29,337
Star Wars Trivial Pursuit Storyteller,

175
00:08:29,337 --> 00:08:33,119
and Clean Euro Guy, we were hoping for this combination.

176
00:08:33,119 --> 00:08:36,301
Smooth chocolate and peanut butter.

177
00:08:36,301 --> 00:08:37,041
Delicious, right?

178
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:38,882
There was a very big fear

179
00:08:38,882 --> 00:08:42,704
that we were gonna end up with that.

180
00:08:42,704 --> 00:08:44,125
I just love how that glistens.

181
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,405
I have no idea.

182
00:08:45,405 --> 00:08:47,226
Please get that slide off.

183
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:49,408
Matt has weirded out every time we practice.

184
00:08:49,408 --> 00:08:49,628
Okay.

185
00:08:50,804 --> 00:08:51,284
First question.

186
00:08:51,284 --> 00:08:51,664
Yeah.

187
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:53,585
So I mean, the big question is, how do we do that?

188
00:08:53,585 --> 00:08:56,626
How do we string 20 games in a row and make

189
00:08:56,626 --> 00:08:59,127
them kind of work together?

190
00:08:59,127 --> 00:09:00,908
There were a lot of unanswered questions about

191
00:09:00,908 --> 00:09:01,468
how to structure it.

192
00:09:01,468 --> 00:09:05,350
No one had done a cooperative legacy game before.

193
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,090
And so we looked at a number of different options.

194
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:09,091
This first option.

195
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:11,772
Well, the first option is doing what I did in Risk Legacy.

196
00:09:11,772 --> 00:09:14,133
So in Risk Legacy, players play games.

197
00:09:14,133 --> 00:09:16,634
And there's a number of envelopes with

198
00:09:16,634 --> 00:09:17,314
triggers on them.

199
00:09:17,997 --> 00:09:19,518
in the sense of it tells you when to open it.

200
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:21,660
And if you remember from the box or if you played,

201
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,202
it opens up and the box stays open like a pizza lid open

202
00:09:24,202 --> 00:09:26,343
because that's supposed to remind you

203
00:09:26,343 --> 00:09:27,624
of things that are available.

204
00:09:27,624 --> 00:09:28,185
So if you're.

205
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:32,927
like playing and then you see it you're like I want to go for that.

206
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:36,188
I get into this in detail tomorrow I really underestimated what a draw that

207
00:09:36,188 --> 00:09:40,909
was I was just like taunting them with Christmas presents right to to go for.

208
00:09:40,909 --> 00:09:44,109
But what you end up with is you end up something where you have the players in

209
00:09:44,109 --> 00:09:49,011
the middle in control and then each blue circle represents like a new story bit a

210
00:09:49,011 --> 00:09:52,391
new twist or turn where new rules are brought in and sometimes you have to go

211
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:55,212
through a darker circle to get to the lighter circle and then when you're done

212
00:09:55,212 --> 00:09:58,053
there's kind of like just an ending off to the side like oh hey you've opened

213
00:09:58,053 --> 00:09:58,833
everything it's done.

214
00:09:59,853 --> 00:10:03,676
And that worked in Risk, but Risk Legacy is very sandbox play.

215
00:10:03,676 --> 00:10:06,577
It's very tongue-in-cheek almost.

216
00:10:06,577 --> 00:10:09,999
I mean, it's like a comic book tropey stuff in there.

217
00:10:09,999 --> 00:10:11,841
Like, you shouldn't play it and feel like, wow,

218
00:10:11,841 --> 00:10:14,042
that's a really tightly written story.

219
00:10:14,042 --> 00:10:16,583
It's not. Like, it was more trying to figure out how

220
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:19,085
to make the legacy idea work.

221
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:22,047
So, we thought with this that that could work,

222
00:10:22,047 --> 00:10:22,907
and that was one option.

223
00:10:22,907 --> 00:10:24,868
But after talking about it for a while, we wanted something

224
00:10:24,868 --> 00:10:26,049
that was a little bit more.

225
00:10:27,403 --> 00:10:31,226
like linear, like where one thing leads to another in a more logical story path.

226
00:10:32,378 --> 00:10:35,199
Right, so one of the things we explored was branching.

227
00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:38,181
We have a story path where certain players would branch

228
00:10:38,181 --> 00:10:41,243
off into one fork, and other players would branch off into

229
00:10:41,243 --> 00:10:42,503
another fork.

230
00:10:42,503 --> 00:10:43,744
And we kept running into problems.

231
00:10:43,744 --> 00:10:45,565
This is probably no surprise to a lot of you.

232
00:10:45,565 --> 00:10:48,307
I mean, that first branch, for example, if you hit that and

233
00:10:48,307 --> 00:10:50,888
you end early, you feel like you've broken your game.

234
00:10:50,888 --> 00:10:52,949
You've only gotten half the value out of it.

235
00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:55,410
And then us as content providers, as we're writing

236
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:59,352
all this stuff, the thought that a huge percentage of the

237
00:10:59,352 --> 00:11:01,654
game is not going to be seen by a lot of the people.

238
00:11:02,394 --> 00:11:06,717
And a lot of the packages would go unopened, didn't quite resonate well.

239
00:11:06,717 --> 00:11:09,798
And we were having difficulty coming up with a story.

240
00:11:09,798 --> 00:11:12,320
And the complexity of the product was kind of overwhelming.

241
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,181
So we abandoned this one pretty early.

242
00:11:15,181 --> 00:11:20,184
Yeah, and then we stumbled upon what we thought was a pretty clever way of telling a story.

243
00:11:20,184 --> 00:11:20,844
And we—it's that.

244
00:11:20,844 --> 00:11:21,085
Yeah.

245
00:11:21,085 --> 00:11:23,526
And that had a lot of promise in it.

246
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:30,954
And we felt we could do something with that model.

247
00:11:30,954 --> 00:11:32,956
I don't know if anyone's tried that before.

248
00:11:32,956 --> 00:11:33,537
Yeah.

249
00:11:33,537 --> 00:11:35,179
By doing that, there's a lot of concern.

250
00:11:36,121 --> 00:11:38,363
with these legacy games of it being consumable,

251
00:11:38,363 --> 00:11:40,924
of it ending, of not seeing all the content,

252
00:11:40,924 --> 00:11:42,545
of getting your money's worth.

253
00:11:42,545 --> 00:11:45,627
And so by getting away from branching and by doing this,

254
00:11:45,627 --> 00:11:48,890
we could allow people to see almost all of the content,

255
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:50,090
but in slightly different ways.

256
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:52,232
So group A might make certain decisions

257
00:11:52,232 --> 00:11:54,553
that let them deviate from the path,

258
00:11:54,553 --> 00:11:55,894
and then we kind of pull them back,

259
00:11:55,894 --> 00:11:56,815
and it goes back and forth.

260
00:11:56,815 --> 00:11:58,916
So it's one continual road where you take

261
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:00,797
this little meandering journey through it,

262
00:12:00,797 --> 00:12:01,698
and then group two.

263
00:12:02,819 --> 00:12:08,721
you know, would do that. So at the end when they talked about their experiences, they all basically had the same experience

264
00:12:08,721 --> 00:12:10,221
but made different choices along the way.

265
00:12:10,221 --> 00:12:16,643
So it felt a little different and that gave us a lot of narrative control to try to tell a story and also to figure

266
00:12:16,643 --> 00:12:19,304
out when we were building rules,

267
00:12:19,304 --> 00:12:26,346
okay, like A happens and then B happens and then C happens and but you know, there might be gaps in between

268
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:30,528
but it let us have more control when building it. And that turned into

269
00:12:31,357 --> 00:12:33,639
Yeah, the trick then was trying to figure out how to

270
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:34,819
actually enroll that in the game.

271
00:12:34,819 --> 00:12:37,181
How do you do that when typically you take the game

272
00:12:37,181 --> 00:12:39,182
off the shelf, you play it, and then you put it back on

273
00:12:39,182 --> 00:12:41,404
the shelf, and the next time you take it out again, it's

274
00:12:41,404 --> 00:12:42,344
the same game.

275
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:43,945
How do we unveil this new material?

276
00:12:43,945 --> 00:12:47,547
And we came up with this concept of a legacy deck.

277
00:12:48,508 --> 00:12:50,809
which basically you go through from top to bottom.

278
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:54,210
You start on this big stop card, which is inspired by the SAT test,

279
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,051
you know, put your pencils down.

280
00:12:56,051 --> 00:12:59,872
And then you just flip through the cards one at a time

281
00:12:59,872 --> 00:13:03,813
and we could gradually unveil new rules and new characters

282
00:13:03,813 --> 00:13:06,394
and so on and other surprises as the game progressed forward.

283
00:13:06,394 --> 00:13:09,055
Yeah, it also leads to the very fun rule in the rule book saying

284
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:10,036
if you drop it on the floor.

285
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:15,965
Get someone who's not playing the game to put it back together in order which might be the first time that's been written in

286
00:13:15,965 --> 00:13:18,627
a board game rulebook

287
00:13:18,627 --> 00:13:21,549
So we had that and we're like, okay that that's gonna work

288
00:13:21,549 --> 00:13:26,453
That's gonna deliver things in the order that we want them to but how many games how many games?

289
00:13:26,453 --> 00:13:29,195
Do people want to commit to and this is an interesting sort of

290
00:13:29,195 --> 00:13:30,577
like

291
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:36,662
Product proposition question rather than a game design question. It's like if we give you a hundred one-hour games boy

292
00:13:36,662 --> 00:13:39,164
We're promising a lot of content and no one will finish

293
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,585
Like, it just will wear out its welcome.

294
00:13:41,585 --> 00:13:44,608
If we give you six amazing games,

295
00:13:44,608 --> 00:13:46,149
many people will finish and then complain

296
00:13:46,149 --> 00:13:47,410
that they weren't enough.

297
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,072
So there was a big question.

298
00:13:49,072 --> 00:13:50,032
When I had done Risk Legacy,

299
00:13:50,032 --> 00:13:53,095
I had just randomly picked 15 games.

300
00:13:53,095 --> 00:13:54,817
Well, not randomly, I gave it some thought.

301
00:13:54,817 --> 00:13:56,278
That turned out to be a pretty good number.

302
00:13:57,058 --> 00:13:59,079
It's enough that you feel like it's money's worth,

303
00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:01,200
but not so much that you can't get people back together.

304
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,181
And so we started talking about 12 to 15.

305
00:14:04,181 --> 00:14:06,582
Yeah, 15 seemed like a little too much to me.

306
00:14:06,582 --> 00:14:11,104
Although that's what actually 15 is pretty much where

307
00:14:11,104 --> 00:14:12,204
it netted out at the end.

308
00:14:12,204 --> 00:14:14,145
But we were like, how about 12, which

309
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:17,906
led to the other cunning idea that 12 is a number that you

310
00:14:17,906 --> 00:14:19,087
can put on a timeline.

311
00:14:19,087 --> 00:14:19,647
So we added the.

312
00:14:23,283 --> 00:14:25,003
basically divided it into months.

313
00:14:25,003 --> 00:14:26,644
And then we thought, okay, there's a lot of things

314
00:14:26,644 --> 00:14:27,744
you're not gonna know in this game.

315
00:14:27,744 --> 00:14:29,964
There's a lot of things that are uncertain,

316
00:14:29,964 --> 00:14:33,205
but you're going to know that February comes after January.

317
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,825
And you're gonna know that you're going to play

318
00:14:34,825 --> 00:14:37,586
till December, so you have this comforting feeling

319
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:40,707
of there are going to be 12 experiences in the game.

320
00:14:40,707 --> 00:14:42,007
They logically follow each other,

321
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:44,128
and it's not like you get to game eight

322
00:14:44,128 --> 00:14:44,968
and we say, okay, now it's over.

323
00:14:45,428 --> 00:14:49,389
right, you know when it ends from the very beginning and that gives you a little bit of

324
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:53,611
peace of mind because one of the things that we like to do is not give you peace of mind while

325
00:14:53,611 --> 00:15:01,494
you're playing this and so we had to make sure there were certain areas where you knew that like

326
00:15:01,494 --> 00:15:03,095
you knew what was happening like you had a lay of the land.

327
00:15:03,095 --> 00:15:09,297
So one of the tricks then is how do you balance this? One of the things with Risk Legacy is it's

328
00:15:09,297 --> 00:15:14,139
a competitive game so if one player starts to get far ahead the other players can kind of serve as

329
00:15:14,139 --> 00:15:14,579
a check.

330
00:15:15,258 --> 00:15:18,699
We were doing a cooperative game that changed over time.

331
00:15:18,699 --> 00:15:22,601
And so the big fear that I had was that players would start

332
00:15:22,601 --> 00:15:26,342
to lose, and then because they lost and the world got worse,

333
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,443
they would continue to lose at a faster rate.

334
00:15:28,443 --> 00:15:30,023
You'd get this positive feedback loop, and things

335
00:15:30,023 --> 00:15:30,884
would spiral out of control.

336
00:15:30,884 --> 00:15:33,085
And then you'd throw the game out because

337
00:15:33,085 --> 00:15:34,785
you're so frustrated.

338
00:15:34,785 --> 00:15:37,666
So we needed to figure out ways to put negative feedback

339
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:38,707
loops into the game.

340
00:15:38,707 --> 00:15:42,568
And the first one we worked on was

341
00:15:42,968 --> 00:15:45,529
One that plays off of these event cards.

342
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:47,990
Pandemic and Pandemic Legacy ship with event cards.

343
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:50,751
And they're these special superpower cards you can play

344
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:52,432
out of phase.

345
00:15:52,432 --> 00:15:54,673
And they're good for two reasons.

346
00:15:54,673 --> 00:15:56,153
One, they give you a special power.

347
00:15:56,153 --> 00:15:58,714
And the second thing is they kind of pad out the player

348
00:15:58,714 --> 00:16:00,195
deck, which is the clock for the game.

349
00:16:00,195 --> 00:16:02,576
And when the deck runs out, you lose the game.

350
00:16:02,576 --> 00:16:03,616
So these are pretty valuable.

351
00:16:04,457 --> 00:16:06,439
So we start the players off with a certain number of them.

352
00:16:06,439 --> 00:16:11,365
And we decided that if players continue to win, we can pull

353
00:16:11,365 --> 00:16:14,449
some of those back, basically give them a handicap.

354
00:16:14,449 --> 00:16:17,873
And if they lose, we can give them more.

355
00:16:17,873 --> 00:16:19,895
And we needed to come up with some sort of rationalization

356
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:20,916
or story reason for this.

357
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:23,239
And so we came up with the notion of funding.

358
00:16:23,239 --> 00:16:24,601
Basically, if you win a game.

359
00:16:26,297 --> 00:16:29,118
The powers that be determine, of course, that you're doing

360
00:16:29,118 --> 00:16:32,159
so well that we're going to cut back your funding and you

361
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:34,180
get fewer cards.

362
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:37,741
But if you lose a game, this stuff needs to be contained,

363
00:16:37,741 --> 00:16:39,022
and you get more budget.

364
00:16:39,022 --> 00:16:44,104
So kind of a tongue-in-cheek way of basically modifying the

365
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:46,344
number of cards you get up and down.

366
00:16:46,344 --> 00:16:48,905
Here's an example of a game calendar of people keeping

367
00:16:48,905 --> 00:16:49,586
track of.

368
00:16:50,682 --> 00:16:57,143
game after game and getting more cards as a result of losing or fewer as a result of winning.

369
00:16:57,143 --> 00:17:01,503
What's funny is that actually came out of a playtest.

370
00:17:01,503 --> 00:17:06,024
You can sit and we can talk to each other all day long and then you get into a playtest

371
00:17:06,024 --> 00:17:09,725
and you come up with the idea that you never would have had playtesting.

372
00:17:09,725 --> 00:17:12,765
And this was just an attempt to make my friends feel less bad.

373
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:16,546
They were playtesting and then they lost the game and they're like,

374
00:17:16,546 --> 00:17:19,206
Oh, that's horrible. We were about to win and we lost.

375
00:17:20,534 --> 00:17:22,916
you have more event cards, you have more funding.

376
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:23,777
Play again, please.

377
00:17:23,777 --> 00:17:25,399
And they were like, that sounds great.

378
00:17:25,399 --> 00:17:27,201
Consolation prize, yeah.

379
00:17:27,201 --> 00:17:28,262
And then I get on my phone with Matt,

380
00:17:28,262 --> 00:17:30,305
I'm like, okay, I think this worked.

381
00:17:30,305 --> 00:17:32,107
Hold on, we just did something.

382
00:17:33,234 --> 00:17:34,455
So that's work.

383
00:17:34,455 --> 00:17:38,799
That became one of our main ways to keep everyone in the middle.

384
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,682
And the hope was that, you know, one group like this might be

385
00:17:42,682 --> 00:17:43,722
between 0, 2, 4, and 6.

386
00:17:43,722 --> 00:17:46,164
And then another group that wasn't as good might float

387
00:17:46,164 --> 00:17:48,026
between like 6, 8, and 10, right?

388
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:50,268
That both of them are going up and down

389
00:17:50,268 --> 00:17:51,268
within their comfort zone.

390
00:17:51,268 --> 00:17:53,350
But they have two different comfort zones, so it scales

391
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:56,673
for different levels of play groups.

392
00:17:57,608 --> 00:18:00,730
Another thing we learned, though, is that if you play

393
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:03,312
January and you lose, and then you play February and you lose,

394
00:18:03,312 --> 00:18:06,934
and you play March and you lose, you might feel like

395
00:18:06,934 --> 00:18:10,617
you're being dragged through the entire timeline, that you

396
00:18:10,617 --> 00:18:11,318
can't really catch up.

397
00:18:11,318 --> 00:18:14,400
You can't take advantage of what you've learned again.

398
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,102
So we actually broke each month into two pieces.

399
00:18:17,102 --> 00:18:19,583
So if you win the game, you move on to the next month.

400
00:18:20,884 --> 00:18:24,205
However, if you lose it, you get one more chance to play it again.

401
00:18:24,205 --> 00:18:28,987
You can take advantage of all the learnings that you got through your mistakes.

402
00:18:28,987 --> 00:18:35,149
So you've got this sort of like two-part month system, as it were, and that worked fairly

403
00:18:35,149 --> 00:18:35,829
well.

404
00:18:35,829 --> 00:18:39,630
If you lost, you got a consolation prize, you get additional funding, and you get one

405
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:40,811
more shot before moving on.

406
00:18:40,811 --> 00:18:42,731
We didn't want to keep doing that, though.

407
00:18:42,731 --> 00:18:46,152
If you kept losing and keep playing January over and over again, the game would quickly

408
00:18:46,152 --> 00:18:50,053
become a grind and people would get really worn out and want to leave it on the shelf.

409
00:18:50,752 --> 00:18:57,075
There was also the risk that because your funding goes up when you lose, and because

410
00:18:57,075 --> 00:19:00,997
at the end of every game you get these two sort of permanent stickers or goodies that

411
00:19:00,997 --> 00:19:05,940
make it easier, that we had to be really aware that it wasn't like, let's just tank six months

412
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:09,121
in a row and then become superheroes and then we can win.

413
00:19:09,897 --> 00:19:13,158
like the back half of things so now that we've solved like

414
00:19:13,158 --> 00:19:16,459
losing is okay and it's not going to lead to more losing with funding and

415
00:19:16,459 --> 00:19:17,099
also

416
00:19:17,099 --> 00:19:20,980
letting you repeat a month gives you a chance to like do better and maybe

417
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,501
get some more goodies because you played another game

418
00:19:23,501 --> 00:19:26,361
we were in a position where maybe we had gone too far the other way

419
00:19:26,361 --> 00:19:28,802
and now we weren't encouraging you to win

420
00:19:28,802 --> 00:19:30,042
so that led to

421
00:19:30,042 --> 00:19:32,663
these cards

422
00:19:32,663 --> 00:19:36,144
yes it is when bonus cards essentially uh... positive incentives for winning

423
00:19:37,572 --> 00:19:40,353
You shouldn't have to tell players that you should want to win.

424
00:19:40,353 --> 00:19:41,774
But they're gamers, right?

425
00:19:41,774 --> 00:19:44,074
They're going to look at it and go, hey, it's better to lose a few games in a row,

426
00:19:44,074 --> 00:19:45,555
because then our funding will go up.

427
00:19:45,555 --> 00:19:46,915
We'll get more event cards.

428
00:19:46,915 --> 00:19:49,056
So we give them this carrot.

429
00:19:49,056 --> 00:19:52,157
But then we quickly realized, well, if we tell them what the win bonus is,

430
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:54,458
they're going to min-max and go, oh, OK.

431
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:54,998
Well.

432
00:19:55,378 --> 00:19:58,140
This bonus is not quite as good as the two event cards, so I

433
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,341
think we should still lose.

434
00:19:59,341 --> 00:20:01,302
And then you feel bad, because you're kind of playing against

435
00:20:01,302 --> 00:20:02,923
what the game's intent is.

436
00:20:02,923 --> 00:20:06,226
So we solved that by putting a scratch material over it.

437
00:20:06,226 --> 00:20:08,727
So now you really want to win, because you don't know what

438
00:20:08,727 --> 00:20:10,609
you're going to miss if you don't.

439
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:13,250
And so that was our hidden carrot.

440
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,891
Yep, it's the fear of missing out.

441
00:20:14,891 --> 00:20:17,413
If you lose, and you don't get to see it, and you rip it up,

442
00:20:17,413 --> 00:20:19,815
and it goes away, and you never knew what happened, and

443
00:20:19,815 --> 00:20:23,137
that's a really powerful incentive in legacy games, is

444
00:20:23,137 --> 00:20:24,578
well, but I want to see what it is.

445
00:20:26,105 --> 00:20:29,389
And so, yeah, and they're all a little different,

446
00:20:29,389 --> 00:20:30,931
and they all can't be so good that, again,

447
00:20:30,931 --> 00:20:32,613
it leads to winning leading to more winning,

448
00:20:32,613 --> 00:20:34,095
but it has to be good enough that you felt

449
00:20:34,095 --> 00:20:35,758
like you earned it when you scratched it off.

450
00:20:35,758 --> 00:20:38,261
It's a lot of psychology that we discovered in this,

451
00:20:38,261 --> 00:20:40,124
and we're gonna get into that, you know,

452
00:20:40,124 --> 00:20:41,405
not in this next section, but the-

453
00:20:41,405 --> 00:20:42,266
Second half of the talk, yeah?

454
00:20:42,266 --> 00:20:43,128
Yeah, second half of the talk.

455
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:47,677
So now we had some of our sort of mechanisms in place.

456
00:20:47,677 --> 00:20:48,877
It was going to be 12 to 24 games.

457
00:20:48,877 --> 00:20:50,538
It was going to be an average of about 18.

458
00:20:50,538 --> 00:20:52,739
And it turns out it's 15 to 18 games,

459
00:20:52,739 --> 00:20:55,600
that you win more often than you lose.

460
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,600
It's not a 50-50 win ratio.

461
00:20:57,414 --> 00:20:59,395
So you end up repeating a couple months.

462
00:20:59,395 --> 00:21:00,875
And if you lose both parts of a month,

463
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,116
which happens to people,

464
00:21:02,116 --> 00:21:04,136
it feels like a particular low point

465
00:21:04,136 --> 00:21:06,557
or a downbeat as we'll get to in a second.

466
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:08,138
So now we had to go flip over to the other side

467
00:21:08,138 --> 00:21:09,738
we talked about, which is,

468
00:21:09,738 --> 00:21:11,479
well, how do we tell a story with it?

469
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:13,599
So we can just keep throwing like cards

470
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:16,540
and numbers and math and actions at you.

471
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:19,561
But ultimately we want to tell a story.

472
00:21:19,561 --> 00:21:21,722
And when we were going back to prepare this,

473
00:21:21,722 --> 00:21:23,623
we went and realized out of the entire game,

474
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:28,965
The entire plot of the game is told in 23 cards,

475
00:21:28,965 --> 00:21:30,926
some of which aren't even filled.

476
00:21:30,926 --> 00:21:33,247
So we had to basically find a way

477
00:21:33,247 --> 00:21:36,589
to make a lot of things familiar

478
00:21:36,589 --> 00:21:38,610
so that the story was something

479
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:39,690
that just kind of filled in the blanks.

480
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:42,551
Like here's the next thing you go, of course, right?

481
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:43,632
Of course that happened.

482
00:21:43,632 --> 00:21:47,554
Of course that character shows up right now.

483
00:21:47,554 --> 00:21:51,716
And that relies on some using a lot of familiarity

484
00:21:51,716 --> 00:21:52,896
with genres.

485
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:56,005
And so we sat down and this movie was out

486
00:21:56,005 --> 00:21:57,653
around the time we were working on it.

487
00:21:59,373 --> 00:22:00,874
And we're like, yeah, that's kind of it.

488
00:22:00,874 --> 00:22:05,156
It's kind of like a 70s movie, but redone into a modern movie.

489
00:22:05,156 --> 00:22:07,298
And it's an action thriller.

490
00:22:07,298 --> 00:22:08,498
And it's got a little bit of, you know,

491
00:22:08,498 --> 00:22:09,999
it's got some action scenes and a little bit

492
00:22:09,999 --> 00:22:11,240
of character building.

493
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:14,922
And then that led to our other huge insight,

494
00:22:14,922 --> 00:22:17,904
which is movies have three acts.

495
00:22:17,904 --> 00:22:19,605
Now I know we're blowing your mind with this timeline

496
00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:21,947
and this three act structure, but stay with us.

497
00:22:21,947 --> 00:22:22,747
It'll make sense.

498
00:22:22,747 --> 00:22:24,988
First the linear plot, now the three act structure, yeah.

499
00:22:28,461 --> 00:22:30,503
So we're kind of like, wow, we can really just kind of,

500
00:22:30,503 --> 00:22:33,167
kind of literally craft this into three acts.

501
00:22:33,167 --> 00:22:33,848
Act one, you do this.

502
00:22:33,848 --> 00:22:34,568
Act two, you do this.

503
00:22:34,568 --> 00:22:35,950
Act three, you do this.

504
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:38,213
Neither of us have ever studied screenwriting.

505
00:22:39,174 --> 00:22:41,515
So what we're about to say may be horribly wrong

506
00:22:41,515 --> 00:22:42,756
if you have said it.

507
00:22:42,756 --> 00:22:43,817
Or terribly obvious.

508
00:22:43,817 --> 00:22:44,417
Or terribly obvious.

509
00:22:44,417 --> 00:22:45,158
Like it's one of the two.

510
00:22:45,158 --> 00:22:47,640
But we basically, we read some books,

511
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,301
and we kind of thought about it.

512
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:50,842
And it did a little bit of light research.

513
00:22:50,842 --> 00:22:52,824
And so we kind of said, wow, we've got act one, act two,

514
00:22:52,824 --> 00:22:53,884
act three.

515
00:22:53,884 --> 00:22:57,127
And then we had both read a book.

516
00:22:57,127 --> 00:22:57,647
I'll let you talk.

517
00:22:57,647 --> 00:22:58,328
Yeah, yeah.

518
00:22:58,328 --> 00:23:00,749
Well, I had read Hamlet's Hit Points by Robin Laws.

519
00:23:00,749 --> 00:23:03,532
And he goes into great detail about beats,

520
00:23:03,532 --> 00:23:07,695
these moments that provide moments of uplift or down.

521
00:23:08,102 --> 00:23:08,882
uh... down left uh...

522
00:23:08,882 --> 00:23:12,446
uh... that modulate uh... people's emotions uh...

523
00:23:12,446 --> 00:23:14,188
sir like this the moment by moment uh...

524
00:23:15,726 --> 00:23:19,589
how a game, how a screenplay, how music, how any of these

525
00:23:19,589 --> 00:23:20,229
things kind of play out.

526
00:23:20,229 --> 00:23:23,992
And he came up with a whole vocabulary of these things.

527
00:23:23,992 --> 00:23:25,674
Most of them are procedural.

528
00:23:25,674 --> 00:23:29,116
An upbeat that's a procedural beat kind of moves your

529
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:32,479
protagonist toward his goal, and everybody feels better.

530
00:23:32,479 --> 00:23:34,300
But then you can also have downbeats that move the

531
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,862
protagonist away from their goal.

532
00:23:36,862 --> 00:23:39,304
There's dramatic ones, which are more of the protagonist's

533
00:23:39,304 --> 00:23:41,106
internal struggle.

534
00:23:41,106 --> 00:23:43,007
But there's other ones that are less.

535
00:23:43,808 --> 00:23:46,989
less obvious or less obvious to me like things like building anticipation

536
00:23:46,989 --> 00:23:50,631
gives you a downbeat because it creates a lot of tension in a game

537
00:23:50,631 --> 00:23:54,712
and then you have reveals which are upbeats and a lot of this stuff mapped

538
00:23:54,712 --> 00:23:57,414
really well into you know the hidden things in these

539
00:23:57,414 --> 00:23:59,514
legacy games and then the reveals that you get later

540
00:23:59,514 --> 00:24:03,616
and so we started playing with this vocabulary first at a very micro level

541
00:24:03,616 --> 00:24:05,897
looking at all the different moment by moment

542
00:24:05,897 --> 00:24:09,999
elements of a pandemic game per se so you've got things like

543
00:24:09,999 --> 00:24:13,040
hey we discovered a cure that's a that's a great upbeater everybody's happy about

544
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:13,120
that

545
00:24:13,937 --> 00:24:16,679
Or, oh, an epidemic came out, and things are getting really,

546
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:19,641
really bad, and you have a downbeat.

547
00:24:19,641 --> 00:24:24,444
You can kind of telescope out and apply these things to the

548
00:24:24,444 --> 00:24:24,844
act structure.

549
00:24:24,844 --> 00:24:25,404
Right.

550
00:24:25,404 --> 00:24:29,747
So the first thing we did is we just basically said, OK,

551
00:24:29,747 --> 00:24:31,668
things have to suck at the end of Act I and Act II.

552
00:24:31,668 --> 00:24:33,789
Basically, Luke's aunt and uncle have to die, and then

553
00:24:33,789 --> 00:24:35,991
Obi-Wan has to die.

554
00:24:35,991 --> 00:24:38,452
So we kind of basically wanted to have these moments.

555
00:24:38,452 --> 00:24:41,154
So if you have played this game, and you have played

556
00:24:41,154 --> 00:24:42,715
April and September, there you go.

557
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:49,278
I have had people come up to me at conventions who I don't know get uncomfortably close and just go September

558
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:51,501
Walk away I

559
00:24:51,501 --> 00:24:55,426
Take it really as a badge of honor

560
00:24:57,547 --> 00:24:59,749
which then means that we have to build you up

561
00:24:59,749 --> 00:25:01,170
to have an upbeat beforehand,

562
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:02,691
and then this isn't an exact mapping,

563
00:25:02,691 --> 00:25:05,254
but we spent a lot of time when we were discussing like,

564
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:06,975
well, this is kind of an upbeat or this is a downbeat,

565
00:25:06,975 --> 00:25:09,157
or we just introduced like problem, problem, problem,

566
00:25:09,157 --> 00:25:10,438
people are gonna get despondent,

567
00:25:10,438 --> 00:25:12,920
so maybe we should back up and do problem,

568
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,982
partial solution problem.

569
00:25:14,982 --> 00:25:19,867
How much do we introduce at the beginning of a game?

570
00:25:19,867 --> 00:25:21,849
How much do you introduce at the end of a game?

571
00:25:21,849 --> 00:25:23,290
Because if you finish February,

572
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:25,332
And the next thing you do is March.

573
00:25:25,332 --> 00:25:27,155
Anything that happens after February and before March

574
00:25:27,155 --> 00:25:29,698
is sort of in the same place, right?

575
00:25:29,698 --> 00:25:31,060
It's gonna happen before your next game,

576
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,442
but if you do it at the end of February,

577
00:25:32,442 --> 00:25:33,643
you're finishing up your game,

578
00:25:33,643 --> 00:25:36,908
and we give you something then, it's like a cliffhanger.

579
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,082
that you're going to live with until you decide to start March.

580
00:25:41,082 --> 00:25:44,164
And sometimes it's right away, where if we do it at the beginning of March,

581
00:25:44,164 --> 00:25:45,445
you have no time to process it.

582
00:25:45,445 --> 00:25:47,206
Like the game started, and you're sitting down to play,

583
00:25:47,206 --> 00:25:48,927
and you're like, oh, here's some new information.

584
00:25:48,927 --> 00:25:50,868
And it feels like you're off and running.

585
00:25:50,868 --> 00:25:52,729
And it's a subtle difference, but sometimes we've

586
00:25:52,729 --> 00:25:56,111
found with our playtest groups that moving them from one to the other

587
00:25:56,111 --> 00:25:58,292
provokes different upbeats or downbeats.

588
00:25:58,292 --> 00:26:00,033
Yeah, it was like taking the beats that were.

589
00:26:00,574 --> 00:26:04,300
I looked at within a game and looking at how they could be applied to the connective tissue

590
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:08,166
that kind of glued the games together and it leads to a lot of that kind of like binge

591
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:11,892
play or the page turner effect where you get to the end of the chapter and you want to

592
00:26:11,892 --> 00:26:12,593
move on to the next one.

593
00:26:14,225 --> 00:26:19,512
Which is all well and good if we were doing like a screenwriting 101 class,

594
00:26:19,512 --> 00:26:21,474
but we aren't, right?

595
00:26:21,474 --> 00:26:22,716
It's like we were talking about that,

596
00:26:22,716 --> 00:26:25,219
like about how do we get these things into a game itself?

597
00:26:25,219 --> 00:26:28,963
And many months were spent and then we, you know,

598
00:26:28,963 --> 00:26:32,227
realized pretty soon that we had an old friend.

599
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:35,092
Yeah, so how do you do this in a board game?

600
00:26:35,092 --> 00:26:37,775
We were able to leverage the legacy deck for this.

601
00:26:37,775 --> 00:26:41,659
Initially, it was just a way to parse out characters and

602
00:26:41,659 --> 00:26:43,321
other components and new rules and so on.

603
00:26:43,321 --> 00:26:48,125
But we were able to slice it in with story cards in addition

604
00:26:48,125 --> 00:26:49,927
to the other components.

605
00:26:49,927 --> 00:26:55,132
Yeah, so each game starts with, and this is going to be a

606
00:26:55,132 --> 00:26:56,053
spoiler if you haven't played.

607
00:26:56,053 --> 00:26:57,755
We're going to show you the top card of the deck.

608
00:26:59,373 --> 00:27:00,034
I apologize.

609
00:27:00,034 --> 00:27:01,396
There it is.

610
00:27:01,396 --> 00:27:03,860
These things called mission briefings,

611
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:07,364
which lets us set the tone of what you have to do.

612
00:27:07,364 --> 00:27:10,108
This is, there are 12 months, there are 12 of these,

613
00:27:10,108 --> 00:27:11,851
so it's about half of the story content

614
00:27:11,851 --> 00:27:13,653
just takes place at the beginning of each.

615
00:27:14,034 --> 00:27:19,037
each month. And we tried to pack a lot into each one of these. Right. So, you know, the first

616
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:23,100
sentence is, hey, you're a veteran, like, you know, the drill, like, we want to reward you

617
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:28,184
because you've played pandemic. So we're all like, you get this. And then we're like, you know,

618
00:27:28,184 --> 00:27:32,107
there's causing problems. We're just going to kind of frame it up here in case you're not paying

619
00:27:32,107 --> 00:27:37,371
attention. Oh, that's not so good. What's that? Some, you know, mutate faster than usual is,

620
00:27:37,371 --> 00:27:38,432
is not really that comfortable.

621
00:27:39,607 --> 00:27:41,407
And then we have someone looking into that.

622
00:27:41,407 --> 00:27:42,567
Like, I don't know what that means,

623
00:27:42,567 --> 00:27:43,807
but that might be comforting.

624
00:27:43,807 --> 00:27:45,468
It might not be comforting.

625
00:27:45,468 --> 00:27:47,008
And, but don't panic, don't panic for now.

626
00:27:47,008 --> 00:27:47,848
Keep it under control.

627
00:27:47,848 --> 00:27:49,588
You've got this and like, okay, panic a little, right?

628
00:27:49,588 --> 00:27:52,489
So one of them may mutate beyond our capability.

629
00:27:52,489 --> 00:27:54,749
So in two or three sentences,

630
00:27:54,749 --> 00:27:56,030
we kind of cheated and put an em dash.

631
00:27:56,030 --> 00:28:00,010
So, but you know, we can communicated a lot of the tone

632
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:03,451
that we were trying to do.

633
00:28:03,451 --> 00:28:06,231
And they were, they were fun to write these.

634
00:28:06,231 --> 00:28:07,272
And if you've finished.

635
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:12,269
and you still have them, I encourage you to go back and read them again, knowing what you know.

636
00:28:12,269 --> 00:28:20,591
So that was one of the ways that we could basically squeeze a lot of narrative into a short space.

637
00:28:20,591 --> 00:28:23,191
And we were limited. I mean, we didn't want to have,

638
00:28:23,191 --> 00:28:27,772
okay, let's start, and you've, card, read a card, read a card, read a card, read a, you're like, where did, you know,

639
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:30,073
a book in card form was not what we were going for.

640
00:28:31,123 --> 00:28:33,224
Yeah, one of the themes here was just trying to do a lot

641
00:28:33,224 --> 00:28:33,704
with a little.

642
00:28:33,704 --> 00:28:35,945
So the game ships with a bunch of stickers.

643
00:28:35,945 --> 00:28:38,287
These are psychological scars that you put on your

644
00:28:38,287 --> 00:28:38,747
character.

645
00:28:38,747 --> 00:28:41,468
And we don't have a lot of room on these,

646
00:28:41,468 --> 00:28:42,689
because they're small.

647
00:28:42,689 --> 00:28:44,530
They've got to go on the cards.

648
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:45,891
We have quite a few of them.

649
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,886
And there's localization to consider.

650
00:28:48,886 --> 00:28:51,628
The character count expands when you go to other languages.

651
00:28:51,628 --> 00:28:54,050
So how do you get this stuff across?

652
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:56,472
It turns out that just having a single keyword like

653
00:28:56,472 --> 00:29:01,055
insomniac or fear of small planes is enough of a hook to

654
00:29:01,055 --> 00:29:03,517
really get players role playing.

655
00:29:03,517 --> 00:29:06,979
It provides so much more story hooks than just the raw

656
00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:08,560
mechanism that's on the card.

657
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,802
So it doesn't take a whole lot to really

658
00:29:10,802 --> 00:29:12,023
unlock story elements.

659
00:29:12,243 --> 00:29:15,628
No, all of you who play these games want to tell a story.

660
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:18,052
So if we just say reduce your hand limit by one card,

661
00:29:18,052 --> 00:29:19,814
you're like, okay, but if it's like,

662
00:29:19,814 --> 00:29:22,599
why do you only have six cards or five cards in your hand?

663
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:24,061
It's like, cause I can't sleep.

664
00:29:25,229 --> 00:29:30,093
And like we just had to give you that one thing so you could shout out something during the game

665
00:29:30,093 --> 00:29:33,816
my favorite one was PTSD which is up in the corner, which

666
00:29:33,816 --> 00:29:38,100
You lose an action if you start in the region where you got this and then you write down to the region was one

667
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:43,124
Of our first ideas, which is I can't go back to Africa. Why like I just can't go back

668
00:29:43,124 --> 00:29:43,765
to Africa

669
00:29:43,765 --> 00:29:49,470
Which leads into the psychology of what we were trying to do and that's

670
00:29:50,395 --> 00:29:51,997
That's this next part that we're going to get into.

671
00:29:51,997 --> 00:29:53,438
So we've talked a little bit about the structure

672
00:29:53,438 --> 00:29:55,599
and we've talked a little bit about how we,

673
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:57,461
well, you know, arrange the story and then,

674
00:29:57,461 --> 00:29:58,662
but let's get into the psychology

675
00:29:58,662 --> 00:30:01,164
because it's very different in one of these games

676
00:30:01,164 --> 00:30:03,886
because you're committing to kind of go on this journey

677
00:30:03,886 --> 00:30:05,487
with us for 15 games.

678
00:30:05,487 --> 00:30:09,670
And you don't know what's going to happen, but we did, right?

679
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:11,431
So we wanted to have like a lot of moments

680
00:30:11,431 --> 00:30:12,853
that basically sort of scared you,

681
00:30:12,853 --> 00:30:15,054
but ultimately didn't get too scared

682
00:30:15,054 --> 00:30:16,916
or scared that you broke it.

683
00:30:16,916 --> 00:30:17,716
I didn't get that a lot.

684
00:30:17,716 --> 00:30:18,517
I think we broke it.

685
00:30:18,517 --> 00:30:19,237
No, you didn't break it.

686
00:30:20,955 --> 00:30:23,896
And this first method or trick is really obvious.

687
00:30:23,896 --> 00:30:26,837
I mean, there's a lot of package content that you can't

688
00:30:26,837 --> 00:30:27,677
see right away.

689
00:30:27,677 --> 00:30:29,318
There's eight packages.

690
00:30:29,318 --> 00:30:31,838
There's five dossiers, which are like little advent

691
00:30:31,838 --> 00:30:32,279
calendars.

692
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:35,500
So it's almost like a bunch of Christmas presents wrapped

693
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,340
up in the box.

694
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:40,321
And that led to a lot of fear of missing out, basically, on

695
00:30:40,321 --> 00:30:41,162
behalf of the players.

696
00:30:41,162 --> 00:30:43,683
They want to keep playing so they see what's inside the

697
00:30:43,683 --> 00:30:45,743
boxes, see what's behind the hidden doors.

698
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:48,584
That was a pretty powerful motivator for

699
00:30:48,584 --> 00:30:49,325
people to keep playing.

700
00:30:50,116 --> 00:30:51,697
And it's actually interesting psychologically,

701
00:30:51,697 --> 00:30:54,218
because you want to keep playing so you

702
00:30:54,218 --> 00:30:56,879
see what's in the packages.

703
00:30:56,879 --> 00:30:59,880
But people won't open the package.

704
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,322
Like, well, I don't have time, and my friend's moving away.

705
00:31:02,322 --> 00:31:05,943
I'll just open them up and see what happens.

706
00:31:05,943 --> 00:31:06,724
Like, no.

707
00:31:06,724 --> 00:31:07,564
No, you have to finish.

708
00:31:07,564 --> 00:31:08,004
Except for you.

709
00:31:08,004 --> 00:31:08,324
You did.

710
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:12,726
But that was for work.

711
00:31:12,726 --> 00:31:12,987
Sorry.

712
00:31:12,987 --> 00:31:15,788
So the next thing we did psychologically

713
00:31:15,788 --> 00:31:19,770
was we wanted you to care about these people in this world.

714
00:31:20,947 --> 00:31:24,433
and you care about things by giving them names.

715
00:31:24,433 --> 00:31:27,518
When you name something, you own a piece of it

716
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:28,179
and now you care.

717
00:31:28,179 --> 00:31:30,283
So the medic is fine.

718
00:31:30,283 --> 00:31:31,465
You probably played lots of pandemic

719
00:31:31,465 --> 00:31:32,848
where you're like, I'll be the medic.

720
00:31:33,977 --> 00:31:36,238
But that medic has a name, he's Pedro.

721
00:31:36,238 --> 00:31:38,918
And Pedro has feelings and he has a past

722
00:31:38,918 --> 00:31:42,499
and he's got a friend named Wallace up there in the corner.

723
00:31:42,499 --> 00:31:43,839
He's got some other things going on

724
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:45,739
that we've redacted for people who haven't played.

725
00:31:45,739 --> 00:31:48,620
And you can see down below that Pedro might end up

726
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,600
with a couple scars.

727
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,500
He might end up not sleeping well.

728
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,721
He might become afraid of airplanes.

729
00:31:54,721 --> 00:31:56,521
And the reason that we do this is

730
00:31:56,521 --> 00:31:57,921
we want you to have these little stories.

731
00:31:57,921 --> 00:31:59,222
We want you to have attachments.

732
00:31:59,222 --> 00:32:01,422
And so as you play with these characters

733
00:32:01,422 --> 00:32:02,462
and they go on their journey,

734
00:32:03,062 --> 00:32:07,065
It's much more interesting, because people are more interesting than things.

735
00:32:07,065 --> 00:32:11,989
And so, most people here are people, and so you understand how they work.

736
00:32:11,989 --> 00:32:19,354
And so, like, by basically giving you these little moments to imprint and bond on things,

737
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:21,035
then, you know, and get attached to it, you cared more.

738
00:32:21,035 --> 00:32:21,576
Want to do this one?

739
00:32:21,576 --> 00:32:24,098
Yeah, why don't you take this one?

740
00:32:24,098 --> 00:32:24,838
Okay.

741
00:32:24,838 --> 00:32:26,960
So, going back to our old friend, the up and down beats.

742
00:32:28,945 --> 00:32:34,727
I don't know if you noticed, but what we like to do in this game is, we like to give you

743
00:32:34,727 --> 00:32:36,027
a downbeat which is, here's a new problem.

744
00:32:36,027 --> 00:32:38,288
Like in January, we give you a problem.

745
00:32:38,288 --> 00:32:43,409
And you're like, this is a bad problem, we don't like this problem that you gave us.

746
00:32:43,409 --> 00:32:48,070
And then in February, you struggle with that new problem.

747
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:51,191
And it's a lot of work to try to fix it, and it's really distracting you.

748
00:32:51,191 --> 00:32:54,152
So then at the end of February, or the beginning of March...

749
00:32:55,122 --> 00:32:57,926
We give you a tool to make that problem easier.

750
00:32:57,926 --> 00:33:00,411
And because you've just struggled with it for a month,

751
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:01,893
you're like, oh, that's good.

752
00:33:01,893 --> 00:33:02,574
That's gonna help.

753
00:33:02,574 --> 00:33:03,556
That power's gonna help.

754
00:33:03,556 --> 00:33:04,798
That person's gonna help.

755
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:06,441
Okay, this is fantastic.

756
00:33:06,441 --> 00:33:06,481
Oh.

757
00:33:07,512 --> 00:33:08,793
they've just given us a new problem.

758
00:33:08,793 --> 00:33:11,134
And so we constantly give you a problem,

759
00:33:11,134 --> 00:33:12,614
let you struggle, give you some tools,

760
00:33:12,614 --> 00:33:13,995
give you a new problem, let you struggle,

761
00:33:13,995 --> 00:33:16,616
give you some tools, and just kind of repeat this process,

762
00:33:16,616 --> 00:33:18,096
not quite so formulaically,

763
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:20,777
but basically over the course of the 12 months.

764
00:33:20,777 --> 00:33:23,878
But as the problems mount, even though the tools mount,

765
00:33:23,878 --> 00:33:26,119
you don't have enough time or resources to use all of them.

766
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:27,139
So you're in a position of like,

767
00:33:27,139 --> 00:33:28,200
what do we use the tools for?

768
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,040
What do we not use the tools for?

769
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:30,981
And that's part of the...

770
00:33:31,621 --> 00:33:36,683
legacy experience where group A might choose to spend a lot of time on positive mutations

771
00:33:36,683 --> 00:33:41,084
so that they don't have to deal with diseases, where other people will use tools for other

772
00:33:41,084 --> 00:33:45,026
spoilery things so they don't have to deal with those problems over there.

773
00:33:45,026 --> 00:33:48,287
But either way, you don't have enough tools to make the game easier, just choosing which

774
00:33:48,287 --> 00:33:52,128
things are easier for you and which things you have to work with.

775
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:56,950
But there was that upbeat, downbeat of problem, struggle, solution that we gave you.

776
00:33:59,217 --> 00:34:01,579
We were able to pull off a lot of these psychological tricks,

777
00:34:01,579 --> 00:34:03,780
I think, because the players trusted us.

778
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:06,822
And in order to build that trust, we designed in some

779
00:34:06,822 --> 00:34:08,023
safety nets into the game.

780
00:34:08,023 --> 00:34:11,305
This is box eight, or package eight, one of my favorite

781
00:34:11,305 --> 00:34:12,545
things in the game.

782
00:34:12,545 --> 00:34:14,987
When you open up the box, one of the first instructions you

783
00:34:14,987 --> 00:34:18,169
read is to take this sticker that you see here off the

784
00:34:18,169 --> 00:34:20,090
sticker sheet and put it on box eight.

785
00:34:20,675 --> 00:34:22,576
We don't say why that's important.

786
00:34:22,576 --> 00:34:24,578
We don't really spend a whole lot of time on it.

787
00:34:24,578 --> 00:34:26,740
But it's the absolute first thing you see and the first

788
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,001
thing you're supposed to do.

789
00:34:28,001 --> 00:34:30,643
So you know internally, hey, this is kind of important.

790
00:34:30,643 --> 00:34:33,665
And if you read it, it says, open package 8 if you lose

791
00:34:33,665 --> 00:34:34,406
four games in a row.

792
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:37,729
It's just one simple sentence, but it provided just

793
00:34:37,729 --> 00:34:39,190
tremendous amounts of value to us.

794
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:42,311
As you can imagine, we had a lot of playtesters, and some

795
00:34:42,311 --> 00:34:44,813
of them would lose a game and get a little frustrated.

796
00:34:44,813 --> 00:34:46,674
Then they'd lose another one and get frustrated.

797
00:34:46,674 --> 00:34:48,755
If they lost that third one, they were about ready to

798
00:34:48,755 --> 00:34:52,256
consider their $70 purchase a complete waste of time, shred

799
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:55,898
the thing, be embarrassed, put it on the shelf, or say nasty

800
00:34:55,898 --> 00:34:58,640
things about at least Rob on Twitter.

801
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,882
He gets all the mean tweets.

802
00:35:04,443 --> 00:35:06,984
But we're able to get around that by just including this

803
00:35:06,984 --> 00:35:07,945
the single sticker.

804
00:35:07,945 --> 00:35:10,427
Basically, so now if you lose those three games, you're like,

805
00:35:10,427 --> 00:35:11,427
OK, we lost three.

806
00:35:11,427 --> 00:35:12,428
We suck.

807
00:35:12,428 --> 00:35:15,891
But at least we didn't have to open up package eight.

808
00:35:15,891 --> 00:35:18,873
It kind of sets its anchor at four, which is like, OK, four

809
00:35:18,873 --> 00:35:19,353
is bad.

810
00:35:20,294 --> 00:35:24,556
But also, you know, that, hey, you know, if we do lose four games, at least we get to

811
00:35:24,556 --> 00:35:25,396
open the present.

812
00:35:25,396 --> 00:35:27,898
You know, we get to open up the package and see what's in there.

813
00:35:27,898 --> 00:35:29,759
And there are things in there that are going to help you.

814
00:35:29,759 --> 00:35:32,940
So you open it up and there is a safety net.

815
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:37,543
There's some material in there that will help you get your game back on track and get you

816
00:35:37,543 --> 00:35:38,083
back on the rails.

817
00:35:38,083 --> 00:35:43,586
And so it's a very simple solution, but provided just a tremendous amount of value to the game.

818
00:35:44,646 --> 00:35:48,871
Yeah, and I do see a lot of people when they write, you know, talks about this like we

819
00:35:48,871 --> 00:35:53,596
struggled, we didn't do a good job, at the end we feel like we didn't do that well, but

820
00:35:53,596 --> 00:35:58,061
we didn't open package eight.

821
00:35:58,061 --> 00:35:59,042
So they feel good about it.

822
00:35:59,042 --> 00:36:04,768
So as you can imagine, this is just a sheer joy to play, test, and balance.

823
00:36:06,775 --> 00:36:10,538
And so we're going to talk a little bit about how we did

824
00:36:10,538 --> 00:36:13,240
that, which is the following talk.

825
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,481
I just really like that pun.

826
00:36:14,481 --> 00:36:15,542
I'm sorry.

827
00:36:15,542 --> 00:36:17,964
It was very early, and it made me laugh too hard.

828
00:36:17,964 --> 00:36:19,385
All right.

829
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:22,127
So this is something that Matt taught me.

830
00:36:22,127 --> 00:36:22,648
So Matt will.

831
00:36:22,648 --> 00:36:24,529
So I came out of user experience design in the

832
00:36:24,529 --> 00:36:26,390
Valley, where we did a lot of usability testing.

833
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:29,313
And we started to do some ethnographic research at Yahoo

834
00:36:29,313 --> 00:36:32,235
where we'd go into the field with cameras and record people

835
00:36:32,235 --> 00:36:32,975
using our products.

836
00:36:34,236 --> 00:36:36,897
Since then, everybody got these smartphones.

837
00:36:36,897 --> 00:36:38,497
Everybody's got a camera phone in their pocket.

838
00:36:38,497 --> 00:36:41,558
And I just started taking advantage of that.

839
00:36:41,558 --> 00:36:44,059
So for the last, I don't know, three or four years, I've been

840
00:36:44,059 --> 00:36:47,180
asking people who are blind testing to take out their

841
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:50,161
phones and just record themselves as they're playing

842
00:36:50,161 --> 00:36:52,482
the game on their kitchen table.

843
00:36:52,482 --> 00:36:55,643
And it's amazing the kinds of data and how valuable that

844
00:36:55,643 --> 00:36:56,163
information is.

845
00:36:56,163 --> 00:36:58,124
In addition to just.

846
00:37:00,024 --> 00:37:02,465
I'm always surprised at how relaxed people are in this

847
00:37:02,465 --> 00:37:04,266
environment, because they're using their own equipment.

848
00:37:04,266 --> 00:37:05,367
They're in their own home.

849
00:37:05,367 --> 00:37:08,569
I've got video of people smoking pot in front of me.

850
00:37:08,569 --> 00:37:10,390
This was before it was legal.

851
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:12,631
On camera, recorded, sent to a stranger they don't know.

852
00:37:12,631 --> 00:37:14,492
Just really relaxed.

853
00:37:14,492 --> 00:37:17,133
So you get very naturalistic feedback on it.

854
00:37:17,133 --> 00:37:19,895
And you get feedback that you wouldn't get from a

855
00:37:19,895 --> 00:37:22,896
self-report form or just from analyzing the raw data.

856
00:37:22,896 --> 00:37:26,258
So one of my favorite moments from this group was actually

857
00:37:26,258 --> 00:37:27,499
watching them open up.

858
00:37:28,676 --> 00:37:33,740
A big reveal at the end of Act One, in an early version of the game, where the thing

859
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:36,262
just landed like a ton of bricks.

860
00:37:36,262 --> 00:37:39,124
It was just a dead, dead beat.

861
00:37:39,124 --> 00:37:45,049
They looked at each other, they shook their heads, and you would never see that on a feedback

862
00:37:45,049 --> 00:37:48,211
form, but they were just, you know, it did not work for them at all.

863
00:37:48,652 --> 00:37:52,437
all, and we knew that we needed to rejigger the story.

864
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:54,079
This wasn't a mechanical thing.

865
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:57,103
This was a thematic thing.

866
00:37:57,103 --> 00:38:00,447
And it's something that we just wouldn't have been able to

867
00:38:00,447 --> 00:38:03,692
internalize and really empathize with if we hadn't

868
00:38:03,692 --> 00:38:05,474
seen it on camera above the table.

869
00:38:06,064 --> 00:38:10,285
So, yeah, so we just get a ton of feedback from that.

870
00:38:10,285 --> 00:38:13,266
Yeah, so what we do is every time we have a version ready to go,

871
00:38:13,266 --> 00:38:15,026
we find somewhere between two to four groups.

872
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:18,347
And those groups will play as many games as we have done.

873
00:38:18,347 --> 00:38:21,628
So we might only have, like, January through March or January through July.

874
00:38:21,628 --> 00:38:25,069
They record every game. Then they upload it as they play.

875
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:26,489
And then we watch them and we take notes.

876
00:38:26,489 --> 00:38:30,590
And we have discovered that 1.6 speed is as fast as you can go

877
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:31,611
and still pay attention.

878
00:38:33,819 --> 00:38:36,141
Sometimes I'll push it to 1.8, but I miss things.

879
00:38:36,141 --> 00:38:40,466
Because we're looking at dozens or hundreds of hours

880
00:38:40,466 --> 00:38:42,508
for each batch of playtesting.

881
00:38:42,508 --> 00:38:45,932
Yeah, it was somewhere between 100 and 200 hours for season 1.

882
00:38:45,932 --> 00:38:47,533
It was more for season 2.

883
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:52,238
And so that turns into the wonderful world of game design.

884
00:38:53,017 --> 00:38:57,442
which is a giant spreadsheet of notes and anecdotes,

885
00:38:57,442 --> 00:39:00,405
whether it says observation, which might lead,

886
00:39:00,405 --> 00:39:04,369
if you see the green, a design idea, red is an issue,

887
00:39:04,369 --> 00:39:06,392
the time code, because he'll watch maybe group A

888
00:39:06,392 --> 00:39:09,335
and I'll watch group B and we record the timing,

889
00:39:09,335 --> 00:39:11,617
so if I see a note on his, I can go to the video and do it.

890
00:39:12,478 --> 00:39:17,001
We have redacted things out out of courtesy for people who haven't played,

891
00:39:17,001 --> 00:39:20,544
but there's two things of interest to note.

892
00:39:20,544 --> 00:39:23,506
One is, that's 730 notes from this particular round,

893
00:39:23,506 --> 00:39:25,947
and you get things like this.

894
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:29,430
How do you exhibit abnormal thoughts?

895
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:32,932
This was a throwaway comment from one playtester.

896
00:39:32,932 --> 00:39:35,594
So, the end of Act 1, there's something that's revealed,

897
00:39:35,594 --> 00:39:37,055
and the card had said, you know,

898
00:39:37,055 --> 00:39:38,716
duh, they're exhibiting abnormal thoughts.

899
00:39:38,716 --> 00:39:40,317
He says, how do you exhibit abnormal thoughts?

900
00:39:40,317 --> 00:39:40,477
I'm like...

901
00:39:41,206 --> 00:39:42,126
That's a really good point.

902
00:39:42,126 --> 00:39:46,267
So the final card says they're exhibiting abnormal behavior.

903
00:39:46,267 --> 00:39:48,488
Never would have caught that, because I wrote it.

904
00:39:48,488 --> 00:39:49,608
That made perfect sense.

905
00:39:49,608 --> 00:39:51,569
Everyone read it, unless someone on the video

906
00:39:51,569 --> 00:39:54,250
is like made this comment, and then it got recorded here.

907
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:56,010
And then we're like, yeah, yeah, that should be fixed.

908
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:58,271
So you find these tiny, tiny things.

909
00:39:59,231 --> 00:40:03,794
Another thing I like to, just for myself, to keep myself honest is to note all the observations

910
00:40:03,794 --> 00:40:06,036
and issues separately from the ideas.

911
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:09,398
As often I'll watch a group that I'll be sitting with and I'll have tons of ideas and I'll

912
00:40:09,398 --> 00:40:13,001
write down all the ideas, but I won't, I'll just sweep all the issues under the rug.

913
00:40:13,001 --> 00:40:16,203
I just want to make the game better, you know, cut to the chase, just put the good idea in.

914
00:40:16,864 --> 00:40:18,465
But then you find out that the good idea is not so good

915
00:40:18,465 --> 00:40:20,506
anymore, and you throw the idea out, and you've lost

916
00:40:20,506 --> 00:40:21,887
track of the issue.

917
00:40:21,887 --> 00:40:25,390
So just kind of like bracketing all this stuff,

918
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:27,531
bracketing the ideas over here and the observations and the

919
00:40:27,531 --> 00:40:29,653
issues really helps keep us honest, I think, when we're

920
00:40:29,653 --> 00:40:30,173
doing it.

921
00:40:30,173 --> 00:40:33,916
So this catches many interesting things.

922
00:40:33,916 --> 00:40:36,417
We're going to kind of show you something that was on the

923
00:40:36,417 --> 00:40:37,839
editing room floor from season one.

924
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:39,940
So as you get to the middle of the game, those of you who

925
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:41,581
have played, we ask you to go search for things.

926
00:40:42,343 --> 00:40:46,807
And it's a relatively simple little side journey that we wanted to do.

927
00:40:46,807 --> 00:40:51,692
And the final game shipped with a simple little side mechanism by which to do it.

928
00:40:51,692 --> 00:40:55,936
But we got so caught up in the design when we were first doing it, it's like,

929
00:40:55,936 --> 00:40:59,379
people are going to want a whole new game to break out right here.

930
00:40:59,379 --> 00:41:02,082
Like you're like, and so we designed.

931
00:41:02,654 --> 00:41:03,674
This thing

932
00:41:03,674 --> 00:41:11,156
This is one of I think three different probably more than we lost like a man trying to create like

933
00:41:11,156 --> 00:41:15,876
You're at a game and another now obviously this isn't the final graphics where the ads idea cuz pandemic

934
00:41:15,876 --> 00:41:21,397
You know takes place in world and that you go to cities and so we wanted like oh, we want you to search Paris

935
00:41:21,397 --> 00:41:24,458
Well, so we're gonna zoom in and there's gonna be like a city block card

936
00:41:24,458 --> 00:41:30,419
And now it's gonna be almost like a tactical mini game where you're moving and there's AI stuff moving. We were so delighted

937
00:41:31,703 --> 00:41:32,604
It was kind of cool.

938
00:41:32,604 --> 00:41:34,705
It was also just kind of stapled on the side of the game.

939
00:41:34,705 --> 00:41:36,246
It didn't really make any sense at all.

940
00:41:36,246 --> 00:41:37,066
Right.

941
00:41:37,066 --> 00:41:38,987
You'd need like a whole other table, right,

942
00:41:38,987 --> 00:41:40,228
to manage this and stuff.

943
00:41:40,228 --> 00:41:44,310
So we noticed very early on that every time this was about June,

944
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:45,150
I think it comes out.

945
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:46,851
I just watched the players kind of deflate

946
00:41:46,851 --> 00:41:48,112
when they had to pull this stuff out.

947
00:41:48,112 --> 00:41:49,213
And then they're like reading it,

948
00:41:49,213 --> 00:41:51,154
and then the whole thing comes to a stop for 20 minutes,

949
00:41:51,154 --> 00:41:54,175
right, like right in the middle of a 45-minute game,

950
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:57,677
you have a 20-minute break, which is horrible.

951
00:41:57,677 --> 00:42:00,398
So anyway, we kept simplifying and simplifying.

952
00:42:01,042 --> 00:42:02,762
until we made it as simple as possible.

953
00:42:02,762 --> 00:42:05,403
And then everyone's like, this is great, thank you.

954
00:42:05,403 --> 00:42:06,784
But we had never shown that before.

955
00:42:06,784 --> 00:42:07,584
It took us a while to find it.

956
00:42:07,584 --> 00:42:10,485
And we were laughing last week when we pulled that out.

957
00:42:10,485 --> 00:42:14,127
Like, yeah, that was a great idea.

958
00:42:14,127 --> 00:42:18,589
So then after we get those 700 and some odd observations,

959
00:42:18,589 --> 00:42:19,689
we have a lot of phone calls.

960
00:42:19,689 --> 00:42:22,270
We live on opposite coasts, so we use video conferencing.

961
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:24,891
And we go through each one, and we talk about it.

962
00:42:24,891 --> 00:42:26,492
And then we turn it into a punch list

963
00:42:26,492 --> 00:42:29,453
that's smaller but still pretty big of things we want to do.

964
00:42:29,453 --> 00:42:29,513
So.

965
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:32,881
Here's one list of all the changes we made coming out of

966
00:42:32,881 --> 00:42:33,402
a play test.

967
00:42:33,402 --> 00:42:37,645
It's deliberately so small that you can't read it here.

968
00:42:37,645 --> 00:42:40,088
But when this talk is up later, you can go through and

969
00:42:40,088 --> 00:42:42,790
see all the notes if you're so inclined.

970
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:45,352
Yeah, so all the issues and ideas get converted into

971
00:42:45,352 --> 00:42:48,035
really prescriptive, very specific things that we can do

972
00:42:48,035 --> 00:42:49,856
and we sign up for them and knock them off.

973
00:42:49,856 --> 00:42:52,479
And yeah, do all the, I don't know.

974
00:42:52,479 --> 00:42:55,942
I've got a little bit of an Agile background, so we're

975
00:42:55,942 --> 00:42:56,682
able to, you know.

976
00:42:57,383 --> 00:42:58,544
apply some of that.

977
00:42:58,544 --> 00:43:01,045
It's easier for us, because it's just the two of us.

978
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:02,646
We can do it all in Drive.

979
00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:06,029
But yeah, we can be pretty efficient this way.

980
00:43:06,029 --> 00:43:08,210
But some stuff does get through.

981
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:08,590
This next.

982
00:43:10,057 --> 00:43:11,959
This next card actually slipped through the cracks.

983
00:43:11,959 --> 00:43:16,362
This is one card that looks pretty innocent, just as time

984
00:43:16,362 --> 00:43:17,543
is running out.

985
00:43:17,543 --> 00:43:19,945
And it's got some fairly simple instructions, though at

986
00:43:19,945 --> 00:43:22,648
least they look simple to me and Rob and our copy editor.

987
00:43:22,648 --> 00:43:27,111
So it turns out, though, humans have a real hard time

988
00:43:27,111 --> 00:43:29,273
with cognition when it comes to a negative

989
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,054
paired with an or.

990
00:43:30,714 --> 00:43:34,496
I don't know why, but just tons of posts on BoardGameGeek

991
00:43:34,496 --> 00:43:37,337
about this one, not opening the wrong package, being

992
00:43:37,337 --> 00:43:38,138
confused, and so on.

993
00:43:38,138 --> 00:43:44,141
So we've reworded this in the second printing.

994
00:43:44,141 --> 00:43:46,602
But you can't catch everything.

995
00:43:46,602 --> 00:43:47,603
Yeah, what we meant.

996
00:43:49,635 --> 00:43:54,157
Was if either six or seven was unopened, scratch this card.

997
00:43:54,157 --> 00:43:57,398
Not that they both had to be unopened or both opened.

998
00:43:57,398 --> 00:43:59,239
It made perfect sense.

999
00:43:59,239 --> 00:44:00,280
Every time I read it now, I'm like, no, it

1000
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,060
makes perfect sense.

1001
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:01,340
But it does.

1002
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:03,081
Yeah, I think if you're an engineer or you're into

1003
00:44:03,081 --> 00:44:04,622
grammar, then you're like, solid.

1004
00:44:04,622 --> 00:44:08,484
But this caused some problems because this was a big moment.

1005
00:44:08,484 --> 00:44:10,585
So having a lot of people scratch it when they shouldn't

1006
00:44:10,585 --> 00:44:12,946
or should when, or actually the big problem is people

1007
00:44:12,946 --> 00:44:14,306
didn't scratch it when they should have.

1008
00:44:14,917 --> 00:44:16,960
And this is supposed to get the game back on track.

1009
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,262
If you are behind on some certain objectives

1010
00:44:19,262 --> 00:44:20,484
and you're entering act three

1011
00:44:20,484 --> 00:44:22,486
and we want those objectives to be solved,

1012
00:44:22,486 --> 00:44:24,568
we wanna catch you back up.

1013
00:44:24,568 --> 00:44:26,631
And so if you don't scratch it and you keep playing

1014
00:44:26,631 --> 00:44:27,972
and then you get to a point where like,

1015
00:44:27,972 --> 00:44:29,794
wait, we can't, we can't win.

1016
00:44:29,794 --> 00:44:32,097
And then you have to go back and find that card

1017
00:44:32,097 --> 00:44:33,298
and realize you should have scratched it.

1018
00:44:33,298 --> 00:44:35,000
So we cleaned up the language there.

1019
00:44:35,667 --> 00:44:38,308
Another valuable thing that you learn from doing the video

1020
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:40,909
testing is just how well the actual

1021
00:44:40,909 --> 00:44:43,230
physical components work.

1022
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:45,011
Does that sticker fit in the rules?

1023
00:44:45,011 --> 00:44:47,872
Can people find things in the rules?

1024
00:44:47,872 --> 00:44:50,273
Do the pieces actually fit on the board?

1025
00:44:50,273 --> 00:44:53,875
That sort of stuff, all the human factors kinds of things.

1026
00:44:53,875 --> 00:44:56,716
When we were designing this game, we had a legacy deck

1027
00:44:56,716 --> 00:44:57,497
that had stickers in it.

1028
00:44:57,497 --> 00:44:59,878
So as you played the game, you would find a card that had

1029
00:44:59,878 --> 00:45:02,119
stickers in it, you'd peel it off, real easy, real

1030
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:02,759
straightforward.

1031
00:45:03,499 --> 00:45:06,481
But at the 11th hour, we found out that we actually couldn't

1032
00:45:06,481 --> 00:45:08,002
put sticker cards in the deck.

1033
00:45:08,002 --> 00:45:10,463
And we had a lot of them in there.

1034
00:45:10,463 --> 00:45:13,805
And this was sort of a panicky moment.

1035
00:45:13,805 --> 00:45:16,847
But we worked through it and came up with these dossiers.

1036
00:45:16,847 --> 00:45:20,008
The thing is, we were never able to test the dossiers.

1037
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:24,091
And so a few things showed up after the game was printed

1038
00:45:24,091 --> 00:45:25,331
that became problems.

1039
00:45:25,331 --> 00:45:28,493
For example, if you have a dossier door numbered six and

1040
00:45:28,493 --> 00:45:31,555
a box numbered six, and you tell your players to open

1041
00:45:31,555 --> 00:45:31,855
number six.

1042
00:45:32,975 --> 00:45:34,996
you know, sometimes they might open the wrong thing.

1043
00:45:34,996 --> 00:45:36,316
This was encoded.

1044
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:39,398
Not everybody makes this mistake, but some people did.

1045
00:45:39,398 --> 00:45:41,199
They jumped ahead and opened up package six

1046
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:43,240
instead of door number six to their disappointment,

1047
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,941
I guess would be the best way to say it.

1048
00:45:45,941 --> 00:45:47,402
Yeah, no, it's particularly frustrating

1049
00:45:47,402 --> 00:45:49,483
because we tell you to open door number six.

1050
00:45:49,483 --> 00:45:52,344
It's either the first or one of the first things to open,

1051
00:45:52,344 --> 00:45:54,145
so you're very excited about opening something

1052
00:45:54,145 --> 00:45:56,026
and you haven't seen any other context.

1053
00:45:56,026 --> 00:46:00,408
Package six is probably the last thing I want you to open

1054
00:46:00,408 --> 00:46:02,129
by mistake at that moment.

1055
00:46:02,647 --> 00:46:07,589
So it was particularly bad numbering at a particularly bad time.

1056
00:46:07,589 --> 00:46:15,352
The lesson here was that, you know, this kind of testing with video and actually the physical components can unearth some of this stuff.

1057
00:46:15,352 --> 00:46:23,375
We did a better job in season two in that everything's uniquely numbered, like the package numbers and the dossier numbers all have unique coding, so you can't possibly do that.

1058
00:46:23,375 --> 00:46:28,077
But, you know, again, it's because we were done the game when we came up with the dossiers.

1059
00:46:28,389 --> 00:46:29,149
This one's related.

1060
00:46:29,149 --> 00:46:32,430
If you pull a door off the dossier, you've got it in your

1061
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:33,970
hand, you're very excited about the card, you don't

1062
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:36,571
look back at the tear sheet that you just pulled it from.

1063
00:46:36,571 --> 00:46:39,172
Even if it's got a big yellow box that's screaming at you to

1064
00:46:39,172 --> 00:46:40,992
read it, lots of people don't do that.

1065
00:46:40,992 --> 00:46:44,693
So that's another thing that we would have unearthed, I

1066
00:46:44,693 --> 00:46:46,153
think, if we were doing a higher fidelity test.

1067
00:46:46,153 --> 00:46:46,774
So yeah, that's most of our talk.

1068
00:46:46,774 --> 00:46:55,416
Basically what happened was we did it, and it came out, and

1069
00:46:55,416 --> 00:46:56,516
it did well.

1070
00:46:58,103 --> 00:46:59,704
And, you know, yay, Hobbits.

1071
00:46:59,704 --> 00:47:04,589
And so, by and large, it did well.

1072
00:47:04,589 --> 00:47:07,391
A lot of our stuff that we tried to do, set out to do.

1073
00:47:07,391 --> 00:47:10,954
And so, we wanted to leave you quickly.

1074
00:47:10,954 --> 00:47:14,337
We got about 13 minutes with three quick takeaways,

1075
00:47:14,337 --> 00:47:17,780
which was you can evoke a story with highlights,

1076
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:20,363
attachment to characters, and using some tropes like, oh,

1077
00:47:20,363 --> 00:47:22,184
the world's ending, or I'm the medic.

1078
00:47:22,184 --> 00:47:23,225
And.

1079
00:47:24,518 --> 00:47:27,359
Yeah, you can do a lot of this.

1080
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:30,341
You can actually manipulate people's emotions

1081
00:47:30,341 --> 00:47:31,141
if they trust you.

1082
00:47:31,141 --> 00:47:34,442
And building that trust, you can use safety nets and anchors

1083
00:47:34,442 --> 00:47:37,263
and provide the appropriate incentives in order to do that.

1084
00:47:37,263 --> 00:47:39,944
And the last thing is, everyone thinks of the game

1085
00:47:39,944 --> 00:47:41,625
as what happens when you take your first turn

1086
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:43,645
until the game is over, but this game's,

1087
00:47:43,645 --> 00:47:46,286
especially legacy games, are experiences.

1088
00:47:46,286 --> 00:47:49,487
So if you test above the table how people are reacting,

1089
00:47:49,487 --> 00:47:52,829
you get a lot more knowledge about the experience itself

1090
00:47:52,829 --> 00:47:54,089
rather than the gameplay itself.

1091
00:47:55,133 --> 00:47:57,534
And that's kind of it.

1092
00:47:57,534 --> 00:47:58,335
We have 13 minutes.

1093
00:47:58,335 --> 00:48:00,616
I want to get time to some questions.

1094
00:48:00,616 --> 00:48:04,118
So we'll just leave that up there for no particular reason

1095
00:48:04,118 --> 00:48:05,639
while we take questions.

1096
00:48:05,639 --> 00:48:05,779
So.

1097
00:48:05,779 --> 00:48:05,939
So.

1098
00:48:05,939 --> 00:48:06,160
So.

1099
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:06,280
So.

1100
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:06,380
So.

1101
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:06,500
So.

1102
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:06,540
So.

1103
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:06,700
So.

1104
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:06,760
So.

1105
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:06,820
So.

1106
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:06,860
So.

1107
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:06,940
So.

1108
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:07,000
So.

1109
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:07,060
So.

1110
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:07,100
So.

1111
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:07,160
So.

1112
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:07,220
So.

1113
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:07,300
So.

1114
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:07,720
So.

1115
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:15,625
So.

1116
00:48:15,625 --> 00:48:15,765
So.

1117
00:48:15,765 --> 00:48:15,865
So.

1118
00:48:15,865 --> 00:48:16,126
So.

1119
00:48:16,126 --> 00:48:16,166
So.

1120
00:48:16,166 --> 00:48:16,546
So.

1121
00:48:16,546 --> 00:48:16,666
So.

1122
00:48:16,666 --> 00:48:16,786
So.

1123
00:48:16,786 --> 00:48:16,926
So.

1124
00:48:16,926 --> 00:48:17,126
So.

1125
00:48:17,126 --> 00:48:17,226
So.

1126
00:48:17,226 --> 00:48:17,326
So.

1127
00:48:17,326 --> 00:48:17,366
So.

1128
00:48:17,366 --> 00:48:17,426
So.

1129
00:48:17,426 --> 00:48:17,546
So.

1130
00:48:17,546 --> 00:48:17,687
So.

1131
00:48:17,687 --> 00:48:17,727
So.

1132
00:48:21,548 --> 00:48:26,810
Why on earth did you make me destroy so many cards?

1133
00:48:26,810 --> 00:48:27,270
I trusted you.

1134
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:28,690
Yes.

1135
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:33,132
So that is always the big thing is destroying a card.

1136
00:48:33,132 --> 00:48:34,212
A card is a piece of cardboard.

1137
00:48:34,212 --> 00:48:35,512
You destroy cardboard all the time.

1138
00:48:35,512 --> 00:48:38,153
And it's imbued with meaning because we've been trained

1139
00:48:38,153 --> 00:48:40,014
not to destroy cards.

1140
00:48:40,014 --> 00:48:42,174
You can get by by not destroying them.

1141
00:48:42,174 --> 00:48:45,355
It's just our way of saying, you won't need this again.

1142
00:48:45,355 --> 00:48:46,335
It's going to get in the way.

1143
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:47,356
It's going to cause clutter.

1144
00:48:48,057 --> 00:48:55,048
Ultimately, if you ripped up an entire deck of cards and just like a fit of rage or whatever you wanted to do you will

1145
00:48:55,048 --> 00:49:01,337
basically spent 50 cents worth of material and then you can recycle it and it's nothing I

1146
00:49:02,363 --> 00:49:04,964
It was an idea for Risk Legacy and I'm like,

1147
00:49:04,964 --> 00:49:06,004
will people dare to do this?

1148
00:49:06,004 --> 00:49:07,685
And it was really, really dramatic,

1149
00:49:07,685 --> 00:49:10,346
but I wanted people to be like, this is permanent,

1150
00:49:10,346 --> 00:49:12,627
this is a one-way trip, you're playing with real money.

1151
00:49:12,627 --> 00:49:13,487
It raises the stakes.

1152
00:49:13,487 --> 00:49:14,927
It raises the stakes, right?

1153
00:49:14,927 --> 00:49:17,028
You just put the chips on the board

1154
00:49:17,028 --> 00:49:19,209
and now you've got something to lose.

1155
00:49:19,209 --> 00:49:22,530
That's a little teaser for the next talk.

1156
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:22,730
Thanks.

1157
00:49:26,262 --> 00:49:31,428
Hi, I just wanted to say thank you for this pretty amazing experience that I've had over

1158
00:49:31,428 --> 00:49:34,391
the last couple of months playing Pandemic Legacy.

1159
00:49:34,391 --> 00:49:35,372
It's been incredible.

1160
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:40,658
But I have a question, it's more about the original Pandemic, if you don't mind.

1161
00:49:40,858 --> 00:49:42,318
Sure.

1162
00:49:42,318 --> 00:49:45,759
One of the most amazing mechanics I've seen in a long

1163
00:49:45,759 --> 00:49:48,039
time is the idea of when you have an epidemic, you pull a

1164
00:49:48,039 --> 00:49:51,760
card from the bottom to infect a new region.

1165
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:52,980
Where did this idea come from?

1166
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:55,941
I have to credit Tom Lehman for that.

1167
00:49:55,941 --> 00:49:58,081
We were doing a lot of playtesting at Alan Moon's

1168
00:49:58,081 --> 00:49:58,982
Gathering of Friends.

1169
00:49:58,982 --> 00:50:01,942
And we noticed that when the epidemic cards came out,

1170
00:50:01,942 --> 00:50:03,743
sometimes there was a lot of tension, and

1171
00:50:03,743 --> 00:50:04,563
sometimes there wasn't.

1172
00:50:05,003 --> 00:50:07,465
And it was only those moments where there weren't cities

1173
00:50:07,465 --> 00:50:09,547
with three infection cubes on there.

1174
00:50:09,547 --> 00:50:12,690
And so he suggested this very simple idea of taking a card

1175
00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:13,271
off the bottom.

1176
00:50:13,271 --> 00:50:17,194
It's off the bottom so you don't pull a card you've

1177
00:50:17,194 --> 00:50:17,955
already had.

1178
00:50:17,955 --> 00:50:20,197
And always an epidemic card is a problem

1179
00:50:20,197 --> 00:50:21,698
from that point forward.

1180
00:50:21,698 --> 00:50:22,219
So yeah.

1181
00:50:22,219 --> 00:50:22,399
Thanks.

1182
00:50:23,924 --> 00:50:24,064
Hi.

1183
00:50:24,064 --> 00:50:29,349
So a question for both about co-op games and alpha gamer

1184
00:50:29,349 --> 00:50:32,011
situations, especially we hear about it with pandemic a lot,

1185
00:50:32,011 --> 00:50:33,072
and I've been in those situations.

1186
00:50:33,072 --> 00:50:35,374
Does the legacy format help with that?

1187
00:50:35,374 --> 00:50:39,357
Did you consider that as part of the design as a possible

1188
00:50:39,357 --> 00:50:41,479
problem that this could alleviate?

1189
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:45,561
I don't think it was something that either Rob or I actually set out to try to solve,

1190
00:50:45,561 --> 00:50:49,563
but I do think it helps that there's some blurriness, there's some fog there.

1191
00:50:49,563 --> 00:50:52,444
You don't know exactly the one way to win.

1192
00:50:52,444 --> 00:50:57,027
Because there's some uncertainty and there's lots of different ways to play the game, right?

1193
00:50:57,027 --> 00:51:01,048
Are you trying to optimize for the specific game you're playing tactically, or are you

1194
00:51:01,048 --> 00:51:05,330
more focused on the long-term effects that affect the board for the entire arc?

1195
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:09,032
And because there's no one right answer, I think that mitigates it somewhat.

1196
00:51:09,797 --> 00:51:13,364
Yeah, I talk about this a little in my talk tomorrow about Legacy Games.

1197
00:51:13,364 --> 00:51:14,907
Legacy Games...

1198
00:51:15,774 --> 00:51:17,296
you avoid mastery, right?

1199
00:51:17,296 --> 00:51:18,637
Every, if you play a game enough time,

1200
00:51:18,637 --> 00:51:20,339
you feel like you know how to play

1201
00:51:20,339 --> 00:51:22,501
and then you're only being surprised by the variety

1202
00:51:22,501 --> 00:51:23,882
within like the shuffle of the cards

1203
00:51:23,882 --> 00:51:25,504
or someone else's actions.

1204
00:51:25,504 --> 00:51:27,646
But with the legacy game, every game is a brand new game.

1205
00:51:27,646 --> 00:51:30,829
And so you never quite are at that level of mastery.

1206
00:51:30,829 --> 00:51:33,631
So to some extent, it might mitigate the alpha gamer saying,

1207
00:51:33,631 --> 00:51:35,413
I played this 50 times, I know how to win

1208
00:51:35,413 --> 00:51:39,397
because they just got the same piece of new information

1209
00:51:39,397 --> 00:51:40,938
that you did.

1210
00:51:40,938 --> 00:51:41,399
So a bit.

1211
00:51:41,399 --> 00:51:41,659
Thank you.

1212
00:51:43,777 --> 00:51:44,257
Thank you.

1213
00:51:44,257 --> 00:51:45,938
These games sound amazing.

1214
00:51:45,938 --> 00:51:47,279
I wonder if you could speak a bit more

1215
00:51:47,279 --> 00:51:48,479
about your testing process.

1216
00:51:48,479 --> 00:51:50,820
Did you also have them do written responses

1217
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:52,361
in addition to the videos?

1218
00:51:52,361 --> 00:51:55,103
And how did you compose those questions,

1219
00:51:55,103 --> 00:51:56,384
given that you were also going to see

1220
00:51:56,384 --> 00:51:57,384
their entire game on video?

1221
00:51:57,384 --> 00:52:00,066
I think we did virtually no self-report.

1222
00:52:00,066 --> 00:52:01,707
We did not.

1223
00:52:01,707 --> 00:52:04,888
Well, we had groups who sat down and did a focus

1224
00:52:04,888 --> 00:52:07,970
group for themselves on video for our benefit,

1225
00:52:07,970 --> 00:52:09,031
and that was really helpful.

1226
00:52:09,591 --> 00:52:12,993
But I don't think Rob or I actually can post any questions

1227
00:52:12,993 --> 00:52:14,094
for them to answer directly.

1228
00:52:14,094 --> 00:52:16,336
We did collect some data for win-loss and that sort of

1229
00:52:16,336 --> 00:52:18,517
thing, but most of it is on the tape.

1230
00:52:18,517 --> 00:52:23,681
I mean, if it was, we could look at the players and we

1231
00:52:23,681 --> 00:52:25,062
could see their emotions.

1232
00:52:25,062 --> 00:52:26,663
They didn't have to describe their emotions.

1233
00:52:26,663 --> 00:52:30,205
I mean, there are authorities on that, but sometimes

1234
00:52:30,205 --> 00:52:31,446
hindsight's not so great.

1235
00:52:31,446 --> 00:52:33,468
So we just kept going back to the tape, really.

1236
00:52:33,468 --> 00:52:37,170
And sometimes I think we go back to them and ask a

1237
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:37,651
question.

1238
00:52:38,306 --> 00:52:38,766
Like you see-

1239
00:52:38,766 --> 00:52:39,566
Yeah, clarify the question.

1240
00:52:39,566 --> 00:52:40,306
Like, why did you do that?

1241
00:52:40,306 --> 00:52:42,507
Like, you watch this, and this was kind of a problem,

1242
00:52:42,507 --> 00:52:43,527
and why did you do this?

1243
00:52:43,527 --> 00:52:44,847
Did you not understand the rule?

1244
00:52:44,847 --> 00:52:46,668
And they'd be like, oh, right, and-

1245
00:52:46,668 --> 00:52:48,548
But no survey type kinds of things.

1246
00:52:48,548 --> 00:52:49,429
Like, did you enjoy that?

1247
00:52:49,429 --> 00:52:50,649
Or, you know, what was your favorite part

1248
00:52:50,649 --> 00:52:51,489
or anything like that?

1249
00:52:51,489 --> 00:52:53,890
It's all, yeah, just the tape.

1250
00:52:53,890 --> 00:52:55,350
It's a lot of video to watch.

1251
00:52:55,350 --> 00:52:55,650
We get a lot.

1252
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:59,031
And we, you know, we can, yeah, we can watch who won.

1253
00:52:59,031 --> 00:53:02,071
Okay, first epidemic, second epidemic, finished the round.

1254
00:53:02,071 --> 00:53:03,912
Oh, they forgot this rule.

1255
00:53:03,912 --> 00:53:05,552
Like, it's, a lot of those notes

1256
00:53:05,552 --> 00:53:07,413
are just watching play by play.

1257
00:53:07,713 --> 00:53:12,097
the sort of things that you would have gotten from like a survey where we were looking for data.

1258
00:53:12,097 --> 00:53:12,157
Hey.

1259
00:53:12,157 --> 00:53:13,838
Hey. You guys made a good game. Thank you. But it's a game designed to be

1260
00:53:13,838 --> 00:53:21,004
played one time. So my question is, to what degree were you worried about people

1261
00:53:21,004 --> 00:53:26,969
being spoiled either through let's plays or just assholes

1262
00:53:26,969 --> 00:53:29,712
and not wanting to play the game anymore?

1263
00:53:30,629 --> 00:53:32,410
A bit.

1264
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:33,270
Well, I don't know.

1265
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:33,851
A bit, right?

1266
00:53:33,851 --> 00:53:34,851
There's always a concern.

1267
00:53:34,851 --> 00:53:37,292
With Risk Legacy, I was like, how much are people going to spoil it?

1268
00:53:37,292 --> 00:53:41,195
And then I discovered that the gaming community just went, oh, here's a game with spoilers.

1269
00:53:41,195 --> 00:53:41,375
Cool.

1270
00:53:41,375 --> 00:53:42,755
And then just didn't spoil it.

1271
00:53:42,755 --> 00:53:44,876
And I was like, whoa.

1272
00:53:44,876 --> 00:53:46,697
I mean, if you go looking, you could find it.

1273
00:53:46,697 --> 00:53:48,858
The publisher, Z-Man, was brilliant.

1274
00:53:48,858 --> 00:53:54,521
They turned it into an event by having it come out worldwide on the same day.

1275
00:53:55,073 --> 00:53:58,515
in every country to minimize, like the United States gets it first,

1276
00:53:58,515 --> 00:54:00,616
and then they write reviews, then you're reading about it,

1277
00:54:00,616 --> 00:54:02,497
and you're like, I would have bought it, but it spoiled it

1278
00:54:02,497 --> 00:54:04,718
in the review, and I didn't want to do that.

1279
00:54:04,718 --> 00:54:09,440
So Essen Game Fair in Germany is a big game fair in October,

1280
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:12,401
and it came out the first day of that, but it was in New Zealand

1281
00:54:12,401 --> 00:54:15,883
and California, and I think Russia lagged a couple weeks.

1282
00:54:15,883 --> 00:54:19,164
But other than that, so yeah, that was the way to avoid that.

1283
00:54:19,164 --> 00:54:21,345
You don't play it once, you play it 18 times.

1284
00:54:21,345 --> 00:54:23,226
Fair enough.

1285
00:54:23,226 --> 00:54:23,686
Okay.

1286
00:54:24,932 --> 00:54:28,578
I also have a spoiler question related to spoilers as a concept.

1287
00:54:28,578 --> 00:54:31,984
What's the statute of limitations for you guys giving a talk where you're like, all

1288
00:54:31,984 --> 00:54:36,532
right, we're going crazy, we're talking about every beat of the game, when are, you know,

1289
00:54:36,532 --> 00:54:38,896
when are we going to get that full spoiler talk, if ever?

1290
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:40,221
Tomorrow?

1291
00:54:40,221 --> 00:54:40,421
I don't know.

1292
00:54:40,421 --> 00:54:40,481
I, I'm.

1293
00:54:40,481 --> 00:54:44,204
Cause I mean, like we all know Darth Vader's Luke Skywalker's

1294
00:54:44,204 --> 00:54:46,405
father, like, sorry, sorry guys.

1295
00:54:46,405 --> 00:54:47,706
What?

1296
00:54:47,706 --> 00:54:49,948
So like, so, you know, but there's not,

1297
00:54:49,948 --> 00:54:51,669
you're so this, these are sort of the first games

1298
00:54:51,669 --> 00:54:53,310
with spoilers, board games with spoilers.

1299
00:54:53,310 --> 00:54:55,792
So, you know, what do you think that it's going to be?

1300
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:58,174
More honest question is probably pretty soon.

1301
00:54:58,174 --> 00:55:00,735
And most people here like have played it.

1302
00:55:00,735 --> 00:55:03,297
And hopefully when we talked about act one twists

1303
00:55:03,297 --> 00:55:05,179
and act two twists, you know what we were talking about

1304
00:55:05,179 --> 00:55:07,500
but just to save it from the people who had heard about it.

1305
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:12,602
and wanted to play it, but I'm guessing sometime in the next year I will talk about season

1306
00:55:12,602 --> 00:55:17,063
one much more honestly, and then season two, you know, we'll be out and we won't talk about

1307
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:18,604
that.

1308
00:55:18,604 --> 00:55:22,325
When I do podcasts now, like, there's usually a point where like, okay, now you just, and

1309
00:55:22,325 --> 00:55:25,827
then I'll get into the spoilers, like give people a chance to not listen.

1310
00:55:25,827 --> 00:55:29,628
But it's still selling well and still reaching new people.

1311
00:55:29,628 --> 00:55:33,490
Like if it was out of print, I'd talk about it all day long because it didn't run its

1312
00:55:33,490 --> 00:55:33,870
course.

1313
00:55:33,870 --> 00:55:34,230
Thank you.

1314
00:55:35,774 --> 00:55:40,747
Did you make any special considerations when designing for the varying player counts, so

1315
00:55:40,747 --> 00:55:44,217
like the game can play a little differently at two players than at four, for example?

1316
00:55:45,233 --> 00:55:45,614
It's a pen.

1317
00:55:45,614 --> 00:55:47,375
I don't think we did actually.

1318
00:55:47,375 --> 00:55:49,616
I mean, at first it was gonna be a three to four player game

1319
00:55:49,616 --> 00:55:51,798
but then we realized it's a great couples game

1320
00:55:51,798 --> 00:55:54,140
because it's easy to feel the team.

1321
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:56,141
It is a little easier with two players.

1322
00:55:56,141 --> 00:55:59,143
You can play it with two characters each if you want

1323
00:55:59,143 --> 00:56:01,685
but no, we just, we kept it simple.

1324
00:56:01,685 --> 00:56:03,686
So yeah, you can play right out of the box

1325
00:56:03,686 --> 00:56:05,788
just like you might play Pandemic with fewer characters.

1326
00:56:05,788 --> 00:56:07,269
So. Cool, thank you.

1327
00:56:07,269 --> 00:56:09,490
Part of the reason for that is Pandemic had been tested

1328
00:56:09,490 --> 00:56:11,351
with two to four and also we didn't feel like

1329
00:56:11,351 --> 00:56:13,273
giving ourselves any additional design challenges

1330
00:56:13,273 --> 00:56:14,053
by having.

1331
00:56:14,433 --> 00:56:16,394
different rules for the player count.

1332
00:56:16,394 --> 00:56:17,135
Yeah.

1333
00:56:17,135 --> 00:56:17,995
Multiplied over 15 games.

1334
00:56:17,995 --> 00:56:19,476
The complexity didn't really have the payoff.

1335
00:56:19,476 --> 00:56:19,516
OK.

1336
00:56:19,516 --> 00:56:20,797
So we got two more questions.

1337
00:56:20,797 --> 00:56:22,978
And we got four more minutes.

1338
00:56:22,978 --> 00:56:25,239
Before we take the questions, just

1339
00:56:25,239 --> 00:56:27,500
want to remind people to fill out your evaluations.

1340
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:29,120
You can tell I was a teacher at one point.

1341
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:32,522
Fill out your evaluations so that the GDC

1342
00:56:32,522 --> 00:56:36,044
has a sense of how this new board game talk

1343
00:56:36,044 --> 00:56:37,805
branch is going for future years.

1344
00:56:39,199 --> 00:56:45,164
Yes, I was wondering if you could speak to a moment about the your sort of difference in experience between balancing a competitive legacy

1345
00:56:45,164 --> 00:56:48,026
game and a cooperative legacy game in particular how that was

1346
00:56:48,026 --> 00:56:55,131
Balancing against for lack of a better term in AI versus balancing between actual other players. You should probably take that

1347
00:56:55,131 --> 00:56:56,772
Yeah, so in in risk legacy

1348
00:56:56,772 --> 00:57:02,816
I made the assumption which worked most of the time but not all the time if player a kept winning and they were getting bonuses

1349
00:57:02,816 --> 00:57:08,520
Which led to them winning more than players B through D would gang up on them and bring them back to the herd

1350
00:57:09,358 --> 00:57:12,040
And because the game goes in so many different directions,

1351
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:14,802
I needed the players to act as policing agents.

1352
00:57:14,802 --> 00:57:16,843
Where that fell down is when groups are like, well,

1353
00:57:16,843 --> 00:57:18,664
it didn't feel right to pick on that person,

1354
00:57:18,664 --> 00:57:20,806
so they just kept winning.

1355
00:57:20,806 --> 00:57:22,687
And then the game would go off the rails.

1356
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:24,208
So I knew that lesson coming in here.

1357
00:57:24,208 --> 00:57:25,529
But we really did have this fear,

1358
00:57:25,529 --> 00:57:27,630
and we spent time at the beginning talking about it,

1359
00:57:27,630 --> 00:57:30,832
of like, you're on the ground in the fetal position.

1360
00:57:30,832 --> 00:57:32,854
The game's just kicking you game after game.

1361
00:57:32,854 --> 00:57:35,695
Like, you know, like, you're just like, well, you're just.

1362
00:57:35,695 --> 00:57:37,337
And it turns out that that.

1363
00:57:39,098 --> 00:57:43,320
Funding worked and solved like 90% of our problems in that point.

1364
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:50,003
And, you know, like allowing you to pick two things at the end of every game that would

1365
00:57:50,003 --> 00:57:54,805
help you in the next game, and if you lost the game, you get a free game to try it again,

1366
00:57:54,805 --> 00:58:00,168
gives you two more things than if you had won the game, if that makes sense, were just

1367
00:58:00,168 --> 00:58:01,348
about enough to kind of work.

1368
00:58:01,348 --> 00:58:05,790
But it was a lot of fingers crossed and then watching the playtest and never seeing it.

1369
00:58:05,790 --> 00:58:07,371
Or if it went off the rails, we knew why.

1370
00:58:08,341 --> 00:58:08,922
Thank you.

1371
00:58:08,922 --> 00:58:12,286
So really quickly, talk about materials, if you would.

1372
00:58:12,286 --> 00:58:14,950
All these play tests, hundreds of play tests.

1373
00:58:15,708 --> 00:58:18,689
Did corporate pay for all these stickers

1374
00:58:18,689 --> 00:58:19,989
and tearing up cards and everything?

1375
00:58:19,989 --> 00:58:22,910
And what would your advice be for the garage developer?

1376
00:58:22,910 --> 00:58:24,971
Trying to do nice things.

1377
00:58:24,971 --> 00:58:28,972
We both work out of our homes as garage developers.

1378
00:58:28,972 --> 00:58:30,492
No, we just built it ourselves.

1379
00:58:30,492 --> 00:58:33,913
Like when we have to send out four prototypes,

1380
00:58:33,913 --> 00:58:36,054
towards the end when you have the full kit,

1381
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:38,294
we make like actual dossiers, my wife.

1382
00:58:38,294 --> 00:58:40,135
God bless her.

1383
00:58:40,135 --> 00:58:45,397
Hand cuts perforations into the dossiers.

1384
00:58:46,957 --> 00:58:48,379
I'm more of a scorer.

1385
00:58:48,379 --> 00:58:50,340
She's like an arts and crafts person.

1386
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:51,982
They're very time consuming.

1387
00:58:51,982 --> 00:58:53,163
There are some tricks.

1388
00:58:53,163 --> 00:58:54,885
I mean, early on I would print out stickers

1389
00:58:54,885 --> 00:58:56,967
and put them on actual cards.

1390
00:58:56,967 --> 00:58:58,969
We used a lot, we got in a lot of pandemic sets

1391
00:58:58,969 --> 00:59:00,730
and actually used those card backs.

1392
00:59:00,730 --> 00:59:02,492
For season two, it was almost exclusively card sleeves

1393
00:59:02,492 --> 00:59:06,056
because they're much easier to change out.

1394
00:59:06,056 --> 00:59:08,097
There's a lot of print on demand services,

1395
00:59:08,097 --> 00:59:09,939
but we don't typically do that

1396
00:59:09,939 --> 00:59:11,821
because the iteration cycle's too long.

1397
00:59:12,577 --> 00:59:14,637
And yeah, a lot of money as well.

1398
00:59:14,637 --> 00:59:15,077
So I don't know.

1399
00:59:15,077 --> 00:59:15,137
It's 10.59.

1400
00:59:15,137 --> 00:59:17,198
And the two of you sort of came up.

1401
00:59:17,198 --> 00:59:17,878
What?

1402
00:59:17,878 --> 00:59:18,338
He was first.

1403
00:59:18,338 --> 00:59:22,100
OK, if you've got a five second question, we can give

1404
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,920
you a five second answer.

1405
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:25,301
Thanks for the talk, by the way.

1406
00:59:25,301 --> 00:59:27,161
Just had a question.

1407
00:59:27,161 --> 00:59:31,082
Did you guys consider doing stuff like cross-campaigning,

1408
00:59:31,082 --> 00:59:33,743
like two groups of players influencing the same board or

1409
00:59:33,743 --> 00:59:35,304
some stuff like that?

1410
00:59:35,304 --> 00:59:36,244
Yeah, we like a challenge.

1411
00:59:37,133 --> 00:59:41,278
I've thought about that.

1412
00:59:41,278 --> 00:59:46,445
People come up to me with like, okay, now that you've mastered this, how can we raise

1413
00:59:46,445 --> 00:59:47,226
the stakes?

1414
00:59:47,226 --> 00:59:48,307
It's entertaining.

1415
00:59:48,307 --> 00:59:49,068
But we haven't planned it.

1416
00:59:49,068 --> 00:59:49,248
So, okay.

1417
00:59:49,248 --> 00:59:49,889
Thank you.

1418
00:59:49,889 --> 00:59:50,230
Thanks.

1419
00:59:50,230 --> 00:59:50,410
Thanks.
