1
00:00:05,142 --> 00:00:07,242
Thanks a lot for the creators of Killer Queen Arcade,

2
00:00:07,242 --> 00:00:09,803
my friends Nick Mikros and Josh DeBonis.

3
00:00:09,803 --> 00:00:13,645
And also special thank yous to fellow KQ players and fans,

4
00:00:13,645 --> 00:00:17,866
Dylan Higgins, Charles Pratt, Josh Eklo, Tiana Tan,

5
00:00:17,866 --> 00:00:20,667
Joe Pollard, Christopher Pressinger,

6
00:00:20,667 --> 00:00:23,388
Eric Clarkson for helping me put together this talk.

7
00:00:23,388 --> 00:00:26,029
And of course, thank you to the rest of the KQ community.

8
00:00:26,029 --> 00:00:26,729
You guys are amazing.

9
00:00:28,658 --> 00:00:30,159
So, who am I?

10
00:00:30,159 --> 00:00:33,463
I am currently the producer at Funktronic Labs

11
00:00:33,463 --> 00:00:35,024
in LA Game Studio.

12
00:00:35,024 --> 00:00:36,966
But more importantly, for this talk,

13
00:00:36,966 --> 00:00:41,071
I was previously the COO of Bumble Bear Games

14
00:00:41,071 --> 00:00:42,112
from 2015 to 2017.

15
00:00:43,433 --> 00:00:45,955
And today, I will be talking about Killer Queen Arcade

16
00:00:45,955 --> 00:00:49,597
and how we built a competitive community that spans the entire country as an indie

17
00:00:49,597 --> 00:00:51,619
and what you can learn from what we've done.

18
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:56,242
This isn't a post-mortem on the game or the community,

19
00:00:56,242 --> 00:00:59,484
but rather a breakdown of a lot of the things that Bumble Bear has done

20
00:00:59,484 --> 00:01:04,888
that I think that can be helpful for other competitive gaming communities to learn from, indie or not.

21
00:01:07,095 --> 00:01:10,296
So, Killer Queen Arcade, for those of you who don't know,

22
00:01:10,296 --> 00:01:13,157
is a five-on-five arcade game created by Josh DeBonis

23
00:01:13,157 --> 00:01:14,077
and Nick Micros in 2013.

24
00:01:14,077 --> 00:01:18,199
Two teams of five players compete against each other

25
00:01:18,199 --> 00:01:20,059
to be the first to accomplish one of three

26
00:01:20,059 --> 00:01:22,840
different victory conditions on a map.

27
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,041
An economic victory by collecting 12 berries

28
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:26,902
scattered around a map and bringing them back

29
00:01:26,902 --> 00:01:28,983
to your hive one at a time.

30
00:01:28,983 --> 00:01:31,444
A military victory by killing the opposing queen

31
00:01:31,444 --> 00:01:32,784
three times in a single game.

32
00:01:34,268 --> 00:01:36,309
or a snail victory by riding a snail

33
00:01:36,309 --> 00:01:37,889
into your own team's goal.

34
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:40,751
There's a video here that I've linked

35
00:01:40,751 --> 00:01:43,512
that goes into a lot more detail about the game itself.

36
00:01:43,512 --> 00:01:46,533
There's a lot of other mechanics to the game.

37
00:01:46,533 --> 00:01:48,374
For example, there is a queen character

38
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:50,355
who is different than the other four players.

39
00:01:50,355 --> 00:01:51,835
Workers can become warriors.

40
00:01:51,835 --> 00:01:53,996
There's a speed gate.

41
00:01:53,996 --> 00:01:56,237
So I highly encourage you to watch that video later

42
00:01:56,237 --> 00:01:57,598
if you get the chance.

43
00:01:58,717 --> 00:02:02,961
In roughly half a decade, Killer Queen Arcade has gone from a niche New York arcade game

44
00:02:02,961 --> 00:02:06,505
for hipsters to a niche national arcade game for hipsters.

45
00:02:06,505 --> 00:02:14,234
Today there are over 30 arcade machines available for public play in over 20 states, not counting

46
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:17,578
the many privately owned cabs that are owned by individuals and corporations.

47
00:02:19,261 --> 00:02:21,403
Every year since 2016, Bumble Bear Games

48
00:02:21,403 --> 00:02:23,764
has organized the National Killer Queen Arcade World

49
00:02:23,764 --> 00:02:27,027
Championship, which is hosted in a different city every year,

50
00:02:27,027 --> 00:02:29,789
bringing in players from around the country

51
00:02:29,789 --> 00:02:33,131
to play to see who is the best team.

52
00:02:33,131 --> 00:02:35,453
In 2016 in Austin, Texas, we had 150 players

53
00:02:35,453 --> 00:02:38,435
come to form over 30 teams.

54
00:02:38,435 --> 00:02:41,397
And last year in 2018, we had Bumble Bash 3,

55
00:02:41,397 --> 00:02:45,300
which was in Portland, Oregon, with 300 players and 60 teams.

56
00:02:46,642 --> 00:02:49,703
And recently, it was just announced that for 2019,

57
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:53,585
we are going to be in Chattanooga, Tennessee.

58
00:02:53,585 --> 00:02:56,026
So how does Killer Queen build communities?

59
00:02:56,026 --> 00:02:58,127
And more importantly, how can you apply this

60
00:02:58,127 --> 00:02:59,907
to your own game and to your own communities?

61
00:02:59,907 --> 00:03:03,209
So game design builds community.

62
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:06,250
Killer Queen is designed to bring people together

63
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:06,670
at its core.

64
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,271
To even play the game,

65
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:11,012
you need to physically be near a machine.

66
00:03:11,012 --> 00:03:13,033
You have to play together to win as a team.

67
00:03:13,033 --> 00:03:14,614
You can't win by yourself.

68
00:03:14,614 --> 00:03:16,495
Well, you can, but it's pretty hard to.

69
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:20,133
Local multiplayer means that you have to stand next to your teammates,

70
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:22,676
and you also have to be in the same space with your competitors too.

71
00:03:22,676 --> 00:03:25,740
And since you're all in the same place together doing the same thing,

72
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:29,284
you are by definition part of the same community.

73
00:03:29,284 --> 00:03:32,327
The game itself takes all five minutes to learn the basic rules,

74
00:03:32,327 --> 00:03:35,091
but it requires a lot of practice to work together effectively

75
00:03:35,091 --> 00:03:36,272
in order to play competitively.

76
00:03:37,763 --> 00:03:39,225
We also have messaging in the game

77
00:03:39,225 --> 00:03:41,608
that tells players to meet thy neighbors.

78
00:03:41,608 --> 00:03:43,250
This message occurs at the end of the match

79
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,472
and encourages players to meet with each other,

80
00:03:45,472 --> 00:03:47,514
give high fives, congratulatory handshakes,

81
00:03:47,514 --> 00:03:49,296
talk about that match they just played,

82
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:51,799
or even switch players to start a new game.

83
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:54,262
It's also possible to add custom messages on the screen

84
00:03:54,262 --> 00:03:56,284
to talk about things like upcoming tournaments,

85
00:03:56,284 --> 00:03:57,906
free plays, meetups, and so forth.

86
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,801
So what can you learn from this?

87
00:04:00,801 --> 00:04:02,562
Think about how the design of your game

88
00:04:02,562 --> 00:04:03,883
or the nature of your game itself

89
00:04:03,883 --> 00:04:06,805
facilitates building a community or building teams.

90
00:04:06,805 --> 00:04:08,146
Have a built-in messaging system

91
00:04:08,146 --> 00:04:09,647
can give subtle messages to players

92
00:04:09,647 --> 00:04:11,608
on how to behave while playing your game,

93
00:04:11,608 --> 00:04:14,890
as well as informing players about the larger community.

94
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,171
If you're looking for other models

95
00:04:16,171 --> 00:04:17,672
of local competitive communities,

96
00:04:17,672 --> 00:04:19,913
look at collectible car games and fighting game communities

97
00:04:19,913 --> 00:04:21,874
or rec leagues like dodgeball and softball.

98
00:04:21,874 --> 00:04:23,776
See how they build their communities

99
00:04:23,776 --> 00:04:26,077
and see what they do to keep players engaged

100
00:04:26,077 --> 00:04:27,178
outside of playing the game.

101
00:04:29,372 --> 00:04:31,353
Streaming and casting help build community.

102
00:04:31,353 --> 00:04:34,174
A lot of the KQ events will stream their games online

103
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:37,635
to let people watch from wherever they are.

104
00:04:37,635 --> 00:04:39,815
The KQ Arcade cabinet has a separate HDMI port

105
00:04:39,815 --> 00:04:41,556
built into the back of the cab.

106
00:04:41,556 --> 00:04:43,536
You can use either plug into a streaming PC

107
00:04:43,536 --> 00:04:46,257
to put the video online through Twitch

108
00:04:46,257 --> 00:04:48,057
or your streaming platform of your choice,

109
00:04:48,057 --> 00:04:49,998
or you can put it to a TV or a projector.

110
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,478
You can also split that HDMI signal

111
00:04:51,478 --> 00:04:52,979
to put out to multiple streams,

112
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:54,299
multiple projectors, and so forth.

113
00:04:55,077 --> 00:04:56,999
For bigger tournaments such as Bumble Bash,

114
00:04:56,999 --> 00:04:59,061
we'll also use apps like Restream.io,

115
00:04:59,061 --> 00:05:00,842
which will allow us to show a single stream

116
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,083
on multiple platforms,

117
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:04,866
or splice multiple machine feeds into one stream.

118
00:05:04,866 --> 00:05:07,908
As you can see in the image over here,

119
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:10,891
the community has created custom overlays

120
00:05:10,891 --> 00:05:13,253
that show the feed of the game,

121
00:05:13,253 --> 00:05:15,055
a player cam, commentator cam,

122
00:05:15,055 --> 00:05:18,117
as well as showing numbers of sets being won.

123
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:20,219
I think this one has kill and death ratios

124
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:21,120
at the bottom also.

125
00:05:22,266 --> 00:05:26,055
This is another example of the one that we had at Bumble Bash in Portland.

126
00:05:28,108 --> 00:05:31,129
In addition, we also have an API that sends out event data,

127
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:34,150
such as kills, deaths, and berries collected.

128
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,571
Some scenes have taken that data

129
00:05:35,571 --> 00:05:37,711
and created their own stat displays.

130
00:05:37,711 --> 00:05:41,012
So this is an example of one website that has stat tracking

131
00:05:41,012 --> 00:05:42,733
as well as logging event data

132
00:05:42,733 --> 00:05:44,133
based on where you are on the map.

133
00:05:44,133 --> 00:05:47,715
This uses a Raspberry Pi that gets plugged into the cab

134
00:05:47,715 --> 00:05:50,175
and then sends this data to a website.

135
00:05:50,175 --> 00:05:51,596
This website is actually live right now

136
00:05:51,596 --> 00:05:53,216
if you go to bmorekq.com.

137
00:05:53,216 --> 00:05:56,257
Shout outs to the Baltimore KQ community

138
00:05:56,257 --> 00:05:57,378
for putting this together.

139
00:06:00,403 --> 00:06:02,045
So yeah, build in streaming tools

140
00:06:02,045 --> 00:06:04,786
and make it easy to do things like organize tournaments

141
00:06:04,786 --> 00:06:06,467
and show information about your game

142
00:06:06,467 --> 00:06:08,309
and broadcast all of it so that it could be seen

143
00:06:08,309 --> 00:06:11,050
in the best light online and help raise your game's profile.

144
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,092
Spectators can digest what's going on

145
00:06:13,092 --> 00:06:15,753
with the help of color commentators and stat displays

146
00:06:15,753 --> 00:06:17,034
so they can get into your game

147
00:06:17,034 --> 00:06:20,436
without having to actually play the game or even be there.

148
00:06:20,436 --> 00:06:22,157
If you can't provide the tools yourself,

149
00:06:22,157 --> 00:06:24,079
see if you can open up your data for the community

150
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:26,720
to help you with displaying it.

151
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:30,551
provide instructions for folks on how to use all of this stuff.

152
00:06:30,551 --> 00:06:32,492
A lot of your fans may not be very technical,

153
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:33,553
but if you have very clear instructions,

154
00:06:33,553 --> 00:06:37,215
they may be able to figure it out themselves.

155
00:06:37,215 --> 00:06:39,037
Down here is a link to a GitHub repo.

156
00:06:39,037 --> 00:06:42,619
If you want to see an example of the API being used,

157
00:06:42,619 --> 00:06:44,280
this is an app called KQStats.

158
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,483
This was done by Kevin Snyder, as well as a few other folks,

159
00:06:48,483 --> 00:06:49,704
so thank you for doing that.

160
00:06:51,484 --> 00:06:52,944
Events help build communities.

161
00:06:52,944 --> 00:06:56,245
Bumble Bear hosts its national tournament with a trophy

162
00:06:56,245 --> 00:06:57,406
and a custom marquee that it gives

163
00:06:57,406 --> 00:06:59,186
to the winner of a tournament.

164
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:01,587
Local scenes also host their regular events also.

165
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:04,988
Because these arcade machines are already in public venues,

166
00:07:04,988 --> 00:07:07,008
we try to partner with them to host events.

167
00:07:07,008 --> 00:07:09,289
So you'll see KQ tournaments and events in bars,

168
00:07:09,289 --> 00:07:12,230
bowling alleys, family fun centers, arcades, barcades,

169
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,410
and even in board game shops.

170
00:07:14,853 --> 00:07:16,614
For tournament play, two commonly used apps

171
00:07:16,614 --> 00:07:19,296
that are used to help organize and manage the tournaments

172
00:07:19,296 --> 00:07:20,897
are SmashGG and Challenge.

173
00:07:20,897 --> 00:07:23,579
We can use these apps to help players register ahead of time,

174
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:26,821
set up pools and brackets, and post results in real time

175
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:27,962
online for players to look at.

176
00:07:27,962 --> 00:07:30,684
In addition to doing competitive events,

177
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:32,885
another kind of event to get players

178
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:35,687
interested in playing the game without explicitly focusing

179
00:07:35,687 --> 00:07:36,468
on competitive play.

180
00:07:36,908 --> 00:07:39,269
is to do theme competitions or fundraisers

181
00:07:39,269 --> 00:07:40,969
for organizations such as Extra Life.

182
00:07:40,969 --> 00:07:43,690
Despite the fact that KQ is a competitive team game,

183
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:46,070
scenes have created less competitive events,

184
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,671
such as scrambles, where teams are drawn from a hat,

185
00:07:48,671 --> 00:07:50,891
social nights, draft nights,

186
00:07:50,891 --> 00:07:53,092
where queens take turns picking players,

187
00:07:53,092 --> 00:07:55,632
and we have our own version of Battle Royale called Bub G.

188
00:07:55,632 --> 00:07:58,573
Silly things like theme or costume events

189
00:07:58,573 --> 00:08:01,834
like a winter formal create a much more informal environment

190
00:08:01,834 --> 00:08:03,354
and lets people focus on having fun

191
00:08:03,354 --> 00:08:04,534
with and around the game.

192
00:08:07,425 --> 00:08:11,166
So yeah, events build a community, not the other way around.

193
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:12,666
Organize events as soon as you can.

194
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:15,506
The first Killer Queen National Tournament was in 2016,

195
00:08:15,506 --> 00:08:17,327
but there were tournaments and meetups held

196
00:08:17,327 --> 00:08:18,827
by the community long before that.

197
00:08:18,827 --> 00:08:21,028
If you feel that your community wants one,

198
00:08:21,028 --> 00:08:23,628
then create one, or if you can't for whatever reason,

199
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:24,969
help them out in any way you can.

200
00:08:24,969 --> 00:08:27,749
The event itself doesn't have to be a tournament.

201
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:30,670
It can be a playtest, a mixer, a meetup.

202
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,590
Just do it often and do it frequently.

203
00:08:33,271 --> 00:08:35,672
Don't worry about failure or an event being bad.

204
00:08:35,672 --> 00:08:37,734
You're not trying to plan a fire festival.

205
00:08:37,734 --> 00:08:39,055
You're just giving players a chance.

206
00:08:39,055 --> 00:08:43,317
You're just giving players a chance to play together

207
00:08:43,317 --> 00:08:44,658
in a somewhat organized fashion.

208
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:47,060
If you do make mistakes, just learn from them

209
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,180
and do better next time.

210
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,602
I'll talk a little bit more about online events

211
00:08:50,602 --> 00:08:52,163
in another slide.

212
00:08:52,163 --> 00:08:53,323
But creating online tournaments

213
00:08:53,323 --> 00:08:55,065
and having everyone meet in a Discord

214
00:08:55,065 --> 00:08:57,046
is a great way to do an event without the need

215
00:08:57,046 --> 00:08:58,767
of having everyone to be in the same place.

216
00:08:59,848 --> 00:09:04,112
One interesting point about planning events is the importance of consistency.

217
00:09:04,112 --> 00:09:10,017
In New York, there is an event every single Friday at NYU in Brooklyn called 5v5 Fridays.

218
00:09:10,017 --> 00:09:12,820
It's hosted by one of the professors, Charles J. Pratt.

219
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,683
He noticed that by being consistently every single Friday,

220
00:09:15,683 --> 00:09:18,545
players can always just show up whenever they have a free Friday

221
00:09:18,545 --> 00:09:21,768
as opposed to having to plan for the event that only happens once a month,

222
00:09:21,768 --> 00:09:24,030
which lessens the hassle of having to come to play the game.

223
00:09:24,611 --> 00:09:26,072
You'll have regulars that come there every week,

224
00:09:26,072 --> 00:09:27,272
but you'll also have access to people

225
00:09:27,272 --> 00:09:28,713
who may show up every two weeks,

226
00:09:28,713 --> 00:09:30,254
or maybe only just once a month.

227
00:09:30,254 --> 00:09:33,416
If you have an individual player-based game,

228
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:35,597
but you wanna have folks competing in events like teams,

229
00:09:35,597 --> 00:09:37,298
there are ways to organize that too.

230
00:09:37,298 --> 00:09:40,220
At Bumble Bash 3, we created an Olympic-style

231
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,061
scoring system called the Dang System

232
00:09:42,061 --> 00:09:43,822
that gave points per player.

233
00:09:43,822 --> 00:09:45,863
At the end of the tournament, we grouped players by region

234
00:09:45,863 --> 00:09:48,004
and added the points together of the top 17 players

235
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,245
of each region to determine the winner.

236
00:09:50,245 --> 00:09:52,467
The winning city got an arcade machine.

237
00:09:55,388 --> 00:09:57,828
Engaging with the community builds community.

238
00:09:57,828 --> 00:10:01,569
Bumble Bear travels across the country to KQ events

239
00:10:01,569 --> 00:10:03,310
to talk to players and fans and play with them.

240
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,870
Bumble Bear will also bring with them new maps,

241
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,351
new game modes to test out,

242
00:10:07,351 --> 00:10:09,691
and answer questions about Killer Queen.

243
00:10:09,691 --> 00:10:12,112
Every year there's also a state of Killer Queen announcement

244
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,912
where they talk about the upcoming roadmap and plans.

245
00:10:13,912 --> 00:10:19,074
And when I talk about engaging with the community,

246
00:10:19,074 --> 00:10:22,515
Nick and Josh really, really engage with the community.

247
00:10:23,988 --> 00:10:26,270
So this was recently at the South Florida,

248
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,571
there was a Kale Green event there.

249
00:10:27,571 --> 00:10:30,713
That's Nick in the, I think, hot tub being fed a steak.

250
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:30,873
So yeah.

251
00:10:35,429 --> 00:10:37,791
Travel to events to promote the game.

252
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,672
Make yourselves accessible to the community

253
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:41,653
for direct conversations and feedback,

254
00:10:41,653 --> 00:10:43,634
and engage only as much as you're comfortable.

255
00:10:43,634 --> 00:10:46,216
Attending community events legitimizes those events

256
00:10:46,216 --> 00:10:48,397
in the player's eyes and encourages people to attend

257
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:49,138
and builds goodwill.

258
00:10:49,138 --> 00:10:52,400
You should also do regular testing with your community.

259
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,261
Try out ideas.

260
00:10:53,261 --> 00:10:54,902
Keep good ones, throw away the rest.

261
00:10:54,902 --> 00:10:56,062
And even with your bad ideas,

262
00:10:56,062 --> 00:10:57,103
let your fans have fun with it,

263
00:10:57,103 --> 00:10:58,224
and you never know what would happen.

264
00:10:59,144 --> 00:11:00,686
We tried game modes all the time.

265
00:11:00,686 --> 00:11:02,487
For a long time, there was a mode in Killer Queen

266
00:11:02,487 --> 00:11:06,250
that had scorpions, which having scorpions

267
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,492
and bears and bees, I thought was a terrible idea,

268
00:11:09,492 --> 00:11:11,013
but people liked it and whatever.

269
00:11:11,013 --> 00:11:14,516
Keep the game fresh, it keeps the game fresh

270
00:11:14,516 --> 00:11:16,698
and people keep talking about it.

271
00:11:16,698 --> 00:11:18,059
Turn these tests into an event.

272
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:21,021
If you can't travel to other scenes, play online.

273
00:11:21,021 --> 00:11:23,283
Host and play with your fans and players once a week.

274
00:11:23,563 --> 00:11:28,788
do an AMA, blog, you can even do things like having regular tests where the highest scoring

275
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:33,092
player that week or month gets to challenge the designers and developers.

276
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:35,935
And whatever you do, put it online and stream it.

277
00:11:38,255 --> 00:11:41,476
If there's one thing that you should take away from this talk,

278
00:11:41,476 --> 00:11:44,357
it should be that aside from designing a very compelling and engaging game,

279
00:11:44,357 --> 00:11:48,979
Bumble Bear's accessibility and engagement with its very, very active community

280
00:11:48,979 --> 00:11:51,941
is a key factor to the success of Killer Queen.

281
00:11:51,941 --> 00:11:54,642
Being part of your community gives you the opportunity to get insight

282
00:11:54,642 --> 00:11:56,583
about what the community wants to see.

283
00:11:57,094 --> 00:11:59,275
as well as instills confidence that the developers

284
00:11:59,275 --> 00:12:00,717
will be able to shape the game into something

285
00:12:00,717 --> 00:12:01,657
that people will want to play.

286
00:12:01,657 --> 00:12:03,699
And even if Bumble Bear can't do it themselves,

287
00:12:03,699 --> 00:12:06,361
sometimes creating the opportunity for the community

288
00:12:06,361 --> 00:12:09,884
to help fill in those gaps can be still just as effective.

289
00:12:09,884 --> 00:12:11,786
Having said that, I don't want you to walk away

290
00:12:11,786 --> 00:12:13,828
from this talk thinking that Bumble Bear knocks it out

291
00:12:13,828 --> 00:12:15,089
of the park every single time.

292
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:17,351
At one point, we came up with the idea

293
00:12:17,351 --> 00:12:19,332
of establishing a membership-based

294
00:12:19,332 --> 00:12:20,693
National Killer Queen League.

295
00:12:21,277 --> 00:12:23,678
You pay a fee, you get some cool stuff out of it,

296
00:12:23,678 --> 00:12:25,480
and you help fund an organization dedicated

297
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,122
to managing a competitive National Killer Queen League.

298
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:32,225
I'm not gonna get into the details of what it all entailed,

299
00:12:32,225 --> 00:12:34,466
but long story short, it was not well received

300
00:12:34,466 --> 00:12:37,008
by the community for various reasons.

301
00:12:37,008 --> 00:12:38,810
This is one of the posts that was on the Facebook page

302
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:39,730
in response.

303
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:42,652
This was a situation where we got insight

304
00:12:42,652 --> 00:12:44,274
that the community wanted something,

305
00:12:44,274 --> 00:12:46,235
but we didn't create what they actually needed,

306
00:12:46,235 --> 00:12:48,297
and we executed very poorly.

307
00:12:48,297 --> 00:12:50,818
And as a result, the community told us how they felt.

308
00:12:51,982 --> 00:12:54,403
So we realized the idea wasn't quite the right fit,

309
00:12:54,403 --> 00:12:56,505
so we wound up shelving it.

310
00:12:56,505 --> 00:13:00,228
So merch and fan art built communities.

311
00:13:00,228 --> 00:13:01,209
Merch is merch.

312
00:13:01,209 --> 00:13:04,531
People like to buy merch to support the things they love.

313
00:13:04,531 --> 00:13:06,473
Originally, Bumble Beer had an Amazon store,

314
00:13:06,473 --> 00:13:08,594
but we decided to create our own storefront.

315
00:13:08,594 --> 00:13:10,196
We had issues with people making cheaper,

316
00:13:10,196 --> 00:13:11,897
counterfeit versions of our stuff

317
00:13:11,897 --> 00:13:13,258
and selling it on our product pages.

318
00:13:13,258 --> 00:13:15,600
So it was just easier for us to take our merchandise

319
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,581
completely off Amazon and just do our own thing.

320
00:13:18,225 --> 00:13:21,813
If you don't want to deal with your own inventory and stuff, and I don't blame you, there are

321
00:13:21,813 --> 00:13:24,559
companies that you can partner with, such as Fangamer or Sanshi.

322
00:13:27,258 --> 00:13:29,440
In addition to Bumble Bear created merch,

323
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,961
Bumble Bear encourages the community

324
00:13:30,961 --> 00:13:32,423
to create their own merch,

325
00:13:32,423 --> 00:13:35,145
and express themselves in the universe of Killer Queen.

326
00:13:35,145 --> 00:13:36,967
It gives the fans a chance to contribute

327
00:13:36,967 --> 00:13:38,649
to something that they already love.

328
00:13:38,649 --> 00:13:41,172
And our fans make some really amazing things.

329
00:13:41,172 --> 00:13:44,034
From picture frames, t-shirts, posters.

330
00:13:44,034 --> 00:13:45,856
I'm actually wearing a fan created shirt.

331
00:13:45,856 --> 00:13:47,898
This was done by one of the Chicago players,

332
00:13:47,898 --> 00:13:48,639
Michael Sparza.

333
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,982
And yeah, we have one rule for fan merch.

334
00:13:52,982 --> 00:13:55,223
Don't directly rip off the art from the game.

335
00:13:55,223 --> 00:13:56,964
It should be transformative.

336
00:13:56,964 --> 00:13:58,465
Reinterpret the art in your own way.

337
00:13:58,465 --> 00:14:02,066
So all these three things were created by our fans

338
00:14:02,066 --> 00:14:03,707
for either events or for teams.

339
00:14:03,707 --> 00:14:06,028
The calendar in the middle was actually

340
00:14:06,028 --> 00:14:08,310
a fundraising project for Girls Who Code.

341
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:12,792
Bumbleblair also makes our source assets available

342
00:14:12,792 --> 00:14:14,933
for fans to use, which I didn't think was a crazy thing

343
00:14:14,933 --> 00:14:16,594
until I told people and they thought I was crazy.

344
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,901
If you dig around the press kit,

345
00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:20,582
you will find player sprites,

346
00:14:20,582 --> 00:14:22,604
as well as some quality versions of our logo.

347
00:14:22,604 --> 00:14:24,525
And a lot of people will use these assets

348
00:14:24,525 --> 00:14:25,866
for the basis of fan art,

349
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:27,948
or for graphics to use for their posters, t-shirts,

350
00:14:27,948 --> 00:14:29,409
and all sorts of other things.

351
00:14:29,409 --> 00:14:31,930
The image on the right over here

352
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:34,212
is an example of someone using one of our sprites

353
00:14:34,212 --> 00:14:36,334
and customizing it for their posters.

354
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:37,995
All these other images here are fan art

355
00:14:37,995 --> 00:14:39,896
and event posters that the community has made.

356
00:14:39,896 --> 00:14:42,318
And you'll be very surprised that, you know,

357
00:14:42,318 --> 00:14:44,840
your fans may be able to make art better than you.

358
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:49,192
In addition to encouraging folks to create and sell

359
00:14:49,192 --> 00:14:52,415
fan-created merchandise, Bumble Bear takes it a step further

360
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,917
and will actually sell a community,

361
00:14:54,917 --> 00:14:57,259
or approved community-created merch on its own online store

362
00:14:57,259 --> 00:15:00,621
for a cut of the sale plus cost of shipping and handling.

363
00:15:00,621 --> 00:15:04,064
Those posters over here are created by,

364
00:15:04,064 --> 00:15:07,567
also I think a Chicago player, John Doon.

365
00:15:08,098 --> 00:15:09,760
and they're gorgeous and they're available

366
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,161
on the store right now if you wanna buy them.

367
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,443
We'll also do the same thing at events like Bumble Bash

368
00:15:14,443 --> 00:15:16,445
where we have a merch table where fans can sell

369
00:15:16,445 --> 00:15:17,826
their stuff there for a percentage cut.

370
00:15:17,826 --> 00:15:20,287
By keeping things to a merch table at events,

371
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:21,588
you can see all the kinds of cool things

372
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:23,350
that people are making and it keeps all the merch

373
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,691
selling in one area at a venue.

374
00:15:25,311 --> 00:15:28,316
The only other note I have is that you should be careful about tax laws,

375
00:15:28,316 --> 00:15:31,762
as you're conducting business in some states, and they may consider that vending,

376
00:15:31,762 --> 00:15:35,428
and therefore you have to deduct or collect sales tax for it.

377
00:15:35,428 --> 00:15:38,674
I'm not a lawyer, I'm not an accountant, I'm just letting you know ahead of time.

378
00:15:40,293 --> 00:15:43,514
So yeah, there are caveats to making your own merch,

379
00:15:43,514 --> 00:15:46,034
but like I said, there are companies that can do it for you.

380
00:15:46,034 --> 00:15:48,855
Either way, it's definitely something you should do.

381
00:15:48,855 --> 00:15:51,476
Encourage people to create fan art,

382
00:15:51,476 --> 00:15:53,356
do competitions, do contests with it.

383
00:15:53,356 --> 00:15:56,297
And if you're as crazy as Bumble Bear,

384
00:15:56,297 --> 00:15:58,317
sell merch actually created by your friends,

385
00:15:58,317 --> 00:15:59,198
or by your fans.

386
00:15:59,718 --> 00:16:02,982
And if you're worried about things like rip-offs and stuff like that,

387
00:16:02,982 --> 00:16:06,848
in my time at Bumble Bear, I found it very effective to tell people

388
00:16:06,848 --> 00:16:09,331
to have to make their art more transformative.

389
00:16:09,331 --> 00:16:12,355
It challenges them to make something better without saying no,

390
00:16:12,355 --> 00:16:14,498
and in the end, they're likely going to make something cool

391
00:16:14,498 --> 00:16:16,681
and something that you may not have thought about yourself.

392
00:16:19,064 --> 00:16:21,326
Sponsors can help build communities.

393
00:16:21,326 --> 00:16:24,047
In order for competitive communities to thrive,

394
00:16:24,047 --> 00:16:25,068
they need competitive events.

395
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:27,429
A healthy community has frequent events

396
00:16:27,429 --> 00:16:28,850
and you're gonna need to pay for all of that

397
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:31,211
and sometimes tournament entrance fees alone

398
00:16:31,211 --> 00:16:32,032
may not be enough.

399
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:35,254
Bumble Bear encourages people to host their own tournaments

400
00:16:35,254 --> 00:16:37,495
and to find their own sponsorships for these events.

401
00:16:37,495 --> 00:16:39,996
In general, Bumble Bear's opening to letting folks

402
00:16:39,996 --> 00:16:41,858
arrange their own events as long as it doesn't appear

403
00:16:41,858 --> 00:16:44,879
to look like it is an event endorsed or sponsored directly

404
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,580
by Bumble Bear or Killer Queen Arcade.

405
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:49,293
Killer Queen Arcade has also gotten to the point now

406
00:16:49,293 --> 00:16:50,734
we have been lucky enough to have the attention

407
00:16:50,734 --> 00:16:52,115
of some of the largest sponsors

408
00:16:52,115 --> 00:16:53,676
and marketing brands like Red Bull.

409
00:16:53,676 --> 00:16:55,137
It is through a lot of hard work from people

410
00:16:55,137 --> 00:16:56,959
within our community and within Bumble Bear

411
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,980
that has raised KQ's profile to this level.

412
00:17:00,665 --> 00:17:05,190
Because the game's located in a lot of bars, beer sponsors are a great sponsorship source for us.

413
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:09,194
These are two events, one in Portland and one in Minneapolis,

414
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,717
both sponsored by beer companies.

415
00:17:11,717 --> 00:17:14,380
I think Surly Brewing sponsors Minneapolis,

416
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:17,923
and Not Your Father's Root Beer sponsors Killer Queen Events in Portland.

417
00:17:20,769 --> 00:17:23,311
Before you actually pitch a sponsor for an event,

418
00:17:23,311 --> 00:17:25,113
here's some things you probably want to think about.

419
00:17:25,113 --> 00:17:26,974
How much control do you want to have

420
00:17:26,974 --> 00:17:28,876
over the portrayal of your game?

421
00:17:28,876 --> 00:17:30,497
How do you think the community will react?

422
00:17:30,497 --> 00:17:32,679
Is that something that's actually important for you?

423
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:35,681
Are you now sanctioning official events yourself?

424
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:37,503
And can there only be one event?

425
00:17:37,503 --> 00:17:39,244
What does that mean for non-sanctioned events?

426
00:17:39,244 --> 00:17:41,046
Are you, the game's creators,

427
00:17:41,046 --> 00:17:43,067
the only ones able to seek out sponsorships now?

428
00:17:43,067 --> 00:17:45,289
And what does an agreement look like

429
00:17:45,289 --> 00:17:46,890
between you and the sponsor?

430
00:17:47,091 --> 00:17:50,955
I added this image here just because there's a lot of text,

431
00:17:50,955 --> 00:17:54,039
but just as an example, this is Richie's Plank Experience,

432
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:56,001
which is a VR thing, and one of the cool things

433
00:17:56,001 --> 00:17:58,624
that they do is that they also will do sponsored versions

434
00:17:58,624 --> 00:18:00,026
of their VR experience.

435
00:18:00,026 --> 00:18:02,129
So I think this one's Fear Factor,

436
00:18:02,129 --> 00:18:04,091
the Richie's Plank Experience,

437
00:18:04,091 --> 00:18:05,132
and I thought that was really cool.

438
00:18:06,771 --> 00:18:08,292
So once you've thought about that,

439
00:18:08,292 --> 00:18:09,513
you'll want to look for sponsors

440
00:18:09,513 --> 00:18:11,655
that are most appropriate to your community.

441
00:18:11,655 --> 00:18:12,836
In addition to beer companies,

442
00:18:12,836 --> 00:18:15,298
there's a wide variety of gaming adjacent companies

443
00:18:15,298 --> 00:18:16,819
that are willing to sponsor game events.

444
00:18:16,819 --> 00:18:19,821
Food and beverage, which can include anything

445
00:18:19,821 --> 00:18:21,803
from snack distributors to local restaurants.

446
00:18:21,803 --> 00:18:25,225
Venues can help you also get a discount on rental costs.

447
00:18:25,225 --> 00:18:26,927
There are also a lot of people companies.

448
00:18:26,927 --> 00:18:28,468
There are companies that target people

449
00:18:28,468 --> 00:18:30,029
in the tech or tech-related field

450
00:18:30,029 --> 00:18:32,551
or always looking for marketing opportunities.

451
00:18:32,551 --> 00:18:33,712
Gaming hardware brands.

452
00:18:34,376 --> 00:18:38,539
and lifestyle brands that want to sell clothes and consumables and apparel to your players.

453
00:18:38,539 --> 00:18:43,462
If you partner with a bar or venue, oftentimes they'll have their own food and beverage marketing

454
00:18:43,462 --> 00:18:47,645
reps who are usually pretty interested and open to helping sponsor different events for

455
00:18:47,645 --> 00:18:48,045
that venue.

456
00:18:50,104 --> 00:18:53,667
In terms of the kinds of sponsorship opportunities available, there are a lot of options.

457
00:18:53,667 --> 00:18:59,691
Asking for money is one of the more difficult ones, but asking for merchandise and swag

458
00:18:59,691 --> 00:19:03,093
for use at the event or for giving away as prizes are much easier.

459
00:19:03,093 --> 00:19:06,395
I'm not going to read through this list.

460
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,836
It's pretty self-explanatory.

461
00:19:07,836 --> 00:19:09,177
You're at GDC.

462
00:19:09,177 --> 00:19:12,980
Just take a look around at the many different sponsors we have here at GDC and see how they

463
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,181
make their presence known.

464
00:19:14,181 --> 00:19:18,183
From the lanyards they're wearing to the free t-shirts to the hats that you get, or you'll

465
00:19:18,183 --> 00:19:19,304
probably get sometime this week.

466
00:19:21,194 --> 00:19:24,156
When pitching a sponsor, be sure to know the following.

467
00:19:24,156 --> 00:19:27,138
Your audience, attendee, demographic, and size.

468
00:19:27,138 --> 00:19:29,560
Where will this be broadcasted or streamed,

469
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,622
and what's the size and demographics of that?

470
00:19:31,622 --> 00:19:34,204
What else are people gonna be doing at this event?

471
00:19:34,204 --> 00:19:35,885
What's your social media reach?

472
00:19:35,885 --> 00:19:37,946
How will you be promoting your sponsors at the event?

473
00:19:38,547 --> 00:19:41,510
Any solid data that you might have for previous events

474
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,932
and similar events or even surveys

475
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:44,634
that you do with your community.

476
00:19:44,634 --> 00:19:46,656
And most importantly, what are sponsors

477
00:19:46,656 --> 00:19:48,538
going to be able to get out of your event?

478
00:19:48,538 --> 00:19:50,140
You wanna let them know that they're gonna gain

479
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,403
something positive out of the entire experience.

480
00:19:52,403 --> 00:19:54,285
That players and spectators alike

481
00:19:54,285 --> 00:19:56,147
will be able to take something positive

482
00:19:56,147 --> 00:19:58,089
from having that brand associated with your game.

483
00:20:00,202 --> 00:20:03,022
I say sponsorships can help people or can help communities

484
00:20:03,022 --> 00:20:05,363
because sometimes it can backfire.

485
00:20:05,363 --> 00:20:07,044
Maybe your brand isn't the kind of brand

486
00:20:07,044 --> 00:20:08,984
that likes to look like it's sold out.

487
00:20:08,984 --> 00:20:10,565
Maybe it does.

488
00:20:10,565 --> 00:20:11,865
And for those of you who don't know,

489
00:20:11,865 --> 00:20:14,306
this is from when Street Fighter V

490
00:20:14,306 --> 00:20:16,287
tried to do sponsored content skins

491
00:20:16,287 --> 00:20:18,107
and this didn't go over very well.

492
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,551
Social media builds communities.

493
00:20:22,551 --> 00:20:24,593
These are just some of the many Facebook pages

494
00:20:24,593 --> 00:20:26,555
our community has created for Killer Queen,

495
00:20:26,555 --> 00:20:28,697
and they're all divided by region.

496
00:20:28,697 --> 00:20:30,178
Facebook pages and groups allow fans

497
00:20:30,178 --> 00:20:32,020
to organize their lives outside of the game,

498
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,361
and they function as a way for players

499
00:20:33,361 --> 00:20:34,763
to organize themselves in real life.

500
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:38,735
It also helps the community support each other and stay connected when they're not playing

501
00:20:38,735 --> 00:20:39,135
your game.

502
00:20:39,135 --> 00:20:43,922
BumbleBear itself did not create any of these Facebook pages, but we are a part of most

503
00:20:43,922 --> 00:20:44,242
of these.

504
00:20:44,242 --> 00:20:47,847
It's another great way for us to engage our community, and it's always good to know what

505
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:50,731
your community is talking about, even if it's memes most of the time.

506
00:20:52,769 --> 00:20:54,790
So yeah, build your social media,

507
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,431
very important to build communities.

508
00:20:56,431 --> 00:20:58,271
I'm not gonna talk about this too much.

509
00:20:58,271 --> 00:21:00,912
There was a really cool talk yesterday about Discord.

510
00:21:00,912 --> 00:21:03,093
It's 2019, if you don't have a Slack, a Discord,

511
00:21:03,093 --> 00:21:06,234
or a Facebook page, and you're making a game,

512
00:21:06,234 --> 00:21:06,954
you're behind.

513
00:21:08,999 --> 00:21:11,000
Champions help build communities.

514
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,302
Find your super fans as you build your communities

515
00:21:13,302 --> 00:21:14,622
and enable them to be your champions.

516
00:21:14,622 --> 00:21:16,604
For Killer Queen, these were the ones

517
00:21:16,604 --> 00:21:18,305
who helped organize the first local tournaments

518
00:21:18,305 --> 00:21:19,545
in different cities.

519
00:21:19,545 --> 00:21:21,907
They were the ones that created all the cool merch

520
00:21:21,907 --> 00:21:23,908
that streamed our game, that did commentary,

521
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:25,469
that got new players into the game.

522
00:21:25,469 --> 00:21:27,510
We even created an award for this,

523
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,971
the Charles J. Pratt Community Service Award,

524
00:21:29,971 --> 00:21:33,773
which was won in the first year by Charles J. Pratt.

525
00:21:34,934 --> 00:21:36,036
But reward your champions.

526
00:21:36,036 --> 00:21:39,480
If you have an upcoming game, give them keys to give away.

527
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,825
Give them assets if they ask for them to make art and merch.

528
00:21:42,825 --> 00:21:44,407
Ask for their feedback.

529
00:21:44,407 --> 00:21:47,051
Ask for them to help organize an event,

530
00:21:47,051 --> 00:21:49,274
and ask them to help you promote your game to new fans.

531
00:21:50,135 --> 00:21:53,517
Another thing that we did at Bumble Bear was that we had a small committee of fans that

532
00:21:53,517 --> 00:21:56,119
we talked to about upcoming events and ideas.

533
00:21:56,119 --> 00:21:59,141
If you have an idea you want to do with the community, it's always good to have a small

534
00:21:59,141 --> 00:22:02,384
group of people to test it with first before you go forward with something.

535
00:22:02,384 --> 00:22:07,508
They can help embrace an idea or an event, they can help hype up the community, and in

536
00:22:07,508 --> 00:22:09,769
general they just help make good ideas great.

537
00:22:10,602 --> 00:22:13,547
Partnering with a streamer or YouTube was something

538
00:22:13,547 --> 00:22:15,209
that we always wanted to do,

539
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:16,551
but given the nature of our game,

540
00:22:16,551 --> 00:22:19,215
this makes it kind of difficult.

541
00:22:19,215 --> 00:22:20,757
Luckily, most of you aren't making arcade games,

542
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:23,822
so that shouldn't be an excuse for you guys.

543
00:22:23,822 --> 00:22:24,303
Or for you all.

544
00:22:25,228 --> 00:22:28,050
Other communities can help build your community.

545
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:30,151
Killer Queen attracts all sorts of players

546
00:22:30,151 --> 00:22:31,152
looking for competition.

547
00:22:31,152 --> 00:22:33,293
We have folks from the fighting game community,

548
00:22:33,293 --> 00:22:35,774
speed runners, recreational league, dodge ball,

549
00:22:35,774 --> 00:22:39,096
softball players, who are just attractive to competition

550
00:22:39,096 --> 00:22:40,137
and the competitiveness of KQ.

551
00:22:40,137 --> 00:22:43,318
It would be smart to engage or partner with other communities

552
00:22:43,318 --> 00:22:45,580
to cross-promote events and games.

553
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,441
At Bumble Bash, we will actually host games

554
00:22:47,441 --> 00:22:48,902
made by other indies.

555
00:22:48,902 --> 00:22:52,904
So the image here is a game called Death Ball Arcade

556
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:54,445
by Tony Halber, who's the one playing it.

557
00:22:55,158 --> 00:22:59,501
It's worth looking into other competitive gaming communities and think about the opportunity

558
00:22:59,501 --> 00:23:02,443
for collaboration on events or promotion.

559
00:23:02,443 --> 00:23:04,784
In this situation, I think a rising tide lifts all boats.

560
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,142
Formalized communication builds communities.

561
00:23:09,142 --> 00:23:10,883
Clear communication builds trust,

562
00:23:10,883 --> 00:23:13,466
prevents confusion and uncertainty about your game.

563
00:23:13,466 --> 00:23:14,527
State of the game announcements,

564
00:23:14,527 --> 00:23:16,829
public roadmaps, and blogs are all very important.

565
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:21,033
This is the Trello board for Killer Queen Black,

566
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:23,735
which is the upcoming Killer Queen title

567
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,236
coming out for the PC and Switch.

568
00:23:26,177 --> 00:23:27,358
please buy it when it comes out.

569
00:23:27,358 --> 00:23:29,919
They did a pretty good job of showing their work

570
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,800
with a public Trello, showing release notes,

571
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,121
upcoming development, outstanding work, and so forth.

572
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:36,523
With all forms of formal communication,

573
00:23:36,523 --> 00:23:38,984
keep it simple, straightforward, and consistent,

574
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:40,945
so it's not a pain in the butt to maintain.

575
00:23:40,945 --> 00:23:43,627
And if things change, be sure to update it.

576
00:23:43,627 --> 00:23:47,449
Also, try not to update or make any major changes

577
00:23:47,449 --> 00:23:49,230
on your game before a tournament,

578
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,571
otherwise you're gonna piss off your fans.

579
00:23:51,845 --> 00:23:54,906
I thought this was an original idea,

580
00:23:54,906 --> 00:23:58,567
and then somebody showed me this on Saturday,

581
00:23:58,567 --> 00:24:00,988
that Fortnite actually has this too,

582
00:24:00,988 --> 00:24:03,088
and then obviously Epic has their own Trello board,

583
00:24:03,088 --> 00:24:05,409
so it's a popular idea, and it's easy, you can do it.

584
00:24:05,409 --> 00:24:06,970
So final thoughts.

585
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:09,691
I can't stress the importance of working with your community

586
00:24:09,691 --> 00:24:11,771
and enabling them to do cool stuff with your game

587
00:24:11,771 --> 00:24:13,072
when you're an indie.

588
00:24:13,072 --> 00:24:15,112
They can surprise you with what they're capable of doing,

589
00:24:15,112 --> 00:24:18,373
and they are literally the lifeblood of your game.

590
00:24:18,966 --> 00:24:20,507
Oh good, I blacked everything out.

591
00:24:20,507 --> 00:24:22,809
Here's an example of where things could have gone south.

592
00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:24,850
We had a cab owner who just wasn't feeling the game,

593
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:27,132
and so they were talking about getting rid of the cabinet.

594
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,493
But through the efforts of our community,

595
00:24:28,493 --> 00:24:32,295
hosting events like fundraisers, meetups,

596
00:24:32,295 --> 00:24:35,017
we organized our events ourselves there,

597
00:24:35,017 --> 00:24:37,079
or just showing up and giving the game some love,

598
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:38,600
that cab has never left the venue

599
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,241
and still continues to generate money

600
00:24:40,241 --> 00:24:42,383
for the owner to this day by way of quarters

601
00:24:42,383 --> 00:24:44,264
and food and beverage when the players come to play.

602
00:24:46,742 --> 00:24:50,283
So yeah, if you're indie, be nimble with your community

603
00:24:50,283 --> 00:24:52,744
and be personable and authentic to your game.

604
00:24:52,744 --> 00:24:54,725
To an extent, you can respond to and work

605
00:24:54,725 --> 00:24:57,026
with your communities in ways that the bigger studios can't.

606
00:24:57,026 --> 00:25:00,327
The community can be very forgiving of your mistakes

607
00:25:00,327 --> 00:25:02,888
if you show the effort of trying to make the game better.

608
00:25:02,888 --> 00:25:04,528
Be clever about how you do things

609
00:25:04,528 --> 00:25:06,029
and don't take no for an answer.

610
00:25:06,029 --> 00:25:08,150
Move fast because the big boys can't

611
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:09,630
and don't let anything hold you back.

612
00:25:10,378 --> 00:25:14,640
If you're a larger company and studio and watching this talk, engage with your community

613
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,401
and empower them and celebrate them.

614
00:25:16,401 --> 00:25:20,543
Learn about what they really want and really need because you may have more noise to deal

615
00:25:20,543 --> 00:25:23,505
with with a larger community than us as an indie.

616
00:25:23,505 --> 00:25:26,487
Experiment with your game and listen to the community and build goodwill.

617
00:25:26,487 --> 00:25:31,389
If you're scared of backlash and negative feedback from things going wrong, run ideas

618
00:25:31,389 --> 00:25:34,411
by a subset of your community and see how they react.

619
00:25:34,411 --> 00:25:38,974
Do the fun things that indies like us could only wish we could do with money and open

620
00:25:38,974 --> 00:25:39,674
up a little bit.

621
00:25:41,046 --> 00:25:42,948
If you wanna know more about Killer Queen,

622
00:25:42,948 --> 00:25:45,269
we have our Twitter link, the Facebook link,

623
00:25:45,269 --> 00:25:46,370
and our website here.

624
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:49,833
This Saturday, we are doing Killer Queen San Francisco

625
00:25:49,833 --> 00:25:51,554
over at Brewcate SF.

626
00:25:51,554 --> 00:25:55,097
So please check it out there.

627
00:25:55,097 --> 00:25:57,639
Otherwise, look up your local scenes

628
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,961
for Killer Queen Machine and come join the community

629
00:25:59,961 --> 00:26:01,923
and play this dumb bee game with us.

630
00:26:05,267 --> 00:26:08,691
Oh, in exchange for me using Nick in the pool,

631
00:26:08,691 --> 00:26:12,596
I had to put up a picture of Nolan Bushnell for some reason.

632
00:26:12,596 --> 00:26:16,100
But yeah, I guess we have time for maybe two questions.

633
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,883
So if anyone has any questions, please step up.

634
00:26:18,883 --> 00:26:19,644
If not, thank you very much.
