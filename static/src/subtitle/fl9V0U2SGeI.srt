1
00:00:04,284 --> 00:00:09,170
we go. All right. Thank you all for coming. Remember the usual

2
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,655
things. Turn off anything that might make noise. Keep arms and

3
00:00:12,715 --> 00:00:16,900
hands inside the vehicle. And if you've taken AP statistics,

4
00:00:17,681 --> 00:00:19,764
you've seen all this before. So let's see some other talk.

5
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:26,062
AP statistics, big topic, complicated, lots of math. Not

6
00:00:26,122 --> 00:00:29,824
getting into that today. Today I am going to give you the TLDR

7
00:00:29,864 --> 00:00:32,485
version. I'm going to give you immediate results in 30 minutes

8
00:00:32,645 --> 00:00:36,787
like Bob Ross. A few basic moves you can make to bang out some

9
00:00:36,867 --> 00:00:40,289
happy trees and little mountains in the space of this talk.

10
00:00:41,189 --> 00:00:43,210
Actual statisticians will probably be looking down their

11
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,152
noses at me at the things I'm glossing over and simplifying.

12
00:00:46,192 --> 00:00:48,733
But it takes a year to be Rembrandt and 30 minutes to be

13
00:00:48,773 --> 00:00:49,253
Bob Ross.

14
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:51,510
Let's do it.

15
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:55,211
Today I'm going to show you four different ways to come to

16
00:00:55,652 --> 00:00:57,773
decisions about A-B tests using science instead of

17
00:00:57,813 --> 00:00:58,653
yelling about opinions.

18
00:00:59,334 --> 00:01:01,535
All of the stuff you can do in Excel, a couple of them are

19
00:01:01,555 --> 00:01:02,275
built into Excel.

20
00:01:02,575 --> 00:01:04,196
The others are macros that I will give you.

21
00:01:04,216 --> 00:01:06,297
And I'll close out with some words of caution.

22
00:01:07,682 --> 00:01:12,368
Now, to conserve time here, I'm going to gloss over a little bit about the actual how-to in Excel.

23
00:01:12,388 --> 00:01:14,771
I'll show you the dialogues, but I'm going to blitz through them really quickly.

24
00:01:15,752 --> 00:01:19,537
So, all of that information will be up at my support page, along with the slides,

25
00:01:19,677 --> 00:01:21,239
so you don't have to take pictures of every slide.

26
00:01:21,559 --> 00:01:24,062
You can just sit back and enjoy the show such as it is.

27
00:01:25,144 --> 00:01:33,634
Why do we need statistical tests? If you were to walk into a forest and measure every tree and get a graph something like this, you would not need fancy math to know that spruces are taller than maples.

28
00:01:34,255 --> 00:01:42,945
But if you could measure only 16 trees in a forest, and you got a graph like this, well, do happy trees grow taller than unhappy ones? Who can say?

29
00:01:45,102 --> 00:01:49,624
To avoid getting me into NDA trouble, let us say that all of my examples here come from

30
00:01:49,744 --> 00:01:54,087
Hypothetical Games, Incorporated. And here at Hypothetical Games, Incorporated, our build

31
00:01:54,107 --> 00:01:58,330
times kind of suck. A full rebuild of the whole game, including assets, takes two hours.

32
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:03,133
And let's say that I'm a programmer at Hypothetical Games and I'm tired of looking at progress

33
00:02:03,173 --> 00:02:07,395
bars. So I go to my boss and I say, you know, if we just bought everybody a solid state

34
00:02:07,435 --> 00:02:10,217
drive, build times would get faster and I'd save a lot of time.

35
00:02:10,937 --> 00:02:16,321
My boss, he's kind of a curmudgeon, and he makes the good point that SSDs are really expensive,

36
00:02:16,582 --> 00:02:19,704
and would it be worth it to buy one for everybody in the office.

37
00:02:20,004 --> 00:02:22,586
All right, well, I'll come in over a weekend, clean out my disk,

38
00:02:22,866 --> 00:02:25,448
do a full rebuild from scratch, two and a half hours, fantastic.

39
00:02:25,468 --> 00:02:28,831
Now I'm going to take my SSD from home, come in, plug it into my work computer,

40
00:02:29,351 --> 00:02:31,613
build on that thing, two hours and 20 minutes.

41
00:02:31,753 --> 00:02:33,154
All right, 10 minute improvement, a little bit.

42
00:02:34,015 --> 00:02:40,936
Just to be sure though, let me run this test again back on the hard drive, and it's 2 hours and 10 minutes, so what's faster than what?

43
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:47,258
Alright, I'm going to spend the entire weekend building over and over and over again, and I get numbers that are all over the place.

44
00:02:48,258 --> 00:02:52,959
On average, the solid state drive builds about 10 minutes faster, but here's the problem with averages.

45
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:58,220
With a small sample, and a random distribution, you can get completely different averages,

46
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,181
even if the underlying distribution is the same, so long as your sample size is small.

47
00:03:03,061 --> 00:03:03,941
Here's another way of looking at it.

48
00:03:04,481 --> 00:03:05,762
Let's say that I went to two schools

49
00:03:05,802 --> 00:03:07,542
and I gave every kid at each school a puzzle

50
00:03:07,582 --> 00:03:09,563
and I just measured how long it took them to solve the puzzle.

51
00:03:10,263 --> 00:03:11,924
You might look at this and say that kids from New Jersey

52
00:03:11,944 --> 00:03:13,484
are smarter than kids from the Bronx, of course.

53
00:03:14,044 --> 00:03:16,225
But that depends on which particular students

54
00:03:16,245 --> 00:03:16,785
you're testing.

55
00:03:17,365 --> 00:03:18,986
If I had grabbed only three of the students

56
00:03:19,006 --> 00:03:20,386
from every school and tested them,

57
00:03:20,647 --> 00:03:22,987
well, the averages might have looked completely different.

58
00:03:24,348 --> 00:03:25,468
Or they might have looked completely different

59
00:03:25,488 --> 00:03:26,448
in the opposite direction.

60
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:29,489
In fact, we can enumerate every possible

61
00:03:29,529 --> 00:03:30,490
three student combination.

62
00:03:32,433 --> 00:03:35,436
And every average that comes out of every one of those three student combinations,

63
00:03:35,977 --> 00:03:40,101
and those averages of all the combos will itself follow a distribution kind of like this.

64
00:03:40,682 --> 00:03:45,406
So, based on the sample size we have, we have a large uncertainty about whether the mean of the sample

65
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,869
corresponds to the mean of the actual population.

66
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:52,994
As our sample size gets bigger, this estimate becomes more and more precise.

67
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:57,557
And as it gets smaller, we have more and more uncertainty.

68
00:03:57,837 --> 00:03:59,158
So the tests I'm showing you today

69
00:03:59,518 --> 00:04:02,101
are all about managing this particular uncertainty

70
00:04:02,561 --> 00:04:05,423
of having only an estimate of this population mean

71
00:04:05,443 --> 00:04:06,184
from your sample mean.

72
00:04:06,905 --> 00:04:08,566
And in case you're wondering where this data comes from,

73
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:10,408
it's the exact same distribution.

74
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:12,509
So any differences were purely from chance.

75
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,622
All right, back to build times. We're scientists. Scientists

76
00:04:16,682 --> 00:04:18,904
build a hypothesis and then test it. What's my hypothesis?

77
00:04:19,545 --> 00:04:22,407
Build times are faster in a solid state drive. Actually,

78
00:04:22,467 --> 00:04:24,309
it's easier to disprove something than it is to prove

79
00:04:24,349 --> 00:04:28,493
it. So let's disprove Fred. Fred's hypothesis is that SSDs

80
00:04:28,553 --> 00:04:31,335
don't make a difference. And if we can show that Fred is wrong,

81
00:04:31,736 --> 00:04:33,297
then I'm right. Probably.

82
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:37,951
The test for this is called Student's Tea Test.

83
00:04:37,971 --> 00:04:39,832
It's actually named after this guy, William Gossett,

84
00:04:40,412 --> 00:04:42,273
who had to publish under the pseudonym Student

85
00:04:42,353 --> 00:04:44,334
because he was under NDA to Guinness at the time

86
00:04:44,354 --> 00:04:45,015
that he invented it.

87
00:04:45,455 --> 00:04:45,815
Go figure.

88
00:04:46,836 --> 00:04:48,477
He was concerned with quality control on beer.

89
00:04:48,777 --> 00:04:50,758
So let's say that this distribution represents

90
00:04:50,778 --> 00:04:52,579
like the specific gravity of bottles of Guinness

91
00:04:52,599 --> 00:04:53,439
that roll off the line.

92
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,860
And it's kind of clustered.

93
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,801
It's a little bit of variation.

94
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:58,922
And for every batch, he has to grab 10 bottles

95
00:04:58,982 --> 00:05:01,144
off the next batch, look at those 10 bottles,

96
00:05:01,484 --> 00:05:03,125
kind of guess at what the real distribution is

97
00:05:03,165 --> 00:05:04,545
that they represent, and then say,

98
00:05:05,913 --> 00:05:08,214
Do those bottles match Guinness' quality control standards,

99
00:05:08,534 --> 00:05:11,215
or are they different enough from the specs that we have

100
00:05:11,495 --> 00:05:12,575
that we need to kill the batch?

101
00:05:13,196 --> 00:05:16,797
Now, student's boss, apparently an ancestor of Fred,

102
00:05:18,498 --> 00:05:20,198
not a big fan of killing the entire batch

103
00:05:20,218 --> 00:05:21,019
and a bunch of profits.

104
00:05:21,159 --> 00:05:22,439
And he says, well, you know,

105
00:05:22,459 --> 00:05:23,720
you've only got 10 bottles here.

106
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,701
With a sample size that small,

107
00:05:25,761 --> 00:05:28,702
maybe your sample mean is only a little bit different

108
00:05:28,742 --> 00:05:30,302
from the population mean just by chance.

109
00:05:31,223 --> 00:05:33,083
I can prove you're wrong, says student, probably.

110
00:05:34,589 --> 00:05:38,451
There's a couple ways. One is if the mean of our sample was way different from the

111
00:05:38,591 --> 00:05:41,532
from the spec that we're expecting, we can know like there is no possible way these

112
00:05:41,552 --> 00:05:42,633
ten bottles could represent

113
00:05:42,993 --> 00:05:43,773
a good batch of beer.

114
00:05:44,513 --> 00:05:47,555
Or, if student had measured every single bottle that came off the line, then we

115
00:05:47,595 --> 00:05:48,715
would have a really good estimate.

116
00:05:50,328 --> 00:05:50,748
of the mean.

117
00:05:51,609 --> 00:05:53,110
But if the sample size is small,

118
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,791
and the means are close to each other,

119
00:05:55,711 --> 00:05:57,652
well, you know, we can't really disprove Fred.

120
00:05:58,613 --> 00:06:01,274
So this is what the student's t-test built into Excel does.

121
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:02,795
It's one of the most useful tests in statistics.

122
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:04,796
It takes the data values that you have,

123
00:06:04,876 --> 00:06:06,137
and it takes the size of the sample,

124
00:06:06,597 --> 00:06:07,777
and it spits out a number p,

125
00:06:08,178 --> 00:06:09,658
which for the purposes of this talk,

126
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:11,700
is basically the chance that Fred is right.

127
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,772
We can make a bet with Fred before we run the numbers to say

128
00:06:16,532 --> 00:06:19,514
if there is less than say a 5% chance that you're right,

129
00:06:20,055 --> 00:06:21,596
then we'll agree that you're probably wrong

130
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,357
and the two samples are in fact different.

131
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,779
So that's what P is.

132
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,540
The P value that you've seen in like

133
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,501
all the scientific studies,

134
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:31,343
it's basically the chance of a false positive

135
00:06:31,483 --> 00:06:32,924
on saying that the two things are different.

136
00:06:33,345 --> 00:06:35,086
So if Fred's wrong, we can say we rejected

137
00:06:35,106 --> 00:06:37,468
the null hypothesis, we've rejected the Fred hypothesis,

138
00:06:37,968 --> 00:06:40,530
and the two groups are statistically significantly different.

139
00:06:40,931 --> 00:06:43,072
But you gotta pick this number before you do any tests.

140
00:06:43,432 --> 00:06:46,934
Like, don't shoot an arrow at a hay bale and then paint the target around it and call it bullseye

141
00:06:46,954 --> 00:06:50,135
and say, well it's a 15% chance of being a false positive, we must be fine.

142
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:55,797
Also, any actual statisticians in the audience are now totally cringing because I've completely oversimplified everything.

143
00:06:56,597 --> 00:06:59,118
P-values are hard, good enough for our purposes.

144
00:06:59,518 --> 00:07:00,238
Back to the build times.

145
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:02,659
Here they are in minutes.

146
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,560
So here's how you do a t-test in Excel.

147
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,080
It's built in. You go to the data menu.

148
00:07:06,901 --> 00:07:07,961
You pop open this tool pack.

149
00:07:08,581 --> 00:07:09,501
You pick t-test.

150
00:07:09,942 --> 00:07:11,162
In this case we're doing two samples.

151
00:07:12,794 --> 00:07:16,483
pops up a wizard, you specify your acceptable false positive

152
00:07:16,523 --> 00:07:18,688
threshold there, gives you a table.

153
00:07:19,661 --> 00:07:20,682
That's the number you care about.

154
00:07:23,823 --> 00:07:25,024
0.043, 4.3% chance of Fred being right.

155
00:07:25,584 --> 00:07:27,405
There's this one-tail number, ignore it.

156
00:07:27,925 --> 00:07:29,926
That number is for when you are certain

157
00:07:30,246 --> 00:07:31,687
what direction the difference may be in.

158
00:07:31,707 --> 00:07:32,567
You would only use that number

159
00:07:32,627 --> 00:07:33,848
if you were absolutely positive,

160
00:07:34,188 --> 00:07:36,409
without doubt that SSDs could only build faster

161
00:07:36,469 --> 00:07:37,070
and not slower.

162
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,011
But you never know that ahead of time.

163
00:07:39,131 --> 00:07:40,952
If you did, you wouldn't need to be doing the statistics.

164
00:07:41,572 --> 00:07:42,732
So always use the two-tail value.

165
00:07:43,613 --> 00:07:45,333
Now, should we actually buy the SSDs?

166
00:07:46,053 --> 00:07:48,174
All we've shown is that the two populations are different,

167
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:50,774
but not how different, and not whether it's worth spending

168
00:07:50,794 --> 00:07:51,815
all the money on those drives.

169
00:07:52,355 --> 00:07:54,535
So what we actually care about is the actual difference

170
00:07:54,575 --> 00:07:56,016
in means, how much of a change is it.

171
00:07:57,536 --> 00:07:59,396
This difference in means has a margin of error

172
00:07:59,436 --> 00:08:00,697
just like the actual sample mean.

173
00:08:01,717 --> 00:08:04,477
And we call that the confidence interval

174
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:06,058
in the difference in means, which is basically,

175
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:07,778
we know that the difference is 11 minutes,

176
00:08:08,358 --> 00:08:09,238
give or take a few minutes.

177
00:08:10,425 --> 00:08:12,767
We calculate the give or take using this macro that I'm

178
00:08:12,807 --> 00:08:15,268
giving you at that slide, at that URL that I showed you

179
00:08:15,308 --> 00:08:16,369
earlier, and we'll show you again.

180
00:08:17,109 --> 00:08:19,671
In this case, it pops out a number, 8.14.

181
00:08:19,771 --> 00:08:22,392
That means that the actual difference in build times is,

182
00:08:22,792 --> 00:08:27,015
with 95% certainty, somewhere between 11 minutes minus or

183
00:08:27,055 --> 00:08:29,796
plus 8 minutes, which is to say somewhere between about

184
00:08:30,056 --> 00:08:30,757
3 and 19 minutes.

185
00:08:33,558 --> 00:08:34,439
So should we buy the drives?

186
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:35,259
Let's do the arithmetic.

187
00:08:36,281 --> 00:08:39,044
We've saved about 11 minutes per build.

188
00:08:40,265 --> 00:08:42,146
Let's say a dev costs the company $0.50 a minute.

189
00:08:42,527 --> 00:08:44,048
So we've saved $5.50 a build.

190
00:08:44,409 --> 00:08:46,330
SSD costs about $300.

191
00:08:47,091 --> 00:08:51,115
So every dev would need to be doing 55 builds from scratch

192
00:08:51,295 --> 00:08:52,656
in order for the SSD to pay for itself.

193
00:08:53,237 --> 00:08:54,318
Except we've got that uncertainty.

194
00:08:54,758 --> 00:08:56,260
So if we did this test like 1,000 times,

195
00:08:57,941 --> 00:09:01,682
the average would be somewhere between 3 minutes and 19 minutes difference

196
00:09:01,882 --> 00:09:07,024
so we would have to do somewhere between 210 or 31 full rebuilds per dev

197
00:09:07,344 --> 00:09:08,405
for the drive to pay for itself

198
00:09:08,805 --> 00:09:12,366
so just because the two things are statistically significantly different

199
00:09:12,606 --> 00:09:14,527
it doesn't mean that the difference is actually practical

200
00:09:14,567 --> 00:09:16,548
you have to look at how big the difference in means is

201
00:09:16,808 --> 00:09:19,249
you can't just say well the two things are different then we should buy all the drives

202
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:41,997
Incidentally, if the confidence interval straddled zero, if I said the difference in build times is like five minutes plus or minus ten minutes, then it's like the improvement is negative five to fifteen minutes, which is to say I've definitely proven that things are either better or worse or the same, which is to say it proved absolutely nothing. So if your confidence interval straddles zero, you don't have a result.

203
00:09:43,356 --> 00:09:48,378
You use a t-test for continuous outcomes, anything you can measure with like an integer or floating point number.

204
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:52,420
And you use it for things that are sort of normal-ishly distributed, kind of bell-shaped.

205
00:09:52,841 --> 00:09:58,203
It doesn't have to be exact, the t-test is pretty robust, you can get away with a lot of lopsidedness and a lot of lumpiness,

206
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:02,325
but it has to be something that has a real mean like that, where the mean is meaningful.

207
00:10:03,444 --> 00:10:04,785
If you've got something like the one on the right,

208
00:10:05,285 --> 00:10:06,286
the average value there,

209
00:10:06,766 --> 00:10:08,628
like there aren't even any members of the population

210
00:10:08,668 --> 00:10:09,568
that are at that average.

211
00:10:09,628 --> 00:10:12,811
Like saying the average human being has 1.9 eyes.

212
00:10:13,652 --> 00:10:15,933
So, it doesn't really matter.

213
00:10:16,034 --> 00:10:17,195
So you can't use a t-test for that.

214
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,837
Okay, let's say that Hypothetical Games

215
00:10:19,917 --> 00:10:21,558
is working on an online puzzle title,

216
00:10:22,499 --> 00:10:23,379
Angry Confectioners.

217
00:10:24,941 --> 00:10:25,941
And this is one of those games

218
00:10:25,961 --> 00:10:27,623
where we can actually push updates up to our players

219
00:10:27,663 --> 00:10:28,383
and measure them live.

220
00:10:28,724 --> 00:10:29,204
Fantastic.

221
00:10:30,973 --> 00:10:33,998
So we've got our new cupcake mode and cupcake mode isn't doing great.

222
00:10:35,584 --> 00:10:39,327
And Fred says, you know, I think cupcake mode just isn't any fun and we should probably cut it.

223
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:45,452
I'm thinking, you know, I think, like I've been talking to my friends and they're just complaining that cupcake mode is just a little too hard.

224
00:10:45,892 --> 00:10:50,035
And I think if we make cupcake mode easier, people would play the puzzles more because they'd get less frustrated.

225
00:10:50,836 --> 00:10:56,160
Here's the problem. Play times for this game are all over the place. Some people play one hour a week, some people play ten hour a week.

226
00:10:56,581 --> 00:11:03,606
So, how can we, like, measure a difference in play time when we've got such a huge diversity in player, in player, uh, play times?

227
00:11:04,547 --> 00:11:05,828
So, how about this?

228
00:11:06,629 --> 00:11:10,713
How about we run an experiment, I'll show some people the easy version, I'll show some people the hard version, and I'll switch them,

229
00:11:11,453 --> 00:11:14,997
and then we'll compare every person's playtime during the week where they saw the hard version

230
00:11:15,797 --> 00:11:18,900
to that same person's playtime when they played the easy version.

231
00:11:19,181 --> 00:11:21,783
We can filter out individual differences between people in this way.

232
00:11:23,024 --> 00:11:28,169
When we do this, it's still a t-test, it's just called a paired t-test, as opposed to a two-sample, also built into Excel.

233
00:11:31,055 --> 00:11:33,016
What we're asking is if I make this puzzle easier,

234
00:11:33,717 --> 00:11:34,597
more people spend time playing,

235
00:11:34,617 --> 00:11:35,737
we've got two versions of the puzzle,

236
00:11:36,438 --> 00:11:38,419
and my hypothesis that I'm trying to prove or disprove

237
00:11:38,979 --> 00:11:41,000
is that people play the hard version

238
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,421
either more or less than they play the easy one.

239
00:11:43,741 --> 00:11:46,362
And Fred's saying, no, cupcake mode just is no fun at all,

240
00:11:46,422 --> 00:11:48,323
we should cut it, I don't think how hard it's going to be

241
00:11:48,343 --> 00:11:49,163
is gonna make a difference.

242
00:11:49,763 --> 00:11:50,464
Let's run the experiment.

243
00:11:51,164 --> 00:11:55,666
We've got a population, cut them in half, half of them get the easy version, half of them get the hard version.

244
00:11:55,686 --> 00:11:59,448
After a week, give them a switcheroo, record how long they all played the game.

245
00:11:59,828 --> 00:12:04,090
The advantage of doing a crossover this way is it filters out things like everybody playing the game less week to week,

246
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:08,713
or if there's a holiday or something, like it kind of washes out because you've split the population in half.

247
00:12:09,972 --> 00:12:12,616
We've got data from every player for every version.

248
00:12:12,636 --> 00:12:14,379
Let's add 40 more of these.

249
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,824
Now we calculate the difference for each person

250
00:12:17,864 --> 00:12:19,166
from how much they played the hard version

251
00:12:19,186 --> 00:12:20,407
from how much they played the easy version.

252
00:12:20,868 --> 00:12:21,789
Looks kind of like that.

253
00:12:23,072 --> 00:12:24,292
That's where the zero number is.

254
00:12:24,892 --> 00:12:25,832
Looks a little bit lopsided.

255
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:26,993
Let's do the math.

256
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,593
Go back to that data analysis thing in Excel.

257
00:12:29,993 --> 00:12:32,034
You pick paired two sample t-test.

258
00:12:32,754 --> 00:12:33,554
Out pops this number.

259
00:12:34,895 --> 00:12:35,875
1% chance of Fred being right.

260
00:12:36,235 --> 00:12:39,056
So we can say that yes, people do play the hard version

261
00:12:39,516 --> 00:12:41,556
about negative .18 hours less per week,

262
00:12:41,576 --> 00:12:43,457
about 11 minutes less per week.

263
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:47,798
So yes, we should probably make cupcake mode

264
00:12:47,818 --> 00:12:48,458
a little bit easier.

265
00:12:48,978 --> 00:12:50,118
And maybe change the other puzzles too.

266
00:12:51,911 --> 00:12:54,372
What about binary outcomes?

267
00:12:54,452 --> 00:12:56,232
Questions like, do people turn left or right?

268
00:12:56,352 --> 00:12:58,053
Do they do the thing or not?

269
00:12:58,413 --> 00:12:59,753
Do they even buy something or not?

270
00:13:00,514 --> 00:13:02,294
Let's say that Hypothetical Games is

271
00:13:02,334 --> 00:13:03,815
working on Generic MOBA.

272
00:13:04,135 --> 00:13:06,095
And Generic MOBA is a free-to-play game that makes

273
00:13:06,135 --> 00:13:07,956
its money by selling garments of some description.

274
00:13:09,837 --> 00:13:11,217
Pants, let's say.

275
00:13:13,198 --> 00:13:14,458
So we have a nice pants shop.

276
00:13:14,998 --> 00:13:17,699
The problem is, nobody goes to the pants shop.

277
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,141
And Fred's kind of getting a little bit peevish with me.

278
00:13:26,821 --> 00:13:29,522
Well, so our problem is that nobody even goes to the store.

279
00:13:30,363 --> 00:13:31,543
Do they know the store is there?

280
00:13:31,643 --> 00:13:33,744
Maybe there's like an activation energy.

281
00:13:33,784 --> 00:13:35,025
Like maybe they just have to get over that hump.

282
00:13:35,425 --> 00:13:38,047
So what can we do that makes them at least go to the store

283
00:13:38,467 --> 00:13:41,288
at least once and buy or just do anything there,

284
00:13:41,368 --> 00:13:42,469
see that they have an inventory?

285
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:44,850
Maybe they'll notice something's on sale and want to buy pants.

286
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:45,771
So how about?

287
00:13:46,571 --> 00:13:49,973
I'm like this, how about we give everybody a free coupon for one free monocle.

288
00:13:50,433 --> 00:13:55,156
And you go to the store and you cash that in, and then they'll have gone through the experience of knowing that the store is there and doing all that.

289
00:13:55,276 --> 00:14:01,520
And Fred's like, wait, we're not selling any pants, and now you want to lose the revenue on monocles as well, what difference is this going to make?

290
00:14:02,981 --> 00:14:03,582
Here's our question.

291
00:14:04,462 --> 00:14:06,684
Are people who get a monocle more likely to buy pants?

292
00:14:07,284 --> 00:14:08,885
Alright, let's do a scientific study once again.

293
00:14:08,905 --> 00:14:12,847
We've got our players, let's cut them into a control group and an experimental group.

294
00:14:13,792 --> 00:14:16,981
experimental group gets monocles, control group gets no monocle coupons.

295
00:14:18,328 --> 00:14:23,753
We'll wait, we'll wait a couple weeks, and we'll see how many people from each group went on to buy pants at some point in the next couple weeks.

296
00:14:24,453 --> 00:14:29,458
What's my hypothesis? I'm hypothesizing that people who got the monocles are more likely to buy pants that week.

297
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:35,764
And Fred's like, hang on a second, you're making an assumption here, and your assumption is that people who get monocles are more likely to buy pants.

298
00:14:36,504 --> 00:14:42,810
But you've got no data for that, right? I could easily be making people less likely to buy pants, maybe I have filled their sartorial needs for the week.

299
00:14:43,571 --> 00:14:43,671
So...

300
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:46,827
Whenever you're doing this kind of test, and you're saying,

301
00:14:47,107 --> 00:14:48,248
have I caused more of something?

302
00:14:48,668 --> 00:14:50,250
Consider that you might have caused less of it.

303
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:52,352
That's exactly what the two-tailed test is about.

304
00:14:52,372 --> 00:14:56,116
All right, so our hypothesis is that people in the

305
00:14:56,136 --> 00:14:58,137
experimental group buy pants at a different rate from the

306
00:14:58,177 --> 00:14:58,838
control group people.

307
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,781
And Fred's hypothesis is that it doesn't make a difference,

308
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:03,202
and they're going to buy pants at the same rate.

309
00:15:03,913 --> 00:15:04,153
All right.

310
00:15:04,834 --> 00:15:06,514
Also, if we did this test 100 times,

311
00:15:06,534 --> 00:15:07,974
you'd get slightly different results every time.

312
00:15:08,114 --> 00:15:10,235
So for this test, we also have the confidence intervals

313
00:15:10,275 --> 00:15:11,375
things and a little bit of uncertainty.

314
00:15:11,515 --> 00:15:12,155
We'll work those out.

315
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,155
Got two options for this scenario.

316
00:15:14,936 --> 00:15:16,936
One is the so-called relative risk test.

317
00:15:17,036 --> 00:15:18,496
This is used in epidemiology.

318
00:15:18,616 --> 00:15:20,497
It's the thing where they say, like, people who smoke

319
00:15:20,537 --> 00:15:22,497
are four times as likely to spontaneously combust.

320
00:15:23,397 --> 00:15:25,158
The other is the difference of proportions.

321
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:27,838
And it's what you say when you say our market share has

322
00:15:27,878 --> 00:15:29,118
increased by 5 percentage points.

323
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:30,259
And you really mean it's gone from 20 to 25,

324
00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:31,239
as opposed to like 20 to 22.

325
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:35,168
Let's do the relative risk first.

326
00:15:36,008 --> 00:15:36,529
Here's our data.

327
00:15:36,909 --> 00:15:38,230
Eight people in the control group bought pants

328
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:38,870
after a couple weeks.

329
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,551
19 people in the experimental group

330
00:15:40,651 --> 00:15:41,612
bought pants in a couple weeks.

331
00:15:42,472 --> 00:15:43,333
Chart looks kind of like that.

332
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,634
Well, that's the number of people

333
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:46,815
from the experimental group who bought pants.

334
00:15:47,315 --> 00:15:49,837
It's about two and a half times, a little bit less,

335
00:15:50,017 --> 00:15:50,677
than the number of people

336
00:15:50,697 --> 00:15:51,758
in the control group who bought pants.

337
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:53,799
So the relative risk of somebody

338
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:55,360
in the experimental group buying pants is about 2.4.

339
00:15:58,512 --> 00:16:02,537
The confidence interval, once again from the macros that I've given you at the URL,

340
00:16:03,178 --> 00:16:10,407
comes out to about 1.08 to 5.25, so we know that monocle recipients are about 2.4 times more likely,

341
00:16:11,749 --> 00:16:12,610
with an uncertainty.

342
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,180
of somewhere between 1.1 and 5.25.

343
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,141
But Fred's definitely wrong,

344
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:21,021
or at least he's only 3% likely to be right.

345
00:16:21,901 --> 00:16:22,941
Let's do the difference of proportions.

346
00:16:23,122 --> 00:16:23,962
So that's much simpler,

347
00:16:24,002 --> 00:16:26,322
we've got a 5% conversion ratio on the control group,

348
00:16:26,782 --> 00:16:29,083
12% on the experimental group, 12 minus five is seven.

349
00:16:29,763 --> 00:16:30,383
That's our number.

350
00:16:32,744 --> 00:16:34,264
Once again, there's a confidence interval here

351
00:16:34,304 --> 00:16:35,184
that we have to calculate.

352
00:16:35,664 --> 00:16:37,005
Macro for that is up on the page as well.

353
00:16:37,325 --> 00:16:38,325
If you do the math this way,

354
00:16:38,405 --> 00:16:39,605
the interval comes out to about 0.8%, to about 13%.

355
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:40,705
Small sample size, huge uncertainty.

356
00:16:44,923 --> 00:16:46,764
Which test do we use in this scenario?

357
00:16:46,984 --> 00:16:48,465
Well, what question are we trying to answer?

358
00:16:48,845 --> 00:16:50,566
In this case, we're trying to answer how much more cash

359
00:16:50,606 --> 00:16:52,807
are we getting out of people by giving them the coupons?

360
00:16:53,368 --> 00:16:55,229
In this case, the absolute test is useful, right?

361
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:59,051
12 per 100 people in the experimental group buy pants,

362
00:16:59,211 --> 00:17:01,292
five in 100 people in the control group buy pants,

363
00:17:01,352 --> 00:17:04,434
so that's about 59 bucks per 100 players in the experimental,

364
00:17:04,854 --> 00:17:06,115
25 bucks per 100 players in the control,

365
00:17:06,715 --> 00:17:07,676
so about a $34 difference.

366
00:17:09,317 --> 00:17:12,237
or depending on that uncertainty somewhere between four and sixty four dollars.

367
00:17:12,257 --> 00:17:16,719
You know if I went to Fred and said we could probably make thirty four bucks more per hundred

368
00:17:16,739 --> 00:17:23,721
players he'd be like, eh. But if I went to him and I said this idea makes people more than

369
00:17:23,801 --> 00:17:28,722
twice as likely to buy pants, sounds a little bit better. So my conclusion is you should use the

370
00:17:28,762 --> 00:17:33,583
relative risk test to convince your boss, your marketing department, your VP, and the

371
00:17:33,643 --> 00:17:35,904
absolute test to convince yourself.

372
00:17:38,746 --> 00:17:41,588
All right, what if our distribution is kind of

373
00:17:41,608 --> 00:17:42,549
lopsided, like this?

374
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:48,113
What if we've got like an app store rating like this, right?

375
00:17:48,153 --> 00:17:50,835
And rating people one to five, and you know app store ratings

376
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:53,196
are always kind of bimodal because human beings are

377
00:17:53,397 --> 00:17:56,038
nonlinear and the difference in our heads between five stars

378
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:58,140
and four stars is not the same as between four and three.

379
00:17:59,381 --> 00:18:00,141
Let's think of an example.

380
00:18:00,161 --> 00:18:02,263
All right, hypothetical games, working on a new puzzle.

381
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:06,931
We built the puzzle. We send it home with our friends and family for a weekend to play test it.

382
00:18:07,051 --> 00:18:08,252
We've got some metrics in the app.

383
00:18:09,533 --> 00:18:10,874
Data comes back after the weekend.

384
00:18:11,294 --> 00:18:13,416
Here's how long everybody played our game before they got bored.

385
00:18:15,238 --> 00:18:17,320
Most people didn't play it very much. A couple people played it a lot.

386
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,561
Look at this thing and say,

387
00:18:18,581 --> 00:18:20,843
I think I can probably do better than that.

388
00:18:21,503 --> 00:18:21,784
Alright.

389
00:18:22,564 --> 00:18:24,886
So, spend a week coding up a new version of the puzzle.

390
00:18:25,127 --> 00:18:27,649
Fix a few things. Send it home with a totally different group of testers.

391
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:29,511
Data comes back like that.

392
00:18:30,703 --> 00:18:31,603
I think it's an improvement.

393
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:35,265
But if you look at the actual averages of these two groups,

394
00:18:35,765 --> 00:18:38,567
the average time spent playing the orange puzzle is less.

395
00:18:38,967 --> 00:18:40,608
It's 6, or 5.9.

396
00:18:40,988 --> 00:18:42,669
And the average time spent playing the blue puzzle

397
00:18:42,969 --> 00:18:43,429
is higher, 6.8.

398
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:44,630
Why?

399
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:49,252
Because averages are very sensitive to outliers.

400
00:18:52,266 --> 00:18:55,991
And I'm like, but Fred, 78% of the people who played the blue

401
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:58,615
puzzle played it for less, a lower than average amount of

402
00:18:58,655 --> 00:19:02,841
time. And like, this, who is this? Is this your parents?

403
00:19:06,168 --> 00:19:09,511
So the number we care about is the median, which is just the number where

404
00:19:09,851 --> 00:19:13,594
half the population is less than that and half the population is more than that.

405
00:19:14,074 --> 00:19:17,797
In this case, the median time spent playing for the blue puzzle is two,

406
00:19:17,898 --> 00:19:20,119
which is like half the people played for less than two hours.

407
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,762
But in the case of the orange puzzle, the median is six,

408
00:19:23,902 --> 00:19:26,384
so half of the people played as much as six hours.

409
00:19:27,575 --> 00:19:32,436
Now Fred, always the sourpuss, is telling me, well this is because we only tested it in like a dozen people.

410
00:19:32,496 --> 00:19:37,077
And if you did this with a hundred players, the two puzzle playtimes would look more or less the same.

411
00:19:37,097 --> 00:19:39,837
I'm like, no, we can math our way out of this one.

412
00:19:41,398 --> 00:19:43,478
The test for this one is the Mann-Whitney test.

413
00:19:44,298 --> 00:19:47,299
It is, once again, an Excel macro that I've linked to.

414
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:52,560
This one is not built into Excel, but there's this awesome guy who made a whole bunch of wizards that includes this one.

415
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,700
Here is our data.

416
00:19:56,044 --> 00:19:59,405
On the left we've got the number of hours that people played Fred's version of the puzzle.

417
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:02,427
On the right we've got the number of hours that people played my version of the puzzle.

418
00:20:03,087 --> 00:20:04,468
Pull the data into Excel.

419
00:20:05,028 --> 00:20:07,350
Pop open the thing, this is the wizard that I'm giving you.

420
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:11,132
Pop open the non-parametric test, up comes the man Whitney.

421
00:20:12,392 --> 00:20:13,513
Data comes out like this.

422
00:20:14,653 --> 00:20:15,814
Chance of Fred being right is 3%.

423
00:20:17,355 --> 00:20:19,336
Orange version of the puzzle is better.

424
00:20:21,917 --> 00:20:22,417
Some cautions.

425
00:20:23,495 --> 00:20:29,618
All this time we have been using 5% as the threshold for a false positive.

426
00:20:29,658 --> 00:20:33,220
But you know what? 5% happens a lot, as you all probably noticed.

427
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,181
So you've always got to define your hypothesis before you do the test.

428
00:20:37,281 --> 00:20:38,662
Make your bet with Fred before you run into it.

429
00:20:39,022 --> 00:20:39,982
And don't go data mining.

430
00:20:41,063 --> 00:20:44,864
Don't do the thing where you say we've got like a hundred different metrics in our players

431
00:20:44,904 --> 00:20:48,844
and let's run a hundred different t-tests to see if any of them correlate with console brand.

432
00:20:48,884 --> 00:20:51,405
Do people on PlayStation play longer than Xbox? No. Okay.

433
00:20:51,705 --> 00:20:53,985
Do people on PlayStation buy more than Xbox? No.

434
00:20:54,005 --> 00:20:55,266
Do they kill more dragons? Whatever.

435
00:20:55,286 --> 00:21:00,007
If you have a 5% chance of any one of these tests giving you a false positive,

436
00:21:00,387 --> 00:21:03,827
you are almost certain, if you've done that many, to be off the charts.

437
00:21:03,907 --> 00:21:06,068
I mean, to definitely get a false positive.

438
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:11,291
especially do not do the thing where you've got a hundred variables and you say for every one of these hundreds

439
00:21:11,772 --> 00:21:15,654
Do they correlate with any of the other 99 variables because then you are absolutely

440
00:21:15,694 --> 00:21:19,537
Guaranteed to get a false positive and you are not doing science. You are running a novelty website

441
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,522
Also, even if you have a real association between two things

442
00:21:27,509 --> 00:21:29,530
It doesn't necessarily mean that one thing is causing the other.

443
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:31,791
Right? We've all heard the thing, correlation is not causation.

444
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:35,273
It's not just that two things can be correlated without being linked.

445
00:21:35,373 --> 00:21:39,716
It's that they can truly be linked, but not have a causal linkage.

446
00:21:40,677 --> 00:21:45,980
For example, on correlated.org, 22 people who took the survey have a Pinterest account.

447
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,041
39% of them have a, sorry, 22% of them have a Pinterest account.

448
00:21:48,081 --> 00:21:51,644
39% of the people who own cardigans have a Pinterest account.

449
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,822
Does cardigans cause having Pinterest accounts? Does

450
00:21:58,882 --> 00:22:01,144
Pinterest cause buying cardigans? Does the same

451
00:22:01,184 --> 00:22:04,686
people like both cardigans and Pinterest? Can't tell from this

452
00:22:04,706 --> 00:22:07,709
data. Let's do a lightning round. Put it all together.

453
00:22:08,549 --> 00:22:11,331
Working on a VR game. Got a new camera scheme. Does it make our

454
00:22:11,351 --> 00:22:13,873
playtesters less nauseous than the other scheme? What are we

455
00:22:13,913 --> 00:22:17,196
measuring? If we are measuring whether testers were able to

456
00:22:17,276 --> 00:22:18,357
finish the game or not.

457
00:22:20,348 --> 00:22:22,290
It's a binary outcome and a relative risk test,

458
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:23,651
or difference of proportions.

459
00:22:24,432 --> 00:22:26,474
What if we're measuring how long they're able to play

460
00:22:26,514 --> 00:22:27,394
before they need a break?

461
00:22:28,275 --> 00:22:29,957
It's a continuous outcome, it's kind of bell-shaped,

462
00:22:30,077 --> 00:22:32,058
probably, so you can use a t-test for this one.

463
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:37,283
What if we've asked them to rate their nausea

464
00:22:37,303 --> 00:22:38,063
from one to five?

465
00:22:38,604 --> 00:22:40,546
Well, if the ratings come in in the bell curve,

466
00:22:40,566 --> 00:22:41,346
we can use a t-test.

467
00:22:41,486 --> 00:22:42,647
If the ratings come out like this,

468
00:22:43,468 --> 00:22:44,509
it's not a normal outcome,

469
00:22:44,569 --> 00:22:46,591
so we have to use the Mann-Whitney test.

470
00:22:47,672 --> 00:22:48,973
What if we're making an educational game?

471
00:22:49,573 --> 00:22:51,774
We've let kids play our game.

472
00:22:51,834 --> 00:22:53,375
Can they math better after playing our game?

473
00:22:53,555 --> 00:22:56,716
Well, if we are comparing before and after test scores

474
00:22:57,056 --> 00:23:00,118
on the same kids, like every kid after every kid before,

475
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,781
It is a paired t-test.

476
00:23:04,682 --> 00:23:06,283
If you were to compare like a control group and an

477
00:23:06,323 --> 00:23:08,464
experimental group, you would calculate the difference

478
00:23:08,484 --> 00:23:10,466
between before and after for every student from the

479
00:23:10,506 --> 00:23:12,167
control, the difference between before and after from

480
00:23:12,207 --> 00:23:14,168
every student for the experimental, and you would do

481
00:23:14,228 --> 00:23:16,649
an independent t-test on the differences.

482
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:20,312
We're making a game with a lot of PVP character classes.

483
00:23:20,512 --> 00:23:21,212
Are they balanced?

484
00:23:21,893 --> 00:23:23,193
Seek adult supervision.

485
00:23:24,254 --> 00:23:25,535
Can't do it with the math I've shown you.

486
00:23:26,856 --> 00:23:27,956
But you can do some further reading.

487
00:23:29,019 --> 00:23:31,920
So as I mentioned, I've given you some tests that are good in

488
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:35,581
certain specific scenarios, but with this moderate power comes

489
00:23:35,721 --> 00:23:39,501
moderate responsibility. Do not push your tests beyond what

490
00:23:39,541 --> 00:23:42,602
they are able to do. Here is a chart from a real scientific

491
00:23:42,622 --> 00:23:45,443
study I found. Basically some experimental psychologists asked

492
00:23:45,703 --> 00:23:48,484
people a bunch of questions like, do you enjoy bitter foods

493
00:23:48,524 --> 00:23:51,784
and drinks? And do you tend to be cynical? And then they

494
00:23:51,824 --> 00:23:54,345
correlated every one of these questions against every other

495
00:23:54,385 --> 00:23:57,206
one of these questions. So people who tend to be cynical

496
00:23:57,266 --> 00:23:58,786
tend to enjoy bitter foods and drinks.

497
00:23:59,986 --> 00:24:11,912
headline the next week. That's good stuff. Use your skills for

498
00:24:11,952 --> 00:24:17,474
good and not stupid. Please. All right. Thanks to everybody

499
00:24:17,514 --> 00:24:20,555
who helped me out with this talk. Mark Cerini, of course. My

500
00:24:20,615 --> 00:24:24,277
long-suffering sponsor, Haldor. My boss, Mike Acton, who was the

501
00:24:24,397 --> 00:24:26,258
opposite of Fred, I just want to say right here.

502
00:24:28,588 --> 00:24:29,869
and everybody who came to my rehearsals.

503
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:32,773
And extra special, special thanks to Dr. Garrison

504
00:24:32,813 --> 00:24:33,875
at the University of Washington,

505
00:24:33,915 --> 00:24:36,338
who literally taught me everything I know about statistics

506
00:24:36,879 --> 00:24:38,260
and without whom this talk would not have been

507
00:24:38,361 --> 00:24:39,422
even remotely possible.

508
00:24:40,343 --> 00:24:42,266
And to my surprise, I even have time for Q&A.

509
00:24:59,368 --> 00:25:00,309
Hi, I got a question.

510
00:25:00,569 --> 00:25:02,351
Oh, so there you are.

511
00:25:02,691 --> 00:25:14,082
So, when discussing rating nausea from 1 to 5, you said if the results look like a bell curve, use t-test, otherwise use that other one.

512
00:25:14,642 --> 00:25:14,782
Yep.

513
00:25:15,863 --> 00:25:22,509
It seems like it would be tempting to choose the test that gives better results.

514
00:25:23,394 --> 00:25:25,356
That is an excellent point.

515
00:25:25,897 --> 00:25:27,558
Yes, you should probably just use the Mann-Whitney test.

516
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:29,861
So scales like that are called Likert scales.

517
00:25:30,402 --> 00:25:32,024
And depending on which statistician you ask,

518
00:25:32,064 --> 00:25:35,588
they'll say, if it's at least five categories,

519
00:25:35,608 --> 00:25:36,569
if it's at least 10 categories,

520
00:25:36,969 --> 00:25:38,031
you can treat it as continuous.

521
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:39,192
But if it's less than that,

522
00:25:39,212 --> 00:25:41,394
you have to treat it as if it were what's called ordinal,

523
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:43,677
where you can't actually assign them to a continuous number.

524
00:25:45,578 --> 00:25:48,920
5 is right at the cusp, so it's kind of a judgment call.

525
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,001
Now that you've mentioned that, I would say, yeah,

526
00:25:51,021 --> 00:25:52,382
you should probably just use the Mann-Whitney.

527
00:25:52,722 --> 00:25:54,803
It's almost as good as the t-test in all scenarios anyway.

528
00:25:54,823 --> 00:25:56,364
All right, thank you.

529
00:25:58,104 --> 00:25:58,645
Any other questions?

530
00:25:58,665 --> 00:26:04,748
All right, I'm gonna skip ahead into the Q&A slide.

531
00:26:06,729 --> 00:26:07,909
So, what if...

532
00:26:09,064 --> 00:26:11,826
your outcome is something that can't be measured as a continuous number.

533
00:26:12,046 --> 00:26:14,568
What if it's something you can't put a score on, but you can just say,

534
00:26:15,268 --> 00:26:16,529
this thing is better than that thing.

535
00:26:16,729 --> 00:26:19,411
Like, what if you can just rank things from best to worst?

536
00:26:20,112 --> 00:26:22,934
Right? Now, you can't look at these things and say that the difference between

537
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:25,756
undiscovered country and first contact is exactly the same as the difference between

538
00:26:25,776 --> 00:26:26,917
search for Spock and the motion picture.

539
00:26:27,297 --> 00:26:30,460
You can just say, which of these things is better than which of the other things.

540
00:26:32,555 --> 00:26:35,437
This test is what the Man Whitney was actually designed to do.

541
00:26:35,497 --> 00:26:37,838
It's called an ordinal outcome because you can only order things.

542
00:26:37,858 --> 00:26:39,659
You can't measure them continuously.

543
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:43,102
So in this case, our predictor is the movie even-numbered or odd-numbered.

544
00:26:43,882 --> 00:26:46,624
And the outcome is, is it good or not?

545
00:26:46,724 --> 00:26:51,948
And we can do the math, do the thing, pop up the numbers, do the thing.

546
00:26:51,968 --> 00:26:54,729
Yeah, and it turns out actually the even-numbered movies aren't better.

547
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:57,191
Or at least to prove it, we'd need like 30 of them.

548
00:27:02,657 --> 00:27:04,380
Yeah, it's time to bring in Riker.

549
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:11,512
All right, if there's no other questions, let's all get comfy.
