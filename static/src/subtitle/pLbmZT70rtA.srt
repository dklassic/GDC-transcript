1
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:05,551
Change.

2
00:00:07,573 --> 00:00:08,173
Change.

3
00:00:08,954 --> 00:00:09,495
Oh wait, not that.

4
00:00:09,775 --> 00:00:10,335
Change.

5
00:00:11,096 --> 00:00:11,476
Not that.

6
00:00:11,977 --> 00:00:12,597
Change.

7
00:00:13,018 --> 00:00:18,242
In regards to how comedy is utilized, presented and created in the medium of video games.

8
00:00:19,243 --> 00:00:20,845
And because games are like theatre.

9
00:00:21,585 --> 00:00:21,946
No wait.

10
00:00:22,486 --> 00:00:22,866
No wait.

11
00:00:23,227 --> 00:00:23,887
Oh, it's not even here.

12
00:00:23,947 --> 00:00:24,388
Is it here?

13
00:00:24,728 --> 00:00:24,928
Yes.

14
00:00:25,228 --> 00:00:25,409
Yes.

15
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:26,089
That bit.

16
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:26,750
There.

17
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:27,871
Act one.

18
00:00:27,951 --> 00:00:28,872
Beginning of act one.

19
00:00:29,032 --> 00:00:29,592
Starting great.

20
00:00:29,993 --> 00:00:31,394
So, I'm William Pugh.

21
00:00:32,076 --> 00:00:35,759
I co-created the 2013 game The Stanley Parable

22
00:00:35,819 --> 00:00:37,740
with a guy called Davey Reardon over in America,

23
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,261
but he's not here and I'm here,

24
00:00:39,341 --> 00:00:40,982
so I get to just take all the credit.

25
00:00:41,062 --> 00:00:42,143
It was me. It was all me.

26
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:44,785
But, yeah, just applaud.

27
00:00:46,786 --> 00:00:47,046
Oh, yeah.

28
00:00:47,126 --> 00:00:49,048
See, this is just ego food for me right now.

29
00:00:49,368 --> 00:00:49,808
Oh, yeah.

30
00:00:50,169 --> 00:00:52,610
But, you know, enough jokes.

31
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,492
Let's get down to the humor.

32
00:00:57,456 --> 00:01:00,058
I'm going to talk about comedy and games that use comedy.

33
00:01:00,098 --> 00:01:01,138
They're different, alright?

34
00:01:01,418 --> 00:01:04,120
Comedy games are designed from the ground up to be funny,

35
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:08,743
like Surgeon Simulator or Goat Simulator or something like that.

36
00:01:09,003 --> 00:01:11,304
And games that use comedy are mechanical games

37
00:01:11,345 --> 00:01:15,147
that add comedy bits and bobs to improve the experience overall.

38
00:01:15,187 --> 00:01:17,488
So like Portal or Portal 2.

39
00:01:18,088 --> 00:01:19,528
and there's a blurred line between them,

40
00:01:19,588 --> 00:01:21,649
and I think that's probably where the Stanley Parable sits.

41
00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:24,450
But let's forget the Stanley Parable for a moment.

42
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:25,871
Let's go back in time.

43
00:01:25,891 --> 00:01:29,992
In 2016, no, in 2006, a friend of mine

44
00:01:30,232 --> 00:01:32,073
was interning at Valve Software,

45
00:01:32,113 --> 00:01:32,953
and back in those days,

46
00:01:33,013 --> 00:01:34,634
before they were content to make millions.

47
00:01:36,572 --> 00:01:37,553
they actually made games.

48
00:01:37,573 --> 00:01:40,536
the interactive medium. Now, truly, some of the greatest men and women were, like, fought

49
00:01:40,556 --> 00:01:41,917
with this never-before-heard tale.

50
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:03,358
The first team was Fast Off The Mask,

51
00:02:03,758 --> 00:02:04,980
or it was Fast Off The Mark,

52
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,103
led by the writer Eric Walpaugh.

53
00:02:07,384 --> 00:02:09,547
He had a vision for a game that transcended

54
00:02:09,567 --> 00:02:11,209
the mechanics-driven monotony

55
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,732
that pervaded the industry at the time.

56
00:02:12,792 --> 00:02:15,636
He envisioned a game without gameplay.

57
00:02:16,197 --> 00:02:18,218
with no restrictions for the writer.

58
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:21,060
When the rest of Valve saw this, he'd never have to write

59
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,562
another Combine Soldier reloading line again.

60
00:02:23,622 --> 00:02:26,264
He'd be free to lead the creative charge, right?

61
00:02:26,284 --> 00:02:28,645
With no restrictions.

62
00:02:29,026 --> 00:02:32,128
Without the structure enforced by traditional notions of gameplay

63
00:02:32,368 --> 00:02:33,869
that we've held since, like, the 90s,

64
00:02:34,169 --> 00:02:37,171
he could reach heights of storytelling and narrative freedom

65
00:02:37,271 --> 00:02:38,552
and immersion and jokes

66
00:02:38,873 --> 00:02:41,795
never before imagined by human beings or gamers.

67
00:02:42,722 --> 00:02:46,304
But sure, he might not have known what it was going to look like exactly, but...

68
00:02:47,104 --> 00:02:50,265
You know, as old Grandpa Walpole had told him many years before, he said,

69
00:02:50,885 --> 00:02:55,147
Son, if you don't understand what your concept will look like once it's built,

70
00:02:55,447 --> 00:02:58,188
it lies outside of the conventions you hold.

71
00:02:58,268 --> 00:03:02,110
Therefore, it will not only surprise yourself, but your peers too.

72
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:03,290
Eh?

73
00:03:04,731 --> 00:03:05,391
Eh? Right.

74
00:03:05,717 --> 00:03:07,158
That's important, by the way.

75
00:03:07,338 --> 00:03:08,779
If you're writing notes, write that one down,

76
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:09,340
because that's good.

77
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,782
But, you know, old man Wolpar had decided,

78
00:03:12,603 --> 00:03:14,344
like his job, he wasn't a game developer,

79
00:03:14,585 --> 00:03:17,267
but he designed safety devices for automobiles.

80
00:03:17,327 --> 00:03:20,550
So his philosophy might not have suited his kind of profession entirely.

81
00:03:21,031 --> 00:03:25,317
But Eric heard those words echo in his head, and so he got down to work.

82
00:03:25,637 --> 00:03:30,164
However, as he had spent most of the day philosophizing and thinking about heady concepts,

83
00:03:30,424 --> 00:03:33,649
all of the technically talented people at Valve had joined other teams.

84
00:03:33,809 --> 00:03:36,713
So you just had a texture artist and Jeff the coffee guy.

85
00:03:37,565 --> 00:03:40,167
But they embraced their limitations, like true indies,

86
00:03:40,207 --> 00:03:44,071
and produced a game with no barrier of gameplay or interactivity.

87
00:03:44,351 --> 00:03:44,532
Right?

88
00:03:44,912 --> 00:03:46,894
A piece that allowed Eric's inner thoughts

89
00:03:47,134 --> 00:03:49,997
to be completely communicated directly to the player.

90
00:03:50,217 --> 00:03:52,039
His masterpiece was completed quickly,

91
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,521
and he proudly presented Gabe with...

92
00:03:55,142 --> 00:03:57,144
Four Jokes by Eric Walpaw.

93
00:03:57,424 --> 00:03:58,605
And we're gonna look at that now.

94
00:03:59,406 --> 00:03:59,726
Oh yeah.

95
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:00,547
Play.

96
00:04:20,979 --> 00:04:23,281
Now we mixed up the next one. This is a visual joke.

97
00:04:27,585 --> 00:04:32,489
Yeah. Yeah. And the last one returns back to the text.

98
00:04:35,211 --> 00:04:42,337
Yeah. Yeah. And then that ends. And the player turns around if they want to see the jokes again.

99
00:04:42,417 --> 00:04:44,058
And jokes are only funny once.

100
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:48,751
Now, Eric was playing with fire here.

101
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,834
Sure, he'd removed gameplay from the equation,

102
00:04:50,894 --> 00:04:52,696
but did that make it any better?

103
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:54,520
I don't know.

104
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,461
He replaced the structure that Half-Life 2 gave him

105
00:04:57,521 --> 00:04:58,781
and replaced it with something else.

106
00:04:58,941 --> 00:05:00,602
It was a step in the right direction,

107
00:05:01,022 --> 00:05:03,423
but perhaps just writing good jokes wasn't good enough.

108
00:05:03,763 --> 00:05:06,544
Gabe didn't really feel engaged by four jokes

109
00:05:06,604 --> 00:05:08,624
by a Rick Walport and decreed that making a good

110
00:05:08,664 --> 00:05:10,445
comedy game is a design problem

111
00:05:10,745 --> 00:05:12,325
as much as it's a writing problem.

112
00:05:12,605 --> 00:05:13,906
And you can't argue with me about that

113
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:14,886
because I didn't say that.

114
00:05:15,246 --> 00:05:20,008
Gabe said that, and he is, like, well smart,

115
00:05:20,808 --> 00:05:22,208
and he knows what he's talking about.

116
00:05:23,132 --> 00:05:25,493
So, you know, it's good stuff. Good stuff.

117
00:05:25,933 --> 00:05:28,574
Right, so Eric nodded his head to Gabe and agreed.

118
00:05:28,714 --> 00:05:33,056
He knew that he wasn't talking about funny design like Octodad or Surgeon Simulator.

119
00:05:33,096 --> 00:05:36,977
He was talking about creating a structure in the game that allowed writers

120
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:42,020
to write jokes that fundamentally incorporated the notion of player interaction.

121
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,141
And that's what games are about, aren't they?

122
00:05:44,161 --> 00:05:45,562
They're like immersive theater.

123
00:05:45,883 --> 00:05:47,664
The player is integral to the message

124
00:05:47,704 --> 00:05:48,665
that they're trying to convey

125
00:05:48,985 --> 00:05:50,506
and the jokes that they're trying to tell.

126
00:05:50,787 --> 00:05:52,948
And if you make the player walk through a bunch of rooms

127
00:05:53,008 --> 00:05:54,149
and write jokes at them,

128
00:05:54,349 --> 00:05:56,731
they won't feel engaged and connect with what you're doing.

129
00:05:57,051 --> 00:05:59,433
Eric knew he'd have to change his approach,

130
00:05:59,473 --> 00:06:01,355
but hey, they'd worked out something

131
00:06:01,395 --> 00:06:02,796
about environmental storytelling,

132
00:06:02,836 --> 00:06:04,137
what with the writing on the walls,

133
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:07,019
and Eric's design idea evolved to become Left 4 Dead.

134
00:06:08,481 --> 00:06:10,622
Hey, yeah, realistic.

135
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:11,263
However.

136
00:06:12,577 --> 00:06:15,319
Another force was lurking at the edge of this meeting room.

137
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:19,082
The writer Chet Falicek rubbed his hands together gleefully.

138
00:06:19,102 --> 00:06:20,543
Right?

139
00:06:21,203 --> 00:06:23,905
And he ran back to his cabal and explained to them

140
00:06:24,146 --> 00:06:26,768
exactly how they should make their prototype.

141
00:06:26,788 --> 00:06:28,209
He saw Eric's flaw.

142
00:06:28,409 --> 00:06:33,093
He cackled with malice and explained in an American accent,

143
00:06:33,113 --> 00:06:34,774
which I can't do, so we'll make him British.

144
00:06:36,337 --> 00:06:41,599
We must let the writing inform the design, and the design inform the writing, chaps."

145
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:43,920
His underlings nodded and got to work.

146
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:49,543
They worked for five days and five nights and produced something that fundamentally improved upon Eric's game.

147
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:02,299
Now, Chet knew he couldn't just use the same mechanics and structure as the previous game

148
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:03,940
and just slap more writing on the wall.

149
00:07:04,361 --> 00:07:04,841
Valve.

150
00:07:05,261 --> 00:07:07,083
But, you know, Valve law dictated,

151
00:07:07,383 --> 00:07:08,424
show, don't tell.

152
00:07:08,684 --> 00:07:11,306
But Chet amended it to involve, don't show.

153
00:07:11,326 --> 00:07:12,167
Huh?

154
00:07:12,828 --> 00:07:13,028
Er...

155
00:07:14,049 --> 00:07:14,769
Yeah, check it out.

156
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:16,711
Player clicks on the door,

157
00:07:17,191 --> 00:07:17,612
knocks,

158
00:07:18,352 --> 00:07:18,973
responds,

159
00:07:19,073 --> 00:07:19,794
they click again,

160
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,515
for spell, spell him, and...

161
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:22,716
Joke.

162
00:07:24,558 --> 00:07:24,878
Yeah.

163
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:26,039
Yeah.

164
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,281
Like, he wasn't writing a play. He wasn't writing a book.

165
00:07:29,401 --> 00:07:32,222
He knew the play needed to be enmeshed in the world he was creating.

166
00:07:32,442 --> 00:07:35,623
He was making his game a conversation.

167
00:07:35,643 --> 00:07:37,164
Right? And that's the end.

168
00:07:37,184 --> 00:07:39,965
And then they might turn around.

169
00:07:40,205 --> 00:07:42,886
And jokes can be funny twice if you change them into a callback.

170
00:07:44,587 --> 00:07:46,888
That was the cleverest joke of the talk.

171
00:07:47,788 --> 00:07:48,588
I hope you enjoyed it.

172
00:07:49,829 --> 00:07:51,169
So, come on, you.

173
00:07:51,849 --> 00:07:55,253
Chet R surveyed the paradigm of interactive humor he'd created,

174
00:07:55,473 --> 00:07:56,374
and he knew he'd done well.

175
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,516
So he took a copy home on a USB,

176
00:07:58,796 --> 00:08:01,079
he walked into his house, he went up to his attic,

177
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,302
and he placed the USB on a shrine he'd created

178
00:08:04,842 --> 00:08:07,145
to the spirit of games writing.

179
00:08:07,745 --> 00:08:16,792
He spoke the magic words and the shrine came to life and a ghostly figure picked up the USB and plugged it directly into its ghostly laptop computer, right?

180
00:08:17,052 --> 00:08:18,793
Chet spoke to the spirit and said,

181
00:08:18,994 --> 00:08:22,916
Oh, great spirit of games writing, what do you think of this game that I created?

182
00:08:23,517 --> 00:08:25,778
And, uh, the ghost spoke in this voice.

183
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:27,340
Look, Chet.

184
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:32,813
If you're writing a comedy game, write it like comedy, not like a sodding joke book, yeah?

185
00:08:33,033 --> 00:08:35,114
I'm talking about callbacks, Chet.

186
00:08:35,394 --> 00:08:38,475
A consistent character that develops over the course of the work.

187
00:08:38,776 --> 00:08:41,317
Design your game so the player's inherently involved.

188
00:08:41,357 --> 00:08:45,699
This all ties into how you should be designing and writing jokes for your games, Chet.

189
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:46,640
Involve your player.

190
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,220
And then Chet responded with,

191
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,501
no, but I'm already involving the player.

192
00:08:50,521 --> 00:08:51,382
It's like you're knocking the door.

193
00:08:51,422 --> 00:08:53,083
And the ghost responded angrily.

194
00:08:53,103 --> 00:08:54,063
He was like, silence!

195
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:56,845
You are merely having your player act out the script.

196
00:08:57,265 --> 00:09:00,710
With no options or granularity when it comes to player interaction,

197
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:03,354
you've done no better than your predecessor, Chet.

198
00:09:03,854 --> 00:09:04,856
And then Chet responded.

199
00:09:04,876 --> 00:09:06,979
They're like, hey, hey, come on.

200
00:09:08,212 --> 00:09:10,054
I thought it was, and then the ghost cut him off again,

201
00:09:10,314 --> 00:09:12,415
saying like, whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm not finished.

202
00:09:12,796 --> 00:09:14,717
Why is there no voice acting?

203
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:16,958
Why are you telling jokes via text?

204
00:09:17,219 --> 00:09:17,439
Right?

205
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,701
If there's voiceover, your actor will do 90% of the work.

206
00:09:20,881 --> 00:09:23,483
They're also human beings and are unpredictable.

207
00:09:23,543 --> 00:09:25,304
With this in mind, you could write a lot of short,

208
00:09:25,424 --> 00:09:27,746
extra jokes and incidental dialogue.

209
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:30,088
In the recording booth, you will be surprised

210
00:09:30,148 --> 00:09:31,929
by how actors deliver things.

211
00:09:33,274 --> 00:09:36,636
You don't have to think every extra bonus line you write is brilliant,

212
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:41,099
but good actors can make lines you think are average sing in ways you'd never expect.

213
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:46,603
Knowing this, you'll find a lot of great, cheap content for you to tuck away behind corners for players to discover.

214
00:09:46,863 --> 00:09:48,024
And Chet paused and asked,

215
00:09:48,805 --> 00:09:49,565
Are you Steve Gaynor?

216
00:09:51,361 --> 00:09:52,702
And then they go shouting, no, no!

217
00:09:53,662 --> 00:09:55,123
You're getting advice, right?

218
00:09:55,423 --> 00:09:58,884
From the f***ing ghost of writing or whatever I am.

219
00:09:59,985 --> 00:10:01,305
Just pay attention, alright?

220
00:10:01,385 --> 00:10:05,887
Adding this, adding the extra content will balloon playtimes massively.

221
00:10:05,927 --> 00:10:09,909
Just be prepared for that by designing your game so it doesn't waste your players' time.

222
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:11,209
Keep the pace fast.

223
00:10:11,249 --> 00:10:16,012
I mean, I had to fast forward that video earlier because all your jokes needed the same repeated setup.

224
00:10:16,332 --> 00:10:22,956
If the player knows what's coming, they'll get bored, and you're also missing a fantastic opportunity to subvert expectations.

225
00:10:23,036 --> 00:10:28,420
Now, as Chet and the ghost of spirit thing argued back and forth, right?

226
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,902
Neither of them noticed a figure slip away from the window.

227
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:35,665
That figure had heard everything. He'd seen Chet's game. He knew what he had to do.

228
00:10:35,925 --> 00:10:38,146
That's right! Tim Schafer heard everything.

229
00:10:38,206 --> 00:10:42,789
He rode back to Double Fine on his motorcycle and called an emergency meeting.

230
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,831
They would start work immediately.

231
00:10:45,307 --> 00:10:51,291
on a brand new game. Tim Schafer's Jokerama. Right?

232
00:10:52,692 --> 00:10:59,856
So, oh. Now Jokerama used some of Chet's door idea

233
00:11:00,424 --> 00:11:02,547
combined with Eric's corridor gameplay,

234
00:11:02,967 --> 00:11:04,629
but he added in an important twist.

235
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,332
At several points throughout the game,

236
00:11:06,672 --> 00:11:07,773
the player would make a choice,

237
00:11:08,054 --> 00:11:10,216
and that game would split off and riff off

238
00:11:10,276 --> 00:11:12,539
whatever the player, whatever the choice the player made.

239
00:11:12,619 --> 00:11:14,161
And I don't have a copy here to show you,

240
00:11:14,201 --> 00:11:16,805
but take my word for it that it was pretty special

241
00:11:16,865 --> 00:11:19,828
and too complex to actually make for just a talk.

242
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:21,003
like the other games.

243
00:11:21,363 --> 00:11:22,185
But no, it was pretty...

244
00:11:22,585 --> 00:11:23,807
No, and it's real, it's real,

245
00:11:23,987 --> 00:11:25,329
and it was pretty special, okay?

246
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:28,754
So, it was structured like a small stand-up set,

247
00:11:28,894 --> 00:11:32,179
but callbacks and jokes were based around the player's actions

248
00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:35,123
rather than being predetermined six months before the game was built.

249
00:11:36,165 --> 00:11:39,487
Tim Schaefer playtested this for, like, 90 days and 90 nights,

250
00:11:39,567 --> 00:11:40,728
iterating constantly.

251
00:11:40,948 --> 00:11:42,569
He hid jokes everywhere he did.

252
00:11:42,609 --> 00:11:44,970
They called him the joke hider back where I came from, you know.

253
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:47,511
He'd go and hide funny textures and little skits

254
00:11:47,591 --> 00:11:48,652
behind odd interactions.

255
00:11:48,692 --> 00:11:50,353
He'd see players try and playtesting.

256
00:11:50,673 --> 00:11:53,435
And he'd say stuff to his staff on a near hourly basis,

257
00:11:53,495 --> 00:11:56,997
like, they won't see them all, but it'll make the game feel

258
00:11:57,037 --> 00:11:58,798
really kind of full of humor and nice.

259
00:11:58,958 --> 00:11:59,818
It'll make it feel nice.

260
00:12:00,739 --> 00:12:02,219
That's what Tim sounds like.

261
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,921
I have limited voices.

262
00:12:06,287 --> 00:12:08,950
But one errant designer said in brave defiance,

263
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:11,472
but Tim, Mr. Schaefer, joke hider,

264
00:12:12,013 --> 00:12:14,655
why are we making all this content that players won't see?

265
00:12:14,956 --> 00:12:17,358
Why don't I just add a few extra design tricks

266
00:12:17,858 --> 00:12:19,620
and point out these secrets to the player?

267
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:22,022
Like add a light over here to guide the player's

268
00:12:22,162 --> 00:12:24,285
eyesight, pop a bit of signage to lead the player

269
00:12:24,305 --> 00:12:26,266
to the kind of secrets so they can see more content.

270
00:12:26,647 --> 00:12:29,088
And an old Tim Schafer was enraged by this.

271
00:12:29,128 --> 00:12:31,150
He slapped his designer across the face.

272
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:32,591
Oh, it made a horrible mark.

273
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:35,993
Oh, he slapped him again, back and forth, back and forth.

274
00:12:36,033 --> 00:12:37,074
He went all over the shop.

275
00:12:37,354 --> 00:12:38,375
Tim Schafer looked at him,

276
00:12:38,615 --> 00:12:40,896
and he looked with rage in his eyes, right?

277
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,778
And he said something that employee would never forget.

278
00:12:44,567 --> 00:12:46,508
The less you try and push players towards secrets,

279
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:49,129
the obvious design decisions, the less special it is

280
00:12:49,189 --> 00:12:50,169
for them to discover them.

281
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:52,750
If you hide 10 secrets and they discover one,

282
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,871
that one secret will be memorable

283
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:57,472
and make their experience incredibly unique.

284
00:12:57,912 --> 00:13:00,833
Unique player experiences, link into viral marketing

285
00:13:00,893 --> 00:13:02,213
and YouTube Let's Plays.

286
00:13:02,254 --> 00:13:04,034
And I know we're doing this for the art,

287
00:13:04,194 --> 00:13:06,375
but if we can help, you know, sell the game,

288
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:07,775
that's a nice bonus.

289
00:13:08,636 --> 00:13:09,356
It's a nice bonus.

290
00:13:10,176 --> 00:13:12,677
But Tim Schafer had gone a bit secret crazy, right?

291
00:13:13,658 --> 00:13:14,078
So, uh.

292
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:20,161
And he knew that himself, like, legends have it he stayed in his office until about five in the morning every night

293
00:13:20,181 --> 00:13:23,022
just adding secret joke after secret joke after secret joke.

294
00:13:23,282 --> 00:13:27,463
And he was wandering home after a drunken night of joke writing, and he lucked up to the moon.

295
00:13:27,763 --> 00:13:29,864
And much to his surprise, it spoke to him.

296
00:13:30,264 --> 00:13:30,684
And it said...

297
00:13:30,704 --> 00:13:32,824
Tim!

298
00:13:36,585 --> 00:13:38,346
I didn't have that voice prepared, that just came out.

299
00:13:38,546 --> 00:13:38,766
Tim!

300
00:13:39,505 --> 00:13:42,565
You need to be sensible about this hidden joke stuff.

301
00:13:42,885 --> 00:13:45,226
You're too wild, man, too wild.

302
00:13:45,546 --> 00:13:48,707
As a rough guideline, you'll want to hide secret jokes

303
00:13:48,987 --> 00:13:52,448
that maintain the pace and feel of the area they're placed in.

304
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:56,829
If you want a section to be snappy, hide some fun visual stuff

305
00:13:56,909 --> 00:13:59,409
rather than elaborate five-minute skits.

306
00:13:59,729 --> 00:14:02,830
Hey, you could even add a procedural callback system

307
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:05,851
that remembers the side jokes players have seen

308
00:14:06,151 --> 00:14:09,412
and then tailors future jokes to involve that theme or reference.

309
00:14:09,992 --> 00:14:10,934
And then Tim responded,

310
00:14:11,515 --> 00:14:12,836
yeah, yeah, most of that's good,

311
00:14:12,937 --> 00:14:15,060
but that last part sounds a bit hard to implement

312
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,842
and write, so I'm not doing that.

313
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:19,386
And Amun said, yeah, okay, I understand.

314
00:14:19,846 --> 00:14:22,370
And Tim said, yeah, and the players,

315
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:24,974
the players wouldn't even notice something that complex

316
00:14:25,034 --> 00:14:25,595
to do with like.

317
00:14:26,147 --> 00:14:28,048
procedural joke callbacks. And the moon said,

318
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,909
yeah, in fact, actually, I bet you could just

319
00:14:30,969 --> 00:14:34,031
randomize those jokes and players would infer some sort

320
00:14:34,051 --> 00:14:36,592
of complex system on it. I bet, I bet they'd

321
00:14:36,632 --> 00:14:38,713
think your game would be doing some crazy strange

322
00:14:38,773 --> 00:14:41,114
back-end logic when all you're really doing is calling

323
00:14:41,194 --> 00:14:45,696
random dialogue variations. Tim. And then Tim said, yeah,

324
00:14:45,796 --> 00:14:48,397
but I bet if you made that game you'd

325
00:14:48,417 --> 00:14:50,538
probably be the kind of type of wanker who'd

326
00:14:50,678 --> 00:14:52,679
do a talk at GDC and then use some kind of

327
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:56,491
fake story character nonsense to talk about your game as a metaphor.

328
00:14:57,612 --> 00:15:03,294
And the moon agreed, yeah, and they'd probably go and reference that in a weird meta sort of way.

329
00:15:04,894 --> 00:15:10,236
And Tim responded, yeah, the audience would probably initially think it's funny and clever.

330
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:12,737
They'd like laugh, you know.

331
00:15:12,997 --> 00:15:18,078
But then they'd kind of quickly realize that it's just a ploy to waste time.

332
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:22,931
because he applied for the talk

333
00:15:23,611 --> 00:15:26,673
because he didn't have a pass

334
00:15:27,313 --> 00:15:30,015
and he really wanted to get one for free.

335
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:33,777
And he gave a really vague talk description

336
00:15:34,258 --> 00:15:36,219
and then he had to write something

337
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,460
and he didn't know what to write.

338
00:15:40,361 --> 00:15:44,384
And then the other one, I can't remember which one, said...

339
00:15:45,716 --> 00:15:48,919
But once he went down that road, he'd be a bit stuck, wouldn't he?

340
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:52,904
He'd just be narrating two people talking to each other.

341
00:15:54,986 --> 00:15:56,387
And then the other one said,

342
00:15:57,348 --> 00:15:58,189
Yeah, he would be.

343
00:16:01,433 --> 00:16:04,176
He'd need to do something really clever

344
00:16:05,537 --> 00:16:07,579
in order to segue out of this.

345
00:16:19,162 --> 00:16:19,603
Act two.

346
00:16:20,184 --> 00:16:25,731
Yeah.

347
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:26,031
Okay.

348
00:16:26,532 --> 00:16:27,273
Oh yeah, the time.

349
00:16:27,673 --> 00:16:31,218
I've written here how long it'll take me to get to this point, and it's fine.

350
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:32,419
Everything's going really well.

351
00:16:34,482 --> 00:16:34,803
And so...

352
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:39,112
Basically, legend has it that all of Tim Schafer's prototype was stolen.

353
00:16:39,192 --> 00:16:44,714
Nobody knew who by, but Tim's multiple door, non-linear, repeatable game featuring jokes

354
00:16:44,774 --> 00:16:49,456
in corridors was likely developed into some sort of commercial product that I'm sure is

355
00:16:49,636 --> 00:16:52,778
unrecognizable from that bland and silly description.

356
00:16:52,858 --> 00:16:57,900
But alas, we may never know what those despicable thieves did with that beautiful concept and

357
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,141
what they perverted it into.

358
00:16:59,301 --> 00:17:02,522
Anyway, let's talk a bit about the Stanley Parable on a different notion.

359
00:17:02,542 --> 00:17:02,662
So um...

360
00:17:07,147 --> 00:17:08,428
Now it's the actual talk.

361
00:17:09,668 --> 00:17:12,750
The spaces in between the choices are the best to design, for me.

362
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:17,092
I mean, whenever I was designing a space for the player to choose a path in a game, I knew

363
00:17:17,112 --> 00:17:21,514
it had to be a quiet space for the player to think about things, to talk back to themselves

364
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:25,256
where they'd never, where they'd been before, or what they thought lie behind each choice,

365
00:17:25,356 --> 00:17:29,498
and then try, with no information to justify, red over blue, or left over right.

366
00:17:29,978 --> 00:17:32,679
and the spaces in between those kind of moments

367
00:17:32,959 --> 00:17:36,521
were really fun to play with because the only technical kind of requirement

368
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:40,263
of that, of those spaces, is that they just get you to the next choice

369
00:17:40,423 --> 00:17:43,744
so that's like time that you can do with anything you can like

370
00:17:44,345 --> 00:17:48,046
like within the structure of the game you can play with anything you can like

371
00:17:48,086 --> 00:17:48,667
write anything

372
00:17:48,907 --> 00:17:52,428
basically and took it behind the corner so the player can like

373
00:17:53,167 --> 00:17:56,387
you know, find it out. So, like, early on we started by blocking out the corridors,

374
00:17:56,648 --> 00:18:00,249
and then we just really played for a long time. We, like, reiterated everything about

375
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:00,769
three times,

376
00:18:01,229 --> 00:18:03,770
and we just, you know, had a good play. But I suppose in games

377
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:07,651
where levels have to serve a greater definition of gameplay, like having the

378
00:18:07,771 --> 00:18:10,051
area of fun to navigate while shooting bad guys,

379
00:18:10,371 --> 00:18:13,312
or needing the level to teach the player how to solve puzzles, I suppose

380
00:18:14,413 --> 00:18:17,693
that would be much harder to achieve. If your player gets distracted by a joke

381
00:18:17,713 --> 00:18:18,414
written on the floor,

382
00:18:18,694 --> 00:18:21,975
they might forget some vital information that you needed to communicate to them about.

383
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,965
weapons or reloading or whatever.

384
00:18:24,985 --> 00:18:27,206
I don't care.

385
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,408
But if you're making a comedy game,

386
00:18:29,688 --> 00:18:31,049
you do really wanna have it,

387
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:32,770
do you really wanna have its central focus

388
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:34,571
be kind of technically complex gameplay?

389
00:18:34,932 --> 00:18:35,772
If the answer is yes,

390
00:18:35,812 --> 00:18:38,474
then you can still use the hidden secret stuff in downtime

391
00:18:38,814 --> 00:18:40,896
or in areas where you don't need the player to focus.

392
00:18:41,076 --> 00:18:42,477
So, yeah.

393
00:18:42,697 --> 00:18:43,998
So in one of these moments

394
00:18:44,258 --> 00:18:46,140
that I made between the bigger choice sections,

395
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,901
it was this thing called the broom closet.

396
00:18:49,197 --> 00:18:52,019
And here's the nice interactive part of the talk

397
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:53,881
that I probably should have done at the start.

398
00:18:53,941 --> 00:18:55,682
Who here has actually played the Stanley Parable?

399
00:18:57,584 --> 00:18:59,986
Ah. OK. That's really hard to judge.

400
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:01,647
Who here has not played the Stanley Parable?

401
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,650
OK. I'm really sorry, everybody.

402
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:05,510
All of you.

403
00:19:06,711 --> 00:19:07,292
Yeah. Well.

404
00:19:09,794 --> 00:19:10,534
Might as well just go.

405
00:19:11,235 --> 00:19:12,396
Dunno, dunno why you even came here.

406
00:19:14,814 --> 00:19:16,175
No, don't actually leave, because, like...

407
00:19:16,795 --> 00:19:18,595
No, it's good, it's fine. That was a joke.

408
00:19:18,695 --> 00:19:20,476
It didn't hit as well as I thought it would, but...

409
00:19:20,896 --> 00:19:21,476
But, okay.

410
00:19:22,677 --> 00:19:24,837
Moving on, I really enjoyed players

411
00:19:24,877 --> 00:19:26,778
going through the kind of room closet, going in,

412
00:19:26,838 --> 00:19:28,418
waiting, have the narrator talk to them.

413
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:30,919
It felt like a step outside of my design

414
00:19:30,939 --> 00:19:32,680
philosophy a bit, because during the core

415
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,001
of that skit, there's no actual tactile

416
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,081
interaction going on.

417
00:19:36,421 --> 00:19:38,082
The player is just kind of waiting about,

418
00:19:38,402 --> 00:19:39,862
but the only option they have at...

419
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,863
like, that time, is to leave the broom closet,

420
00:19:42,983 --> 00:19:45,364
and the only option they have is when they're gonna do that.

421
00:19:46,204 --> 00:19:49,245
And that somehow makes it feel like a back and forth

422
00:19:49,325 --> 00:19:50,706
between the narrator and the player,

423
00:19:51,046 --> 00:19:53,367
even if we're just playing lines with, like, a time delay.

424
00:19:53,647 --> 00:19:56,408
However, I also do think that the broom closet

425
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:59,029
flirts a bit with an unhelpful facet of comedy games,

426
00:19:59,189 --> 00:20:00,650
and that's waiting dialogue.

427
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:03,671
Waiting dialogue is fun, guys.

428
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:04,351
We get it.

429
00:20:05,267 --> 00:20:07,408
You know, where, like, your player's waiting around,

430
00:20:07,468 --> 00:20:08,209
and the writers are like,

431
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:10,690
we've got nothing to do for 90% of development,

432
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,831
so we'll write loads of funny little jokes

433
00:20:12,891 --> 00:20:13,912
for the characters to say,

434
00:20:14,252 --> 00:20:16,893
while, like, the player's not doing what the game's about.

435
00:20:17,703 --> 00:20:20,326
But if you only hide extras in waiting around,

436
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:23,169
then you're tying content to player inaction.

437
00:20:23,609 --> 00:20:25,191
And if you let the player play about,

438
00:20:25,271 --> 00:20:27,273
like tie content to exploration and play,

439
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:30,036
again we're talking about games as a conversation,

440
00:20:30,136 --> 00:20:31,858
rather than asking the player to sit still

441
00:20:31,978 --> 00:20:33,020
and listen to the writer.

442
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,042
Moments of quiet are also important,

443
00:20:35,302 --> 00:20:36,964
and a space without waiting dialogue

444
00:20:37,024 --> 00:20:38,205
can definitely provide that.

445
00:20:40,308 --> 00:20:45,271
So we had to kind of make a determined effort to try and cut down as much as we could on waiting about

446
00:20:45,632 --> 00:20:49,154
and rewarding players for waiting about. So we tried to kind of incentivize them

447
00:20:49,554 --> 00:20:53,057
through like experience for them to like, if they see something weird, click on it.

448
00:20:53,417 --> 00:20:59,202
If they like see two doors opposite each other, try closing them both and maybe you'll get a little joke or a section.

449
00:21:00,182 --> 00:21:06,707
So it was kind of a way of trying to teach the players to play about and to kind of...

450
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:10,583
have a bit more fun and not try and find content through boring means.

451
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,885
And if you get your playfulness from players waiting around,

452
00:21:15,945 --> 00:21:18,546
they'll miss 90% of it in the latter half of your game.

453
00:21:18,906 --> 00:21:21,347
And that really skews the distribution of joke stuff

454
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:22,367
to the first half.

455
00:21:22,887 --> 00:21:24,888
And you'll want players to be focusing on learning

456
00:21:24,928 --> 00:21:26,048
how to interact with your game.

457
00:21:26,128 --> 00:21:27,728
If you could find a way to do both of these

458
00:21:27,768 --> 00:21:29,529
at the same time, that'd be pretty cool.

459
00:21:29,549 --> 00:21:32,049
It's kind of like improvisation in a stand-up comedy set.

460
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:34,230
They'll often play around in the first act,

461
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:36,351
and the audience will be like, oh wow, this is cool.

462
00:21:36,451 --> 00:21:38,891
And then the audience will be kind of out of energy

463
00:21:38,931 --> 00:21:41,192
by the second half, and then you've just gotta kind of

464
00:21:42,352 --> 00:21:42,692
go and.

465
00:21:43,193 --> 00:21:45,616
talk serious stuff. It's meta, it's about my talk.

466
00:21:46,176 --> 00:21:47,378
If you, if you didn't get that.

467
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,843
Yeah, the energy thing. Yeah, that's, that's, I didn't feel that.

468
00:21:53,505 --> 00:21:55,588
So another thing to think about is repetition.

469
00:21:55,928 --> 00:21:59,633
Jokes heard again and again, they're not only not funny, they're annoying.

470
00:22:00,317 --> 00:22:05,458
If your player moves through an area more than once, or if your game is designed so they will have to repeat content,

471
00:22:05,698 --> 00:22:07,959
listen to me now. Randomize assets.

472
00:22:08,479 --> 00:22:10,860
Add variants in every way that you can.

473
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:16,102
Repeated content usually stems from a facet of your design that just kinda has to be.

474
00:22:16,142 --> 00:22:18,463
You can't design around it. It's what your game is.

475
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:19,523
And, um...

476
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:26,184
It's okay, nobody's perfect, and you can't always design a game, you know, that isn't repetitive in some aspect.

477
00:22:26,444 --> 00:22:31,007
And in fact, a level of repetition gives you a bunch of great options to subvert and call back.

478
00:22:31,387 --> 00:22:36,730
But in reality, you can't always redesign the entire basis for your game to fix the flawed assumption about...

479
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:41,220
your game. So my advice would be to not think, well, if people don't like this, then they

480
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:44,802
just don't get the game. This is just how it is. You need to be applying as many like

481
00:22:44,862 --> 00:22:50,585
plasters and band-aids onto that gaping design wound as possible. If you can find 20 really,

482
00:22:50,645 --> 00:22:54,807
really tiny things to make it a little less painful, then you better be doing all of those

483
00:22:55,108 --> 00:23:00,451
20 things and thinking about how you can find 20 more. So the problem with the Stanley Parable

484
00:23:00,551 --> 00:23:01,852
was the opening section.

485
00:23:02,509 --> 00:23:07,846
If you play 10 endings, that's about 45 seconds of repeated.

486
00:23:08,452 --> 00:23:12,194
content each restart. That's 7.5 minutes of dead time.

487
00:23:12,494 --> 00:23:16,456
Like, time where your player is getting nothing new from you, and that just...

488
00:23:17,017 --> 00:23:19,538
that, like, that might cause players to get bored, say,

489
00:23:19,618 --> 00:23:21,900
okay, I've seen enough content, I've hit a lull,

490
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:26,943
and then, you know, you don't get the funness of players kind of experiencing all of your stuff together,

491
00:23:27,363 --> 00:23:30,785
and, you know, keeping their head in your work throughout the entire piece,

492
00:23:30,965 --> 00:23:32,786
and, like, not splitting it up into chunks or whatever.

493
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:33,666
So, um...

494
00:23:34,991 --> 00:23:42,138
And actually previously we did actually kick the player back to the start menu at the start of after after each ending and that was insane

495
00:23:42,178 --> 00:23:43,800
that added like like

496
00:23:44,224 --> 00:23:46,746
ten, ten minutes to just loading times, which

497
00:23:46,786 --> 00:23:49,529
was completely useless. So the twenty things that

498
00:23:49,549 --> 00:23:51,231
we did to make this section better, the opening

499
00:23:51,251 --> 00:23:53,553
section in Stanley, was to add a lot of

500
00:23:53,593 --> 00:23:56,736
randomizable, like, elements, from the narrator dialogue to the

501
00:23:56,776 --> 00:23:59,299
layout itself. This not only added to the, like,

502
00:23:59,339 --> 00:24:01,000
the mystery feeling of the game, but it also

503
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:04,183
sprinkled more jokes into the repeated sections and gave

504
00:24:04,224 --> 00:24:06,606
the game a feeling of being fresh every restart.

505
00:24:06,686 --> 00:24:08,468
It wasn't kind of knowable. You couldn't.

506
00:24:08,788 --> 00:24:11,468
understand what it was and that kind of felt,

507
00:24:11,608 --> 00:24:14,049
even if the player was playing for the ninth time,

508
00:24:14,109 --> 00:24:16,129
it still felt like, okay, I'm back at the start,

509
00:24:16,169 --> 00:24:17,850
but things have changed, what's changed,

510
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:20,270
what have I done previously to make this change?

511
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:23,411
And I referenced this earlier, where we did,

512
00:24:24,311 --> 00:24:27,132
we did like all this random generation stuff,

513
00:24:27,352 --> 00:24:28,752
but players thought that we were being

514
00:24:28,912 --> 00:24:31,353
much cleverer than we were, and they, you know,

515
00:24:31,393 --> 00:24:33,293
thought that, oh, something I did in this ending

516
00:24:33,393 --> 00:24:35,593
caused the office layout to change and whatever, so.

517
00:24:36,645 --> 00:24:39,049
You know, you don't always have to go the complex route.

518
00:24:39,549 --> 00:24:40,271
You can fake it.

519
00:24:40,731 --> 00:24:41,733
And people won't know.

520
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:42,454
So.

521
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:49,453
So one of the randomized bits and bobs we put in the opening section was a phone in an office that just started ringing.

522
00:24:49,793 --> 00:24:54,135
None of the items in the office ever made any noise or allowed you to interact with them much.

523
00:24:54,275 --> 00:24:58,696
So when the phone rang, it gave the players this new interaction with a world that they'd not had before.

524
00:24:58,776 --> 00:25:00,877
It's off to the side, though, hidden in one of the cubicles.

525
00:25:01,137 --> 00:25:06,739
So if players want to go searching, they can, but if they want to rush on and get to the next ending, there's nothing stopping them.

526
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:07,499
Anyway, so...

527
00:25:08,804 --> 00:25:12,627
You pick up the phone, and we do a little skit about this box delivery company,

528
00:25:12,667 --> 00:25:15,109
and you talk to them on the phone, and you, like, press numbers,

529
00:25:15,149 --> 00:25:19,652
and the skit ends with a player ordering, like, 500,000 boxes to the office,

530
00:25:19,692 --> 00:25:20,453
and, you know, they think,

531
00:25:20,533 --> 00:25:24,396
aha, that's funny, what an inconvenience for the office, ha ha ha.

532
00:25:24,859 --> 00:25:27,560
and they put the phone down and they move on and they play the next ending or whatever.

533
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:32,383
But then, the next restart, we do a callback to that joke and instead of randomizing the office,

534
00:25:32,423 --> 00:25:34,984
we instead force it to fill itself with boxes everywhere.

535
00:25:35,344 --> 00:25:37,625
And it doesn't really change anything gameplay-wise,

536
00:25:37,665 --> 00:25:40,507
but it starts a precedent for those little independent jokes

537
00:25:40,787 --> 00:25:43,088
beginning to link together to form something more.

538
00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:44,789
And even if you just do a few of them,

539
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:48,191
that really, that will start the player thinking, like,

540
00:25:49,512 --> 00:25:51,393
okay, maybe something more complex is going on.

541
00:25:51,473 --> 00:25:52,874
And that helps into the lying thing.

542
00:25:54,194 --> 00:25:54,495
Lying.

543
00:25:55,615 --> 00:26:01,217
Lying. Okay, you're not idiots. It's clear as day that we stole the concept from Tim Schafer's

544
00:26:01,257 --> 00:26:06,618
Jokerama. Chet Faliszek presents five jokes by Chet Faliszek and four jokes by Eric Walpart.

545
00:26:06,678 --> 00:26:11,579
Okay, we stole it. But you know what? Stealing is really, really easy.

546
00:26:13,479 --> 00:26:17,860
I've stolen like 10 jokes in this talk and you won't ever know.

547
00:26:18,768 --> 00:26:20,609
and you all laughed like idiots.

548
00:26:21,369 --> 00:26:23,611
You thought that was funny, when in reality,

549
00:26:24,051 --> 00:26:25,992
I did very little work for that,

550
00:26:26,312 --> 00:26:27,873
and you all thought you enjoyed it.

551
00:26:27,933 --> 00:26:29,694
You didn't enjoy it, but you thought you did,

552
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:30,495
and that's good enough.

553
00:26:31,556 --> 00:26:33,036
So, you know, as long as you,

554
00:26:33,617 --> 00:26:36,078
stealing's really easy, so as long as you don't find out,

555
00:26:36,438 --> 00:26:38,019
you don't get found out, it's fantastic.

556
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:39,420
So like, if you get called,

557
00:26:39,841 --> 00:26:41,261
and if you do get called out on something,

558
00:26:41,341 --> 00:26:43,503
just say, hey dude, it was a really kind of.

559
00:26:44,488 --> 00:26:48,470
formative piece of work and I took a lot of inspiration for it, from it.

560
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:52,071
So, so I'd like you all to repeat this line with me

561
00:26:52,331 --> 00:26:54,732
so you can steal jokes in the future. The phrase is...

562
00:26:55,772 --> 00:26:58,533
Okay, so I'll, I'll say you respond. Hey dude!

563
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:02,515
It was a really formative piece of work.

564
00:27:05,395 --> 00:27:07,716
And I took a lot of inspiration from it.

565
00:27:10,777 --> 00:27:12,298
I am a creative individual.

566
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:15,741
No idea is unique.

567
00:27:15,761 --> 00:27:16,381
No idea is unique.

568
00:27:18,964 --> 00:27:22,207
Inspiration is that, wait, no, not copying.

569
00:27:22,908 --> 00:27:24,570
You know, actually, I didn't even write this bit.

570
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:27,353
It's because I've actually got like this much left

571
00:27:27,834 --> 00:27:29,696
and they just put the five minutes up.

572
00:27:29,736 --> 00:27:31,157
But you know, that killed time

573
00:27:31,477 --> 00:27:32,859
and I get to end on this great joke.

574
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,541
So, if you need an example for how to use that line,

575
00:27:37,062 --> 00:27:40,303
it's, yeah, the Simpsons episode in the box factory

576
00:27:40,343 --> 00:27:42,443
where the guy shows, you know, them around

577
00:27:42,503 --> 00:27:44,624
and shows them, like, the line to walk along.

578
00:27:44,944 --> 00:27:47,985
That was a really formative piece of work.

579
00:27:49,566 --> 00:27:51,367
And I took a lot of inspiration from it.

580
00:27:51,787 --> 00:27:55,688
And online, I've seen nobody call us out on stealing that.

581
00:27:56,328 --> 00:27:58,929
So, yeah, steal your jokes.

582
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:00,890
You can never write that many good ones.

583
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:02,591
Steal them. No one will find out.

584
00:28:02,691 --> 00:28:03,131
And if they do...

585
00:28:04,301 --> 00:28:04,881
Just lie.

586
00:28:07,543 --> 00:28:08,944
Thanks for listening to my talk.

587
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:21,471
We have two minutes left.

588
00:28:21,772 --> 00:28:22,952
We can do one question.

589
00:28:23,192 --> 00:28:24,293
A sole question.

590
00:28:24,613 --> 00:28:26,034
It's whoever goes fast.

591
00:28:26,294 --> 00:28:26,695
Go, run.

592
00:28:26,715 --> 00:28:28,796
Oh, there's one, oh, oh, yes.

593
00:28:28,956 --> 00:28:29,256
Hello.

594
00:28:29,896 --> 00:28:32,998
And the one question is, can I ask that question?

595
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:38,291
You can ask that question.

596
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:45,515
Are you Alex Bruce?

597
00:28:48,236 --> 00:28:49,817
Yeah, did he tell you to say that?

598
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,001
Yeah, so I'm just going to kind of...

599
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:59,282
Like, there was no really great ending bit there,

600
00:28:59,342 --> 00:29:01,003
so I'm just going to walk off stage.
