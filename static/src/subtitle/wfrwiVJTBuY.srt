00:00:04,977 --> 00:00:10,280
Welcome to our talk, Recognizing the Health Risks of Game Development Beyond Carpal Tunnel.

2
00:00:10,901 --> 00:00:19,987
I'm Wendy Despain. We're not in order here, but this is Patricia Pizer and Lydia Breen and Adam Martin.

3
00:00:21,768 --> 00:00:25,510
And, hey, thank you for the one person applauding.

4
00:00:30,734 --> 00:00:32,115
This was kind of a hard talk.

5
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:43,292
to give. I have wanted to give it for a while, but it's hard to get people to do it. So,

6
00:00:45,593 --> 00:00:50,654
genuinely I want you guys to know that these people sitting up here today are the brave

7
00:00:50,734 --> 00:01:00,017
ones. I had asked at least two other fairly famous developers, not that these guys aren't

8
00:01:00,057 --> 00:01:00,697
famous, but...

9
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:05,866
well-known people in the industry who said,

10
00:01:05,926 --> 00:01:07,486
yes, I want to talk on this topic.

11
00:01:07,947 --> 00:01:08,747
This would be great.

12
00:01:09,467 --> 00:01:11,208
And then their PR department found out

13
00:01:11,248 --> 00:01:12,429
what they would be talking about.

14
00:01:12,969 --> 00:01:15,851
And their PR department said, no way

15
00:01:16,211 --> 00:01:17,371
are you talking on this topic.

16
00:01:18,232 --> 00:01:18,392
So.

17
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:26,271
I'm a contractor, I work with lots of different studios and companies, and these guys have

18
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:34,893
started their own companies, so their PR departments are not a little queasy about talking about

19
00:01:34,913 --> 00:01:40,775
the fact that there are some health problems with working in the game industry.

20
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:51,121
So this is why I wanted to give the talk.

21
00:01:51,422 --> 00:01:56,127
I have started teaching students about game design.

22
00:01:56,527 --> 00:02:00,752
And they're very excited about game design,

23
00:02:00,772 --> 00:02:02,514
and they're very excited about getting into this.

24
00:02:04,282 --> 00:02:11,486
subject and not worried at all about what it will do to their life. And when I try to

25
00:02:11,526 --> 00:02:15,889
talk to them about it, they say, well, you know, it might give me carpal tunnel, but

26
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:27,615
there's surgery for that now, so what's the big deal? And when I talk to all of my game

27
00:02:27,715 --> 00:02:33,438
industry dev friends, they say, ah, yes, so I'm on my fifth spinal.

28
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:45,210
surgery. There's a big disconnect between what students coming into industry think their

29
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:50,114
life is going to be in the game industry and what it actually is for people who have been

30
00:02:50,154 --> 00:02:54,398
in the industry for a long time. So I started to wonder.

31
00:02:56,154 --> 00:02:58,255
Is this just me?

32
00:02:59,436 --> 00:03:03,018
Is it just my friends who are willing to talk to me about,

33
00:03:03,038 --> 00:03:06,020
hey, you know, dump on me all of my health problems,

34
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,741
because I have my own health problems.

35
00:03:08,542 --> 00:03:12,084
And I wondered if I was getting skewed to you.

36
00:03:12,224 --> 00:03:15,006
You know, maybe it's just that people like to complain to me

37
00:03:15,066 --> 00:03:15,706
about their health.

38
00:03:16,267 --> 00:03:17,828
And maybe it's not the entire industry

39
00:03:17,868 --> 00:03:18,788
that has these problems.

40
00:03:20,309 --> 00:03:20,730
Could be.

41
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,331
I like to check things out before I.

42
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,702
go and tell everybody we've got to change what we're doing.

43
00:03:31,743 --> 00:03:33,984
But, no, this is a real thing.

44
00:03:34,905 --> 00:03:37,606
People are really dying.

45
00:03:39,167 --> 00:03:40,968
Some of us in this room have friends

46
00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:46,191
who recently have been added to the list of game developers

47
00:03:46,712 --> 00:03:47,392
who have died.

48
00:03:51,154 --> 00:03:53,995
And so it's kind of a tough topic to talk about,

49
00:03:54,035 --> 00:03:56,616
because when we're talking about it's dangerous,

50
00:03:58,577 --> 00:04:00,038
it's not just, well, maybe you'll

51
00:04:00,058 --> 00:04:03,159
have to go through one little surgery at some point in time.

52
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,041
There are real dangers in this industry

53
00:04:06,461 --> 00:04:08,342
that need to be talked about.

54
00:04:09,342 --> 00:04:12,424
So I went through to kind of analyze

55
00:04:12,564 --> 00:04:16,486
why it is that people are dying in our industry.

56
00:04:16,786 --> 00:04:18,327
And it came down to.

57
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:28,694
three things. First, neglect. They're just ignoring symptoms that they have. Not going

58
00:04:28,714 --> 00:04:36,497
to doctors. One of the people that I talked to as I was discussing this talk with them

59
00:04:38,338 --> 00:04:44,400
shared the story of their friend who was a game developer who felt fine and then went

60
00:04:46,305 --> 00:04:51,487
there was a little mole on his shoulder and six months later he was dead because

61
00:04:53,028 --> 00:04:59,370
he had cancer and cancer doesn't hurt. So he didn't go to the doctor. He felt fine.

62
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:07,413
And so if it had been caught six months sooner, he would have lived. But he felt fine. So

63
00:05:07,513 --> 00:05:11,775
he didn't have his regular checkups and things like that.

64
00:05:13,649 --> 00:05:30,535
The other thing is reckless behavior, which I include driving while sleep deprived, like when you've been crunching for three weeks straight and you haven't had enough sleep and you wake up on the freeway going 70 or you don't wake up on the freeway going 70.

65
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:38,598
And there are substance abuse problems in the industry that sometimes we admit and sometimes we don't.

66
00:05:39,578 --> 00:05:41,099
And then the third reason.

67
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:50,966
is the hardest one I think for a lot of us, but has hit home fairly recently.

68
00:05:51,326 --> 00:06:00,292
So big question is, what is going on?

69
00:06:00,312 --> 00:06:04,015
I like to do research and not just guess.

70
00:06:04,255 --> 00:06:06,536
So I have an idea.

71
00:06:09,129 --> 00:06:17,713
I am going to put together a totally unscientific, anecdotal, interesting survey to get feedback

72
00:06:18,113 --> 00:06:23,917
and stories and find out if it's not just my small circle of friends, but get it out

73
00:06:23,977 --> 00:06:28,319
to as many people as I possibly could.

74
00:06:28,339 --> 00:06:29,440
So I got...

75
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,720
There it is.

76
00:06:38,149 --> 00:06:45,094
Um, lots of responses, 420 answers from 27 countries.

77
00:06:45,794 --> 00:06:52,059
Um, and it was very enlightening.

78
00:06:53,100 --> 00:07:00,325
I came up with the questions based on, you know, things I know myself and research

79
00:07:00,345 --> 00:07:04,969
on other industries that spend a lot of time working in offices and creative

80
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:06,370
industries like, um.

81
00:07:07,502 --> 00:07:09,903
television and movies and some things like that.

82
00:07:11,204 --> 00:07:14,266
The feedback that I got really surprised me.

83
00:07:16,467 --> 00:07:18,789
Everyone kind of knew that they were not taking

84
00:07:18,929 --> 00:07:21,370
good care of themselves with their ergonomics

85
00:07:21,591 --> 00:07:25,213
and nutrition and taking breaks and getting enough exercise.

86
00:07:25,413 --> 00:07:28,495
I have some really fun graphs I tried to shove

87
00:07:28,555 --> 00:07:31,717
into this short presentation and had to take out.

88
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:36,720
But I will make available later because it's very interesting information.

89
00:07:37,261 --> 00:07:42,802
So when I talked to people though, and in the feedback that I got written in, in

90
00:07:42,842 --> 00:07:44,463
the, Hey, write anything you want.

91
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:46,604
Um, they were like, we know this stuff.

92
00:07:46,684 --> 00:07:48,404
We know we're not sitting up straight at our desks.

93
00:07:49,285 --> 00:07:54,226
Um, are you going to talk about mental health?

94
00:07:56,147 --> 00:07:58,868
Uh, and, uh, please.

95
00:08:00,168 --> 00:08:00,308
So.

96
00:08:02,354 --> 00:08:08,238
I kind of went back to that, oh right, suicide and not taking care of ourselves, neglecting

97
00:08:08,298 --> 00:08:10,360
ourselves, yeah.

98
00:08:11,561 --> 00:08:18,707
So the most depressing answer I got on the survey was this one.

99
00:08:19,828 --> 00:08:21,429
How many hugs do you get in a day?

100
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:28,175
And at first people were a little confused that I meant at work, like in the workplace.

101
00:08:28,555 --> 00:08:30,697
So I clarified pretty quickly that no, I meant at home.

102
00:08:31,367 --> 00:08:32,408
your entire day.

103
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:39,756
And if you look there, 192 people said

104
00:08:40,357 --> 00:08:43,300
they got zero or one

105
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,462
hug per day on average.

106
00:08:48,345 --> 00:08:51,929
And then the next biggest chunk is one to three.

107
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:56,153
This is, yeah, not good.

108
00:08:57,594 --> 00:09:02,795
There's been scientific research on this that hopefully I

109
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:06,716
can make it show you.

110
00:09:10,497 --> 00:09:13,058
Humans are social animals, and we're

111
00:09:13,258 --> 00:09:16,679
hardwired to hug each other, have physical contact.

112
00:09:17,699 --> 00:09:20,200
They've done some really interesting research recently

113
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:23,501
about how long to hug and how.

114
00:09:24,306 --> 00:09:37,150
much good it does and the fact that getting a really good hug at the beginning of the day can last all day and have beneficial effects on, ironically enough, your heart health, like your blood pressure and stuff.

115
00:09:38,891 --> 00:09:42,572
And holding hands helps, petting your dogs does help.

116
00:09:46,713 --> 00:09:51,895
The kind of rule of thumb is that you need four hugs a day just to survive.

117
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:58,616
8 hugs a day for emotional stability and 12 hugs for healthy growth.

118
00:09:59,437 --> 00:10:05,159
And if you remember back, we are not getting one hug a day.

119
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:06,939
Many people in the game industry.

120
00:10:10,061 --> 00:10:15,503
And this carries over into, and you know, is related to how many friends you have.

121
00:10:19,435 --> 00:10:24,456
And I'm not going to judge if you're one of these people that has 30 million best friends,

122
00:10:24,576 --> 00:10:28,817
or if you're one of these people that has, you know, one best friend and that's enough

123
00:10:28,937 --> 00:10:34,899
and you feel fulfilled and that's fine, but the scary statistics are the ones that I highlighted

124
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:41,221
that I don't have best friends and I mostly hang out with people I work with.

125
00:10:41,761 --> 00:10:45,322
Now they're not huge numbers, like most of the people there say...

126
00:10:47,437 --> 00:10:54,182
I have a few best friends and acquaintances, but it's not fantastic.

127
00:10:54,622 --> 00:11:06,732
So, um, one of the efforts that's going on right now is, um, a support network that's

128
00:11:06,772 --> 00:11:08,533
being built up for people who are, um,

129
00:11:13,563 --> 00:11:20,485
feeling a lot of anxiety and loneliness. It's called the Take This Project. It comes from

130
00:11:20,525 --> 00:11:30,766
the Zelda, you know, it's dangerous, take this. It's dangerous to go alone. So there

131
00:11:30,826 --> 00:11:37,087
are some online support networks that are springing up as people realize that this is

132
00:11:37,127 --> 00:11:38,828
a real problem in our industry.

133
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:48,680
get a little deeper into it.

134
00:11:53,182 --> 00:11:54,783
It has to do with like how much

135
00:11:56,683 --> 00:12:03,066
stress you feel. So how much of your last year did you spend feeling

136
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:09,490
stressed out? And yeah,

137
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,151
37 percent were stressed out for at least half their life

138
00:12:12,811 --> 00:12:12,871
in 2012.

139
00:12:15,155 --> 00:12:26,400
Um, some of these statistics just start to get me really sad and upset.

140
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:35,264
And, um, partly because I've had my own problems with health that

141
00:12:35,424 --> 00:12:37,205
have been tracked back to stress.

142
00:12:38,186 --> 00:12:41,847
And, um, next slide.

143
00:12:41,907 --> 00:12:42,428
Yay.

144
00:12:43,085 --> 00:12:51,333
There are some really depressing things out there about what kind of health problems stress can cause.

145
00:12:52,054 --> 00:12:56,578
And I've had doctors say this to me and, you know, these kind of show it too,

146
00:12:56,618 --> 00:12:59,461
that pretty much anything can...

147
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,521
any health problem can be tracked back to stress.

148
00:13:04,662 --> 00:13:06,883
Personally, I was having hair loss.

149
00:13:07,243 --> 00:13:11,225
That's not something that a woman my age generally thinks

150
00:13:11,305 --> 00:13:12,605
is going to be a problem in her life.

151
00:13:13,345 --> 00:13:18,207
And my doctor said, no, you're just stressed out.

152
00:13:18,447 --> 00:13:22,249
And that's what's causing your hair to fall out.

153
00:13:22,709 --> 00:13:25,190
And that's not fun.

154
00:13:27,789 --> 00:13:37,451
So, uh, yes, we have a creative industry who likes to do things at the last minute.

155
00:13:39,012 --> 00:13:43,973
Um, and kind of some people say they thrive on that.

156
00:13:44,213 --> 00:13:45,073
Oh, the deadline's coming.

157
00:13:45,774 --> 00:13:49,875
But in reality stress, like they've done studies, they can test this.

158
00:13:50,986 --> 00:13:57,452
Numerically, stress makes you less productive, it makes you less creative, it makes you less

159
00:13:57,592 --> 00:14:03,498
coherent, it makes you less rational, and it makes you less able to make great gains.

160
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:11,566
So if you're stressed out, it's actually impacting your ability to do a fantastic job at what

161
00:14:11,586 --> 00:14:12,347
it is that you love.

162
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:19,795
Let's talk about some of the ways people cope with this stress.

163
00:14:22,797 --> 00:14:24,218
Caffeine was on my list.

164
00:14:27,281 --> 00:14:28,582
19% said they need a daily fix,

165
00:14:29,022 --> 00:14:32,665
which is like, no, I need my daily fix.

166
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:37,729
And there were some funny comments written in the other section,

167
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:40,392
like, oh no, there's blood in my caffeine stream.

168
00:14:41,731 --> 00:14:50,600
And there were some scary ones, like I drink two to four liters of Diet Coke a day.

169
00:14:51,441 --> 00:14:53,684
I use other stimulants that aren't just caffeine.

170
00:14:53,924 --> 00:14:58,569
I thought that was brave of someone to write in there and admit that it's not just caffeine

171
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,491
that we use in our industry.

172
00:15:03,998 --> 00:15:08,361
Yeah, while working 16 hour days, 6 days per week, I was drinking coffee in Red Bull and

173
00:15:08,421 --> 00:15:12,704
eating Aleve Cold and Flu Medicine to get the boost from the pseudoephedrine pill.

174
00:15:12,824 --> 00:15:15,906
I put myself in the hospital with atrial fibrillation.

175
00:15:15,986 --> 00:15:19,248
That means his heart stopped working correctly.

176
00:15:19,549 --> 00:15:28,655
So, um, uh, yay, my next slide has Grumpy Cat on it.

177
00:15:30,397 --> 00:15:36,360
So yeah, the point I'm trying to make is not necessarily about caffeine.

178
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:45,065
It's about using these things long-term have long-term effects on your health.

179
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:55,451
And caffeine is not the most dangerous thing that our industry uses to get by.

180
00:15:58,845 --> 00:16:05,769
Yeah, so the next question was let's talk about alcohol.

181
00:16:06,149 --> 00:16:11,532
And if this is to be believed, 32% of the game industry

182
00:16:11,713 --> 00:16:12,473
just doesn't drink.

183
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:21,952
But it's not like this is the only survey where that happens.

184
00:16:23,793 --> 00:16:29,977
Pretty much every survey that asks people about how their drinking habits, it's underreported.

185
00:16:32,479 --> 00:16:38,522
Some people said that I get, I drink to get drunk more than once a week, and that was

186
00:16:39,323 --> 00:16:41,264
4% in the industry sample I had.

187
00:16:41,945 --> 00:16:44,786
And that makes me worry, like, I worry.

188
00:16:48,176 --> 00:16:50,297
And the rest of them all knew the right answer.

189
00:16:50,337 --> 00:16:54,597
Yes, I drink moderately and not to excess and only with friends.

190
00:16:57,238 --> 00:17:01,999
So this was the next slide, this statistic that bothered me.

191
00:17:03,819 --> 00:17:06,180
Do you have a hobby that does not involve games?

192
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,221
And I couldn't make that up. 25%.

193
00:17:11,841 --> 00:17:13,781
That is literally, like, if you do this, 25%.

194
00:17:17,134 --> 00:17:25,822
Sorry, it's another one. 25% of the game industry sample, self-selecting, that I had said no.

195
00:17:25,902 --> 00:17:33,849
They had nothing outside of games that they did on a daily basis.

196
00:17:34,029 --> 00:17:44,938
So, this goes back to what do you do to cope with stress, with life, people, emotions?

197
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:56,904
Some people are not getting far enough away from their jobs that they have even a hobby to escape from their job.

198
00:17:57,244 --> 00:18:04,988
Like, if you're always playing a game, that's part of your job as a game developer.

199
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,911
Yes, so, let's move on to the next one.

200
00:18:16,002 --> 00:18:22,443
If you woke up one morning with really heavy, painful ache in your shoulder for no reason you can think of, what would you do?

201
00:18:26,404 --> 00:18:32,445
Call in sick and play games, is that 47 right up there?

202
00:18:33,605 --> 00:18:35,766
Check in with a doctor, is 83.

203
00:18:37,226 --> 00:18:41,707
Ignore it, it'll go away, I have too much work to do, is that huge chunk.

204
00:18:44,121 --> 00:18:54,125
Answers in the other section mostly had to do with people who have had this experience

205
00:18:54,285 --> 00:18:58,106
and they're like, I'd call my masseuse right away and get an appointment, or I'd call my

206
00:18:58,146 --> 00:18:58,947
chiropractor.

207
00:18:59,007 --> 00:19:03,849
Like, they knew exactly what to do because they have this problem.

208
00:19:06,251 --> 00:19:11,875
The one that kind of scared me was Google it, and then if it worried me what Google

209
00:19:11,895 --> 00:19:21,981
said, then I'd check in with a doctor and go to work and obsess over it was scary too.

210
00:19:22,121 --> 00:19:28,985
So 68% admit that they would ignore the symptoms of what could be a heart attack.

211
00:19:33,212 --> 00:19:36,093
This terrifies me for so many reasons.

212
00:19:36,113 --> 00:19:41,635
Because pain in your shoulder is a classic symptom of a heart attack.

213
00:19:43,055 --> 00:19:45,916
But even if it's not, even if you just slept funny,

214
00:19:47,136 --> 00:19:48,737
your body and your mind work together.

215
00:19:51,138 --> 00:19:53,638
And if we are ignoring things like,

216
00:19:53,898 --> 00:19:55,259
hey, I wonder if that's a heart attack,

217
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:58,520
what else is it in our lives that we're ignoring?

218
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:58,940
We are...

219
00:20:02,098 --> 00:20:06,939
a lot of those people said that they would call in sick, but then play video games all

220
00:20:06,979 --> 00:20:13,721
day and not think about the fact that they were in pain. And that's just totally divorcing

221
00:20:13,841 --> 00:20:20,422
yourself from your mind and your body. And that's not healthy. It's not going to help

222
00:20:20,442 --> 00:20:21,242
you make great games.

223
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:33,014
If I had to identify the game industry dangers, like danger,

224
00:20:33,034 --> 00:20:33,655
danger, danger.

225
00:20:34,135 --> 00:20:36,658
So the things that people talked about

226
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:42,283
in their open-ended answers, toxic bosses, toxic colleagues,

227
00:20:43,664 --> 00:20:46,527
unrealistic deadlines, the shifting

228
00:20:46,587 --> 00:20:49,750
sands of expectations, like, oh, no, we've

229
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:52,293
got to get this over Friday or we're all going to die.

230
00:20:52,473 --> 00:20:53,334
Oh, actually, it's Monday.

231
00:20:54,483 --> 00:21:00,551
What? Um, unrealistic project plans. Yeah, we're gonna make an

232
00:21:00,611 --> 00:21:06,798
MMO in two months. Let's go. Uh, extreme pressure. Just...

233
00:21:08,026 --> 00:21:16,790
this sense that the job or the game is everything and it's really not more important than your

234
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:24,493
life, I promise. Job insecurity was a big danger because there are layoffs for

235
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:28,070
unexpected reasons all the time in our industry.

236
00:21:28,991 --> 00:21:33,012
So a lot of people are just worried that they're going to not have a job next week.

237
00:21:34,533 --> 00:21:39,514
Unconscious discrimination, women, minorities.

238
00:21:40,415 --> 00:21:44,836
There's flat out bullying, creative dangers.

239
00:21:45,457 --> 00:21:49,378
This one is just the fact that we're doing creative things

240
00:21:49,438 --> 00:21:53,900
and it's scary to have this baby that you spend two years

241
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,641
building in the safety and security

242
00:21:56,701 --> 00:21:58,882
of your own little studio and then you send it out the door

243
00:21:59,102 --> 00:22:04,644
and people get on the forums and tell you what they think.

244
00:22:06,104 --> 00:22:06,665
It can be...

245
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:12,270
hugely emotionally terrifying and hard.

246
00:22:14,051 --> 00:22:17,913
And there are toxic miscommunication loops.

247
00:22:17,954 --> 00:22:22,076
That one I put in there myself for a terrible project

248
00:22:22,116 --> 00:22:25,998
I was on that had really, every time we talked,

249
00:22:26,038 --> 00:22:27,159
it got worse and worse and worse.

250
00:22:30,681 --> 00:22:34,103
But just because these are dangers

251
00:22:34,503 --> 00:22:37,085
does not mean that nobody gets out alive.

252
00:22:38,721 --> 00:22:41,943
It just means that you need to be aware of what's going on.

253
00:22:42,163 --> 00:22:44,825
Like, if you see a sign that says, beware of falling rocks,

254
00:22:45,765 --> 00:22:47,866
doesn't mean that a rock has fallen on your head.

255
00:22:48,006 --> 00:22:49,267
It means, pay attention.

256
00:22:49,647 --> 00:22:51,509
If you know they're coming, you can avoid them.

257
00:22:52,089 --> 00:22:53,890
You can watch out for them.

258
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:59,513
So had to use a gaming analogy, of course.

259
00:22:59,573 --> 00:23:01,194
So if you're in a good questing party,

260
00:23:01,614 --> 00:23:03,356
you need to be aware of what's ahead.

261
00:23:04,595 --> 00:23:10,579
and you need to prepare, you need to know you've got your healer and your tank and your ranged weapons user and

262
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,581
you need a plan and

263
00:23:16,463 --> 00:23:16,543
I

264
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:19,124
Have written in my little speaker notes Leroy Jenkins

265
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:25,468
Because a lot of times I feel like we are as game developers

266
00:23:26,228 --> 00:23:29,710
Especially the young game developers are running into this

267
00:23:33,251 --> 00:23:38,655
uh, business, excited about it, totally unprepared, not thinking about the

268
00:23:38,675 --> 00:23:42,298
dangers at all, not paying attention to the plans and the warnings and

269
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:44,319
everything that other people say.

270
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:48,503
So they're, hey Roy Jenkins, if you don't know what I'm talking

271
00:23:48,523 --> 00:23:50,284
about, go Google it and have fun.

272
00:23:52,326 --> 00:23:52,786
Uh, okay.

273
00:23:52,826 --> 00:24:00,252
So we can't all be the tanks.

274
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:01,993
Um.

275
00:24:04,219 --> 00:24:06,001
And even if we are, we have to switch out.

276
00:24:07,242 --> 00:24:10,465
If you've ever played an MMO, multiplayer game,

277
00:24:10,505 --> 00:24:13,948
you know you can't all do the same thing at the same time.

278
00:24:14,428 --> 00:24:21,094
So balance is super important.

279
00:24:21,634 --> 00:24:26,038
And how do you know when you go?

280
00:24:28,282 --> 00:24:31,865
from, hey this is weird, I'm having a hard time,

281
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:35,568
to actually I need help.

282
00:24:38,171 --> 00:24:41,453
So, I'm kind of gonna pass this over to Lydia,

283
00:24:41,473 --> 00:24:44,176
not that she can actually see the screen.

284
00:24:50,846 --> 00:24:58,069
Lydia is, if you missed on the beginning, based here in San Francisco, psychiatrist,

285
00:25:00,569 --> 00:25:08,452
and helped me out a lot with, like, how do you figure out when you need help for your

286
00:25:08,492 --> 00:25:08,972
mental health?

287
00:25:12,405 --> 00:25:20,731
So, so, so anyway, I'm, I'm Lydia Breen and I've been practicing in the area for a little

288
00:25:20,751 --> 00:25:22,992
bit over a year, but I used to practice in Chicago for 13.

289
00:25:23,032 --> 00:25:28,436
Um, this is a little bit weird for me because I'm used to one-on-one.

290
00:25:28,696 --> 00:25:29,917
I don't give a lot of presentations.

291
00:25:29,977 --> 00:25:34,741
So as I've been listening to Wendy talk, I've been sort of wondering and contemplating.

292
00:25:35,241 --> 00:25:36,302
What are you guys all feeling?

293
00:25:36,602 --> 00:25:39,904
And you're probably not going to tell us, but, you know,

294
00:25:40,104 --> 00:25:42,046
do you relate to these ideas?

295
00:25:42,066 --> 00:25:43,927
Do you have friends that you worry about

296
00:25:43,947 --> 00:25:44,908
or you're worried about yourself?

297
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:47,530
And it may be possible that you're not going to actually

298
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:49,851
think about that today, but maybe over the next few weeks,

299
00:25:49,911 --> 00:25:52,293
these ideas will come back to you

300
00:25:52,493 --> 00:25:53,694
as you're going throughout your days.

301
00:25:54,999 --> 00:25:59,822
Um, but yeah, so Wendy approached me and said, you know, I'm giving this

302
00:25:59,862 --> 00:26:04,446
presentation, we kind of like to have an MD, um, to give some credence to

303
00:26:04,486 --> 00:26:10,009
these ideas and also to add the part about psychiatry, about mental health.

304
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:13,391
Um, how do you know if you have a problem?

305
00:26:15,411 --> 00:26:17,773
Well, people are different, everybody's different.

306
00:26:18,613 --> 00:26:21,356
One person's stress might be another person's joy,

307
00:26:21,516 --> 00:26:24,038
so it's not all that clear,

308
00:26:24,238 --> 00:26:26,720
and there's this concept of the baseline.

309
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:29,142
It's up there.

310
00:26:30,723 --> 00:26:32,845
We talk in mental health about our baselines.

311
00:26:33,365 --> 00:26:36,368
Some people never really get to a good baseline,

312
00:26:36,408 --> 00:26:37,929
but those are the chronically and mentally ill,

313
00:26:37,949 --> 00:26:39,671
and probably not anybody in this room.

314
00:26:39,711 --> 00:26:42,053
But usually you can kind of look back and remember.

315
00:26:42,782 --> 00:26:48,487
Okay, when was I last really happy? When did I last feel really relaxed? I don't know how long ago that is for you.

316
00:26:48,507 --> 00:26:54,271
It could have been last weekend. It could have been last month. It could have been a year. Those

317
00:26:55,252 --> 00:26:56,894
those benchmarks are pretty important.

318
00:26:59,276 --> 00:26:59,516
And

319
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:05,361
sure, we might have hard years, and we might have hard months, and we might not always need to see somebody.

320
00:27:05,661 --> 00:27:08,924
It's my opinion though that it's always helpful to see a therapist.

321
00:27:12,835 --> 00:27:16,277
I do psychotherapy in my practice, a lot of psychiatrists don't, I believe in it.

322
00:27:17,318 --> 00:27:21,660
There's different kinds of psychotherapy, I can get into that later too, but medication

323
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,241
can sometimes be useful as well.

324
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:35,503
Rather than putting together an exhaustive list of the DSM diagnoses,

325
00:27:36,183 --> 00:27:41,145
there's too many and I don't know for sure which ones are the most common in your industry.

326
00:27:41,185 --> 00:27:45,888
They may not be any different than any other industry where work conditions are tough.

327
00:27:46,568 --> 00:27:48,509
There's a lot of them in this area.

328
00:27:50,628 --> 00:27:53,508
So, but there are things that are obvious to me,

329
00:27:53,688 --> 00:27:57,229
probably depression and anxiety are pretty high up there,

330
00:27:57,449 --> 00:28:00,510
maybe ADHD and certainly as Wendy mentioned substance abuse

331
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:02,450
that can make all of them worse.

332
00:28:04,831 --> 00:28:06,951
So if you're having trouble sleeping,

333
00:28:07,131 --> 00:28:09,611
if you're having trouble getting yourself to eat

334
00:28:09,631 --> 00:28:11,372
because your appetite is low,

335
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:13,352
those are kind of the biggest ones

336
00:28:13,372 --> 00:28:14,732
that you wanna be thinking about.

337
00:28:14,933 --> 00:28:16,413
And time is important.

338
00:28:17,713 --> 00:28:18,833
People can sometimes feel

339
00:28:20,294 --> 00:28:25,275
unable to sleep or have appetite problems for a couple of days, that might not be a big deal.

340
00:28:25,775 --> 00:28:29,956
When things start lasting more like a couple of weeks, it is actually a big deal.

341
00:28:29,976 --> 00:28:33,157
A major depression, major depression or a major depressive episode

342
00:28:33,777 --> 00:28:38,638
actually only requires two weeks of symptoms to be clinical of significance.

343
00:28:39,298 --> 00:28:44,260
So we have problems sleeping, appetite problems, trouble concentrating.

344
00:28:46,507 --> 00:28:50,812
Getting tired way too easily, just not having enough energy to make it through the day, most days.

345
00:28:52,054 --> 00:28:57,060
Lack of interest in things that used to cause you to feel happy or give you pleasure.

346
00:28:59,483 --> 00:29:01,465
Frequent feelings of guilt or worthlessness.

347
00:29:04,565 --> 00:29:11,190
the sense of feeling sort of just slowed down or an agitated feeling and actually people can see that and you usually

348
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:15,433
slow down or sped up look to you that can be part of depression.

349
00:29:19,396 --> 00:29:19,896
Not quite.

350
00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:24,345
And generally, of course, depressed mood.

351
00:29:24,665 --> 00:29:27,086
Depressed mood most of the day, every day.

352
00:29:29,027 --> 00:29:31,848
Constant worry, irritability.

353
00:29:32,569 --> 00:29:34,129
These are kind of your anxiety symptoms.

354
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:37,011
Having muscle tension all the time or most of the time.

355
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:52,756
There are a lot of symptoms under panic attacks, but panic is actually pretty common.

356
00:29:54,239 --> 00:29:55,682
Wendy mentioned physical symptoms.

357
00:29:55,702 --> 00:29:56,964
There are physical symptoms that

358
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:02,905
can be caused by thoughts, by feelings, by mental symptoms.

359
00:30:04,847 --> 00:30:06,609
If you're waking up every morning throwing up,

360
00:30:06,689 --> 00:30:07,910
that's probably a bad sign.

361
00:30:10,012 --> 00:30:12,154
If you have panic attacks, which is

362
00:30:12,175 --> 00:30:16,259
like a very discreet and quick event of a sudden sense of fear

363
00:30:16,379 --> 00:30:19,602
that usually lasts only 10 minutes, and it's peak

364
00:30:19,662 --> 00:30:20,723
and decline.

365
00:30:21,164 --> 00:30:27,189
It has many possible symptoms like shortness of breath, palpitations, chest pain even,

366
00:30:27,709 --> 00:30:32,873
feelings of things don't feel real, fear of going crazy, fear of dying, a whole bunch

367
00:30:32,913 --> 00:30:34,575
of things that people have.

368
00:30:38,958 --> 00:30:42,721
Some people might have a repeated thought or thoughts that they can't get out of their

369
00:30:42,741 --> 00:30:46,364
head that's obsessive thoughts or behaviors that they know they can't control, they have

370
00:30:46,404 --> 00:30:47,966
to do in a certain way, like OCD.

371
00:30:50,641 --> 00:30:53,564
And then emotional lability, like crying way too easily,

372
00:30:55,305 --> 00:30:57,247
noticing your thoughts are racing, flying,

373
00:30:57,267 --> 00:30:59,589
or not actually needing sleep.

374
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:02,271
That can be the opposite of depression.

375
00:31:02,852 --> 00:31:04,813
Only needing three hours of sleep, you feel rested.

376
00:31:04,833 --> 00:31:10,598
You feel driven to do more grandiose thinking

377
00:31:11,659 --> 00:31:14,842
and increased involvement in pleasurable activities that.

378
00:31:15,632 --> 00:31:17,872
have a high potential for painful consequences.

379
00:31:19,433 --> 00:31:20,713
And then substance abuse.

380
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:24,994
We can talk about what the difference between abuse and dependence is if you like.

381
00:31:26,114 --> 00:31:29,916
Obviously if you're hearing voices or you're having visual hallucinations, that's definitely

382
00:31:30,156 --> 00:31:31,916
a sign of a psychiatric illness.

383
00:31:33,156 --> 00:31:39,998
Having paranoid feelings that people are out to get you and suicidal thoughts, big one.

384
00:31:41,379 --> 00:31:42,799
If you're having suicidal thoughts.

385
00:31:44,742 --> 00:31:48,345
at all regularly, once a week, once every few weeks.

386
00:31:48,946 --> 00:31:52,889
That's not normal and it's something that you should talk to somebody about.

387
00:31:58,553 --> 00:31:59,494
I think the next slide is...

388
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:02,055
So how to get help?

389
00:32:02,315 --> 00:32:03,435
It's actually not that simple.

390
00:32:03,495 --> 00:32:04,315
I wish it were easier.

391
00:32:05,496 --> 00:32:08,176
Most people will start with their health insurance plan

392
00:32:08,557 --> 00:32:10,297
if they aren't independently wealthy.

393
00:32:11,938 --> 00:32:12,458
You can do that.

394
00:32:12,498 --> 00:32:14,378
You can call your health insurance and say,

395
00:32:14,658 --> 00:32:17,139
I need a psychotherapist, I need a psychiatrist,

396
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,460
and they will give you a list,

397
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,920
and then you can start calling.

398
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,161
It is a process and it's unfortunate

399
00:32:23,581 --> 00:32:24,682
that while you're feeling your worst,

400
00:32:24,702 --> 00:32:26,262
you have to now start calling.

401
00:32:26,902 --> 00:32:28,763
and hope for calls back and things like that.

402
00:32:29,863 --> 00:32:34,345
There are many different ways that therapists are trained.

403
00:32:34,425 --> 00:32:35,626
So I'm a psychiatrist.

404
00:32:35,646 --> 00:32:36,646
I went to medical school.

405
00:32:36,986 --> 00:32:38,387
I did a psychiatry residency.

406
00:32:39,367 --> 00:32:40,588
But I'm also a therapist.

407
00:32:40,988 --> 00:32:42,389
I also prescribe medications.

408
00:32:42,909 --> 00:32:45,270
So those of us with the MD can prescribe medications.

409
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:46,971
Then there's the PhD.

410
00:32:47,011 --> 00:32:48,171
And then there's the social worker.

411
00:32:48,191 --> 00:32:51,612
There's a whole range of different trainings.

412
00:32:51,813 --> 00:32:53,833
They could all be good at what they

413
00:32:53,853 --> 00:32:55,394
do in terms of psychotherapy.

414
00:32:57,541 --> 00:32:59,402
There are different kinds of psychotherapy.

415
00:32:59,502 --> 00:33:01,403
You've probably heard of cognitive behavioral therapy.

416
00:33:01,443 --> 00:33:03,424
There's also psychodynamic psychotherapy.

417
00:33:03,904 --> 00:33:07,286
Both can be helpful for depression, anxiety.

418
00:33:07,706 --> 00:33:12,789
Sometimes things like OCD are really better approached with cognitive behavioral therapy.

419
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:16,912
And I think that's probably about it for me.

420
00:33:16,972 --> 00:33:17,352
Yeah.

421
00:33:17,372 --> 00:33:17,592
Okay.

422
00:33:17,812 --> 00:33:23,736
I wanted to step in with this last thought, really.

423
00:33:24,845 --> 00:33:27,010
Make sure I get it working on there.

424
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:27,592
Yes.

425
00:33:28,554 --> 00:33:30,579
So know the laws in your country and state.

426
00:33:32,666 --> 00:33:35,867
One of the questions on the survey was about,

427
00:33:36,467 --> 00:33:38,567
hey, your doctor says you need an ergonomic keyboard.

428
00:33:39,087 --> 00:33:41,467
What happens if you go and tell your boss

429
00:33:41,587 --> 00:33:43,688
that you need an ergonomic keyboard?

430
00:33:43,708 --> 00:33:51,169
And one person out of the 240 said, I get my keyboard.

431
00:33:51,509 --> 00:33:54,990
Because if I'm in a company more than 14 people employed,

432
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:59,751
it's law that I get, if I have a doctor's note,

433
00:33:59,811 --> 00:34:01,471
I get an ergonomic keyboard.

434
00:34:02,191 --> 00:34:10,293
So, there are actual laws on the books that help you to be safe at work.

435
00:34:13,294 --> 00:34:14,354
I am not a lawyer.

436
00:34:14,774 --> 00:34:15,735
That's like the...

437
00:34:16,675 --> 00:34:19,316
I need to make sure that you all know I am not an attorney.

438
00:34:19,336 --> 00:34:20,496
I am not an expert in...

439
00:34:22,074 --> 00:34:29,157
in labor law or safety at your workplace, but that doesn't mean that you can't go to

440
00:34:29,177 --> 00:34:36,600
the internet and educate yourself. It's an important topic and different in different

441
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:47,224
states and different countries, but OSHA is the place to start in the U.S.

442
00:34:48,865 --> 00:34:50,966
So yeah, it's dangerous.

443
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,201
Be careful out there. Take care of yourself.

444
00:35:00,185 --> 00:35:03,748
You need to know that you are the one that's responsible for your own health.

445
00:35:03,948 --> 00:35:08,632
Your employer isn't going to send you home when you need a vacation,

446
00:35:10,353 --> 00:35:11,894
unless you have an extremely nice boss.

447
00:35:13,335 --> 00:35:16,878
But your health is your responsibility.

448
00:35:16,998 --> 00:35:18,119
You need to take care of yourself.

449
00:35:23,711 --> 00:35:31,174
That's like my key takeaway message is learn about it, educate yourself, and take care of yourselves.

450
00:35:31,414 --> 00:35:36,856
Because it's dangerous out there, but we can do it. We can live, we can survive, we can do this.

451
00:35:37,896 --> 00:35:42,918
So that's the end of my official presentation-y bit.

452
00:35:43,958 --> 00:35:46,819
I have other people here on the panel because...

453
00:35:51,381 --> 00:35:53,923
Yeah, that's just, hey, this is who we are again.

454
00:35:58,566 --> 00:35:59,527
Real life war stories.

455
00:36:02,989 --> 00:36:08,813
Personally, I've got a mystery disease that we have not yet figured out.

456
00:36:08,973 --> 00:36:13,937
I go from doctor to doctor and it's no fun.

457
00:36:16,879 --> 00:36:18,780
We've discovered a few things.

458
00:36:20,247 --> 00:36:23,588
not all of it is, you know, job-related, but things like,

459
00:36:24,489 --> 00:36:27,610
hey, my hair is falling out, they're like, hey, stress,

460
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:31,252
ease up on the stress, and hey, look,

461
00:36:31,512 --> 00:36:33,593
the hair stops falling out, it's remarkable.

462
00:36:37,515 --> 00:36:43,098
But I don't have quite the same, like, direct...

463
00:36:45,617 --> 00:36:50,659
job related war stories that some of my panelists have, if they're willing to share.

464
00:36:50,679 --> 00:37:02,763
Uh, and we did get lots of war stories from the, uh, survey, people sharing, um,

465
00:37:05,564 --> 00:37:14,327
scary stuff. Like, uh, my boss is so terrible that I can't sleep at night.

466
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:23,491
Um, I'm, I'm drawing a blank, so you guys need to jump in and help me out here.

467
00:37:23,711 --> 00:37:27,872
Cause are there any war stories of your own you're willing to share?

468
00:37:31,193 --> 00:37:31,513
Sure.

469
00:37:31,933 --> 00:37:37,114
Um, one of the things that really struck me from the survey was how many people,

470
00:37:38,875 --> 00:37:44,596
when given the opportunity to give advice to their younger selves said.

471
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:55,406
don't crunch. That crunch was not worth it and that no game was worth their health.

472
00:37:55,426 --> 00:38:06,413
I was the QA lead and manager on a project that had an extended crunch going up to ship.

473
00:38:09,215 --> 00:38:10,336
We shipped on Friday.

474
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:17,364
On Sunday, I came down with bronchitis because my body finally said,

475
00:38:17,384 --> 00:38:23,928
oh, okay, I can relax now and I instantly got sick.

476
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:31,553
I have heard stories of everything from eczema to hypertension

477
00:38:31,953 --> 00:38:36,176
to post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from...

478
00:38:36,196 --> 00:38:38,318
From being...

479
00:38:38,698 --> 00:38:39,999
Office environment, yeah.

480
00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:40,959
Office environment.

481
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:41,200
Yeah.

482
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:49,114
Those are really very real dangers.

483
00:38:51,175 --> 00:38:58,381
My personal pet peeve in this area is chairs.

484
00:39:01,824 --> 00:39:05,367
If you're working in a small company, you're likely sitting in a really crappy chair.

485
00:39:05,387 --> 00:39:05,687
Like these ones.

486
00:39:05,707 --> 00:39:10,612
Wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww

487
00:39:12,268 --> 00:39:19,130
Um, I was working one day and realized that my arm was going numb.

488
00:39:21,631 --> 00:39:24,913
And, um, as it turned out, it was because of my chair.

489
00:39:26,613 --> 00:39:34,436
Um, and I ended up going out and spending $1,500 on a real office chair because I

490
00:39:34,476 --> 00:39:37,717
decided that feeling in my dominant hand was worth it.

491
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:47,546
One of the reasons I also started giving this talk is that I had a friend say,

492
00:39:48,006 --> 00:39:54,613
you've got students, you're talking to students, tell them if there's only one thing you can teach them,

493
00:39:54,974 --> 00:39:57,897
it's to sit up straight at their desk, have good posture.

494
00:39:58,618 --> 00:40:01,861
Because I've had five spinal surgeries for...

495
00:40:04,241 --> 00:40:06,022
Nothing I was like were you in a car accident?

496
00:40:06,342 --> 00:40:12,345
He said no, it was just from sitting slouching at a desk for 15 years 16 hours a day

497
00:40:12,365 --> 00:40:18,749
and so he's got titanium rods in his spine and

498
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:24,372
Yeah, and it's um my my experience was um

499
00:40:25,606 --> 00:40:29,349
I had what was suspected to be carpal tunnel syndrome.

500
00:40:29,629 --> 00:40:32,591
And it got to the point where, after about a year and a half

501
00:40:32,611 --> 00:40:35,433
of agonizing pain, doctors were trying

502
00:40:35,453 --> 00:40:36,854
to get me to go for surgery.

503
00:40:37,655 --> 00:40:39,836
But it got worse and worse.

504
00:40:39,896 --> 00:40:44,640
It got to the point of burning pain from tips of the fingers

505
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:47,542
all the way up the arm to mid-arm,

506
00:40:48,682 --> 00:40:51,484
sensations of freezing, sensations of electric shock.

507
00:40:54,221 --> 00:40:58,245
drugs stopped working, there was no, painkillers stopped having effect,

508
00:41:00,348 --> 00:41:05,773
and it eventually turned out, in fact this is a positive story to come out of this.

509
00:41:05,813 --> 00:41:09,617
It eventually turned out that it was all due to bad posture,

510
00:41:10,798 --> 00:41:14,802
because I used to do a lot of rowing, and I had big shoulder muscles.

511
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:16,786
So bad posture.

512
00:41:16,806 --> 00:41:19,467
In fact, as I'm sitting now to reach the microphone,

513
00:41:19,487 --> 00:41:21,528
I should be, I should be, yeah.

514
00:41:22,228 --> 00:41:23,949
But leaning forwards like this,

515
00:41:24,169 --> 00:41:26,410
the pressure on nerves in the back of the neck

516
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:29,391
was called all those nerves run down through your arms.

517
00:41:29,511 --> 00:41:33,932
And everything was purely,

518
00:41:34,772 --> 00:41:37,873
all the sensations, none of them were biological.

519
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:39,534
It was just the effect of nerves

520
00:41:39,594 --> 00:41:41,174
being pinched and squeezed.

521
00:41:42,002 --> 00:41:49,084
I found this out by accident, climbing a tree to get a frisbee down for someone and hanging

522
00:41:49,104 --> 00:41:52,325
from the tree, stretching out the arms, suddenly all the pain went away.

523
00:41:54,025 --> 00:41:59,166
So then, for the next sort of three or four months, I looked into this in more detail

524
00:41:59,286 --> 00:42:05,208
and I'd been to lots of specialists already with no results, and started doing yoga and

525
00:42:05,248 --> 00:42:10,149
tai chi and gradually the symptoms went away and got much better.

526
00:42:11,083 --> 00:42:15,829
and ended up with me doing for the last seven years,

527
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:18,693
doing Tai Chi quite seriously.

528
00:42:19,033 --> 00:42:22,938
So I'm now fitter, stronger, and a lot healthier

529
00:42:23,058 --> 00:42:24,340
than I ever was before.

530
00:42:25,582 --> 00:42:26,563
It's great for your health,

531
00:42:26,623 --> 00:42:28,866
it's great for your mental health, it's very calming.

532
00:42:30,167 --> 00:42:34,250
But I would never have bothered to get into that had it not been for this single experience.

533
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:41,474
But I think the scariest bit was the multiple doctors who were suggesting surgery for something

534
00:42:41,494 --> 00:42:43,855
that was literally not the cause of the problems.

535
00:42:44,036 --> 00:42:48,018
I actually have a picture of the surgery, but it's a little early in the morning for

536
00:42:48,038 --> 00:42:48,478
showing it.

537
00:42:48,758 --> 00:42:49,959
Yeah, it's quite brutal stuff.

538
00:42:52,691 --> 00:42:57,276
I use it for my students who say, oh, well, you can fix carpal tunnel surgery.

539
00:42:57,336 --> 00:42:59,218
I'm like, hey, you want to see what that looks like?

540
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:06,186
And then they say, oh, maybe I should work on my typing skills a little better.

541
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:12,053
Anything else, or do we want to open it up for questions?

542
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:15,441
All right.

543
00:43:16,521 --> 00:43:18,221
Sounds like we've got question time.

544
00:43:18,241 --> 00:43:20,322
I can add more, but we've got specific questions.

545
00:43:20,342 --> 00:43:23,403
Yeah, we've got a ton of, so as people are walking up,

546
00:43:23,463 --> 00:43:25,424
we're not having questions.

547
00:43:26,144 --> 00:43:27,085
Do we have any questions?

548
00:43:28,065 --> 00:43:29,765
If you could go to the mic, please.

549
00:43:30,106 --> 00:43:30,746
That would be great.

550
00:43:30,926 --> 00:43:31,686
Then everyone can hear.

551
00:43:31,706 --> 00:43:33,727
I've got a long spot here.

552
00:43:34,547 --> 00:43:36,048
I'm a student at Northeastern University.

553
00:43:36,088 --> 00:43:37,008
I'm in game design.

554
00:43:37,668 --> 00:43:39,429
And I'm currently working in a lab,

555
00:43:39,449 --> 00:43:41,750
so I understand what you're, like, a lot of.

556
00:43:42,284 --> 00:43:47,733
I don't know, I've had as extensive experience as you have in terms of like, you know, sitting

557
00:43:47,753 --> 00:43:51,800
in front of a computer, but I definitely have dead weight, you know, just hours, pound hours

558
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,583
just sitting in front of a computer.

559
00:43:53,743 --> 00:43:56,227
In my right hand, I actually had to get a magnet.

560
00:43:57,784 --> 00:44:01,885
I think magnetism helps a lot, but I still feel the pain.

561
00:44:02,366 --> 00:44:07,268
And, you know, even testing, beta testing as well, controllers, what have you,

562
00:44:07,348 --> 00:44:13,511
it is definitely when I have to do both the designing, scripting, and the beta testing.

563
00:44:13,671 --> 00:44:17,313
It can be a living hell, so, yeah.

564
00:44:17,653 --> 00:44:30,527
One of the funny stories that was put into the survey was that on the typing question, I had other, and they said, hey, for those of us who work on Connect titles, we're all getting

565
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:36,952
rotator cuff problems because we spend all day doing this in our chairs and

566
00:44:37,352 --> 00:44:42,673
things like that. So it can be anything, it's not just typing, but any repetitive

567
00:44:42,753 --> 00:44:49,435
motion that you do over and over again. One of the key things that we ran across

568
00:44:49,815 --> 00:44:55,517
is just how important it is to get up periodically and even just walking to

569
00:44:55,557 --> 00:45:00,278
the water cooler and getting yourself a glass of water has a significant effect.

570
00:45:01,649 --> 00:45:04,390
Should I show them that scary slide? I'm going to show them the scary slide.

571
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:07,671
Yeah.

572
00:45:08,271 --> 00:45:13,693
It has a significant effect on your chances even of getting cancer.

573
00:45:15,473 --> 00:45:23,156
Let's see if I can make it show up ever so beautifully as I do this from the left to the right.

574
00:45:23,508 --> 00:45:28,531
when I was researching posture, I did a lot of reading about what's the best posture,

575
00:45:28,931 --> 00:45:31,233
because all of us aren't strong enough to hold our posture correctly.

576
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:36,136
And the best recurring piece of medical advice I found was,

577
00:45:36,837 --> 00:45:39,638
whatever posture you haven't been sitting in for the last 15 minutes,

578
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:44,562
it's this thing of movement, your body is really, really bad,

579
00:45:44,662 --> 00:45:46,703
unless you have exceptionally good posture.

580
00:45:48,324 --> 00:45:49,485
And it took me...

581
00:45:50,865 --> 00:45:56,972
probably three, four years into Tai Chi before I had good enough posture to literally sit still, completely still correctly.

582
00:45:56,992 --> 00:46:00,636
I just didn't have the strength and all the muscles. But for everyone else,

583
00:46:01,397 --> 00:46:03,339
for most of us, it's a case of just keep moving.

584
00:46:05,563 --> 00:46:10,546
I have a friend who started yoga and one of the first poses that you learn in yoga is

585
00:46:10,606 --> 00:46:14,328
called the corpse pose, where you lay on the floor, literally.

586
00:46:14,729 --> 00:46:18,471
And the instructor kept coming over and saying, you're doing it wrong, you're doing it.

587
00:46:18,531 --> 00:46:20,752
She's like, how do you do corpse pose wrong?

588
00:46:21,353 --> 00:46:27,256
And he would push on her shoulders because she was so hunched this way that her shoulders

589
00:46:27,317 --> 00:46:30,639
were not touching the floor when she laid back on the floor.

590
00:46:31,579 --> 00:46:32,700
So I mean.

591
00:46:35,699 --> 00:46:36,600
Get up and move around.

592
00:46:37,481 --> 00:46:41,445
The scary slide is the yellow parts of the day,

593
00:46:41,505 --> 00:46:43,447
where you just get up and go get a drink of water.

594
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:46,991
That's considered moderate exercise, getting up

595
00:46:47,051 --> 00:46:48,612
and walking around your office.

596
00:46:50,094 --> 00:46:52,356
And any moderate exercise throughout the day.

597
00:46:53,134 --> 00:46:56,656
greatly reduces your chances of getting cancer, of all things.

598
00:46:58,277 --> 00:47:00,178
So you've got a question, so go ahead.

599
00:47:00,658 --> 00:47:01,939
It's actually not a question.

600
00:47:02,539 --> 00:47:03,820
And this is not my real voice.

601
00:47:04,521 --> 00:47:07,222
But I'm with an 80-person company,

602
00:47:07,382 --> 00:47:09,884
so we're not the super giant, but we're not small.

603
00:47:10,984 --> 00:47:12,905
The other thing, I'm the director of talent and culture,

604
00:47:12,925 --> 00:47:14,186
and I came from other tech worlds.

605
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:16,447
So I would also say there may be some learnings out there

606
00:47:16,487 --> 00:47:18,068
from the rest of the tech world, because they do it too.

607
00:47:18,389 --> 00:47:19,089
Absolutely.

608
00:47:19,509 --> 00:47:21,351
But we have an EAP.

609
00:47:21,711 --> 00:47:24,493
And so the other thing I noticed when I came on a year ago

610
00:47:24,513 --> 00:47:26,074
is most people didn't know it.

611
00:47:26,274 --> 00:47:27,915
So I feel like the EAP fairy.

612
00:47:28,035 --> 00:47:29,036
I have little flyers.

613
00:47:29,356 --> 00:47:31,177
And anytime somebody is looking stressed, I'm like, hey,

614
00:47:31,197 --> 00:47:31,918
what's going on with you?

615
00:47:31,938 --> 00:47:32,938
And then I'm like.

616
00:47:34,212 --> 00:47:35,073
Why don't you consider this?

617
00:47:35,153 --> 00:47:37,974
I mean, there are tools that are there

618
00:47:37,994 --> 00:47:39,414
that people may not know about.

619
00:47:39,594 --> 00:47:42,295
Yes, will you say the full EAP?

620
00:47:42,395 --> 00:47:44,516
I bet a bunch of people here don't even know what that is.

621
00:47:45,236 --> 00:47:48,918
It is sort of a subset of your insurance policy that's called

622
00:47:48,938 --> 00:47:50,518
the Employee Assistance Program.

623
00:47:51,499 --> 00:47:58,663
Usually there's a 24-7 hotline, so definitely in a moment of crisis, you don't have to wait

624
00:47:58,703 --> 00:48:00,905
until the next day to see if you still have a crisis.

625
00:48:01,305 --> 00:48:02,826
You can call the 24-7 hotline.

626
00:48:02,846 --> 00:48:04,327
Somebody will talk to you, and they will refer you.

627
00:48:04,407 --> 00:48:08,729
And typically there is a set number of free sessions for each EAP.

628
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:10,570
And it doesn't have to be...

629
00:48:11,531 --> 00:48:18,580
I'm depressed or suicidal, it can be I can't deal with the fact that my parents need care now or, you know, my kids got issues.

630
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:23,806
And so it's also a way to get other community resources that you don't have time to go research on your own.

631
00:48:24,201 --> 00:48:28,044
It can be a way to find that, you know, oh, I do need a therapist.

632
00:48:28,505 --> 00:48:31,587
That's how I found one of my therapists once was calling EAP.

633
00:48:31,888 --> 00:48:37,172
Right. So there's tools out there that even well-meaning employers and employees may not know about.

634
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:37,993
Yes.

635
00:48:38,073 --> 00:48:39,534
So definitely go and ask.

636
00:48:39,654 --> 00:48:44,078
And the other thing is that it becomes part of your culture.

637
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:48,161
If you're the one that wants to go walk or ride or whatever at lunchtime,

638
00:48:48,481 --> 00:48:52,303
we have a whole group of people that go every day at lunchtime

639
00:48:52,383 --> 00:48:53,464
and they run and they exercise.

640
00:48:53,484 --> 00:48:57,467
And they all do it differently, but what it is is that because there's multiples of them,

641
00:48:58,027 --> 00:49:01,029
somebody's always in the mood and that will encourage the rest of the people to go.

642
00:49:01,089 --> 00:49:08,193
So you can start shifting your culture in small ways that are not going to freak anybody out.

643
00:49:08,522 --> 00:49:14,225
Yes. Um, there were a couple of things in the survey that were like, uh, be careful

644
00:49:14,445 --> 00:49:22,630
about like, uh, companies that have the gym and the food and the everything there because

645
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:28,393
it's actually a trap. You're never going to leave because you can just sleep at your desk

646
00:49:28,733 --> 00:49:33,095
and, um, yeah, so watch out for that.

647
00:49:34,574 --> 00:49:38,535
But you can be a force for change for your colleagues

648
00:49:38,595 --> 00:49:40,216
as well, like when you start making

649
00:49:40,276 --> 00:49:41,196
a change in your own life.

650
00:49:41,216 --> 00:49:41,516
Yeah.

651
00:49:41,536 --> 00:49:44,697
We don't have a debate.

652
00:49:44,717 --> 00:49:47,277
It's just for people who decide to go off.

653
00:49:47,297 --> 00:49:47,438
Yeah.

654
00:49:47,458 --> 00:49:47,518
Yes?

655
00:49:47,598 --> 00:49:49,098
This question is for Patricia and Adam,

656
00:49:49,158 --> 00:49:51,138
and also for Lydia as well.

657
00:49:52,139 --> 00:49:55,260
I'm a faculty member teaching game development.

658
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,580
And obviously, that is a major issue

659
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:02,361
with trying to always fight that culture, but at the same time,

660
00:50:03,504 --> 00:50:09,106
there's a certain amount that the students do need to do to be able to compete to get

661
00:50:09,147 --> 00:50:09,767
into the career.

662
00:50:10,707 --> 00:50:16,350
And I do try and I have breaks every hour and I have a big section about cumulative

663
00:50:16,390 --> 00:50:20,591
trauma disorder and health disorder in my syllabus.

664
00:50:20,651 --> 00:50:25,013
But beyond just taking breaks, are there some other things the three of you could suggest

665
00:50:25,113 --> 00:50:26,774
both for the physical and the mental side?

666
00:50:27,517 --> 00:50:31,919
just little things within the classroom and that I can start to kind of integrate,

667
00:50:32,059 --> 00:50:33,639
help them integrate into their practice.

668
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:36,500
So I'm going to do a shameless plug at this point.

669
00:50:37,721 --> 00:50:40,042
As a hobby, I run a site called I Love Crunch,

670
00:50:41,062 --> 00:50:46,844
whose purpose is to just document and pull together what people are saying about crunch

671
00:50:47,144 --> 00:50:49,345
and what the evidence is and the anecdotal stories.

672
00:50:51,154 --> 00:50:56,815
And I get no benefit from this, it's no ad or anything, it's just, it's there as a service for two reasons.

673
00:50:56,955 --> 00:51:02,997
One is that a lot of teams and companies lie outrageously about their crunch behaviors.

674
00:51:04,038 --> 00:51:07,999
And what I've seen working with students is a lot of their impressions come from what they've read in the press

675
00:51:08,139 --> 00:51:11,780
and frequently what they're reading in the press is bald-faced lies.

676
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:17,862
There's an awful lot of it, it's been through multiple layers of PR people, it's been through multiple marketing people.

677
00:51:19,643 --> 00:51:26,367
And to combat that was the main reason we started this site, to document what's actually happening at these companies.

678
00:51:26,868 --> 00:51:32,171
So you can go there and you can click on any company title and any project title.

679
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:38,112
and see what's been publicly said, not just by the managers and the leads and so on,

680
00:51:38,352 --> 00:51:40,953
but the engineers, the artists, the programmers working on it.

681
00:51:42,374 --> 00:51:44,134
And I appreciate your problem.

682
00:51:44,174 --> 00:51:50,596
You're fighting a rearguard action against the overwhelming set of public statements

683
00:51:50,636 --> 00:51:53,918
by people who will go nameless, because I don't want to be sued,

684
00:51:54,118 --> 00:51:57,979
but making statements like, if you do not crunch, you're unprofessional

685
00:51:58,359 --> 00:51:59,840
and you will never work for my company.

686
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,482
which is completely outrageous and entirely wrong.

687
00:52:04,883 --> 00:52:09,005
But one of the recurring things we see on the studies

688
00:52:09,726 --> 00:52:14,509
is that pretty much everything people think they know

689
00:52:14,789 --> 00:52:16,370
about their working habits is wrong.

690
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:19,852
You cannot self-diagnose how effective you are

691
00:52:19,872 --> 00:52:21,373
and how well you're working.

692
00:52:21,753 --> 00:52:24,315
And you have to get other people to verify it.

693
00:52:26,691 --> 00:52:32,055
There was a thing we did at one team which we found worked really well, which was doing Connect 4,

694
00:52:33,116 --> 00:52:37,399
playing it online anonymously with a maximum of three seconds per turn.

695
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:43,304
And it's such a simple game, we all know how to play it, but it turns out three seconds per turn

696
00:52:43,764 --> 00:52:48,528
really checks how alert and awake you are, because you can lose in three moves

697
00:52:48,708 --> 00:52:50,689
just because your brain isn't functioning.

698
00:52:51,110 --> 00:52:55,455
and you can do this after a cup of coffee first thing in the morning when you think you're wide awake.

699
00:52:56,095 --> 00:53:02,563
And so we found doing really stupid tests like that, but really simple ones, was a massive eye-opener for all of us.

700
00:53:03,504 --> 00:53:07,208
It would even show up, did you go out and drink alcohol last night?

701
00:53:07,695 --> 00:53:11,498
It made a noticeable effect on how often you won versus lost.

702
00:53:13,079 --> 00:53:20,525
And my experience is, beyond something like that, that's very in-your-face and evidence-based, no one is convinced.

703
00:53:21,565 --> 00:53:24,007
But I'd recommend doing stuff like that, because it's also quite fun.

704
00:53:26,089 --> 00:53:32,815
And I do that too, actually. It's not the same game, but I play a game to see how alert I am.

705
00:53:33,015 --> 00:53:37,219
Because I know if I'm alert, if I'm really functional, I can win every time.

706
00:53:37,899 --> 00:53:45,045
And when I lose, I'm like, okay, time for me to stop, because I'm going to be making more mistakes that I have to fix tomorrow,

707
00:53:45,606 --> 00:53:47,127
than I'm going to make progress.

708
00:53:48,889 --> 00:53:51,190
And just one last piece of advice, get a hobby.

709
00:53:52,672 --> 00:53:55,073
A hobby that is not playing games.

710
00:53:55,553 --> 00:53:56,814
Yeah, absolutely.

711
00:53:57,394 --> 00:54:03,377
That one, that terrified me that 25% of the respondents had nothing beyond games in their

712
00:54:03,397 --> 00:54:03,557
life.

713
00:54:06,518 --> 00:54:07,759
The CAs are telling us we're done.

714
00:54:07,779 --> 00:54:09,000
Come on up and ask us the questions individually.

715
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:09,220
Thank you.

716
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:09,420
Thank you.

717
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:09,640
Thank you.

718
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:09,840
Thank you.

719
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:10,040
Thank you.

720
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:10,240
Thank you.

721
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:10,440
Thank you.

722
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:10,720
Thank you.

723
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:10,981
Thank you.

724
00:54:11,001 --> 00:54:11,181
Thank you.

725
00:54:11,201 --> 00:54:11,381
Thank you.

726
00:54:11,401 --> 00:54:11,581
Thank you.

727
00:54:11,601 --> 00:54:11,781
Thank you.
