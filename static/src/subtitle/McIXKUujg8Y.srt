1
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:08,083
Okay, I think I'm going to start.

2
00:00:10,566 --> 00:00:13,090
The first thing I'm just going to do is apologize for my voice.

3
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,872
I'm sort of losing my voice at the moment,

4
00:00:14,952 --> 00:00:20,200
so if I become really quirky or just pass out, just carry on.

5
00:00:21,567 --> 00:00:24,369
Okay, so the subject of my talk is Glitter and Doom,

6
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:27,191
production's role when making new things.

7
00:00:28,011 --> 00:00:32,014
So, making new things, it's a great thing.

8
00:00:33,355 --> 00:00:35,717
And I sometimes imagine that being a producer

9
00:00:36,337 --> 00:00:39,780
is something like being the ringmaster of a glittery circus.

10
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,103
And every day the magic can happen, and glitter can rain from the skies,

11
00:00:44,683 --> 00:00:46,364
but then equally bad things can happen,

12
00:00:46,424 --> 00:00:50,427
and everyone can feel like they have just seen someone get eaten by the lion.

13
00:00:51,915 --> 00:00:56,763
Sometimes you need to fail spectacularly before going on to making something great.

14
00:00:57,223 --> 00:01:00,789
And for me it's the glitter and doom of the process that makes everything so magical.

15
00:01:05,216 --> 00:01:08,357
So my core skill is production.

16
00:01:09,177 --> 00:01:13,378
I'm now the studio director at Media Molecule, and I was sort of strong-armed into doing

17
00:01:13,398 --> 00:01:17,219
this talk at the advisory board meeting last year, and I've been trying to think for ages

18
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:18,699
about what to talk about.

19
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:23,960
It's kind of difficult to find an angle with production, because a lot of my approach is

20
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,781
instinctual, and it's a big part of my personality.

21
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:30,964
And I don't think that anyone should actually come and replicate any of my processes,

22
00:01:31,464 --> 00:01:33,986
because our setup is unique and it's imperfect.

23
00:01:34,787 --> 00:01:38,050
But I hope to offer some ideas and insights that are going to help you,

24
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,451
or resonate with you in some way.

25
00:01:39,471 --> 00:01:42,293
So anyway, I started by thinking about producers,

26
00:01:42,313 --> 00:01:43,534
and these are all producers.

27
00:01:43,554 --> 00:01:46,416
They're actually all film and music producers.

28
00:01:47,197 --> 00:01:50,878
And I sort of started with looking for a quote.

29
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:58,499
So this one, a producer is a vehicle to get the artist's creativity on the table in a way that is accessible to an audience.

30
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,560
And this really chimed with me because it perfectly describes the role of a producer.

31
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,601
And yet the quote is from Keith Olsen, who is a music producer,

32
00:02:06,641 --> 00:02:09,582
so it's describing the relationship between a band and a record producer.

33
00:02:10,705 --> 00:02:12,606
Obviously, all forms of entertainment,

34
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:15,687
be it film, television, radio, theater, or games,

35
00:02:15,747 --> 00:02:16,507
have producers.

36
00:02:17,207 --> 00:02:19,388
But this is what they share in common with each other.

37
00:02:20,649 --> 00:02:22,890
Clearly, there are a lot of different tasks in the area

38
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,410
between the idea and the audience,

39
00:02:24,991 --> 00:02:27,492
and so the roles are different within each area.

40
00:02:27,592 --> 00:02:31,053
But essentially, we're here to collaborate with the team

41
00:02:31,593 --> 00:02:33,474
and ship that thing and get it out to an audience,

42
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:34,595
regardless of the industry.

43
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:38,997
People within games, we chase the perfect process all the time.

44
00:02:39,017 --> 00:02:42,158
And games development, for me, by its very nature,

45
00:02:42,178 --> 00:02:45,719
the process won't actually ever probably settle down,

46
00:02:45,839 --> 00:02:46,959
or it certainly won't for a while.

47
00:02:47,799 --> 00:02:49,460
And there are some aspects that we should repeat

48
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,941
and we should spend time resolving.

49
00:02:52,401 --> 00:02:54,241
But especially when you're making new things,

50
00:02:54,501 --> 00:02:56,462
you need to be able to be experimental.

51
00:02:57,963 --> 00:03:01,767
And when you're also dealing with new hardware platforms or technology, things can get really

52
00:03:01,787 --> 00:03:02,227
interesting.

53
00:03:02,788 --> 00:03:07,012
So we've got to allow for the fact that it won't always be a smooth ride, and making

54
00:03:07,072 --> 00:03:13,799
great stuff with an imperfect process is better than making terrible or mediocre things with

55
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:14,800
a really great process.

56
00:03:15,781 --> 00:03:17,603
So to bring it back to the quote.

57
00:03:18,664 --> 00:03:21,726
Rather than worrying all the time about a process when you're making something new,

58
00:03:22,267 --> 00:03:26,871
you need to sort of focus as a producer how you're actually going to help your team get that artist creativity

59
00:03:27,311 --> 00:03:29,093
onto the table and then out to an audience.

60
00:03:29,853 --> 00:03:31,415
And thinking about my job in this way,

61
00:03:31,435 --> 00:03:35,458
I realized that we kind of have like a poor language of how we talk about games production.

62
00:03:36,059 --> 00:03:42,084
So I'm going to be drawing parallels between like mainly music and making games as a way to sort of

63
00:03:42,684 --> 00:03:43,445
describe my

64
00:03:44,866 --> 00:03:45,066
self.

65
00:03:46,453 --> 00:03:49,256
Okay, this next one is another one that really chimes with me.

66
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:52,119
So, you put the cake dish over the bat phone

67
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,661
and protects you from the outside world

68
00:03:53,801 --> 00:03:55,823
and helps you actualize the sounds that are in your head.

69
00:03:56,484 --> 00:04:00,328
It's another band's production producer quote.

70
00:04:01,131 --> 00:04:03,572
So brand new ideas are really fragile.

71
00:04:03,872 --> 00:04:05,953
And it's our job to protect these ideas.

72
00:04:06,593 --> 00:04:08,553
And I've always believed massively in shelter and

73
00:04:08,593 --> 00:04:11,974
protect, but I actually really like the visual of this one a

74
00:04:11,994 --> 00:04:13,675
lot more, so I'll probably say this from now on.

75
00:04:14,815 --> 00:04:17,516
So it's protecting the idea, and the team, and the studio

76
00:04:17,556 --> 00:04:18,337
from the outside world.

77
00:04:19,782 --> 00:04:22,525
This quote represents how I like to think about my job a lot.

78
00:04:22,965 --> 00:04:25,288
It isn't referencing the kind of nightmare scenario

79
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,710
where a music producer has been hired by the record label

80
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:30,573
to impose a sound on the band against their will.

81
00:04:31,433 --> 00:04:33,996
Clearly, the quote is referencing the kind of producer

82
00:04:34,016 --> 00:04:37,880
who wants to help an artist or a band nurture their concept

83
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,221
and bring it to fruition,

84
00:04:39,882 --> 00:04:41,803
where there is mutual respect for each other

85
00:04:41,984 --> 00:04:43,405
and they have the backing and the blessing

86
00:04:43,425 --> 00:04:44,106
of their record label.

87
00:04:45,692 --> 00:04:48,133
And taking this to heart, sort of remember these guys

88
00:04:48,213 --> 00:04:50,194
and how obnoxiously brilliant they were when

89
00:04:50,214 --> 00:04:51,334
they were first on the scene.

90
00:04:51,995 --> 00:04:55,036
The Beastie Boys, I don't know who was listening to them

91
00:04:55,116 --> 00:04:57,537
right back then, but they were just so obnoxiously awful.

92
00:04:57,617 --> 00:04:58,318
But they were brilliant.

93
00:04:58,778 --> 00:04:59,798
They weren't calmed down.

94
00:04:59,878 --> 00:05:00,759
They weren't silenced.

95
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,919
They weren't told to behave.

96
00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:04,460
And their record producers pushed them to be themselves

97
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,621
and make them what they wanted to be.

98
00:05:05,661 --> 00:05:06,681
And I think it worked out OK.

99
00:05:08,226 --> 00:05:13,329
And when we talk about producers, it's me making a spreadsheet, being a producer,

100
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:16,610
there is often this desire to sort of pigeonhole which type you are.

101
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:21,193
Are you like a development manager? Are you a creative producer? Are you a producer-producer?

102
00:05:21,213 --> 00:05:24,115
And effectively people always want to split us between

103
00:05:24,155 --> 00:05:26,156
do you care about time or do you care about the product?

104
00:05:27,196 --> 00:05:32,457
And there's this real tension between creativity and delivery, and so if you work somewhere where there is that split,

105
00:05:32,497 --> 00:05:36,218
it can be really difficult to figure out where you sit or where your allegiances lie.

106
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:39,779
And I am, like, I can only really describe myself as a producer.

107
00:05:39,999 --> 00:05:43,800
I'm a games producer, and I have a wide and varied set of skills

108
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:48,981
that enable me to be able to think about what we make as a product, and I can schedule, and I can think about people.

109
00:05:49,938 --> 00:05:53,860
And it's a skilled job, not one just for people who aren't artists or audio or designers.

110
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,102
And it can be a dumping ground for people who are passionate about games,

111
00:05:58,182 --> 00:06:02,205
but don't actually have one of the other skills and oftentimes don't actually have production skills either.

112
00:06:02,225 --> 00:06:06,587
And I think probably that's the role of production differs so much everywhere

113
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:08,388
because the industry is growing so quickly.

114
00:06:09,109 --> 00:06:14,711
From the bedroom garage games to then making games with big teams and millions of, multi-millions

115
00:06:14,731 --> 00:06:16,452
of budget, it grew really fast.

116
00:06:16,572 --> 00:06:21,134
And so the role of producer came into existence before anyone had any time to work out what

117
00:06:21,154 --> 00:06:22,895
it was, and so we're still sort of figuring all that out.

118
00:06:23,495 --> 00:06:27,817
And so as production, we do have a duty to continue to evolve and iterate the role so

119
00:06:27,837 --> 00:06:29,938
that it works in the best way for our teams.

120
00:06:31,805 --> 00:06:35,006
So I'm kind of assuming that a lot of the room are producers.

121
00:06:35,367 --> 00:06:38,869
And a question that I'd sort of, focusing on us for a

122
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:41,810
moment, I'd sort of ask you why and how you got into it.

123
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:44,972
And for me, it sort of started when I was a really young girl.

124
00:06:45,012 --> 00:06:46,573
I've just always been really bossy.

125
00:06:47,153 --> 00:06:49,274
And I've always had a pretty clear idea of what I want out

126
00:06:49,334 --> 00:06:50,195
of the world.

127
00:06:51,475 --> 00:06:53,937
But it really started for me when I was between 14 and 17.

128
00:06:54,537 --> 00:06:55,698
And I was really into music.

129
00:06:55,838 --> 00:06:58,039
And I was pretty sure that it was music or film

130
00:06:58,059 --> 00:06:58,719
that I'd get into.

131
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:04,644
And I was really passionate about the Sydney music scene, and I made a fanzine, and I hung out with people that did that,

132
00:07:04,684 --> 00:07:10,468
and I worked in a record store, and after doing work experience there, and I was really driven about this.

133
00:07:10,508 --> 00:07:12,710
I was going to gigs and hanging around and all of that.

134
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:20,764
And sort of at this time when I was sort of starting to kind of get into that more and think about putting on gigs and making records with friends,

135
00:07:21,244 --> 00:07:23,825
I then got into making short films and disappeared into that world.

136
00:07:24,386 --> 00:07:28,068
But it's been when looking back now that I see how important this period was for me.

137
00:07:29,188 --> 00:07:38,094
And I was so inspired by the music that I was into and the punk and indie scene of the 80s and 90s had this real sense of everybody just wanting to get on with stuff.

138
00:07:38,794 --> 00:07:41,936
and just do things and not be waiting for anything, and it was intoxicating.

139
00:07:42,376 --> 00:07:45,038
And it's funny for me to even think that it was a form of rebellion

140
00:07:45,078 --> 00:07:46,579
when it's helped me so much in my life.

141
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,122
So, yeah, so I declined moving on to film school

142
00:07:51,142 --> 00:07:53,183
and I got a job within the web world

143
00:07:54,204 --> 00:07:55,825
because people there were really inspiring

144
00:07:55,865 --> 00:07:58,467
and they had a desire to sort of pioneer

145
00:07:58,507 --> 00:08:02,349
how people were using web technology whilst also creating beautiful things.

146
00:08:03,523 --> 00:08:06,544
And these influences of my youth preoccupied me recently

147
00:08:06,604 --> 00:08:08,745
when I was in a store watching people choose games.

148
00:08:09,445 --> 00:08:11,085
It was a really diverse group of people,

149
00:08:11,145 --> 00:08:13,086
and watching them made me ruminate on taste.

150
00:08:13,686 --> 00:08:14,886
Right there in front of me, people

151
00:08:14,906 --> 00:08:16,067
were developing their taste.

152
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,207
And they could have been picking up

153
00:08:17,627 --> 00:08:21,388
the item that may have some really big impact on them.

154
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:23,849
It could be the one that helps them play with their siblings

155
00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:26,149
in a new way, or help them with communication,

156
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:28,810
or be the one where they build their first bit of content

157
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:30,310
for a game and realize that they're

158
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:31,471
a powerful, creative being.

159
00:08:32,292 --> 00:08:35,870
And I remember these feelings when I was a teenager and coming across things that had impact.

160
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,501
I remember coming across the white girl fanzine and music movement

161
00:08:39,641 --> 00:08:42,582
and their take on modern feminism was my take.

162
00:08:43,042 --> 00:08:44,962
It had impact because they weren't bullshitting

163
00:08:45,002 --> 00:08:47,363
and they were so passionate about what they actually believed.

164
00:08:47,943 --> 00:08:51,365
And that work had impact and it inspired me.

165
00:08:51,385 --> 00:08:55,766
And all of my major influences are things that have personality and impact.

166
00:08:56,406 --> 00:09:00,208
I have a drive to work with people who have personality, uniqueness and a take

167
00:09:00,568 --> 00:09:01,948
and I'm afraid to put it together.

168
00:09:03,073 --> 00:09:05,658
Then I hope that in doing that we might make something special together.

169
00:09:05,698 --> 00:09:08,142
And I want to help them manifest that because that's what I'm good at.

170
00:09:08,683 --> 00:09:10,707
And then we can all see it and experience it together.

171
00:09:10,807 --> 00:09:12,170
And maybe it may inspire somebody.

172
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:15,636
And these are the things that drive me as a producer and make me want to continue being one.

173
00:09:16,825 --> 00:09:19,929
So when I was around eight, when I finally got to England,

174
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:24,474
I got a great job at Criterion.

175
00:09:24,614 --> 00:09:27,718
And it was really, I just got into games in a roundabout way.

176
00:09:28,078 --> 00:09:30,040
But the love affair sort of started at that same time,

177
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,783
when I realized that the people in games are actually amazing.

178
00:09:33,584 --> 00:09:35,145
I was really lucky to find the right team.

179
00:09:35,306 --> 00:09:37,588
And in your early career, and if you're in your early career,

180
00:09:37,628 --> 00:09:40,310
it's really important to find a great studio

181
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,591
and someone that you can learn from.

182
00:09:41,651 --> 00:09:43,372
And I had a great mentor in Fiona Sperry.

183
00:09:44,513 --> 00:09:46,995
And the way that she taught me, the way that I worked with her,

184
00:09:47,095 --> 00:09:48,837
sort of informs how I work now.

185
00:09:49,557 --> 00:09:53,280
Making Burnout year upon year taught us the craft of making games.

186
00:09:54,141 --> 00:09:59,724
I spent the best part of my 20s sort of hunched over a desk playing games and assigning bugs and writing lots of post-it notes.

187
00:10:01,424 --> 00:10:02,745
So I definitely know how to make a game.

188
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:06,267
And there came a point where my career, I could, big things could become more personal.

189
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:10,389
And I didn't have a, I didn't drive while I made Burnout. I didn't have a car,

190
00:10:10,469 --> 00:10:12,430
so it's a bit hard to understand it all the time.

191
00:10:14,185 --> 00:10:17,667
But I wanted to sort of play around with the skills that I'd learned at Criterion.

192
00:10:18,227 --> 00:10:23,570
So Christmas 2005 at my house, this is the invitation I found this morning, Alex and

193
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:27,052
Mark sort of told me about the plans that they had and the rest was history.

194
00:10:28,232 --> 00:10:33,575
So I started at Molecule in 2006 and since the start we've had this mission at Media

195
00:10:33,595 --> 00:10:36,616
Molecule to make innovative games within the genre we call creative gaming.

196
00:10:37,477 --> 00:10:40,359
I'm a believer in that we should make things that touch people.

197
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:44,842
A media molecule is, the mission is really personal to us

198
00:10:44,862 --> 00:10:46,963
because it's a mission that's filled with people who are makers.

199
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:51,366
I didn't come from a focus test or even figuring this out up front.

200
00:10:51,866 --> 00:10:53,567
There are individual and personal stories

201
00:10:53,587 --> 00:10:55,288
that are background to building these projects.

202
00:10:55,849 --> 00:10:58,190
Little Big Planet's game making genesis

203
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:00,972
goes back to our creative director Mark Healey's Commodore 64 days as a child.

204
00:11:03,714 --> 00:11:07,777
His bedroom hobby has led to him having a 20-year-plus successful career within games.

205
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:12,061
And from him, the idea of making a creative tool that could give people this experience

206
00:11:12,101 --> 00:11:15,884
was something that was really personal to him, and he was really passionate about it,

207
00:11:15,924 --> 00:11:18,746
and he was unwavering in his conviction that people would actually be there.

208
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:24,122
And that's sort of why we, oh no, hang on.

209
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:26,404
Yes, so many people's creativity has been sort of fed

210
00:11:26,484 --> 00:11:28,065
by things like that within the molecule,

211
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:29,206
Tony Hart or Lego.

212
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:32,568
And so their personal mission has been to share the joy

213
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,069
they got out of these things as young people

214
00:11:34,089 --> 00:11:35,430
and inspire other young people.

215
00:11:36,151 --> 00:11:38,012
And so that's sort of why we all make things, isn't it?

216
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,933
It's a way of us expressing something.

217
00:11:40,434 --> 00:11:42,175
And as makers, we've all been inspired

218
00:11:42,215 --> 00:11:43,856
and we seek out inspiration,

219
00:11:43,896 --> 00:11:47,118
which then helps us actually make more.

220
00:11:47,179 --> 00:11:49,400
And this is great cycle that we're sort of continuing.

221
00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:53,732
So we make special stuff when it comes from a personal place.

222
00:11:54,332 --> 00:11:56,874
And creating from this place may not dictate how successful

223
00:11:56,934 --> 00:11:58,996
it is, but it will certainly mean that you have a strong

224
00:11:59,036 --> 00:12:02,118
chance of creating something that is unique and has impact.

225
00:12:04,199 --> 00:12:06,681
So to arrive at these transcendental places as a

226
00:12:06,741 --> 00:12:10,304
team, which is obviously the Holy Grail, what you need is

227
00:12:10,344 --> 00:12:12,706
to gather this group of people together who are going to jam

228
00:12:12,746 --> 00:12:15,688
and collaborate really well, and who are going to get off

229
00:12:15,748 --> 00:12:18,190
on each other's ideas, and who will be inspired by each other

230
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:18,790
to be better.

231
00:12:19,651 --> 00:12:24,197
It's immensely important that there is a crossover of taste and interest and skill and respect.

232
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:27,941
When we hire people, part of the interview is sort of this fitting in bit,

233
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:31,926
and what that really means is, is there enough of a taste crossover?

234
00:12:31,946 --> 00:12:36,972
And do we have the same view of what's good, and how will they behave when the crap hits the fan?

235
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:41,081
Everybody says that hiring great people is their goal.

236
00:12:42,321 --> 00:12:45,002
And we all say that with probably the best intentions at heart,

237
00:12:45,022 --> 00:12:48,162
but then companies bloat or the wrong people are hired and are never fired.

238
00:12:49,003 --> 00:12:52,203
And the curse of the 7 out of 10 person is a problem industry-wide

239
00:12:52,344 --> 00:12:56,425
and not sort of not crap enough to fire and not good enough to elevate things.

240
00:12:58,222 --> 00:13:02,486
The primary role as a producer within this process is to hold people accountable to hiring

241
00:13:02,506 --> 00:13:03,207
the right people.

242
00:13:04,088 --> 00:13:08,012
Another way of saying it is to help people stay focused on what they need and to not

243
00:13:08,052 --> 00:13:10,714
fall prey to false economies or desperation.

244
00:13:11,495 --> 00:13:16,219
Desperation can set in, but anyone who's ever had to manage out, anybody who's a really

245
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:19,883
great person but just not the right fit or just not up to scratch, should be nodding

246
00:13:19,903 --> 00:13:20,223
their heads.

247
00:13:21,786 --> 00:13:26,107
If we're to make these things with personality, and personality is core to making new stuff,

248
00:13:26,367 --> 00:13:27,648
then people are really core to that.

249
00:13:28,488 --> 00:13:33,190
And to truly create something personal means that people are giving something of themselves.

250
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:37,771
And I'll never forget an artist telling me their dilemma of creating something bad meant

251
00:13:37,811 --> 00:13:41,732
be the beginning of the end, and creating something amazing was just the last amazing

252
00:13:41,752 --> 00:13:42,313
thing they would do.

253
00:13:43,313 --> 00:13:43,994
It broke my heart.

254
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:45,917
And even though it's a commercial enterprise,

255
00:13:45,957 --> 00:13:48,039
we're having to iterate and we're

256
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,441
having to change things all the time,

257
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:51,744
our creative people do pay us whole tax.

258
00:13:51,885 --> 00:13:52,886
We need to be aware of that.

259
00:13:53,781 --> 00:13:58,003
And being aware of this tax that they pay to contribute their ideas and ultimately finish

260
00:13:58,063 --> 00:13:59,524
a project is important for all of us.

261
00:14:00,124 --> 00:14:04,426
You've been hired partly, hopefully, because of your people skills and your ability to

262
00:14:04,466 --> 00:14:05,506
draw things out of people.

263
00:14:06,207 --> 00:14:10,649
So your ability to create and sustain good chemistry with people is paramount, and your

264
00:14:10,669 --> 00:14:14,831
ability to be sensitive to what people have to give to birth ideas is also crucial.

265
00:14:16,944 --> 00:14:20,765
When we make new things, as a producer, we need to marry together the skills we have

266
00:14:20,845 --> 00:14:23,006
with the fact that we're trying to help this group of people.

267
00:14:23,566 --> 00:14:28,208
We're collaborating together and that can create the perfect partnership of creation and delivery.

268
00:14:28,848 --> 00:14:30,789
It's definitely a push and pull relationship.

269
00:14:31,449 --> 00:14:34,371
And I've been thinking about trying to find a way of talking about

270
00:14:35,552 --> 00:14:37,414
sort of being creative without toe-stepping.

271
00:14:38,074 --> 00:14:40,536
And so I'm going to sort of talk a bit about music producers again.

272
00:14:40,696 --> 00:14:43,058
And there are many kinds of band and producer relationships,

273
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:44,699
but in this scenario,

274
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,862
in this scenario where they've chosen to work with each other

275
00:14:47,882 --> 00:14:50,564
and have some kind of mutual respect for each other's ability,

276
00:14:50,624 --> 00:14:53,206
they may have some of the same challenges that we do.

277
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:56,607
They're working with a highly creative group of people

278
00:14:56,647 --> 00:14:59,468
who have a flavor and a strong view of what they want to make,

279
00:14:59,968 --> 00:15:02,829
and their job is to help that group navigate towards what the group want to make.

280
00:15:03,489 --> 00:15:06,449
And I'm sure that the ones that I respect a lot anyway

281
00:15:06,509 --> 00:15:08,890
are judged on whether or not the record was successful,

282
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:12,751
and not just commercially and critically, but most importantly by the band.

283
00:15:13,251 --> 00:15:14,711
And that's how I want to be judged also.

284
00:15:14,731 --> 00:15:18,612
I want to be judged on the end result and how much it matches up to what the team wanted,

285
00:15:19,132 --> 00:15:21,933
and how I help them actually navigate towards that experience

286
00:15:22,053 --> 00:15:23,653
and how much they want to go through it again with me.

287
00:15:25,054 --> 00:15:26,756
And that role does require creativity.

288
00:15:26,776 --> 00:15:31,399
It requires you to know what good is and where the quality bar is set and to have an opinion

289
00:15:31,439 --> 00:15:31,880
of your own.

290
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,502
And otherwise, you're just not going to stand any chance of helping the team be able to

291
00:15:35,543 --> 00:15:35,923
reach it.

292
00:15:36,423 --> 00:15:40,146
You're often going to be the person who needs to give the team the reality checks on where

293
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:41,607
they are versus where they want to be.

294
00:15:42,388 --> 00:15:46,571
And so you need to know when it's not there yet and have thoughts and suggestions on how

295
00:15:46,611 --> 00:15:48,212
to help facilitate them getting back there.

296
00:15:49,013 --> 00:15:53,015
I don't have the solutions, but I do help pull the team towards a higher quality product

297
00:15:53,075 --> 00:15:56,497
by helping them get back on the path or know when they're off it.

298
00:15:56,917 --> 00:16:00,379
And I really want what we create to be better than what they were ever expecting.

299
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:05,502
So one of the most crucial relationships on the team is a creative lead and the main producer,

300
00:16:05,782 --> 00:16:11,085
and it's imperative that I know what the people are aiming for, and so I can help figure out

301
00:16:11,325 --> 00:16:12,166
what they need from me.

302
00:16:15,987 --> 00:16:18,808
So, Criterion, when I was working for Alex Ward and Fiona Sperry,

303
00:16:18,848 --> 00:16:20,408
my job was to sort of track delivery.

304
00:16:21,709 --> 00:16:23,930
But a large part of what I did was sort of cheerlead the team.

305
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:26,571
And over time, it was to work with Alex

306
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:28,092
to get what he was thinking out to the team

307
00:16:28,132 --> 00:16:29,192
in a way that would be useful.

308
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:34,875
So, shipping a game annually meant

309
00:16:34,915 --> 00:16:36,635
that there was always a pressing issue of time.

310
00:16:36,655 --> 00:16:37,976
Time was always a pressing issue.

311
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:39,657
And so getting everything done on time

312
00:16:39,697 --> 00:16:41,498
and ready for our kind of annual alpha panic

313
00:16:41,598 --> 00:16:42,998
was something that I sort of dealt with.

314
00:16:43,826 --> 00:16:47,190
Making sequels with the arms race of a racing genre is tough,

315
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:51,494
and so as a producer on such things, you're sort of trying to keep the team laser-focused

316
00:16:51,554 --> 00:16:54,517
on being a cut above and knowing what all the other games are doing,

317
00:16:54,557 --> 00:16:56,940
and knowing how to be different from all of those.

318
00:16:57,561 --> 00:17:01,104
And I felt responsible, probably more than necessary, to the team,

319
00:17:01,124 --> 00:17:02,706
sort of achieving 10 out of 10.

320
00:17:02,846 --> 00:17:06,850
And the process was so grueling that it just wouldn't have made it worth it otherwise.

321
00:17:07,891 --> 00:17:10,413
When I joined Media Molecule, this is us back in 2006,

322
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:13,815
looking all young and photoshopped.

323
00:17:14,556 --> 00:17:18,179
My role in the early days of LBP was to provide some structure

324
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:20,620
initially to how things work.

325
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,342
So Adam, Wildstones, managed the Sony relationship

326
00:17:23,382 --> 00:17:25,184
and ensured that all the bits hung together.

327
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:28,246
The biggest differences between there and Criterion

328
00:17:28,286 --> 00:17:30,788
were the fact that there were four creative directors.

329
00:17:30,868 --> 00:17:33,170
Mark was creative director, wasn't really cut and dry.

330
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,371
All four contribute massively to the creative direction

331
00:17:35,391 --> 00:17:35,952
of the project.

332
00:17:36,652 --> 00:17:39,175
But the guys had so many ideas and were so desperate to ship

333
00:17:39,195 --> 00:17:40,456
that we had a really great crossover.

334
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:43,298
I bought my console experience and sort of tried to get us

335
00:17:43,318 --> 00:17:44,760
to look at things as a whole project.

336
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,183
And so, you know, make sure we have, like, sort of reviewing

337
00:17:48,203 --> 00:17:49,604
and iterating and all that kind of thing.

338
00:17:50,405 --> 00:17:52,066
But they sort of really taught me looseness,

339
00:17:52,126 --> 00:17:53,788
and I sort of somehow sort of taught them

340
00:17:53,808 --> 00:17:54,729
sort of how to come together.

341
00:17:56,327 --> 00:17:59,449
My role at Media Molecule has evolved to the beat of the studio,

342
00:17:59,489 --> 00:18:01,270
where we've been through lots of phases.

343
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:04,272
Being a new startup and launching a service

344
00:18:04,332 --> 00:18:05,432
and not really having a clue,

345
00:18:05,973 --> 00:18:09,435
to being a service support through having a DLC community

346
00:18:09,495 --> 00:18:11,075
and struggling through that again.

347
00:18:11,696 --> 00:18:14,137
And doing a sequel where we actually started to know

348
00:18:14,157 --> 00:18:15,298
what we were doing a little bit more.

349
00:18:15,398 --> 00:18:16,098
And then we thought...

350
00:18:16,903 --> 00:18:19,988
What the hell, let's ditch that and do two new IPs.

351
00:18:20,789 --> 00:18:23,012
So the last seven years have been filled with lots of

352
00:18:23,052 --> 00:18:25,455
change, and we sort of moved from one team to many teams

353
00:18:25,515 --> 00:18:27,718
operating service, back to one, back to a service.

354
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:31,964
And I feel more than ever my role is to get the creativity

355
00:18:31,984 --> 00:18:33,846
onto the table and out to the audience.

356
00:18:34,807 --> 00:18:36,448
But there's just a lot more logistics these days.

357
00:18:37,108 --> 00:18:39,710
And in the Molecule tradition, the two new IPs we're doing

358
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,411
are based on the personalities and personal stories from within the studio.

359
00:18:42,431 --> 00:18:46,533
At the moment, my world is very much to do with this young man, Rex Crowell.

360
00:18:47,814 --> 00:18:50,155
And one of the big reasons to move to two projects

361
00:18:50,615 --> 00:18:53,276
was that we wanted Rex to have a project to lead creatively.

362
00:18:53,296 --> 00:18:57,158
He just thought that he'd wanted to explore a world that actually leaked into a real world

363
00:18:57,218 --> 00:18:59,019
and a real world that leaked back into it.

364
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:02,701
And anyone who knows Rex knows that he is fabulously talented and wonderful.

365
00:19:02,761 --> 00:19:03,501
And I love him dearly.

366
00:19:04,722 --> 00:19:07,806
Then we're only part way through Tearaway, so it's not time to talk about all of the

367
00:19:07,826 --> 00:19:11,510
gory details, but I think that a couple of things have been reinforced to me about making

368
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:12,772
new stuff that's probably useful.

369
00:19:14,074 --> 00:19:17,498
I'm just going to quickly show a trailer for some people who may not have seen what we're

370
00:19:17,518 --> 00:19:18,138
doing there.

371
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:21,863
I have to press the button.

372
00:19:37,206 --> 00:19:41,908
Oh, I remember this place from when I first arrived.

373
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:46,490
I wandered alone, but somehow survived.

374
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:51,392
The trees were so tall, reaching up to the sky,

375
00:19:51,492 --> 00:19:55,113
that I couldn't believe my eyes.

376
00:19:55,253 --> 00:19:59,855
Boys, I couldn't believe my eyes.

377
00:20:05,129 --> 00:20:09,373
Well, so forth I found from its noise and its stench

378
00:20:09,673 --> 00:20:13,757
To the tavern I did go, for my thirst to be quenched

379
00:20:14,217 --> 00:20:18,441
An old docker, he warned me of a terrible sight

380
00:20:18,901 --> 00:20:23,345
Oh, he couldn't believe his eyes, boys

381
00:20:23,425 --> 00:20:27,168
He couldn't believe his eyes

382
00:20:35,015 --> 00:20:37,996
When you go to Vegas, Gary, they're not hairy, they're as cakey,

383
00:20:38,056 --> 00:20:40,397
call them either that or two.

384
00:20:41,098 --> 00:20:42,318
Run away, they're after you.

385
00:21:16,834 --> 00:21:19,735
Okay, so, we've been on a bit of a journey.

386
00:21:20,615 --> 00:21:24,277
A long while earlier, the game looked a little bit like that.

387
00:21:26,537 --> 00:21:29,959
And the finger looked a little bit like this.

388
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:38,942
Because we were a little bit distracted by this.

389
00:21:42,203 --> 00:21:43,543
And we were a little bit distracted by...

390
00:21:47,864 --> 00:21:51,787
It's video that's not just a loading screen.

391
00:21:51,847 --> 00:21:53,888
We were a bit distracted by a video that's not playing.

392
00:21:54,649 --> 00:21:55,329
We just move on.

393
00:21:55,749 --> 00:21:57,210
We were a little bit distracted by things.

394
00:21:57,851 --> 00:21:59,432
Oh no, my machine's still working.

395
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:01,393
Nearly there.

396
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:03,795
I know, I know.

397
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:04,975
Oh, yes.

398
00:22:05,756 --> 00:22:08,157
OK, we're not going to do that.

399
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:11,500
But then we sort of started to get a little bit back on track

400
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,342
and we sort of started to make something a little bit more like this.

401
00:22:20,918 --> 00:22:22,581
I'm not going to stay there.

402
00:22:27,135 --> 00:22:31,138
What did Rex need from production to help us guide it from one place to another?

403
00:22:31,879 --> 00:22:37,303
Firstly, he needed for me as a producer to understand that there were prototypes that

404
00:22:37,323 --> 00:22:39,024
were important stepping stones along the way.

405
00:22:39,805 --> 00:22:44,289
And all of these are interesting to have had some sort of impact on where we are now.

406
00:22:44,969 --> 00:22:49,973
I often think of development as a spiral, and you start on the outer ring with the broad

407
00:22:50,013 --> 00:22:53,396
concepts and it becomes more honed as time goes by until you've reached the middle and

408
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:54,596
have arrived at the purest version.

409
00:22:55,883 --> 00:22:59,006
As you make something new, you all learn what's important,

410
00:22:59,446 --> 00:23:00,327
and you focus on that.

411
00:23:00,347 --> 00:23:02,268
And all of these prototypes have really helped with that.

412
00:23:03,009 --> 00:23:04,590
Throughout development, we had sort of advanced

413
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:06,112
on several fronts, but unfortunately,

414
00:23:06,132 --> 00:23:07,813
the things that were most important to Rex

415
00:23:07,873 --> 00:23:08,894
still hadn't been proven.

416
00:23:09,395 --> 00:23:10,535
And we've become sidetracked

417
00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:14,339
and focusing on sort of huge, ambitious features

418
00:23:14,379 --> 00:23:17,541
like a procedural world generation,

419
00:23:17,642 --> 00:23:20,264
which was needed to support a kind of location-based

420
00:23:20,284 --> 00:23:22,165
GPS gameplay that we were looking at.

421
00:23:22,886 --> 00:23:24,648
But we lost focus on other features,

422
00:23:24,688 --> 00:23:26,429
such as the rear touch finger, which

423
00:23:26,469 --> 00:23:28,791
was part of the original core idea for the game.

424
00:23:28,971 --> 00:23:32,534
And they were denied the love that they needed as a result.

425
00:23:32,574 --> 00:23:34,056
And so this lack of love and attention

426
00:23:34,116 --> 00:23:35,657
meant that a lot of that gameplay

427
00:23:35,717 --> 00:23:36,978
was in an unfinished state.

428
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:40,761
And it made it difficult for the team

429
00:23:40,901 --> 00:23:43,444
to get behind it, which would then

430
00:23:43,504 --> 00:23:46,926
result in them not making use of it when they were designing

431
00:23:46,947 --> 00:23:47,387
gameplay.

432
00:23:47,907 --> 00:23:50,469
So the team needed to be excited by the feature for them

433
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:51,210
to want to use it.

434
00:23:52,455 --> 00:23:55,176
And I think we as games makers, every now and then,

435
00:23:55,236 --> 00:23:56,616
can fall into the trap of thinking

436
00:23:56,656 --> 00:23:58,316
that we don't need to finish something in order

437
00:23:58,356 --> 00:24:01,237
to prove it to ourselves, to want to engage with it,

438
00:24:01,337 --> 00:24:04,077
and that we can fill in the blanks using our imaginations.

439
00:24:04,858 --> 00:24:06,838
But if you're making something new,

440
00:24:07,398 --> 00:24:08,618
then you really need to make sure

441
00:24:08,638 --> 00:24:11,519
that you focus on implementing the core aspects really,

442
00:24:11,539 --> 00:24:12,959
really well, and the things that is actually

443
00:24:12,979 --> 00:24:14,299
going to stand out and be fun.

444
00:24:14,879 --> 00:24:17,080
As it's these unique and special things in your game

445
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:20,080
that need to be implemented and iterated until proven or cut.

446
00:24:20,821 --> 00:24:22,342
As it's these, it's going to be the make and break.

447
00:24:22,482 --> 00:24:25,343
And bad implementations can make a really good idea look bad,

448
00:24:25,944 --> 00:24:29,286
and good implementations can actually mask weak ideas.

449
00:24:29,946 --> 00:24:32,027
So the crucial thing for production in a stage like this

450
00:24:32,107 --> 00:24:33,608
is to know where the creative director's head's at.

451
00:24:34,069 --> 00:24:36,390
And the reattached finger was the gateway to the godly powers,

452
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:38,952
and the fact that we hadn't pushed through and implemented this properly

453
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:41,293
meant that we weren't getting there and that we were straying away

454
00:24:41,353 --> 00:24:42,554
from the purity of the idea.

455
00:24:43,234 --> 00:24:45,315
So our role within production is to guide it back

456
00:24:45,516 --> 00:24:47,597
to where the creative leads want it to be,

457
00:24:47,677 --> 00:24:48,737
and we have to be their guardian.

458
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:55,112
It's totally natural on the outer side of the spiral to have more than you need, and that can feel really overwhelming to some people.

459
00:24:55,553 --> 00:24:59,716
But it really can't to you as a producer. You sort of have to be the person that can help guide it back.

460
00:25:00,756 --> 00:25:04,860
But to move from this outer ring down to the next level of focus, what Rex needed from

461
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,841
me was just support.

462
00:25:06,501 --> 00:25:11,045
And I needed to put that cake dish over the bat phone, as we started to get sort of feedback

463
00:25:11,085 --> 00:25:11,886
from every which way.

464
00:25:11,946 --> 00:25:14,809
And our green light was coming up, and people on the team felt that there was pressure to

465
00:25:14,849 --> 00:25:17,331
keep to certain concepts, sort of like GPS.

466
00:25:17,911 --> 00:25:22,756
And I needed to ensure that Rex and Dave from work had the chance to review everything and

467
00:25:22,776 --> 00:25:24,377
figure out the priorities and the core of the game.

468
00:25:25,098 --> 00:25:29,041
So we'd realized some things were going to be really hard to pull off, such as creating

469
00:25:29,081 --> 00:25:30,022
a whole world procedurally.

470
00:25:30,062 --> 00:25:32,925
And so it meant that we were going to have to let some people down as they were really

471
00:25:32,945 --> 00:25:34,006
into the things that they pursued.

472
00:25:34,746 --> 00:25:39,771
So the way that we dealt with this was I just sent Rex and Dave into a room to review the

473
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:40,832
various ideas.

474
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:45,035
And we agreed that they needed to come out with a revised cut of the concept, and they

475
00:25:45,055 --> 00:25:48,739
didn't need to include any of the ideas that they didn't like or agree with.

476
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:52,021
And no matter how prominent, no matter how much pressure on us there was to keep them.

477
00:25:53,363 --> 00:25:55,485
Because we are going to be the ones that are going to be there at 3 a.m.

478
00:25:55,505 --> 00:25:57,467
in the morning solving all of the millions of problems.

479
00:25:58,048 --> 00:26:03,373
And green lighting something you don't want to make has got to be worse than green lighting something that...

480
00:26:03,493 --> 00:26:04,333
Did I say that with the right one?

481
00:26:04,794 --> 00:26:08,057
Yeah, green lighting something you don't want to make is worse than not being green lit.

482
00:26:08,617 --> 00:26:10,139
I think. I mean it would be for me.

483
00:26:10,179 --> 00:26:14,143
I don't think you have the passion or the energy to be able to actually see it through to being a

484
00:26:14,163 --> 00:26:17,506
high-quality finished product if you don't actually have the desire to make it in the first place.

485
00:26:19,072 --> 00:26:21,714
So they sort of came out with a very clear view of what we wanted to do,

486
00:26:21,734 --> 00:26:23,476
the Iota delivery message,

487
00:26:23,496 --> 00:26:25,838
the fantasy, sort of continuing the building,

488
00:26:25,858 --> 00:26:27,299
the fantasy in a paper craft world,

489
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:30,482
and the world being a world that you hold in your sort of god-like hands.

490
00:26:31,142 --> 00:26:33,044
We lost the GPS, we lost the real world,

491
00:26:33,084 --> 00:26:36,627
we lost the paper Zelda comparisons, everyone could understand it,

492
00:26:36,647 --> 00:26:38,209
we were all really happy with what we had dropped,

493
00:26:38,649 --> 00:26:40,991
and we'd just got a brilliant new graphics programmer,

494
00:26:41,011 --> 00:26:43,653
so the paperiness of the world was starting to feel so much better anyway.

495
00:26:44,174 --> 00:26:45,035
So it was sort of really good.

496
00:26:46,035 --> 00:26:49,356
And teams like nothing more than a clear creative direction.

497
00:26:49,396 --> 00:26:50,757
And so with everybody really buzzing,

498
00:26:51,237 --> 00:26:53,238
we decided to sort of stop everything for a while

499
00:26:53,258 --> 00:26:55,279
and focus on the area that needed immediate improving.

500
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,401
And that was the godlike powers.

501
00:26:57,701 --> 00:27:00,502
So we had the whole team focus on that for a week.

502
00:27:00,982 --> 00:27:03,003
And then that sort of turned into four in a kind of game

503
00:27:03,023 --> 00:27:03,984
jammy sort of way.

504
00:27:05,325 --> 00:27:07,746
And this sort of movement that could rapidly

505
00:27:07,786 --> 00:27:08,866
prototype some things.

506
00:27:08,906 --> 00:27:11,748
And I'm just going to show you just one

507
00:27:11,768 --> 00:27:12,628
of the videos from that.

508
00:27:13,153 --> 00:27:15,694
We do a thing where we record all of our...

509
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:18,195
Basically, this is a megaphone.

510
00:27:19,135 --> 00:27:20,176
You can run around...

511
00:27:21,756 --> 00:27:24,017
Aaah!

512
00:27:25,118 --> 00:27:25,958
Aaah!

513
00:27:26,038 --> 00:27:27,359
Aaah!

514
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,400
This is like the beginning of the drum.

515
00:27:31,312 --> 00:27:39,796
And these are like, after like a couple of days of just implementing stuff and just trying out and giving everybody the free reign to just use all of the Vita inputs they could to just sort of have a laugh with.

516
00:27:39,856 --> 00:27:42,458
And they've all kind of ended up being things that we've used.

517
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:45,179
And that's what ended up with this one.

518
00:27:45,199 --> 00:27:48,361
That all of the process we ended with.

519
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:06,657
Sad music

520
00:28:06,697 --> 00:28:07,917
Sad music

521
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:08,837
Sad music

522
00:28:09,737 --> 00:28:12,618
Sad music

523
00:28:12,878 --> 00:28:14,819
Sad music

524
00:28:15,259 --> 00:28:17,340
Sad music

525
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,440
Sad music

526
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,840
Sad music

527
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:20,881
Sad music

528
00:28:20,981 --> 00:28:21,981
Sad music

529
00:28:22,101 --> 00:28:23,121
Sad music

530
00:28:23,141 --> 00:28:23,961
Sad music

531
00:28:23,981 --> 00:28:24,862
Sad music

532
00:28:24,922 --> 00:28:26,482
Sad music

533
00:28:26,662 --> 00:28:28,603
Sad music

534
00:28:28,663 --> 00:28:29,663
Sad music

535
00:28:29,743 --> 00:28:30,823
Sad music

536
00:28:30,843 --> 00:28:31,984
Sad music

537
00:28:36,002 --> 00:28:41,348
Please be aware the Warner Bros. exhibit is closed.

538
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:22,346
If you have any questions or comments, please post them in the comments section below.

539
00:29:31,665 --> 00:29:41,189
I had no idea that was even possible.

540
00:29:58,659 --> 00:30:01,123
So most of those things did come out of the game design.

541
00:30:01,143 --> 00:30:03,347
So I am a big fan of Alice in Wonderland,

542
00:30:03,407 --> 00:30:05,892
and I really like the metaphor of falling down rabbit holes,

543
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,436
mainly because I don't think that this is actually

544
00:30:08,456 --> 00:30:10,560
a really negative thing or really avoidable

545
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,622
when you're making new things.

546
00:30:12,689 --> 00:30:16,211
And it can actually lead to some good adventures and also can lead to some dead ends,

547
00:30:16,351 --> 00:30:19,213
but it's almost, you always have to end up going through this.

548
00:30:19,833 --> 00:30:22,955
So the beginning is when you have the time to be able to truly play around,

549
00:30:23,136 --> 00:30:25,177
and so you can't panic when things don't work out.

550
00:30:25,997 --> 00:30:28,239
The more rapid and cheaply you do it, obviously the better,

551
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,842
but sometimes it really is the grand failure that leads to something magnificent.

552
00:30:32,882 --> 00:30:34,643
You have to sort of look for those opportunities.

553
00:30:35,204 --> 00:30:37,285
And if you really do not end up knowing what to do,

554
00:30:37,305 --> 00:30:38,666
you need to sort of course correct.

555
00:30:38,686 --> 00:30:41,048
And I suggest course correcting to the wild side.

556
00:30:41,629 --> 00:30:43,851
You need to be rock and roll, and you need to be courageous.

557
00:30:44,351 --> 00:30:46,653
Your team's wildest ideas might just be their best.

558
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:50,591
And it's at moments like this where the team will need your courage as a producer,

559
00:30:51,852 --> 00:30:52,973
and they will need their courage,

560
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:56,595
the same rock and roll attitude that causes a band to get up on stage

561
00:30:56,655 --> 00:30:59,117
and confidently present themselves and their message to the world.

562
00:30:59,798 --> 00:31:02,760
Production's role at this stage is to facilitate this sort of course correction.

563
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,643
When a project is lost, your creative directors are the bright shining lights,

564
00:31:07,243 --> 00:31:08,264
your first port of call.

565
00:31:08,444 --> 00:31:09,285
And when they are lost,

566
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:12,047
you just need to really help them trace back to the beginning.

567
00:31:12,607 --> 00:31:14,349
Why have they made this project in the first place?

568
00:31:14,469 --> 00:31:15,810
And help them build it back up from there.

569
00:31:16,699 --> 00:31:19,880
People will rely on you to find ways to start conversations

570
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,721
and to talk actually about what's happening

571
00:31:22,121 --> 00:31:24,502
and what people think needs to happen to improve the situation.

572
00:31:24,982 --> 00:31:26,583
You need to help people be able to zoom out

573
00:31:26,623 --> 00:31:27,884
and look at the big picture of things.

574
00:31:28,764 --> 00:31:30,945
A truly great producer can draw a team together

575
00:31:31,085 --> 00:31:32,686
when they need to,

576
00:31:32,806 --> 00:31:34,706
and leaves them to it when they need to.

577
00:31:35,127 --> 00:31:36,827
They can raise it to DEF CON level,

578
00:31:36,887 --> 00:31:37,948
all-out nuclear panic,

579
00:31:38,348 --> 00:31:39,869
three weeks before anyone has noticed,

580
00:31:39,909 --> 00:31:40,689
including the publisher.

581
00:31:42,032 --> 00:31:46,395
My point there is that a great producer takes a team to levels it could never have reached otherwise,

582
00:31:46,735 --> 00:31:52,479
and isn't afraid to make the hard decisions. It's an immensely creative and instinctive process as well as being very hard work.

583
00:31:53,619 --> 00:31:55,821
So you need to ask yourselves of your team,

584
00:31:55,861 --> 00:32:02,064
do they trust you to know exactly what risks to take and which ones to leave on the table or vice versa?

585
00:32:02,765 --> 00:32:06,467
And do they trust you to be able to see the big picture when they can't?

586
00:32:09,312 --> 00:32:13,775
So what was really needed to sort of turn Tearaway into a project firing on all cylinders

587
00:32:13,795 --> 00:32:18,099
was getting the team to work really well together and then to sort of continue moving on with

588
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:18,639
momentum.

589
00:32:18,699 --> 00:32:22,522
And so there was this moment many years ago when I was working on Burnout Revenge, which

590
00:32:22,562 --> 00:32:26,665
was sort of a particularly grueling project, where I stood on a table at our local pub

591
00:32:26,725 --> 00:32:30,527
and I mapped out our path to finaling using Lord of the Rings and Sauron and our quest

592
00:32:30,547 --> 00:32:32,369
to get to Mount Doom is my metaphor.

593
00:32:33,129 --> 00:32:35,211
It was very memorable because I was very passionate

594
00:32:35,751 --> 00:32:37,372
and we were very bonded in our challenge.

595
00:32:37,492 --> 00:32:40,674
And I'm reminded by one of my workmates all the time.

596
00:32:41,094 --> 00:32:43,436
And it makes me smile because I really recall the emotion

597
00:32:43,476 --> 00:32:45,017
that I felt about getting to the end.

598
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:48,479
And as a producer, you sort of have to be that sort of crazy one

599
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,921
who's ready to, who's leading the charge to the end

600
00:32:50,961 --> 00:32:52,622
with such vigor that you're unstoppable.

601
00:32:53,363 --> 00:32:55,744
And if you don't set that beat, then somebody else might,

602
00:32:55,924 --> 00:32:57,966
but chances are they won't because they've probably got

603
00:32:57,986 --> 00:32:59,927
a whole lot of other things on their mind and it's your job.

604
00:33:01,603 --> 00:33:04,204
We all sort of know that moment of reaching the end

605
00:33:04,864 --> 00:33:09,566
where you've actually created the amazing thing that you're proud of and has the personality that you've really worked hard for

606
00:33:09,586 --> 00:33:15,569
and is ready to be shared with the world and it's an incredible feeling and the team really rely on us being the ones to help them get there.

607
00:33:16,269 --> 00:33:20,554
So at the start, my focus is very much trying to figure out what's going on in our creative

608
00:33:20,574 --> 00:33:26,662
lead's heads and help the fragile thoughts knit together into something more.

609
00:33:26,742 --> 00:33:30,587
And then there's this moment which I've labelled as the eclipse, which is basically the moment

610
00:33:30,627 --> 00:33:35,312
where the idea is no longer fragile and it's known enough by the team for it to lead the

611
00:33:35,352 --> 00:33:35,553
team.

612
00:33:36,394 --> 00:33:39,857
And then once that sort of moment has happened, I sort of turn a bit more into a fan

613
00:33:39,877 --> 00:33:45,762
and sort of reviewing it as a finished thing and making sure we always have something amazing.

614
00:33:46,222 --> 00:33:48,504
The equivalent of sort of redoing every sort of take.

615
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:52,408
And anyone who's been through filing with me will know that we spend a lot of time

616
00:33:52,428 --> 00:33:55,691
sort of reviewing and perfecting and challenging ourselves to make sure that we're finishing.

617
00:33:56,719 --> 00:34:00,361
So some of the most important work I do day to day is a simple act of just making sure

618
00:34:00,401 --> 00:34:01,142
that things happen.

619
00:34:01,642 --> 00:34:05,024
When I know the areas aren't consistent or up to scratch, I just organise reviews or

620
00:34:05,064 --> 00:34:07,206
I make people speak together when I know that they need to.

621
00:34:07,226 --> 00:34:11,308
I hold people accountable and I have really high expectations and people know that.

622
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:15,591
I don't really care about being bad cop because my focus is to make sure that all of that

623
00:34:15,611 --> 00:34:19,714
sole tax that people are paying and this initial pain that we've gone through actually manifests

624
00:34:19,754 --> 00:34:20,835
into something that we're proud of.

625
00:34:21,623 --> 00:34:25,026
And we as producers, we really fail if the game doesn't live up to that potential.

626
00:34:25,547 --> 00:34:29,911
And no amount of post-mortems or even sort of fairly okay scores will change that,

627
00:34:29,931 --> 00:34:31,133
because once it's done, it's done.

628
00:34:33,876 --> 00:34:40,923
Okay, right, sorry, my slide seems to have stopped moving.

629
00:34:41,223 --> 00:34:43,145
So, five rules to make it happen.

630
00:34:44,307 --> 00:34:46,928
You've got to know the vision and know what the big picture is

631
00:34:46,948 --> 00:34:49,688
and sort of understand not just like what it is in writing,

632
00:34:49,768 --> 00:34:52,269
but actually why they want to make it in the first place.

633
00:34:52,349 --> 00:34:54,809
It's always really important to sort of have some idea

634
00:34:54,849 --> 00:34:56,469
of personally why it's important to them.

635
00:34:57,490 --> 00:35:00,110
And it sort of can't be your big picture or your vision.

636
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:01,550
It has to be your creative leads.

637
00:35:02,671 --> 00:35:03,891
You need to know what is happening.

638
00:35:04,071 --> 00:35:06,311
And that means you need to sort of speak to people honestly

639
00:35:06,431 --> 00:35:08,312
and be speaking to them all the time on the team

640
00:35:08,332 --> 00:35:10,152
and kind of really having a gauge of what's going on.

641
00:35:11,299 --> 00:35:14,840
A simple exercise for you to do if you need one is, and I'm sure everyone already does this,

642
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:18,562
but just something that I find really useful and do all the time is just write down everybody's names

643
00:35:19,162 --> 00:35:23,843
and then just ponder on them and think about them, what they're doing, what they need,

644
00:35:23,984 --> 00:35:27,045
what I feel like I need to communicate to them, or I think they need to communicate to me.

645
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:30,151
And then workflow is obviously really important.

646
00:35:30,191 --> 00:35:31,432
It's kind of the unglamorous thing.

647
00:35:31,513 --> 00:35:34,256
But basically, do you actually know how hard it is to commit

648
00:35:34,276 --> 00:35:35,137
something into the game?

649
00:35:35,197 --> 00:35:36,138
Is it really difficult?

650
00:35:36,178 --> 00:35:39,062
Like, how much faff is there in between having a thought and

651
00:35:39,102 --> 00:35:40,303
actually it appearing on screen?

652
00:35:40,363 --> 00:35:41,545
It's really important that we put effort

653
00:35:41,585 --> 00:35:42,326
into making that good.

654
00:35:43,967 --> 00:35:44,527
Play the game.

655
00:35:44,787 --> 00:35:47,889
You need to be playing the game like an editor would read

656
00:35:47,909 --> 00:35:50,010
a book draft, or a music producer would listen to a

657
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:52,051
song, or a film crew would watch rushes.

658
00:35:52,912 --> 00:35:54,933
And it's the only way to actually know if things are

659
00:35:54,973 --> 00:35:57,875
coming together, and particularly when we're making

660
00:35:57,915 --> 00:36:00,276
something new, because it's forming right in front of you.

661
00:36:00,356 --> 00:36:02,998
And sometimes things that you think are important aren't

662
00:36:03,018 --> 00:36:05,159
things that you felt would stand out.

663
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,681
And it's the only way for you to be able to really tell

664
00:36:07,721 --> 00:36:11,443
whether or not, how important it is to organize a review to

665
00:36:11,463 --> 00:36:12,344
get something signed off.

666
00:36:13,553 --> 00:36:19,614
And if we can't get it to feel good now, then I ask you to think about what you're imagining is actually going to be done in the

667
00:36:19,654 --> 00:36:23,475
finaling phase to make it good and just get that done now instead.

668
00:36:24,615 --> 00:36:30,537
It's your job to sort of make that happen and people rely on that to happen, otherwise you can end up with that soup.

669
00:36:30,577 --> 00:36:31,697
Make sure you're team player too.

670
00:36:31,737 --> 00:36:35,678
That's the other obviously a really important thing and make sure people are thinking about what the end product needs to be.

671
00:36:37,158 --> 00:36:40,160
Because when you're finaling, you won't suddenly be able to rewrite lots of things.

672
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,602
And once the game is shipped, you can't really change things.

673
00:36:42,622 --> 00:36:47,204
So this means everything that you do every day has got to be working towards that goal.

674
00:36:47,725 --> 00:36:49,286
And the only way to judge it is by playing the game.

675
00:36:51,767 --> 00:36:54,669
Yes, so don't wait. Oh, no, this picture's gone.

676
00:36:54,729 --> 00:36:56,590
There was a picture there, but it's gone. It doesn't matter.

677
00:36:57,974 --> 00:37:02,539
So find a way to plan that works for your team.

678
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,982
And for us, we have a mentality of jamming.

679
00:37:05,503 --> 00:37:06,885
And I don't mean like game jams.

680
00:37:06,925 --> 00:37:09,027
I just mean a way of collaboration and working together.

681
00:37:09,508 --> 00:37:11,811
It's more like the idea of a band riffing together

682
00:37:11,831 --> 00:37:14,795
than just focused game jams.

683
00:37:15,604 --> 00:37:18,946
And this sort of makes me think about the Rolling Stones, and they formed in 1962.

684
00:37:19,526 --> 00:37:23,348
And whilst most of the band has changed, and their producers certainly have,

685
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:27,390
despite some gaps they've stuck together, and sort of 50 years later this group

686
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:30,692
sort of is bound together by music, and they've survived large,

687
00:37:30,972 --> 00:37:32,593
like very large amounts of dysfunction.

688
00:37:33,494 --> 00:37:37,155
I suspect that that's due to a large amount of respect for each other,

689
00:37:37,596 --> 00:37:40,117
and knowing that they're better off together than apart,

690
00:37:40,157 --> 00:37:42,578
and also the commercial success that they've experienced, obviously.

691
00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:46,120
The early chemistry was there between them very early on,

692
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,941
and enough to get them together in the first place.

693
00:37:48,401 --> 00:37:50,763
But it did take mammoth amounts of practicing

694
00:37:50,823 --> 00:37:52,364
and being thrown together to get this bond.

695
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:56,106
So unlike many forms of entertainment, games teams do.

696
00:37:56,186 --> 00:37:58,267
Largely, we do stay together for a long time.

697
00:37:58,887 --> 00:38:00,548
And at MMM Media Molecule, we don't...

698
00:38:01,788 --> 00:38:06,112
We gather a team together per project and then disperse at the end.

699
00:38:06,152 --> 00:38:11,598
We sort of stay together, and seven years in, the more we know each other, the more interesting it is to work with each other.

700
00:38:14,701 --> 00:38:18,365
So, yeah, so this analogy of jamming as our production methodology is something that we have...

701
00:38:20,988 --> 00:38:23,429
I actually have this post-it note stuck to my monitor,

702
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:26,770
and I look at it kind of every day to sort of remind me, like,

703
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:30,951
you know, when I look around the studio and I see that everybody is collaborating and jamming

704
00:38:30,991 --> 00:38:33,011
and the games are evidently progressing, then I'm happy.

705
00:38:33,632 --> 00:38:36,352
And sometimes you can just sort of feel that it's sort of broken down

706
00:38:36,392 --> 00:38:38,873
and the games aren't moving on, and that makes me unhappy.

707
00:38:39,153 --> 00:38:40,614
And I kind of want to figure out how to fix it.

708
00:38:40,674 --> 00:38:44,475
And so as soon as kind of everybody is jamming again and sort of collaborating again

709
00:38:44,535 --> 00:38:45,895
and sort of moving towards that goal again,

710
00:38:46,455 --> 00:38:48,396
they can get to that special creative place with each other

711
00:38:48,436 --> 00:38:50,297
and build respect for each other and become a close-knit team.

712
00:38:51,907 --> 00:38:57,770
But I often witness people getting worried or worrying unnecessarily about tensions.

713
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:01,012
This is Mark and Kareem, if anyone doesn't recognise them.

714
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:05,835
As producers, our nurturing side can often mean that we want to be able to protect people

715
00:39:05,875 --> 00:39:07,256
from experiencing creative pain.

716
00:39:08,316 --> 00:39:12,439
But sometimes it is kind of inevitable, and we need to make sure that there isn't a personal

717
00:39:12,459 --> 00:39:16,181
attack between people, and that people are supported.

718
00:39:16,221 --> 00:39:19,062
But the flip side of chemistry can be to have a certain amount of tension.

719
00:39:20,449 --> 00:39:22,870
So every day isn't going to be bliss or harmonious working,

720
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:25,070
but the key is obviously to make sure that your team are respectful

721
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:27,731
and people need to acknowledge if things go over the mark.

722
00:39:28,592 --> 00:39:32,633
Some of the world's most incredible partnerships have been fed by healthy doses of creative tension.

723
00:39:33,294 --> 00:39:36,055
And so it's important we don't just sort of always try to put out those fires

724
00:39:36,135 --> 00:39:38,235
and try and make everything okay all the time,

725
00:39:38,275 --> 00:39:41,357
because sometimes you just need to have a bit of that.

726
00:39:41,417 --> 00:39:44,658
So 25 sort of left-right brain people getting together to experiment

727
00:39:45,218 --> 00:39:48,219
and arrive at a commercial product that they're all proud of and have come up from scratch.

728
00:39:48,339 --> 00:39:49,340
It's like what could go wrong?

729
00:39:50,537 --> 00:39:54,764
So I like to embrace the chaos that Innova creates, and it's a big contributor to the

730
00:39:54,804 --> 00:39:57,129
feelings of glitter and doom that I sort of like.

731
00:39:58,995 --> 00:40:04,536
So communication is just as important externally as it is internally. I'm making a little bit planet now on tear away both

732
00:40:05,856 --> 00:40:09,557
Of our role was to continuously educate people on what we're doing

733
00:40:09,617 --> 00:40:14,378
And so they have the best information like when you're making a new project like you've moving at such a rate of knots

734
00:40:14,998 --> 00:40:20,099
That it's very difficult for people external to sort of keep up with you and to kind of then stay with you when you're talking

735
00:40:20,139 --> 00:40:21,900
about marketing plans and PR plans

736
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:28,061
And it's sort of important and so we've sort of started which means sort of all these fairly lo-fi things

737
00:40:29,949 --> 00:40:31,931
This one has got kind of weird sound.

738
00:40:31,951 --> 00:40:35,456
But we've just started making these very lo-fi videos

739
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:37,418
where we just talk through our milestones

740
00:40:37,478 --> 00:40:38,299
and send them over.

741
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:43,206
And we're finding that that works really well for us.

742
00:40:44,447 --> 00:40:46,410
Oops.

743
00:40:48,407 --> 00:40:52,511
So the other part of that is to making sure that you protect

744
00:40:52,531 --> 00:40:54,593
your team from having to worry about things that they don't

745
00:40:54,613 --> 00:40:55,313
need to worry about.

746
00:40:55,814 --> 00:40:59,997
And sometimes there are people who have conversations which

747
00:41:00,477 --> 00:41:02,339
might force people into thinking that we need to

748
00:41:02,379 --> 00:41:03,360
pander to an audience.

749
00:41:04,181 --> 00:41:09,105
And if you're like us, with a lot of the team, there's parts

750
00:41:09,125 --> 00:41:10,966
of the business that they need to be exposed to and parts

751
00:41:10,986 --> 00:41:11,467
that they don't.

752
00:41:12,393 --> 00:41:17,014
And so, you know, sometimes people make us a bit afraid of our audiences,

753
00:41:17,054 --> 00:41:18,495
but I don't really think that we should be.

754
00:41:18,795 --> 00:41:21,176
When you're making something new, you sort of just have to focus

755
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:25,277
on sort of being able to kind of get that thing out.

756
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:27,418
And it can be tempting at the last moments of a project

757
00:41:27,878 --> 00:41:31,039
to want to finish it so much that you lose your mouse.

758
00:41:31,379 --> 00:41:31,640
Sorry.

759
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:38,682
It can be tempting at the last moment of a project to want to finish so much that you can renege on really important things or get scared of how far you're taking it.

760
00:41:39,303 --> 00:41:45,265
And to think perhaps that you've all gone mad, but it's in these cases that you maybe just have a few trusted sources that can play the game for you.

761
00:41:45,925 --> 00:41:51,106
But there are always going to be people taking risks and there are always going to be people thinking about specific audiences.

762
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:53,888
But it's those that do take risks, I think,

763
00:41:54,128 --> 00:41:55,549
at the projects and make an impression.

764
00:41:55,589 --> 00:41:58,490
And so to keep sort of the whole circle of creative life going,

765
00:41:58,510 --> 00:41:59,271
we all have to do that.

766
00:41:59,771 --> 00:42:01,812
And so as a production, we have to be the guardian

767
00:42:01,832 --> 00:42:03,213
of this battle, sort of to keep the faith.

768
00:42:03,933 --> 00:42:05,534
And we always have to back talented people,

769
00:42:05,574 --> 00:42:07,295
and we have to let their personalities shine

770
00:42:07,315 --> 00:42:07,976
through in their work.

771
00:42:08,396 --> 00:42:10,037
And we should back them when they need our support,

772
00:42:10,077 --> 00:42:11,878
and then we need to make sure that the team collaborates.

773
00:42:11,898 --> 00:42:13,219
And at any time people lose faith,

774
00:42:13,699 --> 00:42:15,720
we need to cheerlead them and avoid the compromises

775
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:16,440
in the last minute.

776
00:42:17,061 --> 00:42:18,542
We sort of just need to make great stuff,

777
00:42:18,602 --> 00:42:19,522
and then the rest will follow.

778
00:42:23,023 --> 00:42:26,205
So some of you in the room probably won't be working for publishers anymore, and some

779
00:42:26,245 --> 00:42:26,705
of you will.

780
00:42:26,745 --> 00:42:30,147
And the way that I've always worked with publishers is a fair amount of transparency,

781
00:42:30,187 --> 00:42:33,689
and there's never been a point in pretending that you're somewhere that you're not,

782
00:42:33,729 --> 00:42:35,371
as they can largely see through that anyway.

783
00:42:36,151 --> 00:42:38,813
The thing that they're most interested in always is sort of what your plan is.

784
00:42:39,273 --> 00:42:42,735
And if you're in a crisis, it's always sort of good to be honest, as long as, you know,

785
00:42:43,296 --> 00:42:44,396
they will have seen that before.

786
00:42:46,057 --> 00:42:48,879
The thing that they're just going to be wanting to know is that you know what you're actually

787
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:50,961
doing about it and how you're sort of going to get back on course.

788
00:42:51,561 --> 00:42:53,462
We've been incredibly lucky working with Sony.

789
00:42:53,602 --> 00:42:56,783
We were small and they've sort of never really interfered with what we do creatively.

790
00:42:57,443 --> 00:43:01,004
And thankfully for us, that's sort of set a precedent for how we've worked with them the whole way along.

791
00:43:01,544 --> 00:43:04,505
We have a really strong relationship with all of the producers that we work with there

792
00:43:04,525 --> 00:43:07,306
and there's a mutual respect, even if we don't agree all the time.

793
00:43:08,126 --> 00:43:11,227
And as a producer, it may be your role to sustain these relationships.

794
00:43:11,287 --> 00:43:15,808
And you need to know when you need to use the cake dish and put it over the phone.

795
00:43:15,868 --> 00:43:19,529
And you need to know when you have to open the doors and let people in to see what's actually going on.

796
00:43:20,209 --> 00:43:23,870
Someone had said to me a little while ago that I have a reputation for giving a good no.

797
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:29,311
And I'm not really sure what that means other than I behave as a bouncer for Media Molecule,

798
00:43:29,331 --> 00:43:31,992
much as annoyance to people who want things from us.

799
00:43:32,592 --> 00:43:35,113
And sometimes that cake dish comes in very handy for me.

800
00:43:36,574 --> 00:43:41,437
The most important thing with making new things is that it's very challenging, but it's a lot of fun.

801
00:43:41,957 --> 00:43:45,238
If you have the team and you believe in their vision and you can actually do your job,

802
00:43:45,319 --> 00:43:48,680
then you should be on course to be able to do something, so you just need to not be afraid.

803
00:43:49,879 --> 00:43:52,602
When we were making LittleBigPlanet, we really had no idea what we were doing,

804
00:43:52,882 --> 00:43:55,625
and with regard to the logistics of the UGC service,

805
00:43:56,146 --> 00:43:57,427
we all learned that the hard way.

806
00:43:57,447 --> 00:44:01,591
And we didn't really know if anyone would create anything until the beta trials,

807
00:44:01,711 --> 00:44:04,534
which were a beta, which was probably too late to figure out anyway.

808
00:44:05,015 --> 00:44:08,698
But when we started to see those level numbers draw up, we were just so happy.

809
00:44:09,419 --> 00:44:13,702
We had this belief though in a united desire to jump into the unknown and give it a go

810
00:44:13,822 --> 00:44:14,883
and to figure it out as we went.

811
00:44:15,364 --> 00:44:19,226
And we lived in this world for six years and then decided that it was time to jump into

812
00:44:19,246 --> 00:44:22,309
another unknown with two new peers and it's been so hard.

813
00:44:22,969 --> 00:44:26,472
And the last years have seen many of us really overstretched and things taking longer than

814
00:44:26,512 --> 00:44:29,594
they should and many of our internal processes broken down.

815
00:44:30,375 --> 00:44:32,176
And it's been really hard, and we've got so much wrong.

816
00:44:32,216 --> 00:44:33,678
But I feel like, within production,

817
00:44:33,698 --> 00:44:35,999
we've been steering these icebergs.

818
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:38,522
But despite the mistakes that we've made,

819
00:44:38,682 --> 00:44:41,484
we've all learned lessons about the games we're making

820
00:44:42,065 --> 00:44:42,965
and the people that we are.

821
00:44:43,005 --> 00:44:46,008
And I think we're making games that only we would make,

822
00:44:46,128 --> 00:44:47,509
and there's something special about that.

823
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:50,332
I've had so many joyous moments, and I'm

824
00:44:50,372 --> 00:44:52,253
so happy to see the world of Tearaway come to life

825
00:44:52,293 --> 00:44:54,095
and the team overcome the challenges that they've had.

826
00:44:54,535 --> 00:44:56,717
And it's exciting to see everyone knuckle down

827
00:44:56,857 --> 00:44:57,638
for the final stretch.

828
00:44:58,866 --> 00:45:03,850
LBP and now Tearaway, our other project, will stretch us and the other one we announced, well we sort of showed some stuff off,

829
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:09,915
they will stretch us, but that's because we're sort of reaching for something and we're taking creative risks and we're taking studio risks

830
00:45:09,975 --> 00:45:11,396
and we're generally not staying still.

831
00:45:12,417 --> 00:45:17,221
But that does mean we can get to somewhere special and we're going to be telling a personal story and

832
00:45:17,261 --> 00:45:22,165
making, you know, making something close to us means that we can sort of deliver experiences that are really unique for our audiences.

833
00:45:24,085 --> 00:45:25,665
So yeah, so just coming back to these,

834
00:45:25,685 --> 00:45:28,366
I think these are, I'll probably write these on post-it notes

835
00:45:28,386 --> 00:45:29,606
and put them on my desk as well.

836
00:45:30,947 --> 00:45:32,507
So yes, these are two things to remember.

837
00:45:33,687 --> 00:45:35,568
So yes, glitter and doom.

838
00:45:36,828 --> 00:45:39,409
Making new things means that you have to be a good producer,

839
00:45:39,529 --> 00:45:41,270
probably a really good producer,

840
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:43,030
and we also just struggle with that,

841
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:44,411
having to learn like every day

842
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:46,311
and have days where I feel like I'm good

843
00:45:46,331 --> 00:45:47,972
and days where I feel like I'm really crap.

844
00:45:48,918 --> 00:45:52,880
But you just need to work hard, and you actually need to just love the glitter and doom of development.

845
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:57,882
So my core to action with any producers is that you will have joined the industry for a reason,

846
00:45:57,922 --> 00:46:02,844
and you've probably got a whole bankload of interests and passions and things that you're into.

847
00:46:03,584 --> 00:46:07,926
And you probably may have been knocked back at some point and told that production is unimportant,

848
00:46:08,086 --> 00:46:12,328
or you're not part of the team, or you're not creative, or you don't matter, or number crunches and all that stuff.

849
00:46:13,068 --> 00:46:14,929
But I just don't think we should work with people like that.

850
00:46:16,367 --> 00:46:18,709
I know that I can add things and I'm really confident about that.

851
00:46:19,350 --> 00:46:25,537
I think the way that we need to think about it is that we can be critical to making a

852
00:46:25,558 --> 00:46:32,065
game successful and we can be critical to helping teams birth new ideas and be a part

853
00:46:32,085 --> 00:46:33,026
of that process.

854
00:46:33,186 --> 00:46:34,808
You really can pull your team towards that.

855
00:46:35,429 --> 00:46:37,230
So even when you're just tracking something,

856
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:39,870
you need to be focused on the project being the best

857
00:46:39,890 --> 00:46:40,530
that it can be.

858
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:42,511
The industry right now isn't going

859
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:46,572
to keep teams that release average games.

860
00:46:47,172 --> 00:46:50,573
But it's also a moment where we can make things amazing.

861
00:46:50,633 --> 00:46:52,673
There's all sorts of games out there now

862
00:46:52,693 --> 00:46:54,754
on all sorts of different platforms.

863
00:46:55,394 --> 00:46:57,234
And a lot of the things that we all talk about and get

864
00:46:57,274 --> 00:46:59,215
celebrated in the awards ceremony last night

865
00:46:59,295 --> 00:47:00,655
are games that have personality.

866
00:47:01,355 --> 00:47:04,256
And their games celebrate the united creative direction

867
00:47:04,336 --> 00:47:05,277
of a studio.

868
00:47:05,317 --> 00:47:09,198
And I think that's truly the most rewarding work to do.

869
00:47:09,258 --> 00:47:11,099
So we should try to figure out how

870
00:47:11,139 --> 00:47:13,560
to help our studios towards that and be a part of that process.

871
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,661
So remember those words.

872
00:47:17,421 --> 00:47:17,781
Thank you.

873
00:47:17,962 --> 00:47:18,262
That's it.

874
00:47:21,903 --> 00:47:22,103
OK?

875
00:47:24,444 --> 00:47:24,544
OK.
