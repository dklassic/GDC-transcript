1
00:00:17,277 --> 00:00:24,238
We called it the Traveler, and its arrival changed us forever.

2
00:00:47,544 --> 00:00:49,426
But the traveler had an enemy.

3
00:01:17,221 --> 00:01:17,641
So welcome.

4
00:01:18,502 --> 00:01:19,383
My name is Tom Slattery.

5
00:01:19,563 --> 00:01:21,284
I am the localization manager at Bungie,

6
00:01:21,485 --> 00:01:22,606
and I'm here today to talk about

7
00:01:22,966 --> 00:01:24,767
how we delivered the universe of Destiny

8
00:01:25,048 --> 00:01:26,289
into the hands of millions of players

9
00:01:26,329 --> 00:01:28,350
in a way that would hopefully make them feel like

10
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:29,832
it was one that was created for them.

11
00:01:31,653 --> 00:01:34,275
So there's four main topics that I want to talk about today.

12
00:01:35,376 --> 00:01:38,199
The first one is how we went about building a world

13
00:01:38,279 --> 00:01:40,461
that would not only be as immersive as possible

14
00:01:40,641 --> 00:01:41,682
for everyone playing the game,

15
00:01:41,882 --> 00:01:43,563
no matter what language they were playing in

16
00:01:43,623 --> 00:01:44,624
or where they were in the world.

17
00:01:45,028 --> 00:01:47,590
but also one that would be easy for us to create and maintain.

18
00:01:50,231 --> 00:01:51,612
The second thing that I'm going to talk about

19
00:01:51,932 --> 00:01:53,694
is what we did beyond that in terms

20
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:56,696
of supporting the localized player experience, the things

21
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:00,158
that we did to make the game even better for players

22
00:02:00,198 --> 00:02:01,739
in other languages, even though we didn't

23
00:02:01,779 --> 00:02:02,760
need to do them for English.

24
00:02:05,101 --> 00:02:07,343
The third thing I'm just going to touch on briefly,

25
00:02:08,183 --> 00:02:11,125
but was our approach to localization for web and mobile.

26
00:02:11,886 --> 00:02:13,767
Destiny has a mobile companion.

27
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:17,012
that is spread across web, iOS and Android.

28
00:02:17,052 --> 00:02:19,694
So we also had to think about localization for that.

29
00:02:19,734 --> 00:02:23,476
And I think there's some things that we did there that are kind of interesting and possibly

30
00:02:23,556 --> 00:02:24,597
applicable to other people.

31
00:02:24,917 --> 00:02:26,278
So I want to touch briefly on that.

32
00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:31,361
And then the last thing is our approach to staffing for localization on Destiny.

33
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:34,904
What we did, why we did it, and what it allowed us to accomplish.

34
00:02:37,085 --> 00:02:38,847
So how do you build a world for the entire world?

35
00:02:41,542 --> 00:02:43,224
We had some unique challenges with Destiny.

36
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,166
One of the first things that we had to think about

37
00:02:46,206 --> 00:02:48,528
was the fact that the setting is essentially

38
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:49,769
a real world setting.

39
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:51,670
Obviously, if you've played Destiny,

40
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:52,591
it's set in the future.

41
00:02:53,011 --> 00:02:54,733
There's gratuitous space magic,

42
00:02:55,413 --> 00:02:56,614
but it's our solar system.

43
00:02:56,674 --> 00:02:58,235
It's the real world.

44
00:02:58,315 --> 00:02:59,676
Parts of the game take place on Earth,

45
00:02:59,817 --> 00:03:00,597
albeit in the future.

46
00:03:01,678 --> 00:03:03,019
So if you have a fantasy series,

47
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,241
something that's completely made up,

48
00:03:05,301 --> 00:03:06,882
like take Dune or Game of Thrones,

49
00:03:07,442 --> 00:03:09,344
it's set on a world that doesn't really exist.

50
00:03:09,912 --> 00:03:11,273
You can kind of suspend disbelief.

51
00:03:11,453 --> 00:03:13,675
You can have everyone speaking English and that works.

52
00:03:14,715 --> 00:03:18,638
In Destiny, it's set on Earth and in our solar system.

53
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,140
We have a real world and our real world has real languages.

54
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,301
So we have to be consistent with reality

55
00:03:23,682 --> 00:03:25,403
while also making the experience work

56
00:03:25,463 --> 00:03:26,423
for the players who are playing it.

57
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,340
The other challenge is that it's a shared universe.

58
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,661
So in Destiny, you could potentially be playing

59
00:03:34,801 --> 00:03:36,461
in the same place, in the same space,

60
00:03:36,761 --> 00:03:38,122
with someone else who's playing the game

61
00:03:38,362 --> 00:03:40,022
in a different language, in a different country.

62
00:03:40,722 --> 00:03:42,102
So we always had to keep that in mind too.

63
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:47,944
So one of the philosophical questions that pops up

64
00:03:47,984 --> 00:03:49,184
as soon as you start thinking about that,

65
00:03:49,204 --> 00:03:51,304
when you have players that are occupying the same spaces,

66
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:54,965
is do they see the world in the same way?

67
00:03:55,725 --> 00:03:56,946
How do their eyes perceive it?

68
00:03:56,966 --> 00:03:58,466
Do they see the same thing when they look at it?

69
00:03:58,934 --> 00:04:00,415
And the answer, at least for Destiny, is yes.

70
00:04:01,296 --> 00:04:03,738
We decided very early on, the decision was actually made

71
00:04:03,778 --> 00:04:05,940
before I started at Bungie, that we wouldn't localize

72
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,563
any art assets, we wouldn't localize any textures

73
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:09,544
or graphics in the game.

74
00:04:11,285 --> 00:04:12,646
And that wasn't to say that we would just give

75
00:04:12,867 --> 00:04:14,969
a decidedly American gesture to everyone playing

76
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:16,970
in other languages, it just meant that we were gonna take

77
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,212
a very calculated approach in how we built the world

78
00:04:19,252 --> 00:04:20,113
so that we wouldn't need to.

79
00:04:23,476 --> 00:04:24,177
So why did we do that?

80
00:04:24,217 --> 00:04:25,878
There's a few reasons, the obvious first one,

81
00:04:26,295 --> 00:04:30,037
is the resource drain. There's a cost associated with creating those extra assets. And I don't

82
00:04:30,077 --> 00:04:33,940
just mean a cost in terms of like dollars and cents cost. There's a cost to the project.

83
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,943
In any project you have limited amounts of time, resources, in terms of people, artists,

84
00:04:40,564 --> 00:04:44,927
and money. So when you think about how you're going to use that, all things being equal,

85
00:04:44,947 --> 00:04:49,810
personally, I would rather have an artist spend his or her time making more cool things

86
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,751
to put in the game or polishing the stuff that's in there.

87
00:04:52,201 --> 00:04:55,085
Rather than creating the same rusty sign in seven languages.

88
00:04:55,105 --> 00:04:56,988
And I'm a loke guy, so I usually get off on that stuff.

89
00:05:00,673 --> 00:05:04,499
But beyond that, there's also a couple of very concrete reasons why we decided that

90
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:06,101
it wouldn't make sense for us to localize art.

91
00:05:07,719 --> 00:05:09,540
The first one is what I touched on before.

92
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,581
It's a shared universe.

93
00:05:11,161 --> 00:05:13,522
So players exist in the same space.

94
00:05:14,303 --> 00:05:19,225
And the moment that you show two players who are in the same virtual space, different

95
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:21,867
things, you're essentially lying to those players.

96
00:05:22,247 --> 00:05:23,407
There's a glitch in the matrix.

97
00:05:23,567 --> 00:05:24,788
It's an inconsistent world.

98
00:05:25,188 --> 00:05:26,789
And we didn't want to create an inconsistent world.

99
00:05:26,829 --> 00:05:29,290
We wanted to create a persistent universe that was believable.

100
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:36,772
So you can imagine a situation if you've played Destiny strikes are basically cooperative

101
00:05:38,192 --> 00:05:41,894
repeatable missions that you can jump in and play with friends over and over.

102
00:05:42,334 --> 00:05:46,756
So you can imagine a situation where on a Friday night I ping my buddy in Japan and

103
00:05:47,717 --> 00:05:52,539
you know he gets on and we jump into a strike together and we're playing and we get to a

104
00:05:52,579 --> 00:05:57,301
certain point where he's like, okay, I need you to focus on that guy with the red dots

105
00:05:57,341 --> 00:05:57,761
on his armor.

106
00:05:57,821 --> 00:05:59,262
I'm going to go take care of those other dudes.

107
00:06:00,468 --> 00:06:03,410
And I'm like, dude, I have absolutely no, where are you?

108
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,210
What's going on?

109
00:06:04,471 --> 00:06:06,372
I don't even see a guy with red dots on it,

110
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:08,754
but this Stars and Stripes guy's kicking my ass.

111
00:06:10,975 --> 00:06:12,316
So you can think of situations like that.

112
00:06:12,376 --> 00:06:15,118
I mean, obviously that's a little bit exaggerated,

113
00:06:15,158 --> 00:06:17,240
but you could think of things like a sign

114
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,361
on the top of a building that you're using as a waypoint,

115
00:06:19,841 --> 00:06:21,623
or maybe you get separated from your friend

116
00:06:21,643 --> 00:06:23,224
and you're trying to describe the things you see.

117
00:06:23,324 --> 00:06:27,407
So you spell off a logo that's on the side of a building

118
00:06:27,427 --> 00:06:28,147
or something like that.

119
00:06:28,615 --> 00:06:30,316
And those sorts of things are where it breaks down

120
00:06:30,396 --> 00:06:31,757
when you have players in the same space.

121
00:06:34,638 --> 00:06:36,899
The other reason is again something I touched on before,

122
00:06:36,999 --> 00:06:39,160
the real world setting and also the fiction

123
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,000
that builds off of that.

124
00:06:40,581 --> 00:06:44,182
So for example, parts of the game take place in old Russia.

125
00:06:44,622 --> 00:06:47,384
When you're in old Russia, obviously signs are in Russian

126
00:06:47,404 --> 00:06:48,944
because that's what they speak in Russia.

127
00:06:50,005 --> 00:06:51,425
And there's also fictional backstory

128
00:06:51,465 --> 00:06:53,346
behind the other destinations that you go to in the game.

129
00:06:55,387 --> 00:06:57,068
So fictionally in Destiny.

130
00:06:57,407 --> 00:07:01,209
There is a base on the moon, and that was developed by China.

131
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:03,890
So all the signage for the moon base is in Chinese.

132
00:07:06,351 --> 00:07:09,152
We also have colonies that are on Mars and Venus.

133
00:07:10,292 --> 00:07:12,693
And these are fictionally English-speaking colonies,

134
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:14,534
so all the signage there is in English.

135
00:07:16,074 --> 00:07:17,595
The one thing that I would point out there is

136
00:07:18,195 --> 00:07:20,196
it's very easy to fall into the trap

137
00:07:20,536 --> 00:07:22,457
of being an American developer

138
00:07:22,597 --> 00:07:23,977
or being someone who only speaks English.

139
00:07:24,601 --> 00:07:26,381
and naturally just wanting to make everything

140
00:07:26,602 --> 00:07:28,062
fictionally English because it's easier.

141
00:07:28,662 --> 00:07:30,122
If that were the case throughout the entire game,

142
00:07:30,663 --> 00:07:33,663
the end result for players is that it still is going to feel

143
00:07:33,723 --> 00:07:35,564
like a half localized experience.

144
00:07:35,724 --> 00:07:37,784
You might be able to justify it fictionally all you want,

145
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:39,745
but when you jump into the game playing in French

146
00:07:40,225 --> 00:07:42,546
and you're seeing everything you look at in English,

147
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:44,546
it doesn't really jive.

148
00:07:44,826 --> 00:07:48,287
So the way that it actually turned out in our game,

149
00:07:48,707 --> 00:07:50,688
you start off initially in old Russia.

150
00:07:51,397 --> 00:07:55,720
And then you go to the moon, so you're getting this progression of Russian text on signs

151
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,481
and then Chinese text on signs.

152
00:07:57,902 --> 00:08:01,584
And by the time you make it to Mars and Venus, as a player, you've kind of been trained.

153
00:08:01,965 --> 00:08:04,146
You know that that information is not gameplay relevant.

154
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:08,570
You know that you don't need to pay attention to the signs, that it's basically decoration.

155
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,912
So it builds the atmosphere and fiction of the world.

156
00:08:11,512 --> 00:08:15,916
But it still doesn't give that impression that we just didn't localize it because we

157
00:08:15,936 --> 00:08:16,596
didn't want to.

158
00:08:16,716 --> 00:08:18,838
It's clear that it's an intentional fictional decision.

159
00:08:23,213 --> 00:08:27,155
So there were, of course, some challenges associated with this. One of the big ones

160
00:08:27,255 --> 00:08:31,017
is working with text and languages that you don't have support for is very difficult.

161
00:08:31,717 --> 00:08:35,258
And just about everything that can go wrong will and did. So we had things like

162
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:40,900
Concept artists who decided to go off and they wanted to make some Chinese concept art,

163
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,564
so they pulled out Chinese propaganda posters on Google, started picking characters at random.

164
00:08:46,084 --> 00:08:49,907
You know, nothing that actually was problematic, it was just gibberish, but the kind of thing

165
00:08:49,927 --> 00:08:50,748
that makes you really nervous.

166
00:08:51,309 --> 00:08:56,353
We had things where maybe something like that happened and then the designer actually provided

167
00:08:56,493 --> 00:09:00,897
an updated version for artists to implement that had correct Chinese or Russian text on

168
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:01,017
it.

169
00:09:01,837 --> 00:09:03,839
But the artist who went to implement it

170
00:09:04,283 --> 00:09:07,085
noticed it was different from the original concept art and corrected it back to what

171
00:09:07,105 --> 00:09:12,530
it was or that sort of thing. We also had Russian signage, for example, where the text

172
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:16,754
got flipped upside down or backwards, which is a really easy mistake to make because Russian

173
00:09:16,794 --> 00:09:20,096
is basically just like the English alphabet with half the characters turned backwards.

174
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:26,662
But if you don't speak Russian, it's really hard to notice that sort of thing. So we ended

175
00:09:26,742 --> 00:09:32,067
up in the end having to go through and have testers take screenshots in the environment

176
00:09:32,247 --> 00:09:32,727
of every...

177
00:09:34,369 --> 00:09:38,692
foreign language text and send it off for review through professional Russian and Chinese

178
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:43,075
game translators to make sure that everything worked in context, was implemented correctly,

179
00:09:43,615 --> 00:09:46,818
and wasn't offensive, which was another problem we encountered because

180
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:51,760
It turns out you might have something that's perfectly fine, but then you put some dirt

181
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,965
and rust on the sign and cover up a few characters and suddenly it says something different.

182
00:09:55,985 --> 00:10:00,910
Like you can imagine in English a sign that said, wanted assassin, where the end of the

183
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:03,473
word gets a little bit obscured and it says something very different.

184
00:10:03,913 --> 00:10:07,778
So yeah, we had those kind of problems, quite a few actually, that we had to fix.

185
00:10:10,997 --> 00:10:15,680
Another problem that we had was something like I mentioned before, having mostly English

186
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,423
speaking developers, there's sort of this bias, this natural tendency to go English

187
00:10:19,463 --> 00:10:25,087
with everything. So there was English everywhere in the game. We had things like people wanting

188
00:10:25,127 --> 00:10:28,689
to put English translations on all the signs that were in other languages or just wanting

189
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:30,851
to put English signs everywhere because they wanted more text.

190
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:35,274
And the biggest challenge of all was the tower.

191
00:10:36,998 --> 00:10:40,921
If you haven't played Destiny, the tower is sort of our hub space, our social space where

192
00:10:41,302 --> 00:10:42,583
players go back between missions.

193
00:10:45,265 --> 00:10:51,189
So in the early versions of the tower, we had essentially guide posts that would tell

194
00:10:51,229 --> 00:10:53,491
you where all of the things in the tower were.

195
00:10:53,531 --> 00:10:55,172
There was no mini-map or anything like that.

196
00:10:55,632 --> 00:10:59,655
So your only way of really getting information about where things were other than exploring

197
00:10:59,675 --> 00:11:01,837
the whole space was to go up to the signs and read them.

198
00:11:02,557 --> 00:11:05,560
So early on, this is an early concept that we had.

199
00:11:07,239 --> 00:11:11,540
The design of the tower has gone through a lot of iteration over the past few years before

200
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:16,882
launch so at this point in time the tower contained three different sectors basically

201
00:11:16,922 --> 00:11:20,563
that we had called the underwatch, the military district, and the bazaar.

202
00:11:21,123 --> 00:11:25,584
And each of these areas had different factions in it, each one was associated with a different

203
00:11:25,604 --> 00:11:30,086
player class so you know the hangout for the titans was in the underwatch and that sort

204
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:30,326
of thing.

205
00:11:30,954 --> 00:11:36,855
So, the basic art that they had created for that was a big capital letter that was the

206
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:41,036
first letter of the name of the section, so U for Underwatch, which makes perfect sense

207
00:11:41,056 --> 00:11:43,617
when you're playing in English and the word for Underwatch starts with a U.

208
00:11:44,297 --> 00:11:49,558
Then the name of it in English underneath and the list of all the NPCs and vendors and

209
00:11:49,578 --> 00:11:50,818
things that you could find in that area.

210
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:55,479
Which again, if you're playing in any other language than English, isn't really helpful

211
00:11:55,619 --> 00:11:56,920
because none of that means anything.

212
00:11:57,492 --> 00:12:01,115
The names of those areas are going to be translated, so Underwatch won't be Underwatch.

213
00:12:01,515 --> 00:12:05,218
The names of the classes have been translated, so Titans aren't necessarily Titans.

214
00:12:06,619 --> 00:12:09,040
It's basically just not helpful.

215
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,343
And if that's the only way that players are getting that information, then you're basically

216
00:12:12,903 --> 00:12:17,826
failing to convey important gameplay information to other players in other languages.

217
00:12:19,688 --> 00:12:23,190
So we took another stab at it, and this was the next iteration of that, where we said,

218
00:12:23,851 --> 00:12:28,593
We can't use the acronym approach. We can't take the first letter of each one. Let's just

219
00:12:28,653 --> 00:12:32,834
call these sectors, like, sector A, B, and C. Because that makes sense to anyone who

220
00:12:32,874 --> 00:12:37,856
sees it. So this is, you know, sector B here, which is the military district, the former

221
00:12:37,896 --> 00:12:42,738
military district. Let's just put all the languages on there. So let's just translate

222
00:12:42,758 --> 00:12:45,999
it into all the languages that we support in Destiny and throw all those on a sign.

223
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,221
And this is Google translation, by the way. So if the thing in Russian says something

224
00:12:50,241 --> 00:12:53,322
offensive, I'm very sorry. I should have probably checked that.

225
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,294
But there's some problems with this, too.

226
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,514
You've got a whole bunch of languages,

227
00:12:58,554 --> 00:13:00,915
which makes it really difficult as a player

228
00:13:01,255 --> 00:13:03,255
to walk up to the sign and get the information that you need.

229
00:13:03,676 --> 00:13:06,076
Like, even in this example, I think there's six here,

230
00:13:06,456 --> 00:13:09,697
but if you're looking at six different languages

231
00:13:09,857 --> 00:13:12,277
that say the same thing, it's a lot of information.

232
00:13:12,297 --> 00:13:13,558
You're gonna have to scan through and go,

233
00:13:13,698 --> 00:13:14,778
oh, oh, there's the one I can read.

234
00:13:14,818 --> 00:13:16,638
That's the little tidbit of information I need.

235
00:13:17,538 --> 00:13:18,779
It's also not sustainable, right?

236
00:13:18,859 --> 00:13:20,779
Like, if we want to add more languages over time,

237
00:13:21,499 --> 00:13:24,880
If we, you know, tomorrow decided to add another language to Destiny, we'd have to go through

238
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:30,922
and either update all this art or not provide that information to players in that language,

239
00:13:30,942 --> 00:13:31,802
which would be kind of terrible.

240
00:13:32,722 --> 00:13:35,003
And what do you do if we end up with like 10 or 12 languages?

241
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:37,744
Then suddenly you can't even squeeze that much stuff onto a sign.

242
00:13:38,024 --> 00:13:40,004
So we didn't really like that approach.

243
00:13:40,725 --> 00:13:44,125
Artistically, I mean, the art team also just didn't like it because it's messy, it doesn't

244
00:13:44,145 --> 00:13:44,486
look good.

245
00:13:46,466 --> 00:13:47,907
So some challenging problems there.

246
00:13:49,897 --> 00:13:52,839
The other problem that I mentioned was English everywhere and that was something that we

247
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:54,079
very much had in the tower.

248
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,962
This is an example of a very early build.

249
00:13:58,022 --> 00:14:01,504
One of my favorite games when I started working at Bungie was to prop a new build every morning

250
00:14:01,904 --> 00:14:05,947
and go into the tower and see how much more English text the artist had put all over everything.

251
00:14:06,407 --> 00:14:11,070
So this is actually from an email I used to take screenshots and send to my manager who

252
00:14:11,471 --> 00:14:15,713
used to handle localization at Bungie and vent and get angry.

253
00:14:17,409 --> 00:14:20,891
Obviously you can tell I'm a loke guy. This was a build before our character heads were

254
00:14:20,911 --> 00:14:24,633
rendering so I'm running around in the tower. My character has no head and the thing that

255
00:14:24,653 --> 00:14:29,195
I'm really upset about is the tiny little wording beneath the picture on the sign. But

256
00:14:29,215 --> 00:14:32,237
this is an example where that one might be kind of hard to read up there but it says

257
00:14:32,317 --> 00:14:37,920
new monarchy. New monarchy is one of the factions in Destiny. But in other languages it's not

258
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:42,102
new monarchy. In French it might be nouveau monarchy or something. I don't actually speak

259
00:14:42,162 --> 00:14:46,085
French. And it's also just kind of

260
00:14:47,021 --> 00:14:50,905
It breaks immersion. It's weird that you're playing the game, for example, in German.

261
00:14:51,505 --> 00:14:55,849
You're in the tower. All the characters are speaking German. All the signs are in English.

262
00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:00,053
It doesn't really make sense. Like, fictionally, if you're playing the game in Italian, for

263
00:15:00,093 --> 00:15:05,258
you, the tower is an Italian space. The characters speak Italian. So you would want things to

264
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:11,484
be in Italian, right? So how do we solve this? We've got this decision

265
00:15:11,504 --> 00:15:12,625
that we're not going to localize any art.

266
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,882
We've got a setting that contains a mix of languages.

267
00:15:16,402 --> 00:15:20,505
We've got this tower that's a kind of complex problem where we need to make it feel like

268
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:21,285
home for everyone.

269
00:15:22,586 --> 00:15:25,548
How do we go about setting rules to make sure that everybody has a good experience?

270
00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:32,552
The first is, do not communicate any important information through text and graphics.

271
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,022
There can't be anything like a this way sign,

272
00:15:35,922 --> 00:15:37,964
like the guide posts are a good example.

273
00:15:38,324 --> 00:15:40,426
Any information like that that needs to be communicated

274
00:15:40,446 --> 00:15:42,687
to players needs to be communicated in some other way.

275
00:15:42,888 --> 00:15:44,729
So through the UI, which can be localized,

276
00:15:45,089 --> 00:15:47,351
through dialogue, through some kind of visual cues

277
00:15:47,371 --> 00:15:49,332
in the environment that give that information to players

278
00:15:49,352 --> 00:15:50,533
without spelling it out.

279
00:15:54,096 --> 00:15:57,078
Next is avoiding what I call Anglo-centricism.

280
00:15:57,098 --> 00:15:59,020
This is the thing that I was talking about before,

281
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,901
that trap that it's really easy to fall into

282
00:16:00,941 --> 00:16:03,123
when you only speak a particular language.

283
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,261
Don't just put everything in English.

284
00:16:06,321 --> 00:16:07,842
Try to show, I mean, we have a world

285
00:16:08,002 --> 00:16:10,863
that has diversity of language, so show that in the game.

286
00:16:11,283 --> 00:16:13,705
Try to show that we have multiple languages

287
00:16:13,745 --> 00:16:14,985
in this universe wherever you can.

288
00:16:15,726 --> 00:16:18,067
Avoid putting English translation on things

289
00:16:18,167 --> 00:16:19,187
just because you can.

290
00:16:20,248 --> 00:16:22,489
The problem with that is that same thing

291
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:25,931
where suddenly instead of having this diversity of language,

292
00:16:26,271 --> 00:16:27,772
you're showing again that this is a game

293
00:16:27,812 --> 00:16:29,833
that was made for people who speak English,

294
00:16:29,993 --> 00:16:31,594
but you know, you can play it too.

295
00:16:31,954 --> 00:16:33,535
And that's not the impression that we wanna give people.

296
00:16:34,951 --> 00:16:38,152
And also just don't use English text where you don't have to.

297
00:16:38,192 --> 00:16:40,314
I mean, it's fine if there's some text here and there,

298
00:16:41,154 --> 00:16:42,775
but if it's everywhere, it starts to be

299
00:16:42,795 --> 00:16:45,517
that constant reminder, that sort of constant slap

300
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:47,498
in the face reminder that this game

301
00:16:47,538 --> 00:16:48,538
wasn't really made for you.

302
00:16:52,741 --> 00:16:54,181
The third, which is very important,

303
00:16:54,582 --> 00:16:56,443
was solving the problem of how to make the tower

304
00:16:56,943 --> 00:16:58,404
feel like home for everyone.

305
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:00,865
Because again, the tower is our hub space.

306
00:17:00,925 --> 00:17:01,926
It's fictionally.

307
00:17:02,413 --> 00:17:04,995
where all of the characters, which we call guardians, are from.

308
00:17:05,335 --> 00:17:05,996
That's where they live.

309
00:17:06,456 --> 00:17:07,077
It's your home.

310
00:17:07,237 --> 00:17:10,460
And it would be very strange to return home and find a place

311
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,203
where you didn't really feel like you felt a part of the community.

312
00:17:14,623 --> 00:17:15,904
It wasn't for you.

313
00:17:16,485 --> 00:17:19,747
So we needed to make it feel like an international space somehow.

314
00:17:19,827 --> 00:17:21,989
We need to give all players the impression

315
00:17:22,029 --> 00:17:24,892
that this is not just a place where English speakers live.

316
00:17:24,912 --> 00:17:27,314
This is a place that is filled with a lot of different people.

317
00:17:27,634 --> 00:17:28,935
It's the last city on Earth.

318
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,557
So it makes sense that there's a cultural mix there.

319
00:17:34,537 --> 00:17:36,058
Fourth, this is the one I mentioned before.

320
00:17:36,438 --> 00:17:39,520
Absolutely avoid defacing or obscuring text on signs.

321
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:46,265
We had quite a few issues with this and we eventually just made the rule that any text

322
00:17:46,305 --> 00:17:50,608
in a foreign language or English on a sign needed to be kept the way that it was originally

323
00:17:50,628 --> 00:17:53,931
created and not covered up in any way that could make it say something else.

324
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:55,092
It's very important.

325
00:17:55,569 --> 00:17:59,294
in this situation. Because if you make the decision not to localize art, even if you're

326
00:17:59,314 --> 00:18:03,180
just putting up signs in English, you need to make sure that that English text doesn't

327
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:09,729
mean genitalia in Italian or that sort of thing. You need to run each example of signage

328
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:12,453
through all of the languages you support to make sure that it works for them.

329
00:18:15,779 --> 00:18:18,400
And finally, no references to the English terminology.

330
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,181
Things like taking the first letter of the term in English,

331
00:18:21,241 --> 00:18:23,141
which may not be the same in another language,

332
00:18:23,221 --> 00:18:25,842
or putting the names of factions up on signs

333
00:18:25,882 --> 00:18:28,063
where that name would actually be something different

334
00:18:28,243 --> 00:18:28,903
in another language.

335
00:18:29,623 --> 00:18:32,444
So there are some things that we purposefully decided

336
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:33,625
that we would not localize,

337
00:18:34,265 --> 00:18:35,665
like the weapon foundry names,

338
00:18:35,725 --> 00:18:37,606
the names of our NPCs in the game,

339
00:18:38,086 --> 00:18:39,366
that are the same across all languages

340
00:18:39,426 --> 00:18:40,987
and give us things that are safe to use.

341
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:42,067
But for the most part,

342
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,348
all terminology in the game gets localized.

343
00:18:46,832 --> 00:18:53,237
Almost. This is my badge of shame. This is my one big localization fail on Destiny. This

344
00:18:53,277 --> 00:18:57,620
was already on a T-shirt in our store when I started working at Bungie, so it was kind

345
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:02,624
of a little bit too late. It was all over the tower. But this is the logo for one of

346
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:08,469
our other factions called the Future War Cult. And obviously the logo is an acronym for Future

347
00:19:08,489 --> 00:19:08,869
War Cult.

348
00:19:09,617 --> 00:19:15,460
You can probably imagine translating future war cult into seven other languages in a way

349
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:21,083
that preserves the meaning and also happens to start with the initials FWC is not achievable.

350
00:19:21,543 --> 00:19:26,846
So some languages fare it a little better than others but FWC only really works for

351
00:19:27,627 --> 00:19:28,187
a couple of them.

352
00:19:28,247 --> 00:19:33,510
So most of our languages, the logo here doesn't actually match the term for the faction name

353
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:36,052
and that's kind of sad if you're a localization person.

354
00:19:37,373 --> 00:19:40,956
We do, if you've played the game, there's also an alternate logo, which is just the F.

355
00:19:41,617 --> 00:19:45,301
And one of the, you know, solutions I propose to try to mitigate that in the future is

356
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:48,764
let's just try to use that one where we can, because that does work for most languages.

357
00:19:48,884 --> 00:19:54,389
Future, in most European languages, still starts with an F, so that one doesn't feel as off as FWC.

358
00:19:58,163 --> 00:20:00,444
So how did we go about solving all of the problems in the tower?

359
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:05,166
One thing that we did was pull out information that we needed into the UI.

360
00:20:05,206 --> 00:20:08,187
So like I said before, originally we had no map in the tower.

361
00:20:08,247 --> 00:20:10,568
The only way you were getting the information about where things were

362
00:20:10,989 --> 00:20:12,249
was to go look at those guideposts.

363
00:20:12,749 --> 00:20:14,650
So we actually pulled that out and we did implement a map.

364
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:17,471
And the map is all UI, so we're able to localize that

365
00:20:17,511 --> 00:20:19,893
and provide that information to players in all languages.

366
00:20:19,933 --> 00:20:22,994
So you can pull up a map of the tower, see what the different areas are called,

367
00:20:23,114 --> 00:20:25,995
see what the different vendors and things are in that space.

368
00:20:28,116 --> 00:20:29,977
So any of that critical information needs to go in there.

369
00:20:30,157 --> 00:20:32,878
You can't rely on the environment art to provide that to players.

370
00:20:34,139 --> 00:20:37,940
Another thing we did was try to lean on iconography wherever we can.

371
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:41,882
So teach players what icons mean and then use those,

372
00:20:41,962 --> 00:20:43,843
rather than putting the text for it.

373
00:20:43,883 --> 00:20:47,624
So this is the final New Monarchy faction space in the tower

374
00:20:47,665 --> 00:20:48,445
that we actually shipped.

375
00:20:49,005 --> 00:20:52,467
And you can see on the left, it still has that triangular logo

376
00:20:52,487 --> 00:20:53,107
for New Monarchy.

377
00:20:55,192 --> 00:20:58,575
under it, it just stops there. And players know that because they've seen that symbol

378
00:20:58,595 --> 00:21:01,958
a lot. They know it's associated with the faction. There's no reason to put a sign on

379
00:21:01,978 --> 00:21:02,178
them all.

380
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:09,852
Another thing that we did to cut down just on the amount of English text, one of the

381
00:21:09,892 --> 00:21:13,814
problems with cutting out all text together is human beings use text.

382
00:21:14,054 --> 00:21:17,657
So if you just cut all of the text out of an environment, it starts to feel fake.

383
00:21:17,677 --> 00:21:19,698
It doesn't feel like a real inhabited human space.

384
00:21:20,218 --> 00:21:25,201
So part of the pushback that I got from the artistic side on removing text was just that.

385
00:21:25,261 --> 00:21:29,663
They still wanted to be able to use text in their designs to make the space look inhabited.

386
00:21:30,224 --> 00:21:33,586
So one of the things that we did was try to find things that were globally palatable.

387
00:21:34,046 --> 00:21:34,967
So for example...

388
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,551
The names of the weapon foundries, like I mentioned,

389
00:21:37,591 --> 00:21:39,232
we kept the same across all languages.

390
00:21:39,452 --> 00:21:41,112
We made sure that those names would work

391
00:21:41,732 --> 00:21:43,233
in all the languages we were shipping,

392
00:21:43,293 --> 00:21:44,814
so things you can see in that image,

393
00:21:44,874 --> 00:21:46,654
like Omolon and Suros,

394
00:21:47,174 --> 00:21:48,915
those are some of our weapon foundries,

395
00:21:49,195 --> 00:21:51,616
and we used a lot of those on labels and things

396
00:21:51,756 --> 00:21:54,637
to just add some text for decoration.

397
00:21:55,117 --> 00:21:57,038
We also use things like industrial gibberish,

398
00:21:57,078 --> 00:21:59,479
so just numbers and letters that don't mean anything,

399
00:21:59,619 --> 00:22:00,919
you know, labels on a crate,

400
00:22:01,479 --> 00:22:02,780
so that it feels like a real object,

401
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,360
but it doesn't necessarily say something.

402
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:04,780
It doesn't.

403
00:22:05,187 --> 00:22:09,429
remind people that it's all English because it's not. It's just numbers and letters.

404
00:22:11,929 --> 00:22:15,651
Latin is also easy to fall back on because Latin is just cool and nobody knows what it

405
00:22:15,671 --> 00:22:20,312
says and the U's are V's and it's, you know, it's Latin. So we put a little of that in

406
00:22:20,332 --> 00:22:26,134
there too in places. And we did actually go back to using some

407
00:22:26,154 --> 00:22:30,755
multilingual signage. So this is how that guide post ended up in the final tower.

408
00:22:31,422 --> 00:22:32,882
We don't rely on it anymore.

409
00:22:33,062 --> 00:22:35,103
It's basically just decorative because there's a map.

410
00:22:35,363 --> 00:22:38,104
You can find out where the stuff is without reading this.

411
00:22:38,765 --> 00:22:43,047
But artistically, we just decided to narrow it down

412
00:22:43,087 --> 00:22:43,827
to three languages.

413
00:22:43,887 --> 00:22:45,828
We just went with English, Brazilian, Portuguese,

414
00:22:45,868 --> 00:22:46,428
and Japanese.

415
00:22:47,228 --> 00:22:51,950
So it accomplishes the idea of telling people

416
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:53,171
this is an international space.

417
00:22:53,331 --> 00:22:54,792
There are not only English speakers here,

418
00:22:54,872 --> 00:22:56,632
or only speakers of whatever language

419
00:22:56,652 --> 00:22:57,893
you're playing the game in and hearing.

420
00:22:57,913 --> 00:23:00,394
It's a space inhabited by lots of different people.

421
00:23:01,622 --> 00:23:06,345
But it also solves the problem of us not needing to redo all of the art if we ever add another

422
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,987
language or anything like that.

423
00:23:11,149 --> 00:23:13,011
So how did we arrive at those decisions?

424
00:23:13,071 --> 00:23:16,173
Well, mostly through a lot of challenging compromise.

425
00:23:17,094 --> 00:23:21,678
And I think that's an important, it's important to have those healthy discussions about what's

426
00:23:21,698 --> 00:23:25,701
important for localization but then what does that mean in terms of art or story or that

427
00:23:25,741 --> 00:23:26,181
sort of thing.

428
00:23:26,221 --> 00:23:30,145
So a lot of these decisions came about after a lot of discussion with a lot of people.

429
00:23:30,892 --> 00:23:34,933
So one example of that is what we call the human colonial palette,

430
00:23:35,293 --> 00:23:38,674
the set of textures that gets used on Venus and Mars where all the text is English.

431
00:23:39,214 --> 00:23:42,475
Like I said before, if that had been the decision for everything,

432
00:23:42,695 --> 00:23:45,135
that every space in the game was just fictionally English,

433
00:23:45,495 --> 00:23:46,196
that wouldn't have worked.

434
00:23:46,636 --> 00:23:47,976
And I would have protested that decision,

435
00:23:48,156 --> 00:23:51,297
but because of the way we present this in the game, it works.

436
00:23:51,717 --> 00:23:53,557
And so I think this was a good place to just say,

437
00:23:53,577 --> 00:23:56,098
you know what, it's okay that both of those spaces are English

438
00:23:56,218 --> 00:23:58,738
because it's not really a problem the way it is right now.

439
00:24:02,277 --> 00:24:04,617
Another example is the multilingual tower signage.

440
00:24:04,657 --> 00:24:08,939
That was a compromise in the end of going back and forth,

441
00:24:09,139 --> 00:24:10,779
having a lot of discussions with the art team

442
00:24:10,819 --> 00:24:14,260
about what looks good and what's sustainable

443
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:14,981
and things like that.

444
00:24:15,021 --> 00:24:16,341
And we ended up with something that I think

445
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:18,082
accomplishes what both sides wanted,

446
00:24:18,402 --> 00:24:21,303
which is giving that impression of a multicultural society

447
00:24:21,403 --> 00:24:22,123
that lives in the city,

448
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:26,784
but also not putting every single language on the wall.

449
00:24:29,685 --> 00:24:31,086
Another one that I hadn't talked about was

450
00:24:31,892 --> 00:24:35,315
We used to have a lot of text on our weapons. That was another thing I used to take screenshots

451
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:40,319
of all the time and send in angry emails. All English, of course. But you'd get things

452
00:24:40,339 --> 00:24:44,582
that were literally in your face. Almost every scope on every gun had English text on it

453
00:24:44,642 --> 00:24:49,306
that was very often associated with the city. Things like city armory, blah, blah, blah.

454
00:24:49,746 --> 00:24:54,330
So again, it's feeding that impression that the city is an English-speaking city, which

455
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:57,713
doesn't jive with what people are getting when they're playing the game in another language.

456
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:02,335
So we looked at that and we ended up making pretty good compromises.

457
00:25:02,395 --> 00:25:04,758
We tried to pull it off where it was extremely visible like that.

458
00:25:05,779 --> 00:25:07,081
We left some text in places.

459
00:25:07,121 --> 00:25:13,809
There's things like on the safety of a weapon, F and S for fire and safe are used generally

460
00:25:13,849 --> 00:25:16,572
by international weapons manufacturers, so it's normal.

461
00:25:16,949 --> 00:25:20,972
to see that even though it's English. So we kept things like that. And we didn't remove

462
00:25:21,112 --> 00:25:25,576
all of the text because there's some weapons that have, you know, the names of the weapon

463
00:25:25,616 --> 00:25:30,299
manufacturers which some of those are not English words. So you get a nice mix and it's

464
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:34,683
not all over the place. So we did cut out a lot of it. We tried to remove anything that

465
00:25:34,723 --> 00:25:39,127
fictionally wouldn't work in relation to the tower in the city, but we left some of it.

466
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:46,302
And another one that was kind of similar was the opening cinematic for the game.

467
00:25:46,362 --> 00:25:50,666
So if you've played Destiny, there's this opening movie which you're about to see where

468
00:25:50,706 --> 00:25:52,207
there's some astronauts walking on Mars.

469
00:25:52,867 --> 00:25:53,708
And it has text in it.

470
00:25:54,869 --> 00:25:59,452
And our initial plan was just to render out the video in seven languages and everything

471
00:25:59,492 --> 00:25:59,853
was fine.

472
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:00,593
And we did that.

473
00:26:01,314 --> 00:26:02,255
It wasn't going to be a problem.

474
00:26:02,675 --> 00:26:07,038
And then all of a sudden at one point we didn't have enough space on disk and it was a problem.

475
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:11,362
So of course the art team said, yeah, you're going to have to subtitle that.

476
00:26:11,422 --> 00:26:11,922
And I said, well.

477
00:26:12,545 --> 00:26:14,666
Well, we could do that, but then again,

478
00:26:14,686 --> 00:26:17,388
this is the first thing that players see

479
00:26:17,448 --> 00:26:19,349
when they pop in the game is this opening movie,

480
00:26:19,709 --> 00:26:21,190
and the impression that they're going to get is,

481
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:23,931
this is a game that was made for English speakers,

482
00:26:24,911 --> 00:26:26,232
and I have to watch it with subtitles,

483
00:26:26,412 --> 00:26:27,593
which is not a very good impression.

484
00:26:27,893 --> 00:26:29,454
So the compromise that we made

485
00:26:29,914 --> 00:26:32,295
was to alter the artistic direction

486
00:26:32,875 --> 00:26:35,376
of the video a little bit to work in multiple languages,

487
00:26:35,717 --> 00:26:37,017
again, just a sampling,

488
00:26:37,578 --> 00:26:40,099
but where it would appear to be an artistic choice.

489
00:26:41,261 --> 00:26:46,584
And players who spoke one of the languages that were in there would be getting that information through there.

490
00:26:47,024 --> 00:26:49,865
And players for the other languages, where we did have to throw in a subtitle,

491
00:26:50,345 --> 00:26:54,047
wouldn't think that it was, oh well this is just an American game and that's why it's this way.

492
00:26:54,087 --> 00:26:57,789
It's, oh well, this is the artistic direction and they have these three languages in there,

493
00:26:57,829 --> 00:27:01,291
but they're providing this information because not all players speak those languages.

494
00:27:02,531 --> 00:27:04,032
So here's where we landed in the end.

495
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:21,570
So, I mean, we don't really explain it.

496
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,871
And as a player, you can sort of interpret that however you want.

497
00:27:24,891 --> 00:27:28,332
There's three astronauts, there's three languages, maybe they're from different countries and

498
00:27:28,352 --> 00:27:29,253
speak different languages.

499
00:27:29,853 --> 00:27:33,534
It's kind of up to you to interpret, but it solved the problem.

500
00:27:34,114 --> 00:27:37,075
It didn't make the first thing that players see an English-only experience.

501
00:27:38,295 --> 00:27:43,057
So, I basically told you that I was going to give a talk about localizing destiny,

502
00:27:43,177 --> 00:27:44,337
and I've spent half an hour.

503
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:46,811
basically explaining how we didn't localize Destiny.

504
00:27:47,211 --> 00:27:49,072
So I'm gonna actually switch modes now

505
00:27:49,152 --> 00:27:50,452
and talk about the things that we did do.

506
00:27:52,073 --> 00:27:53,733
How did we go about making the game

507
00:27:53,953 --> 00:27:55,353
better for players in other languages?

508
00:27:56,114 --> 00:27:58,494
So one of the big differences between Destiny

509
00:27:59,035 --> 00:28:01,535
and the games that Bungie had been making, like Halo,

510
00:28:02,616 --> 00:28:04,356
was that you can create your own character

511
00:28:04,396 --> 00:28:06,217
and invest very, very deeply in it.

512
00:28:07,897 --> 00:28:09,638
So in Halo, you were Master Chief.

513
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:11,258
Master Chief was you.

514
00:28:12,619 --> 00:28:13,959
Master Chief was a dude.

515
00:28:15,638 --> 00:28:20,283
In Destiny, you don't have to be a dude. You can create a character, you can choose your

516
00:28:20,863 --> 00:28:28,611
race, your class, your perks, your weapons, your gear, and your gender. So if you're a

517
00:28:28,631 --> 00:28:32,616
player playing the game in English, the gender choice doesn't really have a lot of impact.

518
00:28:32,856 --> 00:28:37,601
It changes the voice for your character, it changes your model, but that's basically it.

519
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:38,782
It's a cosmetic decision.

520
00:28:39,688 --> 00:28:43,830
In other languages, that's not the case, especially for romance languages like French, Italian,

521
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:48,312
Spanish, Portuguese. The very concept of gender is built into the language and the grammar.

522
00:28:48,772 --> 00:28:54,095
So once you make that decision to play a female character, you suddenly need things to be

523
00:28:54,175 --> 00:28:57,276
said differently about your character than they would be if you were playing a male character.

524
00:28:58,997 --> 00:29:00,678
So as an example...

525
00:29:01,791 --> 00:29:07,796
Here is French, so the English term guardian. In French, you've got le and you've got la.

526
00:29:08,096 --> 00:29:11,439
There's no gender neutral way to refer to a guardian. You're either a male guardian

527
00:29:11,619 --> 00:29:17,464
or you're a female guardian. Same thing with class names. You've got hunters, chasseurs

528
00:29:17,524 --> 00:29:23,709
or chasseuses. So we basically are presented with a choice. We can either stick our head

529
00:29:23,729 --> 00:29:28,432
in the sand here and just ignore that this problem even exists and just refer to everyone

530
00:29:28,473 --> 00:29:30,995
as a dude. Or we can...

531
00:29:32,496 --> 00:29:35,358
to actually support and affirm the choice that we've allowed players to make.

532
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,980
And that sounded more difficult, so we went with that.

533
00:29:40,422 --> 00:29:42,383
So here's a quick example in Italian.

534
00:29:49,048 --> 00:29:52,030
Probably a little bit subtle and hard to pick up if you don't speak Italian, but

535
00:29:52,451 --> 00:29:54,932
Italian, the male version of guardian is guardianno,

536
00:29:55,353 --> 00:29:57,354
and the female version is guardianna.

537
00:29:58,195 --> 00:30:00,096
Depending on which gender character you're playing.

538
00:30:00,907 --> 00:30:03,989
the other NPCs in the tower will actually address you with the correct gender.

539
00:30:05,911 --> 00:30:09,953
So in terms of implementation, how we went about doing that, there's better and worse

540
00:30:09,993 --> 00:30:10,634
ways to do it.

541
00:30:10,954 --> 00:30:14,336
We wanted to do it in a way that wouldn't have huge memory impacts.

542
00:30:14,356 --> 00:30:18,139
We didn't want to do anything dumb like just duplicate the set of lines that are used for

543
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:22,302
male players to female, and if one of them needed to be different, put a different wave

544
00:30:22,322 --> 00:30:22,782
file in.

545
00:30:23,062 --> 00:30:24,383
That would waste a lot of space.

546
00:30:25,003 --> 00:30:29,186
So for actual implementation, what we did was, we have dialogue sequences in our game.

547
00:30:29,955 --> 00:30:35,017
So for a given dialogue sequence, we look through each language, and for any line in

548
00:30:35,057 --> 00:30:39,979
that sequence, if even one language needs a female version of a line, we create a branch

549
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:40,259
node.

550
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:43,200
So that line of dialogue will branch for male and female.

551
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:48,901
So if you're looking at this example here, English, we generally don't use this.

552
00:30:48,941 --> 00:30:53,043
So the English dialogue sequence, it has a branch for male and female on the second line.

553
00:30:53,686 --> 00:30:55,808
but it doesn't actually use that.

554
00:30:55,848 --> 00:30:56,829
It's the same as the male line.

555
00:30:56,969 --> 00:30:58,750
For the French dialogue sequence, it does.

556
00:30:58,991 --> 00:31:01,793
So on the English one, all it does on the male,

557
00:31:01,933 --> 00:31:04,455
or I'm sorry, the female node is just point to the male line.

558
00:31:04,976 --> 00:31:06,077
So there's not a duplicate,

559
00:31:06,277 --> 00:31:10,961
it's just referencing the other dialogue event.

560
00:31:12,102 --> 00:31:13,003
And then for the other lines

561
00:31:13,063 --> 00:31:14,504
where there were no female versions,

562
00:31:14,784 --> 00:31:17,947
you just have a single node, a single line of dialogue.

563
00:31:19,028 --> 00:31:20,529
And then at runtime, we filter based on.

564
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:23,542
the cause of the trigger of that dialogue event,

565
00:31:23,623 --> 00:31:25,364
which is generally the player's character.

566
00:31:25,444 --> 00:31:27,045
So we look at the gender of the cause

567
00:31:27,626 --> 00:31:28,727
and play the correct line.

568
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:30,348
So a lot of games don't do this.

569
00:31:30,548 --> 00:31:32,330
Most games actually don't do this.

570
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:34,051
But we thought it was very important

571
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:37,014
because that idea of creating and investing

572
00:31:37,054 --> 00:31:39,156
in your character is fundamental to Destiny.

573
00:31:39,556 --> 00:31:41,518
You put a lot of time into building that character.

574
00:31:42,238 --> 00:31:43,940
And actually, I talk to a lot of people.

575
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,462
I talk to a lot of gamer friends,

576
00:31:47,323 --> 00:31:48,063
European friends.

577
00:31:49,076 --> 00:31:52,178
translators and whatnot about their own feelings.

578
00:31:52,258 --> 00:31:54,359
And the thing that I just kept hearing over and over again

579
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:57,201
was, yeah, most games don't do this,

580
00:31:57,961 --> 00:32:00,702
but whenever I play a game and I choose a female character

581
00:32:00,743 --> 00:32:03,104
and it actually respects that, I just think it's so awesome.

582
00:32:03,284 --> 00:32:04,204
And we want it to be awesome.

583
00:32:07,166 --> 00:32:10,168
So we've supported this throughout our entire game

584
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:11,188
in the dialogue system.

585
00:32:11,268 --> 00:32:15,571
So anywhere from random NPC lines to story,

586
00:32:15,631 --> 00:32:16,892
mission dialogue, that sort of thing.

587
00:32:17,386 --> 00:32:19,747
If you're playing a female character, that should actually be respected.

588
00:32:19,787 --> 00:32:21,689
And if it's not, it's a bug and please tell me about it.

589
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:30,014
The other thing that we did, initially in our dialogue system, we had some pretty nasty

590
00:32:30,054 --> 00:32:30,694
restrictions.

591
00:32:30,934 --> 00:32:35,117
Our mission dialogue lines needed to be exactly the same length as English.

592
00:32:36,117 --> 00:32:38,639
Which if you've done any kind of translation, you know is not fun.

593
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:43,902
To make a line in another language match exactly with the language you're translating from.

594
00:32:45,168 --> 00:32:48,790
As a translator, first of all, it's just challenging because naturally the way that you say things

595
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:49,870
is going to be longer or shorter.

596
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,851
So you might have to pad a line with some fluff.

597
00:32:52,291 --> 00:32:53,871
You might have to cut out some information.

598
00:32:55,232 --> 00:32:58,713
You might just need to write a line of dialogue that's pretty awkward or force the actor to

599
00:32:58,753 --> 00:33:01,974
rush through it to fit it in the amount of time because there's no way to cut it down.

600
00:33:02,634 --> 00:33:03,774
But it also adds a lot of cost.

601
00:33:03,874 --> 00:33:06,095
When you go into recording, it's the same problem.

602
00:33:06,215 --> 00:33:10,837
The actor in a normal recording session can just read a line and if it sounds good, you

603
00:33:10,877 --> 00:33:11,217
move on.

604
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:14,078
You're trying to match length of another language.

605
00:33:14,572 --> 00:33:18,774
you have to repeat it and repeat it and repeat it and try to get it to work.

606
00:33:18,934 --> 00:33:21,775
And when it doesn't work, then you might have to have someone rewrite it on the fly.

607
00:33:22,435 --> 00:33:25,876
Or you know, add some padding in or try to stretch it out and see if it doesn't sound

608
00:33:25,916 --> 00:33:29,277
too weird when you do that, you know, with audio processing.

609
00:33:30,677 --> 00:33:31,658
So we fixed that.

610
00:33:31,838 --> 00:33:34,939
We decided that was not a restriction we wanted to put in place.

611
00:33:34,999 --> 00:33:38,740
So our mission dialogue can now be free length.

612
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:43,281
The only dialogue actually in the game that needs to match English was our cinematic dialogue

613
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:43,562
because

614
00:33:43,985 --> 00:33:47,147
There's motion capture and you need to match the actual things that are happening on screen.

615
00:33:47,187 --> 00:33:48,727
So there's a little bit of restriction there.

616
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:52,009
But we were able to get rid of the rest.

617
00:33:52,709 --> 00:33:56,651
The other thing that we put a lot of effort into was making sure that the UI supported

618
00:33:56,691 --> 00:33:57,851
what we need for localization.

619
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:05,374
So we actually did a lot of early work, throwaway translation, just so that we could get real

620
00:34:05,494 --> 00:34:07,055
text in the game in all languages.

621
00:34:07,623 --> 00:34:10,244
and test out every part of the UI.

622
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:15,146
So we just took a file or two here and there for each portion of the UI, got it translated

623
00:34:15,206 --> 00:34:17,127
and started looking at what worked and what didn't.

624
00:34:17,987 --> 00:34:21,629
And some of the things that we noticed very early on were there weren't enough space for

625
00:34:21,689 --> 00:34:22,169
item names.

626
00:34:23,289 --> 00:34:27,431
Our UI, if you can see in the little purple box there, it capitalizes all item names,

627
00:34:27,491 --> 00:34:30,852
which makes the text wider, which means you have less space to begin with.

628
00:34:32,423 --> 00:34:36,890
A lot of our item names in the game use compound words or possessives or things, so when you

629
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:41,997
have something like Dust Walker Boots and translate that into French, where you can't

630
00:34:42,057 --> 00:34:44,000
use compound words, it turns into something like

631
00:34:44,527 --> 00:34:47,988
boots of the walker of the dust or something like that, which gets really long.

632
00:34:48,548 --> 00:34:52,029
So what we realized was we could probably find a way to make that work for Destiny.

633
00:34:52,129 --> 00:34:55,650
We could just call them dust boots in French or walker boots in French.

634
00:34:56,711 --> 00:34:58,311
But this isn't just one game.

635
00:34:58,351 --> 00:35:01,372
This is an IP that we wanted to span a decade or more.

636
00:35:01,472 --> 00:35:07,774
So we had to think long term and that wasn't a situation we wanted to get ourselves into.

637
00:35:07,914 --> 00:35:09,794
We wanted to make sure that we were doing things right.

638
00:35:11,069 --> 00:35:15,411
So we expanded it so that the UI will just automatically resize and we can go up to a

639
00:35:15,851 --> 00:35:17,812
second line for localization languages.

640
00:35:18,372 --> 00:35:20,494
And we did that in most places in the UI.

641
00:35:20,574 --> 00:35:25,016
If you look at the tool tips there, anywhere the text gets longer in another language,

642
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,177
it automatically resizes.

643
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:27,597
We implemented font scaling.

644
00:35:28,018 --> 00:35:34,001
So if we have to, we generally try to avoid it because it's not as pretty.

645
00:35:34,506 --> 00:35:40,550
But if the text is just too long to fit, it'll scale down a pixel or two so that you can

646
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:41,351
actually squeeze it in.

647
00:35:44,793 --> 00:35:47,234
Yeah, scaling everything essentially in the UI.

648
00:35:52,178 --> 00:35:54,980
And the next part I want to touch on a little bit, like I mentioned at the beginning, was

649
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:57,121
our approach to web and mobile localization.

650
00:35:58,802 --> 00:36:00,663
When I came into Bungie, we had an English-only website.

651
00:36:01,044 --> 00:36:05,646
There was a new website in development that rolled out shortly thereafter, which had locales

652
00:36:05,666 --> 00:36:06,247
built into it.

653
00:36:06,287 --> 00:36:11,630
It was intended to be localized, but naturally had never been localized or tested in any

654
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:11,810
way.

655
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:15,932
So we had to think about how we wanted to implement localization for the website and

656
00:36:15,992 --> 00:36:16,512
get it working.

657
00:36:19,033 --> 00:36:22,895
So challenges that we had, things that we were thinking about when we sat down to spec

658
00:36:22,955 --> 00:36:27,037
out how it would work was we knew we were always going to be lagging behind English

659
00:36:27,077 --> 00:36:28,398
a little bit in terms of translation.

660
00:36:28,438 --> 00:36:29,659
It's always going to take time.

661
00:36:31,502 --> 00:36:37,604
Our community and marketing team tends to post very timely information.

662
00:36:39,204 --> 00:36:41,445
They move very quickly, so things are always coming in pretty hot.

663
00:36:42,165 --> 00:36:46,207
And we knew it would never be possible to keep up with things in six other languages

664
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:47,147
on the same timeline.

665
00:36:47,507 --> 00:36:51,228
So we wanted a system that would be flexible, where we could get stuff out as soon as it

666
00:36:51,268 --> 00:36:55,650
was possible, but still make sure that people were having a good experience without that.

667
00:36:58,068 --> 00:37:01,689
The other problem was that we had no real tools support at all.

668
00:37:01,789 --> 00:37:06,030
We had a content publishing system that was designed to create English content and post

669
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:08,751
it to the web, but there was no concept of localization in there.

670
00:37:10,531 --> 00:37:14,432
When an item got updated, if you went in and updated it in English, we had no way to know

671
00:37:14,492 --> 00:37:15,292
that that had happened.

672
00:37:15,332 --> 00:37:19,293
We had no way to track what had been translated in the system and what hadn't been translated.

673
00:37:21,414 --> 00:37:27,195
And we also have, essentially, not all of the game strings, but most of the text in

674
00:37:27,215 --> 00:37:27,515
the game.

675
00:37:28,266 --> 00:37:57,295
Also used for web and mobile. If you've used the destiny companion at all, you can look at your character so you can see items and their names and the flavor text. You can look at missions and their descriptions and all that kind of stuff. So the bulk of the text from the game is also used for web and mobile. That fortunately turned out not to be an issue for localization just because of the way it was set up to begin with. Our website pulls that content from a build of the game. So whenever we update the game with a patch or something, we

676
00:37:58,017 --> 00:38:01,480
have a new content build that contains the text that the website can then use.

677
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,783
So that's something that we didn't have to worry about at all for localization, thankfully.

678
00:38:05,744 --> 00:38:09,687
Because if we didn't have that, you get in a situation where you have two sets of duplicate

679
00:38:09,707 --> 00:38:12,969
content over here and over here, and it's very easy for something to get updated and

680
00:38:13,009 --> 00:38:15,471
changed and to forget to go back and do it on the other one.

681
00:38:18,574 --> 00:38:23,258
So how we solved the big problem there with our content publishing system was, first of

682
00:38:23,318 --> 00:38:24,999
all, to implement localization queues.

683
00:38:25,379 --> 00:38:27,361
So any time that a particular piece of content

684
00:38:27,762 --> 00:38:31,943
got updated or created in English, it would go into the queue for each of the other languages.

685
00:38:32,263 --> 00:38:36,685
So each language had its own queue that could work at its own pace, go through and translate

686
00:38:36,765 --> 00:38:39,846
items, submit them, push them out onto the web.

687
00:38:40,906 --> 00:38:45,548
Within that, I mean, we've iterated on this for a couple of years now, so it's gained

688
00:38:45,568 --> 00:38:49,509
a lot of functionality, but within each of those queues, we now also have priority queues.

689
00:38:49,989 --> 00:38:51,790
So five different levels of priority where

690
00:38:52,348 --> 00:38:57,650
If I'm going in and writing a piece of content in English, I can decide for myself basically

691
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,570
the priority that I think should be assigned to this.

692
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:03,672
I think this is super urgent and critical information to get out, so I'll mark it as

693
00:39:03,752 --> 00:39:04,632
priority number one.

694
00:39:05,112 --> 00:39:09,193
Or this is something that, yeah, get to it when you have time, but it's not super critical.

695
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:12,194
It's just a minor update, so maybe that's like a priority four.

696
00:39:13,294 --> 00:39:16,795
And within each of those cues, then, an individual translator can go in and reassign.

697
00:39:17,752 --> 00:39:21,614
If French has a huge backlog and a lot of things that are all set to priority one, you

698
00:39:21,634 --> 00:39:25,276
could go through and say, well, yeah, these are all important, but, you know, these ones

699
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:28,198
are more important, so I'll put these other ones in a lower priority queue.

700
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:33,681
And the other thing that you can do whenever you're updating an item is add a note, a sort

701
00:39:33,701 --> 00:39:34,622
of revision history.

702
00:39:34,702 --> 00:39:38,584
So if I go in and update the English item three times and then the Italian translator

703
00:39:38,624 --> 00:39:43,708
goes in to update his, he'll see the comments that I put in and see what has changed since

704
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:44,388
the last update.

705
00:39:44,768 --> 00:39:45,329
And we also added.

706
00:39:46,389 --> 00:39:50,791
import and export functionality to work with computer-assisted translation tools so that

707
00:39:50,811 --> 00:39:54,433
we have the benefits of translation memory when we're doing this stuff, too.

708
00:39:57,895 --> 00:40:04,178
So the fundamental philosophy that we tried to apply when we were thinking about the localization

709
00:40:04,198 --> 00:40:08,961
of the site was that we wanted anyone who went to the site for the first time in, say,

710
00:40:09,001 --> 00:40:09,241
French.

711
00:40:09,892 --> 00:40:13,214
to experience a website that was fully localized in French.

712
00:40:13,734 --> 00:40:15,955
If you go to a lot of websites that are localized,

713
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:18,536
you'll see a little flag at the top and you'll click on it.

714
00:40:19,377 --> 00:40:21,238
And maybe you click the French flag

715
00:40:21,458 --> 00:40:22,958
and like three words change to French

716
00:40:23,179 --> 00:40:24,559
and the rest of the website's still in English.

717
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:27,280
And I don't like that, it's a big pet peeve of mine.

718
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:30,242
So what I wanted was the best localized experience

719
00:40:30,262 --> 00:40:31,522
that we could provide by default.

720
00:40:32,383 --> 00:40:33,443
But what we also wanted to do

721
00:40:34,584 --> 00:40:36,105
was make it so that people had the option

722
00:40:36,165 --> 00:40:37,425
if they speak English or

723
00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:42,271
Maybe they don't speak English, but they just want to see, like, you know, there are fans

724
00:40:42,291 --> 00:40:45,111
who might want to see a trailer the moment it comes out, even if it's not available in

725
00:40:45,131 --> 00:40:45,752
their language yet.

726
00:40:46,232 --> 00:40:51,373
We wanted to give people the ability to see the untranslated content too, if they so desired.

727
00:40:52,274 --> 00:40:56,275
But understanding that the vast majority of our customers don't speak multiple languages,

728
00:40:56,395 --> 00:41:02,277
so we don't want to just flood them with English content when they most likely don't speak

729
00:41:02,297 --> 00:41:04,458
it because they've actively selected a different language.

730
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:12,151
So our solution to that problem was to implement English fallback settings. So each individual

731
00:41:12,191 --> 00:41:16,392
piece of content in our content system has a property of whether or not it should fall

732
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:20,834
back to English if there's no localization available. So we have that on individual things

733
00:41:21,294 --> 00:41:26,415
like news articles, but we also have it on content sets, which are another content item

734
00:41:26,435 --> 00:41:31,497
which is basically a container of other items. So using that, we're able to do some kind

735
00:41:31,517 --> 00:41:32,357
of interesting things.

736
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:37,762
each user's account settings, they have an option they can check to say, I want to see

737
00:41:37,822 --> 00:41:40,123
content in English if it's not translated yet.

738
00:41:40,683 --> 00:41:45,165
So between those things, we're able to do some kind of powerful and interesting things.

739
00:41:47,586 --> 00:41:48,406
So here's one example.

740
00:41:48,967 --> 00:41:53,128
Until very recently, our website had this top news set on it where there would be the

741
00:41:53,208 --> 00:41:55,609
three spotlight news items we wanted to show to people.

742
00:41:56,810 --> 00:41:58,451
The iOS and Android apps still use this.

743
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:02,092
So for this one, we would make the content set.

744
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:06,443
not fall back to English. Because we would never want to be in a situation, for example,

745
00:42:06,483 --> 00:42:12,126
where we posted a new weekly update in English and it wasn't translated yet, but we decided

746
00:42:12,166 --> 00:42:15,068
to go ahead and throw that on the front page for English. We wouldn't want that to show

747
00:42:15,108 --> 00:42:19,510
up in other languages because it wasn't translated. So this is one where we curate the content.

748
00:42:20,191 --> 00:42:24,553
We don't fall back to English. An individual translator can go in his or her language and

749
00:42:24,593 --> 00:42:28,115
say, these are the three things that I want to display in my language. These are the three

750
00:42:28,535 --> 00:42:31,597
most recent, most relevant articles that are available in my language.

751
00:42:34,876 --> 00:42:38,119
Then the other pattern that we use is this one.

752
00:42:38,359 --> 00:42:40,821
This is what we use, for example, on our help site

753
00:42:40,921 --> 00:42:42,742
where we have a set of the trending help articles.

754
00:42:42,802 --> 00:42:48,027
So the most generally useful or relevant things for users.

755
00:42:48,867 --> 00:42:50,529
Maybe something happens in the middle of the night

756
00:42:50,629 --> 00:42:52,450
and we need to post information for people.

757
00:42:52,751 --> 00:42:55,413
This is one where, A, it changes pretty frequently.

758
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:59,396
So on the localization side due to staffing,

759
00:42:59,416 --> 00:43:01,978
which I'll get into later, we don't wanna be responsible

760
00:43:02,018 --> 00:43:03,680
for having to update this all the time.

761
00:43:04,245 --> 00:43:10,547
But also, in general, at least for help information, I think it's better to give that to people

762
00:43:10,587 --> 00:43:14,588
even if it's not translated yet. If there's something critical that's going on, I think

763
00:43:14,628 --> 00:43:18,189
being able to get that information and at least, like, Google translate it. I just said

764
00:43:18,229 --> 00:43:23,250
a dirty word, but I think that's better than nothing. So for this one, we've made the active

765
00:43:23,291 --> 00:43:27,452
choice that this one will fall back to English. So the set of items that's displayed is always

766
00:43:27,492 --> 00:43:32,173
the set of items that's displayed for English. But there are situations where we want to

767
00:43:32,213 --> 00:43:32,873
remove some of them.

768
00:43:33,405 --> 00:43:37,807
So for example, our game is only available on Sony platforms in Japan.

769
00:43:38,307 --> 00:43:42,849
So on the Japanese version of the website, if there's a help article about Xbox, it doesn't

770
00:43:42,869 --> 00:43:43,669
make sense to show that.

771
00:43:43,909 --> 00:43:46,110
So we mark that one not to fall back to English.

772
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:48,331
Don't localize it for Japanese and it disappears.

773
00:43:51,012 --> 00:43:52,213
So quick example of that.

774
00:43:54,714 --> 00:43:57,455
This is a snapshot of our website from last month.

775
00:43:57,975 --> 00:44:01,497
So here we've got a weekly update that was posted on February 12th.

776
00:44:02,698 --> 00:44:03,218
And beneath that...

777
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:07,202
There is a content set of calendar events that are upcoming.

778
00:44:07,802 --> 00:44:09,323
So it looks like five of them for English.

779
00:44:11,945 --> 00:44:16,588
When you look at the website in German now, we have the spotlight item being the weekly

780
00:44:16,628 --> 00:44:17,509
update from the week before.

781
00:44:17,929 --> 00:44:19,150
So the English one was just posted.

782
00:44:19,330 --> 00:44:20,811
It hasn't been translated into German yet.

783
00:44:21,131 --> 00:44:23,692
So it just shows the most recent one that we do have for that language.

784
00:44:24,313 --> 00:44:28,275
The calendar set beneath it also, there is one item that had just been added, hadn't

785
00:44:28,295 --> 00:44:29,436
been localized into German yet.

786
00:44:29,516 --> 00:44:30,977
So that one isn't displayed.

787
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:36,763
But it's okay. As a user going to the German site, nothing seems wrong. Unless you actively

788
00:44:36,803 --> 00:44:40,685
go to English and see that there's something different, you're getting the most recent

789
00:44:40,705 --> 00:44:47,709
information that's available in your language. But if you are a user who speaks both German

790
00:44:47,749 --> 00:44:50,951
and English and you've set your account to show you that content, this is the view that

791
00:44:50,991 --> 00:44:56,633
you'd get. So because there is a more recent article that hasn't been translated, suddenly

792
00:44:56,734 --> 00:44:58,795
the spotlight news item becomes that one in English.

793
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:03,737
The calendar shows you all of the events that are translated in German, but the one that

794
00:45:03,777 --> 00:45:05,357
was not translated yet also shows up.

795
00:45:11,199 --> 00:45:15,780
So part of the reason that we did things this way was because of the situation we have for

796
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:16,120
staffing.

797
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:17,620
So I want to talk a little bit about that.

798
00:45:18,361 --> 00:45:22,562
So I'm going to take you on a journey into the distant past, 2012 to be exact.

799
00:45:23,622 --> 00:45:27,423
So in 2012, Bungie had no localization staff at all.

800
00:45:27,783 --> 00:45:29,263
We had an English only website.

801
00:45:29,758 --> 00:45:34,100
mobile apps. We had games that were only coming out on a single console. So things were simpler

802
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:41,623
then. Today we've got a fully staffed localization team. We have a game that we're supporting

803
00:45:41,923 --> 00:45:46,565
that's a live game with frequent, you know, patches and releases and things like that.

804
00:45:46,625 --> 00:45:52,028
We have apps in seven languages and those are the website and the mobile apps have two

805
00:45:52,068 --> 00:45:57,610
weeks sprint release cycles where we're constantly updating them. So all together, it says seven

806
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:58,711
languages and platforms up there.

807
00:45:59,914 --> 00:46:04,617
for consoles and then we're also supporting web, iOS and Android. So seven separate platforms

808
00:46:04,657 --> 00:46:06,499
that we're supporting for localization all together.

809
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:13,084
So I want to talk a little bit about how we went about doing that in terms of staffing.

810
00:46:14,545 --> 00:46:19,889
So for Destiny we used basically a hybrid staffing model. We had me, internal localization

811
00:46:19,929 --> 00:46:27,115
manager. We had external translators that were in country working externally. We had

812
00:46:27,255 --> 00:46:28,937
a internal localization editor.

813
00:46:29,435 --> 00:46:30,776
working at Bungie, one per language.

814
00:46:32,217 --> 00:46:33,878
And we had internal testers also at Bungie,

815
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:34,518
one per language.

816
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:38,760
And one per language is pretty small.

817
00:46:39,461 --> 00:46:41,982
But like I said, we were able to start early

818
00:46:42,022 --> 00:46:43,463
and do a lot of early iteration

819
00:46:43,863 --> 00:46:44,804
that made it so essentially

820
00:46:44,844 --> 00:46:46,065
when we got to the end of the project,

821
00:46:46,505 --> 00:46:47,745
there weren't a lot of things to fix.

822
00:46:48,246 --> 00:46:50,467
So things like getting that translation in early

823
00:46:50,527 --> 00:46:51,928
and fixing the problems in the UI

824
00:46:52,408 --> 00:46:53,749
meant when we got to localization,

825
00:46:54,129 --> 00:46:55,210
almost all the problems that we had

826
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:56,931
were things we could fix in translation.

827
00:46:56,991 --> 00:46:58,772
We didn't have to ask for features and support.

828
00:46:59,457 --> 00:47:00,097
for that sort of thing.

829
00:47:00,117 --> 00:47:03,780
We were able to get in at a stage where it was still early enough to solve the problems.

830
00:47:07,422 --> 00:47:08,463
So localization editors.

831
00:47:08,903 --> 00:47:11,945
This was an idea that was already in place before I joined Bungie.

832
00:47:12,466 --> 00:47:16,909
But the basic idea would be to have someone who would be the main tester for that language

833
00:47:17,189 --> 00:47:18,910
but was also capable of doing translation.

834
00:47:19,291 --> 00:47:22,493
So when we got to the end of the project, if we needed very quick turnaround on things,

835
00:47:22,533 --> 00:47:24,434
we would have someone in-house who could do that translation.

836
00:47:26,037 --> 00:47:27,778
hearing stories from the past at Bungie.

837
00:47:28,158 --> 00:47:33,499
One of the problems for them in terms of localization had always been not being able to turn things

838
00:47:33,539 --> 00:47:34,279
around quickly enough.

839
00:47:34,419 --> 00:47:40,580
Because Bungie is a company that likes to iterate and do things, if there's even a little

840
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,681
bit of time left where they can make something better, they want to.

841
00:47:43,081 --> 00:47:45,921
So very often at the end of the project, there are changes going in.

842
00:47:46,642 --> 00:47:49,222
Something something Jason Jones, something something.

843
00:47:50,475 --> 00:47:56,617
pistols or something. Anyway, things go in where we need quick turnaround and if we don't

844
00:47:56,637 --> 00:48:03,500
have the ability to do it, we can't make improvements to the game or we can't fix a bug. So that

845
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:08,662
was the basic idea. That's not actually how it worked out. We've ended up using our localization

846
00:48:08,722 --> 00:48:13,784
editors for a lot of things. So we have them doing all of our web and mobile translation.

847
00:48:13,944 --> 00:48:15,165
So all of that is done internally.

848
00:48:16,107 --> 00:48:20,570
The actual builds of the website and the apps but also all of the content that gets published

849
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:21,791
is done by that person.

850
00:48:23,032 --> 00:48:29,156
We have the ability to, like I've talked about, work on things before they're really ready

851
00:48:29,196 --> 00:48:29,936
for localization.

852
00:48:30,056 --> 00:48:34,419
So being able to go in and do that early translation meant we were able to make changes to the

853
00:48:34,499 --> 00:48:36,401
UI while the UI was still being developed.

854
00:48:36,741 --> 00:48:40,403
So rather than having to make people go back and repeat work, we were just able to identify

855
00:48:40,423 --> 00:48:40,463
it.

856
00:48:40,807 --> 00:48:45,071
problems for localization and make sure that the UI, the final UI when it was implemented

857
00:48:45,391 --> 00:48:46,132
supported those things.

858
00:48:48,795 --> 00:48:52,618
We also have done all of the game translation up to at least the capacity of our team.

859
00:48:52,678 --> 00:48:59,665
So almost for the past year, not quite a year now, but most of the past year we've supported

860
00:48:59,785 --> 00:49:01,486
all the game translation internally too.

861
00:49:01,566 --> 00:49:04,409
So after we did the bulk of the translation on Destiny.

862
00:49:05,242 --> 00:49:10,705
We took back ownership of the text in-house. We closed out the game. We've done all of the feature work for patches.

863
00:49:11,425 --> 00:49:15,107
Our first expansion that came out last year, we translated in-house.

864
00:49:15,867 --> 00:49:19,189
And at least so far, we've been able to keep up with everything internally.

865
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:25,392
We've also been able to use localization editors to do all of our testing between the major releases.

866
00:49:25,472 --> 00:49:31,756
So again, being a live game with patches, there are things that are constantly being added that require a little bit of translation.

867
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:37,632
A little feature here that has some text associated with it or a bug fix over here that needs

868
00:49:37,972 --> 00:49:39,512
something changed in all languages.

869
00:49:40,273 --> 00:49:41,973
So there's not a lot of test work.

870
00:49:42,353 --> 00:49:46,895
It doesn't really justify keeping a full-time test team for localization all the time.

871
00:49:47,495 --> 00:49:52,797
But having those people who speak the languages in-house means that we're able to still do

872
00:49:52,857 --> 00:49:53,477
that internally.

873
00:49:55,677 --> 00:49:59,319
And finally, and probably one of the most important things, is that they review and

874
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:00,779
edit everything that's done externally.

875
00:50:01,293 --> 00:50:03,294
So we essentially have a single funnel point

876
00:50:03,735 --> 00:50:06,776
where everything flows through for each language.

877
00:50:06,856 --> 00:50:08,637
So there's someone who is ensuring

878
00:50:08,677 --> 00:50:10,238
that the translation is consistent,

879
00:50:10,278 --> 00:50:11,318
the quality's consistent.

880
00:50:11,859 --> 00:50:13,059
If something's done externally,

881
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:15,440
you might have something that references,

882
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,221
for example, a line of dialogue in the game.

883
00:50:17,601 --> 00:50:19,922
And a translator who hasn't worked on the game

884
00:50:19,962 --> 00:50:20,863
might not realize that.

885
00:50:20,923 --> 00:50:22,504
So they translate it a little differently

886
00:50:22,544 --> 00:50:23,804
than it actually appears in the game.

887
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:25,105
Having people in house means

888
00:50:25,145 --> 00:50:26,366
that they'll catch that sort of thing

889
00:50:26,406 --> 00:50:28,126
and actually be able to preserve those references,

890
00:50:28,286 --> 00:50:29,027
keep up the quality.

891
00:50:30,636 --> 00:50:32,737
because they're intimately familiar with the game and with Bungie.

892
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:38,721
So benefits of having an internal team.

893
00:50:39,501 --> 00:50:42,723
One of the biggest ones and the reason that Bungie wanted localization editors

894
00:50:42,743 --> 00:50:43,964
to begin with is agility.

895
00:50:44,384 --> 00:50:45,785
It means that we can do things very quickly.

896
00:50:46,225 --> 00:50:48,307
If someone comes up with an idea in the afternoon,

897
00:50:49,047 --> 00:50:50,708
generally nine times out of ten we can get

898
00:50:51,388 --> 00:50:52,809
it done in all languages the same day.

899
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:56,592
Obviously sometimes people are sick or on vacation or whatever, but most of the

900
00:50:56,612 --> 00:50:58,653
time we're able to turn things around very, very quickly.

901
00:51:01,922 --> 00:51:07,324
Another one is security. Bungie is a company who is very, very tight on security and does

902
00:51:07,364 --> 00:51:11,566
not do things like send builds outside of the building. If you work in localization,

903
00:51:12,246 --> 00:51:15,827
you can probably imagine not having access to the game that you're translating makes

904
00:51:15,847 --> 00:51:21,129
things very challenging. We on Destiny, we flew over the external translators for a week

905
00:51:21,209 --> 00:51:23,790
to play through everything and get familiar with the game so they

906
00:51:24,217 --> 00:51:25,497
at least had a sense of what they were doing.

907
00:51:25,918 --> 00:51:30,379
But having that person in-house then who can check everything that comes in and communicate

908
00:51:30,399 --> 00:51:35,660
information, recognize where people are misinterpreting things and provide more context to the translators

909
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:36,900
is very, very valuable.

910
00:51:41,021 --> 00:51:43,921
And finally, quality, which is, I mean, what all that kind of comes back to.

911
00:51:43,961 --> 00:51:47,702
Having that single person who has a vested interest in making things better.

912
00:51:48,543 --> 00:51:49,864
And no conflict of interest either.

913
00:51:50,004 --> 00:51:51,605
When you're working with external translators,

914
00:51:51,625 --> 00:51:53,086
I mean external translators are great too,

915
00:51:53,146 --> 00:51:54,967
and I haven't met one ever who isn't passionate

916
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:58,850
about what they do, but they're kind of in the position

917
00:51:58,890 --> 00:52:01,612
of being forced to do what they think you want,

918
00:52:01,752 --> 00:52:04,193
which is generally translate things very quickly

919
00:52:04,233 --> 00:52:05,954
and don't ask too many questions and send it back.

920
00:52:06,295 --> 00:52:07,455
Whereas if you have someone internal,

921
00:52:07,796 --> 00:52:10,037
they will actually point out when you do the things

922
00:52:10,077 --> 00:52:11,518
that you shouldn't be doing, and they will fight

923
00:52:11,558 --> 00:52:12,819
for the things that should be fought for.

924
00:52:13,712 --> 00:52:17,355
It's a person who will be very steeped in the game

925
00:52:17,575 --> 00:52:20,357
and care about it and ensure that the quality

926
00:52:20,377 --> 00:52:21,938
of everything that's done for it stays high.

927
00:52:21,998 --> 00:52:23,399
So that's another big gain.

928
00:52:26,462 --> 00:52:28,964
So the other thing that I've been asked to remind you

929
00:52:29,805 --> 00:52:31,966
is there are evaluations that'll be sent to you

930
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:34,408
after this talk, so please, they're electronic,

931
00:52:34,428 --> 00:52:36,650
so check your spam folder and be sure to fill those out.

932
00:52:37,111 --> 00:52:38,352
And also, Bungie is hiring.

933
00:52:38,492 --> 00:52:39,653
We are hiring for localization.

934
00:52:39,693 --> 00:52:41,754
We're hiring for many, many disciplines.

935
00:52:42,531 --> 00:52:44,852
And one of our recruiters, I actually spy in the back of the room.

936
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:48,933
So if you have any interest in coming to work for a really awesome company and doing awesome

937
00:52:48,973 --> 00:52:52,434
things, feel free to come up and talk to me or talk to Jessica in the back.

938
00:52:52,454 --> 00:52:54,075
She'll be happy to give you more information.

939
00:52:54,775 --> 00:52:55,295
Thank you very much.

940
00:52:55,315 --> 00:53:06,179
I think we have about seven minutes for questions.

941
00:53:06,219 --> 00:53:08,480
So if anyone has any, feel free to go up.

942
00:53:14,289 --> 00:53:17,791
Give me a quick introduction, your name and who you are.

943
00:53:17,811 --> 00:53:20,633
I'm Jack Ward Fincham, I'm a producer from Europe.

944
00:53:21,753 --> 00:53:26,996
And for anybody who is working in localization, I worked in localization for years before

945
00:53:27,036 --> 00:53:29,677
living in a country that wasn't localized to my needs.

946
00:53:30,017 --> 00:53:33,359
And it taught me a hell of a lot about what I should expect out of localization.

947
00:53:33,379 --> 00:53:33,859
That was great.

948
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:35,340
I've got a question.

949
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:39,762
You support seven languages, two of which were a form of Chinese and Japanese.

950
00:53:39,783 --> 00:53:40,343
Is that correct?

951
00:53:40,812 --> 00:53:45,213
So the question is what languages we support. We support English, French, Italian, German,

952
00:53:45,253 --> 00:53:52,476
Spanish, Brazilian, Portuguese and Japanese. So within Japanese particularly there are

953
00:53:53,076 --> 00:53:58,638
obviously nearly 10,000 individual characters. All of which you probably don't want to load

954
00:53:58,678 --> 00:54:05,641
into memory in your phone, lest kill it. So what techniques did your team use to minimize

955
00:54:05,661 --> 00:54:07,702
the memory footprint of your localization process?

956
00:54:08,033 --> 00:54:12,976
That would be a better question for UI engineer. I want to say that it actually turned out

957
00:54:13,016 --> 00:54:16,498
not to be a problem this time. I know in the past when I've talked to them about that on

958
00:54:16,538 --> 00:54:20,640
past titles they've done things like actually scan the strings in the game and see what

959
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:25,322
glyphs are actually used and only put those into the font set to conserve memory. I want

960
00:54:25,342 --> 00:54:29,224
to say that we were able to have the whole Japanese font in memory but you would have

961
00:54:29,244 --> 00:54:31,946
to ask someone who is not me because I don't actually do the coding.

962
00:54:36,086 --> 00:54:37,426
Hi, my name is Juan Pablo.

963
00:54:37,486 --> 00:54:39,267
I work in Cartoon Network Latin America.

964
00:54:39,767 --> 00:54:41,047
First, I want to thank you for the talk

965
00:54:41,127 --> 00:54:43,548
and congratulate you guys on a job amazingly well done.

966
00:54:43,568 --> 00:54:44,508
Thank you.

967
00:54:44,808 --> 00:54:47,409
It's so good, actually, that Zur is a dick in any language.

968
00:54:48,029 --> 00:54:48,549
So good job.

969
00:54:49,469 --> 00:54:51,389
But one thing that I thought was really interesting,

970
00:54:51,530 --> 00:54:54,670
do these localization, how do you call them, editors?

971
00:54:54,690 --> 00:54:55,210
Editors, yeah.

972
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:58,571
Had access to the main development team, especially

973
00:54:58,651 --> 00:55:00,632
the writers, because I noticed in the Spanish,

974
00:55:00,692 --> 00:55:02,192
at least the Spanish localization,

975
00:55:02,912 --> 00:55:04,092
it's really, really very good.

976
00:55:04,312 --> 00:55:05,393
And there's a lot of things that.

977
00:55:06,313 --> 00:55:10,934
were adapted, not necessarily as literal as they could be,

978
00:55:11,174 --> 00:55:13,055
but it really makes sense in the concept of a game.

979
00:55:13,075 --> 00:55:16,115
So I was wondering if they actually did interact with it.

980
00:55:16,175 --> 00:55:17,676
Yeah, the external, so the question is,

981
00:55:17,756 --> 00:55:20,196
did our translators have access to the writing team

982
00:55:20,236 --> 00:55:21,797
and to be able to ask questions and things?

983
00:55:22,157 --> 00:55:24,837
The external translators did not accept

984
00:55:24,877 --> 00:55:26,378
that they did have access to us,

985
00:55:26,578 --> 00:55:27,638
who could then ask the writing team.

986
00:55:28,138 --> 00:55:31,159
But Bungie is, I mean, we're essentially a big open.

987
00:55:31,585 --> 00:55:35,706
floor plan studio so everyone can talk to everyone. So yeah, the localization team,

988
00:55:35,746 --> 00:55:40,127
the editors that we have in house go to talk to the writing team all the time. So we have

989
00:55:40,247 --> 00:55:42,548
pretty much free access to anyone, which is really, really nice.

990
00:55:42,828 --> 00:55:46,029
But there wasn't a centralized process to have that happen?

991
00:55:46,189 --> 00:55:49,290
Not a super centralized process. I mean, we did, because we have so many languages, we

992
00:55:49,330 --> 00:55:52,911
didn't want to have six people asking the writers the same questions. So we do things

993
00:55:52,951 --> 00:55:53,051
like

994
00:55:53,505 --> 00:55:57,226
build a spreadsheet where we put the questions in and then once a day or once every couple

995
00:55:57,246 --> 00:55:59,447
of days, send that to the writing team to get answers.

996
00:56:00,027 --> 00:56:01,887
But a lot of stuff just happens organically too.

997
00:56:01,907 --> 00:56:05,068
You run into someone by the coffee machine and have a conversation about something you

998
00:56:05,088 --> 00:56:06,108
were wondering or that sort of thing.

999
00:56:06,128 --> 00:56:06,929
All right.

1000
00:56:07,009 --> 00:56:07,289
Thank you.

1001
00:56:07,369 --> 00:56:07,449
Yeah.

1002
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:07,569
Yeah.

1003
00:56:07,589 --> 00:56:07,629
Oh.

1004
00:56:07,649 --> 00:56:10,750
Sorry, over here.

1005
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:10,850
Yeah.

1006
00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:11,530
Hi, I'm Miguel Forte.

1007
00:56:11,550 --> 00:56:12,410
I work for Capcom.

1008
00:56:12,470 --> 00:56:13,550
I'm the manager of the localization group there.

1009
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:14,010
Oh, hi.

1010
00:56:14,030 --> 00:56:14,130
Yeah.

1011
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:15,331
I'm the manager of the localization group there.

1012
00:56:15,351 --> 00:56:16,511
I'm the manager of the localization group there.

1013
00:56:16,531 --> 00:56:17,771
I'm the manager of the localization group there.

1014
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:18,732
I'm the manager of the localization group there.

1015
00:56:19,439 --> 00:56:21,440
Yeah, a lot of the problems you were highlighting here

1016
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:23,460
are the same things we face every day.

1017
00:56:24,341 --> 00:56:26,922
And we do have an internal team, especially with figs,

1018
00:56:27,022 --> 00:56:28,462
to handle all those problems that arise.

1019
00:56:29,122 --> 00:56:31,223
So my question isn't really localization-based.

1020
00:56:31,283 --> 00:56:33,484
I'm more curious about your source language, English.

1021
00:56:34,464 --> 00:56:36,305
Who's editing the English?

1022
00:56:36,605 --> 00:56:37,885
Who is watching the writers?

1023
00:56:37,905 --> 00:56:39,626
Do you leave that to your QA team?

1024
00:56:40,026 --> 00:56:42,167
What happens when you find mistakes in the English?

1025
00:56:42,227 --> 00:56:44,347
I'm sure your internal localizers

1026
00:56:44,367 --> 00:56:47,208
are very vociferous about finding mistakes in English,

1027
00:56:47,228 --> 00:56:49,029
because it impedes their language.

1028
00:56:49,089 --> 00:56:49,209
So.

1029
00:56:49,598 --> 00:56:51,018
Who handles that over at Bungie?

1030
00:56:51,258 --> 00:56:54,559
Yeah, so the question is who checks the English content?

1031
00:56:55,099 --> 00:56:59,800
And the answer is, we're sort of in the process of changing how that works.

1032
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:03,241
We just hired a copy editor, so we're kind of implementing a new process there.

1033
00:57:03,321 --> 00:57:06,601
But it's always been the case that anyone can report anything.

1034
00:57:06,661 --> 00:57:08,302
So the localization team definitely.

1035
00:57:08,922 --> 00:57:12,843
Translators see every bit of text in the game very closely and have to understand it.

1036
00:57:12,903 --> 00:57:13,603
So like you're saying...

1037
00:57:13,868 --> 00:57:16,810
It's very often translators who find the bugs in English and report them.

1038
00:57:17,270 --> 00:57:17,871
And yeah, they did.

1039
00:57:17,911 --> 00:57:21,273
I mean, we can file, anyone in the studio can file bugs on things, so they would file

1040
00:57:21,293 --> 00:57:24,955
bugs or just give a heads up to the writer that they knew were in, was in charge of that

1041
00:57:25,255 --> 00:57:26,116
particular bit of content.

1042
00:57:30,135 --> 00:57:37,203
Kind of curious what your approach is to localization of some of the legendary and exotic names

1043
00:57:37,243 --> 00:57:41,267
of things like Dr. Nope and The Devil You Know.

1044
00:57:41,688 --> 00:57:47,254
How do you handle that as it's translated into other languages and does that affect

1045
00:57:47,314 --> 00:57:51,338
how you name things in English that might not translate as well?

1046
00:57:51,701 --> 00:57:57,145
No, we don't give them any restrictions in English. English is what English is and we find the

1047
00:57:57,185 --> 00:58:01,928
best way to deal with it in other languages. How do we go about translating things like

1048
00:58:01,988 --> 00:58:09,293
exotics? I hire good people and I basically trust them. So I basically give our editors a lot of

1049
00:58:09,333 --> 00:58:14,436
flexibility to name things in their language the way that they need to to make it good. I mean,

1050
00:58:14,476 --> 00:58:18,258
there's a lot of things like Dr. Nope. It's not going to directly translate but maybe you can

1051
00:58:18,278 --> 00:58:20,100
come up with a similar name that captures that.

1052
00:58:20,453 --> 00:58:26,730
that theme or that idea and works for a French audience. So kind of play it by ear.

1053
00:58:29,596 --> 00:58:29,716
Hi.

1054
00:58:30,096 --> 00:58:30,236
Hi.

1055
00:58:30,517 --> 00:58:31,097
My name's Lauren.

1056
00:58:31,277 --> 00:58:33,539
I am getting my MBA in localization management,

1057
00:58:33,579 --> 00:58:35,520
and I'm a freelance Japanese-English proofreader.

1058
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:37,741
I have two questions.

1059
00:58:37,861 --> 00:58:39,302
One of them is that you said that you

1060
00:58:39,763 --> 00:58:41,164
rely sort of on iconography.

1061
00:58:41,224 --> 00:58:43,485
Do you do any culturalization of that or any checking

1062
00:58:43,525 --> 00:58:45,727
to make sure that the images that you're using

1063
00:58:45,787 --> 00:58:47,188
are appropriate for those markets?

1064
00:58:47,328 --> 00:58:50,370
And also, in terms of your web development and the web

1065
00:58:50,650 --> 00:58:52,711
portals, do you use sort of a global gateway,

1066
00:58:52,751 --> 00:58:54,773
or how do you address people coming

1067
00:58:54,793 --> 00:58:56,213
into that for the first time and being

1068
00:58:56,254 --> 00:58:57,574
able to adjust their language settings?

1069
00:58:58,255 --> 00:59:00,115
So, a couple questions there.

1070
00:59:00,155 --> 00:59:02,136
So the first one is iconography.

1071
00:59:02,196 --> 00:59:06,117
How do we go about making sure that the icons and images we're using are okay for other

1072
00:59:06,137 --> 00:59:06,457
regions?

1073
00:59:06,937 --> 00:59:10,599
We have a geopolitical review process where we send stuff off.

1074
00:59:10,659 --> 00:59:15,840
So all textures in the game, all those assets go off to people to be reviewed for that sort

1075
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:16,100
of thing.

1076
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:18,461
And a lot of that, I mean, because we have...

1077
00:59:19,333 --> 00:59:22,755
Activision as our publishing partners, we have the ability to lean on them for help

1078
00:59:22,795 --> 00:59:23,836
with a lot of stuff like that.

1079
00:59:24,716 --> 00:59:27,498
But yeah, we definitely do reviews because you can get into a lot of trouble with that

1080
00:59:27,518 --> 00:59:27,839
sort of thing.

1081
00:59:28,359 --> 00:59:31,921
And because we don't localize graphics, that is something we have to worry about because

1082
00:59:31,941 --> 00:59:33,282
we can't change it for another language.

1083
00:59:33,943 --> 00:59:35,604
And I'm sorry, the second question was?

1084
00:59:35,624 --> 00:59:36,805
About the web portal.

1085
00:59:36,845 --> 00:59:37,645
The web portal, yeah.

1086
00:59:37,685 --> 00:59:41,468
So I don't know a lot of the details because again, that's stuff that engineers implemented.

1087
00:59:41,508 --> 00:59:45,791
What I'm told is it redirects based on the locale from your IP.

1088
00:59:45,831 --> 00:59:46,351
So if you don't...

1089
00:59:47,204 --> 00:59:50,166
I believe there's a cookie that gets set, and if you're a first-time user and you don't

1090
00:59:50,206 --> 00:59:54,710
have anything, it tries to figure out where you are in the world based on either IP or

1091
00:59:54,770 --> 00:59:57,392
browser settings or something like that to initialize it.

1092
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:13,657
Considering a lot of developers and publishers in the states are kind of ignorant about localization

1093
01:00:13,717 --> 01:00:19,178
and usually localization happens in the end of the production.

1094
01:00:19,358 --> 01:00:23,839
Considering that, it seems like there was a huge leap from 2012 to 2015.

1095
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:29,461
Can you tell me what exactly happened to change that mindset?

1096
01:00:29,481 --> 01:00:32,462
I think at Bungie, a big piece of it was they went independent.

1097
01:00:32,482 --> 01:00:34,742
The last game they published, they were still a part of Microsoft.

1098
01:00:35,233 --> 01:00:39,136
And being internal at Microsoft, they had Microsoft's localization team to work with.

1099
01:00:39,577 --> 01:00:42,759
Localization had never really been something they needed to worry about internally.

1100
01:00:42,799 --> 01:00:46,762
It was something where towards the end of a project, someone who had another job would

1101
01:00:46,782 --> 01:00:50,585
just be tasked with, you know, okay, get the strings together to do a localization handoff,

1102
01:00:50,645 --> 01:00:52,366
get those assets implemented back into the game.

1103
01:00:52,706 --> 01:00:55,268
But there wasn't a need to have dedicated internal people.

1104
01:00:55,709 --> 01:00:59,852
So it was a combination of that, I think, and also just building this new IP and wanting

1105
01:00:59,892 --> 01:01:02,314
to do things right and build a global brand.

1106
01:01:02,694 --> 01:01:03,715
They wanted to make sure that we were...

1107
01:01:04,424 --> 01:01:05,865
taking a good approach to localization.

1108
01:01:06,645 --> 01:01:09,046
Was it just for this game, or was it just

1109
01:01:09,226 --> 01:01:11,426
as a Bungie company itself?

1110
01:01:12,027 --> 01:01:13,987
It's hard for me to say because I came on

1111
01:01:14,027 --> 01:01:15,508
after they'd already decided to start building

1112
01:01:15,528 --> 01:01:16,708
a localization team internally.

1113
01:01:16,768 --> 01:01:20,009
So yeah, half answer, but sorry.

1114
01:01:20,029 --> 01:01:21,470
All right, thanks.

1115
01:01:21,630 --> 01:01:22,090
Yep, thank you.

1116
01:01:22,450 --> 01:01:23,730
I'm sorry, I apologize,

1117
01:01:23,910 --> 01:01:26,051
but it's now time to end the session.

1118
01:01:26,291 --> 01:01:28,812
There is a wrap-up room in cell 300.

1119
01:01:29,252 --> 01:01:31,413
You're welcome to ask additional questions there.

1120
01:01:31,433 --> 01:01:33,193
All right, thank you.
