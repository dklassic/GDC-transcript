00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,731
Hi everyone, and welcome to Creating a Horror Score on a Shoestring Budget.

2
00:00:17,252 --> 00:00:21,833
I'm Spencer Bambrick, I'm the composer for the game Evil Nun, and in this lightning talk,

3
00:00:21,993 --> 00:00:26,375
Gina Zdanowicz and I will be sharing our experience working on this indie horror game.

4
00:00:26,933 --> 00:00:31,216
We'll be talking about some of the creative and logistical decisions we made during development.

5
00:00:31,896 --> 00:00:37,099
So first, for anyone who hasn't played it, Evil Nun is a stealth horror game developed

6
00:00:37,139 --> 00:00:37,959
by Keplerians.

7
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:43,242
The game is first-person, and the player is tasked with solving a series of puzzles in

8
00:00:43,282 --> 00:00:45,163
order to escape an abandoned orphanage.

9
00:00:45,643 --> 00:00:48,924
Of course, there's a terrifying nun that's there to chase you the entire time.

10
00:00:49,565 --> 00:00:52,587
It was released in 2018 for Android and iOS,

11
00:00:53,027 --> 00:00:55,088
and it has since become quite popular

12
00:00:55,128 --> 00:00:56,549
with over 20 million players.

13
00:00:57,289 --> 00:00:59,751
So we hope that you'll all get something useful and interesting

14
00:00:59,811 --> 00:01:00,191
out of this.

15
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:01,612
So let's dive in.

16
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:07,656
First, the takeaways.

17
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:10,778
You'll walk away from this talk with a better understanding

18
00:01:10,978 --> 00:01:14,520
of how to spot a nonlinear score in the horror genre,

19
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,022
how to choose a musical palette that is both terrifying

20
00:01:18,222 --> 00:01:19,023
and low cost.

21
00:01:20,139 --> 00:01:22,881
and you'll walk away with some tools for developer communication,

22
00:01:22,941 --> 00:01:25,003
which is always essential on any score.

23
00:01:26,825 --> 00:01:31,308
So I want to start by talking about the very first step that we took on Evil Nun,

24
00:01:31,408 --> 00:01:32,509
and that is spotting.

25
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:36,852
If you're familiar with film scoring, spotting is when the composer and director

26
00:01:36,893 --> 00:01:40,555
decide on when and how music will be added to each scene.

27
00:01:41,056 --> 00:01:44,238
So before we go any further, I want to show you a quick example of a film

28
00:01:44,278 --> 00:01:47,721
that I think very effectively scares the crap out of its audiences.

29
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:55,465
The film is The Conjuring and we use this scene in particular as a template to kind of decide how the music should work in

30
00:01:55,565 --> 00:01:56,908
Evil Nun, so check it out

31
00:02:17,978 --> 00:02:18,519
Uh, uh, Baron?

32
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:19,700
BELL RINGS

33
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:35,936
BELL RINGS

34
00:02:37,478 --> 00:02:37,838
Baron?

35
00:03:00,285 --> 00:03:13,628
There was a crooked man.

36
00:03:13,748 --> 00:03:19,669
And he walks a crooked mile.

37
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:34,842
Okay, so taking this example as an effective template for spotting, what did we learn?

38
00:03:36,263 --> 00:03:42,225
Well, the first thing, you probably noticed that most of the scene is actually silent musically.

39
00:03:42,725 --> 00:03:48,187
So this is crucial for building tension. Silence is scary because it gives players room to imagine

40
00:03:48,247 --> 00:03:53,349
something much scarier than what they're actually about to experience. Try watching that same scene

41
00:03:53,409 --> 00:03:57,790
again, but from the moment the Crooked Man appears. It's actually a lot less scary without

42
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:58,270
the build-up.

43
00:03:59,174 --> 00:04:03,918
Silence also happens to be very cheap, which is right in line with our goal of coming in under budget.

44
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,062
So our next point is structure.

45
00:04:07,342 --> 00:04:15,050
The structure in this scene is very loosely sort of a silent build plus a chaos plus a denouement or falling action.

46
00:04:16,628 --> 00:04:21,591
So what we wanted to do was to take this structure and mirror it in Evil Nun.

47
00:04:22,151 --> 00:04:29,615
So in Evil Nun, it looked more like our sound effects and ambience, so musical silence, plus a stinger, a chaotic stinger,

48
00:04:30,016 --> 00:04:37,360
and then a loop that could be faded out as the player's distance to the Evil Nun increases.

49
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:41,242
So as the player is running away from the Evil Nun, the loop could be faded out if necessary.

50
00:04:42,094 --> 00:04:44,274
And that constitutes the majority of gameplay.

51
00:04:44,354 --> 00:04:46,115
So here's what it sounds like.

52
00:05:06,903 --> 00:05:09,144
So that's obviously a super short excerpt,

53
00:05:09,264 --> 00:05:11,225
but you can hear how it's all working together.

54
00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:17,415
So the next big question we had to ask ourselves was what instruments do we use?

55
00:05:17,976 --> 00:05:22,882
For us, we chose our instrumentation based on a few key factors, the number one being

56
00:05:22,942 --> 00:05:23,283
budget.

57
00:05:23,483 --> 00:05:26,246
So full orchestra, at least live recorded, was out.

58
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,330
The orchestra you heard in the example was all samples.

59
00:05:31,371 --> 00:05:34,553
And basically, this narrows it down to solo instruments only.

60
00:05:35,093 --> 00:05:37,675
So for those solo instruments, we

61
00:05:37,715 --> 00:05:39,556
had to ask ourselves which instruments

62
00:05:39,576 --> 00:05:40,477
are the most flexible.

63
00:05:40,837 --> 00:05:43,138
Does it have multiple methods of making sound?

64
00:05:43,398 --> 00:05:44,799
How flexible is the timbre?

65
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,260
Does it have a wide range?

66
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,281
Basically, the more options, the better.

67
00:05:50,222 --> 00:05:52,804
Third, we wanted instruments that could take effects

68
00:05:52,864 --> 00:05:53,624
processing well.

69
00:05:54,301 --> 00:05:57,204
Adding plugins can drastically expand the timbral palette.

70
00:05:57,685 --> 00:06:00,448
So remember, with horror games, instruments don't really

71
00:06:00,488 --> 00:06:02,050
have to sound natural at all.

72
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:05,213
In fact, it can be scarier when the sound source is unclear.

73
00:06:05,614 --> 00:06:08,177
But some instruments take distortion and modulation

74
00:06:08,217 --> 00:06:09,658
effects better than others, which

75
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:12,321
is why it's important to choose the right instruments up front

76
00:06:12,402 --> 00:06:13,182
before recording.

77
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:19,980
And finally, it's really important to remember that you're collaborating with people, not instruments.

78
00:06:20,501 --> 00:06:25,762
This means you need to search your network for the person or people that can not only play their instruments well,

79
00:06:26,242 --> 00:06:32,503
but can deliver on time, record themselves professionally, take direction, possibly play multiple instruments,

80
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:35,624
which will save you money, and improvise, which we'll get to.

81
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:43,502
So in the end, we hired two people to play three instruments, violin, saxophone, and clarinet.

82
00:06:43,883 --> 00:06:46,784
We also used a prepared piano, which I played and recorded myself.

83
00:06:47,424 --> 00:06:50,725
So here are a couple sound examples of the prepared piano.

84
00:06:56,748 --> 00:07:00,869
So these are just very simple scrapes and screeches. We took off the top of the piano

85
00:07:00,909 --> 00:07:05,871
and placed some microphones inside. We also added things like chains for this second example.

86
00:07:08,754 --> 00:07:13,337
It's really effective because the piano is so large it kind of adds its own reverb to it.

87
00:07:13,838 --> 00:07:18,061
Plus it costs nothing because I just went down to a local community college and

88
00:07:18,121 --> 00:07:20,804
recorded and played it myself. So it was totally free.

89
00:07:23,246 --> 00:07:26,088
So next I want to talk a little bit about improvisation.

90
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:31,392
So improvisation or aleatory is a staple of the horror genre.

91
00:07:32,013 --> 00:07:37,137
So I always make time to let my collaborators run wild and deliver takes of whatever they think

92
00:07:37,177 --> 00:07:37,678
sounds cool.

93
00:07:38,406 --> 00:07:40,047
Often I'll give them a directive like,

94
00:07:40,388 --> 00:07:42,609
play like you're being chased by a demonic clown,

95
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,891
and that will return some amazing results.

96
00:07:45,452 --> 00:07:47,653
But when I have a specific effect in mind,

97
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:50,396
I'll deliver sheet music that looks something like this.

98
00:07:51,717 --> 00:07:54,619
So this is the exact sheet music that I used

99
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:57,541
for the stinger that plays right when the nun spots you.

100
00:07:58,362 --> 00:08:00,584
The players recorded overdubs of each of these

101
00:08:00,664 --> 00:08:01,985
with some slight variations,

102
00:08:02,405 --> 00:08:04,647
and I mixed them together and added some fun effects.

103
00:08:05,825 --> 00:08:09,928
One thing to remember when you deliver aleatoric sheet music to a musician is

104
00:08:10,408 --> 00:08:13,730
it's really important to be crystal clear on what you want.

105
00:08:14,211 --> 00:08:18,113
The music needs to be readable and you need to do your research on what the norms are

106
00:08:18,393 --> 00:08:22,896
for techniques that extend the timbral range of the instrument or extended techniques.

107
00:08:23,677 --> 00:08:29,821
For example, this triangle note head right here is universally accepted to mean play the highest

108
00:08:29,881 --> 00:08:34,384
note possible. So make sure you understand what symbols you're using so as not to confuse the

109
00:08:34,424 --> 00:08:34,665
player.

110
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,121
I can't stress enough how easy and fun this process is though, so if you're not experimenting

111
00:08:40,141 --> 00:08:42,922
with your own effects when you work with a musician, you're missing out.

112
00:08:43,722 --> 00:08:46,463
So let's take a listen to what each of these sound like.

113
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:50,883
Again, these play right when the nun sees you, if you can remember back to the video,

114
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:56,185
so it's basically the chaos that plays after the silence buildup and before the loop.

115
00:08:56,925 --> 00:08:59,605
So this is the first stinger.

116
00:09:04,735 --> 00:09:07,416
So you can see there's some improvisation on the pitch.

117
00:09:07,476 --> 00:09:08,936
There's no pitch information written,

118
00:09:08,976 --> 00:09:10,637
but the rhythm is very specific.

119
00:09:10,697 --> 00:09:12,418
So each of the overdubs come in line.

120
00:09:12,878 --> 00:09:15,178
These are sort of a high cluster that

121
00:09:15,339 --> 00:09:17,679
glisses down to a low cluster.

122
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:25,542
Here's stinger B. And here's stinger C.

123
00:09:25,562 --> 00:09:31,104
Obviously, that one contains prepared piano as well.

124
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:43,687
Also notice that I mixed these really dry and sort of close to the listener compared to the orchestra that comes in next and I did this intentionally so that it would be really uncomfortable and jarring for the player when the nun spots you.

125
00:09:44,888 --> 00:09:52,012
To come up with your own ideas, it's best to check out contemporary aleatoric scores and use them for inspiration and for notation reference.

126
00:09:52,955 --> 00:09:54,515
This is actually one of my favorite topics,

127
00:09:54,615 --> 00:09:56,556
but we do have to move on because of time.

128
00:09:56,676 --> 00:09:58,957
So please don't hesitate to reach out after the talk.

129
00:09:59,197 --> 00:10:01,438
I have tons of recommendations if you're looking to try this.

130
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:05,259
So the last point that I want to make

131
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,500
is that even if you have no budget at all

132
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,441
for live musicians, there is a lot

133
00:10:09,481 --> 00:10:12,222
you can do on your own to get some scary sounds and textures.

134
00:10:12,782 --> 00:10:15,703
Just to be clear, I absolutely cannot play the violin,

135
00:10:16,103 --> 00:10:18,604
but I use it all the time, especially in horror scores.

136
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:25,614
So I have a few final examples here, and I'm going to take a simple raw recording of me playing the violin badly,

137
00:10:26,094 --> 00:10:30,757
and I'll use just a few plugins to turn it to something dark and scary and kind of musical.

138
00:10:31,758 --> 00:10:35,981
So these examples outline the trajectory of one single take on the violin.

139
00:10:36,601 --> 00:10:38,963
Here's the raw, unprocessed recording.

140
00:10:41,345 --> 00:10:44,587
It's just me scraping the bow across the strings, basically.

141
00:10:45,468 --> 00:10:48,010
Muted strings, no actual notes whatsoever.

142
00:10:57,618 --> 00:10:59,400
You can hear it's pretty unimpressive.

143
00:11:00,301 --> 00:11:01,482
So here's the same recording.

144
00:11:01,502 --> 00:11:05,605
What I did was I took that recording and I threw it into a sampler and I played it an

145
00:11:05,685 --> 00:11:07,867
octave lower so it'll be stretched out as well.

146
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:15,533
So you can hear it's already a little more atmospheric, darker.

147
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,261
Then all I did was add a couple of plugin effects.

148
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:24,982
So I added some EQ to clean it up, just cut out some of the low end.

149
00:11:25,362 --> 00:11:27,803
I added the effects rack from Sound Toys.

150
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:31,944
And all this is is a saturator, a little bit of saturation,

151
00:11:32,064 --> 00:11:35,205
a little bit of echo, and some panning so that part of the signal

152
00:11:35,225 --> 00:11:38,486
will just sort of pan through the stereo spectrum a little bit

153
00:11:38,526 --> 00:11:39,126
back and forth.

154
00:11:39,646 --> 00:11:41,746
And finally, a nice big convolution reverb.

155
00:11:41,886 --> 00:11:44,287
And what the end result sounds like is this.

156
00:12:21,611 --> 00:12:26,353
So to my ear, that's something you could easily work with to get a tension track or an ambient

157
00:12:26,393 --> 00:12:28,233
cue for any kind of horror game.

158
00:12:29,952 --> 00:12:31,093
So one more example

159
00:12:31,973 --> 00:12:36,917
This one's a bit bigger the last example had only one single take of violin this one

160
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:41,020
I overdubbed a bunch of different takes and a couple different kinds of bowing so

161
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:48,525
Here's one raw take where I was actually bowing again. No notes whatsoever. I'm just bowing the wood of the instrument

162
00:12:57,752 --> 00:13:02,860
It's so subtle it's tough to even hear. Then the second one is more of a soul

163
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,866
ponticello which really what that means is I sort of muted the strings and I

164
00:13:07,146 --> 00:13:08,308
played closer to the bridge.

165
00:13:15,518 --> 00:13:18,162
I just did some random tremolo effects there.

166
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:24,270
So what I did with each of these is I recorded a couple extra overdubs and split them into

167
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,391
two separate buses.

168
00:13:25,431 --> 00:13:27,434
So there's three overdubs of the wood.

169
00:13:28,335 --> 00:13:31,876
Bowing and then I think a total of seven for the swole ponticello stuff

170
00:13:33,056 --> 00:13:36,517
I EQ them out again just to clean them up a little bit. I panned them

171
00:13:37,357 --> 00:13:41,718
Wide across the stereo space but nice and evenly so you can get like a big sound

172
00:13:42,678 --> 00:13:45,719
And then the plug-in effects are even simpler than last time

173
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:51,900
there's a little bit of distortion here a little bit of reverb a convolution reverb and then these are just shooting off into

174
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:58,983
some more delays as well. So just a little bit of reverb, a little bit of distortion and

175
00:14:00,243 --> 00:14:02,744
EQ and panning and the result is this.

176
00:14:18,176 --> 00:14:20,798
Bowing the wood especially, I think, is very atmospheric.

177
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:25,681
And it's surprising how realistic the sul ponticello

178
00:14:25,701 --> 00:14:26,462
stuff sounds.

179
00:14:26,502 --> 00:14:28,423
You can overdub that as many times as you want.

180
00:14:28,443 --> 00:14:31,485
And as long as you're mixing it with clarity,

181
00:14:31,565 --> 00:14:32,586
it's going to come out great.

182
00:14:33,407 --> 00:14:34,768
It even sounds a little bit more intimate

183
00:14:34,808 --> 00:14:36,789
than if an orchestra were to play that.

184
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,430
So that's all I have.

185
00:14:39,331 --> 00:14:40,172
Thank you for listening.

186
00:14:40,272 --> 00:14:41,613
I just want to give a quick shout out

187
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:43,454
to Jeff Penny and Aunt Carrie.

188
00:14:44,507 --> 00:14:49,073
They were the wonderful musicians that you heard in those stingers.

189
00:14:49,133 --> 00:14:52,457
So Jeff played the sax and clarinet and Ant played the violin.

190
00:14:52,537 --> 00:14:58,765
So next up, Gina will be talking a little bit about sound implementation and communication

191
00:14:58,785 --> 00:14:59,426
with the developer.

192
00:14:59,927 --> 00:15:00,627
Thank you very much.

193
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:02,249
Thanks, Spencer.

194
00:15:03,421 --> 00:15:06,042
My name is Gina Zdanowicz, founder of Serial Lab Sound.

195
00:15:06,162 --> 00:15:09,484
So let's jump in and start with the budget challenges first.

196
00:15:10,144 --> 00:15:12,345
When a game is developed and financed out of pocket,

197
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:14,686
the budget's likely to be on the smaller side.

198
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:16,647
There are plenty of indie horror games

199
00:15:16,687 --> 00:15:18,127
developed on a slimmer budget,

200
00:15:18,227 --> 00:15:20,468
such as Five Nights at Freddy's and The Forest.

201
00:15:21,413 --> 00:15:24,074
And rather than relying on realistically rendered gore,

202
00:15:24,194 --> 00:15:26,755
Five Nights at Freddy's uses atmosphere and tension

203
00:15:26,795 --> 00:15:27,676
to create scares.

204
00:15:28,276 --> 00:15:29,297
And as Spencer explained,

205
00:15:29,317 --> 00:15:31,118
there's a lot of ways you can create tension

206
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,939
with sound in a game, even on a tighter budget.

207
00:15:34,739 --> 00:15:36,620
So Evil Nun was released and marketed

208
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,322
prior to our team joining development.

209
00:15:39,922 --> 00:15:42,303
And the game devs initially used library music

210
00:15:42,343 --> 00:15:43,164
and sound effects.

211
00:15:43,584 --> 00:15:45,285
And then they saw there was a good amount of interest

212
00:15:45,325 --> 00:15:47,886
in their game and decided to give it an audio treatment.

213
00:15:48,983 --> 00:15:53,004
The game uses a free-to-play model, so their audio budget came mostly from out of pocket.

214
00:15:53,865 --> 00:15:58,286
We did hire a voice artist, Tamara Ryan, for the nun's role, and she was great, willing

215
00:15:58,426 --> 00:16:02,026
to work with us with our non-union budget, and really had fun with it.

216
00:16:03,307 --> 00:16:09,188
I also recorded my nephew, a ten-year-old, for the boy-effort sounds, like the screams

217
00:16:10,068 --> 00:16:10,668
and the breaths.

218
00:16:11,582 --> 00:16:13,643
And we were limited with the number of music loops

219
00:16:13,763 --> 00:16:15,184
we can produce under the budget.

220
00:16:15,304 --> 00:16:18,586
So we added variety by using stingers and silence.

221
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:21,188
And in the end, it made for smoother transitions

222
00:16:21,288 --> 00:16:22,629
as the game states changed.

223
00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:25,650
And as Spencer mentioned, live musicians

224
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:28,132
can add nice tension element to horror scores

225
00:16:28,272 --> 00:16:31,274
by having that ability to produce interesting effects

226
00:16:31,314 --> 00:16:33,815
with their instrument that's difficult to uniquely produce

227
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,036
with virtual instruments.

228
00:16:36,483 --> 00:16:42,206
Both the sound design and music work together in horror games to create that immersive environment.

229
00:16:43,147 --> 00:16:49,170
And we avoided the wall-to-wall music approach to save on budget and also to help the dynamics of the scenes.

230
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:54,693
We pushed for moments of musical silence as the developer originally had constant music throughout,

231
00:16:55,313 --> 00:16:58,274
and we made the sound design a bit more busy than it initially was.

232
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:03,472
Ambiances were louder in the game to add to tension when the music wasn't playing,

233
00:17:03,712 --> 00:17:09,556
and the game has a fine line between music and sound effects as they dance together and share the spotlight.

234
00:17:10,757 --> 00:17:12,777
But getting back to how this worked with music,

235
00:17:13,338 --> 00:17:15,518
if the music were constant and very elevated,

236
00:17:15,538 --> 00:17:17,379
it'd be difficult to hear the footsteps.

237
00:17:17,899 --> 00:17:20,620
Part of the tension building was hearing the footsteps

238
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,401
or the nun singing as she gets closer to the player.

239
00:17:24,142 --> 00:17:25,262
And then the stingers come in

240
00:17:25,302 --> 00:17:27,223
when she's within a certain proximity

241
00:17:27,563 --> 00:17:29,824
and that helps take the tension over the top.

242
00:17:30,744 --> 00:17:32,245
So let's break this down a bit more.

243
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:35,666
Initially, we had the ambience very quiet.

244
00:17:35,706 --> 00:17:37,807
It was just some room tone that we recorded.

245
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:40,626
And we wanted the music to be loud and scary,

246
00:17:40,886 --> 00:17:42,908
but if you remember, we used the technique

247
00:17:43,008 --> 00:17:44,850
which cut the music out when the player moved

248
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:47,793
outside the nun's detection proximity

249
00:17:47,953 --> 00:17:49,154
or distance to the player.

250
00:17:49,975 --> 00:17:51,977
And we did this to extend the use

251
00:17:52,017 --> 00:17:53,719
of the limited music we had in game.

252
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,502
And while this was a great way to get more mileage

253
00:17:56,542 --> 00:18:00,365
out of our music, it made for a very drastic drop in tension.

254
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:01,867
So let's watch an example.

255
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:53,531
So in the end, we decided to create a more textured ambience and boost its volume, so

256
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:56,792
it acted like an extension to the music to keep the tension high.

257
00:18:57,513 --> 00:19:01,634
This was much better, but the ambience was still a bit too loud in this iteration, but

258
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:04,235
we ended up bringing that down slightly for the final mix.

259
00:19:04,275 --> 00:19:05,256
So let's take a look at that.

260
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:26,900
and meet the others.

261
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,141
That is beautiful.

262
00:19:53,347 --> 00:19:56,731
We also made use of DSP to add more dynamics to the game's audio.

263
00:19:57,292 --> 00:20:00,775
Bringing the music down in volume and adding a low-pass filter while the boy is hiding

264
00:20:00,815 --> 00:20:04,259
inside the closet helps focus on the point of view of the player character.

265
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:08,204
We wanted it to sound a bit more realistic in that you would hear his breath more in

266
00:20:08,244 --> 00:20:11,447
the closed-in space, and the sounds outside the closet would be occluded.

267
00:20:12,088 --> 00:20:16,749
This approach was mainly functional, but it also provided a bit of break in the ambience and sound effects.

268
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:18,729
So let's have a look at an example.

269
00:20:19,149 --> 00:20:23,610
In this scene, you're going to hear a bit of ambience come through since there's an opening in the closet.

270
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:27,411
There was no ray casting done in the game to create the occlusion,

271
00:20:27,451 --> 00:20:32,172
so we had to work with a slight low-pass filter and volume ducking snapshots to make it work.

272
00:20:32,572 --> 00:20:38,073
We also had to communicate this to the dev through video snapshots or video captures.

273
00:20:53,967 --> 00:20:54,988
I'll meet the others.

274
00:20:55,068 --> 00:20:56,549
That is beautiful.

275
00:21:21,528 --> 00:21:23,469
Footsteps sound effects were important in the game.

276
00:21:23,869 --> 00:21:26,891
It helps the player know when the nun is in close proximity.

277
00:21:27,171 --> 00:21:29,112
And initially, we had an issue since there

278
00:21:29,152 --> 00:21:30,272
were two floors in game.

279
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,593
We could hear the nun walking above the player.

280
00:21:33,213 --> 00:21:36,955
And we tried to have the devs change the 3D sound settings within Unity.

281
00:21:37,535 --> 00:21:42,016
We started a new Unity project since we weren't doing implementation ourselves,

282
00:21:42,377 --> 00:21:47,158
and we tested the footsteps while creating proper setting in the inspector window.

283
00:21:47,658 --> 00:21:50,259
When we took a screen capture of the component window,

284
00:21:50,299 --> 00:21:54,201
we sent it to the dev so that they can duplicate it, duplicate our settings.

285
00:21:55,001 --> 00:21:59,087
It was still an issue though, even with a low pass filter on the steps after a certain distance.

286
00:21:59,768 --> 00:22:03,654
In the end, the programmers added a script that only allowed footsteps to play when the nun was

287
00:22:03,714 --> 00:22:08,181
on the same plane as the player. So let's listen to an example of the nun's footsteps and

288
00:22:08,481 --> 00:22:10,965
how the music stingers worked when the players detected.

289
00:22:36,366 --> 00:22:36,846
The end

290
00:23:24,118 --> 00:23:27,960
In addition to making the creative choices we just discussed, we had to manage the minimal

291
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,482
resources so we used the Asset Canon implementation approach, so simply meaning the developer

292
00:23:33,522 --> 00:23:35,363
implemented all the sound effects and music.

293
00:23:36,292 --> 00:23:38,854
If you've used audio middleware such as Wwise or FMOD,

294
00:23:39,054 --> 00:23:41,536
you're well aware of how much control the audio designer has

295
00:23:41,596 --> 00:23:43,737
over the mix, the memory footprint, fades,

296
00:23:43,817 --> 00:23:44,658
and randomization.

297
00:23:45,318 --> 00:23:47,560
In this case, since we didn't have control of middleware,

298
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:50,182
we delivered video mockups or sound paintings

299
00:23:50,222 --> 00:23:51,723
to demonstrate our sonic vision.

300
00:23:51,743 --> 00:23:53,764
And this helped the devs get an idea

301
00:23:53,824 --> 00:23:55,345
of the overall use of sound,

302
00:23:55,445 --> 00:23:56,966
especially how the music stingers

303
00:23:57,006 --> 00:23:58,147
should be working in game.

304
00:23:58,948 --> 00:24:01,770
And the videos also demonstrated our complete mix,

305
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:03,011
what we had envisioned.

306
00:24:03,771 --> 00:24:07,153
The loops were all MIDI, but recording stingers with live instruments,

307
00:24:07,753 --> 00:24:11,976
and them being the first thing the player hears, makes the loops feel a bit similar,

308
00:24:12,536 --> 00:24:14,937
as if they were recorded with live musicians as well.

309
00:24:15,758 --> 00:24:20,460
A single overdub of one part of a music track can really change an overall production quality

310
00:24:21,301 --> 00:24:25,643
of the asset, and it's a good way to get more out of your budget and still have that live sound.

311
00:24:26,324 --> 00:24:28,185
So let's have a look at some of the sound paintings.

312
00:24:28,245 --> 00:24:31,228
The first one was our sound painting for the nun's footstep.

313
00:24:31,569 --> 00:24:33,410
We presented this to the developer to say,

314
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,893
this is what we envisioned for how it should work

315
00:24:36,453 --> 00:24:37,835
as it's implemented into the game.

316
00:25:16,999 --> 00:25:18,662
So that mock-up was done in our DAW.

317
00:25:19,082 --> 00:25:20,585
The next one is gonna be a sound painting

318
00:25:20,625 --> 00:25:21,626
for our music stingers.

319
00:25:45,417 --> 00:25:50,059
Again, that was done in our DAW, but it was used to present to the developers, you know,

320
00:25:50,099 --> 00:25:53,961
an example of, hey, this is how we envision these, when they should come in, when they

321
00:25:54,001 --> 00:25:54,561
should play.

322
00:25:54,581 --> 00:26:00,344
And sometimes we would show some of the other sound effects and music incorporated in the

323
00:26:00,384 --> 00:26:04,626
scene so that they get an understanding of what the entire scene should look and sound

324
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:04,846
like.

325
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:14,161
As we mentioned, the game already had temp music and sound effects in place, and the

326
00:26:14,181 --> 00:26:17,446
fanbase had expectations as to what the game sounded like.

327
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:21,312
When we came on board, we wanted to change the original music direction to give it more

328
00:26:21,433 --> 00:26:21,773
tension.

329
00:26:22,534 --> 00:26:27,856
When an update with our new music direction went live, fans of the game were uncomfortable with the new direction,

330
00:26:28,196 --> 00:26:31,497
and it no longer felt like the evil nun game that they were playing.

331
00:26:32,118 --> 00:26:38,340
So keep in mind that this game already had some streamers playing it, and there was 10 million downloads, so quite a big fan base.

332
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:43,061
So we went back to the music and made some changes so it included some hints of the temp music.

333
00:26:43,723 --> 00:26:47,004
We had to change our expectations as to what the game should sound like.

334
00:26:47,204 --> 00:26:51,945
In the end, we should have considered the players might already be partial to the existing sound.

335
00:26:52,905 --> 00:26:56,386
It's always about the player's experience. That's what makes great sound.

336
00:26:58,327 --> 00:27:03,888
We discussed sound paintings through mock-up videos to communicate the implementation process,

337
00:27:03,988 --> 00:27:08,589
but there was also quite a bit of organization we needed to have in place to avoid communication

338
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:08,990
issues.

339
00:27:10,241 --> 00:27:13,223
Due to time zone and language barriers,

340
00:27:13,303 --> 00:27:16,085
we didn't have any face-to-face meetings.

341
00:27:16,325 --> 00:27:18,427
We used Google Sheets to lay out assets

342
00:27:18,487 --> 00:27:20,828
and organize feedback and reference material.

343
00:27:22,828 --> 00:27:25,031
This is an example of how we laid it out.

344
00:27:25,591 --> 00:27:28,875
Basically, we wanted to have as much information as possible.

345
00:27:29,576 --> 00:27:31,959
And even though we had a column for dev comments,

346
00:27:32,219 --> 00:27:34,261
a lot of times they would communicate through email

347
00:27:34,502 --> 00:27:36,404
and it proved to be tricky at times.

348
00:27:36,464 --> 00:27:37,966
There was a lot of back and forth

349
00:27:38,306 --> 00:27:40,489
and waiting due to the time zone differences.

350
00:27:41,405 --> 00:27:44,927
So let's discuss a few tips for organizing feedback from a developer.

351
00:27:45,727 --> 00:27:49,290
It's important to manage how and where your dev provides feedback.

352
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:53,812
Imagine trying to locate feedback in an email when you have five to ten threads

353
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:55,613
with 20 or more replies in each.

354
00:27:56,314 --> 00:28:00,636
Try to set the precedent that one person delivers feedback from the dev side

355
00:28:00,817 --> 00:28:05,579
to avoid having multiple people providing feedback because paths can be crossed,

356
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,421
confusion ensues.

357
00:28:08,388 --> 00:28:12,151
If possible, it's a good idea to manage how often you receive feedback.

358
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:15,773
Not only is the game limited on budget, but also time.

359
00:28:16,093 --> 00:28:21,337
And the developers had planned to release an update as a specific date

360
00:28:21,898 --> 00:28:24,059
and with all the new music and sound effects.

361
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,782
And we were asked to deliver the assets as they were completed.

362
00:28:27,962 --> 00:28:30,944
So this meant we would receive feedback at different intervals for

363
00:28:31,024 --> 00:28:32,345
staggered asset delivery.

364
00:28:32,365 --> 00:28:37,809
And it became difficult to continue creating new assets from our spreadsheet

365
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:42,893
when we were also expected to start making revisions on the delivered assets.

366
00:28:43,633 --> 00:28:47,754
So it's a good idea to try to set a specific timeframe for delivery and feedback.

367
00:28:48,414 --> 00:28:51,175
For example, it would have been better if we delivered on a Friday and

368
00:28:51,215 --> 00:28:52,636
received feedback on a Monday.

369
00:28:52,696 --> 00:28:56,657
So we had a few days to handle revisions and then didn't have to worry about

370
00:28:56,697 --> 00:29:01,458
creating new assets as well as juggling all the feedback and iterations.

371
00:29:03,442 --> 00:29:05,263
Testing, the last thing I'll talk about.

372
00:29:06,083 --> 00:29:07,864
There was definitely a good bit of testing

373
00:29:08,064 --> 00:29:09,405
once the sounds were implemented.

374
00:29:09,705 --> 00:29:13,087
We had early builds on mobile and video capture of gameplay,

375
00:29:14,188 --> 00:29:16,949
but it's always helpful to have video capture from the devs

376
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,510
because it can ensure that you're

377
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:20,932
seeing all the game mechanics or the games being played

378
00:29:20,972 --> 00:29:21,932
the way they envisioned.

379
00:29:22,373 --> 00:29:24,554
When you test on your own without a full understanding

380
00:29:24,574 --> 00:29:27,476
of the gameplay, you could miss important elements in the game.

381
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:35,591
So in the end, we managed to get most of the assets implemented based on all the hurdles that we, you know, jumped over.

382
00:29:35,611 --> 00:29:44,318
And, you know, we did run into a few other issues like reverb zones, and so some of the reverb zones weren't implemented.

383
00:29:44,358 --> 00:29:51,123
So some sound effects felt out of place in the scene, but most of those got fixed up with a later update.

384
00:29:51,943 --> 00:29:53,405
But anyway, thank you for listening.

385
00:29:58,032 --> 00:30:01,956
You've escaped the school
