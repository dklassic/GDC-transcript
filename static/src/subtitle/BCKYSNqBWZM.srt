1
00:00:05,884 --> 00:00:13,457
So, you might look at this and assume that this title is a mistake, that this is some

2
00:00:13,457 --> 00:00:16,462
sort of typo, game design at 0.0003 frames per second.

3
00:00:16,462 --> 00:00:19,968
I'll get into that.

4
00:00:20,849 --> 00:00:21,650
Let's just kind of set that...

5
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:23,992
This is actually what we're doing.

6
00:00:23,992 --> 00:00:27,455
Extrasolar actually renders one frame per hour.

7
00:00:27,455 --> 00:00:29,416
So, set that idea aside for a moment.

8
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:32,819
I'm going to talk a little bit about what the experience of Extrasolar is like,

9
00:00:32,819 --> 00:00:36,022
and then talk a little bit about the evolution of Extrasolar.

10
00:00:36,022 --> 00:00:40,365
It'll slowly sort of explain why I've created the world's least performant video game.

11
00:00:42,495 --> 00:00:47,738
So when you play Extra Solar, it's this story that plays out through video messages, emails,

12
00:00:47,738 --> 00:00:51,700
voicemails, websites, photographs, audio from the planet's surface, images from the planet's

13
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:56,202
surface, terminal systems, all these sort of familiar digital media from your everyday

14
00:00:56,202 --> 00:00:56,402
life.

15
00:00:56,402 --> 00:01:01,144
All the interactions are done through the web, which makes Extra Solar a very realistic

16
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:02,285
experience at times.

17
00:01:02,285 --> 00:01:05,286
Realistic enough that some of our new players have actually asked us to delete their accounts

18
00:01:05,286 --> 00:01:07,487
because they were freaked out, which is pretty cool.

19
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:10,510
And it's very accessible.

20
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,351
This is all done over the web.

21
00:01:12,351 --> 00:01:15,131
So to really understand Extrasolar,

22
00:01:15,131 --> 00:01:17,932
I need to talk a little bit about how we got to this point.

23
00:01:17,932 --> 00:01:19,892
My background isn't really from games.

24
00:01:19,892 --> 00:01:22,453
I got a PhD from MIT in computer graphics.

25
00:01:22,453 --> 00:01:26,614
It was very much non-real time, photorealistic rendering.

26
00:01:26,614 --> 00:01:29,054
Spent a couple summers at Pixar working on Monsters, Inc.

27
00:01:29,054 --> 00:01:29,835
and Finding Nemo.

28
00:01:29,835 --> 00:01:31,975
And I was really interested in this idea

29
00:01:31,975 --> 00:01:35,496
of how could I bring gorgeous photoreal graphics

30
00:01:35,496 --> 00:01:38,097
to a casual audience that's never really seen them before.

31
00:01:38,877 --> 00:01:41,920
And the web made sense as a platform for that.

32
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,281
But WebGL isn't quite there.

33
00:01:43,281 --> 00:01:47,724
You have to worry a lot about minimum specifications and hardware.

34
00:01:47,724 --> 00:01:50,687
So it just wasn't quite clear what we could do through the web.

35
00:01:50,687 --> 00:01:54,710
You know, there are people like OnLive who are doing streaming in the cloud,

36
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,412
you know, video generation in the cloud.

37
00:01:56,412 --> 00:01:58,553
But even OnLive can't afford to do...

38
00:01:58,942 --> 00:02:00,744
live video streaming, as it turns out.

39
00:02:00,744 --> 00:02:04,008
So I started to think about what if I was rendering clouds

40
00:02:04,008 --> 00:02:06,491
non-real time, or rendering images non-real time

41
00:02:06,491 --> 00:02:08,994
in the cloud, one image every few hours.

42
00:02:08,994 --> 00:02:12,157
And as soon as I sort of came up with this concept,

43
00:02:12,157 --> 00:02:14,500
I thought to myself, what would that game be?

44
00:02:15,079 --> 00:02:17,143
The answer was immediately obvious.

45
00:02:17,143 --> 00:02:21,150
This is exactly the way that exploration on Mars works right now with NASA.

46
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:24,916
They upload commands to the rover, hours later they get back a gorgeous image,

47
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:27,000
and they move on in their exploration from there.

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,723
So this was sort of the inception of the idea.

49
00:02:30,236 --> 00:02:43,652
So what we did when we created extrasolar was we created this fiction where in the world that we've created, we're claiming that more than a decade ago, a private space agency launched a rover, a mission to an extrasolar planet.

50
00:02:43,652 --> 00:02:46,775
And it's not just any extrasolar planet.

51
00:02:46,775 --> 00:02:47,636
This one has the...

52
00:02:47,797 --> 00:02:49,958
It's in the habitable zone of its destination star.

53
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:52,020
So there's the potential for life.

54
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,362
On this mission, we packed our probe with rovers, dozens

55
00:02:55,362 --> 00:02:56,703
and dozens of rovers that we're putting down

56
00:02:56,703 --> 00:02:57,944
on the surface of this planet, on this island.

57
00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:00,786
And so we're going to crowdsource exploration.

58
00:03:00,786 --> 00:03:04,108
So now that we've arrived, we're looking for volunteers

59
00:03:04,108 --> 00:03:06,870
to log into our web-based system and help explore this planet

60
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,671
one photo at a time.

61
00:03:07,671 --> 00:03:10,993
And those volunteers will help us uncover not just

62
00:03:10,993 --> 00:03:13,015
the mysteries of the planet, but also

63
00:03:13,015 --> 00:03:14,816
the mysteries surrounding XRI, the private space

64
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,157
agency that's running this.

65
00:03:18,338 --> 00:03:26,447
So I think I skipped a slide there.

66
00:03:26,447 --> 00:03:26,787
There we go.

67
00:03:26,787 --> 00:03:28,989
So it's a really unusual and new design space.

68
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:32,313
And so with that in mind, it's sort of like we kind of found

69
00:03:32,313 --> 00:03:35,576
ourselves wandering in the wilderness and trying to figure

70
00:03:35,576 --> 00:03:39,220
out how to move around in this really open-ended space and

71
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,422
how to focus our design ideas.

72
00:03:43,138 --> 00:03:46,879
So I'm going to try, like in retrospect, we found some rules that worked really well for us.

73
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:52,642
So I'm going to try to relay those to everybody else out here in hopes that other people can apply the same rules to their own projects.

74
00:03:52,642 --> 00:04:04,426
So what we came up with this with this idea of core design values, nothing really, you know, crazy novel here, but something that we found that if we really focus time on this at work for us, we wanted to make

75
00:04:05,447 --> 00:04:09,129
We wanted to find a set of values that allowed us to make fast, consistent design decisions.

76
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:12,631
And oftentimes, like, when you're designing a game with your team,

77
00:04:12,631 --> 00:04:15,293
you have hundreds of individual design decisions to make.

78
00:04:15,293 --> 00:04:18,394
And it's often tough to get your team to agree on those individual design decisions.

79
00:04:18,394 --> 00:04:23,778
But what we found is that it wasn't very hard to get our team to agree on these core design values.

80
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:29,339
And once we could agree on those, it was a lot easier to reference those to make these lower level design decisions.

81
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:31,920
So these are something that the whole team should understand.

82
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:36,641
They don't necessarily have to agree on the core design values, even though it's usually not tough to get people on board,

83
00:04:36,641 --> 00:04:40,942
but they should at least understand them so they can reference them to make their lower level decisions.

84
00:04:40,942 --> 00:04:45,943
And these core design values is fine for these things to evolve over time, and it was very much the case for extrasolar.

85
00:04:46,683 --> 00:04:52,088
Extrasolar started first as an exploration game, starting from this inception, this seed of

86
00:04:52,088 --> 00:04:56,511
one photo at a time to explore an alien planet, all rendered in the cloud.

87
00:04:56,511 --> 00:05:00,615
Using, sort of applying the best practices and trying to increase virality of that game,

88
00:05:00,615 --> 00:05:02,657
we quickly arrived at using social mechanics.

89
00:05:02,657 --> 00:05:04,558
And we thought, we'll do this like an alternate reality game.

90
00:05:04,558 --> 00:05:07,200
I'll talk a little bit more about that in a second.

91
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,543
But sort of, you know, we'll have people explore together and you can share your map

92
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:13,446
and you can share your species catalog and all your discoveries.

93
00:05:14,632 --> 00:05:17,175
And we thought, to really have a hook to get people on board,

94
00:05:17,175 --> 00:05:18,897
let's add a little bit of a story element here.

95
00:05:18,897 --> 00:05:19,898
So we added a little story.

96
00:05:19,898 --> 00:05:22,580
And the more we built on the story,

97
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,764
the more we realized that the story was really

98
00:05:25,764 --> 00:05:28,306
a lot more special than the cloud-based rendering was.

99
00:05:29,643 --> 00:05:33,266
Not only that, but the social mechanics interfered with the story,

100
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:36,427
because the story was setting up this position where you,

101
00:05:36,427 --> 00:05:39,289
not an avatar, but you were a special character

102
00:05:39,289 --> 00:05:41,970
at the center of this giant conspiracy.

103
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,552
And when you were sharing your feelings

104
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:46,333
as you were going through this conspiracy with your friends,

105
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:47,213
it just didn't work.

106
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:48,614
The fiction fell apart.

107
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:52,676
And so we sort of minimized the role of the social media.

108
00:05:52,676 --> 00:05:56,038
So the process that we were going through here in our evolution was

109
00:05:56,038 --> 00:05:58,059
first to find the gem at the heart of your game.

110
00:05:59,054 --> 00:06:01,956
Then adjust your core design values to allow that gem to

111
00:06:01,956 --> 00:06:02,477
shine through.

112
00:06:02,477 --> 00:06:03,738
And here's the hard part.

113
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:06,020
Throw away anything that isn't working for you.

114
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,921
Throw away anything that's interfering with your core

115
00:06:07,921 --> 00:06:08,322
design values.

116
00:06:08,322 --> 00:06:11,985
And it's really easy to fall into the trap of assuming that

117
00:06:11,985 --> 00:06:15,428
the place and subsystems where you've spent most of your time

118
00:06:15,428 --> 00:06:16,069
are going to be the gem.

119
00:06:16,069 --> 00:06:17,710
And that's not necessarily the case.

120
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,593
And for this case, what we realized was that the renderer,

121
00:06:20,593 --> 00:06:22,955
the place where we'd spent all of our time, really needed to

122
00:06:22,955 --> 00:06:24,296
be subordinate to the story.

123
00:06:24,296 --> 00:06:25,798
And the story needed to shine through.

124
00:06:27,224 --> 00:06:32,327
So these are the core design values that we ended up with after going through this evolutionary process a few times.

125
00:06:32,327 --> 00:06:33,828
One, the fiction is paramount.

126
00:06:33,828 --> 00:06:38,311
Two, it should be as accessible as possible to as wide an audience as possible.

127
00:06:38,311 --> 00:06:40,973
And three, to be very respectful of the player's time.

128
00:06:40,973 --> 00:06:46,296
And I'm going to talk about how these core design values led us to make some really unusual and unconventional decisions.

129
00:06:47,455 --> 00:06:51,737
So it's hard to discuss extrasolar without talking about alternate reality games.

130
00:06:51,737 --> 00:06:55,599
I'm going to talk a little bit about it here, partly because the term ARG is overloaded in game design.

131
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,340
It can mean augmented reality games or alternate reality games.

132
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:02,281
So I'm going to be talking about alternate reality games, which are things like the launch of Portal 2,

133
00:07:02,281 --> 00:07:04,942
The Beast, The Majestic, or I Love Bees, which launched with Halo.

134
00:07:06,763 --> 00:07:08,985
As Extrasolar Evolved, it definitely looked like an ARG.

135
00:07:08,985 --> 00:07:11,287
And so we looked, I did a lot of research,

136
00:07:11,287 --> 00:07:14,210
and read a lot of white papers on previous ARG design to figure out

137
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,651
what lessons I could learn from that.

138
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:19,074
And there are a lot of business challenges with an ARG.

139
00:07:19,074 --> 00:07:21,656
If we wanted to create this emotional experience,

140
00:07:21,656 --> 00:07:23,117
a feeling like you're a character...

141
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:27,111
in this world, this story that's wrapped around you,

142
00:07:27,111 --> 00:07:28,172
that feels very real.

143
00:07:28,172 --> 00:07:30,073
But we wanted to avoid these ARG pitfalls.

144
00:07:30,073 --> 00:07:32,434
So we wanted a story that you can start at any time

145
00:07:32,434 --> 00:07:34,095
and play solo at any pace from any location.

146
00:07:34,095 --> 00:07:37,617
And these are some of the common ARG channels that we avoid.

147
00:07:37,617 --> 00:07:40,239
So community-driven puzzle solving, real-world media

148
00:07:40,239 --> 00:07:43,120
and events, physical locations, all of these things limit.

149
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,081
Generally, with an ARG, you have these players

150
00:07:45,081 --> 00:07:45,822
that are coming in.

151
00:07:45,822 --> 00:07:48,363
They're solving really hard puzzles as a community,

152
00:07:48,363 --> 00:07:49,444
moving forward in time.

153
00:07:49,444 --> 00:07:51,565
But if you come in late, or if you come in

154
00:07:51,565 --> 00:07:53,746
after the ARG is over, there's nothing left for you to do.

155
00:07:54,226 --> 00:07:59,189
Or if you don't live in San Francisco or Seattle or wherever the ARG is taking place, there's nothing for you to do.

156
00:07:59,189 --> 00:08:04,132
Or if you're just intimidated by working with a giant group of people, there's nothing for you to do.

157
00:08:04,132 --> 00:08:09,015
So we really wanted to create this experience that you could play at any time, any place, at your own pace.

158
00:08:09,015 --> 00:08:13,918
And these last two ones, SMS messages or phone calls, these are really cool channels for storytelling,

159
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:17,100
but it also assumes that you have a North American phone plan for the most part.

160
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,424
And we found, very surprisingly to us, even though we just launched four weeks ago,

161
00:08:21,424 --> 00:08:25,228
25% of our players are from countries that don't have English as their primary language,

162
00:08:25,228 --> 00:08:27,990
even though we have not localized into any other languages.

163
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:31,534
So it's made, like, this accessibility, what I'm saying, it's really mattered.

164
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:35,874
So these are other, also, common channels for storytelling.

165
00:08:35,874 --> 00:08:37,495
And these are the ones that we're using.

166
00:08:37,495 --> 00:08:39,917
Websites, email, PDF files, these are all,

167
00:08:39,917 --> 00:08:42,079
they can all be accessed over the web,

168
00:08:42,079 --> 00:08:44,041
all accessible through basically any browser,

169
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:45,482
including your tablet or your phone.

170
00:08:45,482 --> 00:08:47,964
And the nice thing about these channels

171
00:08:47,964 --> 00:08:49,785
is that everyone understands them,

172
00:08:49,785 --> 00:08:51,487
and they're part of the fabric

173
00:08:51,487 --> 00:08:53,729
of your everyday digital interactions with your life.

174
00:08:53,729 --> 00:08:57,072
And the result is that weaving a story into these channels

175
00:08:57,072 --> 00:08:59,093
feels really compelling and very real.

176
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:04,090
So as I mentioned, as I kind of hinted before,

177
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:05,571
our core design values led us to make

178
00:09:05,571 --> 00:09:06,852
some unconventional design decisions.

179
00:09:06,852 --> 00:09:08,313
And to frame, as a reminder, those

180
00:09:08,313 --> 00:09:10,134
are that one, that the fiction is paramount,

181
00:09:10,134 --> 00:09:11,875
make it as accessible as possible,

182
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:12,675
and respect the player's time.

183
00:09:12,675 --> 00:09:15,317
So to frame this portion of the conversation,

184
00:09:15,317 --> 00:09:17,538
I want to talk a little bit about the magic formula.

185
00:09:17,538 --> 00:09:20,680
We all spend a lot of time looking at other games

186
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,862
and trying to reverse engineer the magic formula.

187
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:25,923
This is unfortunately why there are 60 new Flappy Bird clones

188
00:09:25,923 --> 00:09:28,705
a day on the iPhone, because everybody just thought

189
00:09:28,705 --> 00:09:29,145
that, you know.

190
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,006
They can reproduce that success.

191
00:09:31,006 --> 00:09:32,768
So the problem with...

192
00:09:32,768 --> 00:09:34,289
Looking at the magic formula,

193
00:09:34,289 --> 00:09:36,430
trying to reverse engineer someone else's success

194
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:38,751
is absolutely a worthwhile activity.

195
00:09:39,857 --> 00:09:41,218
But there are some things to be careful of.

196
00:09:41,218 --> 00:09:43,200
One is that there's a feedback loop in the system.

197
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,322
So once a niche has been exploited,

198
00:09:45,322 --> 00:09:47,745
it's unlikely that you'll be able to make money on that niche again,

199
00:09:47,745 --> 00:09:50,307
the way that the original niche exploiter has done.

200
00:09:50,307 --> 00:09:52,610
Two, and this is a big one,

201
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:55,492
the space of all possible games is enormous.

202
00:09:55,492 --> 00:09:57,454
And we have seen about this much of it,

203
00:09:57,454 --> 00:10:00,077
maybe about this much of it, this tiny little bit.

204
00:10:00,257 --> 00:10:05,819
And when we explore only, when we allow our design mechanics to be driven by the lessons

205
00:10:05,819 --> 00:10:09,000
learned from others, we're really, we get tunnel vision.

206
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,501
All we're seeing is this little space.

207
00:10:11,501 --> 00:10:14,482
It also means that we're a little fish in a big pond.

208
00:10:14,482 --> 00:10:17,682
We're competing with all the other people who are trying to compete in that space.

209
00:10:17,682 --> 00:10:21,264
So what I really want to encourage people to do, and this is easier said than done,

210
00:10:21,264 --> 00:10:22,844
is just to write your own formula.

211
00:10:22,844 --> 00:10:24,945
Be okay with...

212
00:10:26,073 --> 00:10:30,277
not necessarily following the path and making your own rules.

213
00:10:30,277 --> 00:10:35,002
It's okay to be a small fish in a small pond, and if you're the first one to get there,

214
00:10:35,002 --> 00:10:37,044
you're in a great advantage to own that niche.

215
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:44,682
So I'm going to walk through four specific unconventional design decisions that our core design values led us to make.

216
00:10:44,682 --> 00:10:47,805
The first one, and this is going to be a bit of a spoiler,

217
00:10:47,805 --> 00:10:53,069
I assure you there are plenty of other surprises to be had by playing Extrasolar.

218
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:57,613
The first thing is that when you first sign up for Extrasolar,

219
00:10:57,613 --> 00:11:02,557
you do it through a website, you apply to the program, it all looks like this is real stuff.

220
00:11:02,557 --> 00:11:04,978
You're applying to a private space exploration company.

221
00:11:05,757 --> 00:11:09,841
and then we reject you. We're sorry, we're over capacity, no more rovers available.

222
00:11:09,841 --> 00:11:12,384
A few minutes later, the next chapter of the story plays out in your email.

223
00:11:12,384 --> 00:11:15,788
A hacker contacts you and says that they can get you in the back door.

224
00:11:15,788 --> 00:11:16,889
You need to cooperate with them.

225
00:11:17,684 --> 00:11:22,468
And it's controversial because we lose about 24% of our players at this stage.

226
00:11:22,468 --> 00:11:26,871
And we're improving that, and so this is the kind of thing that no company would ever do.

227
00:11:26,871 --> 00:11:30,974
Part of the reason we do this, this is really just the email validation system,

228
00:11:30,974 --> 00:11:37,318
but going along with our core design value of respecting the player's time,

229
00:11:37,318 --> 00:11:43,182
we thought, wouldn't it be cool if the email validation system was part of the story?

230
00:11:43,182 --> 00:11:46,284
And so, from the get-go, we do this.

231
00:11:46,725 --> 00:11:51,108
So we lose players here, but it helps to establish the emotional experience.

232
00:11:51,108 --> 00:11:53,470
And it's really powerful when people get this message.

233
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:58,614
It also helps to establish the expectation that this is going to be unlike any game that you've ever played.

234
00:11:58,614 --> 00:12:00,696
It's going to play out through multiple channels.

235
00:12:00,696 --> 00:12:05,199
And the result is that the retention rates are ridiculously high.

236
00:12:05,199 --> 00:12:07,661
So we just looked at our accounts yesterday.

237
00:12:07,661 --> 00:12:13,565
Of the 4,400 players who have gotten through this step in the four weeks since launch,

238
00:12:13,565 --> 00:12:14,546
35% logged in yesterday.

239
00:12:15,247 --> 00:12:19,130
So, you know, for a free-to-play game, these retention rates are ridiculous.

240
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:22,953
To give you another example of how engaged players are,

241
00:12:22,953 --> 00:12:27,116
the whole story is about 250 pages of written content that plays out through all these channels

242
00:12:27,116 --> 00:12:28,937
that I mentioned at the beginning of the talk.

243
00:12:28,937 --> 00:12:32,199
We have a player who's written 194 pages of her own analysis.

244
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:36,503
So people, like, you know, this gets along with, like,

245
00:12:36,503 --> 00:12:38,504
with Glanbier's talk just before this, like,

246
00:12:38,504 --> 00:12:41,146
the community will find you, and they will,

247
00:12:41,146 --> 00:12:43,088
they will pimp you when you don't have to.

248
00:12:44,574 --> 00:12:48,359
Unconventional design decision number two is our ridiculously generous demo.

249
00:12:48,359 --> 00:12:52,505
So partly because, and this is kind of starting from the bottom here,

250
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:55,349
partly because Extrasolar is such a weird and unusual experience,

251
00:12:56,237 --> 00:12:58,078
It's very hard to sell up front.

252
00:12:58,078 --> 00:12:59,759
It's very hard to get people on board.

253
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:02,420
We decided that the only way to really build an audience

254
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:05,421
was to give away all of what we're calling Season 1 for free.

255
00:13:05,421 --> 00:13:07,902
And it's not a small amount of content.

256
00:13:07,902 --> 00:13:12,043
Like I said, it's about 250 pages of written content.

257
00:13:12,043 --> 00:13:14,704
On average, it takes a player 27 days to complete that content.

258
00:13:14,704 --> 00:13:16,345
27 real-time days.

259
00:13:16,345 --> 00:13:18,526
And players can optionally pay to upgrade,

260
00:13:18,526 --> 00:13:19,987
but there's no penalty if you don't.

261
00:13:19,987 --> 00:13:21,347
You still get the entire story.

262
00:13:21,347 --> 00:13:23,148
You can just play a little bit faster if you pay.

263
00:13:24,655 --> 00:13:27,796
Unconventional design decision number three is that we force

264
00:13:27,796 --> 00:13:29,276
the players to wait.

265
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:31,657
Like I said at the beginning, the whole mechanic started with

266
00:13:31,657 --> 00:13:33,097
what do we do with rendering in the cloud?

267
00:13:33,097 --> 00:13:36,678
So especially for players who are accustomed to sitting down

268
00:13:36,678 --> 00:13:38,919
for two or three hours and playing a game and really kind

269
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:41,780
of just getting into that game, the waiting is really

270
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,001
frustrating at first for this gamer audience.

271
00:13:44,621 --> 00:13:48,143
But even those people, they come back to us about a week later and post on their forums,

272
00:13:48,143 --> 00:13:51,486
they really appreciate it's become part of their daily routine.

273
00:13:51,486 --> 00:13:53,087
And it doesn't waste their time.

274
00:13:53,087 --> 00:13:55,388
And I wouldn't necessarily endorse playing games at work,

275
00:13:55,388 --> 00:13:57,330
but everybody says it's a great game to play at work.

276
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:01,913
And because there's no filler, and it's respectful of the player's time,

277
00:14:01,913 --> 00:14:05,615
it's just like, it feels, I don't know, it just feels, it's just much more satisfying.

278
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,661
This all leads... Oh, the other thing is, on this point, we brainstormed...

279
00:14:09,661 --> 00:14:11,842
People kept asking to spend more time in this game.

280
00:14:11,842 --> 00:14:15,403
And so we brainstormed all kinds of little mini-games to grind,

281
00:14:15,403 --> 00:14:17,884
and other things that you can do.

282
00:14:17,884 --> 00:14:21,425
And they all sucked. I mean, they might have been fun to stand alone,

283
00:14:21,425 --> 00:14:23,085
but they all compromised the fiction.

284
00:14:23,085 --> 00:14:25,906
And none of... They all just made it feel like a game,

285
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:29,387
rather than a story that you were a part of.

286
00:14:29,387 --> 00:14:29,827
And so, in chorus...

287
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:34,488
In a lot... Going along with our unconventional design decision number one, which was...

288
00:14:35,489 --> 00:14:37,572
make everything subordinate to the fiction,

289
00:14:37,572 --> 00:14:38,975
we threw all those mechanics out.

290
00:14:38,975 --> 00:14:43,243
And this kind of leads us into unconventional design decision number four,

291
00:14:43,243 --> 00:14:44,745
which is monetization.

292
00:14:44,745 --> 00:14:47,670
And this is, you know, this is the source of a lot of talk here at GDC.

293
00:14:49,364 --> 00:14:55,407
The image that I'm showing here is kind of a caricature, maybe, of what the best practices say for monetization right now.

294
00:14:55,407 --> 00:15:00,009
The whole dual currency system, microtransaction with a grind economy.

295
00:15:00,009 --> 00:15:05,872
The dual currency, you typically have one currency for your time-rich cash-poor player who wants to grind to earn more.

296
00:15:06,327 --> 00:15:08,587
You have another currency for your cash-rich, time-poor

297
00:15:08,587 --> 00:15:10,327
player who would rather pay to get ahead.

298
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:11,408
They value their time.

299
00:15:11,408 --> 00:15:14,308
And there's usually an exchange rate between these things.

300
00:15:14,308 --> 00:15:15,449
But it all focuses around grind.

301
00:15:15,449 --> 00:15:18,629
And as I mentioned, any attempt that we made to add

302
00:15:18,629 --> 00:15:19,890
grind to the game compromised the fiction.

303
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:23,110
And the other thing is, when you see these currencies, like

304
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:27,932
when every transaction that you do within the game has,

305
00:15:27,932 --> 00:15:29,292
basically, you have the choice.

306
00:15:29,292 --> 00:15:32,453
Do you want to make the better version of this transaction?

307
00:15:32,453 --> 00:15:35,153
Or do you want to do the lame, free version

308
00:15:35,153 --> 00:15:35,973
of this transaction?

309
00:15:36,954 --> 00:15:38,474
It just feels icky.

310
00:15:38,474 --> 00:15:42,315
And it really was a reminder, constant reminder that this is a game,

311
00:15:42,315 --> 00:15:45,316
and not a story that you're participating in.

312
00:15:45,316 --> 00:15:47,077
So what we ended up with,

313
00:15:47,077 --> 00:15:50,498
so the constant microtransactions hurt the fiction.

314
00:15:50,498 --> 00:15:52,159
Paying up front, like I said, is not an option.

315
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,840
You can't ask someone to pay up front, and then immediately reject them,

316
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,021
because they'll just be really pissed off.

317
00:15:58,021 --> 00:16:00,021
So we basically went with an episodic content model.

318
00:16:00,482 --> 00:16:05,084
So you can play the whole episode one for free.

319
00:16:05,084 --> 00:16:07,846
You can pay $9.50 to play a little faster, or $25 for all

320
00:16:07,846 --> 00:16:09,666
three episodes up front, only one of which

321
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,067
is completed so far.

322
00:16:11,067 --> 00:16:13,308
And the numbers are pretty good based on this.

323
00:16:13,308 --> 00:16:15,650
We actually have 15% of payers play, and our average revenue

324
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:18,191
per user is about, it's probably going to settle

325
00:16:18,191 --> 00:16:19,952
around $2.50 when we're all done, which is pretty darn

326
00:16:19,952 --> 00:16:21,573
good for a free-to-play game.

327
00:16:21,573 --> 00:16:24,714
So rather than our interface looking like this, which

328
00:16:24,714 --> 00:16:27,576
basically is, this is the kind of interface that you get

329
00:16:27,576 --> 00:16:28,376
when you worry about.

330
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:31,601
How do I make my players pay?

331
00:16:31,601 --> 00:16:34,646
We ended up with this, which is much more of an interface

332
00:16:34,646 --> 00:16:38,012
designed around, how can we allow our fans to easily

333
00:16:38,012 --> 00:16:39,013
support us?

334
00:16:39,013 --> 00:16:41,016
And it's not just by buying a membership for themselves, but

335
00:16:41,016 --> 00:16:43,039
they can also buy gift memberships for their friends.

336
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:50,187
So, I mean, it's easy to say, make unconventional design decisions and find success that way,

337
00:16:50,187 --> 00:16:54,092
especially since we haven't really found our financial success yet, we're still working

338
00:16:54,092 --> 00:16:55,294
on that.

339
00:16:55,294 --> 00:16:59,399
But one of the ways that we found to do this was to involve unconventional contributors

340
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:00,080
in your process.

341
00:17:01,512 --> 00:17:03,834
And for those of us who grew up as gamers,

342
00:17:03,834 --> 00:17:07,097
and those of us who have been in the industry for a long time,

343
00:17:07,097 --> 00:17:09,960
it's very hard to get away from our assumptions.

344
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,822
But it's really easy to just take other voices

345
00:17:12,822 --> 00:17:14,043
from outside of the community.

346
00:17:14,043 --> 00:17:15,865
And I don't just mean non-game developers.

347
00:17:15,865 --> 00:17:16,825
I mean non-gamers.

348
00:17:16,825 --> 00:17:19,047
Bring them in and have them involved.

349
00:17:19,047 --> 00:17:21,049
And the example that I want to give in this case

350
00:17:21,049 --> 00:17:22,631
is that we involved a biologist named

351
00:17:22,631 --> 00:17:25,373
Jane Van Susteren in the development of extra solar.

352
00:17:25,373 --> 00:17:27,034
We wanted it to be very science heavy.

353
00:17:27,034 --> 00:17:28,355
We really want to create positive role

354
00:17:28,355 --> 00:17:29,296
models for scientists.

355
00:17:29,697 --> 00:17:32,100
So we would show images of the surface of the planet to Jane,

356
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,601
and we would say, what do you want

357
00:17:33,601 --> 00:17:34,262
to know about these plants?

358
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:36,105
And she would say, first of all, you can't call them plants.

359
00:17:36,105 --> 00:17:37,426
They're not related to plants on Earth.

360
00:17:37,426 --> 00:17:38,868
Let's call them something else.

361
00:17:38,868 --> 00:17:40,370
We'll call them photobionts.

362
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:42,332
Secondly, I want to know, are they cellular?

363
00:17:42,332 --> 00:17:43,674
Do they photosynthesize?

364
00:17:43,674 --> 00:17:44,775
How do they reproduce?

365
00:17:44,775 --> 00:17:46,557
And we took this content word for word

366
00:17:46,557 --> 00:17:48,279
and actually turned it into missions in the game.

367
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,181
And our fans love it.

368
00:17:50,181 --> 00:17:53,702
The science, the real science that came from that has been amazing.

369
00:17:53,702 --> 00:17:58,565
And these are missions that would never have come from someone who spent a lot of time playing World of Warcraft.

370
00:17:58,565 --> 00:18:00,726
It's just a different mentality around the design.

371
00:18:00,726 --> 00:18:08,370
And in fact, we love them so much that Jane Van Susteren actually plays a character by her own name in the game.

372
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:12,212
After all, if we want to be serious about making positive role models for female scientists,

373
00:18:12,212 --> 00:18:14,613
why not have one directly play a character within the game?

374
00:18:14,613 --> 00:18:17,995
And that's also been extremely well received by our community.

375
00:18:19,346 --> 00:18:21,987
So I like to think that Extrasolar feels like a big game,

376
00:18:21,987 --> 00:18:26,408
and from an indie standpoint it might be a large team and a large budget.

377
00:18:26,408 --> 00:18:29,529
But I think for the size that the game feels,

378
00:18:29,529 --> 00:18:31,350
I think it was actually a fairly small team.

379
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,470
The core team is four programmers and one artist.

380
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,531
I'm the only full-time, everybody else is part-time.

381
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:38,372
Development cycle has been about three and a half years,

382
00:18:38,372 --> 00:18:40,132
and the cost so far has been about $600,000,

383
00:18:40,132 --> 00:18:43,513
with $400,000 of that going directly to our part-time team.

384
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:50,542
So the way that we've managed to make this big feeling game with this beautiful imagery

385
00:18:50,542 --> 00:18:54,363
is really taking advantage of some of the constraints of the system that we have.

386
00:18:54,363 --> 00:18:57,345
So the big one, you know, when you make a normal real-time game,

387
00:18:57,345 --> 00:19:00,186
and I'm sure pretty much everybody in here is familiar with this process,

388
00:19:00,186 --> 00:19:03,628
where you spend a lot of time at the end of the game development cycle

389
00:19:04,008 --> 00:19:06,551
making sure that the frame rate is good for every piece of hardware,

390
00:19:06,551 --> 00:19:09,575
making sure that it operates on every piece of hardware and doesn't crash,

391
00:19:09,575 --> 00:19:11,758
you know, making sure that it works, you know, setting your min spec

392
00:19:11,758 --> 00:19:13,700
and making sure that it works with that,

393
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,903
making sure that you don't have popping artifacts

394
00:19:15,903 --> 00:19:17,224
and you have temporal coherence.

395
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:20,722
making sure that it degrades gracefully on lower end hardware.

396
00:19:20,722 --> 00:19:22,643
These take actually a ton of time.

397
00:19:22,643 --> 00:19:25,404
And when you toss these constraints out the window,

398
00:19:25,404 --> 00:19:27,645
and you don't have to worry about these,

399
00:19:27,645 --> 00:19:31,767
our renderer takes an average of six seconds to render an image.

400
00:19:31,767 --> 00:19:34,448
About half of that is actually pulling it out of the back buffer

401
00:19:34,448 --> 00:19:37,050
in high resolution, compressing it to JPEG,

402
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,611
and uploading it to the Amazon Web Services.

403
00:19:40,231 --> 00:19:43,314
But the point is that we just don't have to worry about frame rate.

404
00:19:43,314 --> 00:19:44,835
And that's been extremely liberating.

405
00:19:44,835 --> 00:19:47,998
We can basically operate in much more of an academic environment.

406
00:19:47,998 --> 00:19:49,900
We want to, you know, we want to ray trace the clouds.

407
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,381
Well, how much time is that going to take?

408
00:19:51,381 --> 00:19:52,102
It's an extra half second.

409
00:19:52,102 --> 00:19:54,764
Not a problem. Half a second. Not a big deal.

410
00:19:54,764 --> 00:19:55,585
So it's really liberating.

411
00:19:55,585 --> 00:19:58,507
It's been a lot of fun to work on this project because of that reason.

412
00:19:59,185 --> 00:20:01,246
Another place where we're really taking advantage of the

413
00:20:01,246 --> 00:20:03,407
constraints is in our client design.

414
00:20:03,407 --> 00:20:06,608
So we wanted the client to be as accessible as possible,

415
00:20:06,608 --> 00:20:09,009
which was our core design decision number two.

416
00:20:09,009 --> 00:20:11,790
We wanted the client to be able to basically run on any

417
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:15,992
browser, old computers, all the way down to IE8.

418
00:20:15,992 --> 00:20:19,613
So we decided no Flash, no Unity, no WebGL, no Canvas, no

419
00:20:19,613 --> 00:20:22,795
plugins, and the result is that all the development is

420
00:20:22,795 --> 00:20:24,816
done in JavaScript, which actually ends up being.

421
00:20:24,816 --> 00:20:27,297
We have to use JavaScript and HTML4 in some very clever and

422
00:20:27,297 --> 00:20:28,497
creative ways.

423
00:20:28,797 --> 00:20:31,058
But it's ultimately a much easier development process.

424
00:20:31,058 --> 00:20:35,041
So I want to talk now about some of the lessons learned

425
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:37,082
and hopefully distill this down into things that

426
00:20:37,082 --> 00:20:38,522
will be useful for other teams.

427
00:20:39,479 --> 00:20:42,761
First one, as I mentioned before, find the gem at the heart of your game.

428
00:20:42,761 --> 00:20:48,784
Use that gem, design your core design values around that gem to allow it to really shine through.

429
00:20:48,784 --> 00:20:52,705
And here's the tough part, cull away anything that compromises your core design values,

430
00:20:52,705 --> 00:20:54,346
ignoring sunk costs.

431
00:20:54,346 --> 00:20:58,968
It doesn't matter that you spent a year of time sinking it into some subsystem.

432
00:20:58,968 --> 00:21:02,670
If that subsystem is making the game worse, you need to throw it out.

433
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:05,251
And the corollary to this is that if there's no gem,

434
00:21:05,852 --> 00:21:10,033
If you really look and there's no gem, no amount of polish is going to help.

435
00:21:10,033 --> 00:21:13,195
No amount of artwork or sound design around that is going to help.

436
00:21:13,195 --> 00:21:17,097
Go back to the prototype stage, keep iterating until that gem shows up.

437
00:21:17,097 --> 00:21:20,978
It's probably there somewhere.

438
00:21:20,978 --> 00:21:22,919
Next one is to establish question design principles.

439
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:26,621
And it's important to study these and understand the rationale behind these things,

440
00:21:26,621 --> 00:21:28,441
but also decide if they're applicable to you.

441
00:21:28,441 --> 00:21:32,363
And the reason is that taking a different route can lead you to a less crowded niche.

442
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:33,980
This is a common one.

443
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,001
Listen to your fans.

444
00:21:35,001 --> 00:21:39,065
And by listen to your fans, I don't just mean read the forums.

445
00:21:39,065 --> 00:21:42,048
If you have any way to look at actual player behavior,

446
00:21:42,048 --> 00:21:46,112
Vlambeer was up here talking about watching the YouTube videos.

447
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:49,315
That's a great way to directly see what your fans are doing

448
00:21:49,315 --> 00:21:51,296
and trying to figure out their intent.

449
00:21:51,296 --> 00:21:52,177
And we do a lot of this.

450
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:56,181
We look at how people play and adapt the parameters of the game accordingly.

451
00:21:56,902 --> 00:22:02,205
An example of this, one of our super fans was mentioning that she kept setting up a

452
00:22:02,205 --> 00:22:08,349
camera at the same location at different times of day, and she was using it to do a study

453
00:22:08,349 --> 00:22:08,769
on the tides.

454
00:22:08,769 --> 00:22:12,552
And we hadn't modeled the tides, but there was no reason that we couldn't.

455
00:22:12,552 --> 00:22:15,534
And so we went ahead, it was something that was easy to add, so we're adding back in the

456
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:18,756
modeling of the tides, which is really great when fans are that invested in what you're

457
00:22:18,756 --> 00:22:18,856
doing.

458
00:22:20,388 --> 00:22:22,990
Also, be careful, don't listen to your fans too much.

459
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:25,051
Partly because Extrasolar is such an unusual game,

460
00:22:25,051 --> 00:22:29,373
we got all kinds of requests for people who wanted to upgrade their weapons,

461
00:22:29,373 --> 00:22:31,894
and shoot aliens, and shoot their friend's rover.

462
00:22:31,894 --> 00:22:34,975
And if we allowed people to make those decisions for us,

463
00:22:34,975 --> 00:22:38,277
obviously it would heavily compromise what the game was actually all about.

464
00:22:38,277 --> 00:22:39,477
So, be careful there.

465
00:22:40,855 --> 00:22:44,176
And finally, unencumber yourself from preconceptions, design preconceptions.

466
00:22:44,176 --> 00:22:48,317
Like I mentioned before, a good way to do this is to get diverse voices,

467
00:22:48,317 --> 00:22:51,959
to give you new ideas, people who don't consider themselves gamers.

468
00:22:51,959 --> 00:22:53,599
Write your own formulas for success.

469
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:58,101
And here's going to be my final takeaway, is jam frequently.

470
00:22:58,101 --> 00:23:03,303
You know, I go to a lot of jams and more and more I see that there are a lot of people looking for jobs there,

471
00:23:03,303 --> 00:23:06,464
but not a lot of people who are established in the industry.

472
00:23:06,464 --> 00:23:08,885
I don't get it. Guys, you're not too old to jam.

473
00:23:09,937 --> 00:23:13,119
Jams are so liberating and fulfilling.

474
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:18,003
When you've been grinding on a game development cycle for years,

475
00:23:18,003 --> 00:23:21,545
completing an entire game in a 48-hour cycle

476
00:23:21,545 --> 00:23:24,748
is hugely empowering and liberating and energizing.

477
00:23:24,748 --> 00:23:28,711
It's also a space where you can fail without consequences.

478
00:23:28,711 --> 00:23:32,834
And a lot of really great game ideas have started out as jams.

479
00:23:33,574 --> 00:23:37,016
So Jam, the other thing that Jams teach you is to design with constraints.

480
00:23:37,016 --> 00:23:40,337
It's very typical for a Jam to be run around some theme.

481
00:23:40,337 --> 00:23:47,601
And the nice thing about those themes is a lot of diversity in ideas emerges around those themes.

482
00:23:47,601 --> 00:23:49,461
So try designing with constraints.

483
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:54,023
Get accustomed to designing with constraints, because that's a really good lesson to work with.

484
00:23:54,023 --> 00:23:57,845
And with that, I think we have about a minute for questions.

485
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:32,056
Any questions? Or you can take this time and pull out your device and go to extrasolar.com.

486
00:24:36,938 --> 00:24:38,538
to like the regular tier, but then if you pay me,

487
00:24:38,538 --> 00:24:40,739
because I'm a hacker and there's a little bit of a risk on me,

488
00:24:40,739 --> 00:24:43,480
like give me $30 and I'll get you into like the super tier.

489
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,721
Did you think about something like that?

490
00:24:46,721 --> 00:24:48,882
I could totally see a hacker doing that.

491
00:24:48,882 --> 00:24:50,662
This is a mail message that we have like redesigned

492
00:24:50,662 --> 00:24:52,943
and redesigned over and over again to try to, one,

493
00:24:52,943 --> 00:24:58,425
get as many people through that back door as possible,

494
00:24:58,425 --> 00:25:01,426
and two, get people to stop emailing me telling me

495
00:25:01,426 --> 00:25:03,346
that there's a hacker in our system.

496
00:25:03,346 --> 00:25:04,366
I guess I'd make it worse then.

497
00:25:04,728 --> 00:25:10,952
But I think that, you know, we've decided to delay the option to pay as long as possible.

498
00:25:10,952 --> 00:25:12,293
Was that the question?

499
00:25:12,293 --> 00:25:16,036
It's like, have we thought about moving up the monetization layer earlier?

500
00:25:16,036 --> 00:25:19,718
Just one another another way of getting like the upfront charge.

501
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:20,338
So like

502
00:25:20,968 --> 00:25:23,508
sell them the whole game or, you know, the first part of the game.

503
00:25:23,508 --> 00:25:26,869
We hadn't considered it, but at that point you still really don't know what you're getting into.

504
00:25:26,869 --> 00:25:31,950
Like, you might have come into the game in a way that familiarized you with the mechanics.

505
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:35,031
We have kind of a kiosk system where you can explore the mechanics first.

506
00:25:35,031 --> 00:25:39,992
But we don't really hint at the story until this hacker gets you in the back door.

507
00:25:39,992 --> 00:25:44,472
So we kind of, we think it's best to let people wait to make that decision until later.

508
00:25:44,472 --> 00:25:46,593
All right, and one, I'm sorry, real quick follow-up.

509
00:25:47,058 --> 00:25:49,179
I haven't played the game, but does that hacker...

510
00:25:49,179 --> 00:25:50,320
Do you have a relationship with that hacker?

511
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,921
Or is that the last contact you have with him?

512
00:25:51,921 --> 00:25:54,263
You have a very big relationship with that hacker.

513
00:25:54,263 --> 00:25:56,824
That plays out through the entire season one,

514
00:25:56,824 --> 00:26:00,047
and there are, I promise you, a lot of mysteries in store there.

515
00:26:00,047 --> 00:26:00,907
All right. Thank you.

516
00:26:00,907 --> 00:26:02,168
And I think that, yeah, I'm being told to cut off.

517
00:26:02,168 --> 00:26:07,452
If other people have questions, I'm going to go to the wrap-up room,

518
00:26:07,452 --> 00:26:08,632
which I believe is room 3000.

519
00:26:08,632 --> 00:26:10,994
So if anybody wants to ask other questions there,

520
00:26:10,994 --> 00:26:11,855
please join me there.

521
00:26:11,855 --> 00:26:12,695
Thank you.
