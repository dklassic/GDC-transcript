1
00:00:08,098 --> 00:00:12,741
Hey guys, so housekeeping, I have been asked to ask you

2
00:00:12,741 --> 00:00:15,243
to move towards the center and be friends

3
00:00:15,243 --> 00:00:17,064
with your pal next door to you,

4
00:00:17,064 --> 00:00:20,226
and then afterwards to fill out your evaluations.

5
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,823
So, this is so great to be presenting at the Narrative Summit.

6
00:00:25,823 --> 00:00:29,987
I always look forward to being with such kindred spirits for these couple days.

7
00:00:29,987 --> 00:00:35,311
So this session is called Unpopular Opinion, All Narrative is Linear.

8
00:00:35,311 --> 00:00:39,875
Very strategically placed right after a talk about non-linear narratives.

9
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:41,301
It's going well.

10
00:00:41,301 --> 00:00:45,545
So clearly I was reading a BuzzFeed article

11
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:49,629
when I wrote this.

12
00:00:49,629 --> 00:00:50,369
So I'm Amy.

13
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:53,032
A lot of folks give an introduction here,

14
00:00:53,032 --> 00:00:55,374
but I think the best way to know me

15
00:00:55,374 --> 00:00:57,756
is to know how I came to understand stories

16
00:00:57,756 --> 00:00:59,919
and consequently how I approach game design.

17
00:00:59,919 --> 00:01:01,260
So I'll jump right in.

18
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,061
All narrative is linear.

19
00:01:06,539 --> 00:01:10,660
Movies, books, Aristotle, life, songs, the hero's journey,

20
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:14,281
sports, and even games that seem like they couldn't possibly

21
00:01:14,281 --> 00:01:15,561
be so.

22
00:01:15,561 --> 00:01:18,622
From MOBAs with stories emerging from cooperative gameplay,

23
00:01:18,622 --> 00:01:21,182
to strategy games with compelling core loops,

24
00:01:21,182 --> 00:01:25,063
to branching experiences, to sandbox games, to open worlds,

25
00:01:25,063 --> 00:01:28,024
even to games with elongated aesthetic distances stemming

26
00:01:28,024 --> 00:01:32,285
from ludonarrative distance, all follow the same structure

27
00:01:32,285 --> 00:01:34,825
as all narratives have for thousands of years.

28
00:01:36,593 --> 00:01:40,176
When it comes to our work as game makers,

29
00:01:40,176 --> 00:01:41,876
the core loop is not a story.

30
00:01:41,876 --> 00:01:43,898
It's a possibility space.

31
00:01:43,898 --> 00:01:49,961
Unravel the loop, and you will see a player's actual narrative.

32
00:01:49,961 --> 00:01:54,144
Because until we can change the time-space continuum,

33
00:01:54,144 --> 00:01:56,885
players will always experience narratives linearly.

34
00:01:56,885 --> 00:01:59,387
So what does this look like?

35
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,681
We've seen this structure before.

36
00:02:02,681 --> 00:02:06,524
We all probably have some variation of Mrs. Hodge

37
00:02:06,524 --> 00:02:09,626
in elementary school giving you your first essay

38
00:02:09,626 --> 00:02:12,108
and being told it has to have an introductory paragraph

39
00:02:12,108 --> 00:02:15,650
and a thesis and a few body paragraphs on that thesis

40
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:18,332
and a conclusion, but why?

41
00:02:18,332 --> 00:02:23,695
It's the human experience, which can be summed up so simply

42
00:02:23,695 --> 00:02:26,357
as tracking tension over time.

43
00:02:27,853 --> 00:02:31,654
Because it's in that life, swells of emotion, good and bad,

44
00:02:31,654 --> 00:02:33,455
over the time we're given.

45
00:02:33,455 --> 00:02:38,036
So maybe that's not so controversial,

46
00:02:38,036 --> 00:02:42,036
that players experience narrative linearly because time.

47
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:47,537
But I think what is an unpopular opinion

48
00:02:47,537 --> 00:02:50,578
is that this way of looking at games

49
00:02:50,578 --> 00:02:53,659
needs to be central to our development processes.

50
00:02:53,659 --> 00:02:54,679
Because one.

51
00:02:55,855 --> 00:02:57,797
It creates a tool for speaking directly

52
00:02:57,797 --> 00:03:02,060
to the hearts of our players.

53
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,382
And two, it acts as a common language

54
00:03:04,382 --> 00:03:06,744
for multidisciplinary teams.

55
00:03:06,744 --> 00:03:08,505
So what is this language?

56
00:03:08,505 --> 00:03:10,727
We see it clearly in movies.

57
00:03:10,727 --> 00:03:11,768
Introduction.

58
00:03:11,768 --> 00:03:12,628
Girl is sad.

59
00:03:12,628 --> 00:03:14,730
Inciting incident.

60
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,091
Girl meets boy.

61
00:03:16,091 --> 00:03:17,952
A question is asked.

62
00:03:17,952 --> 00:03:18,813
Will girl get boy?

63
00:03:18,813 --> 00:03:20,975
It's always a yes or no question.

64
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:28,612
Rising action, shenanigans ensue, a series of hurdles related to that main question.

65
00:03:28,612 --> 00:03:34,274
Climax, Drew Barrymore stands in a ball field and after what seems like forever,

66
00:03:34,274 --> 00:03:37,776
she has the most epic camera spinning kiss.

67
00:03:37,776 --> 00:03:39,056
Did girl get boy?

68
00:03:39,056 --> 00:03:44,298
Yes, the climax always answers that question, whether it be yes or no.

69
00:03:44,298 --> 00:03:47,619
Finally, the resolution and indication of what's to come.

70
00:03:47,619 --> 00:03:50,020
For Drew Barrymore, a hint of happily ever after.

71
00:03:52,626 --> 00:03:58,069
It's also the story of life, conception, trimesters, birth.

72
00:03:58,069 --> 00:03:58,569
It's also a sports game.

73
00:03:58,569 --> 00:04:04,232
So my training is originally in theater

74
00:04:04,232 --> 00:04:07,294
and I had a professor who said, he was Bulgarian,

75
00:04:07,294 --> 00:04:10,276
so I'm gonna do an atrocious accent.

76
00:04:10,276 --> 00:04:15,398
He'd say, why would people rather watch sports than theater?

77
00:04:15,398 --> 00:04:18,280
Because in sport, one ball.

78
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,041
In bad theater, many balls.

79
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:28,386
Meaning, in a compelling story, we're only tracking one thing at a time.

80
00:04:28,386 --> 00:04:34,935
So when I'm in a really good play, I can turn around and watch the audience heads all move

81
00:04:34,935 --> 00:04:37,738
in unison, as if they're watching an invisible ball.

82
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:43,147
When I learned these narrative rules,

83
00:04:43,147 --> 00:04:45,308
no longer were my plays hit or miss.

84
00:04:45,308 --> 00:04:47,848
Suddenly there was a formula to arrange emotions

85
00:04:47,848 --> 00:04:50,509
into an almost musical composition.

86
00:04:50,509 --> 00:04:53,210
There was this answer I had been waiting for,

87
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,551
the holy grail of timeless tales,

88
00:04:55,551 --> 00:04:57,352
perfectly linear narrative.

89
00:04:57,352 --> 00:04:59,192
Then I joined the games industry.

90
00:04:59,192 --> 00:05:00,453
Y'all messed it up.

91
00:05:07,818 --> 00:05:11,140
With your core loops and your branching narrative charts

92
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,322
and your progression spreadsheets and wireframes

93
00:05:14,322 --> 00:05:18,225
and player metrics and UX flows and even a linear tutorial

94
00:05:18,225 --> 00:05:21,467
or two, which is even more confusing.

95
00:05:21,467 --> 00:05:27,471
So back when I was a wee lass, circa 2013,

96
00:05:27,471 --> 00:05:29,232
I got my start in mobile games.

97
00:05:29,232 --> 00:05:32,454
And I was so excited to take my knowledge of story structure

98
00:05:32,454 --> 00:05:35,236
and make experiences that were incredibly human.

99
00:05:36,691 --> 00:05:42,675
I did learn very quickly that there is a tension between being human and the realities of game

100
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:43,456
development.

101
00:05:43,456 --> 00:05:52,122
I like the Red Bull and the iced coffee combo on the desk there.

102
00:05:52,122 --> 00:05:57,586
So making games requires translating experiences into software, a language of zeros and ones.

103
00:05:58,572 --> 00:06:03,412
Consequently, top-down ways of speaking about games,

104
00:06:03,412 --> 00:06:05,613
our core loops, our state machines, our metrics,

105
00:06:05,613 --> 00:06:08,353
and so on, are incredibly valuable.

106
00:06:08,353 --> 00:06:11,274
Any developer will tell you that building a game

107
00:06:11,274 --> 00:06:13,714
that actually works is a battle.

108
00:06:13,714 --> 00:06:17,715
But any developer will also tell you

109
00:06:17,715 --> 00:06:21,075
that there's another battle, that feeling of disconnect,

110
00:06:21,075 --> 00:06:23,316
the late-night despair of losing sight

111
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:25,976
of why a game speaks to our hearts.

112
00:06:25,976 --> 00:06:27,196
That battle is just as real.

113
00:06:30,107 --> 00:06:33,550
For me, my feeling of disconnect came from not speaking

114
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:35,452
the same language as our team leaders.

115
00:06:35,452 --> 00:06:36,914
Having come from a different field,

116
00:06:36,914 --> 00:06:39,877
I wasn't able to translate these top-down metrics

117
00:06:39,877 --> 00:06:42,640
and loops into something I could meaningfully contribute to.

118
00:06:44,131 --> 00:06:47,113
This is what happens when you get together a bunch of people

119
00:06:47,113 --> 00:06:49,735
who are at the top of their various fields in engineering

120
00:06:49,735 --> 00:06:51,477
and business and design and art and production,

121
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:54,279
all these people that it requires

122
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:56,120
to make a game these days.

123
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,443
The language we use to talk about experiences

124
00:06:59,443 --> 00:07:03,126
is anything but linear and anything but standardized,

125
00:07:03,126 --> 00:07:04,467
which is exciting.

126
00:07:04,467 --> 00:07:06,869
I'm a big fan of diversity in all of its forms.

127
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:11,939
But it also creates a very real tension in communication on teams.

128
00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:15,888
As a storyteller in a zeros and ones world, I felt lost.

129
00:07:18,282 --> 00:07:21,643
So I read Jesse Schell's book, The Art of Game Design,

130
00:07:21,643 --> 00:07:24,224
A Book of Lenses, and I thought he put things really well.

131
00:07:24,224 --> 00:07:28,766
There are progressive games where there's a linear story,

132
00:07:28,766 --> 00:07:31,387
and there are emergent games where gameplay is king.

133
00:07:31,387 --> 00:07:33,928
Books are progressive because you turn the page

134
00:07:33,928 --> 00:07:36,829
and the story progresses, and chess is emergent

135
00:07:36,829 --> 00:07:39,510
because the gameplay emerges from the players.

136
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,431
It's dynamic, it's highly replayable.

137
00:07:41,431 --> 00:07:44,733
I'm so happy to finally understand

138
00:07:44,733 --> 00:07:46,493
how what I did related to games.

139
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:50,378
But there was this terrifying fear bubbling underneath,

140
00:07:50,378 --> 00:07:52,440
the fear that the closer games got

141
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,562
to the emergent end of the spectrum,

142
00:07:54,562 --> 00:07:56,964
the more my skills were unwanted.

143
00:07:56,964 --> 00:08:00,346
To combat this fear, I went to work making epic storylines

144
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:02,928
with lore and backstory and nuance.

145
00:08:02,928 --> 00:08:07,412
I'd stay up late creating my narrative vision

146
00:08:07,412 --> 00:08:09,934
and wonder why they couldn't see that.

147
00:08:09,934 --> 00:08:12,756
Epic storylines are exactly what every broad appeal

148
00:08:12,756 --> 00:08:15,218
mass market casual mobile title needs.

149
00:08:17,428 --> 00:08:22,190
One day, someone I trusted pulled me aside and said,

150
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:24,350
you know what, this game just doesn't need story.

151
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:28,051
It's hard not to hear that as,

152
00:08:28,051 --> 00:08:29,752
this game just doesn't need you.

153
00:08:29,752 --> 00:08:35,594
Well, I thought, I really only have one option.

154
00:08:35,594 --> 00:08:42,035
I'm going to completely disregard everything anyone says

155
00:08:42,035 --> 00:08:45,476
and make a new theory of game design to prove them wrong.

156
00:08:45,476 --> 00:08:46,137
So here it is.

157
00:08:47,345 --> 00:08:55,746
So Amy's theory on how all games are linear.

158
00:08:55,746 --> 00:08:58,007
We're going to go look at three experiences.

159
00:08:58,007 --> 00:09:04,188
Jaws, Life is Strange, and Minecraft, all on a different place on the spectrum, and

160
00:09:04,188 --> 00:09:08,269
each one getting a little messier on how to prove that linear narrative works on the most

161
00:09:08,269 --> 00:09:11,229
progressive games and also ones that break all the rules.

162
00:09:11,229 --> 00:09:11,309
Jaws.

163
00:09:14,075 --> 00:09:17,998
So truly linear narrative cannot be a game.

164
00:09:17,998 --> 00:09:20,680
A game implies player interaction.

165
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,803
Instead we'll look at the structure of a movie,

166
00:09:24,803 --> 00:09:27,004
one that is expertly crafted to hit

167
00:09:27,004 --> 00:09:28,345
all the traditional storytelling beats.

168
00:09:28,345 --> 00:09:31,668
Jaws starts with a shark attack,

169
00:09:31,668 --> 00:09:34,890
but don't mistake this for the inciting incident.

170
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:37,412
We have not met our protagonist yet, so it can't be.

171
00:09:37,412 --> 00:09:39,073
Enter Chief Brody.

172
00:09:40,892 --> 00:09:44,355
Now that our hero is here, the call to adventure can happen.

173
00:09:44,355 --> 00:09:48,719
Chief Brody reads the coroner's report, shark attack.

174
00:09:48,719 --> 00:09:52,742
The question is asked, will Chief Brody kill the shark?

175
00:09:52,742 --> 00:09:53,222
Yes or no?

176
00:09:53,222 --> 00:09:56,925
During the rising action, complications arise,

177
00:09:56,925 --> 00:10:00,348
all to do with this question of killing the shark.

178
00:10:00,348 --> 00:10:01,869
First, a child is killed.

179
00:10:01,869 --> 00:10:06,092
Then Chief Brody's own kid is in the water

180
00:10:06,092 --> 00:10:07,293
when a surfer gets killed.

181
00:10:08,871 --> 00:10:12,794
Next Brody and his two sidekicks get on a boat, a big boat.

182
00:10:12,794 --> 00:10:16,778
Quinn the sea dog gets eaten by a shark.

183
00:10:16,778 --> 00:10:19,360
Hooper the oceanographer is in danger.

184
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,321
Brody himself is in danger.

185
00:10:20,321 --> 00:10:25,746
And then, there's the climax.

186
00:10:25,746 --> 00:10:29,229
No question that Chief Brody did indeed kill that shark.

187
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:29,449
It's dead.

188
00:10:29,449 --> 00:10:29,949
It's pretty dead.

189
00:10:32,648 --> 00:10:36,010
Finally, the resolution gives a hint of what's to come.

190
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,031
So if you actually watch to the end of the credits,

191
00:10:38,031 --> 00:10:40,313
you'll see that Brody and Hooper get back to shore.

192
00:10:40,313 --> 00:10:40,913
So obviously this is a movie,

193
00:10:40,913 --> 00:10:41,654
but if we pretended it was a game

194
00:10:41,654 --> 00:10:45,856
and we took three different players,

195
00:10:45,856 --> 00:10:49,899
they would all have the same linear path

196
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,760
through that experience.

197
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,581
So let's see how that changes

198
00:10:53,581 --> 00:10:55,002
when we talk about Life is Strange.

199
00:10:57,265 --> 00:10:59,647
Life is Strange, stunning game by Dontnod,

200
00:10:59,647 --> 00:11:01,207
published by Square Enix.

201
00:11:01,207 --> 00:11:04,849
You play Max, and Max has the power to rewind time

202
00:11:04,849 --> 00:11:06,610
to make a different choice.

203
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:07,951
For all intents and purposes,

204
00:11:07,951 --> 00:11:10,512
Life is Strange is a very traditional narrative.

205
00:11:10,512 --> 00:11:11,573
It happens to be branching.

206
00:11:11,573 --> 00:11:12,894
So, this is a whole talk in of itself,

207
00:11:12,894 --> 00:11:18,857
but in Life is Strange, the entire series

208
00:11:18,857 --> 00:11:22,279
has a traditional narrative structure,

209
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:25,380
as does its five episodes, as does each individual scene.

210
00:11:26,908 --> 00:11:29,089
We're gonna look at the Frank confrontation scene

211
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:30,150
in episode four.

212
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:33,131
It's a little microcosm for what we're talking about.

213
00:11:33,131 --> 00:11:37,612
It demonstrates that even with branching narrative,

214
00:11:37,612 --> 00:11:44,055
every individual path follows the same linear structure rules.

215
00:11:44,055 --> 00:11:45,295
Introduction.

216
00:11:45,295 --> 00:11:48,657
All three players have the same experience so far.

217
00:11:48,657 --> 00:11:51,238
Max and Chloe meet a client list

218
00:11:51,238 --> 00:11:53,578
from their friendly neighborhood drug dealer, Frank.

219
00:11:55,518 --> 00:11:56,458
Inciting incident.

220
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:57,859
Chloe knocks on the door.

221
00:11:57,859 --> 00:11:59,179
No turning back.

222
00:11:59,179 --> 00:12:00,720
Will they get that client list?

223
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,220
Yes or no?

224
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:01,741
Rising action.

225
00:12:01,741 --> 00:12:05,362
Negotiations begin.

226
00:12:05,362 --> 00:12:06,863
Frank does not trust them.

227
00:12:06,863 --> 00:12:08,383
This is where it splits.

228
00:12:08,383 --> 00:12:11,385
Depending on how you negotiate,

229
00:12:11,385 --> 00:12:13,606
you can either tap into Frank's emotions

230
00:12:13,606 --> 00:12:14,306
and soften him up.

231
00:12:14,306 --> 00:12:18,328
You can upset him and set his dog on the attack.

232
00:12:18,328 --> 00:12:20,589
Or things can go south and Chloe can pull a gun.

233
00:12:21,654 --> 00:12:24,017
These are all relevant to that central question

234
00:12:24,017 --> 00:12:24,998
of getting that client list,

235
00:12:24,998 --> 00:12:28,381
and they all grow in emotional intensity.

236
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:30,564
Consequently, all three choices are satisfying

237
00:12:30,564 --> 00:12:33,247
and allow for a level of meaningful player choice

238
00:12:33,247 --> 00:12:36,170
that a purely progressive experience couldn't.

239
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:39,954
Likewise, when we get to the climax,

240
00:12:39,954 --> 00:12:41,355
there are three meaningful choices.

241
00:12:42,382 --> 00:12:45,144
Frank can give the client list willingly.

242
00:12:45,144 --> 00:12:47,405
Chloe can injure Frank, causing him to give it

243
00:12:47,405 --> 00:12:49,086
not so willingly.

244
00:12:49,086 --> 00:12:50,547
Or Chloe can kill Frank

245
00:12:50,547 --> 00:12:52,369
and take the client list off his body.

246
00:12:52,369 --> 00:12:55,751
So, will Max and Chloe get the client list?

247
00:12:55,751 --> 00:12:59,553
All paths lead to yes, but the journey is different.

248
00:12:59,553 --> 00:13:01,575
And finally, in the scenes resolution,

249
00:13:01,575 --> 00:13:06,118
if Frank doesn't die, the girls walk away relieved.

250
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,259
If he does, there's an emotional toll

251
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:10,461
that is carried through the rest of the game.

252
00:13:14,699 --> 00:13:18,543
Here is the developer's chart of all the branching paths

253
00:13:18,543 --> 00:13:19,764
in this scene.

254
00:13:19,764 --> 00:13:23,448
When I saw this, it blew me away at how much player agency

255
00:13:23,448 --> 00:13:24,109
there is.

256
00:13:24,109 --> 00:13:29,916
But this is a very top-down way of looking

257
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:33,540
at the scene, which is useful for implementation.

258
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,103
But if we kind of turn it 90 degrees.

259
00:13:38,655 --> 00:13:41,336
You'll see the linear narrative, which is extremely

260
00:13:41,336 --> 00:13:42,457
useful for emotion.

261
00:13:42,457 --> 00:13:45,739
Every player is hitting the same beats, the same

262
00:13:45,739 --> 00:13:48,521
complications, but their story is different.

263
00:13:48,521 --> 00:13:51,482
A developer's ability to map the music of emotions is an

264
00:13:51,482 --> 00:13:54,484
incredible tool, not only for giving players compelling

265
00:13:54,484 --> 00:13:58,727
stories, but for getting a team on the same page.

266
00:13:58,727 --> 00:14:00,588
I'll go into more detail on that at the end of the talk.

267
00:14:00,588 --> 00:14:00,708
For me.

268
00:14:04,851 --> 00:14:06,552
When I started looking at branching narrative

269
00:14:06,552 --> 00:14:08,374
in a similar way that I might look at Jaws,

270
00:14:08,374 --> 00:14:12,457
it was a real aha moment, as Oprah Winfrey might call it.

271
00:14:12,457 --> 00:14:15,579
Because if you extrapolate on this idea

272
00:14:15,579 --> 00:14:20,282
that each player path creates a traditional story structure,

273
00:14:20,282 --> 00:14:22,864
and you consider that each scene, each episode,

274
00:14:22,864 --> 00:14:26,106
and each series also has that structure,

275
00:14:26,106 --> 00:14:27,608
you can extrapolate how these branching

276
00:14:27,608 --> 00:14:29,969
and nested structures could grow infinitely

277
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:32,451
to become a three-dimensional sandbox-like game.

278
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:36,997
And that's what we're going to talk about when we talk about Minecraft and emergent games.

279
00:14:36,997 --> 00:14:39,119
At first glance, when looking at Minecraft, it is confusing to see the narrative.

280
00:14:39,119 --> 00:14:41,581
There doesn't seem to be an end.

281
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:43,523
You choose your play style.

282
00:14:43,523 --> 00:14:47,067
Night and day give some semblance of story structure.

283
00:14:47,067 --> 00:14:50,571
And then there's creative mode.

284
00:14:50,571 --> 00:14:55,256
And where is the story there?

285
00:14:55,256 --> 00:14:56,176
What am I missing?

286
00:14:57,734 --> 00:15:00,975
The open world is a good metaphor for all the possibilities

287
00:15:00,975 --> 00:15:03,096
for paths a player might take.

288
00:15:03,096 --> 00:15:05,077
We often talk about different player types

289
00:15:05,077 --> 00:15:06,698
or different gameplay styles

290
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:10,319
when we talk about sandbox games.

291
00:15:10,319 --> 00:15:12,360
So why is that in particular so important?

292
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:19,022
Because suddenly the player is the protagonist,

293
00:15:19,022 --> 00:15:22,063
which makes the player's inciting incident

294
00:15:22,063 --> 00:15:25,165
the discovery of what they're driven to accomplish.

295
00:15:27,973 --> 00:15:29,694
Will I build an epic house?

296
00:15:29,694 --> 00:15:34,257
Will I become the best baddie killer in the land?

297
00:15:34,257 --> 00:15:37,019
Will I connect with my friends?

298
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:41,402
So as it happens, my friend Catherine

299
00:15:41,402 --> 00:15:43,443
is player type number three.

300
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:46,645
So I asked her to tell me her experience of playing Minecraft.

301
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:49,888
So we'll use it to break down what

302
00:15:49,888 --> 00:15:52,850
that looks like using good old linear narrative structure.

303
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:53,230
Introduction.

304
00:15:57,553 --> 00:15:59,634
I started playing because my friends were playing.

305
00:15:59,634 --> 00:16:03,876
I'd wait to play until other people were online.

306
00:16:03,876 --> 00:16:08,679
We used Discord and we would chat about the game beforehand

307
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:09,760
and then chat in-game.

308
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,201
So Catherine's introduction is actually outside the game

309
00:16:12,201 --> 00:16:13,422
in this case.

310
00:16:13,422 --> 00:16:15,343
Inciting incident.

311
00:16:15,343 --> 00:16:16,744
We all started in different places

312
00:16:16,744 --> 00:16:19,485
and we had to find each other using landmarks.

313
00:16:19,485 --> 00:16:22,247
So this is the moment her question is posed.

314
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:23,368
Will I connect with my friends?

315
00:16:25,973 --> 00:16:28,394
Complication one in the rising action.

316
00:16:28,394 --> 00:16:30,515
We first explored what this place was,

317
00:16:30,515 --> 00:16:32,876
a sense of the unknown.

318
00:16:32,876 --> 00:16:34,537
I don't remember having a tutorial,

319
00:16:34,537 --> 00:16:36,878
but I remember seeing nothing in my inventory.

320
00:16:36,878 --> 00:16:39,439
I spun around in a circle thinking, where am I?

321
00:16:39,439 --> 00:16:42,580
Then I thought, lush and green equals safe.

322
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,801
Snowy mountains equals harder.

323
00:16:43,801 --> 00:16:45,342
I should stay in the green area.

324
00:16:45,342 --> 00:16:47,923
So she wants to find her friends,

325
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:49,543
but she doesn't know the rules yet.

326
00:16:49,543 --> 00:16:51,224
Complication two.

327
00:16:52,484 --> 00:16:54,966
I found my friends and we wanted to build a fortress.

328
00:16:54,966 --> 00:16:55,887
First we built our own houses,

329
00:16:55,887 --> 00:16:58,969
but when a friend left, we built his for him.

330
00:16:58,969 --> 00:17:01,871
We made a huge fortress and incorporated our personalities.

331
00:17:01,871 --> 00:17:03,933
Someone put torches in a large staircase

332
00:17:03,933 --> 00:17:05,033
to make it look regal.

333
00:17:05,033 --> 00:17:07,835
First we used the resources that were there,

334
00:17:07,835 --> 00:17:09,717
but then I learned you can make anything.

335
00:17:09,717 --> 00:17:12,219
So I'd go get things and bring them back to safety.

336
00:17:12,219 --> 00:17:14,040
The goal was to build a house no matter what,

337
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,202
and it didn't hit me until nighttime that I could die.

338
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:16,662
Complication three.

339
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:24,992
That first night I was outside, I didn't realize there were creatures and I was not prepared.

340
00:17:24,992 --> 00:17:26,553
I just really wanted to make roofs.

341
00:17:26,553 --> 00:17:29,614
I think it was a skeleton shooting arrows.

342
00:17:29,614 --> 00:17:30,895
I was like, what is that?

343
00:17:30,895 --> 00:17:32,956
Then I died.

344
00:17:32,956 --> 00:17:36,017
I didn't make a bed, so I had to find my friends again.

345
00:17:36,017 --> 00:17:40,780
But I learned and made a bed, armor, and a weapon to fight with.

346
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:44,342
So while a different player might be focused on fighting and weapons, for

347
00:17:44,342 --> 00:17:46,323
Catherine, this was a means to an end.

348
00:17:46,323 --> 00:17:46,603
Climax.

349
00:17:50,086 --> 00:17:52,388
Then I learned you could set a house on fire,

350
00:17:52,388 --> 00:17:54,650
so we set our friends' houses on fire

351
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:58,073
and started the process all over again.

352
00:17:58,073 --> 00:17:59,974
So the reason I think this is the climax

353
00:17:59,974 --> 00:18:02,296
is it takes a certain level of friendship

354
00:18:02,296 --> 00:18:04,458
to grief your friend and get away with it.

355
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:11,324
So for Catherine, did I connect with my friends?

356
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:11,384
Yes!

357
00:18:11,384 --> 00:18:12,985
Well, I certainly hope so.

358
00:18:12,985 --> 00:18:16,148
And finally, the resolution.

359
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:21,622
I was focused on my main objective, which was a million ways to get stuff to build with.

360
00:18:21,622 --> 00:18:24,503
You learn to craft, and then there's color, materials.

361
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:28,044
I thought, now I want to build a purple house.

362
00:18:28,044 --> 00:18:29,144
This changes everything.

363
00:18:29,144 --> 00:18:30,544
I need wool.

364
00:18:30,544 --> 00:18:31,925
I need to dye wool.

365
00:18:31,925 --> 00:18:34,585
So this gives us a hint of what's to come.

366
00:18:34,585 --> 00:18:39,006
Catherine has built her friend community and now is going to master crafting.

367
00:18:39,006 --> 00:18:44,288
But the cool thing about Minecraft is this moment is not just the resolution.

368
00:18:44,288 --> 00:18:46,728
It's the inciting incident for another story.

369
00:18:50,133 --> 00:18:53,375
So you can see if we just take a top-down approach

370
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:55,816
to analyzing all the different player paths.

371
00:18:55,816 --> 00:18:57,797
Collectively, it looks like nonsense.

372
00:18:57,797 --> 00:19:02,000
But if we translate it into a familiar linear structure,

373
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,181
we can track the music of each player

374
00:19:04,181 --> 00:19:06,182
and plan to put things into the sandbox

375
00:19:06,182 --> 00:19:07,903
that satisfies each intrinsic drive.

376
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:11,605
Even though maybe the players redefine their story

377
00:19:11,605 --> 00:19:14,006
at some point, maybe player one is playing for a week,

378
00:19:14,006 --> 00:19:16,227
maybe player three is playing for three years,

379
00:19:16,227 --> 00:19:17,028
the rules are the same.

380
00:19:18,102 --> 00:19:23,223
What's different is that I am the protagonist.

381
00:19:23,223 --> 00:19:24,703
My story is the story.

382
00:19:24,703 --> 00:19:25,303
I ask the questions.

383
00:19:25,303 --> 00:19:31,825
So I promised you my theory on game design, and here it is.

384
00:19:31,825 --> 00:19:34,506
All games, from the most progressive

385
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:38,427
to the most emergent, follow linear structure.

386
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:41,848
However, we're not really talking

387
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:44,028
about a spectrum of story structure.

388
00:19:46,651 --> 00:19:48,211
We're talking about a spectrum of identity.

389
00:19:48,211 --> 00:19:53,533
When I talk about the main character, do I say they,

390
00:19:53,533 --> 00:19:54,553
or do I say I?

391
00:19:54,553 --> 00:19:58,475
The spectrum is what is so special about games.

392
00:19:58,475 --> 00:20:01,115
Though, even as I say that, the truth

393
00:20:01,115 --> 00:20:03,316
is most media are transitioning closer

394
00:20:03,316 --> 00:20:05,217
to the I end of the spectrum.

395
00:20:05,217 --> 00:20:06,217
We don't just watch videos.

396
00:20:06,217 --> 00:20:08,798
We comment and post and make it our own experience.

397
00:20:10,015 --> 00:20:14,516
So as our media diversifies, the ability to simplify the truth

398
00:20:14,516 --> 00:20:17,837
of human experience into something we can all analyze

399
00:20:17,837 --> 00:20:19,757
becomes more essential.

400
00:20:19,757 --> 00:20:24,418
So to tie this together, I begin by saying

401
00:20:24,418 --> 00:20:27,379
this approach is important because it, one,

402
00:20:27,379 --> 00:20:30,799
creates a tool for speaking directly to players' hearts,

403
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,740
and two, it acts as a common language

404
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,980
for multidisciplinary teams.

405
00:20:36,205 --> 00:20:38,688
So how do we begin to shift our language?

406
00:20:38,688 --> 00:20:42,531
How do we translate the micro of our separate disciplines,

407
00:20:42,531 --> 00:20:47,195
economies, systems, art, loops, into common ground?

408
00:20:47,195 --> 00:20:50,058
I think like most things in games, it's iterative.

409
00:20:50,058 --> 00:20:52,500
I've seen great leaders and peers with different styles.

410
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,343
One of my favorite examples is an analyst coming up

411
00:20:56,343 --> 00:21:00,307
with a way to look at which animals are players liked best

412
00:21:00,307 --> 00:21:03,249
based on the animal's cuddle-ability factor.

413
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:07,832
I thought that was such a great example of empathy for the player's story.

414
00:21:07,832 --> 00:21:14,855
It changes the question from, will I get a new animal to, will I get the most cuddleable

415
00:21:14,855 --> 00:21:19,497
animal ever, which is so simple and inspirational for everyone on the team.

416
00:21:19,497 --> 00:21:26,560
So how to shift language could be a session in and of itself, but if I could offer one

417
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,801
takeaway, it would be this moment.

418
00:21:31,537 --> 00:21:35,820
This idea of the ball, the shark, the client list,

419
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,101
the friendship.

420
00:21:37,101 --> 00:21:40,243
Because when you identify what a player is after,

421
00:21:40,243 --> 00:21:42,725
you can open that question up to a team.

422
00:21:42,725 --> 00:21:45,548
Will they get the ball in the end zone?

423
00:21:45,548 --> 00:21:46,869
Will he kill the shark?

424
00:21:46,869 --> 00:21:48,390
Will they get the client list?

425
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,711
Will I find my friends?

426
00:21:49,711 --> 00:21:52,753
The beautiful thing is that there are many paths

427
00:21:52,753 --> 00:21:53,814
to answer that question.

428
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:56,796
And the terrible thing is that there are many paths

429
00:21:56,796 --> 00:21:58,898
to answer that question, which is why people

430
00:21:58,898 --> 00:22:00,319
are so reluctant to pose it.

431
00:22:02,285 --> 00:22:05,687
But I read this article about diversity recently,

432
00:22:05,687 --> 00:22:09,209
and it argued that the strength of diversity in all its forms

433
00:22:09,209 --> 00:22:11,370
is not that we're kumbaya and we all get along.

434
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:11,830
No.

435
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:16,212
Humans are naturally distrustful of anything unlike us.

436
00:22:16,212 --> 00:22:19,574
So we question others' ideas, and they question us.

437
00:22:19,574 --> 00:22:22,716
So diversity demands critical thinking.

438
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:27,779
And critical thinking has never been more important,

439
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:30,961
nor has media or entertainment and the stories

440
00:22:30,961 --> 00:22:31,461
we choose to tell.

441
00:22:33,396 --> 00:22:37,518
If you can be ruthless in defining the question,

442
00:22:37,518 --> 00:22:41,100
but open in the path for solving for the answer,

443
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,301
you've created a shared starting place

444
00:22:43,301 --> 00:22:46,703
for a singular narrative with infinite possibilities.

445
00:22:46,703 --> 00:22:46,883
Thank you.
