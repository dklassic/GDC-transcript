00:00:07,643 --> 00:00:11,886
Hello, and welcome to the Indie Mega Booth GDC Flash Forward video.

2
00:00:12,886 --> 00:00:15,728
My name is Kelly Wallach, and I'll be your host for this video.

3
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:21,672
I'm the CEO and founder of Indie Mega Booth, and also the chairman of the IGF here at GDC.

4
00:00:23,193 --> 00:00:27,216
So in case you missed the news, Indie Mega Booth Showcase has doubled this year.

5
00:00:27,976 --> 00:00:32,019
So we're gonna have 24 totally amazing indie games for you to come and check out.

6
00:00:33,447 --> 00:00:34,648
We're in the same place that we've been.

7
00:00:35,129 --> 00:00:37,011
We're up on the third floor, Moscone West,

8
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:39,673
and we're open Monday through Friday to all badge holders.

9
00:00:40,534 --> 00:00:43,537
So Monday, Tuesday, we're going to have one set of 12 games.

10
00:00:44,317 --> 00:00:45,859
And then on Wednesday, we're going to switch it up

11
00:00:46,299 --> 00:00:48,421
to another set of 12 games that'll be there

12
00:00:48,461 --> 00:00:49,482
Wednesday through Friday.

13
00:00:51,504 --> 00:00:53,185
So by this point, you might be asking yourself,

14
00:00:53,406 --> 00:00:55,448
what in the world is the Indie Mega Booth?

15
00:00:56,449 --> 00:00:56,889
Don't worry.

16
00:00:57,089 --> 00:00:58,811
I also ask myself that sometimes, too.

17
00:01:00,139 --> 00:01:03,202
So, at its core, we're a showcase for independent game developers.

18
00:01:04,142 --> 00:01:06,824
But, over the last six years, it's grown into more than that.

19
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:11,508
It's an incredibly tight-knit community of developers who work together to help each other out.

20
00:01:12,553 --> 00:01:16,155
We also work really hard to connect up teams with folks who might want to work with them.

21
00:01:16,255 --> 00:01:19,118
So partners, sponsors, platform holders, publishers.

22
00:01:19,838 --> 00:01:22,600
In essence, it's a way to help gain a foothold into the games industry.

23
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,943
We started off as a relatively simple, but kind of crazy idea,

24
00:01:27,323 --> 00:01:31,606
to gather up a bunch of really cool games and developers and all work together.

25
00:01:32,367 --> 00:01:36,574
So at PAX East 2012, we ran the first ever Indie Megabooth Showcase.

26
00:01:37,015 --> 00:01:40,761
It had 12 developers, we were plopped in the middle of the show floor,

27
00:01:41,141 --> 00:01:46,129
and we had a bunch of confused people walking by, not totally sure what to make of all these small, independent games.

28
00:01:47,082 --> 00:01:53,906
But from there, we did one at PAX West, and we doubled our size, and then we did another one at PAX East, and we doubled our size again.

29
00:01:54,386 --> 00:02:00,510
Then, after that, we stopped doubling in size, because if we kept going at that rate, I think that we would be taking over the entire planet by now.

30
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:06,373
But, we did keep growing, and not only did we keep growing in size, but we kept growing in strength.

31
00:02:07,559 --> 00:02:13,642
We moved from being an all-volunteer effort to a full-fledged company, and suddenly I became a CEO.

32
00:02:14,542 --> 00:02:18,304
So we hired on another person, and we started doing shows outside of the U.S.

33
00:02:18,924 --> 00:02:23,846
We eventually started doing work with BitSummit, which is a premier indie festival located in Kyoto, Japan.

34
00:02:24,587 --> 00:02:28,628
And from there, we started to really build the foundation that is the community that you see today.

35
00:02:30,429 --> 00:02:32,590
So what makes our GDC showcase so special?

36
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:39,234
Well, one of the really cool things about this showcase for us is that we get to curate it in a way that's different from the other shows that we do.

37
00:02:40,235 --> 00:02:50,284
Normally, we're going to really big consumer-facing events, which is great and it's really fun, but since GDC is developer-focused, we get to pick games that we think other developers are going to find fun.

38
00:02:51,508 --> 00:02:55,070
Not only does it give a chance for other developers to discover something new,

39
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:59,473
talk to some upcoming developers, maybe get inspired to create or make something of their own,

40
00:02:59,953 --> 00:03:03,536
but the teams that we select for the showcase also get a chance to attend GDC,

41
00:03:03,636 --> 00:03:07,778
which is a super important way for them to be able to network and make more connections.

42
00:03:10,617 --> 00:03:13,899
Our developer lineup this year features games from 10 different countries.

43
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,882
We also have 8 titles that are going to be playable for the very first time,

44
00:03:18,342 --> 00:03:20,944
and 2 of them that were announced through our showcase reveal.

45
00:03:21,745 --> 00:03:26,208
On top of that, 13 games are going to have brand new content in some way, shape, or form.

46
00:03:26,868 --> 00:03:30,271
So, that means if you come by, you are definitely going to see something

47
00:03:30,351 --> 00:03:33,053
that you haven't seen before and that you can't see anywhere else.

48
00:03:33,894 --> 00:03:36,375
On top of that, you're going to get to meet some really cool folks.

49
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:40,798
And we have some pretty comfy couches, so you can sit down and take a load off,

50
00:03:41,098 --> 00:03:43,600
take a bit of a breather, and check out some really cool games.

51
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,182
If you'd like to find out more, you can go to IndieMegaBooth.com.
