1
00:00:04,511 --> 00:00:06,774
I'm Tyler Sigmund. I'm the co-founder, co-president,

2
00:00:06,814 --> 00:00:10,639
design director, trash man, I don't know, whatever. It's a

3
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:14,224
small company so we all do a lot of things. Red Hook Studios.

4
00:00:16,268 --> 00:00:18,110
when I was putting this talk together, so it's a post-mortem

5
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:19,851
we're going to try to cover things that went well, things

6
00:00:19,871 --> 00:00:22,893
that didn't go so well. But as putting the talk together in

7
00:00:22,933 --> 00:00:26,375
particular I think on what went wrong, I'm going to focus a lot

8
00:00:26,435 --> 00:00:29,517
on one thing, not because there is difficulty in finding lots of

9
00:00:29,657 --> 00:00:31,859
‑‑ there's no hubris in difficulty in finding lots of

10
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:33,860
things that went wrong. But I think there's just a couple

11
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,601
things that were more interesting. So hopefully

12
00:00:35,621 --> 00:00:38,983
you'll forgive it's not an exact standard 5 and 5 like the old

13
00:00:39,243 --> 00:00:40,204
GDMAG format.

14
00:00:42,462 --> 00:00:46,843
So darkest dungeon is a turn based gothic horror light

15
00:00:46,903 --> 00:00:50,164
fantasy RPG about the psychological stress of

16
00:00:50,224 --> 00:00:54,445
adventuring. And this is, we throw this screen up the minute

17
00:00:54,485 --> 00:00:57,026
you start up the game to make sure you know what you're

18
00:00:57,046 --> 00:00:58,846
getting into. And of course no one reads it because no one

19
00:00:58,866 --> 00:01:01,387
reads tutorials. But this gives us the ability to come back

20
00:01:01,427 --> 00:01:06,569
later and say we told you it was going to be bad. And this is

21
00:01:06,589 --> 00:01:07,609
what it looks like in practice.

22
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:20,346
Come on, healer. Come on, healer.

23
00:01:21,086 --> 00:01:22,367
Come on, healer.

24
00:01:23,308 --> 00:01:27,851
Baby, you gotta go.

25
00:01:27,871 --> 00:01:30,213
Survival is a tenuous proposition.

26
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:31,534
That's okay. Come on, healer.

27
00:01:31,554 --> 00:01:35,657
A sprawling tomb.

28
00:01:35,697 --> 00:01:37,398
Come on!

29
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,781
Healer! Healer!

30
00:01:53,941 --> 00:01:54,501
Come on!

31
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:56,622
Come on! Come on!

32
00:01:56,642 --> 00:02:04,464
That's fine as long as you give me one more fucking hit!

33
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,501
Find it in no short supply.

34
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:24,122
Don't do it!

35
00:02:24,423 --> 00:02:26,084
FUUUUUUUUUCK!

36
00:02:26,124 --> 00:02:27,905
FUUUUUUUUUCK!

37
00:02:28,825 --> 00:02:31,747
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!

38
00:02:34,268 --> 00:02:42,293
It is... timeless, after all.

39
00:02:42,313 --> 00:02:43,374
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!

40
00:02:43,394 --> 00:02:43,554
DOOM!

41
00:02:43,594 --> 00:02:45,175
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!

42
00:02:51,545 --> 00:02:58,186
So that's Ezekiel 3. He actually still likes us. And did play

43
00:02:58,206 --> 00:03:00,446
darkest dungeon after that and has actually played it since.

44
00:03:01,647 --> 00:03:05,567
And so, yeah, that's nice. So he has gotten some more enjoyment

45
00:03:05,587 --> 00:03:07,908
out of the game. One of the things we set out to do with

46
00:03:07,928 --> 00:03:10,608
darkest dungeon that made it unique is trying to create

47
00:03:10,628 --> 00:03:14,669
emotional attachment. So I think we succeeded. Sometimes maybe

48
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:17,730
not exactly in the ways that we planned. I mean, I wouldn't say

49
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,390
that was like one of our design goals.

50
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,822
but when we were coming up with the game idea, so Chris

51
00:03:24,842 --> 00:03:27,704
Brasso's, originally his idea, Chris and I were friends and we

52
00:03:27,744 --> 00:03:29,665
would get together and talk about working on games together.

53
00:03:29,705 --> 00:03:33,807
We had worked at other studios in the past. And this one kept

54
00:03:34,487 --> 00:03:36,228
‑‑ it had so much weight. Every time we would talk about

55
00:03:36,248 --> 00:03:39,630
it we would get excited. The main thing is we're RPG fans and

56
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,652
there's so many great RPGs out there. I've been playing them my

57
00:03:42,672 --> 00:03:44,413
whole life on and off the computer.

58
00:03:44,993 --> 00:03:46,834
and one of the things we were really conscious of is just

59
00:03:46,874 --> 00:03:50,736
that we didn't want to just make an RPG because we love them. We

60
00:03:50,776 --> 00:03:53,418
wanted to make an RPG only if there was something maybe

61
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,739
different or new that we could add that might make it stand

62
00:03:55,819 --> 00:04:00,842
out. And the real concept here is the idea of heroes are human.

63
00:04:01,082 --> 00:04:03,084
And Chris likes to say it's about the sword arm, not the

64
00:04:03,124 --> 00:04:06,506
sword. It's not how big your shoulder pads and giant glowing

65
00:04:06,566 --> 00:04:10,628
sword are. It's the human wielding it and how willing they

66
00:04:10,688 --> 00:04:12,069
are and able to fight.

67
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:16,142
And so along with that becomes the whole range of human

68
00:04:16,162 --> 00:04:20,325
emotion. So moments of despair, these uncomfortable decisions

69
00:04:20,365 --> 00:04:23,428
we're putting you in as the player, confronting you with

70
00:04:23,448 --> 00:04:27,331
loss and permanent consequences. But the real secret is we're not

71
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:31,275
actually sadists. The moments of despair are there only in so

72
00:04:31,295 --> 00:04:32,576
far as to create moments of triumph.

73
00:04:33,237 --> 00:04:37,078
because what is an act of true heroism without the possibility

74
00:04:37,098 --> 00:04:39,840
of cowardice. And we felt like a lot of RPGs are all about

75
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,881
heroism. You have one hit point, you're fighting the dragon,

76
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:44,842
whatever. Hang in there. Oops, didn't go well. Reload. Try

77
00:04:44,862 --> 00:04:49,044
again. A little bit about my background because it's relevant

78
00:04:49,064 --> 00:04:52,245
to what's next is I designed a bunch of games on and off the

79
00:04:52,285 --> 00:04:55,067
computer and a bunch of different genres. I like to say

80
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:57,308
every time I make a game I enjoy I have to do pendants and make a

81
00:04:57,368 --> 00:05:00,929
racing game, which I do not enjoy and am not particularly

82
00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:01,229
good at.

83
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:05,692
But I think that diverse range of just non collectible card

84
00:05:05,712 --> 00:05:11,657
games to weird hybrid action games to turn based really

85
00:05:11,677 --> 00:05:15,299
helped because darkest dungeon has a ton of systems in it. It's

86
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:17,741
a small game made by a small team. When you look at

87
00:05:17,761 --> 00:05:20,343
something like the witcher 3 it's ridiculous for me to say

88
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,224
there's this big scope to the game. But I think there was

89
00:05:22,284 --> 00:05:23,105
unexpected scope.

90
00:05:24,185 --> 00:05:26,486
The main pillars I guess you could say of the play experience

91
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:29,786
are this town, exploration, combat and camping. And we

92
00:05:29,806 --> 00:05:33,667
talked a lot up front about how much time should the player

93
00:05:33,707 --> 00:05:38,728
spend in each of these phases. Combat by far is I think, well,

94
00:05:38,768 --> 00:05:40,808
combat and exploration together are the lion's share of your

95
00:05:40,848 --> 00:05:44,029
time. But that's not to minimize the importance of the time you

96
00:05:44,049 --> 00:05:46,309
spend in camping. Or some people spend an awful lot of time in

97
00:05:46,349 --> 00:05:48,950
town looking at their things and putting their guys into

98
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:51,850
treatment. But generally you're walking side to side through a

99
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:52,770
hallway finding things.

100
00:05:54,827 --> 00:06:00,555
built around those four cores are a ton of systems. One of

101
00:06:00,595 --> 00:06:03,359
the challenges of the game was that a lot of these systems are

102
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:07,930
innovations, I guess, which is not trying to say that always

103
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:11,051
worked, but the affliction system was the real hook of the

104
00:06:11,091 --> 00:06:13,732
game. That was something, you know, it's like how do we

105
00:06:13,772 --> 00:06:18,033
psychologically model these heroes? Meanwhile, the cost of

106
00:06:18,073 --> 00:06:20,053
entry making an RPG, you still have to do all the other things,

107
00:06:20,273 --> 00:06:24,934
combat, leveling, quests, monsters, you know, all these

108
00:06:24,994 --> 00:06:27,235
sorts of things. And so when you start layering in affliction

109
00:06:27,255 --> 00:06:30,356
system and torch light, you know, some innovations, it was

110
00:06:30,376 --> 00:06:31,216
a lot at times. So...

111
00:06:32,385 --> 00:06:36,586
I think one thing that went well is that a lot of the systems

112
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:39,827
are not particularly eloquent. Some of them certainly deserve

113
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:43,729
a second pass, a third pass that maybe never got it. And some of

114
00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:48,390
them are outright clunky. But together it all worked. And

115
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:51,031
sometimes I guess I say it went well because it's just a great

116
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:56,035
side relief for me. It felt like at times any one system that

117
00:06:56,055 --> 00:06:59,258
didn't do its job was going to ruin the whole mix. Like you

118
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:03,542
over seasoning the stew. I can't recover it now. But I think in

119
00:07:03,562 --> 00:07:08,005
this case one of the things I'm just most proud of in the game

120
00:07:08,466 --> 00:07:11,208
is just that it did all hang together, duct tape and bailing

121
00:07:11,228 --> 00:07:14,791
wire and chewing gum and the whole bit to support the goal

122
00:07:14,831 --> 00:07:16,813
of the game which was heroes are human.

123
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:21,093
and part of that, too, it's really important what we didn't

124
00:07:21,133 --> 00:07:25,496
do. For all those systems that I just showed, there was a lot

125
00:07:25,536 --> 00:07:27,498
that we wanted to put in and these are just a couple of them.

126
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:32,682
Crafting or the idea of a more meaningful upgrade system, more

127
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:38,327
meaningful gear or loot system. The characters have this armor

128
00:07:38,347 --> 00:07:40,549
and weapon progression. It's just linear progression. You can

129
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:43,891
go from level 1 upgrade to level 5 in armor, level 1 to level 5

130
00:07:44,011 --> 00:07:47,294
in weapon. You have two trinket slots. And you can go from

131
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,435
course we could have done a whole bunch more. We could have

132
00:07:49,455 --> 00:07:53,218
done paper doll, et cetera, et cetera. But that would have

133
00:07:53,258 --> 00:07:55,861
taken away, especially with our team and with the budget we had

134
00:07:55,901 --> 00:07:59,044
set out to make the game with, if I was spending time on that,

135
00:07:59,064 --> 00:08:01,586
I wouldn't have been spending time on the system. And that

136
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:05,350
would have been a mistake. Similarly, and this was led

137
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:08,533
really strongly by Chris, the creative director, our focus on

138
00:08:08,553 --> 00:08:09,253
emergent narrative.

139
00:08:10,274 --> 00:08:13,535
meant that we weren't doing these other cost of entry RPG

140
00:08:13,575 --> 00:08:16,796
features like extensive dialogue trees, going into the abbey,

141
00:08:17,136 --> 00:08:19,557
talking to the abbot before you commit treatment. Hello, Mr.

142
00:08:19,637 --> 00:08:22,398
Abbott, what's new today? What rumors have you heard? None of

143
00:08:22,438 --> 00:08:25,079
that. The quests are not particularly in depth. They're

144
00:08:25,119 --> 00:08:29,100
kind of the equivalent of go get the ten wolf belts. And we

145
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,421
really avoided heavy lore at every possible opportunity. And

146
00:08:32,661 --> 00:08:36,323
that was a creative choice, but all these also support kind of

147
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:37,763
what we were trying to do. We

148
00:08:40,021 --> 00:08:43,682
you know, your ancestor called you to the estate and you need

149
00:08:43,722 --> 00:08:47,803
to go to the wield and fight things or the ruins. It's very

150
00:08:47,923 --> 00:08:50,964
archetypal, but in doing so, that means you have to

151
00:08:51,004 --> 00:08:53,265
construct a love story in your head. And ultimately what we

152
00:08:53,305 --> 00:08:56,506
wanted to do, what we're really after is the idea of kind of

153
00:08:56,526 --> 00:08:59,007
like these old roguelikes where you make your character and you

154
00:08:59,027 --> 00:09:01,667
go on these crazy adventures and then you can string together

155
00:09:01,687 --> 00:09:04,768
this story of like, well, that time with all the slugs in level

156
00:09:05,028 --> 00:09:07,609
10 was rough. I barely got out of that. Thank God I drank the

157
00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:09,550
random potion and polymorphed and got away.

158
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,692
wanted you to do that with the heroes. So the more we force fed

159
00:09:13,713 --> 00:09:16,054
down your throat, that wouldn't have worked. So it was very

160
00:09:16,074 --> 00:09:20,898
important for us not to do things. Our design process also

161
00:09:20,918 --> 00:09:21,278
went well.

162
00:09:22,414 --> 00:09:27,200
you're welcome. Chris, so, you know, I'm designer on the game,

163
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:30,023
design director, but there's a lot to do with this game and a

164
00:09:30,063 --> 00:09:33,867
lot of design and a lot came from Chris and I working

165
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:37,511
together very early. And this isn't always the role. I filled

166
00:09:37,551 --> 00:09:40,474
on every game. It's kind of funny. But in this game it very

167
00:09:40,494 --> 00:09:43,578
much became this role of Chris, you know, drawing all day long.

168
00:09:44,119 --> 00:09:45,940
and having time to think because he can draw and think at the

169
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,383
same time. I cannot spreadsheet and think about anything else

170
00:09:48,403 --> 00:09:52,067
at the same time. So we would just be spouting ideas. Not

171
00:09:52,387 --> 00:09:55,570
always spouting. He carefully thought of some. I kind of got

172
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:58,513
into this role of batting stuff back over the net.

173
00:10:00,055 --> 00:10:02,676
and then sometimes he really, really, really wanted to talk

174
00:10:02,716 --> 00:10:06,197
about it again, and I could sit with it and get comfortable

175
00:10:06,237 --> 00:10:09,618
where it might have gone. In fairness also my role in the

176
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:13,820
game was to wrangle these things and do the detail design.

177
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,881
Okay, afflictions, how does that work? How are we doing stress?

178
00:10:16,921 --> 00:10:18,882
What triggers an affliction? What kind of things can they do

179
00:10:18,922 --> 00:10:22,804
in the affliction? But kind of managing that whole cloud of red

180
00:10:22,844 --> 00:10:26,065
stuff was at times just completely maddening but also

181
00:10:26,105 --> 00:10:26,225
fun.

182
00:10:27,245 --> 00:10:29,027
the creative direction of the game having that established

183
00:10:29,047 --> 00:10:32,849
really strong up front was what we needed to be able to resist

184
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:35,611
that design feature creep. I think I'm a designer and it's

185
00:10:36,896 --> 00:10:39,097
we all make games and it's really hard sometimes. You wake

186
00:10:39,177 --> 00:10:41,077
up and have a shower and you think of this awesome thing

187
00:10:41,097 --> 00:10:43,418
you'd like to throw in and maybe it goes into the game and

188
00:10:43,598 --> 00:10:46,199
sometimes you've got to resist the temptation. And then also

189
00:10:46,219 --> 00:10:49,200
don't want to minimize the rest of the team as coming up with

190
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:52,061
great ideas, being there to reject something that is really

191
00:10:52,081 --> 00:10:57,642
bad that just doesn't fly. And sometimes it was hard because

192
00:10:57,862 --> 00:11:00,763
you can't listen to all ideas from all places, but the rest of

193
00:11:00,783 --> 00:11:03,724
the team was really important also with vetting and trying and

194
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:04,545
all sorts of these things.

195
00:11:05,939 --> 00:11:10,521
So the system is the hook of the game. And that's really what we

196
00:11:10,581 --> 00:11:13,443
call the whole system for your heroes being human and sometimes

197
00:11:13,623 --> 00:11:17,244
basically being a bunch of unruly toddlers. And that's

198
00:11:17,304 --> 00:11:20,046
built on events and situations. If you think about it, being an

199
00:11:20,086 --> 00:11:23,407
adventurer is a really, really terrible job. You might be

200
00:11:23,447 --> 00:11:26,449
running out of food. You're in search of this elusive gold. It's

201
00:11:26,469 --> 00:11:27,529
kind of like start-up culture.

202
00:11:29,573 --> 00:11:33,435
you're in the dark, running out of light, could die at any

203
00:11:33,475 --> 00:11:36,475
moment. So there's these events and situations that lead to

204
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:40,697
stress. And everyone loves to make fun of how you can read a

205
00:11:40,717 --> 00:11:42,697
book and it can just blow your mind in our game. But that's

206
00:11:42,717 --> 00:11:46,258
very Lovecraftian, to be fair. So stress builds on the heroes

207
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:49,019
once it reaches 100. We have what's called a resolve check.

208
00:11:49,619 --> 00:11:53,260
And that's a test of their mettle. And that resolves one of

209
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,981
two ways. If you're lucky, they become virtuous. Excuse me,

210
00:11:57,021 --> 00:11:57,781
like this courageous.

211
00:11:58,957 --> 00:12:01,420
but more often than not, they become afflicted.

212
00:12:03,002 --> 00:12:04,984
And then this manifests in their behaviors,

213
00:12:05,064 --> 00:12:06,766
in their stat bonuses or penalties,

214
00:12:07,147 --> 00:12:09,490
and narratively in the things they talk about.

215
00:12:11,825 --> 00:12:14,947
The inspiration for the affliction system was not games

216
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:19,310
really, although I have to show an image. It was more human

217
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:23,512
experience. That's fictional, dramatizations, movies, TV

218
00:12:23,532 --> 00:12:26,914
shows, et cetera, but also just life. Being a manager, we talk

219
00:12:26,934 --> 00:12:31,857
about a lot. Being in a relationship, all these things,

220
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:35,259
your human experience, it's pretty easy to mine that for how

221
00:12:35,299 --> 00:12:36,100
we react to stress.

222
00:12:37,281 --> 00:12:39,742
and that's a really important point is Darkest Dungeon is not

223
00:12:39,762 --> 00:12:42,704
a game about mental health or mental illness. Darkest Dungeon

224
00:12:42,744 --> 00:12:44,986
is a game about the human response to stress and those are

225
00:12:45,026 --> 00:12:48,488
very different things. So this is an image, I really like

226
00:12:48,508 --> 00:12:50,470
Band of Brothers Europe, obviously based on real events.

227
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,572
And there's this character, Buck Compton, I think that's his

228
00:12:53,612 --> 00:12:57,995
name, played by this actor, Neil McDonough. He's tall, he's

229
00:12:58,035 --> 00:13:01,137
handsome, he's tough. He's been on a bunch of missions. He's

230
00:13:01,177 --> 00:13:03,399
kind of just this gregarious energetic guy that's holding the

231
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:04,479
squad together in a way.

232
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,620
and they're in the battle of the Ardennes and getting shelled

233
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:10,421
through the winter and he watches a shell land in a fox

234
00:13:10,441 --> 00:13:13,002
hole with a couple of his buddies and they're just gone.

235
00:13:13,022 --> 00:13:15,183
They're there one minute, the shell lands, they're gone. And

236
00:13:15,363 --> 00:13:18,424
there's this great scene where he just comes up and he just has

237
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:21,185
the thousand yard stare, shell shock, takes off his helmet and

238
00:13:21,225 --> 00:13:24,986
he's just done. That's it. His war is over. And I think that

239
00:13:25,026 --> 00:13:27,787
was really a moment that in a way we wanted to capture.

240
00:13:29,467 --> 00:13:35,571
game over man. Hudson and his, he's the most boisterous. I

241
00:13:35,611 --> 00:13:37,752
love watching, especially extended cut, I think there's

242
00:13:37,772 --> 00:13:40,253
even more talking, him at the beginning just being total

243
00:13:40,293 --> 00:13:44,015
boisterous asshole. And then of course the minute things go to

244
00:13:44,055 --> 00:13:46,897
hell he can't handle it. And Ripley is the one civilian that

245
00:13:46,937 --> 00:13:50,378
shouldn't be able to handle it and is made of steel. But war

246
00:13:50,398 --> 00:13:52,640
games and things have done morale for a long time. And to

247
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,901
some degree what we were doing is bringing a morale system

248
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:56,242
into an RPG.

249
00:13:58,749 --> 00:14:00,890
And so these aren't necessarily new ideas. It's just kind of

250
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:03,891
maybe packaging them in a different way. The affliction

251
00:14:03,931 --> 00:14:08,194
system had seven afflictions, four virtues. And one of the

252
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:10,535
neat things is we have 15 different character classes in

253
00:14:10,575 --> 00:14:13,257
the game and we've got custom strings and multiple variants

254
00:14:13,297 --> 00:14:15,818
for every single class, every single affliction virtue, every

255
00:14:15,858 --> 00:14:18,280
single act out they can do. That's one of the things we

256
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,481
really invest a lot in and paying out. I think the game has

257
00:14:20,521 --> 00:14:24,043
about 70,000 words of text now. And that's funny for a lower

258
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:27,845
list game with no dialogue trees. So that snuck up on us.

259
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:32,268
if you play the game, they say it might be hard to see here.

260
00:14:32,308 --> 00:14:37,130
But here the hellions being masochistic. Please cut me. I

261
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:41,733
want this. Here I think the highwayman is being abusive and

262
00:14:41,753 --> 00:14:46,036
basically berating his party members. This is too hard to

263
00:14:46,056 --> 00:14:49,297
see. It's a little small. More of the same. Someone made some

264
00:14:49,357 --> 00:14:51,819
fan art which captures the feeling you get in the game a

265
00:14:51,859 --> 00:14:52,019
lot.

266
00:14:53,711 --> 00:14:56,111
can't read it, can you people hold your shit together and hit

267
00:14:56,151 --> 00:15:01,653
something for five minutes, please. That happens a lot. So

268
00:15:01,674 --> 00:15:03,534
the important thing about the affliction system is it's really

269
00:15:03,574 --> 00:15:07,496
the hook of the game. I mean, you know, the game is

270
00:15:07,556 --> 00:15:09,576
universally allotted for a lot of things, but this is kind of

271
00:15:09,656 --> 00:15:13,898
always there. If it didn't work, the whole game premise falls

272
00:15:13,938 --> 00:15:16,799
down. And it's built up of really pretty simple

273
00:15:16,859 --> 00:15:17,519
subsystems.

274
00:15:18,807 --> 00:15:22,090
and we purposefully obfuscate part of that. When your

275
00:15:22,511 --> 00:15:25,154
character is masochistic, we don't tell you what could

276
00:15:25,194 --> 00:15:27,617
happen. We don't tell you exactly what act outs they might

277
00:15:27,657 --> 00:15:31,561
do or how they might run to the front or reject healing. We want

278
00:15:31,581 --> 00:15:33,804
you to discover that through play. We don't want to have a

279
00:15:33,864 --> 00:15:36,367
tool tip or as much as I love tool tips, Chris knows I love

280
00:15:36,387 --> 00:15:36,707
tool tips.

281
00:15:38,449 --> 00:15:42,212
never met a tool tip I didn't love. But at the same point

282
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:45,655
here, we don't want to show you everything. We want you to

283
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:48,617
discover it. But it's really important, stress we could not.

284
00:15:48,777 --> 00:15:51,419
We thought about it. We toyed around with obfuscating stress.

285
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:54,241
But then we could have the characters talk as they're

286
00:15:54,261 --> 00:15:56,944
getting more stressed. But then you never really know where the

287
00:15:56,964 --> 00:15:59,706
breaking point is. And you can't make any tactical or strategic

288
00:15:59,726 --> 00:16:03,889
decisions of how far to press or what to do or when to camp.

289
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,590
if you don't know. So it actually worked out really well

290
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:09,111
to just make it like a health meter. We worried it would be a

291
00:16:09,151 --> 00:16:12,672
little boring, a little dry, but that certainly enhanced the game

292
00:16:12,693 --> 00:16:14,553
and certainly enhanced the systems. You know they're about

293
00:16:14,593 --> 00:16:18,374
to break. And that was really important. The system also

294
00:16:18,414 --> 00:16:20,675
features the loss of agency, which I'll talk about a little

295
00:16:20,695 --> 00:16:26,117
more. Yeah, it worked. I mean, that's why I say it's something

296
00:16:26,137 --> 00:16:28,618
that went well. And I think one of the biggest reinforcements to

297
00:16:28,658 --> 00:16:31,939
me that it worked was during early access, which we were in

298
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,759
for roughly a year.

299
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:37,241
we made very, very few changes to the affliction system. I

300
00:16:37,261 --> 00:16:40,283
mean frighteningly few. We thought we would go back and add

301
00:16:40,303 --> 00:16:43,225
a million more act outs and double back on some things that

302
00:16:43,265 --> 00:16:46,266
were really rough. And other than a little bit of tuning and

303
00:16:46,306 --> 00:16:49,448
maybe improving the flow of a few things like I think now if

304
00:16:49,468 --> 00:16:50,649
they bulk the heal, you go to heal.

305
00:16:50,669 --> 00:16:54,132
them and they balk. We don't penalize you your turn. They

306
00:16:54,172 --> 00:16:56,835
don't get to heal but you can still use that character. We

307
00:16:56,855 --> 00:16:59,937
made a couple changes like that but in general we didn't. And

308
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:03,000
the reason we didn't is because the community was very clear of

309
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,944
many other things that they didn't like. And I think that's

310
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,346
important though. The squeaky wheel gets to grease a little

311
00:17:09,366 --> 00:17:12,809
bit because this was working and I think it realized the potential

312
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:14,671
of what the affliction system was supposed to do.

313
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:19,570
As you've seen with the ZKL video, we successfully not only

314
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:22,293
made your heroes afflicted, we made the game players afflicted.

315
00:17:22,893 --> 00:17:25,796
How many of you have rage quit Darkest Dungeon? I don't know

316
00:17:25,816 --> 00:17:29,519
if I should ask this. How many of you rage quit but came back

317
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:33,223
and played again? Thank God. How many of you rage quit and are

318
00:17:33,243 --> 00:17:35,064
never going to play it again but still came to the talk anyway?

319
00:17:37,907 --> 00:17:39,348
Thank you for your honesty. That's it.

320
00:17:40,213 --> 00:17:42,795
Thank you for the honesty. I have met people who are like I

321
00:17:42,835 --> 00:17:45,417
like the game. I can never play it. I will never play it again.

322
00:17:46,178 --> 00:17:49,801
But it may help you a little bit in your hearts to know that we

323
00:17:49,941 --> 00:17:51,503
also made ourselves afflicted a lot.

324
00:17:53,412 --> 00:17:56,416
through development we developed a vernacular vocabulary for

325
00:17:56,476 --> 00:17:59,180
understanding how stress was impacting us. You should try it

326
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:03,866
on your teams. It works quite well. So we would see that, hey,

327
00:18:03,966 --> 00:18:06,189
maybe don't talk to them today. They're really close to

328
00:18:06,209 --> 00:18:10,355
afflicted. Or someone would send a nasty e-mail and we'd

329
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:14,117
get on the side. Don't worry. They're just abusive right now.

330
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:18,479
They'll get over it. And to put myself out there, my affliction

331
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:21,760
is a rationality. As my stress builds and builds and builds and

332
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:25,461
then I become triggered, then I'll pick some really stupid

333
00:18:25,501 --> 00:18:30,082
thing to just panic about. And maybe, you know, just, yeah,

334
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:32,843
coffee or I don't know what it is. Or make some small point

335
00:18:32,863 --> 00:18:35,144
about the game I want to fight tooth and nail about that's

336
00:18:35,204 --> 00:18:36,685
completely meaningless. So that's me.

337
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:41,577
little bit about this is just to show like this is what we call

338
00:18:41,597 --> 00:18:44,098
the trait library which is this is how the afflictions are

339
00:18:44,118 --> 00:18:47,059
actually hooked up. This isn't particularly sexy but what you

340
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:50,619
can see there and these slides will be on the vault later is

341
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:54,640
like a series of buffs to the stats and then situational act

342
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:58,241
outs is what we call them like hey, there's this chance of if

343
00:18:58,401 --> 00:19:00,762
it's your turn in combat and you're abusive you might do

344
00:19:00,782 --> 00:19:03,502
this or if it's a reaction act out, if someone tries to heal

345
00:19:03,522 --> 00:19:06,463
you and you're paranoid you may reject it because you think

346
00:19:06,483 --> 00:19:08,003
they're trying to kill you, that kind of stuff.

347
00:19:10,584 --> 00:19:13,825
And this brings me to one of my favorite things, the Microsoft

348
00:19:13,865 --> 00:19:19,706
Excel. And I think you were saying Ed Fries said hello. Ed

349
00:19:19,746 --> 00:19:22,487
Fries was head of Microsoft games. I like to think of him

350
00:19:22,687 --> 00:19:26,128
because he worked on Excel. That's his best accomplishment.

351
00:19:26,588 --> 00:19:28,768
So anyway, Excel is my favorite thing.

352
00:19:30,858 --> 00:19:36,122
Google sheets are for collaboration. I'll use it.

353
00:19:36,662 --> 00:19:40,125
Excel is the thing. Excel, when you're a small team, you need to

354
00:19:40,165 --> 00:19:43,248
figure out ways to move faster. And one of these sheets is

355
00:19:45,249 --> 00:19:49,350
the monster library, there's 200 monster files or something.

356
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:53,451
And that was really useful to automate that. And so usually

357
00:19:53,511 --> 00:19:55,512
things made their way from sprite sheet into a JSON or

358
00:19:55,532 --> 00:19:58,652
darkest. So it's not like we have the best pipeline ever. But

359
00:19:58,672 --> 00:20:01,913
the programmers were busy doing important things and making the

360
00:20:01,933 --> 00:20:05,134
game. But we had enough to get through. And so that's where I

361
00:20:05,154 --> 00:20:06,895
think the BBA exporters and things like this.

362
00:20:07,535 --> 00:20:11,137
we're so helpful, especially when you're a small team. So

363
00:20:11,157 --> 00:20:15,359
setting up these parametric equations so that you can decide

364
00:20:15,459 --> 00:20:17,300
all monsters in the whole game need a little more help and you

365
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,042
don't have to go through. I'm a big fan of formulas, obviously.

366
00:20:20,722 --> 00:20:22,723
So a lot of that went well, but there's definitely some gaps

367
00:20:22,803 --> 00:20:25,685
where we're missing key exporters that I always thought

368
00:20:25,865 --> 00:20:29,547
we'd find time to make and never did. So it became a little

369
00:20:29,587 --> 00:20:30,307
confusing working.

370
00:20:30,727 --> 00:20:33,610
with programmers. We make a change for a new feature. Is

371
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:36,373
this an exported file or a hand edited file? I don't know. I

372
00:20:36,413 --> 00:20:38,334
have to look through my 27,000 spreadsheets. So that sometimes

373
00:20:38,915 --> 00:20:39,676
led to problems.

374
00:20:43,607 --> 00:20:48,933
Something that went well is our bad design. So there's a few

375
00:20:48,993 --> 00:20:51,996
areas of bad design that I want to focus on. So loss of agency.

376
00:20:52,697 --> 00:20:55,499
That's one. So in other words, your characters do things that

377
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,143
you don't want them to do. They pass their turns, they reject

378
00:20:59,163 --> 00:21:01,966
healing, they basically just make your life difficult. In

379
00:21:02,006 --> 00:21:04,449
talking to my partner Chris, it does sound like maybe being a

380
00:21:04,509 --> 00:21:04,769
parent.

381
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:10,822
and, you know, or owning a pet. And that's kind of what they

382
00:21:10,922 --> 00:21:14,725
are. And generally that's bad design. Because, you know, you

383
00:21:14,745 --> 00:21:18,208
should get positive feedback for the actions you do, et cetera,

384
00:21:18,228 --> 00:21:20,690
et cetera. But it was very, very important for darkest dungeon

385
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:24,313
that you were not in control. That's really just like a

386
00:21:24,373 --> 00:21:26,735
founding principle. So even though we knew it frustrated the

387
00:21:26,755 --> 00:21:29,898
heck out of you sometimes, like in the Ezekiel video, it came to

388
00:21:30,078 --> 00:21:32,360
one of the characters' turns, I think they passed, and then of

389
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,462
course he lost the whole party wipe.

390
00:21:36,437 --> 00:21:41,232
But this was necessity from the heroes are human idea.

391
00:21:43,018 --> 00:21:45,259
this made it a little hard sometimes because it has a lot

392
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:47,740
of numbers and a lot of systems and it's kind of a tactics, it's

393
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:51,322
a turn-based combat game. Sometimes you're worried about

394
00:21:51,403 --> 00:21:55,565
balance like, hey, this character has like DPS is

395
00:21:56,085 --> 00:21:58,667
undersized by 5% compared to the other characters and you have

396
00:21:58,687 --> 00:22:01,268
this system in the game that basically can just rob you of a

397
00:22:01,308 --> 00:22:04,310
turn entirely. And that was sometimes a hard balance to

398
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:07,451
tread and to get people to expect. Because I think for some

399
00:22:07,471 --> 00:22:10,093
people they genuinely enjoy darkest dungeon as just

400
00:22:11,449 --> 00:22:13,431
it would be really cool if not for this affliction system that

401
00:22:13,451 --> 00:22:16,314
keeps getting in the way. It's a turn-based combat, cool

402
00:22:16,354 --> 00:22:19,358
roguelike, whatever. That was hard sometimes to balance.

403
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:23,022
Because ultimately there is all this kind of stuff that's taking

404
00:22:23,062 --> 00:22:23,803
control away from you.

405
00:22:26,548 --> 00:22:28,749
our save system. If you're familiar with the game, it

406
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:31,990
saves all the time. Actions are permanent. There's no save

407
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:34,911
scumming. You have to go through great lengths to do some save

408
00:22:34,931 --> 00:22:38,993
scumming. So permanent consequences were what we were

409
00:22:39,033 --> 00:22:42,174
after. We want you at all moments to be like, should I go

410
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,675
a little further, maybe get a little more treasure, do I think

411
00:22:44,715 --> 00:22:47,336
I can make it to the end of this quest even though these two

412
00:22:47,356 --> 00:22:50,737
characters are afflicted and this one is almost dead? And to

413
00:22:50,777 --> 00:22:55,179
do that, we needed this terrible save system that is just really,

414
00:22:55,219 --> 00:22:55,599
really mean.

415
00:22:57,199 --> 00:23:01,902
and it's exceptionally mean because in Ezekiel's video, he

416
00:23:01,962 --> 00:23:04,283
crashed out of the game and I guess he calmed down the next

417
00:23:04,323 --> 00:23:07,825
day and came back to play, booted it up and it had saved

418
00:23:07,905 --> 00:23:11,587
right before the hit that killed his characters because he crashed

419
00:23:11,667 --> 00:23:15,909
out. But it had already rolled and the action was fixed. So he

420
00:23:15,949 --> 00:23:19,131
was like, okay, we're going to do this. He had to watch it

421
00:23:19,151 --> 00:23:22,553
happen again. So that wasn't intentional.

422
00:23:23,513 --> 00:23:27,537
We did not make a use case for you crashing your computer and

423
00:23:27,617 --> 00:23:33,563
out. 15 unbalanced hero classes. So we chose to do more heroes

424
00:23:33,603 --> 00:23:39,108
rather than less. And sometimes the cost of that was balance and

425
00:23:39,148 --> 00:23:42,331
attention to each individual hero. But it was a conscious

426
00:23:42,371 --> 00:23:44,894
choice because every hero you add to the game gives you the

427
00:23:44,914 --> 00:23:47,076
ability for more party formations. And

428
00:23:49,014 --> 00:23:51,675
more interesting things. We always thought of heroes as loot.

429
00:23:51,695 --> 00:23:54,317
When you go to the stage coach, it should be exciting when you

430
00:23:54,337 --> 00:23:57,299
are waiting for a crusader and a crusader shows up. When you are

431
00:23:57,319 --> 00:24:00,141
waiting for a grave robber and a grave robber shows up. It's

432
00:24:00,161 --> 00:24:03,883
funny to watch people tweet about this. Full disclosure,

433
00:24:03,903 --> 00:24:06,305
there's no crazy systems in that we detect what you want and we

434
00:24:06,325 --> 00:24:07,466
don't give it to you or anything like that.

435
00:24:09,265 --> 00:24:12,848
people are like, I'm 20 weeks in and I haven't seen a god damn

436
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:17,393
alien. So yeah, that's just roll of the dice. But it should be

437
00:24:17,473 --> 00:24:20,436
sort of exciting when you really desperately need another plague

438
00:24:20,476 --> 00:24:24,560
doctor because you lost one from your A team and you need to

439
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,101
bring one back.

440
00:24:27,737 --> 00:24:30,479
We made the conscious choice, though, of not to try to

441
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:34,201
balance them all. This is to varying degrees of success. But

442
00:24:34,982 --> 00:24:37,524
it wasn't just because it would be difficult. We actually

443
00:24:37,584 --> 00:24:40,566
wanted it to feel a little spiky. Like first edition D&D.

444
00:24:40,666 --> 00:24:45,069
It's crazy. Monks and magic users are basically just like

445
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:47,291
babies in radio flyers that you have to pull around for the

446
00:24:47,331 --> 00:24:47,971
first couple levels.

447
00:24:48,952 --> 00:24:51,354
But then by the time they get to level 12 it's crazy. They're

448
00:24:51,394 --> 00:24:56,618
wiping out entire armies. I think that spikiness is fun.

449
00:24:56,678 --> 00:24:59,460
Sometimes there's a crusade to balance the hell out of your

450
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,181
game. If it's a multiplayer, yes. If it's a single player

451
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:12,231
don't like high women as much. It's not a critical issue. We

452
00:25:12,391 --> 00:25:14,854
even had conflict in the team on this. There were times that

453
00:25:15,215 --> 00:25:17,037
people would bring these things to me and I'm just like I'm

454
00:25:17,077 --> 00:25:19,460
really not worried about that problem right now. I think it

455
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,442
was hard for people to understand but it was a

456
00:25:21,522 --> 00:25:24,786
conscious choice of I'm worried about the system right now or

457
00:25:24,806 --> 00:25:26,648
I'm worried about something else not the high women's DPS.

458
00:25:28,865 --> 00:25:30,746
And also I think something that's forgotten is that

459
00:25:30,847 --> 00:25:33,648
characters are the sum of their entire usage throughout the

460
00:25:33,688 --> 00:25:37,050
game. In particular combat and camping. And so a lot of times

461
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:39,892
again to reference DPS we like this character's DPS is too low.

462
00:25:41,767 --> 00:25:44,228
about their camping skills? What about their versatility? What

463
00:25:44,268 --> 00:25:47,850
about their range of skills and where they can be positioned in

464
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:50,511
the party and things like that. And there were plenty of times

465
00:25:50,571 --> 00:25:52,732
where a character was underpowered across the board

466
00:25:53,292 --> 00:25:57,194
and not intentionally. And so we did that early access was great

467
00:25:57,214 --> 00:26:00,256
for that. But I think a lot of times people look at the

468
00:26:00,296 --> 00:26:03,917
immediate usage of something and not kind of the entirety.

469
00:26:08,017 --> 00:26:10,860
Another thing that was really bad about what we did, but good,

470
00:26:11,481 --> 00:26:18,086
was everybody's favorite lord and savior, RNGesus. We have a

471
00:26:18,127 --> 00:26:22,651
lot of RNGesus in the game. A lot of variance. A lot of

472
00:26:22,691 --> 00:26:27,655
variance. Intentionally so, which is not always great. But

473
00:26:29,011 --> 00:26:31,312
If you make all the right choices in darkest dungeon, you

474
00:26:31,372 --> 00:26:35,333
plan, you assemble a great team, you're experienced, you pick

475
00:26:35,353 --> 00:26:39,534
the right quest, you et cetera, et cetera. We want you still to

476
00:26:39,574 --> 00:26:42,715
get your ass kicked sometimes basically. Now, I want to be

477
00:26:42,755 --> 00:26:45,276
clear, we don't have an AI director system, so similar to

478
00:26:45,336 --> 00:26:47,256
us talking about the stage coach. We don't have something

479
00:26:47,276 --> 00:26:49,357
that detects you're doing well and then we swoop in and make

480
00:26:49,377 --> 00:26:52,718
it harder for you. We just rely on the beauty of RNGs and

481
00:26:52,738 --> 00:26:55,098
variants. The darkest dungeon is poker.

482
00:26:55,639 --> 00:26:59,422
poker, everyone has bad beats in poker if you play poker. And

483
00:26:59,762 --> 00:27:02,244
oddly enough, everyone's bad beat story is exactly the same.

484
00:27:02,284 --> 00:27:04,846
It's just told differently. I was winning. I should have won.

485
00:27:04,866 --> 00:27:08,309
I didn't. And we want you to experience those in darkest

486
00:27:08,349 --> 00:27:11,132
dungeon. We don't want to ‑‑ like the tuning part, the

487
00:27:11,152 --> 00:27:15,875
craftsmanship, the design is how often. How often do we want you

488
00:27:15,896 --> 00:27:18,237
to experience that two thirds of the time? No. If you prepared

489
00:27:18,278 --> 00:27:19,799
and planned and took the right party group into the right

490
00:27:19,819 --> 00:27:20,900
dungeon, you're going to get the best of both worlds.

491
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:25,306
and provisioned appropriately and didn't grab every bookcase

492
00:27:25,366 --> 00:27:29,331
and iron maiden if you didn't have the right stuff for it. You

493
00:27:29,351 --> 00:27:31,314
should do well. But every once in a while.

494
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:35,342
things go badly. And we want to put you in that uncomfortable

495
00:27:35,382 --> 00:27:38,985
space of I should be winning right now. This is getting away

496
00:27:39,045 --> 00:27:43,928
from me. Do I run? Do I abandon? Do I change my plan or do I hang

497
00:27:43,988 --> 00:27:46,990
in here and push through? And there's a couple of ‑‑ this

498
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:49,571
can go a variety of different ways. Maybe you make that gut

499
00:27:49,592 --> 00:27:52,053
check and you hang in there and you win and that should be a

500
00:27:52,093 --> 00:27:56,396
moment that you love the game. You should also applaud yourself

501
00:27:56,476 --> 00:27:59,258
for having the self-control to retreat and go back to town and

502
00:27:59,618 --> 00:28:01,079
lick your wounds. And I think that's a good thing.

503
00:28:02,259 --> 00:28:04,461
it's hard to communicate that. That's why we put that first

504
00:28:04,501 --> 00:28:06,443
screen up when I showed you darkest dungeon is about making

505
00:28:06,463 --> 00:28:09,426
the most of a bad situation. We're conditioned to play where

506
00:28:09,647 --> 00:28:11,669
you expect success. Especially in the last few years with

507
00:28:11,709 --> 00:28:14,792
mobile games and things. You expect success. It's really just

508
00:28:14,832 --> 00:28:16,954
a matter of solving the problem to get there. If you don't have

509
00:28:16,994 --> 00:28:19,877
success, you reload and try and try again until you get there.

510
00:28:20,638 --> 00:28:23,240
and we fundamentally wanted to change that. And sometimes I

511
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:26,502
think it's hard to communicate that to players that they'll buy

512
00:28:26,522 --> 00:28:28,564
the game and then this will happen. It's just like what have

513
00:28:28,584 --> 00:28:32,627
I gotten into? And the game is not intended for everyone. And

514
00:28:32,947 --> 00:28:36,610
that's something that I think went well but it also caused us

515
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:41,033
an amount of grief as well. Another thing that, you know,

516
00:28:42,245 --> 00:28:45,287
on my role of just doing things that you shouldn't do.

517
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:49,049
You know, in our final boss, I'm going to show a little bit from the final boss.

518
00:28:49,089 --> 00:28:50,410
So if you don't want to see it, cover your eyes.

519
00:28:51,291 --> 00:28:52,632
If you're still working your way through the game.

520
00:28:52,652 --> 00:28:55,653
And I'm personally not...

521
00:28:55,914 --> 00:28:56,674
I'm sorry.

522
00:28:56,714 --> 00:28:57,074
I'm sorry.

523
00:28:57,174 --> 00:28:57,595
Explain it.

524
00:28:57,775 --> 00:29:04,098
Father and mother, Alpha and Omega,

525
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,480
our creator and our destroyer.

526
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,041
You are the heart of the world.

527
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:13,899
I'm being cautious.

528
00:29:13,939 --> 00:29:17,082
I'll start the deal anyway.

529
00:29:17,943 --> 00:29:19,104
Come on to your maker.

530
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:24,550
What?

531
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:34,920
What?

532
00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:53,308
What do you want me to do?

533
00:29:53,348 --> 00:29:58,695
Do I have to choose one?

534
00:29:58,715 --> 00:29:59,817
Wait, I have to choose one and kill him?

535
00:30:16,058 --> 00:30:19,119
So, yes, we did just completely kill a character that had

536
00:30:19,179 --> 00:30:22,380
raised to level 6 with no death's door, no nothing. We

537
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:26,522
just took them away. By that time you probably put, I don't

538
00:30:26,542 --> 00:30:28,443
know, 10 hours in that character, maybe a little more,

539
00:30:28,563 --> 00:30:32,985
who knows. Actually, if it was Rain Oliver Dismas, that's all

540
00:30:33,005 --> 00:30:35,886
the more meaningful. The tutorial characters, of course.

541
00:30:36,806 --> 00:30:39,927
So, yeah, that's a terrible design decision. That's a rage

542
00:30:39,987 --> 00:30:41,288
inducing thing.

543
00:30:43,172 --> 00:30:45,233
but we're so happy we did it. We couldn't be happier actually.

544
00:30:45,513 --> 00:30:48,075
Anyway, there's a whole, I don't know if you got a chance to see

545
00:30:48,115 --> 00:30:50,136
Chris's talk yesterday on the creative direction of the game.

546
00:30:50,156 --> 00:30:52,638
But that was really important in paying off this cosmic horror

547
00:30:52,678 --> 00:30:55,460
and the overall narrative. And when that goes up on the ball,

548
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,581
I encourage you to check that out. He'll talk more about that

549
00:30:57,621 --> 00:31:01,364
battle. But we wanted you to experience that final battle in

550
00:31:01,404 --> 00:31:04,226
a specific way. And darkest dungeon has been about lost the

551
00:31:04,246 --> 00:31:07,568
whole time. And so, yeah, we're a little cheap and we make you

552
00:31:07,668 --> 00:31:10,870
remember that even more during the final battle.

553
00:31:14,215 --> 00:31:16,637
I'm going to get a little faster through some of these so we can

554
00:31:16,677 --> 00:31:18,918
go through. Another thing that was pointed out very often to

555
00:31:18,998 --> 00:31:21,359
us of a poor design here was healing versus damage. The

556
00:31:21,399 --> 00:31:25,781
healing does not keep the amount of healing, the numerical values

557
00:31:25,821 --> 00:31:30,003
do not keep pace with the amount of damage you receive. And

558
00:31:31,166 --> 00:31:35,350
that was repeatedly reminded to us. And we're like, awesome, by

559
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:39,433
design. So the quests are a battle of attrition. The longer

560
00:31:39,473 --> 00:31:41,675
you go, eventually your character should die and become

561
00:31:41,735 --> 00:31:44,218
afflicted and stress out. And the whole game is about

562
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:47,746
can you get to the end of the quest before that happens or

563
00:31:47,826 --> 00:31:50,268
how much loss are you willing to stomach. If this is your

564
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:53,591
favorite character, are you going to gold breaking it or

565
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:56,573
whatever where people always want their guys fully healed,

566
00:31:56,914 --> 00:31:59,716
don't want to make any risk. So you could get one third in a

567
00:31:59,736 --> 00:32:01,858
dungeon and be like screw this, I'm out. Whereas other people

568
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:03,740
are like I'm willing to lose two heroes to get through this.

569
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:06,262
Even Ezekiel, when he lost that third hero,

570
00:32:06,862 --> 00:32:09,143
he held it together pretty well. He knew he was trying to kill

571
00:32:09,183 --> 00:32:12,364
a necromancer and it was worth sacrificing characters. He only

572
00:32:12,404 --> 00:32:15,105
lost it when double death blow at the end which to be fair I

573
00:32:15,746 --> 00:32:18,967
think would do it to anybody. One of the things that worked

574
00:32:18,987 --> 00:32:23,989
really well in the game is just breaking some rules. You know,

575
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:26,470
the save one is the one I always come back to. The way I love to

576
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:28,951
play games, I like permissive save systems. Who are you to

577
00:32:28,991 --> 00:32:31,331
tell me how I should and shouldn't save my game?

578
00:32:32,468 --> 00:32:35,070
but when we talked about darkest dungeon we realized that would

579
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:37,432
not work. It would rob the player of the experience that we

580
00:32:37,472 --> 00:32:41,015
intend them to have. That was an interesting thing to be

581
00:32:41,416 --> 00:32:43,838
advocating and fighting for something that you don't even

582
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:46,760
agree with normally. You agree with it for this game. I think

583
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,762
that's a really important point. You should never lose sight that

584
00:32:48,782 --> 00:32:52,125
you are designing for that game, not all games or rules of thumb

585
00:32:52,185 --> 00:32:55,248
or make sure you never do this. So break the rules.

586
00:32:58,411 --> 00:33:01,073
kind of hustled through this. Combat is interesting. We

587
00:33:01,093 --> 00:33:03,854
didn't end up at this exact orientation initially. We were

588
00:33:03,874 --> 00:33:08,057
going to do kind of an ultimate style top down maybe 2D at

589
00:33:08,077 --> 00:33:10,498
least. That's what I was really interested in at first. We were

590
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:13,841
very inspired by this classic age. I think you can see the DNA

591
00:33:13,881 --> 00:33:16,422
in the old bard's tail. The first four characters can attack

592
00:33:16,462 --> 00:33:19,324
in melee. The next characters can attack in range. I think you

593
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:23,186
see that in our system and the positional requirements in some

594
00:33:23,226 --> 00:33:25,528
classes are definitely more geared towards melee attacks

595
00:33:26,028 --> 00:33:26,368
than others.

596
00:33:27,209 --> 00:33:29,309
this is a little more the art side but the gold box games

597
00:33:29,409 --> 00:33:32,390
pull radiance. I know we talked about how effective it was. They

598
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:35,872
just had an idle and an attack. They sit there and they just go

599
00:33:37,472 --> 00:33:40,913
and not to undersell the amazing freaking art that these guys

600
00:33:40,933 --> 00:33:45,775
did. But we're not a game that's fully animated with all these

601
00:33:45,835 --> 00:33:49,776
crazy key prints. They made the most of kind of a light amount

602
00:33:49,857 --> 00:33:53,478
of assets. A ton of work I will add before they kill me.

603
00:33:55,618 --> 00:33:58,800
They're eyeing me right now. It makes me nervous. We did a lot

604
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:01,922
of visual prototyping. This is something that worked well

605
00:34:02,062 --> 00:34:04,384
working with Chris. This sometimes saved us having to

606
00:34:04,564 --> 00:34:07,566
code things up or make things and try them. He would sketch

607
00:34:07,586 --> 00:34:10,007
stuff out. We would talk about the system, kind of mock up what

608
00:34:10,027 --> 00:34:12,789
it might look like, find the holes in that. I think that was

609
00:34:12,829 --> 00:34:15,370
helpful. Here's an example of realizing, hey, not only with

610
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:17,652
this new system and the slots, but we can have characters that

611
00:34:17,692 --> 00:34:17,972
are bigger.

612
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:22,794
he was working out what poses might be required, trying to

613
00:34:22,834 --> 00:34:27,201
figure out tool tips, which is I think at one point I was

614
00:34:27,882 --> 00:34:30,526
nicknaming tool tip or something. I don't know. It

615
00:34:30,546 --> 00:34:33,571
ended up like this. I think combat is something that has

616
00:34:33,751 --> 00:34:34,633
really served the game well.

617
00:34:35,612 --> 00:34:37,973
probably one of the biggest unknowns of combat for me was

618
00:34:38,774 --> 00:34:42,355
will there be enough depth in this 1D system. And it was

619
00:34:42,375 --> 00:34:44,936
still something, honestly, I fought even up through the last

620
00:34:45,017 --> 00:34:47,438
dungeon, the cove. It was starting to get like, okay, how

621
00:34:47,458 --> 00:34:50,519
many more weird moves can I think of or status effects or

622
00:34:50,539 --> 00:34:54,081
ways to pay off this. But it held together and I think there

623
00:34:54,121 --> 00:34:56,222
was definitely enough depth to pay it off. So that was good.

624
00:34:58,495 --> 00:35:00,735
and in particular I think one subsystem of death's door that

625
00:35:00,755 --> 00:35:04,476
was effective was this, or of combat, excuse me, was death's

626
00:35:04,536 --> 00:35:07,956
door. And this didn't start in there. We were playing combat

627
00:35:08,156 --> 00:35:11,057
and as you might imagine without the death's door mechanic, so

628
00:35:11,097 --> 00:35:12,797
the death's door mechanic essentially means you can't be

629
00:35:12,817 --> 00:35:15,138
killed in one blow. So without death's door you might be

630
00:35:15,178 --> 00:35:17,218
sitting at two-thirds health, someone gets a crit, your

631
00:35:17,358 --> 00:35:20,258
character is dead. And with permadeath that's crazy. You

632
00:35:20,298 --> 00:35:22,819
can never be safe. Even at full health you can never be safe.

633
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:26,179
And we didn't want it like that. Because then that robs you of

634
00:35:26,319 --> 00:35:26,580
all the...

635
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,820
you're either tense all the time or you're never tense because

636
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,721
you're just like we're all already dead so what does it

637
00:35:31,741 --> 00:35:35,682
matter. So in this case, a damaging attack, the most it can

638
00:35:35,702 --> 00:35:39,262
do is reduce you to death's door and then you have potentially a

639
00:35:39,302 --> 00:35:44,124
chance to heal or do something to that character before they

640
00:35:44,144 --> 00:35:47,744
die. Now, you can still die, obviously, because sequences of

641
00:35:47,804 --> 00:35:51,965
events, you might not get a turn in between, your hero may be

642
00:35:52,005 --> 00:35:54,426
afflicted, the character you're trying to heal may be afflicted,

643
00:35:54,926 --> 00:35:56,446
etc. You may have not brought healers.

644
00:35:57,827 --> 00:36:01,211
so there's plenty of death. But this door, I think it's like for

645
00:36:01,272 --> 00:36:04,496
such a simple system it's been so effective in raising

646
00:36:04,556 --> 00:36:07,159
attention. I love those moments where your character goes to

647
00:36:07,179 --> 00:36:09,462
death's door and you're nervous and you're confronted with the

648
00:36:09,502 --> 00:36:13,207
law, should I retreat, should I try to heal. And that's worked

649
00:36:13,227 --> 00:36:13,648
out really well.

650
00:36:15,037 --> 00:36:20,439
narration is huge. We brought this narrator in for our

651
00:36:20,459 --> 00:36:22,640
announcement trailer. I don't think at that point we thought

652
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,621
about using one in the game. But he was so amazing. Chris found

653
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:29,423
these lovecraft audio books read by Wayne June. We contacted him

654
00:36:29,523 --> 00:36:31,644
and got him to read for a trailer. And it was just like,

655
00:36:31,784 --> 00:36:33,905
okay, we have to put him in the game. There's a lot of

656
00:36:34,705 --> 00:36:39,006
no way we can't. A little side tidbit is Red Hook is named

657
00:36:39,066 --> 00:36:44,628
after the story. We're not in Brooklyn. I wish I would have

658
00:36:44,648 --> 00:36:47,668
thought of that before. We're right next to each other. We're

659
00:36:47,688 --> 00:36:50,189
in Vancouver. But we just thought Red Hook sounded cool.

660
00:36:50,569 --> 00:36:55,730
It's kind of a classic story of power and corruption. Not maybe

661
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:58,871
the best in terms of Lovecraft's cultural sensitivities. So in

662
00:36:58,911 --> 00:37:01,652
retrospect we feel bad for naming it after that story. But

663
00:37:01,772 --> 00:37:02,912
Red Hook sounds cool. So...

664
00:37:05,317 --> 00:37:08,139
it's really, yeah, just this quote, the narrator has done so

665
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:12,663
much and by remarkability I mean just virality of the game,

666
00:37:12,683 --> 00:37:15,645
people talking about it and things like that aside from its

667
00:37:15,685 --> 00:37:19,168
quality. And this happens all the time. It's crazy. You post a

668
00:37:19,188 --> 00:37:22,170
trailer and it will just be strings of comments of the

669
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:26,454
narrator lines. Or a Reddit post or Twitch channels and that's

670
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:29,296
really fun to see. Even pop in places that aren't darkest

671
00:37:29,336 --> 00:37:31,018
dungeons someone will say one thing and it will just go.

672
00:37:32,299 --> 00:37:35,462
and audio as a whole worked really well. This is a design

673
00:37:35,502 --> 00:37:38,225
talk but the reason I want to mention it is it reinforces the

674
00:37:38,265 --> 00:37:41,768
gameplay experience. If any of you do play racing games without

675
00:37:41,808 --> 00:37:45,392
the sound on, I don't understand you because I think they're a

676
00:37:45,432 --> 00:37:48,495
lot more fun with the sound on. And it's not just enhancing the

677
00:37:49,396 --> 00:37:53,680
experience, it's enhancing the game design, which I'm grateful

678
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:53,840
for.

679
00:37:55,696 --> 00:37:58,578
narration here is just, this is where I started to block out

680
00:37:58,619 --> 00:38:00,860
like where should he speak, what should he talk about, what

681
00:38:00,901 --> 00:38:04,824
kinds of things should he say. And just wanted to play a couple

682
00:38:04,844 --> 00:38:12,571
lines. The human mind, fragile like a robin's egg. There can be

683
00:38:12,611 --> 00:38:22,079
no hope in this hell. No hope at all. Grievous injury, palpable

684
00:38:22,339 --> 00:38:22,659
fear.

685
00:38:25,959 --> 00:38:30,633
More dust, more ashes, more disappointment.

686
00:38:33,572 --> 00:38:37,634
On that note of disappointment, it's a good time to switch into

687
00:38:37,674 --> 00:38:40,496
the other side of the talk. On the narration side, I want to

688
00:38:40,516 --> 00:38:42,617
say Wayne is awesome, power up master the lines and did the

689
00:38:42,677 --> 00:38:45,319
effects. Chris and I did writing. Chris did most of the

690
00:38:45,339 --> 00:38:49,321
writing and some of the lines are just really fun to see. I

691
00:38:49,861 --> 00:38:51,582
think even recently someone is like where is the trinkets and

692
00:38:51,622 --> 00:38:53,723
bobbles line. I haven't heard that in a while. I don't know.

693
00:38:53,763 --> 00:38:55,945
It's like a bug. But someone remembered the line so well they

694
00:38:55,985 --> 00:38:57,085
were very upset it wasn't playing.

695
00:38:58,806 --> 00:39:05,051
it. I think for a gimme one time, Wayne had other joke

696
00:39:05,071 --> 00:39:09,213
lines for each of us and it was really fun. He's got that voice

697
00:39:09,233 --> 00:39:13,176
that sticks out. But yes, disappointment. How many of you

698
00:39:13,236 --> 00:39:14,077
are familiar with the corpse?

699
00:39:16,258 --> 00:39:19,380
the great corpse event. Okay, not that many. Okay. That's

700
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:23,622
good. So we pushed this during early access, we pushed this

701
00:39:23,963 --> 00:39:26,804
amazing patch called the hound and corpse. Or corpse and hound

702
00:39:26,824 --> 00:39:29,766
or I don't know. It had all kinds of awesome stuff. The

703
00:39:29,806 --> 00:39:33,428
hound master, sanitary features like new and awful diseases.

704
00:39:34,929 --> 00:39:37,971
Steam cloud save, which is kind of cool. But not as cool as

705
00:39:37,991 --> 00:39:40,692
diseases. Corpses in combat. We were so excited about it. It was

706
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:41,293
even a bullet point.

707
00:39:44,186 --> 00:39:46,867
going to be a little relevant here. But if you remember the

708
00:39:46,887 --> 00:39:50,089
end of the dark night where basically things start going

709
00:39:50,129 --> 00:39:54,070
poorly for Batman. Batman takes a lot of blame for some things.

710
00:39:55,671 --> 00:39:58,192
Leading up to the corpse and hound. So we launched early

711
00:39:58,272 --> 00:40:00,093
access on February 3rd of last year.

712
00:40:01,112 --> 00:40:06,357
and it did far better than we thought it was going to do. We

713
00:40:06,377 --> 00:40:10,260
were launching into a climate of early access really being looked

714
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:13,603
down upon. There had been some high profile maybe

715
00:40:13,643 --> 00:40:17,807
disappointments and there was even this whole early access is

716
00:40:17,847 --> 00:40:21,170
dead. Everyone likes to proclaim the death of the next thing. So

717
00:40:22,151 --> 00:40:24,793
early access is dead and we're like, okay, we're about to

718
00:40:24,833 --> 00:40:25,074
launch.

719
00:40:29,796 --> 00:40:32,037
we launched into that environment. We put our best

720
00:40:32,077 --> 00:40:34,498
foot forward. We delayed because in the fall we wanted to launch

721
00:40:34,538 --> 00:40:37,639
early access. It wasn't ready. We delayed. We were running

722
00:40:37,739 --> 00:40:42,760
extremely thin on our personal runways. We kind of had to

723
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,902
launch there. We had no idea it was going to be received so well

724
00:40:47,102 --> 00:40:50,983
to be honest. I think you could ask, actually Kier. Kier thought

725
00:40:51,003 --> 00:40:52,664
it was going to be received well. The rest of us were

726
00:40:52,704 --> 00:40:57,285
nervous as hell. A month later my dad died.

727
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:02,835
So I went from the highest high of my professional life, no

728
00:41:02,875 --> 00:41:06,380
question, to the lowest low of my personal life. I'm grateful

729
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:09,404
he got to see the launch. I got to share with him how that was

730
00:41:09,444 --> 00:41:13,390
going. But when you're a small team, you know, and

731
00:41:15,286 --> 00:41:18,527
any one discipline that is taken out of action, your whole team

732
00:41:18,987 --> 00:41:23,008
is derailed. I mean, everybody is not taken out of action, but

733
00:41:23,028 --> 00:41:25,449
how are you going to push a patch that incorporates all

734
00:41:25,509 --> 00:41:28,590
disciplines when one person is out of action? This is my dad

735
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:34,692
in his natural environment. So we had planned this fiends

736
00:41:34,732 --> 00:41:38,173
infringing patch, which was our first real big non-support

737
00:41:38,233 --> 00:41:41,074
update. And originally it was probably going to try to go in

738
00:41:41,254 --> 00:41:43,755
March or April, but that didn't happen. I was kind of out of

739
00:41:43,775 --> 00:41:44,455
commission for a while.

740
00:41:45,658 --> 00:41:50,003
And so we pushed it in May and it was received pretty well, I

741
00:41:50,023 --> 00:41:54,188
think. Yeah, and things have been just rolling, you know. So

742
00:41:54,208 --> 00:41:56,330
the corpse and hound was really our first time. Because the

743
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:59,874
fiends and frenzy had been preplanned in a way. And aside

744
00:41:59,894 --> 00:42:04,039
from some game play tweaks, it was sort of preloaded. And the

745
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:06,762
corpse and hound was the first chance to really like collect

746
00:42:07,963 --> 00:42:10,864
collect info from the community and step back and go what game

747
00:42:10,904 --> 00:42:13,225
systems are not working, what's not working the way we want,

748
00:42:13,265 --> 00:42:16,666
what can we do? And one of the things, it technically wasn't in

749
00:42:16,706 --> 00:42:19,927
the corpse and hound, it came in fiends and frenzy was around

750
00:42:19,947 --> 00:42:22,708
that time was heart attacks. So what happened is the players

751
00:42:22,728 --> 00:42:24,468
that were getting good at the game could do these dark runs,

752
00:42:24,769 --> 00:42:27,890
they would basically push their team to full affliction and they

753
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:31,171
realized that the afflictions were not incapacitating so far

754
00:42:31,211 --> 00:42:33,371
that your team couldn't function. And so they just

755
00:42:33,411 --> 00:42:35,572
stopped caring about stress or torchlight or anything and they

756
00:42:35,592 --> 00:42:35,952
would just go...

757
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:39,052
they would just go run these people through. And that

758
00:42:39,092 --> 00:42:40,933
definitely wasn't the feeling we want with darkest dungeon. We

759
00:42:40,953 --> 00:42:45,337
want you to always feel in a precarious situation. And so the

760
00:42:45,357 --> 00:42:48,058
heart attack system came into play which basically was at 100

761
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:51,401
you have your affliction check and then that resolves. But

762
00:42:51,481 --> 00:42:53,843
stress continues to build. You have a little bit of a shock

763
00:42:53,883 --> 00:42:56,965
absorber there. But if you get to 200, and this is a smiley

764
00:42:56,985 --> 00:42:58,826
face, you're dead. No warning.

765
00:43:00,971 --> 00:43:04,053
It filled a very important role in terms of what we were trying

766
00:43:04,073 --> 00:43:06,874
to get you to experience. And at the time, actually, there was a

767
00:43:06,934 --> 00:43:10,956
little bit of like, oh, this is a little rough, but not outcry.

768
00:43:12,057 --> 00:43:14,018
So then in the corpse and hound we did corpses, which was

769
00:43:15,779 --> 00:43:18,459
was very important too. So what you see here in this screen

770
00:43:18,499 --> 00:43:21,861
image is a corpse in the front there. And so there had been a

771
00:43:21,901 --> 00:43:26,162
dominant strategy, the table saw strategy, which is focus fire

772
00:43:26,322 --> 00:43:30,104
everything on the first enemy, take them out and then that

773
00:43:30,144 --> 00:43:33,925
collapses everybody forward. And the enemies in back, generally

774
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:36,866
they just like heroes had skill prerequisites. So if you're an

775
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:38,987
archer in the back, you get collapsed forward, you can't

776
00:43:39,107 --> 00:43:42,968
use your attack. And so the way that we've been able to

777
00:43:44,169 --> 00:43:47,311
it was just too strong to focus fire on the front and it kind of

778
00:43:47,351 --> 00:43:50,533
reduced the rest of our combat system to maybe irrelevance in

779
00:43:50,573 --> 00:43:53,635
terms of like positioning, ranged attacks, debuffs, buffs,

780
00:43:53,715 --> 00:43:56,878
et cetera. So the corpse is the way they work. You kill the

781
00:43:56,918 --> 00:43:59,700
enemy. They leave a corpse. It remains there. They hold their

782
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:02,722
formation. They don't collapse forward. And the corpse will

783
00:44:02,742 --> 00:44:05,003
eventually go away or you can spend some extra actions or

784
00:44:05,043 --> 00:44:08,666
resources to eliminate it. And this enhanced, this did a lot of

785
00:44:08,686 --> 00:44:11,948
things. It fixed the dominant strategy. It enhanced the

786
00:44:11,988 --> 00:44:13,129
combat systems that we had built.

787
00:44:14,307 --> 00:44:16,649
and we thought it did so thematically. We didn't

788
00:44:16,789 --> 00:44:19,851
implement it up to our usual standard and that's partially

789
00:44:19,951 --> 00:44:23,314
for reasons I'll get to in terms of like usually we try to blow

790
00:44:23,334 --> 00:44:26,637
you away visually and this was no fault of the artist. It was a

791
00:44:26,697 --> 00:44:29,679
game play experiment in a way so every corpse looked the same. We

792
00:44:29,719 --> 00:44:32,341
didn't have custom corpses per enemy and things like that. And

793
00:44:32,401 --> 00:44:35,524
also we had thought of a lot of other ideas or at least I had in

794
00:44:35,564 --> 00:44:38,386
terms of we could buff up the front rank melee enemies to

795
00:44:38,406 --> 00:44:41,569
generally be a lot tougher, these sorts of things. So it was

796
00:44:41,589 --> 00:44:42,890
better than the other design options.

797
00:44:44,246 --> 00:44:46,387
Oh, yeah. Well, I thought people were going to love it.

798
00:44:47,307 --> 00:44:52,169
They lost their minds. It's really hard to overstate how

799
00:44:52,209 --> 00:44:55,331
much they lost their minds. It's definitely, I mean, at least

800
00:44:55,351 --> 00:44:57,212
for me, but I think Chris would agree it's the hardest thing

801
00:44:57,232 --> 00:44:59,633
we've had to deal with on the game. And we've had a lot of

802
00:44:59,673 --> 00:45:01,714
challenges on the game. And hardest probably just

803
00:45:01,794 --> 00:45:02,234
emotionally.

804
00:45:06,159 --> 00:45:08,841
it splintered our community which had been big and growing

805
00:45:08,881 --> 00:45:12,643
and excited and generally really we had had it very, very good.

806
00:45:12,703 --> 00:45:15,085
It was very positive. Everything had been received well

807
00:45:15,125 --> 00:45:17,826
generally and people were kind of patiently waiting for us to

808
00:45:17,846 --> 00:45:21,128
plug some holes in the game. It created this changing wave of

809
00:45:21,168 --> 00:45:24,611
sentiment and it was an easily told story, this promising game

810
00:45:24,671 --> 00:45:30,754
gone bad. That wasn't fun to look at steam and look at the

811
00:45:30,774 --> 00:45:33,156
helpful reviews and see literally four pages of nothing

812
00:45:33,196 --> 00:45:33,636
but negative.

813
00:45:35,681 --> 00:45:38,462
this is a whole story in itself but this also coincided with

814
00:45:38,882 --> 00:45:41,262
people that were not just unhappy that we added this into

815
00:45:41,302 --> 00:45:44,763
the game but that decided that we were basically the most

816
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:47,683
terrible people on the face of the planet and remain to believe

817
00:45:47,723 --> 00:45:52,384
that way today. And I think this narrative versus truth was hard

818
00:45:52,424 --> 00:45:55,405
for us because what I mean by that is people who played the

819
00:45:55,445 --> 00:45:59,186
game and said I don't like the corpses, we respect that

820
00:45:59,226 --> 00:46:02,206
opinion. People are like, I heard they ruined the game.

821
00:46:03,235 --> 00:46:06,337
you know, it's like, well, where did you hear that from? That

822
00:46:06,357 --> 00:46:10,079
was tough because we were also, you know, still continuing to

823
00:46:10,099 --> 00:46:12,381
develop the game and we have been excited by how well the

824
00:46:12,421 --> 00:46:17,284
game has been received. This patch launched in July and I

825
00:46:17,324 --> 00:46:20,547
remember thinking, you know, people are going to grouse a

826
00:46:20,567 --> 00:46:22,248
little bit. It's a big change but then they'll get used to it.

827
00:46:22,928 --> 00:46:25,550
And I was in Colorado so my father had been cremated and

828
00:46:25,570 --> 00:46:28,592
went back to Colorado where we're from to intern him and,

829
00:46:28,612 --> 00:46:29,973
you know, be with family, et cetera.

830
00:46:31,234 --> 00:46:33,614
a few months later after you died. And I remember it was

831
00:46:33,654 --> 00:46:35,955
either the night before we were going to bury him or the night

832
00:46:36,015 --> 00:46:38,936
after. Chris calls me up and we're having this talk and he's

833
00:46:38,976 --> 00:46:41,957
like, it's getting really bad. I don't know what to say. They're

834
00:46:41,997 --> 00:46:45,138
not getting used to it. They're starting, you know, the

835
00:46:45,178 --> 00:46:48,559
community is blowing up. It was a tough time.

836
00:46:51,933 --> 00:46:54,635
and this is one way to illustrate it. In July we were

837
00:46:54,655 --> 00:46:57,177
really lucky to have a very popular website that serves a

838
00:46:57,237 --> 00:46:59,698
lot of gamers that are exactly the sort of gamers that we want

839
00:46:59,719 --> 00:47:04,022
to reach. They put us in this top 50 RPGs of all time. These

840
00:47:04,102 --> 00:47:07,484
are games like Ultima are on there. And it was a huge honor.

841
00:47:07,504 --> 00:47:10,066
This is the only early access game that's even on this list.

842
00:47:10,686 --> 00:47:13,969
And this was just like, yeah, it was hard to overstate our

843
00:47:13,989 --> 00:47:16,451
excitement of that. That was July. And we pushed the corpse

844
00:47:16,491 --> 00:47:20,073
and hound patch. This was August from the same publication.

845
00:47:23,478 --> 00:47:26,460
So with, you know, I'm fully afflicted at this point for

846
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:31,542
sure. Just pegged at like 190 stress and we didn't have our

847
00:47:31,563 --> 00:47:33,644
death door mechanic and heart attack thing yet so that was

848
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:38,186
rough. And I kept hinging on these three words, a sad fate.

849
00:47:38,226 --> 00:47:40,207
I mean, when I read that, something just clicked in my

850
00:47:40,247 --> 00:47:43,909
head, you know, that just, it was just hard to even

851
00:47:44,249 --> 00:47:46,590
comprehend. Because we're still in early access.

852
00:47:47,427 --> 00:47:49,969
and we have been this example of an early access game done

853
00:47:50,029 --> 00:47:53,371
right. And now basically we're being left for dead on the

854
00:47:53,391 --> 00:47:57,053
roadside. They took this great game and they drove it into a

855
00:47:57,113 --> 00:48:01,996
concrete pillar. And I couldn't get over fate. We're still

856
00:48:02,056 --> 00:48:05,037
working on the game here. And this fundamentally changed my

857
00:48:05,097 --> 00:48:07,959
view of early access. I'm super pro early access for the record.

858
00:48:08,059 --> 00:48:11,361
I would happily do it again. I think we're just, we know more

859
00:48:11,401 --> 00:48:13,002
what to expect. But...

860
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:16,711
I thought early access would be a time to experiment with

861
00:48:16,731 --> 00:48:20,973
gameplay mechanics. And I don't know that that's really true.

862
00:48:23,134 --> 00:48:25,596
Especially if your game is already working. If your game is

863
00:48:25,616 --> 00:48:28,217
not working, I think you have the onus, you need to improve

864
00:48:28,237 --> 00:48:31,459
it. But massive changes to people that have already bought

865
00:48:31,499 --> 00:48:34,620
your game, it's a thorny problem. It's even ethical. They

866
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:38,142
paid for the game. Now you're changing it. That's hard.

867
00:48:40,719 --> 00:48:44,005
So Chris and I spent a lot of time talking, a lot of time

868
00:48:44,025 --> 00:48:47,913
talking, a lot of Google Hangouts, some drinking, some

869
00:48:47,933 --> 00:48:51,079
pity parties, some anger, the full range of emotions.

870
00:48:52,655 --> 00:48:55,938
and what it always came down to is did we do the right thing.

871
00:48:55,978 --> 00:48:59,141
And I remember just thinking like, okay, guys just lay it on

872
00:48:59,361 --> 00:49:02,464
me. Was this a horrible mistake? Because corpses were my idea

873
00:49:02,504 --> 00:49:06,007
and I had sold it up through the team. Just tell me I don't care

874
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:08,789
I'll eat crow, whatever it is. I just want to make the game

875
00:49:08,829 --> 00:49:12,172
right. And I was losing my ability to see objectively. So

876
00:49:12,192 --> 00:49:14,394
it was great because Chris and I spent a lot of time switching

877
00:49:14,434 --> 00:49:17,257
positions, devil's advocate, all these discussions about what to

878
00:49:17,277 --> 00:49:17,377
do.

879
00:49:19,073 --> 00:49:20,739
mean while we have this community management crisis.

880
00:49:20,779 --> 00:49:24,011
It's not like we have time to do this calmly, et cetera.

881
00:49:26,031 --> 00:49:28,993
And one thing that was also relevant is just the psychology

882
00:49:29,033 --> 00:49:32,815
of change. I mean, in other organizations it's a whole field

883
00:49:32,835 --> 00:49:35,957
of study, change management. Some of you may be familiar.

884
00:49:36,017 --> 00:49:38,519
People don't like change. Who moved my cheese and all that.

885
00:49:39,159 --> 00:49:43,262
And not to throw a team member under the bus, but one thing

886
00:49:43,282 --> 00:49:46,884
that had been in my mind before we did this change is that

887
00:49:46,904 --> 00:49:49,986
combat had been working and Chris and Pierre worked to add

888
00:49:50,006 --> 00:49:53,008
this combat camera which fakes it to look like 3D if you

889
00:49:53,048 --> 00:49:54,989
notice in the game that...

890
00:49:57,467 --> 00:50:01,034
like 3D. I remember putting in and one of the guys on the team

891
00:50:01,074 --> 00:50:04,421
said I think this is verbatim this is the worst thing I have

892
00:50:04,441 --> 00:50:05,242
seen in my entire life.

893
00:50:06,873 --> 00:50:09,854
a week later, two weeks later, this is cool. So I thought that

894
00:50:09,874 --> 00:50:13,595
would happen with corpses. The long story short, and I got to

895
00:50:13,635 --> 00:50:16,996
hustle because I wanted to leave a little time for Q and A, is

896
00:50:17,036 --> 00:50:20,757
that we decided it was right for the game. It was the right

897
00:50:21,057 --> 00:50:23,717
mechanical decision, it was the right thematic decision. We

898
00:50:23,757 --> 00:50:27,458
stood by it. That's, of course, a hard decision to make and we

899
00:50:27,498 --> 00:50:30,639
respect the opinions of people that disagree. So we're in this

900
00:50:30,659 --> 00:50:33,340
weird dilemma of do we remove this and make what we consider a

901
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:34,800
worse game to make people happy?

902
00:50:37,058 --> 00:50:40,381
and this is something that got us through the next six months.

903
00:50:40,541 --> 00:50:42,543
We're going to hurry through here. But Chris kept bringing

904
00:50:42,723 --> 00:50:45,246
it up. Things had gone so well for us, to be honest. It's like

905
00:50:45,546 --> 00:50:49,610
at some point you're going to make a mistake. You have to

906
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:54,314
fall off the peg. And this was hard. I say fast forward six

907
00:50:54,354 --> 00:50:56,776
months, but the last six months up until launching January was

908
00:50:57,477 --> 00:51:00,340
pretty rough. We're sitting here and going is the final story on

909
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:02,882
darkest dungeon going to be a promising game that was ruined?

910
00:51:03,343 --> 00:51:06,225
and living with that uncertainty I think is instructive just

911
00:51:06,286 --> 00:51:09,629
because you think we'd be riding high on the early access to sex.

912
00:51:09,709 --> 00:51:13,232
No, we're riding low on what's the legacy of the game going to

913
00:51:13,252 --> 00:51:15,735
be. Fast forward I think an interesting part of change

914
00:51:15,775 --> 00:51:18,818
management is ultimately the changes were received well and

915
00:51:18,838 --> 00:51:21,721
even people that had expressed concern in July when they

916
00:51:21,761 --> 00:51:25,024
reviewed the game, they're like, I see why they did this. So

917
00:51:25,064 --> 00:51:25,725
that was good.

918
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:29,122
What got us through is just holding to that creative vision

919
00:51:29,742 --> 00:51:32,144
and investing in more community management. These are things we

920
00:51:32,184 --> 00:51:34,306
did wrong. We didn't invest in community management up front.

921
00:51:35,026 --> 00:51:37,608
We were too precious about how to present the game to people

922
00:51:37,648 --> 00:51:40,230
and forced our way of playing it down their throats so we added

923
00:51:40,270 --> 00:51:43,993
toggle options. I think that's something we needed to do and we

924
00:51:44,033 --> 00:51:48,856
learned from this experience. And it also reminded us that we

925
00:51:48,876 --> 00:51:51,498
always said DD is not a game for everyone. And this reminded us

926
00:51:51,538 --> 00:51:52,299
that that was the case.

927
00:51:53,607 --> 00:51:57,573
So that's the key learning about early access. Content is always

928
00:51:57,633 --> 00:52:00,377
good. I think that, you know, sustainable game play changes,

929
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:02,079
you want to have community management in place. You want

930
00:52:02,099 --> 00:52:04,263
to warn them of the changes. We do this better now. Hey, this is

931
00:52:04,303 --> 00:52:06,546
coming down the line. Just be aware of this. What do you think

932
00:52:06,586 --> 00:52:09,490
about this? We push it in a beta branch. Let people try it out.

933
00:52:10,711 --> 00:52:13,452
that was stuff we really learned. A few other things I'm

934
00:52:13,472 --> 00:52:15,813
going to skip through and leave a couple minutes for questions.

935
00:52:16,554 --> 00:52:19,215
The bold points are what I want to emphasize. Other things, we

936
00:52:19,235 --> 00:52:21,636
have a lot of grind in the game. We didn't even add the end game

937
00:52:21,656 --> 00:52:24,096
until full launch so we didn't get the benefit of tuning that

938
00:52:24,116 --> 00:52:26,577
through early access so we're doing that tuning now. And

939
00:52:26,878 --> 00:52:28,958
certainly I think one of the things we've been repeatedly

940
00:52:28,998 --> 00:52:33,620
deemed on is this grind. We like a consequence but losing your

941
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:36,982
full level 6 heroes and having to rebuild, it just causes some

942
00:52:37,002 --> 00:52:38,102
people to just throw the game away.

943
00:52:38,582 --> 00:52:41,404
we don't want that. So we've been doing some things to help

944
00:52:41,444 --> 00:52:45,566
with those. Exploration was a really tough design mechanic. I

945
00:52:45,646 --> 00:52:49,107
still believe we haven't totally paid off the walking and the

946
00:52:49,167 --> 00:52:52,949
quests and the curios. In particular the game started, it

947
00:52:52,989 --> 00:52:55,791
was this auto walk. They kind of walked down the hall and things

948
00:52:55,831 --> 00:52:58,552
happened. It was terrible. And we almost were going to

949
00:52:58,572 --> 00:53:01,914
restructure all of exploration. When we made it active, it just

950
00:53:01,934 --> 00:53:04,255
made it so much better. So that was something that we spent a

951
00:53:04,295 --> 00:53:05,776
lot of time spending our wheels on.

952
00:53:07,076 --> 00:53:09,279
everybody's favorite mechanic hunger. It's not that we can't

953
00:53:09,299 --> 00:53:12,181
improve it. It's just that we're, you know, it did enough

954
00:53:12,241 --> 00:53:14,303
and after the corpse thing, quite frankly, if we make a

955
00:53:14,323 --> 00:53:15,665
hunger system and it's worse, oh, man.

956
00:53:18,969 --> 00:53:26,195
event card and something happened. One of them is this

957
00:53:26,235 --> 00:53:28,577
jostled free. It's like, hey, you're walking down the hallway

958
00:53:28,617 --> 00:53:33,121
and something falls out of your pack. And it just, can you

959
00:53:33,141 --> 00:53:36,544
imagine the rage? You're nice trinket just took it away

960
00:53:36,604 --> 00:53:41,248
randomly. This was really good because it brought up what we

961
00:53:41,288 --> 00:53:42,349
call the jostled free rule.

962
00:53:43,736 --> 00:53:47,925
is, you know, we do a lot to you, but don't arbitrarily with

963
00:53:48,026 --> 00:53:51,574
no, you know, another way of saying it is this.

964
00:53:57,009 --> 00:54:01,192
never fully, it's like go get the 20 wolf pelts. There's a lot

965
00:54:01,232 --> 00:54:03,274
of stuff that we could have done. I'm going to skip right

966
00:54:03,294 --> 00:54:04,515
through here because I want to have a couple of minutes for

967
00:54:04,535 --> 00:54:07,197
questions. In the end fortunately the dungeon isn't

968
00:54:07,237 --> 00:54:09,458
too dark. Here's some of the stuff. I want to say about

969
00:54:09,498 --> 00:54:12,301
retention, we didn't design with retention in mind, but the

970
00:54:12,341 --> 00:54:14,703
interesting thing about it is just that it's a sign of do

971
00:54:14,723 --> 00:54:17,745
people come back and play more. And that's important to us. When

972
00:54:17,765 --> 00:54:19,726
you played it and started it, you come back the next day

973
00:54:19,747 --> 00:54:21,768
because you want to play again. And that mobile, you know,

974
00:54:23,189 --> 00:54:27,430
PC, whatever, that's hugely important. More than all those

975
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:30,171
things is we feel like we made the game we set out to make and

976
00:54:30,211 --> 00:54:34,252
that feels good. We're ready to live or die by that vision. And

977
00:54:34,652 --> 00:54:37,113
I'm really, you know, we're incredibly grateful that people

978
00:54:37,133 --> 00:54:39,534
have enjoyed it. A little bit about what's coming. We're not

979
00:54:39,554 --> 00:54:42,075
done. We're still pushing some features. We're coming to other

980
00:54:42,095 --> 00:54:46,956
platforms. We're going to enable modders, stuff like that. And

981
00:54:47,196 --> 00:54:48,556
this is news to even the Red Hook team.

982
00:54:49,765 --> 00:54:52,187
today I'm happy to announce game number two from Red Hook

983
00:54:52,208 --> 00:55:07,861
Studios, brightest kittens. All right. We have a couple minutes

984
00:55:07,881 --> 00:55:11,064
for questions and then afterwards we'll move out and

985
00:55:11,084 --> 00:55:12,665
we'll probably get kicked out in a minute. We have five minutes.

986
00:55:12,766 --> 00:55:13,106
Okay. Great.

987
00:55:15,084 --> 00:55:19,685
What time period does the game take place in? We narrowly

988
00:55:19,725 --> 00:55:22,266
refined the time period to roughly 500 A.D. to 1800 A.D.

989
00:55:22,286 --> 00:55:24,886
You have the hellion which is almost a Pictish barbarian on up

990
00:55:24,906 --> 00:55:27,727
to the highwayman with his little scarf and pistols.

991
00:55:37,569 --> 00:55:41,172
that's kind of part of our lore. We wanted it, or the crusader

992
00:55:41,192 --> 00:55:43,813
and his heavy metal armor all the way up to the musketeer. So

993
00:55:43,913 --> 00:55:47,015
yeah, we purposefully kind of have created this alternate

994
00:55:47,055 --> 00:55:48,756
universe that isn't super defined there.

995
00:55:50,514 --> 00:55:53,516
can you speak to the level clamping that was done where the

996
00:55:53,556 --> 00:55:56,418
high level characters are no longer able to go on the low

997
00:55:56,458 --> 00:55:58,479
level journeys and what reinforced that decision?

998
00:55:58,699 --> 00:56:02,781
Yeah, sure. So what he's talking about is basically as your

999
00:56:02,801 --> 00:56:05,443
characters level up we prevent you from taking them on lower

1000
00:56:05,463 --> 00:56:10,065
level quests and power leveling your younger heroes. It's not

1001
00:56:10,105 --> 00:56:13,167
super popular all the time. But the bottom line is if you can do

1002
00:56:13,207 --> 00:56:15,268
that, the game is robbed of its tension.

1003
00:56:16,069 --> 00:56:18,930
and this is kind of like maybe something that isn't incredibly

1004
00:56:18,990 --> 00:56:20,650
eloquent from a design perspective. We're kind of

1005
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:23,631
hitting you on the head with a hammer. But it was absolutely

1006
00:56:23,771 --> 00:56:27,893
critical to make sure that we keep you in this risk thing. So

1007
00:56:27,913 --> 00:56:31,394
we loosely justify it and say, you know, as they level up, they

1008
00:56:31,434 --> 00:56:33,455
get big heads and they're like, I don't want to waste my time

1009
00:56:33,495 --> 00:56:36,796
down in your, you know, you're the FNGs, you guys go on your

1010
00:56:36,816 --> 00:56:38,897
mission. I'm sticking with the experienced guys. I think even

1011
00:56:38,957 --> 00:56:40,337
Band of Brothers had kind of a cool thing like that where

1012
00:56:40,377 --> 00:56:41,958
they're like, you know, you're the FNGs, you guys go on your

1013
00:56:42,898 --> 00:56:45,320
as they progress, they're just like, the new recruits come,

1014
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,081
don't talk to them, they're new. If they live through a couple

1015
00:56:47,101 --> 00:56:50,003
of missions, we'll talk to them. But we're not able to express

1016
00:56:50,043 --> 00:56:53,025
that. But it's ultimately because we want you in a

1017
00:56:53,065 --> 00:56:57,768
position of risk in the game. And if we let you do it, you can

1018
00:56:57,808 --> 00:57:00,230
just grind your way through the game and actually not be tense.

1019
00:57:00,290 --> 00:57:05,133
And we'd rather have you have fun and be tense than succeed

1020
00:57:05,973 --> 00:57:07,635
and not be tense. Thank you.

1021
00:57:09,505 --> 00:57:13,526
First of all, thank you very much for the talk. It was really great. I'm not sure for what it's

1022
00:57:13,586 --> 00:57:17,907
worth. I think you made the right call. I think the game that you wanted to make, all your

1023
00:57:17,947 --> 00:57:22,888
decisions to go towards that and the community will probably get used to it eventually. As far

1024
00:57:22,908 --> 00:57:29,109
as the question, you mentioned that when you were in early access, a lot of the stuff that you

1025
00:57:29,129 --> 00:57:33,030
changed obviously was in the corp stuff. What was some other stuff that you changed during

1026
00:57:33,070 --> 00:57:35,630
early access and did any of it surprise you?

1027
00:57:37,915 --> 00:57:42,297
did a lot of hero changes based on feedback. A lot of stuff we

1028
00:57:42,317 --> 00:57:44,117
planned out. We knew we were going to make the new dungeons

1029
00:57:44,157 --> 00:57:46,218
and things like that. I think one thing we changed in the

1030
00:57:46,258 --> 00:57:50,460
sanitarium was we split treatment into diseases and

1031
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:55,141
quirks. We allowed the ability to lock quirks in and also some

1032
00:57:55,181 --> 00:57:58,283
negative quirks could become permanent and those would cost

1033
00:57:58,343 --> 00:58:01,384
more to unlock. So I think that was really necessary to pay off

1034
00:58:01,424 --> 00:58:04,245
that system more. And that wasn't something we knew

1035
00:58:04,325 --> 00:58:05,125
exactly up front.

1036
00:58:06,226 --> 00:58:09,928
trying to think of some other things. You know, more

1037
00:58:09,968 --> 00:58:12,630
mechanics. Every hero we try to put in we try to do a new

1038
00:58:12,670 --> 00:58:15,792
mechanic. The hound master had his pet and the dog treats. The

1039
00:58:15,832 --> 00:58:19,755
man at arms had the riposte. That was really fun. And also

1040
00:58:19,795 --> 00:58:21,857
challenging because every time we added a new mechanic we were

1041
00:58:21,877 --> 00:58:23,898
like, oh, man, I wish we could retrofit this through the whole

1042
00:58:23,918 --> 00:58:26,280
game. And we weren't always able to do that. I think it's one

1043
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:29,002
reason that a lot of people like the co-op monsters the best

1044
00:58:29,082 --> 00:58:31,984
mechanically because they came the latest and we were able to

1045
00:58:32,064 --> 00:58:35,146
make full use of the whole palette at that point.

1046
00:58:37,562 --> 00:58:40,683
So oftentimes in design you run into situations where parts of

1047
00:58:40,703 --> 00:58:43,744
the game feel like they're fighting themselves. Like for

1048
00:58:43,824 --> 00:58:47,424
instance, you talk a lot about creating the human connection

1049
00:58:47,764 --> 00:58:51,625
with the units. But then also like because you get such a

1050
00:58:51,745 --> 00:58:54,806
large supply of them, it's almost better for as a player to

1051
00:58:54,866 --> 00:58:57,166
not connect with them so you don't get all tilted when they

1052
00:58:57,186 --> 00:59:00,467
die. Similarly, you talked a lot about how you put so much effort

1053
00:59:00,507 --> 00:59:03,567
and work into the affliction system where the players spend

1054
00:59:03,607 --> 00:59:05,168
most of their time trying to avoid afflictions.

1055
00:59:05,528 --> 00:59:07,429
they spend a lot of time trying to avoid stress all together.

1056
00:59:07,449 --> 00:59:09,810
So how do you kind of deal with that as a designer,

1057
00:59:09,830 --> 00:59:11,510
figuring out where to kind of draw the line

1058
00:59:12,051 --> 00:59:13,391
of what's helping and what's hurting?

1059
00:59:13,751 --> 00:59:16,393
Some of it we intentionally don't totally draw a line.

1060
00:59:16,473 --> 00:59:17,673
The hero one, for example,

1061
00:59:17,813 --> 00:59:19,174
and Chris talked about this a little bit

1062
00:59:19,194 --> 00:59:19,794
yesterday in his talk,

1063
00:59:19,834 --> 00:59:22,115
but people play the game differently.

1064
00:59:22,215 --> 00:59:23,716
So some people get very, very attached

1065
00:59:23,756 --> 00:59:24,416
to name their heroes.

1066
00:59:24,436 --> 00:59:25,456
We encourage you to name your heroes

1067
00:59:25,516 --> 00:59:26,857
after your friends and loved ones.

1068
00:59:27,717 --> 00:59:31,158
and then when they die, you lose your mind. That's awesome. We

1069
00:59:31,178 --> 00:59:33,798
love that. And then some people become very jaded and they look

1070
00:59:33,818 --> 00:59:36,819
at them as meat bags that are basically means to an end. And

1071
00:59:37,099 --> 00:59:40,200
they don't even name them or they name them like crusader 2,

1072
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:44,060
crusader 3. Or sometimes a little bit like Baldwin 1,

1073
00:59:44,261 --> 00:59:46,401
Baldwin 2. So they had a name originally and then they keep

1074
00:59:46,441 --> 00:59:49,882
his lineage up. But a lot of people post, I love reading

1075
00:59:49,902 --> 00:59:52,442
these posts, they'll say like, this game, I had these heroes,

1076
00:59:52,462 --> 00:59:55,003
they're dead, I hate it, what am I doing wrong, I'm terrible at

1077
00:59:55,043 --> 00:59:55,303
the game.

1078
00:59:56,363 --> 01:00:00,885
people will say you're thinking this all wrong. You need to run

1079
01:00:00,905 --> 01:00:03,365
them to their desks until you get some money. Dismiss them.

1080
01:00:03,666 --> 01:00:06,487
Pick a few select heroes to really invest in. Let the other

1081
01:00:06,547 --> 01:00:09,368
ones just, you know. And I love that interplay. There's no right

1082
01:00:09,408 --> 01:00:11,348
way to do it. So there we let that kind of go.

1083
01:00:12,189 --> 01:00:14,871
take care of itself. As far as the affliction system, that's

1084
01:00:14,911 --> 01:00:18,535
hard. We want you to be afflicted. That's a balance

1085
01:00:18,575 --> 01:00:22,118
issue. If I watch streams or get a lot of feedback that people

1086
01:00:22,138 --> 01:00:24,580
are going through and never get afflicted, I want people to get

1087
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:25,521
afflicted. That's a game balance issue.

1088
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:37,364
Hi. So speaking of naming characters after your family, you mentioned high level characters

1089
01:00:37,384 --> 01:00:42,306
dying and that being a really big turn off. I know the same thing happens in games like

1090
01:00:42,487 --> 01:00:44,448
XCOM. Was that something you...

1091
01:00:45,324 --> 01:00:48,686
didn't think you would be able to fix or was it something that

1092
01:00:49,066 --> 01:00:54,089
reinforced that hopelessness motif? In a perfect world,

1093
01:00:54,169 --> 01:00:58,692
would you add something that would help getting your feet

1094
01:00:58,772 --> 01:01:01,613
back? Yes, so we just did, actually. We just pushed

1095
01:01:01,733 --> 01:01:05,396
something to help get your feet back last week. So now we have

1096
01:01:05,416 --> 01:01:07,657
in the stage coach there's an upgrade tree that allows you to

1097
01:01:07,757 --> 01:01:09,518
unlock the ability to hire higher level heroes.

1098
01:01:10,399 --> 01:01:14,924
and so that's really important. And then we increased the power

1099
01:01:14,964 --> 01:01:16,866
leveling benefit from heroes that have been to the darks

1100
01:01:16,886 --> 01:01:20,830
dungeon come back and have the never again trait. So I would

1101
01:01:20,870 --> 01:01:24,815
say that originally we wanted that sense of loss but one

1102
01:01:24,855 --> 01:01:26,777
minute left. We wanted that sense of loss.

1103
01:01:27,818 --> 01:01:30,840
but really getting wiped on a full level 6, no, that's too

1104
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:33,663
much. It's too much if someone literally walks away and doesn't

1105
01:01:33,683 --> 01:01:36,845
play the game again. We want you to be angry for a night and

1106
01:01:36,865 --> 01:01:40,908
then come back tomorrow and be victorious. And so I think we

1107
01:01:40,948 --> 01:01:45,272
just kind of had to think of how to do that. And we're losing a

1108
01:01:45,312 --> 01:01:47,934
level 2 hero is no big deal. Losing four level 6s is a big

1109
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:50,616
deal. So, yeah, we're actively trying to improve that.

1110
01:01:51,557 --> 01:01:55,969
you. Last question, I think. When should a game go early

1111
01:01:56,069 --> 01:01:57,553
access? When it's ready.

1112
01:02:01,145 --> 01:02:06,548
My advice is wait as long as you can. Because early access, we

1113
01:02:06,588 --> 01:02:10,671
now had a number of successes. There's been lots of good games

1114
01:02:10,711 --> 01:02:14,754
in early access as well. And I think that people will always be

1115
01:02:14,794 --> 01:02:17,936
receptive to more good early access games. But they will

1116
01:02:17,996 --> 01:02:21,418
very quickly jump on games that are not fun, not buggy yet. So

1117
01:02:21,698 --> 01:02:23,420
you really have to make those hard choices of

1118
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:28,703
you know, is this game ready for prime time? I think a game that

1119
01:02:28,783 --> 01:02:31,404
fundamentally has its loop in place and is fun but maybe out

1120
01:02:31,425 --> 01:02:34,987
of balance and missing some content, that's where, like if

1121
01:02:35,027 --> 01:02:37,529
we do our next game, I think we know it's fun, we don't know

1122
01:02:37,569 --> 01:02:40,290
about the balance and it's maybe, you know, 50% content

1123
01:02:40,310 --> 01:02:43,352
complete. That might be a good time to launch. I think if

1124
01:02:43,372 --> 01:02:45,294
you're like, let's throw it out there and see where it lands, I

1125
01:02:45,314 --> 01:02:47,615
would do your own sort of private play testing first.

1126
01:02:47,655 --> 01:02:50,737
Because it's really hard to come back from the perception that

1127
01:02:51,518 --> 01:02:54,220
it's a bad game. All right. We'll sneak the last one.

1128
01:02:54,952 --> 01:02:59,155
Who's on your A team? I don't play this game. It's too

1129
01:02:59,175 --> 01:03:06,559
stressful. Thank you very much. Please fill out your reviews.

1130
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:09,181
You know, when you get the e-mail, it would be great to

1131
01:03:09,221 --> 01:03:12,162
know and maybe they'll invite me back again. After brightest

1132
01:03:12,182 --> 01:03:12,483
kittens.
