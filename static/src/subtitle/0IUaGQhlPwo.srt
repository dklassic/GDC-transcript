1
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:06,984
I'm Tyler Sigmund. I'm the co-founder, co-president, design

2
00:00:07,004 --> 00:00:10,830
director, trash man, I don't know, whatever. It's a small

3
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:14,154
company, so we all do a lot of things. Red Hook Studios.

4
00:00:16,198 --> 00:00:18,119
When I was putting this talk together, so it's a postmortem,

5
00:00:18,139 --> 00:00:19,779
we're going to try to cover things that went well, things

6
00:00:19,799 --> 00:00:22,820
that didn't go so well. But as putting the talk together in

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,062
particular, I think on the what went wrongs, I'm going to focus

8
00:00:26,102 --> 00:00:29,103
a lot on one thing, not because there is difficulty in finding

9
00:00:29,143 --> 00:00:31,784
lots of, there's no hubris of difficulty in finding lots of

10
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:33,825
things that went wrong. But I think there's just a couple of

11
00:00:33,845 --> 00:00:35,745
things that were more interesting. So hopefully you'll

12
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:38,747
forgive it's not an exact standard five and five, like the

13
00:00:38,787 --> 00:00:40,127
old GDMAG format.

14
00:00:42,414 --> 00:00:46,778
So darkest dungeon is a turn based gothic horror light

15
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:50,102
fantasy RPG about the psychological stress of

16
00:00:50,162 --> 00:00:54,406
adventuring. And this is, we throw this screen up the minute

17
00:00:54,426 --> 00:00:56,968
you start up the game to make sure you know what you're

18
00:00:56,988 --> 00:00:58,810
getting into. And of course no one reads it because no one

19
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,352
reads tutorials. But this gives us the ability to come back

20
00:01:01,372 --> 00:01:06,517
later and say we told you it was going to be bad. And this is

21
00:01:06,557 --> 00:01:07,578
what it looks like in practice.

22
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:20,258
Come on, healer!

23
00:01:23,259 --> 00:01:27,781
Baby, you gotta go!

24
00:01:27,801 --> 00:01:30,142
Survival is a tenuous proposition.

25
00:01:30,262 --> 00:01:31,462
That's okay, come on, healer!

26
00:01:31,662 --> 00:01:32,603
Sprawling tomb.

27
00:01:32,623 --> 00:01:35,564
Come on!

28
00:01:50,430 --> 00:02:04,740
Healer! Healer!

29
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:10,024
Come on!

30
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:16,528
Come on! Come on!

31
00:02:16,548 --> 00:02:19,710
That's fine as long as you give me one more fucking hit!

32
00:02:20,611 --> 00:02:21,231
Don't do it!

33
00:02:21,352 --> 00:02:21,612
Fuck!

34
00:02:21,652 --> 00:02:21,972
Fuck!

35
00:02:22,112 --> 00:02:23,653
...that's timeless after all.

36
00:02:24,354 --> 00:02:24,494
Fuck!

37
00:02:51,474 --> 00:02:58,119
So that's Ezekiel 3. He actually still likes us. And did play

38
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:00,380
darkest dungeon after that and has actually played it since.

39
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:05,503
And so, yeah, that's nice. So he has gotten some more enjoyment

40
00:03:05,523 --> 00:03:07,845
out of the game. One of the things we set out to do with

41
00:03:07,865 --> 00:03:10,567
darkest dungeon that made it unique is trying to create

42
00:03:10,587 --> 00:03:14,609
emotional attachment. So I think we succeeded. Sometimes maybe

43
00:03:14,649 --> 00:03:17,671
not exactly in the ways that we planned. I mean, I wouldn't say

44
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:19,353
that was like one of our design goals.

45
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:24,753
But when we were coming up with the game idea, so Chris

46
00:03:24,773 --> 00:03:27,496
Brasso's, originally his idea, Chris and I were friends and we

47
00:03:27,676 --> 00:03:29,618
would get together and talk about working on games together.

48
00:03:29,658 --> 00:03:33,762
We had worked at other studios in the past. And this one kept

49
00:03:34,182 --> 00:03:36,184
just, it had so much weight. Every time we would talk about

50
00:03:36,224 --> 00:03:39,448
it, we'd get excited. And the main thing is we're RPG fans,

51
00:03:39,528 --> 00:03:41,169
and there's so many great RPGs out there.

52
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:44,412
I've been playing them my whole life on and off the computer.

53
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:48,897
And one of the things we were really conscious of is just that we didn't want to just make

54
00:03:48,917 --> 00:03:50,158
an RPG because we love them.

55
00:03:50,578 --> 00:03:54,442
We wanted to make an RPG only if there was something maybe different or new that we could

56
00:03:54,542 --> 00:03:55,863
add that might make it stand out.

57
00:03:58,273 --> 00:04:01,137
The real concept here is the idea that heroes are human. And

58
00:04:01,337 --> 00:04:03,239
Chris likes to say it's about the sword arm, not the sword.

59
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,724
It's not how big your shoulder pads and giant glowing sword

60
00:04:06,804 --> 00:04:11,250
are. It's the human wielding it and how willing they are and

61
00:04:11,431 --> 00:04:12,012
able to fight.

62
00:04:13,372 --> 00:04:16,074
And so along with that becomes the whole range of human

63
00:04:16,114 --> 00:04:20,278
emotion. So moments of despair, these uncomfortable decisions

64
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:23,681
we're putting you in as the player confronting you with loss

65
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:27,285
and permanent consequences. But the real secret is we're not

66
00:04:27,345 --> 00:04:28,105
actually sadists.

67
00:04:28,826 --> 00:04:31,829
The moments of despair are there only in so far as to create

68
00:04:31,849 --> 00:04:35,473
moments of triumph. Because what is an act of true heroism

69
00:04:35,513 --> 00:04:38,696
without the possibility of cowardice? And we felt like a

70
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:40,998
lot of RPGs are all about heroism. You have one hit point

71
00:04:41,018 --> 00:04:43,380
and you're fighting the dragon. Whatever. Hang in there. Oops,

72
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,002
didn't go well. Reload. Try again.

73
00:04:46,896 --> 00:04:49,238
A little bit about my background because it's relevant to what's

74
00:04:49,278 --> 00:04:52,620
next is I designed a bunch of games on and off the computer

75
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,602
and a bunch of different genres. I like to say every time I make

76
00:04:55,622 --> 00:04:57,764
a game I enjoy I have to do pendants and make a racing game,

77
00:04:58,724 --> 00:05:01,166
which I do not enjoy and am not particularly good at.

78
00:05:02,387 --> 00:05:05,628
But I think that diverse range of just non-collectible card

79
00:05:05,648 --> 00:05:11,591
games to weird hybrid action games to turn-based really

80
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:15,233
helped because Darkest Dungeon has a ton of systems in it. It's

81
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,675
a small game made by a small team. When you look at

82
00:05:17,715 --> 00:05:20,276
something like The Witcher 3, it's ridiculous for me to say

83
00:05:20,336 --> 00:05:22,157
there's this big scope to the game. But I think there was

84
00:05:22,217 --> 00:05:23,037
unexpected scope.

85
00:05:24,118 --> 00:05:27,458
The main pillars of the play experience are this town,

86
00:05:27,878 --> 00:05:31,019
exploration, combat and camping. And we talked a lot up front

87
00:05:31,119 --> 00:05:34,660
about how much time should the player spend in each of these

88
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:39,020
phases. Combat by far is I think, well, combat and

89
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,901
exploration together are the lion's share of your time. But

90
00:05:41,921 --> 00:05:44,121
that's not to minimize the importance of the time you spend

91
00:05:44,141 --> 00:05:46,542
in camping. Or some people spend an awful lot of time in town

92
00:05:46,962 --> 00:05:48,882
looking at their things and putting their guys into

93
00:05:48,922 --> 00:05:51,803
treatment. But generally you're walking side to side through a

94
00:05:51,823 --> 00:05:52,723
hallway finding things.

95
00:05:54,780 --> 00:06:00,209
built around those four cores though are a ton of systems. And

96
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:02,432
one of the challenges of the game was that a lot of these

97
00:06:02,473 --> 00:06:03,294
systems are

98
00:06:05,162 --> 00:06:07,885
innovations, I guess, which is not trying to say that always

99
00:06:07,945 --> 00:06:10,988
worked, but the affliction system was the real hook of the

100
00:06:11,028 --> 00:06:13,670
game. That was something, you know, it's like how do we

101
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:17,994
psychologically model these heroes? Meanwhile, the cost of

102
00:06:18,014 --> 00:06:19,996
entry making an RPG, you still have to do all the other things,

103
00:06:20,216 --> 00:06:24,900
combat, leveling, quests, monsters, you know, all these

104
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,182
sorts of things. So when you start layering in affliction

105
00:06:27,222 --> 00:06:30,665
system and torchlight and some innovations, it was a lot at

106
00:06:30,705 --> 00:06:31,166
times. So

107
00:06:32,317 --> 00:06:36,661
I think one thing that went well is that a lot of the systems are

108
00:06:36,701 --> 00:06:39,843
not particularly eloquent. Some of them certainly deserve a

109
00:06:39,903 --> 00:06:43,666
second pass, a third pass that maybe never got it. And some of

110
00:06:43,686 --> 00:06:48,329
them are outright clunky. But together it all worked. And

111
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:50,971
sometimes I guess I say it went well because it's just a great

112
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:56,414
It felt like at times that any one system that didn't do its

113
00:06:56,454 --> 00:06:59,215
job was just going to ruin the whole mix. Like you're

114
00:06:59,255 --> 00:07:03,477
overseasoning the stew and I can't recover it now. I think in

115
00:07:03,497 --> 00:07:07,938
this case one of the things I'm just most proud of in the game

116
00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:11,140
is just that it did all hang together, duct tape and bailing

117
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,801
wire and chewing gum and the whole bit to support the goal of

118
00:07:14,821 --> 00:07:16,742
the game which was the heroes are human.

119
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,040
And part of that too, it's really important what we didn't

120
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:25,422
do. For all those systems that I just showed, there was a lot

121
00:07:25,462 --> 00:07:27,422
that we wanted to put in and these are just a couple of them.

122
00:07:28,783 --> 00:07:32,604
Crafting or the idea of a more meaningful upgrade system, more

123
00:07:32,644 --> 00:07:38,265
meaningful gear, loot system. The characters have this armor

124
00:07:38,285 --> 00:07:40,486
and weapon progression. It's just linear progression. You can

125
00:07:40,506 --> 00:07:43,827
go from level 1 upgrade to level 5 in armor, level 1 to level 5

126
00:07:43,947 --> 00:07:46,788
in weapon. You have two trinket slots and.

127
00:07:47,986 --> 00:07:51,689
Of course we could have done a whole bunch more. We could have done paper doll, etc., etc.

128
00:07:51,749 --> 00:07:57,033
But that would have taken away, especially with our team and with the budget that we had set out to make the game with,

129
00:07:57,874 --> 00:08:00,796
if I was spending time on that, I wouldn't have been spending time on the inflation system.

130
00:08:01,317 --> 00:08:02,237
And that would have been a mistake.

131
00:08:02,638 --> 00:08:06,921
Similarly, and this was led really strongly by Chris, the creative director,

132
00:08:07,582 --> 00:08:09,203
is our focus on emergent narrative.

133
00:08:10,224 --> 00:08:13,486
meant that we weren't doing these other cost of entry RPG

134
00:08:13,506 --> 00:08:16,729
features like extensive dialogue trees, going into the Abbey,

135
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:19,251
talking to the Abbot before you commit treatment, like, hello,

136
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,192
Mr. Abbott, what's new today? What rumors have you heard?

137
00:08:22,153 --> 00:08:25,035
None of that. The quests are not particularly in-depth. They're

138
00:08:25,055 --> 00:08:29,039
kind of the equivalent of go get the 10 wolf belts. And we

139
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:32,381
really avoided heavy lore at every possible opportunity. And

140
00:08:32,401 --> 00:08:36,284
that was a creative choice, but all these also support kind of

141
00:08:36,825 --> 00:08:37,725
what we were trying to do. We

142
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:43,631
You know, your ancestor called you to the estate and you need

143
00:08:43,651 --> 00:08:47,393
to go to the wield and fight things or the ruins. So it's

144
00:08:47,433 --> 00:08:50,914
very archetypal, but in doing so, that means you have to

145
00:08:50,954 --> 00:08:53,214
construct a love story in your head. And ultimately what we

146
00:08:53,234 --> 00:08:56,235
wanted to do, what we were really after is the idea of

147
00:08:56,275 --> 00:08:58,436
kind of like these old roguelikes where you make your

148
00:08:58,456 --> 00:09:00,836
character and you go on these crazy adventures and then you

149
00:09:00,856 --> 00:09:03,637
can stream together this story of like, well, that time with

150
00:09:03,677 --> 00:09:06,638
all the slugs in level 10 was rough. I barely got out of that.

151
00:09:06,698 --> 00:09:09,319
Thank God I drank the random potion and polymorphed and got

152
00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:09,499
away.

153
00:09:10,239 --> 00:09:14,263
We wanted you to do that with the heroes. So the more we force fed down your throat, that

154
00:09:14,283 --> 00:09:20,548
wouldn't have worked. So it was very important for us not to do things. Our design process

155
00:09:20,568 --> 00:09:28,274
also went well. Chris, so, you know, I'm designer on the game, design director, but there's

156
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:34,159
a lot to do with this game and a lot of design and a lot came from Chris and I working together

157
00:09:34,239 --> 00:09:38,583
very early. And this isn't always the role. I filled on every game. It's kind of funny.

158
00:09:39,164 --> 00:09:44,689
In this game it very much became this role of Chris drawing all day long and having time to

159
00:09:44,729 --> 00:09:47,792
think because he can draw and think at the same time. I cannot spreadsheet and think about

160
00:09:47,912 --> 00:09:52,877
anything else at the same time. So we would just be spouting ideas. Well, not always spouting.

161
00:09:52,897 --> 00:09:58,262
He carefully thought of something. I kind of got into this role of batting stuff back over the

162
00:09:58,303 --> 00:09:58,463
net.

163
00:10:00,004 --> 00:10:02,625
And then sometimes he really, really, really wanted to talk

164
00:10:02,645 --> 00:10:06,127
about it again, and I could sit with it and get comfortable

165
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:09,548
where it might have gone. In fairness, also my role in the

166
00:10:09,588 --> 00:10:13,309
game was to wrangle all these things and then do the detail

167
00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:16,291
design. Like, okay, afflictions, how does that work? How are we

168
00:10:16,311 --> 00:10:18,511
doing stress? What triggers an affliction? What kind of things

169
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:22,133
can they do in the affliction? But kind of managing that whole

170
00:10:22,193 --> 00:10:25,714
cloud of red stuff was at times just completely maddening but

171
00:10:25,734 --> 00:10:26,154
also fun.

172
00:10:27,075 --> 00:10:52,745
And the creative direction of the game, having that established really strong up front, was what we needed to be able to resist that design feature creep. I mean, I think, you know, I'm a designer and it's, we all make games and it's really hard sometimes. You wake up and have a shower and you think of this awesome thing you'd like to throw in and maybe it goes into the game and sometimes you've got to resist the temptation. And then also don't want to minimize the rest of the team as coming up with great ideas, being there to like reject something that is really bad that, you know,

173
00:10:53,425 --> 00:10:54,606
It just doesn't fly.

174
00:10:55,226 --> 00:11:00,389
And sometimes it was hard because you can't listen to all ideas from all places, but the

175
00:11:00,429 --> 00:11:02,050
rest of the team was really important.

176
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:04,471
Also with vetting and trying and all sorts of these things.

177
00:11:05,872 --> 00:11:10,477
So the system is the hook of the game. And that's really what we

178
00:11:10,517 --> 00:11:13,380
call the whole system for your heroes being human and sometimes

179
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,184
basically being a bunch of unrelieved toddlers. And that's

180
00:11:17,264 --> 00:11:20,007
built on events and situations. If you think about it, being an

181
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:23,370
adventurer is a really, really terrible job. You might be

182
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:26,394
running out of food. You're in search of this elusive gold. It's

183
00:11:26,414 --> 00:11:27,475
kind of like start-up culture.

184
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:33,386
You're in the dark, running out of light, could die at any

185
00:11:33,406 --> 00:11:36,409
moment. So there's these events and situations that lead to

186
00:11:36,449 --> 00:11:40,632
stress. And everyone loves to make fun of how you can read a

187
00:11:40,672 --> 00:11:42,634
book and it can just blow your mind in our game. But that's

188
00:11:42,654 --> 00:11:46,197
very Lovecraftian, to be fair. So stress builds on the heroes

189
00:11:46,297 --> 00:11:48,959
once it reaches 100. We have what's called a resolve check.

190
00:11:49,579 --> 00:11:53,222
And that's a test of their mettle. And that resolves one of

191
00:11:53,242 --> 00:11:56,885
two ways. If you're lucky, they become virtuous. Excuse me,

192
00:11:58,907 --> 00:12:03,409
But more often than not, they become afflicted. And then this

193
00:12:03,469 --> 00:12:06,251
manifests in their behaviors and their stat and bonuses or

194
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:09,433
penalties and narratively in the things they talk about.

195
00:12:11,775 --> 00:12:14,897
The inspiration for the affliction system was not games

196
00:12:15,217 --> 00:12:19,260
really, although I have to show an image. It was more human

197
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:23,443
experience. That's fictional, dramatizations, movies, TV

198
00:12:23,483 --> 00:12:26,846
shows, et cetera, but also just life. Being a manager, we talk

199
00:12:26,886 --> 00:12:31,809
about a lot. Being in a relationship, all these things,

200
00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:35,192
your human experience, it's pretty easy to mine that for how

201
00:12:35,252 --> 00:12:35,992
we react to stress.

202
00:12:37,053 --> 00:12:39,735
And that's a really important point. Darkest Dungeon is not a

203
00:12:39,755 --> 00:12:42,658
game about mental health or mental illness. Darkest Dungeon

204
00:12:42,698 --> 00:12:44,939
is a game about the human response to stress and those are

205
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,422
very different things. So this is an image, I really like

206
00:12:48,442 --> 00:12:50,424
Band of Brothers Europe, obviously based on real events.

207
00:12:50,924 --> 00:12:53,506
And there's this character, Buck Compton, I think that's his

208
00:12:53,546 --> 00:12:57,950
name, played by this actor, Neil McDonough. He's tall, he's

209
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:01,072
handsome, he's tough. He's been on a bunch of missions. He's

210
00:13:01,112 --> 00:13:03,354
kind of just this gregarious, energetic guy that's holding the

211
00:13:03,634 --> 00:13:04,435
squad together in a way.

212
00:13:05,236 --> 00:13:07,557
And they're in the battle of the Ardennes and getting shelled

213
00:13:07,597 --> 00:13:10,359
through the winter. And he watches a shell land in a fox

214
00:13:10,379 --> 00:13:12,941
hole with a couple of his buddies and they're just gone.

215
00:13:12,981 --> 00:13:15,123
They're there one minute, the shell lands, they're gone. And

216
00:13:15,323 --> 00:13:18,365
there's this great scene where he just comes up and he just has

217
00:13:18,405 --> 00:13:21,127
the thousand-yard stare, shell shock, takes off his helmet, and

218
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:24,950
he's just done. That's it. His war is over. And I think that

219
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,752
was really a moment that in a way we wanted to capture.

220
00:13:29,413 --> 00:13:35,697
Game over, man. Hudson and his, he's the most boisterous. I love

221
00:13:35,737 --> 00:13:38,078
watching, especially extended cut, I think there's even more

222
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:40,680
talking, him at the beginning just being total boisterous

223
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,301
asshole and then of course the minute things go to hell he

224
00:13:44,342 --> 00:13:47,083
can't handle it. And Ripley is the one civilian that shouldn't

225
00:13:47,103 --> 00:13:50,625
be able to handle it and is made of steel. But war games and

226
00:13:50,645 --> 00:13:53,046
things have done morale for a long time. And to some degree

227
00:13:53,086 --> 00:13:56,168
what we were doing is bringing a morale system into an RPG.

228
00:13:58,701 --> 00:14:00,842
And so these aren't necessarily new ideas. It's just kind of

229
00:14:00,862 --> 00:14:03,824
maybe packaging them in a different way. The affliction

230
00:14:03,864 --> 00:14:08,126
system had seven afflictions, four virtues. And one of the

231
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,488
neat things is we have 15 different character classes in

232
00:14:10,508 --> 00:14:13,209
the game and we've got custom strings and multiple variants

233
00:14:13,229 --> 00:14:15,771
for every single class, every single affliction virtue, every

234
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:18,212
single act out they can do. That's one of the things we

235
00:14:18,252 --> 00:14:20,253
really invest a lot in and paying out. I think the game

236
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:23,675
has about 70,000 words of text now. And that's funny for a

237
00:14:23,735 --> 00:14:27,778
lower list game with no dialogue trees. So it snuck up on us.

238
00:14:28,438 --> 00:14:31,739
And if you play the game, they say it might be a little hard to

239
00:14:31,779 --> 00:14:36,041
see here, but here the hellion is being masochistic. He's

240
00:14:36,081 --> 00:14:40,664
like, please cut me. I want this. Here I think the highway

241
00:14:40,684 --> 00:14:42,925
man is being abusive and basically berating his party

242
00:14:42,945 --> 00:14:47,447
members. And this is too hard to see. It's a little small. More

243
00:14:47,707 --> 00:14:50,868
of the same. Someone made some fan art which captures the

244
00:14:50,888 --> 00:14:51,969
feeling you get in the game a lot.

245
00:14:53,443 --> 00:14:55,564
If you can't read it, can you people hold your shit together

246
00:14:55,764 --> 00:14:59,445
and hit something for five minutes, please? That happens a

247
00:14:59,485 --> 00:15:03,026
lot. So the important thing about the inflation system is

248
00:15:03,086 --> 00:15:06,787
it's really the hook of the game. I mean, you know, the

249
00:15:06,807 --> 00:15:09,228
game is universally allotted for a lot of things, but this is

250
00:15:09,248 --> 00:15:12,809
kind of always there. And if it didn't work, the whole game

251
00:15:12,849 --> 00:15:16,750
premise falls down. And it's built up of really pretty simple

252
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,450
subsystems.

253
00:15:18,739 --> 00:15:22,262
And we purposefully obfuscate part of that. When your

254
00:15:22,462 --> 00:15:25,104
character is masochistic, we don't tell you what could

255
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,546
happen. We don't tell you exactly what act outs they might

256
00:15:27,586 --> 00:15:31,369
do or how they might run to the front or reject healings. We

257
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:33,491
want you to discover that through play. We don't want to

258
00:15:33,531 --> 00:15:36,153
have a tool tip or as much as I love tool tips, Chris knows I

259
00:15:36,173 --> 00:15:36,674
love tool tips.

260
00:15:38,295 --> 00:15:42,138
I never met a tool tip I didn't love. But at the same point

261
00:15:42,178 --> 00:15:45,601
here, we don't want to show you everything. We want you to

262
00:15:45,641 --> 00:15:48,563
discover it. But it's really important. Stress we could not.

263
00:15:48,703 --> 00:15:51,345
We thought about it. We toyed around with obfuscating stress.

264
00:15:52,086 --> 00:15:54,188
But then we could have the characters talk as they're

265
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:55,909
getting more stressed. Like, hey, I'm getting stressed. But

266
00:15:55,929 --> 00:15:57,811
then you never really know where the breaking point is. And you

267
00:15:57,831 --> 00:16:01,554
can't make any tactical or strategic decisions of how far

268
00:16:01,574 --> 00:16:03,835
to press or what to do or when to camp.

269
00:16:04,676 --> 00:16:07,939
If you don't know. So it actually worked out really well to just make it like a health meter.

270
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,302
We worried it would be a little boring, a little dry.

271
00:16:10,682 --> 00:16:13,705
But that certainly enhanced the game, certainly enhanced the system.

272
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:14,866
You know they're about to break.

273
00:16:15,827 --> 00:16:16,928
And that was really important.

274
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:20,772
The fliction system also features the loss of agency, which I'll talk about a little more.

275
00:16:22,551 --> 00:16:26,054
Yeah, it worked. And I mean, that's why I say it's something

276
00:16:26,074 --> 00:16:28,556
that went well. And I think one of the biggest reinforcements to

277
00:16:28,596 --> 00:16:31,878
me that it worked was during early access, which we were in

278
00:16:31,938 --> 00:16:36,222
for roughly a year, we made very, very few changes to the

279
00:16:36,242 --> 00:16:39,024
affliction system. I mean, frighteningly few. We thought

280
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:41,446
we would go back and we would add a million more act outs and

281
00:16:41,486 --> 00:16:43,748
we would double back on some things that were really rough.

282
00:16:44,348 --> 00:16:47,131
And other than a little bit of tuning and maybe improving the

283
00:16:47,191 --> 00:16:49,953
flow of a few things, like I think now, like if they balk the

284
00:16:49,973 --> 00:16:51,174
heel, you go to heal them and they balk.

285
00:16:51,814 --> 00:16:55,938
We don't penalize you your turn. They don't get to heal but you can still use that character.

286
00:16:56,659 --> 00:16:59,442
We made a couple changes like that but in general we didn't.

287
00:16:59,742 --> 00:17:05,808
And the reason we didn't is because the community was very clear of many other things that they didn't like.

288
00:17:06,129 --> 00:17:07,510
And I think that's important though.

289
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:10,673
The squeaky wheel gets to grease a little bit because this was working

290
00:17:10,893 --> 00:17:14,617
and I think it realized the potential of what the affliction system was supposed to do.

291
00:17:16,217 --> 00:17:19,319
As you've seen with the ZKL video, we successfully not

292
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,562
only made your heroes afflicted, we made the game

293
00:17:21,602 --> 00:17:24,384
players afflicted. How many of you have rage quit Narcos

294
00:17:24,404 --> 00:17:28,268
Dungeon? I don't know if I should ask this. How many of

295
00:17:28,288 --> 00:17:32,011
you rage quit but came back and played again? Thank God. How

296
00:17:32,031 --> 00:17:34,193
many rage quit and are never going to play it again but still

297
00:17:34,233 --> 00:17:39,178
came to the talk anyway? Thank you for your honesty. That's

298
00:17:39,238 --> 00:17:39,278
it.

299
00:17:40,162 --> 00:17:45,370
Thank you for the honesty. I have met people who are like, I like the game, I can never play it, I will never play it again.

300
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:51,439
But it may help you a little bit in your hearts to know that we also made ourselves afflicted a lot.

301
00:17:53,362 --> 00:17:56,343
Through development we developed a vernacular vocabulary for

302
00:17:56,403 --> 00:17:58,584
understanding how stress was impacting us. And actually you

303
00:17:58,604 --> 00:18:02,265
should try it on your teams. It works quite well. So we would

304
00:18:02,305 --> 00:18:05,827
see that, hey, maybe don't talk to them today. They're really

305
00:18:05,847 --> 00:18:10,028
close to afflicted. Or someone would send a nasty e-mail and

306
00:18:10,108 --> 00:18:10,449
then we'd...

307
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,631
Don't worry, they're just abusive right now. They'll get

308
00:18:14,671 --> 00:18:18,613
over it. And to put myself out there, my affliction is a

309
00:18:18,653 --> 00:18:22,015
rationality. As my stress builds and builds and builds and then I

310
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:26,197
become triggered, then I'll pick some really stupid thing to just

311
00:18:26,437 --> 00:18:30,660
panic about. And maybe, you know, just, yeah, coffee or I

312
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,261
don't know what it is. Or make some small point about the game

313
00:18:33,281 --> 00:18:35,543
that I want to fight tooth and nail about that's completely

314
00:18:35,563 --> 00:18:36,643
meaningless. So that's me.

315
00:18:38,286 --> 00:18:41,367
A little bit about this is just to show like this is what we

316
00:18:41,407 --> 00:18:44,047
call the trait library which is this is how the afflictions are

317
00:18:44,067 --> 00:18:46,988
actually hooked up. This isn't particularly sexy but what you

318
00:18:47,008 --> 00:18:50,269
can see there and these slides will be on the vault later is

319
00:18:50,609 --> 00:18:54,570
like a series of buffs to the stats and then situational act

320
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:58,191
outs is what we call them. Like hey, there's this chance of if

321
00:18:58,331 --> 00:19:00,691
it's your turn in combat and you're abusive you might do

322
00:19:00,731 --> 00:19:03,432
this. Or if it's a reaction act out. If someone tries to heal

323
00:19:03,472 --> 00:19:06,392
you and you're paranoid you may reject it because you think

324
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:07,953
they're trying to kill you. That kind of stuff.

325
00:19:10,514 --> 00:19:13,775
And this brings me to one of my favorite things, the Microsoft

326
00:19:13,795 --> 00:19:19,238
Excel. And I think you were saying Ed Fries said hello. Ed

327
00:19:19,678 --> 00:19:22,439
Fries was head of Microsoft games. I like to think of him

328
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:26,081
because he worked on Excel. That's his best accomplishment.

329
00:19:26,521 --> 00:19:28,722
So anyway, Excel is my favorite thing.

330
00:19:30,427 --> 00:19:33,589
Excel is huge. And not Google sheets, I will add. Google

331
00:19:33,609 --> 00:19:36,051
sheets are like for collaboration. I'll use it. But

332
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:40,074
Excel is the thing. Excel, when you're a small team, you need to

333
00:19:40,094 --> 00:19:43,197
figure out ways to move faster. And one of these sheets is

334
00:19:45,178 --> 00:19:49,300
the monster library. There's 200 monster files or something.

335
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,402
And that was really useful to automate that. And so usually

336
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,463
things made their way from sprite sheet into a JSON or

337
00:19:55,483 --> 00:19:58,664
darkest. So it's not like we had the best pipeline ever. But the

338
00:19:58,704 --> 00:20:01,845
programmers were busy doing important things and making the

339
00:20:01,885 --> 00:20:05,086
game. But we had enough to get through. And so that's where I

340
00:20:05,106 --> 00:20:06,847
think the BBA exporters and things like this.

341
00:20:07,467 --> 00:20:10,889
We're so helpful, especially when you're a small team.

342
00:20:10,929 --> 00:20:16,272
So setting up these parametric equations so that you can decide all monsters in the whole

343
00:20:16,292 --> 00:20:17,993
game need a little more help and you don't have to go through.

344
00:20:18,033 --> 00:20:19,974
I'm a big fan of formulas, obviously.

345
00:20:20,674 --> 00:20:24,917
So a lot of that went well, but there's definitely some gaps where we're missing key exporters

346
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:27,538
that I always thought we'd find time to make and never did.

347
00:20:27,918 --> 00:20:30,240
So it became a little confusing working.

348
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:34,543
We make a change for a new feature. Is this an exported

349
00:20:34,563 --> 00:20:36,665
file or a hand edited file? I don't know. I have to look

350
00:20:36,705 --> 00:20:41,270
through my 27,000 spreadsheets. So that sometimes led to

351
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:41,630
problems.

352
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:48,865
Something that went well is our bad design. So there's a few

353
00:20:48,925 --> 00:20:51,948
areas of bad design that I want to focus on. So loss of agency.

354
00:20:52,648 --> 00:20:55,451
That's one. So in other words, your characters do things that

355
00:20:56,252 --> 00:20:59,074
you don't want them to do. They pass their turns. They reject

356
00:20:59,114 --> 00:21:01,917
healing. They basically just make your life difficult. In

357
00:21:01,937 --> 00:21:04,399
talking to my partner Chris, it does sound like maybe being a

358
00:21:04,439 --> 00:21:04,699
parent.

359
00:21:06,691 --> 00:21:10,652
And, you know, we're owning a pet. And that's kind of what

360
00:21:10,672 --> 00:21:14,233
they are. And generally that's bad design. Because, you know,

361
00:21:14,534 --> 00:21:17,895
you should get positive feedback for the actions you do, et

362
00:21:17,935 --> 00:21:19,875
cetera, et cetera. But it was very, very important for

363
00:21:19,915 --> 00:21:23,536
darkest dungeon that you were not in control. I mean, that's

364
00:21:23,576 --> 00:21:25,717
really just like a founding principle. And so even though

365
00:21:25,737 --> 00:21:27,598
we knew it would frustrate the heck out of you sometimes, like

366
00:21:27,618 --> 00:21:30,779
in the Ezekiel video, you know, it came to one of the characters

367
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,979
turns, I think they passed, and then of course he lost the

368
00:21:33,019 --> 00:21:34,380
whole, he had a party wipe.

369
00:21:36,389 --> 00:21:41,182
But this was necessity from the heroes are human idea.

370
00:21:42,967 --> 00:21:44,609
This made it a little hard sometimes because Darkest

371
00:21:44,629 --> 00:21:46,630
Dungeon has a lot of numbers and a lot of systems and it's

372
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:49,593
kind of a tactics, it's a turn-based combat game. And so

373
00:21:49,693 --> 00:21:51,694
how do you, you know, sometimes you're worried about balance

374
00:21:51,835 --> 00:21:55,998
like, hey, this character has like, DPS is like, you know,

375
00:21:56,038 --> 00:21:58,460
undersized by 5% compared to the other characters. And then you

376
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,062
have this system in the game that basically can just rob you

377
00:22:01,102 --> 00:22:04,245
of a turn entirely. And that was sometimes a hard balance to

378
00:22:04,305 --> 00:22:07,387
tread and to get people to expect. Because I think for some

379
00:22:07,427 --> 00:22:10,050
people they genuinely enjoy Darkest Dungeon as just

380
00:22:11,391 --> 00:22:13,373
It would be really cool if not for this affliction system that

381
00:22:13,393 --> 00:22:16,055
keeps getting in the way. Like it's a neat turn-based combat

382
00:22:16,095 --> 00:22:19,299
cool roguelike whatever. So that was hard sometimes to balance

383
00:22:19,399 --> 00:22:22,962
because ultimately there is all this kind of stuff that's taking

384
00:22:23,002 --> 00:22:23,743
control away from you.

385
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,681
Our save system, so if you're familiar with the game, it

386
00:22:28,741 --> 00:22:31,962
saves all the time. Actions are permanent. There's no saves

387
00:22:32,002 --> 00:22:34,883
coming. You have to go through great lengths to do some saves

388
00:22:34,923 --> 00:22:38,924
coming. And so permanent consequences were what we were

389
00:22:38,984 --> 00:22:42,125
after. We want you at all moments to be like, should I go

390
00:22:42,145 --> 00:22:44,626
a little further, maybe get a little more treasure? Do I think

391
00:22:44,646 --> 00:22:47,266
I can make it to the end of this quest even though these two

392
00:22:47,306 --> 00:22:50,667
characters are afflicted and this one is almost dead? And to

393
00:22:50,707 --> 00:22:55,129
do that, we needed this terrible save system that is just really,

394
00:22:55,149 --> 00:22:55,529
really mean.

395
00:22:57,152 --> 00:23:01,833
And it's exceptionally mean because in Ezekiel's video, he

396
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:04,414
crashed out of the game. I guess he calmed down the next day,

397
00:23:04,454 --> 00:23:08,455
came back to play, booted it up, and it had saved right before

398
00:23:08,515 --> 00:23:11,516
the hit that killed his characters because he crashed

399
00:23:11,596 --> 00:23:15,757
out. But it had already rolled, and the action was fixed. So

400
00:23:15,777 --> 00:23:19,058
he's like, okay, we're going to do this. He had to watch it

401
00:23:19,078 --> 00:23:22,499
happen again. So that wasn't intentional.

402
00:23:23,459 --> 00:23:27,480
We did not make a use case for you crashing your computer and

403
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:33,502
out. 15 unbalanced hero classes. So we chose to do more heroes

404
00:23:33,542 --> 00:23:39,044
rather than less. And sometimes the cost of that was balance and

405
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:42,265
attention to each individual hero. But it was a conscious

406
00:23:42,285 --> 00:23:44,826
choice because every hero you add to the game gives you the

407
00:23:44,846 --> 00:23:46,246
ability for more party formations.

408
00:23:50,247 --> 00:23:54,150
We always thought of heroes as loot. It should be exciting when

409
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:57,093
you're waiting for a crusader and a crusader shows up. When

410
00:23:57,113 --> 00:23:58,854
you're waiting for a grave robber and a grave robber shows

411
00:23:58,934 --> 00:23:58,974
up.

412
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:03,420
And it's funny to watch people tweet about this, because full

413
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,701
disclosure, there's no crazy systems in that we detect what

414
00:24:05,721 --> 00:24:09,342
you want and we don't give it to you or anything like that. But

415
00:24:09,382 --> 00:24:11,763
you know, some people are like, you know, I'm 20 weeks in and I

416
00:24:11,803 --> 00:24:15,945
haven't seen a god damn alien. So, yeah, that's just roll of

417
00:24:15,985 --> 00:24:19,266
the dice. But it should be sort of exciting when you really

418
00:24:19,286 --> 00:24:22,547
desperately need another plague doctor to fit, you know, because

419
00:24:22,587 --> 00:24:25,048
you lost one from your A team and you need to bring one back.

420
00:24:25,968 --> 00:24:26,088
And

421
00:24:27,669 --> 00:24:31,150
We made the conscious choice, though, of not to try to balance them all.

422
00:24:31,771 --> 00:24:36,932
This, to varying degrees of success, but it wasn't just because it would be difficult.

423
00:24:37,053 --> 00:24:38,773
We actually wanted it to feel a little spiky.

424
00:24:39,173 --> 00:24:41,294
You know, like first edition D&D. Like, it's crazy.

425
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:46,056
Monks and, you know, monks and magic users are basically just like babies in radio flyers

426
00:24:46,076 --> 00:24:47,916
that you have to pull around for the first couple levels.

427
00:24:48,677 --> 00:24:51,119
You know, but then by the time they get to level 12 it's crazy.

428
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:54,102
They're wiping out entire armies and that kind of stuff.

429
00:24:54,142 --> 00:24:55,784
And I think that spikiness is really fun.

430
00:24:56,344 --> 00:24:59,668
You know, sometimes there's this like crusade to balance the hell out of your game.

431
00:25:00,028 --> 00:25:01,569
I think it really depends what you're trying to accomplish.

432
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:03,711
If it's a multiplayer, you know, it's Hearthstone, yes.

433
00:25:04,612 --> 00:25:06,534
If it's a single player RPG where, you know,

434
00:25:07,335 --> 00:25:09,618
You don't like aliens or you don't like highwaymen as much.

435
00:25:10,078 --> 00:25:13,582
It's not a critical issue. We even had conflict in the team on

436
00:25:13,622 --> 00:25:15,825
this. There was times that people would kind of bring these

437
00:25:15,865 --> 00:25:17,827
things to me and I'm just like, I'm really not worried about

438
00:25:17,847 --> 00:25:20,130
that problem right now. And I think it was hard for people to

439
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:23,353
understand but it was a conscious choice of I'm worried

440
00:25:23,394 --> 00:25:25,176
about the inflection system right now or I'm worried about

441
00:25:25,216 --> 00:25:26,577
something else, not the highwaymen's DPS.

442
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:30,681
And also I think something that's forgotten is that

443
00:25:30,801 --> 00:25:33,586
characters are the sum of their entire usage throughout the

444
00:25:33,626 --> 00:25:36,992
game. In particular combat and camping. And so a lot of times

445
00:25:37,272 --> 00:25:39,837
again to reference DPS we like this character's DPS is too low.

446
00:25:41,676 --> 00:25:44,017
What about their camping skills? What about their versatility?

447
00:25:44,037 --> 00:25:46,318
What about their range of skills and where they can be positioned

448
00:25:47,718 --> 00:25:50,139
in the party and things like that. And there were plenty of

449
00:25:50,179 --> 00:25:52,660
times where a character was underpowered across the board

450
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:57,141
and not intentionally. And so we did that early access was great

451
00:25:57,161 --> 00:26:00,202
for that. But I think a lot of times people look at the

452
00:26:00,242 --> 00:26:03,844
immediate usage of something and not kind of the entirety.

453
00:26:07,967 --> 00:26:13,051
Another thing that was really bad about what we did, but good, was everybody's favorite

454
00:26:13,131 --> 00:26:22,260
lord and savior, RNGesus. We have a lot of RNGesus in the game. A lot of variants. A

455
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:26,784
lot of variants. Intentionally so, which is not always great.

456
00:26:28,963 --> 00:26:31,244
If you make all the right choices in darkest dungeon, you

457
00:26:31,304 --> 00:26:35,285
plan, you assemble a great team, you are experienced, you pick

458
00:26:35,305 --> 00:26:39,486
the right quest, you et cetera, et cetera. We want you still to

459
00:26:39,506 --> 00:26:42,667
get your ass kicked sometimes basically. Now, I want to be

460
00:26:42,687 --> 00:26:45,388
clear, we don't have an AI director system so similar to us

461
00:26:45,408 --> 00:26:47,349
talking about the stage coach. We don't have something that

462
00:26:47,389 --> 00:26:49,369
detects you're doing well and then we swoop in and make it

463
00:26:49,389 --> 00:26:52,650
harder for you. We just rely on the beauty of RNGs and

464
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:55,031
variance. The darkest dungeon is poker.

465
00:26:55,591 --> 00:26:59,013
Poker, everyone has bad beats in poker if you play poker.

466
00:26:59,213 --> 00:27:02,174
And oddly enough, everyone's bad beat story is exactly the same.

467
00:27:02,234 --> 00:27:03,075
It's just told differently.

468
00:27:03,095 --> 00:27:04,075
I was winning.

469
00:27:04,175 --> 00:27:04,775
I should have won.

470
00:27:04,795 --> 00:27:05,276
I didn't.

471
00:27:06,296 --> 00:27:08,617
And we want you to experience those in Darkest Dungeon.

472
00:27:08,957 --> 00:27:11,739
We don't want to, like the tuning part, the craftsmanship,

473
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:13,880
the design, is how often, right?

474
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,461
How often do we want you to experience that 2

475
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:17,141
thirds of the time?

476
00:27:17,181 --> 00:27:19,802
No, if you prepared and planned and took the right party group

477
00:27:19,842 --> 00:27:20,563
into the right dungeon.

478
00:27:21,023 --> 00:27:25,250
And provisioned appropriately and didn't grab every bookcase

479
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:29,277
in Iron Maiden if you didn't have the right stuff for it. You

480
00:27:29,297 --> 00:27:31,260
should do well. But every once in a while.

481
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:35,291
Things go badly. And we want to put you in that uncomfortable

482
00:27:35,331 --> 00:27:38,932
space of I should be winning right now. This is getting away

483
00:27:38,992 --> 00:27:43,534
from me. Do I run? Do I abandon? Do I change my plan? Or do I

484
00:27:43,674 --> 00:27:46,575
hang in here and push through? And there's a couple of you

485
00:27:46,595 --> 00:27:49,196
know, this can go a variety of different ways. Maybe you make

486
00:27:49,236 --> 00:27:51,577
that gut check and you hang in there and you win. And that

487
00:27:51,617 --> 00:27:55,598
should be a moment that you love the game. You should also

488
00:27:55,638 --> 00:27:58,400
applaud yourself for having the self-control to retreat and go

489
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,061
back to town and lick your wounds. And I think that

490
00:28:02,201 --> 00:28:04,142
It's hard to communicate that and that's why we put that

491
00:28:04,222 --> 00:28:06,022
first screen up when I showed you like darkest dungeon is

492
00:28:06,042 --> 00:28:08,783
about making the most of a bad situation. We're conditioned to

493
00:28:08,843 --> 00:28:11,244
play where you expect success, especially in the last few

494
00:28:11,264 --> 00:28:14,205
years with mobile games and things. You expect success. And

495
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:15,905
it's really just a matter of solving the problem to get

496
00:28:15,925 --> 00:28:18,766
there. And if you don't have success, you reload and try and

497
00:28:18,806 --> 00:28:19,806
try again until you get there.

498
00:28:20,567 --> 00:28:22,547
And we fundamentally wanted to change that.

499
00:28:22,607 --> 00:28:25,968
And sometimes I think it's hard to communicate that to players,

500
00:28:26,008 --> 00:28:27,789
that they'll buy the game and then this will happen.

501
00:28:27,829 --> 00:28:29,129
It's just like, what have I gotten into?

502
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:31,710
And the game is not intended for everyone.

503
00:28:32,471 --> 00:28:35,592
And that's something that I think went well,

504
00:28:35,632 --> 00:28:37,752
but it also caused us an amount of grief as well.

505
00:28:39,833 --> 00:28:40,973
Another thing that, you know,

506
00:28:42,195 --> 00:28:45,276
on my role of just doing things that you shouldn't do.

507
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:48,998
We, you know, on our final boss, so I'm going to show a little bit from the final boss,

508
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:52,580
so if you don't want to see it, cover your eyes, if you're still working your way through the game.

509
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,601
And I'm personally not...

510
00:28:55,881 --> 00:28:57,022
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

511
00:28:57,102 --> 00:28:57,542
Explain it.

512
00:28:57,662 --> 00:29:02,745
Father and mother and Alpha and Omega.

513
00:29:02,805 --> 00:29:04,045
Father, mother, Alpha and Omega.

514
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:06,446
Our creator and our destroyer.

515
00:29:06,807 --> 00:29:08,988
You are the heart of the world.

516
00:29:13,208 --> 00:29:16,191
I feel a sense of guilt for being so slow.

517
00:29:16,211 --> 00:29:17,052
Alright, let's begin the game.

518
00:29:17,872 --> 00:29:19,054
Come on to your Mako.

519
00:29:24,198 --> 00:29:24,479
what

520
00:29:34,608 --> 00:29:34,829
what

521
00:29:46,208 --> 00:29:52,959
What do you want me to do?

522
00:29:53,019 --> 00:29:58,487
Do I have to choose one?

523
00:29:58,527 --> 00:29:59,769
Wait, I have to choose one and kill him?

524
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:19,052
So yes, we did just completely kill a character that had

525
00:30:19,112 --> 00:30:22,334
raised to level 6 with no death's door, no nothing. We

526
00:30:22,354 --> 00:30:26,456
just took them away. By that time you probably put, I don't

527
00:30:26,476 --> 00:30:28,377
know, 10 hours in that character, maybe a little more,

528
00:30:28,497 --> 00:30:32,919
who knows. Actually, if it was Raynald or Dismas, that's all

529
00:30:32,939 --> 00:30:35,821
the more meaningful. The tutorial characters, of course.

530
00:30:36,741 --> 00:30:39,883
So yeah, that's a terrible design decision. That's a rage

531
00:30:39,923 --> 00:30:41,243
inducing thing.

532
00:30:43,104 --> 00:30:45,185
But we're so happy we did it. We couldn't be happier actually.

533
00:30:45,465 --> 00:30:50,068
Anyway, there's a whole, I don't know if you got a chance to see Chris' talk yesterday on the creative direction of the game.

534
00:30:50,108 --> 00:30:53,630
But that was really important in paying off this cosmic horror in the overall narrative.

535
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:56,532
And when that goes up on the vault, I encourage you to check that out.

536
00:30:56,572 --> 00:30:57,812
He'll talk more about that battle.

537
00:30:58,313 --> 00:31:02,055
But we wanted you to experience that final battle in a specific way.

538
00:31:02,475 --> 00:31:04,616
And Darkest Dungeon has been about loss the whole time.

539
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:06,177
And so yeah, we were a little cheap.

540
00:31:06,337 --> 00:31:10,800
And we make you remember that even more during the final battle.

541
00:31:14,148 --> 00:31:16,971
I'm going to get a little faster through some of these so we can go through.

542
00:31:17,011 --> 00:31:20,854
Another thing that was pointed out very often to us about poor design here was healing versus

543
00:31:20,874 --> 00:31:21,215
damage.

544
00:31:21,235 --> 00:31:28,642
The amount of healing, the numerical values do not keep pace with the amount of damage

545
00:31:28,662 --> 00:31:29,062
you receive.

546
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:34,644
That was repeatedly reminded to us. And we were like, awesome,

547
00:31:35,145 --> 00:31:39,371
by design. So the quests are a battle of attrition. The longer

548
00:31:39,411 --> 00:31:41,635
you go, eventually your character should die and become

549
00:31:41,675 --> 00:31:44,158
afflicted and stress out. And the whole game is about

550
00:31:45,233 --> 00:31:47,875
Can you get to the end of the quest before that happens or how

551
00:31:47,915 --> 00:31:50,217
much loss are you willing to stomach. If this is your

552
00:31:50,257 --> 00:31:53,540
favorite character, are you going to gold breaking it or

553
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,523
whatever where people always want their guys fully healed,

554
00:31:56,843 --> 00:31:59,645
don't want to make any risk. So you could get one third in a

555
00:31:59,685 --> 00:32:01,807
dungeon and be like screw this I'm out. Whereas other people

556
00:32:01,827 --> 00:32:03,669
are like I'm willing to lose two heroes to get through this.

557
00:32:03,989 --> 00:32:06,191
Even Ezekiel when he lost that third hero,

558
00:32:06,812 --> 00:32:09,174
He held it together pretty well. He knew he was trying to kill a

559
00:32:09,194 --> 00:32:12,316
necromancer and it was worth sacrificing characters. He only

560
00:32:12,356 --> 00:32:15,059
lost it when double death blowed at the end, which to be fair I

561
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:18,902
think would do it to anybody. So one of the things that worked

562
00:32:18,942 --> 00:32:23,946
really well in the game is just breaking some rules. You know,

563
00:32:23,966 --> 00:32:26,408
the save one is the one I always come back to. The way I love to

564
00:32:26,448 --> 00:32:28,910
play games, I like permissive save systems. Who are you to

565
00:32:28,951 --> 00:32:31,293
tell me how I should and shouldn't save my game?

566
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:36,224
But when we talked about Darkest Dungeon, we realized that would not work. It would rob the

567
00:32:36,264 --> 00:32:40,968
player of the experience that we intend them to have. And that was an interesting thing to be

568
00:32:41,349 --> 00:32:45,452
advocating and fighting for something that you don't even agree with normally. You agree with

569
00:32:45,492 --> 00:32:48,575
it for this game. And I think that's a really important point. You should never lose sight

570
00:32:48,615 --> 00:32:52,919
that you are designing for that game, not all games or rules of thumb or like make sure you

571
00:32:52,959 --> 00:32:55,201
never do this. So break the rules.

572
00:32:58,263 --> 00:33:01,004
I'm going to hustle through this. Combat is interesting. We

573
00:33:01,024 --> 00:33:03,905
didn't end up at this exact orientation initially. We were

574
00:33:03,925 --> 00:33:08,147
going to do an ultimate style top down, maybe 2D. At least

575
00:33:08,167 --> 00:33:10,428
that's what I was really interested in at first. We were

576
00:33:10,468 --> 00:33:13,169
very inspired by this classic age, Bards Tale. I think you can

577
00:33:13,189 --> 00:33:15,289
see the DNA in the old Bards Tale. It would be like the first

578
00:33:15,329 --> 00:33:17,910
four characters can attack in melee. The next characters can

579
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:21,712
attack in range. I think you see that in our system in that the

580
00:33:21,752 --> 00:33:24,213
positional requirements in some classes are definitely more

581
00:33:24,253 --> 00:33:26,293
geared towards melee attacks than others.

582
00:33:27,134 --> 00:33:29,255
This is a little more the art side but the gold box games

583
00:33:29,355 --> 00:33:32,336
pull radiance. I know we talked about how effective it was. They

584
00:33:32,376 --> 00:33:35,537
just had an idle and an attack. They sit there and then they

585
00:33:35,557 --> 00:33:40,439
just go. And not to undersell the amazing freaking art that

586
00:33:40,459 --> 00:33:45,301
these guys did. But we're not a game that's fully animated with

587
00:33:45,361 --> 00:33:49,342
all these crazy key frames. They made the most of kind of a light

588
00:33:49,442 --> 00:33:53,424
amount of assets. A ton of work I will add before they kill me.

589
00:33:55,568 --> 00:33:58,729
They're eyeing me right now. It makes me nervous. We did a lot

590
00:33:58,769 --> 00:34:01,890
of visual prototyping. This is something that worked well

591
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:04,331
working with Chris. This sometimes saved us having to

592
00:34:04,511 --> 00:34:07,512
code things up or make things and try them. He would sketch

593
00:34:07,532 --> 00:34:09,933
stuff out. We would talk about the system, kind of mock up what

594
00:34:09,973 --> 00:34:12,614
it might look like, find the holes in that. And I think that

595
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:15,175
was helpful. Here's an example of realizing, hey, not only

596
00:34:15,195 --> 00:34:17,156
with this new system and the slots, but we can have

597
00:34:17,196 --> 00:34:17,896
characters that are bigger.

598
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:22,742
He was working out what poses might be required, trying to

599
00:34:22,782 --> 00:34:27,127
figure out tool tips, which is I think at one point I was

600
00:34:27,828 --> 00:34:28,869
nicknaming tool tip or something.

601
00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:29,190
I don't know.

602
00:34:30,271 --> 00:34:31,112
It ended up like this.

603
00:34:31,472 --> 00:34:33,895
And I think combat is something that has really

604
00:34:33,935 --> 00:34:34,576
served the game well.

605
00:34:35,542 --> 00:34:37,924
Probably one of the biggest unknowns of combat for me was

606
00:34:39,166 --> 00:34:42,309
will there be enough depth in this 1D system. And it was

607
00:34:42,329 --> 00:34:44,892
still something, honestly, I fought even up through the last

608
00:34:44,952 --> 00:34:47,394
dungeon, the cove. It was starting to get like, okay, how

609
00:34:47,415 --> 00:34:50,478
many more weird moves can I think of or status effects or

610
00:34:50,498 --> 00:34:54,042
ways to pay off this. But it held together and I think there

611
00:34:54,082 --> 00:34:56,544
was definitely enough depth to pay it off. So that was good.

612
00:34:58,427 --> 00:35:00,669
And in particular I think one subsystem of death's door that

613
00:35:00,709 --> 00:35:04,431
was effective was this, or of combat, excuse me, was death's

614
00:35:04,471 --> 00:35:07,893
door. And this didn't start in there. We were playing combat

615
00:35:08,113 --> 00:35:11,015
and as you might imagine without the death's door mechanic, so

616
00:35:11,035 --> 00:35:12,756
the death's door mechanic essentially means you can't be

617
00:35:12,776 --> 00:35:15,077
killed in one blow. So without death's door you might be

618
00:35:15,137 --> 00:35:17,419
sitting at two-thirds health, someone gets a crit, your

619
00:35:17,439 --> 00:35:19,540
character's dead. And with permadeath that's crazy. Like

620
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,482
you can never be safe. Even at full health you can never be

621
00:35:22,542 --> 00:35:25,884
safe. And we didn't want it like that. Because then that robs

622
00:35:25,904 --> 00:35:26,544
you of all the

623
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:29,585
You're either tense all the time or you're never tense

624
00:35:29,605 --> 00:35:31,666
because you're just like we're all already dead so what does it

625
00:35:31,686 --> 00:35:35,206
matter. So in this case, you know, a damaging attack, the

626
00:35:35,227 --> 00:35:38,547
most it can do is reduce you to death's door and then you have

627
00:35:38,667 --> 00:35:43,368
potentially a chance to heal or do something to that character

628
00:35:43,668 --> 00:35:47,069
before they die. Now you can still die, obviously, because

629
00:35:47,109 --> 00:35:50,130
sequences of events, you know, you might not get a turn in

630
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:53,271
between. Your hero may be afflicted. The character you're

631
00:35:53,291 --> 00:35:55,751
trying to heal may be afflicted, et cetera. You may have not

632
00:35:55,791 --> 00:35:56,371
brought healers.

633
00:35:57,772 --> 00:36:00,917
So there's plenty of death. But this door, I think it's like

634
00:36:01,037 --> 00:36:04,422
for such a simple system it's been so effective in raising

635
00:36:04,502 --> 00:36:07,106
attention. I love those moments where your character goes to

636
00:36:07,126 --> 00:36:09,409
death's door and you're nervous and you're confronted with the

637
00:36:09,449 --> 00:36:13,134
law. Should I retreat? Should I try to heal? And that's worked

638
00:36:13,154 --> 00:36:13,595
out really well.

639
00:36:14,986 --> 00:36:20,388
Narration is huge. We brought this narrator in for our

640
00:36:20,408 --> 00:36:22,369
announcement trailer. I don't think at that point we had even

641
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:24,830
thought about using one in the game. But he was so amazing.

642
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:28,212
Chris had found these Lovecraft audio books read by Wayne June.

643
00:36:28,632 --> 00:36:30,993
We contacted Wayne June, got him to read for a trailer. And it

644
00:36:31,033 --> 00:36:33,574
was just like, okay, we have to put him in the game. There's

645
00:36:34,655 --> 00:36:38,936
No way we can't. A little side tidbit is Red Hook is named

646
00:36:39,016 --> 00:36:44,577
after the story. We're not in Brooklyn. I wish I would have

647
00:36:44,597 --> 00:36:47,617
thought of that before. We're right next to each other. We're

648
00:36:47,637 --> 00:36:50,138
in Vancouver. But we just thought Red Hook sounded cool.

649
00:36:50,518 --> 00:36:55,679
It's kind of a classic story of power and corruption. Not maybe

650
00:36:55,719 --> 00:36:58,820
the best in terms of Lovecraft's cultural sensitivities. So in

651
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:01,580
retrospect we feel bad for naming it after that story. But

652
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:02,461
Red Hook sounds cool.

653
00:37:05,249 --> 00:37:08,091
It's really, yeah, just this quote, the narrator has done so

654
00:37:08,132 --> 00:37:12,595
much and by remarkability I mean just virality of the game,

655
00:37:12,635 --> 00:37:15,578
people talking about it and things like that aside from its

656
00:37:15,638 --> 00:37:19,100
quality. And this happens all the time. It's crazy. You post a

657
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:22,103
trailer and it will just be strings of comments of the

658
00:37:22,143 --> 00:37:26,406
narrator lines. Or a Reddit post or Twitch channels. And that's

659
00:37:26,446 --> 00:37:29,249
really fun to see. Even pop in places that aren't darkest

660
00:37:29,269 --> 00:37:30,950
dungeons someone will say one thing and it will just go.

661
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:35,414
And audio as a whole worked really well. This is a design

662
00:37:35,434 --> 00:37:38,177
talk but the reason I want to mention it is it reinforces the

663
00:37:38,197 --> 00:37:41,721
gameplay experience. If any of you do play racing games without

664
00:37:41,741 --> 00:37:45,324
the sound on, I don't understand you because I think they're a

665
00:37:45,364 --> 00:37:48,107
lot more fun with the sound on. And it's not just enhancing

666
00:37:48,227 --> 00:37:52,892
like the experience, it's enhancing the game design, which

667
00:37:53,192 --> 00:37:53,773
I'm grateful for.

668
00:37:55,645 --> 00:37:58,886
Narration here is just where I started to block out where

669
00:37:58,906 --> 00:38:01,127
should he speak, what should he talk about, what kinds of

670
00:38:01,147 --> 00:38:05,288
things should he say. And just wanted to play a couple lines.

671
00:38:05,328 --> 00:38:12,690
The human mind, fragile like a robin's egg. There can be no

672
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:21,992
hope in this hell. No hope at all. Grievous injury, palpable

673
00:38:22,252 --> 00:38:22,572
fear.

674
00:38:25,892 --> 00:38:30,560
More dust. More ashes. More disappointment.

675
00:38:33,501 --> 00:38:37,584
On that note of disappointment, it's a good time to switch into

676
00:38:37,624 --> 00:38:40,286
the other side of the talk. On the narration side, I want to

677
00:38:40,306 --> 00:38:42,568
say Wayne is awesome, power up master the lines and did the

678
00:38:42,628 --> 00:38:45,249
effects. Chris and I did writing. Chris did most of the

679
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:49,913
writing. Some of the lines are just really fun to see. I think

680
00:38:49,973 --> 00:38:51,534
even recently someone is like, where is the trinkets and

681
00:38:51,554 --> 00:38:53,655
bobbles line? I haven't heard that in a while. I don't know.

682
00:38:53,715 --> 00:38:55,777
It's like a bug. But someone remembered the line so well,

683
00:38:55,797 --> 00:38:57,038
they were very upset it wasn't playing.

684
00:38:58,539 --> 00:39:02,162
So I love just listening to it. And I think for a gimme one

685
00:39:02,202 --> 00:39:05,665
time power up had Wayne record some other joke lines for each

686
00:39:05,705 --> 00:39:09,328
of us and it was really fun. So yeah, he's got that voice that

687
00:39:09,348 --> 00:39:12,971
sticks out. But yes, disappointment. So how many of

688
00:39:12,991 --> 00:39:17,054
you are familiar with the corpse, the great corpse event?

689
00:39:17,134 --> 00:39:18,295
Okay. Not that many. Okay.

690
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:23,317
That's good. So we pushed this during early access. We pushed

691
00:39:23,357 --> 00:39:26,459
this amazing patch called the hound and corpse or corpse and

692
00:39:26,499 --> 00:39:30,501
hound. It had all kinds of awesome stuff. The hound master,

693
00:39:30,961 --> 00:39:35,323
sanitary features like new and awful diseases. Steam cloud

694
00:39:35,363 --> 00:39:38,904
save, which is kind of cool. But not as cool as diseases. Corpses

695
00:39:38,944 --> 00:39:41,065
in combat. We were so excited about it. There's even a bullet

696
00:39:41,085 --> 00:39:41,225
point.

697
00:39:43,982 --> 00:39:46,303
This is going to be a little relevant here. But if you

698
00:39:46,323 --> 00:39:49,605
remember the end of the dark night where basically things

699
00:39:49,645 --> 00:39:53,607
start going poorly for Batman. Batman takes a lot of blame for

700
00:39:53,627 --> 00:39:57,449
some things. Leading up to the corpse and hound. So we

701
00:39:57,469 --> 00:40:00,030
launched early access on February 3rd of last year.

702
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:04,051
And it did, I mean there's no two bones about it, it did far

703
00:40:04,091 --> 00:40:07,512
better than we thought it was going to do. We were launching

704
00:40:07,532 --> 00:40:10,733
into a climate of early access really being looked down upon.

705
00:40:11,754 --> 00:40:14,214
There had been some kind of high profile maybe disappointments.

706
00:40:15,115 --> 00:40:18,916
And there was even this whole early access is dead. Everyone

707
00:40:18,936 --> 00:40:22,637
likes to proclaim the death of the next thing. So early access

708
00:40:22,697 --> 00:40:24,997
is dead and we're like, okay, we're about to launch.

709
00:40:29,486 --> 00:40:31,987
And we launched into that environment. We put our best

710
00:40:32,027 --> 00:40:34,448
foot forward. We delayed because in the fall we wanted to launch

711
00:40:34,488 --> 00:40:37,569
early access. It wasn't ready. We delayed. We were running

712
00:40:37,669 --> 00:40:42,691
extremely thin on our personal runways. And we kind of had to

713
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:45,893
launch there. We're like, all right. But we had no idea it was

714
00:40:45,913 --> 00:40:48,834
going to be received so well, to be honest. And I think you

715
00:40:48,854 --> 00:40:51,315
could ask, well, actually, Keir. Keir thought it was going to be

716
00:40:51,335 --> 00:40:56,437
received well. The rest of us were nervous as hell. A month

717
00:40:56,497 --> 00:40:57,238
later, my dad died.

718
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,783
So I went from the highest high of my professional life, no

719
00:41:02,823 --> 00:41:06,326
question, to the lowest low of my personal life. I'm grateful

720
00:41:06,367 --> 00:41:09,329
he got to see the launch. I got to share with him how that was

721
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:13,313
going. But when you're a small team, you know, and

722
00:41:15,238 --> 00:41:18,459
Any one discipline that is taken out of action, your whole team

723
00:41:19,279 --> 00:41:22,960
is derailed. I mean, everybody is not taken out of action, but

724
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,400
how are you going to push a patch that incorporates all

725
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,521
disciplines when one person is out of action. This is my dad

726
00:41:28,541 --> 00:41:34,622
in his natural environment. So we had planned this fiends

727
00:41:34,662 --> 00:41:38,102
infringing patch, which was our first real big non-support

728
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:41,003
update. And originally it was probably going to try to go in

729
00:41:41,183 --> 00:41:43,683
March or April, but that didn't happen. I was kind of out of

730
00:41:43,703 --> 00:41:44,383
commission for a while.

731
00:41:45,607 --> 00:41:49,931
And so we pushed it in May and it was received pretty well, I

732
00:41:49,971 --> 00:41:54,134
think. Yeah. And things have been just rolling, you know. So

733
00:41:54,154 --> 00:41:56,256
the corpse and hound was really our first time. Because the

734
00:41:56,596 --> 00:41:59,819
fiends and frenzy had been preplanned in a way. And aside

735
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:03,983
from some game play tweaks, it was sort of preloaded. And the

736
00:42:04,003 --> 00:42:05,884
corpse and hound was the first chance to really collect

737
00:42:07,893 --> 00:42:10,794
Collect info from the community and step back and go what game

738
00:42:10,834 --> 00:42:13,174
systems are not working, what's not working the way we want,

739
00:42:13,214 --> 00:42:16,615
what can we do? And one of the things, it technically wasn't in

740
00:42:16,635 --> 00:42:19,856
the corpse and hound, it came in fiends and frenzy was around

741
00:42:19,876 --> 00:42:22,657
that time was heart attacks. So what had happened is the players

742
00:42:22,677 --> 00:42:24,418
that were getting good at the game could do these dark runs.

743
00:42:24,718 --> 00:42:27,819
They would basically push their team to full affliction and they

744
00:42:27,859 --> 00:42:31,120
realized that the afflictions were not incapacitating so far

745
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:33,561
that your team couldn't function. And so they just stopped

746
00:42:33,581 --> 00:42:35,501
caring about stress or torchlight or anything and they

747
00:42:35,521 --> 00:42:35,901
would just go.

748
00:42:36,806 --> 00:42:38,307
They would just go run these people through.

749
00:42:38,447 --> 00:42:40,569
And that definitely wasn't the feeling we want in Darkest

750
00:42:40,589 --> 00:42:40,749
Dungeon.

751
00:42:40,769 --> 00:42:43,811
We want you always to feel in a precarious situation.

752
00:42:44,372 --> 00:42:47,354
And so the heart attack system came into play, which basically

753
00:42:47,394 --> 00:42:50,716
was at 100 you have your affliction check and then that

754
00:42:50,756 --> 00:42:51,116
resolves.

755
00:42:51,196 --> 00:42:52,638
But stress continues to build.

756
00:42:52,918 --> 00:42:54,299
You have a little bit of a shock absorber there.

757
00:42:54,359 --> 00:42:57,741
But if you get to 200, and the smiley face, you're dead.

758
00:42:58,422 --> 00:42:58,762
No warning.

759
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:04,002
It filled a very important role in terms of what we were trying

760
00:43:04,022 --> 00:43:06,823
to get you to experience. And at the time, actually, there was a

761
00:43:06,863 --> 00:43:12,086
little bit of, oh, this is a little rough, but not outcry. So

762
00:43:12,106 --> 00:43:13,947
then in the corpse and hound, we did corpses, which was

763
00:43:15,868 --> 00:43:19,769
So what you see here in this screen image is a corpse in the

764
00:43:19,809 --> 00:43:23,271
front there. And so there had been a dominant strategy, the

765
00:43:23,311 --> 00:43:26,792
table saw strategy, which is focus fire everything on the

766
00:43:26,852 --> 00:43:30,833
first enemy, take them out, and then that collapses everybody

767
00:43:30,893 --> 00:43:34,775
forward. And the enemies in back, generally they just like

768
00:43:34,815 --> 00:43:37,296
heroes had skill prerequisites. So if you're an archer in the

769
00:43:37,336 --> 00:43:40,197
back, you get collapsed forward, you can't use your attack. And

770
00:43:44,118 --> 00:43:47,260
It was just too strong to focus fire on the front and it kind of

771
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,462
reduced the rest of our combat system to maybe irrelevance in

772
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:53,565
terms of like positioning, ranged attacks, debuffs, buffs,

773
00:43:53,645 --> 00:43:56,827
et cetera. So the corpse is the way they work. You kill the

774
00:43:56,867 --> 00:43:59,629
enemy. They leave a corpse. It remains there. They hold their

775
00:43:59,669 --> 00:44:02,651
formation. They don't collapse forward. And the corpse will

776
00:44:02,671 --> 00:44:04,953
eventually go away or you can spend some extra actions or

777
00:44:04,993 --> 00:44:08,595
resources to eliminate it. And this enhanced, this did a lot of

778
00:44:08,635 --> 00:44:11,998
things. It fixed the dominant strategy. It enhanced the

779
00:44:12,138 --> 00:44:13,078
systems that we had built.

780
00:44:14,259 --> 00:44:16,581
And we thought it did so thematically. We didn't

781
00:44:16,721 --> 00:44:19,803
implement it up to our usual standard and that's partially

782
00:44:19,903 --> 00:44:23,266
for reasons I'll get to in terms of like usually we try to blow

783
00:44:23,286 --> 00:44:26,588
you away visually and this was no fault of the artist. It was a

784
00:44:26,648 --> 00:44:29,530
game play experiment in a way. So every corpse looked the same.

785
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:31,551
We didn't have custom corpses per enemy and things like that.

786
00:44:32,172 --> 00:44:35,174
And also we had thought of a lot of other ideas, or at least I

787
00:44:35,194 --> 00:44:38,316
had in terms of we could buff up the front rank melee enemies to

788
00:44:38,356 --> 00:44:41,499
generally be a lot tougher, these sorts of things. So it was

789
00:44:41,539 --> 00:44:42,819
better than the other design options.

790
00:44:44,199 --> 00:44:47,622
Oh, yeah. Well, I thought people were going to love it. They lost

791
00:44:47,642 --> 00:44:52,567
their minds. It's really hard to overstate how much they lost

792
00:44:52,587 --> 00:44:55,831
their minds. It's definitely, I mean, at least for me, but I

793
00:44:55,851 --> 00:44:57,633
think Chris would agree it's the hardest thing we've had to deal

794
00:44:57,653 --> 00:45:00,416
with on the game. And we've had a lot of challenges on the game.

795
00:45:00,716 --> 00:45:02,198
And hardest probably just emotionally.

796
00:45:06,089 --> 00:45:08,790
It splintered our community which had been big and growing

797
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:12,373
and excited and generally, really we had had it very, very

798
00:45:12,413 --> 00:45:14,754
good. It was very positive. Everything had been received

799
00:45:14,814 --> 00:45:17,656
well generally and people were kind of patiently waiting for us

800
00:45:17,676 --> 00:45:21,078
to plug some holes in the game. It created this changing wave of

801
00:45:21,098 --> 00:45:24,541
sentiment and it was an easily told story, this promising game

802
00:45:24,601 --> 00:45:30,685
gone bad. That wasn't fun to look at Steam and look at the

803
00:45:30,725 --> 00:45:33,106
helpful reviews and see literally four pages of nothing

804
00:45:33,126 --> 00:45:33,567
but negative.

805
00:45:35,617 --> 00:45:38,418
This is a whole story in itself but this also coincided with

806
00:45:38,818 --> 00:45:41,019
people that were not just unhappy that we had added this

807
00:45:41,059 --> 00:45:44,700
into the game but that decided that we were basically the most

808
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,641
terrible people on the face of the planet and remain to believe

809
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:52,343
that way today. And I think this narrative versus truth was hard

810
00:45:52,363 --> 00:45:55,364
for us because what I mean by that is people who played the

811
00:45:55,384 --> 00:45:59,125
game and said I don't like the courses, we respect that

812
00:45:59,165 --> 00:46:02,146
opinion. People are like, I heard they ruined the game.

813
00:46:03,407 --> 00:46:06,669
It's like, well, where did you hear that from? That was tough

814
00:46:06,729 --> 00:46:10,631
because we were also still continuing to develop the game

815
00:46:10,811 --> 00:46:13,032
and we had been excited by how well the game had been received.

816
00:46:13,872 --> 00:46:18,314
This patch launched in July and I remember thinking, you know,

817
00:46:18,374 --> 00:46:21,335
people are going to grouse a little bit. It's a big change,

818
00:46:21,376 --> 00:46:24,617
but then they'll get used to it. And I was in Colorado, so my

819
00:46:24,677 --> 00:46:26,498
father had been cremated and went back to Colorado where

820
00:46:26,538 --> 00:46:29,919
we're from to intern him and be with family, et cetera.

821
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:34,942
And I remember it was either the night before we were going to

822
00:46:35,102 --> 00:46:37,964
bury him or the night after, Chris calls me up and we're

823
00:46:37,984 --> 00:46:41,006
having this talk and he's like, it's getting really bad. I

824
00:46:41,026 --> 00:46:43,528
don't know what to say. They're not getting used to it. The

825
00:46:43,788 --> 00:46:45,068
community is blowing up. It was a tough time.

826
00:46:51,865 --> 00:46:54,567
And this is one way to illustrate it. In July we were

827
00:46:54,607 --> 00:46:57,129
really lucky to have a very popular website that serves a

828
00:46:57,169 --> 00:46:59,650
lot of gamers that are exactly the sort of gamers that we want

829
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:03,793
to reach. They put us in this top 50 RPGs of all time. These

830
00:47:03,833 --> 00:47:07,415
are games like Ultima are on there. And it was a huge honor.

831
00:47:07,435 --> 00:47:09,456
They're like this is the only early access game that's even on

832
00:47:09,476 --> 00:47:13,419
this list. And this was just like, yeah, it was hard to

833
00:47:13,459 --> 00:47:15,860
overstate our excitement of that. That was July. And we

834
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:19,342
pushed the Corpse and Hound patch. This was August from the

835
00:47:19,382 --> 00:47:20,003
same publication.

836
00:47:23,428 --> 00:47:28,754
So I'm fully afflicted at this point for sure. Just pegged at

837
00:47:28,794 --> 00:47:32,298
like 190 stress and we didn't have our desk door mechanic in

838
00:47:32,318 --> 00:47:36,043
the heart attack thing yet so that was rough. And I kept

839
00:47:36,063 --> 00:47:38,926
hinging on these three words, a sad fate. When I read that,

840
00:47:38,986 --> 00:47:41,129
something just clicked in my head that just...

841
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,682
it was just hard to even comprehend. Because we were

842
00:47:45,702 --> 00:47:48,703
still in early access. And we had been this example of an

843
00:47:48,743 --> 00:47:52,585
early access game done right. And now basically we were being

844
00:47:52,625 --> 00:47:56,267
left for dead on the roadside. They took this great game and

845
00:47:56,287 --> 00:47:57,648
they drove it into a concrete pillar.

846
00:47:59,429 --> 00:48:02,651
And I couldn't get over fate. We're still working on the game

847
00:48:02,691 --> 00:48:05,973
here. And this fundamentally changed my view of early access.

848
00:48:06,173 --> 00:48:08,975
I'm super pro early access for the record. I would happily do

849
00:48:08,995 --> 00:48:14,639
it again. I think we're just, we know more what to expect. But I

850
00:48:14,699 --> 00:48:17,020
thought early access would be a time to experiment with gameplay

851
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:20,903
mechanics. And I don't know that that's really true.

852
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:25,449
Especially if your game is already working. If your game

853
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:28,151
is not working, I think you have the onus, you need to improve

854
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:31,394
it. But massive changes to people that have already bought

855
00:48:31,434 --> 00:48:34,376
your game, it's a thorny problem. It's even ethical.

856
00:48:34,396 --> 00:48:38,139
They paid for the game. Now you're changing it. That's hard.

857
00:48:40,681 --> 00:48:43,943
So Chris and I spent a lot of time talking. A lot of time

858
00:48:43,983 --> 00:48:47,846
talking. A lot of Google Hangouts. Some drinking. Some

859
00:48:47,886 --> 00:48:51,009
pity parties. Some anger. The full range of emotions.

860
00:48:52,988 --> 00:48:55,871
But what it always came down to is did we do the right thing.

861
00:48:55,931 --> 00:48:58,833
And I remember just thinking like, okay, guys just lay it on

862
00:48:58,873 --> 00:49:01,476
me. Just tell me, was this a horrible mistake? Because

863
00:49:01,516 --> 00:49:04,618
corpses were my idea and I had sold it up through the team.

864
00:49:04,658 --> 00:49:07,921
Just tell me. I don't care. I'll eat crow. Whatever it is. I

865
00:49:07,961 --> 00:49:10,283
just want to make the game right. And I was losing my

866
00:49:10,303 --> 00:49:13,186
ability to see objectively. So it was great because Chris and I

867
00:49:13,206 --> 00:49:15,608
spent a lot of time switching positions, devil's advocate, all

868
00:49:15,648 --> 00:49:17,329
these discussions about what to do.

869
00:49:19,005 --> 00:49:20,828
Meanwhile we have this community management crisis. It's

870
00:49:20,869 --> 00:49:23,273
not like we have time to do this calmly, et cetera.

871
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:28,904
And one thing that was also relevant is just the psychology

872
00:49:28,984 --> 00:49:32,745
of change. I mean, in other organizations it's a whole field

873
00:49:32,765 --> 00:49:35,886
of study, change management. Some of you may be familiar.

874
00:49:35,946 --> 00:49:38,447
People don't like change. Who moved my cheese and all that.

875
00:49:39,087 --> 00:49:43,188
And not to throw a team member under the bus, but one thing

876
00:49:43,208 --> 00:49:45,969
that had been in my mind before we did this change is that

877
00:49:46,849 --> 00:49:49,910
combat had been working and Chris and Pierre worked to add

878
00:49:49,950 --> 00:49:52,931
this combat camera which fakes it to look like 3D if you

879
00:49:52,971 --> 00:49:54,931
notice in the game that.

880
00:49:55,773 --> 00:50:00,905
I remember putting in and one of the guys on the team saw it

881
00:50:00,925 --> 00:50:03,751
and said, I think this is verbatim, this is the worst

882
00:50:03,812 --> 00:50:05,195
fucking thing I've seen in my entire life.

883
00:50:06,805 --> 00:50:08,547
A week later, two weeks later, I was like, this is cool.

884
00:50:09,307 --> 00:50:10,928
So I thought that would happen with corpses.

885
00:50:11,349 --> 00:50:14,591
So the long story short, and I got a hustle because I wanted

886
00:50:14,611 --> 00:50:19,415
to leave a little time for Q&A, is that we decided it was right

887
00:50:19,435 --> 00:50:19,835
for the game.

888
00:50:19,995 --> 00:50:21,797
It was the right mechanical decision.

889
00:50:21,877 --> 00:50:23,058
It was the right thematic decision.

890
00:50:23,518 --> 00:50:24,178
We stood by it.

891
00:50:24,819 --> 00:50:27,401
You know, that's, of course, a hard decision to make, and we

892
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:29,783
respect the opinions of people that disagree.

893
00:50:30,163 --> 00:50:32,305
So we're in this weird dilemma of do we remove this and make

894
00:50:32,345 --> 00:50:34,766
what we consider a worse game to make people happy?

895
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:40,294
And this is something that got us through the next six months.

896
00:50:40,314 --> 00:50:42,777
I'm going to hurry through here. But Chris kept bringing up,

897
00:50:42,837 --> 00:50:45,780
things had gone so well for us, to be honest. It's like at some

898
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:48,423
point you're going to make a mistake. You have to fall off

899
00:50:48,443 --> 00:50:49,945
the peg. And I was like, I'm going to make a mistake. It's

900
00:50:52,487 --> 00:50:54,867
This was hard. I say fast forward six months but the last

901
00:50:54,907 --> 00:50:58,268
six months up until launching January was pretty rough. We

902
00:50:58,288 --> 00:51:00,609
were sitting here and going is the final story on darkest

903
00:51:00,629 --> 00:51:03,389
dungeon going to be a promising game that was ruined. And

904
00:51:03,429 --> 00:51:06,170
living with that uncertainty I think is instructive just

905
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:09,271
because you think we would be riding high on early access to

906
00:51:09,291 --> 00:51:11,671
sex. No, we were riding low on what's the legacy of the game

907
00:51:11,732 --> 00:51:14,392
going to be. Fast forward I think an interesting part of

908
00:51:14,412 --> 00:51:16,193
change management is we're not going to be able to do that.

909
00:51:17,173 --> 00:51:19,236
Ultimately the changes were received well. And even people

910
00:51:19,256 --> 00:51:22,080
that had expressed concern in July when they reviewed the

911
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:25,645
game, they're like, I see why they did this. So that was good.

912
00:51:26,773 --> 00:51:29,055
What got us through is just holding to that creative vision

913
00:51:29,675 --> 00:51:31,797
and investing in more community management. I mean, these are

914
00:51:31,817 --> 00:51:33,859
things we did wrong. We didn't invest in community management

915
00:51:33,899 --> 00:51:37,182
up front. We were too precious about how to present the game

916
00:51:37,202 --> 00:51:39,604
to people and force our way of playing it down their throats.

917
00:51:39,684 --> 00:51:42,107
So we added toggle options. And I think that's something that

918
00:51:42,147 --> 00:51:46,350
we needed to do. And we learned from this experience. And it

919
00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:49,914
also reminded us that we had always said D.D. is not a game

920
00:51:49,934 --> 00:51:52,256
for everyone. And this reminded us that that was the case.

921
00:51:53,557 --> 00:51:59,025
So that's the key learning about early access. Content is always good. I think that, you

922
00:51:59,045 --> 00:52:01,889
know, sustainable gameplay changes, you want to have community management in place. You

923
00:52:01,909 --> 00:52:04,893
want to warn them of the changes. We do this better now. Hey, this is coming down the line.

924
00:52:05,274 --> 00:52:08,979
Just be aware of this. What do you think about this? We push it in a beta branch. Let people

925
00:52:09,019 --> 00:52:09,440
try it out.

926
00:52:10,661 --> 00:52:14,463
That was stuff we really learned. A few other things I'm going to skip through and then leave

927
00:52:14,483 --> 00:52:18,405
just a couple minutes for questions. The bold points are what I want to emphasis. Other

928
00:52:18,445 --> 00:52:22,026
things, we have a lot of grind in the game. We didn't even add the end game until full

929
00:52:22,046 --> 00:52:25,408
launch so we didn't get the benefit of tuning that through early access so we're doing that

930
00:52:25,428 --> 00:52:29,910
tuning now. And certainly I think one of the things we've been repeatedly deemed on is

931
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:36,172
this grind. We like a consequence, but losing your full level 6 heroes and having to rebuild,

932
00:52:36,233 --> 00:52:38,053
it just causes some people to just throw the game away.

933
00:52:38,514 --> 00:52:41,355
We don't want that. So we've been doing some things to help

934
00:52:41,375 --> 00:52:45,516
with those. Exploration was a really tough design mechanic. I

935
00:52:45,576 --> 00:52:49,038
still believe we haven't totally paid off the walking and the

936
00:52:49,098 --> 00:52:52,880
quests and the curios. In particular, the game started, it

937
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,481
was this auto walk. They kind of walk down the hall and then

938
00:52:55,541 --> 00:52:58,502
things happen. It was terrible. And we almost were going to

939
00:52:58,522 --> 00:53:01,843
restructure all of exploration. When we made it active, it just

940
00:53:01,883 --> 00:53:04,184
made it so much better. So that was something that we spent a

941
00:53:04,224 --> 00:53:05,705
lot of time spending our wheels on.

942
00:53:07,026 --> 00:53:09,228
Everybody's favorite mechanic hunger. It's not that we can't

943
00:53:09,248 --> 00:53:12,131
improve it, it's just that we're, you know, it did enough

944
00:53:12,171 --> 00:53:14,013
and after the corpse thing, quite frankly, we're like, if we

945
00:53:14,033 --> 00:53:15,614
make a hunger system and it's worse, oh, man.

946
00:53:17,778 --> 00:53:23,321
The jostled free, we had these events where you'd be walking

947
00:53:23,361 --> 00:53:25,762
down and pull an event card and something would happen. One of

948
00:53:25,782 --> 00:53:28,124
them was this jostled free. It's like, hey, you're walking down

949
00:53:28,144 --> 00:53:32,426
the hallway and something falls out of your pack. And it just,

950
00:53:32,887 --> 00:53:36,489
can you imagine the rage? You're nice trinket just took it away

951
00:53:36,549 --> 00:53:41,191
randomly. This was really good because it brought up what we

952
00:53:41,211 --> 00:53:42,292
call the jostled free rule.

953
00:53:43,682 --> 00:53:47,870
is, you know, we do a lot to you, but don't arbitrarily with

954
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:51,257
no, you know, another way of saying it is this.

955
00:53:56,701 --> 00:54:00,922
Yeah, never fully, it's like go get the 20 wolf pelts. There was

956
00:54:00,942 --> 00:54:03,083
a lot of stuff that we could have done. I'm going to skip

957
00:54:03,103 --> 00:54:04,323
right through here because I want to have a couple minutes

958
00:54:04,343 --> 00:54:07,124
for questions. In the end, fortunately the dungeon isn't

959
00:54:07,164 --> 00:54:09,385
too dark. Here's some of the stuff. I want to say about

960
00:54:09,445 --> 00:54:12,246
retention, we didn't design with retention in mind, but the

961
00:54:12,266 --> 00:54:14,626
interesting thing about it is just that it's a sign of do

962
00:54:14,666 --> 00:54:17,687
people come back and play more. And that's important to us. When

963
00:54:17,707 --> 00:54:19,668
you played it and started it, you come back the next day

964
00:54:19,688 --> 00:54:21,709
because you want to play again. And that mobile, you know,

965
00:54:23,129 --> 00:54:27,370
PC, whatever, that's hugely important. More than all those

966
00:54:27,410 --> 00:54:30,111
things is we feel like we made the game we set out to make and

967
00:54:30,151 --> 00:54:34,192
that feels good. We're ready to live or die by that vision and

968
00:54:34,592 --> 00:54:37,052
I'm really, you know, we're incredibly grateful that people

969
00:54:37,072 --> 00:54:39,473
have enjoyed it. A little bit about what's coming. We're not

970
00:54:39,493 --> 00:54:42,013
done. We're still pushing some features. We're coming to other

971
00:54:42,033 --> 00:54:46,875
platforms. We're going to enable modders, stuff like that. And

972
00:54:47,135 --> 00:54:50,595
this is news to even the Red Hook team. Today I'm happy to

973
00:54:50,615 --> 00:54:52,596
announce game number two from Red Hook studios.

974
00:54:54,875 --> 00:55:07,927
Brightest kittens. All right. We've got a couple minutes for

975
00:55:07,947 --> 00:55:11,350
questions and then afterwards we'll move out and we'll probably

976
00:55:11,370 --> 00:55:13,052
get kicked out in a minute. We have five minutes. Okay. Great.

977
00:55:15,033 --> 00:55:16,994
What time period does the game take place in?

978
00:55:18,795 --> 00:55:25,059
We narrowly refined the time period to roughly 500 AD to 1800 AD.

979
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:32,883
You've got the Hellion which is kind of almost a Pictish barbarian on up to the highway men

980
00:55:32,903 --> 00:55:35,244
with his little scarf and pistols.

981
00:55:37,506 --> 00:55:43,498
That's kind of part of our lore. We wanted the crusader and his heavy metal armor all the way up to the musketeer.

982
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:48,709
We purposefully have created this alternate universe that isn't super defined there.

983
00:55:50,443 --> 00:55:55,045
Can you speak to the level clamping that was done where the high level characters are no

984
00:55:55,085 --> 00:55:58,426
longer able to go on the low level journeys and what reinforced that decision?

985
00:55:58,646 --> 00:55:59,166
Yeah, sure.

986
00:55:59,186 --> 00:56:04,368
So what he's talking about is basically as your characters level up we prevent you from

987
00:56:04,408 --> 00:56:07,849
taking them on lower level quests and power leveling your younger heroes.

988
00:56:09,290 --> 00:56:12,634
It's not super popular all the time. But the bottom line is if

989
00:56:12,674 --> 00:56:16,840
you can do that, the game is robbed of its tension. And this

990
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:19,263
is kind of like maybe something that isn't incredibly eloquent

991
00:56:19,283 --> 00:56:21,306
from a design perspective. We're kind of hitting you on the head

992
00:56:21,326 --> 00:56:24,751
with a hammer. But it was absolutely critical to make sure

993
00:56:24,771 --> 00:56:26,573
that we keep you in this risk.

994
00:56:27,694 --> 00:56:31,697
So we loosely justify it and say as they level up they get big

995
00:56:31,737 --> 00:56:33,678
heads and they're like I don't want to waste my time down in

996
00:56:33,698 --> 00:56:37,360
your, you know, you're the FNGs, you guys go on your mission. I'm

997
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,080
sticking with the experienced guys. I think even band of

998
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:43,123
brothers had a cool thing like that where they're like as they

999
00:56:43,163 --> 00:56:45,444
progress they're just like the new recruits are coming, don't

1000
00:56:45,484 --> 00:56:47,085
talk to them, they're new. If they've lived through a couple

1001
00:56:47,105 --> 00:56:49,586
missions then we'll talk to them. But we're not able to

1002
00:56:49,626 --> 00:56:52,688
express that. But it's ultimately because we want you

1003
00:56:52,848 --> 00:56:54,469
in a position of risk in the game.

1004
00:56:56,578 --> 00:56:58,880
If we let you do it, you can just grind your way through the

1005
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:01,863
game and actually not be tense. And we'd rather have you have

1006
00:57:01,923 --> 00:57:07,568
fun and be tense than succeed and not be tense. Thank you.

1007
00:57:08,877 --> 00:57:13,458
Hi. First of all, thank you very much for the talk. It was really great. I'm not sure for what it's

1008
00:57:13,538 --> 00:57:17,859
worth, I think you made the right call. I think the game that you wanted to make, all your

1009
00:57:17,879 --> 00:57:22,820
decisions to go towards that and the community will probably get used to it eventually. As far

1010
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:29,041
as the question, you mentioned that when you were in early access a lot of the stuff that you

1011
00:57:29,081 --> 00:57:32,962
changed obviously was in the corp stuff. What was some other stuff that you changed during

1012
00:57:33,022 --> 00:57:35,563
early access and did any of it surprise you?

1013
00:57:37,201 --> 00:57:41,624
Yeah, we did a lot of hero changes based on feedback. A

1014
00:57:41,664 --> 00:57:43,606
lot of stuff we planned out, we knew we were going to make the

1015
00:57:43,646 --> 00:57:46,067
new dungeons, things like that. I think one thing we changed in

1016
00:57:46,107 --> 00:57:50,410
the sanitarium was we split treatment into diseases and

1017
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:54,833
quirks. We allowed the ability to lock quirks in and also if

1018
00:57:54,953 --> 00:57:57,976
some negative quirks could become permanent and those would

1019
00:57:57,996 --> 00:58:01,158
cost more to unlock. So I think that was really necessary to pay

1020
00:58:01,218 --> 00:58:04,640
off that system more. And that wasn't something we knew exactly

1021
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:05,081
up front.

1022
00:58:05,981 --> 00:58:09,862
I'm trying to think of some other things. You know, more

1023
00:58:09,902 --> 00:58:11,922
mechanics. Every hero that we tried to put in, we tried to

1024
00:58:12,002 --> 00:58:13,842
usually do a new mechanic. I mean, the houndmaster had his

1025
00:58:13,882 --> 00:58:17,763
pet and the dog treats. The man at arms had the riposte. And so

1026
00:58:17,783 --> 00:58:20,663
that was really fun. And also challenging because every time

1027
00:58:20,703 --> 00:58:22,804
we added a new mechanic, we were like, oh, man, I wish we could

1028
00:58:22,844 --> 00:58:25,144
retrofit this through the whole game. And we weren't always able

1029
00:58:25,184 --> 00:58:27,405
to do that. I think it's one reason that a lot of people like

1030
00:58:27,445 --> 00:58:30,585
the code monsters the best mechanically because they came

1031
00:58:30,605 --> 00:58:33,106
the latest and we were able to make full use of the whole

1032
00:58:33,126 --> 00:58:33,606
palette at that point.

1033
00:58:37,512 --> 00:58:41,432
So often times in design you run into situations where parts of the game feel like they're

1034
00:58:41,592 --> 00:58:42,413
fighting themselves.

1035
00:58:43,213 --> 00:58:48,294
Like for instance, you talk a lot about creating the human connection with the units.

1036
00:58:49,554 --> 00:58:54,215
But then also because you get such a large supply of them, it's almost better for as

1037
00:58:54,255 --> 00:58:57,356
a player to not connect with them so you don't get all tilted when they die.

1038
00:58:57,576 --> 00:59:02,037
Similarly, you talked a lot about how you put so much effort and work into the affliction

1039
00:59:02,077 --> 00:59:05,097
system where the players spend most of their time trying to avoid afflictions.

1040
00:59:05,477 --> 00:59:07,398
They spend a lot of the time trying to avoid stress altogether.

1041
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:10,980
So how do you kind of deal with that as a designer, figuring out where to kind of draw

1042
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:13,341
the line of what's helping and what's hurting?

1043
00:59:13,681 --> 00:59:16,342
Some of it we intentionally don't totally draw a line.

1044
00:59:16,422 --> 00:59:19,743
The hero one, for example, and Chris talked about this a little bit yesterday in his talk,

1045
00:59:19,763 --> 00:59:22,064
but people play the game differently.

1046
00:59:22,164 --> 00:59:24,365
So some people get very, very attached to naming their heroes.

1047
00:59:24,385 --> 00:59:26,786
We encourage you to name your heroes after your friends and loved ones.

1048
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:30,008
And then when they die, you lose your mind.

1049
00:59:30,428 --> 00:59:30,988
That's awesome.

1050
00:59:31,008 --> 00:59:31,389
We love that.

1051
00:59:31,789 --> 00:59:33,810
And then some people become very jaded, and they look at

1052
00:59:33,850 --> 00:59:36,111
them as meat bags that are basically means to an end.

1053
00:59:36,611 --> 00:59:39,293
And they don't even name them, or they name them like

1054
00:59:39,453 --> 00:59:40,974
Crusader 2, Crusader 3.

1055
00:59:42,034 --> 00:59:44,516
Or sometimes a little bit like Baldwin 1, Baldwin 2.

1056
00:59:44,756 --> 00:59:46,137
So they had a name originally, and then they

1057
00:59:46,177 --> 00:59:46,977
keep his lineage up.

1058
00:59:48,098 --> 00:59:49,138
But a lot of people post.

1059
00:59:49,478 --> 00:59:50,399
I love reading these posts.

1060
00:59:50,419 --> 00:59:52,380
They'll say, this game, I have these heroes.

1061
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:52,840
They're dead.

1062
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:53,641
I hate it.

1063
00:59:53,681 --> 00:59:54,381
What am I doing wrong?

1064
00:59:54,401 --> 00:59:55,261
I'm terrible at the game.

1065
00:59:56,002 --> 00:59:58,305
And then people will say, okay, you're thinking this all wrong.

1066
00:59:58,325 --> 00:59:58,946
You need to look at these.

1067
00:59:59,207 --> 01:00:00,128
You need to just go in there.

1068
01:00:00,408 --> 01:00:02,611
You need to run them to their desks until you get some money.

1069
01:00:02,691 --> 01:00:03,312
Dismiss them.

1070
01:00:03,613 --> 01:00:05,715
Pick a few select heroes to really invest in.

1071
01:00:05,996 --> 01:00:07,358
Let the other ones just, you know.

1072
01:00:07,738 --> 01:00:08,800
And I love that interplay.

1073
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:09,761
There's no right way to do it.

1074
01:00:10,021 --> 01:00:11,243
So there we let that kind of...

1075
01:00:12,304 --> 01:00:16,287
As far as the affliction system, that's hard. We want you to be

1076
01:00:16,307 --> 01:00:20,810
afflicted. That's a balance issue. If I watch streams or get

1077
01:00:20,830 --> 01:00:23,551
a lot of feedback that people are going through and never get

1078
01:00:23,571 --> 01:00:27,153
afflicted, I'm like, that's a problem. I want people to get

1079
01:00:27,173 --> 01:00:29,895
afflicted. That's a game balance issue.

1080
01:00:32,193 --> 01:00:37,297
Hi, so speaking of naming characters after your family, you mentioned high level characters

1081
01:00:37,337 --> 01:00:39,979
dying and that being a really big turn off.

1082
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:42,901
I know the same thing happens in games like XCOM.

1083
01:00:43,782 --> 01:00:44,423
Was that something you...

1084
01:00:45,262 --> 01:00:48,203
didn't think you would be able to fix or was it something that

1085
01:00:49,003 --> 01:00:54,024
reinforced that hopelessness motif? And in a perfect world,

1086
01:00:54,124 --> 01:00:58,625
would you add something that would help getting your feet

1087
01:00:58,705 --> 01:01:01,546
back? Yes. So we just did, actually. We just pushed

1088
01:01:01,666 --> 01:01:05,327
something to help get your feet back last week. So now we have

1089
01:01:05,347 --> 01:01:07,607
in the stage coach there's an upgrade tree that allows you to

1090
01:01:07,687 --> 01:01:09,448
unlock the ability to hire higher level heroes.

1091
01:01:10,348 --> 01:01:14,132
And so that's really important. And then the, what else, we

1092
01:01:14,172 --> 01:01:16,275
increased the power leveling benefit from heroes that have

1093
01:01:16,295 --> 01:01:18,697
been to the dark's dungeon come back and have the never again

1094
01:01:18,757 --> 01:01:22,582
trait. So I would say that originally we wanted that sense

1095
01:01:22,622 --> 01:01:26,786
of loss, but one minute left. We wanted that sense of loss.

1096
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:30,788
But really getting wiped on a full level 6, no, that's too

1097
01:01:30,828 --> 01:01:33,589
much. It's too much if someone literally walks away and doesn't

1098
01:01:33,629 --> 01:01:36,770
play the game again. We want you to be angry for a night and

1099
01:01:36,790 --> 01:01:40,852
then come back tomorrow and be victorious. And so I think we

1100
01:01:40,872 --> 01:01:45,213
just kind of had to think of how to do that. And we're losing a

1101
01:01:45,253 --> 01:01:47,874
level 2 hero is no big deal. Losing four level 6s is a big

1102
01:01:47,894 --> 01:01:50,575
deal. So, yeah, we're actively trying to improve that.

1103
01:01:51,335 --> 01:01:51,615
Thank you.

1104
01:01:52,495 --> 01:01:53,796
All right. Last question, I think.

1105
01:01:54,396 --> 01:01:56,357
When should a game go early access?

1106
01:01:56,977 --> 01:01:57,518
Ah, when it's ready.

1107
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:03,661
My advice is wait as long as you can.

1108
01:02:04,241 --> 01:02:08,264
Because early access, we've now had a number of successes.

1109
01:02:09,524 --> 01:02:11,666
There's been lots of good games in early access as well.

1110
01:02:12,326 --> 01:02:16,588
And I think that people will always be receptive to more good early access games.

1111
01:02:17,249 --> 01:02:21,071
But they will very quickly jump on games that are not fun, not buggy yet.

1112
01:02:21,171 --> 01:02:23,112
So you really have to make those hard choices.

1113
01:02:25,073 --> 01:02:28,654
you know, is this game ready for prime time? I think a game that

1114
01:02:28,714 --> 01:02:31,336
fundamentally has its loop in place and it's fun but maybe out

1115
01:02:31,356 --> 01:02:34,917
of balance and missing some content, that's where, like if

1116
01:02:34,957 --> 01:02:37,378
we do our next game, I think when we know it's fun, we don't

1117
01:02:37,398 --> 01:02:40,220
know about the balance and it's maybe, you know, 50% content

1118
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:43,281
complete, that might be a good time to launch. I think if

1119
01:02:43,321 --> 01:02:45,222
you're like, let's throw it out there and see where it lands, I

1120
01:02:45,262 --> 01:02:47,543
would do your own sort of private play testing first

1121
01:02:47,583 --> 01:02:50,664
because it's really hard to come back from the perception that

1122
01:02:51,465 --> 01:02:54,146
it's a bad game. All right. We'll sneak the last one.

1123
01:02:54,905 --> 01:02:59,087
Who's on your A team? I don't play this game. It's too

1124
01:02:59,107 --> 01:03:06,512
stressful. Thank you very much. Please fill out your reviews.

1125
01:03:07,432 --> 01:03:09,133
You know, when you get the e-mail, it would be great to

1126
01:03:09,153 --> 01:03:12,095
know and maybe they'll invite me back again. After brightest

1127
01:03:12,115 --> 01:03:12,435
kittens.
