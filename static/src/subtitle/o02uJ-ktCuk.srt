1
00:00:04,365 --> 00:00:08,389
Hi everyone, let's get started.

2
00:00:08,389 --> 00:00:10,150
There might be a few more people coming in,

3
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:12,992
but we'll let them feel like they're late

4
00:00:12,992 --> 00:00:14,434
and they're missing out, that's more fun.

5
00:00:14,434 --> 00:00:17,556
Before we get going, can you put your mobile phones

6
00:00:17,556 --> 00:00:20,579
on silent and at the end, can you please remember

7
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:22,220
to fill in your session evaluation form

8
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,342
because it's always nice to hear what people think

9
00:00:24,342 --> 00:00:25,843
and that would make me feel very happy.

10
00:00:25,843 --> 00:00:26,864
So thank you very much for coming.

11
00:00:28,064 --> 00:00:34,656
Right, my name is John Ingold and I'm the narrative director of Inkle. We're a small

12
00:00:34,656 --> 00:00:38,303
independent studio from the UK and we made these things

13
00:00:39,007 --> 00:00:44,468
So we made 80 Days and Sorcery, which are games, and we also made Ink, which is not a game.

14
00:00:44,468 --> 00:00:47,749
It's a scripting language for interactive fiction.

15
00:00:47,749 --> 00:00:52,790
But it kind of demonstrates our philosophy in the way that it's built and the way that it's designed.

16
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:56,872
It's sort of human-focused, it's quite wibbly-wobbly, it likes to branch a lot,

17
00:00:56,872 --> 00:00:59,292
it doesn't have an intrinsic structure, it's much more ad hoc.

18
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:00,933
And those are all things that we like to do.

19
00:01:01,972 --> 00:01:05,862
They're all quite strange things to want to do within a programming context,

20
00:01:05,862 --> 00:01:08,529
and they come from the same root philosophy.

21
00:01:08,529 --> 00:01:10,334
All of these things have the same root philosophy.

22
00:01:11,005 --> 00:01:13,086
Today, I'm going to talk about our new title.

23
00:01:13,086 --> 00:01:15,848
I'm going to talk about our new system that we've been doing.

24
00:01:15,848 --> 00:01:18,550
We've overhauled things quite a lot to produce some, I think,

25
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,651
really quite extraordinary results.

26
00:01:20,651 --> 00:01:23,613
And I hope that I will convince you of that.

27
00:01:23,613 --> 00:01:25,094
But it's a good idea to just back up a bit

28
00:01:25,094 --> 00:01:28,616
and see how we get there, so you can see the process that we've

29
00:01:28,616 --> 00:01:29,557
been through.

30
00:01:29,557 --> 00:01:32,239
Apologies to anyone who's come to any of my previous GDC talks,

31
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:34,400
because a little bit of this will be recapped,

32
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,081
but I'll try to get through it smoothly.

33
00:01:37,224 --> 00:01:44,267
I said who we are and I said who I am, but I want to say what we do in a philosophical sentence.

34
00:01:44,267 --> 00:01:47,108
So the best I could come up with was this.

35
00:01:47,108 --> 00:01:50,669
We make playable stories with high player freedom.

36
00:01:50,669 --> 00:01:52,770
This is a really carefully chosen rubric.

37
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,091
I worried about this a lot.

38
00:01:54,091 --> 00:01:56,632
I didn't ask anyone else on my team if they thought it was appropriate

39
00:01:56,632 --> 00:01:58,212
because I didn't want them to tell me that it wasn't.

40
00:02:00,073 --> 00:02:02,475
and it's obviously composed of two main bits.

41
00:02:02,475 --> 00:02:05,217
You'll notice first up that it doesn't have the word game

42
00:02:05,217 --> 00:02:07,579
in it anywhere, because game's a useless word that

43
00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:09,400
doesn't mean anything.

44
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,002
And it does say playable stories,

45
00:02:12,002 --> 00:02:14,044
and I feel like that's quite honest.

46
00:02:14,044 --> 00:02:16,826
When we design one of our games, products,

47
00:02:16,826 --> 00:02:19,028
when we design one of our products,

48
00:02:19,028 --> 00:02:21,169
we start with the story, we start with the character,

49
00:02:21,169 --> 00:02:22,911
what we want the player to do and feel,

50
00:02:22,911 --> 00:02:25,673
and then we try to design the minimum number.

51
00:02:26,273 --> 00:02:29,854
of mechanics possible to generate that sensation.

52
00:02:29,854 --> 00:02:31,834
So, sorcery is a fantasy adventure.

53
00:02:31,834 --> 00:02:33,334
You have a sword, you have a spell book,

54
00:02:33,334 --> 00:02:35,235
you go around clobbering monsters,

55
00:02:35,235 --> 00:02:35,855
there are some potions.

56
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:38,876
We try to keep it as light touch as possible.

57
00:02:38,876 --> 00:02:41,496
There isn't any crafting because no one actually does that

58
00:02:41,496 --> 00:02:42,637
when they're on a fantasy adventure.

59
00:02:42,637 --> 00:02:45,417
It would be ridiculous until Breath of Wild came along

60
00:02:45,417 --> 00:02:47,578
and did that rather well, actually.

61
00:02:47,578 --> 00:02:49,718
Similarly, In 80 Days is a playable story.

62
00:02:49,718 --> 00:02:50,638
It's about traveling.

63
00:02:50,638 --> 00:02:52,379
So you travel, you pack your suitcases,

64
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:53,859
you talk to people, that's basically it.

65
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:57,892
The second thing is high player freedom.

66
00:02:57,892 --> 00:03:01,974
And again, that's a slightly surprising phrase to use.

67
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:04,495
I haven't said high player agency,

68
00:03:04,495 --> 00:03:05,936
and that's quite deliberate.

69
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:09,718
To me, agency suggests that players can strategize

70
00:03:09,718 --> 00:03:11,639
to achieve a particular outcome.

71
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:13,960
And in our games, that's very rarely true.

72
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,462
We work within highly contextual environments

73
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:18,243
where what happens one moment

74
00:03:18,243 --> 00:03:20,224
might not be available in the next moment.

75
00:03:20,224 --> 00:03:22,005
So strategy can be quite difficult.

76
00:03:22,005 --> 00:03:24,346
What I'm saying is our games are inherently very unfair.

77
00:03:24,706 --> 00:03:25,586
and I'm good with that.

78
00:03:25,586 --> 00:03:29,827
But what we do try to offer is we try to offer a sense of freedom,

79
00:03:29,827 --> 00:03:31,828
that in any given moment in this story,

80
00:03:31,828 --> 00:03:35,149
you can behave in the sort of way you might want to behave,

81
00:03:35,149 --> 00:03:37,809
given the limitations of the interface or whatever.

82
00:03:37,809 --> 00:03:39,710
So you shouldn't feel that you're stuck on a track,

83
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:42,270
you shouldn't feel that you're pressing the only button

84
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,831
that the author gave you to press,

85
00:03:43,831 --> 00:03:46,011
you shouldn't feel that you're just tapping through options.

86
00:03:46,011 --> 00:03:47,892
That's high player freedom,

87
00:03:47,892 --> 00:03:50,012
but I wouldn't go so far as to say that it was agency.

88
00:03:51,235 --> 00:03:58,339
Nonetheless, even though we don't necessarily allow the player to strategize and achieve a particular outcome,

89
00:03:58,339 --> 00:04:03,001
we still have a problem to solve here because we have an oxymoron between those two things.

90
00:04:03,001 --> 00:04:08,024
A story is inherently unfree and freedom is inherently pretty dull for storytelling,

91
00:04:08,024 --> 00:04:11,966
actually. If people can do anything, they tend to just muck about. So how do we deal with that?

92
00:04:11,966 --> 00:04:17,309
Well, okay, we have two simplifications. The first one, we tend to use an episodic structure.

93
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:22,314
So almost all of our games are structured like 1980s Star Trek series is.

94
00:04:22,314 --> 00:04:26,079
You go to somewhere, you do something, any amount of complicated stuff can happen,

95
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:29,643
but by the end of the episode you can be pretty confident that Picard's wife is

96
00:04:29,643 --> 00:04:32,707
going to turn out to be a hologram of a thousand-year-old dead woman,

97
00:04:32,707 --> 00:04:36,651
or an evil robot, or some other kind of mental illness that he's got from a

98
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:37,232
clonk on the head.

99
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:41,013
By the end of the episode, very little is carried into the next episode,

100
00:04:41,013 --> 00:04:43,836
because that's the most convenient way to write it.

101
00:04:43,836 --> 00:04:45,899
And that's what we do in sorcery, and that's what we do in 80 Days.

102
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:48,602
We used to say, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas,

103
00:04:48,602 --> 00:04:51,265
and that's basically true of the construction of 80 Days.

104
00:04:51,912 --> 00:04:53,794
There's nothing wrong with that, that's fine.

105
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:56,257
Assassin's Creed does exactly the same thing.

106
00:04:56,257 --> 00:04:58,999
It will say you can take out this fortress via stealth

107
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:00,881
or via brute force, it's always brute force

108
00:05:00,881 --> 00:05:02,603
because their stealth is so terribly balanced

109
00:05:02,603 --> 00:05:04,024
that it doesn't work at all.

110
00:05:04,024 --> 00:05:05,506
But by the end of that encounter,

111
00:05:05,506 --> 00:05:06,587
when you go to the next one,

112
00:05:06,587 --> 00:05:09,009
it doesn't matter what you did in the last one.

113
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:09,750
Episodic structure.

114
00:05:10,694 --> 00:05:15,376
The other thing that we do is the thing I suppose in a way we're most famous for, perhaps,

115
00:05:15,376 --> 00:05:19,398
is we use a content-heavy approach to branching.

116
00:05:19,398 --> 00:05:20,879
We use a scale-first approach.

117
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:24,721
So when we do branch, because of course we do branch, we do give you some agency and

118
00:05:24,721 --> 00:05:28,783
some influence over the outcome of your adventures, we just write more.

119
00:05:28,783 --> 00:05:29,723
We just make more.

120
00:05:29,723 --> 00:05:33,965
And we can do that because we're delivering everything through text, historically, and

121
00:05:33,965 --> 00:05:37,267
it's very easy, well, it's relatively easy to produce lots of text.

122
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:40,487
So all of that is where we are and what we've done,

123
00:05:40,487 --> 00:05:43,149
which brings me to our next project, our new project,

124
00:05:43,149 --> 00:05:43,950
which is this thing.

125
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,992
It's called Heaven's Vault.

126
00:05:45,992 --> 00:05:48,293
It's a archeological narrative adventure.

127
00:05:48,293 --> 00:05:50,215
You play as this lady, Aliyah al-Azra,

128
00:05:50,215 --> 00:05:51,736
who sails an open-world nebula

129
00:05:51,736 --> 00:05:54,999
and discovers lost ruin sites and ancient inscriptions

130
00:05:54,999 --> 00:05:56,720
in an entire ancient language,

131
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,902
which we've invented for the game,

132
00:05:58,902 --> 00:06:00,803
which is absolutely not what this talk is about.

133
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:04,112
And from a narrative design point of view,

134
00:06:04,112 --> 00:06:08,273
Heaven's Vault had two core elements that we started with.

135
00:06:08,273 --> 00:06:10,614
This isn't even retrofitted, this is actually true.

136
00:06:10,614 --> 00:06:11,554
Joe and I sat down and said,

137
00:06:11,554 --> 00:06:13,534
what do we want to achieve with this project

138
00:06:13,534 --> 00:06:15,875
since we've done what we wanted to achieve

139
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,316
with linear prose fiction?

140
00:06:18,316 --> 00:06:19,916
And the two things were, firstly,

141
00:06:20,697 --> 00:06:24,497
To take the episodic structure and turn it into a single continuous plot.

142
00:06:24,497 --> 00:06:25,598
Fine, okay?

143
00:06:25,598 --> 00:06:29,339
We wanted everything that the player does to further some core narrative.

144
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:31,579
That doesn't mean we're not using episodes.

145
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:34,800
I'll talk about our exact structure later in the talk.

146
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,821
But the idea is instead every episode should further the core narrative of the game

147
00:06:39,821 --> 00:06:41,681
in some meaningful, consistent and solid way.

148
00:06:42,162 --> 00:06:45,363
We're trying to not have too much in the way of standalone encounters,

149
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,924
but rather encounters that make sense within the narrative.

150
00:06:47,924 --> 00:06:51,745
If you like, it's Star Trek Discovery rather than Star Trek The Next Generation,

151
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,486
only without the torture porn Klingon sex.

152
00:06:53,486 --> 00:07:00,769
The second thing that we do is we wanted to move away from purely text-based delivery

153
00:07:00,769 --> 00:07:02,129
to a 3D game world to explore.

154
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:05,351
Quite why we wanted to do that, I look back on and I'm not really sure.

155
00:07:05,351 --> 00:07:07,251
It's a terrible financial decision.

156
00:07:07,251 --> 00:07:07,491
It's been a...

157
00:07:08,655 --> 00:07:10,518
extended the length of the project hugely,

158
00:07:10,518 --> 00:07:12,620
hopefully people will think it is pretty,

159
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,783
which is quite a good reason to do something.

160
00:07:14,783 --> 00:07:17,466
It does mean, though, we have necessarily

161
00:07:17,466 --> 00:07:18,748
a limited number of locations,

162
00:07:18,748 --> 00:07:20,590
we have a limited size of cast,

163
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,893
so we can't use a scale-first approach

164
00:07:22,893 --> 00:07:25,616
to simply make that problem of branching content go away.

165
00:07:25,616 --> 00:07:26,657
We have to reuse stuff,

166
00:07:26,657 --> 00:07:28,339
we have to be a bit different in our redundancy.

167
00:07:29,118 --> 00:07:32,320
So one thing I like about this game is I like the title.

168
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,041
I like the title a lot.

169
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:34,562
It took us a long time to come up with the title.

170
00:07:34,562 --> 00:07:37,083
And one of the reasons I like it is we had our two crutches.

171
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:39,665
We have thrown them both away simultaneously

172
00:07:39,665 --> 00:07:42,907
in a leap of faith, a heaven's vault, if you will,

173
00:07:42,907 --> 00:07:45,508
to create this new game.

174
00:07:45,508 --> 00:07:47,169
And in order to do that, we've had to expand

175
00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:50,471
our sort of core philosophy a little bit as well

176
00:07:50,471 --> 00:07:53,393
to produce what I think is the best description of it

177
00:07:53,393 --> 00:07:55,134
I have so far, which is this.

178
00:07:55,134 --> 00:07:57,215
We are now a company making a narrative adventure

179
00:07:57,215 --> 00:07:57,896
game type thing.

180
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:00,910
with high player freedom.

181
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:01,690
So that's the goal.

182
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,531
That's what I'm attempting to present to you

183
00:08:03,531 --> 00:08:06,391
is our system for producing a narrative adventure game

184
00:08:06,391 --> 00:08:07,852
type thing with high player freedom.

185
00:08:07,852 --> 00:08:10,352
Now, if you were to walk into a design meeting

186
00:08:10,352 --> 00:08:12,193
with that rubric, of course,

187
00:08:12,193 --> 00:08:14,653
everyone would say that I can see an immediate question,

188
00:08:14,653 --> 00:08:16,814
which is you're what?

189
00:08:16,814 --> 00:08:19,394
After all, what is freedom exactly?

190
00:08:19,394 --> 00:08:20,354
What does it mean?

191
00:08:20,354 --> 00:08:22,435
How do we offer it to a player?

192
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:23,735
What are we actually talking about?

193
00:08:24,496 --> 00:08:25,457
This is really interesting.

194
00:08:25,457 --> 00:08:26,738
This is a really interesting question.

195
00:08:26,738 --> 00:08:28,199
What do we mean when we say player freedom?

196
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:31,041
When we say player agency, we're pretty good at

197
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:31,721
analyzing that.

198
00:08:31,721 --> 00:08:34,443
We can say, well, can you formulate a strategy?

199
00:08:34,443 --> 00:08:35,264
Can you execute a plan?

200
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:36,504
Those are the sort of questions.

201
00:08:36,504 --> 00:08:40,067
But what's the right question for this freedom concept that

202
00:08:40,067 --> 00:08:42,729
I'm sort of loosely defining?

203
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:45,531
Well, I think the right question to be asking is

204
00:08:45,531 --> 00:08:45,851
actually.

205
00:08:46,632 --> 00:08:49,455
What question is the player asking themselves?

206
00:08:49,455 --> 00:08:51,557
That's the question we should be asking.

207
00:08:51,557 --> 00:08:53,139
What's the player thinking?

208
00:08:53,139 --> 00:08:54,360
So here is my freedom axis.

209
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,604
There's my beautiful graph of a freedom axis.

210
00:08:57,604 --> 00:08:59,746
And at the very bottom of the freedom axis,

211
00:08:59,746 --> 00:09:02,849
and I want to stress this is not pejorative,

212
00:09:02,849 --> 00:09:05,312
but the least free games, the most tightly linear games,

213
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:07,835
the player is asking, what am I supposed to do now?

214
00:09:08,546 --> 00:09:10,647
What am I meant to do next?

215
00:09:10,647 --> 00:09:12,787
And we've all played games like that.

216
00:09:12,787 --> 00:09:14,048
Monkey Island is like that.

217
00:09:14,048 --> 00:09:15,248
Uncharted is like that.

218
00:09:15,248 --> 00:09:16,509
Shadow of the Colossus is like that.

219
00:09:16,509 --> 00:09:17,249
Here I am in a situation.

220
00:09:17,249 --> 00:09:18,829
What's the thing I'm supposed to do?

221
00:09:18,829 --> 00:09:22,411
What have I not seen yet that I'm supposed to see?

222
00:09:22,411 --> 00:09:25,892
Now, we have to be a bit honest with ourselves here.

223
00:09:25,892 --> 00:09:28,213
I don't think the designers at Naughty Dog

224
00:09:28,213 --> 00:09:30,773
were really hoping that when you play Uncharted,

225
00:09:30,773 --> 00:09:32,394
you're thinking, what am I meant to do now?

226
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,716
I think that's not what they were going for,

227
00:09:35,716 --> 00:09:38,197
but it is definitely true that we are thinking that,

228
00:09:38,197 --> 00:09:40,798
and a lot of the best level design moments

229
00:09:40,798 --> 00:09:43,640
in Uncharted 4 are jokes specifically about the fact

230
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,701
that they know people are thinking like this.

231
00:09:45,701 --> 00:09:47,922
You walk into a room, you can't see any way forward,

232
00:09:47,922 --> 00:09:49,523
you think, what am I supposed to do now?

233
00:09:49,523 --> 00:09:51,363
You turn around and the exit is behind you.

234
00:09:51,363 --> 00:09:53,625
That's a gag set up by a level designer

235
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,686
because they know that you're thinking this question

236
00:09:55,686 --> 00:09:57,186
because it's a tightly linear game.

237
00:09:57,186 --> 00:09:59,407
So if we open it out a little bit more,

238
00:09:59,407 --> 00:10:01,288
the next question is, what can I do?

239
00:10:02,891 --> 00:10:04,613
and obviously there are games that fit that mold.

240
00:10:04,613 --> 00:10:06,534
In Assassin's Creed, I ask myself, what can I do now?

241
00:10:06,534 --> 00:10:07,735
Well, I could go over here,

242
00:10:07,735 --> 00:10:09,677
I could approach this stealthily and get that wrong,

243
00:10:09,677 --> 00:10:11,999
I could attack this guy, whatever.

244
00:10:11,999 --> 00:10:13,360
The Witcher, RPGs in general.

245
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,663
80 Days in Sorcery, of course, sits at the top of this class,

246
00:10:16,663 --> 00:10:19,946
the very paragon of the example of the broader game,

247
00:10:19,946 --> 00:10:21,468
and I'm sure you'll agree, all of that.

248
00:10:21,468 --> 00:10:21,628
But what's...

249
00:10:24,012 --> 00:10:26,893
Above that, what's even freer than the question,

250
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:27,313
what can I do?

251
00:10:27,313 --> 00:10:30,274
Well, the one that we're aiming for, the one that we love,

252
00:10:30,274 --> 00:10:32,234
the one that we should be targeting

253
00:10:32,234 --> 00:10:38,155
if we are narrative designers, is, yikes, what have I done?

254
00:10:38,155 --> 00:10:38,996
That's the perfect state.

255
00:10:38,996 --> 00:10:42,816
That's the sweet spot that we actually want to achieve.

256
00:10:42,816 --> 00:10:45,637
It's very rare for a game to achieve this consistently

257
00:10:45,637 --> 00:10:47,357
the whole way through, and that's OK.

258
00:10:47,357 --> 00:10:48,018
It's a target.

259
00:10:49,736 --> 00:10:51,998
But I felt that quite often playing Horizon Zero Dawn.

260
00:10:51,998 --> 00:10:55,081
I would often go to a dinosaur, lay a complex system of traps,

261
00:10:55,081 --> 00:10:57,903
they would all go hideously wrong, the robots would plow straight through them,

262
00:10:57,903 --> 00:11:01,146
and I'd be attacked by some great big thing I wasn't qualified to deal with,

263
00:11:01,146 --> 00:11:02,427
and I would think, yikes, what have I done?

264
00:11:02,427 --> 00:11:05,730
And that was great. That was a genuine sense that I had freedom,

265
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:07,692
and with freedom comes great, uh...

266
00:11:09,393 --> 00:11:11,794
Responsibility? Great. Ability to mess things up, right?

267
00:11:11,794 --> 00:11:14,095
When we're free to do things, we're free to get stuff wrong.

268
00:11:14,095 --> 00:11:18,156
Obviously, dishonor plays with this, and thief is kind of the ur-example.

269
00:11:18,156 --> 00:11:21,698
A level of thief always starts off with taking one minor decision

270
00:11:21,698 --> 00:11:25,459
that escalates into a farce of hiding guards in cupboards and running away.

271
00:11:25,459 --> 00:11:27,240
It's never been bettered, I think.

272
00:11:28,099 --> 00:11:34,904
A couple of other comments, obviously the ordering of the game in this list could be debated, but why would you bother?

273
00:11:34,904 --> 00:11:38,826
It's not a classification, not all games fit into this in any meaningful way.

274
00:11:38,826 --> 00:11:41,788
If you're playing Minesweeper, you're thinking, why am I playing this?

275
00:11:41,788 --> 00:11:47,632
If you're playing Fortnite, you're thinking, what's going on?

276
00:11:47,632 --> 00:11:51,995
You know, neither of those games are charting here.

277
00:11:53,243 --> 00:11:56,186
But yeah, what I want to think about is,

278
00:11:56,186 --> 00:11:56,787
is yikes, what have I done?

279
00:11:56,787 --> 00:12:01,273
And the examples that I gave were all systemized mechanics.

280
00:12:01,273 --> 00:12:02,695
They were all systems-based games.

281
00:12:02,695 --> 00:12:05,298
But I'm not saying that we need to make a systems-based game.

282
00:12:05,298 --> 00:12:08,562
And I'm not saying that I have any interest in making a systems-based game.

283
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:09,183
I really don't.

284
00:12:09,183 --> 00:12:11,246
They're quite repetitive and boring, actually.

285
00:12:13,016 --> 00:12:18,801
I'm a firm believer, as I hope I've expressed if you've seen any of my previous talks, that

286
00:12:18,801 --> 00:12:23,706
it's fine to change the player's options in a contextual way all the time.

287
00:12:23,706 --> 00:12:28,470
That's not a problem, so long as the options that you provide make sense.

288
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:32,554
The reason systematic games are great is the player has real confidence that they know

289
00:12:32,554 --> 00:12:34,816
what they'll be able to do in five minutes' time.

290
00:12:34,816 --> 00:12:35,597
They can plan.

291
00:12:36,317 --> 00:12:41,479
You can't plan if the choices are being changed up underneath you from turn to turn to turn as they

292
00:12:41,479 --> 00:12:46,561
are in A Choose Your Own Adventure, as they are in 80 Days, but if you trust the author to provide

293
00:12:46,561 --> 00:12:52,943
you with the kind of options that you want then that problem goes away largely actually. So our

294
00:12:52,943 --> 00:12:58,585
goal is to create choices with good affordances that people can just about predict and that appear

295
00:12:58,585 --> 00:13:03,646
to be fair and on the flip side we make sure that our world is utterly unfair and exciting and

296
00:13:03,646 --> 00:13:05,687
interesting to keep you busy and occupied.

297
00:13:06,446 --> 00:13:07,887
So how do we actually go about doing that?

298
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:09,670
What are we aiming to do?

299
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,632
How do we do this, especially in the context

300
00:13:11,632 --> 00:13:14,055
of a narrative adventure game type thingy?

301
00:13:14,055 --> 00:13:17,019
Well, I have three, you know, rule of three.

302
00:13:17,019 --> 00:13:18,541
I have three things, three ideas.

303
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:23,487
Firstly, decisions should always at least appear

304
00:13:23,487 --> 00:13:25,170
to change the game state.

305
00:13:25,917 --> 00:13:29,638
Because if they don't, then the choice you made didn't really happen.

306
00:13:29,638 --> 00:13:31,679
If you want people to be thinking, yikes, what have I done?

307
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:34,580
Then they have to feel like they've done something.

308
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,580
So if they, for example, ask a question of an NPC

309
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:40,482
and then have the option to ask the same question again,

310
00:13:40,482 --> 00:13:43,342
that first asking never really happened.

311
00:13:43,342 --> 00:13:45,103
So people would say, oh, I didn't do that.

312
00:13:45,103 --> 00:13:47,444
That didn't really occur.

313
00:13:47,444 --> 00:13:48,244
So you can't do that.

314
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,985
We have to make sure that if you ask someone something,

315
00:13:50,985 --> 00:13:52,345
then you don't get to ask it again.

316
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:57,524
Similarly, when I ask someone something and I come back to a dialogue hub,

317
00:13:57,524 --> 00:14:01,028
I don't want to see the same two exact questions that I saw a moment ago,

318
00:14:01,028 --> 00:14:03,790
because then it feels like nothing has changed in the game state.

319
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:08,635
Even if you superficially do nothing but change the text of the options a little bit

320
00:14:08,635 --> 00:14:11,097
to reflect the conversation has moved on a touch.

321
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:14,892
That's fine, but I want to feel like time is always moving

322
00:14:14,892 --> 00:14:17,994
because that way I can feel like what I'm doing

323
00:14:17,994 --> 00:14:19,995
may or may not be the thing that caused me

324
00:14:19,995 --> 00:14:21,495
to be in the situation I'm in right now.

325
00:14:21,495 --> 00:14:24,077
I don't want to see the system saying,

326
00:14:24,077 --> 00:14:25,637
your input has been discarded.

327
00:14:25,637 --> 00:14:25,737
Cool.

328
00:14:25,737 --> 00:14:30,380
I like to take that further with our games.

329
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,740
Generally, if you're rude to characters,

330
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,201
they'll get grumpy and they'll eventually wander off.

331
00:14:34,201 --> 00:14:34,942
Things like that.

332
00:14:34,942 --> 00:14:36,662
That sort of stuff is much better.

333
00:14:36,662 --> 00:14:38,623
Arguably, that is a change to the game state,

334
00:14:38,623 --> 00:14:40,084
but it might be quite a subtle one.

335
00:14:40,893 --> 00:14:44,356
Secondly, there should always be a way forward and no getting stuck.

336
00:14:44,356 --> 00:14:49,441
I don't mean that it's ever okay or that anyone thinks it's okay

337
00:14:49,441 --> 00:14:53,005
for a game to let you get to a point where you cannot possibly continue.

338
00:14:53,005 --> 00:14:54,686
I don't mean that kind of stuckness.

339
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:57,529
I mean rather that I don't ever want the player to experience the sensation

340
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:59,431
that they know they're supposed to get through this door,

341
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:00,292
but they don't know how to do it.

342
00:15:01,612 --> 00:15:05,136
Because, obviously, as soon as that happens,

343
00:15:05,136 --> 00:15:06,997
and it happens in adventure games all the time,

344
00:15:06,997 --> 00:15:08,399
they're not thinking, yikes, what have I done?

345
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,041
They're thinking, what am I supposed to do next?

346
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:12,923
And players will drop back to that,

347
00:15:12,923 --> 00:15:15,045
because it's the lowest energy state for them.

348
00:15:15,045 --> 00:15:16,406
If you give them the opportunity to decide

349
00:15:16,406 --> 00:15:18,808
that it's your fault, not their fault,

350
00:15:18,808 --> 00:15:20,170
that they can't get through this door,

351
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,472
then they will take that opportunity very gratefully,

352
00:15:22,472 --> 00:15:24,634
and then they will tell you that your game sucks.

353
00:15:24,634 --> 00:15:25,455
And that is your problem.

354
00:15:25,455 --> 00:15:25,675
Thirdly,

355
00:15:29,105 --> 00:15:31,346
There should be no empty spaces.

356
00:15:31,346 --> 00:15:32,667
There should be no dead air.

357
00:15:32,667 --> 00:15:36,269
I don't think it should be possible to explore an area

358
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,650
in a narrative game with nothing in it that you can do.

359
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:40,651
This happens in adventure games all the time

360
00:15:40,651 --> 00:15:41,472
when you're backtracking

361
00:15:41,472 --> 00:15:42,732
because you're worried that you missed something,

362
00:15:42,732 --> 00:15:44,353
but actually you're going through an environment

363
00:15:44,353 --> 00:15:45,514
which you've completely cased

364
00:15:45,514 --> 00:15:46,355
and there's nothing left in it.

365
00:15:46,898 --> 00:15:49,422
The problem is when I do that, time stops moving.

366
00:15:49,422 --> 00:15:51,705
As a player, I don't think, yikes, what have I done?

367
00:15:51,705 --> 00:15:52,987
Because I haven't done anything.

368
00:15:52,987 --> 00:15:54,770
I just wander around an empty room.

369
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:56,813
That same is true if that empty room has a couple of

370
00:15:56,813 --> 00:15:58,875
characters in it who are sitting there waiting for me

371
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,179
to talk to them, but otherwise doing nothing.

372
00:16:01,179 --> 00:16:01,219
So.

373
00:16:03,611 --> 00:16:05,331
This seems like quite an odd list.

374
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:07,992
This is a curious design shopping list

375
00:16:07,992 --> 00:16:09,332
that doesn't appear to have very much to do

376
00:16:09,332 --> 00:16:11,673
with player freedom, but I argue that these things

377
00:16:11,673 --> 00:16:14,534
are absolutely important to creating this sense

378
00:16:14,534 --> 00:16:17,154
of being in the moment, which is the thing that we want.

379
00:16:17,154 --> 00:16:19,275
And also they are things which pretty much

380
00:16:19,275 --> 00:16:21,915
every single adventure game ever made

381
00:16:21,915 --> 00:16:24,196
has failed all three of them all the time.

382
00:16:24,196 --> 00:16:24,456
Okay, so.

383
00:16:29,835 --> 00:16:31,816
Have any of them done well at all?

384
00:16:31,816 --> 00:16:33,698
Is there anything nice we can say about games

385
00:16:33,698 --> 00:16:34,919
that have existed in the past?

386
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:37,481
Yes, I have a couple of games that I think are brilliant

387
00:16:37,481 --> 00:16:38,622
and will do this really well.

388
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:41,565
Anyone who ever heard me talk about games before ever,

389
00:16:41,565 --> 00:16:43,426
apologies, this is gonna be really the most boring

390
00:16:43,426 --> 00:16:46,469
and predictable two slides you've ever seen.

391
00:16:46,469 --> 00:16:48,510
The first game is The Last Express from 1997.

392
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,551
I think I've put a photo of The Last Express

393
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:51,073
in every talk I've ever done, ever.

394
00:16:51,073 --> 00:16:52,654
It is the greatest game ever made.

395
00:16:52,654 --> 00:16:54,035
If you haven't played it, it's,

396
00:16:54,035 --> 00:16:56,037
well, if you haven't played it, you're a bloody fool.

397
00:16:57,207 --> 00:17:03,089
It's a real-time, always moving forward, train game in which the clock never stops,

398
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:06,750
the characters move around on their own schedules, they ignore you if you don't do anything with

399
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:07,271
them.

400
00:17:07,271 --> 00:17:12,712
It's extremely easy to miss opportunities in it, but it is also extremely good at setting

401
00:17:12,712 --> 00:17:16,293
up opportunities for you to cleverly use that system and find things to do it.

402
00:17:16,293 --> 00:17:17,714
But it's not a systematic game.

403
00:17:18,762 --> 00:17:23,144
Rather, it's a game that offers lots of interesting changes of context throughout its narrative.

404
00:17:23,144 --> 00:17:27,346
It's also the best piece of writing that any video game has ever produced, and it's never

405
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:29,327
been even approached, let alone bettered.

406
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:32,195
But it's far too tight.

407
00:17:32,195 --> 00:17:33,996
It doesn't know how to handle this freedom.

408
00:17:33,996 --> 00:17:36,657
It has lots of fail states where there's nothing you can do

409
00:17:36,657 --> 00:17:38,758
but replay and start the section again.

410
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:41,099
And quite often, the correct way through one

411
00:17:41,099 --> 00:17:43,219
of its fail states is utterly cryptic and hidden.

412
00:17:43,219 --> 00:17:45,740
It doesn't know how to solve that problem.

413
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,421
That's a very hard problem.

414
00:17:47,421 --> 00:17:48,561
But it's a very valid problem.

415
00:17:48,561 --> 00:17:49,402
It's a very good problem.

416
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:50,882
And it is a fantastic piece of work.

417
00:17:50,882 --> 00:17:54,224
The second game that I want to mention

418
00:17:54,224 --> 00:17:55,544
is the Blade Runner adventure game.

419
00:17:58,094 --> 00:18:01,795
which is famous because it randomized who was a replicant

420
00:18:01,795 --> 00:18:03,216
and who wasn't every time you started.

421
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:06,136
But that's really the least interesting thing about it

422
00:18:06,136 --> 00:18:07,337
because you only play it once, right?

423
00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:08,317
So it's an adventure game.

424
00:18:08,317 --> 00:18:09,377
So who cares?

425
00:18:09,377 --> 00:18:11,498
You're never gonna know.

426
00:18:11,498 --> 00:18:12,798
What it actually is though,

427
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:15,319
is a really good example of a detective game.

428
00:18:16,491 --> 00:18:19,394
You go to a location when it is narratively meaningful.

429
00:18:19,394 --> 00:18:21,796
You don't get to go there unless it's narratively meaningful.

430
00:18:21,796 --> 00:18:24,999
Your player always has a good reason to be there.

431
00:18:24,999 --> 00:18:26,160
They case it looking for evidence

432
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,882
or to discover whatever it is they want to find.

433
00:18:27,882 --> 00:18:29,303
When they found everything,

434
00:18:29,303 --> 00:18:31,485
it's clearly telegraphed that maybe now you should go.

435
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,867
And once you go, there's never any reason to go back.

436
00:18:33,867 --> 00:18:36,169
It's very good at removing dead air from the game.

437
00:18:36,169 --> 00:18:39,092
Actually, you can go back, but I have no idea why,

438
00:18:39,092 --> 00:18:40,874
because there's never any reason to do that.

439
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:45,154
Meanwhile, as you find people and suspects,

440
00:18:45,154 --> 00:18:46,875
well, they might be replicants, they might not be,

441
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,295
you might let them go, you might shoot them,

442
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:49,396
you might arrest them,

443
00:18:49,396 --> 00:18:51,256
and it copes with that dynamic story state.

444
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:53,377
It doesn't give you a lot of opportunity

445
00:18:53,377 --> 00:18:55,178
to branch the narrative, but when it does,

446
00:18:55,178 --> 00:18:56,318
it tries to compensate for it

447
00:18:56,318 --> 00:18:58,919
and make sure there's always something for you to do next.

448
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:01,340
It does a really good job of stopping you from getting stuck

449
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,701
by presenting you instead with,

450
00:19:02,701 --> 00:19:04,922
here are some interesting options and we will handle them.

451
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:11,862
But it's far too broad, it's far too ambitious, it randomises bizarre things it doesn't need to,

452
00:19:11,862 --> 00:19:16,664
it produces... it's got the weirdest dialogue system in the entire world in that it has choices

453
00:19:16,664 --> 00:19:20,426
but it chooses the choice for you automatically based on a setting in the menu which says what

454
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:24,368
kind of cop do you want to be. So like, I mean you don't find that setting until you've fiddled

455
00:19:24,368 --> 00:19:27,790
around with it for a while but you can be like the jokey cop or the moody cop or the director's

456
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:30,431
cut cop who says whatever line they thought was best.

457
00:19:32,034 --> 00:19:36,554
it's possible to get stuck because the game chooses the wrong dialogue option for you.

458
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:40,211
which is just, it's bizarre, anyway.

459
00:19:40,211 --> 00:19:42,391
It's far too ambitious, it wasn't properly tested,

460
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:43,532
most playthroughs dry up,

461
00:19:43,532 --> 00:19:45,833
there's just nothing more to do anymore.

462
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:46,773
And those of you who've played it,

463
00:19:46,773 --> 00:19:48,634
which is probably not all that many anymore

464
00:19:48,634 --> 00:19:50,314
because it's quite hard to play now,

465
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,455
the event on the left is the point

466
00:19:52,455 --> 00:19:53,976
at which you can branch the narrative

467
00:19:53,976 --> 00:19:55,756
into being a replicant sympathizer,

468
00:19:55,756 --> 00:19:58,257
which opens up an entire raft of endings,

469
00:19:58,257 --> 00:20:00,858
but only if you perform what can only be described

470
00:20:00,858 --> 00:20:02,659
as an invisible quick time event.

471
00:20:03,219 --> 00:20:06,021
which is one of the worst pieces of design I've ever seen.

472
00:20:06,021 --> 00:20:10,485
But it is a very robust example of how to use your map

473
00:20:10,485 --> 00:20:13,487
as part of your narrative progression.

474
00:20:13,487 --> 00:20:17,470
So, what are we gonna do with all this?

475
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:18,831
How are we gonna go about this?

476
00:20:18,831 --> 00:20:18,951
Well.

477
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:25,204
I'm a great believer in games starting with human beings and starting with tools.

478
00:20:25,204 --> 00:20:30,168
As I said, Ink, our scripting language, is a philosophical statement, and its statement

479
00:20:30,168 --> 00:20:33,551
is that the people writing your game should be able to get on and do that without worrying

480
00:20:33,551 --> 00:20:35,112
about computers too much.

481
00:20:35,112 --> 00:20:40,156
So I want to start our process with working out how we're going to author interactivity

482
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:42,237
in a way that supports freedom.

483
00:20:42,237 --> 00:20:42,278
So.

484
00:20:45,055 --> 00:20:48,838
Our previous games, 80 Days, Sorcery, are basically branching trees.

485
00:20:48,838 --> 00:20:51,159
They're quite complicated, self-referential branching trees.

486
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:54,181
They self-reference each other a lot to make sure that they're dynamic and responsive,

487
00:20:54,181 --> 00:20:58,724
but fundamentally they start here, they wibble around, and they get to an end and they stop.

488
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:00,005
There's only so much you can do with that.

489
00:21:00,507 --> 00:21:02,688
And it's not great when you're arranged in a 3D world,

490
00:21:02,688 --> 00:21:04,269
because you might bounce from prop to prop.

491
00:21:04,269 --> 00:21:05,450
You might want to engage with this,

492
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:06,150
and then engage with that,

493
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,031
and then come back to here,

494
00:21:07,031 --> 00:21:08,031
and then go over there.

495
00:21:08,031 --> 00:21:10,333
That doesn't look or feel like a branching tree

496
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:11,233
in the slightest.

497
00:21:11,233 --> 00:21:12,254
So what do we do instead?

498
00:21:12,254 --> 00:21:15,176
Well, we took an approach that we prototyped a little bit

499
00:21:15,176 --> 00:21:19,018
during the sorcery games of a system

500
00:21:19,018 --> 00:21:22,040
which offers content on the fly if it's appropriate.

501
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:26,223
We've made all of our content atomic,

502
00:21:26,223 --> 00:21:26,903
by which I mean.

503
00:21:27,808 --> 00:21:30,629
Every action, including dialogue, is a little blob of content.

504
00:21:30,629 --> 00:21:32,670
It sits on its own somewhere in the code.

505
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:35,631
Every blob is gated by preconditions.

506
00:21:35,631 --> 00:21:38,572
A precondition is just a piece of logic that says

507
00:21:38,572 --> 00:21:41,894
this is what you need for this bit of content to be appropriate,

508
00:21:41,894 --> 00:21:43,014
to be meaningful right now.

509
00:21:43,014 --> 00:21:46,976
And of course, the preconditions must be satisfied

510
00:21:46,976 --> 00:21:49,397
for the content to be allowed to be surfaced by the game.

511
00:21:50,082 --> 00:21:52,443
This design is drawn from Inform 7.

512
00:21:52,443 --> 00:21:56,264
I think it was the rule-based design used there,

513
00:21:56,264 --> 00:21:57,864
which was the work of Graham Nelson,

514
00:21:57,864 --> 00:21:59,785
Emily Short, Andrew Plotkin, possibly others.

515
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:03,966
But I've never seen it used in an adventure game,

516
00:22:03,966 --> 00:22:05,946
to my knowledge, anyway.

517
00:22:05,946 --> 00:22:07,307
So we do all of this in ink.

518
00:22:07,307 --> 00:22:09,807
Ink looks roughly like this.

519
00:22:09,807 --> 00:22:11,168
This is a shot from our demo,

520
00:22:11,168 --> 00:22:13,348
so there's a couple of options on this shrine thing.

521
00:22:13,348 --> 00:22:15,569
There are three blobs of content

522
00:22:15,569 --> 00:22:17,109
in the content bucket of the game.

523
00:22:17,843 --> 00:22:20,064
Those preconditions are the little things in curly braces.

524
00:22:20,064 --> 00:22:22,926
The top two, all of those preconditions are being satisfied.

525
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:25,987
So those options are surfaced and you can see them attached to the pillar.

526
00:22:25,987 --> 00:22:28,628
The bottom one is not being surfaced.

527
00:22:28,628 --> 00:22:30,769
Something in that must not be true.

528
00:22:30,769 --> 00:22:33,550
In this case, it's I've recently been zapped by this thing.

529
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:36,571
And so the condition not recently zapped by shrine fails.

530
00:22:36,571 --> 00:22:37,972
So it doesn't allow it to surface.

531
00:22:37,972 --> 00:22:39,712
And that's what I mean by atomic content.

532
00:22:39,712 --> 00:22:41,853
This isn't a branching tree.

533
00:22:41,853 --> 00:22:43,294
It's just a set of things that might happen.

534
00:22:43,294 --> 00:22:45,575
These are brilliant.

535
00:22:46,225 --> 00:22:48,086
They're really, really, really powerful,

536
00:22:48,086 --> 00:22:51,409
because you can just keep loading stuff onto them.

537
00:22:51,409 --> 00:22:53,130
So the types of preconditions that we use,

538
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,991
I'll just catalog them very quickly.

539
00:22:54,991 --> 00:22:57,532
The world state, obviously, where are you,

540
00:22:57,532 --> 00:22:59,113
what can you see, what can you touch,

541
00:22:59,113 --> 00:23:00,875
what have you got, what's open, what's closed,

542
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:01,875
all the normal kind of things.

543
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:04,557
So we do some state tracking, we use trigger volumes,

544
00:23:04,557 --> 00:23:05,798
we use raycasts, whatever.

545
00:23:06,543 --> 00:23:12,426
The knowledge state. I talked about this quite at length at last year's GDC, so I won't recap the system that we use,

546
00:23:12,426 --> 00:23:15,748
but we track everything that the player knows and everything that they need to know,

547
00:23:15,748 --> 00:23:18,990
and what leads their following using chains of knowledge.

548
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:23,673
Heaven's Vault has about, I don't know, 1,500 knowledge states or something, and we're constantly tracking that.

549
00:23:24,154 --> 00:23:28,735
We also, more interestingly, check what's just happened,

550
00:23:28,735 --> 00:23:31,315
both in the world and in the knowledge state.

551
00:23:31,315 --> 00:23:32,256
So you can say things like,

552
00:23:32,256 --> 00:23:34,076
have you recently learned a fact about this?

553
00:23:34,076 --> 00:23:36,077
Have you recently discovered that?

554
00:23:36,077 --> 00:23:37,237
Have you recently discovered this,

555
00:23:37,237 --> 00:23:38,517
but you haven't yet discovered that?

556
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:41,858
In which case, it might be a good idea to do this.

557
00:23:41,858 --> 00:23:44,799
We do that at the ink level using the turns since query.

558
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:47,311
So I said preconditions are great.

559
00:23:47,311 --> 00:23:49,152
I said atomic content is great.

560
00:23:49,152 --> 00:23:51,252
You're probably all just going, I don't really even see

561
00:23:51,252 --> 00:23:53,152
why that would be the case.

562
00:23:53,152 --> 00:23:55,153
So let me try and outline the benefits.

563
00:23:55,153 --> 00:23:57,793
And it's all human.

564
00:23:57,793 --> 00:24:02,014
I can author this stuff in a really responsive way.

565
00:24:02,014 --> 00:24:04,954
If I want to add an action to the game, or I want to add a

566
00:24:04,954 --> 00:24:07,015
line of dialogue to the game, I want to give the

567
00:24:07,015 --> 00:24:09,595
protagonist the ability to ask a particular question, I

568
00:24:09,595 --> 00:24:10,955
simply write that question down.

569
00:24:10,955 --> 00:24:13,456
And I say, when is this question appropriate?

570
00:24:13,456 --> 00:24:14,676
Well, to ask this question.

571
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:17,718
I need to know, she needs to know this fact.

572
00:24:17,718 --> 00:24:20,220
So, okay, test one, do you know that fact?

573
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,922
This question becomes redundant

574
00:24:21,922 --> 00:24:23,984
if she already knows the answer.

575
00:24:23,984 --> 00:24:25,185
So, second precondition,

576
00:24:25,185 --> 00:24:26,646
do you not already know the answer?

577
00:24:26,646 --> 00:24:27,727
Great, bung that in.

578
00:24:27,727 --> 00:24:29,268
Wait, no, this question doesn't make sense

579
00:24:29,268 --> 00:24:31,010
if I'm in the dark, because in the dark,

580
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:32,912
I don't want to ask questions about

581
00:24:32,912 --> 00:24:34,353
some random fact in the story.

582
00:24:34,353 --> 00:24:36,515
So if you're in the dark, that's a fail state,

583
00:24:36,515 --> 00:24:37,356
and so on and so forth.

584
00:24:37,356 --> 00:24:39,057
You just bung in all the preconditions.

585
00:24:39,057 --> 00:24:40,298
Wap, wap, wap, wap, wap, wap, wap, wap.

586
00:24:41,376 --> 00:24:46,940
And under every other circumstance where all of these things are met, fine, this thing might be what the game does.

587
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:51,383
You chuck it in a bucket, there are 60 things in the bucket, the game will pick something and it will always make sense.

588
00:24:51,383 --> 00:24:55,726
And if it doesn't make sense, well that's fine, you just put another precondition on it.

589
00:24:55,726 --> 00:24:57,047
Or you prioritize it.

590
00:24:57,047 --> 00:25:01,831
And the game will give you something sensible and something dynamic and something that moves things forward.

591
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:05,598
What I'm trying to say is that non-linear flows

592
00:25:05,598 --> 00:25:07,120
arise naturally from the system.

593
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,501
You don't have to author them.

594
00:25:08,501 --> 00:25:10,222
You don't need a branching tree to ensure

595
00:25:10,222 --> 00:25:11,623
that your game is non-linear.

596
00:25:11,623 --> 00:25:13,325
It can't be linear.

597
00:25:13,325 --> 00:25:15,546
It's effectively a deck of cards that you've shuffled

598
00:25:15,546 --> 00:25:16,988
and you're dealing them out,

599
00:25:16,988 --> 00:25:19,470
except that cards are only ever cards which are relevant.

600
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:20,931
It's a bit like the authoring structure

601
00:25:20,931 --> 00:25:23,553
that Lee Alexander outlined for Reigns, right?

602
00:25:23,553 --> 00:25:26,655
That's an atomized set of content with preconditions

603
00:25:26,655 --> 00:25:29,097
that say when a card is allowed to be released or not.

604
00:25:29,097 --> 00:25:30,218
It's exactly the same idea.

605
00:25:30,819 --> 00:25:36,001
Only ours is very, very flexible in terms of what that content can be,

606
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:39,142
because it can be anything, literally any action in the entire game.

607
00:25:39,142 --> 00:25:42,823
So, obviously there are issues.

608
00:25:42,823 --> 00:25:48,165
Well, the biggest issue, I hope, is probably what you think it is,

609
00:25:48,165 --> 00:25:52,367
if you've been sort of following the idea of what this is,

610
00:25:52,367 --> 00:25:54,828
that it's incredibly annoying to write.

611
00:25:55,808 --> 00:25:57,489
It's incredibly repetitive.

612
00:25:57,489 --> 00:25:59,851
Am I really saying that on every single option

613
00:25:59,851 --> 00:26:01,572
in the entire game, there are 20,000 lines of dialogue

614
00:26:01,572 --> 00:26:04,433
in this game already, I have to say,

615
00:26:04,433 --> 00:26:05,454
are you in the dark?

616
00:26:05,454 --> 00:26:07,195
Don't say this if you're in the dark.

617
00:26:07,195 --> 00:26:08,335
Have you just stubbed your toe?

618
00:26:08,335 --> 00:26:09,816
Don't say this if you've stubbed your toe.

619
00:26:09,816 --> 00:26:11,357
Are you having an argument with Six?

620
00:26:11,357 --> 00:26:11,997
Don't be nice to him.

621
00:26:11,997 --> 00:26:14,038
On every single line of dialogue,

622
00:26:14,038 --> 00:26:16,040
do I really have to list every single way

623
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,061
that this would be an inappropriate thing to say?

624
00:26:18,061 --> 00:26:19,722
And the answer is sort of, yeah.

625
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:24,932
I kind of do, because otherwise the game is going to say something stupid,

626
00:26:24,932 --> 00:26:27,654
because it's only a game. It doesn't know.

627
00:26:27,654 --> 00:26:31,677
But this is a problem we can tackle, and it's not even a difficult problem to tackle.

628
00:26:31,677 --> 00:26:36,420
The solution is exactly what a software engineer would tell you the solution was.

629
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,962
We use authoring patterns. In particular, we use scopes.

630
00:26:38,962 --> 00:26:43,905
So all of our content is scoped. So we write in buckets.

631
00:26:43,905 --> 00:26:44,806
We have four buckets.

632
00:26:45,508 --> 00:26:46,569
We have the moment bucket.

633
00:26:46,569 --> 00:26:48,730
This is a thing that's happening right now.

634
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:50,450
I am talking to you people right now.

635
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:52,131
So everything that I say to you right now

636
00:26:52,131 --> 00:26:53,992
will be about the topic that I'm talking about,

637
00:26:53,992 --> 00:26:56,713
hopefully, and I won't do some weird Freudian thing.

638
00:26:56,713 --> 00:26:57,933
But I'm not gonna start telling you

639
00:26:57,933 --> 00:26:58,633
about what I had for lunch.

640
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:02,080
because right now I am just looking at the options

641
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,082
that are available to me in this moment.

642
00:27:04,082 --> 00:27:06,123
So it's great for an argument, it's great for a set piece,

643
00:27:06,123 --> 00:27:07,423
it's great for a conversation, fine.

644
00:27:07,423 --> 00:27:09,144
That's just normal branching trees.

645
00:27:09,144 --> 00:27:11,646
They're little, but they still exist.

646
00:27:11,646 --> 00:27:14,847
If I am not in a moment context, then I'm in a room.

647
00:27:14,847 --> 00:27:17,169
We use rooms as our sort of base level interaction.

648
00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:19,850
So in a room, there are various things I could do.

649
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:21,231
If I was to come down from the podium,

650
00:27:21,231 --> 00:27:22,912
I could sit on a chair, I could go to the door,

651
00:27:22,912 --> 00:27:24,172
I could take the microphone, whatever.

652
00:27:24,172 --> 00:27:26,093
I could do things within this room.

653
00:27:26,634 --> 00:27:28,595
So when I want to author content for this room,

654
00:27:28,595 --> 00:27:29,856
I put it in the room bucket.

655
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:32,258
I put it in the hall bucket, and there we go, fill it up.

656
00:27:32,258 --> 00:27:35,000
If I have an idea for something I might do out in the hall,

657
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,241
well, I find that bucket, the room of the hall,

658
00:27:37,241 --> 00:27:38,782
and I put it in there instead.

659
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:40,904
So that scopes it geographically for me.

660
00:27:40,904 --> 00:27:43,026
And we have some markup to help Unity know

661
00:27:43,026 --> 00:27:44,206
what prop is this attached to.

662
00:27:44,206 --> 00:27:44,767
Can you see it?

663
00:27:44,767 --> 00:27:45,487
Can you touch it?

664
00:27:45,487 --> 00:27:46,068
That kind of thing.

665
00:27:47,292 --> 00:27:48,493
That includes dialogue.

666
00:27:48,493 --> 00:27:50,535
Most importantly, that includes dialogue.

667
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:52,016
There are things I might want to say

668
00:27:52,016 --> 00:27:53,497
because I'm in this room,

669
00:27:53,497 --> 00:27:55,759
but I don't want to say if I'm on the street outside.

670
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:58,061
So that allows Elle, our protagonist,

671
00:27:58,061 --> 00:27:59,802
to remove conversation options

672
00:27:59,802 --> 00:28:01,203
and gain conversation options

673
00:28:01,203 --> 00:28:03,525
based on where she happens to be standing in the world.

674
00:28:03,525 --> 00:28:03,745
Fine.

675
00:28:04,806 --> 00:28:11,007
If there is nothing in the room that she wants to talk about, then we drop back to episode level content.

676
00:28:11,007 --> 00:28:14,848
So we have another bucket. This is across a series of rooms that are relevant.

677
00:28:14,848 --> 00:28:19,609
So my episode at the moment is being in San Francisco and being a little bit jet-lagged but mostly okay,

678
00:28:19,609 --> 00:28:22,390
and my dialogue is all about being in San Francisco.

679
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:24,390
And I can say these lines of dialogue like,

680
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:25,910
gosh, isn't San Francisco a lovely city?

681
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:29,151
Or, gosh, you really do have a poverty problem, guys, you want to sort that out.

682
00:28:29,471 --> 00:28:32,194
and I can say that anywhere in San Francisco,

683
00:28:32,194 --> 00:28:34,596
and it's relevant and it's appropriate and it's apropos,

684
00:28:34,596 --> 00:28:36,798
so long as there's not something I should be saying

685
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:39,160
in the room context, like where's the coffee,

686
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,781
and so long as I'm not in the middle of a moment

687
00:28:40,781 --> 00:28:42,103
of delivering a lecture to you guys

688
00:28:42,103 --> 00:28:43,584
about something else completely.

689
00:28:43,584 --> 00:28:43,724
Fine.

690
00:28:43,724 --> 00:28:49,409
Okay, beyond that is the game scope.

691
00:28:50,819 --> 00:28:52,881
all the other things that she might say,

692
00:28:52,881 --> 00:28:53,982
all the things that could be relevant

693
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,063
at any given time at all.

694
00:28:55,063 --> 00:28:58,466
These are the things where she can synthesize information.

695
00:28:58,466 --> 00:28:59,547
She can reflect on information

696
00:28:59,547 --> 00:29:00,908
from multiple places in the game.

697
00:29:00,908 --> 00:29:02,790
She can draw things together.

698
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:05,653
She can bridge one episode to another episode.

699
00:29:05,653 --> 00:29:08,676
And that basically sits at the bottom of the hierarchy

700
00:29:08,676 --> 00:29:10,317
because it's the one that can come up anytime.

701
00:29:10,317 --> 00:29:13,340
So the content is shadowed,

702
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,021
each scope shadowing the next.

703
00:29:16,837 --> 00:29:18,758
And this is brilliant, right?

704
00:29:18,758 --> 00:29:21,539
This is really brilliant because it partly removes

705
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:22,699
huge amounts of the preconditions

706
00:29:22,699 --> 00:29:25,320
because the scope just says this is the scope,

707
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,460
so it's fine.

708
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:29,101
It has a prioritization system,

709
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:30,661
but for me as a human being,

710
00:29:30,661 --> 00:29:33,442
it's very easy for me to decide where to put my content.

711
00:29:33,442 --> 00:29:35,603
If I'm writing a dialogue about the history of robots

712
00:29:35,603 --> 00:29:37,503
in the universe, that's game scope, fine.

713
00:29:37,503 --> 00:29:40,464
If I'm writing a line of dialogue about the planet I'm on,

714
00:29:40,464 --> 00:29:41,504
that's episode scope.

715
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:43,465
If I'm writing the line of dialogue about whether

716
00:29:43,465 --> 00:29:45,546
this door is gonna be openable, that's room scope.

717
00:29:45,546 --> 00:29:46,286
This is trivial.

718
00:29:46,806 --> 00:29:49,647
It takes no time at all to work out where you're going to put your bit of content.

719
00:29:49,647 --> 00:29:51,688
You just bung it straight in and move forward.

720
00:29:51,688 --> 00:29:55,470
So you get all the benefits of additive, atomized content

721
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:57,771
without having to worry too much about structure.

722
00:29:57,771 --> 00:30:01,312
Well, in fact, without having to worry at all about structure,

723
00:30:01,312 --> 00:30:04,074
and that's the other big problem,

724
00:30:04,074 --> 00:30:06,074
when you atomize all your content,

725
00:30:06,074 --> 00:30:08,515
you don't have a way of enforcing structure,

726
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:10,917
by which I mean long-term plot structure.

727
00:30:11,719 --> 00:30:14,841
To say at the beginning of the game people should be very sort of kind to each other

728
00:30:14,841 --> 00:30:18,564
and by the end of the game they should say big dramatic exciting things because most

729
00:30:18,564 --> 00:30:21,827
of your content doesn't know when it's happening unless you write a precondition to tell it

730
00:30:21,827 --> 00:30:22,728
when it's happening.

731
00:30:22,728 --> 00:30:23,368
It can get very messy.

732
00:30:24,465 --> 00:30:27,106
So the one thing that we needed to add to this system,

733
00:30:27,106 --> 00:30:29,727
this all works, it's fine, it's running,

734
00:30:29,727 --> 00:30:32,868
was something to enforce long-term narrative structure

735
00:30:32,868 --> 00:30:35,069
because we do want that.

736
00:30:35,069 --> 00:30:37,390
So I said earlier that the system is a little bit like

737
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:38,550
the system in Reigns.

738
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,451
If you think about the way Reigns works,

739
00:30:40,451 --> 00:30:41,752
you die and then you loop back

740
00:30:41,752 --> 00:30:43,272
and that's its long-term narrative structure.

741
00:30:43,272 --> 00:30:45,553
It's built in these little loops.

742
00:30:45,553 --> 00:30:47,574
We basically do the same thing

743
00:30:47,574 --> 00:30:49,915
except without dying and resetting you,

744
00:30:49,915 --> 00:30:51,076
but instead moving you forwards

745
00:30:51,076 --> 00:30:53,597
and that's why we use episodes.

746
00:30:54,597 --> 00:30:56,638
So, is everybody still alive?

747
00:30:56,638 --> 00:31:00,240
Good, let's do something even harder.

748
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,562
This is the structure of Heaven's Roll, right?

749
00:31:03,562 --> 00:31:05,944
It is an open world of locations.

750
00:31:05,944 --> 00:31:07,524
Some of them are revisitable,

751
00:31:07,524 --> 00:31:09,746
some of them you can only visit once

752
00:31:09,746 --> 00:31:10,946
because once you visit it,

753
00:31:10,946 --> 00:31:12,427
there's nothing more there to find.

754
00:31:12,427 --> 00:31:15,069
The player chooses a location to visit

755
00:31:15,069 --> 00:31:15,869
to continue the story.

756
00:31:15,869 --> 00:31:16,930
They look at the map and say,

757
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:18,591
what's available, I'll go to that one.

758
00:31:18,591 --> 00:31:20,232
It's nearby, it looks interesting, whatever.

759
00:31:21,317 --> 00:31:23,037
Fine. When they reach a location,

760
00:31:23,037 --> 00:31:24,818
they initiate an episode of content.

761
00:31:24,818 --> 00:31:26,178
They land on it and they're sort of locked

762
00:31:26,178 --> 00:31:28,840
into that episode until they're done with it.

763
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,480
They play through it.

764
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,920
That gives them a nice, well-defined,

765
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,001
I've started off, I know why I'm here,

766
00:31:33,001 --> 00:31:36,182
I know what I have to do or what I maybe have to do.

767
00:31:36,182 --> 00:31:37,403
And then I know when I'm going to end it

768
00:31:37,403 --> 00:31:39,124
and then I can move on.

769
00:31:39,124 --> 00:31:41,224
I kind of think of it as shadow of the Colossus.

770
00:31:41,224 --> 00:31:43,085
If you could discover where the Colossi were

771
00:31:43,085 --> 00:31:44,946
in any order and visit them in any order.

772
00:31:44,946 --> 00:31:46,426
And then you pick which one you want to do

773
00:31:46,426 --> 00:31:47,547
when you want to do it and you go and do it.

774
00:31:47,547 --> 00:31:49,027
And once you're doing it, you're doing it.

775
00:31:49,027 --> 00:31:49,968
Done it is done.

776
00:31:49,968 --> 00:31:50,128
Yeah?

777
00:31:52,374 --> 00:31:55,096
And crucially, locations can only be landed on,

778
00:31:55,096 --> 00:31:58,039
they can only be chosen if you've got a reason to go there.

779
00:31:58,039 --> 00:31:59,040
So we don't have any dead air,

780
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,681
we don't have any wandering around randomly.

781
00:32:00,681 --> 00:32:03,424
This is not an open world in the classic sense.

782
00:32:03,424 --> 00:32:05,245
When I was wandering around the world of L.A. Noire,

783
00:32:05,245 --> 00:32:07,027
I had no idea why I was wandering around the world

784
00:32:07,027 --> 00:32:09,149
of L.A. Noire, because there was absolutely nothing to do

785
00:32:09,149 --> 00:32:10,950
in any of it at all.

786
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:12,632
So I don't know why they built it.

787
00:32:12,632 --> 00:32:14,394
And I still don't know why they built it.

788
00:32:14,394 --> 00:32:17,076
Well, we're not doing that, because that's silly.

789
00:32:17,076 --> 00:32:18,457
And we're also only eight people.

790
00:32:20,474 --> 00:32:24,037
When you land on an episode, the episode flow works like this.

791
00:32:24,037 --> 00:32:25,719
Well, the episode is unlocked by previous events.

792
00:32:25,719 --> 00:32:27,701
It begins, the player explores, they wander around,

793
00:32:27,701 --> 00:32:29,763
they trigger all this atomized content

794
00:32:29,763 --> 00:32:31,925
based on the preconditions of the room or the state

795
00:32:31,925 --> 00:32:33,466
or what they know or what they don't know.

796
00:32:33,466 --> 00:32:35,708
That all just surfaces up from the content bucket.

797
00:32:35,708 --> 00:32:38,871
I'm not actually in control of that, really, as an author.

798
00:32:38,871 --> 00:32:42,294
I'm not in control of the order in which it appears

799
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:44,196
unless I specifically tell a piece of content

800
00:32:44,196 --> 00:32:45,878
that it has to follow another piece of content.

801
00:32:46,572 --> 00:32:49,774
Quite often what we're doing with the dialogue is we're saying,

802
00:32:49,774 --> 00:32:54,356
this remark is relevant if you've just spoken about this topic.

803
00:32:54,356 --> 00:32:57,657
So if you say it, you don't make the reply, you wander off,

804
00:32:57,657 --> 00:33:00,479
this reply dies and it never comes back. That happens all the time.

805
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:03,800
And so conversations can quite naturally feed off one way,

806
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,681
something else can get forgotten about, the player can pursue interests,

807
00:33:06,681 --> 00:33:07,222
let other things go.

808
00:33:07,222 --> 00:33:10,323
Somewhere along the line they reach a minimum exit condition.

809
00:33:11,123 --> 00:33:15,568
That's a condition which allows the protagonist to say, reasonably,

810
00:33:15,568 --> 00:33:22,094
I want to leave now. That's always narrative. It has to be. It's not, there's no point in it

811
00:33:22,094 --> 00:33:25,918
otherwise. It has to be, I think I've seen enough, or I don't think I can open that door,

812
00:33:25,918 --> 00:33:29,181
or I don't know why I'm here in the first place, or I've completely cased the joint,

813
00:33:29,181 --> 00:33:32,204
let's get out of here. All of those would satisfy your minimum exit condition.

814
00:33:32,204 --> 00:33:34,646
You've landed on the moon, you've wandered around a bit, you go.

815
00:33:35,537 --> 00:33:39,520
If you don't go, you keep exploring for a while until you reach the maximum exit condition.

816
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:43,083
The maximum exit condition is the one that we don't want anyone ever to see.

817
00:33:43,083 --> 00:33:45,565
It's the point where the robot trundles up to you and says,

818
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:48,467
Seriously, you have picked up everything. You have opened every cupboard.

819
00:33:48,467 --> 00:33:51,389
You have looked at everything. We've got nothing.

820
00:33:51,389 --> 00:33:52,030
Please leave.

821
00:33:53,293 --> 00:33:55,594
Get out! It's the one where we start turning the lights off.

822
00:33:55,594 --> 00:33:59,376
It's the one where literally we start not letting you walk through open doors anymore

823
00:33:59,376 --> 00:34:01,317
and putting invisible collision in the way.

824
00:34:01,317 --> 00:34:04,099
It's the thing where we just hustle you towards the exits,

825
00:34:04,099 --> 00:34:06,360
like they do if you stay late in Disneyland.

826
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,321
And like all these guys who were previously friendly and dressed as Winnie the Pooh

827
00:34:09,321 --> 00:34:12,043
suddenly become these menacing Fortnite-style bears

828
00:34:12,043 --> 00:34:13,724
that are slowly easing you towards the exit.

829
00:34:13,724 --> 00:34:15,525
And if you slip past one age 10, they come for you.

830
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:21,892
So we do that to our players.

831
00:34:21,892 --> 00:34:25,375
And in the meantime, remember there's still the game scope,

832
00:34:25,375 --> 00:34:27,436
right, the game scope still exists.

833
00:34:27,436 --> 00:34:28,937
So in the background of this episode,

834
00:34:28,937 --> 00:34:30,818
if there's ever a pause, fine,

835
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:32,700
they'll talk about what happened in the last episode.

836
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:33,941
They'll talk about how this episode

837
00:34:33,941 --> 00:34:34,801
and that episode connect.

838
00:34:34,801 --> 00:34:37,123
They'll talk about how Six is a really annoying robot.

839
00:34:37,123 --> 00:34:39,665
Six will say, why am I called Six anyway?

840
00:34:39,665 --> 00:34:42,527
All of these background things can filter in

841
00:34:42,527 --> 00:34:43,527
when there's a gap.

842
00:34:43,527 --> 00:34:44,989
So we've always got something to talk about.

843
00:34:44,989 --> 00:34:46,009
So we're always moving forward.

844
00:34:46,009 --> 00:34:47,911
So there's no dead air in our game.

845
00:34:48,511 --> 00:34:50,392
That's never been possible for us before.

846
00:34:50,392 --> 00:34:55,833
In 80 Days, we couldn't have Passepartout and Fogg idly chat about something

847
00:34:55,833 --> 00:34:59,675
in the middle of another adventure because it was an authored tree.

848
00:34:59,675 --> 00:35:03,396
We sort of hacked it so that towards the end of a story in 80 Days,

849
00:35:03,396 --> 00:35:06,057
towards the end of your journey, they would start to say,

850
00:35:06,057 --> 00:35:07,057
it's day 75, let's get a move on.

851
00:35:08,738 --> 00:35:10,160
But that was totally fudged in.

852
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,942
It was just a bit of tree shoved on the end

853
00:35:11,942 --> 00:35:13,163
of every other bit of tree,

854
00:35:13,163 --> 00:35:15,846
and it's probably got some really awkward segues.

855
00:35:15,846 --> 00:35:17,828
It doesn't have this free form structure

856
00:35:17,828 --> 00:35:19,330
that arises naturally from the fact

857
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:22,313
that you're wandering around a world trying to fill space.

858
00:35:22,313 --> 00:35:24,376
It is a completely different structure,

859
00:35:24,376 --> 00:35:26,238
despite, I think, having a similar philosophy.

860
00:35:26,238 --> 00:35:26,278
So.

861
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,521
We have episodes.

862
00:35:30,521 --> 00:35:32,502
They let us structure the content

863
00:35:32,502 --> 00:35:34,143
and get some sense of progression.

864
00:35:34,143 --> 00:35:36,104
So the question that remains is,

865
00:35:36,104 --> 00:35:39,426
how do you unlock a new episode?

866
00:35:39,426 --> 00:35:42,928
And I called this talk,

867
00:35:42,928 --> 00:35:44,529
creating a dynamic detective story.

868
00:35:44,529 --> 00:35:47,331
And I haven't mentioned detectives once, I think.

869
00:35:47,331 --> 00:35:48,811
So anyone here in your deerstalker hats

870
00:35:48,811 --> 00:35:50,152
will be very disappointed.

871
00:35:50,152 --> 00:35:53,114
So here's a detectivey word to make you feel better.

872
00:35:53,114 --> 00:35:55,215
Episodes are unlocked by following leads.

873
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:59,492
We borrowed the structure from Raymond Chandler, basically.

874
00:35:59,492 --> 00:36:01,313
In a Raymond Chandler story, Philip Marlowe goes

875
00:36:01,313 --> 00:36:03,595
to the dead man's apartment and finds a laundry ticket

876
00:36:03,595 --> 00:36:05,537
in the dead man's coat, which takes him to the laundromat

877
00:36:05,537 --> 00:36:07,719
where he meets the woman who takes him to the jazz club

878
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:09,620
where he gets hit on the head and he wakes up on the boat

879
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,941
where he meets the mysterious doctor.

880
00:36:10,941 --> 00:36:12,723
So he goes to the mysterious doctor and so on and so forth.

881
00:36:12,723 --> 00:36:15,725
Every location he goes to is unlocked by her lead

882
00:36:15,725 --> 00:36:17,066
he finds in the previous location.

883
00:36:17,066 --> 00:36:18,647
Perhaps a big one, perhaps a small one.

884
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:22,252
We do the same thing again, which is to say,

885
00:36:22,252 --> 00:36:27,294
every episode in the game is unlocked by preconditions.

886
00:36:27,294 --> 00:36:30,416
Again, just as we use for the atoms of the story,

887
00:36:30,416 --> 00:36:32,797
the larger atoms, the episodes of the story

888
00:36:32,797 --> 00:36:33,837
are also preconditioned.

889
00:36:33,837 --> 00:36:36,158
So when we're in the open world,

890
00:36:36,158 --> 00:36:38,459
and we're trying to say, what are we gonna do next?

891
00:36:38,459 --> 00:36:39,760
What's our next episode gonna be?

892
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,481
It might look like this, it's a bucket of content.

893
00:36:41,481 --> 00:36:44,082
The red ones, the preconditions have failed,

894
00:36:44,082 --> 00:36:44,822
for some reason.

895
00:36:44,822 --> 00:36:46,663
The gray ones, well, actually,

896
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:48,064
just the preconditions have failed.

897
00:36:48,684 --> 00:36:52,728
but they're probably ones where the precondition was only do this once.

898
00:36:52,728 --> 00:36:54,370
So the tutorial will have a condition that says,

899
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:56,632
have you done the tutorial? Don't do the tutorial again.

900
00:36:56,632 --> 00:36:57,934
And that's fine.

901
00:36:57,934 --> 00:37:01,898
The green ones are ones where I have passed my precondition.

902
00:37:01,898 --> 00:37:03,439
I have a reason to go there.

903
00:37:03,439 --> 00:37:05,681
There's a farming village where I have a contact.

904
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:07,844
I haven't spoken to him in a while, so I could check in.

905
00:37:07,844 --> 00:37:09,946
Narrative reason, precondition valid.

906
00:37:09,946 --> 00:37:10,766
I can choose that option.

907
00:37:11,737 --> 00:37:14,538
I've got an old sword, I can trace its location, great.

908
00:37:14,538 --> 00:37:16,999
That gives me a reason to launch that episode.

909
00:37:16,999 --> 00:37:19,080
I saw a mention of something in a document,

910
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,721
I can follow it up, that gives me a choice

911
00:37:20,721 --> 00:37:22,422
and a reason to enter that episode.

912
00:37:22,422 --> 00:37:26,384
So this is kind of interesting,

913
00:37:26,384 --> 00:37:29,446
because this basically means

914
00:37:30,175 --> 00:37:33,537
Every location in the game, every episode in the game,

915
00:37:33,537 --> 00:37:37,379
has a set of reasons why it's allowed to be played.

916
00:37:37,379 --> 00:37:38,820
And it just sort of sits there and waits

917
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,081
until those reasons are met.

918
00:37:40,081 --> 00:37:42,083
And then it says, okay, you can play me now if you want to.

919
00:37:42,083 --> 00:37:46,405
This allows us to have a completely non-linear flow

920
00:37:46,405 --> 00:37:47,686
through the story.

921
00:37:47,686 --> 00:37:50,508
You might do the farming village.

922
00:37:50,508 --> 00:37:51,989
You might do the empire barracks.

923
00:37:51,989 --> 00:37:53,390
You might do the empire barracks as level three,

924
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:55,391
or you might do it as level 10.

925
00:37:55,391 --> 00:37:57,032
I, as the author, have no control over that,

926
00:37:57,032 --> 00:37:59,334
unless I explicitly put in a precondition about it.

927
00:38:00,412 --> 00:38:04,075
What that means is that we can build 15 locations,

928
00:38:04,075 --> 00:38:06,057
but generate an entirely nonlinear flow

929
00:38:06,057 --> 00:38:07,558
through those locations,

930
00:38:07,558 --> 00:38:09,460
so we solve our redundancy problem.

931
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,261
We've always got something new to give you,

932
00:38:11,261 --> 00:38:13,403
even though we can't actually build a new level.

933
00:38:13,403 --> 00:38:13,523
Cool.

934
00:38:13,523 --> 00:38:14,844
That's very nice.

935
00:38:14,844 --> 00:38:16,906
That's terribly clever.

936
00:38:16,906 --> 00:38:17,267
Great.

937
00:38:17,267 --> 00:38:18,508
Does that work?

938
00:38:18,508 --> 00:38:19,428
Well, I think it does.

939
00:38:19,428 --> 00:38:20,890
Yeah, it seems to be working.

940
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:22,191
There is a problem.

941
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:26,012
So, I really want to stress, so far I started with this idea of player freedom,

942
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:29,934
and I tried to solve the problem of doing that in a 3D world, so I atomized all my content.

943
00:38:29,934 --> 00:38:32,515
But then I had to solve the problem of structure, so then we made episodes.

944
00:38:32,515 --> 00:38:36,257
But then I had to solve the problem of how to unlock episodes, so I put preconditions on that.

945
00:38:36,257 --> 00:38:39,939
And now I have to solve another problem. So at this point I really want to just make a game.

946
00:38:39,939 --> 00:38:43,060
But we're really close, but we've got one last thing.

947
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:48,063
And I think this is the only bit of this which is, I think, original, and I think quite clever.

948
00:38:49,358 --> 00:38:53,922
And that's the problem that arises in all detective games.

949
00:38:53,922 --> 00:38:55,324
And I don't mean deduction mechanics,

950
00:38:55,324 --> 00:38:58,627
even though they are almost always appalling.

951
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:01,789
But it's this, that if you have a detective moving around,

952
00:39:01,789 --> 00:39:04,612
some players are that detective,

953
00:39:04,612 --> 00:39:06,553
and other players are that detective,

954
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:10,557
and both of them have a terrible experience.

955
00:39:11,836 --> 00:39:14,537
Now when I played L.A. Noire, I think I was,

956
00:39:14,537 --> 00:39:16,698
I don't even know, I wasn't even either of these.

957
00:39:16,698 --> 00:39:18,879
When I played L.A. Noire, I was like a rumba.

958
00:39:18,879 --> 00:39:20,200
I just went around the corner of the room

959
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,720
collecting everything until I stopped,

960
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,741
which is neither really.

961
00:39:22,741 --> 00:39:25,402
I don't think I engaged my brain at any point,

962
00:39:25,402 --> 00:39:26,082
which was a shame.

963
00:39:26,082 --> 00:39:28,404
But what we really want to do

964
00:39:28,404 --> 00:39:31,185
for our narrative adventure experience game type thing

965
00:39:31,185 --> 00:39:34,947
is ensure that everybody discovers just enough.

966
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,101
We want them to just have enough.

967
00:39:38,101 --> 00:39:41,702
Raymond Chandler writes that you go to the dead man's apartment, you get the laundry

968
00:39:41,702 --> 00:39:43,443
ticket from his coat, you go to the laundromat.

969
00:39:43,443 --> 00:39:46,965
You don't go to the dead man's apartment, pick up seven pieces of laundry, get his laundry

970
00:39:46,965 --> 00:39:50,366
in a bag for him, get his detergent, then go to the laundromat.

971
00:39:50,927 --> 00:39:55,490
then meet the entire jazz band in the laundromat and go with all of them to the jazz club.

972
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:57,851
That's not how he plays it.

973
00:39:57,851 --> 00:40:00,333
He's a bit more skilled than that and hopefully we can be too.

974
00:40:00,333 --> 00:40:02,014
But how do we do that?

975
00:40:02,014 --> 00:40:04,456
Because if we've written all this atomized content,

976
00:40:04,456 --> 00:40:06,497
well, if you find it, you find it.

977
00:40:06,497 --> 00:40:08,538
And if you don't find it, you don't find it.

978
00:40:08,538 --> 00:40:11,320
So how on earth can we manage what you found

979
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,882
when we've made a big bucket of atomized bits of content?

980
00:40:14,882 --> 00:40:15,823
We've got no way in.

981
00:40:17,534 --> 00:40:19,816
So what do we do?

982
00:40:19,816 --> 00:40:22,138
And like I say, I think this is clever.

983
00:40:22,138 --> 00:40:23,459
We'll see.

984
00:40:23,459 --> 00:40:26,662
We make our evidence chains highly procedural.

985
00:40:28,373 --> 00:40:35,535
So when the player finds something, I as the author have no idea what it is you're going to find.

986
00:40:35,535 --> 00:40:40,176
I say, this is a good place to find something. Inside the guy's coat, that's a good place to

987
00:40:40,176 --> 00:40:45,818
find something. And the evidence that's actually found is generated on demand at that moment and

988
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:50,719
strictly for purpose. We do that by triangulating things. We say, what makes sense here? What kind

989
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:53,400
of things can I have in a dead man's coat? Well, I can have a laundry chit.

990
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:56,060
I can have a matchbook from a jazz club.

991
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:57,761
I can have a ticket for the boat.

992
00:40:57,761 --> 00:40:59,481
Those are all locations in my world.

993
00:40:59,481 --> 00:41:01,962
I probably can't have a Kalashnikov.

994
00:41:01,962 --> 00:41:03,482
And I certainly can't have a tiger skin rug.

995
00:41:03,482 --> 00:41:06,643
So don't generate those things.

996
00:41:06,643 --> 00:41:08,083
I say, what does the story need?

997
00:41:08,083 --> 00:41:09,564
Well, right now I really want the player

998
00:41:09,564 --> 00:41:10,584
to go to this laundromat.

999
00:41:10,584 --> 00:41:11,644
You should see how they smell.

1000
00:41:11,644 --> 00:41:12,624
Their shoes look dirty.

1001
00:41:12,624 --> 00:41:13,345
Let's get them there.

1002
00:41:14,365 --> 00:41:15,868
And I said, what does the game need?

1003
00:41:15,868 --> 00:41:17,070
What would be interesting?

1004
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:19,233
We keep finding laundromat tickets.

1005
00:41:19,233 --> 00:41:21,096
Stop finding laundromat tickets.

1006
00:41:21,096 --> 00:41:23,340
Find something that isn't a laundromat ticket.

1007
00:41:24,102 --> 00:41:26,104
Okay, we triangulate those three and we say,

1008
00:41:26,104 --> 00:41:27,985
aha, oh wait, I've mixed my metaphors.

1009
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,206
I'm back in archeology now.

1010
00:41:29,206 --> 00:41:31,008
I've found an ancient ring with the seal

1011
00:41:31,008 --> 00:41:32,809
of an unknown king that was dropped here.

1012
00:41:32,809 --> 00:41:34,971
And that's what our protagonist will say.

1013
00:41:34,971 --> 00:41:38,254
It's appropriate because it's a small object

1014
00:41:38,254 --> 00:41:40,436
and I found it in a place where small objects can be found.

1015
00:41:40,436 --> 00:41:42,377
It's what the story needs.

1016
00:41:42,377 --> 00:41:44,759
I want my player to go to this palace.

1017
00:41:44,759 --> 00:41:46,741
So I want to give them an artifact from that palace

1018
00:41:46,741 --> 00:41:48,683
so they can have a narrative reason to go there.

1019
00:41:48,683 --> 00:41:49,383
And it's interesting.

1020
00:41:49,603 --> 00:41:51,865
Because it's an ancient ring with the seal of an unknown king.

1021
00:41:51,865 --> 00:41:54,387
Who doesn't like an ancient ring with the seal of an unknown king?

1022
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:56,088
Everybody wants one of those.

1023
00:41:56,088 --> 00:42:05,474
So, we glue the narrative together using procedural elements.

1024
00:42:05,474 --> 00:42:08,056
If you're Poirot and you find all the clues,

1025
00:42:08,056 --> 00:42:09,957
at some point the procedural system would say,

1026
00:42:09,957 --> 00:42:11,899
I've got nothing for you.

1027
00:42:11,899 --> 00:42:14,941
And our character will lean down, turn over a rock and say,

1028
00:42:14,941 --> 00:42:17,883
there's something here. Oh, no, no, no, there's nothing.

1029
00:42:17,883 --> 00:42:18,543
And she'll carry on.

1030
00:42:19,938 --> 00:42:22,659
Which is fine, because that player's already got everything they need,

1031
00:42:22,659 --> 00:42:25,920
and they need to stop farming the location and get out of the level.

1032
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,801
That's okay, we haven't even lost them.

1033
00:42:28,801 --> 00:42:29,861
So we've got a ton of benefits.

1034
00:42:29,861 --> 00:42:32,541
There's no need to scour the location.

1035
00:42:32,541 --> 00:42:36,642
I, as the adventure game player in L.A. Noire, do not need to rumble the room,

1036
00:42:36,642 --> 00:42:40,363
because I will find the content I need by looking in the places that are interesting.

1037
00:42:40,363 --> 00:42:41,904
I'll check the cupboard, I'll check under the bed,

1038
00:42:41,904 --> 00:42:45,364
I'll check the wardrobe, I've found a couple of things, I've got a lead, I'm good.

1039
00:42:45,364 --> 00:42:48,585
I don't need to worry that there might have been something in the toilet.

1040
00:42:49,622 --> 00:42:52,004
Whereas when I'm playing LA Noire, I have to worry about that.

1041
00:42:52,004 --> 00:42:52,985
I have to go and check it.

1042
00:42:52,985 --> 00:42:55,467
And then having checked it, I have to check that I really did check it.

1043
00:42:55,467 --> 00:42:58,149
And that's the standard experience of adventure games,

1044
00:42:58,149 --> 00:43:00,771
is you walk into an area, you case it, you case it again.

1045
00:43:00,771 --> 00:43:04,755
And then when you're stuck, you go, oh no, and you case it again.

1046
00:43:04,755 --> 00:43:06,837
And then, variably, you missed something.

1047
00:43:06,837 --> 00:43:08,378
Well, you don't need to do that here.

1048
00:43:08,378 --> 00:43:12,402
The adage is always that things are in the last place you look.

1049
00:43:12,402 --> 00:43:14,023
Well, they are.

1050
00:43:14,023 --> 00:43:14,764
That's where we put them.

1051
00:43:17,771 --> 00:43:21,254
we can control the unlock curve of the entire game.

1052
00:43:21,254 --> 00:43:22,515
We couldn't do that before.

1053
00:43:22,515 --> 00:43:23,576
That was the problem.

1054
00:43:23,576 --> 00:43:25,418
Atomized content meant that we had no way

1055
00:43:25,418 --> 00:43:26,959
of controlling the unlock curve of the game,

1056
00:43:26,959 --> 00:43:28,521
but now I've moved it up into code.

1057
00:43:28,521 --> 00:43:31,143
The procedural evidence generator

1058
00:43:31,143 --> 00:43:34,146
is the thing that decides what locations should I unlock,

1059
00:43:34,146 --> 00:43:34,906
when, how quickly.

1060
00:43:36,132 --> 00:43:37,993
And I can tweak that as much as I like,

1061
00:43:37,993 --> 00:43:42,336
and I affect the entire game by tweaking my generation code.

1062
00:43:42,336 --> 00:43:44,758
And I affect all of the games, regardless of the order

1063
00:43:44,758 --> 00:43:45,958
that you're playing the game in.

1064
00:43:45,958 --> 00:43:48,540
Remember, this is an inherently nonlinear flow.

1065
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:52,162
But I've got one point of entry to control the unlock curve

1066
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:55,444
of all possible games without reducing any player freedom,

1067
00:43:55,444 --> 00:43:56,705
without restricting anyone in any way.

1068
00:43:56,705 --> 00:43:58,466
I think that's really clever.

1069
00:43:58,466 --> 00:44:00,047
I think that's really useful.

1070
00:44:00,047 --> 00:44:02,889
And I think it's gonna make Heaven's Vault flow nicely.

1071
00:44:02,889 --> 00:44:04,770
But we won't find out that for another year, at least.

1072
00:44:06,234 --> 00:44:10,543
Best of all, writers do not need to be responsible for balancing the information, because writers

1073
00:44:10,543 --> 00:44:13,930
should not be allowed to be responsible for balancing information, because writers are

1074
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:15,473
cavalier and they don't understand things.

1075
00:44:15,473 --> 00:44:16,796
I am also a writer.

1076
00:44:18,808 --> 00:44:20,409
They can put in real leads.

1077
00:44:20,409 --> 00:44:22,270
If you want to meet the jazz singer in the laundromat,

1078
00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:23,910
that's fine, write her in,

1079
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:25,431
let her talk about the jazz club,

1080
00:44:25,431 --> 00:44:26,572
handle the fact that the player

1081
00:44:26,572 --> 00:44:27,832
might already have been there,

1082
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:28,812
handle the fact that the player

1083
00:44:28,812 --> 00:44:30,413
might not know what a jazz is,

1084
00:44:30,413 --> 00:44:32,354
deal with those possibilities, that's your job.

1085
00:44:32,354 --> 00:44:34,375
The procedural system would say,

1086
00:44:34,375 --> 00:44:36,076
oh, they've got a lead to the jazz club,

1087
00:44:36,076 --> 00:44:38,077
so we don't need to give them as much evidence for that.

1088
00:44:38,077 --> 00:44:40,217
Maybe a single matchbook with the name will be enough

1089
00:44:40,217 --> 00:44:41,478
and they can connect it themselves.

1090
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:41,618
Fine.

1091
00:44:44,078 --> 00:44:46,501
There's no redundant information, as I said.

1092
00:44:46,501 --> 00:44:48,423
Poirot eventually runs out of stuff.

1093
00:44:48,423 --> 00:44:49,624
You don't have players saying,

1094
00:44:49,624 --> 00:44:52,027
I've come to the jazz club because I've found 15 clues

1095
00:44:52,027 --> 00:44:52,648
to come here.

1096
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:54,049
I know I need to go to the jazz club.

1097
00:44:54,049 --> 00:44:55,090
I'll go to the jazz club.

1098
00:44:55,090 --> 00:44:57,112
I'm really sorry I haven't been to the jazz club yet.

1099
00:44:57,112 --> 00:44:58,634
That's good.

1100
00:44:58,634 --> 00:44:59,315
That's great.

1101
00:44:59,315 --> 00:45:01,417
We don't have unnecessary clues.

1102
00:45:01,417 --> 00:45:02,939
You have just enough evidence.

1103
00:45:03,635 --> 00:45:05,376
And better players are still rewarded.

1104
00:45:05,376 --> 00:45:06,757
If you follow more interesting leads,

1105
00:45:06,757 --> 00:45:08,518
you can get more authored content,

1106
00:45:08,518 --> 00:45:10,959
you can get more interesting evidence,

1107
00:45:10,959 --> 00:45:12,420
and not the procedural stuff.

1108
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:13,580
And that's obviously better

1109
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:15,041
because it's gonna be hand-authored.

1110
00:45:15,041 --> 00:45:15,842
So that's fine too.

1111
00:45:17,135 --> 00:45:21,017
Finally, we can also feed the procedurally generated clues directly back into the narrative

1112
00:45:21,017 --> 00:45:25,079
because we have a precondition-based system, right? That's a lot of long words, what do I mean?

1113
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:29,881
I mean, if you find the ring of an ancient king, you can take it to a shop that buys rings and sell

1114
00:45:29,881 --> 00:45:35,543
it. You can sell it for a piece of genuine, specific, contentful information in the story.

1115
00:45:35,543 --> 00:45:39,365
If you find a knife, you can use it to cut things. If you find a book, you can open it and you can

1116
00:45:39,365 --> 00:45:44,747
read something from inside it. So we can take procedurally generated items and give them

1117
00:45:44,747 --> 00:45:46,108
narrative detail.

1118
00:45:47,275 --> 00:45:49,556
that narrative detail may or may not ever surface

1119
00:45:49,556 --> 00:45:51,477
because the procedural generation may or may not ever

1120
00:45:51,477 --> 00:45:53,198
generate the correct artifact.

1121
00:45:53,198 --> 00:45:55,479
But I don't care because I've got a big content bucket

1122
00:45:55,479 --> 00:45:56,420
and I just chuck stuff in.

1123
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,521
If I have a joke which only applies

1124
00:45:58,521 --> 00:46:00,822
to knives made of crystal, I'll write it and say,

1125
00:46:00,822 --> 00:46:02,642
if you've got a crystal knife, there's your joke.

1126
00:46:02,642 --> 00:46:03,583
If you don't, nevermind.

1127
00:46:03,583 --> 00:46:06,104
And I can do that and I can keep doing that

1128
00:46:06,104 --> 00:46:08,885
right up until release without breaking the unlock curve,

1129
00:46:08,885 --> 00:46:11,066
without breaking anything in the system.

1130
00:46:11,066 --> 00:46:12,487
I can just keep throwing stuff in.

1131
00:46:13,165 --> 00:46:17,543
In fact, the only problem we really have is the frame rate of the story processing, but that's not my problem, that's Joe's.

1132
00:46:19,553 --> 00:46:24,376
So overall, the game loop for our narrative adventure game thingy with high player freedom looks like this.

1133
00:46:24,376 --> 00:46:30,020
You select an episode, you go into the episode, you do the episode content, you collect procedural leads as and when you need to,

1134
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:33,082
you exit, you go into the open world, there are available episodes,

1135
00:46:33,082 --> 00:46:37,666
and for players who have completely failed to get anything from any of the episodes,

1136
00:46:37,666 --> 00:46:42,109
you can get a procedural lead inside the open world via some kind of grindy pickup.

1137
00:46:42,109 --> 00:46:44,711
So if you're really useless at story games...

1138
00:46:45,071 --> 00:46:47,752
or you really don't want to find anything or do anything,

1139
00:46:47,752 --> 00:46:50,173
then I have no idea why you're still playing our game,

1140
00:46:50,173 --> 00:46:52,014
but you're grinding your way around the open world,

1141
00:46:52,014 --> 00:46:53,274
collecting procedural leads,

1142
00:46:53,274 --> 00:46:55,275
which seem to be fine for people in The Witcher

1143
00:46:55,275 --> 00:46:57,235
and Horizon Zero Dawn and all those other games

1144
00:46:57,235 --> 00:46:59,296
that make you pick up infinite numbers of flowers

1145
00:46:59,296 --> 00:47:01,197
for no reason whatever.

1146
00:47:01,197 --> 00:47:02,798
So if it works for them, it'll work for us, right?

1147
00:47:02,798 --> 00:47:03,718
And ours a narrative too?

1148
00:47:03,718 --> 00:47:06,539
I don't know, somehow I think those people won't enjoy it,

1149
00:47:06,539 --> 00:47:06,839
but whatever.

1150
00:47:06,839 --> 00:47:07,319
And that's our structure.

1151
00:47:07,319 --> 00:47:07,879
That is our game loop.

1152
00:47:17,707 --> 00:47:20,534
I'm really sorry to subject you to that.

1153
00:47:20,534 --> 00:47:21,797
Right.

1154
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:24,384
And that's the architectural structure of Heaven's Vault.

1155
00:47:24,384 --> 00:47:26,649
That's how we're doing what we're doing.

1156
00:47:27,455 --> 00:47:29,015
At this point, we've built one demo level.

1157
00:47:29,015 --> 00:47:31,816
We've been showing it to press this week.

1158
00:47:31,816 --> 00:47:33,297
It works, playing that level 20, 30 times.

1159
00:47:33,297 --> 00:47:35,417
Every single play through, we saw content arise

1160
00:47:35,417 --> 00:47:38,298
that none of us had seen before, mostly minor stuff,

1161
00:47:38,298 --> 00:47:40,899
mostly remarks about something in the environment.

1162
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:45,761
One Italian journalist had a huge argument with his robot

1163
00:47:45,761 --> 00:47:48,042
and generated a long procedural slanging match

1164
00:47:48,042 --> 00:47:48,982
that none of us had seen.

1165
00:47:48,982 --> 00:47:50,603
We wrote it about two and a half years ago,

1166
00:47:50,603 --> 00:47:52,703
but it surfaced because one person

1167
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:55,024
was sufficiently horrible to their robot.

1168
00:47:55,024 --> 00:47:55,845
Don't be that guy.

1169
00:47:58,230 --> 00:48:03,153
Equally, today, we had a journalist who was very nice to their robot and had some little

1170
00:48:03,153 --> 00:48:06,955
cuddly-feely conversations with their robot, which I also hadn't seen, because I'm a middle-of-the-road

1171
00:48:06,955 --> 00:48:07,555
kind of player.

1172
00:48:07,555 --> 00:48:10,737
That doesn't happen in 80 days.

1173
00:48:10,737 --> 00:48:14,540
We joke that there is content in 80 days that no one has ever seen, that we haven't seen,

1174
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:17,962
but it's not really very true, whereas this is somewhat more true.

1175
00:48:17,962 --> 00:48:19,423
It does mean we'll have more typos, though.

1176
00:48:19,423 --> 00:48:24,986
To put that more seriously, it does mean we have a massive problem with stability.

1177
00:48:25,528 --> 00:48:27,109
Stability is now a serious issue.

1178
00:48:27,109 --> 00:48:29,270
We're in the same territory as the Blade Runner game

1179
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:30,191
and the last Express game.

1180
00:48:30,191 --> 00:48:32,252
And both of those games, the big failure was,

1181
00:48:32,252 --> 00:48:33,873
apart from being both commercial flops,

1182
00:48:33,873 --> 00:48:35,834
which scares the living lights out of me,

1183
00:48:35,834 --> 00:48:40,357
was that all of them went really badly wrong

1184
00:48:40,357 --> 00:48:41,558
if left in the hands of a player

1185
00:48:41,558 --> 00:48:43,579
who didn't understand the system.

1186
00:48:43,579 --> 00:48:47,021
Content chains are fragile, inherently.

1187
00:48:48,025 --> 00:48:52,347
You can get dead ends, where the flow just stops and there's nothing left for anyone to do,

1188
00:48:52,347 --> 00:48:55,608
and Chandler's hero is wandering around the dirty streets of LA going,

1189
00:48:55,608 --> 00:49:00,010
everyone seems okay, I don't have a job, I don't know what to do.

1190
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:03,871
You can have more subtle things. The system might offer the player far too many options.

1191
00:49:03,871 --> 00:49:08,253
I might be in a dialogue with 20 things I can say, and I don't want 20 things I can say.

1192
00:49:08,253 --> 00:49:13,435
Okay, maybe we handle that on the UI side, but maybe we have a real problem to solve as well.

1193
00:49:13,435 --> 00:49:14,635
Episodes themselves.

1194
00:49:15,275 --> 00:49:19,058
can get stuck in loops, they can repeat themselves, they can otherwise embarrass themselves,

1195
00:49:19,058 --> 00:49:21,360
they can get you stuck in cupboards, whatever.

1196
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:24,202
All the normal kind of game logic problems are still there,

1197
00:49:24,202 --> 00:49:27,265
but in a nonlinear environment, they're much harder to spot.

1198
00:49:27,265 --> 00:49:30,708
And of course, procedural clues can be total rubbish,

1199
00:49:30,708 --> 00:49:33,390
because procedural generation likes to throw up total rubbish.

1200
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,781
This was one I had just before, while I was writing the talk.

1201
00:49:36,781 --> 00:49:39,342
A chipped antler jug shaped like a rabbit.

1202
00:49:39,342 --> 00:49:41,503
I do know what the rules are that generated this,

1203
00:49:41,503 --> 00:49:43,264
but I have no idea what I was thinking

1204
00:49:43,264 --> 00:49:46,326
when I allowed this thing to be produced.

1205
00:49:46,326 --> 00:49:48,287
I struggle even to picture what this object

1206
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:50,788
is supposed to be, but there we go.

1207
00:49:50,788 --> 00:49:53,210
I think I literally put in a rule that said,

1208
00:49:53,210 --> 00:49:56,131
if it says shaped like a rabbit, don't say that.

1209
00:49:56,131 --> 00:49:58,313
That's not a thing anyone should ever say.

1210
00:49:58,313 --> 00:49:59,994
What even is a rabbit shape?

1211
00:49:59,994 --> 00:50:00,934
I don't know.

1212
00:50:02,502 --> 00:50:03,662
So what do we do?

1213
00:50:03,662 --> 00:50:05,782
Well, we did this.

1214
00:50:05,782 --> 00:50:08,583
We build a spreadsheet version of the game out of an old

1215
00:50:08,583 --> 00:50:09,143
prototype.

1216
00:50:09,143 --> 00:50:13,304
So this is a big thank you to Yannick Losey, who did the

1217
00:50:13,304 --> 00:50:14,944
JavaScript port of the Ink Engine.

1218
00:50:14,944 --> 00:50:18,045
One of the few benefits that we've seen of open-sourcing

1219
00:50:18,045 --> 00:50:21,706
Ink is this chap built a JavaScript version which

1220
00:50:21,706 --> 00:50:23,026
allows me to do this kind of thing.

1221
00:50:23,026 --> 00:50:24,567
Massive kudos to him.

1222
00:50:25,417 --> 00:50:28,179
This plays the game automatically, right?

1223
00:50:28,179 --> 00:50:30,421
It has the actual ink script,

1224
00:50:30,421 --> 00:50:32,943
and almost all of our game logic is in that ink script,

1225
00:50:32,943 --> 00:50:34,605
precisely to make this easier.

1226
00:50:34,605 --> 00:50:37,747
It bashes through it at random, it runs that script,

1227
00:50:37,747 --> 00:50:39,509
and then when it gets back to the game layer,

1228
00:50:39,509 --> 00:50:40,890
the open world layer,

1229
00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:43,452
it simulates it in that crappy orange box there,

1230
00:50:43,452 --> 00:50:45,033
and those little yellow ones

1231
00:50:45,033 --> 00:50:46,355
are ones that you might have a reason to go to.

1232
00:50:46,355 --> 00:50:47,736
The black square one is one

1233
00:50:47,736 --> 00:50:48,937
that you need more evidence to go to,

1234
00:50:48,937 --> 00:50:50,158
and the gray ones are the ones you can't go to,

1235
00:50:50,158 --> 00:50:52,059
but you have been to, sort of thing.

1236
00:50:52,948 --> 00:50:53,669
So we just run it.

1237
00:50:53,669 --> 00:50:55,770
We just say, right, run this for 10 locations

1238
00:50:55,770 --> 00:50:56,711
and show me the game state.

1239
00:50:56,711 --> 00:50:58,513
Run this for 15 game locations.

1240
00:50:58,513 --> 00:50:58,953
Run this for 25.

1241
00:50:58,953 --> 00:51:01,115
Run this to the end of the game.

1242
00:51:01,115 --> 00:51:02,937
Just run it and see where you get to.

1243
00:51:02,937 --> 00:51:04,438
And most of the times you do that,

1244
00:51:04,438 --> 00:51:05,419
it'll crash at some point.

1245
00:51:05,419 --> 00:51:09,022
It'll say, I'm halfway through the Emperor's Library,

1246
00:51:09,022 --> 00:51:10,543
and I went up the stairs and down the stairs

1247
00:51:10,543 --> 00:51:11,584
and up the stairs and down the stairs,

1248
00:51:11,584 --> 00:51:13,066
and then I dropped the key, and then I went up the stairs,

1249
00:51:13,066 --> 00:51:14,087
and now I can't get down the stairs.

1250
00:51:14,087 --> 00:51:15,488
I've run out of content.

1251
00:51:16,479 --> 00:51:17,380
which is fantastic.

1252
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:19,881
That would have taken me 16 hours of play,

1253
00:51:19,881 --> 00:51:22,163
generate, if I had generate, or any beta tester.

1254
00:51:22,163 --> 00:51:24,865
So I fix it, recompile, run the simulation again.

1255
00:51:24,865 --> 00:51:27,487
That's not enough, but if I do that all the time,

1256
00:51:27,487 --> 00:51:29,948
every night for a year, I will capture the majority

1257
00:51:29,948 --> 00:51:33,371
of dead ends, loose ends, and essentially runtime errors.

1258
00:51:33,371 --> 00:51:35,872
What we're doing is we're turning the entire game flow,

1259
00:51:35,872 --> 00:51:38,254
an inherently unstable content chain,

1260
00:51:38,254 --> 00:51:39,955
into one large computer program

1261
00:51:39,955 --> 00:51:41,116
we can just set off on its own.

1262
00:51:42,085 --> 00:51:43,347
So that's really good.

1263
00:51:43,347 --> 00:51:47,154
It also spits out the transcript, which you can just read.

1264
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,961
and that's good for redrafting and I can spot typos.

1265
00:51:50,961 --> 00:51:52,102
I just flick through it and go,

1266
00:51:52,102 --> 00:51:54,043
that's not a very good line of dialogue.

1267
00:51:54,043 --> 00:51:55,324
That's not a very good segue.

1268
00:51:55,324 --> 00:51:57,385
I wonder if there's a joke to follow up that line.

1269
00:51:57,385 --> 00:51:58,046
I can go and check.

1270
00:51:58,046 --> 00:52:01,948
And I can see content chains that I don't otherwise see

1271
00:52:01,948 --> 00:52:03,449
because when we play the game,

1272
00:52:03,449 --> 00:52:05,870
we tend to play it a bit the same way every time

1273
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:08,052
because that's the thing that people do.

1274
00:52:08,052 --> 00:52:10,273
It also spits out all the translations that are generated

1275
00:52:10,273 --> 00:52:12,494
so we can test the translation unlock flow as well

1276
00:52:12,494 --> 00:52:14,435
with the language mechanics.

1277
00:52:16,071 --> 00:52:17,932
So yay, automated testing.

1278
00:52:17,932 --> 00:52:19,493
Everybody's been telling us we should have done this

1279
00:52:19,493 --> 00:52:21,354
for years, but we never got around to it.

1280
00:52:21,354 --> 00:52:22,334
We didn't do it for 80 days.

1281
00:52:22,334 --> 00:52:23,075
I can't think why,

1282
00:52:23,075 --> 00:52:24,736
because it would have solved so many problems,

1283
00:52:24,736 --> 00:52:26,617
but it's actually not that bad.

1284
00:52:26,617 --> 00:52:27,457
It's fine.

1285
00:52:27,457 --> 00:52:29,658
We have this little JavaScript prototype.

1286
00:52:29,658 --> 00:52:30,619
We just run it sometimes.

1287
00:52:30,619 --> 00:52:31,719
It's good for redrafting.

1288
00:52:31,719 --> 00:52:33,320
It's good for checking continuity.

1289
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:36,902
It's allowed us to push the complexity of the logic we use,

1290
00:52:36,902 --> 00:52:38,683
because I'm more confident that we can test it.

1291
00:52:38,683 --> 00:52:41,104
I'm less terrified that I've done something

1292
00:52:41,104 --> 00:52:42,545
really trivially stupid.

1293
00:52:43,545 --> 00:52:44,306
which is great.

1294
00:52:44,306 --> 00:52:46,546
I can have my robot go off on its own and come back a lot,

1295
00:52:46,546 --> 00:52:49,547
which is the sort of thing that often has edge cases.

1296
00:52:49,547 --> 00:52:51,527
Well, this is great at finding them.

1297
00:52:51,527 --> 00:52:54,768
And it lets us do our game-wide balancing.

1298
00:52:54,768 --> 00:52:56,709
Remember I said that the procedural system

1299
00:52:56,709 --> 00:52:59,009
gave you a single unlock curve?

1300
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:01,510
Well, this is where I wrote the unlock curve

1301
00:53:01,510 --> 00:53:03,670
in JavaScript running an automated process.

1302
00:53:03,670 --> 00:53:04,970
You tweak it, you tweak it, you tweak it,

1303
00:53:04,970 --> 00:53:05,871
you port it into Unity.

1304
00:53:05,871 --> 00:53:08,471
I've never seen that unlock curve work in Unity

1305
00:53:08,471 --> 00:53:10,972
because we haven't built enough of the game yet,

1306
00:53:10,972 --> 00:53:12,552
but I'm 96% confident it will work.

1307
00:53:13,092 --> 00:53:14,133
because I've already run it.

1308
00:53:14,133 --> 00:53:14,874
That's brilliant.

1309
00:53:14,874 --> 00:53:16,495
That's great.

1310
00:53:16,495 --> 00:53:18,076
Finally, yeah, it catches ink flow bugs.

1311
00:53:18,076 --> 00:53:20,798
And it also helped us improve the ink engine itself

1312
00:53:20,798 --> 00:53:22,979
by capturing some really deep down rare engine

1313
00:53:22,979 --> 00:53:23,980
bugs which were there.

1314
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:25,161
They're not there anymore.

1315
00:53:25,161 --> 00:53:25,581
Problems?

1316
00:53:28,593 --> 00:53:29,454
I'm coming towards the end.

1317
00:53:29,454 --> 00:53:30,955
Thank you very much for listening.

1318
00:53:30,955 --> 00:53:34,418
It's a bit of a, ah, problems.

1319
00:53:34,418 --> 00:53:37,280
It doesn't understand anything, obviously.

1320
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,862
It has no idea if you've repeatedly called the robot

1321
00:53:39,862 --> 00:53:40,682
by the wrong name.

1322
00:53:40,682 --> 00:53:42,704
It doesn't know if you've walked up and downstairs.

1323
00:53:42,704 --> 00:53:44,525
It doesn't know anything, really.

1324
00:53:44,525 --> 00:53:47,607
You have to read the content to see if it makes any sense.

1325
00:53:47,607 --> 00:53:49,729
It doesn't test anything in the 3D world,

1326
00:53:49,729 --> 00:53:51,910
and there are lots of bugs in 3D worlds.

1327
00:53:51,910 --> 00:53:54,212
Our props disappear behind collision,

1328
00:53:54,212 --> 00:53:55,993
cameras go through bushes, all the usual stuff.

1329
00:53:56,417 --> 00:53:57,978
We are going to have to play this game a lot

1330
00:53:57,978 --> 00:53:59,159
to check all of that,

1331
00:53:59,159 --> 00:54:01,720
but it does at least mean that we are checking that,

1332
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:04,542
not having to check the story content at the same time.

1333
00:54:04,542 --> 00:54:06,883
It is yet more code to maintain,

1334
00:54:06,883 --> 00:54:08,184
yet more bugs to be introduced,

1335
00:54:08,184 --> 00:54:11,626
yet more disparities between the two layers of the game,

1336
00:54:11,626 --> 00:54:13,627
the JavaScript and the Unity version.

1337
00:54:13,627 --> 00:54:16,369
That's unfortunate.

1338
00:54:16,369 --> 00:54:19,470
And finally, and most importantly,

1339
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:22,692
randomized play is just the worst simulation

1340
00:54:22,692 --> 00:54:24,593
of human behavior I've ever seen.

1341
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:27,360
We are better than this.

1342
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:28,781
We are better than this.

1343
00:54:28,781 --> 00:54:32,282
A random player will go upstairs, downstairs,

1344
00:54:32,282 --> 00:54:33,942
upstairs, downstairs, upstairs, downstairs.

1345
00:54:33,942 --> 00:54:35,562
Okay, I've seen everything and leave.

1346
00:54:35,562 --> 00:54:38,883
And over here is a big shiny object

1347
00:54:38,883 --> 00:54:40,624
with some really interesting plot attached

1348
00:54:40,624 --> 00:54:42,364
and it goes, no, I won't see it.

1349
00:54:42,364 --> 00:54:43,465
And I know as game designers,

1350
00:54:43,465 --> 00:54:45,565
we always give players too much credit

1351
00:54:45,565 --> 00:54:47,326
because actually players walk into an environment,

1352
00:54:47,326 --> 00:54:49,606
completely miss that, completely ignore this,

1353
00:54:49,606 --> 00:54:50,827
focus on one spot on the ground

1354
00:54:50,827 --> 00:54:51,987
and then say, I don't know what to do.

1355
00:54:53,414 --> 00:54:53,834
I know.

1356
00:54:53,834 --> 00:54:58,603
And at least randomised players helps us to break the assumption that people are playing

1357
00:54:58,603 --> 00:55:04,373
your game with any modicum of attention, because they probably aren't, or at least not always,

1358
00:55:04,373 --> 00:55:05,275
even when they mean well.

1359
00:55:06,168 --> 00:55:08,949
But we have had to introduce additional code

1360
00:55:08,949 --> 00:55:11,709
to try and get the random simulation to hit

1361
00:55:11,709 --> 00:55:14,170
any interesting side story content.

1362
00:55:14,170 --> 00:55:17,111
So if there's a particular bit of the narrative,

1363
00:55:17,111 --> 00:55:18,911
which is cool, but it does require you to go

1364
00:55:18,911 --> 00:55:20,912
and talk to this person about this thing,

1365
00:55:20,912 --> 00:55:23,352
we basically have code that says, just do that.

1366
00:55:23,352 --> 00:55:24,413
Just get on and do that.

1367
00:55:24,413 --> 00:55:25,753
Are you near it? Do it.

1368
00:55:25,753 --> 00:55:27,213
No, you're not allowed to leave.

1369
00:55:27,213 --> 00:55:28,114
Do your homework.

1370
00:55:28,114 --> 00:55:29,654
And we need that.

1371
00:55:29,654 --> 00:55:30,874
And that's more code to maintain

1372
00:55:30,874 --> 00:55:32,095
and it's debug specific code,

1373
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:33,755
so we're not really testing properly.

1374
00:55:33,755 --> 00:55:34,075
I think,

1375
00:55:34,838 --> 00:55:39,060
As we get closer to release, I'm going to let this thing run randomly more often,

1376
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:40,681
because stability matters.

1377
00:55:40,681 --> 00:55:45,362
But for the moment, we have to kind of hamstring it

1378
00:55:45,362 --> 00:55:47,683
to get it to do the things that we're actually interested in,

1379
00:55:47,683 --> 00:55:48,363
which is a shame.

1380
00:55:48,363 --> 00:55:49,804
I wish there was a smarter way of doing that.

1381
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:50,084
And that's it.

1382
00:55:55,265 --> 00:55:56,685
That's what we're doing.

1383
00:55:56,685 --> 00:55:59,807
In conclusion, we have a free-form,

1384
00:55:59,807 --> 00:56:03,629
contextually aware interaction across a 3D environment

1385
00:56:03,629 --> 00:56:06,670
entirely made out of authored and specific content

1386
00:56:06,670 --> 00:56:09,312
via easily editable blocks with simply logic,

1387
00:56:09,312 --> 00:56:11,693
with simple logic, with simple additive logic.

1388
00:56:11,693 --> 00:56:14,955
Though the story frame rate is now an issue.

1389
00:56:16,931 --> 00:56:18,492
In general, efficient authoring patterns

1390
00:56:18,492 --> 00:56:20,234
have been utterly critical to us.

1391
00:56:20,234 --> 00:56:22,776
We couldn't do it if we hadn't developed those.

1392
00:56:22,776 --> 00:56:25,498
We still use scale and redundancy

1393
00:56:25,498 --> 00:56:26,539
in the text and dialogue.

1394
00:56:26,539 --> 00:56:29,221
We haven't actually thrown away that crutch at all.

1395
00:56:29,221 --> 00:56:31,042
Automated testing is good.

1396
00:56:31,042 --> 00:56:33,344
Any amount of it appears to be good.

1397
00:56:33,344 --> 00:56:35,726
And our major limiting factor is art cost

1398
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:36,607
and 3D world markup.

1399
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:38,608
It's not actually story complexity.

1400
00:56:38,608 --> 00:56:40,730
Our story is doing some nice crazy things

1401
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:42,331
because I think I can get away with it

1402
00:56:42,331 --> 00:56:44,113
while the art department build another chair.

1403
00:56:45,703 --> 00:56:53,586
So, that's me, and if you'll forgive me, I wanted to finish with one last thought.

1404
00:56:53,586 --> 00:56:58,168
So over the last four years I've done three talks at GDC about interactive narrative and

1405
00:56:58,168 --> 00:57:01,469
the work that we've done at Inkle, which I hope a lot of you have interacted with and

1406
00:57:01,469 --> 00:57:05,831
I hope a lot of you have found at least interesting and perhaps provocative.

1407
00:57:06,838 --> 00:57:09,901
And I think I mentioned earlier that we had a philosophy in the games we make,

1408
00:57:09,901 --> 00:57:11,543
but I think we have something deeper than that.

1409
00:57:11,543 --> 00:57:15,647
I think we have a core principle, which is the thing that makes us do what we're

1410
00:57:15,647 --> 00:57:19,210
doing in the first place, the thing that we strive for and that we want to see in

1411
00:57:19,210 --> 00:57:22,754
narrative games. And I, I saw a good formulation of it. So I thought,

1412
00:57:22,754 --> 00:57:26,177
I thought I'd, I thought I'd share that with you in the last minute of the talk,

1413
00:57:26,177 --> 00:57:27,539
which is this, um,

1414
00:57:29,512 --> 00:57:31,653
The conservation of narrative momentum.

1415
00:57:31,653 --> 00:57:33,514
Obviously that's a massive bastardization

1416
00:57:33,514 --> 00:57:35,155
of what the conservation of momentum is,

1417
00:57:35,155 --> 00:57:36,596
but I've got a math degree, so I don't care.

1418
00:57:36,596 --> 00:57:42,500
And what I think I want to say is that games

1419
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:45,162
should be striving to conserve narrative momentum

1420
00:57:45,162 --> 00:57:46,083
at all times.

1421
00:57:46,083 --> 00:57:49,325
Every narrative experience, a novel, a film, or whatever,

1422
00:57:49,325 --> 00:57:52,067
has got to feel always like something is happening

1423
00:57:52,067 --> 00:57:55,529
right now, but also something is about to happen just now.

1424
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,661
And both of those things have to be true simultaneously.

1425
00:57:58,661 --> 00:58:01,543
Every writer has to balance resolution and mystery,

1426
00:58:01,543 --> 00:58:05,786
tension and payoff, threat and release all of the time.

1427
00:58:05,786 --> 00:58:07,327
Good narrative games need to do this,

1428
00:58:07,327 --> 00:58:09,209
but it's really hard because the player

1429
00:58:09,209 --> 00:58:10,630
keeps walking into things,

1430
00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:12,431
or repeating the same conversation with an NPC,

1431
00:58:12,431 --> 00:58:16,854
or getting lost, or going in and out of the same door.

1432
00:58:16,854 --> 00:58:20,177
Players are our worst enemy

1433
00:58:20,177 --> 00:58:21,798
when it comes to narrative momentum,

1434
00:58:21,798 --> 00:58:22,899
because they don't even know what it is

1435
00:58:22,899 --> 00:58:24,340
they're supposed to be doing.

1436
00:58:25,735 --> 00:58:28,237
So to conserve narrative momentum as best we can,

1437
00:58:28,237 --> 00:58:30,318
everything that the player does that's awkward,

1438
00:58:30,318 --> 00:58:32,140
we need to gloss over as fast as possible

1439
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:32,981
and get out of the way.

1440
00:58:32,981 --> 00:58:34,061
I used to write text dimensions,

1441
00:58:34,061 --> 00:58:35,583
parser-based interactive fiction,

1442
00:58:35,583 --> 00:58:37,384
and the single worst thing about those

1443
00:58:37,384 --> 00:58:38,425
is that when you make a typo,

1444
00:58:38,425 --> 00:58:39,906
it says, oh, I don't know that word,

1445
00:58:39,906 --> 00:58:41,888
and then it leaves that on screen.

1446
00:58:41,888 --> 00:58:44,330
It leaves your error in front of you,

1447
00:58:44,330 --> 00:58:45,290
and then if you get two in a row,

1448
00:58:45,290 --> 00:58:46,231
it leaves two errors,

1449
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:48,313
and if you get three commands wrong in a row,

1450
00:58:48,313 --> 00:58:50,594
you can't see any story anymore,

1451
00:58:50,594 --> 00:58:53,537
apart from all the things you did wrong.

1452
00:58:53,537 --> 00:58:54,057
It's terrible.

1453
00:58:54,938 --> 00:58:56,239
The loss of momentum is appalling.

1454
00:58:56,239 --> 00:58:58,440
Well, okay, these were games designed to be played

1455
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:59,441
coming out of a printer.

1456
00:58:59,441 --> 00:59:01,942
It's not their fault, but we definitely can do better.

1457
00:59:01,942 --> 00:59:05,844
But a lot of games, those errors are all I see.

1458
00:59:05,844 --> 00:59:07,545
When I'm running around a level and I'm uncharted

1459
00:59:07,545 --> 00:59:08,706
and I've completely got lost

1460
00:59:08,706 --> 00:59:10,107
and I'm being shot from all directions

1461
00:59:10,107 --> 00:59:11,488
and the guys do not stop.

1462
00:59:11,488 --> 00:59:13,529
They come right at me and I have nothing

1463
00:59:13,529 --> 00:59:14,950
but error compounded upon error.

1464
00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:17,612
When I'm trying to play Assassin's Creed in stealth mode

1465
00:59:17,612 --> 00:59:18,952
and the frame rate starts to drop

1466
00:59:18,952 --> 00:59:21,314
because every single NPC in the entire level

1467
00:59:21,314 --> 00:59:22,294
has zoned in on me.

1468
00:59:24,170 --> 00:59:27,791
I'm in a narrative point which is not interesting.

1469
00:59:27,791 --> 00:59:31,133
It's just making me feel like I bottled it.

1470
00:59:31,133 --> 00:59:33,054
The narrative momentum evaporates.

1471
00:59:33,054 --> 00:59:34,034
Okay, maybe the gameplay's fun.

1472
00:59:34,034 --> 00:59:34,294
That's fine.

1473
00:59:34,294 --> 00:59:37,215
But I care about the narrative momentum.

1474
00:59:39,621 --> 00:59:45,762
The player should always be thinking about what they're going to do, not what they're supposed to do.

1475
00:59:45,762 --> 00:59:48,303
Time should always be moving forward.

1476
00:59:48,303 --> 00:59:51,764
Moving forward through the story should be frictionless, which doesn't mean you can't have puzzles,

1477
00:59:51,764 --> 00:59:55,905
but it does mean that attempting to solve a puzzle has got to be part of that narrative.

1478
00:59:55,905 --> 01:00:00,986
For example, if I find a stuck door and I rattle it and it's stuck, that's fine.

1479
01:00:00,986 --> 01:00:04,086
But if I rattle it again, she should say, it's still stuck.

1480
01:00:05,136 --> 01:00:09,199
That's a minor thing, but it changes the totality

1481
01:00:09,199 --> 01:00:11,301
of the framing of that moment in the story.

1482
01:00:11,301 --> 01:00:14,423
It becomes an expression of the protagonist's frustration.

1483
01:00:14,423 --> 01:00:15,985
That's meaningful.

1484
01:00:15,985 --> 01:00:19,147
Not just the computer repeating its cycle.

1485
01:00:19,147 --> 01:00:20,748
Games should not waste our time.

1486
01:00:20,748 --> 01:00:23,010
They should surprise us, delight us,

1487
01:00:23,010 --> 01:00:24,231
and then they should finish

1488
01:00:24,231 --> 01:00:26,333
while we are still leaning forwards.

1489
01:00:26,333 --> 01:00:26,933
Thank you for listening.

1490
01:00:36,614 --> 01:00:40,975
I might have time for like one question, but I'll hang around afterwards.

1491
01:00:40,975 --> 01:00:43,256
Does anyone dare the microphone?

1492
01:00:43,256 --> 01:00:43,696
Yes, no, yes, no.

1493
01:00:43,696 --> 01:00:44,356
Yeah. Hi.

1494
01:00:44,356 --> 01:00:55,378
So you're saying that your Heaven's Vault is it's got procedural content in it,

1495
01:00:55,378 --> 01:01:00,560
which I am really interested in because I enjoy roguelike games.

1496
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:06,001
So I was wondering where you draw the line between like.

1497
01:01:06,767 --> 01:01:11,658
procedural content and the narrative that you're trying to show the user.

1498
01:01:11,658 --> 01:01:13,363
So I think the key thing to realize is that.

1499
01:01:14,029 --> 01:01:17,751
The question is about how we draw the line between narrative and procedural content.

1500
01:01:17,751 --> 01:01:21,433
The key thing to remember is that almost all of the content in Heaven's Vault is authored.

1501
01:01:21,433 --> 01:01:27,576
The solution that I like to use is a procedural structure filled with narrative possibilities.

1502
01:01:27,576 --> 01:01:30,678
So in a roguelike, you might see the same monster 20 times.

1503
01:01:30,678 --> 01:01:34,560
Well, we just write 20 different monsters, that essentially.

1504
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:38,802
So I think the kind of dynamic structuring that roguelike games do is really, really interesting.

1505
01:01:39,509 --> 01:01:45,735
what I like to try and find ways to do is to ensure that the way that content is surfaced

1506
01:01:45,735 --> 01:01:48,297
gets filtered into something that an author has control over.

1507
01:01:48,297 --> 01:01:52,701
And that goes right back to like the way we structure the game, you know, we use text,

1508
01:01:52,701 --> 01:01:55,444
we don't use voiceover because that allows us to do that, that kind of thing.

1509
01:01:55,444 --> 01:01:58,547
But obviously it depends on the game and depends on the intention of the game.

1510
01:01:58,547 --> 01:02:02,390
And particularly with roguelike, you don't, they are built around re-building.

1511
01:02:02,913 --> 01:02:06,595
from replayability around the loop and yeah,

1512
01:02:06,595 --> 01:02:08,796
authored content in a loop is pretty awful.

1513
01:02:08,796 --> 01:02:11,357
So you have to solve that problem.

1514
01:02:11,357 --> 01:02:12,298
I think we did in 80 days.

1515
01:02:12,298 --> 01:02:13,979
I like to call 80 days a roguelike,

1516
01:02:13,979 --> 01:02:16,540
but slightly just for a laugh.

1517
01:02:16,540 --> 01:02:16,720
Yeah.

1518
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:21,462
Could you be more specific about what you meant

1519
01:02:21,462 --> 01:02:22,783
when you said unlock curve?

1520
01:02:23,483 --> 01:02:38,678
The unlock curve? Yeah. Yeah, so if you... yeah, absolutely. So early prototype, you played a couple of levels, you picked up some artifacts from here and there, the artifacts allow you to find locations, I ran the game for seven levels, and suddenly I had ten planets I could visit.

1521
01:02:38,678 --> 01:02:46,626
And I don't want the player to be looking at ten planets and going, which one do I want to go to? Because the player doesn't actually care that much. I want the player to be looking at three, always.

1522
01:02:47,307 --> 01:02:50,269
And I want to make sure that the game is rigged so that they never have more than three.

1523
01:02:50,269 --> 01:02:52,230
And that's what I mean by the unlock curve.

1524
01:02:52,230 --> 01:02:55,132
So the game should do that at the beginning, it should do that for a while,

1525
01:02:55,132 --> 01:02:57,493
and then towards the end of the game, it should start to do that.

1526
01:02:57,493 --> 01:03:00,855
So the player gets the sense that they're funneling towards one grand prize.

1527
01:03:00,855 --> 01:03:02,936
So it's that, it's controlling.

1528
01:03:03,755 --> 01:03:05,557
It's controlling how fast things are unlocked,

1529
01:03:05,557 --> 01:03:08,720
but really actually what I actually care about

1530
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,201
is controlling how many alternatives

1531
01:03:10,201 --> 01:03:12,343
the player has to look at at any given time.

1532
01:03:12,343 --> 01:03:14,045
So essentially, you know in The Witcher

1533
01:03:14,045 --> 01:03:16,467
when you've got like 20 possible side quests?

1534
01:03:16,467 --> 01:03:18,690
That's rubbish, don't do that.

1535
01:03:18,690 --> 01:03:19,190
Thanks.

1536
01:03:19,190 --> 01:03:19,731
All right, I think I'm done.

1537
01:03:19,731 --> 01:03:20,472
Thank you very much, everyone.
