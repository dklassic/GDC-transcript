1
00:00:04,565 --> 00:00:08,348
and gentlemen, and I welcome you to my GDC 2017 talk

2
00:00:08,348 --> 00:00:10,690
about next level creature sound design.

3
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:12,892
And before I actually start, may I remind you

4
00:00:12,892 --> 00:00:14,654
to just switch off your phones and maybe put them

5
00:00:14,654 --> 00:00:18,197
into quiet mode or flight mode.

6
00:00:18,197 --> 00:00:20,078
And I think we are ready to go.

7
00:00:21,371 --> 00:00:23,313
So first of all, I want to give you an overview

8
00:00:23,313 --> 00:00:24,553
about what I'm going to talk today.

9
00:00:24,553 --> 00:00:27,556
So obviously it's about next level creature sound design.

10
00:00:27,556 --> 00:00:29,317
And first of all, I'm going to give you an introduction

11
00:00:29,317 --> 00:00:32,239
about myself, why am I kind of the right person

12
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:34,281
to talk about creature sound design in the first place.

13
00:00:34,281 --> 00:00:36,483
I will give you some initial thoughts

14
00:00:36,483 --> 00:00:37,884
about creature sound design,

15
00:00:37,884 --> 00:00:40,906
because I've been doing this for about the last seven years.

16
00:00:40,906 --> 00:00:44,929
I will also run you through pre-production,

17
00:00:44,929 --> 00:00:47,471
the recording process, the design process,

18
00:00:47,471 --> 00:00:50,513
and also briefly about implementation.

19
00:00:51,574 --> 00:00:55,337
And yeah, so myself, my name's David Phillip,

20
00:00:55,337 --> 00:00:57,359
and I'm a co-founder of Noiseworks Limited,

21
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:00,981
an audio outsourcing company in London.

22
00:01:00,981 --> 00:01:03,984
And I'm also a Boom Library recordist and designer.

23
00:01:03,984 --> 00:01:07,266
And I worked on a large amount of creature-heavy titles

24
00:01:07,266 --> 00:01:09,268
in my past, so for example, Elder Scrolls Online,

25
00:01:09,268 --> 00:01:10,869
most of you probably know.

26
00:01:10,869 --> 00:01:12,470
Blade and Soul, which is an Asian game,

27
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,131
and Arcania is a German game,

28
00:01:14,131 --> 00:01:15,772
again, a very creature-heavy title.

29
00:01:16,732 --> 00:01:19,573
And over the last four years, or the last two years actually,

30
00:01:19,573 --> 00:01:22,876
I was leading the Creature Sound Effects production

31
00:01:22,876 --> 00:01:25,817
for Total War Warhammer, which I think many of you have played.

32
00:01:25,817 --> 00:01:28,279
And it's, again, a very creature-heavy title.

33
00:01:28,279 --> 00:01:31,341
And I'm very happy to share some insight out of that game

34
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,703
and out of the production with you tonight as well.

35
00:01:33,703 --> 00:01:36,865
Right, so the initial thoughts, I

36
00:01:36,865 --> 00:01:40,687
think that's quite important to ask yourself before you start

37
00:01:40,687 --> 00:01:41,688
designing creature sounds.

38
00:01:41,688 --> 00:01:44,229
So I think the first question I ask myself

39
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,371
is, what's my role as a creature sound designer?

40
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,661
And I think the best way to put it is to create sound for something alive,

41
00:01:50,661 --> 00:01:54,622
where there's not really a reference in the real world,

42
00:01:54,622 --> 00:01:57,463
so you can't just go out and have a look at what a creature sounds like.

43
00:01:57,463 --> 00:01:59,544
That's pretty much impossible.

44
00:01:59,544 --> 00:02:04,666
And that's a very creative process of making that make sense to the audience or the player.

45
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:09,708
The second question is, what makes a creature more difficult than other sound effects?

46
00:02:10,852 --> 00:02:19,820
It's again a very difficult question in a way, but again, you know, there's no real life reference and that's definitely a tough aspect about the whole thing.

47
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:30,690
But we're also highly dependent on different layers, which, you know, they can be difficult to blend and, you know, we always have to aim for making a creature sound like one creature, not many at the same time.

48
00:02:31,714 --> 00:02:36,257
And lastly, is there a difference between producing creatures for interactive and linear media?

49
00:02:36,257 --> 00:02:40,060
I mean, obviously we're at GDC, so it's all about gaming, but

50
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:43,603
some of you might actually have to create creature sounds for FMVs or cutscenes and so on.

51
00:02:43,603 --> 00:02:50,849
And I think the actual production, what we are going to focus on tonight, is actually not that different.

52
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:54,132
But we're going through that over the course of the next hour anyway.

53
00:02:55,437 --> 00:02:59,422
So after these initial thoughts over the last few years,

54
00:02:59,422 --> 00:03:01,925
I came up with, personally for me,

55
00:03:01,925 --> 00:03:04,688
the three ingredients of great creature sound design,

56
00:03:04,688 --> 00:03:07,091
like almost like a rule book for myself

57
00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:10,115
to create the creature sound designs from.

58
00:03:10,115 --> 00:03:12,899
So the first point, which always is very important for me,

59
00:03:12,899 --> 00:03:13,600
is character.

60
00:03:14,617 --> 00:03:16,298
So you probably ask yourself, what do you mean by character?

61
00:03:16,298 --> 00:03:17,699
Because people come up to me, you know,

62
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:18,840
they give me feedback on a creature

63
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,461
and say they need much more character,

64
00:03:20,461 --> 00:03:21,441
they don't have enough character.

65
00:03:21,441 --> 00:03:23,362
And I, you know, initially I didn't really know

66
00:03:23,362 --> 00:03:24,863
what they meant.

67
00:03:24,863 --> 00:03:28,405
So character is about how does the creature act?

68
00:03:28,405 --> 00:03:30,046
What's its characteristics, you know?

69
00:03:30,046 --> 00:03:30,687
Is it aggressive?

70
00:03:30,687 --> 00:03:31,647
Is it really stupid?

71
00:03:31,647 --> 00:03:34,629
Is it highly intelligent?

72
00:03:34,629 --> 00:03:36,650
And how do I perceive its emotions?

73
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,611
Or how does it react?

74
00:03:37,611 --> 00:03:40,793
How does it make me feel as a player?

75
00:03:40,793 --> 00:03:44,035
And that's everything on a vocal basis, obviously.

76
00:03:45,205 --> 00:03:48,026
Then the next point, the next very important ingredient

77
00:03:48,026 --> 00:03:48,806
is variation.

78
00:03:48,806 --> 00:03:52,447
So firstly, variation in terms of your articulations.

79
00:03:52,447 --> 00:03:55,248
So for example, attack sounds, death sounds,

80
00:03:55,248 --> 00:03:57,569
pain sounds, idle sounds, all that.

81
00:03:57,569 --> 00:04:01,390
But I think also variation in form of sounds we use.

82
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,270
So again, during the course of the next hour,

83
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,711
we're going to look at different recording techniques

84
00:04:05,711 --> 00:04:08,692
to keep that variation always, you know,

85
00:04:08,692 --> 00:04:09,612
to keep on top of that.

86
00:04:11,135 --> 00:04:14,256
And then the last ingredient is perspective.

87
00:04:14,256 --> 00:04:16,438
So, you know, quite a simple point really,

88
00:04:16,438 --> 00:04:18,239
but it is really important to ask yourself,

89
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:20,400
where does the sound live in our game?

90
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,461
And in what space, you know, is it always indoors?

91
00:04:23,461 --> 00:04:24,362
Is it outdoors?

92
00:04:24,362 --> 00:04:25,402
Is it in a cave?

93
00:04:25,402 --> 00:04:26,243
And so on.

94
00:04:26,243 --> 00:04:28,104
Is it really close up or very far?

95
00:04:28,104 --> 00:04:29,305
So do we have to, you know,

96
00:04:29,305 --> 00:04:30,165
we have to take care of that as well.

97
00:04:30,165 --> 00:04:33,007
And that all comes together in a term

98
00:04:33,007 --> 00:04:33,967
which I think is very...

99
00:04:35,168 --> 00:04:39,431
very important and I will use it, and I apologize in advance, I will use it a lot tonight, which is

100
00:04:39,431 --> 00:04:43,774
believability. So that's our main aim as a creature sound designer, to make something

101
00:04:43,774 --> 00:04:47,476
which I just mentioned before, which isn't real and which isn't in the real world, to make it

102
00:04:47,476 --> 00:04:51,919
believable for the player and, you know, that results in immersion as well for the player.

103
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:57,783
So in the next video I'm going to show you a few examples of creature sounds which for me

104
00:04:57,783 --> 00:05:02,306
stand for believability, they just work and they should get you pumped up for the next hour as

105
00:05:02,306 --> 00:05:03,887
well. So let's have a listen to that.

106
00:06:16,912 --> 00:06:19,833
So yeah, I don't know about you, but even the Godzilla roar

107
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,194
still gives me goosebumps actually,

108
00:06:21,194 --> 00:06:22,195
just now it happened again.

109
00:06:22,195 --> 00:06:24,876
So this is just a really good example

110
00:06:24,876 --> 00:06:25,917
of believable creatures, you know,

111
00:06:25,917 --> 00:06:26,918
that you can just feel the size,

112
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:29,579
you feel the aggression or the intelligence or whatever.

113
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:31,260
A lot of character and a lot of believability.

114
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:35,883
Right, so we can actually start on the actual process,

115
00:06:35,883 --> 00:06:37,944
which we start with the pre-production.

116
00:06:37,944 --> 00:06:40,626
And pre-production is actually

117
00:06:40,626 --> 00:06:42,187
one of the most important aspects,

118
00:06:42,187 --> 00:06:43,708
in my opinion, of creature sound design.

119
00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:48,291
And I'm guilty myself of neglecting that process,

120
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:50,413
and because we always, as sound designers,

121
00:06:50,413 --> 00:06:52,194
we kind of want to jump straight in there

122
00:06:52,194 --> 00:06:53,435
and actually record a design.

123
00:06:53,435 --> 00:06:56,017
So it is mostly overlooked and forgotten about,

124
00:06:56,017 --> 00:06:58,800
but I do think it's very important,

125
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,443
because we always have to be aware of what we work on.

126
00:07:02,443 --> 00:07:04,064
I talked about character before,

127
00:07:04,064 --> 00:07:05,765
so that's one part, obviously,

128
00:07:05,765 --> 00:07:07,987
but also what universe is it in,

129
00:07:07,987 --> 00:07:10,749
and the characteristics and skills of the creatures

130
00:07:10,749 --> 00:07:11,510
we're going to work on.

131
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:15,432
We also need to make ourselves aware of what material we want to use.

132
00:07:15,432 --> 00:07:19,714
So creature sound designs, it stands and falls with the source we are using.

133
00:07:19,714 --> 00:07:21,335
So we want to plan that as well.

134
00:07:21,335 --> 00:07:24,637
One can't paint without colors, it's just, you know, we can't create great sounds without

135
00:07:24,637 --> 00:07:26,979
great material in the first place.

136
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:30,761
And also I think at this point it's very important to mention that if you're freelance or with

137
00:07:30,761 --> 00:07:32,081
a developer, it doesn't really matter.

138
00:07:32,081 --> 00:07:33,442
Pre-production is always important.

139
00:07:33,442 --> 00:07:37,865
Just that it probably is a bit easier to get the information you need when you're actually

140
00:07:37,865 --> 00:07:39,746
employed by someone or in-house.

141
00:07:41,168 --> 00:07:44,873
Let's look at the pre-production a bit of an advanced way

142
00:07:44,873 --> 00:07:46,155
in terms of creature sound design.

143
00:07:46,155 --> 00:07:48,518
So the first thing I would do is I would find out

144
00:07:48,518 --> 00:07:50,620
the creature's origin, its special characteristics

145
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,341
and skills.

146
00:07:51,341 --> 00:07:54,325
So I mentioned before, for example,

147
00:07:54,325 --> 00:07:56,588
a creature can be highly intelligent,

148
00:07:56,588 --> 00:08:00,673
it could be super stupid, it could be, you know,

149
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:03,630
Again, it could be very big, it could be very small,

150
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:04,970
and it could have special skills,

151
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:06,691
like for example, a dragon could have a fire breath.

152
00:08:06,691 --> 00:08:08,452
I need to know about that.

153
00:08:08,452 --> 00:08:11,473
And I need to search, look for the dialogue

154
00:08:11,473 --> 00:08:13,655
between myself and the design team

155
00:08:13,655 --> 00:08:15,876
to find out about the special characteristics

156
00:08:15,876 --> 00:08:17,316
of a creature in the first place.

157
00:08:18,158 --> 00:08:20,519
Then I want to know how does it produce sound in the first place.

158
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:22,720
Does it have a voice box?

159
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,661
Because I've dealt with creatures before who were actually ghostly and before actually

160
00:08:26,661 --> 00:08:29,822
reading about this creature I wouldn't know how they would actually produce the sound.

161
00:08:29,822 --> 00:08:32,883
And that's again something which dictates the way I'm working.

162
00:08:32,883 --> 00:08:35,223
Is there a need for language?

163
00:08:35,843 --> 00:08:40,965
that's a very uh tricky situation actually to be in and it happened to us in in Warhammer

164
00:08:40,965 --> 00:08:45,627
because we are creatures who communicated with one another and that's you know I can't really

165
00:08:45,627 --> 00:08:50,529
deal with that and with my attack sounds and my death sounds so that normally is very important

166
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:54,570
to know and would in our case would go to the dialogue team and they would deal with that

167
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:58,712
but again if you you know if you get to that information very late on in the process

168
00:08:58,712 --> 00:08:59,772
you probably run out of time.

169
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,481
Size and their scale in relation to other creatures in game.

170
00:09:03,481 --> 00:09:04,701
So this is also a very important one.

171
00:09:04,701 --> 00:09:06,022
As you've seen before in the video,

172
00:09:06,022 --> 00:09:08,123
you saw Khaleesi's dragon on her shoulder,

173
00:09:08,123 --> 00:09:12,625
very small compared to Godzilla, which is obviously massive.

174
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,165
But if you just see a screenshot of the game,

175
00:09:14,165 --> 00:09:16,086
you know, you see the dragon and you see Godzilla,

176
00:09:16,086 --> 00:09:18,127
you probably wouldn't be able to tell the difference

177
00:09:18,127 --> 00:09:20,148
between them in size.

178
00:09:20,148 --> 00:09:22,309
And again, it's very important to check beforehand

179
00:09:22,309 --> 00:09:24,990
because it's very difficult after you've created

180
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,470
a full set of creature sounds

181
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,092
to make the sounds very small or very big afterwards.

182
00:09:29,954 --> 00:09:31,836
And all this will come together

183
00:09:31,836 --> 00:09:33,377
and define the sonic character of your creatures.

184
00:09:33,377 --> 00:09:35,079
And again, think about the three main ingredients,

185
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:38,542
characters, definitely one of the most important ones.

186
00:09:38,542 --> 00:09:40,584
So if you, I hope you can see that.

187
00:09:40,584 --> 00:09:42,966
I put like a few example notes together

188
00:09:42,966 --> 00:09:45,829
of how I normally approach creature sound.

189
00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:47,690
In this case, I called it random dragon.

190
00:09:48,371 --> 00:09:50,713
You can see that on the top left there.

191
00:09:50,713 --> 00:09:51,854
And for example, I put down,

192
00:09:51,854 --> 00:09:53,715
I always do a little bit of a mind map.

193
00:09:53,715 --> 00:09:55,496
So first of all, it's just for me,

194
00:09:55,496 --> 00:09:58,619
but later on it's really useful to share this information

195
00:09:58,619 --> 00:10:02,201
with my coworkers who might have to work on their creature

196
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:02,842
if it's not myself.

197
00:10:02,842 --> 00:10:05,744
So in terms of the large dragon here,

198
00:10:05,744 --> 00:10:07,505
the random dragon, sorry, it's a large size.

199
00:10:07,505 --> 00:10:09,687
It's very aggressive, it's highly intelligent,

200
00:10:09,687 --> 00:10:12,209
it's got a few skills like a fire breath,

201
00:10:12,209 --> 00:10:13,250
a tail swing, and then...

202
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:17,877
Here's probably a good one, it's a mega scream which buffs my friendly units,

203
00:10:17,877 --> 00:10:22,183
so I would already know that indicates that I would have to create that kind of scream later on as well.

204
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:26,272
And also put a note that it can attack from distance

205
00:10:26,272 --> 00:10:28,494
with a fireball, so I probably have to think

206
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:30,555
from the very start about my distance as well

207
00:10:30,555 --> 00:10:32,797
and what that brings to the table.

208
00:10:32,797 --> 00:10:35,819
And then on the right here on the left page,

209
00:10:35,819 --> 00:10:38,300
you can see how attack paints green

210
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,082
and how many variations I aim to do.

211
00:10:40,082 --> 00:10:43,804
And that equals total amount of 42 sound effects

212
00:10:43,804 --> 00:10:45,986
in this case, and this is a good indication.

213
00:10:45,986 --> 00:10:47,987
I can put that on a timeline

214
00:10:47,987 --> 00:10:49,308
and plan my time accordingly.

215
00:10:50,309 --> 00:10:55,731
And on the right, I think that's a very, for myself, it's very important, is the potential

216
00:10:55,731 --> 00:11:00,673
recordings I'm going to do, also the potential source I'm going to look at to just buy from

217
00:11:00,673 --> 00:11:02,074
other libraries out there.

218
00:11:02,074 --> 00:11:06,576
So, for example, I have the three types which we will hear later on more about, so humans,

219
00:11:06,576 --> 00:11:08,597
animals, and non-literal recordings.

220
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:12,058
And when I think about a random dragon in this case,

221
00:11:12,058 --> 00:11:14,099
I would think about, you know, I record myself

222
00:11:14,099 --> 00:11:16,580
because I can do a crazy inward squeal,

223
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,081
which would be a great layer for this sound.

224
00:11:18,081 --> 00:11:21,022
Or I can record Jack, who sounds like a pig, for example,

225
00:11:21,022 --> 00:11:23,063
which can be very useful.

226
00:11:23,063 --> 00:11:26,685
Then animals, I would, you know, look into pigs, horses,

227
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:28,485
donkeys, elephant, walrus, all that stuff,

228
00:11:28,485 --> 00:11:30,866
which, you know, kind of has some kind of quality

229
00:11:30,866 --> 00:11:33,067
I would look for in a dragon in this case.

230
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,428
And then also the non-literal stuff,

231
00:11:34,428 --> 00:11:37,809
like dry, some metal, cellophane, door creaks.

232
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,042
Stuff which doesn't really necessarily have anything to do

233
00:11:41,042 --> 00:11:42,182
with the dragon in the first place,

234
00:11:42,182 --> 00:11:44,884
but I, because I've done this stuff before,

235
00:11:44,884 --> 00:11:47,406
I can actually tell that might be really handy in the end

236
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:50,469
and add another bit of character to the creature.

237
00:11:50,469 --> 00:11:52,590
Right, so we have, we just ran through

238
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:55,292
the pre-production aspect,

239
00:11:55,292 --> 00:11:58,595
and we can finally look a bit into recording.

240
00:11:58,595 --> 00:12:00,376
Obviously for, most of you will know

241
00:12:00,376 --> 00:12:02,358
that different mics equals different results,

242
00:12:02,358 --> 00:12:04,719
so I'm going to show you a few of the microphones

243
00:12:04,719 --> 00:12:06,481
which I love using and which are really useful

244
00:12:06,481 --> 00:12:07,521
for creature sound recording.

245
00:12:08,663 --> 00:12:14,568
And I'm also going to talk about the literal approach of recording humans, which is, yeah,

246
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:15,148
very important.

247
00:12:15,148 --> 00:12:20,112
Then we're also going to look into recording animals, and very importantly, we're going

248
00:12:20,112 --> 00:12:23,575
to look at the non-literal approach, which is, in my opinion, the most interesting one.

249
00:12:23,575 --> 00:12:25,716
So let's have a look at the microphones.

250
00:12:25,716 --> 00:12:31,281
I'm going to show you a little bit of information and sound samples of the Sanken C100K, the

251
00:12:31,281 --> 00:12:34,123
Sennheiser MKH series, and some contact mics as well.

252
00:12:35,667 --> 00:12:39,893
So the Sankin C100K is, in my opinion, the most powerful weapon of a creature sound designer

253
00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:42,216
and that's because it just picks up signals up to 100 kilohertz.

254
00:12:42,216 --> 00:12:48,806
So it allows you, if you record in 192 sample rates, it just captures audio which is way

255
00:12:48,806 --> 00:12:51,369
beyond the human hearing.

256
00:12:51,369 --> 00:12:51,450
So...

257
00:12:52,411 --> 00:13:04,359
What that allows us to do is if we pitch down audio with a normal mic, you know, you would lose all this information as long as you go one octave down, you would make the sound very muffled and therefore unusable for our creature sound design purposes.

258
00:13:04,359 --> 00:13:16,006
But with the Sanken, and I really urge you to try it if you haven't done so before, you know, record yourself and pitch it down up to three octaves and it would still sound more or less crisp and really, really interesting.

259
00:13:16,807 --> 00:13:21,552
A downside of the Sanken is that it's unfortunately an omnidirectional mic which makes it very

260
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:24,175
difficult to use outdoors.

261
00:13:24,175 --> 00:13:26,857
But you know, it doesn't matter, you can still use it in the studio.

262
00:13:26,857 --> 00:13:31,282
And outdoors you just have to do a bit more cleaning up afterwards and denoising and de-birding

263
00:13:31,282 --> 00:13:32,523
and all that stuff.

264
00:13:32,523 --> 00:13:36,848
And also a good tip for anyone who wants to record outdoors with a Sanken is that it stops

265
00:13:36,848 --> 00:13:38,870
working below 10 degrees Celsius.

266
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:44,214
and so I don't want you guys to find out the way I did because it just stopped working. And how

267
00:13:44,214 --> 00:13:48,057
you can get around that is either wait for a warmer day or you know, you know these pocket

268
00:13:48,057 --> 00:13:52,481
warmers we have in the UK, once it gets really cold you just gaffer tape them to the mic and

269
00:13:52,481 --> 00:13:58,085
that gets around that as well. So I do have some example sounds recorded with the Sankin C100K. I

270
00:13:58,085 --> 00:14:03,870
think important for you guys to know is that it's uh the unpitched raw recording first and then the

271
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,211
processed and pitched sound after.

272
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:46,377
So the last example you heard of was actually one I created ages ago for Boom Library Creatures,

273
00:14:46,377 --> 00:14:47,798
for the designed one.

274
00:14:47,798 --> 00:14:49,159
And that just uses human sounds.

275
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:50,080
So you can see...

276
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,950
how powerful that Sanken is.

277
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:55,071
It really is breath-taking,

278
00:14:55,071 --> 00:14:56,331
so you should definitely give it a go.

279
00:14:56,331 --> 00:14:58,552
Second microphone we're going to look at

280
00:14:58,552 --> 00:15:00,672
is the Sennheiser MKH series.

281
00:15:00,672 --> 00:15:02,233
In my opinion, it's a great all-rounder.

282
00:15:02,233 --> 00:15:04,693
It's probably the mics I use most in the field.

283
00:15:04,693 --> 00:15:07,894
And yeah, it is a very popular choice

284
00:15:07,894 --> 00:15:08,855
for recording in the field

285
00:15:08,855 --> 00:15:11,815
because they, compared to the Sanken,

286
00:15:11,815 --> 00:15:13,156
they just pick up half the,

287
00:15:13,156 --> 00:15:15,597
they have half the frequency response of 50 kilohertz.

288
00:15:16,732 --> 00:15:18,573
but it's actually still great for pitching purposes,

289
00:15:18,573 --> 00:15:21,654
which you will hear in a minute.

290
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:23,555
And the positive aspect about the MKH series

291
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:25,296
that it's also available as cardioid

292
00:15:25,296 --> 00:15:27,177
or super cardioid configuration.

293
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:29,037
Therefore, you can use it as MS,

294
00:15:29,037 --> 00:15:31,699
which is probably 90% of the time what I'm doing.

295
00:15:31,699 --> 00:15:35,240
So again, in terms of here,

296
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,101
a sample with the MKH 8014 mono

297
00:15:38,101 --> 00:15:41,963
and the raw sound beforehand of myself

298
00:15:41,963 --> 00:15:43,464
and then pitched and processed.

299
00:15:51,246 --> 00:15:54,373
Mm-mmm.

300
00:15:54,373 --> 00:15:54,774
Up.

301
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:20,838
Yes, so again I think you can see that it's still very much usable as a layer in a creature sound

302
00:16:20,838 --> 00:16:25,043
and with the upside of, you know, being able to record in cardioid or supercardioid.

303
00:16:26,572 --> 00:16:28,652
The next mics we're going to look at are contact mics.

304
00:16:28,652 --> 00:16:31,994
So they are, compared to the Sanken and the Sennheiser

305
00:16:31,994 --> 00:16:33,654
microphones, they are actually quite pricey.

306
00:16:33,654 --> 00:16:36,375
They are, the Barker's Berry you can see here on the right,

307
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:39,356
it's actually not too pricey, normally very durable.

308
00:16:39,356 --> 00:16:41,497
I think this one would be about $300, $350,

309
00:16:41,497 --> 00:16:44,798
and it really is a great way to pick up different signals.

310
00:16:44,798 --> 00:16:48,780
So what we would normally do is we would have either

311
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:51,140
the Sanken or the Sennheiser mic in about a distance

312
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,281
like this here, like you can see right here,

313
00:16:53,281 --> 00:16:54,222
and then we would

314
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,783
We use a contact mic as a really, as a different source.

315
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:59,604
For example, I could put it on my throat

316
00:16:59,604 --> 00:17:01,606
to create something completely different,

317
00:17:01,606 --> 00:17:03,027
or I use it somewhere in the room,

318
00:17:03,027 --> 00:17:04,768
you know, something which is resonating,

319
00:17:04,768 --> 00:17:07,050
again, to pick up a different layer of interest,

320
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:10,073
and to be able to choose from that later on down the line.

321
00:17:10,073 --> 00:17:13,075
So, what you have to keep in mind is,

322
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:14,837
it picks up very dry and isolated signals,

323
00:17:14,837 --> 00:17:16,758
so whoever, you know, people in here

324
00:17:16,758 --> 00:17:18,700
have used contact mics before,

325
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,222
they're obviously very clean sounding, very isolated,

326
00:17:21,222 --> 00:17:24,064
don't really record much of the environment itself.

327
00:17:25,012 --> 00:17:29,454
And what's, I think what also is important to keep in mind is there's a very big difference

328
00:17:29,454 --> 00:17:33,376
between the budget and the high-end solutions. So the Barker's Berry has a massive frequency

329
00:17:33,376 --> 00:17:38,118
response and it is really, a really good source and I've used other cheaper contact mic

330
00:17:38,118 --> 00:17:43,121
solutions before which just don't give you the same, uh, fidelity. So let's also hear with

331
00:17:43,121 --> 00:17:46,482
the Barker's Berry, let's listen to a few sound recordings with that.

332
00:18:04,065 --> 00:18:07,647
So yeah, not necessarily something you would think that would make its way into a creature

333
00:18:07,647 --> 00:18:13,132
sound in the end, but again, really, really interesting source and, you know, it might

334
00:18:13,132 --> 00:18:18,937
work later on, we will see. Okay, so we have dealt with all the different mics I use on

335
00:18:18,937 --> 00:18:23,700
a daily basis and, you know, the positives and the negatives aspects of that. Now let's

336
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,922
look what we are actually going to record with those mics.

337
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,464
So human recordings first of all,

338
00:18:28,464 --> 00:18:29,885
they are very powerful sources,

339
00:18:29,885 --> 00:18:31,046
you just heard with the samples.

340
00:18:31,046 --> 00:18:33,148
Especially with the Sanken mic,

341
00:18:33,148 --> 00:18:35,910
but also with the Sennheiser.

342
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:38,372
And a positive aspect about humans

343
00:18:38,372 --> 00:18:40,473
is they usually perform on command

344
00:18:40,473 --> 00:18:41,874
and they can be directed.

345
00:18:41,874 --> 00:18:45,017
So there's obviously individuals who don't do that,

346
00:18:45,017 --> 00:18:46,478
but we don't talk about them.

347
00:18:46,478 --> 00:18:49,420
So normally they do what we tell them to do

348
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,301
and that's great.

349
00:18:50,301 --> 00:18:51,622
And they can also,

350
00:18:51,622 --> 00:18:54,184
they can normally be recorded in a controlled environment.

351
00:18:54,984 --> 00:18:59,407
It keeps down the time we have to spend on cleaning up all the stuff we record and it's

352
00:18:59,407 --> 00:19:01,428
just much more comfortable.

353
00:19:01,428 --> 00:19:04,610
And unless you're high accuracy, it can be done quite cheaply.

354
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:10,433
So what we tended to do in our Warhammer production, we just sent around emails.

355
00:19:11,011 --> 00:19:14,913
to the whole office and we asked can anyone do a really weird sound and ideally can you

356
00:19:14,913 --> 00:19:20,375
do it in an attacking way, in a painful way and you know in an idling way and we got a

357
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:25,297
few responses and we recorded them all and again what I tried to tell you before is just

358
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:30,059
you know record as much source as you can possibly think of because it might come in

359
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:31,220
handy later on down the line.

360
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:39,019
Yeah, so there's obviously not just positives about human recordings, because after recording

361
00:19:39,019 --> 00:19:42,925
loads of different human sounds, it can sound very similar once they're pitched and slowed

362
00:19:42,925 --> 00:19:43,305
down.

363
00:19:43,305 --> 00:19:43,485
So...

364
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:48,102
If I recorded all the people in the studio and later on,

365
00:19:48,102 --> 00:19:50,044
I pitched them down two to three octaves

366
00:19:50,044 --> 00:19:53,127
because I want to create some really deep sounding source

367
00:19:53,127 --> 00:19:55,229
and it can sound a bit like a mess

368
00:19:55,229 --> 00:19:57,010
and it's not really, again,

369
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:58,552
if we think about the three main ingredients,

370
00:19:58,552 --> 00:20:00,013
variation is always key.

371
00:20:00,013 --> 00:20:01,675
So we have to incorporate some different

372
00:20:01,675 --> 00:20:04,217
recording techniques with the humans

373
00:20:04,217 --> 00:20:07,140
to make them sound, to just make them stand out more.

374
00:20:08,191 --> 00:20:11,734
Another downside is that humans complain about sore throats and hoarseness.

375
00:20:11,734 --> 00:20:17,018
So ideally as a sound designer, I would like to keep it going until the vocal cords are

376
00:20:17,018 --> 00:20:22,663
just non-existent anymore, but obviously most people don't like doing that.

377
00:20:22,663 --> 00:20:24,444
And quite frankly said, it's not as much fun.

378
00:20:24,444 --> 00:20:31,170
I can spend hours in the studio and record humans, but I do much prefer doing what this

379
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:35,293
guy on the right here is doing, and going outdoors and actually capturing animal recordings.

380
00:20:36,094 --> 00:20:40,660
And animal recordings, they can be very rewarding as, like certain animals, they just produce

381
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:44,065
great and powerful sounds and they, you know, are conscious, reproduced by any humans.

382
00:20:44,065 --> 00:20:47,430
And unfortunately, they are very difficult to achieve and most animals don't make noises

383
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:47,691
on command.

384
00:20:47,691 --> 00:20:47,731
So...

385
00:20:47,731 --> 00:20:47,911
So, yeah.

386
00:20:47,911 --> 00:20:48,131
So, yeah.

387
00:20:48,131 --> 00:20:48,352
So, yeah.

388
00:20:48,352 --> 00:20:48,472
So, yeah.

389
00:20:48,472 --> 00:20:48,632
So, yeah.

390
00:20:48,632 --> 00:20:48,772
So, yeah.

391
00:20:48,772 --> 00:20:48,912
So, yeah.

392
00:20:48,912 --> 00:20:49,073
So, yeah.

393
00:20:49,073 --> 00:20:49,273
So, yeah.

394
00:20:49,273 --> 00:20:49,513
So, yeah.

395
00:20:49,513 --> 00:20:49,714
So, yeah.

396
00:20:49,714 --> 00:20:50,034
So, yeah.

397
00:20:50,034 --> 00:20:50,154
So, yeah.

398
00:20:50,154 --> 00:20:50,395
So, yeah.

399
00:20:51,075 --> 00:20:54,097
Anyone who, you know, a few people who went out there

400
00:20:54,097 --> 00:20:55,977
and tried to record animals, normally when you point

401
00:20:55,977 --> 00:20:58,218
your mic towards them, they're completely silent.

402
00:20:58,218 --> 00:21:01,519
But as soon as you turn away, they would just start vocalize.

403
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:04,580
So that's obviously annoying, and it's also time consuming.

404
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,801
So you have to spend a lot of time in the field

405
00:21:06,801 --> 00:21:08,802
recording animals to actually get what you're after.

406
00:21:08,802 --> 00:21:11,283
And yeah, and obviously it's mostly outdoors

407
00:21:11,283 --> 00:21:13,584
in an uncontrolled environment.

408
00:21:13,584 --> 00:21:16,985
So it's, you know, it brings a lot of editing time with it,

409
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:19,006
a lot of cleaning up time, and so on.

410
00:21:20,365 --> 00:21:22,647
But definitely sometime animal recordings

411
00:21:22,647 --> 00:21:23,727
are absolutely necessary.

412
00:21:23,727 --> 00:21:26,249
Again, in terms of variation, first of all,

413
00:21:26,249 --> 00:21:27,909
which I have mentioned just a minute ago.

414
00:21:27,909 --> 00:21:31,572
But also certain sounds, they can't be reproduced

415
00:21:31,572 --> 00:21:33,292
by humans, or at least I don't know any.

416
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,093
So if you do know any, just refer them to me

417
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:36,594
because I would like to hear that.

418
00:21:36,594 --> 00:21:40,216
For example, horses, bears, seals, vultures,

419
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:42,778
they just have some kind of, again, character to them,

420
00:21:42,778 --> 00:21:45,319
which is very difficult for a human to do.

421
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:47,380
So the real thing is definitely best in this case.

422
00:21:48,479 --> 00:21:53,280
Um, with animals they can be, animal recordings can be very pricey if agencies have to be

423
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:58,862
involved. So, due to the fact that it's a rare thing that a, an animal can, you know,

424
00:21:58,862 --> 00:22:04,483
vocalize on command. There are some peop, there are some agencies in the UK who specialize

425
00:22:04,483 --> 00:22:09,064
in, in advertising, you know, training animals for advertising and movie purposes. But they

426
00:22:09,064 --> 00:22:11,385
do know it's a rare thing and they charge you for it accordingly, so.

427
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,321
That's obviously a downside.

428
00:22:13,321 --> 00:22:16,103
And those recordings sometimes can also be dangerous.

429
00:22:16,103 --> 00:22:18,866
So I always, you know, when recording wild cats

430
00:22:18,866 --> 00:22:20,227
or stags in mating season,

431
00:22:20,227 --> 00:22:23,510
it really is better to be on the other side of the cage

432
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:27,293
or have a very, very long boom pole at your disposal.

433
00:22:29,082 --> 00:22:34,705
So just some tips for you guys in terms of animal recordings,

434
00:22:34,705 --> 00:22:38,808
because I'm sure some of you have actually not done one before.

435
00:22:38,808 --> 00:22:42,530
I think the first question you have to ask yourself before you go out in the field

436
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:44,111
is, where am I recording?

437
00:22:44,111 --> 00:22:45,892
So again, with us in the UK, it's very

438
00:22:46,572 --> 00:22:49,174
It's a very noisy environment, loads of fly path

439
00:22:49,174 --> 00:22:52,456
and birds and motorways, it's really not ideal.

440
00:22:52,456 --> 00:22:54,837
But you can obviously find spaces which are quiet enough

441
00:22:54,837 --> 00:22:56,498
to record those animals.

442
00:22:56,498 --> 00:22:59,360
So I would recommend to do a recce beforehand,

443
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,542
so just to go there and actually record the surroundings.

444
00:23:02,542 --> 00:23:04,663
Again, this is an advantage that you just put that

445
00:23:04,663 --> 00:23:08,026
in your archive and you can listen back to it later on.

446
00:23:08,026 --> 00:23:10,207
Or you could also share it with your teammates

447
00:23:10,207 --> 00:23:11,728
if you're not the one going on the recording

448
00:23:11,728 --> 00:23:12,588
but other people are.

449
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:16,107
You have to make yourself aware of what are you recording.

450
00:23:16,107 --> 00:23:18,549
You know, it's a difference of recording horses

451
00:23:18,549 --> 00:23:19,810
to recording wildcats.

452
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:22,192
You just might want to have more mics

453
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:24,333
to record horses or less mics.

454
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:27,116
So definitely make yourself aware of what you are recording.

455
00:23:27,116 --> 00:23:29,137
And also the question of how much do I think

456
00:23:29,137 --> 00:23:32,540
I can get out of it is something you might be confronted

457
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,461
by your lead or by your financial director

458
00:23:34,461 --> 00:23:37,243
because they want to know where you spent the money on.

459
00:23:37,243 --> 00:23:40,106
And it's a very difficult question to answer,

460
00:23:40,106 --> 00:23:40,826
but a tip for you.

461
00:23:41,487 --> 00:23:46,091
to really get out most of your recordings is to actually talk to the people who

462
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:49,415
take care of the animals or who train the animals, because they would normally

463
00:23:49,415 --> 00:23:52,878
know these little tricks. For example, before they get fed, they're

464
00:23:52,878 --> 00:23:55,821
really vocal. Or, you know, if you turn away one of the

465
00:23:55,821 --> 00:23:59,685
animals, then they start to get vocal. And all these tricks are really important

466
00:23:59,685 --> 00:24:02,067
for you to actually get the sound you're after.

467
00:24:02,067 --> 00:24:04,570
How dangerous is it going to be? Again, not really.

468
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:08,952
a good question I can help you with, just plan your insurance accordingly I guess.

469
00:24:08,952 --> 00:24:12,995
And what equipment do I need? As you can see on the right, that's our current

470
00:24:12,995 --> 00:24:17,297
Boom Library setup, which is obviously overpowered for most sessions, but

471
00:24:17,297 --> 00:24:21,319
I tend to take more stuff

472
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:24,841
out with me than I actually need to just in case some animal bites my

473
00:24:24,841 --> 00:24:27,983
windshield or bites my cable that I have a spare one in the car.

474
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:32,651
Right, so now we have dealt with the human recording aspect

475
00:24:32,651 --> 00:24:34,492
and the animals, I actually want to do a bit

476
00:24:34,492 --> 00:24:35,893
of a listening test with you guys.

477
00:24:35,893 --> 00:24:36,773
So I'll show you two sounds.

478
00:24:36,773 --> 00:24:41,075
And I want you to then lift your hand

479
00:24:41,075 --> 00:24:43,376
and you tell me which file is made

480
00:24:43,376 --> 00:24:45,317
just out of human sounds.

481
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:51,720
So that's sound number one.

482
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:56,242
I'll play you that again.

483
00:24:56,242 --> 00:24:57,163
And sound number two.

484
00:25:03,453 --> 00:25:03,973
Sound number three.

485
00:25:03,973 --> 00:25:04,474
Sound number three.

486
00:25:04,474 --> 00:25:08,236
Sound number three.

487
00:25:08,236 --> 00:25:08,997
Sound number three.

488
00:25:08,997 --> 00:25:10,258
Sound number three.

489
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:12,979
Sorry for that, I played them both together.

490
00:25:12,979 --> 00:25:14,521
So who of you thinks that sound number one

491
00:25:14,521 --> 00:25:17,342
was made just out of human sounds, please?

492
00:25:17,342 --> 00:25:17,863
Lift your hand.

493
00:25:17,863 --> 00:25:19,544
Okay, and what about sound number two?

494
00:25:19,544 --> 00:25:21,425
Yeah, great, I have to disappoint you, unfortunately.

495
00:25:21,425 --> 00:25:22,786
So sound number two was the one

496
00:25:22,786 --> 00:25:25,368
which wasn't made just out of human sounds.

497
00:25:25,368 --> 00:25:27,109
So sound number one, my good friend and colleague,

498
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:29,211
Byron Bullock made out of his own voice.

499
00:25:29,757 --> 00:25:32,699
And I don't know if it speaks for him to sound like a boar or pig,

500
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:34,640
but it's still very impressive.

501
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,863
And sound number two was a giant we had in Total War Warhammer.

502
00:25:37,863 --> 00:25:41,685
I vocalized that myself, but I had to, unfortunately,

503
00:25:41,685 --> 00:25:43,587
use some walrus sounds for the guttural thing

504
00:25:43,587 --> 00:25:45,708
because I just couldn't produce that sound.

505
00:25:45,708 --> 00:25:48,570
So very interesting, again, to hear how we are fooled

506
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:50,852
by the believability of that sound,

507
00:25:50,852 --> 00:25:52,733
especially that boar sound, sound number one.

508
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:56,561
Right, so now we're going to have a look at the non-literal approach.

509
00:25:56,561 --> 00:25:59,763
So some of the best layers, in my opinion, for creature sounds,

510
00:25:59,763 --> 00:26:02,004
they don't have to come from humans or animals.

511
00:26:02,004 --> 00:26:05,706
So, for example, think about tire squeals, balloon stretches,

512
00:26:05,706 --> 00:26:08,987
door creaks, dry ice and metal, high-pitched scrapes.

513
00:26:08,987 --> 00:26:12,829
These are all sounds which can make a real difference

514
00:26:12,829 --> 00:26:14,410
in creature sound design.

515
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:17,792
And a good advice I can give you is look for sounds and not for props.

516
00:26:17,792 --> 00:26:19,553
And what I mean by that is...

517
00:26:19,805 --> 00:26:24,029
You know, because I'm a bit of a sound nerd and I'm trying to, you know, I'm basically

518
00:26:24,029 --> 00:26:29,214
going through my day with open ears and I have my recorder in my bag or a notepad where

519
00:26:29,214 --> 00:26:33,118
if I hear something really weird and really interesting, I either take a note or record

520
00:26:33,118 --> 00:26:37,342
it on the spot so I can later on, it doesn't necessarily have to be a Sanken or, you know,

521
00:26:37,342 --> 00:26:41,507
the Sennheiser mic, but I can at least sketch that sound and I can come back to it later.

522
00:26:42,227 --> 00:26:46,572
And that's really important because the non-literal approach is not something you just, you know,

523
00:26:46,572 --> 00:26:50,917
get up in the morning and do, or if you can, then it's obviously great, but it's normally

524
00:26:50,917 --> 00:26:51,518
not the case.

525
00:26:51,518 --> 00:26:55,803
It can definitely add another layer of interest to the creature and make it sound different

526
00:26:55,803 --> 00:27:00,809
to everything else, and again, all about character and variation and the believability as well.

527
00:27:08,061 --> 00:27:12,525
So in this case, you could hear that's a non-literal recording of just some balloon scrapes.

528
00:27:12,525 --> 00:27:16,708
I blew up a balloon and just, you know, just dragged my fingers on that.

529
00:27:16,708 --> 00:27:20,652
And also, I combined that with a human scream.

530
00:27:20,652 --> 00:27:23,995
So if we listen to that again, just listen to how the first sound is the human squeal,

531
00:27:23,995 --> 00:27:28,258
and then it goes into that balloon and just sounds like nothing else.

532
00:27:28,258 --> 00:27:30,860
And that's really what I'm after in terms of creature sound design.

533
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,041
Let's listen to that again quickly.

534
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,621
So the non-literal approach is creatively

535
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:46,462
definitely biggest challenge because we,

536
00:27:46,462 --> 00:27:49,423
it just takes a lot of time to find the right props

537
00:27:49,423 --> 00:27:50,863
and the right sounds.

538
00:27:50,863 --> 00:27:53,324
But it is definitely the most rewarding

539
00:27:53,324 --> 00:27:55,445
because if you can tell someone that he created

540
00:27:55,445 --> 00:27:57,165
a great creature sound with just a balloon,

541
00:27:57,165 --> 00:27:59,426
they'd probably be amazed.

542
00:27:59,426 --> 00:28:02,647
And that's obviously what we want as sound designers.

543
00:28:02,647 --> 00:28:04,687
We want the recognition of our other colleagues

544
00:28:04,687 --> 00:28:07,468
because most people, most players wouldn't actually

545
00:28:07,468 --> 00:28:08,989
know to tell the difference.

546
00:28:08,989 --> 00:28:10,429
It's also very time consuming.

547
00:28:11,575 --> 00:28:14,958
you know, again, because it's just a very time consuming process to find all these different

548
00:28:14,958 --> 00:28:15,219
sounds.

549
00:28:15,219 --> 00:28:19,583
And finding the right spots and props to record can be very difficult.

550
00:28:19,583 --> 00:28:23,787
So again, my tip for all of you is to just listen out for stuff like that.

551
00:28:23,787 --> 00:28:27,950
Like today in the morning I opened my hotel door and it sounded like, I think it's called

552
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:33,055
MOTU, the Godzilla movie, and yeah, so I recorded it and I'll come back to it later and hopefully

553
00:28:33,055 --> 00:28:35,157
can use it in one of the future projects.

554
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:41,115
So the next video I'm going to show you is a combination of some of the non-literal recordings

555
00:28:41,115 --> 00:28:44,978
we did for Total War Warhammer, also some of the animal recordings as well.

556
00:29:19,683 --> 00:29:25,105
Unfortunately I have to say that the last cow sound didn't make it in the game.

557
00:29:25,105 --> 00:29:28,467
But I'm still amazed that I can actually reproduce a cow sound.

558
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:33,450
So all my people in Austria are incredibly proud of me.

559
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:37,071
So now we actually went through the pre-production process,

560
00:29:37,071 --> 00:29:39,793
the recording process, and finally we can actually,

561
00:29:39,793 --> 00:29:42,794
what we always wanted to do, we can get stuck into design bit.

562
00:29:42,794 --> 00:29:45,316
So this is the process where it all comes together.

563
00:29:46,223 --> 00:29:48,605
And ideally after doing all these processes

564
00:29:48,605 --> 00:29:51,307
and different recordings, we would know

565
00:29:51,307 --> 00:29:53,689
what we want to try to achieve by now.

566
00:29:53,689 --> 00:29:56,811
But sometimes it can still feel more like

567
00:29:56,811 --> 00:29:58,853
throwing paint on a canvas and seeing what happens.

568
00:29:58,853 --> 00:30:01,835
And this is absolutely fine because at this stage,

569
00:30:01,835 --> 00:30:05,418
still now, it's still a lot of experimenting with sounds.

570
00:30:05,418 --> 00:30:07,380
And I will also show you a video in a minute

571
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,301
where you can see the struggle of trying

572
00:30:09,301 --> 00:30:11,363
to make these different layers work together.

573
00:30:11,703 --> 00:30:14,184
And I think at this point I have to stress that the door

574
00:30:14,184 --> 00:30:16,825
of your choice is actually not important.

575
00:30:16,825 --> 00:30:18,786
So I hear loads of people telling me that Reaper sounds

576
00:30:18,786 --> 00:30:21,767
more analog or Logic is super smooth and all that stuff,

577
00:30:21,767 --> 00:30:25,749
but I can really say that you should stick to the tools

578
00:30:25,749 --> 00:30:28,210
you're feeling comfortable with and also feel comfortable

579
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:30,571
with spending hours and hours on one kind of sound.

580
00:30:30,571 --> 00:30:33,773
And unless you obviously have to collaborate with people

581
00:30:33,773 --> 00:30:37,714
because then it obviously dictates what you have to use

582
00:30:37,714 --> 00:30:40,155
and it makes it much easier to share projects and files

583
00:30:40,155 --> 00:30:41,316
with your coworkers.

584
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:46,629
So just a basic, obviously a basic statement now.

585
00:30:46,629 --> 00:30:48,855
Creature sound design consists of layers.

586
00:30:48,855 --> 00:30:49,917
I think you got that by now.

587
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:53,161
Everything I showed you over the last half an hour,

588
00:30:53,161 --> 00:30:55,881
there is, you know, hardly ever there will be one sound

589
00:30:55,881 --> 00:30:56,581
which is enough.

590
00:30:56,581 --> 00:30:59,402
So even though we create a great source material

591
00:30:59,402 --> 00:31:01,442
with the Sanken, it still needs to be layered up

592
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:03,803
with different material to, you know,

593
00:31:03,803 --> 00:31:06,804
to get to that character we always are after

594
00:31:06,804 --> 00:31:08,724
and to get to that believable creature.

595
00:31:08,724 --> 00:31:11,485
So the art of creature sound design

596
00:31:11,485 --> 00:31:13,445
is to make all the different layers work together

597
00:31:13,445 --> 00:31:15,865
and sound like a homogenous creature,

598
00:31:15,865 --> 00:31:18,046
like one creature and not like many creatures.

599
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:23,116
And so we have to focus our attention on the tonal relation between the different layers.

600
00:31:23,116 --> 00:31:28,087
And that's, I think in my opinion, that's the most important aspect of creature sound design.

601
00:31:28,087 --> 00:31:29,008
It's not the plugins.

602
00:31:29,755 --> 00:31:33,098
it is the source and the tonal relation to each other.

603
00:31:33,098 --> 00:31:35,860
So let's have a look at a video I put together.

604
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:38,522
I'll try to show you the importance of, first of all,

605
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:40,724
how the pitch between the different layers works together.

606
00:31:40,724 --> 00:31:42,245
I think it's important for you to know

607
00:31:42,245 --> 00:31:45,127
that it's not intended to sound super crazy awesome

608
00:31:45,127 --> 00:31:48,209
at the end, but I think you will get the message.

609
00:31:48,209 --> 00:31:49,270
Just have a look at this video now.

610
00:32:36,804 --> 00:32:36,991
you

611
00:32:51,021 --> 00:32:52,821
So yeah, I think you can see the struggle here.

612
00:32:52,821 --> 00:32:55,722
So the initial sound, I was actually happy to start with

613
00:32:55,722 --> 00:33:01,424
the growl sound, where all the other layers are kind of

614
00:33:01,424 --> 00:33:05,385
pitched to match that initial sound, but then I decided

615
00:33:05,385 --> 00:33:08,566
in the end to add an intro sound, which I again really like,

616
00:33:08,566 --> 00:33:11,447
but then it completely messed up the tonal relation

617
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:13,667
of my initial layer, so I had to pitch down

618
00:33:13,667 --> 00:33:14,287
the initial layer.

619
00:33:14,287 --> 00:33:18,209
And this is a very simple example of a very big problem,

620
00:33:18,209 --> 00:33:19,129
you know, where you just have to

621
00:33:20,089 --> 00:33:22,952
Still experiment with different layers, different source.

622
00:33:22,952 --> 00:33:25,694
You find yourself deleting stuff, grabbing new stuff.

623
00:33:25,694 --> 00:33:28,457
And again, it all comes down to the source and what you

624
00:33:28,457 --> 00:33:32,281
recorded beforehand or what you bought library-wise to

625
00:33:32,281 --> 00:33:35,123
really be able to choose from a large

626
00:33:35,123 --> 00:33:36,465
amount of source material.

627
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:42,948
So I like to think that approaching those designs can be a bit like arranging music,

628
00:33:42,948 --> 00:33:44,609
because of the whole pitching relationship.

629
00:33:44,609 --> 00:33:50,834
So if you think of a guitar riff and the bass playing to it, then it could either sound

630
00:33:50,834 --> 00:33:54,657
in tune, perfectly in tune and it harmonises, or it can sound out of tune and a bit bad

631
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:56,999
and just not really matching.

632
00:33:56,999 --> 00:34:00,803
So pitch matching is the most important and plugins can't take that work off you.

633
00:34:00,803 --> 00:34:03,345
So again, similar to the guitar example.

634
00:34:04,005 --> 00:34:08,327
the creature sound like the high element, the hiss for example, and the bass element,

635
00:34:08,327 --> 00:34:11,808
so the kind of body resonance, they have to match together.

636
00:34:11,808 --> 00:34:16,849
Otherwise it will sound not believable and it will sound like many creatures rather than

637
00:34:16,849 --> 00:34:19,110
one homogenous one.

638
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:22,311
So in my opinion, and I think that's quite important for the way I work, is that good

639
00:34:22,311 --> 00:34:24,792
source can allow you to work with just volume and EQ.

640
00:34:25,372 --> 00:34:29,315
Again, the example I just showed you is not really sounding that great, but you can still

641
00:34:29,315 --> 00:34:34,219
tell that it could potentially be great, but there's actually nothing, no plugins are in

642
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:34,419
there.

643
00:34:34,419 --> 00:34:39,503
This is just recordings I made and just pitch, volume, and I think in the example not even

644
00:34:39,503 --> 00:34:39,743
EQ.

645
00:34:39,743 --> 00:34:45,487
But, nevertheless, there's still plugins out there which are a must-have for every creature

646
00:34:45,487 --> 00:34:49,870
sound designer and sound designer in general, and I want to show you some of those which

647
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:51,191
I use on a daily basis.

648
00:34:51,191 --> 00:34:53,713
So first of all, it's Isotope by X.

649
00:34:53,713 --> 00:34:54,614
Morph 2.

650
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:58,672
elastic pitch, the MAGICU, waves lower air,

651
00:34:58,672 --> 00:35:01,995
and also crotas dehumanizer too.

652
00:35:01,995 --> 00:35:03,636
So I think it's important to mention that,

653
00:35:03,636 --> 00:35:05,557
you know, I could probably fill another talk.

654
00:35:06,295 --> 00:35:12,801
at GDC about iZotope, about its functions and how it makes my life so much easier.

655
00:35:12,801 --> 00:35:18,046
Just simply anyone who goes out in the field or who works in post-production probably has

656
00:35:18,046 --> 00:35:23,410
used iZotope before and we just de-noise stuff, de-click stuff, you know, draw our birds from

657
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:24,351
recordings.

658
00:35:24,351 --> 00:35:28,815
It really is a powerful tool everyone should have a look at if you haven't done so before.

659
00:35:30,149 --> 00:35:35,952
Synaptic Morph 2. So this is a plugin which has been around for quite a while and somehow

660
00:35:35,952 --> 00:35:40,014
it just completely went past me and I didn't know until just a few months or actually I

661
00:35:40,014 --> 00:35:46,038
think a year ago. And what it basically does, just a simple explanation, it takes one spectral

662
00:35:46,038 --> 00:35:51,421
characteristic of one sound and projects it to another. And I mean just, you know, saying

663
00:35:51,421 --> 00:35:55,323
that actually sounds pretty cool for my purposes. So have a listen to that example I just put

664
00:35:55,323 --> 00:35:56,363
something together for you.

665
00:36:01,913 --> 00:36:08,200
So in this example I have a metal groan, a non-literal recording morphed with an elephant roar.

666
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:13,186
And I mean it's just amazing. Let's listen to it again. I actually want to hear it again.

667
00:36:18,023 --> 00:36:21,669
And this is so, you know, again, another out of this world example which you wouldn't get

668
00:36:21,669 --> 00:36:25,855
if you just record an elephant or metal groan, but put together, putting that time into just

669
00:36:25,855 --> 00:36:30,361
experiment with different layers and with the help of this great tool here, really is

670
00:36:30,361 --> 00:36:30,682
worth it.

671
00:36:30,682 --> 00:36:31,883
So have a look at that as well.

672
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:36,300
Elastic Pitch, that's just a plugin I love using

673
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,980
for not just pitching stuff down,

674
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,541
but actually automating the pitch over time.

675
00:36:40,541 --> 00:36:42,521
So what I'm also trying to do with my creatures,

676
00:36:42,521 --> 00:36:45,722
I'm trying to automate pitch with movement.

677
00:36:45,722 --> 00:36:49,723
So for example, if one of my creatures would die in game,

678
00:36:49,723 --> 00:36:51,263
I try to get the asset to pitch down

679
00:36:51,263 --> 00:36:52,564
when it's actually falling over,

680
00:36:52,564 --> 00:36:54,744
almost make it sound like a final breath.

681
00:36:54,744 --> 00:36:56,404
And this plugin does it in a really nice way.

682
00:36:56,404 --> 00:36:58,725
It doesn't color the sound in any way,

683
00:36:58,725 --> 00:37:00,125
and it also doesn't step the pitch,

684
00:37:00,125 --> 00:37:01,286
which some other plugins do,

685
00:37:01,286 --> 00:37:02,746
so that's a great one to look at as well.

686
00:37:03,246 --> 00:37:07,928
The Magi-Q is actually something which most people don't know about.

687
00:37:07,928 --> 00:37:11,669
I think that's kind of a little secret to share with you guys,

688
00:37:11,669 --> 00:37:16,051
especially the orange 2.5 kHz knob and the air gain.

689
00:37:16,051 --> 00:37:20,833
Because of the nature of our layers where we all pitch them down quite heavily,

690
00:37:20,833 --> 00:37:24,174
sometimes even though we record with the Senken or the Sennheiser,

691
00:37:24,174 --> 00:37:25,935
we lose some of the high fidelity.

692
00:37:26,455 --> 00:37:32,218
And I find that if I used those two knobs here that I can just inject a bit of life back

693
00:37:32,218 --> 00:37:36,781
into them, a bit of brilliance and a bit of sparkle. Which is, again, sounds like a very

694
00:37:36,781 --> 00:37:40,843
basic thing but it actually does make a difference. So, again, if you have the chance,

695
00:37:40,843 --> 00:37:46,367
download the demo and try it yourself. Waves Low Air, I don't think I have to say too much

696
00:37:46,367 --> 00:37:50,329
about that. It's just a plug-in I've been using for years and it helps me with creating the

697
00:37:50,329 --> 00:37:55,392
kind of bassiness and the bigness of a sound. And, again...

698
00:37:56,448 --> 00:38:01,111
highly recommended to anyone, sound design in general, but also for creature sound designs.

699
00:38:01,111 --> 00:38:09,075
And then Crotus Dehumanizer 2 which is, I think, is a great tool because I think version 1 was

700
00:38:09,075 --> 00:38:14,818
already amazing, but for me it was the downside that it was a standalone plugin, I couldn't use

701
00:38:14,818 --> 00:38:21,082
it in Pro Tools, my DAW of choice. So what they've done with Dehumanizer 2 is amazing because you have

702
00:38:21,522 --> 00:38:25,363
I don't know how many hundred parameters there are in this plugin and it's also on a modular

703
00:38:25,363 --> 00:38:31,165
basis so you can drag in whatever you want. And it's also fully automatable and uh you can

704
00:38:31,165 --> 00:38:36,047
really lose yourself in again you know what I tried to to tell you guys today is just to

705
00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:41,189
experiment and with this plugin you have uh yeah you have a lot to do if you want to just you

706
00:38:41,189 --> 00:38:45,070
know experience all the functions. There's a lot of time to be spending that plugin and also

707
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:50,212
Crotus are here at GDC so have a look at at their booth if you wanna if you wanna know more

708
00:38:50,212 --> 00:38:50,852
about their plugin.

709
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:55,341
So I've got another video for you.

710
00:38:55,341 --> 00:38:58,102
This is actually a creature which made it

711
00:38:58,102 --> 00:39:00,803
in the final release of Total War Warhammer.

712
00:39:00,803 --> 00:39:03,083
It's a dragon ogre, a large dragon ogre.

713
00:39:03,083 --> 00:39:07,305
And I tried to, I again captured my proto session here

714
00:39:07,305 --> 00:39:08,985
and I'll show you every single layer.

715
00:39:08,985 --> 00:39:11,346
You can see what it does and you can see

716
00:39:11,346 --> 00:39:13,486
it sounds quite odd when you play it by themselves

717
00:39:13,486 --> 00:39:15,187
but actually when they all play together,

718
00:39:15,187 --> 00:39:16,807
at least in my opinion, they sound quite cool

719
00:39:16,807 --> 00:39:18,048
and they sound pretty much believable.

720
00:39:18,048 --> 00:39:18,828
Let's have a look at that.

721
00:40:26,029 --> 00:40:29,671
Yeah, so you can see the layers by themselves don't sound like much,

722
00:40:29,671 --> 00:40:34,334
and it just takes a lot of time for me to just pitch them all together,

723
00:40:34,334 --> 00:40:37,356
and then, you know, the high elements would lose all their bass,

724
00:40:37,356 --> 00:40:40,838
and with the bass layers I would try and emphasize their bass,

725
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:43,319
and then at the end I'd get to something like this, and I'm very happy,

726
00:40:43,319 --> 00:40:46,762
but then I have to do five or six variations, and I'm again very sad.

727
00:40:46,762 --> 00:40:47,342
So, um...

728
00:40:48,709 --> 00:40:51,211
Yeah, I think that's a good example of how it's been broken down.

729
00:40:51,211 --> 00:40:55,693
And, you know, this is actually an example where I used quite a lot of different layers

730
00:40:55,693 --> 00:41:01,417
because I try sometimes to limit myself because obviously the less layers I use, the easier

731
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:04,158
it gets for me to actually get them work together.

732
00:41:05,593 --> 00:41:13,579
Right, so after the pre-production part, the recording part, and also the design part, we do

733
00:41:13,579 --> 00:41:18,863
have to look into implementation, which is the last part of the process, apart from the mix,

734
00:41:18,863 --> 00:41:24,246
obviously. And I think it's so important these days that if the implementation is bad, even the

735
00:41:24,246 --> 00:41:30,611
best sound can't save it. So it does make me very upset if I spend that much time on a sound.

736
00:41:30,771 --> 00:41:33,752
you know, like weeks or maybe a week or two weeks,

737
00:41:33,752 --> 00:41:35,773
and then in the end in the game,

738
00:41:35,773 --> 00:41:39,455
it just doesn't sound the way I expect it to sound.

739
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:41,336
So we are dependent on great systems for sounds

740
00:41:41,336 --> 00:41:42,737
to make them shine properly.

741
00:41:42,737 --> 00:41:44,598
We really have to, you know,

742
00:41:44,598 --> 00:41:46,859
this is very important that they actually do,

743
00:41:46,859 --> 00:41:48,900
in Pro Tools or in your DAW, they sound great,

744
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,281
but as soon as they come in the game,

745
00:41:50,281 --> 00:41:52,121
there's so many different factors,

746
00:41:52,121 --> 00:41:54,443
and obviously the mix has to work around it,

747
00:41:54,443 --> 00:41:56,784
and it's really important to get stuck into implementation.

748
00:41:57,564 --> 00:42:01,227
So in my opinion, implementation is 50% the experience.

749
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:03,768
Again, it's completely useless to spend all this time

750
00:42:03,768 --> 00:42:06,390
and all these processes if the implementation is bad.

751
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:10,373
But I also have to say there's countless possibilities

752
00:42:10,373 --> 00:42:11,473
of implementing audio.

753
00:42:11,473 --> 00:42:13,275
So anyone who worked in games before

754
00:42:13,275 --> 00:42:15,476
knows that there's so many different things.

755
00:42:15,476 --> 00:42:17,137
There's Wwise, there's FMOD, there's

756
00:42:17,137 --> 00:42:18,438
so many different engines.

757
00:42:18,438 --> 00:42:21,840
Every company works with different tools.

758
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,822
And therefore, I can't, unfortunately, just

759
00:42:24,822 --> 00:42:26,063
show you everything about the.

760
00:42:26,843 --> 00:42:31,228
about implementing creature sounds, but what I decided to do is actually to give you again

761
00:42:31,228 --> 00:42:35,872
some tips which helped me in the past, especially when working on Total War Warhammer, a very

762
00:42:35,872 --> 00:42:40,336
creature heavy game, you know, for you just to maybe gain some inspiration from.

763
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:48,335
So I think in terms of creature sound design, the hierarchy set up is incredibly important.

764
00:42:48,335 --> 00:42:53,059
So again in terms of Warhammer, we had small, medium, large and extra large and huge creatures.

765
00:42:53,059 --> 00:42:58,243
So again this is a hierarchy decision we had to make very early on in the process

766
00:42:58,243 --> 00:43:03,208
because you know many people work on that game and we have to later on mix that stuff as well.

767
00:43:03,208 --> 00:43:06,310
So it's very important to always keep that kind of hierarchy together,

768
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:08,192
almost like the layers of a creature sound design.

769
00:43:08,973 --> 00:43:11,635
Because it does make it easier in the end

770
00:43:11,635 --> 00:43:13,797
to make the large creature sounds bigger

771
00:43:13,797 --> 00:43:16,479
than everything else and not to lose yourself

772
00:43:16,479 --> 00:43:19,982
in the hierarchy in the end.

773
00:43:19,982 --> 00:43:21,504
Another very interesting aspect,

774
00:43:21,504 --> 00:43:23,085
which unfortunately I don't really have time

775
00:43:23,085 --> 00:43:24,767
to get too much into today,

776
00:43:24,767 --> 00:43:28,390
is the modular approach versus the one-shot approach.

777
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:30,272
So everything I've showed you today

778
00:43:30,272 --> 00:43:32,033
was all based on one-shot.

779
00:43:32,033 --> 00:43:34,215
So for example, I have an attack animation,

780
00:43:34,215 --> 00:43:35,336
I make this attack sound.

781
00:43:35,697 --> 00:43:37,457
and it would just, you know, I put a trigger point

782
00:43:37,457 --> 00:43:40,718
into the animation, it would play in game and happy days.

783
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:42,998
But sometimes it can be necessary

784
00:43:42,998 --> 00:43:44,638
that there's so many different animations,

785
00:43:44,638 --> 00:43:47,259
a basic sound set of articulations,

786
00:43:47,259 --> 00:43:49,539
like I showed you before of my random dragon example

787
00:43:49,539 --> 00:43:51,660
with 42 sounds, would just not do it

788
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:53,620
because there's too many animations

789
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:57,801
and they would just not sync tightly to the animations.

790
00:43:57,801 --> 00:44:00,841
So what we tried to do in some cases with Warhammer

791
00:44:00,841 --> 00:44:02,842
and with other games as well is that we tried to,

792
00:44:02,842 --> 00:44:03,802
for example, a scream.

793
00:44:04,682 --> 00:44:06,744
we would divide them up in three parts,

794
00:44:06,744 --> 00:44:10,146
like a start sound, a middle sound, and a stop sound,

795
00:44:10,146 --> 00:44:13,928
which makes it, of course, that's great for variation purposes,

796
00:44:13,928 --> 00:44:17,290
but anyone who has tried to blend them in-game before,

797
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:18,351
it's, again, quite tricky.

798
00:44:18,351 --> 00:44:20,633
So you have to lay a problem in the first place,

799
00:44:20,633 --> 00:44:23,414
and then you also have to blend between those three parts

800
00:44:23,414 --> 00:44:24,915
in the game engine, which can be tricky.

801
00:44:24,915 --> 00:44:27,477
But again, if you pull it off, it sounds amazing in-game

802
00:44:27,477 --> 00:44:31,119
because you have the best amount of variation.

803
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:35,860
Distant versus close assets, I think that's a very basic thing to say.

804
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:40,721
It probably seems a bit stupid to talk about it, but I think it's incredibly important,

805
00:44:40,721 --> 00:44:45,982
again, if we think about the three main ingredients of our perspective, that we always, as a rule,

806
00:44:45,982 --> 00:44:48,943
and I don't know who set that rule, but whenever I start a creature sound design,

807
00:44:48,943 --> 00:44:53,023
I start with a close-up, close to the camera kind of sound.

808
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:57,164
But sometimes it would actually be good to start with a distant sound before

809
00:44:57,164 --> 00:44:59,705
and then work yourself, you know, towards the close sound.

810
00:45:00,345 --> 00:45:03,909
And how we solved that in Wwise before is that we just had a closed sound,

811
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:06,471
we had a distant sound which was created after closed sound,

812
00:45:06,471 --> 00:45:09,975
but sometimes had to lose some of the layers to actually make it sound distant.

813
00:45:09,975 --> 00:45:12,217
So again, another problem we were facing.

814
00:45:12,217 --> 00:45:17,843
And then we just blend them over distance and with in-game parameters like a cue or reverb.

815
00:45:19,123 --> 00:45:21,284
Use of cone attenuation I think was something

816
00:45:21,284 --> 00:45:24,365
which really changed the way we were mixing our games as well.

817
00:45:24,365 --> 00:45:26,726
So you can imagine that like a cone coming out

818
00:45:26,726 --> 00:45:29,247
of the creature's mouth.

819
00:45:29,247 --> 00:45:30,968
And whenever it turns away from the camera,

820
00:45:30,968 --> 00:45:32,508
the perspective would change accordingly.

821
00:45:32,508 --> 00:45:34,769
And you can automate the EQ, not automate,

822
00:45:34,769 --> 00:45:37,730
but the game engine would deal with the EQ settings,

823
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:40,011
like low pass and high pass and all that.

824
00:45:40,011 --> 00:45:42,372
And it would just, again, work on the believability

825
00:45:42,372 --> 00:45:45,113
of our game and work on the believability of our creature

826
00:45:45,113 --> 00:45:45,313
sound.

827
00:45:46,103 --> 00:45:48,405
Volume equals size, make use of it.

828
00:45:48,405 --> 00:45:50,406
This is another really basic thing.

829
00:45:50,406 --> 00:45:52,547
And you probably laugh about it if I tell you that,

830
00:45:52,547 --> 00:45:55,328
you know, obviously large creatures should be

831
00:45:55,328 --> 00:45:57,369
louder than small creatures.

832
00:45:57,369 --> 00:45:59,230
But I don't know why it happens so much,

833
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:00,991
but if I look at a hierarchy,

834
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:02,191
small, medium, large creatures,

835
00:46:02,191 --> 00:46:04,012
every starting point is actually zero dB

836
00:46:04,012 --> 00:46:06,673
or minus 10 or whatever, but they're all equal.

837
00:46:07,013 --> 00:46:10,695
And it's actually a good starting point to just, you know, do that gain staging

838
00:46:10,695 --> 00:46:14,376
in a really simple way beforehand because it just really

839
00:46:14,376 --> 00:46:16,636
makes the whole mixing process so much easier in the end.

840
00:46:16,636 --> 00:46:21,578
And another thing, the sweetener layers, which is something we made use of heavily,

841
00:46:21,578 --> 00:46:24,178
not just for creature sounds but also for other sound effects.

842
00:46:24,178 --> 00:46:28,700
But for example, if we had big dragon sound, like the huge creatures, like the giants and the dragons.

843
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:31,282
we could actually, if they're very close to the camera,

844
00:46:31,282 --> 00:46:33,464
we would play a sweetener sound on top of that,

845
00:46:33,464 --> 00:46:36,066
something we created just for that effect

846
00:46:36,066 --> 00:46:40,390
to add a proximity effect, which could be a stereo sound

847
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:43,032
or a quad sound even to really fill out that space

848
00:46:43,032 --> 00:46:46,255
and to make that huge creature, which is already huge,

849
00:46:46,255 --> 00:46:48,236
make even more huge, because that's what we want.

850
00:46:48,236 --> 00:46:51,119
We want to make everything sound really loud and powerful.

851
00:46:52,358 --> 00:46:55,165
So yeah, we are pretty much at the end of my presentation.

852
00:46:55,165 --> 00:46:57,792
I'll just give you a summary of the most important aspects

853
00:46:57,792 --> 00:46:59,556
what I've been talking about today.

854
00:47:00,725 --> 00:47:02,526
Again, pre-production is key.

855
00:47:02,526 --> 00:47:04,168
You definitely have to know what you're working on.

856
00:47:04,168 --> 00:47:07,090
I think it's, again, very important to mention

857
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:09,772
that pre-production is important,

858
00:47:09,772 --> 00:47:13,035
and it is worth it reading all the books

859
00:47:13,035 --> 00:47:15,777
about the creatures, get to know their characteristics

860
00:47:15,777 --> 00:47:18,099
and special skills, because it will pay off

861
00:47:18,099 --> 00:47:21,102
in your recording process later on, and also in the design,

862
00:47:21,102 --> 00:47:22,543
and you will always be in brief,

863
00:47:22,543 --> 00:47:23,784
or most of the time anyway.

864
00:47:27,067 --> 00:47:30,971
Be creative with the recording process, but sometimes the most simple approach can get

865
00:47:30,971 --> 00:47:34,195
the most satisfying result, trial and error.

866
00:47:34,195 --> 00:47:38,240
So again, with the recording process, it's all about recording as much as you can, you

867
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:42,605
know, really don't be scared to go out there and just record all day, edit it up, put it

868
00:47:42,605 --> 00:47:46,149
in your library, and then later on you can choose from that stuff.

869
00:47:46,149 --> 00:47:48,111
I can't stress enough how important it is to...

870
00:47:48,271 --> 00:47:53,995
really, you know, have enough source to choose from. Because when I talk to, to some of you

871
00:47:53,995 --> 00:47:58,939
guys beforehand, before this actual talk, the first question I've always, or I'm most of the

872
00:47:58,939 --> 00:48:04,323
time being asked is, what plugins do you use? And again, I think my plugin and my plugin is

873
00:48:04,323 --> 00:48:09,066
the source. And I think nobody can take that away from you if you really record as much as

874
00:48:09,066 --> 00:48:09,526
possible.

875
00:48:10,831 --> 00:48:14,793
Pitch matching EQ and volume, those three ingredients work with good source.

876
00:48:14,793 --> 00:48:18,235
So again, this is in terms of the design process, obviously.

877
00:48:18,235 --> 00:48:20,697
Stick with those three things for a start.

878
00:48:20,697 --> 00:48:24,359
You know, match the pitch, EQ the elements you want to,

879
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:27,340
and then do the volume offsets, do some fades.

880
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:30,382
And I'm pretty sure it will get you far away.

881
00:48:30,382 --> 00:48:33,964
And I think it's, you know, and afterwards you can use all the plugins in the world,

882
00:48:33,964 --> 00:48:38,227
but just make sure that the first step is always pitch matching EQ and volume.

883
00:48:39,653 --> 00:48:43,337
And I think most importantly, get stuck into implementation if you can.

884
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:45,880
If you're freelance, at least try to get involved.

885
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:48,843
So I'm now in a position where I'm freelance again.

886
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:53,268
And I do want to make sure that my sounds end up in the game as intended

887
00:48:53,268 --> 00:48:55,871
and to sound as good as possible, obviously.

888
00:48:55,871 --> 00:49:00,776
And if you're in-house, talk to the implementation team.

889
00:49:01,768 --> 00:49:04,350
Sorry, get stuck into implementation.

890
00:49:04,350 --> 00:49:06,231
Obviously in the in-house it's much easier

891
00:49:06,231 --> 00:49:08,012
because you're actually on the spot

892
00:49:08,012 --> 00:49:10,274
and you don't have to write as many emails

893
00:49:10,274 --> 00:49:11,775
as I have to do normally.

894
00:49:11,775 --> 00:49:15,397
And then finally, believability and character,

895
00:49:15,397 --> 00:49:18,039
the most important aspects of creature sound design.

896
00:49:19,458 --> 00:49:23,901
If you think about what we're trying to achieve with, you know, the whole creating games in the first place,

897
00:49:23,901 --> 00:49:29,866
we want to create a universe for the player to get immersed in and, you know, to feel at home in a way.

898
00:49:29,866 --> 00:49:34,609
And that's exactly what we're trying to do, what we're trying to achieve with our creature sounds as well.

899
00:49:34,609 --> 00:49:41,634
To make them believable and, you know, to kind of define their character of something which isn't real in the real world,

900
00:49:41,634 --> 00:49:44,776
but obviously real because designers designed it.

901
00:49:44,776 --> 00:49:46,658
So it's all about believability and character.

902
00:49:48,036 --> 00:49:52,603
So, yeah, thank you very much for your attention.

903
00:49:52,603 --> 00:49:54,826
I think that's pretty much it.

904
00:49:54,826 --> 00:49:58,230
Actually, if you could fill out the evaluation form,

905
00:49:58,230 --> 00:50:00,273
that would be great, because we always like to get feedback

906
00:50:00,273 --> 00:50:01,515
on the talks.

907
00:50:01,515 --> 00:50:03,177
And I hope you enjoyed it, and obviously I'm

908
00:50:03,177 --> 00:50:05,180
looking forward to answering all your questions now.

909
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:23,492
So I'm curious about your process for making variations.

910
00:50:23,492 --> 00:50:25,674
So once you have the first variation,

911
00:50:25,674 --> 00:50:28,815
do you tend to be able to just rely on modulating

912
00:50:28,815 --> 00:50:30,536
those existing source assets?

913
00:50:30,536 --> 00:50:32,597
Or do you have to bring in totally different assets

914
00:50:32,597 --> 00:50:33,598
for the other variations?

915
00:50:33,772 --> 00:50:40,054
Yeah, so that's actually a very good question and I can't believe I haven't covered that in my presentation, but it's a very good...

916
00:50:40,054 --> 00:50:46,057
So again, when I was talking about the source, obviously, you know, what you normally do is you create...

917
00:50:46,057 --> 00:50:51,880
So if I record myself screaming, for example, I would create several different variations of that.

918
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:57,586
in the first place. So then later on, and also all like modern libraries do that as well,

919
00:50:57,586 --> 00:51:01,330
they provide one sound but they also provide you know eight different variations or six variations.

920
00:51:01,330 --> 00:51:07,618
And then what I would do is as long as I get one sound to work in my in my session like an

921
00:51:07,978 --> 00:51:12,382
an attack sound for example, I would then duplicate the whole thing and try and shift

922
00:51:12,382 --> 00:51:18,248
everything so I use the next kind of variation of that. See if it works and then the whole

923
00:51:18,248 --> 00:51:23,133
game starts again. It probably doesn't work so again I would replace layers but again

924
00:51:23,133 --> 00:51:26,115
obviously because I already set some kind of style with the first variation.

925
00:51:26,716 --> 00:51:28,077
then it gets more complicated.

926
00:51:28,077 --> 00:51:30,079
But yeah, I would tend to do,

927
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:32,322
sorry, I would tend to duplicate the sounds

928
00:51:32,322 --> 00:51:35,445
and try and just to change the files itself.

929
00:51:35,445 --> 00:51:35,645
Okay.

930
00:51:35,645 --> 00:51:37,347
And then see again if it works,

931
00:51:37,347 --> 00:51:38,769
and if it doesn't work, then I have to restart.

932
00:51:38,769 --> 00:51:39,650
So is it actually the opposite?

933
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:42,873
You leave the modulation and pitching more or less the same

934
00:51:42,873 --> 00:51:43,093
and then.

935
00:51:43,313 --> 00:51:45,694
Yeah, no, I mean, obviously, you know, the pitching can vary.

936
00:51:45,694 --> 00:51:48,455
So that's in, um, oh yeah, I see what you mean.

937
00:51:48,455 --> 00:51:52,696
No, yeah, I would leave it the same because you know, most of these sounds

938
00:51:52,696 --> 00:51:56,118
would then work, but then if I play the second sound, if I play the second

939
00:51:56,118 --> 00:51:59,979
variation, the pitch is again, shifting slightly, I then go back into the

940
00:51:59,979 --> 00:52:01,839
different layers and try to match them together again.

941
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:05,040
And then for the third and fourth and fifth variation, it's exactly the same.

942
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:05,601
Awesome.

943
00:52:05,601 --> 00:52:06,461
Well, thank you very much.

944
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:16,491
Hi, so I think I know the answer to this,

945
00:52:16,491 --> 00:52:18,292
but I'm asking just in case.

946
00:52:18,292 --> 00:52:20,494
You're pitching the layers to match them

947
00:52:20,494 --> 00:52:22,135
so that they fit together, and then are you

948
00:52:22,135 --> 00:52:25,196
then doing more expressive pitching on the master bus

949
00:52:25,196 --> 00:52:26,757
to kind of pitch the whole thing up or down

950
00:52:26,757 --> 00:52:29,339
if you wanna make it more expressive?

951
00:52:29,339 --> 00:52:32,200
Yes, so I think that was, I think you're referring

952
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,762
to that example of the elastic pitch plugin.

953
00:52:35,666 --> 00:52:36,506
Yeah, it really depends.

954
00:52:36,506 --> 00:52:40,548
So as you said rightfully, I tried to pitch all the different layers together first of

955
00:52:40,548 --> 00:52:45,049
all so that harmonizes and it sounds like believable.

956
00:52:45,049 --> 00:52:48,630
And then yeah, exactly, on the master bus I could have like an elastic pitch plug-in

957
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:51,271
which affects all the layers at the same time.

958
00:52:51,271 --> 00:52:55,712
And for example, when the creature falls over I just go like that, pitch it down or pitch

959
00:52:55,712 --> 00:53:00,454
it up when it does a kind of raw sound effect to just add a bit of more like a point of

960
00:53:00,454 --> 00:53:00,794
interest to it.

961
00:53:00,794 --> 00:53:02,315
So that would happen on the master bus, yeah.

962
00:53:02,315 --> 00:53:02,475
Thanks.

963
00:53:02,475 --> 00:53:02,755
No worries.

964
00:53:10,355 --> 00:53:11,920
Anyone else?

965
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,251
Perfect, I think we're done.

966
00:53:15,251 --> 00:53:16,837
Thank you very much, guys.
