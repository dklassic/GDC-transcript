1
00:00:11,792 --> 00:00:12,212
Welcome.

2
00:00:12,453 --> 00:00:17,038
Where this session, as you see, is leveraging games in the fight to protect local cultures.

3
00:00:17,178 --> 00:00:18,219
My name is Kate Edwards.

4
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:20,321
I'm the executive director of the Global Game Jam.

5
00:00:21,003 --> 00:00:25,785
organization, and I've been around the industry for many, many years as a geographer doing

6
00:00:25,805 --> 00:00:26,725
culturalization work.

7
00:00:27,465 --> 00:00:32,067
So this topic not only dovetails very closely to my heart with Global Game Jam, but also

8
00:00:32,127 --> 00:00:34,928
with my work in the industry all these years.

9
00:00:35,988 --> 00:00:42,091
So as we get started, though, I'd like the illustrious panel, who's the real focal point

10
00:00:42,131 --> 00:00:44,211
here, to introduce themselves.

11
00:00:44,592 --> 00:00:49,273
This project was basically a combination, as you will hear, of the U.S. State Department,

12
00:00:50,054 --> 00:00:59,762
or department of state, however you want to say it, and the Global Game Jam, and of course the team who's here representing the winning team for this project.

13
00:00:59,862 --> 00:01:06,147
So, and we'll get into of course the details about what this was all about and what the whole vision for this was.

14
00:01:06,187 --> 00:01:09,570
But first let's have some introductions, if you want to start with Catherine.

15
00:01:11,231 --> 00:01:12,231
Good morning, everyone.

16
00:01:12,271 --> 00:01:13,491
Thank you so much for being here.

17
00:01:13,511 --> 00:01:14,851
I'm Catherine Foster.

18
00:01:15,532 --> 00:01:19,012
I'm the program director for the Cultural Antiquities Task

19
00:01:19,052 --> 00:01:19,432
Force.

20
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,713
I'm also the executive director of the Cultural Heritage

21
00:01:22,773 --> 00:01:24,854
Coordinating Committee at the US Department

22
00:01:24,874 --> 00:01:26,234
of State in Washington.

23
00:01:26,254 --> 00:01:28,435
Thanks, Catherine.

24
00:01:28,975 --> 00:01:29,935
And I'm Paul Fisher.

25
00:01:29,975 --> 00:01:31,955
I'm a senior program officer, also

26
00:01:31,995 --> 00:01:33,476
with the Cultural Antiquities Task Force.

27
00:01:34,036 --> 00:01:35,356
Mostly I back up Catherine.

28
00:01:35,376 --> 00:01:39,357
Oops.

29
00:01:39,417 --> 00:01:39,957
And then Victor.

30
00:01:41,524 --> 00:01:50,526
I'm Victor Bankler. I'm CEO of a small indie studio named Another Team from Sweden, together with Vania here.

31
00:01:51,366 --> 00:01:57,348
And I'm also a lecturer at the University of SkÃ¶vde where I teach game design and game development.

32
00:01:58,929 --> 00:02:03,290
I'm Vania Castagnino. I work together with the Sweden Game Arena as event coordinator.

33
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:07,271
And I'm the creative director of Another Team, so I work with Victor.

34
00:02:09,445 --> 00:02:13,607
I am Mateo Alaisa, I am from Peru, I am a lecturer in the University of Lima.

35
00:02:14,307 --> 00:02:21,711
I am also CEO with my brother in Hermanos Magia, a game development studio, and I also

36
00:02:21,751 --> 00:02:23,832
work as a game director in LibGame Studios.

37
00:02:26,674 --> 00:02:27,494
Hi, thanks for coming.

38
00:02:27,534 --> 00:02:28,695
My name is Joaquin Concha.

39
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:34,318
I am a game developer for Carpaccia, a little studio in Lima.

40
00:02:35,535 --> 00:02:42,702
Great, well thank you. So just in case people don't know what the Global Game Jam is, I feel obligated to let you know.

41
00:02:42,842 --> 00:02:49,910
So the Global Game Jam is the world's largest game creation event that happens every January or thereabouts, usually at the end of January.

42
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:57,498
It's been around since 2008. So there's been 14 editions, including during COVID, where we had to make it a virtual edition.

43
00:02:58,242 --> 00:03:02,964
But our mission statement is to empower individuals worldwide to learn, experiment, and create

44
00:03:03,004 --> 00:03:04,505
together through the medium of games.

45
00:03:04,525 --> 00:03:05,605
That's really what it's all about.

46
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:07,506
The Global Game Jam is not a competition.

47
00:03:07,626 --> 00:03:12,388
It is an educational and collaborative exercise, and we're really proud of the fact that we

48
00:03:12,428 --> 00:03:14,690
can point to many people in this industry who will

49
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:21,054
You know, basically tell us that the Global Game Jam is where they started their path on their career in the game industry.

50
00:03:21,715 --> 00:03:29,781
And so our whole mission really then is to emphasize the cultures of different of the jammers all around the world.

51
00:03:29,881 --> 00:03:34,565
I mean, just to give you a sense of the scale right before the pandemic, which was our largest event in 2020.

52
00:03:35,786 --> 00:03:43,052
We had just over 49,000 people in 118 countries at 935 live sites

53
00:03:43,592 --> 00:03:46,114
produce about 9,600 games in one weekend.

54
00:03:46,755 --> 00:03:47,916
A lot of games.

55
00:03:49,177 --> 00:03:53,260
And of course it's all around a single theme because we launch with a single theme.

56
00:03:53,601 --> 00:03:55,782
Like this year's theme for the jam was duality.

57
00:03:56,203 --> 00:03:58,765
Last year's theme was lost and found.

58
00:03:59,185 --> 00:04:02,748
And so we always create a theme that is sufficiently generic so that it can be

59
00:04:03,162 --> 00:04:06,204
You know, it can work both culturally and linguistically around the world.

60
00:04:06,804 --> 00:04:10,106
And it's just utterly fascinating to see the interpretations of all this,

61
00:04:10,126 --> 00:04:13,468
you know, from across all these different cultures and jammers,

62
00:04:13,788 --> 00:04:16,590
and to see what, you know, see what they come up with with these themes.

63
00:04:17,532 --> 00:04:22,517
So one of the things that we do in the Global Game Jam, other than the huge event that we

64
00:04:22,557 --> 00:04:27,322
do in January, we also have a smaller event in the summer called GGJ Next, which is for

65
00:04:27,862 --> 00:04:32,307
younger people, usually 12 to 18 year olds, because we obviously want to get the next

66
00:04:32,407 --> 00:04:36,311
generation coming up into the game industry, into game development.

67
00:04:36,891 --> 00:04:40,795
But we also do partner jams, which is really where the cultural heritage jam comes in.

68
00:04:41,195 --> 00:04:45,059
So throughout the rest of the year, other than January or in the summer, we try and

69
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:49,442
come up with events that are going to be interesting for our community that will engage them on

70
00:04:49,462 --> 00:04:50,183
different topics.

71
00:04:50,243 --> 00:04:54,547
Sometimes it's focused on a certain technology a company might want to try out, but then

72
00:04:54,607 --> 00:04:59,571
sometimes it might be a certain theme, which is really how our partnership with the U.S.

73
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:00,852
Department of State started.

74
00:05:01,524 --> 00:05:04,567
around this particular jam that we came up with.

75
00:05:04,728 --> 00:05:08,251
So we want to talk then about how this came about,

76
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,113
the Cultural Heritage Game Jam Initiative,

77
00:05:10,453 --> 00:05:12,395
which was this partnership that started between us

78
00:05:12,515 --> 00:05:13,657
and the U.S. Department of State.

79
00:05:13,737 --> 00:05:15,859
So do you want to describe?

80
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,141
Yeah, sure.

81
00:05:18,241 --> 00:05:21,625
I mean, maybe I'll start a little bit with background on

82
00:05:23,159 --> 00:05:29,020
Our office, the Cultural Heritage Center, in the Department of State, which has a really

83
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,981
unique mission that we conduct on behalf of the American people, and which really benefits

84
00:05:35,021 --> 00:05:36,322
people around the world.

85
00:05:37,022 --> 00:05:42,943
And we work with international partners, cultural heritage professionals, and engaged communities

86
00:05:43,023 --> 00:05:48,464
worldwide to protect and preserve cultural heritage in all its diversity.

87
00:05:49,624 --> 00:05:54,545
We foster connections between cultural heritage professionals and institutions

88
00:05:55,145 --> 00:05:56,946
and their international counterparts.

89
00:05:57,986 --> 00:06:04,287
We support preservation efforts to protect heritage from the impact of deterioration,

90
00:06:04,387 --> 00:06:09,748
natural disasters and other causes by supporting preservation projects around the world.

91
00:06:10,628 --> 00:06:15,449
And we protect heritage from theft, looting, trafficking and destruction.

92
00:06:16,128 --> 00:06:21,149
through constant collaboration with partner governments and law enforcement officials.

93
00:06:21,989 --> 00:06:28,930
And while our efforts are focused on the unique characteristics of the culturally significant

94
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:36,292
monuments and sites, as well as intangible heritage practices, this work really depends

95
00:06:36,592 --> 00:06:41,793
on partnerships and adopting technologies that can enhance our efforts.

96
00:06:43,001 --> 00:06:51,283
And, you know, in that vein, I really can't think of a better avenue to explore than game developers and this conference.

97
00:06:51,363 --> 00:07:02,845
So every year, GDC brings the international game development community together to exchange ideas, to solve problems, and really shape the future of the industry.

98
00:07:03,526 --> 00:07:05,106
And that's exactly what...

99
00:07:06,027 --> 00:07:11,250
You know, we were hoping to achieve through this first ever Cultural Heritage Game Jam

100
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:14,371
competition that happened in November of last year.

101
00:07:14,391 --> 00:07:21,575
And you know, this innovative kind of global initiative invited individuals and teams of

102
00:07:21,615 --> 00:07:25,456
gamers to exchange ideas, to ask, you know, tough questions.

103
00:07:26,037 --> 00:07:31,700
and to develop prototype games to really raise awareness of cultural heritage protection

104
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,963
among new audiences, at least new to us.

105
00:07:35,843 --> 00:07:42,027
So by expanding this circle of awareness, those of us who work to preserve cultural

106
00:07:42,067 --> 00:07:48,431
heritage, and whether that's governments or civil society or engaged individuals,

107
00:07:49,947 --> 00:07:55,650
We really gain new allies in the shared responsibility of helping communities kind of safeguard these

108
00:07:55,770 --> 00:08:00,593
artifacts, these monuments, and practices of their past.

109
00:08:01,293 --> 00:08:06,776
And I'm really proud to say that the Cultural Heritage Game Jam exceeded our expectations

110
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:07,697
greatly.

111
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:12,760
So, you know, we attracted over 850 participants from more than 70 countries around the world.

112
00:08:15,832 --> 00:08:19,067
And we're very excited about the potential of the 116 games.

113
00:08:21,527 --> 00:08:26,009
that were created for this jam, like the potential that they have to reach new audiences

114
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:31,532
and people, to spark new ideas around cultural heritage preservation,

115
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:37,855
and really to inspire action in the real world to protect and preserve cultural heritage.

116
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:42,017
So, that's a little bit of background about our work and the jam itself.

117
00:08:42,457 --> 00:08:46,319
I want to turn it over now to my colleague Paul Fisher to add a bit more

118
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:50,041
kind of context to the work that we do on the Cultural Antiquities Task Force.

119
00:08:52,623 --> 00:08:55,944
Thanks, Catherine, and thank you to all of you for showing up here today.

120
00:08:57,025 --> 00:08:58,385
I want to tell you a story.

121
00:08:59,765 --> 00:09:03,887
We're all gathered here at GDC because we're all storytellers.

122
00:09:04,867 --> 00:09:11,169
We're the collection of stories that we tell about ourselves, the myths, the epics, that

123
00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:17,010
we tell about ourselves as individuals, as organizations, as nations, and as one planet.

124
00:09:18,442 --> 00:09:24,269
Protecting these stories as they're represented in tangible cultural heritage of peoples around

125
00:09:24,289 --> 00:09:30,857
the world so that future generations can study, learn from, and be inspired by that cultural

126
00:09:30,877 --> 00:09:35,783
heritage is the work of Catherine and I's team, the Cultural Antiquities Task Force.

127
00:09:37,345 --> 00:09:41,930
The task force and our six federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security

128
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:47,094
and the Department of Justice, work to disrupt illicit trafficking of cultural heritage

129
00:09:47,134 --> 00:09:53,941
by promoting close law enforcement coordination, training, and building the capacity of foreign

130
00:09:53,961 --> 00:10:01,147
law enforcement and heritage managers to protect and preserve sites, objects, and the stories

131
00:10:01,187 --> 00:10:01,528
they tell.

132
00:10:03,448 --> 00:10:05,709
So we collaborate with partners on public education

133
00:10:05,749 --> 00:10:07,630
and outreach as crime prevention.

134
00:10:08,491 --> 00:10:11,353
This is where the game jam and all of our storytellers

135
00:10:11,433 --> 00:10:11,793
come in.

136
00:10:13,234 --> 00:10:16,456
The task force wanted to use the medium of games

137
00:10:16,576 --> 00:10:17,577
for a couple of reasons.

138
00:10:18,757 --> 00:10:21,759
To raise awareness about the threats to cultural heritage

139
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:24,981
from looting, theft, trafficking, and destruction.

140
00:10:26,382 --> 00:10:29,884
To build understanding about the importance of cultural heritage

141
00:10:30,344 --> 00:10:31,385
within communities.

142
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:39,122
to foster cross-disciplinary collaboration and dialogue around cultural heritage protection,

143
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:45,626
and to develop new and innovative tools and solutions to protect cultural heritage from

144
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:48,068
various risks, including climate change.

145
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:53,291
So the games developed for the JAM have not only inspired us.

146
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:59,305
But countless others around the world who now have a new found appreciation for

147
00:10:59,365 --> 00:11:03,928
cultural heritage, for the threats it faces from looting and trafficking, and

148
00:11:03,948 --> 00:11:09,813
the positive role that games can play in telling the stories of our past for the future.

149
00:11:11,845 --> 00:11:17,688
So now, let me tell you one particular story about the Gilgamesh Dream Tablet, which I

150
00:11:17,728 --> 00:11:23,810
hope will illuminate what it is that we do, because playing 116 video games is not our

151
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:24,470
normal fare.

152
00:11:27,272 --> 00:11:32,694
So the story of Gilgamesh, a demigod, and his dreams of adventure were inscribed into

153
00:11:32,714 --> 00:11:34,915
a clay tablet more than 3,500 years ago.

154
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:43,302
The tablet is originally from Iraq and was exported from that country without permission.

155
00:11:44,463 --> 00:11:51,465
In 2003, an antiquities dealer in the United States bought it and then created a fake ownership

156
00:11:51,565 --> 00:11:55,046
history for the tablet before selling it on.

157
00:11:56,487 --> 00:12:02,169
The tablet changed hands many times before ultimately ending up in a museum, not the

158
00:12:02,229 --> 00:12:06,510
Smithsonian, not far from where Catherine and I work in Washington, D.C.

159
00:12:08,819 --> 00:12:11,741
So this is where the Cultural Antiquities Task Force comes in.

160
00:12:13,043 --> 00:12:15,565
Since 2004, the Cultural Antiquities Task Force

161
00:12:15,945 --> 00:12:18,668
has coordinated with federal law enforcement agencies,

162
00:12:19,168 --> 00:12:23,352
foreign partners, and Interpol to disrupt the theft, looting,

163
00:12:23,733 --> 00:12:26,415
vandalism, and trafficking of cultural heritage.

164
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:35,217
Organized crime syndicates, including terrorists, steal, loot, and illegally export objects

165
00:12:35,557 --> 00:12:41,641
like the Gilgamesh Dream tablet and sell these national treasures to dealers and collectors

166
00:12:41,901 --> 00:12:42,541
around the world.

167
00:12:44,044 --> 00:12:50,566
Through pillage, objects are hastily and unscientifically removed from their archaeological context,

168
00:12:51,086 --> 00:12:57,387
sometimes destroying whole sites in the process and thus depriving us of vital information

169
00:12:57,768 --> 00:13:03,069
for understanding past societies, which then goes on to inspire all of our gamers.

170
00:13:04,729 --> 00:13:10,831
Often the trafficked objects find their way into private collections, never to be seen

171
00:13:10,891 --> 00:13:11,091
again.

172
00:13:13,301 --> 00:13:15,762
In the case of the Gilgamesh Dream Tablet, I have good news.

173
00:13:16,343 --> 00:13:19,324
In 2019, it was seized by US law enforcement.

174
00:13:19,764 --> 00:13:23,266
And last year, it finally made its long journey home

175
00:13:23,807 --> 00:13:25,728
and returned to the people of Iraq.

176
00:13:27,809 --> 00:13:29,410
So that's the Cultural Integrities Task Force.

177
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:32,231
I'm going to hand it back over to Kate, who will tell us,

178
00:13:32,251 --> 00:13:33,832
hopefully, about our judging process.

179
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:36,892
Yes, so, well I do have one question though.

180
00:13:36,932 --> 00:13:39,554
I don't know if you remember, but when we started this partnership,

181
00:13:39,574 --> 00:13:43,216
I remember in our first conversation, and they approached, you know,

182
00:13:43,236 --> 00:13:45,037
the Global Game Jam, like, let's do this.

183
00:13:45,117 --> 00:13:49,499
And I said, do you really want to partner with the industry that created Tomb Raider

184
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,522
and has Indiana Jones and things like that?

185
00:13:53,642 --> 00:13:59,325
And so I'm just curious really quick, like, what drew you to games specifically as like a medium

186
00:13:59,345 --> 00:14:02,187
to like really, you know, help with this issue?

187
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:08,213
Yeah, I mean, games, of course, are a very unique and powerful medium.

188
00:14:09,153 --> 00:14:14,437
And, you know, first and foremost, we really wanted to democratize our problem-solving.

189
00:14:14,557 --> 00:14:19,960
You know, we can do all the strategizing in the world internally with a task force,

190
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,603
but when you open that up and you allow other engaged partners to come in...

191
00:14:25,404 --> 00:14:36,684
And especially in the game dev community, you can come up with problem solving solutions that we couldn't even dream of.

192
00:14:37,882 --> 00:14:41,444
But that all of you, you know, have this unique perspective to offer.

193
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:46,427
Games also, of course, like bolster innovation.

194
00:14:46,507 --> 00:14:50,389
You know, you think of all the user-driven experiences and interfaces.

195
00:14:50,449 --> 00:14:58,353
Of course, AI, VR, AR, all of those technologies could be leveraged in our efforts

196
00:14:58,834 --> 00:15:00,495
to protect and preserve heritage.

197
00:15:02,198 --> 00:15:09,059
As Paul has already kind of alluded to, the storytelling aspect of games that all of you are aware of.

198
00:15:09,119 --> 00:15:17,501
You know, we can really convey these narratives and complex ideas in ways that are not kind of preachy,

199
00:15:17,561 --> 00:15:24,442
they're experiential for the players, you know, to kind of actually play through scenarios,

200
00:15:25,422 --> 00:15:29,863
play through histories and the lives of other people that they couldn't have.

201
00:15:30,343 --> 00:15:38,126
kind of imagined or experienced in any other way short of, you know, actually going and visiting these places and living with people.

202
00:15:38,947 --> 00:15:48,871
And it's through that real immersive experience that you can begin to kind of build mutual understanding, build that empathy for people.

203
00:15:49,861 --> 00:15:55,564
And in the terms of trafficking, I mean, so many lives are affected on the ground.

204
00:15:55,604 --> 00:16:04,429
If you think of, you know, cultural objects that are important to your ethnic or religious

205
00:16:04,529 --> 00:16:09,051
community, if something is taken away from your church, from your mosque, for example,

206
00:16:09,111 --> 00:16:15,555
synagogue, that doesn't allow you to participate in your religion anymore because those objects

207
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,175
are gone.

208
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:21,797
You can imagine how detrimental that is to your being,

209
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:26,139
your day-to-day and what your community identifies itself with.

210
00:16:26,239 --> 00:16:30,721
And so being able to tell that story and feel that emotion,

211
00:16:31,161 --> 00:16:36,564
that loss that communities have when their cultural objects

212
00:16:36,644 --> 00:16:40,986
are kind of stolen away from them is something I think that games

213
00:16:41,246 --> 00:16:42,506
are uniquely suited to.

214
00:16:43,668 --> 00:17:11,686
to build on. And then of course, just meeting people where they are. You know, you've all, you know, all know the statistics, how many gamers are out there, like that is where people are spending their time. And so, you know, we want to meet people where they are in a medium that they're comfortable with. And so games, more than movies, even, or any other medium, like kind of rise to the top for us, in terms of a space that we could really engage. And the game dev community,

215
00:17:12,307 --> 00:17:17,572
It seems to be really game, pun intended, for collaborating.

216
00:17:17,612 --> 00:17:19,874
And so, yeah, that's why we were looking to games.

217
00:17:20,274 --> 00:17:20,614
Awesome.

218
00:17:21,355 --> 00:17:24,658
Well, I'm sure people might be curious about what

219
00:17:24,938 --> 00:17:25,979
came out of the game jam.

220
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:30,023
So I'm going to show you a little highlight reel here.

221
00:19:07,233 --> 00:19:10,135
Thank you so much, everyone.

222
00:21:32,437 --> 00:21:32,758
Okay.

223
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:00,280
Yes, thank you.

224
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,200
I mean, it's amazing work, really.

225
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,141
And of course, that's just a small sample of the 116 games

226
00:22:05,181 --> 00:22:05,982
that we received.

227
00:22:06,062 --> 00:22:09,343
It's just the diversity of not only the game play, the game

228
00:22:09,423 --> 00:22:11,323
types, the cultures being represented, and the

229
00:22:11,403 --> 00:22:13,564
geographic diversity was just phenomenal.

230
00:22:13,944 --> 00:22:16,265
And I think it really surpassed all of our

231
00:22:16,545 --> 00:22:17,345
expectations.

232
00:22:18,585 --> 00:22:21,586
And to just talk a little bit about the judging process, of

233
00:22:21,646 --> 00:22:25,587
course, once we had these 116 games, the group of us between

234
00:22:25,647 --> 00:22:28,108
the US Department of State and the Global Game Jam, we

235
00:22:28,128 --> 00:22:29,268
basically had to get together.

236
00:22:29,892 --> 00:22:31,713
and judge the games very quickly.

237
00:22:32,773 --> 00:22:35,214
We had a very small window to make this happen,

238
00:22:35,254 --> 00:22:40,015
but we had our criteria that we set up, played all the games.

239
00:22:40,515 --> 00:22:41,916
We went through every single one of the games

240
00:22:42,616 --> 00:22:44,236
and had a great time doing it.

241
00:22:44,636 --> 00:22:47,117
And then we did some, there were some prizes

242
00:22:47,177 --> 00:22:49,298
attached to the games.

243
00:22:49,658 --> 00:22:51,018
So you can see here, we had like.

244
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:55,740
We had, that was the, I can't read that.

245
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,961
But the, yeah, best audio, the accessible design,

246
00:23:00,281 --> 00:23:03,142
best use of educational design principles, the best art,

247
00:23:03,302 --> 00:23:05,803
and best engaging, desiring, or most engaging design.

248
00:23:06,804 --> 00:23:09,204
So we had a lot of games that just did a fantastic job.

249
00:23:09,244 --> 00:23:12,125
It was really difficult to pick the overall winner,

250
00:23:12,285 --> 00:23:16,207
but we did eventually decide upon the overall winner,

251
00:23:16,947 --> 00:23:19,228
which was the game Purunmachu.

252
00:23:19,848 --> 00:23:20,548
Which, yes.

253
00:23:27,571 --> 00:23:34,446
So one of the great pleasures that we had as the people, you know, organizing this event was to bring the team.

254
00:23:34,936 --> 00:23:39,938
Here to GDC to talk about their work because really they are the stars of this session

255
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:42,418
and the amazing work that they did on their game.

256
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:48,120
And so what we want to do then is turn it over to the team to talk about the process

257
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,941
they went through and their engagement with this jam.

258
00:23:51,461 --> 00:23:57,263
And you tell me I can show the video of the game if you want or do you want to speak a

259
00:23:57,283 --> 00:23:57,743
little first?

260
00:23:58,284 --> 00:24:01,609
You saw a brief snippet of it in the highlights reel, but let's show you some gameplay here.

261
00:24:17,611 --> 00:24:24,574
This video is cut, so it shows three different pieces from the game.

262
00:24:24,654 --> 00:24:32,676
This is quite early, when you find one of the first artifacts in the rainforest, close to the foot of the mountain.

263
00:24:34,657 --> 00:24:36,677
That's our protagonist right there.

264
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:44,440
And we communicate through these bubbles that...

265
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:55,504
It gives us insight into her thoughts that changes throughout the game as she encounters cultural heritage.

266
00:24:56,805 --> 00:25:05,749
And I don't know if you noticed, but the prompt that appears every time you approach an object changes from take to steal.

267
00:25:05,769 --> 00:25:12,853
And that sort of reflects her own attitude towards what she's doing.

268
00:25:23,867 --> 00:25:32,134
And this is the moment when she faces the Perumatu, which is a mummy from the Chachapoya culture.

269
00:25:38,979 --> 00:25:51,169
And this is at the very end, when she's climbing the mountain to reach the actual spot of the Perumatu, where they are found.

270
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:52,310
What's the name of the mountain?

271
00:25:53,501 --> 00:26:02,488
It's where actually the Chachapoya culture will bury their death up in the mountain.

272
00:26:02,508 --> 00:26:17,940
We went that side just for you to have the view.

273
00:26:47,641 --> 00:26:50,824
So maybe I think I can start introducing a little bit of our team.

274
00:26:51,184 --> 00:26:52,605
We are actually 11 people.

275
00:26:52,625 --> 00:26:55,467
Yeah, us four.

276
00:26:55,587 --> 00:26:57,689
We actually have three more people in the audience,

277
00:26:58,249 --> 00:27:01,832
which is Pablo Carrillo, Beto AznarÃ¡n, and Gabriel Alaisa.

278
00:27:01,872 --> 00:27:02,593
I don't know if you want to...

279
00:27:03,033 --> 00:27:11,000
Yeah, we have some people that couldn't make it here.

280
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,482
In between those, Nahid, who was our fantastic programmer.

281
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:18,913
She's from Iran and she couldn't actually have the visa to come here.

282
00:27:20,594 --> 00:27:26,279
And we actually come from like two, three actually different universities, two universities

283
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:31,404
in Peru, Universidad de Lima and Universidad CatÃ³lica, which is where Gabriel works.

284
00:27:32,705 --> 00:27:37,950
And they're actually funding for six months more of Purumachu.

285
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,813
They are very excited about where we can take this game to.

286
00:27:43,109 --> 00:27:52,215
And we have the University of Cote, where Victor is a lecturer, and actually where I also studied in the series game master.

287
00:27:53,215 --> 00:28:00,440
And, for example, we also have been working with some institutions. I think Mateo knows a little more about this.

288
00:28:01,095 --> 00:28:07,678
Yeah, we have worked with many organizations from Peru that work in two different fields.

289
00:28:08,058 --> 00:28:14,482
One is the protection of the nature field and it's really important because many of the references

290
00:28:14,562 --> 00:28:20,085
of the plants we use are not just, okay, I'm going to make a generic type of jungle that many times

291
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:28,029
we see that on video games, but we try to make a unique identity of jungle. Precisely the opposite

292
00:28:28,069 --> 00:28:29,349
to the reference of Indiana Jones.

293
00:28:30,957 --> 00:28:36,522
Yeah, like Gabriel Alaisa has been working with rangers from nature parks like Manu

294
00:28:36,742 --> 00:28:38,723
and Tambopata and Matses.

295
00:28:39,344 --> 00:28:43,828
So he has like a lot of detail into what they look like.

296
00:28:43,848 --> 00:28:45,149
Into botanical knowledge.

297
00:28:45,189 --> 00:28:45,369
Yeah.

298
00:28:46,184 --> 00:28:54,371
And the other organization we have talked with, and actually is the second part of the help we are receiving but also giving,

299
00:28:54,671 --> 00:29:00,797
is with a former director of the Chachapoyos region that is in the north of Peru in the jungle region.

300
00:29:01,618 --> 00:29:04,881
And she was a former Ministry of Culture and now she runs the...

301
00:29:07,003 --> 00:29:13,388
We are going to donate the game for the whole region and for the museum too.

302
00:29:13,448 --> 00:29:25,378
She has helped us a lot with many things about information because it was really hard to get to certain things about a game touching a culture that is not as well known as many others in Peru.

303
00:29:30,698 --> 00:29:39,922
You also included some slides that show some of the inspiration between the actual cultural objects which you see on the right and then how it was represented in the game.

304
00:29:40,002 --> 00:29:46,785
Oh yeah, so this just shows, you saw this in the video before.

305
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,343
actually a textile used for wrapping the mummies,

306
00:29:53,864 --> 00:29:57,767
or it was used in the Chachapoya civilization.

307
00:29:58,268 --> 00:30:01,931
That's one of the first artifacts from a culture that you encounter.

308
00:30:03,352 --> 00:30:06,375
Here you're shamelessly treated like Indian eons would have,

309
00:30:06,575 --> 00:30:08,357
just you grab it and put it in

310
00:30:08,397 --> 00:30:11,360
your backpack before you start questioning yourself.

311
00:30:14,633 --> 00:30:19,525
Oh yeah, that's up in the mountain where actually the bodies are, well, buried.

312
00:30:24,384 --> 00:30:26,826
Those are the actual Perumachos, actually they are potteries.

313
00:30:27,406 --> 00:30:30,669
So there is a very interesting fact

314
00:30:30,729 --> 00:30:34,651
about why we chose this culture and not another one.

315
00:30:35,152 --> 00:30:37,453
Like any game that is fighting against the protection

316
00:30:37,493 --> 00:30:38,874
of any culture, it's important.

317
00:30:39,354 --> 00:30:41,776
So what's the criteria that you are going

318
00:30:41,796 --> 00:30:43,417
to use to choose which one?

319
00:30:44,018 --> 00:30:47,720
So one of the, we got two strong arguments

320
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,741
that are very different.

321
00:30:48,901 --> 00:30:53,064
In Peru, the most well-known culture is Inka culture.

322
00:30:53,904 --> 00:31:00,286
But in Chachapoya, it's a culture that there's not much information about them and not too

323
00:31:00,306 --> 00:31:02,367
many people know about this culture.

324
00:31:02,487 --> 00:31:08,289
And what is really important of this is that there are still people of that region that

325
00:31:08,369 --> 00:31:12,910
identifies with this culture, but there is not too much material that you can find about

326
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:12,990
it.

327
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:13,170
So...

328
00:31:14,131 --> 00:31:21,315
In a way, making games about ancient cultures, it's not only about talking history and the past,

329
00:31:21,415 --> 00:31:27,579
but it's also a way of rethinking the future with new symbols, with new ways of seeing them,

330
00:31:27,859 --> 00:31:38,366
and new ways of having a way of relating to something that existed and has transformed with time.

331
00:31:42,721 --> 00:31:50,369
That's again a family of mummies on the side of the Tiger Mountain.

332
00:31:50,449 --> 00:31:56,154
All these contain mummies. They are, as Matteo said, they are pottery.

333
00:31:57,075 --> 00:31:59,938
Huge. You can see the skulls on the top of their heads.

334
00:32:00,678 --> 00:32:04,562
That's a human skull, so then you realize how big they are in comparison.

335
00:32:06,002 --> 00:32:11,805
For us, what was really interesting is that many times when you talk about a culture,

336
00:32:11,925 --> 00:32:14,126
it's really hard to make people get related to it.

337
00:32:14,747 --> 00:32:19,910
So for example, at the beginning, we weren't going to do a Purimachu project when we were

338
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:21,330
just discussing what we were going to do.

339
00:32:21,811 --> 00:32:23,792
We wanted to do Inca Bridge.

340
00:32:24,392 --> 00:32:30,936
This is really interesting because this bridge is made every single year by farmers and it's made with ropes.

341
00:32:31,456 --> 00:32:42,422
But we thought it was a really important subject, but at the same time it was going to be really hard for people to relate to an object as a bridge.

342
00:32:42,642 --> 00:32:49,705
It's more abstract, especially if you're trying to make people connect to something that they are not related to,

343
00:32:49,805 --> 00:32:52,727
even more if it's a culture that is not well known.

344
00:32:53,247 --> 00:33:00,214
So for us Purunmachus had this another special argument that is literally the Purunmachu is a person.

345
00:33:00,934 --> 00:33:07,540
And even so, many for our Occidental influence, when we see maybe these drawings,

346
00:33:08,001 --> 00:33:11,344
we see a dead body and we think, oh, this is disgusting, this is horrible, no?

347
00:33:11,884 --> 00:33:15,708
But what is really interesting about the culture is that...

348
00:33:16,589 --> 00:33:20,011
Actually, these people see them as their ancestors.

349
00:33:20,691 --> 00:33:27,656
So that's a great way of transforming a conception that normally is not criticized or rethinked.

350
00:33:28,436 --> 00:33:33,620
And we thought this is a way of making a new relation to what really means to have

351
00:33:34,981 --> 00:33:40,104
ancestry and true cultural heritage to where you have come from or else.

352
00:33:43,667 --> 00:33:50,230
So we thought this was a really strong point to make a connection between our main character

353
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:53,112
and the relation that we wanted to work with him.

354
00:33:53,812 --> 00:33:58,895
Yeah, it was very important for us that the game could show something that everyone can

355
00:33:58,935 --> 00:34:03,417
relate to, especially because in our own team we didn't have only Peruvians.

356
00:34:03,437 --> 00:34:05,458
We had Swedish and Iranians.

357
00:34:05,498 --> 00:34:10,841
So it was very important that you could see what was happening in the game and relate.

358
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:19,465
Yeah, we tried to make the team one, so we chose the Bruno Macho, like an idea we can

359
00:34:19,485 --> 00:34:24,408
develop so everybody can understand what we want to make.

360
00:34:26,233 --> 00:34:28,554
I'll just clarify what we're seeing in the picture there.

361
00:34:28,655 --> 00:34:34,399
So that's the mummy and Gabriele's drawing of the mummy.

362
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,781
And then you see the smashed Puddle Macho.

363
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:43,185
It's looters that have crushed the Puddle Macho and stolen

364
00:34:43,225 --> 00:34:46,907
mummies, because those are actually subject of looting.

365
00:34:50,634 --> 00:34:55,139
I'm curious, in this process, when you went through the research, obviously you mentioned

366
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:59,263
like talking to some of the experts in the region, especially people representing that

367
00:34:59,343 --> 00:35:00,404
particular cultural group.

368
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:05,129
I'm wondering, was there anything that you learned that was like, you just had no idea,

369
00:35:05,189 --> 00:35:06,531
like very surprising to you?

370
00:35:07,491 --> 00:35:08,951
Well, actually, yeah, of course.

371
00:35:09,332 --> 00:35:13,053
Like, when you do research, things get more complex and complex.

372
00:35:13,073 --> 00:35:13,733
That's the beauty of it.

373
00:35:14,313 --> 00:35:16,874
So actually, what we knew at the beginning

374
00:35:16,954 --> 00:35:19,655
was that there was only one type of Purimachu.

375
00:35:19,675 --> 00:35:24,056
Then when I did the research, there were like seven types of Purimachus.

376
00:35:24,096 --> 00:35:29,558
And actually, the region was influenced by the Incas,

377
00:35:29,578 --> 00:35:31,239
that were an immense empire.

378
00:35:32,659 --> 00:35:42,525
Well, there were Purunmachus Incas mixed with Chachapoyas culture, also true Chachapoyas, Purunmachus.

379
00:35:43,666 --> 00:35:50,109
I learned a lot about the dangers of cultural theft because this is a very particular thing that happened.

380
00:35:50,129 --> 00:35:56,473
When I was talking with this archaeologist, she was very happy that we were doing this project, etc.

381
00:35:57,394 --> 00:36:01,436
She was already frustrated when we were doing the project and I couldn't understand why.

382
00:36:01,936 --> 00:36:09,701
And the thing is, she kept telling me stories about how everyone goes, takes pieces,

383
00:36:09,981 --> 00:36:15,745
no one respects the space where the pieces are, and this is an immense danger because...

384
00:36:15,985 --> 00:36:20,168
Cultures like this really, really, really, really,

385
00:36:20,468 --> 00:36:22,750
there are not too much information about,

386
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:26,473
and any intervention of any person that is not

387
00:36:26,513 --> 00:36:29,555
in a specialist creates enormous danger.

388
00:36:29,755 --> 00:36:31,917
So this is one of the little things I learned.

389
00:36:31,957 --> 00:36:34,319
But I learned much more, but I don't want to take the mic.

390
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:36,300
Yeah.

391
00:36:39,397 --> 00:37:03,305
And yet, well, another thing too, I'm curious, this is kind of a question for everybody. So now the game's done. Well, I mean, it's it's, I mean, it's been, you know, the, at least the first version of it's done. Where do you where do you want this to go from here? I guess I'm asking both the team, like, what do you hope to see with this particular game? And then also, in general, with this, this whole effort? Like, where do you see it going from here?

392
00:37:03,535 --> 00:37:09,361
Well, we have just a new version for the GDC now, so we are keep working on the game.

393
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:19,130
Like Mateo said, we will donate this to the museum so people can understand in another way how this could be.

394
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:27,898
So that's where we are working. We probably have like six months at least for continuing to work on this game.

395
00:37:30,773 --> 00:37:34,536
There are not too many examples of games like this in Latin America.

396
00:37:34,656 --> 00:37:39,940
This is really important because for us, trying to find funding for the project,

397
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,762
that is also extremely hard in Latin America.

398
00:37:44,083 --> 00:37:47,166
We were lucky that I and my brother were and Victor are professors.

399
00:37:48,547 --> 00:37:52,708
It helps to build a new perspective of what games can do.

400
00:37:52,788 --> 00:37:54,708
And that's why we're really grateful to be here,

401
00:37:54,769 --> 00:38:00,970
because this gives really a big horizon of how far a game that

402
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:02,931
has this type of aim can go.

403
00:38:03,791 --> 00:38:06,412
Yeah, I feel that the universities, especially in Peru,

404
00:38:06,472 --> 00:38:08,573
have been very excited about this project,

405
00:38:09,093 --> 00:38:11,533
like seeing this culture uplifted.

406
00:38:12,274 --> 00:38:14,574
And they're excited about seeing where it goes

407
00:38:14,674 --> 00:38:17,635
and what else can we teach with this type of tools.

408
00:38:17,755 --> 00:38:17,895
Yeah.

409
00:38:20,987 --> 00:38:24,531
And I want to plus up what Mateo just said a little bit ago.

410
00:38:25,252 --> 00:38:28,635
You know, for us, when we were thinking about our learning objectives,

411
00:38:29,537 --> 00:38:32,019
What Mateo just said, it brings this huge smile to my face,

412
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:34,140
and it's like the monitoring and evaluation right there.

413
00:38:34,941 --> 00:38:38,203
That he said he gained this appreciation

414
00:38:38,284 --> 00:38:40,946
for the nuance between different types of Buran Machu,

415
00:38:41,446 --> 00:38:44,889
and then also learned about these different threats

416
00:38:45,169 --> 00:38:47,331
to cultural heritage from theft, looting,

417
00:38:47,371 --> 00:38:48,492
trafficking, and destruction.

418
00:38:49,973 --> 00:38:52,635
And so that work of fostering respect

419
00:38:52,995 --> 00:38:55,337
and telling those stories through games.

420
00:38:56,793 --> 00:39:00,136
I don't know, this is exactly what we were hoping for and I'm just so overjoyed that

421
00:39:00,376 --> 00:39:01,837
you know that's what came out in the game.

422
00:39:03,458 --> 00:39:04,819
Can I ask them a question?

423
00:39:07,181 --> 00:39:13,186
So you know in the game, okay so this is how I interpreted it, that the Purimachu washed

424
00:39:13,206 --> 00:39:17,850
down from the mountains because of increased rainfall, because of climate change.

425
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:23,634
Is that how you were conceiving of the risks from climate change to cultural heritage in

426
00:39:23,654 --> 00:39:23,955
the game?

427
00:39:26,585 --> 00:39:37,590
Yeah, right. We really wanted to touch on climate change as a part of this because not all cultural heritage destruction is man-made.

428
00:39:38,531 --> 00:39:43,614
Of course, no matter the cause, we have the power to protect it still.

429
00:39:43,694 --> 00:39:47,316
So we want to touch on that as well.

430
00:39:47,536 --> 00:39:48,516
And hopefully we can...

431
00:39:50,311 --> 00:39:55,397
give a little bit more focus to it so it doesn't have to be a question in the future

432
00:39:55,417 --> 00:40:03,107
but it's clearly put some spotlight on the issue of climate change.

433
00:40:07,712 --> 00:40:24,511
Well, great. Well, I think we've got about 10 minutes or so left and I'm going to leave you with this link because the games are all up on the Cultural Heritage Game Jam site on itch.io. So I really encourage people to take a snapshot of that. Go to the link, play the games. All 116 games are there.

434
00:40:26,768 --> 00:40:27,949
including Peru and Machu.

435
00:40:28,029 --> 00:40:29,811
So we hope you go enjoy that.

436
00:40:30,312 --> 00:40:32,073
And in the meantime, while we're still here,

437
00:40:32,133 --> 00:40:35,036
if anyone has any questions for the panel here,

438
00:40:35,056 --> 00:40:37,359
I mean, please come up to the mic.

439
00:40:37,399 --> 00:40:38,460
I think there's a mic there, right?

440
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:41,003
And, you know, feel free to ask some questions.

441
00:40:52,009 --> 00:40:59,657
Hi everybody, thank you. This was a really good talk. I'm actually a local organizer for a Global Game Jam here in San Francisco.

442
00:40:59,677 --> 00:41:01,739
Yay! Global Game Jam out!

443
00:41:05,047 --> 00:41:07,988
One of my questions is like, I think that,

444
00:41:08,368 --> 00:41:10,548
or, well, okay, beginning is opinion,

445
00:41:10,588 --> 00:41:12,629
the next part is the question related to the opinion.

446
00:41:12,949 --> 00:41:14,350
One of my opinions is that like,

447
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:16,150
if more people get to make games,

448
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:18,651
we get to get more of these different perspectives

449
00:41:18,731 --> 00:41:19,911
and different cultures.

450
00:41:20,772 --> 00:41:23,132
And whenever I run game jams,

451
00:41:24,373 --> 00:41:26,673
like, it's more or less the same people

452
00:41:26,773 --> 00:41:28,834
who kind of come all the time.

453
00:41:29,562 --> 00:41:32,828
and I would like to have more different kinds of people

454
00:41:32,848 --> 00:41:34,290
aside from the usual.

455
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:35,512
It's like, yeah, the usual are great.

456
00:41:35,572 --> 00:41:37,235
They can support the new people and stuff.

457
00:41:38,818 --> 00:41:41,302
I'm not really sure how to make.

458
00:41:42,189 --> 00:41:47,432
make these kinds of things more accessible and available because a lot of the ways that

459
00:41:47,492 --> 00:41:50,494
we advertise these things, oh it's all on the internet, but a lot of people don't have

460
00:41:50,594 --> 00:41:54,677
internet or don't have good internet connection or don't even have computers or access.

461
00:41:55,117 --> 00:41:59,100
And especially if we're talking about like protecting local culture and heritage, there's

462
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:04,944
lots of people, like for example in the remote regions of the Philippines or something like

463
00:42:05,024 --> 00:42:05,244
that.

464
00:42:06,665 --> 00:42:14,088
How can we make stuff like these more accessible so they can make games and they can collaborate with us and do all these cool things?

465
00:42:14,369 --> 00:42:15,129
Thank you. That's all.

466
00:42:15,329 --> 00:42:15,689
Thank you.

467
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:21,152
I think it was a very global game jam type of question.

468
00:42:21,432 --> 00:42:25,754
Well, I'm happy to... Well, I can give you an example and I think you...

469
00:42:26,222 --> 00:42:31,885
To your question, a lot of times what we have to do is, you know, we have to be the ones

470
00:42:31,905 --> 00:42:35,587
to reach out and make that happen and help facilitate that interaction.

471
00:42:36,007 --> 00:42:40,729
So one really good example I can give you is I participated a few years ago in the Sami

472
00:42:40,769 --> 00:42:42,770
game jam up in northern Finland.

473
00:42:43,331 --> 00:42:48,333
So we were up there in Utsjoki above the Arctic Circle where the indigenous Sami people live,

474
00:42:48,894 --> 00:42:53,596
which, you know, well, they're across the whole region, Finland, Sweden, and Norway.

475
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:58,453
And what we did is we basically, there was teams of game developers who went up there,

476
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:01,696
and we spent a lot of time interacting with people from the community,

477
00:43:02,116 --> 00:43:04,398
and listening to their stories, and talking with them.

478
00:43:04,418 --> 00:43:08,541
And we also did traditional gatherings that they showed us, like, outside,

479
00:43:08,581 --> 00:43:11,483
and it was minus 40, so it was cold.

480
00:43:11,903 --> 00:43:14,325
But it was an amazing experience.

481
00:43:14,345 --> 00:43:17,427
So basically, a lot of listening, tons of listening, you know,

482
00:43:17,467 --> 00:43:20,469
facilitating that communication between the game developers.

483
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:28,132
the community and then the game jam actually was about taking their stories and basically putting that into game form.

484
00:43:28,152 --> 00:43:34,094
Basically, but with the community kind of looking over their shoulder, there were some people in the community who had the development skills,

485
00:43:34,134 --> 00:43:37,695
so they participated as well, but it was really a way to try and both...

486
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:48,343
Be there as an educational forum for game development, but also see how can the game developers be good listeners and see what if they're going to make games about other cultures, then how do they do it right?

487
00:43:48,763 --> 00:43:53,787
You know, and a lot of that comes down to like exactly what they did where you're interacting with that culture and communicating with them.

488
00:43:54,528 --> 00:43:58,891
Just like I worked on the game Never Alone, and that game was really about.

489
00:43:59,752 --> 00:44:06,004
That entire game, everything in that game, every piece of content was approved by the Inuit people.

490
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:12,155
They were basically doing the creative direction, the game development team was basically facilitating just the technical part of it.

491
00:44:12,737 --> 00:44:14,798
And to me, it's like when we want to do things like

492
00:44:14,838 --> 00:44:17,699
highlighting cultural heritage, that's really, to me,

493
00:44:17,719 --> 00:44:18,860
the way you do it.

494
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:22,641
But to get more people in those communities developing,

495
00:44:23,321 --> 00:44:25,542
that's a whole other educational outreach piece,

496
00:44:25,582 --> 00:44:27,443
which I know from Global Game Channel, that's part of why

497
00:44:27,483 --> 00:44:29,263
we exist, to try and make that happen.

498
00:44:29,323 --> 00:44:32,945
But you're right, there's a huge socioeconomic disparity

499
00:44:32,965 --> 00:44:35,486
in terms of internet access, hardware access, all these

500
00:44:35,526 --> 00:44:35,946
other things.

501
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:36,866
It's a bigger problem.

502
00:44:38,107 --> 00:44:39,547
It's sometimes harder to achieve.

503
00:44:40,948 --> 00:44:45,049
But yeah, so a lot of times there's sometimes where you actually people bring the equipment

504
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:50,132
to the community and have a longer term commitment to doing education there.

505
00:44:51,192 --> 00:44:53,433
But yeah, unfortunately that's not the norm yet.

506
00:44:54,113 --> 00:44:56,154
But I've seen good examples of it so far.

507
00:44:57,674 --> 00:44:58,435
So yes.

508
00:44:59,415 --> 00:44:59,535
Hi.

509
00:45:02,296 --> 00:45:07,398
What are your thoughts about the current state of localization tools for different languages

510
00:45:07,859 --> 00:45:09,179
and how they could be improved?

511
00:45:12,658 --> 00:45:19,963
All right. What's the state of localization tools?

512
00:45:20,123 --> 00:45:23,625
Well, my thought comes from the fact that I was looking at a lot of these games in nursing.

513
00:45:24,045 --> 00:45:24,886
A lot of them are in English.

514
00:45:26,567 --> 00:45:28,108
And I am wondering,

515
00:45:28,328 --> 00:45:29,108
I would imagine that.

516
00:45:29,761 --> 00:45:34,165
At least some of the languages aren't supported in Unicode, at least not to a sufficient extent.

517
00:45:36,007 --> 00:45:39,971
I don't know if that's a problem you ran into personally, but in terms of trying to localize

518
00:45:40,011 --> 00:45:44,515
games into the parent culture's language, what are the difficulties?

519
00:45:44,535 --> 00:45:50,200
We're going to run into that problem ourselves, because we want to localize this for...

520
00:45:51,892 --> 00:45:57,534
in a Quechua language, which is the language that is spoken in the Andes of Peru.

521
00:45:58,254 --> 00:46:03,656
And I don't think we know how to do that in a good way yet,

522
00:46:03,916 --> 00:46:09,077
but I think what we'll have to do is just find someone who can do it for us,

523
00:46:09,097 --> 00:46:14,479
who is not an official localizer, but someone who can speak Quechua well and stuff.

524
00:46:14,539 --> 00:46:19,581
And that's very inconvenient if you would like to do that in a large scale, like for an whole industry.

525
00:46:19,901 --> 00:46:20,081
Right.

526
00:46:21,201 --> 00:46:26,786
So how the state is, is in development, I guess.

527
00:46:27,266 --> 00:46:29,588
Localizing needs to be evolved.

528
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:34,552
And maybe it's hard to find incentive for that always.

529
00:46:35,213 --> 00:46:36,834
And that's why it is like this now.

530
00:46:37,035 --> 00:46:38,816
But when it comes to these sort of things,

531
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:40,818
it's very important that we do it either way.

532
00:46:42,213 --> 00:46:47,058
Yeah, and I think we will actually have that help from the organizations that we're working on.

533
00:46:47,619 --> 00:46:55,948
So maybe if you want to use some smaller language, you should reach out to some smaller organizations that are actually working with that.

534
00:46:55,968 --> 00:46:57,690
I think that's a good idea.

535
00:46:59,344 --> 00:47:00,384
Thank you.

536
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:05,086
There's also an opportunity that dawns on me about, you know, there's a lot of groups

537
00:47:05,206 --> 00:47:11,947
out there and governments who support them to document and preserve kind of dying languages

538
00:47:12,087 --> 00:47:13,688
and less well-known languages.

539
00:47:14,148 --> 00:47:19,689
So there's maybe an opportunity for games like that to kind of merge the two initiatives

540
00:47:19,769 --> 00:47:25,391
and you'll be reaching goals, you know, each other's goals by not only kind of documenting

541
00:47:25,451 --> 00:47:27,411
and preserving the language itself.

542
00:47:28,812 --> 00:47:34,235
Just, you know, as a standalone project, but also incorporating those languages into your games

543
00:47:35,016 --> 00:47:40,178
as a way to preserve and also celebrate, you know, those less well-known languages.

544
00:47:40,198 --> 00:47:42,240
So, there's definitely an opportunity there.

545
00:47:43,932 --> 00:47:50,437
I might add as well that it was very hard for us because we wanted to use...

546
00:47:51,038 --> 00:47:56,582
It would have been great if we could have used some language, like the local language, in the game already.

547
00:47:57,023 --> 00:48:03,468
But since none of us are descendants of the Tetrapod, not even me,

548
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:08,673
we decided that, for example, with the audio...

549
00:48:08,693 --> 00:48:09,713
The audio...

550
00:48:12,068 --> 00:48:19,653
The music is inspired by local medicinal music, but we decided immediately that we wouldn't

551
00:48:19,713 --> 00:48:25,577
try to represent any voices in the music as chanting often comes with this type of music,

552
00:48:25,997 --> 00:48:31,361
and if anyone of us would try to do chanting from a culture that is not ours, that would be

553
00:48:32,942 --> 00:48:40,407
problematic. So in that way we felt a little bit limited, and we had to find a way to go around

554
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:40,567
that.

555
00:48:41,079 --> 00:48:45,382
while still drawing inspiration from the culture that we were representing.

556
00:48:47,023 --> 00:48:55,389
Hi, wonderful games you guys. I was just wondering what the research process looked like for making

557
00:48:55,429 --> 00:49:00,212
this game and what kind of sources that you relied on or maybe what kind of sources were

558
00:49:00,272 --> 00:49:08,538
out there that you could find. Thank you. Well, the research is an archaeological and historical research

559
00:49:09,349 --> 00:49:18,454
And I think this is a very interesting question because many times when you hear about, okay,

560
00:49:18,494 --> 00:49:25,917
let's do a historical game or a cultural heritage game, it sounds like sometimes, okay, it has

561
00:49:25,957 --> 00:49:29,879
to be a game so it has to be fun, but also you have to fill the other person with information,

562
00:49:29,999 --> 00:49:30,160
no?

563
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:31,500
So there is a...

564
00:49:32,847 --> 00:49:38,731
There's a big challenge of the balance between how you deal with information, the person

565
00:49:38,751 --> 00:49:42,474
that is playing is really going to take, and how he's going to take it.

566
00:49:43,075 --> 00:49:47,098
Like for example, if I put all of the names of the plants, probably no one is going to

567
00:49:47,138 --> 00:49:47,678
remember them.

568
00:49:48,278 --> 00:49:48,439
No?

569
00:49:50,599 --> 00:49:52,679
Even more so for a game like this, no?

570
00:49:53,800 --> 00:50:01,961
So in those terms, we really thought that we really had to make all the investigation and that research

571
00:50:02,441 --> 00:50:09,103
in order to put these elements in the game, just to give you a glimpse and a feeling that you were really seeing something that is different.

572
00:50:09,463 --> 00:50:15,924
Not only because you have an artist that does a different art style, but also because it truly comes from a different reference.

573
00:50:16,444 --> 00:50:20,686
The jungle of India is not the same as the one from Peru and the one from Brazil and

574
00:50:20,766 --> 00:50:21,486
etc. etc.

575
00:50:21,686 --> 00:50:21,846
No?

576
00:50:22,246 --> 00:50:27,968
So this is a very big element in the concept and our department.

577
00:50:28,808 --> 00:50:33,450
And this is related to another idea that is really strong for us.

578
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:40,994
and in the game of course, that it's trying to think about how do you deliver a message to a player?

579
00:50:41,495 --> 00:50:44,576
Because we come here and we explain the project, no?

580
00:50:44,596 --> 00:50:52,501
But how does a game that is dealing with cultural heritage giving you a message that is not a moral message, for example?

581
00:50:52,941 --> 00:50:55,923
Let's say, okay, it's bad for you to steal pieces.

582
00:50:56,363 --> 00:51:00,145
It's really easy for anyone to make a game that gives you these limitations.

583
00:51:00,626 --> 00:51:02,106
But the hard thing is...

584
00:51:02,607 --> 00:51:06,108
How do you make the person feel a true connection to this idea?

585
00:51:06,888 --> 00:51:10,509
So we aimed for the artistical one.

586
00:51:11,529 --> 00:51:18,651
And for us, the game is about a person that is actually trying to save the pieces

587
00:51:18,711 --> 00:51:25,153
at the beginning of the exploration in the map, and then he wants to take them.

588
00:51:25,734 --> 00:51:30,055
The investigation told us the Purunmachus are in the mountains.

589
00:51:30,495 --> 00:51:31,175
So that's a fact.

590
00:51:31,955 --> 00:51:38,400
But in the sense of the message, and more in a metaphorical way even, that I think it's

591
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:44,204
always interesting to have as an extra layer in games, what you're doing is the process

592
00:51:44,244 --> 00:51:46,666
of stealing and then realizing that you have done wrong.

593
00:51:47,226 --> 00:51:54,551
So going up to the mountain is in a way the element of investigation, but also a metaphorical

594
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:55,852
sense of you have done wrong.

595
00:51:55,872 --> 00:51:56,253
You have to...

596
00:51:57,478 --> 00:51:59,222
Yeah, you have to do retribution.

597
00:51:59,983 --> 00:52:03,110
No one is telling you, you're just doing this as an act.

598
00:52:03,511 --> 00:52:03,992
So I think...

599
00:52:05,328 --> 00:52:08,509
Investigation comes, the true balance of investigation,

600
00:52:08,549 --> 00:52:10,789
because you can die in a pool of information,

601
00:52:11,249 --> 00:52:15,110
is what you choose in order to make a true meaning.

602
00:52:15,810 --> 00:52:18,351
And how can that meaning be a metaphor

603
00:52:19,131 --> 00:52:22,032
that accompanies the mechanics, the narrative,

604
00:52:22,112 --> 00:52:25,212
that are more like the structural, more direct part

605
00:52:25,272 --> 00:52:30,394
that many players are used to feel and know.

606
00:52:30,934 --> 00:52:33,514
So we think that that element sometimes

607
00:52:33,694 --> 00:52:34,435
flips like a.

608
00:52:35,895 --> 00:52:42,499
a postman's card from under your door.

609
00:52:43,399 --> 00:52:48,142
And we think that really, really helps to make that extra element of

610
00:52:48,742 --> 00:52:51,624
maybe you didn't learn a lot about Chechapoya's culture,

611
00:52:51,664 --> 00:52:54,786
but you get a feeling of, oh, this is important.

612
00:52:55,386 --> 00:52:59,989
And that's the first piece of sound that really, we think, lets games change.

613
00:53:04,539 --> 00:53:11,262
Hi, so I was wondering if there were any people that you talked to in your research that gave you

614
00:53:11,422 --> 00:53:16,643
information that made you decide you needed to change something fundamental about your game. I

615
00:53:17,544 --> 00:53:22,305
noticed you talking about the archaeologist who was expressing frustration with the fact that

616
00:53:22,346 --> 00:53:25,847
people were just going out and damaging these sites who didn't know what they were doing.

617
00:53:26,467 --> 00:53:30,949
I really appreciated the change from take to steal because it's something people don't think about,

618
00:53:31,009 --> 00:53:32,069
especially in how these

619
00:53:33,327 --> 00:53:47,393
A collection of artifacts is represented in most games, so I was just wondering if there was something that came up in your research, be it with archaeologists or locals who were familiar with the culture that made you decide to change a fundamental direction of some aspect of your game.

620
00:53:49,413 --> 00:53:52,595
No, it didn't happen that.

621
00:53:53,395 --> 00:53:56,617
But when we talked with the archaeologist,

622
00:53:56,837 --> 00:53:58,898
she was really worried about making a game that,

623
00:53:59,338 --> 00:54:01,880
in one moment, the player is stealing.

624
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:06,923
But the challenge is, you have to give that freedom,

625
00:54:06,963 --> 00:54:10,084
for us, it was, you have to give that freedom to the player

626
00:54:10,525 --> 00:54:13,066
in order to realize the damage that that means, no?

627
00:54:13,586 --> 00:54:16,008
Also, many people that have the information

628
00:54:16,028 --> 00:54:16,768
you need for a game,

629
00:54:17,969 --> 00:54:20,932
They don't know about video games and the power that they have.

630
00:54:20,992 --> 00:54:23,174
So it's a really delicate balance.

631
00:54:23,474 --> 00:54:26,697
And depending on the context you are in, that gets stronger.

632
00:54:28,238 --> 00:54:35,605
So in Peru, many people sadly see video games still as something that are only entertainment.

633
00:54:36,145 --> 00:54:38,928
But no, we didn't get any of those challenges.

634
00:54:41,385 --> 00:54:49,307
Hi, this has been really great. I was wondering if there was any suggestions or ways for people to get involved with making more games like this happen,

635
00:54:49,427 --> 00:54:57,209
and more just like, yeah, or organizations that I can contribute to directly or indirectly to make this happen more, I guess.

636
00:54:59,470 --> 00:55:06,772
Yeah, I guess, what was the question? How to engage in making these type of games? Like, what context?

637
00:55:08,224 --> 00:55:18,831
That way, or also just existing organizations that I could help to, so that we could get more developers out there who can tell their unique stories of their cultures or that kind of thing.

638
00:55:19,312 --> 00:55:22,134
If I personally can't facilitate that.

639
00:55:23,995 --> 00:55:27,817
I guess Games4Change would be a nice forum for that.

640
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:35,743
You can also come to Sweden and study my program, Serious Games Development, at the University.

641
00:55:40,261 --> 00:55:42,762
In the context of Peru, there are no organizations.

642
00:55:42,942 --> 00:55:44,282
But that's also interesting.

643
00:55:44,763 --> 00:55:47,023
Because what happens if you have that interest

644
00:55:47,123 --> 00:55:48,164
and you don't find them?

645
00:55:48,884 --> 00:55:50,404
Someone has to take charge of it.

646
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:53,625
Maybe you're not going to be the best.

647
00:55:53,945 --> 00:55:55,786
Maybe you're not going to be Games for a Change.

648
00:55:56,306 --> 00:55:58,067
But you're going to learn in the process.

649
00:55:58,167 --> 00:56:00,768
That's one of the richness of those empty spaces,

650
00:56:01,308 --> 00:56:05,189
that someone can take that crown and fight for it.

651
00:56:05,389 --> 00:56:05,549
No?

652
00:56:05,889 --> 00:56:06,910
So that's what we're trying to do.

653
00:56:07,275 --> 00:56:09,396
Maybe it's you.

654
00:56:09,456 --> 00:56:09,896
It's you.

655
00:56:10,437 --> 00:56:11,377
You are the chosen one.

656
00:56:12,918 --> 00:56:20,181
Yeah, we certainly hoped that one outcome of the game jam was to inspire others to do

657
00:56:20,281 --> 00:56:26,043
similar cultural heritage game jams, you know, other organizers, whether it be, you know,

658
00:56:26,084 --> 00:56:26,724
on the local.

659
00:56:27,484 --> 00:56:29,845
country level or regional level.

660
00:56:31,106 --> 00:56:35,408
We certainly, we the U.S. government, certainly could not have done this alone.

661
00:56:35,468 --> 00:56:39,550
Like it certainly took working with a trusted partner

662
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:43,872
like the Global Game Jam in order to make it happen.

663
00:56:44,012 --> 00:56:48,354
So there's definitely room for more kind of public,

664
00:56:48,414 --> 00:56:51,456
private partnerships and collaboration or.

665
00:56:52,757 --> 00:57:00,441
You know, motivated people in the dev community who like to organize these jams to go out,

666
00:57:00,501 --> 00:57:06,504
you know, go forth and have your own cultural heritage game jams, you know, in the future.

667
00:57:08,012 --> 00:57:12,855
And just one thing I would add to that is that I think, you know, based on the comments,

668
00:57:13,015 --> 00:57:17,337
building on those comments is that, you know, all it was really was just picking the theme.

669
00:57:17,598 --> 00:57:21,660
You know, because like every global game jam has a theme and every jam that we do,

670
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:24,602
whether it's a partner event or the January event, it has a theme.

671
00:57:25,122 --> 00:57:28,384
And most jams that I know of today, they do this similar now, you know,

672
00:57:28,404 --> 00:57:30,626
whether it's at a school or a company or whatever.

673
00:57:31,226 --> 00:57:38,935
And so all it really has to start with is having the will to say, you know what, this jam is going to be about representing our cultural heritage.

674
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:42,800
So that's what the theme is going to be this year, or this month, or whatever it is.

675
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:45,843
Because I know some organizations, especially schools, tend to jam a lot.

676
00:57:47,084 --> 00:57:52,247
But all around the world, that's one of the things I'm hoping, and I think it's probably logical that it would start at universities,

677
00:57:52,647 --> 00:58:00,992
is that, hey, make a jam, make a game about your cultural heritage, either your personal heritage or generally of the region that you're in.

678
00:58:01,032 --> 00:58:05,694
And I think that's really all it takes to kind of get that moving in that direction.

679
00:58:05,734 --> 00:58:10,977
And we just haven't seen that happen very much because a lot of jams just kind of pick, sort of like the Global Game Jam,

680
00:58:10,997 --> 00:58:15,439
we pick a generic theme, but we do that because our jam is across so many cultures.

681
00:58:16,449 --> 00:58:19,591
So, and I think with that we're done.

682
00:58:19,991 --> 00:58:21,612
So thank you.

683
00:58:21,772 --> 00:58:22,973
So thank you for coming.

684
00:58:22,993 --> 00:58:24,054
Yeah, thank you for coming.

685
00:58:24,074 --> 00:58:24,374
Thank you.

686
00:58:24,414 --> 00:58:30,077
Thank you.

687
00:58:30,137 --> 00:58:31,418
Thank you.

688
00:58:31,438 --> 00:58:31,859
Thank you.

689
00:58:31,939 --> 00:58:32,699
Thank you.
