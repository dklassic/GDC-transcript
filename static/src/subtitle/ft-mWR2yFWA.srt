1
00:00:07,336 --> 00:00:10,019
And we're back for day three.

2
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:11,000
Day three.

3
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:15,404
Three of GDC Podcast Live.

4
00:00:16,184 --> 00:00:19,988
I am your co-host Chris Graft, editor-in-chief of Gamasutra.

5
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:21,009
I'm here with...

6
00:00:22,053 --> 00:00:26,276
Fellow co-host, news editor, and associate publisher at Gamasutra, Alyssa Macklin.

7
00:00:26,296 --> 00:00:26,696
Hello.

8
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:33,080
Hey, so why does it feel like, you know, this is a virtual event, you know, and it's

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,121
the last day.

10
00:00:34,742 --> 00:00:41,486
Why does it feel like we were just at physical GDC for five days, staying up until

11
00:00:41,866 --> 00:00:42,286
3 a.m.

12
00:00:42,607 --> 00:00:43,467
and drinking?

13
00:00:43,963 --> 00:00:47,925
Yeah, like my energy level is about the same as it would be on like a final day of GDC,

14
00:00:48,226 --> 00:00:52,028
but like my legs feel a lot better because I'm not like running up and down escalators.

15
00:00:52,048 --> 00:00:53,268
So notable improvement there.

16
00:00:53,288 --> 00:00:57,290
Yeah, yeah. My legs are my legs are doing OK.

17
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:58,791
All things considered.

18
00:00:58,811 --> 00:01:00,712
Stay out of my yearly workout, though.

19
00:01:00,792 --> 00:01:02,333
So yeah, yeah.

20
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:05,654
I didn't get too many steps in during the virtual.

21
00:01:05,995 --> 00:01:07,835
But what do you think?

22
00:01:08,116 --> 00:01:09,816
I mean, I really like it.

23
00:01:11,203 --> 00:01:16,807
Yeah, no, it's great. It's been a great event as someone who writes talk coverage, the ability

24
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:21,131
to watch an on-demand talk right away or like within 15 minutes is just like, I'm not going

25
00:01:21,151 --> 00:01:25,174
to be able to come back from this. It's I'm spoiled. It's too good, which is something

26
00:01:25,274 --> 00:01:28,277
that more people should be talking about. If there was a talk you liked earlier on,

27
00:01:28,317 --> 00:01:31,920
you can go back and just watch it on demand. Or if you missed it, you can watch it on demand.

28
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:35,863
It's great. It's amazing. Yeah, we are completely unrestrained by physical

29
00:01:35,923 --> 00:01:36,523
boundaries now.

30
00:01:37,842 --> 00:01:38,783
We have transcended.

31
00:01:40,285 --> 00:01:41,006
That is right.

32
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:43,789
So I am hello everybody in chat.

33
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:45,491
Uh, thanks for joining us.

34
00:01:46,192 --> 00:01:51,117
Uh, we have a really great guest, uh, that I can't wait to get on.

35
00:01:51,198 --> 00:01:52,399
So I'm not gonna wait.

36
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,363
Uh, except I'm going to make you wait because I want to do this intro.

37
00:01:57,265 --> 00:01:57,325
Uh,

38
00:01:58,655 --> 00:02:05,558
She co-founded the highly influential web-based gaming site and publisher Congregate with her

39
00:02:05,578 --> 00:02:12,640
brother in 2006 and sold it to GameStop, as one does. She's a free-to-play games expert.

40
00:02:13,781 --> 00:02:17,162
She's an International Game Developers Association board member.

41
00:02:18,483 --> 00:02:25,607
Former and current GDC speaker whose talk should be available for free like right now on the platform.

42
00:02:26,608 --> 00:02:33,172
Founder of the newly minted Double Loop Games and according to her Twitter profile

43
00:02:33,712 --> 00:02:40,836
is a figure skater and according to her just because like I'm gonna be the judge here

44
00:02:40,876 --> 00:02:47,500
she's just a fun person to hang out with so let's welcome Emily Greer. Hey Emily.

45
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,541
Hello.

46
00:02:49,161 --> 00:02:49,682
Hello!

47
00:02:49,922 --> 00:02:50,142
Yes.

48
00:02:52,104 --> 00:02:53,986
I hung out with you Chris, it was fun.

49
00:02:55,307 --> 00:02:58,370
Thanks so much for joining us, really appreciate it.

50
00:02:58,751 --> 00:03:02,214
And great talk by the way, which we will get into.

51
00:03:02,675 --> 00:03:03,596
Thank you very much.

52
00:03:04,336 --> 00:03:09,441
As an aside, we've now had a pilot and a figure skater on the podcast, right?

53
00:03:09,501 --> 00:03:10,823
Do we have Skydiver or was it pilot?

54
00:03:12,147 --> 00:03:16,848
David Gardner? Yeah, David Gardner flies planes, does not jump out of them.

55
00:03:17,128 --> 00:03:19,489
Okay. As far as I know, he didn't bring them up.

56
00:03:20,009 --> 00:03:22,029
So interesting athletic copies you're fitting right in.

57
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:27,251
Yes. I hope that whoever is the pilot is a better pilot than I am a figure skater.

58
00:03:27,571 --> 00:03:33,492
I have more love than capabilities, which is not a good thing when you're a pilot,

59
00:03:33,532 --> 00:03:36,313
but it's just fine when you're a figure skater. It's the part that counts.

60
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:39,124
Yeah, but airplanes have wings.

61
00:03:39,184 --> 00:03:41,404
They can kind of coast if the engine dies.

62
00:03:41,504 --> 00:03:42,945
Figure skater just fall on...

63
00:03:43,665 --> 00:03:44,445
I know what I'm talking about.

64
00:03:44,465 --> 00:03:45,125
You slide.

65
00:03:45,185 --> 00:03:46,966
That's the thing that people don't under appreciate.

66
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:49,507
It actually hurts so much less to fall on ice

67
00:03:49,547 --> 00:03:50,267
than on pavement.

68
00:03:50,607 --> 00:03:53,848
I look at skateboarders and I'm like, how can you do it?

69
00:03:55,288 --> 00:03:57,869
With a figure skater, you just like slide 10 feet

70
00:03:57,929 --> 00:03:58,649
and it's not that bad.

71
00:03:58,789 --> 00:03:59,930
It truly is not that bad.

72
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,170
That sounds painful.

73
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:04,371
Thank everyone for joining us for the ice skating.

74
00:04:05,444 --> 00:04:11,069
I feel like there's a game dev metaphor there, but I'm not gonna go down that whole rabbit hole.

75
00:04:11,429 --> 00:04:14,633
Yeah, sliding on your butt on ice is not that bad.

76
00:04:15,614 --> 00:04:22,060
So, okay, Emily, anyway, can you tell us a little bit about your story and history in games?

77
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,923
How did you become involved in the game industry?

78
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,608
I came in a kind of a weird way.

79
00:04:28,628 --> 00:04:31,089
I think actually that's true of a lot of people,

80
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:32,790
but I think mine was particularly weird.

81
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:36,873
I had a 10-year career in catalogs and e-commerce

82
00:04:36,953 --> 00:04:41,216
doing what would now be called data science and UA,

83
00:04:41,316 --> 00:04:42,736
but it was called direct marketing then.

84
00:04:43,397 --> 00:04:45,158
And then my brother, who'd been in the game industry

85
00:04:45,198 --> 00:04:48,080
since he dropped out of college to work on Ultima VII,

86
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,361
had the idea to start Kongregate.

87
00:04:50,661 --> 00:04:52,943
And I started helping him with his business plan

88
00:04:53,143 --> 00:04:54,584
and thought this is a good idea.

89
00:04:55,108 --> 00:04:59,631
This is going to be a lot more fun than mailing the next million catalogs to somebody.

90
00:05:00,852 --> 00:05:06,476
Let's why don't I work in games instead of cutting down trees and volunteer to his co-founder?

91
00:05:06,496 --> 00:05:09,258
So that was my first entry into games.

92
00:05:09,318 --> 00:05:15,682
And I played games all along, but I, you know, I'm not I don't have that core gamer

93
00:05:15,743 --> 00:05:20,346
identity that most people in the industry have, which is, I think, something that is.

94
00:05:20,902 --> 00:05:25,145
Unusual about me, but also I think has been a strength through the career.

95
00:05:25,205 --> 00:05:29,167
So yeah, we built, as you talked about, we built up Congregate as the web platform.

96
00:05:29,888 --> 00:05:34,951
After we sold the GameStop, I ended up taking over as CEO, living out, you know,

97
00:05:35,071 --> 00:05:40,374
every younger sibling's fantasy of like toppling their brother, you know, off the throne.

98
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:46,838
And then we built a mobile publishing business and published things like Adventure Capitalist

99
00:05:46,878 --> 00:05:47,918
and Animation Throwdown.

100
00:05:48,513 --> 00:05:57,802
And then, you know, after 13 years, I'd been in the game industry and I'd done platform and I'd done publishing, but I'd never actually made games.

101
00:05:58,603 --> 00:06:00,525
And I really wanted to make games.

102
00:06:00,585 --> 00:06:12,157
So I ended up leaving Kongregate last year, took a little time off and then co-founded a studio with my friend Shelby Molodina called Double Loop Games, making games for mobile.

103
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:19,810
Very awesome. I mean, like, Kongregate, like, hugely, hugely influential, like, of course.

104
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:26,854
So we can, we can get back to that in a little bit, but since we don't have unlimited time with

105
00:06:26,914 --> 00:06:34,038
you, I want to talk about your, we want to talk about your session that you gave about workplace

106
00:06:35,679 --> 00:06:42,322
Trust and team building and really anti-harassment steps that you can take. Can you tell us a little

107
00:06:42,362 --> 00:06:49,607
bit about the talk for those who weren't able to attend? Yeah, you know, we've, over the last few

108
00:06:49,647 --> 00:06:55,210
years, there's been kind of wave after wave, maybe about every six months, of stories coming out from

109
00:06:55,250 --> 00:07:00,633
different companies and really all over the industry of different MeToo stories and different

110
00:07:00,673 --> 00:07:02,294
harassment stories. And

111
00:07:03,453 --> 00:07:09,834
I, you know, I had every time one of those came out, I was feeling I would feel really depressed and sort of hopeless.

112
00:07:10,435 --> 00:07:24,458
And then I started thinking about, you know, all the things that we did at Congregate to make things better and to make employees feel safe and make it a place where we could stop harassment.

113
00:07:25,198 --> 00:07:29,099
And I was like, actually, that's probably useful advice for everybody.

114
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:31,180
So I wanted to put together a talk that.

115
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:37,496
Really gives a bigger picture of the problem of abuse and harassment, you know, why it happens,

116
00:07:37,856 --> 00:07:44,939
why it's really damaging to the company more than people realize. And just really practical,

117
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:50,861
pragmatic things you can do just to make the everyday experience of your employees better,

118
00:07:51,161 --> 00:07:57,824
but also to prevent abuse and harassment. So that was sort of the genesis of this talk. And yeah.

119
00:07:59,042 --> 00:08:05,507
It's good. And it also draws on some of my own experiences in the game industry with harassment.

120
00:08:05,547 --> 00:08:09,690
That's the crazy thing is even though I've only ever been a founder in my own company,

121
00:08:10,051 --> 00:08:15,875
I still actually had, you know, multiple cases of, you know, gender and sexual harassment that

122
00:08:15,915 --> 00:08:21,940
I've experienced. So that combination of being both a leader and, you know, survivor of it,

123
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:25,482
I think is a kind of a gave me a great lens to talk about it.

124
00:08:27,614 --> 00:08:48,510
And I know the people who watch it really appreciate, you know, you coming forward about those things because those are those incidents that happen because I know that's, you know, difficult to talk about, but it does make people feel not alone, you know, so we all appreciate that.

125
00:08:50,412 --> 00:08:59,258
I know with, you said that you built this based on, or your talk was kind of built around your own experiences and kind of things that you've come to realize from your own time in the industry.

126
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:12,348
Why do you, why do you think that like other companies have maybe not been able to come to the same realizations on their own? Is there just missing conversations or just the company buildup or what's the common factor there?

127
00:09:12,368 --> 00:09:15,730
You know, when you're, when you're running a company,

128
00:09:16,407 --> 00:09:33,479
There is so much day to day just to survive and to build and deal with immediate crises, it's hard to take that step back and really think about how the system is working more broadly. Well, I did come a lot of it from my own experiences and things that

129
00:09:35,012 --> 00:09:39,174
That we've done at Congregate, a lot of that was reacting to my own experience. And again,

130
00:09:39,194 --> 00:09:42,815
the fact that I had experienced it, I think made it easier for me as a leader

131
00:09:43,155 --> 00:09:48,498
to intuit what would make, what kind of steps would make it better for employees.

132
00:09:48,858 --> 00:09:53,119
There's also a lot that I talk about that really doesn't have to do with abuse management. It's

133
00:09:53,159 --> 00:10:00,422
just good practices from team building. I talk about Google and their research on psychological

134
00:10:00,462 --> 00:10:04,424
safety and how it makes more effective teams, the game's outcomes, projects we do.

135
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:09,252
You guys at Gamasutra had a great series of blog posts and was a GDC talk.

136
00:10:09,552 --> 00:10:10,433
They've also looked at it.

137
00:10:10,553 --> 00:10:14,255
So some of these things are people are already figuring out.

138
00:10:14,275 --> 00:10:18,758
They're just not necessarily connecting it to the abuse and harassment.

139
00:10:19,138 --> 00:10:21,900
The other thing is, is that I did rely a lot on research.

140
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:28,904
I had when I decided to do this talk, I took time over actually probably about six

141
00:10:28,984 --> 00:10:31,725
months reading as much literature as I could.

142
00:10:32,615 --> 00:10:39,557
I got my professor mother to download all sorts of academic articles for me off of JSTOR.

143
00:10:39,757 --> 00:10:44,879
I didn't link to any of them because they're not freely available, but they were helpful for me in

144
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:52,181
terms of understanding it more broadly. And in particular, there was a US EEOC, the Equal

145
00:10:52,561 --> 00:10:57,842
Employment Opportunity Commission, did a study in 2016, which is just a wealth of knowledge

146
00:10:57,882 --> 00:11:00,143
and information, and I linked to that on Twitter.

147
00:11:00,808 --> 00:11:07,633
And from the talk and that that was a real really big big help to sort of get my brain around it.

148
00:11:08,253 --> 00:11:11,416
Those wider kind of academic articles for other industries and for just like

149
00:11:11,756 --> 00:11:15,279
employment as a whole do those have a lot of parallels with game development or is it

150
00:11:15,439 --> 00:11:20,243
quite different? For the most part it's really similar. Now there's some situations where they

151
00:11:20,623 --> 00:11:28,769
where they talk about you know domestic domestic workers or you know satellite retail stores which

152
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:29,030
are

153
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:32,211
You know, relevant to something like GameStop, but not,

154
00:11:33,011 --> 00:11:36,072
it's rare to have sort of two or three person little pods

155
00:11:36,132 --> 00:11:39,193
that are remote in game industry.

156
00:11:39,233 --> 00:11:41,253
So some of that stuff is specific to them.

157
00:11:41,293 --> 00:11:43,634
Some of that stuff is specific to manufacturing.

158
00:11:44,134 --> 00:11:47,815
But because the core of the problem comes back

159
00:11:47,975 --> 00:11:52,096
to humans' desire for power

160
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:58,297
and desire to push people down to raise themselves up,

161
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:05,942
That's just incredibly universal. And so it doesn't matter whether you're looking at high

162
00:12:05,982 --> 00:12:13,346
fashion or movies or games or a retail store, a lot of the same themes keep coming out.

163
00:12:15,127 --> 00:12:19,189
The way that you talked about the power dynamic was really interesting to me.

164
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:27,893
You say that we have some misconceptions of what drives harassment. Can you explain that?

165
00:12:28,863 --> 00:12:38,889
Yeah, so especially when you're talking about Me Too, you, and all the stories, a lot of the stories involve kind of sort of lurid sexual type of stuff.

166
00:12:38,909 --> 00:12:44,713
And it's very easy to think that's about sex and about people being driven by sex and wanting sex.

167
00:12:45,133 --> 00:12:48,456
Because, you know, again, that's a universal thing that we feel.

168
00:12:49,176 --> 00:12:57,902
But the more that you look at individual stories and you look at the individual patterns, sex is almost a symptom rather than the cause.

169
00:12:58,142 --> 00:12:58,502
It is.

170
00:12:59,981 --> 00:13:06,223
A, about that feeling of power that you have when you force somebody into something,

171
00:13:06,663 --> 00:13:12,244
when you put them on their feet, when you control them. And so with women,

172
00:13:13,784 --> 00:13:21,806
when it's male to female in particular, it's nearly always power, sort of oppression and power

173
00:13:21,846 --> 00:13:27,448
dynamics. When you're trying to push somebody down, you use sexual language. It seems to be very common.

174
00:13:28,481 --> 00:13:31,304
Men to men, it will often happen as well.

175
00:13:31,364 --> 00:13:36,328
And then it tends to be, you know, like homophobic slurs and other other types of things,

176
00:13:36,548 --> 00:13:41,933
but also pushing men into, you know, female gender as a way to push them down.

177
00:13:41,953 --> 00:13:44,895
And then it gets into all sorts of other things.

178
00:13:44,935 --> 00:13:54,604
So sex and sexual language is often just a just a way similar behavior is expressed.

179
00:13:54,972 --> 00:14:01,236
I'm trying to keep this clean because it's a podcast.

180
00:14:02,417 --> 00:14:09,502
When male to male, it might be, you know, you're a total fucking idiot, right? And, you know,

181
00:14:09,522 --> 00:14:17,627
homophobic slurs, niggers, and then with women, it's about sex. But it is always about you're

182
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:21,830
less than me. I'm making myself bigger in relation.

183
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:31,273
So I also want to ask about this whole theory of one bad apple, which you talked about.

184
00:14:32,574 --> 00:14:37,616
And, you know, people say, oh, the bad apples are gone now. You see it happening in companies now.

185
00:14:37,696 --> 00:14:42,479
There's a little tiny bit of a culling of like people who've been caught.

186
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:48,802
But what's your, what are your thoughts on the one bad apple idea?

187
00:14:48,822 --> 00:14:52,063
Yeah. One is that.

188
00:14:53,336 --> 00:15:03,279
It can't be just one bad apple if we're seeing it in so many companies of so many different sizes and so many different regions. It's coming up again and again.

189
00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:13,541
It's you know, the actual analogy for one bad apple is that one bad apple spoils the whole whole bunch. It's actually about.

190
00:15:15,538 --> 00:15:18,840
One poisonous thing making everything around it worse.

191
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,341
And that's actually a better analogy.

192
00:15:20,381 --> 00:15:23,543
If you think about it, that is much more what is going on.

193
00:15:24,243 --> 00:15:29,026
The other thing is, you know, there's a lot of denial about it.

194
00:15:29,287 --> 00:15:36,471
You know, when Me Too really broke in 2017, I think a lot of people were

195
00:15:37,092 --> 00:15:42,115
surprised at how really common these kinds of experiences were.

196
00:15:42,135 --> 00:15:42,195
And.

197
00:15:44,112 --> 00:15:47,154
We've been pushing things kind of under the surface for a while.

198
00:15:47,734 --> 00:15:52,578
And so the, um, there's a desire.

199
00:15:52,598 --> 00:15:57,882
And part of that is that there's a real desire for things to be okay, for things

200
00:15:57,922 --> 00:16:03,086
to not be a problem and to not have to think, you know, bad things about your

201
00:16:03,126 --> 00:16:05,187
coworker or bad things about your friend.

202
00:16:05,728 --> 00:16:10,171
It's also much easier just to blame, to put things all in one individual than

203
00:16:10,271 --> 00:16:10,791
think about.

204
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:16,083
systemic problems and how things interact. And one of the things I talk about in my talk is that

205
00:16:16,563 --> 00:16:23,308
you know harassment isn't binary where you know it happens or it hasn't happened, it's illegal or

206
00:16:23,368 --> 00:16:30,194
it isn't illegal. There's a whole spectrum of behavior that starts with like you know mean

207
00:16:30,254 --> 00:16:31,295
trash talking that

208
00:16:33,546 --> 00:16:44,268
Is it, you know, nobody would ever consider illegal, but is sort of the beginning of that kind of, you know, abusive talk.

209
00:16:44,348 --> 00:16:51,529
And then you can, you know, get to, you know, people giving each other ball taps and other things like that before you get to harassment.

210
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,650
And that's the other problem.

211
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:59,671
When you, when you say something is one bad apple, you can just, it's just this easy problem.

212
00:16:59,711 --> 00:17:01,952
You get rid of them, you find them, it's over.

213
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:14,495
But when you really look at it, and it's this whole spectrum of behavior, and a lot of people have behaved that way to some degree, then it's just much harder to deal with.

214
00:17:14,955 --> 00:17:23,319
And that's one of the things where I think it's really important to understand is that we all live up or down to our environment and surroundings to some degree.

215
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:30,782
Nobody's a saint. Nobody is completely evil. I mean, there's probably...

216
00:17:31,947 --> 00:17:33,708
I think it's a great.

217
00:17:33,808 --> 00:17:36,989
Yeah, people were just just doing the best that we can in

218
00:17:37,109 --> 00:17:40,791
environments that we are in. And we're looking around us to

219
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:45,033
figure out what's right and what's wrong. And so when things

220
00:17:45,113 --> 00:17:50,296
are sort of gradually moving in a bad direction, a lot of us

221
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:53,317
will move with it too. And

222
00:17:53,991 --> 00:18:15,418
But that also means that if we, we can move things in a good direction, and we can move a lot of people to as well so that's the sort of the upside and downside there is that we're moving as a group one way or another group norms are really powerful, and that you need to think about the group behavior and not just the individual.

223
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:17,679
Yeah.

224
00:18:20,373 --> 00:18:25,897
Somebody in chat, Cherry, said almost like we have a systemic problem, eh?

225
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:35,083
Yeah. Can you talk a little bit about Emily's general theory of human behavior? That was

226
00:18:35,143 --> 00:18:40,307
interesting, and it's good that you, you know, name a theory after us. I haven't done that yet,

227
00:18:40,387 --> 00:18:43,489
but, you know, I need to figure mine out. Well, I, I...

228
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:48,611
I didn't mostly as much as possible.

229
00:18:48,631 --> 00:18:50,572
I try to give references.

230
00:18:50,632 --> 00:18:52,053
I try to give back up,

231
00:18:52,373 --> 00:18:55,775
but this is just me talking and graphs and everything.

232
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:59,897
I mean, I am a stats geek.

233
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:03,779
I'm going to, I had a chance to spell curve in.

234
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:04,979
Of course I'm going to do that.

235
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,681
Spell curve and Emily's theory.

236
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:10,582
That's me.

237
00:19:11,863 --> 00:19:13,704
I'm staying on brand

238
00:19:13,724 --> 00:19:15,205
given what I'm talking about a heavy subject.

239
00:19:17,225 --> 00:19:19,426
So, but yeah, I talked about it a little bit before.

240
00:19:19,466 --> 00:19:23,549
It's essentially that there's some percentage of people

241
00:19:23,569 --> 00:19:26,331
that will always be good in some situation.

242
00:19:26,351 --> 00:19:28,212
And there's some people who will always be predatory,

243
00:19:28,612 --> 00:19:30,913
but most of us are in the middle,

244
00:19:32,835 --> 00:19:34,216
in a kind of bell curve

245
00:19:34,456 --> 00:19:37,558
around whatever the group norms were in.

246
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:42,661
And group norms are set by leaders

247
00:19:42,841 --> 00:19:45,543
and by kind of the culture that we live in.

248
00:19:46,439 --> 00:19:53,061
And we, there's not only so much we can do about the culture that we live in, but leaders can have

249
00:19:53,081 --> 00:20:00,604
a really disproportionate impact on what, how group norms in bringing in, bringing them for

250
00:20:00,844 --> 00:20:06,126
good. In some cases, I talk about big, huge games and what they've done there, or Uber being the

251
00:20:06,526 --> 00:20:12,128
example of leaders pulling sort of a lawlessness and sort of disregard for harm.

252
00:20:16,477 --> 00:20:24,299
And I think, you know, I grew up moving all over the world and living a lot of different places.

253
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:31,181
And I think when you have that experience of going, seeing people are people, but also how they behave,

254
00:20:31,321 --> 00:20:33,442
organize is really differently in different places.

255
00:20:34,402 --> 00:20:39,523
It really helps give you that kind of distance of, oh, culture is not one thing.

256
00:20:39,623 --> 00:20:41,464
Culture is us coming together.

257
00:20:41,484 --> 00:20:41,544
And.

258
00:20:43,131 --> 00:20:46,915
Not consciously deciding it's one thing, but iteratively deciding it's one thing.

259
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:53,844
So, oh sorry. I was reading in chat, someone's bullying the Gamma Suture website design right

260
00:20:53,884 --> 00:20:58,109
now and I was getting defensive. Oh wait, let's look at this real quick.

261
00:20:58,437 --> 00:21:02,201
Yeah, I want to follow up on that, but like you just gave a really excellent talk on that.

262
00:21:02,241 --> 00:21:05,083
So the better option would be just to have people get your full thoughts

263
00:21:05,143 --> 00:21:09,628
and the thought or thoughts in your talk that I had time to rehearse.

264
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:14,812
And I was going to be like, all right, what are your quick tips for fixing studio cultures?

265
00:21:14,832 --> 00:21:16,014
And like, that's not the way to handle it.

266
00:21:18,576 --> 00:21:19,557
Sure it is. Yeah.

267
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:30,285
Yeah, okay, so I think that maybe we should talk a little bit about, you know, double loop games

268
00:21:31,286 --> 00:21:37,730
and things that, you know, on the business side of what you do. Can you talk about,

269
00:21:39,151 --> 00:21:43,953
tell us a little bit about double loop and what you're trying to do differently there?

270
00:21:44,534 --> 00:21:50,037
Yeah, so double loop is, sort of comes back to kind of my experience as

271
00:21:52,360 --> 00:22:03,764
As a gamer, somebody who plays games a lot, who really enjoys them, but doesn't have that core identity, that core gamer identity.

272
00:22:04,284 --> 00:22:08,126
And for a long time, in the game industry, I sort of felt like I had a...

273
00:22:08,893 --> 00:22:10,314
certain level of imposter syndrome.

274
00:22:10,674 --> 00:22:12,215
And then we started doing mobile publishing

275
00:22:12,515 --> 00:22:15,497
and the team would joke about the Emily test,

276
00:22:15,577 --> 00:22:18,879
the games that I played more than six or seven sessions

277
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:20,960
were always our hits.

278
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,162
I was like, the team wasn't gonna sign Adventure Capitalist

279
00:22:25,182 --> 00:22:26,843
for mobile and I was like, no, we have to,

280
00:22:26,883 --> 00:22:29,144
I can't stop playing it, right?

281
00:22:29,704 --> 00:22:32,706
And that made me realize that what it felt like,

282
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:39,654
What was giving me imposter syndrome was actually a strength. I represent the big mass market of

283
00:22:40,214 --> 00:22:46,460
mobile players who play games and love games but don't think of themselves as gamers. And

284
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,903
you know, there's no part of the games industry that's not competitive, but if there's one part

285
00:22:50,924 --> 00:22:57,109
of the market that's underserved, it's that part. And I want to make games for that audience. You

286
00:22:57,129 --> 00:23:00,191
know, I want to do what most people in the games industry want to do. I want to make games for

287
00:23:00,231 --> 00:23:01,893
myself. And that...

288
00:23:02,495 --> 00:23:07,518
It really focuses a lot around why I play games, which is when I'm most stressed.

289
00:23:07,578 --> 00:23:11,880
That's when I'm on my couch playing, you know, match threes and tower defense and

290
00:23:11,941 --> 00:23:15,843
idle games and have basketball or the British baking show in the background.

291
00:23:16,163 --> 00:23:24,688
And so I want to make really the relaxing games and I want to make games that are

292
00:23:24,768 --> 00:23:28,951
really social and that help connect us to people and bring those two things together.

293
00:23:29,998 --> 00:23:36,444
So we're not talking about the title that we're making yet because of there's a lot of cloning

294
00:23:36,544 --> 00:23:41,488
in mobile. So when you do something innovative you try to, you know, keep it close to your chest

295
00:23:41,548 --> 00:23:46,132
until you absolutely have to show it. But that's the general sort of mindset that we're taking to

296
00:23:46,232 --> 00:23:51,656
it. We're still a small team which is really fun. Congregate was like 120 people towards the end

297
00:23:51,716 --> 00:23:56,600
and it's lovely to be back to, you know, the number of people you can fit around a table and really

298
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,161
talk to. We're about eight people right now.

299
00:23:59,236 --> 00:24:01,998
And yeah, we're hoping to launch sometime in 2021.

300
00:24:02,939 --> 00:24:06,181
I feel like when you hear people talk about games in that category

301
00:24:06,221 --> 00:24:08,382
that are like the casual games, like the farm bills

302
00:24:08,402 --> 00:24:10,944
or like sitting on your couch with your mobile phone, kind of like the mom games.

303
00:24:10,984 --> 00:24:14,046
I don't I don't like that term, but I know like kind of where it comes from

304
00:24:14,266 --> 00:24:17,448
that you hear about it as like, oh, here's this untapped market market.

305
00:24:17,488 --> 00:24:20,010
Here's how to get women into games and how to make money off of them.

306
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:23,092
But you guys seem to be taking a lot more like personal.

307
00:24:23,152 --> 00:24:25,313
We just want to create something enjoyable approach with it.

308
00:24:25,868 --> 00:24:33,674
Yeah, you know, I think the best games are always made with real emotion and real respect and understanding for the audience.

309
00:24:34,234 --> 00:24:38,238
And I want to take advantage of the fact that I am that sort of mom gamer.

310
00:24:38,925 --> 00:24:45,409
in the games industry. There's not a lot of us in the games industry for lots of reasons.

311
00:24:45,869 --> 00:24:52,394
I really think that we, and Shelby is also, my co-founder is also a mom. I'm not a mom,

312
00:24:52,474 --> 00:25:00,499
actually. I'm a mom. I love those types of, I'm not a mom either, but that term defines me.

313
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,362
Because we're the audience, we can make better games.

314
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:14,904
And more sort of authentic and joyful games because we're not guessing what somebody likes.

315
00:25:15,184 --> 00:25:20,046
We are, we know what we like. We know who they are and we think we can make better games.

316
00:25:20,507 --> 00:25:24,448
It's a refreshing perspective. I'll say that much about it. It's nice to like hear

317
00:25:24,788 --> 00:25:28,150
how you guys have phrased it and like your press release when you guys announced your

318
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:31,911
seed funding was just like this really heartwarming way of describing a market

319
00:25:31,931 --> 00:25:34,312
that I feel like doesn't usually get that kind of loving attention.

320
00:25:35,845 --> 00:25:39,427
That's, I don't want to call anybody out

321
00:25:39,447 --> 00:25:40,947
because there's lots of amazing games out there

322
00:25:40,967 --> 00:25:43,508
that I've played a lot of, but I also,

323
00:25:43,588 --> 00:25:47,069
but I, it's something that I struggled with

324
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:50,450
in the industry is feeling like the kind of player

325
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:53,771
that I am and that kind of audience is less respected.

326
00:25:54,312 --> 00:25:56,452
And I think it's equally, it's a-

327
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:58,713
It's a great audience.

328
00:25:59,093 --> 00:25:59,933
I don't lie.

329
00:26:00,133 --> 00:26:03,194
And you know, and our needs are just as valid.

330
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:03,655
And-

331
00:26:04,461 --> 00:26:09,263
You know, I'm here and I want to make games on that premise.

332
00:26:09,664 --> 00:26:13,966
Yeah. Well, when you're going around and you're trying to raise funding for this,

333
00:26:15,847 --> 00:26:22,131
when you tell them what kind of audience you are targeting, is there a reservation? Do you have to

334
00:26:22,211 --> 00:26:29,415
really, like, argue for it? Or... No, I mean, you know, the numbers are just there, you know.

335
00:26:30,949 --> 00:26:33,431
Mobile is half of the game industry now.

336
00:26:33,451 --> 00:26:36,973
I mean, and that's just meteoric growth

337
00:26:37,033 --> 00:26:38,133
in the last decade.

338
00:26:38,694 --> 00:26:43,156
And when you look at surveys of the US market,

339
00:26:43,276 --> 00:26:44,937
70% of people who play games on mobile

340
00:26:45,017 --> 00:26:46,358
don't think of themselves as gamers.

341
00:26:46,518 --> 00:26:48,739
You know, you're talking about 70% of the market.

342
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,281
You know, it's hard to deny it.

343
00:26:53,102 --> 00:26:55,864
And I also think that one of the changes that I've seen

344
00:26:55,944 --> 00:26:58,285
since we raised money for Congregate,

345
00:26:59,282 --> 00:27:00,742
And I think that's a really important thing to remember.

346
00:27:00,782 --> 00:27:03,944
And I think that's one of the things that we learned in 2006 is that there is more appreciation of.

347
00:27:04,024 --> 00:27:08,767
That the audience game audience is broader than it was originally was thought to be.

348
00:27:09,307 --> 00:27:10,508
And that.

349
00:27:11,788 --> 00:27:14,890
Diverse founders and diverse voices.

350
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:16,871
Can help fill that gap.

351
00:27:17,331 --> 00:27:17,671
It was.

352
00:27:17,691 --> 00:27:19,953
I didn't really believe in sexism.

353
00:27:20,553 --> 00:27:21,113
Until.

354
00:27:21,674 --> 00:27:23,174
We raised money for congregate.

355
00:27:28,049 --> 00:27:31,851
Going through the double loop process, just to feel a big reversal on that.

356
00:27:31,891 --> 00:27:34,853
Now, you know, it helps that, you know, I'm a repeat founder.

357
00:27:34,873 --> 00:27:38,395
VC is always like that, but I, but I think that there was an attitude

358
00:27:38,455 --> 00:27:40,656
shift, even independent of that.

359
00:27:40,756 --> 00:27:45,879
And I have a lot of female friends who are starting studios now and

360
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,001
able to raise money in publishing.

361
00:27:48,241 --> 00:27:52,283
Um, there's a, you know, there, there's just a whole wave of us that I think,

362
00:27:52,563 --> 00:27:55,125
um, will be helping to change the industry going forward.

363
00:27:57,494 --> 00:28:00,855
What parallels do you see right now versus 2006

364
00:28:01,235 --> 00:28:03,897
when you founded Kongregate?

365
00:28:04,577 --> 00:28:07,458
Are there any parallels you see with like mobile,

366
00:28:08,059 --> 00:28:09,179
the mobile game market,

367
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:11,800
or is it just a completely different ball game?

368
00:28:12,501 --> 00:28:14,742
You know, it's really, it's such a different ball game.

369
00:28:14,782 --> 00:28:15,902
And you know, in 2006,

370
00:28:15,942 --> 00:28:19,064
we were all still on feature phones, right?

371
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:22,205
Like I was playing Bejeweled on, you know, my little Nokia.

372
00:28:22,526 --> 00:28:22,726
Snake.

373
00:28:23,026 --> 00:28:23,246
And,

374
00:28:24,306 --> 00:28:24,827
and that,

375
00:28:26,073 --> 00:28:31,757
The mobile games market was controlled by the carriers and jammed at, you know, EA had just bought Jamdat.

376
00:28:32,638 --> 00:28:39,743
And mobile was really just like not even a gleam in the eye of, or barely a gleam in the eye in

377
00:28:39,763 --> 00:28:45,587
terms of like, you know, could being half of the industry. And the other thing was that free-to-play

378
00:28:45,847 --> 00:28:54,013
was not, was nascent. It was really growing in China and Korea, but it hadn't come to the West

379
00:28:54,053 --> 00:28:55,394
yet. And so.

380
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:02,561
The amount of change that's happened in the industry in 14 years is kind of astounding.

381
00:29:03,741 --> 00:29:07,362
And it's been a fun ride.

382
00:29:07,462 --> 00:29:12,923
And it's also been one where every year it's been about expanding the game industry

383
00:29:12,963 --> 00:29:15,224
and expanding the audience and getting bigger.

384
00:29:15,244 --> 00:29:23,346
And it's lovely to be in an expanding market as opposed to one where it's a shrinking market

385
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:24,566
where everybody's defensive.

386
00:29:24,626 --> 00:29:24,906
This is

387
00:29:25,416 --> 00:29:30,573
In a growing market, it's easier to be optimistic and collaborative and

388
00:29:31,094 --> 00:29:32,238
lots of things like that that I like.

389
00:29:33,226 --> 00:29:48,390
I'm kind of like keeping an eye on chat at the same time, so I apologize if I'm like re-asking the same thing that Chris just asked, but considering how much experience you have in like the PC and like browser-based games, are there a lot of parallels to mobile games in those kind of like how the players are, how the games are formulated?

390
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:55,972
Yeah, I mean the browser games in the late 2000s or you know, sorry, late 2000s.

391
00:29:56,395 --> 00:30:00,196
Like 2007 when we launched through 2013,

392
00:30:00,236 --> 00:30:03,717
you know, that was where you went to play

393
00:30:04,057 --> 00:30:06,177
sort of the quick games, you know,

394
00:30:06,217 --> 00:30:09,158
when you wanted to play a game for like 10 minute sessions

395
00:30:09,818 --> 00:30:12,699
and to, you know, to feel that,

396
00:30:13,619 --> 00:30:15,619
see the innovation in terms of mechanics.

397
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:19,980
And it was sort of the most accessible path

398
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,601
compared to consoles or, you know,

399
00:30:22,641 --> 00:30:24,541
doing a big heavy download when you're.

400
00:30:25,801 --> 00:30:32,748
Your internet sucked. Browser games was the accessible format. And now mobile is the most

401
00:30:32,788 --> 00:30:36,171
accessible format, so that's where you see the biggest audience. But, you know, browser games

402
00:30:36,211 --> 00:30:43,138
aren't dead. They're the most accessible format of PC. You know, it's been pretty traumatizing

403
00:30:43,158 --> 00:30:44,700
to have Flash go away. Yeah.

404
00:30:46,467 --> 00:30:53,152
But you know HTML5 and a lot of other technologies have really developed and you can make

405
00:30:53,393 --> 00:31:00,539
you know quite good games for browser now and as long as that as kids are allowed to do their

406
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:06,143
schoolwork on computers when but not allowed to play on on phones or consoles browser games will

407
00:31:06,163 --> 00:31:07,525
never die. Yeah.

408
00:31:08,065 --> 00:31:12,287
I think my circle in high school definitely got all of the good

409
00:31:12,307 --> 00:31:16,448
like congregate level sites blocked because of just the sheer volume of time we spent on there.

410
00:31:16,508 --> 00:31:20,649
So one of the secrets of congregate is I think we,

411
00:31:20,749 --> 00:31:23,570
because we didn't have name, our name and our title,

412
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:27,831
we were less likely to get blocked by school administrators than other sites.

413
00:31:28,172 --> 00:31:31,113
So we were kind of like the stealth game site you could play.

414
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:33,353
Generations appreciate that.

415
00:31:34,714 --> 00:31:35,754
We stumbled into it.

416
00:31:36,771 --> 00:31:40,232
Olivia Schwerz and Chad agrees, I grew up playing browser games.

417
00:31:40,252 --> 00:31:43,213
I didn't have a console for a while and no handhelds.

418
00:31:43,293 --> 00:31:45,453
So they were my gaming experiences.

419
00:31:46,593 --> 00:31:48,994
Some really innovative flash games that I remember playing

420
00:31:49,014 --> 00:31:50,735
that just had like that really good influence on you.

421
00:31:51,655 --> 00:31:55,636
Yeah, I actually kind of heartening that flash games were such the,

422
00:31:55,716 --> 00:32:00,037
you know, disrespected backwater back when, you know, Kongregate was at the payday.

423
00:32:00,057 --> 00:32:02,278
It's like, oh, flash games, they're not real games.

424
00:32:02,658 --> 00:32:03,258
But now.

425
00:32:04,446 --> 00:32:13,357
With Flash dying, there's been so much appreciation of how much innovation there was and how much it was really like the birth of indies.

426
00:32:13,377 --> 00:32:22,429
And when you look both at mobile and at PC indie, there's so many threads of big hits that came out of Flash.

427
00:32:23,459 --> 00:32:30,242
You know, Meat Boy being an example, or, you know, Angry Birds is essentially, you know,

428
00:32:30,502 --> 00:32:36,885
a re-skin of Crush the Castle. Like, there's just, there's so much, Flash Games gave so much to the

429
00:32:36,925 --> 00:32:42,187
rest of the industry, and I feel like it's getting a little bit more appreciated now that it's

430
00:32:42,808 --> 00:32:47,490
almost dead, because that's... Sorry, I know someone just mentioned elf-fooling in chat,

431
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:49,591
and I just went all the way back. Oh, yeah.

432
00:32:50,536 --> 00:32:54,000
It's nice to see the preservation efforts that people have stepped up to to archive

433
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:54,381
these games.

434
00:32:54,401 --> 00:32:55,602
And that's really important.

435
00:32:55,642 --> 00:32:59,107
And it's that same heartwarming feeling you were just talking about, that people do care

436
00:32:59,147 --> 00:32:59,687
about these still.

437
00:32:59,708 --> 00:33:00,168
Yeah, absolutely.

438
00:33:00,188 --> 00:33:00,268
Yeah.

439
00:33:00,288 --> 00:33:00,368
Yeah.

440
00:33:00,408 --> 00:33:00,509
Yeah.

441
00:33:00,529 --> 00:33:00,629
Yeah.

442
00:33:00,649 --> 00:33:00,729
Yeah.

443
00:33:00,749 --> 00:33:00,829
Yeah.

444
00:33:00,869 --> 00:33:00,969
Yeah.

445
00:33:00,989 --> 00:33:01,069
Yeah.

446
00:33:01,089 --> 00:33:01,189
Yeah.

447
00:33:01,249 --> 00:33:01,490
Yeah.

448
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:01,630
Yeah.

449
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:01,750
Yeah.

450
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:01,850
Yeah.

451
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:01,950
Yeah.

452
00:33:02,051 --> 00:33:02,311
Yeah.

453
00:33:02,331 --> 00:33:02,451
Yeah.

454
00:33:02,471 --> 00:33:02,631
Yeah.

455
00:33:02,651 --> 00:33:02,731
Yeah.

456
00:33:02,751 --> 00:33:02,832
Yeah.

457
00:33:03,868 --> 00:33:09,594
And so what's your take on overall on the, we've got like a couple of minutes here,

458
00:33:10,295 --> 00:33:16,701
what's your take on the mobile game market right now? Because there is a lot of reach obviously,

459
00:33:17,442 --> 00:33:22,066
but that also means, you know, there's a lot, it's inundated, it's very crowded. How do you

460
00:33:22,187 --> 00:33:26,211
deal with that as a startup? I'm gonna

461
00:33:27,855 --> 00:33:33,019
Raise quite a bit of money is the one.

462
00:33:33,299 --> 00:33:37,602
You have to break through the noise, but there's a lot of opportunity there.

463
00:33:37,842 --> 00:33:46,049
You are seeing new hits break out every year and get up into the top 10 and top 20.

464
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:53,134
And if you look at it, you know, because the market is so big, a lot of games.

465
00:33:54,140 --> 00:34:00,864
are not necessarily famous, but are able to break through to a significant level and,

466
00:34:00,884 --> 00:34:08,329
you know, really sustain a studio and grow. But, you know, you have to, you know, you have to make

467
00:34:08,369 --> 00:34:12,912
a great game that resonates emotionally, which is always hard, and you have to figure out the

468
00:34:12,932 --> 00:34:19,496
marketing side. And both of those are important. It's been, you used to get a lot more out of

469
00:34:19,536 --> 00:34:23,498
featuring. And that was one of the things that was sort of, it's been very hard.

470
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:28,624
To watch in the last few years is how much the value of featuring has decreased.

471
00:34:28,644 --> 00:34:30,866
So you can't just build a business off of that.

472
00:34:30,906 --> 00:34:32,287
You have to figure out marketing.

473
00:34:32,748 --> 00:34:35,910
Now, I've spent my whole career in marketing, right?

474
00:34:35,951 --> 00:34:36,551
Like I did that.

475
00:34:36,871 --> 00:34:39,393
That was what I did for 10 years before I even got into games.

476
00:34:39,474 --> 00:34:43,097
So it, you know, it's sort of comfortable and familiar territory,

477
00:34:43,717 --> 00:34:48,681
but it's challenging and it requires both, you know,

478
00:34:48,761 --> 00:34:50,823
infrastructure and capital.

479
00:34:51,481 --> 00:35:00,628
That makes it hard for a small indie to break out in a big way.

480
00:35:01,788 --> 00:35:07,813
But that's the story, unfortunately, of most of the game industry.

481
00:35:08,073 --> 00:35:13,857
Consoles and other things where consolidation towards bigger players.

482
00:35:14,724 --> 00:35:19,865
We were in some ways I think we were kind of spoiled for a while with how much diversity

483
00:35:19,925 --> 00:35:26,707
we could sustain but that's not how markets work. They tend to crush that. But it is really

484
00:35:26,747 --> 00:35:32,428
great to still see you know how much diversity and how much interesting stuff goes on in especially

485
00:35:32,448 --> 00:35:39,049
the PC world and you know both on Steam and places like Itch. There's you know there's a lot of

486
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:41,110
there's a lot of

487
00:35:41,747 --> 00:35:46,832
Good small games. I think a lot of games doing well on Switch, so there's still a market there.

488
00:35:48,213 --> 00:35:52,157
Mobile though is definitely pretty dominated by big players.

489
00:35:53,278 --> 00:35:55,741
Well, I think that you're going to do great.

490
00:35:56,660 --> 00:36:01,163
Got a pretty good track record and you're pretty good with a bell curve.

491
00:36:01,303 --> 00:36:05,987
So I think that, uh, we want to be on the good side of that.

492
00:36:06,067 --> 00:36:07,848
And then also we want that hockey stick curve.

493
00:36:07,888 --> 00:36:10,990
That's actually, that's the kind of curve I want to, I want to drop.

494
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:13,352
We're going to have you back just to talk about different

495
00:36:13,392 --> 00:36:15,513
graphs and things like that.

496
00:36:15,533 --> 00:36:18,075
But only in the audio format, you'll have to describe them verbally.

497
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:18,956
Yeah.

498
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:20,257
The graphs with the Chris graft.

499
00:36:22,301 --> 00:36:24,582
So, well, thank you so much for joining us.

500
00:36:26,062 --> 00:36:31,163
Just a reminder, this, Emily's Talk is free on this platform.

501
00:36:31,203 --> 00:36:35,804
So if you're listening to this right now live, you can go to it.

502
00:36:36,425 --> 00:36:39,005
Just look for Emily's Talk from Thursday.

503
00:36:40,026 --> 00:36:46,107
It's also going to be, I mean, it's free for anyone to, like, register and watch it, too.

504
00:36:46,427 --> 00:36:52,089
Emily's talk, which was called RESPECT, Practical Tips to Prevent Abuse and Build Team Trust,

505
00:36:52,149 --> 00:36:53,770
if you want keywords to look for.

506
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:54,630
Yeah.

507
00:36:55,370 --> 00:37:02,953
And that talk, ever since I learned the name of it, RESPECT, like that, the song has been

508
00:37:02,973 --> 00:37:04,413
stuck in my head ever since.

509
00:37:04,774 --> 00:37:06,114
So effective marketing.

510
00:37:06,374 --> 00:37:07,154
You are a marketer.

511
00:37:07,394 --> 00:37:07,555
So.

512
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:16,903
And also there is a write-up on gamasutra.com, and it's kind of, it touches on a few points,

513
00:37:17,243 --> 00:37:24,329
but it also includes a link to Emily's full presentation deck along with notes. So please,

514
00:37:24,349 --> 00:37:30,355
you know, take advantage of that, show that to your co-workers, you know, that's,

515
00:37:30,535 --> 00:37:31,656
and that's what it's there for.

516
00:37:32,537 --> 00:37:39,388
I really had to squeeze to get it into 45 minutes, so there's stuff in the notes that I had to cut out and not say.

517
00:37:40,369 --> 00:37:44,556
It's good to watch it all, but it's also good to read the notes and see what things I had to cut.

518
00:37:45,128 --> 00:37:54,050
Yeah, absolutely. So, well, thanks again. So, we're going to take a break for a few minutes

519
00:37:54,210 --> 00:38:01,451
for a word from our sponsor, and then the Yamasutra team will be back to just hang out.

520
00:38:02,091 --> 00:38:07,052
So, we'll be in chat. Please don't go anywhere. And thanks again, Emily. Really appreciate it.

521
00:38:07,072 --> 00:38:07,572
Thank you so much.

522
00:38:07,612 --> 00:38:08,993
Thank you. I really appreciate the opportunity.

523
00:38:10,652 --> 00:38:13,816
Next, we'd like to welcome one of our sponsors, Julie Shoemaker,

524
00:38:14,136 --> 00:38:16,959
VP of Operate Solutions at Unity.

525
00:38:16,979 --> 00:38:18,841
Hey, Julie, thanks for joining us.

526
00:38:19,461 --> 00:38:20,923
Thank you so much, Chris. Good to be here.

527
00:38:21,423 --> 00:38:25,488
Yeah, awesome. So, can you tell us a little bit about yourself,

528
00:38:26,148 --> 00:38:29,752
your background in the game industry and what you do at Unity?

529
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:34,985
Great. Well, I've had the pleasure to be in the game industry now 20 years.

530
00:38:35,085 --> 00:38:38,347
I joined Electronic Arts in 2001

531
00:38:39,528 --> 00:38:41,790
on the licensing and advertising side

532
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:44,493
and have followed a journey through games,

533
00:38:44,993 --> 00:38:48,696
multi-platform from social play and mobile,

534
00:38:49,717 --> 00:38:51,558
largely on the game publisher side.

535
00:38:52,459 --> 00:38:57,023
And in 2016, I was able to take that learning

536
00:38:57,483 --> 00:38:59,685
and come over to Unity.

537
00:39:00,532 --> 00:39:05,635
And help do those services on behalf of the industry.

538
00:39:05,715 --> 00:39:10,559
In essence, my revenue responsibility in Operate Solutions

539
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:13,361
spans from monetization products,

540
00:39:13,441 --> 00:39:16,363
largely the part of the business we're going to talk about today

541
00:39:16,443 --> 00:39:17,844
with the COVID-19 study,

542
00:39:18,664 --> 00:39:21,927
as well as cloud services, player engagement,

543
00:39:22,007 --> 00:39:25,729
which was one area where we pulled a lot of data about game behavior,

544
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:28,731
and finally, of course, advertising.

545
00:39:29,372 --> 00:39:29,572
So...

546
00:39:30,776 --> 00:39:34,860
My primary mission at Unity is to enable developer success

547
00:39:35,421 --> 00:39:38,244
so that they can build strong and profitable businesses.

548
00:39:38,965 --> 00:39:42,729
Interesting. So you mentioned the COVID-19 report,

549
00:39:42,969 --> 00:39:46,453
and of course that's top of mind for a lot of people in games right now

550
00:39:46,513 --> 00:39:49,716
and why we're doing this on video. So can you talk about

551
00:39:49,896 --> 00:39:52,899
that report and how Unity gathered that data?

552
00:39:53,872 --> 00:39:57,674
Yeah, so Chris, I think when you and I started this call,

553
00:39:58,015 --> 00:39:59,376
before we clicked the video,

554
00:39:59,436 --> 00:40:01,397
we were just chatting about the new normal.

555
00:40:01,697 --> 00:40:06,501
And of course, we were watching what was happening

556
00:40:06,841 --> 00:40:10,624
in predominantly Asia as they were sheltering in place

557
00:40:10,664 --> 00:40:12,025
in January and February.

558
00:40:12,625 --> 00:40:14,567
So the week of March 8th,

559
00:40:14,827 --> 00:40:18,489
when World Health Organization declared global pandemic

560
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:22,612
is really when what we consider in the COVID report,

561
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:22,753
the...

562
00:40:23,395 --> 00:40:28,239
The bulk of the shift in behavior and some of the data behind this.

563
00:40:28,979 --> 00:40:35,723
The methodology of the COVID-19 report is that we first started with a baseline

564
00:40:36,624 --> 00:40:44,469
growth to compare against 2019 as our baseline number. So in essence to normalize what is

565
00:40:44,549 --> 00:40:52,975
already a growing industry of games, we took a normalized data set starting in Jan 1 and then we

566
00:40:53,708 --> 00:40:56,829
added mobile information that we secure

567
00:40:56,889 --> 00:41:00,290
from the Unity monetization platform on usage in mobile.

568
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:03,871
We then also complemented that data

569
00:41:04,031 --> 00:41:07,593
with a source of information on PC and console gaming

570
00:41:07,653 --> 00:41:11,134
from our Made with Unity content as a development platform.

571
00:41:11,714 --> 00:41:14,055
And finally, we took player engagement data

572
00:41:14,195 --> 00:41:16,636
anonymized through our Delta DNA product

573
00:41:16,656 --> 00:41:19,016
that helped us see engagement rates

574
00:41:19,136 --> 00:41:23,038
as well as the revenue implications of COVID-19.

575
00:41:24,187 --> 00:41:30,748
Okay, so when you're reviewing this data, what was the most surprising aspects of it

576
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:31,848
that jumped out to you?

577
00:41:33,489 --> 00:41:34,689
Well, first of all, many.

578
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:45,911
I mean, we were humbled by, you know, this very difficult time in the world that games

579
00:41:46,291 --> 00:41:46,492
have

580
00:41:47,185 --> 00:41:49,565
Shown that they're bringing a real bright spot.

581
00:41:50,125 --> 00:41:53,026
And so a couple of the data points that jumped out was,

582
00:41:53,086 --> 00:41:57,847
first of all, 46% increase in daily active users

583
00:41:58,107 --> 00:41:59,588
in PC and console gaming.

584
00:42:00,468 --> 00:42:07,950
And that data jumped out because it really shines a light on families.

585
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:11,130
You know, what we used to call, like, the virtual...

586
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:16,792
Card or board game is now your Xbox in the living room

587
00:42:16,832 --> 00:42:17,893
with your family members.

588
00:42:19,494 --> 00:42:22,055
The bright spot in even mobile gaming,

589
00:42:23,096 --> 00:42:24,997
17% increase in daily active users

590
00:42:25,718 --> 00:42:29,880
just showed that people wanted this sense of community,

591
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:34,002
sense of play, and of course,

592
00:42:34,683 --> 00:42:37,744
ability to focus on something that might be more positive

593
00:42:37,764 --> 00:42:40,306
for their mindshare than what was happening

594
00:42:40,326 --> 00:42:41,267
in the world at the time.

595
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:55,725
And I saw the survey also showed increases in ad viewing and really like huge increase in app downloads 84% increase and increase in downloads.

596
00:42:55,745 --> 00:42:55,966
So.

597
00:42:59,955 --> 00:43:05,998
Can all, like all of this is, you know, just because people are at home and having more downtime then?

598
00:43:06,038 --> 00:43:08,380
Is that the conclusion or is there any other factors?

599
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,242
Well, I think what we look at is, first of all, if we think about the ad impressions.

600
00:43:12,282 --> 00:43:13,582
So ad impressions increase 57%.

601
00:43:13,682 --> 00:43:13,902
Okay.

602
00:43:15,283 --> 00:43:22,147
And in our category, ad impressions are often an opportunity of discovery for players.

603
00:43:22,787 --> 00:43:26,189
So if you're going to increase impressions, you're actually increasing the likelihood

604
00:43:26,209 --> 00:43:28,850
that they're discovering new apps and downloading those apps.

605
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:29,670
So that's one thing.

606
00:43:31,502 --> 00:43:40,925
Another area, when we go back to that 17% increase in daily active players also means new players.

607
00:43:41,485 --> 00:43:45,746
And new players have more room to grow in their what games I'm going to play.

608
00:43:46,426 --> 00:43:54,668
So we see that the increase in downloads is connected to many of the behaviors combined.

609
00:43:56,709 --> 00:44:02,434
So when you're looking at this data, what are some practical ways,

610
00:44:02,754 --> 00:44:06,317
you know, some takeaways that game developers can take from, you know,

611
00:44:06,337 --> 00:44:10,700
they look at this report, how can they apply the information that they have,

612
00:44:10,841 --> 00:44:12,222
like to what they're doing?

613
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:16,185
Well, I think first of all, we would say, um,

614
00:44:16,365 --> 00:44:19,568
many of the game developers that have benefited greatly

615
00:44:20,354 --> 00:44:26,246
have been dual economy and they have IEP based revenues, which have increased as well.

616
00:44:27,148 --> 00:44:29,754
And actually, IEP went up 24%.

617
00:44:31,468 --> 00:44:32,429
during this window.

618
00:44:33,049 --> 00:44:38,051
So that means consumer pay increased, as did ad pay.

619
00:44:38,171 --> 00:44:42,653
So the developers that have both economies

620
00:44:43,293 --> 00:44:46,694
did have greater opportunity during this time.

621
00:44:46,714 --> 00:44:52,256
And of course, also greater opportunity to engage the player,

622
00:44:52,336 --> 00:44:54,657
because often a player who doesn't want to pay.

623
00:44:55,431 --> 00:45:01,436
has an opportunity to get a new level or grow their experience and engagement with the game

624
00:45:01,976 --> 00:45:07,861
through the rewarded ad business. So that would be one. Certainly on a forward-looking basis,

625
00:45:09,062 --> 00:45:14,086
our biggest guidance is that this is the opportunity for great game makers

626
00:45:14,487 --> 00:45:17,169
to engage this new pandemic player.

627
00:45:19,211 --> 00:45:27,295
So what do you think happens after things, you know, hopefully sooner rather than later go back to normal, whatever that looks like?

628
00:45:27,856 --> 00:45:34,719
Do these numbers go back down, you know, or do they go back down to where they were before lockdown happened?

629
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:42,684
Well, we see that the data shows during this now, you know, what, five and a half windows,

630
00:45:43,324 --> 00:45:48,807
five and a half months of the window of deep look at the data that we're.

631
00:45:50,211 --> 00:45:52,852
that the users are continuing to engage.

632
00:45:53,473 --> 00:45:56,735
So our guidance would be,

633
00:45:57,695 --> 00:46:00,217
we won't make a forward-looking statement

634
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:02,058
on what players are going to do in the long run,

635
00:46:02,078 --> 00:46:06,761
but we will encourage our developer economy

636
00:46:07,321 --> 00:46:09,642
to take advantage of this opportunity

637
00:46:09,702 --> 00:46:11,023
to engage these players.

638
00:46:11,543 --> 00:46:12,764
Thanks, that was really interesting.

639
00:46:12,784 --> 00:46:14,545
Thank you for joining us

640
00:46:15,145 --> 00:46:17,627
and best of luck out there and stay safe.

641
00:46:18,087 --> 00:46:18,948
Wonderful, thank you, Chris.

642
00:46:19,527 --> 00:46:19,747
Thanks.

643
00:46:21,127 --> 00:46:21,887
Hey, we're back.

644
00:46:22,267 --> 00:46:26,389
Thanks for sticking around with Julie Shoemaker from Unity.

645
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:29,470
And thank you, Unity, for sponsoring this.

646
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:34,711
I put a link in chat for that COVID-19 report,

647
00:46:34,811 --> 00:46:35,992
so make sure to check it out.

648
00:46:36,132 --> 00:46:40,033
And there will also be a link in the video on demand of this.

649
00:46:40,593 --> 00:46:43,074
So you can look at it then.

650
00:46:43,514 --> 00:46:45,154
So we're actually joined.

651
00:46:46,297 --> 00:46:48,918
by Bryant, Francis, and Alex.

652
00:46:48,978 --> 00:46:52,099
Can you all introduce yourselves a little bit more in depth?

653
00:46:52,119 --> 00:46:55,440
I'm Bryant Francis, sometimes known in the Gamasutra world as Bront.

654
00:46:57,061 --> 00:47:00,742
I'm a contributing editor at Gamasutra, and as today has shown,

655
00:47:00,762 --> 00:47:03,763
I love Star Wars a lot, if you were watching the speedrun.

656
00:47:06,138 --> 00:47:12,802
I'm Alex Waro, an editor at Gamasutra.com, and I gotta say the Gamasutra retro design is about to come back into style.

657
00:47:13,322 --> 00:47:23,369
Yeah, let's let's let's we had we had a question in the middle of our chat with with Emily Greer, which she's amazing, isn't she?

658
00:47:23,429 --> 00:47:29,093
Yeah, I wish you were able to join us for this last segment, but prior engagements and busy, important people and important things.

659
00:47:29,133 --> 00:47:32,155
Yeah, I mean, we're lucky to have we are neither busy nor important.

660
00:47:33,719 --> 00:47:34,800
I wasn't going to say it, but...

661
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:38,083
Yeah, I know. We wouldn't be doing this if we were actually busy.

662
00:47:39,445 --> 00:47:40,326
Yeah.

663
00:47:40,526 --> 00:47:41,387
Cult Zone Games.

664
00:47:41,427 --> 00:47:44,851
That's weird. Is that on the birth certificate, you think?

665
00:47:45,291 --> 00:47:48,795
Cult Zone Games?

666
00:47:48,895 --> 00:47:52,279
Where, like, when's Gamasutra

667
00:47:52,339 --> 00:47:54,041
going to renew the old site?

668
00:47:55,642 --> 00:47:57,202
Do you have any idea what they're talking about?

669
00:47:57,222 --> 00:47:57,983
I mean, what-

670
00:47:58,043 --> 00:48:00,184
I think the blinking eye Gamasutra logo

671
00:48:00,244 --> 00:48:02,424
that pops up every like six months in Slack

672
00:48:02,544 --> 00:48:04,945
should be, that should be front and center on our site.

673
00:48:06,326 --> 00:48:09,807
I haven't noticed that there's anything outdated.

674
00:48:10,893 --> 00:48:11,774
On the site.

675
00:48:11,834 --> 00:48:12,254
No.

676
00:48:12,294 --> 00:48:13,635
When did our site get named again?

677
00:48:13,715 --> 00:48:17,459
When did we name it after a Southeast Asian Indian document?

678
00:48:17,659 --> 00:48:18,780
We did not name it.

679
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,842
No, we were all later in the team.

680
00:48:21,182 --> 00:48:25,526
But I was looking this up yesterday in 1997 is when Gamma Suture was founded.

681
00:48:26,366 --> 00:48:27,427
So what a fun fact.

682
00:48:27,447 --> 00:48:29,869
We should have all known that we worked for this freaking city.

683
00:48:31,311 --> 00:48:33,773
I was looking it up to see how old I was.

684
00:48:34,073 --> 00:48:34,794
What were you all doing in 1997?

685
00:48:35,234 --> 00:48:36,495
Yeah, let's talk about this.

686
00:48:37,054 --> 00:48:38,034
Brian, you go first.

687
00:48:38,174 --> 00:48:39,936
Bronson in 1987.

688
00:48:40,416 --> 00:48:41,597
Let's see. Seven years old.

689
00:48:41,617 --> 00:48:46,641
I may not have even seen Star Wars yet because I think my mom

690
00:48:46,661 --> 00:48:47,902
may have made me wait until I was eight.

691
00:48:48,242 --> 00:48:51,425
So I would have definitely been playing with Batman figures.

692
00:48:51,525 --> 00:48:54,507
I would have been in about second grade, which means I moved to late

693
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:55,608
until Maryland by that point.

694
00:48:55,969 --> 00:48:57,370
And I was getting bullied a lot in school.

695
00:48:57,570 --> 00:48:58,350
That's what I'm pretty sure of.

696
00:48:58,370 --> 00:49:02,234
I was watching anime and eating rocks because I was like five.

697
00:49:03,875 --> 00:49:04,836
I don't know what five year old do.

698
00:49:06,302 --> 00:49:07,363
They're hardcore, apparently.

699
00:49:07,383 --> 00:49:08,223
Damn.

700
00:49:08,843 --> 00:49:11,104
Wait, Alex, what were you doing?

701
00:49:11,164 --> 00:49:12,785
You know, I was just working a job,

702
00:49:12,825 --> 00:49:14,446
just punching a clock like any average.

703
00:49:14,466 --> 00:49:16,687
I must have been 11, 12, I don't know.

704
00:49:17,047 --> 00:49:17,327
No, I was-

705
00:49:17,347 --> 00:49:18,287
You were writing content?

706
00:49:18,787 --> 00:49:20,128
Yes, right, I was just writing content

707
00:49:20,188 --> 00:49:21,248
from the day I came out of the,

708
00:49:21,388 --> 00:49:23,189
isn't that the year of the Symphony that I came out?

709
00:49:23,209 --> 00:49:24,570
I feel like, 97?

710
00:49:24,650 --> 00:49:25,750
That's probably what I was doing.

711
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:27,931
That's probably just spending my whole summer

712
00:49:27,951 --> 00:49:31,333
reading Final Fantasy VII and Symphony of the Night.

713
00:49:32,075 --> 00:49:35,719
Speaking of timely things, favorite talk so far. What have you guys covered? What do you like?

714
00:49:35,939 --> 00:49:41,584
What's going good at the show? I'll be going to, I know Emily Greer, we already, she brought up a

715
00:49:41,604 --> 00:49:46,448
lot of points in her talks, but I have to make it, put that as one of my favorite talks I covered.

716
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:51,613
She said something here on the podcast that she said specifically in the talk, which is

717
00:49:54,101 --> 00:49:55,822
Harassment is sometimes about sex,

718
00:49:55,862 --> 00:49:56,882
but it's always about power.

719
00:49:56,902 --> 00:49:58,863
And when she said that, and I'm just sitting there,

720
00:49:58,883 --> 00:50:01,944
you know, clacky clacky, and I wrote it,

721
00:50:01,964 --> 00:50:03,924
I swear to God, like mentally,

722
00:50:03,964 --> 00:50:06,545
my brain like shot backwards across the room into the wall

723
00:50:06,925 --> 00:50:08,046
from like linking things.

724
00:50:08,466 --> 00:50:10,326
Only because like, if I can get a little personal here,

725
00:50:11,507 --> 00:50:15,128
I've lived that over and over again.

726
00:50:15,148 --> 00:50:15,988
I have been,

727
00:50:17,729 --> 00:50:19,529
because it happens to men in the workplace too,

728
00:50:19,569 --> 00:50:20,970
and these aren't mostly gaming companies

729
00:50:20,990 --> 00:50:22,030
because I've worked in other places,

730
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:22,210
but.

731
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:24,990
I have been sexually harassed while I've been at work.

732
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:28,371
I've been yelled at and screamed at at different jobs.

733
00:50:28,432 --> 00:50:33,674
I've had people like, I've had different kinds of like threats thrown at me in different

734
00:50:33,714 --> 00:50:37,876
contexts and it's so weird because you spend a lot of time going like, holy, whoa, that

735
00:50:37,896 --> 00:50:38,336
was rough.

736
00:50:38,416 --> 00:50:41,797
And like, you take a day, like you cool off, you're back at work for something or another.

737
00:50:41,817 --> 00:50:47,540
And, and the line, like, it's not about.

738
00:50:48,105 --> 00:50:49,045
It's sometimes about sex.

739
00:50:49,145 --> 00:50:52,246
It's always about power and her story in the talk, which if you go watch is about

740
00:50:52,286 --> 00:50:57,088
the the random game exec who was inappropriately hitting on her dinner.

741
00:50:58,648 --> 00:51:01,089
Just like the connection there, like finally clicked in my head.

742
00:51:01,129 --> 00:51:03,810
And like, I think I started like I've spent this year, like processing

743
00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:07,871
a lot of what happened to me in that context, because when the news about

744
00:51:09,892 --> 00:51:14,053
a lot of game companies being called out this year for behavior that.

745
00:51:14,474 --> 00:51:15,774
People have experienced it, them hit.

746
00:51:15,794 --> 00:51:19,135
Like I started like when writing up some of it, I was like, oh, wait,

747
00:51:19,675 --> 00:51:20,675
I guess I've experienced this, too.

748
00:51:20,715 --> 00:51:22,996
And like that turned out you need you need to like process that

749
00:51:23,056 --> 00:51:25,556
and you need to like go deal with that in therapy.

750
00:51:25,616 --> 00:51:28,317
Like you can't just keep acting like, oh, yeah, like it's just something I cover.

751
00:51:28,697 --> 00:51:29,617
It's not something I live through.

752
00:51:29,637 --> 00:51:31,117
And it's like, oh, no, I lived through that.

753
00:51:31,337 --> 00:51:35,498
And her framing of it that way, like I think about all the companies

754
00:51:35,518 --> 00:51:39,599
that where people were power hungry, where people were like fighting for placement

755
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:40,219
or favor.

756
00:51:41,179 --> 00:51:44,280
And I'm just like, even when it wasn't sexual harassment, I was just like,

757
00:51:45,818 --> 00:51:50,321
Oh wow, like Lisa Simpson staring.jpg.

758
00:51:51,522 --> 00:51:54,364
And that just, I cannot stress enough.

759
00:51:54,384 --> 00:51:55,645
She talked about it earlier in the podcast

760
00:51:55,685 --> 00:51:57,366
and that's why I was hoping she'd be here

761
00:51:58,287 --> 00:51:59,548
to mention it to her that like,

762
00:51:59,608 --> 00:52:00,949
whoa, like that hit me like a truck.

763
00:52:01,049 --> 00:52:02,971
But you know, she's not here,

764
00:52:03,031 --> 00:52:04,212
so I can just share with you, you know,

765
00:52:04,232 --> 00:52:05,653
some deep, dramatic secrets.

766
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:07,494
And over to Alex.

767
00:52:07,514 --> 00:52:08,315
Alex, no pressure.

768
00:52:08,355 --> 00:52:10,136
What's your favorite talk?

769
00:52:10,316 --> 00:52:11,017
Men are garbage.

770
00:52:11,137 --> 00:52:12,017
That's my favorite talk.

771
00:52:12,498 --> 00:52:13,579
Wow, so woke.

772
00:52:14,019 --> 00:52:14,139
Yeah.

773
00:52:15,191 --> 00:52:18,696
Um, no, that's that's rough buddy. I, uh, I'm sorry to hear that.

774
00:52:20,639 --> 00:52:26,147
It's bad times. I, yeah, I agree. Emily's talk was fantastic. I have not watched it yet. I was

775
00:52:26,187 --> 00:52:29,732
watching some other talks today, including a really good talk on Hardspace Shipbreaker.

776
00:52:31,116 --> 00:52:31,917
I love that game.

777
00:52:31,937 --> 00:52:34,278
A sharp right turn.

778
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:36,719
I would have mentioned that talk if I hadn't because I love the game.

779
00:52:37,019 --> 00:52:40,041
The name of that game just like twists my brain sideways.

780
00:52:40,061 --> 00:52:43,723
Are you going to spoil the end of a game right now that just recently came out?

781
00:52:43,763 --> 00:52:44,163
What end?

782
00:52:44,243 --> 00:52:45,083
I can't beat it.

783
00:52:45,163 --> 00:52:46,684
I'm too busy carving spaceships.

784
00:52:47,565 --> 00:52:51,647
I can tell you why there's no end because I just watched a talk all about how that team

785
00:52:51,687 --> 00:52:55,789
had to pivot multiple times, including at one point moving from...

786
00:52:56,835 --> 00:53:03,057
What was maybe going to be a more narrative heavy and shorter game into like a longer and more broad, like systemic game.

787
00:53:03,797 --> 00:53:12,700
And I don't know, people should go watch that talk on the platform because it's packed. It is really packed with a lot of key learnings.

788
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:24,403
Yeah, it's just it's it's a remarkable chart of how an idea goes from a game jam internally to a ship product that seems to have like a huge fan base.

789
00:53:25,414 --> 00:53:47,788
I think it's really cool, really neat. It's, it's nice to see studios thriving, you know, like the folks that are Blackbird. A key part of the talk was that they see themselves much in the vein of like a blizzard or digital extremes or a psionics and that, you know, they work for other companies and they work on other IP but they really are always trying to make their own original games and like, strike it big.

790
00:53:48,414 --> 00:54:03,142
And so go watch that talk because it would take me 10 minutes to sum up here, but basically they chart the four year journey from original idea to successful original IP. I think that's really relevant these days where so many devs are trying to get noticed with their own ideas.

791
00:54:03,982 --> 00:54:09,805
Yeah. Yeah. Can I talk about mine real quick, the one that I was like, I, I covered.

792
00:54:12,864 --> 00:54:20,267
Karen Stevens from EA Sports, who is the lead accessibility lead.

793
00:54:21,947 --> 00:54:31,930
And the point that she kept driving home was that legibility is, like she said,

794
00:54:31,950 --> 00:54:36,872
if you get anything out of this talk, font-like legibility.

795
00:54:38,372 --> 00:54:39,373
You know, fix that.

796
00:54:40,013 --> 00:54:43,935
And that's my own, that's me, like,

797
00:54:44,136 --> 00:54:45,276
showing my own privilege there,

798
00:54:45,336 --> 00:54:48,078
because, like, I've got good, you know, I got good sight.

799
00:54:48,178 --> 00:54:51,320
But I do remember in 2006,

800
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:55,842
when the HD consoles were hitting Dead Rising,

801
00:54:56,082 --> 00:54:59,824
like, nobody could read the text in Rising 1 on Xbox 360.

802
00:54:59,864 --> 00:55:01,585
And here we are in 2020,

803
00:55:07,308 --> 00:55:09,389
Right? Are we still? Yeah.

804
00:55:09,509 --> 00:55:10,889
Yes, we will always be in 2020.

805
00:55:10,929 --> 00:55:12,870
Some part of us.

806
00:55:14,151 --> 00:55:20,314
So basically when Emily Greer was getting her career started up until now,

807
00:55:21,814 --> 00:55:24,695
font legibility has been like crap.

808
00:55:25,296 --> 00:55:25,596
And then...

809
00:55:25,616 --> 00:55:27,257
What do you mean? Karen Stevens or Emily Greer?

810
00:55:28,674 --> 00:55:31,697
No, I'm talking about Emily Greer's career.

811
00:55:31,737 --> 00:55:32,338
She started in 2006.

812
00:55:32,418 --> 00:55:32,578
Oh, OK.

813
00:55:32,598 --> 00:55:33,098
Yeah, yeah.

814
00:55:33,118 --> 00:55:34,500
Frame of reference.

815
00:55:36,642 --> 00:55:39,565
Yeah, we're trying to figure out frames of reference for time.

816
00:55:40,626 --> 00:55:45,130
So yeah, just the fact that that's not a fixed thing yet

817
00:55:46,751 --> 00:55:48,593
is kind of mind-blowing.

818
00:55:48,753 --> 00:55:51,756
And of course, her point is, you can add all these accessibility

819
00:55:51,876 --> 00:55:52,217
options.

820
00:55:52,677 --> 00:55:52,877
But.

821
00:55:53,498 --> 00:56:00,210
If I can't, you know, see the menu or recognize like where those options are living, where they're buried in the game.

822
00:56:00,711 --> 00:56:03,172
Then they don't really matter to so many people.

823
00:56:04,353 --> 00:56:08,795
So, yeah, I mean, and then the thing about Comic Comic Sans, like

824
00:56:09,735 --> 00:56:11,636
I think I'd heard that before and forgot about it.

825
00:56:12,677 --> 00:56:16,458
But looking up Comic Sans, I know that it's like maligned and stuff

826
00:56:16,678 --> 00:56:21,160
and made fun of, but it's good for dyslexia.

827
00:56:21,421 --> 00:56:25,022
And like designers, you know, are like, shut up.

828
00:56:25,322 --> 00:56:27,864
Stop making fun of Comic Sans.

829
00:56:27,984 --> 00:56:29,224
Like, this is good design.

830
00:56:29,244 --> 00:56:30,245
Yeah, good idea.

831
00:56:30,735 --> 00:56:47,780
Yeah, and then to have, um, and then, you know, I know that there's probably, you know, developers and like, uh, designers out there just imagining their game just covered in comic sans, uh, you know, but she's, she said, you know, the option would be good.

832
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:52,301
You know, you can have the fancy font and you can turn on a more legible font.

833
00:56:53,463 --> 00:56:53,924
as well.

834
00:56:54,285 --> 00:56:59,974
And she also brought up the point, like, you know, a game like Outer Worlds, it defaults

835
00:56:59,994 --> 00:57:01,096
to very small font.

836
00:57:01,677 --> 00:57:04,041
And then they released a patch that increases it.

837
00:57:05,781 --> 00:57:10,183
But it still defaults to that original tiny font.

838
00:57:10,483 --> 00:57:14,084
And she said, just because you add a size option

839
00:57:14,664 --> 00:57:19,246
doesn't mean that you're off the hook for making it illegible

840
00:57:19,786 --> 00:57:20,866
from when you start the game.

841
00:57:22,067 --> 00:57:24,188
So I'm like, after watching that,

842
00:57:24,208 --> 00:57:25,068
that's just changed my viewpoint on.

843
00:57:30,490 --> 00:57:34,459
on legibility and really accessibility overall.

844
00:57:34,499 --> 00:57:37,285
It's been really enlightening this week.

845
00:57:37,766 --> 00:57:39,089
So yeah, that's me.

846
00:57:39,349 --> 00:57:40,592
Alyssa, do you have a talk you wanna bring up?

847
00:57:41,053 --> 00:57:42,714
Yeah, but I also just want to comment.

848
00:57:42,974 --> 00:57:44,335
It's not a question, more of a comment.

849
00:57:45,236 --> 00:57:51,040
But it's I love talks like that because they re-contextualize accessibility.

850
00:57:51,341 --> 00:57:54,063
It's people have this very like, oh, it's colorblind settings,

851
00:57:54,103 --> 00:57:59,467
but no, it's this wider range thing that affects like people who think that they might not need accessibility features,

852
00:57:59,507 --> 00:58:01,328
but no, they benefit from them too.

853
00:58:01,348 --> 00:58:01,868
All right.

854
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:07,957
That's done. So now I will save my piece while we have two minutes left on the clock.

855
00:58:07,977 --> 00:58:13,142
I covered a talk by private divisions, Kari Toyama, about

856
00:58:13,962 --> 00:58:17,526
she set up a QA studio and it was talking about how to set that up

857
00:58:17,886 --> 00:58:21,649
from scratch to kind of give your your dev team the best chance

858
00:58:21,709 --> 00:58:23,651
and get like a really good, really productive environment.

859
00:58:24,253 --> 00:58:27,576
And I think my working title for when I was writing the article is

860
00:58:27,777 --> 00:58:29,098
Breaking QAer People Too.

861
00:58:29,638 --> 00:58:33,723
Because a lot of her talk just comes down to treating developers like human beings

862
00:58:33,863 --> 00:58:35,344
and building community. Yeah.

863
00:58:36,355 --> 00:58:41,677
It's a really great talk that focuses on her five pillars,

864
00:58:41,777 --> 00:58:43,318
six pillars that I can't find

865
00:58:43,358 --> 00:58:45,098
because I didn't organize my notes.

866
00:58:45,198 --> 00:58:47,819
Culture, diversity, relationships, advocacy, and trust.

867
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:50,840
And there's a lot of advice that is focused

868
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:52,721
on setting up a QA studio

869
00:58:52,741 --> 00:58:54,162
to make them feel included in the process.

870
00:58:54,182 --> 00:58:55,822
Because you hear horror stories of like,

871
00:58:55,862 --> 00:58:57,263
oh, they're kept in the basement with no lights

872
00:58:57,283 --> 00:58:58,603
and they're not allowed to make eye contact

873
00:58:58,643 --> 00:58:59,423
with the programmers.

874
00:59:00,284 --> 00:59:03,145
And that doesn't foster a great working relationship

875
00:59:03,185 --> 00:59:05,105
for people whose jobs actually overlap quite a bit.

876
00:59:05,788 --> 00:59:09,029
Got it. That's so frustrating, especially when you think about what Emily said.

877
00:59:09,049 --> 00:59:12,010
You read stories about how Activision used to be, or other companies.

878
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:16,851
And if you start at the beginning of her talk too, she talked a lot about how

879
00:59:17,791 --> 00:59:22,112
Emily was talking about her own experiences with sexism, even as a high up in games companies,

880
00:59:22,732 --> 00:59:26,333
and Akari was talking about a lot of her experiences. And it's just like,

881
00:59:26,353 --> 00:59:29,854
you're sitting there kind of like, no, I can see this happening, but that really sucks.

882
00:59:29,874 --> 00:59:34,455
And those bad, negative, and often sexist experiences kind of informed her philosophy

883
00:59:34,495 --> 00:59:35,375
for setting up the studio.

884
00:59:35,976 --> 00:59:39,519
I think there's a lot of really great advice in that talk that applies not only to QA,

885
00:59:39,559 --> 00:59:41,461
but just to like studio culture in general.

886
00:59:41,701 --> 00:59:43,483
So please check that out.

887
00:59:43,503 --> 00:59:44,845
It was a really great conversation.

888
00:59:45,625 --> 00:59:46,486
Yeah, sounds like it.

889
00:59:46,566 --> 00:59:50,010
And all these, these, like we wrote them up.

890
00:59:51,595 --> 00:59:55,778
on gamasutra.com. A website with a name.

891
00:59:57,819 --> 01:00:05,223
So let's wrap it up. Thank you so much everybody, especially people who showed up here in chat.

892
01:00:06,024 --> 01:00:12,147
I feel like, you know, some of you have shown up every time and we really appreciate that.

893
01:00:12,167 --> 01:00:14,869
This is a first time thing for us doing a live...

894
01:00:15,369 --> 01:00:17,572
So, hopefully we do it again.

895
01:00:18,553 --> 01:00:20,795
See some of you on Twitter and all that.

896
01:00:21,035 --> 01:00:25,220
So I think that's it.

897
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:30,365
We're going to sign off on the very first GDC summer GDC podcast live.

898
01:00:30,565 --> 01:00:32,607
So thanks, everybody.

899
01:00:32,687 --> 01:00:33,468
Have a good rest of your GDC.

900
01:00:33,488 --> 01:00:33,548
Bye.

901
01:00:33,568 --> 01:00:33,628
Bye.

902
01:00:33,648 --> 01:00:33,729
Bye.

903
01:00:33,749 --> 01:00:33,809
Bye.

904
01:00:33,829 --> 01:00:33,889
Bye.

905
01:00:33,929 --> 01:00:33,989
Bye.

906
01:00:34,009 --> 01:00:34,069
Bye.

907
01:00:34,089 --> 01:00:34,149
Bye.

908
01:00:34,309 --> 01:00:34,389
Bye.

909
01:00:34,409 --> 01:00:34,469
Bye.

910
01:00:34,489 --> 01:00:34,549
Bye.

911
01:00:34,569 --> 01:00:34,629
Bye.
