1
00:00:06,033 --> 00:00:12,916
Thank you. Let me start out by saying, never buy a new computer one week before GDC,

2
00:00:12,916 --> 00:00:15,598
because you don't know how to work it.

3
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:20,660
So the first thing is, those of you who know me know that 25 minutes is like ridiculous.

4
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:25,063
And I'm going to rip through this, and if I don't get through it all,

5
00:00:25,063 --> 00:00:27,784
I'll just finish it out there and do a poster session or something.

6
00:00:27,784 --> 00:00:28,825
So we'll see how far we get.

7
00:00:30,069 --> 00:00:35,994
So, what I want to talk about today is what we can learn from other narrative media.

8
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:40,357
That's not anything so unusual just by itself.

9
00:00:40,357 --> 00:00:43,600
Plenty of people have talked about that, but I hope I can surprise you at least a little

10
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:43,940
today.

11
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,224
There are some things I think we can learn, obviously.

12
00:00:48,224 --> 00:00:53,008
There are things we could learn that we haven't yet learned.

13
00:00:53,008 --> 00:00:56,692
But most important, to me anyway, as a contrarian,

14
00:00:56,692 --> 00:01:00,095
is that I think there are some things we shouldn't learn.

15
00:01:00,095 --> 00:01:04,979
And there are things that are sort of seductive and obvious,

16
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:09,143
but I think will hold us back as we become the medium we are capable of becoming.

17
00:01:10,477 --> 00:01:13,280
So, just, I know myself well enough

18
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,303
to know that at some point, probably several points in this talk,

19
00:01:16,303 --> 00:01:18,385
I'm gonna say something like,

20
00:01:18,385 --> 00:01:22,309
you shouldn't make games like X, Y, and Z.

21
00:01:22,309 --> 00:01:27,073
Or you should make games like A, B, and C.

22
00:01:27,073 --> 00:01:30,156
In those cases, just assume I'm exaggerating to make a point.

23
00:01:30,717 --> 00:01:33,979
or a really bad joke, or both.

24
00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:37,441
It's not my place to tell people what kinds of games to make,

25
00:01:37,441 --> 00:01:38,882
or what kind of games to like.

26
00:01:38,882 --> 00:01:40,543
Sometimes I just can't help myself.

27
00:01:42,601 --> 00:01:44,502
Now, why is it important not to be too judgmental?

28
00:01:44,502 --> 00:01:51,444
It's important because imitating other media seems to be a natural, even maybe necessary

29
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:54,065
stage in every new medium's development.

30
00:01:54,065 --> 00:01:58,627
Building on a foundation provided by other media is pretty normal and natural.

31
00:01:58,627 --> 00:02:02,788
So I want to talk about how some other media have done this.

32
00:02:02,788 --> 00:02:04,209
I mean, movies started out...

33
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:13,211
emulating theater, of course. And here's an early Edison film starring the

34
00:02:13,211 --> 00:02:18,593
renowned John Irwin and May Rice reenacting something from their their

35
00:02:18,593 --> 00:02:25,695
show, which was quite the scandal at the time. Even as late as 1912, a lot of...

36
00:02:25,695 --> 00:02:26,015
whoops...

37
00:02:27,075 --> 00:02:29,836
A lot of filmmakers were still stuck in that,

38
00:02:29,836 --> 00:02:32,477
let's put the camera in the middle of the orchestra

39
00:02:32,477 --> 00:02:34,318
and just leave it there, because obviously that's

40
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:36,358
what movies are all about.

41
00:02:36,358 --> 00:02:38,919
This is Sarah Bernhardt in Queen Elizabeth, by the way.

42
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:43,761
It took a fair amount of time, a decade, even more than a decade

43
00:02:43,761 --> 00:02:47,523
after the creation of the earliest films

44
00:02:47,523 --> 00:02:50,704
before cinematic storytelling, as we know it today,

45
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:52,485
came into sort of widespread.

46
00:02:53,204 --> 00:02:57,388
use the techniques of cinematic storytelling.

47
00:02:57,388 --> 00:02:59,189
Radio as well. Radio borrowed

48
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:01,951
plenty in terms of

49
00:03:01,951 --> 00:03:04,813
bringing people from movies

50
00:03:04,813 --> 00:03:07,915
into radio and bringing radio

51
00:03:07,915 --> 00:03:08,976
stars into film. This is

52
00:03:08,976 --> 00:03:11,018
the Jack Benny show.

53
00:03:11,018 --> 00:03:14,641
I don't know why I come out here every show

54
00:03:14,641 --> 00:03:18,624
and I keep saying thank you, thank you, thank you.

55
00:03:18,624 --> 00:03:22,346
And look what I'm thanking you for.

56
00:03:23,486 --> 00:03:28,007
you get in here for nothing.

57
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:33,628
So, you know, and this is 12 Angry Men, television 1954,

58
00:03:33,628 --> 00:03:34,608
movie version 1957.

59
00:03:34,608 --> 00:03:37,069
You can see the similarities, I hope.

60
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:40,329
And given that I have 25 minutes, I'm going to stop here.

61
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:43,230
OK, so this has been going on for a while.

62
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:46,571
Every medium does it.

63
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:47,871
Maybe we should, too.

64
00:03:47,871 --> 00:03:48,831
But what about games?

65
00:03:48,831 --> 00:03:50,512
What does any of this have to do with game narrative?

66
00:03:51,841 --> 00:03:56,784
Now, this is a long quote. I hate doing that, but this is a pretty small book, first person.

67
00:03:56,784 --> 00:04:03,909
And the important part of this is video games include more of the building blocks of storytelling

68
00:04:03,909 --> 00:04:08,271
than any single medium has ever offered us. How could we not tell stories? And I totally

69
00:04:08,271 --> 00:04:13,194
get confused when people say, oh, games shouldn't tell stories. You know, it's crazy. I find

70
00:04:13,194 --> 00:04:19,097
that silly and amusing. But the seemingly simple statement that we — — —

71
00:04:19,867 --> 00:04:26,950
that we can tell stories because we combine all of these other media characteristics,

72
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,190
got me thinking, is that all we are?

73
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:35,594
Now, no medium has survived without changing and growing beyond its borrowed roots.

74
00:04:35,594 --> 00:04:39,295
And if we're nothing more than an amalgam of conventions borrowed from other media,

75
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,956
we're in a world of trouble.

76
00:04:40,956 --> 00:04:45,458
And is interactivity, then, the one thing we offer?

77
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:49,140
I mean, that's an abused word, almost as abused as transmedia.

78
00:04:51,104 --> 00:04:53,025
Not quite, but almost.

79
00:04:53,025 --> 00:04:55,367
Is that the only unique feature we have to offer?

80
00:04:55,367 --> 00:04:59,350
Are we just all these other media plus interactivity?

81
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:02,532
Now clearly, we can be movies with interactivity.

82
00:05:02,532 --> 00:05:05,174
And just before anybody gives me a hard time, these are my

83
00:05:05,174 --> 00:05:07,076
two favorite experiences of the last year.

84
00:05:07,076 --> 00:05:09,758
I came to Heavy Rain a little late.

85
00:05:09,758 --> 00:05:12,780
But I think we can do much more.

86
00:05:13,363 --> 00:05:14,904
than even these games are doing.

87
00:05:14,904 --> 00:05:20,506
What we have to do is understand how other media make meaning

88
00:05:20,506 --> 00:05:23,547
and adopt the conventions that work for us,

89
00:05:23,547 --> 00:05:25,768
but know enough about them to jettison

90
00:05:25,768 --> 00:05:28,769
the conventions and techniques that work against us.

91
00:05:28,769 --> 00:05:33,011
The key for me is to do this consciously,

92
00:05:33,011 --> 00:05:35,351
to understand why we borrow something

93
00:05:35,351 --> 00:05:38,993
and when we borrow something.

94
00:05:38,993 --> 00:05:42,474
And so I want to run through that very quickly.

95
00:05:43,082 --> 00:05:47,423
today. I'm going to talk mostly about movies and then go into some other media

96
00:05:47,423 --> 00:05:51,465
even more quickly. The similarities between movies and

97
00:05:51,465 --> 00:05:54,525
video games, as indicated by those, you know, my two favorite

98
00:05:54,525 --> 00:05:59,107
gaming experiences of the last year or so, it seems so obvious you're probably wondering

99
00:05:59,107 --> 00:05:59,267
why

100
00:05:59,267 --> 00:06:00,587
we should bother talking about it at all.

101
00:06:01,302 --> 00:06:03,784
They both, hey, they have moving images.

102
00:06:03,784 --> 00:06:04,624
We have moving images.

103
00:06:04,624 --> 00:06:07,706
They're projected or reflected on a screen.

104
00:06:07,706 --> 00:06:11,528
We both have color and synchronous sound.

105
00:06:11,528 --> 00:06:16,851
We both sort of create a convincing illusion of life.

106
00:06:16,851 --> 00:06:19,452
Formally, we share a lot of characteristics, obviously,

107
00:06:19,452 --> 00:06:20,173
movies and games.

108
00:06:20,173 --> 00:06:26,757
But they're the medium of the 20th century.

109
00:06:26,757 --> 00:06:30,199
And I can't even remember what I meant by United in real time.

110
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:30,999
That's pretty cool.

111
00:06:32,172 --> 00:06:37,098
Okay, anyway, I'm moving right along here.

112
00:06:37,863 --> 00:06:40,704
You know, I think what you can see is culturally speaking,

113
00:06:40,704 --> 00:06:43,385
we share a lot with movies as well, not just formally.

114
00:06:43,385 --> 00:06:46,886
The movies were the medium of the 20th century

115
00:06:46,886 --> 00:06:48,527
that changed everything.

116
00:06:48,527 --> 00:06:51,688
It was the first time that everybody in the world

117
00:06:51,688 --> 00:06:54,409
basically could experience the same stories,

118
00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:57,270
the same cultural messages at once.

119
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:00,791
Now clearly, movies and television still

120
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:02,992
fill that niche today.

121
00:07:02,992 --> 00:07:05,593
But I think everybody in this room will agree.

122
00:07:06,179 --> 00:07:13,904
Games have overtaken those earlier media with at least a new generation in reflecting and driving cultural norms.

123
00:07:13,904 --> 00:07:20,648
So clearly we are borrowing from movies and books and comics and other media.

124
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:28,473
And there are certainly similarities even in team makeup and development methodologies that I was going to talk about until I found out I only had 25 minutes.

125
00:07:29,778 --> 00:07:34,241
But there are also significant differences, and I think we ignore those at our peril.

126
00:07:34,241 --> 00:07:38,864
And so, let's talk a little bit about what some of those differences are.

127
00:07:38,864 --> 00:07:45,548
The ways in which filmmakers communicate, by cutting from one image to another, to give

128
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:50,351
the illusion of continuous action, while in fact breaking things down in ways that are

129
00:07:50,351 --> 00:07:54,794
more dreamlike than any reflection of the way we experience the real world.

130
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:59,956
And despite the success of cinematic games these days,

131
00:07:59,956 --> 00:08:03,978
and we all know and love cut scenes, don't we?

132
00:08:03,978 --> 00:08:05,139
All right, maybe not.

133
00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:09,421
I'd argue that even the most fundamental editing techniques,

134
00:08:09,421 --> 00:08:10,661
at some point, we're gonna go,

135
00:08:10,661 --> 00:08:13,302
what were we thinking, you know?

136
00:08:13,302 --> 00:08:13,903
They aren't for us.

137
00:08:13,903 --> 00:08:19,065
So I think we need to jettison some conventions.

138
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:21,086
See, I told you I was gonna start sounding like I was saying,

139
00:08:21,086 --> 00:08:22,247
don't make games like that.

140
00:08:23,329 --> 00:08:26,430
Okay, so here's an example of cross-cutting or parallel action.

141
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:31,072
I mean, it's as dirt simple as cinematic conventions come.

142
00:08:31,072 --> 00:08:35,133
The camera's cutting between multiple locations.

143
00:08:35,133 --> 00:08:38,014
The audience knows things that the characters don't.

144
00:08:39,555 --> 00:08:42,117
And it's the quintessential cinematic moment.

145
00:08:42,117 --> 00:08:45,380
Will he save the girl or not?

146
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:48,803
Films cut away from action that would

147
00:08:48,803 --> 00:08:53,107
reveal the artifice of what's going on in a scene.

148
00:08:53,107 --> 00:08:56,910
I was working with one director who I can't name out in LA.

149
00:08:57,851 --> 00:09:02,252
on a project that involved some fairly horrific scenes.

150
00:09:02,252 --> 00:09:06,113
And in the film version, the plan was going to be to...

151
00:09:06,113 --> 00:09:08,254
Okay, this was obviously not a Saw film or something,

152
00:09:08,254 --> 00:09:11,635
but we were gonna cut away from the really horrendous stuff.

153
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:14,276
But in the game, we had to figure out

154
00:09:14,276 --> 00:09:19,237
how to make that same stuff palatable and even enjoyable,

155
00:09:19,237 --> 00:09:20,898
which was quite the challenge,

156
00:09:20,898 --> 00:09:22,719
and why I made a Mickey Mouse game instead.

157
00:09:22,719 --> 00:09:26,260
And we had to make it not just...

158
00:09:27,599 --> 00:09:29,580
I can't believe I just said that.

159
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,421
Anyway, the viewers weren't just watching.

160
00:09:32,421 --> 00:09:35,403
They were actively engaged in the activity in real time.

161
00:09:35,403 --> 00:09:37,824
And not just once, but over and over and over again.

162
00:09:37,824 --> 00:09:40,225
That's something I'm going to come back to a lot.

163
00:09:40,225 --> 00:09:43,667
In a movie, this basic cinematic technique

164
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:44,768
is something that.

165
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:50,631
you know, everybody expects, everybody understands, it's a great way to invoke a specific emotion in a film.

166
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:56,055
But in contrast, when we're at our best, I think, this is, this should be unavailable to us.

167
00:09:56,055 --> 00:10:03,280
We should not be doing this. It breaks the illusion of immersion, which is critical, I think, to a game's success.

168
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:08,703
It wrests control away from players who want to be the directors of their own experience.

169
00:10:09,555 --> 00:10:13,298
Now, barring those cinematic films that, again, I love,

170
00:10:13,298 --> 00:10:15,340
please don't put me in a box of,

171
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,821
hey, he's the guy who hates cinematic movies,

172
00:10:16,821 --> 00:10:18,202
cinematic games.

173
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:20,984
But in most games, the action is continuous and contiguous.

174
00:10:20,984 --> 00:10:24,086
We either take full control of the camera ourselves,

175
00:10:24,086 --> 00:10:26,949
or we leave the player the work of determining

176
00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:28,430
where the camera looks

177
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,051
and what the hero sees or doesn't.

178
00:10:30,051 --> 00:10:32,553
And sometimes we do better with cameras than others, of course,

179
00:10:32,553 --> 00:10:34,714
and we're gonna move on from there.

180
00:10:34,714 --> 00:10:37,116
In a weird sort of way, movies are non-linear.

181
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:40,920
And games are linear in the way they treat time and space.

182
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,563
It's an interesting paradox and one we really need to remember.

183
00:10:43,563 --> 00:10:47,969
Now, just to bring that home, if there's a film historian in the crowd,

184
00:10:47,969 --> 00:10:49,931
I bet you can guess where I'm going with this.

185
00:10:49,931 --> 00:10:54,356
I want to take a look at two movies very quickly that...

186
00:10:55,884 --> 00:11:05,028
that take a very game-like approach, and you'll see how well it works.

187
00:11:05,028 --> 00:11:08,970
This is Rope, Alfred Hitchcock.

188
00:11:18,915 --> 00:11:19,315
He did!

189
00:11:19,315 --> 00:11:22,578
Oh, no, no, uh, this is, uh, you've made a mistake.

190
00:11:22,578 --> 00:11:24,240
This is Kenneth Lawrence.

191
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,101
Oh, I'm so sorry.

192
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,462
You see, that's all right.

193
00:11:26,462 --> 00:11:27,023
You're right.

194
00:11:27,023 --> 00:11:28,364
Kenny, there's nothing to mistake.

195
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,756
We'll get to this in a second.

196
00:11:31,756 --> 00:11:36,457
In Rope, Alfred Hitchcock was trying to make a game

197
00:11:36,457 --> 00:11:39,637
in one take, no cuts, no editing at all,

198
00:11:39,637 --> 00:11:40,377
just like games.

199
00:11:40,377 --> 00:11:42,138
And it was a disaster, okay?

200
00:11:42,138 --> 00:11:43,298
It's unwatchable.

201
00:11:43,298 --> 00:11:46,899
Similarly, I mean, that's a case of borrowing a convention.

202
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:50,239
Well, a convention he didn't even know was going to exist

203
00:11:50,239 --> 00:11:50,940
several years later.

204
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,760
But now, Lady and the Leg, Robert Montgomery's...

205
00:11:55,656 --> 00:11:57,457
big directorial debut and not a very successful one.

206
00:11:57,457 --> 00:12:01,379
Let's see if you can guess what game inventions this emulates.

207
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:02,979
You're a Yankee, you wouldn't understand.

208
00:12:02,979 --> 00:12:07,541
I don't think a little scheme is going to work.

209
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:10,403
Pardon me, Mr. Muller, do you have the time?

210
00:12:10,403 --> 00:12:14,284
What's the matter, doesn't your clock work either?

211
00:12:14,284 --> 00:12:23,568
Okay, you get the idea.

212
00:12:24,003 --> 00:12:30,507
Movies live and die on cinematic editing, go figure.

213
00:12:30,507 --> 00:12:35,890
And when they borrow, again, it's kind of a weird reverse borrowing,

214
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:39,192
but filmmakers very quickly figured out that doesn't work.

215
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:41,613
And I think the other direction works as well.

216
00:12:41,613 --> 00:12:43,634
We need to figure out what doesn't work.

217
00:12:44,735 --> 00:12:48,157
Now, there are three other differences that are worth citing here.

218
00:12:48,157 --> 00:12:54,020
The way games do their pacing is very different than movies.

219
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,461
And then, sorry, yeah, games and movies, right, I got that right.

220
00:12:56,461 --> 00:13:02,444
A movie, 90 minutes to 150 minutes, more or less.

221
00:13:02,444 --> 00:13:06,966
Games, 6 hours to infinite.

222
00:13:07,847 --> 00:13:15,178
You know, I remember I had a conversation with yet another filmmaker who I wish I could name, actually, but it was really cool, but I probably can't.

223
00:13:15,178 --> 00:13:24,551
We talked about his approach to cinematic storytelling, effective storytelling, and he was saying, let's take our time.

224
00:13:24,931 --> 00:13:29,252
let's have a normal world that the player explores

225
00:13:29,252 --> 00:13:31,173
and thinks it's perfectly fine,

226
00:13:31,173 --> 00:13:34,174
and then after half an hour, an hour,

227
00:13:34,174 --> 00:13:35,755
something strange happens.

228
00:13:35,755 --> 00:13:40,516
And you realize that that's a pretty standard

229
00:13:40,516 --> 00:13:42,177
cinematic technique.

230
00:13:42,177 --> 00:13:44,558
A filmmaker can count on an audience

231
00:13:44,558 --> 00:13:46,398
understanding how movies work

232
00:13:46,398 --> 00:13:49,099
and being willing to cut them the slack

233
00:13:49,099 --> 00:13:51,320
to sort of start in a normal world

234
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,101
because they know the action's going to come eventually.

235
00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:54,241
But...

236
00:13:55,047 --> 00:13:57,587
We don't have that advantage unless you're Hideo Kojima.

237
00:13:57,587 --> 00:14:03,649
We have to get players doing compelling, cool, fun,

238
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:08,790
action-y things in, what, 30 seconds, a minute, five

239
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,711
minutes, unless it's a free-to-play game, in which

240
00:14:10,711 --> 00:14:13,631
case they might play for half an hour.

241
00:14:13,631 --> 00:14:17,752
But if you don't get to your verbs quickly and make them

242
00:14:17,752 --> 00:14:22,534
really action-y, or at least compelling in some way, your

243
00:14:22,534 --> 00:14:24,114
player's going away.

244
00:14:24,932 --> 00:14:30,935
Another thing, in games and movies, there's a different approach to economical storytelling.

245
00:14:30,935 --> 00:14:35,237
Screenplay, what is it, 90 pages, 120 pages, a minute per page of screen time?

246
00:14:35,237 --> 00:14:42,960
Dialogue that reflects the way people actually talk, short snippets, frequent interruptions,

247
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,682
no incredibly long monologues.

248
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:50,974
Now, working with certain game writers

249
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:52,975
who I will not name,

250
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:56,918
I've had to take 50 pages of single-spaced monologue

251
00:14:56,918 --> 00:15:00,220
and say, no, no, no.

252
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:03,203
We can't adopt doorstop novels for inspiration.

253
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:08,447
This is a place where I think we can learn something

254
00:15:08,447 --> 00:15:09,968
from other media.

255
00:15:09,968 --> 00:15:10,448
But, I mean, this is...

256
00:15:10,448 --> 00:15:10,568
Whoops.

257
00:15:10,568 --> 00:15:13,250
Don't buy a computer a week before GDC.

258
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:19,764
that's a script for a movie on the left, and that is not a game script. But I can tell

259
00:15:19,764 --> 00:15:28,511
you for a fact, the script for a Deus Ex game is about that tall. Okay. From the, not from

260
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:33,015
the ground, I mean, you know, from the podium.

261
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:41,472
So, you know, the reason for that is it's not, well it's often that we just go on at some incredible length,

262
00:15:41,472 --> 00:15:48,894
but it's really that even in the simplest game, we have to make sure that the hero doesn't say the same things over and over again.

263
00:15:48,894 --> 00:15:52,235
Because remember, we're going to be repeating the same things over and over again.

264
00:15:52,656 --> 00:15:56,579
You're going to be interacting with non-player characters who are pretty damn stupid,

265
00:15:56,579 --> 00:15:57,480
which I'll get back to in a minute.

266
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,704
And you can't have them saying the same things over and over.

267
00:16:01,704 --> 00:16:05,427
So you have to find a hundred ways to say,

268
00:16:05,427 --> 00:16:07,289
I thought I heard something.

269
00:16:07,289 --> 00:16:11,433
And of course, there are branching narratives and all that stuff that we all know about.

270
00:16:11,433 --> 00:16:15,597
But the illusion of immersion is instantly lost if you don't have

271
00:16:15,597 --> 00:16:18,720
a hundred ways to say what a screenwriter can say just once.

272
00:16:20,784 --> 00:16:25,409
But here's the coolest thing I discovered working with a bunch of guys in Hollywood.

273
00:16:25,409 --> 00:16:32,097
They think about wonderful moments in a way that we can't.

274
00:16:32,097 --> 00:16:37,464
They think in terms of one-shot character behavior, set pieces, memorable bits of business.

275
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:39,326
I was working with John Woo.

276
00:16:39,912 --> 00:16:44,873
on a project. And I'll never forget this conversation. We were talking about the character that we

277
00:16:44,873 --> 00:16:52,095
were creating for a movie and a game simultaneously. And this guy, he leaped out of his chair and

278
00:16:52,095 --> 00:17:00,317
started, with the movements of a dancer, started acting out the coolest thing I've ever imagined

279
00:17:00,317 --> 00:17:01,198
a character doing.

280
00:17:02,177 --> 00:17:07,280
And I was determined that I was going to find a way to use it in the game somewhere.

281
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,142
But I had to explain to this guy, one of my heroes,

282
00:17:10,142 --> 00:17:14,265
the first time the player does that, it's going to be really cool.

283
00:17:14,265 --> 00:17:17,427
The hundredth time, not so much.

284
00:17:17,427 --> 00:17:21,590
The first time doves fly in front of the camera.

285
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:26,954
It's really cool. Once a movie, you can get away with it. If every time a gun goes off,

286
00:17:26,954 --> 00:17:30,617
doves start flying, people are going to start laughing. And similarly, you know, like flying

287
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:35,321
down a staircase while shooting. I mean, it's cool once, but if you're doing it a hundred times,

288
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:38,504
it really gets silly, you know? It's not cool.

289
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:41,145
Now, we do have magic moments.

290
00:17:41,145 --> 00:17:48,388
These are some of my favorites, and I'm dating myself, I know, but, you know, stuff starts

291
00:17:48,388 --> 00:17:52,569
reaching out and grabbing guys and pulling them, you know, down into the depths of who

292
00:17:52,569 --> 00:17:53,730
knows where.

293
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:56,633
dogs leap out and surprise you.

294
00:17:56,633 --> 00:18:00,879
But those work, I think, because these games,

295
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:02,741
well, we'll get to what kind of games those are.

296
00:18:02,741 --> 00:18:04,403
They work for very specific reasons

297
00:18:04,403 --> 00:18:08,129
and not in ways that I think are really valuable to us.

298
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:09,430
What's really valuable to us...

299
00:18:10,011 --> 00:18:15,152
is when we allow players to make the magic moments.

300
00:18:15,152 --> 00:18:17,713
They're about repeated actions.

301
00:18:17,713 --> 00:18:20,013
Games are about repeated actions,

302
00:18:20,013 --> 00:18:22,374
where their significance and coolness

303
00:18:22,374 --> 00:18:26,615
comes from the context, from what the player decides to do.

304
00:18:26,615 --> 00:18:28,555
Even the coolest bit of business becomes a bore

305
00:18:28,555 --> 00:18:29,956
when it's enacted over and over again.

306
00:18:29,956 --> 00:18:33,717
OK, so real quick, I want to talk about some other media.

307
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:40,423
I bet if I asked you guys who had played Dungeons and Dragons, a lot of hands would go up.

308
00:18:40,423 --> 00:18:43,486
How many people have played Dungeons and Dragons?

309
00:18:43,486 --> 00:18:44,767
Yeah, okay.

310
00:18:44,767 --> 00:18:52,033
If I asked you who read or, let's even say it now, who reads comic books?

311
00:18:52,033 --> 00:18:53,054
Yeah, okay.

312
00:18:53,054 --> 00:18:56,577
Anybody not watch television?

313
00:18:56,577 --> 00:18:58,398
Holy cow, you guys are weird.

314
00:19:00,214 --> 00:19:03,835
Okay, classic radio probably not so much,

315
00:19:03,835 --> 00:19:08,457
and oral storytelling, yeah, right, okay.

316
00:19:08,457 --> 00:19:12,298
But I actually think there's a lot we can learn from this.

317
00:19:12,298 --> 00:19:16,100
But before I get to that, I want everybody to take a second

318
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:19,101
and turn towards Lake Geneva, Wisconsin.

319
00:19:19,101 --> 00:19:22,002
Oh my God, you're kidding me, I have five minutes left?

320
00:19:22,002 --> 00:19:23,823
Holy cow, I'm halfway through my talk.

321
00:19:23,823 --> 00:19:27,424
We will be continuing this outside.

322
00:19:27,424 --> 00:19:27,724
Okay.

323
00:19:30,228 --> 00:19:35,372
Okay, really ripping. Say a prayer of thanks to, uh, to, yeah, Gary and Dave.

324
00:19:35,372 --> 00:19:39,655
Okay, so there are a lot of things we can learn, uh, about collaborative storytelling.

325
00:19:39,655 --> 00:19:43,958
Uh, that's the coolest thing. The, the recognition that player expression and creativity are

326
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:49,643
what, what makes tabletop role-playing cool. There's no way I'm finishing in four minutes.

327
00:19:49,643 --> 00:19:50,463
It's not gonna happen.

328
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:56,407
Okay, sharing just that realization, like letting players drive the story.

329
00:19:56,407 --> 00:19:58,889
If we had nothing else, we'd be great.

330
00:19:58,889 --> 00:20:01,771
But these are things that I think we don't want to learn.

331
00:20:01,771 --> 00:20:08,636
I mean, D&D is, and role-playing ever since, has been about, you know, guys who look like

332
00:20:08,636 --> 00:20:12,078
the mighty Thor and real big broadswords.

333
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:15,660
I mean, they're kind of adolescent in their behavior and stuff.

334
00:20:17,093 --> 00:20:21,217
You know, we don't want to emulate what a couple of war gamers in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin,

335
00:20:21,217 --> 00:20:23,278
in a basement of the library, thought was cool.

336
00:20:23,278 --> 00:20:23,678
Okay?

337
00:20:23,678 --> 00:20:27,741
I mean, we are the first medium that's come along in, like, 50 years.

338
00:20:27,741 --> 00:20:29,863
We owe ourselves better.

339
00:20:29,863 --> 00:20:33,205
We don't want to make games that are about rolling dice.

340
00:20:33,205 --> 00:20:36,468
How many games, even today, are about secret die rolls?

341
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:37,829
We have better tools.

342
00:20:38,149 --> 00:20:44,457
We can actually simulate what a door is and how it responds to a big sword or a shotgun.

343
00:20:44,457 --> 00:20:48,602
Why would you freaking roll dice to simulate that?

344
00:20:48,602 --> 00:20:51,285
It's ridiculous.

345
00:20:51,285 --> 00:20:52,867
We don't have a human game master.

346
00:20:52,867 --> 00:20:56,351
That's a huge problem for us, which I will come back to in the one minute I have left.

347
00:20:58,437 --> 00:21:01,820
Okay, so these are the important lessons we should absolutely not learn.

348
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,622
Radio we're just not going to talk about, okay?

349
00:21:03,622 --> 00:21:07,305
Except to say, audio is really important to games.

350
00:21:07,305 --> 00:21:10,487
No matter how good our graphics get, we're still in the, you know, making them.

351
00:21:10,487 --> 00:21:13,670
Oh my gosh, well bye George. I ain't going to take this thing lying down.

352
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:15,011
I got proof for all my figures.

353
00:21:15,011 --> 00:21:18,174
I got receipts for all my tax deductions filed away.

354
00:21:18,174 --> 00:21:18,794
Where?

355
00:21:18,794 --> 00:21:19,975
Right here in the hall closet.

356
00:21:19,975 --> 00:21:21,456
What? The hall closet?

357
00:21:21,456 --> 00:21:23,959
I've got to, I'll get them out and sort through them.

358
00:21:23,959 --> 00:21:26,441
Oh no, don't open that door, McGee.

359
00:21:27,978 --> 00:21:31,279
Everybody knew what happened when Fibber McGee opened that closet.

360
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:32,679
Forget it, it's not happening for you.

361
00:21:32,679 --> 00:21:34,939
You're going to have to drag me off the stage.

362
00:21:34,939 --> 00:21:36,580
Okay, what about comics?

363
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:41,681
Economical storytelling, I mean, those guys get more bang for their word buck

364
00:21:41,681 --> 00:21:43,961
than even the screenwriters do.

365
00:21:43,961 --> 00:21:47,882
There's a little bit of interaction if you've read understanding comics.

366
00:21:47,882 --> 00:21:52,263
I mean, the amount of information that players have to provide, sorry,

367
00:21:52,263 --> 00:21:56,964
readers have to provide in the gutter there is huge.

368
00:21:57,638 --> 00:22:02,283
And they understand the importance of iconic presentation of information and characters.

369
00:22:02,283 --> 00:22:08,370
What we shouldn't get, though it's clear that we can learn something from In the Shadow of No Towers,

370
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:12,655
on the right there, you can deal with adult material, and I think we could learn from that.

371
00:22:13,129 --> 00:22:17,230
But we probably don't want to deal with what a lot of comics

372
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:19,391
deal with, sort of kiddy stuff.

373
00:22:19,391 --> 00:22:20,551
OK, oral storytelling.

374
00:22:20,551 --> 00:22:23,172
This is the part I really am going to rip through this,

375
00:22:23,172 --> 00:22:25,813
because I do not understand this at all.

376
00:22:25,813 --> 00:22:28,054
My gut is telling me that there's

377
00:22:28,054 --> 00:22:30,694
something about the way a storyteller interacts

378
00:22:30,694 --> 00:22:33,495
with the people listening to the story that

379
00:22:33,495 --> 00:22:34,436
is really valuable to us.

380
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,216
And I've been thinking about it for a year,

381
00:22:36,216 --> 00:22:37,857
and if any of you know, please tell me.

382
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:37,917
OK?

383
00:22:39,172 --> 00:22:43,356
But, you know, it's an interactive art that encourages the listener's imagination.

384
00:22:43,356 --> 00:22:44,557
I mean, it's pretty crazy.

385
00:22:44,557 --> 00:22:51,143
We are working in a medium that's about collaborating with our players to tell a story.

386
00:22:51,143 --> 00:22:55,927
So we are dangerously similar, as I've been saying for years, to other media.

387
00:22:55,927 --> 00:23:00,792
If you take a superficial look at what we do, it's very much like these other media,

388
00:23:00,792 --> 00:23:04,215
but there's a point where we have to start looking at what makes us unique.

389
00:23:04,973 --> 00:23:11,537
The four things that I think make us unique, we can transport players to worlds that they

390
00:23:11,537 --> 00:23:16,179
can only imagine. It's not Luke Skywalker in a ship, it's you, right? We can immerse

391
00:23:16,179 --> 00:23:20,421
you in worlds that seem like they're real, okay? We can remove the obstacles the player

392
00:23:20,421 --> 00:23:25,884
believe. We are the only medium in history, think about this, the only medium in history

393
00:23:25,884 --> 00:23:31,807
that can respond to what players do. No one's ever been able to do that in the entire history

394
00:23:31,807 --> 00:23:33,848
of humankind except maybe LARPers.

395
00:23:34,494 --> 00:23:35,195
And they don't care.

396
00:23:35,195 --> 00:23:41,760
And we're the only medium that I can think of that it's not

397
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:47,644
happening, that can prize the repeated action.

398
00:23:47,644 --> 00:23:50,346
Everything else depends on the unique moment.

399
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:54,589
OK, so when we're at our best, these are the things that I

400
00:23:54,589 --> 00:23:56,771
think we need to be doing to take the next

401
00:23:56,771 --> 00:23:57,832
step in our evolution.

402
00:23:59,402 --> 00:24:01,643
Players interact with the game world in real time.

403
00:24:01,643 --> 00:24:03,844
They're offered significant opportunities to act.

404
00:24:03,844 --> 00:24:07,767
They are shown the consequences of those actions.

405
00:24:07,767 --> 00:24:09,728
And the game responds appropriately

406
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:13,410
to create a unique experience at the end of the day.

407
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,551
Player experience comes first.

408
00:24:14,551 --> 00:24:16,092
OK, so in my description, I promised.

409
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:21,842
In my description, I promised that I would leave

410
00:24:21,842 --> 00:24:24,203
with some specific recommendations

411
00:24:24,203 --> 00:24:25,303
for research topics.

412
00:24:25,303 --> 00:24:27,564
I'm going to do that very quickly.

413
00:24:27,564 --> 00:24:29,905
Okay, story structures.

414
00:24:29,905 --> 00:24:30,905
We suck.

415
00:24:30,905 --> 00:24:35,466
We have five approaches that I can think of.

416
00:24:35,466 --> 00:24:38,828
The roller coaster that no matter how well-hidden it is,

417
00:24:38,828 --> 00:24:42,369
and I think both of those games hide it exceptionally well,

418
00:24:43,827 --> 00:24:46,509
you're really, the only choice you're getting to make is,

419
00:24:46,509 --> 00:24:47,529
do I jump here or not?

420
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:50,931
Do I, what gun do I use to kill that thing?

421
00:24:50,931 --> 00:24:53,392
It looks complicated, but that's the illusion.

422
00:24:53,392 --> 00:24:54,433
It's really one, two, three, four, five.

423
00:24:54,433 --> 00:24:55,953
There's the retold story.

424
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:58,114
I can't believe somebody talked about sports before.

425
00:24:58,114 --> 00:24:58,995
That was so cool.

426
00:24:58,995 --> 00:25:00,836
There's the retold story.

427
00:25:00,836 --> 00:25:04,658
Man, I was waiting for that long, straight piece,

428
00:25:04,658 --> 00:25:06,879
and oh my God, it never came, and it sucked.

429
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,262
The retold story is really powerful to the person telling it.

430
00:25:11,262 --> 00:25:13,544
It's probably very boring to the person listening,

431
00:25:13,544 --> 00:25:17,407
but it's a very powerful tool for us,

432
00:25:17,407 --> 00:25:19,388
and we shouldn't make fun of it, actually.

433
00:25:19,388 --> 00:25:24,772
There's the sandbox where the only story is what you create.

434
00:25:24,772 --> 00:25:28,015
It's not the, he's walking away, I won.

435
00:25:29,382 --> 00:25:31,404
There's no predetermined narrative at all.

436
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:36,249
There's the hybrid, where you still have 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

437
00:25:36,249 --> 00:25:39,092
Guess what? These are the games that I make.

438
00:25:39,092 --> 00:25:41,134
And lots of other people are making them now, too.

439
00:25:41,134 --> 00:25:44,458
But how you navigate that first part of the story is up to you.

440
00:25:44,458 --> 00:25:47,761
How you navigate the second part of the story.

441
00:25:47,761 --> 00:25:51,025
And to be frank, that's the best I can think of, which is pathetic.

442
00:25:51,496 --> 00:25:53,116
We have to find a better answer.

443
00:25:53,116 --> 00:25:56,257
Procedural stuff, there are a bunch of experiments

444
00:25:56,257 --> 00:25:59,438
that have been going on for about 10 years,

445
00:25:59,438 --> 00:26:00,578
maybe a little longer.

446
00:26:00,578 --> 00:26:02,459
They've worked in very small cases,

447
00:26:02,459 --> 00:26:05,860
but not really in any big stuff.

448
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,401
You know, they point us in interesting directions, though.

449
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:10,681
I think we need some new structures, okay?

450
00:26:10,681 --> 00:26:12,602
New hybrids, whatever.

451
00:26:12,602 --> 00:26:15,042
I mean, if we fail, I think we end up the bastard stepchild

452
00:26:15,042 --> 00:26:16,903
of every other medium on the planet.

453
00:26:16,903 --> 00:26:18,123
That's research project number one.

454
00:26:18,766 --> 00:26:19,866
Number two, virtual actors.

455
00:26:19,866 --> 00:26:22,228
I mean, how do you tell stories?

456
00:26:22,228 --> 00:26:25,669
You have interesting characters to interact with.

457
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:28,010
We're doing better on the character graphics front, I

458
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:31,172
think, but that's all we seem to focus on,

459
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:32,072
the prettier pictures.

460
00:26:32,072 --> 00:26:35,474
Clearly, we've made progress, right?

461
00:26:35,474 --> 00:26:37,275
But not enough.

462
00:26:37,275 --> 00:26:40,036
I had to work to find these three examples of anything

463
00:26:40,036 --> 00:26:42,477
better than what we were doing 10 years ago, except for

464
00:26:42,477 --> 00:26:43,157
prettier pictures.

465
00:26:43,157 --> 00:26:46,139
This is what the mainstream press, for crying out loud, is

466
00:26:46,139 --> 00:26:46,959
saying about us.

467
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:50,366
Characters remain primitive and flat.

468
00:26:50,366 --> 00:26:54,711
When non-gamers figure that out, we're in trouble.

469
00:26:54,711 --> 00:26:59,956
And when interaction models haven't changed since 1990,

470
00:26:59,956 --> 00:27:02,299
we've got to work harder, you know?

471
00:27:02,299 --> 00:27:04,421
We've got to work harder.

472
00:27:04,421 --> 00:27:07,925
I mean, the coolest thing we've done is we've attached a timer

473
00:27:07,925 --> 00:27:10,207
to branching conversation systems.

474
00:27:10,207 --> 00:27:10,487
Jesus.

475
00:27:11,445 --> 00:27:13,726
I mean, we've got to do better than this.

476
00:27:13,726 --> 00:27:16,707
We have to focus a little bit on non-combat AI.

477
00:27:16,707 --> 00:27:19,008
I get in so much trouble with programmers when I say this.

478
00:27:19,008 --> 00:27:20,188
Oh my god.

479
00:27:20,188 --> 00:27:23,409
But we spend so much time figuring out pathfinding

480
00:27:23,409 --> 00:27:26,490
and not having characters fall into holes in the ground

481
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:28,170
and stuff like that.

482
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:30,851
And how do we outflank the enemy?

483
00:27:30,851 --> 00:27:35,693
We spend no time on going to the women's bathroom

484
00:27:35,693 --> 00:27:38,213
and having people notice.

485
00:27:38,213 --> 00:27:40,654
People still walk up to me and say, wow, that was cool.

486
00:27:40,894 --> 00:27:41,994
That was 13 years ago.

487
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:45,715
Have you ever seen a game where a drink was spilled

488
00:27:45,715 --> 00:27:48,216
and a character responded appropriately?

489
00:27:48,216 --> 00:27:48,516
I think not.

490
00:27:48,516 --> 00:27:52,177
Have you ever seen a game where there was a spurned lover

491
00:27:52,177 --> 00:27:55,078
that mattered, that wasn't just a movie

492
00:27:55,078 --> 00:27:57,379
masquerading as a game?

493
00:27:57,379 --> 00:28:00,619
Have you ever seen a game where there was a would-be lover

494
00:28:00,619 --> 00:28:02,800
that you could interact with and actually impact?

495
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,000
Oh yeah, I can make a one, actually.

496
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,481
Okay, anyway, but that's all stupid hard,

497
00:28:06,481 --> 00:28:07,821
and we need to do more of that.

498
00:28:08,504 --> 00:28:10,085
We need to create sets.

499
00:28:10,085 --> 00:28:11,966
That's the next, that's a separate research topic

500
00:28:11,966 --> 00:28:14,607
that I'm hoping someone will do.

501
00:28:14,607 --> 00:28:17,308
We need to start creating sets, not worlds.

502
00:28:17,308 --> 00:28:20,769
I mean, how many games can you just go into every room

503
00:28:20,769 --> 00:28:25,271
and have something interesting happen?

504
00:28:25,271 --> 00:28:25,371
Zero.

505
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:25,671
Yeah, okay.

506
00:28:25,671 --> 00:28:26,732
There you go.

507
00:28:28,842 --> 00:28:30,663
We need to give players the opportunity

508
00:28:30,663 --> 00:28:32,685
to actually go where they want and do what they want.

509
00:28:32,685 --> 00:28:35,128
If anybody knows how to create a virtual game master,

510
00:28:35,128 --> 00:28:38,331
you know, I mean, it's sort of like putting me

511
00:28:38,331 --> 00:28:40,853
in a box or something, you know, or you in a box.

512
00:28:40,853 --> 00:28:43,055
That would be really cool.

513
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:44,977
We've been talking about this since 1989

514
00:28:44,977 --> 00:28:47,479
at Junction Point, Looking Glass, Ion Storm, Junction,

515
00:28:47,479 --> 00:28:48,680
I mean, everywhere.

516
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,922
You know, and we still haven't done it.

517
00:28:50,922 --> 00:28:52,863
But, you know, good stories are constructed.

518
00:28:52,863 --> 00:28:54,063
They're not found.

519
00:28:54,063 --> 00:28:57,085
Emergence can only get you so far.

520
00:28:57,085 --> 00:29:00,467
And if we can dynamically modify stories based on what

521
00:29:00,467 --> 00:29:03,188
players want to do, I mean, like, in a good D&D campaign,

522
00:29:03,188 --> 00:29:06,470
you want to screw with the game master.

523
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:08,551
You know, no, I'm not fighting.

524
00:29:08,551 --> 00:29:09,792
I'm not going to do it.

525
00:29:09,792 --> 00:29:12,093
And the game master actually responds.

526
00:29:12,093 --> 00:29:13,534
I mean, that's what we need to be doing.

527
00:29:13,992 --> 00:29:21,084
And that's what I mean. I want to see a game system that does that okay summing up for all the people who are mad at me now

528
00:29:21,084 --> 00:29:23,208
You know

529
00:29:24,475 --> 00:29:25,956
We've come a long way, obviously.

530
00:29:25,956 --> 00:29:28,157
I mean, I've been talking a lot about the ways in which we're

531
00:29:28,157 --> 00:29:29,718
similar, the ways in which we shouldn't be similar,

532
00:29:29,718 --> 00:29:30,159
and all that.

533
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:32,080
We've come a really long way.

534
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:36,682
I remember the days when people would get up on stage here

535
00:29:36,682 --> 00:29:39,804
at GDC and say, story doesn't matter except in movies.

536
00:29:39,804 --> 00:29:41,785
It doesn't matter in games and pornography.

537
00:29:41,785 --> 00:29:46,448
And I haven't heard the words, Warren, you're not allowed to

538
00:29:46,448 --> 00:29:49,409
say the word story ever again in a long time.

539
00:29:49,409 --> 00:29:50,810
OK, so we've made progress.

540
00:29:51,271 --> 00:29:55,255
And we can get partway to where I think we are capable of going as a medium

541
00:29:55,255 --> 00:29:58,199
by borrowing from other media, by studying them and stealing from them.

542
00:29:58,199 --> 00:30:03,846
But we can only go so far. We need some original ideas, tough problems solved.

543
00:30:03,846 --> 00:30:07,050
The ones that I put up here are the ones that I care about.

544
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:10,314
And I wish I had answers to any of them, but I don't,

545
00:30:10,314 --> 00:30:12,256
which is what's cool and fun.

546
00:30:12,256 --> 00:30:13,898
You have the opportunity, even now,

547
00:30:13,898 --> 00:30:16,581
30 years after the creation of this medium,

548
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:18,122
you have the opportunity to determine

549
00:30:18,122 --> 00:30:19,104
what it's going to become.

550
00:30:19,104 --> 00:30:21,346
You can change the world, okay?

551
00:30:21,346 --> 00:30:22,347
It's not too late.

552
00:30:22,347 --> 00:30:24,329
And I challenge all of you to beat me

553
00:30:24,329 --> 00:30:25,931
to the solutions to those problems.

554
00:30:25,931 --> 00:30:27,373
Good luck. Thanks.
