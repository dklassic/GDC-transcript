00:00:05,297 --> 00:00:08,318
Hey everyone. My name is Alex Lehman. I'm an art director at

2
00:00:08,338 --> 00:00:11,080
Riot Games and welcome to the first ever Tricks of the Trade

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,102
Talk. As I said, I work at Riot Games. I get to work on League

4
00:00:15,122 --> 00:00:18,623
of Legends which is amazing. In my career as an animator I

5
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:21,005
worked anywhere from commercials to feature film and now in

6
00:00:21,025 --> 00:00:23,246
games. And I'm going to be your host today.

7
00:00:24,347 --> 00:00:26,750
Left and right of me you see an amazing panel of animators

8
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,234
and they're gonna share tricks that really made a difference

9
00:00:29,254 --> 00:00:31,657
in their career and the goal is that these tricks

10
00:00:31,717 --> 00:00:33,680
are applicable to your work tomorrow.

11
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,163
You can go home and immediately try them out.

12
00:00:36,644 --> 00:00:38,987
So what is the Tricks of the Trade talk all about?

13
00:00:40,028 --> 00:00:43,070
You know, I always wanted to have a talk that's full of these nuggets.

14
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:47,553
You know, where you just come to the talk and you get all these wonderful nuggets that you can try out the next day.

15
00:00:47,633 --> 00:00:50,174
Because we as an industry are a pretty young industry.

16
00:00:50,694 --> 00:00:52,995
Games in general is a couple of decades old, right?

17
00:00:53,476 --> 00:00:55,517
And animation in games is even younger.

18
00:00:55,537 --> 00:00:57,778
And we're all still learning.

19
00:00:58,378 --> 00:01:00,219
We're sharing all this information.

20
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,020
And we thought, hey, you know what?

21
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,562
By us sharing our tricks, hopefully you will share your tricks with us.

22
00:01:05,882 --> 00:01:08,724
And then we get some really cool tricks that we can take home, too.

23
00:01:09,264 --> 00:01:11,507
So if you have a good trick afterwards, please approach us

24
00:01:11,567 --> 00:01:14,250
and let us know about it. And then as an industry as a whole,

25
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,974
we hopefully turn into this awesome animation beast that we

26
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:20,998
can be. Okay, cool. How does it work? Well, simple. Six

27
00:01:21,038 --> 00:01:24,062
panelists, right? Each of us is going to present three tricks.

28
00:01:24,863 --> 00:01:27,006
And that means for the sake of time we really got to book it.

29
00:01:27,997 --> 00:01:33,140
Okay? So for you, here are a couple of tricks to get the most out of it. Don't worry about

30
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:38,883
taking notes. Just enjoy the ride. If you want to look back, just go to the GDC vault and then

31
00:01:38,923 --> 00:01:44,887
you can frame by frame it. And with that being said, I'm going to start us off with our first

32
00:01:44,907 --> 00:01:45,307
three tricks.

33
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,953
So when I started out and switched from feature film to

34
00:01:53,073 --> 00:01:56,615
game animation, I wish I had known this one. This is how I

35
00:01:56,655 --> 00:02:00,038
did one of my first animations. So this is a character set in

36
00:02:00,058 --> 00:02:03,120
the game League of Legends and I started out in a pose A and I

37
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:07,243
hit my hit frame pose B and I go back into A. And sure enough,

38
00:02:07,303 --> 00:02:11,285
this is boring, bland, repetitive. But I see it time and

39
00:02:11,306 --> 00:02:15,228
again in a lot of games that people do this. It's actually

40
00:02:15,248 --> 00:02:16,109
pretty easy to fix.

41
00:02:17,367 --> 00:02:23,793
all you have to do is you have to find your C. Now C is actually this one pose where you

42
00:02:23,853 --> 00:02:28,877
tell the story of the character. C is what makes this character completely unique. How

43
00:02:29,078 --> 00:02:34,903
heavy was the punch? How high was the jump? This is actually pretty easy to find out and

44
00:02:35,143 --> 00:02:36,084
here we see it in action.

45
00:02:37,626 --> 00:02:41,008
Both of these loops are 45 frames long, so they have the same length.

46
00:02:41,608 --> 00:02:46,070
And on the left side you see a very repetitive blend between A, B and A.

47
00:02:46,551 --> 00:02:48,172
On the right side you see the A, B, C, A.

48
00:02:48,232 --> 00:02:50,253
And this is unique. This is Z.

49
00:02:50,413 --> 00:02:52,574
Only Z is attacking this way in our game.

50
00:02:52,934 --> 00:02:57,977
And it makes it really easy for us to find character in the animation.

51
00:02:58,037 --> 00:03:00,539
So the next time you work on a loop, find your C.

52
00:03:02,466 --> 00:03:06,709
responsive animations. Working on a game like League of Legends means that the moment a

53
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:10,973
player hits a button you immediately want a reaction on the screen. So how do you do that? I

54
00:03:11,113 --> 00:03:16,137
want to share two small tricks for that. The first one is that I learned you don't need a long

55
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:16,477
blend.

56
00:03:16,837 --> 00:03:20,042
like my first blends were like 7, 10, 12 frames, didn't work

57
00:03:20,122 --> 00:03:24,588
out. It's not fun. Actually I will show a two frame blend in a

58
00:03:24,649 --> 00:03:27,753
second. So if you are starting out in game animation, you know,

59
00:03:28,114 --> 00:03:32,039
feel free to cut into your animations. You'll be surprised

60
00:03:32,119 --> 00:03:33,061
what you can get away with.

61
00:03:34,482 --> 00:03:37,384
The second one is something that at first made no sense when I

62
00:03:37,424 --> 00:03:40,747
learned it. And that is that we put the anticipation at the end

63
00:03:40,847 --> 00:03:44,289
of the cycle. So this is how it works. The player hits the

64
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:48,112
button. Immediately we fire off the arrow. And then the

65
00:03:48,152 --> 00:03:51,194
anticipation to put up a new arrow. Now this is what happens

66
00:03:51,234 --> 00:03:54,436
in the player's mind. The player sees, oh, he put up a new arrow.

67
00:03:54,536 --> 00:03:57,658
Well, I guess next time you can fire it off immediately. It is

68
00:03:57,718 --> 00:04:00,180
actually a mind trick that works really well. Let's look at that

69
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:00,880
in animation.

70
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,881
in motion. So here's my two frame blend and the anticipation

71
00:04:05,921 --> 00:04:12,604
is at the end. See it again. There's the two frame blend and

72
00:04:12,624 --> 00:04:15,666
then the anticipation is at the end. So the next time you have

73
00:04:15,686 --> 00:04:19,087
to work on a very repetitive animation, not repetitive, a

74
00:04:19,127 --> 00:04:21,708
very responsive animation, I highly recommend that you try it

75
00:04:21,768 --> 00:04:24,069
out to put the anticipation at the end and you see what you can

76
00:04:24,089 --> 00:04:24,590
get away with.

77
00:04:27,456 --> 00:04:32,879
Okay, trick number three. I was working on howling abyss which is a map in our game and I had to

78
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:37,682
animate these simulated, these chains so I started simulating them because they were falling

79
00:04:37,722 --> 00:04:43,426
down into the abyss. Pretty complicated stuff. And that leads to very dense motion data. This

80
00:04:43,466 --> 00:04:48,108
works by the way also for motion capture. The problem is that this doesn't loop, right? You

81
00:04:48,128 --> 00:04:51,851
can't, the first frame and the last frame are not the same. So what do you do about it?

82
00:04:52,551 --> 00:04:57,095
Well, there's something that's called animation layers in pretty much every piece of software,

83
00:04:57,275 --> 00:05:03,060
but most of us use Maya, where you take all the controls and you set a key on frame number one,

84
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:08,945
and you middle mouse drag it to the last frame, and you set another key. If you do that, then over

85
00:05:09,005 --> 00:05:13,809
time, Maya will blend into its own pose again. Let's look at that in motion.

86
00:05:15,685 --> 00:05:20,269
Here we go. So on the left side you see the simulated loop that came out of simulation and there's

87
00:05:20,309 --> 00:05:24,713
clearly a hitch. On the right side you see it blends into itself. This took me about 30

88
00:05:25,674 --> 00:05:31,059
seconds. So next time you have to deal with motion capture data or dense animation data and you

89
00:05:31,099 --> 00:05:36,024
want to loop it, use animation layers. Okay. With that being said, those were my first three

90
00:05:36,064 --> 00:05:38,966
tricks and I'm handing it over to Simon Unger.

91
00:05:45,518 --> 00:05:53,841
I apologize. Hey, everybody. I'm Simon. I am from Phoenix labs. So for my first one I want to

92
00:05:53,861 --> 00:05:58,622
talk about force. So often in animation reviews we hear things like an animation doesn't have

93
00:05:58,642 --> 00:06:03,904
enough weight, it's not powerful enough. Instead I find it easier to talk about force and

94
00:06:03,944 --> 00:06:08,246
inertia. A character doesn't change direction if they don't apply force in the opposite

95
00:06:08,286 --> 00:06:10,226
direction. For example,

96
00:06:12,342 --> 00:06:17,945
character here, a foot contacting the ground, pushes up through the legs, alters the

97
00:06:18,305 --> 00:06:24,229
rotation of the hips, the spine, the arms, legs, it all kind of works down from there. If you

98
00:06:24,269 --> 00:06:28,912
watch this clip, it plays awesome. Watch how the center of mass is being redirected when the

99
00:06:28,952 --> 00:06:34,856
legs come out in front of it, apply force in the opposite direction and influence its inertia.

100
00:06:36,651 --> 00:06:38,773
if you think about how your current gameplay character

101
00:06:39,213 --> 00:06:42,976
works, it likely doesn't happen this way. This same thing can be

102
00:06:43,016 --> 00:06:46,658
applied to lifting a heavy object or a light object. The

103
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:50,121
amount of force being applied in a specific direction implies

104
00:06:50,221 --> 00:06:54,063
weight. We know from this image the boxes are light because

105
00:06:54,424 --> 00:06:57,386
nothing in his pose is really communicating force or anything

106
00:06:57,426 --> 00:07:01,609
being applied to oppose gravity. Broken lines of action like this

107
00:07:01,709 --> 00:07:05,131
sort of communicate relaxed muscles and very little effort.

108
00:07:05,572 --> 00:07:06,092
On the other hand

109
00:07:06,971 --> 00:07:10,734
showing extreme weight requires communicating a lot of force

110
00:07:10,774 --> 00:07:14,837
being exerted. All of these lines of actions are support

111
00:07:14,897 --> 00:07:18,841
those opposing forces. Keeping this in mind when animating or

112
00:07:18,901 --> 00:07:21,403
even just providing feedback and throw that into your language

113
00:07:21,423 --> 00:07:22,223
and into your tool kit.

114
00:07:24,073 --> 00:07:28,597
My second one. Use metrics for focus iteration. No matter how

115
00:07:28,637 --> 00:07:30,939
big your animation team is, it's always a challenge to figure

116
00:07:30,979 --> 00:07:34,141
out how to use your development time effectively. When you're

117
00:07:34,161 --> 00:07:36,303
planning to focus your animation work and where your team is

118
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:39,966
going to work, letting data do a lot of that leg work for you.

119
00:07:40,607 --> 00:07:43,669
Getting metrics on which animations get played a lot or a

120
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:47,072
little in entirety or not at all, it's quickly going to

121
00:07:47,112 --> 00:07:49,034
generate a priority list for you on your team.

122
00:07:50,808 --> 00:07:54,331
lot of times the 80-20 principle applies here. 20% of your

123
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:58,935
animations get seen 80% of the time. Make that 20% awesome and

124
00:07:59,495 --> 00:08:04,139
it will significantly improve the perceived fidelity of your

125
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:07,942
stuff. The other 80% shouldn't be crap, but if you only have a

126
00:08:07,982 --> 00:08:10,524
limited time for polish, that 20% is where you really want to

127
00:08:10,544 --> 00:08:10,624
go.

128
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:16,928
is handy when you're retargeting or reusing animation sets for

129
00:08:16,948 --> 00:08:19,869
different characters such as a male set for a female set.

130
00:08:20,169 --> 00:08:22,951
Typically you can get away with replacing only about 20% of that

131
00:08:23,071 --> 00:08:26,512
and you will have a female set or an injured set or whatever.

132
00:08:27,933 --> 00:08:31,258
If you don't have access to metrics or the programming help

133
00:08:31,298 --> 00:08:34,982
to mine those, there are analog ways to do this. Try filming

134
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:38,247
people playing your game, making note of which animations get

135
00:08:38,307 --> 00:08:40,690
played the most and which ones you rarely see, how people are

136
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:43,674
interacting with your game and pick out the most commonly

137
00:08:43,694 --> 00:08:44,175
played moves.

138
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,751
Another method is to think of your game in concentric rings.

139
00:08:48,272 --> 00:08:51,834
In the center of that is the target or core of your game.

140
00:08:52,694 --> 00:08:54,936
Does the player need to capture the flag and return it to the

141
00:08:54,976 --> 00:08:57,697
base? Then running and capturing the flag is your 20%. The

142
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:02,080
opposite side of that, defensive moves attached to that are

143
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,982
probably live in that. But player celebrations when they

144
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:07,423
capture the flag probably live outside of that and don't need

145
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:11,206
as much polish. This also applies to other areas of the

146
00:09:11,226 --> 00:09:11,846
game. UI, oops.

147
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:24,827
Oh, no. What happened? Sorry. It's not going back. There we go.

148
00:09:26,782 --> 00:09:30,884
This also applies to other areas like audio, UI, effects,

149
00:09:30,964 --> 00:09:33,445
everything. All the stuff attached to that core, the wind

150
00:09:33,505 --> 00:09:36,407
condition, the target of your game, that 20% needs to be

151
00:09:36,847 --> 00:09:39,989
polished to a T. Everything else you can spend a little bit less

152
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:42,991
time on. Number three, head movement is more important than

153
00:09:43,011 --> 00:09:46,673
hip movement. Most character rigs use the hips as a top node

154
00:09:46,693 --> 00:09:49,034
controller while for subtle moves this is okay.

155
00:09:49,874 --> 00:09:52,275
broader stuff, this creates a very strange fulcrum point for

156
00:09:52,295 --> 00:09:56,197
your character. This becomes worse in games. We use a ground

157
00:09:56,237 --> 00:09:59,698
node for a lot of times blending for characters and that fulcrum

158
00:09:59,738 --> 00:10:02,960
point becomes even more exaggerated. You can see this in

159
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:15,445
action here. When my video stops. Is it loading? How about

160
00:10:15,485 --> 00:10:18,786
Christian's talk? There it goes. So I'm going to talk about

161
00:10:20,251 --> 00:10:32,115
Oh, no. It skipped it. There we go. My video is too big. No.

162
00:10:35,848 --> 00:10:38,510
There we go. So here you can see it in action. Character change

163
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:40,352
in direction. You can see where that fulcrum point is being

164
00:10:40,392 --> 00:10:42,334
applied on the ground. We're getting that erratic sort of

165
00:10:42,414 --> 00:10:46,337
head movement. Most living things have evolved a very

166
00:10:46,397 --> 00:10:50,181
complex chain of stabilizing mechanisms to stabilize

167
00:10:50,341 --> 00:10:55,005
eyesight for fight or flight situations. We are sort of in a

168
00:10:55,085 --> 00:10:58,248
sideways way used to seeing things move that way.

169
00:10:59,094 --> 00:11:02,559
When anything breaks that we dip really sharply into the uncanny

170
00:11:02,599 --> 00:11:05,342
valley. So if you think of any time you've seen maybe a crowd

171
00:11:05,382 --> 00:11:08,627
character change direction sharply or a CG character in a

172
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:12,191
film suddenly realize it was very CG, chances are some erratic

173
00:11:12,231 --> 00:11:14,074
head movement was a part of that.

174
00:11:15,772 --> 00:11:18,773
great example of a step in the right direction. This little

175
00:11:18,813 --> 00:11:21,555
clip that was on Twitch from Paragon, you can see how they're

176
00:11:21,575 --> 00:11:25,297
sort of getting that, the legs out and trying to change that

177
00:11:25,377 --> 00:11:28,379
inertia, keeping the head kind of very steady. Again, sort of

178
00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:33,602
combining that use of force and steady head movement. And next

179
00:11:36,823 --> 00:11:41,486
So place a higher priority on that. Track your arcs, track your head. And how you blend

180
00:11:41,526 --> 00:11:46,108
between animations because ultimately our goal as animators is to make the character look like

181
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:51,050
it moved, not like it was moved. And next we have Amy.

182
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:06,079
I'm going to try to make this as quick as possible. I'm probably going to read. I've been

183
00:12:06,099 --> 00:12:12,725
in animator for 21 years now. Working starting off in feature film on 2D animated films. Now

184
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:17,910
I'm in gaming and fully enjoying it. So let me move on.

185
00:12:18,973 --> 00:12:26,159
here we go. So being asked to bring in what I think about when

186
00:12:26,219 --> 00:12:30,062
I'm animating, a lot of the things that I bring in is

187
00:12:30,162 --> 00:12:34,406
obviously from the 2D background. These examples right

188
00:12:34,446 --> 00:12:38,349
now, the smears, help show the illusion of motion.

189
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:42,351
And I find that, like, you know, sometimes you get into a point where you get strobing or

190
00:12:42,391 --> 00:12:51,133
staggering. How do we bring this into 3D? So smears and multiples bridge the gas, bridge the

191
00:12:51,173 --> 00:12:56,874
space between the gaps of slower frame rates. Without them, the viewer sees empty spaces that

192
00:12:56,934 --> 00:13:00,775
cause strobing during playback. This helps maintain fluidity even though it breaks the

193
00:13:00,815 --> 00:13:05,296
volume of the character. So next slide.

194
00:13:06,534 --> 00:13:09,436
breaking it again. Now here is real time. You might say to

195
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:12,398
yourself, okay, how does this apply to realistic characters?

196
00:13:12,938 --> 00:13:16,120
Much more than you think. Biology allows for some drastic

197
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,502
adaptations to movement needed in the most intense situations,

198
00:13:19,863 --> 00:13:23,525
be them repetitive or immediate. Working with limited or complex

199
00:13:23,605 --> 00:13:26,287
rigs, we can get stifled with maintaining the beauty of the

200
00:13:26,327 --> 00:13:29,729
mesh. Perfect poses and lack of deformation equals uncanny

201
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:33,011
valley. Sloppy is sometimes better.

202
00:13:34,195 --> 00:13:38,137
Like a moving hold, even the most subtle irregularity adds

203
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:38,498
life.

204
00:13:38,878 --> 00:13:41,399
Embrace adapting your keys to the motion you're creating,

205
00:13:41,499 --> 00:13:43,160
or your animation can be stiff.

206
00:13:44,801 --> 00:13:45,481
All right.

207
00:13:46,702 --> 00:13:47,742
Let's move on.

208
00:13:48,983 --> 00:13:49,483
There we go.

209
00:13:49,981 --> 00:13:53,224
Here is an example of breaking it in real time,

210
00:13:54,565 --> 00:13:56,206
pulling that character around.

211
00:13:56,266 --> 00:13:57,748
Now, this is all hand-key animation,

212
00:13:58,168 --> 00:13:59,769
but it's applied in a 3D sense.

213
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:02,752
So you see really a lot of that pulling and pushing

214
00:14:02,812 --> 00:14:03,452
and stretching.

215
00:14:04,974 --> 00:14:08,417
It really lends itself to the feeling of the motion.

216
00:14:08,517 --> 00:14:12,640
If I did not include this, you'd still have the impact moment.

217
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,941
You'd still have some of the weight.

218
00:14:14,382 --> 00:14:16,023
But this really just makes.

219
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:20,285
it read better. In some instances it makes it more

220
00:14:20,305 --> 00:14:29,429
enjoyable to see. So tip number two, keeping track of arcs. So

221
00:14:29,489 --> 00:14:33,051
this is really quick and dirty in Maya. It's the edible motion

222
00:14:33,091 --> 00:14:36,352
trail. Whenever I do walk cycles or run cycles, I have a tendency

223
00:14:36,392 --> 00:14:39,874
to really do the contrapposto poses during passing. So I

224
00:14:39,914 --> 00:14:44,596
really get that hip and shoulder access moving around. That has

225
00:14:44,636 --> 00:14:45,656
a tendency to...

226
00:14:47,437 --> 00:14:50,199
this technique will show me whether or not my head is

227
00:14:50,239 --> 00:14:53,381
bobbling too much really quickly and it can also show me the

228
00:14:53,421 --> 00:14:56,362
subtlety of where things are going a little bit off track.

229
00:14:57,603 --> 00:15:03,546
All right. Next. Again, edible motion trails. Just to keep

230
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:07,889
really quickly to look at the arcs of motion in action like a

231
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:14,713
sword swipe or just general movement arcs in arms, legs and

232
00:15:14,753 --> 00:15:15,593
planting motions.

233
00:15:16,596 --> 00:15:20,258
So these can be memory hogs. I suggest you turn everything off

234
00:15:20,478 --> 00:15:23,781
when you're working with them. You can also turn the key frames

235
00:15:23,821 --> 00:15:26,282
so you don't see the actual key frames being marked on the line

236
00:15:26,322 --> 00:15:30,565
like in this example. Just to keep your memory going. But it's

237
00:15:30,605 --> 00:15:32,226
a quick check method that I use.

238
00:15:33,728 --> 00:15:36,570
that's not really dependent on making anything specific.

239
00:15:37,371 --> 00:15:40,913
Lastly, I've got a simple block in and layer example.

240
00:15:41,534 --> 00:15:44,035
So to just bring it down to a simple level,

241
00:15:44,055 --> 00:15:45,176
I just used a cape.

242
00:15:45,616 --> 00:15:48,138
So basically, I'm going through and I'm setting key frames,

243
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:51,340
about four key frames on this, just

244
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,382
to get the idea of the base motion in one axis.

245
00:15:55,764 --> 00:16:00,909
Then what I do is I select, let's see here, there we go.

246
00:16:02,091 --> 00:16:03,372
Then I select the lower bones,

247
00:16:04,353 --> 00:16:06,215
and just for a quick block in technique,

248
00:16:06,836 --> 00:16:10,480
I just drag those key frames down the timeline

249
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,383
to offset them, and voila.

250
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:17,753
you've got a little bit of instant overlap. I find that

251
00:16:17,793 --> 00:16:20,656
this is, again, this is really for the block-in process. So to

252
00:16:20,716 --> 00:16:23,858
add a little bit more complexity to that base movement, I go into

253
00:16:23,878 --> 00:16:28,862
layers and I just basically select the bones on each line,

254
00:16:28,922 --> 00:16:33,446
on each edge of the cape. And just adjust them, again, using

255
00:16:33,506 --> 00:16:37,849
two middle frames. Just pulling those around to make that

256
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:39,611
cupping shape.

257
00:16:42,515 --> 00:16:44,757
And then I move on to do the next.

258
00:16:45,017 --> 00:16:48,901
I do another key frame to kind of pull that fluff up

259
00:16:49,682 --> 00:16:51,244
at the end, create that shape.

260
00:16:51,264 --> 00:16:54,267
And then voila.

261
00:17:04,894 --> 00:17:06,495
you've got overlap and follow through.

262
00:17:07,075 --> 00:17:10,699
And this block in took just under four minutes to do.

263
00:17:10,879 --> 00:17:15,503
So really quick way of running through and doing overlap

264
00:17:15,543 --> 00:17:16,043
and follow through.

265
00:17:16,063 --> 00:17:17,765
This can also be applied to other chains that

266
00:17:17,825 --> 00:17:19,507
have major overlap and follow through.

267
00:17:19,587 --> 00:17:21,208
It doesn't have to be just a cape.

268
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:25,031
So another thing is when you're going through layers, like in

269
00:17:25,071 --> 00:17:29,634
this, especially in this method, you use smart bake. Because

270
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:33,037
otherwise it will bake everything. But other than that,

271
00:17:34,017 --> 00:17:38,100
that should be it. Yes. So that's all, folks.

272
00:17:40,282 --> 00:17:48,148
Thank you. All right. Hello, everybody.

273
00:17:49,158 --> 00:17:52,701
I am an animator at ILM. My name is JD. Been there for 12 years.

274
00:17:53,142 --> 00:17:56,665
And these are my tips that you will hopefully like. So first

275
00:17:56,806 --> 00:18:01,190
off, we do a lot with CG shots and live action shots. Handheld

276
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:04,534
camera stuff is very important. So in order to be consistent

277
00:18:04,554 --> 00:18:07,537
with live action shots and CG shots, you want to add

278
00:18:09,052 --> 00:18:12,553
hiccups and hand held imperfections in your cameras.

279
00:18:12,573 --> 00:18:15,654
For that I have a very simple thing. So you have your camera

280
00:18:15,674 --> 00:18:18,875
set up that could be layers or how are you going to do it with

281
00:18:18,935 --> 00:18:23,216
nodes. And usually I do six or eight or 12, every six or eight

282
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:28,117
or 12 frames I set a key on the X and Y rotation channels. And

283
00:18:28,157 --> 00:18:32,138
then you do separate rotations. X and Y are different. Then you

284
00:18:32,158 --> 00:18:35,279
take the Y rotation, move it over by three frames and then

285
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:38,220
you have an organic overlap so the peaks are not on the same

286
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:38,480
frame.

287
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:42,641
you do that and then you can have, you know, if you have a

288
00:18:42,681 --> 00:18:46,481
static camera, get a bit more wavy, a bit more exaggerated, a

289
00:18:46,621 --> 00:18:49,782
bit more subtle. You can put that in layers for shake, you

290
00:18:49,802 --> 00:18:53,223
can give it some flavor if you have a car drive by for

291
00:18:53,243 --> 00:18:57,444
imperfections on the car. Or if you do something on a bigger

292
00:18:57,484 --> 00:19:03,105
shot you can do full on handheld for POV stuff. You can go into

293
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:06,866
action mode if it's a camera track to a chopper or just

294
00:19:06,926 --> 00:19:07,746
general handheld.

295
00:19:08,557 --> 00:19:10,987
Just keep it a bit alive and not so CG.

296
00:19:12,663 --> 00:19:16,024
second one is blur. So a lot of times live action we have a lot

297
00:19:16,064 --> 00:19:19,425
of crazy action shots where stuff is always moving all the

298
00:19:19,465 --> 00:19:23,866
time. It's very confusing. Gets on your nerves. So what you can

299
00:19:23,906 --> 00:19:27,506
do is you can artificially slow down certain elements where you

300
00:19:27,526 --> 00:19:30,567
can say at this point I want to see the face a bit better. So on

301
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:33,727
the left always moving, always blurry. On the right I slowed it

302
00:19:33,747 --> 00:19:37,808
down just a bit here for the guy's eyes. You can do this on

303
00:19:37,988 --> 00:19:38,708
fangs, on

304
00:19:39,489 --> 00:19:44,815
claws on facial expressions anything that's a specific story point or emotion and that way you

305
00:19:44,855 --> 00:19:48,699
can guide the audience tell them now you saw this is important and now we can move on.

306
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:55,624
Next one is act it out, sound it out. That's for me as a general reference point when I want to

307
00:19:55,684 --> 00:20:00,867
check the timing of my animation. So if I do a play blast I act out what I see in the play

308
00:20:00,887 --> 00:20:06,191
blast exactly what I see. Not what I think it should be doing but what you exactly see. So if

309
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:10,694
it's something too slow or too fast you will feel it, it will feel wrong. But it's a bit tricky

310
00:20:10,714 --> 00:20:14,877
because you might have creatures, might have a dragon, something that flies around, you can't

311
00:20:14,897 --> 00:20:19,261
really do it. So a lot of times I just sound it out. So you can have a guy that.

312
00:20:19,901 --> 00:20:25,804
trips and falls. You just do over and over. You sound like an

313
00:20:25,844 --> 00:20:28,665
idiot but you do it over and over. You have that reference

314
00:20:28,705 --> 00:20:31,426
that timing in your ear. You do your play blast. You make that

315
00:20:31,466 --> 00:20:33,987
sound. You check it with your play blast. If it's off, you're

316
00:20:34,007 --> 00:20:37,869
wrong. Or you record yourself, put that into Maya and then

317
00:20:37,989 --> 00:20:42,611
reference that sound file as a general guide for reference.

318
00:20:49,232 --> 00:20:53,318
or you can use music. So whatever you want will be okay.

319
00:20:53,338 --> 00:20:55,280
So next up, that's Billy. Thank you very much.

320
00:20:55,300 --> 00:21:04,313
It's playing.

321
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:08,404
awesome. That's me. And guys, you got to forgive me because I

322
00:21:08,464 --> 00:21:11,749
am freaking out. This is so cool. Look at this panel. Look

323
00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:15,816
at the fact that this is happening. I don't know what to

324
00:21:15,856 --> 00:21:19,021
think. So we're just going to jump right into it.

325
00:21:20,982 --> 00:21:22,923
Trick number one, simple retargeting.

326
00:21:23,443 --> 00:21:27,104
So there's lots of times in mocap where you get the data

327
00:21:27,725 --> 00:21:29,986
and you have to wait for it to be processed,

328
00:21:30,046 --> 00:21:31,226
wait for it to be retargeted.

329
00:21:32,266 --> 00:21:34,587
And at Sucker Punch, we always try

330
00:21:34,607 --> 00:21:37,508
to get stuff from the volume into the game

331
00:21:37,548 --> 00:21:38,569
as quickly as possible.

332
00:21:38,949 --> 00:21:42,670
So a lot of the methods surround that.

333
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:48,373
So I found that you can actually go and take your animation

334
00:21:48,393 --> 00:21:54,255
and just take the mocap data and then pick one or two frames

335
00:21:54,295 --> 00:21:55,856
where the registration points happen

336
00:21:56,136 --> 00:21:58,136
for different characters, different sizes,

337
00:21:59,037 --> 00:22:01,758
and that actually will retarget the animation

338
00:22:01,838 --> 00:22:02,598
very effectively.

339
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:05,579
Let's see, is it gonna play automatically?

340
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:06,900
Awesome.

341
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:11,962
So here is just normal portion character.

342
00:22:13,392 --> 00:22:19,194
super human character. And just going through finding the key

343
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:24,437
registration points. Posing out the character on a different

344
00:22:24,457 --> 00:22:35,682
layer. And then there it is. Retargeted. Cool. So here's

345
00:22:35,702 --> 00:22:39,444
another thing for clean up data. I don't know if anybody here is

346
00:22:39,484 --> 00:22:41,805
familiar with Mirai. It's an old school. Yeah.

347
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:49,132
All two of you. That's awesome. So I'm kind of like, I'm an old

348
00:22:49,172 --> 00:22:53,033
school guy. So one thing that Mariah did really well is it

349
00:22:53,113 --> 00:22:56,674
actually had the ability for you to plot out your motion and then

350
00:22:56,914 --> 00:23:00,675
just attach IK to that and do the clean up through the curves

351
00:23:00,815 --> 00:23:05,777
themselves. I know that there's the motion trails that you can

352
00:23:05,857 --> 00:23:09,218
use, editable motion trails. This is a trick with motion

353
00:23:09,318 --> 00:23:09,698
paths.

354
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:18,692
which is a bit more responsive. And all I'm doing is taking the

355
00:23:18,752 --> 00:23:22,874
animation that had a hitch in it and going through and attaching

356
00:23:22,914 --> 00:23:28,857
a curve on attaching a CV on each of the key frame, key

357
00:23:28,897 --> 00:23:35,200
frames and then attaching my IK to that curve. And saying a key

358
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,061
on each of the frames on the motion path itself.

359
00:23:40,113 --> 00:23:42,994
And then from there, it's really quick and responsive to go

360
00:23:43,034 --> 00:23:47,635
through and just clean everything up in 3D along the

361
00:23:47,675 --> 00:23:48,355
path itself.

362
00:23:49,355 --> 00:23:52,756
And another method, another thing that this is really good

363
00:23:52,796 --> 00:23:56,817
for is if we have multiple characters, multiple people

364
00:23:56,857 --> 00:23:59,017
that are acting on a mocap stage, and we want to make sure

365
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:02,098
that they stay attached properly, and the data is like

366
00:24:02,198 --> 00:24:05,698
dense data that comes in from the stage, it's really easy to

367
00:24:05,738 --> 00:24:09,239
clean it up really very quickly using this method as well.

368
00:24:12,486 --> 00:24:13,989
And you just get rid of the curve.

369
00:24:15,592 --> 00:24:16,574
And now it's cleaned up.

370
00:24:18,257 --> 00:24:18,618
All right.

371
00:24:19,239 --> 00:24:19,660
Last one.

372
00:24:21,864 --> 00:24:22,365
Fresh eyes.

373
00:24:23,674 --> 00:24:26,196
Everybody, you know, you want to get critiques.

374
00:24:26,577 --> 00:24:28,298
You want other people to look at your stuff.

375
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:31,581
And the main reason for that is it's a fresh look.

376
00:24:31,601 --> 00:24:33,863
Like you're looking at something looping over and over and over

377
00:24:33,923 --> 00:24:37,186
again, and you kind of like lose your objectivity,

378
00:24:37,687 --> 00:24:38,628
and it gets a little stale.

379
00:24:38,688 --> 00:24:41,370
So what you can do is one thing I

380
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:44,553
like to do to kind of see the animation with fresh eyes

381
00:24:44,593 --> 00:24:47,776
myself is just play blast it backwards

382
00:24:48,176 --> 00:24:50,258
and watch your animation in reverse.

383
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:57,120
Another trick is in Maya, just hit the 7 key so the lights all

384
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,141
go out and just look at the silhouette of your character.

385
00:25:00,741 --> 00:25:04,883
You combine both of these and you really get some good

386
00:25:04,923 --> 00:25:10,444
results and it's kind of like a neat cheap way of getting fresh

387
00:25:10,524 --> 00:25:15,506
eyes on it. Now I will hand over the stage to Jay.

388
00:25:23,304 --> 00:25:26,187
Hey guys, I'm Jay Hossfeldt, lead animator at Epic Games.

389
00:25:26,588 --> 00:25:28,030
Currently working on Paragon.

390
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:31,453
And we are hiring animators, so find me for a business card.

391
00:25:31,714 --> 00:25:34,797
All right, so I've been working in games for about 20 years.

392
00:25:34,837 --> 00:25:37,500
So a couple of my tips kind of deal with how animation

393
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,421
integrates into games.

394
00:25:39,142 --> 00:25:40,043
So first tip.

395
00:25:41,792 --> 00:25:45,654
is so Brad Clark from rigging dojo showed me this. It's an

396
00:25:45,714 --> 00:25:50,615
amazing technique to pull out animation from dense data,

397
00:25:50,635 --> 00:25:53,136
whether it's mocap or it's just baked down animation for

398
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:53,757
whatever reason.

399
00:25:55,785 --> 00:25:58,287
in the past I would take one of these animations and start

400
00:25:58,327 --> 00:26:01,510
deleting keys. The keys I felt I didn't need. And you end up

401
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:06,534
with this manageable key framing animation system. So what you do

402
00:26:06,614 --> 00:26:11,418
here is you set a new layer with all your controls. Set it to

403
00:26:11,558 --> 00:26:15,482
override. Set that weight down to zero so you see what your

404
00:26:15,542 --> 00:26:16,903
first layer is doing.

405
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,882
And with all your controls selected,

406
00:26:18,902 --> 00:26:21,444
just go through and key the poses you want,

407
00:26:21,484 --> 00:26:25,367
like the contact points, some of your key poses.

408
00:26:25,988 --> 00:26:31,273
Then if you go back, set that layer back to one,

409
00:26:31,453 --> 00:26:34,115
and you can see the new keys you set on that top override layer,

410
00:26:34,395 --> 00:26:35,576
you can now see the new animation

411
00:26:35,597 --> 00:26:38,319
you created based off that dense data or that mocap data.

412
00:26:39,504 --> 00:26:42,266
and so you can sit there and go back and forth and rinse and

413
00:26:42,306 --> 00:26:45,308
repeat and kind of fine tune this animation and the whole

414
00:26:45,348 --> 00:26:49,591
time you have that untouched mocap or dense data on your base

415
00:26:49,611 --> 00:26:52,993
layer to always reference. So this drastically changed our

416
00:26:53,013 --> 00:27:00,457
pipeline on our project. We use this a lot. And so here I'm

417
00:27:00,517 --> 00:27:03,039
going back, you know, making adjustments because that first

418
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:08,943
part looked a little swimmy. And this can be used on, you know,

419
00:27:09,701 --> 00:27:11,862
blending to new animations, you can bring in new animations on

420
00:27:11,882 --> 00:27:19,528
layer zero. Next tip is so on Paragon in many games in the

421
00:27:19,568 --> 00:27:23,351
past we've had a restriction of melee moves or reloads need to

422
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:27,313
be upper body only. Start at spine one. But what this does is

423
00:27:27,353 --> 00:27:30,395
it really separates spine one from the hips and it looks

424
00:27:30,435 --> 00:27:33,277
pretty ugly. But it works for game play design. It makes it

425
00:27:33,297 --> 00:27:37,921
responsive. But I didn't want to settle for this on Paragon. So

426
00:27:37,981 --> 00:27:38,181
I was

427
00:27:38,827 --> 00:27:43,790
looking at what we had in the anim set. And we had the

428
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:46,732
strafes like a lot of games have the run right, run left, run

429
00:27:46,772 --> 00:27:49,534
forward, run back. So I took those same assets, didn't have

430
00:27:49,574 --> 00:27:55,478
to create new ones and just put an offset. Let me hit play here.

431
00:27:59,681 --> 00:28:02,022
So if you see the video on the right, I'm using those same four

432
00:28:02,062 --> 00:28:05,324
animations but I'm using the root rotation to offset it so

433
00:28:05,344 --> 00:28:07,766
that way all four strafes actually still keep him running

434
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:08,586
in the same direction.

435
00:28:10,485 --> 00:28:14,287
It's very hard to see. It's very swimmy. Can you guys tell what's

436
00:28:14,307 --> 00:28:17,610
going on? So same four strafe animations but now you can see

437
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:20,432
his hips have the ability to swivel right and left even

438
00:28:20,452 --> 00:28:24,315
though he's running the same direction. And so combine that

439
00:28:24,455 --> 00:28:28,417
with the upper body animations for swings and you can see here

440
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:32,200
now the hips play a little nicer with the upper body. So

441
00:28:33,219 --> 00:28:36,420
course you can go on and add additive and whatever to make

442
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,221
this even better. But it's just a cool kind of cheap technique

443
00:28:39,461 --> 00:28:43,882
to make that feel a little better. And trick number three.

444
00:28:44,382 --> 00:28:47,723
So this is something I've seen new animators when they come in

445
00:28:47,743 --> 00:28:49,964
and start working on games. They're told by programmers,

446
00:28:50,004 --> 00:28:52,865
like, hey, your animations, they're running forward, you

447
00:28:52,885 --> 00:28:58,666
need to have them run in place. And I've seen exporters and or

448
00:28:58,706 --> 00:29:01,027
animators just straight up delete that forward motion

449
00:29:01,047 --> 00:29:01,267
curve.

450
00:29:02,668 --> 00:29:06,250
And so they end up with something like this. And it looks correct. It's running in place.

451
00:29:06,531 --> 00:29:13,014
Run looks good. It loops. Whatever. That's actually incorrect. What you want to do is here's

452
00:29:13,054 --> 00:29:18,697
this forward motion curve. It looks like a linear straight path. But it's really not. So what

453
00:29:18,717 --> 00:29:23,039
you do is you subtract what the game is going to add to it, which is linear distance over time.

454
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:29,943
You can put that on a layer or put it on an offset node. And what you'll see is once you

455
00:29:30,023 --> 00:29:30,483
subtract.

456
00:29:31,528 --> 00:29:33,770
that you actually still have some nice forward and back

457
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:38,435
motion on your hips. And it adds that texture to the run forward

458
00:29:38,475 --> 00:29:41,138
motion. And it helps your characters not feel so linear

459
00:29:41,178 --> 00:29:43,701
when they're running forward and you get that nice natural motion.

460
00:29:44,322 --> 00:29:46,784
It works even better on characters that limp or might

461
00:29:46,824 --> 00:29:52,090
have like a kind of a stutter in their step. And that's going to

462
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:52,771
pass it back to Alex.

463
00:29:59,858 --> 00:30:02,120
Like I said, this is the first time we've ever done this.

464
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,742
And this is also the first time we ever stayed under 30 minutes.

465
00:30:04,822 --> 00:30:08,025
That means we have one more minute to run through some speed tips,

466
00:30:08,085 --> 00:30:11,088
because there were some tips that we had that we couldn't fit into the talk.

467
00:30:11,408 --> 00:30:14,711
we're 18 so far so we're going to try that. By the way, if you

468
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,793
like this format, if you think this is a really good idea,

469
00:30:16,913 --> 00:30:19,255
please vote for it or give us feedback. Let us know what was

470
00:30:19,315 --> 00:30:21,917
good, what was bad about it and we'll think about it if we ever

471
00:30:21,937 --> 00:30:25,521
bring this back. But speed round, okay? Some crazy tricks

472
00:30:25,561 --> 00:30:28,704
that didn't make it into the talk. Speed tip number one, I

473
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:31,146
learned this from an animator at Dreamworks, it blew my mind.

474
00:30:31,786 --> 00:30:34,529
Body language 8 out of 10 times precedes VO.

475
00:30:35,309 --> 00:30:37,851
study some video reference. You will see that people shake their

476
00:30:37,871 --> 00:30:41,433
head before they say no or they nod and before they say yes.

477
00:30:41,793 --> 00:30:44,194
Whereas animators most of the time animate that at the same

478
00:30:44,234 --> 00:30:49,337
time. Speed tip number two. Who is next? Quick.

479
00:30:51,231 --> 00:30:53,734
So we see a lot about motion trails, tracking arcs and stuff.

480
00:30:53,774 --> 00:30:55,657
Sometimes those are really heavy, cumbersome in a scene. I

481
00:30:55,677 --> 00:30:57,619
like to sometimes just throw just a straight piece of

482
00:30:57,659 --> 00:31:00,042
geometry in the scene to use as reference, especially if you're

483
00:31:00,062 --> 00:31:03,826
trying to get track compound arcs like an arm swinging a

484
00:31:03,886 --> 00:31:05,748
hammer, you can track the elbow, the arm and everything along

485
00:31:05,788 --> 00:31:09,492
like a circle attached to the character and using that to

486
00:31:09,612 --> 00:31:10,173
unify arcs.

487
00:31:12,558 --> 00:31:15,740
So even if you have an item picker sometimes it's faster to

488
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:19,203
just do a hockey press and release. So it's on G on my

489
00:31:19,223 --> 00:31:22,164
pinky. So it's nerves control is on off to quickly see the

490
00:31:22,204 --> 00:31:28,628
controller, select them, adjust the pose and move on. Okay. Bone

491
00:31:28,648 --> 00:31:28,909
chains.

492
00:31:31,232 --> 00:31:34,854
Usually bone chains seem like dangly bits, claws, ponytails,

493
00:31:34,894 --> 00:31:39,838
whatever. Bones equal distance. You can get just as good of an

494
00:31:39,858 --> 00:31:42,520
effect if not better from using the golden ratio spacing of the

495
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,202
bones. Because as you can see on that chain reference, a lot of

496
00:31:45,262 --> 00:31:50,206
the cool curvature happens at the tip. Speed to number five.

497
00:31:50,446 --> 00:31:52,828
Put it in the game. Don't spend too much time in Maya. Put it in

498
00:31:52,868 --> 00:31:54,509
the game. Please, please put it in the game.

499
00:31:59,818 --> 00:32:02,261
learn to code. I'm not saying become a programmer but just

500
00:32:02,582 --> 00:32:05,525
learning a few quick scripts, some things like Python has

501
00:32:05,545 --> 00:32:07,507
probably been the most valuable thing I've learned in the last

502
00:32:07,547 --> 00:32:11,612
year. Start with something simple and like I tried to solve

503
00:32:12,673 --> 00:32:15,917
moving animation from a selected object on to a locator and back

504
00:32:15,957 --> 00:32:18,480
again and then just move on to more complex things.

505
00:32:22,198 --> 00:32:25,660
tracking arcs, two dry erase markers, one color and you

506
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:28,062
track every frame, the control of the nose, the hand or

507
00:32:28,082 --> 00:32:30,583
whatever and you can see what's wrong, where is it popped, take

508
00:32:30,603 --> 00:32:32,984
the second controller, retrace it where it's supposed to be,

509
00:32:33,424 --> 00:32:35,405
reanimate it and if it's not your screen even better.

510
00:32:37,567 --> 00:32:39,468
Okay, sometimes you want to bring in an animation from

511
00:32:39,528 --> 00:32:42,329
another file to preview or look at reference in your file and

512
00:32:42,369 --> 00:32:46,451
rather than import a heavy rig just export out a limbic GPU

513
00:32:46,471 --> 00:32:48,672
cache of the animation scene, bring it into your file and you

514
00:32:48,712 --> 00:32:49,353
can spin around it.

515
00:32:52,125 --> 00:32:54,849
speed tip number nine, rotoscoping is not a bad word.

516
00:32:54,909 --> 00:32:57,392
It's actually a really great tool to learn complex body

517
00:32:57,432 --> 00:32:59,816
motion. This is a 13 second animation that took me eight

518
00:32:59,836 --> 00:33:03,201
hours and I learned a shit ton doing it. So next time just try

519
00:33:03,241 --> 00:33:04,963
something out. If you're a student, try rotoscope

520
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,886
something. Don't put it on your reel but learn a lot from it.

521
00:33:10,713 --> 00:33:16,420
So the six to eight frames at the very beginning of the shot is when an audience will understand

522
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,604
your shot, will understand the characters and geography and everything. So don't put anything

523
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:23,989
fast for the first six to eight frames, it's confusing. Same thing at the end, during the last

524
00:33:24,029 --> 00:33:28,695
six or eight frames, add anything fast, it's confusing because we're expecting a resolution

525
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:30,056
to that beginning and there is none.

526
00:33:33,003 --> 00:33:41,666
Awesome. This is a crazy one. For any lead out there, it's not about whether you like something, it's about whether it actually makes sense, if it fits, if it's quality.

527
00:33:42,346 --> 00:33:49,929
We always say we don't need to like anything. I don't like the color purple. This is a perfect room for Lulu, our character in our game, because she likes purple.

528
00:33:50,009 --> 00:33:55,471
So I as an art director don't need to like it. If it actually fits the game, then it is correct.

529
00:33:59,921 --> 00:34:02,303
So contrast. So when you do, it's a simple thing. Just to

530
00:34:02,343 --> 00:34:05,806
make it more organic and less CG. If I grab this mic, let's

531
00:34:05,826 --> 00:34:08,569
pretend that's 15 frames from my hand from here to here. Don't

532
00:34:08,589 --> 00:34:12,913
do 15, 15. Do 15, 12, 15, 10. Just always make it different.

533
00:34:13,253 --> 00:34:16,656
Also don't go from pose A to pose B back to pose A. You go A

534
00:34:16,976 --> 00:34:19,579
to B to C. So it's always different. Always different

535
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,021
timing, different positions. Makes it more real, more organic

536
00:34:22,061 --> 00:34:22,381
and that's it.

537
00:34:33,962 --> 00:34:36,707
Thank you all so much for sticking with us. If you guys

538
00:34:36,748 --> 00:34:39,052
have great tricks, let us hear about it. Give us feedback

539
00:34:39,092 --> 00:34:41,578
whether this format works and whether you gain something out

540
00:34:41,618 --> 00:34:42,479
of it. Thank you.
