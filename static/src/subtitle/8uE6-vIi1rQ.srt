1
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:07,210
Thank you everyone for coming.

2
00:00:07,831 --> 00:00:09,231
This is Cursed Problems in Game Design.

3
00:00:09,852 --> 00:00:10,512
I'm Alex Jaffe.

4
00:00:12,413 --> 00:00:14,714
So, how do I go forward with this thing?

5
00:00:16,215 --> 00:00:16,495
Cool.

6
00:00:19,197 --> 00:00:20,097
This is amazing, okay.

7
00:00:20,477 --> 00:00:24,119
So, welcome to GDC, where we make good games gooder.

8
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:28,061
With talks like, how I balance my shotgun in 90 days,

9
00:00:28,241 --> 00:00:28,882
and you can too.

10
00:00:29,782 --> 00:00:31,983
Quest markers that even filthy casuals can follow.

11
00:00:33,064 --> 00:00:34,885
And eight hot loot table distributions for 2019.

12
00:00:37,494 --> 00:00:41,057
So these are actually great talks that I love,

13
00:00:41,117 --> 00:00:43,279
that have done a ton to improve my ability as a game designer

14
00:00:43,299 --> 00:00:44,120
that I've learned a lot from.

15
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,742
And I think this is what a lot of our work as game designers

16
00:00:46,942 --> 00:00:49,624
is, it's making games great, making great player

17
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:50,145
experiences.

18
00:00:50,805 --> 00:00:53,367
But these problems that these are trying to solve, a lot of

19
00:00:53,407 --> 00:00:56,450
them feel more like, they feel kind of like pearl diving.

20
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:58,952
Like there are all these solutions out there, and you

21
00:00:58,972 --> 00:01:00,293
have this huge array of them to pick from.

22
00:01:00,313 --> 00:01:02,675
And what you're looking for is the best, shiniest pearl to

23
00:01:02,715 --> 00:01:04,176
make your game as perfect as it can be.

24
00:01:05,017 --> 00:01:06,178
And that's great, and it's really important.

25
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,405
But I've often found myself more drawn to a different kind of design problem.

26
00:01:11,227 --> 00:01:12,789
One that's more like wandering the desert.

27
00:01:14,091 --> 00:01:17,437
For days, months, maybe even years, looking for a solution,

28
00:01:17,917 --> 00:01:21,162
wondering where one might be, and thinking maybe one doesn't even exist.

29
00:01:22,489 --> 00:01:27,430
So, the thing that's gotten me so maybe interested in these incredibly hard design problems is

30
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:28,470
my own background.

31
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:29,251
I'm Alex.

32
00:01:29,591 --> 00:01:30,571
Hi.

33
00:01:31,031 --> 00:01:33,191
I used to be a mathematician for a few years.

34
00:01:34,312 --> 00:01:38,672
And when I was a mathematician, you know, I would spend so long on like one problem.

35
00:01:38,873 --> 00:01:40,793
One problem that maybe people have worked on for decades.

36
00:01:40,813 --> 00:01:42,193
And you'd usually make no progress.

37
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:45,614
You'd spend, again, months or years on it, just kind of banging your head against it.

38
00:01:46,034 --> 00:01:48,855
And eventually you build a sort of Stockholm syndrome with a problem.

39
00:01:49,215 --> 00:01:51,175
Like, you come to love the way this thing tortures you,

40
00:01:51,415 --> 00:01:53,476
and you think, maybe I can learn more from this problem

41
00:01:53,496 --> 00:01:54,616
than I even can from the solution.

42
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,977
And I think there's really some truth to that, right?

43
00:01:56,997 --> 00:01:59,457
Problems realign our thinking when they're really well-posed.

44
00:01:59,777 --> 00:02:01,878
Sometimes finding the solution isn't the most important part.

45
00:02:02,438 --> 00:02:03,718
And so that's what's inspired this talk,

46
00:02:03,738 --> 00:02:05,859
and for years I've kind of wanted to focus on this topic.

47
00:02:06,199 --> 00:02:08,299
And I've thought about it as I did my PhD

48
00:02:08,499 --> 00:02:10,360
in essentially computational game balancing

49
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,480
at the University of Washington.

50
00:02:12,469 --> 00:02:16,891
And I've been a designer at Superbot, Congregate, and Spryfox, as well as a data scientist.

51
00:02:17,592 --> 00:02:21,894
And now I'm a designer at Riot Games and R&D in the Bay Area office.

52
00:02:21,914 --> 00:02:22,835
It's pretty awesome.

53
00:02:22,855 --> 00:02:25,216
A lot of you may not even know it exists, but it's a great place.

54
00:02:26,577 --> 00:02:29,699
And so all this time I've been thinking about hard design problems.

55
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,702
And what I've wondered is, all these different problems that if you pay attention to game

56
00:02:34,722 --> 00:02:35,623
design you start to notice.

57
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:40,292
I'm wondering if there's anything kind of shared, any shared DNA between them that causes

58
00:02:40,312 --> 00:02:43,794
them to be so hard, that causes them to maybe even be impossible.

59
00:02:45,575 --> 00:02:50,478
And yeah, I think I know what that is, at least for many of them, and that, you may

60
00:02:50,518 --> 00:02:52,258
not be surprised, is that they are cursed.

61
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,741
I'll get to a definition in a minute, what this means, and I'll also get you some examples

62
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:01,163
because I know you want to know what at least one hard problem is, but first an outline.

63
00:03:02,384 --> 00:03:02,484
So.

64
00:03:03,243 --> 00:03:04,464
There are basically two parts to this talk.

65
00:03:04,944 --> 00:03:09,347
In the first part, I tell you what curse problems are and where to find them.

66
00:03:10,508 --> 00:03:13,750
And basically, this is important because, look, the problems I'm going to talk about

67
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:18,693
today, the category of problems, they really don't have a clear solution.

68
00:03:18,733 --> 00:03:19,993
You can't just go in and solve them.

69
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:22,815
You really have to know that they are right in your face

70
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:26,097
so that you don't waste your time and your team's energy on them.

71
00:03:26,678 --> 00:03:28,178
And so this is the most important part of the talk.

72
00:03:28,219 --> 00:03:30,160
The talk where we understand what curse problems are

73
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,320
and can actually identify them.

74
00:03:31,501 --> 00:03:32,641
And that's what I do. I define them.

75
00:03:33,242 --> 00:03:34,002
I show you an example.

76
00:03:34,683 --> 00:03:38,545
And then I sort of give you maybe some intuition for how to identify them

77
00:03:38,605 --> 00:03:39,866
through the use of a bunch of examples.

78
00:03:40,226 --> 00:03:41,667
Okay? So that's the first part.

79
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:45,283
But the second part is defense against curse problems.

80
00:03:45,803 --> 00:03:47,724
It's what to do when you come up against a curse problem,

81
00:03:47,944 --> 00:03:51,046
and you have no choice but to bear right ahead.

82
00:03:51,366 --> 00:03:52,907
Or hopefully, what I'm really going to tell you you have to

83
00:03:52,947 --> 00:03:55,468
do is you have to tilt a little to the side, because

84
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:56,508
you can't solve the problem.

85
00:03:56,809 --> 00:03:58,970
But maybe you can give up some part of what you're trying to

86
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,170
do, and you can solve that.

87
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:03,332
And so what I'll do is I'll tell you a model for how I

88
00:04:03,352 --> 00:04:04,693
think about games in this context.

89
00:04:05,433 --> 00:04:07,294
And then I'll talk about four techniques

90
00:04:07,934 --> 00:04:09,455
for addressing curse problems.

91
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,196
Remember, I said I'm not going to solve them

92
00:04:11,496 --> 00:04:12,637
because they are unsolvable,

93
00:04:12,917 --> 00:04:14,277
but there will be ways to handle them.

94
00:04:14,698 --> 00:04:16,078
And these are techniques that I've sort of...

95
00:04:16,538 --> 00:04:18,279
I've taken a look at all the techniques

96
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:20,000
game developers have used over decades

97
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,441
to address problems like these

98
00:04:21,501 --> 00:04:23,462
and kind of bucketed them into these four categories.

99
00:04:23,802 --> 00:04:24,823
And I think it's a helpful framing

100
00:04:24,843 --> 00:04:26,463
for what to do when you encounter one.

101
00:04:27,484 --> 00:04:29,585
And finally, I'll show some more applications of these techniques

102
00:04:29,925 --> 00:04:31,466
so you build intuition for how to apply them

103
00:04:31,506 --> 00:04:32,106
if you ever get there.

104
00:04:32,126 --> 00:04:33,667
All right, everyone on board?

105
00:04:34,668 --> 00:04:34,868
Here we go.

106
00:04:36,188 --> 00:04:36,828
Let's have a definition.

107
00:04:37,929 --> 00:04:39,851
This is actually a sub-definition I need, real quick.

108
00:04:40,912 --> 00:04:42,473
Player promises, you may have heard of them.

109
00:04:43,013 --> 00:04:45,435
I consider them a game's essential experiences.

110
00:04:45,976 --> 00:04:47,857
Why did the player actually come to play this, right?

111
00:04:47,877 --> 00:04:48,938
What is the core of this game?

112
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:52,201
Zach McClendon has a talk, Welcome to the Yard Sale,

113
00:04:52,221 --> 00:04:53,642
which talks a lot about player promises,

114
00:04:53,762 --> 00:04:55,443
if you want to learn more about them, it's a great talk.

115
00:04:56,532 --> 00:04:58,856
But for me, the key thing that's happening here is that

116
00:04:59,297 --> 00:05:00,800
promises live in the designer's heart.

117
00:05:01,481 --> 00:05:03,885
It's the thing that is driving us to make this game.

118
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:06,129
It's what we care about at the fundamental level, the stuff

119
00:05:06,149 --> 00:05:06,811
we don't want to give up.

120
00:05:08,105 --> 00:05:10,687
But often, weirdly, they also can lie in the player's heart.

121
00:05:11,627 --> 00:05:13,928
Sometimes you give a player something really simple,

122
00:05:13,968 --> 00:05:15,769
just a few mechanics, a few systems,

123
00:05:16,089 --> 00:05:17,650
and then they immediately come to believe

124
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:20,091
that the game owes them something specific.

125
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:22,732
And you kind of have to accept that.

126
00:05:22,752 --> 00:05:25,133
You have to deal with the fact that you've made this promise

127
00:05:25,153 --> 00:05:27,454
to a player whether you meant to or not,

128
00:05:28,015 --> 00:05:29,115
and you have to adapt.

129
00:05:30,276 --> 00:05:31,916
So, now that we've outlined what promises are,

130
00:05:32,417 --> 00:05:33,297
the curse problem definition.

131
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,444
It is an unsolvable design problem rooted in a conflict between core player promises.

132
00:05:38,464 --> 00:05:40,285
You're going to see this slide a lot.

133
00:05:41,046 --> 00:05:44,569
So it's basically any time I'm trying to solve a design problem and I have implicitly or

134
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:48,933
explicitly promised two things that cannot coexist, it is surprisingly common.

135
00:05:50,234 --> 00:05:53,337
So one of the properties here is there is no direct solution.

136
00:05:53,397 --> 00:05:55,539
One does not simply solve curse problems.

137
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,281
You have to instead, you have to work around it.

138
00:05:59,722 --> 00:06:01,362
You have to give something up.

139
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:02,983
Like the Gordian Knot, you kind of have to cut through

140
00:06:03,003 --> 00:06:06,965
the problem itself and find a kind of a strange non-solution.

141
00:06:08,946 --> 00:06:10,046
So, that's the definition.

142
00:06:10,066 --> 00:06:11,107
And now you finally get an example.

143
00:06:11,147 --> 00:06:11,847
Thank you for your patience.

144
00:06:12,307 --> 00:06:14,908
The example will be a little hypothetical at first,

145
00:06:15,188 --> 00:06:17,089
but it will become more concrete as I move through it.

146
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,950
So I'll talk about Free For All Politics,

147
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,491
which I consider a cursed classic.

148
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:25,413
So a cursed problem often begins with a dream.

149
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:29,392
Say it's the 90s, and you love beat-em-ups.

150
00:06:29,892 --> 00:06:31,373
You love the punchin' and the kickin'

151
00:06:31,793 --> 00:06:34,394
and like a crowd control, lots of enemies to defeat.

152
00:06:35,214 --> 00:06:37,555
And it's also the 90s, and so at some point,

153
00:06:37,575 --> 00:06:39,176
Street Fighter II comes out, and you're like,

154
00:06:39,236 --> 00:06:40,077
wow, this is amazing.

155
00:06:40,097 --> 00:06:42,198
I get all this really high-skill execution,

156
00:06:42,238 --> 00:06:44,379
all this tactical choice-making, knowledge tests.

157
00:06:44,419 --> 00:06:47,080
I get to read my opponent's mind and act accordingly.

158
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,301
And you think, maybe these are two great tastes

159
00:06:49,321 --> 00:06:50,181
that would go great together.

160
00:06:51,123 --> 00:06:54,245
How about we give a controller to every one of these characters and we make this huge

161
00:06:54,785 --> 00:06:59,487
martial arts brawler game, everybody fighting it out with the technical execution and the

162
00:06:59,527 --> 00:07:05,170
tactics of a fighting game, but the kind of crowd control and chaos of a beat-em-up.

163
00:07:06,251 --> 00:07:10,293
This seems like I think a perfectly reasonable hypothetical game, something that would sound

164
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:10,833
exciting to me.

165
00:07:10,873 --> 00:07:12,194
I think it's a nice fantasy.

166
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:17,556
But as you go to make this, you want this really, really high competitive integrity

167
00:07:17,596 --> 00:07:19,097
game that's all about managing your opponents.

168
00:07:20,104 --> 00:07:23,726
You notice something weird, which is the best player,

169
00:07:23,786 --> 00:07:25,948
say, Gene's dude with the jump,

170
00:07:27,249 --> 00:07:28,589
that player, the one who's great at tactics

171
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:31,211
and great at buttons and great at mind reading,

172
00:07:31,531 --> 00:07:32,332
isn't actually winning.

173
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:33,893
Other players are winning.

174
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:36,154
And the reason why is politics,

175
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,315
which I'll define as competition

176
00:07:38,335 --> 00:07:41,878
through social negotiation, alliances, and manipulation.

177
00:07:42,818 --> 00:07:46,960
And there's some great treatment of politics in Characteristics of Games by Elias Garfield

178
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:47,640
and Gushera.

179
00:07:48,141 --> 00:07:51,782
This is probably my favorite, or at least one of my favorite game design textbooks and

180
00:07:51,802 --> 00:07:54,144
it is sorely under read, so please check it out.

181
00:07:58,829 --> 00:08:03,071
What happens is players start to play this game, they sit down to play, and you realize

182
00:08:03,111 --> 00:08:07,054
that they immediately figure out who the best player is in terms of the core gameplay.

183
00:08:07,394 --> 00:08:10,676
And instead they start forming alliances against this player, they gang up on them.

184
00:08:11,376 --> 00:08:13,437
They maybe pretend to be their friend and betray this person.

185
00:08:14,978 --> 00:08:18,560
They play down and pretend not to be too strong and then at the last minute they strike and

186
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,681
kick ass.

187
00:08:19,921 --> 00:08:23,183
And what happens is you realize that the core skill of playing this game is not the skill

188
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:24,043
that you were emphasizing.

189
00:08:24,664 --> 00:08:25,704
It's not the game you thought you were making.

190
00:08:25,724 --> 00:08:27,666
This is a game of Thrones.

191
00:08:28,046 --> 00:08:31,829
This is a game entirely about politics and manipulation.

192
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:34,712
And maybe punching well is helpful,

193
00:08:34,752 --> 00:08:37,274
but it's not really what you cared about as a designer,

194
00:08:37,314 --> 00:08:38,675
and probably not what the player expected.

195
00:08:39,996 --> 00:08:43,018
So, remember, a curse problem is an unsolvable design problem

196
00:08:43,359 --> 00:08:45,681
rooted in a conflict between core player promises.

197
00:08:46,521 --> 00:08:47,082
So in this case...

198
00:08:48,178 --> 00:08:52,102
A player looks at this game, they look at all the, you know, the difficult execution,

199
00:08:52,462 --> 00:08:54,764
they look at, you know, all the moves you can do, and they think this is a game about

200
00:08:54,864 --> 00:08:55,705
combat mastery.

201
00:08:56,446 --> 00:09:00,129
I want to focus on combat mastery and be great at this, and I want the game to, you know,

202
00:09:00,169 --> 00:09:01,010
emphasize that correctly.

203
00:09:01,551 --> 00:09:04,394
But it's also, it's a, you know, we've made this really competitive game, it emphasizes

204
00:09:04,414 --> 00:09:05,675
the winner, I want to play to win.

205
00:09:06,856 --> 00:09:09,759
These are both reasonable promises to take away from the game I've described.

206
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:12,201
But these promises are incompatible.

207
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:16,513
Because playing to win in a free-for-all game requires politics.

208
00:09:16,573 --> 00:09:18,594
It is the optimal strategy from a game theoretic standpoint,

209
00:09:18,634 --> 00:09:19,875
from a psychological standpoint.

210
00:09:20,496 --> 00:09:23,598
But the focus on combat mastery is not compatible with political play.

211
00:09:23,638 --> 00:09:25,379
They're different player emphases.

212
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,441
And so you end up with this big nope.

213
00:09:27,501 --> 00:09:28,942
You can't make this game.

214
00:09:28,982 --> 00:09:29,942
The game is cursed.

215
00:09:30,443 --> 00:09:30,643
All right?

216
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:32,564
This game you have in your head is cursed.

217
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:34,346
So.

218
00:09:35,357 --> 00:09:37,098
You're probably wondering, well, can't I do something?

219
00:09:37,138 --> 00:09:38,558
And yes, you can do something.

220
00:09:38,598 --> 00:09:39,759
You can get out of the situation.

221
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:43,140
But it requires giving something up.

222
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,941
It requires changing something about your core premise.

223
00:09:46,801 --> 00:09:48,201
So it's a fantasy.

224
00:09:48,641 --> 00:09:49,042
What do you do?

225
00:09:49,742 --> 00:09:51,542
You let go of the dream, at least a little bit.

226
00:09:53,243 --> 00:09:55,263
So one thing you could do, just an example, is you could

227
00:09:55,304 --> 00:09:56,484
weaken the promises.

228
00:09:57,304 --> 00:09:59,965
So we said the promises were to focus on combat mastery and

229
00:10:00,005 --> 00:10:00,725
also to play to win.

230
00:10:01,463 --> 00:10:03,563
But maybe we change our game a little bit to weaken these.

231
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,764
We pour in a little bit of chaos, and we end up with a

232
00:10:06,784 --> 00:10:08,965
game where you kind of want a chance to do some cool moves

233
00:10:09,005 --> 00:10:10,485
if you can, but you don't really expect it.

234
00:10:11,406 --> 00:10:14,627
And you want to win if possible, but it doesn't feel

235
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:16,787
like something you can really, really guarantee just by being

236
00:10:17,227 --> 00:10:18,288
the best at the core skills.

237
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:22,494
And when you do this, you make these changes, you change,

238
00:10:23,054 --> 00:10:26,258
weaken the promises here, you end up with something that might even be better,

239
00:10:26,318 --> 00:10:27,739
even though it's not what you initially expected.

240
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,581
You end up with Smash Brothers.

241
00:10:30,002 --> 00:10:31,403
This is a very good beloved game.

242
00:10:32,624 --> 00:10:34,446
It basically takes this premise I described and says,

243
00:10:34,526 --> 00:10:36,268
screw it, just like let it be crazy.

244
00:10:36,308 --> 00:10:39,672
I'm not talking about the 1v1 game without the items on, you know, Final Destination.

245
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,193
I'm talking about, like, the party game.

246
00:10:41,754 --> 00:10:47,519
The four-player game with random items and stage hazards and smash balls.

247
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:49,820
Like, this is the game that initially made this game big.

248
00:10:49,861 --> 00:10:52,723
And it's a great game because they knew what they were making.

249
00:10:53,263 --> 00:10:55,986
They had a box of constraints.

250
00:10:56,006 --> 00:10:58,928
They had a box of promises that they could actually fulfill.

251
00:10:59,834 --> 00:11:03,657
And I'm not saying that Nintendo saw they were in a cursed problem situation

252
00:11:03,677 --> 00:11:06,559
and they cleverly found their way out of it, though that may be what happened.

253
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,941
I think it just aligns with their values, right?

254
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:11,223
The game they wanted to make happened to be a game you can make.

255
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:15,267
But you can totally imagine another designer in this situation

256
00:11:15,727 --> 00:11:18,689
like, really, really focusing on that initial problem I described

257
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:21,772
and just wandering the desert, cursed to wander for years,

258
00:11:22,132 --> 00:11:25,395
just looking for that one solution to make their game perfect.

259
00:11:26,968 --> 00:11:29,289
And the worst part is that they might be dragging a whole

260
00:11:29,349 --> 00:11:30,489
buttload of teammates with them.

261
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:35,051
This is not a good situation.

262
00:11:36,171 --> 00:11:37,991
You want to recognize curse problems before

263
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:38,892
they really cost you.

264
00:11:39,392 --> 00:11:40,292
You don't want to get stuck in them.

265
00:11:40,772 --> 00:11:41,992
But you also want to understand your

266
00:11:42,052 --> 00:11:42,913
options to move forward.

267
00:11:43,493 --> 00:11:45,553
So that is what I will continue to talk about.

268
00:11:47,194 --> 00:11:49,134
So let's talk about how to identify curse problems now.

269
00:11:49,214 --> 00:11:51,055
By the way, I'm sorry for the Harry Potter references.

270
00:11:51,075 --> 00:11:52,675
I've never seen a Harry Potter movie, so I feel like

271
00:11:52,695 --> 00:11:53,815
somehow that makes it more justifiable.

272
00:11:56,858 --> 00:11:59,740
So I'll give you two more curse problems and throughout the talk I'll show you a bunch

273
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,102
more curse problems as it becomes relevant.

274
00:12:02,642 --> 00:12:07,446
And some of them you may look at and kind of like look a stance at because I'm going

275
00:12:07,466 --> 00:12:10,229
to talk about really great games that are really successful and you think they can't

276
00:12:10,249 --> 00:12:11,650
possibly be cursed, right?

277
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,912
But even no game is perfect, right?

278
00:12:14,492 --> 00:12:18,996
And even great games can be suffering in a large way from some failed promise.

279
00:12:20,653 --> 00:12:23,375
And, you know, maybe you want to make a different game, maybe that game.

280
00:12:24,055 --> 00:12:26,976
And then the other thing is also we'll see some games that are what they are because

281
00:12:27,016 --> 00:12:30,138
they made the sacrifices necessary to get out of a curse problem situation.

282
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:34,080
So one example is the quarterbacking problem.

283
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,280
This one's pretty well known.

284
00:12:35,901 --> 00:12:38,102
Say you're playing a turn-based cooperative game.

285
00:12:38,802 --> 00:12:43,485
If you've played a game like Pandemic, you try to put out viruses spreading around the

286
00:12:43,505 --> 00:12:43,765
world.

287
00:12:43,785 --> 00:12:45,365
Everyone's having a good time.

288
00:12:45,746 --> 00:12:46,806
I'm going to Australia.

289
00:12:46,846 --> 00:12:47,607
You're going to...

290
00:12:49,187 --> 00:12:52,829
I don't know, Canada, and everybody's kind of doing their own thing

291
00:12:53,429 --> 00:12:57,071
in this cooperative experience, until one player, who's real clever, has this idea

292
00:12:57,671 --> 00:13:00,212
that everybody should go to different countries than where they planned.

293
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:04,935
And, you know, we're all good people, good friends, so we go along with it, and we actually perform

294
00:13:04,975 --> 00:13:08,596
well as a consequence. And slowly this person takes more and more responsibility

295
00:13:08,676 --> 00:13:12,678
until they're essentially running the entire show. And we're playing a single player game,

296
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:15,660
effectively. We're just the hands of this one person with all the clever ideas.

297
00:13:17,132 --> 00:13:20,454
This is sort of a fundamental property of turn-based cooperative games, that this can

298
00:13:20,494 --> 00:13:20,795
happen.

299
00:13:21,215 --> 00:13:24,197
Because on the one hand, you want to have this cooperative experience.

300
00:13:24,918 --> 00:13:28,521
I want this harmonious Ocean's Eleven feel where everybody's doing their own part, like

301
00:13:28,561 --> 00:13:30,523
I'm the doctor and that means I'm thinking doctor thoughts.

302
00:13:31,023 --> 00:13:32,444
You can't think my doctor thoughts for me.

303
00:13:32,744 --> 00:13:37,028
But it's a strategy game, so one person sort of can do the whole thing, right?

304
00:13:37,188 --> 00:13:40,911
We want to play to win, and the best way to play to win is actually centralized decision

305
00:13:40,951 --> 00:13:42,572
making, at least in a game like this.

306
00:13:43,193 --> 00:13:46,997
And that centralized decision making is fundamentally incompatible with the interdependence between

307
00:13:47,037 --> 00:13:49,479
players that's part of the fantasy of a co-op game.

308
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,924
So even though this is a great game, it fundamentally kind of breaks its own promises.

309
00:13:55,865 --> 00:13:56,586
It is a cursed problem.

310
00:13:57,387 --> 00:13:59,409
And a lot of games like it are.

311
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:00,330
Okay.

312
00:14:01,431 --> 00:14:02,852
And let's look at one more for now.

313
00:14:03,032 --> 00:14:04,354
I call it the skill inflation problem.

314
00:14:05,408 --> 00:14:07,269
So this occurs for evergreen competitive games,

315
00:14:07,289 --> 00:14:10,111
sort of PVP games you want to exist for many years.

316
00:14:10,871 --> 00:14:13,893
Games like this launch and they are often awesome,

317
00:14:13,993 --> 00:14:15,754
you have an amazing time, you have all kinds of different players

318
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:17,115
playing at different skill levels,

319
00:14:17,655 --> 00:14:21,418
but slowly as the game matures, the audience matures with it, right?

320
00:14:21,438 --> 00:14:23,839
And all the players get better and better, kind of in lockstep.

321
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,561
And what's worse, the players who aren't getting better,

322
00:14:27,961 --> 00:14:28,681
they tend to leave.

323
00:14:29,182 --> 00:14:31,142
Maybe because they're not as invested or because it's frustrating.

324
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:33,483
And by the time you're years into one of these games,

325
00:14:33,503 --> 00:14:34,824
like, you may still have a great game,

326
00:14:35,164 --> 00:14:37,145
but it's very, very hard for new players to break in.

327
00:14:37,645 --> 00:14:39,806
Because all the players they see around them are incredibly good,

328
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:42,707
they maybe have a hard time matchmaking with players at their level,

329
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,788
and even they go online and they watch Twitch and everybody's good

330
00:14:44,808 --> 00:14:45,928
and they just feel like a total fraud.

331
00:14:47,045 --> 00:14:48,787
This sucks.

332
00:14:48,967 --> 00:14:51,089
Even an individual player, even a really serious player,

333
00:14:51,109 --> 00:14:51,790
suffers from this.

334
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:55,253
Because this player wants a long journey of mastery.

335
00:14:55,293 --> 00:14:57,295
They want to be able to get better for decades.

336
00:14:57,956 --> 00:15:00,359
But they also want a stable, vibrant community.

337
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,083
They want players coming together and playing together

338
00:15:05,123 --> 00:15:05,864
and new people coming in.

339
00:15:05,884 --> 00:15:07,346
And they want to be able to play this for their whole life.

340
00:15:08,646 --> 00:15:10,927
These things are incompatible because a long journey

341
00:15:10,947 --> 00:15:13,108
of mastering naturally results in a rising skill pool.

342
00:15:13,648 --> 00:15:16,049
But a stable, vibrant community requires

343
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:18,430
a broad variety of skill levels, right?

344
00:15:18,671 --> 00:15:20,832
These don't go together, and again, it's a curse problem.

345
00:15:21,312 --> 00:15:23,073
Now, as I said, right, all of these curse problems,

346
00:15:23,093 --> 00:15:25,474
they have answers, but the thing I'm gonna show you

347
00:15:25,534 --> 00:15:27,695
is how these answers end up requiring giving up

348
00:15:27,855 --> 00:15:30,176
some small, sometimes large, piece of the fantasy.

349
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:35,298
Okay, so what isn't a curse problem, you may ask?

350
00:15:36,007 --> 00:15:37,587
It's not all design problems.

351
00:15:37,627 --> 00:15:39,268
It's not like any time you're weighing any two things

352
00:15:39,308 --> 00:15:40,549
against each other, we have a curse problem.

353
00:15:40,569 --> 00:15:41,569
I really want to make this clear.

354
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:45,912
Let's just consider any common degenerate core

355
00:15:45,932 --> 00:15:46,632
gameplay pattern.

356
00:15:47,748 --> 00:15:50,830
Like for example, this is Hungrybox playing Jigglypuff in Smash Melee.

357
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:52,311
Now we're at the 1v1 version of Melee.

358
00:15:54,052 --> 00:15:58,075
And this pattern is extremely frustrating to a lot of players, including pros, right?

359
00:15:58,175 --> 00:16:01,497
He plays Jigglypuff in this way that's extremely defensive, very reactive.

360
00:16:01,817 --> 00:16:03,978
You make one mistake and he just jumps on you.

361
00:16:04,719 --> 00:16:07,480
Other players are forced to play his game, basically.

362
00:16:07,961 --> 00:16:09,001
And a lot of them don't like it.

363
00:16:09,915 --> 00:16:15,978
And so you as the Smash designer may be totally fine with this, like, cool, this is the game

364
00:16:15,998 --> 00:16:16,358
we're playing.

365
00:16:16,578 --> 00:16:17,639
But you might want to remove it.

366
00:16:18,259 --> 00:16:18,780
What can you do?

367
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,001
You can tweak any number of things.

368
00:16:21,321 --> 00:16:25,683
You can tweak attacks, defense, movement, the pace of the game, map, all kinds of changes

369
00:16:25,723 --> 00:16:28,845
you can make to basically make this play pattern just go away.

370
00:16:29,926 --> 00:16:32,047
Either by making it impossible or disincentivizing it.

371
00:16:33,537 --> 00:16:35,759
And there's nothing to stop you from doing this, because

372
00:16:36,359 --> 00:16:40,643
there's no fundamental rule of Smash, there's nothing, like, deep within your heart about this game

373
00:16:40,683 --> 00:16:43,625
that tells you you have to be able to play this incredibly annoying keep-away game.

374
00:16:44,326 --> 00:16:46,728
Like, it is just an emergent property of the choices they made.

375
00:16:46,828 --> 00:16:50,011
So they can go in and fix it, and it's still going to be the same game.

376
00:16:51,773 --> 00:16:53,794
Can we do a similar thing with free-for-all politics?

377
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:55,299
We cannot.

378
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,801
Because no matter what I do to kind of tweak

379
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,162
the main tuning parameters of the game

380
00:17:01,222 --> 00:17:03,183
or change the content, we're still

381
00:17:03,203 --> 00:17:05,124
going to have this fundamental incompatibility.

382
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:09,446
The politics, it does not go with no politics.

383
00:17:09,466 --> 00:17:11,827
And there's no little change you can make to a move or something

384
00:17:11,847 --> 00:17:13,888
that makes these not go together.

385
00:17:14,509 --> 00:17:15,349
Makes these go together, excuse me.

386
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:19,390
We're gonna play a game, alright?

387
00:17:20,051 --> 00:17:21,252
You, the people, are gonna tell me

388
00:17:21,672 --> 00:17:22,653
what is hard and what is cursed.

389
00:17:23,434 --> 00:17:24,675
And this is important because I want you

390
00:17:24,715 --> 00:17:26,257
to build intuition for these.

391
00:17:26,417 --> 00:17:28,238
And it's not like some objective thing,

392
00:17:28,258 --> 00:17:29,459
it is a little subjective.

393
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,602
So, you know, reasonable people can disagree

394
00:17:32,642 --> 00:17:34,324
about what's cursed, but I also think

395
00:17:34,384 --> 00:17:36,746
that reasonable people, having had enough time

396
00:17:37,247 --> 00:17:38,768
to become familiar with this concept,

397
00:17:39,128 --> 00:17:41,511
will mostly agree about what's cursed and what's not.

398
00:17:41,971 --> 00:17:45,574
You have to identify two promises that are incompatible with one another,

399
00:17:45,614 --> 00:17:47,596
and you have to convince yourself that they're actually incompatible.

400
00:17:47,936 --> 00:17:50,138
And the second part is actually where you might have more disagreement.

401
00:17:50,738 --> 00:17:54,421
But, you know, all you need to really know is that they're incompatible enough

402
00:17:54,761 --> 00:17:57,624
that I have to take a kind of different approach to dealing with the problem.

403
00:17:58,905 --> 00:18:00,066
So, first example.

404
00:18:01,202 --> 00:18:02,904
Exploration games with millions of worlds.

405
00:18:03,464 --> 00:18:05,846
So No Man's Sky had this huge promise, right?

406
00:18:05,906 --> 00:18:08,227
Everyone was so excited about this incredible exploration

407
00:18:08,268 --> 00:18:10,209
game, traveling through space, seeing millions of planets,

408
00:18:10,229 --> 00:18:11,810
seeing all kinds of diverse flora and fauna,

409
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:12,751
lots of stuff to do.

410
00:18:12,771 --> 00:18:14,212
It was really exciting.

411
00:18:14,272 --> 00:18:16,173
But when it launched, people were disappointed.

412
00:18:18,195 --> 00:18:19,696
Felt like the promises were not kept.

413
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:22,783
You know, there was millions of worlds to explore promise,

414
00:18:22,863 --> 00:18:25,566
this vibrant, diverse, interactive ecosystems promise.

415
00:18:26,046 --> 00:18:28,989
My question is, are these fundamentally incompatible promises?

416
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:30,150
Is this a curse problem?

417
00:18:30,451 --> 00:18:32,773
Or are these just hard to simultaneously satisfy?

418
00:18:32,953 --> 00:18:33,874
So, who thinks it's cursed?

419
00:18:35,355 --> 00:18:35,555
All right.

420
00:18:36,236 --> 00:18:36,877
Who thinks it's hard?

421
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:38,358
All right.

422
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:39,679
Frank's wrong.

423
00:18:43,031 --> 00:18:45,633
Yeah, so it is, they do, I think they go together.

424
00:18:45,653 --> 00:18:47,354
And the proof that they go together is that a year later,

425
00:18:47,374 --> 00:18:49,655
this is kind of a spoiler-able question,

426
00:18:49,675 --> 00:18:52,096
because a year later, No Man's Sky came out with an update

427
00:18:52,496 --> 00:18:53,497
that was really successful.

428
00:18:53,537 --> 00:18:55,418
People felt like that promise had been delivered upon.

429
00:18:55,678 --> 00:18:58,099
You just take so much work to make the game they had promised.

430
00:18:58,119 --> 00:19:00,000
There's nothing, there's no contradiction in it.

431
00:19:00,901 --> 00:19:01,601
It's just really hard.

432
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:03,862
All right, question two of three.

433
00:19:05,023 --> 00:19:06,243
Loot games with efficient trading.

434
00:19:06,824 --> 00:19:08,204
This is the Diablo III auction house.

435
00:19:09,075 --> 00:19:11,236
So, besides from the audience.

436
00:19:12,917 --> 00:19:15,138
So despite what you may think, I think this is a cool idea.

437
00:19:16,358 --> 00:19:18,959
Because Diablo is a game about, you know,

438
00:19:18,979 --> 00:19:20,520
gathering lots of loot, killing monsters,

439
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,901
finding all kinds of cool stuff, and then often,

440
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:24,621
I think, when you're collecting so much,

441
00:19:24,661 --> 00:19:26,922
this commerce fantasy naturally comes online.

442
00:19:27,442 --> 00:19:29,063
You want to trade with your friends,

443
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:29,963
you want to buy, you want to sell,

444
00:19:29,983 --> 00:19:32,144
you want to feel like you're part of this big global marketplace.

445
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:34,585
But when it actually launched, people felt like

446
00:19:35,005 --> 00:19:36,946
it didn't really land, and it kind of like,

447
00:19:37,226 --> 00:19:37,886
the game didn't work out.

448
00:19:38,547 --> 00:19:41,309
So the rich loot experience and the ubiquitous marketplace fantasy.

449
00:19:41,349 --> 00:19:45,892
These are these two promises that you get when you put an efficient trading market into a loot-based game.

450
00:19:47,013 --> 00:19:49,295
Are these fundamentally incompatible? Is it cursed?

451
00:19:49,735 --> 00:19:50,496
Raise your hand if it's cursed.

452
00:19:52,277 --> 00:19:53,778
Alright. Now raise your hand if it's hard.

453
00:19:54,926 --> 00:19:56,127
Okay, so a little more disagreement.

454
00:19:56,447 --> 00:19:59,229
So I'm gonna make a pretty strong claim that this is cursed,

455
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:02,632
because varied loot drop experiences

456
00:20:03,052 --> 00:20:05,714
is kind of the core theme, core piece

457
00:20:05,754 --> 00:20:06,855
of a rich loot experience, right?

458
00:20:07,075 --> 00:20:08,937
I need to constantly be able to kill a monster

459
00:20:09,157 --> 00:20:10,378
and then wonder what's gonna come out of it,

460
00:20:10,398 --> 00:20:12,239
and then see this amazing thing pop out and be like,

461
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:13,580
this is great, this is the best day of my life.

462
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:16,843
But on the other hand, this marketplace fantasy

463
00:20:16,863 --> 00:20:18,364
means items are fungible for one another.

464
00:20:18,904 --> 00:20:22,846
Every item is essentially just worth to me what I can buy it for in the auction house.

465
00:20:23,266 --> 00:20:26,288
So what's happened all of a sudden is now every monster in the game is basically just spawning gold.

466
00:20:26,468 --> 00:20:27,949
Over and over and over again, effectively.

467
00:20:28,669 --> 00:20:32,911
So I claim it's cursed and I think in the end there was nothing they could have done to tune this

468
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:35,073
to make the core fantasy work out.

469
00:20:35,673 --> 00:20:40,676
One of the producers of the game, oh I should say this is a special case of what I call the commodified reward problem.

470
00:20:40,696 --> 00:20:45,258
One of the producers said that the auction house undermines Diablo's core gameplay,

471
00:20:45,498 --> 00:20:46,899
which is to kill monsters to get loot.

472
00:20:47,785 --> 00:20:49,209
And I endorse that statement.

473
00:20:50,111 --> 00:20:50,292
OK.

474
00:20:50,974 --> 00:20:53,841
So the third and final quiz question, always on location

475
00:20:53,862 --> 00:20:54,383
based games.

476
00:20:56,747 --> 00:20:58,948
This is the preferred method of playing Pokemon Go.

477
00:21:00,909 --> 00:21:02,790
So I mean, this is a spicy image, obviously.

478
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:05,872
But in general, I think location-based games have

479
00:21:05,892 --> 00:21:08,834
this interesting situation where the promise is, hey, you

480
00:21:08,874 --> 00:21:11,095
go into the world and it's an overlay on top of your life.

481
00:21:11,175 --> 00:21:13,456
It's like this extra magical layer in your life where

482
00:21:13,476 --> 00:21:14,577
everything is a little bit different.

483
00:21:14,997 --> 00:21:17,219
And at any moment, I might want to pull out my phone and

484
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:19,840
catch a Pokemon.

485
00:21:20,561 --> 00:21:24,463
And that sounds cool, but also has this tension, which is

486
00:21:24,523 --> 00:21:24,723
that

487
00:21:26,066 --> 00:21:28,448
I might be driving and die or kill someone.

488
00:21:29,049 --> 00:21:30,990
I might just be walking down the street and trip.

489
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,693
I might go out of my way, maybe in a way that kind of inconveniences me.

490
00:21:34,953 --> 00:21:38,496
Or just in a more banal level, I might not really be present in my daily life.

491
00:21:39,056 --> 00:21:40,297
I might not pay attention to my friends.

492
00:21:40,897 --> 00:21:42,458
So what I'm wondering, these two things,

493
00:21:43,558 --> 00:21:46,199
the game kind of demands rewards at specific times and places

494
00:21:46,219 --> 00:21:48,179
to make it feel like it has that magical overlay,

495
00:21:48,719 --> 00:21:51,920
but also there's this need for personal safety and convenience

496
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,920
and also mindfulness at some level

497
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,701
that I think is a basic need that the game doesn't promise,

498
00:21:56,721 --> 00:21:58,221
but we assume games will not violate.

499
00:21:58,781 --> 00:22:00,202
So, who thinks it's cursed?

500
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:03,823
All right. Who thinks it's just really hard?

501
00:22:04,877 --> 00:22:07,918
Alright, I want to know how you guys want to solve this, because

502
00:22:09,779 --> 00:22:13,260
because for the life of me, these two things seem fundamentally incompatible.

503
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:19,302
So, I think the... Now, I know why this might happen, why it might seem hard.

504
00:22:19,322 --> 00:22:24,303
So I'm saying that this is cursed, because you sort of need to be able to play anywhere at any time

505
00:22:25,163 --> 00:22:29,125
in order to satisfy the first promise, but to satisfy the second, you need to play when appropriate.

506
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,702
And I know why it might seem like this is just a hard problem,

507
00:22:32,722 --> 00:22:35,364
because you're like, well surely we can put limits in the game, right?

508
00:22:35,404 --> 00:22:38,026
We can make it so you only see, you know,

509
00:22:39,006 --> 00:22:40,728
monsters at times that are appropriate,

510
00:22:40,748 --> 00:22:42,409
or when other people are playing around you, or something like that.

511
00:22:42,869 --> 00:22:43,970
And I think that all of those,

512
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,771
once we get a little further into Chris' problems,

513
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:49,434
we see that all of those kind of are violating that first promise to some extent.

514
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:54,293
And so that's why I say this is cursed, because the moves that you have to make to actually

515
00:22:54,954 --> 00:23:00,358
make the situation go away kind of turn it into a different game, at least a little bit.

516
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:04,761
And I think that's why you still have these problems in these games years later, right?

517
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:06,983
Because you don't want to break that first core promise.

518
00:23:08,064 --> 00:23:08,204
Okay.

519
00:23:09,405 --> 00:23:13,248
So, generally, I'd call this like the life disruption problem, and there are other very

520
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:15,290
different games that encounter these problems.

521
00:23:16,556 --> 00:23:17,236
So this is where we are.

522
00:23:18,417 --> 00:23:20,098
The big ocean there is your game.

523
00:23:20,138 --> 00:23:21,879
It's a wide sea of possibilities,

524
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,201
all kinds of things for players to do, have fun.

525
00:23:24,681 --> 00:23:27,623
And that eldritch horror living in the heart of your game

526
00:23:27,683 --> 00:23:28,924
is your curse problem.

527
00:23:28,944 --> 00:23:30,545
They're just there underneath the sea,

528
00:23:30,965 --> 00:23:32,386
kind of corrupting everything around them.

529
00:23:32,806 --> 00:23:33,547
And it's not like a fish,

530
00:23:33,567 --> 00:23:34,888
you can't just like spear it and pull it out.

531
00:23:35,268 --> 00:23:37,590
The thing about Cthulhu is he's not leaving the ocean,

532
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:38,450
like he's just there.

533
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:41,772
It's core baked into the premise of your game.

534
00:23:42,513 --> 00:23:43,934
So what do you do when you encounter

535
00:23:43,974 --> 00:23:45,855
an eldritch horror that won't leave?

536
00:23:46,765 --> 00:23:48,627
You make sacrifices. You kill your babies.

537
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,391
And that's what we're going to do.

538
00:23:54,831 --> 00:23:57,493
There's four little kinds of sacrifices down here we can make.

539
00:23:58,214 --> 00:24:00,335
And each of them is a little different, right?

540
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:02,777
They're different ways of giving up some subtle,

541
00:24:02,837 --> 00:24:06,420
sometimes implicit piece of one of your promises.

542
00:24:07,921 --> 00:24:08,741
And that's the rest of the talk.

543
00:24:09,255 --> 00:24:09,456
OK?

544
00:24:09,936 --> 00:24:11,737
So we've talked about curse problems.

545
00:24:11,757 --> 00:24:13,358
We've talked about why they are hard,

546
00:24:13,658 --> 00:24:15,880
why they will likely screw you over if you don't notice them.

547
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,221
Now we're going to say, all right, well,

548
00:24:17,261 --> 00:24:18,362
if you still are dealing with one,

549
00:24:18,422 --> 00:24:19,503
if you still want to make this game,

550
00:24:19,843 --> 00:24:22,004
how can you make a sacrifice, give up

551
00:24:22,024 --> 00:24:24,166
some piece of your fantasy, and make a slightly different game

552
00:24:24,186 --> 00:24:26,888
that hopefully still makes you happy, still is good enough?

553
00:24:27,988 --> 00:24:29,429
So first I'll present a game model.

554
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:31,911
How I think about a game that will build

555
00:24:31,951 --> 00:24:32,912
these techniques on top of.

556
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:35,854
And it will look scary at first, but it won't be scary.

557
00:24:37,117 --> 00:24:39,599
So remember, a curse problem is an unsolvable design problem

558
00:24:39,939 --> 00:24:42,540
rooted in a conflict between core player promises.

559
00:24:44,782 --> 00:24:46,563
And I'm gonna talk about a common special case of this

560
00:24:47,443 --> 00:24:49,665
in which these two promises aren't just anything.

561
00:24:49,785 --> 00:24:52,086
One is an experience and one is an objective.

562
00:24:53,207 --> 00:24:55,388
So by experiences, I mean moment-to-moment gameplay.

563
00:24:55,448 --> 00:24:57,009
What is this game like to play?

564
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:00,631
But by objectives, I mean like the goals of the game,

565
00:25:00,651 --> 00:25:02,652
the driving forces, the things that I'm trying

566
00:25:02,672 --> 00:25:03,773
to get out of the game in the end.

567
00:25:04,777 --> 00:25:06,939
And so these objectives are kind of pulling us through,

568
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,501
motivating us through different experiences,

569
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:11,623
whether we think they're great or not.

570
00:25:12,804 --> 00:25:15,786
And I think it's okay to limit us to just...

571
00:25:16,877 --> 00:25:20,620
This definition of curse problems for now, because first of all it covers a lot of the

572
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,924
cases, probably more than half, but second it's just a much simpler case to talk about.

573
00:25:24,944 --> 00:25:28,968
The techniques I'm going to talk about are easier to explain in this context.

574
00:25:29,549 --> 00:25:33,573
They do generalize to the general case that looks like this, any two player promises.

575
00:25:33,933 --> 00:25:34,834
But we're focusing on this.

576
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:40,716
Remember the free-for-all politics problem?

577
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:45,224
So in this case, we have the desire to focus on combat mastery.

578
00:25:45,645 --> 00:25:46,867
That is an experience.

579
00:25:47,489 --> 00:25:49,753
And the desire to play to win is an objective.

580
00:25:50,274 --> 00:25:51,997
That's the kind of contrast I'm talking about.

581
00:25:53,497 --> 00:25:54,157
So here's my model.

582
00:25:54,517 --> 00:25:54,998
It's a game.

583
00:25:55,418 --> 00:25:57,219
Start state is S, and the objective

584
00:25:57,239 --> 00:25:58,580
is wherever you're going, O.

585
00:25:59,341 --> 00:26:00,902
And the objective can be given by the game,

586
00:26:00,922 --> 00:26:03,504
but often it's at least partially supplied by the player.

587
00:26:03,944 --> 00:26:05,425
And all the nodes in between are the play space.

588
00:26:05,445 --> 00:26:06,746
It's all the things you can do in the game.

589
00:26:07,167 --> 00:26:08,648
Kind of like a state machine, but you

590
00:26:08,668 --> 00:26:10,949
should think of these nodes as including

591
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:12,671
kind of the player's mental state, as well as

592
00:26:12,931 --> 00:26:13,891
the digital state of the game.

593
00:26:15,144 --> 00:26:17,145
And these objectives, they pull players through the game.

594
00:26:17,165 --> 00:26:19,727
As I said, they kind of guide you into certain places one

595
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:20,227
after another.

596
00:26:20,707 --> 00:26:22,468
And they guide you through this sort of golden path, like

597
00:26:22,528 --> 00:26:23,769
this is the right way to play.

598
00:26:23,989 --> 00:26:26,170
And you might not want to play this way, but it's what

599
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:26,691
you're going to do.

600
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:29,252
And there might be multiple golden paths, but I'm going to

601
00:26:29,272 --> 00:26:30,253
use one as an example.

602
00:26:31,293 --> 00:26:32,914
So I've abstracted a little.

603
00:26:33,855 --> 00:26:34,995
This here is your game.

604
00:26:35,916 --> 00:26:37,837
And this is your game on Curse Problems.

605
00:26:38,832 --> 00:26:44,417
This is the situation we get into, where the fire represents promises not being met.

606
00:26:44,457 --> 00:26:49,040
The experiential promise that was given by the designer or just the player imagined themselves

607
00:26:49,401 --> 00:26:52,303
is just not being met, but the player is taking themselves through it because they want to

608
00:26:52,323 --> 00:26:53,103
get to that objective.

609
00:26:53,844 --> 00:27:00,669
So to make this concrete, in this case, the fiery hellscape is political play, the grassy

610
00:27:00,769 --> 00:27:05,233
lovely area is unrestrained combat that players were promised, and the objective is winning.

611
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:11,051
So, you notice by the way that they might spend a little bit of time in unrestrained combat.

612
00:27:11,071 --> 00:27:13,312
You're not doing political play all the time, but there's enough of it

613
00:27:13,692 --> 00:27:15,372
that this probably isn't what the players signed up for.

614
00:27:17,773 --> 00:27:19,954
So what can we do? What out are our options?

615
00:27:20,914 --> 00:27:23,295
Well, that is where these four techniques will come into play.

616
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,462
Games have faced curse problems throughout time.

617
00:27:28,822 --> 00:27:31,503
Often, of course, people didn't know that they were facing them.

618
00:27:31,923 --> 00:27:33,984
Sometimes they didn't even know they were facing a hard problem at all

619
00:27:34,025 --> 00:27:38,267
because they naturally found their way into a way to address some previous hard problem.

620
00:27:38,947 --> 00:27:43,870
But along the way, nonetheless, designers have made sacrifices needed to address these problems.

621
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:48,732
And really, I think these sacrifices really bucket nicely into four techniques.

622
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,781
You don't really have to worry about it too much here.

623
00:27:51,801 --> 00:27:52,621
This is what they'll look like.

624
00:27:52,641 --> 00:27:53,762
This looks absurd.

625
00:27:54,022 --> 00:27:54,863
I know, it sounds absurd.

626
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:57,024
Barriers, gates, carrots, and s'mores.

627
00:27:57,125 --> 00:27:58,486
Those are the four techniques I'll talk about.

628
00:27:58,506 --> 00:28:00,547
I'm going to go through them one by one so that they make sense.

629
00:28:02,368 --> 00:28:02,569
All right.

630
00:28:03,109 --> 00:28:04,430
So the first technique is barriers.

631
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:08,493
This is cutting affordances that allow players to break promises.

632
00:28:08,533 --> 00:28:11,355
Basically, if a player is doing something that we don't want them to do,

633
00:28:11,755 --> 00:28:13,777
just make it impossible, if you can.

634
00:28:14,177 --> 00:28:16,439
And then they're going to have to spend time in the grassy happy land.

635
00:28:17,356 --> 00:28:18,197
So let's look at an example.

636
00:28:18,597 --> 00:28:20,540
For free-for-all politics, one thing you can do

637
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,462
is limit players' agency over one another.

638
00:28:23,603 --> 00:28:24,745
So for example, in a foot race,

639
00:28:25,486 --> 00:28:26,647
it's very hard to play politics

640
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:27,748
because you can't do anything

641
00:28:27,788 --> 00:28:29,671
to affect the other player's state for the most part.

642
00:28:31,146 --> 00:28:32,608
But there are software examples too.

643
00:28:33,228 --> 00:28:37,093
Battle royale games are actually kind of an incredible innovation in free-for-all games

644
00:28:37,634 --> 00:28:41,980
because players are so far apart and there's so much hidden information and there are so

645
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:47,847
many players and lethality is so high that it's just not viable to play a political game.

646
00:28:47,927 --> 00:28:49,868
I can't be like, ah yeah, I know which player I'm going after.

647
00:28:49,888 --> 00:28:52,670
I mean, maybe you can, but it would be an insane idea.

648
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:54,410
And you can't make alliances with people

649
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:55,891
because they might just shoot you at any moment.

650
00:28:56,011 --> 00:28:57,472
You can try to do these things, but it's basically

651
00:28:57,512 --> 00:28:58,272
not a viable option.

652
00:28:58,352 --> 00:29:00,533
Instead, you're forced to play hard.

653
00:29:00,813 --> 00:29:02,895
You play the game of shooting and jumping around and

654
00:29:02,915 --> 00:29:03,255
bullying.

655
00:29:03,695 --> 00:29:04,976
That is what this game promised.

656
00:29:05,656 --> 00:29:07,957
It's limited your agency over other players, basically,

657
00:29:07,977 --> 00:29:08,998
through spreading you apart.

658
00:29:09,738 --> 00:29:11,479
And as a consequence, you don't get politics.

659
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:15,020
So now the important part is, remember I said you always

660
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:15,841
sacrifice something.

661
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:18,550
even if it's a subtle implied goal.

662
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:21,091
In this case, what you sacrifice is some of the

663
00:29:21,131 --> 00:29:22,731
PvP fantasy of control.

664
00:29:23,551 --> 00:29:25,952
A big part of PvP games, many of them, is being like,

665
00:29:26,072 --> 00:29:28,052
I own you, you are gonna do what I say,

666
00:29:28,072 --> 00:29:29,833
and I can take you down exactly the path

667
00:29:29,873 --> 00:29:30,553
I want to take you down.

668
00:29:31,153 --> 00:29:32,013
And this just isn't really,

669
00:29:32,033 --> 00:29:33,094
it's definitely not possible foot race,

670
00:29:33,134 --> 00:29:36,274
and it's sort of not possible for most of a battle royale game.

671
00:29:36,595 --> 00:29:38,035
You've limited agency over each other,

672
00:29:38,055 --> 00:29:41,156
and so naturally players cannot impact each other as much.

673
00:29:42,316 --> 00:29:42,456
Okay.

674
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,662
So now let's see a second example, which I call gates.

675
00:29:46,162 --> 00:29:48,965
Gates are basically a softer touch version of barriers.

676
00:29:49,325 --> 00:29:51,627
You don't completely lock the player out of the actions that

677
00:29:51,647 --> 00:29:54,810
might allow the promises to break, but you do make them

678
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:55,930
very difficult to perform.

679
00:29:56,431 --> 00:29:59,113
And challenge is something we get to add in wherever we see

680
00:29:59,153 --> 00:29:59,834
appropriating games.

681
00:29:59,874 --> 00:30:01,735
It's a nice, specific affordance of the medium.

682
00:30:02,776 --> 00:30:05,959
So for example, you might spend most of your time not

683
00:30:06,219 --> 00:30:07,941
in political play, but players might figure out a way to do

684
00:30:07,961 --> 00:30:08,381
it a little bit.

685
00:30:09,895 --> 00:30:13,838
So in the case of Free-for-All Politics, one thing we can do is limit visibility of players'

686
00:30:13,858 --> 00:30:14,219
success.

687
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:20,563
So in PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale, which I was a technical designer on, it's

688
00:30:20,603 --> 00:30:22,605
another brawler for a player brawler.

689
00:30:22,625 --> 00:30:25,827
One of the things we did was we hid the player's scores.

690
00:30:26,207 --> 00:30:29,310
Notice there's no score in here listed, and not only did we hide it, we actually made

691
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:30,791
it harder for players to reason about.

692
00:30:31,211 --> 00:30:33,713
Your score in this game is twice your kills minus your deaths.

693
00:30:34,468 --> 00:30:37,871
So that means that it's kind of hard to play this game,

694
00:30:37,891 --> 00:30:39,893
play as hard as you can, and also keep track of everybody's score

695
00:30:39,933 --> 00:30:40,733
and know who's in the lead.

696
00:30:41,274 --> 00:30:43,515
And moreover, you sort of have this plausible deniability

697
00:30:43,535 --> 00:30:44,796
that lets you just go hard.

698
00:30:44,816 --> 00:30:46,798
Because you're like, nobody knows how well I'm doing.

699
00:30:46,858 --> 00:30:49,020
Like, I'll just go ahead and just kick as much ass as I want.

700
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:52,903
And that's what lets players play freely and not go as hard into politics.

701
00:30:54,918 --> 00:30:55,559
So what do we give up?

702
00:30:56,339 --> 00:31:00,363
Well, among other things, we give up some of the tension of buzzer beaters.

703
00:31:00,403 --> 00:31:03,546
We don't get these situations where we know all the players are really, really close together

704
00:31:03,566 --> 00:31:04,327
and you wonder who's going to win.

705
00:31:04,347 --> 00:31:06,489
Because you kind of just don't know.

706
00:31:06,509 --> 00:31:09,972
And then the game ends, and you're like, oh, turns out Jerry won.

707
00:31:10,112 --> 00:31:10,292
OK.

708
00:31:12,354 --> 00:31:14,676
So the third example is carrots.

709
00:31:15,664 --> 00:31:17,666
This is where, you know, we change the objective.

710
00:31:17,686 --> 00:31:20,448
If the objective is what's drawing them through these problematic states,

711
00:31:21,269 --> 00:31:23,210
let's change it or let's create some new goals

712
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:25,672
that help keep them following these objectives

713
00:31:26,133 --> 00:31:28,174
all the way to the goal

714
00:31:28,434 --> 00:31:29,996
without spending time doing political play.

715
00:31:31,937 --> 00:31:33,659
So, how can we do this with free-for-all games?

716
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:35,820
One way is to add metagame effects.

717
00:31:36,541 --> 00:31:38,783
This is kind of not a well-known technique, I think,

718
00:31:38,843 --> 00:31:41,665
but, you know, I found my way here through using this framework

719
00:31:41,685 --> 00:31:42,966
and I looked for examples of games that did it.

720
00:31:43,997 --> 00:31:48,816
So an interesting case, it's actually in a tournament context, for settlers of Catan tournaments.

721
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:52,713
They don't use, you know, whether or not you won a game

722
00:31:52,954 --> 00:31:54,314
to determine your placement in the tournament

723
00:31:54,534 --> 00:31:55,315
and how you move through it.

724
00:31:55,735 --> 00:31:58,337
They actually use your performance in an individual game.

725
00:31:58,757 --> 00:32:00,438
So if you win a game, you get four points.

726
00:32:01,038 --> 00:32:03,099
But if you get third place, you get two points.

727
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,160
And all of these points end up determining

728
00:32:05,241 --> 00:32:06,521
how you move through the tournament

729
00:32:06,861 --> 00:32:07,722
and how well you perform.

730
00:32:08,262 --> 00:32:09,763
So this weird thing happens

731
00:32:09,783 --> 00:32:11,584
where I'm not so incentivized to play politics

732
00:32:11,604 --> 00:32:13,705
because I don't care as much who wins or who loses.

733
00:32:14,026 --> 00:32:16,287
What I really care about is raising my own performance up.

734
00:32:16,507 --> 00:32:18,828
Just getting from third place to second place is, like, great for me.

735
00:32:19,764 --> 00:32:22,606
And I think politics is naturally diminished as a consequence.

736
00:32:23,887 --> 00:32:25,228
But there's also the side effect,

737
00:32:25,668 --> 00:32:29,090
which is you kind of diminish the magic circle of an individual game.

738
00:32:30,091 --> 00:32:33,753
Right? Like, the game doesn't have this win or lose clarity.

739
00:32:33,793 --> 00:32:36,535
It's just kind of like, oh, OK, more points for the point bucket

740
00:32:36,835 --> 00:32:38,996
that's going to end up determining maybe what I really care about,

741
00:32:39,056 --> 00:32:40,177
which is whether I win the tournament.

742
00:32:41,518 --> 00:32:41,718
All right.

743
00:32:42,381 --> 00:32:46,823
So the fourth technique, again I'm going to say these are pretty much all you can do to deal with curse problems,

744
00:32:48,243 --> 00:32:48,784
is s'mores.

745
00:32:49,244 --> 00:32:53,325
Which is to say, okay, players are violating the promises that we think we're making for them,

746
00:32:54,086 --> 00:32:56,827
but maybe we can just make that fun. Maybe we can lean into that so much

747
00:32:57,307 --> 00:33:01,348
that the promise kind of dissipates and players understand that they're playing a different game.

748
00:33:01,368 --> 00:33:06,991
So you basically give them marshmallows to melt in the fire and then you got s'mores. Yeah, okay.

749
00:33:08,171 --> 00:33:10,532
So, you know, players will spend their time here and it's still great.

750
00:33:11,797 --> 00:33:15,278
So, how do you do that with free-for-all games?

751
00:33:15,978 --> 00:33:17,719
Well, you've probably seen games like this before.

752
00:33:17,739 --> 00:33:20,059
You can give players tools to actually lean

753
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,460
into that political play, make it really deep and fun,

754
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,641
through, for example, adding secrecy,

755
00:33:24,681 --> 00:33:27,101
which is sorely missing from brawlers.

756
00:33:28,902 --> 00:33:31,763
Especially if you don't mind your players

757
00:33:31,803 --> 00:33:33,643
never being friends again, you can give them diplomacy.

758
00:33:34,869 --> 00:33:37,091
And they'll have a great time for one game.

759
00:33:38,932 --> 00:33:39,992
And you know, what happens here is like,

760
00:33:40,012 --> 00:33:42,774
they have this incredible game of Game of Thrones-esque intrigue.

761
00:33:43,014 --> 00:33:44,315
And you can see it right there on the box.

762
00:33:44,375 --> 00:33:47,177
It says, The Game of International Intrigue.

763
00:33:47,417 --> 00:33:48,297
It's very intriguing.

764
00:33:48,698 --> 00:33:51,059
But the consequence is that you have this

765
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,841
lack of emphasis on moment-to-moment action.

766
00:33:54,161 --> 00:33:56,162
Right? It's not so much about exactly where I place my units.

767
00:33:56,202 --> 00:33:59,084
It's really about the relationships I break along the way.

768
00:33:59,104 --> 00:33:59,144
So.

769
00:34:02,436 --> 00:34:05,677
And I also want to call out, by the way, that first example that I showed you of creating

770
00:34:05,717 --> 00:34:07,158
smash through weakening promises.

771
00:34:07,978 --> 00:34:10,379
This is another example of s'mores.

772
00:34:10,439 --> 00:34:13,401
We've said, okay, we had these hard promises that this game seemed to imply.

773
00:34:13,481 --> 00:34:17,262
What can we do to change our game so the game itself no longer makes those promises to the

774
00:34:17,302 --> 00:34:17,522
player?

775
00:34:18,363 --> 00:34:20,124
So another instantiation of s'mores.

776
00:34:21,724 --> 00:34:21,944
Okay.

777
00:34:22,545 --> 00:34:24,365
So you've seen the four techniques.

778
00:34:24,665 --> 00:34:26,746
Barriers, gates, carrots, and s'mores.

779
00:34:27,829 --> 00:34:31,673
I want to call out that these are, they are general purpose design techniques.

780
00:34:31,953 --> 00:34:34,996
It's not like you can't use these for uncursed problems.

781
00:34:35,537 --> 00:34:37,959
The thing that I think is interesting is that this is sort of all you can do

782
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,460
in a cursed problem setting.

783
00:34:41,015 --> 00:34:43,955
I really want you to think of this as a tiny design framework.

784
00:34:44,176 --> 00:34:47,216
Something to apply when you get into certain kinds of situations.

785
00:34:47,896 --> 00:34:49,737
It's not going to tell you how to do the work.

786
00:34:50,157 --> 00:34:51,877
You're not going to be like, oh god, what do I do?

787
00:34:51,977 --> 00:34:53,658
Oh, I know carrots, now I know how to solve this problem.

788
00:34:54,398 --> 00:34:56,718
But it gives you a structure for a difficult creative process.

789
00:34:56,758 --> 00:34:58,098
This has worked for me many times.

790
00:34:58,118 --> 00:35:01,459
I'm looking at a problem and I actually think through these four categories.

791
00:35:01,539 --> 00:35:03,760
It prompts my brain to think about directions.

792
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,980
that I never would have gone down otherwise.

793
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,321
Because your brain doesn't want to make these sacrifices, right?

794
00:35:08,341 --> 00:35:10,742
It wants to solve the problem exactly as defined, and it can't.

795
00:35:11,302 --> 00:35:12,443
So you need something to tell you, like,

796
00:35:12,483 --> 00:35:13,963
hey, have you, you know, considered, like,

797
00:35:14,003 --> 00:35:15,184
refinancing your home or something?

798
00:35:16,344 --> 00:35:17,965
So, um, that's it.

799
00:35:18,545 --> 00:35:20,626
Now I'm just gonna give you a few more examples.

800
00:35:20,646 --> 00:35:21,426
That's all we're doing right now.

801
00:35:21,446 --> 00:35:23,627
We're just doing examples so you can build intuition

802
00:35:24,167 --> 00:35:25,668
for how these techniques work.

803
00:35:26,348 --> 00:35:28,369
And I'm gonna show you exactly one more example

804
00:35:28,389 --> 00:35:29,069
for each of the techniques.

805
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:31,930
I already showed you all four techniques

806
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:33,191
on free-for-all politics.

807
00:35:33,997 --> 00:35:37,561
But now I'm going to do two for another problem and two for one after that, just in the interest of time.

808
00:35:37,681 --> 00:35:39,984
You can apply all of these techniques to all of these problems.

809
00:35:40,765 --> 00:35:42,468
So I'll talk about the co-op abuse problem.

810
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:45,031
This sucks.

811
00:35:46,925 --> 00:35:53,127
So high stakes co-op games often involve a lot of terrible treatment between players.

812
00:35:53,827 --> 00:35:57,789
And I think, you know, as game developers we have a responsibility to do what we can to make this better.

813
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:07,512
And some of this, as Meg Giantso eloquently said yesterday, involves, you know, telling the worst players, like the Nazis, to get the fuck out of our games.

814
00:36:08,152 --> 00:36:11,093
But there also is, I think, we have a responsibility as designers as well.

815
00:36:11,894 --> 00:36:13,794
to say like what can we do in our games

816
00:36:14,315 --> 00:36:16,596
to make this behavior less likely.

817
00:36:17,336 --> 00:36:19,937
Now unfortunately, it feels like there's this fundamental incompatibility.

818
00:36:21,358 --> 00:36:23,039
Players want to play to win, right?

819
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:25,600
These games signal themselves as sort of win-oriented.

820
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,922
But a lot of players also, they come for social belonging.

821
00:36:29,622 --> 00:36:31,983
The reason why you're playing a co-op game, among others,

822
00:36:32,043 --> 00:36:33,744
is because you want to feel like a part of something.

823
00:36:34,678 --> 00:36:36,459
These two things, they often don't go well together

824
00:36:36,499 --> 00:36:38,900
because players who want to play to win will not be satisfied.

825
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:42,761
Human beings feel like a game is fair when they win 70% of the time.

826
00:36:42,781 --> 00:36:44,982
And that's probably not going to happen in your PvP game.

827
00:36:45,483 --> 00:36:48,884
So if that player also is lacking anger management skills

828
00:36:48,944 --> 00:36:51,265
and tends to blame others more than themselves...

829
00:36:52,297 --> 00:36:54,577
You're gonna get them feeling dissatisfied and frustrated.

830
00:36:54,597 --> 00:36:58,059
The social belonging needing player wants psychological safety,

831
00:36:58,339 --> 00:36:59,719
needs it for that to happen,

832
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,660
but these things don't go together.

833
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,721
And I say sometimes here because it depends on the player,

834
00:37:03,801 --> 00:37:05,061
depends on the player's state of mind.

835
00:37:05,641 --> 00:37:07,262
It feels like there's this fundamental tension

836
00:37:07,402 --> 00:37:09,363
in any co-op game that has high stakes,

837
00:37:09,683 --> 00:37:10,683
PVP or otherwise.

838
00:37:12,124 --> 00:37:14,045
But of course, so the problem is curse,

839
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,625
but of course as I said there are things you can do.

840
00:37:15,765 --> 00:37:17,586
You just need to be willing to give something up

841
00:37:17,826 --> 00:37:19,326
if you really, really want to go down this path.

842
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:23,964
By the way, it was funny, totally independently,

843
00:37:24,024 --> 00:37:25,665
a couple of my colleagues at Riot,

844
00:37:26,886 --> 00:37:28,027
Naomi MacArthur and Kenny Shores,

845
00:37:28,047 --> 00:37:29,869
gave a talk yesterday or the day before,

846
00:37:30,089 --> 00:37:31,430
Impact of Social Systems in Game Design

847
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:32,251
and Player Interactions.

848
00:37:32,691 --> 00:37:33,852
She talked about a similar topic,

849
00:37:34,213 --> 00:37:37,876
what you can do in your design to de-emphasize player abuse.

850
00:37:38,216 --> 00:37:39,057
That's a cool one to check out.

851
00:37:40,818 --> 00:37:45,702
So, we're gonna look at barriers now.

852
00:37:46,983 --> 00:37:47,404
All right, so.

853
00:37:48,526 --> 00:37:50,588
One approach is to just limit player communication.

854
00:37:51,129 --> 00:37:51,289
Right?

855
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:52,190
Uh...

856
00:37:53,091 --> 00:37:55,033
And you can see a great example of that in a game like Journey.

857
00:37:55,353 --> 00:37:57,475
It's not a high-stakes co-op game, but we can still learn from it.

858
00:37:58,376 --> 00:37:58,997
They basically said,

859
00:37:59,017 --> 00:38:01,899
hey, we want to create an online game in which everyone can have a beautiful time together

860
00:38:01,919 --> 00:38:03,381
and they cannot treat each other like shit.

861
00:38:03,941 --> 00:38:04,362
And they did it.

862
00:38:04,402 --> 00:38:07,545
They made this game where basically you can run around and walk and jump and make beautiful pings.

863
00:38:08,086 --> 00:38:09,447
And you feel connected to someone.

864
00:38:09,567 --> 00:38:11,049
And it's a huge success.

865
00:38:11,916 --> 00:38:15,019
And you can generalize this to PvP games, even though we

866
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:15,680
haven't seen much of it.

867
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:18,483
I think Apex Legends is proof that you can, because they

868
00:38:18,523 --> 00:38:22,428
have such a kind of communicative ping system that

869
00:38:22,448 --> 00:38:25,251
you could easily imagine just turning off voice and text

870
00:38:25,271 --> 00:38:27,193
communication in this game entirely and still

871
00:38:27,233 --> 00:38:27,994
having a great game.

872
00:38:28,815 --> 00:38:31,898
The sacrifice here, among others, is the rich social

873
00:38:31,918 --> 00:38:33,100
channel for relationship building.

874
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:36,463
Like, we play co-op games.

875
00:38:36,623 --> 00:38:39,706
One of the reasons is so that we can build relationships,

876
00:38:39,766 --> 00:38:40,207
make friends.

877
00:38:40,227 --> 00:38:42,189
And it's very hard to practice disclosure when you

878
00:38:42,209 --> 00:38:43,229
can't use your words.

879
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:46,833
So maybe there's some way to tie this together into a game

880
00:38:46,853 --> 00:38:48,434
that slowly opens up into more communication.

881
00:38:48,494 --> 00:38:50,896
But you see that we are giving something up by doing this.

882
00:38:52,677 --> 00:38:54,438
Alright, so technique two is gates.

883
00:38:55,118 --> 00:38:57,419
Can we make it difficult to abuse each other?

884
00:38:57,939 --> 00:38:59,240
And yeah, I mean, one way to do this

885
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,941
is to limit individual responsibility.

886
00:39:02,122 --> 00:39:03,822
And Heroes of the Storm, I think,

887
00:39:03,862 --> 00:39:04,923
does this very intentionally.

888
00:39:05,203 --> 00:39:06,844
They take the MOBA formula and they say,

889
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:09,105
let's have players share responsibility more.

890
00:39:09,145 --> 00:39:10,646
Let's make it so everybody contributes

891
00:39:10,666 --> 00:39:12,947
to a shared gold pool, for example.

892
00:39:13,407 --> 00:39:17,550
And as a consequence, I don't even know who is doing well and who is doing poorly, at least on this front.

893
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:22,593
And it makes it that much harder for me to pick someone out to abuse, to blame my problems on.

894
00:39:23,574 --> 00:39:26,616
There's an even more extreme example of this in something like, a game like Werewolf or Mafia,

895
00:39:27,056 --> 00:39:32,840
or any social deduction game in which, you know, one of the teams doesn't know who else is on their team.

896
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:35,982
It's really hard for me to flame at you for not helping me out,

897
00:39:36,002 --> 00:39:37,923
if I don't even know that you're supposed to be helping me out.

898
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:41,132
At the end of the game, players may all hate each other, but at least during the game,

899
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:42,272
it's all kosher.

900
00:39:42,953 --> 00:39:46,655
So here we give up some of the fantasy of harmonious cooperation, right?

901
00:39:47,155 --> 00:39:52,038
Like because players are less individualized, there is less of that Ocean's Eleven feeling

902
00:39:52,058 --> 00:39:55,880
of like, you know, I'm using my bomb skills and you're using your not werewolf skills

903
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:59,623
or whatever they are, and each of us is coming together to contribute individually to this

904
00:39:59,963 --> 00:40:00,823
fantasy of cooperation.

905
00:40:02,407 --> 00:40:04,710
Okay, so we saw barriers and gates for co-op abuse.

906
00:40:05,351 --> 00:40:08,195
Now, we are going to see carrots and s'mores

907
00:40:08,315 --> 00:40:10,278
for what I call the quantified creativity problem.

908
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,821
So this is The Sims 4.

909
00:40:12,941 --> 00:40:15,044
It's an example of a creative game with goals.

910
00:40:16,903 --> 00:40:20,947
Now, I had this experience when I bought The Sims when I was a teenager that might resonate

911
00:40:20,967 --> 00:40:23,709
with you, which is I was super excited by it initially.

912
00:40:23,849 --> 00:40:27,393
I loved the, you know, the weird storytelling and the relationships and building crazy houses

913
00:40:27,853 --> 00:40:28,374
and so on.

914
00:40:29,154 --> 00:40:34,399
But slowly I got sucked into what almost felt like another game, which was the rat race

915
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:36,221
of improving my Sims career.

916
00:40:36,682 --> 00:40:38,724
And he was a scientist and I really, really wanted to get him to level 10.

917
00:40:38,764 --> 00:40:40,946
Because when he got to level 10, he was an astronaut.

918
00:40:41,246 --> 00:40:44,189
And I was so excited and finally I got there and I spent all this time and all this effort

919
00:40:44,209 --> 00:40:47,472
just focusing on leveling him up and, you know, living the life I needed to to get him

920
00:40:47,512 --> 00:40:47,673
there.

921
00:40:48,013 --> 00:40:50,075
And he goes into space and I'm like, yes.

922
00:40:50,435 --> 00:40:53,258
And he comes down and like I think both of us got post-space depression.

923
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:57,082
because it was like, what's left to do now?

924
00:40:57,122 --> 00:40:57,882
We got there, right?

925
00:40:57,942 --> 00:40:59,023
Like, my life dream is complete.

926
00:40:59,524 --> 00:41:01,765
And I noticed I completely forgot about what initially

927
00:41:01,805 --> 00:41:05,168
interested me about the game, which was this creative play,

928
00:41:05,188 --> 00:41:08,010
this wild storytelling and fun and expressiveness.

929
00:41:08,851 --> 00:41:12,794
And this is the problem, is players see a game like this.

930
00:41:13,014 --> 00:41:14,235
They want to express themselves.

931
00:41:14,255 --> 00:41:15,557
The game clearly signals they should.

932
00:41:16,117 --> 00:41:18,159
But the game also wants to draw them in with goals.

933
00:41:18,699 --> 00:41:20,461
And that ends up making players want to progress their

934
00:41:20,481 --> 00:41:22,923
character or whatever form the progression takes.

935
00:41:23,829 --> 00:41:28,951
And these things are in conflict because expressing yourself involves following intrinsic goals,

936
00:41:29,011 --> 00:41:30,852
kind of like following your heart, basically.

937
00:41:31,792 --> 00:41:36,274
And progressing your character involves following extrinsic goals, doing what the game says

938
00:41:36,294 --> 00:41:36,694
you should do.

939
00:41:36,834 --> 00:41:38,075
And it's pretty well known that...

940
00:41:39,075 --> 00:41:42,297
Extrinsic goals tend to subsume intrinsic goals, right?

941
00:41:42,437 --> 00:41:44,758
The more time I spend focusing on getting those carrots,

942
00:41:44,858 --> 00:41:46,899
the less I really care about what I came for in the first place.

943
00:41:46,959 --> 00:41:47,539
It's just kind of...

944
00:41:47,939 --> 00:41:49,620
Seems to be a rule of thumb in games and in life.

945
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,320
So these two things don't go together.

946
00:41:51,841 --> 00:41:52,641
The problem is cursed.

947
00:41:53,321 --> 00:41:57,203
And note that The Sims is obviously a wildly successful game, as I said,

948
00:41:57,563 --> 00:42:00,824
but I suspect that the players who really latch onto this game

949
00:42:01,064 --> 00:42:03,165
are the ones who completely ignore the progression, right?

950
00:42:03,185 --> 00:42:04,386
For whom it basically does nothing,

951
00:42:04,746 --> 00:42:06,506
and who just really focus on that self-expression.

952
00:42:07,511 --> 00:42:10,876
And I think the designers clearly here want to create a game in which both of these things

953
00:42:10,916 --> 00:42:13,159
can come together, right, into this harmonious union.

954
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,983
So can we do this with these techniques?

955
00:42:17,025 --> 00:42:17,726
Let's try carrots.

956
00:42:19,708 --> 00:42:21,351
So can we incentivize players to be creative?

957
00:42:22,904 --> 00:42:25,266
Well, yeah, we can actually give them concrete reasons to be creative.

958
00:42:25,306 --> 00:42:28,528
And this is super weird, because this is going to turn your game into a very different game.

959
00:42:28,848 --> 00:42:30,830
But it might still share some of the DNA.

960
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:33,752
Like one game that kind of does this is Clash of Clans.

961
00:42:34,152 --> 00:42:37,214
It's a game about building all these towns, putting all your little stuff down, and you

962
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:40,076
can make really wild and creative shapes and layouts.

963
00:42:40,497 --> 00:42:41,838
And you actually are incentivized to.

964
00:42:42,378 --> 00:42:43,698
because you want to play off meta.

965
00:42:43,878 --> 00:42:46,739
If players are going to come at you with a specific, you know, set of armies

966
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:49,040
that are there to destroy whatever the typical maps are,

967
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:53,062
you benefit from doing this weird creative map, this weird layout, right?

968
00:42:53,082 --> 00:42:53,702
You're going to tend to win.

969
00:42:53,722 --> 00:42:56,243
It's like bringing a magic deck to a tournament that no one was prepared for.

970
00:42:57,564 --> 00:42:59,504
So, that's cool. Like, you still get to be creative,

971
00:42:59,924 --> 00:43:02,045
but the game is actually telling you to, at least to some extent.

972
00:43:03,077 --> 00:43:06,381
For a very different example, you can look at AlphaBear, which we made at SpryFox.

973
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:11,107
And this is a game, it's a word game, you spell words from tiles on a grid,

974
00:43:11,668 --> 00:43:14,871
and the tiles expire, and you want to use up all the letters before they expire.

975
00:43:15,973 --> 00:43:17,495
And there's this weird tension where players,

976
00:43:17,995 --> 00:43:20,398
they try to win this game by spelling, using all the words,

977
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:22,020
but they also...

978
00:43:22,972 --> 00:43:25,774
really like spelling funny, weird words.

979
00:43:26,015 --> 00:43:28,457
Like, that's a kind of creative self-expression to get through the game.

980
00:43:28,737 --> 00:43:30,759
And the game was not incentivizing at all.

981
00:43:31,139 --> 00:43:32,841
There was nothing pushing players towards

982
00:43:33,241 --> 00:43:34,523
this kind of fun, creative play.

983
00:43:35,403 --> 00:43:37,165
And then, for totally unrelated reasons,

984
00:43:37,645 --> 00:43:40,548
we added this Mad Libs feature that would take

985
00:43:41,229 --> 00:43:44,552
words that you spelled in the game and then put them automatically into a Mad Lib.

986
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:45,913
So you spelled YETI and it says,

987
00:43:45,993 --> 00:43:48,596
I code so that someday we can afford a YETI of our own.

988
00:43:49,459 --> 00:43:53,463
And maybe if you're really lucky, you can afford a whole town of yetis.

989
00:43:54,464 --> 00:43:55,345
That's some industry humor.

990
00:43:57,006 --> 00:43:57,327
Look it up.

991
00:43:57,467 --> 00:43:58,087
It's a bad story.

992
00:43:58,668 --> 00:43:59,448
Okay.

993
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:04,453
So the thing about what's happening here is players actually got really incentivized.

994
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:08,720
to make these funny, weird words, right?

995
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:10,201
To spell them out, even though it has nothing to do

996
00:44:10,221 --> 00:44:11,301
with the incentives of the actual game.

997
00:44:11,601 --> 00:44:14,863
We've created this sort of social, intrinsic meta-game

998
00:44:15,383 --> 00:44:18,464
around the kind of extrinsically motivated internal game.

999
00:44:18,484 --> 00:44:20,504
And even though there's no real scoring or anything

1000
00:44:20,524 --> 00:44:21,345
in this social game, you know,

1001
00:44:21,365 --> 00:44:22,565
there are likes on Twitter or whatever,

1002
00:44:22,605 --> 00:44:23,506
people would share these a lot,

1003
00:44:23,806 --> 00:44:25,206
and it felt like the players could play

1004
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:26,927
these two games simultaneously in harmony.

1005
00:44:27,227 --> 00:44:28,267
And it almost seemed like the fact

1006
00:44:28,307 --> 00:44:29,768
that they were separate games made it easier

1007
00:44:30,088 --> 00:44:31,388
to hold both of these things in their head.

1008
00:44:32,048 --> 00:44:35,390
Players really enjoyed looking forward to spelling the words that would make these math labs.

1009
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:41,152
Okay, what do you sacrifice? You sacrifice the safety of unconstrained creativity.

1010
00:44:41,912 --> 00:44:45,093
Obviously in both of these examples, I don't get to just go wild and do anything I want, right?

1011
00:44:45,113 --> 00:44:50,896
I'm really, I still am trying to win, you know, and that means I'm going to be way less expressive than I would be otherwise.

1012
00:44:52,196 --> 00:44:55,617
But maybe that's okay for you as a designer. In each of these cases, you're developing your game,

1013
00:44:55,637 --> 00:44:57,878
you have to decide what kinds of sacrifices you're willing to make.

1014
00:44:59,033 --> 00:45:01,474
Alright, for a final example, how do we use s'mores?

1015
00:45:01,494 --> 00:45:04,496
How do we say, okay, maybe the lack of creativity isn't so bad.

1016
00:45:05,957 --> 00:45:09,099
Well, you'll end up in a very different place here,

1017
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:10,960
but I claim there's still a connection.

1018
00:45:11,901 --> 00:45:14,363
You can create rich, deep goals around the simulation

1019
00:45:14,403 --> 00:45:16,664
in a game like SimCity or The Sims,

1020
00:45:17,605 --> 00:45:19,706
and maybe get a totally different game.

1021
00:45:19,726 --> 00:45:21,027
What you actually get here is Civ.

1022
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:26,731
Civilization in a weird way is SimCity with the creativity kind of sucked out.

1023
00:45:26,751 --> 00:45:30,694
It's not that you can't be creative in Civilization, it's that you wouldn't be.

1024
00:45:30,734 --> 00:45:33,897
This isn't the game you would pick because they realize that there's so much depth there

1025
00:45:33,977 --> 00:45:38,240
in the core gameplay, there's so much strategy and so many interesting constraints and goals,

1026
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:39,961
that they just lean right into it and say,

1027
00:45:39,981 --> 00:45:40,942
okay, we're going to make a different game.

1028
00:45:40,962 --> 00:45:44,284
But it still has some of that core DNA of what, say, SimCity is.

1029
00:45:44,945 --> 00:45:48,147
And, you know, you focus a lot more on winning these games

1030
00:45:48,167 --> 00:45:50,269
than you do on, like, making a really weird Civilization.

1031
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:55,134
And of course, here you've given up most of the original self-expression goal, right?

1032
00:45:55,154 --> 00:45:57,075
This is kind of the most extreme of the sacrifices.

1033
00:45:57,416 --> 00:45:59,137
But you want to know the full spectrum,

1034
00:45:59,497 --> 00:46:03,321
because you might find yourself in a really cool space by being willing to relax your goal.

1035
00:46:04,742 --> 00:46:05,983
So, that's it.

1036
00:46:06,243 --> 00:46:07,844
These examples I've shown, two examples for each.

1037
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:10,687
There are a lot more out there, but it's as much as I have time to show you,

1038
00:46:10,707 --> 00:46:12,969
so you can build this intuition for how to use these techniques.

1039
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:14,770
So to wrap up.

1040
00:46:16,442 --> 00:46:18,163
Curse problems cannot just be solved.

1041
00:46:18,483 --> 00:46:19,523
They require a sacrifice.

1042
00:46:20,204 --> 00:46:21,024
You have to give something up.

1043
00:46:22,245 --> 00:46:24,787
But, there's kind of an exciting silver lining

1044
00:46:25,047 --> 00:46:26,828
to the existence of these curse problems.

1045
00:46:27,528 --> 00:46:29,610
I've talked about what to do when you run into one, right,

1046
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:31,130
and you kind of stare it face down.

1047
00:46:32,972 --> 00:46:34,112
But you can also seek them out.

1048
00:46:35,133 --> 00:46:36,694
Curse problems are the highest hanging fruit out there.

1049
00:46:36,734 --> 00:46:37,514
Like, people are ignoring them

1050
00:46:37,534 --> 00:46:38,915
because a lot of people think they're impossible.

1051
00:46:39,729 --> 00:46:43,491
But they're also the ripest problems.

1052
00:46:43,831 --> 00:46:46,492
They have so much potential for finding new ways

1053
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:47,252
to create games.

1054
00:46:48,052 --> 00:46:51,014
And if you actually seek them out and decide to pivot a

1055
00:46:51,034 --> 00:46:53,154
little bit, you find this whole new open area.

1056
00:46:53,215 --> 00:46:54,515
So here are some challenges.

1057
00:46:55,836 --> 00:46:57,916
Just a few things that people have told me are impossible.

1058
00:46:58,157 --> 00:46:59,197
There are many more cool ones.

1059
00:47:00,097 --> 00:47:03,219
So one is making a multiplayer game with player-generated

1060
00:47:03,259 --> 00:47:06,960
content that somehow lives in harmonious balance, that isn't

1061
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:07,460
totally broken.

1062
00:47:08,842 --> 00:47:11,224
Another is creating PvP games, like I said,

1063
00:47:11,284 --> 00:47:13,546
in which all players feel there was a just outcome,

1064
00:47:14,087 --> 00:47:16,128
despite the fact that they want to win 70% of the time.

1065
00:47:17,009 --> 00:47:18,770
And the last one is a game that maintains

1066
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:20,292
a sense of mystery and discovery

1067
00:47:20,772 --> 00:47:21,553
in the age of the internet

1068
00:47:21,573 --> 00:47:22,914
in which all secrets are laid bare.

1069
00:47:23,434 --> 00:47:25,196
These sort of seem fundamentally contradictory,

1070
00:47:25,556 --> 00:47:26,857
but the idea is when you have a contradiction,

1071
00:47:26,877 --> 00:47:29,519
you only have to pull out kind of one pin of those promises

1072
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:30,920
and you get this whole wide open space.

1073
00:47:32,321 --> 00:47:36,024
So, the next time you find yourself wandering the desert,

1074
00:47:37,037 --> 00:47:40,038
This cursed to search forever for the solution to your problem.

1075
00:47:40,778 --> 00:47:41,879
And maybe with your whole team with you.

1076
00:47:43,059 --> 00:47:43,479
Stop looking.

1077
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:44,780
Turn around.

1078
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,521
There is a lush forest of possibility behind you.

1079
00:47:48,801 --> 00:47:49,041
Thanks.

1080
00:48:03,347 --> 00:48:04,728
Also please fill out your speaker forms.

1081
00:48:06,905 --> 00:48:08,988
Okay, so I think we have time for questions.

1082
00:48:09,208 --> 00:48:09,368
It's 4.48.

1083
00:48:10,149 --> 00:48:12,251
We have 12 minutes of questions available.

1084
00:48:12,552 --> 00:48:12,872
All right.

1085
00:48:13,333 --> 00:48:14,114
Does anyone have questions?

1086
00:48:21,602 --> 00:48:22,263
Hey, how's it going?

1087
00:48:22,283 --> 00:48:23,384
What's your name?

1088
00:48:23,985 --> 00:48:24,265
Ibrahim.

1089
00:48:24,686 --> 00:48:24,926
Ibrahim?

1090
00:48:25,346 --> 00:48:25,447
Cool.

1091
00:48:27,877 --> 00:48:36,465
Can I see a situation where adding monetization would conflict with the player goals and create

1092
00:48:36,485 --> 00:48:37,606
a curse problem?

1093
00:48:38,046 --> 00:48:40,028
Oh yeah, definitely.

1094
00:48:40,048 --> 00:48:44,052
I mean, that's definitely one of the canonical curse problems that I think of in the modern

1095
00:48:44,092 --> 00:48:44,332
era.

1096
00:48:44,572 --> 00:48:45,733
There are a lot of ways to frame it.

1097
00:48:45,753 --> 00:48:47,575
There are multiple pairs of promises that break.

1098
00:48:47,895 --> 00:48:49,817
Even for an individual player who...

1099
00:48:49,957 --> 00:48:53,421
Sorry, the question was, can I see monetization creating curse problems when you add it in?

1100
00:48:53,901 --> 00:48:56,683
And yeah, even for an individual player who is, you know,

1101
00:48:57,724 --> 00:49:02,267
promised this opportunity to make their game more exciting

1102
00:49:02,948 --> 00:49:06,371
by spending money, like, you can create that, right?

1103
00:49:06,531 --> 00:49:08,492
I think, like, that player might be satisfied.

1104
00:49:08,772 --> 00:49:13,496
But you sort of naturally create a fundamentally devalued experience for other players, right?

1105
00:49:13,516 --> 00:49:14,357
We're very well aware of that.

1106
00:49:14,397 --> 00:49:16,919
The fact that other players can pay to win or improve...

1107
00:49:17,867 --> 00:49:21,571
brings down the sort of feeling of value for the other players.

1108
00:49:21,751 --> 00:49:24,415
You have this natural conflict between promises, for sure.

1109
00:49:25,836 --> 00:49:28,720
Yeah, and I think it's a great area to actually try applying some of these techniques

1110
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:32,184
and figure out if you can find clever ways to make monetization work for everyone.

1111
00:49:35,248 --> 00:49:36,169
Any other questions?

1112
00:49:36,189 --> 00:49:38,632
We have another question over there.

1113
00:49:41,326 --> 00:49:43,307
Hello, thank you for the talk, it was interesting.

1114
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:44,508
Thanks, what's your name?

1115
00:49:44,668 --> 00:49:46,749
My name is Anatoly, nice to meet you.

1116
00:49:47,189 --> 00:49:54,893
I wanted to ask, are there any examples of you using this example in your actual Riot work?

1117
00:49:55,233 --> 00:49:58,275
I thought someone might ask that, and the answer is I cannot talk about it at all.

1118
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:02,637
Sorry, that's the funny thing about giving talks when you're in R&D.

1119
00:50:03,857 --> 00:50:05,798
Yeah, but thank you for asking. I'll tell you in a couple years.

1120
00:50:09,426 --> 00:50:20,155
Hi, my name is Matias. I was wondering, there was a talk during the board game design track about a defense for king making.

1121
00:50:20,415 --> 00:50:20,616
Yeah.

1122
00:50:21,236 --> 00:50:26,080
What did you think about it and do you think it's a viable approach to this curse problem?

1123
00:50:26,623 --> 00:50:28,025
So I love that talk.

1124
00:50:28,225 --> 00:50:29,907
That talk, I went to see it because I was related.

1125
00:50:29,928 --> 00:50:32,050
This is a talk by Cole, I don't know how to pronounce his name,

1126
00:50:32,111 --> 00:50:33,893
Wuerl, who was a designer on Root,

1127
00:50:34,013 --> 00:50:35,956
which is a board game that seems really cool.

1128
00:50:35,976 --> 00:50:36,697
They haven't gotten to play yet.

1129
00:50:37,358 --> 00:50:38,720
And basically he talked about kingmaking,

1130
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:40,883
which is a special case of free-for-all politics.

1131
00:50:41,564 --> 00:50:45,408
where players get so far behind in the game

1132
00:50:45,868 --> 00:50:47,010
that they know they're going to lose,

1133
00:50:47,050 --> 00:50:48,291
and the only thing they can do

1134
00:50:48,752 --> 00:50:50,233
is basically decide who's going to win.

1135
00:50:50,454 --> 00:50:52,476
That's where they get their fun from now.

1136
00:50:52,656 --> 00:50:54,799
It's considered kind of a dark anti-pattern in games,

1137
00:50:54,859 --> 00:50:56,921
and his whole talk was like a defense of kingmaking,

1138
00:50:56,961 --> 00:50:59,604
how this is actually a really cool form of gameplay

1139
00:50:59,644 --> 00:51:02,808
that's really unique and offers a lot of individual potential.

1140
00:51:04,257 --> 00:51:06,078
And yeah, the talk was awesome, and I recommend you check it out.

1141
00:51:06,618 --> 00:51:08,479
In general, so kingmaking is itself...

1142
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:12,920
It's a curse problem, but it doesn't fit the framework that I talked about,

1143
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:16,021
where experiences conflict with objectives.

1144
00:51:16,521 --> 00:51:17,602
Kingmaking is actually...

1145
00:51:18,482 --> 00:51:19,862
It's a curse that applies...

1146
00:51:21,703 --> 00:51:24,244
I'm trying to remember exactly the framing, but I think it applies across players.

1147
00:51:24,264 --> 00:51:27,906
Because you can have these curses where one player's promises are in conflict with another

1148
00:51:27,926 --> 00:51:28,246
player's.

1149
00:51:28,727 --> 00:51:30,848
And so finding solutions to it kind of is naturally harder.

1150
00:51:31,208 --> 00:51:32,669
But yeah, you can apply these techniques.

1151
00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:37,372
And you know, you can make games about kingmaking.

1152
00:51:37,712 --> 00:51:39,513
And that can be super fun.

1153
00:51:40,233 --> 00:51:45,156
He gives some good examples in that talk of games where, you know, you know that's what

1154
00:51:45,176 --> 00:51:45,676
you're there to do.

1155
00:51:45,716 --> 00:51:48,518
So it doesn't feel so bad when at the end of the game that's all you can do.

1156
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:53,156
OK, that it?

1157
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:56,485
All right, thank you so much everyone for coming.
