1
00:00:03,598 --> 00:00:11,104
Alright, thanks for coming. Before we begin, let's do a few reminders. Number one, please

2
00:00:11,204 --> 00:00:18,369
silence your phones and or noise makers. Just be polite for everyone. And number two, please

3
00:00:18,689 --> 00:00:23,212
don't forget to fill out the surveys in your email. Don't forget to check your spam folder

4
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:24,293
because sometimes it goes there.

5
00:00:26,277 --> 00:00:34,499
and yeah, I guess we'll begin. Alright, good morning everyone and thanks for coming. Welcome

6
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:41,520
to Solving Titan-Sized Problems, Evolving Titan Combat in Titanfall 2. My name is Carlos and

7
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:49,402
I'm a game designer at Respawn Entertainment. Before that I was at Infinity Ward and before

8
00:00:49,442 --> 00:00:51,582
that I was at a company called Shell Games.

9
00:00:54,733 --> 00:00:59,297
Click. Click. Here are some of the past projects I worked on.

10
00:01:00,038 --> 00:01:03,141
Most notably of course Titanfall 2, which the game we'll be

11
00:01:03,181 --> 00:01:09,928
talking about today. Couple more things before we begin. First as

12
00:01:09,948 --> 00:01:12,770
you all know, video game development is a messy process.

13
00:01:13,311 --> 00:01:15,833
And while this talk may make it seem like we just figured

14
00:01:15,893 --> 00:01:17,435
everything out, you know, just like that.

15
00:01:18,507 --> 00:01:22,371
This is really, the reality is a lot of these lessons are a

16
00:01:22,411 --> 00:01:25,414
result of trial and error and we're only really able to

17
00:01:25,474 --> 00:01:29,798
organize them in this manner after all the dust has settled

18
00:01:29,978 --> 00:01:32,120
and we can go take a look at what we've done.

19
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:37,392
Second, making games is a team effort and while I'm the guy

20
00:01:37,432 --> 00:01:40,833
standing in front of you giving this talk, a lot of what is in

21
00:01:40,873 --> 00:01:44,995
this talk represents the hard work of the different teams that

22
00:01:45,115 --> 00:01:49,897
put their work into the game. So with that, let's get started.

23
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:53,719
Button.

24
00:01:54,835 --> 00:01:56,116
So what's this talk going to be about?

25
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,138
In this talk, I'll be discussing how we evolved

26
00:01:59,178 --> 00:02:02,020
Titan Combat in Titanfall 2, and how we tackled

27
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,682
the problem of combat in a high time to kill shooter.

28
00:02:05,242 --> 00:02:06,643
We're going to be breaking down the talk

29
00:02:06,683 --> 00:02:07,904
into three major sections.

30
00:02:08,904 --> 00:02:10,866
The first section is the introduction to the problem,

31
00:02:11,286 --> 00:02:18,371
where we'll talk about kind of trying to insert

32
00:02:18,431 --> 00:02:21,212
a high time to kill game, or trying to insert

33
00:02:21,252 --> 00:02:22,753
low time to kill shooter sensibilities

34
00:02:23,214 --> 00:02:24,374
into a high time to kill game.

35
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,591
and what problems can crop up with that.

36
00:02:28,592 --> 00:02:30,413
The second part, we'll go into the solutions

37
00:02:30,453 --> 00:02:31,894
that worked for us in Titanfall 2,

38
00:02:32,634 --> 00:02:35,777
and we'll start with how we attacked this problem

39
00:02:35,797 --> 00:02:37,458
in multiplayer, and then move on

40
00:02:37,478 --> 00:02:38,879
to how this affected single player.

41
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,161
Finally, we'll discuss some pitfalls that we came across,

42
00:02:43,682 --> 00:02:47,965
or problems that we might not have completely figured out.

43
00:02:50,945 --> 00:02:54,207
real quick let's talk about titanfall 2. What is titanfall

44
00:02:54,528 --> 00:02:57,490
2? For those who don't know, titanfall 2 is a first person

45
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:03,074
shooter set in the far future in which players play as pilots. Oh

46
00:03:03,094 --> 00:03:03,274
god.

47
00:03:04,132 --> 00:03:07,796
Agile soldiers that can wall run and double jump around the battlefield.

48
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:13,201
And during the course of a match, pilots can call down titans, huge war machines designed

49
00:03:13,241 --> 00:03:16,044
for destruction, and manually control them on the battlefield.

50
00:03:16,824 --> 00:03:22,269
So titanfall is really a mix of both low time to kill gameplay in the form of pilots and

51
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:24,371
high time to kill gameplay in the form of titans.

52
00:03:26,256 --> 00:03:30,217
and a funny story, just for the purposes of this talk, I

53
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:33,378
realized when I talk about high time to kill, most people will

54
00:03:33,398 --> 00:03:36,318
think about games like Halo and Overwatch. So just for the

55
00:03:36,358 --> 00:03:39,799
purposes of this talk, when I actually say high time to kill,

56
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:44,520
I'm talking more of a 20 second or greater time to kill as

57
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,601
opposed to something, a game like Overwatch or Halo or Team

58
00:03:47,641 --> 00:03:51,602
Fortress which lives in a more like 5 to 10 second time to

59
00:03:51,642 --> 00:03:54,903
kill. So I guess in the real world...

60
00:03:56,043 --> 00:03:59,784
we would call something like Titan combat extreme high time

61
00:03:59,804 --> 00:04:02,705
to kill if we were to stick with high time to kill for team

62
00:04:02,745 --> 00:04:05,846
fortress and overwatch. But you know, like I said, I realized

63
00:04:05,866 --> 00:04:09,347
that a little late so just for this talk, that's what high time

64
00:04:09,367 --> 00:04:15,268
to kill means. Okay, so now that that's out of the way, let's

65
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:17,869
begin by talking about what exactly the problem is we're

66
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:18,249
dealing with.

67
00:04:19,997 --> 00:04:24,799
At the beginning of Titanfall 2, Titans were identified as an area in which the game could

68
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:25,600
greatly expand.

69
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:31,863
With mobility no longer being unique to the franchise, Titans were seen as a greater key

70
00:04:31,883 --> 00:04:33,784
differentiator that could really set us apart.

71
00:04:34,644 --> 00:04:41,307
The problem was that internally, Titan gameplay was largely seen as boring or lacking depth.

72
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:45,062
people would usually throw out the word mushy as a way to

73
00:04:45,102 --> 00:04:49,503
describe titan combat. And references to rockemstock and

74
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:52,765
robots were often, I hate you, you're not playing my jif.

75
00:04:56,286 --> 00:05:00,408
Rockemstock and robots was often brought up as a point of

76
00:05:00,468 --> 00:05:01,588
reference for titan fights.

77
00:05:04,267 --> 00:05:06,628
So if we were really to push Titan gameplay,

78
00:05:07,188 --> 00:05:08,949
these would be the biggest problems to solve.

79
00:05:09,329 --> 00:05:11,550
So we started asking ourselves, why?

80
00:05:12,191 --> 00:05:14,052
Why does Titan gameplay feel so mushy?

81
00:05:14,472 --> 00:05:15,452
Why does it lack depth?

82
00:05:16,113 --> 00:05:17,814
So it seemed to have all the pieces,

83
00:05:18,554 --> 00:05:21,536
guns that felt good, and rockets, and dashing,

84
00:05:21,976 --> 00:05:25,017
and the Titans even moved quickly in an agile manner,

85
00:05:25,378 --> 00:05:28,139
so it felt better to drive around in a Titan.

86
00:05:30,349 --> 00:05:32,992
So we got back to basics and really started asking ourselves

87
00:05:33,012 --> 00:05:33,793
some hard questions.

88
00:05:34,353 --> 00:05:36,656
Questions like, where does shooter depth come from?

89
00:05:37,356 --> 00:05:40,339
And we know that gameplay depth can come from having

90
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:41,280
interesting decisions.

91
00:05:41,821 --> 00:05:43,322
So where would the interesting decisions

92
00:05:43,402 --> 00:05:44,523
come from in a shooter?

93
00:05:46,766 --> 00:05:47,947
So the model we came up with.

94
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:51,142
and most of you in one way or another might be already

95
00:05:51,182 --> 00:05:54,605
familiar with this, is that shooters tend to give players

96
00:05:55,185 --> 00:05:57,547
different layers of decisions that they're making.

97
00:05:58,187 --> 00:06:00,809
And these are broken down by the amount of time players

98
00:06:00,849 --> 00:06:02,030
have to make those decisions.

99
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:05,773
So we've identified three key layers that most of the

100
00:06:05,813 --> 00:06:06,893
decisions can fall into.

101
00:06:07,594 --> 00:06:10,316
There's the atomic layer, which lives in the sub-second

102
00:06:10,856 --> 00:06:15,500
space, the, oh, I hate you so much.

103
00:06:17,062 --> 00:06:21,264
the tactical layer which lives in the ten second space and the

104
00:06:21,284 --> 00:06:24,125
strategic layer which lives in the five to ten minute space.

105
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:28,226
So we'll look at each one of these layers real quick. Atomic

106
00:06:28,266 --> 00:06:32,588
decisions live, again, these live in the sub second decision

107
00:06:32,788 --> 00:06:36,629
making space and they involve the player identifying a target

108
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:40,331
on screen and then deciding how to move their cursor over the

109
00:06:40,371 --> 00:06:42,711
target which means deciding how they're going to move their

110
00:06:42,771 --> 00:06:44,252
thumb on the thumb stick.

111
00:06:44,872 --> 00:06:46,593
and then deciding when to pull that trigger,

112
00:06:47,053 --> 00:06:48,253
hopefully killing the target.

113
00:06:48,874 --> 00:06:50,714
And these types of decisions are happening

114
00:06:51,254 --> 00:06:52,595
at a split second interval,

115
00:06:53,015 --> 00:06:54,836
so you're not really always conscious

116
00:06:54,876 --> 00:06:56,576
that you're making these decisions,

117
00:06:56,996 --> 00:06:57,797
but they are there.

118
00:06:58,457 --> 00:07:00,138
And these types of decisions have to do

119
00:07:00,218 --> 00:07:03,059
with what we call twitch skill, or hand-eye coordination.

120
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,600
So you get better by practicing and building muscle memory.

121
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:15,344
tactical decisions happen at around 10 second intervals. And usually these happen when

122
00:07:15,404 --> 00:07:19,486
players have just spawned in or maybe when you just finish clearing an area in a team

123
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:25,129
deathmatch setting. And these decisions will often involve the player assessing the current

124
00:07:25,169 --> 00:07:26,890
state of the map, where am I?

125
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:30,172
where are the enemies or where do I think the enemies are,

126
00:07:30,772 --> 00:07:33,274
and then deciding on his engagement approach.

127
00:07:33,394 --> 00:07:35,276
Okay, so if I'm over here,

128
00:07:35,836 --> 00:07:37,237
and the enemies are up in that tower,

129
00:07:37,878 --> 00:07:39,659
and there's two ways to get to that tower,

130
00:07:39,679 --> 00:07:41,420
they're probably looking at the main road

131
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:42,901
because there's a window over there,

132
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,082
so I'm gonna take this other road,

133
00:07:44,843 --> 00:07:46,204
and hopefully catch them by surprise.

134
00:07:47,665 --> 00:07:49,866
And these types of decisions often have to do

135
00:07:49,926 --> 00:07:52,308
with what people often refer to as map knowledge.

136
00:07:52,789 --> 00:07:54,130
So the more you know about the map,

137
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:56,331
the better you can be at making these decisions.

138
00:07:57,095 --> 00:07:57,158
Mmm

139
00:07:58,059 --> 00:08:01,060
Finally strategic decisions happen over a much longer

140
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,700
timeline. Sometimes over once per match, but sometimes also

141
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,981
in the middle of the match. And these decisions often involve

142
00:08:08,281 --> 00:08:12,622
things like load out selection or team composition. So like I

143
00:08:12,662 --> 00:08:15,582
said, normally you're familiar with these, you'd select them

144
00:08:15,602 --> 00:08:18,483
at the beginning of the match. But for example in a team death

145
00:08:18,543 --> 00:08:21,944
match scenario, it can happen in the middle of the match, say

146
00:08:22,504 --> 00:08:26,825
when I go on a bad losing streak or bad death streak, I might

147
00:08:26,885 --> 00:08:27,125
have to...

148
00:08:27,525 --> 00:08:30,105
reassess my load out and then go change it and change my

149
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:36,567
strategy. So really another good way to think about all these

150
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:39,627
layers is like the atomic layer will revolve around thinking

151
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:43,408
about this next bullet that I'm going to fire and the tactical

152
00:08:43,468 --> 00:08:46,409
decisions are thinking about what's the next fight I'm going

153
00:08:46,429 --> 00:08:49,129
to have and the strategic decisions are thinking about

154
00:08:49,189 --> 00:08:55,211
like what's next 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 fights I'm going to have. So

155
00:08:55,231 --> 00:08:56,771
what we really have is this kind of.

156
00:08:57,255 --> 00:09:02,278
food pyramid of interesting decisions. So you know that the atomic scale decisions are all

157
00:09:02,318 --> 00:09:08,120
the way at the bottom for shooters specifically because these are the decisions you're making a

158
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:15,583
lot of these decisions at a time or per game. So for every five atomic decisions you're making

159
00:09:15,603 --> 00:09:21,326
you're maybe making only one tactical decision. Made up numbers but you kind of get the idea.

160
00:09:21,446 --> 00:09:23,587
There's way more at the bottom than there is at the top.

161
00:09:26,768 --> 00:09:30,309
When we apply these layers to thinking about Titan combat,

162
00:09:31,109 --> 00:09:34,391
the most apparent problem is that high time to kill,

163
00:09:34,411 --> 00:09:38,752
or high TTK, it really works against

164
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:40,233
the atomic layer decisions.

165
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:41,873
And to illustrate.

166
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:47,774
Imagine we have our low time to kill shooter. I'm playing this game. There's my cursor. I find a

167
00:09:47,814 --> 00:09:54,859
guy that I want to kill. So now I'm deciding in my brain, my brain is fully engaged in moving my

168
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:00,703
thumb stick to try to get this cursor over the guy. And I'm moving it and now I'm trying to

169
00:10:00,743 --> 00:10:05,606
figure out when I'm going to pull this trigger. And I pull the trigger and then he's dead.

170
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:09,692
which means I can move on to my next decision. Or if I fail,

171
00:10:09,712 --> 00:10:12,794
then it's more likely that I'm dead and I can move on to my

172
00:10:12,854 --> 00:10:19,538
next decision anyway. Contrasting that with something

173
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:23,181
like a high time to kill game, the same thing that happens, I

174
00:10:23,221 --> 00:10:26,923
move my cursor over the guy, there he is, I make a decision

175
00:10:26,963 --> 00:10:32,326
to pull the trigger and then nothing happens. So I guess I'll

176
00:10:32,346 --> 00:10:33,687
just keep this trigger held.

177
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:37,131
And now I'm not really making any interesting decisions,

178
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:39,592
I'm just retaining the last decision that I make,

179
00:10:40,252 --> 00:10:43,074
and nothing's prompting me to make a subsequent decision.

180
00:10:43,674 --> 00:10:46,815
And that can lead to boredom and frustration,

181
00:10:47,335 --> 00:10:49,616
and this is what people commonly refer to

182
00:10:49,736 --> 00:10:51,217
as the bullet sponge problem,

183
00:10:51,857 --> 00:10:54,098
aka why bullet sponges are boring to fight.

184
00:10:55,538 --> 00:10:58,700
And in Titanfall, this is exacerbated even more by the

185
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:03,583
fact that titans take up a huge amount of screen space. So even

186
00:11:03,703 --> 00:11:06,485
putting your cursor over them is a lot less interesting than

187
00:11:06,525 --> 00:11:09,487
putting your cursor over a pilot which takes up less screen

188
00:11:09,507 --> 00:11:12,889
space. And so this is really the problem that a lot of high

189
00:11:12,929 --> 00:11:16,531
tactical shooters will rub up against. More people will, oh,

190
00:11:16,631 --> 00:11:19,533
sorry, I already said that. So we really need to solve this

191
00:11:19,593 --> 00:11:22,374
problem if we were to make titans more important for

192
00:11:22,414 --> 00:11:22,795
Titanfall 2.

193
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:28,070
Real quick, these are some other not as crucial problems that

194
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:32,214
came up during assessment. So looking at the tactical layer,

195
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:33,255
it seemed that...

196
00:11:34,265 --> 00:11:40,869
Titan combat overall, it's got some good tactical depth because our map designers build our

197
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:46,472
standard three lane maps for titans and that makes it so that it's fairly easy to predict

198
00:11:46,512 --> 00:11:51,295
where titans going to be and you can have kind of your standard traditional shooter tactical

199
00:11:51,315 --> 00:11:56,278
depth can be drawn from that. The only difference is that titans can't jump or climb anything

200
00:11:56,678 --> 00:12:01,001
so they're all really playing on a single plane so you lose a little bit of depth with that

201
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:02,722
but overall it's not the end of the world.

202
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,043
on the strategic front, we noticed that players would

203
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:11,727
often default to what we called dual purpose weapons, like the

204
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:15,991
XO-16 chain gun, which is a rapid fire hit scan weapon. And

205
00:12:16,012 --> 00:12:17,753
the reason for this is that

206
00:12:18,793 --> 00:12:21,674
In Titanfall, you're never really sure whether you're going

207
00:12:21,694 --> 00:12:25,275
to come up against a Titan or a pilot. So it turned out to be

208
00:12:25,335 --> 00:12:28,596
more advantageous for you to bring a weapon that could just

209
00:12:28,636 --> 00:12:33,738
handle both types of enemies. So it turned out to be safer. So

210
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:36,538
most people ended up picking that weapon and so that was kind

211
00:12:36,558 --> 00:12:40,419
of our weapon meta for Titanfall 1. So we'll be touching on these

212
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:43,520
along the way but the real problem to solve with regards to

213
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,501
high T2K has to do with the atomic layer.

214
00:12:48,515 --> 00:12:50,778
OK, so now that we have a greater understanding of the

215
00:12:50,818 --> 00:12:52,740
problem, we can start figuring out how

216
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,421
we're going to solve it.

217
00:12:58,648 --> 00:13:01,072
So first we'll talk about how we went about solving this in

218
00:13:01,092 --> 00:13:01,572
multiplayer.

219
00:13:02,369 --> 00:13:05,110
We decided it would be better to start solving the problem in

220
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:08,011
multiplayer because it's much easier to apply multiplayer

221
00:13:08,051 --> 00:13:10,612
depth to single player rather than the other way around.

222
00:13:11,232 --> 00:13:14,453
Single player tends to use AI logic as somewhat of a crutch,

223
00:13:16,033 --> 00:13:18,874
forcing AI to do certain things so that it helps the player or

224
00:13:18,934 --> 00:13:22,095
challenges the player in certain ways. But it's almost impossible

225
00:13:22,495 --> 00:13:26,256
to force players to do what an AI is doing, whereas it's much

226
00:13:26,337 --> 00:13:28,457
simpler to make an AI pretend to be a bad player.

227
00:13:30,744 --> 00:13:33,249
So first I want to talk about specific things that we brought

228
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:36,778
back from Titanfall 1. It wasn't all bad. So here's some

229
00:13:36,798 --> 00:13:40,747
things that we looked back and we decided we wanted to keep.

230
00:13:41,983 --> 00:13:45,087
The first is the concept of weak spots, which is basically our

231
00:13:45,127 --> 00:13:48,090
equivalent of head shots for titans. So similar to the

232
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:51,734
head shot concept, this creates a high risk, high reward zone

233
00:13:52,034 --> 00:13:55,258
that the player can aim for, which helps him with the atomic

234
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:59,843
layer. It helps him give like a higher skill, way to express a

235
00:13:59,883 --> 00:14:03,347
higher skill over other players. That gives him higher risk.

236
00:14:04,829 --> 00:14:08,050
The problem with weak spots in Titanfall 1 was that they were

237
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:10,971
only present when a titan's shield was lowered. So most of

238
00:14:11,011 --> 00:14:13,452
the time you encounter a titan, the weak spots wouldn't even be

239
00:14:13,492 --> 00:14:15,593
showing and you have to take down their shield. So you have

240
00:14:15,613 --> 00:14:18,234
this portion of gameplay where the weak spots don't exist and

241
00:14:18,254 --> 00:14:22,776
then they exist. So that was a problem for Titanfall 1 which by

242
00:14:22,836 --> 00:14:25,997
removing shields in Titanfall 2 we were able to expose the weak

243
00:14:26,037 --> 00:14:26,757
spots more often.

244
00:14:28,422 --> 00:14:31,265
The second thing we carried over from Timefall 1 was the

245
00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:34,267
concept of dashing and blocking as a form of damage

246
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:39,292
mitigation. So this video isn't playing. Wait, are you

247
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:45,056
serious? Oh there you go. Oh my god. So these skills we were

248
00:14:45,096 --> 00:14:48,199
able to add on to the atomic layer but they were not viable

249
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:52,743
due to the presence of hit scan weapons like the XO-16 which

250
00:14:52,783 --> 00:14:56,126
made it impossible to dash. But we'll talk more on that later.

251
00:15:02,815 --> 00:15:08,236
Okay. So moving on to Titanfall 2, the first thing we did was we tried to figure out if any

252
00:15:08,316 --> 00:15:15,077
other multiplayer shooters have solved the high time to kill problem. And we came up fairly

253
00:15:15,197 --> 00:15:20,638
empty handed so if anyone has any ideas, I'd love to talk about it after the talk. So instead

254
00:15:21,138 --> 00:15:25,419
we looked at other genres like street fighter.

255
00:15:26,539 --> 00:15:31,362
and MOBUS and we said, hey, these games, you know, they have high time to kill and they have

256
00:15:31,402 --> 00:15:35,365
good depth so maybe we can learn something from these games. So trying to find the

257
00:15:35,405 --> 00:15:40,790
commonality between the two, you know, it being pretty obvious that these, both of these types

258
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:47,675
of genres have the idea of preset characters or classes. And once we kind of unlocked that

259
00:15:47,715 --> 00:15:53,099
discovery, it became really clear that having titans be preset characters was going to be a

260
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:53,699
really good fit.

261
00:15:54,488 --> 00:15:58,833
because for high time to kill, it takes advantage of the

262
00:15:58,873 --> 00:16:02,717
increased face time between players. And not only that, but

263
00:16:02,957 --> 00:16:05,440
the problem we were having of titans taking up a lot of screen

264
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:09,684
space is now also somewhat of a strength since you have that

265
00:16:09,764 --> 00:16:12,848
much more screen space to visualize them. And so this is

266
00:16:12,868 --> 00:16:13,488
how that turned out.

267
00:17:16,155 --> 00:17:22,318
So obviously the nice thing with having Titan classes too is now we can kind of give players

268
00:17:22,398 --> 00:17:29,201
these common mech fantasies that are pretty popular. So we have the fire Titan, we have the

269
00:17:29,221 --> 00:17:35,523
Titan with a sword, we have a laser Titan, we have a Titan that can fly. So in a way it also

270
00:17:35,563 --> 00:17:42,746
helped us kind of achieve fantasy fulfillment for the players. But the real win with Titan

271
00:17:42,766 --> 00:17:44,867
classes was that high time to kill.

272
00:17:45,852 --> 00:17:54,641
means you have more time to assess who an enemy is and think about what tactics he might

273
00:17:54,681 --> 00:17:59,426
employ. And a lot of games like team fortress 2, they'll talk about the necessity of this

274
00:17:59,466 --> 00:18:03,770
snap read, which is that players need to be able to identify their enemies in a split

275
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:04,090
second.

276
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:06,971
thereby increasing the importance of distinct silhouettes

277
00:18:07,031 --> 00:18:10,512
for them. And for us specifically, our fights lasted so

278
00:18:10,572 --> 00:18:15,114
long that the snap read wasn't even like 100% essential. I

279
00:18:15,154 --> 00:18:17,974
mean, we still strive for good silhouettes at the end of the

280
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:21,075
day, but during dev testing, all we had to do was put the

281
00:18:21,115 --> 00:18:24,857
names over the guy's head and it was, you know, good enough.

282
00:18:24,877 --> 00:18:29,058
It was readable enough for kind of internal testing and it

283
00:18:29,098 --> 00:18:30,998
helped us kind of develop really quickly.

284
00:18:32,604 --> 00:18:39,790
In addition, high time to kill also means now that players now actually have plenty of time to think about how they can combo their abilities.

285
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:47,956
And as a good example, one of the titans, Scorch, has an ability called the Incendiary Trap, which he can throw out and ignite.

286
00:18:48,636 --> 00:18:55,141
And this on its own doesn't do anything, it just sits there, but it requires Scorch to light it up with his main weapon.

287
00:18:55,662 --> 00:19:01,166
And this is the type of ability that you would never ship in a low time to kill shooter, because it's really inefficient.

288
00:19:01,627 --> 00:19:04,776
Like you're just better off pointing your gun at the enemy and shooting him.

289
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,600
Having fixed loadouts also meant that abilities didn't have to

290
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,401
directly compete with each other for players loadout selection.

291
00:19:14,941 --> 00:19:19,142
So in an Alucard system, what would normally be on your right

292
00:19:19,202 --> 00:19:22,403
bumper, if you had four selections, four weapons there,

293
00:19:23,003 --> 00:19:26,203
normally you would want to balance all of them in such a

294
00:19:26,243 --> 00:19:29,324
way that their power level was pretty similar. Because

295
00:19:29,344 --> 00:19:31,565
otherwise players would just pick the best one all the time.

296
00:19:32,545 --> 00:19:36,826
but in a fixed load out system, my right bumper ability could

297
00:19:36,846 --> 00:19:38,687
be weaker than someone else's right bumper ability because

298
00:19:38,707 --> 00:19:41,808
you could technically transfer that power somewhere else. So

299
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:43,748
someone could have a weaker right bumper but then a stronger

300
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:48,109
primary or stronger defensive ability and so on and so forth.

301
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:54,351
It also allowed us to create more niche abilities that

302
00:19:54,451 --> 00:19:57,252
weren't necessarily useful in every single situation.

303
00:20:00,298 --> 00:20:02,419
since we're going down the road of fixed loadouts, we wanted

304
00:20:02,479 --> 00:20:05,500
each titan's abilities to synergize with each other. This

305
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,561
creates depth by allowing players to discover the

306
00:20:07,601 --> 00:20:10,662
different ways that they can use a titan's abilities. So we

307
00:20:10,702 --> 00:20:13,202
wanted to make sure that all titans were thematically

308
00:20:13,242 --> 00:20:18,684
matched, but also that all their abilities kind of, you would be

309
00:20:18,724 --> 00:20:22,485
able to think about how you could use one or two or three

310
00:20:22,525 --> 00:20:26,866
abilities together. But,

311
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:31,196
We still need to address the atomic layer problem directly.

312
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:34,879
And to do this, we found that staying away from rapid fire

313
00:20:34,899 --> 00:20:37,162
weapons actually benefited that layer.

314
00:20:38,057 --> 00:20:41,381
Low frequency, high damage attacks create spikes in the

315
00:20:41,421 --> 00:20:44,304
flow of the fight where players can have small moments of

316
00:20:44,364 --> 00:20:45,205
success and failure.

317
00:20:45,766 --> 00:20:48,509
So this also mimics kind of the low time to kill dynamic

318
00:20:48,969 --> 00:20:52,353
since the acquire aim fire loop is completed after each

319
00:20:52,393 --> 00:20:54,996
shot is made, since the lack of rapid fire capabilities

320
00:20:55,036 --> 00:20:57,999
means that the player needs to reacquire the target after

321
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:58,800
each shot.

322
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:04,122
So this also allows for better rhythm in the fight

323
00:21:04,642 --> 00:21:06,503
since it creates pauses between the shots.

324
00:21:06,863 --> 00:21:09,144
So players can have time to assess the situation

325
00:21:09,865 --> 00:21:12,566
between each of his enemy's shots.

326
00:21:13,126 --> 00:21:14,347
So let's take a look real quick.

327
00:21:15,027 --> 00:21:17,869
First, we're going to take a look at two videos real quick.

328
00:21:18,229 --> 00:21:22,431
The first video is the XO-16 chain gun,

329
00:21:22,451 --> 00:21:23,452
the infamous XO-16 chain gun.

330
00:21:23,492 --> 00:21:27,053
Kind of the only thing that comes out of that.

331
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:55,474
So in that video you'll see the guy with the exo-16, he's just running around pointing

332
00:21:55,494 --> 00:21:58,357
the gun at his enemy and there's really no new decision points.

333
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:03,300
that he's triggering. Other than the fact that maybe A, when he

334
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:06,082
reloads, he might think about taking cover then because he

335
00:22:06,122 --> 00:22:09,684
can't DPS at that point. Or B, when his enemy pulls up a

336
00:22:09,724 --> 00:22:13,107
shield, because then he might think about, well that enemy can

337
00:22:13,147 --> 00:22:16,108
damage me but I can't damage him so maybe I should break away.

338
00:22:16,529 --> 00:22:19,391
But as far as his aiming and shooting, it's fairly

339
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:21,652
uninteresting. You can see he's just pointing and then just

340
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:23,873
casually turning and nothing's really changing.

341
00:22:25,968 --> 00:22:29,415
Now let's contrast that with the next video which is our more

342
00:22:30,176 --> 00:22:31,298
low frequency attacks.

343
00:22:58,368 --> 00:23:03,096
So in this one you can see after each shot he's having to reassess what he's doing,

344
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:08,485
reacquire his target which makes for a more interesting kind of play pattern for his

345
00:23:08,545 --> 00:23:09,186
primary weapon.

346
00:23:12,232 --> 00:23:14,414
But that doesn't mean that we don't have rapid fire weapons.

347
00:23:14,534 --> 00:23:17,338
Because the good thing about rapid fire weapons is that

348
00:23:17,358 --> 00:23:18,799
they're really good for new players.

349
00:23:20,161 --> 00:23:21,723
They're really easy to use.

350
00:23:21,783 --> 00:23:24,646
So it provides a way for new players to get into your game

351
00:23:25,006 --> 00:23:26,468
and immediately start having fun.

352
00:23:26,789 --> 00:23:28,591
So we didn't want to completely give up that

353
00:23:28,651 --> 00:23:29,271
accessibility.

354
00:23:30,072 --> 00:23:35,075
but what we did was we made sure that the titans that had rapid fire weapons would have

355
00:23:35,115 --> 00:23:40,099
something else in their loadout that could compensate and create depth. So a good example is

356
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:49,285
the titan ion. His primary weapon is a rapid fire rifle but his right shoulder, sorry let me do

357
00:23:49,305 --> 00:23:52,708
it again. His primary weapon is a rapid fire rifle but it's really weak.

358
00:23:53,494 --> 00:23:55,815
And his secondary, which is a shoulder laser,

359
00:23:56,475 --> 00:24:00,877
is a one-time, kind of high-impact skill shot

360
00:24:01,518 --> 00:24:03,479
that deals a lot of damage.

361
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:05,360
So that's, so, as an Ion player,

362
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,000
you're gonna, you're really,

363
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,301
you're really using your splitter rifle

364
00:24:09,321 --> 00:24:11,342
to just kind of throw jabs at your opponent,

365
00:24:11,362 --> 00:24:12,483
but what you really want to do

366
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:14,604
is hit him with your strong laser.

367
00:24:15,544 --> 00:24:16,585
And so here's what that looks like.

368
00:24:36,412 --> 00:24:39,937
So in this video in particular, you'll see the first laser shot

369
00:24:39,997 --> 00:24:42,721
was missed and that was pretty crucial. If he would have hit

370
00:24:42,761 --> 00:24:45,705
that laser shot, this Titan would have been doomed and he

371
00:24:45,725 --> 00:24:51,234
could have gone in for the execution. As mentioned

372
00:24:52,472 --> 00:24:54,473
blocking and dashing was something we carried over from

373
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:58,994
Titanfall 1 but we realized that this only really works when

374
00:24:59,074 --> 00:25:01,774
everyone's weapons are projectile based. Projectile

375
00:25:01,794 --> 00:25:04,815
weapons have travel time and that time is essential for

376
00:25:04,855 --> 00:25:08,615
players to be able to respond to it. So combining projectile

377
00:25:08,655 --> 00:25:12,296
weapons with slow fire weapon designs, damage mitigation

378
00:25:12,336 --> 00:25:19,978
becomes a much more viable concept in Titanfall 2. Next.

379
00:25:22,139 --> 00:25:25,600
But projectile weapons tend to be really difficult to use,

380
00:25:26,061 --> 00:25:28,842
especially combined with the fact that many of our weapons

381
00:25:28,922 --> 00:25:32,524
were not rapid fire. So to help with this, we have tech called

382
00:25:32,624 --> 00:25:37,287
fat projectiles that we can apply. And what this does is it

383
00:25:37,347 --> 00:25:40,229
gives our projectiles width, making it easier to hit targets

384
00:25:40,269 --> 00:25:43,851
with them. The nice thing with this tech was that it was also

385
00:25:43,931 --> 00:25:47,673
used for pilot weapons and it allowed us to create non-hit

386
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:50,654
scan weapons for pilots that could go toe to toe with the

387
00:25:50,694 --> 00:25:51,255
assault rifle.

388
00:25:54,404 --> 00:25:57,507
But hitscan can still exist.

389
00:25:58,087 --> 00:26:00,149
And a good example of this is one of the Titans Legion

390
00:26:00,169 --> 00:26:00,910
who has a minigun.

391
00:26:02,411 --> 00:26:04,493
But his minigun has a built in spin up time.

392
00:26:04,674 --> 00:26:07,076
So that compensates for the lack of travel time

393
00:26:07,096 --> 00:26:07,937
in his projectiles.

394
00:26:08,417 --> 00:26:10,459
And we do a lot of work to change his silhouette

395
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,021
depending on his weapon state.

396
00:26:12,761 --> 00:26:14,423
So players can easily read whether or not

397
00:26:14,463 --> 00:26:15,224
he's ready to fire.

398
00:26:16,085 --> 00:26:16,505
In addition.

399
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:22,617
This also makes positioning way more important for a Legion player, so we kind of accept that he'll

400
00:26:22,637 --> 00:26:27,863
have less engaging atomic decisions. That's okay since we've traded it for an increased dependence

401
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:33,830
on his tactical decisions. Video.

402
00:27:06,275 --> 00:27:10,700
Another thing that we did was design abilities that created permanents on the battlefield.

403
00:27:11,261 --> 00:27:15,045
Scorch's loadout in particular features abilities that linger for some amount of time,

404
00:27:15,565 --> 00:27:20,731
so it forces his opponent to constantly kind of rethink his position, or it pushes his opponent out of position.

405
00:27:22,633 --> 00:27:24,776
And something we realized...

406
00:27:25,455 --> 00:27:28,837
was that abilities, sorry, rather, something we realized

407
00:27:28,877 --> 00:27:32,759
was that titan fights would often last a long time and

408
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:35,920
titans would often play in the same space. So having something

409
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,782
that can change the meaning of that space would help keep those

410
00:27:38,822 --> 00:27:42,684
fights fresh. Some other examples of this, of permanence

411
00:27:42,704 --> 00:27:47,727
that we made were the cluster missile, particle wall, the

412
00:27:48,547 --> 00:27:52,609
scorches incendiary trap, or the laser trip mines for ion. So

413
00:27:53,639 --> 00:27:57,482
But static permanents are good, but we found that permanents

414
00:27:57,543 --> 00:28:00,865
that move in a slow, predictable path are even better.

415
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:03,668
So the slow moving part is important because you want

416
00:28:03,728 --> 00:28:05,349
these permanents to last a good amount of time

417
00:28:05,389 --> 00:28:08,312
on the battlefield, or enough time that players can react

418
00:28:08,332 --> 00:28:09,413
to them in a meaningful way.

419
00:28:10,173 --> 00:28:12,916
So if they move too quickly, they'll end up hitting a wall

420
00:28:12,976 --> 00:28:14,958
or flying by your opponent, and then they're basically

421
00:28:14,998 --> 00:28:15,758
gone at that point.

422
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:20,302
And we came upon this discovery when we made this ability

423
00:28:20,342 --> 00:28:21,163
called the Arc Ball.

424
00:28:21,885 --> 00:28:28,269
which oddly enough didn't ship as a titan weapon. The arc ball or the thunderbolt, that's the

425
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:32,853
pilot version of this weapon but this specifically is the arc ball. This is an ability that

426
00:28:32,893 --> 00:28:40,458
launches a slow moving projectile. Can you see my pen? No you can't see my pen. Can you see my

427
00:28:40,499 --> 00:28:48,204
cursor? So this is our slow moving projectile as you can see. And you can see this

428
00:28:48,264 --> 00:28:51,347
projectile kind of zaps the opponent that's within range of it.

429
00:28:53,585 --> 00:28:56,608
So when we play tested this, we found that it really added an

430
00:28:56,708 --> 00:29:00,412
extra kind of, an extra layer that would really change the

431
00:29:00,913 --> 00:29:03,375
dynamic of the fight, but only for a certain amount of time.

432
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:06,859
So here's what that looks like in practice.

433
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,004
If this video would play.

434
00:29:13,406 --> 00:29:14,047
Maybe if I click.

435
00:29:35,818 --> 00:29:40,119
So you can see in that video there's multiple ways to kind of use the arc ball not just to

436
00:29:40,139 --> 00:29:44,560
damage your opponent but to force him into certain bad situations that you can take advantage of.

437
00:29:45,501 --> 00:29:49,682
And this kind of mimics hopefully this GIF will play.

438
00:29:53,773 --> 00:29:55,394
Oh, I hate you so much.

439
00:29:57,735 --> 00:30:01,337
Yes, so this mimics what in Street Fighter people,

440
00:30:02,077 --> 00:30:03,798
the slow fireball in Street Fighter,

441
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,760
which players can use to,

442
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,221
I think they call it fireball zoning.

443
00:30:08,521 --> 00:30:10,842
So what it does is it forces their opponents

444
00:30:10,923 --> 00:30:12,103
to react to the fireball

445
00:30:12,423 --> 00:30:14,445
and possibly put themselves in a bad position.

446
00:30:20,217 --> 00:30:23,119
Finally, the last element that we worked on was improving our

447
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:27,302
Titan's core abilities. In Titanfall 1, core, sorry, in

448
00:30:27,342 --> 00:30:31,485
Titanfall core abilities are essentially supers or alts. They

449
00:30:31,546 --> 00:30:34,828
are ultra low frequency moves that can have a high impact on a

450
00:30:34,868 --> 00:30:38,831
battle. Titanfall 1 had core abilities, but they were mostly

451
00:30:38,871 --> 00:30:42,133
things like double damage or increased health, which were

452
00:30:42,194 --> 00:30:45,396
okay, but they didn't really create the spikes in gameplay

453
00:30:45,416 --> 00:30:48,518
that you would want from an ultra low frequency attack.

454
00:30:49,204 --> 00:30:53,567
For Titanfall 2, we had to rethink our core abilities to be more attack-like,

455
00:30:53,967 --> 00:30:58,850
with the goal of having them create opportunities to tip stalemates or create reversals.

456
00:31:00,111 --> 00:31:02,853
One thing that we wanted to make sure when designing these abilities, though,

457
00:31:03,273 --> 00:31:05,275
was that they weren't instant win buttons.

458
00:31:05,835 --> 00:31:10,498
We still wanted the notion of allowing players to express skill when using these core abilities.

459
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:17,160
So there's the idea of being able to use a core ability poorly and being able to use it well.

460
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:23,344
The best example of this is Ion's laser core which has wind-up time to warn the opponent

461
00:31:23,384 --> 00:31:28,808
that it's going to happen and when it activates the attacker has slowed movement and he has

462
00:31:28,828 --> 00:31:33,611
disabled dash and a slowed turn speed. So a player has to make a judgment on whether or

463
00:31:33,651 --> 00:31:38,074
not it's a good time to use that ability. This also opens up a new type of gameplay.

464
00:31:39,416 --> 00:31:43,599
which is commit and punish, which is something that you find in fighting games a lot.

465
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:48,263
So when, in fighting games, when someone does a specific move, a character will commit to a

466
00:31:48,303 --> 00:31:53,587
certain movement and could possibly expose himself that can, and that the enemy can exploit.

467
00:31:53,607 --> 00:31:59,772
So here's what that looks like for us, if the video would play.

468
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:22,136
Ion laser core activated.

469
00:32:23,237 --> 00:32:27,919
Ion laser core activated.

470
00:32:27,959 --> 00:32:37,025
We're not ahead by much. Let's pick up-

471
00:32:37,145 --> 00:32:37,745
Just a snack.

472
00:32:44,419 --> 00:32:48,242
So what we're really doing here with all these changes is we're

473
00:32:48,282 --> 00:32:51,165
trying to create new decisions for the player to make outside

474
00:32:51,205 --> 00:32:54,408
the atomic layer. So we kind of just made this new layer, which

475
00:32:54,428 --> 00:32:58,952
for now I'm calling the technique layer. And the

476
00:32:58,972 --> 00:33:02,655
technique layer is this loop of decisions that occur in roughly

477
00:33:02,695 --> 00:33:06,078
two second windows. And they have to do with assessing the

478
00:33:06,158 --> 00:33:09,441
current board state, so not the whole map, but just this fight

479
00:33:09,501 --> 00:33:10,022
in front of you.

480
00:33:11,342 --> 00:33:13,003
and thinking about what abilities you have,

481
00:33:13,483 --> 00:33:14,824
what abilities the enemies have,

482
00:33:15,205 --> 00:33:16,606
and then executing your next move.

483
00:33:17,666 --> 00:33:19,327
Somewhere in there, you're also thinking about

484
00:33:19,868 --> 00:33:22,209
your cool downs and trying to figure out

485
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:24,651
whether or not your next available ability

486
00:33:25,031 --> 00:33:26,993
is something that you can possibly combo

487
00:33:27,033 --> 00:33:28,134
your current abilities with.

488
00:33:30,613 --> 00:33:35,557
And this layer is sort of present in low time to kill shooters, although it's very underplayed,

489
00:33:36,118 --> 00:33:39,201
and it's present in the form of grenades as a pre-engagement attack.

490
00:33:39,701 --> 00:33:44,105
So in a low time to kill shooter, if I know that there's an enemy in the next room,

491
00:33:44,646 --> 00:33:48,749
I could throw a grenade in there and increase my chances of winning that fight

492
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:51,932
by pushing the enemy out of position prematurely,

493
00:33:52,272 --> 00:33:55,415
and then going in knowing that he would be out of position when I walk in.

494
00:33:59,917 --> 00:34:05,099
Okay, so now that we've built our combat depth in multiplayer, we can fairly easily, or, you

495
00:34:05,399 --> 00:34:12,941
know, we can apply this depth to single player. So, when we started working on Titan Combat in

496
00:34:12,981 --> 00:34:17,762
single player, our first instinct was just to assume everything would work great. We spawn a

497
00:34:17,782 --> 00:34:23,783
bunch of Titans, we, you know, lay out combat the way we normally do, no problem. However,

498
00:34:24,511 --> 00:34:28,012
ran into the problem of combat fatigue where players would

499
00:34:28,092 --> 00:34:31,974
often get pretty tired after a titan fight. So to solve that,

500
00:34:32,914 --> 00:34:36,916
we experimented with what we called weak titans. And that's

501
00:34:36,956 --> 00:34:41,057
a concept where presumably we would say that auto titans would

502
00:34:41,077 --> 00:34:45,339
be easier to kill than say piloted titans. And you know,

503
00:34:45,539 --> 00:34:46,279
when we implemented it,

504
00:34:47,276 --> 00:34:52,143
At first it felt great. I go play a fight and I kill a bunch of weak titans and then

505
00:34:52,203 --> 00:34:58,371
eventually once in a while I'll fight a non-weak titan. So people were reporting that they

506
00:34:58,411 --> 00:34:58,992
were having fun.

507
00:35:00,463 --> 00:35:05,986
But we let it sit for a couple months and after further

508
00:35:06,026 --> 00:35:09,168
inspection we realized that being able to move through a

509
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:13,791
bunch of titans in a row, it really made titans feel weak.

510
00:35:14,991 --> 00:35:16,692
Like they weren't special anymore and they're too

511
00:35:16,732 --> 00:35:21,055
disposable. In addition we had all these cool behaviors from

512
00:35:21,075 --> 00:35:24,137
multiplayer that weren't being showcased because the titans

513
00:35:24,157 --> 00:35:25,017
would die so easily.

514
00:35:27,452 --> 00:35:30,796
So we scrapped that idea and instead split the difference. We

515
00:35:30,836 --> 00:35:33,939
increased the health back to the original values and then pushed

516
00:35:33,959 --> 00:35:38,924
the differences in health. So that's our empty health and this

517
00:35:38,964 --> 00:35:42,387
is what the health values look like in single player. So the

518
00:35:42,428 --> 00:35:45,350
light chassis has around half the health of its multiplayer

519
00:35:45,371 --> 00:35:47,913
counterpart and the medium chassis has around 80% health.

520
00:35:49,369 --> 00:35:53,013
Now, a 50% light chassis health, it's still a decent amount,

521
00:35:53,033 --> 00:35:54,355
so they can definitely still have some time

522
00:35:54,375 --> 00:35:55,236
to use their abilities.

523
00:35:56,177 --> 00:35:59,601
At 50% health, I believe fighting a Ronin on average

524
00:36:00,102 --> 00:36:03,866
still takes the player around 15 or 12 seconds.

525
00:36:04,647 --> 00:36:06,429
So this allowed, but, pah.

526
00:36:07,527 --> 00:36:10,271
This also allowed designers to tune fights a little bit better.

527
00:36:10,812 --> 00:36:13,155
So if you wanted an easier fight,

528
00:36:13,615 --> 00:36:16,379
you would drop a couple of light titans,

529
00:36:16,419 --> 00:36:17,641
like a Ronin or a North Star.

530
00:36:18,362 --> 00:36:20,445
And we found that good fights usually

531
00:36:20,485 --> 00:36:23,709
were comprised of maybe one heavy titan with a couple

532
00:36:23,729 --> 00:36:25,011
of light titans backing him up.

533
00:36:26,488 --> 00:36:29,069
But in general we still found that fights were pretty tiring.

534
00:36:29,629 --> 00:36:32,931
So we needed to break up titan fights even further

535
00:36:33,531 --> 00:36:36,373
with kind of infantry sections or reaper sections.

536
00:36:36,673 --> 00:36:37,733
So if you don't know what a reaper is,

537
00:36:37,873 --> 00:36:39,794
he's kind of like a half titan.

538
00:36:40,194 --> 00:36:45,737
He's got like one chunk of this health

539
00:36:46,638 --> 00:36:47,738
and he's half the height of a titan.

540
00:36:47,758 --> 00:36:49,439
So he can die pretty quickly to a titan.

541
00:36:51,577 --> 00:36:58,000
So these kind of infantry sections prove to be good not

542
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:01,321
just to break up the fights but to sell the scale of titans as

543
00:37:01,381 --> 00:37:05,583
well. Because if I'm a titan and all I come across are big

544
00:37:05,603 --> 00:37:09,325
titans, I don't really get the sense that I'm this giant robot.

545
00:37:09,405 --> 00:37:11,546
I just, everything is my size so whatever.

546
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:21,353
So since we ended up with high-ish health titans, we

547
00:37:21,453 --> 00:37:26,076
generally tried to have titans fights be like 1v1 or 1v2, 1v3.

548
00:37:26,596 --> 00:37:29,498
And this allows players to focus on the enemy titans more,

549
00:37:30,038 --> 00:37:32,860
since we also found that players had a lot more face time

550
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:37,283
with enemy titans than in low time to kill games. So this

551
00:37:37,583 --> 00:37:40,385
increased face time means that we had all this time to play

552
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:43,066
with, so we used it to give enemy titans more personality.

553
00:37:44,045 --> 00:37:46,886
it was a good opportunity to kind of build a relationship

554
00:37:46,946 --> 00:37:50,048
between the player and the enemy he would be fighting. And to do

555
00:37:50,088 --> 00:37:54,711
that we wrote a system called the VEU system that would detect

556
00:37:54,771 --> 00:37:57,913
player actions and make enemy titans respond accordingly. The

557
00:37:58,073 --> 00:38:01,135
idea was that when you were fighting an enemy titan, that

558
00:38:01,175 --> 00:38:04,456
titan's pilot would have an open communications line with you and

559
00:38:04,517 --> 00:38:07,898
he would taunt you and stuff. So it would do things like when the

560
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:10,180
player damages an enemy a certain amount he would respond

561
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,901
by saying, oh, how dare you.

562
00:38:13,275 --> 00:38:17,537
or if the player used his core ability, the enemy would say something about that too.

563
00:39:15,565 --> 00:39:17,667
Stronger than I thought, not by much though.

564
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:21,091
It's been fun, pilot.

565
00:39:21,831 --> 00:39:30,800
Salvo core away.

566
00:39:33,702 --> 00:39:34,183
So real quick.

567
00:39:34,769 --> 00:39:40,374
Let's talk a little more about our Titan AI. Again, since players are now spending more time

568
00:39:40,834 --> 00:39:45,698
with each enemy, they have a lot more time to notice AI behaviors. So it became worthwhile to

569
00:39:45,738 --> 00:39:52,623
invest in a more robust AI system. In designing our AI Titans, we decided to go the route of

570
00:39:52,683 --> 00:39:57,327
Street Fighter bot fights. So we like that when you fight against a bot in Street Fighter, all

571
00:39:59,616 --> 00:40:03,139
normal thought processes that you would go through when fighting a player still applied.

572
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:09,125
More or less to fighting a bot. So our titan AI generally tries to act like a player and

573
00:40:09,165 --> 00:40:14,089
they follow the same rules as a player. They'll only block or dash once you've fired and

574
00:40:14,149 --> 00:40:17,853
having projectile weapons again here will help because they can take advantage of that

575
00:40:17,893 --> 00:40:19,194
travel time to make that decision.

576
00:40:21,132 --> 00:40:23,413
They also follow the same cool down rules for their abilities

577
00:40:24,053 --> 00:40:28,374
so it's also possible to bait certain abilities out of an

578
00:40:28,454 --> 00:40:32,155
enemy and then counter with your own attack. Nice thing is these

579
00:40:32,215 --> 00:40:36,616
titans are used both in multiplayer and single player but

580
00:40:36,656 --> 00:40:39,577
single player just adds a layer of characterization on top of

581
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:41,498
the multiplayer AI.

582
00:40:44,541 --> 00:40:47,422
The last thing I want to talk about is our AI boss battles. In

583
00:40:47,442 --> 00:40:51,204
Titanfall 2, spoilers, players will fight a number of boss

584
00:40:51,244 --> 00:40:53,545
characters which are the different mercs that Blisk has

585
00:40:53,565 --> 00:40:57,307
hired to help him. Due to time constraints, we didn't have

586
00:40:57,347 --> 00:41:00,328
enough time to hand strip each boss battle like how we would

587
00:41:00,408 --> 00:41:03,489
usually think of a traditional boss fight. Instead, we

588
00:41:04,337 --> 00:41:09,941
Our bosses just use the same system as our other titans, but they're just more aggressive about using their abilities.

589
00:41:10,561 --> 00:41:18,386
And what I mean by that is that our normal titans will usually wait a little bit after their ability is ready before they actually use it.

590
00:41:18,947 --> 00:41:23,089
But our boss titans will try to use their abilities as soon as they're available.

591
00:41:25,711 --> 00:41:30,834
But, we still wanted to make our boss battles feel more special, and there are a few things we did for that.

592
00:41:31,675 --> 00:41:32,115
So one...

593
00:41:33,352 --> 00:41:37,113
is all our bosses have these cool intro cutscenes

594
00:41:37,513 --> 00:41:38,834
that showcase their personality,

595
00:41:39,354 --> 00:41:41,855
and with the exception of a few special cases,

596
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:44,656
this is the only time we actually see

597
00:41:45,016 --> 00:41:46,676
cutscenes in Titanfall 2.

598
00:41:48,436 --> 00:41:51,857
Two, bosses have regenerating shields just like the player.

599
00:41:52,558 --> 00:41:55,219
Not only does this make them harder to fight or deal damage

600
00:41:55,259 --> 00:41:59,421
to, but it also enables them to act just a little bit smarter

601
00:41:59,441 --> 00:42:01,442
than other titans, since they'll also

602
00:42:01,482 --> 00:42:02,542
try to preserve their shield.

603
00:42:02,922 --> 00:42:05,944
So a boss titan will try to retreat behind cover

604
00:42:06,964 --> 00:42:08,405
to try to get his shield back.

605
00:42:09,857 --> 00:42:16,259
Bosses also have doom state which is an extra layer of health that puts a titan in kind of an

606
00:42:16,359 --> 00:42:21,081
executable state. And we removed this for our normal titans because again it extended their

607
00:42:21,101 --> 00:42:26,222
health too much. But it seemed appropriate for bosses to have. The nice thing is this also

608
00:42:26,282 --> 00:42:31,364
makes it so that bosses are the only ones, only titans that can get executed. And each boss

609
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:34,105
actually has a special execution animation tied to him.

610
00:42:35,892 --> 00:42:38,954
Finally, boss titans have extra video call outs that they can

611
00:42:39,114 --> 00:42:43,137
use and they have a special pool of just taunt dialogue that

612
00:42:43,157 --> 00:42:46,820
they can say if they haven't said anything in a while. So

613
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:49,602
they'll call out, in addition they'll also call out if they're

614
00:42:49,622 --> 00:42:52,744
being aggressive or defensive so they seem just a little bit

615
00:42:52,784 --> 00:43:00,770
smarter. So let's see what that looks like. You were not invited

616
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:03,392
to Kane's party and that's why you're dead.

617
00:43:05,204 --> 00:43:12,745
Well, well, another runaway hero with an SRS Vanguard class Titan.

618
00:43:13,265 --> 00:43:18,886
Now we're talking!

619
00:43:19,086 --> 00:43:20,787
Let's get this party started, Scrub.

620
00:43:22,227 --> 00:43:23,887
Walk away, Scrub, just walk away.

621
00:43:24,027 --> 00:43:26,468
Only a matter of time before I rip you out of that cockpit anyway.

622
00:43:29,668 --> 00:43:30,688
Target hit, Fox 8.

623
00:43:30,728 --> 00:43:34,109
Nice try, love, but I'm no pushover.

624
00:43:36,798 --> 00:43:40,800
Die, Clannah-Mother!

625
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,840
Alright, I'm ready for more.

626
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:45,901
Goodbye, you little bastard.

627
00:43:45,941 --> 00:43:48,922
Dodge this.

628
00:43:52,723 --> 00:43:53,703
He's using the core. So predictable.

629
00:43:53,723 --> 00:44:01,685
You should not have done that, pilot.

630
00:44:01,905 --> 00:44:03,586
And it's got core break hard shit, too.

631
00:44:07,885 --> 00:44:15,688
Destroyed by some pitiful excuse for a pilot.

632
00:44:15,728 --> 00:44:16,208
No! No!

633
00:44:16,228 --> 00:44:16,368
No!

634
00:44:16,388 --> 00:44:26,892
Micro One lost control. I'm losing control. Going down. Mayday, Mayday. Going down.

635
00:44:27,052 --> 00:44:29,273
End of break.

636
00:44:46,089 --> 00:44:51,552
Overall, I think given the circumstances, it worked out pretty well. I think the fact that the

637
00:44:51,592 --> 00:44:57,916
bosses actually use normal AI makes our boss fights feel kind of less scripted and more real

638
00:44:58,076 --> 00:44:59,076
than the traditional ones.

639
00:45:00,097 --> 00:45:01,698
I do think there's a lot of improvement though,

640
00:45:02,298 --> 00:45:03,779
and I think there may be a middle ground

641
00:45:04,219 --> 00:45:06,580
where we can have our boss titans use their AI,

642
00:45:07,021 --> 00:45:09,502
but designers can script in special events

643
00:45:09,562 --> 00:45:10,983
to sell the spectacle.

644
00:45:11,523 --> 00:45:13,104
And you get a little bit of a glimpse of that

645
00:45:13,604 --> 00:45:14,905
in the Viper fight in our game.

646
00:45:14,985 --> 00:45:17,987
So the Viper fight is one that was more special scripted

647
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:19,888
because the designer for that really wanted to do it,

648
00:45:20,228 --> 00:45:21,469
and he's the one that flies around

649
00:45:21,529 --> 00:45:23,229
and does a special core ability

650
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:24,930
that doesn't appear in multiplayer.

651
00:45:26,291 --> 00:45:27,212
So I think in the future,

652
00:45:27,572 --> 00:45:29,113
I would try to push more in that direction.

653
00:45:32,402 --> 00:45:35,624
Finally, let's talk about the unexpected problems that we ran

654
00:45:35,664 --> 00:45:39,146
into during development and some of these problems we haven't

655
00:45:39,166 --> 00:45:41,467
even really figured out the solution for but these are just

656
00:45:41,667 --> 00:45:46,189
things to watch out for. The biggest pitfall in the direction

657
00:45:46,229 --> 00:45:48,910
we took was that all these different loadouts really

658
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:50,731
increased the complexity of Titan combat.

659
00:45:52,259 --> 00:45:54,460
By introducing the skill of ability combos

660
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:59,022
and enemy recognition, we created a potentially greater

661
00:45:59,082 --> 00:46:02,223
skill gap between players that played the game a lot

662
00:46:02,263 --> 00:46:04,504
and know all the characters and the players that don't.

663
00:46:05,565 --> 00:46:07,806
And this can be partially solved by good matchmaking,

664
00:46:07,966 --> 00:46:10,527
so we don't ever put two players of different skill levels

665
00:46:10,587 --> 00:46:13,228
in a match together, but matchmaking can only really

666
00:46:13,248 --> 00:46:16,190
go so far, so I think more work needs to get put into that.

667
00:46:18,287 --> 00:46:21,089
Other league games such as league or street fighter, they

668
00:46:21,109 --> 00:46:25,051
do a lot of work both inside and outside the game to give players

669
00:46:25,191 --> 00:46:27,852
access to information about their characters. We did a

670
00:46:27,912 --> 00:46:31,294
little bit of this with intro videos for the titans but I

671
00:46:31,334 --> 00:46:34,155
think there's still a lot more we can do. Something like a

672
00:46:34,216 --> 00:46:38,077
training room or a certification course would be ideal so that

673
00:46:38,097 --> 00:46:40,519
players have a safe space to practice using their loadout.

674
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,362
Another thing that added to this was that when we started

675
00:46:46,402 --> 00:46:47,162
working on titans...

676
00:46:48,642 --> 00:46:54,665
we primarily focused on making sure players were having good 1v1 fights. And this was all well

677
00:46:54,705 --> 00:46:58,867
and good, you know, we built kind of a 1v1 map and we would play test there and just have like

678
00:46:58,907 --> 00:47:05,771
really fun 1v1 fights, or even 2v2 fights. So it was all well and good, but it became really

679
00:47:05,811 --> 00:47:11,234
disastrous when we actually played a real match of attrition, a 6v6 match of attrition, since

680
00:47:11,294 --> 00:47:15,676
players were having to deal with not just more titans, but the potential of pilots sneaking up

681
00:47:15,756 --> 00:47:16,376
on them as well.

682
00:47:17,157 --> 00:47:19,658
So this means that we actually had to tone down

683
00:47:19,718 --> 00:47:21,378
some of the more obtrusive effects

684
00:47:21,779 --> 00:47:23,939
that were again working in a 1v1 context,

685
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:28,561
but were pretty bad in kind of a 6v6 context

686
00:47:28,581 --> 00:47:29,462
where anything could happen.

687
00:47:30,042 --> 00:47:33,583
And a good example of that is North Star's plasma railgun

688
00:47:34,084 --> 00:47:36,665
used to apply a really huge knockback effect

689
00:47:36,825 --> 00:47:37,705
whenever you would get hit.

690
00:47:38,305 --> 00:47:41,046
And this was great in 1v1 since it really helped him

691
00:47:41,487 --> 00:47:44,068
force his opponent into his ideal range.

692
00:47:45,269 --> 00:47:48,692
you can imagine when playing a 6v6 match you can get tagged by

693
00:47:48,712 --> 00:47:51,214
a north star rail gun out of nowhere and all of a sudden

694
00:47:51,554 --> 00:47:55,477
you're shifted like 36 units or 3,000 units to the left and you

695
00:47:55,517 --> 00:47:58,500
don't really know why. So we had to take things like that out.

696
00:47:59,921 --> 00:48:03,805
The other problem that presented itself, sorry.

697
00:48:05,278 --> 00:48:11,221
The other problem this presented was that we also tuned health values to be, again, to be

698
00:48:11,281 --> 00:48:17,043
interesting in a 1v1 context. Our intention was to make sure the titan fights had enough time to

699
00:48:17,243 --> 00:48:21,805
feel like a real fight. Again, looking at street fighter fights as reference. In practice,

700
00:48:21,845 --> 00:48:27,328
however, we found that whenever two titans would get into a fight in a real match, they would

701
00:48:27,388 --> 00:48:29,989
effectively kind of end up going into their own little corner.

702
00:48:30,509 --> 00:48:34,211
and play out their fight that took forever and they would effectively ignore the match.

703
00:48:34,852 --> 00:48:39,214
And we had this one, I remember in particular this one event, there was this hard point

704
00:48:39,254 --> 00:48:44,458
match and I was, I got in my titan and we were running around, I tried, and I found another

705
00:48:44,478 --> 00:48:45,398
titan and we started to fight.

706
00:48:46,118 --> 00:48:49,020
And it was, the match had already finished,

707
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,200
like the victory screen went up,

708
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,180
and we were still fighting,

709
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:53,181
and the evac happened, and everyone left,

710
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:54,201
and we were still fighting.

711
00:48:54,882 --> 00:48:57,323
And like, we basically just ignored half that match.

712
00:48:58,023 --> 00:48:59,884
And so that was, we determined that

713
00:49:00,184 --> 00:49:01,164
that was not a good thing.

714
00:49:05,225 --> 00:49:09,848
This problem of complexity is exacerbated by the fact that

715
00:49:09,868 --> 00:49:12,930
you're in a titan for about only really 30 percent of the time in

716
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:16,272
titanfall. So this means that even if you wanted to practice

717
00:49:16,353 --> 00:49:19,595
using a certain titan, you would have to play this pilot game for

718
00:49:19,635 --> 00:49:22,997
a while and wait until the next one is available, which is not

719
00:49:23,037 --> 00:49:26,599
really ideal. So right now if you really wanted to practice

720
00:49:26,679 --> 00:49:29,801
using a titan, the best place to do it...

721
00:49:31,972 --> 00:49:32,692
Let's do that again.

722
00:49:33,092 --> 00:49:35,593
The best, so you really wanted to practice using a Titan,

723
00:49:36,013 --> 00:49:38,574
the best place to do that is in Last Titan Standing,

724
00:49:38,954 --> 00:49:41,095
which is a game mode that always starts you in a Titan.

725
00:49:41,635 --> 00:49:43,835
But even that game mode, it's an elimination game mode,

726
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:45,216
so you gotta wait after you die

727
00:49:45,256 --> 00:49:46,996
before you can do it again.

728
00:49:47,016 --> 00:49:50,497
In single player, this is the main reason

729
00:49:50,577 --> 00:49:53,078
why we switched to the on the fly loadout switching for BT.

730
00:49:53,972 --> 00:49:58,675
Initially, players would pick up a new loadout from enemy titans, but we ran into the problem

731
00:49:58,735 --> 00:50:03,199
that they might pick out a loadout that they didn't like, or they weren't good with, and

732
00:50:03,219 --> 00:50:05,901
then they'd basically be stuck with that loadout.

733
00:50:06,081 --> 00:50:11,085
And since it takes a long time to learn a loadout, it really disincentivizes players

734
00:50:11,125 --> 00:50:12,086
to seek out new loadouts.

735
00:50:12,106 --> 00:50:13,947
They would just stick with the ones they're comfortable with.

736
00:50:14,648 --> 00:50:18,671
With the Mega Man style loadout system, players could kind of...

737
00:50:20,356 --> 00:50:23,319
kind of try a loadout without the fear that they might not

738
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:25,262
like it, because then they can always switch back to

739
00:50:25,302 --> 00:50:26,323
something they're comfortable with.

740
00:50:26,643 --> 00:50:29,807
So at any point in time, they can just kind of dip their

741
00:50:29,827 --> 00:50:31,869
toes in and then possibly be better.

742
00:50:36,188 --> 00:50:39,169
Also in single player this pushed us to create a dynamic

743
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:42,211
hint system. So what our hint system does is it tries to

744
00:50:42,731 --> 00:50:45,813
kind of detects what you're doing in a fight and kind of

745
00:50:45,873 --> 00:50:48,435
takes a lot of data. It tries to figure out how long you've

746
00:50:48,455 --> 00:50:51,616
been in a fight and if you're only using your primary weapon

747
00:50:51,636 --> 00:50:53,938
in that fight it will signal you to use your other abilities.

748
00:50:56,357 --> 00:50:59,240
Unfortunately the system isn't super duper smart yet so

749
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:02,903
sometimes when you're taking damage it will just tell you to

750
00:51:03,083 --> 00:51:06,547
use electric smoke. Really the intention is it tells you to use

751
00:51:06,587 --> 00:51:10,711
an electric smoke and then go to cover but people didn't really

752
00:51:11,752 --> 00:51:14,114
know that all the time so there's a little bit more

753
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:19,239
improvement we can do for that in single player. Oh and also we

754
00:51:19,259 --> 00:51:20,200
should port that to multiplayer.

755
00:51:21,974 --> 00:51:25,816
Another specific thing to high time to kill is the problem that it's difficult to communicate to

756
00:51:25,856 --> 00:51:30,720
players where they made a mistake. For low time to kill gameplay we have a feature called kill

757
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:36,904
replay which will show the players their final moments before they died. This 8 second window is

758
00:51:37,084 --> 00:51:41,227
usually enough to be able to show players exactly how they died so they can do better next time.

759
00:51:41,787 --> 00:51:46,851
But high time to kill fights could last for a minute and showing the final 10 seconds of

760
00:51:46,871 --> 00:51:48,872
someone's life may not reveal anything valuable.

761
00:51:49,833 --> 00:51:53,335
In addition, players will often eject out of their Titan instead of dying,

762
00:51:53,836 --> 00:51:56,317
so they aren't even in a mindset to absorb that lesson,

763
00:51:56,357 --> 00:51:58,939
since they're still busy trying to run around shooting other Titans.

764
00:52:00,179 --> 00:52:02,541
So this one, we're still unsure of how to solve this,

765
00:52:03,021 --> 00:52:06,243
and some ideas have been brought up, like showing a feed of major damage sources,

766
00:52:06,744 --> 00:52:11,446
but I think more research needs to be put in regards to how we can present this information.

767
00:52:13,725 --> 00:52:17,627
As I mentioned the single player, when we started designing combat encounters with these

768
00:52:17,647 --> 00:52:22,549
titans, our first instinct was to lay out one fight after another similar to other shooters

769
00:52:22,569 --> 00:52:28,752
we've worked on. But we found that even after just one fight, players got pretty tired since

770
00:52:28,852 --> 00:52:34,134
titan fights are a lot more involved than pilot fights. So we had to make a conscious effort

771
00:52:34,154 --> 00:52:38,296
to space out titan fights more and insert infantry combat in between just as a pilot

772
00:52:38,316 --> 00:52:40,397
cleanser. The only exception

773
00:52:42,142 --> 00:52:46,825
is levels like trial by fire and full weapon which is this. So

774
00:52:46,865 --> 00:52:49,527
this is trial by fire. And in this level you're fighting a

775
00:52:49,647 --> 00:52:52,589
bunch of titans in a row but we have additional mechanic. We

776
00:52:52,609 --> 00:52:56,151
have friendlies in this level so they can help kind of take,

777
00:52:56,492 --> 00:52:59,133
tank the damage from other titan enemies and they can also deal

778
00:52:59,153 --> 00:53:01,815
damage to enemies so it helps you kind of just push through

779
00:53:01,835 --> 00:53:02,175
that level.

780
00:53:02,956 --> 00:53:06,919
And in this level, this is the last level, the Fold Weapon,

781
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:09,401
and in this one you also fight a bunch of Titans,

782
00:53:09,541 --> 00:53:12,684
but in this level we have a mechanic with ship bombardment,

783
00:53:13,224 --> 00:53:14,965
and that'll bombard all the enemy Titans

784
00:53:15,085 --> 00:53:16,647
and basically turn them into weak Titans,

785
00:53:16,667 --> 00:53:18,008
because now they're all damaged,

786
00:53:18,348 --> 00:53:19,169
and you can go mow through

787
00:53:19,189 --> 00:53:20,570
all those weak Titans pretty quickly.

788
00:53:23,006 --> 00:53:25,988
This is generally less of a problem for a multiplayer since

789
00:53:26,028 --> 00:53:28,949
there are less titans on the field overall due to the whole

790
00:53:29,349 --> 00:53:33,331
pilot titan pilot thing. And in last titan standing we have

791
00:53:33,371 --> 00:53:36,233
natural breaks that are the round transitions so those are

792
00:53:36,273 --> 00:53:39,734
also good cool down moments. But I imagine if you were to make a

793
00:53:39,774 --> 00:53:42,996
multiplayer game that's like high time to kill all the time,

794
00:53:43,196 --> 00:53:45,717
team death match, you would probably run up against this

795
00:53:45,757 --> 00:53:46,378
problem as well.

796
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:50,662
Finally, the last problem is more of a Titanfall

797
00:53:50,682 --> 00:53:52,745
specific problem and it has to do with regen health.

798
00:53:53,505 --> 00:53:57,190
So regen health is great because it makes type,

799
00:53:57,350 --> 00:54:00,033
you know, it'll force players into this position

800
00:54:00,053 --> 00:54:01,835
where they have to retreat, get behind cover,

801
00:54:02,235 --> 00:54:04,258
stop, think about what their next thing is gonna be.

802
00:54:06,191 --> 00:54:12,413
for Titanfall it was bad because we needed the Titans to cycle out. In Titanfall we were

803
00:54:12,433 --> 00:54:18,656
dealing with this problem called Voltron. And Voltron happens when one team gets four or

804
00:54:18,736 --> 00:54:21,136
five Titans together and they just

805
00:54:21,977 --> 00:54:25,139
gang up on one titan and they obliterate all the other team's

806
00:54:25,179 --> 00:54:30,181
titans. And now the other team has zero hope of winning the

807
00:54:30,221 --> 00:54:32,223
match because every time they bring their titan in they just

808
00:54:32,263 --> 00:54:36,865
get stomped. And in titanfall 1 this was a huge problem because

809
00:54:36,905 --> 00:54:40,667
of regenerating shields it was very difficult for the enemy

810
00:54:40,707 --> 00:54:44,910
team to even damage the titans. So removing any sort of health

811
00:54:44,930 --> 00:54:50,172
regeneration kind of helped the other team kind of bring other

812
00:54:50,212 --> 00:54:50,733
titans down.

813
00:54:54,774 --> 00:54:57,755
But again, in single player, we kept regenerating health

814
00:54:57,795 --> 00:54:59,536
because that wasn't really a concern.

815
00:55:03,538 --> 00:55:04,478
So this is the end of the talk,

816
00:55:04,578 --> 00:55:06,239
and then we'll just recap real quick.

817
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:10,441
So high time to kill negates depth at the atomic level.

818
00:55:11,061 --> 00:55:13,482
So try to push designs that embrace high time to kill.

819
00:55:13,542 --> 00:55:16,143
For us, fixed loadouts fit really well

820
00:55:16,183 --> 00:55:16,964
with high time to kill.

821
00:55:17,364 --> 00:55:19,545
They push enemy recognition and ability combos,

822
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:21,906
and that type of stuff fits really well

823
00:55:21,946 --> 00:55:23,747
with kind of the increased face time.

824
00:55:26,149 --> 00:55:27,971
Think about how to add more interesting decisions

825
00:55:28,091 --> 00:55:29,352
within and outside that layer.

826
00:55:29,953 --> 00:55:34,398
Again, for us, low frequency attacks and permanence

827
00:55:34,538 --> 00:55:38,062
were a good first step, but there could be more out there.

828
00:55:39,323 --> 00:55:41,125
Be ready to handle increased complexity

829
00:55:41,806 --> 00:55:43,248
and watch out for combat fatigue.

830
00:55:44,410 --> 00:55:46,052
Finally, I just want to point out

831
00:55:46,172 --> 00:55:48,074
that when we started this project,

832
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:49,355
High Time to Kill was kind of seen

833
00:55:49,395 --> 00:55:50,917
as a little bit of a problem child,

834
00:55:51,518 --> 00:55:53,159
and there was definitely a lot of temptation

835
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:55,262
to lower Titan health values.

836
00:55:55,922 --> 00:55:57,885
But I'm really glad that we really embraced

837
00:55:57,905 --> 00:55:59,306
the High Time to Kill nature of Titans,

838
00:55:59,727 --> 00:56:01,569
as it made us, it really pushed us

839
00:56:01,949 --> 00:56:03,991
to create something that I feel is really unique.

840
00:56:04,732 --> 00:56:08,934
in terms of shooters and it kind of opened up this new design

841
00:56:08,954 --> 00:56:12,475
space for shooters where ability design can really flourish and

842
00:56:12,515 --> 00:56:16,017
you can have more room to create more weird and kind of cool

843
00:56:16,037 --> 00:56:21,379
abilities. And I'm pretty excited for what the future

844
00:56:21,399 --> 00:56:21,819
holds for that.

845
00:56:22,638 --> 00:56:23,999
So, that's the end of the talk.

846
00:56:24,159 --> 00:56:26,642
I want to call out, just special shout out

847
00:56:27,102 --> 00:56:28,524
to these people up here.

848
00:56:29,044 --> 00:56:31,126
They, these people in particular,

849
00:56:31,146 --> 00:56:34,129
a lot of their work is also represented in this talk.

850
00:56:34,309 --> 00:56:36,011
So, Mac McCandlish, who's the lead designer.

851
00:56:36,691 --> 00:56:39,394
Stephen DeRose, who is the other guy that worked on Titans.

852
00:56:39,434 --> 00:56:41,856
He really helped push Titans to be, you know,

853
00:56:42,157 --> 00:56:43,318
super polished and shippable.

854
00:56:43,858 --> 00:56:45,980
And then, Ji Sang was the AI programmer

855
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:47,082
who worked on Titans as well.

856
00:56:49,173 --> 00:56:54,461
And that's all. I don't know, we have like four minutes for questions. Also Respawn is hiring.

857
00:57:05,035 --> 00:57:10,179
Hey, how's it going? I'm wondering if you experimented with damaged regions to offer more

858
00:57:10,219 --> 00:57:15,122
choices at the atomic level. So like I shoot off a titan's arm and it can't use a gun, I shoot

859
00:57:15,162 --> 00:57:19,845
off its chassis and it can't use its core. And if you did experiment with that, why did you not

860
00:57:19,885 --> 00:57:25,769
take that? I don't know if we experimented. We didn't experiment with that in Titanfall 2. We

861
00:57:25,809 --> 00:57:31,633
experimented with damaged regions dealing different amounts of damage but not like losing

862
00:57:31,673 --> 00:57:32,433
your arm because then.

863
00:57:33,017 --> 00:57:35,659
you basically would just be walking and then you couldn't play anymore.

864
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:40,443
You would lose a segment of gameplay that would normally be important to you.

865
00:57:41,604 --> 00:57:44,006
With regards to different damage values,

866
00:57:44,486 --> 00:57:46,848
something interesting that I didn't actually put in this talk was

867
00:57:47,228 --> 00:57:53,413
in Titanfall 2 we reduced the amount of damage buffs that the crit point gave you

868
00:57:53,913 --> 00:57:56,535
because we found that we were able to put depth in other places.

869
00:57:59,169 --> 00:58:04,650
variance in the amount of damage you can deal was bad for the guy receiving damage. He also

870
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:08,491
needed to predict how much damage he was going to receive and he can't really control where the

871
00:58:08,531 --> 00:58:13,152
guy is going to hit him. So reducing the amount of variance just kind of helped improve the

872
00:58:13,172 --> 00:58:15,233
predictability of that. Thank you for the talk.

873
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:25,242
With the balancing of all these six abilities in Titan classes,

874
00:58:25,262 --> 00:58:29,043
I was wondering if you experienced any particular challenging areas,

875
00:58:29,904 --> 00:58:35,486
and if you have any comments on any stuff you've seen shake out from the players

876
00:58:36,786 --> 00:58:37,707
life-testing it for you.

877
00:58:38,907 --> 00:58:41,548
Sorry, would you mind being more specific?

878
00:58:41,668 --> 00:58:43,469
I don't think I fully understand your question.

879
00:58:43,789 --> 00:58:45,430
Okay, I was just curious how the...

880
00:58:47,582 --> 00:58:50,284
what your experience was like balancing these six different

881
00:58:50,504 --> 00:58:51,545
like Titan classes.

882
00:58:52,726 --> 00:58:55,608
Oh, so the question that was about just in general

883
00:58:55,668 --> 00:58:57,309
balancing kind of the six classes?

884
00:58:57,589 --> 00:58:57,789
Yeah.

885
00:58:58,210 --> 00:58:59,631
Yeah.

886
00:58:59,951 --> 00:59:02,633
So I didn't, I wasn't actually the guy balancing it,

887
00:59:02,933 --> 00:59:04,495
just, you know, to put that out there.

888
00:59:05,095 --> 00:59:07,357
But overall when I think when we were making these

889
00:59:07,537 --> 00:59:10,119
Titan abilities, it was kind of a weird,

890
00:59:10,139 --> 00:59:12,401
it was, especially in its infancy,

891
00:59:12,461 --> 00:59:13,842
it was difficult to figure out.

892
00:59:14,935 --> 00:59:19,720
how many abilities a titan should have and which, there's one point in time where we

893
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:24,825
experimented with sharing, kind of maybe they should have one slot which had shared

894
00:59:24,845 --> 00:59:28,769
abilities. But it turned out it was just much better if everyone had their own unique

895
00:59:28,829 --> 00:59:35,095
thing. And then balancing them, you just play test and then if a specific thing was too

896
00:59:35,135 --> 00:59:37,818
strong you would pull it back or if it was too weak you would.

897
00:59:38,278 --> 00:59:43,304
Buffet, you know, it's all you're just getting feedback from different players and you know as if you've been in chin stock

898
00:59:43,864 --> 00:59:47,508
Both the multiplayer team play tests every day and then every week we have Friday night fight

899
00:59:47,528 --> 00:59:48,990
so we got a decent amount of feedback from

900
00:59:50,414 --> 00:59:55,656
from our dev team. And then from the live game, we look at the

901
00:59:55,716 --> 00:59:59,237
reddit, obviously that's kind of a slice of our community, trying

902
00:59:59,257 --> 01:00:02,658
to figure out if any metas has emerged and then figuring out

903
01:00:03,278 --> 01:00:06,999
what we want. We balance the live game as well. We'll change

904
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:09,420
some numbers depending on what players activities are.

905
01:00:15,942 --> 01:00:22,347
Thanks for a great talk. I was wondering in single player if you had any tricks for scaling

906
01:00:22,387 --> 01:00:27,171
difficulty without falling into some of those same traps of bullet sponges on one end or

907
01:00:27,251 --> 01:00:37,059
titans not feeling special on the other end? Specifically, well, I think once you increase

908
01:00:37,099 --> 01:00:40,302
the health, so basically what I found is you can

909
01:00:41,326 --> 01:00:44,068
once you start increasing health to bullet sponge levels,

910
01:00:44,388 --> 01:00:45,248
wait, is that your question?

911
01:00:45,428 --> 01:00:45,649
Sorry.

912
01:00:45,949 --> 01:00:48,250
Is your question, if I increase the health

913
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:49,591
to bullet sponge levels, what should I do,

914
01:00:49,751 --> 01:00:51,852
or what can I do to not increase bullet sponge levels?

915
01:00:52,793 --> 01:00:55,994
I was more curious if you had any more creative ideas

916
01:00:56,054 --> 01:00:59,356
than just scaling the health, since you pointed out

917
01:00:59,396 --> 01:01:01,297
that sort of leads to bullet sponges

918
01:01:01,418 --> 01:01:03,339
or titans not feeling special at the other end.

919
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:07,901
Well, there's, what did we do?

920
01:01:07,981 --> 01:01:08,281
We did.

921
01:01:09,071 --> 01:01:15,058
kind of shield usage which is a little bit of help but also it's just a little bit of extra

922
01:01:15,078 --> 01:01:20,164
help that they can regenerate so it also makes them feel smarter. You can play with how often

923
01:01:20,905 --> 01:01:27,954
they dash or avoid damage or block. We had one version of Titan AI when they weren't really

924
01:01:27,994 --> 01:01:28,254
tuned.

925
01:01:28,922 --> 01:01:32,725
where they would use the vortex shield and they were so good at using the vortex shield,

926
01:01:33,205 --> 01:01:36,627
they would vortex your bullets and it fired it back at you and then you would catch it

927
01:01:36,647 --> 01:01:40,550
because you saw them use it. But then you fired it back at them and they would catch it right

928
01:01:40,570 --> 01:01:44,352
away and then fire it back at you right away. So you could try to make them just be more

929
01:01:44,392 --> 01:01:49,116
aggressive with how they use their abilities too. I guess things like that. Hopefully that

930
01:01:49,176 --> 01:01:50,536
answers your question. Thank you.

931
01:01:56,767 --> 01:01:59,053
There's a wrap up room over there if anyone wants to talk

932
01:01:59,073 --> 01:02:03,604
some more. But I think people need this room. Thanks for

933
01:02:03,624 --> 01:02:03,804
coming.
