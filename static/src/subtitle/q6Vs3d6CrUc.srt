1
00:00:05,771 --> 00:00:08,953
So, hi, I'm Chris Brown and I'm giving a talk today,

2
00:00:08,953 --> 00:00:12,955
Fighting Legos, Audio Choreography for Battle Design.

3
00:00:12,955 --> 00:00:15,976
What that really means is discussing the change

4
00:00:15,976 --> 00:00:18,898
in how we record what I call vocal sound effects

5
00:00:18,898 --> 00:00:21,859
or omnis or onos,

6
00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:23,860
kinds of the sound effects that you're going to hear

7
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,961
when you're playing battle design.

8
00:00:25,961 --> 00:00:28,002
So, it means...

9
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:31,871
if this works correctly.

10
00:00:31,871 --> 00:00:34,653
Using voiceover sound effects as a game mechanic.

11
00:00:34,653 --> 00:00:37,916
We have a lot of, we used to, on carts, right,

12
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:41,279
you'd have to cut everything down to its minimum thing.

13
00:00:41,279 --> 00:00:44,641
You'd only have a binary choice,

14
00:00:44,641 --> 00:00:45,962
something like this going from this,

15
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:47,563
where we're enhancing a moment,

16
00:00:47,563 --> 00:00:49,945
somebody gives a punch, somebody receives a punch,

17
00:00:49,945 --> 00:00:51,687
it's just a small sound that lets you know,

18
00:00:51,687 --> 00:00:54,589
oh, okay, they've given or received a punch.

19
00:00:54,589 --> 00:00:57,331
We're gonna move now more into

20
00:00:57,686 --> 00:01:03,113
a world, this is a still from For Honor, where that voiceover sound effects that you're hearing

21
00:01:03,113 --> 00:01:09,061
back from the game are actually helping you to learn how to play the game and to confirm

22
00:01:09,061 --> 00:01:12,145
for you that you are playing the game correctly.

23
00:01:13,646 --> 00:01:19,988
Why so why does it matter voiceover sound effects help you play the game? Well isn't enhancement enough?

24
00:01:19,988 --> 00:01:25,790
For me. I'm always looking for ways to help people understand the world better

25
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:29,431
When I want to bring a change to the table

26
00:01:29,431 --> 00:01:32,091
People why why do we have to change? Why do we have to do it that way doesn't it?

27
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:34,752
You know if it ain't broke don't fix it

28
00:01:34,752 --> 00:01:39,193
So we kind of always go back to this. What's the purpose of sound design when we're finding?

29
00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:41,189
why we're gonna make a change,

30
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:43,231
is it gonna serve our greater mission?

31
00:01:43,231 --> 00:01:45,212
For me, the greater mission is always providing

32
00:01:45,212 --> 00:01:46,853
the information you need to know

33
00:01:46,853 --> 00:01:49,595
to interact optimally with the world.

34
00:01:49,595 --> 00:01:54,838
And again, this talk is audio bootcamp,

35
00:01:54,838 --> 00:01:58,380
so it's made for people who are coming into.

36
00:01:59,215 --> 00:02:02,238
sound design, which is why we're gonna just do a brief overview.

37
00:02:02,238 --> 00:02:06,501
When we talk about getting the information that you need to understand and

38
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,583
to interact optimally with the world,

39
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:12,646
we're looking at things that provide feelings and context for you.

40
00:02:12,646 --> 00:02:16,929
It helps you comprehend the world, it helps you be motivated.

41
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:22,113
For me, when I hear drums starting, I get fired up, I'm ready for battle.

42
00:02:22,113 --> 00:02:24,575
You have kind of these classic archetypes, right?

43
00:02:24,575 --> 00:02:27,197
Your minor chords of danger and loss, strengths of drama,

44
00:02:27,197 --> 00:02:28,638
your brass of victory kind of.

45
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,882
The things that are the standard language that we use in audio to convey

46
00:02:33,882 --> 00:02:39,005
certain emotional feelings to people to let them understand that this is what's

47
00:02:39,005 --> 00:02:45,409
going on in the game in the moment and to help them be motivated to move forward.

48
00:02:45,409 --> 00:02:48,091
When we look about ambiances, when we talk about ambiances,

49
00:02:48,091 --> 00:02:50,632
this is a still from Red Dead, as I'm sure you know.

50
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:55,340
you think about the desert, this feeling of desolation,

51
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,922
this feeling of loneliness, this aridity,

52
00:02:58,922 --> 00:03:02,744
this kind of you'll hear a lone coyote howl.

53
00:03:02,744 --> 00:03:06,245
It's always reflective of Marston's psychological state,

54
00:03:06,245 --> 00:03:11,068
this feeling of being sort of the lone person out there,

55
00:03:11,068 --> 00:03:12,849
maybe the only one who understands the world,

56
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:16,371
maybe the only one who understands the grim realities,

57
00:03:16,371 --> 00:03:18,772
the mechanisms of how the world truly functions.

58
00:03:19,509 --> 00:03:26,956
It helps to convey the sense of being very kind of lost also.

59
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:31,561
When we think about imbiances, we think also about bio shock,

60
00:03:31,561 --> 00:03:33,683
feelings of you'll hear the creaking,

61
00:03:33,683 --> 00:03:35,084
you'll hear the water.

62
00:03:35,084 --> 00:03:36,286
It's very haunting.

63
00:03:36,286 --> 00:03:38,108
And you don't, players don't really.

64
00:03:39,484 --> 00:03:42,767
sit back and say, why am I feeling creeped out all the time?

65
00:03:42,767 --> 00:03:46,009
You know, you've got these sounds, you've got the splicers coming at you, you have the,

66
00:03:46,009 --> 00:03:49,692
you know, big daddy groans, you have these sounds that are individual sounds that are

67
00:03:49,692 --> 00:03:55,777
giving you a feeling, but underneath it all you have this bed of the actual pressure,

68
00:03:55,777 --> 00:04:00,300
not only of the moment, but the pressure of the ocean on this thing that at any second

69
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,761
could break through.

70
00:04:02,761 --> 00:04:05,883
So we talk about sound, we talk about music,

71
00:04:05,883 --> 00:04:07,924
providing you feelings, context.

72
00:04:07,924 --> 00:04:12,826
We talk about ambiences, providing you feelings and context.

73
00:04:12,826 --> 00:04:16,028
When we talk about non-voiceover sound effects,

74
00:04:16,028 --> 00:04:18,989
we talk about actionable tool info, right?

75
00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:23,511
So you're looking at the Lancer, you are hearing it,

76
00:04:23,511 --> 00:04:25,512
you're hearing its power, it's kind of exciting,

77
00:04:25,512 --> 00:04:26,673
it's kind of grindy, you're like,

78
00:04:26,673 --> 00:04:28,394
how much can I F people up with this?

79
00:04:28,394 --> 00:04:28,894
It's very.

80
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:34,907
exciting and fun and not that I'd like to do that but

81
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:37,590
So right here's your garrote

82
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:41,374
Agent 47 doesn't make any sound which is important

83
00:04:41,374 --> 00:04:43,696
you have

84
00:04:44,557 --> 00:04:47,759
Oh my gosh, why am I blanking on the Warthog?

85
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:53,625
Okay, my favorite vehicle because it's small, it's light,

86
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:54,705
it revs at a slightly higher pitch,

87
00:04:54,705 --> 00:04:57,268
it lets you know, oh, this is more nimble,

88
00:04:57,268 --> 00:04:58,709
this is not heavy as a tank,

89
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:01,792
this is gonna let me go up and on crags and on rocks,

90
00:05:01,792 --> 00:05:04,174
and it's all things that, again,

91
00:05:04,174 --> 00:05:06,856
without the player really thinking about it,

92
00:05:06,856 --> 00:05:09,438
it lets them know, these are the rules of the world.

93
00:05:09,798 --> 00:05:14,640
These are things that are at my disposal that help me understand the mechanics

94
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,942
of the game design itself that help me move around.

95
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:22,123
So in that way, your sound effects are helping to fill out level design.

96
00:05:22,123 --> 00:05:24,644
It's pretty neat.

97
00:05:24,644 --> 00:05:30,927
When we think about voiceover sound effects, binary enhancement, right?

98
00:05:30,927 --> 00:05:33,368
Give a punch, receive a punch, this is super punch out.

99
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:42,110
which is super fun, but it's not telling you really anything other than that you gave a

100
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:46,336
punch that was satisfying, but it's not helping you really bond with the mechanics of the

101
00:05:46,336 --> 00:05:46,976
world.

102
00:05:46,976 --> 00:05:48,158
As we moved...

103
00:05:49,418 --> 00:05:52,700
further along in game design.

104
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:58,102
We have now, again, because I'm doing mostly AAA,

105
00:05:58,102 --> 00:06:02,124
kind of battle design, you have your assassination.

106
00:06:02,124 --> 00:06:03,845
So here's the strangulation.

107
00:06:03,845 --> 00:06:05,166
You have your kills from Red Dead,

108
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,587
and then again the satisfaction of killing splicers.

109
00:06:08,783 --> 00:06:12,125
satisfying in Red Dead, in particular,

110
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:16,248
the kill sounds that you hear can be so dramatic

111
00:06:16,248 --> 00:06:20,472
and so pathetic, meaning that you kind of feel

112
00:06:20,472 --> 00:06:23,654
like an asshole for killing these people,

113
00:06:23,654 --> 00:06:26,416
which contributes, again, to his psychological state.

114
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:30,039
So you are, it's an enhancement, it's deeper,

115
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:34,062
it's moving into creating emotional states for the player,

116
00:06:34,062 --> 00:06:36,463
but it is not yet.

117
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:41,781
helping the player to understand that the particular feedback that they are

118
00:06:41,781 --> 00:06:45,206
inputting into the engine is being reflected back to them.

119
00:06:45,206 --> 00:06:51,174
The way that we used to record these types of voiceover sound effects,

120
00:06:51,174 --> 00:06:53,458
we would record them as what we called a variety pack.

121
00:06:54,265 --> 00:06:57,628
So we would make diverse sounds for a single action.

122
00:06:57,628 --> 00:07:01,572
They were kind of catch-all, sort of an imprecise response.

123
00:07:01,572 --> 00:07:03,354
They're non-customizable in engine.

124
00:07:03,354 --> 00:07:06,376
You're not sure that, you know, let's say you have a bank

125
00:07:06,376 --> 00:07:12,122
of 20 sounds coming from a script like this,

126
00:07:12,122 --> 00:07:13,263
20 strangle to deaths.

127
00:07:13,263 --> 00:07:13,943
So you have,

128
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:19,197
maybe some wet ones, maybe some short ones, maybe some long ones.

129
00:07:19,197 --> 00:07:22,219
And the engine is going to randomly call them from the sound bank.

130
00:07:22,219 --> 00:07:26,342
And it's not necessarily always, some people will key it to the art, but

131
00:07:26,342 --> 00:07:30,705
that's pretty complicated from an implementation standpoint.

132
00:07:30,705 --> 00:07:33,127
It's not necessarily always going to, it's.

133
00:07:33,407 --> 00:07:35,348
Not really going to happen that much.

134
00:07:35,348 --> 00:07:38,071
It's a bank. It's going to pull from a bank.

135
00:07:38,071 --> 00:07:41,374
You're going to get whatever kind of strangulation art that you're going to get.

136
00:07:41,374 --> 00:07:44,376
You're going to get a random strangulation kind of sound that you're going to get.

137
00:07:44,376 --> 00:07:47,218
Maybe they're going to match. Maybe not.

138
00:07:47,218 --> 00:07:52,443
But it's great that we used to do it this way because we didn't want to tire the player's ear.

139
00:07:52,443 --> 00:07:57,287
So we would always say we want to do a huge batch of a lot of different things

140
00:07:57,287 --> 00:07:58,968
so that the player doesn't feel...

141
00:07:59,302 --> 00:08:02,863
tired by hearing the same punch sound all the time, the same strangulation sound all

142
00:08:02,863 --> 00:08:03,143
the time.

143
00:08:03,143 --> 00:08:11,327
And we did that mostly due to space limitations, engine limitations, processing limitations.

144
00:08:11,327 --> 00:08:18,070
So now, as we're moving forward, kind of a year or two ago, with this particular game

145
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:21,732
as an example, but with a lot of other games, you'll see

146
00:08:22,092 --> 00:08:28,334
that people are able to create what I call bespoke or custom tailored interactions.

147
00:08:28,334 --> 00:08:34,516
So we'll have something where it's not just a punch, but it's a combination of things

148
00:08:34,516 --> 00:08:39,358
that the player is putting in and then the game engine is reflecting back.

149
00:08:39,358 --> 00:08:43,679
So the player is saying, well I want to kill this guy, it's not just that I'm stabbing

150
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,820
him, it's that I'm kneeing him in the crotch and I'm hitting him with the elbow and then

151
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,841
I'm beheading him.

152
00:08:48,841 --> 00:08:50,981
Or some variety of...

153
00:08:53,596 --> 00:08:56,118
Does it sound like I like my job?

154
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:56,438
So, yeah.

155
00:08:56,438 --> 00:09:06,164
So anyway, so what we want is we want people to learn how to play the game in a way that

156
00:09:06,164 --> 00:09:11,348
is supported by the sound design that we are giving them.

157
00:09:11,668 --> 00:09:18,313
So we want to create a sound bank that is going to have a highly, highly specific, very

158
00:09:18,313 --> 00:09:24,757
small sound that is going to tag exactly to the animation that they're going to receive.

159
00:09:24,757 --> 00:09:28,100
So when you have this, let's say you're going to elbow someone in the neck.

160
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,603
It can't be what we used to do with our variety pack.

161
00:09:32,603 --> 00:09:35,306
It can't be like 10 or 20 different,

162
00:09:35,306 --> 00:09:38,248
well, maybe I'm elbowing in the neck and it's wet.

163
00:09:38,248 --> 00:09:39,869
Maybe it's dry, maybe it's raining,

164
00:09:39,869 --> 00:09:41,651
maybe it's, you know, all these different things.

165
00:09:41,651 --> 00:09:44,573
We had to figure out a way to create a really,

166
00:09:44,573 --> 00:09:47,956
really specific script that our actors could do.

167
00:09:47,956 --> 00:09:50,838
So then every one of those individual pieces

168
00:09:50,838 --> 00:09:52,820
in the engine would,

169
00:09:53,781 --> 00:09:59,207
would be consistent and would always reflect back exactly what the art was going to do.

170
00:09:59,207 --> 00:10:02,391
Again, why is this good?

171
00:10:02,391 --> 00:10:07,216
Because believe it or not, we did have to have these discussions.

172
00:10:07,216 --> 00:10:11,141
Looking at haptic feedback or looking at gyroscopic feedback as we're moving into VR.

173
00:10:13,063 --> 00:10:16,884
It's awesome, and it's great, and it gives you information,

174
00:10:16,884 --> 00:10:19,464
but it doesn't give you the kind of finely tuned information

175
00:10:19,464 --> 00:10:21,024
that I want to provide to the player

176
00:10:21,024 --> 00:10:23,665
so that the player understands exactly what they're doing

177
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:25,525
and they're learning through sound.

178
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:27,325
League, amazing.

179
00:10:27,325 --> 00:10:29,746
The art is fantastic.

180
00:10:29,746 --> 00:10:32,966
It helps you, but we could do better.

181
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,607
And that's what I'm always looking at

182
00:10:34,607 --> 00:10:35,647
is how can we do things better?

183
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,507
How can we support the player

184
00:10:37,507 --> 00:10:39,827
so that they are understanding what they're doing

185
00:10:39,827 --> 00:10:41,708
and having a more satisfying experience?

186
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:47,021
accurate, immediate reinforcing feedback between the player and the game, right?

187
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,162
You have, here's your instruction set.

188
00:10:49,162 --> 00:10:53,063
You wanna make sure that when you are giving an instruction,

189
00:10:53,063 --> 00:10:56,124
the engine is saying, yes, I understand.

190
00:10:56,124 --> 00:11:00,245
You wanna make sure that what you're gonna get back is this, not that.

191
00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:03,830
So how do we do that?

192
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:10,014
We talked about voiceover sound effects, creating audio pieces.

193
00:11:10,014 --> 00:11:14,718
A script is this kind of sample.

194
00:11:14,718 --> 00:11:17,199
And it was interesting.

195
00:11:17,199 --> 00:11:18,600
I used For Honor as an example.

196
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,602
There's a couple of other games coming up

197
00:11:20,602 --> 00:11:22,643
where we've used the same model because.

198
00:11:23,087 --> 00:11:24,828
we have so much more processing power

199
00:11:24,828 --> 00:11:27,008
and so much more customization available to us.

200
00:11:27,008 --> 00:11:32,109
The actors are really accustomed to Variety Pack

201
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:34,430
because we've been doing it for so long.

202
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:36,171
So it was really hard for them

203
00:11:36,171 --> 00:11:38,251
to kind of be reminded at every take,

204
00:11:38,251 --> 00:11:41,772
no, you have to do it the same, the same, the same,

205
00:11:41,772 --> 00:11:42,392
every time.

206
00:11:42,392 --> 00:11:45,193
And they're like, ugh, it's so, okay, I'll do it the same.

207
00:11:45,754 --> 00:11:48,536
And they would, and they would do it.

208
00:11:48,536 --> 00:11:51,618
And what was interesting, and this is a conversation for another time,

209
00:11:51,618 --> 00:11:56,182
but the Western kind of European language model,

210
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:58,864
because it's not a tone-based language,

211
00:11:58,864 --> 00:12:04,269
and it's not dependent upon absolute perfect tonal consistency every time,

212
00:12:04,269 --> 00:12:07,011
what we learned in doing this is that the actors...

213
00:12:07,303 --> 00:12:11,284
even if they're doing the same specific length for the same tiny thing,

214
00:12:11,284 --> 00:12:16,325
there will always be a tiny little micro variation in their voice.

215
00:12:16,325 --> 00:12:21,426
So it doesn't tire the ear, and when you paste everything together,

216
00:12:21,426 --> 00:12:24,627
it actually worked, which was really, really neat.

217
00:12:24,627 --> 00:12:28,288
And as we were watching players playing the game,

218
00:12:28,288 --> 00:12:31,309
they would say, like, there was one particular person I was watching,

219
00:12:31,309 --> 00:12:32,349
and they said, oh.

220
00:12:33,325 --> 00:12:33,825
That's a move.

221
00:12:33,825 --> 00:12:36,046
I'm like, yeah, that's a move.

222
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:37,627
They're like, oh, well, wait.

223
00:12:37,627 --> 00:12:40,388
And I can do, and now, and to watch them learn

224
00:12:40,388 --> 00:12:42,448
and watch them learn through sound

225
00:12:42,448 --> 00:12:44,509
was really exciting for me,

226
00:12:44,509 --> 00:12:46,910
and it made me feel as though we could give them

227
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,050
a lot more to work with

228
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:50,651
and help them understand their tools.

229
00:12:50,651 --> 00:12:52,592
So, very short talk.

230
00:12:52,592 --> 00:12:54,692
Each element is a building block.

231
00:12:54,692 --> 00:12:59,694
Enough building blocks grant you infinite customization

232
00:12:59,694 --> 00:13:00,454
by mixing them up.

233
00:13:01,168 --> 00:13:05,290
And it creates a more responsive world.

234
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:08,613
It creates a greater bond with the world,

235
00:13:08,613 --> 00:13:11,214
which is the thing that I'm always after.

236
00:13:11,214 --> 00:13:13,716
And the greater bond is greater satisfaction

237
00:13:13,716 --> 00:13:14,296
and happier players.

238
00:13:14,296 --> 00:13:15,357
That's why we do what we do.

239
00:13:15,357 --> 00:13:15,557
Yay.

240
00:13:15,557 --> 00:13:16,117
That is my talk.

241
00:13:16,117 --> 00:13:16,577
Thank you.

242
00:13:16,577 --> 00:13:16,798
Thank you.

243
00:13:16,798 --> 00:13:17,118
Thank you.

244
00:13:17,118 --> 00:13:17,278
Thank you.

245
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:17,438
Thank you.

246
00:13:17,438 --> 00:13:18,138
Thank you.

247
00:13:18,138 --> 00:13:18,479
Thank you.

248
00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:18,899
Thank you.

249
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:19,219
Thank you.

250
00:13:19,219 --> 00:13:19,419
Thank you.

251
00:13:19,419 --> 00:13:19,679
Thank you.

252
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:19,860
Thank you.

253
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,060
Thank you.

254
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:33,171
So my talk is super, super short, so if you guys want to talk about anything else, I can

255
00:13:33,171 --> 00:13:39,796
answer your questions or you can all go get coffee.

256
00:13:39,796 --> 00:13:40,656
All right.

257
00:13:40,656 --> 00:13:41,477
Coffee time.

258
00:13:41,477 --> 00:13:41,917
Oh, wait.

259
00:13:41,917 --> 00:13:43,799
You have a question.

260
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:44,779
Oh, yeah.

261
00:13:44,779 --> 00:13:48,462
Great talk.

262
00:13:48,462 --> 00:13:50,163
Perfect length.

263
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,464
Could be longer.

264
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:53,932
Then I would like to come up with two questions.

265
00:13:53,932 --> 00:13:55,394
How has this changed your casting?

266
00:13:55,394 --> 00:13:56,796
Because a lot of, are you looking at actors

267
00:13:56,796 --> 00:13:58,018
who maybe can't do a hundred,

268
00:13:58,018 --> 00:14:00,481
10 very similar variations of a hundred moves,

269
00:14:00,481 --> 00:14:02,063
or do you try to train people into it?

270
00:14:02,063 --> 00:14:04,366
Or is there a point where you're sort of like,

271
00:14:04,366 --> 00:14:05,588
okay, we have to try something different

272
00:14:05,588 --> 00:14:07,110
when we're sending out sides or auditions?

273
00:14:07,315 --> 00:14:08,456
Oh, that's a great question.

274
00:14:08,456 --> 00:14:11,320
So the question is, how has this changed my approach to casting?

275
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,803
Am I having a difficult time with people

276
00:14:13,803 --> 00:14:17,428
who are unable to conform to the kind of new?

277
00:14:17,428 --> 00:14:21,192
It could be perceived as a limitation,

278
00:14:21,192 --> 00:14:23,115
or it could be perceived as greater freedom.

279
00:14:25,314 --> 00:14:28,815
It hasn't really changed my approach to casting,

280
00:14:28,815 --> 00:14:30,916
but it has changed my approach to working

281
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:32,017
with the actors in the studio.

282
00:14:32,017 --> 00:14:35,438
It is definitely something that I need to train them into,

283
00:14:35,438 --> 00:14:39,520
and it's a little bit difficult because they are,

284
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,981
depending on, you know, some actors are trained

285
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:45,322
to do three in a row, some actors are trained to,

286
00:14:45,322 --> 00:14:45,582
for every.

287
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:48,700
one in the three in a row,

288
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,661
they're trained to give you something different.

289
00:14:50,661 --> 00:14:54,603
Some actors are like, I'll do your three in a row,

290
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:55,863
each one will be different,

291
00:14:55,863 --> 00:14:57,684
hopefully it'll be something that you like.

292
00:14:57,684 --> 00:15:00,326
Then you have other actors who are more method style actors

293
00:15:00,326 --> 00:15:02,647
and they'll say, I'll give you three in a row,

294
00:15:02,647 --> 00:15:05,268
each one is aiming for a particular level

295
00:15:05,268 --> 00:15:08,310
of emotional truth and I'm just trying to get there.

296
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:10,911
So for this item, because it is really simple,

297
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:11,411
we train them.

298
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:12,272
Fantastic, thanks.

299
00:15:12,272 --> 00:15:12,892
Yep, thanks.

300
00:15:19,274 --> 00:15:19,360
you

301
00:15:21,798 --> 00:15:24,580
Actually, continuing that question, in the VO session,

302
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:27,963
do you have strategies for getting to that point?

303
00:15:27,963 --> 00:15:31,246
Would you go through a bunch of different variations

304
00:15:31,246 --> 00:15:33,168
until you hit the thing that you want,

305
00:15:33,168 --> 00:15:34,149
and then do that 10 times?

306
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:35,109
Or how do you handle that?

307
00:15:35,109 --> 00:15:36,150
Oh, that's super smart.

308
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,151
That's a great question.

309
00:15:37,151 --> 00:15:39,653
So the question is, continuing on to that,

310
00:15:39,653 --> 00:15:41,555
when we are in the recording studio,

311
00:15:41,555 --> 00:15:44,417
if we are training someone, an actor,

312
00:15:44,417 --> 00:15:45,819
in how to do this correctly, or how

313
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:49,122
to do it in a way that gives us material that we want.

314
00:15:51,768 --> 00:15:53,709
I'm trying to think of how to phrase it.

315
00:15:53,709 --> 00:15:58,212
Do we have them try it until we get something that we like,

316
00:15:58,212 --> 00:16:01,434
and then we have them do that thing that we like 10 times?

317
00:16:01,434 --> 00:16:02,975
Or do we just kind of let them go?

318
00:16:02,975 --> 00:16:06,577
And we have them do it until we get the thing that we like,

319
00:16:06,577 --> 00:16:09,359
and then we have them do that 5 to 10 times.

320
00:16:13,133 --> 00:16:15,616
Thanks for your talk, it brings up a lot of questions.

321
00:16:15,616 --> 00:16:21,421
We've had the same issue as you, we're looking for consistency or repetition.

322
00:16:21,421 --> 00:16:25,685
So what we started doing is actually writing out onomatopoeias and a bunch of them.

323
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:31,351
So like who, and ha, and he, and same thing with case, and same thing with...

324
00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:36,433
V's or even write up silent onomatopoeias or closed mouth.

325
00:16:36,433 --> 00:16:40,694
And so we have this list that we've been using on multiple games

326
00:16:40,694 --> 00:16:42,735
with all of these written out onomatopoeias,

327
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:48,337
which makes it really easy for the actors to repeat that one specific onomatopoeia.

328
00:16:48,337 --> 00:16:52,039
And once all of that is done, then we'll go through them

329
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:54,940
and see what we recorded applies to what action

330
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:59,382
instead of being action-driven onomatopoeias.

331
00:16:59,382 --> 00:17:00,842
That's a great approach.

332
00:17:01,362 --> 00:17:07,731
So I was wondering if you had tried this and if it worked because I've constantly been wondering

333
00:17:07,731 --> 00:17:13,640
should I go more for... when I tell an actor to kick I get that same problem that you've

334
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:17,946
been getting. They do whatever and then it gets really hard to get consistent acting.

335
00:17:18,686 --> 00:17:25,688
Yeah, I think that's a fantastic approach. I haven't specifically tried that, writing out the onomatopoeias on my stuff.

336
00:17:25,688 --> 00:17:36,011
I've seen, there is a great, I don't know if he's here, there's a great sound designer at Ubisoft, who I've seen do some similar things like that.

337
00:17:36,011 --> 00:17:47,514
I think it's a fantastic approach. Restating, he is actually writing out the onomatopoeias on the script, and then gathering a library of specific sounds.

338
00:17:47,774 --> 00:17:51,977
and then seeing where they fit the art

339
00:17:51,977 --> 00:17:54,139
instead of doing it the way that we've been doing it

340
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:56,361
which is to kind of look at the art

341
00:17:56,361 --> 00:17:58,243
and then try to have the actor create something.

342
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:02,206
So he's kind of out ahead of the process.

343
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,667
I think that's super, super awesome.

344
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:05,448
It works really, really well.

345
00:18:05,448 --> 00:18:07,250
And just to add something else that I do is

346
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,533
what we do is we write all of these on a shared screen.

347
00:18:11,513 --> 00:18:15,856
So that's on our recording console computer.

348
00:18:15,856 --> 00:18:17,938
We share the screen in the vocal booth.

349
00:18:17,938 --> 00:18:19,879
So as they're doing what they're doing,

350
00:18:19,879 --> 00:18:23,822
if they do something quite different that sounds like an onomatopoeia that it can write,

351
00:18:23,822 --> 00:18:26,084
I'll add that to my list.

352
00:18:26,084 --> 00:18:28,666
So I keep track of all the written onomatopoeias.

353
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:32,368
And sometimes when they go randomly, I'll take notes of exactly how it sounds.

354
00:18:32,368 --> 00:18:33,449
It's much easier to track.

355
00:18:33,449 --> 00:18:34,930
So it's just an idea I'm throwing out.

356
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:37,852
I love this idea. It's wonderful. Yay!

357
00:18:37,852 --> 00:18:40,034
Do you guys want me to restate it, or you guys all heard it?

358
00:18:41,156 --> 00:18:42,436
Yeah, okay, great.

359
00:18:42,436 --> 00:18:44,397
Yeah, that's fabulous.

360
00:18:44,397 --> 00:18:45,677
Thank you so much.

361
00:18:45,677 --> 00:18:47,937
Hi, I'm an audio student at Cogswell

362
00:18:47,937 --> 00:18:49,437
and I actually had a question.

363
00:18:49,437 --> 00:18:52,438
What percentage of game audio requires

364
00:18:52,438 --> 00:18:53,718
the use of JavaScript?

365
00:18:53,718 --> 00:18:55,739
Because I'm learning a little bit about JavaScript

366
00:18:55,739 --> 00:18:57,859
and I was wondering if I should really pursue

367
00:18:57,859 --> 00:19:00,520
like the, you know, learning how to script,

368
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,940
you know, more advanced.

369
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,880
That is a fabulous question

370
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,501
and I wish that I knew the answer to it.

371
00:19:06,501 --> 00:19:07,261
Oh, okay.

372
00:19:07,261 --> 00:19:07,461
Um.

373
00:19:08,401 --> 00:19:09,041
I'm sorry that I don't.

374
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:11,502
The question was what percentage of game audio

375
00:19:11,502 --> 00:19:13,103
requires JavaScript?

376
00:19:13,103 --> 00:19:16,364
And is it worthwhile for a student to spend a lot of time

377
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:19,005
learning that so they can use it as a tool?

378
00:19:19,005 --> 00:19:22,686
And I'm really, really sorry, but I just

379
00:19:22,686 --> 00:19:23,527
do not know the answer.

380
00:19:23,527 --> 00:19:24,547
Thank you.

381
00:19:27,622 --> 00:19:32,945
So I'm pretty new to game audio and everything and it's especially unfamiliar with voiceover and everything

382
00:19:32,945 --> 00:19:37,907
So you're talking about getting real consistency and everything into the voiceovers

383
00:19:37,907 --> 00:19:42,649
And I would imagine like say in a fight scene for example or the fight sequence

384
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:46,451
You'd have a lot of like you get hit in the same place

385
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:51,254
But you would have a lot of variation because they're not gonna grunt the same way. So why do you want that consistency? Oh

386
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:58,002
I'd like the consistency so that, well there's always going to be, because again,

387
00:19:58,002 --> 00:20:01,824
we're not working in a tone-based language here in the production that we're doing in the U.S.

388
00:20:01,824 --> 00:20:08,747
We want that consistency, so then the player, this is a fantastic, so the question is, why do we want consistency?

389
00:20:08,747 --> 00:20:14,451
If somebody is getting kicked, why are we moving away from the concept of a variety pack?

390
00:20:14,451 --> 00:20:20,834
And the answer is, because we want it to always be the same sound.

391
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:30,237
So that little portion, it's like saying that we're going to, let's say we have a particular

392
00:20:30,237 --> 00:20:36,360
set of moves, we want the player to understand that that is the sound of a kick.

393
00:20:37,212 --> 00:20:39,995
So that is what a small kick sounds like.

394
00:20:39,995 --> 00:20:42,517
So then when the player is doing the particular input

395
00:20:42,517 --> 00:20:44,578
on the controller for a small kick,

396
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:48,041
they hear, oh, I did the controller right,

397
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:51,944
the engine understood that I wanted a small kick

398
00:20:51,944 --> 00:20:54,045
and the engine is giving me a small kick.

399
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:56,367
So it's more about the player input

400
00:20:56,367 --> 00:21:00,851
opposed to player feedback and experiencing that?

401
00:21:01,647 --> 00:21:04,169
It's so that the player understands that,

402
00:21:04,169 --> 00:21:08,673
so it's basically so that the engine is telling them,

403
00:21:08,673 --> 00:21:10,954
I received your command correctly.

404
00:21:10,954 --> 00:21:13,316
It's basically just an echo back.

405
00:21:13,316 --> 00:21:16,118
And in order to, if it was,

406
00:21:16,118 --> 00:21:17,559
if we were still working in binary,

407
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:19,220
like if we were doing super punch out,

408
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,622
and it was the same thing all the time,

409
00:21:21,622 --> 00:21:23,844
like, oh my God, it would be super boring and sucky.

410
00:21:24,405 --> 00:21:30,332
This only works when you are working in sort of a for-honor environment or an

411
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:34,517
upcoming environment where you're creating or stitching together bespoke

412
00:21:34,517 --> 00:21:40,284
things. It would not be awesome if you were working in Super Punch-Out because

413
00:21:40,284 --> 00:21:43,048
it would be super boring. Thank you.

414
00:21:46,727 --> 00:21:47,868
Hi, thanks for your talk.

415
00:21:47,868 --> 00:21:51,310
So it sounds like you're talking about shorter asset length?

416
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,011
Correct.

417
00:21:52,011 --> 00:21:53,612
Yeah, absolutely.

418
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:55,774
That flow together and sort of fight combos?

419
00:21:55,774 --> 00:21:56,094
Exactly.

420
00:21:56,094 --> 00:21:57,875
Not a button masher kind of a situation.

421
00:21:57,875 --> 00:21:59,336
But how do you feel that that changes,

422
00:21:59,336 --> 00:22:02,919
like if something needs to get changed

423
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:05,700
in terms of an animation, like the timing

424
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,502
needs to get changed or something,

425
00:22:07,502 --> 00:22:12,025
do you feel like that makes it easier

426
00:22:12,025 --> 00:22:13,786
to kind of roll with those kinds of changes?

427
00:22:13,786 --> 00:22:14,346
Or is it?

428
00:22:14,888 --> 00:22:16,350
That's a great question.

429
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:19,374
The question is, what happens after you record all of these

430
00:22:19,374 --> 00:22:21,756
teeny tiny sounds that are going to be pieced together

431
00:22:21,756 --> 00:22:24,319
and make your little Lego dragon or your Lego Millennium

432
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:28,684
Falcon or whatever, and the animation changes?

433
00:22:29,947 --> 00:22:33,271
I don't know that it necessarily makes it easier or harder.

434
00:22:33,271 --> 00:22:36,594
I don't think that those things,

435
00:22:36,594 --> 00:22:39,998
I think you probably are faced with a re-record.

436
00:22:39,998 --> 00:22:40,438
Okay.

437
00:22:40,438 --> 00:22:42,140
Which sucks, but that's.

438
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:42,420
Sure.

439
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,583
If you wanna do it right, yeah.

440
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:44,963
Okay.

441
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:45,624
It's a good question.

442
00:22:45,624 --> 00:22:45,864
Thank you.

443
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:46,024
Thanks.

444
00:22:46,024 --> 00:22:46,084
Hi.

445
00:22:46,084 --> 00:22:46,124
Hi.

446
00:22:46,124 --> 00:22:49,888
So one of the things I really appreciate

447
00:22:49,888 --> 00:22:52,771
about what you're talking about is

448
00:22:53,763 --> 00:22:56,004
the implicit accessibility advantages.

449
00:22:56,004 --> 00:23:00,988
Anytime that what the player does

450
00:23:00,988 --> 00:23:04,170
corresponds uniquely to what they hear

451
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:08,813
has inherent advantages for any blind or low vision gamers

452
00:23:08,813 --> 00:23:12,715
who otherwise aren't getting that reinforcement

453
00:23:12,715 --> 00:23:13,996
from what they're playing.

454
00:23:13,996 --> 00:23:16,298
So, a little bit of icing on the cake.

455
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,582
That is amazing, thank you very much.

456
00:23:18,582 --> 00:23:21,586
The comment is that this really helps accessibility

457
00:23:21,586 --> 00:23:24,689
for low vision people or people who are blind

458
00:23:24,689 --> 00:23:25,671
who are playing the game.

459
00:23:25,671 --> 00:23:27,373
That, I hadn't even thought of that

460
00:23:27,373 --> 00:23:28,794
and that is an incredible thing to say.

461
00:23:28,794 --> 00:23:29,976
Thank you. It's a really good thing.

462
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:40,627
Hi, so I was kind of thinking, I did see that the direction that you had for some actors was, you know, like,

463
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:47,532
we're going to do the same sound with variants 10 times, but also at the same time with consistency.

464
00:23:47,532 --> 00:23:55,858
With the advent of middleware now, you know, like really running inside games in particular,

465
00:23:55,858 --> 00:23:58,539
you know, like, especially at the AAA level.

466
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:02,164
how often is it, because I'm sure that, you know,

467
00:24:02,164 --> 00:24:05,748
like not all 10 assets are going to be used.

468
00:24:05,748 --> 00:24:07,530
So how often is it that, you know, like,

469
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:10,074
you would put like a randomizer in terms of like pitch

470
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:13,117
and volume to substitute out and kind of get rid

471
00:24:13,117 --> 00:24:13,898
of that monotony?

472
00:24:15,866 --> 00:24:19,028
Well, I think that for this particular, it's a good question.

473
00:24:19,028 --> 00:24:25,210
So the question is, if I'm understanding it correctly, would we then use middleware in

474
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:27,811
order to try to create variance?

475
00:24:27,811 --> 00:24:33,934
Is that in order to create variance to avoid sort of audio monotony in the particular sound?

476
00:24:33,934 --> 00:24:40,117
For this specific practice, I don't think that we would.

477
00:24:40,977 --> 00:24:46,701
Because we rely on the actor's natural kind of organic,

478
00:24:46,701 --> 00:24:50,044
tiny variation in order to do it.

479
00:24:50,044 --> 00:24:52,285
So yeah, I'm not sure that we would.

480
00:24:52,285 --> 00:24:55,067
Some other people might, and it might be amazing.

481
00:24:55,067 --> 00:24:56,688
For us in practice, we haven't done that.

482
00:24:56,688 --> 00:24:57,509
But it's a good question.

483
00:24:57,509 --> 00:24:57,909
Thank you.

484
00:24:57,909 --> 00:24:58,029
Great.

485
00:24:58,029 --> 00:24:58,670
Thank you so much.

486
00:24:58,670 --> 00:24:59,210
Hey, thanks a lot.

487
00:25:02,962 --> 00:25:08,848
So the question I have is does this approach change at all for working with creatures or

488
00:25:08,848 --> 00:25:12,151
more monster type and less humanoid creatures?

489
00:25:12,151 --> 00:25:15,534
Wow that's a fantastic question.

490
00:25:15,534 --> 00:25:16,875
Gosh I don't know.

491
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:20,238
I guess it would depend on if you were playing the creature.

492
00:25:20,238 --> 00:25:26,464
I think if you were playing the creature as like some sort of giant thing that would have

493
00:25:26,464 --> 00:25:28,486
multiple moves that would be stitched together.

494
00:25:28,842 --> 00:25:31,345
where it would be, where the player would need

495
00:25:31,345 --> 00:25:34,088
to understand what the direction they've given

496
00:25:34,088 --> 00:25:35,169
to the creature.

497
00:25:35,169 --> 00:25:38,213
I think if it's a playable creature character,

498
00:25:38,213 --> 00:25:40,656
God, that would be fun.

499
00:25:40,656 --> 00:25:45,341
So, yeah, that's a big, pardon?

500
00:25:46,041 --> 00:25:47,624
It was a devious laugh.

501
00:25:47,624 --> 00:25:49,947
Yeah, that is a great question.

502
00:25:49,947 --> 00:25:51,089
I think if it's playable, sure.

503
00:25:51,089 --> 00:25:51,209
Cool.

504
00:25:51,209 --> 00:25:54,514
And I did get the five minute thing,

505
00:25:54,514 --> 00:25:58,501
so thank you very, very much everyone.

506
00:25:58,501 --> 00:25:59,462
I really appreciate your time.
