1
00:00:16,405 --> 00:00:17,105
Welcome everybody.

2
00:00:22,068 --> 00:00:22,648
All right.

3
00:00:23,468 --> 00:00:26,930
So today we're going to talk about game studio management.

4
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:29,311
This is my 20th GDC.

5
00:00:29,331 --> 00:00:31,252
Yeah.

6
00:00:33,213 --> 00:00:36,615
And what better way to celebrate than talking about game studio management.

7
00:00:37,766 --> 00:00:42,270
OK, so for people who don't know about my situation,

8
00:00:43,231 --> 00:00:44,812
I've worked at a lot of places over the years.

9
00:00:44,912 --> 00:00:46,293
One place I got a lot of education

10
00:00:46,353 --> 00:00:48,895
about studio management was at Disney Imagineering,

11
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:51,377
where I was the creative director of the Disney Virtual

12
00:00:51,417 --> 00:00:52,278
Reality Studio.

13
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,620
Also for the last 12 years or so,

14
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,382
I have taught at the Entertainment Technology Center

15
00:00:57,562 --> 00:01:00,265
at Carnegie Mellon University, where at this point,

16
00:01:00,305 --> 00:01:03,507
I guess I've helped oversee hundreds of different teams

17
00:01:04,268 --> 00:01:05,429
make various game projects.

18
00:01:06,684 --> 00:01:08,965
And also, for the last 12 years, I've run my own studio,

19
00:01:09,025 --> 00:01:12,367
Shell Games, which is in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

20
00:01:12,408 --> 00:01:14,469
We started out with about five people.

21
00:01:14,969 --> 00:01:17,591
And over the years, we have gradually grown up to our

22
00:01:17,671 --> 00:01:19,292
current staff of 100 people.

23
00:01:20,693 --> 00:01:23,035
And so part of what I'll be able to talk about today is

24
00:01:23,175 --> 00:01:24,576
some of those transitions and some of the

25
00:01:24,596 --> 00:01:25,296
things you run into.

26
00:01:26,277 --> 00:01:31,421
So first, I would like to ask, who here is really excited

27
00:01:32,121 --> 00:01:32,882
about management?

28
00:01:32,922 --> 00:01:33,362
Raise your hand.

29
00:01:34,667 --> 00:01:35,287
Raise your hand.

30
00:01:35,988 --> 00:01:38,191
All right, I see a lot of ironic hand raises there.

31
00:01:39,112 --> 00:01:42,576
And then I see a lot of, yeah, and there's no way, no.

32
00:01:43,638 --> 00:01:45,720
And I guess I have to wonder, like, really,

33
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,882
did you see what was on the door?

34
00:01:47,122 --> 00:01:50,326
I mean, it's a management talk all up in here.

35
00:01:51,147 --> 00:01:53,109
Because one of the things we find in the game industry,

36
00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:54,551
let me ask this question, who here is excited

37
00:01:54,571 --> 00:01:55,552
about making great games?

38
00:01:55,753 --> 00:01:56,213
Raise your hand.

39
00:01:56,273 --> 00:01:57,715
Yeah, there's all the hands, right?

40
00:01:58,216 --> 00:02:01,099
And that is the thing in the game industry.

41
00:02:01,139 --> 00:02:04,343
People are not super excited about management all the time.

42
00:02:04,403 --> 00:02:04,984
Some people are.

43
00:02:06,145 --> 00:02:09,307
But everybody's excited about making great games.

44
00:02:09,848 --> 00:02:11,309
But the management still needs to get done.

45
00:02:11,869 --> 00:02:15,351
And so a lot of it is bad, as we know, because people just

46
00:02:15,491 --> 00:02:17,012
aren't that into it.

47
00:02:17,312 --> 00:02:19,854
Because most of us, when it comes to management, we're

48
00:02:19,894 --> 00:02:21,415
kind of this guy right here.

49
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:25,778
I'd much rather be focusing on my games and not having to

50
00:02:25,798 --> 00:02:27,138
deal with all this management BS.

51
00:02:27,979 --> 00:02:29,840
And this often leads to a lot of problems.

52
00:02:30,769 --> 00:02:34,651
So some of the common problems that you get from bad management, right?

53
00:02:35,432 --> 00:02:38,454
You're in a situation, you're like, I don't know how to structure management because,

54
00:02:38,514 --> 00:02:40,636
hey, I didn't, I don't have an MBA, what do I know about this?

55
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:43,858
I don't know how things should be structured, particularly as your studio is growing.

56
00:02:44,578 --> 00:02:48,021
I've got this one project, I'm not sure what's the right way, what is the best and optimal

57
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:49,782
way to manage this given project?

58
00:02:50,943 --> 00:02:53,965
Oh my God, we had another miscommunication with a client.

59
00:02:54,065 --> 00:02:58,268
You know, we thought they understood what we meant when we said we were cutting the

60
00:02:58,328 --> 00:03:00,410
combat, but no, they didn't understand.

61
00:03:01,444 --> 00:03:02,044
So you've got that.

62
00:03:02,205 --> 00:03:05,326
And then tell me if you've ever had this problem.

63
00:03:05,526 --> 00:03:06,967
Too many meetings, right?

64
00:03:07,247 --> 00:03:09,028
I don't think I've ever been anywhere where people haven't

65
00:03:09,048 --> 00:03:11,090
said, oh my god, you just have too many meetings.

66
00:03:12,831 --> 00:03:13,691
Low morale.

67
00:03:14,151 --> 00:03:14,972
It's embarrassing.

68
00:03:15,012 --> 00:03:16,033
It happens sometimes.

69
00:03:16,133 --> 00:03:18,614
And you went into games because you wanted to be awesome.

70
00:03:18,714 --> 00:03:21,236
And then if you're going to work every day and it's not

71
00:03:21,336 --> 00:03:23,877
awesome, then that is not awesome.

72
00:03:24,818 --> 00:03:26,639
Now the next one, I'm sure, has never happened to anyone

73
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:27,199
in this room.

74
00:03:28,717 --> 00:03:29,317
Late games.

75
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:32,579
Late games are not an accident or, you know,

76
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,380
you can't just blame it on the creative process.

77
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,020
Late games is bad management.

78
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:36,921
That is what that is.

79
00:03:37,581 --> 00:03:39,102
And then the last one, the worst one,

80
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:43,343
the one that we never talk about at GDC, our game sucks.

81
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,004
Oh, man.

82
00:03:45,104 --> 00:03:45,644
Damn it.

83
00:03:45,744 --> 00:03:48,085
We worked on this a year and a half, and it sucks.

84
00:03:48,746 --> 00:03:48,946
Right?

85
00:03:49,426 --> 00:03:51,487
So those are things that happen all the time.

86
00:03:51,587 --> 00:03:52,467
They happen to everybody.

87
00:03:53,754 --> 00:03:58,717
And the key is finding a way to fix these things.

88
00:03:58,797 --> 00:04:01,038
OK, so when I was trying to understand this stuff,

89
00:04:01,138 --> 00:04:04,961
because I don't come from a place where I'm like,

90
00:04:05,781 --> 00:04:07,842
had some super amazing management education

91
00:04:07,882 --> 00:04:11,644
or anything, particularly as my studio started to grow,

92
00:04:11,685 --> 00:04:12,765
it's like, man, what are we going to do?

93
00:04:13,546 --> 00:04:15,807
And thinking kind of broadly about it,

94
00:04:15,907 --> 00:04:18,929
I couldn't help but think about ants and bees.

95
00:04:20,189 --> 00:04:21,290
Because, you know, ants and bees.

96
00:04:22,326 --> 00:04:23,927
get a lot done.

97
00:04:24,887 --> 00:04:27,269
Oh my god, they get all this stuff done.

98
00:04:27,769 --> 00:04:28,530
Like, look at this.

99
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,730
The bees built that.

100
00:04:31,111 --> 00:04:32,952
They got together and said, yeah, we're going to build this.

101
00:04:33,512 --> 00:04:34,073
And they did it.

102
00:04:34,353 --> 00:04:35,494
Look how perfect it is.

103
00:04:36,314 --> 00:04:38,755
There's no design document.

104
00:04:39,536 --> 00:04:41,217
There's no daily scrum.

105
00:04:42,137 --> 00:04:44,018
There's no deadlines.

106
00:04:44,579 --> 00:04:46,300
They just like, no, we're just going to get together.

107
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,021
We're all going to do this, and it's going to be awesome.

108
00:04:48,854 --> 00:04:52,677
So how is that possible? And check this one out. Here's this guy. He's really into ants.

109
00:04:53,538 --> 00:04:58,563
So he finds abandoned anthills and he gets a big five-gallon drum of dental plaster and

110
00:04:58,603 --> 00:05:03,828
he pours it down slowly, slowly into the anthill, waits for it to harden, and then slowly, carefully

111
00:05:03,868 --> 00:05:10,555
digs it out and hangs it up. And that's the interior of an anthill. Those little spirally

112
00:05:10,595 --> 00:05:11,496
things are tunnels.

113
00:05:12,417 --> 00:05:14,818
going down, sort of corkscrew tunnels that the ants make,

114
00:05:15,119 --> 00:05:18,862
and those little flat leaves hanging off are rooms that the ants have created.

115
00:05:19,142 --> 00:05:22,765
Most of the lower rooms are kitchens where food is prepared

116
00:05:23,385 --> 00:05:27,008
for the rest of the colony. And they do all this with no meetings.

117
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:32,392
So I want to understand how is that possible, because I'd like to live in a

118
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:33,053
world with no

119
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:33,993
meetings. What's going on?

120
00:05:35,223 --> 00:05:37,103
So then I read this book, The Superorganism,

121
00:05:37,643 --> 00:05:39,504
by a couple of guys who really studied the heck out

122
00:05:39,524 --> 00:05:40,504
of insect societies.

123
00:05:41,484 --> 00:05:43,164
And they explain a lot of it.

124
00:05:43,284 --> 00:05:44,905
And one of the key quotes I liked

125
00:05:44,925 --> 00:05:45,945
was actually from another book.

126
00:05:46,545 --> 00:05:48,345
The formation of a higher level unit

127
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,486
by integrating lower level units will

128
00:05:50,506 --> 00:05:53,986
succeed only if the emerging organization acquires

129
00:05:54,046 --> 00:05:57,707
the appropriate technologies for passing information

130
00:05:57,867 --> 00:05:58,667
among its members.

131
00:05:59,367 --> 00:06:02,028
And I think the key phrase there is passing information.

132
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,121
It's really weird to think about ants and bees having

133
00:06:05,221 --> 00:06:06,521
information technologies.

134
00:06:07,322 --> 00:06:08,882
But that's exactly what they have.

135
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,903
They have systems of communicating with each other

136
00:06:12,424 --> 00:06:16,145
in evolved, organized ways so that the right information

137
00:06:16,405 --> 00:06:19,246
gets to the right insects at the right time so that they

138
00:06:19,286 --> 00:06:22,047
all know what to do for the good of the whole

139
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:22,828
organization.

140
00:06:24,068 --> 00:06:24,788
So it's very efficient.

141
00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:26,309
OK, so I got thinking about that.

142
00:06:26,549 --> 00:06:27,229
Man, that's cool.

143
00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:30,291
They sort of do have meetings, but they're just really,

144
00:06:30,331 --> 00:06:30,851
really efficient.

145
00:06:30,871 --> 00:06:32,011
They're so efficient, you don't even notice

146
00:06:32,031 --> 00:06:32,512
they're having them.

147
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:37,092
So thinking about that, then thinking about other things, about this notion of information.

148
00:06:38,132 --> 00:06:41,455
A lot of philosophers have been talking about information lately.

149
00:06:41,675 --> 00:06:44,837
We used to talk, you know, philosophers used to talk about the universe made of matter

150
00:06:45,398 --> 00:06:46,018
and the elements.

151
00:06:46,118 --> 00:06:49,120
And then they started saying, no, the universe is really made of energy.

152
00:06:49,601 --> 00:06:54,564
And now the modern thing is, actually, the universe may be made entirely of information

153
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:55,805
and nothing else.

154
00:06:56,506 --> 00:06:57,727
And that's an interesting idea.

155
00:06:58,727 --> 00:07:03,751
and then i got to thinking about kind of eastern medicine and body meridians and

156
00:07:03,871 --> 00:07:04,472
acupuncture

157
00:07:05,112 --> 00:07:07,855
and when you talk to western doctors about it a lot of time they say well

158
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:11,858
that doesn't really exist she energy flowing around the body you'd show me

159
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:14,521
it's not there you can see it it doesn't exist it's not there

160
00:07:14,881 --> 00:07:16,122
this is a placebo effect

161
00:07:16,563 --> 00:07:17,664
but anyone who's

162
00:07:18,084 --> 00:07:20,606
had a massage or meditates or

163
00:07:20,626 --> 00:07:23,609
uh... or has undergone acupuncture does tai chi

164
00:07:24,227 --> 00:07:24,707
uh... has

165
00:07:25,187 --> 00:07:25,968
experience

166
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:28,008
this energy flow

167
00:07:28,969 --> 00:07:30,029
and i've often wondered if

168
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:34,111
well okay maybe she isn't like electrical energy or

169
00:07:34,552 --> 00:07:36,913
or something or some mystical force flowing around

170
00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:40,413
What if it is a kind of information traveling in the body?

171
00:07:40,453 --> 00:07:44,678
Because we know that our body is a big information network.

172
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:47,642
It would be like if I said, hey, here's the internet.

173
00:07:48,042 --> 00:07:49,043
There are viruses on it.

174
00:07:49,164 --> 00:07:51,687
Point them out as you look at the physical network.

175
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:53,929
You might conclude that, no, they don't exist

176
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,511
because they're invisible.

177
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:02,966
And Christopher Alexander, one of the greatest geniuses of our time.

178
00:08:03,967 --> 00:08:05,889
That's another talk for another day.

179
00:08:06,829 --> 00:08:09,993
In his books, he talks about space being defined by channels of energy.

180
00:08:10,013 --> 00:08:10,713
And I think we've all...

181
00:08:11,211 --> 00:08:14,992
experience this. You know, as you move through cities, there are certain channels where there's

182
00:08:15,032 --> 00:08:19,893
good energy and bad energy, and even in your living room, there's the spots where everybody

183
00:08:19,993 --> 00:08:23,154
kind of moves through, and then there's that dead corner that everything's kind of weird,

184
00:08:23,454 --> 00:08:26,735
and you realize, I should move the couch, and that's why, because that corner feels

185
00:08:26,775 --> 00:08:33,657
weird and bad. So you have that kind of, that may be a kind of information flow. And in

186
00:08:33,697 --> 00:08:36,018
our studios, there's everybody working away.

187
00:08:37,472 --> 00:08:39,413
And you can see people working, and you can look at their

188
00:08:39,473 --> 00:08:40,794
emails, and you can see that stuff.

189
00:08:40,814 --> 00:08:44,017
But the thing that you can't see is the relationships

190
00:08:44,097 --> 00:08:44,777
between people.

191
00:08:44,817 --> 00:08:48,540
And the relationships end up defining an awful lot of how

192
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,741
things happen at the company.

193
00:08:50,081 --> 00:08:54,185
But they are invisible, unless Google comes out with some new

194
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:55,966
app that lets you see that.

195
00:08:56,026 --> 00:08:58,648
But we can't see that just yet.

196
00:08:58,728 --> 00:09:00,109
Oh my god, that's why Facebook bought

197
00:09:00,209 --> 00:09:01,370
Oculus, I just realized.

198
00:09:02,657 --> 00:09:09,263
Anyway, so as Saint-Exupéry said in The Little Prince,

199
00:09:09,744 --> 00:09:12,286
what is essential is invisible to the eye.

200
00:09:12,827 --> 00:09:15,009
And so just because these things are invisible

201
00:09:15,049 --> 00:09:16,370
doesn't mean we shouldn't focus on them.

202
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:18,632
And in fact, maybe it means we should focus on them

203
00:09:19,173 --> 00:09:19,653
all the more.

204
00:09:20,963 --> 00:09:25,206
A book that was very influential on me is this book, Design Yourself, by Kareem Rashid.

205
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:29,769
It has a lot of really kooky advice in it, but the spirit of the book is what influenced

206
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:30,390
me the most.

207
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:36,574
His fundamental idea is that you should design your life so that you like it.

208
00:09:36,954 --> 00:09:38,836
You shouldn't just live your life or just deal with things.

209
00:09:38,876 --> 00:09:42,158
You should look at the things you don't like and say, okay, you know what?

210
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:43,960
This is a design problem.

211
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:47,462
I'm going to design this so that I like it.

212
00:09:48,102 --> 00:09:51,463
And when it comes to how to get studio management going,

213
00:09:51,843 --> 00:09:55,083
if you don't like the information flows in your studio,

214
00:09:55,524 --> 00:09:57,944
you need to design them so that they are good.

215
00:09:58,444 --> 00:09:59,804
But in order to do that, you need to know

216
00:09:59,864 --> 00:10:02,045
what is the information in your studio.

217
00:10:02,585 --> 00:10:04,965
And that's a little tricky, because, again, it's invisible,

218
00:10:05,485 --> 00:10:07,546
and we don't always see it.

219
00:10:08,466 --> 00:10:10,986
So let's meditate for a second on the notion of information.

220
00:10:11,606 --> 00:10:12,346
Can we get the sound up?

221
00:10:14,087 --> 00:10:14,267
Yeah.

222
00:10:15,347 --> 00:10:16,447
All right, maybe we'll get some of that.

223
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,083
By hook or by crook, we will.

224
00:10:22,543 --> 00:10:24,305
Right, so getting information is difficult.

225
00:10:24,365 --> 00:10:26,827
And it may take a lot of hooks and a lot of crooks

226
00:10:27,688 --> 00:10:29,229
in order to get it out of a studio.

227
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:30,851
So at first, it seems kind of daunting.

228
00:10:30,911 --> 00:10:32,552
Like, let me look at all the information that's

229
00:10:32,592 --> 00:10:34,554
flowing around in my studio.

230
00:10:36,356 --> 00:10:39,598
So I tried to come up with simple things,

231
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:40,399
and I couldn't do it.

232
00:10:40,419 --> 00:10:41,680
I was taking this top-down approach

233
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,782
of trying to dissect information in the studio

234
00:10:44,483 --> 00:10:45,304
and was kind of failing.

235
00:10:45,324 --> 00:10:46,525
And so I sat down with Chuck Hoover.

236
00:10:47,561 --> 00:10:49,463
And we started making a big list of like, well,

237
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,605
let's talk about all the many, many kinds of information

238
00:10:52,126 --> 00:10:53,367
that are in the studio.

239
00:10:53,748 --> 00:10:54,969
We just made this big, crazy list

240
00:10:54,989 --> 00:10:56,150
with hundreds and hundreds of elements.

241
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:57,031
And here's some samples.

242
00:10:57,732 --> 00:10:59,013
We took a very bottom-up approach.

243
00:10:59,434 --> 00:11:01,436
You know, hey, there's a change to this project.

244
00:11:01,476 --> 00:11:02,457
Hey, there's a new project.

245
00:11:02,797 --> 00:11:04,399
Hey, we got a new studio policy.

246
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,642
Hey, there's a best practice for the right way

247
00:11:06,662 --> 00:11:07,703
to do C-sharp coding.

248
00:11:08,323 --> 00:11:09,963
We're having a birthday party on Friday.

249
00:11:10,764 --> 00:11:12,064
Hey, the project's in a little trouble.

250
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:13,545
Hey, I'm really uneasy.

251
00:11:13,785 --> 00:11:15,125
Oh, I'm super confident about this.

252
00:11:15,385 --> 00:11:18,986
I'd like to throw a red flag on the way that we're documenting everything.

253
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:20,047
I need help.

254
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:24,648
That Benson guy, I don't trust that guy at all.

255
00:11:25,328 --> 00:11:28,009
Hey, clients, we got something to tell you.

256
00:11:28,669 --> 00:11:29,930
Wait, no, who's good at what?

257
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,930
Are you good at this and are you good at that?

258
00:11:32,511 --> 00:11:33,091
I'm blocked.

259
00:11:33,111 --> 00:11:34,951
I can't, I've got nothing to do.

260
00:11:35,031 --> 00:11:35,832
Hey, I've got an idea.

261
00:11:36,012 --> 00:11:37,312
Hey, we're out of paper towels.

262
00:11:37,952 --> 00:11:39,353
That Benson guy, he's an idiot.

263
00:11:39,473 --> 00:11:40,174
Oh my god.

264
00:11:40,914 --> 00:11:41,134
Right?

265
00:11:41,515 --> 00:11:41,755
All right.

266
00:11:42,315 --> 00:11:44,717
The studio mission is this.

267
00:11:45,158 --> 00:11:46,119
I'm from Idaho.

268
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,741
This information that I'm telling you

269
00:11:48,781 --> 00:11:50,022
is very, very secret.

270
00:11:50,462 --> 00:11:52,644
I'm really upset right now.

271
00:11:53,405 --> 00:11:55,567
I'm about to start coding this module right now.

272
00:11:55,927 --> 00:11:58,609
Anyway, so there's all these kinds of information.

273
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:02,332
And it seems sort of overwhelming when you're like,

274
00:12:02,593 --> 00:12:03,653
yeah, this is all flowing around.

275
00:12:03,673 --> 00:12:04,454
What am I going to do?

276
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:09,947
with this. So looking at it and kind of shaking it around, we started to come up with categories

277
00:12:09,967 --> 00:12:14,750
and I realized that there were some simple categories of information. One of them is

278
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:20,032
sort of obvious, facts. Duh. A lot of information is facts. Okay, everybody knows that. And

279
00:12:20,052 --> 00:12:24,494
then other information is opinions. Sure, okay, we know that. There are facts and there

280
00:12:24,514 --> 00:12:29,176
are opinions. Okay, that's an information hierarchy right there. But then there's something

281
00:12:29,236 --> 00:12:34,418
else. Emotions. Now some people would say, no, no, no, those are just opinions.

282
00:12:34,992 --> 00:12:36,893
And I said, no, they're not, right?

283
00:12:37,393 --> 00:12:37,894
They are not.

284
00:12:38,254 --> 00:12:39,175
I am mad at you.

285
00:12:39,255 --> 00:12:40,015
That is not opinion.

286
00:12:40,175 --> 00:12:42,337
That is a stone cold fact, right?

287
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,519
So weirdly, emotions are actually more facts

288
00:12:45,539 --> 00:12:46,300
than they are opinions.

289
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,321
But they're not like pure objective facts.

290
00:12:48,341 --> 00:12:50,442
They're very personal kind of facts.

291
00:12:50,863 --> 00:12:53,945
So I find it a good idea to separate those out,

292
00:12:54,025 --> 00:12:55,466
because emotions travel differently

293
00:12:55,506 --> 00:12:56,427
than normal facts do.

294
00:12:57,087 --> 00:12:58,908
So those are three kinds of information, facts, opinions,

295
00:12:58,968 --> 00:12:59,509
and emotions.

296
00:13:00,149 --> 00:13:01,230
And they are about things.

297
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:04,512
And what are they about when you're in a game studio?

298
00:13:04,552 --> 00:13:06,253
Well, a lot of times they're about projects.

299
00:13:06,713 --> 00:13:08,014
It's like, hey, we're working on this project,

300
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:10,674
and I have facts, opinions, and emotions about that project.

301
00:13:11,275 --> 00:13:13,515
Separate from that, they're about processes.

302
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:15,816
Processes outlive projects sometimes.

303
00:13:15,856 --> 00:13:17,617
Sometimes they live within a project.

304
00:13:17,637 --> 00:13:19,978
But processes are really kind of separate from projects,

305
00:13:20,018 --> 00:13:21,458
the way you do things, how you do things.

306
00:13:22,098 --> 00:13:23,259
And then the third one is people,

307
00:13:24,579 --> 00:13:26,200
because people are doing these projects.

308
00:13:26,841 --> 00:13:28,043
OK, well that's a thing.

309
00:13:28,103 --> 00:13:29,084
Maybe you can break that out.

310
00:13:29,384 --> 00:13:31,567
You have facts, opinions, and emotions about projects,

311
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:32,609
processes, and people.

312
00:13:33,443 --> 00:13:34,404
Well, OK, that's something.

313
00:13:34,684 --> 00:13:35,664
Does that cover everything?

314
00:13:36,145 --> 00:13:36,445
I don't know.

315
00:13:36,485 --> 00:13:37,245
It's not perfect.

316
00:13:37,585 --> 00:13:40,266
But going back to the spreadsheet and going back to

317
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:43,548
the big thing, kind of made the six columns, and started to

318
00:13:43,588 --> 00:13:44,348
kind of check it off.

319
00:13:44,388 --> 00:13:48,970
And it's like, yeah, new studio policy, that's a fact

320
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:49,911
about a process.

321
00:13:50,911 --> 00:13:52,112
Well, hey, I need help.

322
00:13:52,192 --> 00:13:53,992
That's an opinion about a project.

323
00:13:54,113 --> 00:13:55,773
And I'm blocked.

324
00:13:55,853 --> 00:13:56,954
That's a fact.

325
00:13:57,434 --> 00:14:00,956
And it's about a project, and probably about a process, too.

326
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,794
And we found, like, yeah, this seems to cover things.

327
00:14:04,894 --> 00:14:05,856
So that's kind of cool.

328
00:14:05,896 --> 00:14:06,858
That's kind of interesting.

329
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,625
OK, well, so that's a way to break down information.

330
00:14:10,925 --> 00:14:13,951
Now we need to look at, like, where does that information go?

331
00:14:13,971 --> 00:14:15,274
Because information is not static.

332
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:20,001
The first thing to think about is the fact that we ourselves are information networks.

333
00:14:20,782 --> 00:14:22,842
We are not just like a point on a graph.

334
00:14:23,122 --> 00:14:26,984
We are a complex information network inside ourselves and inside our minds.

335
00:14:27,444 --> 00:14:30,485
And if you've ever tried to think of a name and you can't think of it, and then two minutes

336
00:14:30,505 --> 00:14:34,467
later you thought of it, like, yeah, that's because the information was in there the whole

337
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:34,807
time.

338
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:36,548
It just had a little trouble.

339
00:14:36,848 --> 00:14:39,289
It got caught in a router somewhere and could not find its way.

340
00:14:40,449 --> 00:14:42,130
So first, we are information networks.

341
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,111
But then, of course, it's hierarchical

342
00:14:44,171 --> 00:14:46,432
because you connect up with other people in the studio.

343
00:14:46,492 --> 00:14:48,173
So there's internal information flow

344
00:14:48,273 --> 00:14:49,773
and then there's external information flow.

345
00:14:50,253 --> 00:14:51,794
And then it's hierarchical again

346
00:14:52,714 --> 00:14:54,855
because the studio communicates with other entities.

347
00:14:55,215 --> 00:14:56,856
Maybe a publisher, maybe with your players,

348
00:14:56,876 --> 00:14:58,857
maybe you've got a licensor or the press

349
00:14:59,037 --> 00:15:00,838
or outsource partners or all kinds of other things.

350
00:15:00,878 --> 00:15:03,519
So you have these sort of hierarchies of information flow.

351
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:05,399
All right, so that's useful to think about.

352
00:15:06,391 --> 00:15:09,834
But now, the way all information flows is not created equal.

353
00:15:12,015 --> 00:15:14,437
In the business world, we tend to use four main ways

354
00:15:15,097 --> 00:15:16,218
of communication.

355
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:18,560
Face-to-face, we do a lot.

356
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,162
More and more, we're doing Skype, sort of video conference,

357
00:15:21,942 --> 00:15:24,384
phone calls sometimes, and then lots and lots of email.

358
00:15:26,106 --> 00:15:28,647
And as much as some people like to believe that all these are

359
00:15:28,687 --> 00:15:30,529
equivalent, they certainly are not.

360
00:15:30,569 --> 00:15:32,710
We have lots of evidence that they are not.

361
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,932
And it's interesting to wonder about why.

362
00:15:35,321 --> 00:15:39,625
The key seems to be that the things at the top you're getting much more

363
00:15:39,725 --> 00:15:42,888
information and the things at the bottom you're getting much less.

364
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:48,453
Face to face communication is a lot of information because yes, you are

365
00:15:48,473 --> 00:15:51,856
hearing my words, but you're also hearing my tone of voice.

366
00:15:52,156 --> 00:15:56,160
You're seeing my facial expression, but then it gets even weirder and deeper

367
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,643
than that because that's all with your conscious mind.

368
00:15:59,966 --> 00:16:03,569
Your subconscious mind is very good at communicating with other people face to face.

369
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:07,412
There's well documented notion of micro expressions.

370
00:16:07,953 --> 00:16:12,036
Micro expressions are generally when there's a conflict within you, you want to communicate

371
00:16:12,116 --> 00:16:14,218
one thing but you want to hide your emotions.

372
00:16:14,539 --> 00:16:15,820
You can't hide them perfectly.

373
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,181
And so there is a period.

374
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:22,804
of about 40 milliseconds where you make these tiny expressions that show your true emotions.

375
00:16:23,724 --> 00:16:28,927
And you can't see them very well consciously, but your subconscious totally picks up on them.

376
00:16:29,347 --> 00:16:32,189
You ever have that moment someone's saying something you're like something's not right

377
00:16:32,249 --> 00:16:36,771
about that, that guy's trying to pull something. It's often because your subconscious picked up

378
00:16:36,831 --> 00:16:37,792
on a micro expression.

379
00:16:38,232 --> 00:16:40,615
Now, given that those last about 40 milliseconds,

380
00:16:41,035 --> 00:16:43,618
and given that Skype, on average,

381
00:16:43,698 --> 00:16:45,460
gives you about 20 frames a second,

382
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:49,224
you are unlikely to pick up microexpressions through Skype.

383
00:16:50,425 --> 00:16:52,508
Um, so that's important.

384
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,571
Uh, another one is, this is gonna sound really crazy,

385
00:16:55,911 --> 00:16:56,232
smell.

386
00:16:58,037 --> 00:17:04,541
we, a subconscious picks up on the smells of other people and emotions are communicated through smell.

387
00:17:05,122 --> 00:17:09,705
There have been studies done, it's a weird study, right? We have two groups, one group's going to watch a comedy movie,

388
00:17:09,965 --> 00:17:13,528
the other group's going to watch a horror movie, and they each put pads under their armpits,

389
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:19,532
alright, and they watch the movie, and then the pads are collected up, and an unfortunate third group of people

390
00:17:21,694 --> 00:17:23,375
is asked to smell the pads.

391
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:28,142
And better than average, they can tell which movie was being watched.

392
00:17:29,103 --> 00:17:33,667
Because you really can smell fear.

393
00:17:33,867 --> 00:17:35,269
But you can't smell it over Skype.

394
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:36,910
Yet.

395
00:17:38,052 --> 00:17:39,033
No, I don't know what that means.

396
00:17:39,373 --> 00:17:45,299
Anyway, this is important because fear is an important thing on projects.

397
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:47,441
You know, hey, are you going to get that done by Friday?

398
00:17:47,741 --> 00:17:49,443
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm going to get it done, right?

399
00:17:49,767 --> 00:17:50,267
Yeah, really?

400
00:17:50,428 --> 00:17:50,628
Right?

401
00:17:51,108 --> 00:17:54,730
And anyway, so face-to-face is really, really important.

402
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,731
Tone of voice is really important,

403
00:17:56,751 --> 00:18:00,312
which is why even a phone call can be better than email.

404
00:18:00,552 --> 00:18:03,634
But you know, so choosing the right channel of information

405
00:18:03,654 --> 00:18:05,215
at the right time is really important.

406
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:07,416
So now, when it comes to scaling,

407
00:18:09,137 --> 00:18:10,897
people often feel like as their studio's growing,

408
00:18:10,917 --> 00:18:12,938
you hear a lot of thoughts about scale.

409
00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:14,739
There are some people who say, you can never

410
00:18:14,779 --> 00:18:16,380
do a good game with more than five people.

411
00:18:17,085 --> 00:18:20,389
and then as a people's it never do again more twenty people

412
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:24,795
and and uh... but then you see big studios to do the games and what's

413
00:18:24,936 --> 00:18:25,476
exactly

414
00:18:25,777 --> 00:18:26,317
is happening

415
00:18:26,678 --> 00:18:29,542
and why is it different with more people what is it the changes

416
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:31,705
well the key thing is just simply

417
00:18:32,105 --> 00:18:32,366
this

418
00:18:34,716 --> 00:18:37,238
The number of interactions between people

419
00:18:37,779 --> 00:18:40,101
goes up in kind of an exponential way,

420
00:18:40,301 --> 00:18:42,322
technically the triangle numbers pattern, right?

421
00:18:43,443 --> 00:18:46,206
Three people working together, you just, it's easy, right?

422
00:18:46,306 --> 00:18:48,688
You just, the channels of communication are really simple.

423
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:49,889
But even when you get up to something

424
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:51,190
as small as seven people,

425
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:54,993
like look at all those different paths of information.

426
00:18:55,293 --> 00:18:56,694
And this becomes really important.

427
00:18:56,995 --> 00:18:58,356
If you were on a team of five people,

428
00:18:58,536 --> 00:18:59,617
every day when you come in,

429
00:19:00,037 --> 00:19:02,479
you all talk to each other every day.

430
00:19:03,232 --> 00:19:04,493
When you're on a team of 20 people,

431
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:07,337
you're not necessarily going to talk to everybody every day.

432
00:19:07,598 --> 00:19:09,560
But you'll probably talk to everybody,

433
00:19:09,961 --> 00:19:12,184
at least have some minor contact with them once a week.

434
00:19:12,764 --> 00:19:16,525
Once you get up to 50 people, you might go four weeks, six weeks, and there might be

435
00:19:16,585 --> 00:19:20,506
somebody in the studio who you have not exchanged one word with in all that time.

436
00:19:21,106 --> 00:19:24,667
And it may be that they have some super important piece of information for you, but you wouldn't

437
00:19:24,707 --> 00:19:29,009
know it because, you know, because the place is big.

438
00:19:29,849 --> 00:19:35,111
And so what we do is we try and set up organizational structures in order to try and get the right

439
00:19:35,151 --> 00:19:38,652
information to the right places at the right time, because it's not going to happen simply

440
00:19:38,732 --> 00:19:39,632
organically this way.

441
00:19:40,893 --> 00:19:42,094
So this is why we have org charts.

442
00:19:42,135 --> 00:19:44,917
Here's a picture of the org chart for Shell Games.

443
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:50,301
And org charts are typically organized by discipline.

444
00:19:51,202 --> 00:19:53,344
We've got our production team, and our engineering team,

445
00:19:53,364 --> 00:19:54,705
and our design team, and our art team,

446
00:19:55,326 --> 00:19:56,567
and our operations team.

447
00:19:57,427 --> 00:19:59,469
And that's pretty simple and straightforward.

448
00:19:59,589 --> 00:20:01,831
But nowhere in there do you see reflected

449
00:20:01,931 --> 00:20:03,072
anything about our projects.

450
00:20:03,713 --> 00:20:05,774
We do six to eight projects at a time.

451
00:20:06,715 --> 00:20:11,179
But you sure couldn't figure that out by looking at this organizational chart because the point of this

452
00:20:11,699 --> 00:20:13,921
Organization is not to talk about projects

453
00:20:14,121 --> 00:20:19,606
But to talk about specific discipline things to talk about things that have to do with art or talk about design

454
00:20:19,866 --> 00:20:23,790
So a lot this is really very much a chart about mentoring and just sort of getting

455
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:29,094
Information to the right people about their discipline and so for studios to do more than one project

456
00:20:29,134 --> 00:20:33,098
This is why it's become very common to use a form of matrix management

457
00:20:34,002 --> 00:20:35,482
Matrix management is a simple idea.

458
00:20:35,502 --> 00:20:38,763
The idea is that you sort of report to two people

459
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:39,503
when you're on a team.

460
00:20:39,763 --> 00:20:40,383
You report up.

461
00:20:40,483 --> 00:20:42,404
If you're a programmer, you report up

462
00:20:42,444 --> 00:20:44,724
to the head of engineering or head of programming, whatever.

463
00:20:45,204 --> 00:20:47,765
And you work with them on things that

464
00:20:47,805 --> 00:20:50,325
are about long-term mentoring and coaching.

465
00:20:50,686 --> 00:20:52,166
But on your project, someone else

466
00:20:52,246 --> 00:20:53,266
is in charge of your project.

467
00:20:54,566 --> 00:20:57,447
At our place, we always have a producer and a director

468
00:20:57,587 --> 00:20:59,007
at the head of every project.

469
00:20:59,808 --> 00:21:03,170
The director is responsible for the creative vision and making sure it's great.

470
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:07,632
The producer is responsible for making sure it's done on time and that everyone has everything they need.

471
00:21:08,192 --> 00:21:11,735
Now some people say to me, that's a bad idea. You can't have two people in charge of a project.

472
00:21:12,195 --> 00:21:14,096
That's like having two gods. It doesn't work.

473
00:21:15,377 --> 00:21:18,138
And I say, no. I think it's more like having two parents.

474
00:21:18,899 --> 00:21:20,800
It's kind of a good idea sometimes.

475
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,401
And there's a lot of good reasons for that.

476
00:21:22,441 --> 00:21:23,902
They have different areas of expertise.

477
00:21:24,222 --> 00:21:26,343
The people running your project are focused

478
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:27,404
on two different things.

479
00:21:27,584 --> 00:21:29,845
And then similarly, backing out to the matrix management

480
00:21:29,885 --> 00:21:31,666
point of view, there's the people in charge of your

481
00:21:31,686 --> 00:21:33,467
project and the people in charge of your discipline.

482
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:35,509
And it's good to be able to talk to the two of them about

483
00:21:35,549 --> 00:21:36,189
two different things.

484
00:21:37,492 --> 00:21:39,333
people at the head of your project about project issues,

485
00:21:39,433 --> 00:21:41,195
and the person at the head of your department

486
00:21:41,215 --> 00:21:42,295
about longer-term issues.

487
00:21:42,796 --> 00:21:44,477
And if you've got a problem with one of them,

488
00:21:44,857 --> 00:21:46,658
you can go to the other and say, man,

489
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:49,300
you know, I'm hitting a logjam with this guy.

490
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,040
Can you help me?

491
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:52,262
And then they can often help you out.

492
00:21:53,502 --> 00:21:57,025
So the reason matrix management seems to be a good idea

493
00:21:57,045 --> 00:21:59,126
and is used frequently is because it

494
00:21:59,146 --> 00:22:01,287
allows two different kinds of channels of information.

495
00:22:03,715 --> 00:22:07,837
So organizational structure is one tool for managing your flow.

496
00:22:08,437 --> 00:22:10,278
A second one is office space.

497
00:22:11,078 --> 00:22:14,100
Now, everybody rolls their eyes when it comes to office space.

498
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,180
Nobody feels good about it.

499
00:22:16,461 --> 00:22:19,102
People rarely get excited about, yeah, man,

500
00:22:19,162 --> 00:22:20,462
our office is so incredible.

501
00:22:20,522 --> 00:22:21,143
You don't hear that.

502
00:22:21,203 --> 00:22:23,284
People are like, ugh.

503
00:22:23,664 --> 00:22:24,364
It feels bad.

504
00:22:24,404 --> 00:22:25,105
It feels corporate.

505
00:22:25,145 --> 00:22:26,185
And that's often because.

506
00:22:26,986 --> 00:22:27,946
It's not well designed.

507
00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:30,008
Now, it is a hard, hard design problem.

508
00:22:30,929 --> 00:22:35,173
But if you work at it, you can certainly make it better.

509
00:22:35,213 --> 00:22:37,095
So there's a lot of things to think about when you're

510
00:22:37,115 --> 00:22:38,176
designing your office space.

511
00:22:38,897 --> 00:22:41,419
One thing is to realize that a little distance is

512
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:43,561
a lot of distance.

513
00:22:43,741 --> 00:22:46,304
So here's an illustration of a thing I literally saw right

514
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:48,946
outside my desk one day.

515
00:22:48,966 --> 00:22:50,548
We had a project.

516
00:22:50,768 --> 00:22:51,889
There were four people working on it.

517
00:22:52,505 --> 00:22:54,407
and three of them were sitting right next to each other like that.

518
00:22:54,727 --> 00:22:57,710
And then in the middle, you see this kind of a low counter,

519
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:00,492
that green bar up the middle, was just a low counter.

520
00:23:00,552 --> 00:23:01,133
No big deal.

521
00:23:01,233 --> 00:23:02,574
Like people stored things in it.

522
00:23:03,075 --> 00:23:04,396
And on the other side of that counter

523
00:23:04,676 --> 00:23:05,937
was this other guy with his other desk.

524
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:10,762
Couldn't have been more than 15 feet, OK, from those three

525
00:23:10,782 --> 00:23:11,703
desks to that one desk.

526
00:23:12,504 --> 00:23:15,986
And but we were observing that there was some bad communication problem

527
00:23:16,386 --> 00:23:18,448
where that one guy kept getting left out of the loop.

528
00:23:18,888 --> 00:23:20,549
And we're like, man, that guy, is he dope?

529
00:23:20,849 --> 00:23:21,750
Why isn't he talking?

530
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:22,570
Is he just lazy?

531
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:23,171
Is he ignorant?

532
00:23:23,631 --> 00:23:26,673
And then just watching, it's like, oh my god, I could see it happening.

533
00:23:26,693 --> 00:23:28,194
Someone would be like, hey, I've got a problem.

534
00:23:28,534 --> 00:23:29,875
And the guy next to him would say, yeah, what is it?

535
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,156
Well, it's this and this and this.

536
00:23:31,196 --> 00:23:32,917
And the guy over there is kind of like, wait, you guys talk?

537
00:23:33,778 --> 00:23:35,418
And you can see he's kind of listening.

538
00:23:35,438 --> 00:23:36,578
He's like, no, I don't want to interrupt him.

539
00:23:36,598 --> 00:23:37,359
I'll get back to work.

540
00:23:37,719 --> 00:23:39,019
And he was just left out of the loop.

541
00:23:39,259 --> 00:23:41,220
We simply moved his desk over next to the others,

542
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,100
and the problems got so much better.

543
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,841
So thinking about that is really important.

544
00:23:48,841 --> 00:23:50,402
A lot of notable companies have really

545
00:23:50,422 --> 00:23:51,762
gotten aggressive about office space.

546
00:23:51,822 --> 00:23:53,322
Pixar is one that's very notable.

547
00:23:53,842 --> 00:23:56,263
A lot of times you walk into some big fancy company,

548
00:23:56,323 --> 00:23:57,843
and you go into this big open space.

549
00:23:57,983 --> 00:23:59,404
And you do that here when you go to Pixar.

550
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:01,864
And that open space is full of weird sculptures

551
00:24:02,104 --> 00:24:03,405
and creepy security guards.

552
00:24:03,845 --> 00:24:07,066
and like you don't really see it doesn't have any point or purpose of the into

553
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:08,506
intimidate you or whatever

554
00:24:09,246 --> 00:24:10,407
when you walk into pixar

555
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:14,908
you're in the cafeteria let me know that the band is in the places people sit and

556
00:24:15,028 --> 00:24:17,249
eat in the cafeteria you walk right in

557
00:24:18,369 --> 00:24:20,470
it's it's the central hub of the building and

558
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:24,011
the whole space is designed very much to get people to cross through this space

559
00:24:24,071 --> 00:24:25,371
as many times as possible

560
00:24:25,731 --> 00:24:28,332
all the bathrooms for example are in the central space

561
00:24:28,712 --> 00:24:31,353
the offices are often like always the go out to the sides

562
00:24:31,693 --> 00:24:34,195
and people are forced to cross through this many times.

563
00:24:34,275 --> 00:24:36,777
All the meeting rooms, you see all those glass walled things

564
00:24:36,837 --> 00:24:37,077
up there?

565
00:24:37,317 --> 00:24:38,098
Those are the meeting rooms.

566
00:24:38,118 --> 00:24:39,699
You can stand in the middle and kind of see,

567
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:41,400
oh, there's where that guy is.

568
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,661
Oh, look, there's a vacant meeting room.

569
00:24:42,941 --> 00:24:44,543
You can see all that stuff.

570
00:24:46,064 --> 00:24:47,545
It's very, very much designed.

571
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:50,647
Interestingly, Steve Jobs was very, very involved

572
00:24:50,727 --> 00:24:52,609
in the design of this particular space.

573
00:24:53,814 --> 00:24:56,555
We've tried to take a very similar approach in our space,

574
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:58,036
trying to have things be very, very open.

575
00:24:58,056 --> 00:24:59,997
You know, we don't have 1,500 people like Pixar does.

576
00:25:00,017 --> 00:25:00,337
We have about 100.

577
00:25:01,638 --> 00:25:04,420
But we are big fans of open plan.

578
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,222
And so you can see there's most of the folks kind of

579
00:25:08,302 --> 00:25:08,942
working down there.

580
00:25:09,202 --> 00:25:11,764
The way groups are organized is by project.

581
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:13,664
We move desks around all the time.

582
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:15,825
Anytime there's new projects, we get desks

583
00:25:16,085 --> 00:25:17,545
so people can get together.

584
00:25:17,926 --> 00:25:20,046
And you'd think we would maybe organize them

585
00:25:20,106 --> 00:25:22,667
by those kind of islands that you see,

586
00:25:22,887 --> 00:25:25,867
but they're really organized by canals, okay?

587
00:25:26,128 --> 00:25:28,208
So people with back-to-back are the ones

588
00:25:28,268 --> 00:25:29,708
working on projects together because

589
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:31,449
someone could say, hey, can you take a look at this?

590
00:25:31,669 --> 00:25:33,549
And they can just turn around and take a look.

591
00:25:33,809 --> 00:25:35,910
It's very different than, oh, can you walk all the way around

592
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:37,390
the island and come and see us?

593
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:40,151
It's just a small design thing, but it makes a big difference.

594
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:43,068
Okay, so office space is really important.

595
00:25:43,088 --> 00:25:44,391
There's so, there's a, that's, that's,

596
00:25:44,631 --> 00:25:46,213
I could talk about that for, for days and days.

597
00:25:46,614 --> 00:25:47,916
But let's talk about other things.

598
00:25:48,377 --> 00:25:51,923
Another really important flow management tool is ritual.

599
00:25:52,483 --> 00:25:56,330
And our most common ritual is meetings, right?

600
00:25:58,532 --> 00:26:02,374
And people mostly don't feel great about meetings,

601
00:26:02,514 --> 00:26:04,534
because there's a lot of bad meetings, because no one

602
00:26:04,594 --> 00:26:06,195
bothers to design them.

603
00:26:06,735 --> 00:26:08,596
Well-designed meetings are awesome.

604
00:26:09,556 --> 00:26:10,817
You go in, you get stuff done.

605
00:26:10,937 --> 00:26:12,297
It was like, oh, that really helped me.

606
00:26:12,317 --> 00:26:14,038
You come out thinking, man, now I know what's going on.

607
00:26:14,298 --> 00:26:15,018
That really helped me.

608
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:17,039
Now I can work with more confidence.

609
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:18,780
I know exactly what's going on.

610
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,680
Badly designed meetings are awesome.

611
00:26:21,258 --> 00:26:22,938
I don't know, the ninth level of hell.

612
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,459
They're really, really bad.

613
00:26:25,499 --> 00:26:27,000
And there's a lot of ways to design meetings.

614
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:29,120
People who do, actually, hands up, people who do Agile.

615
00:26:29,341 --> 00:26:30,421
I'm curious.

616
00:26:30,561 --> 00:26:30,921
Look at this.

617
00:26:30,961 --> 00:26:31,861
There's a lot of Agile here.

618
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:33,902
And there's a lot of people like, I don't do Agile.

619
00:26:33,962 --> 00:26:34,602
Maybe I should.

620
00:26:34,622 --> 00:26:35,102
I don't know.

621
00:26:35,703 --> 00:26:36,603
Or I hate Agile.

622
00:26:36,623 --> 00:26:37,283
It's stupid jerks.

623
00:26:37,363 --> 00:26:38,163
You know, it's a lot of things.

624
00:26:38,564 --> 00:26:40,664
But anyway, one of the key elements of Agile

625
00:26:40,804 --> 00:26:42,345
is the notion of the Scrum meeting.

626
00:26:42,405 --> 00:26:45,066
And this is very, very much a designed meeting.

627
00:26:45,346 --> 00:26:46,366
The idea is it's very short.

628
00:26:46,626 --> 00:26:49,107
You're talking about a very small number of things.

629
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,061
And often, part of the design is people say,

630
00:26:52,101 --> 00:26:53,201
this is a standing meeting.

631
00:26:53,221 --> 00:26:55,162
There'll be no sitting down in this meeting

632
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:57,143
because we want to get this done and get back to work

633
00:26:57,203 --> 00:27:00,304
and not turn this into a waste of time.

634
00:27:00,724 --> 00:27:01,324
And so that's cool.

635
00:27:01,364 --> 00:27:03,585
Look at these happy people having their scrum meeting

636
00:27:03,645 --> 00:27:04,025
right here.

637
00:27:04,965 --> 00:27:05,746
And you know why they're happy?

638
00:27:05,766 --> 00:27:07,646
Because they're out of those horrible cubicles

639
00:27:07,666 --> 00:27:08,086
that they're in.

640
00:27:08,106 --> 00:27:08,686
Look at those.

641
00:27:09,407 --> 00:27:11,367
Those are like the worst of both worlds

642
00:27:11,447 --> 00:27:13,008
when it comes to cubicles, right?

643
00:27:14,869 --> 00:27:16,489
Because look at the height of those.

644
00:27:16,749 --> 00:27:17,849
You go back and sit in that.

645
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,891
Do you have noise protection?

646
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:22,193
Are you like, I'm in my isolated pod?

647
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:22,593
No.

648
00:27:22,853 --> 00:27:24,995
There's all the potential noise of the studio is there.

649
00:27:25,195 --> 00:27:27,557
Can you see where anyone is or what anyone is doing?

650
00:27:27,917 --> 00:27:28,077
No.

651
00:27:28,357 --> 00:27:29,879
Even if you stand up, you can't.

652
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:32,200
You've got to peek up over the wall.

653
00:27:32,421 --> 00:27:35,083
So it's like this illusion of, I have a big important office,

654
00:27:35,523 --> 00:27:38,425
but with all the horrible aspects of that.

655
00:27:39,026 --> 00:27:42,408
I am not a fan of the six foot high cube wall.

656
00:27:43,409 --> 00:27:46,271
OK, so talking more broadly about Agile.

657
00:27:47,652 --> 00:27:51,556
Agile is really just a system of coordinating and organizing

658
00:27:51,677 --> 00:27:53,078
information flow.

659
00:27:53,587 --> 00:27:53,767
right?

660
00:27:53,967 --> 00:27:55,968
You've got your product backlog.

661
00:27:56,228 --> 00:27:57,509
These are all the things that we would

662
00:27:57,549 --> 00:27:58,529
like to put into the game.

663
00:27:59,049 --> 00:28:02,991
And then you organize sprints, these little two, three, four

664
00:28:03,031 --> 00:28:06,672
week sessions where you have a very specific goal.

665
00:28:06,932 --> 00:28:08,012
Everyone knows the goal.

666
00:28:08,052 --> 00:28:09,513
You've communicated the goal clearly.

667
00:28:09,613 --> 00:28:11,874
We're going to deliver this at the end of 30 days.

668
00:28:12,694 --> 00:28:16,315
And then once a day, you have your Scrum meeting

669
00:28:16,555 --> 00:28:17,836
where what did you do yesterday?

670
00:28:17,856 --> 00:28:18,536
What did you do today?

671
00:28:18,576 --> 00:28:19,456
What problems are you having?

672
00:28:19,536 --> 00:28:19,897
OK, good.

673
00:28:19,917 --> 00:28:20,617
Let's get back to work.

674
00:28:20,957 --> 00:28:21,617
And let's change it.

675
00:28:22,077 --> 00:28:23,418
so that we know what we're doing.

676
00:28:24,818 --> 00:28:27,539
And that's all very much about organizing information flow

677
00:28:27,579 --> 00:28:31,480
about what we're doing so that you can optimize continually

678
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,480
on the project.

679
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,521
Fred Brooks, author of the Mythical Man-Month,

680
00:28:35,681 --> 00:28:38,762
you know, he was looking at how bad software projects tend to go

681
00:28:39,582 --> 00:28:40,563
and someone was saying,

682
00:28:40,583 --> 00:28:42,043
look, I don't understand you software people.

683
00:28:42,083 --> 00:28:43,404
You said it was going to be out by this date

684
00:28:43,864 --> 00:28:46,164
and you were a year late.

685
00:28:47,045 --> 00:28:48,785
I can understand somebody being two days late

686
00:28:48,945 --> 00:28:50,946
or a week late, a year late.

687
00:28:51,824 --> 00:28:53,926
How are you a year late for something?

688
00:28:54,587 --> 00:28:56,429
Yeah, don't worry, honey, I'll meet you at 5 o'clock.

689
00:28:56,529 --> 00:28:57,870
Oh, sorry, I'm a year late.

690
00:28:59,632 --> 00:28:59,893
Right?

691
00:29:00,813 --> 00:29:04,357
And his answer is, you get a year late one day at a time.

692
00:29:04,497 --> 00:29:05,678
That is how you do it.

693
00:29:05,959 --> 00:29:08,521
And so the idea is to do this sort of daily management so

694
00:29:08,541 --> 00:29:11,484
that you can steer the project, get the right information to

695
00:29:11,504 --> 00:29:12,085
the right people.

696
00:29:13,022 --> 00:29:14,143
and steer your project.

697
00:29:14,423 --> 00:29:17,984
OK, so Agile is really a system of information flow.

698
00:29:18,744 --> 00:29:21,625
So another popular thing, popular with some people,

699
00:29:21,665 --> 00:29:25,287
less popular with others, is the notion of 360 feedback.

700
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:29,048
People tend to dread feedback reviews at work.

701
00:29:29,428 --> 00:29:31,169
Most of the time, the people giving the reviews

702
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,590
don't know what they're doing because they're not

703
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:34,430
experts in this.

704
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:35,890
It's super awkward.

705
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:37,371
You're having this awkward conversation

706
00:29:37,391 --> 00:29:39,532
about what you're good at and what you're bad at.

707
00:29:39,992 --> 00:29:41,232
And like, do I trust this guy?

708
00:29:41,272 --> 00:29:42,373
And is this guy going to believe me?

709
00:29:44,126 --> 00:29:46,547
Often this is because it's badly designed.

710
00:29:47,047 --> 00:29:49,407
Well-designed 360 feedback is an opportunity

711
00:29:49,447 --> 00:29:51,528
to collect feedback from all the people

712
00:29:51,568 --> 00:29:54,009
that somebody works with and get all the information

713
00:29:54,269 --> 00:29:56,790
that maybe they say to each other, but maybe they don't,

714
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:58,670
because it's really awkward.

715
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,311
Like, dude, your BO is killing me, right?

716
00:30:01,671 --> 00:30:04,072
That is not a conversation that two employees will often have.

717
00:30:04,411 --> 00:30:07,833
But sometimes it's the sort of thing that will come out in anonymous 360 feedback.

718
00:30:08,113 --> 00:30:12,295
If it's anonymous, and you can guarantee the information is not going to go,

719
00:30:12,395 --> 00:30:17,138
it will often go up to one of the managers who can kind of have this conversation.

720
00:30:17,458 --> 00:30:20,680
Which makes it essential that the people who are giving these reviews

721
00:30:21,381 --> 00:30:25,723
know how to do them well and understand how to do it tactfully and usefully.

722
00:30:26,263 --> 00:30:30,806
If a good manager collects the information from a bunch of people, processes it,

723
00:30:31,206 --> 00:30:35,808
so that they figure out, okay, these are the useful things I want to pass on and discuss

724
00:30:36,108 --> 00:30:38,209
and hear this person's feedback about,

725
00:30:38,229 --> 00:30:42,651
and it becomes a conversation. And if you do this right, people don't dread

726
00:30:42,891 --> 00:30:46,813
the reviews. They get useful information that helps them,

727
00:30:47,113 --> 00:30:50,134
and it can be very, very positive, but you have to take it

728
00:30:50,334 --> 00:30:53,396
seriously. One thing we recently did, because we realized...

729
00:30:53,976 --> 00:30:56,637
you know it's tough to fit these in your like i want to focus on the game i don't

730
00:30:56,657 --> 00:30:58,357
want to focus on filling out forms and

731
00:30:58,877 --> 00:31:01,518
and um... and i sit down having uncomfortable conversations

732
00:31:01,718 --> 00:31:02,859
c ten to put it off

733
00:31:03,219 --> 00:31:04,339
and we've been doing that

734
00:31:04,639 --> 00:31:06,060
and that really sends this message that

735
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,020
if you put this off it must not be important

736
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,061
but it's super important this is all about

737
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:12,822
making everybody the best person they can be

738
00:31:13,222 --> 00:31:17,183
so we've rescheduled it now instead of doing all once a year or uh... once every

739
00:31:17,323 --> 00:31:17,423
uh...

740
00:31:18,223 --> 00:31:18,803
uh... six months

741
00:31:19,663 --> 00:31:22,065
We spread them out so they fit into people's schedules

742
00:31:22,385 --> 00:31:23,706
so that they're not an intrusion.

743
00:31:24,086 --> 00:31:25,347
And that's made it much more comfortable.

744
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:27,469
And again, it helps send the signal that, look,

745
00:31:27,489 --> 00:31:28,289
this is important to us.

746
00:31:28,309 --> 00:31:29,170
We make time for this.

747
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:31,371
So there are many, many types of meetings.

748
00:31:31,511 --> 00:31:32,592
Any kind of meeting that you have

749
00:31:32,632 --> 00:31:34,434
is a sort of ritual that your company has.

750
00:31:34,474 --> 00:31:35,775
And you want to design that so it's good.

751
00:31:36,155 --> 00:31:37,396
Some of those are short and daily.

752
00:31:37,516 --> 00:31:38,436
Many of them are weekly.

753
00:31:38,716 --> 00:31:40,397
Some of them you do every, like, four times a year.

754
00:31:41,138 --> 00:31:42,539
And then there's some you do annually.

755
00:31:42,619 --> 00:31:44,560
One that we do that was worked out really well for us

756
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,121
is this notion of Jam Week.

757
00:31:46,161 --> 00:31:48,822
We stop everything that the studio is doing once a year,

758
00:31:49,463 --> 00:31:51,624
and we say, you know what?

759
00:31:51,664 --> 00:31:52,945
Let's have people work on projects

760
00:31:53,005 --> 00:31:54,586
that they are excited about,

761
00:31:54,626 --> 00:31:56,687
that they think might be good to go somewhere.

762
00:31:56,987 --> 00:31:59,229
You know, just something good could come with this.

763
00:31:59,409 --> 00:32:03,913
Either my personal development, or maybe just something

764
00:32:03,933 --> 00:32:06,094
that would be really good for the studio.

765
00:32:06,495 --> 00:32:09,057
Now, is this an information flow management situation?

766
00:32:09,137 --> 00:32:09,797
It totally is.

767
00:32:09,877 --> 00:32:11,699
People have ideas for things that they'd like to do,

768
00:32:11,979 --> 00:32:13,780
and it's blocked because it's not

769
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,281
part of their regular daily project.

770
00:32:15,742 --> 00:32:18,484
This creates an opportunity for like, hey,

771
00:32:18,524 --> 00:32:20,165
that cool idea bouncing around in your head.

772
00:32:20,525 --> 00:32:21,425
We're making time.

773
00:32:21,666 --> 00:32:22,406
It's important to us.

774
00:32:22,426 --> 00:32:25,109
We're making time for it to come out and for you to experiment

775
00:32:25,169 --> 00:32:26,169
and connect with other people.

776
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:27,310
And good things come of it.

777
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:32,334
Last year, one of ours was this Enemy Mind game that came out.

778
00:32:32,435 --> 00:32:35,057
And everybody liked it so much, after a one-week prototype,

779
00:32:35,277 --> 00:32:36,878
they were like, let's turn this into a real project.

780
00:32:36,918 --> 00:32:39,100
And it got a Best in Play award last year at GDC.

781
00:32:39,761 --> 00:32:40,822
And one of the ones we did this year

782
00:32:40,862 --> 00:32:42,923
is this Orion Trail game, which we currently

783
00:32:42,963 --> 00:32:43,824
have in Kickstarter.

784
00:32:44,204 --> 00:32:46,686
And it's in its final week, so please back it.

785
00:32:47,387 --> 00:32:49,649
I think we're going to make it, but it's a little close.

786
00:32:49,709 --> 00:32:52,592
So anyway, if you could back that, that would be great.

787
00:32:52,912 --> 00:32:55,274
Anyway, but it's exciting.

788
00:32:55,334 --> 00:32:58,137
I mean, people get really energized

789
00:32:58,277 --> 00:33:00,339
when the things they're excited about come to light.

790
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:02,421
And you have to make channels for that to happen.

791
00:33:02,862 --> 00:33:04,303
But there's lots of other rituals.

792
00:33:04,543 --> 00:33:06,926
There's this great story I read about on the Harvard Business

793
00:33:06,946 --> 00:33:07,666
Review I just love.

794
00:33:08,067 --> 00:33:08,908
This company where

795
00:33:09,388 --> 00:33:11,290
They didn't have a modern coffee pot.

796
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:14,072
They had this clanky, old, percolator coffee pot.

797
00:33:14,393 --> 00:33:16,755
Only two people in the office knew how to operate it properly

798
00:33:16,795 --> 00:33:18,216
and not get grounds in all the coffee.

799
00:33:19,698 --> 00:33:23,799
And so when they would make coffee, they would get the coffee going and they'd say,

800
00:33:24,139 --> 00:33:26,140
you know, hey everybody, coffee's ready.

801
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,901
And everybody would come for coffee and everyone would hang out in the kitchen,

802
00:33:28,961 --> 00:33:32,262
chatting and stuff, and a lot of useful information was flowing around.

803
00:33:32,682 --> 00:33:36,583
And the guy who was the head of the studio, he's like, yeah, no, that's great.

804
00:33:36,603 --> 00:33:37,043
Look at this.

805
00:33:37,063 --> 00:33:37,763
This is so cool.

806
00:33:37,803 --> 00:33:39,884
I love our little coffee times and everybody's talking.

807
00:33:40,244 --> 00:33:42,225
This is cool. This is cool and good and useful.

808
00:33:42,525 --> 00:33:45,786
But jeez, I feel terrible that everyone's got this terrible coffee pot.

809
00:33:46,266 --> 00:33:48,446
Right? So you know what I'm going to do, because coffee time is so important,

810
00:33:48,466 --> 00:33:50,647
I'm going to get one of these fancy, modern, K-cup things.

811
00:33:50,687 --> 00:33:53,168
That way you guys have awesome coffee, customized coffee,

812
00:33:53,548 --> 00:33:56,028
just the coffee you want, any time you want,

813
00:33:56,589 --> 00:33:58,809
one cup at a time, and coffee time went away.

814
00:33:59,589 --> 00:34:03,751
And this really useful ritual that had been part of an information passing thing

815
00:34:03,771 --> 00:34:06,811
in the studio went away, and it led to problems.

816
00:34:06,991 --> 00:34:09,172
These things are super, super subtle.

817
00:34:10,185 --> 00:34:13,386
And I know it's silly to kind of talk about things centering around food, but food is

818
00:34:13,447 --> 00:34:15,488
super important to us as humans.

819
00:34:15,968 --> 00:34:21,111
In our triune structure of the brain, the back part, the most basic part, is like very

820
00:34:21,151 --> 00:34:25,613
interested in food and it has strong opinions about food, right?

821
00:34:26,093 --> 00:34:28,975
Go into any college cafeteria, right?

822
00:34:29,215 --> 00:34:31,977
You go into a college classroom and you look at like people sitting around and you're like,

823
00:34:32,017 --> 00:34:33,958
wow, look at this international mix of people.

824
00:34:34,298 --> 00:34:36,939
And then you go to the cafeteria and look at the segregation

825
00:34:36,979 --> 00:34:38,179
that happens in the cafeteria.

826
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:39,900
Because there's something in us that's like,

827
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,500
I want to eat with people like me,

828
00:34:42,101 --> 00:34:45,182
because those other people might take my food.

829
00:34:45,622 --> 00:34:47,463
And then further, it goes the other way.

830
00:34:48,343 --> 00:34:49,223
It goes the other way.

831
00:34:49,303 --> 00:34:52,744
If you eat a meal with someone you haven't eaten a meal with

832
00:34:52,784 --> 00:34:56,046
before, your brain's like, that dude didn't take my food.

833
00:34:58,086 --> 00:35:00,807
I can trust that guy on a kind of a deep, fundamental level.

834
00:35:03,537 --> 00:35:05,978
So a lot of studios, they do a thing where, we're so cool, man.

835
00:35:06,018 --> 00:35:07,599
We got free lunches every day.

836
00:35:07,659 --> 00:35:10,680
We got an omelet chef who comes at 3 o'clock every day.

837
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,460
And you never have to leave the studio.

838
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,201
Isn't that great?

839
00:35:13,721 --> 00:35:14,501
No, that's not great.

840
00:35:14,801 --> 00:35:15,701
Never leave the studio.

841
00:35:15,721 --> 00:35:18,722
It means you're kind of stuck in the same rut all the time.

842
00:35:19,143 --> 00:35:19,703
And what do you do?

843
00:35:19,763 --> 00:35:21,183
You go in, you're the omelet chef.

844
00:35:21,203 --> 00:35:21,704
You get your omelet.

845
00:35:21,724 --> 00:35:22,584
You go back to your desk.

846
00:35:22,624 --> 00:35:25,025
There's no conversation, right?

847
00:35:25,385 --> 00:35:26,685
So I don't like to do that.

848
00:35:26,725 --> 00:35:28,586
We do that a little bit, a little free food once in a while.

849
00:35:28,926 --> 00:35:30,206
But like every day?

850
00:35:30,578 --> 00:35:34,587
Because what you want is you want people to get together and go out of the studio,

851
00:35:34,607 --> 00:35:38,996
because that changes their point of view, and you want them to kind of bond up in social situations.

852
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:45,132
The hunting party, man, that's an old fundamental notion.

853
00:35:45,352 --> 00:35:45,952
And you see it.

854
00:35:46,653 --> 00:35:48,914
Someone's like, hey, you guys want to get frozen yogurt?

855
00:35:49,094 --> 00:35:50,455
I'm like, oh, OK, yeah, let's all go.

856
00:35:50,675 --> 00:35:51,215
And they're going.

857
00:35:51,255 --> 00:35:52,336
And you see that walk.

858
00:35:52,356 --> 00:35:53,417
There's that walk they're doing.

859
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:56,418
They're just going down to hunt down to host

860
00:35:56,458 --> 00:35:57,479
his Twinkie or whatever.

861
00:35:58,820 --> 00:35:59,640
But still, you see it.

862
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:02,022
And there's a sort of bonding that happens around it.

863
00:36:02,742 --> 00:36:03,182
And that happens.

864
00:36:03,222 --> 00:36:05,123
And a lot of useful conversation happens there.

865
00:36:05,604 --> 00:36:08,245
So when you give out free food at a studio,

866
00:36:08,265 --> 00:36:10,867
you're often blocking really useful information flow.

867
00:36:12,247 --> 00:36:14,008
Also, I'm very cheap.

868
00:36:14,428 --> 00:36:14,709
OK.

869
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:20,852
So another flow management tool is just social factors.

870
00:36:21,092 --> 00:36:24,635
So much about information is about who likes who and who

871
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:25,595
likes talking to whom.

872
00:36:25,895 --> 00:36:26,696
Look at this team.

873
00:36:27,436 --> 00:36:28,817
That looks like a team that is going to

874
00:36:28,857 --> 00:36:31,019
communicate pretty well.

875
00:36:31,259 --> 00:36:32,660
You can tell just by kind of looking.

876
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,362
Like, these guys are very, very comfortable with each other.

877
00:36:35,402 --> 00:36:39,287
They're going to be, it's going to be easy for them to share information with each other.

878
00:36:39,527 --> 00:36:40,988
So now there's been a lot of research about this.

879
00:36:41,249 --> 00:36:44,572
Some of the most interesting, I think, is this research by Dr. Anita Woolley.

880
00:36:46,134 --> 00:36:48,436
And it's all about the notion of collective intelligence.

881
00:36:48,697 --> 00:36:50,859
We've had intelligence tests for years and years and years.

882
00:36:51,139 --> 00:36:53,502
We understand about measuring individual intelligence.

883
00:36:54,182 --> 00:36:56,924
Her question was, what about the intelligence of a group?

884
00:36:57,144 --> 00:36:57,944
How does that work?

885
00:36:58,404 --> 00:37:00,686
Now, a lot of people would say, well, that's easy.

886
00:37:00,786 --> 00:37:02,306
You just take the IQs of everybody in the group

887
00:37:02,467 --> 00:37:03,847
and you average it?

888
00:37:04,548 --> 00:37:05,628
No, you take the maximum?

889
00:37:06,188 --> 00:37:07,149
No, you take the min?

890
00:37:07,369 --> 00:37:07,729
I don't know.

891
00:37:07,869 --> 00:37:08,290
What do you do?

892
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:10,131
And she found it has nothing to do with that.

893
00:37:10,271 --> 00:37:12,232
The intelligence of the people in the group

894
00:37:12,632 --> 00:37:14,613
individually doesn't matter very much

895
00:37:14,813 --> 00:37:17,234
in terms of the collective intelligence of the group.

896
00:37:17,754 --> 00:37:20,316
Her studies found that there were exactly three factors.

897
00:37:20,776 --> 00:37:24,078
that were critical when it came to the intelligent behavior

898
00:37:24,438 --> 00:37:24,858
of a group.

899
00:37:25,298 --> 00:37:27,960
And she did this by giving groups these different tests.

900
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,821
So here are the three factors she found were really relevant.

901
00:37:31,261 --> 00:37:35,103
The first one is, how do people perform on the eyes test?

902
00:37:35,763 --> 00:37:38,585
Okay? So the eyes test is this interesting test

903
00:37:38,605 --> 00:37:40,005
where you see a lot of pictures like this.

904
00:37:41,266 --> 00:37:42,727
Right? How is she feeling right now?

905
00:37:44,267 --> 00:37:45,228
A, B, C, or D?

906
00:37:46,549 --> 00:37:47,389
So think about that.

907
00:37:47,409 --> 00:37:48,369
See if you got the answer.

908
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:49,910
All right?

909
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:58,831
All right. All right. Hands up for A. Hands up for B. Hands up for C. Hands up for D.

910
00:37:59,793 --> 00:38:02,577
Okay. The correct answer is A. Okay.

911
00:38:04,393 --> 00:38:05,634
All right, you can go, Harley.

912
00:38:06,214 --> 00:38:09,657
Anyway, groups that had people who performed really well

913
00:38:09,677 --> 00:38:11,799
on this test, because some people are great at it,

914
00:38:12,099 --> 00:38:13,601
and some people are really bad at it.

915
00:38:13,681 --> 00:38:15,302
Groups who had people who were really good at this

916
00:38:15,722 --> 00:38:16,883
ended up being more intelligent.

917
00:38:17,644 --> 00:38:20,426
Second one, conversational turn-taking.

918
00:38:20,867 --> 00:38:22,608
They measured the amount of times

919
00:38:22,668 --> 00:38:24,209
that people interrupted each other.

920
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:26,852
Groups that interrupted each other a lot

921
00:38:27,092 --> 00:38:28,693
behaved really stupidly.

922
00:38:30,064 --> 00:38:32,506
Groups that let each other talk, let each other finish,

923
00:38:32,646 --> 00:38:35,609
and had a good balance of conversational turn taking,

924
00:38:35,989 --> 00:38:37,711
they behave very intelligently.

925
00:38:38,611 --> 00:38:40,433
And number three, get ready.

926
00:38:41,614 --> 00:38:42,975
Boom goes the dynamite.

927
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,123
More ladies in the group made it behave smarter.

928
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:04,893
Now, so, and groups with no ladies, they had certain pathologies that were really, really

929
00:39:04,913 --> 00:39:08,555
bad. And I'm sure some of us have seen this, right? You got a group of dudes all together,

930
00:39:08,895 --> 00:39:12,637
and they're like, we should put in nine features. No, let's put in ten. No, let's put in eleven.

931
00:39:12,797 --> 00:39:17,299
That's awesome, let's do it, right? And then that's how you get a year late, right? That's

932
00:39:17,339 --> 00:39:18,760
totally how that happens.

933
00:39:19,717 --> 00:39:20,837
But there's something that happens.

934
00:39:20,918 --> 00:39:22,479
It's not that if there's a woman in the group,

935
00:39:22,539 --> 00:39:25,481
it's not that the woman comes in and says, no, everybody, stop.

936
00:39:26,161 --> 00:39:27,342
Everybody behaves different.

937
00:39:27,683 --> 00:39:29,824
Again, the back of the brain behaves a little different.

938
00:39:29,944 --> 00:39:31,205
The male brain behaves a little different

939
00:39:31,225 --> 00:39:32,646
when the ladies are around.

940
00:39:33,167 --> 00:39:34,528
It's like, let's put 9, no, 10.

941
00:39:34,668 --> 00:39:37,670
No, actually, maybe we shouldn't be so dangerous all the time.

942
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:39,612
Maybe we should actually play a little safer.

943
00:39:39,652 --> 00:39:40,572
So there's something in that.

944
00:39:41,073 --> 00:39:42,594
Now, I got together with Dr. Woolley

945
00:39:42,614 --> 00:39:43,975
because I'm like, OK, Dr. Woolley,

946
00:39:43,995 --> 00:39:47,237
I've seen a lot of student teams, a lot, like thousands.

947
00:39:47,798 --> 00:39:47,918
And.

948
00:39:48,898 --> 00:39:50,519
I've seen certain pathologies with all male groups,

949
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:53,219
and I see certain pathologies with all female groups.

950
00:39:53,339 --> 00:39:56,120
I've seen some all female groups do some really nutty things that

951
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,080
are really, really different.

952
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,941
And she said, yeah, you know, honestly,

953
00:39:59,181 --> 00:40:00,661
we didn't test the all female case.

954
00:40:01,681 --> 00:40:03,242
And she's like, I'm working on it now.

955
00:40:03,262 --> 00:40:04,922
But she's like, yeah, I see the same thing,

956
00:40:05,382 --> 00:40:07,502
that when there's a mix is when it's best.

957
00:40:08,623 --> 00:40:10,283
And so that's really interesting to know

958
00:40:10,383 --> 00:40:11,143
and interesting to think about.

959
00:40:11,383 --> 00:40:13,344
Exactly why is a little unclear, but it's

960
00:40:13,404 --> 00:40:14,124
a thing to think about.

961
00:40:14,224 --> 00:40:16,284
And given the game industry isn't very well balanced

962
00:40:16,304 --> 00:40:18,245
this way, it's something important to consider.

963
00:40:19,919 --> 00:40:21,139
OK, so we got all those things.

964
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:22,320
Those are some tools you can use.

965
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:24,460
So now let's talk about what blocks information,

966
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,101
because there's a lot of things that can block information

967
00:40:27,161 --> 00:40:28,021
flow in your studio.

968
00:40:28,361 --> 00:40:30,082
A lot of times, oh, man, it's too much trouble.

969
00:40:30,602 --> 00:40:31,882
Yeah, I was going to tell them, but I'm busy,

970
00:40:31,922 --> 00:40:33,702
and I'm just not going to do that.

971
00:40:34,203 --> 00:40:35,763
Another time, oh, man, I didn't know.

972
00:40:36,383 --> 00:40:40,604
Oh my god, you guys are building like a vector-based calculation

973
00:40:40,644 --> 00:40:40,904
system.

974
00:40:40,944 --> 00:40:41,784
I didn't know we've got one.

975
00:40:41,865 --> 00:40:42,445
It's already done.

976
00:40:42,465 --> 00:40:44,845
Oh, I could have saved you three months of work,

977
00:40:45,145 --> 00:40:47,426
but I just didn't know that you needed it.

978
00:40:48,563 --> 00:40:49,644
Another one is noise.

979
00:40:49,804 --> 00:40:51,124
Now, of course, there's lots of kinds of noise.

980
00:40:51,184 --> 00:40:52,904
There's a lot of kinds.

981
00:40:53,124 --> 00:40:55,385
There's certainly the noise in your head.

982
00:40:55,605 --> 00:40:57,205
You're worried about some personal problem,

983
00:40:57,565 --> 00:41:00,346
or oh my god, oh my god, I'm going to get fired, whatever.

984
00:41:00,706 --> 00:41:02,106
Noise in your head is not going to help you.

985
00:41:02,306 --> 00:41:04,967
So you want to find ways to reduce the noise in your head.

986
00:41:05,567 --> 00:41:07,787
There's actual noise in the office.

987
00:41:08,867 --> 00:41:10,108
That can block information flow.

988
00:41:10,128 --> 00:41:11,988
Anyone who's ever been to a party at the minute gallery

989
00:41:12,368 --> 00:41:13,008
knows about that.

990
00:41:13,748 --> 00:41:15,429
Hey, man, I haven't seen you for a year.

991
00:41:15,449 --> 00:41:17,429
And then DJ Earbud comes on.

992
00:41:17,469 --> 00:41:18,289
Doot-de-doot-de-doot.

993
00:41:19,896 --> 00:41:21,116
for an hour, and you're like, oh, anyway.

994
00:41:21,436 --> 00:41:23,497
So that doesn't usually happen in the office.

995
00:41:24,157 --> 00:41:26,398
But sometimes, you know, offices can be really noisy.

996
00:41:26,458 --> 00:41:29,679
In our place, we put up sound padding around

997
00:41:29,699 --> 00:41:31,680
because there was echo that was a little irritating.

998
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,961
We put the sound padding, and it was better.

999
00:41:34,161 --> 00:41:35,282
The communication was a little clearer.

1000
00:41:36,302 --> 00:41:37,542
But then there's other ones, interruptions.

1001
00:41:37,603 --> 00:41:39,623
People come in and bug in you all the time.

1002
00:41:39,863 --> 00:41:41,924
A lot of places have developed kind of an informal code

1003
00:41:41,944 --> 00:41:43,885
of, hey, if I've got headphones on, don't bother me.

1004
00:41:44,105 --> 00:41:45,265
I'm busy right now, right?

1005
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:48,128
Another one is lying.

1006
00:41:49,188 --> 00:41:51,229
Lying is a kind of noise on information.

1007
00:41:51,689 --> 00:41:53,369
Someone's delivering information,

1008
00:41:53,409 --> 00:41:54,830
but it's not the right information.

1009
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:55,710
It's all noised up.

1010
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:59,211
And one that we get a lot, noise from the publisher.

1011
00:42:00,591 --> 00:42:02,171
You're trying to make your game, and the publisher comes in

1012
00:42:02,191 --> 00:42:03,591
with some weird thing.

1013
00:42:04,312 --> 00:42:05,492
And really?

1014
00:42:05,512 --> 00:42:06,952
That's not a good.

1015
00:42:08,072 --> 00:42:10,073
And it kind of noises up a lot of your information.

1016
00:42:10,093 --> 00:42:11,773
There's a lot of meddling that publishers do.

1017
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:17,769
and people get frustrated about that, but Stephen Beeman explained this with the Beeman's

1018
00:42:17,889 --> 00:42:22,151
Meddling Matrix. So let's talk about this. It's very important to understand the reasons,

1019
00:42:22,211 --> 00:42:25,852
the good, excellent reasons that there is so much meddling from a publisher. So let's

1020
00:42:25,872 --> 00:42:30,494
look at these axes. Okay, let's look at projects. Some projects succeed, some projects fail.

1021
00:42:31,477 --> 00:42:33,717
Some projects have a lot of meddling from the publisher.

1022
00:42:33,877 --> 00:42:35,818
Some projects have no meddling from the publisher.

1023
00:42:36,358 --> 00:42:38,138
OK, so let's look at these four different axes.

1024
00:42:38,658 --> 00:42:40,319
Think about this from the producer

1025
00:42:40,379 --> 00:42:41,339
at the publisher's point of view.

1026
00:42:41,379 --> 00:42:42,539
This is the guy who's got to oversee

1027
00:42:42,579 --> 00:42:44,080
this stupid group of game developers

1028
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,780
that we hired to do this, and they're so crazy,

1029
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:46,640
and what are we going to do?

1030
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,701
So this guy's got to decide, how much

1031
00:42:48,741 --> 00:42:50,581
am I going to meddle on this project,

1032
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:51,741
because I want it to succeed?

1033
00:42:52,162 --> 00:42:53,222
What's the right amount of meddling?

1034
00:42:53,282 --> 00:42:54,482
Well, let's look at this case.

1035
00:42:56,003 --> 00:42:58,505
So let's say it's a really successful project,

1036
00:42:58,565 --> 00:42:59,645
and the guy meddles a lot.

1037
00:43:00,185 --> 00:43:02,006
His conclusion will be, my meddling worked.

1038
00:43:02,626 --> 00:43:03,367
That was excellent.

1039
00:43:03,687 --> 00:43:03,967
OK.

1040
00:43:04,587 --> 00:43:05,728
So then let's look at this case.

1041
00:43:07,248 --> 00:43:09,209
He doesn't meddle, and it succeeds.

1042
00:43:09,689 --> 00:43:11,270
Then he's going to be like, oh my god, I'm useless.

1043
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:13,431
If anybody finds out how little I was involved

1044
00:43:13,471 --> 00:43:16,152
in this massive hit, it would be bad.

1045
00:43:16,332 --> 00:43:19,033
So man, that would be bad if that happened.

1046
00:43:19,093 --> 00:43:20,874
So that's incentive to kind of get in there

1047
00:43:20,894 --> 00:43:22,194
and meddle if the thing's going to be successful.

1048
00:43:23,252 --> 00:43:27,013
Now let's look at this one, a failed project

1049
00:43:27,133 --> 00:43:28,614
where the publisher was super hands off.

1050
00:43:29,414 --> 00:43:32,235
That guy's going to get so beat up by his bosses.

1051
00:43:32,275 --> 00:43:32,975
Like, this thing failed.

1052
00:43:32,995 --> 00:43:33,435
What'd you do?

1053
00:43:33,695 --> 00:43:36,056
Well, I wanted to let them go their own way.

1054
00:43:36,476 --> 00:43:38,737
And oh my god, they're going to get fired.

1055
00:43:39,157 --> 00:43:39,737
It's really bad.

1056
00:43:40,217 --> 00:43:42,578
And then we have this last quadrant that we see quite a

1057
00:43:42,698 --> 00:43:47,220
lot, projects where it failed and there was a lot of meddling

1058
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:48,860
from the publisher.

1059
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:49,640
And then what do they say?

1060
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:51,301
I did all I could.

1061
00:43:52,122 --> 00:43:53,263
I couldn't have possibly done more.

1062
00:43:53,303 --> 00:43:54,584
I was in there every day.

1063
00:43:55,504 --> 00:43:57,926
I was in there for two hours every day talking to the team,

1064
00:43:57,946 --> 00:43:58,746
and they still failed.

1065
00:43:59,006 --> 00:43:59,287
I don't know.

1066
00:43:59,307 --> 00:44:01,748
I gave them so much direction, and I micromanaged all the hell

1067
00:44:01,788 --> 00:44:02,568
out of it, and it still failed.

1068
00:44:02,889 --> 00:44:03,689
What more could I have done?

1069
00:44:03,709 --> 00:44:04,189
I don't know.

1070
00:44:04,209 --> 00:44:04,890
So like.

1071
00:44:07,188 --> 00:44:09,109
It's easy to joke about this and stuff, but you can kind of

1072
00:44:09,189 --> 00:44:11,650
understand that there are incentives to kind of get in

1073
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:14,031
there and kind of be involved in the communication, which

1074
00:44:14,071 --> 00:44:15,712
makes it super important, if you're working with a

1075
00:44:15,732 --> 00:44:18,173
publisher, if you're working with a client, to design the

1076
00:44:18,213 --> 00:44:20,633
information flow so that they have what they need, so that

1077
00:44:20,653 --> 00:44:22,614
they feel confident, so they feel like they're doing the

1078
00:44:22,654 --> 00:44:25,675
best they can to make it really excellent.

1079
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:28,652
Okay, other things that block information flow.

1080
00:44:29,013 --> 00:44:29,673
Mental ruts.

1081
00:44:30,234 --> 00:44:31,876
I've always been doing this the same way,

1082
00:44:32,457 --> 00:44:34,379
and I don't really want to change it,

1083
00:44:34,919 --> 00:44:37,983
and so I'm gonna ignore this new information.

1084
00:44:38,964 --> 00:44:39,505
Secrets.

1085
00:44:39,985 --> 00:44:40,746
Shh, don't tell anybody.

1086
00:44:40,766 --> 00:44:41,968
You can't tell anybody this.

1087
00:44:43,209 --> 00:44:46,333
That's what secret is, an information flow blocker.

1088
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,400
and then fear all man

1089
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:54,041
fear there's so many kinds of fear in the office all man they're all over the

1090
00:44:54,081 --> 00:44:54,721
place right

1091
00:44:55,021 --> 00:44:57,482
people never do and fears the mind killer yes

1092
00:44:58,182 --> 00:45:00,922
all right so many times all my god that the boss of the really

1093
00:45:01,223 --> 00:45:04,063
mad if i if he finds out about this to keep it a secret

1094
00:45:04,503 --> 00:45:06,384
also his feelings of the hurt if you tell her

1095
00:45:06,684 --> 00:45:07,124
how much

1096
00:45:07,444 --> 00:45:07,884
her art

1097
00:45:08,224 --> 00:45:08,784
socks

1098
00:45:09,224 --> 00:45:10,424
rights of don't don't tell her that

1099
00:45:10,805 --> 00:45:14,105
if i if i tell people i really feel about this project of a laugh at me

1100
00:45:15,543 --> 00:45:17,884
Man, I might make a mistake and everyone would find out.

1101
00:45:18,364 --> 00:45:19,105
Oh, don't tell the client.

1102
00:45:19,125 --> 00:45:20,786
They'll be so disappointed if they find out.

1103
00:45:20,826 --> 00:45:22,927
Just keep it quiet and hope it gets better.

1104
00:45:24,027 --> 00:45:27,129
Man, I could lose respect to the team if I tell them.

1105
00:45:27,912 --> 00:45:30,854
you know, I really blew this and I don't want people to know, so I'll keep that a secret.

1106
00:45:31,254 --> 00:45:33,295
And then the one in everybody's heart.

1107
00:45:33,915 --> 00:45:37,737
Everyone will know that I'm a fraud if I tell them how I really feel about this.

1108
00:45:38,117 --> 00:45:42,100
Okay, so that's fear is an information blocker and you've got to be aware of it in yourself,

1109
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,540
you've got to be aware of it in other people,

1110
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:48,243
and you've got to find ways to reduce that fear so that it's okay to share the truth.

1111
00:45:48,675 --> 00:45:51,216
You want to create opportunities for the truth

1112
00:45:51,276 --> 00:45:51,836
to go through.

1113
00:45:52,276 --> 00:45:53,497
I've found as my studio's gotten bigger,

1114
00:45:53,517 --> 00:45:56,578
it's been super hard for me, because truth to power

1115
00:45:56,698 --> 00:45:57,959
is really, really hard.

1116
00:45:58,299 --> 00:46:00,220
The bigger you are and the higher you are up the ladder,

1117
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,860
the less people want to tell you the truth,

1118
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:04,281
because they're scared of getting fired,

1119
00:46:04,321 --> 00:46:05,882
or you being mad, or whatever.

1120
00:46:06,162 --> 00:46:07,823
So you have to work really hard to find ways

1121
00:46:08,103 --> 00:46:09,423
to make sure people are comfortable

1122
00:46:09,724 --> 00:46:10,884
and getting the information out.

1123
00:46:12,725 --> 00:46:15,886
So related to this, fascinating research

1124
00:46:16,426 --> 00:46:18,147
by Casciaro and Lobo here.

1125
00:46:18,699 --> 00:46:24,222
Okay, they're looking at what makes people succeed in companies.

1126
00:46:24,362 --> 00:46:26,784
Okay, so here's the thing we often think about.

1127
00:46:27,505 --> 00:46:30,427
The relationship about competence, we all know about that.

1128
00:46:30,467 --> 00:46:32,208
We all know about some people are good at what they do.

1129
00:46:32,308 --> 00:46:33,349
Some people are bad at what they do.

1130
00:46:33,909 --> 00:46:37,191
Then they were looking at the question of how important is likability in the office?

1131
00:46:37,792 --> 00:46:39,673
Because we all know people who are really great at what they

1132
00:46:39,693 --> 00:46:41,894
do, but everybody hates them.

1133
00:46:42,354 --> 00:46:44,035
So where do you want to be on this chart?

1134
00:46:44,335 --> 00:46:46,477
Obviously, you want to be up here.

1135
00:46:46,617 --> 00:46:47,577
You're highly competent.

1136
00:46:47,697 --> 00:46:48,438
Everybody likes you.

1137
00:46:48,718 --> 00:46:49,798
Everybody wants to hire that guy.

1138
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:51,299
That's obviously where you want to be.

1139
00:46:51,519 --> 00:46:52,440
Where don't you want to be?

1140
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:53,581
Down here at the bottom.

1141
00:46:53,941 --> 00:46:55,702
Incompetent jerk.

1142
00:46:56,222 --> 00:46:58,624
Guy sucks at what he does, and what a jerk.

1143
00:46:58,664 --> 00:47:00,044
Oh my god, I can't stand him.

1144
00:47:01,005 --> 00:47:01,805
That's obvious.

1145
00:47:02,266 --> 00:47:03,346
These guys didn't study that.

1146
00:47:03,446 --> 00:47:05,748
These guys studied the other two boxes.

1147
00:47:07,053 --> 00:47:07,213
Hmm.

1148
00:47:07,633 --> 00:47:09,975
So the question they asked was, hey, managers,

1149
00:47:10,455 --> 00:47:12,096
if you had to hire one of the other two boxes,

1150
00:47:12,937 --> 00:47:14,118
who would you hire?

1151
00:47:14,598 --> 00:47:18,240
Would you hire the competent jerk, great at what they do,

1152
00:47:18,861 --> 00:47:21,262
I want to wring his neck every single day, hate that guy?

1153
00:47:22,223 --> 00:47:24,405
Or would you hire the lovable fool?

1154
00:47:25,405 --> 00:47:25,665
Right?

1155
00:47:26,106 --> 00:47:28,587
Not very good at what they do, pretty bad at what they do,

1156
00:47:28,827 --> 00:47:30,529
but everybody loves that guy.

1157
00:47:30,769 --> 00:47:32,990
Everybody, oh, it's fun to have around, so nice,

1158
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:33,771
everybody likes him.

1159
00:47:34,031 --> 00:47:35,632
I feel really comfortable around them.

1160
00:47:36,513 --> 00:47:38,716
They found that generally, managers, if you ask them,

1161
00:47:38,736 --> 00:47:39,476
who would you hire?

1162
00:47:39,977 --> 00:47:41,879
They'd say, well, given that choice,

1163
00:47:41,919 --> 00:47:43,000
I'd hire the competent jerk.

1164
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:46,163
Because he might be a jerk, but he'll get the job done.

1165
00:47:47,104 --> 00:47:48,826
But if you ask people, hey, who do you want to work with?

1166
00:47:49,667 --> 00:47:51,508
People would say, if I had to make that choice,

1167
00:47:51,669 --> 00:47:52,750
I'd pick the lovable fool.

1168
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:54,652
Because yeah, they're not great at what they do,

1169
00:47:54,672 --> 00:47:56,153
but at least they're not going to screw everything up

1170
00:47:56,173 --> 00:47:56,834
for everybody else.

1171
00:47:57,474 --> 00:47:59,096
At least they'll do very little damage.

1172
00:48:00,134 --> 00:48:01,475
So that's interesting.

1173
00:48:02,275 --> 00:48:04,836
Then they looked at, OK, let's do a profile of a bunch of

1174
00:48:04,876 --> 00:48:06,997
companies and figure out which side they favored.

1175
00:48:07,037 --> 00:48:08,937
Do they favor competent jerks or lovable fools?

1176
00:48:09,577 --> 00:48:13,539
And then given that, how does that relate to the success of

1177
00:48:13,559 --> 00:48:13,999
the company?

1178
00:48:14,819 --> 00:48:18,981
And they found that successful companies favored the lovable

1179
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:19,321
fool.

1180
00:48:20,461 --> 00:48:21,322
Now that's really weird.

1181
00:48:21,922 --> 00:48:24,263
Successful companies favored incompetence.

1182
00:48:26,232 --> 00:48:32,116
right? It's weird to think about. So they thought, this is really strange. Why is this

1183
00:48:32,857 --> 00:48:36,479
the case? And what they found was, the...

1184
00:48:37,695 --> 00:48:39,056
Competent jerks we know are a problem.

1185
00:48:39,376 --> 00:48:40,297
Because yeah, they're good at what they do,

1186
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:41,698
but they wreck everything for everything else.

1187
00:48:41,718 --> 00:48:43,679
They block information for lots of people.

1188
00:48:43,959 --> 00:48:44,780
They keep secrets.

1189
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:47,021
They make other people want to keep secrets.

1190
00:48:47,302 --> 00:48:48,122
You always hear people say,

1191
00:48:48,422 --> 00:48:49,643
oh man, I hate big companies.

1192
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:50,364
So much politics.

1193
00:48:50,404 --> 00:48:51,124
There's politics.

1194
00:48:51,284 --> 00:48:52,345
What does politics mean?

1195
00:48:52,966 --> 00:48:54,026
What politics means is,

1196
00:48:54,046 --> 00:48:56,888
I have something that I want to tell somebody,

1197
00:48:57,409 --> 00:48:58,550
and I feel like I can't,

1198
00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:00,591
so I tell somebody else.

1199
00:49:01,832 --> 00:49:02,132
That's it.

1200
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,541
That's all politics is.

1201
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:06,303
Anytime that happens in your organization, you have politics.

1202
00:49:06,563 --> 00:49:07,684
If you can remove that,

1203
00:49:08,265 --> 00:49:11,307
then you have no politics in your organization.

1204
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:13,609
Jerks make for a lot of politics.

1205
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:16,472
Now, on the other side, this lovable fool character,

1206
00:49:16,892 --> 00:49:18,734
like, they don't mess things up.

1207
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:20,095
Everybody likes having them around.

1208
00:49:20,335 --> 00:49:21,376
They might not be good at what they do.

1209
00:49:21,656 --> 00:49:22,437
And here's the thing.

1210
00:49:23,398 --> 00:49:24,258
Somebody's got a problem.

1211
00:49:24,338 --> 00:49:25,579
They're all pissed off about something.

1212
00:49:25,639 --> 00:49:26,420
Oh, man, that Benson.

1213
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:27,141
God, I hate that guy.

1214
00:49:27,281 --> 00:49:27,921
Who are they going to tell?

1215
00:49:28,985 --> 00:49:31,447
The lovable fool is like super likable.

1216
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:33,468
People you like, you tell them stuff.

1217
00:49:33,528 --> 00:49:34,249
You can trust them.

1218
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:37,111
And you're like, man, that Benz guy, he's pissed me off so much.

1219
00:49:37,431 --> 00:49:37,791
And guess what?

1220
00:49:37,811 --> 00:49:38,852
This person's got a lot of time.

1221
00:49:42,314 --> 00:49:42,514
Right?

1222
00:49:44,584 --> 00:49:49,066
And part of what makes them so likable is they care about what's going on.

1223
00:49:49,086 --> 00:49:49,987
They're like, oh, really?

1224
00:49:50,007 --> 00:49:51,107
What's up with Benson?

1225
00:49:51,487 --> 00:49:52,328
Oh, man, he's in this meeting.

1226
00:49:52,368 --> 00:49:52,868
He said this.

1227
00:49:53,308 --> 00:49:54,208
Oh, geez, that's terrible.

1228
00:49:54,248 --> 00:49:54,769
I'm so sorry.

1229
00:49:54,789 --> 00:49:55,649
I'm sorry that happened.

1230
00:49:55,889 --> 00:49:56,750
And then it bothers them.

1231
00:49:56,790 --> 00:49:57,310
And then they go.

1232
00:49:57,350 --> 00:49:58,750
And they try and work it out a little bit.

1233
00:49:59,511 --> 00:50:00,631
They might go and talk to Benson.

1234
00:50:00,911 --> 00:50:03,272
Dude, do you know what people are saying about you?

1235
00:50:06,074 --> 00:50:09,515
Or maybe they'll go talk to Benson's boss and say, man, a lot of people are really unhappy

1236
00:50:09,955 --> 00:50:10,436
with this guy.

1237
00:50:10,456 --> 00:50:11,456
I'm not trying to be a jerk.

1238
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:17,144
And what happens is all this blocked up emotional information flows through them

1239
00:50:17,464 --> 00:50:20,546
and gets to where it needs to be and makes everything better.

1240
00:50:21,107 --> 00:50:22,308
And you know what happens over time?

1241
00:50:23,469 --> 00:50:25,510
Because everybody likes the lovable fool and they're always helping him,

1242
00:50:25,991 --> 00:50:27,612
they often get better and better and better,

1243
00:50:28,012 --> 00:50:29,734
and they move up to the lovable star category

1244
00:50:30,154 --> 00:50:31,475
because people get better at what they do.

1245
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:34,758
The competent jerk, is he going to get more likable over time?

1246
00:50:34,798 --> 00:50:35,218
No way.

1247
00:50:35,984 --> 00:50:37,325
No way, that doesn't happen.

1248
00:50:37,685 --> 00:50:39,667
So talking about jerks, I found this interesting book,

1249
00:50:39,707 --> 00:50:40,887
Never Check Email in the Morning,

1250
00:50:41,188 --> 00:50:42,409
some interesting business advice,

1251
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:44,330
but it had this statement that blew me away.

1252
00:50:44,370 --> 00:50:46,091
There are exactly six kinds of jerks.

1253
00:50:46,411 --> 00:50:50,414
I'm like, no way, I could name 150 right now, right?

1254
00:50:52,055 --> 00:50:53,796
But I went through their list and I went through my list

1255
00:50:53,856 --> 00:50:56,558
and I'm like, goddamn, if they hadn't had all my 150 jerks

1256
00:50:56,598 --> 00:50:57,919
like sorted into six categories.

1257
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:01,551
And the thing that blew my mind was, of these six kinds of

1258
00:51:01,571 --> 00:51:04,952
jerks, of these six kind of jerks, they were all

1259
00:51:05,032 --> 00:51:06,573
information blockers in different ways.

1260
00:51:07,173 --> 00:51:08,953
The inaccessible jerk.

1261
00:51:09,353 --> 00:51:10,574
Oh, I can never get a meeting with that guy.

1262
00:51:10,614 --> 00:51:11,474
He has what I need.

1263
00:51:11,854 --> 00:51:13,735
And I just, oh, I can never get through to this guy.

1264
00:51:13,755 --> 00:51:14,775
He doesn't answer his emails.

1265
00:51:14,875 --> 00:51:15,775
Damn it, that guy.

1266
00:51:16,676 --> 00:51:17,296
Unreliable.

1267
00:51:17,316 --> 00:51:18,796
When are you going to have that done?

1268
00:51:18,816 --> 00:51:19,997
Oh, I'll have it done.

1269
00:51:20,297 --> 00:51:21,017
I don't know, Wednesday.

1270
00:51:21,137 --> 00:51:21,777
Near Wednesday.

1271
00:51:21,957 --> 00:51:22,497
Hey, is it done?

1272
00:51:23,258 --> 00:51:25,078
Oh, no, no, no, sorry.

1273
00:51:25,318 --> 00:51:25,978
Sorry, it's just not.

1274
00:51:26,198 --> 00:51:27,719
Oh, you're killing you because they're unreliable.

1275
00:51:29,107 --> 00:51:29,868
Someone who's too rigid.

1276
00:51:30,348 --> 00:51:31,870
They're like, nope, this is the only way I do it.

1277
00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:34,832
You're like, but Bill, it's killing the project, man.

1278
00:51:34,932 --> 00:51:35,533
It's killing it.

1279
00:51:36,033 --> 00:51:37,394
And they're ignoring information.

1280
00:51:38,395 --> 00:51:40,337
Someone who's disrespectful.

1281
00:51:40,717 --> 00:51:42,639
You're worried they're going to spread bad information about

1282
00:51:42,699 --> 00:51:43,780
you, about other people.

1283
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,541
And you're worried things are going to get

1284
00:51:45,561 --> 00:51:46,462
twisted and noised up.

1285
00:51:47,723 --> 00:51:48,344
Vagueness.

1286
00:51:49,368 --> 00:51:50,229
You know, when's that going to be done?

1287
00:51:50,249 --> 00:51:52,130
I don't know, when it's kind of done.

1288
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:54,230
Oh, that's not even information.

1289
00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:56,011
Like, you're pretending it is and it's not.

1290
00:51:56,731 --> 00:51:58,332
And then the unfair jerk.

1291
00:51:58,632 --> 00:52:01,453
You're worried, man, this guy doesn't treat people fairly.

1292
00:52:01,613 --> 00:52:03,314
If I tell him the truth, he's going to use it against me.

1293
00:52:03,614 --> 00:52:05,755
I've got to block it and keep it secret.

1294
00:52:06,215 --> 00:52:07,516
Anyway, so that's interesting to think about.

1295
00:52:07,956 --> 00:52:09,076
So looking at this.

1296
00:52:09,897 --> 00:52:12,559
Remember, our facts, opinions, and emotions about projects,

1297
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:13,479
processes, and people.

1298
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:15,161
So we have an org chart.

1299
00:52:15,201 --> 00:52:16,081
That's one of our tools.

1300
00:52:16,382 --> 00:52:17,322
And what does that tool do?

1301
00:52:17,562 --> 00:52:21,285
It manages facts and opinions about processes and people.

1302
00:52:21,806 --> 00:52:22,426
OK, makes sense.

1303
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:24,387
And then we have our project hierarchy,

1304
00:52:24,888 --> 00:52:27,670
like how we manage individual projects.

1305
00:52:28,010 --> 00:52:30,972
That's about facts and opinions about projects.

1306
00:52:31,593 --> 00:52:34,035
That covers things pretty well, except emotions

1307
00:52:34,155 --> 00:52:35,015
are left out in the cold.

1308
00:52:35,536 --> 00:52:36,576
And if you look at the

1309
00:52:37,728 --> 00:52:40,729
The Castellaro and Lobo research, they use this phrase

1310
00:52:40,989 --> 00:52:41,969
affective hubs.

1311
00:52:42,389 --> 00:52:45,650
That means people you like who spread useful information

1312
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:46,630
through the studio.

1313
00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:49,231
In other words, they're like the emotional router for your

1314
00:52:49,251 --> 00:52:49,911
studio, right?

1315
00:52:50,692 --> 00:52:52,752
These people are really important because what they do

1316
00:52:53,132 --> 00:52:55,613
is they route emotional information, some of the most

1317
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:58,474
important information, about projects, processes, and

1318
00:52:58,554 --> 00:52:58,794
people.

1319
00:52:59,314 --> 00:53:02,716
If you manage not just one org chart, but three of these,

1320
00:53:02,836 --> 00:53:04,357
and you consciously think about these,

1321
00:53:04,457 --> 00:53:07,139
it makes a giant difference in your studio.

1322
00:53:07,479 --> 00:53:10,501
I once had a team that was having a lot of problems.

1323
00:53:10,621 --> 00:53:13,303
And I realized, man, it's not that they're like a skill.

1324
00:53:13,383 --> 00:53:14,384
People are a little rigid.

1325
00:53:14,404 --> 00:53:16,025
They weren't always great communicators.

1326
00:53:16,925 --> 00:53:20,107
And a resume crossed my desk for somebody

1327
00:53:20,187 --> 00:53:22,949
who was very inexperienced, but like.

1328
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:24,591
It was super likable.

1329
00:53:24,671 --> 00:53:26,033
Someone had a reference.

1330
00:53:26,293 --> 00:53:26,954
And I'm like, you know what?

1331
00:53:26,974 --> 00:53:27,614
Let's try that.

1332
00:53:27,995 --> 00:53:28,696
Everything changed.

1333
00:53:28,896 --> 00:53:30,998
This person with very little skill comes on the team, but

1334
00:53:31,038 --> 00:53:33,181
all of a sudden, all the bad toxins came out of the team,

1335
00:53:33,481 --> 00:53:34,182
and everything got better.

1336
00:53:35,203 --> 00:53:36,825
OK, a few more final tips here.

1337
00:53:36,845 --> 00:53:40,509
I love this book, The Advantage, by Patrick Lencioni.

1338
00:53:42,235 --> 00:53:44,657
His argument is that your biggest advantage in business

1339
00:53:44,797 --> 00:53:46,338
is a healthy organization.

1340
00:53:46,439 --> 00:53:47,339
And what does healthy mean?

1341
00:53:47,579 --> 00:53:49,081
He's basically saying an organization

1342
00:53:49,101 --> 00:53:50,422
with healthy information flow.

1343
00:53:50,482 --> 00:53:53,024
And he gives a lot of tips for how to make that happen.

1344
00:53:53,484 --> 00:53:56,246
Some of his best ones are, if you're running a studio,

1345
00:53:56,286 --> 00:53:58,588
you have to decide what is important.

1346
00:54:00,598 --> 00:54:04,121
let people know about it and not just let them know you need to over communicate it

1347
00:54:04,382 --> 00:54:06,163
i love the phrase over communicate

1348
00:54:06,183 --> 00:54:10,528
because uh... it just means i'm gonna tell you a lot of times more than is

1349
00:54:10,568 --> 00:54:13,871
necessary because i tell you more than is necessary improves the chance it's

1350
00:54:13,891 --> 00:54:14,511
gonna get through

1351
00:54:14,972 --> 00:54:16,253
we don't like to repeat ourselves

1352
00:54:16,974 --> 00:54:19,216
uh... we don't like to repeat ourselves we don't

1353
00:54:19,636 --> 00:54:20,257
like to be ourselves

1354
00:54:22,718 --> 00:54:25,420
But things that are important should be over communicated.

1355
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:27,161
Things like a mission statement.

1356
00:54:27,261 --> 00:54:28,702
Oh man, that's so corporate and bad.

1357
00:54:28,942 --> 00:54:29,542
No, it's not.

1358
00:54:30,022 --> 00:54:33,264
It is the reason you are doing what you are doing.

1359
00:54:33,965 --> 00:54:36,026
If you don't know what it is, then what are you doing?

1360
00:54:36,066 --> 00:54:37,307
You're just wandering around.

1361
00:54:37,827 --> 00:54:40,448
And if you haven't figured it out and clearly communicated

1362
00:54:40,488 --> 00:54:42,850
it, no one else really knows what you guys are doing,

1363
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:43,130
either.

1364
00:54:43,830 --> 00:54:45,511
Because this is a weird thing to say.

1365
00:54:45,792 --> 00:54:47,032
People don't just want a job.

1366
00:54:47,793 --> 00:54:48,933
People want a religion.

1367
00:54:49,985 --> 00:54:53,591
right? They want to come to work and be like, damn, what I'm doing is important.

1368
00:54:53,751 --> 00:54:57,497
It is important and I know why. And if you run a studio,

1369
00:54:57,578 --> 00:55:01,845
it is your job to make people know and feel that and understand about that.

1370
00:55:02,529 --> 00:55:04,630
Now, there's lots of other ways of over-communicating things, too.

1371
00:55:05,350 --> 00:55:07,530
Steve Jobs was very famous for this, right?

1372
00:55:08,371 --> 00:55:09,811
How did Steve feel about the new prototype?

1373
00:55:09,991 --> 00:55:10,791
Everyone knew.

1374
00:55:11,371 --> 00:55:13,952
It was no secret how Steve felt, right?

1375
00:55:14,172 --> 00:55:15,672
And he wanted things to be excellent.

1376
00:55:16,173 --> 00:55:18,393
And he wasn't like, oh, yeah, this is excellent.

1377
00:55:18,853 --> 00:55:19,713
This is really bad.

1378
00:55:20,054 --> 00:55:21,054
This is kind of in the middle.

1379
00:55:21,294 --> 00:55:22,174
Nope.

1380
00:55:22,914 --> 00:55:24,855
In order to communicate that, only excellent

1381
00:55:24,895 --> 00:55:26,995
was acceptable in his vocabulary.

1382
00:55:28,881 --> 00:55:33,442
When he would evaluate your work, it was either excellent and amazing or it was total shit.

1383
00:55:33,922 --> 00:55:36,303
Right? Now, I thought about that a lot when I read that.

1384
00:55:36,323 --> 00:55:39,924
I'm like, man, am I really going to run around the studio telling everybody whose work is kind

1385
00:55:39,944 --> 00:55:41,725
of at the B plus level that it's total shit?

1386
00:55:42,425 --> 00:55:45,606
No, I'm not going to do that because that's just nasty and rude.

1387
00:55:45,766 --> 00:55:47,307
Right? I just, I can't live that way.

1388
00:55:47,347 --> 00:55:48,847
There's too much bad news.

1389
00:55:49,227 --> 00:55:50,428
But there is a word you can use.

1390
00:55:50,468 --> 00:55:54,549
And so I will give you my very, very useful magic word, unacceptable.

1391
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:55,390
Right?

1392
00:55:56,341 --> 00:55:59,184
Unacceptable is an objective word that is very, very clear.

1393
00:55:59,804 --> 00:56:02,247
I see what you're doing, and it has its benefits.

1394
00:56:02,627 --> 00:56:03,948
But man, this thing has to be perfect.

1395
00:56:03,988 --> 00:56:05,550
So currently, this is not acceptable.

1396
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:06,470
This is unacceptable.

1397
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:07,531
We need to get this better.

1398
00:56:08,112 --> 00:56:09,653
You can talk about that in a very clear way.

1399
00:56:10,995 --> 00:56:12,836
Another tip, an excellent book.

1400
00:56:13,197 --> 00:56:16,900
Anybody who has a brain and a mouth or ears

1401
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:18,181
should read this book.

1402
00:56:20,133 --> 00:56:22,975
It's all about how to deal with difficult conversations.

1403
00:56:23,115 --> 00:56:25,397
Because difficult conversations are massive information

1404
00:56:25,417 --> 00:56:25,777
blockers.

1405
00:56:26,278 --> 00:56:27,839
There's awkward things that you want to say,

1406
00:56:27,859 --> 00:56:28,780
but you don't want to say.

1407
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:31,221
This book is all about how to do it.

1408
00:56:31,502 --> 00:56:35,064
And the key is that it's listening.

1409
00:56:35,345 --> 00:56:37,346
There's something you're really pissed at a guy about.

1410
00:56:39,448 --> 00:56:41,109
And the key is not to go in and say,

1411
00:56:41,129 --> 00:56:42,710
I'm going to tell you this and this and this and this.

1412
00:56:43,071 --> 00:56:47,214
The key is to say, listen, I feel this way about it.

1413
00:56:49,175 --> 00:56:49,255
And.

1414
00:56:49,635 --> 00:56:51,016
and I want to understand your point of view.

1415
00:56:51,276 --> 00:56:53,298
And then get as much listening as possible.

1416
00:56:53,358 --> 00:56:55,821
And they give a ton of good tips in there.

1417
00:56:56,181 --> 00:56:58,063
And if you want to practice listening, oh, my God,

1418
00:56:58,083 --> 00:56:59,585
there's this website, 7CupsOfTea.

1419
00:57:00,486 --> 00:57:01,647
Here's the idea of 7CupsOfTea.

1420
00:57:01,667 --> 00:57:03,689
The internet is full of people who

1421
00:57:04,189 --> 00:57:05,430
are full of strife and trouble.

1422
00:57:06,351 --> 00:57:09,194
And they can go here, and trained listeners will just

1423
00:57:09,274 --> 00:57:10,135
listen to their problems.

1424
00:57:10,937 --> 00:57:11,917
and talk with them about it.

1425
00:57:11,957 --> 00:57:12,638
They don't give advice.

1426
00:57:13,018 --> 00:57:13,518
They listen.

1427
00:57:14,158 --> 00:57:17,219
And you can go on there and take a 10-minute video training

1428
00:57:17,239 --> 00:57:18,459
course about how to become a listener,

1429
00:57:18,479 --> 00:57:19,599
and you can start doing it today.

1430
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:22,000
And oh my god, it totally works.

1431
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:23,000
It's crazy.

1432
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,760
It's crazy how this little 10-minute video can make you

1433
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:26,681
into a much better listener.

1434
00:57:28,461 --> 00:57:30,841
OK, so wrapping up, here's one other book

1435
00:57:30,881 --> 00:57:31,862
some people may have heard of.

1436
00:57:32,962 --> 00:57:35,402
Matthew 7-7, Seek and Ye Shall Find.

1437
00:57:36,303 --> 00:57:37,483
People always say, oh my god, you

1438
00:57:37,503 --> 00:57:38,803
can't get a studio past a certain point.

1439
00:57:38,823 --> 00:57:39,763
We're going to hit these problems.

1440
00:57:41,027 --> 00:57:43,747
The thing that is true, any problem that you have

1441
00:57:43,807 --> 00:57:46,047
organizational in your studio, if you want to solve it

1442
00:57:46,288 --> 00:57:48,688
and you're focused on solving it, you can solve it.

1443
00:57:48,948 --> 00:57:49,988
They're all solvable.

1444
00:57:50,348 --> 00:57:52,549
There are organizations that have 10,000, 100,000 people.

1445
00:57:52,669 --> 00:57:53,989
These problems are solvable.

1446
00:57:54,409 --> 00:57:56,009
But if you say, I'm not going to worry about this.

1447
00:57:56,049 --> 00:57:57,650
I'll let it take care of itself, that's

1448
00:57:57,670 --> 00:57:58,350
when you get in trouble.

1449
00:57:58,730 --> 00:58:00,790
But if you look for the solutions, you will find them.

1450
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:01,910
But you do have to look for them.

1451
00:58:02,610 --> 00:58:05,171
OK, so studios with good information flow, they say,

1452
00:58:05,191 --> 00:58:06,651
I know how to structure management.

1453
00:58:06,771 --> 00:58:07,991
I know how to manage my project.

1454
00:58:09,484 --> 00:58:11,925
We know I don't have miscommunications with clients

1455
00:58:11,945 --> 00:58:13,226
because we have the right information flow.

1456
00:58:13,606 --> 00:58:14,806
We have the right meetings.

1457
00:58:15,027 --> 00:58:16,687
Those meetings we have are good and useful.

1458
00:58:17,668 --> 00:58:19,388
Our team has good morale because everybody feels good

1459
00:58:19,408 --> 00:58:19,989
about what they're doing.

1460
00:58:20,449 --> 00:58:22,230
Our game is on time, yes.

1461
00:58:22,690 --> 00:58:24,711
And our game rocks, yes.

1462
00:58:24,911 --> 00:58:26,091
Those are all things that you want.

1463
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:31,834
So I'll close up with this quote I love from John Lurie here.

1464
00:58:32,859 --> 00:58:33,799
He's a Zen master.

1465
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:36,200
If the energy is really flowing freely,

1466
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:38,621
the brush paints by itself, the camera photographs,

1467
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:41,962
the sculpture forms, the words write, the dance dances.

1468
00:58:42,523 --> 00:58:45,163
The creator of the art, the subject of the art,

1469
00:58:45,504 --> 00:58:48,505
and the expression itself merge into a single process

1470
00:58:48,805 --> 00:58:51,266
in which there is no reflection or evaluation,

1471
00:58:51,626 --> 00:58:54,227
just the art manifesting itself.

1472
00:58:54,707 --> 00:58:56,567
When you have solid information flow,

1473
00:58:56,627 --> 00:58:59,288
that's what the creative process feels like in a group.

1474
00:59:00,209 --> 00:59:00,729
Thanks very much.
