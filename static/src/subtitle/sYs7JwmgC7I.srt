00:00:11,532 --> 00:00:16,537
Hi everyone, I'm Hunter Bokele and I'm here to talk to you about a bunch of trees, charity

2
00:00:16,577 --> 00:00:22,343
features and what we've done on one of our games at Tilting Point in how to help the

3
00:00:22,363 --> 00:00:25,866
planet overall and integrating features into your game with profit neutrality.

4
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:31,783
So what we did last year was we integrated a feature into TerraGenesis, one of our games,

5
00:00:32,123 --> 00:00:36,145
which plants trees based on certain player actions completed in the game.

6
00:00:36,705 --> 00:00:41,768
And over the course of the past year we've planted about 500,000 trees in Mozambique,

7
00:00:41,868 --> 00:00:43,709
Madagascar, and a few other countries.

8
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:50,251
What I want to talk to you guys about is how to leverage basic free to play techniques

9
00:00:50,952 --> 00:00:57,393
to benefit some sort of actual real world cause with profit neutrality so it actually

10
00:00:57,914 --> 00:01:03,095
doesn't cost you anything, most of the cost is passed on to the player and your CEOs and

11
00:01:03,135 --> 00:01:06,096
finance team don't come down and say shut down the project, it's costing us way too

12
00:01:06,116 --> 00:01:06,416
much money.

13
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:13,059
And the basic steps in order to do that are figuring out how you choose your partner and

14
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:17,203
the cause that you're actually going after, what you actually need to consider when building

15
00:01:17,263 --> 00:01:23,109
out a social impact feature as opposed to building a normal feature, and then how do

16
00:01:23,129 --> 00:01:27,433
you actually communicate this with your players, which is a little bit different than you do

17
00:01:27,533 --> 00:01:28,393
with normal features.

18
00:01:31,284 --> 00:01:34,047
So the first up, the cause and the partner.

19
00:01:34,847 --> 00:01:37,290
So the important thing to remember about this feature

20
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,212
is it doesn't matter what you want to do here.

21
00:01:39,592 --> 00:01:41,193
You are not the one spending the money,

22
00:01:41,314 --> 00:01:43,416
spending the time in actually benefiting the world.

23
00:01:43,616 --> 00:01:44,196
It's your players.

24
00:01:44,717 --> 00:01:47,439
And so the main focus needs to be on what cause

25
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:49,161
your players actually care about,

26
00:01:50,102 --> 00:01:51,723
rather than something that you want to support

27
00:01:51,763 --> 00:01:52,884
because it's good for the planet.

28
00:01:53,605 --> 00:01:55,507
And so you got to figure out

29
00:01:55,667 --> 00:01:57,028
what do your players actually care about.

30
00:01:58,048 --> 00:02:00,890
And so easiest way to do that is just ask your players.

31
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,150
Fairly simple.

32
00:02:03,191 --> 00:02:05,953
Just run a survey, in-game survey,

33
00:02:06,413 --> 00:02:08,034
generate it out to a survey monkey,

34
00:02:08,554 --> 00:02:10,295
run it a poll on social pages,

35
00:02:10,315 --> 00:02:11,436
a lot of different ways there,

36
00:02:11,836 --> 00:02:13,737
but you can just directly ask them,

37
00:02:14,017 --> 00:02:15,338
list out a whole bunch of different causes.

38
00:02:16,155 --> 00:02:19,277
The other way, one way that we went as well, is thematically.

39
00:02:19,317 --> 00:02:21,239
You already know your players care about your game

40
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:22,881
because they're playing your game.

41
00:02:22,961 --> 00:02:23,701
They downloaded it.

42
00:02:23,741 --> 00:02:25,503
They care about whatever the theme of your game is.

43
00:02:26,043 --> 00:02:29,206
And so you can tie a cause that matches the theme of your game.

44
00:02:29,806 --> 00:02:31,668
For example, Terra Genesis, it's a game

45
00:02:31,688 --> 00:02:35,651
about taking a barren planet into this lush garden,

46
00:02:36,092 --> 00:02:37,793
beautiful, human-supporting planet.

47
00:02:38,654 --> 00:02:40,656
That fits really well with reforestation,

48
00:02:40,796 --> 00:02:43,418
which is all about planting trees across a planet.

49
00:02:44,324 --> 00:02:50,506
And in one of our games, SpongeBob Krusty Cook-Off, it's a game based on a kid's IP and

50
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:51,207
it's a cooking game.

51
00:02:51,507 --> 00:02:58,549
It made a lot of sense for us to partner with a children's food app, a food company that

52
00:02:58,629 --> 00:02:59,330
benefits children.

53
00:03:01,461 --> 00:03:05,825
So once you actually have your cause, you need to actually find a partner, because you're

54
00:03:05,845 --> 00:03:06,466
a gaming company.

55
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:07,507
I know this is shocking.

56
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:11,771
But you are not an expert in actually benefiting the world.

57
00:03:12,351 --> 00:03:14,734
We make money from a bunch of people downloading our apps.

58
00:03:15,675 --> 00:03:20,419
You are not equipped to deal with government regulations, permits, advocacy groups, mass

59
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:21,340
producing food.

60
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,901
I've never worked in a kitchen in my life.

61
00:03:23,894 --> 00:03:29,916
You need to find a partner that sole job is leveraging capital towards a specific end

62
00:03:30,616 --> 00:03:35,018
and who actually can do that and take that burden off of you.

63
00:03:35,358 --> 00:03:39,099
You're the capital source, they're the actual integration and the benefit to the world.

64
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:43,420
And the other thing you need to keep in mind is this is your player's money.

65
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,161
This is not your money, this is not your time.

66
00:03:46,001 --> 00:03:49,022
You need to make sure that it's going to the right place because your players are trusting

67
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:49,422
you with it.

68
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:57,121
And unfortunately there are a lot of not the best charities out there or who don't maximize

69
00:03:57,161 --> 00:03:57,702
the impact.

70
00:03:58,242 --> 00:04:03,627
And so you need to go through the charities and figure out what's the best bang for your

71
00:04:03,647 --> 00:04:03,847
buck.

72
00:04:04,568 --> 00:04:08,412
Make sure that it's not the money that your players are giving you isn't getting spent

73
00:04:08,732 --> 00:04:13,596
on government regulations, government corruption, or getting skimmed off by unfortunately the

74
00:04:13,636 --> 00:04:16,359
charities themselves to maximize their own bottom line.

75
00:04:17,196 --> 00:04:21,758
So you want to make sure there's a very clear line between your player's money and integration

76
00:04:21,938 --> 00:04:22,958
and benefiting the world.

77
00:04:24,239 --> 00:04:27,700
The other way to think about it is you're going to have to be working with these people

78
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,342
on a day-to-day basis or month-to-month basis.

79
00:04:30,442 --> 00:04:35,064
You need a very clear line of communication and very clear established steps of how you're

80
00:04:35,104 --> 00:04:37,224
actually going to be working together like you would with any partner.

81
00:04:37,965 --> 00:04:42,568
So the classic way to do this is basically the player spends some money in the game,

82
00:04:43,068 --> 00:04:48,952
spends some time in the game, something to that effect, and every week, month, quarter, year,

83
00:04:49,052 --> 00:04:55,116
you go through, you run a query and collect all the data and see, okay, this many players

84
00:04:55,156 --> 00:05:00,540
completed these actions, this is the trees that I need to plant, then sending the order over to

85
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:05,603
your partner, and then they send it over to their partners and integrate it and actually

86
00:05:06,384 --> 00:05:07,445
get the benefit out in the world.

87
00:05:08,496 --> 00:05:12,640
Other ways, because there are some more tech savvy charities out there, is that basically

88
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:18,244
the player completes some action, the charity has an actual API and sends it directly to

89
00:05:18,264 --> 00:05:21,707
the API, which will send it directly to the charity, who will then put it into the game.

90
00:05:22,168 --> 00:05:23,449
Super easy and clean.

91
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:29,614
Depending on how you want to work, how long-term this part of the relationship is, and what

92
00:05:29,654 --> 00:05:30,495
your goals are, really.

93
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,781
So we partnered with a company called Ecology,

94
00:05:34,941 --> 00:05:35,882
which you should all check out

95
00:05:35,942 --> 00:05:36,923
because it's a fabulous company.

96
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:41,866
And functionally, why we decided to go with them,

97
00:05:41,946 --> 00:05:43,327
they're a subscription service

98
00:05:43,667 --> 00:05:45,588
that's mostly targeting non-businesses,

99
00:05:45,648 --> 00:05:47,589
although we're one of their first business clients.

100
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,011
And they plant a certain number of trees

101
00:05:50,131 --> 00:05:51,592
for a subscription per month.

102
00:05:52,012 --> 00:05:53,994
We basically partnered with them

103
00:05:54,094 --> 00:05:55,374
for a more direct relationship.

104
00:05:55,975 --> 00:05:59,237
Reason we did this was because they maximize their impact

105
00:05:59,337 --> 00:06:01,498
at every single level of the partnership.

106
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,921
So first of all, down to the trees they select.

107
00:06:04,081 --> 00:06:07,823
They plant mangroves, which absorb a very large amount

108
00:06:07,843 --> 00:06:11,945
of carbon emissions once mature, which takes about 8 to 10 years.

109
00:06:12,925 --> 00:06:16,807
They, mangroves specifically, are unlikely to be impacted

110
00:06:16,887 --> 00:06:19,988
by wildfires or natural disasters because they're

111
00:06:20,008 --> 00:06:22,429
on the coastline, in the wetlands, not going to catch

112
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:23,690
on fire, it's very unlikely.

113
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,551
And they're also very deep root systems,

114
00:06:26,571 --> 00:06:27,592
so it's deep into the soil.

115
00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:31,090
And on top of that, beyond the actual carbon benefits,

116
00:06:31,611 --> 00:06:34,493
they create habitats for local fisheries,

117
00:06:34,913 --> 00:06:36,294
which benefits the local economy.

118
00:06:36,795 --> 00:06:39,196
They reinforce the actual sediment on the beaches

119
00:06:39,917 --> 00:06:43,359
and protect the coastline from natural disasters,

120
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:46,742
tidal waves, tsunamis, so on, from erosion over time.

121
00:06:47,382 --> 00:06:50,244
And Ecology works very closely with local communities

122
00:06:50,645 --> 00:06:52,366
to ensure that the charries are not just

123
00:06:52,386 --> 00:06:53,227
gonna get chopped down.

124
00:06:53,327 --> 00:06:54,888
Because the last thing we want is our players

125
00:06:55,168 --> 00:06:56,229
trust us, we have a bunch of money.

126
00:06:56,809 --> 00:07:00,650
And then the trees just get chopped down, so we have to plant more trees and rinse and

127
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,010
repeat and it benefits no one.

128
00:07:03,451 --> 00:07:08,212
On top of that, they're also very transparent, so unlike some charities, we're not guessing

129
00:07:08,272 --> 00:07:10,112
as to what Impact's actually doing.

130
00:07:10,592 --> 00:07:14,453
We can go through on these spreadsheets that are available to everyone online in their

131
00:07:14,553 --> 00:07:19,794
FAQs and see every tree that's planted, all of their minutes to their board meetings,

132
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:25,295
all the carbon offset initiatives, and even the total amount of revenue that they've generated

133
00:07:25,335 --> 00:07:25,775
for the past year.

134
00:07:26,225 --> 00:07:32,811
several years. So it's completely transparent on every step of the process. And then finally,

135
00:07:32,831 --> 00:07:37,956
I like that they have an API. It means that there's less manual work on our end in order

136
00:07:37,996 --> 00:07:44,222
to actually ensure that there's a link between our players and the service. It creates a

137
00:07:44,242 --> 00:07:47,805
very direct relationship between our players as they do an action in game, they can go

138
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:49,206
online and immediately see it.

139
00:07:50,367 --> 00:07:55,670
taking place in ecology. So functionally how the integration works for us is our player

140
00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:01,832
completes some sort of action or monetizes in game. We do some checks via our anti cheat

141
00:08:01,872 --> 00:08:07,194
system that we set up through lean plum and then send it over to the ecology API which

142
00:08:07,234 --> 00:08:11,476
sends it directly to ecology and within a day everything is starting to get planted.

143
00:08:13,417 --> 00:08:17,239
So okay. We have our cause. We have our partner. We know what we want to do and who we want

144
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:17,679
to do it with.

145
00:08:18,913 --> 00:08:19,914
What are we actually doing?

146
00:08:19,934 --> 00:08:20,914
That's kind of an important thing.

147
00:08:22,214 --> 00:08:25,055
So when we're doing any feature, especially on this scale,

148
00:08:25,075 --> 00:08:26,535
there are sort of two decisions to make.

149
00:08:27,195 --> 00:08:28,355
First of all is how are you going to do it,

150
00:08:28,395 --> 00:08:31,776
and second of all is how long are you going to do it for?

151
00:08:31,796 --> 00:08:33,796
So we're going to tackle the time one first.

152
00:08:34,276 --> 00:08:35,876
You can either do this on a permanent basis,

153
00:08:35,936 --> 00:08:38,097
which is a lengthier undertaking,

154
00:08:38,137 --> 00:08:39,937
which is re-theming your entire game

155
00:08:40,357 --> 00:08:41,857
to a degree towards this,

156
00:08:42,018 --> 00:08:43,858
which is what we chose to do on Terragenesis,

157
00:08:44,678 --> 00:08:46,978
or you can do this as a limited time event.

158
00:08:47,599 --> 00:08:52,926
And so something that's a little bit lower cost that you do on a short-term basis.

159
00:08:53,887 --> 00:08:56,751
So limited time event, what are you going to think about here?

160
00:08:57,412 --> 00:09:01,197
Well, you're not going to make an entire new feature just for this limited time event just

161
00:09:01,218 --> 00:09:01,959
to benefit the world.

162
00:09:02,059 --> 00:09:03,681
That's a lot of cost, a lot of energy.

163
00:09:04,128 --> 00:09:08,291
be engineers, art resources, reworking your entire content pipeline.

164
00:09:08,751 --> 00:09:11,333
So what you instead want to do is, what do you have already?

165
00:09:11,793 --> 00:09:17,398
You have to utilize your existing live operations infrastructure to build this feature out.

166
00:09:17,938 --> 00:09:19,319
So how do you run the normal events?

167
00:09:19,619 --> 00:09:23,282
Can you, if you're a match tree game, is there a side mode that you run periodically?

168
00:09:23,682 --> 00:09:25,764
Can you just make that every player who completes that?

169
00:09:26,184 --> 00:09:27,005
We plant a tree for you.

170
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:31,822
That's very simple and easy to do. That doesn't require huge effort to you other than just some

171
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:38,787
communication to the player. Can you repurpose existing features? So examples of that, Brawl

172
00:09:38,827 --> 00:09:46,293
Stars from Supercell for example, back in 2020 they introduced a Koala Nita skin which was meant

173
00:09:46,313 --> 00:09:52,538
to help the Australian wildfires. So 85% of the revenue generated from this skin was sent to the

174
00:09:52,718 --> 00:09:56,902
Australian government. And that's a really easy form because it's

175
00:09:57,362 --> 00:10:01,105
works within their content pipeline, they're making skins all the time, just requires art

176
00:10:01,145 --> 00:10:08,150
resources and overall doesn't cost them anything other than the resources to develop it. And

177
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:13,895
a new one, mostly just a game that I love playing, is Horizon Forbidden West. So Sony

178
00:10:13,975 --> 00:10:18,678
did a promotion which is for the first month of the game's release, anyone who completes

179
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:24,002
the tutorial will plant a tree for you. And it's another very easy thing for you to do

180
00:10:24,062 --> 00:10:26,624
which is just set a goal in the game and say, if.

181
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,908
Number of players who complete this, we will plant a tree.

182
00:10:30,409 --> 00:10:33,116
And you can communicate it again in just messaging around the game.

183
00:10:34,757 --> 00:10:39,380
Now if you want to go the more complicated route, which I love doing and I propose, you

184
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,041
want to follow basically it's a permanent feature in your game.

185
00:10:42,301 --> 00:10:46,343
You want to follow the exact same procedure that you would for any permanent feature in

186
00:10:46,383 --> 00:10:50,345
your game, which is what need does this actually fulfill for my player?

187
00:10:50,385 --> 00:10:54,067
Why does my player care about it beyond the fact that we're doing good for the world?

188
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,588
How does it fit within the player loop?

189
00:10:56,828 --> 00:10:58,849
What are we doing to direct the player towards it?

190
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:02,151
And what KPIs is this actually going to uplift?

191
00:11:02,515 --> 00:11:05,477
aside from planting trees, which can be a KPI.

192
00:11:06,617 --> 00:11:09,119
So what we did in TerraGenesis is we identified

193
00:11:09,739 --> 00:11:12,060
for a long time now that we don't have many

194
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,942
progression points beyond completing levels.

195
00:11:15,102 --> 00:11:16,903
And so we wanted to introduce a more permanent

196
00:11:16,923 --> 00:11:18,143
progression system as well.

197
00:11:18,563 --> 00:11:20,785
And we've done this in various ways throughout the years.

198
00:11:21,325 --> 00:11:23,446
In addition, we wanted to add an additional currency

199
00:11:24,006 --> 00:11:26,407
that we can use to give out in bundles

200
00:11:26,487 --> 00:11:28,408
and as rewards beyond our hard currency.

201
00:11:29,061 --> 00:11:31,082
So those are the two player needs that we had,

202
00:11:31,222 --> 00:11:32,643
to make bundles more interesting

203
00:11:33,283 --> 00:11:35,304
and to provide long-term progression.

204
00:11:35,744 --> 00:11:37,985
So we came up with the My Forest feature.

205
00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:41,006
And so basically what it is, is it's a forest.

206
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:42,407
Very obviously.

207
00:11:42,427 --> 00:11:46,629
It is a bunch of rows of trees that the player plants

208
00:11:46,929 --> 00:11:49,610
and you can see very visually the actual impact

209
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:50,770
that you're having on the world

210
00:11:51,431 --> 00:11:54,052
and see it grow over time as you progress through the game.

211
00:11:54,812 --> 00:11:57,453
They plant trees for acquiring carbon impact currency.

212
00:11:58,038 --> 00:12:00,620
so we'll get into the exact sources of those later on.

213
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,421
And then once you have enough currency,

214
00:12:03,861 --> 00:12:07,643
you plant the tree, the API sends the call out to Ecology

215
00:12:07,723 --> 00:12:09,344
who will then plant the tree in the real world.

216
00:12:10,304 --> 00:12:13,646
And on top of that, we reinforce it through rewards.

217
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:16,307
So every four trees the player plants,

218
00:12:16,687 --> 00:12:18,788
we give you a very small in-game reward.

219
00:12:18,848 --> 00:12:20,969
That's just a few hard currency, maybe a character.

220
00:12:21,592 --> 00:12:26,555
to sweeten the deal as it were for the player and give them an actual reason beyond altruistically

221
00:12:26,595 --> 00:12:32,399
helping the planet. And we also do some fun animation stuff which is we change the background

222
00:12:32,599 --> 00:12:38,903
so here you can see destroyed, awful, climate disaster planet. And then when you've planted

223
00:12:38,983 --> 00:12:43,626
one tree, snow goes away, sky becomes a little bit clearer, buildings are a little bit less

224
00:12:43,646 --> 00:12:48,009
destroyed. Plant a second tree, again, or ten trees.

225
00:12:48,694 --> 00:12:51,155
and cleaner atmosphere, more trees,

226
00:12:51,315 --> 00:12:52,415
buildings get a little bit rougher,

227
00:12:52,435 --> 00:12:56,496
then we get to blue skies, little bit greener grass,

228
00:12:57,096 --> 00:12:58,237
when we get to 80 trees,

229
00:12:58,717 --> 00:13:00,918
and then finally we get to this beautiful metropolis

230
00:13:01,358 --> 00:13:03,338
when you've planted around 250 trees

231
00:13:03,778 --> 00:13:06,499
with clear skies and sort of pushing towards the future.

232
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,120
So again, we reinforce this through visuals

233
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,040
for the player as well.

234
00:13:12,001 --> 00:13:13,981
So, okay, we've talked about the duration.

235
00:13:15,062 --> 00:13:17,062
How do we actually make sure that this is profit neutral?

236
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,380
So that our CEOs and finance team don't come down on us and say, guys, why are we spending

237
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,741
hundreds of thousands of dollars benefiting the planet which is not helping our bottom

238
00:13:24,761 --> 00:13:26,261
line, go turn it off.

239
00:13:27,622 --> 00:13:29,782
Which is a conversation I would very much like to avoid.

240
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:32,263
So there are two ways to do that.

241
00:13:32,943 --> 00:13:34,303
One of which is more direct than the other.

242
00:13:34,983 --> 00:13:37,744
First of all is you can just make it very one-to-one.

243
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:38,964
Your player spends $1.

244
00:13:39,004 --> 00:13:40,024
We spend $1 on planting trees.

245
00:13:40,604 --> 00:13:40,924
Very simple.

246
00:13:44,778 --> 00:13:49,681
You can do that either via IAPs or ads because then other people are paying.

247
00:13:50,742 --> 00:13:52,503
You can tie it to a certain percentage.

248
00:13:52,563 --> 00:13:53,944
You can make a specific bundle.

249
00:13:54,365 --> 00:13:55,986
There's a lot of customizability there.

250
00:13:56,446 --> 00:14:00,970
And the benefits of this strategy is it's very easy to not cost you any money.

251
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:04,232
It's very clear the exact mitigation points are.

252
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:10,507
The only risk really is that it might cannibalize your existing IAPs in some areas or your

253
00:14:10,547 --> 00:14:14,969
existing ad placements. So you're going to need to do a lot of A-B testing. We did about

254
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:20,373
three months of A-B testing for this feature. Yeah, something like that. To get everything

255
00:14:20,533 --> 00:14:23,275
just right to where it's not actually costing us money.

256
00:14:25,047 --> 00:14:30,071
Then the engagement is the trickier route which is you want to tie it to milestones

257
00:14:30,211 --> 00:14:31,432
or events in the game.

258
00:14:32,012 --> 00:14:37,236
So you can do an achievement system where if the player reaches level 20 you plant a

259
00:14:37,256 --> 00:14:38,057
tree in the real world.

260
00:14:38,417 --> 00:14:39,798
Level 40, so on.

261
00:14:40,239 --> 00:14:42,480
You could do a limited time event as we saw earlier.

262
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:48,765
in the match free example. There are a few different ways to do that. Instead of motivating

263
00:14:48,785 --> 00:14:53,487
the player to progress via in game rewards, you're providing a higher motivation for playing

264
00:14:53,507 --> 00:14:58,809
the game which is benefiting the world and being a good person. It's a little bit more

265
00:14:58,889 --> 00:15:03,711
difficult here to tie in the direct monetization aspect because it's not direct.

266
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,363
So what you're going for really is a retention play,

267
00:15:07,543 --> 00:15:10,125
which will hopefully extend your LTV

268
00:15:10,185 --> 00:15:12,267
by keeping users around for longer periods.

269
00:15:12,987 --> 00:15:15,930
Or you tie it in directly to difficult events,

270
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:19,293
which will monetize because they are difficult,

271
00:15:20,413 --> 00:15:22,355
which you already know are monetizing because of that.

272
00:15:23,476 --> 00:15:24,897
So there is a little bit more of a risk there

273
00:15:24,917 --> 00:15:26,398
that you're gonna have to be very careful with,

274
00:15:26,819 --> 00:15:28,961
but if carefully managed, you should be successful.

275
00:15:30,482 --> 00:15:31,843
So what do we actually do in TerraGenesis?

276
00:15:31,883 --> 00:15:33,424
Where are you getting this carbon impact currency?

277
00:15:34,157 --> 00:15:36,917
So you're gonna get it from their specific IAPs,

278
00:15:37,397 --> 00:15:38,518
specific bundles in the game,

279
00:15:38,578 --> 00:15:40,378
which give away only that currency.

280
00:15:40,818 --> 00:15:42,218
So this is for the true altruists

281
00:15:42,938 --> 00:15:44,599
that really just want to plant trees.

282
00:15:45,439 --> 00:15:47,880
Then we also give it a very small portion away

283
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,640
in our hard currency packs as well.

284
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,621
So maybe one to five per pack,

285
00:15:53,821 --> 00:15:54,821
which is a very small amount,

286
00:15:55,301 --> 00:15:58,162
to sort of have an added bonus to our existing IAPs.

287
00:15:59,102 --> 00:16:00,582
Then we have an ad placement,

288
00:16:00,802 --> 00:16:03,103
which will give away a certain amount of the currency.

289
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,402
We balance this based on the ECPM of the ad placement

290
00:16:07,483 --> 00:16:11,525
because different countries have different ECPMs on average.

291
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:15,147
So for example, US will give away more of the currency

292
00:16:15,287 --> 00:16:18,409
than in Brazil because US ads are more valuable to us.

293
00:16:18,449 --> 00:16:20,470
I mean, the goal is profit neutrality.

294
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:23,611
And then finally, in our difficult limited time events,

295
00:16:24,252 --> 00:16:27,694
we give it away in end milestones of those as well

296
00:16:28,294 --> 00:16:29,595
so that the user has to complete

297
00:16:29,615 --> 00:16:31,296
the very difficult monetizing end event

298
00:16:31,716 --> 00:16:32,716
to get the currency.

299
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:39,522
Okay. We've talked about the cause, partner, feature, we're all ready to go. How do we

300
00:16:39,562 --> 00:16:43,643
actually make sure that the player understands this is what it does, we're actually benefiting

301
00:16:43,663 --> 00:16:49,286
the world, we are good people? Because they have a lot on their mind. We are asking a lot of our

302
00:16:49,306 --> 00:16:53,768
players all the time. And trying to pull their direction and their attention in a dozen

303
00:16:53,788 --> 00:16:57,230
different directions, they're getting push notifications from other games to go play

304
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,891
those, they're trying to get messages from their friends who are like, why are you playing

305
00:17:00,931 --> 00:17:02,492
games? Come help us and hang out.

306
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:08,337
How do we make sure that they not only understand this feature, but that this isn't just a feature

307
00:17:08,357 --> 00:17:10,761
in the game, it's actually benefiting the world.

308
00:17:11,662 --> 00:17:13,565
And that's a difficult little proposition to make.

309
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:18,413
The simplest version, these are some quick tips.

310
00:17:19,282 --> 00:17:23,083
You need to tutorialize it as you would with any feature, walk the player through what

311
00:17:23,123 --> 00:17:28,045
it actually is, how detailed and direct the tutorial you want to do is up to you and what

312
00:17:28,085 --> 00:17:29,566
works best in your UX flow.

313
00:17:30,246 --> 00:17:34,868
You're probably going to want to reinforce it with notification badges, call to actions

314
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:38,970
to drag the player's attention back to it periodically to make sure that they don't

315
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:39,971
forget it completely.

316
00:17:41,171 --> 00:17:46,156
And the only real odd thing here is you're going to want to get your players out of your

317
00:17:46,236 --> 00:17:46,376
app.

318
00:17:46,736 --> 00:17:50,740
I know we spend most of our time trying to keep our players in our apps and keep them

319
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:51,620
engaged with us.

320
00:17:52,301 --> 00:17:55,964
You need to direct them to the website of the charity that you're partnering with so

321
00:17:56,004 --> 00:17:59,787
that they actually have a very clear connection between your game and the charity.

322
00:18:01,249 --> 00:18:02,930
And get them out there and to understand it.

323
00:18:04,231 --> 00:18:08,055
It's a little bit more difficult and different than you would in a normal game.

324
00:18:08,813 --> 00:18:12,555
And then on top of that, you're going to want to leverage all of your social media channels

325
00:18:12,575 --> 00:18:17,399
to be also engaging them on the community and social side as well to reach your most

326
00:18:17,459 --> 00:18:18,179
engaged players.

327
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:23,062
And in all of this communication at every step in the process, you need to repeat and

328
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:26,285
repeat and repeat and repeat that this is a real world thing.

329
00:18:27,025 --> 00:18:31,848
When we plant trees in TerraGenesis, we're not just doing a cool little side feature

330
00:18:31,888 --> 00:18:32,629
where you plant trees.

331
00:18:33,129 --> 00:18:38,253
You're actually planting real world trees here, not just a side animation.

332
00:18:39,377 --> 00:18:40,717
So how do we do that in Terra Genesis?

333
00:18:41,197 --> 00:18:44,418
Well, the top little screenshot is a pop-up

334
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,199
that we show pretty early on in the game.

335
00:18:46,719 --> 00:18:50,141
So we give away about 15 carbon impact points

336
00:18:50,781 --> 00:18:53,422
at the start of the game, just for installing the game.

337
00:18:54,022 --> 00:18:56,683
Then about three to five sessions in,

338
00:18:57,183 --> 00:18:59,704
we explain, here is what carbon impact points are

339
00:18:59,744 --> 00:19:01,185
after you've learned the basics of the game.

340
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:05,801
And here's what carbon impact points are, here's where you earn them, here's the fact

341
00:19:05,841 --> 00:19:12,084
that we're partnered with this ecology service, here's photos of the tree planting actually

342
00:19:12,104 --> 00:19:17,866
in process and it's realistic, actual real life photos, not matching the animation in

343
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:22,548
the game itself to further emphasize that this is something outside the game in the

344
00:19:22,588 --> 00:19:23,028
real world.

345
00:19:24,669 --> 00:19:29,433
and then once you've actually acquired 30 hardware and impact points and are ready to

346
00:19:29,453 --> 00:19:33,777
plant your first tree, then it will walk you through a more detailed tutorial of taking

347
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:37,860
you through here's where you plant the tree, here's the animation that plays, here's the

348
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,924
real world impact part, and then we have a little tool tip if you forget any of that

349
00:19:41,964 --> 00:19:42,464
stuff because...

350
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,667
Players forget or rapidly tap through things and don't read.

351
00:19:46,887 --> 00:19:48,208
That breaks it all down again.

352
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:52,048
And then we also have a button on the top left,

353
00:19:52,188 --> 00:19:53,529
which is the global stats button,

354
00:19:53,569 --> 00:19:56,469
which takes you directly to our ecology website,

355
00:19:56,849 --> 00:19:58,410
where you can see all the trees planted

356
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:01,210
by all of the TerraGenesis players over all time,

357
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:03,491
which is about 540,000 so far.

358
00:20:04,551 --> 00:20:06,372
And it also doubles as a referral link.

359
00:20:06,692 --> 00:20:09,012
So we get extra trees if you sign up based on that.

360
00:20:09,052 --> 00:20:10,832
So everyone should go in and sign up

361
00:20:10,872 --> 00:20:12,013
based on our referral link.

362
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:18,712
And then beyond the actual in-game stuff, we emphasize it on our social pages.

363
00:20:19,353 --> 00:20:23,614
So we did a big promotion on our social pages when we first introduced the feature, then

364
00:20:23,654 --> 00:20:29,557
we give the players regular updates on how many trees they are planting throughout the

365
00:20:29,597 --> 00:20:30,257
various stages.

366
00:20:30,677 --> 00:20:35,439
We use memes, because memes are fabulous, on actually educating the player on how the

367
00:20:35,479 --> 00:20:37,880
feature works and engaging them with it.

368
00:20:38,868 --> 00:20:44,550
And then my community, I love my community manager, had the genius idea of the treater

369
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:47,932
board which is a leader board of trees.

370
00:20:48,452 --> 00:20:51,253
We run a competition with our community every month or so.

371
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:56,314
It's a week long and it's a competition for who can plant the most trees in a given week.

372
00:20:57,295 --> 00:20:58,095
And it's a lot of fun.

373
00:20:58,155 --> 00:20:59,135
We call it the treater board.

374
00:20:59,155 --> 00:21:04,117
It's a great way to engage your community and get them to really rally behind the feature.

375
00:21:05,858 --> 00:21:06,098
Okay.

376
00:21:07,028 --> 00:21:09,069
So we've gotten our feature, we've gotten all that right.

377
00:21:10,429 --> 00:21:16,211
Did we as TerraGenesis actually succeed in this whole idea of profit neutrality and leveraging

378
00:21:16,251 --> 00:21:17,291
our audience for social good?

379
00:21:18,931 --> 00:21:23,272
Well we planted a lot of trees at the very least, which I'm very proud of, even if we

380
00:21:23,292 --> 00:21:26,213
did massively fail in any other aspect, which we didn't.

381
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:30,034
Just having planted a huge number of trees, it took us...

382
00:21:30,704 --> 00:21:35,788
six months to plant 500,000 trees or so. We slowed down towards the end as players adopted

383
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:38,450
and were like, oh, okay, this is cool. We saw a large adoption at the beginning and

384
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:43,414
then petered out a little bit over time. But, yeah, that's an awesome achievement that I

385
00:21:43,454 --> 00:21:46,536
think and I'm really proud of the team for the whole feature.

386
00:21:48,197 --> 00:21:53,041
But did it, again, actually gain us anything? Or did it actually hurt us in the overall

387
00:21:53,281 --> 00:21:58,305
picture? So on the left you can see the pre-ecology stats, on the right you can see the post-ecology

388
00:21:58,345 --> 00:21:58,645
stats.

389
00:22:00,841 --> 00:22:05,002
The overall speech on the left side there is the IAP.

390
00:22:05,262 --> 00:22:08,882
And you can see that's only about a two to 4% increase.

391
00:22:08,962 --> 00:22:10,203
It really isn't a huge amount.

392
00:22:10,603 --> 00:22:13,023
Not many people are actually breaking out their wallets

393
00:22:13,063 --> 00:22:14,723
and spending large sums of money.

394
00:22:15,784 --> 00:22:19,384
On the ad side, however, we saw about a 10 to 15% uplift

395
00:22:19,864 --> 00:22:23,745
based on ad engagement and ads watch per DAU

396
00:22:24,185 --> 00:22:26,446
without cannibalizing our existing placement.

397
00:22:26,506 --> 00:22:28,346
So it performed as an additive bonus.

398
00:22:30,358 --> 00:22:31,800
That's pretty awesome.

399
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:35,183
So, my theory here, now I have only gotten to test this in TerraGenesis,

400
00:22:35,223 --> 00:22:37,966
so I haven't gotten to see more hardcore games.

401
00:22:38,266 --> 00:22:41,609
We make about 50% of our money in ads, 50% of our money in IAP,

402
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:45,693
so I want to test this in a more hardcore game that's more IAP-driven.

403
00:22:46,574 --> 00:22:52,340
But my theory is that people are more likely to spend their time than money on given charity

404
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:52,760
features.

405
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:56,845
You're more likely to sign a petition that costs you maybe five minutes to sign up for

406
00:22:56,865 --> 00:23:00,648
a petition to go bug the government and have someone else do something than you are to

407
00:23:00,749 --> 00:23:02,570
actually spend your money on something.

408
00:23:03,231 --> 00:23:06,154
And so that's something that I want to test in other games.

409
00:23:06,194 --> 00:23:08,476
So if anyone ever does anything like this, let me know.

410
00:23:10,785 --> 00:23:13,066
But did we achieve net neutral profitability?

411
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:15,187
Well, to see that, we need to run through the math.

412
00:23:15,907 --> 00:23:19,690
So on average, our users planned about one tree

413
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,370
per two users, a little bit more.

414
00:23:22,051 --> 00:23:24,252
And it costs us $0.18 per tree.

415
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:26,893
So overall, the cost per install is $0.10.

416
00:23:27,914 --> 00:23:30,235
So we can break it down on the right there.

417
00:23:30,295 --> 00:23:32,056
We see the LTV.

418
00:23:32,236 --> 00:23:35,518
That was an uplift just based on our ecology ad placements.

419
00:23:36,138 --> 00:23:37,019
That's up to about $0.09 or so.

420
00:23:39,158 --> 00:23:42,519
And then on the IAP side, again, it's about two cents.

421
00:23:42,579 --> 00:23:44,579
So fairly small on the IAP side.

422
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,460
But it gives us a one cent install margin.

423
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,721
That's profiting and that we mostly have for,

424
00:23:52,842 --> 00:23:53,442
what's it called?

425
00:23:54,682 --> 00:23:56,643
Supporting the engineers who integrated the feature

426
00:23:57,223 --> 00:23:59,204
and our own maintenance costs for making sure

427
00:23:59,244 --> 00:24:00,964
that the whole feature runs smoothly

428
00:24:01,404 --> 00:24:02,805
and the community support for it.

429
00:24:03,285 --> 00:24:05,165
So it's not really profit.

430
00:24:05,805 --> 00:24:06,606
So we did it, yay!

431
00:24:09,701 --> 00:24:14,063
So what we've talked about is, yeah, we've managed to integrate a feature that benefits

432
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:18,464
the overall world, doesn't cost us money, my CEO is not going to come and tell me to

433
00:24:18,504 --> 00:24:20,224
turn it off any time soon that I know of.

434
00:24:21,964 --> 00:24:23,185
Yeah, it's pretty fantastic.

435
00:24:23,425 --> 00:24:29,746
And so what I want you guys to leave here this presentation with is how to think about

436
00:24:29,786 --> 00:24:32,807
it on your end and how to integrate these sorts of things as well.

437
00:24:33,482 --> 00:24:36,083
to think about what the cause is.

438
00:24:36,203 --> 00:24:37,603
Needs to be what your players care about,

439
00:24:37,683 --> 00:24:38,664
not what you care about.

440
00:24:39,504 --> 00:24:41,385
And you find that out via the survey

441
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:44,046
or tying it to the theme of your game.

442
00:24:44,886 --> 00:24:47,027
And then finding a partner that will work

443
00:24:47,087 --> 00:24:49,749
as a good custodian for your players' money and time.

444
00:24:50,389 --> 00:24:52,350
Because again, this is about your players' money,

445
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:53,010
not your money.

446
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:57,012
And making sure that this feature is profit neutral

447
00:24:57,112 --> 00:24:59,693
so that you can do it over a prolonged period of time.

448
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:04,217
that's either deciding to do it on a limited time basis

449
00:25:04,658 --> 00:25:05,519
or a permanent basis,

450
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,604
and either making it to a monetizing feature

451
00:25:09,065 --> 00:25:12,991
or going purely for long-term LTV growth through retention.

452
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:17,813
And then finally just repeatedly messaging it to your player, bashing them over the head

453
00:25:17,873 --> 00:25:21,595
with the fact that they are actually doing something good for the world, not just having

454
00:25:21,655 --> 00:25:24,197
fun in a game, although they are doing that as well.

455
00:25:25,118 --> 00:25:31,022
And if you do all that, you end up with doing a lot of good for the planet and benefiting

456
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:34,424
not just your players who feel like they're doing a great time, your team because you

457
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:37,987
are super motivated because you are doing something good for the world, not just lining

458
00:25:38,007 --> 00:25:41,289
your own pockets, and the world as a whole.

459
00:25:43,633 --> 00:25:47,055
If you do want to do something that's not profit neutral, go for it. I'm not going to stop you.

460
00:25:48,997 --> 00:25:52,619
Cool. That's it. I'm done. Anyone have... Thank you. Thank you.

461
00:25:55,801 --> 00:25:59,043
There are some mics here or you can shout really loudly if anyone has any questions.

462
00:26:01,425 --> 00:26:07,008
Hi. Great talk. Thanks for sharing your experience with the tree planting project.

463
00:26:07,088 --> 00:26:07,609
No problem.

464
00:26:07,869 --> 00:26:08,770
Very excited about that.

465
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:11,311
Could you maybe talk about...

466
00:26:12,434 --> 00:26:17,018
Maybe the quantified carbon emissions that are embedded in that number of trees planted,

467
00:26:17,078 --> 00:26:19,840
was that part of what ecology does?

468
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,641
Do they measure that?

469
00:26:21,241 --> 00:26:28,168
And I guess, does that tree planting cover the emissions of players themselves?

470
00:26:29,945 --> 00:26:34,228
Okay, so making sure that we're actually covering the emissions of the phones that are actually

471
00:26:34,628 --> 00:26:35,989
playing the game and generating this.

472
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:40,392
So it's, the reason I didn't talk a huge amount about specific carbon emissions is there's

473
00:26:40,412 --> 00:26:43,875
a lot of different stats in a lot of different areas, so that's why I emphasized the reforestation

474
00:26:43,915 --> 00:26:44,275
part of it.

475
00:26:45,696 --> 00:26:50,420
It's hard to measure the exact amount of carbon emissions played by the game, it's something

476
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,801
I'm working on right now actually.

477
00:26:52,572 --> 00:26:53,773
over the course of the next few weeks.

478
00:26:53,813 --> 00:26:55,354
I'm trying to go in and see, okay,

479
00:26:55,374 --> 00:26:56,956
this is exactly how much time is being played.

480
00:26:56,976 --> 00:26:59,297
This is how much the battery life would cost and so on.

481
00:27:00,478 --> 00:27:05,462
Overall, we do try and emphasize the, I think one tree,

482
00:27:06,562 --> 00:27:08,724
I'm trying to remember the stats off the top of my head.

483
00:27:09,224 --> 00:27:13,908
It's some like 30,000 units of carbon emissions,

484
00:27:14,428 --> 00:27:15,929
but it takes a little bit of time for them

485
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:17,430
to reach maturity, which is the problem.

486
00:27:18,231 --> 00:27:20,953
Of course, one tree will end up planting five trees.

487
00:27:21,469 --> 00:27:22,530
because they spawn ad extras.

488
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:24,732
So I don't think it ultimately adds out to be neutral,

489
00:27:24,792 --> 00:27:26,433
but that is something that you need to think about.

490
00:27:32,418 --> 00:27:33,619
Hello, thank you for the talk.

491
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,582
So my question is about the part

492
00:27:36,642 --> 00:27:39,364
where you ask players to survey.

493
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:42,587
So does that, I guess that means that it's something

494
00:27:42,607 --> 00:27:46,010
that you need to bake into your game to make it make sense?

495
00:27:47,721 --> 00:27:55,066
I'm going to see if I can rephrase this question more clearly.

496
00:27:57,187 --> 00:28:04,813
What if you can't think of a gameplay mechanic to match the thing that you found in the survey

497
00:28:04,853 --> 00:28:08,055
that your players want to give charity to?

498
00:28:08,867 --> 00:28:15,655
So in terms of how the survey works is you run an interstitial in the game that basically

499
00:28:15,675 --> 00:28:18,058
says, hey, guys, we know you were playing the game.

500
00:28:18,099 --> 00:28:19,200
We appreciate you playing the game.

501
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,522
Thanks so much.

502
00:28:21,062 --> 00:28:25,788
Can you answer us a few simple questions to help us make your game experience better?

503
00:28:25,868 --> 00:28:27,290
The same way you'd run a lot of different surveys.

504
00:28:27,744 --> 00:28:32,774
You either do that via an interstitial or you can throw it into an in-app message in

505
00:28:32,814 --> 00:28:35,059
an inbox if your game supports inboxes.

506
00:28:36,001 --> 00:28:39,327
You can see this a lot in Genshin Impact, it's constantly asking me to fill out surveys.

507
00:28:40,987 --> 00:28:43,069
Yeah, so that's how you do the survey side of things.

508
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:46,492
And you list out, you can do pre-listed options

509
00:28:46,552 --> 00:28:49,534
of the causes, or you can leave an other section

510
00:28:49,554 --> 00:28:52,216
as well at the end to let them write in their own cause.

511
00:28:53,077 --> 00:28:55,619
In terms of, let me remember,

512
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:57,940
if you don't have a gameplay mechanic

513
00:28:58,001 --> 00:29:02,984
that matches the cause you want to support,

514
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:07,752
It depends how much you want to tie things together and what your game is.

515
00:29:08,033 --> 00:29:10,514
So you could just do an IAP.

516
00:29:10,974 --> 00:29:16,197
For example, Brawl Stars doesn't have any in-game mechanics really that support or that

517
00:29:16,237 --> 00:29:18,899
relate to wildfires, too directly at least.

518
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:25,223
However, they have a skin that they can re-theme to be related to the Australian wildfires

519
00:29:25,343 --> 00:29:26,884
or Australian-themed.

520
00:29:28,164 --> 00:29:30,845
And they can use that to tie the player's mind to,

521
00:29:31,205 --> 00:29:32,786
okay, this looks, this is a koala.

522
00:29:32,826 --> 00:29:33,906
Koalas are from Australia.

523
00:29:34,326 --> 00:29:36,227
It's supporting Australian wildfires.

524
00:29:36,707 --> 00:29:37,807
So it's a clear connection.

525
00:29:39,088 --> 00:29:40,308
Yeah, so that's what you do.

526
00:29:40,328 --> 00:29:42,889
You find sort of creative ways to work around the issue

527
00:29:43,329 --> 00:29:47,010
if you don't wanna do a full gameplay aspect of it.

528
00:29:54,031 --> 00:29:58,539
First of all, just congratulations, half a million trees. That's really amazing.

529
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:04,269
I was intrigued by your comment about the non-monetary actions that...

530
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:08,432
Perhaps we could incentivize players to participate in it.

531
00:30:08,452 --> 00:30:13,634
And just off the top of my head, I'm thinking, like, flash mob protests, you know, plant

532
00:30:13,674 --> 00:30:16,836
a tree yourself, clean up a river, take pictures.

533
00:30:17,616 --> 00:30:21,918
But then I'm thinking that adds so much more, you know, verification and all that.

534
00:30:21,958 --> 00:30:24,220
So I was just hoping you could speak a little bit more about that.

535
00:30:25,197 --> 00:30:31,341
Yeah, so the non-monetising aspects are a little bit more difficult. We saw some increase

536
00:30:31,541 --> 00:30:35,384
in our long-term retention, but there are a few things that happened around our UA that

537
00:30:35,424 --> 00:30:40,008
made me not want to throw that in the slides directly, just to be very clear about the

538
00:30:40,048 --> 00:30:45,051
data and have very clear directions, because it is a little bit more murky in overall aspects.

539
00:30:46,132 --> 00:30:52,657
Yeah, it's a little bit more complicated. You need to judge basically long-term retention.

540
00:30:52,797 --> 00:30:53,478
Is your D30, is your...

541
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:58,692
D9D retention increasing and compare that with the earlier cohorts.

542
00:30:59,672 --> 00:31:00,573
And on top of that,

543
00:31:00,593 --> 00:31:03,834
you need to also make sure that your LTV isn't dropping as a result.

544
00:31:04,815 --> 00:31:06,756
So it's possible that you introduce this feature.

545
00:31:07,036 --> 00:31:10,137
It's great, it's cool, but people are stopping spending on other areas of

546
00:31:10,157 --> 00:31:10,457
the game.

547
00:31:10,898 --> 00:31:14,079
And sure, or maybe they are sticking around longer, but

548
00:31:14,659 --> 00:31:16,840
they're not actually monetizing the longer they stay, and

549
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,641
it's not actually benefiting you overall.

550
00:31:19,061 --> 00:31:21,222
So those are the sort of things that you need to watch when you're doing

551
00:31:21,242 --> 00:31:22,543
the data analysis side of things.

552
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:27,354
I think you said something about flash mobs and real world impact of things.

553
00:31:27,734 --> 00:31:29,316
That's a cool idea I didn't think about.

554
00:31:29,656 --> 00:31:34,081
If you could incentivize your players to come up with real things in the actual world to

555
00:31:34,121 --> 00:31:34,261
do.

556
00:31:34,661 --> 00:31:36,743
I hadn't thought about that so I'm going to steal that idea later.

557
00:31:36,763 --> 00:31:43,150
I think I am out of time but you can grab me afterward if you want to ask any more questions

558
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:43,911
and bug me.

559
00:31:43,931 --> 00:31:44,852
Thanks everyone for coming.

560
00:31:44,872 --> 00:31:45,232
Thank you.

561
00:31:45,252 --> 00:31:45,492
Thank you.

562
00:31:45,512 --> 00:31:45,693
Thank you.

563
00:31:45,713 --> 00:31:45,913
Thank you.

564
00:31:45,933 --> 00:31:46,173
Thank you.

565
00:31:46,193 --> 00:31:46,373
Thank you.

566
00:31:46,393 --> 00:31:46,573
Thank you.
