1
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:07,512
Good morning everyone. My name is Alexander Bruce and I'm the creator of Antichamber,

2
00:00:07,952 --> 00:00:12,514
a mind-bending psychological exploration game that was released on Steam at the beginning of last year.

3
00:00:13,374 --> 00:00:17,696
Before I begin I want to say thank you to the IGS organizers for inviting me here today because

4
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:24,319
GDC, the IGS, the IGF were very important to my development. Five years ago I was sitting in this

5
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:28,161
room for the first time as someone just starting out and I was looking at the people on stage

6
00:00:28,201 --> 00:00:30,682
thinking these guys have made it and I want to know what they did.

7
00:00:31,709 --> 00:00:36,552
And I'm happy to share my story with you today of how I went from there to where I am now,

8
00:00:36,832 --> 00:00:37,353
which is here.

9
00:00:38,634 --> 00:00:42,856
Prior to the game's release, it was the IGF 2012 winner for technical excellence.

10
00:00:43,177 --> 00:00:44,958
The game was backed by the Indie Fund.

11
00:00:45,018 --> 00:00:48,500
It had been covered many, many times by most major news sites.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,202
After the game was released on the 31st of January,

13
00:00:52,148 --> 00:00:55,209
The game went on to sell 100,000 copies within 7 weeks.

14
00:00:55,769 --> 00:00:58,631
And lifetime sales are now at around 750,000 copies,

15
00:00:58,911 --> 00:01:00,612
with around $5 million gross revenue.

16
00:01:00,632 --> 00:01:02,432
So the question that I'm here to talk about today

17
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:04,093
is how this happened.

18
00:01:04,113 --> 00:01:05,834
You know, was it just a good idea?

19
00:01:05,914 --> 00:01:06,994
Did I know the right people?

20
00:01:07,695 --> 00:01:09,215
Or was I just very, very lucky?

21
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:12,017
This is going to come up a couple of times throughout the talk,

22
00:01:12,057 --> 00:01:16,099
but I'm going to start this talk by just giving you some of my philosophy on luck

23
00:01:16,339 --> 00:01:18,260
that was driving a lot of my decision making.

24
00:01:19,016 --> 00:01:22,597
And it's that first and foremost, if luck isn't everything,

25
00:01:23,017 --> 00:01:25,257
then it made sense to me to factor it out of everything.

26
00:01:25,277 --> 00:01:26,718
That's not to say that it doesn't exist,

27
00:01:27,078 --> 00:01:28,518
but it's something that I don't control.

28
00:01:28,858 --> 00:01:31,399
And so I'm going to factor it out of all my business decisions.

29
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:33,479
And when you do that, it means that you have to take

30
00:01:33,559 --> 00:01:36,100
all of the other things on this slide much more seriously.

31
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,380
And I believe if you do a good job of that,

32
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,341
you should at least be able to be successful.

33
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:42,481
And then if you get lucky, whatever that means,

34
00:01:42,741 --> 00:01:43,922
you're then more successful.

35
00:01:44,222 --> 00:01:45,822
Luck is a multiplier on your efforts.

36
00:01:45,922 --> 00:01:47,302
I don't believe it should be the thing

37
00:01:47,422 --> 00:01:48,803
that makes or breaks your success.

38
00:01:50,323 --> 00:01:52,964
And one of the reasons that I want to say that is when we're looking at other people's

39
00:01:52,984 --> 00:01:55,564
successes or failures, we don't have all of the information.

40
00:01:56,164 --> 00:01:59,365
And we use luck to describe things that we don't completely understand.

41
00:01:59,925 --> 00:02:04,166
And I realize that there's a very big difference between the public perception of what happened

42
00:02:04,486 --> 00:02:05,587
and the reality of what happened.

43
00:02:05,627 --> 00:02:07,387
So today I'm here to talk about reality.

44
00:02:07,707 --> 00:02:10,928
And I want to do this because five years ago, this is where I started.

45
00:02:11,268 --> 00:02:11,928
I was a student.

46
00:02:12,148 --> 00:02:15,549
I came from Melbourne, Australia, which is not an area that was known for making independent

47
00:02:15,589 --> 00:02:15,769
hits.

48
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:20,447
This was my first independent game, and I was working on it alone from a bedroom.

49
00:02:20,567 --> 00:02:24,549
But I did have one question that set me apart from the rest of my cohort at the time,

50
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:25,810
and that was this.

51
00:02:26,571 --> 00:02:29,653
What makes me different to people that I would deem to be successful?

52
00:02:29,913 --> 00:02:31,474
This was not an entitled question like,

53
00:02:31,574 --> 00:02:32,755
oh, why aren't I successful?

54
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:34,956
This was a genuinely curious question like,

55
00:02:35,036 --> 00:02:38,258
what did these people do, and is that something that I can do as well?

56
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:42,053
But it would actually be a bit unfair to say that this was the starting point,

57
00:02:42,073 --> 00:02:44,497
because even this question had to come from somewhere.

58
00:02:44,517 --> 00:02:47,521
I did not just wake up one day and wonder what made me different.

59
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:50,646
So I'm going to jump back very briefly to nine years ago,

60
00:02:50,686 --> 00:02:52,869
when I first got into anything games-related at all.

61
00:02:53,705 --> 00:02:57,929
I was a student starting out in university and I went into that with a very simple philosophy.

62
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:02,154
Pick any individual skill and I can guarantee that I will not be the best person at it.

63
00:03:02,334 --> 00:03:04,856
I am not the best artist because I've not been drawing since I was 10.

64
00:03:05,697 --> 00:03:08,040
I'm not the best programmer because I don't do it as a day job.

65
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,483
My skill set is a very technical, creative, analytical person.

66
00:03:12,304 --> 00:03:14,727
is to be very very different as a strategic decision.

67
00:03:14,767 --> 00:03:17,170
And I was doing this so that I could stand out in university,

68
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,712
so that I could then get into industry.

69
00:03:19,353 --> 00:03:20,834
And then I was going to stand out in industry,

70
00:03:20,874 --> 00:03:22,777
so that I could get promoted and get hired overseas,

71
00:03:22,837 --> 00:03:24,198
which is where I actually wanted to work.

72
00:03:26,011 --> 00:03:29,933
And so in 2006, when I was introduced to modding tools for Unreal Tournament 2004,

73
00:03:30,233 --> 00:03:31,154
I made things like this.

74
00:03:31,274 --> 00:03:33,875
I made a world full of tiles that I called dynamic geometry,

75
00:03:34,175 --> 00:03:36,036
that I could sweep complex algorithms across

76
00:03:36,936 --> 00:03:38,917
and get them to respond in all kinds of interesting ways.

77
00:03:39,398 --> 00:03:41,639
And I turned this into a multiplayer arena combat game.

78
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:44,240
It was very violent, and I decided to call this thing Hazard.

79
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,321
But when I tried to run this across a network,

80
00:03:47,241 --> 00:03:48,542
way too much stuff was going on,

81
00:03:48,622 --> 00:03:51,063
and I was not a network programmer at the time, so I put it down.

82
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:55,348
In 2007, that other one got way too big, way too fast,

83
00:03:55,388 --> 00:03:57,269
so I thought, I'm just gonna start small again.

84
00:03:57,289 --> 00:03:59,971
I just want to see what asteroids would look like in 3D,

85
00:04:00,091 --> 00:04:02,152
which meant that when I have to deal with the screen wrapping,

86
00:04:02,172 --> 00:04:05,294
I then have to deal with rendering perspective

87
00:04:05,774 --> 00:04:06,855
through the screen wrapping as well.

88
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:09,056
So I made this thing called Recursive Space.

89
00:04:09,177 --> 00:04:10,457
And again, it was an interesting system,

90
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:11,998
but I didn't know what to do with it at the time,

91
00:04:12,058 --> 00:04:12,679
so I put it down.

92
00:04:13,915 --> 00:04:18,558
But what these systems did was they got me hired to work in industry two and a half years through a four year degree.

93
00:04:18,598 --> 00:04:21,179
So my plan of standing out was definitely working.

94
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,901
But working in industry actually made me quite jaded.

95
00:04:24,261 --> 00:04:28,324
Because one of the first things that happened was my Unreal Engine 3 game that I was hired for got cancelled.

96
00:04:28,684 --> 00:04:31,366
Which took a lot of the core skills and just threw them out the window.

97
00:04:32,235 --> 00:04:35,376
And I then had the opportunity to move on to an infrastructure team,

98
00:04:35,856 --> 00:04:39,118
which was a great learning experience because I was there as a junior in my first year,

99
00:04:39,338 --> 00:04:43,520
and there were four seniors, the lead programmer and the technical director of the company,

100
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,341
which at the time had about 180 people.

101
00:04:45,761 --> 00:04:47,222
But the whole time I was there, I thought,

102
00:04:47,282 --> 00:04:49,323
how am I supposed to compete with these guys?

103
00:04:49,403 --> 00:04:52,644
And obviously no one was expecting that, but from a self-satisfaction level,

104
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:55,626
it was really demotivating and it just made me feel inadequate,

105
00:04:55,646 --> 00:04:58,367
and I started to doubt whether or not I was actually a programmer.

106
00:04:59,431 --> 00:05:03,973
Towards the end of the year, I also had to go through months of crunch on a game that I ultimately didn't think was very good.

107
00:05:04,313 --> 00:05:06,735
And the situation wasn't much better elsewhere in Australia.

108
00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:10,917
2008, 2009 is when the Australian industry started folding in on itself.

109
00:05:11,897 --> 00:05:14,238
But it's also the year that I discovered independent development.

110
00:05:14,499 --> 00:05:17,760
And I was looking at some of these guys, particularly the Nebacula Drop guys, thinking,

111
00:05:18,361 --> 00:05:21,182
these guys have figured it out. They've circumvented the system.

112
00:05:21,442 --> 00:05:24,584
It's a team of students who made a game that was very good, they went through some festivals,

113
00:05:24,864 --> 00:05:25,864
they got hired by Valve.

114
00:05:26,724 --> 00:05:29,487
And then they made Portal. They went straight from the bottom to the top.

115
00:05:29,527 --> 00:05:31,289
And so I was looking at all of these guys, thinking,

116
00:05:31,349 --> 00:05:32,610
what makes me different to them?

117
00:05:33,071 --> 00:05:35,513
They circumvented the system. How can I do this as well?

118
00:05:35,994 --> 00:05:37,896
And one of the things that I noticed about all of these guys

119
00:05:37,936 --> 00:05:38,877
was they went through festivals.

120
00:05:38,897 --> 00:05:40,218
So I thought, all right, that's the answer.

121
00:05:40,238 --> 00:05:41,320
I'm going to go through festivals.

122
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,523
And one of the festivals that was very applicable to me

123
00:05:44,563 --> 00:05:46,045
was this thing called Make Something Unreal.

124
00:05:46,385 --> 00:05:48,547
Now, I'd actually found out about this four years earlier.

125
00:05:49,455 --> 00:05:51,916
randomly one day when I walked into my brother's room and he was looking at the

126
00:05:51,956 --> 00:05:53,077
list of grand prize winners

127
00:05:53,637 --> 00:05:56,659
and he said man wouldn't it be cool to be one of these guys and I was like well

128
00:05:56,679 --> 00:05:57,259
yes but

129
00:05:57,579 --> 00:06:00,260
I know nothing about modding I don't know how to make a game

130
00:06:00,721 --> 00:06:03,962
and here I was four years later I still didn't consider myself a modder

131
00:06:04,343 --> 00:06:08,085
whatever that meant but I did have an unusual game I did know how to make

132
00:06:08,145 --> 00:06:08,825
things in Unreal

133
00:06:09,634 --> 00:06:13,116
And I decided I'm going to play this the same way that I play the education system.

134
00:06:13,136 --> 00:06:14,897
I'm going to submit something radically different,

135
00:06:15,057 --> 00:06:16,678
and I'm going to wait until the very end of the year,

136
00:06:16,978 --> 00:06:19,059
and then I'm going to submit something, and I'm going to surprise people.

137
00:06:19,099 --> 00:06:22,041
And that was this thing that I'd been working on called Hazard the Journey of Life,

138
00:06:22,601 --> 00:06:22,981
which was...

139
00:06:24,153 --> 00:06:26,433
I started off with my geometry and space prototypes,

140
00:06:26,473 --> 00:06:28,934
and then I added a branching map structure, I removed death.

141
00:06:28,974 --> 00:06:30,215
I made all kinds of weird choices,

142
00:06:30,255 --> 00:06:32,475
and it was ultimately something that was just for me.

143
00:06:32,495 --> 00:06:34,156
It was this little philosophical art piece

144
00:06:35,076 --> 00:06:36,796
that I was using as a diary as I was working out

145
00:06:36,816 --> 00:06:37,777
what I was doing in my life.

146
00:06:38,557 --> 00:06:40,657
And I decided that if I wanted to stand out,

147
00:06:40,717 --> 00:06:42,378
the visuals were going to be one of the first things

148
00:06:42,418 --> 00:06:43,058
that people saw.

149
00:06:43,078 --> 00:06:46,099
And one advantage that I had was everything else

150
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,419
that was going through the competition

151
00:06:47,539 --> 00:06:49,200
ultimately still looked like an Unreal game.

152
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,760
And you could see AAA games also just looked like

153
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,281
Unreal Engine 3 games, and I thought,

154
00:06:53,941 --> 00:06:57,524
They're all differentiating themselves with art, but they use similar lights and shaders.

155
00:06:57,684 --> 00:07:00,446
I don't have the time, resources, or skill to compete on that level,

156
00:07:00,866 --> 00:07:02,987
so I'm going to go completely down the other end of the spectrum

157
00:07:03,027 --> 00:07:06,630
and submit something that looks absolutely nothing like something that was made with Unreal.

158
00:07:08,831 --> 00:07:12,514
And in 2009, Sense of Wonder Night was another competition that announced its second year.

159
00:07:12,994 --> 00:07:14,635
And I found out about Sense of Wonder Night...

160
00:07:15,531 --> 00:07:17,834
the previous year, because Ian Dulles went through this as well.

161
00:07:18,194 --> 00:07:19,816
So I was looking at Ian Dulles, thinking,

162
00:07:20,217 --> 00:07:23,421
what makes him, the creator of the Unfinished Swan, different to me?

163
00:07:23,781 --> 00:07:26,325
He's a student from USC, I'm a student from Melbourne.

164
00:07:26,725 --> 00:07:29,989
His game has an interesting art style and theme, so does mine.

165
00:07:30,089 --> 00:07:32,793
His game's about exploration and discovery, as is mine.

166
00:07:33,694 --> 00:07:35,115
So I entered Sense of Wonder Night as well.

167
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:37,557
And fortunately for me, I got picked,

168
00:07:37,797 --> 00:07:39,559
which represented a very large opportunity.

169
00:07:39,799 --> 00:07:41,601
You know, I'd never been outside of Australia,

170
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:44,203
and I'd never been to one of these big gaming conventions,

171
00:07:44,243 --> 00:07:47,026
and here I was presenting something that I'd made in Japan.

172
00:07:47,887 --> 00:07:50,229
And so I thought, I may never be in this position again.

173
00:07:52,474 --> 00:07:55,196
If an opportunity comes up, whether that's speaking with someone,

174
00:07:55,256 --> 00:07:58,318
attending a session, using a piece of technology, I have two options.

175
00:07:58,859 --> 00:08:00,821
If I do nothing, I know exactly what will happen.

176
00:08:00,941 --> 00:08:03,863
Absolutely nothing will happen because I didn't try to make something happen.

177
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:07,686
If I do follow up on an opportunity, something might happen.

178
00:08:07,927 --> 00:08:09,708
Maybe something good, maybe something bad.

179
00:08:10,028 --> 00:08:14,272
But the fact that I don't know is the reason that I must follow up on every single opportunity.

180
00:08:14,472 --> 00:08:17,074
And one of those opportunities was talking with this guy,

181
00:08:17,194 --> 00:08:18,876
Mike Capps, the president of Epic Games.

182
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:23,973
He gave a keynote there, and when it ended, I walked up to him and I handed over a business card.

183
00:08:23,993 --> 00:08:24,953
I hesitated and I said,

184
00:08:24,973 --> 00:08:26,594
Hi, my name is Alexander Bruce.

185
00:08:27,395 --> 00:08:29,316
I've created this mod for Unreal Tournament.

186
00:08:29,336 --> 00:08:31,358
I'm presenting it at this thing called Sense of Wonder Night.

187
00:08:31,818 --> 00:08:34,620
I was just wondering, do you have a solution for independent developers?

188
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:39,063
And his answer was, well, yes, actually, we have this thing called the Unreal Development Kit.

189
00:08:39,244 --> 00:08:43,327
It's not announced yet, but I will put you onto Mark Raine, and we will find a solution to your problem.

190
00:08:43,968 --> 00:08:48,551
And this response really surprised me, because here's the president of a very large international corporation

191
00:08:48,992 --> 00:08:51,094
reaching out to me, some random student.

192
00:08:51,174 --> 00:08:55,137
And this taught me that everyone in this industry is just another person.

193
00:08:55,537 --> 00:08:59,861
At some stage in this guy's career, he was where I was that day starting out.

194
00:09:01,455 --> 00:09:05,140
I also had the chance to talk with Steve Swink, who was presenting his game Shadow Physics

195
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,463
there and he was one of the co-chairs of the IGF at the time.

196
00:09:08,445 --> 00:09:11,469
And as we were having a conversation one day, he said, you should join the indie community.

197
00:09:11,489 --> 00:09:14,112
And I said, I don't know, like I couldn't write my own engine.

198
00:09:14,332 --> 00:09:15,994
And he said, you could totally write your own engine.

199
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:19,279
You should go to GDC and you should meet these people because you'd fit right in.

200
00:09:20,207 --> 00:09:26,550
And what these kinds of conversations did was they reaffirmed my belief that festivals were a great way to get noticed.

201
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:29,871
I never had the opportunity to speak to some of these people back home in Australia,

202
00:09:29,891 --> 00:09:34,353
so I thought, I'm going to enter every festival that exists just so I can keep on talking to all of these people.

203
00:09:35,634 --> 00:09:39,055
I got selected for Make Something Unreal, and I won an Australian competition,

204
00:09:39,115 --> 00:09:41,997
so I started to get a bit confident, thinking, alright, I'll figure this out.

205
00:09:42,037 --> 00:09:44,718
I'm the same as those people from 2008, and I didn't get in.

206
00:09:46,113 --> 00:09:48,396
I got an honorable mention and my first reaction was like,

207
00:09:48,476 --> 00:09:49,537
what, why aren't I in there?

208
00:09:49,617 --> 00:09:52,361
Surely my game is as good as all of the other games that got picked.

209
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:55,265
Then I decided, like, what makes me different?

210
00:09:55,305 --> 00:09:56,106
Like, what have I missed?

211
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,469
So I went back and I looked at some of my other successes

212
00:09:58,509 --> 00:10:00,091
and I said, well, clearly something is different here.

213
00:10:00,131 --> 00:10:01,052
Clearly I'm missing something.

214
00:10:02,506 --> 00:10:05,268
I looked at Sense of Wonder Knight, and I said, all right, Sense of Wonder Knight was

215
00:10:05,308 --> 00:10:06,089
a new competition.

216
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,372
66 games were entered, and of them, 11 of them were picked.

217
00:10:09,412 --> 00:10:10,432
That's a one in six chance.

218
00:10:10,472 --> 00:10:12,494
It's not a guarantee, but those are very good odds.

219
00:10:12,914 --> 00:10:16,838
And I did well in Make Something Unreal, because Epic didn't expect such an unconventional

220
00:10:16,858 --> 00:10:17,078
game.

221
00:10:17,899 --> 00:10:21,381
And when I spoke to them later about it, they were like, honestly, man, we have no idea

222
00:10:21,401 --> 00:10:24,024
what the hell you did with our engine, but it was really good, so we thought you should

223
00:10:24,044 --> 00:10:24,464
get a prize.

224
00:10:27,613 --> 00:10:31,739
Whereas the IGF was very used to showcasing different and exceptional games.

225
00:10:31,779 --> 00:10:36,105
And this taught me that being different in amongst a sea of other different games

226
00:10:36,246 --> 00:10:37,588
is just a different kind of same.

227
00:10:37,608 --> 00:10:38,889
You're not going to stand out that way.

228
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,392
I later learned a more useful term.

229
00:10:41,257 --> 00:10:42,198
which was remarkable.

230
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:45,842
Not fun, not innovative, not polished, remarkable.

231
00:10:45,982 --> 00:10:47,263
Worth making a remark about.

232
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:49,145
This could either mean that you're conventional

233
00:10:49,205 --> 00:10:50,546
and absolutely exceptional,

234
00:10:50,926 --> 00:10:51,887
or it could mean you're different

235
00:10:51,947 --> 00:10:53,249
and executed very, very well,

236
00:10:53,649 --> 00:10:55,651
or it could mean that you are so completely insane

237
00:10:55,691 --> 00:10:56,311
that people are just like,

238
00:10:56,351 --> 00:10:57,893
I don't know, this could be the future of games.

239
00:11:01,576 --> 00:11:02,557
So I picked myself up,

240
00:11:02,858 --> 00:11:04,459
and starting out in 2010, I'm like,

241
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:06,521
alright, this is just the start of my independent career.

242
00:11:07,498 --> 00:11:11,543
I was one of the grand finals winners in Make Something Unreal, which gave me around $25,000,

243
00:11:11,643 --> 00:11:14,467
which I just invested straight back into the game over the next couple of years.

244
00:11:15,127 --> 00:11:18,491
I could use the Unreal Development Kit to make a commercial version, so my mod, which

245
00:11:18,532 --> 00:11:20,394
was worth nothing, could now be worth something.

246
00:11:21,355 --> 00:11:24,799
And in February 2010, I was contacted by Valve to put the game on Steam.

247
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,202
And this confused me a bit, because I didn't reach out to them,

248
00:11:27,262 --> 00:11:29,805
and I certainly hadn't had a lot of press at this stage.

249
00:11:30,285 --> 00:11:32,748
So I sent an email to Epic, and I said,

250
00:11:32,788 --> 00:11:34,129
do you guys know anything about this?

251
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,272
And they said, well, yeah, we thought your game was really good,

252
00:11:36,312 --> 00:11:37,593
so we told Valve that they should take it.

253
00:11:38,554 --> 00:11:40,376
And this taught me the power of advocates.

254
00:11:40,476 --> 00:11:43,359
I didn't have to make the connection with Valve at that stage myself,

255
00:11:43,479 --> 00:11:44,901
because I had a connection with Epic,

256
00:11:44,961 --> 00:11:46,582
and they could close that connection for me.

257
00:11:47,443 --> 00:11:49,085
So with all of these new circumstances,

258
00:11:49,185 --> 00:11:50,826
I decided to take Steve Swink's advice

259
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,608
and go to the Game Developers Conference.

260
00:11:53,898 --> 00:11:56,740
And at the GDC I did what you would expect from someone at their first conference.

261
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,161
I ran around having a lot of short conversations with people,

262
00:11:59,201 --> 00:12:01,242
handing out business cards to as many people as I could,

263
00:12:01,282 --> 00:12:02,303
trying to spread my name around.

264
00:12:02,603 --> 00:12:05,685
Because I realized I'm not the first person to try and make a successful game.

265
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:08,027
And I wanted to learn from what other people had done.

266
00:12:08,047 --> 00:12:09,548
I didn't want to make all of my own mistakes.

267
00:12:11,026 --> 00:12:13,887
And I was also invited to speak at this thing called the Nuovo Sessions.

268
00:12:13,987 --> 00:12:17,609
And I was invited because of my honorable mention at the IGF,

269
00:12:17,749 --> 00:12:21,191
but also because I'd been keeping in touch with Steve Swink since Sense of Wonder Night,

270
00:12:21,211 --> 00:12:23,552
and him and Matthew Wagner were the people who organized this thing,

271
00:12:23,973 --> 00:12:25,633
and they thought I had some interesting things to say.

272
00:12:26,054 --> 00:12:30,196
So going into this, I thought, all right, once again, I may never be in this position again.

273
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:33,578
I may never get the chance to speak at GDC again, but I want people to remember me.

274
00:12:33,718 --> 00:12:35,779
So I'm going to give them three things.

275
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:38,920
to remember me by and I don't care which one they remember.

276
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,481
They're going to see either a crazy passionate speech about risk and experimentation,

277
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:46,561
or they're going to see a very weird abstract game,

278
00:12:46,921 --> 00:12:50,062
or they're going to remember that someone wore a pink suit, and I didn't care which.

279
00:12:51,082 --> 00:12:54,483
And this taught me that being different can be very polarizing.

280
00:12:54,903 --> 00:12:57,244
Some people were totally on board with my eccentricity,

281
00:12:57,424 --> 00:12:59,564
and they thought that the presentation was very theatrical.

282
00:13:00,044 --> 00:13:01,985
Other people looked at me and were like, what a fucking weirdo.

283
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,566
And this was something that I was going to have to be careful about,

284
00:13:05,586 --> 00:13:08,848
because I wanted to stand out, but I also wanted to be taken seriously.

285
00:13:08,868 --> 00:13:12,711
I also had some interesting conversations at GDC.

286
00:13:13,531 --> 00:13:16,053
On the final day, there was a party, and it was a secret party,

287
00:13:16,113 --> 00:13:17,633
and a bunch of my new friends were going to it.

288
00:13:17,653 --> 00:13:18,534
And I kept on asking,

289
00:13:19,455 --> 00:13:20,415
can I come? And they were like,

290
00:13:20,455 --> 00:13:23,357
oh, I don't know, like, you know, it's not really my thing, I'm not sure.

291
00:13:24,097 --> 00:13:25,318
And as we were hanging out in the park,

292
00:13:25,658 --> 00:13:26,959
just before a bunch of people were going,

293
00:13:26,999 --> 00:13:28,800
I asked Heather Kelly, I was like, can I come?

294
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:29,560
And she said,

295
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:32,562
I think you can bring a friend, let me check the invite.

296
00:13:33,419 --> 00:13:35,520
She checked and she said, yep, you can come as my plus one.

297
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,161
And I thought about what other people had said

298
00:13:37,201 --> 00:13:38,562
and how it seemed like a bit of a secret.

299
00:13:39,102 --> 00:13:41,303
And I said, you know, I don't really know the hosts

300
00:13:41,564 --> 00:13:42,744
and I'm not really anyone,

301
00:13:42,784 --> 00:13:44,105
so I'm just going to go back to my hotel.

302
00:13:45,085 --> 00:13:47,447
And she said, I think you need to familiarize yourself

303
00:13:47,487 --> 00:13:48,888
with the phrase, fake it till you make it.

304
00:13:49,548 --> 00:13:51,249
Now, this is a totally cliched thing to say,

305
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:52,590
but at that point in time,

306
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:54,931
those were the exact words that I needed to hear, you know.

307
00:13:55,391 --> 00:13:56,332
Stop doubting yourself.

308
00:13:56,452 --> 00:13:58,353
Stop saying, I'm not indie, I'm not a model,

309
00:13:58,373 --> 00:13:59,974
I'm not a programmer, I'm not a designer,

310
00:13:59,994 --> 00:14:01,334
and say, if you want to be someone,

311
00:14:01,654 --> 00:14:03,035
stop being someone right now.

312
00:14:05,192 --> 00:14:08,132
At this party, I also had the chance to speak with Mare Shepard,

313
00:14:08,593 --> 00:14:11,113
who was one of the people who helped make M+.

314
00:14:12,013 --> 00:14:13,994
And she was one of the people who was on the Nuovo jury.

315
00:14:14,514 --> 00:14:16,115
And I was lamenting the fact that I didn't get in.

316
00:14:16,335 --> 00:14:16,855
And she said,

317
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:18,755
I really enjoyed playing your game.

318
00:14:18,795 --> 00:14:20,916
It was exactly the kind of puzzly thing that I like.

319
00:14:21,176 --> 00:14:22,816
I encourage you to not get discouraged

320
00:14:22,976 --> 00:14:24,797
and keep in mind that the jury changes every year.

321
00:14:25,377 --> 00:14:27,057
So here's someone who's been through this before,

322
00:14:27,097 --> 00:14:28,458
who knows what they're talking about, saying,

323
00:14:28,518 --> 00:14:30,558
you're almost there, just try again next time.

324
00:14:31,797 --> 00:14:34,560
And all of these conversations taught me the value of real networking.

325
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,943
Most of the cards that I'd handed out randomly to people didn't do anything at all.

326
00:14:37,983 --> 00:14:39,184
I never heard back from any of them.

327
00:14:39,744 --> 00:14:42,727
Whereas real networking was building genuine relationships with people.

328
00:14:42,827 --> 00:14:44,849
You caring about them, them caring about you,

329
00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:48,793
so that over time you can both help each other out and help each other rise up to the top.

330
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,065
So after GDC I thought, right, this is a very big change in circumstances, I know way more

331
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:58,230
now than I did going into it, so I'm going to take another three months to continue working

332
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:58,690
on my game.

333
00:14:59,552 --> 00:15:03,777
And in that three months, I got selected for IndieCade at E3, and I know that this pink

334
00:15:03,817 --> 00:15:07,641
suit was polarizing, but I thought, once is not a science, so I'm going to find the day

335
00:15:07,681 --> 00:15:09,924
with the most cameras around, and I'm going to wear it again.

336
00:15:10,865 --> 00:15:13,047
And I immediately noticed in the morning when I did this,

337
00:15:13,347 --> 00:15:15,209
that people were coming up to me saying,

338
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:17,752
I loved your GDC talk, I want to try and play your game.

339
00:15:18,233 --> 00:15:20,495
And this taught me that I was very good at getting people interested

340
00:15:20,595 --> 00:15:21,696
in wanting to try my game.

341
00:15:21,996 --> 00:15:24,419
And then at E3, they'd sit down, they'd play it for five minutes,

342
00:15:24,439 --> 00:15:25,460
and then they'd get up and they'd leave.

343
00:15:25,941 --> 00:15:27,642
Because the game wasn't holding people's interest.

344
00:15:28,652 --> 00:15:30,494
And I could have justified this at the time by saying,

345
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:32,116
well, you know, it's E3, this is a big event,

346
00:15:32,136 --> 00:15:33,538
there's so much interesting stuff around.

347
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,420
I didn't do that, because I thought,

348
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,382
when I'm trying to get press about this game,

349
00:15:37,723 --> 00:15:39,184
when I release the game on Steam,

350
00:15:39,224 --> 00:15:40,666
this is all going to, these are all going to be

351
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:41,627
very crowded markets.

352
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:44,010
My game should be able to hold people's interest

353
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,271
more than everything else around.

354
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:46,533
I need to solve this problem.

355
00:15:48,275 --> 00:15:49,996
And I also learned a bunch of marketing lessons.

356
00:15:50,136 --> 00:15:52,198
Standing around for three days trying to explain

357
00:15:52,238 --> 00:15:54,739
what the hell I was making, despite having a very difficult

358
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:57,722
problem to begin with, was extremely difficult.

359
00:15:57,782 --> 00:16:00,584
And I learned over time that the reason this is difficult

360
00:16:00,624 --> 00:16:02,705
is because you need to get good at explaining your game

361
00:16:02,785 --> 00:16:05,207
in a way that people who have no context will understand.

362
00:16:05,607 --> 00:16:07,148
You have all the context, they have none,

363
00:16:07,168 --> 00:16:08,449
and that's what you have to get good at.

364
00:16:08,489 --> 00:16:10,211
And you need to get good at it if you want people to care,

365
00:16:10,551 --> 00:16:12,472
because you're going to have to make trailers later.

366
00:16:12,492 --> 00:16:13,933
You're gonna have to talk with the press later.

367
00:16:13,953 --> 00:16:15,675
You're gonna have to make interesting store pages.

368
00:16:16,051 --> 00:16:17,965
and that takes a lot of practice and experience

369
00:16:18,005 --> 00:16:18,549
to get good at.

370
00:16:19,635 --> 00:16:22,255
So after the show, when I was looking at what kind of press coverage I got,

371
00:16:22,676 --> 00:16:23,816
there was a feature on IGN,

372
00:16:24,256 --> 00:16:26,197
and there was about how to stand out at E3,

373
00:16:26,577 --> 00:16:27,657
and there were some other mentions,

374
00:16:28,177 --> 00:16:31,338
but there wasn't this, like, immediate explosion of interest

375
00:16:31,398 --> 00:16:32,378
and everyone caring about me.

376
00:16:32,418 --> 00:16:35,559
So I'm looking at these other games that did seem to have all of this coverage,

377
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:37,660
and I was like, what did they do? Like, what have I missed out on?

378
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,621
And I thought, all right, well, one of the most obvious ones is,

379
00:16:40,841 --> 00:16:42,841
is that people weren't playing the game for long.

380
00:16:42,881 --> 00:16:44,021
It wasn't holding their interest.

381
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:46,582
They couldn't see all of the things that I found were so interesting about it.

382
00:16:47,678 --> 00:16:50,900
And watching people directly revealed a hell of a lot of issues to me.

383
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,340
I knew exactly what I needed to fix.

384
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,962
And so, from this point, I then continued testing the game constantly,

385
00:16:56,042 --> 00:16:57,863
on people at home, sending it to festivals,

386
00:16:58,303 --> 00:17:00,705
watching people at conferences, etc.

387
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:03,806
Because I wanted to understand how people thought.

388
00:17:03,866 --> 00:17:06,568
I wanted to understand what would make this game interesting to people.

389
00:17:08,023 --> 00:17:09,465
And this taught me a lesson about refinement.

390
00:17:09,766 --> 00:17:12,911
The higher in quality any individual aspect of your game gets,

391
00:17:13,271 --> 00:17:15,295
the more other areas start to stick out as wrong.

392
00:17:15,475 --> 00:17:17,899
And so the fact that my design was now getting much, much better

393
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:20,283
meant that the absence of sound design was becoming a real problem.

394
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,383
Throughout the rest of 2010 I continued trying to enter these competitions.

395
00:17:25,763 --> 00:17:28,566
And after a string of good fortune, I then had a lot of misfortune.

396
00:17:28,586 --> 00:17:31,788
I didn't get into the PAX 10, I didn't get into the IndieCade Festival.

397
00:17:31,828 --> 00:17:34,951
And I was crunching constantly because all of these deadlines were really close together.

398
00:17:34,991 --> 00:17:37,874
And this was making me very, very physically sick doing this.

399
00:17:38,394 --> 00:17:40,416
I wasn't getting enough done, so I was working longer,

400
00:17:40,456 --> 00:17:42,798
which meant I was sleeping less, which meant I was becoming sick,

401
00:17:42,818 --> 00:17:44,659
which meant I was ultimately getting less work done.

402
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,001
And I was struggling at this stage, and I'm thinking...

403
00:17:48,212 --> 00:17:49,834
What makes me different to these other people?

404
00:17:50,214 --> 00:17:51,676
Am I struggling because I'm not good?

405
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,738
Or am I struggling because this is hard?

406
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,941
So I thought, I have to go to Indicade

407
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:57,623
despite not getting into the festival,

408
00:17:57,984 --> 00:17:59,345
because I need to know the answer to that.

409
00:17:59,385 --> 00:18:00,707
I need to talk to people about this.

410
00:18:02,603 --> 00:18:05,086
On the way to Indicator, I also had to stop off at GDC Online

411
00:18:05,306 --> 00:18:09,572
for another competition, and this one had a $100,000 prize.

412
00:18:10,453 --> 00:18:12,716
Trying to not set any expectations about a prize

413
00:18:12,776 --> 00:18:15,079
that ultimately has $100,000 is pretty difficult.

414
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,864
And so I didn't win, and I just got really burned by expectations again.

415
00:18:18,884 --> 00:18:20,886
It's a very difficult lesson to learn not to do that.

416
00:18:21,773 --> 00:18:23,234
But I was seeing signs of progress.

417
00:18:23,794 --> 00:18:25,736
Earlier issues that I'd seen at E3 were now gone,

418
00:18:26,036 --> 00:18:27,397
but then I was just seeing later issues.

419
00:18:27,417 --> 00:18:29,259
Now I was just seeing issues 20 minutes through

420
00:18:29,299 --> 00:18:30,419
rather than 5 minutes through.

421
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,941
I met Robin Arnett, my sound design,

422
00:18:32,961 --> 00:18:35,243
so we could get the sound design up to the same quality

423
00:18:35,283 --> 00:18:35,884
as everything else.

424
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:38,445
And I was also getting increasing interest from publishers,

425
00:18:38,486 --> 00:18:40,167
and I thought, all right, maybe these guys could help out

426
00:18:40,247 --> 00:18:41,808
because, you know, there are things I'm struggling with.

427
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:43,629
They're used to dealing with this kind of stuff.

428
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,251
And maybe they could help with consoles,

429
00:18:45,271 --> 00:18:47,212
which were becoming more of a big deal at the time.

430
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:50,161
And when I went to IndieCade to talk to people about this,

431
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:52,583
Ron Carmel said, don't go with a publisher.

432
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:54,445
If you can get this game greenlit on a console,

433
00:18:54,505 --> 00:18:55,386
I will fund you myself.

434
00:18:55,566 --> 00:18:57,148
Now, this was after the IndieFund announcement,

435
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:58,669
as they were working out what kinds of games

436
00:18:59,310 --> 00:18:59,891
they should fund.

437
00:19:00,831 --> 00:19:02,553
And I think this was him looking at the game, saying,

438
00:19:03,094 --> 00:19:04,996
publishers are just going to ruin what you're

439
00:19:05,016 --> 00:19:06,177
trying to make with this game.

440
00:19:06,237 --> 00:19:08,239
So I will fund you myself if necessary.

441
00:19:09,512 --> 00:19:11,074
And I also spoke with Daniel Ben-Mergui.

442
00:19:11,654 --> 00:19:14,337
And after IndyCade, I said I was going to go to Japan

443
00:19:14,377 --> 00:19:16,939
to try and have some time off, because Sense of Wonderland

444
00:19:16,959 --> 00:19:18,521
was really refreshing for my mental state.

445
00:19:18,561 --> 00:19:22,345
And he said, going to Japan alone won't solve your problem.

446
00:19:22,385 --> 00:19:24,467
You're doing really well, but you need to slow down

447
00:19:24,507 --> 00:19:26,048
or you will just keep making yourself sick.

448
00:19:26,088 --> 00:19:27,950
You need to change your mindset about this.

449
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:29,171
You know, this was a marathon,

450
00:19:29,191 --> 00:19:30,713
and I was sprinting the entire time.

451
00:19:32,932 --> 00:19:35,732
So I went to Japan, I came back, and then things started to turn around.

452
00:19:35,752 --> 00:19:38,893
I got into the IGF China, I got into the IGF,

453
00:19:39,133 --> 00:19:43,074
I'd upgraded my honorable mention for the Nuovo up to a finalist for the Nuovo,

454
00:19:43,634 --> 00:19:45,354
and I got nominated in the Indie Game Challenge,

455
00:19:45,414 --> 00:19:48,315
another $100,000 competition, which I also didn't win.

456
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:51,716
But DICE was interesting because it was an executive conference

457
00:19:51,756 --> 00:19:53,116
and a lot of important people were there.

458
00:19:53,696 --> 00:19:55,737
So knowing that Ron said he would fund me,

459
00:19:55,917 --> 00:19:57,957
I would also have to deal with an engine license.

460
00:19:57,997 --> 00:19:59,978
And so I spoke with Mike Camps and Mark Rain again,

461
00:20:00,018 --> 00:20:02,418
who I'd spoken with several times throughout the year.

462
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:04,440
And I told them this problem.

463
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,440
They said, Mark said,

464
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,861
well, we can give you an engine license.

465
00:20:06,941 --> 00:20:08,402
And I said, I can't afford that.

466
00:20:08,422 --> 00:20:09,303
And he was like, it doesn't matter.

467
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:11,184
We'll use the UDK to filter people.

468
00:20:11,484 --> 00:20:13,286
We'll just give you a license under the same terms.

469
00:20:13,326 --> 00:20:14,406
And then that solves that problem.

470
00:20:15,267 --> 00:20:17,328
So knowing I've got funding and a license,

471
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:19,470
I then started following up things very seriously

472
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,771
with Sony and Microsoft, trying to make something happen.

473
00:20:23,312 --> 00:20:24,713
I was also making some good connections

474
00:20:24,733 --> 00:20:25,854
with the press at this time.

475
00:20:26,034 --> 00:20:28,156
And these were all editor-in-chiefs of various websites.

476
00:20:29,225 --> 00:20:29,586
most of them.

477
00:20:30,386 --> 00:20:32,767
And I started having some interesting questions come up,

478
00:20:32,787 --> 00:20:33,888
because some of these guys were like,

479
00:20:33,928 --> 00:20:35,708
how are you going to appeal to the Call of Duty crowd?

480
00:20:36,049 --> 00:20:38,370
Or, my daughter loves Minecraft, why would she play this?

481
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,751
And these were obviously very frustrating questions,

482
00:20:40,811 --> 00:20:43,392
because I wasn't trying to aim at the Call of Duty crowd.

483
00:20:44,392 --> 00:20:46,133
But the fact that people were asking these questions

484
00:20:46,153 --> 00:20:48,134
was very interesting, because people were no longer just

485
00:20:48,494 --> 00:20:50,335
dismissing this game as some artistic thing.

486
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:53,117
Now they're actually concerned about how I was going to find an audience for it.

487
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:57,665
And Dino Patti was there with Limbo, and he could see that I was obviously very frustrated

488
00:20:57,705 --> 00:20:58,606
by some of these questions.

489
00:20:58,706 --> 00:21:00,609
And he said, ignore everything those guys said.

490
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,853
We were getting asked the same questions before Limbo was released.

491
00:21:04,113 --> 00:21:05,675
You're doing fine, keep doing what you're doing.

492
00:21:05,795 --> 00:21:08,919
So like with Steve, like with me, these are people who know what they're talking about,

493
00:21:08,939 --> 00:21:11,602
who've been through this before, saying you're on the right track, just stay on target.

494
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:16,051
And Jamie Cheng was one of the judges of the Indie Game Challenge.

495
00:21:16,652 --> 00:21:18,153
And he enjoyed playing the game, but he said,

496
00:21:18,213 --> 00:21:19,154
why is it called Hazard?

497
00:21:19,494 --> 00:21:21,075
And I justified it to him, and he said,

498
00:21:21,135 --> 00:21:23,397
hmm, that's interesting, but the title didn't match

499
00:21:23,437 --> 00:21:24,918
the experience I had playing the game.

500
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:27,340
And this was more feedback than people would give me previously.

501
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,281
People would just be like, I hate the name, it's pretentious.

502
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:30,742
And I was like, I can't do anything with that.

503
00:21:31,162 --> 00:21:33,124
You know, you're not actually helping me solve the problem.

504
00:21:33,144 --> 00:21:36,066
Whereas here was someone who actually wanted to know more.

505
00:21:36,986 --> 00:21:39,989
But I had bigger fish to fry at that stage because I was in the IGF.

506
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:43,713
And if this was going to be when I was going to get all of the interest,

507
00:21:43,753 --> 00:21:45,575
this was going to make me the same as those games from 2008.

508
00:21:46,116 --> 00:21:48,378
And I thought, my game is so new over,

509
00:21:48,418 --> 00:21:51,221
I've got such a good chance of winning this thing, and I didn't win.

510
00:21:51,241 --> 00:21:53,904
And this was the last time that I was going to let myself

511
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:56,667
get burned by these expectations.

512
00:21:56,927 --> 00:21:59,149
I was not going to set any expectations from that moment on.

513
00:22:00,338 --> 00:22:03,000
And I also didn't get any explosion in interest,

514
00:22:03,501 --> 00:22:06,283
because I thought just being in the IGF would be enough,

515
00:22:06,323 --> 00:22:07,484
and so I didn't contact anyone.

516
00:22:07,504 --> 00:22:08,625
I didn't contact any press.

517
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:10,366
And I got some coverage on the show floor,

518
00:22:10,386 --> 00:22:11,988
but I certainly didn't get as much coverage

519
00:22:12,028 --> 00:22:14,670
as some of the other games that were around.

520
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:17,853
And I thought, what makes me different to the people who,

521
00:22:18,233 --> 00:22:19,394
you know, what makes me different to the people

522
00:22:19,414 --> 00:22:20,715
from 2008 and 2009 that I knew about?

523
00:22:20,775 --> 00:22:21,396
And then I started thinking.

524
00:22:25,066 --> 00:22:28,987
Actually, what happened to all of the other people who also got forgotten in the IGF?

525
00:22:29,227 --> 00:22:30,988
What didn't they do?

526
00:22:31,928 --> 00:22:34,549
And also what happened to all of the people who never went through festivals

527
00:22:34,609 --> 00:22:36,790
but still had successes and still had failures?

528
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:39,470
And this taught me that just looking at the successful people

529
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:41,331
was making me miss out on half of the story.

530
00:22:44,334 --> 00:22:46,335
I was having some more signs of progress, though.

531
00:22:46,515 --> 00:22:49,317
Now at the IGF pavilion, where there was lots of interesting stuff around,

532
00:22:49,397 --> 00:22:52,579
people were sitting and playing my game for an average of 40 to 90 minutes,

533
00:22:52,619 --> 00:22:53,780
which was a very good sign.

534
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,922
And I was also trying to negotiate console versions with Sony and Microsoft,

535
00:22:58,342 --> 00:23:00,744
and so I thought, this is going to take at least another six months.

536
00:23:01,664 --> 00:23:03,665
And then this started to come up. More and more and more.

537
00:23:03,685 --> 00:23:05,326
And these were people that I respected greatly,

538
00:23:05,366 --> 00:23:07,368
who were wanting to help me solve this problem

539
00:23:07,388 --> 00:23:09,209
and understand why it was going to be such an issue.

540
00:23:10,257 --> 00:23:12,399
So Jonathan was looking at it, and he was saying,

541
00:23:12,479 --> 00:23:13,980
I understand how you ended up here.

542
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:17,123
I understand that the theme has helped you work out

543
00:23:17,363 --> 00:23:19,945
what you're actually creating, but this is a game

544
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:21,947
that I think a lot of people are really going to want to play,

545
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:24,288
and you need to make sure that you get your first impressions right.

546
00:23:24,328 --> 00:23:26,350
And not only is Hazard not the right name,

547
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:27,691
it's actually a counterproductive name,

548
00:23:27,731 --> 00:23:29,893
because it makes it sound like it's in the same vein

549
00:23:29,953 --> 00:23:31,915
as games like Killzone and Bulletstorm,

550
00:23:32,435 --> 00:23:34,917
and not only are you not going to be able to compete

551
00:23:34,957 --> 00:23:36,278
on marketing budgets with those games,

552
00:23:36,318 --> 00:23:37,799
but that's not even the audience that you want.

553
00:23:38,688 --> 00:23:41,330
And the subtitle, The Journey of Life, obviously there's problems there.

554
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:42,950
So, this is why you need to change this.

555
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:46,992
And I said, well, I can't change it now, because, like, now I've got all of this exposure,

556
00:23:47,012 --> 00:23:49,433
and I've just been through the IJF, like, that seems super risky.

557
00:23:49,453 --> 00:23:51,114
Like, how am I going to build up all of that exposure again?

558
00:23:51,694 --> 00:23:56,236
And he said, I know it seems like you have a whole lot of interest in this game right now,

559
00:23:56,276 --> 00:24:00,018
but that's going to be completely insignificant relative to the amount of interest that you could get

560
00:24:00,098 --> 00:24:01,679
if you get all of these decisions right.

561
00:24:02,779 --> 00:24:04,100
So this was a massive leap of faith.

562
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,521
And it took a number of weeks of dealing with these guys.

563
00:24:08,712 --> 00:24:11,294
to decide to rename the game to Anti-Chamber.

564
00:24:11,715 --> 00:24:14,156
And when I said this either in text or in speech,

565
00:24:15,097 --> 00:24:17,319
it brought all the right connotations to mind immediately.

566
00:24:17,379 --> 00:24:19,560
People thought inverse chamber, against chamber,

567
00:24:19,621 --> 00:24:20,982
and entrance to a larger space.

568
00:24:21,562 --> 00:24:22,683
This was exactly what I needed.

569
00:24:22,703 --> 00:24:24,164
And I thought, if I'm going to pull this off,

570
00:24:24,304 --> 00:24:25,165
I need something big.

571
00:24:25,485 --> 00:24:27,607
And fortunately for me, I got into the PAX 10.

572
00:24:27,867 --> 00:24:31,309
So I announced the name change immediately after I got that notification,

573
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:34,552
ahead of when they were going to announce the finalists.

574
00:24:35,645 --> 00:24:37,206
And only one site posted about it.

575
00:24:37,727 --> 00:24:39,428
And I'm pretty sure that only Joystick did this

576
00:24:39,488 --> 00:24:41,270
because I'd met Alexander Sluinski at Dice

577
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:43,372
and he thought I was interesting and he wanted to help me out.

578
00:24:43,892 --> 00:24:45,814
And this taught me that what's big news to you

579
00:24:46,094 --> 00:24:47,656
may be nothing to someone else.

580
00:24:48,036 --> 00:24:49,758
If I was going to get people to care,

581
00:24:49,778 --> 00:24:51,920
I needed to go into overdrive on this thing.

582
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,682
So I submitted footage to Indie Game The Movie.

583
00:24:55,042 --> 00:24:56,804
I backed their Kickstarter for $300

584
00:24:57,184 --> 00:24:59,246
on the off chance that that went off and became a big success.

585
00:25:00,178 --> 00:25:03,364
I got into Indiecade, I went through a couple of Australian festivals again,

586
00:25:03,384 --> 00:25:06,790
and I started sending the game off to festivals all around the world,

587
00:25:07,311 --> 00:25:09,815
and art galleries, and schools,

588
00:25:10,156 --> 00:25:13,121
so that anyone who wanted the game could just take it and spread word of it.

589
00:25:14,988 --> 00:25:17,329
And as I'm running around doing all of this, I've got people saying,

590
00:25:17,769 --> 00:25:19,149
why are you trying so hard?

591
00:25:19,609 --> 00:25:22,250
Like, why didn't you just give up and move on to your next thing?

592
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:25,371
And I said, I'm trying to get something up to the same quality

593
00:25:25,431 --> 00:25:26,771
as games like Raiden World of Goo.

594
00:25:27,212 --> 00:25:29,632
And they'd be like, well, that's a big call for an Indian.

595
00:25:29,652 --> 00:25:30,733
I said, what are you talking about?

596
00:25:31,693 --> 00:25:33,715
Brayden and World of Goo were both independent games.

597
00:25:33,755 --> 00:25:35,397
They were both made by two people.

598
00:25:35,598 --> 00:25:37,600
And I'd be like, well, yeah, but those guys had experience.

599
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,764
And I said, Ron and Kyle have their set of experiences

600
00:25:40,784 --> 00:25:42,366
that helped make that specific game.

601
00:25:42,826 --> 00:25:45,490
Jonathan had his experiences. I have my experiences.

602
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:47,892
An introspective, psychological person.

603
00:25:47,932 --> 00:25:49,334
This is what I'm funneling into the game.

604
00:25:50,125 --> 00:25:53,047
And they'd be like, well yeah, but those games cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.

605
00:25:53,387 --> 00:25:57,251
And I'm like, if you cost my game effectively, my game also costs hundreds of thousands of dollars,

606
00:25:57,611 --> 00:25:59,793
I have just solved that problem in another way.

607
00:26:00,113 --> 00:26:03,496
And I realized that the answer to what makes me different by this stage was actually nothing.

608
00:26:03,536 --> 00:26:07,959
But I only understood this having gone through doing the same thing as all of these other people.

609
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:10,341
And then I realized there's actually another question that I need here.

610
00:26:11,022 --> 00:26:12,322
Which is how do I not mess this up?

611
00:26:12,822 --> 00:26:15,764
Half of my success was finding out what it took to be successful.

612
00:26:16,104 --> 00:26:17,784
The other half was not making mistakes.

613
00:26:17,864 --> 00:26:19,545
And one of those would have been the name,

614
00:26:19,565 --> 00:26:21,506
because it's the first impressions that people see.

615
00:26:21,886 --> 00:26:24,367
The other one would have been if I continued chasing up consoles,

616
00:26:24,407 --> 00:26:26,528
because these were taking up a hell of a lot of time.

617
00:26:26,908 --> 00:26:29,549
And that was time that was being taken away from the design.

618
00:26:29,809 --> 00:26:31,169
So I didn't follow up with Microsoft,

619
00:26:31,249 --> 00:26:33,430
and I was in negotiations with Sony for a long time.

620
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:35,831
And they did offer me a large sum of money at one stage,

621
00:26:35,871 --> 00:26:36,331
but I thought,

622
00:26:36,932 --> 00:26:39,915
A worse game on more consoles is not a net benefit to anyone.

623
00:26:39,955 --> 00:26:41,636
This is such a risk for a design.

624
00:26:42,757 --> 00:26:44,639
I need the best game on the platform.

625
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:45,320
It fits most.

626
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,261
It fits for Steam.

627
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:47,542
That's the audience I knew.

628
00:26:47,862 --> 00:26:51,926
And I also thought when I made that decision, I don't even own a PS3 or an Xbox 360, so

629
00:26:51,966 --> 00:26:54,528
why the hell am I trying to make something for a market I don't understand?

630
00:26:56,899 --> 00:27:00,322
So then I went off to the PAX 10, and I'd learned a hell of a lot from the IGF.

631
00:27:00,382 --> 00:27:02,363
This time I went in with no expectations.

632
00:27:02,443 --> 00:27:05,705
Honestly, I thought Fez was going to get all of the attention, or Jamestown, or something else.

633
00:27:06,086 --> 00:27:07,307
I just wanted to have a good show.

634
00:27:07,387 --> 00:27:09,688
I knew how hard it was to get attention by this stage.

635
00:27:11,389 --> 00:27:12,110
And then this happened.

636
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:14,271
Steven Tuttillo from Kotaku said,

637
00:27:14,312 --> 00:27:15,372
My favorite game of PAX.

638
00:27:16,073 --> 00:27:18,495
Griffin McElroy wrote the best preview of the game.

639
00:27:18,515 --> 00:27:22,677
Ryan Davis from Giant Bomb covered the whole PAX 10,

640
00:27:22,718 --> 00:27:24,579
and the comments started going crazy about my game.

641
00:27:25,705 --> 00:27:29,346
G4TV and Machinima also picked it as like one of their favorite things of the show,

642
00:27:29,426 --> 00:27:31,006
and I met Notch, and he also really enjoyed it.

643
00:27:32,046 --> 00:27:34,267
So this was exactly the kind of reception I'd been chasing,

644
00:27:34,287 --> 00:27:38,788
and I responded to it with depression, because now that I had all of these rising expectations,

645
00:27:38,848 --> 00:27:41,549
I thought, my game is still months away from being done,

646
00:27:41,569 --> 00:27:45,750
and now I have to actually live up to all of these people that are excited about this

647
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:46,010
thing.

648
00:27:46,551 --> 00:27:48,511
And I was running out of shows, and I was running out of money.

649
00:27:50,472 --> 00:27:53,693
So I thought, I have to get this thing finished, so I'm going to give myself IGF 2012.

650
00:27:55,509 --> 00:27:57,411
as a deadline for this and then I'm just going to release it.

651
00:27:58,492 --> 00:28:01,735
And then I got nominated again for the technical excellence category.

652
00:28:01,755 --> 00:28:04,018
And this time I'd learned from all of my mistakes from the iGIF.

653
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:06,060
I'd learned from my mistakes from the PAX 10 as well.

654
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,984
And one of the things I'd noticed at the PAX 10 is that there was a lot of shaky cam footage

655
00:28:10,024 --> 00:28:13,147
of the game because I didn't actually release any new footage of the game after I announced

656
00:28:13,167 --> 00:28:13,707
the name change.

657
00:28:13,747 --> 00:28:15,169
I just released teaser screenshots.

658
00:28:16,225 --> 00:28:20,927
So I thought, alright, I will need good, solid footage that I've made that really shows off

659
00:28:20,967 --> 00:28:23,267
the game for the IGF for PAX East.

660
00:28:23,767 --> 00:28:27,228
And in order to do this, I got help from other people who are experts at doing this.

661
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:31,229
Kurt Gartner makes a bunch of independent trailers, and Antoine Fortier-Auclair was

662
00:28:31,249 --> 00:28:34,710
someone that I'd met at PAX who is the person who cuts the trailers for Assassin's Creed

663
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:35,230
at Ubisoft.

664
00:28:36,728 --> 00:28:39,671
And this time when I sent this out to the press, it also came with a call to action.

665
00:28:40,472 --> 00:28:43,094
Come interview me at PAX. Come preview my game at PAX.

666
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:46,576
Tell your readers that they can come find the game at PAX East.

667
00:28:46,897 --> 00:28:48,978
And I picked a very quiet day to release this thing.

668
00:28:49,399 --> 00:28:51,040
And what happened was this saturated the news.

669
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,603
Because I'd sent it to so many contacts who were now really interested in me,

670
00:28:54,763 --> 00:28:57,285
they all posted about it. And because they were all posting about it,

671
00:28:57,325 --> 00:29:01,048
a whole lot of other news sites just started catching wind of it and posting about it as well.

672
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:03,870
And then Notch retweeted it. Epic posted about it.

673
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:04,891
A whole lot of other people with...

674
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:06,940
with a reach way larger than me,

675
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,801
were also posting about it.

676
00:29:09,902 --> 00:29:10,942
So going into the IGF,

677
00:29:11,383 --> 00:29:13,204
again, no expectations of anything.

678
00:29:13,364 --> 00:29:15,725
I thought Fez was going to win the award for technical excellence,

679
00:29:15,865 --> 00:29:17,686
and then I won the award for technical excellence,

680
00:29:17,987 --> 00:29:19,147
which was an absolute shock.

681
00:29:20,248 --> 00:29:20,368
And...

682
00:29:20,388 --> 00:29:27,652
APPLAUSE

683
00:29:27,672 --> 00:29:29,614
I also signed with the Indy Fund at this stage.

684
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,221
And at this stage I wasn't seeing any issues in the game anymore.

685
00:29:35,242 --> 00:29:36,802
And I also had some really good coverage.

686
00:29:36,822 --> 00:29:38,563
And this wasn't just because the game was better.

687
00:29:38,603 --> 00:29:39,703
This wasn't just because I won.

688
00:29:39,723 --> 00:29:42,064
This was because I had done a hell of a lot more work

689
00:29:42,885 --> 00:29:45,646
in the months leading up to this to try and get all of this attention.

690
00:29:47,106 --> 00:29:50,528
And I responded to this after the show by making statements like this.

691
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:55,353
My game still isn't done. I feel worse than I've ever felt.

692
00:29:56,173 --> 00:29:58,595
I don't have anything to work towards now. They took away my goal.

693
00:29:59,336 --> 00:30:03,319
This doesn't sound like someone who just received an award they'd been chasing for three years.

694
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,722
This sounds like someone who's having a mental breakdown.

695
00:30:07,302 --> 00:30:11,806
And at this stage, I couldn't quit because that would have been a waste of several years of my life.

696
00:30:12,427 --> 00:30:15,129
And I couldn't release an unfinished game because that definitely wouldn't have lived up

697
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:17,471
to the expectations that I'd built.

698
00:30:18,212 --> 00:30:18,892
Now, fortunately...

699
00:30:20,091 --> 00:30:24,613
Indie Game, the movie came out and it was very reassuring that other people were going through this as well.

700
00:30:25,913 --> 00:30:29,995
Now I know that this movie got a hell of a lot of criticism because people were like,

701
00:30:30,315 --> 00:30:32,716
making games isn't like that, making games is fun.

702
00:30:33,596 --> 00:30:35,817
I'm watching these people struggle.

703
00:30:36,277 --> 00:30:39,238
And I'm watching this, you know, watching Phil Fish have a terrible PAX East,

704
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:44,060
I'm thinking I'm showing at PAX East for the first booth that I've actually paid for in three weeks.

705
00:30:46,548 --> 00:30:50,631
By 2012, I knew what I was doing and things just started to snowball.

706
00:30:51,511 --> 00:30:53,733
So I was just trying desperately to finish this game.

707
00:30:53,793 --> 00:30:57,956
And I was starting to become very jealous of all of these other games that were releasing.

708
00:30:57,976 --> 00:30:59,637
And I was thinking, oh, what makes me different?

709
00:30:59,677 --> 00:31:02,659
Obviously, it's that they could finish their games and I couldn't at this stage.

710
00:31:03,699 --> 00:31:06,121
But I was also getting very paranoid about failure

711
00:31:06,141 --> 00:31:08,282
because some of the other people that had been through these festivals

712
00:31:08,342 --> 00:31:10,624
and come up alongside me released their games

713
00:31:10,664 --> 00:31:12,725
and they had very quiet launches and they just went away.

714
00:31:12,765 --> 00:31:15,127
And I thought, how do I make sure that that doesn't happen to me?

715
00:31:16,163 --> 00:31:17,925
So I thought, I have to give myself PAX East,

716
00:31:18,345 --> 00:31:20,547
and PAX Prime will definitely be my last show.

717
00:31:22,729 --> 00:31:25,071
And YouTube streamers were becoming more and more of a big deal

718
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:25,831
throughout 2011, 2012.

719
00:31:26,632 --> 00:31:29,954
And in the lead-up to PAX Prime,

720
00:31:29,994 --> 00:31:32,096
I see this tweet from TotalBiscuitGoOut that says,

721
00:31:32,176 --> 00:31:34,878
for your information, we're almost booked out of slots for PAX,

722
00:31:34,938 --> 00:31:37,781
so if you want to get your game looked at, contact this PR company.

723
00:31:38,661 --> 00:31:39,662
So straight away I jumped on it.

724
00:31:40,247 --> 00:31:42,870
And I recorded a really good video with TotalBiscuit.

725
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:45,633
And after we stopped recording, I thought,

726
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:48,517
this is the best possible marketing material that I could make.

727
00:31:48,877 --> 00:31:51,440
It's the experience that people had at shows,

728
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,704
it's someone playing the game for the first time, giving their impressions,

729
00:31:54,764 --> 00:31:57,767
and then I can step in and keep giving a whole lot of the really interesting...

730
00:31:59,094 --> 00:32:02,337
background information and talk about psychology and puzzle design, etc.

731
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:04,739
And so I said to him, when are you going to release these videos?

732
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:08,803
And he said, we're going to release these as a PAX roundup in the weeks after PAX.

733
00:32:09,023 --> 00:32:11,825
And I thought, hmm, that could be a bit of a problem because

734
00:32:12,166 --> 00:32:13,667
my game is still like a couple of months away.

735
00:32:13,687 --> 00:32:14,928
And he's like, no, no, no, don't worry about it.

736
00:32:14,968 --> 00:32:16,089
We'll talk about your game.

737
00:32:17,072 --> 00:32:19,073
again when it releases. And I'm like, okay.

738
00:32:19,614 --> 00:32:21,815
So then I run around the Indie Mega booth where I was showing the game

739
00:32:21,875 --> 00:32:23,537
and I talk with as many developers as I can.

740
00:32:23,557 --> 00:32:25,939
And I'm like, I just made this fantastic video with TotalBiscuit.

741
00:32:25,979 --> 00:32:28,721
And they're like, oh, awesome. The day that he released his video of our game

742
00:32:29,001 --> 00:32:30,462
was one of our biggest spikes in sales.

743
00:32:30,482 --> 00:32:32,804
And I'm like, oh, fuck. This is going to be such a mistake

744
00:32:33,444 --> 00:32:36,127
if this video goes out months before my game is released.

745
00:32:36,147 --> 00:32:37,327
People are just going to forget about it.

746
00:32:38,267 --> 00:32:41,108
So I sent him an email describing all of this, and I said,

747
00:32:41,148 --> 00:32:44,309
my game is so hard to explain, we've just made the best marketing material.

748
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:47,530
All these other people said this was always their biggest spike in sales.

749
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:50,011
Can you please hold this until the day that I release?

750
00:32:50,031 --> 00:32:51,612
And he said, we wouldn't normally do it for people,

751
00:32:51,972 --> 00:32:53,113
but we understand your problem.

752
00:32:53,213 --> 00:32:55,214
We agree it was a good video, so we'll hold it off for you.

753
00:32:57,655 --> 00:33:00,376
So this was like, I was then aiming for October.

754
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,336
I'd missed October.

755
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:02,717
I knew that December was totally out,

756
00:33:02,737 --> 00:33:05,038
because that's when the summer sales were probably going to happen,

757
00:33:05,058 --> 00:33:06,418
and they were a black hole if you're not in them.

758
00:33:07,649 --> 00:33:09,831
So I was like, alright, I have to release in November, I guess,

759
00:33:10,131 --> 00:33:11,492
because this had to come out in 2012.

760
00:33:12,813 --> 00:33:14,394
And so I spoke with my contact at Valve,

761
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:16,496
and I said, what are good dates in November?

762
00:33:16,516 --> 00:33:20,059
And he said, the week of the 5th, the 14th, and the 28th of November look really good.

763
00:33:20,639 --> 00:33:22,481
And so when I spoke with the Indie Fund about this...

764
00:33:23,809 --> 00:33:27,091
One of them said, well, Halo comes out on the 2nd.

765
00:33:27,312 --> 00:33:30,494
And you know, it's a console game, but you just want to be aware of that.

766
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:33,756
And so then I looked at the other dates, and the 14th was after Call of Duty,

767
00:33:34,216 --> 00:33:37,378
and Assassin's Creed was right near the 28th.

768
00:33:37,899 --> 00:33:39,780
And I thought, this is also going to be such a problem.

769
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:42,762
Yes, I'm just some indie game, and I'm not competing directly with those guys,

770
00:33:42,862 --> 00:33:45,084
but I'm ultimately going to be competing.

771
00:33:46,202 --> 00:33:50,224
for media attention. And if I release my game in amongst when everyone else is just talking

772
00:33:50,244 --> 00:33:54,647
about Halo and Call of Duty and Assassin's Creed, I will have spent years and then just

773
00:33:54,807 --> 00:33:59,069
throw it all away at the last minute. And at this stage I did not trust any of my own

774
00:33:59,109 --> 00:34:02,451
decision making, so I just spoke with the Indie Fund and I said, can you please just

775
00:34:02,531 --> 00:34:04,572
tell me what I should do? And this was the feedback I got.

776
00:34:06,115 --> 00:34:08,576
Nathan Vela said, wait until late January or early February.

777
00:34:08,596 --> 00:34:10,557
You'll make more revenue releasing at a good time

778
00:34:10,618 --> 00:34:11,778
than you will lose via the delay.

779
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,040
Ron Carmel said, delaying will also give you time to plan

780
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,321
and execute a launch PR plan.

781
00:34:17,394 --> 00:34:19,395
Alan Isaacson said, you've spent so many years on this,

782
00:34:19,855 --> 00:34:22,517
I think you want to give people some time to get ready for its final release.

783
00:34:22,558 --> 00:34:24,939
And Kelly Santiago said, Journey was on a similar schedule,

784
00:34:24,959 --> 00:34:28,022
and I think we really benefited from the added time to do a proper PR lead-up.

785
00:34:28,722 --> 00:34:29,643
So here was my answer.

786
00:34:30,163 --> 00:34:32,685
This was why I wanted these guys to be invested in the game.

787
00:34:33,046 --> 00:34:34,587
If for nothing else, if not for the funding,

788
00:34:34,687 --> 00:34:37,529
these were very smart people who had been through all of this before,

789
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:40,932
who could give me feedback like this at a time when I needed it most,

790
00:34:40,992 --> 00:34:42,173
and it was absolutely vital.

791
00:34:43,692 --> 00:34:47,454
So I took all of January 2013 to work on assets, the trailer,

792
00:34:47,494 --> 00:34:49,375
work out the pricing, release dates, et cetera.

793
00:34:49,615 --> 00:34:51,196
And I wanted to leave none of this to chance.

794
00:34:51,236 --> 00:34:52,496
I'm talking with developer friends.

795
00:34:52,556 --> 00:34:53,577
I'm talking with press friends.

796
00:34:53,617 --> 00:34:55,377
I'm talking with QA friends.

797
00:34:55,457 --> 00:34:58,039
Trying to leave nothing about this release to chance.

798
00:34:58,439 --> 00:35:00,400
And I was carefully coordinating release coverage

799
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,180
with as many people.

800
00:35:02,214 --> 00:35:04,858
as I could. I asked a friend from Polygon, I said,

801
00:35:04,878 --> 00:35:07,322
rather than relying on what Valve had said, I asked

802
00:35:07,382 --> 00:35:09,144
a friend from Polygon, I said, can you tell me

803
00:35:09,525 --> 00:35:12,069
when the release calendar is just dead? And he

804
00:35:12,129 --> 00:35:14,132
did this for me because he was a friend and

805
00:35:14,172 --> 00:35:14,813
someone that I knew.

806
00:35:15,876 --> 00:35:18,877
And he said, the middle of January and the end of January

807
00:35:19,378 --> 00:35:20,698
look pretty dead at the moment.

808
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:22,039
So I thought, this is fantastic.

809
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:23,820
I wanted to announce two weeks before anyway.

810
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,461
So I'm going to announce in the middle of January, when

811
00:35:26,501 --> 00:35:27,401
nothing else is around.

812
00:35:27,462 --> 00:35:28,902
And then I'm going to release at the end of January.

813
00:35:28,962 --> 00:35:31,563
Which meant that when I announced my release date,

814
00:35:31,844 --> 00:35:33,304
that was able to saturate the news.

815
00:35:33,825 --> 00:35:35,145
And that was all leading up to this.

816
00:35:36,386 --> 00:35:38,087
On the 30th of January, I released my

817
00:35:38,147 --> 00:35:39,247
Antechamber launch trailer.

818
00:35:40,325 --> 00:35:42,027
And I did this a day ahead of time because I thought,

819
00:35:42,647 --> 00:35:45,250
on the launch day, I'm going to have enough other coverage.

820
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:46,771
I'm probably going to have some YouTube streamers.

821
00:35:46,791 --> 00:35:48,473
I'm going to have the TotalBiscuit video.

822
00:35:48,493 --> 00:35:49,915
I'm going to get all of the, um...

823
00:35:50,945 --> 00:35:53,607
the views and stuff. So I thought, I'll release this a day early just to

824
00:35:53,967 --> 00:35:56,048
start winding up the hype cycle again.

825
00:35:56,528 --> 00:35:58,990
And because that went up, and because my Steam page went up,

826
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:00,971
Giant Bomb posted their Quick Look video.

827
00:36:01,311 --> 00:36:03,812
And because they posted that, Total Biscuits sent me an email saying,

828
00:36:03,852 --> 00:36:05,853
why is one of my competitors posting a video?

829
00:36:06,394 --> 00:36:08,114
And I'm like, oh, I'm so sorry, like I've messed up.

830
00:36:08,134 --> 00:36:10,256
And he's like, it's not your fault, you're not meant to know that, but...

831
00:36:11,142 --> 00:36:12,822
I'm sorry, I have to release this right now,

832
00:36:13,222 --> 00:36:14,763
if you want to get the views that you deserve.

833
00:36:15,783 --> 00:36:16,804
And this, in hindsight,

834
00:36:17,124 --> 00:36:18,644
ended up being a fantastic decision,

835
00:36:18,684 --> 00:36:20,865
because this was 14 hours before the game released,

836
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:23,046
and no one could step in at this stage and be like,

837
00:36:23,326 --> 00:36:24,687
you know, I played it, it wasn't very good,

838
00:36:25,007 --> 00:36:26,127
you know, there were going to be critics.

839
00:36:27,865 --> 00:36:32,388
And so that was 14 hours of the YouTube comments going absolutely crazy about this.

840
00:36:32,448 --> 00:36:35,470
And I was sending off keys to everyone. I sent like 40 keys to Mojang.

841
00:36:35,831 --> 00:36:38,112
I sent off keys to Penny Arcade. Just as many people as I could.

842
00:36:38,733 --> 00:36:40,434
And then Notch was posting about it a lot.

843
00:36:40,734 --> 00:36:44,777
And because of all of that, on January 31st, when I finally released,

844
00:36:44,797 --> 00:36:46,598
within the first hour, I was number one.

845
00:36:47,139 --> 00:36:49,741
Within 24 hours, I'd passed 25,000 sales.

846
00:36:50,181 --> 00:36:51,942
I had over 40 reviews from eight and nine.

847
00:36:52,282 --> 00:36:54,204
Some low ones, but I can't control that.

848
00:36:55,085 --> 00:36:56,145
I got lots of high profile.

849
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:59,250
YouTube coverage and non-stop Twitter discussion all week.

850
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:01,656
At this stage, the game just was completely out of my hands

851
00:37:01,696 --> 00:37:04,503
and it just absolutely, absolutely ran off.

852
00:37:06,252 --> 00:37:07,393
So let's get to some takeaways.

853
00:37:07,753 --> 00:37:09,314
Number one, none of this happened quickly.

854
00:37:09,775 --> 00:37:12,256
This slide was nine years of decision making,

855
00:37:12,356 --> 00:37:15,619
seven years of work, three years of obsession for one day.

856
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:17,740
And if you just look at this one day,

857
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,462
or when I won the IGF, or when an announcement was made,

858
00:37:20,822 --> 00:37:23,484
you're missing out on 2,500 other days

859
00:37:23,764 --> 00:37:24,825
that led to this thing.

860
00:37:24,845 --> 00:37:27,607
And I talk about this because all throughout

861
00:37:27,647 --> 00:37:29,328
the development, I would bang on about

862
00:37:29,428 --> 00:37:30,949
luck versus opportunity.

863
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:33,051
This whole presentation is opportunity,

864
00:37:33,091 --> 00:37:34,512
opportunity, opportunity, opportunity.

865
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:37,474
And from the outside, people are looking in saying,

866
00:37:37,794 --> 00:37:38,794
very, very lucky.

867
00:37:39,655 --> 00:37:41,136
And the reason I'm talking about this is,

868
00:37:41,236 --> 00:37:43,377
an example is the TotalBiscuit video that goes up.

869
00:37:43,417 --> 00:37:44,418
People look at that and they're like,

870
00:37:44,438 --> 00:37:47,279
oh, you're lucky that, you know, you got that TotalBiscuit video.

871
00:37:47,299 --> 00:37:49,321
And I'm like, what are you talking about?

872
00:37:49,341 --> 00:37:50,401
That was work, you know.

873
00:37:50,441 --> 00:37:53,003
That was three months earlier when I made this video

874
00:37:53,043 --> 00:37:56,085
and when I decided to, you know, get him to hold it off.

875
00:37:57,015 --> 00:37:59,656
And the concession here is that there was a little element of luck here.

876
00:37:59,996 --> 00:38:03,598
I could have been watching TotalBiscuit's tweet stream 24-7.

877
00:38:04,118 --> 00:38:06,239
And if this tweet doesn't go out, absolutely,

878
00:38:06,279 --> 00:38:08,680
the rest of the story, as I've just described, it does not happen.

879
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,841
But here's why that is completely irrelevant.

880
00:38:10,881 --> 00:38:12,821
This tweet is a very insignificant thing,

881
00:38:12,861 --> 00:38:14,702
and these kinds of things, these tweets,

882
00:38:14,762 --> 00:38:16,783
these random conversations that we have with people,

883
00:38:17,263 --> 00:38:20,044
are going by a thousand times a day, every single day.

884
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:23,971
That tweet went out to 250,000 people.

885
00:38:23,991 --> 00:38:26,532
That's how many followers he had at the time, minus retweets.

886
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:30,372
Of those 250,000 people, a smaller subset were developers.

887
00:38:30,693 --> 00:38:32,073
A smaller subset were going to PAX.

888
00:38:32,113 --> 00:38:33,773
A smaller subset had something ready to show.

889
00:38:33,793 --> 00:38:34,994
A smaller subset contacted him.

890
00:38:35,054 --> 00:38:36,274
A smaller subset recorded a video.

891
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:38,814
And a smaller subset recorded a very good video.

892
00:38:39,155 --> 00:38:41,115
And another tweet from TotalBiscuit several months

893
00:38:41,175 --> 00:38:43,696
later said, actually, most of the developer commentary

894
00:38:43,716 --> 00:38:46,696
videos that we record at shows like these are received very,

895
00:38:46,736 --> 00:38:49,177
very negatively because either the developers don't know how

896
00:38:49,197 --> 00:38:50,037
to talk about their game.

897
00:38:50,517 --> 00:38:53,658
or there's shaky cam footage, or people would just rather hear TotalBiscuit talk.

898
00:38:54,299 --> 00:38:57,500
He said, except for the antechamber video and another video.

899
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,001
And it's not luck that I happened to record a good video with TotalBiscuit,

900
00:39:01,261 --> 00:39:05,263
because prior to making that video, I had done nothing other than talk about my game

901
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:08,824
for three years to work out how to talk about it most effectively.

902
00:39:09,804 --> 00:39:12,125
And the other reason I'm talking about this is because...

903
00:39:13,027 --> 00:39:16,030
Luck and opportunity are talking about exactly the same thing.

904
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:17,912
Opportunity is future focused.

905
00:39:18,092 --> 00:39:19,173
These things can happen.

906
00:39:19,393 --> 00:39:20,754
Luck is always in hindsight.

907
00:39:20,995 --> 00:39:22,016
These things did happen.

908
00:39:22,196 --> 00:39:24,738
Once something happens, you don't need to continue looking for it again.

909
00:39:26,365 --> 00:39:28,986
which is why I talk about development philosophy so much.

910
00:39:29,386 --> 00:39:32,847
What I did is not actually the important part of the story.

911
00:39:33,067 --> 00:39:35,147
It's why I made all of these decisions,

912
00:39:35,227 --> 00:39:36,708
all of the strategy that went into it,

913
00:39:36,748 --> 00:39:39,208
looking at other successes and trying to analyze

914
00:39:39,248 --> 00:39:41,389
what all of them did so that I could work out

915
00:39:41,409 --> 00:39:44,089
what were the right decisions for my specific game.

916
00:39:44,169 --> 00:39:46,310
And doing this requires brutal self-awareness.

917
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:49,971
The reason that I was destroying myself doing this

918
00:39:50,091 --> 00:39:52,371
is because I was taking this to the absolute extreme.

919
00:39:52,871 --> 00:39:54,152
I did not care about my health.

920
00:39:54,292 --> 00:39:55,612
All I cared about was this game.

921
00:39:56,612 --> 00:40:00,055
And doing this brutal self-awareness means that you have to constantly question all of

922
00:40:00,075 --> 00:40:02,877
your assumptions and course correct all along the way.

923
00:40:03,277 --> 00:40:06,580
It's not that I didn't make mistakes, it's that I made a thousand mistakes, learned from

924
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,882
all of them, picked myself up and then corrected them before it was too late.

925
00:40:11,503 --> 00:40:13,506
And the other takeaway that I don't talk about much,

926
00:40:13,526 --> 00:40:15,509
that I didn't talk about much at all throughout the development,

927
00:40:15,609 --> 00:40:17,332
is that none of this happened in isolation.

928
00:40:17,912 --> 00:40:20,276
I understand spin, I understand talking with the press,

929
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:21,898
and so it was a really good story to say,

930
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:23,981
I'm the guy. Me. Me, me, me, me, me.

931
00:40:24,302 --> 00:40:26,225
All of these decisions, the successes and the failures,

932
00:40:26,245 --> 00:40:26,826
they're all on me.

933
00:40:27,547 --> 00:40:30,707
The reality is, although I would have done around 80-90% of the development,

934
00:40:30,768 --> 00:40:32,428
I absolutely could not have had the success

935
00:40:32,748 --> 00:40:35,429
without the sound design, the composition, the modeling, the illustration,

936
00:40:35,469 --> 00:40:39,450
and all the other people helping me with business acumen, and PR, and strategy, and testing.

937
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:42,011
Hundreds, if not thousands of other people

938
00:40:42,311 --> 00:40:44,772
were necessary to make this success happen.

939
00:40:44,852 --> 00:40:46,572
I did not make it in a bubble.

940
00:40:46,872 --> 00:40:48,613
And finally, making games is hard.

941
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:50,893
I don't look at any of this stuff.

942
00:40:51,193 --> 00:40:53,574
I don't look at independent development through rose-colored glasses.

943
00:40:53,614 --> 00:40:55,255
This is honestly the hardest thing that I've ever done.

944
00:40:56,228 --> 00:40:57,408
and it absolutely destroyed me.

945
00:40:57,948 --> 00:40:59,489
And the reason that I wanted to give this talk

946
00:40:59,689 --> 00:41:01,789
is so that people could see that, yes, this is very hard,

947
00:41:01,809 --> 00:41:04,370
and if you're struggling, that's what it takes sometimes.

948
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:06,610
There's a lot of people who are struggling about this in private.

949
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,830
I don't actually care about my public perception

950
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:11,051
because my public perception was being open and candid

951
00:41:11,091 --> 00:41:13,071
about all of this stuff the whole time.

952
00:41:13,531 --> 00:41:15,272
So I hope this talk has been inspiring,

953
00:41:15,632 --> 00:41:17,812
and if this all seems like something that you don't want to do,

954
00:41:17,872 --> 00:41:20,313
then I hope I've helped you make that decision as well.

955
00:41:22,393 --> 00:41:22,653
Thank you.

956
00:41:37,593 --> 00:41:42,196
Thank you.

957
00:41:50,743 --> 00:41:50,883
So.

958
00:41:52,081 --> 00:41:55,842
That was process, and I know that a number of you probably don't have main conference

959
00:41:55,862 --> 00:41:56,202
passes.

960
00:41:56,242 --> 00:42:00,583
If any of you do, tomorrow I'm presenting the other half of this, which is what I was

961
00:42:00,623 --> 00:42:03,504
actually doing with the design throughout all of those three years.

962
00:42:03,744 --> 00:42:07,145
So if you do have a main conference pass, you can come and see that tomorrow.

963
00:42:07,645 --> 00:42:11,206
And we're very early, but I needed more than 25 minutes, so thank you.

964
00:42:11,266 --> 00:42:15,186
And if there are any questions, I don't know if we're taking them or going off in the ready

965
00:42:15,226 --> 00:42:15,447
room.

966
00:42:16,207 --> 00:42:16,447
Matt?

967
00:42:18,367 --> 00:42:19,187
I can take some questions?

968
00:42:19,848 --> 00:42:20,108
Cool.

969
00:42:20,328 --> 00:42:20,748
Hey, Alexander.

970
00:42:20,768 --> 00:42:20,928
Hey, Matt.

971
00:42:21,842 --> 00:42:23,243
Hey Alexander, over here to your right.

972
00:42:24,804 --> 00:42:26,685
So you talked an awful lot and it was really awesome

973
00:42:26,725 --> 00:42:28,866
about how your personality and your PR strategy

974
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:32,088
and your iterations led to the success of your game.

975
00:42:32,268 --> 00:42:33,809
You only talked a little bit about how the nature

976
00:42:33,909 --> 00:42:35,930
of your game itself led to the success of the game.

977
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,491
Is there anything that you would sort of like

978
00:42:37,912 --> 00:42:43,575
in high concept add that like, on that point basically?

979
00:42:43,655 --> 00:42:47,397
Yes, this is what this next talk is about.

980
00:42:47,437 --> 00:42:49,078
There was way too much to talk about today.

981
00:42:51,315 --> 00:42:54,877
I had a lot of people who, like with the luck thing, would be looking at my game

982
00:42:56,117 --> 00:42:59,419
as I'm talking about chasing opportunities, as I'm talking about going through festivals and stuff.

983
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:02,100
And they'd be like, well yeah, but come on, you just had a good game.

984
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:06,221
But actually back in 2009, I didn't have a really good game.

985
00:43:06,642 --> 00:43:09,443
A lot of the feedback that I was getting on that version, it worked as a mod.

986
00:43:09,603 --> 00:43:10,543
It worked as a free mod.

987
00:43:10,923 --> 00:43:12,544
And it worked for things like Make Something Unreal.

988
00:43:12,564 --> 00:43:13,965
And it worked for things like Sense of Wonder Knight,

989
00:43:13,985 --> 00:43:17,586
which were looking for these really abstract, unconventional things.

990
00:43:17,626 --> 00:43:20,307
But when I decided to take that and turn it into a standalone thing,

991
00:43:22,096 --> 00:43:24,817
The feedback that I got from absolutely everyone was like,

992
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:28,138
I'm always lost, there's too many dead ends,

993
00:43:28,498 --> 00:43:31,259
I don't know where to go, puzzles should flash red if I can't do them,

994
00:43:31,419 --> 00:43:33,179
you know, the whole game should be restructured.

995
00:43:33,999 --> 00:43:35,360
And I had people asking this question,

996
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,660
when I'm trying to solve some of this stuff,

997
00:43:38,661 --> 00:43:41,441
they'd be like, yeah, but well, do you want to make something new,

998
00:43:41,781 --> 00:43:43,182
or do you want to make something that can sell?

999
00:43:43,402 --> 00:43:45,022
And I was like, no, I actually want both.

1000
00:43:45,622 --> 00:43:47,383
And so by going through things like E3,

1001
00:43:47,803 --> 00:43:49,163
and watching people play the game,

1002
00:43:50,097 --> 00:43:54,121
I was able to identify all of the issues that were coming up and that were problems,

1003
00:43:54,241 --> 00:43:57,484
and then just be spot-fixing them all, and then I'd put it in front of people again,

1004
00:43:57,504 --> 00:43:59,986
and I'd watch all of those things. I'd see what they thought was interesting.

1005
00:44:00,347 --> 00:44:02,629
I'd remove the parts they thought were uninteresting.

1006
00:44:02,649 --> 00:44:06,692
And part of my talk tomorrow is about designing this balance

1007
00:44:06,732 --> 00:44:09,175
between making something remarkable and making something commercial.

1008
00:44:10,283 --> 00:44:13,644
Ultimately, one of the takeaways there is that the further you decide to go

1009
00:44:14,204 --> 00:44:16,685
in the remarkable direction, away from what the industry supports,

1010
00:44:17,245 --> 00:44:20,567
the more work you have to do to bring it back and make people understand

1011
00:44:20,647 --> 00:44:22,968
why they should care about this thing, which is a lot of work.

1012
00:44:23,548 --> 00:44:26,349
But the flip side of that is that it's also a lot of work to start with something

1013
00:44:26,369 --> 00:44:29,570
that you think will be commercial because you're attacking a market that already exists.

1014
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:33,191
Now you need to do all of the work of proving why people should care about your game

1015
00:44:33,431 --> 00:44:36,152
more than some of these other games that have bigger marketing budgets,

1016
00:44:36,192 --> 00:44:38,313
that have executed things better, that have sequels to...

1017
00:44:38,853 --> 00:44:39,614
you know, things like that.

1018
00:44:39,654 --> 00:44:42,415
And so for me, it made sense to try and just push

1019
00:44:42,455 --> 00:44:45,316
in this remarkable direction and then work out

1020
00:44:45,536 --> 00:44:46,156
what I had to do there.

1021
00:44:46,176 --> 00:44:46,837
And I was doing it.

1022
00:44:47,297 --> 00:44:49,738
I brought up examples of Braid and World of Goo and Portal.

1023
00:44:49,818 --> 00:44:51,478
And I did that because they were also games

1024
00:44:51,538 --> 00:44:53,399
that happened to meet these balance.

1025
00:44:53,439 --> 00:44:55,860
And I wanted to understand not just what the games did,

1026
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:58,361
but what led them to making all of those decisions

1027
00:44:58,401 --> 00:44:59,201
and do the same thing.

1028
00:44:59,982 --> 00:45:00,662
That was great, man. Thanks.

1029
00:45:00,942 --> 00:45:01,202
Thank you.

1030
00:45:03,663 --> 00:45:04,623
Go ahead.

1031
00:45:05,604 --> 00:45:06,264
Was it worth it?

1032
00:45:10,494 --> 00:45:12,721
Honestly, for a long time,

1033
00:45:14,025 --> 00:45:15,169
the answer to that question was,

1034
00:45:15,229 --> 00:45:15,911
I'm not so sure.

1035
00:45:19,022 --> 00:45:21,565
I posted about how much of a success this thing was,

1036
00:45:22,105 --> 00:45:23,927
and one of the fastest lessons that you learn

1037
00:45:24,247 --> 00:45:26,490
is that having a large bank account does absolutely nothing

1038
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:27,671
to solve a lot of your problems,

1039
00:45:28,231 --> 00:45:30,754
and in fact it just gives you a hell of a lot more problems.

1040
00:45:30,814 --> 00:45:33,997
It affected relationships with a bunch of people.

1041
00:45:34,698 --> 00:45:38,021
I was obviously going through some pretty big mental issues

1042
00:45:38,061 --> 00:45:38,842
going through all of this,

1043
00:45:39,563 --> 00:45:41,505
and then when I'm talking with people,

1044
00:45:42,045 --> 00:45:43,547
if I'm not the kind of person that's always...

1045
00:45:44,726 --> 00:45:46,567
very candid and honest about my problems

1046
00:45:47,168 --> 00:45:49,770
and suddenly my problems revolve around money

1047
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:53,373
then you start getting people being like man I wish I had your problems and I'd be like

1048
00:45:53,873 --> 00:45:57,296
really like you want to be completely physically sick and have mental health issues and

1049
00:45:57,656 --> 00:45:59,378
be screaming at yourself in the mirror and

1050
00:45:59,618 --> 00:46:02,680
you know fuck up your relationship with people I don't know why the hell you would want that

1051
00:46:03,767 --> 00:46:06,631
But, you know, the fault isn't on them for that.

1052
00:46:06,671 --> 00:46:08,993
Obviously they can't understand these circumstances.

1053
00:46:09,053 --> 00:46:12,557
And so, what I decided to do, having gone through all of this,

1054
00:46:12,597 --> 00:46:13,578
and having struggled through this,

1055
00:46:13,858 --> 00:46:15,000
the answer now is obviously,

1056
00:46:16,261 --> 00:46:20,125
it took a long time, but I am now in a much better position.

1057
00:46:20,145 --> 00:46:21,547
I am in the position I wanted to be.

1058
00:46:22,610 --> 00:46:23,991
be in when I decided to do this.

1059
00:46:24,572 --> 00:46:26,753
But now when other people are releasing their games,

1060
00:46:27,254 --> 00:46:29,335
or when they do have these big successes,

1061
00:46:29,355 --> 00:46:32,037
I'm there day one to try and talk to them

1062
00:46:32,077 --> 00:46:33,078
and help them out and say,

1063
00:46:33,238 --> 00:46:35,080
this is what the future could be like for you,

1064
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:36,881
so they don't have to go through the same problems I did.

1065
00:46:37,722 --> 00:46:38,702
Thanks for all your honesty.

1066
00:46:41,524 --> 00:46:42,325
How did...

1067
00:46:43,006 --> 00:46:43,666
Me in the middle here.

1068
00:46:45,387 --> 00:46:47,509
How did you support yourself financially while doing this?

1069
00:46:48,227 --> 00:46:52,991
So I went into this with $17,000 in savings, and I had that, all of this is like five-year

1070
00:46:53,052 --> 00:46:53,632
plan stuff.

1071
00:46:54,193 --> 00:46:59,078
So when I was working in industry, I was just in, like a junior or an intern, whatever,

1072
00:46:59,538 --> 00:47:00,399
and I was on like a $28,000 salary.

1073
00:47:04,486 --> 00:47:08,671
Some of that would have gone into tax, and then I would have only spent about a couple of thousand dollars throughout that year,

1074
00:47:08,751 --> 00:47:11,634
thinking, I don't need any of this now, and I'm not very materialistic,

1075
00:47:11,674 --> 00:47:14,837
so I'm just going to put all of this in the bank, if I happen to need it one day.

1076
00:47:15,297 --> 00:47:17,399
So when I needed to go to things like Sense of Wonder Night,

1077
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:20,903
I just had this $17,000 there, that I could use.

1078
00:47:21,263 --> 00:47:23,085
And then when I got the money from Make Something Unreal,

1079
00:47:23,806 --> 00:47:27,049
that gave me another $25,000, so I could continue extending things out.

1080
00:47:27,964 --> 00:47:29,926
And then as I continued going through these competitions,

1081
00:47:30,646 --> 00:47:34,149
some of them came with money, but most of them came with, like, free booth space.

1082
00:47:34,189 --> 00:47:36,791
So I was never paying for most of my booths around all of this.

1083
00:47:37,571 --> 00:47:40,513
And being from Australia, there was also some government grants,

1084
00:47:40,553 --> 00:47:42,695
which weren't for, like, outright funding.

1085
00:47:42,715 --> 00:47:44,536
There were things like, if you go to an event

1086
00:47:44,916 --> 00:47:46,658
and you need to recoup some of your expenses,

1087
00:47:46,678 --> 00:47:49,300
you can get a grant that will recoup, like, $2,500.

1088
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:52,702
So, for example, when I went to the PAX 10 in 2011,

1089
00:47:53,082 --> 00:47:55,344
I was actually really out of money at that stage.

1090
00:47:56,750 --> 00:48:01,634
But going to that, it cost me $2,300 in flights,

1091
00:48:02,134 --> 00:48:04,536
and I spent $300 while I was there,

1092
00:48:05,237 --> 00:48:06,938
but I stayed with friends.

1093
00:48:06,978 --> 00:48:08,380
I always stayed with friends when I was traveling,

1094
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,001
because that means I don't have to pay for accommodation,

1095
00:48:10,381 --> 00:48:11,602
and I didn't have to pay for my booth,

1096
00:48:11,642 --> 00:48:12,603
because it was covered by packs.

1097
00:48:13,904 --> 00:48:17,625
which meant that I was able to then go to the government and recoup two and a half thousand dollars

1098
00:48:18,066 --> 00:48:21,487
in expenses, which happened to make that whole trip just completely free.

1099
00:48:22,027 --> 00:48:23,528
So I was being as frugal as I could.

1100
00:48:23,548 --> 00:48:27,109
I was also living at home with parents, which kept my burn rate very low.

1101
00:48:27,649 --> 00:48:29,970
And I understand that, you know, not everyone is in that position,

1102
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:34,052
but honestly, funding is one of the most solved problems in independent development.

1103
00:48:34,072 --> 00:48:35,792
You can go to publishers, you can get kickstarted.

1104
00:48:35,812 --> 00:48:38,713
There is government grants, there is, you know, private, private funding.

1105
00:48:38,773 --> 00:48:39,594
There's pre-orders, etc.

1106
00:48:40,634 --> 00:48:41,915
If people look at funding and say,

1107
00:48:41,935 --> 00:48:43,075
oh, but you just lived with parents,

1108
00:48:43,095 --> 00:48:45,216
that was an active decision on my behalf

1109
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:47,037
to stay doing that to keep my burn rate very low.

1110
00:48:47,057 --> 00:48:48,498
Thank you much.

1111
00:48:51,439 --> 00:48:53,080
Um, so my question is,

1112
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:56,382
uh, you talk about how, um, a lot of the promotion

1113
00:48:56,802 --> 00:48:57,642
and, like, meeting people,

1114
00:48:57,682 --> 00:48:59,243
you had to go to all these conferences,

1115
00:48:59,583 --> 00:49:01,324
um, and festivals and everything.

1116
00:49:01,404 --> 00:49:03,345
I wanted to know how you were able to structure

1117
00:49:03,365 --> 00:49:05,947
your, uh, development cycle around that

1118
00:49:06,067 --> 00:49:08,488
so that it didn't really mess with, um...

1119
00:49:09,225 --> 00:49:12,406
you didn't go away for a week and come back and that didn't really disrupt you.

1120
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:16,968
So the thing that festivals were solving is when I was just alone in my bedroom,

1121
00:49:17,448 --> 00:49:19,249
that's actually when things were the most difficult.

1122
00:49:19,569 --> 00:49:22,970
And every time I went off to a festival, I would be completely refreshed

1123
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:25,431
and I was still working the whole time.

1124
00:49:25,571 --> 00:49:28,052
I was networking, I was doing business, I was...

1125
00:49:29,818 --> 00:49:33,679
testing the game constantly and that was the most valuable work that I did and it's also

1126
00:49:33,719 --> 00:49:37,260
what refreshed my mental state so that then I could come back and work on the problems

1127
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:41,121
that were real problems, you know. After a couple of months you start thinking these

1128
00:49:41,141 --> 00:49:44,422
are the most significant problems, I really need to fix these things. You'd go to a festival

1129
00:49:44,442 --> 00:49:48,643
and realize actually none of that work matters, no one cares about any of that stuff. And

1130
00:49:48,663 --> 00:49:52,183
so it was also making me much more efficient because it stopped me working on things that

1131
00:49:52,543 --> 00:49:53,784
just didn't matter in the long run.

1132
00:49:58,057 --> 00:50:00,838
I'm not sure if you can talk about them or to the extent you can talk about them,

1133
00:50:01,018 --> 00:50:04,879
but from someone who went through a seven-year development cycle and had so many problems

1134
00:50:04,939 --> 00:50:08,840
and went through so much, where do you... I'm just curious, where do you go from here?

1135
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,462
You know, is it difficult to like think about having another seven-year development cycle,

1136
00:50:13,482 --> 00:50:18,844
have another game that, you know, is that difficult? What do you... what's your thoughts now?

1137
00:50:20,492 --> 00:50:23,673
This is part of why some of this was problematic.

1138
00:50:23,914 --> 00:50:25,074
You know, after releasing this,

1139
00:50:25,094 --> 00:50:26,235
a whole lot of people were like,

1140
00:50:26,355 --> 00:50:27,575
oh man, what are you going to work on next?

1141
00:50:27,635 --> 00:50:29,737
And I'm like, if this is how I feel

1142
00:50:30,177 --> 00:50:32,338
after the one that just pulled off absolutely everything,

1143
00:50:32,358 --> 00:50:34,239
I don't want to do this again.

1144
00:50:34,259 --> 00:50:36,100
You know, fuck that.

1145
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:36,560
And so...

1146
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:40,391
That lost all of my creative drive.

1147
00:50:40,972 --> 00:50:43,314
And if I was also doing this for the career drive,

1148
00:50:43,594 --> 00:50:45,495
and for like the financial side, and I've just solved that,

1149
00:50:45,535 --> 00:50:47,197
I lost all of my financial drive as well.

1150
00:50:47,977 --> 00:50:49,739
Which means that you've taken a very driven person

1151
00:50:49,779 --> 00:50:52,361
and you've removed any reason for them to have drive.

1152
00:50:52,441 --> 00:50:55,344
And honestly, that just took a whole lot of time.

1153
00:50:55,364 --> 00:50:56,925
It would have taken eight months

1154
00:50:56,985 --> 00:50:59,327
before I started becoming interested in anything again.

1155
00:50:59,387 --> 00:51:00,708
And that was something that I couldn't force.

1156
00:51:00,748 --> 00:51:02,009
I can't intensely problem-solve

1157
00:51:02,029 --> 00:51:03,230
being interested about the world.

1158
00:51:03,851 --> 00:51:04,351
I just have to...

1159
00:51:05,612 --> 00:51:07,914
I just had to live more existentially day to day

1160
00:51:08,194 --> 00:51:09,675
and just find other things that would interest me.

1161
00:51:10,296 --> 00:51:12,297
Thank you. You're welcome.

1162
00:51:12,357 --> 00:51:13,859
Hey, Alex. I'm Hamish.

1163
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:16,601
My question is, what...

1164
00:51:16,961 --> 00:51:18,502
and you might be addressing this tomorrow,

1165
00:51:18,522 --> 00:51:19,783
but I feel like I have to know now.

1166
00:51:20,184 --> 00:51:22,406
What percentage of your development time

1167
00:51:22,446 --> 00:51:24,848
were you spending on this kind of stuff,

1168
00:51:24,888 --> 00:51:25,928
on marketing, basically?

1169
00:51:26,429 --> 00:51:28,971
On marketing and testing? So I would have gone through...

1170
00:51:28,991 --> 00:51:29,711
No, just marketing.

1171
00:51:31,867 --> 00:51:33,369
they were kind of the same.

1172
00:51:33,389 --> 00:51:36,172
Like, going to events was testing as well.

1173
00:51:36,432 --> 00:51:37,754
So, on marketing and stuff.

1174
00:51:37,774 --> 00:51:39,075
So, it was primarily through events.

1175
00:51:39,415 --> 00:51:41,137
So, I went through like 15 to 20 events

1176
00:51:41,658 --> 00:51:43,800
before I'd released the game.

1177
00:51:43,881 --> 00:51:47,064
And that, those things are only very short bursts.

1178
00:51:47,124 --> 00:51:49,146
Maybe they're three days, maybe they're a week.

1179
00:51:50,157 --> 00:51:52,939
And then between all of those, I was just straight back on the development.

1180
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:56,901
And as I was submitting builds to festivals,

1181
00:51:57,301 --> 00:51:59,002
then I would have to do a little bit more work,

1182
00:51:59,062 --> 00:52:01,563
then, on, like, information about the game,

1183
00:52:01,883 --> 00:52:03,924
and I'd have to be sending out press releases and stuff.

1184
00:52:03,964 --> 00:52:06,005
But those were all, like, you know, days here and there.

1185
00:52:06,386 --> 00:52:09,187
And most of them were just talking with people

1186
00:52:09,207 --> 00:52:11,028
that I'd already met around the place.

1187
00:52:11,448 --> 00:52:12,889
You know, some, like, I had a lot of,

1188
00:52:13,869 --> 00:52:15,130
I met a lot of people in the press.

1189
00:52:15,350 --> 00:52:17,491
And so I could just have a lot of candid conversations

1190
00:52:17,951 --> 00:52:19,272
off the record on things like Facebook.

1191
00:52:19,637 --> 00:52:22,017
with those people to work out what I was doing.

1192
00:52:22,317 --> 00:52:24,038
And so it was then much faster to work out

1193
00:52:24,098 --> 00:52:25,438
what kinds of assets I need.

1194
00:52:25,498 --> 00:52:27,758
And taking things like Rami's, you know, doPressKit,

1195
00:52:28,039 --> 00:52:30,539
I don't have to work out what a good press kit looks like.

1196
00:52:30,579 --> 00:52:33,020
I just take that and, you know, fill that out.

1197
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:35,120
So it was a long time

1198
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:37,161
because of all of the investment into festivals,

1199
00:52:37,701 --> 00:52:39,621
but most of the development while I was at home

1200
00:52:39,661 --> 00:52:40,701
was just pure development.

1201
00:52:41,622 --> 00:52:43,102
Thanks very much. And by the way,

1202
00:52:43,142 --> 00:52:44,422
your game was really, really good in 2009.

1203
00:52:44,462 --> 00:52:44,782
Thank you.

1204
00:52:49,812 --> 00:52:50,923
That's it. Thank you guys.
