1
00:00:12,506 --> 00:00:13,586
Well, hi everyone.

2
00:00:16,167 --> 00:00:18,048
Oh, an interactive group.

3
00:00:20,249 --> 00:00:23,870
Well, great to be talking live finally at an event.

4
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,211
I hope you guys are having a great GDC.

5
00:00:28,609 --> 00:00:30,512
just to make sure that you're in the right place.

6
00:00:31,393 --> 00:00:35,740
I'm going to be talking about challenging supercell sacred cows

7
00:00:36,641 --> 00:00:40,046
and the importance of evolving culture as you grow.

8
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:43,912
Just a little bit about supercell.

9
00:00:46,941 --> 00:00:50,122
We're probably best known for our five games,

10
00:00:50,662 --> 00:00:55,043
Clash of Clans, Boom Beach, Hay Day, Clash Royale.

11
00:00:55,684 --> 00:00:56,444
We're all stars.

12
00:00:56,844 --> 00:01:01,625
We have 250 million monthly players playing those games.

13
00:01:03,206 --> 00:01:07,047
We're also somewhat known for our game teams

14
00:01:07,707 --> 00:01:09,528
killing their beloved games

15
00:01:10,228 --> 00:01:13,429
when they just don't quite reach the experience

16
00:01:13,489 --> 00:01:16,110
that we want to create for our players around the world.

17
00:01:18,928 --> 00:01:23,309
So we're currently almost hitting 400 people from a headcount standpoint.

18
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:27,790
The majority of the people you'll see are based in Helsinki,

19
00:01:28,711 --> 00:01:31,991
where Supercell was founded and born.

20
00:01:33,652 --> 00:01:37,293
The games that you saw on the previous slide were all developed in Helsinki,

21
00:01:37,693 --> 00:01:40,573
but we now have game development happening in Shanghai,

22
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:46,155
and our latest news was that we're opening up a North American studio.

23
00:01:49,858 --> 00:01:58,285
And our why, our dream, is to create great games that as many people as possible play

24
00:01:58,325 --> 00:02:00,367
for years and remembered forever.

25
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,592
So now for the most important part of the talk.

26
00:02:06,472 --> 00:02:07,333
You know, who am I?

27
00:02:09,374 --> 00:02:13,336
I don't know if you can tell from my accent, which is a little bit mixed up these days,

28
00:02:13,456 --> 00:02:22,019
but originally from England, started in gaming actually in the mid-80s, and was one of the

29
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:25,220
people to launch Electronic Arts in Europe.

30
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:32,883
I then found myself at Electronic Arts in the US, was VP of Marketing there, and then

31
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:38,425
went on to found, or co-found, Pogo, a web game startup.

32
00:02:39,085 --> 00:02:42,446
which of course was then acquired by Electronic Arts.

33
00:02:42,806 --> 00:02:45,786
So went back there for a while longer.

34
00:02:47,447 --> 00:02:49,507
Have to admit, I had a couple of my own

35
00:02:49,667 --> 00:02:51,788
failed gaming startups,

36
00:02:52,488 --> 00:02:54,829
and so I took a little bit of a detour for a while

37
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:58,030
to explore actually being outside of gaming,

38
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:01,030
and went into philanthropy,

39
00:03:01,731 --> 00:03:02,571
and I ended up...

40
00:03:03,432 --> 00:03:06,774
coming back to gaming and coming to Supercell

41
00:03:07,434 --> 00:03:10,595
to launch our philanthropic efforts.

42
00:03:11,555 --> 00:03:12,976
And that's what I do now,

43
00:03:13,936 --> 00:03:15,917
but I've also worn many other hats,

44
00:03:16,698 --> 00:03:18,758
and I'm really happy and proud right now

45
00:03:18,858 --> 00:03:23,660
to be our first co-chief people officer at Supercell,

46
00:03:24,421 --> 00:03:28,322
along with my fabulous partner in crime,

47
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:30,003
Frida Johansson.

48
00:03:30,763 --> 00:03:31,203
Hi, Frida.

49
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:36,141
So let's just talk more about culture.

50
00:03:37,502 --> 00:03:40,063
You may have seen the next couple of slides.

51
00:03:40,784 --> 00:03:42,325
If you've seen any of our talks,

52
00:03:43,065 --> 00:03:44,506
we've talked about this before,

53
00:03:44,787 --> 00:03:47,909
but the traditional model of operating a company

54
00:03:48,509 --> 00:03:51,772
is where you have a few leaders at the top

55
00:03:52,372 --> 00:03:55,014
who are creating the vision for teams,

56
00:03:55,094 --> 00:03:58,876
who are telling the teams what they should be doing,

57
00:03:59,317 --> 00:04:01,578
and then the teams are the ones that execute on that.

58
00:04:03,892 --> 00:04:09,074
The Supercell model from the beginning has been a little bit different.

59
00:04:09,794 --> 00:04:12,915
We've tried to sort of flip this model upside down.

60
00:04:13,755 --> 00:04:17,956
And actually, it's the stars, the teams themselves, the games teams,

61
00:04:18,376 --> 00:04:20,317
who are making all of those decisions.

62
00:04:20,897 --> 00:04:23,077
The leadership, you know, all the management,

63
00:04:23,398 --> 00:04:28,659
are really there to help them focus on creating those great game experiences.

64
00:04:29,484 --> 00:04:33,826
It's not the only piece of our culture, but it's definitely at the heart of it,

65
00:04:34,286 --> 00:04:38,008
where teams get to be independently making these decisions

66
00:04:38,508 --> 00:04:42,410
without seeking approval from the outside or from leadership.

67
00:04:45,681 --> 00:04:47,742
So now let's talk about evolving culture.

68
00:04:48,383 --> 00:04:51,265
And I'll talk a little bit about why we think it's important,

69
00:04:52,246 --> 00:04:55,748
a little bit about our cultural journey as a company,

70
00:04:56,429 --> 00:05:00,632
and then also our sort of latest culture assessment

71
00:05:00,672 --> 00:05:02,253
that we did last year.

72
00:05:05,357 --> 00:05:09,979
So here's a quote that I used to attribute to Bilker

73
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:12,380
until I found out that he'd actually stolen it

74
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,201
from Marshall Goldsmith.

75
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:17,263
But it's something we talk about at Supercell.

76
00:05:17,523 --> 00:05:19,844
You know, what got you here won't get you there.

77
00:05:20,444 --> 00:05:22,805
The importance, again, of learning, evolving,

78
00:05:22,845 --> 00:05:24,106
and not getting stuck.

79
00:05:26,057 --> 00:05:32,763
And this is our most recent culture memo, which I'll talk to you a little bit later.

80
00:05:33,243 --> 00:05:38,768
But at the end there, you can see that we end the memo with, basically,

81
00:05:38,848 --> 00:05:44,132
culture is never done. And so that's something that we believe strongly in.

82
00:05:45,853 --> 00:05:48,736
So I'm going to take a little trip down memory lane here.

83
00:05:50,593 --> 00:05:53,055
The timeline starts in 2009.

84
00:05:53,856 --> 00:05:56,438
That was a year before Supercell was founded.

85
00:05:56,778 --> 00:05:58,960
And then the blue numbers are our headcount.

86
00:05:59,561 --> 00:06:01,342
And then obviously the game logos

87
00:06:01,422 --> 00:06:02,903
are when our game's launched.

88
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:08,167
So it was actually the year before Supercell was founded

89
00:06:08,187 --> 00:06:14,132
that Ilka, our CEO, came across the Netflix culture deck.

90
00:06:14,893 --> 00:06:17,735
And you probably have all read that by now,

91
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:19,396
but at the time it was quite new.

92
00:06:20,388 --> 00:06:27,210
And the crux of that was around freedom and independence and responsibility.

93
00:06:28,671 --> 00:06:34,132
And so Ilker thought about, you know, the deck itself at Netflix was very focused on

94
00:06:34,252 --> 00:06:36,152
individuals and how individuals work.

95
00:06:36,713 --> 00:06:40,974
And he thought, you know, this would be kind of a really interesting model for teams.

96
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:44,535
The other thing that...

97
00:06:45,851 --> 00:06:52,896
him and his founders when they founded Supercell in 2010 took from the Netflix deck was the

98
00:06:53,136 --> 00:06:58,479
statement or the idea that it's really the best people that make the best games.

99
00:07:01,341 --> 00:07:09,146
But the colossal mistake, and those are his words not mine, but his mistake was that he

100
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:14,570
just never wrote anything down at the very first holiday party at Supercell.

101
00:07:15,862 --> 00:07:21,423
He wanted to talk about culture, and so he just presented the actual Netflix culture deck.

102
00:07:23,044 --> 00:07:29,685
But it was in 2012 where he was hanging out with a bunch of early Super Salians,

103
00:07:30,465 --> 00:07:32,406
and they were talking about responsibility,

104
00:07:33,246 --> 00:07:38,847
and he realized that everyone had slightly different interpretations of what that word actually meant.

105
00:07:39,787 --> 00:07:42,708
So that was the time where he thought, you know what,

106
00:07:42,748 --> 00:07:46,289
I've got to start to put this on top of the to-do list.

107
00:07:47,529 --> 00:07:51,670
And at this time, he did a lot of one-on-ones

108
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:54,011
with all the people in the company at that point

109
00:07:54,091 --> 00:07:56,012
to really just trying to get an understanding

110
00:07:56,192 --> 00:07:59,173
of what the values of the company should be.

111
00:08:01,053 --> 00:08:02,954
But it did take another couple of years

112
00:08:03,114 --> 00:08:05,775
until there was an actual, sort of official

113
00:08:06,035 --> 00:08:07,275
supercell culture deck.

114
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,981
which focused around the best people,

115
00:08:11,201 --> 00:08:14,163
how they work together, and our purpose.

116
00:08:15,563 --> 00:08:18,105
And this deck was presented at an off-site.

117
00:08:18,285 --> 00:08:21,007
It was really, really full of great content,

118
00:08:22,147 --> 00:08:25,289
but in many ways, just far too much content.

119
00:08:27,751 --> 00:08:30,873
So what then was realized through the years

120
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,914
is that it was so rich in content

121
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,295
that no one really could remember very much from it.

122
00:08:37,425 --> 00:08:41,127
So then we kind of went to the other side and decided, well,

123
00:08:41,147 --> 00:08:42,868
we need to streamline that content.

124
00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:47,270
And so that was another mistake, perhaps not as important

125
00:08:47,451 --> 00:08:49,312
as the one of not writing it down.

126
00:08:50,152 --> 00:08:51,493
But that was the next mistake.

127
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:55,415
But during this particular cultural assessment,

128
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:57,756
there were a few good things that actually

129
00:08:57,796 --> 00:08:59,897
came out of that process.

130
00:09:02,633 --> 00:09:05,375
So I mentioned earlier that we had taken that statement

131
00:09:05,556 --> 00:09:09,398
around sort of the best people make the best games.

132
00:09:10,099 --> 00:09:12,420
And that was something that we talked a lot about

133
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,161
in the company.

134
00:09:14,202 --> 00:09:16,724
But we then came to that realization of the years

135
00:09:16,744 --> 00:09:21,487
that it isn't necessarily the best people

136
00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:23,208
that make the best games.

137
00:09:23,348 --> 00:09:25,270
It's really the best teams.

138
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:29,312
And it's how great people work together within a team.

139
00:09:30,197 --> 00:09:32,638
So it was a fundamental shift in our thinking.

140
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,681
The other thing that we did during that cultural assessment

141
00:09:37,982 --> 00:09:40,844
was write down for the first time our dream

142
00:09:41,124 --> 00:09:42,365
and the mission of the company.

143
00:09:43,205 --> 00:09:45,927
And then we organized our thinking about

144
00:09:46,287 --> 00:09:49,449
what did we need to do to actually pursue that dream.

145
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:54,652
And so that was looking more into the best people,

146
00:09:54,692 --> 00:09:57,774
the best teams, and the best culture or environment

147
00:09:57,855 --> 00:09:59,896
to support our dream.

148
00:10:02,523 --> 00:10:11,168
So back to our mistake where we basically sort of streamlined everything with all good intentions,

149
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:15,351
but we ended up with sort of short catchphrases for things.

150
00:10:16,552 --> 00:10:19,774
Perhaps the best example is supercell first.

151
00:10:21,175 --> 00:10:26,759
And understandably, people interpreted that in many different ways, you know,

152
00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:31,902
and some people interpreted it as supercell above anything else.

153
00:10:32,689 --> 00:10:35,191
personal lives and personal well-being.

154
00:10:35,231 --> 00:10:37,532
And that obviously wasn't the intention behind that.

155
00:10:38,353 --> 00:10:40,714
It was more to say in an environment

156
00:10:40,854 --> 00:10:44,016
where we're heavily focused on teams,

157
00:10:44,857 --> 00:10:49,800
just to give some indication and help

158
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,641
as to how teams can work together.

159
00:10:51,661 --> 00:10:58,466
Oops.

160
00:11:00,357 --> 00:11:03,365
So that led us to, in 2019, our first culture memo.

161
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:15,785
And the difference there was we decided that we did need to put a little bit more material into our culture deck,

162
00:11:16,526 --> 00:11:20,548
and we moved it to this format of a memo, which was meant to be read.

163
00:11:20,728 --> 00:11:24,171
The deck is more for perhaps presentation purposes only,

164
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:30,495
but the memo meant that we could include a lot more information there around different scenarios

165
00:11:30,595 --> 00:11:34,437
and how to think and behave in those scenarios.

166
00:11:36,351 --> 00:11:44,485
So finally, as I said last year, we went through probably our most exhaustive exercise of taking

167
00:11:44,766 --> 00:11:46,549
another look at our culture.

168
00:11:49,814 --> 00:11:53,758
Before I sort of go into that process that we went through,

169
00:11:53,778 --> 00:11:56,680
I thought this would just be interesting to share.

170
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,422
So at the beginning of 2021,

171
00:11:58,522 --> 00:12:02,125
when we kind of came back from our Christmas break,

172
00:12:02,725 --> 00:12:07,229
we had our first company update with Ilka

173
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:08,230
and he posed.

174
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:11,652
this very, you know, interesting, provocative,

175
00:12:12,312 --> 00:12:14,393
and actually really inspiring question

176
00:12:14,413 --> 00:12:18,695
about are our best days at Supercell behind us

177
00:12:19,315 --> 00:12:20,396
or are they ahead of us?

178
00:12:21,676 --> 00:12:25,298
And obviously we decided they're ahead of us,

179
00:12:26,198 --> 00:12:30,260
but it was a very interesting thing for all of us

180
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,121
as Supercellians to think about

181
00:12:32,841 --> 00:12:36,022
and also set the tone, I think, for 2021

182
00:12:36,843 --> 00:12:38,283
and even the culture assessment.

183
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:44,611
So looking at how we went ahead with this review,

184
00:12:46,151 --> 00:12:49,052
but just a few sort of learnings to start with.

185
00:12:49,972 --> 00:12:52,333
So one thing I think that is important,

186
00:12:52,413 --> 00:12:53,893
I mean, it might sound very obvious,

187
00:12:53,933 --> 00:12:56,114
but is to set a goal and to share it.

188
00:12:56,834 --> 00:12:59,194
We announced earlier in the year

189
00:12:59,254 --> 00:13:02,415
that we were gonna complete a cultural assessment

190
00:13:03,295 --> 00:13:03,875
within the year.

191
00:13:03,935 --> 00:13:05,036
We missed it by a month,

192
00:13:05,176 --> 00:13:07,736
but it was important enough kind of body of work

193
00:13:09,548 --> 00:13:11,030
to slip by a month.

194
00:13:12,311 --> 00:13:16,735
The other thing I would say is that just because we look at,

195
00:13:16,775 --> 00:13:19,037
we take a conscious effort every two to three years

196
00:13:19,097 --> 00:13:22,701
to look at our culture, we approach it

197
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:28,566
with looking at it from what can we improve as opposed

198
00:13:28,586 --> 00:13:31,229
to do we need to improve.

199
00:13:32,634 --> 00:13:37,342
And then as you're exploring, you know, perhaps your own culture assessments,

200
00:13:37,662 --> 00:13:41,789
you know, focus on sort of the actual usage and practices.

201
00:13:41,949 --> 00:13:45,475
At the end of the day, culture is about action and behaviors.

202
00:13:48,496 --> 00:13:52,478
So this is how we went about our culture assessment process.

203
00:13:53,539 --> 00:13:55,740
We started with some pre-group discussions

204
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,102
and they were small group discussions

205
00:13:58,202 --> 00:13:59,323
with the leadership team.

206
00:14:00,023 --> 00:14:02,564
We had some folks who'd been with the company

207
00:14:02,605 --> 00:14:05,206
for a really long time, people from game development.

208
00:14:05,606 --> 00:14:07,307
But we also brought in some people

209
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:08,608
that had only been with the company,

210
00:14:08,768 --> 00:14:10,109
perhaps for less than a year.

211
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,752
The most recent people that had read our culture memo

212
00:14:14,852 --> 00:14:16,433
and wanted to just make sure,

213
00:14:17,513 --> 00:14:21,935
you know, were we living what they had read earlier in the year.

214
00:14:23,236 --> 00:14:25,616
The second thing we did was a company-wide survey

215
00:14:26,337 --> 00:14:30,118
and then after that we had these deep dive focus groups

216
00:14:30,698 --> 00:14:33,939
and then the end result was a revised culture memo.

217
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:41,282
So the survey itself, it had just two simple questions.

218
00:14:42,192 --> 00:14:47,895
And then the first one here was, you know, what do you love about our culture that you would never want to change?

219
00:14:49,295 --> 00:14:53,457
And you can see the different themes here that jumped out.

220
00:14:54,878 --> 00:15:03,382
Many of them are the ones that I've been sort of talking about that have been core to our culture and the way that we operate from the beginning.

221
00:15:03,662 --> 00:15:07,143
So, you know, independence, trust, freedom, responsibility.

222
00:15:10,016 --> 00:15:13,439
The second question that we asked was,

223
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:18,684
what needs to change so that you can do your best work

224
00:15:19,224 --> 00:15:20,045
at Supercell?

225
00:15:21,486 --> 00:15:25,450
And some of the themes there you'll see are communication.

226
00:15:26,691 --> 00:15:28,773
Some people said nothing needed to change.

227
00:15:30,334 --> 00:15:33,057
Discussions around mental health, the role,

228
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:36,020
evolving role of the lead at Supercell.

229
00:15:38,048 --> 00:15:40,770
So then we jumped into these deep dive discussions.

230
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,751
We used an external party for that.

231
00:15:43,451 --> 00:15:46,453
And we had 11 groups, and about a quarter of the company

232
00:15:46,493 --> 00:15:47,293
participated.

233
00:15:47,733 --> 00:15:51,175
They self-selected to join a topic that

234
00:15:51,355 --> 00:15:52,455
was interesting to them.

235
00:15:52,475 --> 00:15:56,898
And you'll see there, we touched on some of the topics

236
00:15:56,998 --> 00:16:00,039
around where people thought we could

237
00:16:00,119 --> 00:16:02,680
change in order to improve people's work

238
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,741
lives at Supercell.

239
00:16:04,221 --> 00:16:07,163
But we also did some groups that would focus on our strengths.

240
00:16:08,346 --> 00:16:15,410
and how can we take these things like independence and trust and how can we build on them and be even stronger.

241
00:16:18,532 --> 00:16:26,937
So that led us to that exhaustive process of about eight months led us to a new culture memo.

242
00:16:28,272 --> 00:16:36,074
And sort of no surprise, what didn't change in the culture memo was a lot of the meat

243
00:16:36,154 --> 00:16:37,975
and the heart of Supercell.

244
00:16:38,515 --> 00:16:39,896
Our mission stayed the same.

245
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:45,977
The traits around independence, responsibility, trust, et cetera, stayed the same.

246
00:16:48,418 --> 00:16:54,059
But there were some new things within the memo, and some things that perhaps were there

247
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,780
before but were highlighted a little bit more.

248
00:16:58,002 --> 00:17:01,966
So the first one is what we call internally the improvement mindset.

249
00:17:02,966 --> 00:17:07,430
And, you know, if you're familiar with Carol Dweck's book Mindset,

250
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:10,273
around the growth mindset, it's the same concept.

251
00:17:10,913 --> 00:17:13,015
You know, how can we continue to improve?

252
00:17:13,095 --> 00:17:15,057
How can we learn daily?

253
00:17:15,217 --> 00:17:19,460
How can we be more open to risks and new ideas?

254
00:17:20,001 --> 00:17:25,185
And how can we really think about making our games better every day?

255
00:17:27,027 --> 00:17:33,071
Another theme that we really introduced a little bit more front and center in the memo

256
00:17:33,171 --> 00:17:35,172
was around mental health and well-being.

257
00:17:36,177 --> 00:17:44,000
And I think the shift there for us was more less about the individual and the responsibilities

258
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:50,743
of the individual, but really what's at the root of mental health and well-being challenges

259
00:17:50,983 --> 00:17:56,966
and where's Supercell's role in that and where do teams play in that, and really encouraging

260
00:17:57,486 --> 00:18:01,868
teams to sit down and discuss this topic at that team level.

261
00:18:04,024 --> 00:18:08,506
sort of connected with this was a discussion around healthy team size.

262
00:18:09,407 --> 00:18:14,570
So, you know, Supercell, part of our identity has been small teams and it

263
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:19,454
still is small teams in comparison to many, many other companies.

264
00:18:20,214 --> 00:18:23,256
But I think what we learned is that one size doesn't fit all

265
00:18:23,877 --> 00:18:30,561
and there's different team situations, stages of development where we might

266
00:18:31,081 --> 00:18:32,762
need to look through different lenses.

267
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:38,866
So, you know, for a new game, two to five people, that makes a lot of sense.

268
00:18:39,026 --> 00:18:44,267
But as we're getting to beta games and live games, we wanted to introduce other lenses.

269
00:18:44,587 --> 00:18:47,808
So one being, what's the ambition that we want for our players?

270
00:18:48,408 --> 00:18:53,169
You know, what do we want to deliver to support our player community?

271
00:18:53,869 --> 00:18:58,630
And then the second lens also being, you know, what do we need to do to make sure that we are

272
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:03,211
creating the healthiest work experiences for our supercellians?

273
00:19:07,649 --> 00:19:08,109
Oops, sorry.

274
00:19:08,909 --> 00:19:12,110
The final one was, again, just highlighting

275
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:15,371
a little bit more the concept of inclusion and belonging.

276
00:19:16,251 --> 00:19:20,033
It's something that we think is core to high-performing teams,

277
00:19:20,613 --> 00:19:25,935
creating that open, safe environment where ideas

278
00:19:26,095 --> 00:19:28,976
are heard and it doesn't matter who says them.

279
00:19:32,657 --> 00:19:35,178
So this is sort of the final.

280
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:41,930
delivery I guess of the culture memo. So this is Greg Harper, he's our GM at the International

281
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:50,097
Offices and he presented a company update and shortly after that we published the memo.

282
00:19:50,838 --> 00:19:56,203
But I wanted to just add as well that Ilker, our CEO, immediately jumped onto Slack and

283
00:19:57,221 --> 00:19:59,822
was asking, you know, what's missing?

284
00:20:00,062 --> 00:20:01,762
You know, what do you guys think about this?

285
00:20:02,322 --> 00:20:04,563
Are there things on this piece of paper,

286
00:20:04,643 --> 00:20:06,863
these words that you're not seeing in action

287
00:20:07,483 --> 00:20:09,564
that you think where we can be better?

288
00:20:09,884 --> 00:20:12,285
And I bring it up in the concept of learning,

289
00:20:12,885 --> 00:20:15,906
and that learning process started from, you know,

290
00:20:15,986 --> 00:20:18,826
sort of day one of publishing this memo.

291
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,668
So some of the key lessons that I just wanted to highlight.

292
00:20:26,077 --> 00:20:33,160
Again, start early, write it down, you know, especially amongst if there's, you know, founders

293
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:38,883
out there who are just starting off, there is always something perhaps else to do, but it's so

294
00:20:38,983 --> 00:20:46,586
important. You know, set goals and listen hard, listen hard to your teams. What are you hearing

295
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:46,986
from them?

296
00:20:48,734 --> 00:20:55,719
challenge your sacred cows. That can be very, very difficult, I think, you know, very sensitive

297
00:20:55,779 --> 00:21:03,144
and very brave thing to do. And then again, as I said, it's about actions. It's not about

298
00:21:03,585 --> 00:21:09,969
presentations and decks and memos. And another thing that's super powerful, I think, is when

299
00:21:10,009 --> 00:21:15,773
you see culture in action to, you know, share that and broadcast it.

300
00:21:20,766 --> 00:21:25,792
So just to end here on, you know, culture is never done.

301
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:32,100
You know, we think it will continue to evolve at Supercell.

302
00:21:32,741 --> 00:21:35,604
We believe that we will continue to learn,

303
00:21:36,025 --> 00:21:37,947
and so our culture will evolve.

304
00:21:41,576 --> 00:21:44,438
So that's the end of my talk.

305
00:21:45,518 --> 00:21:48,520
This is a sort of shameless plug for my other gig

306
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,842
where I run the social impact, but just

307
00:21:50,882 --> 00:21:53,943
wanted to use this opportunity if you were interested.

308
00:21:54,043 --> 00:21:59,927
So we've donated, as a company, a million euros to the UNHCR.

309
00:22:00,392 --> 00:22:03,673
for Ukrainian refugees, but we also set up a fundraiser

310
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:07,796
for others to donate through that and we'll match it.

311
00:22:08,336 --> 00:22:11,037
So we'll match individual donations,

312
00:22:11,158 --> 00:22:14,239
but we've also worked with some other small studios

313
00:22:14,259 --> 00:22:17,681
that if they want to make a donation, we'll match that.

314
00:22:20,903 --> 00:22:22,944
And thank you for coming.

315
00:22:23,904 --> 00:22:26,306
If you have any questions, Brian's here.

316
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:44,797
Hello, Philip from Okto.

317
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:45,798
Hello.

318
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:50,822
Regarding COVID, have you seen any challenge in keeping the culture

319
00:22:52,424 --> 00:22:54,126
and related to remote work?

320
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:58,870
And the second question, I see you have many offices around the globe.

321
00:22:59,871 --> 00:23:03,034
Can you have the same culture in these different countries?

322
00:23:04,035 --> 00:23:07,418
Yeah. Yeah, they're both great questions.

323
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:16,626
Yeah, sure, I think, you know, COVID's been as challenging for Supercell as other companies.

324
00:23:18,127 --> 00:23:24,513
But I think that given that we have, it's been helpful having such a strong culture

325
00:23:24,933 --> 00:23:25,694
to start with.

326
00:23:26,454 --> 00:23:28,536
And I think we've, you know.

327
00:23:29,457 --> 00:23:34,821
one has to over communicate in an area where we have very little connection.

328
00:23:35,241 --> 00:23:38,683
So just doing our very best like others.

329
00:23:39,544 --> 00:23:42,626
It has been challenging, I think, for, you know, of course,

330
00:23:42,706 --> 00:23:47,009
we've had a lot of people join during COVID and we haven't met each other.

331
00:23:47,029 --> 00:23:50,592
I'm looking forward for that to happen.

332
00:23:50,652 --> 00:23:54,154
But I think just starting with that core culture

333
00:23:54,374 --> 00:23:58,958
and then having more of a habit of being over communicative has been helpful.

334
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:09,084
And to your second question, yeah, it is an interesting one, but I think that, I think

335
00:24:09,505 --> 00:24:15,711
our core culture, which I've made pretty clear, is around the concept of independent teams.

336
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:17,409
you know, works everywhere.

337
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:20,992
And certainly they may be slightly, you know,

338
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:23,714
different nuances with, you know,

339
00:24:23,774 --> 00:24:26,977
our culture in Shanghai or even in San Francisco.

340
00:24:27,197 --> 00:24:29,439
But I think at its core, you know,

341
00:24:29,539 --> 00:24:32,781
we hire people that are excited

342
00:24:32,861 --> 00:24:34,463
about being part of that culture.

343
00:24:35,043 --> 00:24:37,165
And I think it's something that we can hang on to

344
00:24:37,205 --> 00:24:38,166
in all of our offices.

345
00:24:41,879 --> 00:25:03,086
Hi. Thank you. Very interesting process. It seems like a bit of a daunting process. I was wondering if on a team basis you have practices like I know with some of my teams we have been doing you know every week as we discuss not just the project but you know at the end we always discuss like

346
00:25:03,975 --> 00:25:05,276
How are we working together?

347
00:25:05,296 --> 00:25:06,276
What is working?

348
00:25:06,316 --> 00:25:07,157
What is not working?

349
00:25:07,277 --> 00:25:09,778
What is one thing we can change next week?

350
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:13,341
And try it, and then iterate.

351
00:25:13,541 --> 00:25:16,623
So are your teams also constantly

352
00:25:16,923 --> 00:25:18,684
revising their own culture?

353
00:25:19,204 --> 00:25:21,966
Because yeah, at the company level, it's a huge task.

354
00:25:22,046 --> 00:25:25,268
But do you have any micro, regenerative?

355
00:25:26,787 --> 00:25:31,615
I think that's great what you're saying. It's sort of a good example of a sort of

356
00:25:31,675 --> 00:25:35,581
improvement mindset that we think is really important. One of the things that

357
00:25:35,821 --> 00:25:39,747
we've introduced recently in the Helsinki office is just

358
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:48,806
the process of teams sitting down and talking about that individually what ways they want

359
00:25:48,826 --> 00:25:51,989
to work and then collectively how does that sort of fit.

360
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:59,895
And I think that's just about becoming stronger as a team but it's also very helpful when

361
00:25:59,915 --> 00:26:06,981
we're talking about mentally healthy workplaces and having those conversations which perhaps

362
00:26:07,341 --> 00:26:08,602
haven't happened in the past.

363
00:26:11,432 --> 00:26:11,652
Thanks.

364
00:26:12,413 --> 00:26:12,813
Thank you.

365
00:26:17,058 --> 00:26:19,180
My name is Nikki and thank you so much

366
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,081
for this presentation.

367
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:22,924
It was really interesting and really exciting

368
00:26:22,944 --> 00:26:24,606
to also hear that Supercell,

369
00:26:25,287 --> 00:26:27,109
sort of this role model of a company that it is,

370
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:30,452
sort of also goes through these sort of culture evolutions

371
00:26:30,512 --> 00:26:31,874
and growing pains and things like that.

372
00:26:32,734 --> 00:26:35,296
And my question is more so regarding,

373
00:26:35,416 --> 00:26:37,898
you highlighted the focus and desire

374
00:26:37,918 --> 00:26:40,459
from a cultural level on more risk-taking

375
00:26:40,499 --> 00:26:41,200
and things like that.

376
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,042
I'd love for you to sort of dive a little bit more

377
00:26:44,082 --> 00:26:45,963
into detail about that in particular,

378
00:26:46,043 --> 00:26:48,865
just because again, Supercell being a role model,

379
00:26:50,105 --> 00:26:51,546
from the outside looking in,

380
00:26:51,606 --> 00:26:54,448
it seems like you guys have like this great system

381
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:55,789
of really intimate teams.

382
00:26:56,489 --> 00:27:00,031
having that independence to be able to take that risk-taking and that you guys

383
00:27:00,091 --> 00:27:01,032
aren't afraid to

384
00:27:01,972 --> 00:27:05,635
sort of kill projects that aren't quite hitting the notes that you wanted.

385
00:27:06,175 --> 00:27:09,317
So just to learn a little bit more about, yeah, your guys' struggle with

386
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:12,158
risk-taking and for us to learn a little bit more.

387
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,561
Yeah, I think, again,

388
00:27:16,581 --> 00:27:20,503
as you said, it's sort of been core to our culture

389
00:27:20,563 --> 00:27:24,205
from the very beginning that, you know,

390
00:27:25,712 --> 00:27:30,536
quality was one of our earlier values and what does a quality experience look like.

391
00:27:30,676 --> 00:27:37,681
So empowering our teams to make decisions about that, so you know all of those decisions being in

392
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:46,608
the in the team model. Also you know and I think part of our introducing the concept of the

393
00:27:46,668 --> 00:27:51,432
improvement mindset and Ilka's talk to us about you know the best days behind her head is.

394
00:27:51,992 --> 00:27:57,937
how can we be better about that and how can we be better both individually sort of challenging

395
00:27:58,017 --> 00:28:04,062
ourselves on a daily basis as well as within a team being perhaps a little bit more diligent

396
00:28:04,283 --> 00:28:08,907
about that improvement mindset. Awesome, thank you so much.

397
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:13,751
When you define the

398
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:19,635
culture, you're writing the memo, do you ever get resistance, people who disagree?

399
00:28:19,695 --> 00:28:22,318
And like, how do you work through that if there is any?

400
00:28:23,019 --> 00:28:24,100
No one ever disagrees.

401
00:28:24,841 --> 00:28:27,464
Are you being serious?

402
00:28:28,104 --> 00:28:29,206
No, I'm not. Sorry.

403
00:28:30,387 --> 00:28:32,109
It's my British sense of humor.

404
00:28:34,772 --> 00:28:35,693
Yeah, sure, people.

405
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:44,593
I mean you can just see from the process that we went through with, you know, sort of between

406
00:28:44,633 --> 00:28:52,263
2019 and 2021, clearly there were areas where we weren't necessarily perhaps living up to

407
00:28:52,283 --> 00:28:52,964
our culture.

408
00:28:54,872 --> 00:29:00,199
I think that we have a fairly, I mean we're still a fairly small company and people aren't

409
00:29:00,259 --> 00:29:07,789
shy about sharing if they have something that they disagree with and you know we encourage

410
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:08,971
those conversations.

411
00:29:09,151 --> 00:29:11,254
We'd rather have those things out in the open.

412
00:29:12,175 --> 00:29:17,458
sort of working through it and but the reality is as well we're clearly not

413
00:29:17,478 --> 00:29:23,922
going to be able to please you know everyone but the important thing I think

414
00:29:24,002 --> 00:29:30,246
is the core components that are truly supercell that make us special if we can

415
00:29:30,286 --> 00:29:35,849
be aligned there but you know also as a leadership team as well you know we'll

416
00:29:35,889 --> 00:29:36,249
take in

417
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:43,660
any of that information and have group discussions and figure out other areas where we need to

418
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,004
continue to grow.

419
00:29:48,622 --> 00:29:50,303
Hi, thanks a lot for the talk.

420
00:29:51,024 --> 00:29:51,744
Welcome.

421
00:29:51,804 --> 00:29:54,486
Netflix has this idea of talent density,

422
00:29:54,986 --> 00:29:58,568
which requires processes to let people go.

423
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:03,491
And does Supercell also have a similar culture

424
00:30:03,531 --> 00:30:07,394
and how do you deal with these moments

425
00:30:07,454 --> 00:30:10,176
or how do you deal with the talent density question?

426
00:30:12,537 --> 00:30:16,099
Yeah, I mean, of course there are,

427
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:16,840
when I think

428
00:30:17,388 --> 00:30:21,730
You know, Netflix and Supercell, well, there's many similarities.

429
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:25,612
I think there's different approaches to different things.

430
00:30:26,512 --> 00:30:29,494
And perhaps as a, you know, I've never worked at Netflix,

431
00:30:29,514 --> 00:30:32,815
so I can't really say, but on the outside, a little bit more perhaps a,

432
00:30:33,335 --> 00:30:35,556
you know, sort of direct.

433
00:30:36,457 --> 00:30:43,502
culture. You know, I would say on the Supercell side, it's pretty hard to get into Supercell.

434
00:30:43,642 --> 00:30:49,286
So we focus a lot on making sure that we are really attracting, you know, the best talent

435
00:30:50,167 --> 00:30:56,131
and put a lot of emphasis on that process. But, you know, like any company, you know,

436
00:30:56,552 --> 00:31:01,756
we might get it wrong or it might not be the fit. And, you know, we have those sort of

437
00:31:01,796 --> 00:31:02,816
difficult discussions.

438
00:31:11,681 --> 00:31:12,041
Okay.

439
00:31:15,903 --> 00:31:19,005
Well, I would just say I'll be around a little bit

440
00:31:19,125 --> 00:31:21,926
and we have a few other super salients here

441
00:31:22,006 --> 00:31:24,988
if you wanted to chat more on any of these topics.

442
00:31:26,168 --> 00:31:26,849
Thank you for coming.

443
00:31:27,169 --> 00:31:27,649
Thank you.

444
00:31:27,669 --> 00:31:28,809
Thank you.

445
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:31,671
Thank you.

446
00:31:31,691 --> 00:31:32,191
Thank you.

447
00:31:32,211 --> 00:31:32,511
Thank you.

448
00:31:32,531 --> 00:31:32,811
Thank you.

449
00:31:32,831 --> 00:31:33,092
Thank you.

450
00:31:33,112 --> 00:31:33,292
Thank you.

451
00:31:33,312 --> 00:31:33,572
Thank you.

452
00:31:33,592 --> 00:31:33,792
Thank you.

453
00:31:33,852 --> 00:31:34,052
Thank you.

454
00:31:34,132 --> 00:31:34,432
Thank you.

455
00:31:34,472 --> 00:31:34,732
Thank you.

456
00:31:34,752 --> 00:31:35,053
Thank you.

457
00:31:35,073 --> 00:31:35,253
Thank you.
