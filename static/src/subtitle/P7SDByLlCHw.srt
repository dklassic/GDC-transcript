1
00:00:07,561 --> 00:00:11,343
Cool, I'm up on my box now, and all of maybe five-four,

2
00:00:11,343 --> 00:00:13,304
so I think I'll go ahead and get started.

3
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:16,486
So my talk today is Don't Call Them Whales,

4
00:00:16,486 --> 00:00:18,627
Free-to-Place Vendors and Virtual Value.

5
00:00:20,542 --> 00:00:24,304
If you don't know me, I'm the CEO and co-founder of Kongregate.

6
00:00:24,304 --> 00:00:32,669
And if you don't know Kongregate, it is a, to start with, a browser, a web platform for

7
00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:34,950
browser games on the web.

8
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,931
So think YouTube for games.

9
00:00:36,931 --> 00:00:40,212
We get just a ton of content, about 1,300 new games.

10
00:00:41,273 --> 00:00:46,484
per month, 95,000 games total across a really wide variety of genres.

11
00:00:46,484 --> 00:00:51,976
And this gives us, with that ton of games, it gives us some interesting opportunities

12
00:00:51,976 --> 00:00:52,196
to do.

13
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,151
a lot of interesting research.

14
00:00:54,151 --> 00:00:57,191
And I am a big data geek, as you will discover quickly

15
00:00:57,191 --> 00:00:58,632
in this talk.

16
00:00:58,632 --> 00:01:02,153
So I think that's really fun.

17
00:01:02,153 --> 00:01:04,253
Most of the data in this talk will be from the web.

18
00:01:04,253 --> 00:01:06,114
But about 18 months ago, we started

19
00:01:06,114 --> 00:01:08,414
publishing games on mobile.

20
00:01:08,414 --> 00:01:11,295
And we've published about 15 games in that time period.

21
00:01:11,902 --> 00:01:14,384
Now that's not sort of the reach and breadth and depth

22
00:01:14,384 --> 00:01:15,545
of data we have from the web,

23
00:01:15,545 --> 00:01:17,006
but we've gotten more than 35 million installs

24
00:01:17,006 --> 00:01:18,387
and a bunch of titles in the top grossing.

25
00:01:18,387 --> 00:01:19,388
So there's a lot of interesting data there too.

26
00:01:19,388 --> 00:01:19,508
So,

27
00:01:19,508 --> 00:01:20,269
give you a concept, give you,

28
00:01:20,269 --> 00:01:21,610
I'll be using both in this talk.

29
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:23,291
So one of the dirty secrets of Congregate

30
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,532
is that we depend very heavily on 2% of our players.

31
00:01:39,893 --> 00:01:44,706
In 2000, we launched our virtual goods in-app purchasing

32
00:01:44,706 --> 00:01:45,609
on our platform.

33
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:47,700
about six years ago at the end of 2008.

34
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,362
And since that time period, 2.1% of accounts active

35
00:01:51,362 --> 00:01:52,883
have purchased virtual goods.

36
00:01:52,883 --> 00:01:54,284
And those 2% buying have brought in 75%

37
00:01:54,284 --> 00:01:56,945
of the revenue on Congregate.

38
00:01:56,945 --> 00:01:59,546
The other 25% comes from advertising.

39
00:01:59,546 --> 00:02:01,527
And that split has increased over the years.

40
00:02:01,527 --> 00:02:03,008
So in 2014, 85% of our revenue came from virtual goods.

41
00:02:15,272 --> 00:02:17,114
and just 15% from advertising.

42
00:02:18,963 --> 00:02:22,565
And if you look closer, it's actually much, much more

43
00:02:22,565 --> 00:02:24,767
concentrated than that.

44
00:02:24,767 --> 00:02:29,689
So this takes a look at our buyers since 2008

45
00:02:29,689 --> 00:02:31,210
on congregate.com.

46
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:35,392
And on the left-hand chart, it splits them out,

47
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:38,314
splits all the spenders out by the amount

48
00:02:38,314 --> 00:02:40,635
they spent lifetime on the Congregate platform.

49
00:02:40,635 --> 00:02:42,936
So you can see that about a little more than 50%

50
00:02:42,936 --> 00:02:43,536
have spent less than $10.

51
00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:50,250
And about 4% have spent $500 or more.

52
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:54,471
On the right-hand side, and did I get my left and right confused?

53
00:02:54,471 --> 00:02:56,972
Because that sometimes happens to me.

54
00:02:56,972 --> 00:02:57,612
No, it's right.

55
00:02:57,612 --> 00:03:01,554
On the right-hand side, you've got the same split

56
00:03:01,554 --> 00:03:03,795
looking at the percent of revenue coming

57
00:03:03,795 --> 00:03:05,475
from that category of buyers.

58
00:03:07,962 --> 00:03:13,024
54% who spent less than $10 represent exactly 1% of our total revenue in the last six years.

59
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:18,006
And the 4% of people who have spent $500 or more are 72% of our revenue.

60
00:03:18,006 --> 00:03:22,248
So if you multiply 4% by 2%, that's 0.1% of our player base is representing half of our

61
00:03:22,248 --> 00:03:22,528
revenue.

62
00:03:34,044 --> 00:03:36,931
If you look at individual games, it's the same story.

63
00:03:36,931 --> 00:03:41,041
So this is the top eight grossing games

64
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,083
on Kongregate during 2014.

65
00:03:43,108 --> 00:03:45,709
looking at their revenue distribution

66
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:46,890
by spender category.

67
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:49,371
So that same chart on the right that I looked at

68
00:03:49,371 --> 00:03:51,512
from the previous account.

69
00:03:51,512 --> 00:03:54,313
If you can't read it, the bright green,

70
00:03:54,313 --> 00:03:57,614
it represents the revenue from spenders

71
00:03:57,614 --> 00:03:58,754
who spent more than $500.

72
00:03:58,754 --> 00:04:02,836
And you can see that six out of eight games

73
00:04:02,836 --> 00:04:05,197
get the vast majority of their revenue

74
00:04:05,197 --> 00:04:07,098
from people who spent more than $500.

75
00:04:09,548 --> 00:04:14,490
and all eight get the clear majority of their revenue

76
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:15,291
from people who spent $100 or more.

77
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:18,892
On mobile, the pattern is similar.

78
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:22,454
Here are our top five grossing games on mobile broken out

79
00:04:22,454 --> 00:04:23,274
the same way.

80
00:04:23,274 --> 00:04:26,035
The spend is a little bit more distributed

81
00:04:26,035 --> 00:04:27,135
for a couple of reasons.

82
00:04:27,135 --> 00:04:30,077
One is that the games haven't been out as long.

83
00:04:30,077 --> 00:04:32,718
And the longer that you're out, the more

84
00:04:32,718 --> 00:04:34,598
that you're going to get concentration of spend.

85
00:04:34,878 --> 00:04:37,059
and people who are playing for a long time.

86
00:04:37,059 --> 00:04:38,940
But the other factor is genre.

87
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,881
On the web, our top grossing games

88
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:45,304
are pretty dominated by MMORPGs and collectible card games.

89
00:04:45,304 --> 00:04:47,485
And on mobile, we've deliberately

90
00:04:47,485 --> 00:04:49,967
diversified a little bit more beyond that.

91
00:04:51,604 --> 00:04:54,446
If you look at the same games, quite a few of these games

92
00:04:54,446 --> 00:04:57,628
we have on both web and mobile, and their distribution of spend

93
00:04:57,628 --> 00:05:00,531
on the website and on the mobile are so close

94
00:05:00,531 --> 00:05:02,652
that it's difficult to tell the charts apart.

95
00:05:02,652 --> 00:05:06,955
Fundamentally, how people are spending in your game

96
00:05:06,955 --> 00:05:10,118
is going to be the same whatever platform that you're on.

97
00:05:10,118 --> 00:05:13,160
And with the exception of one game,

98
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,702
the vast majority of our games are getting their revenue

99
00:05:16,702 --> 00:05:19,004
from people who are spending $100 plus or more.

100
00:05:20,322 --> 00:05:23,704
And it's not just Congregate, and it's not just our games.

101
00:05:23,704 --> 00:05:25,685
This is normal for the industry.

102
00:05:25,685 --> 00:05:29,608
So Swerve, which is an analytics and A-B testing platform,

103
00:05:29,608 --> 00:05:32,229
did a report back in January of 2014.

104
00:05:33,824 --> 00:05:39,750
where they looked at everybody playing and spending across all of their games using their services

105
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:44,614
and found that one and a half percent of people active that month spent,

106
00:05:44,614 --> 00:05:46,576
and then when they broke them into deciles,

107
00:05:46,576 --> 00:05:51,040
they found that the top ten percent of spenders represented half of the revenue.

108
00:05:52,762 --> 00:05:55,644
0.15% of active players were half the revenue,

109
00:05:55,644 --> 00:05:57,446
a little bit more diffuse than Congregate,

110
00:05:57,446 --> 00:05:58,627
but not meaningfully different.

111
00:05:58,627 --> 00:06:00,509
And this is with a lot of games that

112
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:02,370
didn't have where the highest thing that you could buy

113
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:02,630
was $19.99.

114
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,512
So while this is totally true of the industry,

115
00:06:04,512 --> 00:06:06,454
it's also something that we're really uncomfortable with.

116
00:06:06,454 --> 00:06:06,994
So let's see.

117
00:06:06,994 --> 00:06:07,034
OK.

118
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,641
There, now I'm on the right slide.

119
00:06:19,641 --> 00:06:23,103
So whenever I mention that our top spenders on Congregate

120
00:06:23,103 --> 00:06:26,125
have spent $50,000 to $80,000, people nearly always

121
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:31,429
react with kind of this mix of awe and horror.

122
00:06:31,429 --> 00:06:34,971
And there's a lot of criticism for free-to-play games

123
00:06:34,971 --> 00:06:35,351
and ethics.

124
00:06:35,351 --> 00:06:38,633
And one of the things that they quickly jump on

125
00:06:38,633 --> 00:06:41,215
is the amount that the biggest spenders are spending.

126
00:06:41,215 --> 00:06:42,416
And they start questioning.

127
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,543
Are these people sane?

128
00:06:46,543 --> 00:06:49,566
Are developers some kind of predator

129
00:06:49,566 --> 00:06:52,409
that's ripping money from these people?

130
00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:54,391
And it's not just ethical concerns.

131
00:06:54,391 --> 00:06:56,353
People worry that free-to-play games

132
00:06:56,353 --> 00:06:58,936
are too financially dependent on just a few people.

133
00:06:59,556 --> 00:07:04,962
So much so that Zynga listed it as a risk in their IPO perspectives.

134
00:07:04,962 --> 00:07:08,605
Now, from my perspective, pretty much every business is dependent on good customers,

135
00:07:08,605 --> 00:07:15,992
so I don't think it's much of a risk, but Zynga certainly thought so and publishized it.

136
00:07:17,694 --> 00:07:19,535
So to better understand what's going on here,

137
00:07:19,535 --> 00:07:23,438
I think it makes sense to take a look at who's buying.

138
00:07:23,438 --> 00:07:27,881
This chart shows average revenue per user, or ARPU,

139
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:32,223
on congregate.com by the reported age of the user

140
00:07:32,223 --> 00:07:37,226
at registration, or the birth date reported at registration

141
00:07:37,226 --> 00:07:38,227
and whatever age they are.

142
00:07:38,737 --> 00:07:45,120
now. So, young users spend very little on average, with spend rising gradually through

143
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:51,483
college age, rapidly increasing after they graduate, and then plateauing through middle

144
00:07:51,483 --> 00:07:56,485
age when disposable income is at its highest. There's some weird little sharp dips at 25

145
00:07:56,485 --> 00:08:01,987
and 35, and that's probably driven by people putting in fake January 1, 1980 and 1990.

146
00:08:04,465 --> 00:08:09,569
birth dates, because those are exactly 15, sorry, 25 and 35

147
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:10,609
years ago now.

148
00:08:10,609 --> 00:08:15,112
There's also an issue with people

149
00:08:15,112 --> 00:08:21,097
with the ages over than 57, because our registration form

150
00:08:21,097 --> 00:08:22,017
anchors at 1940.

151
00:08:22,017 --> 00:08:26,480
And everything from age 57 or older is immediately visible,

152
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,803
so probably has a high portion of people who are just

153
00:08:29,803 --> 00:08:30,643
putting in random ages.

154
00:08:31,702 --> 00:08:35,625
But just looking at the core data from 13 through 57,

155
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:39,928
you can still see a really clear trend

156
00:08:39,928 --> 00:08:42,130
and in terms of what's going on.

157
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,251
You can see a little bit more of what's going on

158
00:08:43,251 --> 00:08:49,416
if you decompose ARPU between percentage of buyers

159
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:54,279
and the average revenue per paying user or ARPU.

160
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,541
Is that my computer?

161
00:08:58,541 --> 00:08:58,601
OK.

162
00:08:58,601 --> 00:09:03,805
The youngest players generally don't have a way of paying,

163
00:09:03,805 --> 00:09:06,226
no credit cards or PayPal accounts.

164
00:09:06,226 --> 00:09:10,209
But the percent of players who are buying

165
00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:13,191
rises rapidly with age and independence,

166
00:09:13,191 --> 00:09:14,332
and then plateauing.

167
00:09:15,002 --> 00:09:17,523
through the 30s before just starting to decline in the 40s.

168
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:22,726
I suspect that people in their 40s now are kind of the first generation that grew up

169
00:09:22,726 --> 00:09:27,168
with video games, and so familiarity and comfort with video games is a little bit lower past

170
00:09:27,168 --> 00:09:27,348
that age.

171
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:32,032
The increase in ARPAPU, though, is much more gradual

172
00:09:32,032 --> 00:09:35,534
and peaks in the late 40s and early 50s.

173
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:40,377
Again, ignore most of the data from age 50.

174
00:09:40,377 --> 00:09:44,400
That's distorted by the registration process.

175
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,441
What is clear, though, is that spending

176
00:09:46,441 --> 00:09:49,863
grows first with the ability to pay and then the means to pay.

177
00:09:51,937 --> 00:09:56,479
This chart shows US disposable income

178
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:59,260
by educational attainment and age.

179
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:03,062
And if you look at sort of the angle of this chart

180
00:10:03,062 --> 00:10:06,263
and the growth of disposable income over age,

181
00:10:06,263 --> 00:10:11,305
it really mirrors the ARPA-PU growth very closely.

182
00:10:11,305 --> 00:10:13,406
People are spending what they can afford to spend.

183
00:10:13,406 --> 00:10:13,806
So this chart is,

184
00:10:19,955 --> 00:10:27,203
delving a little bit more granularly into our big spenders and takes our top 20 spenders lifetime on Congregate.com

185
00:10:27,203 --> 00:10:33,630
and sorts them from youngest to oldest. The youngest is 24. The oldest is 68.

186
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:37,835
Both the average and medium age of big spenders is 40.

187
00:10:39,651 --> 00:10:44,252
The older big spenders all come from the US and Western Europe,

188
00:10:44,252 --> 00:10:45,893
while the few younger spenders come

189
00:10:45,893 --> 00:10:47,073
from more assorted countries.

190
00:10:47,073 --> 00:10:51,634
The little red flag with a flower is Hong Kong.

191
00:10:51,634 --> 00:10:53,835
You can also see Brazil and the United Arab Emirates

192
00:10:53,835 --> 00:10:56,096
and Sweden are the people, are the spenders who are under 30.

193
00:10:56,096 --> 00:10:59,476
And our customer service team has spoken on the phone

194
00:10:59,476 --> 00:10:59,857
or emailed with.

195
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,241
every single person on this list,

196
00:11:09,241 --> 00:11:12,383
both to check that there was nothing fraudulent going on,

197
00:11:12,383 --> 00:11:14,724
and then to also help them with various

198
00:11:14,724 --> 00:11:16,445
in-game customer service issues

199
00:11:16,445 --> 00:11:20,027
and issues that arise when you spend that much money.

200
00:11:20,027 --> 00:11:24,670
And they say that every time they talk to them,

201
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:27,071
they're sort of impressed by sort of the politeness

202
00:11:27,071 --> 00:11:31,834
and reasonableness of all of these top 20 spenders.

203
00:11:33,233 --> 00:11:34,934
A lot of them own their own businesses.

204
00:11:34,934 --> 00:11:36,594
Some are engineers.

205
00:11:36,594 --> 00:11:41,898
There's a doctor with the CDC and CPAs and similar.

206
00:11:41,898 --> 00:11:45,480
These are sort of older, competent, professional people.

207
00:11:46,574 --> 00:11:49,215
The columns also show how much they spend

208
00:11:49,215 --> 00:11:53,756
and then breaks it out into what games they're spending it in.

209
00:11:53,756 --> 00:11:58,418
So that first blue part is their main game

210
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:00,118
that has the most spend.

211
00:12:00,118 --> 00:12:01,638
The red is their second game.

212
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:04,139
And then there's a few more colors for other games.

213
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:06,700
And one of the things that you can see really clearly here

214
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,781
is that most of these players are spending

215
00:12:10,661 --> 00:12:12,702
most of their money on one game.

216
00:12:12,702 --> 00:12:14,943
They may be buying in other games,

217
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:17,924
but they're really concentrating their resources in one game.

218
00:12:17,924 --> 00:12:22,225
The phenomenon of a serial big spender

219
00:12:22,225 --> 00:12:25,927
who's going in and dropping significant amounts of cash

220
00:12:25,927 --> 00:12:28,227
in game after game is really rare.

221
00:12:28,227 --> 00:12:31,809
I think there's only two, maybe three people out of this 20

222
00:12:31,809 --> 00:12:32,569
who show that pattern.

223
00:12:36,632 --> 00:12:41,855
So now I'm going to jump into a different look at the data and start looking at one

224
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,496
particular game.

225
00:12:42,496 --> 00:12:45,857
Because once you start looking at gameplay patterns, it makes much more sense to look

226
00:12:45,857 --> 00:12:46,818
at an individual game.

227
00:12:46,818 --> 00:12:52,181
The next series of slides are all going to be data from Tyrant Unleashed, which is a

228
00:12:52,181 --> 00:12:56,003
game we publish on mobile and web from Synapse Games.

229
00:12:56,003 --> 00:13:00,205
And thank you again Synapse for once more letting me share a lot of your data.

230
00:13:01,232 --> 00:13:04,894
So this chart, it takes a little while to look through,

231
00:13:04,894 --> 00:13:07,755
but it shows the average number of sessions

232
00:13:07,755 --> 00:13:12,498
per daily active user by the day they are in the game.

233
00:13:12,498 --> 00:13:16,259
So from one year, day of install in through.

234
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:23,933
a year and a half in, and then breaks it by the eventual spend category that they reach.

235
00:13:23,933 --> 00:13:29,015
So if they eventually become a $500 plus spender, then they're in the line in green.

236
00:13:29,015 --> 00:13:32,256
If they've spent less than $500, they're red.

237
00:13:32,256 --> 00:13:32,996
Non-spenders are blue.

238
00:13:33,717 --> 00:13:36,280
And what you can see is that from day one,

239
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:40,686
that the biggest spenders are much, much more active

240
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:42,548
than anybody else in the game.

241
00:13:42,548 --> 00:13:45,071
Over their lifetime, they're averaging around 20 sessions

242
00:13:45,071 --> 00:13:48,756
per day, whereas lesser spenders are averaging around 12,

243
00:13:48,756 --> 00:13:50,638
and non-spenders around five.

244
00:13:51,499 --> 00:13:54,001
The longer they're in the game, the more it comes together,

245
00:13:54,001 --> 00:14:00,085
but the pattern of big spenders are twice as active

246
00:14:00,085 --> 00:14:03,967
as lesser spenders and then twice as active again

247
00:14:03,967 --> 00:14:06,989
from non-spenders is pretty consistent.

248
00:14:09,621 --> 00:14:12,042
And most people who spend a long time in this game

249
00:14:12,042 --> 00:14:13,583
do end up spending.

250
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,785
So by about a year in,

251
00:14:15,785 --> 00:14:23,890
two thirds of all active players in the game have spent.

252
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:25,231
But non-spenders aren't driven out

253
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:29,154
because that still means a third of people

254
00:14:29,154 --> 00:14:32,116
have played the game for a year and a half without spending.

255
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:37,791
Most of them spend, some people spend pretty quickly.

256
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:40,573
About 18% of people make their first purchase

257
00:14:40,573 --> 00:14:42,814
on the day of install, and about half

258
00:14:42,814 --> 00:14:44,635
have made their first purchase within a week

259
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:45,115
of installing the game.

260
00:14:45,115 --> 00:14:46,396
But after that, it takes a long time to go up.

261
00:14:46,396 --> 00:14:47,196
And at a month in, 30% of the people

262
00:14:47,196 --> 00:14:48,317
who are going to purchase have not yet purchased.

263
00:14:48,317 --> 00:14:48,917
And even six months in.

264
00:14:59,312 --> 00:15:01,534
These graphs are not yet at 100%.

265
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:04,676
People are still making their first purchase,

266
00:15:04,676 --> 00:15:07,257
even people who are going to go on to spend $500 or more.

267
00:15:07,257 --> 00:15:11,860
As you would expect, the biggest spenders

268
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,581
do spend a little bit earlier and a little bit faster

269
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:16,543
than lesser spenders.

270
00:15:16,543 --> 00:15:17,903
But there's not really a big difference.

271
00:15:17,903 --> 00:15:19,444
People are, a lot of big spenders

272
00:15:19,444 --> 00:15:21,025
are taking their time before they

273
00:15:21,025 --> 00:15:22,026
make their first purchase.

274
00:15:24,562 --> 00:15:26,504
And they're spending gradually over time.

275
00:15:26,504 --> 00:15:31,307
So this breaks all of the spenders out into deciles

276
00:15:31,307 --> 00:15:34,550
by the average amount that they've spent,

277
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:41,035
and then looks at their spending by time in the game.

278
00:15:41,035 --> 00:15:44,838
And you can see, especially the first and second deciles,

279
00:15:44,838 --> 00:15:47,580
that their investment in the game is really, really gradual.

280
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,582
They're spending kind of the same amount every month

281
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:50,862
steadily.

282
00:15:52,297 --> 00:15:54,378
It's a little hard to see what some of the lower deciles

283
00:15:54,378 --> 00:15:58,599
are doing here, just because the top ones are so big.

284
00:15:58,599 --> 00:16:01,621
So here in this next slide, I'm taking away the top two.

285
00:16:01,621 --> 00:16:05,142
And you can see that that gradual investment is still

286
00:16:05,142 --> 00:16:10,344
happening just at a slightly less steep angle

287
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:11,884
and with a lower amount.

288
00:16:11,884 --> 00:16:15,506
The only groups that don't rise significantly over time

289
00:16:15,506 --> 00:16:18,026
are the bottom deciles, where people are spending $20 or less.

290
00:16:18,026 --> 00:16:21,188
And most of those are just making one purchase and done.

291
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:28,414
So how do you spend $5,000 in a game?

292
00:16:28,414 --> 00:16:35,238
Now I'm gonna look at one individual case of a big spender.

293
00:16:35,238 --> 00:16:37,940
This big spender is a 40-year-old Californian

294
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:40,061
whose primary game is an action RPG.

295
00:16:40,061 --> 00:16:43,623
It's single player in a social environment

296
00:16:43,623 --> 00:16:44,744
with a lot of skill-based leveling

297
00:16:44,744 --> 00:16:47,325
and multiple class paths that give him

298
00:16:47,325 --> 00:16:49,406
a strong feeling of progress.

299
00:16:49,406 --> 00:16:51,908
There's guilds and co-op multiplayer,

300
00:16:51,908 --> 00:16:53,869
PVP and tournaments that they participate in.

301
00:16:54,202 --> 00:16:57,124
And they play four to six days a week,

302
00:16:57,124 --> 00:16:59,765
play more than 1,000 times lifetime.

303
00:16:59,765 --> 00:17:02,526
And they play and spend in other games.

304
00:17:02,526 --> 00:17:06,488
But 90% of money and time is going into just this one game.

305
00:17:06,488 --> 00:17:08,929
So you can see that that fits the sort

306
00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:12,690
of prototypical stereotype of the big spenders

307
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,431
that we've talked about up to this point.

308
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:19,490
What do they actually spend on?

309
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:20,991
So in 2014, they spent about $7,500,

310
00:17:20,991 --> 00:17:23,792
$2,200 on consumables, $1,800 for skill upgrades,

311
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,173
some miscellaneous things, and then

312
00:17:25,173 --> 00:17:31,497
the bulk of their money going towards competitive multiplayer,

313
00:17:31,497 --> 00:17:36,781
tournament skilled wars, PVP, that kind of thing.

314
00:17:36,781 --> 00:17:38,922
So a little bit more about this big spender.

315
00:17:38,922 --> 00:17:39,042
It's me.

316
00:17:47,635 --> 00:17:50,357
And a little bit more about this big spender.

317
00:17:50,357 --> 00:17:52,539
I'm not spending it on a game.

318
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:53,800
I'm spending it on figure skating.

319
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,260
So how does that work?

320
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:59,985
Well, believe it or not, there's actually

321
00:17:59,985 --> 00:18:03,768
an amazing parallel between the structure

322
00:18:03,768 --> 00:18:06,710
of competitive figure skating and a game.

323
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:10,233
This has been the structure for the US Figure Skating

324
00:18:10,233 --> 00:18:13,216
Association since like 60 years, 70 years.

325
00:18:13,216 --> 00:18:15,658
But they may as well have invented gamification.

326
00:18:15,658 --> 00:18:15,818
So.

327
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:21,302
It's a single-player sport in a social environment.

328
00:18:21,302 --> 00:18:23,985
So, individual sport done in a shared session.

329
00:18:23,985 --> 00:18:29,189
So, I skate at the Yerba Buena rink that's kind of right on top of the conference center right now

330
00:18:29,189 --> 00:18:34,073
with other people who I get to know well and become friends with.

331
00:18:34,073 --> 00:18:37,976
If this makes me slightly cooler, one of them is occasionally Brian Boitano.

332
00:18:40,211 --> 00:18:41,192
who is a very nice guy.

333
00:18:41,192 --> 00:18:45,375
There's skill-based leveling, multiple class paths,

334
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:50,579
so there's five different classes in which you compete

335
00:18:50,579 --> 00:18:53,201
and can test up and level up.

336
00:18:53,201 --> 00:18:56,864
I'm progressing along the moves in the field,

337
00:18:56,864 --> 00:19:01,367
basic skills tests, as well as singles, freestyle.

338
00:19:01,367 --> 00:19:01,587
And I am...

339
00:19:04,718 --> 00:19:08,319
I've tested through three levels on moves in the field

340
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:11,220
and on two levels on freestyle and working

341
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,261
to level up on both.

342
00:19:13,261 --> 00:19:18,142
And I do this by learning new skills, achievements,

343
00:19:18,142 --> 00:19:19,122
and then testing in the test session.

344
00:19:19,122 --> 00:19:22,703
So, say, an example might be a sit-spin or a flip-jump

345
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,263
or something like that.

346
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:25,684
There's guilds and co-op multiplayer.

347
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:33,599
So I'm a member of the skating club of San Francisco.

348
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:36,761
I'm also a member of a synchronized skating team.

349
00:19:36,761 --> 00:19:38,102
And believe me, there's nothing cool about that.

350
00:19:38,102 --> 00:19:41,684
That's the picture of me in that red sequined vest

351
00:19:41,684 --> 00:19:43,306
with something really strange in my hair.

352
00:19:43,306 --> 00:19:45,687
That's my synchronized skating team.

353
00:19:45,687 --> 00:19:47,348
There's also ice dance in Paris, but I don't do that.

354
00:19:48,957 --> 00:19:51,098
And there's competitive multiplayer.

355
00:19:51,098 --> 00:19:54,179
So there's frequent competitions

356
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:57,359
organized by age, level, and mode.

357
00:19:57,359 --> 00:19:59,940
And points are also tallied for clubs and rinks.

358
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,720
And that pressure is actually very real

359
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,681
and very significant, and is the reason why

360
00:20:04,681 --> 00:20:07,301
in that picture there to the right,

361
00:20:07,301 --> 00:20:09,742
I'm dressed like a B-52.

362
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:11,742
We were hosting a competition at my rink,

363
00:20:11,742 --> 00:20:13,143
and the rink manager wanted.

364
00:20:13,483 --> 00:20:19,708
all of the good skaters to compete in as many events as possible so we would earn more points.

365
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:24,112
And she made me do this group routine in this particular outfit.

366
00:20:24,112 --> 00:20:27,635
And the good news is that we did win that trophy and she was happy.

367
00:20:31,229 --> 00:20:36,812
So, what, you know, I gave all these sort of game equivalents to my spending.

368
00:20:36,812 --> 00:20:43,775
So, the consumables was my ice time, so just going to my daily session costs about $11.

369
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:46,116
I do that almost every day. That adds up.

370
00:20:46,116 --> 00:20:50,638
The skilled upgrades are my private lessons.

371
00:20:50,638 --> 00:20:54,380
I take a $135 half hour lesson every week.

372
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,660
That ends up being about $1,800 a year.

373
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:01,624
There's some miscellaneous costs for equipment and costumes.

374
00:21:01,624 --> 00:21:06,088
But the big bulk of money is going to competition fees

375
00:21:06,088 --> 00:21:08,811
and travel to get to competitions.

376
00:21:08,811 --> 00:21:10,212
And even with $7,500, I definitely

377
00:21:10,212 --> 00:21:12,895
haven't hit my max spend.

378
00:21:12,895 --> 00:21:15,878
I'm actually participating in relatively few competitions,

379
00:21:15,878 --> 00:21:18,020
because I have to travel so much for Congregate already.

380
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:23,083
And while I'm naturally thrifty, I'm happy to spend this money.

381
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:26,546
I love skating enough that a 10% increase in my skills

382
00:21:26,546 --> 00:21:28,308
is worth 10x the cost.

383
00:21:28,308 --> 00:21:30,830
When I make this comparison, people

384
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:34,273
will often dismiss it as being fundamentally different

385
00:21:34,273 --> 00:21:35,514
because skating is exercise.

386
00:21:36,338 --> 00:21:39,521
I can resell my skates, et cetera.

387
00:21:39,521 --> 00:21:41,903
Skating is good for my health, but you can see here

388
00:21:41,903 --> 00:21:46,146
that most of my spend is going to skill progression

389
00:21:46,146 --> 00:21:49,029
and competition, and that's exactly the same things

390
00:21:49,029 --> 00:21:50,910
that you spend on in game.

391
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:53,792
Nothing, well, except for the actual ice time,

392
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:56,935
nothing that's listed here has any resale value

393
00:21:56,935 --> 00:22:00,017
or does any good for my health.

394
00:22:00,017 --> 00:22:01,719
Even the equipment is really services

395
00:22:01,719 --> 00:22:03,500
like skate sharpening and my locker.

396
00:22:05,515 --> 00:22:08,318
And my larger point here is that games are hobbies,

397
00:22:08,318 --> 00:22:10,159
and people spend a lot on their hobbies.

398
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,762
So an example would be a weekly golfer

399
00:22:13,762 --> 00:22:17,104
could easily spend $10,000 a year on greens fees,

400
00:22:17,104 --> 00:22:21,268
and golf clubs, lessons, going to the driving range.

401
00:22:22,256 --> 00:22:25,879
somebody's an amateur guitarist, while they might not spend much day to day,

402
00:22:25,879 --> 00:22:32,223
the few that I've known tend to obsess about collecting guitars and, you know,

403
00:22:32,223 --> 00:22:35,945
will go visit shops that have guitars that they like that they can't afford

404
00:22:35,945 --> 00:22:36,686
just to sort of touch and see them.

405
00:22:38,227 --> 00:22:42,211
and usually end up spending more than they really want to on guitars.

406
00:22:42,211 --> 00:22:45,514
Going to eat in restaurants adds up very quickly if you do it weekly,

407
00:22:45,514 --> 00:22:47,356
especially in San Francisco.

408
00:22:47,356 --> 00:22:52,100
And baseball fans, season tickets, a visit to spring training,

409
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,443
that can be 5,000 between them pretty quickly.

410
00:22:56,211 --> 00:23:00,093
Even something like your aunt does, like quilting.

411
00:23:00,093 --> 00:23:01,814
Materials get expensive pretty quickly,

412
00:23:01,814 --> 00:23:03,374
and it's nicer to use nice materials,

413
00:23:03,374 --> 00:23:06,556
so people will spend on that.

414
00:23:06,556 --> 00:23:08,617
A really good sewing machine is going to cost $5,000,

415
00:23:08,617 --> 00:23:12,179
and if you're doing it all the time, you're going to want that.

416
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:15,280
Even something that seems like it would be really cheap,

417
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,701
relatively like running.

418
00:23:18,442 --> 00:23:23,665
somebody who becomes a competitive runner is likely to start spending money.

419
00:23:23,665 --> 00:23:26,826
You're going to go through shoes pretty quickly,

420
00:23:26,826 --> 00:23:27,947
and at $100, $150 a pop,

421
00:23:27,947 --> 00:23:31,469
you can spend $500 on shoes and clothes quite easily.

422
00:23:31,469 --> 00:23:36,252
Especially once you start competing, race fees and travel to races,

423
00:23:36,252 --> 00:23:38,893
it adds up just the way my figure skating does.

424
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,171
So how did I get started on this path?

425
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:47,333
And I think looking at sort of the long term pattern

426
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:49,955
of my spin kind of explains a lot about

427
00:23:49,955 --> 00:23:52,796
sort of the psychology and how things work.

428
00:23:52,796 --> 00:23:56,298
So I started skating back in 2004.

429
00:23:57,695 --> 00:24:00,156
looking for an alternative exercise,

430
00:24:00,156 --> 00:24:03,357
immediately fell in love, started taking group lessons,

431
00:24:03,357 --> 00:24:06,918
and I bought skates.

432
00:24:06,918 --> 00:24:11,319
And in 2005 and early 2006, my spend was accelerating.

433
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:15,401
Then in June of 2006, my brother and I started Congregate,

434
00:24:15,401 --> 00:24:19,602
and suddenly I had neither money nor time.

435
00:24:19,602 --> 00:24:21,163
We were going without salaries.

436
00:24:21,163 --> 00:24:23,183
And so there's about a two-year period

437
00:24:23,183 --> 00:24:25,144
where I was barely skating and barely spending at all.

438
00:24:26,205 --> 00:24:26,786
things stabilized by 2009.

439
00:24:26,786 --> 00:24:28,888
And I went back to sort of the trend line

440
00:24:28,888 --> 00:24:30,009
that I'd been on before.

441
00:24:30,009 --> 00:24:30,990
In 2010, we sold Kongregate to GameStop.

442
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:35,374
And I used some of that money to buy custom skates.

443
00:24:35,374 --> 00:24:37,676
And then they're made by the same people who

444
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:38,517
make them for Brian Boitano.

445
00:24:38,517 --> 00:24:41,300
So again, they're very cool.

446
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,562
And I'm still using those from five years ago.

447
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:53,051
It was a good investment.

448
00:24:53,051 --> 00:24:55,912
And then I started competing and joined the SYNC team.

449
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:59,373
It jumped a lot last year when I went to compete at my first nationals.

450
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:01,394
It was in Massachusetts in April.

451
00:25:01,394 --> 00:25:08,856
I'm probably the only person who has ever combined a trip to PAX East and adult skating nationals.

452
00:25:08,856 --> 00:25:12,938
And this coming year, I expect that I'm going to spend even more.

453
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:19,087
guesstimating somewhere around $12,000.

454
00:25:19,087 --> 00:25:20,069
When I turned 40 last year,

455
00:25:20,069 --> 00:25:22,073
my family gave me a really, really lovely gift

456
00:25:22,073 --> 00:25:25,860
of a trip to the Dorothy Hamill Fantasy Skate Camp.

457
00:25:26,774 --> 00:25:37,101
It was awesome, and I'm likely to go back and spend a week with great coaches skating for a week again.

458
00:25:37,101 --> 00:25:47,328
And I could really easily see spending, say, $20,000 in a year if I did both adult nationals and the big international competition in Germany,

459
00:25:47,328 --> 00:25:49,570
work with a choreographer, do things like that.

460
00:25:50,391 --> 00:25:52,794
So I don't know that I would do that sort of regularly,

461
00:25:52,794 --> 00:25:55,597
but I can very much see that happening

462
00:25:55,597 --> 00:25:58,401
and feel that it would be rational.

463
00:25:58,401 --> 00:25:59,963
You know, the choices that I'm making here

464
00:25:59,963 --> 00:26:02,025
may seem a little unusual,

465
00:26:02,025 --> 00:26:04,749
but they've been gradual, thoughtful investments

466
00:26:04,749 --> 00:26:06,251
put to something that I love.

467
00:26:06,251 --> 00:26:07,793
I'd rather spend money on figure skating

468
00:26:07,793 --> 00:26:08,674
than almost anything else.

469
00:26:10,847 --> 00:26:15,694
So I'm lucky enough to have the means and disposable income

470
00:26:15,694 --> 00:26:18,979
to put towards skating, especially

471
00:26:18,979 --> 00:26:20,321
as I don't have kids.

472
00:26:20,321 --> 00:26:22,925
But that's not true of all skaters or all gamers.

473
00:26:24,064 --> 00:26:26,466
Here's a friend that I skate with on Facebook posting

474
00:26:26,466 --> 00:26:29,709
about her decision not to go to nationals this year

475
00:26:29,709 --> 00:26:31,390
because her husband has lost her job

476
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:34,372
and they need to budget and save.

477
00:26:34,372 --> 00:26:37,395
And she's saving, but she's putting the money goes

478
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:39,876
to the mortgage first and then health care.

479
00:26:39,876 --> 00:26:42,258
And then she's saving for her nephew's wedding.

480
00:26:42,258 --> 00:26:44,380
But she's still finding enough money in the budget

481
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:48,843
to skate and take lessons and do the base case.

482
00:26:48,843 --> 00:26:50,465
And then several other people are chiming in

483
00:26:50,465 --> 00:26:51,766
about their decision making.

484
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,745
again deciding it was too expensive to go to nationals.

485
00:26:57,773 --> 00:27:01,794
The point here is that even avid fans

486
00:27:01,794 --> 00:27:04,575
are making rational, thoughtful decisions

487
00:27:04,575 --> 00:27:06,876
about how they're spending.

488
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:09,196
Now, not every skater or gamer is

489
00:27:09,196 --> 00:27:12,397
making their spending decisions totally rationally

490
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:13,097
and within their budget.

491
00:27:13,097 --> 00:27:18,938
There's always a spectrum of human behavior in any group,

492
00:27:18,938 --> 00:27:20,459
and there's always going to be some people who

493
00:27:20,459 --> 00:27:25,320
are trying to fill unmet emotional needs

494
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,480
in unhealthy ways.

495
00:27:27,308 --> 00:27:30,231
But we don't blame department stores

496
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:35,757
for the occasional compulsive shopper.

497
00:27:35,757 --> 00:27:37,899
And we shouldn't blame either figure skating or games

498
00:27:37,899 --> 00:27:39,641
for the occasional compulsive spender.

499
00:27:39,641 --> 00:27:41,182
And it's not just figure skating,

500
00:27:41,182 --> 00:27:42,904
and it's not just games.

501
00:27:42,904 --> 00:27:45,306
Other industries have similar dynamics.

502
00:27:45,306 --> 00:27:46,628
For example, the music industry.

503
00:27:48,148 --> 00:27:51,189
So if you start with a base of radio, which

504
00:27:51,189 --> 00:27:56,911
is a really mass audience, and streaming, and piracy,

505
00:27:56,911 --> 00:27:59,911
most artists are getting very little money

506
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:03,152
from these sources.

507
00:28:03,152 --> 00:28:07,513
But they're getting a lot of exposure to a broad audience

508
00:28:07,513 --> 00:28:09,694
in the hope that a smaller percentage of them

509
00:28:09,694 --> 00:28:12,815
are going to go on and buy either a physical or digital

510
00:28:12,815 --> 00:28:15,335
copy of their music.

511
00:28:16,458 --> 00:28:20,422
And then from there, a smaller percentage than that

512
00:28:20,422 --> 00:28:24,565
is going to go on and buy a ticket to go to a concert

513
00:28:24,565 --> 00:28:25,946
and maybe buy a t-shirt.

514
00:28:25,946 --> 00:28:30,530
And then there's going to be, in the last few years,

515
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:34,494
as the amount of revenue from the amount of people

516
00:28:34,494 --> 00:28:37,176
buying physical and digital copies of music

517
00:28:37,176 --> 00:28:39,898
has gone down with piracy and streaming,

518
00:28:39,898 --> 00:28:42,520
artists are getting more clever about putting together

519
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,562
packages, VIP packages.

520
00:28:46,384 --> 00:28:48,425
to sell sort of expensive experiences

521
00:28:48,425 --> 00:28:51,268
to their very highest fans.

522
00:28:51,268 --> 00:28:54,591
So what you see there is that overall,

523
00:28:54,591 --> 00:28:57,293
millions of people may be seeing,

524
00:28:57,293 --> 00:28:59,415
listening to an artist's music,

525
00:28:59,415 --> 00:29:02,238
but the artist's revenue is heavily concentrated

526
00:29:02,238 --> 00:29:04,079
in the 12% who spend 20 to $500

527
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:05,500
to go to concerts and buy merchandise.

528
00:29:07,642 --> 00:29:12,325
And even within that, it's probably concentrate on the repeat concert goers who are maybe

529
00:29:12,325 --> 00:29:17,028
traveling to get there, the people who buy every album, even the bad ones.

530
00:29:17,028 --> 00:29:19,870
And then, again, the people who are buying VIP packages.

531
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:23,613
I'm showing a screenshot here from one that U2 is doing.

532
00:29:23,733 --> 00:29:25,754
That's $1,500 for a ticket to the concert, a hotel room,

533
00:29:25,754 --> 00:29:28,575
and premium access to merchandise,

534
00:29:28,575 --> 00:29:34,138
where you can spend again, and just the possibility of a drawing

535
00:29:34,138 --> 00:29:36,240
where you might get to meet the band.

536
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:41,782
So, like a really low percentage chance that you might be anywhere near the band.

537
00:29:41,782 --> 00:29:42,263
And that's $1,500.

538
00:29:42,263 --> 00:29:44,844
And again, it's a little closer to home as well, in terms of the concentration.

539
00:29:50,894 --> 00:29:54,998
If you look at console games, the dynamics are more similar than you would expect.

540
00:29:54,998 --> 00:30:02,126
So GameStop, our parent company, is a very hefty percentage of the US market for video

541
00:30:02,126 --> 00:30:03,267
games.

542
00:30:03,267 --> 00:30:09,713
And they've reported publicly that 20% of their customers are members of PowerUp Rewards,

543
00:30:09,713 --> 00:30:11,035
which is their loyalty database.

544
00:30:11,569 --> 00:30:15,872
And 70% of their revenue is coming

545
00:30:15,872 --> 00:30:20,415
from those 20% of customers who are loyalty members.

546
00:30:20,415 --> 00:30:23,156
And even within that, it's more densely packed.

547
00:30:23,156 --> 00:30:26,598
So there's two tiers of Power Up Rewards membership.

548
00:30:26,598 --> 00:30:28,760
There's the free one, where you just

549
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,881
kind of give over your information,

550
00:30:29,881 --> 00:30:31,482
and you get an immediate discount.

551
00:30:31,482 --> 00:30:35,084
And you're earning points that you can potentially

552
00:30:35,084 --> 00:30:37,745
redeem for things in their loyalty store.

553
00:30:39,281 --> 00:30:41,102
And then there's the pro version, which costs $15

554
00:30:41,102 --> 00:30:44,785
and gets you a copy of Game Informer Magazine,

555
00:30:44,785 --> 00:30:47,687
larger discounts, and double the points.

556
00:30:47,687 --> 00:30:49,928
As you would imagine, anybody who's going to spend $15

557
00:30:49,928 --> 00:30:53,430
on a membership is a really good customer.

558
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:58,253
And so the people in the basic free tier, on average,

559
00:30:58,253 --> 00:31:00,035
buy from GameStop three times a year, spend $160.

560
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:06,954
The people in the pro buy 10 times on average and spend $570.

561
00:31:06,954 --> 00:31:07,875
And that's just their spend within GameStop.

562
00:31:07,875 --> 00:31:11,518
They're probably spending on Steam and other places.

563
00:31:11,518 --> 00:31:12,399
Now the number, the breakout between

564
00:31:21,043 --> 00:31:26,826
Basic and pro on power up members is not a public number, but you can make a guess that it's got to be

565
00:31:26,826 --> 00:31:32,849
you know less than 10% of the GameStop audience and somewhere in the 40 to 50 percent range of

566
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:33,309
total revenue

567
00:31:36,197 --> 00:31:39,918
So if this kind of distribution and this kind of setup

568
00:31:39,918 --> 00:31:44,100
is totally normal, why are we so uncomfortable with big spenders

569
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,760
in free-to-play games?

570
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,841
So uncomfortable that we quickly jump to mental illness

571
00:31:48,841 --> 00:31:52,062
and bad behavior on the game developer's part to explain it.

572
00:31:52,062 --> 00:31:52,943
So I think there's several reasons.

573
00:31:52,943 --> 00:31:53,283
One is data.

574
00:31:53,283 --> 00:31:55,023
Before free-to-play, we really didn't

575
00:31:55,023 --> 00:31:55,804
know how much people were spending.

576
00:32:03,862 --> 00:32:06,705
It was scattered across multiple sources,

577
00:32:06,705 --> 00:32:09,047
and those sources were generally retailers

578
00:32:09,047 --> 00:32:11,129
and platform holders.

579
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:15,212
Until recently, I doubt that the retailers themselves knew.

580
00:32:15,212 --> 00:32:18,094
I worked in data analysis and marketing

581
00:32:18,094 --> 00:32:21,037
for several retail companies before we started Congregate.

582
00:32:21,993 --> 00:32:25,935
And at that time, we knew almost everything

583
00:32:25,935 --> 00:32:28,916
about customers who were buying through catalogs and web.

584
00:32:28,916 --> 00:32:32,117
But if we wanted any data from the store,

585
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:34,578
it was always just anonymous transaction data.

586
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:36,719
And there was no way to figure out who

587
00:32:36,719 --> 00:32:38,940
was purchasing again and again.

588
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,201
An individual store manager might

589
00:32:40,201 --> 00:32:42,342
know who their big customers were

590
00:32:42,342 --> 00:32:45,363
and what they were spending on average.

591
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:48,024
But it took loyalty programs, which really took off

592
00:32:48,024 --> 00:32:48,905
in the last 10 years or so.

593
00:32:49,726 --> 00:32:51,907
for people at the retail level to really understand

594
00:32:51,907 --> 00:32:54,449
and collect this kind of data.

595
00:32:54,449 --> 00:32:56,411
And even once they had it,

596
00:32:56,411 --> 00:32:59,553
they were probably reasonably comfortable with it,

597
00:32:59,553 --> 00:33:02,756
because this kind of concentration is normal

598
00:33:02,756 --> 00:33:04,057
regardless of what you sell.

599
00:33:04,057 --> 00:33:08,040
I have a funny story about Larry Ellison

600
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,001
from a previous company

601
00:33:09,001 --> 00:33:10,482
that I probably shouldn't tell publicly,

602
00:33:10,482 --> 00:33:14,946
but if you ever catch me nodding at a podium,

603
00:33:14,946 --> 00:33:15,706
I will tell you what it is.

604
00:33:18,004 --> 00:33:23,452
So reason two is that spend is more concentrated,

605
00:33:23,452 --> 00:33:25,095
and we should be honest about that.

606
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,442
It's more concentrated, and the biggest spenders

607
00:33:30,442 --> 00:33:31,323
are spending more.

608
00:33:31,323 --> 00:33:34,405
So this table shows off the dynamics

609
00:33:34,405 --> 00:33:38,269
of mobile and web markets, starting with a base case

610
00:33:38,269 --> 00:33:39,770
of a paid mobile app.

611
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:43,533
These numbers are all made up, so don't read too closely

612
00:33:43,533 --> 00:33:43,793
into them.

613
00:33:43,793 --> 00:33:46,175
But I have enough data that I feel

614
00:33:46,175 --> 00:33:48,156
like these are pretty plausible as sort of above median cases,

615
00:33:48,156 --> 00:33:50,538
but way below actual real successes.

616
00:33:58,313 --> 00:34:02,094
In the current mobile market, it's really hard to get much of anyone to buy a game.

617
00:34:02,094 --> 00:34:04,395
There's just too much free content.

618
00:34:04,395 --> 00:34:08,557
When you go free, installs can explode, but conversion goes down

619
00:34:08,557 --> 00:34:11,298
and lives in a relatively narrow range.

620
00:34:11,298 --> 00:34:16,200
So what ends up mattering is whether players keep playing

621
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,662
and keep spending and drive the average amount spent up.

622
00:34:19,662 --> 00:34:22,423
And that's why free-to-play is generating more revenue than paid.

623
00:34:22,943 --> 00:34:25,587
It's not because more people are getting into your game

624
00:34:25,587 --> 00:34:27,790
and having a chance to convert.

625
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:30,034
Generally, you're going to have fewer buyers

626
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:32,878
than you would have otherwise.

627
00:34:32,878 --> 00:34:35,722
But I think people think that that's what the dynamic is,

628
00:34:35,722 --> 00:34:38,205
that you're getting more people in who might buy.

629
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:43,149
The total number of people buying is almost certainly going down

630
00:34:43,149 --> 00:34:47,930
because the more casually interested are not going to pay unless they have to.

631
00:34:47,930 --> 00:34:54,052
The reason that total revenue is up is because the most invested players

632
00:34:54,052 --> 00:34:58,593
who in a paid world spent the same as everyone else

633
00:34:58,593 --> 00:35:00,753
now have their spend uncapped.

634
00:35:00,753 --> 00:35:04,194
So some people who would have spent before enjoy the game for free

635
00:35:04,194 --> 00:35:07,415
and the most invested spend much more than they would have.

636
00:35:07,715 --> 00:35:10,224
essentially subsidizing a free experience for everybody else.

637
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:18,121
Reason three is that we don't value digital games very highly.

638
00:35:18,121 --> 00:35:22,602
So I've put together a chart, again, with some good numbers

639
00:35:22,602 --> 00:35:26,524
from MPD and some really, really shitty numbers

640
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:30,305
for paid PC games that are

641
00:35:30,305 --> 00:35:35,226
somewhat made up but somewhat plausible after talking to

642
00:35:35,226 --> 00:35:37,947
PC developers. So take it with a grain of salt.

643
00:35:37,947 --> 00:35:41,388
But the range of prices

644
00:35:41,388 --> 00:35:42,588
and sort of the...

645
00:35:43,236 --> 00:35:45,158
the general dynamics of total market size

646
00:35:45,158 --> 00:35:46,919
are probably pretty accurate.

647
00:35:46,919 --> 00:35:50,984
So console games have better graphics and more content

648
00:35:50,984 --> 00:35:54,808
to play through than most PC games or definitely

649
00:35:54,808 --> 00:35:56,049
most mobile games.

650
00:35:56,049 --> 00:35:59,793
But the average player only plays a small portion

651
00:35:59,793 --> 00:36:00,374
of that content.

652
00:36:00,374 --> 00:36:03,117
Completion rates on even the best games on console

653
00:36:03,117 --> 00:36:04,438
tend to be lower.

654
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,041
to be around 30%, I believe.

655
00:36:07,041 --> 00:36:11,605
Well, some mobile and PC games are quite short.

656
00:36:11,605 --> 00:36:14,268
Monument Valley is pretty darn short, for example.

657
00:36:14,268 --> 00:36:17,190
The delta between play times is likely a lot less

658
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:19,052
than the delta in price.

659
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:23,836
Is a new console game really worth four to five times

660
00:36:23,836 --> 00:36:25,098
the average PC game, 20 to 25 times

661
00:36:25,098 --> 00:36:27,840
the average paid mobile game?

662
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,082
I'm biased because I'm in that space,

663
00:36:30,082 --> 00:36:31,143
but I don't really think so.

664
00:36:32,165 --> 00:36:35,308
And the other thing is, again, these numbers are rough,

665
00:36:35,308 --> 00:36:38,631
but the market size of each of these genres,

666
00:36:38,631 --> 00:36:41,233
or not genres, platforms,

667
00:36:41,233 --> 00:36:42,514
marches roughly in step

668
00:36:42,514 --> 00:36:44,396
with the average sales price of a game.

669
00:36:44,396 --> 00:36:48,240
Though in theory, mobile and PC should be larger

670
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,643
than console games because they're platforms

671
00:36:51,643 --> 00:36:53,024
that have much broader reach.

672
00:36:53,024 --> 00:36:54,626
Almost everybody has a computer,

673
00:36:54,626 --> 00:36:55,947
almost everybody has a smartphone.

674
00:36:57,545 --> 00:37:02,006
So why is price mattering more than the number of possible players?

675
00:37:02,006 --> 00:37:08,168
And that's because I believe demand for games is fundamentally inelastic.

676
00:37:08,168 --> 00:37:13,209
So what inelastic means is that when the price drops,

677
00:37:13,209 --> 00:37:18,490
the total amount sold increases, but not enough to account,

678
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:22,051
to make up for the drop in price, so total revenue is lower.

679
00:37:23,397 --> 00:37:26,100
And I know you're thinking, OK, that

680
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,261
doesn't make any sense at all.

681
00:37:27,261 --> 00:37:30,444
If that's true, why do PC game developers

682
00:37:30,444 --> 00:37:33,147
make so much more when they're part of Steam sales

683
00:37:33,147 --> 00:37:34,528
and Humble Bundle?

684
00:37:34,528 --> 00:37:37,090
Clearly, price is dropping and their revenue is going up.

685
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:41,535
But when you think about it, that's what's going on

686
00:37:41,535 --> 00:37:44,558
is a sale and a special event.

687
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:48,336
And they're getting a lot more promotion.

688
00:37:48,336 --> 00:37:52,859
If you drop the price without giving them

689
00:37:52,859 --> 00:37:56,942
a lot more attention and putting a perception in the mind

690
00:37:56,942 --> 00:37:59,264
of the player that they're getting this amazing limited

691
00:37:59,264 --> 00:38:03,366
time deal, the revenue for these games

692
00:38:03,366 --> 00:38:04,727
wouldn't go up at that same price.

693
00:38:04,727 --> 00:38:05,408
They would go down.

694
00:38:07,663 --> 00:38:11,285
Steam sales help draw more people into play PC games,

695
00:38:11,285 --> 00:38:14,606
which increases the sale for that category overall,

696
00:38:14,606 --> 00:38:17,688
and exposes consumers to a lot broader range

697
00:38:17,688 --> 00:38:19,328
of games and developers,

698
00:38:19,328 --> 00:38:21,509
which overall is really good for the industry.

699
00:38:21,509 --> 00:38:23,830
But it's probably mostly cannibalizing revenue

700
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:25,191
that would otherwise have gone to console.

701
00:38:27,725 --> 00:38:32,489
So pricing studies have consistently shown that we make our decisions based on our perceived

702
00:38:32,489 --> 00:38:35,492
sense of value rather than price alone.

703
00:38:35,492 --> 00:38:40,256
And interestingly, price itself is a signal of value to most of us.

704
00:38:40,256 --> 00:38:46,021
So we assume that if the price being charged is higher, the item must be better.

705
00:38:46,021 --> 00:38:46,081
So

706
00:38:47,222 --> 00:38:51,123
If you see a higher priced wine, your default assumption is that it's better wine.

707
00:38:51,123 --> 00:38:55,405
You don't have really any way to know that, but the price is giving you that signal.

708
00:38:55,405 --> 00:39:03,508
If you go into a drugstore and you see a brand name like Aleve right next to the Walgreens Naproxen sodium,

709
00:39:04,385 --> 00:39:07,447
Those are exactly the same things, and yet people,

710
00:39:07,447 --> 00:39:10,750
and this includes me, have a tendency to go reach over

711
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:13,653
and buy the Aleve because it must be better

712
00:39:13,653 --> 00:39:15,114
because it's more expensive.

713
00:39:15,114 --> 00:39:17,517
But it's really the same thing.

714
00:39:17,517 --> 00:39:19,718
So on mobile, we have anchored our perception

715
00:39:19,718 --> 00:39:21,540
of value really low.

716
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,201
How much for them J's? $1,000.

717
00:39:22,201 --> 00:39:22,361
Sold.

718
00:39:22,361 --> 00:39:23,502
Yo, you gotta get some app.

719
00:39:23,502 --> 00:39:23,762
It's free.

720
00:39:23,762 --> 00:39:23,842
What?

721
00:39:23,842 --> 00:39:23,922
No, no!

722
00:39:35,154 --> 00:39:38,875
So we're all familiar with the terrible race to the bottom

723
00:39:38,875 --> 00:39:41,715
on paid game pricing that happened on iOS a few years back.

724
00:39:41,715 --> 00:39:44,816
There was no retail or platform who cared about

725
00:39:44,816 --> 00:39:48,497
the total sales to organize and control price wars,

726
00:39:48,497 --> 00:39:50,678
and the going price for games was quickly pushed down

727
00:39:50,678 --> 00:39:51,118
to 99 cents.

728
00:39:52,433 --> 00:39:58,058
Games that you can play for many hours are priced at or below a cup of coffee, or the

729
00:39:58,058 --> 00:40:01,242
cost of renting a movie that lasts 90 minutes.

730
00:40:01,242 --> 00:40:05,846
A few games can come in at higher prices, like Minecraft or Final Fantasy Tactics, when

731
00:40:05,846 --> 00:40:09,430
their value has been anchored high on another platform.

732
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:12,593
And prices are slowly creeping up again.

733
00:40:12,593 --> 00:40:13,534
$3.99 is more common.

734
00:40:13,534 --> 00:40:14,235
$4.99 is more common.

735
00:40:15,067 --> 00:40:18,311
But for paid games to be viable for more developers,

736
00:40:18,311 --> 00:40:21,295
prices need to rise a lot, among other things,

737
00:40:21,295 --> 00:40:24,539
so that sale events can be more meaningful.

738
00:40:24,539 --> 00:40:26,181
A $0.99 drop may be 50% on $1.99 game,

739
00:40:26,181 --> 00:40:30,287
but it's not going to get a lot of people excited.

740
00:40:32,853 --> 00:40:36,394
So that's why free-to-play is so strong in the mobile market.

741
00:40:36,394 --> 00:40:38,715
Free-to-play games set their own value.

742
00:40:38,715 --> 00:40:40,335
In a free-to-play game, nobody can

743
00:40:40,335 --> 00:40:43,056
sell a good that's useful except you, which makes

744
00:40:43,056 --> 00:40:44,216
your game a little monopoly.

745
00:40:44,216 --> 00:40:46,957
It's an insecure monopoly, though, because the player

746
00:40:46,957 --> 00:40:48,337
can leave at any time.

747
00:40:48,337 --> 00:40:51,438
And if you piss them off by pricing things

748
00:40:51,438 --> 00:40:54,099
in weird and aggressive ways, they are likely to leave.

749
00:40:55,063 --> 00:40:59,587
There's no point price shopping packages of gold between games

750
00:40:59,587 --> 00:41:03,430
or the value of any kind of premium currency.

751
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:05,631
The other game's items have no meaning in the game

752
00:41:05,631 --> 00:41:06,352
that you're playing.

753
00:41:06,352 --> 00:41:09,154
The more compelling and engaging the game,

754
00:41:09,154 --> 00:41:12,596
the more that players care about their status and progress,

755
00:41:12,596 --> 00:41:15,959
and the higher the value of the goods in the game

756
00:41:15,959 --> 00:41:18,921
become to the player, and the higher you can set your prices.

757
00:41:20,893 --> 00:41:24,536
Which comes to the next reason that I think

758
00:41:24,536 --> 00:41:27,118
is affecting our perception of big spenders, which is that we

759
00:41:27,118 --> 00:41:28,780
don't value virtual goods.

760
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:35,066
Our brains easily pin value on physical objects.

761
00:41:35,066 --> 00:41:37,108
Part of the reason console games have been able to continue

762
00:41:37,108 --> 00:41:40,551
to anchor their value high relative to digital versions

763
00:41:40,551 --> 00:41:41,692
is that disk.

764
00:41:41,692 --> 00:41:44,034
But that disk has been a tiny percentage

765
00:41:44,034 --> 00:41:46,956
of the cost of selling a console game for a very long time.

766
00:41:47,504 --> 00:41:50,071
It's the development, it's the retail share,

767
00:41:50,071 --> 00:41:50,753
it's the marketing.

768
00:41:50,753 --> 00:41:54,483
That's what's driving the cost up on just about everything.

769
00:41:56,297 --> 00:41:59,219
But even out of context, physical goods

770
00:41:59,219 --> 00:42:02,182
are always perceived as having value.

771
00:42:02,182 --> 00:42:04,343
But out of context of playing a game,

772
00:42:04,343 --> 00:42:06,145
virtual items have no meaning.

773
00:42:06,145 --> 00:42:08,187
They're incredibly abstract.

774
00:42:08,187 --> 00:42:10,389
And therefore, it's almost impossible for us

775
00:42:10,389 --> 00:42:12,891
to value something that we've never interacted with

776
00:42:12,891 --> 00:42:13,411
and never imagined.

777
00:42:13,411 --> 00:42:16,754
A physical good, we always assume

778
00:42:16,754 --> 00:42:20,137
it has a value because it had a cost to produce.

779
00:42:22,189 --> 00:42:25,892
So I think this is a large part of the success of Skylanders,

780
00:42:25,892 --> 00:42:29,476
for example, is that it bridges that gap between physical

781
00:42:29,476 --> 00:42:30,897
and virtual value.

782
00:42:30,897 --> 00:42:33,699
So a parent can go into a store and buy something

783
00:42:33,699 --> 00:42:36,902
that looks like something that they understand

784
00:42:36,902 --> 00:42:39,444
and give it to their child, who then converts it

785
00:42:39,444 --> 00:42:42,647
into a virtual item that has a lot more meaning to them.

786
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:49,391
So another example is that spending $5,000 to $10,000

787
00:42:49,391 --> 00:42:54,174
on a specialized PC gaming rig that improves your skill

788
00:42:54,174 --> 00:42:57,896
and your competitiveness in a highly competitive game

789
00:42:57,896 --> 00:43:01,657
like League of Legends can easily cost $5,000 to $10,000.

790
00:43:01,657 --> 00:43:04,439
And it's fundamentally the same as spending $5,000 to $10,000

791
00:43:04,439 --> 00:43:04,479
on.

792
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:10,600
skills and other things in a virtual game

793
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,961
that would improve your competitiveness.

794
00:43:12,961 --> 00:43:14,721
But I bet you all find it a lot easier

795
00:43:14,721 --> 00:43:16,962
to contemplate and accept.

796
00:43:16,962 --> 00:43:19,062
If you walked into this room,

797
00:43:19,062 --> 00:43:20,842
you're much more likely to say, wow,

798
00:43:20,842 --> 00:43:23,583
than what were you thinking.

799
00:43:23,583 --> 00:43:29,604
But if the same person had spent that same money in game,

800
00:43:29,604 --> 00:43:31,084
you would be a little bit more concerned.

801
00:43:33,382 --> 00:43:35,663
For the person who's spending in game,

802
00:43:35,663 --> 00:43:40,445
these items have context and they have equal value.

803
00:43:40,445 --> 00:43:43,426
And just because you haven't experienced it

804
00:43:43,426 --> 00:43:44,107
doesn't make it less valid.

805
00:43:44,107 --> 00:43:48,989
So reason five is that I don't think we value games

806
00:43:48,989 --> 00:43:50,670
equally with other hobbies.

807
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:55,332
Here's a lovely anti-game and slightly misogynistic quote

808
00:43:55,332 --> 00:43:57,553
from Ray Bradbury along that topic.

809
00:43:57,553 --> 00:44:01,254
And we don't value it not only with other hobbies

810
00:44:01,254 --> 00:44:02,995
or even other forms of entertainment.

811
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:06,503
A few weeks ago, I was looking for a comprehensive history

812
00:44:06,503 --> 00:44:08,865
of games going back to ancient times.

813
00:44:08,865 --> 00:44:11,247
And I was surprised to find that one does not

814
00:44:11,247 --> 00:44:12,708
appear to have been written.

815
00:44:12,708 --> 00:44:15,030
Most universities have entire departments

816
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:17,972
devoted to studying literature, film, and theater

817
00:44:17,972 --> 00:44:19,934
with virtually nothing about games.

818
00:44:19,934 --> 00:44:24,057
But we've been playing games back to thousands of years BC

819
00:44:24,057 --> 00:44:28,700
and playing and spending just as much time on them.

820
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:32,363
And yet, we don't give them any credence

821
00:44:32,363 --> 00:44:33,304
in an intellectual way.

822
00:44:34,456 --> 00:44:39,019
Games are a waste of time, games are for kids, games aren't art.

823
00:44:39,019 --> 00:44:43,243
All of those things are sort of this sort of backbeat of culture.

824
00:44:44,412 --> 00:44:48,654
It's not hard for me to talk about my obsession with figure skating with non-skaters.

825
00:44:48,654 --> 00:44:53,495
People generally think that it's kind of quirky and charming, that I care about something

826
00:44:53,495 --> 00:44:56,396
that is a little strange.

827
00:44:56,396 --> 00:45:00,998
Caring about sports, even unusual sports where you're wearing sequins and makeup and play

828
00:45:00,998 --> 00:45:03,679
music is broadly accepted.

829
00:45:03,679 --> 00:45:07,840
But if it were a game that I was spending that much money on, I think I'd be more defensive,

830
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:08,941
especially with non-gamers.

831
00:45:11,611 --> 00:45:16,434
The bias against games is so insidious that even within the industry, we've internalized

832
00:45:16,434 --> 00:45:20,476
enough that we question someone with means spending tens of thousands of dollars on a

833
00:45:20,476 --> 00:45:25,480
game, especially when you combine it with the low value we place on mobile and PC games

834
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,561
and especially virtual goods.

835
00:45:27,561 --> 00:45:32,104
And so people jump to explanations like mental illness or evil games manipulating players.

836
00:45:33,024 --> 00:45:37,389
when the real explanation is that they are rational, wealthy people

837
00:45:37,389 --> 00:45:41,634
who are dedicated fans of a particular game and investing in their progress in it.

838
00:45:43,669 --> 00:45:44,830
So please don't call them whales.

839
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:47,172
Call them hobbyists, call them super fans,

840
00:45:47,172 --> 00:45:48,073
call them something else.

841
00:45:48,073 --> 00:45:52,977
To call them whales is to dehumanize them.

842
00:45:52,977 --> 00:45:55,539
To talk of catching them suggests

843
00:45:55,539 --> 00:45:57,600
that they're blundering into your net

844
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:00,443
or somebody else's net, rather than choosing

845
00:46:00,443 --> 00:46:03,305
to spend their time and money in a game.

846
00:46:03,305 --> 00:46:06,608
And if we as developers don't respect our players

847
00:46:06,608 --> 00:46:08,750
and the value that we create, who will?

848
00:46:12,703 --> 00:46:13,144
Thank you.

849
00:46:13,144 --> 00:46:13,984
Thanks.

850
00:46:13,984 --> 00:46:26,234
A lot of people helped me with this talk, so thank you to them.

851
00:46:26,234 --> 00:46:31,558
I will post this talk and I've posted most of the other ones that I've done and other

852
00:46:31,558 --> 00:46:33,740
ones from congregate people on our blog.

853
00:46:34,601 --> 00:46:38,925
We have a booth in the expo this time so if you would like to talk to us, please stop

854
00:46:38,925 --> 00:46:39,746
by there.

855
00:46:39,746 --> 00:46:42,649
I'm happy to talk to people afterwards.

856
00:46:42,649 --> 00:46:47,553
You can follow me on Twitter, and I'm happy to take some questions now.

857
00:46:56,124 --> 00:47:00,066
The cost of the individual items for the hobbies is clear.

858
00:47:00,066 --> 00:47:04,727
So if you go to the sporting goods store, you know exactly what the cost is of your skates.

859
00:47:04,727 --> 00:47:08,249
You go to GameStop, you know exactly what the cost of Call of Duty is.

860
00:47:08,249 --> 00:47:15,091
Do you feel that it changes the model when there's an obfuscation of cost

861
00:47:15,091 --> 00:47:18,112
where you're using hard currency or gotcha,

862
00:47:18,112 --> 00:47:23,194
where it becomes much, much harder to know what the actual value is of the things that you're purchasing?

863
00:47:25,101 --> 00:47:29,227
I don't think it changes it that much.

864
00:47:29,227 --> 00:47:32,051
For one thing, most of these spenders are

865
00:47:32,051 --> 00:47:35,756
sort of very rational, careful optimizers.

866
00:47:35,756 --> 00:47:37,719
Ubisoft did a good talk last year

867
00:47:37,719 --> 00:47:40,923
where they did a lot of sort of social science research into.

868
00:47:42,064 --> 00:47:44,605
their biggest spenders in one particular game

869
00:47:44,605 --> 00:47:48,566
and found out that they were very careful,

870
00:47:48,566 --> 00:47:50,827
thoughtful people who were maximizing certain things.

871
00:47:50,827 --> 00:47:55,268
It makes the, with gotcha boxes,

872
00:47:55,268 --> 00:48:01,050
the individual result of a particular poll may be uncertain,

873
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:03,951
but the sort of total value of what you

874
00:48:03,951 --> 00:48:09,533
are likely to get at the end of it is pretty clear.

875
00:48:09,873 --> 00:48:13,475
and people who are spending that much are thinking it through.

876
00:48:13,475 --> 00:48:19,917
And, you know, I would say that, you know, when I got into figure skating,

877
00:48:19,917 --> 00:48:22,439
I had no idea how much I would spend.

878
00:48:22,439 --> 00:48:24,519
And even the first time going into nationals,

879
00:48:24,519 --> 00:48:27,681
there were all sorts of sort of hidden and unexpected costs

880
00:48:27,681 --> 00:48:33,323
where I had to, you know, suddenly pay for warm-up time and other things.

881
00:48:33,323 --> 00:48:34,204
I think, you know,

882
00:48:34,964 --> 00:48:37,026
every time you're making a choice,

883
00:48:37,026 --> 00:48:40,368
you're looking at it on the face of it.

884
00:48:40,368 --> 00:48:43,651
And while you may be playing a gotcha box

885
00:48:43,651 --> 00:48:46,093
with the intention of getting one particular item,

886
00:48:46,093 --> 00:48:47,674
if the game is doing it right,

887
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:50,276
then every time you pull it,

888
00:48:50,276 --> 00:48:51,777
you're getting something that you value.

889
00:48:51,777 --> 00:48:54,339
So you should be feeling like,

890
00:48:54,339 --> 00:48:56,821
I got a good deal with this gotcha pull,

891
00:48:56,821 --> 00:48:58,202
even if I didn't get what I wanted.

892
00:48:58,202 --> 00:49:01,724
I think that sort of framework

893
00:49:01,724 --> 00:49:04,687
of how we think about designing free-to-play.

894
00:49:05,367 --> 00:49:08,467
is actually part of sort of the humanized idea

895
00:49:08,467 --> 00:49:10,728
of spenders and spending.

896
00:49:10,728 --> 00:49:14,068
That if we're thinking about everybody

897
00:49:14,068 --> 00:49:16,989
as sort of rational and thoughtful,

898
00:49:16,989 --> 00:49:18,369
then we should be thinking about

899
00:49:18,369 --> 00:49:21,150
how they feel immediately about purchasing

900
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:25,711
and doing it in a way where it feels right every time.

901
00:49:25,711 --> 00:49:27,411
I'm not saying that that's exactly

902
00:49:27,411 --> 00:49:29,291
what's happening in every game,

903
00:49:29,291 --> 00:49:32,252
but for somebody to keep spending again and again and again,

904
00:49:32,252 --> 00:49:34,492
they must be feeling that they're getting a good value.

905
00:49:37,794 --> 00:49:39,755
What about variable ratio reinforcement?

906
00:49:39,755 --> 00:49:41,997
That's a hook that does keep people going,

907
00:49:41,997 --> 00:49:44,459
because it's a compelling feature that's

908
00:49:44,459 --> 00:49:45,740
hard to step away from.

909
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:48,582
That's what makes video slots work so well.

910
00:49:48,582 --> 00:49:50,903
And the top five of the top games in the top 25

911
00:49:50,903 --> 00:49:51,604
are straight up.

912
00:49:51,604 --> 00:49:56,547
So what I would say is you're buying an experience.

913
00:49:56,547 --> 00:49:58,068
If you're enjoying that experience, then

914
00:49:58,068 --> 00:49:59,490
you're getting the value of it.

915
00:49:59,490 --> 00:50:02,352
So I don't think saying something.

916
00:50:03,151 --> 00:50:06,592
An element that makes it more enjoyable for you to play,

917
00:50:06,592 --> 00:50:09,693
and enjoyable to spend, that's making the game into a spend,

918
00:50:09,693 --> 00:50:13,334
is part of the entertainment of what you're doing.

919
00:50:13,334 --> 00:50:15,515
And we should trust that that is,

920
00:50:15,515 --> 00:50:19,376
that the person is making that decision.

921
00:50:21,443 --> 00:50:24,227
and enjoying it at that level.

922
00:50:24,227 --> 00:50:25,489
Again, as I mentioned,

923
00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:28,913
spend tends to be extremely even across time periods,

924
00:50:28,913 --> 00:50:31,897
which shows that people are having

925
00:50:31,897 --> 00:50:34,180
sort of controlled reactions

926
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:36,683
and thinking thoughtfully about what they're spending.

927
00:50:40,097 --> 00:50:48,747
Do you think it makes a moral difference for the games that purposefully try to get those really top-end spenders to make more purchases,

928
00:50:48,747 --> 00:50:56,656
like psychological things in the game sort of try to pinch them in and try to just almost force them to buy something to continue for those really high-end spenders?

929
00:50:57,583 --> 00:51:00,784
I think the games that do that are driving away their big spenders.

930
00:51:00,784 --> 00:51:10,309
I think that the feeling of being forced to do something is sort of one of the most unpleasant

931
00:51:10,309 --> 00:51:14,031
ways that you can go about monetizing.

932
00:51:14,031 --> 00:51:19,514
And that games that do that are probably, actually don't have the highest number of

933
00:51:19,514 --> 00:51:19,994
spenders.

934
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:22,436
Like, you want positive incentives.

935
00:51:23,136 --> 00:51:30,923
competition to drive spending.

936
00:51:30,923 --> 00:51:35,767
I don't think pinch points are not, from my perspective,

937
00:51:35,767 --> 00:51:38,429
not a terribly effective way of monetizing and not really

938
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:40,651
directed at big spenders.

939
00:51:40,651 --> 00:51:44,854
I think pinch points tend to be about getting $5 from everybody.

940
00:51:44,854 --> 00:51:47,136
Like you get to a certain point, and now we're

941
00:51:47,136 --> 00:51:47,917
going to get that first $5.

942
00:51:49,418 --> 00:51:50,539
you can leave.

943
00:51:50,539 --> 00:51:52,200
And as you saw, somebody spending $5 or $10 once

944
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,881
doesn't add up to very much in the long term.

945
00:51:53,881 --> 00:51:56,403
And so I think that kind of monetization is a mistake.

946
00:51:56,403 --> 00:51:56,723
All right.

947
00:51:56,723 --> 00:51:56,783
Hi.

948
00:51:56,783 --> 00:51:57,544
I was wondering if any of your data

949
00:51:57,544 --> 00:51:58,544
shows that if a similar genre of game

950
00:51:58,544 --> 00:52:00,085
was introduced into your market?

951
00:52:11,495 --> 00:52:15,556
if there was a siphoning of spending towards that new game,

952
00:52:15,556 --> 00:52:17,997
or if there was some sort of loyalty to a game

953
00:52:17,997 --> 00:52:20,358
that was already invested, like people were investing in?

954
00:52:20,358 --> 00:52:25,480
There's intense loyalty.

955
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:28,882
So when we started, we have this broad platform

956
00:52:28,882 --> 00:52:31,042
where we're advertising a lot of games,

957
00:52:31,042 --> 00:52:33,103
and when we first started having games be successful,

958
00:52:33,103 --> 00:52:34,324
one of our concerns was

959
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,542
If we show somebody another game,

960
00:52:37,542 --> 00:52:41,366
are we going to just cannibalize sales and move them across?

961
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:46,550
And what we find is that our sales have increased really

962
00:52:46,550 --> 00:52:49,653
steadily over the years, because people find the games that they

963
00:52:49,653 --> 00:52:51,735
really care about, and they spend in those,

964
00:52:51,735 --> 00:52:53,337
and they stay in those.

965
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:57,480
And it's relatively rare to shake them from that loyalty.

966
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:59,142
Again, you saw that in that big spender data

967
00:52:59,142 --> 00:53:01,564
that most people had one game that they spent on.

968
00:53:02,299 --> 00:53:12,946
The situation where that's not true is where a game isn't being supported and new content

969
00:53:12,946 --> 00:53:18,810
isn't being released, the event cycle has died, there's not any new features.

970
00:53:18,810 --> 00:53:23,113
At that point, there is a vulnerable point where if a good new game in that same genre

971
00:53:23,113 --> 00:53:26,395
comes in, then you will see a bunch of people jump over.

972
00:53:26,395 --> 00:53:30,698
But generally, if somebody is spending a significant amount in the game...

973
00:53:31,803 --> 00:53:33,844
They're not leaving. Thank you

974
00:53:33,844 --> 00:53:36,306
Thanks Emily great talk

975
00:53:36,306 --> 00:53:43,871
So you mentioned that in the games you have the the ability to really anchor

976
00:53:43,871 --> 00:53:45,492
Your own prices

977
00:53:45,492 --> 00:53:51,476
But as we see more and more games of the same genre coming out with the same types of purchases going on

978
00:53:51,476 --> 00:53:58,500
Do you think that's gonna put at risk that that like the competition can now anchor the price say of like your hero or something?

979
00:53:59,001 --> 00:54:03,883
I think it may influence it for that first purchase.

980
00:54:03,883 --> 00:54:06,764
And certainly I think we've seen it most in card games,

981
00:54:06,764 --> 00:54:11,506
where cards are amongst the easiest things to sort of understand buying and to compare.

982
00:54:12,734 --> 00:54:16,596
We'll see card games that come out that are pricing cards at more like $7 and $10,

983
00:54:16,596 --> 00:54:22,179
and then there'll be the complaint, no, so Magic prices it at this, et cetera.

984
00:54:22,179 --> 00:54:23,940
But those games still do well.

985
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:29,023
Essentially, what happens is then if you're price comparing,

986
00:54:29,023 --> 00:54:32,585
you're already probably not loving the game.

987
00:54:33,265 --> 00:54:35,527
and by the time that you have spent more time in it,

988
00:54:35,527 --> 00:54:43,053
again, you value that card more than that other game.

989
00:54:43,053 --> 00:54:48,417
I do think that it's important to keep prices,

990
00:54:48,417 --> 00:54:51,439
there's sort of like a careful happy band

991
00:54:51,439 --> 00:54:55,602
between high enough that you're not just

992
00:54:55,602 --> 00:54:57,784
sort of giving away money because things are.

993
00:55:01,949 --> 00:55:03,950
inelastic, but you also don't want to,

994
00:55:03,950 --> 00:55:06,432
you never want the player to feel that they're being

995
00:55:06,432 --> 00:55:09,553
taken advantage of or that they're being,

996
00:55:09,553 --> 00:55:11,755
they're not getting good value.

997
00:55:11,755 --> 00:55:13,415
And that's what you should always concentrate on

998
00:55:13,415 --> 00:55:16,577
is that feeling of value and you probably want to keep

999
00:55:16,577 --> 00:55:18,318
things more at like, you know, $15 or $20 to spend,

1000
00:55:18,318 --> 00:55:20,079
but you get a lot of stuff and you feel really great.

1001
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:21,760
Like, to me, that's how it should be working.

1002
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:22,300
Cool, thank you.

1003
00:55:25,193 --> 00:55:44,863
So lovely talk, thank you. I am curious, I suspect I know where you're headed with this, but your thoughts on the paid incentive advertising, such as some of the services that the mobile publisher I was with would use, and whether you think that's a good concept from the advertiser's standpoint as opposed from the company making revenue from it.

1004
00:55:45,724 --> 00:55:49,826
No, I think well executed, they're great.

1005
00:55:49,826 --> 00:55:56,489
I think it's important to design them in ways that they're not competing directly with what

1006
00:55:56,489 --> 00:55:58,089
you would actually spend in-app purchase on.

1007
00:55:58,089 --> 00:55:59,870
We've done some A-B tests and seen where

1008
00:56:02,171 --> 00:56:05,635
if we made our offers more prominent overall

1009
00:56:05,635 --> 00:56:07,958
and we'd see an increase in offer revenue

1010
00:56:07,958 --> 00:56:09,920
and then a total decrease.

1011
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:12,083
But I don't think it has to be that way.

1012
00:56:12,083 --> 00:56:14,946
One great example is our most recent game,

1013
00:56:14,946 --> 00:56:15,987
Adventure Capitalist.

1014
00:56:15,987 --> 00:56:17,069
I don't know if you've played that game.

1015
00:56:18,512 --> 00:56:24,718
But most of the in-app purchases are sort of speed-ups of, you know, 3x permanent speed-ups.

1016
00:56:24,718 --> 00:56:31,205
But you can get a 2x 4-hour speed-up just by watching an ad.

1017
00:56:31,205 --> 00:56:36,731
And I go into that game and it's just part of sort of the optimization that I do every time is that I watch an ad.

1018
00:56:37,332 --> 00:56:38,612
I'm really happy to see it.

1019
00:56:38,612 --> 00:56:42,594
We get lots of complaints from players saying,

1020
00:56:42,594 --> 00:56:44,014
oh, my ads aren't working, because they really

1021
00:56:44,014 --> 00:56:45,275
like the system.

1022
00:56:45,275 --> 00:56:47,156
But at the same time, we're seeing really good results

1023
00:56:47,156 --> 00:56:48,016
on the in-app purchases.

1024
00:56:48,016 --> 00:56:51,398
So I think if designed well, they're very complimentary.

1025
00:56:51,398 --> 00:56:54,439
But it is important to think about the relative value

1026
00:56:54,439 --> 00:56:55,319
of one ad versus somebody spending $2 or $3.

1027
00:57:05,770 --> 00:57:07,717
Great, it's three o'clock, so I have to get down anyway.
