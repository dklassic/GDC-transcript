1
00:00:11,732 --> 00:00:13,474
Hello all, thank you all for coming to the talk.

2
00:00:14,075 --> 00:00:15,636
I'm extremely excited to be here.

3
00:00:15,656 --> 00:00:18,959
This is the design direction of I Expect You to Die Too.

4
00:00:18,979 --> 00:00:21,082
And I'm Francisco Zucchi,

5
00:00:21,222 --> 00:00:23,184
I'm a principal game designer at Shell Games.

6
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:25,646
I was a design director for I Expect You to Die Too,

7
00:00:25,686 --> 00:00:28,289
and I've been at Shell for a long time now,

8
00:00:28,309 --> 00:00:31,312
about 12 years, worked on a plethora of projects.

9
00:00:32,113 --> 00:00:33,114
But we're here to talk about...

10
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:34,911
I expected to die.

11
00:00:36,811 --> 00:00:39,272
We are currently number three top rated Quest game

12
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:40,412
as of February 2022.

13
00:00:40,912 --> 00:00:42,472
Obviously, extremely happy with the game

14
00:00:42,552 --> 00:00:43,533
and how the game turned out.

15
00:00:44,533 --> 00:00:48,734
And today, I'm going to cover specifically the design

16
00:00:48,774 --> 00:00:52,435
direction from a project management perspective.

17
00:00:52,495 --> 00:00:54,175
So a little bit about I expected to die.

18
00:00:54,595 --> 00:00:57,556
We are a VR puzzle game, six levels total.

19
00:00:57,916 --> 00:00:59,476
And the design team that I was running

20
00:00:59,696 --> 00:01:03,397
was at its largest, about six people plus myself.

21
00:01:03,917 --> 00:01:08,921
But on average, I was in charge of a team of about four game designers plus me.

22
00:01:10,282 --> 00:01:14,926
Like I said, this is primarily a management track talk through the lens of the design director.

23
00:01:15,006 --> 00:01:17,569
So I'm not going to be covering puzzle design.

24
00:01:17,629 --> 00:01:19,390
I'm not covering gameplay.

25
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,593
I would happily cover that in a different talk.

26
00:01:22,973 --> 00:01:24,234
I love nerding out about puzzles.

27
00:01:24,554 --> 00:01:25,976
But today we're going to talk about.

28
00:01:26,516 --> 00:01:28,099
creating the schedule for the game.

29
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:31,444
And mostly we're going to talk about process

30
00:01:31,684 --> 00:01:32,826
and planning challenges

31
00:01:33,407 --> 00:01:35,971
and how we solve those process and planning challenges.

32
00:01:36,532 --> 00:01:39,777
Again, these are specifically the design director portion

33
00:01:40,518 --> 00:01:41,420
of those processes.

34
00:01:43,124 --> 00:01:45,106
You will once in a while see a slide like this one.

35
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:46,308
These are my key takeaways.

36
00:01:46,788 --> 00:01:48,370
And there's another slide at the end.

37
00:01:48,911 --> 00:01:49,531
And just so you know,

38
00:01:49,612 --> 00:01:51,754
I will be sharing all these slides in a PDF.

39
00:01:51,934 --> 00:01:53,296
So there's gonna be a link at the end

40
00:01:53,336 --> 00:01:54,197
as well as on the vault.

41
00:01:54,597 --> 00:01:55,979
So, you know, feel free to take pictures,

42
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:59,603
but there will be a PDF shared at the end.

43
00:01:59,623 --> 00:02:00,564
So no pressure there.

44
00:02:01,365 --> 00:02:05,307
So, you know, this is my first takeaway. Just a very simple one. These are the things I value

45
00:02:05,347 --> 00:02:11,091
in my teammates. Civility, tolerance, and respect. You will notice that skill isn't ranked particularly

46
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:17,674
high in this list. And, you know, this is just speaking about the type of people I like to

47
00:02:18,315 --> 00:02:20,676
make games with. These are the non-negotiables.

48
00:02:21,377 --> 00:02:25,985
You know, in that note, these are those type of people who are part of my team,

49
00:02:26,085 --> 00:02:29,572
who I am extremely grateful to and without whom we, of course,

50
00:02:29,652 --> 00:02:31,355
could not have been able to to make the game.

51
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:37,229
Let's get right into it. Let's get right into making this game and how that went.

52
00:02:37,649 --> 00:02:40,772
So let's start with pre-production and what we knew going in.

53
00:02:41,012 --> 00:02:43,354
We knew we wanted a game that was six levels long,

54
00:02:44,034 --> 00:02:46,056
and we knew what I call the size of the box.

55
00:02:46,436 --> 00:02:51,440
This is, you know, the schedule length and the resources we had at our disposal.

56
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:52,261
And...

57
00:02:52,861 --> 00:02:57,343
We were trying to plan the game to fit in this box. Of course, we started with pre-production.

58
00:02:57,443 --> 00:03:00,904
That's where this is happening. It's a very quick note about pre-production

59
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:06,386
is that because we were a sequel, we did not have to dedicate pre-production time

60
00:03:07,147 --> 00:03:12,429
to anything like exploring new core mechanics or anything like that. It was mostly about

61
00:03:12,809 --> 00:03:15,810
new ways to tell the content that we wanted to put in the game.

62
00:03:17,104 --> 00:03:21,307
Then we have this crazy theory that we were just going to make everything sequentially.

63
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:25,970
We're going to make three levels and then we're going to have a separate team, a separate pod,

64
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:30,794
making three more levels and then, you know, we'll have a six-level game.

65
00:03:31,914 --> 00:03:32,855
What can go wrong?

66
00:03:33,415 --> 00:03:36,718
And in parallel, we're going to have what's called the meta pod,

67
00:03:37,658 --> 00:03:40,280
which is just a teamwork and all the meta features for the game.

68
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:45,743
Once all of this is in, we're going to polish it all, kind of QA it all, port it,

69
00:03:46,243 --> 00:03:46,904
and we have a game.

70
00:03:46,944 --> 00:03:49,445
So we're armed with a schedule and this is the schedule that we

71
00:03:49,485 --> 00:03:51,086
walked into production with.

72
00:03:53,508 --> 00:03:55,268
Let's talk about making a specific level.

73
00:03:55,589 --> 00:03:58,430
We would split our level making into three phases.

74
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:01,092
Nothing, you know, groundbreaking here is a pre-production and

75
00:04:01,212 --> 00:04:03,933
alpha and a beta for, for each level.

76
00:04:05,094 --> 00:04:05,194
And.

77
00:04:06,568 --> 00:04:08,209
I do want to talk about this idea of buffer.

78
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:11,052
I am a huge fan of planning out my projects

79
00:04:11,092 --> 00:04:12,453
with buffer at the end.

80
00:04:13,054 --> 00:04:14,816
Buffer is not polish.

81
00:04:15,036 --> 00:04:20,821
Buffer is a chunk of time that you would be totally okay

82
00:04:21,362 --> 00:04:23,504
if it just disappeared into the ether.

83
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:25,526
Something happened and you just took your buffer away,

84
00:04:26,407 --> 00:04:26,987
you would be happy.

85
00:04:27,047 --> 00:04:29,449
So you want to plan with buffer because things will happen.

86
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:34,892
For this specific game, we did something a little different, which is instead of putting the buffer

87
00:04:34,932 --> 00:04:40,154
at the end, we sprinkled it throughout the different level milestones. So one week of

88
00:04:40,234 --> 00:04:45,916
buffer at each milestone, the theory there being that teams could reclaim the buffer if they needed

89
00:04:45,956 --> 00:04:53,419
it, or they could bank it for a future level if they didn't need it. But what are our design

90
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:58,720
goals in pre-production? Pretty simple, just plan everything. This is a lot of planning and a lot

91
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,101
of figuring out what we're making.

92
00:05:01,102 --> 00:05:03,505
was one main problem though for me during pre-production,

93
00:05:04,326 --> 00:05:06,289
which is that I did not work on the first game.

94
00:05:06,329 --> 00:05:08,472
I was not part of that team in any way.

95
00:05:08,712 --> 00:05:11,035
So imagine you're me, you're walking into Shell Games,

96
00:05:11,315 --> 00:05:13,899
it's 2019, so you're physically walking into the office

97
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,381
first day of the project,

98
00:05:16,022 --> 00:05:17,544
and you're tasked with making a sequel,

99
00:05:17,724 --> 00:05:18,004
and you...

100
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:20,671
You really did not work on the first one.

101
00:05:20,691 --> 00:05:23,692
So you have to figure out sort of what it is that you're making.

102
00:05:24,453 --> 00:05:29,555
I, I, I liken it to like, imagine you sit at a restaurant and you're served a pizza

103
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:33,577
and you bite into the pizza and then you're told right now you have to make a pizza.

104
00:05:34,317 --> 00:05:35,558
So what, what did I do?

105
00:05:35,618 --> 00:05:37,999
How did I go about making this pizza?

106
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,419
What I decided to do was.

107
00:05:40,592 --> 00:05:44,016
talk to anyone that has opinions about pizza.

108
00:05:44,076 --> 00:05:45,458
So capital O opinions,

109
00:05:45,598 --> 00:05:47,781
people who have opinions about I Expect You To Die,

110
00:05:47,801 --> 00:05:49,302
people from the first team,

111
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:52,446
maybe people from the studio leadership,

112
00:05:52,706 --> 00:05:54,268
people who just are fans of the game.

113
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:55,710
And I started to collect,

114
00:05:57,292 --> 00:06:00,255
what to you makes an I Expect You To Die level?

115
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:06,181
I collected all this information and I put it into, you know, different categories.

116
00:06:06,701 --> 00:06:10,042
And with those categories, I build what I call the master design guide.

117
00:06:10,122 --> 00:06:16,864
So a master design guide is a 60 item checklist of things that make a level feel like an I

118
00:06:16,904 --> 00:06:17,884
expect you to die level.

119
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:22,786
You know, if you check every single one of those, theoretically, you have something that

120
00:06:22,826 --> 00:06:25,227
kind of looks and feels like an I expect you to die level, right?

121
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:26,707
We're going back to the pizza.

122
00:06:26,767 --> 00:06:29,068
This is, you know, you would have things like.

123
00:06:29,608 --> 00:06:31,169
You know, probably has some cheese in it.

124
00:06:31,489 --> 00:06:32,630
Maybe it has tomato sauce.

125
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,592
It has some amount of toppings.

126
00:06:34,632 --> 00:06:35,292
You can hold it.

127
00:06:35,412 --> 00:06:38,354
You can bite into it and not burn your mouth, right?

128
00:06:39,255 --> 00:06:41,477
So it's not a recipe for making the level.

129
00:06:41,617 --> 00:06:44,839
It's a list of characteristics that each one of these levels

130
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:45,500
will have.

131
00:06:47,681 --> 00:06:48,842
This is a template that I used.

132
00:06:49,963 --> 00:06:53,466
And the key thing here is that because this is a checklist,

133
00:06:53,486 --> 00:06:57,108
we have to decide when were we going to check.

134
00:06:58,112 --> 00:07:03,693
that we have everything on the list. So we settled on at the end of every milestone for every level,

135
00:07:03,713 --> 00:07:08,855
so at the end of pre-pro, end of alpha, end of beta. I'm sure one more time at the end of the

136
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:13,336
project might not. We're going to do a check against each single one of these items and

137
00:07:13,356 --> 00:07:17,637
everything that we weren't meeting was going to be tagged in yellow. Here's an example of

138
00:07:18,922 --> 00:07:24,946
some of the things that you could find in this document. And it spanned everything from puzzle

139
00:07:24,966 --> 00:07:29,228
design all the way through to accessibility considerations, right? So we're talking about,

140
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:33,591
you know, things like are players invited to look around? Are deaths getting players closer to the

141
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:38,094
solution? You know, are people confused in any way by, you know, where the clues are or how we're

142
00:07:38,134 --> 00:07:42,757
leading them to cleverness? But also accessibility considerations like can this be completed

143
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:46,539
one-handed? You know, et cetera. Here's a little example there at the bottom.

144
00:07:48,567 --> 00:07:53,249
of one of these questions that we weren't meeting in alpha, so we tag it yellow.

145
00:07:53,529 --> 00:07:57,471
Hopefully by the time we come in into beta and work on the level again,

146
00:07:57,491 --> 00:08:01,453
that specific item will be addressed.

147
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:11,519
On the topic of accessibility, this is another notable document that we used to plan in pre-production.

148
00:08:12,941 --> 00:08:16,924
And the problem we were trying to solve with this one was that we historically at Shell Games

149
00:08:17,145 --> 00:08:22,970
have not been particularly good at accessibility, especially up until 2019 when we started getting

150
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:27,234
more serious about it. So in an effort to combat that,

151
00:08:28,095 --> 00:08:31,356
We worked out a process with the product team at Shell

152
00:08:31,856 --> 00:08:35,378
that results in a list of all the accessibility considerations

153
00:08:35,478 --> 00:08:36,318
and design decisions.

154
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:40,240
And those go back to the master guide, to that pizza document.

155
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,741
Right?

156
00:08:42,161 --> 00:08:45,462
This can be and is actually all other GDC talk.

157
00:08:45,622 --> 00:08:47,763
So on Friday, Alexis Miller and I

158
00:08:47,783 --> 00:08:51,405
are going to be covering how we use this document

159
00:08:51,445 --> 00:08:52,745
and how this document was created.

160
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:58,729
There's a quick peek at what the document, you know, part of the document looks like.

161
00:08:58,749 --> 00:09:03,492
It's just a giant list of about 30, 35 different accessibility considerations.

162
00:09:03,912 --> 00:09:06,893
And the goal is you want to look at these as early as possible

163
00:09:07,273 --> 00:09:10,895
so you can weave them into your project planning.

164
00:09:12,303 --> 00:09:14,945
For us, this meant putting it in the pizza document, right?

165
00:09:14,965 --> 00:09:17,047
Putting in that design master guide.

166
00:09:17,627 --> 00:09:20,430
And again, checking at every milestone how we were doing,

167
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,951
and then everything that we weren't hitting,

168
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:24,773
we tag in yellow, make sure to come back later.

169
00:09:26,855 --> 00:09:28,837
You all probably are familiar with game pillars.

170
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,338
There was no problem solved here.

171
00:09:32,374 --> 00:09:35,177
asked ourselves, do we like the pillars from the first game?

172
00:09:35,257 --> 00:09:37,440
And actually, yeah, no, they're great. We love them.

173
00:09:37,821 --> 00:09:38,521
They're beautiful.

174
00:09:38,602 --> 00:09:41,926
They have served us well, and they continued to serve us well

175
00:09:42,046 --> 00:09:42,787
throughout development.

176
00:09:43,227 --> 00:09:46,532
So we took the decision to not touch the pillars.

177
00:09:46,672 --> 00:09:47,633
We're going to keep them.

178
00:09:49,698 --> 00:09:54,200
So that was pre-production and armed with all this knowledge,

179
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,261
we set on to make our first two levels.

180
00:09:57,482 --> 00:09:59,142
All right, so the goals of this phase,

181
00:09:59,823 --> 00:10:01,663
we're just, you know, let's make two levels

182
00:10:01,723 --> 00:10:02,504
and see where we're at.

183
00:10:02,804 --> 00:10:04,865
See if these levels we make kind of feel

184
00:10:04,905 --> 00:10:06,626
like unexpected high level or not.

185
00:10:07,546 --> 00:10:09,147
So we're excited and then.

186
00:10:10,362 --> 00:10:14,405
March, 2020 happens and we are not excited anymore.

187
00:10:14,606 --> 00:10:15,687
We are all at home.

188
00:10:16,367 --> 00:10:19,289
So I don't have to explain to any of you what happened in March, 2020, we were,

189
00:10:19,329 --> 00:10:24,734
you know, in the alpha phase for both of our levels, we had to go home and, you

190
00:10:24,774 --> 00:10:29,217
know, looking back in retrospect about how much time it took us to regain our

191
00:10:29,297 --> 00:10:34,622
footing, it was about an, an extra four to six weeks that just disappeared into

192
00:10:34,642 --> 00:10:35,222
the ether.

193
00:10:35,282 --> 00:10:36,543
So what does it mean?

194
00:10:36,563 --> 00:10:37,524
Does it bring it to the ether?

195
00:10:37,564 --> 00:10:38,625
Well, it means that.

196
00:10:39,726 --> 00:10:44,499
all of that beautiful, beautiful buffer time we had planned for the whole project.

197
00:10:48,072 --> 00:10:56,494
chop it. We essentially were left without room for error. Now, this put us in a way better situation

198
00:10:56,534 --> 00:11:00,615
than the majority of teams around the world, right, that were working from home at this time,

199
00:11:00,635 --> 00:11:06,177
that were trying to adjust. Because we had planned for that buffer, and so this just meant that we

200
00:11:06,297 --> 00:11:12,818
used the buffer. But we were still, theoretically, if nothing else went horribly wrong, scheduled to

201
00:11:12,918 --> 00:11:15,379
ship at about the same time that we were planning.

202
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:23,046
Um, something to keep in mind here is that at Shell games, we seriously, as much as we can,

203
00:11:23,106 --> 00:11:30,910
disincentivize crunch. Uh, I don't crunch. I try to get my team to crunch the least amount. There's

204
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:36,173
just no crunch. If you must work extra hours, I would like to know so that we can find ways for

205
00:11:36,213 --> 00:11:37,393
you to recover those hours later.

206
00:11:38,748 --> 00:11:44,257
And that meant that if anything else went wrong, we had no room for error.

207
00:11:44,518 --> 00:11:50,547
So the game was going to have to downsize, or we were going to have to go to leadership and request more resources for the game.

208
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:57,218
So, you know, through this work from home, it was hard on a lot of us.

209
00:11:57,838 --> 00:12:04,523
And, you know, looking back at that period, I think that what was the most,

210
00:12:05,764 --> 00:12:10,187
the biggest need we had at that time was a need for stability of any kind.

211
00:12:10,547 --> 00:12:15,671
There was so much out of our control in all of our lives that every single

212
00:12:15,711 --> 00:12:20,395
developer was just looking for something in this project to hold on to something

213
00:12:20,415 --> 00:12:22,516
they could predict and something they could control.

214
00:12:23,965 --> 00:12:33,953
In many ways that reflected itself in changes to process to try to help people regain some of that

215
00:12:34,013 --> 00:12:38,657
control. Some of that we got right, some of that we got wrong, and there's two big lessons to learn

216
00:12:38,697 --> 00:12:46,523
from that adjustment. The first one in game development processes is that

217
00:12:47,817 --> 00:12:52,918
processes impact people's lives directly, your developers' lives. So what I mean by this is,

218
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:56,939
you know, if you imagine your game that you make, your players are going to play your game using a

219
00:12:57,359 --> 00:13:01,981
game controller, using a headset. Your developers, when they make the game, they make it with a

220
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:09,023
combination of tools and processes. And these processes, this is scrum, this is daily meetings,

221
00:13:09,123 --> 00:13:12,264
this is daily reviews or general reviews, this is...

222
00:13:12,924 --> 00:13:19,486
Like, all the meetings, all the ways in which your team is interfacing with the game development.

223
00:13:20,707 --> 00:13:28,450
And as a process holder, if you're a director, you should be very careful about meddling

224
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:29,170
with process.

225
00:13:30,937 --> 00:13:36,963
It has the potential to have direct impact in someone's lives or someone's emotional state to

226
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:41,628
the point of like, what time do they wake up? How do they plan their day? How do they expect

227
00:13:41,668 --> 00:13:47,413
their work to be reviewed and when? The classic example here of getting this wrong for us is

228
00:13:49,001 --> 00:13:55,567
Some of us, when the pandemic started, had a stark need for more social time, and some of us had a

229
00:13:55,828 --> 00:14:03,695
stark need for no social time, right? And some of our process changes were sort of optimizing for

230
00:14:04,015 --> 00:14:07,399
the team being together and supporting each other and spending more time with each other,

231
00:14:07,419 --> 00:14:09,821
and that was just not what some of us needed.

232
00:14:12,687 --> 00:14:14,488
The way to counter this that I would recommend

233
00:14:14,768 --> 00:14:17,350
is to default to involving the team in all of these decisions.

234
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,891
Your dream state should be that if you're

235
00:14:19,911 --> 00:14:22,773
going to roll out a new process, by the time

236
00:14:22,813 --> 00:14:24,014
you're rolling it out to the team,

237
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,455
every single person in that room that

238
00:14:26,495 --> 00:14:29,197
is affected by that process knows what's coming,

239
00:14:30,277 --> 00:14:32,318
was consulted, and had an opportunity

240
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:33,839
to give feedback on that process.

241
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:35,880
So you're not really imparting any new information.

242
00:14:36,581 --> 00:14:39,182
You are just pretty much telling them

243
00:14:39,222 --> 00:14:39,983
something they already know.

244
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:49,560
So, you know, we had that rattling and we powered through it and eventually we ended

245
00:14:49,661 --> 00:14:54,484
up at what felt like two levels, you know, you're going to have to squint.

246
00:14:54,524 --> 00:14:58,227
You kind of had to like blindfold yourself and take a bite of that pizza and be like.

247
00:14:58,929 --> 00:15:04,371
Yeah, this could technically be pizza if I think about it really hard.

248
00:15:05,332 --> 00:15:06,972
But it felt like a big success for us.

249
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:09,253
Again, these are the first levels many of us were making.

250
00:15:10,694 --> 00:15:13,195
And we were calibrated to the rhythm of what we were making.

251
00:15:13,315 --> 00:15:17,537
It really felt like the first stage of the project was completed.

252
00:15:18,577 --> 00:15:24,719
And armed with that confidence, we marched into the next stage of the project,

253
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,640
which is four more levels.

254
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:28,878
So let's make four more levels.

255
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:30,059
That's our goal.

256
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:33,320
And before we go and make these four more levels,

257
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,561
we're gonna take a little bit of stock here.

258
00:15:39,443 --> 00:15:43,005
This stage of the project, the four more levels stage,

259
00:15:43,865 --> 00:15:49,047
is where we have the most impactful process adjustment.

260
00:15:49,107 --> 00:15:52,549
I call it the great adjustment state or stage.

261
00:15:53,589 --> 00:15:56,611
It is what the majority of the stock will cover.

262
00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:06,116
And it is a period of learning from that first figure out what we're making and getting ready

263
00:16:06,156 --> 00:16:15,359
for the next stage of just making everything. And this adjustment period, uh, we framed in

264
00:16:15,419 --> 00:16:21,421
terms of solving some very specific problems. So here's that, here's the takeaway and something

265
00:16:21,501 --> 00:16:27,123
that you will see reflected all the way cascading through this talk is alignment on the problem to

266
00:16:27,163 --> 00:16:27,383
solve.

267
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:33,880
So what I mean by alignment on the problem to solve is try to get your team and try to get

268
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,929
yourself as much as possible out of solution space, out of solution brain, solution mind.

269
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:46,739
if you are, or if you, if you lead them to be more problem oriented and you can get everyone to agree

270
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:51,984
on the problem, then first you activate their solution brain in a much better way, which is

271
00:16:52,024 --> 00:16:58,910
not just solving whatever problem affects them, but solving the general problem.

272
00:17:00,332 --> 00:17:05,436
Let's talk about some general problems. So this is a big one.

273
00:17:06,801 --> 00:17:10,164
And it is the one that pretty much keeps me up at night.

274
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:16,408
This is the design team is hungry for more guidance, but as a design director,

275
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:22,332
my role is to provide that guidance with a light touch and in a way that doesn't steal.

276
00:17:23,274 --> 00:17:26,737
from their creative freedom and their creative agency.

277
00:17:27,257 --> 00:17:32,642
Like I said, if I'm going to be sitting at night in bed thinking I'm an imposter,

278
00:17:33,323 --> 00:17:38,508
what have I done? How did I get this job? It's going to be because I'm going to be thinking back

279
00:17:39,489 --> 00:17:42,672
to this specific problem like 95% of the time.

280
00:17:42,692 --> 00:17:42,732
So

281
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:51,063
Let's talk about some lessons that I learned in providing guidance and

282
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,604
providing creative freedom to my team.

283
00:17:55,165 --> 00:18:01,049
The first lesson is that every single one of your teammates is a different

284
00:18:01,069 --> 00:18:04,391
human and needs something different.

285
00:18:05,232 --> 00:18:08,834
What I mean by that is not everyone likes to take direction in the same way.

286
00:18:09,615 --> 00:18:12,016
Not everyone likes to.

287
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:18,003
to provide creativity or to be creative in the same way.

288
00:18:18,523 --> 00:18:21,765
So there is not one solution fits all.

289
00:18:21,925 --> 00:18:25,167
You will have to learn about the humans in your team

290
00:18:25,487 --> 00:18:29,130
and treat them like humans and engage in that conversation

291
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,711
in a way that fits them.

292
00:18:32,892 --> 00:18:33,512
So get to know them.

293
00:18:35,053 --> 00:18:35,954
The second one, however,

294
00:18:36,334 --> 00:18:38,335
is avoid having too light of a touch.

295
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:45,999
So this one's especially useful for me because I tend to be the type of person who is more likely

296
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:52,406
to lean back and let people be creative than to give too strong of a direction.

297
00:18:52,617 --> 00:18:56,799
However, what I've started to realize is that

298
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,181
that is doing a different type of disservice to your team.

299
00:19:00,882 --> 00:19:02,943
There is a reason if you're the design director

300
00:19:03,503 --> 00:19:04,764
that you are the design director.

301
00:19:04,784 --> 00:19:07,265
It usually has to do with experience or passion

302
00:19:07,745 --> 00:19:09,586
or with a gift or a strength that you have.

303
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:15,148
And not only is your team expecting that direction, but they will learn from you and

304
00:19:15,168 --> 00:19:19,090
they will grow to be better developers by watching you provide direction.

305
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:25,912
So you're doing a disservice to the team and to the game by depriving them of your expertise.

306
00:19:26,552 --> 00:19:27,172
So don't do that.

307
00:19:30,133 --> 00:19:35,015
A big takeaway for me was to expose your decision-making process as much as possible.

308
00:19:35,715 --> 00:19:36,436
What I mean by this is...

309
00:19:38,382 --> 00:19:43,163
Presumably, presumably, when you make a decision,

310
00:19:43,323 --> 00:19:46,704
you don't just pull it out of thin air, right?

311
00:19:47,204 --> 00:19:49,085
You go through some process in your mind

312
00:19:49,185 --> 00:19:50,585
and you arrive at a conclusion,

313
00:19:50,645 --> 00:19:52,685
and that conclusion leads you to making that decision.

314
00:19:53,746 --> 00:19:54,946
If you can capture the process

315
00:19:55,706 --> 00:19:58,367
and then speak it out loud to your team,

316
00:19:59,967 --> 00:20:01,867
you're going to do them such a favor.

317
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:03,008
Why?

318
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:03,648
Well, first,

319
00:20:05,244 --> 00:20:09,417
Team members tend to be stressed if they can't predict more or less what you're going to say.

320
00:20:10,554 --> 00:20:14,356
Second, by you exposing your thought process,

321
00:20:14,837 --> 00:20:17,178
your solution-finding process, they

322
00:20:17,218 --> 00:20:20,660
will get to replicate it next time when they're

323
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,000
putting the next thing in the game.

324
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,402
So they're going to be able to say, OK,

325
00:20:25,582 --> 00:20:27,964
what did Francisco want here last time?

326
00:20:28,924 --> 00:20:33,427
And how can I sort of preempt that to, or adopt

327
00:20:33,487 --> 00:20:36,068
his decision-making, adopt his thought process

328
00:20:36,608 --> 00:20:39,890
to make sure that I am successful faster next time?

329
00:20:42,139 --> 00:20:44,400
And then it's just going to create alignment much faster.

330
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,780
Here's a quick example of, you know, very quickly.

331
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,801
One thing I threw together one day is we were having this giant play test and we're getting

332
00:20:52,281 --> 00:20:54,722
lots of data in from players, lots of data.

333
00:20:55,382 --> 00:20:57,622
And the team was getting a little stressed because they were like, what are we going

334
00:20:57,642 --> 00:20:58,382
to do with all this data?

335
00:20:59,063 --> 00:21:02,443
And to them, I was just making decisions randomly.

336
00:21:02,503 --> 00:21:06,464
I was saying, we're going to listen to that feedback and that feedback and that feedback,

337
00:21:07,044 --> 00:21:10,045
but they didn't see any rhyme operation.

338
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,202
for or to how I was making those decisions.

339
00:21:13,422 --> 00:21:16,284
So I put together a really quick diagram

340
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:19,105
and I said, right, here's what I'm doing.

341
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,488
If we're getting lots of data

342
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:24,189
pointing in one specific direction

343
00:21:25,069 --> 00:21:26,370
and that direction is low scope,

344
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,611
I'm gonna take that without telling anyone.

345
00:21:28,832 --> 00:21:30,012
I'm not gonna consult anyone.

346
00:21:30,052 --> 00:21:31,013
I'm gonna say, let's do it.

347
00:21:31,253 --> 00:21:32,214
Let's just save some time.

348
00:21:32,674 --> 00:21:34,195
Easy to do low hanging fruit, grab it.

349
00:21:35,436 --> 00:21:36,857
If we are not getting a lot of data,

350
00:21:38,657 --> 00:21:40,377
on something that also happens to be high scope.

351
00:21:40,517 --> 00:21:41,478
I'm going to archive it.

352
00:21:41,498 --> 00:21:42,678
You will also not hear about it.

353
00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:44,339
I'm just going to pretend it doesn't exist.

354
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,680
And then these other two categories

355
00:21:47,141 --> 00:21:49,342
are going to result in meetings, conversations,

356
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:50,322
decision-making.

357
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:51,843
We're going to talk through all of them.

358
00:21:52,143 --> 00:21:55,224
And this is what you can expect going forward the next week.

359
00:21:55,484 --> 00:21:56,645
And that was a great week.

360
00:21:56,705 --> 00:21:59,146
People knew what to expect and it lowered stress levels

361
00:22:00,647 --> 00:22:02,007
about all this data that was coming.

362
00:22:02,027 --> 00:22:04,048
They didn't know what it was going to result in.

363
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:11,761
My next piece of advice is to again, be problem focused and not solution focused.

364
00:22:12,681 --> 00:22:16,302
And when you're giving feedback, trying to focus on the problems you're trying to

365
00:22:16,362 --> 00:22:22,804
solve, you may describe what success looks like and you could, you could request

366
00:22:22,824 --> 00:22:26,585
the implementation of a very specific solution if you feel super strongly about

367
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:31,567
it, but I would, I would lean on the side of giving solutions as examples of

368
00:22:31,647 --> 00:22:35,228
something that might work and telling the team, you may take it if you want, it's

369
00:22:35,248 --> 00:22:35,648
there, but.

370
00:22:36,582 --> 00:22:37,703
don't feel pressure to do it.

371
00:22:38,825 --> 00:22:40,226
Here's an example.

372
00:22:41,768 --> 00:22:45,111
Let's say that we're making an I expect you to die level,

373
00:22:45,171 --> 00:22:46,293
and there's a rope in the level.

374
00:22:46,313 --> 00:22:48,094
And there's also a knife in the level.

375
00:22:48,695 --> 00:22:51,198
And the rope is there because we want the player to pull the rope

376
00:22:51,939 --> 00:22:56,483
and raise some sort of device by pulling the rope.

377
00:22:58,216 --> 00:23:01,277
However, what we're finding is that players find the knife and they go,

378
00:23:01,337 --> 00:23:02,597
rope can cut knife.

379
00:23:02,697 --> 00:23:03,837
I'm going to cut that rope.

380
00:23:04,337 --> 00:23:05,197
And that's just not working.

381
00:23:05,878 --> 00:23:06,558
It's not supported.

382
00:23:06,638 --> 00:23:08,658
We don't let people cut that rope with our knife.

383
00:23:09,838 --> 00:23:12,919
So I could go to the team and I could say, here's what we're noticing.

384
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:14,379
Playtesters are grabbing the knife.

385
00:23:14,539 --> 00:23:15,540
They're trying to cut the rope.

386
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,500
Let's just make the rope a chain, call it a day, ship that game.

387
00:23:20,881 --> 00:23:22,001
Uh, or.

388
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:24,642
I could say.

389
00:23:28,082 --> 00:23:28,722
Here's what we're gonna do.

390
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:31,363
Let's walk in the player's shoes for a second.

391
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:34,865
I am the player, I'm playing the game.

392
00:23:34,885 --> 00:23:40,568
I open the drawer, I find a knife, I pick up a knife.

393
00:23:41,889 --> 00:23:44,090
What do we expect the player to do once they pick up a knife?

394
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:46,331
Well, generally the player will find a new tool

395
00:23:47,091 --> 00:23:48,112
and they will look around the level

396
00:23:48,172 --> 00:23:50,233
and they will say, where can I use this new tool?

397
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:52,634
And what they're doing is they're looking left,

398
00:23:52,934 --> 00:23:54,895
they're looking right, they're seeing a rope

399
00:23:55,235 --> 00:23:56,496
and because they already had the knife,

400
00:23:56,536 --> 00:23:57,076
they're seeing a hat.

401
00:23:58,376 --> 00:24:01,418
there's a keyhole for my key, I'm gonna try to cut that.

402
00:24:01,878 --> 00:24:04,740
So we need to intercept them at that moment

403
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,101
and prevent that realization from happening.

404
00:24:08,081 --> 00:24:08,982
I don't care how you do it.

405
00:24:10,062 --> 00:24:12,204
We just need to prevent that realization from happening.

406
00:24:13,064 --> 00:24:14,385
So what does success look like?

407
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:17,526
The player never makes a connection, knife plus rope.

408
00:24:18,407 --> 00:24:19,868
How will you address that?

409
00:24:19,888 --> 00:24:22,069
I don't care, up to you.

410
00:24:22,589 --> 00:24:22,869
However,

411
00:24:23,711 --> 00:24:25,653
However, here's a possible solution.

412
00:24:25,713 --> 00:24:28,056
You could consider making that rope a chain.

413
00:24:29,117 --> 00:24:29,598
See what happens.

414
00:24:30,138 --> 00:24:30,819
That might solve it.

415
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,621
If you don't want to take it, don't take it.

416
00:24:32,862 --> 00:24:33,422
That's fine.

417
00:24:33,923 --> 00:24:35,284
Maybe the team comes back and says,

418
00:24:35,505 --> 00:24:36,245
you know what we're going to do?

419
00:24:36,846 --> 00:24:38,588
We're going to let the player cut the rope.

420
00:24:38,828 --> 00:24:39,269
And I'd be like.

421
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:41,441
That's awesome.

422
00:24:41,561 --> 00:24:42,161
Let's do that.

423
00:24:42,662 --> 00:24:44,163
Or they might say, we're going to get rid of the knife.

424
00:24:44,303 --> 00:24:45,684
And I'll say, even better.

425
00:24:45,704 --> 00:24:47,745
Fewer, fewer stuff to support.

426
00:24:47,826 --> 00:24:48,486
That's great.

427
00:24:48,826 --> 00:24:49,046
Right?

428
00:24:50,127 --> 00:24:53,850
So, so the tool that I like to use to surface these problems

429
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:56,332
is this walking in the player's shoes.

430
00:24:56,512 --> 00:24:58,934
So taking the team on a journey and.

431
00:25:00,322 --> 00:25:03,925
asking it every step of the way, you know, what is the player thinking? What does the player want

432
00:25:03,985 --> 00:25:09,529
to do? What might they do next with the knowledge they have approved? And what I've noticed is that

433
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:16,174
by running reviews that way, developers start also thinking that way when they're making the game.

434
00:25:16,374 --> 00:25:23,659
And so we start having fewer and fewer issues like this one. The key to all of this

435
00:25:24,547 --> 00:25:29,291
I think that the one takeaway that encapsulates this whole slide is this last one.

436
00:25:29,892 --> 00:25:31,573
There are many paths to victory.

437
00:25:31,754 --> 00:25:37,699
This is the true Zen moment for me as a design director, is when I can truly sit down and

438
00:25:37,719 --> 00:25:38,280
believe this.

439
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,423
What do I mean by many paths to victory?

440
00:25:42,024 --> 00:25:42,504
What I mean is...

441
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:47,984
My job as a design director is to make a great game,

442
00:25:48,124 --> 00:25:52,467
is to find, to find in the universe of possible great games

443
00:25:52,507 --> 00:25:55,229
that we could make, there are infinite great games,

444
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,911
I just need to find one of them.

445
00:25:58,812 --> 00:25:59,252
So what do I do?

446
00:25:59,473 --> 00:26:04,476
I tell my team, team, this is what a great game looks like.

447
00:26:04,737 --> 00:26:06,378
We're trying to find a game

448
00:26:07,439 --> 00:26:10,641
that is defined by these parameters.

449
00:26:11,533 --> 00:26:14,274
These are the boundaries that we cannot escape.

450
00:26:14,314 --> 00:26:17,475
These are some non-negotiables you cannot cross.

451
00:26:19,176 --> 00:26:22,217
And then it's up to you to take me to that great game

452
00:26:22,237 --> 00:26:23,897
however you want.

453
00:26:24,137 --> 00:26:26,378
If you can truly, truly believe that and let

454
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,739
your team take you there, you are going

455
00:26:28,779 --> 00:26:31,700
to be so delightfully surprised.

456
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:36,682
So my takeaway here is there are many paths to victory

457
00:26:36,982 --> 00:26:38,063
that you cannot see.

458
00:26:39,093 --> 00:26:42,274
And if you empower your team to take you to victory,

459
00:26:42,494 --> 00:26:45,715
if you define the boundaries, if you describe victory,

460
00:26:46,555 --> 00:26:48,816
and then you just guide them in that process,

461
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:50,476
then they're going to take you there

462
00:26:50,596 --> 00:26:51,936
and everyone's going to be happy.

463
00:26:52,737 --> 00:26:54,697
Maybe it's too wishful thinking,

464
00:26:54,777 --> 00:26:59,078
but this is the holy grail for me of game development.

465
00:27:00,439 --> 00:27:01,679
We're all trailblazing together.

466
00:27:03,187 --> 00:27:03,547
All right.

467
00:27:05,028 --> 00:27:08,791
The next problem we had to solve was that even though I

468
00:27:08,891 --> 00:27:14,355
preach problem solving, I have a solution-oriented brain.

469
00:27:15,615 --> 00:27:17,557
I'm just firing on all cylinders all the time.

470
00:27:17,597 --> 00:27:19,298
Solutions, solutions, solutions, solutions.

471
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:22,220
So I need a way to capture those solutions.

472
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:25,422
When they come to me, just put them somewhere

473
00:27:25,442 --> 00:27:26,683
so they can stop bothering me.

474
00:27:27,983 --> 00:27:30,585
So living agenda documents.

475
00:27:32,259 --> 00:27:33,900
Maybe, I don't know, maybe everyone uses these.

476
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:34,340
I don't know.

477
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,201
We came up with them.

478
00:27:35,241 --> 00:27:37,522
I feel like we would never use these before.

479
00:27:38,083 --> 00:27:43,886
Maybe we're just like in ancient times of game development here, but they're just documents

480
00:27:43,906 --> 00:27:48,029
where anyone can drop anything at any time to be discussed at the next meeting.

481
00:27:48,449 --> 00:27:50,851
So they look like this.

482
00:27:51,791 --> 00:27:52,912
And we have.

483
00:27:53,352 --> 00:27:56,673
a ton of recurring meetings in our team, right?

484
00:27:56,773 --> 00:27:59,354
We have one-on-ones every couple of weeks.

485
00:27:59,414 --> 00:28:01,115
We have design team meetings.

486
00:28:01,135 --> 00:28:03,215
We have director meetings every day.

487
00:28:04,136 --> 00:28:07,657
And the idea is that if you have a thought

488
00:28:07,777 --> 00:28:10,798
that is relevant to a specific person or a specific meeting,

489
00:28:11,238 --> 00:28:13,459
you can have that thought, capture that thought,

490
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:17,360
find the agenda, put it in the agenda, and forget about it.

491
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:20,101
If I don't do this, I go insane

492
00:28:20,261 --> 00:28:21,762
because my brain will not stop.

493
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,843
This is a different format for the same type of document.

494
00:28:27,303 --> 00:28:29,505
This is what we use for director meetings.

495
00:28:30,326 --> 00:28:31,527
And it's a little more formal.

496
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:32,567
It's sortable.

497
00:28:32,667 --> 00:28:35,189
So you can add items with a priority.

498
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:37,591
And then every day when directors meet,

499
00:28:38,252 --> 00:28:41,454
we sort by priority, sort by date, and just boom, boom, boom,

500
00:28:41,474 --> 00:28:44,076
boom, boom, start talking through these topics one by one,

501
00:28:44,637 --> 00:28:45,778
put the outcome on the notes.

502
00:28:45,818 --> 00:28:47,359
So if anyone missed it that day, they

503
00:28:47,379 --> 00:28:49,180
can come back and see what they missed,

504
00:28:49,801 --> 00:28:51,042
and then tag it as discussed.

505
00:28:52,007 --> 00:28:56,410
rinse and repeat. So we're adding stuff to this document daily and talking about it daily.

506
00:28:59,413 --> 00:29:03,517
The next piece of feedback we got, our next problem we wanted to solve,

507
00:29:04,878 --> 00:29:12,965
was that we had a horrible, horrible feedback process. It was the worst. Let's talk about why

508
00:29:12,985 --> 00:29:19,050
it was the worst. This is like painful to think about even. So we had stakeholders, I'm talking

509
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:19,510
about BPs.

510
00:29:20,978 --> 00:29:26,622
like C-level executives, like the people who will eventually sign the game and say, yes,

511
00:29:26,702 --> 00:29:32,565
this is shippable. Their feedback was coming too late in a cadence that was unpredictable

512
00:29:33,066 --> 00:29:37,649
and in a format that was hard for us to parse. That was not their fault, actually.

513
00:29:37,669 --> 00:29:40,050
It was mostly our fault. And then...

514
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:44,834
they weren't getting follow-up on what they wanted follow-up on because they didn't really

515
00:29:44,854 --> 00:29:49,898
know what they wanted follow-up on. And so we had some really, really rough meetings where,

516
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:54,963
where, you know, stakeholders would come to us and say, Hey, I didn't know this was the plan.

517
00:29:55,003 --> 00:29:58,927
I'm not on board with this plan. And it was just way too late for us to do much about it. And,

518
00:29:59,427 --> 00:30:02,770
and that just felt horrible. So we had to do something about that.

519
00:30:03,739 --> 00:30:08,481
And then we also had no avenue for the team to give feedback or people to give feedback, you know,

520
00:30:08,941 --> 00:30:13,823
as it came up whenever they wanted. And all of this was making people stressed out. Everyone

521
00:30:13,843 --> 00:30:18,045
was stressed. It was, we were stressed because feedback was coming late. Feedback givers were

522
00:30:18,085 --> 00:30:22,506
stressed because they were like, what kind of game are these guys making? It was, it was just not a,

523
00:30:22,606 --> 00:30:30,029
not a great situation. So, so the first thing we decided to do was to say, we're going to choose

524
00:30:30,129 --> 00:30:32,510
one person, one lucky, lucky person.

525
00:30:34,128 --> 00:30:38,072
and we're going to make them the owner of the feedback.

526
00:30:38,192 --> 00:30:40,995
This person will be in charge of solving

527
00:30:41,075 --> 00:30:43,037
and owning our feedback problem.

528
00:30:43,458 --> 00:30:45,400
And so we said, all right,

529
00:30:48,242 --> 00:30:50,605
if that sounds like you, raise your hand.

530
00:30:50,865 --> 00:30:52,467
And everyone took a step back and I said,

531
00:30:53,548 --> 00:30:55,390
me, give it to me, I want it.

532
00:30:56,867 --> 00:31:02,628
this problem, give it to me. So, so I became the owner of the feedback and my life became this

533
00:31:03,289 --> 00:31:09,391
for many, many months. All I was doing is saying, this person thinks this game is too boring. All

534
00:31:09,411 --> 00:31:13,712
right, put it in this box. This person thinks this thing's too yellow. Okay. Give it to the

535
00:31:13,752 --> 00:31:20,034
art director. This person saying that rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat. And I redesigned our

536
00:31:20,054 --> 00:31:25,616
feedback processes and split them into stakeholders and everybody else. So.

537
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:34,623
stakeholders. We made a special document for them, which I am super proud of. And we told them,

538
00:31:34,723 --> 00:31:39,325
please play the game every two weeks. And you're going to put all your feedback, everything you

539
00:31:39,365 --> 00:31:43,007
want, please, everything you want. As long as you're playing every two weeks, just put it all

540
00:31:43,027 --> 00:31:48,410
in this spreadsheet. Just tell us your build number, tell us who you are, whatever you're

541
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:53,473
playing and write your feedback. Just, just drop it in there, drop it all, drop it all.

542
00:31:54,493 --> 00:31:55,674
And I just ask one thing of you.

543
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:59,212
You're going to go to this high priority column, the one with the little yellow star.

544
00:32:00,273 --> 00:32:05,056
And if you want follow-up, you're going to say, yes, please give me follow-up.

545
00:32:05,536 --> 00:32:07,498
And I promise we will close the loop.

546
00:32:08,738 --> 00:32:13,542
The other side of that coin is if you don't want follow-up, you need to be okay.

547
00:32:14,382 --> 00:32:16,604
Never ever hearing about this ever again.

548
00:32:17,024 --> 00:32:22,307
So for example, you can say, hmm, I don't like the position of this dial on this

549
00:32:22,347 --> 00:32:24,569
machine, I think it's not going to work out.

550
00:32:25,918 --> 00:32:26,619
Do I need follow-up?

551
00:32:26,939 --> 00:32:27,479
No, that's fine.

552
00:32:27,499 --> 00:32:28,740
You guys figure out what to do about it.

553
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,420
And you truly need to be okay

554
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,981
knowing you're not gonna get follow-up.

555
00:32:33,101 --> 00:32:35,082
And this worked wonders for us

556
00:32:35,102 --> 00:32:37,263
because all of a sudden we had a clear cadence.

557
00:32:37,303 --> 00:32:38,643
We had a place to collect the feedback

558
00:32:39,544 --> 00:32:41,444
and we had assurance that someone

559
00:32:41,605 --> 00:32:43,945
was reading this feedback all the time.

560
00:32:45,606 --> 00:32:48,547
Very similar, we created a Trello board

561
00:32:49,207 --> 00:32:51,428
for the whole team to drop feedback in.

562
00:32:51,528 --> 00:32:54,530
So it looks something like this.

563
00:32:55,685 --> 00:33:03,032
And the deal with this Trello board is that any person in the team, anyone at any time,

564
00:33:03,252 --> 00:33:07,636
whenever they want, three in the morning, they woke up and they said, I have the best idea in

565
00:33:07,676 --> 00:33:15,123
the world. They can drop it in the Trello again, trying to get people's brains, clear people's

566
00:33:15,183 --> 00:33:20,408
brains. When they have ideas, they have a place for those ideas to live. And my, my.

567
00:33:22,095 --> 00:33:27,619
promise to you if you're part of this team is that I will read every single card that

568
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:29,540
goes in this Trello board.

569
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,882
So if you're not familiar with Trello boards, you know, there's these columns, you can make

570
00:33:33,962 --> 00:33:36,724
cards in the columns, and then you can move the cards around the different columns.

571
00:33:37,044 --> 00:33:42,147
So the first two columns are for anyone to put feedback whenever they want.

572
00:33:42,388 --> 00:33:46,830
There's one column for very important feedback, and one column for everything else.

573
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:50,412
Then a couple of times a week, I will go through the board

574
00:33:50,572 --> 00:33:52,714
and I would grab everything in that column.

575
00:33:53,555 --> 00:33:56,537
And again, put it in the little box.

576
00:33:56,878 --> 00:33:58,199
I'm going to go and I'm going to think,

577
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,402
what does this feedback want to be?

578
00:34:01,742 --> 00:34:03,304
So let's look at this one right here.

579
00:34:03,344 --> 00:34:05,726
There are not enough things to eat in the elevator level.

580
00:34:05,926 --> 00:34:07,267
We should add more bananas.

581
00:34:08,508 --> 00:34:09,269
Fascinating.

582
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:10,590
What do I want to do about this?

583
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:14,574
So let's say I say, yeah, now this person is absolutely

584
00:34:14,614 --> 00:34:15,575
right, more bananas.

585
00:34:16,355 --> 00:34:22,639
So I grab it and I put it into the turn me into a task column and a producer later goes

586
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:24,460
there and turns it into a task.

587
00:34:26,101 --> 00:34:32,645
Or let's say I think, you know, I am, I need to talk to the level, the level of people

588
00:34:32,705 --> 00:34:33,185
about this.

589
00:34:33,285 --> 00:34:34,846
There might be something to this, but I'm not sure.

590
00:34:35,026 --> 00:34:35,967
I'm not sure what to do here.

591
00:34:35,987 --> 00:34:38,388
I'm going to put in a design review and we'll talk about it later.

592
00:34:42,774 --> 00:34:45,295
I might say, I have no idea what to do with this.

593
00:34:45,335 --> 00:34:46,315
This is not my problem.

594
00:34:46,856 --> 00:34:47,416
Let's say this.

595
00:34:47,876 --> 00:34:50,578
Pretend this card says bananas are too yellow.

596
00:34:50,598 --> 00:34:51,958
I think bananas should be green.

597
00:34:51,978 --> 00:34:56,421
I would grab that, and I would put it in the art review column

598
00:34:56,441 --> 00:34:58,162
and say, art director, this is your problem.

599
00:34:59,242 --> 00:34:59,642
Bye bye.

600
00:34:59,662 --> 00:35:00,603
Do whatever you want with this.

601
00:35:01,784 --> 00:35:04,425
The magic of this board is that it empowers anyone

602
00:35:04,445 --> 00:35:05,926
to give feedback at any time.

603
00:35:06,606 --> 00:35:09,227
And by knowing that I will look at it, they feel heard,

604
00:35:09,488 --> 00:35:11,969
and they feel like they have a way to impact the game.

605
00:35:12,917 --> 00:35:14,977
The best way is they're just doing my job for me.

606
00:35:15,798 --> 00:35:18,098
They're just, they're just telling me what do we need to fix?

607
00:35:18,158 --> 00:35:19,499
So the tasks just make themselves.

608
00:35:19,539 --> 00:35:19,979
That's great.

609
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:24,601
So from, from engaging with feedback for so long, I learned two big things.

610
00:35:25,701 --> 00:35:30,983
The first thing may not surprise you is about problems and solutions is that

611
00:35:31,103 --> 00:35:35,205
people love to give feedback in solution form, so you might get feedback that

612
00:35:35,285 --> 00:35:39,366
says something like move the key.

613
00:35:40,503 --> 00:35:42,664
from the drawer to under the seat.

614
00:35:42,764 --> 00:35:44,384
That's a way better place for the key.

615
00:35:45,745 --> 00:35:47,265
And you might be tempted to look at that and say,

616
00:35:48,325 --> 00:35:50,346
nah, that's dumb and throw it away, right?

617
00:35:51,226 --> 00:35:54,087
What I encourage you to do is ask yourself,

618
00:35:55,228 --> 00:35:57,328
what problem is this person trying to solve

619
00:35:57,449 --> 00:35:58,129
with this solution?

620
00:35:58,149 --> 00:35:59,709
They're giving me a solution, which I don't like.

621
00:35:59,749 --> 00:36:02,190
I'm not gonna do this, but I do want to know,

622
00:36:03,591 --> 00:36:05,271
why do they want to move the key?

623
00:36:05,611 --> 00:36:06,592
So are they telling me that the key

624
00:36:06,612 --> 00:36:07,832
is too easy to find right now?

625
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:11,031
Are they telling me that the key is too hard to find right now?

626
00:36:11,912 --> 00:36:13,413
Are they telling me there's too many things in the drawer?

627
00:36:14,193 --> 00:36:16,315
Or that we should put something under the chair

628
00:36:16,355 --> 00:36:18,496
because it's a great hiding place?

629
00:36:19,237 --> 00:36:20,958
So if possible, I'll go talk to that person

630
00:36:21,118 --> 00:36:22,339
and I dig a little deeper.

631
00:36:23,499 --> 00:36:29,383
And if not possible, then I try to as much as I can reverse

632
00:36:29,443 --> 00:36:31,605
engineer that feedback to see where it might be coming from.

633
00:36:31,865 --> 00:36:33,126
So think solutions.

634
00:36:33,206 --> 00:36:34,186
Sorry, don't think solutions.

635
00:36:34,446 --> 00:36:35,087
Think problems.

636
00:36:36,429 --> 00:36:42,854
The other piece of feedback is about digging deeper instead of pulling back.

637
00:36:44,415 --> 00:36:48,398
We all receive feedback in our lives, in our careers, at home, whenever.

638
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:55,023
We all receive feedback or find ourselves in situations that make us uncomfortable and

639
00:36:55,203 --> 00:37:01,788
not unsafe, uncomfortable, and tend to pull back and say, I don't want to engage with

640
00:37:01,808 --> 00:37:03,149
that because it makes me uncomfortable.

641
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:07,364
I will say that I have learned the most about myself

642
00:37:08,185 --> 00:37:09,966
by not pulling back in those situations,

643
00:37:10,006 --> 00:37:14,890
but instead asking, why does this make me uncomfortable?

644
00:37:16,652 --> 00:37:18,533
And if I can be truly honest with myself

645
00:37:18,613 --> 00:37:19,574
and answer that question,

646
00:37:19,674 --> 00:37:22,516
then I find that it leads to growth every single time.

647
00:37:23,237 --> 00:37:27,000
One example here is we tend to get,

648
00:37:28,041 --> 00:37:29,442
obviously, a lot of puzzle feedback

649
00:37:29,462 --> 00:37:31,724
because our game has many, many puzzles.

650
00:37:33,047 --> 00:37:36,128
And I am often tempted to say,

651
00:37:36,148 --> 00:37:38,488
wow, this person just doesn't understand puzzles

652
00:37:38,648 --> 00:37:39,929
or they don't understand this puzzle.

653
00:37:40,489 --> 00:37:41,229
This puzzle is great.

654
00:37:41,409 --> 00:37:42,809
This person doesn't know what they're talking about.

655
00:37:43,209 --> 00:37:45,110
And every time I find myself thinking that,

656
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:47,210
I say, stop.

657
00:37:50,551 --> 00:37:52,611
Pretend they do know what they're talking about.

658
00:37:52,951 --> 00:37:54,132
Or what is it about this puzzle

659
00:37:54,172 --> 00:37:56,852
that is making me have this reaction, right?

660
00:37:57,632 --> 00:38:00,013
And more often than not, I find that it's maybe

661
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,241
Maybe they're telling me to simplify the puzzle

662
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,302
and I'm reticent because I want the puzzle to be hard

663
00:38:05,342 --> 00:38:06,622
and maybe it doesn't need to be hard.

664
00:38:07,343 --> 00:38:08,523
Or maybe they're really telling me

665
00:38:08,563 --> 00:38:10,244
that it's not a good fit for the game

666
00:38:10,284 --> 00:38:11,685
and it's also that I'm fond of,

667
00:38:11,745 --> 00:38:13,045
but if I think about it really hard,

668
00:38:13,065 --> 00:38:14,326
I'm like, you know, maybe actually,

669
00:38:14,346 --> 00:38:15,827
maybe it's not a great fit for the game.

670
00:38:16,287 --> 00:38:18,728
Or maybe it is, but just having that conversation with myself

671
00:38:20,669 --> 00:38:21,970
it always leads to a lot of value.

672
00:38:25,231 --> 00:38:26,032
One more problem here.

673
00:38:28,147 --> 00:38:29,627
We were insane when we made this schedule.

674
00:38:29,827 --> 00:38:30,567
This makes no sense.

675
00:38:31,488 --> 00:38:31,988
Here's what I mean.

676
00:38:32,468 --> 00:38:32,828
We're here.

677
00:38:32,848 --> 00:38:36,509
This is alphas for the second set of levels.

678
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:40,411
And we're sitting there being like, we don't even

679
00:38:40,471 --> 00:38:41,471
know how this game ends.

680
00:38:42,711 --> 00:38:44,252
And we're supposed to make two full levels.

681
00:38:45,552 --> 00:38:47,293
Four full levels, because we already have two.

682
00:38:48,377 --> 00:38:49,817
we're already gonna have to go back to those two

683
00:38:49,837 --> 00:38:51,098
because we already changed a bunch of stuff

684
00:38:51,118 --> 00:38:54,459
that just, we're gonna have to change again.

685
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:58,561
So like, this is just unsustainable.

686
00:38:58,601 --> 00:38:59,081
What are we gonna do?

687
00:38:59,201 --> 00:39:00,542
Make these levels and finish them

688
00:39:00,582 --> 00:39:05,084
and then like, call a voice actor and retrofit the voice.

689
00:39:05,104 --> 00:39:08,745
This is, we just messed up with the schedule.

690
00:39:08,765 --> 00:39:09,906
Let's go back to the drawing board.

691
00:39:11,446 --> 00:39:12,567
And let's pause here.

692
00:39:13,502 --> 00:39:16,764
And instead of going into level two and five betas,

693
00:39:17,685 --> 00:39:19,025
let's go to the other two levels.

694
00:39:19,886 --> 00:39:21,166
And let's just get everything to alpha.

695
00:39:22,107 --> 00:39:23,928
And then we can just play the whole game

696
00:39:24,969 --> 00:39:27,810
and just understand what we're making truly.

697
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:29,211
Like, let's make a blob

698
00:39:29,891 --> 00:39:31,872
and then shape it into something beautiful

699
00:39:31,912 --> 00:39:34,214
instead of trying to make like a beautiful arm

700
00:39:34,254 --> 00:39:36,155
and then be like, oh, no, let's make a beautiful head

701
00:39:36,215 --> 00:39:37,936
and be like, oh, actually we're making a dog.

702
00:39:38,076 --> 00:39:38,776
Oh, that kind of sucks.

703
00:39:38,836 --> 00:39:40,297
I guess this dog has an arm now.

704
00:39:40,317 --> 00:39:40,357
So.

705
00:39:42,648 --> 00:39:45,629
We did that and we reworked our whole schedule

706
00:39:46,389 --> 00:39:48,630
and decided to make all the alphas first.

707
00:39:49,471 --> 00:39:52,092
This is like, you know, a one minute part of this talk.

708
00:39:52,112 --> 00:39:55,753
This was like the biggest decision of this whole game.

709
00:39:57,714 --> 00:40:01,515
And then the last one is that beta time is short.

710
00:40:01,595 --> 00:40:02,816
We don't have that much time for beta.

711
00:40:03,016 --> 00:40:04,976
And as you might remember, we don't have buffer anymore.

712
00:40:04,996 --> 00:40:07,217
So we're starting to like sweat and be like,

713
00:40:07,898 --> 00:40:09,798
how are we actually going to finish these levels?

714
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:17,541
And that was another great problem for me to jump on because my dirty, dirty secret is that...

715
00:40:19,045 --> 00:40:20,026
I love solutions.

716
00:40:22,107 --> 00:40:24,209
I have to work really hard to think in problems.

717
00:40:24,729 --> 00:40:28,172
Being a design director means you're just exposing the problems.

718
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:31,754
You're explaining why things are problems and empowering your people to solve those

719
00:40:31,814 --> 00:40:32,315
problems.

720
00:40:32,935 --> 00:40:38,199
But when you get to sink your teeth in a problem, it's like, yes, I want it.

721
00:40:38,799 --> 00:40:40,621
I will destroy this problem.

722
00:40:41,201 --> 00:40:43,543
So I took these levels, the levels that were...

723
00:40:44,364 --> 00:40:48,251
once they hit alpha I would take them be like I'll be right back and I would take them to

724
00:40:48,271 --> 00:40:52,439
what I call my design cave. I would commune with them in silence and be like

725
00:40:53,494 --> 00:40:54,915
you need to be fixed level.

726
00:40:55,055 --> 00:40:56,316
Let's understand why.

727
00:40:56,336 --> 00:40:58,477
I would come out of the my design cave,

728
00:40:58,537 --> 00:40:59,898
which is not a literal place.

729
00:41:00,419 --> 00:41:03,901
And I would tell the team, I bring you problems.

730
00:41:04,622 --> 00:41:05,902
I think these are the problems.

731
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:09,505
And actually I thought about solutions, let's talk.

732
00:41:09,705 --> 00:41:11,786
And so we would have a conversation about these solutions.

733
00:41:11,826 --> 00:41:15,769
I would bring some solutions as starting points.

734
00:41:15,809 --> 00:41:18,811
And then we would come out of that with a lot of tasks.

735
00:41:19,191 --> 00:41:19,331
And...

736
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:22,382
This was my favorite part of the project.

737
00:41:22,442 --> 00:41:23,022
I will admit it.

738
00:41:23,082 --> 00:41:27,563
Maybe my team is hearing me say this for the first time, but, uh, being able to

739
00:41:27,643 --> 00:41:33,784
set up the team for betas with a clear list of tasks was just awesome.

740
00:41:34,024 --> 00:41:35,885
And you'll see why very shortly.

741
00:41:36,985 --> 00:41:41,226
So my takeaway from that process, so this is just a fancy way of

742
00:41:41,286 --> 00:41:43,406
saying play to your strengths.

743
00:41:43,806 --> 00:41:45,887
You know, you know, your team, you know, the people on your team,

744
00:41:45,907 --> 00:41:46,887
you know, how much time you have.

745
00:41:47,612 --> 00:41:50,614
you hopefully understand the problem really well.

746
00:41:50,634 --> 00:41:55,677
So, you know, design solutions that fit the people that you have.

747
00:41:56,457 --> 00:41:59,479
Set yourself up for success in a way that you may be able to,

748
00:42:00,379 --> 00:42:03,921
the way I, the way, like my measure for did I do this right is

749
00:42:05,622 --> 00:42:10,044
when we solve the problem, can we look at it and say, huh, how did we do that?

750
00:42:10,204 --> 00:42:12,606
We should not have been able to do that with the time we have.

751
00:42:13,206 --> 00:42:16,488
And if you feel like yes, and also no one crunched, then you can say.

752
00:42:18,517 --> 00:42:21,277
I have used my resources in the best possible way.

753
00:42:23,278 --> 00:42:23,538
All right.

754
00:42:23,798 --> 00:42:28,579
So in retrospect, these like past 30 minutes of this talk, which only

755
00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:32,120
represent a little bit of the schedule, where were we like had the

756
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:35,660
toughest process problems to solve?

757
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:39,481
I call it the feedback avalanche stage because we were just receiving,

758
00:42:39,521 --> 00:42:41,402
receiving, receiving, receiving, and like.

759
00:42:42,065 --> 00:42:49,429
you know, changing our processes to like shape what we were making as we were going and set up for the next stage.

760
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:53,491
That is, bring all the levels to beta.

761
00:42:53,892 --> 00:43:01,296
So, you know, we're emerging from alpha, so we have a game that is fully playable at alpha level.

762
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:08,560
We have a task in hand, which is to bring everything to fully playable state or technically shippable state.

763
00:43:12,642 --> 00:43:14,103
We have those documents, right?

764
00:43:14,223 --> 00:43:16,224
The documents that define our work super well.

765
00:43:17,224 --> 00:43:20,385
So I like, I wake up one day and I make this realization.

766
00:43:21,105 --> 00:43:21,406
Boom.

767
00:43:23,286 --> 00:43:25,987
Our team is just flying.

768
00:43:27,808 --> 00:43:31,029
Our team is just extremely proficient

769
00:43:31,569 --> 00:43:33,230
at making these levels right now.

770
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:38,232
Not only that, our team has a well-defined task list

771
00:43:38,312 --> 00:43:40,093
that will take us to success.

772
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:45,515
And I look at the directors and I go, we're about to be in trouble.

773
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:50,780
These, these developers are going to leave us in the dust.

774
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,423
We're not going to be able to unblock them fast enough.

775
00:43:54,083 --> 00:43:57,366
They're just working way, way too fast.

776
00:43:57,507 --> 00:43:58,668
They're getting too much done.

777
00:43:59,148 --> 00:44:02,491
Like we are, if we don't step up and find a way to support them, we're going

778
00:44:02,532 --> 00:44:03,873
to start just becoming inefficiency.

779
00:44:04,814 --> 00:44:04,894
And.

780
00:44:05,687 --> 00:44:08,889
So we come up with a solution, which is, I love the solution.

781
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:10,470
Uh, no more scrums.

782
00:44:10,651 --> 00:44:14,073
So no more daily meetings in the morning where we all get in a room and we have a

783
00:44:14,093 --> 00:44:16,935
virtual room and we say, I did these three things.

784
00:44:17,016 --> 00:44:18,957
And then I say, I did these other three things.

785
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:25,324
No, we're going to have scrums. We're going to have scrums in game. So I put my headset on in

786
00:44:25,364 --> 00:44:29,507
the morning. I wake up, right? I make my coffee. I have to drink it all. And if I don't drink it,

787
00:44:29,807 --> 00:44:34,751
whatever I don't drink, I put on the desk. It's 10 in the morning and maybe it's like 930. And

788
00:44:35,171 --> 00:44:42,577
I put on my headset and I share my screen and it's first inbox into the review channel. And everyone

789
00:44:42,637 --> 00:44:48,342
says what they did that's in game right now. Maybe someone didn't have any in-game work. That's fine.

790
00:44:49,371 --> 00:44:54,455
uh but people who did we talk about it we review it right there so whatever you did yesterday gets

791
00:44:54,515 --> 00:44:59,658
reviewed in the morning the next day you get action items based on that off you go you're

792
00:44:59,678 --> 00:45:06,983
unblocked next pod same thing next pod same thing if anything requires a larger conversation

793
00:45:07,865 --> 00:45:13,291
We tag it, we put it in that document, the VP, sorry, the director living agenda,

794
00:45:13,311 --> 00:45:15,854
the spreadsheet that we can prioritize, drop it there.

795
00:45:16,975 --> 00:45:18,337
And then it's 1130.

796
00:45:19,117 --> 00:45:19,978
I take off my headset.

797
00:45:20,922 --> 00:45:22,783
I'm like, the sun is out.

798
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:26,305
I look at my coffee and it's like, I still have like a half a mug of cold coffee.

799
00:45:26,325 --> 00:45:28,786
Cause like, I forgot I had it there cause I was in VR the whole time.

800
00:45:28,807 --> 00:45:33,690
And then we pull up that spreadsheet and we make some decisions, turn some

801
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:36,851
things into meetings, schedule some discussions with the developers for the

802
00:45:36,891 --> 00:45:39,473
afternoon, and then we just keep going.

803
00:45:39,593 --> 00:45:41,895
And the game just boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

804
00:45:41,915 --> 00:45:42,735
It's getting built.

805
00:45:42,755 --> 00:45:43,496
It's taking shape.

806
00:45:43,556 --> 00:45:46,617
It's like, we are just firing on all cylinders.

807
00:45:47,218 --> 00:45:49,019
So daily builds with daily reviews.

808
00:45:51,318 --> 00:45:58,050
take away from this is and moving that fast did take creative power away from the team.

809
00:45:59,233 --> 00:46:01,517
The majority of cases people were already like

810
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:05,882
they were valuing that speed over agency,

811
00:46:06,302 --> 00:46:07,383
over creative agency.

812
00:46:07,823 --> 00:46:08,884
But we did need to check.

813
00:46:08,964 --> 00:46:11,106
And in some cases we did have to pull back

814
00:46:11,646 --> 00:46:13,728
because the cost of moving fast

815
00:46:13,988 --> 00:46:15,349
is you have to make fast decisions.

816
00:46:15,889 --> 00:46:17,150
And if you wanna make fast decisions

817
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:18,831
that you're gonna be happy with as a director,

818
00:46:19,292 --> 00:46:22,154
you are very likely to start demanding solutions,

819
00:46:22,334 --> 00:46:24,175
saying, you know what, let's not make this a conversation.

820
00:46:24,376 --> 00:46:25,717
I know what this is gonna make me happy.

821
00:46:26,137 --> 00:46:28,719
Just turn the rope into a chain.

822
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:33,923
ship it, right? And those things start to add up and people start to feel like the game is sort of

823
00:46:34,323 --> 00:46:38,546
being taken away from them. So you have to do this carefully and you have to

824
00:46:38,927 --> 00:46:41,729
make sure the team has, you know, buy-in in this process.

825
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:49,434
Notable documents. Can anyone think, from all your experience, what was the document that you would

826
00:46:49,494 --> 00:46:57,080
say, the game is moving so fast, we're making everything so quickly, what's the document that

827
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:57,981
will serve you the best?

828
00:47:00,114 --> 00:47:00,775
There is none.

829
00:47:02,056 --> 00:47:04,778
No document exists that can hold velocity.

830
00:47:05,439 --> 00:47:08,021
It's maybe we're making like one-offs here and there,

831
00:47:08,081 --> 00:47:09,582
but it's just everything's going in the game.

832
00:47:09,922 --> 00:47:14,066
There's no document that's worth implementation time

833
00:47:14,106 --> 00:47:14,606
at this point.

834
00:47:16,548 --> 00:47:18,310
We get through this, we emerge on the other side.

835
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:19,871
We're like, all right, we did a thing.

836
00:47:19,911 --> 00:47:20,892
We have a game, I guess.

837
00:47:21,993 --> 00:47:24,835
If you play the whole thing, it's technically shippable.

838
00:47:27,483 --> 00:47:33,712
And we did end up going back to the first two levels and doing a little extra work there.

839
00:47:33,792 --> 00:47:36,435
And it feels like, you know, we got it done.

840
00:47:37,537 --> 00:47:39,840
And now we're going to make it shine.

841
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:42,122
So let's polish this piece.

842
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:50,044
The goal of Polish is, even though we could technically ship that game after beta,

843
00:47:50,104 --> 00:47:52,446
we're not going to. We wouldn't ship it.

844
00:47:53,027 --> 00:47:56,869
It's not at the quality bar that we want to hit at Shell Games.

845
00:47:57,850 --> 00:48:00,472
So we're going to make it consistent and we're going to make it shine.

846
00:48:00,912 --> 00:48:02,133
And how are we going to do that?

847
00:48:02,334 --> 00:48:05,876
Well, first, we're going to prioritize the Polish work.

848
00:48:06,817 --> 00:48:08,298
And this is a game of min-maxing.

849
00:48:08,518 --> 00:48:11,160
This is finding the things that are not.

850
00:48:12,653 --> 00:48:15,912
acceptable, I'm bringing them to acceptable. And then

851
00:48:17,101 --> 00:48:21,123
We had this top 10 moments document where we pulled playtesters,

852
00:48:21,143 --> 00:48:28,648
we pulled the whole team and we found what are the 10 moments that we think

853
00:48:28,888 --> 00:48:32,330
are going to be the most memorable? When you take off your headset, you finish the game,

854
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:37,694
you're going to be like, oh man, I really enjoyed that thing in the jet level where

855
00:48:38,254 --> 00:48:43,657
whatever happens, right? And that's where we're going to spend our polish money.

856
00:48:44,718 --> 00:48:47,981
we are going to again, min-max, min-max polish,

857
00:48:49,422 --> 00:48:51,684
bring things that are not acceptable up to acceptable,

858
00:48:52,344 --> 00:48:55,627
and then take the best and make it even better

859
00:48:55,867 --> 00:48:57,589
to create memorable moments.

860
00:48:59,711 --> 00:49:02,233
And then the other thing I wanted to solve was that like,

861
00:49:02,253 --> 00:49:04,014
I mean again, I...

862
00:49:06,082 --> 00:49:09,884
I use the metaphor of like, I wake up in the middle of the night saying, oh crap, we're

863
00:49:09,904 --> 00:49:10,324
in trouble.

864
00:49:10,384 --> 00:49:11,085
It's not a metaphor.

865
00:49:11,105 --> 00:49:11,865
It's like legit.

866
00:49:12,086 --> 00:49:13,246
Like what happens?

867
00:49:13,266 --> 00:49:14,127
That's just my brain.

868
00:49:14,147 --> 00:49:20,571
Uh, I, I just came into work when they convinced us, like we have changed so much.

869
00:49:20,771 --> 00:49:22,072
Remember we've been moving so fast.

870
00:49:22,432 --> 00:49:22,673
Right.

871
00:49:22,973 --> 00:49:24,794
So I'm like, we've changed so much.

872
00:49:25,554 --> 00:49:27,756
We've changed so much in the past two months.

873
00:49:28,728 --> 00:49:33,990
that surely we messed up somewhere. Surely there's something we didn't have time to play test. So

874
00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:40,092
I put together this list. Here's a template. This is like, this is more like a, you know,

875
00:49:40,212 --> 00:49:45,014
15 item list of like every change we made in this last three months that I feel like

876
00:49:46,475 --> 00:49:47,215
this could be risky.

877
00:49:48,226 --> 00:49:50,729
Then I would say, okay, how risky?

878
00:49:51,089 --> 00:49:53,391
High risky, medium risky, low risky.

879
00:49:53,632 --> 00:49:56,154
I'm trying to gauge risk there a little bit.

880
00:49:57,796 --> 00:50:00,319
And then we unleashed all of our playtester team.

881
00:50:01,542 --> 00:50:07,645
on it, right? We got a bunch of playtester videos and then we reviewed like everyone was in those

882
00:50:07,685 --> 00:50:13,428
videos trying to find answers to these specific questions and we were able to get confirmation.

883
00:50:13,628 --> 00:50:17,590
In some cases confirmation that actually we did mess up and in some other cases confirmation that

884
00:50:18,010 --> 00:50:24,674
in most cases that everything was okay. Now just for last minute peace of mind to make sure we

885
00:50:24,694 --> 00:50:28,596
weren't shipping something out there that like everyone's going to get stuck on some small thing

886
00:50:28,636 --> 00:50:28,916
we tweet.

887
00:50:32,482 --> 00:50:37,847
And then the last problem we had to solve was that we had what I call infinite clarity on how to improve the game.

888
00:50:38,728 --> 00:50:47,695
And we made the, you know, we had the realization that two more weeks, two more weeks would give us like...

889
00:50:48,654 --> 00:50:53,900
a month's worth of work. Not because we're going to work those many hours, but because

890
00:50:54,861 --> 00:51:01,548
our developers were just at this point, experts, right? We're all pizza chefs. Now we're all have,

891
00:51:01,588 --> 00:51:08,776
we're all open to our own restaurants of, uh, you know, farm to table, handcrafted.

892
00:51:10,337 --> 00:51:12,599
I don't know, specialty pizza.

893
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:14,921
And we're just boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,

894
00:51:15,141 --> 00:51:17,463
bumping out like delicious pizza left and right.

895
00:51:18,043 --> 00:51:19,705
And so we did get a two week extension

896
00:51:20,565 --> 00:51:22,507
and generated immense value.

897
00:51:22,627 --> 00:51:25,749
But I will tell you those two weeks in terms of exhaustion

898
00:51:25,850 --> 00:51:29,493
just felt like, I don't know,

899
00:51:29,533 --> 00:51:31,394
like at least a month worth of exhaustion,

900
00:51:31,514 --> 00:51:33,456
not because we were working those extra hours,

901
00:51:34,256 --> 00:51:36,138
but because we had to make the mind shift of,

902
00:51:36,518 --> 00:51:38,260
oh, we thought we were done, but we're not.

903
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:45,681
The game is essentially done at this time.

904
00:51:46,502 --> 00:51:48,363
This is what I call the make it great phase.

905
00:51:49,764 --> 00:51:54,288
And all that's left after that is porting the game and a little more QA.

906
00:51:56,810 --> 00:51:58,352
And I was mostly the one in charge of porting.

907
00:51:58,432 --> 00:52:03,376
I don't have a lot of lessons to impart on you on porting other than, you know,

908
00:52:03,796 --> 00:52:05,157
find someone who is, who is,

909
00:52:06,816 --> 00:52:11,980
super into UX and unleash them on all the different VR controllers because they're

910
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:20,586
all different beasts. And you will bang your head being like, how do I fit my control scheme

911
00:52:21,087 --> 00:52:32,295
to work with Vive and Oculus Quest and PlayStation VR in a game with so many inputs? It's complex.

912
00:52:33,416 --> 00:52:36,398
So find someone who enjoys that work and says, oh, complex but rewarding.

913
00:52:37,265 --> 00:52:38,406
That's the person you want on your team.

914
00:52:40,808 --> 00:52:41,208
Right.

915
00:52:41,248 --> 00:52:43,070
So wrapping it up, wrapping it up.

916
00:52:43,090 --> 00:52:44,010
That was a whirlwind.

917
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:44,511
All right.

918
00:52:45,311 --> 00:52:48,694
Um, on the bottom is the original plan and on the top is her actual schedule.

919
00:52:50,356 --> 00:52:54,039
Uh, you'll notice that the one on the top is slightly longer, not to scale.

920
00:52:54,919 --> 00:52:58,622
And that we had that readjustment where we did all the alphas

921
00:52:58,663 --> 00:53:00,324
first and then all the beta work.

922
00:53:02,489 --> 00:53:09,653
I did my best to condense all the document, notable documentation into one slide.

923
00:53:09,673 --> 00:53:10,554
So here it is for you.

924
00:53:11,894 --> 00:53:18,098
And I also did my best to gather all the design direction takeaways into a different slide

925
00:53:19,539 --> 00:53:24,842
and feel free to share or, you know, print these and put them on your office.

926
00:53:26,762 --> 00:53:31,464
And that's it. That's all I got. I did leave some room for questions there at the end,

927
00:53:31,484 --> 00:53:36,426
so if we have anyone lined up for questions, awesome. And like I said, you guys

928
00:53:39,127 --> 00:53:44,989
can access all these slides at the URL that's there, so feel free to peruse that

929
00:53:45,609 --> 00:53:49,050
at your own leisure. And I hope you enjoyed the talk.

930
00:54:05,917 --> 00:54:13,181
Hi, you mentioned getting your team to think about problems

931
00:54:13,241 --> 00:54:14,321
instead of solutions.

932
00:54:14,942 --> 00:54:16,562
Did you have any challenges in getting

933
00:54:16,603 --> 00:54:19,524
them to kind of think in that way and open up with you?

934
00:54:19,544 --> 00:54:22,385
I feel like sometimes it can be kind of intimidating

935
00:54:22,445 --> 00:54:24,786
to get a team to give you feedback in that way.

936
00:54:26,326 --> 00:54:27,247
Yeah, no, absolutely.

937
00:54:28,548 --> 00:54:30,389
Something that I would recommend is,

938
00:54:30,769 --> 00:54:33,652
I mean, I don't want to use the word like enemy,

939
00:54:33,672 --> 00:54:35,773
but I try to find a common enemy or a common,

940
00:54:36,054 --> 00:54:40,917
like it's not the team opening up to me about the problems,

941
00:54:40,937 --> 00:54:42,939
it's if we can align on the goal.

942
00:54:46,081 --> 00:54:49,244
Something that was extremely useful for me were the pillars.

943
00:54:49,344 --> 00:54:52,747
So, back in at the start, I shared the three pillars.

944
00:54:53,731 --> 00:54:54,471
from the first game.

945
00:54:54,491 --> 00:54:57,053
One of those pillars is lead them to cleverness.

946
00:54:57,614 --> 00:55:02,197
And that is a pillar that over and over and over

947
00:55:02,237 --> 00:55:04,658
we're using to uncover those problems.

948
00:55:04,758 --> 00:55:07,400
So a big part of the review when we're doing reviews

949
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:11,183
was a level reviews, I'll go on the headset

950
00:55:11,243 --> 00:55:12,704
and I would pretend to be a player and I would say,

951
00:55:12,724 --> 00:55:15,005
all right, I'm going to let this level

952
00:55:15,065 --> 00:55:16,446
lead me to cleverness, right?

953
00:55:16,927 --> 00:55:18,808
And I would speak out loud from the player's voice.

954
00:55:19,809 --> 00:55:26,298
and you know not being facetious or anything just like truly trying to uncover where might a player

955
00:55:26,318 --> 00:55:32,527
get tripped up and the questions I like to ask there are as a player what do I know right now

956
00:55:32,587 --> 00:55:33,989
and what am I going to do with that knowledge?

957
00:55:34,990 --> 00:55:39,775
and do I feel like I'm being led to cleverness? And if we feel like that's not really working,

958
00:55:39,795 --> 00:55:43,699
then I call it out. I say, right, that's a problem we need to solve. Let's keep going.

959
00:55:43,719 --> 00:55:49,866
Let's keep reviewing. So we collect problems to solve that way. And then we can talk about

960
00:55:50,587 --> 00:55:53,590
what might lead to some

961
00:55:57,437 --> 00:55:58,538
some solutions that are OK.

962
00:55:58,718 --> 00:56:02,482
So at that point is when I would start

963
00:56:03,622 --> 00:56:10,468
defining what is a solution that is OK, so defining success.

964
00:56:11,009 --> 00:56:14,712
So again, back to that rope example, success for me

965
00:56:14,772 --> 00:56:19,716
could be that I never noticed that I

966
00:56:20,016 --> 00:56:21,217
make the realization that I could

967
00:56:21,438 --> 00:56:22,498
cut the rope with a knife.

968
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:26,701
But the true success in our game, again, back to that pillar,

969
00:56:27,162 --> 00:56:33,766
tends to be that I have some moment of clever realization.

970
00:56:34,727 --> 00:56:38,189
And if I can build toward that clever realization,

971
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:41,411
then I'm happy as a design director.

972
00:56:43,172 --> 00:56:45,694
So I tend to frame the solution that we're looking for

973
00:56:46,254 --> 00:56:49,496
into a solution that, again, taking it back to the pillars,

974
00:56:49,877 --> 00:56:52,559
satisfy the game pillars that we have.

975
00:56:53,705 --> 00:56:55,253
that we have defined.

976
00:56:58,597 --> 00:57:03,121
I see from what I hear there's no one in line at the moment for questions.

977
00:57:03,161 --> 00:57:04,362
I'm going to ask myself a question.

978
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:05,123
Oh, yeah, yeah, go ahead.

979
00:57:05,283 --> 00:57:05,463
Yes.

980
00:57:05,783 --> 00:57:17,433
So the team feedback tracker, when you have some feedback from the team and you decide to not move forward with the feedback, what do you do with the ticket?

981
00:57:17,453 --> 00:57:24,940
Do you just delete it or do you come back to the team member and tell them what decision was taken or how do you handle it?

982
00:57:25,505 --> 00:57:32,447
Yeah, most often what I do is, so we're talking, we're in Trello, so people add their own name to the card, so I know who it's coming from.

983
00:57:33,527 --> 00:57:36,128
And Trello by default subscribes you to that card.

984
00:57:36,729 --> 00:57:41,050
So I write in the comments of the card what I'm going to do about it, right?

985
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:46,092
So I might say, we're not going to do anything about this because, you know, reasons.

986
00:57:47,692 --> 00:57:48,733
And then I archive it.

987
00:57:48,753 --> 00:57:52,314
So they'll get an email notification saying, but you know, what?

988
00:57:52,856 --> 00:57:56,958
what my response was, and they can always just come talk to me if they feel like that

989
00:57:57,198 --> 00:57:59,019
wasn't a fair decision.

990
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:02,320
Hi.

991
00:58:03,741 --> 00:58:05,521
First of all, I want to say thank you for the talk.

992
00:58:06,182 --> 00:58:09,943
By experience, most of the talks that don't fit in the first time slot that they had are

993
00:58:09,983 --> 00:58:13,325
great talks, so in this metric, it was a good one.

994
00:58:14,465 --> 00:58:17,166
I have a small, small question that is...

995
00:58:17,847 --> 00:58:19,028
maybe be very long to answer.

996
00:58:20,811 --> 00:58:24,496
How do you deal with the fact that maybe when you highlight

997
00:58:24,516 --> 00:58:26,820
the problem you want the team to try to solve, they might

998
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:30,946
come back with a solution that you might not deem as

999
00:58:31,226 --> 00:58:32,268
efficient as another one?

1000
00:58:32,869 --> 00:58:35,010
But for them, it totally is what they want to do.

1001
00:58:35,350 --> 00:58:41,534
And how do you deal with this kind of diplomatic approach of that's not really 100% solving it?

1002
00:58:41,754 --> 00:58:44,876
Even if it's about, you know, deleting the knife, maybe you're like, yeah, but the knife, we need it.

1003
00:58:45,436 --> 00:58:51,059
We can't keep going with these items that are, you know, it's always the same, for example.

1004
00:58:51,199 --> 00:58:54,341
So how do you deal with this kind of difference of opinion that sometimes are

1005
00:58:54,361 --> 00:58:58,623
not resting on, you know, game design principles, which are very solid or...

1006
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,481
No, absolutely, it happens all the time. Really good question.

1007
00:59:03,321 --> 00:59:07,103
So, that is likeliest to happen at the start of the project,

1008
00:59:07,123 --> 00:59:09,643
when we're still trying to figure out what we're making, right?

1009
00:59:11,484 --> 00:59:15,485
The hope is that that starts to happen less and less and less,

1010
00:59:16,446 --> 00:59:21,467
if you can be eloquent about why a solution may or may not be good.

1011
00:59:21,867 --> 00:59:23,108
Very often you have to say,

1012
00:59:23,908 --> 00:59:24,728
interesting solution.

1013
00:59:25,679 --> 00:59:26,340
Let's put it in the game.

1014
00:59:26,941 --> 00:59:29,063
If it's a cheap thing to implement,

1015
00:59:29,464 --> 00:59:30,245
let's put it in the game.

1016
00:59:30,325 --> 00:59:31,486
Yeah, you wanna get rid of the knife,

1017
00:59:31,506 --> 00:59:33,008
let's get rid of the knife, let's play test it.

1018
00:59:34,450 --> 00:59:36,993
And perhaps you can even go as far as to say,

1019
00:59:37,774 --> 00:59:38,875
here's what I think is gonna happen.

1020
00:59:40,958 --> 00:59:42,440
I think play testers are gonna get tripped up

1021
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,663
for this specific reason.

1022
00:59:46,126 --> 00:59:52,130
and you run a playtest. We run playtests every Friday, so it's not super costly for us to do

1023
00:59:52,150 --> 00:59:56,834
this. And then you see what comes back. There's a chance that I was wrong. So there's a chance

1024
00:59:56,854 --> 01:00:00,957
that playtesters go through it and it's fine. It's actually a better thing for the game and

1025
01:00:00,977 --> 01:00:06,021
that's great. I learned something. And there's also a chance that, yep, no, it actually was

1026
01:00:06,061 --> 01:00:09,544
not a good solution. So what I try to do is I try to gauge.

1027
01:00:10,765 --> 01:00:12,625
can I invest in that process right now?

1028
01:00:12,645 --> 01:00:13,986
Because that's a great learning process

1029
01:00:14,006 --> 01:00:14,946
for everyone that's involved.

1030
01:00:15,326 --> 01:00:16,447
Do I have the time to spend?

1031
01:00:17,267 --> 01:00:18,227
Can the game spare?

1032
01:00:18,247 --> 01:00:21,328
You know, if we're talking about the third, fourth iteration

1033
01:00:21,448 --> 01:00:24,129
it's time to do an in-depth review and say,

1034
01:00:24,689 --> 01:00:27,010
let's very clearly define all these problems.

1035
01:00:27,050 --> 01:00:28,691
And before you put anything in the game,

1036
01:00:28,711 --> 01:00:30,731
you know, let's bring the solution back

1037
01:00:30,791 --> 01:00:33,532
and like poke at it really well.

1038
01:00:33,792 --> 01:00:37,934
And trying to use the tool of walking through it

1039
01:00:37,954 --> 01:00:38,754
in the player's shoes.

1040
01:00:40,204 --> 01:00:47,487
But I do have to consider, of course, every time the fact that I could be wrong.

1041
01:00:48,267 --> 01:00:52,589
So playtests tend to be the ultimate sort of test.

1042
01:00:53,209 --> 01:00:57,030
Is that playtest you do internally with your own team members,

1043
01:00:57,090 --> 01:01:01,492
or it's like playtest you contract a third party to do usually?

1044
01:01:02,166 --> 01:01:06,487
So we run all of our playtests ourselves, but we do a combination of calling people into the office,

1045
01:01:06,567 --> 01:01:09,848
which we can do now because the mask mandates have been lifted.

1046
01:01:10,648 --> 01:01:13,309
But also a lot of our I'm still fully remote.

1047
01:01:13,489 --> 01:01:18,611
So we use usertesting.com as a platform that we use where we can do live playtests

1048
01:01:19,051 --> 01:01:24,392
with people who own quests and we do them every Friday live and we run them remote.

1049
01:01:25,092 --> 01:01:26,573
OK, thank you for the information. Yeah.

1050
01:01:29,213 --> 01:01:31,595
Thank you for an excellent presentation.

1051
01:01:33,216 --> 01:01:39,420
My question is mostly around resources and moving folks

1052
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:41,461
onto the project or off the project

1053
01:01:41,541 --> 01:01:42,682
and how you navigated that.

1054
01:01:42,702 --> 01:01:46,184
I know Shell has multiple projects

1055
01:01:46,244 --> 01:01:47,105
running at the same time.

1056
01:01:48,266 --> 01:01:48,486
Thank you.

1057
01:01:48,727 --> 01:01:51,690
Precisely, yeah, this is a super complex question.

1058
01:01:52,731 --> 01:01:55,293
The the answer is what you just said, right?

1059
01:01:55,394 --> 01:01:57,355
Shell has multiple projects running at the same time.

1060
01:01:58,076 --> 01:02:02,220
And so some resources, some people become available or unavailable.

1061
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:05,043
And once in a while, you know, leadership will come to us and say,

1062
01:02:05,483 --> 01:02:06,985
we have someone who's not in a project right now.

1063
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:09,147
Can you use their time?

1064
01:02:09,367 --> 01:02:11,929
Or we'll go with a request as well of saying.

1065
01:02:13,931 --> 01:02:18,494
hey, if this person becomes available or someone with this skill set, then we can take that.

1066
01:02:18,594 --> 01:02:22,997
So it's a very shell game specific solution to the problem, which is like,

1067
01:02:23,898 --> 01:02:30,403
because we know how staffing works and we're able to sort of navigate the staffing requests,

1068
01:02:30,843 --> 01:02:34,285
we are able to see those down the pipe and

1069
01:02:35,106 --> 01:02:39,470
know, let leadership know what could be useful and they can, they can help us out where they can,

1070
01:02:39,570 --> 01:02:45,114
when they can. But again, it's, it's, I'm not sure how much lessons learned there could be there.

1071
01:02:45,454 --> 01:02:50,919
Perhaps if there's a students just like Shell, just because we do have, you know, six to 10

1072
01:02:50,999 --> 01:02:56,924
products at any given time. So there's just a lot of, a lot of flux in our, in our developers.

1073
01:03:01,387 --> 01:03:03,449
Sorry, I have another related question to that. Like,

1074
01:03:05,559 --> 01:03:18,651
When ramping people on, the project seemed to have a culture that was its own.

1075
01:03:18,671 --> 01:03:24,096
What were some of the challenges you ran into when moving new people

1076
01:03:24,156 --> 01:03:26,098
onto the project and having to onboard them?

1077
01:03:26,832 --> 01:03:37,967
Yeah, my, and this has to be the last question. So just to wrap up, my personal challenge for, for the design director perspective tended to be around on ramping with the,

1078
01:03:39,742 --> 01:03:43,504
the vocabulary for puzzle making in virtual reality.

1079
01:03:43,584 --> 01:03:47,707
So there was this steep learning curve for not just how to make puzzles,

1080
01:03:47,787 --> 01:03:51,349
but how to make puzzles in VR for our, you know,

1081
01:03:51,549 --> 01:03:53,451
our game is a little bit of a physics sandbox.

1082
01:03:53,691 --> 01:03:56,092
So that that tended to be it was less.

1083
01:03:58,211 --> 01:04:03,212
Most of us know each other at Shell, so you can sort of jump into projects and you have a good chance of knowing,

1084
01:04:03,893 --> 01:04:08,053
unless you're new to the company, of knowing a lot of people on the team, so you can be adopted very quickly.

1085
01:04:08,534 --> 01:04:17,956
So it was more around the language, the tools, the gameplay, the puzzle making, that we had to have a very steep learning curve.

1086
01:04:17,976 --> 01:04:21,177
All right, thank you, everyone.
