1
00:00:06,042 --> 00:00:09,407
Hi, I have the pleasure to introduce you to a little session today,

2
00:00:09,427 --> 00:00:11,830
the Impossible Quest Getting a Job in Games.

3
00:00:12,451 --> 00:00:15,615
My name is Masha, and together with this group of industry professionals,

4
00:00:15,955 --> 00:00:19,841
we will try to break it down for you into some practical tips and tricks from our side.

5
00:00:20,622 --> 00:00:24,246
We want to show you seven different angles on how to pursue said impossible quest.

6
00:00:25,533 --> 00:00:27,034
Here are a couple of things that are good to know.

7
00:00:27,434 --> 00:00:30,856
So first of all, this intro and the sessions are prerecorded,

8
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:33,077
but our speakers will be available in the chat

9
00:00:33,177 --> 00:00:34,238
during their talks.

10
00:00:34,778 --> 00:00:37,000
So make sure to ask a couple of questions,

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,801
and we will try to make sure to answer them as good as we can.

12
00:00:41,042 --> 00:00:47,364
This is a micro talk session and that means it consists out of seven talks and each talk is going to be seven minutes long.

13
00:00:48,484 --> 00:00:57,007
A while after the GDC, you will receive an email with a session evaluation sheet and it would be awesome if you could then also evaluate our session.

14
00:00:58,507 --> 00:01:03,409
And for additional information about the micro talks and in general, please check the schedule online.

15
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,401
So we have a broad variety of speakers,

16
00:01:07,461 --> 00:01:09,242
and we are located all around the world.

17
00:01:09,442 --> 00:01:12,143
And they are going to introduce themselves in just a bit.

18
00:01:12,663 --> 00:01:14,304
And all of us come from different backgrounds.

19
00:01:14,724 --> 00:01:17,185
So we can bring our own unique advice to the table.

20
00:01:17,965 --> 00:01:20,486
And our session targets not only freshmen to the industry,

21
00:01:20,586 --> 00:01:22,967
but is also meant as a motivation for people

22
00:01:23,047 --> 00:01:25,528
who might be already settled in a different field

23
00:01:25,588 --> 00:01:28,449
and would love to pursue their passion for making games,

24
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:31,291
or for game developers of all kinds

25
00:01:31,511 --> 00:01:33,611
that are right now looking for new opportunities.

26
00:01:34,585 --> 00:01:38,547
We're going to cover topics and important topics such as moving,

27
00:01:38,607 --> 00:01:42,989
networking, portfolios, imposter syndrome, knowing your strengths and weaknesses,

28
00:01:43,389 --> 00:01:45,150
how to be brave and many more.

29
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:49,732
And I'd say let's jump right into it and say hi to Roni.

30
00:01:49,992 --> 00:01:50,692
We see us later.

31
00:01:51,373 --> 00:01:54,734
Hello, I'm Roni, a dialogue engineer and editor at OWN London,

32
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:56,655
a dialogue production house for video games.

33
00:01:56,875 --> 00:02:00,677
I've worked on games like Desperados 3, Biomutant, Medium and Demon Souls.

34
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:04,794
I'm here to talk to you about where to start your journey in video games as it's super

35
00:02:04,814 --> 00:02:08,879
important to set yourself up for really good opportunities while in school and even prior

36
00:02:08,939 --> 00:02:09,680
to going to school.

37
00:02:11,362 --> 00:02:15,566
The first step on any journey into a career is knowing which field of study you want to

38
00:02:15,606 --> 00:02:16,107
go into.

39
00:02:16,367 --> 00:02:20,532
This, as a lot of us might know, is easier said than done, and that's totally okay.

40
00:02:21,264 --> 00:02:26,247
it's good that you have just a general idea of where you want to end up. So pick something.

41
00:02:26,687 --> 00:02:31,130
For instance, I knew that I wanted to end up in games eventually, so I picked 3D animation

42
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:35,933
and art because it really interested me at the time. Character building because it was just

43
00:02:35,973 --> 00:02:40,276
really important to me. But then I ended up going into audio further down the line,

44
00:02:40,856 --> 00:02:44,779
specifically into dialogue production. In a way, it was pretty much the same thing,

45
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:46,020
but just a different field.

46
00:02:46,918 --> 00:02:54,505
Going off of this though, it's very possible that you'll find out what you want to do further into your studies, so it's okay not to know immediately.

47
00:02:55,165 --> 00:03:00,190
You might even find out possibly 10 years or 20 years down the line into an already established career.

48
00:03:01,151 --> 00:03:05,535
Everyone's path is never going to be linear and definitely going to be different,

49
00:03:06,175 --> 00:03:10,179
but the important thing is that you keep your options open to anything and everything.

50
00:03:10,539 --> 00:03:13,842
I didn't really think that I was going to end up in audio, yet here I am.

51
00:03:15,613 --> 00:03:21,295
The next step after finding what you want to study is where to study, locations specifically.

52
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:26,557
There are a lot of places around the world for this, but I'll mainly be talking about

53
00:03:26,577 --> 00:03:30,139
the US schools since it's pretty much the only country that I know.

54
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:32,920
I'll mainly be talking about those.

55
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:37,922
So during my research into finding schools for myself, I found out that most of the schools

56
00:03:37,962 --> 00:03:42,684
that I could study game design for were on the east and west coast of America.

57
00:03:43,414 --> 00:03:47,296
and I grew up in a really small town in Texas, which if you're not familiar with the geography

58
00:03:47,316 --> 00:03:53,178
of the states is the exact center of the country. So I had to make a choice and take that really big

59
00:03:53,218 --> 00:03:57,920
leap of faith and move to the west coast to continue my education and to find work.

60
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,202
This is something that's very common within the gaming industry, so be prepared to move.

61
00:04:03,962 --> 00:04:09,084
Especially when starting out, you need to consider anywhere and everywhere as a possible location for

62
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:12,585
yourself and take that leap of faith to get the experience that you need.

63
00:04:13,267 --> 00:04:20,456
Luckily for this day and age, the internet exists, so it'll make the process a bit easier to stay in touch with friends and family.

64
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:28,687
I've gone ahead and listed out a few US and European schools for you guys, European schools provided by my fellow speakers on this talk.

65
00:04:31,245 --> 00:04:35,869
On top of moving locations for school, it's also really important to know how much you're

66
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:41,553
willing to spend for schools. Weighing how much you want someone to teach you the hard skills you

67
00:04:41,593 --> 00:04:47,758
need versus how much you're willing to learn on your own. This is university versus vocational.

68
00:04:48,679 --> 00:04:54,604
Available schools like universities can be full-blown with entrance barriers and everything

69
00:04:54,624 --> 00:05:00,148
like that, which is kind of like CalArts or SCAD, to vocational schools like the one I went to in

70
00:05:00,188 --> 00:05:00,588
Paramind.

71
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,183
The former will give you loads of experience and time to create work to put on your portfolio,

72
00:05:06,443 --> 00:05:11,346
collaborate with students outside of your own field, and possibly even internship programs

73
00:05:11,386 --> 00:05:16,669
to help you get a leg up in the field. The latter will be a much, much cheaper and quick way to

74
00:05:16,729 --> 00:05:22,232
learn hard skills, but you likely won't get to collaborate with students outside of your own

75
00:05:22,312 --> 00:05:27,035
field or gain luxuries like internship programs and years to flesh out a portfolio.

76
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:33,576
costs are no laughing matter, which is why it's important to consider these options.

77
00:05:33,776 --> 00:05:38,001
Schools can be really, really expensive. When it comes to university in the States,

78
00:05:38,842 --> 00:05:42,166
a lot of the ones I came across were about $26k per year.

79
00:05:43,007 --> 00:05:47,113
So definitely look into all the pros and cons for the school that you want to go into.

80
00:05:47,862 --> 00:05:51,726
There are ways to reduce these costs if you do choose to go to university like living

81
00:05:51,786 --> 00:05:58,573
off campus or scholarships even, which can be a good way to reduce the costs.

82
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,917
There are some really, really niche scholarships out there.

83
00:06:02,638 --> 00:06:07,222
One of the ones I've come across in Texas was the Tall Texan Scholarships for females,

84
00:06:07,623 --> 00:06:09,885
which I qualified for because I'm just really tall.

85
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:17,451
There is also the option to learn on your own, which is a completely viable option and totally okay.

86
00:06:18,631 --> 00:06:23,112
Definitely something to consider as well. The only issue is that you will have to have a lot

87
00:06:23,192 --> 00:06:30,374
of dedication and willpower, I guess, to learn all the necessary things that you need to learn.

88
00:06:30,835 --> 00:06:33,095
There's also, it doesn't give you the

89
00:06:34,075 --> 00:06:39,317
networking availability and stuff like that. If you have any questions on this particular topic,

90
00:06:39,377 --> 00:06:44,518
feel free to simply DM us in any of our social tags we've provided or ask questions in the chat.

91
00:06:46,499 --> 00:06:50,180
Finally, there's what to do while you're at school. Super important,

92
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,901
try out everything and anything while at school. This is the time to get really, really niche.

93
00:06:55,592 --> 00:06:59,854
It'll help you know exactly what you want to do, be that working on indies or triple

94
00:06:59,934 --> 00:07:03,096
A's, story-based games, roguelike games, list goes on.

95
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:05,838
Or even start your own company, honestly.

96
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:07,359
The world is your oyster at this time.

97
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:12,402
And also, while it's really important to keep to your studies and make sure you learn everything

98
00:07:12,442 --> 00:07:18,265
you need to, it's also a great time to be social because this is where your networking

99
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:18,725
begins.

100
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:21,467
It's also really important to have friends as well.

101
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:28,015
But depending on your school or area that you're the world in the of the world that you're in and what it offers you,

102
00:07:28,035 --> 00:07:35,081
these things to be social can be as simple as collaborating on projects at school or signing up for game jams.

103
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:42,928
One particular really good game jam location or information post, I guess you could say, is itch.io.

104
00:07:42,968 --> 00:07:47,692
They have a whole calendar listed there for all the online game jams that they have going on.

105
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:53,916
Another thing is you can go to meetups to get to know people outside of your own school

106
00:07:54,377 --> 00:07:56,980
and possibly even meet some folks in the industry already.

107
00:07:57,721 --> 00:07:59,643
As Klaus might mention in his talk already,

108
00:08:00,324 --> 00:08:03,928
it's also really important to get to know your teachers and staff around your school.

109
00:08:04,763 --> 00:08:07,767
because even the humblest of people, people you would never really expect,

110
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:11,193
could help you get later down the line or even vice versa.

111
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:15,119
I have plenty of friends who have gotten work through their former teachers or

112
00:08:15,179 --> 00:08:18,284
even vice versa due to just having kept in touch over the years.

113
00:08:19,826 --> 00:08:20,387
Overall though,

114
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:24,931
this is the time to really explore who you are as a person and begin something really exciting.

115
00:08:25,191 --> 00:08:29,652
So don't let those nerves stand in your way and just help out everyone and anyone because you

116
00:08:29,672 --> 00:08:34,054
never know what might happen. But thank you for listening and I hope to see some of your faces

117
00:08:34,234 --> 00:08:40,416
at future events. Hi, my name is Pasha Camino and we already met at the intro. In my section

118
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:45,357
I would like to talk about networking through volunteering and the graces of imposter syndrome.

119
00:08:46,386 --> 00:08:49,328
So quickly about me, I'm a game designer in the Berlin-based

120
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:51,109
indie game studio called Maschinen Mensch.

121
00:08:51,569 --> 00:08:53,250
And when we're not dealing with a pandemic,

122
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:55,891
I'm also in charge of quite a couple of cool game events,

123
00:08:56,372 --> 00:09:00,354
such as Devolution, Berlin Games Week, Temisphere, Womanize,

124
00:09:00,474 --> 00:09:02,595
Talk and Play, and a bunch of cool game jams.

125
00:09:03,736 --> 00:09:06,117
So as I mentioned, I'd like to focus

126
00:09:06,177 --> 00:09:08,079
on how to build your own small network,

127
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:09,980
and presumably through volunteering.

128
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:17,154
So as we heard earlier from Roni, it's not unusual to move to a new town for education or for a new job.

129
00:09:17,575 --> 00:09:21,998
And I know this can be quite intimidating, moving to a foreign place without knowing anyone.

130
00:09:22,758 --> 00:09:29,763
But the good thing is that if you move somewhere for games, there is a pretty high chance that some sort of game scene already exists.

131
00:09:30,443 --> 00:09:35,046
And now it's basically just a little bit up to you to find it and to get yourself involved.

132
00:09:37,271 --> 00:09:42,895
Yeah, and like Reni suggested, you can find cool events at the academic institution of

133
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,457
your choice or through the company that you're working for.

134
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:51,482
They often already have cool internal offers, such as game jams, open mics, dojos, board

135
00:09:51,502 --> 00:09:53,303
game evenings, and many more things.

136
00:09:54,264 --> 00:09:55,845
Another thing would be game jams.

137
00:09:56,205 --> 00:09:57,026
I love game jams.

138
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:57,806
They are great.

139
00:09:57,926 --> 00:10:00,348
They are so much fun and they're a great way to network.

140
00:10:00,846 --> 00:10:07,671
They're also challenging and technically challenging, but also a good opportunity to get to know others.

141
00:10:08,312 --> 00:10:15,618
And there are many different game jams with many different topics, so it should be possible to find something that's particularly interesting for you.

142
00:10:17,259 --> 00:10:25,046
And at the end of my presentation, I will also have a link to a sheet with useful resources, for example, lists of game jams, so make sure to check that out.

143
00:10:26,941 --> 00:10:30,443
Yeah, so in general, if you're looking for game-related events,

144
00:10:30,743 --> 00:10:35,165
you can often find cool events on Twitter, Facebook, Meetup,

145
00:10:35,586 --> 00:10:36,966
and Discord servers.

146
00:10:37,267 --> 00:10:39,468
I will also have a list of Discord servers in that link.

147
00:10:40,028 --> 00:10:42,249
And of course, these are just a couple of examples.

148
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:45,371
Another cool way to look for it is basically

149
00:10:45,391 --> 00:10:49,273
to type into Google game event plus the name of the city

150
00:10:49,313 --> 00:10:50,574
that you're living or working in,

151
00:10:51,054 --> 00:10:52,875
and you'll be surprised about the results.

152
00:10:53,276 --> 00:10:57,703
And if you don't find something there, then maybe in the next larger city located to you.

153
00:10:58,765 --> 00:11:01,710
And if you then found something that's interesting to you,

154
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:04,595
then also don't hesitate to actually go there.

155
00:11:05,678 --> 00:11:08,360
OK, you managed to find an event that you're interested in,

156
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,940
and you actually went there.

157
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,481
Super well done already.

158
00:11:12,961 --> 00:11:15,442
But I know the feeling very well of thinking

159
00:11:15,482 --> 00:11:16,983
you don't actually belong there.

160
00:11:17,483 --> 00:11:20,384
You don't contribute anything, or you have nothing to say.

161
00:11:20,744 --> 00:11:23,805
But trust me, these events are practically made for you.

162
00:11:24,146 --> 00:11:27,547
The minority of people have any idea of what they're doing.

163
00:11:28,627 --> 00:11:32,149
And we all like certain parts of games or game developments.

164
00:11:32,549 --> 00:11:34,830
And that's already enough to start a conversation.

165
00:11:35,418 --> 00:11:37,839
It's still easy to feel quite lost on an event,

166
00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:40,220
but the more specific advice on how to network

167
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,281
will be brought to you later on by Klaus,

168
00:11:42,441 --> 00:11:43,762
so stay tuned for this too.

169
00:11:45,022 --> 00:11:49,024
And I know what easily makes us feel alienated or uncoordinated

170
00:11:49,224 --> 00:11:52,105
at such an event is not to have a real goal.

171
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,966
And therefore, one of my favorite approaches

172
00:11:55,986 --> 00:11:59,007
to networking is, especially if you're a student

173
00:11:59,287 --> 00:12:01,808
or if you are a junior, is through volunteering.

174
00:12:04,193 --> 00:12:07,134
So find yourself a goal for the evening and one could be volunteering.

175
00:12:07,154 --> 00:12:11,795
Volunteering is great and if you don't know what it is, let me quickly run it down for you.

176
00:12:12,516 --> 00:12:16,937
Basically, almost every event has helping hands in the background of the event to ensure that

177
00:12:17,017 --> 00:12:23,980
everything runs smoothly. Many tasks are taken over by these volunteers at an event, for example,

178
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:28,402
taking care of the batch booth, the seating, the stage preparation, technical assistance,

179
00:12:28,802 --> 00:12:29,722
and many more tasks.

180
00:12:30,523 --> 00:12:34,186
And at these events, basically everyone can apply to become a volunteer.

181
00:12:35,167 --> 00:12:38,189
And you gain a bunch of nice advantages through that.

182
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:41,392
So for example, a free conference pass, you meet the speakers,

183
00:12:41,752 --> 00:12:46,256
you get to see the speakers on stage, you get to see behind the curtains of a game event,

184
00:12:46,316 --> 00:12:48,058
which is also pretty cool.

185
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:52,561
You meet the attendees, and most importantly, you meet fellow volunteers.

186
00:12:53,762 --> 00:12:54,923
So, yeah.

187
00:12:56,763 --> 00:13:02,786
And some of the goals or tasks can be door duty or greeting people, handing out programs,

188
00:13:03,606 --> 00:13:08,968
guiding people to the right stages, handing out badges, and many, many, many more things.

189
00:13:09,648 --> 00:13:14,590
So while you're actually having fun at this event, you're being able to listen to a bunch of talks,

190
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:20,233
meeting cool people, you're also helping to create a nice atmosphere, you know, a good atmosphere

191
00:13:20,373 --> 00:13:25,395
and making the event run smoothly for everyone and creating a great experience then for everyone too.

192
00:13:26,842 --> 00:13:31,927
Yeah, and even if you're not a volunteer, goals can help you to network, to ease your

193
00:13:31,967 --> 00:13:32,828
mind basically.

194
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:37,132
For example, a goal could be, I want to talk to one other person tonight.

195
00:13:37,532 --> 00:13:40,155
I want to get one other business card tonight.

196
00:13:40,615 --> 00:13:43,478
Or I want to introduce myself to at least one other person.

197
00:13:44,119 --> 00:13:46,101
And that can help you to move on from there.

198
00:13:46,441 --> 00:13:49,664
So a big thumbs up from my side, volunteering is highly recommended.

199
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:53,072
Yeah, and how to become a volunteer you ask yourself.

200
00:13:53,112 --> 00:13:56,295
And I think the easiest way to find volunteer opportunities

201
00:13:56,435 --> 00:14:00,338
is to basically type into Google the game event name of your choice

202
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:01,880
and the word volunteer.

203
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,962
For example, GDC plus volunteer and you'll find something.

204
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:08,373
And don't let your imposter syndrome stop you.

205
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:11,977
I know, of course, that many insecurities still apply,

206
00:14:11,997 --> 00:14:15,081
even if you have a goal for the evening,

207
00:14:15,101 --> 00:14:18,284
or you still think you're not important enough

208
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:19,245
to talk to anyone.

209
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:21,568
And I know that I'm repeating myself here a little bit,

210
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:23,310
but it's just so important because...

211
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:29,312
you definitely belong, okay? So second, you're for sure not the only person feeling like this

212
00:14:29,512 --> 00:14:35,353
tonight and you can presumably even find someone looking as overwhelmed as you do and then tackle

213
00:14:35,373 --> 00:14:39,694
the task together. That could be a fellow volunteer for example. At least that's what

214
00:14:39,794 --> 00:14:45,335
I did a couple of times and it worked out pretty well for me. Another thing is that

215
00:14:45,395 --> 00:14:47,116
please take one step at a time.

216
00:14:49,093 --> 00:14:53,578
You know, take your experiences from one event to the next one and improve from there.

217
00:14:53,918 --> 00:14:55,099
We all start somewhere.

218
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:58,422
And also, do not be too hard on yourself.

219
00:14:59,503 --> 00:15:00,825
I know it's easier said than done.

220
00:15:01,807 --> 00:15:07,253
And on a general note, keep in mind that developers that you will meet might have produced insanely

221
00:15:07,313 --> 00:15:10,577
cool games, but at the end of the day, they are also just humans.

222
00:15:11,317 --> 00:15:15,742
And trying not to be too starstruck was one of the best advices that I've ever gotten.

223
00:15:16,403 --> 00:15:19,326
And they presumably like games just as much as you do.

224
00:15:19,446 --> 00:15:22,469
And if they do not want to talk to you, they will let you know.

225
00:15:24,626 --> 00:15:28,907
But please do not miss out on a chance to talk to someone that you're truly inspired

226
00:15:28,967 --> 00:15:33,929
by because you think you're not good enough or you have nothing of value to contribute

227
00:15:34,229 --> 00:15:35,349
to that conversation.

228
00:15:36,349 --> 00:15:41,331
So I'd say use some well-deserved confidence, please not too much, and build up your own

229
00:15:41,351 --> 00:15:44,151
network and I'm very sure that you can do it.

230
00:15:45,257 --> 00:15:47,518
So if you then found someone you want to work with,

231
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:49,579
then you might need a portfolio,

232
00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:52,380
and that will be brought to you by Raymond in the next piece.

233
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,181
So thank you for listening.

234
00:15:54,481 --> 00:15:55,941
Make sure to ask all the questions,

235
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:57,442
and if you still have more questions,

236
00:15:57,522 --> 00:15:58,562
reach out to me on Twitter.

237
00:15:59,463 --> 00:16:01,384
Thanks again, and say hi to Raymond.

238
00:16:02,324 --> 00:16:02,964
Hello, everybody.

239
00:16:03,104 --> 00:16:03,644
My name is Raymond.

240
00:16:03,885 --> 00:16:04,645
I'm a level designer,

241
00:16:04,805 --> 00:16:06,726
and I have my own indie studio called RoofCant.

242
00:16:07,146 --> 00:16:08,526
Thank you so much for coming to our talk.

243
00:16:09,611 --> 00:16:13,572
I should just introduce you to getting your own network and getting started.

244
00:16:13,852 --> 00:16:17,053
Once you've actually got your network, it's going to be really important to be able to

245
00:16:17,093 --> 00:16:18,474
show people what exactly you can do.

246
00:16:18,874 --> 00:16:20,974
And that's where portfolios come in extremely handy.

247
00:16:21,254 --> 00:16:25,816
So I'm going to give you a number of practical tips on how to get the most out of your portfolio.

248
00:16:26,891 --> 00:16:29,292
Starting off, finishing a game is incredibly difficult.

249
00:16:29,452 --> 00:16:32,453
So if you actually manage to get through the entire game development process,

250
00:16:32,813 --> 00:16:35,654
maybe even release your game on something like itch.io or on Steam,

251
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:37,494
that's fantastic to show on your portfolio.

252
00:16:37,974 --> 00:16:41,636
It shows that you've actually gone through all of the different phases in game development

253
00:16:41,936 --> 00:16:45,297
and got the experience out of that, on top of being extremely perseverant

254
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:47,457
for being able to actually complete an entire game.

255
00:16:47,938 --> 00:16:50,558
That's something that not a lot of people just entering the industry have,

256
00:16:50,618 --> 00:16:52,419
so that's fantastic to show on your portfolio.

257
00:16:53,827 --> 00:16:57,448
Secondly, it's going to be really important to show that you can collaborate in a team and work

258
00:16:57,488 --> 00:17:01,130
together with others because very likely that's what you're going to be doing at whatever company

259
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:04,971
you're applying for. So if you've got any school projects that you've done together with other

260
00:17:04,991 --> 00:17:08,453
students, if you've done any game jams together in a team, that's fantastic to show in your

261
00:17:08,473 --> 00:17:12,655
portfolio as well. Now if you don't have any of this experience working in a team, as has been

262
00:17:12,695 --> 00:17:16,496
mentioned before in this talk, game jams are a fantastic opportunity to get started.

263
00:17:17,857 --> 00:17:21,398
One thing that is really important when you are showing off work that you've done in a team

264
00:17:21,758 --> 00:17:26,379
is to explain what exactly you did. Show what your contribution was. For example,

265
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:29,860
if you're an environment artist and you're showing a screenshot of the project you did

266
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,862
and they chose a really beautiful looking building and then some random floating cubes right next to

267
00:17:33,922 --> 00:17:38,483
it, people might judge you on the entire thing if you don't explain that you made that beautiful

268
00:17:38,523 --> 00:17:42,384
looking building and some level designer decided it would be fun to place cubes everywhere because

269
00:17:42,404 --> 00:17:43,825
that's what we level designers love to do.

270
00:17:44,837 --> 00:17:49,364
So basically make it very clear what exactly you did on the project and that becomes even more

271
00:17:49,424 --> 00:17:53,291
important when you've worked together with other people of the same discipline. If you work together

272
00:17:53,331 --> 00:17:57,498
with three other environment artists it's even more relevant to show what is yours and what is

273
00:17:57,518 --> 00:17:58,519
the work of somebody else.

274
00:18:00,142 --> 00:18:04,543
Now if your work is a lot less visual, for example you're a game designer, you're a programmer, maybe you're a producer,

275
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:10,245
it can be really helpful to illustrate your process to show what kind of things you thought about,

276
00:18:10,345 --> 00:18:13,705
what kind of decisions you made throughout the process of creating this project.

277
00:18:14,286 --> 00:18:19,427
This can really give the person who is reviewing your portfolio an idea of whether you have the

278
00:18:19,447 --> 00:18:23,328
kind of game development insight or the kind of problem-solving skills that they are looking for.

279
00:18:24,493 --> 00:18:27,735
that's also really relevant to show work that you've done in your personal time.

280
00:18:28,235 --> 00:18:32,658
Things that you have spent your free, personal, precious time on can really show what motivates

281
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:37,381
you and especially if that fits with whatever you're applying for, that can be really helpful

282
00:18:37,621 --> 00:18:41,624
to show that you're passionate about this thing you actually are gonna hopefully be doing for money.

283
00:18:43,365 --> 00:18:46,528
Now, all right, I've just shown you a number of things that would be really good to include in

284
00:18:46,548 --> 00:18:51,773
your portfolio, but obviously pick your best stuff. You shouldn't show a whole list of 20

285
00:18:52,273 --> 00:18:55,796
projects that you did out of which some are really good and some are kind of mediocre,

286
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:59,940
because the person looking at your portfolio is not going to have a lot of time. And so if they

287
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,583
scroll through your portfolio and click on one that happens to not be your best project,

288
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:06,265
then they're going to judge you based on that. And that would be a shame.

289
00:19:06,806 --> 00:19:10,308
I've actually done this quite wrong myself at some point when I had an interview and

290
00:19:10,328 --> 00:19:14,249
I was asked to walk through my portfolio, kind of show the different types of experiences

291
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:15,170
I've had.

292
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:19,912
And I started with a game jam that I did, which, you know, I liked, but it wasn't my

293
00:19:19,952 --> 00:19:24,634
best work because I thought I would build it up to this awesome stuff I really wanted

294
00:19:24,654 --> 00:19:25,134
to talk about.

295
00:19:25,194 --> 00:19:28,436
And then they started asking me critical questions about this game jam that I did.

296
00:19:28,456 --> 00:19:32,157
And I just was like, please, can we move on to the stuff I'm more proud of?

297
00:19:32,978 --> 00:19:33,698
That was a bad idea.

298
00:19:33,818 --> 00:19:34,638
Please do not do that.

299
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:40,462
So you want to show your best stuff, but you also want to make sure that you really take into account

300
00:19:40,502 --> 00:19:44,385
what exactly you're applying for. If you're applying for AAA, then the people looking at

301
00:19:44,425 --> 00:19:48,887
your portfolio are going to expect a much more specialized skill set. If you're looking for

302
00:19:48,908 --> 00:19:53,330
an indie project, if you're joining an indie team, then they might actually be quite happy

303
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,791
that you can do multiple different things.

304
00:19:55,888 --> 00:20:03,975
What's also really interesting is to consider whether any of the products you've done fit directly into the kind of work that the company you're applying for does.

305
00:20:04,055 --> 00:20:15,665
For example, if you're an artist and you've made work in the style that the company you're applying for uses, that can be really relevant because that lets them see immediately whether you would be a good fit for their team and their kind of projects.

306
00:20:16,145 --> 00:20:24,312
With game designers or programmers, that would be something like working on systems that these companies that you're applying for have used in the past.

307
00:20:26,182 --> 00:20:30,225
Lastly, very important, get feedback. Show others your portfolio, show it to your friends,

308
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:35,528
to other people that are looking for a job in the industry. Try and get portfolio reviews because

309
00:20:35,949 --> 00:20:39,711
just like a game, your portfolio is never finished. You can keep improving on it and

310
00:20:40,212 --> 00:20:43,194
hopefully at some point you won't need to anymore because you will have a job. Yay!

311
00:20:44,245 --> 00:20:45,386
All right, that was my list.

312
00:20:46,427 --> 00:20:51,451
And now that I have a little bit of time left, I can actually go through one example of my

313
00:20:51,651 --> 00:20:52,231
own portfolio.

314
00:20:52,692 --> 00:20:54,533
So this is a project I did in university.

315
00:20:54,593 --> 00:20:57,856
If you go to the front page of my portfolio, scroll through it a bit, you'll find this.

316
00:20:58,516 --> 00:21:01,959
And what this already shows you is it shows a little bit about what the actual game is,

317
00:21:01,979 --> 00:21:05,582
but it also shows some awards recognition, why you might care, why you might want to

318
00:21:05,602 --> 00:21:05,942
click on this.

319
00:21:06,502 --> 00:21:10,766
and it immediately shows some of that my contribution part that I was talking about earlier

320
00:21:11,347 --> 00:21:16,372
because this was a team of 18 people, more at some point, so I think it's really important

321
00:21:16,392 --> 00:21:19,115
to immediately highlight this is the part that I actually worked on.

322
00:21:20,253 --> 00:21:24,276
Now, if you click on the project page, you're going to see a lot of just kind of standard info.

323
00:21:24,296 --> 00:21:26,338
You see the trailer, you see a description fact sheet.

324
00:21:26,758 --> 00:21:30,381
But if you then go further, you will see my contribution worked out much more.

325
00:21:30,401 --> 00:21:38,407
I show illustrations that I made to kind of highlight how I try to communicate to the rest of the team what I thought this game might look like at some point.

326
00:21:38,727 --> 00:21:44,891
You see prototypes that I made where I tested out whether the mechanics we were trying to work with, whether they would actually work, whether they would be fun.

327
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:50,814
We actually tried out a bunch of puzzles in that, and I explained that in these few images.

328
00:21:51,454 --> 00:21:53,875
It shows some of the sketches, some of the illustrations that I made.

329
00:21:54,415 --> 00:21:58,837
And showing all of this, obviously, not everybody going through my portfolio is going to read all of this.

330
00:21:59,257 --> 00:22:03,379
But seeing all these different methods that I used, hopefully will give them an idea of my process,

331
00:22:03,479 --> 00:22:06,260
of how I work, and whether I would be a good fit in their team.

332
00:22:07,813 --> 00:22:09,155
So that was my part of this talk.

333
00:22:09,195 --> 00:22:10,195
Thank you so much for listening.

334
00:22:10,456 --> 00:22:11,256
If you want to stay in touch,

335
00:22:11,276 --> 00:22:13,658
you can reach me on Twitter at Roof Guide Games.

336
00:22:14,579 --> 00:22:16,340
And up next, Diana will give you some insight

337
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,362
from her perspective as a recruiter.

338
00:22:18,802 --> 00:22:19,583
Thank you so much for listening.

339
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:20,603
See you in the industry.

340
00:22:21,024 --> 00:22:22,625
Hi everyone, I'm Diana,

341
00:22:22,945 --> 00:22:25,788
and I welcome you to my talk, Inside Recruiting.

342
00:22:27,109 --> 00:22:29,831
I've been working in the industry for about 80 years now

343
00:22:29,991 --> 00:22:33,674
in varying capacities, one of which is as a recruiter.

344
00:22:33,994 --> 00:22:37,216
And as such, I've seen very different kinds of applications.

345
00:22:38,158 --> 00:22:41,399
Now that Raymond told you about how to set up a great portfolio,

346
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:44,460
I would like to tell you how we might look at your application.

347
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,962
What else we'd like to know about you, and especially how not to apply.

348
00:22:49,782 --> 00:22:53,023
So the first thing I will usually see is your

349
00:22:53,183 --> 00:22:58,385
email address or username. Please get a proper email address.

350
00:22:59,245 --> 00:23:03,967
Usually the chances for son of a bitch or mafia militia are not very high to be

351
00:23:03,987 --> 00:23:04,887
taken seriously.

352
00:23:05,864 --> 00:23:08,386
And also, if you maybe have multiple email addresses,

353
00:23:09,086 --> 00:23:11,048
check if you are locked into the proper one

354
00:23:11,088 --> 00:23:12,909
before sending out your application.

355
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:14,911
You might regret it otherwise.

356
00:23:16,192 --> 00:23:17,613
The same thing goes for username.

357
00:23:18,334 --> 00:23:21,736
If you contact me on Discord or another platform, which

358
00:23:21,877 --> 00:23:24,699
actually might happen if I'm looking

359
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:28,222
for a small indie company, and then you

360
00:23:28,262 --> 00:23:30,804
don't have your real name as a username,

361
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:35,428
please start the actual chat with, hi, my name is.

362
00:23:37,174 --> 00:23:43,079
A name only consisting of maybe emojis and no follow up to get to know who you actually

363
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:48,223
are is not what I would like to see on a first base for a job interview.

364
00:23:49,544 --> 00:23:52,426
The next important thing is please talk to me.

365
00:23:52,446 --> 00:24:00,633
Hi is not really an application and please get me this job isn't either.

366
00:24:01,754 --> 00:24:06,217
This is really not a good way to address your recruiter and to introduce yourself to them.

367
00:24:07,173 --> 00:24:10,455
The same goes for almost empty messages or emails.

368
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:13,136
We are usually asking for certain documents,

369
00:24:13,236 --> 00:24:16,337
and I cannot count the times I receive an application

370
00:24:16,918 --> 00:24:18,118
with almost nothing in there.

371
00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:22,120
So please, say something about who you are,

372
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,681
what you've worked on before, and please

373
00:24:24,741 --> 00:24:26,542
attach the documents and information

374
00:24:26,602 --> 00:24:27,522
we are asking for.

375
00:24:27,642 --> 00:24:28,562
We sure want them.

376
00:24:29,963 --> 00:24:31,584
But how do you start it all?

377
00:24:32,924 --> 00:24:35,145
First off, read the job posting.

378
00:24:36,069 --> 00:24:41,492
Show me that you actually understood what I am looking for and that this is why you are writing to me.

379
00:24:42,212 --> 00:24:46,815
Also, never offer your talent for free, especially not if I'm offering a paid role.

380
00:24:47,835 --> 00:24:51,077
Make sure that you specify what you are applying for.

381
00:24:51,477 --> 00:24:56,600
I might actually have several openings, even for different companies, if we talk indie freelance.

382
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:03,144
So mention which company and which position you are applying for and introduce yourself with your profession.

383
00:25:07,238 --> 00:25:11,420
On the other hand, of course, you can always send in an unsolicited application.

384
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:14,642
Maybe you are lucky and we are actually looking for you.

385
00:25:15,242 --> 00:25:17,744
Some companies even offer that option on their website.

386
00:25:18,364 --> 00:25:21,466
Or maybe you find the recruiter on LinkedIn. Just ask them.

387
00:25:23,327 --> 00:25:26,248
Now, after talking about your first approach

388
00:25:27,029 --> 00:25:31,471
and content of your application, I want to stress a very important detail

389
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:36,814
about the general appearance, which is, please help me understand you.

390
00:25:37,884 --> 00:25:40,385
I might just drop your application if I cannot read it.

391
00:25:40,945 --> 00:25:43,887
And with that, I mean, please don't send in your CV

392
00:25:44,087 --> 00:25:46,729
or application in your mother tongue

393
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:50,711
if the company is not using that language as a company

394
00:25:50,751 --> 00:25:51,532
language anyway.

395
00:25:52,472 --> 00:25:54,193
Keep in mind that your recruiter might not

396
00:25:54,294 --> 00:25:55,314
understand this language.

397
00:25:56,795 --> 00:26:01,438
So also keep in mind image resolutions.

398
00:26:01,978 --> 00:26:05,400
If you send in your portfolio and your CV.

399
00:26:06,987 --> 00:26:09,929
Make it a PDF. This is always the best thing that you can do.

400
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:14,391
Try checking your grammar. Very important thing.

401
00:26:14,411 --> 00:26:18,994
A simple spellcheck tool can improve your application immensely.

402
00:26:19,014 --> 00:26:22,516
And these are just the basics of a good application.

403
00:26:22,536 --> 00:26:27,638
But how do you deal with possible rejection afterwards?

404
00:26:29,301 --> 00:26:35,242
First of all, always remember rejecting you rarely has anything to do with your talent

405
00:26:35,623 --> 00:26:42,664
and of course not your person. Except if you send me emojis like the ones you see up there.

406
00:26:43,464 --> 00:26:47,225
Please don't put yourself on a blacklist because word goes around in the industry.

407
00:26:47,245 --> 00:26:53,707
Usually we're looking for something very specific and between lots and lots of applicants

408
00:26:54,067 --> 00:26:57,468
it's very hard to make a decision but it has to be made.

409
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:06,586
And if you reply, stay friendly, maybe ask for feedback, put yourself out there, apply again.

410
00:27:08,847 --> 00:27:17,794
So now that you know what not to do, here's a short checklist of things to consider before you send out your application.

411
00:27:19,536 --> 00:27:26,261
First of all, what do I apply for? Which position and company are you applying for? Make sure to mention it.

412
00:27:27,804 --> 00:27:34,049
Does the position fit me? And this is always a two-sided thing. Not only does it fit you,

413
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:37,832
do you fit in? Please consider both.

414
00:27:40,234 --> 00:27:45,138
Whom am I addressing? So either you know who your recruiter or HR person is,

415
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:51,684
maybe even check LinkedIn, or just keep it completely neutral. You'll be on the safe side.

416
00:27:53,865 --> 00:27:59,350
What do they want to see? And here we are back again at read the job posting. Usually you can

417
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:06,736
find all required documents in there. A CV, portfolio, references, maybe salary expectation

418
00:28:06,856 --> 00:28:12,601
or the earliest starting date. And those are just some of the possible required informations

419
00:28:12,641 --> 00:28:20,608
that we will ask for. Make sure to hand those in completely. And most of all, don't give up.

420
00:28:22,387 --> 00:28:27,369
Thank you for listening. I hope these tips help you to start your journey into the game industry.

421
00:28:28,369 --> 00:28:34,671
And if you have questions, please throw them in the chat or contact me on Discord or LinkedIn.

422
00:28:34,691 --> 00:28:40,433
And following up, you will hear about Adinda's unconventional dive into this world.

423
00:28:44,778 --> 00:28:50,040
Hello everyone, my name is Adinda, I'm a teacher at the University of Applied Sciences in Groningen

424
00:28:50,401 --> 00:28:55,243
and I also own my own YouTube channel named A-Create where I share different game tutorials

425
00:28:55,343 --> 00:29:00,706
and more information about game development. In my talk I want to share how important it is to

426
00:29:00,786 --> 00:29:02,967
change your own mindset to achieve your goals.

427
00:29:03,747 --> 00:29:08,949
I think it's quite interesting to note that some people told me that they thought that I always had

428
00:29:08,989 --> 00:29:14,650
a great self-esteem and I don't think that's true. I think I just rather did instead of waiting for

429
00:29:14,691 --> 00:29:20,352
the right time. If you are that person that waits for the right time, I'm going to tell you a secret.

430
00:29:20,752 --> 00:29:26,074
It's never the right time to start something new. Our subconscious mind is always creating a lot of

431
00:29:26,234 --> 00:29:31,616
obstacles to let us believe that we are not good enough yet. Next to that we have quite a lot of

432
00:29:31,696 --> 00:29:32,336
blind spots.

433
00:29:33,496 --> 00:29:37,917
which means that we are really bad in judging our own strengths and skills.

434
00:29:38,778 --> 00:29:43,759
I want to inspire with my personal stories all of you to just go for it,

435
00:29:44,259 --> 00:29:48,481
because I believe that you are responsible for your own success.

436
00:29:48,981 --> 00:29:52,702
First, I want to share how I just started with studying game design,

437
00:29:53,182 --> 00:29:56,023
how I find an internship on the other side of the world,

438
00:29:56,463 --> 00:29:59,564
and how I find a job when I was just scrolling on Facebook.

439
00:30:02,362 --> 00:30:08,365
Okay, so it's quite interesting because at secondary school I had the first thought of studying game design.

440
00:30:08,845 --> 00:30:15,329
My friend Brian was already studying it, but I just compared myself to him which was quite bad

441
00:30:15,389 --> 00:30:21,693
because he already made D&D campaigns and a lot of other games and I thought I wasn't as good as him

442
00:30:21,713 --> 00:30:28,517
and my parents weren't that supportive at that time, so I didn't start at that time with studying

443
00:30:28,857 --> 00:30:30,438
instead I studied Chinese.

444
00:30:30,978 --> 00:30:35,861
But in my second year of Chinese, I just realized I really wanted to study game design.

445
00:30:36,161 --> 00:30:43,065
So I went to the Open Day, which was in December, which was a very bad, well, it was quite a bad day

446
00:30:43,145 --> 00:30:46,486
because, well, the trains were late and the venue was almost closed.

447
00:30:47,047 --> 00:30:52,749
but I still went in the building and I just by mere surprise saw Brian sitting there.

448
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:58,372
He was also very surprised and I told him that I was thinking about studying game design

449
00:30:59,012 --> 00:31:03,634
and he told me that he believed that if I just lock myself up and just made a portfolio

450
00:31:03,994 --> 00:31:05,335
I would be able to get in.

451
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,422
And as he told so, he was right.

452
00:31:09,702 --> 00:31:12,744
I got in and I studied game design.

453
00:31:13,345 --> 00:31:16,567
I'm so glad that at that time I saw Brian there,

454
00:31:16,967 --> 00:31:21,250
because most likely I needed a little push to just go for it,

455
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:23,212
to have those little extra guts.

456
00:31:23,672 --> 00:31:26,254
So thanks to Brian, I studied game design.

457
00:31:29,433 --> 00:31:33,214
Okay, so I was studying game design and Chinese at the same time,

458
00:31:33,614 --> 00:31:38,495
so I wanted to combine both studies by doing an internship in Taiwan.

459
00:31:38,515 --> 00:31:43,156
I went to the student coordinator and she, well, she shaked her head.

460
00:31:43,236 --> 00:31:47,537
She said, no, you should go to Japan. I was quite confused because

461
00:31:48,217 --> 00:31:54,119
they're total different countries. And, well, she told me if I really wanted to

462
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:55,579
go, I should just...

463
00:31:56,593 --> 00:32:02,055
do it by myself. So I just applied, I mean I basically write my own emails to

464
00:32:02,155 --> 00:32:07,397
companies in Taiwan and none of them replied me back. So the deadline of the

465
00:32:07,457 --> 00:32:12,819
internship was getting close. So I just thought maybe I should just call them. So

466
00:32:12,879 --> 00:32:17,661
I basically called all the companies in Taiwan that I could find. I was just like

467
00:32:17,741 --> 00:32:22,523
hey hello, I'm Madina, I can speak a bit of Chinese, can you give me a job?

468
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:29,368
I felt quite stupid and basically they thought I was very cute, but most likely I wouldn't get a job out of it.

469
00:32:29,929 --> 00:32:33,954
Luckily there was a very nice lady who asked me for my email address,

470
00:32:34,555 --> 00:32:38,660
but she thought my email address was quite long, so she asked my Skype instead.

471
00:32:39,515 --> 00:32:47,738
And that was like the golden ticket because as he gave her Skype, I could contact her back.

472
00:32:48,198 --> 00:32:52,299
And I basically got a job at her company, which is great.

473
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:57,881
I think in this story, it's very interesting to know that the student coordinator wanted me to do

474
00:32:58,241 --> 00:33:00,822
something that all other people already did.

475
00:33:01,422 --> 00:33:06,743
but I just knew that I really wanted to go to Taiwan and I created the opportunity by myself.

476
00:33:07,344 --> 00:33:13,925
And I think it is really good to sometimes listen to what you really want because you know best.

477
00:33:16,026 --> 00:33:23,307
Okay, so I was just scrolling on Facebook and checking some nice pictures of cats and kittens

478
00:33:24,027 --> 00:33:30,289
and then suddenly there was a job offer which sounded very vague but it was in Hong Kong and

479
00:33:30,329 --> 00:33:31,089
I really like that.

480
00:33:32,132 --> 00:33:35,895
But it just asked for a service learning teacher.

481
00:33:35,915 --> 00:33:37,837
I had no clue what it was.

482
00:33:38,278 --> 00:33:41,701
So the first thing I did was just searching on Google

483
00:33:41,721 --> 00:33:42,662
what service learning.

484
00:33:43,103 --> 00:33:44,945
And I just find out that service learning

485
00:33:45,045 --> 00:33:48,408
is a way of teaching that not only benefits the students,

486
00:33:48,468 --> 00:33:49,890
but also the community.

487
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:50,871
Well, that.

488
00:33:51,854 --> 00:33:57,336
made me think because like quite a lot of games have the same purpose, especially applied games.

489
00:33:57,796 --> 00:34:05,319
So I looked at all the games that I worked on during my studies and I just, we made a total

490
00:34:05,459 --> 00:34:15,643
other portfolio, like a different CV and I made a total different portfolio.

491
00:34:17,202 --> 00:34:24,390
focused on service learning and I succeeded in that because most likely they liked that I really

492
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:30,997
focused on it and I got the job and I think it was the best job I ever had because I made

493
00:34:31,698 --> 00:34:34,561
design my own courses and teach them as well.

494
00:34:35,922 --> 00:34:43,371
So in this story, it's interesting to know that I thought that the job offer was really strange,

495
00:34:43,451 --> 00:34:46,735
but still too good to be true. Well, sometimes...

496
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:54,843
It is too good to be true, so sometimes you should just be a little bit curious to just go for it.

497
00:34:55,463 --> 00:35:02,086
Well, that's my motto. And also, if you think that you can't find a job or opportunities in

498
00:35:02,146 --> 00:35:07,709
your home country, just believe me, it is so easy to go to the other side of the world.

499
00:35:08,269 --> 00:35:12,871
Well, not now, but later on it will be easy again. So please don't forget that.

500
00:35:13,752 --> 00:35:19,702
I hope my personal stories inspired you to just change your own mindset and just go for it.

501
00:35:20,944 --> 00:35:26,012
Next up is Jonas who's going to explain how to apply for a job. See ya!

502
00:35:26,596 --> 00:35:32,801
Hey everybody, my name is Jonas Pastors and I'm a junior game designer and junior narrative designer at Gaming Mind Studios.

503
00:35:33,122 --> 00:35:38,727
In my section of the Schmalky Talk, I'm going to go through the application process from the perspective of someone looking for a job

504
00:35:39,107 --> 00:35:45,012
and I'm going to give you general tips, tricks and insights that I learned while looking for my first full-time position myself.

505
00:35:45,733 --> 00:35:47,835
Now, to start off with a quick word about my profile.

506
00:35:48,756 --> 00:35:53,300
I was looking for a job between June and September 2020, right after I'd got my master's degree.

507
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:58,282
At the time, I had about 10 months of experience within internships and general side hustles,

508
00:35:58,702 --> 00:36:03,025
and I consider my expertise being within NPC design, and I naturally wanted to find a job

509
00:36:03,065 --> 00:36:07,947
to reflect that. Now, to find opportunities to apply to, I mainly went through my network.

510
00:36:08,348 --> 00:36:11,989
I'd created it over the course of my studies, going to conferences, talking to people,

511
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:16,792
connecting with them, and now I was able to regularly check Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter,

512
00:36:17,192 --> 00:36:19,133
anywhere where they would share relevant positions.

513
00:36:21,333 --> 00:36:26,977
Another thing I did was to go through lists of companies in the general area I was looking for a job in, being Western Europe.

514
00:36:27,357 --> 00:36:31,221
And what this allowed me to do was to find plenty of companies I'd never heard of before,

515
00:36:31,961 --> 00:36:34,563
but who were still looking to fill relevant positions to me.

516
00:36:35,104 --> 00:36:37,786
Fun fact, I ended up finding my job via this method.

517
00:36:38,727 --> 00:36:41,048
A great resource I can recommend is GameDevMap,

518
00:36:41,669 --> 00:36:47,454
which is a great repository of information about companies, their locations, and generally what they do,

519
00:36:47,854 --> 00:36:50,196
which is really great if you're looking for something specific.

520
00:36:51,201 --> 00:36:54,723
A third way to generate opportunities for me was to get my profile out there.

521
00:36:55,543 --> 00:36:59,306
If you've been studying for a while and if you've been preparing to go into the industry,

522
00:36:59,586 --> 00:37:02,408
it's likely that you have one or two cool projects under your belt.

523
00:37:02,548 --> 00:37:06,871
What I can recommend is to get them out there, put them on sites like itch.io, present them

524
00:37:06,931 --> 00:37:11,474
on your portfolio, anything to get your profile out there and maybe get discovered by a recruiter.

525
00:37:12,475 --> 00:37:18,176
The way I went about this was to write a Gamasutra article based on the research I did for my master's thesis.

526
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:25,618
The article ended up getting featured and what happened was that two companies approached me to inquire whether I would be a good fit for them.

527
00:37:27,218 --> 00:37:34,900
And even though there was only two opportunities of the 30 applications I wrote, I still consider them to be the most valuable because they approached me.

528
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:37,840
I didn't have to convince them that I knew what I was talking about.

529
00:37:38,863 --> 00:37:42,925
Still, I ended up writing about 30, 31 applications.

530
00:37:43,365 --> 00:37:49,149
And what you will find after the first couple, that there's a lot of information to keep

531
00:37:49,189 --> 00:37:49,549
track of.

532
00:37:49,889 --> 00:37:53,451
So what I found, it is really important to keep organized.

533
00:37:53,851 --> 00:37:58,534
And I did that in a way by keeping this handy little table with the company name, with the

534
00:37:58,574 --> 00:38:04,197
position, with a link to the position so I could check back later, and the general status

535
00:38:04,317 --> 00:38:05,078
of the application.

536
00:38:07,306 --> 00:38:11,848
And what was especially valuable I found was this last contact column on the right,

537
00:38:11,908 --> 00:38:14,790
because sometimes companies will take a little while to respond to you.

538
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:21,453
And it's always good to know when they wrote last, so you know whether you can inquire without being too pushy.

539
00:38:22,273 --> 00:38:27,016
What you might also notice is that I applied to a wide range of different positions.

540
00:38:27,496 --> 00:38:30,697
World designer, UX designer, game designer, narrative designer.

541
00:38:31,418 --> 00:38:35,200
And I had to do that because there were very few positions.

542
00:38:35,919 --> 00:38:42,222
that seemed tailor-made for what I could do, so I had to be flexible. Flexible in what I was looking

543
00:38:42,262 --> 00:38:48,486
for, flexible in what I wanted to do, and I was able to do this because during my studies and

544
00:38:48,566 --> 00:38:57,011
generally when looking at games, I didn't just stick to the field I wanted to work in. When I

545
00:38:57,352 --> 00:39:03,215
wanted to do my internship, I wanted to do narrative. The company that I ended up working with

546
00:39:03,934 --> 00:39:10,757
needed game design, so I did game design for them. And now when I was looking for a full-time position,

547
00:39:10,857 --> 00:39:15,399
I wanted to do game design. The company I am with now asked me if I can do narrative,

548
00:39:15,699 --> 00:39:23,382
and I said, yeah, sure. So while you're studying, keep your eyes open for different things adjacent

549
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:28,244
to what you are interested in and what you're doing right now. Be curious. You might never know

550
00:39:28,724 --> 00:39:32,565
what skill set you acquire at the site will get you a job in the end.

551
00:39:33,418 --> 00:39:39,141
Now, if you've written enough applications, eventually you will be doing an interview.

552
00:39:40,622 --> 00:39:47,365
And what I found worked really good for me was to be engaging, smile a lot, consider it a

553
00:39:48,206 --> 00:39:52,788
nice conversation with a partner, not with someone who has your life in their hands.

554
00:39:53,468 --> 00:39:58,591
You've written enough applications, you will get other interviews with other companies.

555
00:39:58,631 --> 00:39:59,531
So don't stress about it.

556
00:40:00,324 --> 00:40:04,047
Be pleasant to talk to and this already goes a long way.

557
00:40:05,348 --> 00:40:07,029
However, be prepared for tough questions.

558
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:10,211
Beforehand, consider your own profile,

559
00:40:10,231 --> 00:40:13,934
try to make out weaknesses and try

560
00:40:13,954 --> 00:40:16,275
to come up with answers for tough questions.

561
00:40:16,556 --> 00:40:18,337
Say, if there's a gap in your CV,

562
00:40:19,218 --> 00:40:20,679
think about what you might answer.

563
00:40:21,179 --> 00:40:23,501
What's also important is that you have your own questions

564
00:40:23,561 --> 00:40:23,901
prepared.

565
00:40:25,313 --> 00:40:26,093
Ideally, you have a list.

566
00:40:26,113 --> 00:40:31,597
You don't need to ask all of them, but what that shows is that you have taken the time

567
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:36,480
to prepare for the interview and that you have taken the time to take an interest in

568
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,981
the company, and this also goes a long way.

569
00:40:39,622 --> 00:40:45,745
Now, what usually followed an interview for me was a design test, and they were usually

570
00:40:45,785 --> 00:40:47,627
between two and 10 days in duration.

571
00:40:47,767 --> 00:40:52,429
What you see on the right is a two-day design test where I had to create some logic in Unreal

572
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:52,710
Engine.

573
00:40:53,537 --> 00:40:57,918
And what's really important here is that you take the necessary time to complete them,

574
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:05,821
because the companies are looking for how you do with limited time and limited instructions.

575
00:41:07,001 --> 00:41:11,402
And what's totally cool to do is to ask to postpone it if you don't have the time to

576
00:41:12,462 --> 00:41:16,844
do that right now. The design test on the right I got on a workday, it was during a conference,

577
00:41:17,024 --> 00:41:20,225
I did not have the time to complete it. So I asked them.

578
00:41:20,973 --> 00:41:22,834
hey, is it cool if I do it during the weekend?

579
00:41:22,874 --> 00:41:24,215
They were like, sure, why not?

580
00:41:24,375 --> 00:41:25,956
They hadn't given me the information

581
00:41:28,058 --> 00:41:30,380
that I needed to complete it, so that was totally cool.

582
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,722
I did the design test, and I ended up getting an offer.

583
00:41:34,923 --> 00:41:38,225
So definitely take the time, and if it's not a good time for you,

584
00:41:38,986 --> 00:41:39,726
try to postpone it.

585
00:41:40,747 --> 00:41:43,769
Now, ideally, after a design test, you will get an offer.

586
00:41:44,109 --> 00:41:44,750
You may take it.

587
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:46,191
You may keep searching.

588
00:41:46,991 --> 00:41:49,613
But ideally, you will have a job at the end.

589
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:55,753
I hope these tips are useful to you and I hope to see you in the Q&A section.

590
00:41:56,654 --> 00:41:59,976
Hi, I'm Klaus. I've worked as a storyboard artist on games like Hitman,

591
00:42:00,156 --> 00:42:05,200
Risen of Rome and Horizon Forbidden West. In this presentation, I want to talk with you about

592
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:10,923
creating opportunities. I have six tips for you that are especially important if you're starting

593
00:42:10,963 --> 00:42:17,148
your job hunt but you don't have a network yet. And then I have this one anecdote from my own

594
00:42:17,228 --> 00:42:19,209
career where I did everything wrong.

595
00:42:19,934 --> 00:42:24,617
But before we dive into that, a quick word on opportunities in general.

596
00:42:25,298 --> 00:42:30,301
They are everywhere, even beyond all these well-known international conferences

597
00:42:30,341 --> 00:42:31,122
we like to attend.

598
00:42:31,142 --> 00:42:35,605
It could be a career day at your university with a panel discussion on stage.

599
00:42:35,685 --> 00:42:39,507
It could be a social event that is industry related, like a life drawing class

600
00:42:40,228 --> 00:42:42,750
or a workshop where industry professionals are present.

601
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:45,011
All these can improve your reach.

602
00:42:45,712 --> 00:42:46,192
Secondly.

603
00:42:46,968 --> 00:42:50,490
Remember, 100% of all jobs are given to you by humans.

604
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:53,931
Therefore, the more relevant people you know, the better.

605
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:58,853
Now, for some people, meeting others means a lot of stress, and we don't need that.

606
00:42:59,454 --> 00:43:00,794
This brings me to my first tip.

607
00:43:01,835 --> 00:43:03,355
Think it's not going to happen today.

608
00:43:04,336 --> 00:43:07,758
Odds are, you will not sign a contract right there at the conference,

609
00:43:08,238 --> 00:43:11,879
especially not at your very first portfolio review ever.

610
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,680
Therefore, relax.

611
00:43:14,974 --> 00:43:18,717
The worst thing that can happen to you is that you get no job and you don't have a good time.

612
00:43:19,157 --> 00:43:20,858
So please try to enjoy yourself.

613
00:43:21,579 --> 00:43:26,182
You will be more approachable this way too for others who also seek those new connections.

614
00:43:26,743 --> 00:43:29,385
Really, we are all there to network after all.

615
00:43:30,185 --> 00:43:31,586
So what do I want to aim for?

616
00:43:32,047 --> 00:43:32,407
My tip?

617
00:43:33,182 --> 00:43:34,163
Go for the silver medal.

618
00:43:35,043 --> 00:43:36,944
Imagine the decision is already made,

619
00:43:37,524 --> 00:43:39,966
because unless you're a genius newcomer,

620
00:43:40,266 --> 00:43:44,108
you will not get the first most awesome open position or gig.

621
00:43:44,828 --> 00:43:47,829
Instead, aim at the second job the producer or editor

622
00:43:47,869 --> 00:43:48,450
needs to fill.

623
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:50,891
But Klaus, how do I get in line for that?

624
00:43:51,451 --> 00:43:53,512
By building a network of peers.

625
00:43:54,272 --> 00:43:57,114
So seek business partners, not clients.

626
00:43:58,039 --> 00:44:00,962
Your peers and colleagues are the most important part of your network.

627
00:44:01,382 --> 00:44:03,424
It's not only about potential clients.

628
00:44:04,364 --> 00:44:06,966
Use any opportunity to connect with your peers.

629
00:44:07,147 --> 00:44:09,709
For example, while waiting in line for that job interview.

630
00:44:10,429 --> 00:44:13,192
Ask them how they got into the industry and look at their portfolios.

631
00:44:13,952 --> 00:44:17,715
If the vibe is right, see if you can get a group together for dinner.

632
00:44:18,256 --> 00:44:21,358
It might even be fun because in the end we're all nerds, right?

633
00:44:22,639 --> 00:44:23,840
They are not your competition.

634
00:44:25,443 --> 00:44:28,264
And these people can become your friends or allies.

635
00:44:28,924 --> 00:44:30,565
Companies give away jobs.

636
00:44:31,045 --> 00:44:32,385
Nobody can steal them from you.

637
00:44:33,146 --> 00:44:35,927
If they get the job you wanted, they were just a better fit.

638
00:44:36,687 --> 00:44:40,188
And you all of a sudden have a colleague or friend at your dream company.

639
00:44:40,848 --> 00:44:43,629
So when the time comes that this company has more jobs to give away,

640
00:44:44,209 --> 00:44:45,310
who do you think gets the call?

641
00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:47,050
They call the silver medal guy.

642
00:44:48,131 --> 00:44:52,072
This is how I got my first geek drawing Transformers comics for IDW back in the day.

643
00:44:52,913 --> 00:44:53,433
True story.

644
00:44:55,029 --> 00:44:57,772
Point number four, be a force for good at the conference.

645
00:44:57,992 --> 00:44:59,013
Be present.

646
00:44:59,654 --> 00:45:00,755
Interact at a panel.

647
00:45:01,015 --> 00:45:05,199
Sit first row, take notes, make eye contact, ask a question.

648
00:45:06,214 --> 00:45:08,556
Always good, help somebody that is under stress,

649
00:45:08,996 --> 00:45:10,638
which is a common thing at a conference.

650
00:45:11,118 --> 00:45:11,798
Hold the door.

651
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:13,980
If they look lost, help them to their meeting room.

652
00:45:14,541 --> 00:45:16,462
Lend somebody a pen or an aspirin.

653
00:45:17,122 --> 00:45:17,723
Be giving.

654
00:45:18,403 --> 00:45:19,484
Just don't be obtrusive

655
00:45:19,945 --> 00:45:21,726
and don't expect anything back right there.

656
00:45:22,266 --> 00:45:24,128
This way, the second time you bump into each other,

657
00:45:24,368 --> 00:45:26,490
maybe a year later at the next conference,

658
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:28,571
they will remember you fondly

659
00:45:29,072 --> 00:45:30,473
and that's where things get moving.

660
00:45:31,093 --> 00:45:32,234
So when you made it this far,

661
00:45:32,434 --> 00:45:34,276
especially with potential clients,

662
00:45:35,388 --> 00:45:36,368
Get their business card.

663
00:45:37,029 --> 00:45:38,749
Again, get their business card.

664
00:45:39,410 --> 00:45:41,951
Don't worry about getting your card into their hands.

665
00:45:42,491 --> 00:45:45,313
Assume that you will need to be able to reach them,

666
00:45:45,333 --> 00:45:46,653
not vice versa.

667
00:45:47,274 --> 00:45:49,955
Bonus tip, scribble notes directly on their card

668
00:45:50,095 --> 00:45:50,675
after the meeting.

669
00:45:51,075 --> 00:45:53,837
Stuff like location, occasion, talking points,

670
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:57,078
because when you contact them after the conference,

671
00:45:57,599 --> 00:45:59,500
you want to remind them how they know you.

672
00:46:00,409 --> 00:46:04,353
Anything can be important if you want to recreate the moment you met them in their minds.

673
00:46:04,854 --> 00:46:06,916
And that brings me to my most important point today.

674
00:46:08,357 --> 00:46:13,863
Everybody counts. I know everybody wants to get a minute with a big CEO or this superstar artist

675
00:46:14,003 --> 00:46:19,508
after the panel on stage. Please look beyond that one opportunity. Talk with other people

676
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:23,292
in the line. They could be your future colleagues who might refer jobs to you.

677
00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:28,932
talk with the VIP's friend or spouse right next to them or their personal assistant

678
00:46:30,012 --> 00:46:36,195
or volunteer convention organizer because first it's just totally impolite to ignore them and

679
00:46:36,275 --> 00:46:40,597
second they might have more industry insights and connections than you can see at first glance.

680
00:46:41,357 --> 00:46:45,899
They will appreciate being seen and they will have a very good reason for being there just as you do.

681
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:52,082
Literally everybody can be important. And this last advice brings me to my unfortunate

682
00:46:53,022 --> 00:46:58,626
anecdote where I did everything wrong. It was in 2001. I was in America for the first time

683
00:46:58,647 --> 00:47:04,471
and I attended San Diego Comic Con in California. I was already published in Germany and had what I

684
00:47:04,551 --> 00:47:10,475
thought was a high standard for comics. I wasn't into serious action comics, realistically drawn

685
00:47:10,515 --> 00:47:16,140
with high-end computer coloring. So I was walking by a not very exciting looking booth which was

686
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:22,204
manned by someone who looked like your typical tall beardy comic book guy. Pretty unassuming.

687
00:47:23,097 --> 00:47:26,298
and he tried to sell me his comic. It was called Battle Pope.

688
00:47:27,278 --> 00:47:32,221
It was in black and white, tongue in cheek and definitely not high-end superheroes.

689
00:47:32,941 --> 00:47:34,301
I wasn't impressed by the book.

690
00:47:35,002 --> 00:47:37,863
I dismissed the publishing effort and him, the guy who wrote the book,

691
00:47:38,423 --> 00:47:40,944
and I indeed didn't ask for his business card.

692
00:47:41,865 --> 00:47:44,526
I still bought an issue of his books out of courtesy

693
00:47:45,066 --> 00:47:48,427
and found it surprisingly entertaining when I read it on the flight back to Germany.

694
00:47:48,447 --> 00:47:50,368
I never saw the guy again.

695
00:47:51,744 --> 00:47:57,367
Later on, it turns out, he did another black and white independent comic, which was a bit of a success.

696
00:47:57,948 --> 00:48:00,890
It was called The Walking Dead. You might have heard about it.

697
00:48:01,450 --> 00:48:05,712
And then he also did a superhero comic, even in color, it's called Invincible,

698
00:48:05,752 --> 00:48:08,814
which is now streaming as an animated series on Amazon Prime.

699
00:48:10,335 --> 00:48:13,957
Yes, I completely ignored the legendary writer and creator Robert Kirkman.

700
00:48:15,758 --> 00:48:17,659
So please be nice to everybody, because...

701
00:48:18,513 --> 00:48:22,256
Everybody can be an important contact in your future career network.

702
00:48:22,876 --> 00:48:25,859
With a bit of luck, I will see you at our next business opportunity.

703
00:48:26,419 --> 00:48:27,120
Thanks for listening.
