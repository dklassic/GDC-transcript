1
00:00:05,432 --> 00:00:07,880
All right, I'll get started while we wait for Chris to pop in here real quick.

2
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,148
Before we start anything, I just want to show you this picture.

3
00:00:11,649 --> 00:00:16,252
Last year we opened up a center at the New Orleans Children's Hospital, the Rehabilitation

4
00:00:16,292 --> 00:00:21,255
Hospital, New Orleans Children's Hospital, and we had a game day.

5
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:26,479
And this is one of my favorite pictures that came out of that game day because this young

6
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:31,142
man had not been gaming for really ever because of his disability.

7
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:37,826
And we had the Microsoft Xbox adaptive controller and a couple of switches, and he was gaming

8
00:00:37,846 --> 00:00:38,647
for the first time.

9
00:00:39,467 --> 00:00:43,469
I really just love this picture because I'm just so happy and the kid is so happy and

10
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:46,270
I'm also wearing the exact same shirt as I am in this picture.

11
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:49,572
You've watched it since, right?

12
00:00:49,592 --> 00:00:50,292
I didn't say that.

13
00:00:52,962 --> 00:00:57,283
After that splendid introduction, I'm Chris Power, I'm the vice president of AbleGamers.

14
00:00:57,423 --> 00:01:00,303
I'm supposed to walk this way, so I will walk this way.

15
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:04,584
They told us we can't go from that chair to that chair, but neither of us wanted to sit down.

16
00:01:04,844 --> 00:01:05,344
That's right.

17
00:01:06,085 --> 00:01:08,765
So I lead the games user research side of AbleGamers.

18
00:01:08,845 --> 00:01:10,786
I joined the organization about three years ago.

19
00:01:10,806 --> 00:01:14,807
I have about 15 years of experience in user experience and inclusive design.

20
00:01:15,487 --> 00:01:20,148
And I work with a team, specifically Greg Haines and a team at the University of York,

21
00:01:20,488 --> 00:01:22,448
where I have a day job as an associate professor.

22
00:01:23,789 --> 00:01:30,050
And my name is Mark Barley. I'm the founder of AbleGamers. This is my sixth GDC that I've done.

23
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:35,731
I've also been privileged to present at the White House under the Obama administration in more places than I can even count.

24
00:01:37,151 --> 00:01:42,032
I will say because my friend Linda's here, when I started AbleGamers 15 years ago this year,

25
00:01:42,592 --> 00:01:46,973
I actually converted an EverQuest 2 fan site to the very first AbleGamers site.

26
00:01:49,408 --> 00:01:52,210
None of this would really be possible without this great team.

27
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:57,353
So we have Jen Beeston, who's a research fellow with AbleGamers and a PhD student at the University

28
00:01:57,393 --> 00:01:57,774
of York.

29
00:01:58,234 --> 00:02:02,517
Paul Cairns, who is our scholar in residence and a colleague of mine, a reader at the University

30
00:02:02,537 --> 00:02:02,877
of York.

31
00:02:03,398 --> 00:02:08,061
Greg Haynes is our lead user researcher, who has contributed to the APX material you're

32
00:02:08,081 --> 00:02:08,902
going to see today.

33
00:02:09,642 --> 00:02:15,346
As well as Craig Kaufman and Steve Spahn and Jesse and Kelso, who are members of our team

34
00:02:15,386 --> 00:02:16,667
at our headquarters in West Virginia.

35
00:02:16,767 --> 00:02:18,728
But we asked them for pictures and they forgot to send them.

36
00:02:22,435 --> 00:02:25,076
So when we talk about players with disabilities playing games,

37
00:02:25,136 --> 00:02:27,677
we often think about putting information into the game

38
00:02:27,697 --> 00:02:28,698
and getting information out.

39
00:02:28,818 --> 00:02:31,039
We often talk about flexible presentation

40
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:32,039
and flexible controls.

41
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:33,640
And we will talk about that today.

42
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,761
But when we boil accessibility down to something like that,

43
00:02:37,081 --> 00:02:39,282
it's often the case that it oversimplifies it.

44
00:02:39,602 --> 00:02:42,263
Because games aren't like other interactive technologies.

45
00:02:42,303 --> 00:02:44,364
When we talk about accessibility in other areas,

46
00:02:44,384 --> 00:02:46,225
there's always a task that we're trying to complete.

47
00:02:46,665 --> 00:02:49,126
Something like, I'm going to get my money from a bank machine,

48
00:02:49,366 --> 00:02:51,207
or I'm going to pay my taxes on a website.

49
00:02:51,707 --> 00:02:55,970
Games aren't like that. Games are a lot more than just putting information in and getting them out.

50
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:58,972
They're about playing a game, and what does that really mean?

51
00:02:59,652 --> 00:03:03,134
What it largely means is that players are going out seeking an experience.

52
00:03:03,855 --> 00:03:07,717
We know that with game designers and with anyone who works with players,

53
00:03:08,057 --> 00:03:12,940
that they're always talking about the player experience as being the core thing that we're worried about.

54
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,301
The fact that someone can move a character doesn't mean that they're playing the game.

55
00:03:17,701 --> 00:03:23,343
Just because I can explore the universe as Ryder walking around in Andromeda, for example,

56
00:03:23,663 --> 00:03:28,584
it doesn't necessarily mean that I'm having fun or that I'm experiencing the game the way that I want to.

57
00:03:29,264 --> 00:03:35,705
When we talk about experiences with players with disabilities, we've taken to describing them as accessible player experiences,

58
00:03:36,085 --> 00:03:39,706
by which we mean a player is having the experience that they want to have in a game,

59
00:03:40,146 --> 00:03:43,347
free from barriers that are as a result of their disability.

60
00:03:44,976 --> 00:03:45,540
Slow down.

61
00:03:45,902 --> 00:03:46,908
I will slow down.

62
00:03:49,116 --> 00:03:53,639
So when we start talking about potential players with disabilities, what are we talking about

63
00:03:53,679 --> 00:03:57,481
in terms of an audience? Because people often ask us, well, how many players are we really

64
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:03,424
talking about? When we look at different statistics around the world, we found various data from

65
00:04:03,464 --> 00:04:08,788
about 2011. The most recent data that we were able to find was in the U.S. census, where

66
00:04:08,808 --> 00:04:15,312
it talked about approximately 13% of the population in the U.S. having a disability. Now, that

67
00:04:15,632 --> 00:04:19,376
That is a particular classification that's been used for quite a long time in the census.

68
00:04:19,856 --> 00:04:24,501
When you look at new data, the newest data that we have is the Canadian Disability Survey,

69
00:04:25,302 --> 00:04:27,445
not because it's my home nation, but simply because it's...

70
00:04:27,485 --> 00:04:28,306
Wait, you're Canadian?

71
00:04:28,546 --> 00:04:29,167
Wait, really?

72
00:04:29,187 --> 00:04:32,390
Hey, there we go.

73
00:04:33,855 --> 00:04:35,796
So in the Canadian Disability Survey,

74
00:04:35,856 --> 00:04:39,177
there's a much broader definition of what a disability is.

75
00:04:39,597 --> 00:04:41,718
And there you find definitions related to things

76
00:04:41,758 --> 00:04:43,579
like dexterity or flexibility,

77
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:46,220
or things related to age-related disabilities,

78
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,001
but also things around mental health, for example,

79
00:04:49,281 --> 00:04:51,722
which are now reaching into the broader classification

80
00:04:51,762 --> 00:04:53,403
and things that we'll talk about today

81
00:04:53,803 --> 00:04:56,224
as part of our user research.

82
00:04:56,764 --> 00:04:59,265
As a result, the estimate that we put is somewhere between-

83
00:04:59,285 --> 00:05:00,886
So what that means, this is my part.

84
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,160
No, no, I was just going to give the final percentage.

85
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,580
Somewhere between 13% and 22%.

86
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:10,641
So what that really means is that if you look at this

87
00:05:10,861 --> 00:05:14,062
information from the ESA, so the ESA says about 64% of

88
00:05:14,162 --> 00:05:16,722
people have access to gaming equipment in

89
00:05:16,762 --> 00:05:17,783
their home right now.

90
00:05:18,263 --> 00:05:22,063
That means that there are 27 to 45 million people with

91
00:05:22,103 --> 00:05:26,624
disabilities in the US that have the equipment that they

92
00:05:26,684 --> 00:05:27,524
need to play.

93
00:05:28,265 --> 00:05:29,045
Are they playing?

94
00:05:30,815 --> 00:05:35,198
Well, it turns out that actually a large number of players with disabilities in the game now.

95
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:39,802
This doesn't mean that every player with disabilities, of course, is out there playing, but it's

96
00:05:39,822 --> 00:05:42,324
certainly much larger than people typically think.

97
00:05:42,964 --> 00:05:48,668
We've been reaching out to the global population to try to build out a player panel, a group

98
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:51,790
of players who can participate in game testing and user research.

99
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:57,014
We have a large number of players from North America, from Europe, and across the world.

100
00:05:57,354 --> 00:06:00,315
who want to participate in your game research.

101
00:06:00,775 --> 00:06:03,576
We offer this as a service through AbleGamers free of charge,

102
00:06:03,876 --> 00:06:07,598
where we can pair you with individuals who meet various characteristics,

103
00:06:07,718 --> 00:06:10,399
either in terms of who they are or what they play.

104
00:06:11,179 --> 00:06:15,721
We currently have somewhere between 400 and 450 people that are active in the panel,

105
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,002
and the data that I'm going to talk about today is just about 400.

106
00:06:19,622 --> 00:06:24,224
The groups of people with disabilities, we ask them to complete a demographic questionnaire.

107
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,762
And when we look at that demographic questionnaire, we find that we have about 50% of people who

108
00:06:29,842 --> 00:06:33,445
have some sort of physical disability in either their upper limb or their lower limbs.

109
00:06:33,965 --> 00:06:37,407
We also have a large number of people with sensory disabilities, which are the traditional

110
00:06:37,447 --> 00:06:42,270
sensory disabilities that we think about in terms of hearing and seeing, and people with

111
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:45,592
color vision deficiencies, so people who have alternate ways of seeing color.

112
00:06:46,253 --> 00:06:50,059
And we also have a large number of people who process information differently, where

113
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:54,045
we have people with mental health difficulties, for example, people with learning disabilities,

114
00:06:54,365 --> 00:06:57,270
people with cognitive disabilities, or broader neurodiversity.

115
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:00,535
So people with autism or people with high-functioning autism.

116
00:07:01,436 --> 00:07:07,065
The really interesting thing is we often classify people in accessibility circles by their disability.

117
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:12,974
When you look at a lot of the materials online, we often talk about people in silos or in categories.

118
00:07:13,294 --> 00:07:16,079
People are either blind or they have low vision.

119
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,801
What we found was largely across our disability population,

120
00:07:21,221 --> 00:07:24,221
most people did not identify as having a single disability.

121
00:07:24,622 --> 00:07:27,162
Now, this has important implications for our design,

122
00:07:27,462 --> 00:07:30,543
because one of the most common things we hear from designers

123
00:07:30,663 --> 00:07:32,343
is, I don't want to choose.

124
00:07:32,843 --> 00:07:35,584
I don't want to have to choose between one group of players

125
00:07:35,624 --> 00:07:36,164
and another.

126
00:07:36,524 --> 00:07:37,785
And what we've been working towards

127
00:07:37,865 --> 00:07:40,865
is a broader understanding of what options people use,

128
00:07:41,205 --> 00:07:43,146
and in particular, the surprising result

129
00:07:43,446 --> 00:07:45,426
that people overlap in the types of things

130
00:07:45,446 --> 00:07:46,507
that they want and need.

131
00:07:47,227 --> 00:07:50,009
So as part of player panels, we ask a large demographic survey,

132
00:07:50,029 --> 00:07:53,732
which includes information about the technology that they use to access games.

133
00:07:54,693 --> 00:07:58,977
We have about 46% of players at the moment who use key remapping.

134
00:07:59,017 --> 00:08:02,419
Now the numbers I'm giving you, they've actually remained really stable.

135
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,442
So we've been collecting data for about two years now,

136
00:08:05,922 --> 00:08:08,524
and after the initial tranche of players joined,

137
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,946
we ended up finding that our numbers have settled down,

138
00:08:10,966 --> 00:08:13,088
so we believe that these are fairly representative

139
00:08:13,148 --> 00:08:15,890
of the current population of players who are playing games.

140
00:08:16,611 --> 00:08:22,812
Now, we had about 10% of those players who do not have physical disabilities who are

141
00:08:22,932 --> 00:08:24,033
using key remapping.

142
00:08:24,453 --> 00:08:28,954
So it gives you an idea that some people are co-opting these things in order to play games

143
00:08:29,094 --> 00:08:29,994
in a different way.

144
00:08:30,634 --> 00:08:35,275
It becomes even more stark when we look at subtitles and captioning, where we only have

145
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:39,896
about 14% of players in the panels who have either low hearing or sign language using

146
00:08:39,956 --> 00:08:40,536
deaf people.

147
00:08:40,977 --> 00:08:43,497
Over 40% of our players use subtitling.

148
00:08:44,077 --> 00:08:45,998
This shows that this is a key piece of...

149
00:08:46,718 --> 00:08:54,262
Technology that's allowing people to customize their experience either related to their disability or simply because they want to tune their game.

150
00:08:54,342 --> 00:09:01,926
Yeah, the data literally said that, you know, for example, people with cognitive disabilities, people that are learning English as a second language,

151
00:09:02,407 --> 00:09:10,591
women turn on subtitling more than men. And so when you hear that statement, well, subtitling are for people who can't hear.

152
00:09:11,211 --> 00:09:15,374
Our data showed that that's not true, that subtitling is for people that need subtitling.

153
00:09:16,288 --> 00:09:20,091
We also find this in things like recoloring, where people want to distinguish one piece

154
00:09:20,131 --> 00:09:21,392
of information from another.

155
00:09:21,793 --> 00:09:26,116
We often link this to people with color vision deficiencies, so people who are color blind

156
00:09:26,496 --> 00:09:28,158
or have alternate ways of seeing color.

157
00:09:28,798 --> 00:09:33,281
However, we only have about 4% of people in the panels who actually identify as having

158
00:09:33,321 --> 00:09:37,044
that, and 20% of people are turning on recoloring options.

159
00:09:37,585 --> 00:09:39,286
When I mentioned this at another conference,

160
00:09:39,306 --> 00:09:41,928
when I presented that number, someone came up to me and said,

161
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:43,149
I know why they're doing that.

162
00:09:43,309 --> 00:09:44,470
And I got really excited, because I

163
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:45,311
thought they were going to tell me.

164
00:09:45,571 --> 00:09:46,191
And they did.

165
00:09:46,412 --> 00:09:47,853
They were like, it's because in Fortnite,

166
00:09:47,873 --> 00:09:48,893
you can see enemies better.

167
00:09:50,194 --> 00:09:52,716
And I went, oh, it's absolutely true.

168
00:09:52,776 --> 00:09:53,597
That's really cool.

169
00:09:53,917 --> 00:09:55,158
And actually, when we talk to people,

170
00:09:55,418 --> 00:09:58,481
people are co-opting these things for broader aspects

171
00:09:58,521 --> 00:09:59,221
of game play.

172
00:09:59,622 --> 00:10:01,543
So when you think about accessibility options,

173
00:10:01,603 --> 00:10:03,765
it's actually not just about disability.

174
00:10:04,025 --> 00:10:06,607
It's about a broader part of your design in games.

175
00:10:06,947 --> 00:10:12,334
Microsoft's own research actually says that 80% of people who use Windows and Office suites

176
00:10:12,895 --> 00:10:17,220
use an accessibility feature, a feature that they specifically put in for accessibility

177
00:10:17,581 --> 00:10:19,403
in order to make their work better. 80%.

178
00:10:21,807 --> 00:10:25,548
So we asked people a bit of information about their flexibility of control.

179
00:10:25,648 --> 00:10:29,190
How do they modify different pieces of input into the game?

180
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:33,592
And there we found a wide variety of different types of controllers being used.

181
00:10:33,932 --> 00:10:37,413
People typically talked about when they used a customized controller,

182
00:10:37,774 --> 00:10:42,436
something like a customized mouse or a custom controller that's been built for them.

183
00:10:42,796 --> 00:10:46,978
And also things like alternate controllers like the quad stick, where you have a sip and puff interface.

184
00:10:47,538 --> 00:10:51,522
However, tied to that, you'll also see that key remapping becomes an important part of

185
00:10:51,582 --> 00:10:52,123
gameplay.

186
00:10:52,603 --> 00:10:56,527
Whenever we use one of these things, it's important, these types of alternative inputs,

187
00:10:56,907 --> 00:11:01,472
key remapping recurs again and again with it as something that's necessary to be able

188
00:11:01,512 --> 00:11:06,757
to change the controls from that standard controller over to the new one that's coming

189
00:11:06,898 --> 00:11:06,958
in.

190
00:11:07,859 --> 00:11:12,161
We also talked to people about how they flexibly changed the presentation in their games.

191
00:11:12,661 --> 00:11:16,743
We had, of course, many people talking about captions, but we also found people talking

192
00:11:16,783 --> 00:11:21,325
about text enlargement, changing the contrast of different aspects, including text.

193
00:11:21,745 --> 00:11:25,907
We had people talk about the importance of alternative alerts, so vibrations, for example,

194
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:31,150
or having sound alerts that go along with visual, or in some cases, having visual alerts

195
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:34,251
that tell you about events that are happening in the environment when the sound is off.

196
00:11:34,712 --> 00:11:38,415
One of the most famous ones that we'll talk about later is the sound ring in Fortnite

197
00:11:38,736 --> 00:11:43,741
that's typically used on mobile but now has been transferred over to desktop and a console

198
00:11:44,181 --> 00:11:48,825
as an important part of the design that was for people who necessarily didn't have the sound on.

199
00:11:49,266 --> 00:11:52,169
Either because they were on a train, or because they were playing late at night,

200
00:11:52,429 --> 00:11:55,572
or because they were my kids trying to hide the fact that they were playing games.

201
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:04,443
So more importantly, though, we had the opportunity to talk to our players about how they value

202
00:12:04,483 --> 00:12:04,863
gaming.

203
00:12:05,283 --> 00:12:09,766
There's very little information in the gaming space about why players with disabilities

204
00:12:09,826 --> 00:12:10,447
play games.

205
00:12:10,927 --> 00:12:15,930
And if we think about things, it might be that we make some very base assumptions about

206
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,191
why people play games.

207
00:12:17,591 --> 00:12:21,614
And me, as a user researcher, the most important thing for me is to talk to players and see

208
00:12:21,654 --> 00:12:22,574
if there is a difference.

209
00:12:23,135 --> 00:12:28,019
So we went and talked to 122 people, we put out a survey where we asked people that exact

210
00:12:28,059 --> 00:12:30,601
question, why is gaming important to you?

211
00:12:31,281 --> 00:12:37,306
We also asked in person at PAX East a set of attendees who did not identify as people

212
00:12:37,346 --> 00:12:38,147
with disabilities.

213
00:12:38,627 --> 00:12:43,011
And as a result, we were able to compare the information that was provided by our disabled

214
00:12:43,051 --> 00:12:49,015
players as well as by people who did not necessarily identify up front as being players with disabilities.

215
00:12:50,024 --> 00:12:54,308
When we did that analysis, we found that there was a number of themes that emerged over time.

216
00:12:54,828 --> 00:12:59,612
And we found that people did gaming for largely the same sorts of reasons.

217
00:12:59,993 --> 00:13:01,594
They did it to connect with others.

218
00:13:02,075 --> 00:13:04,096
They did it to benefit from games played.

219
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:08,580
And that is an interesting one, because sometimes it was about skills, and sometimes it was

220
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,743
about the opportunity to potentially learn something new.

221
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:16,247
We also found that people wanted to divert themselves in different ways.

222
00:13:16,648 --> 00:13:19,551
They wanted to escape into a world that others had created.

223
00:13:19,571 --> 00:13:24,736
Now I want to emphasize that that's not necessarily about escaping disability, because we heard

224
00:13:24,776 --> 00:13:26,418
this across our groups.

225
00:13:26,858 --> 00:13:30,902
It was about escaping into something that someone else had created, about being able

226
00:13:30,922 --> 00:13:35,066
to leave the real world behind and become immersed for a period of time.

227
00:13:35,987 --> 00:13:39,990
Perhaps one of the nicest things that came out of it was the fact that it was a piece of shared culture.

228
00:13:40,331 --> 00:13:42,092
People saw games as art.

229
00:13:42,432 --> 00:13:46,996
It was something that they compared to things like literature and movies and going to museums.

230
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:52,280
Places where often people with disabilities are excluded due to the types of things that are used

231
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:55,702
in communicating information, games didn't have those.

232
00:13:55,982 --> 00:14:01,486
They were able to share culture with their peers in a way that often they were not allowed to otherwise.

233
00:14:01,747 --> 00:14:04,489
So like for example, even in this room, let me ask you guys a question.

234
00:14:04,529 --> 00:14:05,489
Who here plays games?

235
00:14:07,066 --> 00:14:07,847
Good, good.

236
00:14:07,967 --> 00:14:08,847
I knew this was going to work.

237
00:14:08,887 --> 00:14:09,768
Good, that was a good question.

238
00:14:10,188 --> 00:14:13,551
So let me ask though, so who here plays more than one game?

239
00:14:14,792 --> 00:14:19,175
And who here looks for a friend and then goes and plays the game that that friend is playing?

240
00:14:19,975 --> 00:14:22,697
What if it's even not your favorite game, you still do it, right?

241
00:14:23,338 --> 00:14:28,001
Because you're connecting with friends, you're wanting to be with that person.

242
00:14:28,341 --> 00:14:30,863
The game is just the bar you went to.

243
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:35,184
But the reality is you made that choice to be with that person.

244
00:14:35,425 --> 00:14:38,229
And that's the same for a player with disabilities.

245
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:39,651
There's no difference.

246
00:14:39,691 --> 00:14:41,694
They're just connecting with their friends.

247
00:14:42,054 --> 00:14:43,677
The bar is the game.

248
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:44,378
That's right.

249
00:14:45,233 --> 00:14:48,638
And one of the things that echoed throughout the data was that it was about enablement.

250
00:14:48,778 --> 00:14:51,001
It was about enabling people into a space.

251
00:14:51,322 --> 00:14:55,748
The thing that people with disabilities identified differently than our non-disabled players

252
00:14:55,788 --> 00:15:00,635
from PAX East was that they felt that games enabled them to play with their friends on

253
00:15:00,675 --> 00:15:01,857
a level playing field.

254
00:15:02,206 --> 00:15:06,390
where they may not be able to do that in the real world, in games they were able to.

255
00:15:06,631 --> 00:15:09,173
And this came through really clearly in our data.

256
00:15:09,193 --> 00:15:11,296
And it was a really positive thing to hear,

257
00:15:11,636 --> 00:15:14,078
and something that we communicate to you now as designers,

258
00:15:14,359 --> 00:15:17,442
that your technology is not just about playing and fun and games,

259
00:15:17,802 --> 00:15:21,726
but it really is a massive enabling technology for people to do things

260
00:15:21,927 --> 00:15:23,889
that they may not be able to do otherwise.

261
00:15:23,949 --> 00:15:25,230
The mechanics of the game...

262
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:27,746
tell you what you can do.

263
00:15:28,047 --> 00:15:34,089
I can jump no higher in the game than my completely wheelchair-enabled friend, because the game

264
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:35,070
doesn't allow it.

265
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:37,070
So that's the beauty of games.

266
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:42,313
I'm looking at Linda for this, because I started AbleGamers as from an EverQuest.

267
00:15:42,513 --> 00:15:48,135
And EverQuest and MMOs are really special to me, because they are these lives that you

268
00:15:48,175 --> 00:15:49,236
can kind of jump into.

269
00:15:49,536 --> 00:15:54,578
But we're all bound by the game, and we're not necessarily identified by our disability.

270
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,679
And when we look at multiplayer play,

271
00:15:57,019 --> 00:16:00,501
we found that players were playing not only with their online friends

272
00:16:00,601 --> 00:16:02,001
or real friends in real life,

273
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:04,143
but they were jumping on with strangers to play

274
00:16:04,403 --> 00:16:07,784
because it's something that they do just to get some social activity.

275
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:11,066
And they also are part of large clans and guilds.

276
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:13,667
So we find that these players are largely the same,

277
00:16:13,968 --> 00:16:17,529
playing the same types of multiplayer games that others do.

278
00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:20,091
And as a result, the myth starts to fall away

279
00:16:20,131 --> 00:16:22,492
that disabled players are playing single-player games

280
00:16:22,532 --> 00:16:24,053
in their homes that are self-paced.

281
00:16:24,653 --> 00:16:30,855
Our players are playing large-scale, commercial, AAA titles that are multiplayer games.

282
00:16:31,475 --> 00:16:35,596
They sell millions of copies, and they're being sold to players with disabilities now

283
00:16:35,936 --> 00:16:37,457
when those options are available.

284
00:16:37,957 --> 00:16:42,238
And indeed, when we talk to players with disabilities, they identify as gamers.

285
00:16:42,658 --> 00:16:45,019
So we distinguish between gamers and players.

286
00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:46,940
Gamers we see as a broader identity.

287
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,000
And some of our players with disabilities actually said,

288
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:52,322
no, I'm not a gamer, and I don't want to identify that way.

289
00:16:52,642 --> 00:16:54,302
I'm not part of that culture.

290
00:16:54,782 --> 00:16:57,903
It is simply something I do, but I still play games.

291
00:16:58,303 --> 00:17:00,984
But we did find that for over half of our players,

292
00:17:01,024 --> 00:17:02,365
it was their primary hobby.

293
00:17:02,705 --> 00:17:04,065
It was the key thing that they did.

294
00:17:05,964 --> 00:17:11,068
60% nearly identified as gamers and they even distinguished between whether they were hardcore

295
00:17:11,088 --> 00:17:12,869
gamers or casual gamers.

296
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:14,450
And we had about a third each.

297
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:22,175
We then had a typical play session of over two hours with nearly a quarter of our players

298
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:25,277
playing for over five hours in a typical play session.

299
00:17:25,938 --> 00:17:28,400
Our players are people who love gaming.

300
00:17:28,801 --> 00:17:33,435
And they do it either as part of their lives and part of a broader set of hobbies,

301
00:17:34,057 --> 00:17:35,903
or as a key part of their lives.

302
00:17:38,168 --> 00:17:41,189
So how did we create the accessible player experience?

303
00:17:41,209 --> 00:17:43,510
So most of you should have a deck of cards in your hands.

304
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:45,851
I've actually seen some of you thumb through it,

305
00:17:45,871 --> 00:17:46,872
so it's really exciting.

306
00:17:47,952 --> 00:17:49,893
Wanna kinda take you on the journey of how we got here.

307
00:17:50,593 --> 00:17:52,554
So the current accessible practices,

308
00:17:52,894 --> 00:17:56,096
and look, I wrote in Cluedification, I'm part of this,

309
00:17:56,756 --> 00:17:59,277
is that they're heavily based on checklists.

310
00:17:59,817 --> 00:18:04,039
Checklists are really great at the end of your pipeline

311
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:06,580
to make sure you've potentially done everything right,

312
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,581
but they don't actually.

313
00:18:08,261 --> 00:18:10,122
Tell you what you need to do.

314
00:18:11,483 --> 00:18:13,244
Checklist and the way we're doing it right now,

315
00:18:13,724 --> 00:18:16,225
it focuses on not creating experiences.

316
00:18:16,525 --> 00:18:18,686
It says, hey, you need to have closed captioning.

317
00:18:19,047 --> 00:18:21,088
But if you make the text to six,

318
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:23,989
sure, you checked the box that you had closed captioning,

319
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:25,430
but no one can read it.

320
00:18:26,671 --> 00:18:28,452
It stifles innovation.

321
00:18:28,532 --> 00:18:32,474
Some of the most creative people in the world are in this room,

322
00:18:32,914 --> 00:18:34,295
mainly because you chose to come here.

323
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:38,694
And you guys are creating great things all the time.

324
00:18:39,935 --> 00:18:42,798
The way we currently do it, it says this is what you must do.

325
00:18:42,858 --> 00:18:44,399
It prescribes a solution.

326
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,081
But you may actually have a better way.

327
00:18:47,582 --> 00:18:50,805
And fascinatingly, accessibility is one of the only places in the world

328
00:18:50,825 --> 00:18:52,606
that we still use rules for design,

329
00:18:52,926 --> 00:18:54,908
where we tell you what you can and cannot do.

330
00:18:55,489 --> 00:18:57,390
Most designers have moved on from that

331
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:59,772
and focused on a more design-thinking process,

332
00:19:00,073 --> 00:19:02,555
where they try to build empathy and understand their players.

333
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,378
And then move into design, then test and iterate.

334
00:19:05,758 --> 00:19:10,783
Yet in accessibility, we still largely focus on meet this checklist and you'll be okay.

335
00:19:11,064 --> 00:19:15,348
And what we're challenging in this presentation is that that paradigm needs to change.

336
00:19:16,149 --> 00:19:18,311
And it really doesn't have player data built in.

337
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:26,036
When we did APX, when we did this, we came in and we said, you know, traditionally there's these silos,

338
00:19:26,076 --> 00:19:28,878
and as you alluded to, we don't fall into those silos.

339
00:19:29,138 --> 00:19:35,042
We also started finding that different groups of people needed the same thing.

340
00:19:35,682 --> 00:19:39,985
And so we said we can simplify this idea and bring it all together.

341
00:19:41,693 --> 00:19:46,275
So what we did was we felt that we needed to build a stronger database about what people

342
00:19:46,455 --> 00:19:50,976
use and to try to build out from what is happening right now in the industry.

343
00:19:51,376 --> 00:19:56,158
And what we asked players, building on the successes of the last 15 years of beginning

344
00:19:56,478 --> 00:20:00,980
the journey of accessibility in gaming, is to talk to players about what were the top

345
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,921
five accessibility options that they looked for in games.

346
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:07,002
And when they came back, they came back with 510 answers.

347
00:20:08,948 --> 00:20:11,189
In any other piece of technology that I've worked in,

348
00:20:11,229 --> 00:20:11,990
I get three words.

349
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:14,352
In this, I got 510 people,

350
00:20:14,652 --> 00:20:16,053
or 155 people providing 510 different answers.

351
00:20:16,073 --> 00:20:16,853
And some of them wrote tomes.

352
00:20:23,409 --> 00:20:27,630
I mean, most of the time in any sort of survey that you do, you usually expect to have sort

353
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,671
of open answer questions mostly skipped.

354
00:20:30,131 --> 00:20:33,152
This we literally had paragraphs of text that we were having to sort through.

355
00:20:33,392 --> 00:20:37,593
I felt bad for Jin because she had to kind of go through and parse out what the person

356
00:20:37,633 --> 00:20:41,174
was actually saying so that she could put it in the right thing.

357
00:20:42,514 --> 00:20:44,255
I guess that's what it means to be a PhD student, right?

358
00:20:44,275 --> 00:20:44,715
That's right.

359
00:20:45,015 --> 00:20:46,636
So, what did they come up with?

360
00:20:47,843 --> 00:20:51,605
They came up with this idea we found of this access and challenge.

361
00:20:51,665 --> 00:20:54,367
So I want to talk about access and what this means.

362
00:20:54,808 --> 00:20:57,509
They were looking for controller personalization.

363
00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:02,213
The vast majority of them were looking for changing the way they input into the game.

364
00:21:02,753 --> 00:21:04,473
They wanted alternate channels.

365
00:21:04,913 --> 00:21:06,454
They wanted different ways.

366
00:21:06,554 --> 00:21:08,634
They're always turning on or looking for features

367
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,375
to get the information out in a different way.

368
00:21:11,915 --> 00:21:13,155
They wanted alternate inputs.

369
00:21:13,175 --> 00:21:15,276
They needed to plug or wanted to plug something

370
00:21:15,476 --> 00:21:17,437
in that wasn't standard.

371
00:21:18,137 --> 00:21:19,017
Clear text.

372
00:21:19,337 --> 00:21:21,278
This is that thing about checkbox.

373
00:21:21,578 --> 00:21:23,098
I have closed captioning, but it's

374
00:21:23,138 --> 00:21:24,538
six-point font at the bottom.

375
00:21:25,859 --> 00:21:27,639
Recoloring options, as we alluded to.

376
00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:30,840
They were looking for visual, clear visual channels.

377
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,340
Is there a spelling error?

378
00:21:42,213 --> 00:21:44,273
We will get to that in just a few minutes.

379
00:21:44,654 --> 00:21:46,234
But just to preempt the question,

380
00:21:46,274 --> 00:21:47,715
so alternative channels, we're talking

381
00:21:47,735 --> 00:21:48,775
about different modalities.

382
00:21:49,156 --> 00:21:51,417
So providing information through a different sense

383
00:21:51,497 --> 00:21:53,918
in some way, either enhancing it or replacing it.

384
00:21:55,138 --> 00:21:56,919
Clear visual channels, the ability

385
00:21:56,999 --> 00:21:59,380
to know what's important on the screen

386
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,801
and potentially get rid of the things that aren't important.

387
00:22:02,301 --> 00:22:04,622
MMOs were always great for this, because you could turn down

388
00:22:04,662 --> 00:22:07,463
the render rate and get rid of all the waving grass

389
00:22:07,543 --> 00:22:09,184
so you could see the quest object.

390
00:22:10,985 --> 00:22:13,686
Clear audio channels, and games do this pretty well.

391
00:22:13,706 --> 00:22:15,907
I don't want the music, it bothers me.

392
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:17,808
Let me turn that up, let me turn that down.

393
00:22:18,188 --> 00:22:21,389
And lastly, the ability to change the HUD itself.

394
00:22:21,789 --> 00:22:23,790
Let me figure out how to get things.

395
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:28,772
And so, the access loop, this is what you guys are always, as game developers, working on.

396
00:22:29,192 --> 00:22:31,453
Is this, to create this loop, this flow.

397
00:22:32,154 --> 00:22:32,374
in it.

398
00:22:32,715 --> 00:22:35,522
And right now we're going to build this out a little bit so you guys understand it.

399
00:22:35,823 --> 00:22:39,071
So a player action and understanding the state of the game.

400
00:22:39,592 --> 00:22:41,637
So access really is about.

401
00:22:43,035 --> 00:22:47,740
The all of the game that's not the world or story that you've created.

402
00:22:48,061 --> 00:22:50,343
The ability to make that next decision.

403
00:22:50,383 --> 00:22:53,127
The ability to take in what just happened.

404
00:22:53,587 --> 00:22:56,691
And so this is really where we traditionally think of accessibility as sitting.

405
00:22:56,731 --> 00:23:01,316
Because we often think in terms of either motor disabilities or perceptual disabilities

406
00:23:01,356 --> 00:23:02,938
or different kinds of sensory disabilities.

407
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:08,602
And this does tie into that because we found that largely without these sorts of options,

408
00:23:08,923 --> 00:23:10,684
you couldn't move on in the game.

409
00:23:10,744 --> 00:23:13,065
You couldn't take those actions that you need to do.

410
00:23:13,526 --> 00:23:15,407
But it turns out that it's a lot more than that.

411
00:23:16,265 --> 00:23:21,366
So after everyone's able to get information in and out of the game,

412
00:23:21,586 --> 00:23:24,167
we started seeing these challenge options.

413
00:23:24,567 --> 00:23:27,627
So the challenge options, you want me to jump on this horse,

414
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:29,308
you want me to do this jump puzzle,

415
00:23:29,368 --> 00:23:31,488
you want me to solve this thing.

416
00:23:31,928 --> 00:23:34,529
And so these were performance options.

417
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:37,670
They were looking for ways to potentially slow it down

418
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,490
or an assist for something.

419
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:42,291
These are our traditional Twitch options that we talk about,

420
00:23:42,531 --> 00:23:45,831
things that make the game tuned to the person's skills.

421
00:23:46,772 --> 00:23:50,417
A skip option, giving me the ability to just not do this.

422
00:23:50,977 --> 00:23:52,619
I hate jump puzzles.

423
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:57,986
If in the first part of your game, it is a jump puzzle, I'm done.

424
00:23:58,166 --> 00:24:00,308
I put it down. You could tell the greatest story.

425
00:24:00,328 --> 00:24:03,913
There could be a million dollars on the other side of the jump puzzle, and I'm just leaving it there.

426
00:24:05,399 --> 00:24:09,064
One of the things we often look at now is being able to skip quick time options.

427
00:24:09,485 --> 00:24:14,193
So quick time events which became very popular around 2014 and then everyone started asking

428
00:24:14,213 --> 00:24:15,975
in 2015 why the heck are we doing this.

429
00:24:16,376 --> 00:24:20,062
Now we're starting to see that those have become skip options in games as well.

430
00:24:20,482 --> 00:24:25,045
And especially for many people who aren't able to press a key really, really quickly

431
00:24:25,246 --> 00:24:28,087
over and over again, they're really essential.

432
00:24:28,368 --> 00:24:32,250
And we see that, for example, in Spider-Man this year, where you could replace the quick

433
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:36,333
time options with the movie play of the ideal path through it so you could still get the

434
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:36,773
story.

435
00:24:37,594 --> 00:24:38,394
Training options.

436
00:24:38,454 --> 00:24:42,577
So I play every once in a while when I have a few minutes to be able to play games, I

437
00:24:42,617 --> 00:24:43,478
play Overwatch.

438
00:24:44,038 --> 00:24:48,421
And training options are important because I don't want to debut my D.Va because I have

439
00:24:48,561 --> 00:24:49,782
no idea what I'm doing.

440
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:53,004
But they have this beautiful world where I can go and play

441
00:24:53,045 --> 00:24:55,466
and over and over again and get good

442
00:24:55,546 --> 00:24:58,328
before Craig tells me to not log in anymore

443
00:24:58,689 --> 00:24:59,689
because I'm terrible at it.

444
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:03,612
And when you tie into that that many players with disabilities

445
00:25:03,632 --> 00:25:06,154
will have different configurations when they go into games,

446
00:25:06,635 --> 00:25:09,817
either of their controllers or of the types of settings that they need,

447
00:25:10,157 --> 00:25:12,099
they need those opportunities to practice.

448
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:14,841
And that's what we were hearing, that they wanted to learn their controls

449
00:25:14,881 --> 00:25:16,602
or learn their settings that they've changed

450
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:19,264
before they enter into the game, as an example.

451
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,225
And lastly, progression options.

452
00:25:21,665 --> 00:25:24,626
I did finally do the jump puzzle to get the million dollars.

453
00:25:24,746 --> 00:25:28,887
Give me the opportunity to save that so I never have to do it again.

454
00:25:29,247 --> 00:25:35,249
So they were really looking for ways to make sure that all of their hard-earned progress was saved.

455
00:25:35,349 --> 00:25:37,970
And for people with cognitive disabilities, it was largely about...

456
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:44,753
trying to capture that progress that has happened that they need to understand but haven't necessarily retained.

457
00:25:45,054 --> 00:25:47,655
So things like journaling or quest

458
00:25:47,735 --> 00:25:52,438
pointers provide information to the player so they can review what they need to do next.

459
00:25:52,758 --> 00:25:54,379
So now we have this complete loop.

460
00:25:54,439 --> 00:26:00,022
This is what all of you guys are doing, which is the player takes an action, the state of the game changes,

461
00:26:00,542 --> 00:26:03,484
understanding that new state, making the decision,

462
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:06,960
taking the decision loop.

463
00:26:07,481 --> 00:26:09,943
And so you see that there's blue ring,

464
00:26:09,963 --> 00:26:12,766
which is your access ring, always turning.

465
00:26:13,126 --> 00:26:15,888
And then there's this orange little side ring,

466
00:26:16,269 --> 00:26:18,090
which is where your challenge stuff comes in.

467
00:26:18,391 --> 00:26:19,612
So as we start talking,

468
00:26:19,652 --> 00:26:21,133
and we start talking about the patterns,

469
00:26:21,153 --> 00:26:22,694
and we start talking about the deck of cards,

470
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:25,657
understanding where you are in this loop

471
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:29,020
gives you a real good clue of what set of cards

472
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,381
you should really be focusing on.

473
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,402
And when we look at the type of information that people were giving us,

474
00:26:34,522 --> 00:26:37,165
we asked them alongside the priority question,

475
00:26:37,525 --> 00:26:39,967
where were there situations that worked really well for them,

476
00:26:40,207 --> 00:26:43,570
and where were there situations where they had games that they couldn't play?

477
00:26:44,391 --> 00:26:47,753
When we talked to them about the types of games they couldn't play,

478
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:50,916
almost always it was an access option that was missing.

479
00:26:51,476 --> 00:26:54,659
While we found the complete range of options we've just presented to you

480
00:26:54,719 --> 00:26:56,460
in games where they were able to play well

481
00:26:56,521 --> 00:26:59,103
as things that they valued and made it a good game for them,

482
00:26:59,623 --> 00:27:04,730
When we looked at those situations where they couldn't play, it was almost always due to an access option.

483
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:09,336
And so this gave us the cue that really access has to come first.

484
00:27:09,736 --> 00:27:11,599
They have to be able to get around that player loop.

485
00:27:11,979 --> 00:27:15,023
And then once they can, we can start tuning that experience.

486
00:27:15,344 --> 00:27:16,866
And we represent this with the APX...

487
00:27:17,604 --> 00:27:21,067
a pyramid that's now on the screen, where on the bottom layer you have to have your

488
00:27:21,167 --> 00:27:25,411
access options in place, and then a set of challenge options that modify the obstacles,

489
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:29,815
either the performance, the cognitive, or the emotional challenge that happens in the

490
00:27:29,855 --> 00:27:30,176
game.

491
00:27:30,676 --> 00:27:34,880
And then once you resolve those items for the individual, they can have the accessible

492
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,562
player experience that they want to have.

493
00:27:38,418 --> 00:27:42,023
So as part of this, what we've done is we've built out a pattern language.

494
00:27:42,303 --> 00:27:46,268
We wanted something that took this data that we've discovered over the last year or so

495
00:27:46,829 --> 00:27:52,816
and built out something that's as visible and as useful as guidelines can be, but do

496
00:27:52,856 --> 00:27:55,079
it in a way that pushes design to the left.

497
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,821
Something that allows generative design,

498
00:27:58,061 --> 00:28:01,523
where you're able to take advantage of your design knowledge

499
00:28:01,643 --> 00:28:03,704
and innovate new accessibility.

500
00:28:04,404 --> 00:28:06,485
So what we've done is we've set, for example,

501
00:28:06,645 --> 00:28:09,927
or to start with, a set of 12 access options.

502
00:28:10,387 --> 00:28:12,908
And they look at, in particular, that player loop

503
00:28:13,128 --> 00:28:16,070
and how do we provide that flexible control and presentation.

504
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:19,672
Now each pattern, such as second channel...

505
00:28:19,692 --> 00:28:21,673
I was going to make a point, but you won't...

506
00:28:21,693 --> 00:28:22,893
Oh, I'm sorry, you can make a point.

507
00:28:24,805 --> 00:28:28,927
I've been doing AbleGamers for 15 years and to the point where you made about moving it

508
00:28:28,947 --> 00:28:34,529
to the left and why it's important, so many times I've had game companies, big game companies,

509
00:28:35,009 --> 00:28:41,091
come to me six weeks before release and say, hey, yeah, so we want to make something accessible.

510
00:28:42,091 --> 00:28:43,792
And there's that whole like bug.

511
00:28:44,629 --> 00:28:50,831
curve that we all know, which is like if you think about it way to the left, it's accessibility

512
00:28:50,872 --> 00:28:58,635
or the bug is real cheap to fix, but six weeks before you release a title, it's really expensive.

513
00:28:58,675 --> 00:28:59,995
So when we took this on.

514
00:29:00,895 --> 00:29:06,900
The idea was to try to give you guys language that let you move these thought processes

515
00:29:07,401 --> 00:29:09,883
before you've even made a single line of code.

516
00:29:10,363 --> 00:29:16,448
And now accessibility is cheap to include versus a Blizzard title.

517
00:29:17,469 --> 00:29:21,913
Six weeks before release, reaching out to me and I'm going like, oh yeah, good luck.

518
00:29:23,802 --> 00:29:25,123
So what we've tried to do is we've

519
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:27,783
tried to encapsulate these in design patterns.

520
00:29:27,903 --> 00:29:30,744
Now each pattern comes with a design problem.

521
00:29:31,164 --> 00:29:34,445
That design problem captures what players in general

522
00:29:34,765 --> 00:29:37,085
will encounter in your game that may be a problem.

523
00:29:37,405 --> 00:29:39,166
So for example, second channel, which

524
00:29:39,206 --> 00:29:40,606
taps into the alternative channels

525
00:29:40,626 --> 00:29:43,387
we were talking about earlier, is the design problem

526
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:46,747
is that players are either unable or were unreliably

527
00:29:46,847 --> 00:29:49,808
able to take in information through a particular modality.

528
00:29:50,168 --> 00:29:53,069
So they can't see or hear some information reliably.

529
00:29:54,049 --> 00:29:55,931
We link that to a set of drivers.

530
00:29:56,011 --> 00:29:58,573
This is where the disability side of things comes in,

531
00:29:58,933 --> 00:30:02,435
where we link it, for example, to players who are blind or who have low vision,

532
00:30:02,816 --> 00:30:06,018
who cannot necessarily see the information on the screen,

533
00:30:06,378 --> 00:30:10,341
but also people who have hearing disabilities or sign language-using deaf people

534
00:30:10,661 --> 00:30:13,423
who maybe need either a replacement in the form of captions

535
00:30:13,744 --> 00:30:17,486
or an enhancement of some kind to some auditory content

536
00:30:17,767 --> 00:30:21,029
where we need to provide either a visual or haptic enhancement.

537
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:32,493
And finally, players who are possibly in a noisy environment, where we try to push out to a broader player base, where they need either visual or audio information in an alternative way.

538
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:40,296
So when we move on and we look at how do we try to encapsulate this for all of you,

539
00:30:40,596 --> 00:30:44,780
it's important that we also provide a set of examples in a design solution.

540
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,503
And that design solution, first of all, comes in a general form.

541
00:30:48,824 --> 00:30:52,647
Players can select additional channels of information via different modalities.

542
00:30:52,948 --> 00:30:54,749
I am not telling you to put captions in.

543
00:30:55,822 --> 00:30:59,904
It may be that in some cases, you don't need those particular captions

544
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:01,365
because it's not speech content,

545
00:31:01,605 --> 00:31:04,988
but you still need some audio enhancement happening in your game.

546
00:31:05,908 --> 00:31:09,671
And as a result, this is a very broad set of design options,

547
00:31:10,071 --> 00:31:13,433
and you need help thinking and innovating and ideating around them.

548
00:31:13,753 --> 00:31:17,956
And the beauty of design patterns is we can find the best examples in the industry

549
00:31:18,216 --> 00:31:21,599
and provide them for you for ways to inspire in your game.

550
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:23,980
And I'll pass to Mark for the second channel examples.

551
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,002
So let's talk about some second channels.

552
00:31:26,082 --> 00:31:28,844
One of the ones that's really great is Madden 2018.

553
00:31:29,224 --> 00:31:33,828
So Madden uses haptic to help you make the perfect kick.

554
00:31:34,168 --> 00:31:36,290
It'll do vibrations when it needs to,

555
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:37,631
when you're in those sweet spots,

556
00:31:37,991 --> 00:31:40,773
so that you get an indication not only visually

557
00:31:40,833 --> 00:31:43,555
on the screen, but you're getting that second channel

558
00:31:43,856 --> 00:31:45,697
that tells you this is the time to do it.

559
00:31:47,065 --> 00:31:48,485
Another great one, Street Fighter 2.

560
00:31:48,545 --> 00:31:55,649
There are blind competitive players of Street Fighter because every single move in Street

561
00:31:55,669 --> 00:31:59,851
Fighter has a sound associated with it that is unique to that move.

562
00:32:01,091 --> 00:32:06,014
So they can competitively play this game because they memorize the soundscape and they know

563
00:32:06,054 --> 00:32:07,414
if I hear a, I need a...

564
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:09,075
Exactly.

565
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:09,375
Right.

566
00:32:11,478 --> 00:32:13,839
One of the ones you alluded to, Fortnite.

567
00:32:13,879 --> 00:32:17,920
This is one of the breakout amazing second channels.

568
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,780
So they did this because mobile,

569
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:22,521
and I guess you play Fortnite on a bus and at school

570
00:32:22,561 --> 00:32:24,181
when you're supposed to be doing your math homework.

571
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:27,362
And so you see this sound ring.

572
00:32:27,402 --> 00:32:31,823
The sound ring around it gives you a visual indication

573
00:32:32,223 --> 00:32:33,484
of the sound around you.

574
00:32:33,784 --> 00:32:36,544
So you can see footsteps and you can see flames.

575
00:32:36,604 --> 00:32:37,905
And while I've never played Fortnite,

576
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:39,365
I think those are important.

577
00:32:39,685 --> 00:32:40,265
You have kids.

578
00:32:41,546 --> 00:32:46,890
So, one of the really nice things about this example is the fact that this was largely invented through good design.

579
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:51,453
It was thinking about what the players needed and what was the design problem that was being solved,

580
00:32:51,714 --> 00:32:53,775
which is where we've tried to position the patterns.

581
00:32:54,075 --> 00:32:58,479
And that's one of the reasons that this and the Madden example earlier are really nice examples.

582
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:04,482
Because they are really about creating really interesting and innovative designs,

583
00:33:04,942 --> 00:33:08,424
even though they're fulfilling an accessibility aspect of the game.

584
00:33:08,984 --> 00:33:11,706
And then what we think of as potentially a second channel,

585
00:33:11,746 --> 00:33:14,347
which is this has a voiceover associated with it,

586
00:33:14,647 --> 00:33:19,310
and it's just a simple stylized closed captioning,

587
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:21,031
is what I like to call it when they do it like this.

588
00:33:22,134 --> 00:33:25,555
Another great example, this is one of my favorites, Left 4 Dead 2.

589
00:33:26,135 --> 00:33:31,356
They have sounds that are really important for the gameplay.

590
00:33:31,877 --> 00:33:35,037
And there's the option to turn on, and I know they're really small,

591
00:33:36,038 --> 00:33:40,599
what I like to call the brackets, which gives you a text indication

592
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:42,779
that something is about to happen.

593
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:47,101
So you have things like environmental sounds, like the fact that there's a groan

594
00:33:47,161 --> 00:33:48,521
and something is moving towards you.

595
00:33:48,889 --> 00:33:50,990
or the fact that gunfire happens around you.

596
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:54,653
And these sorts of indicators allow someone who can't hear

597
00:33:54,993 --> 00:33:57,275
to be able to identify that soundscape that's

598
00:33:57,335 --> 00:33:58,876
very important within the game.

599
00:33:59,256 --> 00:34:01,498
It also has the traditional types of caption

600
00:34:01,518 --> 00:34:03,219
that we expect for speech, but they're

601
00:34:03,259 --> 00:34:04,520
enhanced in different ways.

602
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,542
And this is one of the best examples of caption

603
00:34:06,562 --> 00:34:08,043
that's happening in the industry right now.

604
00:34:08,063 --> 00:34:10,424
It's also an example of clear channel,

605
00:34:10,785 --> 00:34:12,906
because you can turn parts of it on and off.

606
00:34:13,435 --> 00:34:14,917
If you don't need certain parts of the captioning.

607
00:34:14,937 --> 00:34:15,257
That's right.

608
00:34:15,477 --> 00:34:16,438
It's a really fantastic example.

609
00:34:16,458 --> 00:34:17,919
We'll learn it as you go through your stuff.

610
00:34:17,959 --> 00:34:21,963
But now, because we've been doing this every time we see a game or we hear people talk

611
00:34:22,003 --> 00:34:26,587
about a game, it's been happening all GDC so far, we whisper to each other, oh that's

612
00:34:26,607 --> 00:34:27,628
a helping hands pattern.

613
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:28,909
Oh, we got some clear text there.

614
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:30,350
Oh look, a moderation and all things.

615
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:32,532
Oh man, we got some same controls but different.

616
00:34:32,972 --> 00:34:33,633
We're very odd.

617
00:34:33,693 --> 00:34:33,873
It's okay.

618
00:34:33,893 --> 00:34:34,073
It's just.

619
00:34:34,093 --> 00:34:34,273
It's just.

620
00:34:34,293 --> 00:34:34,514
It's just.

621
00:34:34,534 --> 00:34:34,714
It's just.

622
00:34:34,734 --> 00:34:34,914
It's just.

623
00:34:34,934 --> 00:34:35,134
It's just.

624
00:34:35,154 --> 00:34:35,535
It's just.

625
00:34:35,555 --> 00:34:35,735
It's just.

626
00:34:36,395 --> 00:34:41,139
So, speaking of same controls but different, you see what I did there.

627
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:46,064
One of the other aspects, so we've just talked about something that's about that flexible presentation,

628
00:34:46,104 --> 00:34:50,408
and we wanted to highlight probably one of the most important ones for flexible controls.

629
00:34:50,728 --> 00:34:53,251
And that is the idea of having same controls but different.

630
00:34:53,571 --> 00:34:57,014
Someone needs a different set of controls, so we need a way to provide them a way

631
00:34:57,315 --> 00:35:01,238
to do exactly the same thing as players using standard controllers.

632
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:06,361
So in this case it's about the players cannot effectively use a set of controls in the standard setup.

633
00:35:06,661 --> 00:35:12,024
And this covers a wide variety of different physical disability design aspects,

634
00:35:12,324 --> 00:35:16,066
where it can be either a full remapping, which of course is the most ideal,

635
00:35:16,367 --> 00:35:20,629
but also some specifics like the fact that you can either toggle or hold a control,

636
00:35:20,909 --> 00:35:22,130
which might be quite important.

637
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:26,432
So having auto-run as opposed to having to hold a particular control,

638
00:35:26,672 --> 00:35:27,473
thank you very much.

639
00:35:27,933 --> 00:35:29,655
Numlock key for every MMO out there.

640
00:35:29,695 --> 00:35:32,058
Yeah, exactly, every Numlock key you can imagine,

641
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,661
but also my personal favorite, Shadow of War,

642
00:35:34,941 --> 00:35:37,384
where I ended up with basically a hand that couldn't open

643
00:35:37,564 --> 00:35:39,466
after running around as Talion for too long.

644
00:35:40,307 --> 00:35:42,389
We also have things like the fact that a player

645
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:45,893
may need a simpler control scheme for some reason.

646
00:35:46,554 --> 00:35:51,418
And as a result, we might provide that, and we see that in things like NHL for quite a

647
00:35:51,458 --> 00:35:57,623
long time now, having the 1994 set of controls as an alternative for people who don't want

648
00:35:57,643 --> 00:35:58,523
all of the detail.

649
00:35:58,824 --> 00:35:59,944
In NHL?

650
00:36:00,265 --> 00:36:01,025
Is that what I said?

651
00:36:01,185 --> 00:36:02,286
Is that hockey?

652
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:02,927
It's hockey.

653
00:36:02,947 --> 00:36:03,487
Is that a thing?

654
00:36:03,627 --> 00:36:04,108
It's a thing.

655
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:04,168
Oh.

656
00:36:07,446 --> 00:36:32,127
Canadians and your design. So in the design solution, of course, it's the ability to remap some of the controls. Now, this might be just one control or a full set of controls. But again, we're not telling you this is the way you have to do it because each game is quite different. A nice example where we had some problems with control this year was Spider Man, where there was a lot that had to be done with the two sticks and a lot of that had to be done with multiple triggers.

657
00:36:32,667 --> 00:36:36,749
And they weren't able to be remapped, which made it very difficult for people who weren't

658
00:36:36,789 --> 00:36:40,891
able to use the full range of motion in both of their hands or didn't have the strength.

659
00:36:41,252 --> 00:36:44,573
And as a result, being able to remap those would have been very important.

660
00:36:44,993 --> 00:36:46,594
So let's see some examples of this.

661
00:36:47,094 --> 00:36:53,558
Now you have the standard stuff like in Injustice 2 where I want to just change everything around

662
00:36:53,638 --> 00:36:54,218
and I can.

663
00:36:56,026 --> 00:37:01,231
You have in Nier Automaton, this game does this really well.

664
00:37:01,692 --> 00:37:07,317
Camera as well as horizontal camera and everything.

665
00:37:07,337 --> 00:37:09,219
There are options, we're not sure why they're there,

666
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:10,761
but we're pretty sure there's a reason.

667
00:37:11,101 --> 00:37:11,962
Like the fact that you can,

668
00:37:12,042 --> 00:37:13,603
instead of just the vertical camera,

669
00:37:13,643 --> 00:37:15,705
remap the horizontal from left to right.

670
00:37:16,106 --> 00:37:18,889
And you can remap also all the zoom settings as well,

671
00:37:18,949 --> 00:37:19,789
which is really nice.

672
00:37:21,678 --> 00:37:22,899
Then you have Splatoon 2.

673
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:27,585
You know, motion control is oftentimes very hard for a player with disabilities.

674
00:37:27,966 --> 00:37:32,752
Splatoon 2 allows you to choose between motion control or using your controllers, and then

675
00:37:32,772 --> 00:37:34,254
they let you remap it from there.

676
00:37:35,814 --> 00:37:37,875
We talked about the toggle versus hold

677
00:37:37,935 --> 00:37:40,056
when you go into Mass Effect Andromeda.

678
00:37:40,397 --> 00:37:43,458
You can choose, I want to click on and click off,

679
00:37:43,638 --> 00:37:45,379
or I wanna click, click, click, click, click, hold

680
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,600
to get something done.

681
00:37:47,921 --> 00:37:49,582
In Overcooked, this is one of the ones

682
00:37:49,602 --> 00:37:50,742
that's most creative to me.

683
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:53,504
It lets you map the left side and the right side

684
00:37:53,544 --> 00:37:55,725
of the controller, but it also lets you throw

685
00:37:55,785 --> 00:37:58,807
another controller in and remap it as well.

686
00:37:59,187 --> 00:38:01,108
So you can actually use two controllers

687
00:38:01,188 --> 00:38:02,089
and it'll see it as one.

688
00:38:03,029 --> 00:38:05,994
And so that might be something that you would have, for example, in CoPlay,

689
00:38:06,274 --> 00:38:08,398
where you have someone playing beside you,

690
00:38:08,418 --> 00:38:11,443
which taps into one of the challenge patterns that we're going to move into now.

691
00:38:11,463 --> 00:38:12,665
We're not moving into that one.

692
00:38:12,685 --> 00:38:12,865
We're not.

693
00:38:12,885 --> 00:38:13,887
That was helping hand.

694
00:38:17,015 --> 00:38:19,196
So we have the APX challenge design patterns,

695
00:38:19,216 --> 00:38:21,177
which are really about modifying the different types

696
00:38:21,217 --> 00:38:22,317
of challenges in your games.

697
00:38:22,657 --> 00:38:24,218
And it's either performance challenge,

698
00:38:24,498 --> 00:38:25,598
so things like Twitch,

699
00:38:25,698 --> 00:38:27,699
being able to do very precise movements

700
00:38:27,979 --> 00:38:30,420
or very fast movements to relate to different events.

701
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:34,061
The emotional challenges that someone might encounter,

702
00:38:34,181 --> 00:38:36,902
either because of things like jump scares or surprise,

703
00:38:37,342 --> 00:38:39,203
or being able to manage different aspects

704
00:38:39,243 --> 00:38:41,163
of very strong emotions and characters.

705
00:38:41,904 --> 00:38:43,704
Or problem-solving challenges,

706
00:38:43,784 --> 00:38:45,205
so our traditional puzzles.

707
00:38:46,878 --> 00:38:50,580
When we start looking at this set of patterns, we have things like bypass, and we talked

708
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:54,382
about that as being a really important thing to a lot of our players, the skip options

709
00:38:54,422 --> 00:38:58,804
that were in there, and essentially providing ways to skip different parts of content that

710
00:38:58,864 --> 00:39:02,826
people don't want to engage with, because they cannot successfully engage with it for

711
00:39:02,906 --> 00:39:03,547
some reason.

712
00:39:04,267 --> 00:39:08,029
Now this covers a wide variety of different design drivers, and some of them are physical,

713
00:39:08,349 --> 00:39:09,850
some of them are cognitive.

714
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:15,494
where people cannot necessarily react as quickly as they want to

715
00:39:15,634 --> 00:39:18,455
in a performance or Twitch type of challenge,

716
00:39:18,816 --> 00:39:20,857
where they might want hints, for example,

717
00:39:20,897 --> 00:39:23,118
to be able to skip a particular challenge,

718
00:39:23,678 --> 00:39:25,660
or to be able to, for example,

719
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,042
when dealing with a particular strong emotion,

720
00:39:29,342 --> 00:39:32,163
be able to skip over a cutscene that might cause difficulty.

721
00:39:32,664 --> 00:39:35,946
One of the really famous things that I tell people about this particular one,

722
00:39:36,546 --> 00:39:38,447
and I'm not bashing the makers of Heavy Rain,

723
00:39:38,847 --> 00:39:44,915
But I really struggled with the game Heavy Rain and only played about 20 minutes into it when something fairly traumatic happens.

724
00:39:45,356 --> 00:39:50,122
Now, because of who I am and because of my mental health, I really struggled with that game.

725
00:39:50,903 --> 00:39:53,987
When I presented these patterns to a young designer, he said,

726
00:39:54,007 --> 00:39:56,810
well, I'm going to challenge you right now and tell you you shouldn't be playing that game.

727
00:39:57,719 --> 00:39:59,721
And I said, OK, why is that?

728
00:39:59,741 --> 00:40:02,924
And he said, well, that's an important part of the story,

729
00:40:03,444 --> 00:40:05,086
and you should have to experience

730
00:40:05,126 --> 00:40:06,247
that to enjoy the game.

731
00:40:06,847 --> 00:40:08,789
To which I said, OK, but that means you're not

732
00:40:08,829 --> 00:40:09,990
selling that copy to me.

733
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,953
And indeed, even though I'm sure they're great games, I

734
00:40:12,973 --> 00:40:15,916
haven't bought a single title from the people

735
00:40:15,956 --> 00:40:16,956
who made Heavy Rain.

736
00:40:17,017 --> 00:40:18,798
And when I see it, I go, no, that's probably

737
00:40:18,838 --> 00:40:19,579
not a game for me.

738
00:40:20,652 --> 00:40:24,113
to which his response was, well, what are we supposed to do about it?

739
00:40:24,153 --> 00:40:26,734
I said, well, we have a pattern called moderation in all things,

740
00:40:26,754 --> 00:40:31,796
which is a different one than this, where you might change the way I engage with it.

741
00:40:31,976 --> 00:40:32,936
Well, what am I going to do?

742
00:40:33,836 --> 00:40:34,377
What am I going to do?

743
00:40:34,417 --> 00:40:35,097
Have you skip it?

744
00:40:35,637 --> 00:40:36,717
Well, maybe that's one thing.

745
00:40:37,157 --> 00:40:38,098
Well, what am I supposed to do?

746
00:40:38,218 --> 00:40:39,858
Flash up something that says look away now?

747
00:40:40,258 --> 00:40:41,599
And I went, well, why not?

748
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:44,240
And he said, wait, what?

749
00:40:46,437 --> 00:40:50,101
And I said, well, you've probably been trained that accessibility is about rules.

750
00:40:50,842 --> 00:40:52,684
But in fact, you're the designer.

751
00:40:52,724 --> 00:40:53,525
It's your game.

752
00:40:53,786 --> 00:40:56,168
If you want to put a bypass in, you can.

753
00:40:57,149 --> 00:40:59,130
If it's not acceptable for you to do that,

754
00:40:59,511 --> 00:41:02,293
we have another set of patterns to think around the problem

755
00:41:02,333 --> 00:41:04,856
to find alternatives that reach that balance.

756
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:07,558
And it changes the discussion of accessibility

757
00:41:07,878 --> 00:41:09,960
from a positional argument where it's

758
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:13,944
the player versus the developer to a negotiation

759
00:41:14,464 --> 00:41:16,746
of the designer trying to find ways

760
00:41:17,387 --> 00:41:20,170
to make it so that players can engage with their story

761
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:21,951
and have an experience in them.

762
00:41:22,492 --> 00:41:26,439
Which, as an added advantage, probably means some more people will buy your game.

763
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:28,602
What? Selling games is important?

764
00:41:28,663 --> 00:41:29,143
Quiet, you.

765
00:41:29,324 --> 00:41:29,584
What?

766
00:41:30,486 --> 00:41:32,910
So let's look at some examples of a bypass pattern.

767
00:41:34,051 --> 00:41:36,292
One of them is Ratchet and Clank.

768
00:41:36,332 --> 00:41:37,993
So at the beginning of Ratchet and Clank,

769
00:41:38,093 --> 00:41:40,255
it will, I believe, actually ask you a question

770
00:41:40,295 --> 00:41:41,876
on what you want to do with these things.

771
00:41:42,376 --> 00:41:44,637
And you can say, I just want to play them as movies.

772
00:41:45,258 --> 00:41:47,019
And it plays them as movies.

773
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:48,440
You can easily and evenly skip them.

774
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,121
This is really important, especially

775
00:41:50,161 --> 00:41:52,702
in the cognitive disability world, where they might not

776
00:41:52,742 --> 00:41:54,303
be able to take in the information.

777
00:41:54,343 --> 00:41:55,644
It might just be too much.

778
00:41:55,684 --> 00:41:56,965
They just want to play the game.

779
00:41:58,046 --> 00:42:02,528
I'm playing this stupid little family guy iPad game and they have all these little cut

780
00:42:02,588 --> 00:42:04,989
scenes in it and I could carelessly, I'm just like skip, skip, skip, skip, skip.

781
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:07,310
Just let me match the shapes together.

782
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:08,290
That's all I really want.

783
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:12,292
But for a player with cognitive disabilities, it may be essential that they not engage with

784
00:42:12,312 --> 00:42:14,813
that simply because it may overwhelm them in different ways.

785
00:42:15,474 --> 00:42:17,294
Spider-Man, quick time events.

786
00:42:17,875 --> 00:42:19,075
Again, you alluded to this.

787
00:42:19,135 --> 00:42:22,817
They let you just skip them and they make them as movies or little cut scenes.

788
00:42:22,977 --> 00:42:24,418
So my son loves those.

789
00:42:24,618 --> 00:42:27,099
I hate them because I'm really bad at them.

790
00:42:28,782 --> 00:42:31,584
This game is really, really great. I can never say the name.

791
00:42:31,604 --> 00:42:32,145
Infernium.

792
00:42:32,205 --> 00:42:38,809
Infernium. They let you turn off everything. The creator made a really good story and he

793
00:42:38,829 --> 00:42:41,571
made a really awesome game and none of these things were really important.

794
00:42:42,031 --> 00:42:45,713
So you can turn off, for example, the enemies if you don't want to have any particular combat

795
00:42:45,753 --> 00:42:49,576
and remove those performance challenges. This is something that we're often told by developers

796
00:42:49,596 --> 00:42:50,336
that can't do.

797
00:42:50,897 --> 00:42:52,939
And the question is, OK, that's fine.

798
00:42:52,979 --> 00:42:53,960
That's your choice.

799
00:42:54,381 --> 00:42:56,823
But if you want someone to hear your story, if that's the

800
00:42:56,863 --> 00:42:59,326
important part of it, is that a way that you could have

801
00:42:59,366 --> 00:43:01,528
someone engage with it by removing some of those?

802
00:43:01,569 --> 00:43:03,591
And we're actually seeing more games come on the market

803
00:43:03,911 --> 00:43:06,394
that have this as an option where you can simply explore

804
00:43:06,414 --> 00:43:06,814
the world.

805
00:43:07,355 --> 00:43:11,558
There was one we were told about on Monday at another conference,

806
00:43:12,338 --> 00:43:14,980
and it was a ghost mode that you could enter into.

807
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,482
You could explore the entire level in ghost mode

808
00:43:18,883 --> 00:43:21,264
before you actually did the level.

809
00:43:21,284 --> 00:43:24,646
So you could, like, there's no surprises, I know what's going to happen.

810
00:43:25,047 --> 00:43:26,788
I will say before we move from bypass,

811
00:43:26,868 --> 00:43:28,469
if you do put bypasses in your game,

812
00:43:28,529 --> 00:43:30,390
please do not make them like something like this.

813
00:43:30,831 --> 00:43:32,972
Yo, I see you're having trouble, want to skip it?

814
00:43:33,412 --> 00:43:34,933
Because that's really offensive.

815
00:43:35,294 --> 00:43:39,377
One of my favorites where you can do that is when the Riddler is insulting you with Batman.

816
00:43:39,978 --> 00:43:45,523
Because he actually teases Batman, but you end up with the ability to skip forward through the Riddler puzzles,

817
00:43:45,944 --> 00:43:48,186
and actually it ends up doing it in quite a respectful way.

818
00:43:48,947 --> 00:43:52,950
But I did see a game that said, like, it looks like you're having trouble.

819
00:43:53,411 --> 00:43:54,672
Yeah, because you designed it bad.

820
00:43:56,654 --> 00:43:57,455
Thanks, Clippy.

821
00:43:57,715 --> 00:43:58,015
Right.

822
00:44:00,293 --> 00:44:03,355
So, one of the other ones that we're going to talk about is one that people often don't

823
00:44:03,375 --> 00:44:06,037
think about, and that's those training options that we were talking about.

824
00:44:06,317 --> 00:44:08,739
And these are places that people can practice and fail.

825
00:44:09,139 --> 00:44:13,682
They're places where people have the opportunity to either practice their skills and develop

826
00:44:13,702 --> 00:44:18,406
them up, or the ability to test out different settings, which is really important for people

827
00:44:18,426 --> 00:44:19,346
with different controllers.

828
00:44:20,851 --> 00:44:23,692
From the drivers, we have not only physical disabilities,

829
00:44:23,732 --> 00:44:25,193
but people who have cognitive disabilities,

830
00:44:25,233 --> 00:44:27,894
or people like me who are just not very good at some games

831
00:44:27,934 --> 00:44:29,434
and need to practice again and again

832
00:44:29,714 --> 00:44:30,935
before they can get the moves down.

833
00:44:30,995 --> 00:44:34,716
Thank you, Street Fighter, which I'm still really bad at.

834
00:44:35,431 --> 00:44:36,111
But it's simply giving...

835
00:44:36,131 --> 00:44:37,072
I still can't play D.Va, don't worry.

836
00:44:37,232 --> 00:44:38,033
Okay, very good.

837
00:44:38,773 --> 00:44:39,554
It does give people...

838
00:44:39,794 --> 00:44:45,118
The solution, though, is to provide people either tutorials or sandbox levels or a variety

839
00:44:45,138 --> 00:44:49,841
of different things that you are far more creative at coming up with than me in order

840
00:44:49,881 --> 00:44:52,543
to allow people to have those areas to practice.

841
00:44:52,843 --> 00:44:57,146
So for example, you have an Assassin's Creed where you can do some different types of things,

842
00:44:57,166 --> 00:44:59,888
which is very different from having an open sandbox level.

843
00:45:00,885 --> 00:45:03,026
Some other really great examples are Rocket League.

844
00:45:03,166 --> 00:45:04,727
I don't know who here's played Rocket League.

845
00:45:05,367 --> 00:45:09,009
It is the most fun, weird little game ever.

846
00:45:09,769 --> 00:45:11,510
It has some beautiful sandbox,

847
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:13,892
and actually AbleGamers uses Rocket League

848
00:45:14,172 --> 00:45:17,213
to train new players on how to use

849
00:45:17,233 --> 00:45:18,294
the controllers that we give.

850
00:45:18,634 --> 00:45:22,157
We have a progression path when you use a quad stick, which is a sip and puff.

851
00:45:22,197 --> 00:45:26,161
It's a very complicated controller designed for people who are quadriplegic.

852
00:45:26,401 --> 00:45:28,623
And you use only your mouth and your breath.

853
00:45:29,203 --> 00:45:32,967
Rocket League is the first game that we master because it teaches you

854
00:45:33,007 --> 00:45:34,108
how to use the controller.

855
00:45:34,468 --> 00:45:36,950
And it has such great training spaces.

856
00:45:39,432 --> 00:45:42,774
Another really good one is Mankind Divided.

857
00:45:43,174 --> 00:45:45,395
They have tutorials for the stealth,

858
00:45:45,695 --> 00:45:47,056
they have tutorials for cover,

859
00:45:47,356 --> 00:45:48,917
and you can bring them up

860
00:45:49,357 --> 00:45:51,718
any time you have to do something again.

861
00:45:51,838 --> 00:45:54,740
So you can go, oh, this is real stealthy,

862
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,021
I need to remember how to do that.

863
00:45:56,241 --> 00:45:58,702
And you can rerun the tutorial right there.

864
00:46:00,727 --> 00:46:05,050
So when we look at these different patterns, the idea is that they link together.

865
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:08,433
They're not a checklist of 22 things that you should run through.

866
00:46:08,993 --> 00:46:12,496
Instead, they're a way to start thinking about your design in a holistic way.

867
00:46:12,876 --> 00:46:16,879
There's something that take accessibility away from the approach of telling you what

868
00:46:16,999 --> 00:46:21,663
to do and what not to do, and instead providing an interlinked language where you can start

869
00:46:21,703 --> 00:46:23,184
having discussions with your teams.

870
00:46:23,744 --> 00:46:27,885
We've seen these used in studios where people bring them in and begin talking about different

871
00:46:27,985 --> 00:46:30,526
aspects of their game, using them for ideation.

872
00:46:30,546 --> 00:46:34,707
One of the most exciting things as a UX designer is to see people putting post-its all over

873
00:46:34,747 --> 00:46:36,868
them, which made me really, really excited.

874
00:46:37,508 --> 00:46:40,909
I did send him a picture and he literally made a giddy girl sound.

875
00:46:40,929 --> 00:46:41,910
I was just like, yay!

876
00:46:42,490 --> 00:46:45,371
And it was really, really fun, because not only were they doing that,

877
00:46:45,391 --> 00:46:47,932
but they were using it as a way to evaluate their own ideas,

878
00:46:48,213 --> 00:46:52,194
where they would see, OK, we think that this solution covers off

879
00:46:52,435 --> 00:46:54,416
all of these different patterns that we see.

880
00:46:54,756 --> 00:46:56,196
Maybe that's not a bad solution,

881
00:46:56,216 --> 00:46:59,178
because it covers a lot of different design problems

882
00:46:59,658 --> 00:47:00,899
that we may run into.

883
00:47:01,719 --> 00:47:04,200
We saw a developer who walked up to a friend and said,

884
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,241
you know, the thing that we're working on,

885
00:47:06,301 --> 00:47:07,902
we have a second channel problem,

886
00:47:07,942 --> 00:47:10,283
because when the thing does that, whatchamacallit,

887
00:47:11,193 --> 00:47:12,874
We're only using sound for that.

888
00:47:13,395 --> 00:47:16,236
And so we talked about the language and things like that.

889
00:47:16,476 --> 00:47:18,397
By just saying, and we went over second channel,

890
00:47:18,417 --> 00:47:20,619
and by saying, hey, we have a second channel problem,

891
00:47:21,459 --> 00:47:24,040
you didn't have to understand the nuances

892
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:25,681
of the disabilities that cover them.

893
00:47:26,122 --> 00:47:28,763
You know what the design pattern talks about

894
00:47:29,143 --> 00:47:31,404
and what you need to do as a solution.

895
00:47:31,965 --> 00:47:34,986
By just saying, hey, we have a second channel problem,

896
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:36,287
and you know what we really need?

897
00:47:36,487 --> 00:47:38,388
We need a way to put a helping hand on that as well.

898
00:47:39,243 --> 00:47:44,388
In that one simple sentence, I've told him volumes about whatever it is we're designing

899
00:47:45,008 --> 00:47:51,174
simply because you now have a tool set in your hands, all of you, that gives you a vocabulary

900
00:47:51,274 --> 00:47:53,276
and a language to share these ideas.

901
00:47:53,757 --> 00:47:58,321
And while it's driven by data from players with disabilities, which is something we're

902
00:47:58,361 --> 00:47:59,062
really proud of.

903
00:47:59,402 --> 00:48:02,144
We've tried to frame it in terms of your language of design.

904
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:04,406
And one of the things that accessibility lacks

905
00:48:04,446 --> 00:48:06,267
across many technology industries,

906
00:48:06,567 --> 00:48:08,548
but most importantly in games, is

907
00:48:08,608 --> 00:48:10,690
we lack that general language that we

908
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:13,592
can take into design sessions and start talking about it.

909
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:15,473
So first of all, the sets of options

910
00:48:15,513 --> 00:48:17,194
that I've discussed here today with Mark,

911
00:48:17,574 --> 00:48:19,355
and also the patterns that we just

912
00:48:19,395 --> 00:48:21,197
had presented with all of the examples,

913
00:48:21,677 --> 00:48:23,518
provide you with that language to begin

914
00:48:23,578 --> 00:48:25,499
having that discussion with your own teams.

915
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,241
So we gave you free stuff.

916
00:48:29,055 --> 00:48:31,856
So I hope that we can bribe you for some good reviews,

917
00:48:31,956 --> 00:48:35,258
but more importantly, I hope you take them to your studios.

918
00:48:35,618 --> 00:48:38,040
If you need more, I highly recommend

919
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:40,641
you come spend some money on ablegamers.org.

920
00:48:41,021 --> 00:48:42,762
Know that everything that we bring in

921
00:48:42,782 --> 00:48:44,063
goes right back to our mission.

922
00:48:44,163 --> 00:48:47,725
So you are really supporting a great cause.

923
00:48:48,025 --> 00:48:49,926
Our cost on them is $4.25,

924
00:48:49,986 --> 00:48:51,587
because we had them printed in the US,

925
00:48:52,267 --> 00:48:55,389
because Chinese New Year fell in a really bad time.

926
00:48:55,409 --> 00:48:56,490
Really awkward time for us.

927
00:48:56,510 --> 00:48:57,070
To get them here.

928
00:48:58,071 --> 00:49:02,494
I do have one more announcement because this is really exciting.

929
00:49:02,554 --> 00:49:07,718
So we know that we're on to something really great here.

930
00:49:07,818 --> 00:49:11,020
And we're announcing, and we have little flyers for anyone who wants one,

931
00:49:11,821 --> 00:49:14,503
that we're doing a certified APX practitioner course.

932
00:49:14,983 --> 00:49:18,165
So in the fall, we are doing a two-day certification,

933
00:49:18,466 --> 00:49:22,749
where we do a really deep dive into how to use APX,

934
00:49:23,169 --> 00:49:26,231
how to bring it into your pipeline, your workflow.

935
00:49:26,872 --> 00:49:31,295
And how to, so the learning objectives are really important, which is how to spot accessibility

936
00:49:31,355 --> 00:49:36,959
issues during design, how to suggest solutions, and most importantly, how to win arguments

937
00:49:37,019 --> 00:49:39,621
with producers who don't want to spend the money to do that.

938
00:49:41,722 --> 00:49:46,646
I feel like the third objective is less and less every day because the industry is really

939
00:49:46,686 --> 00:49:47,567
seeming to wake up.

940
00:49:47,967 --> 00:49:51,090
But I know I still want to arm you with that so that you can win every time.

941
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:55,233
So one of the things that we've talked about quite a lot today is bringing them into your

942
00:49:55,293 --> 00:49:55,694
teams.

943
00:49:56,034 --> 00:49:58,716
If it's training that you want for your teams, we will come to you.

944
00:49:59,157 --> 00:50:03,080
So if you want to have a chat about your studios engaging with training around the APX system,

945
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:06,703
by all means come and talk to us afterwards and we have some flyers for you.

946
00:50:08,364 --> 00:50:10,588
So that's my Corgi.

947
00:50:10,608 --> 00:50:12,873
You can follow her on Instagram at lillybeancorgi.

948
00:50:13,153 --> 00:50:14,375
But any questions?

949
00:50:14,957 --> 00:50:15,758
And thank you guys.

950
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:16,419
Thank you.

951
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:19,745
Dude, 50 right on.

952
00:50:19,786 --> 00:50:20,567
We're perfect.

953
00:50:20,587 --> 00:50:20,767
Boom.

954
00:50:22,277 --> 00:50:26,679
We wanted to be done 10 minutes before and it was literally 50 and 17 seconds.

955
00:50:26,939 --> 00:50:29,740
All right, so you have lots of time for me to ask questions.

956
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,782
One really short one, will your APX course be online?

957
00:50:33,342 --> 00:50:37,084
So at the moment, the way it's going to be designed, it's going to be an in-person two-day

958
00:50:37,224 --> 00:50:37,564
course.

959
00:50:37,624 --> 00:50:42,106
We'll hope to iterate it to be online, but we just can't figure out how to do it right

960
00:50:42,146 --> 00:50:42,266
now.

961
00:50:42,286 --> 00:50:43,207
Where?

962
00:50:43,227 --> 00:50:43,467
Sorry?

963
00:50:43,787 --> 00:50:44,027
Where?

964
00:50:44,919 --> 00:50:45,699
Where is it online?

965
00:50:46,059 --> 00:50:46,660
No, no, no.

966
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:47,821
You said it's going to be in person.

967
00:50:47,881 --> 00:50:48,141
Okay.

968
00:50:48,221 --> 00:50:50,563
So we're working on that all right now.

969
00:50:50,643 --> 00:50:51,824
We're in the process of designing it, of course.

970
00:50:51,844 --> 00:50:57,449
We're hoping next GDC on Monday and Tuesday, we actually hold an APX at a hotel nearby.

971
00:50:57,869 --> 00:51:00,951
But we're also, we'll be holding it at various events.

972
00:51:01,272 --> 00:51:04,734
And if we start seeing clusters, we'll go ahead and start getting rooms and stuff like

973
00:51:04,754 --> 00:51:04,915
that.

974
00:51:05,235 --> 00:51:06,216
We're still working that out.

975
00:51:06,236 --> 00:51:07,096
We're a tiny charity.

976
00:51:07,116 --> 00:51:07,837
We're doing our best.

977
00:51:07,917 --> 00:51:10,459
So most importantly, the studios at the moment, we've had an

978
00:51:10,499 --> 00:51:13,260
And that's a great deal of interest of people wanting to train their teams.

979
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:14,960
Because they want to be...

980
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:19,321
We're seeing a major shift in the industry, and maybe you're all seeing it as well, of

981
00:51:19,422 --> 00:51:22,182
people wanting accessibility buy-in across a team.

982
00:51:22,682 --> 00:51:26,744
So while accessibility specialists, no doubt, will still continue to be important in the

983
00:51:26,784 --> 00:51:29,424
industry, we want everyone having a buy-in.

984
00:51:29,564 --> 00:51:32,885
And so we're seeing a lot more people coming to us, and that's probably where we're going

985
00:51:32,905 --> 00:51:35,426
to be delivering in the autumn, is in studios.

986
00:51:36,128 --> 00:51:38,309
Okay, so the second one is a bit longer.

987
00:51:39,090 --> 00:51:42,472
I find that the dev teams that I work with, because I work in community,

988
00:51:42,972 --> 00:51:46,334
the dev teams I've worked with, they're actually pretty open to accessibility

989
00:51:46,354 --> 00:51:48,916
and they've made changes mid-stride, God bless them.

990
00:51:49,637 --> 00:51:52,819
Where I'm seeing some of the challenges is amongst the players themselves.

991
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:54,640
Why should people have an easy way?

992
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,341
This is supposed to be a challenge.

993
00:51:56,761 --> 00:51:59,903
Why do I have to do it the hard way and other people can just skip to the end?

994
00:52:00,364 --> 00:52:04,768
Now, I know how I handle it, but I'd really like for you to share how you guys would suggest

995
00:52:04,808 --> 00:52:05,068
handling it.

996
00:52:05,088 --> 00:52:07,090
I suspect you and I handle it the same way.

997
00:52:08,871 --> 00:52:09,752
I use rude words.

998
00:52:10,273 --> 00:52:10,913
Well, then we do.

999
00:52:10,953 --> 00:52:11,914
We absolutely do.

1000
00:52:11,934 --> 00:52:13,475
We do it exactly the same way.

1001
00:52:13,555 --> 00:52:15,777
So I don't ban people because I don't have that power.

1002
00:52:15,838 --> 00:52:16,658
You never gave it to me.

1003
00:52:17,159 --> 00:52:22,043
So the reality is, look, I bought the game and I'm playing the game.

1004
00:52:22,824 --> 00:52:25,466
If you want to play it really hard, you be you.

1005
00:52:25,907 --> 00:52:26,387
I don't care.

1006
00:52:27,239 --> 00:52:31,243
And if we find that argument is happening within design teams, it's one of the reasons

1007
00:52:31,263 --> 00:52:33,145
that we talk about challenge as part of this.

1008
00:52:33,606 --> 00:52:36,449
Because it's about tuning experience for an individual.

1009
00:52:36,909 --> 00:52:40,593
And they can tune their own experience and have the experience that they want to have.

1010
00:52:41,034 --> 00:52:43,296
Because it's not about making it easy.

1011
00:52:43,877 --> 00:52:47,439
It's about making it often challenging for themselves,

1012
00:52:47,479 --> 00:52:48,459
but not impossible.

1013
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:51,061
So we often talk about the challenge patterns

1014
00:52:51,121 --> 00:52:52,602
and the challenge pieces of design

1015
00:52:52,882 --> 00:52:55,784
about moving the impossible to being possible.

1016
00:52:56,264 --> 00:52:58,726
And challenge, like what's hard,

1017
00:52:58,966 --> 00:53:01,628
what's a challenge for you could be completely different

1018
00:53:01,648 --> 00:53:03,769
than what's a challenge for me or a challenge for you.

1019
00:53:04,429 --> 00:53:07,311
So the reality is I tell those players

1020
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:08,752
to just do what my grandma said,

1021
00:53:08,812 --> 00:53:12,194
is mind your own damn business and move on

1022
00:53:12,234 --> 00:53:12,494
because.

1023
00:53:13,328 --> 00:53:17,229
Look, we're never going to solve that problem of like,

1024
00:53:17,509 --> 00:53:19,070
you know, I got every achievement.

1025
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:20,150
Great, you have no friends.

1026
00:53:20,210 --> 00:53:20,590
I get it.

1027
00:53:20,650 --> 00:53:21,010
Move on.

1028
00:53:22,531 --> 00:53:25,412
Other questions before I get snarkier?

1029
00:53:25,432 --> 00:53:27,172
Well, I'm going to sit down.

1030
00:53:27,212 --> 00:53:28,273
You promised you wouldn't.

1031
00:53:28,313 --> 00:53:31,434
I could use some more snark in my day.

1032
00:53:32,054 --> 00:53:35,135
Actually, I make games for kids.

1033
00:53:35,175 --> 00:53:37,556
And I was wondering, when you guys were developing this,

1034
00:53:37,596 --> 00:53:39,316
what kind of age ranges were you working with?

1035
00:53:39,476 --> 00:53:41,677
And I particularly work with preschool kids,

1036
00:53:41,717 --> 00:53:42,197
which is all.

1037
00:53:43,102 --> 00:53:45,604
So most of our players are over 16.

1038
00:53:46,625 --> 00:53:48,807
So that's the line that we draw.

1039
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:49,628
Most are over 18.

1040
00:53:50,509 --> 00:53:53,092
We actually have a range, and the majority of the players

1041
00:53:53,132 --> 00:53:54,993
in the player panels fit between 18 and 35.

1042
00:53:56,034 --> 00:54:00,739
But we do have players ranging from 16 up to over 65.

1043
00:54:00,819 --> 00:54:02,501
We have a handful of people who are over 65.

1044
00:54:02,541 --> 00:54:03,602
The reason for that is paperwork.

1045
00:54:04,262 --> 00:54:09,146
Part of it's paperwork, part of it's about holding information regarding young people that we don't want to do as a charity.

1046
00:54:10,086 --> 00:54:15,290
And in fact by US law, we're not allowed to hold data for children under 14. Under 13.

1047
00:54:17,251 --> 00:54:23,175
But to that point, like the solutions and the things are still applied to the work that you're doing.

1048
00:54:24,416 --> 00:54:28,459
Your challenges are just very different compared to mainstream.

1049
00:54:29,552 --> 00:54:29,772
Hi.

1050
00:54:30,293 --> 00:54:33,736
I was wondering, since you brought up at one point that you had different information for

1051
00:54:34,416 --> 00:54:39,400
how women might use this or that this is for America or Canada, do you have more intersectional

1052
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:43,063
information about how this affects different diverse groups or different countries?

1053
00:54:43,404 --> 00:54:43,824
So we...

1054
00:54:44,665 --> 00:54:46,546
We've done some analyses around that.

1055
00:54:46,566 --> 00:54:51,348
We primarily focused around disability and assistive technology use.

1056
00:54:51,708 --> 00:54:54,990
And that's where we've tried to detect whether there's any real patterns within the data.

1057
00:54:55,830 --> 00:54:58,511
I've done a variety of different cluster analyses, and it's really messy.

1058
00:54:58,811 --> 00:55:00,272
People are really complex.

1059
00:55:00,732 --> 00:55:03,414
So while we can make some broad statements, such as we did in this,

1060
00:55:03,474 --> 00:55:05,335
regarding the numbers of people that use them,

1061
00:55:05,675 --> 00:55:09,697
trying to say there's this type of person that uses these sorts of options

1062
00:55:10,157 --> 00:55:12,158
is not something we can do really cleanly.

1063
00:55:12,878 --> 00:55:15,280
And I really am reluctant to do so as well, in all truth,

1064
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:18,463
because it pulls away from this type of approach

1065
00:55:18,483 --> 00:55:20,945
and pushes us back into different types of buckets

1066
00:55:20,985 --> 00:55:23,187
potentially, which we want to try to avoid.

1067
00:55:23,847 --> 00:55:25,569
Is there any sort of an accessibility issue

1068
00:55:25,589 --> 00:55:28,551
then, though, about people who can afford extra accessibility

1069
00:55:28,691 --> 00:55:28,731
or?

1070
00:55:30,487 --> 00:55:35,009
That is potentially an issue and that's one of the reasons that our charity gives, our

1071
00:55:35,049 --> 00:55:38,512
primary mission is getting people into the game and we provide grants to players with

1072
00:55:38,532 --> 00:55:42,534
disabilities to be able to buy the equipment they need because those are serious issues,

1073
00:55:42,554 --> 00:55:44,055
especially around purchasing equipment.

1074
00:55:44,375 --> 00:55:46,636
So please donate to AbleGamers, that would be fantastic.

1075
00:55:47,937 --> 00:55:53,761
But we also don't collect any information around things like income or employment or

1076
00:55:53,801 --> 00:55:54,341
things like that.

1077
00:55:54,581 --> 00:55:56,102
We primarily focus around gameplay.

1078
00:55:57,764 --> 00:56:00,566
Any other questions, anyone?

1079
00:56:02,088 --> 00:56:02,848
Awesome, we did it.

1080
00:56:03,008 --> 00:56:03,869
We did it, I'm getting better.

1081
00:56:03,889 --> 00:56:05,630
Thank you guys so much, we appreciate it.
