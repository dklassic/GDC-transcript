1
00:00:05,624 --> 00:00:06,805
All right, I think it's 10 o'clock.

2
00:00:06,805 --> 00:00:09,349
Good morning, everybody.

3
00:00:09,349 --> 00:00:13,175
Welcome to the producer boot camp.

4
00:00:13,175 --> 00:00:16,140
Some housekeeping things first.

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,383
So, please be sure to silence your cell phones.

6
00:00:19,567 --> 00:00:21,408
Make sure to fill out the evaluations afterward.

7
00:00:21,408 --> 00:00:23,728
Those are actually super useful for us

8
00:00:23,728 --> 00:00:25,509
when speaking to calibrate and make sure

9
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:28,130
that people get the most out of the talks as they can.

10
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:30,270
I'm gonna put up at the end of my talk,

11
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:31,891
I'm gonna put my email address up.

12
00:00:31,891 --> 00:00:33,551
You don't need to take pictures of the slides.

13
00:00:33,551 --> 00:00:34,852
If you email me, I will send them to you.

14
00:00:34,852 --> 00:00:36,612
I'll send you a PDF with my notes and everything.

15
00:00:36,612 --> 00:00:39,573
So don't bother taking pictures.

16
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:43,634
And I'm gonna leave a bunch of time for Q&A at the end.

17
00:00:43,634 --> 00:00:47,275
So, you know, keep track of any questions you wanna ask.

18
00:00:47,275 --> 00:00:49,176
All right, I'm gonna go ahead and start.

19
00:00:51,169 --> 00:00:53,511
So this is the producer bootcamp.

20
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:57,633
My name's Ruth Temandl and I've been a producer,

21
00:00:57,633 --> 00:01:00,375
project manager, program manager in games

22
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:03,476
and game adjacent technologies for about 16 years.

23
00:01:03,476 --> 00:01:04,917
And I've kind of developed over time

24
00:01:04,917 --> 00:01:06,939
this love-hate relationship with ambiguity.

25
00:01:06,939 --> 00:01:11,741
I wanna talk about today why there's so much ambiguity

26
00:01:11,741 --> 00:01:15,584
in game development, what kinds of problems it can cause

27
00:01:15,584 --> 00:01:17,945
and what you as producers can do about it.

28
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:22,012
So to start with, I'd like to know how many people here

29
00:01:22,012 --> 00:01:23,673
are currently a producer on a video game?

30
00:01:23,673 --> 00:01:26,074
Oh, lots of you, awesome, all right.

31
00:01:26,074 --> 00:01:29,416
And then how many of you are game developers

32
00:01:29,416 --> 00:01:29,836
but not producers?

33
00:01:29,836 --> 00:01:31,618
And then how many of you are students

34
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:34,739
who want to get into game development or production?

35
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:35,120
Cool, okay, awesome.

36
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,062
So to start with, I'm gonna define some things.

37
00:01:39,062 --> 00:01:41,604
I'm gonna say the word ambiguity a lot in this talk,

38
00:01:41,604 --> 00:01:45,046
so I wanna make sure that it's clear what I'm talking about.

39
00:01:47,076 --> 00:01:50,378
Ambiguity is when you don't have enough information

40
00:01:50,378 --> 00:01:51,659
to make good decisions.

41
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:53,700
And it's different from risk.

42
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,300
Here's how.

43
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:54,961
So when you bet $100 on a coin flip,

44
00:01:54,961 --> 00:01:56,922
that's taking a risk.

45
00:01:56,922 --> 00:01:58,703
You have a ton of information.

46
00:01:58,703 --> 00:02:01,065
You know how many possible outcomes there are.

47
00:02:01,065 --> 00:02:03,806
You know the approximate odds of those outcomes.

48
00:02:03,806 --> 00:02:07,208
And you know what's gonna happen to you in either outcome.

49
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:09,630
You're either gonna win $100 or you're gonna lose $100

50
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,031
and there's about a 50-50 chance of that happening.

51
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,912
Now humans love risk.

52
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,792
We cannot get enough of it.

53
00:02:15,792 --> 00:02:18,534
There is, you know, there's billion dollar casino industries

54
00:02:18,534 --> 00:02:20,455
built around how much we completely love this.

55
00:02:20,455 --> 00:02:22,797
Like we love taking risks and taking chances

56
00:02:22,797 --> 00:02:24,498
when we know approximately the odds

57
00:02:24,498 --> 00:02:25,418
on what's gonna happen to us.

58
00:02:27,317 --> 00:02:31,600
Unfortunately, ambiguity is like betting $100 on

59
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,820
if I roll the dice in this cup,

60
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,542
are they gonna add up to at least 20?

61
00:02:34,542 --> 00:02:36,503
You have very little information

62
00:02:36,503 --> 00:02:37,544
on which to base that decision.

63
00:02:37,544 --> 00:02:38,885
You don't know how many dice I have

64
00:02:38,885 --> 00:02:41,366
or how many sides they have or what numbers are on them.

65
00:02:41,366 --> 00:02:42,867
You don't even know if I have dice in this cup at all.

66
00:02:42,867 --> 00:02:45,869
So you really don't have enough information

67
00:02:45,869 --> 00:02:47,210
to make that decision confidently.

68
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:50,372
Now, as much as humans love risk and seek it out,

69
00:02:50,372 --> 00:02:52,434
we avoid ambiguity.

70
00:02:52,434 --> 00:02:53,515
We really don't like it.

71
00:02:53,515 --> 00:02:54,635
It makes us uncomfortable.

72
00:02:54,635 --> 00:02:56,156
It makes us unhappy and nervous.

73
00:02:57,107 --> 00:03:00,448
And unfortunately, in game development,

74
00:03:00,448 --> 00:03:03,028
almost every decision we make is that kind of

75
00:03:03,028 --> 00:03:04,429
ambiguous decision where we really

76
00:03:04,429 --> 00:03:05,429
don't have enough information.

77
00:03:05,429 --> 00:03:08,030
If you're trying to decide whether to include

78
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,230
multiplayer in your game, for example,

79
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,491
you don't know how much time and energy

80
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:13,371
that's gonna cost you.

81
00:03:13,371 --> 00:03:15,551
You don't know how many bugs it's gonna introduce.

82
00:03:15,551 --> 00:03:17,072
You don't know if it's gonna be good or not,

83
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:18,252
or if it's gonna be better or worse

84
00:03:18,252 --> 00:03:19,912
than the single player mode of your game.

85
00:03:20,532 --> 00:03:22,193
Maybe players will love it, maybe they'll hate it,

86
00:03:22,193 --> 00:03:23,454
maybe it'll raise your Metacritic,

87
00:03:23,454 --> 00:03:24,274
maybe it'll lower it, right?

88
00:03:24,274 --> 00:03:26,615
There's tons of possible outcomes

89
00:03:26,615 --> 00:03:28,476
and you really don't have a lot of information

90
00:03:28,476 --> 00:03:31,417
to use to predict how likely each of those outcomes are

91
00:03:31,417 --> 00:03:34,579
and you don't necessarily know what's gonna happen

92
00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:36,520
to you or your studio in any of those possible outcomes.

93
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,122
So ambiguity is really stressful.

94
00:03:40,122 --> 00:03:41,762
We don't like it, we try to avoid it,

95
00:03:41,762 --> 00:03:44,143
but in game development, we deal with it constantly.

96
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:50,771
And not only is ambiguity scary and uncomfortable,

97
00:03:50,771 --> 00:03:54,153
to ship your game, you have to make all the decisions

98
00:03:54,153 --> 00:03:56,035
and get rid of all of the ambiguity.

99
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:58,196
You can't ship a game with anything TBD, right?

100
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,918
When you ship a game, you have made every single decision

101
00:04:00,918 --> 00:04:03,600
and you've decided every single aspect of every feature,

102
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,702
every character, every single thing in your game.

103
00:04:06,702 --> 00:04:09,123
Even in live games, if you're doing regular releases,

104
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:11,064
you have to decide every single aspect

105
00:04:11,064 --> 00:04:13,586
of every single thing that goes into each release, right?

106
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,048
So you can only ship when all of the ambiguity is gone.

107
00:04:18,343 --> 00:04:23,305
How many people here are working on a project that's super straightforward and well understood

108
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:26,386
with basically no ambiguity?

109
00:04:26,386 --> 00:04:27,366
Oh, one person.

110
00:04:27,366 --> 00:04:28,767
Okay, awesome.

111
00:04:28,767 --> 00:04:28,967
Yeah.

112
00:04:28,967 --> 00:04:34,529
Since 2001, I've worked at seven studios, I've shipped a dozen games, and I've worked

113
00:04:34,529 --> 00:04:35,609
on a project like that once.

114
00:04:37,038 --> 00:04:39,079
And that makes sense because most of us

115
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,900
get into game development because we wanna innovate,

116
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,481
right, we wanna make awesome new things.

117
00:04:42,481 --> 00:04:44,482
And when you're innovating is exactly

118
00:04:44,482 --> 00:04:45,743
when you have the most ambiguity

119
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:47,064
because you're doing something new,

120
00:04:47,064 --> 00:04:49,446
so the information about how to make your decisions

121
00:04:49,446 --> 00:04:50,426
really doesn't exist yet.

122
00:04:50,426 --> 00:04:51,807
You are creating that information.

123
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:57,930
The other time there's lots of ambiguity is when we're personally doing something that we've never done before

124
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:02,591
Which is also when we're growing the most and learning the most ourselves and becoming better game developers, right?

125
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:07,813
So we're we're again we're dealing with us all the time and especially those of us working in VR

126
00:05:07,813 --> 00:05:13,574
There's tons of ambiguity there because nobody even knows yet like what good VR games are or anything about it, right?

127
00:05:13,574 --> 00:05:18,215
So tons and tons of ambiguity and okay, how many people here are working on a really ambiguous game?

128
00:05:18,215 --> 00:05:19,375
We have tons of unknowns to deal with

129
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,101
Yeah, so you're all in good company.

130
00:05:25,101 --> 00:05:26,561
All right, let's talk about why that's hard.

131
00:05:26,561 --> 00:05:29,121
You know, it's hard to make good decisions

132
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:31,162
when you just don't know what's going to happen.

133
00:05:31,162 --> 00:05:34,402
And there are a lot of things that are unknown

134
00:05:34,402 --> 00:05:35,763
when you're making a game.

135
00:05:35,763 --> 00:05:36,743
Some of them you can control

136
00:05:36,743 --> 00:05:37,923
and some of them you really can't, right?

137
00:05:37,923 --> 00:05:39,784
So first of all, like what is your game?

138
00:05:39,784 --> 00:05:41,284
What game are you making?

139
00:05:41,284 --> 00:05:42,084
What's it gonna be like?

140
00:05:42,084 --> 00:05:43,444
What is the vision for your game?

141
00:05:43,444 --> 00:05:44,705
A lot of times that's super ambiguous.

142
00:05:46,411 --> 00:05:47,512
And then how do you make it?

143
00:05:47,512 --> 00:05:48,874
Like how do you execute on that vision

144
00:05:48,874 --> 00:05:50,916
and what's going to actually happen

145
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,378
when you sit down and start making this game?

146
00:05:52,378 --> 00:05:55,762
And then even things like team roles and team organization,

147
00:05:55,762 --> 00:05:58,445
like who's responsible for what on your project,

148
00:05:58,445 --> 00:05:59,306
who's in charge of what,

149
00:05:59,306 --> 00:06:00,607
and who gets to make which decisions.

150
00:06:00,607 --> 00:06:01,728
That can be super ambiguous.

151
00:06:03,705 --> 00:06:05,145
And then things you don't have control over,

152
00:06:05,145 --> 00:06:06,245
like your partner's decisions.

153
00:06:06,245 --> 00:06:08,506
Maybe your publisher decides tomorrow morning

154
00:06:08,506 --> 00:06:10,166
that they really hate first-person shooters now.

155
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:10,446
Who knows?

156
00:06:10,446 --> 00:06:12,267
Anything could happen, right?

157
00:06:12,267 --> 00:06:14,867
And again, you don't know the possible outcomes

158
00:06:14,867 --> 00:06:17,428
or necessarily what's gonna happen to you and your team

159
00:06:17,428 --> 00:06:20,029
in any of those outcomes.

160
00:06:20,029 --> 00:06:21,009
Market forces.

161
00:06:21,009 --> 00:06:23,630
Maybe a new game comes out

162
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,850
that redefines your genre tomorrow,

163
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,310
and you have to sit down and decide

164
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:29,231
if you're going to redesign your game or not,

165
00:06:29,231 --> 00:06:30,831
again, with very little information

166
00:06:30,831 --> 00:06:31,892
on which to base that decision.

167
00:06:32,962 --> 00:06:34,322
You know, other nasty surprises.

168
00:06:34,322 --> 00:06:36,902
Maybe your studio floods tomorrow and you lose all of your source code.

169
00:06:36,902 --> 00:06:39,363
Maybe your only multiplayer engineer quits.

170
00:06:39,363 --> 00:06:41,243
You can't control a lot of these things.

171
00:06:41,243 --> 00:06:44,504
But as a producer, you have to plan for them and you have to be prepared for them.

172
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:44,584
Okay.

173
00:06:44,584 --> 00:06:45,584
So what can producers do about ambiguity?

174
00:06:45,584 --> 00:06:49,365
In this talk, I want to talk about some of the problems that arise from really ambiguous

175
00:06:49,365 --> 00:06:58,846
situations and what you as the producer can do to either solve these problems or avoid

176
00:06:58,846 --> 00:07:00,607
them before they happen.

177
00:07:01,597 --> 00:07:08,060
Again, because ambiguity is something that all of us are going to face on almost every

178
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:12,302
project, so if you can get really good at dealing gracefully with it, you are going

179
00:07:12,302 --> 00:07:16,024
to be a really valuable producer and a better producer.

180
00:07:16,024 --> 00:07:19,225
So as a producer, your job is to make sure the right work gets done.

181
00:07:19,225 --> 00:07:19,905
Okay?

182
00:07:19,905 --> 00:07:21,686
This is basic project management.

183
00:07:21,686 --> 00:07:24,227
Make sure that the right work is getting done.

184
00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:31,212
The number one thing that my team looks for when hiring project managers is the ability

185
00:07:31,212 --> 00:07:32,773
to deal gracefully with ambiguity.

186
00:07:32,773 --> 00:07:36,555
Because as producers, there's a lot of things that we can do to manage this uncertainty.

187
00:07:36,555 --> 00:07:39,096
And really, it's kind of the core of our job.

188
00:07:39,096 --> 00:07:41,758
Because this is what your job is as a producer, right?

189
00:07:41,758 --> 00:07:45,580
So prioritization, you know, if you're trying to make sure the right work gets done, you

190
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,541
need to make sure that your team knows what the right work is.

191
00:07:49,357 --> 00:07:55,038
Driving decisions, making sure that the right work is defined when it needs to be, and gathering the information that people need to define

192
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:56,018
which is the right work.

193
00:07:56,018 --> 00:08:02,000
Scheduling and tasking, communicating what the right work is to people, making sure that everyone knows who's doing it, and

194
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,141
making sure that the things are getting, you know, that are being worked on when they need to be.

195
00:08:07,141 --> 00:08:11,942
And then owning deadlines, so making sure that work gets done, and making sure everyone understands what done means.

196
00:08:13,497 --> 00:08:14,377
So this is your job.

197
00:08:14,377 --> 00:08:16,317
Now, on super ambiguous projects,

198
00:08:16,317 --> 00:08:19,518
you can get into this kind of worst case scenario state

199
00:08:19,518 --> 00:08:24,199
where your job becomes something that's much harder to do.

200
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:26,240
Prioritization turns into kind of wild guesses

201
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,960
where everything's constantly changing all the time.

202
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,261
Driving decisions, you just hear,

203
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,201
let me think about it some more from everybody,

204
00:08:33,201 --> 00:08:34,081
and they just won't decide.

205
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:35,042
Scheduling and tasking, you're like,

206
00:08:35,042 --> 00:08:36,522
someone should really do something,

207
00:08:36,522 --> 00:08:37,722
we're not getting anywhere.

208
00:08:37,722 --> 00:08:40,983
You make a schedule, and three weeks later,

209
00:08:40,983 --> 00:08:42,743
it just looks like a total fantasy.

210
00:08:43,939 --> 00:08:46,360
And then owning deadlines becomes like,

211
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,440
hey, we passed feature complete four weeks ago

212
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,001
and I don't think we're feature complete at all.

213
00:08:50,001 --> 00:08:51,741
Multiplayer doesn't work.

214
00:08:51,741 --> 00:08:53,902
Someone should probably do something about it.

215
00:08:53,902 --> 00:09:00,264
This is sad because this is not a good situation.

216
00:09:00,264 --> 00:09:01,284
It's really hard to deal with.

217
00:09:01,284 --> 00:09:03,705
And one of the hardest things about it

218
00:09:03,705 --> 00:09:05,405
is often in this situation,

219
00:09:05,405 --> 00:09:07,566
you don't really know if it's a problem

220
00:09:07,566 --> 00:09:10,507
or if you just don't know how to deal with it.

221
00:09:10,507 --> 00:09:12,168
So you don't know if you're the crazy person

222
00:09:12,168 --> 00:09:13,088
or if everyone else is crazy.

223
00:09:14,342 --> 00:09:16,644
And sometimes everyone else on your team

224
00:09:16,644 --> 00:09:17,624
thinks this is fine.

225
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:19,606
Your creative director is having a blast

226
00:09:19,606 --> 00:09:20,947
coming up with cool new features

227
00:09:20,947 --> 00:09:23,369
that they want to put in the game.

228
00:09:23,369 --> 00:09:24,270
And they tell you, making a great game

229
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,311
is way more important than hitting

230
00:09:25,311 --> 00:09:27,653
some arbitrary milestone, right?

231
00:09:27,653 --> 00:09:29,154
And your engineers are like,

232
00:09:29,154 --> 00:09:31,916
other game studios do it this way.

233
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:33,197
They just make great games

234
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:34,759
and they don't even have producers.

235
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:35,720
I would much rather work there.

236
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,520
They don't have producers.

237
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,681
They just listen to their engineers

238
00:09:37,681 --> 00:09:38,842
and they make awesome games.

239
00:09:39,142 --> 00:09:40,963
And isn't that really the important thing?

240
00:09:40,963 --> 00:09:43,264
So are you turning into one of those

241
00:09:43,264 --> 00:09:45,565
like super process heavy producers

242
00:09:45,565 --> 00:09:47,665
that can only like make a schedule and follow it

243
00:09:47,665 --> 00:09:49,566
and isn't gonna make a great game?

244
00:09:49,566 --> 00:09:50,406
Like, how do you know?

245
00:09:50,406 --> 00:09:51,126
And really the question is,

246
00:09:51,126 --> 00:09:54,488
is it okay if things are ambiguous on your project right now?

247
00:09:54,488 --> 00:09:56,468
And of course it depends, it depends on a lot of things.

248
00:09:56,468 --> 00:09:59,249
So first of all, where is the ambiguity?

249
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:09,721
To successfully make a game, you have to have a core vision of a game that you want to make,

250
00:10:09,721 --> 00:10:13,342
and then you use that vision to drive all those thousands of execution decisions that

251
00:10:13,342 --> 00:10:14,762
you have to make over the course of your development.

252
00:10:14,762 --> 00:10:20,084
The higher level a decision is, the more of your project it affects, the more important

253
00:10:20,084 --> 00:10:23,325
is that that decision get made and made early.

254
00:10:23,325 --> 00:10:27,206
You have to get rid of any ambiguity in your game's vision as early as possible.

255
00:10:27,986 --> 00:10:31,648
If you don't have a clear, well-defined, and well-understood vision for your game,

256
00:10:31,648 --> 00:10:33,590
you should do that first. That should be your top priority.

257
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:36,431
And really, nothing else I'm going to talk about matters if you don't have that.

258
00:10:36,431 --> 00:10:41,515
If you haven't already, I really encourage everyone who's a producer

259
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:44,416
to read the Game Outcomes Project. It was a series of articles.

260
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:47,658
I'll link to it in the notes. It was published a couple of years ago.

261
00:10:48,264 --> 00:10:52,427
Paul Tozer and his team surveyed hundreds of game developers and they asked them questions

262
00:10:52,427 --> 00:10:56,951
about their process, how they made decisions on their team, how their team was structured,

263
00:10:56,951 --> 00:11:00,674
a bunch of different questions, and then they correlated the answers to those questions

264
00:11:00,674 --> 00:11:05,458
against the success of the finished games. And not just Metacritic, but Return on Investment

265
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:11,263
and how well that game met the expectations of the development team themselves. And what they found...

266
00:11:11,768 --> 00:11:13,790
was that the strongest correlating factor

267
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:17,892
to a successful game was a viable, compelling, clear,

268
00:11:17,892 --> 00:11:19,814
and well-communicated shared vision.

269
00:11:19,814 --> 00:11:23,236
Games that had this were successful,

270
00:11:23,236 --> 00:11:25,557
and games that didn't have this were not successful.

271
00:11:25,557 --> 00:11:28,679
So if you don't have this clear, strong, agreed-on vision

272
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:31,221
for your game, then you need to get one.

273
00:11:31,221 --> 00:11:33,142
As a producer, that is your top job.

274
00:11:33,142 --> 00:11:34,923
If you do have one, then you can use

275
00:11:34,923 --> 00:11:37,405
it to drive, again, all of those execution decisions

276
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,086
and get rid of the other ambiguity on the project.

277
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:44,523
All right, similarly, ambiguity is less negative

278
00:11:44,523 --> 00:11:47,949
and can even be positive if you're early on in development.

279
00:11:47,949 --> 00:11:49,852
So remember, ambiguity is when you don't

280
00:11:49,852 --> 00:11:50,654
have enough information.

281
00:11:50,654 --> 00:11:52,397
So this is the cone of uncertainty.

282
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:55,661
And early on in a project, there are tons of unknowns

283
00:11:55,661 --> 00:11:56,662
and tons of uncertainty, right?

284
00:11:56,662 --> 00:11:57,683
You don't know what game you're making,

285
00:11:57,683 --> 00:11:59,225
you don't know maybe what engine you're gonna use,

286
00:11:59,225 --> 00:12:00,947
you don't know what the main character will look like.

287
00:12:00,947 --> 00:12:02,989
You have to develop all of that information over time.

288
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:05,992
And then by the time you ship, you know every single thing.

289
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:07,574
Or you've decided everything,

290
00:12:07,574 --> 00:12:09,636
everything is precisely defined.

291
00:12:09,636 --> 00:12:12,279
To get there, you have to drive this cone down over time.

292
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,582
Now, the thing is, this cone does not narrow on its own, right?

293
00:12:15,582 --> 00:12:16,783
It wants to get wider.

294
00:12:16,783 --> 00:12:20,966
People want to play around, they want to innovate, they want to come up with cool new stuff.

295
00:12:20,966 --> 00:12:24,549
But you as the producer have to make sure that the cone is trending in the right direction

296
00:12:24,549 --> 00:12:26,110
so that it gets to zero by the time you ship.

297
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:31,714
And again, if you have time to be in pre-production and, you know, innovate and come up with cool

298
00:12:31,714 --> 00:12:33,576
stuff and try things, then do that.

299
00:12:33,576 --> 00:12:34,776
Like, you know, that's fine.

300
00:12:34,776 --> 00:12:37,859
Just, again, as a producer, you have to keep track of where you are and where things are

301
00:12:37,859 --> 00:12:38,179
trending.

302
00:12:41,122 --> 00:12:44,089
And then third, whether or not ambiguity is a problem

303
00:12:44,089 --> 00:12:45,172
depends on your constraints.

304
00:12:45,172 --> 00:12:46,616
So this is the iron triangle,

305
00:12:46,616 --> 00:12:50,085
and you may have heard of it as fast, cheaper, good, pick two.

306
00:12:51,195 --> 00:12:53,496
But in game development, usually we have to pick all three,

307
00:12:53,496 --> 00:12:54,736
and we have to ship a good game,

308
00:12:54,736 --> 00:12:56,657
and it has to have a bunch of features in it

309
00:12:56,657 --> 00:12:58,017
that the publisher demands or whatever.

310
00:12:58,017 --> 00:13:01,238
So it can be really difficult.

311
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:03,179
And really this iron triangle,

312
00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:05,320
it's a way to think about your constraints.

313
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,041
So the smaller your budget is, the shorter your schedule,

314
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:10,101
and the more features you have to include,

315
00:13:10,101 --> 00:13:12,102
the less room you have for ambiguity,

316
00:13:12,102 --> 00:13:14,343
the less room you have for that innovation and creativity,

317
00:13:14,343 --> 00:13:16,063
and the more you just have to focus on executing.

318
00:13:17,854 --> 00:13:22,197
If, you know, again, if you have all the time and money you need to prototype for three

319
00:13:22,197 --> 00:13:25,679
years and be in pre-production, then, you know, go for it and knock yourselves out.

320
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,841
But if you don't, then you have to really tighten things down.

321
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:32,483
The least ambiguous game I ever worked on was an expansion pack to a sequel.

322
00:13:33,514 --> 00:13:36,156
and the budget was small, the schedule was super tight,

323
00:13:36,156 --> 00:13:38,757
and because it was based on existing games,

324
00:13:38,757 --> 00:13:40,338
we didn't have a lot of room for innovation, right?

325
00:13:40,338 --> 00:13:43,039
We knew a lot about the game we were gonna make.

326
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,200
So we just executed, and it went really well.

327
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,501
You know, it wasn't the most innovative game ever,

328
00:13:46,501 --> 00:13:47,722
but it was fine, and we were able to, you know,

329
00:13:47,722 --> 00:13:49,823
keep the ambiguity really low and just execute.

330
00:13:49,823 --> 00:13:51,024
And then finally, ambiguity is a problem

331
00:13:51,024 --> 00:13:51,784
if it's causing problems on your project.

332
00:13:59,768 --> 00:14:02,789
So I'm going to talk about five kind of major problems

333
00:14:02,789 --> 00:14:04,070
that can result from too much ambiguity.

334
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:08,731
And I'm going to talk about them and give you some tools

335
00:14:08,731 --> 00:14:10,252
that you can use to either, again,

336
00:14:10,252 --> 00:14:13,073
avoid these problems or fix them.

337
00:14:13,073 --> 00:14:15,573
So first of all, churning without progress.

338
00:14:15,573 --> 00:14:17,754
This is when you have too much ambiguity

339
00:14:17,754 --> 00:14:21,195
to be able to actually make real progress on your game.

340
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:22,435
No matter how hard you work,

341
00:14:22,435 --> 00:14:23,096
it just kind of feels like

342
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:24,036
you're not really getting anywhere.

343
00:14:25,882 --> 00:14:27,422
And second, feature creep.

344
00:14:27,422 --> 00:14:28,823
You don't really know what your game is,

345
00:14:28,823 --> 00:14:30,064
so you just kind of add more stuff,

346
00:14:30,064 --> 00:14:30,964
hoping that you'll make it better.

347
00:14:30,964 --> 00:14:31,425
And then team anxiety.

348
00:14:31,425 --> 00:14:32,365
Your team is afraid of what might happen

349
00:14:32,365 --> 00:14:35,587
because they can't really predict outcomes,

350
00:14:35,587 --> 00:14:38,649
so they get kind of nervous and anxious

351
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:40,550
and they aren't able to do their best work.

352
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,150
Conflict and resentment.

353
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,131
You feel like the ambiguity is somebody's fault,

354
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,992
so you have to blame somebody.

355
00:14:44,992 --> 00:14:48,294
Obviously, it's not my fault because I'm doing my best,

356
00:14:48,294 --> 00:14:50,936
so it must be somebody's fault.

357
00:14:52,489 --> 00:14:53,749
And then indecision.

358
00:14:53,749 --> 00:14:57,850
You don't have enough information to make good decisions, so you just don't make them.

359
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:01,751
So obviously most of the time the problems aren't going to be as clear as I'm going to

360
00:15:01,751 --> 00:15:03,032
lay them out here.

361
00:15:03,032 --> 00:15:05,632
They're not going to be super clear cut.

362
00:15:05,632 --> 00:15:12,554
But again, even the best well-managed projects with super clear goals are going to run into

363
00:15:12,554 --> 00:15:16,635
some ambiguity that's going to make your team maybe start churning or start getting anxious.

364
00:15:17,409 --> 00:15:22,554
And sometimes these are small isolated problems that are easy to fix but sometimes if they're

365
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:25,857
not addressed, they can grow into big giant major problems that will destroy your team.

366
00:15:25,857 --> 00:15:30,662
So let's go over some things that you as a producer can do to fix these problems before

367
00:15:30,662 --> 00:15:31,223
they get that big.

368
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:36,512
All right, so churning without progress

369
00:15:36,512 --> 00:15:39,735
is probably the most damaging result of ambiguity, right?

370
00:15:39,735 --> 00:15:42,318
So this is when you're doing a bunch of things,

371
00:15:42,318 --> 00:15:43,879
but you're not really getting anywhere.

372
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:44,920
And this is usually, again,

373
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,622
because your vision isn't clear enough

374
00:15:46,622 --> 00:15:48,444
to know if you're really driving toward it or not,

375
00:15:48,444 --> 00:15:49,886
or if you're getting closer to your vision or not.

376
00:15:49,886 --> 00:15:52,228
So here are some problems to watch for.

377
00:15:52,228 --> 00:15:54,490
First of all, if your game isn't changing.

378
00:15:55,483 --> 00:15:57,964
Maybe you have weekly design reviews or regular reviews

379
00:15:57,964 --> 00:16:00,045
where you look at the game and it's not really changing,

380
00:16:00,045 --> 00:16:01,246
it's not any different.

381
00:16:01,246 --> 00:16:03,046
People are playing on their phones during design reviews

382
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:05,867
because there's just nothing interesting happening.

383
00:16:05,867 --> 00:16:07,508
Or your milestones slip.

384
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:08,308
People can't really tell you

385
00:16:08,308 --> 00:16:09,309
when they're gonna get something done

386
00:16:09,309 --> 00:16:10,649
because they're kind of blocked by something

387
00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:11,390
they can't really define.

388
00:16:14,243 --> 00:16:19,665
Rat-holing or bike-shedding, these are both jargon terms for focusing on a small problem

389
00:16:19,665 --> 00:16:23,487
that's easy to fix while ignoring a gigantic problem that's hard to fix.

390
00:16:23,487 --> 00:16:27,789
So you haven't decided which engine you're going to use yet, but you have these giant

391
00:16:27,789 --> 00:16:29,890
epic reply-all email threads about which font to use.

392
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:32,992
That's a much easier problem and something people really like focusing on and diving

393
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:36,633
into because they just want to really not think about the fact that there's this huge

394
00:16:36,633 --> 00:16:37,594
problem they haven't fixed yet.

395
00:16:37,594 --> 00:16:39,415
Go to Beadaholique.com for all of your beading supply needs!

396
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:43,752
And last, you know, throwing away work.

397
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:46,414
So, I was a level designer on a game

398
00:16:46,414 --> 00:16:48,976
where the level design team was pumping out levels

399
00:16:48,976 --> 00:16:50,857
like clockwork, so each of us were making

400
00:16:50,857 --> 00:16:52,038
three levels every three weeks.

401
00:16:52,038 --> 00:16:54,260
And they were good levels, like we were doing good work,

402
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,582
you know, we were having an okay time,

403
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:58,343
we were delivering very regularly,

404
00:16:58,343 --> 00:17:01,966
but the story for the game wasn't written yet at all.

405
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:03,975
the monster behaviors weren't defined.

406
00:17:03,975 --> 00:17:06,437
There were tons of things about the game

407
00:17:06,437 --> 00:17:08,078
that nobody knew yet.

408
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:10,480
So, you know, everything we were

409
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,542
doing was basically destined to be thrown away.

410
00:17:12,542 --> 00:17:14,523
The other problem was

411
00:17:14,523 --> 00:17:15,925
of the levels we were making, two out of

412
00:17:15,925 --> 00:17:18,166
every three of them were rejected by the lead designer

413
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:19,948
as like, no, this isn't really what I'm thinking.

414
00:17:19,948 --> 00:17:21,189
So, we were

415
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:24,191
completely spinning our wheels. We were doing

416
00:17:24,191 --> 00:17:26,353
our best, but it wasn't really going

417
00:17:26,353 --> 00:17:28,615
anywhere, and ultimately all of that work was thrown away.

418
00:17:30,207 --> 00:17:32,209
Remember that people don't get into game development

419
00:17:32,209 --> 00:17:33,450
because they're lazy, right?

420
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:34,651
They get into game development because they

421
00:17:34,651 --> 00:17:36,272
want to make awesome things.

422
00:17:36,272 --> 00:17:37,013
And they will do that.

423
00:17:37,013 --> 00:17:38,194
Even if you don't have your clear vision

424
00:17:38,194 --> 00:17:39,615
that they can work towards,

425
00:17:39,615 --> 00:17:41,917
they're going to do their best to do good work.

426
00:17:41,917 --> 00:17:43,978
And throwing that work away is a huge waste

427
00:17:43,978 --> 00:17:45,359
and it's really demoralizing.

428
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:47,181
So you shouldn't do it.

429
00:17:47,181 --> 00:17:49,603
Here's what you can do as a producer to fix that situation.

430
00:17:49,603 --> 00:17:52,385
So again, I'm going to say this over and over

431
00:17:52,385 --> 00:17:54,827
and over and over, drive towards a clear vision.

432
00:17:55,671 --> 00:17:59,578
Remember that the one thing that will help your team be successful is to have a strong, clear vision.

433
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,943
And if you don't have that, make that your top priority.

434
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,741
Now second, if you do have a clear vision for your game,

435
00:18:05,741 --> 00:18:07,322
but you still feel like your team is kind of spinning

436
00:18:07,322 --> 00:18:09,502
their wheels and not really getting anywhere,

437
00:18:09,502 --> 00:18:12,984
you know, maybe set shorter term goals or prototype goals

438
00:18:12,984 --> 00:18:16,045
to where your team can get in the habit of finishing things

439
00:18:16,045 --> 00:18:16,985
and where you can build something

440
00:18:16,985 --> 00:18:18,325
that you can really play test.

441
00:18:18,325 --> 00:18:20,546
So, you know, let's say you build a vertical slice,

442
00:18:20,546 --> 00:18:22,327
which is where you sort of try to build something

443
00:18:22,327 --> 00:18:24,067
that reflects your final game vision

444
00:18:24,067 --> 00:18:25,988
to the point where it's playable.

445
00:18:25,988 --> 00:18:27,548
And then your team can play it and find out,

446
00:18:27,548 --> 00:18:29,049
okay, what is really good about this?

447
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:30,609
What's the strengths of our game vision?

448
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:31,790
What are the things that players

449
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,030
are gonna really fall in love with?

450
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:36,611
And then also, what are the things that took up a bunch of time and effort but that really

451
00:18:36,611 --> 00:18:37,752
aren't that good?

452
00:18:37,752 --> 00:18:41,653
Maybe we should cut those things and focus on the things that are awesome.

453
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:46,935
And then third, is your team exploring cool, innovative ideas during pre-production?

454
00:18:46,935 --> 00:18:47,955
You know, that's fine.

455
00:18:47,955 --> 00:18:50,696
Or are they totally lost in the woods?

456
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:55,078
Remember that the difference between exploring and being lost is that if you're exploring,

457
00:18:55,078 --> 00:18:58,399
you're going towards something and you can kind of tell if you're getting closer to it.

458
00:18:58,399 --> 00:19:01,360
But if you're just lost, you're lost and you're not really getting anywhere.

459
00:19:02,277 --> 00:19:08,265
Again, if you have the time and money to be lost for a little while, that can be really useful.

460
00:19:08,265 --> 00:19:09,807
But if you don't, make sure that you're not.

461
00:19:09,807 --> 00:19:09,987
And then

462
00:19:14,123 --> 00:19:17,424
If you're kind of churning, but it looks like it might be temporary and you're not really

463
00:19:17,424 --> 00:19:19,805
sure, you can do something called time boxing.

464
00:19:19,805 --> 00:19:23,245
And that's where you say, okay, we don't know yet if we're going to do multiplayer, we're

465
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:27,666
trying some things, we're doing some prototypes, but if we haven't decided by May, then we

466
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,847
should really start worrying because our schedule is not going to let us spend any more time

467
00:19:30,847 --> 00:19:31,907
on this, right?

468
00:19:31,907 --> 00:19:34,828
Or even if your team is reluctant, or if you don't want to bring that up to your team,

469
00:19:34,828 --> 00:19:37,088
maybe just internally yourself as the producer.

470
00:19:37,589 --> 00:19:40,191
You can say, okay, if we haven't decided by May,

471
00:19:40,191 --> 00:19:42,193
I'm personally gonna start worrying and freaking out

472
00:19:42,193 --> 00:19:43,375
and raising this to people, right?

473
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:46,097
I'm gonna raise some flags if we haven't decided this

474
00:19:46,097 --> 00:19:48,259
in two months or whatever.

475
00:19:48,259 --> 00:19:50,822
You know, execution always takes longer than you think,

476
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:52,304
especially if you're doing something new,

477
00:19:52,304 --> 00:19:54,486
which you probably are, so keep that in mind

478
00:19:54,486 --> 00:19:56,608
and just try as a producer to be a little conservative

479
00:19:56,608 --> 00:19:57,128
with your schedule.

480
00:19:59,062 --> 00:20:03,505
And then last, if your team is so stuck that they can't make progress, you can try something

481
00:20:03,505 --> 00:20:03,766
drastic.

482
00:20:03,766 --> 00:20:08,610
So I don't know how many of you are familiar with Scrum, but Scrum is a project management

483
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:11,752
system that was developed specifically to unstick stuck teams.

484
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:16,437
I think people use it a little too much, probably more than they should.

485
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:20,200
But, if your team is super stuck, it might be worth trying something like that.

486
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,864
Just change up the way you do your process, change up the way you schedule or track work

487
00:20:24,864 --> 00:20:25,745
or something like that.

488
00:20:25,745 --> 00:20:28,507
If you're having daily stand-ups, maybe change to weekly or something.

489
00:20:28,507 --> 00:20:32,110
Try changing things so that maybe it kicks your team out of their deadlock.

490
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:34,933
But again, the most important thing is having a clear vision.

491
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:41,118
So I'm going to talk about a tool for developing and protecting that game vision.

492
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:45,282
Okay, so these are pillars.

493
00:20:45,282 --> 00:20:47,803
I made these up, so they're not very good.

494
00:20:47,803 --> 00:20:50,244
So this is a sample pillars for a made up game.

495
00:20:50,244 --> 00:20:53,906
The player is a powerful commander of a dragon army.

496
00:20:53,906 --> 00:20:57,047
Players can battle their armies while waiting for the bus.

497
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,988
And players use their huge inventory of magic items

498
00:20:58,988 --> 00:20:59,668
to power up their dragons.

499
00:21:00,445 --> 00:21:02,606
Okay, so again, not the best pillars ever,

500
00:21:02,606 --> 00:21:05,067
but reading them, you can envision

501
00:21:05,067 --> 00:21:06,107
what this game would be like, right?

502
00:21:06,107 --> 00:21:07,728
And if you're working on this game,

503
00:21:07,728 --> 00:21:09,729
you can kind of use these as a yardstick

504
00:21:09,729 --> 00:21:11,489
to think about the work you're doing, right?

505
00:21:11,489 --> 00:21:12,850
If you're working on the UI

506
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:14,530
for giving your dragons commands,

507
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:16,451
that's really important, that supports the top pillar.

508
00:21:16,451 --> 00:21:20,373
If you're working on customizable dragon houses, right,

509
00:21:20,373 --> 00:21:22,073
that doesn't really support any of the pillars,

510
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:24,714
it's probably extraneous and you don't need to do it.

511
00:21:24,714 --> 00:21:26,655
So pillars are kind of like a distillation

512
00:21:26,655 --> 00:21:29,376
of your entire design doc into a couple of bullets.

513
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:31,027
and they're easy to communicate,

514
00:21:31,027 --> 00:21:33,289
they're easy for your team to remember and understand,

515
00:21:33,289 --> 00:21:35,590
and you can kind of use them as a ruler

516
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:36,751
for the work that you're doing.

517
00:21:36,751 --> 00:21:39,052
They're also kind of like a pitch, right?

518
00:21:39,052 --> 00:21:40,533
If you told someone about these pillars,

519
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:41,754
if you were in an elevator with someone,

520
00:21:41,754 --> 00:21:44,075
you told them this, you would know pretty quickly

521
00:21:44,075 --> 00:21:45,676
if they were excited about the game or not,

522
00:21:45,676 --> 00:21:46,957
what about it excites them,

523
00:21:46,957 --> 00:21:49,278
what are they interested in learning more about, right?

524
00:21:49,278 --> 00:21:51,720
So it's kind of a distillation of what is your game

525
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,880
down into a very short list.

526
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:59,363
I talk about pillars and game vision all the time.

527
00:21:59,363 --> 00:22:03,167
I really can't shut up about them.

528
00:22:03,167 --> 00:22:04,629
And this is why I think that this is so important.

529
00:22:04,629 --> 00:22:09,335
If you want to build a ship, don't drum up people to collect wood and don't assign them

530
00:22:09,335 --> 00:22:13,521
tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea.

531
00:22:15,277 --> 00:22:18,778
I would bet that most people on your team did not get into game development because

532
00:22:18,778 --> 00:22:20,479
they really like following directions.

533
00:22:20,479 --> 00:22:25,422
They get into game development because they long to make amazing, great games.

534
00:22:25,422 --> 00:22:31,224
So make sure you have a vision for a game that your team will long to make and that

535
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:35,687
players will long to play and that your team can believe in and be proud of and pour all

536
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:36,767
of that creative energy into.

537
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,072
Because if you don't, you'll end up with feature creep.

538
00:22:42,072 --> 00:22:45,794
And again, this is where you aren't really sure

539
00:22:45,794 --> 00:22:48,055
what your game is, so you kind of throw in

540
00:22:48,055 --> 00:22:50,737
random cool stuff, hoping that it will be good.

541
00:22:50,737 --> 00:22:51,317
It won't.

542
00:22:51,317 --> 00:22:53,899
It will make it worse.

543
00:22:53,899 --> 00:22:56,581
Or your creative director gets super duper excited

544
00:22:56,581 --> 00:22:57,401
about every new idea.

545
00:22:57,401 --> 00:22:59,923
She comes across and nobody can tell her no.

546
00:22:59,923 --> 00:23:02,044
Or you don't know if you should tell her no or not.

547
00:23:02,044 --> 00:23:03,445
Or what you should say no to.

548
00:23:05,722 --> 00:23:09,684
Or you're halfway through production and your schedule is clearly completely impossible,

549
00:23:09,684 --> 00:23:11,125
but you don't really know what to cut.

550
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:14,186
You don't know which features are going to have the most payoff and which ones are going

551
00:23:14,186 --> 00:23:16,667
to be big risks that end up not being very good.

552
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:22,969
I worked on a really big AAA game that actually had a super clear, strong vision, a great

553
00:23:22,969 --> 00:23:26,991
vision that everyone really loved, but it was a big team.

554
00:23:26,991 --> 00:23:28,272
We hadn't really worked together before.

555
00:23:29,198 --> 00:23:30,960
The leadership was a little bit fractured.

556
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,581
The cost of failure was super high.

557
00:23:32,581 --> 00:23:35,703
There were a lot of stakeholders at the publisher level

558
00:23:35,703 --> 00:23:37,284
that were super invested in the game.

559
00:23:37,284 --> 00:23:40,246
They wanted us to add a bunch of stuff.

560
00:23:40,246 --> 00:23:43,248
You know, we added all these expensive features

561
00:23:43,248 --> 00:23:45,610
to the game that it didn't really need,

562
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:47,411
that cost a ton of time and effort.

563
00:23:47,411 --> 00:23:48,792
And then, you know, we would do these demos

564
00:23:48,792 --> 00:23:50,013
to the stakeholders who wanted them

565
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:51,213
and they would kind of get excited,

566
00:23:51,213 --> 00:23:53,735
but it was just this like total waste of time.

567
00:23:54,721 --> 00:23:56,983
And then the features that were core to the vision of the game,

568
00:23:56,983 --> 00:23:59,484
which again was super good, were getting short-changed

569
00:23:59,484 --> 00:24:01,246
and not really worked on as much.

570
00:24:01,246 --> 00:24:04,368
So, you know, this caused a lot of tension and infighting

571
00:24:04,368 --> 00:24:06,729
and frustration among the team because we could see

572
00:24:06,729 --> 00:24:08,050
that the really cool game we were thinking of

573
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:08,611
just wasn't getting done.

574
00:24:08,611 --> 00:24:09,371
So, what can you do in this situation?

575
00:24:14,921 --> 00:24:18,524
First of all, again, ambiguity is when you don't have enough information to make good

576
00:24:18,524 --> 00:24:19,545
decisions.

577
00:24:19,545 --> 00:24:22,007
So you can reduce ambiguity by getting information.

578
00:24:22,007 --> 00:24:27,231
One way to do that is to get data by sitting down with your team and figuring out how much

579
00:24:27,231 --> 00:24:29,132
each of these features that you want to make are going to cost you.

580
00:24:29,132 --> 00:24:30,673
There's lots of ways to do this.

581
00:24:30,673 --> 00:24:34,536
This is something that's, you know, there's a lot of articles written about.

582
00:24:34,536 --> 00:24:37,139
But you basically sit down with your teams, you list the features you want to do, and

583
00:24:37,139 --> 00:24:40,041
you come up with some way to estimate the cost of each of them.

584
00:24:40,041 --> 00:24:41,462
So it can be man months.

585
00:24:41,862 --> 00:24:43,463
It can be arbitrary made up numbers.

586
00:24:43,463 --> 00:24:45,744
It doesn't really matter.

587
00:24:45,744 --> 00:24:48,204
But if you can estimate and assign some number

588
00:24:48,204 --> 00:24:49,865
to the cost of things, again, it'll

589
00:24:49,865 --> 00:24:53,926
give you a little peek inside this dice cup, which can really

590
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:54,647
help you make decisions.

591
00:24:54,647 --> 00:24:58,468
And then honestly evaluate each feature

592
00:24:58,468 --> 00:24:59,408
against your game vision.

593
00:24:59,408 --> 00:25:01,189
So if you have pillars, or a design doc,

594
00:25:01,189 --> 00:25:05,210
or a vision statement, you can evaluate those features.

595
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:07,311
Do they really support our game vision or not?

596
00:25:07,311 --> 00:25:08,611
Are they extraneous?

597
00:25:08,611 --> 00:25:10,652
Can we cut them and not really lose anything?

598
00:25:12,018 --> 00:25:14,999
And remember that if your constraints are tight, the tighter your constraints, the less

599
00:25:14,999 --> 00:25:16,459
you can afford this extra stuff.

600
00:25:16,459 --> 00:25:19,680
The more you have to focus on really just what do your pillars absolutely need?

601
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:26,202
And then, you know, you can work with your team to rank features based on these two aspects,

602
00:25:26,202 --> 00:25:26,942
cost and value.

603
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:32,003
Be brutally honest about how much this stuff is going to cost and how much you really need

604
00:25:32,003 --> 00:25:32,063
it.

605
00:25:33,371 --> 00:25:38,992
Here's an example of a feature list ranked by benefit to the game, so this could be just

606
00:25:38,992 --> 00:25:43,634
how much it supports the pillars or how good it is, and then secondly by effort, so this

607
00:25:43,634 --> 00:25:47,995
could be man hours, it could be man months, it could be just some arbitrary number, and

608
00:25:47,995 --> 00:25:52,436
then based on those two numbers develop a value, some value estimate for how valuable

609
00:25:52,436 --> 00:25:54,437
is this feature to my game, what's the return on investment?

610
00:25:56,335 --> 00:26:00,276
If you can use this to really generate your priority list,

611
00:26:00,276 --> 00:26:01,437
start at the top and work down,

612
00:26:01,437 --> 00:26:02,617
and then realize, okay, you know what,

613
00:26:02,617 --> 00:26:04,838
these two features, they seem cool,

614
00:26:04,838 --> 00:26:06,739
but they really either don't have a lot of value to the game

615
00:26:06,739 --> 00:26:08,099
or they're just gonna cost us too much.

616
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:09,980
We don't need to do them.

617
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:13,041
Make sure that you have some way to add numbers to things

618
00:26:13,041 --> 00:26:15,102
so that your team can really agree, right?

619
00:26:15,102 --> 00:26:17,023
And again, these numbers do not have to be super precise.

620
00:26:17,023 --> 00:26:18,383
They don't have to accurately reflect

621
00:26:18,383 --> 00:26:20,764
like the exact number of days you're gonna spend on it.

622
00:26:20,764 --> 00:26:22,445
But just having numbers so that you can have

623
00:26:22,445 --> 00:26:23,545
a conversation about it with your team

624
00:26:23,545 --> 00:26:24,526
is gonna be really valuable.

625
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:31,703
There's a GDC 2015 talk about doing this on the Witcher 3, which is super interesting.

626
00:26:31,703 --> 00:26:36,406
I'm going to link to it in the notes and I recommend checking that out if you're interested

627
00:26:36,406 --> 00:26:37,046
in learning more about this.

628
00:26:37,046 --> 00:26:37,326
All right.

629
00:26:37,326 --> 00:26:40,208
So third, team anxiety.

630
00:26:40,208 --> 00:26:46,012
This is when your team just gets overwhelmed by the amount of ambiguity and they get unhappy,

631
00:26:46,012 --> 00:26:49,314
they get negative, or maybe they just kind of give up and stop putting so much effort

632
00:26:49,314 --> 00:26:51,555
in because they feel like their effort isn't going to the right place.

633
00:26:53,265 --> 00:26:54,405
And maybe that's because they don't know

634
00:26:54,405 --> 00:26:55,886
what they're expected to do.

635
00:26:55,886 --> 00:26:58,507
They don't know what success looks like for them.

636
00:26:58,507 --> 00:27:00,649
Maybe this is because your game vision

637
00:27:00,649 --> 00:27:01,589
isn't really clear to them,

638
00:27:01,589 --> 00:27:03,630
so they don't know what they're working towards.

639
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:05,231
Or maybe they don't see how their work

640
00:27:05,231 --> 00:27:06,252
fits into that game vision, right?

641
00:27:06,252 --> 00:27:07,472
Maybe they're working on something

642
00:27:07,472 --> 00:27:10,234
that doesn't really support any of the pillars,

643
00:27:10,234 --> 00:27:10,974
so they don't understand how it fits.

644
00:27:10,974 --> 00:27:13,976
Or maybe they don't believe in your game vision.

645
00:27:13,976 --> 00:27:16,337
Maybe you're working on a game in a genre

646
00:27:16,337 --> 00:27:18,418
they don't respect or like.

647
00:27:18,418 --> 00:27:20,539
Or maybe they don't think the game you're making is good.

648
00:27:22,077 --> 00:27:23,997
Or maybe you or the leads on your team

649
00:27:23,997 --> 00:27:25,638
just don't have credibility,

650
00:27:25,638 --> 00:27:28,079
so that you tell them what the vision for the game is,

651
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:29,600
and that, hey, you're working towards this thing

652
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,261
that's really important, but they just don't believe you.

653
00:27:31,261 --> 00:27:34,782
One of the worst instances of this I ever saw,

654
00:27:34,782 --> 00:27:36,983
so I was on a project that had an enormous amount

655
00:27:36,983 --> 00:27:39,264
of pressure, right, and tons of ambiguity.

656
00:27:39,264 --> 00:27:41,365
The design for the game, the core design,

657
00:27:41,365 --> 00:27:42,745
kept changing really radically,

658
00:27:42,745 --> 00:27:45,086
and that meant that the design team was crunching

659
00:27:45,086 --> 00:27:47,327
to implement these changes into the levels

660
00:27:47,327 --> 00:27:49,468
and catch up with the balance changes

661
00:27:49,468 --> 00:27:51,049
and all the other major changes that were happening.

662
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,943
So everyone was working crazy hours, tempers were high,

663
00:27:55,943 --> 00:27:58,725
stress was super high, people were having shouting matches

664
00:27:58,725 --> 00:28:01,187
on the floor over who wasn't doing their job.

665
00:28:01,187 --> 00:28:05,131
Years long friendships were dissolving, it was a mess.

666
00:28:05,131 --> 00:28:06,972
And in the middle of all of that, we had a team meeting.

667
00:28:06,972 --> 00:28:10,075
And one of the studio heads got up in front of everyone

668
00:28:10,075 --> 00:28:12,577
and said, hey, our plan is great,

669
00:28:12,577 --> 00:28:15,019
if you guys are crunching, it's your own fault

670
00:28:15,019 --> 00:28:15,920
for not planning well enough.

671
00:28:18,267 --> 00:28:21,650
And this happened over 10 years ago,

672
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:24,233
and you can probably tell I'm still pretty upset about it.

673
00:28:24,233 --> 00:28:27,135
That was like a slap in the face, right?

674
00:28:27,135 --> 00:28:28,937
And not only because it was clear

675
00:28:28,937 --> 00:28:31,219
that our hard work wasn't being appreciated and respected,

676
00:28:31,219 --> 00:28:34,382
but also because either they didn't know

677
00:28:34,382 --> 00:28:35,923
we were crunching this hard,

678
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:37,645
in which case we didn't trust them anymore,

679
00:28:37,645 --> 00:28:39,166
we didn't trust their judgment,

680
00:28:39,166 --> 00:28:41,629
or they knew and they just didn't care, right?

681
00:28:41,629 --> 00:28:43,050
And neither of those are great.

682
00:28:43,957 --> 00:28:47,119
Don't do this to your team, please.

683
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:49,200
What can you do?

684
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,683
What do I wish that my producer had done in this situation?

685
00:28:52,683 --> 00:28:54,884
First, be honest about what's happening.

686
00:28:54,884 --> 00:28:56,645
There are problems on your project.

687
00:28:56,645 --> 00:28:59,547
Be honest about them, because you need credibility

688
00:28:59,547 --> 00:29:01,128
with your team, and your team needs

689
00:29:01,128 --> 00:29:03,209
to know that you know what the problems are

690
00:29:03,209 --> 00:29:04,330
and that you're willing to talk about them.

691
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:07,612
If that guy had stood up and said, look,

692
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:08,592
we know you're working long hours.

693
00:29:08,592 --> 00:29:10,754
We know that things are super ambiguous right now,

694
00:29:10,754 --> 00:29:13,155
but we're working on it, and we appreciate what you're doing,

695
00:29:14,107 --> 00:29:16,908
It would have been a very different situation, right?

696
00:29:16,908 --> 00:29:19,490
I would have respected him a lot more,

697
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:22,031
and the team would have been a lot happier.

698
00:29:22,031 --> 00:29:24,573
So just make sure that people's work is appreciated.

699
00:29:24,573 --> 00:29:26,814
Again, lazy people don't become game developers.

700
00:29:26,814 --> 00:29:28,395
People are going to put in a ton of work.

701
00:29:28,395 --> 00:29:29,356
So make sure they know that it's appreciated.

702
00:29:29,356 --> 00:29:30,797
Make sure it actually is appreciated.

703
00:29:30,797 --> 00:29:32,878
And then second, communicate critical information

704
00:29:32,878 --> 00:29:33,358
to your team.

705
00:29:33,358 --> 00:29:35,920
If there's something they need to know to do good work,

706
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,221
make sure they're not the last to know it.

707
00:29:37,221 --> 00:29:39,222
Make sure that they know all the information they need.

708
00:29:39,222 --> 00:29:41,843
Again, ambiguity is when you don't have enough information.

709
00:29:41,843 --> 00:29:43,785
So make sure your team has as much information as possible.

710
00:29:46,924 --> 00:29:49,926
And then, if your team doesn't have trust in your plan,

711
00:29:49,926 --> 00:29:53,629
one way you can build trust is by executing your plan well,

712
00:29:53,629 --> 00:29:56,411
showing your team, look, this plan is working, right?

713
00:29:56,411 --> 00:29:58,673
We're getting closer to the game we want to make.

714
00:29:58,673 --> 00:29:59,614
Things are going well.

715
00:29:59,614 --> 00:30:01,855
The schedule resembles reality, right?

716
00:30:01,855 --> 00:30:03,597
Now, if the plan doesn't work, you have a problem,

717
00:30:03,597 --> 00:30:05,518
and maybe your team is right not to trust it,

718
00:30:05,518 --> 00:30:06,819
and they need to fix it.

719
00:30:06,819 --> 00:30:08,820
But if you have a good plan, execute it well.

720
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:11,002
Be a good, strong producer so your team can rely on you

721
00:30:11,002 --> 00:30:13,884
and the plan and feel some more confidence

722
00:30:13,884 --> 00:30:14,605
in what's going to happen to them.

723
00:30:17,354 --> 00:30:19,915
And then keep your ears open for problems.

724
00:30:19,915 --> 00:30:22,157
Pull on little threads until you find out what's wrong.

725
00:30:22,157 --> 00:30:25,539
Remember that most of us are on teams

726
00:30:25,539 --> 00:30:28,020
full of nice, decent people.

727
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:31,182
Most people do not want to complain or give you bad news.

728
00:30:31,182 --> 00:30:33,183
But to be a good producer, you need that bad news.

729
00:30:33,183 --> 00:30:35,104
You need to be able to know the problems on your team

730
00:30:35,104 --> 00:30:36,405
so that you can fix them.

731
00:30:36,405 --> 00:30:38,185
So if you hear someone complaining about

732
00:30:38,185 --> 00:30:41,267
how a design doesn't know what they're doing or expressing.

733
00:30:41,654 --> 00:30:44,517
a lack of confidence in your overall plan, pull on that.

734
00:30:44,517 --> 00:30:46,600
Find out what's underlying that.

735
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,803
Maybe it's something real that you need to fix.

736
00:30:48,803 --> 00:30:55,390
And then last, work with your team to really assess the risks to your project.

737
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:59,175
Your project is going to have risks and sitting down and really talking them out.

738
00:30:59,778 --> 00:31:02,080
And planning out what you would do if those things happened

739
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,081
is a really valuable exercise.

740
00:31:04,081 --> 00:31:06,463
If you don't have a plan B, you don't really have a plan.

741
00:31:06,463 --> 00:31:09,125
And again, because there's so much ambiguity in game

742
00:31:09,125 --> 00:31:12,327
development, sometimes you need a plan C, D, E, F, et cetera

743
00:31:12,327 --> 00:31:13,368
also.

744
00:31:13,368 --> 00:31:16,550
So here's an example of a risk assessment.

745
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,971
So this is when you sit down with your team

746
00:31:17,971 --> 00:31:19,713
or with your leads if you're on a big team.

747
00:31:20,821 --> 00:31:23,203
And you ask them, what are you afraid about?

748
00:31:23,203 --> 00:31:24,485
Like, what keeps you up at night?

749
00:31:24,485 --> 00:31:25,586
What are you afraid is gonna happen?

750
00:31:25,586 --> 00:31:27,948
And then you list those things, write them down.

751
00:31:27,948 --> 00:31:29,830
And then for each risk,

752
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,391
talk about how likely it is to happen.

753
00:31:31,391 --> 00:31:34,074
And then what impact on your project

754
00:31:34,074 --> 00:31:35,095
would it have if it happened?

755
00:31:35,095 --> 00:31:36,456
How bad would it be if this happened?

756
00:31:36,456 --> 00:31:40,560
So, and then, you know, talk about a mitigation plan.

757
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,941
What could you do if this happened?

758
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:43,063
Or what can you do to prevent it?

759
00:31:44,034 --> 00:31:47,355
Not only is this going to make you feel like you have more control over your lives and

760
00:31:47,355 --> 00:31:50,417
over your situation, but it will actually give you more control over your lives and

761
00:31:50,417 --> 00:31:54,599
your situation because, again, you're developing information, you're creating information so

762
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:56,220
that you have less ambiguity.

763
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:00,283
A lot of publishers require an updated risk assessment like this with every milestone,

764
00:32:00,283 --> 00:32:01,623
and I think that's a really good idea.

765
00:32:01,623 --> 00:32:05,425
I think this is super valuable, and every project, I think, could benefit from this.

766
00:32:05,425 --> 00:32:06,726
Okay, number four, conflict and resentment.

767
00:32:12,456 --> 00:32:16,218
So, nice people are usually good at hiding problems, but sometimes those problems get

768
00:32:16,218 --> 00:32:21,001
so bad and so big that they blow up and, you know, again, cause everything from shouting

769
00:32:21,001 --> 00:32:25,624
matches on the floor or just long-term simmering resentment that makes it harder for your team

770
00:32:25,624 --> 00:32:26,204
to work together.

771
00:32:26,204 --> 00:32:31,507
And usually this is because of that combination of lots of ambiguity and tons of pressure.

772
00:32:31,507 --> 00:32:37,210
People don't behave well in those situations and they're going to want to lash out.

773
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:38,211
It's human nature.

774
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:46,534
Sometimes people on your team may be afraid to bring up ideas or ask questions in meetings

775
00:32:46,534 --> 00:32:52,678
because they're afraid of either being scapegoated, like being seen as the problem, or just that

776
00:32:52,678 --> 00:32:54,579
they won't be respected or listened to.

777
00:32:54,579 --> 00:32:55,660
And maybe that is actually happening.

778
00:32:55,660 --> 00:33:00,303
Maybe people on your team do get thrown under the bus if they're the ones bringing up problems,

779
00:33:00,303 --> 00:33:00,483
right?

780
00:33:02,543 --> 00:33:04,785
And these problems aren't always visible.

781
00:33:04,785 --> 00:33:09,629
Maybe there's just some invisible hidden resentment or fear or bad feelings and they're ready

782
00:33:09,629 --> 00:33:13,632
to erupt at any moment, but you're not really seeing them because, again, people are pretty

783
00:33:13,632 --> 00:33:14,633
good at hiding them.

784
00:33:14,633 --> 00:33:18,656
A friend of mine was a producer on a team that was under a ton of pressure to ship a

785
00:33:18,656 --> 00:33:20,357
launch title.

786
00:33:20,357 --> 00:33:22,459
The publisher's priorities kept changing pretty wildly.

787
00:33:23,324 --> 00:33:25,166
and the team was working super hard.

788
00:33:25,166 --> 00:33:28,208
Now, they did manage to ship, and they shipped a good game.

789
00:33:28,208 --> 00:33:30,250
And it was critically acclaimed, everyone was happy.

790
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:33,072
It was like, okay, that's over, awesome, everything's great.

791
00:33:33,072 --> 00:33:35,334
And then the team did peer reviews.

792
00:33:36,533 --> 00:33:38,754
And all of these huge interpersonal

793
00:33:38,754 --> 00:33:40,656
and team dynamic problems just boiled up

794
00:33:40,656 --> 00:33:42,597
in these peer reviews, kind of out of nowhere.

795
00:33:42,597 --> 00:33:44,558
And the team leadership was like really surprised

796
00:33:44,558 --> 00:33:46,619
they didn't even know that any of this was there

797
00:33:46,619 --> 00:33:48,441
because the team was like a bunch of senior people

798
00:33:48,441 --> 00:33:49,722
who didn't want to rock the boat.

799
00:33:49,722 --> 00:33:52,203
They didn't want to distract from like this huge,

800
00:33:52,203 --> 00:33:53,944
you know, tons of pressure problem

801
00:33:53,944 --> 00:33:55,585
they had to ship this game.

802
00:33:55,585 --> 00:33:58,647
So the leadership also had been hyper-focused on shipping.

803
00:33:58,647 --> 00:34:00,629
So they really hadn't noticed that their team

804
00:34:00,629 --> 00:34:01,689
was completely falling apart

805
00:34:01,689 --> 00:34:03,871
because it was all happening kind of invisibly.

806
00:34:06,297 --> 00:34:09,540
Okay, so what can you do about this to prevent this from happening?

807
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,341
First of all, doing peer reviews earlier.

808
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:16,325
So peer reviews are when you have everyone on your team pick like three to five people

809
00:34:16,325 --> 00:34:19,908
and write a short kind of blurb about, okay, how is this person doing?

810
00:34:19,908 --> 00:34:20,969
What could they do better?

811
00:34:20,969 --> 00:34:22,370
Are there any problems with them?

812
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:26,554
So this is something that you should do if you can.

813
00:34:26,554 --> 00:34:28,455
It's a good way to surface problems.

814
00:34:28,455 --> 00:34:29,416
It is difficult, though.

815
00:34:29,416 --> 00:34:30,697
First of all, it's time consuming.

816
00:34:31,381 --> 00:34:36,683
Second of all, if there are a lot of personal problems on your team, people may not be willing

817
00:34:36,683 --> 00:34:37,884
to attach their name to it.

818
00:34:37,884 --> 00:34:42,586
And third, you know, people do not want to hurt someone else's feelings.

819
00:34:42,586 --> 00:34:45,248
Nobody wants to be mean or raise problems.

820
00:34:45,248 --> 00:34:46,948
Most people don't.

821
00:34:47,509 --> 00:34:50,310
If you do these anonymously, anonymous reporting isn't great either.

822
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:52,070
That can cause some problems too.

823
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:53,390
But it's better than nothing.

824
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:56,751
Like, if you have problems that are so big that no one on your team wants to speak up,

825
00:34:56,751 --> 00:35:00,012
anonymous reporting or anonymous peer reviews may help you find those problems.

826
00:35:00,012 --> 00:35:01,332
And again, they're better than nothing.

827
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:04,912
Another better way, though, is one-on-ones.

828
00:35:04,912 --> 00:35:08,433
So this is when everyone on your team has someone that they trust and respect, that

829
00:35:08,433 --> 00:35:13,214
they talk to regularly, just, you know, the two of them, and they're able to surface problems

830
00:35:13,214 --> 00:35:16,095
and kind of chew over things and develop solutions.

831
00:35:17,685 --> 00:35:20,227
So even if you have a very small team with light management,

832
00:35:20,227 --> 00:35:21,849
it helps to make sure that everyone on your team

833
00:35:21,849 --> 00:35:23,250
has someone that they're talking to regularly,

834
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:27,394
that they can, again, work with them to solve problems

835
00:35:27,394 --> 00:35:28,515
and just raise issues.

836
00:35:28,515 --> 00:35:30,777
And that helps people also feel like they're being heard

837
00:35:30,777 --> 00:35:32,479
and listened to and respected, which is important.

838
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,084
Second, if your team members aren't comfortable speaking out, you need to build psychological

839
00:35:40,084 --> 00:35:41,105
safety on your team.

840
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:43,466
So this is something that Google did.

841
00:35:43,466 --> 00:35:45,128
It's called Project Aristotle.

842
00:35:45,128 --> 00:35:47,790
I'll link to it again in the notes, but you should look it up.

843
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:51,653
Google looked at all of their teams and they looked at which teams performed really well

844
00:35:51,653 --> 00:35:54,015
and were super strong and which teams were underperforming.

845
00:35:54,015 --> 00:35:55,916
And they looked at correlating factors.

846
00:35:57,284 --> 00:36:02,028
And the strongest correlation they found was something they called psychological safety.

847
00:36:02,028 --> 00:36:07,713
And that's when people felt comfortable and safe expressing their feelings and ideas.

848
00:36:07,713 --> 00:36:09,234
Where everyone felt heard and respected.

849
00:36:09,234 --> 00:36:13,738
People didn't feel like they were being dismissed, people weren't being talked over in meetings.

850
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:15,139
This is super, super important.

851
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:18,381
You need to make sure that everyone on your team feels like they can express themselves

852
00:36:18,381 --> 00:36:21,724
without being, you know, disrespected or not listened to.

853
00:36:21,724 --> 00:36:24,026
So one thing you can do as a producer is in meetings.

854
00:36:24,366 --> 00:36:25,948
Make sure people aren't being talked over.

855
00:36:25,948 --> 00:36:27,830
Make sure people are being listened to.

856
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:29,411
Make sure people know that they are respected

857
00:36:29,411 --> 00:36:30,912
and that their ideas are listened to.

858
00:36:30,912 --> 00:36:32,734
This is something that you can do

859
00:36:32,734 --> 00:36:34,896
and it's super, super valuable.

860
00:36:34,896 --> 00:36:38,540
Ask people who don't usually speak up for their input

861
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:41,042
and then really listen to and respect what they have to say.

862
00:36:44,197 --> 00:36:47,439
And then, you know, third, yourself be trustworthy.

863
00:36:47,439 --> 00:36:49,480
So again, especially if there's tons of ambiguity

864
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:52,382
on your project, make sure that there isn't any ambiguity

865
00:36:52,382 --> 00:36:55,523
about you, the producer, personally.

866
00:36:55,523 --> 00:36:57,224
You know, make sure people can trust you.

867
00:36:57,224 --> 00:36:59,406
Do what you say you're going to do

868
00:36:59,406 --> 00:37:00,707
when you say you're going to do it.

869
00:37:00,707 --> 00:37:03,768
This is actually a lot more rare than you might think,

870
00:37:03,768 --> 00:37:05,950
and as a producer, it will make you really, really valuable.

871
00:37:07,586 --> 00:37:10,388
Make sure that the information you're giving your team

872
00:37:10,388 --> 00:37:13,170
matches the information they're hearing other places.

873
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:15,672
Make sure that people can really trust what you say.

874
00:37:15,672 --> 00:37:18,734
And part of that is if you don't know something,

875
00:37:18,734 --> 00:37:19,494
say you don't know it.

876
00:37:19,494 --> 00:37:21,996
Like be comfortable saying, I don't know.

877
00:37:21,996 --> 00:37:23,117
I don't know, but I'll find out, right?

878
00:37:23,117 --> 00:37:24,417
Don't pretend you know something when you don't.

879
00:37:24,417 --> 00:37:25,198
People see through that.

880
00:37:25,198 --> 00:37:27,680
It'll eat away at your credibility

881
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,682
if you pretend you know things that you don't.

882
00:37:30,682 --> 00:37:33,043
And you really need credibility as a producer

883
00:37:33,043 --> 00:37:34,384
to be able to solve any of these problems.

884
00:37:36,833 --> 00:37:40,815
And then last, make sure that the ownership areas of your project are super clear.

885
00:37:40,815 --> 00:37:45,637
You as the producer can't make sure the right work is getting done if you don't know who

886
00:37:45,637 --> 00:37:47,497
is ultimately responsible for that work.

887
00:37:47,497 --> 00:37:53,700
So you should know who owns every single feature or level or character or API integration on

888
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:56,861
your project and really you should be able to sit down and write it down.

889
00:37:56,861 --> 00:37:59,462
So here's an example of an ownership list.

890
00:38:00,613 --> 00:38:04,276
And these can be as detailed or high level as you want,

891
00:38:04,276 --> 00:38:05,817
but if you couldn't right now sit down

892
00:38:05,817 --> 00:38:07,719
and generate this list for your project,

893
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:09,000
then you have a problem as a producer.

894
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,162
You should be able to make this.

895
00:38:11,162 --> 00:38:13,464
Secondly, if you make this list

896
00:38:13,464 --> 00:38:14,625
and it's just like the same name

897
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:16,967
over and over and over and over for everything,

898
00:38:16,967 --> 00:38:19,089
and you don't have a one person project,

899
00:38:19,089 --> 00:38:21,391
then you do have a problem, right?

900
00:38:21,391 --> 00:38:23,092
Anyone who has ownership over something

901
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:25,054
needs to be able to make decisions about it,

902
00:38:25,054 --> 00:38:26,435
and they're responsible for getting it done.

903
00:38:27,643 --> 00:38:32,225
There's no reason to hire really smart and motivated and creative people if you're not

904
00:38:32,225 --> 00:38:36,086
going to give them actual ownership over the work they're doing and control over it.

905
00:38:36,086 --> 00:38:40,688
There are people who just want to follow directions and do what they're told and they're way cheaper

906
00:38:40,688 --> 00:38:41,728
and sometimes easier to manage.

907
00:38:41,728 --> 00:38:42,889
So just hire those people.

908
00:38:42,889 --> 00:38:43,369
Save your money.

909
00:38:43,369 --> 00:38:47,130
If you're not going to give people ownership over their work, don't hire awesome creative

910
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:48,631
people because they'd rather work somewhere else anyway.

911
00:38:48,631 --> 00:38:48,891
All right.

912
00:38:48,891 --> 00:38:49,251
Last, indecision.

913
00:38:53,867 --> 00:38:56,568
So I'm gonna say it again, ambiguity is when you don't

914
00:38:56,568 --> 00:38:58,589
have enough information to make decisions.

915
00:38:58,589 --> 00:39:00,450
So naturally, when there's lots of ambiguity,

916
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:01,650
people are gonna wanna not make decisions

917
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:03,971
because they don't wanna make the wrong decision, right?

918
00:39:03,971 --> 00:39:06,632
But you have to make all of your decisions

919
00:39:06,632 --> 00:39:08,053
to ship your game.

920
00:39:08,053 --> 00:39:10,154
So indecision is gonna keep you from shipping.

921
00:39:10,154 --> 00:39:11,094
And the most common problem is this kind of

922
00:39:11,094 --> 00:39:12,875
unspecified delay.

923
00:39:12,875 --> 00:39:18,517
This is when people want more time to think

924
00:39:18,517 --> 00:39:21,058
before making a decision, but they don't really know

925
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:22,658
how much time that's gonna take.

926
00:39:23,774 --> 00:39:25,796
They might be waiting for inspiration.

927
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:27,638
They might be waiting for something to happen

928
00:39:27,638 --> 00:39:29,520
that could help force them to make the decision,

929
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,422
but they don't really know what it is.

930
00:39:31,422 --> 00:39:35,346
They might be afraid of the consequences of their decision.

931
00:39:35,346 --> 00:39:38,869
So again, if you're working within really tight budget

932
00:39:38,869 --> 00:39:41,072
or schedule or future constraints,

933
00:39:41,072 --> 00:39:42,253
this can be a big problem.

934
00:39:42,253 --> 00:39:45,076
Maybe the person making the decision

935
00:39:45,076 --> 00:39:46,757
isn't really qualified to do it.

936
00:39:47,854 --> 00:39:50,516
So remember the ownership list we were just talking about.

937
00:39:50,516 --> 00:39:53,178
Maybe the person owning art decisions

938
00:39:53,178 --> 00:39:54,198
isn't a very good artist.

939
00:39:54,198 --> 00:39:57,381
Or maybe your lead designer isn't familiar

940
00:39:57,381 --> 00:39:59,322
with the genre you're working in.

941
00:39:59,322 --> 00:40:01,564
Or maybe someone's trying to make engineering decisions

942
00:40:01,564 --> 00:40:03,185
because they were a programmer like 15 years ago,

943
00:40:03,185 --> 00:40:04,326
but they don't really know what they're doing,

944
00:40:04,326 --> 00:40:06,067
and so they kind of just wait until they know

945
00:40:06,067 --> 00:40:09,010
what's the right decision, but they never will.

946
00:40:10,969 --> 00:40:13,452
Or maybe you're lucky and it's hard to make decisions

947
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:16,295
because you just have way too many good options.

948
00:40:16,295 --> 00:40:18,817
Maybe your design vision has eight awesome pillars

949
00:40:18,817 --> 00:40:21,460
and they're all so good that you don't wanna cut any of them.

950
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,122
But you know that you have to to ship,

951
00:40:23,122 --> 00:40:24,043
but you just can't bring yourself

952
00:40:24,043 --> 00:40:26,385
to cut any of these awesome features.

953
00:40:26,385 --> 00:40:28,608
That's not the worst situation in the world to be in,

954
00:40:28,608 --> 00:40:29,869
but it will keep you from shipping

955
00:40:29,869 --> 00:40:30,890
just as much as everything else.

956
00:40:34,412 --> 00:40:38,676
So ironically, I'm on a super ambiguous project right now,

957
00:40:38,676 --> 00:40:40,318
but I don't have to deal with this very much

958
00:40:40,318 --> 00:40:43,241
because my project director has this philosophy

959
00:40:43,241 --> 00:40:45,944
where all decisions are easy.

960
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:47,686
If it's an easy decision, you just make it.

961
00:40:47,686 --> 00:40:49,588
And if it's a hard decision, it's hard

962
00:40:49,588 --> 00:40:51,310
because both options are about equally good,

963
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:51,990
so you just pick one.

964
00:40:55,958 --> 00:41:00,182
Now, I really like this because not only does it make it way easier for me to do my producer

965
00:41:00,182 --> 00:41:05,787
job well, but also because it's kind of this interesting yardstick I can use.

966
00:41:05,787 --> 00:41:08,629
If we're facing a hard decision, like, why is this one hard?

967
00:41:08,629 --> 00:41:13,594
If all decisions are easy, then what's unique about this decision that makes it really hard

968
00:41:13,594 --> 00:41:14,594
to make?

969
00:41:14,594 --> 00:41:15,475
You know, is it...

970
00:41:15,475 --> 00:41:18,978
Why does it not fall into one of those two categories of, like, either it's easy or it's

971
00:41:18,978 --> 00:41:19,719
hard so it's easy?

972
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:24,612
Is it because both options are really good,

973
00:41:24,612 --> 00:41:26,673
and you don't want to let either one go?

974
00:41:26,673 --> 00:41:30,815
Then you as the producer need to drive that decision.

975
00:41:30,815 --> 00:41:32,677
And you can do that with data.

976
00:41:32,677 --> 00:41:34,738
You have to say, look, our schedule dictates,

977
00:41:34,738 --> 00:41:36,239
like the laws of physics dictate

978
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:37,439
that we have to decide this now.

979
00:41:37,439 --> 00:41:38,960
We just have to pick something.

980
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,102
Have data, be really dogged about this.

981
00:41:42,102 --> 00:41:44,063
And again, the more critical this decision is,

982
00:41:44,063 --> 00:41:45,504
the more it's holding up your project,

983
00:41:45,504 --> 00:41:48,046
the more energy you have to put in to make sure it gets made.

984
00:41:50,548 --> 00:41:52,490
Or is it because all possible decisions

985
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:54,171
are really gonna hurt your game or your team?

986
00:41:54,171 --> 00:41:56,453
Maybe all the possible decisions are really bad,

987
00:41:56,453 --> 00:42:00,335
and so the decision maker is just super reluctant, right?

988
00:42:00,335 --> 00:42:04,198
You know, then your risk mitigation plan

989
00:42:04,198 --> 00:42:05,158
can be really helpful.

990
00:42:05,158 --> 00:42:07,240
Is there a way to assign numbers

991
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,801
to how bad these decisions are, right?

992
00:42:08,801 --> 00:42:10,322
If both options are terrible,

993
00:42:10,322 --> 00:42:11,963
maybe one of them is slightly less terrible,

994
00:42:11,963 --> 00:42:14,365
and then you can pick that one.

995
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,306
You know, is there a way to mitigate

996
00:42:16,306 --> 00:42:17,747
one of the, you know, some of the fallout

997
00:42:17,747 --> 00:42:18,588
from one of the options?

998
00:42:19,493 --> 00:42:21,855
And again, it's almost always better

999
00:42:21,855 --> 00:42:24,918
to make the decision early rather than put it off.

1000
00:42:24,918 --> 00:42:27,120
Almost always the longer you put off a decision,

1001
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:27,580
the worse it gets.

1002
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:30,642
Or is it hard because the person making the decision

1003
00:42:30,642 --> 00:42:33,164
just really doesn't have enough expertise in the area

1004
00:42:33,164 --> 00:42:34,886
or enough information to make it, right?

1005
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:37,308
In this case, maybe you either need to change

1006
00:42:37,308 --> 00:42:41,271
who owns that decision or educate yourselves, right?

1007
00:42:41,271 --> 00:42:43,293
Maybe that person can become an expert in this area.

1008
00:42:44,512 --> 00:42:47,876
You can have tools like play tests or competitive analysis,

1009
00:42:47,876 --> 00:42:50,259
like do market research, bring in users,

1010
00:42:50,259 --> 00:42:53,283
have them talk to whoever's making the decision.

1011
00:42:53,283 --> 00:42:56,126
I was on a team where we were working on a game genre

1012
00:42:56,126 --> 00:42:58,089
that the lead designer had never worked in before.

1013
00:42:58,828 --> 00:43:01,349
So we played a bunch of games in that genre together

1014
00:43:01,349 --> 00:43:04,031
and just looked at, OK, what makes these games good?

1015
00:43:04,031 --> 00:43:04,891
What do we like about them?

1016
00:43:04,891 --> 00:43:06,392
What don't we like about them?

1017
00:43:06,392 --> 00:43:08,333
If you're making a kid's puzzle game

1018
00:43:08,333 --> 00:43:11,514
and your lead designer has only done hardcore strategy games,

1019
00:43:11,514 --> 00:43:12,355
bring in some kids.

1020
00:43:12,355 --> 00:43:13,875
Talk to them about what games they like.

1021
00:43:13,875 --> 00:43:15,576
Look at a bunch of kids' puzzle games.

1022
00:43:15,576 --> 00:43:17,477
See what is it about those games that people fall in love with

1023
00:43:17,477 --> 00:43:18,378
and what you can focus on.

1024
00:43:21,627 --> 00:43:24,188
And then last, as a producer, you're in a powerful position

1025
00:43:24,188 --> 00:43:27,049
where you can kind of propose a decision out loud.

1026
00:43:27,049 --> 00:43:29,109
Often as the producer, you're less kind of married

1027
00:43:29,109 --> 00:43:30,090
to the outcome of the decision,

1028
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:32,150
because your goal is to get the game done.

1029
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:34,031
So maybe you can say like, hey, we should do this.

1030
00:43:34,031 --> 00:43:36,111
Sometimes a decision maker just needs to hear someone

1031
00:43:36,111 --> 00:43:37,812
say it out loud and then respond and like,

1032
00:43:37,812 --> 00:43:41,193
oh, I agree with you, or no, I disagree with you.

1033
00:43:41,193 --> 00:43:42,993
Now, be very careful here.

1034
00:43:44,033 --> 00:43:46,594
Because as a producer, your job is not to make decisions,

1035
00:43:46,594 --> 00:43:48,075
it's to get them made.

1036
00:43:48,075 --> 00:43:49,816
I've seen a lot of times where producers

1037
00:43:49,816 --> 00:43:51,477
will kind of try to jump into this gap

1038
00:43:51,477 --> 00:43:54,219
because there's a hole in ownership.

1039
00:43:54,219 --> 00:43:56,620
And it basically doesn't ever work out.

1040
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:58,842
It's kind of a temporary fix.

1041
00:43:58,842 --> 00:44:00,062
It can cause more problems than it solves,

1042
00:44:00,062 --> 00:44:02,384
so be careful with that.

1043
00:44:02,384 --> 00:44:04,245
You should be getting decisions made, though.

1044
00:44:04,245 --> 00:44:04,865
That's your goal.

1045
00:44:04,865 --> 00:44:06,966
So one way you can do that, this is a backlog.

1046
00:44:06,966 --> 00:44:11,049
So basically, you take all the features you want to make,

1047
00:44:11,049 --> 00:44:12,830
and you just put them in a list.

1048
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:13,350
You order them.

1049
00:44:14,092 --> 00:44:16,073
And this is one of the core tenants of Scrum.

1050
00:44:16,073 --> 00:44:19,475
So this backlog actually is from a project I was on,

1051
00:44:19,475 --> 00:44:21,556
which was in the too much good stuff scenario,

1052
00:44:21,556 --> 00:44:23,877
where we just had too many good things we wanted to make.

1053
00:44:23,877 --> 00:44:25,878
Any of them could make our project successful.

1054
00:44:25,878 --> 00:44:26,979
We couldn't really decide.

1055
00:44:26,979 --> 00:44:28,960
So I just listed everything in order.

1056
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,601
And I gave it to the project director,

1057
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:32,282
and I was like, look, reorder this.

1058
00:44:32,282 --> 00:44:33,442
Do whatever you want with this list.

1059
00:44:33,442 --> 00:44:34,643
You own it.

1060
00:44:34,643 --> 00:44:35,764
But it has to have an order.

1061
00:44:35,764 --> 00:44:36,544
It has to be sequential.

1062
00:44:36,544 --> 00:44:37,685
And then we're gonna start at the top,

1063
00:44:37,685 --> 00:44:38,345
and we're gonna work down.

1064
00:44:40,466 --> 00:44:43,827
So if your team just isn't making important decisions,

1065
00:44:43,827 --> 00:44:46,028
starting with a backlog can be really powerful.

1066
00:44:46,028 --> 00:44:48,309
If nothing else, it's gonna force you to confront

1067
00:44:48,309 --> 00:44:52,551
like the sheer quantity of stuff you wanna do,

1068
00:44:52,551 --> 00:44:54,171
and it'll force you to put some things at the top

1069
00:44:54,171 --> 00:44:54,852
and other things at the bottom.

1070
00:44:54,852 --> 00:44:56,632
Okay, so in conclusion, to ship your game,

1071
00:44:56,632 --> 00:45:00,734
you have to recognize ambiguity and you have to reduce it.

1072
00:45:00,734 --> 00:45:03,755
You cannot ship until you've gotten rid

1073
00:45:03,755 --> 00:45:05,456
of all of the ambiguity on your project.

1074
00:45:07,398 --> 00:45:10,940
Second, ambiguity is something that negatively affects all of us,

1075
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:13,341
and the producers who can deal with it effectively

1076
00:45:13,341 --> 00:45:14,021
are going to be the most valuable.

1077
00:45:14,021 --> 00:45:16,642
Your job is to make sure that you have a plan

1078
00:45:16,642 --> 00:45:18,943
that drives down ambiguity at the right time

1079
00:45:18,943 --> 00:45:20,724
and lets you successfully ship a great game.

1080
00:45:20,724 --> 00:45:23,105
And even though ambiguity can cause a bunch of problems on your game,

1081
00:45:23,105 --> 00:45:24,185
you can fix them.

1082
00:45:24,185 --> 00:45:25,866
All right. Thank you so much for coming.

1083
00:45:39,867 --> 00:45:41,289
All right, we have a bunch of time for questions,

1084
00:45:41,289 --> 00:45:44,573
about 15 minutes, and again, email me for slides.

1085
00:45:44,573 --> 00:45:45,975
My last name ends with an L, not an I.

1086
00:45:45,975 --> 00:45:49,560
I've got some resources, so again,

1087
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:52,904
the Game Outcomes Project you should definitely read.

1088
00:45:52,904 --> 00:45:54,606
Gamasutra has a bunch of post-mortems

1089
00:45:54,606 --> 00:45:55,648
that are super valuable.

1090
00:45:56,268 --> 00:46:00,549
There's a blog called Ask a Manager which is more about personnel management than project

1091
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:03,410
management but there's a lot of good stuff on there about team dynamics and helping your

1092
00:46:03,410 --> 00:46:05,671
team deal with problems.

1093
00:46:05,671 --> 00:46:09,772
The GDC Vault has a bunch of good stuff that I'll link to in the notes and then a couple

1094
00:46:09,772 --> 00:46:10,692
of books also.

1095
00:46:10,692 --> 00:46:13,352
And if you have questions, come on up to the microphones.

1096
00:46:20,921 --> 00:46:28,933
My question is, how can producers become subject matter experts in a particular field in order to be more invaluable to the companies they're working for?

1097
00:46:28,933 --> 00:46:36,004
How can producers become, I'm supposed to repeat your question, become subject matter experts and be more valuable to the company?

1098
00:46:36,672 --> 00:46:37,093
Exactly.

1099
00:46:37,093 --> 00:46:41,355
Yeah, I think that's a tough one because on most of the projects I've been on, I have

1100
00:46:41,355 --> 00:46:42,315
not been a subject matter expert.

1101
00:46:42,315 --> 00:46:47,758
So I was on, like the biggest example was I was on a MOBA, right, and I really hate

1102
00:46:47,758 --> 00:46:48,778
MOBAs.

1103
00:46:48,778 --> 00:46:49,959
I do not like playing them.

1104
00:46:49,959 --> 00:46:51,099
I didn't really know much about them.

1105
00:46:51,794 --> 00:46:56,277
But I think it can also be valuable to come to something impartially.

1106
00:46:56,277 --> 00:46:58,739
Because I wasn't super invested in any of the features of the game,

1107
00:46:58,739 --> 00:47:01,541
I think I was able to be a little more just passionate about like,

1108
00:47:01,541 --> 00:47:04,284
hey, you know what? This is contributing to the game design and this isn't.

1109
00:47:04,284 --> 00:47:06,165
You said the game design was about this,

1110
00:47:06,165 --> 00:47:08,167
but you're working on this other feature that doesn't matter.

1111
00:47:08,167 --> 00:47:10,969
I think being able to prioritize well...

1112
00:47:12,306 --> 00:47:15,288
does depend somewhat on being a subject matter expert,

1113
00:47:15,288 --> 00:47:16,428
but not entirely.

1114
00:47:16,428 --> 00:47:18,069
I think as a producer, the most important thing

1115
00:47:18,069 --> 00:47:21,611
is to learn how to learn enough to be useful as a producer

1116
00:47:21,611 --> 00:47:23,712
and not necessarily to know everything there is to know

1117
00:47:23,712 --> 00:47:24,533
about the genre, right?

1118
00:47:24,533 --> 00:47:26,874
I think in some ways, the more you know

1119
00:47:26,874 --> 00:47:29,556
or the more you're kind of engaged with what you're doing,

1120
00:47:29,556 --> 00:47:33,458
sometimes you can be like a less good producer.

1121
00:47:33,458 --> 00:47:35,019
Maybe that's just me.

1122
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:38,181
But I think that kind of dispassionate and objective,

1123
00:47:38,181 --> 00:47:40,182
like, hey, are we getting closer to our goal or not?

1124
00:47:41,222 --> 00:47:45,824
Doesn't require subject matter expertise now. I know a lot of people on smaller projects. They'll have two hats, right?

1125
00:47:45,824 --> 00:47:49,826
They'll be a producer and like lead engineer or they'll be a producer and a level designer or something, right?

1126
00:47:49,826 --> 00:47:52,727
So in that case you definitely do need subject matter expertise

1127
00:47:52,727 --> 00:47:55,589
But you also do have to be able to step back and divorce yourself from it and go like, okay

1128
00:47:55,589 --> 00:47:56,109
You know what right now?

1129
00:47:56,109 --> 00:48:02,412
I have my producer hat on and I'm making decisions based just on like, you know return on investment and

1130
00:48:02,412 --> 00:48:07,474
Value to the game, right? I don't know if that actually answers your question, but that's my personal opinion. Thank you. Yeah

1131
00:48:09,446 --> 00:48:14,730
You had a slide earlier about having team members own certain parts of the project.

1132
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:20,094
Do you have any insight on how you might go about trying to get people to take ownership

1133
00:48:20,094 --> 00:48:21,615
of things that they don't want to?

1134
00:48:21,615 --> 00:48:23,096
That's a good question.

1135
00:48:23,096 --> 00:48:23,536
So, yeah.

1136
00:48:23,536 --> 00:48:27,359
Team ownership and how you get people to take ownership of things when they don't want to.

1137
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:30,281
That's a really tough one.

1138
00:48:30,281 --> 00:48:33,924
Again, I'm on a super ambiguous project right now, and there's a lot of subprojects that

1139
00:48:33,924 --> 00:48:34,625
need to be owned.

1140
00:48:35,242 --> 00:48:38,764
And most of that has been like the project lead

1141
00:48:38,764 --> 00:48:39,945
just sitting down with someone being like,

1142
00:48:39,945 --> 00:48:41,406
look, someone needs to own this.

1143
00:48:41,406 --> 00:48:42,527
Are you in or are you not, right?

1144
00:48:42,527 --> 00:48:43,948
Are you in or out?

1145
00:48:43,948 --> 00:48:46,050
And if they're out, then it's like, okay, you know what?

1146
00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:48,352
Like you don't get to make decisions about this thing, right?

1147
00:48:48,352 --> 00:48:50,814
This more junior person who isn't as good as you

1148
00:48:50,814 --> 00:48:52,135
is willing to take ownership of it.

1149
00:48:52,135 --> 00:48:53,656
They're gonna make the decisions about it.

1150
00:48:53,656 --> 00:48:54,897
And then as the producer,

1151
00:48:54,897 --> 00:48:56,338
like have a structure that backs that up, right?

1152
00:48:56,919 --> 00:49:01,482
It's really difficult to have owners who aren't invested.

1153
00:49:01,482 --> 00:49:04,084
Like those owners really do have to be invested

1154
00:49:04,084 --> 00:49:07,226
in what they're doing and have, like feel ownership over it.

1155
00:49:07,226 --> 00:49:09,288
And if they don't, like they really shouldn't be owning it.

1156
00:49:09,288 --> 00:49:11,410
And yeah, I've been on teams where someone was like,

1157
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:12,811
well, I guess I'm doing the monster design,

1158
00:49:12,811 --> 00:49:13,751
but I don't really care about it.

1159
00:49:13,751 --> 00:49:15,273
Like, I don't like this game, you know?

1160
00:49:15,273 --> 00:49:17,474
It's like, it's probably not gonna work.

1161
00:49:18,315 --> 00:49:20,555
So, you know, yeah, you have a junior designer that's, like,

1162
00:49:20,555 --> 00:49:21,796
super passionate about the monsters,

1163
00:49:21,796 --> 00:49:22,996
like, put them in charge, you know.

1164
00:49:22,996 --> 00:49:26,637
And maybe they won't do, like, as good a job in terms

1165
00:49:26,637 --> 00:49:28,277
of, like, decisions or whatever, but they'll

1166
00:49:28,277 --> 00:49:30,117
have the passion to be able to reevaluate.

1167
00:49:30,117 --> 00:49:31,558
Like, you can always change, or most of the time

1168
00:49:31,558 --> 00:49:32,658
you can change the decisions that you make, right?

1169
00:49:32,658 --> 00:49:34,418
So, you know, at least you do something,

1170
00:49:34,418 --> 00:49:35,999
and then you play it, and you're like, you know what?

1171
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:36,499
This isn't fun.

1172
00:49:36,499 --> 00:49:37,039
It could be better.

1173
00:49:37,039 --> 00:49:39,700
And then during that time, that person's learning more

1174
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:41,820
about being an expert in that area anyway.

1175
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:43,921
So, that's probably how I'd approach it.

1176
00:49:43,921 --> 00:49:45,321
And that's how, again, we're approaching it

1177
00:49:45,321 --> 00:49:46,581
on my current project.

1178
00:49:46,581 --> 00:49:47,862
So, thank you.

1179
00:49:47,862 --> 00:49:48,022
Yeah.

1180
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:51,442
Hello.

1181
00:49:51,442 --> 00:49:56,269
You mentioned one-on-ones, and you mentioned that, like,

1182
00:49:56,269 --> 00:49:56,930
sorry, the...

1183
00:49:56,930 --> 00:50:02,799
Yeah, they're doing construction, so we're still alive.

1184
00:50:04,024 --> 00:50:07,006
Yes, you mentioned people should have someone that they can talk to that they trust.

1185
00:50:07,006 --> 00:50:16,452
In my previous team that I was on, that was the head of the team, but it can be anyone

1186
00:50:16,452 --> 00:50:17,192
on the team?

1187
00:50:17,192 --> 00:50:20,274
How would that work if people go to different people to talk to?

1188
00:50:20,947 --> 00:50:22,288
Yeah, so the question is one-on-ones,

1189
00:50:22,288 --> 00:50:25,411
like does it need to be someone with authority on the team

1190
00:50:25,411 --> 00:50:27,233
or can it just be like anybody, right?

1191
00:50:27,233 --> 00:50:29,194
So I think it is important if you have a one-on-one

1192
00:50:29,194 --> 00:50:30,856
with someone, like, you know, let's say you're like

1193
00:50:30,856 --> 00:50:32,377
a junior level designer, right?

1194
00:50:32,377 --> 00:50:33,538
Having a one-on-one with a different, like,

1195
00:50:33,538 --> 00:50:35,080
junior level designer is probably not gonna be

1196
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:37,322
as valuable as having it with someone who you feel like

1197
00:50:37,322 --> 00:50:39,384
does have kind of some control over the project.

1198
00:50:39,384 --> 00:50:39,724
But...

1199
00:50:42,553 --> 00:50:44,474
Usually people on the team, let's see,

1200
00:50:44,474 --> 00:50:46,175
so I was on a pretty large team

1201
00:50:46,175 --> 00:50:47,816
where we didn't really have any control, right?

1202
00:50:47,816 --> 00:50:48,917
We were under a publisher,

1203
00:50:48,917 --> 00:50:50,678
the publisher was calling all the shots,

1204
00:50:50,678 --> 00:50:53,319
but it still felt like when I had a one-on-one

1205
00:50:53,319 --> 00:50:55,841
with my manager, even though I kind of knew

1206
00:50:55,841 --> 00:50:57,642
they couldn't really do anything about the problems,

1207
00:50:57,642 --> 00:50:59,183
like at least they were listening to me.

1208
00:51:00,046 --> 00:51:04,733
I think it depends less on how much authority the person has necessarily and more on how

1209
00:51:04,733 --> 00:51:06,095
helpful it seems like they're being.

1210
00:51:06,095 --> 00:51:11,502
I don't know if that really answers the question, but the important thing is to be heard and

1211
00:51:11,502 --> 00:51:15,348
feel like you're not alone and someone is sympathizing with you and in the boat with

1212
00:51:15,348 --> 00:51:15,408
you.

1213
00:51:16,329 --> 00:51:19,091
And I know it kind of sucks when you just hear like,

1214
00:51:19,091 --> 00:51:20,692
well, there's nothing I can do about that, you know,

1215
00:51:20,692 --> 00:51:21,672
live with it.

1216
00:51:21,672 --> 00:51:24,054
But, but just like being heard,

1217
00:51:24,054 --> 00:51:25,815
I think is the more important thing sometimes

1218
00:51:25,815 --> 00:51:27,235
than actually even fixing the problems.

1219
00:51:27,235 --> 00:51:28,676
Like there's always gonna be problems,

1220
00:51:28,676 --> 00:51:29,977
you can't fix all of them.

1221
00:51:29,977 --> 00:51:31,838
So having a structure where you can kind of talk about them

1222
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:33,759
and feel like you're working through them

1223
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:35,720
is sometimes kind of more important or as important.

1224
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:35,800
Okay.

1225
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:35,960
Thanks.

1226
00:51:39,358 --> 00:51:43,219
Thanks for sharing all the information and all the insight.

1227
00:51:43,219 --> 00:51:46,020
I have a couple of questions.

1228
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:48,760
You mentioned something about the Witcher 3 talk.

1229
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:50,941
I just wanted to make sure which one it was.

1230
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,461
Is that the Anti-Chamber one?

1231
00:51:52,461 --> 00:51:52,561
No.

1232
00:51:52,561 --> 00:51:53,721
Let's see.

1233
00:51:53,721 --> 00:51:55,182
I don't link to it at the end here.

1234
00:51:55,182 --> 00:51:56,802
Let me see.

1235
00:51:56,802 --> 00:51:57,062
Sorry.

1236
00:51:57,062 --> 00:51:58,982
I will find it.

1237
00:51:58,982 --> 00:52:02,783
The question is which is the Witcher 3 talk about feature ranking?

1238
00:52:02,783 --> 00:52:03,823
Man, I have a lot of slide animations.

1239
00:52:03,823 --> 00:52:04,523
All right.

1240
00:52:04,837 --> 00:52:06,097
Here we go.

1241
00:52:06,097 --> 00:52:12,779
It is called From Great Ideas to Game Features, I think.

1242
00:52:12,779 --> 00:52:14,739
And it was from 2015, and it was by the lead designer

1243
00:52:14,739 --> 00:52:14,919
on Witcher 3.

1244
00:52:14,919 --> 00:52:16,480
And it's in the vault.

1245
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:17,320
And the other one is, what do you

1246
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:18,661
think makes a good game vision?

1247
00:52:18,661 --> 00:52:22,442
Oh, what do I think makes a good game vision?

1248
00:52:22,442 --> 00:52:28,363
I think something where, so good pillars, I think,

1249
00:52:28,363 --> 00:52:31,584
are specific, and actionable, and positive.

1250
00:52:31,584 --> 00:52:31,624
So.

1251
00:52:33,606 --> 00:52:36,348
Examples of good pillars are things like,

1252
00:52:36,348 --> 00:52:39,731
you know, like, you're gonna play as a wolf spirit

1253
00:52:39,731 --> 00:52:41,713
and the game has a Sumi-e art style, right?

1254
00:52:41,713 --> 00:52:43,835
Like, you know exactly which game I'm talking about.

1255
00:52:43,835 --> 00:52:46,037
Or, you know, if you can sort of tell someone

1256
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:49,180
in two sentences what the game is and they get it

1257
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:50,661
and they're on the same wavelength as you

1258
00:52:50,661 --> 00:52:52,483
and they're like, oh, I see where you're going with that.

1259
00:52:53,344 --> 00:52:56,265
I think when you try to tell someone what your game is,

1260
00:52:56,265 --> 00:52:57,887
and you kind of spend a lot of time explaining,

1261
00:52:57,887 --> 00:53:00,768
and they don't really get it, that almost always means

1262
00:53:00,768 --> 00:53:01,989
that you don't really know what you're making,

1263
00:53:01,989 --> 00:53:03,570
or it's not gonna be very good, right?

1264
00:53:03,570 --> 00:53:05,211
Usually when you tell someone, and they get,

1265
00:53:05,211 --> 00:53:06,592
they're like, oh, I see what you're talking about,

1266
00:53:06,592 --> 00:53:07,473
like, I understand, right?

1267
00:53:07,473 --> 00:53:09,874
That's a good game vision,

1268
00:53:09,874 --> 00:53:11,375
is something that gets across to someone,

1269
00:53:11,375 --> 00:53:12,916
and then they kind of like have this spark of like,

1270
00:53:12,916 --> 00:53:15,098
oh, I love what you're saying, right?

1271
00:53:15,098 --> 00:53:17,719
That's, I think if you talk to someone at GDC,

1272
00:53:17,719 --> 00:53:18,600
and you tell them your game vision,

1273
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:19,941
and they get excited, it's a good vision.

1274
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:22,873
Even if it's like, hey, I'm making a Candy Crush clone,

1275
00:53:22,873 --> 00:53:25,175
but instead of candies, it's aliens.

1276
00:53:25,175 --> 00:53:26,917
It's like, oh, OK, I get it.

1277
00:53:26,917 --> 00:53:28,679
It's not the most innovative game,

1278
00:53:28,679 --> 00:53:29,921
but you know what I'm talking about.

1279
00:53:29,921 --> 00:53:30,121
Thanks.

1280
00:53:31,722 --> 00:53:32,022
Hello.

1281
00:53:32,022 --> 00:53:34,222
There's a couple of things that you mentioned

1282
00:53:34,222 --> 00:53:35,662
I wanted you to elaborate on.

1283
00:53:35,662 --> 00:53:38,183
The first one was the iron triangle.

1284
00:53:38,183 --> 00:53:42,103
There's three, the time, quality, cost, pick two.

1285
00:53:42,103 --> 00:53:44,284
And you said in game development we pick three,

1286
00:53:44,284 --> 00:53:46,644
but that's physically impossible.

1287
00:53:46,644 --> 00:53:48,644
So I wanted to elaborate on that.

1288
00:53:48,644 --> 00:53:51,725
And also, why do you feel that Scrum is being used too much?

1289
00:53:51,725 --> 00:53:54,465
So the iron triangle, why do I say

1290
00:53:54,465 --> 00:53:56,066
we have to pick three when it's only physically

1291
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:57,286
possible to pick two?

1292
00:53:57,286 --> 00:53:59,906
And why do I think Scrum is used too much?

1293
00:53:59,906 --> 00:54:00,086
So.

1294
00:54:00,837 --> 00:54:05,401
The Iron Triangle, it's more like how far out each of those corners are, right?

1295
00:54:05,401 --> 00:54:07,363
So it's sort of like, okay, how big is your budget?

1296
00:54:07,363 --> 00:54:08,544
How big is your schedule?

1297
00:54:08,544 --> 00:54:13,369
And how many features are you including is sort of an inverse one, which is weird.

1298
00:54:13,369 --> 00:54:17,512
And then the size of those is kind of how much time you can mess around.

1299
00:54:17,512 --> 00:54:20,755
And and in a way, how innovative your game can be. Right.

1300
00:54:20,755 --> 00:54:22,917
So I don't know if quality is really the word. It's more.

1301
00:54:24,519 --> 00:54:25,119
How innovative.

1302
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:27,201
Yeah, and scope.

1303
00:54:27,201 --> 00:54:28,842
And then if you execute well on all of those,

1304
00:54:28,842 --> 00:54:30,043
then you'll end up with quality.

1305
00:54:30,043 --> 00:54:35,668
You can have a quality game that has to be a racing game sequel

1306
00:54:35,668 --> 00:54:37,129
so all the features are well-defined,

1307
00:54:37,129 --> 00:54:39,311
and you have six months and no money.

1308
00:54:39,311 --> 00:54:41,513
And you can still make a quality game out of that,

1309
00:54:41,513 --> 00:54:42,794
but you can't do any innovation.

1310
00:54:43,635 --> 00:54:47,557
So it's it again. It's like you can't do that and innovate

1311
00:54:47,557 --> 00:54:55,280
But you can do without innovating does that does that make sense because in the triangle quality is usually in the middle

1312
00:54:55,280 --> 00:55:01,523
Yeah, scope so you're saying that you do work with all those you can't fix those though

1313
00:55:01,523 --> 00:55:08,147
That's what when pick two means you fix. Yeah accessory exactly which ones are fixed which ones are adjustable and then how do you have?

1314
00:55:08,147 --> 00:55:09,007
to work within them right

1315
00:55:09,707 --> 00:55:11,088
And then the other thing about Scrum,

1316
00:55:11,088 --> 00:55:13,030
so I know a bunch of game developers

1317
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:15,291
where someone at their studio is like,

1318
00:55:15,291 --> 00:55:17,193
let's do Scrum, I hear it's amazing.

1319
00:55:17,193 --> 00:55:19,455
And the thing is, so another interesting finding

1320
00:55:19,455 --> 00:55:20,996
of the Game Outcomes Project is that

1321
00:55:20,996 --> 00:55:23,718
what project management process you use

1322
00:55:23,718 --> 00:55:25,459
is not really important, or it doesn't really correlate

1323
00:55:25,459 --> 00:55:26,940
to the finished game quality, right?

1324
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:30,243
Scrum, Waterfall, Agile, like whatever, doesn't matter.

1325
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:33,205
What matters is, does your team understand it?

1326
00:55:33,205 --> 00:55:34,125
And are they using it well?

1327
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:36,868
So I think a lot of people look at Scrum and they're like,

1328
00:55:36,868 --> 00:55:38,350
this is gonna change the world, it's gonna be amazing,

1329
00:55:38,350 --> 00:55:39,411
and then everything will be great.

1330
00:55:39,411 --> 00:55:40,272
And it's not, right?

1331
00:55:40,272 --> 00:55:42,435
So they put a bunch of time and effort in,

1332
00:55:42,435 --> 00:55:43,296
they change over to Scrum,

1333
00:55:43,296 --> 00:55:44,617
the team doesn't really understand it,

1334
00:55:44,617 --> 00:55:45,719
and then things get kinda worse

1335
00:55:45,719 --> 00:55:47,241
because the team isn't bought in.

1336
00:55:47,241 --> 00:55:49,463
If your team's bought in, it really does not matter

1337
00:55:49,463 --> 00:55:50,945
what project management process you use,

1338
00:55:50,945 --> 00:55:52,767
as long as you do it well and everybody understands it.

1339
00:55:52,767 --> 00:55:53,708
Right, so that's the important thing.

1340
00:55:53,708 --> 00:55:53,989
Okay, thank you.

1341
00:55:57,779 --> 00:56:03,446
Hello. While working on an ambiguous project, have you ever had to work with developers

1342
00:56:03,446 --> 00:56:08,953
and team members that don't work well with ambiguity? And if so, what would be your advice

1343
00:56:08,953 --> 00:56:09,674
for dealing with that?

1344
00:56:10,482 --> 00:56:14,884
Yeah, so a lot of times when I'm interviewing, I'll ask someone, like, oh, sorry, the question

1345
00:56:14,884 --> 00:56:17,985
is what about people that don't work well with ambiguity, what do you do?

1346
00:56:17,985 --> 00:56:22,428
So one thing is interviewing, just say, like, hey, are you the type of person that likes

1347
00:56:22,428 --> 00:56:24,609
getting handed a list and then just doing the list?

1348
00:56:24,609 --> 00:56:28,231
Or are you the type of person that likes their management to be really hands off and be like,

1349
00:56:28,231 --> 00:56:29,951
hey, there's this problem, figure out how to fix it?

1350
00:56:30,232 --> 00:56:31,473
Right?

1351
00:56:31,473 --> 00:56:34,336
Some people who are game developers just want to be given,

1352
00:56:34,336 --> 00:56:36,659
like, do these 50 things in order

1353
00:56:36,659 --> 00:56:38,080
and just figure out how to do them.

1354
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:41,124
And some people like working that way.

1355
00:56:41,124 --> 00:56:42,825
Those types of people are not gonna do as well

1356
00:56:42,825 --> 00:56:43,967
on a very ambiguous project,

1357
00:56:43,967 --> 00:56:45,588
unless they have a strong lead

1358
00:56:45,588 --> 00:56:47,290
that can kind of shelter them from the ambiguity

1359
00:56:47,290 --> 00:56:48,732
and tell them, like, do this and this and this, right?

1360
00:56:48,732 --> 00:56:50,394
So a lot of it is just hiring the right people

1361
00:56:50,394 --> 00:56:50,934
for your project.

1362
00:56:52,706 --> 00:56:55,788
If you're on a super, super ambiguous project

1363
00:56:55,788 --> 00:56:57,229
and you have people like that,

1364
00:56:57,229 --> 00:56:59,891
you kind of have to protect them a little bit.

1365
00:56:59,891 --> 00:57:02,133
And currently, I'm in research,

1366
00:57:02,133 --> 00:57:03,994
we kind of just don't hire those people

1367
00:57:03,994 --> 00:57:05,515
because we know they're not gonna succeed.

1368
00:57:05,515 --> 00:57:08,838
So it's kind of different on a big team

1369
00:57:08,838 --> 00:57:09,858
where you have a bunch of people

1370
00:57:09,858 --> 00:57:12,520
and you kind of have to hire more junior people

1371
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:14,782
who don't really know how to deal with ambiguity yet.

1372
00:57:14,782 --> 00:57:16,804
But again, make sure that they have someone

1373
00:57:16,804 --> 00:57:17,504
that they can ask.

1374
00:57:17,584 --> 00:57:19,025
Like, hey, what am I supposed to do right now?

1375
00:57:19,025 --> 00:57:19,825
I don't really know.

1376
00:57:19,825 --> 00:57:20,586
I feel bad.

1377
00:57:20,586 --> 00:57:21,586
I'm nervous.

1378
00:57:21,586 --> 00:57:24,087
And have someone that's telling them, OK, here's

1379
00:57:24,087 --> 00:57:25,208
what you need to focus on.

1380
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:26,749
Here's what work you're doing.

1381
00:57:26,749 --> 00:57:28,130
Here's how your work fits into the project.

1382
00:57:28,130 --> 00:57:29,510
Everything's cool.

1383
00:57:29,510 --> 00:57:33,032
So strong leads is, I guess, my answer in two words.

1384
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:33,833
OK, thank you.

1385
00:57:33,833 --> 00:57:36,054
How do you get designers comfortable with time box

1386
00:57:36,054 --> 00:57:37,254
ideation?

1387
00:57:37,254 --> 00:57:41,717
How do you get designers comfortable with time box

1388
00:57:41,717 --> 00:57:42,877
ideation?

1389
00:57:42,877 --> 00:57:45,559
I think data.

1390
00:57:45,559 --> 00:57:45,959
So.

1391
00:57:47,445 --> 00:57:54,655
If you are a producer on a project and your designers just will not work within a time

1392
00:57:54,655 --> 00:57:58,080
box, then kind of all you can do is shove data in their faces.

1393
00:57:58,080 --> 00:57:58,180
Oops.

1394
00:57:58,180 --> 00:57:58,480
Oh, no.

1395
00:57:58,480 --> 00:57:59,301
Sorry.

1396
00:57:59,301 --> 00:58:01,224
I'm trying to flip to my last slide while I'm talking.

1397
00:58:01,224 --> 00:58:02,265
That's not great.

1398
00:58:03,793 --> 00:58:06,615
So if you have data and you're like look, this is our schedule, right?

1399
00:58:06,615 --> 00:58:11,159
We have to ship by Christmas or our studio is getting shut down, right? Just

1400
00:58:11,159 --> 00:58:12,541
Reemphasize that and again

1401
00:58:12,541 --> 00:58:17,765
I think that's where being a producer and being a little more objective and kind of divorced from like but I care so deeply about

1402
00:58:17,765 --> 00:58:21,569
What color the players hair is, you know, like you're like, I don't care. We just have to ship and

1403
00:58:23,515 --> 00:58:29,460
being that person kind of allows your designers a little bit more freedom actually because if your designers are the kind that like want to

1404
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:31,341
iterate on stuff and really want to play around

1405
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:35,944
It's it's good to give them that space and I think you as the producer can kind of be like, okay

1406
00:58:35,944 --> 00:58:39,407
I'll be the one worrying about the schedule you worry about making stuff cool

1407
00:58:39,407 --> 00:58:44,290
And then we'll both contribute and work together and there's like a healthy tension

1408
00:58:44,290 --> 00:58:49,273
I have worked though with designers that just will not right they just won't and those games don't ship

1409
00:58:51,125 --> 00:58:53,947
So update your resume, I guess, is the answer.

1410
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:54,268
Yeah.

1411
00:58:54,268 --> 00:58:55,669
All right.

1412
00:58:55,669 --> 00:58:57,030
How much time?

1413
00:58:57,030 --> 00:58:58,751
Or let's see.

1414
00:58:58,751 --> 00:59:00,312
We've got two minutes.

1415
00:59:00,312 --> 00:59:01,032
All right.

1416
00:59:01,032 --> 00:59:01,633
One minute.

1417
00:59:01,633 --> 00:59:01,733
OK.

1418
00:59:01,733 --> 00:59:01,813
Hi.

1419
00:59:01,813 --> 00:59:03,134
So I had a question.

1420
00:59:03,134 --> 00:59:05,175
In a fairly flat hierarchy, how do you

1421
00:59:05,175 --> 00:59:08,918
get your colleagues to buy into your somewhat

1422
00:59:08,918 --> 00:59:10,259
arbitrary deadlines?

1423
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:15,728
So in a flat hierarchy, how do you get people to buy into arbitrary deadlines?

1424
00:59:15,728 --> 00:59:21,549
Arbitrary deadlines don't really work unless your team is bought in, right?

1425
00:59:21,549 --> 00:59:26,471
So if your team sees the value in, okay, why do we need an arbitrary deadline, then it'll

1426
00:59:26,471 --> 00:59:26,991
work.

1427
00:59:26,991 --> 00:59:31,612
But if they just see you as the producer being this dictatorial, like, for no reason we have

1428
00:59:31,612 --> 00:59:33,912
to hit alpha by March, right?

1429
00:59:34,132 --> 00:59:39,516
Like, they just won't listen to you because your priorities are different.

1430
00:59:39,516 --> 00:59:42,859
They want to make a great game, you want to hit an arbitrary deadline.

1431
00:59:42,859 --> 00:59:47,122
You really have to have this kind of deep understanding of why.

1432
00:59:47,122 --> 00:59:48,963
Why is it important that we finish something?

1433
00:59:49,684 --> 00:59:54,045
Sometimes it's not. I went to a talk yesterday by the guy who did Thumper,

1434
00:59:54,045 --> 00:59:55,826
and they worked on that game for seven years, and he was like,

1435
00:59:55,826 --> 00:59:57,367
we were lost in the woods and it was awesome.

1436
00:59:57,367 --> 01:00:02,069
It's like we had the best time just like trying stuff that didn't work for like five years.

1437
01:00:02,069 --> 01:00:05,770
It's like, okay, like you do you, man, you know, like, but they didn't have anyone telling them

1438
01:00:05,770 --> 01:00:07,631
like, no, you have to ship by next year, you know.

1439
01:00:08,191 --> 01:00:10,131
And sometimes that works.

1440
01:00:10,131 --> 01:00:11,752
And I think if they had had a producer on that project

1441
01:00:11,752 --> 01:00:13,232
that was like, no, you have to finish now,

1442
01:00:13,232 --> 01:00:14,972
it wouldn't have been good, right?

1443
01:00:14,972 --> 01:00:16,132
They would have shipped a game that was bad.

1444
01:00:16,132 --> 01:00:19,313
So it kind of depends on what your constraints are.

1445
01:00:19,313 --> 01:00:21,473
If you don't have schedule constraints,

1446
01:00:21,473 --> 01:00:23,934
then don't have schedule constraints.

1447
01:00:23,934 --> 01:00:25,894
If you do, though, then your team needs to understand

1448
01:00:25,894 --> 01:00:28,355
what those constraints are and why you have them.

1449
01:00:28,355 --> 01:00:28,715
I don't know if that.

1450
01:00:28,715 --> 01:00:29,075
Yes, it does.

1451
01:00:29,075 --> 01:00:29,155
Okay.

1452
01:00:29,155 --> 01:00:29,675
Thanks for the talk.

1453
01:00:29,675 --> 01:00:29,955
All right.

1454
01:00:29,955 --> 01:00:31,255
All right, awesome.

1455
01:00:31,255 --> 01:00:33,135
I'll be hanging around outside a little bit

1456
01:00:33,135 --> 01:00:34,476
if anyone has more questions

1457
01:00:34,476 --> 01:00:36,076
and otherwise enjoy the rest of the bootcamp.

1458
01:00:36,076 --> 01:00:36,276
Thanks.
