00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:03,011
Hi everyone, welcome to the GDC Twitch channel.

2
00:00:03,051 --> 00:00:07,652
My name is Brian Francis, I'm the contributing editor at Gamasutra.com.

3
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:14,693
I am a community manager for GC, and I am here today playing a game called Outer Wild.

4
00:00:15,073 --> 00:00:19,254
Oh no, it's got THE Outer Wild in my overlay, that's embarrassing.

5
00:00:20,314 --> 00:00:22,094
Uh, sorry about that.

6
00:00:23,275 --> 00:00:29,656
Um, I am going- I am not going to be able to fix that for the stream, I am so sorry about that.

7
00:00:33,112 --> 00:00:35,014
Oh, are you set? Yeah, it happens a lot.

8
00:00:35,894 --> 00:00:36,355
Oh boy.

9
00:00:38,797 --> 00:00:42,000
Um, anyway, uh, hi there everyone.

10
00:00:43,273 --> 00:00:48,819
I'm joined today, after my embarrassing mistake, in the lower left-hand corner of the screen

11
00:00:48,919 --> 00:00:51,922
by two wonderful folks from Mobius Digital.

12
00:00:52,122 --> 00:00:54,185
Those folks are Lone Vernell and Wesley Martin.

13
00:00:54,725 --> 00:01:00,771
And also in the lower left-hand corner of the screen is Alex Guaro, who is a content

14
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:03,795
master for GC and also contributing editor at Gamasutra.

15
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:04,535
Alex, how you doing?

16
00:01:05,764 --> 00:01:10,866
Uh, pretty good. I'm sorry I didn't jump in earlier, but I wanted to follow good podcast etiquette and wait until I was introduced.

17
00:01:11,146 --> 00:01:11,367
Yeah.

18
00:01:11,847 --> 00:01:15,149
Uh, yeah, let's, uh, let's talk about this game. This game's real good, right?

19
00:01:15,649 --> 00:01:18,570
We should probably let, um, we should probably let them introduce themselves, I think.

20
00:01:19,471 --> 00:01:20,371
Sure, go ahead.

21
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:24,554
Uh, Wesley, uh, Wesley Lone, could you please introduce yourselves for our guests?

22
00:01:25,614 --> 00:01:27,135
While I figure out where the heck I'm going.

23
00:01:28,176 --> 00:01:30,257
I'm Wesley Martin, art director on Outer Wilds.

24
00:01:31,237 --> 00:01:34,439
And I'm Lone Verneau, designer and producer on Outer Wilds.

25
00:01:35,348 --> 00:01:39,430
Nice. Thank you guys so much for joining us today. Why don't you, I think, you know, most people who

26
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,773
are watching probably know the story, but just in case, can you talk a bit about where the idea

27
00:01:43,793 --> 00:01:51,377
for this game came from and sort of how it came to fruition? Sure, yeah. Outer Wilds was started

28
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,422
over eight years ago now as a student project at USC

29
00:02:01,603 --> 00:02:04,745
and as a thesis project at USC.

30
00:02:05,995 --> 00:02:10,819
And there were a couple of starting goals with it.

31
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,042
One of them was to create a world

32
00:02:15,222 --> 00:02:18,284
that changes over time drastically,

33
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:22,788
like environments that, as you explore them,

34
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:26,851
they change in great ways,

35
00:02:26,911 --> 00:02:28,633
like Thorough Hollow, for example,

36
00:02:28,673 --> 00:02:30,854
which is a planet that falls apart

37
00:02:31,755 --> 00:02:33,616
over the course of the game loop.

38
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:38,392
as it's being bombarded by its volcanic moon.

39
00:02:39,912 --> 00:02:49,355
And then the other goal was to create a game about exploration and like the real, the actual

40
00:02:49,455 --> 00:02:51,476
feeling of real space exploration.

41
00:02:52,596 --> 00:02:59,598
So you know, not going out there and shooting aliens and trading, but the feeling of trying

42
00:02:59,658 --> 00:03:02,979
to understand what's out there, trying to understand.

43
00:03:05,413 --> 00:03:08,474
the laws of nature and how it all works

44
00:03:09,615 --> 00:03:17,720
in a way where we are powerless to these massive galactic forces, right?

45
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:22,342
Oops, I think you're falling down into a black hole.

46
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:24,183
I am, I'm working on it.

47
00:03:25,184 --> 00:03:26,024
No pressure Brian.

48
00:03:26,544 --> 00:03:29,046
Good moment to highlight the powerlessness.

49
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:41,842
That was sort of like how the sort of our goals starting the game and hopefully we achieve some of these.

50
00:03:42,563 --> 00:03:50,687
There's also sort of a third like smaller goal of creating a space exploration game that feels more like real space exploration.

51
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:59,672
Where you know with NASA you're going out there to discover things just because you're curious and not for gain.

52
00:04:00,452 --> 00:04:02,173
And so that was like a huge.

53
00:04:02,866 --> 00:04:07,629
part of designing the story and the mechanics of the game.

54
00:04:29,504 --> 00:04:36,868
If you want to talk about that, I'd be curious to know more what that was like, but also I'm really curious to know, like, what's it like now that it's shipped and released and you've had it out for a few months?

55
00:04:36,888 --> 00:04:38,669
Like, how's it going for you guys?

56
00:04:38,709 --> 00:04:41,550
Like, did it, you know, like, how has it been?

57
00:04:42,931 --> 00:04:46,433
Um, I guess if we do it chronologically.

58
00:04:46,773 --> 00:04:49,995
Yeah, I can, I can briefly go over like the history of the project.

59
00:04:50,615 --> 00:04:53,317
So, you know, it started as the student project was 2013.

60
00:04:53,557 --> 00:04:53,657
Yeah.

61
00:04:53,697 --> 00:04:53,777
And.

62
00:04:57,155 --> 00:05:02,097
Alex and Loan kept working on it for a couple of years, and then IGF was 2015.

63
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:09,161
And right after that, in the summer of 2015, is when they decided to bring it to Mobius Digital,

64
00:05:09,741 --> 00:05:14,564
which is where they both worked at the time. And that's when I got hired on, was like,

65
00:05:14,644 --> 00:05:19,726
okay, we're turning this into a fully-fledged project. And so we hired up on our team and

66
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:23,888
kind of got going. We did a crowdfunding thing.

67
00:05:24,712 --> 00:05:28,234
And that did not give us enough money to last for more than like a year.

68
00:05:28,894 --> 00:05:32,717
And towards the end of that year we struck up a deal with Anapurna.

69
00:05:33,778 --> 00:05:35,579
And they've been wonderful to us ever since.

70
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:40,682
But basically in the course of working with them we were like, you know,

71
00:05:40,822 --> 00:05:43,004
we want to make like the true version of this game.

72
00:05:43,984 --> 00:05:48,267
And so we scrapped a lot of our work at the time and kind of started fresh with the art direction.

73
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:51,189
And really aimed for like making it a...

74
00:05:51,983 --> 00:05:53,503
a fully realized experience.

75
00:05:53,643 --> 00:05:59,745
And so that's what we've been working on for the last four years.

76
00:05:59,765 --> 00:06:04,266
And as you move towards ship, and then shipped it last year on Xbox, and I think on PC and

77
00:06:04,286 --> 00:06:06,566
other platforms as well, how did that go for you?

78
00:06:06,586 --> 00:06:09,427
I was meant to ask, how was the launch?

79
00:06:09,447 --> 00:06:11,208
How was the run up to launch?

80
00:06:11,228 --> 00:06:12,168
Was it what you expected?

81
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,108
Was it harder?

82
00:06:13,128 --> 00:06:13,428
How did it go?

83
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:19,357
First of all, I'll give you a piece of advice.

84
00:06:19,637 --> 00:06:26,779
If you press the jetpack up, there's a prompt telling you how to use the booster.

85
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,341
That will help you significantly in traveling around.

86
00:06:32,361 --> 00:06:34,262
There we go, yeah.

87
00:06:34,382 --> 00:06:35,242
That does help, yeah.

88
00:06:35,522 --> 00:06:38,383
I'm just trying to figure out... I was trying to get somewhere, and now I'm just trying to figure out how to get there.

89
00:06:38,403 --> 00:06:41,905
Anyway, continue. Please, focus on the questions. My terrible gameplay will resolve itself.

90
00:06:42,965 --> 00:06:43,365
It's that.

91
00:06:46,418 --> 00:06:52,163
Yeah, I mean, it was definitely a bit of a challenge to bring it to more platforms.

92
00:06:53,264 --> 00:06:59,770
And we're definitely still working on that right now.

93
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:05,955
But yeah, I mean, it was a lot of work from both the art team and the tech team.

94
00:07:07,257 --> 00:07:11,720
And as I mentioned, we're still working on that side of things.

95
00:07:14,035 --> 00:07:20,479
Because Outer Wilds is such an experimental game, it was never really intended to be brought

96
00:07:20,539 --> 00:07:21,660
to this level of polish.

97
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:27,243
So when we made that decision, like, yeah, we're going to polish this game and make it

98
00:07:27,303 --> 00:07:31,946
like fully presentable and fully realized, there were a lot of things that just weren't

99
00:07:32,146 --> 00:07:38,130
in the game, like streaming assets or, you know, just like when you say functionality

100
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:40,991
that you would expect, because we hadn't needed it up until that point.

101
00:07:42,274 --> 00:07:50,799
There was a lot of back-loaded work where it's like, okay, we need to go in and fix all the bones underneath everything in order for all of it to layer on top correctly.

102
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:59,065
It's a pretty big process for our team and the tech team to go and optimize everything properly and get it into tip-top shape.

103
00:08:00,626 --> 00:08:02,067
Yeah, go ahead, sorry.

104
00:08:02,968 --> 00:08:10,313
Oh, and we faced so many issues that most games don't face just because of the nature of the game being...

105
00:08:11,147 --> 00:08:17,431
a full-fledged physics simulation where whether you're there or not things still happen.

106
00:08:18,672 --> 00:08:23,155
The destruction of Brunel Hollow that you can observe in real time if you're on the

107
00:08:23,195 --> 00:08:24,936
planet still happens if you're not there.

108
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:35,082
If you leave your ship somewhere it might get tossed up by a tornado or destroyed by

109
00:08:35,142 --> 00:08:36,143
a meteor.

110
00:08:36,363 --> 00:08:39,385
Everything is always simulated and as a result.

111
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:46,825
Plus everything is built on spheres, which means creating new tools for that.

112
00:08:48,587 --> 00:08:59,356
It was a lot of challenges that increased in complexity as we increased the quality of the visuals and the amount of content.

113
00:09:00,197 --> 00:09:04,760
Yeah, I can only imagine. Real quick, we should have said at the top of the stream, and as folks filter in and out,

114
00:09:05,758 --> 00:09:08,040
We will absolutely take your questions from chat.

115
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,941
If you have any questions regarding game design and a specific game in general,

116
00:09:11,001 --> 00:09:14,803
please put them in chat and we will harvest the good ones and relay them.

117
00:09:14,823 --> 00:09:17,084
Most of them are good, too.

118
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:18,424
Yeah, because this game is good also.

119
00:09:18,484 --> 00:09:22,406
And I bring that up because this game is sort of is unique and maybe not unique,

120
00:09:22,426 --> 00:09:25,588
but like it's very rare in the fact that most of the game's discoveries

121
00:09:25,628 --> 00:09:26,688
are sort of tied to play.

122
00:09:27,228 --> 00:09:30,110
So, you know, it's not that I think we're going to get in

123
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,730
any kind of spoiler territory here, but like.

124
00:09:32,198 --> 00:09:36,160
The meat of playing this game is the discovery of how everything works, at least in my experience.

125
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:39,741
So, you know, when we talk about things like Brittle Hollow being destroyed,

126
00:09:40,661 --> 00:09:43,061
you know, that's because the whole place gets blown up in 22 minutes also.

127
00:09:44,062 --> 00:09:47,823
So we should actually, let's talk about that real quick. No, let's talk, let's stay on this.

128
00:09:47,863 --> 00:09:51,544
Because I want to talk about the art direction and how you sort of came in,

129
00:09:52,424 --> 00:09:56,305
especially you Wes. Like, you know, one of the most remarkable things about this game in my experience

130
00:09:56,365 --> 00:10:01,107
is the way it models real scientific principles like physics and gravity and that kind of thing.

131
00:10:02,224 --> 00:10:04,986
And also phenomena like black holes and white holes.

132
00:10:05,306 --> 00:10:10,689
And I'm just curious, as you were revamping this game's look and coming at it with a bunch of new

133
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:16,152
tech and art, what, if anything, did you take from real science to try and figure out how to

134
00:10:16,592 --> 00:10:18,934
make these look realistic and striking in the way that they are?

135
00:10:18,954 --> 00:10:25,257
Yeah, that's a good question. It's a lot of complicated things interacting,

136
00:10:25,837 --> 00:10:28,199
but I'll try and sum it up as quickly as possible.

137
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:38,236
Early on we made the decision that like sort of one of the core things that makes Outer Wilds feel like Outer Wilds is that it doesn't lie to the player.

138
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:45,002
And you know, that's a relative term because all video games have to lie on some level.

139
00:10:46,263 --> 00:10:50,707
But like, for example, we don't arbitrarily limit where you can go.

140
00:10:50,727 --> 00:10:53,549
There aren't like invisible barriers or things like that.

141
00:10:53,629 --> 00:10:55,410
It's like if you can see it, you can go there.

142
00:10:57,032 --> 00:10:58,333
And so that was sort of like.

143
00:10:58,644 --> 00:11:03,226
Something that I think made the alpha really special and we didn't want to lose that.

144
00:11:03,346 --> 00:11:07,328
We wanted to make sure that everything in the game felt correct.

145
00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:10,950
Even if it's not actually correct, it needs to feel correct to the player.

146
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,011
It needs to respond in the way you'd expect it to.

147
00:11:13,392 --> 00:11:17,374
You need to be able to test your hypotheses because it's a game about doing science.

148
00:11:17,934 --> 00:11:22,737
And so if it lied to you, then that prevents you from being able to test things and kind of ruins the whole experience.

149
00:11:24,118 --> 00:11:26,919
So that led us to do things like, you know, we tried more...

150
00:11:27,438 --> 00:11:33,920
complex visual styles with higher detail, but then players would either get distracted or we couldn't have accurate collisions

151
00:11:33,961 --> 00:11:38,442
so people couldn't climb on things and it just kind of cheapened the whole feel of everything.

152
00:11:38,462 --> 00:11:43,644
So a lot of the art direction for Outer Wilds was choosing where to use our detail and

153
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:49,067
simplifying everything else so that it focuses players on the things that need to be active.

154
00:11:49,907 --> 00:11:53,308
Right. What's an example of somewhere where you chose to really put a lot of detail?

155
00:11:54,619 --> 00:11:57,621
I'm the village we're right now is actually a very good example.

156
00:11:58,681 --> 00:12:01,483
It's one of the more dense areas in the game in terms of there's a lot of

157
00:12:01,543 --> 00:12:04,084
characters to interact with and a lot of things to learn there.

158
00:12:04,845 --> 00:12:08,847
And so players would just spend hours at the beginning of game of the village,

159
00:12:09,007 --> 00:12:11,649
not even realize it's a space exploration game and you know,

160
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:14,470
give up cause they didn't understand what's going on.

161
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:17,552
And so we had to carefully tune things like the lighting in the village that

162
00:12:17,572 --> 00:12:22,034
like lights are near points of interest. Um, we had to remove excess details.

163
00:12:22,054 --> 00:12:23,335
Thank you.

164
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,171
Ignore me, I goofed.

165
00:12:26,611 --> 00:12:27,191
You're doing great.

166
00:12:27,692 --> 00:12:28,112
Don't worry.

167
00:12:29,533 --> 00:12:32,735
We had some mini-games and things like that that we had to cut because players were just

168
00:12:32,815 --> 00:12:37,279
getting distracted from the important thing, which is learning about space, getting curious

169
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:38,780
about space, and getting launch codes.

170
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,141
And so we had to cut away everything.

171
00:12:41,902 --> 00:12:45,484
And that's also one of the reasons why the game doesn't have enemies that you fight,

172
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:50,028
or things that you collect, is because all of that extra stuff distracts people from

173
00:12:50,468 --> 00:12:51,849
exploring for the sake of knowledge.

174
00:12:52,852 --> 00:12:58,633
Oh, that's interesting. Did the team ever consider putting in collectibles or combat or anything like that?

175
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:03,934
No, that was very early a decision we made.

176
00:13:03,954 --> 00:13:12,736
Because the goal was, on the design side, definitely to create a game where players were driven by curiosity alone.

177
00:13:13,596 --> 00:13:20,518
And so the best way to prove that hypothesis was by removing every other possible rewards.

178
00:13:21,038 --> 00:13:21,278
Right?

179
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:28,468
upgrades if you have, like, collectibles, if you have any of that, players might be

180
00:13:28,528 --> 00:13:30,409
exploring for the sake of finding these.

181
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:38,955
So we, from pretty early in the development process, we decided that the only reward you

182
00:13:38,995 --> 00:13:41,056
would ever get in the game is knowledge.

183
00:13:41,757 --> 00:13:47,920
The only thing, there's no upgrades, there's no tools, new tools you get to unlock or whatever,

184
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,842
the only thing you gain is knowledge.

185
00:13:51,286 --> 00:13:54,251
And sort of our base for the game.

186
00:14:04,821 --> 00:14:09,104
This whole game feels finely tuned in a way that I kind of struggle to comprehend.

187
00:14:09,764 --> 00:14:14,908
From the macro scale of the 22 minute loop, to the way that different planets have different

188
00:14:14,948 --> 00:14:16,849
gravity scales and different movement speeds.

189
00:14:16,909 --> 00:14:19,871
And actually like, as you play this game and play the loop over and over, you start to

190
00:14:19,891 --> 00:14:22,533
realize that at certain points in time, certain things will happen.

191
00:14:22,973 --> 00:14:25,835
And you need to be there to see it or to do something about it.

192
00:14:26,135 --> 00:14:27,776
And all of that I imagine must have been like...

193
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:32,631
At least haphazardly planned and timed out, if not carefully tuned.

194
00:14:32,651 --> 00:14:33,891
So like, what was that like?

195
00:14:33,911 --> 00:14:37,332
Can you tell me what your guiding principle was in trying to sort of nail down

196
00:14:37,372 --> 00:14:39,152
something like a 22 minute time loop and how you,

197
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:42,133
what challenges you faced in trying to get that just right?

198
00:14:43,653 --> 00:14:45,154
Um, play tests.

199
00:14:45,694 --> 00:14:47,874
Yeah. Lots and lots of play testing.

200
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:52,855
Uh, we play tested like once every two, three weeks,

201
00:14:53,195 --> 00:14:55,556
let's say three weeks to be safe counting vacation.

202
00:14:56,136 --> 00:14:58,777
We play this once every three weeks for.

203
00:14:59,928 --> 00:15:01,248
You know, three years.

204
00:15:03,128 --> 00:15:06,729
Basically as soon as we started at Mobius, there were regular playtests testing,

205
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:09,410
you know, whatever we had just been working on, as well as like,

206
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:11,730
longer stretches of the game for new players.

207
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,471
Hmm.

208
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:14,451
Oh!

209
00:15:14,991 --> 00:15:18,032
Don't forget your spacesuit.

210
00:15:18,072 --> 00:15:19,212
Yeah. Is it not on by default?

211
00:15:19,492 --> 00:15:20,812
Is it not on by default?

212
00:15:21,332 --> 00:15:22,433
I did this yesterday, yup.

213
00:15:24,393 --> 00:15:26,613
I was like, I would never forget to put that on, and then I immediately did.

214
00:15:27,354 --> 00:15:29,054
We are learning so much today.

215
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:36,429
I guess that's a spring brotha! Let's let the organicness of the moment play into that.

216
00:15:36,509 --> 00:15:39,031
I think of a lot of games that look at that moment and go,

217
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,294
Oh no! Like, we can't let the player do that.

218
00:15:41,794 --> 00:15:43,116
Instead, you guys seem to have gone,

219
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,738
Hell yeah, the player should be able to do that every time.

220
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,902
They should be able to walk outside the space on every run.

221
00:15:48,922 --> 00:15:51,304
They should be able to die right when they get into space.

222
00:15:52,745 --> 00:15:56,407
You already mentioned that that was a decision pretty early on to reward curiosity and learning,

223
00:15:56,467 --> 00:15:59,448
and you know the player should at some point get stopped being a knucklehead and figure out

224
00:15:59,468 --> 00:16:05,050
they need to put on their space suit. But um, uh, what other decisions did you need to make to

225
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:10,431
uh, complete that vision and make sure it wasn't just like a weird hog horse I guess that that

226
00:16:10,451 --> 00:16:19,014
would that would that would only akin sometimes? I think for a lot of that fine-tuning it's just

227
00:16:19,675 --> 00:16:21,255
we as developers are

228
00:16:21,994 --> 00:16:23,155
and they were kind of obsessive about it.

229
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:27,316
Like, sort of made sure that everyone who joined the team

230
00:16:27,937 --> 00:16:31,678
was just as detail-oriented and believed in the vision of the game just as much.

231
00:16:31,698 --> 00:16:38,561
So, you know, everyone from the Creative Director all the way down to just junior artists who were hired for a brief time,

232
00:16:39,121 --> 00:16:40,502
they were still on board with like,

233
00:16:41,002 --> 00:16:45,984
yeah we're going to make sure that this piece of art or this bit of level design or this

234
00:16:46,644 --> 00:16:48,645
lighting and the way that it interacts with the area

235
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:53,963
None of that is going to trick the player into doing the wrong thing, we're never going to fake anything.

236
00:16:54,904 --> 00:17:00,307
And so it was just, really just a lot of hard work and dedication to that principle of

237
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:04,049
we need to make sure that players are playing this for the right reasons.

238
00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:09,691
Right on. I guess we can give a quick shout out to Auditory who said they finished the game a couple days ago and they love it so much.

239
00:17:11,092 --> 00:17:11,913
Awesome, thanks.

240
00:17:12,813 --> 00:17:16,055
Alex, I will throw the question all back to you now that I'm done dying in dumb ways.

241
00:17:16,615 --> 00:17:17,175
No I'm not.

242
00:17:17,195 --> 00:17:17,535
Have you?

243
00:17:18,036 --> 00:17:18,156
No.

244
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:20,591
Incorrect. Incorrect.

245
00:17:21,911 --> 00:17:25,593
Oh man, I just like this game so much. I could just talk about any one of these planets for an hour.

246
00:17:25,613 --> 00:17:30,575
I also, have you guys played The Outer Worlds at all?

247
00:17:30,615 --> 00:17:33,636
We did ask that too, for the record. If they played that game.

248
00:17:34,776 --> 00:17:39,438
I haven't had the chance. It's been pretty busy.

249
00:17:40,138 --> 00:17:42,860
Yeah. So is that, I'm just curious, like, it doesn't...

250
00:17:43,367 --> 00:17:47,949
Sometimes it can be hard to tell from the outside whether funny goofs like that, when

251
00:17:48,009 --> 00:17:52,911
two notable games share a great name or a great launch window, whether that actually

252
00:17:53,391 --> 00:17:57,573
gets on anyone's mind or whether it affects business at all.

253
00:17:57,853 --> 00:18:02,015
Did coming out so close to that game and sharing such a close title have any impact at all

254
00:18:02,075 --> 00:18:04,316
on your launch strategy or was it just kind of like a funny goof?

255
00:18:05,896 --> 00:18:08,057
I think we were definitely aware of it.

256
00:18:09,998 --> 00:18:12,199
We've had the name Agarwiles for a very long time.

257
00:18:13,484 --> 00:18:16,287
I think we saw when they registered the domain name, we're like, huh,

258
00:18:16,467 --> 00:18:18,569
hope that's just one of those that they don't actually use.

259
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:21,312
And when they announced it, we're like, okay.

260
00:18:23,093 --> 00:18:27,958
And so that was something we were aware of, but ultimately like the games are of

261
00:18:28,018 --> 00:18:32,602
such different like scales and such different target audiences that from our

262
00:18:32,642 --> 00:18:37,727
perspective, it was like probably just better for both games because the

263
00:18:37,747 --> 00:18:38,828
distinction and like the.

264
00:18:39,245 --> 00:18:43,708
controversy around the naming, you know, just got a lot of press for both of us.

265
00:18:43,828 --> 00:18:46,790
And so I think it ended up being just kind of like this funny thing that was

266
00:18:47,351 --> 00:18:51,874
good overall for exposure for both games. And we probably benefited more because we're a

267
00:18:51,914 --> 00:18:57,138
smaller studio and, you know, we're not already known, but I think it was definitely helpful for both.

268
00:18:57,978 --> 00:19:01,081
Yeah, I hope so. We got a good question here in chat from Luzu who wants to know,

269
00:19:01,201 --> 00:19:04,043
during those playtests, was there any specific things mentioned that helped you a lot?

270
00:19:04,483 --> 00:19:07,425
Or on the flip side, was there anything that came up during playtesting that you ignored?

271
00:19:08,905 --> 00:19:11,026
Also, thank you so much for one of their favorite games ever.

272
00:19:11,927 --> 00:19:15,049
So yeah, playtest, interesting feedback that shaped the course of the game or

273
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:19,273
pushback that you chose ultimately not to go against because it sort of

274
00:19:19,653 --> 00:19:20,534
conflicted with the vision?

275
00:19:23,516 --> 00:19:27,579
That's a good question. I think generally that the main thing about

276
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,101
playtests, we're not like a

277
00:19:33,703 --> 00:19:36,946
like a number, statistic, you know, we don't use playtests.

278
00:19:37,471 --> 00:19:43,933
like in a statistic way of like, how many person players reaches A and does C and whatever.

279
00:19:45,653 --> 00:19:48,354
It is more on a qualitative side of things.

280
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:56,216
And as a result, I think all feedback is useful, though it's not to be necessarily interpreted

281
00:19:56,896 --> 00:19:57,416
literally.

282
00:19:58,036 --> 00:20:05,978
Like, you know, a player might find an area too difficult or might find a mechanic confusing.

283
00:20:07,031 --> 00:20:12,652
But the way they'll express that might be, you know, might not be in such a manner.

284
00:20:12,772 --> 00:20:14,652
So it's a lot of interpretation.

285
00:20:14,712 --> 00:20:19,533
So I don't know if there's anything we ignored per se as much as like, you know,

286
00:20:19,633 --> 00:20:22,334
sometimes people complain about something and we're like,

287
00:20:23,114 --> 00:20:25,395
but actually the problem is here.

288
00:20:25,415 --> 00:20:26,195
Right.

289
00:20:26,215 --> 00:20:30,676
Making them feel, you know, but yeah, I mean, tons of things.

290
00:20:31,736 --> 00:20:35,056
One real quick example, just because you're here at the moment.

291
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:40,528
A lot of playtest changes were just simply like adding more lights to things.

292
00:20:42,109 --> 00:20:45,792
Like players weren't finding the escape pod, which is supposed to be one of the key entry

293
00:20:45,832 --> 00:20:48,213
points for each planet that has an escape pod.

294
00:20:48,674 --> 00:20:53,036
And so like, yeah, just adding that big glowing border around the door, all of a sudden players

295
00:20:53,076 --> 00:20:54,077
see it and they go through it.

296
00:20:54,417 --> 00:20:56,478
And a lot of times it's just as simple as that.

297
00:20:56,498 --> 00:21:00,401
It's like, hey, this person played for two hours and they didn't find anything that's

298
00:21:00,421 --> 00:21:01,401
supposed to be obvious.

299
00:21:01,782 --> 00:21:05,684
How can we make it more obvious without like beating people over the head?

300
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:18,064
One of the playtests things that really impacted the game a lot and that was a lot of fun for

301
00:21:18,164 --> 00:21:23,946
us was when players figured out solutions to puzzles that we hadn't thought of.

302
00:21:25,467 --> 00:21:31,068
There is, for example, a place in the game where you're supposed to time things.

303
00:21:34,189 --> 00:21:36,469
in a certain way to activate something.

304
00:21:36,589 --> 00:21:37,970
I can't spoil it too much.

305
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:47,994
But then a player tried to use their ship to sort of like protect them from what was

306
00:21:48,074 --> 00:21:48,734
affecting them.

307
00:21:49,334 --> 00:21:51,995
And we were like, oh, this is a really clever idea.

308
00:21:52,055 --> 00:21:54,456
We should implement it so that that works.

309
00:21:55,036 --> 00:21:58,597
And so a lot of times, players came up with really clever solutions.

310
00:21:59,358 --> 00:22:02,919
And we decided to make sure that these solutions

311
00:22:03,426 --> 00:22:08,848
would be like sometimes these solutions worked already but we're a bit janky so we're like okay

312
00:22:08,868 --> 00:22:16,070
how can we make it you know more consistent so they don't feel like it's weird and you know

313
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:21,632
so that was really great the fact that there's now multiple solutions to a lot of the puzzles

314
00:22:23,972 --> 00:22:28,434
because we saw players do that try things and we implemented it.

315
00:22:28,454 --> 00:22:30,374
Oh I'm so glad to hear that because I think

316
00:22:31,415 --> 00:22:34,196
You know, one of the striking parts of this game, I was telling Brian earlier this week,

317
00:22:34,256 --> 00:22:38,438
is that it sets up, because of the way it allows for emergent gameplay,

318
00:22:39,498 --> 00:22:41,739
it, you know, all the systems interact and such,

319
00:22:41,859 --> 00:22:46,401
it sets up opportunities for, like, emergent stories to emerge that mirror, like,

320
00:22:46,841 --> 00:22:49,302
you know, Gravity or Contact or Apollo 13 or something,

321
00:22:49,342 --> 00:22:53,103
where you're just trying to figure out how to get your spaceship back in the air or something.

322
00:22:53,403 --> 00:22:57,165
Like, I had a situation a night or two ago that was very similar, where I had to...

323
00:22:57,676 --> 00:23:00,438
You know, there was a thing coming that I had to avoid.

324
00:23:00,518 --> 00:23:04,240
And I basically it was like a timed event and I used the ship to survive it.

325
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:07,663
And I think that's like a really striking part of this game.

326
00:23:10,404 --> 00:23:13,046
Was that it's so crazy to me that that came out of the playtest

327
00:23:13,066 --> 00:23:17,129
because it seems so core and integral to the to the concept of the game.

328
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:19,450
But, you know, I'm impressed to hear that.

329
00:23:22,052 --> 00:23:25,694
Yeah, I just here's a I'm sorry, Brian,

330
00:23:25,714 --> 00:23:26,955
are you going to go back in that black hole again?

331
00:23:27,743 --> 00:23:28,043
Oh no.

332
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:29,043
Something's happening.

333
00:23:29,683 --> 00:23:30,023
Oh no.

334
00:23:30,983 --> 00:23:35,704
Virtual Hollow's actually a good example of a place where there's a lot of weird ways

335
00:23:35,744 --> 00:23:41,465
to solve problems because if you're really good at using orbital mechanics, you can use

336
00:23:41,505 --> 00:23:44,926
the black hole to slingshot yourself to all kinds of places that you're supposed to get

337
00:23:44,946 --> 00:23:47,426
to in less crazy ways.

338
00:23:48,707 --> 00:23:54,108
So that fun testing in the game is like, hey, I wonder if I can get there with a well-timed

339
00:23:54,148 --> 00:23:54,648
slingshot.

340
00:23:55,503 --> 00:24:01,087
We always enjoy seeing speedrunners figure out weird ways they can use the physics of the game to work it out.

341
00:24:01,127 --> 00:24:07,971
Yeah, it's really remarkable there aren't more like, and I imagine because it's so difficult, but there aren't more games about playing with gravity and slingshotting around in space.

342
00:24:07,991 --> 00:24:09,832
Gravity just, uh...

343
00:24:09,892 --> 00:24:11,873
Yeah, there you go. A classic for sure.

344
00:24:13,194 --> 00:24:21,318
So what I meant to get on there before I got distracted by Brian's fantastic journey is we were talking this week also that this game has so many opportunities.

345
00:24:21,987 --> 00:24:30,249
for storytelling and it also has a real character and atmosphere to it that is warm and convivial

346
00:24:30,309 --> 00:24:35,010
and almost melancholy and very little of that comes out of the game design or out of the

347
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:35,670
actual planets.

348
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:39,831
It comes so much out of the music and the bits of writing and the bits of art design.

349
00:24:40,631 --> 00:24:44,992
And so I'm curious to know, can you speak to the process through which you try to enrich

350
00:24:45,053 --> 00:24:50,254
this basically orrery with character and mood and atmosphere?

351
00:24:50,294 --> 00:24:51,094
How did you create?

352
00:24:51,552 --> 00:24:53,812
those feelings and emotions in a game about space?

353
00:24:56,093 --> 00:25:00,594
It's a really good question. I think there's a lot of different factors that went into it.

354
00:25:02,674 --> 00:25:08,276
I think from an art point of view, we knew pretty early on that that was sort of the tone we were

355
00:25:08,316 --> 00:25:13,497
going for. Because it was already there even back in the alpha version of the game, is that sort of

356
00:25:13,537 --> 00:25:20,059
camping in space vibe. Where it's sort of like the end of summer and you're sitting by a campfire and

357
00:25:20,664 --> 00:25:24,486
So that sort of wistful, like, this is all coming to an end, but it was a good run.

358
00:25:26,287 --> 00:25:32,731
And, you know, feeling like you're, you're in this friendly outdoor setting, that's all about exploring and,

359
00:25:33,812 --> 00:25:36,693
you know, enjoying what you have while you have it.

360
00:25:37,534 --> 00:25:40,135
And I think that was, that was there very early. And

361
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:47,139
as we were revamping the art style, we tried all kinds of things, you know, making the alien stuff more alien or

362
00:25:47,931 --> 00:25:51,253
You know, changing the scale of things to make it more epic or exciting.

363
00:25:51,974 --> 00:25:56,677
And really in the end, we kind of had to dial all that back because it ruined that

364
00:25:56,737 --> 00:25:57,898
feeling of camping in space.

365
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,961
And so in the end it was like, all right, what kinds of things do you find at a

366
00:26:02,001 --> 00:26:04,523
camp? What kinds of things do you see in a national park?

367
00:26:05,423 --> 00:26:10,707
And we referenced a lot of like the old national park ad posters like the 60s,

368
00:26:11,568 --> 00:26:13,229
which is also when NASA was really big.

369
00:26:13,289 --> 00:26:15,731
So it's like fits really well with the NASA aesthetic.

370
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:16,631
And.

371
00:26:17,246 --> 00:26:25,732
So a lot of it was just making the decision to make the art less exciting visually in

372
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:30,295
order to make it feel more comfortable and familiar, which sort of enhances the alien

373
00:26:30,335 --> 00:26:32,616
feeling in the end because of that contrast.

374
00:26:32,977 --> 00:26:35,658
But it's sort of counterintuitive and it took us a while to figure that out.

375
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,441
Oh yeah, I'm embarrassed to admit I didn't pick up on it earlier.

376
00:26:39,481 --> 00:26:43,924
There is a real, like, this is camp, down to like the makeshift uniforms and the patch

377
00:26:43,964 --> 00:26:45,945
together stuff and everyone's just kind of...

378
00:26:46,619 --> 00:26:48,981
Taking it easy. Casey Yano here in chat with a shout out.

379
00:26:49,401 --> 00:26:51,562
They're a big fan of that 3D boosty HUD thing.

380
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:53,123
That UI is great.

381
00:26:54,224 --> 00:26:57,186
Any was that tricky to design and implement to give people a sense of how

382
00:26:57,226 --> 00:27:00,268
they're flying through space? I imagine it must have been hard.

383
00:27:01,689 --> 00:27:04,731
Oh, yeah. Yeah, we tried a lot of different iterations for that.

384
00:27:05,272 --> 00:27:09,214
And I'm glad that one works because that one was one of my little additions

385
00:27:09,334 --> 00:27:12,236
to the game. It used to be like a thing that spun more.

386
00:27:13,357 --> 00:27:15,459
And I was like, what if it was just like a 3D?

387
00:27:16,937 --> 00:27:20,099
Like every axis was represented and you could see in that direction.

388
00:27:20,299 --> 00:27:22,040
And we tested it out and we're like, Oh yeah,

389
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,062
people get it now when they're flying up or down. Um, so glad you noticed.

390
00:27:26,082 --> 00:27:29,624
Nice. Uh, yeah, it's fantastic. I,

391
00:27:29,724 --> 00:27:32,465
something I've been wanting to get onto and maybe this was a good time to is

392
00:27:32,885 --> 00:27:36,427
sort of the, the business of how you get the word out about this. I mean,

393
00:27:36,807 --> 00:27:39,749
it seems like having the, uh, uh,

394
00:27:39,849 --> 00:27:43,871
the buzz around the IGF and then now the GDCA, uh, must've helped. But like,

395
00:27:43,931 --> 00:27:45,252
how did you get?

396
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:48,313
How did you get this game in front of people who you thought would like it?

397
00:27:48,413 --> 00:27:52,296
Like did you, was it a lot of marketing? Was it someone else's thing? Or did you guys do a lot of

398
00:27:52,916 --> 00:27:56,259
social media and stuff? Like how did you find the audience for this?

399
00:27:59,161 --> 00:28:04,585
We were lucky enough that we had a really committed group of fans from the alpha.

400
00:28:06,587 --> 00:28:09,949
It was a really amazing community to have

401
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:14,613
that was absurdly supportive. It was great to have them as sort of

402
00:28:15,121 --> 00:28:16,322
ambassadors for the game.

403
00:28:18,504 --> 00:28:19,024
So I think

404
00:28:19,545 --> 00:28:22,187
we had that massive advantage from the start.

405
00:28:23,508 --> 00:28:23,988
And then

406
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,070
Annapurna of course

407
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:29,292
like the fact

408
00:28:29,672 --> 00:28:31,794
coming as an Annapurna game

409
00:28:32,234 --> 00:28:35,397
you know, immediately gives a certain

410
00:28:36,398 --> 00:28:40,141
respectability in the scene and so I think

411
00:28:40,661 --> 00:28:41,742
a lot of people just...

412
00:28:43,244 --> 00:28:48,387
These two audiences sort of helped.

413
00:28:49,688 --> 00:28:52,610
It's players from players, you know, Max Thurier.

414
00:28:55,232 --> 00:28:56,593
That made it happen.

415
00:28:57,293 --> 00:28:58,114
I think it's also...

416
00:28:58,134 --> 00:29:02,016
Anand Purna made a lot of really smart decisions,

417
00:29:02,396 --> 00:29:06,199
and I think one of the best things for us was being on Game Pass at launch.

418
00:29:08,869 --> 00:29:13,832
No one's heard about the game and it's the kind of game that you really have to dive into blind to experience at best.

419
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:19,536
Game Pass was really good for getting that initial wave of people who would advocate for us.

420
00:29:20,176 --> 00:29:23,919
And, you know, those people are all spreading the word to others, which is wonderful.

421
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:28,722
But that initial, like, people giving it a shot, I think, was largely due to Game Pass.

422
00:29:29,082 --> 00:29:30,883
So, that was...

423
00:29:31,064 --> 00:29:35,266
I just had a wow moment. This is Valhalla. It's Fallen Partner in front of me.

424
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:36,627
Yep. Yep.

425
00:29:36,667 --> 00:29:37,148
It's here now.

426
00:29:38,038 --> 00:29:38,639
It's good, right?

427
00:29:39,219 --> 00:29:39,379
Yeah.

428
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:42,240
Well, every hour of this game is like that.

429
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:46,061
You're like, oh, oh, it's so good.

430
00:29:46,081 --> 00:29:51,762
I'm about to find a tree and refill my oxygen even though I have no fuel and the moon's

431
00:29:51,782 --> 00:29:53,863
going and some of the crash into the sun.

432
00:29:53,883 --> 00:29:55,604
Yeah, man, godspeed.

433
00:29:56,744 --> 00:29:59,305
Listen, so yeah, you talked about Game Pass being big.

434
00:29:59,805 --> 00:30:00,265
I'm curious.

435
00:30:02,244 --> 00:30:08,108
Do you think this game would have done as well if it hadn't had access to a subscription service like Game Pass?

436
00:30:08,148 --> 00:30:14,193
If you just put it out as a straight up pay to download title, do you think it would have done as well?

437
00:30:16,295 --> 00:30:22,479
It's hard to say. I think that it's possible it would have done as well eventually,

438
00:30:22,499 --> 00:30:25,221
but Game Pass definitely sped up the reception a lot.

439
00:30:26,582 --> 00:30:27,263
It's the game that has to...

440
00:30:30,207 --> 00:30:35,750
spread by people talking about it and Game Pass is a way to get a bunch of people talking about it really fast.

441
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:39,451
So it could have happened by streamer. It could have happened by chance.

442
00:30:40,372 --> 00:30:43,813
But Game Pass was sort of a way to ensure that it would happen more quickly.

443
00:30:44,474 --> 00:30:46,515
Nice. Yeah, I ask because like

444
00:30:47,555 --> 00:30:52,997
at the office we talk about, in the industry, we talk about like how subscription services and sort of Game Pass-esque

445
00:30:53,378 --> 00:30:56,819
offerings are going to change the way people play games and find games.

446
00:30:58,447 --> 00:31:03,108
I'm always on the edge between whether it's a wonderful thing to have access to those services,

447
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:07,229
because people can discover things without a lot of barrier to entry.

448
00:31:07,269 --> 00:31:10,489
They can just dip in and check it out and at the same time it feels like maybe it might,

449
00:31:11,049 --> 00:31:15,691
in the long term, devalue the value of a game if you can just get $200 for a monthly subscription.

450
00:31:16,431 --> 00:31:18,811
How do you guys think about it as this happens right in front of us?

451
00:31:21,152 --> 00:31:26,473
I mean, there is something to say about, in particular for a game like Attawalsa,

452
00:31:26,573 --> 00:31:27,573
it's very experimental.

453
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:31,421
And that's best played not knowing about it.

454
00:31:32,162 --> 00:31:35,664
Like, Game Pass is just perfect, you know.

455
00:31:36,044 --> 00:31:38,765
And subscription services are very useful.

456
00:31:40,466 --> 00:31:44,909
I think there's definitely an interesting...

457
00:31:46,329 --> 00:31:51,932
I think it's going to push a certain amount of innovation and experimentation.

458
00:31:52,953 --> 00:31:55,695
Because if you have access to that many games...

459
00:31:56,498 --> 00:32:02,502
Maybe you don't want each of them to be just a slight twist on a previous game.

460
00:32:03,402 --> 00:32:08,486
Like you might be more interested in shorter experiences. You might be more interested in

461
00:32:09,006 --> 00:32:13,149
things that you might not have tried before because you weren't sure you were going to enjoy

462
00:32:13,189 --> 00:32:22,655
them. So I think it's going to open very interesting avenues for games and in particular maybe also

463
00:32:22,675 --> 00:32:25,697
hopefully meaning that we have less of a

464
00:32:26,941 --> 00:32:30,283
monopoly on, you know, selling games on different platforms.

465
00:32:31,304 --> 00:32:32,584
Yeah, that'd be great.

466
00:32:32,705 --> 00:32:36,147
You keep calling this an experimental game, and I totally agree.

467
00:32:36,187 --> 00:32:38,728
Like, so much of what you've tried here in the systems and the way they interact

468
00:32:38,808 --> 00:32:42,931
is very experimental, and it's like a wonder in some ways that it all works so well as it does.

469
00:32:42,951 --> 00:32:48,114
But at the same time, it just feels strange to hear you talk about this game that way,

470
00:32:48,154 --> 00:32:52,056
because it's a game about exploring space, and that seems like a fundamental...

471
00:32:52,995 --> 00:32:56,018
category of what interactive entertainment could be.

472
00:32:56,238 --> 00:32:59,801
And yet when I think about space exploration games or games that remind me of this game,

473
00:33:00,201 --> 00:33:03,784
the one that comes to my mind is like Lunar Lander, which was decades ago.

474
00:33:04,005 --> 00:33:07,708
So I mean, it's hard to argue with you. There aren't a lot of games like this.

475
00:33:07,728 --> 00:33:13,052
There aren't a lot of games that try this blend of exploration and that kind of thing.

476
00:33:13,072 --> 00:33:16,075
So like, why do you think that is? And beyond that, like,

477
00:33:16,095 --> 00:33:18,797
do you think you'll continue to try and make games like this going forward?

478
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:20,398
I think.

479
00:33:20,893 --> 00:33:26,636
A quick aside, it's also worth noting that when the project started in 2013, that was

480
00:33:26,696 --> 00:33:31,479
before things like Elite Dangerous and No Man's Sky and all of these new space games.

481
00:33:31,539 --> 00:33:35,942
It's kind of been a resurgence that we're now a part of, but when the project was conceived

482
00:33:35,982 --> 00:33:38,343
there had been no space games for a long time.

483
00:33:38,984 --> 00:33:39,204
Yeah.

484
00:33:40,104 --> 00:33:40,505
Yeah.

485
00:33:41,485 --> 00:33:41,945
Yeah.

486
00:33:42,306 --> 00:33:42,566
Yeah.

487
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:43,466
Yeah.

488
00:33:44,967 --> 00:33:49,350
And also, at the time, games were a lot more hand-holdy.

489
00:33:51,389 --> 00:33:58,074
The project started when Zelda Skyward Sword just came out.

490
00:33:59,335 --> 00:34:11,184
And so I think that shows where the industry was at and where the most games gravitated towards a very hand-holdy, linear approach to things.

491
00:34:12,646 --> 00:34:18,730
And it's really exciting, the latest Zelda being proof that I think the...

492
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:27,746
While we worked on Outer Wilds, a lot of other people also gravitated towards more open exploration

493
00:34:27,946 --> 00:34:30,167
and more trusting the player.

494
00:34:30,367 --> 00:34:37,632
And I think that's a big thing that games such as Dark Souls have brought to the scene.

495
00:34:37,712 --> 00:34:44,397
It's this idea that as designers we can trust the players not to be, you know, we don't

496
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:47,479
have to tell them what to do at every step of the way.

497
00:34:48,657 --> 00:34:54,263
We can just present them with fun environments and great mechanics, and they'll experiment

498
00:34:54,323 --> 00:35:00,550
and try and they can figure it out on their own with this great UI and a lot of playtests

499
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:02,012
to make sure it is understandable.

500
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:10,272
Um, man, uh, I was talking to, um, Hugo Mar- Hugo Martin of id Software, kind of about the same thing.

501
00:35:10,532 --> 00:35:15,314
Um, uh, he was talking about how, about, you know, again, fighting that instinct to just make

502
00:35:15,374 --> 00:35:19,275
everything easy. And he, he outright said, you know, there was a trend where games couldn't be

503
00:35:19,316 --> 00:35:25,138
hard, which is, was his words. Um, uh, man, this place is weird. This place is weird. I'm

504
00:35:25,178 --> 00:35:28,099
uncomfortable. I'm going away. You should go in there. Please go in there. No. Please,

505
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:29,460
please go on Dark Bramble, please.

506
00:35:30,382 --> 00:35:30,722
Fine.

507
00:35:30,942 --> 00:35:31,203
Fine.

508
00:35:31,343 --> 00:35:32,623
It's for the stream.

509
00:35:32,643 --> 00:35:33,264
This is fine.

510
00:35:34,544 --> 00:35:34,884
All right.

511
00:35:34,904 --> 00:35:37,746
Let me push it.

512
00:35:38,226 --> 00:35:38,686
Um, anyway.

513
00:35:38,726 --> 00:35:38,946
Yeah.

514
00:35:39,267 --> 00:35:41,528
Uh, yeah, this is interesting just cause I've heard triple

515
00:35:41,588 --> 00:35:42,928
E devs talking about the same thing.

516
00:35:44,009 --> 00:35:44,649
A different way.

517
00:35:44,829 --> 00:35:47,450
And it's interesting that like the dark souls lesson was kind of that.

518
00:35:47,471 --> 00:35:47,991
All right.

519
00:35:50,192 --> 00:35:50,472
I'm in.

520
00:35:50,632 --> 00:35:50,892
Yeah.

521
00:35:51,392 --> 00:35:51,953
Uh huh.

522
00:35:53,493 --> 00:35:54,574
The dark souls lesson was.

523
00:35:56,987 --> 00:35:59,668
Good.

524
00:35:59,828 --> 00:36:01,429
Good luck in there.

525
00:36:02,149 --> 00:36:07,411
Yeah, I think it is certainly interesting to see this, to see what feels like a renewed

526
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:12,834
and reinvigorated wave of teams, you know, studios and developers trusting players and

527
00:36:12,874 --> 00:36:16,416
not sort of handholding them through the game.

528
00:36:17,116 --> 00:36:20,377
I wonder, I wonder if we'll ever go back around the other way, you know, like, will there

529
00:36:20,397 --> 00:36:25,420
be a backlash where suddenly there's a huge emphasis on intuitive tutorial design or streamlined

530
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,600
tutorial design or what have you.

531
00:36:27,962 --> 00:36:30,144
Wow, Brian, you nailed it. Good work.

532
00:36:34,446 --> 00:36:36,968
But for now, what I kind of wanted to get at was,

533
00:36:37,849 --> 00:36:43,833
do you feel rewarded by pursuing this philosophy of game design?

534
00:36:43,873 --> 00:36:46,515
And are you excited to continue doing it?

535
00:36:47,035 --> 00:36:50,518
Are you still interested in making games that are about exploration

536
00:36:50,598 --> 00:36:52,779
and not holding the player's hand about discovery?

537
00:36:52,799 --> 00:36:56,402
Or are you excited to work on something that is maybe a little less experimental?

538
00:36:58,712 --> 00:37:00,693
I think it's a little bit of both.

539
00:37:01,874 --> 00:37:02,474
We're all kind of...

540
00:37:03,935 --> 00:37:05,656
Outer Wilds was a very difficult game to make.

541
00:37:06,457 --> 00:37:09,518
We often joke that it's exactly the type of game you should not make.

542
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:13,020
Like, our advice to people is don't make Outer Wilds.

543
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,901
It's really just not a good idea.

544
00:37:14,921 --> 00:37:15,722
Okay.

545
00:37:17,043 --> 00:37:17,503
It's just...

546
00:37:19,044 --> 00:37:23,146
There's a lot of tools in game development that are built around assumptions.

547
00:37:24,187 --> 00:37:26,468
Like the assumption that you're going to make things flat.

548
00:37:26,968 --> 00:37:28,229
Because that's what you do.

549
00:37:29,044 --> 00:37:32,785
You're going to have a flat plane, and you're going to build everything on that flat plane.

550
00:37:33,225 --> 00:37:36,747
And when you're building these spherical planetoids, there just aren't tools to do that.

551
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:38,228
And so you've got to do it yourself.

552
00:37:39,068 --> 00:37:40,749
And it's a lot of little things like that.

553
00:37:40,829 --> 00:37:44,050
Like, game engines are built around static objects that don't move.

554
00:37:44,551 --> 00:37:49,753
And anything that interacts with physics is marked as not static.

555
00:37:49,993 --> 00:37:52,714
Because it's different and needs to behave differently.

556
00:37:53,195 --> 00:37:54,775
Everything in Outer Wilds is not static.

557
00:37:55,517 --> 00:37:59,600
So we couldn't rely on a lot of things that static objects can do and

558
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:02,682
optimizations that apply to static objects because nothing is static.

559
00:38:04,183 --> 00:38:04,524
Lighting?

560
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:05,665
Lighting.

561
00:38:05,885 --> 00:38:06,105
Yeah.

562
00:38:06,225 --> 00:38:11,009
We, you know, lighting is all based on like either lights are everywhere or

563
00:38:11,049 --> 00:38:16,073
lights are localized, but we wanted lights to be spherical and that's, you

564
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:17,594
know, not really how they're built.

565
00:38:18,134 --> 00:38:21,577
Um, and so a lot of the game was just like, okay.

566
00:38:22,389 --> 00:38:27,832
We need to do this thing that every game does because that's what you do in games, but we

567
00:38:27,892 --> 00:38:34,196
can't do it because the game engine or the 3D modeling software just doesn't support

568
00:38:34,736 --> 00:38:38,118
spheres or movement on a fundamental level.

569
00:38:39,619 --> 00:38:45,102
So that's, at least from an asset creation, from an art side of view, that was the biggest

570
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:50,325
hurdle that we had to overcome, is that the tools are not there and we had to make a lot

571
00:38:50,345 --> 00:38:51,285
of our own tools to do it.

572
00:38:53,778 --> 00:38:56,759
This is a silly question, I guess, but did you make those tools available to anybody else?

573
00:38:56,779 --> 00:38:57,500
They sound useful.

574
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:58,920
Or is it all internal?

575
00:38:59,561 --> 00:39:00,261
It's all internal.

576
00:39:01,482 --> 00:39:07,605
We've talked about maybe trying to package them to make them accessible to more people.

577
00:39:08,666 --> 00:39:14,229
But you know, like any internal tools, there's a lot of shortcuts that you use.

578
00:39:15,009 --> 00:39:17,210
And we're like, that would be a lot of work.

579
00:39:18,031 --> 00:39:18,871
We haven't done there.

580
00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:26,161
If a lot of people ask, honestly, that is something we would happily try to take the

581
00:39:26,201 --> 00:39:26,701
time to do.

582
00:39:27,482 --> 00:39:29,363
I would love to see more spheres in video games.

583
00:39:29,423 --> 00:39:30,043
Spheres are the best.

584
00:39:31,644 --> 00:39:32,345
Brian, get in there.

585
00:39:33,645 --> 00:39:34,206
Don't be chicken.

586
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:34,666
Get in there.

587
00:39:34,686 --> 00:39:36,487
I'm trying to get to the thing.

588
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:37,388
I'm orbiting it.

589
00:39:37,988 --> 00:39:39,929
Well, just fly inside the planet.

590
00:39:39,969 --> 00:39:40,290
It's good.

591
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:41,110
It's a good look.

592
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:41,530
I'm backseat flying.

593
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:41,891
Come on, let's go.

594
00:39:41,911 --> 00:39:42,431
I call content here.

595
00:39:42,451 --> 00:39:42,851
I'm backseat flying.

596
00:39:42,871 --> 00:39:43,392
Come on, let's go.

597
00:39:43,412 --> 00:39:44,012
I call content here.

598
00:39:44,392 --> 00:39:45,073
I'm backseat flying.

599
00:39:45,093 --> 00:39:46,734
Come on, let's go.

600
00:39:46,774 --> 00:39:47,975
I'm backseat flying.

601
00:39:48,015 --> 00:39:48,475
I'm backseat flying.

602
00:39:48,495 --> 00:39:49,075
I'm backseat flying.

603
00:39:52,258 --> 00:39:57,463
Well, then I hope you find something that is a little less strenuous to work on for your

604
00:39:57,483 --> 00:39:58,044
next project.

605
00:39:58,404 --> 00:40:02,428
I just love this little navigator thing down in the lower left hand corner for this ship.

606
00:40:03,248 --> 00:40:05,811
Oh, you know what's great?

607
00:40:05,871 --> 00:40:09,794
That whole UI is great, we should talk about that, but also, unbuckle and look down to

608
00:40:09,814 --> 00:40:11,796
your bottom right to find the eject button.

609
00:40:13,497 --> 00:40:15,339
Because you're going to want that eject button at some point.

610
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:16,620
Is there an eject button?

611
00:40:17,428 --> 00:40:20,189
It's on the console. It's on the console. There's like a little thing you flip up.

612
00:40:20,429 --> 00:40:23,130
No, it's to the left. This is good. This is good content.

613
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:25,250
Anyway, there's an eject button on the console.

614
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:28,071
Tell me about that eject button. Who put that in there and why?

615
00:40:29,611 --> 00:40:30,972
I'll take partial credit for that.

616
00:40:31,392 --> 00:40:34,113
Please. I spent a lot of time working on the ship,

617
00:40:35,193 --> 00:40:38,774
and one of the big goals for the ship was to make it

618
00:40:40,415 --> 00:40:43,195
feel like it's sort of twofold.

619
00:40:43,255 --> 00:40:44,376
It's both the player's home.

620
00:40:44,536 --> 00:40:46,516
You want the player to feel like it's a safe space

621
00:40:46,556 --> 00:40:47,037
and that they can.

622
00:40:47,787 --> 00:40:50,848
you know, like have a lot of useful things there.

623
00:40:50,888 --> 00:40:53,769
So it's not just jump out of it and be on your way. Um,

624
00:40:53,789 --> 00:40:56,709
but we also wanted the ship to interact with all the systems in the game.

625
00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:00,590
And so at some point we were like, Hey,

626
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:04,371
we should make it so the ship can like break apart. So if you slam, you know,

627
00:41:04,411 --> 00:41:07,632
one of the sides of the ship, it can actually get pulled off and you know,

628
00:41:07,652 --> 00:41:11,593
your ship can damage and you end up with those cool Apollo 13 moments where it's

629
00:41:11,633 --> 00:41:14,113
like you're spiraling out of control. And so.

630
00:41:14,888 --> 00:41:20,051
We took a lot of effort to like go back and make the ship modular so that we could break it apart and you know,

631
00:41:20,071 --> 00:41:24,072
have it actually systems can break individually and all of that. Uh,

632
00:41:24,133 --> 00:41:26,133
and while we were doing that, we were like, Hey,

633
00:41:26,173 --> 00:41:29,475
we've just made it so the cockpit can just like pop off the front of the ship.

634
00:41:29,975 --> 00:41:32,476
Why don't we just put a button in that does that just for fun?

635
00:41:35,057 --> 00:41:37,919
Pressing it too much. So we kind of had to hide it a little bit. So it wasn't.

636
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:39,159
Yes, but.

637
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:43,641
Sorry. I'm not obsessed with this object.

638
00:41:43,661 --> 00:41:44,561
See what else. See.

639
00:41:45,533 --> 00:41:46,574
This whole planet is so good.

640
00:41:48,715 --> 00:41:52,978
Yeah, and also like, I love the eject button. I'm so glad you put it in.

641
00:41:53,618 --> 00:41:59,562
These little light up indicators on the HUD, these like very analog thrust indicators,

642
00:42:00,082 --> 00:42:02,724
were those also yours or were those a result of playtesting?

643
00:42:02,764 --> 00:42:05,386
Because I can't remember if those were in the original build or not.

644
00:42:06,326 --> 00:42:09,889
No, the original, the Alpha ship was pretty barebones.

645
00:42:10,169 --> 00:42:10,489
Yeah.

646
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:14,551
I think a lot of us on the team are a big fan of...

647
00:42:15,404 --> 00:42:20,606
um, diegetic UI stuff that's like built into the game itself and not just on screen.

648
00:42:21,286 --> 00:42:25,588
Um, so that's why like a lot of the HUD elements only appear when you put on your helmet,

649
00:42:25,688 --> 00:42:29,129
just because it's actually like a thing in-world that's being projected.

650
00:42:29,869 --> 00:42:33,591
Um, we make an exception for button prompts just because people need to learn how to play the game

651
00:42:33,631 --> 00:42:36,112
and it doesn't make sense for that to be in-world.

652
00:42:36,192 --> 00:42:41,654
But yeah, we, we, we took the, we went the extra mile to make all of the ship

653
00:42:41,714 --> 00:42:44,395
and all the player tools communicate information physically.

654
00:42:44,994 --> 00:42:49,096
instead of just something popping up on the screen because it makes you feel like an astronaut.

655
00:42:49,376 --> 00:42:52,238
You feel like interacting with these instruments and you feel like

656
00:42:52,838 --> 00:42:57,501
you're a part of the world and you know that's the same reason why we put your body in the game

657
00:42:57,561 --> 00:43:01,884
so when you look down you see your feet is to make you feel like you're there which heightens

658
00:43:01,944 --> 00:43:07,307
the sense of space. Did you learn anything fun about physics or space exploration while

659
00:43:07,327 --> 00:43:10,009
you're making this video game? Oh god.

660
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:15,761
Seems like a fun project to work on if you're really into NASA.

661
00:43:16,682 --> 00:43:18,183
Oh yeah.

662
00:43:18,343 --> 00:43:22,045
Our technical artist Logan programmed all the shaders.

663
00:43:22,845 --> 00:43:27,488
And so things like the atmospheres around planets, that's a shader that Logan wrote.

664
00:43:28,109 --> 00:43:32,891
And a lot of research went into like how do atmospheres work, actually.

665
00:43:33,272 --> 00:43:38,155
Because in order to get it to look right, it has to pretty much just receive light in the same way.

666
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:42,592
A lot of times during the project we would take a dive into something like that.

667
00:43:42,672 --> 00:43:47,315
It's just like, alright, for the black hole in Brittle Hollow, that's just actual black

668
00:43:47,355 --> 00:43:47,855
hole math.

669
00:43:48,436 --> 00:43:49,437
Yeah.

670
00:43:49,477 --> 00:43:50,557
That's so exciting to me.

671
00:43:50,898 --> 00:43:55,561
Maybe it's childish, but there just aren't a lot of opportunities to put your face inside

672
00:43:55,601 --> 00:43:57,242
a universe and see what a black hole does.

673
00:43:58,123 --> 00:43:58,983
And this is one of them.

674
00:43:59,784 --> 00:44:02,846
And I'm so glad to hear you guys put some work and research into actually making that

675
00:44:02,866 --> 00:44:04,767
look what it might actually look like.

676
00:44:10,164 --> 00:44:10,244
Ugh.

677
00:44:10,984 --> 00:44:11,144
Um.

678
00:44:11,704 --> 00:44:12,725
Boy, what was I about to ask?

679
00:44:13,465 --> 00:44:13,565
Uh.

680
00:44:14,846 --> 00:44:16,787
Brian, you distracted me with this beautiful planet.

681
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:17,608
Uh.

682
00:44:18,208 --> 00:44:18,528
Shucks.

683
00:44:19,509 --> 00:44:20,929
Well, anyway, we're coming to the end of our hour.

684
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:21,970
We got about 15 minutes left.

685
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:25,652
Folks in chat, if you have any questions, uh, about this game or about its

686
00:44:25,672 --> 00:44:28,574
development or about what their devs are going to be up to now, please put them in

687
00:44:28,614 --> 00:44:30,395
chat and we will be very happy to relay them.

688
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:32,456
Uh, Brian, you're doing great.

689
00:44:34,097 --> 00:44:35,837
Do you have any pressing questions?

690
00:44:37,058 --> 00:44:37,218
No.

691
00:44:38,251 --> 00:44:43,515
This is one of those games where all my questions get thrown out by the concentration it takes to play it.

692
00:44:43,535 --> 00:44:44,576
Where did that island even go?

693
00:44:44,596 --> 00:44:46,417
I'm really not sure.

694
00:44:46,437 --> 00:44:49,540
It's just something. We're on giant's teeth.

695
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:50,281
Yeah?

696
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:51,442
Yeah.

697
00:44:52,542 --> 00:44:54,944
We're running this tornado. This is what's happening.

698
00:44:56,105 --> 00:44:57,246
You're killing it. You're doing great.

699
00:44:58,307 --> 00:44:59,008
What could go wrong?

700
00:45:00,645 --> 00:45:05,988
How are you guys feeling about all these, uh, all the awards and coverage and stuff? Do you feel like that was, uh, worth the time?

701
00:45:06,008 --> 00:45:07,809
We should probably mention the awards they're nominated for, man.

702
00:45:08,009 --> 00:45:09,330
Right. Well, see, I was-

703
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:10,910
I left them in the back. Can you grab that?

704
00:45:11,811 --> 00:45:17,414
Uh, yeah, I would be happy to. So, after, uh, winning the IGF a few years ago,

705
00:45:17,434 --> 00:45:22,597
uh, now I believe you're up for Game of the Year at, uh, Game Developers Choice Awards.

706
00:45:22,737 --> 00:45:26,959
The Best Debut, Best Divine, uh, Best Design, Innovation, and the Narrative Award. That's-

707
00:45:27,538 --> 00:45:30,399
That's a good slew of honors.

708
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:34,641
How are you feeling about all this awards coverage and what it has done for the game?

709
00:45:34,841 --> 00:45:36,522
Has it been just an alloyed good?

710
00:45:36,782 --> 00:45:40,904
Has it been worth the effort of investing in that kind of coverage?

711
00:45:40,964 --> 00:45:43,225
Or has it been in any way interesting?

712
00:45:45,026 --> 00:45:53,470
I mean, it's always really awesome to be considered for that sort of awards.

713
00:45:54,490 --> 00:45:56,131
It's been the reception.

714
00:45:57,562 --> 00:46:00,083
both critically and player-wise has been wonderful.

715
00:46:01,444 --> 00:46:05,187
Personally, I mean, it's a huge honor to receive awards.

716
00:46:05,668 --> 00:46:09,671
I think some of the fan letters we've been receiving have been

717
00:46:10,211 --> 00:46:12,993
just heartbreakingly wonderful.

718
00:46:15,435 --> 00:46:19,358
And that would be personally my greatest reward,

719
00:46:19,458 --> 00:46:24,882
is hearing about parents playing with their kids and

720
00:46:24,902 --> 00:46:26,083
their kids wanting to

721
00:46:26,613 --> 00:46:28,835
learn about science or become an astronaut.

722
00:46:29,275 --> 00:46:32,577
And that sort of thing has been incredible.

723
00:46:33,198 --> 00:46:37,301
Yeah, that's fantastic. I'm so glad to hear it.

724
00:46:38,061 --> 00:46:42,084
Do you have any strong concerns at this point about supporting

725
00:46:42,104 --> 00:46:44,706
this game? I mean you're talking about porting it, it sounds like it's still a

726
00:46:44,726 --> 00:46:47,568
lot of work as you continue to work on it, but like

727
00:46:47,868 --> 00:46:50,610
in terms of support, is it just patching and bug fixing now or do you have

728
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:53,613
anything else you want to do with Outer Wilds as a...

729
00:46:56,786 --> 00:47:01,547
We've actually made some significant changes post-launch.

730
00:47:01,627 --> 00:47:03,147
Maybe more changes than we should have.

731
00:47:03,767 --> 00:47:05,168
Oh, how come? Tell me about it.

732
00:47:06,148 --> 00:47:10,429
We've tweaked the level design in several areas to try and help players

733
00:47:11,109 --> 00:47:15,250
figure out some of the in-game solutions to things because

734
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:17,370
we just didn't have enough playtest data.

735
00:47:17,550 --> 00:47:20,591
And once everyone's playing it, you get more data.

736
00:47:20,891 --> 00:47:22,972
Added some fun little features like...

737
00:47:23,394 --> 00:47:26,515
The ability to doze off at campfires to pass time a little bit more quickly,

738
00:47:26,955 --> 00:47:30,675
which is that we always wanted to do, but we didn't have time to release.

739
00:47:31,716 --> 00:47:34,136
So just we're still fiddling with it a bit.

740
00:47:35,336 --> 00:47:38,277
It's definitely it's hard to put down.

741
00:47:39,037 --> 00:47:44,258
Nice. I know this is not necessarily the first game for all of you.

742
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:46,858
I'm sure you have a variety of experience on your belt.

743
00:47:46,899 --> 00:47:49,619
But this being having its origins as a student project

744
00:47:50,119 --> 00:47:52,980
and now hitting this so much far later, it feels like there must be

745
00:47:54,279 --> 00:48:01,002
Some like well-deserved like honor and like pride, but also like is there any, is it,

746
00:48:01,723 --> 00:48:04,704
are you stressed at all about making your next game after this?

747
00:48:04,764 --> 00:48:06,065
It seems to have done very well.

748
00:48:06,445 --> 00:48:08,466
It's certainly being well-received by folks like us.

749
00:48:09,707 --> 00:48:12,748
And now you guys are going to have to move on to something else.

750
00:48:12,809 --> 00:48:16,410
Is there any like weight about a sophomore slump or any concern about what you're going

751
00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:20,953
to do next or is it just all good vibes and optimism?

752
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:26,481
It's definitely a bit scary moving forward, yeah?

753
00:48:27,021 --> 00:48:27,261
Yeah.

754
00:48:28,281 --> 00:48:29,442
It's a hard thing to follow up.

755
00:48:30,202 --> 00:48:31,762
So, I think we're all...

756
00:48:32,122 --> 00:48:33,262
It's a little bit of both, right?

757
00:48:33,402 --> 00:48:40,504
Because the positive response to the game means that we found an audience that wants

758
00:48:40,904 --> 00:48:44,425
this type of thing, which is the type of thing that we want to make, generally speaking.

759
00:48:45,545 --> 00:48:49,506
So that's super exciting to see, that there is an audience for a weird game like Outer

760
00:48:49,526 --> 00:48:49,926
Gardens.

761
00:48:50,506 --> 00:48:51,366
But it's also like...

762
00:48:52,548 --> 00:48:57,713
Outer Wilds was a seven-year project, and a lot of blood, sweat, and tears went into making it.

763
00:48:57,833 --> 00:49:04,519
And it's very daunting to think of going through that process again and taking a big risk.

764
00:49:06,722 --> 00:49:10,125
Yeah, I can only imagine.

765
00:49:12,087 --> 00:49:15,750
Uh, well, we are, uh, oh, actually.

766
00:49:16,362 --> 00:49:20,887
Brian, you were looking at that writing a minute ago. We should talk about this writing. It's great.

767
00:49:21,908 --> 00:49:25,932
It's the whole conception of an alien thing in this because everything in here is really smart.

768
00:49:26,293 --> 00:49:28,375
I think it's a smart way to think about alien life.

769
00:49:29,316 --> 00:49:31,358
Right, so let's start with the writing and go from there.

770
00:49:32,704 --> 00:49:37,728
Can you guys speak to what influenced the design process for this kind of like totally,

771
00:49:38,249 --> 00:49:43,754
to me at least, being very uneducated and American, like relatively novel way of writing

772
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:46,136
and flowing sort of curly Q scripts?

773
00:49:47,217 --> 00:49:48,498
Where did that come from, if you know?

774
00:49:50,119 --> 00:49:58,006
So we worked very closely with our writer, Kelsey Higginbotham, with all the writing

775
00:49:58,026 --> 00:49:58,426
in the game.

776
00:50:02,144 --> 00:50:11,448
One of the prompts we had was the idea of making text something you would explore,

777
00:50:12,028 --> 00:50:13,989
the same way you explore everything else in the game.

778
00:50:15,029 --> 00:50:19,071
So we wanted to make it spatial, we wanted to make it explorable.

779
00:50:19,931 --> 00:50:24,273
And Kelsey had the idea of using her own way of taking notes.

780
00:50:31,915 --> 00:50:34,698
this branching kind of like forum style.

781
00:50:35,659 --> 00:50:36,739
Oh, interesting.

782
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:45,126
Instead of like this linear writing, it's more of a like, you know, it's a branching forum of conversations.

783
00:50:46,748 --> 00:50:53,874
That was, yeah, I think she was mentioning it was kind of influenced by our own way of taking notes.

784
00:50:54,634 --> 00:50:58,338
And so we took that and then we played with the visuals.

785
00:51:00,348 --> 00:51:10,790
And I think we looked at a lot of different influences and we ended up picking Spirals as the best way to do that.

786
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:25,013
But yeah, Chelsea has done an amazing job creating the writing and building so much characters into these stories, right?

787
00:51:25,033 --> 00:51:27,773
Because none of the writing is just backstory.

788
00:51:27,993 --> 00:51:29,653
All of the writing is usable.

789
00:51:30,302 --> 00:51:33,464
useful information that you can actively use in-game.

790
00:51:33,484 --> 00:51:36,186
It's really important for us to do that.

791
00:51:36,286 --> 00:51:38,908
And we learned that as we developed the game.

792
00:51:38,968 --> 00:51:41,030
But like, there's such a...

793
00:51:42,771 --> 00:51:48,115
Players are so used to see writing as lore, as you know, bonus thing that you just read

794
00:51:48,195 --> 00:51:49,756
if you want to, when you have the time.

795
00:51:51,237 --> 00:51:57,242
And so like, we had to sort of teach that to players and, you know, make sure they understood

796
00:51:57,282 --> 00:51:59,503
that like, no, everything you read...

797
00:51:59,966 --> 00:52:03,388
has actual, like, you can use it.

798
00:52:03,528 --> 00:52:05,589
It actually talks about something in the world

799
00:52:06,270 --> 00:52:08,471
and you can use that.

800
00:52:10,012 --> 00:52:12,053
But as a result, you know,

801
00:52:12,073 --> 00:52:14,334
we could have made the writing very dry.

802
00:52:14,875 --> 00:52:16,556
And so we were really happy

803
00:52:16,576 --> 00:52:19,798
because it was able to put in so much like character

804
00:52:19,878 --> 00:52:25,421
and humor and drama and romance into that writing.

805
00:52:25,676 --> 00:52:29,717
That is about, you know, telling you dry facts about the world.

806
00:52:30,717 --> 00:52:32,037
Yeah, no, absolutely.

807
00:52:32,097 --> 00:52:36,138
I think Brian can attest I can I can sometimes be a harsh critic of writing

808
00:52:36,178 --> 00:52:38,719
and video games, and I think like the writing in this game is

809
00:52:39,299 --> 00:52:41,840
is really affecting for how sparse it is.

810
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:44,680
You know, it is so much just like info on the walls,

811
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:48,061
environmental storytelling, yet nevertheless, whoever, you know,

812
00:52:48,081 --> 00:52:52,002
the writer was able to like really bring a sense of character and like pathos

813
00:52:52,022 --> 00:52:52,302
to these.

814
00:52:53,272 --> 00:52:55,434
uh... wall scribbles so like i think that's great

815
00:52:55,454 --> 00:52:59,459
you guys make the uh... and i don't understand why no other game developer has

816
00:52:59,479 --> 00:53:01,581
has uh... not

817
00:53:02,675 --> 00:53:07,417
A for this goal is you guys take the ancient civilization trope and manage to

818
00:53:08,817 --> 00:53:13,519
Flip it on its head and instead of all the writing either feeling like it's coming from

819
00:53:13,939 --> 00:53:18,640
Scientists or I don't know at best scientists if it feels like if ancient writing feels like it's come from inside a world

820
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:21,761
It'll be scientists or something or people who would be leading logs

821
00:53:22,861 --> 00:53:25,322
Or it's it's it presents as unsellable

822
00:53:25,862 --> 00:53:26,983
intelligible gibberish

823
00:53:27,603 --> 00:53:31,004
reinterpreted by the character that you're piloting

824
00:53:32,355 --> 00:53:33,996
It's uh... here, it's people.

825
00:53:34,217 --> 00:53:35,217
Just feels like people.

826
00:53:35,237 --> 00:53:37,238
It feels like notes that could've been left five minutes ago.

827
00:53:37,819 --> 00:53:39,980
Um, and the translation mechanic doesn't get in the way of that.

828
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:40,500
And...

829
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:41,721
I like that a lot!

830
00:53:41,861 --> 00:53:44,083
It makes me want to learn more about these people instead of...

831
00:53:44,643 --> 00:53:49,426
I hate to say it, uh, two of my favorite game series, AAA game series, both that both relied on ancient alien metaphors.

832
00:53:50,066 --> 00:53:54,709
Got more and less and less interesting the more I learned about them because everything felt very sterile and...

833
00:53:55,009 --> 00:53:56,670
And less... less... less suitable.

834
00:53:57,471 --> 00:53:59,152
Um, I will start wrapping things up today.

835
00:53:59,172 --> 00:54:00,753
Uh, I'm... I'm a little tired.

836
00:54:01,073 --> 00:54:01,433
My ship...

837
00:54:02,353 --> 00:54:02,853
is gone.

838
00:54:04,514 --> 00:54:04,854
Error.

839
00:54:04,874 --> 00:54:06,734
You're doing great.

840
00:54:32,266 --> 00:54:33,307
I don't think it's March 8th.

841
00:54:33,347 --> 00:54:34,227
You want to suppose that?

842
00:54:34,307 --> 00:54:34,768
March 18th.

843
00:54:34,948 --> 00:54:35,088
18th.

844
00:54:35,128 --> 00:54:35,828
Yeah.

845
00:54:35,868 --> 00:54:36,249
Yeah.

846
00:54:36,529 --> 00:54:37,009
It's March 18th.

847
00:54:37,049 --> 00:54:37,449
I'm tired.

848
00:54:38,130 --> 00:54:38,270
Um.

849
00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:38,590
We're...

850
00:54:39,671 --> 00:54:40,171
We're worse.

851
00:54:40,992 --> 00:54:41,812
This country is tired.

852
00:54:41,832 --> 00:54:42,273
Um.

853
00:54:43,013 --> 00:54:43,293
Yeah.

854
00:54:43,394 --> 00:54:47,336
So if you want to attend in person, if you have a GDC pass, everyone can attend.

855
00:54:47,436 --> 00:54:51,539
If you want to watch online, in the comfort of your home, uh, you can do that too.

856
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:53,040
Just stay tuned to this Twitch channel.

857
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:53,480
Um.

858
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:53,700
And...

859
00:54:54,101 --> 00:54:55,282
Oh, that's why you hit the follow button.

860
00:54:55,942 --> 00:54:56,042
Um.

861
00:54:56,657 --> 00:54:59,418
Other than that, that's all I've got for today.

862
00:54:59,558 --> 00:55:06,340
Thank you to Bone and Wesley for joining us, and if they have more questions about the making of this game, where should they ask them?

863
00:55:10,301 --> 00:55:12,582
Support, support at Mobius Digital Games.

864
00:55:13,102 --> 00:55:16,723
I'm still waiting for a developer to just go, don't.

865
00:55:18,744 --> 00:55:21,225
We have a small team, so we do see your emails.

866
00:55:21,585 --> 00:55:22,165
Yeah.

867
00:55:22,265 --> 00:55:25,566
And we also, we don't participate a lot in it, but we...

868
00:55:26,303 --> 00:55:28,064
Check the subreddit as well.

869
00:55:28,104 --> 00:55:29,585
The Adderall subreddit.
