1
00:00:05,935 --> 00:00:06,175
All right.

2
00:00:06,195 --> 00:00:07,615
Hey, everybody.

3
00:00:07,655 --> 00:00:08,596
My name's Brian Horton.

4
00:00:08,896 --> 00:00:11,256
I am the studio art director at Infinity Ward.

5
00:00:11,357 --> 00:00:15,018
And it's great to be here today to talk about our topic, which

6
00:00:15,118 --> 00:00:16,478
is creating a believable hero.

7
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:19,559
I've been in the industry for about 22 years.

8
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,961
I've been working mostly in the art field.

9
00:00:24,021 --> 00:00:26,822
But on Tomb Raider, I was able to work more

10
00:00:26,842 --> 00:00:28,342
on the creative side, on game direction.

11
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:35,744
My career sort of takes me from Disney to DreamWorks to working with EA and Konami,

12
00:00:36,505 --> 00:00:40,286
and most recently I worked on Infinite Warfare and Infinity War.

13
00:00:41,586 --> 00:00:43,907
But today, let's talk a little bit about the topic.

14
00:00:45,187 --> 00:00:47,127
And I'm going to go through a couple chapters,

15
00:00:47,488 --> 00:00:51,329
each one sort of designating a different area of focus

16
00:00:51,489 --> 00:00:53,269
around creating your believable character.

17
00:00:53,989 --> 00:00:57,070
The first chapter is about tapping into the universal.

18
00:00:58,286 --> 00:01:00,066
Storytelling has been going on for millennia,

19
00:01:00,867 --> 00:01:03,948
and there are themes and there are connections

20
00:01:04,008 --> 00:01:06,968
that we've made and certain people have made

21
00:01:07,249 --> 00:01:09,469
that connects storytelling across all genres

22
00:01:09,489 --> 00:01:10,169
and all cultures.

23
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:12,910
And I'm gonna talk a lot about the hero's journey,

24
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:16,391
the collective unconscious, archetypes,

25
00:01:17,471 --> 00:01:18,552
themes and motivations,

26
00:01:19,432 --> 00:01:21,913
and an actual example of a character profile.

27
00:01:23,029 --> 00:01:26,672
So before we start in the fun stuff of creating visuals,

28
00:01:27,132 --> 00:01:29,214
you really have to understand who your character is.

29
00:01:29,874 --> 00:01:31,996
And Joseph Campbell's monomyth, The Hero's Journey,

30
00:01:32,016 --> 00:01:33,497
you may or may not have heard of this,

31
00:01:34,077 --> 00:01:36,259
but it's extremely important to understand it

32
00:01:36,539 --> 00:01:38,721
before you think about building a hero story.

33
00:01:39,721 --> 00:01:41,002
It is not something you have to use,

34
00:01:41,062 --> 00:01:42,844
but it's a tried and true method.

35
00:01:43,924 --> 00:01:46,886
And the way this works is the hero goes through a loop.

36
00:01:47,987 --> 00:01:50,609
The hero is called to action by an inciting incident,

37
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:52,491
setting them on a new path.

38
00:01:53,351 --> 00:01:56,213
The hero is inspired by mentors and supported by companions

39
00:01:56,934 --> 00:01:57,995
that share this challenge.

40
00:01:58,916 --> 00:02:01,598
And the hero must pass a threshold that tests the resolve,

41
00:02:02,098 --> 00:02:03,339
beginning this transformation.

42
00:02:05,521 --> 00:02:07,182
The next section is you're gonna see

43
00:02:07,342 --> 00:02:08,923
the hero going through challenges

44
00:02:09,323 --> 00:02:11,865
that pushes them past the point of normal human endurance,

45
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:14,147
facing death and despair.

46
00:02:15,457 --> 00:02:19,861
And accomplishing the quest requires a heavy sacrifice and a revelation that will transform

47
00:02:19,901 --> 00:02:20,022
them.

48
00:02:21,043 --> 00:02:22,464
And they return with a new perspective.

49
00:02:22,804 --> 00:02:24,787
Now this loop is important.

50
00:02:25,107 --> 00:02:26,909
You've seen it in a lot of different movies.

51
00:02:26,929 --> 00:02:28,431
We're going to go over that in a second.

52
00:02:29,412 --> 00:02:33,616
But the other angle of this is archetypes and the collective unconscious, a term coined

53
00:02:34,037 --> 00:02:34,737
by Carl Jung.

54
00:02:34,757 --> 00:02:37,520
And it refers to the structures of the unconscious.

55
00:02:38,339 --> 00:02:39,840
which are shared by all human beings.

56
00:02:40,341 --> 00:02:41,122
And according to Jung,

57
00:02:41,582 --> 00:02:45,626
the human collective unconscious is populated by instincts and by archetypes.

58
00:02:46,907 --> 00:02:48,568
So we're going to talk a little bit about those archetypes.

59
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:51,671
So you guys are familiar with Star Wars, I'm sure.

60
00:02:51,931 --> 00:02:53,553
Many of you have seen Star Wars.

61
00:02:54,654 --> 00:02:56,315
The hero's journey,

62
00:02:57,937 --> 00:02:59,058
Joseph Campbell's hero's journey,

63
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:00,679
and Jung's archetypes were...

64
00:03:01,713 --> 00:03:04,014
what George Lucas was really excited to capture.

65
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,195
It wasn't a science fiction story to him.

66
00:03:06,935 --> 00:03:08,536
It was a story about characters,

67
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:10,157
and the characters are the heart

68
00:03:10,237 --> 00:03:12,698
of most great hero stories and myths.

69
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:16,980
So you've seen probably the Harry Potter franchise,

70
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,522
or Lord of the Rings, or even Lost on TV,

71
00:03:20,982 --> 00:03:23,763
and each of these have specific sliced archetypes

72
00:03:23,783 --> 00:03:24,664
that Young's broken down

73
00:03:25,244 --> 00:03:28,946
across all time and all myth and storytelling.

74
00:03:29,633 --> 00:03:35,456
So you have your hero, you have your sidekick, your maiden, your wise old man, your villain,

75
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:43,180
the shapeshifter, the trickster, the comic, the childlike adult, the adultlike child,

76
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,220
and the mother figure.

77
00:03:44,681 --> 00:03:47,762
Now, there's other characters that will populate your stories, but these are archetypes.

78
00:03:48,283 --> 00:03:52,705
And don't get them confused with stereotypes, and they can often go into a stereotype, but

79
00:03:52,805 --> 00:03:53,745
archetypes are important.

80
00:03:53,765 --> 00:03:58,148
They sort of have a set place within a story to help your hero grow.

81
00:04:00,523 --> 00:04:03,464
So the next thing you want to think about is your theme and motivation.

82
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:07,585
So your theme should be a universal truth shared by all cultures,

83
00:04:07,985 --> 00:04:11,865
and your hero should be driven by external and internal motivations.

84
00:04:12,766 --> 00:04:14,066
And they will embark on this journey.

85
00:04:14,346 --> 00:04:15,566
It's going to force change.

86
00:04:17,446 --> 00:04:21,047
So I think about universal themes, and I often go to painting.

87
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:25,668
I studied painting in college, and I feel like the best paintings

88
00:04:25,688 --> 00:04:28,848
in the world express these themes through a very strong image.

89
00:04:29,929 --> 00:04:32,451
So love obviously is a fantastic theme.

90
00:04:32,951 --> 00:04:40,397
Injustice, freedom, honor, liberty,

91
00:04:42,278 --> 00:04:49,904
vengeance, survival, fear, or guilt.

92
00:04:50,464 --> 00:04:53,126
There's many more, but if you notice all of these themes

93
00:04:53,186 --> 00:04:55,648
have strong emotional properties to them.

94
00:04:55,668 --> 00:04:57,730
They're something that you do not need to translate.

95
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,211
Every culture can understand them.

96
00:05:00,824 --> 00:05:03,867
So here's a character profile, a little exercise I'm gonna do with the group.

97
00:05:05,488 --> 00:05:10,552
So in this character's profile, their internal motivation is this hero's parents were killed

98
00:05:10,632 --> 00:05:12,754
by a criminal, causing guilt and fear.

99
00:05:14,195 --> 00:05:18,878
The external motivation, the hero is driven to defend the innocent against criminal predators.

100
00:05:20,299 --> 00:05:25,423
And the theme, the hero uses fear to defeat the internal and external demons.

101
00:05:26,044 --> 00:05:27,605
Anyone, raise your hands, who is this?

102
00:05:29,071 --> 00:05:30,091
Of course, Batman.

103
00:05:30,952 --> 00:05:33,212
Batman's one of my favorite heroes of all time.

104
00:05:34,013 --> 00:05:36,794
And probably because I like the darker side of the hero.

105
00:05:36,854 --> 00:05:38,834
I don't like the tried and true hero.

106
00:05:39,054 --> 00:05:40,855
I like a hero with rough edges.

107
00:05:41,155 --> 00:05:44,356
I like a hero with some humanity and fragility.

108
00:05:45,197 --> 00:05:48,979
and it's their force of will that pushes them forward.

109
00:05:48,999 --> 00:05:53,863
And Batman has no true ability, he has no true superpower,

110
00:05:54,343 --> 00:05:55,684
but he is a superhero.

111
00:05:55,744 --> 00:05:57,085
He does amazing things,

112
00:05:57,145 --> 00:05:59,306
even though Bruce Wayne isn't a regular person.

113
00:05:59,627 --> 00:06:01,868
But he uses the fear, he uses the things

114
00:06:01,948 --> 00:06:05,310
that scared him as a child and incited him

115
00:06:05,351 --> 00:06:07,852
to become this hero against his enemies.

116
00:06:08,192 --> 00:06:09,593
So it's a fantastic loop,

117
00:06:09,874 --> 00:06:11,695
that no matter which media you see Batman in,

118
00:06:12,496 --> 00:06:15,481
this is his core, this is the core of his character

119
00:06:15,601 --> 00:06:16,423
and what motivates him.

120
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,688
So, in this next chapter, we're gonna talk about

121
00:06:19,728 --> 00:06:22,994
a property that I worked on, which is Tomb Raider.

122
00:06:25,168 --> 00:06:27,529
A lot of our charge was to rebuild an icon.

123
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:31,891
Lara Croft has had an amazing run in video games.

124
00:06:33,051 --> 00:06:35,092
She is recognizable, iconic.

125
00:06:36,192 --> 00:06:39,473
She has been seen in all kinds of media, video games,

126
00:06:39,653 --> 00:06:41,394
comic books, movies.

127
00:06:42,294 --> 00:06:43,895
But we wanted to rebuild this icon.

128
00:06:44,095 --> 00:06:46,656
We wanted this, we wanted Lara Croft to be as human

129
00:06:46,676 --> 00:06:47,716
as we could possibly make her.

130
00:06:48,396 --> 00:06:49,877
So we're gonna go through a little bit of a history.

131
00:06:50,657 --> 00:06:52,377
We're gonna talk about charting this new course

132
00:06:52,397 --> 00:06:53,418
we were setting ourselves on.

133
00:06:54,819 --> 00:06:56,761
the archetype inspirations for Lara Croft,

134
00:06:57,661 --> 00:06:59,583
and ultimately this concept that we came up with,

135
00:07:00,424 --> 00:07:02,566
our tagline for the first Tomb Raider reboot

136
00:07:02,626 --> 00:07:03,947
was a survivor is born.

137
00:07:04,747 --> 00:07:07,450
And that's the big flip for our character,

138
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:09,191
is Lara as a survivor.

139
00:07:10,072 --> 00:07:11,233
So, history of Lara Croft.

140
00:07:11,813 --> 00:07:15,336
Toby Garr designed Lara as a smart, athletic archeologist

141
00:07:15,957 --> 00:07:17,738
seeking relics with unimaginable power.

142
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,702
In 96, Tomb Raider was released to critical praise

143
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:23,043
and millions of sales over the world.

144
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:26,896
And for 15 years, she remained ostensibly the same.

145
00:07:27,836 --> 00:07:30,999
She was badass, she was aspirational.

146
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,882
But as she grew in the years,

147
00:07:34,943 --> 00:07:36,224
and more and more games came out,

148
00:07:36,244 --> 00:07:37,825
she became less and less in favor

149
00:07:38,285 --> 00:07:39,466
with the modern gaming audience.

150
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,401
So we wanted to chart a new course.

151
00:07:43,202 --> 00:07:45,863
And my boss at the time at Crystal Dynamics,

152
00:07:46,343 --> 00:07:48,765
Daryl Gallagher, wanted to reimagine Lara

153
00:07:48,845 --> 00:07:51,446
as a young heroine and a believable hero.

154
00:07:52,087 --> 00:07:53,488
And Noah Hughes, the creative director,

155
00:07:54,488 --> 00:07:56,449
and Rihanna Pratchett, the script writer,

156
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:59,631
created an origin story that would feature

157
00:07:59,671 --> 00:08:01,312
a 21-year-old Lara Croft.

158
00:08:02,473 --> 00:08:04,194
And that was great, but we needed a theme,

159
00:08:04,454 --> 00:08:06,435
a theme to build her on, something that was unique.

160
00:08:07,756 --> 00:08:07,916
So.

161
00:08:09,325 --> 00:08:14,050
The next section we talk about is this profile again, trying to come up with a profile, her

162
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:18,794
external motivation, an adventurous archaeologist driven to find the lost secrets of the world.

163
00:08:18,834 --> 00:08:19,474
That's the same.

164
00:08:19,654 --> 00:08:20,435
We didn't touch that.

165
00:08:20,495 --> 00:08:22,357
That was the core of who Lara Croft is.

166
00:08:23,298 --> 00:08:27,301
The internal motivation, she pursues archaeology to finish her father's work and to make her

167
00:08:27,361 --> 00:08:27,742
own mark.

168
00:08:28,182 --> 00:08:32,606
Ultimately, that is very much the same as the classic Lara, but it was the theme.

169
00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:37,231
Shipwrecked on a hostile island, hunted by murderous inhabitants,

170
00:08:37,691 --> 00:08:40,994
Lara must struggle for survival to help her crew escape the island.

171
00:08:41,474 --> 00:08:44,837
The survival theme really is what changed her character,

172
00:08:45,257 --> 00:08:47,259
and everything that we did fed into that theme.

173
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,702
And this is the new icon that we came up with for Lara Croft,

174
00:08:51,722 --> 00:08:53,323
and I'll get to more of that in a moment.

175
00:08:54,885 --> 00:08:56,506
So, archetype inspirations.

176
00:08:57,126 --> 00:08:58,908
Once again, not stereotype, archetypes.

177
00:09:00,095 --> 00:09:04,277
So The Descent is one of our team's favorite horror films.

178
00:09:04,337 --> 00:09:07,358
It was really an amazing study about these women

179
00:09:07,438 --> 00:09:10,260
who had these internal and external demons to fight

180
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:15,282
and their willingness and ability to dig deep and survive.

181
00:09:16,063 --> 00:09:18,204
And there was a lot of visual things about them too

182
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,125
that were really compelling and that climbing ax

183
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:22,566
was a very iconic element of the film

184
00:09:22,986 --> 00:09:24,587
and it's something that we really gravitated to.

185
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,141
But we also looked at Lost.

186
00:09:27,181 --> 00:09:29,423
We were also huge fans of that show at the time.

187
00:09:30,844 --> 00:09:32,966
And Evangeline Lilly played Kate.

188
00:09:33,887 --> 00:09:35,828
And Kate was a complex hero.

189
00:09:36,189 --> 00:09:38,591
She's officially the maiden in the archetype,

190
00:09:39,131 --> 00:09:40,712
but she is sensibly a hero.

191
00:09:41,673 --> 00:09:43,034
And she was relatable.

192
00:09:43,294 --> 00:09:44,055
She was emotional.

193
00:09:44,095 --> 00:09:45,216
She had this emotional depth.

194
00:09:45,656 --> 00:09:46,977
But she also had dark secrets.

195
00:09:47,358 --> 00:09:49,740
So she wasn't just a cookie cutter character.

196
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,141
She actually had complexity.

197
00:09:51,401 --> 00:09:52,382
And the more you got to know her,

198
00:09:52,682 --> 00:09:54,844
the more of those secrets sort of started to unfold.

199
00:09:56,414 --> 00:09:57,835
So I'm gonna do a quick story overview.

200
00:09:57,855 --> 00:09:58,856
I'm gonna get through this quickly.

201
00:09:58,896 --> 00:10:02,159
If you haven't played Tomb Raider, I apologize, big spoilers.

202
00:10:02,619 --> 00:10:03,740
You're gonna, we're gonna go through this whole thing.

203
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,642
Come on, people, it's like a long time ago.

204
00:10:05,662 --> 00:10:07,683
I hope you've at least know the core story.

205
00:10:09,104 --> 00:10:11,947
So Alara begins her archeologist expedition

206
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,808
with a thirst for adventure,

207
00:10:14,108 --> 00:10:15,510
looking for the lost city of Biamatai.

208
00:10:16,715 --> 00:10:19,676
And we created a mentor character for this story.

209
00:10:19,876 --> 00:10:21,036
And this is Conrad Roth.

210
00:10:21,476 --> 00:10:24,677
And he sort of represents what we imagined

211
00:10:24,697 --> 00:10:26,278
a typical Tomb Raider might be.

212
00:10:26,978 --> 00:10:28,359
He actually has the dual pistols.

213
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:29,959
He has the experience.

214
00:10:29,979 --> 00:10:31,480
He has done a ton of treasure hunting.

215
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,420
And he serves as a mentor for Lara Croft.

216
00:10:35,588 --> 00:10:37,909
And then we came up with the concept of a survivor is born.

217
00:10:38,129 --> 00:10:39,870
And this is where the theme really kicks in.

218
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,750
So when the Endurance is scuttled by a storm,

219
00:10:43,491 --> 00:10:46,371
Lara is left alone to fend for herself

220
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:49,512
on this hostile island against hostile inhabitants.

221
00:10:50,433 --> 00:10:52,293
And this opening scene was sort of a metaphor

222
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:53,093
for her rebirth.

223
00:10:53,733 --> 00:10:55,914
She was actually bound in a sack

224
00:10:55,954 --> 00:10:57,575
and had to burn herself to get down.

225
00:10:57,915 --> 00:10:59,115
And she had this terrible event,

226
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:02,016
very painful birth and rebirth of this character.

227
00:11:02,905 --> 00:11:06,866
And that was an important metaphor for us as far as recrafting who she was.

228
00:11:08,147 --> 00:11:10,448
So there was a vulnerability to Lara Croft, and that was new.

229
00:11:11,108 --> 00:11:13,609
Because when we think of Lara Croft, at least in the classic sense,

230
00:11:14,169 --> 00:11:15,150
she was almost invulnerable.

231
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,531
She could backflip her way out of any problem,

232
00:11:17,851 --> 00:11:22,132
use her dual pistols and take names and do the business.

233
00:11:22,953 --> 00:11:24,213
She almost expressed no fear.

234
00:11:24,773 --> 00:11:26,654
And we needed to reset.

235
00:11:26,754 --> 00:11:30,696
We needed to make her experience fear so she had an arc to get to a place

236
00:11:30,936 --> 00:11:32,416
where she would be this confident hero.

237
00:11:33,388 --> 00:11:35,689
And one of those things that we did is we stripped away those dual pistols.

238
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:37,630
That was an iconic part of her character,

239
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:39,650
and we completely removed them for this game.

240
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:42,471
And what we did is we replaced them with new tools.

241
00:11:42,731 --> 00:11:44,572
So the fire was the first tool that she got.

242
00:11:45,272 --> 00:11:47,413
And she used that tool to escape the den.

243
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,033
And then she eventually discovered the bow.

244
00:11:50,574 --> 00:11:52,734
And the bow is also another iconic new element.

245
00:11:53,094 --> 00:11:56,135
And both of these tools reinforced our theme of survival.

246
00:11:58,238 --> 00:12:02,099
So in that hero's journey, she had to cross a threshold.

247
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,561
She had to go to a place where she could not come back from.

248
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,201
And that really came down to the point

249
00:12:06,441 --> 00:12:08,162
where she had to kill a person for the first time.

250
00:12:08,742 --> 00:12:10,643
So Lara Croft, up until this point in our fiction,

251
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:11,984
has never killed a person,

252
00:12:12,344 --> 00:12:14,165
and this was an important part of her arc.

253
00:12:15,105 --> 00:12:16,326
She passed this threshold,

254
00:12:17,186 --> 00:12:19,927
and that really set her on her hero's journey.

255
00:12:21,788 --> 00:12:23,849
Her best friend, Samantha, was captured by Matthias,

256
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:24,269
her villain.

257
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:28,088
And this is part of a trope of the story,

258
00:12:28,168 --> 00:12:31,251
but this is the captured maiden part of the loop.

259
00:12:32,092 --> 00:12:33,273
And she has to rescue Sam

260
00:12:33,654 --> 00:12:35,115
before they can leave this island.

261
00:12:37,081 --> 00:12:39,943
Now the mentor's challenge, this is where a mentor becomes really important.

262
00:12:40,584 --> 00:12:44,687
Because not only are they there as an aspirational figure, but they're there to give you challenges.

263
00:12:45,108 --> 00:12:49,692
And the thing that was great about this was we used that not only narratively, but we

264
00:12:49,752 --> 00:12:50,613
used it in gameplay.

265
00:12:51,133 --> 00:12:55,517
So each tool that Lara got, whether it be the torch, which was fire, or the bow, which

266
00:12:55,537 --> 00:13:00,441
gave her long, gave her shooting ability, she eventually got this axe from her mentor,

267
00:13:00,461 --> 00:13:01,182
Conrad Roth.

268
00:13:01,762 --> 00:13:03,283
And this axe represented not only a...

269
00:13:05,089 --> 00:13:09,050
a symbol of his trust, but it was also an important tool for her to scale the mountain

270
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:11,771
and eventually reach her first challenge.

271
00:13:13,331 --> 00:13:15,972
So she had to face this challenge of the hostile island alone.

272
00:13:16,152 --> 00:13:21,233
Conrad Roth had been injured, and she had to send this SOS, and the fate of her crew

273
00:13:21,273 --> 00:13:22,073
was in her hands.

274
00:13:22,813 --> 00:13:27,774
So this was an important thing to see her start to embrace what it means to be a hero

275
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:29,375
and to grow as a character.

276
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,371
Ultimately, she gets to that challenge.

277
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:35,132
She finishes the mentor's challenge.

278
00:13:35,172 --> 00:13:36,352
She gets out the SOS.

279
00:13:36,392 --> 00:13:39,813
There's a moment of jubilation, of relief,

280
00:13:39,873 --> 00:13:41,173
because we've been so dark.

281
00:13:41,393 --> 00:13:43,134
The characters had so much hardship

282
00:13:43,694 --> 00:13:45,214
that we gave a little beacon of hope.

283
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:48,195
And we did everything, not only in her character arc,

284
00:13:48,455 --> 00:13:49,455
to feel that confidence,

285
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,975
but also in the way we set the world.

286
00:13:51,555 --> 00:13:53,236
We really brought in light and color,

287
00:13:53,296 --> 00:13:55,256
and we wanted that moment to feel celebrated.

288
00:13:55,896 --> 00:13:57,217
But this was a short-lived victory.

289
00:13:58,888 --> 00:14:03,851
This plane that she had called in was taken down by a supernatural threat.

290
00:14:04,192 --> 00:14:05,713
Once again, we're escalating the threats,

291
00:14:05,773 --> 00:14:08,294
and we're forcing Lara to understand

292
00:14:08,334 --> 00:14:11,196
that it's not going to be an easy thing for her to finish her journey.

293
00:14:12,717 --> 00:14:15,900
She's going to go through a series of these trials and tribulations,

294
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,881
ever escalating, ever getting to the point

295
00:14:17,921 --> 00:14:20,803
where she's driven to the edge of human endurance.

296
00:14:22,104 --> 00:14:25,546
But she is also driven to save her companions, and she pushes through.

297
00:14:27,342 --> 00:14:30,586
She's ultimately captured and gets to a point

298
00:14:30,626 --> 00:14:33,469
where she is at the lowest part of the story.

299
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:37,935
But she reemerges really understanding

300
00:14:37,975 --> 00:14:39,316
what it means to be a survivor.

301
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:41,799
We start to see a physical transformation in her character.

302
00:14:43,941 --> 00:14:45,221
And then she's more steel.

303
00:14:45,241 --> 00:14:46,962
We're starting to see classic elements

304
00:14:47,022 --> 00:14:48,142
of Lara Croft come through.

305
00:14:48,442 --> 00:14:49,763
She's taking the fight to the enemy.

306
00:14:49,803 --> 00:14:52,203
She's no longer waiting to be attacked.

307
00:14:52,223 --> 00:14:54,584
She's taking it to them, and she's being proactive.

308
00:14:55,024 --> 00:14:57,165
So this is how we start to see that evolution

309
00:14:57,205 --> 00:15:00,506
in her character, which makes her interesting.

310
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:06,465
So this is the most important lesson for her in her arc,

311
00:15:06,545 --> 00:15:07,505
is her mentor's death.

312
00:15:08,206 --> 00:15:09,907
This is classic in multiple stories,

313
00:15:10,548 --> 00:15:12,910
but it puts her in a situation

314
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,411
where she learns an important lesson,

315
00:15:15,351 --> 00:15:18,013
that she hopes to get everyone off the island alive,

316
00:15:18,073 --> 00:15:20,756
and that's almost a naive thought or feeling,

317
00:15:21,436 --> 00:15:24,859
because in this journey, something has to be sacrificed.

318
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:26,260
She's gonna lose friends,

319
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,222
and she has to come to terms with those losses.

320
00:15:31,268 --> 00:15:33,589
So we've added another archetype, the turn code in here.

321
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:37,072
One of our own crew actually turns Samantha over

322
00:15:37,112 --> 00:15:40,414
to the enemy, and Lara kills this enemy

323
00:15:40,594 --> 00:15:42,696
using the weapons of her slain mentor.

324
00:15:44,397 --> 00:15:48,379
And we give the players a glimpse of her potential future.

325
00:15:48,459 --> 00:15:50,241
We give her the classic silhouette,

326
00:15:50,281 --> 00:15:51,842
that Lara Croft with the dual pistols.

327
00:15:52,382 --> 00:15:54,964
But she's not there yet, but this is a glimpse

328
00:15:55,364 --> 00:15:57,546
of her future and her destiny.

329
00:15:58,406 --> 00:16:00,628
She's gonna face one last supernatural threat.

330
00:16:02,008 --> 00:16:05,170
taking her out, and she will save her friend.

331
00:16:06,331 --> 00:16:08,253
But they've both been scarred by this adventure.

332
00:16:08,913 --> 00:16:11,515
They escape the island with not their full crew,

333
00:16:12,256 --> 00:16:14,057
and Lara feels the guilt of this loss.

334
00:16:15,418 --> 00:16:17,780
And her thirst for adventure will transform more

335
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,043
into a passion to ever uncover the world's secrets

336
00:16:21,463 --> 00:16:23,865
because they are dangerous and she needs to understand them.

337
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:26,287
She leaves the island with more questions than answers.

338
00:16:27,931 --> 00:16:30,291
So that was just a little bit of a loop

339
00:16:30,471 --> 00:16:32,732
of how we eventually got there with Lara Croft.

340
00:16:33,352 --> 00:16:34,752
But let's click back.

341
00:16:34,812 --> 00:16:37,213
We have to think about how we actually brought her to life.

342
00:16:37,673 --> 00:16:39,093
So that's a story, that's the context,

343
00:16:39,113 --> 00:16:41,834
that's the wrapper that we're going to put this hero into.

344
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:44,754
But we had to design her, we had to come up with the visuals,

345
00:16:45,114 --> 00:16:47,695
how far we were gonna push away from what she was

346
00:16:48,195 --> 00:16:50,375
to where she was going to be for this new incarnation.

347
00:16:51,055 --> 00:16:52,876
So we wanted to design a human hero,

348
00:16:53,616 --> 00:16:56,397
and we had to do a ton of iteration to get to that point.

349
00:16:57,664 --> 00:17:01,126
And we pushed further in the realm of realism

350
00:17:01,527 --> 00:17:04,009
by introducing models and wardrobe

351
00:17:04,029 --> 00:17:05,110
and things that we've never seen

352
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,411
in the Tomb Raider franchise before

353
00:17:06,811 --> 00:17:08,853
to bring her one more step to realism.

354
00:17:09,453 --> 00:17:12,756
Now this title of this story, of this presentation

355
00:17:12,796 --> 00:17:13,937
is creating a believable hero.

356
00:17:14,718 --> 00:17:19,022
These themes, these ideas don't necessarily have to feed into a realistic game.

357
00:17:19,082 --> 00:17:21,965
It just so happens that Tomb Raider was going for a realistic aesthetic.

358
00:17:22,486 --> 00:17:27,671
But The Incredibles has, as a very stylized movie, has a lot of these same principles in it.

359
00:17:28,012 --> 00:17:31,515
So if you have a stylized game you're working on, a lot of these principles will also work.

360
00:17:33,058 --> 00:17:35,800
So when we design this hero, it comes down to people.

361
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:38,763
And I can't express enough how important

362
00:17:39,304 --> 00:17:41,446
Bren Adams was to this whole process.

363
00:17:41,486 --> 00:17:43,928
He was the assistant art director on Tomb Raider.

364
00:17:44,008 --> 00:17:45,629
He was my right-hand man.

365
00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:47,811
And ultimately, a lot of the visuals

366
00:17:47,831 --> 00:17:49,813
that you see for Lara Croft come from him.

367
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:53,056
And I was just very fortunate to work with him and Cam Yu,

368
00:17:53,717 --> 00:17:55,739
who was a longtime modeler of Lara Croft,

369
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:57,020
going back all the way to Legend.

370
00:17:58,002 --> 00:18:00,764
So having a group of people that you can trust,

371
00:18:00,784 --> 00:18:01,785
that can push each other,

372
00:18:02,185 --> 00:18:03,326
that's a really important thing

373
00:18:03,346 --> 00:18:05,188
when you're talking about a task like this.

374
00:18:05,228 --> 00:18:06,229
You can do it on your own,

375
00:18:06,629 --> 00:18:08,110
but it's great to have collaborators.

376
00:18:09,571 --> 00:18:10,672
And we started with silhouettes.

377
00:18:11,332 --> 00:18:13,294
And what you're gonna see in these early silhouettes

378
00:18:13,334 --> 00:18:15,996
is they look very familiar to an older Lara Croft,

379
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:17,918
or to a classic rendition of Lara Croft.

380
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:22,591
Bren was just pushing the idea of how far we wanted to go with her character.

381
00:18:23,231 --> 00:18:24,372
So you have your signature elements.

382
00:18:24,392 --> 00:18:25,252
You have your ponytail.

383
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:26,433
You have the M-shaped lips.

384
00:18:26,473 --> 00:18:27,974
You have the dual pistols.

385
00:18:28,834 --> 00:18:30,795
And you have the silhouette, which looks very familiar.

386
00:18:32,036 --> 00:18:33,016
Then we started to iterate.

387
00:18:33,116 --> 00:18:35,137
We started to think, how could we continue pushing it?

388
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:36,798
We cut off her hair at one point.

389
00:18:37,139 --> 00:18:38,639
Hey, can we lose the ponytail?

390
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,820
Can we give her a child companion?

391
00:18:41,701 --> 00:18:42,841
Can we even give her a monkey?

392
00:18:44,622 --> 00:18:45,143
I'm not kidding you.

393
00:18:45,183 --> 00:18:46,563
That was actually in there at one point.

394
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:47,844
She was going to have a monkey.

395
00:18:49,101 --> 00:18:50,662
It's crazy, but it was really funny.

396
00:18:50,682 --> 00:18:52,022
I had to put it in the PowerPoint.

397
00:18:54,123 --> 00:18:55,884
So we kept going, we kept pushing,

398
00:18:56,224 --> 00:18:59,645
and the axe, the descent film came into focus for us.

399
00:19:00,065 --> 00:19:01,766
We brought the axe into the silhouette,

400
00:19:01,806 --> 00:19:02,966
and that was looking interesting.

401
00:19:03,446 --> 00:19:04,907
We were looking at ideas of like,

402
00:19:04,947 --> 00:19:06,227
maybe she would break her bones.

403
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:07,888
How do we express survival?

404
00:19:07,908 --> 00:19:09,829
We kept thinking about survival, survival.

405
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,590
and then we realized that would really suck for gameplay

406
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:15,092
to have her having broken bones, so we didn't do that.

407
00:19:15,852 --> 00:19:17,333
But we did want to keep pushing,

408
00:19:18,174 --> 00:19:20,616
and ultimately we came down to the ideas of,

409
00:19:20,636 --> 00:19:22,617
well, what if she was just progressing through the game?

410
00:19:22,997 --> 00:19:24,758
And it wasn't affecting her control,

411
00:19:25,219 --> 00:19:27,700
but you would see as she went through,

412
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,562
the signs of the wear and tear of the island

413
00:19:30,622 --> 00:19:32,323
and the adventurist would start to progress on her.

414
00:19:32,863 --> 00:19:34,424
Now, this wasn't the final incarnation,

415
00:19:34,444 --> 00:19:36,166
but it was a really interesting exercise

416
00:19:36,606 --> 00:19:38,027
at how you think about progression

417
00:19:38,487 --> 00:19:39,408
from the beginning to end.

418
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:43,264
And ultimately we came to our final design.

419
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:46,906
And we came up with what I believe is a new silhouette.

420
00:19:47,826 --> 00:19:49,827
You could take this down to just black and white,

421
00:19:49,927 --> 00:19:51,528
which I probably should have done for the PowerPoint,

422
00:19:51,548 --> 00:19:52,288
but I forgot to do it,

423
00:19:53,509 --> 00:19:55,850
where you could see Lara with the two pistols

424
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,290
and Lara with the bow on her back

425
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:59,331
and the axe in one hand.

426
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:01,092
And we created a new silhouette,

427
00:20:01,172 --> 00:20:02,952
a new icon for Lara Croft.

428
00:20:05,734 --> 00:20:09,135
And as we kept iterating, we did head turns.

429
00:20:10,158 --> 00:20:13,600
We talked about gear and how the gear would add to the character.

430
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:17,042
And even little small details like this little necklace.

431
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:18,242
It was something we designed.

432
00:20:18,803 --> 00:20:19,923
We didn't have a story for it.

433
00:20:20,283 --> 00:20:22,545
And then the writer saw that necklace and said, oh, that's really cool.

434
00:20:22,945 --> 00:20:24,766
And they wrote a whole back story for the necklace

435
00:20:25,046 --> 00:20:27,227
about it was her first archaeological discovery.

436
00:20:27,547 --> 00:20:31,389
And sort of was her inciting incident to fall in love with archaeology.

437
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:32,570
So she wears that.

438
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,171
And that's an important part of her character.

439
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,291
It helped define who she is.

440
00:20:36,885 --> 00:20:39,805
But the bow, and this is a Rise of the Tomb Raider concept,

441
00:20:39,825 --> 00:20:41,266
so this is gonna be mixing, matching

442
00:20:41,326 --> 00:20:42,866
some of the old stuff and the new stuff.

443
00:20:43,406 --> 00:20:45,707
But every piece of gear that we put on her body,

444
00:20:45,727 --> 00:20:47,147
we wanted to make sure told a story.

445
00:20:48,828 --> 00:20:50,868
And the axe, as I talked about, was an important one.

446
00:20:51,328 --> 00:20:52,589
Not only was it an important tool,

447
00:20:52,629 --> 00:20:54,009
but it was something her mentor gave her.

448
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:58,830
Now, for the companions, we ended up

449
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,611
with a very large secondary cast,

450
00:21:00,671 --> 00:21:03,011
larger than we actually probably should have had.

451
00:21:03,412 --> 00:21:05,412
But we were filling the archetype roles.

452
00:21:06,487 --> 00:21:08,449
And each one of them served a function.

453
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:12,714
The mentor, the maiden, the sidekick, the turncoat, the comic, the childlike adult,

454
00:21:12,734 --> 00:21:14,275
the adultlike child, and the mother figure.

455
00:21:14,655 --> 00:21:15,636
All of them are represented.

456
00:21:16,077 --> 00:21:20,321
And I think we did a really bad job at describing these characters and they became stereotypes.

457
00:21:20,401 --> 00:21:25,986
They weren't the best expression of what we hoped and aspired to do, but they were all

458
00:21:26,027 --> 00:21:26,187
there.

459
00:21:26,887 --> 00:21:30,149
So, you shoot for the stars, sometimes you pick a lane and you go,

460
00:21:30,209 --> 00:21:31,890
we want to do all this stuff and then we realize

461
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:34,351
we weren't giving them enough screen time.

462
00:21:34,831 --> 00:21:37,113
There wasn't enough opportunity for you to fall in love with them

463
00:21:37,533 --> 00:21:38,794
and they fell into stereotype.

464
00:21:39,334 --> 00:21:42,135
So it's an important thing to know that even though you might have

465
00:21:42,155 --> 00:21:43,796
the best intentions and follow the book,

466
00:21:44,677 --> 00:21:48,363
Execution is still everything when it comes to realizing your characters.

467
00:21:48,804 --> 00:21:51,889
But what we think we got right were at least two of them in this crew,

468
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,574
which was the mentor Roth and Lara.

469
00:21:54,754 --> 00:21:58,120
And we think we did a pretty good job describing those two characters.

470
00:21:59,248 --> 00:22:01,650
When it came to the enemies, we struggled a lot with,

471
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:02,690
who are these enemies?

472
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,111
Why are they important to Lara?

473
00:22:04,431 --> 00:22:05,552
What do they do to challenge her?

474
00:22:06,172 --> 00:22:08,573
And what we realized is, to make them as compelling,

475
00:22:09,074 --> 00:22:10,975
they had to be survivors of the island as well.

476
00:22:11,175 --> 00:22:13,736
They were also shipwrecked on this island,

477
00:22:14,036 --> 00:22:16,057
and they became indoctrinated into this cult.

478
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:19,159
And one of my favorite pieces of storytelling

479
00:22:19,199 --> 00:22:20,419
that we did in the game was,

480
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,482
we got to see how the Salari soldiers were indoctrinated.

481
00:22:24,882 --> 00:22:27,463
They were put into this pit of despair and forced,

482
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:35,006
to survive a brutal existence and it almost drove them mad.

483
00:22:35,386 --> 00:22:40,992
And if they survived that terrible pit of despair, that they would be good enough to

484
00:22:41,072 --> 00:22:43,414
fight in Matthias' army and be willing to do anything.

485
00:22:43,835 --> 00:22:48,119
So if you're a fan of The Walking Dead right now, that is essentially what you're seeing

486
00:22:48,479 --> 00:22:49,260
with the enemy types.

487
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:54,225
Negan will beat down these people until they're just broken and shattered.

488
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:55,366
And then who are they?

489
00:22:55,406 --> 00:22:55,987
They're Negan.

490
00:22:56,207 --> 00:22:57,108
They're all Negan.

491
00:22:57,428 --> 00:22:59,370
And that's before we knew about that.

492
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:03,855
But man, I wish I would have had that at the time because that's exactly what we wanted

493
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:10,181
to try to do with the Solari was to make human beings that are shattered and rebuilt under

494
00:23:10,221 --> 00:23:11,442
this malevolent leader.

495
00:23:14,069 --> 00:23:16,231
And then when it came to the Oni, the supernatural enemy,

496
00:23:16,511 --> 00:23:17,652
we wanted to make them,

497
00:23:18,493 --> 00:23:20,435
we didn't want any visible signs of magic.

498
00:23:21,155 --> 00:23:24,078
We really pushed away, like we did a lot of experimentation

499
00:23:24,098 --> 00:23:25,719
with how much magic would be in the game.

500
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,522
And we said, man, every time we add it,

501
00:23:28,622 --> 00:23:30,804
it feels like it's, it just broke the bubble.

502
00:23:31,565 --> 00:23:32,105
We lost.

503
00:23:33,086 --> 00:23:34,807
we lost that cohesiveness.

504
00:23:35,508 --> 00:23:38,070
So the oni were essentially samurais, but immortal.

505
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:40,312
And what we did is we just used their behaviors.

506
00:23:40,372 --> 00:23:41,432
We made them more feral.

507
00:23:41,452 --> 00:23:43,234
We made them less disciplined as a way

508
00:23:43,274 --> 00:23:44,715
to express their immortality.

509
00:23:45,055 --> 00:23:48,518
So it was this contrast of samurai-looking characters

510
00:23:48,778 --> 00:23:50,940
that acted and behaved a lot like animals.

511
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:56,564
So that was our way to express their supernatural qualities.

512
00:23:56,984 --> 00:23:58,646
At the end, we just, at the very end,

513
00:23:58,686 --> 00:23:59,666
we talk about Himiko.

514
00:24:00,032 --> 00:24:02,456
and the queen, and that's where we get the most supernatural.

515
00:24:02,496 --> 00:24:04,338
But we really protect that until the very end.

516
00:24:05,841 --> 00:24:08,204
But ultimately, the most important character

517
00:24:08,264 --> 00:24:10,127
next to Lara Croft is the environment.

518
00:24:10,628 --> 00:24:12,290
And I cannot express this enough.

519
00:24:12,771 --> 00:24:14,553
When you're designing your hero, you

520
00:24:14,613 --> 00:24:16,276
have to think about the environment that they're in.

521
00:24:17,842 --> 00:24:20,563
Everything that Lara does, everything your hero will do,

522
00:24:21,184 --> 00:24:24,846
should be, the environment itself should be a challenge

523
00:24:25,066 --> 00:24:27,527
or a compliment to something you're trying to express

524
00:24:27,587 --> 00:24:28,688
in their story arc.

525
00:24:29,128 --> 00:24:31,410
And I think this is probably the second most successful

526
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:33,291
character we created in the game was the environment.

527
00:24:33,651 --> 00:24:35,312
Yamatai itself had a life to it.

528
00:24:35,352 --> 00:24:38,053
It had this dynamic weather, it had hostility.

529
00:24:38,534 --> 00:24:39,514
It was aesthetically.

530
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:42,236
just it had darkness to it.

531
00:24:42,777 --> 00:24:43,477
And it would progress.

532
00:24:43,517 --> 00:24:45,118
It wasn't just one look all the way through.

533
00:24:45,379 --> 00:24:46,679
We went through different weather states.

534
00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:48,261
We went through different architecture styles.

535
00:24:49,161 --> 00:24:51,203
But ultimately what we came to was an environment

536
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:53,885
that we felt we called the second most important character

537
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:54,305
in the game.

538
00:24:54,885 --> 00:24:58,228
And that was Lara's best enemy in Tomb Raider.

539
00:25:00,029 --> 00:25:01,290
OK, so the next section.

540
00:25:02,711 --> 00:25:04,773
We had to cast Lara Croft.

541
00:25:04,813 --> 00:25:07,715
We had to bring an actor into our.

542
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:14,878
into the fold that was going to embody what is a young Lara Croft look and act like.

543
00:25:15,478 --> 00:25:20,543
And we went through an exhaustive list of actors, and we had Camilla come in, and she

544
00:25:20,563 --> 00:25:22,104
was sort of reading for us.

545
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:28,029
It's almost like a Han Solo thing, where Han Solo was being, Harrison Ford was not originally

546
00:25:28,049 --> 00:25:31,451
considered for the role, and there was this person that, you know, Harrison was just reading

547
00:25:31,511 --> 00:25:33,433
against other people, and like, well, what about Harrison Ford?

548
00:25:33,753 --> 00:25:37,276
Camilla was kind of like that, where she was, came in very early, and

549
00:25:39,207 --> 00:25:40,407
We were looking at other candidates,

550
00:25:40,507 --> 00:25:41,808
and then ultimately came back to Camilla

551
00:25:41,848 --> 00:25:43,589
because she had this truth and honesty

552
00:25:43,629 --> 00:25:47,691
and simplicity about her performance that we really loved.

553
00:25:48,351 --> 00:25:51,413
And we didn't want her to feel like a superhero

554
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:53,574
or a confident person in the beginning,

555
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:55,235
and we wanted her to get there.

556
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:57,176
So Camilla was a very young actress,

557
00:25:57,676 --> 00:25:59,857
and she's now done many things,

558
00:25:59,957 --> 00:26:02,839
you know, Grey's Anatomy and a number of other things,

559
00:26:02,899 --> 00:26:04,640
but at the time, she was completely unknown.

560
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,761
So we were very fortunate to cast Camilla

561
00:26:06,981 --> 00:26:08,342
and bring life to the character.

562
00:26:09,558 --> 00:26:12,341
And then for the visualization, we cast a number of models.

563
00:26:12,381 --> 00:26:18,166
This is across two games, to serve as face and body

564
00:26:18,646 --> 00:26:20,548
likeness, or at least reference.

565
00:26:20,908 --> 00:26:22,930
Because we wanted Lara Croft to still be unique.

566
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,471
There was not one actor out there

567
00:26:24,511 --> 00:26:27,674
that was going to fulfill our goals for Lara.

568
00:26:27,814 --> 00:26:28,815
So she was a composite.

569
00:26:30,296 --> 00:26:34,139
And we had Megan that she served as the base morphology

570
00:26:34,179 --> 00:26:34,680
of the face.

571
00:26:35,958 --> 00:26:43,246
For Rise of the Tomb Raider, we did even more work towards wardrobe and every single garment

572
00:26:43,266 --> 00:26:45,169
that Lara wore was scanned.

573
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:50,474
And I feel like that was a really important part of pushing what I call clothes, not costumes.

574
00:26:51,396 --> 00:26:55,700
For believability, I think it's extremely important that your characters don't feel

575
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,842
like they're wearing a costume.

576
00:26:57,442 --> 00:26:58,983
And that's something that you'll see in films

577
00:26:59,403 --> 00:27:02,804
when they translate from a comic book into a film,

578
00:27:03,084 --> 00:27:04,545
that those things become more practical.

579
00:27:04,585 --> 00:27:06,146
You'll see the iconic elements,

580
00:27:06,606 --> 00:27:10,347
but ultimately they feel more like a garment

581
00:27:10,387 --> 00:27:10,948
that could be made.

582
00:27:11,908 --> 00:27:13,409
So we actually bought clothes off the rack,

583
00:27:13,969 --> 00:27:16,670
augmented them, but they serve as a foundation

584
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:18,731
to create what I believe is something

585
00:27:18,751 --> 00:27:20,131
that looks much more authentic.

586
00:27:21,972 --> 00:27:23,412
Here's the scan for the head for Megan.

587
00:27:24,153 --> 00:27:25,493
Facial expression references.

588
00:27:27,967 --> 00:27:33,189
More scan work for the torso, the jacket, the pants.

589
00:27:33,729 --> 00:27:35,969
Now this is an important slide because I had this idea.

590
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:37,870
I wasn't sure if we could pull it off,

591
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:41,031
but I really wanted to see the wrinkles in her pants

592
00:27:41,351 --> 00:27:42,631
articulate as she moved.

593
00:27:43,431 --> 00:27:45,732
And we've seen wrinkle maps before in games,

594
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:47,972
but I really wanted to push beyond just wrinkle maps.

595
00:27:48,012 --> 00:27:50,893
I wanted to see blend shape changes plus wrinkle maps.

596
00:27:51,713 --> 00:27:53,735
And while I don't think we got 100% there,

597
00:27:54,135 --> 00:27:56,476
these scans provided a really interesting

598
00:27:57,136 --> 00:27:57,997
reference point for us.

599
00:27:58,437 --> 00:28:00,258
As you can see, the difference between the folds

600
00:28:00,518 --> 00:28:01,499
from one leg to the other,

601
00:28:01,859 --> 00:28:04,160
that's a drastic difference as they're articulating.

602
00:28:04,561 --> 00:28:05,521
So we did bring this,

603
00:28:06,141 --> 00:28:08,603
we brought new technology into Rise of the Tomb Raider

604
00:28:08,943 --> 00:28:12,205
to try to bring this articulation and fold logic,

605
00:28:12,625 --> 00:28:14,006
dynamic fold logic into the game.

606
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:16,867
This was the scan to model.

607
00:28:17,288 --> 00:28:19,609
So how the scan and the head model was fused.

608
00:28:20,765 --> 00:28:22,825
And here's that example of the deformation

609
00:28:22,845 --> 00:28:24,106
and the wrinkle maps and how they worked.

610
00:28:24,666 --> 00:28:26,727
This is kind of a techie slide,

611
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:29,327
even though this presentation is more about theory.

612
00:28:30,468 --> 00:28:31,788
It was just a small detail

613
00:28:31,828 --> 00:28:34,069
that the team was passionate about.

614
00:28:34,149 --> 00:28:37,370
And I think what happens when you're making these games

615
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:40,011
is it's the small stuff sometimes that people love.

616
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:41,932
So that was just one thing.

617
00:28:42,412 --> 00:28:43,532
We brought that into the body

618
00:28:43,572 --> 00:28:45,693
where you could see different wrinkles from her torso

619
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:47,033
as she twists.

620
00:28:47,553 --> 00:28:49,614
And even her arms had muscle deformation.

621
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:56,083
And here's some of the game models from Rise of the Tomb Raider using the in-game renderer.

622
00:28:59,729 --> 00:29:05,275
It was exciting for us because we had established a really interesting game in the first one

623
00:29:05,635 --> 00:29:10,560
and to continue to build on it was a joy because we had figured out a lot of the hard stuff.

624
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,224
The rest of it was like, well how would you have different outfits for Lara Croft and

625
00:29:15,264 --> 00:29:18,608
what would they look like and how do you make sure that it doesn't look like costumes and

626
00:29:18,628 --> 00:29:19,629
it does feel like clothes.

627
00:29:20,229 --> 00:29:23,052
So we were able to get from the first one she wore a tank top the whole time.

628
00:29:23,532 --> 00:29:26,034
we really got to see her evolve and be prepared

629
00:29:26,254 --> 00:29:27,294
going into an expedition.

630
00:29:27,815 --> 00:29:31,097
And that was a big difference in how we approached the sequel.

631
00:29:32,918 --> 00:29:34,318
And then you're starting to see distress.

632
00:29:34,358 --> 00:29:36,099
This was another really important thing

633
00:29:36,219 --> 00:29:38,741
for believability and grounding the character to the world.

634
00:29:39,822 --> 00:29:41,302
So we had our shaders.

635
00:29:41,422 --> 00:29:43,243
And this isn't a new technology, but it's something

636
00:29:43,283 --> 00:29:46,385
we're really committed to, is every time that Laura

637
00:29:46,425 --> 00:29:47,726
goes into a new environment, she'll

638
00:29:47,746 --> 00:29:50,528
have these dynamic shaders that reflect the environment.

639
00:29:50,548 --> 00:29:53,069
So if it starts to snow, you'll see snow accumulation.

640
00:29:53,688 --> 00:29:55,790
It's raining, the rain will make the clothes wet,

641
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:57,391
muddy, bloody, et cetera.

642
00:29:58,312 --> 00:30:00,854
So here's an example of Lara in distress state

643
00:30:01,514 --> 00:30:03,816
where she has the blood and mud and dirt

644
00:30:03,836 --> 00:30:04,697
and scratches on her.

645
00:30:05,417 --> 00:30:06,999
And to see these things come in and out

646
00:30:07,099 --> 00:30:09,561
based on her damage, it was just a really cool,

647
00:30:09,881 --> 00:30:15,325
new approach to reflect the game

648
00:30:15,365 --> 00:30:16,746
that you, the player, were playing

649
00:30:17,067 --> 00:30:19,949
that your character felt connected to your actions.

650
00:30:21,795 --> 00:30:24,338
Even small stuff like Fresnel shader on the clothes,

651
00:30:24,378 --> 00:30:26,721
that little peach fuzzy feel that clothes get

652
00:30:27,241 --> 00:30:28,983
that separate them from the skin,

653
00:30:29,303 --> 00:30:30,905
which has subsurface scattering.

654
00:30:31,285 --> 00:30:32,827
These aren't new technologies per se,

655
00:30:32,847 --> 00:30:33,968
but I just bring them up because.

656
00:30:34,947 --> 00:30:37,868
you have to sort of get into a bare minimum of tech

657
00:30:38,189 --> 00:30:39,969
when you're talking about building a realistic game

658
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:43,951
where these features add up to creating

659
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:46,672
a more believable looking realistic character.

660
00:30:47,132 --> 00:30:48,733
Once again, you don't have to,

661
00:30:48,893 --> 00:30:50,294
if you're not making a realistic game,

662
00:30:50,314 --> 00:30:51,414
you don't need all of these things.

663
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:53,675
But even the Incredibles had subsurface scattering

664
00:30:53,695 --> 00:30:55,276
and Fresnel shaders and all the stuff

665
00:30:55,296 --> 00:30:56,957
that I'm talking about to try to take

666
00:30:56,977 --> 00:30:58,777
their cartoony silhouettes into something

667
00:30:58,797 --> 00:30:59,558
that feels more real.

668
00:31:01,037 --> 00:31:04,760
And then this is something, an innovation that we worked on for the PC version of Tomb

669
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:08,123
Raider, and we brought into Rise of the Tomb Raider, which was spline-based hair.

670
00:31:08,903 --> 00:31:14,808
One of the biggest iconic elements of Lara Croft is her hair, and we really feel like

671
00:31:14,848 --> 00:31:16,229
we've struck a chord.

672
00:31:16,489 --> 00:31:20,352
you know, a really important thing in the games industry is to continue to push the

673
00:31:20,392 --> 00:31:24,836
technology to see more secondary motion and more believable motion happen on characters.

674
00:31:25,336 --> 00:31:29,540
And the spline-based hair might not be for every game, but for Tomb Raider, we were willing

675
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:37,746
to pay the expense to see a much more articulate physics simulation and physical rendering.

676
00:31:38,347 --> 00:31:40,107
So every single condition that you see,

677
00:31:40,128 --> 00:31:43,429
the spline hair is reacted to wind and to wetness.

678
00:31:43,769 --> 00:31:45,450
You'll see all those conditions change

679
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:46,571
because we were able to build

680
00:31:46,611 --> 00:31:48,171
such a robust system for the hair.

681
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:52,302
And for the game model itself, we could go into the details.

682
00:31:52,342 --> 00:31:53,603
I mean, ultimately, I don't think

683
00:31:53,663 --> 00:31:56,624
Lara is a realistic or photo-realistic character.

684
00:31:57,144 --> 00:31:59,125
She's, we're trying to strive for believability.

685
00:31:59,205 --> 00:32:02,086
So there is an abstraction, even though we're getting

686
00:32:02,146 --> 00:32:03,806
more and more real, that we're taking,

687
00:32:03,966 --> 00:32:05,647
she's not quite to the point where you could take

688
00:32:05,687 --> 00:32:07,567
a photograph of someone and that's Lara Croft.

689
00:32:07,908 --> 00:32:09,188
So that was one of the big challenges

690
00:32:09,568 --> 00:32:10,748
for the character team on the game,

691
00:32:11,169 --> 00:32:16,190
was riding the line of iconography and realism.

692
00:32:17,059 --> 00:32:18,480
And this is one of the in-game cinematics.

693
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,023
We're really stoked to continue pushing

694
00:32:21,083 --> 00:32:23,265
real-time cinematics in Tomb Raider

695
00:32:23,685 --> 00:32:26,668
because it allowed your choices to be reflected on the model.

696
00:32:27,168 --> 00:32:29,430
So if you ever play Tomb Raider or Rise of the Tomb Raider

697
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:31,031
and you change your outfit,

698
00:32:31,432 --> 00:32:32,613
every single one of those cinematics

699
00:32:32,673 --> 00:32:34,114
is gonna reflect your outfit choice.

700
00:32:34,735 --> 00:32:36,216
And I know it's another small detail,

701
00:32:36,256 --> 00:32:38,538
but it really makes you feel connected to that character.

702
00:32:38,918 --> 00:32:41,279
It makes you feel like that's your version of Lara Croft.

703
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:42,139
It's who you're playing.

704
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,940
We were able to get a lot of really nice features in here,

705
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:49,402
like soft shadows and really bring all the work

706
00:32:49,422 --> 00:32:52,262
that the character team did to bring the fidelity

707
00:32:52,282 --> 00:32:55,543
of those characters forward was showcased in these cinematics.

708
00:32:58,124 --> 00:32:59,664
And these are some of the production renders

709
00:32:59,684 --> 00:33:02,645
that we did for Tomb Raider across the two games.

710
00:33:03,646 --> 00:33:06,747
And each one has a similar theme.

711
00:33:07,263 --> 00:33:09,085
They all suggest survival.

712
00:33:10,025 --> 00:33:12,387
But once again, her attitudes,

713
00:33:12,628 --> 00:33:14,449
the reason I put these in across two games,

714
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:17,952
you're gonna see Lara's confidence change.

715
00:33:18,032 --> 00:33:19,994
So if you look at the early renderings,

716
00:33:20,134 --> 00:33:22,296
there's a lot more of her, the world,

717
00:33:22,716 --> 00:33:25,859
that is attacking her, and she's being attacked,

718
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:27,701
and sort of almost holding herself.

719
00:33:28,341 --> 00:33:30,603
And as she goes forward, she's now hunting the enemy.

720
00:33:31,484 --> 00:33:33,806
She's confidently striding forward.

721
00:33:34,818 --> 00:33:37,520
She's embracing the darkness.

722
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,801
She's going into the tomb.

723
00:33:38,841 --> 00:33:40,102
She's just not reacting to it.

724
00:33:40,542 --> 00:33:41,983
So all of these pieces of key art

725
00:33:42,523 --> 00:33:45,486
were helping us tell a story of her evolution as a character.

726
00:33:47,907 --> 00:33:49,969
Okay, this is the most important chapter

727
00:33:49,989 --> 00:33:51,790
and it's the one I have the least amount of slides on

728
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:53,071
because it's animation.

729
00:33:53,111 --> 00:33:54,912
It's not something I can look at and still pictures.

730
00:33:55,750 --> 00:34:00,358
But I can't say enough about how important animation is to your character.

731
00:34:00,739 --> 00:34:01,380
It's everything.

732
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:04,805
In fact, it's way more important than all the other stuff I just talked about.

733
00:34:06,689 --> 00:34:09,894
Breathing life into your character always comes from motion.

734
00:34:10,837 --> 00:34:12,577
and that can come from the actors you choose

735
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:15,218
to do motion capture or your key frame animators.

736
00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:17,799
But the reason I have this slide up here of these people

737
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,161
is because the animators are the ones that are the heroes.

738
00:34:21,281 --> 00:34:23,582
They're the heroes, they bring these heroes to life.

739
00:34:24,002 --> 00:34:26,383
Each one of these animators was Lara Croft

740
00:34:26,823 --> 00:34:28,023
because they worked on her every day

741
00:34:28,063 --> 00:34:29,984
and they brought the subtlety and nuance

742
00:34:30,785 --> 00:34:34,646
and emotion to what is essentially I call a puppet.

743
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:37,207
Because you can have the most beautiful puppet in the world

744
00:34:37,307 --> 00:34:40,008
and if it doesn't move right, you won't care about it.

745
00:34:40,769 --> 00:34:43,230
So the emotion of the game comes from these people right here.

746
00:34:45,132 --> 00:34:46,693
And I have a small movie.

747
00:34:46,993 --> 00:34:47,593
Well, you know what?

748
00:34:47,633 --> 00:34:48,714
I'm going to just skip the movie.

749
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:53,037
I just want to be able to give you guys some more time to ask

750
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:54,038
some questions if you have them.

751
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:55,619
I'm going to go through a bit of a summary.

752
00:34:58,541 --> 00:35:02,364
So the first thing you should think about is who your character is.

753
00:35:04,325 --> 00:35:07,367
Make a, come up with a theme that has a universal truth to it,

754
00:35:07,847 --> 00:35:08,988
shared by all cultures.

755
00:35:09,997 --> 00:35:13,018
Your hero should be driven by internal and external motivations.

756
00:35:14,539 --> 00:35:17,000
They should embark on a journey that forces them to change.

757
00:35:19,201 --> 00:35:21,362
And you should build a profile for your hero

758
00:35:21,742 --> 00:35:23,843
that is based on these themes and motivations.

759
00:35:24,243 --> 00:35:25,904
Something that you can always come back to and say,

760
00:35:25,924 --> 00:35:27,044
hey, would they do that?

761
00:35:27,665 --> 00:35:28,985
Does that make sense for this character?

762
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:32,910
And design a supporting cast of characters

763
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:35,651
that will complement or challenge your hero's goals.

764
00:35:36,492 --> 00:35:37,772
This is another important thing,

765
00:35:38,312 --> 00:35:40,713
and something that all of us are striving to get better at,

766
00:35:40,833 --> 00:35:44,895
is how can you make each supporting cast member

767
00:35:45,395 --> 00:35:48,156
as important and vital and well-rounded as your hero?

768
00:35:50,657 --> 00:35:52,217
And for the design, for the visual design,

769
00:35:52,797 --> 00:35:54,098
your hero should be iconic.

770
00:35:54,978 --> 00:35:55,979
Start with a silhouette.

771
00:35:56,499 --> 00:35:58,980
They should be recognizable without any internal detail.

772
00:35:59,883 --> 00:36:02,965
and design from the general, which is the broad silhouette,

773
00:36:03,305 --> 00:36:05,587
to the very specific, all the way down to that necklace.

774
00:36:06,087 --> 00:36:07,908
So you have to think about your characters,

775
00:36:07,928 --> 00:36:10,110
you're designing them through those different lenses.

776
00:36:11,891 --> 00:36:12,872
Try to cast an actor,

777
00:36:13,252 --> 00:36:14,673
even if you're not gonna work with an actor,

778
00:36:15,314 --> 00:36:18,896
imagine an actor that would give your character a soul,

779
00:36:19,817 --> 00:36:22,238
and then use that as inspiration

780
00:36:22,319 --> 00:36:24,200
for how they perform and how they work.

781
00:36:25,381 --> 00:36:27,522
And especially, in our case, how they would look.

782
00:36:30,477 --> 00:36:31,679
Wardrobe should be practical.

783
00:36:31,739 --> 00:36:32,581
This is my opinion.

784
00:36:32,661 --> 00:36:34,163
Some people don't believe in this.

785
00:36:34,303 --> 00:36:36,426
I just believe that the best heroes

786
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:37,889
have the most practical garments.

787
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:40,252
So think about clothes, not costumes.

788
00:36:41,156 --> 00:36:43,358
Think about even in the most stylized games,

789
00:36:43,538 --> 00:36:44,999
or like a character like Batman,

790
00:36:45,459 --> 00:36:48,641
every single thing on Batman's outfit serves a function.

791
00:36:49,282 --> 00:36:52,004
Even to the point of his silhouette, it invokes fear.

792
00:36:52,184 --> 00:36:54,806
So that is why he can look a little outrageous

793
00:36:54,906 --> 00:36:57,788
because he is trying to instill fear

794
00:36:57,908 --> 00:37:00,510
in an enemy that generally isn't afraid of anything.

795
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:03,552
And every detail tells a story.

796
00:37:03,892 --> 00:37:05,594
Every single thing you do to your character

797
00:37:05,694 --> 00:37:06,234
is going to tell...

798
00:37:07,352 --> 00:37:09,554
the viewer what they should think about that character.

799
00:37:10,074 --> 00:37:12,696
So make sure you appoint your hero with props

800
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,699
and reinforce those themes that you've talked about

801
00:37:15,819 --> 00:37:18,621
all the way at the profile into those details.

802
00:37:20,862 --> 00:37:21,883
And character execution.

803
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,525
If you're making a realistic character,

804
00:37:24,845 --> 00:37:26,707
try to cast some models that match your design.

805
00:37:28,088 --> 00:37:30,069
Purchase or create clothes for your model

806
00:37:30,109 --> 00:37:31,310
to achieve maximum realism.

807
00:37:31,491 --> 00:37:32,731
Once again, if you're going for realism.

808
00:37:34,744 --> 00:37:38,809
Photogrammetry is an amazing process to be able to capture all this detail.

809
00:37:39,089 --> 00:37:42,934
And where we're living in games now are really embracing physically correct environments.

810
00:37:42,974 --> 00:37:47,640
You can get all the great detail off of those, from that photogrammetry information

811
00:37:47,941 --> 00:37:50,484
that will help make your character more physically correct.

812
00:37:52,382 --> 00:37:54,643
You want to capture the faces and clothes

813
00:37:55,063 --> 00:37:56,444
with extreme poses in mind.

814
00:37:56,804 --> 00:37:58,345
So not only what they look like in the base,

815
00:37:58,365 --> 00:37:59,685
but what do they look like in motion?

816
00:38:00,186 --> 00:38:02,747
And then hopefully your artists can infuse

817
00:38:02,787 --> 00:38:05,368
some of that detail into the character when they move.

818
00:38:07,539 --> 00:38:09,840
And prepare your asset with dynamic distress.

819
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,301
Now once again, this is a style choice thing,

820
00:38:12,341 --> 00:38:14,342
but for every game I'll ever work on in the future,

821
00:38:14,362 --> 00:38:16,123
I'd love to see progression,

822
00:38:16,143 --> 00:38:18,564
and I'd love to see the character fit the world

823
00:38:18,604 --> 00:38:19,524
wherever they might be,

824
00:38:19,925 --> 00:38:23,786
whether they're covered in snow or ash or blood.

825
00:38:23,886 --> 00:38:25,567
Those things, if they're dynamic,

826
00:38:25,607 --> 00:38:26,848
they're that much more impactful.

827
00:38:28,892 --> 00:38:32,075
and connect the character to the world in action.

828
00:38:32,175 --> 00:38:34,557
So if you think about what your world is doing,

829
00:38:34,617 --> 00:38:36,419
your character should reflect those things

830
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:38,721
on the model itself.

831
00:38:41,283 --> 00:38:42,784
And performance, the most important thing

832
00:38:43,685 --> 00:38:45,587
is bring your character life with a motion style

833
00:38:45,627 --> 00:38:46,928
that reinforces your theme.

834
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,522
Performance capture is a great technology

835
00:38:51,122 --> 00:38:53,624
that you can capture even the most subtle performances

836
00:38:54,064 --> 00:38:57,587
from your actor and bring them and infuse them

837
00:38:57,627 --> 00:39:00,069
into your model with blend shapes and wrinkle maps.

838
00:39:00,089 --> 00:39:01,830
So this is getting a little bit more techie,

839
00:39:02,191 --> 00:39:03,952
but I absolutely love the new tech

840
00:39:03,972 --> 00:39:05,993
that we're able to embrace to bring subtlety

841
00:39:06,033 --> 00:39:06,734
to our characters.

842
00:39:08,215 --> 00:39:09,676
Think about contextual animations,

843
00:39:10,177 --> 00:39:12,919
things where your character and the world are related.

844
00:39:15,494 --> 00:39:17,435
One of the behaviors that we brought to Lara Croft

845
00:39:17,495 --> 00:39:19,798
is when she's cold, every time she goes near a fire,

846
00:39:19,818 --> 00:39:21,579
you'll see her rub her hands and warm her hands.

847
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,062
You'll see when she's also cold

848
00:39:25,103 --> 00:39:27,204
and not near a source like that, she'll shiver.

849
00:39:28,005 --> 00:39:29,527
When she's in a tight, claustrophobic space,

850
00:39:29,547 --> 00:39:30,788
she'll put her hand up on the wall

851
00:39:31,188 --> 00:39:33,070
to recognize it and to crouch down.

852
00:39:33,691 --> 00:39:35,552
So really think about those contextual animations

853
00:39:35,592 --> 00:39:36,773
that make your character connect

854
00:39:37,154 --> 00:39:37,955
to the world that they're in.

855
00:39:39,474 --> 00:39:40,855
And think about secondary animation.

856
00:39:41,496 --> 00:39:42,537
You know, the primary animation,

857
00:39:42,577 --> 00:39:44,258
the primary locomotion is fantastic,

858
00:39:44,278 --> 00:39:46,140
but it's those secondary animations

859
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,961
that really bring some life

860
00:39:48,262 --> 00:39:50,464
into what are essentially cycles.

861
00:39:51,885 --> 00:39:52,826
And if they're physics driven,

862
00:39:52,926 --> 00:39:55,588
you're going to see your cycles change

863
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:57,310
based on whatever wind or conditions

864
00:39:57,330 --> 00:39:58,771
that you might have in the world.

865
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:03,291
and reflect your character's growth through performance.

866
00:40:03,992 --> 00:40:05,173
As your story progresses,

867
00:40:05,914 --> 00:40:08,415
think about new behaviors or improvements to your character

868
00:40:08,736 --> 00:40:10,617
to continue to tell the story of their growth.

869
00:40:13,219 --> 00:40:13,619
All right.

870
00:40:15,521 --> 00:40:16,161
Questions?

871
00:40:17,983 --> 00:40:18,463
Comments?

872
00:40:19,004 --> 00:40:19,424
That's all I got.

873
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:32,182
If no one has questions, I'll play that video.

874
00:40:32,202 --> 00:40:36,388
All right, I'm gonna play that video.

875
00:40:37,794 --> 00:40:38,815
Okay, go ahead.

876
00:40:39,035 --> 00:40:40,776
So you knew you were making Lara Croft.

877
00:40:40,796 --> 00:40:45,239
Do you have recommendations for teams that are coming up with an original character,

878
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,902
especially if they're trying to make something that's original

879
00:40:48,922 --> 00:40:53,885
and not cookie cutter of all the other heroic game males?

880
00:40:54,946 --> 00:40:56,727
Ultimately, when you're making a hero,

881
00:40:58,448 --> 00:41:03,772
and you don't want to follow into the tropes and traps of classic archetypes,

882
00:41:04,699 --> 00:41:07,660
Just know that having a structure underneath you,

883
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,240
even if you're doing something abstract,

884
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,161
like your character's a blob of goo,

885
00:41:14,281 --> 00:41:16,441
as long as you're thinking about their character

886
00:41:16,461 --> 00:41:18,662
and how they change and how they interact

887
00:41:18,682 --> 00:41:19,522
with the world that they're in,

888
00:41:19,882 --> 00:41:21,242
you can really do some amazing things.

889
00:41:21,282 --> 00:41:24,443
But it's really understanding some of those core principles

890
00:41:24,903 --> 00:41:27,924
that can help you at least construct a framework

891
00:41:28,264 --> 00:41:29,424
to build any new character.

892
00:41:29,784 --> 00:41:32,124
So all I'd recommend is,

893
00:41:34,312 --> 00:41:36,054
Don't think of these constructs as rules

894
00:41:36,075 --> 00:41:36,776
that you have to follow.

895
00:41:36,816 --> 00:41:38,118
Just think of them as information

896
00:41:38,138 --> 00:41:39,480
that you can always come back to

897
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,464
if you're having a hard time finding

898
00:41:41,584 --> 00:41:44,969
what the center X or interest for your character might be.

899
00:41:47,943 --> 00:41:54,307
In some games you need to make a character that is completely out of the game itself, the environment,

900
00:41:54,487 --> 00:41:59,411
and it contrasts with the entire game and world.

901
00:41:59,431 --> 00:42:03,794
And at the same time, you need it to fit into what the game is aiming for.

902
00:42:04,295 --> 00:42:09,438
So, have you had any experience with that, including clothes, colors and animations?

903
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:14,194
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, sometimes you want your character to deliberately stand out.

904
00:42:14,875 --> 00:42:18,259
Some of my favorite games have a character who's in...

905
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:22,604
is made of silhouette, or like made of a shadow, and they're only visible...

906
00:42:22,825 --> 00:42:25,308
they're an invisible character, and they're only seen from their shadow.

907
00:42:25,948 --> 00:42:30,073
Or a character that's made of light, and they stand out in front of... in a dark world.

908
00:42:31,085 --> 00:42:33,667
So your character doesn't always have to blend in

909
00:42:33,828 --> 00:42:35,048
or be a part of that world,

910
00:42:35,068 --> 00:42:36,830
but they should have an effect on that world.

911
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:38,491
So whatever your character does,

912
00:42:39,192 --> 00:42:40,373
and whatever their goal might be,

913
00:42:40,413 --> 00:42:44,216
whether it's to be very unique and separate,

914
00:42:44,256 --> 00:42:45,477
even stylistically separate,

915
00:42:46,137 --> 00:42:49,580
just make sure that they're supporting a goal

916
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,201
that the game has, right?

917
00:42:51,321 --> 00:42:53,023
That that is ultimately what you're trying to do

918
00:42:53,063 --> 00:42:54,304
with your character at all times,

919
00:42:55,024 --> 00:42:57,846
is make it reflect the gameplay intentions

920
00:42:58,647 --> 00:42:59,628
that the game has itself.

921
00:43:04,829 --> 00:43:05,770
Hi.

922
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:10,333
Could you talk a little bit about the death animation in Tomb Raider?

923
00:43:10,593 --> 00:43:15,297
Because those are probably one of the best things that we remember about the game.

924
00:43:17,358 --> 00:43:19,359
Why do you need to make them so brutal?

925
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,302
So, it's a great question.

926
00:43:22,382 --> 00:43:23,082
We got that a lot.

927
00:43:24,823 --> 00:43:25,984
Yeah, so the question was,

928
00:43:27,785 --> 00:43:31,048
why did you make the death animation so brutal in Tomb Raider?

929
00:43:32,749 --> 00:43:34,170
And there's a good answer for that.

930
00:43:35,505 --> 00:43:40,087
One, we came back to what is the core theme of our game,

931
00:43:40,307 --> 00:43:41,127
and it was survival.

932
00:43:41,727 --> 00:43:45,668
And to us, you can't have actions without consequences.

933
00:43:46,228 --> 00:43:47,709
So if I'm on an interactive sequence,

934
00:43:47,749 --> 00:43:51,970
and my character's life depends on my actions,

935
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:54,930
and if I don't perform those actions correctly,

936
00:43:55,371 --> 00:43:56,911
there has to be a consequence that makes me go,

937
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:59,492
oh, I better not do that again, I better do that better.

938
00:43:59,912 --> 00:44:01,532
For some people, they're like, oh, I gotta see that again.

939
00:44:02,172 --> 00:44:03,733
You know, I mean, Conan O'Brien's,

940
00:44:04,807 --> 00:44:07,953
Clueless Gamer is sort of a meme, right?

941
00:44:07,973 --> 00:44:09,876
It's like, it became that thing where,

942
00:44:09,896 --> 00:44:12,441
because he was so bad at video games

943
00:44:12,481 --> 00:44:14,384
that he kept dying over and over and over again

944
00:44:14,404 --> 00:44:15,707
and it looked a little masochistic.

945
00:44:16,007 --> 00:44:16,809
But the hope is, is...

946
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:20,523
you don't die like that so often,

947
00:44:21,844 --> 00:44:25,367
and that they really are a source of feedback

948
00:44:25,728 --> 00:44:27,849
for the treacherous situations that you're in.

949
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:30,892
So as the character progressed,

950
00:44:30,952 --> 00:44:32,093
like in Rise of the Tomb Raider,

951
00:44:32,554 --> 00:44:33,915
we still had our brutal deaths,

952
00:44:33,955 --> 00:44:36,497
but there weren't as many, and they weren't as frequent,

953
00:44:36,958 --> 00:44:38,839
and that wasn't because we were trying to be more PC.

954
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:41,181
We were really trying to say that the character's grown,

955
00:44:41,722 --> 00:44:43,784
and that her competence has improved.

956
00:44:44,484 --> 00:44:48,907
And that is why the tone shifted across the games.

957
00:44:49,607 --> 00:44:49,967
Thank you.

958
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:50,568
Yeah.

959
00:44:51,728 --> 00:44:53,189
Hey Brian, great talk.

960
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:57,672
So my question was, how much of the story in Tomb Raider

961
00:44:57,752 --> 00:45:00,793
was known up front relative to the design of the character

962
00:45:00,853 --> 00:45:02,694
and how much did changes to the story,

963
00:45:02,714 --> 00:45:05,316
that iteration process affect either Lara

964
00:45:05,376 --> 00:45:07,457
or any of the other supporting characters in Tomb Raider

965
00:45:07,537 --> 00:45:08,518
or Rise of the Tomb Raider?

966
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:11,672
Yeah, so the question was how much of the story

967
00:45:11,712 --> 00:45:13,573
was written before we started the character

968
00:45:13,633 --> 00:45:17,016
and how much of the character came first

969
00:45:17,076 --> 00:45:17,997
and the story came later?

970
00:45:18,437 --> 00:45:22,200
And I can tell you that the goals were right away.

971
00:45:22,741 --> 00:45:24,082
Like when we were designing the character,

972
00:45:24,142 --> 00:45:28,005
all those ideas and archetypes and survival themes,

973
00:45:28,585 --> 00:45:29,266
that was first.

974
00:45:29,806 --> 00:45:31,307
So we really couldn't design the character

975
00:45:31,327 --> 00:45:32,068
without having that.

976
00:45:32,168 --> 00:45:34,630
Now, when it came to that story that I went through,

977
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:36,631
that whole loop of how Lara went through

978
00:45:36,651 --> 00:45:38,213
the hero's journey, that came much later.

979
00:45:38,873 --> 00:45:44,316
But, if you have that story ahead of time, it's even more powerful for your artists because

980
00:45:44,716 --> 00:45:50,379
they can imbue the character with key ingredients throughout that story that are going to make

981
00:45:50,419 --> 00:45:51,379
them that much more rich.

982
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:57,562
So the aspiration is, if you can, get your writers and your game designers together early

983
00:45:57,622 --> 00:46:01,224
enough to talk about the arc and to talk about where your character is going to go.

984
00:46:01,764 --> 00:46:04,705
that's going to inform the character artists that design them.

985
00:46:05,065 --> 00:46:05,825
So that would be the hope.

986
00:46:06,205 --> 00:46:08,466
But ultimately what we had was the character first,

987
00:46:08,926 --> 00:46:10,766
and then as new events happened to her,

988
00:46:11,146 --> 00:46:13,487
we started to add ingredients to her character.

989
00:46:13,547 --> 00:46:16,307
So there was a scene when she got impaled by...

990
00:46:17,628 --> 00:46:20,128
When she fell down, she got impaled by a piece of rebar.

991
00:46:20,508 --> 00:46:23,889
And then we added that as a permanent part of a scar in her character.

992
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:27,632
or when she was hit in the face with Vlad by a gun,

993
00:46:27,712 --> 00:46:29,293
we brought into Rise of the Tomb Raider

994
00:46:29,334 --> 00:46:31,235
that little scar went into the next game.

995
00:46:31,776 --> 00:46:34,738
So we tried to build and accumulate these experiences

996
00:46:34,798 --> 00:46:38,301
on the character and see as her wardrobe

997
00:46:38,341 --> 00:46:41,043
or her costume would reflect all the trauma,

998
00:46:41,564 --> 00:46:43,365
that that was just, those were things

999
00:46:43,385 --> 00:46:44,866
that we brought into the character

1000
00:46:45,067 --> 00:46:46,708
as the story was being written.

1001
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:49,871
Yeah?

1002
00:46:50,011 --> 00:46:51,892
Hi, I have a question about like...

1003
00:46:52,945 --> 00:46:57,511
You talked about building the characters in the third person perspective,

1004
00:46:57,611 --> 00:47:00,695
but when you develop first person shooter,

1005
00:47:01,436 --> 00:47:04,560
I think most people project themselves to the characters.

1006
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:09,166
So is there some different approach to develop and making characters?

1007
00:47:10,053 --> 00:47:11,996
Yeah, I think there's two different approaches.

1008
00:47:12,056 --> 00:47:15,641
Like for Infinite Warfare, we decided to make Reyes

1009
00:47:16,362 --> 00:47:18,285
a real character that had a voice

1010
00:47:18,425 --> 00:47:20,508
and that we would see him in cinematics and cut scenes.

1011
00:47:20,828 --> 00:47:23,392
So we were playing a character just like a third person

1012
00:47:23,913 --> 00:47:24,734
action adventure game.

1013
00:47:25,094 --> 00:47:26,136
But there are games like Half-Life.

1014
00:47:27,188 --> 00:47:31,493
Half-Life 2, one of my favorite games, where the character is a cypher, right?

1015
00:47:31,513 --> 00:47:36,098
They don't have a personality because you want to transport your personality into them.

1016
00:47:36,679 --> 00:47:37,680
Now that's really cool.

1017
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:42,586
I think there's something really important about that, but if you want to have your character

1018
00:47:42,626 --> 00:47:43,007
go on an arc...

1019
00:47:44,367 --> 00:47:48,970
it's all then about the reflection of that art has to come from your support cast and from the world itself.

1020
00:47:49,471 --> 00:47:54,314
So the lift is now on the environment artists, the lift is on the supporting cast

1021
00:47:54,675 --> 00:47:57,197
to help reflect back what my actions did.

1022
00:47:57,917 --> 00:48:00,519
So this is a constant battle we have as game developers is

1023
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:04,823
when we want to tell a story which has a prescribed beginning and end,

1024
00:48:06,264 --> 00:48:10,145
And that conflicts with a goal that a player might have.

1025
00:48:10,685 --> 00:48:12,386
You have what we call cognitive dissonance,

1026
00:48:12,426 --> 00:48:13,806
and it's something that we dealt with a lot.

1027
00:48:13,826 --> 00:48:15,267
Like, hey, I wouldn't have felt that way

1028
00:48:15,687 --> 00:48:16,787
if I shot that person.

1029
00:48:16,807 --> 00:48:19,188
I would have felt happy about it, not sad about it.

1030
00:48:19,888 --> 00:48:22,929
So one of our challenges as game developers

1031
00:48:23,109 --> 00:48:25,790
is how do we ensure that we have parity

1032
00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:28,210
with what the character's feeling

1033
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:30,211
and what the audience member might be feeling?

1034
00:48:31,186 --> 00:48:34,247
And that's why first-person shooters that let you be a cypher,

1035
00:48:34,287 --> 00:48:37,268
or let that first-person character not have a personality,

1036
00:48:37,688 --> 00:48:40,349
that's probably the cleanest and easiest way to do that.

1037
00:48:40,809 --> 00:48:44,110
But I challenge all of us to think about telling stories completely,

1038
00:48:44,310 --> 00:48:47,651
all the way through, and retaining that connection with the character

1039
00:48:47,991 --> 00:48:49,031
and the way the player feels.

1040
00:48:49,991 --> 00:48:53,792
And I know it's something that I've got friends over here from Naughty Dog,

1041
00:48:53,832 --> 00:48:55,513
it's something I'm sure you guys talk about a lot.

1042
00:48:56,233 --> 00:48:57,814
And I worked with Taylor and Jacob,

1043
00:48:58,355 --> 00:48:59,876
and they worked on The Last of Us,

1044
00:48:59,896 --> 00:49:01,617
and it's one of my favorite games of all time.

1045
00:49:02,098 --> 00:49:03,038
And I remember telling him,

1046
00:49:03,058 --> 00:49:05,240
hey, my only beef with that game was at the end,

1047
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:08,543
I wouldn't have made the same decisions Joel made.

1048
00:49:09,183 --> 00:49:10,845
But what they told me was really compelling.

1049
00:49:10,945 --> 00:49:12,606
They said, well, that wasn't your story.

1050
00:49:12,987 --> 00:49:14,047
That was Joel's story.

1051
00:49:14,668 --> 00:49:16,710
And as long as you're with him along the line,

1052
00:49:17,170 --> 00:49:19,412
you'll understand and appreciate that decision

1053
00:49:19,552 --> 00:49:20,813
that he made for himself.

1054
00:49:21,413 --> 00:49:22,895
So those are the kind of challenges we have

1055
00:49:23,115 --> 00:49:24,956
as designers and as artists,

1056
00:49:25,437 --> 00:49:28,860
is to try our best to tell compelling emotional stories,

1057
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,683
yet embrace the agency that is in video games.

1058
00:49:33,744 --> 00:49:34,044
Thank you.

1059
00:49:34,624 --> 00:49:34,884
Thank you.

1060
00:49:35,765 --> 00:49:36,586
Hi. Hi.

1061
00:49:36,846 --> 00:49:40,089
Could you talk more about designing female protagonists?

1062
00:49:40,309 --> 00:49:41,590
Like, what are the challenges

1063
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:43,351
and what are the things you have to keep in mind?

1064
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:47,842
Yeah, when it comes to female protagonists, I don't think that's important.

1065
00:49:49,483 --> 00:49:51,303
I'm going to say that one more time, it's not important.

1066
00:49:52,084 --> 00:49:53,124
The hero is the hero.

1067
00:49:54,084 --> 00:49:57,806
Now, am I saying is there a difference between a man and a woman?

1068
00:49:57,906 --> 00:49:58,486
Absolutely.

1069
00:49:58,947 --> 00:50:02,228
But you just build that into part of who they are as a character.

1070
00:50:04,743 --> 00:50:07,724
The only reason I can say that there's a problem with it right now is because people still

1071
00:50:07,824 --> 00:50:09,965
obsess about it as a thing, right?

1072
00:50:10,185 --> 00:50:15,066
Being a female, oh my gosh, I'm a dude and I feel really uncomfortable playing as a female

1073
00:50:15,086 --> 00:50:16,366
and I don't know how that makes me feel.

1074
00:50:16,926 --> 00:50:19,307
That can exist and some people have issues with that.

1075
00:50:19,687 --> 00:50:23,388
But really what we're trying to get to is a place is that your character is your character.

1076
00:50:23,948 --> 00:50:28,589
They can be female and they can be an alien, they can be a man, they can be a piece of

1077
00:50:28,669 --> 00:50:30,389
slime, they can be whatever you want.

1078
00:50:30,989 --> 00:50:34,330
But ultimately, does their motivations ring true?

1079
00:50:35,491 --> 00:50:38,411
Does the characters actions reflect their motivations?

1080
00:50:40,372 --> 00:50:41,192
Are they compelling?

1081
00:50:41,472 --> 00:50:42,293
Are they interesting?

1082
00:50:42,553 --> 00:50:44,093
Do they have some place to go?

1083
00:50:44,113 --> 00:50:46,374
And as long as you have all of those things

1084
00:50:46,434 --> 00:50:49,255
and you could take, the reason that this presentation

1085
00:50:49,295 --> 00:50:52,676
was so much more about the structure of your hero

1086
00:50:52,736 --> 00:50:55,117
and not so much about the choices you make

1087
00:50:55,697 --> 00:50:57,177
is because once you have that right,

1088
00:50:58,018 --> 00:50:59,878
you can really design pretty much anything

1089
00:51:00,538 --> 00:51:02,459
and your audience is gonna be along the ride with you.

1090
00:51:02,479 --> 00:51:03,599
At least that's my belief.

1091
00:51:07,625 --> 00:51:08,788
All right, that's all I got.

1092
00:51:08,988 --> 00:51:09,990
Thank you guys so much for coming.

1093
00:51:10,211 --> 00:51:10,632
Appreciate it.
