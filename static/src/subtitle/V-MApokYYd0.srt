1
00:00:06,913 --> 00:00:19,943
Hello? Hello? Alright. Alright let's get this talk started. Thank you. Okay please

2
00:00:20,283 --> 00:00:27,588
silence your devices. So hello and welcome to this talk. Thanks for coming. Really

3
00:00:27,608 --> 00:00:34,313
appreciate it. My name is Adam Miller and the talk today is titled the mechanics of

4
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:35,353
explosive growth.

5
00:00:37,028 --> 00:00:40,309
So I am a VP of Engineering at Roblox.

6
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,031
And for those of you who are not aware of Roblox,

7
00:00:44,331 --> 00:00:47,773
we're the largest entertainment platform for kids under 18.

8
00:00:49,994 --> 00:00:52,135
And I've been at Roblox for five and a half years.

9
00:00:52,995 --> 00:00:55,336
And while I've been there, I've been fortunate enough

10
00:00:55,496 --> 00:00:59,738
to witness really interesting trajectory of growth.

11
00:01:00,919 --> 00:01:04,140
So I'm gonna tell you a little bit of that story today.

12
00:01:16,066 --> 00:01:17,247
Oh, I got to turn the clicker on.

13
00:01:17,427 --> 00:01:18,347
That would be a good step.

14
00:01:23,631 --> 00:01:24,932
All right, anyway.

15
00:01:25,692 --> 00:01:29,575
So this one slide kind of captures

16
00:01:29,615 --> 00:01:31,376
the essence of this whole talk.

17
00:01:32,457 --> 00:01:35,919
So this is the story of many, many years

18
00:01:36,539 --> 00:01:39,341
of moderate and steady growth.

19
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:42,975
And then all of a sudden in the beginning of 2016,

20
00:01:43,015 --> 00:01:46,156
boom, hockey stick.

21
00:01:46,697 --> 00:01:50,399
We hit the inflection point and things really take off.

22
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:55,241
So today I'm gonna give you a little bit of background

23
00:01:55,361 --> 00:01:57,242
on how we got to this point,

24
00:01:59,523 --> 00:02:01,684
how we experienced it while it was happening,

25
00:02:02,925 --> 00:02:04,266
how we analyzed it,

26
00:02:05,106 --> 00:02:08,448
and some of the conclusions that we came up with.

27
00:02:09,577 --> 00:02:13,401
So I am not an expert on growth theory,

28
00:02:13,581 --> 00:02:15,002
on company growth in general.

29
00:02:15,463 --> 00:02:18,686
This is one data point that I think is interesting

30
00:02:18,726 --> 00:02:20,448
and hopefully has some takeaways.

31
00:02:24,953 --> 00:02:28,116
So a little bit of background on how we started.

32
00:02:29,237 --> 00:02:30,699
Roblox first launched in 2006.

33
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:36,970
And we began with a fundamental premise about people,

34
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:43,192
which is that humans want a place for self-directed,

35
00:02:44,293 --> 00:02:45,373
imaginative play.

36
00:02:46,373 --> 00:02:48,114
And increasingly in this world, it's

37
00:02:48,394 --> 00:02:50,915
harder and harder to find that, especially

38
00:02:50,995 --> 00:02:53,415
for teenagers and kids.

39
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:56,957
So when Roblox started, we wanted

40
00:02:56,997 --> 00:03:02,318
to try to give a place that allows that online.

41
00:03:03,422 --> 00:03:09,387
And it started out as a physics educational tool or toy.

42
00:03:10,368 --> 00:03:12,631
But quickly we added some basic functionality

43
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:14,793
that defined our platform.

44
00:03:16,194 --> 00:03:17,816
So giving every character,

45
00:03:17,896 --> 00:03:20,158
every person who plays on Roblox an avatar,

46
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:24,502
that's the 3D representation of yourself in the game.

47
00:03:25,844 --> 00:03:27,385
We added Lua scripting.

48
00:03:29,187 --> 00:03:31,730
From being just physics, adding scripting,

49
00:03:32,491 --> 00:03:36,537
we enabled more compelling experiences

50
00:03:36,617 --> 00:03:38,380
and games to be created on the platform.

51
00:03:40,263 --> 00:03:45,751
And finally, we added the ability for our community

52
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:49,661
to create content as well as just creating in-house.

53
00:03:50,162 --> 00:03:52,325
We thought first we could create the content,

54
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,248
but by bringing these tools and releasing them

55
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,651
to an existing passionate user base,

56
00:03:58,452 --> 00:04:01,296
we found that they could create content better than us,

57
00:04:01,476 --> 00:04:02,738
not just in terms of quantity,

58
00:04:02,798 --> 00:04:04,660
but even in terms of the quality.

59
00:04:06,571 --> 00:04:08,432
And in the end, we have this system

60
00:04:08,492 --> 00:04:11,393
where there's all these games, these rich experiences,

61
00:04:12,033 --> 00:04:13,313
they stream from the cloud,

62
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:14,954
people play them with their friends,

63
00:04:15,754 --> 00:04:19,295
and kids can jump from one to the next and have a good time.

64
00:04:22,216 --> 00:04:25,438
So this video is a little bit of an overview

65
00:04:25,478 --> 00:04:28,399
of what Roblox looks like many years later.

66
00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:32,660
You can see it's 3D, it's avatar-based,

67
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,701
although the avatars can be kind of funky and fresh.

68
00:04:35,933 --> 00:04:39,335
you still see a lot of social activity.

69
00:04:39,635 --> 00:04:40,896
People are talking to each other,

70
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:44,358
running around doing things like working in a pizza place,

71
00:04:45,058 --> 00:04:49,080
exploring worlds, chatting, driving cool vehicles,

72
00:04:50,761 --> 00:04:53,303
playing in platformer type situations,

73
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:56,504
or even being a bird, flying through a forest,

74
00:04:57,165 --> 00:04:59,406
scavenging for grubs, things like that.

75
00:05:06,281 --> 00:05:09,785
So there's a phase that I'm calling

76
00:05:09,825 --> 00:05:11,407
the formative years of Roblox.

77
00:05:12,508 --> 00:05:14,090
And this is the long period of time

78
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:17,634
where we focused on building our core vision.

79
00:05:18,635 --> 00:05:20,977
This is the 10 years from that launch in 2006

80
00:05:21,258 --> 00:05:24,721
until that really big growth thing

81
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,083
we're gonna talk about in 2016.

82
00:05:29,694 --> 00:05:32,157
So in this time, we focused on trying to solve

83
00:05:32,197 --> 00:05:33,378
these really hard problems.

84
00:05:34,219 --> 00:05:36,862
And to do that, you build an amazing team.

85
00:05:36,902 --> 00:05:39,345
You build a team that focuses and thinks

86
00:05:39,425 --> 00:05:41,587
about these really hard, long-term problems.

87
00:05:42,248 --> 00:05:43,970
And some of the things we've built in this time

88
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,360
We're enabling easy play with friends,

89
00:05:48,141 --> 00:05:50,382
really doubling down on that social experience.

90
00:05:51,102 --> 00:05:53,403
So kids can be together, they can be on different devices,

91
00:05:53,684 --> 00:05:55,765
they're in one same virtual world,

92
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:57,846
they're jumping around, talking to each other,

93
00:05:57,866 --> 00:06:00,487
having another experience in another game,

94
00:06:01,288 --> 00:06:03,829
making that seamless so it goes across PC, Mac,

95
00:06:03,929 --> 00:06:05,870
iOS, Android, Xbox, VR,

96
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,171
and you can all be playing together in one world.

97
00:06:08,552 --> 00:06:10,372
That's not so easy, not a lot of people do that,

98
00:06:11,093 --> 00:06:13,154
but we focused on that as one of our big things.

99
00:06:15,258 --> 00:06:23,540
and enabling these tools that work in a way that creators can create a piece of content

100
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:29,782
and quickly push it to the cloud, have lots of people playing, and it just works automatically.

101
00:06:30,862 --> 00:06:32,122
We scale to lots of people.

102
00:06:33,283 --> 00:06:39,804
So in this time, we're experiencing a growth that's in the 30 to 50% year-over-year range.

103
00:06:40,884 --> 00:06:43,905
And it's steady, and there's challenges that came along.

104
00:06:45,182 --> 00:06:50,386
challenges for our own toughness. So competitors would launch, potential competitors. Sometimes

105
00:06:50,426 --> 00:06:54,669
these games would launch and they would just explode. They would take off. They're getting

106
00:06:54,729 --> 00:06:55,369
10,000% week over week.

107
00:06:58,268 --> 00:07:00,949
The challenge for us, the big thing we thought about was,

108
00:07:01,349 --> 00:07:02,270
do we try and copy them?

109
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,151
Wow, they're having all this success over here.

110
00:07:04,251 --> 00:07:06,432
Should we do some of the things they're doing,

111
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,453
or do we stay to our true vision?

112
00:07:09,013 --> 00:07:10,814
And I would say this is the period of time

113
00:07:10,834 --> 00:07:13,575
when we really focused on our vision

114
00:07:14,436 --> 00:07:15,977
and kept that same course.

115
00:07:19,578 --> 00:07:19,799
So 2016.

116
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,980
And to step back a little bit.

117
00:07:28,103 --> 00:07:31,824
The beginning of 2015, we set a company goal.

118
00:07:33,064 --> 00:07:35,745
We said, we're gonna grow at 85% this year.

119
00:07:36,445 --> 00:07:38,585
And it was crazy, it was outlandish.

120
00:07:38,986 --> 00:07:41,486
We'd grown at like 35% the year before.

121
00:07:42,466 --> 00:07:43,827
We're like, no, we're gonna grow at 85,

122
00:07:43,867 --> 00:07:46,107
we're gonna set this really high bar.

123
00:07:46,207 --> 00:07:48,808
So everyone's like, okay, I don't know if we can do it,

124
00:07:48,888 --> 00:07:50,008
but we're gonna try.

125
00:07:51,731 --> 00:07:53,813
So the 2015 holiday comes around,

126
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:56,395
and it's the best holiday season ever.

127
00:07:57,016 --> 00:08:01,079
We're taking off, there's tons of traffic,

128
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:03,161
but we always do well during the holidays,

129
00:08:03,221 --> 00:08:04,863
so it's not that big a surprise.

130
00:08:04,883 --> 00:08:06,184
It's like, okay, things are good.

131
00:08:07,845 --> 00:08:11,649
But then January comes around, and things are even better.

132
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:13,210
Instead of dipping down again,

133
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:14,732
we're just continuing to grow,

134
00:08:14,792 --> 00:08:17,094
so this is crazy, like, what's going on?

135
00:08:17,674 --> 00:08:21,136
People are looking around, maybe it's a stat collection problem,

136
00:08:21,156 --> 00:08:24,278
no, things seem okay, maybe it's a botting problem.

137
00:08:24,578 --> 00:08:25,899
Got all these bots attacking us.

138
00:08:26,859 --> 00:08:29,101
But no, they're paying us money.

139
00:08:29,201 --> 00:08:30,782
Bots don't normally like to pay you money.

140
00:08:31,002 --> 00:08:33,083
It's probably not that.

141
00:08:33,743 --> 00:08:36,205
So all of a sudden we realize that this is real.

142
00:08:37,065 --> 00:08:37,426
We're hitting 300%.

143
00:08:37,546 --> 00:08:40,788
All of a sudden it's just going crazy.

144
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:42,531
So, very exciting.

145
00:08:44,933 --> 00:08:46,594
And we wanna figure out why.

146
00:08:47,354 --> 00:08:49,676
Because if it's one thing we just started doing,

147
00:08:49,716 --> 00:08:52,157
well, we better make sure we don't undo that.

148
00:08:53,558 --> 00:08:54,299
And we weren't quite sure.

149
00:08:58,475 --> 00:09:00,415
We started to think about it, but at the time,

150
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,896
so much of our effort was just keeping things running, right?

151
00:09:03,996 --> 00:09:06,057
We got this amazing growth,

152
00:09:06,397 --> 00:09:08,397
and we wanna make sure the servers stay up,

153
00:09:08,437 --> 00:09:09,418
and the site doesn't come down,

154
00:09:09,438 --> 00:09:11,418
and the database doesn't collapse under the load,

155
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:12,959
and we just ride this train.

156
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:15,599
So, people talked about theories,

157
00:09:15,719 --> 00:09:20,160
but there wasn't even time to figure it out at the time.

158
00:09:20,221 --> 00:09:23,441
So we said, okay, cool, we know something's going well,

159
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:26,262
let's ride it for now, and see what happens.

160
00:09:27,554 --> 00:09:31,696
So we had a bunch of theories at the time.

161
00:09:31,896 --> 00:09:35,858
When I researched for this talk, I got a bunch more theories.

162
00:09:36,178 --> 00:09:39,100
There's as many theories as there are people

163
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,301
that you can talk to about it.

164
00:09:43,219 --> 00:09:45,461
And a lot of them are very interesting.

165
00:09:45,521 --> 00:09:47,983
So I'd go to the marketing team and I'd be like,

166
00:09:48,324 --> 00:09:51,306
hey guys, why did we grow like this two years ago?

167
00:09:51,326 --> 00:09:52,708
They're like, oh, it's very simple.

168
00:09:54,289 --> 00:09:56,732
Yeah, we did these awesome co-brandings.

169
00:09:57,052 --> 00:09:58,593
We really got our brand out there

170
00:09:59,074 --> 00:10:00,375
and we got our name out there.

171
00:10:00,395 --> 00:10:01,496
It just like took off.

172
00:10:01,516 --> 00:10:03,018
I was like, ah, cool, good story.

173
00:10:03,038 --> 00:10:05,740
And then I'd go to the web engineers and be like, hey.

174
00:10:06,762 --> 00:10:08,003
Why do you think we started, Ryan?

175
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:11,286
Oh yeah, it's because we fixed the polish on the site.

176
00:10:11,326 --> 00:10:12,987
Like, the site used to be so ugly.

177
00:10:13,448 --> 00:10:14,589
Now it looks professional.

178
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:17,211
Like, we took Comic Sans out of the website.

179
00:10:18,032 --> 00:10:20,775
Take Comic Sans out, I mean, there's just no limit

180
00:10:20,795 --> 00:10:22,917
to how much you can grow.

181
00:10:24,859 --> 00:10:26,220
It makes sense, right?

182
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,882
So, you think I'm joking, I'm not joking.

183
00:10:31,102 --> 00:10:34,665
So, and I go to like the product team,

184
00:10:34,685 --> 00:10:36,467
and they're like, why do you think we're going?

185
00:10:36,627 --> 00:10:39,190
Oh, it's very, there's a great reason for it.

186
00:10:40,091 --> 00:10:42,833
We finally enabled excellent party play,

187
00:10:43,154 --> 00:10:45,296
like the ability for people to jump in game together.

188
00:10:45,336 --> 00:10:46,417
We fixed all those problems,

189
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,319
we really unlocked that social dynamic.

190
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:50,839
That sounds interesting.

191
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:52,719
So there's all these theories going on.

192
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,340
Everyone's got a different one.

193
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,341
Let's dive into a couple of what I think

194
00:10:58,381 --> 00:11:00,562
are some of the most compelling ones

195
00:11:01,582 --> 00:11:05,063
and take a look at how that plays out.

196
00:11:06,103 --> 00:11:09,364
So theory number one, YouTube influencers.

197
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:14,872
These are the YouTubers who are either new to Roblox

198
00:11:15,212 --> 00:11:18,733
or started streaming Roblox around the beginning of 2016.

199
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:22,554
Right around the time when we're growing,

200
00:11:23,674 --> 00:11:25,995
all of a sudden there's tons of YouTube videos going up.

201
00:11:26,935 --> 00:11:28,516
And some of them are getting millions of views,

202
00:11:28,576 --> 00:11:29,736
tens of millions of views.

203
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:31,837
Clearly they're driving traffic to our site.

204
00:11:31,877 --> 00:11:33,337
So this could be it.

205
00:11:33,457 --> 00:11:38,118
Like maybe we hit some kind of big thing on YouTube

206
00:11:38,338 --> 00:11:40,279
and that just took over and drove all the traffic.

207
00:11:42,193 --> 00:11:45,875
So looking back at the charting of it,

208
00:11:47,717 --> 00:11:48,817
I'm plotting two things here.

209
00:11:48,957 --> 00:11:54,661
So I'm plotting the Roblox activity on YouTube

210
00:11:55,602 --> 00:11:57,763
versus the Roblox signups.

211
00:11:59,624 --> 00:12:03,667
And when we see this, the YouTube activity

212
00:12:04,828 --> 00:12:06,389
turns out is a trailing indicator.

213
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:09,791
So it's actually growing a little bit after.

214
00:12:10,816 --> 00:12:12,718
the Roblox signup indicator.

215
00:12:13,478 --> 00:12:15,120
And so, what that means is,

216
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:18,422
it's actually the new Roblox users who are saying,

217
00:12:18,602 --> 00:12:20,744
oh, I wanna also go to YouTube

218
00:12:20,884 --> 00:12:22,245
and watch videos about Roblox.

219
00:12:22,886 --> 00:12:24,507
So that makes sense, right.

220
00:12:24,948 --> 00:12:26,869
And it's still a great thing for the company,

221
00:12:26,909 --> 00:12:30,292
we appreciate it, but it can't be the one factor

222
00:12:30,312 --> 00:12:34,255
that explains our growth trajectory.

223
00:12:35,857 --> 00:12:37,678
So, theory number two.

224
00:12:39,663 --> 00:12:41,504
We've always had some international presence.

225
00:12:42,785 --> 00:12:44,126
Back around this time, 2015, 2016,

226
00:12:44,887 --> 00:12:49,610
we made a big effort to put servers

227
00:12:50,251 --> 00:12:51,552
in different countries around the world

228
00:12:51,832 --> 00:12:52,973
where we had a lot of players.

229
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:56,195
And the theory was our games are all networked

230
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:59,217
and if you're connecting to a server,

231
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:00,078
you have a lower latency,

232
00:13:00,098 --> 00:13:01,439
you're gonna have a better experience,

233
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,841
you're gonna wanna play Roblox more.

234
00:13:03,861 --> 00:13:06,863
And this graph shows what happened

235
00:13:07,744 --> 00:13:09,025
when we launched.

236
00:13:09,724 --> 00:13:13,948
our servers in Germany, all of a sudden in Turkey,

237
00:13:14,008 --> 00:13:16,010
which is pretty nearby, you can just see this

238
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,372
jump in activity.

239
00:13:18,392 --> 00:13:20,714
It seems very clearly correlated.

240
00:13:21,395 --> 00:13:23,637
I think the internet isn't so good in Turkey.

241
00:13:24,978 --> 00:13:28,241
So, this seems like a pretty compelling explanation

242
00:13:28,261 --> 00:13:29,843
when you see a jump like this.

243
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:31,224
But,

244
00:13:32,137 --> 00:13:35,058
Then you start to look at what happened in Germany itself.

245
00:13:36,019 --> 00:13:38,720
So Germany itself, even though they got the actual servers,

246
00:13:39,321 --> 00:13:40,021
there's no change.

247
00:13:41,802 --> 00:13:44,303
And it's not 100% clear why,

248
00:13:44,363 --> 00:13:46,805
but we think it's because their internet

249
00:13:46,865 --> 00:13:48,165
was already pretty good.

250
00:13:48,906 --> 00:13:52,548
So they had some kind of connection to somewhere else

251
00:13:52,628 --> 00:13:53,568
that was already good enough,

252
00:13:54,329 --> 00:13:56,610
whereas the Turks really had that jump in experience.

253
00:13:58,287 --> 00:13:59,828
And when we looked across the world

254
00:13:59,868 --> 00:14:01,769
at all the different places where we added servers

255
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,871
in all these countries, there were some pockets

256
00:14:04,151 --> 00:14:05,232
where there was some change.

257
00:14:05,733 --> 00:14:08,315
But it wasn't enough to really explain

258
00:14:08,675 --> 00:14:10,296
the whole change in our growth.

259
00:14:10,957 --> 00:14:13,759
So another good thing, but not the answer.

260
00:14:17,042 --> 00:14:20,044
Very compelling theory, our Xbox launch.

261
00:14:21,866 --> 00:14:24,728
So we first launched an Xbox at the beginning of 2016.

262
00:14:24,768 --> 00:14:25,309
Right in January.

263
00:14:28,653 --> 00:14:32,696
and it's that little white bump that starts appearing at the top of the graph.

264
00:14:33,557 --> 00:14:35,058
So it's a lot of new users coming in.

265
00:14:36,599 --> 00:14:41,283
And there's a theory that beyond just these new users you're getting,

266
00:14:42,183 --> 00:14:45,225
there's additional benefit for the existing users.

267
00:14:45,966 --> 00:14:48,908
So if you have one house and two siblings want to play,

268
00:14:49,509 --> 00:14:51,510
and all they have is an iPad and an Xbox,

269
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,912
all of a sudden, if the Xbox can play too,

270
00:14:54,392 --> 00:14:56,414
you've got more benefit because they can play together.

271
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:58,751
So you take these two things together,

272
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:00,131
it's a very strong theory.

273
00:15:02,631 --> 00:15:06,152
So we have to dive a little bit into

274
00:15:07,272 --> 00:15:10,653
how growth works to analyze this theory.

275
00:15:11,293 --> 00:15:13,934
So for growth, there's really only two things you can move.

276
00:15:14,774 --> 00:15:16,914
You can either get more new users

277
00:15:16,954 --> 00:15:17,974
at the beginning of the funnel,

278
00:15:19,095 --> 00:15:21,775
or you can lose fewer users at the end of the funnel.

279
00:15:23,275 --> 00:15:25,976
And looking at this growth in this particular time,

280
00:15:27,336 --> 00:15:29,417
we realized that it was new users

281
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:31,658
at the beginning of the funnel that was changing.

282
00:15:32,138 --> 00:15:34,460
The retention metrics didn't particularly move.

283
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,901
So okay, that sounds good.

284
00:15:36,941 --> 00:15:39,742
That seems to match what we see with Xbox.

285
00:15:39,782 --> 00:15:41,163
We see new users with Xbox.

286
00:15:42,424 --> 00:15:43,124
But here's the problem.

287
00:15:44,205 --> 00:15:47,026
So this is a graph of overall traffic.

288
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:51,148
But we're seeing a change in new user acquisition.

289
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:52,989
Now new user acquisition,

290
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:55,826
is a leading indicator for traffic,

291
00:15:56,807 --> 00:15:59,227
meaning the users that were acquired

292
00:15:59,347 --> 00:16:01,108
and the change in rate at which they were acquired

293
00:16:01,508 --> 00:16:03,648
happened earlier than this growth.

294
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,229
So when we look back at when it really changed,

295
00:16:06,349 --> 00:16:09,530
it was actually August and September the year before

296
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,731
where we started to see this uptick

297
00:16:12,311 --> 00:16:13,411
in new user acquisition.

298
00:16:14,171 --> 00:16:17,632
So that unfortunately invalidates Xbox, that's the theory.

299
00:16:21,163 --> 00:16:25,665
So this is where things get a little bit more murky,

300
00:16:26,626 --> 00:16:27,667
but super important.

301
00:16:29,908 --> 00:16:31,529
There was a really fundamental change

302
00:16:31,989 --> 00:16:33,590
we made on our platform in 2014,

303
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:37,893
and we call it DevEx, or developer exchange.

304
00:16:38,993 --> 00:16:42,335
This is the ability for the creators on our platform

305
00:16:43,015 --> 00:16:44,496
to take money out.

306
00:16:45,817 --> 00:16:48,979
So up until this time, for the previous eight years,

307
00:16:50,628 --> 00:16:53,270
They'd been working in a way where they'd make content

308
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:56,191
and share it, and they'd get some virtual currency back.

309
00:16:56,972 --> 00:16:58,473
But it would just accumulate in their account.

310
00:16:59,273 --> 00:17:01,955
They could spend it on things on Roblox, but that was it.

311
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:06,998
In 2014, we said, OK, you guys can take that out

312
00:17:07,178 --> 00:17:08,479
for cold, hard cash.

313
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,682
And this was actually a really hard decision when we made it,

314
00:17:13,122 --> 00:17:16,824
because we already had this huge community there producing

315
00:17:16,864 --> 00:17:17,565
tons of content.

316
00:17:17,865 --> 00:17:19,186
Clearly, people liked the content.

317
00:17:20,563 --> 00:17:24,289
Why would we give them money when they'll do it for free?

318
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:28,916
But what we've seen is this is probably the best decision we ever made,

319
00:17:29,637 --> 00:17:33,724
because it changed the whole nature of how people make content on the platform.

320
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:37,080
They started to take it much more professionally.

321
00:17:37,501 --> 00:17:39,303
These people who had built up all these skills

322
00:17:39,383 --> 00:17:43,167
and connections and community began to create

323
00:17:43,627 --> 00:17:45,770
in a much more serious manner.

324
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:48,593
And that produced a level of game quality

325
00:17:49,013 --> 00:17:50,955
that far outstripped what we had before.

326
00:17:52,427 --> 00:17:56,248
So this is actually very difficult to chart

327
00:17:57,069 --> 00:17:59,630
because it happened over a period of years.

328
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:04,251
But what we see is a combined network effect.

329
00:18:05,111 --> 00:18:06,412
We have two network effects here

330
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:07,832
that are feeding off of each other.

331
00:18:09,053 --> 00:18:11,173
There's a community of creators.

332
00:18:11,853 --> 00:18:13,934
And we see the more creators there are,

333
00:18:14,254 --> 00:18:15,555
the better it is for each creator

334
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:18,756
because they can form these teams and groups of people

335
00:18:18,816 --> 00:18:21,337
and work collaboratively to create awesome content.

336
00:18:22,917 --> 00:18:24,278
And then the better content they make,

337
00:18:25,138 --> 00:18:26,298
we have the player community,

338
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:27,879
and they have their own network effect

339
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:29,059
where the more players there are,

340
00:18:29,779 --> 00:18:31,780
the better an experience it is for each player.

341
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,341
And these two things feed off each other.

342
00:18:35,341 --> 00:18:39,743
So I do believe this was a factor in our growth change,

343
00:18:40,623 --> 00:18:42,724
although it's something that happened

344
00:18:42,764 --> 00:18:43,904
over a long period of time,

345
00:18:44,784 --> 00:18:48,246
and probably can't be a sharp uptick in itself.

346
00:18:50,966 --> 00:18:51,086
So,

347
00:18:52,685 --> 00:18:54,345
Back to our theories.

348
00:18:54,365 --> 00:18:57,727
I can disprove all of them.

349
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:02,088
I can prove that every single one of these theories,

350
00:19:02,268 --> 00:19:04,369
I believe, I could be wrong,

351
00:19:04,989 --> 00:19:07,970
is not the one thing that made Roblox grow.

352
00:19:10,752 --> 00:19:13,152
They're all great, and they all helped.

353
00:19:13,873 --> 00:19:16,914
And the tough thing is, people wanna believe them.

354
00:19:17,334 --> 00:19:18,114
We all wanna believe them

355
00:19:18,154 --> 00:19:20,275
because they're things that made our product better.

356
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:23,312
And they happened around the time of this growth.

357
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:26,034
So they make such a convincing narrative.

358
00:19:28,415 --> 00:19:33,458
So what did change the growth?

359
00:19:34,618 --> 00:19:39,761
So my theory is that it's a lot of these things added together.

360
00:19:41,622 --> 00:19:44,144
And this sounds like a little bit of a cop-out,

361
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,144
but I'm going to explain.

362
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:50,107
So if it's a combination of all these things,

363
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:52,564
there's a natural question, which is,

364
00:19:54,105 --> 00:19:55,886
why would there be such a sudden uptick?

365
00:19:56,786 --> 00:19:59,248
Why wouldn't it just be slowly,

366
00:19:59,288 --> 00:20:01,169
there's one thing and then another thing,

367
00:20:01,189 --> 00:20:02,790
and then it just layers in over time?

368
00:20:04,111 --> 00:20:06,753
And that's an important question.

369
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:09,514
So I believe I have an answer to that question.

370
00:20:10,415 --> 00:20:12,316
And it has to do with the nature

371
00:20:12,917 --> 00:20:14,778
of how people want to play together.

372
00:20:16,976 --> 00:20:22,919
And I'm going to illustrate that by showing a video of kids

373
00:20:22,979 --> 00:20:23,359
playing.

374
00:20:23,379 --> 00:20:24,759
This is kids playing Roblox.

375
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:28,701
These are two of my kids and one of their friends

376
00:20:28,741 --> 00:20:29,541
from down the street.

377
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:31,682
And I'm going to show the video, and then I'm

378
00:20:31,702 --> 00:20:34,003
going to explain why I think it's relevant.

379
00:20:38,148 --> 00:20:38,469
Yes!

380
00:20:39,089 --> 00:20:39,809
No, Zoe!

381
00:20:39,949 --> 00:20:40,470
Zoe!

382
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:40,670
Yes!

383
00:20:41,571 --> 00:20:43,372
You got an assist kill for Leo.

384
00:20:43,452 --> 00:20:44,813
We both killed Leo together.

385
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,554
Now I'm just going to take out his turret.

386
00:20:46,594 --> 00:20:46,774
Yes!

387
00:20:47,514 --> 00:20:48,495
Because there's a crate on the map.

388
00:20:48,515 --> 00:20:49,456
Epic crate!

389
00:20:49,616 --> 00:20:51,217
Oh my god, I can't believe it.

390
00:20:51,337 --> 00:20:52,417
I'm hiding from LeGal.

391
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:54,499
I am so hiding.

392
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:55,399
Look where I'm hiding.

393
00:20:55,419 --> 00:20:56,320
Do you promise that's home?

394
00:20:57,181 --> 00:20:57,701
I promise I will.

395
00:20:57,721 --> 00:20:57,941
It's not.

396
00:20:57,961 --> 00:20:58,101
My god.

397
00:20:58,121 --> 00:21:00,843
Isn't it a good spot?

398
00:21:00,923 --> 00:21:01,083
Yeah.

399
00:21:01,103 --> 00:21:02,104
I'm surprised we killed Leo.

400
00:21:02,164 --> 00:21:02,364
High five.

401
00:21:02,464 --> 00:21:03,244
High five.

402
00:21:03,264 --> 00:21:03,965
High five.

403
00:21:04,005 --> 00:21:04,225
High five.

404
00:21:04,245 --> 00:21:04,525
High five.

405
00:21:04,565 --> 00:21:04,865
High five.

406
00:21:04,886 --> 00:21:05,226
High five.

407
00:21:05,246 --> 00:21:05,566
High five.

408
00:21:07,374 --> 00:21:07,795
Daddy!

409
00:21:07,955 --> 00:21:09,515
We just killed Leo and Polly Pugs.

410
00:21:14,258 --> 00:21:15,458
You can see my daughter at the end.

411
00:21:15,518 --> 00:21:16,639
She realizes I'm recording.

412
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:18,019
She's like, ugh, dad.

413
00:21:21,221 --> 00:21:21,341
But...

414
00:21:22,517 --> 00:21:26,299
The key thing about this, watching kids play like this,

415
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:30,221
is it's maybe a little bit different of a model

416
00:21:30,481 --> 00:21:33,262
than how we adults play.

417
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:35,083
It's very social.

418
00:21:35,923 --> 00:21:39,705
It's completely engaging, and they're constantly talking.

419
00:21:39,945 --> 00:21:41,846
This isn't like an isolated incident.

420
00:21:42,307 --> 00:21:43,507
When they're sitting there and playing,

421
00:21:43,587 --> 00:21:46,169
they're always talking to each other, sharing screens,

422
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:48,230
like messing around with each other.

423
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,591
It's a very different way they engage with the product.

424
00:21:52,201 --> 00:21:56,923
And I think this ties into how Roblox became viral.

425
00:21:58,044 --> 00:22:02,126
So when you think about virality with our demographic,

426
00:22:03,286 --> 00:22:04,767
it's not on Facebook and Twitter.

427
00:22:04,827 --> 00:22:06,728
They aren't sharing links on social media.

428
00:22:06,748 --> 00:22:07,848
They don't have social media.

429
00:22:08,729 --> 00:22:10,089
This is old school virality.

430
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:13,771
This is kids in a classroom, on a playground,

431
00:22:15,092 --> 00:22:15,972
talking to each other.

432
00:22:15,992 --> 00:22:18,834
And when they have a great experience

433
00:22:18,854 --> 00:22:19,674
that they wanna share,

434
00:22:21,229 --> 00:22:23,330
they'll tell people about it, and they'll bring them in.

435
00:22:25,271 --> 00:22:28,874
And so my theory is, at a certain point,

436
00:22:29,794 --> 00:22:31,595
we'd unlocked enough of these things.

437
00:22:31,855 --> 00:22:34,957
We'd found we'd had a product that people wanted.

438
00:22:36,918 --> 00:22:38,299
We unlocked the blockers.

439
00:22:38,879 --> 00:22:40,620
We fixed the things that were kind of broken.

440
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,503
We made the experience work for our audience.

441
00:22:46,068 --> 00:22:50,970
And that opened up their desire to bring in more people.

442
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:54,351
And when you have some kind of critical threshold,

443
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:56,452
three or four kids in one class,

444
00:22:56,893 --> 00:22:58,993
and they're all playing on one system,

445
00:22:59,674 --> 00:23:01,575
they want to bring in that extra kid

446
00:23:01,635 --> 00:23:04,056
because that adds so much to their experience.

447
00:23:07,757 --> 00:23:13,440
So, this is our ultimate answer.

448
00:23:15,418 --> 00:23:20,360
In our story, we took a long big vision.

449
00:23:22,821 --> 00:23:24,922
We worked really hard on it for a long period of time.

450
00:23:25,682 --> 00:23:28,323
We worked and invested in the people and in the product.

451
00:23:30,364 --> 00:23:33,445
And in the end we created a system where it was viral

452
00:23:33,485 --> 00:23:35,346
and it fed this word of mouth experience.

453
00:23:36,826 --> 00:23:40,388
So I'm gonna conclude that there is no one trick

454
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:43,489
that just let growth magically happen.

455
00:23:45,314 --> 00:23:46,675
And is that a good thing or a bad thing?

456
00:23:46,695 --> 00:23:49,277
I think there's pros and there's cons.

457
00:23:50,518 --> 00:23:53,380
So the con is, well, it would be great

458
00:23:53,441 --> 00:23:55,762
if there was one magic trick that everyone could use

459
00:23:55,922 --> 00:23:57,644
and then you just grow like crazy.

460
00:23:58,885 --> 00:24:04,109
But I am glad we live in a world that's different than that.

461
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:11,983
I like living in a world where we try to build really difficult products, really challenging

462
00:24:12,063 --> 00:24:17,225
big things, and when we succeed, that's where the real interest happens.

463
00:24:18,926 --> 00:24:23,268
It's better than a world where it's just armies of growth hackers fighting against each other

464
00:24:23,308 --> 00:24:23,748
with tricks.

465
00:24:25,823 --> 00:24:29,124
So I can't promise this approach will work for everybody

466
00:24:29,185 --> 00:24:34,486
in every situation, but I think I encourage everyone

467
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:37,127
to consider it as a potential strategy.

468
00:24:39,508 --> 00:24:40,108
Thank you guys.

469
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:53,732
Are there any questions?

470
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:03,171
While other people are thinking of questions,

471
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:05,072
it's not totally on topic, but I'm curious,

472
00:25:05,812 --> 00:25:08,514
in this growth spike, how your creator,

473
00:25:08,554 --> 00:25:10,735
like what percentage of your population is creators,

474
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:13,036
how that's grown with your player base?

475
00:25:13,056 --> 00:25:15,317
Like is it, have you seen like a linear relationship,

476
00:25:15,377 --> 00:25:16,417
or is it lagging now?

477
00:25:16,437 --> 00:25:17,138
How's that look?

478
00:25:18,768 --> 00:25:19,809
Yeah, that's a good question.

479
00:25:19,889 --> 00:25:23,371
So the question is, is there a linear relationship

480
00:25:23,391 --> 00:25:26,673
between the growth in our players and our creators?

481
00:25:27,834 --> 00:25:31,176
And mostly we find it's a little bit sublinear.

482
00:25:31,816 --> 00:25:36,139
So they both grow and they track each other.

483
00:25:37,362 --> 00:25:41,044
But there are a little bit faster growth in players than creators.

484
00:25:41,084 --> 00:25:44,845
And I think this makes sense that there's a little bit fewer people,

485
00:25:44,885 --> 00:25:46,987
especially as you get out of the early adopters,

486
00:25:47,687 --> 00:25:50,548
that are as excited on the platform.

487
00:25:51,089 --> 00:25:54,310
But for us in particular, we find that

488
00:25:55,447 --> 00:25:58,328
Our community, there's a lot of blending

489
00:25:58,368 --> 00:25:59,608
between the two types of people.

490
00:26:00,248 --> 00:26:03,489
And especially with children who want to be creative,

491
00:26:04,049 --> 00:26:06,450
they'll play one day and then they'll create another day.

492
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:10,051
And so there's always gonna be some crossover.

493
00:26:10,912 --> 00:26:11,192
Thank you.

494
00:26:11,572 --> 00:26:11,852
Thanks.

495
00:26:14,493 --> 00:26:14,693
Hi.

496
00:26:15,153 --> 00:26:15,273
Hi.

497
00:26:15,733 --> 00:26:18,174
Did you ask any of your users, I guess,

498
00:26:18,574 --> 00:26:20,855
before the growth spurt and after the growth spurt

499
00:26:20,875 --> 00:26:22,736
to see if there was any delta in reasons

500
00:26:22,796 --> 00:26:25,157
why they might have signed up and started playing?

501
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:27,537
So that's a good question.

502
00:26:28,538 --> 00:26:35,663
Did we gather good user data on what was changing before

503
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:36,324
or after?

504
00:26:36,744 --> 00:26:39,366
The answer is not great data.

505
00:26:39,586 --> 00:26:43,169
Unfortunately, we have started doing more

506
00:26:43,209 --> 00:26:47,172
of that user gathering data since then,

507
00:26:47,632 --> 00:26:49,474
but we didn't have it in place at the time,

508
00:26:49,554 --> 00:26:52,316
so we unfortunately can't go back and get that information.

509
00:26:55,942 --> 00:27:00,883
With a bunch of different creators in your ecosystem and a bunch of different people spending money in those games

510
00:27:01,043 --> 00:27:08,344
Do you take any responsibility or how do you manage the longevity of something that somebody else has created or is still creating for users?

511
00:27:08,724 --> 00:27:16,186
While knowing that your spenders in that economy have an expectation that their money is going to be valuable in that user-generated content

512
00:27:16,986 --> 00:27:18,347
Today, but also months from now

513
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:24,423
Great, yeah, so I'll repeat the question,

514
00:27:24,463 --> 00:27:28,208
which is if users are spending in a game,

515
00:27:28,368 --> 00:27:30,891
how do we ensure that that game, what they've bought,

516
00:27:30,931 --> 00:27:32,893
is still valid down the road?

517
00:27:33,654 --> 00:27:36,958
So the first thing we do is we have a commitment

518
00:27:37,458 --> 00:27:39,761
to make sure we don't break old content.

519
00:27:40,949 --> 00:27:45,472
We go to extraordinary lengths to make sure that old content is still relevant.

520
00:27:46,513 --> 00:27:50,916
And we work with the creators to make sure that we don't cause them problems.

521
00:27:52,697 --> 00:27:59,382
We find that most games still operate, if they're making money and they have a significant

522
00:28:00,102 --> 00:28:04,585
community involvement in their game, they will continue to operate that game and not

523
00:28:04,625 --> 00:28:04,966
break it.

524
00:28:05,386 --> 00:28:06,947
There are times when...

525
00:28:09,309 --> 00:28:12,090
When things like that do happen, somebody bought something

526
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:14,852
in a game, and the game creator broke it and doesn't care,

527
00:28:15,452 --> 00:28:16,372
it's relatively rare.

528
00:28:16,412 --> 00:28:17,193
It does happen.

529
00:28:18,233 --> 00:28:21,175
I'm not exactly sure on our policy at that point in time.

530
00:28:21,215 --> 00:28:23,956
But we do sometimes offer refunds in certain situations.

531
00:28:29,242 --> 00:28:31,404
Hockey stick growth is kind of a double-edged sword.

532
00:28:32,104 --> 00:28:34,025
With that growth comes management problems,

533
00:28:34,065 --> 00:28:36,506
scaling problems, not of the systems necessarily,

534
00:28:36,547 --> 00:28:37,107
but the humans.

535
00:28:38,027 --> 00:28:41,069
Additionally, it increases speculation on your brand.

536
00:28:41,589 --> 00:28:44,211
And I'm not sure if Roblox is publicly traded or not,

537
00:28:44,251 --> 00:28:46,612
but that can tend to be quite volatile.

538
00:28:47,133 --> 00:28:52,536
How are you addressing the non-engineering risks

539
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:53,676
of explosive growth?

540
00:28:55,763 --> 00:28:56,304
Good question.

541
00:28:56,944 --> 00:29:00,006
So how do we handle the other parts of exclusive growth,

542
00:29:00,046 --> 00:29:00,826
the downsides?

543
00:29:01,726 --> 00:29:03,707
So first, Roblox is a privately held company.

544
00:29:04,988 --> 00:29:09,851
And so we don't have to worry about external pressures,

545
00:29:09,871 --> 00:29:11,151
which are tough, I'm glad.

546
00:29:13,112 --> 00:29:16,534
At the time when we were going through this phase,

547
00:29:18,649 --> 00:29:20,390
I think a lot of it came down to our culture.

548
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:25,351
And there were challenges, but what we did was

549
00:29:25,491 --> 00:29:28,732
we grew slowly within our means.

550
00:29:28,832 --> 00:29:30,992
We didn't say, okay, now we're a different company.

551
00:29:31,672 --> 00:29:34,333
Now we're going to be like that company over there,

552
00:29:34,393 --> 00:29:35,513
we're gonna rethink ourselves.

553
00:29:36,393 --> 00:29:40,234
So we stayed within our existing plan

554
00:29:40,274 --> 00:29:41,775
and didn't try and overshoot.

555
00:29:42,679 --> 00:29:46,244
We didn't take, I think where people can get into trouble

556
00:29:47,026 --> 00:29:49,229
is saying, I've gotta capture this thing now.

557
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:51,232
I better hire a thousand people tomorrow

558
00:29:52,033 --> 00:29:53,515
because we're this other company now.

559
00:29:54,497 --> 00:29:55,258
And we didn't do that.

560
00:29:55,638 --> 00:29:57,381
So that seemed to work for us.

561
00:29:58,182 --> 00:29:58,383
Thank you.

562
00:30:00,728 --> 00:30:08,118
Hi. Since observing the growth in the Turkish market when you opened your German servers for the game,

563
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:13,506
have you developed any sort of scheme to track potential player bases

564
00:30:13,586 --> 00:30:17,271
and see if there's interest in having servers set up in that region of the world?

565
00:30:18,603 --> 00:30:19,223
Good question.

566
00:30:20,004 --> 00:30:22,726
So are we tracking interest in different parts of the world,

567
00:30:22,806 --> 00:30:25,608
and how do we determine how we're going to approach it?

568
00:30:26,248 --> 00:30:26,628
We do.

569
00:30:26,749 --> 00:30:30,711
So it turns out that currently about half of our usage

570
00:30:30,731 --> 00:30:31,392
is international.

571
00:30:32,384 --> 00:30:33,625
maybe just a little less than half.

572
00:30:34,645 --> 00:30:39,868
So we have a ton of early signal on where users want us to go.

573
00:30:40,568 --> 00:30:43,349
And it's interesting that some countries tend to be much more

574
00:30:43,409 --> 00:30:44,170
popular than others.

575
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:46,851
So for example, South Korea loves Roblox.

576
00:30:47,251 --> 00:30:48,912
Japan less so today.

577
00:30:50,733 --> 00:30:53,134
And even though we haven't done anything in particular

578
00:30:53,154 --> 00:30:53,874
for either country.

579
00:30:54,114 --> 00:30:57,096
So we get a lot of strong signals off of the existing traffic.

580
00:30:57,776 --> 00:31:04,121
And then we get to target where we want to deploy more services, translations, things like that.

581
00:31:05,361 --> 00:31:10,425
Are there any identifiers that are specifically outside of the game that you've noticed in particular?

582
00:31:11,285 --> 00:31:15,508
So one that I've noticed is YouTube streamers.

583
00:31:16,128 --> 00:31:22,693
So that seems to be a strong indicator that there's a cultural affinity for the product.

584
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:26,636
So with South Korea, Thailand, some other places,

585
00:31:27,716 --> 00:31:29,558
unexpectedly you get these streamers

586
00:31:29,618 --> 00:31:31,659
who have millions of views of Roblox

587
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:35,102
that's maybe out of proportion to the traffic

588
00:31:35,162 --> 00:31:36,103
from that country itself.

589
00:31:36,583 --> 00:31:39,726
And so that potentially is one of our indicators

590
00:31:39,806 --> 00:31:41,467
for hey, we should take advantage of this.

591
00:31:42,468 --> 00:31:42,788
Thank you.

592
00:31:43,088 --> 00:31:43,328
Thanks.

593
00:31:45,364 --> 00:31:48,306
Hi, were there any factors you identified as critical

594
00:31:48,366 --> 00:31:51,389
to the very steady 30% year over year growth

595
00:31:51,429 --> 00:31:52,410
prior to the hockey stick

596
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:54,212
that were not talked about already?

597
00:31:55,133 --> 00:32:00,097
Yeah, so how did we identify the steady 30%?

598
00:32:00,738 --> 00:32:03,140
So what's funny about that, I've thought about this.

599
00:32:06,235 --> 00:32:07,796
I guess this is natural to humans.

600
00:32:07,896 --> 00:32:09,077
You have some kind of status quo,

601
00:32:09,097 --> 00:32:11,339
and then you just accept that, oh, this is the thing, right?

602
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,761
But we don't actually have any way

603
00:32:13,781 --> 00:32:16,123
to prove that that was the thing we should have

604
00:32:16,143 --> 00:32:17,584
expected versus the change.

605
00:32:18,905 --> 00:32:20,727
So the answer is not really.

606
00:32:20,747 --> 00:32:25,071
The nature of the growth at the time, I think,

607
00:32:26,151 --> 00:32:29,394
was word of mouth, viral growth.

608
00:32:29,454 --> 00:32:30,895
We didn't do a lot of advertising.

609
00:32:31,876 --> 00:32:32,397
We never did.

610
00:32:32,997 --> 00:32:33,157
But.

611
00:32:36,602 --> 00:32:38,083
So I think there was a coefficient

612
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:40,264
of how fast people come onto the platform.

613
00:32:41,665 --> 00:32:45,728
And that 30 to 50% represented that.

614
00:32:46,428 --> 00:32:48,009
But I can't prove it.

615
00:32:48,609 --> 00:32:51,931
There's no mathematical basis for either phase, I guess.

616
00:32:55,189 --> 00:32:58,553
Hi, I have two young girls that absolutely love Roblox.

617
00:32:58,653 --> 00:32:58,753
Yes.

618
00:32:59,053 --> 00:33:03,117
I spent hundreds of dollars on great games and Nintendo Switch,

619
00:33:03,157 --> 00:33:06,801
and they prefer to play Roblox, which sometimes infuriates me.

620
00:33:07,202 --> 00:33:08,042
My question is.

621
00:33:10,005 --> 00:33:19,277
My question is, as a parent, since the players are so young, and anybody can create, and anybody can create whatever they want,

622
00:33:20,378 --> 00:33:27,868
do you have, are you thinking, or do you already have something in place that monitors the content and curates it in some way?

623
00:33:28,602 --> 00:33:29,462
Yeah, good question.

624
00:33:29,482 --> 00:33:32,885
So how do we monitor, moderate, and curate the content?

625
00:33:32,985 --> 00:33:36,668
So because we are targeting young children,

626
00:33:37,428 --> 00:33:42,072
this is built into our DNA from every phase of our product.

627
00:33:42,192 --> 00:33:46,515
So every chat message, every piece of text

628
00:33:46,736 --> 00:33:48,977
goes through scrupulous text filtering.

629
00:33:49,938 --> 00:33:53,180
We have teams of moderators that stand by and react

630
00:33:53,241 --> 00:33:55,642
in very quick time to anything that's behaving badly,

631
00:33:56,343 --> 00:33:56,843
any kind of.

632
00:33:57,344 --> 00:34:01,528
anti-social behavior, any content that is not appropriate.

633
00:34:02,028 --> 00:34:04,531
Every image, sound, mesh, and so forth

634
00:34:04,571 --> 00:34:05,872
goes through a moderation queue

635
00:34:05,892 --> 00:34:08,274
before it can view it on our site, and so forth.

636
00:34:09,555 --> 00:34:10,496
We can't be perfect.

637
00:34:11,297 --> 00:34:14,300
We can't absolutely catch everything and guarantee it,

638
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,443
but it's very good.

639
00:34:18,404 --> 00:34:20,366
And we're always working to make it better.

640
00:34:22,467 --> 00:34:23,667
Thank you for your presentation.

641
00:34:24,407 --> 00:34:27,168
So you mentioned you have quite a few players

642
00:34:27,268 --> 00:34:29,028
in South Korea and Japan.

643
00:34:29,528 --> 00:34:31,508
So I'm wondering, are you thinking about

644
00:34:31,608 --> 00:34:34,669
creating some content that caters to the Asian audience?

645
00:34:34,749 --> 00:34:37,230
And also just how do you think about

646
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,810
the timing of international expansion in general?

647
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:41,770
Yeah, yeah.

648
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:43,171
So the question is,

649
00:34:44,471 --> 00:34:46,871
what do we think about the timing of international expansion

650
00:34:46,931 --> 00:34:50,132
and do we want to create content for the Asian audience?

651
00:34:50,272 --> 00:34:50,392
So...

652
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:55,652
What we want to do, we don't create any of the content ourselves.

653
00:34:56,092 --> 00:35:01,395
Our goal is to make the best tools, the best platform that enables content creation from

654
00:35:01,415 --> 00:35:01,955
the community.

655
00:35:03,656 --> 00:35:08,979
And we do believe there are cultural differences in different parts of the world, and people

656
00:35:09,019 --> 00:35:10,500
do want to experience different content.

657
00:35:11,587 --> 00:35:12,808
There's gonna be a lot of overlap,

658
00:35:12,848 --> 00:35:15,850
but we wanna support all of the variety.

659
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:18,112
That's one of the great powers

660
00:35:18,152 --> 00:35:21,114
of having a really long tail and a huge catalog.

661
00:35:21,834 --> 00:35:25,597
So the way we achieve that is we build

662
00:35:25,757 --> 00:35:29,680
really robust communities of creators around the world

663
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,562
in all these different cultures and countries.

664
00:35:32,622 --> 00:35:35,925
And we make sure that we provide the tools that let them create.

665
00:35:36,646 --> 00:35:40,269
And then we make sure that the discovery part works as well.

666
00:35:40,769 --> 00:35:45,053
So in fact, today on Roblox, you can go to our games page

667
00:35:45,093 --> 00:35:48,435
and see games that are popular near you.

668
00:35:48,676 --> 00:35:50,277
And that list will be different in Korea

669
00:35:50,317 --> 00:35:51,418
than it will be in America.

670
00:35:52,099 --> 00:35:54,360
And as we really expand internationally

671
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,943
over the next couple of years, hopefully we're

672
00:35:56,963 --> 00:35:59,805
going to see a lot more really cool differentiation

673
00:35:59,845 --> 00:36:00,345
in that area.

674
00:36:00,846 --> 00:36:01,186
Thank you.

675
00:36:01,366 --> 00:36:01,626
Thank you.

676
00:36:02,586 --> 00:36:07,374
Hi, you mentioned that there's basically a double network effect.

677
00:36:07,734 --> 00:36:11,821
Did you realize that in order to unlock one, you needed another one?

678
00:36:11,861 --> 00:36:13,283
Was there like a chicken egg problem?

679
00:36:13,323 --> 00:36:14,064
How did you solve it?

680
00:36:14,874 --> 00:36:17,955
Yeah, so how did we solve the double network effect

681
00:36:18,475 --> 00:36:21,536
in unlocking creators versus players?

682
00:36:21,856 --> 00:36:24,196
I think we started with a single network effect.

683
00:36:24,716 --> 00:36:26,577
And we really started very small.

684
00:36:27,377 --> 00:36:29,738
We started with just the simple vision

685
00:36:29,798 --> 00:36:32,578
and built up from having two players online

686
00:36:32,598 --> 00:36:35,359
to wow, we've got 10 players online at once,

687
00:36:35,419 --> 00:36:36,199
that's amazing.

688
00:36:36,659 --> 00:36:41,240
Now it's 1.5 million, but it was a very slow growth

689
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,240
to get to that phase.

690
00:36:42,681 --> 00:36:42,841
Yeah.

691
00:36:44,617 --> 00:36:46,699
Did that mean you were creating content initially?

692
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:50,141
So only at the very beginning, like literally only

693
00:36:50,582 --> 00:36:53,764
in the first few weeks of creation.

694
00:36:53,804 --> 00:36:56,486
Because in the beginning, we had to create a tool

695
00:36:56,546 --> 00:36:57,727
to create the content anyway.

696
00:36:57,927 --> 00:36:59,228
And as soon as we had that tool, we

697
00:36:59,268 --> 00:37:01,029
could give it to the people who wanted to play.

698
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:02,410
Got it.

699
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:02,590
Cool.

700
00:37:02,811 --> 00:37:06,413
Thanks.

701
00:37:06,493 --> 00:37:09,535
Did you find that the distribution of play

702
00:37:09,756 --> 00:37:11,877
within the games changed as the growth grew?

703
00:37:13,693 --> 00:37:17,616
So did the distribution of play change within the games as the growth grew?

704
00:37:17,636 --> 00:37:17,676
so

705
00:37:20,038 --> 00:37:25,463
We didn't see any major change. I would say we always have a pretty long tail of content

706
00:37:26,023 --> 00:37:28,726
There's a few games that are super popular

707
00:37:30,187 --> 00:37:32,449
There's maybe a top thousand that have

708
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:36,152
like dozens to hundreds of people in them at a time

709
00:37:37,106 --> 00:37:39,690
And then there's a super long tale of pretty obscure stuff.

710
00:37:40,111 --> 00:37:42,535
That fundamental distribution did not change

711
00:37:42,775 --> 00:37:44,418
when we had our growth story.

712
00:37:49,065 --> 00:37:49,586
That's time?

713
00:37:50,107 --> 00:37:51,509
OK, thank you everyone so much.

714
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:52,331
Really appreciate it.
