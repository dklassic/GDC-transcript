1
00:00:05,361 --> 00:00:07,963
So this is a series of three micro talks

2
00:00:07,983 --> 00:00:08,844
centered around a theme.

3
00:00:09,444 --> 00:00:12,106
And that theme is how to run an indie studio

4
00:00:12,146 --> 00:00:12,967
without a surprise hit.

5
00:00:13,687 --> 00:00:14,508
I'm Christopher Langmuir.

6
00:00:14,888 --> 00:00:16,650
I'm the creative director of An Enemy Hug Interactive.

7
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:18,031
And these are my fellow speakers.

8
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:19,052
This is Teresa Duranger.

9
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:20,833
She's the CEO of TumbleGates Games.

10
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:22,054
And this is Tanya Short.

11
00:00:22,294 --> 00:00:24,296
She's the captain of Kit Fox Games.

12
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:26,397
And we don't have a lot of time, so I'm just

13
00:00:26,417 --> 00:00:30,180
going to dive right into it, if my slides will advance,

14
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:33,243
which they aren't.

15
00:00:35,715 --> 00:00:36,075
OK, cool.

16
00:00:36,095 --> 00:00:38,856
All right, so what do our three studios have in common?

17
00:00:38,876 --> 00:00:40,136
Why are we all in this panel together?

18
00:00:40,756 --> 00:00:44,158
So what we are is we're all about the same size.

19
00:00:44,178 --> 00:00:45,158
We're all about the same age.

20
00:00:45,198 --> 00:00:46,438
We've been around about five years,

21
00:00:46,478 --> 00:00:48,959
and we've all got 10-ish employees.

22
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:51,880
But most importantly, we don't have a runaway hit

23
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,441
that has founded the backbone of our company's budget and runway.

24
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:58,102
None of us have a product that has just moved a totally insane

25
00:00:58,122 --> 00:00:59,143
number of units out of nowhere.

26
00:00:59,503 --> 00:01:01,343
All of us are sort of very one foot in front of the other,

27
00:01:01,423 --> 00:01:03,924
but we've still grown a lot over the last five years.

28
00:01:04,004 --> 00:01:05,305
And I want to talk a little bit about how.

29
00:01:06,539 --> 00:01:07,700
So I'll start with my micro talk,

30
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:10,423
which is about how to get client work

31
00:01:10,663 --> 00:01:12,926
and balance it against original IP development.

32
00:01:14,387 --> 00:01:17,170
So now I personally only have about seven minutes or so,

33
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,192
so if you're like watching this on the vault later,

34
00:01:19,593 --> 00:01:23,016
set it to like half speed, but if you're here, sorry.

35
00:01:26,605 --> 00:01:30,028
But seriously, my caveat is I don't actually have the answers.

36
00:01:30,448 --> 00:01:30,648
Right?

37
00:01:30,708 --> 00:01:32,690
I'm going to give you a whole bunch of things that

38
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:35,812
are about our experience and what I've learned,

39
00:01:36,092 --> 00:01:37,433
but they're very contextual to us.

40
00:01:37,814 --> 00:01:40,516
Like for example, our studio was founded in Canada.

41
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:42,697
Operating in different countries is different.

42
00:01:42,817 --> 00:01:44,279
Different clients are different.

43
00:01:44,639 --> 00:01:46,680
You and your team are going to be different than me

44
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,321
and my team.

45
00:01:47,381 --> 00:01:48,742
Just because something worked for us

46
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:50,343
doesn't mean it's going to work for you.

47
00:01:50,924 --> 00:01:53,707
That being said, if I could go back in time five years

48
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:55,870
and talk to myself before I started this studio,

49
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,391
there's a handful of things that I think

50
00:01:57,431 --> 00:01:59,854
are pretty self-evident now that I'd love to tell me.

51
00:02:00,015 --> 00:02:01,837
And I can't do that, but there might be like

52
00:02:02,498 --> 00:02:03,799
future me's in the audience,

53
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,561
so I'm gonna say these things to you.

54
00:02:07,163 --> 00:02:09,186
So a bit about Anemone Hug Interactive, my studio.

55
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:12,672
So like the rest of the shows, we've been in business

56
00:02:12,712 --> 00:02:14,794
for about four years, and we've grown a lot

57
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:15,835
through that time period.

58
00:02:16,096 --> 00:02:17,917
And through that whole time, from the first year

59
00:02:17,957 --> 00:02:20,980
to the fifth, we've spent 50% of all hours company-wide

60
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,542
on internal IP development.

61
00:02:23,262 --> 00:02:24,644
And that's a direct result of the fact

62
00:02:24,664 --> 00:02:25,825
that we've done a lot of client work.

63
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:29,128
That's obviously really great, but what are other reasons

64
00:02:29,168 --> 00:02:31,030
why you might wanna pursue this way of running a business?

65
00:02:32,031 --> 00:02:32,211
Okay.

66
00:02:34,504 --> 00:02:35,944
You can't hide from the business stuff.

67
00:02:35,984 --> 00:02:37,685
Like you actually have to be serious about this.

68
00:02:37,725 --> 00:02:38,385
Like you have to do,

69
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,586
like you actually have to incorporate

70
00:02:40,626 --> 00:02:43,287
and you actually have to set up legal agreements

71
00:02:43,307 --> 00:02:45,048
and you actually have to have real negotiations

72
00:02:45,068 --> 00:02:46,748
and you have to do accounting and da da da da da.

73
00:02:46,788 --> 00:02:48,629
Like if you're just hiding in a basement

74
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:50,890
for like a bunch of years working on your first game,

75
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:53,711
it can shelter you a lot from those business realities

76
00:02:53,731 --> 00:02:55,932
that you're gonna really need to know how to do

77
00:02:56,352 --> 00:02:57,252
once you've shipped a title.

78
00:02:59,284 --> 00:03:02,807
And with that reliable income stream that is not from product,

79
00:03:02,867 --> 00:03:05,329
you're going to be able to hire a lot more diverse team.

80
00:03:05,689 --> 00:03:08,191
Overwhelmingly, the people with free time and capital

81
00:03:08,491 --> 00:03:10,493
are English-speaking North American white men,

82
00:03:11,634 --> 00:03:14,156
people that look like me and the other business partner who

83
00:03:14,216 --> 00:03:15,136
is involved in this equation.

84
00:03:16,277 --> 00:03:18,119
Many people can't work speculatively.

85
00:03:18,219 --> 00:03:20,801
Some people need a stable job, no matter how talented

86
00:03:20,841 --> 00:03:21,441
or driven they are.

87
00:03:21,741 --> 00:03:23,323
If you can offer people real employment

88
00:03:23,363 --> 00:03:24,403
while you're running your studio,

89
00:03:24,824 --> 00:03:27,186
you're going to have access to a much larger pool of talent,

90
00:03:27,226 --> 00:03:28,547
and it's going to make everything a lot easier.

91
00:03:30,962 --> 00:03:33,403
So now, before you actually start your studio,

92
00:03:33,423 --> 00:03:34,363
before you do anything at all,

93
00:03:34,383 --> 00:03:36,084
there's just a few quick tips I'd like to give you.

94
00:03:37,364 --> 00:03:38,885
First, these two things are really important

95
00:03:38,905 --> 00:03:39,405
if you can do it.

96
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:43,266
One, have an entire year's worth of runway before you begin.

97
00:03:43,366 --> 00:03:45,707
Even if you don't make a single dollar in the first year,

98
00:03:45,747 --> 00:03:46,648
you should be okay.

99
00:03:47,028 --> 00:03:47,848
Try and plan around this.

100
00:03:47,888 --> 00:03:50,029
You might not need it for all 365 days,

101
00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:51,789
but you'll be really grateful that you had it.

102
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:55,192
Two, if you are currently employed, get credit now.

103
00:03:55,312 --> 00:03:57,574
This seems super evident to be in retrospect,

104
00:03:57,895 --> 00:04:00,677
but it is way easier to get credit if you have a stable job

105
00:04:00,897 --> 00:04:04,020
than if you are an unemployed person who owns a studio with no value.

106
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:07,023
Right? Try and do both of these first.

107
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,907
But third, and this is my most important takeaway from the entire talk.

108
00:04:11,644 --> 00:04:12,785
is get a mentor, right?

109
00:04:12,925 --> 00:04:14,626
My previous statements about, like,

110
00:04:14,706 --> 00:04:15,707
I don't have the answers,

111
00:04:15,787 --> 00:04:18,588
is because my advice to you is not contextual, right?

112
00:04:18,628 --> 00:04:20,129
Like, you're gonna find someone

113
00:04:20,189 --> 00:04:21,450
who's in the space you're in,

114
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:23,711
who's in the physical location is who's in,

115
00:04:23,892 --> 00:04:25,573
who's doing the kind of stuff you wanna be doing,

116
00:04:25,853 --> 00:04:26,653
who's bigger than you are.

117
00:04:26,853 --> 00:04:28,574
Someone who's already gone through the growing pains

118
00:04:28,594 --> 00:04:30,135
that you are hopefully going to go through.

119
00:04:30,456 --> 00:04:32,457
That person will be able to give you much better advice

120
00:04:32,477 --> 00:04:34,058
than anything in this talk I can give you.

121
00:04:34,338 --> 00:04:36,699
If you remember only one thing from my talk,

122
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,040
let it be this one point.

123
00:04:40,278 --> 00:04:41,818
So now we're getting into the part of the talk

124
00:04:41,838 --> 00:04:43,219
that arguably everyone cares about.

125
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:45,700
And that's how do you actually get client work?

126
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,000
And I'm gonna begin with a spoiler.

127
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,461
All right, this is an age test.

128
00:04:50,481 --> 00:04:54,403
Okay, it's not this spoiler either.

129
00:04:54,423 --> 00:04:56,123
So what's the spoiler?

130
00:04:56,723 --> 00:04:56,983
This one.

131
00:04:57,906 --> 00:04:59,047
There's no magic wand.

132
00:04:59,107 --> 00:05:00,628
There's no secret trick.

133
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:02,569
There's no directory of client work

134
00:05:02,609 --> 00:05:03,810
that you can go onto online

135
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:06,391
that only me and a handful of people know about.

136
00:05:06,411 --> 00:05:08,633
There's no list of potential clients.

137
00:05:08,893 --> 00:05:11,234
There's no one trick that game devs hate.

138
00:05:11,495 --> 00:05:12,575
There's nothing like that.

139
00:05:12,615 --> 00:05:14,216
It's hard to get client work,

140
00:05:14,436 --> 00:05:15,857
and it's hard to do client work.

141
00:05:17,138 --> 00:05:17,939
Now, with that in mind,

142
00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:19,340
how do you actually do it, even if it's hard?

143
00:05:20,578 --> 00:05:22,379
So the first thing, and people hate this one,

144
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,980
is always be networking.

145
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,801
I hear a lot of people grumble about this,

146
00:05:25,901 --> 00:05:27,682
and if you manage to succeed without doing this,

147
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:28,543
you are a unicorn,

148
00:05:28,563 --> 00:05:30,564
and you probably don't need any of my advice.

149
00:05:31,204 --> 00:05:32,225
You're gonna need clients,

150
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:33,686
you're gonna need employees,

151
00:05:33,706 --> 00:05:34,646
you're gonna need friends,

152
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:35,607
you're gonna need allies,

153
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:36,527
you're gonna need publishers,

154
00:05:36,547 --> 00:05:37,788
you're gonna need everything under the sun,

155
00:05:37,988 --> 00:05:39,228
and you don't know what you're gonna need

156
00:05:39,269 --> 00:05:40,649
before you need it.

157
00:05:40,989 --> 00:05:42,850
These people are going to be your future clients,

158
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:44,031
they're gonna be your future partners,

159
00:05:44,051 --> 00:05:45,132
they're gonna help you ship games,

160
00:05:45,152 --> 00:05:46,352
they're gonna help you do work,

161
00:05:46,372 --> 00:05:47,113
they're gonna give you money.

162
00:05:48,277 --> 00:05:50,337
Networking puts you in contact with other people,

163
00:05:50,397 --> 00:05:51,198
and people matter.

164
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:53,939
Grow your team.

165
00:05:55,099 --> 00:05:56,760
Provide solutions, not labor.

166
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,081
What I mean by this is become a full service outfit.

167
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:01,542
Try and avoid single contributor contracts.

168
00:06:01,822 --> 00:06:03,643
What you wanna be doing is you wanna be pitching things

169
00:06:03,683 --> 00:06:06,684
like features, or ports, or full games.

170
00:06:07,004 --> 00:06:07,945
You wanna be offering something

171
00:06:07,965 --> 00:06:09,805
that there isn't an obvious substitution for.

172
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:14,740
Now, how do you get those ones?

173
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,861
Is you want to be climbing the ladder.

174
00:06:15,901 --> 00:06:17,542
I know I just said go broad at the beginning

175
00:06:17,562 --> 00:06:19,063
and network like literally all the time.

176
00:06:19,363 --> 00:06:21,025
What we also want to be doing is your clients

177
00:06:21,065 --> 00:06:22,886
are overwhelmingly going to be organizations

178
00:06:23,266 --> 00:06:24,507
that are a little bit bigger than you.

179
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:27,049
Really big orgs, sometimes you'll get work for them,

180
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:28,469
but there's a ton of other people in the mix

181
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,170
to get those jobs.

182
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,532
And organizations and studios that are the exact

183
00:06:31,552 --> 00:06:33,673
same size as you, you probably can't hire them.

184
00:06:33,913 --> 00:06:35,774
So remember, they probably can't hire you.

185
00:06:36,175 --> 00:06:37,475
There will be exceptions to this,

186
00:06:37,535 --> 00:06:40,057
but generally speaking, always be trying to target

187
00:06:40,077 --> 00:06:41,798
the people who are just a bit bigger than you.

188
00:06:42,359 --> 00:06:44,319
And if you continue to grow year over year,

189
00:06:44,499 --> 00:06:46,139
you're gonna be meeting new members

190
00:06:46,299 --> 00:06:47,640
of those ladders of rungs.

191
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,020
So you're gonna wanna meet a whole bunch of people

192
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,701
one year and the next year, the group after that.

193
00:06:52,961 --> 00:06:55,682
Also, don't always look for game studios.

194
00:06:55,962 --> 00:06:58,602
Look for games adjacent clients, non-games clients.

195
00:06:58,922 --> 00:07:00,963
The advantages of these are manifold.

196
00:07:01,443 --> 00:07:02,663
Being a direct contractor means

197
00:07:02,683 --> 00:07:04,023
you can command better rates,

198
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,504
there's not an obvious substitution to internal development,

199
00:07:06,904 --> 00:07:08,625
and just everything's easier.

200
00:07:08,665 --> 00:07:10,285
If you can get these kind of contracts to do,

201
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:11,905
you'll make your life a lot more straightforward.

202
00:07:13,974 --> 00:07:16,975
This one also seems pretty obvious to me, but I haven't fought hard enough for it,

203
00:07:17,456 --> 00:07:22,118
and it's really hurt us in the long run, is get attribution. You want to start from a point

204
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:26,020
where your game studio's name is at the very beginning of the game you're working along

205
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,521
with all of the other studios on it. You're not going to get that, but that's going to be the

206
00:07:29,561 --> 00:07:33,563
point you want to start in negotiations and work your way back from them. Attribution lets other

207
00:07:33,603 --> 00:07:36,824
people know what you've done, and that's really important for getting future work,

208
00:07:37,064 --> 00:07:38,765
and we've been bad about that, and it's hurt us.

209
00:07:40,604 --> 00:07:42,005
However, we've been really good about this one,

210
00:07:42,085 --> 00:07:43,345
and I know this seems pretty obvious,

211
00:07:43,405 --> 00:07:44,946
but you get so much out of this.

212
00:07:46,047 --> 00:07:47,948
Deliver on time and deliver on budget.

213
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:50,849
Be involved in the project estimation and get good at it.

214
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:53,350
People are gonna tell other people that you're good at this

215
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:56,172
and this is completely invaluable in this industry.

216
00:07:56,572 --> 00:07:57,852
Very few people are good at this

217
00:07:58,113 --> 00:07:59,333
and it's gonna get you a lot of work.

218
00:08:00,053 --> 00:08:01,554
Also, working on your own games,

219
00:08:01,894 --> 00:08:03,235
it's really good at being good at this.

220
00:08:03,415 --> 00:08:05,596
Like, knowing that you're gonna launch your own title

221
00:08:05,636 --> 00:08:07,697
on a particular timeline is really gonna help you.

222
00:08:09,987 --> 00:08:12,067
So how do you balance this against internal development?

223
00:08:13,548 --> 00:08:16,349
Now, keep in mind that all of the other stuff I just said

224
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:18,109
is going to seriously burn you out creatively.

225
00:08:18,489 --> 00:08:20,070
I personally struggle with this a lot.

226
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,751
Development on our games suffers from my focus on business

227
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:25,612
issues, and I'm not entirely clear on how I'm supposed

228
00:08:25,632 --> 00:08:26,612
to compartmentalize those.

229
00:08:27,152 --> 00:08:29,733
Just be aware that getting and delivering client work

230
00:08:29,773 --> 00:08:30,854
is going to take a lot out of you

231
00:08:30,894 --> 00:08:32,314
and is going to take a lot out of your focus

232
00:08:32,354 --> 00:08:34,295
on a creative endeavor, like launching your first game.

233
00:08:34,775 --> 00:08:35,235
Let me know how.

234
00:08:35,335 --> 00:08:36,636
If you figure out how to solve this,

235
00:08:36,736 --> 00:08:37,816
I still haven't figured this one out.

236
00:08:39,714 --> 00:08:42,036
This lack of focus has really tangible impacts

237
00:08:42,076 --> 00:08:43,096
on your internal development.

238
00:08:43,537 --> 00:08:46,719
Don't assume that just because you have 50% of the time

239
00:08:46,739 --> 00:08:48,780
that you're gonna make a game in half the time.

240
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,601
It's probably more like three times.

241
00:08:51,642 --> 00:08:54,063
Working on something a lot gives you a lot of deep focus

242
00:08:54,163 --> 00:08:55,884
and allows you to involve in deep collaboration

243
00:08:55,904 --> 00:08:57,285
which really improves your productivity.

244
00:08:57,606 --> 00:09:00,007
If you're like switching between different games

245
00:09:00,047 --> 00:09:01,648
like clients games and your games,

246
00:09:01,928 --> 00:09:03,109
you're not gonna be as effective.

247
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:05,070
If you have a timeline that says it's gonna come out

248
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:06,851
in a year, it's actually gonna be three.

249
00:09:08,267 --> 00:09:10,227
Now, fair beans, I stole that from Gwen Frey's talk.

250
00:09:10,428 --> 00:09:11,008
It's really good.

251
00:09:12,108 --> 00:09:13,689
Three steps for finding a successful indie studio.

252
00:09:13,709 --> 00:09:15,150
If you like what I'm saying, watch that one, too.

253
00:09:17,211 --> 00:09:20,292
Now, to do this work, and this is pretty obvious

254
00:09:20,332 --> 00:09:22,133
in any dev land, but you want to have people

255
00:09:22,153 --> 00:09:22,993
who can wear a lot of hats.

256
00:09:23,314 --> 00:09:25,114
Like, just because someone can do a bunch of things

257
00:09:25,154 --> 00:09:27,395
on your game, you might need them to do stuff for clients

258
00:09:27,415 --> 00:09:28,776
that have nothing to do with your game.

259
00:09:29,076 --> 00:09:30,717
Maybe they have a graphic design acubent.

260
00:09:30,997 --> 00:09:32,898
Maybe they have 2D animation skills,

261
00:09:32,918 --> 00:09:33,999
but you're making a 3D game.

262
00:09:34,219 --> 00:09:35,939
You're going to people who can wear a ton of hats

263
00:09:35,979 --> 00:09:36,500
to make this work.

264
00:09:38,702 --> 00:09:41,864
And last but not least, protect your team from sales thrash.

265
00:09:42,065 --> 00:09:43,426
It's gonna be really tough, you're gonna be out there

266
00:09:43,466 --> 00:09:44,927
trying to get new contracts.

267
00:09:45,408 --> 00:09:47,129
Don't expose your team to all of this.

268
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,751
You're already stressed out about it,

269
00:09:49,011 --> 00:09:51,573
you don't need your 3D modeler panicking

270
00:09:51,593 --> 00:09:52,914
about whether or not you got that contract.

271
00:09:53,235 --> 00:09:55,136
Be somewhat transparent so they understand

272
00:09:55,176 --> 00:09:57,979
the health of the studio, but every single potential client

273
00:09:58,059 --> 00:09:59,840
doesn't need to be your employee's problems.

274
00:10:00,561 --> 00:10:03,744
Anyway, I'm running out of time, and I hope this was brief but helpful.

275
00:10:04,185 --> 00:10:07,047
And it was really tough for us to do this, and I'm sure it's going to be tough for you.

276
00:10:07,388 --> 00:10:10,891
So if you want any help, reach out to me on Twitter or talk to me after the talk.

277
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,574
I'd love to get a little bit more in the weeds on this, I just don't have the time.

278
00:10:14,034 --> 00:10:14,515
Thank you so much.

279
00:10:14,535 --> 00:10:23,243
All right.

280
00:10:24,493 --> 00:10:31,928
I'm Teresa Derringer and I'm going to speak a little bit more towards the specifics of how to run a studio without a surprise hit

281
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:34,413
using hardware and IP partnerships.

282
00:10:37,234 --> 00:10:40,377
So we've all heard about indie mega hit darlings,

283
00:10:40,937 --> 00:10:44,620
the hotline Miamis, Fezzes, Bastions, and Braids,

284
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,722
but I would venture that at least some of the people

285
00:10:47,782 --> 00:10:50,425
in this room are not working on the top five

286
00:10:50,465 --> 00:10:51,405
grossing indie games.

287
00:10:52,246 --> 00:10:54,868
However unflattering it is to address this subject,

288
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,449
it's worth being honest about.

289
00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:01,273
The truth is that most indie games are not household names,

290
00:11:02,394 --> 00:11:02,894
mine included.

291
00:11:04,544 --> 00:11:10,670
So while it's really obvious what to do if you have a total hit, which is keep at it, awesome,

292
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:14,774
or if you have a total flop, you know, maybe do something else,

293
00:11:15,414 --> 00:11:20,619
there's a question of what do you do if your game is somewhere in between?

294
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,943
And it's a really tough question, it's kind of embarrassing to ask,

295
00:11:25,804 --> 00:11:28,366
and it's a question I've had to ask myself.

296
00:11:29,446 --> 00:11:31,267
With my first indie game, Cannon Brawl,

297
00:11:31,767 --> 00:11:34,928
it made about $400,000 in sales and about $130,000

298
00:11:35,348 --> 00:11:37,269
in contest winnings.

299
00:11:38,009 --> 00:11:41,250
It took two people three years to make, minus Steam's cut.

300
00:11:41,731 --> 00:11:44,692
It was about $70,000 per person per year.

301
00:11:46,152 --> 00:11:49,073
It's not nothing, but it's certainly not

302
00:11:49,113 --> 00:11:49,974
time to buy a yacht.

303
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:54,295
So where do you go from here if your game is kind of like

304
00:11:54,515 --> 00:11:55,656
somewhere in between?

305
00:11:56,881 --> 00:12:02,645
After a big launch, it can be really tough to get going on the next thing or even know what that next thing is.

306
00:12:03,126 --> 00:12:06,428
But that's the most important thing for you to be doing right at that moment.

307
00:12:07,028 --> 00:12:08,609
So you just have to pick a direction.

308
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:12,812
And for me, with Cannon Brawl, we got started because it had won a contest.

309
00:12:13,913 --> 00:12:17,375
So we found another contest and that was the Oculus VR Jam.

310
00:12:17,955 --> 00:12:21,057
And don't worry, this talk is not going to be about contests.

311
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:24,519
But it can be helpful to identify one thing,

312
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:29,922
which is who has too much money and not enough video games?

313
00:12:33,224 --> 00:12:34,065
Well, not VC.

314
00:12:36,661 --> 00:12:39,524
For a lot of economic reasons, I can't get into a 10-minute talk.

315
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:43,508
Funding is not usually available to small, creative studios like ours.

316
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:45,550
Usually.

317
00:12:46,091 --> 00:12:50,035
But there is an exception, and that is with speculative hardware.

318
00:12:50,575 --> 00:12:54,399
So we saw with VR, there was a burst of new funding in the scene,

319
00:12:54,479 --> 00:12:58,463
but we've seen it before with other kinds of hardware, like the PS Vita and OUYA.

320
00:12:59,284 --> 00:13:03,326
And our team's been pretty bullish about this speculative hardware we've developed for Gear,

321
00:13:03,566 --> 00:13:10,690
Vive, Rift, Tango, Starbreeze, even Ciftio. And while it can be really fulfilling to develop for

322
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:15,752
this exciting new medium, and you're jumping into a community that's really lovely, you're all

323
00:13:15,792 --> 00:13:20,574
fingering it out together, and it feels like you're laying the tracks for the future, I would say

324
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:26,537
there are some practical reasons to run away. The SDKs are changing out from under you.

325
00:13:27,177 --> 00:13:28,118
There are no standards.

326
00:13:28,904 --> 00:13:31,705
But more importantly, there are no users.

327
00:13:32,746 --> 00:13:36,367
So to give you a sense of my first game in VR,

328
00:13:36,427 --> 00:13:37,328
this was called Bazaar.

329
00:13:38,028 --> 00:13:42,830
And it made $6,000 total on Steam, at least.

330
00:13:43,631 --> 00:13:44,751
That's gross revenue.

331
00:13:45,451 --> 00:13:47,512
Gross being the operative word there.

332
00:13:48,713 --> 00:13:51,374
So without money, at this point, I

333
00:13:51,394 --> 00:13:55,316
would say never develop for speculative hardware,

334
00:13:56,556 --> 00:13:57,957
except if there's money.

335
00:13:58,698 --> 00:14:03,159
So if you have a new platform coming on the market,

336
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,819
especially one in an arms race between hardware manufacturers

337
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,220
or platform interests where they're pouring money into it

338
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,641
and they need content to show off the product,

339
00:14:14,841 --> 00:14:18,142
there is going to be some VC funding for games content.

340
00:14:18,222 --> 00:14:19,482
That's going to make it look good.

341
00:14:20,122 --> 00:14:22,463
You're also going to see grants that are coming directly

342
00:14:22,503 --> 00:14:24,543
from the platform stakeholders themselves,

343
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:26,143
like we've seen with the Oculus VR.

344
00:14:26,624 --> 00:14:29,066
research grant for $250,000 recently.

345
00:14:30,288 --> 00:14:33,391
In addition to that, you're gonna see other companies

346
00:14:33,692 --> 00:14:35,594
that wanna expand their brands

347
00:14:35,734 --> 00:14:38,076
into this new platform space, the new hotness.

348
00:14:38,116 --> 00:14:41,941
So we saw airlines, TV shows approaching our company

349
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:44,403
to see if we could help them with that.

350
00:14:45,164 --> 00:14:51,210
So if you've taken the risk of becoming an expert on a piece of hardware where there are relatively

351
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:58,077
few users, so relatively few developers, you're putting your name in a kind of small hat for

352
00:14:58,117 --> 00:15:04,242
winning contracting bids. Bazaar had absolutely abysmal sales, but it put us on the map as a

353
00:15:04,343 --> 00:15:06,705
studio capable of VR development.

354
00:15:07,345 --> 00:15:12,569
And that's how we were able to get the funding to make Race for the Galaxy in VR from Oculus,

355
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:19,334
or to do the TAMP with Discovery Channel and do the app for their content on Rift and Gear.

356
00:15:20,762 --> 00:15:23,144
Now you can't always know if that cat is going to,

357
00:15:23,244 --> 00:15:25,486
the hat, not the cat, is going to exist.

358
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:27,527
You can take some educated guesses

359
00:15:27,587 --> 00:15:30,250
and look and see who's pouring money into the platforms.

360
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:33,452
But I'd say the biggest way to mitigate your risk here

361
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:35,994
is to keep your projects to six months and less.

362
00:15:36,554 --> 00:15:39,196
That way if the hat never shows up, you didn't risk it all.

363
00:15:40,537 --> 00:15:42,479
So never develop for a speculative platform,

364
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:45,882
except if there's money, and also, except if there's IP.

365
00:15:46,917 --> 00:15:51,503
So there's a common catch 22 if you're a studio interested in getting involved with IP work

366
00:15:52,043 --> 00:15:58,271
is that nobody wants to risk their evergreen IP on an unknown developer. So it can be really

367
00:15:58,331 --> 00:16:03,056
hard to get that first one going. But if you can approach an IP holder

368
00:16:03,477 --> 00:16:06,360
With a platform that they're not getting their door knocked down on,

369
00:16:06,601 --> 00:16:07,962
there's not as many competitors,

370
00:16:08,423 --> 00:16:11,266
you can get your foot in the door and build a relationship with them.

371
00:16:11,807 --> 00:16:15,271
And that's how we've gotten some really top-tier board game IPs at our company.

372
00:16:15,711 --> 00:16:16,993
This is how we got Ascension.

373
00:16:17,053 --> 00:16:18,154
They've already got a phone app,

374
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:22,099
but we were able to approach them with a VR app and get that going.

375
00:16:23,307 --> 00:16:26,130
And once you have one IP, you can really

376
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:29,853
use this to swing from one to the next and the next,

377
00:16:30,353 --> 00:16:32,355
especially for us with board games,

378
00:16:33,195 --> 00:16:36,138
because many designers have designed more than one game.

379
00:16:36,678 --> 00:16:38,500
Publishers have published more than one game.

380
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,161
So it really helps your flow.

381
00:16:40,802 --> 00:16:42,343
So we started with Ascension VR.

382
00:16:42,563 --> 00:16:45,225
Then we made Race for the Galaxy, Roll for the Galaxy.

383
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,367
And now we're on Shards of Infinity,

384
00:16:47,587 --> 00:16:49,789
which is in beta this week, if anyone wants to give feedback

385
00:16:49,849 --> 00:16:50,089
on that.

386
00:16:51,442 --> 00:16:53,743
And these are all board games on the phone.

387
00:16:54,064 --> 00:16:56,005
They all share the same set of features.

388
00:16:56,045 --> 00:16:57,445
They're all in the same genre.

389
00:16:57,485 --> 00:17:00,827
So board games have a really interesting property,

390
00:17:01,207 --> 00:17:03,148
which is that they come with expansion packs.

391
00:17:03,808 --> 00:17:06,309
And these are these delightful little chunks of work

392
00:17:06,789 --> 00:17:08,770
that are super flexible on your schedule,

393
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:11,171
and they have a really predictable return.

394
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:14,073
We find 15% of our sales, our base game sales,

395
00:17:14,413 --> 00:17:16,814
will reap back with our expansions.

396
00:17:18,225 --> 00:17:22,254
Your superpower as an indie studio is you are a unit,

397
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:25,682
a team of people who work really well together,

398
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,027
especially on small projects.

399
00:17:29,008 --> 00:17:35,433
So you can get a project done faster than a PM at a AAA company can even get the sign-off

400
00:17:35,693 --> 00:17:37,855
on the headcount to do similar work.

401
00:17:38,215 --> 00:17:39,196
So leverage that.

402
00:17:39,956 --> 00:17:43,439
Move around your projects on your schedule so that if someone comes to you and they have

403
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:47,182
something that needs to get done yesterday, you just drop it and drop what you're doing

404
00:17:47,222 --> 00:17:48,783
and you say, yes, we can do that.

405
00:17:49,123 --> 00:17:51,045
And that's what expansions are really good for that.

406
00:17:52,225 --> 00:17:55,108
But any small chunks of work will work for that.

407
00:17:56,092 --> 00:17:58,354
Also, if funding gets delayed for a project,

408
00:17:58,655 --> 00:18:00,796
then you can move those expansions up in your schedule.

409
00:18:01,797 --> 00:18:06,221
So once you've found a genre, it's helpful to stick to it.

410
00:18:06,301 --> 00:18:07,682
You can line up your next projects.

411
00:18:07,702 --> 00:18:10,545
You can see once we started doing board game stuff

412
00:18:10,705 --> 00:18:12,707
on the right, we started getting more and more projects

413
00:18:12,747 --> 00:18:14,468
just flowing from one to the next.

414
00:18:14,548 --> 00:18:16,310
The pink ones are the projects our studio has done.

415
00:18:17,622 --> 00:18:19,303
Also, if you stick to a genre, you're

416
00:18:19,324 --> 00:18:21,906
going to get a lot more return on investment for your tools.

417
00:18:22,467 --> 00:18:24,029
So doing board game type of tools,

418
00:18:24,089 --> 00:18:25,851
we have a lot of UI tools where we

419
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:31,016
can do a lot of transparency icons and careful attention

420
00:18:31,056 --> 00:18:33,119
to draw order in 3D space.

421
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:34,760
You're going to get more value out

422
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,903
of that in your second, your third, and fourth title.

423
00:18:38,355 --> 00:18:44,018
So you also, again, want to think about who has too much money and not enough video games.

424
00:18:44,378 --> 00:18:45,399
Sometimes that's your players.

425
00:18:45,979 --> 00:18:51,542
There's a big mistake I made with Cannon Brawl, which is it didn't have an existing genre when it came out.

426
00:18:51,703 --> 00:18:54,964
There wasn't really a player base for a real-time artillery game.

427
00:18:55,485 --> 00:19:00,868
So we had to do the work of not only building the game, but building a community for this kind of work.

428
00:19:01,528 --> 00:19:02,869
Not the same thing with board games.

429
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:06,791
So you can just deliver something that the community is looking for, and it's a little easier.

430
00:19:07,835 --> 00:19:10,417
Here's a picture of where our money comes from as a studio.

431
00:19:10,877 --> 00:19:12,538
You can see we've moved from the longer project

432
00:19:12,578 --> 00:19:15,099
to the shorter ones that are about six months.

433
00:19:15,579 --> 00:19:18,000
And we make a lot of our money on direct sales,

434
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,141
but we still supplement that with grants,

435
00:19:20,462 --> 00:19:23,083
work for hire, partnerships, and contests.

436
00:19:24,384 --> 00:19:27,965
And Race for the Galaxy has been probably our top seller.

437
00:19:28,686 --> 00:19:31,027
It's one of the top card games on iOS,

438
00:19:31,067 --> 00:19:32,788
but we've also had plenty of failures.

439
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,643
The point of all this is that you as an indie studio

440
00:19:37,763 --> 00:19:39,465
can do what you want, whether that's

441
00:19:39,605 --> 00:19:41,146
working on a kooky piece of hardware

442
00:19:41,586 --> 00:19:43,328
or working on a kooky game idea.

443
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:47,411
But if you don't win the lottery with that,

444
00:19:48,332 --> 00:19:49,413
you're not out of the game.

445
00:19:49,573 --> 00:19:51,595
You just have to balance out your workload

446
00:19:51,835 --> 00:19:52,816
with some safer bets.

447
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:55,736
We have this idea of what it is to be indie,

448
00:19:56,677 --> 00:20:00,419
to sometimes create this beautiful, glorious magnum opus

449
00:20:00,459 --> 00:20:04,221
that takes seven years to produce, and that's very valid.

450
00:20:04,241 --> 00:20:06,422
This is another way to be indie.

451
00:20:06,482 --> 00:20:07,623
It's definitely not that.

452
00:20:07,683 --> 00:20:11,285
This is being nimble, it's reacting to opportunities,

453
00:20:11,665 --> 00:20:14,927
and staying alive to make those projects that you do love,

454
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:16,928
withstanding successes and failures.

455
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:30,866
Hello, I'm Tanya X. Short.

456
00:20:30,946 --> 00:20:32,528
I'm the captain of Kit Fox Games.

457
00:20:33,048 --> 00:20:34,890
And I'm here to present, I guess,

458
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:38,393
maybe a more traditional idea of what it is to be an indie

459
00:20:38,473 --> 00:20:41,075
in that we still haven't managed to pay ourselves $70,000 a year.

460
00:20:42,814 --> 00:20:46,755
That sounds great, but we are scrappily clawing our way up

461
00:20:47,175 --> 00:20:48,575
every year, increasing our salary

462
00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:51,476
through increasingly successful games, hopefully.

463
00:20:52,216 --> 00:20:54,997
You might know us most through Boyfriend Dungeon.

464
00:20:55,397 --> 00:20:57,637
We also last week announced we were

465
00:20:57,657 --> 00:21:00,958
going to pair with Bay 12 Games to publish Dwarf Fortress.

466
00:21:01,818 --> 00:21:04,038
And all of this does come back to a strategy

467
00:21:04,098 --> 00:21:06,199
that we settled on about five, six years ago.

468
00:21:07,219 --> 00:21:09,139
When we started, we weren't sure what we were doing.

469
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,180
We were just sort of working together

470
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:15,661
on trying to make a studio together that would survive,

471
00:21:15,701 --> 00:21:17,981
that we could become better designers together.

472
00:21:18,001 --> 00:21:21,602
Oh, the formatting's not great, but it's fine.

473
00:21:22,742 --> 00:21:24,683
We want to make some of the best games in the world,

474
00:21:24,743 --> 00:21:27,243
and in order to do that, we have to be happy,

475
00:21:27,263 --> 00:21:30,184
and in order to be happy and make better and better games,

476
00:21:30,204 --> 00:21:30,984
we have to survive.

477
00:21:31,344 --> 00:21:31,744
And so,

478
00:21:32,804 --> 00:21:36,125
When it all comes down to is every time we ship a game,

479
00:21:36,165 --> 00:21:38,465
we're already in the middle of thinking

480
00:21:38,525 --> 00:21:40,386
about what is the next one, and how do we

481
00:21:40,446 --> 00:21:42,606
help the next one be better than the last one?

482
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,947
Not just better in terms of, I don't know,

483
00:21:45,007 --> 00:21:46,967
review scores or sales or whatever,

484
00:21:47,007 --> 00:21:49,408
but better in terms of how we make them

485
00:21:49,468 --> 00:21:51,108
and how we feel proud of them.

486
00:21:51,789 --> 00:21:55,389
So overall, we have made a lot of choices that

487
00:21:56,790 --> 00:22:03,253
many would call maybe fiscally conservative, safer, less risky business practices.

488
00:22:04,593 --> 00:22:09,195
Now Kickstarter doesn't really fit into any of those goals in theory. In theory, you know,

489
00:22:09,235 --> 00:22:13,057
it obstructs your quality of life, it doesn't let you really practice your craft, and you can't

490
00:22:13,097 --> 00:22:19,940
sustain a studio on it, that's for sure. But this actually does fit into our underlying strategy

491
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:25,703
of being opportunistic and by always trying to control our own destiny.

492
00:22:26,243 --> 00:22:32,224
So what I mean by opportunistic is our very first game

493
00:22:32,244 --> 00:22:33,584
transition is a really good example.

494
00:22:33,684 --> 00:22:34,905
Our first game was Shattered Planet,

495
00:22:34,925 --> 00:22:37,125
and it was a mobile and PC game.

496
00:22:37,445 --> 00:22:40,406
And we were approaching beta, and the deadline

497
00:22:40,446 --> 00:22:41,306
was coming up fast.

498
00:22:41,606 --> 00:22:42,586
We were a bit behind.

499
00:22:42,886 --> 00:22:43,867
It would end up getting delayed.

500
00:22:44,747 --> 00:22:47,807
And our advisors who had helped fund

501
00:22:47,827 --> 00:22:50,568
that initial seed of the game were getting very nervous.

502
00:22:50,988 --> 00:22:53,429
But I heard about this cool new opportunity called

503
00:22:53,489 --> 00:22:54,809
the Square Enix Collective.

504
00:22:56,132 --> 00:22:57,513
And it was nothing at the time.

505
00:22:57,533 --> 00:22:59,874
It was just a press release on Gamasutra.

506
00:23:00,775 --> 00:23:04,197
But I cold emailed them, hey, can I pitch you something?

507
00:23:04,237 --> 00:23:06,218
And they said, yeah, if you send me a good pitch in the next 48

508
00:23:06,678 --> 00:23:07,139
hours.

509
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,581
So I actually set aside Shattered Planet.

510
00:23:10,861 --> 00:23:12,182
Our advisors are freaking out.

511
00:23:12,342 --> 00:23:13,023
What are you doing?

512
00:23:13,283 --> 00:23:14,263
You need to focus on beta.

513
00:23:15,004 --> 00:23:19,465
And instead I came up with the initial idea that would eventually become Moon Hunters.

514
00:23:20,346 --> 00:23:27,528
And the reason I did that was because I needed the team to know that I believed in them more than just the success of one game.

515
00:23:27,628 --> 00:23:31,390
That we were more than that. That we were multiple games. That we were going to survive.

516
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:35,251
And that we were going to have more beyond that no matter what happened to Shattered Planet.

517
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:38,473
There was going to be a continued Kit Fox.

518
00:23:39,433 --> 00:23:45,574
So this sort of bleeds into the fact that we are very opportunistic about figuring out how our

519
00:23:45,614 --> 00:23:50,115
next project is going to find funding and how it's going to help us survive even if it doesn't sell

520
00:23:50,155 --> 00:23:56,897
very well, ends up with us maximally diversified, which absolutely impacts our strengths and

521
00:23:56,917 --> 00:24:01,198
weaknesses as a studio. We're sort of maximally, like I said, we are maximally diversified. We've

522
00:24:01,218 --> 00:24:05,599
been around almost six years now and we've released three major projects. We've announced three more,

523
00:24:05,719 --> 00:24:09,020
two of which we're publishing, and we have another thing to announce actually.

524
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,821
You'll get a sneak preview of that at the experimental gameplay workshop on Friday,

525
00:24:14,041 --> 00:24:16,781
if you stick around, but please don't announce it.

526
00:24:16,801 --> 00:24:20,282
I don't know, it's supposed to be unannounced for another few months.

527
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:21,203
We'll see how that goes.

528
00:24:22,143 --> 00:24:28,044
But the point is that we are now having two games simultaneously, side by side, in production,

529
00:24:28,124 --> 00:24:33,005
our own IP for PC and console, despite the fact that none of our games have sold incredibly

530
00:24:33,025 --> 00:24:33,145
well.

531
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,661
But it's because we've diversified

532
00:24:35,901 --> 00:24:37,802
in terms of having the number of titles

533
00:24:38,022 --> 00:24:40,463
and the variety of titles that we actually

534
00:24:40,723 --> 00:24:43,005
started with a core, which we think of.

535
00:24:43,105 --> 00:24:44,465
We can think of it in a few different ways.

536
00:24:45,286 --> 00:24:46,866
Steam has been our core the whole time.

537
00:24:46,886 --> 00:24:50,448
But system-driven role-playing games

538
00:24:50,468 --> 00:24:52,549
is the core of what our audience expects from us.

539
00:24:52,649 --> 00:24:55,170
And so we think all of our games have something in common

540
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,611
that appeals in that way.

541
00:24:57,451 --> 00:25:03,420
So whether it's Dwarf Fortress or Moonhunters or Sword Boyfriends,

542
00:25:04,101 --> 00:25:10,209
you're still going to have a good time with one of our games if you're into system-driven role-playing experiences.

543
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:12,092
And by having that core...

544
00:25:12,813 --> 00:25:18,675
we can help move them from game to game more easily if our social media is all connected.

545
00:25:18,855 --> 00:25:25,878
So rather than having a Moon Hunters Twitter and a Boyfriend Dungeon Discord, we just have a

546
00:25:25,938 --> 00:25:30,480
Kitfox Twitter, we have a Kitfox Discord, and we have the wonderful Victoria Tran running that for

547
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:35,302
the last couple of years. It was driving me mad for the first four, and she does a way better job,

548
00:25:35,322 --> 00:25:36,642
so I'm really glad we have her.

549
00:25:37,182 --> 00:25:39,664
But the fact is that we've centralized it as a strategy,

550
00:25:39,744 --> 00:25:43,926
because even though random gamer number five doesn't really

551
00:25:43,986 --> 00:25:47,267
care about Kit Fox, there's no reason for them

552
00:25:47,307 --> 00:25:51,009
to care about my brand, they're more

553
00:25:51,069 --> 00:25:53,330
likely to move on with us to the next game

554
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:54,251
if they bond with us.

555
00:25:55,051 --> 00:26:00,357
as a brand, but also they get to know us as people. So rather than getting really attached

556
00:26:00,418 --> 00:26:05,924
to one game and one game's mechanics, which hopefully they also enjoy the game, they actually

557
00:26:05,984 --> 00:26:12,091
attach to us and want us to succeed with our next game. And we have seen that as possible between

558
00:26:12,452 --> 00:26:14,034
our Twitter and our Discord as they grow.

559
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:18,994
And all of that is possible because we've chosen to self-publish at every turn.

560
00:26:19,054 --> 00:26:24,035
And again, this is one of those, if you can get away with it, absolutely try to do it,

561
00:26:24,075 --> 00:26:29,977
because in the long term, we benefited so much from cutting our own salaries and doing

562
00:26:30,037 --> 00:26:32,138
our own publishing and learning our own marketing.

563
00:26:33,498 --> 00:26:36,080
All of our games can be found in one place on storefronts,

564
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,402
whether it's Steam or Itch or Nintendo,

565
00:26:38,842 --> 00:26:41,043
you can go look at Kit Fox and see our games

566
00:26:41,063 --> 00:26:43,045
and there's no other brands competing with us

567
00:26:43,125 --> 00:26:44,125
for that airspace.

568
00:26:44,225 --> 00:26:45,366
You know, Devolver isn't there,

569
00:26:45,406 --> 00:26:46,527
saying this is a Devolver game,

570
00:26:46,547 --> 00:26:47,808
which, you know, I respect them,

571
00:26:47,908 --> 00:26:49,949
but I'm glad that when you go there,

572
00:26:49,969 --> 00:26:50,870
there's no distractions,

573
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:52,931
that you can just see what are the Kit Fox games.

574
00:26:54,232 --> 00:26:56,673
And speaking of fans being able to find us

575
00:26:56,813 --> 00:26:58,714
and for us learning how to talk with them

576
00:26:58,754 --> 00:26:59,615
and bond with them,

577
00:26:59,635 --> 00:27:01,816
oh, no, that was incorrect.

578
00:27:02,938 --> 00:27:08,061
We also sort of identified this chain of helping them grow to engage more and more deeply with

579
00:27:08,101 --> 00:27:14,946
not just the game and the IP, but also just sort of bleed their own identity into being

580
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:16,247
bigger and bigger fans of us.

581
00:27:16,307 --> 00:27:18,488
And a lot of them come in at the purchase step, of course.

582
00:27:19,189 --> 00:27:24,552
But by helping figure out, like, how do we grow our fans to be super fans?

583
00:27:25,593 --> 00:27:31,096
We spent a lot of energy, for example, having PAX boosts, even though we don't on paper

584
00:27:31,156 --> 00:27:32,476
have any good reason for that.

585
00:27:33,097 --> 00:27:36,358
We feel very deeply that that is part of our success over time.

586
00:27:37,537 --> 00:27:40,478
So Kickstarter is part of that decision

587
00:27:40,598 --> 00:27:42,679
to try to make better and better games,

588
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:44,599
because it helps us centralize our fans.

589
00:27:44,659 --> 00:27:46,120
It helps us cement our brands.

590
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,900
And it helps us self-publish.

591
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,381
And so even though that money will never sustain us

592
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:53,922
in the long term, it does in the long term

593
00:27:54,022 --> 00:27:58,823
serve all of those corporate sustainability functions.

594
00:28:00,409 --> 00:28:04,431
I thought I would take a second to just actually be a little bit more transparent about our finances.

595
00:28:05,212 --> 00:28:07,273
Diversification, you can see it on the two charts.

596
00:28:07,293 --> 00:28:09,474
You have the development costs and the revenue of our games.

597
00:28:09,514 --> 00:28:11,215
They're never quite the same.

598
00:28:11,475 --> 00:28:16,158
There's a cancelled project in there that cost us money but actually maybe paid in some way,

599
00:28:16,198 --> 00:28:17,639
and I'll talk about that in a second.

600
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:22,463
Early on, our payroll was our primary cost, absolutely.

601
00:28:23,064 --> 00:28:26,607
But then the next year, so this is 2015, 2016,

602
00:28:27,227 --> 00:28:27,828
you can see there.

603
00:28:27,848 --> 00:28:30,310
And then the next year, because we had shipped

604
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:32,252
Moon Hunters and it did okay,

605
00:28:32,632 --> 00:28:34,654
we had to start paying back loans and royalties.

606
00:28:35,775 --> 00:28:40,056
This was all very complicated by the fact that we had income coming in from multiple titles as well,

607
00:28:40,136 --> 00:28:44,118
so trying to calculate what was actually going on with our bookkeeping was more complicated,

608
00:28:44,158 --> 00:28:49,320
but that's okay. Now, what I wanted to really note here was that we talk a lot about game sales,

609
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:56,742
and you probably got the hint from the people talking here previously, but that's the sexiest

610
00:28:56,802 --> 00:29:01,504
money, but it's not the real money that a lot of us live on. For our first million dollars,

611
00:29:01,624 --> 00:29:02,604
game sales were only 50% of that.

612
00:29:04,085 --> 00:29:09,991
We had Kickstarter, we had some, well, did I call them investments? Yeah, we had investments,

613
00:29:10,691 --> 00:29:15,916
and we had Kickstarter, and what is the, I can't even read, it's too small on my thing,

614
00:29:16,597 --> 00:29:20,020
and Work for Hire, right. Yeah, we did some contract work that was very exciting,

615
00:29:20,741 --> 00:29:25,365
and it helped us survive long enough to be able to use game sales as our primary motive.

616
00:29:25,466 --> 00:29:28,308
Even last year, we did some Work for Hire that I can tell you about later.

617
00:29:29,378 --> 00:29:32,079
So we haven't technically done all of these revenue sources,

618
00:29:32,139 --> 00:29:33,880
but it's not that much of an exaggeration.

619
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,061
We get our money from everywhere we can,

620
00:29:36,081 --> 00:29:38,621
and we stuff it into our bank vault.

621
00:29:38,821 --> 00:29:40,182
And then at the end of the year, we look and see

622
00:29:40,202 --> 00:29:42,063
if we can pay ourselves just a little bit more.

623
00:29:42,083 --> 00:29:45,064
And maybe someday we'll reach industry average.

624
00:29:45,084 --> 00:29:46,064
That'd be great.

625
00:29:47,424 --> 00:29:52,627
And just as a side note, we did talk to a few of the other studios in Montreal,

626
00:29:52,888 --> 00:29:55,749
and the top three, they did get their first million dollars from sales,

627
00:29:55,789 --> 00:29:56,890
but the bottom three did not.

628
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,491
One did very well on Kickstarter some years ago.

629
00:30:00,712 --> 00:30:02,853
One got most of theirs through government,

630
00:30:02,953 --> 00:30:07,276
which I'm not sure if that's a grant or a loan or what's going on with the government, but yeah.

631
00:30:07,336 --> 00:30:10,218
And then one had their first million dollars just straight from a publisher.

632
00:30:11,387 --> 00:30:12,828
The point is there's no one right way,

633
00:30:12,848 --> 00:30:15,229
but if you ask yourself what your goals are

634
00:30:15,289 --> 00:30:18,351
for yourself, not only as a studio, but as a creator,

635
00:30:18,812 --> 00:30:21,614
then you can see where your studio should be going

636
00:30:21,654 --> 00:30:22,875
from here and how to get there.

637
00:30:23,175 --> 00:30:24,916
But it matters what your goals are.

638
00:30:25,897 --> 00:30:27,338
Different studios have different methods,

639
00:30:27,498 --> 00:30:28,258
different constraints.

640
00:30:28,318 --> 00:30:30,200
There's never one right way to run a company,

641
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,581
and anyone who claims otherwise

642
00:30:31,661 --> 00:30:32,761
is trying to sell you something.

643
00:30:33,462 --> 00:30:33,742
Thank you.
