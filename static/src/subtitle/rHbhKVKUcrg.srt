1
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:07,391
Thank you.

2
00:00:09,293 --> 00:00:10,615
Can you guys hear me okay?

3
00:00:11,335 --> 00:00:12,217
Yeah, awesome.

4
00:00:12,377 --> 00:00:12,597
Okay.

5
00:00:13,698 --> 00:00:15,641
I want to start just by saying thank you for coming to the talk.

6
00:00:16,221 --> 00:00:21,207
It's an incredible honor to be sharing our writing process on Life is Strange Before

7
00:00:21,227 --> 00:00:23,770
the Storm at GDC, and I'm really excited to be here.

8
00:00:24,931 --> 00:00:26,854
Okay, so productive dissension.

9
00:00:27,791 --> 00:00:31,154
How a diverse writer's room created Life is Strange, Before the Storm.

10
00:00:31,174 --> 00:00:37,038
This is going to be a post-mortem of our process integrating narrative design and writing using

11
00:00:37,058 --> 00:00:43,083
a kind of TV model of a collaborative writer's room and crafting our 1500-page script for

12
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:43,744
Before the Storm.

13
00:00:44,965 --> 00:00:45,125
Yeah.

14
00:00:46,266 --> 00:00:47,567
Oh, just kidding.

15
00:00:53,652 --> 00:00:54,312
That looks better.

16
00:00:54,332 --> 00:00:56,054
Okay.

17
00:00:56,114 --> 00:00:56,194
Okay.

18
00:00:56,214 --> 00:00:56,294
Okay.

19
00:00:57,905 --> 00:01:02,827
Introduction. My name is Zach Aris. I'm a writer, game designer, narrative consultant.

20
00:01:02,847 --> 00:01:07,489
I've been working in the industry on and off for about 18 years. I got my first job in

21
00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:13,712
publisher-side QA for Electronic Arts. I worked on a game called Majestic. I'm just curious,

22
00:01:13,732 --> 00:01:18,754
does anyone in the room remember Majestic? I see a couple hands. Yeah. It was kind of

23
00:01:18,774 --> 00:01:22,675
an intermedia storytelling game. The logline was, It Plays You.

24
00:01:26,488 --> 00:01:29,470
My last project, I was a lead writer on Life is Strange Before the Storm.

25
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,031
I led a team of four writers in the production of the script.

26
00:01:33,232 --> 00:01:36,974
For those of you who might not know, I can't believe I can say this,

27
00:01:37,054 --> 00:01:39,595
Before the Storm is now a BAFTA-nominated prequel

28
00:01:39,995 --> 00:01:41,936
to the BAFTA-winning Life is Strange that came out in 2015.

29
00:01:41,996 --> 00:01:42,216
Thank you.

30
00:01:42,296 --> 00:01:42,877
It's crazy.

31
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:54,733
Before working on Life is Strange, I was on a show called Criminal Minds Beyond Borders,

32
00:01:54,813 --> 00:01:56,574
a primetime crime procedural.

33
00:01:57,955 --> 00:02:00,877
Before that, I was a narrative designer on Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning.

34
00:02:00,917 --> 00:02:02,879
How many people played Reckoning are familiar with it?

35
00:02:02,919 --> 00:02:03,699
That's awesome.

36
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,961
It was an open world combat RPG.

37
00:02:06,901 --> 00:02:10,804
Before writing and designing on Reckoning, I worked on two other open world RPGs that

38
00:02:10,824 --> 00:02:11,484
were never released.

39
00:02:11,885 --> 00:02:12,805
Welcome to game development.

40
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,882
At university I studied classics, ancient lit, ancient history,

41
00:02:19,363 --> 00:02:21,404
Latin, ancient Greek, and I published academic work

42
00:02:21,444 --> 00:02:23,085
that I guarantee you no one in this room has read.

43
00:02:25,907 --> 00:02:28,249
OK, a writer's room in its most reductive shape,

44
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,073
a whiteboard of some type where you can put information

45
00:02:33,413 --> 00:02:35,615
in a public space that everyone can look at and think about.

46
00:02:35,735 --> 00:02:37,576
You can use it to frame your conversation.

47
00:02:39,097 --> 00:02:41,359
A bunch of writers and a lead writer.

48
00:02:43,641 --> 00:02:44,841
Writer's room is kind of a weird thing.

49
00:02:46,321 --> 00:02:49,544
Writing is a very individualistic creative endeavor.

50
00:02:50,705 --> 00:02:53,648
And here we take a room and we bring a bunch of writers

51
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,509
who would be working on their own into a space

52
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:56,310
not even to write.

53
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,511
You don't even write in a writer's room.

54
00:02:57,531 --> 00:02:58,472
You just talk about writing.

55
00:02:58,512 --> 00:02:59,393
You talk about story.

56
00:03:02,576 --> 00:03:04,578
What do you produce with this process?

57
00:03:06,279 --> 00:03:07,660
We talk about something called the break.

58
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:10,123
At a really high level, it's an outline

59
00:03:10,763 --> 00:03:13,546
that seeks to explain the constituent beats of a story.

60
00:03:14,779 --> 00:03:17,601
So some character does something, another character feels a way about it.

61
00:03:18,501 --> 00:03:23,725
Maybe we have gameplay, narrative, pity, fear, a boss battle, catharsis,

62
00:03:24,626 --> 00:03:26,507
and that's a rough outline. That's really all you need.

63
00:03:27,188 --> 00:03:30,750
We'll spend hours, days, weeks, months creating a break

64
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:35,054
that writers can then take into their own writing practice

65
00:03:35,094 --> 00:03:38,196
to work on whatever element of the story that they're developing,

66
00:03:38,216 --> 00:03:39,837
whatever scene, whatever fragment of a scene.

67
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:44,456
Writers write their components individually, but we break together.

68
00:03:45,237 --> 00:03:49,840
We do that so that we frame a collective understanding that's sort of uniformly calibrated

69
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,120
around the vision of the story.

70
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:55,703
So even when John's writing the first scene and Felice is writing the last scene of an

71
00:03:55,743 --> 00:04:00,326
episode, they're doing so with a mind toward each other's work and the cohesive vision

72
00:04:00,386 --> 00:04:00,726
of the whole.

73
00:04:01,687 --> 00:04:04,088
The break might not be the only thing we're talking about in the room, though.

74
00:04:05,006 --> 00:04:07,867
We might spend a few hours just talking about a character like Chloe.

75
00:04:08,447 --> 00:04:09,928
What's her arc in this scene?

76
00:04:09,948 --> 00:04:11,129
What's her arc in this episode?

77
00:04:11,949 --> 00:04:15,831
What kinds of choices are we giving the player in how to perform Chloe as a character?

78
00:04:15,871 --> 00:04:20,232
And how do those different choices intersect with our story in productive or non-productive

79
00:04:20,252 --> 00:04:20,492
ways?

80
00:04:21,853 --> 00:04:24,054
We might spend a day talking about a theme, like grief.

81
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,603
An environment like Arcadia Bay, elements of our story like race and gender.

82
00:04:29,284 --> 00:04:32,927
And because we're also designers at Deck Nine, we talk about the gameplay mechanics we're

83
00:04:33,027 --> 00:04:37,091
using in developing the story as the player is seeing it through their eyes.

84
00:04:41,034 --> 00:04:41,434
Why do it?

85
00:04:43,957 --> 00:04:48,360
I'm going to admit that sometimes, and maybe even often, working in a writer's room is

86
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,601
frustrating and difficult.

87
00:04:50,935 --> 00:04:56,317
And the title of my talk, Productive Dissension, I think speaks to this idea that a healthy

88
00:04:56,377 --> 00:05:03,119
room is a room that has multiple voices and perspectives, but inherent in that is conflict.

89
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,581
You want to discuss ideas contentiously.

90
00:05:06,901 --> 00:05:11,262
You want to be critical of each other's perspectives, because at the end of the day, it's all about

91
00:05:11,282 --> 00:05:11,602
the work.

92
00:05:12,242 --> 00:05:13,943
It's about making the work as good as it can be.

93
00:05:14,223 --> 00:05:18,305
And a writer's room, despite all these difficulties that accompany it, can produce something really

94
00:05:18,345 --> 00:05:18,665
special.

95
00:05:20,308 --> 00:05:25,312
Having a plurality of voices will let you leverage the diversity of your team in a way

96
00:05:25,712 --> 00:05:28,854
that will protect your script and your story and your game from any one person's blind

97
00:05:28,874 --> 00:05:29,134
spots.

98
00:05:29,174 --> 00:05:30,795
I'm the lead writer on Before the Storm.

99
00:05:31,195 --> 00:05:35,338
I have never been a 16-year-old girl, but half my writing team has.

100
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:39,460
And when they have a voice and the construction of Chloe as a character, that's going to make

101
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,020
Chloe better.

102
00:05:42,882 --> 00:05:46,564
A room has the ability to produce high-quality content quickly enough to keep up with your

103
00:05:46,584 --> 00:05:48,986
production team, to feed the beast, as it were.

104
00:05:50,056 --> 00:05:53,018
Game schedules are excruciatingly difficult at times.

105
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:56,941
One writer will have a lot more difficulty composing content

106
00:05:56,961 --> 00:05:58,723
quickly enough on a narratively driven game

107
00:05:59,704 --> 00:06:01,445
to keep your content pipeline flowing.

108
00:06:01,745 --> 00:06:02,786
A team can do it fast.

109
00:06:04,787 --> 00:06:05,948
And to the quality of the work,

110
00:06:06,989 --> 00:06:08,430
a good room, a really healthy room,

111
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:10,892
can essentially Voltron a group of writers

112
00:06:10,932 --> 00:06:12,173
into becoming one super writer.

113
00:06:13,434 --> 00:06:14,975
If you don't know who Voltron is, it's this guy.

114
00:06:15,015 --> 00:06:17,137
He's basically a giant sword-wielding robot

115
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:18,658
composed of individual robot cats.

116
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:24,930
All right, so the crux of my talk, this is my argument.

117
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:27,691
I'm going to suggest that to build a really great room,

118
00:06:27,751 --> 00:06:28,572
you need three things.

119
00:06:30,412 --> 00:06:32,293
You need what I call an etiquette of exchange.

120
00:06:32,393 --> 00:06:34,434
You need a vocabulary and a methodology

121
00:06:34,474 --> 00:06:37,135
for talking about complex story work in a way

122
00:06:37,155 --> 00:06:39,756
that your team shares and understands

123
00:06:40,236 --> 00:06:41,797
and that can do the work in a room,

124
00:06:41,857 --> 00:06:44,297
that can have conversations in a room that

125
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:45,878
are different from the conversations you

126
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:46,718
have in other spaces.

127
00:06:49,115 --> 00:06:53,338
You need a culture of transparency, which is to say that every voice in the room can

128
00:06:53,398 --> 00:06:58,322
speak and will be heard, and every member of the room is deliberate in paying attention

129
00:06:58,442 --> 00:06:59,563
to their peers' perspectives.

130
00:07:01,164 --> 00:07:06,068
And if you have those first two, you also need a mechanism in place for actually making

131
00:07:06,108 --> 00:07:06,588
decisions.

132
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:10,431
It's pretty easy to spend a lot of time talking about story and accomplishing very little.

133
00:07:12,679 --> 00:07:14,700
Okay, so what do I mean by an etiquette of exchange?

134
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,202
Let's look at virtually any kind of room with people in it.

135
00:07:18,582 --> 00:07:22,023
Not a writer's room, just a space where people are near each other.

136
00:07:23,204 --> 00:07:30,147
They think about different things, like work, food, sex, fake news, Mario Odyssey.

137
00:07:30,347 --> 00:07:31,687
This is human nature.

138
00:07:32,568 --> 00:07:33,708
We're islands unto ourselves.

139
00:07:33,728 --> 00:07:35,969
We're little universes running around, colliding with each other

140
00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:37,690
in effective and ineffective ways.

141
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:45,553
A writer's room tries to suspend what's normal, tries to bridge those islands so that for

142
00:07:45,753 --> 00:07:51,136
a window of time we can all focus on one thing and every individual's talent and experience

143
00:07:51,296 --> 00:07:53,677
and skill set can be leveraged for that one thing.

144
00:07:55,998 --> 00:07:57,138
All right, so here's a writer's room.

145
00:07:57,359 --> 00:07:58,719
We have our lead writer in red.

146
00:07:58,739 --> 00:07:59,620
We have the whiteboard.

147
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,881
Guys, I want to talk about Voltron.

148
00:08:03,521 --> 00:08:04,302
Yeah, Voltron's cool.

149
00:08:04,342 --> 00:08:06,903
He's that sword-wielding robot composed of individual robot cats.

150
00:08:06,943 --> 00:08:07,583
I know about that guy.

151
00:08:09,575 --> 00:08:14,099
Voltron's awesome. He's a giant, he's got a giant sword, he's got cat feet.

152
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:19,965
Voltron sucks. I don't get it. Why would individual cats make a giant dude?

153
00:08:20,105 --> 00:08:22,927
Why wouldn't they make a giant cat? Why can't cats have swords?

154
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:28,192
No, no, you're missing the point. Voltron's a metaphor for what we're doing right now.

155
00:08:28,252 --> 00:08:32,256
It's incredible. Something that's stronger than the sum of its parts.

156
00:08:33,657 --> 00:08:34,438
I like Care Bears.

157
00:08:36,777 --> 00:08:39,159
So this is the writer's room in action.

158
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,561
And up until the Care Bear comment,

159
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:44,844
we saw a certain kind of etiquette of exchange at work.

160
00:08:47,847 --> 00:08:49,428
The lead writer's framing the discourse.

161
00:08:49,808 --> 00:08:51,850
Guys, today I want to solve the Voltron problem.

162
00:08:52,591 --> 00:08:53,431
We need to talk about it.

163
00:08:54,372 --> 00:08:56,574
And in that, the lead writer is seeking to curate

164
00:08:56,654 --> 00:09:00,398
a very specific discussion with a problem in mind.

165
00:09:00,418 --> 00:09:01,459
You want to go into the room

166
00:09:01,539 --> 00:09:03,200
with a problem that you want to solve.

167
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,071
And the lead writer is saying, OK, guys, this

168
00:09:06,091 --> 00:09:07,011
is what we're going to focus on.

169
00:09:07,752 --> 00:09:09,192
And each of the individual staff writers

170
00:09:09,332 --> 00:09:11,534
are striving to contribute to that solution.

171
00:09:12,254 --> 00:09:13,315
And I think for it to really work,

172
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,776
they need to curate what's coming out of their mouth

173
00:09:15,976 --> 00:09:16,637
as they speak.

174
00:09:18,478 --> 00:09:19,598
And then we have the Care Bear guy.

175
00:09:20,939 --> 00:09:22,460
It's probably one of the most common mistakes

176
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,941
I see junior writers make in a room.

177
00:09:24,973 --> 00:09:26,815
You're excited to be there, you've never done it before.

178
00:09:26,995 --> 00:09:29,637
You're surrounded by writers who are probably more experienced than you are.

179
00:09:29,657 --> 00:09:32,540
And the conversation that's happening is really exciting.

180
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,982
And at a certain point, you have a lightning bolt.

181
00:09:35,323 --> 00:09:36,364
And you're like, oh my God, Care Bears.

182
00:09:37,765 --> 00:09:39,927
I want to contribute. I want to say my Care Bear thing.

183
00:09:40,167 --> 00:09:43,710
And so you sit there for five minutes waiting for a lull in the conversation.

184
00:09:44,711 --> 00:09:46,733
And then people are quiet and you're like, Care Bears.

185
00:09:49,087 --> 00:09:50,488
And when I see it, I call it out.

186
00:09:50,508 --> 00:09:54,071
Because this is how you make junior writers more

187
00:09:54,111 --> 00:09:54,871
experienced writers.

188
00:09:55,472 --> 00:09:57,453
And I say, oh my god, Care Bears, really?

189
00:09:57,573 --> 00:09:59,454
You think we should stop talking about Voltron and

190
00:09:59,514 --> 00:10:00,615
start talking about Care Bears?

191
00:10:01,196 --> 00:10:01,696
Tell me why.

192
00:10:02,637 --> 00:10:05,779
And often it's like, oh, I don't know that we want to do

193
00:10:05,819 --> 00:10:07,500
that, I just thought Care Bears are cool and I wanted to

194
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,261
contribute something.

195
00:10:09,762 --> 00:10:11,283
This is the work of the lead writer in the room.

196
00:10:13,224 --> 00:10:14,785
It's having to decide whether to talk about

197
00:10:14,805 --> 00:10:15,706
Voltron or Care Bears.

198
00:10:16,998 --> 00:10:22,001
But in seriousness at all times, what you're doing with a team, a good team of writers,

199
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:28,464
they're full of imagination and they have ideally the experience and the talent to tackle

200
00:10:28,564 --> 00:10:29,665
any narrative problem you've got.

201
00:10:30,225 --> 00:10:33,567
And you light the fuse, you introduce the problem, and you let them go.

202
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:36,168
And you're courting a whirlwind of ideas.

203
00:10:36,908 --> 00:10:37,949
And a great lead writer...

204
00:10:38,588 --> 00:10:42,949
can navigate that whirlwind with a decisiveness, with an intention.

205
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:46,870
And what you have to constantly do as you're doing that is listen to what your writers

206
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:51,731
are saying and how they're contributing and developing, iterating on the idea, and clarify

207
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,011
and focus them as you go.

208
00:10:53,931 --> 00:10:59,892
It's really easy to talk a lot about something like Voltron or Care Bears or Chloe Price

209
00:11:00,152 --> 00:11:05,974
for hours and hours and walk out of the room at the end of the day with less clarity around

210
00:11:05,994 --> 00:11:08,094
the problem you were trying to solve than you had at the beginning.

211
00:11:09,719 --> 00:11:13,822
Having a structure in place that lets you discuss productively is key to this.

212
00:11:15,223 --> 00:11:18,426
The other part that's kind of inherent to this process is contention.

213
00:11:18,546 --> 00:11:21,729
We saw how heated that dialogue got around Voltron.

214
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:29,174
When we're talking about things like LGBT themes or grief, such a personal idea, or

215
00:11:29,214 --> 00:11:35,860
what it's like to be a teenager, I ask my writers to really invest their work in the

216
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,060
conversation with themselves.

217
00:11:37,957 --> 00:11:42,060
I want them to passionately talk about their perspective on the issue, and they're going

218
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,001
to disagree with each other.

219
00:11:43,921 --> 00:11:44,602
How do you do that?

220
00:11:44,702 --> 00:11:50,486
How do you have a dialogue in a group that can become so contentious around socially

221
00:11:50,506 --> 00:11:55,969
charged issues and make it fruitful, let alone pleasant to engage in?

222
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:58,211
So as an anecdote.

223
00:11:59,345 --> 00:12:01,807
When I joined the Criminal Minds team, I was hired by Erica Messer.

224
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:03,467
She's the showrunner for Criminal Minds.

225
00:12:03,527 --> 00:12:06,509
And she told me when she was interviewing me that she has one rule

226
00:12:07,389 --> 00:12:11,912
that she uses to sort of evaluate who she brings on board every staffing season.

227
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:15,614
From an assistant writer position all the way to an executive producer.

228
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:17,715
When she's building her rooms, she's got one rule.

229
00:12:19,856 --> 00:12:20,356
No assholes.

230
00:12:21,496 --> 00:12:23,417
That's kind of silly and funny, but it's really true.

231
00:12:23,838 --> 00:12:28,480
There's an alchemy to a healthy room that's able to passionately argue.

232
00:12:29,338 --> 00:12:33,321
drawing from their own personal experiences without making the argument about each other.

233
00:12:34,682 --> 00:12:37,484
And for me, it comes down to kindness and humility.

234
00:12:38,405 --> 00:12:40,186
And I hire writers with that in mind.

235
00:12:40,246 --> 00:12:44,809
It's really important because it keeps the conversation about the work.

236
00:12:45,309 --> 00:12:46,130
And that's what it should be.

237
00:12:47,471 --> 00:12:53,435
Ego and sensitivity, the kind of writer who hears criticism of an idea and really feels

238
00:12:53,455 --> 00:12:58,258
like it's criticism of them, they might not be the best kind of writer for a writer's

239
00:12:58,278 --> 00:12:58,478
room.

240
00:13:00,432 --> 00:13:02,773
Okay, so let me talk about my team for a second.

241
00:13:03,254 --> 00:13:05,195
The writers who wrote Life is Strange Before the Storm.

242
00:13:05,975 --> 00:13:07,456
John Zimmerman, he's 32 years old.

243
00:13:08,217 --> 00:13:09,938
He's a bachelor's from Brandeis in journalism

244
00:13:10,058 --> 00:13:10,758
and creative writing.

245
00:13:11,439 --> 00:13:13,420
He has an MFA from USC in film production,

246
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,221
one of the best film schools in the world.

247
00:13:16,522 --> 00:13:17,843
Prior to working on Before the Storm,

248
00:13:18,844 --> 00:13:21,786
he wrote and directed a bunch of his own indie projects.

249
00:13:22,987 --> 00:13:24,287
And this was what really caught my eye

250
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:25,248
when I was interviewing him.

251
00:13:25,848 --> 00:13:27,850
He taught interactive fiction

252
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:29,591
in enrichment programs for children.

253
00:13:31,075 --> 00:13:34,276
Felice Kwan, 34, Bachelor's from Princeton in Mathematics,

254
00:13:34,496 --> 00:13:36,857
MA from Harvard in Education, MFA from NYU

255
00:13:36,897 --> 00:13:38,117
in Musical Theater Composition.

256
00:13:38,157 --> 00:13:39,258
So she's obviously a dummy.

257
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:43,399
She taught SAT and ACT prep.

258
00:13:43,419 --> 00:13:44,400
She's tutored mathematics.

259
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,181
She's an extensive LARPer, and she loves

260
00:13:46,221 --> 00:13:47,861
to write and read YA fiction.

261
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:51,463
Mallory Littleton, she's 21.

262
00:13:51,783 --> 00:13:55,244
She's currently in school pursuing an associate's degree

263
00:13:55,824 --> 00:13:58,345
from Colorado Film School in film production

264
00:13:58,365 --> 00:13:59,966
with an emphasis in screenwriting.

265
00:14:01,459 --> 00:14:03,902
Mal has done everything you can do on a film set.

266
00:14:05,584 --> 00:14:08,388
She watches and plays everything she can, and she hates pretty much all of it.

267
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:14,635
I want to talk about really two things, point out two things related to my team.

268
00:14:15,977 --> 00:14:20,282
The first is that, particularly for John and Felice, prior to working on Before the Storm,

269
00:14:20,302 --> 00:14:20,903
they were teachers.

270
00:14:21,956 --> 00:14:25,857
And that was really important to me because education is a wonderful space where you learn

271
00:14:25,957 --> 00:14:32,458
how to break down complex ideas using simple language and you develop a sensitivity to

272
00:14:32,898 --> 00:14:35,819
your listener to discern whether or not they understand what you're saying.

273
00:14:37,299 --> 00:14:40,880
That was a whole toolkit they could bring out of the gate into the room that really

274
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,801
helped us develop the right kind of conversation.

275
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:48,108
The other thing that I want to point out

276
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:50,589
is that none of the writers on Before the Storm shipped a game

277
00:14:51,289 --> 00:14:52,270
prior to working on this one.

278
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,410
They're really an extraordinary group.

279
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,271
I couldn't be more proud of what they've done.

280
00:14:58,551 --> 00:14:59,412
OK, enough mushy stuff.

281
00:14:59,452 --> 00:15:01,992
So second element I've claimed is

282
00:15:02,032 --> 00:15:03,513
critical to building a really great room,

283
00:15:03,553 --> 00:15:04,693
a culture of transparency.

284
00:15:06,094 --> 00:15:08,714
What I'm talking about here is a recognition within the space

285
00:15:08,734 --> 00:15:10,415
that it's important that everybody has a voice

286
00:15:11,155 --> 00:15:12,295
and that everybody pays attention

287
00:15:12,956 --> 00:15:14,236
and listens to each other.

288
00:15:15,908 --> 00:15:17,310
This comes down to room stewardship.

289
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:20,492
This is not something that happens on its own.

290
00:15:21,233 --> 00:15:23,495
It's kind of counterintuitive, how to talk,

291
00:15:24,055 --> 00:15:25,777
how to productively dissent.

292
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,759
And it comes down to the lead writer's responsibility

293
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:29,440
in framing this.

294
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,382
Now, I think it goes without saying that a toxic lead writer

295
00:15:32,402 --> 00:15:35,565
will create a toxic room, but often challenges

296
00:15:35,605 --> 00:15:37,887
that rooms find, they don't come from the lead writer,

297
00:15:37,907 --> 00:15:39,148
they come from junior writers,

298
00:15:39,868 --> 00:15:42,050
because they don't know better, because this is hard.

299
00:15:44,495 --> 00:15:48,797
So I think it's the lead writer's responsibility to be highly critical of the behavior of their

300
00:15:48,837 --> 00:15:49,057
team.

301
00:15:50,057 --> 00:15:53,659
I was in a room once where I saw one writer roll their eyes at something another writer

302
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:53,899
said.

303
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:55,220
And it was a personal thing.

304
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:57,961
And I called them out on it immediately.

305
00:15:59,022 --> 00:16:01,823
Not cruelly, not wanting to be vindictive in any way.

306
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:08,082
but because it's really important that kindness and humility is actively present in the discourse,

307
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:11,984
especially when you're writing a game, like Life is Strange, that's really trying to tackle

308
00:16:12,985 --> 00:16:14,726
socially significant and personal issues.

309
00:16:15,786 --> 00:16:20,969
So I would encourage lead writers to really thoughtfully shape the culture of your room

310
00:16:21,309 --> 00:16:25,411
and how you're talking, how you're listening to each other, and be highly forgiving as you go.

311
00:16:25,831 --> 00:16:29,273
There's no shame in calling someone out on something they didn't know they shouldn't do.

312
00:16:31,883 --> 00:16:33,724
And as the lead writer, if you're driving the ship,

313
00:16:35,124 --> 00:16:38,685
you have to be really great at receiving criticism yourself.

314
00:16:39,886 --> 00:16:42,387
I demand from my writers that they challenge my ideas

315
00:16:42,427 --> 00:16:44,067
and my direction when they feel it's appropriate.

316
00:16:44,668 --> 00:16:46,568
That's why I want them in the room with me,

317
00:16:46,668 --> 00:16:49,750
so that they can help me work past my blind spots.

318
00:16:51,792 --> 00:16:53,873
So I have this mechanism I call the make your case rule.

319
00:16:54,633 --> 00:16:55,753
I'm the lead writer in my room.

320
00:16:55,913 --> 00:16:57,214
I'm driving the direction of the break.

321
00:16:57,234 --> 00:16:59,314
We're talking about Chloe and the junkyard,

322
00:16:59,374 --> 00:17:01,595
processing what just happened in her conversation with Rachel.

323
00:17:02,435 --> 00:17:03,595
I want to take one direction,

324
00:17:04,676 --> 00:17:06,236
and maybe John wants to take another.

325
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:07,877
I need him to say to me,

326
00:17:08,477 --> 00:17:09,857
Zach, you know, I hear what you're saying,

327
00:17:09,897 --> 00:17:11,137
but I think we really want Chloe

328
00:17:11,157 --> 00:17:12,998
to be in a lower register of emotion.

329
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:14,838
Don't you think that'll be stronger for the story?

330
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:18,376
And I'll ask him, OK, that's an interesting idea.

331
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:19,417
Tell me why that's better.

332
00:17:19,597 --> 00:17:20,638
Tell me what work that does.

333
00:17:21,398 --> 00:17:22,959
And it's this kind of covenant we have.

334
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,920
My commitment to him is that I'm going to listen to what

335
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:26,481
he has to say.

336
00:17:26,841 --> 00:17:28,682
And I'm going to critically evaluate the idea.

337
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,603
And then I'm going to make a decision.

338
00:17:32,724 --> 00:17:33,585
And we're going to move forward.

339
00:17:33,705 --> 00:17:37,166
And having heard him out, when I make my decision, he's

340
00:17:37,186 --> 00:17:37,787
going to back it up.

341
00:17:38,067 --> 00:17:39,868
And he's going to throw his weight behind it.

342
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:43,370
And that's how we maintain our compositional

343
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:44,150
velocity as a group.

344
00:17:46,076 --> 00:17:47,257
Which brings me to my last point.

345
00:17:49,178 --> 00:17:51,038
Like I said, it's really easy to spend a lot of time

346
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:54,240
talking about a story without producing actionable content,

347
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,441
let alone an intelligent plan

348
00:17:56,641 --> 00:17:57,902
for how to take the work of the room

349
00:17:58,422 --> 00:18:00,423
out into the actual writing of the script,

350
00:18:00,723 --> 00:18:03,005
and then from the script into actual content production.

351
00:18:03,965 --> 00:18:05,166
So you really do need a mechanism

352
00:18:05,226 --> 00:18:06,526
that holds your feet to the fire,

353
00:18:06,807 --> 00:18:08,788
that says, okay, the time for conversation is over.

354
00:18:09,308 --> 00:18:12,910
We need to draw some lines in the sand and make some calls.

355
00:18:16,218 --> 00:18:21,843
Okay, so in ancient Greece, there was this thing called the ostracon, which was basically

356
00:18:21,903 --> 00:18:22,843
a shard of pottery.

357
00:18:23,904 --> 00:18:28,588
And when a citizen offended his neighbors because he murdered someone or slept with

358
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:32,692
somebody he shouldn't have or tried to overthrow the government, the citizenry would gather

359
00:18:32,772 --> 00:18:37,896
and vote by taking these ostraca and writing angrily the name of the person they didn't

360
00:18:37,936 --> 00:18:38,437
like anymore.

361
00:18:39,225 --> 00:18:40,025
and casting it out.

362
00:18:40,626 --> 00:18:43,688
And if enough ostraca with your name on it were assembled,

363
00:18:44,869 --> 00:18:46,851
you would get exiled from the city for like 10 years.

364
00:18:47,011 --> 00:18:47,752
You'd have to move away.

365
00:18:48,112 --> 00:18:49,433
It's where we get the word ostracize.

366
00:18:50,334 --> 00:18:53,817
It's a prototypical form of democracy in action.

367
00:18:55,238 --> 00:18:57,580
That's one way you could make decisions in a writer's room.

368
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,100
Just kidding.

369
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,081
That's a terrible idea.

370
00:18:59,361 --> 00:19:00,662
Basically, it's the lead writer.

371
00:19:01,863 --> 00:19:02,964
But what I want to point out with this

372
00:19:02,984 --> 00:19:04,906
is it is not a democratic process.

373
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:11,724
Healthy rooms have a culture of transparency where everybody has a voice, but velocity

374
00:19:11,804 --> 00:19:12,764
is needed above all else.

375
00:19:12,824 --> 00:19:13,865
Production is king.

376
00:19:13,885 --> 00:19:15,225
You've got to hit your schedule.

377
00:19:15,546 --> 00:19:16,726
You've got a right to scope.

378
00:19:17,067 --> 00:19:19,168
The lead writer's responsibility is that.

379
00:19:19,668 --> 00:19:25,491
It's maintaining an awareness of your overall content pipeline and your need to make decisions

380
00:19:25,571 --> 00:19:25,791
when.

381
00:19:26,212 --> 00:19:30,554
When you're looking at a story as complex as something like Before the Storm or the

382
00:19:30,594 --> 00:19:32,375
script that's as long as the Bible.

383
00:19:33,654 --> 00:19:35,795
You've got to have somebody with a hand on the rudder

384
00:19:36,956 --> 00:19:37,776
making these calls.

385
00:19:38,457 --> 00:19:42,799
And so the way that we worked is I charge my team to be as

386
00:19:42,859 --> 00:19:44,540
creative and imaginative as possible.

387
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,202
I shape the conversation as we go, but I am making decisions

388
00:19:48,282 --> 00:19:49,282
as rapidly as I can.

389
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:51,483
Here's the thing.

390
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:52,384
You're going to be wrong.

391
00:19:53,004 --> 00:19:53,785
I was wrong lots.

392
00:19:54,825 --> 00:19:56,306
You're going to make the wrong call sometimes.

393
00:19:58,227 --> 00:19:59,988
You just want to be right most of the time.

394
00:20:00,068 --> 00:20:03,429
And you can't let waiting for certainty prevent you from

395
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:06,010
being able to make some kind of a call and move forward

396
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:06,590
with the story.

397
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:09,731
Don't let the idea of the great, the ideal of the great,

398
00:20:09,771 --> 00:20:10,611
be the enemy of the good.

399
00:20:12,371 --> 00:20:14,752
Honestly, if you get it right like 85% of the time, you're a

400
00:20:14,792 --> 00:20:15,252
rock star.

401
00:20:16,073 --> 00:20:18,673
And your script's going to come out really well.

402
00:20:20,834 --> 00:20:23,035
So I'm going to end with one thought.

403
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:26,685
Writing stories is hard.

404
00:20:27,846 --> 00:20:30,208
Writing interactive fiction is way harder.

405
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,813
Writing collaboratively is, I think, the hardest thing.

406
00:20:36,495 --> 00:20:40,779
But when you're in a room, as a lead writer or a staff writer, you're there because you

407
00:20:40,819 --> 00:20:41,500
love storytelling.

408
00:20:42,421 --> 00:20:43,622
You have a joy about it.

409
00:20:44,483 --> 00:20:47,786
That's the only way that we would put up with what this career is like.

410
00:20:49,563 --> 00:20:50,023
Remember that.

411
00:20:50,884 --> 00:20:51,465
Trust each other.

412
00:20:52,065 --> 00:20:52,726
Trust that joy.

413
00:20:53,407 --> 00:20:56,970
And whatever you end up producing will be spectacular.

414
00:20:58,512 --> 00:20:59,292
Thank you very much.

415
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:07,300
OK.

416
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,663
So I've got 10 minutes for questions if people want to ask.

417
00:21:13,337 --> 00:21:14,018
There are microphones.

418
00:21:14,418 --> 00:21:14,578
Yeah.

419
00:21:15,778 --> 00:21:16,359
Yeah.

420
00:21:16,399 --> 00:21:16,559
Hi.

421
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:22,382
Having worked both in a writer's room for television and for interactive fiction and

422
00:21:22,402 --> 00:21:26,564
games, what do you find are the similarities and what do you find are the greatest differences?

423
00:21:28,048 --> 00:21:29,649
That's a giant question.

424
00:21:29,949 --> 00:21:32,850
So yeah, looking at TV and games, what are working in a

425
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:33,570
writer's room for both?

426
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:34,210
What are similar?

427
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:34,870
What are different?

428
00:21:38,411 --> 00:21:40,251
Needing to write discursively.

429
00:21:40,691 --> 00:21:42,952
When you're writing in games, you have to write with a mind

430
00:21:43,432 --> 00:21:44,632
toward branching structures.

431
00:21:45,152 --> 00:21:47,453
Depending on the type of game, the rigor of those

432
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:48,313
structures will vary.

433
00:21:48,853 --> 00:21:50,854
But you have to remember that when you're writing for a

434
00:21:50,914 --> 00:21:52,654
show, you're presenting something

435
00:21:52,674 --> 00:21:53,714
your audience watches.

436
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:55,635
When you're writing for a game, you're presenting

437
00:21:55,695 --> 00:21:57,475
something your audience determines.

438
00:21:58,495 --> 00:22:01,856
They have agency in and in the way that you're writing it,

439
00:22:02,176 --> 00:22:03,557
you're sculpting that agency.

440
00:22:03,657 --> 00:22:07,198
So it's as if you have the player character in the room with you at all times

441
00:22:07,238 --> 00:22:11,099
and you're imagining how the different elements of the story options

442
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:14,059
that you're presenting will sort of influence them

443
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,040
and their experience of navigating that.

444
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,440
I honestly think it's the hardest thing about writing games

445
00:22:18,841 --> 00:22:20,101
and it's the thing that's most exciting

446
00:22:20,161 --> 00:22:22,221
because we have no idea what we're doing with this still.

447
00:22:22,782 --> 00:22:25,567
We're still figuring out what it means, honestly, to have

448
00:22:25,588 --> 00:22:28,934
the consumer of a story practice agency in the

449
00:22:28,974 --> 00:22:29,896
development of that story.

450
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,121
Thanks for the question.

451
00:22:34,051 --> 00:22:34,932
Yeah.

452
00:22:34,952 --> 00:22:34,992
Hi.

453
00:22:35,572 --> 00:22:37,534
Um, there we go.

454
00:22:37,554 --> 00:22:44,339
Uh, so I thought your, um, words on critiquing junior writers' like habits was very insightful.

455
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:57,270
I was wondering, uh, if you had any other observations that you found that, like, a junior writer did something very, like, well, uh, that might be applicable to other junior writers, uh, to learn from and improve.

456
00:22:57,902 --> 00:22:59,263
Yeah, that's an interesting question.

457
00:23:00,604 --> 00:23:02,567
Everyone can hear the questions from the mics, yeah?

458
00:23:03,267 --> 00:23:04,609
Okay, good, I'm going to repeat it.

459
00:23:06,391 --> 00:23:10,335
One thing I love about working with new writers is that they haven't become jaded or cynical

460
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:11,636
yet.

461
00:23:11,956 --> 00:23:15,580
And that's, it's funny, but it's honestly true.

462
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,724
And I think outside of that.

463
00:23:20,927 --> 00:23:23,107
You get into a writer's room, it's because you're excellent.

464
00:23:23,307 --> 00:23:25,528
You've done something really well to get to that place.

465
00:23:25,728 --> 00:23:29,529
But at the same time, your education is about to begin,

466
00:23:30,029 --> 00:23:30,409
for real.

467
00:23:31,269 --> 00:23:34,290
So I tell my junior writers, I want them to talk as much as

468
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:34,710
anyone else.

469
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:35,710
I want them to ask questions.

470
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:36,690
I want them to get involved.

471
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:40,071
I want them not to be afraid of failure, or looking stupid,

472
00:23:40,091 --> 00:23:40,691
or any of that.

473
00:23:41,131 --> 00:23:44,232
But it's that enthusiasm that they really have going for

474
00:23:44,252 --> 00:23:46,993
them that I find joyful to work with.

475
00:23:48,053 --> 00:23:49,073
Thank you for that question.

476
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:50,341
Yeah?

477
00:23:50,982 --> 00:23:51,482
Hi, thanks.

478
00:23:52,704 --> 00:23:58,934
I was wondering if you had any challenges working on the culture of, say, the writer's

479
00:23:58,994 --> 00:24:02,660
room versus the culture of the organization that you work for as a whole?

480
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:02,960
Is it...

481
00:24:04,035 --> 00:24:07,576
with their discrepancies between how you run a writer's room.

482
00:24:07,596 --> 00:24:10,538
Because I work at a company where we're trying to establish

483
00:24:10,578 --> 00:24:16,380
writers' rooms and just the idea, how do you merge the two

484
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,181
cultures, I guess?

485
00:24:18,281 --> 00:24:19,722
That's a really insightful question.

486
00:24:20,462 --> 00:24:23,403
I mean, it varies, obviously, from what kind of

487
00:24:23,443 --> 00:24:25,264
organization you're in and what kind of room you want to have.

488
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,843
At Deck Nine, the writing group is also the core design group.

489
00:24:31,384 --> 00:24:34,886
We have level designers who are much better at many kinds of design than we are, but we're

490
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:35,587
narrative designers.

491
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:38,549
We write code, we iterate on gameplay mechanics and things like that.

492
00:24:38,569 --> 00:24:42,511
And because of that, we are essentially the start of the content pipeline.

493
00:24:43,652 --> 00:24:46,714
So we have a really autonomous culture in that regard.

494
00:24:47,655 --> 00:24:51,377
I think, like many elements of software development, the most important...

495
00:24:52,227 --> 00:24:53,888
Path forward is the one that works.

496
00:24:54,608 --> 00:24:56,729
So I think maintaining an agility of thought about

497
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:59,531
what the writer's room needs for your needs,

498
00:24:59,671 --> 00:25:00,851
what kind of a culture it needs,

499
00:25:00,952 --> 00:25:03,533
maybe that's contrary to the organization as a whole,

500
00:25:03,853 --> 00:25:05,474
and maybe that's totally okay.

501
00:25:06,575 --> 00:25:08,396
At the end of the day, is the room being effective or not?

502
00:25:08,516 --> 00:25:09,797
I think that's the question you wanna ask,

503
00:25:09,857 --> 00:25:12,598
and if it's not, then be willing to re-imagine it, I think.

504
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:14,079
Thank you. Yeah.

505
00:25:15,548 --> 00:25:15,708
Hi.

506
00:25:15,968 --> 00:25:16,108
Hey.

507
00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:18,290
I have a bit of a brain teaser, I guess.

508
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:21,372
I teach game writing workshops with students.

509
00:25:21,832 --> 00:25:23,973
And my past policy was that everyone's even.

510
00:25:24,714 --> 00:25:27,235
And it's always the most painful part of the workshop

511
00:25:27,315 --> 00:25:29,637
to get these people to make a decision together

512
00:25:29,657 --> 00:25:30,558
when everyone's even.

513
00:25:31,578 --> 00:25:34,180
So would your suggestion be that maybe they vote for a

514
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,942
leader, or do you think it's possible for someone to create

515
00:25:36,982 --> 00:25:38,543
a story without a leader?

516
00:25:39,661 --> 00:25:40,782
That's a great question.

517
00:25:40,802 --> 00:25:45,443
I am a big fan of teaching the way the work actually happens.

518
00:25:46,163 --> 00:25:48,624
So I would definitely say elect a leader.

519
00:25:49,565 --> 00:25:51,305
Voting has its own challenges.

520
00:25:51,825 --> 00:25:54,226
Depending on the length of your class, the length of your

521
00:25:54,246 --> 00:25:57,127
semester, the segment of work, if it's a three-person team

522
00:25:57,447 --> 00:26:00,168
and you could do it, I would say have three pieces of work

523
00:26:00,228 --> 00:26:03,309
that they work on in three different phases and have each

524
00:26:03,409 --> 00:26:05,730
person take the helm.

525
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:08,051
And so everyone gets that experience.

526
00:26:08,532 --> 00:26:10,693
And that might be the most sort of equitable way to do it.

527
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:11,633
Great, thank you.

528
00:26:11,813 --> 00:26:12,034
Yeah.

529
00:26:13,595 --> 00:26:16,336
You had mentioned briefly that none of your writers

530
00:26:16,376 --> 00:26:18,457
had game experience before.

531
00:26:18,477 --> 00:26:21,899
And beyond just being teachers, do you have any other advice

532
00:26:21,939 --> 00:26:23,560
for what you look for, filter for,

533
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:27,583
when trying to make a speculative bet on a writer

534
00:26:27,603 --> 00:26:29,584
and whether they'll do well in this craft?

535
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:34,924
Yes, so I said kindness and humility, and I really do mean that.

536
00:26:35,064 --> 00:26:36,866
It sounds like kind of a trite thing, but it's not.

537
00:26:38,007 --> 00:26:44,754
I think I demonstrated awareness and vocabulary around how to talk about story, and that doesn't

538
00:26:44,794 --> 00:26:46,656
need to mean that you've published something.

539
00:26:47,861 --> 00:26:52,422
That could mean that you've collaborated with a group very unsuccessfully to write something

540
00:26:52,462 --> 00:26:54,782
that never got off the ground, but you learned something from it.

541
00:26:55,422 --> 00:26:59,843
If I'm interviewing someone and they're talking about that experience and I hear that, you

542
00:26:59,863 --> 00:27:04,344
know, in their language and how they talk about it, that they thought about what that

543
00:27:04,404 --> 00:27:09,265
was for them, that they're capable of sort of engaging that critical thought about those

544
00:27:09,305 --> 00:27:10,745
processes, that gets me excited.

545
00:27:10,845 --> 00:27:14,245
That makes me think, okay, this is someone who I can learn from, this is someone I can

546
00:27:14,285 --> 00:27:16,806
teach, and I'll give that person a closer look.

547
00:27:18,469 --> 00:27:19,910
That's the end. Thank you.

548
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:23,533
So I just want to say we have two minutes until I think I need to disappear.

549
00:27:24,313 --> 00:27:25,274
But I'm not going to disappear.

550
00:27:26,415 --> 00:27:30,018
Yeah, so I'm going to go down the hall to the wrap-up room.

551
00:27:30,499 --> 00:27:33,161
It's basically at the end on the left, and I'll be sitting at a table.

552
00:27:33,181 --> 00:27:36,383
And if anyone has any more questions and you want to just introduce yourselves,

553
00:27:36,443 --> 00:27:38,966
please come talk with me. I'll be there for about an hour.

554
00:27:39,606 --> 00:27:40,747
Thank you so much, everybody.
