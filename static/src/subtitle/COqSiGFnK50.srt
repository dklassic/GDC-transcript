1
00:00:05,999 --> 00:00:09,121
Thanks, everybody, for joining me today.

2
00:00:09,121 --> 00:00:10,501
My name is Matt Collins,

3
00:00:10,501 --> 00:00:12,222
and I'm the CG supervisor for Turn 10.

4
00:00:12,222 --> 00:00:16,744
This talk today is Art Directing for 100 Miles per Hour,

5
00:00:16,744 --> 00:00:19,506
and this is really talking about the unique challenges

6
00:00:19,506 --> 00:00:25,109
that we have art directing for a title that moves so quickly.

7
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:27,090
We don't have a lot of performance bandwidth

8
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,631
because we have to move at 100,

9
00:00:29,631 --> 00:00:31,492
sometimes even 200 miles an hour,

10
00:00:31,492 --> 00:00:34,553
so we have to be really focused on sort of the core art values

11
00:00:34,553 --> 00:00:35,794
and techniques.

12
00:00:36,838 --> 00:00:40,979
for how we manage our frame.

13
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:43,040
So a lot of the talk today is actually speaking

14
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,681
to the core art principles and core values of art,

15
00:00:46,681 --> 00:00:49,141
but because we don't have a lot of sort of bandwidth

16
00:00:49,141 --> 00:00:51,302
for fancy graphics effects and everything else,

17
00:00:51,302 --> 00:00:54,563
we really have to double down on art direction

18
00:00:54,563 --> 00:00:56,644
and those core techniques.

19
00:00:56,644 --> 00:00:59,204
So I'm gonna go ahead and start going through it.

20
00:00:59,204 --> 00:01:01,565
The first thing I'm gonna show you is a video,

21
00:01:01,565 --> 00:01:02,625
a trailer for our game.

22
00:01:02,987 --> 00:01:04,147
It might be a little choppy.

23
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,028
All the videos that we played today

24
00:01:06,028 --> 00:01:07,529
might be a little choppy.

25
00:01:07,529 --> 00:01:10,110
So just enjoy their visual excellence,

26
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,971
but know that they might stutter a little bit.

27
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:13,411
So we'll go ahead and fire that up.

28
00:01:13,411 --> 00:01:15,972
XBOX SOUND.

29
00:01:35,693 --> 00:01:38,735
La la la la la la

30
00:01:38,735 --> 00:01:44,960
Running down on the radio

31
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:51,505
My bulls, summer, summer bulls

32
00:01:51,505 --> 00:01:58,490
Summer bucks, yeah

33
00:01:58,490 --> 00:01:59,550
In full blood

34
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:02,252
Mr. Hattie

35
00:02:02,252 --> 00:02:04,174
La la la la la la

36
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:13,834
And I'm gonna love you like I love you

37
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:23,222
Like I love you

38
00:02:23,222 --> 00:02:28,446
La la la la la la

39
00:02:28,446 --> 00:02:30,908
Like I love you

40
00:02:30,908 --> 00:02:32,850
Like I love you

41
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:38,374
Like I love you

42
00:02:50,495 --> 00:02:54,358
That is our very pretty game, which I am very proud of.

43
00:02:54,358 --> 00:02:59,381
It came out a couple of years ago and we're doing even greater things now.

44
00:02:59,381 --> 00:03:01,523
So it's been a lot of fun to work on.

45
00:03:01,523 --> 00:03:05,226
So the overview today is going to be, we're going to do a brief history of Forza and talk

46
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:08,428
about the unique challenges that we have making a racing game.

47
00:03:08,923 --> 00:03:12,065
and how we prioritize visual investments for those challenges.

48
00:03:12,065 --> 00:03:14,307
That'll be the majority of the talk.

49
00:03:14,307 --> 00:03:16,008
I have a few slides in here.

50
00:03:16,008 --> 00:03:20,792
This was originally a GDC talk that talks about how we manage our performance budgets

51
00:03:20,792 --> 00:03:24,215
and how we manage our content budgets.

52
00:03:24,215 --> 00:03:27,217
And that might be less interesting to you guys, I'm not sure.

53
00:03:27,217 --> 00:03:29,179
So I'll go through it relatively quickly.

54
00:03:29,179 --> 00:03:32,541
But if there's things you want to ask me about or dive deeper on,

55
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:34,683
feel free to ask questions later in the talk.

56
00:03:35,266 --> 00:03:36,887
And then I'll talk about some of the pitfalls

57
00:03:36,887 --> 00:03:37,708
and key learnings,

58
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:39,530
because there's always key learnings

59
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,952
after you develop a title that we've had,

60
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:44,534
and then summarize the talk at the end.

61
00:03:44,534 --> 00:03:46,436
So let's jump right into it.

62
00:03:46,436 --> 00:03:49,178
Yeah, so my name is Matt Collins.

63
00:03:49,178 --> 00:03:52,841
I spent four years at Plymouth State University

64
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:54,123
studying illustration.

65
00:03:54,123 --> 00:03:55,824
I actually wanted to be a comic book artist,

66
00:03:55,824 --> 00:03:57,966
and right as I graduated,

67
00:03:57,966 --> 00:03:59,968
the comic book industry fell apart.

68
00:04:00,405 --> 00:04:03,608
And so I had to scramble and figure out what I was going to do after that.

69
00:04:03,608 --> 00:04:06,090
So I wound up going to DigiPen.

70
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:11,454
I spent two years at DigiPen and they gave me a very focused

71
00:04:11,454 --> 00:04:14,836
career or focused education around games.

72
00:04:14,836 --> 00:04:18,739
And then I wound up as an intern at Nintendo

73
00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:21,381
and eventually getting hired there full time.

74
00:04:21,381 --> 00:04:25,484
I was at Nintendo for three years working on Wave Race, 1080, Puzzle League.

75
00:04:25,988 --> 00:04:27,749
and eventually moved on to Microsoft,

76
00:04:27,749 --> 00:04:30,130
where I've been making Forza titles since Forza 1.

77
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:32,251
And I've been there ever since,

78
00:04:32,251 --> 00:04:34,471
and I'm now the CG supervisor at Turn 10.

79
00:04:34,471 --> 00:04:37,573
So yeah, just talking a little bit

80
00:04:37,573 --> 00:04:38,873
about the history of Forza.

81
00:04:39,667 --> 00:04:42,848
We've made seven titles in our main motorsport franchise.

82
00:04:42,848 --> 00:04:46,989
There's also four titles in our Horizon franchise,

83
00:04:46,989 --> 00:04:49,650
which is part of our sister studio playground.

84
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:51,490
They're over in the UK.

85
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:52,950
So we've also worked with them

86
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,471
to make a number of those titles.

87
00:04:54,471 --> 00:04:57,012
And we also have a mobile title, Forza Street.

88
00:04:57,012 --> 00:04:58,752
So a lot of years of Forza.

89
00:05:01,777 --> 00:05:04,717
So talking a bit about the challenges that we have,

90
00:05:04,717 --> 00:05:06,178
we run at 60 frames per second,

91
00:05:06,178 --> 00:05:07,898
which in itself is always a challenge.

92
00:05:07,898 --> 00:05:09,978
It just doesn't give you a lot of margin for error

93
00:05:09,978 --> 00:05:10,759
when you're rendering.

94
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:14,179
Our cars move at over 200 miles per hour in some cases,

95
00:05:14,179 --> 00:05:16,220
specifically the Bugatti Veyron,

96
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,680
which has been the bane of my existence

97
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,341
since that car came out.

98
00:05:19,341 --> 00:05:22,141
We have photorealistic visuals,

99
00:05:22,141 --> 00:05:24,022
which is a difficult target to hit.

100
00:05:24,022 --> 00:05:25,322
It's also kind of a plus,

101
00:05:25,322 --> 00:05:26,642
which I'll talk about in a minute.

102
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:29,600
We have long draw distances.

103
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,520
So in some cases, we can see up to three miles

104
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,681
from an area on the track from one end to the other.

105
00:05:35,681 --> 00:05:37,261
So that's difficult to manage.

106
00:05:37,261 --> 00:05:40,142
And most of our tracks are covered in vegetation.

107
00:05:40,142 --> 00:05:42,502
So this makes it difficult. That's hard.

108
00:05:42,502 --> 00:05:44,963
Vegetation is notoriously hard in performance.

109
00:05:44,963 --> 00:05:47,803
So that's a challenge that we often face.

110
00:05:47,803 --> 00:05:50,104
And also in terms of composition,

111
00:05:50,104 --> 00:05:52,544
our options are limited just because we are

112
00:05:52,544 --> 00:05:53,905
using real-world environments.

113
00:05:54,767 --> 00:06:03,330
So next I wanted to show you a video that sort of illustrates the main difference between our game and say something like a first person shooter like Halo.

114
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:12,093
So what you can see here is, if you look at the scene on the right that's our game and the Bugatti Veyron moving through our longest straight in the game on Le Mans.

115
00:06:12,093 --> 00:06:17,695
And you can just see how quickly you move through the scene, so this puts a lot of pressure on the system.

116
00:06:18,028 --> 00:06:21,131
Where on the left, if you have something like Halo, where

117
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:23,853
it's still, obviously, there's a lot of graphical beauty here.

118
00:06:23,853 --> 00:06:26,896
But you're moving through the scene at a different pace,

119
00:06:26,896 --> 00:06:29,618
which just creates different bottlenecks on the system.

120
00:06:29,618 --> 00:06:34,942
So oftentimes, when we're moving through the scene like this,

121
00:06:34,942 --> 00:06:37,044
we'll have problems where the textures drop out,

122
00:06:37,044 --> 00:06:39,166
the geo drops out, the whole world drops out.

123
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:42,549
The system just has a hard time keeping up with how quickly

124
00:06:42,549 --> 00:06:45,131
and how rapidly we're throwing geometry and textures at it.

125
00:06:45,592 --> 00:06:48,414
So it's always been a challenge for us.

126
00:06:48,414 --> 00:06:51,315
And so we, what that leaves us is not a lot of performance

127
00:06:51,315 --> 00:06:52,036
and I'll talk about that.

128
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:58,320
So the perks of making a racing game, it's not all bad.

129
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,941
It's a controlled experience.

130
00:06:59,941 --> 00:07:00,762
It's on rails.

131
00:07:00,762 --> 00:07:04,204
We generally know which direction that you're moving in.

132
00:07:04,204 --> 00:07:06,286
We can run some of our off-track modes

133
00:07:06,286 --> 00:07:08,627
at 30 miles per at 30 frames per second.

134
00:07:09,502 --> 00:07:14,645
And the fact that our cars move over 200 miles an hour is kind of a boon at times.

135
00:07:14,645 --> 00:07:21,848
It means that the user can't slow down and look at every minor detail and it means that we can

136
00:07:21,848 --> 00:07:26,831
spend more time on the overall frame and less on the individual quality of an asset because

137
00:07:26,831 --> 00:07:31,514
we know that person is moving very quickly through the scene. And also photorealism,

138
00:07:31,514 --> 00:07:35,796
the nice thing about it is that it's a clear style choice. We know what we're trying to hit.

139
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:37,627
It's not ambiguous.

140
00:07:37,627 --> 00:07:39,429
A lot of people have a frame of reference

141
00:07:39,429 --> 00:07:41,611
when we're outsourcing, so that's helpful to us.

142
00:07:41,611 --> 00:07:47,396
So how do we prioritize visual investments at speed?

143
00:07:47,396 --> 00:07:49,218
And like I said, this goes back

144
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:51,460
to a lot of the core art principles.

145
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,400
I like this quote here.

146
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,762
The first principle of the art

147
00:07:53,762 --> 00:07:55,303
is not to rely on tricks of technique.

148
00:07:55,303 --> 00:07:57,845
Most swordsmen make too much of technique,

149
00:07:57,845 --> 00:07:59,927
sometimes making it their chief concern.

150
00:08:00,338 --> 00:08:05,740
What we've seen is when you have the ability to use a lot of fancy graphics effects,

151
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:11,442
it allows you to sort of get more lax about some of the core art principles, art values.

152
00:08:11,442 --> 00:08:17,643
Because we can't rely on those effects, we almost are exclusively on core art principles and values.

153
00:08:17,643 --> 00:08:24,885
And so this provides us a razor focus, and we actually believe that because they're so core to art.

154
00:08:25,263 --> 00:08:28,625
that any game title or anyone that's making something,

155
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:30,746
if they pay attention to these core principles,

156
00:08:30,746 --> 00:08:32,668
it just makes their work better.

157
00:08:32,668 --> 00:08:34,009
And oftentimes we forget that.

158
00:08:34,009 --> 00:08:35,850
We see that with students.

159
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,951
We see that with professionals,

160
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:40,033
that the computer gets the better of them,

161
00:08:40,033 --> 00:08:43,275
and they rely too much on sort of the whiz bang stuff

162
00:08:43,275 --> 00:08:46,016
and not enough on those core fundamentals.

163
00:08:46,016 --> 00:08:48,758
So when I talk about the core fundamentals,

164
00:08:48,758 --> 00:08:51,500
which is mostly what I'll be talking about today,

165
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,201
this is what I mean.

166
00:08:52,201 --> 00:08:54,622
Talking about composition, value.

167
00:08:55,627 --> 00:09:02,471
palette, texture, shape, storytelling, cadence,

168
00:09:02,471 --> 00:09:03,712
and performance.

169
00:09:03,712 --> 00:09:05,553
And these are the topics that I'll be going over

170
00:09:05,553 --> 00:09:06,434
in further detail today.

171
00:09:06,434 --> 00:09:08,975
And something that you'll notice is what I tend to do

172
00:09:08,975 --> 00:09:11,196
is move from large to small.

173
00:09:11,196 --> 00:09:12,817
This is how you should build up anything,

174
00:09:12,817 --> 00:09:15,579
like a painting or any art piece, really.

175
00:09:16,005 --> 00:09:30,167
A lot of people will tend to get focused on texture too quickly without having settled these other core principles. And so as I go through this talk I'll kind of be moving through it from that big with big to small in mind.

176
00:09:30,167 --> 00:09:34,888
So, starting we'll talk about focusing on what matters.

177
00:09:34,888 --> 00:09:43,270
We spent a lot of time thinking about composition and I flow, just because we generally again you're on rails we generally know where, where you're looking at what you're looking at.

178
00:09:43,563 --> 00:09:48,404
However, early on in our titles, we weren't very good at this because a lot of us were

179
00:09:48,404 --> 00:09:52,705
used to working on first-person shooters or other titles, and we focused the majority

180
00:09:52,705 --> 00:09:55,466
of our attention around this area.

181
00:09:55,466 --> 00:10:00,387
So we put a lot of detail into our trackside objects, into our buildings, and what we found

182
00:10:00,387 --> 00:10:04,249
was it just didn't have a lot of bang for the buck.

183
00:10:04,249 --> 00:10:06,169
That just doesn't take much of the real estate.

184
00:10:07,478 --> 00:10:09,900
What we call it is the wedge, but this takes about 80%

185
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,902
of the real estate of the screen.

186
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:14,063
So it's critical that the read of this

187
00:10:14,063 --> 00:10:17,586
is the most important part of the whole scene.

188
00:10:17,586 --> 00:10:21,189
The sky, the road, getting that right, that's everything.

189
00:10:21,189 --> 00:10:23,471
And you can let a lot of this stuff go

190
00:10:23,471 --> 00:10:25,253
because we know that this is taking up

191
00:10:25,253 --> 00:10:26,714
so much real estate in our scene

192
00:10:26,714 --> 00:10:28,295
and is really what the player is looking at.

193
00:10:30,026 --> 00:10:31,727
We spent so much time thinking about this

194
00:10:31,727 --> 00:10:33,807
that what we did was we developed a system

195
00:10:33,807 --> 00:10:36,048
where if you're familiar with the rule of thirds

196
00:10:36,048 --> 00:10:38,189
where compositionally you split your frame

197
00:10:38,189 --> 00:10:41,811
into three parts, we did that here.

198
00:10:41,811 --> 00:10:44,392
And then we mapped out where the intersection points

199
00:10:44,392 --> 00:10:46,893
of those thirds were.

200
00:10:46,893 --> 00:10:48,753
And then we took it a step further.

201
00:10:48,753 --> 00:10:53,035
And what we found was that the focus of the viewer,

202
00:10:53,035 --> 00:10:54,796
the focus of the player tended to be

203
00:10:54,796 --> 00:10:56,917
in this sort of red diamond in the center.

204
00:10:57,461 --> 00:11:08,725
And we even backed this up with, we had Kinect eye tracking at the time, and we looked at a whole group of players to see where were they generally looking, and it tended to fall right in this area.

205
00:11:08,725 --> 00:11:15,167
So we know that when you're driving, this is the majority of where your focus is. So this caused us to prioritize our scene accordingly.

206
00:11:15,167 --> 00:11:22,869
Our P1, all the assets where we would spend the most amount of time, the most amount of polish, bug fix, would all happen within this area.

207
00:11:23,952 --> 00:11:25,313
This would be our P2 area.

208
00:11:25,313 --> 00:11:27,916
This would be the area that we would fix things,

209
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:29,657
but it would be less critical.

210
00:11:29,657 --> 00:11:31,459
And what we found with the P3 area

211
00:11:31,459 --> 00:11:33,801
was you could almost ignore it.

212
00:11:33,801 --> 00:11:36,923
I was amazed at the bugs that we would have in this area

213
00:11:36,923 --> 00:11:38,205
that seemed glaring to me

214
00:11:38,205 --> 00:11:40,026
because I was used to staring at the screen

215
00:11:40,026 --> 00:11:41,808
that people wouldn't see at all.

216
00:11:41,808 --> 00:11:45,151
Whole objects dropping out, the world missing.

217
00:11:45,151 --> 00:11:47,292
It's just, when you're focused on an area,

218
00:11:47,292 --> 00:11:49,534
it's very difficult to look anywhere else

219
00:11:49,534 --> 00:11:51,176
and people were just not looking out there.

220
00:11:51,623 --> 00:11:54,184
So it really just shows you how much composition matters

221
00:11:54,184 --> 00:11:59,207
and really not spreading your efforts out like peanut butter.

222
00:11:59,207 --> 00:12:00,948
So we use this tool so much that we actually

223
00:12:00,948 --> 00:12:03,129
created an in-game overlay that allowed you

224
00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:04,890
to see where you were looking.

225
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,411
And we would have this on screen at all times

226
00:12:07,411 --> 00:12:09,673
so that as we're driving around, we can really

227
00:12:09,673 --> 00:12:12,654
see where is the focus, where is the player looking,

228
00:12:12,654 --> 00:12:16,056
and where do we need to focus on polishing our assets.

229
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:24,882
The other thing that we noticed is that this focus did tend to shift depending on the context of the gameplay.

230
00:12:24,882 --> 00:12:28,882
So if you look at this area here, this is a user that's taking a difficult turn in the wet.

231
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:34,784
And so as they're turning, their focus changes from being out in front of them to right at this corner.

232
00:12:34,784 --> 00:12:38,544
You naturally start to look down at the corner that you're taking.

233
00:12:38,544 --> 00:12:42,625
Your focus and your attention goes to that because you're in a high intense gameplay moment.

234
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:46,026
This here is where you're straightening out.

235
00:12:46,252 --> 00:12:48,172
And what we found is then your focus shifts,

236
00:12:48,172 --> 00:12:50,053
it goes from being at the corner

237
00:12:50,053 --> 00:12:52,194
to up and out towards the horizon.

238
00:12:52,194 --> 00:12:53,655
So I'll talk about this later,

239
00:12:53,655 --> 00:12:56,376
but knowing that we tended to put our big moments

240
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:58,237
or our big areas of visual interest,

241
00:12:58,237 --> 00:13:00,758
in this case, having a really compelling sky

242
00:13:00,758 --> 00:13:01,758
out in front of you,

243
00:13:01,758 --> 00:13:04,019
because we know that's what you're looking at at that time.

244
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:08,821
So talking about the corner.

245
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:12,926
What we did is if we know that you're looking at the corner at a particular time,

246
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:17,028
that's where we'd spend a lot of our attention and focus and detail down on that corner.

247
00:13:17,028 --> 00:13:19,849
So then we would start to add things like storytelling elements, extra detail.

248
00:13:19,849 --> 00:13:22,551
We'd spend a lot of time and attention on that corner

249
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:25,212
because we know that's where your attention is.

250
00:13:25,212 --> 00:13:29,675
And knowing that really helps us prioritize as we're directing our content throughout

251
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:34,017
because we just don't have a lot of time to make content at the same level everywhere.

252
00:13:34,017 --> 00:13:37,599
So we really have to understand where the player is looking and focus our attention there.

253
00:13:39,296 --> 00:13:42,498
We like to think of this like a painting

254
00:13:42,498 --> 00:13:43,859
and how you would approach a painting.

255
00:13:43,859 --> 00:13:46,241
If you look at this, which I really love,

256
00:13:46,241 --> 00:13:48,303
this is a painting of a woman

257
00:13:48,303 --> 00:13:50,724
that from one of my favorite artists

258
00:13:50,724 --> 00:13:52,886
where all of the attention to detail

259
00:13:52,886 --> 00:13:53,807
is right around the face

260
00:13:53,807 --> 00:13:55,548
where your eye tends to focus anyway.

261
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:09,169
The core principles of value and saturation and all that and palette is still really good around the scene, but there's nowhere near as much detail, which you might not even notice at first, as soon as you get away from the face the detail just drops

262
00:14:09,169 --> 00:14:20,057
away, because the artist wants you to focus here. And what we found is if you actually put detail everywhere. It confuses the player, then are the keys of the viewer then they don't know where to look.

263
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:24,024
So composition and attention to detail really matters,

264
00:14:24,024 --> 00:14:26,887
and especially not putting the detail everywhere

265
00:14:26,887 --> 00:14:28,509
in the painting is really critical,

266
00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:31,352
and for us especially, because we're also limited in time

267
00:14:31,352 --> 00:14:32,914
and the amount we can spend on each asset.

268
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:37,920
So next I want to talk about the frame

269
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,622
and how we design for the frame.

270
00:14:40,943 --> 00:14:45,866
Because we're moving so quickly, the frame is really your impression of the scene.

271
00:14:45,866 --> 00:14:48,087
This is the part that we have to get photorealistic.

272
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:52,929
And one of the biggest tools that we have to getting photorealistic visuals is around value.

273
00:14:52,929 --> 00:14:56,471
This is also true if you looked at paintings as well.

274
00:14:56,471 --> 00:15:07,537
So much so to the point that we would actually do blurred grayscale thumbnails of our scene just to make sure that our values were reading OK and that nothing was standing out.

275
00:15:08,354 --> 00:15:12,818
To actually call out this scene in particular, we used to really struggle with this, where

276
00:15:12,818 --> 00:15:17,702
we would have areas like our guardrail, if I show you over here, or areas like our road

277
00:15:17,702 --> 00:15:21,585
lines being too white or not cohesive.

278
00:15:21,585 --> 00:15:23,726
And what that does is contrast draws your eye.

279
00:15:23,726 --> 00:15:28,470
And what we found is that people are actually looking at the road lines and looking at the

280
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,251
guardrails rather than looking at the car.

281
00:15:30,754 --> 00:15:34,475
And this created a non-cohesive scene,

282
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:37,916
and it created sort of a discordance with the viewer.

283
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,136
And so we really wanna make sure

284
00:15:39,136 --> 00:15:41,276
that we're balancing our values,

285
00:15:41,276 --> 00:15:43,317
make sure that they land in a photorealistic frame.

286
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:46,638
How we do that, if anyone isn't familiar with this,

287
00:15:46,638 --> 00:15:50,899
is with the concept of authoring our textures color correct.

288
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:52,619
So what we use, we have this thing called

289
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:53,499
a color checker here.

290
00:15:53,499 --> 00:15:55,620
These are industry standard values.

291
00:15:56,037 --> 00:16:01,339
And what we'll do is we'll take a picture of something for a texture reference, and then we'll bring it into Photoshop.

292
00:16:01,339 --> 00:16:05,601
What happens when you take a picture of something in the real world is that it's colored by light.

293
00:16:05,601 --> 00:16:11,003
You can see that these are two very different scenes. One is in the overcast, one is on a bright sunny day.

294
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:19,967
And what we're trying to do is we're trying to remove all of that light information, all of that color information, and get down to what is the base value for that color.

295
00:16:20,402 --> 00:16:22,862
And so we'll bring our textures into Photoshop

296
00:16:22,862 --> 00:16:25,142
and balance them because Photoshop knows

297
00:16:25,142 --> 00:16:28,523
what color this color checker needs to be,

298
00:16:28,523 --> 00:16:30,824
and they'll balance it to get the appropriate values.

299
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:33,964
And this is key for us to get good values

300
00:16:33,964 --> 00:16:35,244
and good base values at the beginning

301
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,605
when we're authoring our textures.

302
00:16:36,605 --> 00:16:40,225
So we even created the spectrum that shows

303
00:16:40,225 --> 00:16:44,066
these are where all the things in life,

304
00:16:44,066 --> 00:16:46,567
this isn't all of them, but it's a handful of common ones

305
00:16:46,567 --> 00:16:49,667
that we use in our game, fall on the value spectrum.

306
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:51,822
And what this shows us is a couple of things.

307
00:16:51,822 --> 00:16:55,423
One is there tends to be what we call the art direction range.

308
00:16:55,423 --> 00:16:59,364
Almost nothing in real life goes above,

309
00:16:59,364 --> 00:17:01,945
doesn't go to pure white, and never goes to pure black.

310
00:17:01,945 --> 00:17:03,626
If something goes to pure black, it's

311
00:17:03,626 --> 00:17:05,666
like some weird special material that's

312
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,127
designed to absorb all light.

313
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:09,228
That rarely ever happens in real life.

314
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:11,908
So we never allow things to go over these values.

315
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,461
The other thing we found, if you see this red line here,

316
00:17:15,461 --> 00:17:19,806
is that most values fall on the darker end of the spectrum.

317
00:17:19,806 --> 00:17:23,930
And we actually see this error in when people paint as well.

318
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:28,155
They tend to author their values or their diffuse colors

319
00:17:28,155 --> 00:17:31,918
too light because they're used to seeing them hit by light.

320
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:34,842
But what happens is you want your diffuse color to be dark.

321
00:17:35,205 --> 00:17:37,947
to allow your light to brighten them up later.

322
00:17:37,947 --> 00:17:42,830
And so this is a common mistake that a lot of artists make

323
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:45,531
is to author too bright because they're

324
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:46,512
used to seeing values in the sun.

325
00:17:46,512 --> 00:17:49,353
So this is something that we control very heavily.

326
00:17:49,353 --> 00:17:52,995
This is to show that same image in grayscale

327
00:17:52,995 --> 00:17:55,877
to also show how much color can fool your eyes.

328
00:17:55,877 --> 00:17:57,878
If you look at those red dots, they

329
00:17:57,878 --> 00:17:59,579
look like they should be much brighter

330
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,880
because you read red as bright.

331
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,861
But their value is actually very dark.

332
00:18:04,487 --> 00:18:06,527
And so we do this because we also

333
00:18:06,527 --> 00:18:09,449
know that you can't trust your eyes when it comes to value

334
00:18:09,449 --> 00:18:11,349
or when it comes to sunlight.

335
00:18:11,349 --> 00:18:13,390
So we spend a lot of time with this.

336
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:16,171
I spend a lot of time talking about it here because honestly,

337
00:18:16,171 --> 00:18:19,313
it is one of the most critical elements of getting

338
00:18:19,313 --> 00:18:22,114
a photorealistic scene.

339
00:18:22,114 --> 00:18:25,455
So we spend a lot of time working on it.

340
00:18:25,455 --> 00:18:26,615
This shows the value of that.

341
00:18:26,615 --> 00:18:28,456
This is an in-game representation.

342
00:18:28,456 --> 00:18:30,377
This is an early shot of our scene.

343
00:18:30,377 --> 00:18:32,318
Ignore there's some broken light maps on the road.

344
00:18:32,991 --> 00:18:37,473
But if you look at the building, it's showing you that almost none of the values are correct here.

345
00:18:37,473 --> 00:18:41,415
The lighting isn't done right, we don't have any bounce light, we don't have good value,

346
00:18:41,415 --> 00:18:43,575
the diffuse colors aren't correct.

347
00:18:43,575 --> 00:18:46,437
And the net result of that is this doesn't look very believable.

348
00:18:46,437 --> 00:18:49,818
It looks very CG, it doesn't look right to your eyes.

349
00:18:49,818 --> 00:18:53,579
Once we've done our pass, we get the right color balance, the right color correct,

350
00:18:53,579 --> 00:18:56,561
we get the right lighting on the scene, we get the right bounce.

351
00:18:56,561 --> 00:19:01,343
These are all the things both in our game and when you're painting or doing anything

352
00:19:01,343 --> 00:19:01,883
that add up.

353
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:08,406
to being a beautifully lit scene that looks photorealistic to you.

354
00:19:08,406 --> 00:19:10,927
And so we spend a lot of time working on this,

355
00:19:10,927 --> 00:19:12,548
and this is a really good representation

356
00:19:12,548 --> 00:19:17,491
of how much getting those values right matters.

357
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:18,852
Just another example.

358
00:19:18,852 --> 00:19:22,134
So if you look at the images, the two images on the top are photo.

359
00:19:22,134 --> 00:19:24,775
The one on the left is actually our old studio.

360
00:19:24,775 --> 00:19:28,157
We did this because we really want to spend a lot of time

361
00:19:28,157 --> 00:19:29,878
going out and rechecking our values.

362
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,972
The image on the bottom is from our game.

363
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:35,714
And you can notice a few things that are slightly off,

364
00:19:35,714 --> 00:19:38,116
like the trees aren't great and maybe the reflections.

365
00:19:38,116 --> 00:19:40,558
But you can see how closely and how much time

366
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:42,360
we spent making sure that our values were

367
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,121
as close as possible.

368
00:19:44,121 --> 00:19:47,064
And then that translates the two images on the right.

369
00:19:47,064 --> 00:19:48,365
That's Laguna Seca.

370
00:19:48,365 --> 00:19:50,907
The image on the top is a photo.

371
00:19:50,907 --> 00:19:53,349
And the image on the bottom is our game.

372
00:19:53,349 --> 00:19:55,010
And we just spent a lot of time, again,

373
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,992
really massaging those values and making sure

374
00:19:56,992 --> 00:19:59,494
that we get them right to produce a photorealistic scene.

375
00:20:00,772 --> 00:20:03,114
And this is just an example of that same scene in Laguna,

376
00:20:03,114 --> 00:20:04,114
just with its value.

377
00:20:04,114 --> 00:20:09,498
So you can kind of see where we landed with that.

378
00:20:09,498 --> 00:20:11,619
So the next thing I want to talk about is palette.

379
00:20:11,619 --> 00:20:14,181
Kind of going along in that we move

380
00:20:14,181 --> 00:20:15,962
in a very sequential manner.

381
00:20:15,962 --> 00:20:17,483
When it comes to palette, palette

382
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:20,065
was what we used to create our mood.

383
00:20:20,065 --> 00:20:22,406
So just a quick anecdote here.

384
00:20:22,406 --> 00:20:23,787
So we did this.

385
00:20:23,787 --> 00:20:28,611
We shot Dubai in the desert when it broke the heat record

386
00:20:28,611 --> 00:20:30,011
for that area for all time.

387
00:20:31,049 --> 00:20:33,451
So while we were out shooting in the sun, it got up to 131 degrees.

388
00:20:33,451 --> 00:20:42,020
So all of our, we were out there, all of our cameras stopped working right around one o'clock in the afternoon.

389
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:46,364
Everything just just shut down. It was just too hot, including us.

390
00:20:46,364 --> 00:20:54,473
So we went back to our car and what we found in our car was that everything that was metal or thin and actually melted so all the little metal springs.

391
00:20:54,732 --> 00:20:59,875
all the coils, all the little metal bits in our camera cases, it all melted into these little

392
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:04,797
puddles of liquid metal. So we went home because we're like, all right, that's probably too much.

393
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:08,939
And we actually pulled the key cards out of our pockets, which were plastic, and they had all

394
00:21:08,939 --> 00:21:13,681
melted too. So we kind of threw them on the desk of the hotel and we're like, wow, how do you guys

395
00:21:13,681 --> 00:21:20,024
deal with this? And the hotel owner is just like, because no one goes out in the day at this time,

396
00:21:20,024 --> 00:21:21,565
are you guys idiots? So.

397
00:21:22,012 --> 00:21:24,533
We really, they really struggled here.

398
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,854
But what we really found was there

399
00:21:26,854 --> 00:21:28,295
was a mood and atmosphere to this

400
00:21:28,295 --> 00:21:30,536
that we wanted to capture, this sense of heat,

401
00:21:30,536 --> 00:21:31,997
this sense of intensity.

402
00:21:31,997 --> 00:21:34,398
And the way we wanted to capture that is through this palette.

403
00:21:34,398 --> 00:21:37,080
What we really liked was this feeling

404
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:41,642
of this warm orange sand against this super cool blue sky.

405
00:21:41,642 --> 00:21:44,504
We felt that was a really great juxtaposition and a great way

406
00:21:44,504 --> 00:21:46,685
to show the intensity and the heat.

407
00:21:46,685 --> 00:21:48,366
You can kind of almost feel it, right?

408
00:21:49,204 --> 00:21:52,886
And so you can see at the bottom we also have what we call a weighted palette, which is to say

409
00:21:52,886 --> 00:21:57,810
the larger blocks are the ones that are going to take up more of the scene, that are going to

410
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:03,034
have a greater effect on the scene. And so this is something we really think about when we're

411
00:22:03,034 --> 00:22:07,757
trying to establish mood. This is another shot of a real world track and us basically doing the same

412
00:22:07,757 --> 00:22:12,300
thing, but really thinking about palette in advance. I'll show you some examples of what

413
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:16,603
the impact that is. This is one of our tracks, Catalunya.

414
00:22:17,081 --> 00:22:19,663
And what it is, this is it just vanilla right out of the box.

415
00:22:19,663 --> 00:22:23,066
And what we wanted was we wanted Catalonia to have more of a mood,

416
00:22:23,066 --> 00:22:23,987
but we weren't sure how.

417
00:22:23,987 --> 00:22:26,349
And we actually used palette and shape language,

418
00:22:26,349 --> 00:22:29,531
which I'll talk about in a minute, to establish that.

419
00:22:29,531 --> 00:22:34,796
So we talked about what if this had like a real high intensity F1 racetrack mood.

420
00:22:34,796 --> 00:22:36,617
And we did this.

421
00:22:36,617 --> 00:22:38,799
So through shape language and through color,

422
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:42,082
this is very stark, almost black and white in terms of it's,

423
00:22:42,082 --> 00:22:44,464
you know, it's very red and white, almost monochrome.

424
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:47,931
but it feels very professional, very, very race-like.

425
00:22:47,931 --> 00:22:51,072
And then we said, well, what if this was a bit more festive?

426
00:22:51,072 --> 00:22:51,972
And we looked at this.

427
00:22:51,972 --> 00:22:53,973
And so you can see, and this also,

428
00:22:53,973 --> 00:22:55,313
if you look at shape language as well,

429
00:22:55,313 --> 00:22:58,934
you can see between palette and shape language,

430
00:22:58,934 --> 00:23:01,975
if you look again, how much this palette is having an effect

431
00:23:01,975 --> 00:23:04,036
on the mood and the complexion of the scene.

432
00:23:04,036 --> 00:23:06,817
And so these are the types of things

433
00:23:06,817 --> 00:23:08,357
that we spend a lot of time thinking about.

434
00:23:08,357 --> 00:23:10,658
What mood do we want to impart to the player?

435
00:23:10,658 --> 00:23:12,898
What impression do we want you to take away?

436
00:23:13,144 --> 00:23:15,887
And that really shows you how much palate has an effect

437
00:23:15,887 --> 00:23:19,031
on your impression of that seed.

438
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:20,874
I talked about shape language, but that's another thing

439
00:23:20,874 --> 00:23:22,155
that we think a lot about.

440
00:23:22,155 --> 00:23:24,618
The shape language really helps determine also

441
00:23:24,618 --> 00:23:26,500
the mood and the feel.

442
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,624
In this case, what we liked was that Dubai is actually

443
00:23:29,624 --> 00:23:31,987
located right on the ocean, which not a lot of people know.

444
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:35,203
And there's a lot of sailboats and things like that.

445
00:23:35,203 --> 00:23:36,984
And we actually thought that motif

446
00:23:36,984 --> 00:23:38,645
would be a really cool juxtaposition

447
00:23:38,645 --> 00:23:41,468
against sort of the harsh, dry, rock-like atmosphere

448
00:23:41,468 --> 00:23:42,429
of the desert.

449
00:23:42,429 --> 00:23:45,051
So we created all these really nice sail shapes.

450
00:23:45,051 --> 00:23:46,011
These are concepts.

451
00:23:46,011 --> 00:23:48,914
And we applied them to all of the objects in the scene.

452
00:23:48,914 --> 00:23:50,935
So we carried this through our tents,

453
00:23:50,935 --> 00:23:54,418
through our grandstands, this idea of shapes, sails,

454
00:23:54,418 --> 00:23:55,999
very tent-like structures.

455
00:23:55,999 --> 00:23:59,823
And here's an example of those structures juxtaposed.

456
00:23:59,823 --> 00:24:01,604
This is a concept against the scene.

457
00:24:01,943 --> 00:24:04,426
And you can see how much that shape language impacts

458
00:24:04,426 --> 00:24:09,230
and plays against, excuse me, against how we compose.

459
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:10,811
So really great values there.

460
00:24:10,811 --> 00:24:14,154
And this is a final concept that we did

461
00:24:14,154 --> 00:24:17,897
that kind of pulls all those elements together.

462
00:24:17,897 --> 00:24:21,300
Here's a palette that we use for the scene.

463
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,242
Here's kind of pulling that shapes into the buildings,

464
00:24:24,242 --> 00:24:26,784
into everything, just to give you that overall feel.

465
00:24:26,784 --> 00:24:28,326
So it's something that we think a lot about

466
00:24:28,326 --> 00:24:29,386
when we're making our scenes.

467
00:24:31,417 --> 00:24:35,778
All these things is to say that we're trying to impart a mood and atmosphere.

468
00:24:35,778 --> 00:24:39,940
What's really interesting to me is when this is Prague, this is one of our crown jewel tracks.

469
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:45,762
When we went here, we actually were really, at first, really attracted to this one image that we had that showed Prague.

470
00:24:46,033 --> 00:24:47,214
It was almost grayscale.

471
00:24:47,214 --> 00:24:48,355
It showed an Aston Martin.

472
00:24:48,355 --> 00:24:49,376
It looked really haunting.

473
00:24:49,376 --> 00:24:52,678
But when we got to Prague, this was actually the atmosphere

474
00:24:52,678 --> 00:24:54,960
that stood out to us, this kind of golden light,

475
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,021
these Renaissance colors.

476
00:24:57,021 --> 00:25:00,324
This mood was with us the entire time we were here.

477
00:25:00,324 --> 00:25:01,565
It had this really nice haze.

478
00:25:01,565 --> 00:25:03,566
And we're like, oh, this is the mood we want to capture.

479
00:25:03,566 --> 00:25:04,507
We just love this feel.

480
00:25:04,507 --> 00:25:08,790
And this is often why we send our track leads on reference trips.

481
00:25:09,146 --> 00:25:12,988
So they can take away this sort of feel, the smell, the mood

482
00:25:12,988 --> 00:25:15,989
that you really don't get from looking at pictures a lot of the time.

483
00:25:15,989 --> 00:25:19,211
And so we make sure that we impart that mood into all of our tracks.

484
00:25:19,211 --> 00:25:22,472
Another little interesting anecdote here.

485
00:25:22,472 --> 00:25:24,273
This is the Charles Bridge.

486
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:27,055
So we took a laser scanner out onto the Charles Bridge.

487
00:25:28,099 --> 00:25:31,983
And if you if you know what a laser scanner is at the time it was six feet tall

488
00:25:31,983 --> 00:25:36,987
Looks like a giant evil robot and we put it we set it up at about 4 a.m

489
00:25:36,987 --> 00:25:40,491
In the middle of this iconic bridge structure

490
00:25:40,491 --> 00:25:45,155
And I don't know if you've ever set a large piece of technology in the middle of an iconic bridge structure at 4 a.m

491
00:25:45,155 --> 00:25:46,997
But it tends to freak everybody out

492
00:25:46,997 --> 00:25:53,383
So while we were in the middle of laser scanning, even though we had permits cops started running at us from both sides of the bridge

493
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:59,363
And so we were frantically trying to get the scan to complete before the cops got to us.

494
00:25:59,363 --> 00:26:03,646
And we just, we got the last rotation right before they got to us and we said, oh we're sorry,

495
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:09,589
here are our permits, we apologize, we picked up everything, we moved on. But yeah, this was a

496
00:26:09,589 --> 00:26:15,472
real challenge to shoot. So anyway, referencing for tracks is always entertaining. But these are

497
00:26:15,472 --> 00:26:22,415
just, so moving on, these are just other examples of mood and atmosphere for a track. This here is

498
00:26:22,415 --> 00:26:23,216
showing Daytona.

499
00:26:24,392 --> 00:26:29,416
This is also a very different mood, hot, white heat, packed people.

500
00:26:29,416 --> 00:26:33,839
This is high noon, very intense shadows, so a very different mood.

501
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:40,004
This is the Nürburgring, so sort of haunted, grayscale, just very, very different mood in itself.

502
00:26:40,004 --> 00:26:45,828
And so these are the things, things we think about when we go to each of our tracks.

503
00:26:45,828 --> 00:26:51,632
Just showing, and this is concepts that we do afterwards to translate those who didn't go into these mood boards.

504
00:26:51,875 --> 00:26:54,857
to give the player a feel for all the things we talked about.

505
00:26:54,857 --> 00:26:58,179
Haze, color palette, light temperature, all that.

506
00:26:58,179 --> 00:27:01,400
And that's what we use to create our scenes.

507
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,182
We use things like fog here and sky.

508
00:27:04,182 --> 00:27:07,024
Sky has a huge impact on everything in your scene.

509
00:27:07,024 --> 00:27:08,385
You've probably seen that when you paint,

510
00:27:08,385 --> 00:27:09,185
when you do anything.

511
00:27:09,185 --> 00:27:10,666
So really paying attention to the sky

512
00:27:10,666 --> 00:27:12,807
and what kind of mood you want to impart with that

513
00:27:12,807 --> 00:27:13,728
is a big deal for us.

514
00:27:13,728 --> 00:27:16,990
So I'm moving on to painting with light.

515
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:18,491
I'm gonna take a quick drink though.

516
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:38,458
This is another thing that we do quite a bit of is we use light, not often the light scenario that we have is not meeting our needs or it's not giving us the effect that we want. So we spend some time changing our light using our light.

517
00:27:38,458 --> 00:27:43,701
In this case, this is an early concept that we did. The problem we were having with this tunnel was it was too dark.

518
00:27:43,701 --> 00:27:50,745
And it was really difficult for you to get a sense of parallax because there was no contrast for you to be moving again. So it felt like you weren't moving very fast.

519
00:27:51,763 --> 00:28:03,207
So what we did was what we often tend to do in these situations is we actually started to cut holes in the roof, we started to move the sun direction to get more contrast in the scene to get more visual interest to get that sense of parallax.

520
00:28:03,207 --> 00:28:07,468
This is us continuing to experiment with that we still weren't getting what we wanted.

521
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,941
Until we finally landed here, this

522
00:28:09,941 --> 00:28:11,622
gave us the right amount of light.

523
00:28:11,622 --> 00:28:13,343
It gave us the right amount of visual interest,

524
00:28:13,343 --> 00:28:14,664
the right amount of contrast, and gave you

525
00:28:14,664 --> 00:28:15,984
that sense of speed.

526
00:28:15,984 --> 00:28:16,945
So we'll often do this.

527
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,886
We'll either add or remove objects.

528
00:28:18,886 --> 00:28:19,946
We'll add tree walls.

529
00:28:19,946 --> 00:28:22,688
We'll do things to use light to our advantage

530
00:28:22,688 --> 00:28:24,289
to give the effect that we want to give.

531
00:28:24,289 --> 00:28:28,811
Moving on, I'll just touch on this real quickly.

532
00:28:28,811 --> 00:28:30,793
One of the other issues is with scale.

533
00:28:30,793 --> 00:28:33,194
What I don't actually have right here, which I apologize for,

534
00:28:33,194 --> 00:28:34,735
is an example of bad scale.

535
00:28:34,735 --> 00:28:36,616
But this is the example of good scale.

536
00:28:36,994 --> 00:28:41,817
What we found early on when we had so few polys to deal with is that we would spend all of our

537
00:28:41,817 --> 00:28:47,220
polys on our big objects and ignore our little ones. And what happened was that actually made

538
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:52,563
everything in our scene feel really cartoony, and you also didn't get a sense of speed.

539
00:28:52,563 --> 00:28:56,525
When you don't see these small grounded objects that the player is familiar with,

540
00:28:56,525 --> 00:29:01,128
then there's no sense of context. There's no feeling for how big a thing is, what its scale is,

541
00:29:01,128 --> 00:29:02,869
or how quickly you're moving against it.

542
00:29:03,307 --> 00:29:09,109
So we actually had to double down on all these small grounding elements, all these small set pieces.

543
00:29:09,109 --> 00:29:22,895
So if we have a building, including the windowsill, if we had a race side object, including these like kind of these booths and these carts, because we want to give you a sense of context and why and how big something is.

544
00:29:22,895 --> 00:29:25,156
And so we actually double down on these.

545
00:29:25,156 --> 00:29:30,898
We actually spend less polys in our large building and our large assets and more polys on these small grounding elements.

546
00:29:31,293 --> 00:29:33,835
to give you that sense of scale and proportion.

547
00:29:33,835 --> 00:29:35,996
This is something that we see often

548
00:29:35,996 --> 00:29:37,978
that beginning students don't do well.

549
00:29:37,978 --> 00:29:39,819
They forget to add these grounding elements.

550
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:42,301
And as a result, their scenes feel cartoony

551
00:29:42,301 --> 00:29:44,082
because you don't know how large they are.

552
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:48,265
So finally, I wanna talk about texture.

553
00:29:48,265 --> 00:29:49,787
And again, I saved this one for last

554
00:29:49,787 --> 00:29:52,649
because while this does add a great deal to your scene,

555
00:29:52,649 --> 00:29:54,910
it tends to be the area that students

556
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:57,372
and even professionals tend to jump to too quickly.

557
00:29:58,113 --> 00:30:02,356
And so texture is obviously important to give you that sense of detail and surface type.

558
00:30:02,356 --> 00:30:04,918
What is this thing going to feel like when I touch it?

559
00:30:04,918 --> 00:30:08,681
But you don't want to go here too early.

560
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:12,984
So if anyone is familiar with photogrammetry, this has been a groundbreaking technique for us

561
00:30:12,984 --> 00:30:14,725
and something we leverage heavily now.

562
00:30:14,725 --> 00:30:22,551
But this is the, where you take a series of images with your camera and then you use a program

563
00:30:22,551 --> 00:30:24,392
like Agisoft or RealityCapture.

564
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:27,113
to assemble those pictures into a 3D model.

565
00:30:27,113 --> 00:30:30,638
And so this is an example of a model that we did here.

566
00:30:30,638 --> 00:30:33,322
This is a tree using photogrammetry.

567
00:30:33,322 --> 00:30:36,507
And our artists build almost all their assets

568
00:30:36,507 --> 00:30:38,450
with this technique at this point.

569
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:40,052
And it's been really awesome for us.

570
00:30:41,088 --> 00:30:45,411
This is another example of where we created this rumble strip using photogrammetry.

571
00:30:45,411 --> 00:30:48,734
And it just gives you and see all these storytelling elements, all this,

572
00:30:48,734 --> 00:30:50,275
all this really nice texture.

573
00:30:50,275 --> 00:30:55,019
This is these are all the little elements that add up to making something look

574
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,481
photorealistic. In this case, we are using a photo,

575
00:30:57,481 --> 00:31:03,586
but as often the details that people miss when they're creating those textures is

576
00:31:03,586 --> 00:31:05,567
all those little details and story elements.

577
00:31:07,996 --> 00:31:10,038
So now I'm going to show you all this in practice.

578
00:31:10,038 --> 00:31:13,040
These are a few before and afters.

579
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:16,363
This is obviously before, where we forget this all the time

580
00:31:16,363 --> 00:31:16,543
as well.

581
00:31:16,543 --> 00:31:18,905
And so oftentimes what we'll say is, you know what?

582
00:31:18,905 --> 00:31:19,906
The scene is not working.

583
00:31:19,906 --> 00:31:21,928
We're not using all the principles

584
00:31:21,928 --> 00:31:22,948
that we just talked about.

585
00:31:23,358 --> 00:31:27,581
And we have our concept artists actually go in and do paint overs to help guide us.

586
00:31:27,581 --> 00:31:29,562
This scene right here is doing everything wrong.

587
00:31:29,562 --> 00:31:32,463
We're lacking those elements of scale.

588
00:31:32,463 --> 00:31:33,484
It's all one value.

589
00:31:33,484 --> 00:31:34,665
We're not painting with light.

590
00:31:34,665 --> 00:31:37,226
Saturation isn't good.

591
00:31:37,226 --> 00:31:39,567
It's doing everything that we just talked.

592
00:31:39,567 --> 00:31:41,328
It's not doing everything that we just talked about.

593
00:31:41,328 --> 00:31:42,649
So we say, help us out, concept.

594
00:31:42,649 --> 00:31:43,769
And they'll create this image.

595
00:31:43,769 --> 00:31:50,293
And you can see what a difference this makes in terms of value, in terms of visual storytelling,

596
00:31:50,293 --> 00:31:52,294
in terms of painting with light.

597
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:54,546
It's doing all those things I talked about,

598
00:31:54,546 --> 00:31:55,607
and the difference is stark.

599
00:31:55,607 --> 00:31:57,248
And we have to do this all the time

600
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:58,269
because we forget as well.

601
00:31:58,269 --> 00:32:00,911
And it's something I often recommend students do

602
00:32:00,911 --> 00:32:03,314
is when they get about three quarters of the way

603
00:32:03,314 --> 00:32:06,617
through the piece, take it into Photoshop, paint over it.

604
00:32:06,617 --> 00:32:08,818
It's really easy to iterate in Photoshop.

605
00:32:08,818 --> 00:32:11,461
And we find that it helps break that sort of disconnect

606
00:32:11,461 --> 00:32:12,522
that you have in CG.

607
00:32:12,522 --> 00:32:14,403
And so we'll do this a lot.

608
00:32:15,925 --> 00:32:20,369
This is another example, barring the terrible crowds that are over the bottom right.

609
00:32:20,369 --> 00:32:23,491
Again, scene feels, it feels okay, but it feels flat.

610
00:32:23,491 --> 00:32:25,152
It doesn't feel dynamic.

611
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:26,613
It doesn't have those elements of storytelling.

612
00:32:26,613 --> 00:32:29,715
You can see the reference image down in the left and even the thumbnail

613
00:32:29,715 --> 00:32:31,817
read is better than what we have.

614
00:32:31,817 --> 00:32:34,139
So we took it in and we said, what can you do concept?

615
00:32:34,139 --> 00:32:35,359
And they produced this image.

616
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:39,162
And again, it brings that, those values, that value separation.

617
00:32:39,162 --> 00:32:40,143
It brings that contrast.

618
00:32:40,143 --> 00:32:43,425
They even put in smoke and birds and all these little details that we forgot about.

619
00:32:43,913 --> 00:32:45,774
So highly recommend doing this, and it really

620
00:32:45,774 --> 00:32:47,295
helps to illustrate all these points

621
00:32:47,295 --> 00:32:50,037
that I've been talking about.

622
00:32:50,037 --> 00:32:52,478
So yeah, just talking about the cohesive frame.

623
00:32:52,478 --> 00:32:54,039
None of this is new.

624
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:57,380
These are all core values that everyone knows about in art,

625
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,021
but we tend to forget.

626
00:32:58,021 --> 00:33:01,903
But this is a combination of all these things, line, shape,

627
00:33:01,903 --> 00:33:04,524
color, texture, value, form, and space.

628
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:07,266
And it's easy to forget them, but they're

629
00:33:07,266 --> 00:33:09,447
just as important in CG as they are

630
00:33:09,447 --> 00:33:10,307
when you're doing a painting.

631
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:16,422
So the next thing I want to talk about is cadence, how you move through the frame.

632
00:33:16,422 --> 00:33:23,606
So everything I've talked about now is still frames, but we also want to talk about how we design the experience when you're racing through a track.

633
00:33:23,606 --> 00:33:31,951
Early on, we did this poorly. When we designed our racetracks, this is a concept that we did before we did one of our racetracks called Rio.

634
00:33:31,951 --> 00:33:38,455
And what we said is we're going to put a visual moment, something to blow you away on every single corner of the track.

635
00:33:38,815 --> 00:33:43,558
And the problem is, as everyone knows, when you turn everything up to 11, nothing is.

636
00:33:43,558 --> 00:33:49,060
And so what we found was that the player had no areas of visual rest.

637
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:54,723
They were overwhelmed and they weren't getting the impact of a lot of the areas that we designed.

638
00:33:54,723 --> 00:33:56,664
So this was an important thing for us.

639
00:33:56,664 --> 00:34:00,966
This is a track that we designed later, this was Dubai.

640
00:34:00,966 --> 00:34:06,168
And what we said was we're going to have four key moments, four areas that we do turn up to 11.

641
00:34:06,975 --> 00:34:11,277
and allow many moments or areas of rest in between.

642
00:34:11,277 --> 00:34:13,357
So we like to think about this as a piece of music.

643
00:34:13,357 --> 00:34:15,618
You want high points, you want mid points,

644
00:34:15,618 --> 00:34:17,678
you want areas of rest.

645
00:34:17,678 --> 00:34:19,899
It's often how you look at a painting.

646
00:34:19,899 --> 00:34:21,580
You wanna make sure that not everything is up to 11.

647
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:24,180
And so now we design our tracks,

648
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:26,481
and in my opinion, they're much more successful

649
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,242
because the key moments that we design

650
00:34:28,242 --> 00:34:30,362
have much more impact to the player.

651
00:34:32,501 --> 00:34:35,962
We also don't spread our detail over the whole scene,

652
00:34:35,962 --> 00:34:38,603
like peanut butter, this is a mistake that we made early on.

653
00:34:38,603 --> 00:34:41,004
What we do is, this is a shot from our game,

654
00:34:41,004 --> 00:34:43,765
this is the iconic hotel from Yasmarina.

655
00:34:43,765 --> 00:34:46,666
What we do is we design these areas

656
00:34:46,666 --> 00:34:49,787
to have the most visual impact.

657
00:34:49,787 --> 00:34:53,028
And we actually put about 80% of our art efforts

658
00:34:53,028 --> 00:34:54,888
on these areas, because we know

659
00:34:54,888 --> 00:34:57,489
as you're driving around the track, there's the hotel again,

660
00:34:57,489 --> 00:35:00,350
that that is what you're gonna see the majority of the time,

661
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:02,351
and that's what's gonna have your visual impression.

662
00:35:02,709 --> 00:35:06,893
And we let the other stuff just kind of bleed off into the, into the distance.

663
00:35:06,893 --> 00:35:20,286
This is an example from Rio. This is basically what I was talking about before where if we know that this is on at the end of a long straightaway we built this iconic moment this shot of Sugarloaf Mountain, and we know that we have your

664
00:35:20,286 --> 00:35:20,967
attention here.

665
00:35:21,179 --> 00:35:23,120
This is a low impact gameplay area.

666
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,621
You're going straight, you're going downhill.

667
00:35:24,621 --> 00:35:26,762
There's not a lot that you have to do here.

668
00:35:26,762 --> 00:35:30,523
And so we often will design our racetracks to build in these straights

669
00:35:30,523 --> 00:35:34,765
so that we can focus your attention on these moments so you can appreciate them,

670
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:36,206
so you have the time to appreciate them.

671
00:35:36,206 --> 00:35:39,147
And then when you take these high intensity corners,

672
00:35:39,147 --> 00:35:42,389
you know, we we we just spend less time on them.

673
00:35:42,389 --> 00:35:44,650
We put our details in around the corners instead.

674
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:48,312
But really designing this experience, knowing what your player

675
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:50,873
is going to be doing and putting your detail as appropriate.

676
00:35:53,360 --> 00:36:08,600
And this is just again talking to we also do this with our gameplay. We actually designed skids impact moments things like that, because we know where we're going to have your attention and where we can spend our attention to detail.

677
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,404
This is an iconic turn at the end of Laguna Seca.

678
00:36:12,109 --> 00:36:14,530
And so this is a turn that everybody misses.

679
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:16,011
And we wanted to tell you that story

680
00:36:16,011 --> 00:36:17,972
and kind of forecast it for gameplay

681
00:36:17,972 --> 00:36:20,373
to say this is a difficult turn

682
00:36:20,373 --> 00:36:22,375
and you're probably gonna miss it too.

683
00:36:22,375 --> 00:36:25,356
So we do our skids, we do this sort of like dirt runoff

684
00:36:25,356 --> 00:36:27,217
to say a lot of action happens here.

685
00:36:27,217 --> 00:36:29,339
A lot of people take this turn wrong

686
00:36:29,339 --> 00:36:30,559
and we wanna forecast that.

687
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:32,961
And so we tell you this story

688
00:36:32,961 --> 00:36:34,242
when we're designing our tracks.

689
00:36:36,603 --> 00:36:47,227
So again, these are all different examples where we pull some of that visual storytelling into our tracks when we're designing that cadence and it just pays off for us in a big way.

690
00:36:47,227 --> 00:36:52,610
And again, like I mentioned, we designed it like a piece of music. This is a waveform of Beethoven's Fifth.

691
00:36:52,610 --> 00:37:05,035
So it's just really interesting. It shows you throughout the piece. They have their highs, their lows, they kind of have two big centerpieces, and then they have areas of rest. And this is how we want to design our experience as you move through it.

692
00:37:07,774 --> 00:37:21,471
So the last thing, like I mentioned, we're getting low on time here, so I'll move through this pretty quickly. There's a lot of charts in here, so try not to glaze over. I'm going to move through them pretty quickly, but what this piece is really telling is about

693
00:37:21,692 --> 00:37:24,314
we have to spend a lot of time thinking about performance.

694
00:37:24,314 --> 00:37:26,075
So we're not just designing our tracks

695
00:37:26,075 --> 00:37:28,117
and designing our visuals in a vacuum.

696
00:37:28,117 --> 00:37:30,198
We have to think about GPU and CPU

697
00:37:30,198 --> 00:37:32,400
and all the limits that we have,

698
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,303
but we actually find it sort of enables us in a way.

699
00:37:35,303 --> 00:37:37,624
This is the sandbox that we have to play in

700
00:37:37,624 --> 00:37:40,847
and we have to be creative within it.

701
00:37:40,847 --> 00:37:42,969
So these are just for anyone that's interested.

702
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,710
These are the budgets that we have.

703
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:46,331
This is only to show this 2.8 number

704
00:37:46,331 --> 00:37:48,933
is how much GPU we have for our tracks.

705
00:37:49,385 --> 00:37:51,385
For anyone who's familiar with GPU budgets,

706
00:37:51,385 --> 00:37:53,466
that's not a lot of time.

707
00:37:53,466 --> 00:37:57,987
So that's just highlighting how little time you have with it.

708
00:37:57,987 --> 00:38:02,249
These are tools that our artists use to evaluate budgets.

709
00:38:02,249 --> 00:38:05,850
This is just a chart showing that anywhere that's

710
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,390
over-performance turns red.

711
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:10,431
And our artists have a nice visualization of the track

712
00:38:10,431 --> 00:38:13,432
to say, those are the areas that we have to work on.

713
00:38:13,432 --> 00:38:16,493
And this is what we're going to bang at

714
00:38:16,493 --> 00:38:17,594
to improve our performance.

715
00:38:17,594 --> 00:38:18,914
And this is a great tool for us.

716
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:22,859
So how do we prioritize these visual investments?

717
00:38:22,859 --> 00:38:25,922
We really have to think about where you are on the track in advance.

718
00:38:25,922 --> 00:38:29,585
This is a photo from Bathurst showing from this area,

719
00:38:29,585 --> 00:38:32,187
you can actually see 20 miles out into the distance.

720
00:38:32,187 --> 00:38:34,729
So we have to know you're going to see 20 miles or out.

721
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:36,250
How are we going to show this?

722
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:38,932
We'll do this with map paintings. We'll do this with LODs.

723
00:38:38,932 --> 00:38:42,315
But we have to plan this out in advance.

724
00:38:42,315 --> 00:38:43,696
This is another shot of Prague.

725
00:38:44,147 --> 00:38:46,369
So we know we've designed this racetrack.

726
00:38:46,369 --> 00:38:49,591
So we know this is an area where we want to show off the whole city.

727
00:38:49,591 --> 00:38:52,233
We know that you're going to be looking far out into the distance.

728
00:38:52,233 --> 00:38:57,897
But we want to make sure that we're not that we have the room for this performance.

729
00:38:57,897 --> 00:39:00,720
So we designed this so that there's almost no vegetation.

730
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,241
There's very little grass.

731
00:39:02,241 --> 00:39:04,022
There's not much blocking your view.

732
00:39:04,022 --> 00:39:06,864
We're not spending a lot of attention there because we want your focus to be in

733
00:39:06,864 --> 00:39:07,585
the distance.

734
00:39:07,861 --> 00:39:10,762
We thought a lot about how we were going to LOD the city.

735
00:39:10,762 --> 00:39:13,123
We drew a lot of map paintings for this.

736
00:39:13,123 --> 00:39:15,244
So this type of thing takes a lot of pre-planning

737
00:39:15,244 --> 00:39:17,225
and design in advance.

738
00:39:17,225 --> 00:39:19,166
If you don't go in with this sort of pre-planning,

739
00:39:19,166 --> 00:39:21,587
you can wind up and really put yourself in really bad spots

740
00:39:21,587 --> 00:39:24,689
and have to spend a lot of time redesigning and optimizing.

741
00:39:24,689 --> 00:39:28,450
This just shows that we look at these every day

742
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:30,631
and we're trying to turn them green.

743
00:39:30,631 --> 00:39:32,352
That's basically all this graph shows.

744
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:34,313
We spend about two years doing this, though.

745
00:39:34,313 --> 00:39:37,114
So it's part of the challenges of being an artist in the games

746
00:39:37,114 --> 00:39:37,555
industry.

747
00:39:38,522 --> 00:39:42,807
Again, charts of GPU, probably less interesting for the group.

748
00:39:42,807 --> 00:39:45,930
Debug menus, less interesting.

749
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:47,632
And pics, so we'll just skip through all that.

750
00:39:47,632 --> 00:39:49,975
These are all tools that we use to evaluate a seed.

751
00:39:51,785 --> 00:39:55,326
So some of the pitfalls that we had for all of this

752
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:58,027
is we do a lot of this tuning by hand.

753
00:39:58,027 --> 00:40:01,268
And so what we're doing moving forward for us,

754
00:40:01,268 --> 00:40:02,808
in case you guys are interested, is

755
00:40:02,808 --> 00:40:04,809
we're looking to automate a lot of this.

756
00:40:04,809 --> 00:40:06,629
So instead of the artist hand tuning,

757
00:40:06,629 --> 00:40:09,490
we create levers that allow us to do things like turn up scene

758
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:12,670
density, turn down grass, to give us

759
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:15,651
more levers to play with and less hand tuning of assets

760
00:40:15,651 --> 00:40:16,872
to optimize for performance.

761
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:20,891
This is just showing you some visual examples

762
00:40:20,891 --> 00:40:24,552
of how a game moves through its development.

763
00:40:24,552 --> 00:40:27,874
This is showing Rio early on, doesn't look that great.

764
00:40:27,874 --> 00:40:29,694
Also has a lot of problems with performance.

765
00:40:29,694 --> 00:40:32,135
That number in the top right is 8.8 milliseconds.

766
00:40:32,135 --> 00:40:34,116
It needs to be down closer to around five.

767
00:40:34,116 --> 00:40:37,157
This is after we spent a great deal amount of time

768
00:40:37,157 --> 00:40:39,798
optimizing, you can see we've done a lot of the things

769
00:40:39,798 --> 00:40:43,499
that we talked about, composition, palette, value.

770
00:40:43,499 --> 00:40:45,720
And we got the scene to about 5.8 milliseconds,

771
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,681
which was able to run just fine.

772
00:40:48,422 --> 00:40:50,004
And these are all the different types of things

773
00:40:50,004 --> 00:40:51,485
that we did to get there.

774
00:40:51,485 --> 00:40:53,648
This is another scene.

775
00:40:53,648 --> 00:40:55,289
This is a scene that we got back right

776
00:40:55,289 --> 00:40:56,591
from our overseas vendors.

777
00:40:56,591 --> 00:40:59,193
It had a lot of issues with everything we talked about.

778
00:40:59,193 --> 00:41:00,995
Again, value scene composition

779
00:41:00,995 --> 00:41:02,857
and our artists come in and they balance it.

780
00:41:02,857 --> 00:41:05,860
And so you can see the big difference that we have there

781
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:06,801
and also optimize it.

782
00:41:06,801 --> 00:41:09,344
We went from 6.7 milliseconds to 5.4.

783
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:16,350
So this is what we get back from our artists, and then this is what we have to do to polish

784
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:21,272
internally to get it to a place where we can ship it. So big difference there.

785
00:41:21,272 --> 00:41:24,893
And again, this is calling out some of those things in specific detail.

786
00:41:24,893 --> 00:41:27,954
This is showing...

787
00:41:28,109 --> 00:41:29,190
Here, let me pause it real quick.

788
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:31,131
This is actually showing a really interesting thing.

789
00:41:31,131 --> 00:41:33,092
When we went from five to six, we actually

790
00:41:33,092 --> 00:41:35,374
added a number of features like night and wet

791
00:41:35,374 --> 00:41:37,555
and a bunch of things that actually ate performance.

792
00:41:37,555 --> 00:41:41,158
So what we had to do is we had to draw the same level, Prague,

793
00:41:41,158 --> 00:41:43,319
with actually less performance than we had.

794
00:41:43,319 --> 00:41:45,201
So we had to make it look just as pretty,

795
00:41:45,201 --> 00:41:50,624
but we had to find clever ways to rebalance our scene to deal

796
00:41:50,624 --> 00:41:52,065
with not having as much performance.

797
00:41:59,298 --> 00:42:25,931
Sorry, let me go back.

798
00:42:26,637 --> 00:42:29,418
So that might be a case where you say, but Matt, five looks better.

799
00:42:29,418 --> 00:42:33,639
And honestly, for this particular scene, I'm just glad it doesn't look worse.

800
00:42:33,639 --> 00:42:36,800
It was really difficult to get down, but we had to do a lot of clever

801
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,421
things with composition, removing trees, doing all that.

802
00:42:39,421 --> 00:42:44,283
And this is the type of thing that artists do often to to get where we need to go.

803
00:42:44,283 --> 00:42:49,225
This next thing, and we're almost at the end here, is to show you a time lapse

804
00:42:49,225 --> 00:42:51,706
of how we build up a scene over the course of development

805
00:42:51,706 --> 00:42:53,226
that I thought you guys would find interesting.

806
00:42:53,226 --> 00:42:55,127
So this is going to show you Dubai and Rio.

807
00:43:27,156 --> 00:43:32,677
Yeah, so just to summarize, this is really again this is doubling down on core art principles

808
00:43:32,677 --> 00:43:38,019
and those are composition, adding fidelity and detail where the players at natural eye

809
00:43:38,019 --> 00:43:38,519
flow is.

810
00:43:38,823 --> 00:43:42,404
Those core principles of value, palette, shape, and composition.

811
00:43:42,404 --> 00:43:43,205
Don't lose them.

812
00:43:43,205 --> 00:43:44,906
We do often in the industry.

813
00:43:44,906 --> 00:43:47,327
They're really sort of fundamental,

814
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:49,307
but it's amazing how often we forget.

815
00:43:49,307 --> 00:43:51,308
Build your scene from big to small.

816
00:43:51,308 --> 00:43:53,109
Don't focus on the fine details too quickly.

817
00:43:53,109 --> 00:43:56,131
Design the cadence of your experience.

818
00:43:56,131 --> 00:43:57,351
Design a rhythm and flow.

819
00:43:57,351 --> 00:43:59,132
Don't edit everything at 11.

820
00:43:59,132 --> 00:44:02,373
Plan for your pinch points in advance.

821
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:04,214
Really do a lot of work on pre-production.

822
00:44:04,214 --> 00:44:08,196
Understand what your scene is going to be before you edit it.

823
00:44:08,701 --> 00:44:11,342
check on performance daily in our case,

824
00:44:11,342 --> 00:44:13,504
and then give your artists the tools they need

825
00:44:13,504 --> 00:44:14,564
to solve those issues.

826
00:44:14,564 --> 00:44:16,906
So that's it.

827
00:44:16,906 --> 00:44:18,006
That's everything.

828
00:44:18,006 --> 00:44:20,328
I hope you guys enjoyed the talk

829
00:44:20,328 --> 00:44:22,629
and I'd like to open it up at this point to Q&A.

830
00:44:22,629 --> 00:44:24,090
Thank you.

831
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:25,971
Thank you so much, Matt.

832
00:44:25,971 --> 00:44:26,971
That's amazing.

833
00:44:26,971 --> 00:44:28,892
Even though I've seen and played it,

834
00:44:28,892 --> 00:44:32,475
just seeing the breakdown is,

835
00:44:32,475 --> 00:44:33,935
honestly, it's pretty ridiculous.

836
00:44:33,935 --> 00:44:36,017
What did you say?

837
00:44:36,726 --> 00:44:41,469
So there have been some questions during the presentation. I kind of collected them up and I'm

838
00:44:41,469 --> 00:44:48,753
not in any particular order but I'll try and throw some at you now and you know we'll go from there.

839
00:44:48,753 --> 00:44:53,836
So I thought it was a pretty interesting question. Do you hand draw all the concepts or are they 100

840
00:44:53,836 --> 00:45:01,061
computer generated? So we have we actually have a group of very talented CG art painters that

841
00:45:01,061 --> 00:45:04,643
they do a lot of hand painting.

842
00:45:04,953 --> 00:45:07,394
However, they also do photo bashing.

843
00:45:07,394 --> 00:45:10,696
It really depends on the goal of the concept

844
00:45:10,696 --> 00:45:13,858
is to get the point across in as little time as possible.

845
00:45:13,858 --> 00:45:16,179
So they'll use whatever tools are at their disposal

846
00:45:16,179 --> 00:45:19,621
to get there, but they're actually very talented painters

847
00:45:19,621 --> 00:45:21,942
and a number of what they do is also hand drawn.

848
00:45:21,942 --> 00:45:22,322
Right.

849
00:45:22,322 --> 00:45:27,105
Another question, how long does it take to do one track?

850
00:45:27,105 --> 00:45:30,767
Maybe like, let's talk about like an original track

851
00:45:30,767 --> 00:45:32,588
for you guys, how long would it take?

852
00:45:33,052 --> 00:45:38,876
Yeah, that's a really interesting question because it really depends on where we are in the project.

853
00:45:38,876 --> 00:45:45,341
Usually the first track that we create, we'll start iterating a typical development cycle

854
00:45:45,341 --> 00:45:51,966
for us is two years, and we'll start a track relatively early on, maybe six months after

855
00:45:51,966 --> 00:45:52,667
pre-production.

856
00:45:54,355 --> 00:45:58,118
And it takes us about a year and a half to make that first track.

857
00:45:58,118 --> 00:46:01,680
After that, our crown jewels, what we call our fictional environments,

858
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:05,823
they'll tend to take maybe less time a year, maybe even nine months.

859
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:08,545
But fictional tracks just need more time iterating.

860
00:46:08,545 --> 00:46:13,488
Our real world tracks, when we're first developing them, take about a year

861
00:46:13,488 --> 00:46:17,791
and then we get those down to six, maybe even four months at times.

862
00:46:17,791 --> 00:46:20,873
And really, a lot of that is our artists are getting more familiar

863
00:46:20,873 --> 00:46:23,095
with the system, our tools are getting more developed.

864
00:46:23,535 --> 00:46:29,137
So it goes from a longer time to a shorter time over our development cycle.

865
00:46:29,137 --> 00:46:33,639
So I would say on average, it takes about a year to develop a track.

866
00:46:33,639 --> 00:46:42,923
Just curious to how many like how do you guys handle the art team like how many artists. I know you guys also do outsourcing what what what does that kind of look like.

867
00:46:43,563 --> 00:46:45,965
Yeah, so we have sort of three categories.

868
00:46:45,965 --> 00:46:49,828
We'll have our internal artists, and that's a smaller team.

869
00:46:49,828 --> 00:46:52,610
We've actually grown over the last few years,

870
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:55,332
but that's typically about eight to 10

871
00:46:55,332 --> 00:46:57,133
on, say, the environment team.

872
00:46:57,133 --> 00:47:00,796
I'll use them because it's a typical ratio for us.

873
00:47:00,796 --> 00:47:05,079
Internal artists, maybe less, maybe closer to six.

874
00:47:05,079 --> 00:47:10,624
And then we'll have maybe another 12 to 18 contractors

875
00:47:10,624 --> 00:47:12,825
that we also have internally at the studio.

876
00:47:13,286 --> 00:47:20,071
at our peak and then we'll outsource to you know three or four different outsource companies and

877
00:47:20,071 --> 00:47:24,134
in that case we could have hundreds of artists working at it at a given time. So that's that's

878
00:47:24,134 --> 00:47:28,537
kind of the breakdown for our environment team and that kind of scales across all of it. That's

879
00:47:28,537 --> 00:47:32,739
our largest team but it scales across the other teams. Okay there was a question about how much

880
00:47:32,739 --> 00:47:35,742
of all this 3D scanning have in the pipeline?

881
00:47:37,124 --> 00:47:40,385
So we leverage it heavily.

882
00:47:40,385 --> 00:47:41,665
So we do two things.

883
00:47:41,665 --> 00:47:44,846
We laser scan, which is where you put a device down

884
00:47:44,846 --> 00:47:50,387
and you scan in 360 degrees, and then you use that laser scan.

885
00:47:50,387 --> 00:47:52,408
We actually use it as a base.

886
00:47:52,408 --> 00:47:54,068
We'll break it into multiple pieces,

887
00:47:54,068 --> 00:47:56,449
and we'll send that laser scan to our vendors.

888
00:47:56,449 --> 00:47:58,790
And they'll use it as reference when they're

889
00:47:58,790 --> 00:48:01,130
building out the actual asset.

890
00:48:01,130 --> 00:48:03,591
We also heavily leverage photogrammetry.

891
00:48:03,591 --> 00:48:05,311
The more we've learned about photogrammetry,

892
00:48:05,311 --> 00:48:06,232
the more we use it.

893
00:48:06,648 --> 00:48:16,295
And so now a great deal of our environments are our prop assets are actually built with photogrammetry. So that's not laser scan but it's it's photo scan.

894
00:48:16,295 --> 00:48:21,179
And so, a good deal of our assets are built out that way.

895
00:48:21,179 --> 00:48:28,585
I'm a technical question. How do you handle calling. How difficult is it to make the collision.

896
00:48:29,696 --> 00:48:36,063
Yeah, both of those are good questions. So we use a visibility system for culling that says

897
00:48:36,063 --> 00:48:42,089
because we know you were on a racetrack, we have a camera follow a spline through our racetrack,

898
00:48:42,089 --> 00:48:48,155
and we basically set a pixel limit. So we say anything that's lower than this threshold,

899
00:48:48,155 --> 00:48:50,978
say six pixels or three pixels, doesn't get drawn.

900
00:48:51,475 --> 00:49:00,061
And so we've what we found is that we balance the amount that we feel like we can we can set that number to without objects popping in.

901
00:49:00,061 --> 00:49:09,748
And so we drive around the track the camera sees what it sees and then it automatically calls out any of the objects that it didn't see from that particular area.

902
00:49:09,748 --> 00:49:17,674
And sometimes we'll have to go in and say, you know this object popped into later popped into early and we'll have to hand adjust that.

903
00:49:18,465 --> 00:49:23,027
But that's how we call out objects is with this camera based system.

904
00:49:23,027 --> 00:49:25,988
And sorry, what was the other question?

905
00:49:25,988 --> 00:49:29,288
Well, just had to do with collision and culling.

906
00:49:29,288 --> 00:49:33,830
Oh, so for collision, so we built, we just build our collision from the visual mesh.

907
00:49:33,830 --> 00:49:39,911
So often we'll loft out something like our road and our shoulders and our barriers,

908
00:49:39,911 --> 00:49:44,653
and then we'll duplicate that mesh and use that mesh as our collision plane.

909
00:49:46,212 --> 00:49:48,772
Have you ever made an underground track?

910
00:49:48,772 --> 00:50:08,818
The closest we've made is tunnels, small tunnels, but we've never made a completely underground track, but we always talk about that. I think underground on the moon and under the ocean come up pretty often, but I feel like that's not likely, not in our future.

911
00:50:08,818 --> 00:50:09,838
All right.

912
00:50:11,338 --> 00:50:12,179
This was interesting.

913
00:50:12,179 --> 00:50:13,620
Have you ever thought of using design

914
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:16,441
to make it more challenging, like a giant billboard

915
00:50:16,441 --> 00:50:16,662
to distract?

916
00:50:16,662 --> 00:50:17,862
Visual design.

917
00:50:17,862 --> 00:50:19,203
We don't usually.

918
00:50:19,203 --> 00:50:26,147
We spend a lot of time trying to make it easier for the player.

919
00:50:26,147 --> 00:50:29,889
So we try to focus most of our efforts,

920
00:50:29,889 --> 00:50:32,071
I would say, in the opposite, to say,

921
00:50:32,071 --> 00:50:35,413
how can we minimize distraction to make it

922
00:50:35,413 --> 00:50:40,796
so that your gameplay experience is as focused as possible?

923
00:50:41,315 --> 00:50:44,638
So no, I would say that we try to avoid that.

924
00:50:44,638 --> 00:50:45,799
Great.

925
00:50:45,799 --> 00:50:51,044
I just saw an interesting question pop up from open world design

926
00:50:51,044 --> 00:50:52,225
versus linear level design.

927
00:50:52,225 --> 00:50:54,408
Any thoughts?

928
00:50:54,408 --> 00:50:58,792
Yeah, so I mean, it comes with its own unique challenges.

929
00:50:58,792 --> 00:51:01,595
And we don't have to think about the open world too often.

930
00:51:01,595 --> 00:51:04,838
But our sister studio, Playground,

931
00:51:04,838 --> 00:51:06,159
has to think about it all the time.

932
00:51:06,983 --> 00:51:09,646
So it definitely comes with its own challenges.

933
00:51:09,646 --> 00:51:11,227
It has its own visibility system

934
00:51:11,227 --> 00:51:13,289
because you can drive anywhere you want in the world.

935
00:51:13,289 --> 00:51:17,112
You have to deal with your own collision issues.

936
00:51:17,112 --> 00:51:20,435
You're not as focused in terms of not knowing

937
00:51:20,435 --> 00:51:21,496
where the player is gonna be.

938
00:51:21,496 --> 00:51:24,339
So it's harder to design moments for.

939
00:51:24,339 --> 00:51:27,081
So what you wind up doing is you wind up drawing

940
00:51:27,081 --> 00:51:30,004
these iconic or creating these iconic set pieces.

941
00:51:30,004 --> 00:51:31,746
So the moments kind of create themselves

942
00:51:31,746 --> 00:51:33,527
no matter where you are in the world.

943
00:51:34,502 --> 00:51:38,864
So no matter which way you're looking, you're sort of seeing an iconic area.

944
00:51:38,864 --> 00:51:46,207
So it's just a very different design challenge. Those guys are really good at it. They do a great job.

945
00:51:46,207 --> 00:51:52,630
But yeah, I mean it's a whole subject in itself really we've talked about it quite a bit, and they both create their own pros and cons.

946
00:51:52,630 --> 00:51:59,073
Let me see how detailed do you make humans how many unique models of humans, do you make in the game.

947
00:52:00,057 --> 00:52:02,299
So that is an interesting question.

948
00:52:02,299 --> 00:52:03,740
Early on, the answer was not very.

949
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:05,522
You saw our crowds, they're pretty terrible.

950
00:52:05,522 --> 00:52:08,145
But the more we've developed,

951
00:52:08,145 --> 00:52:11,108
the more we wanna add storytelling elements,

952
00:52:11,108 --> 00:52:13,971
the more we wanna add that context for the player.

953
00:52:13,971 --> 00:52:17,354
So recently, in Seven, we started to introduce characters.

954
00:52:17,354 --> 00:52:18,996
We were sort of dipping our toe into it.

955
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:23,723
I think more and more, we hired an all new character team.

956
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:27,746
We're starting to focus more on characters, animation, rigging,

957
00:52:27,746 --> 00:52:31,068
creating photorealistic assets using photogrammetry.

958
00:52:31,068 --> 00:52:34,391
So I would say that we're making a much greater investment

959
00:52:34,391 --> 00:52:36,272
in character than we ever have.

960
00:52:36,272 --> 00:52:37,873
But you haven't seen a lot of that

961
00:52:37,873 --> 00:52:39,374
yet in the games that we've created.

962
00:52:39,374 --> 00:52:40,695
We've just started tipping our dough into it.

963
00:52:40,695 --> 00:52:45,519
OK, maybe a couple more here.

964
00:52:45,519 --> 00:52:46,900
So how do you do the clouds in the sky?

965
00:52:48,652 --> 00:53:10,542
So that's interesting. We and we're actually thinking about changing that system. But what we do is we capture a 360 HDR and we capture frames throughout the course of a day. So we'll set up a camera rig that captures in all directions and we'll just take take HDR exposures every say five to 10 minutes over the course of an entire day.

966
00:53:11,117 --> 00:53:28,986
And then we stitch those together using a sort of a vector based system because we don't want to draw frames over the course of a whole day it'd be too much memory. So we use a system to alert between frames, kind of in a vector driven system.

967
00:53:28,986 --> 00:53:37,710
And that produces a 24 hour day night cycle. And then we use that as this sort of almost animated video as a backdrop for our environments.

968
00:53:38,361 --> 00:53:42,562
We're actually moving to a, or we're trying to move towards,

969
00:53:42,562 --> 00:53:44,782
we're still in development, a more dynamic system

970
00:53:44,782 --> 00:53:47,743
that allows three clouds, maybe something more akin

971
00:53:47,743 --> 00:53:49,823
to like Red Dead Redemption, something like that.

972
00:53:49,823 --> 00:53:51,243
But it's sort of early days,

973
00:53:51,243 --> 00:53:55,184
so we're not sure how we're gonna be doing that yet.

974
00:53:55,184 --> 00:53:56,824
Yeah, and a follow-up question to that,

975
00:53:56,824 --> 00:53:58,945
as you were explaining is how does that impact lighting?

976
00:53:58,945 --> 00:54:00,785
Yeah, and that's the trick.

977
00:54:00,785 --> 00:54:03,165
So what we do is we're, because we have to,

978
00:54:03,165 --> 00:54:04,285
because we have these skies,

979
00:54:04,285 --> 00:54:06,786
we're limited in what we can do for lighting.

980
00:54:07,607 --> 00:54:10,649
We are sort of married to whatever we captured.

981
00:54:10,649 --> 00:54:13,911
And that's why we're looking to break away from,

982
00:54:13,911 --> 00:54:16,632
even though visually the impact is high, it's limiting.

983
00:54:16,632 --> 00:54:19,734
And so what we're looking to do is break away

984
00:54:19,734 --> 00:54:25,137
and explore a more dynamic CG centered system

985
00:54:25,137 --> 00:54:29,840
that allows us to light it and the scene at the same time.

986
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:32,522
But the question is, can we get the same level

987
00:54:32,522 --> 00:54:34,663
of visual fidelity and impact with that system

988
00:54:34,663 --> 00:54:35,944
is something we're still iterating on.

989
00:54:35,944 --> 00:54:36,064
Right.

990
00:54:37,855 --> 00:54:41,577
Well, I think that's, um, it's a time for us to wrap up.

991
00:54:41,577 --> 00:54:46,520
I do want to thank Matt again, so much for, uh, giving such a great presentation.

992
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:50,723
I mean, again, the visuals are just stunning and hopefully everyone, you,

993
00:54:50,723 --> 00:54:55,306
you have a much higher appreciation for what it's into, uh, creating

994
00:54:55,306 --> 00:54:58,127
