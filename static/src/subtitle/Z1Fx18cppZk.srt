00:00:07,473 --> 00:00:12,157
Hello and welcome to the GoldenEye 007 Postmortem.

2
00:00:12,157 --> 00:00:19,203
First I'd like to present my credentials.

3
00:00:19,203 --> 00:00:24,607
I started making games when I was 12 on the 8-bit BBC microcomputer.

4
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:32,234
This was as a hobbyist and I would write in to magazines with games

5
00:00:32,234 --> 00:00:34,235
and they would print them for people to type in.

6
00:00:35,817 --> 00:00:37,758
which is fairly incredible today,

7
00:00:37,758 --> 00:00:41,239
but a good way to learn programming.

8
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:46,942
After university, I was lucky enough to get a job at Rare

9
00:00:46,942 --> 00:00:50,803
as a, first placed as a programmer on Killer Instinct.

10
00:00:50,803 --> 00:00:56,705
This was a very hectic, short,

11
00:00:56,705 --> 00:01:00,987
by my standards, project of one year.

12
00:01:00,987 --> 00:01:03,888
We had to bring an operating system

13
00:01:03,888 --> 00:01:04,028
on a.

14
00:01:05,145 --> 00:01:10,647
new computer essentially was designed inside Rare by Chris Stamper

15
00:01:10,647 --> 00:01:14,608
and Pete Cox from the ground up.

16
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:17,989
It was a thrilling project. After this

17
00:01:17,989 --> 00:01:23,991
I was twiddling my thumbs in the stable block where the Killer Instinct team was

18
00:01:23,991 --> 00:01:26,132
working wondering

19
00:01:26,132 --> 00:01:27,712
what I'd be doing next.

20
00:01:33,269 --> 00:01:40,652
My most important credential is this video that I made when I was a child.

21
00:02:07,509 --> 00:02:13,812
Thank you. I'm very proud of that. And full credit where credit's due, that was a team

22
00:02:13,812 --> 00:02:22,796
effort with me and my two brothers. My youngest was actually the star. I never felt most comfortable

23
00:02:22,796 --> 00:02:32,940
in front of the camera. I was on piano. And my middle brother was pulling down the gel.

24
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:39,251
So, you know, it's an example of how you need to pull together

25
00:02:39,251 --> 00:02:43,033
several technical effects to achieve the desired result.

26
00:02:43,033 --> 00:02:51,658
Now, the beginning of Goldeneye is a bit of a strange story.

27
00:02:51,658 --> 00:02:56,161
As I understand it, Rare was approached by Nintendo

28
00:02:56,161 --> 00:03:00,283
and asked if they would be interested in making a game

29
00:03:00,283 --> 00:03:01,543
for the upcoming Bond film.

30
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,829
which didn't have a title at that time, only a number.

31
00:03:04,829 --> 00:03:11,950
And I assume there was some miscommunication,

32
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:16,011
or at least it was a gray area.

33
00:03:16,011 --> 00:03:22,212
At that time, there were essentially two large teams at Rare.

34
00:03:22,212 --> 00:03:27,573
One had finished Donkey Kong Country recently,

35
00:03:27,573 --> 00:03:29,593
about 18 people,

36
00:03:29,593 --> 00:03:31,953
and the other had finished Killer Instinct Coin.

37
00:03:32,684 --> 00:03:34,845
that was about 10, maybe 11 people.

38
00:03:34,845 --> 00:03:38,366
There was a little bit of competitive spirit

39
00:03:38,366 --> 00:03:41,226
between these two teams, but Tim Stamper,

40
00:03:41,226 --> 00:03:43,327
who was one of the directors of the company,

41
00:03:43,327 --> 00:03:47,788
was very much on the Donkey Kong Country team,

42
00:03:47,788 --> 00:03:51,409
and that was his brainchild, that game.

43
00:03:51,409 --> 00:03:54,610
And he went down to,

44
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,410
he went down to Leavesden,

45
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,051
where the film was going to be shot for a,

46
00:03:59,798 --> 00:04:05,239
press junket, they were promoting the new film, all the big stars were there.

47
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:08,600
I didn't know anything about this at the time.

48
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:14,061
Here's a scan from some of the subsequent publicity

49
00:04:14,061 --> 00:04:21,243
from that visit, and here is a picture, very rare I have to say, a photograph of

50
00:04:21,243 --> 00:04:25,884
Tim Stamper, who also was keen to keep out of the

51
00:04:25,884 --> 00:04:27,704
limelight. On the left here...

52
00:04:28,793 --> 00:04:32,737
with the art director of Goldeneye, Andrew Ackland Snow.

53
00:04:32,737 --> 00:04:35,019
Goldeneye the movie, this is.

54
00:04:35,019 --> 00:04:38,923
And it says, I don't know if you can see this,

55
00:04:38,923 --> 00:04:43,267
Tim Stamper, who will design the Super NES game.

56
00:04:43,267 --> 00:04:47,310
Here's a photograph inside Rare

57
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:52,935
with the very large supercomputer called Challenger.

58
00:04:52,935 --> 00:04:54,937
In the end, it was 20 processors.

59
00:04:55,783 --> 00:05:00,584
It was awesome in that it could do a great amount of rendering,

60
00:05:00,584 --> 00:05:03,685
but not so good in that I had to reboot it every day,

61
00:05:03,685 --> 00:05:07,407
or sometimes even three times a day.

62
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:12,928
So this is kind of a funny start.

63
00:05:12,928 --> 00:05:15,989
Tim Stamper decided not to make the film.

64
00:05:15,989 --> 00:05:21,031
Greg Mayles on Donkey Kong Country, who's, I guess you

65
00:05:21,031 --> 00:05:24,132
would say, lead designer.

66
00:05:24,878 --> 00:05:28,442
on Donkey Kong Country, wasn't that impressed,

67
00:05:28,442 --> 00:05:30,063
so they decided to pass.

68
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:33,627
I heard about this as a rumor,

69
00:05:33,627 --> 00:05:36,690
and I said to Tim Stamper,

70
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:41,294
this sounds cool, I'd like to make this game.

71
00:05:41,294 --> 00:05:46,179
And he said okay, and that was pretty much my pitch.

72
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:59,033
I don't really know and I can't really explain why they had trust in me after simply being

73
00:05:59,033 --> 00:06:05,615
second programmer on Killer Instinct. But I'm delighted and honored that they did.

74
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:16,879
At that time I was beginning to be involved in the hiring and I hired my first ever interviewee

75
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:20,200
was Mark Edmonds. This was January...

76
00:06:21,227 --> 00:06:32,713
1995. And he's someone you don't hear too much about from the GoldenEye team.

77
00:06:32,713 --> 00:06:35,195
I don't know if you ever have noticed

78
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:42,039
the weird thing that happens on one of the screens, which is a very tall person

79
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:42,879
walking like this.

80
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:46,281
You can just about make it out.

81
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:50,883
That's the only presence of Mark Edmonds in the game.

82
00:06:51,633 --> 00:06:54,814
Most of the team members were in the game,

83
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:57,876
myself included, were in the game as a face

84
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:02,078
on one of the characters that would be randomly generated

85
00:07:02,078 --> 00:07:05,199
or that was scripted, but Mark preferred not to be.

86
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:11,162
So in the course of putting together my talk,

87
00:07:11,162 --> 00:07:15,304
I asked all of the Goldeneye team

88
00:07:15,304 --> 00:07:21,267
if they had anything to say about the making of Goldeneye.

89
00:07:21,931 --> 00:07:24,712
I had great pleasure talking to each of them.

90
00:07:24,712 --> 00:07:32,674
Mark, I asked, the first question I asked him was,

91
00:07:32,674 --> 00:07:35,595
what was it like working at Rare?

92
00:07:35,595 --> 00:07:37,955
And he was a very quiet, humble guy,

93
00:07:37,955 --> 00:07:41,296
and he said this in the nicest possible way.

94
00:07:41,296 --> 00:07:44,977
He said it was work, lunch, work, supper,

95
00:07:44,977 --> 00:07:48,038
play games for a bit, work, sleep, repeat.

96
00:07:49,292 --> 00:07:58,258
And for Mark and myself, it was a two-year, eight-month project,

97
00:07:58,258 --> 00:08:01,720
and about a thousand days, and it was a long project.

98
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:08,785
In the beginning, we were probably working ten hours a day,

99
00:08:08,785 --> 00:08:12,528
but by the end, far in excess of that.

100
00:08:12,528 --> 00:08:17,851
There was no such thing as an N64.

101
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:21,074
The name before was Ultra 64.

102
00:08:21,074 --> 00:08:25,177
And the name before that was Project Reality, but

103
00:08:25,177 --> 00:08:29,101
circa the beginning of this project,

104
00:08:29,101 --> 00:08:31,743
it was called the Ultra 64.

105
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:37,047
And the closest thing to it was this Onyx,

106
00:08:37,047 --> 00:08:41,371
Silicon Graphics Onyx, which I think the list price

107
00:08:41,371 --> 00:08:41,551
was about $150,000.

108
00:08:41,551 --> 00:08:45,054
This is, you can see, it's a very large box.

109
00:08:45,054 --> 00:08:47,656
It wouldn't fit under every desk.

110
00:08:48,867 --> 00:08:52,268
and it emitted huge amounts of heat for graphics cards

111
00:08:52,268 --> 00:08:55,489
and it was not that reliable, frankly,

112
00:08:55,489 --> 00:08:56,950
like all the SGI machines.

113
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:00,292
If you pay that much money for something,

114
00:09:00,292 --> 00:09:02,913
it's not going to be all that reliable.

115
00:09:02,913 --> 00:09:07,155
And this was Mark's computer,

116
00:09:07,155 --> 00:09:09,856
and he set about, at the beginning,

117
00:09:09,856 --> 00:09:13,157
working on the pipeline for the game,

118
00:09:13,157 --> 00:09:15,878
trying to get a character on screen.

119
00:09:17,284 --> 00:09:22,107
trying to make do with what we knew it wasn't going to be able to do very many polygons

120
00:09:22,107 --> 00:09:24,669
and we wanted lots of characters on screen.

121
00:09:24,669 --> 00:09:29,693
So trying to make a character, four-sided arms, guru shading.

122
00:09:29,693 --> 00:09:34,396
That was the first piece of graphics I ever saw on, you know,

123
00:09:34,396 --> 00:09:36,297
grey shaded, no texture, no artist.

124
00:09:42,037 --> 00:09:46,479
One of the major themes I want to pull out from this

125
00:09:46,479 --> 00:09:48,120
that I was thinking about a lot

126
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,681
when I was putting this together

127
00:09:49,681 --> 00:09:56,124
was to what extent does it make sense

128
00:09:56,124 --> 00:10:00,167
to talk about a game or making a game

129
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:03,989
as an endeavor led by one person?

130
00:10:03,989 --> 00:10:06,690
I find this a very interesting question.

131
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,832
I'm in love with movies.

132
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:19,792
as well as games obviously, but I love movies and I consider myself a film buff and

133
00:10:19,792 --> 00:10:26,714
from the French critical theory around the time of Truffaut etc, they had this idea of

134
00:10:26,714 --> 00:10:35,316
auteur theory, which is the idea that there was one author of the work and that was François Truffaut

135
00:10:35,316 --> 00:10:37,236
or whatever.

136
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:41,841
we looked at films perhaps too often,

137
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:45,144
films were looking to games, films were looking to books,

138
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:50,389
and this was the idea that an author wrote a book.

139
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:54,712
And no tour is my way of saying,

140
00:10:54,712 --> 00:10:57,595
well, maybe it's not like that at all.

141
00:10:57,595 --> 00:11:02,119
Maybe it's a totally collaborative process

142
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:04,701
when it works well, and there's no,

143
00:11:06,445 --> 00:11:10,107
one authority and there's no one author.

144
00:11:10,107 --> 00:11:12,548
So this is one of the things I want to pull out.

145
00:11:12,548 --> 00:11:18,110
Recently I found some paper from the GoldenEye project.

146
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,471
I originally thought I had nothing,

147
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:23,753
but I'm gonna show you for the first time,

148
00:11:23,753 --> 00:11:28,475
about 10 pages of very, very early documents

149
00:11:28,475 --> 00:11:33,397
that I put together, which are all the materials that I have.

150
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:36,761
This is my jottings.

151
00:11:36,761 --> 00:11:38,822
The date on this can't be right.

152
00:11:38,822 --> 00:11:40,503
It says 94, it must be 95.

153
00:11:40,503 --> 00:11:46,928
February 95, and I was wondering to myself,

154
00:11:46,928 --> 00:11:52,132
the two, I think, two very important questions

155
00:11:52,132 --> 00:11:56,495
for this game, what's the appropriate level of humor,

156
00:11:56,495 --> 00:11:59,437
and what's the appropriate level of violence?

157
00:11:59,437 --> 00:12:02,860
This is a list of questions, mainly.

158
00:12:04,789 --> 00:12:08,130
which is a good start to any project, I suppose.

159
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:12,292
Can we get footage? Can we use the actual music?

160
00:12:12,292 --> 00:12:17,434
Can we use the title sequence? Can we use the likenesses?

161
00:12:17,434 --> 00:12:19,975
Can we use material from other Bond films?

162
00:12:19,975 --> 00:12:22,156
Can we get photos of props, costumes, etc.? A bit of a list.

163
00:12:22,156 --> 00:12:23,736
So I was wondering all this.

164
00:12:23,736 --> 00:12:26,698
Actually, in a communication, I made this clear to Nintendo

165
00:12:26,698 --> 00:12:31,279
when they were good enough to send back an extremely detailed document

166
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,540
explaining everything we could use,

167
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:33,900
which...

168
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:36,511
was an astonishing amount.

169
00:12:36,511 --> 00:12:39,593
We're very lucky to have such a broad license.

170
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:47,878
So these are my thoughts at the same time.

171
00:12:47,878 --> 00:12:51,100
In my mind was Virtual Cop and Doom on the Ultra 64,

172
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,561
as it was called.

173
00:12:53,561 --> 00:12:56,443
No gun, I'd also been playing a lot of Time Crisis

174
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:58,304
and together with Mark,

175
00:12:58,304 --> 00:13:02,306
and I could see the value of having a gun in your hand,

176
00:13:02,306 --> 00:13:02,527
but.

177
00:13:03,228 --> 00:13:05,949
There was no gun planned for the N64.

178
00:13:05,949 --> 00:13:15,153
At this time we had no controller or no idea what the controller would be like at all.

179
00:13:15,153 --> 00:13:15,433
So there was no...

180
00:13:15,433 --> 00:13:20,536
there was no certainty, but there was a rumor

181
00:13:20,536 --> 00:13:25,078
that there was going to be a analog stick.

182
00:13:25,078 --> 00:13:26,559
And that was all I knew.

183
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:31,541
I was pondering would the analog joypad be okay?

184
00:13:32,755 --> 00:13:34,215
Is it okay to shoot lots of people?

185
00:13:34,215 --> 00:13:36,015
I don't think I actually put that question

186
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:39,976
to management or to Nintendo.

187
00:13:39,976 --> 00:13:42,757
If I had, they probably said no.

188
00:13:42,757 --> 00:13:47,458
It was very much in my mind that Bond wasn't,

189
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:51,158
I mean, he does kill people, he does have a license to kill,

190
00:13:51,158 --> 00:13:53,899
but it's not a gore fest,

191
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:58,380
it's not an incredibly violent game.

192
00:13:59,009 --> 00:14:01,490
It's not an incredibly violent universe.

193
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:03,331
So this is very much in my mind.

194
00:14:03,331 --> 00:14:06,413
Talking here about Street Fighter is less violent

195
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:10,054
than Virtual Cop, which is less violent than Doom,

196
00:14:10,054 --> 00:14:11,915
which is less violent than Pulp Fiction.

197
00:14:11,915 --> 00:14:16,417
Isn't Adventure Aspect a good idea?

198
00:14:16,417 --> 00:14:18,658
Gets the camera route fixed.

199
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:19,679
Model destruction's crucial.

200
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:21,960
Character motions be fixed.

201
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,361
Can we use the likeness of Pierce Brosnan?

202
00:14:24,361 --> 00:14:27,763
Maybe two-player cooperative would be a good idea.

203
00:14:28,513 --> 00:14:31,714
Legal, can we use the wall for PPK?

204
00:14:31,714 --> 00:14:35,476
And down the bottom, I'm starting to talk about the schedule.

205
00:14:35,476 --> 00:14:40,279
Is it one programmer, two artists, two other artists?

206
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:43,741
I was very much thinking of a small number of programmers

207
00:14:43,741 --> 00:14:45,782
and a large number of artists.

208
00:14:45,782 --> 00:14:49,203
Controls, aim, shoot, dive, left, right, advanced, retreat.

209
00:14:49,203 --> 00:14:51,545
These were all ideas.

210
00:14:51,545 --> 00:14:56,807
And then Tim asked me to produce a formal document.

211
00:14:57,167 --> 00:15:01,748
so that I could show the management at Rare what I was thinking.

212
00:15:01,748 --> 00:15:03,869
So I produced this.

213
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:06,290
This is April 1995, a couple of months later.

214
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:12,492
Slightly drawing back my scope, focusing more on Virtual Cop,

215
00:15:12,492 --> 00:15:17,373
which is obviously a simpler game to make.

216
00:15:17,373 --> 00:15:18,854
Large number of character types,

217
00:15:18,854 --> 00:15:22,175
more moves in Virtual Cop for each character.

218
00:15:22,175 --> 00:15:24,536
This was all comparing it to Virtual Cop.

219
00:15:25,409 --> 00:15:30,233
More intelligent characters, this is where it starts to diverge.

220
00:15:30,233 --> 00:15:32,195
So this is

221
00:15:32,195 --> 00:15:36,939
suggesting that we spend much more effort on the artificial intelligence.

222
00:15:36,939 --> 00:15:42,624
All characters will try to survive, but in addition

223
00:15:42,624 --> 00:15:46,568
they might be trying to reach an alarm switch, rescue their comrade,

224
00:15:46,568 --> 00:15:50,711
obey an order, play dead, hide under a table,

225
00:15:50,711 --> 00:15:51,752
or reach an exit.

226
00:15:52,349 --> 00:15:54,611
Wouldn't it be awesome if a character tried to hide

227
00:15:54,611 --> 00:15:56,413
under a table in a first-person shoot?

228
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:59,455
I've never seen that yet.

229
00:15:59,455 --> 00:16:02,338
Large range of objects, more uses for each object,

230
00:16:02,338 --> 00:16:04,179
more interesting 3D backgrounds.

231
00:16:04,179 --> 00:16:09,884
You know, already I kind of had the thought of missions,

232
00:16:09,884 --> 00:16:12,787
it fits so well in with Bond,

233
00:16:12,787 --> 00:16:15,729
but not the idea of five per level or anything like that.

234
00:16:15,729 --> 00:16:19,292
Talking about more and less covert missions.

235
00:16:19,805 --> 00:16:23,486
You're bondstorming a train or escape from a building with unsilenced weapons

236
00:16:23,486 --> 00:16:26,347
against stiffer opposition.

237
00:16:26,347 --> 00:16:30,249
The violence will be low-key, I say down the bottom.

238
00:16:30,249 --> 00:16:33,390
Gratuitous behavior will not be encouraged.

239
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:37,952
Control, you know, you can't really say too much about this,

240
00:16:37,952 --> 00:16:43,174
this whole paragraph. Maybe it'll be like this, maybe it'll be like that.

241
00:16:43,174 --> 00:16:46,615
We didn't have hardware, we didn't know.

242
00:16:46,615 --> 00:16:47,275
Realism.

243
00:16:50,237 --> 00:16:52,597
I knew that it shouldn't be totally realistic.

244
00:16:52,597 --> 00:16:56,479
It had to feel a little bit realistic,

245
00:16:56,479 --> 00:16:59,100
but what I had in mind was a kind of film realism,

246
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,981
which is a silly realism on the surface.

247
00:17:01,981 --> 00:17:06,803
It looks real, but it's got bizarre rules,

248
00:17:06,803 --> 00:17:10,744
like cars explode the instant you tap against someone,

249
00:17:10,744 --> 00:17:14,846
or all the enemies have awful aim,

250
00:17:14,846 --> 00:17:19,367
which is the famous thing, the stormtroopers.

251
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:26,444
So I had this kind of idea of filmic realism, film physics.

252
00:17:26,444 --> 00:17:31,227
Bullets leaving their mark on the walls around the level.

253
00:17:31,227 --> 00:17:33,628
I think that that level of interactivity,

254
00:17:33,628 --> 00:17:36,370
pretty much all you have is the gun.

255
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:37,971
And the more the gun can do

256
00:17:37,971 --> 00:17:41,233
and reach out to the environment and feedback to you

257
00:17:41,233 --> 00:17:42,194
that stuff is happening, the better.

258
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:45,596
Multiplayer option, I was talking about a link

259
00:17:45,596 --> 00:17:46,776
out between two consoles.

260
00:17:47,238 --> 00:17:50,619
Thank goodness we didn't do that in the end.

261
00:17:50,619 --> 00:17:55,161
So this is a list of levels, which is kind of two-thirds how it came out.

262
00:17:55,161 --> 00:18:03,025
We had, actually, we put Dam not as the second level, as the first level in the end.

263
00:18:03,025 --> 00:18:07,426
We had Sevenaya twice, as I thought.

264
00:18:07,426 --> 00:18:10,408
That worked out.

265
00:18:10,408 --> 00:18:15,150
Arethebo, I wrote six levels here at the end, Arethebo.

266
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,421
So I guess I wanted there to be a goodly number of levels,

267
00:18:19,421 --> 00:18:22,602
but I didn't feel there was quite enough material in the film.

268
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:29,883
So I was trying to pull out more and more from the film

269
00:18:29,883 --> 00:18:34,705
to make a substantial game.

270
00:18:34,705 --> 00:18:38,025
Here I'm talking through the possibility

271
00:18:38,025 --> 00:18:40,806
of the missions on each level.

272
00:18:47,613 --> 00:18:52,035
I listed the weapons and looking back,

273
00:18:52,035 --> 00:18:56,318
this is very naive, this list, because it's so ambitious.

274
00:18:56,318 --> 00:19:01,401
You know, I've got a sniper's rifle with a sight

275
00:19:01,401 --> 00:19:06,424
in this list and the game wasn't supposed to take

276
00:19:06,424 --> 00:19:08,845
nearly three years to make.

277
00:19:08,845 --> 00:19:16,110
But you can already see the degree of ambition

278
00:19:17,687 --> 00:19:24,832
within me and also within the team in this document.

279
00:19:24,832 --> 00:19:26,133
All right, various gadgets, M, Q.

280
00:19:26,133 --> 00:19:29,916
Wouldn't it have been great to have money, penny?

281
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:32,017
It was not to be.

282
00:19:32,017 --> 00:19:35,720
Now this is an interesting list.

283
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,383
This is visual effects, which I felt it was fit

284
00:19:39,383 --> 00:19:41,424
to dedicate a page to in this short document.

285
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:49,145
muzzle flashes, ricochets, cartridge cases ejected from guns, wounds,

286
00:19:49,145 --> 00:19:57,772
sparks from huge equipment, flames, smoke, day and night, gas escaping, sea and lake effects,

287
00:19:57,772 --> 00:20:08,381
mirror and glass reflections. Again, really quite ambitious for what was supposed to be a short project.

288
00:20:08,381 --> 00:20:08,481
So

289
00:20:09,064 --> 00:20:12,885
In terms of materials from the film, we had very little to begin with.

290
00:20:12,885 --> 00:20:15,926
We had an early shooting script,

291
00:20:15,926 --> 00:20:18,087
which was lovely to thumb through,

292
00:20:18,087 --> 00:20:22,589
and it gave us a lot of information about what they were planning in the film,

293
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:26,370
but we didn't know what they were actually going to shoot.

294
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:30,311
Before too long, we were informed of their shooting schedule,

295
00:20:30,311 --> 00:20:35,913
and we were invited to go along to collect photographic material.

296
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,141
and this is our copy of the document they sent.

297
00:20:40,141 --> 00:20:44,502
You can see I put a question mark on Statue Park there,

298
00:20:44,502 --> 00:20:48,863
wondering if it was going to make it as a level

299
00:20:48,863 --> 00:20:50,724
and if it was worth a visit to the film set,

300
00:20:50,724 --> 00:20:54,565
but all of us were very privileged to be offered

301
00:20:54,565 --> 00:20:59,126
to go and see the film set and see it photographed,

302
00:20:59,126 --> 00:21:02,927
which perhaps the director, Martin Campbell,

303
00:21:02,927 --> 00:21:05,107
might've preferred to have a quieter set,

304
00:21:05,107 --> 00:21:05,367
but.

305
00:21:06,157 --> 00:21:12,501
It was a great honor, it was an enormous pleasure and it was an enormous help to making the game so closely follow the film.

306
00:21:12,501 --> 00:21:16,444
So the next hire to the team was Carl Hilton.

307
00:21:16,444 --> 00:21:17,865
And Carl said to me,

308
00:21:17,865 --> 00:21:27,952
it was great to go down to the sets at Leavesden and take photos of all the different locations.

309
00:21:27,952 --> 00:21:29,372
He also was a Bond fan.

310
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:32,315
Almost all the team, we were all Bond fans.

311
00:21:32,315 --> 00:21:35,176
It was a selection effect.

312
00:21:36,552 --> 00:21:43,517
So it was a project that personally interested all of us.

313
00:21:43,517 --> 00:21:46,259
And at the end here, he said to me,

314
00:21:46,259 --> 00:21:47,540
32 by 32 RGB, 64 by 64 int.

315
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:53,704
The N64 did not have a large texture cache,

316
00:21:53,704 --> 00:21:57,547
and one of Carl's bugbears,

317
00:21:57,547 --> 00:21:59,249
and one of his very tight constraints

318
00:21:59,249 --> 00:22:01,550
was the size of the textures he had to make.

319
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:05,173
And most of the textures were 32 by 32.

320
00:22:06,042 --> 00:22:08,522
many of them could be as large as 64 by 64.

321
00:22:08,522 --> 00:22:09,882
And now, nowadays,

322
00:22:09,882 --> 00:22:12,403
I've never actually seen,

323
00:22:12,403 --> 00:22:18,764
but I'm sure there's textures that are 12 megabytes,

324
00:22:18,764 --> 00:22:23,865
which is as large as the whole ROM on Goldeneye.

325
00:22:23,865 --> 00:22:27,906
Nowadays, the smallest iPod you get is two gigabytes,

326
00:22:27,906 --> 00:22:32,887
which is 100 more times larger

327
00:22:32,887 --> 00:22:35,428
than the entire Goldeneye ROM.

328
00:22:36,723 --> 00:22:39,664
So people have very strict constraints to work to.

329
00:22:39,664 --> 00:22:42,765
This is Carl as a scientist being shot for no reason.

330
00:22:42,765 --> 00:22:47,126
And you can see the texture in the background,

331
00:22:47,126 --> 00:22:51,947
there's really not that many pixels there.

332
00:22:51,947 --> 00:22:56,328
So Carl was good enough to send me some of his artwork

333
00:22:56,328 --> 00:22:56,889
that was from his desk.

334
00:23:07,312 --> 00:23:15,414
It's funny how relaxed we were.

335
00:23:15,414 --> 00:23:23,776
This is his list of what levels were definite.

336
00:23:23,776 --> 00:23:30,138
He's written here again another texture size and another one at the top, 64 by 13.

337
00:23:30,138 --> 00:23:32,679
You can tell what was on his mind.

338
00:23:34,063 --> 00:23:38,064
This is his plan for Silo version 1 at the bottom here.

339
00:23:38,064 --> 00:23:45,167
That's the level with the tall towers and was one of the very first levels that was modelled.

340
00:23:45,167 --> 00:23:50,589
We actually showed that at Shishinkai on video only form with a mock-up.

341
00:23:50,589 --> 00:23:56,151
It wasn't a playable game at all, it was a mock-up with handcrafted camera splines.

342
00:23:56,151 --> 00:24:00,992
And then all the audio was added in afterwards.

343
00:24:03,036 --> 00:24:10,097
So that's a more modern, reverse-engineered

344
00:24:10,097 --> 00:24:12,038
image of the silo level.

345
00:24:12,038 --> 00:24:21,120
That's not contemporary, just to give you an idea.

346
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:31,102
This is Carl adding out some of his textures.

347
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:32,002
Now,

348
00:24:33,699 --> 00:24:39,363
As we got through the levels, we got a little bit more sophisticated.

349
00:24:39,363 --> 00:24:43,406
This is St. Petersburg version 3 on the right here.

350
00:24:43,406 --> 00:24:48,069
But really, as Karl put it, it's not the art of Prometheus.

351
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:50,771
You couldn't put this together in a coffee table book.

352
00:24:50,771 --> 00:24:55,814
But this is pretty much all the paper that we used

353
00:24:55,814 --> 00:24:57,596
during the development of the game.

354
00:24:57,596 --> 00:24:58,877
Really what we're focusing on...

355
00:24:59,196 --> 00:25:04,559
was the tools on the SGI machines that we had,

356
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,640
looking at the screen there,

357
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,702
resizing the window down to 320, 240

358
00:25:08,702 --> 00:25:19,508
to try and simulate what the Ultra 64 would be like.

359
00:25:19,508 --> 00:25:25,271
Bea Jones was the next hire.

360
00:25:25,271 --> 00:25:28,593
She was an artist and,

361
00:25:28,917 --> 00:25:33,681
was responsible for many things, but chiefly all the characters.

362
00:25:33,681 --> 00:25:37,403
I asked her, you know, what was the work you did that you're most proud of?

363
00:25:37,403 --> 00:25:41,406
And this is a bit of a tease, but the answer was

364
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:46,530
building the four James Bonds. Each one was different.

365
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:50,413
Roger has a white tux, Sean had a double-breasted jacket,

366
00:25:50,413 --> 00:25:55,056
and Tim had an open tux. I was very pleased with the likenesses,

367
00:25:55,056 --> 00:25:58,118
but I guess you'll just have to believe me.

368
00:26:00,182 --> 00:26:00,642
Sorry about that.

369
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:03,504
This is another piece of work that Bea did,

370
00:26:03,504 --> 00:26:09,086
which was for the promotion of the game.

371
00:26:09,086 --> 00:26:11,587
This was done actually once the game was finished

372
00:26:11,587 --> 00:26:15,369
and she had a little bit more free time.

373
00:26:15,369 --> 00:26:22,572
First designer on the project was Duncan Botwood.

374
00:26:22,572 --> 00:26:24,553
He said to me that he was most proud of the multiplayer mode.

375
00:26:24,553 --> 00:26:28,595
Steve coded it in a month, which was the work of a magician.

376
00:26:29,761 --> 00:26:33,024
while I set up the spawning, weapon, and ammo points.

377
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:34,445
This is Duncan talking.

378
00:26:34,445 --> 00:26:35,866
And cut the level backgrounds down

379
00:26:35,866 --> 00:26:36,947
to a quarter of their polycount.

380
00:26:36,947 --> 00:26:39,008
Then made new backgrounds

381
00:26:39,008 --> 00:26:40,750
when we didn't have enough variety.

382
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:43,592
Carl contributed some fantastically complex environments

383
00:26:43,592 --> 00:26:46,194
as well, which meant I had to go back

384
00:26:46,194 --> 00:26:48,716
and do better texturing on the ones I'd made.

385
00:26:48,716 --> 00:26:53,379
You know, on a small team like this,

386
00:26:53,379 --> 00:26:55,981
there's so many jobs, it's impossible to explain

387
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:59,364
what each person did comprehensively.

388
00:27:01,087 --> 00:27:03,869
So I can only give you a tiny indication in a one hour talk.

389
00:27:03,869 --> 00:27:10,192
Steve Ellis was the mentioned programmer

390
00:27:10,192 --> 00:27:13,514
who did the multiplayer and many other things.

391
00:27:13,514 --> 00:27:16,696
He said, one of the things that always strikes me as crazy

392
00:27:16,696 --> 00:27:21,219
in retrospect is until sometime like March or April of 1997.

393
00:27:21,219 --> 00:27:23,900
So that's two years after we'd begun.

394
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,422
There wasn't a multiplayer mode at all.

395
00:27:26,422 --> 00:27:27,842
It hadn't even been started.

396
00:27:27,842 --> 00:27:29,763
It really was put in at the last minute.

397
00:27:30,308 --> 00:27:34,770
something you wouldn't dream of doing these days.

398
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:37,232
And it was done without the knowledge or permission

399
00:27:37,232 --> 00:27:39,192
of the management at Rare and Nintendo.

400
00:27:39,192 --> 00:27:40,013
Sorry.

401
00:27:40,013 --> 00:27:43,014
Management at Rare and Nintendo.

402
00:27:43,014 --> 00:27:45,455
The first thing they knew about it

403
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:47,796
was when we showed it to them working.

404
00:27:47,796 --> 00:27:50,237
However, since the game was already late by that time,

405
00:27:50,237 --> 00:27:51,358
if we hadn't done it that way,

406
00:27:51,358 --> 00:27:52,839
it probably would never have happened.

407
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:57,280
And I suppose there's quite a few features

408
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,221
that we snuck in.

409
00:27:59,138 --> 00:28:04,782
It was only possible because of the fact that the management trusted us,

410
00:28:04,782 --> 00:28:11,667
they believed in the team, and they weren't coming in even every week.

411
00:28:11,667 --> 00:28:15,169
I'm sure there were six-month stretches

412
00:28:15,169 --> 00:28:20,973
where no member of Rare or Nintendo management came in to the team offices,

413
00:28:20,973 --> 00:28:24,035
which is really quite extraordinary,

414
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:27,997
and all credit to them that they...

415
00:28:28,423 --> 00:28:36,590
felt able to take that much of a lean back approach and place that much trust in a team,

416
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:41,855
all the people on the team had never made a game before.

417
00:28:41,855 --> 00:28:49,842
Except for myself and A.D. Smith.

418
00:28:49,842 --> 00:28:52,204
So a lot of trust there.

419
00:28:54,127 --> 00:28:59,250
Graham Norgate was one of three audio people on the project.

420
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:02,793
Graham was involved for an extremely long stretch

421
00:29:02,793 --> 00:29:06,976
of the project and was responsible for all the sound effects.

422
00:29:06,976 --> 00:29:10,338
One of the fascinating things about the sound

423
00:29:10,338 --> 00:29:13,300
is when you actually shoot in Goldeneye

424
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:16,522
and you hit something, something like seven, eight, or nine,

425
00:29:16,522 --> 00:29:19,284
sound effects will actually trigger.

426
00:29:19,284 --> 00:29:20,685
So much effort was put into the...

427
00:29:21,306 --> 00:29:27,309
various permutations and combinations and the randomness in the sound effects

428
00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:35,414
to try and give a punch and a pleasant tactile sensation

429
00:29:35,414 --> 00:29:41,237
and the reward of yes, I, the game, know you're hitting this,

430
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:44,578
I know you're hitting that, I know you're hitting the other.

431
00:29:44,578 --> 00:29:48,060
So an enormous amount of effort went into polishing, compressing.

432
00:29:48,441 --> 00:29:52,885
iterating, iterating, iterating on those sounds.

433
00:29:52,885 --> 00:29:54,726
And Graham did all of that.

434
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:56,387
But he was also a composer,

435
00:29:56,387 --> 00:29:59,130
and he wrote half of the music,

436
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:02,933
something like 40 or 50 pieces of music in the entire game,

437
00:30:02,933 --> 00:30:05,154
which was an incredible feat,

438
00:30:05,154 --> 00:30:11,259
not least because of the measly budget I gave them

439
00:30:11,259 --> 00:30:13,601
to fit all of the sound effects,

440
00:30:13,601 --> 00:30:15,843
all of the instrument effects,

441
00:30:15,843 --> 00:30:17,725
and all of the MIDI music.

442
00:30:19,042 --> 00:30:32,109
on the wrong. This is the famous David Doak. He was the second and last designer to join

443
00:30:32,109 --> 00:30:40,194
the team. This is him as a scientist. He was unusual. He had a great piece of good luck.

444
00:30:40,194 --> 00:30:46,478
He was actually a biochemist. His PhD was in biochemistry.

445
00:30:47,872 --> 00:30:53,334
I hired him to Rare to actually be a system administrator for Rare.

446
00:30:53,334 --> 00:30:58,716
But after a while, talking to him, we had a great relationship

447
00:30:58,716 --> 00:31:02,678
and I felt that he had been an awesome addition to the team.

448
00:31:02,678 --> 00:31:06,579
And I'm so glad I made that choice.

449
00:31:06,579 --> 00:31:13,062
He was, unquestionably, one of the best FES designers in the world.

450
00:31:13,062 --> 00:31:17,264
This is Dave Doaker, myself, being silly.

451
00:31:18,635 --> 00:31:19,916
The team had to produce...

452
00:31:19,916 --> 00:31:25,840
We scratched for what photographic materials we could get,

453
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,842
but there was very little in the way of faces of the actors,

454
00:31:29,842 --> 00:31:36,387
even the bit parts, even Pierce Brosnan.

455
00:31:36,387 --> 00:31:40,970
So it was like magazines, and we found a picture of Jaws,

456
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:43,492
it was about this big in some magazines,

457
00:31:43,492 --> 00:31:45,433
so yeah, of course, great, we used Jaws.

458
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:50,572
And here we are, we're dressing up to provide silhouettes

459
00:31:50,572 --> 00:31:53,074
for the video screens in 7A, our bunker.

460
00:31:53,074 --> 00:31:55,256
This is actually a later picture from near the end.

461
00:31:55,256 --> 00:32:00,639
What I've got in my hand there is the mock-up of the box art

462
00:32:00,639 --> 00:32:05,482
for the product that was produced by Nintendo.

463
00:32:05,482 --> 00:32:08,885
They sent it to us, we printed it out on one of the few colour printers

464
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,065
in the company,

465
00:32:10,065 --> 00:32:12,887
and I folded it together to make a simulation

466
00:32:12,887 --> 00:32:14,788
of what the box would look like.

467
00:32:17,521 --> 00:32:20,682
One of the things I'd like to talk about in GoldenEye

468
00:32:20,682 --> 00:32:24,984
that I think isn't spoken about enough is the humor.

469
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:28,866
There's a lot of things that happened in there.

470
00:32:28,866 --> 00:32:31,707
Some were intentional, some were not so intentional,

471
00:32:31,707 --> 00:32:36,189
but I think all of them are a great addition to the game

472
00:32:36,189 --> 00:32:38,590
that help to make you laugh.

473
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:43,512
Any first-person shooter and almost any game

474
00:32:43,512 --> 00:32:45,673
is a series of...

475
00:32:46,132 --> 00:32:53,433
hills and valleys of tension. You go around a corner, maybe there's a guy there. Oh, there

476
00:32:53,433 --> 00:33:00,394
isn't. You go around another corner, no guy. Oh, I hear some shooting over there. Come

477
00:33:00,394 --> 00:33:07,215
around a corner, three guys, bang, bang, bang. So that's ramping up the tension, but to bring

478
00:33:07,215 --> 00:33:13,536
it down again, it's more difficult. And humans are incredibly important for that. And that

479
00:33:13,536 --> 00:33:14,037
helps to...

480
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:22,531
bring the valleys in and to make the, to give the level a structure, an emotional structure,

481
00:33:22,531 --> 00:33:33,437
which is really important for people's reward, because people are, at base, emotional animals.

482
00:33:33,437 --> 00:33:41,621
So, you know, it's not really realistic. It was kind of cool.

483
00:33:42,078 --> 00:33:47,661
Very pleased the first time he got the watch to come up on the screen,

484
00:33:47,661 --> 00:33:49,742
but really it's a little bit silly.

485
00:33:49,742 --> 00:33:56,885
And the explosions is another example of humour,

486
00:33:56,885 --> 00:34:00,927
because for reasons I still don't understand,

487
00:34:00,927 --> 00:34:02,127
when there's an explosion,

488
00:34:02,127 --> 00:34:05,729
there's kind of a crediting effect,

489
00:34:05,729 --> 00:34:10,551
and the software credits the momentum to the nearby enemies.

490
00:34:10,895 --> 00:34:14,836
And when it reaches a certain amount, they fly off.

491
00:34:14,836 --> 00:34:18,018
So what happens is, there's an explosion,

492
00:34:18,018 --> 00:34:19,959
people are there like this,

493
00:34:19,959 --> 00:34:23,120
slightly too long, and then they fly off into the air.

494
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,301
And it is very, very funny.

495
00:34:25,301 --> 00:34:27,162
And I personally, by rights,

496
00:34:27,162 --> 00:34:30,183
I should have been sick of the game

497
00:34:30,183 --> 00:34:32,124
by the end of two and two-thirds years.

498
00:34:32,124 --> 00:34:38,007
But I derived a great deal of satisfaction

499
00:34:38,007 --> 00:34:40,528
from just lobbing around a few.

500
00:34:41,184 --> 00:34:44,706
few minds, blowing up people, watching them cascade around.

501
00:34:44,706 --> 00:34:45,366
You know, the silly...

502
00:34:45,366 --> 00:34:52,330
There's an argument that we could have had more quality control, and we could have said,

503
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:58,113
yeah, you know what, let's not have the Moonraker outfits, they're a bit silly.

504
00:34:58,113 --> 00:35:00,615
But instead,

505
00:35:00,615 --> 00:35:04,477
Beeb made it, and it went in

506
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:10,720
this. It is silly, but it's also great. You know, the slapping.

507
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:10,980
How did...

508
00:35:11,515 --> 00:35:14,997
Nobody ever said on the team, no one ever said,

509
00:35:14,997 --> 00:35:16,257
this is ridiculous.

510
00:35:16,257 --> 00:35:21,700
It was one of a very, very long list of things.

511
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:24,982
You know, we wanted it, we implemented it,

512
00:35:24,982 --> 00:35:28,103
it seemed okay, we moved on.

513
00:35:28,103 --> 00:35:31,745
You know, it's absolutely hilarious and I love it,

514
00:35:31,745 --> 00:35:34,307
but again, you could make an argument

515
00:35:34,307 --> 00:35:37,428
that it should be different, more realistic,

516
00:35:37,428 --> 00:35:40,050
much more sober, and I think you'd,

517
00:35:40,298 --> 00:35:44,681
be taking a lot of character of the game. The toilets,

518
00:35:44,681 --> 00:35:47,843
the English and the Japanese found the

519
00:35:47,843 --> 00:35:49,344
humor in the toilets.

520
00:35:49,344 --> 00:35:50,025
So, overall,

521
00:35:50,025 --> 00:35:56,769
what I love to try and put into a game is a sense of humor.

522
00:35:56,769 --> 00:36:02,433
I think people want to have fun and a part of that is laughter,

523
00:36:02,433 --> 00:36:05,655
but also any game that presents a challenge, it can become

524
00:36:06,332 --> 00:36:09,014
become tiresome, the frustration can become overbearing.

525
00:36:09,014 --> 00:36:11,576
The more humor you can get in there, the better.

526
00:36:11,576 --> 00:36:13,798
And a lot of it is gonna be serendipity.

527
00:36:13,798 --> 00:36:18,221
It's gonna be things you do that you didn't plan on

528
00:36:18,221 --> 00:36:19,722
what they turn out to be a little bit silly.

529
00:36:19,722 --> 00:36:22,724
And if you can leave those,

530
00:36:22,724 --> 00:36:25,466
and it seems comfortable to leave them, that's great.

531
00:36:25,466 --> 00:36:30,530
Next thing I wanna talk about is mistakes I like.

532
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:34,633
Things that, by rights, are really, truly a mistake

533
00:36:34,633 --> 00:36:35,594
in game design.

534
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:45,944
I guess some of you might know, probably the biggest one,

535
00:36:45,944 --> 00:36:51,047
is Oddjob, really, I can hear someone sighing

536
00:36:51,047 --> 00:36:52,387
with anxiety and tension.

537
00:36:52,387 --> 00:36:56,489
You know, Oddjob was an annoying character in multiplayer

538
00:36:56,489 --> 00:37:00,011
because it was very hard to shoot because he was so short.

539
00:37:00,011 --> 00:37:03,813
And you could certainly make an argument

540
00:37:03,813 --> 00:37:06,475
he should never have been in the game.

541
00:37:06,475 --> 00:37:09,477
But it would be a better game without him.

542
00:37:09,822 --> 00:37:15,466
One of your friends is going to choose odd job, it's a cheaty thing to do, and it spoils the game.

543
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:19,028
But to me, that's a social dynamics problem.

544
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:24,472
You should be putting pressure on your friend to not be a cheater.

545
00:37:24,472 --> 00:37:29,855
People have redefined this as odd job is what the cheater picks.

546
00:37:29,855 --> 00:37:35,278
And I think that's a beautiful solution to what could be said was underbalancing.

547
00:37:38,515 --> 00:37:41,738
we didn't have time to balance all the characters.

548
00:37:41,738 --> 00:37:48,904
Really, we just threw them in for the multiplayer.

549
00:37:48,904 --> 00:37:52,867
But these little quirks and bits of sketchiness,

550
00:37:52,867 --> 00:37:56,510
I really strongly feel they bring personality to the game.

551
00:37:56,510 --> 00:38:00,954
Another one of the things that I personally feel

552
00:38:00,954 --> 00:38:04,196
so proud about the game is kind of sandbox nature.

553
00:38:04,196 --> 00:38:05,518
It's not really a,

554
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:08,318
It's not really a sandbox game, but,

555
00:38:08,318 --> 00:38:13,902
many of the levels are linear, and many of them,

556
00:38:13,902 --> 00:38:17,145
you have a little bit of choice.

557
00:38:17,145 --> 00:38:20,207
You could do the missions in this order or that order,

558
00:38:20,207 --> 00:38:23,850
but really, you can't really say it's a sandbox game,

559
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:27,732
but there's a sandboxy way to play it,

560
00:38:27,732 --> 00:38:30,995
and that's when you don't care about the missions anymore.

561
00:38:30,995 --> 00:38:33,397
When you've played it enough,

562
00:38:33,397 --> 00:38:35,458
and you just wanna mess around with the...

563
00:38:36,432 --> 00:38:47,357
with the guys. My personal fave, I spent, I remember well, six hours one evening playing

564
00:38:47,357 --> 00:38:55,281
and playing in the bunker, drawing in more of the infinite spawn enemies and shooting

565
00:38:55,281 --> 00:39:01,284
their hats off. Six hours. And I had like a massive collection of hats on the ground

566
00:39:01,284 --> 00:39:02,205
and you could shoot them.

567
00:39:02,545 --> 00:39:04,566
I don't know if you ever knew this,

568
00:39:04,566 --> 00:39:07,087
you can shoot them, you can get them up in the air,

569
00:39:07,087 --> 00:39:08,568
you can juggle the hats, you can shoot them up,

570
00:39:08,568 --> 00:39:09,629
a couple of people, you can shoot them,

571
00:39:09,629 --> 00:39:15,051
that is a really pleasurable thing

572
00:39:15,051 --> 00:39:18,793
and it's something that came out of the game development

573
00:39:18,793 --> 00:39:21,414
totally organically, nobody ever said,

574
00:39:21,414 --> 00:39:26,696
let's make it so that you can shoot the hats in the air

575
00:39:26,696 --> 00:39:28,097
for six hours.

576
00:39:28,097 --> 00:39:32,059
It would have been a ridiculous statement,

577
00:39:32,059 --> 00:39:32,259
but.

578
00:39:33,138 --> 00:39:37,840
What we did say was, hats are kind of funny,

579
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,940
why don't we have some hats?

580
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:47,343
And the rest was Mark Edmunds' execution.

581
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:49,444
Now, at one stage, we did have some

582
00:39:49,444 --> 00:39:51,765
much more violent effects in the game.

583
00:39:51,765 --> 00:39:56,306
We had one texture, a long animated texture,

584
00:39:56,306 --> 00:39:59,087
masses of blood, so when you shoot something,

585
00:39:59,376 --> 00:40:02,699
made me feel, you know, I consider myself to have a strong stomach,

586
00:40:02,699 --> 00:40:06,802
made me feel a little bit uncomfortable seeing this in glorious 3D.

587
00:40:06,802 --> 00:40:12,306
Howard Lincoln came round one time and he was,

588
00:40:12,306 --> 00:40:16,049
he saw one of our animations, which was to shoot someone in the groin,

589
00:40:16,049 --> 00:40:19,532
and they then would writhe around on the ground for,

590
00:40:19,532 --> 00:40:22,495
it seemed like it must have been less than two minutes,

591
00:40:22,495 --> 00:40:26,458
but it seemed like forever that they were there writhing around on the ground.

592
00:40:26,458 --> 00:40:28,740
And it had a humour value.

593
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:33,654
But really, it was too violent.

594
00:40:33,654 --> 00:40:38,757
And we took out the blip book texture, incredibly bloody.

595
00:40:38,757 --> 00:40:43,240
We toned down the hits so they're really quite subtle

596
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,562
on the bodies, they are red.

597
00:40:45,562 --> 00:40:50,585
The characters disappear after you have shot them.

598
00:40:50,585 --> 00:40:54,267
Totally not realistic, but it kind of underlines

599
00:40:54,267 --> 00:40:57,309
the fact that you shouldn't really care about them.

600
00:40:58,595 --> 00:41:01,376
that you shouldn't feel bad about shooting them.

601
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:05,117
It makes it easier to play a game which is,

602
00:41:05,117 --> 00:41:07,818
like any FPS, it is essentially about killing

603
00:41:07,818 --> 00:41:10,619
a long, long series of people.

604
00:41:10,619 --> 00:41:13,800
And I have to say, the graphics,

605
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,821
which today look so blocky and awkward,

606
00:41:16,821 --> 00:41:19,542
even in the day, they were a little,

607
00:41:19,542 --> 00:41:20,882
the shape of the head, it was a little bit,

608
00:41:20,882 --> 00:41:23,343
can't we do better than this?

609
00:41:23,343 --> 00:41:26,584
But that...

610
00:41:27,254 --> 00:41:31,156
Non-realism in the graphics was actually a big help

611
00:41:31,156 --> 00:41:34,799
to making it a more light game

612
00:41:34,799 --> 00:41:39,702
and more in touch with the Bond universe.

613
00:41:39,702 --> 00:41:46,627
So Grant Kirkhope was the other main composer

614
00:41:46,627 --> 00:41:47,847
on the project.

615
00:41:47,847 --> 00:41:53,451
He's also a guitarist and he did the guitar riffs

616
00:41:53,451 --> 00:41:56,693
on some of the more electric.

617
00:41:57,450 --> 00:42:02,592
rock versions of the Goldeneye, Monty Norman piece,

618
00:42:02,592 --> 00:42:03,612
Grant said to me,

619
00:42:03,612 --> 00:42:05,953
I wish I had added longer tunes to the game.

620
00:42:05,953 --> 00:42:08,674
I remember asking Mr. Hollis how long I should make the tunes

621
00:42:08,674 --> 00:42:10,735
as I was completely new to games and I had no idea.

622
00:42:10,735 --> 00:42:13,656
I remember him saying that he thought

623
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:14,816
a minute would be sufficient

624
00:42:14,816 --> 00:42:17,797
and quickly went back to his business and dismissed me.

625
00:42:17,797 --> 00:42:20,918
How was I to know that you could spend forever

626
00:42:20,918 --> 00:42:23,319
running around levels hearing the same tune

627
00:42:23,319 --> 00:42:25,280
over and over and over again?

628
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,200
Thanks, Martin.

629
00:42:26,988 --> 00:42:27,888
Sorry, sorry, Brian.

630
00:42:27,888 --> 00:42:28,809
Robin Beanland was the third composer.

631
00:42:28,809 --> 00:42:34,611
The music guys were the only people

632
00:42:34,611 --> 00:42:37,852
who were out of the team building.

633
00:42:37,852 --> 00:42:40,633
You know, the audio team was all together

634
00:42:40,633 --> 00:42:44,055
and Rare was privileged to have these three guys

635
00:42:44,055 --> 00:42:49,817
who were incredibly talented musicians, composers,

636
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:52,558
from the professional...

637
00:42:53,935 --> 00:43:00,456
world rather than games design, rather than game development per se.

638
00:43:00,456 --> 00:43:06,857
You know, Robin Wheeland only wrote one piece of music, which was the elevator music, which

639
00:43:06,857 --> 00:43:11,718
you can hear in such levels as the complex and the caves.

640
00:43:11,718 --> 00:43:14,359
It's just a little joke, but I'm very attached to it.

641
00:43:14,359 --> 00:43:19,800
Adrian Smith was the third and last artist.

642
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:20,700
He said to me,

643
00:43:21,745 --> 00:43:24,687
I was particularly pleased with the effects I produced for the game.

644
00:43:24,687 --> 00:43:27,088
The muzzle flashes, the trace of fire, and the explosions.

645
00:43:27,088 --> 00:43:28,748
We're very influenced with the film Heat.

646
00:43:28,748 --> 00:43:33,711
I was very pleased with the end sequence of the blood coming down the screen.

647
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:36,192
I wish I had copyrighted the watch graphics

648
00:43:36,192 --> 00:43:42,534
as a mechanic for the status for health indicator.

649
00:43:42,534 --> 00:43:46,896
I mentioned Stephen Ellis.

650
00:43:46,896 --> 00:43:51,678
So here's a nice shot of the multiplayer.

651
00:43:52,272 --> 00:43:54,094
this is actually running on an emulator.

652
00:43:54,094 --> 00:43:59,739
If you blow up the N64 screen on a big screen like this,

653
00:43:59,739 --> 00:44:04,343
you know, NTSC was the major limiting factor.

654
00:44:04,343 --> 00:44:08,086
It's really not, it's not got many pixels at all

655
00:44:08,086 --> 00:44:10,509
in the actual bandwidth for NTSC.

656
00:44:10,509 --> 00:44:14,812
But, you know, one of the things that I feel

657
00:44:14,812 --> 00:44:19,317
is held up least well about the game is the sharpness.

658
00:44:22,184 --> 00:44:26,545
I asked Adrian what he wished he'd put into the game,

659
00:44:26,545 --> 00:44:28,386
and he said the firing range.

660
00:44:28,386 --> 00:44:30,626
This was something he actually modeled.

661
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:32,567
It was an environment from Q Branch.

662
00:44:32,567 --> 00:44:33,967
It would've been great if it was added

663
00:44:33,967 --> 00:44:35,668
and incorporated with some minigames.

664
00:44:35,668 --> 00:44:38,849
Well, that was one of the very few things

665
00:44:38,849 --> 00:44:41,009
that we didn't get around to actually getting in,

666
00:44:41,009 --> 00:44:43,650
but it came true with Perfect Dark.

667
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:46,671
So, you know.

668
00:44:47,099 --> 00:44:51,122
By this point, we had the entire team assembled,

669
00:44:51,122 --> 00:44:52,222
and we're in the home stretch.

670
00:44:52,222 --> 00:44:57,806
I have to admit that I don't remember any talk

671
00:44:57,806 --> 00:45:01,668
of deadlines or schedules,

672
00:45:01,668 --> 00:45:05,050
which is completely astounding.

673
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:10,293
I assume that as a lead on the project,

674
00:45:10,293 --> 00:45:13,315
I was told what the deadline was,

675
00:45:13,315 --> 00:45:14,616
probably several times.

676
00:45:17,646 --> 00:45:23,889
But I was so focused on what could be done

677
00:45:23,889 --> 00:45:26,751
to make the game better that today,

678
00:45:26,751 --> 00:45:27,491
this isn't in my mind at all.

679
00:45:27,491 --> 00:45:30,672
Now this is actually a graph by Ben Cousins

680
00:45:30,672 --> 00:45:33,274
that he sent around on Twitter recently

681
00:45:33,274 --> 00:45:39,157
to try and educate people who don't know game development

682
00:45:39,157 --> 00:45:42,619
how quickly your game will actually develop.

683
00:45:42,619 --> 00:45:46,380
What you think will happen is you think linearly

684
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:47,421
your game will get better.

685
00:45:48,325 --> 00:45:52,206
Halfway through, you'll think you'll have half a game.

686
00:45:52,206 --> 00:45:52,846
It's not the case at all.

687
00:45:52,846 --> 00:45:54,847
Halfway through, you basically don't have anything.

688
00:45:54,847 --> 00:45:55,227
You don't have a game.

689
00:45:55,227 --> 00:45:59,628
So halfway through GoldenEye, we did have a game,

690
00:45:59,628 --> 00:46:02,729
and I remember sitting in the office with Mark Edmonds,

691
00:46:02,729 --> 00:46:04,610
and he said, you know, come on, have a go.

692
00:46:04,610 --> 00:46:09,071
And I had a go, and I just remember

693
00:46:09,071 --> 00:46:12,452
not really feeling anything, and I didn't say anything,

694
00:46:12,452 --> 00:46:13,793
and I just kind of, I guess my face.

695
00:46:16,535 --> 00:46:21,359
said everything. It was absolutely diabolical. It was in the bunker, in the interior.

696
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:25,983
The movement was completely dead. The sound effects were completely dead.

697
00:46:25,983 --> 00:46:31,067
The gun was dead on the screen. It had no reaction, no movement.

698
00:46:31,067 --> 00:46:33,949
There was no auto-aim. It was a crosshair.

699
00:46:33,949 --> 00:46:37,251
You had to line up perfectly. It was completely...

700
00:46:37,251 --> 00:46:40,414
No juice at all in the game.

701
00:46:40,414 --> 00:46:44,917
And, you know, essentially it took circa a year.

702
00:46:45,442 --> 00:46:49,506
to add layer on layer on layer of little movements,

703
00:46:49,506 --> 00:46:53,209
little sounds, little reactive effects,

704
00:46:53,209 --> 00:46:56,872
graphical effects on textures when you shoot,

705
00:46:56,872 --> 00:46:59,394
little glimpses on the gun.

706
00:46:59,394 --> 00:47:03,898
Layer upon layer upon layer of little effects

707
00:47:03,898 --> 00:47:07,141
just to try and make it feel more punchy

708
00:47:07,141 --> 00:47:09,623
and more like the game was actually listening

709
00:47:09,623 --> 00:47:11,325
to what you were doing.

710
00:47:14,171 --> 00:47:18,353
And in this final year, we were working so hard,

711
00:47:18,353 --> 00:47:22,074
I can't remember it at all.

712
00:47:22,074 --> 00:47:26,576
So I have almost nothing more to say about that.

713
00:47:26,576 --> 00:47:30,218
You know, the homestretch, the game was finished.

714
00:47:30,218 --> 00:47:36,360
We were able to add little sprinkles, little additions,

715
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:39,922
things that were just nice to have,

716
00:47:39,922 --> 00:47:40,922
like the cheats.

717
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:43,661
Steve Ellis programmed these,

718
00:47:43,661 --> 00:47:45,581
we just had a quick discussion in the office,

719
00:47:45,581 --> 00:47:47,122
oh yeah, that would be cool,

720
00:47:47,122 --> 00:47:51,583
why don't we have big heads like Donkey Kong Country,

721
00:47:51,583 --> 00:47:56,524
that'll be funny, Tiny Bonds, yeah, that's amusing.

722
00:47:56,524 --> 00:47:59,204
And we added, I think we had 17,

723
00:47:59,204 --> 00:48:02,505
it was just the number we could think of

724
00:48:02,505 --> 00:48:04,766
that we thought were cool.

725
00:48:04,766 --> 00:48:08,807
A little bit of an intro and an outro on the game.

726
00:48:08,807 --> 00:48:11,047
This is a joke.

727
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:18,596
referencing the BBFC, the film review board in the UK and this is my signature

728
00:48:18,596 --> 00:48:22,399
at the bottom left and my attempt to do to write James Bond, how he would sign it there.

729
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:27,463
Yeah, I mean all this was added right at the end. At this point we finally had a full complement of levels.

730
00:48:38,968 --> 00:48:43,390
18 from the GoldenEye movie and two extra bonus

731
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:45,631
from other films.

732
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:52,334
Here a little story about the balancing on that.

733
00:48:52,334 --> 00:49:01,599
Dave Doak and I played the Aztec after we had set it up.

734
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:07,522
And we both found it very hard on double O.

735
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:11,833
given a couple of hours, we could both do it.

736
00:49:11,833 --> 00:49:15,076
And then, being the mischievous pair that we were,

737
00:49:15,076 --> 00:49:19,419
I said to him, okay, that's good.

738
00:49:19,419 --> 00:49:24,043
Now, why don't you just make it a little bit harder?

739
00:49:24,043 --> 00:49:27,986
So, Aztec is just slightly harder

740
00:49:27,986 --> 00:49:33,250
than we were able to do ourselves at the time,

741
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:34,011
and it's, in my opinion,

742
00:49:34,011 --> 00:49:36,853
it's arguably the hardest level in the game on Double O.

743
00:49:37,378 --> 00:49:40,621
but I still get a great deal of satisfaction from playing it,

744
00:49:40,621 --> 00:49:42,182
although it can be frustrating at times.

745
00:49:42,182 --> 00:49:48,426
So Mark had a little story he pointed out to me that I'd forgotten about,

746
00:49:48,426 --> 00:49:50,688
which was the craziest, coolest thing.

747
00:49:50,688 --> 00:49:54,751
We'd finished the game, it had been through tests,

748
00:49:54,751 --> 00:49:57,913
we'd marked off all the bugs, everything was good.

749
00:49:57,913 --> 00:50:00,855
They send it through lot check, which is a long process

750
00:50:00,855 --> 00:50:04,157
where they play the game to death for like two weeks.

751
00:50:05,408 --> 00:50:07,970
and tested on all the combinations of televisions and so on.

752
00:50:07,970 --> 00:50:11,173
And then it came back and there was a problem.

753
00:50:11,173 --> 00:50:15,436
On one of the levels, when you played it in a certain order,

754
00:50:15,436 --> 00:50:18,779
it was probably the frigate, played in a certain order,

755
00:50:18,779 --> 00:50:21,421
there'd be certain sequence of characters being instantiated

756
00:50:21,421 --> 00:50:24,104
and they'd have terrible texture maps on them

757
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:25,405
because there wasn't enough memory.

758
00:50:25,405 --> 00:50:28,207
It had a dynamic memory system, which is,

759
00:50:28,207 --> 00:50:31,110
I mean, it worked okay most of the time,

760
00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:33,152
but memory was very tight on this level.

761
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:37,502
So what I had to do was write,

762
00:50:37,502 --> 00:50:40,904
in order to make a minimum change,

763
00:50:40,904 --> 00:50:47,247
and the version control system wasn't that reliable,

764
00:50:47,247 --> 00:50:50,489
in order to make a minimum change,

765
00:50:50,489 --> 00:50:52,130
that day I wrote a tool to extract the code

766
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:54,291
and the data for the code from the ROM.

767
00:50:54,291 --> 00:50:55,992
It was gzipped.

768
00:50:55,992 --> 00:50:59,734
So basically a custom un-gzipped.

769
00:51:00,577 --> 00:51:05,300
I wrote that, adjusted the memory numbers, re-GZipped it,

770
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:07,661
whopped it back into the ROM image

771
00:51:07,661 --> 00:51:09,883
without recompiling anything,

772
00:51:09,883 --> 00:51:12,324
and sent it to Nintendo.

773
00:51:12,324 --> 00:51:17,107
So that's the final version,

774
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:21,110
and Mark says, thankfully it worked,

775
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:23,372
and it still makes me smile.

776
00:51:23,372 --> 00:51:23,992
It's kind of,

777
00:51:23,992 --> 00:51:27,754
I don't know, I don't know if it was

778
00:51:27,754 --> 00:51:29,696
the best way to do that or not to this day.

779
00:51:30,643 --> 00:51:34,504
but it was a minimum change and it worked.

780
00:51:34,504 --> 00:51:41,286
Another little story from the final days,

781
00:51:41,286 --> 00:51:46,407
which was the Krates used to say vodka on them,

782
00:51:46,407 --> 00:51:49,248
which is Russian for vodka.

783
00:51:49,248 --> 00:51:51,349
Unfortunately, pretty late on,

784
00:51:51,349 --> 00:51:56,470
Nintendo noticed they had a guy who spoke Russian and said,

785
00:51:56,470 --> 00:51:57,790
oh yeah, hmm.

786
00:51:58,602 --> 00:52:03,084
But by and large, almost all the things we wanted to get into the game,

787
00:52:03,084 --> 00:52:05,625
we were able to fit them in,

788
00:52:05,625 --> 00:52:12,088
with no resistance from Red management or Nintendo

789
00:52:12,088 --> 00:52:15,169
or even E.ON and Dan Jack,

790
00:52:15,169 --> 00:52:18,910
who are the production company that make the movies

791
00:52:18,910 --> 00:52:22,252
and the license controlling company.

792
00:52:22,252 --> 00:52:25,393
So, you know, I'd like to say thank you to all of those people

793
00:52:25,393 --> 00:52:28,374
for allowing us to realise our vision.

794
00:52:30,229 --> 00:52:32,050
And then the game was finished.

795
00:52:32,050 --> 00:52:35,953
I guess it was a tiny bit of an anticlimax,

796
00:52:35,953 --> 00:52:38,475
but there was a certain amount of pleasure

797
00:52:38,475 --> 00:52:42,678
in being able to look at things that,

798
00:52:42,678 --> 00:52:47,662
nearly three years before, it'd just been a few words,

799
00:52:47,662 --> 00:52:50,624
saying the dam would have three towers,

800
00:52:50,624 --> 00:52:54,187
and now being able to enjoy our work.

801
00:52:54,187 --> 00:52:57,129
Mark Edmunds says,

802
00:52:57,129 --> 00:53:00,032
I remember Tim asking, shortly after we had finished,

803
00:53:00,338 --> 00:53:02,159
what I would rate the game.

804
00:53:02,159 --> 00:53:03,500
I think I said seven out of 10.

805
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:07,661
So there must have been a lot of areas I still thought

806
00:53:07,661 --> 00:53:11,302
could have been improved even back then.

807
00:53:11,302 --> 00:53:15,524
And I think that sums up how all of us felt about the game.

808
00:53:15,524 --> 00:53:20,585
We didn't really know whether it was awesome

809
00:53:20,585 --> 00:53:23,566
or whether it was okay or whether it would

810
00:53:23,566 --> 00:53:25,847
fall on deaf ears in the marketplace

811
00:53:25,847 --> 00:53:28,808
because the film had been a long time ago.

812
00:53:28,808 --> 00:53:29,748
And to our eyes,

813
00:53:30,292 --> 00:53:33,593
The graphics on the levels we'd made first

814
00:53:33,593 --> 00:53:36,334
were not as good as the graphics on the levels we'd made last.

815
00:53:36,334 --> 00:53:38,934
There's a lot of questions in our minds.

816
00:53:38,934 --> 00:53:42,256
This is the closest thing I've got to a GoldenEye team photo.

817
00:53:42,256 --> 00:53:46,777
This is not the GoldenEye team, this is part of the Perfect Dark team.

818
00:53:46,777 --> 00:53:48,698
From left to right, we've got Steve Ellis,

819
00:53:48,698 --> 00:53:50,618
Graham Norgate, Mark Edmonds,

820
00:53:50,618 --> 00:53:52,779
that's Ross Burry, who was Perfect Dark only,

821
00:53:52,779 --> 00:53:55,760
Carl Hilton, David Doak, myself,

822
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:56,080
Bee Jones,

823
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:59,682
and Lee Ray, who was also Perfect Dark only.

824
00:54:06,987 --> 00:54:10,409
So, auto or not-auto.

825
00:54:10,409 --> 00:54:15,992
Here, my opinion is that it's really quite toxic

826
00:54:15,992 --> 00:54:20,575
to go into making a game with the idea

827
00:54:20,575 --> 00:54:23,756
that one person is going to be giving all the orders

828
00:54:23,756 --> 00:54:26,078
and telling everybody what to do.

829
00:54:26,078 --> 00:54:28,019
I think that's absolutely the worst way

830
00:54:28,019 --> 00:54:30,300
to go about making a game.

831
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:32,521
And I tried, and I always try,

832
00:54:32,521 --> 00:54:34,983
but I tried on this project to...

833
00:54:36,374 --> 00:54:39,997
as much as possible have a flat management structure

834
00:54:39,997 --> 00:54:43,940
and have it so that people could implement their own features

835
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:45,421
if they felt like it,

836
00:54:45,421 --> 00:54:48,704
and people could simply contribute

837
00:54:48,704 --> 00:54:50,705
whatever it was that they wanted.

838
00:54:50,705 --> 00:54:54,588
You know, my chief concern in the early days

839
00:54:54,588 --> 00:54:58,411
was to simply direct the ship

840
00:54:58,411 --> 00:55:00,012
in what seemed like a good direction

841
00:55:00,012 --> 00:55:02,254
and make sure it had the best possible crew.

842
00:55:04,075 --> 00:55:15,460
And the thing is, when you work with incredibly intelligent people,

843
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:17,441
they reward your trust in them.

844
00:55:17,441 --> 00:55:21,502
And the most rewarding thing for them is their autonomy.

845
00:55:21,502 --> 00:55:23,503
And that means not telling them what to do.

846
00:55:23,503 --> 00:55:30,386
So really, my take home for this talk is,

847
00:55:30,386 --> 00:55:32,026
the less you can be...

848
00:55:32,884 --> 00:55:36,065
a boss, the less you can be telling everybody what to do,

849
00:55:36,065 --> 00:55:38,586
the better the likely results.

850
00:55:38,586 --> 00:55:44,507
Otor Notor, I think it's a false dichotomy, really.

851
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:50,589
I think the best games, you do have an element of personal,

852
00:55:50,589 --> 00:55:53,070
an element of personal authorship,

853
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:56,951
but you really need that very early in the project,

854
00:55:56,951 --> 00:55:59,991
before the team is really a team at all,

855
00:55:59,991 --> 00:56:00,332
because...

856
00:56:00,688 --> 00:56:04,590
If you're trying to steer a team around,

857
00:56:04,590 --> 00:56:09,012
and they're great people, they're gonna resist you,

858
00:56:09,012 --> 00:56:13,114
and it's gonna have an emotional cost on both sides.

859
00:56:13,114 --> 00:56:17,836
So really, I think the best thing is just a couple of drops

860
00:56:17,836 --> 00:56:20,998
of yourself in a project, and after that,

861
00:56:20,998 --> 00:56:25,100
everybody collaborating.

862
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:28,782
Adrian Smith said it best to me.

863
00:56:28,782 --> 00:56:29,362
He said.

864
00:56:30,567 --> 00:56:34,111
Everybody contributed to the game in their own way,

865
00:56:34,111 --> 00:56:35,953
which made it the success that it became.

866
00:56:35,953 --> 00:56:38,175
Nobody needs to be singled out.

867
00:56:38,175 --> 00:56:40,597
It was a team that made Goldeneye.

868
00:56:40,597 --> 00:56:45,742
Just like to say thank you for the Goldeneye team

869
00:56:45,742 --> 00:56:47,003
with their help with this talk.

870
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:09,044
I've also been asked to remind you to fill out your mobile evaluations.

871
00:57:09,044 --> 00:57:09,864
Thank you very much.

872
00:57:09,864 --> 00:57:12,386
I'm happy to take questions.

873
00:57:12,386 --> 00:57:13,787
Although, I talked for one hour.

874
00:57:13,787 --> 00:57:18,611
It's also lunchtime at the fourth floor, so.

875
00:57:18,611 --> 00:57:24,215
Questions is fine too, okay.

876
00:57:24,215 --> 00:57:32,502
A lot of people fight about first-person shooters on consoles versus PC.

877
00:57:33,207 --> 00:57:34,927
like mouse, keyboard, and all that stuff.

878
00:57:34,927 --> 00:57:36,948
How do you feel that even now,

879
00:57:36,948 --> 00:57:39,068
so many years after Goldeneye came out,

880
00:57:39,068 --> 00:57:40,388
when people talk about whether or not

881
00:57:40,388 --> 00:57:43,389
shooters can work on consoles,

882
00:57:43,389 --> 00:57:44,629
they still mention Goldeneye?

883
00:57:44,629 --> 00:57:48,530
Oh, they do, that's cool.

884
00:57:48,530 --> 00:57:53,751
How do I feel that people still mention Goldeneye

885
00:57:53,751 --> 00:57:56,951
when debating whether first-person shooters

886
00:57:56,951 --> 00:58:01,132
can work on console versus PC?

887
00:58:01,132 --> 00:58:01,532
I mean, to me,

888
00:58:02,839 --> 00:58:05,220
it seems a little bit sad.

889
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:08,943
Some of the acrimony between the two camps,

890
00:58:08,943 --> 00:58:12,805
the PC is the one true way camp,

891
00:58:12,805 --> 00:58:14,327
and the console camp,

892
00:58:14,327 --> 00:58:15,587
I think they're both...

893
00:58:15,587 --> 00:58:20,271
You can make awesome, awesome games on either.

894
00:58:20,271 --> 00:58:21,672
People will say,

895
00:58:21,672 --> 00:58:23,213
the little analogue stick is not so accurate.

896
00:58:23,213 --> 00:58:24,674
It's not as accurate as a mouse.

897
00:58:24,674 --> 00:58:27,896
But to me, it's like saying in golf,

898
00:58:27,896 --> 00:58:28,997
why don't you just pick up the ball

899
00:58:28,997 --> 00:58:31,318
and put it in the hole?

900
00:58:33,595 --> 00:58:38,718
I mean, every game comes with its own constraints,

901
00:58:38,718 --> 00:58:44,361
and playing the game, you live inside those constraints,

902
00:58:44,361 --> 00:58:45,181
and they make the game.

903
00:58:45,181 --> 00:58:49,784
So it's kind of a strange thing to say, to me.

904
00:58:49,784 --> 00:58:53,226
PC is designed for spreadsheet software.

905
00:58:53,226 --> 00:58:54,466
It's incredible, really,

906
00:58:54,466 --> 00:58:56,807
that you can make such an awesome game on it.

907
00:58:56,807 --> 00:58:59,989
On the other hand, consoles, they have the price pressure,

908
00:58:59,989 --> 00:59:02,270
but at least they're designed.

909
00:59:02,809 --> 00:59:03,830
dedicated for games.

910
00:59:03,830 --> 00:59:07,231
You know, I never felt any need for a divide

911
00:59:07,231 --> 00:59:08,712
between PCs and consoles.

912
00:59:08,712 --> 00:59:11,373
I never thought, oh, we can't make a great game

913
00:59:11,373 --> 00:59:14,295
because Doom or anything like that.

914
00:59:14,295 --> 00:59:17,856
I was always thinking, well, you know, let's go for this.

915
00:59:17,856 --> 00:59:23,419
I think it's awesome if people still mention Goldeneye.

916
00:59:23,419 --> 00:59:27,021
I mean, at the time, it was the best-selling FPS.

917
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:28,941
That's a great privilege and an honor.

918
00:59:30,236 --> 00:59:33,579
We've put a huge amount of work into making it as great as it could be,

919
00:59:33,579 --> 00:59:37,422
and it's lovely to be invited back to talks.

920
00:59:37,422 --> 00:59:41,666
It's pretty much 15 years, slightly over 15 years since it came out.

921
00:59:57,745 --> 01:00:00,887
well, let's call it a remake that came out recently.

922
01:00:00,887 --> 01:00:06,291
What do you think about the new iteration of Goldeneye?

923
01:00:06,291 --> 01:00:12,116
I played Eurocom Activision's remake a little bit.

924
01:00:12,116 --> 01:00:16,099
Honestly, not that much.

925
01:00:16,099 --> 01:00:26,207
I thought that it is really close to Call of Duty more in its gameplay.

926
01:00:27,350 --> 01:00:30,833
and the rhythm of the enemies,

927
01:00:30,833 --> 01:00:32,934
the rhythm with which they come to you,

928
01:00:32,934 --> 01:00:37,038
the way you approach them.

929
01:00:37,038 --> 01:00:39,340
You know, and in many other ways.

930
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:43,503
Although graphically I could see

931
01:00:43,503 --> 01:00:45,364
they put a huge amount of work

932
01:00:45,364 --> 01:00:49,088
into trying to be true to Goldeneye 007 on the N64.

933
01:00:49,088 --> 01:00:52,570
I think it's actually very difficult to analyze a game.

934
01:00:52,570 --> 01:00:54,792
It's actually very difficult to see what's in there.

935
01:00:54,792 --> 01:00:57,034
I think it's actually very difficult to replicate that.

936
01:00:57,955 --> 01:01:00,356
So, I enjoyed playing it.

937
01:01:00,356 --> 01:01:07,782
Maybe they were trying to cater to the marketplace today.

938
01:01:07,782 --> 01:01:10,944
More? I mean, if that was my job, I don't know

939
01:01:10,944 --> 01:01:14,907
that I would say, no, make it just like the original.

940
01:01:14,907 --> 01:01:19,150
It's very difficult because there aren't really games in the marketplace today

941
01:01:19,150 --> 01:01:21,132
that have that plate spinning thing where you...

942
01:01:21,498 --> 01:01:23,560
You have like three guards and you shoot one,

943
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:26,242
that keeps him busy, shoot the next, keeps him busy,

944
01:01:26,242 --> 01:01:27,603
shoot the next, keeps him busy,

945
01:01:27,603 --> 01:01:29,204
then you go back to the first one again.

946
01:01:29,204 --> 01:01:32,887
You know, there's lots of little mechanics like that

947
01:01:32,887 --> 01:01:36,050
in Goldeneye to do with the second to second

948
01:01:36,050 --> 01:01:39,072
and quarter second to quarter second interactions

949
01:01:39,072 --> 01:01:40,653
between you and the guards.

950
01:01:40,653 --> 01:01:45,237
You know, even stuff like the bunny hop they do.

951
01:01:45,237 --> 01:01:47,719
It's so silly, but it makes a big difference

952
01:01:47,719 --> 01:01:50,241
to the business of actually trying to shoot them.

953
01:01:51,739 --> 01:01:58,591
So you're hamstrung today by realism and by the games that are successful in the marketplace.

954
01:01:58,591 --> 01:02:00,795
So perhaps that's what they were thinking. I don't know.

955
01:02:15,617 --> 01:02:25,142
It sounded in your talk as if the first time you guys figured out that it was in any way successful was when they called you to ask to give this talk.

956
01:02:25,142 --> 01:02:35,608
So what was like, when did you guys start to feel that, hey, this game kind of matters in some way?

957
01:02:35,608 --> 01:02:42,352
Yeah, when did we, when did the team realize that, hey, this game kind of matters in a way?

958
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:47,541
You know, I remember going to E3 very near the end

959
01:02:47,541 --> 01:02:50,042
and feeling extremely pained

960
01:02:50,042 --> 01:02:53,143
at the things some people said when they came up.

961
01:02:53,143 --> 01:02:55,744
There were eight consoles with Goldeneye.

962
01:02:55,744 --> 01:02:57,245
People would come up and play.

963
01:02:57,245 --> 01:02:58,506
Some people said,

964
01:02:58,506 --> 01:03:01,907
oh wow, look at the graphics, they're amazing.

965
01:03:01,907 --> 01:03:02,868
And it's like, yes, score.

966
01:03:02,868 --> 01:03:04,088
And the next person to come,

967
01:03:04,088 --> 01:03:05,709
like what a piece of fucking shit.

968
01:03:05,709 --> 01:03:06,789
So, you know, not then.

969
01:03:17,672 --> 01:03:22,114
That was 95% of the way through developing the game.

970
01:03:22,114 --> 01:03:24,475
We had like five, six, seven levels in,

971
01:03:24,475 --> 01:03:26,296
working, we were basically nearly done.

972
01:03:26,296 --> 01:03:28,157
We shouldn't have gone to E3,

973
01:03:28,157 --> 01:03:30,478
we should have been back in,

974
01:03:30,478 --> 01:03:31,558
try across fixing bugs.

975
01:03:31,558 --> 01:03:36,521
And the game, I mean it didn't sell,

976
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:38,382
like many games do today,

977
01:03:38,382 --> 01:03:41,343
it didn't sell a massive spike.

978
01:03:41,343 --> 01:03:44,485
So it was really debatable if it was a success.

979
01:03:45,462 --> 01:03:49,564
once it was launched, and then it came out in Japan and much of Europe.

980
01:03:49,564 --> 01:03:55,605
David Oak has a graph of the rentals

981
01:03:55,605 --> 01:04:00,607
for Goldeneye in the US. It's very interesting.

982
01:04:00,607 --> 01:04:03,968
It's a completely flat

983
01:04:03,968 --> 01:04:04,968
graph. It just goes on

984
01:04:04,968 --> 01:04:06,429
for about two years.

985
01:04:06,429 --> 01:04:08,890
It just goes on and on and on.

986
01:04:08,890 --> 01:04:11,691
The game just sold,

987
01:04:11,691 --> 01:04:13,651
you know, not millions, it sold

988
01:04:13,651 --> 01:04:14,111
like 100,000, 200,000 a month.

989
01:04:15,058 --> 01:04:17,138
and then again, and then again, and again.

990
01:04:17,138 --> 01:04:23,080
And that was, I guess, when we realized it was something,

991
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:24,940
it was gonna sell more than a million copies.

992
01:04:24,940 --> 01:04:29,561
It was gonna sell more than two million.

993
01:04:29,561 --> 01:04:31,861
You know, gradually, we realized

994
01:04:31,861 --> 01:04:34,042
it was gonna have commercial success.

995
01:04:34,042 --> 01:04:40,743
But really, you know, I still don't know,

996
01:04:40,743 --> 01:04:41,603
and I wonder.

997
01:04:43,422 --> 01:04:46,323
But are people still going to mention it in another 15 years?

998
01:04:46,323 --> 01:04:49,524
Are they still going to mention it in another 50 years?

999
01:04:49,524 --> 01:04:53,285
So, you know, games can come and go,

1000
01:04:53,285 --> 01:04:54,885
they can be talked about for a while,

1001
01:04:54,885 --> 01:04:57,246
so, you know, really I still don't know

1002
01:04:57,246 --> 01:04:58,446
whether it will be eternal.

1003
01:04:58,446 --> 01:05:02,248
I think it's time you guys had a party.

1004
01:05:02,248 --> 01:05:04,729
Yeah, that's true.

1005
01:05:04,729 --> 01:05:06,629
Yeah.

1006
01:05:06,629 --> 01:05:11,951
Well, you know, the GoldenEye team is all spread around now.

1007
01:05:13,445 --> 01:05:18,127
A couple of guys in Canada and the US.

1008
01:05:18,127 --> 01:05:19,248
And spread around the UK.

1009
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:37,114
But still, yeah, that's a good idea.

1010
01:05:37,114 --> 01:05:40,676
Hey, Gold and I seem to be this kind of perfect storm

1011
01:05:40,676 --> 01:05:42,917
of like eight guys is just.

1012
01:05:43,432 --> 01:05:44,953
Never made a game before.

1013
01:05:44,953 --> 01:05:47,213
Your management seems to be just,

1014
01:05:47,213 --> 01:05:48,414
yeah, go ahead, do what you like.

1015
01:05:48,414 --> 01:05:51,935
This kind of really free, happy time

1016
01:05:51,935 --> 01:05:54,475
of just game development that has become

1017
01:05:54,475 --> 01:05:55,996
the quintessential Bond game.

1018
01:05:55,996 --> 01:05:58,317
Every game since has tried to recapture

1019
01:05:58,317 --> 01:05:59,837
that spirit and that excitement.

1020
01:05:59,837 --> 01:06:02,178
Do you think that's ever doable again

1021
01:06:02,178 --> 01:06:04,819
now that the game industry has gotten so serious?

1022
01:06:04,819 --> 01:06:07,859
Do you think that's a, it was a one-time thing

1023
01:06:07,859 --> 01:06:12,641
of everything coming together and making this great game?

1024
01:06:12,641 --> 01:06:12,681
So.

1025
01:06:15,437 --> 01:06:25,543
Goldeneye was a perfect storm of everything coming together, you say, and it's the quintessential

1026
01:06:25,543 --> 01:06:33,108
Bond game that people try and live up to. Is there any possibility that that could reoccur?

1027
01:06:33,108 --> 01:06:41,433
First of all, I have no subject... I have no objectivity. I'm completely in love with

1028
01:06:41,433 --> 01:06:45,236
my games. Every one of them.

1029
01:06:45,687 --> 01:06:50,770
And I don't feel I should be raised up on a podium

1030
01:06:50,770 --> 01:06:53,632
in a position of authority to decide that.

1031
01:06:53,632 --> 01:06:57,574
I know that I personally love Goldeneye

1032
01:06:57,574 --> 01:07:01,716
in the way it turned out,

1033
01:07:01,716 --> 01:07:08,000
but whether it will always be the best Bond game,

1034
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,261
I really cannot say.

1035
01:07:09,261 --> 01:07:12,623
You mentioned one thing I'd like to pick up,

1036
01:07:12,623 --> 01:07:14,784
which was that I gave the impression that

1037
01:07:15,111 --> 01:07:19,453
You know, it was all plain sailing and management was like,

1038
01:07:19,453 --> 01:07:21,894
yeah, do whatever you want.

1039
01:07:21,894 --> 01:07:26,396
I do have some stories of things they wanted to happen

1040
01:07:26,396 --> 01:07:28,237
that, you know, mainly didn't,

1041
01:07:28,237 --> 01:07:29,297
but occasionally did happen,

1042
01:07:29,297 --> 01:07:32,379
which I'd be happy to tell if anybody wants to hear them.

1043
01:07:32,379 --> 01:07:35,640
But 99% of the time, yes, it was,

1044
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:36,921
we got to do what we wanted.

1045
01:07:52,216 --> 01:07:55,014
That seems to be it for questions. Thank you ever so much everyone.
