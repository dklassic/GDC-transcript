1
00:00:05,958 --> 00:00:09,501
My name is David Whaley, and I made a game called The First

2
00:00:09,581 --> 00:00:09,821
Tree.

3
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:12,163
And as you can see from the title,

4
00:00:12,624 --> 00:00:14,666
it was no time, no budget, no problem.

5
00:00:15,346 --> 00:00:17,128
But it's kind of a, I don't know why I wrote that,

6
00:00:17,168 --> 00:00:19,670
because there was a lot of problems in finishing my game.

7
00:00:20,011 --> 00:00:21,252
There was a lot of sacrifices.

8
00:00:21,872 --> 00:00:22,673
But it worked out.

9
00:00:23,354 --> 00:00:24,134
It was successful.

10
00:00:24,575 --> 00:00:26,737
And that's what I'm going to talk about with you guys today.

11
00:00:28,478 --> 00:00:30,760
So if you don't know what it is, The First Tree,

12
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,922
I should be playing.

13
00:00:35,047 --> 00:00:38,070
So The First Tree is a third-person exploration game

14
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:40,472
about a fox looking for her missing cubs,

15
00:00:41,212 --> 00:00:44,595
and also about a second parallel story being told

16
00:00:44,755 --> 00:00:47,837
about a son reconnecting with his father in Alaska.

17
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:51,660
And this was a project I made to get out

18
00:00:51,781 --> 00:00:54,843
these emotions of me losing my own father

19
00:00:54,883 --> 00:00:57,625
to a heart attack early in life, or in 2010.

20
00:00:58,026 --> 00:01:00,988
And so I made this, and I wanted to share

21
00:01:01,028 --> 00:01:01,889
that story with people.

22
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,202
And for a hobbyist project, it did a little better

23
00:01:05,242 --> 00:01:05,782
than I thought.

24
00:01:05,822 --> 00:01:08,344
I was able to show it at the Smithsonian American Art Museum,

25
00:01:08,644 --> 00:01:09,685
showed it at PAX West.

26
00:01:10,645 --> 00:01:15,128
And it was cool to let that little story

27
00:01:15,148 --> 00:01:16,609
and gain traction with people.

28
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:19,551
And maybe you're thinking, that's not a super unique story

29
00:01:20,031 --> 00:01:22,113
for an indie game, an indie game success story.

30
00:01:22,653 --> 00:01:24,234
But what usually gets people's attention

31
00:01:24,794 --> 00:01:26,035
is that I finished the game.

32
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,933
while working full-time as a technical artist

33
00:01:29,033 --> 00:01:30,734
at a VR company called The Void.

34
00:01:30,754 --> 00:01:35,678
I was raising two kids and making sure that my partner,

35
00:01:35,798 --> 00:01:37,880
Elise, had time for her art career.

36
00:01:38,761 --> 00:01:41,183
And then I made the game without very much money at all.

37
00:01:42,404 --> 00:01:45,426
So when the game launched on Steam, September 14, 2017,

38
00:01:47,168 --> 00:01:49,129
it cost me $10,000 to make.

39
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:53,113
And that includes my website, conventions, music, everything.

40
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:58,088
The time was about 18 months of nights and weekends, or about a thousand hours.

41
00:01:58,628 --> 00:01:59,388
And its first year it made $150,000.

42
00:01:59,968 --> 00:02:02,889
That was my gross revenue.

43
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:08,190
And consoles came a year later, I was able to use those funds to pay for a console port

44
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:09,770
with the assistance of Doogames.

45
00:02:10,491 --> 00:02:13,991
And that made $150,000 in its first month on all three consoles.

46
00:02:14,692 --> 00:02:15,412
So yeah, it was awesome.

47
00:02:15,432 --> 00:02:16,492
It was like a dream come true.

48
00:02:16,792 --> 00:02:19,253
And a lot of people ask me, how did you do that with so little time and money?

49
00:02:20,671 --> 00:02:23,232
What you've probably heard about is how the game

50
00:02:23,452 --> 00:02:24,892
had a lot of Reddit traction.

51
00:02:25,892 --> 00:02:29,213
And I got good at submitting this content, these GIFs,

52
00:02:30,113 --> 00:02:31,714
and seeing how they would perform.

53
00:02:31,754 --> 00:02:32,774
And so when on launch day,

54
00:02:32,794 --> 00:02:35,295
I could have the marketing dream come true

55
00:02:35,595 --> 00:02:37,315
and then get on the front page of Reddit,

56
00:02:37,355 --> 00:02:39,916
which got me about three million views on that GIF

57
00:02:40,316 --> 00:02:42,097
and 200,000 Steam page visits.

58
00:02:43,417 --> 00:02:46,678
And so, and then on consoles in November 2018,

59
00:02:46,738 --> 00:02:48,298
when the console release came out,

60
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:49,098
I was able to do it again.

61
00:02:50,168 --> 00:02:51,929
And so, why did it do so well?

62
00:02:51,949 --> 00:02:53,470
That's a question I ask myself a lot.

63
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,811
And I would say luck did have a big part to it,

64
00:02:56,871 --> 00:02:58,372
but it's not the entire answer.

65
00:02:59,433 --> 00:03:03,934
The facts are that I submitted a lot of gifts everywhere.

66
00:03:03,955 --> 00:03:06,736
And it was consistent posting over 18 months.

67
00:03:07,516 --> 00:03:09,637
Some of the posts did great, some of them didn't.

68
00:03:10,798 --> 00:03:13,359
And it basically comes down to how do you eat an elephant?

69
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:15,259
Or a fox, in this case.

70
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,840
You eat it one bite at a time.

71
00:03:17,661 --> 00:03:18,981
So those years of experimenting,

72
00:03:19,021 --> 00:03:19,861
that taught me what works.

73
00:03:21,418 --> 00:03:24,060
What also taught me a lot is that I made another game

74
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,282
before the first tree, just to challenge myself,

75
00:03:26,302 --> 00:03:28,484
because I come from a film and design background.

76
00:03:28,504 --> 00:03:30,746
I'm not much of a coder at all.

77
00:03:31,206 --> 00:03:32,487
So I made my first game.

78
00:03:32,807 --> 00:03:34,149
It was a first-person exploration game

79
00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:35,169
called Home is Where One Starts.

80
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:39,313
And I used mostly just Unity assets and PlayMaker.

81
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:42,095
And through a lot of bundles and extreme discount,

82
00:03:42,115 --> 00:03:42,556
I was able to make $15,000.

83
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,381
And it also taught me what not to do

84
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:48,623
when releasing your first indie game.

85
00:03:49,564 --> 00:03:51,246
I launched at midnight because I was like,

86
00:03:51,266 --> 00:03:52,246
oh, that's what movies do.

87
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:53,387
They do a midnight premiere.

88
00:03:53,648 --> 00:03:54,168
I'll try that.

89
00:03:54,749 --> 00:03:57,391
I changed my launch date last minute for some reason.

90
00:03:57,531 --> 00:03:59,232
I had no one covered the game on day one.

91
00:03:59,393 --> 00:04:01,655
I had no email list, only 200 Twitter followers.

92
00:04:02,295 --> 00:04:05,098
And there was a lot of popularly requested features

93
00:04:05,138 --> 00:04:07,400
for Steam, like trading cards and subtitles

94
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,501
that I waited to patch in later.

95
00:04:10,797 --> 00:04:13,283
So I've distilled what I learned from that first experience

96
00:04:13,965 --> 00:04:16,672
into my launch plan for the first tree.

97
00:04:17,807 --> 00:04:20,588
And how would I sum up my launch plan for the first tree?

98
00:04:21,288 --> 00:04:24,369
The best thing is, I would say, is it's low time,

99
00:04:24,529 --> 00:04:25,890
high impact strategies.

100
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,731
I'm not sure that won't be taught in business schools

101
00:04:28,751 --> 00:04:29,371
anytime soon.

102
00:04:29,872 --> 00:04:32,713
But what it just means to me is you don't have a lot of time,

103
00:04:33,413 --> 00:04:34,914
you need to be as productive as possible,

104
00:04:35,694 --> 00:04:38,815
and try to take that risk of making a high impact,

105
00:04:39,496 --> 00:04:41,556
even if it's a little more risky.

106
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,606
So the rest of my talk's divided into two sections,

107
00:04:45,227 --> 00:04:47,151
how I developed the game with little time and money

108
00:04:47,191 --> 00:04:48,113
and how I marketed it.

109
00:04:49,176 --> 00:04:51,741
So first, just finding that time to finish your game.

110
00:04:53,052 --> 00:04:55,653
That's hard, especially if you're a parent,

111
00:04:55,733 --> 00:04:57,973
you know how exhausting life can be.

112
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:00,994
So this was kind of our rough plan with me

113
00:05:01,254 --> 00:05:02,114
and my wife, Elise.

114
00:05:02,634 --> 00:05:05,395
I'd work full time, and then also,

115
00:05:05,415 --> 00:05:06,975
Elise needed time for her art career.

116
00:05:07,695 --> 00:05:11,576
So we hired neighborhood teens to see

117
00:05:11,596 --> 00:05:13,937
if they could watch our kids for about $7 an hour.

118
00:05:14,477 --> 00:05:15,917
So I had to get home from work, work 45 minutes.

119
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,258
and then get the quality time together.

120
00:05:19,578 --> 00:05:21,139
And then at the end of the night,

121
00:05:21,379 --> 00:05:23,461
probably fit in two hours of development.

122
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,642
And that gave me about 10 hours a week.

123
00:05:27,763 --> 00:05:29,664
And usually, you know, there were sacrifices there.

124
00:05:29,764 --> 00:05:32,285
Like I couldn't, I wish I've played more

125
00:05:32,325 --> 00:05:34,647
of all of your guys' indie games, but I definitely haven't.

126
00:05:34,987 --> 00:05:36,688
I didn't play many games or watch many movies.

127
00:05:37,328 --> 00:05:39,789
Usually like to get quality time with Elise,

128
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:41,931
we'd watch like a people getting hurt

129
00:05:41,971 --> 00:05:44,772
on YouTube compilation video at the end of the night.

130
00:05:46,225 --> 00:05:48,066
And at The Void, I don't think you need

131
00:05:48,086 --> 00:05:50,707
a game development day job to make

132
00:05:50,807 --> 00:05:52,147
your passion project come to life.

133
00:05:52,827 --> 00:05:56,008
I will say though, there is some crossover benefit.

134
00:05:56,629 --> 00:05:59,229
I remember, again, I'm not much of a programmer,

135
00:05:59,269 --> 00:06:00,990
but I was learning about singletons the first time,

136
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,871
and I was reusing that in a project at The Void.

137
00:06:03,891 --> 00:06:06,071
And just learning about that helped me fix

138
00:06:06,131 --> 00:06:07,632
a Steamworks initialization bug

139
00:06:07,652 --> 00:06:08,752
that had caused me a ton of grief.

140
00:06:09,413 --> 00:06:11,753
So that's cool when that stuff crosses over,

141
00:06:11,793 --> 00:06:14,054
but I don't know if it's necessarily required.

142
00:06:15,138 --> 00:06:16,199
Okay, so you found the time.

143
00:06:16,739 --> 00:06:18,460
Now, what do you do with that?

144
00:06:19,341 --> 00:06:20,661
Now this is something, I would even say

145
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:22,522
like I used to be a little embarrassed about this,

146
00:06:23,343 --> 00:06:25,764
but I'm now a huge believer in using

147
00:06:25,864 --> 00:06:28,185
publicly available assets that you can license.

148
00:06:29,026 --> 00:06:30,246
And prototyping, it's great,

149
00:06:31,007 --> 00:06:32,708
but just using it as a springboard

150
00:06:33,168 --> 00:06:34,629
to save yourself valuable time

151
00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:36,610
and like creating it, like revising it

152
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:38,531
and changing it to add your own creative twist,

153
00:06:39,091 --> 00:06:40,692
that's the reason my game was finished.

154
00:06:41,232 --> 00:06:42,533
That's why my game released,

155
00:06:42,753 --> 00:06:43,674
is because of these resources.

156
00:06:45,525 --> 00:06:48,271
I probably could have made a lot of this stuff myself,

157
00:06:48,511 --> 00:06:50,555
but I estimated it saved me roughly 600 hours.

158
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,501
And while I did have to spend a little bit of money,

159
00:06:54,661 --> 00:06:57,803
it was nothing compared to like hiring a full-time composer

160
00:06:57,823 --> 00:06:59,344
or even voice actors.

161
00:06:59,504 --> 00:07:00,445
I did the voice acting.

162
00:07:00,465 --> 00:07:02,526
I pressured my wife to do the voice acting.

163
00:07:02,566 --> 00:07:03,127
She did great.

164
00:07:03,427 --> 00:07:04,508
I wish I didn't do that.

165
00:07:05,108 --> 00:07:06,289
So maybe we should have hired an actor,

166
00:07:06,429 --> 00:07:07,650
but you just gotta do what's best for you.

167
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:12,213
This is like an example of how I tried to make these,

168
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,835
you know, this beautiful environment pack

169
00:07:14,895 --> 00:07:16,356
by Michael Gustafson.

170
00:07:16,596 --> 00:07:17,456
Tried to make it my own.

171
00:07:18,788 --> 00:07:23,490
And so, yeah, I would even say it helped other artists too

172
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,711
when the game was successful in the marketing.

173
00:07:26,252 --> 00:07:28,393
All the music was done by a composer named Josh Kramer,

174
00:07:28,413 --> 00:07:31,154
and his music is gorgeous,

175
00:07:31,334 --> 00:07:33,175
and it was only $30 to $50 a song.

176
00:07:34,196 --> 00:07:35,897
And so when the game did well,

177
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,718
we were able to kind of form a partnership

178
00:07:39,238 --> 00:07:40,519
and help get his music out there more.

179
00:07:42,287 --> 00:07:44,848
So this is the third thing about finishing your game,

180
00:07:45,488 --> 00:07:48,549
is I tried to challenge myself never to have a 0% day.

181
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:53,391
I have this GIF running because I love UX and UI design.

182
00:07:54,211 --> 00:07:55,732
And I remember I was so burnt out,

183
00:07:55,772 --> 00:07:57,392
I did not want to work on the game anymore,

184
00:07:57,432 --> 00:07:58,453
but I love doing this stuff.

185
00:07:59,193 --> 00:08:01,194
So my thought was if you can work,

186
00:08:01,274 --> 00:08:04,575
just aim for a 1% day and get those small wins,

187
00:08:05,355 --> 00:08:08,816
then it will encourage you to do the harder stuff

188
00:08:08,856 --> 00:08:09,536
that you hate to do.

189
00:08:10,297 --> 00:08:11,638
So whether it was just answering an email

190
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:12,819
or doing a small color change,

191
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,820
I tried to work on my game every single day.

192
00:08:16,361 --> 00:08:18,723
So what are the cons of doing these low-time,

193
00:08:18,743 --> 00:08:20,185
high-impact strategies for development?

194
00:08:20,865 --> 00:08:23,447
Well, I did have to compromise my vision a little bit.

195
00:08:23,547 --> 00:08:26,530
Like, I'm inspired by the games like Firewatch and Journey.

196
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:28,535
But of course it couldn't be like that.

197
00:08:28,555 --> 00:08:30,995
It was just me using licensed assets.

198
00:08:31,736 --> 00:08:34,697
So I tried to, you know, my game had to reflect that.

199
00:08:34,837 --> 00:08:35,697
It was a shorter game.

200
00:08:35,717 --> 00:08:37,458
It was like one and a half hours to two hours long

201
00:08:37,498 --> 00:08:40,579
and I launched it for $8 on Steam when it came out.

202
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,040
Another problem is recognizable stock assets,

203
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,102
which I am surprised that it wasn't as a big of a deal

204
00:08:49,122 --> 00:08:49,762
as I would have thought.

205
00:08:49,882 --> 00:08:52,183
I probably skimmed about 10,000 comments about my game

206
00:08:52,763 --> 00:08:54,604
and only about 10 to 15 even mentioned

207
00:08:54,844 --> 00:08:56,905
that they recognize the art assets or the music.

208
00:08:58,485 --> 00:09:00,969
So, and even usually commenters would say,

209
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:02,711
get mad at those people making fun of it,

210
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,253
saying, it's not an asset flip, dude,

211
00:09:04,273 --> 00:09:05,174
he's trying to make it his own.

212
00:09:05,655 --> 00:09:06,316
So that's pretty cool.

213
00:09:07,037 --> 00:09:08,098
I will say, though, with music,

214
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:10,482
especially with YouTube copyright IDs,

215
00:09:10,682 --> 00:09:13,105
if you're using stock music, those will get flagged,

216
00:09:13,526 --> 00:09:15,789
and that could make content creators a little upset.

217
00:09:16,801 --> 00:09:18,843
So if your game is dependent on that,

218
00:09:19,624 --> 00:09:21,806
sharing those videos online, that's

219
00:09:21,886 --> 00:09:22,807
something to keep in mind.

220
00:09:23,628 --> 00:09:25,009
And then a really big problem was the

221
00:09:25,049 --> 00:09:26,590
extremely messy project.

222
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:29,373
It was like a dumpster fire of a Unity project.

223
00:09:29,974 --> 00:09:31,695
And that caused a lot of problems with the console

224
00:09:31,735 --> 00:09:34,158
porting, but luckily, Do Games, they were awesome.

225
00:09:34,418 --> 00:09:36,380
And they helped a lot with fixing it, working with my

226
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,521
work style.

227
00:09:38,282 --> 00:09:40,043
So that's something to keep in mind as well.

228
00:09:41,765 --> 00:09:42,846
That was one of the original pack.

229
00:09:43,826 --> 00:09:45,607
So what's the one pro for all those cons?

230
00:09:45,827 --> 00:09:47,507
Well, the one pro is you finished your game.

231
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:49,348
And that's the most important thing ever.

232
00:09:49,368 --> 00:09:50,808
And it doesn't mean it's perfect.

233
00:09:51,169 --> 00:09:52,169
Just means it's presentable.

234
00:09:53,489 --> 00:09:56,330
So in this day and age, you all know that marketing, you

235
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:57,431
have to do that concurrently.

236
00:09:58,091 --> 00:10:00,492
And so that's what I tried to do with a typical week.

237
00:10:00,732 --> 00:10:03,413
I would do about three hours of making a GIF.

238
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:08,573
and posting that GIF and then doing that for like 12 to 18 months.

239
00:10:09,453 --> 00:10:13,735
And what I usually do every week was I'd share it on Twitter, usually using the game, the

240
00:10:13,795 --> 00:10:17,437
hashtags screenshot Saturday and then made with Unity on Friday.

241
00:10:17,677 --> 00:10:21,779
Unity retweeted me several times and that's probably how I got like a third of my followers.

242
00:10:22,945 --> 00:10:26,247
I posted on Tumblr with hashtags, the Reddit game dev,

243
00:10:26,307 --> 00:10:28,628
there's screenshot Saturday, threads in that.

244
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:31,349
And yeah, at the beginning,

245
00:10:31,569 --> 00:10:33,050
did have a lot more marketing work,

246
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,450
it was top heavy in that regard.

247
00:10:35,171 --> 00:10:37,332
But that's why I would encourage you guys

248
00:10:37,372 --> 00:10:38,912
to make your trailer as soon as possible,

249
00:10:38,952 --> 00:10:40,493
create your website as soon as possible,

250
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:43,214
and create your Steam page with tags.

251
00:10:43,594 --> 00:10:45,295
And so you can just get those organic wishlists.

252
00:10:45,715 --> 00:10:46,436
So that's what I tried to do,

253
00:10:46,476 --> 00:10:47,396
it just took a long time,

254
00:10:47,456 --> 00:10:49,557
it was a drop by drop accumulation.

255
00:10:51,072 --> 00:10:54,374
Now with the marketing, I wanted to first focus on

256
00:10:54,514 --> 00:10:56,275
finding your hook before development,

257
00:10:56,335 --> 00:10:58,996
which people ask me, what was like the magic ingredient

258
00:10:59,036 --> 00:11:01,457
that your game was able to resonate with people so much?

259
00:11:02,198 --> 00:11:03,819
And this one, it kind of happened by accident.

260
00:11:04,659 --> 00:11:06,660
The cynical side is it's like,

261
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,842
if you took two popular things, people would love it.

262
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:11,643
But if you take a brand new original thing,

263
00:11:11,663 --> 00:11:13,604
then people like, they don't know how to react.

264
00:11:14,224 --> 00:11:15,865
And so with the first tree, you know,

265
00:11:15,985 --> 00:11:16,945
I took my love of journey.

266
00:11:17,585 --> 00:11:20,187
and I also, there was a people, there were people out there

267
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:22,968
who were like fans of anything that had a fox in it.

268
00:11:23,828 --> 00:11:25,409
And you know, I picked a fox because it was,

269
00:11:25,589 --> 00:11:26,870
you know, there was a personal connection.

270
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:28,770
It was like a wife, my wife's family name.

271
00:11:29,591 --> 00:11:31,892
But people like, they marketed it for me

272
00:11:31,972 --> 00:11:33,452
because they loved the idea so much.

273
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:35,653
And so I don't think, you know,

274
00:11:35,673 --> 00:11:37,874
I think the optimistic side of that is,

275
00:11:38,214 --> 00:11:40,395
I think it's good to remind gamers of things that they love.

276
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:42,756
I don't think it's a bad thing.

277
00:11:44,174 --> 00:11:46,717
The other thing is because I come from an artist background,

278
00:11:47,238 --> 00:11:49,701
Visual's first development took priority,

279
00:11:50,241 --> 00:11:52,184
and that was something that the makers of Ooblets said

280
00:11:52,224 --> 00:11:55,407
as well, they tried to make GIFs as soon as possible

281
00:11:55,427 --> 00:11:56,088
so they can market it.

282
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:58,871
And that's why I would encourage you guys

283
00:11:58,911 --> 00:12:01,074
to get the website and trailer and Steam page.

284
00:12:02,932 --> 00:12:04,934
I wouldn't even waste time on screenshots.

285
00:12:05,254 --> 00:12:07,396
When I would share screenshots online,

286
00:12:07,716 --> 00:12:09,237
GIFs were shared 10 times more.

287
00:12:09,257 --> 00:12:15,182
And the best part of all this is doing this first

288
00:12:15,362 --> 00:12:16,263
is it gives you data.

289
00:12:16,763 --> 00:12:19,045
Like what game ideas, what scenes from your game

290
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:20,326
resonate best with people?

291
00:12:20,847 --> 00:12:23,108
And that's the data you can use when you make your trailer.

292
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:26,613
and then you can make a really killer trailer

293
00:12:26,633 --> 00:12:28,035
because you have the data of like,

294
00:12:28,235 --> 00:12:29,997
oh, that post has so many likes,

295
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:31,319
people really like that shot.

296
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,924
So anyway, what is like the point of all this?

297
00:12:35,965 --> 00:12:37,687
What's the call to action for all that marketing?

298
00:12:38,609 --> 00:12:38,849
Well.

299
00:12:39,605 --> 00:12:42,527
My plan was, with the email list and the wish list,

300
00:12:42,927 --> 00:12:44,829
and something I called the social media blitz,

301
00:12:44,949 --> 00:12:45,950
which happens on launch day,

302
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,911
I would get on the new and trending tab.

303
00:12:48,131 --> 00:12:49,633
That was the goal of all this,

304
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:51,134
was to gather those wish lists.

305
00:12:52,195 --> 00:12:54,737
And it's because of, in this day and age,

306
00:12:54,777 --> 00:12:57,639
how important Steam is with day one purchases,

307
00:12:57,999 --> 00:12:59,801
and even first hour purchases,

308
00:12:59,921 --> 00:13:02,122
because that's how you please the algorithm gods,

309
00:13:02,523 --> 00:13:04,004
and that's how you get on the front page of Steam.

310
00:13:04,544 --> 00:13:05,985
And you wanna get on the front page of Steam,

311
00:13:06,706 --> 00:13:09,027
because the amount of traffic is insane.

312
00:13:09,787 --> 00:13:11,387
Even with a viral Reddit post,

313
00:13:11,727 --> 00:13:13,728
which had hundreds of thousands of views,

314
00:13:13,748 --> 00:13:16,408
the Steam traffic on the first day,

315
00:13:16,448 --> 00:13:17,829
I think that's the first two days,

316
00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:21,429
it was 88% of everything.

317
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:24,650
And so the new and trending tab, you need to get on it.

318
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,831
And that was my goal with that,

319
00:13:27,951 --> 00:13:29,271
and that's why I went to Reddit,

320
00:13:29,311 --> 00:13:31,112
was to get a huge influx of traffic

321
00:13:31,652 --> 00:13:33,392
to catch the algorithm's attention.

322
00:13:34,743 --> 00:13:35,783
And so that's kind of what happened,

323
00:13:35,863 --> 00:13:38,684
and that's what's happened with a lot of other indie games.

324
00:13:38,824 --> 00:13:41,124
There's a lot of great GIFs that have been shared

325
00:13:41,144 --> 00:13:43,344
on the gaming subreddit, which has 20 million subscribers.

326
00:13:44,384 --> 00:13:47,005
And if you know where to look, you can find good examples.

327
00:13:47,405 --> 00:13:48,445
I know a data scientist,

328
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:50,706
he analyzed a lot of the top Reddit posts.

329
00:13:51,346 --> 00:13:53,606
And he said, he mentioned that there's usually time

330
00:13:53,926 --> 00:13:56,487
involved, like, I've been working on my game for three years

331
00:13:56,987 --> 00:13:58,927
or there's emotion in the title.

332
00:13:59,627 --> 00:14:02,268
Like even in this, what the golf GIF that says like,

333
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:03,528
for people who hate golf.

334
00:14:04,268 --> 00:14:05,308
catches people's attention.

335
00:14:05,449 --> 00:14:07,029
I think it's important not to be a sales guy,

336
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:08,410
but just be like a friend,

337
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,411
showing off something that you're really proud of.

338
00:14:12,933 --> 00:14:14,734
Part of this, I guess, part of what I learned

339
00:14:14,774 --> 00:14:15,935
is that it's not just Reddit.

340
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,236
There's a lot of places you can post,

341
00:14:18,476 --> 00:14:19,877
and I had to do it a lot.

342
00:14:20,157 --> 00:14:22,919
Like, just in one year, I posted 41 times on Imgur,

343
00:14:22,939 --> 00:14:25,980
and I'd say, like, most of those didn't do well,

344
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,102
but then a few would gain traction

345
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:29,422
and get on the front page of Imgur,

346
00:14:29,442 --> 00:14:31,984
and then that's what would help build up my wish list

347
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,105
and my email list.

348
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,541
So here's some examples of good Reddit posts that I posted.

349
00:14:37,421 --> 00:14:40,042
As a kid, I always dreamed of releasing a game

350
00:14:40,202 --> 00:14:41,143
on a Nintendo console.

351
00:14:41,183 --> 00:14:41,823
Today it happened.

352
00:14:43,844 --> 00:14:45,865
After two years of work and no knowledge of code,

353
00:14:46,145 --> 00:14:48,245
I still launched my Fox adventure game today,

354
00:14:48,265 --> 00:14:49,006
The First Tree.

355
00:14:51,547 --> 00:14:52,487
It doesn't seem like much,

356
00:14:52,567 --> 00:14:55,008
but getting footprints working in my game is huge for me,

357
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:56,288
which it really was.

358
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:00,627
And this one has kind of a comedy angle.

359
00:15:01,127 --> 00:15:03,068
Stress testing bunny herds in a game

360
00:15:03,108 --> 00:15:04,428
with unforeseen consequences.

361
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:10,310
That one was retweeted by David Bowie's son on Twitter.

362
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,491
So that got a lot of attention.

363
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:14,612
Here are some posts that didn't do well.

364
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:16,552
The first tree launch trailer,

365
00:15:16,772 --> 00:15:18,753
releasing on Steam September 14th.

366
00:15:21,194 --> 00:15:23,214
Super Fox, the first tree.

367
00:15:26,735 --> 00:15:28,156
Points of light towards the first tree.

368
00:15:29,682 --> 00:15:33,044
Some other things that helped me is I've never seen a post

369
00:15:33,145 --> 00:15:36,147
on the gaming server at DoWell that links to a store page

370
00:15:36,307 --> 00:15:38,629
or even a website, always link to a GIF.

371
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,932
And then in the comments you can have a call to action,

372
00:15:42,012 --> 00:15:43,774
just one link to your store page.

373
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:46,656
I've had comments removed for linking

374
00:15:46,676 --> 00:15:47,817
to too many store pages

375
00:15:48,017 --> 00:15:49,518
because it reeked of self-promotion.

376
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:53,122
And that leads me to a problem a lot of developers have

377
00:15:53,162 --> 00:15:54,983
with Reddit is the self-promotional rules.

378
00:15:56,012 --> 00:15:59,339
And I would say it just takes a little bit of preparation.

379
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,841
But that yes, you can use Reddit.

380
00:16:02,901 --> 00:16:05,162
You just need to create an account

381
00:16:05,262 --> 00:16:06,643
one to three months prior to your launch.

382
00:16:07,123 --> 00:16:10,064
Hopefully you're posting more before that.

383
00:16:11,285 --> 00:16:12,365
And you just have to remember that only 10%

384
00:16:12,725 --> 00:16:15,226
of your submissions can be about your project.

385
00:16:15,546 --> 00:16:16,407
Comments don't count.

386
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:17,747
You have to submit things.

387
00:16:18,067 --> 00:16:18,948
So that's what I did.

388
00:16:19,168 --> 00:16:19,868
I loved music.

389
00:16:20,068 --> 00:16:21,389
I loved the game dev subreddit.

390
00:16:21,789 --> 00:16:24,890
So I'd post once a day of stuff I liked

391
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,571
so that I was legal.

392
00:16:28,465 --> 00:16:30,106
And then I would say remember the call to action.

393
00:16:30,126 --> 00:16:33,188
I did do on my website, I did an email list

394
00:16:33,248 --> 00:16:35,069
that was like one time email, no spam.

395
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:37,291
I was a little worried, like I hate spam

396
00:16:37,411 --> 00:16:38,872
and I thought that would help get more emails

397
00:16:38,932 --> 00:16:40,774
but comparing my numbers to other developers,

398
00:16:41,174 --> 00:16:42,675
I didn't see any difference in that.

399
00:16:43,496 --> 00:16:45,597
So I would say just say you won't spam them

400
00:16:45,777 --> 00:16:46,658
and just get those emails

401
00:16:46,678 --> 00:16:47,879
because those are the people that,

402
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:49,360
those are your like dedicated fans

403
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,481
and they'll probably buy the game

404
00:16:50,521 --> 00:16:52,362
the first couple hours of launch.

405
00:16:54,236 --> 00:16:58,560
This is my website traffic, and this kind of shows you

406
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,242
what those marketing efforts did.

407
00:17:00,262 --> 00:17:04,726
Like, Imgur was nice, and it would happen pretty regularly.

408
00:17:05,287 --> 00:17:06,768
But of course, getting on the front page of Reddit,

409
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:07,970
that was a huge bump.

410
00:17:08,991 --> 00:17:09,511
Had 15,000 visits that day.

411
00:17:13,218 --> 00:17:19,067
Something I dropped the ball on is I should have had my Steam store page up by the time that viral Reddit post was up

412
00:17:19,648 --> 00:17:24,515
Because it came out a month later, and so my Steam store page could have got wishlist

413
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:28,120
And so yeah, that's why I need to get that Steam store page done ASAP

414
00:17:29,224 --> 00:17:31,506
So leading up to launch, these were my numbers,

415
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:34,628
and this was in 2017, indie game development,

416
00:17:34,668 --> 00:17:36,789
like the marketing world moves fast,

417
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:41,032
but my numbers were 12,000 Steam Wish lists,

418
00:17:41,372 --> 00:17:44,414
4,700 Twitter followers, 4,400 mailing list subscribers,

419
00:17:45,295 --> 00:17:47,256
1,300 Tumblr followers, and then I had 100,000 views

420
00:17:47,376 --> 00:17:48,517
on my YouTube trailer.

421
00:17:49,418 --> 00:17:51,339
And what that equated to was 11,000 sales my first week.

422
00:17:53,664 --> 00:17:57,571
And then that was also a 7% conversion rate of my wishlist,

423
00:17:58,292 --> 00:18:00,676
because I also gained an additional 50,000 wishlists

424
00:18:00,836 --> 00:18:02,959
for being on the new and trending tab for five days.

425
00:18:04,867 --> 00:18:08,089
So my social media blitz, what I was talking about earlier,

426
00:18:08,329 --> 00:18:11,691
was my plan was the biggest problem

427
00:18:11,931 --> 00:18:13,592
that my indie game could face

428
00:18:13,732 --> 00:18:15,193
is that it would fade into obscurity

429
00:18:15,454 --> 00:18:17,054
and would become invisible and get buried.

430
00:18:17,995 --> 00:18:20,697
So bug fixes were gonna wait, parties were gonna wait.

431
00:18:21,237 --> 00:18:23,078
My whole goal on launch day was just

432
00:18:23,718 --> 00:18:27,421
to get the visibility out there, to get people aware of it.

433
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:29,901
and I wasn't gonna stop until something stuck,

434
00:18:30,081 --> 00:18:31,922
which that Reddit GIF, it did stick,

435
00:18:32,222 --> 00:18:33,182
so that's when I took a break,

436
00:18:33,722 --> 00:18:36,342
but these were all low-time, high-impact strategies,

437
00:18:36,943 --> 00:18:38,603
and I was just really hoping for one of those things

438
00:18:38,643 --> 00:18:40,863
to push me over the edge to get on the new and trending tab.

439
00:18:42,423 --> 00:18:43,164
Now, you're probably saying,

440
00:18:43,224 --> 00:18:45,984
well, what if that big launch Reddit post failed?

441
00:18:46,384 --> 00:18:48,084
Well, I don't want you guys to get too bummed out

442
00:18:48,725 --> 00:18:50,665
because I was on the new and trending tab

443
00:18:50,685 --> 00:18:52,725
before that Reddit post took off, actually,

444
00:18:52,885 --> 00:18:53,825
which kind of surprised me,

445
00:18:54,446 --> 00:18:56,126
and I attribute that to my mailing list.

446
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:00,532
Those number one fans, they bought the game immediately.

447
00:19:00,552 --> 00:19:03,194
And just in the first hour, that made a difference.

448
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:06,916
If your gaming subreddit post fails,

449
00:19:07,196 --> 00:19:09,117
then I would encourage you to use smaller subreddits,

450
00:19:09,378 --> 00:19:11,399
like the Unity subreddit and Indie Gaming.

451
00:19:11,959 --> 00:19:12,940
That can drive traffic.

452
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,161
And just keep at it during all of launch day.

453
00:19:16,982 --> 00:19:21,565
So anyway, in conclusion, I started this as a hobbyist.

454
00:19:22,326 --> 00:19:25,108
I was doing it on the side while taking care of my family.

455
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:27,699
And it was interesting how one thing led to another,

456
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:29,181
like my successful Steam launch,

457
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:33,124
it led to me getting access to Switch publishing

458
00:19:33,144 --> 00:19:36,607
and helped me pay for porting the game,

459
00:19:36,627 --> 00:19:38,448
which led to a successful console launch.

460
00:19:39,449 --> 00:19:40,870
And now I wasn't planning on it,

461
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:42,772
but I was able to quit my job at The Void

462
00:19:42,972 --> 00:19:44,473
to be a full-time indie developer,

463
00:19:44,674 --> 00:19:45,915
which is amazing to me.

464
00:19:47,076 --> 00:19:47,376
Thank you.

465
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:52,701
I will say life isn't that different from when I was working at night.

466
00:19:53,122 --> 00:19:58,403
I'm actually like, I thought there would be a linear graph of my productivity from getting

467
00:19:58,443 --> 00:20:00,964
that much more time and it hasn't been that way.

468
00:20:00,984 --> 00:20:05,545
I feel like I was just as productive with 10 hours a week than I am with 40 hours.

469
00:20:06,386 --> 00:20:07,906
And so it's pretty cool.

470
00:20:08,326 --> 00:20:11,727
It just, there was one foot in front of the other and that's what led to me being a full

471
00:20:11,747 --> 00:20:12,628
time indie developer.

472
00:20:13,568 --> 00:20:17,889
And just doing it this way of what we talked about, it taught me a lot on what corners

473
00:20:17,949 --> 00:20:18,530
can be cut.

474
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:18,790
And when.

475
00:20:19,206 --> 00:20:21,888
what can't be cut, and how working to launch

476
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:22,949
makes all the difference.

477
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:28,113
And then I wanted to end with this quote

478
00:20:28,133 --> 00:20:28,933
from an anonymous player.

479
00:20:28,954 --> 00:20:30,855
I've gotten hundreds of emails from people

480
00:20:31,596 --> 00:20:34,498
who've really like, they've just shared how much the game meant

481
00:20:34,538 --> 00:20:34,818
to them.

482
00:20:35,959 --> 00:20:38,541
And this is what she said.

483
00:20:38,761 --> 00:20:40,923
Said, in that moment, it all resolved for me.

484
00:20:41,223 --> 00:20:43,685
Everything, the game, my life the last couple months,

485
00:20:44,365 --> 00:20:45,907
the loss of my mother, all of it.

486
00:20:46,385 --> 00:20:47,846
Thank you so much for the first tree,

487
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:49,307
for closure, for peace,

488
00:20:49,987 --> 00:20:51,308
for even if only in a video game

489
00:20:51,328 --> 00:20:52,348
and for the briefest moment,

490
00:20:52,408 --> 00:20:54,189
giving me a chance to speak to her again.

491
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:58,791
So, I guess you would say I'm begging you guys

492
00:20:58,811 --> 00:20:59,932
to finish your game,

493
00:21:00,752 --> 00:21:02,513
because other people need your game

494
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:04,674
just like other people needed the first tree.

495
00:21:05,254 --> 00:21:06,835
And I'm so glad I was able to finish that

496
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:07,796
and to share it with people.

497
00:21:08,856 --> 00:21:09,656
Thank you for listening.

498
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,741
I think we have time for a few questions.

499
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:31,310
Hi, I'm Garrett.

500
00:21:31,751 --> 00:21:32,692
Hi.

501
00:21:33,933 --> 00:21:39,058
So on your Reddit post, you said all of the very successful

502
00:21:39,439 --> 00:21:40,860
game launches are like.

503
00:21:42,025 --> 00:21:44,267
I've never made a game before.

504
00:21:44,287 --> 00:21:48,971
I did this in like two years or whatever.

505
00:21:49,631 --> 00:21:56,717
Did you use that title as intentionally as like this is

506
00:21:56,777 --> 00:21:58,058
like a formula sort of?

507
00:21:58,378 --> 00:22:00,560
Or was it more organic?

508
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,201
I would say it was organic.

509
00:22:02,861 --> 00:22:06,944
I will say people on Reddit, they know when

510
00:22:06,964 --> 00:22:07,665
you're being fake.

511
00:22:07,885 --> 00:22:09,226
They want you to be sincere.

512
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:13,053
And that was something I tried to focus on,

513
00:22:13,073 --> 00:22:14,415
was just, this came from my heart.

514
00:22:15,436 --> 00:22:16,658
I didn't try to follow a formula,

515
00:22:16,718 --> 00:22:18,640
but I think it's interesting to analyze that data.

516
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,441
Yeah.

517
00:22:19,902 --> 00:22:20,663
So, yeah.

518
00:22:21,023 --> 00:22:21,784
Thank you for your question.

519
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:24,488
I really like the art style of the game,

520
00:22:24,508 --> 00:22:26,771
I just wanted to ask you about how you achieved

521
00:22:26,791 --> 00:22:29,414
a pretty consistent art style while using stock assets.

522
00:22:30,486 --> 00:22:32,527
So, oh, I should be repeating the question.

523
00:22:33,488 --> 00:22:35,889
He asked, how did I make consistent art style

524
00:22:36,209 --> 00:22:38,070
with using public assets?

525
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:39,111
And that's a good question.

526
00:22:39,771 --> 00:22:42,553
I think it helps with me because I feel like I could make

527
00:22:42,753 --> 00:22:44,934
a lot of those assets as a technical artist

528
00:22:44,974 --> 00:22:47,416
and as a, you know, as a artist.

529
00:22:49,616 --> 00:22:53,239
But I was able to like, I just use it as a springboard

530
00:22:53,299 --> 00:22:54,020
to save time.

531
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,781
Like I'm not good at rigging, so I'd

532
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:58,063
buy like those animations with the fox.

533
00:22:58,403 --> 00:22:59,664
But I can change a texture map.

534
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:01,346
And so I was able to do that.

535
00:23:01,366 --> 00:23:03,627
I was able to change the trees to what I need

536
00:23:03,727 --> 00:23:07,350
and modify the rocks like that came in the asset pack.

537
00:23:07,931 --> 00:23:09,332
So I will say like it takes work.

538
00:23:09,552 --> 00:23:12,735
Like I needed to modify those assets,

539
00:23:12,835 --> 00:23:15,497
but it saved me time instead of making everything from scratch.

540
00:23:16,118 --> 00:23:16,838
Cool, thanks a lot.

541
00:23:16,878 --> 00:23:17,138
Thank you.

542
00:23:19,623 --> 00:23:21,965
And just to make sure I understood, oh, right.

543
00:23:23,386 --> 00:23:25,388
You do have it released on the Switch?

544
00:23:25,848 --> 00:23:26,049
Yes.

545
00:23:26,369 --> 00:23:26,649
OK.

546
00:23:26,669 --> 00:23:30,332
Then my question was, while it sounded like getting on the

547
00:23:30,352 --> 00:23:32,875
Steam page was what gave you access to releasing on the

548
00:23:32,895 --> 00:23:36,338
Switch store, I was just wondering what the comparison

549
00:23:36,378 --> 00:23:38,900
in buys was from the Steam store versus the Switch store.

550
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,701
Because you know, they're two very

551
00:23:39,741 --> 00:23:41,342
different audiences, usually.

552
00:23:42,023 --> 00:23:43,584
So you're asking about sales figures?

553
00:23:43,664 --> 00:23:43,884
Yeah.

554
00:23:45,008 --> 00:23:50,956
Um, Switch did well for me, and I've learned a lot about the console marketing efforts.

555
00:23:51,357 --> 00:23:56,224
With Steam, it's so, like, algorithm-driven, and with the consoles, there's people behind

556
00:23:56,344 --> 00:23:57,225
the games they feature.

557
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:01,302
So they give you opportunities to submit trailers to the

558
00:24:01,322 --> 00:24:04,424
official Nintendo YouTube channel and submit blog posts

559
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:05,164
for their websites.

560
00:24:06,605 --> 00:24:10,766
So I would say, yeah, they're a little different, but still

561
00:24:10,786 --> 00:24:11,967
getting that organic traffic.

562
00:24:12,447 --> 00:24:14,828
It boosts you on the top sellers list on the Switch

563
00:24:14,928 --> 00:24:15,348
eShop.

564
00:24:16,097 --> 00:24:18,019
And then that gets the attention of the marketing team

565
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:18,680
at Nintendo.

566
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,521
And then they were able to feature my game also

567
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:24,125
in top indie games of November or December or something.

568
00:24:24,645 --> 00:24:26,187
And so again, that helped a lot.

569
00:24:26,627 --> 00:24:29,350
It's just the point of the successful Steam launch

570
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:31,532
is to prove that, oh, my game has legs.

571
00:24:32,132 --> 00:24:33,674
And that's why they were able to take a risk

572
00:24:33,714 --> 00:24:34,955
and give me a valuable dev kit.

573
00:24:34,995 --> 00:24:36,236
Because, oh, the game did well on Steam.

574
00:24:36,256 --> 00:24:36,676
That's great.

575
00:24:37,797 --> 00:24:38,278
So thank you.

576
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:40,500
Hi.

577
00:24:41,261 --> 00:24:41,381
So.

578
00:24:42,405 --> 00:24:45,167
First of all, I was wondering, I haven't played your game.

579
00:24:45,347 --> 00:24:47,308
I think it looks great, but I haven't played it.

580
00:24:48,568 --> 00:24:50,089
You said that you have to compromise,

581
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:53,791
because of course, the scope of the game, that's natural.

582
00:24:54,932 --> 00:24:57,693
So how, how am I going to say it?

583
00:24:59,134 --> 00:25:00,475
Can I ask you a small question

584
00:25:00,515 --> 00:25:02,075
and a little longer question?

585
00:25:02,456 --> 00:25:02,696
Sure.

586
00:25:03,056 --> 00:25:04,457
Okay, so first of all,

587
00:25:06,472 --> 00:25:12,813
like how long was the average of um how long was the regain because of all this compromise?

588
00:25:13,534 --> 00:25:20,015
So uh yeah he asks if if I try to compromise a vision how long how long would it have been if I

589
00:25:20,055 --> 00:25:25,156
didn't compromise anything is that what you're asking? Or can you tell us both versions how

590
00:25:25,196 --> 00:25:31,497
long it would have been if you hadn't compromised and how long it is now? If I didn't have to

591
00:25:31,537 --> 00:25:34,798
compromise anything and then I got like a team of employees working for me

592
00:25:35,893 --> 00:25:40,034
I think I would have liked polished controls, I would have had more levels.

593
00:25:40,954 --> 00:25:44,795
Right now it's about two hours to complete, and I think four to five hours is good for

594
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:46,436
a consumable type of game like this.

595
00:25:49,076 --> 00:25:52,277
It is minimalistic gameplay, it's lots of exploration.

596
00:25:52,297 --> 00:25:56,839
I would have liked more puzzles in my game, and that was something I just didn't have

597
00:25:56,879 --> 00:25:57,619
time to polish.

598
00:25:59,075 --> 00:26:00,636
So I guess, yeah, that's the best way

599
00:26:00,656 --> 00:26:01,737
I can answer your question.

600
00:26:02,317 --> 00:26:03,398
Yes, one more thing.

601
00:26:04,699 --> 00:26:07,801
How much I, because I know you have been developing

602
00:26:07,961 --> 00:26:10,603
and marketing the game, how long,

603
00:26:11,063 --> 00:26:14,165
or when you started marketing your game,

604
00:26:15,166 --> 00:26:19,289
were you exclusively spending your time on market,

605
00:26:19,629 --> 00:26:22,851
or were you also marketing and developing at the same time?

606
00:26:22,871 --> 00:26:24,412
I was doing it at the same time,

607
00:26:24,613 --> 00:26:25,693
which I think's really important.

608
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:29,500
And that's why, like I said, visuals first, development style.

609
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,041
Like that's when you have something to show as early as possible.

610
00:26:32,722 --> 00:26:36,603
So I would spend about three hours a week marketing the game, and then about seven hours

611
00:26:36,663 --> 00:26:39,445
doing development and getting the game ready for prime time.

612
00:26:40,545 --> 00:26:40,805
Thank you.

613
00:26:40,845 --> 00:26:41,146
Yeah, thank you.

614
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:41,486
Thank you.

615
00:26:44,127 --> 00:26:45,328
Thank you for the insightful talk.

616
00:26:45,928 --> 00:26:46,228
Thank you.

617
00:26:46,548 --> 00:26:51,211
Did you maintain a personal Twitter and separate game Twitter, or one and the same?

618
00:26:51,371 --> 00:26:51,971
What's your reasoning?

619
00:26:53,578 --> 00:27:00,423
I didn't. I mean I had the same Twitter for both my game. I guess this guy gets into another

620
00:27:00,483 --> 00:27:05,066
topic of like, I love, I love like seeing games as like

621
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,720
You know, we have game studio names, which is fine.

622
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,381
That's awesome.

623
00:27:10,121 --> 00:27:12,061
But because it was a very personal story and a very

624
00:27:12,121 --> 00:27:14,322
personal game, I wanted to be with my name on it.

625
00:27:14,562 --> 00:27:17,483
Because it was my story, my voice acting.

626
00:27:17,963 --> 00:27:21,064
Also with the help of several assets, which was really

627
00:27:21,184 --> 00:27:22,704
amazing that these artists and programmers

628
00:27:23,164 --> 00:27:24,265
let people license it.

629
00:27:24,845 --> 00:27:26,265
But the story was written by me.

630
00:27:28,406 --> 00:27:30,466
I think it's fine to have a separate Twitter.

631
00:27:31,677 --> 00:27:34,640
especially if it's like your game studio and that future games will be coming out of it.

632
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:39,623
Because for me I expect that like my future games will still like be like personal stories

633
00:27:39,683 --> 00:27:43,526
from me. That's what I want. If I was like creating a new studio with friends I'd probably do

634
00:27:43,546 --> 00:27:48,250
something different. I keep that my personal one but yeah your mileage may vary of course.

635
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:49,531
Thank you. Thank you.

636
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:57,692
So your talk appealed a lot to me because I'm in the same boat, so thank you.

637
00:27:57,712 --> 00:27:58,573
You're welcome.

638
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:05,775
I want to ask you about the music and how you found the music that you were interested in,

639
00:28:06,475 --> 00:28:09,996
how you sort of like created the relationship with the actual musician

640
00:28:10,016 --> 00:28:13,197
and what medium you used to find that specific music.

641
00:28:14,089 --> 00:28:19,254
Sure. So Pond5, you know, as I come from a film editing background, so I'm very used to

642
00:28:19,334 --> 00:28:24,760
finding stock music available to license on Pond5 and Musicbed and Audio Jungle.

643
00:28:26,245 --> 00:28:27,826
There wasn't a personal connection at first.

644
00:28:27,846 --> 00:28:28,807
That's kind of the funny part.

645
00:28:29,527 --> 00:28:31,609
Josh Kramer, he had his library of music,

646
00:28:31,649 --> 00:28:33,250
his gorgeous orchestral music,

647
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:35,491
and again, it was really affordable.

648
00:28:36,292 --> 00:28:37,733
And so I was able to just find that,

649
00:28:37,753 --> 00:28:39,094
and I was like, oh, I like everything he does.

650
00:28:39,114 --> 00:28:41,255
I'm gonna buy all of his songs and put it in my game.

651
00:28:41,655 --> 00:28:43,396
And then he reached out to me afterwards,

652
00:28:43,436 --> 00:28:45,057
because he was like, oh, I'm seeing a lot of news articles

653
00:28:45,177 --> 00:28:46,739
with this game with my music in it.

654
00:28:47,339 --> 00:28:48,620
And I was like, is that okay with you?

655
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,300
He's like, of course.

656
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,821
Like, I put it on there to be licensed

657
00:28:50,841 --> 00:28:51,622
in projects like this.

658
00:28:52,542 --> 00:28:54,663
So specifically, I don't know, I just,

659
00:28:55,303 --> 00:28:56,863
it's almost like meditative for me to like,

660
00:28:57,023 --> 00:28:59,284
browse these asset libraries and just be like,

661
00:28:59,324 --> 00:29:00,384
oh, would that work in my game?

662
00:29:00,524 --> 00:29:01,104
Oh, would that work?

663
00:29:01,304 --> 00:29:02,004
Oh, that sounds good.

664
00:29:02,024 --> 00:29:03,344
So that's what I did.

665
00:29:03,364 --> 00:29:05,005
I just went through Pond5,

666
00:29:05,685 --> 00:29:08,766
and I also, I splurged on two songs from Musicbed,

667
00:29:08,786 --> 00:29:10,326
which they do like, bigger artists,

668
00:29:10,866 --> 00:29:12,626
and so two of the final songs in the game,

669
00:29:12,806 --> 00:29:14,507
which were more expensive, is from Musicbed.

670
00:29:15,327 --> 00:29:16,287
And I think it was worth it.

671
00:29:16,307 --> 00:29:17,627
The music's such an important part

672
00:29:17,667 --> 00:29:18,948
of a story-driven game like that.

673
00:29:19,688 --> 00:29:20,829
So yeah, that's all I did.

674
00:29:20,849 --> 00:29:22,771
I just looked around, Google searched.

675
00:29:24,633 --> 00:29:25,594
All right, thanks so much.

676
00:29:25,654 --> 00:29:26,214
Yeah, thank you.

677
00:29:29,177 --> 00:29:32,000
If a game was going to have audio or voice acting,

678
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:35,043
do you think that the GIF, if that was a big part of it,

679
00:29:35,603 --> 00:29:38,165
would the GIF still have the same amount of traction

680
00:29:38,346 --> 00:29:40,508
opposed to screenshots, do you think?

681
00:29:42,055 --> 00:29:45,217
Maybe, like, sometimes people would say online,

682
00:29:45,257 --> 00:29:47,219
I'd say, oh, like I love that,

683
00:29:47,259 --> 00:29:48,600
it looks like a desktop wallpaper,

684
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,721
I'm gonna save it to my computer,

685
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:51,602
and that works for a still screenshot.

686
00:29:52,622 --> 00:29:56,203
I think the movement, it inspires imagination.

687
00:29:56,743 --> 00:29:59,424
People say, we're talking about people

688
00:30:00,184 --> 00:30:02,144
who are a built-in fan base,

689
00:30:02,164 --> 00:30:03,985
people who love Journey and people who love Foxes.

690
00:30:04,465 --> 00:30:05,685
They would see the game and be like,

691
00:30:05,705 --> 00:30:06,946
oh, that looks like something I would like,

692
00:30:07,486 --> 00:30:08,766
and they would market it for myself.

693
00:30:09,726 --> 00:30:14,127
So yeah, I think still screenshots can still help you know,

694
00:30:14,407 --> 00:30:17,008
give you an idea of, oh, does this project have legs?

695
00:30:17,488 --> 00:30:18,548
Does it kinda gain traction?

696
00:30:20,129 --> 00:30:21,489
Do we have time for one more question?

00:30:23,618 --> 00:30:24,958
Okay, yeah, one more question.

698
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:32,260
Sorry, um, thanks for the talk, it was awesome. Um, you showed

699
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,861
both posts that like did really well as well as some ones that

700
00:30:35,901 --> 00:30:41,203
didn't. Was there a key underlying, uh, kind of thing

701
00:30:41,243 --> 00:30:44,844
that you saw of what made those posts not do as well as others?

702
00:30:46,686 --> 00:30:52,210
I think being, in my personal opinion, I think being too vague, it hurt the post.

703
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:57,855
I think like, not like having a human connection was important.

704
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,060
I think that's a cool thing that indies have,

705
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,442
that a AAA company can't really do,

706
00:31:03,502 --> 00:31:06,003
is you're like a friend next door making a game.

707
00:31:06,023 --> 00:31:08,304
You're not a company with a PR department

708
00:31:08,464 --> 00:31:09,785
trying to market a game.

709
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:11,466
And that gets people excited.

710
00:31:11,526 --> 00:31:13,207
People put themselves in your shoes.

711
00:31:13,267 --> 00:31:14,728
It's like, oh, he made a game.

712
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:16,689
That's my dream, is to make a game like he did.

713
00:31:17,229 --> 00:31:19,170
And they kinda wanna celebrate with you, too.

714
00:31:19,991 --> 00:31:21,732
And that's what happened, I noticed, was just...

715
00:31:22,872 --> 00:31:25,893
Being human, I think saying, this is my dream,

716
00:31:25,933 --> 00:31:28,414
because it was, to see my game on a Nintendo Switch.

717
00:31:29,014 --> 00:31:30,275
And it got people excited, and they

718
00:31:30,295 --> 00:31:31,235
wanted to celebrate with you.

719
00:31:31,255 --> 00:31:34,276
So yeah, I would say the human connection is most important.

720
00:31:35,616 --> 00:31:35,816
Thanks.

721
00:31:36,277 --> 00:31:36,497
Thanks.

722
00:31:36,737 --> 00:31:37,457
Thank you, everybody.

723
00:31:37,477 --> 00:31:38,097
Appreciate it.
