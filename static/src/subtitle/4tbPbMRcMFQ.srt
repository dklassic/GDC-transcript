1
00:00:04,287 --> 00:00:07,428
So my name is Matthew Vione. I'm a founder at SomaSim Games.

2
00:00:08,349 --> 00:00:08,789
And I'd like...

3
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:12,370
First, how many people saw me at FlashForward? I'm just curious.

4
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:14,290
Okay, a few.

5
00:00:16,751 --> 00:00:18,552
So I just want to start with a hypothetical.

6
00:00:19,092 --> 00:00:21,533
Let's say that you just put your job.

7
00:00:22,053 --> 00:00:23,453
You cashed out some savings,

8
00:00:24,054 --> 00:00:25,554
got rid of a 401k,

9
00:00:25,654 --> 00:00:27,775
convinced your spouse or significant other that

10
00:00:28,275 --> 00:00:30,256
one mortgage is good, but two is even better.

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,882
and you're gonna use that money to do a crazy or maybe stupid thing which is

12
00:00:35,922 --> 00:00:37,183
make your first indie game

13
00:00:37,943 --> 00:00:40,585
uh... so from that very first moment you're now on the clock

14
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:42,386
you gotta get that game done

15
00:00:42,806 --> 00:00:44,667
out there and making money before your money

16
00:00:45,207 --> 00:00:45,707
goes away

17
00:00:46,528 --> 00:00:50,390
uh... there's a lot of other stuff that you have to do and do well in that first

18
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:51,290
year that first

19
00:00:52,231 --> 00:00:53,251
while you're making that first game

20
00:00:53,271 --> 00:00:55,032
and that's what I'm gonna talk about today

21
00:00:55,492 --> 00:00:58,534
is all that other stuff that you need to do to make sure that your first indie game

22
00:00:58,734 --> 00:00:59,775
isn't your last indie game

23
00:01:02,467 --> 00:01:04,708
So we made our first indie game called 1849.

24
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:07,889
We released it in May of 2014.

25
00:01:08,629 --> 00:01:14,951
It is a city builder, sort of in the classic Caesar, Sierra

26
00:01:15,051 --> 00:01:18,491
impressions, late 90s, early 2000s genre of game, like

27
00:01:18,531 --> 00:01:21,392
where city builder and tycoon games sort of run

28
00:01:21,412 --> 00:01:21,932
into one another.

29
00:01:26,505 --> 00:01:28,126
And we've been planning to do this for a while.

30
00:01:28,626 --> 00:01:31,026
We really wanted to make our own game and make our own

31
00:01:31,086 --> 00:01:33,067
studio focused on making simulation games.

32
00:01:33,667 --> 00:01:34,407
So we planned.

33
00:01:34,447 --> 00:01:35,668
We talked to friends.

34
00:01:35,788 --> 00:01:38,948
We got all the information we possibly could, saved money,

35
00:01:39,989 --> 00:01:41,869
and really got ready to release our first indie game.

36
00:01:42,449 --> 00:01:46,010
And then in April of 2013, we quit our jobs.

37
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:46,730
Yay!

38
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:51,031
And our first question was, how much time do we have?

39
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:55,134
We have the savings realistically how much time do we have before that money

40
00:01:55,194 --> 00:01:57,956
runs out and we have to unfortunately go get real jobs again.

41
00:02:00,258 --> 00:02:03,320
And then how do we make this our first Indie game and not our only Indie game?

42
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:07,923
Like I said, we really wanted to focus on building a studio based on making these

43
00:02:07,943 --> 00:02:09,544
kinds of simulation games that we really like.

44
00:02:11,126 --> 00:02:15,249
So today I'm, this is basically what I'm going to talk about real fast, is the preparation,

45
00:02:15,289 --> 00:02:19,031
the self-marketing and the self-publishing that we did while we were making our game

46
00:02:19,071 --> 00:02:20,032
and while we were releasing it.

47
00:02:21,427 --> 00:02:24,010
And I'm going to have some help from some people who

48
00:02:25,191 --> 00:02:27,774
from the time when my country decided to go into the British Empire.

49
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:30,136
So, Ben is right here.

50
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:33,339
If you want to arrive at a given point, at a given time,

51
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:35,281
you have to plan your journey very carefully.

52
00:02:35,381 --> 00:02:38,064
If you don't do that, you're going to get lost and wander around in the woods.

53
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:44,660
So we had quit and we were talking about our big game design dreams.

54
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,801
And we had four or five games that we wanted to make, and we very quickly realized

55
00:02:49,281 --> 00:02:51,181
that they were just beyond the scope of a year.

56
00:02:51,661 --> 00:02:55,442
We talked about them and we just couldn't make them work to our vision in that year.

57
00:02:55,902 --> 00:02:57,483
So then we decided, let's flip that around.

58
00:02:57,983 --> 00:02:59,403
So we have about a year to make a game.

59
00:03:00,123 --> 00:03:04,984
What game can we make that we want to make that will inspire us can we make in one year?

60
00:03:06,568 --> 00:03:07,268
And we did pretty good.

61
00:03:08,549 --> 00:03:09,649
We planned for a year.

62
00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:11,230
We made it in about 14 months.

63
00:03:13,091 --> 00:03:15,132
The first thing I want to talk about is how we got to that

64
00:03:15,212 --> 00:03:19,233
plan on that one side of the slide.

65
00:03:20,974 --> 00:03:23,095
We used something called SWAG scheduling, which I think we

66
00:03:23,115 --> 00:03:24,536
took from some friends at Microsoft.

67
00:03:24,636 --> 00:03:27,177
And SWAG stands for Stupid Wild Ass Guess.

68
00:03:29,277 --> 00:03:31,859
The first step of making a stupid, wild-ass guest schedule

69
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:35,021
is you just cut up items into a week or larger.

70
00:03:36,021 --> 00:03:37,782
And again, it's stupid, wild-ass guests.

71
00:03:37,802 --> 00:03:38,743
Just go with your gut.

72
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:41,444
Approximate. Like, I thought,

73
00:03:42,465 --> 00:03:43,585
I think it's going to take about a month

74
00:03:43,686 --> 00:03:45,126
to write the scenarios for the game.

75
00:03:45,226 --> 00:03:46,567
So I said, it's going to take a month

76
00:03:46,587 --> 00:03:47,648
to write the scenarios for the game.

77
00:03:49,089 --> 00:03:50,770
And annotate with costs as well,

78
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,451
with benefits as well as costs.

79
00:03:52,511 --> 00:03:54,612
Like, we were making a campaign-based game,

80
00:03:54,672 --> 00:03:57,133
so that month on the scenarios was really important.

81
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:00,071
So it took a lot longer than other things, but

82
00:04:01,052 --> 00:04:01,792
crucial to the game.

83
00:04:02,913 --> 00:04:04,734
And make sure you multiply for relative risk.

84
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:08,416
If you look at each other and say, you know how to do that?

85
00:04:09,377 --> 00:04:09,617
No.

86
00:04:10,037 --> 00:04:10,337
Do you?

87
00:04:10,357 --> 00:04:11,198
Uh-uh.

88
00:04:11,738 --> 00:04:13,039
It's going to take longer than you think.

89
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,222
So give yourself more time for the, I don't know how to do

90
00:04:17,282 --> 00:04:18,883
that, part of the plan process.

91
00:04:22,036 --> 00:04:24,237
So then we broke everything up into these little chunks,

92
00:04:24,277 --> 00:04:27,139
and we put them on Post-its, and then put them on a bigger Post-it.

93
00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:29,120
Unfortunately, there weren't bigger Post-its,

94
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,560
otherwise we would have probably done that too.

95
00:04:31,721 --> 00:04:35,323
And then we sort of ran a meta little sum function on all of this.

96
00:04:35,863 --> 00:04:37,344
And lo and behold, we came up with

97
00:04:38,024 --> 00:04:39,645
about 16 months to make a game.

98
00:04:40,846 --> 00:04:41,686
That's longer than a year.

99
00:04:42,607 --> 00:04:45,248
Swag scheduling has a tool for that, and it is called Butchery.

100
00:04:46,413 --> 00:04:49,155
this is the unpleasant part of swag scheduling this is where you take the

101
00:04:49,195 --> 00:04:53,218
design you've lovingly crafted and needed and honed and then hack out big

102
00:04:53,258 --> 00:04:53,719
chunks of it

103
00:04:54,579 --> 00:04:57,262
that big pile of post-its in the bottom there

104
00:04:58,102 --> 00:04:59,443
over there, that sort of messy looking pile

105
00:04:59,824 --> 00:05:01,005
that's our multiplayer system

106
00:05:03,687 --> 00:05:05,949
we looked at it and said that's four months of work

107
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:10,172
sixteen minus four is twelve so unfortunately

108
00:05:10,592 --> 00:05:11,773
our beautiful multiplayer system

109
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:16,232
And do this early, because taking out a multiplayer system

110
00:05:16,252 --> 00:05:18,254
in a game and changing it to a pure single player,

111
00:05:18,434 --> 00:05:19,715
that's a big design decision.

112
00:05:19,755 --> 00:05:21,016
If we had done that six months in,

113
00:05:21,437 --> 00:05:23,078
we could have had a lot of stuff built in multiplayer

114
00:05:23,098 --> 00:05:24,279
that never see the light of day.

115
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,801
So butcher early, butcher often.

116
00:05:29,063 --> 00:05:32,346
And again, if you have a tight schedule, reduce risk.

117
00:05:32,726 --> 00:05:34,968
For us, that meant tech.

118
00:05:35,128 --> 00:05:38,191
We knew how to use Flash with our eyes closed,

119
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:41,133
blindfolded, in the dark.

120
00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:45,762
Not the sexiest tech in the world, and it wasn't Unity, which was the new hotness at the time.

121
00:05:47,943 --> 00:05:50,845
So, we just decided, let's not worry about learning a whole new engine.

122
00:05:50,965 --> 00:05:51,806
Let's do what we know.

123
00:05:52,066 --> 00:05:54,048
And that let us take some risks in some other places.

124
00:05:54,348 --> 00:05:55,989
Because we already knew the tech we were going to use.

125
00:05:57,452 --> 00:05:59,315
And you're probably going to have to have contract work done.

126
00:06:00,056 --> 00:06:02,039
Make sure that you hire carefully.

127
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:04,302
Hire friends. Hire friends of friends.

128
00:06:06,004 --> 00:06:06,925
If your gut tells you,

129
00:06:06,945 --> 00:06:09,128
that guy's a little cray-cray.

130
00:06:09,388 --> 00:06:11,431
Go with your gut. You don't have time for cray-cray

131
00:06:11,451 --> 00:06:12,252
when you only have a year.

132
00:06:13,138 --> 00:06:17,719
and there's a lot of documentation to keep up with contractors from tax forms to time sheets

133
00:06:18,459 --> 00:06:20,400
and checks, because contractors, they like money.

134
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,881
And managing contractors is a lot different than working with a co-worker.

135
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:29,242
If a co-worker goes off on a tangent, yeah, it's problematic, but it's not fatal.

136
00:06:29,842 --> 00:06:32,942
If you only have a year and a contractor's off doing some crazy stuff,

137
00:06:33,523 --> 00:06:36,923
that's your money and your year. So make sure that you stay on top of contractors.

138
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,963
I support incorporate right away. They let you sign documents

139
00:06:42,323 --> 00:06:43,945
as a corporation not as yourself.

140
00:06:45,646 --> 00:06:48,108
You can sign distribution agreements and all that other stuff as a corporation

141
00:06:48,129 --> 00:06:48,869
not as yourself

142
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:53,333
and get an accountant. Tax laws in every country are designed to just

143
00:06:53,694 --> 00:06:57,437
annoy and frustrate and these are people that specialize in annoyance and frustration.

144
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,921
So then we went and made a game.

145
00:07:03,018 --> 00:07:05,719
About nine months later, we were in beta or alpha.

146
00:07:06,099 --> 00:07:07,840
And I'm going to skip all of that.

147
00:07:10,701 --> 00:07:12,182
The ins and outs, trials and tribulations

148
00:07:12,222 --> 00:07:14,562
of making an indie simulation game were another talk.

149
00:07:16,463 --> 00:07:18,044
So, nine months later,

150
00:07:18,264 --> 00:07:20,845
and it's about time to start self-marketing and self-promoting.

151
00:07:21,505 --> 00:07:22,865
Tom Payne here is correct.

152
00:07:23,146 --> 00:07:26,367
Publicity is sort of voodoo black magic,

153
00:07:26,607 --> 00:07:29,248
and the black magic gets stronger all the time.

154
00:07:31,137 --> 00:07:35,178
Before that sort of nine month in three months from release window,

155
00:07:35,238 --> 00:07:37,719
we started doing things like building community from scratch.

156
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,820
And we started on social media.

157
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:46,322
Facebook is useless when you want to build a community.

158
00:07:46,862 --> 00:07:48,223
Unless you're willing to pay Facebook money,

159
00:07:48,403 --> 00:07:49,283
you're not going to get anywhere.

160
00:07:49,323 --> 00:07:51,344
There's no virality on Facebook anymore.

161
00:07:52,084 --> 00:07:55,165
Twitter isn't right above Facebook for one big reason,

162
00:07:55,245 --> 00:07:56,585
and that is journalists.

163
00:07:57,544 --> 00:07:59,165
Love Twitter.

164
00:07:59,885 --> 00:08:01,366
They spend all their time on Twitter.

165
00:08:01,446 --> 00:08:03,467
Some of them even have some compensation based on what

166
00:08:03,507 --> 00:08:04,688
they tweet and how they tweet.

167
00:08:04,748 --> 00:08:07,550
So that's a great place to find people who are covering

168
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:10,992
your game, your genre, and your people in the media.

169
00:08:13,273 --> 00:08:14,414
Reddit can be dangerous.

170
00:08:15,274 --> 00:08:17,476
One day we decided, ooh, a new subreddit that looks like

171
00:08:17,496 --> 00:08:18,396
it's great for our game.

172
00:08:18,656 --> 00:08:21,518
Here's a screenshot and some stuff about the game.

173
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:23,739
10 minutes later, it was gone.

174
00:08:25,461 --> 00:08:27,023
seems to fit, why didn't it go away?

175
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:28,384
So we asked the Redditor, what's up?

176
00:08:28,484 --> 00:08:29,945
And he said, not now.

177
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,809
So then we asked, oh, well, can you tell us some pointers?

178
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:35,431
Like, what could we do to fit in more with the community?

179
00:08:35,451 --> 00:08:37,273
And he said, not now.

180
00:08:38,474 --> 00:08:41,517
So make sure you get to know the Reddit you're posting in.

181
00:08:41,717 --> 00:08:43,919
Even post there, get to know that community before you do.

182
00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:46,081
Otherwise, you could get not now.

183
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:52,116
We also started a dev log, and we began showing that on TIG

184
00:08:52,136 --> 00:08:54,337
Source, cross-posting on Reddit.

185
00:08:54,938 --> 00:08:57,339
It was a really good way of getting our screenshots out

186
00:08:57,359 --> 00:08:58,800
there, information about our game out there

187
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,721
to a wider community.

188
00:09:00,622 --> 00:09:02,823
Doing email and having a mailing list is really

189
00:09:02,863 --> 00:09:05,365
important, because these are people who came to your site,

190
00:09:06,165 --> 00:09:08,567
found your sign-up form, put in their name, put in their

191
00:09:08,627 --> 00:09:09,208
email address.

192
00:09:09,608 --> 00:09:10,649
They want to hear from you.

193
00:09:10,789 --> 00:09:14,551
So use your email list sparingly and communicate

194
00:09:14,591 --> 00:09:17,013
efficiently, and it's a really great tool of getting your

195
00:09:17,053 --> 00:09:17,533
game out there.

196
00:09:19,346 --> 00:09:22,787
Screenshot Saturday was also a fantastic way of getting things in front of people.

197
00:09:22,907 --> 00:09:25,487
If you don't know about Screenshot Saturday, you should know about Screenshot Saturday.

198
00:09:25,687 --> 00:09:27,168
And it also starts on Friday, not Saturday.

199
00:09:29,668 --> 00:09:31,889
Every time we had new art that came in, we put it up.

200
00:09:31,929 --> 00:09:33,929
Every time we had a new game feature, we talked about it.

201
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:37,670
Probably a couple of times a month seemed to us to be about the right time,

202
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:40,071
the right amount of time to share on Screenshot Saturday.

203
00:09:42,138 --> 00:09:44,299
And then it comes to doing press outreach and PR.

204
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,121
In a past life, I was a director of communications.

205
00:09:47,561 --> 00:09:49,322
And I know what it takes to do PR.

206
00:09:49,342 --> 00:09:50,223
It's a full-time job.

207
00:09:50,503 --> 00:09:51,564
And I'm a new developer now.

208
00:09:51,604 --> 00:09:52,765
So I have like five of those.

209
00:09:53,405 --> 00:09:55,727
So we found a really good contractor to

210
00:09:55,767 --> 00:09:56,707
handle some of our PR.

211
00:09:57,508 --> 00:09:59,649
But that still means that there's a lot of work that

212
00:09:59,669 --> 00:10:00,390
you have to do on your end.

213
00:10:01,409 --> 00:10:04,110
The first thing to do is come up with a really tight elevator pitch.

214
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:07,870
Um, these few words took about two months of work,

215
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:10,591
repeating them to ourselves in the mirror in the shower,

216
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,331
to friends, to like, they were like,

217
00:10:12,391 --> 00:10:14,311
yeah, I know what your game is, already stop talking to me.

218
00:10:14,991 --> 00:10:18,052
Um, and 1849 is a city management game

219
00:10:18,152 --> 00:10:19,412
set in the California gold rush.

220
00:10:19,632 --> 00:10:22,073
It's quick, it's concise, and it's modifiable.

221
00:10:22,533 --> 00:10:24,333
So if we're talking to the mobile press,

222
00:10:24,413 --> 00:10:27,013
we can say 1849 is a city management game

223
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:30,254
for tablets set in the California gold rush.

224
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:37,564
One thing that I would avoid is mentioning other games in your elevator pitch.

225
00:10:38,264 --> 00:10:40,966
At this conference, about five people have come to me to tell me about their game,

226
00:10:41,726 --> 00:10:43,507
mentioning other games that I have never heard of.

227
00:10:43,947 --> 00:10:45,408
So I have no idea what their game is now.

228
00:10:45,548 --> 00:10:48,250
And you're also running a risk, like, what if I hate one of those games?

229
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:52,653
So, just be clear on your pitch.

230
00:10:54,031 --> 00:10:56,853
And game media, this is where you should start.

231
00:10:57,414 --> 00:11:01,057
These are the trendsetters, tastemakers in our medium.

232
00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:04,601
Get to know who covers your genre.

233
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:05,662
Talk to them.

234
00:11:06,242 --> 00:11:07,544
Follow them on Twitter.

235
00:11:09,045 --> 00:11:12,588
We were greenlit about four days after we got featured on

236
00:11:12,628 --> 00:11:13,469
Raw Paper Shotgun.

237
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,131
I don't think that's a coincidence.

238
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:22,153
YouTubers, as anybody who's been at this conference probably knows,

239
00:11:22,253 --> 00:11:25,556
are a big and increasingly important way of getting your game out there.

240
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:28,579
I'm not going to talk about the ins and outs of YouTubers,

241
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:32,222
but one of the things that is really nice about YouTube

242
00:11:32,303 --> 00:11:34,905
is that it advertises your game in a way that screenshots can't.

243
00:11:35,426 --> 00:11:37,087
People can see the motion of your game.

244
00:11:37,127 --> 00:11:38,528
They can see what things do.

245
00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:40,470
They can see how the UI works.

246
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:43,753
And that really gets them into your game in a way that a screenshot or text just can't.

247
00:11:44,957 --> 00:11:48,519
One other thing is we used some YouTube, we reached out to some YouTubers during early access

248
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,880
and for us it was really valuable to see

249
00:11:51,761 --> 00:11:55,163
our game being played by other people in early access. We got to see them do things that we

250
00:11:55,443 --> 00:11:57,484
had never seen any playtesters do. We're like,

251
00:11:57,904 --> 00:12:00,386
why are they clicking over there? Why are they building it like that?

252
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:03,668
It was a really educational process during early access.

253
00:12:06,315 --> 00:12:07,636
And then there's the non-game media.

254
00:12:07,736 --> 00:12:10,498
And I think reaching out to the non-gaming media gets

255
00:12:10,638 --> 00:12:12,359
ignored in our industry to our own peril.

256
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:18,163
Our game is set in 20 real cities in California and six

257
00:12:18,263 --> 00:12:19,384
real cities in Nevada.

258
00:12:20,245 --> 00:12:24,888
So we reached out to the media, radio stations,

259
00:12:25,108 --> 00:12:29,251
newspapers, TV stations, in every market where our game

260
00:12:30,219 --> 00:12:32,941
has said it in every city or game is set

261
00:12:33,641 --> 00:12:36,683
and we did things like hey we made a game that has stopped in it isn't that

262
00:12:36,744 --> 00:12:38,345
cool and the starting record said

263
00:12:38,945 --> 00:12:42,948
and it's really cool and we got our game above the masthead and

264
00:12:43,228 --> 00:12:46,850
stocking record and then a full parade spread inside so we talked people from

265
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:49,532
the Sacramento Beach Nevada magazine to

266
00:12:50,273 --> 00:12:53,455
the Marysville Mountain Gazette which was big hit

267
00:12:53,915 --> 00:12:57,037
um and it was actually a lot of fun to talk to these

268
00:12:57,297 --> 00:12:59,739
non-game media reporters

269
00:13:00,594 --> 00:13:03,597
So find out, like, what is a hook in your game

270
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:04,838
that the media might be interested in

271
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:05,919
and pitch it to them.

272
00:13:05,999 --> 00:13:07,380
You get a lot more coverage that way.

273
00:13:09,402 --> 00:13:11,744
We also did early access and Greenlight at the same time.

274
00:13:11,864 --> 00:13:15,507
So, obviously, we weren't in early access on Steam.

275
00:13:16,988 --> 00:13:18,750
We did it on a site called Indie Game Stand.

276
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:21,672
And we had a lot of success doing early access this way.

277
00:13:24,618 --> 00:13:26,839
We got to really work with that community that they have there.

278
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:30,661
We would, we basically had a game that was system complete,

279
00:13:30,821 --> 00:13:33,402
but we still had a lot of scenarios to author and content to write.

280
00:13:33,502 --> 00:13:36,143
So we would put out chunks of content and say,

281
00:13:36,403 --> 00:13:38,804
fun, broken, just plain sucks.

282
00:13:39,504 --> 00:13:41,786
And they got back to us and then we released more content.

283
00:13:42,186 --> 00:13:44,006
And we actually really enjoyed building our game

284
00:13:44,047 --> 00:13:45,427
with this smaller community like that.

285
00:13:45,627 --> 00:13:48,148
And even next time when we do early access,

286
00:13:48,569 --> 00:13:50,649
we are probably going to start with this community

287
00:13:50,689 --> 00:13:52,070
and not with the Steam community.

288
00:13:53,071 --> 00:13:57,599
The Steam community has high expectations of polish and

289
00:13:58,901 --> 00:14:03,168
refinement in your game, and so we're going to try to get that right in early access elsewhere,

290
00:14:03,248 --> 00:14:06,373
and then maybe do a short period of early access on Steam.

291
00:14:08,553 --> 00:14:11,194
shows and expo's are great if your game has a controller

292
00:14:11,715 --> 00:14:14,156
if it's multiplayer, if it has VR

293
00:14:14,857 --> 00:14:20,820
if you have a simulation game with a tutorial that takes 8 minutes if you're the designer and don't have to read it

294
00:14:21,341 --> 00:14:23,642
and really about half an hour to get into the meat of the game

295
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:26,984
shows and expo's might not be the best place for you to show off your game

296
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:31,993
We did a few of them, and they were great experiences,

297
00:14:32,073 --> 00:14:33,634
but not really right for our game.

298
00:14:33,654 --> 00:14:36,036
So if they're not right for your game, don't feel like

299
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:39,158
because everybody goes to PAX East, you have to be on the

300
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:40,038
plane to PAX East.

301
00:14:44,181 --> 00:14:45,141
So we did all of that.

302
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:50,934
PR, all of our marketing, and then it came time to see if it was all worth it and gonna work.

303
00:14:51,514 --> 00:14:54,136
It came time for us to release our game, and

304
00:14:54,756 --> 00:14:56,377
we did a multi-platform,

305
00:14:57,557 --> 00:14:58,398
a cross-platform,

306
00:14:59,418 --> 00:15:01,739
multi-platform release simultaneously.

307
00:15:04,241 --> 00:15:06,522
We sent out a media story that said,

308
00:15:06,562 --> 00:15:10,344
we made a simulation game that you can play on your tablet and on your PC.

309
00:15:10,964 --> 00:15:11,744
Isn't that awesome?

310
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:15,268
And the PC players, a vocal small minority of them,

311
00:15:15,288 --> 00:15:16,829
said, no, it's a mobile port.

312
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:17,669
Gross.

313
00:15:18,889 --> 00:15:22,270
And the mobile audience, like, cool PC game.

314
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,511
We're like, we don't care if it's a cool PC game.

315
00:15:23,531 --> 00:15:24,271
Is it a cool mobile game?

316
00:15:24,711 --> 00:15:28,032
And lesson learned from this is that

317
00:15:28,072 --> 00:15:29,873
if you're doing a cross-platform launch,

318
00:15:30,373 --> 00:15:32,974
make sure you have two distinct game stories,

319
00:15:33,154 --> 00:15:35,674
one for the PC audience, one for the mobile audience.

320
00:15:37,055 --> 00:15:40,196
We're gonna spend a lot more time customizing our UI, UX.

321
00:15:41,402 --> 00:15:45,064
for mobile and for PC to make sure that we're really

322
00:15:45,584 --> 00:15:47,526
speaking to the strengths and the expectations

323
00:15:47,566 --> 00:15:48,486
of both audiences.

324
00:15:52,248 --> 00:15:54,049
That sort of leads into picking a price point.

325
00:15:54,609 --> 00:15:56,770
When you're on PC, on Steam,

326
00:15:56,971 --> 00:15:59,912
you have the luxury of really being able to charge

327
00:16:00,012 --> 00:16:01,933
what you think your game is worth.

328
00:16:02,674 --> 00:16:05,575
You can go hunt about and see other similar games

329
00:16:05,655 --> 00:16:06,576
in your genre.

330
00:16:07,456 --> 00:16:09,157
Um, you can...

331
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,371
really price appropriately.

332
00:16:14,013 --> 00:16:15,354
Mobile pricing sucks nuts.

333
00:16:19,136 --> 00:16:20,738
You can charge $6.99 for your game

334
00:16:20,878 --> 00:16:22,679
if you're a Minecraft or Final Fantasy

335
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,460
Final Fantasy game.

336
00:16:25,121 --> 00:16:26,522
I mean, what kind of universe do we live in

337
00:16:26,562 --> 00:16:27,583
when a Final Fantasy game costs $8?

338
00:16:27,683 --> 00:16:29,864
I mean, it's a crazy time.

339
00:16:32,927 --> 00:16:34,468
But we all know that most of these games

340
00:16:35,749 --> 00:16:35,869
are.

341
00:16:38,252 --> 00:16:42,873
99 cents, the huge variety of those 500 games that are coming out every day on mobile

342
00:16:43,374 --> 00:16:45,154
are free or incredibly cheap.

343
00:16:45,994 --> 00:16:50,375
I don't know about you guys, but I can't run a studio on games that cost 99 cents.

344
00:16:52,176 --> 00:16:55,277
This is all a lead-in to what I call the Kobayashi Maru.

345
00:16:55,437 --> 00:16:57,917
It's the no-win scenario of cross-platform pricing.

346
00:17:02,169 --> 00:17:06,731
You can pick a price point on mobile that's close to your price point on PC

347
00:17:07,212 --> 00:17:08,973
if you're interested in something no games at all.

348
00:17:10,873 --> 00:17:11,694
Or you can

349
00:17:13,155 --> 00:17:15,116
really reduce the price of your PC game,

350
00:17:15,176 --> 00:17:17,877
but then that's not what your PC game is worth.

351
00:17:17,997 --> 00:17:21,159
You did that price analysis on Steam and determined it's worth $15.

352
00:17:22,019 --> 00:17:23,340
So why would you not charge $15 for it?

353
00:17:27,253 --> 00:17:31,415
I don't really have a good answer for how you can do a cross-platform pricing.

354
00:17:32,215 --> 00:17:33,416
Um, except that...

355
00:17:34,897 --> 00:17:36,157
justify your PC price.

356
00:17:36,358 --> 00:17:39,319
Give the PC player something that the mobile players don't have.

357
00:17:39,719 --> 00:17:43,121
Or break out your content for mobile such that,

358
00:17:43,581 --> 00:17:46,263
eventually, to get all the content that they would get on PC,

359
00:17:46,323 --> 00:17:48,444
they are paying somewhere near that price.

360
00:17:49,144 --> 00:17:49,384
Um...

361
00:17:51,005 --> 00:17:54,867
Cross-platform pricing is just sort of an unpleasant situation.

362
00:17:57,223 --> 00:17:59,606
And it's important to go on really all the stores that you can.

363
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:06,495
These are our revenue sources for 2014.

364
00:18:06,556 --> 00:18:08,358
We made about 60% of our revenue on PC

365
00:18:08,418 --> 00:18:09,339
and about 40% on mobile.

366
00:18:15,909 --> 00:18:18,089
And really, that 40% on mobile,

367
00:18:18,129 --> 00:18:19,790
if we hadn't have done a cross-platform release,

368
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:22,251
is probably the difference between us making our second game

369
00:18:22,531 --> 00:18:23,712
and not making our second game.

370
00:18:24,192 --> 00:18:27,593
So it was important for us to be on both platforms.

371
00:18:28,814 --> 00:18:32,295
I think the best practice now is PC first.

372
00:18:32,955 --> 00:18:35,896
Use that to build up some audience for your mobile game.

373
00:18:36,797 --> 00:18:38,097
And then release on mobile later,

374
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:40,698
after you've had the time to really work out the kinks

375
00:18:40,738 --> 00:18:41,598
for a mobile release.

376
00:18:42,139 --> 00:18:43,699
They're a lot more complicated than a PC release

377
00:18:43,739 --> 00:18:44,240
a lot of the time.

378
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:47,181
Just a little further breakdown.

379
00:18:47,942 --> 00:18:48,122
Um...

380
00:18:48,983 --> 00:18:50,405
About 40%-45% of our, uh, PC revenue

381
00:18:50,425 --> 00:18:51,166
came straight from Steam.

382
00:18:51,186 --> 00:18:51,226
Um...

383
00:18:51,246 --> 00:18:52,387
Android and...

384
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:02,197
was 10% and then iOS was 30%.

385
00:19:02,397 --> 00:19:04,038
This year, we're seeing the Android

386
00:19:04,158 --> 00:19:06,840
come a lot closer to, um, the iOS,

387
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,001
and my guess is that those start to converge

388
00:19:09,021 --> 00:19:10,382
and get closer as time goes on.

389
00:19:11,222 --> 00:19:13,023
And also, if you look at that Indie Game Stand number,

390
00:19:13,223 --> 00:19:15,444
um, Indie Game Stand is a smaller, uh, small,

391
00:19:15,464 --> 00:19:17,205
it's a fairly small store and community,

392
00:19:17,225 --> 00:19:20,127
but you really see the impact that our community building

393
00:19:20,207 --> 00:19:21,607
and our work with their community

394
00:19:21,988 --> 00:19:23,368
had on our sales on Indie Game Stand.

395
00:19:23,388 --> 00:19:24,949
They're still even, what,

396
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,850
eight, nine months from release,

397
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:28,111
a big chunk of our revenues.

398
00:19:32,118 --> 00:19:32,719
We got featured.

399
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:33,700
Yay!

400
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,061
Both Apple and Android.

401
00:19:36,682 --> 00:19:38,803
Um, but we're a $4 title.

402
00:19:39,383 --> 00:19:39,604
$5 title.

403
00:19:40,064 --> 00:19:41,605
Um, I know how much my game is, really.

404
00:19:42,145 --> 00:19:45,788
Um, and so that meant we got released,

405
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:49,510
and we were up there for the period of our featuring.

406
00:19:49,831 --> 00:19:51,752
And because we were a more expensive title,

407
00:19:52,172 --> 00:19:54,334
we didn't have the momentum,

408
00:19:54,554 --> 00:19:57,296
the buzz that Apple looks for to repeat the featuring.

409
00:19:57,356 --> 00:20:00,078
So it was really great in getting our, um...

410
00:20:01,349 --> 00:20:05,191
first spike of sales up there while we were new and spreading some word of mouth, but

411
00:20:05,711 --> 00:20:07,912
it wasn't like raining money because we got featured, unfortunately.

412
00:20:09,312 --> 00:20:14,915
And getting featured isn't like black magic. Apple and Google have business, biz dev guys

413
00:20:14,935 --> 00:20:17,116
who go out and work for games that really showcase their platform.

414
00:20:18,456 --> 00:20:21,838
So we just found a biz dev guy that knows their biz dev guys. We said, can you talk

415
00:20:21,858 --> 00:20:24,059
about our game to them? And they said, sure. And we got featured.

416
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,064
There are a few annoying things.

417
00:20:27,084 --> 00:20:29,606
You just have to make sure that you follow all the

418
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:30,407
platform rules.

419
00:20:30,447 --> 00:20:32,388
Like for us, that meant the annoying back button on

420
00:20:32,448 --> 00:20:35,531
Android was a lot of work to get to do what Google thinks

421
00:20:35,571 --> 00:20:36,832
the back button on Android should do.

422
00:20:36,892 --> 00:20:38,553
So just be warned for little pitfalls like that.

423
00:20:41,835 --> 00:20:43,156
So then you release your game.

424
00:20:43,497 --> 00:20:46,259
And this is really, you know, it's the hockey stick.

425
00:20:46,299 --> 00:20:48,040
It's what you hope for and dread at the same time.

426
00:20:48,641 --> 00:20:50,522
So you, yay, release the Kraken.

427
00:20:50,602 --> 00:20:51,223
Game's out there.

428
00:20:52,925 --> 00:20:59,049
Then over the first few weeks, over the first week or so, you see it go like this as you fall off the front pages as

429
00:21:00,349 --> 00:21:05,392
the buzz dies down. And now it is your job, unfortunately, to flog the tail forever and ever and ever.

430
00:21:08,774 --> 00:21:12,275
Those little bumps are the regular sails that you see go on.

431
00:21:13,616 --> 00:21:16,358
Just make sure that you're in them. They're not automatic, you have to opt in.

432
00:21:17,938 --> 00:21:21,460
And they're a natural way of getting your game out there and increasing the tail.

433
00:21:24,945 --> 00:21:28,146
That little bump right there was our DLC launch.

434
00:21:28,426 --> 00:21:30,086
And it was a nice little bump in sales.

435
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,667
But really, I think the impact of the DLC

436
00:21:32,707 --> 00:21:35,748
was if you look at the level of the tail after the DLC,

437
00:21:35,808 --> 00:21:38,249
like that sort of base level.

438
00:21:38,869 --> 00:21:40,770
And then before, you'll see how it's come up.

439
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:46,551
So the DLC really helped to get just to raise the tide.

440
00:21:50,294 --> 00:21:51,675
And that one actually just happened.

441
00:21:51,715 --> 00:21:52,755
And this was cool.

442
00:21:52,775 --> 00:21:54,556
This was our first out-of-band sale.

443
00:21:54,576 --> 00:21:55,816
Like, there was nothing else on sale.

444
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:56,657
And it's February.

445
00:21:56,677 --> 00:21:58,177
And, like, it's a slow month.

446
00:21:59,178 --> 00:22:02,519
And there's sort of a reservoir of wish lists

447
00:22:02,579 --> 00:22:04,540
and recommendations that people build up in their queue.

448
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,381
And then you go on sale when there's not a lot going on.

449
00:22:07,401 --> 00:22:09,481
And all of a sudden, you have your best month since launch.

450
00:22:10,582 --> 00:22:13,223
So, you know, just be aware that that can be powerful.

451
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:16,964
And don't schedule it during Christmas.

452
00:22:21,479 --> 00:22:23,460
Another part of flogging the tail can be ads.

453
00:22:24,481 --> 00:22:26,642
We did some ads when there was nothing going on.

454
00:22:26,662 --> 00:22:28,583
We had nothing to announce, nothing to say, other than

455
00:22:29,043 --> 00:22:29,643
play our game.

456
00:22:29,663 --> 00:22:31,564
And those didn't really do so great.

457
00:22:33,365 --> 00:22:36,327
We found that when we treated ads as a communication device,

458
00:22:37,087 --> 00:22:40,249
when we had something to say, when we had some kind of

459
00:22:40,349 --> 00:22:42,290
urgency, they really started to work better.

460
00:22:43,771 --> 00:22:48,374
So on sale, 40% off, new game, play now.

461
00:22:49,015 --> 00:22:52,517
This one performed pretty well because it had an urgency and

462
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:53,738
it had a message to communicate.

463
00:22:54,338 --> 00:22:56,880
And also, ads are you talking.

464
00:22:57,381 --> 00:22:59,782
Yeah, you're paying for it, but there are you talking to

465
00:22:59,822 --> 00:23:00,643
a community of people.

466
00:23:01,203 --> 00:23:03,325
So make sure that your ads are consistent with your voice.

467
00:23:04,325 --> 00:23:06,627
And for us, that meant bad puns.

468
00:23:07,127 --> 00:23:10,970
The game writer, me, really liked these kind of terrible

469
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,611
puns like these.

470
00:23:13,572 --> 00:23:16,633
um, ready for a minor distraction or loads of fun.

471
00:23:19,155 --> 00:23:20,575
We found that the more that we went,

472
00:23:21,015 --> 00:23:23,437
oh god, that's bad, while we were writing them,

473
00:23:23,657 --> 00:23:25,318
the better they performed. So, like,

474
00:23:25,338 --> 00:23:29,880
the ready for minor distraction ad did great.

475
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,001
We also had fully loaded simulation

476
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:33,642
and a whole bunch of other bad load puns.

477
00:23:36,283 --> 00:23:36,883
And then really it's...

478
00:23:38,598 --> 00:23:39,278
Just keep at it.

479
00:23:40,818 --> 00:23:43,819
Reviews and ratings are important.

480
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,640
You can't really respond to player reviews, but just try

481
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,401
to keep on top of them.

482
00:23:51,661 --> 00:23:54,861
If you see that you're at that cusp between mixed and mostly

483
00:23:54,921 --> 00:23:57,682
positive, see what you can do to get it into mostly positive.

484
00:23:57,702 --> 00:23:59,182
It helps your sales a great deal.

485
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:03,723
We had some people on our Steam forums and community say,

486
00:24:03,783 --> 00:24:04,964
can we have trading cards?

487
00:24:06,164 --> 00:24:07,064
Sure, you can have trading cards.

488
00:24:07,558 --> 00:24:10,340
I don't know if I can quantify that it bumped sales any,

489
00:24:10,821 --> 00:24:11,802
but I know it helped the community.

490
00:24:11,822 --> 00:24:13,683
We had a lot of people, ooh, trading cards, cool, thank you.

491
00:24:15,944 --> 00:24:18,266
We also noticed that we were selling a lot of games

492
00:24:18,326 --> 00:24:20,768
in Germany, but our game was only in English.

493
00:24:21,528 --> 00:24:24,531
So we did a German localization, and Germany

494
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:27,533
went from being sort of three or four in sales

495
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:30,055
to being a really strong number two behind the United States.

496
00:24:30,095 --> 00:24:32,596
We sell more games in Germany than we do anywhere except

497
00:24:32,616 --> 00:24:33,077
the US.

498
00:24:34,077 --> 00:24:34,958
And then we also noticed that.

499
00:24:35,905 --> 00:24:37,946
People in France weren't playing our game very much.

500
00:24:38,927 --> 00:24:40,447
France is a big country with a big economy

501
00:24:40,467 --> 00:24:41,788
and a lot of people and a lot of gamers.

502
00:24:42,428 --> 00:24:44,829
So we said, let's try localizing our game in French

503
00:24:45,389 --> 00:24:46,250
and see how that does.

504
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:49,351
And that just came out on February 13th,

505
00:24:49,491 --> 00:24:50,832
so we don't have a lot of solid data,

506
00:24:50,892 --> 00:24:53,393
but so far, anecdotally, it looks like we're doing

507
00:24:53,453 --> 00:24:55,514
very well in France and French-speaking countries.

508
00:24:58,315 --> 00:25:00,456
So we are indeed making game number two.

509
00:25:01,036 --> 00:25:02,397
We sort of did all these things,

510
00:25:02,497 --> 00:25:04,818
and we are making our second indie game.

511
00:25:06,149 --> 00:25:07,949
You can go check it out.

512
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:11,731
It's very early in the prototype phase,

513
00:25:11,771 --> 00:25:14,252
and we hope to be talking about it next GDC.

514
00:25:15,172 --> 00:25:19,334
Um, so that's about all I have today.

515
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:21,895
I have some Steam keys for 1849 up here

516
00:25:21,915 --> 00:25:23,076
if anybody wants one afterwards.

517
00:25:24,016 --> 00:25:26,737
Um, so yeah, if anybody has any questions,

518
00:25:28,078 --> 00:25:29,878
come to the center, and I'll try my best to answer.

519
00:25:42,514 --> 00:25:42,634
Hi.

520
00:25:43,295 --> 00:25:43,515
Yes.

521
00:25:44,655 --> 00:25:46,957
You mentioned that going to expos wasn't a great way to get

522
00:25:47,417 --> 00:25:48,878
test plays on your simulation games.

523
00:25:48,898 --> 00:25:52,040
Did you find a venue to find test players for a sim game

524
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,141
that's more appropriate?

525
00:25:53,961 --> 00:25:54,341
Yeah.

526
00:25:54,421 --> 00:25:56,383
Early access, like I said, was a great help because.

527
00:25:57,496 --> 00:26:00,858
people played our game a lot there. We also bothered a lot of our friends and family

528
00:26:01,298 --> 00:26:02,859
that are also into simulation games.

529
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:07,001
The email list helped too. People came to us and said,

530
00:26:07,321 --> 00:26:09,082
cool game, how can I help? How can I be involved?

531
00:26:09,503 --> 00:26:10,943
We said, you want to playtest a broken game?

532
00:26:12,464 --> 00:26:13,465
That was a really good way of doing it.

533
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:14,485
Oh great, thanks.

534
00:26:17,388 --> 00:26:21,852
if I can go back to your anecdote in the beginning, the imagine you just quit your job scenario

535
00:26:22,192 --> 00:26:28,437
did you guys spend any time looking for investors to help fund your game in the beginning or was it totally self-funded?

536
00:26:28,457 --> 00:26:29,417
no it was all bootstrapped

537
00:26:29,818 --> 00:26:31,039
okay

538
00:26:31,059 --> 00:26:34,041
we really wanted to make our first game really our game and

539
00:26:34,061 --> 00:26:36,423
if you go to investors you might end up making their game

540
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:37,363
gotcha, thanks

541
00:26:41,851 --> 00:26:43,192
Hi, this was very helpful, thank you.

542
00:26:43,212 --> 00:26:46,655
I hope this isn't a breach, but I'm a composer,

543
00:26:46,735 --> 00:26:48,897
so if anyone is looking for music for their game,

544
00:26:49,337 --> 00:26:51,579
I'm staying in this room for the next talk,

545
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:52,901
so come see me, thanks.

546
00:26:52,921 --> 00:26:58,446
I have a question about getting outreach.

547
00:27:00,187 --> 00:27:02,549
When you say you went out to

548
00:27:04,091 --> 00:27:05,912
things like Rock, Paper, Shotgun, Polygon,

549
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:13,474
Was this all online? You're barraging them with emails, hitting them up on Twitter, or are you meeting them in person?

550
00:27:15,025 --> 00:27:17,426
or maybe all of the above, you know, do everything you can.

551
00:27:17,646 --> 00:27:18,767
Yeah, really all of the above.

552
00:27:19,567 --> 00:27:22,128
When we were making this game, we still lived in San Francisco,

553
00:27:22,588 --> 00:27:25,509
so it was possible for us to talk to some of the press more directly.

554
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,730
But it was a lot of emails, a lot of traditional PR,

555
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,731
where we would do announcements and press releases

556
00:27:30,771 --> 00:27:33,652
that they would then follow up on with us and our consultant.

557
00:27:34,472 --> 00:27:35,172
But yeah, everything.

558
00:27:35,312 --> 00:27:40,174
If you find out a game journalist, just talk about your game,

559
00:27:40,194 --> 00:27:41,134
talk about what they like, too.

560
00:27:41,335 --> 00:27:42,555
So make it a conversation.

561
00:27:42,575 --> 00:27:43,375
All right.

562
00:27:47,423 --> 00:27:50,824
So I noticed this talk was obviously that you did a game in a year.

563
00:27:52,044 --> 00:27:56,565
You're now making your second game. Have you changed that scope to be a larger amount of time

564
00:27:56,585 --> 00:28:00,306
so you can have things like your multiplayer features now that you're not starving artists or

565
00:28:00,827 --> 00:28:03,387
so to speak a little bit better off than you were before?

566
00:28:03,667 --> 00:28:08,049
Definitely. One of the, our second game that we're making is one of the games that we

567
00:28:09,089 --> 00:28:10,929
put aside. Like we don't have time to make that in a year.

568
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:13,510
So that's one of the games we're building next. It's probably going to take about

569
00:28:14,612 --> 00:28:15,492
two years, hopefully.

570
00:28:16,073 --> 00:28:18,015
But we're keeping the same sort of urgency.

571
00:28:18,135 --> 00:28:21,157
It's important to say, we have two years to make this game.

572
00:28:21,398 --> 00:28:24,600
And really, we kind of view it as we're starting over every

573
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,122
time when it comes to our game.

574
00:28:26,182 --> 00:28:28,704
We're not counting on that first game to keep us going.

575
00:28:28,744 --> 00:28:30,125
The second game needs to keep us going now.

576
00:28:30,205 --> 00:28:32,067
So just keep urgent.

577
00:28:34,346 --> 00:28:44,333
Hopefully this isn't too personal, but I'm interested in when you first set out, were you venture-backed, or how did you put food on the table for a year while you were keeping this going? You mentioned savings.

578
00:28:44,473 --> 00:29:01,484
Yeah, I remember that like after years of planning, like this is something that we sort of, I think four or five years ago said that we wanted to do, and it was saving and working and keeping like that long-term goal in view. And that's really why we only had a year, because you can only save so much money.

579
00:29:02,565 --> 00:29:02,745
Thanks.

580
00:29:04,269 --> 00:29:06,251
Okay, I'm getting the... so I can do one more quick.

581
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:12,999
Okay. What kind of work did you contract out and then how did you go about finding those contractors?

582
00:29:13,988 --> 00:29:16,268
It was art and art.

583
00:29:17,629 --> 00:29:19,849
You don't want to see any of the stuff that we draw.

584
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:22,510
And really, it was like our own personal network.

585
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:25,491
Like, the artists that we worked with for the first game

586
00:29:25,531 --> 00:29:28,572
and we're still working with, we found it through, actually,

587
00:29:28,612 --> 00:29:29,112
her Twitter feed.

588
00:29:30,812 --> 00:29:33,173
And we just said, we love your stuff.

589
00:29:33,393 --> 00:29:34,533
Would you be interested in working with us?

590
00:29:34,653 --> 00:29:37,374
And we got lucky, essentially.

591
00:29:38,614 --> 00:29:44,318
and all the other artists was a friend from a from an old job who wasn't looking for work. So yeah, we mind our networks.

592
00:29:46,299 --> 00:29:46,719
Thank you, everybody.
