1
00:00:04,918 --> 00:00:08,261
So first, I just want to throw up the obligatory resume slide

2
00:00:08,901 --> 00:00:10,022
just so you know where I'm coming from

3
00:00:10,062 --> 00:00:10,943
and what I'm talking about.

4
00:00:11,924 --> 00:00:13,245
My career has largely been working

5
00:00:13,365 --> 00:00:15,027
on sort of narrative first-person games,

6
00:00:15,087 --> 00:00:16,968
in which I've been a level designer for about 10 years.

7
00:00:17,509 --> 00:00:18,710
And that's mostly the sort of stuff

8
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:20,131
that I was going to be focusing on.

9
00:00:21,052 --> 00:00:22,033
I'm currently working on something

10
00:00:22,053 --> 00:00:23,074
that's not that at all.

11
00:00:23,274 --> 00:00:24,455
And I'm not really going to be talking

12
00:00:24,475 --> 00:00:25,636
about that very much at all.

13
00:00:26,937 --> 00:00:29,920
So first, I want to talk about what do I mean by expressive.

14
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,401
And I think there's a couple, there's

15
00:00:31,441 --> 00:00:32,942
two components that I wanted to talk about.

16
00:00:34,193 --> 00:00:36,775
One is expressing something about the world or characters,

17
00:00:36,815 --> 00:00:38,316
and it's just the ways that you can use

18
00:00:38,676 --> 00:00:41,578
really simple level design tools to say something,

19
00:00:41,658 --> 00:00:45,081
essentially to act in the world on behalf of the characters

20
00:00:45,141 --> 00:00:47,482
that you are portraying through your scripting.

21
00:00:48,323 --> 00:00:50,644
And then the other is creating opportunities

22
00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:52,806
for player expression, which I just want to look

23
00:00:52,826 --> 00:00:53,986
at a couple examples of.

24
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:58,067
ways that you can use, again, a very simple tool set

25
00:00:58,147 --> 00:01:00,488
to create opportunities where the player can say something

26
00:01:00,528 --> 00:01:03,308
about themselves in the world and the sort of player

27
00:01:03,348 --> 00:01:03,908
they want to be.

28
00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:06,629
And I'm going to be looking at this through the frame

29
00:01:06,849 --> 00:01:08,629
of specifically scripting.

30
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:11,190
One thing, just a warning, it occurred to me

31
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:12,190
while I was sitting up here that I'm

32
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,110
going to be referring to the script, which

33
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:15,571
is like the written document that

34
00:01:15,611 --> 00:01:17,631
defines what happens in the world and the dialogue

35
00:01:17,651 --> 00:01:20,432
and whatnot, and scripting, which

36
00:01:20,532 --> 00:01:22,872
is the actual logic that is driving the game.

37
00:01:24,003 --> 00:01:26,367
So, let me apologize in advance for that,

38
00:01:26,387 --> 00:01:27,708
because I realize it might be confusing.

39
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,112
I'm also really mostly going to be looking at

40
00:01:30,212 --> 00:01:32,134
really simple tools like delays and triggers

41
00:01:32,355 --> 00:01:33,837
and counters, that sort of thing.

42
00:01:33,897 --> 00:01:37,301
Like the really basic building blocks of scripting level.

43
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,881
So I also just wanted to talk a little bit about

44
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:45,404
the level design job, because the stuff that I'm looking at

45
00:01:45,584 --> 00:01:48,386
really pertains to one particular type of level design.

46
00:01:49,066 --> 00:01:51,047
As Joel indicated earlier, level design can mean

47
00:01:51,067 --> 00:01:53,528
a lot of different things, and my job as a level designer

48
00:01:53,588 --> 00:01:54,929
now is very, very different.

49
00:01:55,489 --> 00:01:58,691
So this is really looking at the job of the level designer

50
00:01:58,771 --> 00:02:01,113
on narrative, authored, first-person type games,

51
00:02:01,533 --> 00:02:03,534
which is admittedly a very thin slice

52
00:02:03,754 --> 00:02:04,895
of what level design can be.

53
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:12,147
So in looking at what that job is, I was thinking about what I looked for when I was hiring people

54
00:02:12,547 --> 00:02:16,051
when I was working at Irrational. And there were really two main qualities that I was looking for.

55
00:02:16,611 --> 00:02:21,276
One was the ability to flawlessly execute required content. And what that means is basically you're

56
00:02:21,296 --> 00:02:26,562
given a script by Creative Direction and it's your job to just make that happen in the world

57
00:02:26,662 --> 00:02:29,165
in a way that just feels great from the first time through it.

58
00:02:29,809 --> 00:02:36,211
And also that you can build in a way that is really functional and robust and not, you know,

59
00:02:36,271 --> 00:02:39,713
terrible and won't fall apart the moment somebody sort of misbehaves in a way.

60
00:02:40,433 --> 00:02:44,655
And then the other is the ability to sort of effectively fill in the gaps in that script

61
00:02:44,995 --> 00:02:48,837
with your own creative solutions that are sort of on tone and on theme with what's going on around it.

62
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:55,445
And really the flawless execution part is the part that I think is kind of most important for a level designer.

63
00:02:55,525 --> 00:03:04,349
At least in my own experience, maybe 95 or more percent of my time was spent really just implementing stuff as written and just sort of making things work.

64
00:03:04,749 --> 00:03:11,992
The remaining 5% is sort of the really creative, like, I'm inventing this scene and it's going to be awesome and I'm a great writer and so on and so forth.

65
00:03:12,212 --> 00:03:15,213
But flawless execution is super important because it's mostly what you're doing.

66
00:03:17,185 --> 00:03:19,928
So where I want to start is just looking at a first pass,

67
00:03:19,968 --> 00:03:22,050
sort of the gray box script in a way.

68
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,112
And I want to look at essentially

69
00:03:24,152 --> 00:03:26,314
like a really, really simple kind of sequence, which

70
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,956
is you're given a script.

71
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:31,819
And in it, it's got just a moment and a thing is said,

72
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:32,860
or something occurs.

73
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,502
Like the player enters this room,

74
00:03:34,542 --> 00:03:35,763
and then this VO line plays.

75
00:03:36,642 --> 00:03:38,662
A typical sort of first pass is something like this.

76
00:03:38,862 --> 00:03:41,523
I just sort of showed a version of it.

77
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:43,443
This is all done in Unreal 4, because that's

78
00:03:43,463 --> 00:03:44,283
what I'm working on right now.

79
00:03:45,103 --> 00:03:47,204
It's basically the players touch a trigger,

80
00:03:47,224 --> 00:03:48,864
I check that it's a player, play a sound.

81
00:03:48,924 --> 00:03:49,704
It's really simple.

82
00:03:49,744 --> 00:03:52,045
It gets the point across, but there's not a lot of art there.

83
00:03:53,865 --> 00:03:57,086
So I want to look at just a moment from Infinite.

84
00:03:58,806 --> 00:03:59,046
Hold on.

85
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:00,867
Oh, all right, there it goes.

86
00:04:02,871 --> 00:04:06,013
basically the script. The player sees this body and then they say

87
00:04:06,053 --> 00:04:22,679
something. This is supposed to be audio. Well, that's a bummer.

88
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:26,180
Alright, so basically he walked up to the body, looked for a

89
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,761
moment and said, shit.

90
00:04:28,975 --> 00:04:33,479
So that was the script. It's like a really, really simple moment.

91
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,641
Booker Lighthouse sees body says shit.

92
00:04:37,723 --> 00:04:40,446
So essentially that was like the thing you just looked at.

93
00:04:40,646 --> 00:04:42,468
Trigger is hit. Thing occurs.

94
00:04:43,164 --> 00:04:46,866
But there's something else that's going on in there, and that's the delay, which I think

95
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:52,708
is sort of one of the fundamental little building blocks of building interesting sort of scripts.

96
00:04:53,408 --> 00:04:57,450
And the delay I depict here is like a 0.2 second delay, which is actually for narrative

97
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:00,411
stuff kind of a really good place to start.

98
00:05:00,451 --> 00:05:03,992
Like, it's really small, but it's a way to sort of approximate that moment when somebody

99
00:05:04,032 --> 00:05:10,495
is parsing or a character is taking a moment to gain understanding, because brains don't

100
00:05:10,535 --> 00:05:12,155
to work as fast as, you know,

101
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:14,244
the tick rate of your game as you're playing it.

102
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,767
This is a really powerful tool that is kind of divisive.

103
00:05:18,928 --> 00:05:20,350
In my experience, tech hates them.

104
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,192
Delays add a lot of noise to systems,

105
00:05:23,813 --> 00:05:25,714
in that when it's time to debug, a delay

106
00:05:25,754 --> 00:05:27,195
can create all sorts of weird problems

107
00:05:27,236 --> 00:05:28,356
because this stuff that's supposed

108
00:05:28,377 --> 00:05:30,158
to be executing in this really precise order

109
00:05:30,598 --> 00:05:32,100
that the programmers can anticipate now

110
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:35,122
has a designer kind of screwing things up and arbitrarily just

111
00:05:35,242 --> 00:05:36,143
adding problems.

112
00:05:36,163 --> 00:05:37,384
You can create race conditions.

113
00:05:37,424 --> 00:05:38,505
They become really hard to debug.

114
00:05:39,512 --> 00:05:45,954
Conversely, narrative is going to want you to always use delays because essentially you're trying generally to depict like sort of human interactions

115
00:05:46,514 --> 00:05:50,395
within essentially like a machine of just things that click on and off and

116
00:05:50,596 --> 00:05:56,457
Using little moments and pauses is sort of the tool that the level designer has where they can essentially act in the world

117
00:05:56,497 --> 00:06:00,038
You know where you can insert a pause which is you know a huge part of of

118
00:06:00,218 --> 00:06:03,759
Acting is just like the moments when you don't say something or editing as well

119
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:08,641
You know it's the the moments when things are not occurring and that's what the delay is really good at doing

120
00:06:10,585 --> 00:06:12,266
So they can do all sorts of different things.

121
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:15,987
They can depict sort of a pause between thoughts or a moment

122
00:06:16,007 --> 00:06:16,907
to gain understanding.

123
00:06:17,567 --> 00:06:19,748
They can also be used to sort of set up a joke

124
00:06:20,008 --> 00:06:22,728
or be the moment before a jump scare to build tension.

125
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:28,850
And I want to use an example of that, which actually I

126
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:29,970
think no audio here is OK.

127
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:30,770
This is from Gone Home.

128
00:06:44,656 --> 00:06:46,818
Oh, and then the delay went off at that moment.

129
00:06:47,258 --> 00:06:48,479
The thing I like about that, I think

130
00:06:48,499 --> 00:06:50,781
that's a really artful use of a very, very simple tool, which

131
00:06:50,861 --> 00:06:52,803
is the tool is basically a timer goes off

132
00:06:53,843 --> 00:06:54,904
when the player reads the note.

133
00:06:55,044 --> 00:06:57,406
And then that timer is tuned to be a point

134
00:06:57,526 --> 00:06:59,148
that nobody is reasonably going to be

135
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:00,208
able to read that whole note.

136
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:03,331
And then it sort of forces that note down so the player

137
00:07:03,371 --> 00:07:04,752
can no longer read it.

138
00:07:04,912 --> 00:07:07,294
And then after that, the player can no longer pick it up.

139
00:07:07,721 --> 00:07:11,242
I really like that moment because I think it's a really artful use of a very, very simple tool,

140
00:07:11,362 --> 00:07:15,543
and it also is just an interesting moment because it's one of the only moments I could think of in Gone Home,

141
00:07:16,344 --> 00:07:19,005
and actually really anywhere, like this is not a common thing to do,

142
00:07:19,025 --> 00:07:22,246
where there's a really clear tension established between what the character in the world wants

143
00:07:22,306 --> 00:07:24,466
and what the player wants to do, and they actually fight with each other,

144
00:07:24,646 --> 00:07:28,108
and the character you're inhabiting sort of asserts themselves.

145
00:07:28,688 --> 00:07:32,769
So it's a cool moment, and I think that's a great example of a good way to use this sort of tool.

146
00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:37,770
Another tool I wanted to talk about briefly is the line of sight trigger, which I view

147
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:42,191
as one of the most vital tools for doing first person narrative storytelling.

148
00:07:42,231 --> 00:07:45,692
It's basically just a trigger that fires when the player has line of sight to something.

149
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:48,493
And the functionality for this sort of thing is pretty simple.

150
00:07:48,533 --> 00:07:49,373
I'm just going to outline it.

151
00:07:49,473 --> 00:07:52,874
If you don't have this in your engine and you're making a first person game, put in

152
00:07:52,994 --> 00:07:56,195
a request with tech to make sure that you get this thing because it is super useful.

153
00:07:56,921 --> 00:07:58,543
And it's a very powerful tool.

154
00:07:58,803 --> 00:08:00,584
So you're looking for a few features for it.

155
00:08:01,645 --> 00:08:04,408
One is the active area, like the screen percent.

156
00:08:04,508 --> 00:08:06,190
So basically, you've got this big screen,

157
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:08,612
and you want to make sure that the player has the thing

158
00:08:08,652 --> 00:08:10,073
that you want to know they're looking at

159
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:11,394
in the center of the screen.

160
00:08:11,474 --> 00:08:12,615
Or maybe you want to make sure it's

161
00:08:12,655 --> 00:08:14,717
at the periphery, depending on what sort of event

162
00:08:14,737 --> 00:08:15,438
you're going to fire.

163
00:08:18,781 --> 00:08:19,922
You've got a trigger distance.

164
00:08:22,198 --> 00:08:24,419
which you want to make sure the trigger just doesn't work

165
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,740
over infinite distances, because you're setting up something

166
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,181
you want the player to respond to or acknowledge.

167
00:08:29,201 --> 00:08:33,203
But if they see it through a weird gap in the geometry

168
00:08:33,243 --> 00:08:34,464
or something from a great distance away,

169
00:08:34,504 --> 00:08:36,104
you don't want to need to account for that.

170
00:08:36,124 --> 00:08:37,605
And you don't want to need to build extra logic

171
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:38,766
to turn it on and off.

172
00:08:41,107 --> 00:08:44,408
You need the on begin overlap, like line of sight is gained.

173
00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:46,169
On end overlap, it ends.

174
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,441
the ability to toggle it and then for bonus points you'd

175
00:08:49,461 --> 00:08:51,562
actually probably want to see if you could get built in like a

176
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:55,405
time delay within it so that it will fire an output when you

177
00:08:55,465 --> 00:08:57,966
say like X number of seconds have passed so you know that the

178
00:08:57,986 --> 00:09:01,168
player has been continuously looking at something for some

179
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:04,810
amount of time. And again I'm going to look at another example

180
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:08,052
for this. And actually with no audio you're not going to be

181
00:09:08,072 --> 00:09:16,456
able to hear really what happens. Oh wait. Oh. Oh. Sorry.

182
00:09:17,297 --> 00:09:17,877
Sorry.

183
00:09:20,239 --> 00:09:23,141
All right.

184
00:09:38,773 --> 00:09:39,874
Oh, I think I just broke it.

185
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:42,636
Man, I'm not good at computers, I guess.

186
00:09:48,534 --> 00:09:52,382
Alright, let me see if I can... oh man. Alright. Well... anyway.

187
00:09:52,483 --> 00:09:56,772
There we go.

188
00:09:56,953 --> 00:09:58,216
The seed of the prophet.

189
00:10:03,762 --> 00:10:07,603
So very much like the prior example, the script for that was very simple. The player sees this

190
00:10:07,683 --> 00:10:11,044
sign and then they say something about it. The thing with that sign is positionally it's

191
00:10:11,064 --> 00:10:15,106
like over the player's head. So use a line of sight trigger there to determine that they are

192
00:10:15,146 --> 00:10:19,788
now looking up and actually reading the thing. So then I can fire something appropriately off

193
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:24,509
that. There's also another thing going on in here which is hysteresis. And I'm going to talk

194
00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:26,730
through what this is because it looks like a mess right now.

195
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:32,235
But basically hysteresis is like the dictionary definition is up there, the phenomenon which

196
00:10:32,275 --> 00:10:35,497
the value of a physical property lags behind changes in the effect causing it.

197
00:10:35,878 --> 00:10:39,181
Really what this means is you just trigger events on thresholds as opposed to just sort

198
00:10:39,201 --> 00:10:40,522
of a binary on off switch.

199
00:10:41,062 --> 00:10:46,667
So the script to basically use a line of sight trigger in a way that exhibits hysteresis

200
00:10:46,887 --> 00:10:48,689
is right here you've got on look.

201
00:10:50,731 --> 00:10:55,395
I'm setting B is looking, a Boolean to true, waiting for a delay.

202
00:10:56,141 --> 00:10:58,243
checking if that Boolean is still true,

203
00:10:58,863 --> 00:11:00,905
then this is just a gate that will only ever fire once.

204
00:11:01,145 --> 00:11:03,367
And in this example, just because it's an example I set up,

205
00:11:03,407 --> 00:11:04,307
it's just printing a string.

206
00:11:05,128 --> 00:11:07,650
But the important thing here is the untouch,

207
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,171
like the line of sight lost event,

208
00:11:09,632 --> 00:11:11,173
which you then set this Boolean to false.

209
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:15,977
So what occurs there is, as the delay winds down,

210
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:20,222
if the player has looked away, it won't fire as true.

211
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:21,682
And the reason this sort of thing is important,

212
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:23,022
especially with line of sight triggers,

213
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,703
is players are super erratic.

214
00:11:24,723 --> 00:11:26,323
They're like swinging their crosshairs all around.

215
00:11:26,343 --> 00:11:28,003
They may not actually be looking at a thing.

216
00:11:29,084 --> 00:11:31,004
They could just be like swinging their crosshair around

217
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:31,704
to shoot some fool.

218
00:11:32,444 --> 00:11:34,145
So you wanna just make sure that there's,

219
00:11:35,305 --> 00:11:37,065
like they have lingered on something for a moment.

220
00:11:38,686 --> 00:11:41,927
Another way to use hysteresis is actually

221
00:11:41,947 --> 00:11:42,767
in physical triggers.

222
00:11:43,207 --> 00:11:45,507
This is just a sleep location

223
00:11:45,647 --> 00:11:47,028
from the current game I'm working on.

224
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:50,085
The way you do this is actually use two triggers for events.

225
00:11:50,325 --> 00:11:52,469
One, a small trigger used for on touch,

226
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:56,796
and then a larger trigger used for on untouch.

227
00:11:57,548 --> 00:11:59,429
And there's a couple benefits to this,

228
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:03,892
both technical and more softer experiential.

229
00:12:05,073 --> 00:12:07,295
The kind of softer experiential benefit

230
00:12:07,455 --> 00:12:09,977
is in a level the player is moving through,

231
00:12:09,997 --> 00:12:12,178
they're basically just operating on and off switches

232
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:13,479
on a bunch of logic.

233
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:17,042
And when you on off something on a single switch,

234
00:12:17,062 --> 00:12:19,463
it could feel very binary, because it is.

235
00:12:20,752 --> 00:12:30,703
And it can have sort of githering problems where if somebody is going back and forth over a switch, it can become really obvious that, oh, this light is somehow tied to where I'm standing on the floor, and that's really weird.

236
00:12:32,044 --> 00:12:39,972
So it's just like sort of a good general way to sort of make something turn off at one point and on at one point and off at another in a way that doesn't feel super mechanical.

237
00:12:40,933 --> 00:12:42,975
But it's also really good just in terms of

238
00:12:43,515 --> 00:12:44,816
like a best practice technically.

239
00:12:45,737 --> 00:12:47,559
Because a lot of times you might be doing something

240
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:49,940
with a trigger that takes longer than a single frame

241
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,602
or a tick to execute.

242
00:12:52,042 --> 00:12:55,665
So an example might be, say you've got an AI encounter

243
00:12:55,905 --> 00:12:57,567
and you want to spawn a bunch of AIs in it.

244
00:12:58,347 --> 00:13:00,249
The first thing you might do is just wrap the whole thing

245
00:13:00,289 --> 00:13:02,430
in a big trigger and on approach,

246
00:13:02,771 --> 00:13:04,592
you spawn all the AIs like on touch

247
00:13:05,173 --> 00:13:06,634
and on untouch you unspawn them.

248
00:13:07,206 --> 00:13:09,848
The issues from that can come about because spawning an AI

249
00:13:09,888 --> 00:13:13,952
typically takes longer than it takes to just zip back and forth

250
00:13:13,992 --> 00:13:16,634
over a trigger. Then you can find yourself in a situation

251
00:13:16,694 --> 00:13:22,159
where basically you've untouched the trigger while the AIs are

252
00:13:22,179 --> 00:13:25,121
still spawning. Maybe that untouch is doing something like

253
00:13:25,161 --> 00:13:27,643
deactivating the logic that controls the AIs so now they're

254
00:13:27,663 --> 00:13:30,225
spawning but there's nothing to control them. Maybe at that

255
00:13:30,265 --> 00:13:32,647
point you find yourself with a bunch of rogue AIs with like

256
00:13:32,748 --> 00:13:33,668
nothing managing them.

257
00:13:34,273 --> 00:13:36,854
And maybe at that point you find yourself in a situation

258
00:13:36,894 --> 00:13:39,474
where QA figures out a method whereby they can do that

259
00:13:39,514 --> 00:13:40,795
with every trigger in the game,

260
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,355
and maybe at that point you cancel your vacation plans

261
00:13:43,415 --> 00:13:44,876
to rewrite all the triggers.

262
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:46,456
So you don't wanna do that.

263
00:13:46,856 --> 00:13:48,637
You just build your triggers in this way.

264
00:13:48,677 --> 00:13:50,157
You're saving yourself a lot of grief.

265
00:13:51,238 --> 00:13:54,839
So, Hysteresis I think is a good overall tool,

266
00:13:55,439 --> 00:13:57,779
in that it allows you to do things like wait for a moment,

267
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,280
confirm engagement,

268
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,341
let the player think, let the character think.

269
00:14:03,751 --> 00:14:06,352
and also avoid sort of mechanical issues like dithering

270
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:10,673
and really obvious mechanical bugs and low repro bugs

271
00:14:10,713 --> 00:14:11,694
that are hard to track down.

272
00:14:13,835 --> 00:14:15,035
I want to look at another example,

273
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:16,736
which is where you start to sort of

274
00:14:16,776 --> 00:14:17,776
build these things together.

275
00:14:18,156 --> 00:14:20,077
This is the honor store from the beginning

276
00:14:20,177 --> 00:14:21,337
of Bioshock Infinite.

277
00:14:22,178 --> 00:14:24,539
And this is, again, just using some very simple tools,

278
00:14:24,579 --> 00:14:26,579
but it's trying to build an actual interactive sequence

279
00:14:26,619 --> 00:14:29,080
in which the player can express something about themselves.

280
00:14:32,521 --> 00:14:32,742
Whoops.

281
00:14:36,269 --> 00:14:38,290
but a bit weak in the key of the scroll.

282
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:43,132
Cloudy skies, warm temperatures, and light variable winds

283
00:14:43,172 --> 00:14:44,173
throughout the afternoon.

284
00:14:44,193 --> 00:14:48,615
In short, a beautiful day for the festivities, Columbia.

285
00:14:49,696 --> 00:14:51,917
And now, back to the music.

286
00:14:52,477 --> 00:14:54,318
We've seen it coming down the street.

287
00:14:54,858 --> 00:14:59,981
Now I ask you very confidently, take me, please.

288
00:15:00,061 --> 00:15:01,421
Take me tonight.

289
00:15:01,441 --> 00:15:01,581
Oh.

290
00:15:03,742 --> 00:15:05,563
So what I like about that moment is really.

291
00:15:06,549 --> 00:15:07,869
It's very early on in the game.

292
00:15:07,909 --> 00:15:10,050
It's before all the sort of core verbs have opened up.

293
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,150
The player doesn't have a gun yet.

294
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:13,591
They're sort of in the walk around

295
00:15:13,651 --> 00:15:14,591
and experience the world.

296
00:15:14,651 --> 00:15:16,091
It's like the introduction, but there's not

297
00:15:16,111 --> 00:15:17,632
a lot of sort of interactive options.

298
00:15:18,472 --> 00:15:21,013
But what it creates is an opportunity for the player

299
00:15:21,093 --> 00:15:23,053
to interact with something in the world

300
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:25,214
and do something that, in a non-consequential way,

301
00:15:25,254 --> 00:15:27,014
allows them to express something about themselves

302
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:29,935
and what the sort of player they are and what they want to be.

303
00:15:30,395 --> 00:15:31,555
And this is all optional, too.

304
00:15:31,595 --> 00:15:33,116
There's no reason you need to go in there.

305
00:15:34,015 --> 00:15:35,856
But if you do, you can decide, like, am I a crook,

306
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:37,657
or am I an honest person?

307
00:15:37,677 --> 00:15:38,717
And it's really simple.

308
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:41,098
Like, it's a fun thing to do that

309
00:15:41,138 --> 00:15:43,279
lets people just sort of touch and interact

310
00:15:43,299 --> 00:15:44,260
with the world a little bit.

311
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,541
And the construction of this is actually very simple.

312
00:15:49,422 --> 00:15:51,403
Basically, there's a look trigger inside the door

313
00:15:51,603 --> 00:15:54,864
on approach, which causes the animation of the existing

314
00:15:54,904 --> 00:15:56,945
customer to play, where he flips the coin in.

315
00:15:57,085 --> 00:15:59,126
And there's also just a touch trigger as a fallback.

316
00:15:59,186 --> 00:16:01,027
If the player happens to back into the store,

317
00:16:01,047 --> 00:16:02,988
they're not going to see an idle, dumb AI not

318
00:16:03,008 --> 00:16:03,508
doing anything.

319
00:16:05,011 --> 00:16:06,372
Then on trigger, play the item.

320
00:16:07,693 --> 00:16:08,894
There's a variable in the store,

321
00:16:09,514 --> 00:16:11,375
and this is like the core unit of logic

322
00:16:11,435 --> 00:16:13,557
for this whole encounter, or this whole sequence,

323
00:16:13,677 --> 00:16:16,538
is itotal unpaid items, or something like that,

324
00:16:17,359 --> 00:16:19,520
which I just sort of count up as the player takes items,

325
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,261
and I decrement to zero when they pay.

326
00:16:21,902 --> 00:16:24,243
There's a usable actor that sits on the little money bin.

327
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:27,826
And then every time they collect something,

328
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:30,207
I increment that itotal unpaid items by one.

329
00:16:30,935 --> 00:16:33,738
and as they approach the payment box, I check it like,

330
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,299
just generally I try and do this check

331
00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:37,462
at the last possible moment where something is set.

332
00:16:37,602 --> 00:16:39,043
So when they get really close to the box,

333
00:16:39,103 --> 00:16:42,006
I check if they have more than zero unpaid items,

334
00:16:42,487 --> 00:16:45,370
at which point I activate the pay money entity.

335
00:16:46,211 --> 00:16:48,793
And the other things, like the coins themselves,

336
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,795
are just overridden by the pay money.

337
00:16:52,122 --> 00:17:00,189
You can, if you actually do kind of aim in, I'm not super fond of this, you can like really zero in and get the coins so you can steal when you still have money to pay.

338
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:08,316
But it's really simple tools, like it's basically a look trigger, an integer counter, item used events, and a usable actor.

339
00:17:11,299 --> 00:17:16,283
And I think one of the strengths of what the level designer can do is do a lot with like...

340
00:17:17,533 --> 00:17:18,973
very little unique content.

341
00:17:19,033 --> 00:17:20,974
Like this, the honor store went in very late,

342
00:17:21,074 --> 00:17:22,334
and it's sort of an example of,

343
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:24,115
we called it like making soup,

344
00:17:24,215 --> 00:17:25,775
where basically you've got this whole cupboard

345
00:17:25,815 --> 00:17:28,456
full of things you can use, animations, art,

346
00:17:28,996 --> 00:17:30,857
and you just sort of can assemble them in different ways,

347
00:17:30,937 --> 00:17:33,058
and I think that that's like an opportunity for designers,

348
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:34,918
particularly late in a project

349
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:36,039
when there's not a lot of time,

350
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:37,699
and there's certainly not a lot of engineering time

351
00:17:37,739 --> 00:17:39,140
to create interactive sequences.

352
00:17:40,213 --> 00:17:42,595
So this sequence really needed a custom sign,

353
00:17:43,055 --> 00:17:45,416
so one art asset, some repurposed animation,

354
00:17:45,437 --> 00:17:47,438
I believe that actually started as a grenade toss

355
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,600
when the guy flips the coin in, which worked okay,

356
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,802
and actually wasn't a lot of work

357
00:17:52,842 --> 00:17:54,002
to repurpose it into a coin flip.

358
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,724
There was a couple of small pickup dialogue lines

359
00:17:56,764 --> 00:17:58,185
and a few text lines to localize,

360
00:17:58,225 --> 00:18:00,487
which is one of the cheapest changes you can make

361
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:03,469
or ads you can do very late in a game's development process.

362
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,221
Another example I wanted to look at that was kind of an

363
00:18:08,261 --> 00:18:10,522
inspiration actually for the honor story is pick up the can

364
00:18:11,062 --> 00:18:13,202
which I find to be a really unique and memorable moment.

365
00:18:13,783 --> 00:18:16,304
And I'm guessing maybe some of you know what I'm talking

366
00:18:16,324 --> 00:18:17,744
about without even mentioning the game.

367
00:18:29,388 --> 00:18:31,008
Thank you for a ride.

368
00:18:32,012 --> 00:18:36,235
Of course, your question touches on one of the basic biological impulses,

369
00:18:36,395 --> 00:18:40,899
with all its associated hopes and fears for the future of the species.

370
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:46,184
Of course, your question touches on one of the basic biological impulses,

371
00:18:46,244 --> 00:18:52,449
with all its associated hopes and fears for the future of the species.

372
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:56,033
I also detect some unspecified questions.

373
00:18:58,861 --> 00:19:02,065
I love that moment just because, like, similar to the Honor System store, it's very early

374
00:19:02,085 --> 00:19:02,486
in the game.

375
00:19:02,506 --> 00:19:05,430
It's before you've got a lot of core verbs available to you, but it gives the player

376
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:09,455
a really fun opportunity to just kind of say something about who they are, decide how they

377
00:19:09,475 --> 00:19:10,356
want to inhabit the world.

378
00:19:10,396 --> 00:19:11,998
Like, they have an option there to essentially...

379
00:19:12,465 --> 00:19:14,287
kind of, you know, not make trouble, heads down,

380
00:19:14,327 --> 00:19:16,649
do what the bad guy says, or they also have the option

381
00:19:16,709 --> 00:19:19,571
to cause trouble, and the whole thing is really

382
00:19:19,611 --> 00:19:22,333
like zero consequence, there's nothing afterwards

383
00:19:22,433 --> 00:19:24,935
that really carries along from that scene,

384
00:19:25,035 --> 00:19:26,916
and the guy's not gonna kill you or anything,

385
00:19:27,897 --> 00:19:29,238
but I do find it's like a really,

386
00:19:30,399 --> 00:19:31,720
it's a cool opportunity and a cool way

387
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,421
to sort of let the player express something

388
00:19:33,522 --> 00:19:35,743
outside the core verbs that says something

389
00:19:35,763 --> 00:19:36,964
about the sort of player they wanna be.

390
00:19:37,825 --> 00:19:40,187
The setup for this, I just opened it up in Hammer

391
00:19:40,207 --> 00:19:40,727
and checked it out.

392
00:19:41,204 --> 00:19:43,485
pretty, I mean it's not, I don't want to trivialize like, I'm

393
00:19:43,525 --> 00:19:45,167
sure there was a lot of work that went into this and there

394
00:19:45,187 --> 00:19:48,549
was definitely some long days of bug fixing associated with it

395
00:19:48,569 --> 00:19:50,971
because it's kind of complicated. But it really comes

396
00:19:51,011 --> 00:19:53,513
down to the use of a couple touch triggers. One on approach

397
00:19:53,553 --> 00:19:56,055
causes the guy to walk out, as you get closer it causes him to

398
00:19:56,155 --> 00:19:56,956
knock the can over.

399
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,123
There's delays that fire off once he does that, where he grows impatient with you and

400
00:20:02,163 --> 00:20:04,985
plays different animations and lines as he grows impatient.

401
00:20:05,806 --> 00:20:10,090
Just a little physics impulse, which I love, like the can flies off the thing because there's

402
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:12,152
a tiny invisible explosion that happens behind it.

403
00:20:12,932 --> 00:20:17,056
And lastly, there's like a collision trigger inside the can that's just waiting to be touched

404
00:20:17,136 --> 00:20:19,438
by the other can, or inside the trash can.

405
00:20:21,835 --> 00:20:24,237
So I encourage designers to do is find opportunities.

406
00:20:24,297 --> 00:20:26,698
Like look for ways you can use the tools at your disposal

407
00:20:26,738 --> 00:20:28,719
to create these sorts of memorable experiences.

408
00:20:28,959 --> 00:20:32,962
And focus on ones outside maybe the core verbs of the game

409
00:20:33,002 --> 00:20:33,322
itself.

410
00:20:33,802 --> 00:20:35,823
Like building gameplay systems and level script

411
00:20:35,863 --> 00:20:37,344
is generally a bad idea, and you're

412
00:20:37,364 --> 00:20:38,785
going to create a world of pain for yourself.

413
00:20:40,126 --> 00:20:42,547
But creating these little one-offs or low consequence

414
00:20:42,627 --> 00:20:44,008
kind of opportunities for the player

415
00:20:44,108 --> 00:20:45,609
is a pretty safe and interesting way

416
00:20:45,649 --> 00:20:46,890
that you can add flavor to your world.

417
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:52,256
The last thing, I think I'm really low on time so I'm going to rush through this, is

418
00:20:52,316 --> 00:20:53,377
missions and quests.

419
00:20:53,697 --> 00:20:57,941
This is actually I think one of the most challenging things as a level designer is generally in

420
00:20:57,981 --> 00:21:01,483
shooters or action games, like every mission, every quest, everything you need to do comes

421
00:21:01,543 --> 00:21:06,907
down to some really simple kind of dumb things like push the button, get the thing to place,

422
00:21:07,048 --> 00:21:08,949
kill the guy or wait for the timer.

423
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,911
So a challenge is sort of how do you make these things interesting.

424
00:21:12,672 --> 00:21:15,794
And I'm going to actually give this in the form of a homework assignment for you all,

425
00:21:15,994 --> 00:21:17,315
but it's to play a video game so it's cool.

426
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:22,224
And I would look at the Overseer Campbell mission from Dishonored.

427
00:21:22,264 --> 00:21:26,788
It's like from the first main mission in the game, like sort of the first proper mission.

428
00:21:27,347 --> 00:21:29,708
And the goals are two from the previous list.

429
00:21:29,869 --> 00:21:31,749
One, you need to get the thing, which is get his journal.

430
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:34,511
And two, eliminate him, which is what I like there

431
00:21:34,531 --> 00:21:36,512
is it's not kill him, it's eliminate.

432
00:21:37,072 --> 00:21:39,033
And the success conditions, if you play through the level,

433
00:21:39,073 --> 00:21:42,115
are really like those two things have occurred.

434
00:21:42,195 --> 00:21:43,555
And I'm pretty sure the way that works is

435
00:21:44,016 --> 00:21:45,556
it's really just two booleans that get flipped.

436
00:21:45,817 --> 00:21:47,157
One, when you grab the journal,

437
00:21:47,177 --> 00:21:48,558
which is a systemic thing you can do

438
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:50,559
when you pickpocket it from him or take it from his body.

439
00:21:51,187 --> 00:21:53,568
and two, has been eliminated, which I believe is probably

440
00:21:53,628 --> 00:21:56,630
fired by either one, any number of ways you can systemically

441
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:59,731
kill him, two, a timer that goes off after he drinks the poison,

442
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:02,172
however he drinks the poison. There's a lot of ways that that

443
00:22:02,212 --> 00:22:05,034
can happen. Or three, has been hooked up to a torture machine,

444
00:22:05,094 --> 00:22:08,835
which is like the, or a branding machine. I am at zero. Oh, man.

445
00:22:09,155 --> 00:22:13,878
All right. Sorry. So the homework assignment is to just

446
00:22:13,938 --> 00:22:16,679
go through this and try all these different things and think

447
00:22:16,719 --> 00:22:19,000
about how it was actually implemented and how it was built.

448
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:25,957
And a lot of it's pretty simple little pieces that together form a really big whole.

449
00:22:27,118 --> 00:22:31,962
So lastly, I would just call the level designers to use your tools, things like Hysteresis,

450
00:22:31,982 --> 00:22:35,585
to try and make interactions that feel human and don't feel like it's just a computer switching

451
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:36,065
off and on.

452
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:40,829
And also to try and inhabit the characters you're portraying and the players you're creating

453
00:22:40,869 --> 00:22:41,009
for.

454
00:22:41,089 --> 00:22:41,710
So think about like...

455
00:22:42,605 --> 00:22:44,747
when somebody is, when you have a line to deliver,

456
00:22:44,787 --> 00:22:46,288
would there be a pause or something like that?

457
00:22:47,089 --> 00:22:48,110
And, sorry, that's it.

458
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:50,151
If you have questions or want to chat,

459
00:22:50,271 --> 00:22:52,173
I'm showing off my game on the show floor at Epic's booth,

460
00:22:52,753 --> 00:22:53,914
and we'll be there all week.

461
00:22:54,455 --> 00:22:54,975
So, thank you.
