1
00:00:06,946 --> 00:00:08,887
Okay.

2
00:00:09,107 --> 00:00:12,008
Learning from our mistakes, a post-mortem of Guacamelee.

3
00:00:12,488 --> 00:00:13,289
That's my talk.

4
00:00:14,949 --> 00:00:15,649
I'm Chris Harvey.

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:17,910
I'm one of the co-founders of Drinkbox.

6
00:00:19,051 --> 00:00:19,771
What does that mean?

7
00:00:21,392 --> 00:00:24,393
It means that I own a chunk of the company.

8
00:00:24,753 --> 00:00:28,415
I do—I lead the technical development on the team, but—

9
00:00:29,275 --> 00:00:33,079
like sort of in fancy terms, you might call me also an executive producer. Like,

10
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:37,243
I'm involved in all the business decisions, I'm constantly reviewing

11
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:40,346
what's happening with the development of the projects. I handle lots of little

12
00:00:40,366 --> 00:00:41,668
things, because we're a small company.

13
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:45,191
So why am I doing this talk?

14
00:00:47,021 --> 00:00:48,902
Making games is not so easy.

15
00:00:50,403 --> 00:00:51,925
We've made a few. We've made three games.

16
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:56,188
And our first game was, hmm, it was okay.

17
00:00:56,628 --> 00:00:57,749
Not, not great.

18
00:00:58,669 --> 00:01:00,191
Our most recent game was much better.

19
00:01:01,191 --> 00:01:01,331
And

20
00:01:02,256 --> 00:01:05,519
You know, because I, because I helped run the company,

21
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:07,900
it's really interesting and important to me

22
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:10,763
to try to understand how you make your team better,

23
00:01:11,283 --> 00:01:14,546
your product better, the environment better, and so on.

24
00:01:14,746 --> 00:01:19,429
And so I thought that I would try to present to people here

25
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:21,271
some information about how we think

26
00:01:21,611 --> 00:01:23,152
that we managed to make our games better.

27
00:01:24,774 --> 00:01:26,195
In particular, I'm going to talk about

28
00:01:26,215 --> 00:01:28,196
the important changes we made.

29
00:01:29,066 --> 00:01:31,527
where we think we made between our first game,

30
00:01:31,607 --> 00:01:34,809
About a Blob, and our most recent title, Guacamelee!

31
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:37,891
So, in case you're not familiar with Guacamelee! at all,

32
00:01:38,051 --> 00:01:41,653
I'm just gonna show a brief trailer for the game.

33
00:01:49,597 --> 00:01:50,617
Sorry about doing it this way,

34
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:53,859
PowerPoint does not play the movies fast enough.

35
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:23,042
Okay. So just to give an overview of what I'm going to do here.

36
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:29,728
Sorry, this slideshow is fighting me.

37
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:35,313
I'm going to talk about how we changed our concept process,

38
00:03:36,494 --> 00:03:38,215
changes we made to our development process,

39
00:03:38,295 --> 00:03:40,377
how we modified our marketing process,

40
00:03:40,437 --> 00:03:43,860
and then some conclusions, some platitudes,

41
00:03:44,481 --> 00:03:47,063
hopefully something sort of useful in the conclusions.

42
00:04:03,665 --> 00:04:04,506
Sorry, technical problem.

43
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:07,287
All right, into the concept stuff.

44
00:04:07,567 --> 00:04:09,408
So I'm just going to give a bit of background on our first

45
00:04:09,448 --> 00:04:12,369
game so you can understand sort of how we built it and

46
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:14,830
some intro on why things kind of went wrong.

47
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,451
And then I'm going to talk about how we, from that

48
00:04:17,511 --> 00:04:20,032
project, how we just completely changed or adjusted

49
00:04:20,072 --> 00:04:22,673
our process in terms of choosing a concept, in terms

50
00:04:22,713 --> 00:04:25,574
of defining the game that we were making, and how we

51
00:04:25,594 --> 00:04:27,155
approached making the game fun.

52
00:04:29,494 --> 00:04:34,316
The founding members of the studio had worked previously on retail console games.

53
00:04:35,797 --> 00:04:38,279
Most of us had either lead roles or senior roles,

54
00:04:38,719 --> 00:04:40,880
but we had no business or production experience.

55
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,722
And that retail experience gave us some advantages,

56
00:04:45,002 --> 00:04:48,284
like we had some idea how to get a game onto a console,

57
00:04:48,364 --> 00:04:51,526
we understood what it meant to finish something and polish it.

58
00:04:52,206 --> 00:04:56,010
But it also gave us a bunch of disadvantages that I think

59
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:59,333
indie developers who haven't worked in retail actually have, which is that

60
00:04:59,673 --> 00:05:02,035
we, coming from a retail perspective, we were

61
00:05:02,516 --> 00:05:04,798
had this thing in our brains about trying to compete

62
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:07,240
largely on scope and production value.

63
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:12,471
Because we bootstrap the company at the beginning using contracts,

64
00:05:13,451 --> 00:05:16,512
it took a long time for the first game to get completed,

65
00:05:16,652 --> 00:05:18,132
and our attention was not focused.

66
00:05:18,772 --> 00:05:20,553
Basically, the main founders,

67
00:05:21,373 --> 00:05:23,253
the three initial founders were all programmers,

68
00:05:23,313 --> 00:05:25,994
and that meant that we could make money doing contracts on other games.

69
00:05:26,754 --> 00:05:29,835
So we would take that money, and then we would pay people internally with salaries

70
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:30,935
out of that money.

71
00:05:31,355 --> 00:05:33,355
But it meant that we were constantly on other projects,

72
00:05:34,135 --> 00:05:36,336
and our focus was spread.

73
00:05:37,393 --> 00:05:39,155
About a blob was not a success.

74
00:05:39,855 --> 00:05:43,358
Although not exactly a failure, we basically broke even on the project.

75
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:47,361
And it was near the end of that project before we had finished it,

76
00:05:48,142 --> 00:05:51,625
but at a point where we knew that it wasn't fundamentally going to change,

77
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,226
that we started concepting our next game.

78
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:55,608
So just to let you...

79
00:05:56,809 --> 00:05:59,851
You definitely may not be familiar with this game, so I'll...

80
00:06:00,452 --> 00:06:02,934
I'll just play the launch trailer for About a Blob as well.

81
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:50,627
Okay, so I'm going to phrase most of the slides in this sort of problem, and then change construct.

82
00:07:51,287 --> 00:07:54,028
So, first problem with the concept of a vote of Bob.

83
00:07:56,809 --> 00:08:00,811
So, the team decided on this concept in consensus.

84
00:08:01,191 --> 00:08:03,712
Nobody sort of objected to it. We all agreed on it.

85
00:08:04,514 --> 00:08:08,357
uh... coming from retail games we were pretty tired of hyper aggressive

86
00:08:08,637 --> 00:08:11,199
games with a lot of gray or brown textures

87
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,623
and so going in this completely different direction felt very fresh for

88
00:08:15,723 --> 00:08:15,823
us

89
00:08:15,843 --> 00:08:18,905
uh... the visual style said family-friendly

90
00:08:19,906 --> 00:08:21,567
the gameplay was puzzly

91
00:08:22,248 --> 00:08:23,129
there was no punching

92
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,832
not really any guns, there were zero zombies

93
00:08:28,013 --> 00:08:29,774
and releasing the game on download PSN

94
00:08:30,395 --> 00:08:32,676
is probably not the best place for a game like that

95
00:08:33,797 --> 00:08:36,398
Like I said, the game was chosen by consensus,

96
00:08:36,999 --> 00:08:39,360
but maybe not with full consideration

97
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,161
for the platforms that we intended to put it out on.

98
00:08:43,602 --> 00:08:46,323
So, the key change that we made

99
00:08:46,603 --> 00:08:47,783
as we were starting Guacamelee!

100
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:49,964
First, we sat everybody down

101
00:08:50,525 --> 00:08:51,785
day after day after day

102
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:53,606
in this basement room in the building.

103
00:08:54,646 --> 00:08:56,407
And we discussed a lot of things.

104
00:08:56,427 --> 00:08:58,168
We talked about what we thought would fit the studio,

105
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:00,649
what people on the team were excited about making,

106
00:09:01,129 --> 00:09:02,050
the goals of the studio.

107
00:09:03,239 --> 00:09:04,599
uh... we did kind of a pre-release

108
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:07,300
post-mortem of about a blob as it was

109
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,821
uh... people just threw it out

110
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:13,722
it was just a broad brainstorming session as well like people throw ideas

111
00:09:13,742 --> 00:09:15,203
for game mechanics and setting

112
00:09:15,843 --> 00:09:18,824
we had all the different disciplines in the room to try to get their perspective

113
00:09:19,144 --> 00:09:19,284
on

114
00:09:20,285 --> 00:09:23,566
on how each discipline thought we should adjust the studio's trajectory

115
00:09:24,425 --> 00:09:27,267
And so after spending a lot of time doing this,

116
00:09:28,087 --> 00:09:30,528
we asked everybody to create single-page pitch sheets

117
00:09:31,629 --> 00:09:32,329
for us to look at.

118
00:09:32,409 --> 00:09:34,470
I'm gonna show the Guacamelee one of these.

119
00:09:36,131 --> 00:09:37,491
Each person was asked to come in with...

120
00:09:38,685 --> 00:09:40,426
at least one pitch for a game.

121
00:09:41,566 --> 00:09:44,628
The pitches had to state a genre, a platform, a target market.

122
00:09:45,308 --> 00:09:48,910
And the concept that followed that had to actually make sense with those things.

123
00:09:49,491 --> 00:09:51,051
There was this kind of gut check.

124
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:53,853
Every time we would look at the thing, we would read it,

125
00:09:54,233 --> 00:09:56,314
and then we would look at the parameters,

126
00:09:56,374 --> 00:09:59,316
and we would say, this makes sense, or this is inconsistent.

127
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:03,922
And the result was a kernel for several different game concepts.

128
00:10:04,322 --> 00:10:06,684
So if you can actually read the stuff there,

129
00:10:06,724 --> 00:10:08,745
what you'll see is that this version of Guacamelee

130
00:10:08,805 --> 00:10:11,207
is supposed to be more of a traditional brawler,

131
00:10:11,467 --> 00:10:12,988
you know, in sort of the isometric mode,

132
00:10:13,188 --> 00:10:14,589
kind of like Castle Crashers.

133
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:16,870
But there were a bunch of other game concepts.

134
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:19,411
So the dimension swapping that's in the game

135
00:10:19,471 --> 00:10:20,931
was for a different kind of game.

136
00:10:20,951 --> 00:10:25,873
The concept of using combat moves for platforming

137
00:10:25,933 --> 00:10:28,013
was just a mechanic that somebody else had suggested.

138
00:10:28,673 --> 00:10:32,654
And so this concept, which everybody was really interested in right away,

139
00:10:32,814 --> 00:10:35,475
partly because of the tone and the character and the art, and...

140
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,917
and the fact that it fit more of a hardcore vibe,

141
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:44,743
the whole group kind of refined the concept over time

142
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:46,904
with ideas from other pitches.

143
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:53,270
So we had a concept, actually we had a couple of concepts,

144
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,371
but this is the one that ended up surviving longest.

145
00:10:56,751 --> 00:10:57,692
We had a concept.

146
00:10:58,692 --> 00:11:00,212
In About a Blob, once we had the concept,

147
00:11:00,272 --> 00:11:03,333
we really struggled to define what the game was.

148
00:11:04,713 --> 00:11:06,594
The initial concept was, okay,

149
00:11:06,634 --> 00:11:08,915
you're a giant blobby monster that gets bigger

150
00:11:09,455 --> 00:11:11,495
as you eat things and you're gonna basically eat the earth.

151
00:11:12,015 --> 00:11:13,556
That's sort of the high-level concept.

152
00:11:14,196 --> 00:11:16,537
But when it came to the details of the universe

153
00:11:16,577 --> 00:11:17,897
and the tone and the gameplay,

154
00:11:19,052 --> 00:11:21,814
we had an extremely difficult time coming to a clear vision.

155
00:11:22,535 --> 00:11:23,736
Was it a B-monster movie?

156
00:11:24,336 --> 00:11:25,818
Or was it a Saturday morning cartoon?

157
00:11:25,858 --> 00:11:27,619
It kind of evolved between one and the other.

158
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:28,780
Was it a puzzle game?

159
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,201
Or was it an action game?

160
00:11:30,562 --> 00:11:31,763
Or was it an exploration game?

161
00:11:31,863 --> 00:11:33,604
That wasn't really in the initial pitch.

162
00:11:35,266 --> 00:11:36,527
Was it hardcore or casual?

163
00:11:37,247 --> 00:11:38,368
Not exactly defined.

164
00:11:38,909 --> 00:11:40,390
So in terms of identity,

165
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:43,493
the game in the end kind of straddled all of these things.

166
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:47,376
And as a result, it was extremely non-committal.

167
00:11:48,691 --> 00:11:50,453
It didn't really go far enough in any direction.

168
00:11:52,074 --> 00:11:53,935
With this in mind, when we started working on,

169
00:11:54,535 --> 00:11:56,437
once we had the initial concept for Guacamelee

170
00:11:56,457 --> 00:11:57,918
and we started trying to flesh it out a bit,

171
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,420
the goal in everyone's mind was

172
00:12:01,661 --> 00:12:04,322
we have to focus the game immediately on what's important.

173
00:12:04,923 --> 00:12:07,124
Any loose threads or things that were vague

174
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:09,866
about the universe of the gameplay were a major red flag

175
00:12:09,906 --> 00:12:12,528
that everybody had to get stressed about right away.

176
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:16,811
Defining those things took a long time.

177
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:20,797
The pre-production for the game was 8 months.

178
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:24,079
The whole development cycle was 19 months,

179
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,442
although it kind of took longer in real time because there was another game that got shipped in the middle there.

180
00:12:28,902 --> 00:12:33,864
But it was 19 months, so almost half the time was spent in pre-production trying to nail down the basics.

181
00:12:34,965 --> 00:12:38,107
And we iterated on everything, on the visual style, on the gameplay, on the tone.

182
00:12:38,867 --> 00:12:41,188
So I'm just going to show a bit of that evolution.

183
00:12:43,288 --> 00:12:46,932
So on the left side is the first sort of sell sheet that we made for the game.

184
00:12:47,513 --> 00:12:49,395
And as you can see, it's very kid-friendly.

185
00:12:50,096 --> 00:12:52,739
It's very much in the blob style.

186
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:58,726
And I remember looking at this sheet once it was kind of in semi-complete form

187
00:12:58,866 --> 00:13:00,869
and looking at one of the other printers and going, what is going on?

188
00:13:01,789 --> 00:13:07,733
because the sheet was made by the artists who themselves were pushing for a more aggressive look to the game,

189
00:13:07,773 --> 00:13:13,057
yet somehow, through habit, it came back to this soft, kid-friendly approach.

190
00:13:13,818 --> 00:13:18,201
And I guess it just kind of reflects the difficulty or the effort that's required

191
00:13:18,221 --> 00:13:21,863
in order to make sure that everybody is focused on what we're actually trying to accomplish.

192
00:13:23,597 --> 00:13:25,538
On the right is the second thing we made.

193
00:13:25,558 --> 00:13:27,660
It was like a three-page description of the game.

194
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,241
And it was definitely in a different direction,

195
00:13:30,301 --> 00:13:32,063
away from Kitty, although maybe not actually

196
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:33,063
a producible style.

197
00:13:34,504 --> 00:13:37,086
Here's some sort of screenshots as they progressed.

198
00:13:37,206 --> 00:13:39,007
On the top left, that's a mock-up.

199
00:13:40,348 --> 00:13:41,089
It's closer.

200
00:13:41,149 --> 00:13:41,989
It's more aggressive.

201
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,451
It feels kind of Mexican, but then it's

202
00:13:44,471 --> 00:13:47,193
sort of full of ghosts and ghouls, which doesn't feel,

203
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:50,475
wasn't in the thrust of what we were trying to accomplish.

204
00:13:50,555 --> 00:13:52,336
We wanted something that felt authentic.

205
00:13:52,987 --> 00:13:57,750
and different, you know, and Ghosts and Ghouls felt predictable.

206
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:01,092
Uh, the top right is our vertical slice,

207
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:04,094
which is cleaner, more than the style we were hoping for,

208
00:14:04,154 --> 00:14:06,836
but it's not exciting, it doesn't really pop yet.

209
00:14:06,856 --> 00:14:11,339
Uh, bottom left, that was the first publicly playable demo,

210
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:13,160
and pretty close to the final look,

211
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,701
and then bottom right, that's the final look.

212
00:14:16,309 --> 00:14:18,390
So I guess you could say it was just a constant iterate.

213
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:19,971
I mean, I'm choosing the visual ones

214
00:14:20,011 --> 00:14:21,852
because those are the easiest to express.

215
00:14:22,753 --> 00:14:24,094
But this was sort of true of everything.

216
00:14:24,134 --> 00:14:26,335
There's this constant, like, this is the wrong direction.

217
00:14:27,316 --> 00:14:28,336
Focus, focus, focus, focus.

218
00:14:28,636 --> 00:14:30,838
Constantly struggling to bring the team in line

219
00:14:30,858 --> 00:14:31,638
with the initial vision.

220
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,321
Okay, in terms of finding the fun,

221
00:14:36,721 --> 00:14:39,883
on About a Blob, the gameplay was kind of

222
00:14:40,343 --> 00:14:42,505
a little bit Katamari Damacy and a little bit Mario.

223
00:14:44,222 --> 00:14:46,944
uh... figuring out how to do the physics in game play

224
00:14:47,745 --> 00:14:51,728
at vastly different scales because the blob gets really huge within the same

225
00:14:51,988 --> 00:14:52,708
within the same level

226
00:14:53,049 --> 00:14:54,490
with imprecise platforming

227
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,971
with all the various other mechanics that we put in

228
00:14:57,592 --> 00:15:00,634
even though the game is just on the surface looks like this just kind of

229
00:15:00,674 --> 00:15:01,835
simple side-scrolling game

230
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:06,138
it was unintentionally extremely ambitious because we basically had to

231
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:07,419
figure out how to do things

232
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:10,261
uh... that there were not very many examples of

233
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:11,361
out there in other games

234
00:15:12,322 --> 00:15:13,423
in particular how to combine them

235
00:15:14,852 --> 00:15:17,214
The best levels were the hardest to build in a beta blog

236
00:15:18,074 --> 00:15:22,797
because they, typically it was a little bit more exploratory and playful with large changes in scale

237
00:15:23,357 --> 00:15:25,559
which was difficult for the designers to put together.

238
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:28,800
And so it was really hard to keep people focused on those strong elements

239
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,942
because it was much easier to create something that in practice was not as fun.

240
00:15:34,023 --> 00:15:38,126
It felt like we were kind of starting to get it near the end of the project, but the project's over.

241
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:40,387
For Guacamelee!

242
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,742
in those initial meetings the tone was set the tone was stop being so crazy

243
00:15:47,402 --> 00:15:50,523
and get way more conservative with the fundamentals of the game

244
00:15:51,103 --> 00:15:54,925
so guacamelee's gameplay is side-scrolling why? well we have a side-scrolling engine

245
00:15:54,945 --> 00:15:56,945
so let's reuse that let's not reinvent the wheel there

246
00:15:57,806 --> 00:16:01,287
why more traditional platforming rather than this blobby stuff? well because there are

247
00:16:01,307 --> 00:16:04,148
a lot of examples that you can look at out there to see you know

248
00:16:04,888 --> 00:16:06,508
what works well and what doesn't work well

249
00:16:07,451 --> 00:16:12,775
We removed the physics gameplay from the engine because it's a source of constant bugs.

250
00:16:13,215 --> 00:16:15,737
Just getting things to work at all was extremely painful.

251
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:21,401
And obviously, punching, you know, the brawler aspect had a clear hardcore appeal,

252
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:22,622
but again, there were...

253
00:16:23,924 --> 00:16:26,426
there were games that we could look at as a starting point

254
00:16:26,946 --> 00:16:28,227
in order to get the fundamentals in.

255
00:16:29,128 --> 00:16:31,729
So we still had a lot of unknowns, like does Metroidvania

256
00:16:31,969 --> 00:16:33,210
plus brawling equal fun?

257
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,232
Does combining attacks with platforming

258
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,974
actually, is that actually entertaining?

259
00:16:39,454 --> 00:16:42,316
Yeah, so there were a lot of things that we were trying

260
00:16:42,356 --> 00:16:43,537
that we hadn't quite seen before,

261
00:16:43,677 --> 00:16:46,359
but the fundamentals were not unknown.

262
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:51,142
So, yeah, we basically, the basic fundamentals of the game

263
00:16:51,162 --> 00:16:53,043
were much more conservative than what we'd done before.

264
00:16:55,069 --> 00:16:57,530
So to sort of, so that's the concept issues.

265
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:58,830
To summarize,

266
00:17:00,911 --> 00:17:02,712
first, we were much more careful about the game genre

267
00:17:02,732 --> 00:17:03,672
and art style we chose.

268
00:17:04,953 --> 00:17:07,614
We wanted the concept to attract immediate excitement

269
00:17:08,114 --> 00:17:09,995
and also target it properly at people

270
00:17:10,015 --> 00:17:11,275
who were buying download-only games.

271
00:17:12,536 --> 00:17:16,457
Second, we slowly and carefully defined the tone

272
00:17:16,517 --> 00:17:17,998
and spent a huge amount of energy

273
00:17:18,878 --> 00:17:20,839
constantly keeping everyone focused on

274
00:17:21,879 --> 00:17:23,580
on making sure that vision was clean and clear.

275
00:17:25,057 --> 00:17:26,317
A bit more on that later.

276
00:17:27,238 --> 00:17:29,439
Third, we were just much more consistent

277
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:31,480
about the fundamental mechanics of the game

278
00:17:32,141 --> 00:17:34,462
so that we could spend more time refining the game

279
00:17:34,522 --> 00:17:35,443
and trying to make it fun

280
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,003
rather than just making it work.

281
00:17:41,546 --> 00:17:42,567
So on to the development.

282
00:17:42,887 --> 00:17:43,867
Okay, so I'll talk a bit about

283
00:17:43,887 --> 00:17:45,488
how our pre-production process changed,

284
00:17:46,069 --> 00:17:47,810
how we adjusted our approach to deadlines.

285
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:51,251
Some direction changes we made

286
00:17:51,292 --> 00:17:53,032
in terms of adding personality to the game.

287
00:17:54,326 --> 00:17:54,426
uh...

288
00:17:54,986 --> 00:17:56,627
some tool set and process changes

289
00:17:56,647 --> 00:17:58,788
uh... towards just making the game

290
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:03,109
and a little bit of discussion of why we chose our target platform

291
00:18:08,074 --> 00:18:10,175
In terms of pre-production, during About a Blob,

292
00:18:10,195 --> 00:18:12,016
because the founders were on contracts,

293
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:14,838
different founders were on the project at each time,

294
00:18:15,338 --> 00:18:16,779
and then they would kind of shift off.

295
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:19,341
And the result is there was a lot of sort of rebooting

296
00:18:19,381 --> 00:18:20,862
and second-guessing that came from that,

297
00:18:20,922 --> 00:18:22,963
as one person who didn't understand

298
00:18:23,043 --> 00:18:24,484
why certain decisions had been made

299
00:18:25,084 --> 00:18:26,385
questioned all those decisions,

300
00:18:26,825 --> 00:18:28,166
and then maybe changed a bunch of them.

301
00:18:29,887 --> 00:18:31,388
So we kept basically rebooting the game,

302
00:18:31,428 --> 00:18:32,449
trying different directions.

303
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:34,270
And that lack of...

304
00:18:35,222 --> 00:18:37,925
A lack of a clear vision plagued the general production.

305
00:18:38,486 --> 00:18:40,868
Like level, designs for levels were very inconsistent,

306
00:18:40,908 --> 00:18:43,691
or like I said before, they might focus on the weakest parts of the game

307
00:18:43,731 --> 00:18:44,993
instead of the strongest parts of the game.

308
00:18:46,054 --> 00:18:48,837
So, for the Guacamelee pre-production, what we did is,

309
00:18:49,297 --> 00:18:50,038
first we said, okay,

310
00:18:50,779 --> 00:18:53,101
we're gonna take all the founders off of external contracts.

311
00:18:53,462 --> 00:18:56,165
We still did some external contracts, but none of the founders

312
00:18:57,248 --> 00:18:59,630
I guess you could call those the stakeholders, the key stakeholders.

313
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:01,892
None of those guys were on external contracts.

314
00:19:02,252 --> 00:19:04,614
Two of the founders focused full-time on Guacamelee

315
00:19:04,674 --> 00:19:06,776
while the other founder was working on a different project,

316
00:19:06,856 --> 00:19:10,059
but we were in constant discussion about exactly what was going on and why.

317
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,141
We limited the number of people on the team.

318
00:19:13,181 --> 00:19:15,083
By this point, the team was like, I don't know,

319
00:19:15,283 --> 00:19:17,685
maybe we were like 12 people in the studio.

320
00:19:20,122 --> 00:19:23,785
that experience before of people second-guessing, we wanted to avoid that.

321
00:19:23,905 --> 00:19:25,847
So we limited the number of people we had.

322
00:19:27,468 --> 00:19:30,311
We had one designer. We had basically one artist,

323
00:19:31,292 --> 00:19:33,193
one programmer, and a producer

324
00:19:34,234 --> 00:19:35,816
to try to avoid too many cooks in the kitchen.

325
00:19:36,396 --> 00:19:37,957
And we took baby steps with the production.

326
00:19:38,037 --> 00:19:40,420
So we didn't define a vertical slice early.

327
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,722
Whereas on a better blog, we were constantly

328
00:19:42,802 --> 00:19:44,843
redefining new vertical slices, hoping to get it right.

329
00:19:44,863 --> 00:19:47,446
We said, we're not going to worry about the vertical slice yet.

330
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:51,527
We're just gonna work on these small little pieces

331
00:19:51,747 --> 00:19:52,947
and get those working properly,

332
00:19:53,007 --> 00:19:54,727
and then we'll decide what the vertical slice

333
00:19:54,767 --> 00:19:55,568
is supposed to be later.

334
00:19:59,369 --> 00:20:01,629
We set a lot of deadlines in About a Blob,

335
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:04,090
but the deadlines were always failures.

336
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,390
Not in the sense that we didn't hit the deadlines.

337
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,351
We always hit the deadlines.

338
00:20:07,871 --> 00:20:09,411
But the game wasn't good at those deadlines.

339
00:20:09,851 --> 00:20:11,211
And so we would set another deadline,

340
00:20:11,332 --> 00:20:12,592
another vertical slice deadline,

341
00:20:13,192 --> 00:20:15,112
and then that deadline would also fail.

342
00:20:18,055 --> 00:20:19,216
There was this thing we were trying to do,

343
00:20:19,276 --> 00:20:21,016
where we were trying to do, like I alluded to in the last slide,

344
00:20:21,036 --> 00:20:23,016
we were trying to basically put the whole game together at once,

345
00:20:23,817 --> 00:20:25,497
without examining the individual pieces.

346
00:20:26,697 --> 00:20:28,778
So the change we made, there were two aspects to the change.

347
00:20:29,398 --> 00:20:31,699
First, we set deadlines every few months, like we'd done before,

348
00:20:32,339 --> 00:20:34,699
but we changed them to very small and attainable goals,

349
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,700
and then tried to fit those pieces together slowly,

350
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,680
instead of all at once.

351
00:20:40,821 --> 00:20:41,561
At the same time...

352
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,141
Almost all of our deadlines were shown externally,

353
00:20:45,561 --> 00:20:47,022
which we hadn't exactly done in the past,

354
00:20:47,522 --> 00:20:48,622
in order to collect feedback,

355
00:20:48,962 --> 00:20:50,263
also to create tension on the team,

356
00:20:50,423 --> 00:20:53,444
because when you're not creating a vertical slice,

357
00:20:54,505 --> 00:20:56,506
it can be hard to kind of get the team,

358
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:57,847
I feel like it can be hard to get the team

359
00:20:57,887 --> 00:20:59,827
kind of focused and intense on what they're trying to do.

360
00:21:00,548 --> 00:21:02,689
So showing publicly meant that there was gonna be

361
00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:04,770
some kind of tension in anything we did,

362
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:06,110
a pitch, a drawing, whatever.

363
00:21:07,486 --> 00:21:09,307
We showed the publishers doing pre-production.

364
00:21:09,867 --> 00:21:12,308
We showed to the public after pre-production

365
00:21:12,389 --> 00:21:13,749
for basically all of our deadlines.

366
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,471
And as a result, the deadlines had to be polished,

367
00:21:16,611 --> 00:21:18,152
so the team got to practice polish.

368
00:21:18,712 --> 00:21:20,673
We got to see what each person on the team was capable of,

369
00:21:21,634 --> 00:21:22,775
which was very important.

370
00:21:24,095 --> 00:21:25,076
It let us practice planning,

371
00:21:25,456 --> 00:21:28,138
and very importantly, it let us practice cutting.

372
00:21:28,698 --> 00:21:30,419
It gave us a lot of practice at figuring out

373
00:21:30,459 --> 00:21:31,800
what was the most important stuff

374
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,461
that we needed to get into whatever the deliverable was.

375
00:21:35,849 --> 00:21:38,111
which is different than my experience working on retail games.

376
00:21:39,993 --> 00:21:45,058
I didn't, I mean I don't, I haven't worked on a retail game that actually scored very high on Metacritic.

377
00:21:45,739 --> 00:21:46,299
But, uh,

378
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:51,885
my experience there was there's this thing with the public showing where you're just kind of throwing the kitchen sink in all the time.

379
00:21:53,486 --> 00:21:56,790
So, the sequence was we made a one-page pitch that was for publishers.

380
00:21:57,776 --> 00:21:59,737
We made a three-page pitch with mock-up screenshots.

381
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:00,758
That was also for publishers.

382
00:22:01,318 --> 00:22:03,039
We made a concept video and a combat demo,

383
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:04,080
which we showed to publishers,

384
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,601
and I'm gonna show that in a second

385
00:22:05,661 --> 00:22:06,622
to give you some idea of,

386
00:22:06,642 --> 00:22:09,564
uh, sort of how rough it was that we...

387
00:22:10,004 --> 00:22:11,585
how rough this stuff is that we were willing to show.

388
00:22:13,086 --> 00:22:14,307
Uh, we made a playable intro.

389
00:22:14,547 --> 00:22:16,388
So not really a vertical slice, but approaching it.

390
00:22:16,989 --> 00:22:18,510
And we intended to send that to publishers,

391
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:20,791
but we weren't... we didn't quite feel good enough about it yet,

392
00:22:20,811 --> 00:22:21,191
so we didn't.

393
00:22:22,032 --> 00:22:24,193
Uh, and we made a playable demo for the IGF next.

394
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:29,446
And then finally we made a big replayable demo, and that was our first PAX demo, our first public showing.

395
00:22:30,747 --> 00:22:33,930
So I'm going to show the concept video that we made.

396
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:39,815
This was made...

397
00:22:39,835 --> 00:22:45,319
This was made completely in Flash, so there wasn't really any...

398
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,621
Like, the game didn't work at this time.

399
00:24:19,615 --> 00:24:34,206
Yeah, it's interesting for me to see that, to look at that concept video because, uh...

400
00:24:35,213 --> 00:24:39,256
When I look at it now, what I realize is that basically we had the whole game in that concept video.

401
00:24:39,856 --> 00:24:42,838
Except for, I mean, there are some very important differences,

402
00:24:43,058 --> 00:24:46,459
but the essence of the game and how the game feels and flows,

403
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:50,702
and to a large degree what the combat was like was all in that video, before we even had the game.

404
00:24:53,083 --> 00:24:57,966
Next I'm going to show a combat demo that we showed the publishers.

405
00:25:01,087 --> 00:25:03,108
I'm just going to show a bit of it, because it's long.

406
00:25:06,521 --> 00:25:07,301
Goodbye.

407
00:25:07,361 --> 00:25:08,601
Goodbye.

408
00:25:42,837 --> 00:25:44,799
You get the idea.

409
00:26:04,357 --> 00:26:05,657
So yeah, we showed those to publishers.

410
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:09,258
The response to the concept video was sort of like,

411
00:26:10,058 --> 00:26:11,579
you know, sort of cautious interest.

412
00:26:11,619 --> 00:26:13,079
I mean, at that point in the project, you know,

413
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:14,960
the publishers are always positive no matter what,

414
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,961
basically, unless it's really bad.

415
00:26:18,241 --> 00:26:19,782
You know, they don't seem to want to,

416
00:26:19,882 --> 00:26:21,802
they don't want to, you know, cut off the tree

417
00:26:21,862 --> 00:26:22,963
before they can see what's coming out.

418
00:26:23,703 --> 00:26:25,623
Although we did get some comments like,

419
00:26:26,344 --> 00:26:27,684
oh, your game looks like a Flash game,

420
00:26:28,584 --> 00:26:29,125
which it was.

421
00:26:31,045 --> 00:26:31,945
In the combat demo,

422
00:26:33,922 --> 00:26:36,163
I think if you look at that, you know, the combat in that demo

423
00:26:36,223 --> 00:26:38,243
is way more complicated than the actual game.

424
00:26:38,584 --> 00:26:40,684
And that's kind of an example of, like, that vision thing again,

425
00:26:40,744 --> 00:26:43,085
where we started to drift away with the combat

426
00:26:43,125 --> 00:26:44,246
and make it really complicated,

427
00:26:44,446 --> 00:26:46,267
and then later there was a turning around

428
00:26:46,307 --> 00:26:48,948
and bringing it back to the core vision and simplifying it.

429
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:56,251
About a Blob had... it had personality.

430
00:26:56,831 --> 00:26:58,172
It had humor. It had an identity.

431
00:26:58,192 --> 00:27:02,193
Uh, but it just wasn't really...

432
00:27:03,416 --> 00:27:05,119
It wasn't zany, exactly.

433
00:27:05,219 --> 00:27:08,103
I mean, it felt like we were playing kind of safe with that game.

434
00:27:09,325 --> 00:27:11,469
So for Guacamelee!, one of the things that we did

435
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:13,893
is we decided to just say yes to more stuff.

436
00:27:14,871 --> 00:27:19,172
Now, what stuff you say yes to is a challenging problem.

437
00:27:19,292 --> 00:27:22,692
But just changing the mindset from no to yes

438
00:27:22,972 --> 00:27:25,513
was an important adjustment for us.

439
00:27:26,233 --> 00:27:29,093
So we tried to more aggressively grab humor and personality

440
00:27:29,153 --> 00:27:30,394
from multiple people on the team.

441
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:32,294
We would have team meetings all the time

442
00:27:32,354 --> 00:27:34,974
to see in progress stuff from all the departments.

443
00:27:35,795 --> 00:27:37,315
And people would say, you know, during those things, like,

444
00:27:37,915 --> 00:27:38,415
you know what?

445
00:27:38,495 --> 00:27:40,976
We should have a chicken head pop out at the side here.

446
00:27:41,496 --> 00:27:43,036
Or we should have, you know, or a.

447
00:27:44,436 --> 00:27:48,597
or they would suggest a character or some way in which the combat would change

448
00:27:48,637 --> 00:27:49,757
and so we would just

449
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:53,058
we would write those down, the producer would write those down and we would just

450
00:27:53,698 --> 00:27:54,559
kind of shove it in

451
00:27:55,019 --> 00:27:58,240
we would let people on the team, because it's a small team so this was scalable

452
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:02,521
we would let people on the team just kind of like put stuff in, like oh I'm working on this task

453
00:28:03,041 --> 00:28:06,062
but while I'm at it I think I'm going to make this thing, this guy say something

454
00:28:07,202 --> 00:28:08,362
uh... we would let them put that in

455
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:11,060
understanding that maybe we're going to take it out later

456
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,722
but we would let people kind of just experiment and express their personality into the game

457
00:28:19,624 --> 00:28:23,065
i think you know the overall effect was first of all a much more positive atmosphere on

458
00:28:23,085 --> 00:28:25,806
the team like people were excited about what they were putting into the game

459
00:28:26,047 --> 00:28:30,369
but also we were finding people on the game who had certain talents that we didn't really

460
00:28:30,449 --> 00:28:30,949
expect

461
00:28:31,449 --> 00:28:33,230
like one of the programmers on the team

462
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:36,531
he did a lot of that he did a fair bit of dialogue in the game and he's

463
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:39,851
he's done dialogue since, and he has this sense of humor.

464
00:28:40,231 --> 00:28:42,853
You wouldn't necessarily expect to put the programmer,

465
00:28:43,133 --> 00:28:44,974
get the programmer involved in the dialogue for the game,

466
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:46,175
but it's something that really worked.

467
00:28:48,917 --> 00:28:51,018
So I guess I could say that even though Boutoblob,

468
00:28:51,719 --> 00:28:53,380
Boutoblob did have humor and personality, I think.

469
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,961
So the change here wasn't in degrees,

470
00:28:56,001 --> 00:28:57,662
but there was kind of a mental shift

471
00:28:57,762 --> 00:29:00,404
from no or playing it safe to yes,

472
00:29:00,444 --> 00:29:01,605
let's see how far we can push it.

473
00:29:02,939 --> 00:29:05,863
And here's some examples of those things that people just kind of pushed in on their own.

474
00:29:06,404 --> 00:29:11,272
So on the left, internet memes, which were somewhat controversial,

475
00:29:12,354 --> 00:29:14,818
but nevertheless added a lot of personality and character.

476
00:29:15,714 --> 00:29:16,374
uh... on the top

477
00:29:16,754 --> 00:29:17,415
on the top right

478
00:29:17,675 --> 00:29:19,256
we have these sort of

479
00:29:19,756 --> 00:29:22,338
these power-up animations that would come in when you got a power that was

480
00:29:22,358 --> 00:29:23,699
something that just kind of happened at the end

481
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:25,160
based on a suggestion

482
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,541
the suggestion was like

483
00:29:27,001 --> 00:29:30,124
it would be much better if you got you know the game needs these little

484
00:29:30,144 --> 00:29:31,244
interstitial animations

485
00:29:31,665 --> 00:29:34,066
and I bet we can do it really cheap by just using the arts

486
00:29:34,406 --> 00:29:35,247
our art that we already have

487
00:29:36,621 --> 00:29:39,423
uh... flame face the character that was sort of a just a joke

488
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:42,585
we were talking about who should the bad guys be there's a bunch of

489
00:29:43,085 --> 00:29:46,608
bad guys put out there. One idea was well we should just have a guy with a flame for a face

490
00:29:47,208 --> 00:29:48,549
it was just sort of a flip comment

491
00:29:49,209 --> 00:29:49,530
and then

492
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:52,672
it became you know a joke like yeah flame face that flame face guy

493
00:29:52,932 --> 00:29:55,434
and then over time yeah we just kind of pushed it into the game

494
00:29:56,174 --> 00:29:58,876
turning into the chicken a similar thing you know the question is asked

495
00:30:00,117 --> 00:30:03,119
where are the chickens there should be chickens in the game okay we put chickens in

496
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:04,200
now we should punch the chickens

497
00:30:05,092 --> 00:30:07,193
Okay, we start punching the chickens, then we should be a chicken.

498
00:30:08,293 --> 00:30:09,473
Okay, it goes into the game.

499
00:30:13,054 --> 00:30:14,074
In terms of the toolset,

500
00:30:15,435 --> 00:30:16,395
okay, so I think, you know,

501
00:30:18,015 --> 00:30:22,196
it's important when you're making the game to be able to throw stuff away

502
00:30:23,137 --> 00:30:24,477
and to change stuff really fast.

503
00:30:26,417 --> 00:30:29,318
For a better blob, we could kind of do that, but we couldn't do it fast enough.

504
00:30:31,018 --> 00:30:33,139
We were using our own proprietary engine.

505
00:30:34,657 --> 00:30:38,862
And so there was a lot of thinking about how to change our development process to be faster.

506
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:43,186
We considered changing to maybe some other middleware engine,

507
00:30:43,887 --> 00:30:48,372
but moved away from that after considering the advantages that we'd received from

508
00:30:48,912 --> 00:30:53,056
our own engine in terms of portability, like we were able to do a launch title on Vita as a result of our

509
00:30:53,841 --> 00:30:54,521
our own engine,

510
00:30:55,641 --> 00:30:57,162
just sort of the independence that it brings.

511
00:30:57,722 --> 00:30:59,383
Instead, what we did is we focused on making

512
00:30:59,423 --> 00:31:02,425
a lot of incremental changes in a lot of different places

513
00:31:03,105 --> 00:31:04,786
with a couple examples to follow,

514
00:31:05,346 --> 00:31:08,067
with the key kind of thrust being that

515
00:31:09,408 --> 00:31:10,969
we wanted to make an attitude change

516
00:31:12,169 --> 00:31:13,910
where people would kind of reflect more

517
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:15,731
on how efficient their process was

518
00:31:15,851 --> 00:31:18,172
and look for ways to simplify what they were doing.

519
00:31:20,594 --> 00:31:21,354
So problem one...

520
00:31:23,477 --> 00:31:25,097
we made, I hope it's visible, yeah.

521
00:31:25,237 --> 00:31:27,658
So the collision hulls for about a blob,

522
00:31:28,338 --> 00:31:31,279
they had to be made extremely precisely and smoothly

523
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:32,719
because the blob is a blob

524
00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:34,560
and it needs to not get caught up on corners.

525
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,581
And that takes a lot of time for designers to do.

526
00:31:38,001 --> 00:31:39,201
As you can see, the game world there,

527
00:31:39,221 --> 00:31:40,642
you can see exactly what you're looking at

528
00:31:40,662 --> 00:31:42,342
or you have some idea, oh, here's a gear

529
00:31:42,422 --> 00:31:44,803
and here's a crusher or something.

530
00:31:45,963 --> 00:31:48,984
The art team would import this stuff in a 3D Studio Max.

531
00:31:50,136 --> 00:31:51,877
But they couldn't use that stuff in Max.

532
00:31:52,017 --> 00:31:53,658
They just, they had to use it as a guide

533
00:31:54,098 --> 00:31:54,779
for what they would make.

534
00:31:55,139 --> 00:31:57,621
And so the iteration process was slow and painful.

535
00:32:00,863 --> 00:32:03,064
So we switched from this kind of curvy whole stuff

536
00:32:03,145 --> 00:32:05,726
to a rectilinear style, more a traditional platformer style.

537
00:32:06,227 --> 00:32:07,948
So the designers could plop down blocks.

538
00:32:08,268 --> 00:32:10,309
We didn't remove the ability to do the custom work.

539
00:32:11,058 --> 00:32:13,798
but it was just kind of a process thing that generally they didn't use it.

540
00:32:14,879 --> 00:32:15,479
And the artists,

541
00:32:15,999 --> 00:32:17,839
they were able to import these hulls

542
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:22,701
as flat geometry and just use it as geometry in 3D Studio and apply textures

543
00:32:22,761 --> 00:32:25,241
on top of it so we could very quickly get something

544
00:32:25,841 --> 00:32:27,422
vaguely passable into the game.

545
00:32:27,922 --> 00:32:31,743
And when there were changes to the level geometry, it wasn't that big a deal to fix it.

546
00:32:33,133 --> 00:32:36,775
A similar problem, in A Better Blob we had pretty weak visual effects.

547
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:45,217
We went to a PAX and we sat beside Retrograde, which if you're familiar with that game, has

548
00:32:45,437 --> 00:32:46,857
an enormous number of effects.

549
00:32:47,818 --> 00:32:52,599
And it was just depressing to see how far off we were from another indie developer.

550
00:32:54,817 --> 00:32:58,459
Our visual system, our effects system was visual driven.

551
00:32:58,539 --> 00:33:03,522
So it was intended for the artists to be able to use these visual tools to make their effects.

552
00:33:04,202 --> 00:33:08,825
But in practice, the artists didn't, I don't know, like it or it just wasn't good enough.

553
00:33:09,225 --> 00:33:10,966
And the designers ended up making all the effects.

554
00:33:11,387 --> 00:33:13,688
And then those effects, you know, I mean, they're not artists.

555
00:33:13,708 --> 00:33:15,569
The artists are going to be better at that kind of stuff.

556
00:33:15,609 --> 00:33:16,350
So it wasn't great.

557
00:33:18,004 --> 00:33:21,146
So after thinking about it for a while, first we thought, well, maybe we'll make the tools better.

558
00:33:21,546 --> 00:33:24,367
But that's expensive. It's hard. It's a difficult problem.

559
00:33:24,608 --> 00:33:28,610
So instead, we flipped it around completely, and we said, you know, we're not going to make the tools better for the artists.

560
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,211
What we're going to do is we're going to make the tools better for the programmers,

561
00:33:31,271 --> 00:33:32,972
and we're going to let the programmers drive the effects.

562
00:33:33,612 --> 00:33:38,057
So we made changes to the engines so that we could put shaders into the engine much more easily and quickly.

563
00:33:38,077 --> 00:33:40,280
That you could make more changes on the fly.

564
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:46,547
And we added a system so that the programmers could easily put handles on their shaders so that the artists could tune the shaders.

565
00:33:46,887 --> 00:33:51,492
So we changed into this process where it was actually the programmers driving the initial effects.

566
00:33:51,953 --> 00:33:55,416
Like, oh, I think we should have smoke here, or a waterfall, or something like that.

567
00:33:56,212 --> 00:34:00,217
we would make these prototype effects, add handles to them, and then the artists would tune them.

568
00:34:00,597 --> 00:34:03,801
So they wouldn't make the effects, but they would refine the effects.

569
00:34:04,582 --> 00:34:07,866
Make them arty. Make them just way better than the programmers could do.

570
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:14,694
Finally, I'll talk sort of quickly about the target platform.

571
00:34:16,098 --> 00:34:18,481
We released our previous games on PS3 and PS Vita.

572
00:34:18,962 --> 00:34:21,124
Our first about a blob was a pub fun game,

573
00:34:21,144 --> 00:34:22,446
which means you get like a,

574
00:34:22,486 --> 00:34:24,508
there's like an advance against royalties arrangement,

575
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:26,871
but you get paid after the project ships.

576
00:34:27,032 --> 00:34:29,354
So you have to be able to finance the project to that point.

577
00:34:31,377 --> 00:34:32,919
For Guacamelee!, we decided, you know what,

578
00:34:32,959 --> 00:34:35,261
we're gonna just reevaluate everything.

579
00:34:36,284 --> 00:34:37,885
The change was, there was no change.

580
00:34:38,125 --> 00:34:39,547
We ended up doing exactly the same thing.

581
00:34:40,127 --> 00:34:41,868
But only after a lot of thinking about it,

582
00:34:42,209 --> 00:34:44,470
and talking to people, and looking at all our options.

583
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:46,612
So I guess you could say there wasn't a change,

584
00:34:46,692 --> 00:34:48,893
exactly, in the outcome, but there was more of a,

585
00:34:50,315 --> 00:34:51,596
a more aggressive change in attitude,

586
00:34:51,636 --> 00:34:53,957
like we have to be very aggressive about,

587
00:34:55,058 --> 00:34:56,559
about questioning our presumptions

588
00:34:56,619 --> 00:34:57,920
about what's the right thing for us to do.

589
00:35:00,212 --> 00:35:02,713
So, just some brief logic for why we ended up doing what we did.

590
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:05,535
Why in consoles? Because we have experience there.

591
00:35:05,796 --> 00:35:07,837
Because there's some barriers to entry there,

592
00:35:07,997 --> 00:35:10,859
and so if you can get over those barriers, it's good for you as a developer.

593
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,341
Why PSN? Why self-publish?

594
00:35:16,383 --> 00:35:16,723
We have...

595
00:35:17,324 --> 00:35:21,006
The studio is in a position to largely or entirely self-finance the game,

596
00:35:21,106 --> 00:35:22,027
so we didn't need a publisher.

597
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:26,007
We've had some bad experiences of our own with publishers

598
00:35:26,027 --> 00:35:27,809
when we were working on retail games.

599
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:30,131
A couple of us worked on a project where

600
00:35:31,012 --> 00:35:32,213
a game that was supposed to be a port

601
00:35:32,694 --> 00:35:34,515
was, for marketing reasons, labeled as a sequel,

602
00:35:35,236 --> 00:35:36,777
which meant that the team was crushed under work

603
00:35:37,158 --> 00:35:37,558
and it was...

604
00:35:38,379 --> 00:35:41,321
it felt like it was impossible for the game to get a good review.

605
00:35:43,695 --> 00:35:45,516
Another experience was one of the other founders.

606
00:35:46,057 --> 00:35:47,458
He worked on retail games for PC.

607
00:35:47,498 --> 00:35:48,658
Worked on a retail game for PC.

608
00:35:48,678 --> 00:35:49,739
They had a publishing deal.

609
00:35:49,779 --> 00:35:50,680
The game was on the shelves.

610
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:51,740
The game was selling.

611
00:35:52,261 --> 00:35:54,542
The publisher simply refused to give them any royalties.

612
00:35:56,423 --> 00:35:57,404
So we were afraid of that.

613
00:35:57,644 --> 00:35:58,965
But we talked to publishers all the time.

614
00:35:59,205 --> 00:36:01,066
And for every project, we tried to pitch it to publishers

615
00:36:01,486 --> 00:36:03,327
in the hopes that maybe there could be an arrangement,

616
00:36:03,427 --> 00:36:04,828
something that would make sense for both sides,

617
00:36:05,168 --> 00:36:06,609
but also because they see a lot of games.

618
00:36:06,989 --> 00:36:08,190
And so we would show them the game,

619
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:10,391
and we would just try to gauge or read between the lines

620
00:36:10,431 --> 00:36:11,052
in their feedback.

621
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:17,027
They see a lot of pitches. We're trying to leverage that experience for our own benefit.

622
00:36:18,909 --> 00:36:20,612
So we talked to Sony about PubFund early.

623
00:36:21,693 --> 00:36:22,374
They made an offer.

624
00:36:23,696 --> 00:36:25,438
Wasn't quite what we were hoping for.

625
00:36:26,251 --> 00:36:28,432
We showed the game publicly, it got a great response.

626
00:36:28,773 --> 00:36:32,255
We started talking to publishers, we were very close to signing with a publisher.

627
00:36:32,795 --> 00:36:36,218
And then Sony came back and gave us a slightly different offer for the PubFund.

628
00:36:36,638 --> 00:36:38,539
And because of our good working relationship with them,

629
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,121
because we had actually had good trust with them,

630
00:36:41,301 --> 00:36:42,862
we knew that there weren't going to be shenanigans.

631
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:46,905
And because philosophically the company,

632
00:36:46,925 --> 00:36:48,986
founders are conservative financially,

633
00:36:49,387 --> 00:36:52,689
we were very concerned about our minimum return rather than maximizing our return.

634
00:36:53,309 --> 00:36:54,810
It seemed like a great deal for us, so we did it.

635
00:36:56,901 --> 00:37:00,603
So to summarize, we had key team members attach the project

636
00:37:01,284 --> 00:37:05,266
day-to-day like key founders with a strong vision in place,

637
00:37:05,947 --> 00:37:08,148
and so we could focus on building the pieces one by one.

638
00:37:08,728 --> 00:37:11,130
We used external deadlines to drive the development,

639
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:12,851
and that dovetailed with the marketing,

640
00:37:12,871 --> 00:37:14,111
which I'll talk about next,

641
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:16,613
and we showed all our milestones externally.

642
00:37:17,914 --> 00:37:20,195
We became more free with letting ideas into the game,

643
00:37:21,316 --> 00:37:24,298
trying to pursue, pull out the personality of the team.

644
00:37:25,341 --> 00:37:27,202
and off-the-cuff stuff was taken seriously,

645
00:37:28,023 --> 00:37:29,504
but also vetted by the producer.

646
00:37:30,845 --> 00:37:33,866
We kept our existing engine, but we focused changes in places

647
00:37:33,906 --> 00:37:35,608
where there were productivity issues.

648
00:37:35,648 --> 00:37:37,509
So instead of making the engine more complicated,

649
00:37:38,449 --> 00:37:40,451
we looked at ways of simplifying our processes

650
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:41,571
or making things more efficient.

651
00:37:43,012 --> 00:37:45,154
And finally, yeah, we went through the same

652
00:37:45,174 --> 00:37:46,174
distribution channel again,

653
00:37:47,976 --> 00:37:49,697
but only after a lot of thought.

654
00:37:50,817 --> 00:37:53,139
It was useful for us to explore all our options again.

655
00:37:57,164 --> 00:37:58,125
Okay, so into the marketing.

656
00:37:58,145 --> 00:38:03,390
I'll talk a bit about how we chose to change, how we revealed the game,

657
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:06,132
relationship with marketing in general,

658
00:38:06,152 --> 00:38:09,875
uh, and attitude change with respect to launching the game.

659
00:38:11,457 --> 00:38:14,880
So with Aboda Blob, it just seemed like nobody knew that the game existed

660
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:15,981
when it came out.

661
00:38:16,001 --> 00:38:18,403
Uh, like, when an article would go up,

662
00:38:19,124 --> 00:38:21,646
uh, the comments would suggest that most people had never heard of the game.

663
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:28,067
You could tell that because they would engage in a flame war about how the game was clearly ripped off from GISH.

664
00:38:29,869 --> 00:38:33,774
There was just low anticipation, and there were very few day one reviews.

665
00:38:35,917 --> 00:38:37,920
We were very precious with About a Blob.

666
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:42,107
We were scared to show it frequently or in an early state

667
00:38:42,167 --> 00:38:46,791
because we were scared that things might change and it would somehow confuse people out there.

668
00:38:47,771 --> 00:38:50,374
We were concerned about polish, that it wasn't to a high enough standard.

669
00:38:50,834 --> 00:38:53,336
So for Guacamelee!, because that obviously didn't work,

670
00:38:54,097 --> 00:38:55,838
we just said, okay, we're just going to put it out there the whole time.

671
00:38:56,119 --> 00:38:58,601
We're not going to hide it. We're going to put things out pretty early.

672
00:39:00,262 --> 00:39:02,004
So because the deadlines were based around showings...

673
00:39:03,263 --> 00:39:05,525
we kind of frequently had these things that we could show.

674
00:39:05,985 --> 00:39:06,745
We announced the game,

675
00:39:07,385 --> 00:39:09,626
not even when we were fully out of pre-production,

676
00:39:10,067 --> 00:39:12,168
and thereafter we just tried to attend any public shows

677
00:39:12,188 --> 00:39:13,048
that we possibly could.

678
00:39:13,548 --> 00:39:15,669
Went to PAX, we had presence at GameCom,

679
00:39:15,949 --> 00:39:18,390
we went to E3, fortunately we got an Indicade,

680
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:21,112
we were at GDC, but we would also do local shows.

681
00:39:22,432 --> 00:39:24,473
In Toronto, in New York, in London,

682
00:39:24,553 --> 00:39:25,854
people would sometimes email and say,

683
00:39:25,874 --> 00:39:27,155
hey, we think your art is cool,

684
00:39:27,415 --> 00:39:29,356
could your game be at our event?

685
00:39:29,416 --> 00:39:31,396
And we're like, sure, here's a build, just send the build in.

686
00:39:33,317 --> 00:39:38,240
We first revealed around IGF 2011 with an announcement trailer.

687
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,122
And like I said, we were just exiting pre-production.

688
00:39:40,922 --> 00:39:41,843
So why reveal then?

689
00:39:43,083 --> 00:39:44,544
We had something we thought was interesting.

690
00:39:45,725 --> 00:39:46,745
We were committed to the game.

691
00:39:47,606 --> 00:39:49,807
And it also helped put pressure on the team to deliver.

692
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,329
So I'm just going to show the announcement trailer

693
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:56,952
to give you some idea, if you can remember the old video,

694
00:39:58,252 --> 00:40:00,834
sort of how early, comparatively early this is.

695
00:42:04,375 --> 00:42:06,616
So yeah, I don't know about, I don't know what you guys see.

696
00:42:06,636 --> 00:42:08,336
I, I, it looks awful.

697
00:42:09,116 --> 00:42:10,937
Uh, this is all I see.

698
00:42:11,537 --> 00:42:13,778
It looks, the environments look bad.

699
00:42:13,798 --> 00:42:16,098
I see all sorts of gameplay problems,

700
00:42:16,358 --> 00:42:17,658
jerking of the camera, stuff like that.

701
00:42:18,499 --> 00:42:20,379
The point is to say, I, I don't know what you see.

702
00:42:21,159 --> 00:42:23,280
Uh, is that we felt nervous about it.

703
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,200
We forced ourselves to put it out anyway.

704
00:42:26,241 --> 00:42:27,261
And as you can see also, we kind of,

705
00:42:27,561 --> 00:42:29,501
we used part of the concept video at the beginning there.

706
00:42:29,801 --> 00:42:30,582
Kind of reusing stuff.

707
00:42:33,809 --> 00:42:37,730
For a Better Blob, the quality of coverage from media outlets was pretty bad.

708
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:41,252
We did all our own marketing on the first game. We were extremely green.

709
00:42:42,212 --> 00:42:45,273
We were not sure how to do things, or in what order to do things,

710
00:42:45,493 --> 00:42:48,854
or even what good results would look like or should look like.

711
00:42:49,315 --> 00:42:51,916
But we saw other independent developers doing it themselves,

712
00:42:51,956 --> 00:42:54,657
and so we thought, oh, well, naturally we should do it ourselves.

713
00:42:55,577 --> 00:42:57,598
And in retrospect, that was not a good idea.

714
00:42:58,858 --> 00:43:01,479
In part because we don't really have, especially at the time,

715
00:43:01,499 --> 00:43:02,400
we didn't really have good...

716
00:43:03,117 --> 00:43:05,858
personalities on the team for pitching the game ourselves.

717
00:43:07,798 --> 00:43:09,398
So we hired a PR firm

718
00:43:10,699 --> 00:43:11,639
near the end of a,

719
00:43:12,019 --> 00:43:12,919
there were like three projects,

720
00:43:12,959 --> 00:43:14,879
About a Blob, Mutant Blobs Attack, and then Guacamelee.

721
00:43:14,899 --> 00:43:17,160
We hired a PR firm near the end of Mutant Blobs Attack.

722
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,040
And we did that because we went to a PAX

723
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,381
and there was another indie game in front of us

724
00:43:23,581 --> 00:43:26,242
which is sort of similar kind of game in a lot of ways.

725
00:43:26,782 --> 00:43:28,762
And we noticed that they were getting a huge amount of press

726
00:43:28,822 --> 00:43:29,562
attending their booth.

727
00:43:30,262 --> 00:43:33,084
And we went up and we talked to them and we looked at what they were doing

728
00:43:33,104 --> 00:43:36,225
and it turned out that they were kind of signed on with some small publisher

729
00:43:36,265 --> 00:43:39,887
and the publisher had hired a PR firm and the PR firm was just bringing all these media people

730
00:43:40,628 --> 00:43:42,549
to the booth and so we realized we were...

731
00:43:42,569 --> 00:43:45,710
we were being idiots.

732
00:43:49,195 --> 00:43:53,699
So yeah, we worked with a PR firm basically throughout the entirety of Guacamelee's production.

733
00:43:53,759 --> 00:43:57,142
I mean, not in a continuous flow, but like every time there was going to be some kind of event,

734
00:43:57,202 --> 00:43:58,684
we would get back in touch and work with them.

735
00:43:59,264 --> 00:44:02,527
So they helped us arrange stuff with the trade shows and do key announcements.

736
00:44:02,547 --> 00:44:05,570
They organized meetings, advised on approach, timing.

737
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:07,912
They helped us later with our press tour.

738
00:44:07,992 --> 00:44:09,493
They facilitated relationships.

739
00:44:09,553 --> 00:44:13,777
They just, it's like, basically, it's, I mean, it's obvious, but it's a job.

740
00:44:13,797 --> 00:44:15,539
There's a reason why people have a job doing this.

741
00:44:16,375 --> 00:44:17,937
They know something if they've been doing it.

742
00:44:18,037 --> 00:44:18,758
We know nothing.

743
00:44:18,938 --> 00:44:21,361
So we should try to work with somebody who knows something

744
00:44:21,401 --> 00:44:21,922
in order to learn.

745
00:44:24,586 --> 00:44:25,847
Finally, the launch.

746
00:44:26,768 --> 00:44:28,030
The launch also went very poorly.

747
00:44:29,232 --> 00:44:30,433
There were basically no previews.

748
00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:34,092
The review camp, the Metacritic review camp wasn't too bad

749
00:44:34,452 --> 00:44:35,673
for a small indie game.

750
00:44:36,313 --> 00:44:37,474
But a lot of them came in late.

751
00:44:38,675 --> 00:44:40,476
Not great store placement, although it wasn't terrible

752
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:42,177
because we were in pub fun, Sony was supportive.

753
00:44:43,058 --> 00:44:44,699
And we were crushed under other games.

754
00:44:45,079 --> 00:44:46,320
Stacking released the same day.

755
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,641
Plants vs. Zombies released the same day.

756
00:44:49,382 --> 00:44:51,323
Bionic Commando 2 released one week before.

757
00:44:51,703 --> 00:44:53,244
There was another indie game called Explodemon

758
00:44:53,264 --> 00:44:54,125
that released the same day.

759
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:55,986
And we didn't know that.

760
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:58,968
We didn't know that that was happening until a week before.

761
00:44:59,953 --> 00:45:01,635
And then, when we heard that, we were like,

762
00:45:02,135 --> 00:45:04,716
oh, okay, well, should we change?

763
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:07,738
Uh, you know, and we're like, uh, I don't think, uh,

764
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:09,059
you know, it's too much effort.

765
00:45:12,661 --> 00:45:13,402
So, the change?

766
00:45:14,022 --> 00:45:16,484
I mean, not one change, just sort of waking up.

767
00:45:17,404 --> 00:45:20,006
Um, we took the launch extremely seriously

768
00:45:20,306 --> 00:45:22,227
for Guacamelee!, we planned it long in advance.

769
00:45:22,448 --> 00:45:23,388
There are many differences.

770
00:45:25,325 --> 00:45:30,369
We did a proper press tour multiple weeks before, so we had a proper preview build that we could leave with people.

771
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:35,933
We attended a lot of trade shows near the launch, so we could get coverage. We were fortunate to be in the IGF.

772
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:40,176
But we went to GDC and we were in the Sony booth. We were at PAX East.

773
00:45:40,857 --> 00:45:45,120
We had some award nominations around that time, so we got kind of coverage from that.

774
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:48,702
But because we planned it properly, we had proper previews.

775
00:45:50,399 --> 00:45:56,502
and proper reviews. The PR firm helped us set a proper embargo date. We had an exclusive

776
00:45:56,562 --> 00:46:06,505
review, which meant that we had great placement. That was on IGN. We had excellent store placement,

777
00:46:06,586 --> 00:46:10,707
thanks to Sony. We worked closely with Sony on this. We talked to them, tried to figure

778
00:46:10,787 --> 00:46:13,848
out when is a good time, when are there not going to be games coming out.

779
00:46:15,172 --> 00:46:18,513
We even moved our dates around because we realized that there was another indie game,

780
00:46:18,553 --> 00:46:22,654
that was Monaco, was coming out when we planned to come out.

781
00:46:23,834 --> 00:46:25,975
And we talked to them and said, oh, maybe there's a problem.

782
00:46:26,355 --> 00:46:28,255
They weren't worried about it, but we were very worried about it,

783
00:46:28,335 --> 00:46:29,455
so we just moved our dates back.

784
00:46:31,416 --> 00:46:36,357
So I guess overall you could say, as I say, not one thing, just everything.

785
00:46:36,897 --> 00:46:38,518
Like, this is a serious issue.

786
00:46:39,698 --> 00:46:41,138
We were, yeah, very naive initially.

787
00:46:42,418 --> 00:46:46,080
So to summarize, we put the game out there into the world constantly.

788
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:49,142
We didn't hide it, and we let it change as we went and didn't worry about that.

789
00:46:49,442 --> 00:46:53,304
Because it was more important to kind of create awareness, especially for a small title like ours.

790
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:57,406
We accepted that we needed help, so we hired a PR firm.

791
00:46:58,346 --> 00:47:00,567
In a way, that's like, it's kind of an ego thing, right?

792
00:47:00,847 --> 00:47:02,168
Like, I can do it, we're indie.

793
00:47:02,888 --> 00:47:03,509
We can do anything.

794
00:47:05,169 --> 00:47:05,810
But, we can't.

795
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:13,277
And finally we took the launch extremely seriously, whereas we hadn't, you know, you're at the end of the project, you're exhausted.

796
00:47:13,617 --> 00:47:16,238
It's just such a big deal to even finish a game and get it done.

797
00:47:18,479 --> 00:47:22,881
We changed our point of view, like, it's not done until three or four months after the game is released.

798
00:47:26,703 --> 00:47:27,383
So, wrapping up.

799
00:47:28,906 --> 00:47:32,067
The results, well, I mean, I'm doing the talk because the results were good.

800
00:47:32,968 --> 00:47:37,890
The game was a success, it was well-received, it got stronger views, it sold well,

801
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:42,132
we continue to release it, it's going to come out soon on additional platforms.

802
00:47:43,452 --> 00:47:47,634
Basically, it just eclipses our first game in almost every single way.

803
00:47:51,315 --> 00:47:55,537
A few, sorry, a few takeaway concepts, generalities.

804
00:47:57,698 --> 00:48:02,161
On the concept side, I think having a clear vision for the game was absolutely critical for us.

805
00:48:02,961 --> 00:48:04,042
It informed what we made.

806
00:48:04,622 --> 00:48:07,364
It determined how people responded to the game after first hearing about it,

807
00:48:07,404 --> 00:48:09,025
because we'd worked on a good initial concept.

808
00:48:09,626 --> 00:48:14,689
And having that tight vision gave us this guidepost that just made the development flow.

809
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:20,273
On the development side, there are a lot of things to pick on, or to pick from.

810
00:48:20,293 --> 00:48:22,714
But probably the most important was...

811
00:48:24,093 --> 00:48:27,515
our attempts to more aggressively pursue simplicity and focus.

812
00:48:28,336 --> 00:48:31,697
Sort of trying to be more efficient about what we did meant simplifying things,

813
00:48:32,037 --> 00:48:34,459
cutting things, focusing on the most important elements.

814
00:48:35,219 --> 00:48:38,040
Which is scary, especially coming from retail, because in retail,

815
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,562
there's this kind of, there's this psychology which is like,

816
00:48:40,882 --> 00:48:42,843
in order to compete with other retail games,

817
00:48:43,423 --> 00:48:45,364
we have to just put more stuff in.

818
00:48:45,524 --> 00:48:48,966
It has to have this, it has to have online multiplayer, it has to have these things.

819
00:48:50,095 --> 00:48:50,155
uh...

820
00:48:50,596 --> 00:48:51,356
and what we kind of

821
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:55,937
slowly realizes that's totally wrong particularly for download only games

822
00:48:57,458 --> 00:49:00,539
and finally in the marketing just you know the term always on

823
00:49:01,559 --> 00:49:04,080
instead of doing something or doing something that we did at the end

824
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:07,801
it was something that we were always doing something we're having weekly

825
00:49:07,841 --> 00:49:08,461
meetings about

826
00:49:08,481 --> 00:49:10,982
that we took seriously throughout the entire development

827
00:49:14,103 --> 00:49:14,503
so that's it

828
00:49:25,903 --> 00:49:28,285
If you have any questions, yeah, I'd be happy to answer them.

829
00:49:28,305 --> 00:49:29,605
I think we have about 10 minutes.

830
00:49:30,746 --> 00:49:31,486
Yep.

831
00:49:31,687 --> 00:49:32,347
Thank you very much.

832
00:49:32,467 --> 00:49:33,187
Very inspiring.

833
00:49:33,588 --> 00:49:39,130
Just one question, if you can disclose any ballpark figures

834
00:49:39,271 --> 00:49:42,112
about the PR firm that you work with.

835
00:49:42,712 --> 00:49:45,154
In other words, if they worked on a

836
00:49:46,238 --> 00:49:49,779
fixed price or revenue share or things like that?

837
00:49:49,899 --> 00:49:50,799
Fixed price per month.

838
00:49:51,419 --> 00:49:53,660
And monthly fee, like a few thousand dollars a month.

839
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:54,760
A few thousand dollars a month.

840
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:55,821
OK, thank you.

841
00:49:59,582 --> 00:50:00,402
When I came to Seoul.

842
00:50:00,522 --> 00:50:01,942
No, go ahead.

843
00:50:03,423 --> 00:50:03,763
Thank you.

844
00:50:05,063 --> 00:50:09,405
Hi, I was wondering how long did the development took

845
00:50:09,705 --> 00:50:11,985
and how long did you originally estimate it?

846
00:50:13,419 --> 00:50:15,561
So the question is, how long was our development,

847
00:50:15,601 --> 00:50:16,902
and how long did we think the development

848
00:50:16,922 --> 00:50:18,223
was gonna take, initially?

849
00:50:19,223 --> 00:50:20,704
So yeah, the development was 19 months.

850
00:50:21,225 --> 00:50:23,366
Eight months pre-production, and then the rest production.

851
00:50:24,587 --> 00:50:25,808
How long did we think it was gonna take?

852
00:50:27,549 --> 00:50:28,830
We thought it was gonna take around that time.

853
00:50:29,370 --> 00:50:32,172
I think we basically figured,

854
00:50:32,192 --> 00:50:34,694
it's gonna take like a year and a half to two years,

855
00:50:35,094 --> 00:50:37,196
and then whatever our estimate is,

856
00:50:37,216 --> 00:50:38,577
let's add like six or eight months to that.

857
00:50:39,197 --> 00:50:39,998
That was kind of our attitude.

858
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:40,798
Thank you.

859
00:50:43,643 --> 00:50:48,325
When it came to selecting your PR firm, how many different firms did you look at?

860
00:50:48,385 --> 00:50:52,786
Do you have any advice for everyone for things to look out for or certain questions to ask?

861
00:50:55,807 --> 00:50:58,147
We interviewed a bunch, then we worked with one for a while,

862
00:50:59,327 --> 00:51:02,568
and then we ended up going with another one based on another recommendation.

863
00:51:06,755 --> 00:51:09,556
I wasn't that closely involved in the decision of the exact PR firm.

864
00:51:09,756 --> 00:51:14,079
I mean, we interviewed a few. We interviewed maybe five or six initially and get a feel and just sort of feel of like...

865
00:51:14,799 --> 00:51:21,703
Partly it was like, how connected are they to people and how much did they get the game and how much did they get the scene of the game?

866
00:51:21,803 --> 00:51:23,564
Those were kind of the things that we were looking for.

867
00:51:24,784 --> 00:51:28,626
And then when we made the switch, it was based on the vouch of somebody else who we knew.

868
00:51:28,646 --> 00:51:31,148
They were like, you know, you should totally talk to these guys because I think they're great.

869
00:51:31,568 --> 00:51:32,368
And I mean, that's kind of how...

870
00:51:33,262 --> 00:51:34,923
That's the world of work, right?

871
00:51:34,963 --> 00:51:37,564
Like, depressingly, mostly, you kind of get jobs

872
00:51:37,604 --> 00:51:38,505
because people vouch for you.

873
00:51:39,125 --> 00:51:41,366
And we're very happy with the people we went with

874
00:51:41,406 --> 00:51:42,126
for the vouch.

875
00:51:44,587 --> 00:51:47,009
I'm curious about, like, at the very beginning

876
00:51:47,029 --> 00:51:48,509
of pre-production, when you're trying to decide

877
00:51:48,569 --> 00:51:52,771
on the concept, the guacamole Mexican-inspired world

878
00:51:52,831 --> 00:51:53,411
and the brawler.

879
00:51:54,126 --> 00:51:58,009
You talked about like several founders that seem to probably have the most influence.

880
00:51:58,209 --> 00:52:02,512
I'm wondering what that process was like if there was someone who had their idea

881
00:52:02,572 --> 00:52:05,434
and they were really bummed that you were going with the Guacamelee idea

882
00:52:05,474 --> 00:52:08,536
and for months they were kind of pissed off and then they finally got on board

883
00:52:08,596 --> 00:52:11,798
because they saw how cool it was or was there anything like that happening?

884
00:52:12,178 --> 00:52:15,661
I think, you know, so there's there were sort of three key founders, myself and two other guys.

885
00:52:16,521 --> 00:52:18,723
And we all like the Guacamelee thing.

886
00:52:19,716 --> 00:52:22,337
But I had another idea and I was pissed off that we weren't going with my idea.

887
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:26,819
But I didn't get pissed off for very long,

888
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:30,181
because it's like, when the rest of the team obviously likes it,

889
00:52:30,321 --> 00:52:33,183
then what do you, you know, why are you holding on to your ego?

890
00:52:33,743 --> 00:52:36,764
And I think that's the thing with the three of us.

891
00:52:37,265 --> 00:52:39,906
We all have slightly different personalities, you know,

892
00:52:39,986 --> 00:52:41,987
and so then there's members on the team who are very,

893
00:52:42,127 --> 00:52:44,728
or of the three founders, there's like one guy who's the most ego-less.

894
00:52:45,974 --> 00:52:49,658
and sort of then because he's there and he's ego-less, it pushes your ego down.

895
00:52:49,918 --> 00:52:52,341
So you're like, you know, we need to be practical, we need to be honest.

896
00:52:53,062 --> 00:52:55,605
So yeah, so yeah, that kind of, that does happen.

897
00:52:55,866 --> 00:52:59,210
But at the end of the day, I mean, we kind of take the attitude of, you know,

898
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:04,356
if everybody likes it and I'm not so sure, then maybe I should be going with everybody.

899
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:21,424
A couple questions. Thanks for doing the talk by the way. First question, as far as playtesting and stuff, did you guys mostly just rely on yourselves and family and things like that? Or did you try to do outside sort of playtest scenarios?

900
00:53:22,144 --> 00:53:36,309
A lot of the early stuff was internal and then it would be family members. We actually did like a, we did a broader test through Steam. We put the game, we had like a Steam ID and we made it the beta available to a lot of people who we knew.

901
00:53:36,999 --> 00:53:38,900
and then we put metrics into the game

902
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:42,821
like we asked we had you know uh... surveys to give us information but then

903
00:53:42,861 --> 00:53:45,582
we had metrics in the game like where were they dying and what were they using

904
00:53:45,602 --> 00:53:47,563
the moves properly and where were they using them

905
00:53:48,143 --> 00:53:49,884
and we would have them send that stuff back to us

906
00:53:50,684 --> 00:53:52,865
uh... so we did kind of a broad one like that and then

907
00:53:53,745 --> 00:53:55,806
And then we did a lot near the end.

908
00:53:55,826 --> 00:53:58,267
You know, every few days we would have people come in

909
00:53:58,287 --> 00:54:03,688
and play in a room and we would stream the video to everyone,

910
00:54:03,908 --> 00:54:06,129
but in particular the designers could watch them play through

911
00:54:06,749 --> 00:54:08,290
because there would usually be arguments about,

912
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:09,970
this is too hard or this isn't too hard.

913
00:54:10,010 --> 00:54:12,531
And then you do the stream and then it's like,

914
00:54:12,831 --> 00:54:14,151
oh, okay, this is, yeah.

915
00:54:14,211 --> 00:54:16,552
So yeah, there was quite a bit of play testing,

916
00:54:16,612 --> 00:54:17,712
not as much as I would have liked,

917
00:54:18,273 --> 00:54:20,793
but there's never enough, but yeah, there was quite a lot.

918
00:54:21,256 --> 00:54:24,139
Okay, and just one other quick thing off the top of my head,

919
00:54:24,499 --> 00:54:28,403
difficulty as far as adding the two player component.

920
00:54:29,584 --> 00:54:32,847
How did you worry about adjusting difficulty?

921
00:54:32,907 --> 00:54:34,749
Or was it more of a thought, well,

922
00:54:35,069 --> 00:54:37,452
if playing two players it becomes just easier?

923
00:54:37,752 --> 00:54:40,615
Or do you consciously try to make it more difficult

924
00:54:40,655 --> 00:54:41,295
to balance it out?

925
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:43,357
Yeah, so yeah, the question is.

926
00:54:45,354 --> 00:54:48,238
adding two players, how did we handle that?

927
00:54:48,278 --> 00:54:49,259
Were we concerned about that?

928
00:54:50,201 --> 00:54:51,723
Yeah, we were extremely concerned about that.

929
00:54:52,143 --> 00:54:53,265
There was a person on the team

930
00:54:53,305 --> 00:54:54,607
who was pushing for two players,

931
00:54:55,328 --> 00:54:57,211
and we were doubtful because there was

932
00:54:57,231 --> 00:54:58,452
a lot of costs associated,

933
00:54:58,593 --> 00:55:01,036
and he finally kind of won us over.

934
00:55:03,058 --> 00:55:07,020
At a certain level, we kind of eventually accepted that the two-player game is going

935
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:12,243
to basically be easier, but also harder because of the dimension swapping with the platforming,

936
00:55:12,283 --> 00:55:16,866
which was kind of brutal to players, which is why we added this bubbling mechanic where

937
00:55:16,906 --> 00:55:17,847
the second player can bubble.

938
00:55:18,707 --> 00:55:23,190
We just kind of accepted that it was going to be easier, that it wasn't probably going

939
00:55:23,210 --> 00:55:24,871
to get a lot of use from people.

940
00:55:27,636 --> 00:55:32,260
and I mean there are adjustments that might not be obvious when you play, like basically the enemies become stronger.

941
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,482
But very simple adjustments. Basically our attitude was

942
00:55:36,843 --> 00:55:41,507
we played it, we had people play it, and we wanted to make sure that it flowed pretty well, but it wasn't our primary focus.

943
00:55:41,547 --> 00:55:43,829
We just wanted to make sure that it was reasonably good.

944
00:55:44,689 --> 00:55:45,590
That makes sense. Thank you.

945
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:47,211
Hi.

946
00:55:47,922 --> 00:55:53,504
During your presentation, you were talking about how you always said yes to adding new personality in your game.

947
00:55:54,284 --> 00:55:59,106
Did you ever feel that there were times where ideas were presented that didn't really fit your game,

948
00:55:59,146 --> 00:56:02,247
and how did you decide that those should not be a part of the guacamelee?

949
00:56:03,007 --> 00:56:08,709
Yeah, so to repeat the question, we added a lot of personality, and I said that we said yes to lots of stuff,

950
00:56:08,929 --> 00:56:12,030
but how do you mediate stuff that doesn't fit with the vision?

951
00:56:13,958 --> 00:56:15,759
Yeah, I'm not sure quite how to answer that.

952
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:17,721
I mean, the basic answer is,

953
00:56:18,201 --> 00:56:19,342
yes, we had problems with that,

954
00:56:19,843 --> 00:56:22,104
and the producer basically made the call.

955
00:56:22,645 --> 00:56:25,187
That was kind of the essence of it.

956
00:56:25,267 --> 00:56:27,509
I mean, that wasn't always true,

957
00:56:27,589 --> 00:56:28,790
because, you know, sometimes, like,

958
00:56:29,110 --> 00:56:30,571
say the producer wants to push something out,

959
00:56:30,631 --> 00:56:32,112
but then the team kind of revolts on it,

960
00:56:32,393 --> 00:56:34,154
and says, no, this must stay.

961
00:56:34,694 --> 00:56:35,715
And so the producer was...

962
00:56:36,876 --> 00:56:41,418
I kind of view the producer, it's like, kind of like the prime minister in a prime ministerial system.

963
00:56:41,458 --> 00:56:47,121
It's like the prime minister is the leader, and he's kind of in charge, and he gets to say what goes,

964
00:56:47,521 --> 00:56:50,382
but he's still subject to the other ministers.

965
00:56:50,422 --> 00:56:52,543
The other ministers can boot him out of the cabinet, right?

966
00:56:52,583 --> 00:56:54,884
They can kick him out if they really don't like what he's doing,

967
00:56:54,964 --> 00:56:56,565
and that's kind of the attitude we took with it.

968
00:56:56,605 --> 00:56:59,386
Like, the producer is in charge, and he's going to make the hard calls,

969
00:56:59,986 --> 00:57:04,808
but the people on the floor can still kind of revolt over it as a collective if they need to, if they feel they need to.

970
00:57:04,828 --> 00:57:06,009
All right, thank you.

971
00:57:11,531 --> 00:57:13,507
If nobody else has any questions, I'll ask my question.

972
00:57:14,945 --> 00:57:17,726
I am Lily. I'm the product manager at Toon Boom Animation.

973
00:57:18,206 --> 00:57:21,607
And I love the art style in your game.

974
00:57:21,647 --> 00:57:23,847
And I think that's one of the things that really sets it apart.

975
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:29,549
And I unfortunately was not able to attend the session that you guys had earlier about the art.

976
00:57:29,669 --> 00:57:31,130
But I just wanted to ask quickly,

977
00:57:32,190 --> 00:57:36,331
what was the pipeline that you used to get the artwork into your custom game engine?

978
00:57:36,491 --> 00:57:40,092
And were there any sort of, you know, problems that you're trying to address with that?

979
00:57:40,152 --> 00:57:42,973
We've just released a new version that exports to Unity seamlessly.

980
00:57:43,013 --> 00:57:44,293
But I'm kind of wondering what sort of...

981
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:47,223
challenges U-Fist in your pipeline?

982
00:57:47,283 --> 00:57:51,127
So all the environment art is done in 3D Studio with Photoshop.

983
00:57:51,567 --> 00:57:53,269
All the effects are done in the engine

984
00:57:54,130 --> 00:57:57,513
using this kind of shader stuff that's programmer-friendly.

985
00:57:58,094 --> 00:58:01,997
All the characters are drawn in Flash and exported to Swift.

986
00:58:03,059 --> 00:58:07,803
And then we have an importer in the engine that converts the Flash stuff to vector.

987
00:58:09,293 --> 00:58:10,413
uh... and then

988
00:58:10,873 --> 00:58:13,894
and it's done like that instead of like spreadsheets and stuff because it means

989
00:58:13,934 --> 00:58:14,595
we can get super

990
00:58:14,935 --> 00:58:16,815
we can get like sixty frames per second animation

991
00:58:17,156 --> 00:58:17,776
but the memory

992
00:58:18,096 --> 00:58:18,996
requirements are small

993
00:58:19,936 --> 00:58:23,338
uh... and i actually will say that uh... we actually started using Toon Boom

994
00:58:23,798 --> 00:58:24,158
as well

995
00:58:25,278 --> 00:58:26,579
and because it's a cool tool

996
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:29,040
and we're hoping to integrate that into our pipeline

997
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:33,041
because it seems to support many of the similar things that Flash does

998
00:58:33,365 --> 00:58:37,527
Yeah, and one of the things that I noticed also, you have a heavy use of textures and stuff,

999
00:58:37,567 --> 00:58:42,149
and one of the things I think that Flash and the Swift format is not very sort of friendly with

1000
00:58:42,229 --> 00:58:44,990
is the use of textures and textured lines and things like that.

1001
00:58:45,630 --> 00:58:47,851
Yeah, that's why mostly the characters do not contain textures.

1002
00:58:48,471 --> 00:58:51,872
They're basically just geometry, and then it's the environments that contain textures

1003
00:58:51,952 --> 00:58:54,113
because the environment artist is more comfortable...

1004
00:58:54,433 --> 00:58:57,354
Well, it makes more sense to do it in 3D Studio with proper textures.

1005
00:58:57,614 --> 00:58:59,035
Well, it looks beautiful. Good job.

1006
00:59:02,118 --> 00:59:03,356
Okay, well, thank you very much.
