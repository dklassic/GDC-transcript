00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:02,902
Woo! Got some traffic now that just came through.

2
00:00:02,902 --> 00:00:05,043
Hello everyone! Welcome to the GDC Twitch channel.

3
00:00:05,043 --> 00:00:06,544
My name is Bryant Francis.

4
00:00:06,544 --> 00:00:10,246
I am a contributing editor at GunwithFuture.com.

5
00:00:10,246 --> 00:00:11,867
I am the community manager for GDC.

6
00:00:11,867 --> 00:00:15,869
I am here today playing a game that I have been having a lot of fun with.

7
00:00:15,869 --> 00:00:17,610
The game is called The Outer Worlds.

8
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:21,632
It comes to us from Obsidian Entertainment and our friends at Private Division.

9
00:00:22,933 --> 00:00:29,757
This is a, not quite an open world RPG, but just kind of a, you know, it's an action RPG

10
00:00:29,757 --> 00:00:35,220
brought to you from a very talented studio down in Southern California, who are two members

11
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:39,202
of whom, two directors of whom are in the lower left hand corner of the screen.

12
00:00:39,202 --> 00:00:44,405
Before I introduce them, I need to introduce Alex, who I need to get his face back on camera

13
00:00:44,405 --> 00:00:44,705
a little.

14
00:00:44,705 --> 00:00:45,305
Alex, how you doing?

15
00:00:45,887 --> 00:00:49,869
You don't really need to. Hey, I'm Alex. I'm an editor for gamasutra.com and GDC.

16
00:00:49,869 --> 00:00:55,451
But I'm not that important. Who is important is our two special guests. Special guests,

17
00:00:55,451 --> 00:00:57,632
will you please tell everyone who you are and what you do?

18
00:00:57,632 --> 00:00:59,873
Go ahead, Tim.

19
00:00:59,873 --> 00:01:02,915
I'm Tim Cain. I was the co-director on Outer Worlds.

20
00:01:02,915 --> 00:01:06,876
I'm Leonard Bojarski. I was the other co-director.

21
00:01:06,876 --> 00:01:07,277
Right on.

22
00:01:07,277 --> 00:01:08,577
Nice.

23
00:01:08,577 --> 00:01:14,260
You guys have been doing RPGs for a while now, right? What number RPG is this?

24
00:01:18,553 --> 00:01:22,575
Are we counting Diablo as an action RPG or not?

25
00:01:22,575 --> 00:01:23,355
Sure. I count it. Yeah.

26
00:01:23,355 --> 00:01:26,297
Do you want to count MMORPGs?

27
00:01:26,297 --> 00:01:26,797
Absolutely.

28
00:01:26,797 --> 00:01:29,818
Stonekeep is an RPG, right?

29
00:01:29,818 --> 00:01:31,159
Tabletop also counts. 8. 7.

30
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:32,019
Stonekeep. Oh, God.

31
00:01:32,019 --> 00:01:37,942
A lot. I don't know. I've made like 7 or 8 games. I lost count.

32
00:01:37,942 --> 00:01:42,264
And that, that, does that include Stonekeep?

33
00:01:43,643 --> 00:01:46,365
Yeah, well, it's been a long day.

34
00:01:46,365 --> 00:01:47,265
It's been already.

35
00:01:47,265 --> 00:01:50,327
You know, I just see a lot of candy, a lot of them.

36
00:01:50,327 --> 00:01:52,629
The next 25 years worth or so.

37
00:01:52,629 --> 00:01:55,931
Yeah, I got to say real quick, happy holidays to everyone who marks

38
00:01:55,931 --> 00:01:57,152
Halloween as a special occasion.

39
00:01:57,152 --> 00:02:00,814
We are taking questions from chat today about game design, development

40
00:02:00,814 --> 00:02:02,456
and this game specifically.

41
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:04,997
So if you have questions for a letter, Tim, please throw them in chat

42
00:02:04,997 --> 00:02:08,179
and we will get them relayed with all haste.

43
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:10,441
I just kind of wonder how you guys are feeling.

44
00:02:10,441 --> 00:02:11,842
The game just came out.

45
00:02:11,842 --> 00:02:13,163
You're coming off a launch.

46
00:02:13,692 --> 00:02:14,773
How's everything going in the studio?

47
00:02:14,773 --> 00:02:15,253
Good.

48
00:02:15,253 --> 00:02:17,474
I'm feeling really good.

49
00:02:17,474 --> 00:02:21,115
It's nice to have people out there playing the game

50
00:02:21,115 --> 00:02:21,915
and enjoying it.

51
00:02:21,915 --> 00:02:24,336
You know, we've gotten a lot of great reviews,

52
00:02:24,336 --> 00:02:25,397
so that's always wonderful.

53
00:02:25,397 --> 00:02:28,158
You're never quite sure how people are gonna react

54
00:02:28,158 --> 00:02:28,838
to what you're doing.

55
00:02:28,838 --> 00:02:31,899
You get so close to it while you're developing it.

56
00:02:31,899 --> 00:02:33,840
They're laughing at the right time.

57
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,881
They're not laughing at the wrong things.

58
00:02:35,881 --> 00:02:36,181
Right.

59
00:02:36,181 --> 00:02:38,842
They seem to like the story and the characters

60
00:02:38,842 --> 00:02:42,143
and Moon Man, so check, check, check.

61
00:02:42,143 --> 00:02:43,203
All right.

62
00:02:43,452 --> 00:02:51,594
It's all green from here. Tell us a bit about how this project came to be and how you came to work together.

63
00:02:51,594 --> 00:02:52,754
This time,

64
00:02:52,754 --> 00:03:05,576
um, a few years ago, the founders asked if I was interested in making an IP and they had already talked about an idea for it. What I told them to pull it off. I would really need to have Leonard.

65
00:03:05,576 --> 00:03:12,357
I would not be able to do the story and in any way the characters without

66
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:18,434
his abilities. So they said, okay, and he was over at a little no name studio,

67
00:03:18,434 --> 00:03:25,316
Lizard, working on a project you've never heard of called Diablo. And he said, okay.

68
00:03:25,316 --> 00:03:35,700
Yes, it was such a great pitch. No, I, you know, the opportunity to make another IP from scratch

69
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:42,482
with Tim and, you know, return to my single player RPG roots was just too good to pass up.

70
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,222
Tim and I have a lot of fun when we're making stuff and it was just great to return to that.

71
00:03:48,222 --> 00:03:52,604
They literally put us in a room for three months. I think all we did is...

72
00:03:52,604 --> 00:03:55,785
Yeah, they wouldn't let us out. They just shoved the food in.

73
00:03:55,785 --> 00:03:59,846
So it was really fun to do that though. We hadn't done that in 10 years.

74
00:03:59,846 --> 00:04:01,247
Yeah, more than 10 years.

75
00:04:01,247 --> 00:04:05,368
Yeah, I kind of want to, you know, as Brian guides us through here,

76
00:04:05,368 --> 00:04:09,870
I kind of want to get your thoughts on where...

77
00:04:11,422 --> 00:04:15,024
RPG design development have gone in the past decade or plus like

78
00:04:15,024 --> 00:04:17,525
You know folks who don't know I mean if you can trace your work back

79
00:04:17,525 --> 00:04:24,630
You know through Diablo and all kinds of other stuff back to Troika back to Arcanum back to also under something all the way back to

80
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:29,092
You know stuff beyond that so I mean you've been doing this for well over a decade maybe two

81
00:04:29,092 --> 00:04:32,274
Like easily right because fallout was the 90s. So tell me like

82
00:04:34,077 --> 00:04:39,822
Sum it up succinctly the entire progression of last two decades of RPG design and development. How have you

83
00:04:39,822 --> 00:04:43,444
How have you seen it change? How are you feeling about it these days?

84
00:04:43,444 --> 00:04:51,210
Uh, there's this game that just came out called the outer worlds that we think is is a great representation of where rpg design is

85
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:57,375
No, seriously. I mean, I think that it's fantastic. You know when we first started making rpgs

86
00:04:57,375 --> 00:05:02,939
um way back in our play rpgs were still a viable thing in people's minds and then

87
00:05:03,578 --> 00:05:09,182
over the next decade or two people really weren't as interested in RPGs in the mainstream. I mean,

88
00:05:09,182 --> 00:05:15,547
there's always, you know, the people who loved RPGs, but the mainstream of games seem to have

89
00:05:15,547 --> 00:05:20,711
moved away from that. And then, you know, you get like your massively multiplayer RPGs, which

90
00:05:20,711 --> 00:05:26,456
whether they're actual RPGs or not is open to debate, but I think that some of that and then,

91
00:05:26,456 --> 00:05:28,417
you know, games like Diablo really kind of...

92
00:05:28,987 --> 00:05:29,508
sparked a

93
00:05:29,508 --> 00:05:33,771
Resurgence of that and then you have you know your mass effects

94
00:05:33,771 --> 00:05:38,014
Which are very interesting. I mean, I thought that what they did with mass effect was really cool

95
00:05:38,014 --> 00:05:40,096
I think the witcher is really cool

96
00:05:40,096 --> 00:05:45,920
But we just felt like there was a lack of games where you had the blank slate character. That was really

97
00:05:46,858 --> 00:05:49,719
Generated from scratch by the player

98
00:05:49,719 --> 00:05:52,681
We felt like that hadn't really moved forward

99
00:05:52,681 --> 00:05:55,902
As much as all the other aspects of RPGs had you know

100
00:05:55,902 --> 00:06:00,124
We never except for vampires about to say we never got the opportunity to do first-person RPG

101
00:06:00,124 --> 00:06:04,647
We did that with vampire wasn't as successful as we would have liked at the time

102
00:06:04,647 --> 00:06:10,910
People seem to like it now, but I think that was one of the biggest things was having actual RPGs in first-person

103
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:15,952
But then it seems to it seems like you know the stuff that we love to do the blank slate characters

104
00:06:16,152 --> 00:06:20,175
the really focusing on player role-playing of however they want to role-play

105
00:06:20,175 --> 00:06:24,757
and the reaction to their choices seemed to be the things that people weren't

106
00:06:24,757 --> 00:06:27,519
focusing as much on as that we wanted to focus on.

107
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:31,561
I think too that RPGs used to be heavily influenced by tabletop

108
00:06:31,561 --> 00:06:37,125
and I think computer RPGs are finally moving, becoming their own thing.

109
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:42,288
You don't have to be a D&D RPG to get a lot of people interested in your game.

110
00:06:43,377 --> 00:06:51,069
or GURPS or any of the other Pathfinder, I mean those make great RPGs too, great CRPGs,

111
00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:55,736
but I think RPGs, computer RPGs are now becoming like their own thing.

112
00:06:55,736 --> 00:06:56,177
Yeah, I wonder if-

113
00:06:56,688 --> 00:06:57,969
Go ahead, please.

114
00:06:57,969 --> 00:07:01,951
I was just going to say, in the fact that people are excited about this,

115
00:07:01,951 --> 00:07:04,893
this type of RPG and are reacting so well to the, you know,

116
00:07:04,893 --> 00:07:07,315
the stuff that we've always loved to do is just really nice

117
00:07:07,315 --> 00:07:10,377
because there was a time where, you know, you go to a publisher

118
00:07:10,377 --> 00:07:14,399
and try to pitch them on making a game that had a lot of, you know, depth

119
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:15,640
and story and choices.

120
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:19,002
And they just kind of give you a blank look and try to steer

121
00:07:19,002 --> 00:07:23,125
more towards multiplayer or more towards an action game.

122
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:23,885
Yeah, I am.

123
00:07:24,327 --> 00:07:28,310
It seems like people, anecdotally, people seem much more excited and passionate.

124
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,110
I mean this in the best way.

125
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:32,693
They mean much more excited and passionate about this game than they are about something like

126
00:07:32,693 --> 00:07:35,274
tyranny or something, which I also really, really enjoyed

127
00:07:35,274 --> 00:07:37,576
and felt like it could have gotten a lot more attention.

128
00:07:37,576 --> 00:07:40,878
I'm curious, why do you think a game like this seems to be hitting so well now,

129
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:45,061
as opposed to some of other, I'd not say Obsidian stuff hasn't done well,

130
00:07:45,061 --> 00:07:47,462
but there is it feels like the outer world has broken through

131
00:07:47,462 --> 00:07:50,504
into a larger audience than Obsidian games typically do.

132
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:51,825
I wonder if that matches up with your own.

133
00:07:52,481 --> 00:07:58,046
observations from inside the studio and if so why I

134
00:07:58,046 --> 00:08:06,093
Think well the reason I think that's happened is one. There's not really anything out like this right now, and so I think

135
00:08:06,093 --> 00:08:06,614
We kind of

136
00:08:06,614 --> 00:08:07,395
Hit a good time to

137
00:08:07,395 --> 00:08:13,961
Product something like this and also one of the very one of our early pillars that we decided on was we wanted to make this

138
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:14,902
Game easy to get

139
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:20,033
a lot of RPGs and our RPGs in the past had this. The very first thing you were

140
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:24,496
hit with is a ton of numbers, a ton of stuff you had to read in order to get in the game.

141
00:08:24,496 --> 00:08:28,999
And this one we said let's try to move as much of character creation out of

142
00:08:28,999 --> 00:08:34,823
character creation. Let them spend skill points later. Let them, you know, let perks

143
00:08:34,823 --> 00:08:35,823
come later.

144
00:08:39,056 --> 00:08:41,898
and dive into the game so you can start playing.

145
00:08:41,898 --> 00:08:42,938
And I think that just appeals,

146
00:08:42,938 --> 00:08:46,060
I think that gets more casual players,

147
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,062
but I think that still appeals to hardcore players.

148
00:08:48,062 --> 00:08:49,502
They have their depth, it just comes later.

149
00:08:49,502 --> 00:08:52,084
And I also think it has to do with the first person view.

150
00:08:52,084 --> 00:08:56,187
You know, I think people look at a isometric game

151
00:08:56,187 --> 00:08:59,349
and just really, you know, if you're not into RPGs,

152
00:08:59,349 --> 00:09:02,170
I think people kind of like just back off immediately.

153
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:03,331
Whether or not it's true,

154
00:09:03,331 --> 00:09:05,152
they assume there's just so much.

155
00:09:05,934 --> 00:09:11,320
complexity and depth that they just don't want to have to deal with up front which again goes to how we want to kind of

156
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,881
ease people into

157
00:09:12,881 --> 00:09:17,647
Making more and more choices about their character as opposed to trying to figure out, you know

158
00:09:17,647 --> 00:09:19,769
um, I always use this example because

159
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:21,291
Because we didn't fall you know

160
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,914
If I put points into this energy weapon, am I going to be able to find?

161
00:09:24,154 --> 00:09:30,037
You know energy weapons before you know halfway through the game and in fall the answer was no

162
00:09:30,037 --> 00:09:35,079
So, you know with the categories that Tim and Charlie our lead designer came up with

163
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:40,221
I thought that was a fantastic solution where I don't have to decide I'm being a range character

164
00:09:40,221 --> 00:09:44,563
I put points into the category and I think people really responded well to that because it's

165
00:09:45,337 --> 00:09:51,918
By the time you have to start making your specialization choices, you understand what the game is and you kind of understand what you would want to get into more.

166
00:09:51,918 --> 00:09:57,100
That's why I liked having worked with Leonard for so long, because we could literally have a conversation where I'd start,

167
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,941
Hey, you know that stupid thing we did in one of our games? Let's not do it in this game.

168
00:10:00,941 --> 00:10:04,621
That was our to do list. Don't do our stupid things we've done before.

169
00:10:04,621 --> 00:10:09,003
Yeah, well, let's let's focus in for a second and talk specifically about that leveling system.

170
00:10:09,003 --> 00:10:12,483
I don't know how hands on either of you were with this, but for folks who haven't played it yet.

171
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:18,616
It's a RPG-loving system where people can put points into skill groups up to a certain point.

172
00:10:18,616 --> 00:10:22,357
And after a certain point, those points will go across all skills in the group.

173
00:10:22,357 --> 00:10:27,599
So you'll get one point in all three, up to 50, and then you have to put in points on a one-to-one basis.

174
00:10:27,599 --> 00:10:31,120
I'm curious, I've never seen that, as minor a change as it is.

175
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,461
I've never seen anything like that in a PC game before.

176
00:10:33,461 --> 00:10:36,702
So tell me, how did that process, how did that system get designed?

177
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:38,143
How did you come up with it?

178
00:10:38,143 --> 00:10:41,444
Well, I'd already had the categories in the game.

179
00:10:42,203 --> 00:10:43,824
where you had, and it always started with you just tag two,

180
00:10:43,824 --> 00:10:45,105
because I'm like, you don't really,

181
00:10:45,105 --> 00:10:46,526
I don't want them to have to think too much

182
00:10:46,526 --> 00:10:49,108
at the beginning about what they want to do.

183
00:10:49,108 --> 00:10:51,749
I'm just interested in this and this.

184
00:10:51,749 --> 00:10:54,030
And I think it was our creative director, Josh Sawyer,

185
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:56,752
said, hey, that's gonna really make people

186
00:10:56,752 --> 00:10:57,733
want to specialize.

187
00:10:57,733 --> 00:10:59,534
It's kind of penalizing to generalists.

188
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:01,915
And so I redesigned it so that the points

189
00:11:01,915 --> 00:11:03,056
you put in the categories.

190
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:10,492
spread out to all the skills in that category at the beginning and suddenly what we had was a game where I don't have to

191
00:11:10,492 --> 00:11:12,533
Think about anything other than I like using

192
00:11:12,533 --> 00:11:19,156
Guns it doesn't matter whether I like using handguns or rifles or heavy weapons

193
00:11:19,156 --> 00:11:23,838
I just like guns and that's all you have to think about for anywhere from five to ten levels

194
00:11:23,838 --> 00:11:30,140
And then later on you know what's cool about that is that you try all the guns that appear in the game

195
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:38,106
And we don't have to drop all the guns immediately because no matter what gun we drop, you're going to be pretty good at it.

196
00:11:38,106 --> 00:11:42,790
And then you can play with different guns for a few levels and on different maps and different creatures and go,

197
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,512
I really like machine guns.

198
00:11:44,512 --> 00:11:48,556
And then so by the time you realize that, you can start putting points directly into heavy weapons.

199
00:11:48,556 --> 00:11:50,858
And that applied to all the skill categories.

200
00:11:50,858 --> 00:11:53,280
You could play with different dialogue skills and say,

201
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,363
I really feel bad when I lie to people, but I love intimidating them.

202
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:04,454
Boom. Put all your points into intimidation.

203
00:12:13,784 --> 00:12:19,647
for the character building side as opposed to the people who just want interesting choices to make.

204
00:12:19,647 --> 00:12:23,608
I'm going to pause for a minute and give a quick shout out to chat and apologies for some mild

205
00:12:23,608 --> 00:12:28,510
technical difficulties I've been trying to solve at my end. For you folks out there in chat we have

206
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:33,433
folks like Big Crazy Wolf who are so happy, they want to say thank you guys for this game,

207
00:12:33,433 --> 00:12:38,095
they absolutely love it. I've been asked by VRaptor64

208
00:12:38,135 --> 00:12:42,477
To just do the secret people request the stream. So it's what I'm gonna work on

209
00:12:42,477 --> 00:12:46,899
Disclosure the Raptor is friend of the show Carly who is apparently watching me over there

210
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:52,481
But yeah, other than that, we are taking your questions

211
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:56,223
We would like the questions to be focused on game development if you could

212
00:12:56,223 --> 00:13:02,606
I'm dealing with some mild controller issues that were not happening earlier. So I will work on fixing those

213
00:13:02,606 --> 00:13:06,948
Alex do you have any questions for our guest? I have so many you guys. Thank you so much for

214
00:13:07,473 --> 00:13:09,354
Giving us a full hour.

215
00:13:09,354 --> 00:13:13,015
Yeah, so I really feel that this game does some interesting work

216
00:13:13,015 --> 00:13:15,316
to sort of, and as you just said, to sort of streamline

217
00:13:15,316 --> 00:13:16,957
the process of getting into it and sort of make

218
00:13:16,957 --> 00:13:19,838
the ramp into the mid-game very gentle.

219
00:13:19,838 --> 00:13:21,939
I'm curious to know, is there anything

220
00:13:21,939 --> 00:13:23,960
you felt like you had to sacrifice or give up on,

221
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,302
either specifically to sort of design

222
00:13:27,302 --> 00:13:28,842
this sort of opening couple of hours,

223
00:13:28,842 --> 00:13:31,183
or just in general that you sort of regret?

224
00:13:34,993 --> 00:13:41,659
Not I don't think in the way you're you're thinking about we did have to make there's two rounds of cuts

225
00:13:41,659 --> 00:13:44,161
We had to make in the game for content

226
00:13:44,161 --> 00:13:51,087
For scope so that we could finish the game and make sure it was as polished as it is. So that was very tough

227
00:13:51,087 --> 00:13:52,508
But that was that was just content

228
00:13:52,508 --> 00:13:57,772
I don't I don't believe I don't feel like we made compromises or cuts at the very beginning to get players into it

229
00:13:57,772 --> 00:13:59,874
You know as Tim was saying, you know Josh

230
00:14:00,195 --> 00:14:04,571
Sawyer's the design director at the company and he worked on

231
00:14:05,701 --> 00:14:08,483
New Vegas, along with a lot of other people on our team.

232
00:14:08,483 --> 00:14:15,668
And what they had done was to make sure that in the very first area of the game,

233
00:14:15,668 --> 00:14:18,390
they had a lot of skill checks all over the place.

234
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,632
So he was mentioning that to us, and we were like,

235
00:14:20,632 --> 00:14:23,154
you know, that's a really good thing to keep in mind.

236
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:26,637
So we just really wanted to give players a lot of feedback early on

237
00:14:26,637 --> 00:14:30,419
that all of their choices were mattering.

238
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:39,766
And also, you know, just having people like him or other people who have worked on games but aren't working on this game currently, or weren't working on this game currently, around,

239
00:14:39,766 --> 00:14:44,750
it's fantastic to have RPG developers that you can have play your game who aren't as close to it as you are.

240
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:49,854
Because you get so close to this stuff, you're not quite sure if it's landing or not.

241
00:14:51,243 --> 00:14:57,627
I mean, I've been telling other people, before we shipped, I finished this game 16 times.

242
00:14:57,627 --> 00:14:58,828
With wildly different characters.

243
00:14:58,828 --> 00:15:02,951
I was still finding new stuff in the last playthrough.

244
00:15:02,951 --> 00:15:04,452
And then after we shipped...

245
00:15:04,805 --> 00:15:11,548
Was watching a streamer play and he found something in Edgewater. I'd never found before and like other than this that was that

246
00:15:11,548 --> 00:15:13,829
There's a grave that's all by itself

247
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:20,753
Oh that one way to the beach and it's because we changed that area several times and I got back after the final change

248
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,713
But still the fact that I'd never I knew there was a POI down there

249
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:23,054
Right

250
00:15:23,054 --> 00:15:30,737
I really want to get into writing about all this too. But before we do that's a great point

251
00:15:30,737 --> 00:15:32,078
I want to jump into how did you?

252
00:15:32,772 --> 00:15:38,373
How does the studio set up a production workflow so that you can produce?

253
00:15:38,373 --> 00:15:42,554
Sure, how do you like I'm going to fix this controller problem?

254
00:15:42,554 --> 00:15:48,115
No worries. There's a ton of stuff in this game. It's big. It's open, you know, it's a sizable

255
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:56,577
endeavor. How does the studio effectively produce the assets for a game like this? Because it sounds

256
00:15:56,577 --> 00:15:59,418
hard. It is really hard. Yeah.

257
00:15:59,418 --> 00:16:00,878
Um, like coordination?

258
00:16:02,105 --> 00:16:06,368
Yeah, I think there's a lot of planning involved. There's a lot of coordination.

259
00:16:06,368 --> 00:16:11,091
You wouldn't believe how many things slip through the cracks and we're scrambling.

260
00:16:11,091 --> 00:16:13,152
Like, how did we miss that?

261
00:16:13,152 --> 00:16:18,916
It's a lot less organized than it probably should be or than people would expect it to be.

262
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:22,339
We had amazing QA, which is not a bar. We don't have a lot of bugs.

263
00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:24,901
But they tested this game so many different ways.

264
00:16:25,641 --> 00:16:29,404
And just a lot of very talented developers, you know, keeping track of things.

265
00:16:29,404 --> 00:16:32,466
I mean, we make very detailed design docs.

266
00:16:32,466 --> 00:16:36,749
We try to keep them living to be living documents so they don't just sit there.

267
00:16:36,749 --> 00:16:39,490
But after a while, it's, you know, it's it's almost as much work

268
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:42,492
to keep up the docs as it is to just develop the game.

269
00:16:42,492 --> 00:16:45,574
So we really rely on people who are working on their areas

270
00:16:45,574 --> 00:16:49,237
to take ownership of that and make sure they're getting what they need

271
00:16:49,237 --> 00:16:51,418
and that the docs are if the docs aren't up to date,

272
00:16:51,418 --> 00:16:53,360
that they're communicating with the other departments.

273
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:58,966
And then of course our producers, you know, I don't think the producers get enough of enough credit on a game like this

274
00:16:58,966 --> 00:17:04,672
We had a fantastic production team and they were they were doing a lot of the work of keeping track of everything

275
00:17:04,672 --> 00:17:10,459
Everybody needed and making sure it was being worked on when it needed to be worked on. Yeah

276
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:13,923
That occurs me you meant you shouted out QA which is fantastic. I gotta say, you know, I put

277
00:17:14,345 --> 00:17:17,606
you know, maybe 10, 20 hours in this game and it's, uh, it's very,

278
00:17:17,606 --> 00:17:20,728
it's very stable. It's very, uh, it's bulletproof as far as I can tell. Um,

279
00:17:20,728 --> 00:17:24,750
and there has been times in the past when obsidian has gotten a lot of like,

280
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:29,073
uh, like critical lampooning for perhaps launching with buggy games. Um,

281
00:17:29,073 --> 00:17:32,534
I don't know how much of that is due to a number of causes, whether it's, uh,

282
00:17:32,534 --> 00:17:32,915
you know,

283
00:17:32,915 --> 00:17:36,837
just the scope of the games or the production process or the time involved or

284
00:17:36,837 --> 00:17:38,878
whatever. Um, but I'm curious, like, uh,

285
00:17:39,441 --> 00:17:45,954
How has the studio's approach to QA and how has your observation of the studio's approach to QA changed over the last couple of years?

286
00:17:45,954 --> 00:17:51,325
And was there anything new put into place on this game that maybe was done to make it just extra bulletproof?

287
00:17:51,998 --> 00:17:59,243
One thing I tried to do early, as early as I could, was I wrote up all the playthrough paths that I wanted supported.

288
00:17:59,243 --> 00:18:04,446
And on a game like this, I didn't try to do every single one because that's hard, but I tried to do major ones like

289
00:18:04,446 --> 00:18:09,329
make a character that fights mainly with guns, do one with melee.

290
00:18:09,329 --> 00:18:11,731
Make a character that uses all the science weapons.

291
00:18:11,731 --> 00:18:14,613
Make a character that tinkers everything.

292
00:18:14,613 --> 00:18:16,734
One of them was a dumb character.

293
00:18:16,734 --> 00:18:19,476
One of them I said, make a character that kills everybody.

294
00:18:19,856 --> 00:18:23,361
Everybody you run across, kill them, hopefully before they even talk to you.

295
00:18:23,361 --> 00:18:27,327
And of course, I'm sure QA had a lot of fun with that one.

296
00:18:27,327 --> 00:18:30,411
But that actually tested a lot of things in the game about...

297
00:18:31,177 --> 00:18:33,638
can quests continue without a quest giver?

298
00:18:33,638 --> 00:18:40,521
What happens when people make particular weapons way outside the level range we're expecting for Xenon?

299
00:18:40,521 --> 00:18:44,343
What happens when people go in with wildly different skill sets

300
00:18:44,343 --> 00:18:47,464
and yet they still have to be able to finish a particular quest?

301
00:18:47,464 --> 00:18:50,025
And we got a lot of feedback from QA and that helped us fix a lot of quests

302
00:18:50,025 --> 00:18:55,328
and other content in the game to make it viable for every different kind of character.

303
00:18:55,328 --> 00:18:58,629
I think the biggest thing overall that we did differently was...

304
00:18:59,475 --> 00:19:05,479
In the past, we wouldn't make those choices until we had to, to make cuts.

305
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:08,961
I mean, and we were pretty much at a place where we had to in this one,

306
00:19:08,961 --> 00:19:13,164
but we just realized it a lot sooner or faced up to the fact a lot sooner.

307
00:19:13,164 --> 00:19:16,326
Because before we're just like, no, we want this content in there for the players.

308
00:19:16,326 --> 00:19:19,949
The game is going to suffer without this, without this content in there.

309
00:19:19,949 --> 00:19:21,690
We have to make sure it's in there.

310
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:24,492
So that means you're, you're, you're developing the game.

311
00:19:25,132 --> 00:19:28,635
way further into the beta than you should be.

312
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:31,477
You know, you shouldn't be developing really seriously past alpha.

313
00:19:31,477 --> 00:19:35,940
You know, we always end up pushing that, but you know, you want a really good

314
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,602
beta period where the game is playable from beginning to end,

315
00:19:38,602 --> 00:19:40,943
all the content's in there, and you know...

316
00:19:41,868 --> 00:19:45,731
A lot of times we were just so passionate about what we were doing in the past that we wouldn't

317
00:19:45,731 --> 00:19:51,597
make those cuts and this time we forced ourselves to make those tough choices earlier than we had

318
00:19:51,597 --> 00:19:56,081
before and that enabled Tim to play the game 17 times instead of developing the game.

319
00:19:56,081 --> 00:19:59,764
There's other things we decided early like putting a dumb

320
00:20:00,139 --> 00:20:02,880
dumb character lines in was something we said right from the beginning.

321
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,622
So it's like every time a writer came on board we're like you have to support dumb

322
00:20:07,622 --> 00:20:12,863
player characters. You know, don't resist, just give in now and write those lines. And I think

323
00:20:12,863 --> 00:20:17,505
they wrote some great stuff. Sure. I want to jump in a chat here and not let everybody go

324
00:20:17,505 --> 00:20:23,006
unnoticed. Big Crazy Wolf asked the question, basically has the response to the game been what

325
00:20:23,006 --> 00:20:25,027
you hoped for? Better or worse?

326
00:20:27,188 --> 00:20:31,194
It's it's definitely what we hope for I mean, it's it's a lot better

327
00:20:31,194 --> 00:20:36,463
Than than we were expecting because you always see the flaws you always see you're so close to the game

328
00:20:36,463 --> 00:20:39,147
You see the game that you wanted to make

329
00:20:39,668 --> 00:20:42,229
of when you started it, and you only see the places...

330
00:20:42,229 --> 00:20:46,170
I mean, there was a lot of stuff to be proud of, don't get me wrong, I was very happy with the game,

331
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:50,972
but all I could see was, you know, the bigger game that I had originally envisioned,

332
00:20:50,972 --> 00:20:56,234
and, you know, having to make the smaller game, having to, you know, make some of those tough cuts,

333
00:20:56,234 --> 00:21:00,595
not having some of the depth that I was hoping was going to be there originally,

334
00:21:00,595 --> 00:21:02,896
was a little bit hard to see past.

335
00:21:02,896 --> 00:21:03,596
And, you know, when we...

336
00:21:04,337 --> 00:21:07,580
We got people playing the game earlier, you know, we had a

337
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:14,726
E3 we had a very successful E3 and they if there's a judges day where the judges played it and they were all really enthusiastic

338
00:21:14,726 --> 00:21:15,987
About it

339
00:21:15,987 --> 00:21:20,010
It's kind of like at least I was a little bit in denial like every time I heard somebody had fun

340
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:23,633
I'm like, oh they must not have gotten to this part or this other part, you know

341
00:21:23,633 --> 00:21:27,757
It wasn't until I saw you know, all the great feedback that I finally go. Okay. Yeah

342
00:21:27,757 --> 00:21:32,441
I'm being a little bit too hard on some of the stuff and start accepting that people are having a great time

343
00:21:33,617 --> 00:21:36,401
Right on. Did it exceed your expectations?

344
00:21:36,401 --> 00:21:42,048
Yeah, one thing I love is when I'm reading reviews, especially when I watch streamers or watch video reviews,

345
00:21:42,048 --> 00:21:47,674
there's so many details in the game. I'm so glad that people are finding

346
00:21:47,674 --> 00:21:52,000
like fun ways of interacting with NPCs or side quests that they didn't know existed or even...

347
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,745
I love it when people think, I'm going to do this really weird thing to solve this quest.

348
00:21:56,745 --> 00:22:01,971
And then they discover, we thought of that, the NPC has a response to what you just did.

349
00:22:01,971 --> 00:22:05,715
And I love that they're finding these things because it's like,

350
00:22:05,715 --> 00:22:09,158
we wanted to make this world that we described as wide.

351
00:22:09,158 --> 00:22:11,501
People always talk about, how long is the game?

352
00:22:11,501 --> 00:22:13,163
I'm like, let's talk again about how wide it is.

353
00:22:13,163 --> 00:22:14,104
Because it's a very wide game.

354
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,462
Yeah, it's um, let's talk about the writing. Let's dig right into I know there was uh,

355
00:22:19,462 --> 00:22:23,685
There's a full writing team, but uh, you guys certainly had your hand in it and I want to talk about

356
00:22:23,685 --> 00:22:24,185
um

357
00:22:24,185 --> 00:22:29,488
sort of like the general thrust of of what you were trying to accomplish with the writing in this game and the narratives

358
00:22:29,488 --> 00:22:33,410
and um sort of just like uh, how do you write

359
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:38,053
How do you write a funny game? Honestly, because like I have found that many funny games

360
00:22:38,581 --> 00:22:41,403
that purport to be amusing are actually really tricky to get into and

361
00:22:41,403 --> 00:22:46,266
Especially the opening of this game the comedic timing and the writing it like really lands for me

362
00:22:46,266 --> 00:22:51,329
And I don't see that in games very often. So like how how did you approach structuring and writing that kind of stuff?

363
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:54,491
well, the humor was was

364
00:22:55,169 --> 00:22:59,312
the same kind of humor me and Tim always like to put in our games.

365
00:22:59,312 --> 00:23:03,115
It's a combination of my dark worldview and Tim's silly worldview.

366
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:07,918
So that part, at least knowing what we wanted it to be, was I think half the battle.

367
00:23:07,918 --> 00:23:10,900
And we already had done that several times before.

368
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,962
So I think that started us out a little bit ahead of the game.

369
00:23:13,962 --> 00:23:17,665
But I think for me, when I was, you know, instructing the writers on what we wanted,

370
00:23:19,504 --> 00:23:25,471
Yeah, we wanted humor. We wanted to make sure that there was, you know, enough humor in it.

371
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:31,758
But at the same time, it always had to come from situations that had to come from characterization.

372
00:23:31,758 --> 00:23:37,725
It had to come from the absurdity of the world, like people trying to live their lives and

373
00:23:38,112 --> 00:23:45,982
and justify to themselves how they could, you know, how they could live and make the choices

374
00:23:45,982 --> 00:23:51,550
they were in this absurd situation, as opposed to just trying to find funny jokes. If you create...

375
00:23:52,819 --> 00:23:56,962
absurdity in the situations and depth in the characters,

376
00:23:56,962 --> 00:24:02,446
just them reacting to it in an honest way is going to create a lot of that for you.

377
00:24:02,446 --> 00:24:04,548
And just, you know, that's not to say we don't have, you know,

378
00:24:04,548 --> 00:24:07,470
awesomely talented writers, because we do,

379
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:12,293
but once those things are all in place, I think it's easier for them to kind of...

380
00:24:13,174 --> 00:24:16,975
get the humor in there. Because Tim would play an area and say, oh this area is too dry,

381
00:24:16,975 --> 00:24:21,958
and the writers would make another pass on it, and it wasn't like a torturous process or anything.

382
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:26,720
The raw material was already there for them to kind of exploit to make more humorous.

383
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,882
But as Leonard pointed out, Leonard's the reason this game isn't goofy,

384
00:24:30,882 --> 00:24:32,783
and I'm the reason it's not depressing.

385
00:24:33,532 --> 00:24:39,120
I like pointing out that it's not depressing, because there's sort of a way that like,

386
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,827
especially for a total of this game, which it harkens back to Fallout, it harkens back to,

387
00:24:43,827 --> 00:24:49,094
you know, a cynical outlook about what will happen in the future.

388
00:24:49,094 --> 00:24:50,156
That's me.

389
00:24:50,797 --> 00:24:55,802
It's still, I've seen some really interesting takes from people who've played the game,

390
00:24:55,802 --> 00:24:58,985
especially about the first major choice you have to make, which, we're pretty deep in

391
00:24:58,985 --> 00:25:02,949
the game, but I won't go shouting spoilers in case anyone's new.

392
00:25:02,949 --> 00:25:08,014
For the pair of you I'd like to know, it was really cool, I got to see Kari Patel give

393
00:25:08,014 --> 00:25:12,359
a GDC talk last year about working with the dialogue tools that your company works with.

394
00:25:12,779 --> 00:25:17,721
Obsidian has been working with a really similar tool set for several years now.

395
00:25:17,721 --> 00:25:19,582
Even as it's been making different kinds of games.

396
00:25:19,582 --> 00:25:26,944
It's been making Infinity Engine, Tribute RPGs, it's been making, you know, The Stick of Truth, the South Park game.

397
00:25:26,944 --> 00:25:31,306
And now it's come out and made something that's kind of a modern Fallout-like, I guess?

398
00:25:31,306 --> 00:25:35,467
You guys worked on Obsidian Produced New Vegas, so it's fair to say that.

399
00:25:35,847 --> 00:25:41,509
Um, uh, how has it been, obviously as game directors, like sort of keeping up your toolset

400
00:25:41,509 --> 00:25:48,032
to make very similar games, even though you had to change, like, major, major genre changes several

401
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:50,873
times? Well, this is the first game I've

402
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:54,685
worked on at Obsidian, so I don't have a lot of history,

403
00:25:54,685 --> 00:25:57,246
except for the history I had with the people

404
00:25:57,246 --> 00:25:59,967
back when we were all at Interplay.

405
00:25:59,967 --> 00:26:02,988
And when we were at Troika, we used Excel.

406
00:26:02,988 --> 00:26:05,889
So it really wouldn't be hard to clear that bar

407
00:26:05,889 --> 00:26:06,930
for a dialogue tool.

408
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:15,633
But I just have to say that the dialogue tool and the quest tool and the different tools that they've developed over the years here at obsidian are just fantastic.

409
00:26:15,633 --> 00:26:25,417
You know, the dialogue and quest tool are big visual flow charts, so you can see how the conversation flows, which is, you know.

410
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:30,942
an enormous help with the kind of complexity that we're putting into this these kind of games.

411
00:26:30,942 --> 00:26:36,025
But you know they've been developing it I'm assuming since since they started as a company.

412
00:26:36,025 --> 00:26:38,587
Oh yeah 16 years in development on those tools.

413
00:26:38,587 --> 00:26:42,049
And it shows it's it's it's a fantastic dialogue tool.

414
00:26:42,049 --> 00:26:45,591
Yeah I've been here for eight years and we use the same tools on South Park.

415
00:26:45,952 --> 00:26:50,015
and Pillars of Eternity and Tyranny and Outer Worlds.

416
00:26:50,015 --> 00:26:54,898
And because of that, people can move from project to project

417
00:26:54,898 --> 00:26:57,860
and you're already familiar with those tools.

418
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:00,962
They just get improved every cycle.

419
00:27:00,962 --> 00:27:04,143
So we hit the ground running with those.

420
00:27:04,143 --> 00:27:04,404
Nice.

421
00:27:04,404 --> 00:27:06,425
Real quick, just for my own edification,

422
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:08,346
what engine is this game built in?

423
00:27:08,346 --> 00:27:11,488
I don't think I've ever actually looked at it.

424
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,208
Is this...

425
00:27:12,208 --> 00:27:13,189
What tools is this built in?

426
00:27:13,915 --> 00:27:15,296
This is a real four.

427
00:27:15,296 --> 00:27:17,097
OK, yeah. All right.

428
00:27:17,097 --> 00:27:19,298
Cool. That's I was just curious.

429
00:27:19,298 --> 00:27:23,161
So let's talk a bit about

430
00:27:23,161 --> 00:27:25,702
how you build games that reward player choice, right?

431
00:27:25,702 --> 00:27:30,425
Because like this game seems so much about giving players many options.

432
00:27:30,425 --> 00:27:31,305
You know, it's very wide.

433
00:27:31,305 --> 00:27:35,248
How do you think about the way you structure choices?

434
00:27:35,248 --> 00:27:36,688
Like I have to assume it's not just always.

435
00:27:37,032 --> 00:27:41,774
Every zone has good, bad, you know, and then third option.

436
00:27:41,774 --> 00:27:45,836
Is there a structure or any kind of like process you go through to build these

437
00:27:45,836 --> 00:27:46,876
out? These narrow structures,

438
00:27:46,876 --> 00:27:51,218
we're all just kind of writers rooms and realizing a little bit from a very high

439
00:27:51,218 --> 00:27:53,499
level. There's two things. Number one,

440
00:27:53,499 --> 00:27:56,741
it should never feel like a good and bad choice.

441
00:27:56,741 --> 00:28:00,342
It should always feel like you're making a difficult choice between.

442
00:28:01,186 --> 00:28:08,073
Maybe on the surface it seems very simple, but as soon as you dig into it at all, it gets a lot more complex and

443
00:28:08,073 --> 00:28:10,275
Again, you know not only the character stuff

444
00:28:10,275 --> 00:28:17,061
I talked about earlier, but the character stuff on the side of the player letting the players

445
00:28:17,061 --> 00:28:18,102
develop I mean a

446
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:23,673
make any kind of character they want and play any character they want in any way they want

447
00:28:23,673 --> 00:28:29,917
is like one of our most important things in the game. We love our story, we love our characters,

448
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:34,100
but at the end of the day, we always are asking ourselves what are players going to

449
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,342
want to do when presented with this choice.

450
00:28:36,562 --> 00:28:40,605
And when we're playing through, you know, when we get feedback,

451
00:28:40,605 --> 00:28:42,847
whether it's from people on the team or people off the team,

452
00:28:42,847 --> 00:28:44,928
they're like, why couldn't I do this here?

453
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:49,552
And we're like, there has to be a really good reason in game that you can't do that there.

454
00:28:49,552 --> 00:28:51,613
Or we have to give you that option.

455
00:28:51,613 --> 00:28:55,716
Or we have to make it structured in a way that that option doesn't come up.

456
00:28:55,716 --> 00:28:59,159
So we're always looking at how can we pay the,

457
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:03,983
how can we not only let the player play how they want, but reward them for playing that way.

458
00:29:04,259 --> 00:29:09,441
Um that that is always at the forefront of our mind with with creating this these kind of this kind of content

459
00:29:09,441 --> 00:29:18,404
Yeah, it uh, it seems uh challenging to create um, lots of different opportunities for players to express themselves within the limited opportunities you have

460
00:29:18,404 --> 00:29:25,726
Uh given the scope of the game like, uh, do you go into it with like character player archetypes, you know explorers killers

461
00:29:25,726 --> 00:29:28,567
Whatever or is there is there a different process for trying to suss out?

462
00:29:28,567 --> 00:29:30,868
Um where players might want to go

463
00:29:31,488 --> 00:29:33,129
Yeah, we had 13 archetypes.

464
00:29:33,129 --> 00:29:35,430
Yeah, the one that Tim came up with for QA.

465
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:38,431
At the very basic level, it's the one we...

466
00:29:38,431 --> 00:29:44,774
the choices we came up with way back in Fallout are still at the heart of everything.

467
00:29:44,774 --> 00:29:50,657
It's you need to be able to talk your way, fight your way, or stealth your way through the game.

468
00:29:50,657 --> 00:29:54,279
We added leadership, which depends on companions.

469
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:57,621
And of course there's all the different ways, combinations, whether you're, you know,

470
00:29:57,621 --> 00:29:59,682
whether you're killing people, not trying to kill people,

471
00:29:59,682 --> 00:30:00,942
whether you're playing melee, ranged.

472
00:30:01,229 --> 00:30:03,249
you know, all those different facets to it.

473
00:30:03,249 --> 00:30:09,511
But really, you know, when we're developing these kind of things,

474
00:30:09,511 --> 00:30:15,372
it really always does come down to how can we really emphasize the player's choice.

475
00:30:15,372 --> 00:30:18,052
And, you know, one of the things I like to do with the riders is,

476
00:30:18,052 --> 00:30:23,133
you know, using Edgewater as an example, at the surface it might seem very simple.

477
00:30:23,133 --> 00:30:25,013
Oh, here's the group of people that are kind of bad.

478
00:30:25,013 --> 00:30:27,494
Here's the group of people who are kind of good.

479
00:30:27,494 --> 00:30:29,654
So, you know, I always want the riders to add.

480
00:30:29,774 --> 00:30:36,018
depth to the characters and having the character that might on the surface seem like the evil choice or the bad choice

481
00:30:36,018 --> 00:30:39,780
Is actually a very noble character who's who might be completely misguided

482
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:44,903
But is doing this for the right reasons and people who are doing the right thing might be doing the right thing for the wrong

483
00:30:44,903 --> 00:30:48,385
reasons so there's all these different ways that you can

484
00:30:48,385 --> 00:30:53,208
Come up with a basic choice and then layer all these different things into it to give it a bunch of different flavor

485
00:30:54,841 --> 00:30:57,764
That makes a lot of sense. There's a really good question here in chat that's very relevant.

486
00:30:57,764 --> 00:31:00,267
Sam P. asks, how do you deal with narrative disconnect?

487
00:31:00,267 --> 00:31:03,911
When do you address it and when do you just let game systems happen?

488
00:31:03,911 --> 00:31:12,079
I assume this is the sort of thing where you complete a quest and just blow somebody away right afterwards.

489
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:14,101
We don't. Some of that we try to deal with.

490
00:31:14,101 --> 00:31:16,063
I mean, a great example where.

491
00:31:16,655 --> 00:31:22,439
We could have pushed it further and we didn't is, you know, with Parvati, you pick her up in the first town,

492
00:31:22,439 --> 00:31:27,142
if you killed the people who were in the room with her when you pick her up, she's very upset about that,

493
00:31:27,142 --> 00:31:31,566
you know, but then you can go into town and just start blowing people away and she doesn't seem to notice.

494
00:31:31,566 --> 00:31:33,867
You know, that's the kind of thing that I was talking about earlier,

495
00:31:33,867 --> 00:31:38,210
where I would have loved to have, you know, made sure that we handled that,

496
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:42,934
like you killing people who were obviously your friends and not just the first people you were with when you got her.

497
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:49,080
So sometimes we don't have the opportunity to do as much of that as we would like.

498
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:52,723
So I think where it's important to us is that

499
00:31:53,557 --> 00:31:59,641
While you're doing the quest or these people are active in the world in terms of the questing and storyline,

500
00:31:59,641 --> 00:32:01,922
that's really important.

501
00:32:01,922 --> 00:32:07,705
If in a lot of ways it's after they've played their part and they're really kind of become, you know,

502
00:32:07,705 --> 00:32:11,147
don't really have a lot more to do in the game and the player starts killing them,

503
00:32:11,147 --> 00:32:13,348
except for the systemic reactivity,

504
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:17,671
we don't really put a lot of effort into making the whole game react to that.

505
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:19,733
And that's kind of the trade-off we make.

506
00:32:19,733 --> 00:32:25,980
Where in the past I think we would put more effort into those kind of things and have a much less polished game.

507
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:28,603
For sure. Man, I had no idea Felix had a dropkick.

508
00:32:28,603 --> 00:32:30,385
That's so crazy.

509
00:32:30,385 --> 00:32:30,826
Seriously.

510
00:32:30,826 --> 00:32:30,906
Good.

511
00:32:30,906 --> 00:32:31,847
That's his move.

512
00:32:31,847 --> 00:32:33,649
I gotta get more of that.

513
00:32:33,649 --> 00:32:35,771
I'll tell you about it if you want.

514
00:32:35,771 --> 00:32:36,011
Yeah, no doubt.

515
00:32:37,109 --> 00:32:40,032
So I want to jump back real quick. I mean, again, chat, you're killing it with questions.

516
00:32:40,032 --> 00:32:42,956
Keep throwing them out there. We'll keep going.

517
00:32:42,956 --> 00:32:44,558
But real quick about the humor and stuff.

518
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:48,302
Something that I realized really works for me in this game that hasn't always worked in the past is...

519
00:32:49,295 --> 00:32:53,858
The animation and none of its motion capture just incredibly good animation work on part of the team

520
00:32:53,858 --> 00:32:58,000
But the like a little stuff with the professor and you know little physical gags

521
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,302
I almost never see really good physical gags in a video game

522
00:33:01,302 --> 00:33:04,784
This might be one of the best I've seen especially in the beginning

523
00:33:04,784 --> 00:33:12,008
It was any special work or shout outs you want to give on already like advice for fellow devs on how to like get that

524
00:33:12,008 --> 00:33:15,911
Stuff working or was just a product of a really good animation team

525
00:33:18,213 --> 00:33:24,104
Both I think are you talking about the intro cinematic or just when yeah, I mean, yeah

526
00:33:25,548 --> 00:33:30,611
Well, because the reason I ask that is because in-game is different from how we do the cinematics.

527
00:33:30,611 --> 00:33:35,254
The cinematics, I mean even in-game we did a lot of motion capture, but there was a lot of hand animation,

528
00:33:35,254 --> 00:33:38,095
there was a lot of hand editing of those.

529
00:33:38,095 --> 00:33:45,020
In the cinematics, the intro cinematics specifically, there was a lot more motion capture involved.

530
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:48,422
And some of it was even done out of house with us directing them.

531
00:33:48,842 --> 00:33:53,205
on the things we wanted to see and how that would be accomplished.

532
00:33:53,205 --> 00:33:57,267
All the in-game stuff was done in-house, or most of it was done in-house,

533
00:33:57,267 --> 00:33:59,229
and that was a totally different process.

534
00:33:59,229 --> 00:34:05,233
We had to come up with some basic gestures that all different characters could use

535
00:34:05,233 --> 00:34:06,354
and try to mix and match those.

536
00:34:06,354 --> 00:34:08,195
Well, they're both great, and they killed it.

537
00:34:08,195 --> 00:34:12,458
Thank you. I think our animation team did a spectacular job on that stuff.

538
00:34:12,853 --> 00:34:17,816
Yeah, I'm not sure which is because I'm so used to games of this perspective being tying back to stuff

539
00:34:17,816 --> 00:34:19,958
You know from the fallout lineage and stuff

540
00:34:19,958 --> 00:34:27,443
Maybe there's been enough advancement since then in technology that it just feels more real

541
00:34:27,443 --> 00:34:31,826
But it just really works in this game in a way. I haven't seen before

542
00:34:31,826 --> 00:34:35,369
Yeah, right you're doing incredibly well

543
00:34:35,369 --> 00:34:35,809
I wonder

544
00:34:37,556 --> 00:34:44,760
I want to get into the business and sort of how you guys launched it and stuff, but before I do, I mean, you're both,

545
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:50,043
we tried to use this term sparingly, but you're both game industry veterans and I'm curious, like,

546
00:34:50,043 --> 00:34:55,046
you've worked on a number of titles in your careers and I wonder if there's any specific

547
00:34:55,046 --> 00:34:58,608
ones that really influenced the way you approach this game, whether it's Arcanum or

548
00:34:58,608 --> 00:35:00,849
Fallout or Diablo or anything else.

549
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:06,713
Well, I know when we started this, I took our lead designer, Charlie Staples, aside and said,

550
00:35:06,713 --> 00:35:07,133
look,

551
00:35:07,325 --> 00:35:11,407
Because I remember I said we started with, I did a lot of stupid things that I won't do again.

552
00:35:11,407 --> 00:35:15,530
I told Charlie, when I made Arcanum, if I had an idea, it went in.

553
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,992
So Arcanum is like chock full of every idea I had at the time.

554
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:22,654
Some of them did not belong together.

555
00:35:22,654 --> 00:35:23,815
So I told him to edit me.

556
00:35:23,815 --> 00:35:28,498
And so we had a lot of really cool things planned for this game.

557
00:35:28,498 --> 00:35:30,780
And Charlie really helped edit it down to like,

558
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:36,463
these are like the features at the heart of what you're trying to do.

559
00:35:37,591 --> 00:35:42,652
And also, if you like combat, that was all Charlie.

560
00:35:42,652 --> 00:35:47,733
So I think part of what we did was,

561
00:35:47,733 --> 00:35:50,373
Leonard and I have worked so long and so well together,

562
00:35:50,373 --> 00:35:51,334
and we trust each other.

563
00:35:51,334 --> 00:35:52,514
And we kind of extended that.

564
00:35:52,514 --> 00:35:56,195
We had a really good lead team that we also trusted.

565
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:59,535
And I think that, in turn, helped

566
00:35:59,535 --> 00:36:03,676
us make really good core mechanics that were in the game.

567
00:36:03,676 --> 00:36:05,976
Like you mentioned, you love Felix dropkick?

568
00:36:05,976 --> 00:36:06,777
I think that may have.

569
00:36:07,163 --> 00:36:09,926
From the animation department all we said was Felix

570
00:36:09,926 --> 00:36:14,710
Loves toss ball and carries a toss ball stick to hit people and I think they came back

571
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:19,774
They said hey, how about it first special attack? He actually the flying leap through the air and I'm like great

572
00:36:19,774 --> 00:36:20,614
It is great, it's fantastic

573
00:36:20,614 --> 00:36:22,256
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense

574
00:36:22,256 --> 00:36:27,520
I uh, there's been a lot of questions here in chat to sort of like what you expect the new game

575
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,843
They want to know when patches are coming when updates are coming

576
00:36:30,843 --> 00:36:34,045
I kind of wanted to hit all that and ask you guys like

577
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:42,784
In 2019 now that so many games are live games and like the process of releasing games seems to stretch three to nine months at least

578
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:46,226
Like how are you? How are you? How are you looking at this game and its launch?

579
00:36:46,226 --> 00:36:49,087
Are you sort of keeping an eye on it and hoping to keep it updated and fresh?

580
00:36:49,087 --> 00:36:53,070
Are you sort of putting it out there and giving you some time to sit before you come back to it?

581
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:57,432
Like how do you feel about supporting this game? And how is that different from the way you used to work on games?

582
00:36:58,263 --> 00:37:01,283
Well, at least now, the big thing for me is,

583
00:37:01,283 --> 00:37:02,524
so we launched the game,

584
00:37:02,524 --> 00:37:04,804
and I could immediately watch people playing it on screens.

585
00:37:04,804 --> 00:37:04,904
Right.

586
00:37:04,904 --> 00:37:07,325
So you can see what people do,

587
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:09,925
which sometimes isn't what they report.

588
00:37:09,925 --> 00:37:12,186
Like, they'll report a bug or two,

589
00:37:12,186 --> 00:37:13,646
but we're watching it going,

590
00:37:13,646 --> 00:37:14,146
that shouldn't happen.

591
00:37:14,146 --> 00:37:15,266
We should probably fix that.

592
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:20,287
There are things they aren't necessarily complaining about.

593
00:37:20,287 --> 00:37:21,588
But, not to toot our horn,

594
00:37:21,588 --> 00:37:22,668
but I want to toot it,

595
00:37:22,668 --> 00:37:25,249
we haven't had a whole lot of bugs,

596
00:37:25,249 --> 00:37:27,789
so it's not like our hotfix list was...

597
00:37:28,688 --> 00:37:30,869
full of things on fire that we had to fix.

598
00:37:30,869 --> 00:37:32,550
Yes, there was like a really rare crash

599
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,691
and there was some other things we wanted to fix

600
00:37:34,691 --> 00:37:35,751
that we saw should be happening.

601
00:37:35,751 --> 00:37:37,312
But for the most part, what we've been looking at

602
00:37:37,312 --> 00:37:38,852
is we're looking at what we call friction.

603
00:37:38,852 --> 00:37:42,073
Like people are playing and they're just having,

604
00:37:42,073 --> 00:37:45,315
they're hitting friction points on the UI

605
00:37:45,315 --> 00:37:46,795
or parts of the game that something

606
00:37:46,795 --> 00:37:48,316
isn't being messaged very well.

607
00:37:48,316 --> 00:37:50,636
And we're trying to get that done

608
00:37:50,636 --> 00:37:52,757
in a fix that will happen very, very soon.

609
00:37:52,757 --> 00:37:55,758
And then we'll keep watching how people play

610
00:37:55,758 --> 00:37:57,679
for a longer term patch a few months down the road.

611
00:37:59,142 --> 00:38:01,363
Right on. So let's talk about business.

612
00:38:01,363 --> 00:38:04,865
I would, you know, I mean, obviously everyone wants to know how well it's doing.

613
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:06,746
I expect you probably can't talk about that kind of stuff.

614
00:38:06,746 --> 00:38:08,947
But the platforms it's on are really interesting to me.

615
00:38:08,947 --> 00:38:12,069
I mean, you've got Windows consoles and then you're coming to Switch,

616
00:38:12,069 --> 00:38:13,270
I think next year is the plan.

617
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:17,632
So like was that challenging at all, that like multi-platform rollout?

618
00:38:17,632 --> 00:38:19,953
And I'm curious, like.

619
00:38:19,953 --> 00:38:23,575
Yes. OK, we'll start there.

620
00:38:23,575 --> 00:38:25,276
That.

621
00:38:26,045 --> 00:38:28,325
Was there anything new or challenging in that?

622
00:38:28,325 --> 00:38:30,606
Any advice you'd give other developers

623
00:38:30,606 --> 00:38:31,826
who are doing similar things,

624
00:38:31,826 --> 00:38:34,947
especially targeting the Switch, which seems challenging?

625
00:38:34,947 --> 00:38:36,787
Well, we're having the Switch developed out of house

626
00:38:36,787 --> 00:38:41,248
because three different platforms was enough for us.

627
00:38:41,248 --> 00:38:44,489
Yeah, so we found people who had done it before

628
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:46,950
and had experience with it.

629
00:38:47,567 --> 00:38:48,507
It was really hard.

630
00:38:48,507 --> 00:38:51,770
Have you made cross-platform games before?

631
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:53,291
Because you've worked on South Park.

632
00:38:53,291 --> 00:38:56,533
I'd never made... I mean, when I worked on Diablo,

633
00:38:56,533 --> 00:38:59,115
I worked on the PC SKU,

634
00:38:59,115 --> 00:39:02,117
and then they made the console SKU in-house,

635
00:39:02,117 --> 00:39:03,038
but it was a separate team.

636
00:39:03,038 --> 00:39:05,839
So this was the first time I worked on a multi-platform.

637
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:12,723
game. However, being that I'm more involved in the conceptual side of the art and the writing,

638
00:39:12,723 --> 00:39:18,566
the technical side of the art changes from platform to platform, but conceptually it doesn't

639
00:39:18,566 --> 00:39:22,047
change. And the writing is exactly the same. So I don't have to worry about any of that.

640
00:39:22,047 --> 00:39:25,549
Tim, on the other hand, has to stress on all of that.

641
00:39:25,549 --> 00:39:29,131
Yeah, we had, I mean, the UI, there were differences in UI, especially input.

642
00:39:29,231 --> 00:39:35,538
Trying to get all the stuff we wanted on a keyboard mapped onto a controller in a way that made sense.

643
00:39:35,538 --> 00:39:39,383
We went through several different iterations of how to control things.

644
00:39:39,383 --> 00:39:44,288
We actually ended up dropping some features just because there was no way to map it onto a controller.

645
00:39:45,391 --> 00:39:52,358
I think what was really important though was we kept all three platforms, the PC, PS4 and Xbox, kind of in parity.

646
00:39:52,358 --> 00:39:56,923
We built a new build every day, so every day we got it we had a brand new build.

647
00:39:56,923 --> 00:39:59,486
Whatever new went in was there.

648
00:39:59,486 --> 00:40:05,693
I got in really early and a few of the testers got in really early, and we had it tested usually before the rest of the team got in.

649
00:40:05,993 --> 00:40:13,437
We knew whether the build seemed stable and then everybody else could jump on the team could jump onto the new build

650
00:40:13,437 --> 00:40:18,841
And we test all three right away in the morning and pretty much the biggest difference. I guess was UI and

651
00:40:18,841 --> 00:40:25,805
Input, but I yeah, I think the really important point about that at least for me was from the very beginning. We both said

652
00:40:26,497 --> 00:40:33,803
We want to design an interface that's obviously the more interfaces we could design that are going to work on all three the better

653
00:40:33,803 --> 00:40:37,947
However, we don't want to compromise one of the skews

654
00:40:37,947 --> 00:40:43,431
To make it easier to make another one or vice versa. We wanted each one to feel really good

655
00:40:43,431 --> 00:40:45,813
PC shouldn't feel like a console port. Yes

656
00:40:45,813 --> 00:40:50,737
None of them should feel like a port of the other basically they should all feel good

657
00:40:50,737 --> 00:40:54,400
Our our pcui should feel like a pcui our console ui should feel like a console ui

658
00:40:55,603 --> 00:40:58,045
Yeah, I um, there's questions in chat about the font size

659
00:40:58,045 --> 00:41:01,166
I know that must be tricky to work out on tvs for consoles versus pc

660
00:41:01,166 --> 00:41:07,169
I mean you could be like 10 feet away versus like a foot away. So I imagine that's wild. Um,

661
00:41:07,169 --> 00:41:07,990
you know

662
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:12,392
Real quick as long as we're talking about font size and text. Um,

663
00:41:12,392 --> 00:41:15,914
How did you settle on the name the outer worlds and have you played the outer wilds yet?

664
00:41:15,914 --> 00:41:19,516
Yes, I played outer wilds and it was really good. Yeah

665
00:41:19,516 --> 00:41:24,018
We we had a few different names, but we really liked outer worlds

666
00:41:24,018 --> 00:41:24,778
and

667
00:41:25,569 --> 00:41:30,072
Didn't we even talk with them about Outer Wilds?

668
00:41:30,072 --> 00:41:33,214
Yeah, we couldn't come up with any other name we liked.

669
00:41:33,214 --> 00:41:36,697
And we hadn't heard, at least I don't think Tim or I had,

670
00:41:36,697 --> 00:41:39,939
heard of the Outer Wilds when we proposed Outer Worlds.

671
00:41:39,939 --> 00:41:42,301
And then we found out about it fairly quickly afterwards.

672
00:41:42,301 --> 00:41:43,822
And we're like, isn't this a concern?

673
00:41:43,822 --> 00:41:45,043
Should we keep looking?

674
00:41:45,043 --> 00:41:47,244
And I think everybody was just kind of tired

675
00:41:47,244 --> 00:41:49,025
of trying to find a name at that point.

676
00:41:49,025 --> 00:41:51,647
Because we had come up with like actually one or two

677
00:41:51,647 --> 00:41:54,069
that we liked, I don't even remember what they were now,

678
00:41:54,069 --> 00:41:54,529
but.

679
00:41:54,772 --> 00:41:58,074
had already had games or books or something else

680
00:41:58,074 --> 00:41:58,634
using that name.

681
00:41:58,634 --> 00:42:01,976
So I think it was a combination of fatigue

682
00:42:01,976 --> 00:42:04,438
and the fact that Outer Wilds was supposed to be out

683
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:06,919
like six months before us or something like that.

684
00:42:06,919 --> 00:42:09,120
You know, we're figuring, well, that's not a problem

685
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,202
because, you know, game dev never slips.

686
00:42:11,202 --> 00:42:16,805
Well, plus we have the perfect solution for gamers by both.

687
00:42:16,805 --> 00:42:17,145
Exactly.

688
00:42:17,145 --> 00:42:19,026
They're both good by both.

689
00:42:19,026 --> 00:42:19,507
Absolutely.

690
00:42:19,507 --> 00:42:21,008
I cannot agree more.

691
00:42:21,008 --> 00:42:23,089
Most positive answer to have that question.

692
00:42:24,015 --> 00:42:25,155
Brian, how you doing in there?

693
00:42:25,155 --> 00:42:25,676
I'm doing okay.

694
00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:26,776
What was that?

695
00:42:26,776 --> 00:42:28,117
I didn't hear what he said.

696
00:42:28,117 --> 00:42:29,058
Oh, sorry, I was mumbling.

697
00:42:29,058 --> 00:42:30,719
I should have spoken up clearer.

698
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:33,220
I was saying that's the most positive answer I've ever heard to that kind of question.

699
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:35,302
Yeah, I haven't played it, but I hear it's a fantastic game.

700
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:35,942
I got to get it.

701
00:42:35,942 --> 00:42:37,403
And they're both sci-fi.

702
00:42:37,403 --> 00:42:37,523
Yeah.

703
00:42:37,523 --> 00:42:37,663
Yeah.

704
00:42:37,663 --> 00:42:37,763
Yeah.

705
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:38,023
Yeah.

706
00:42:38,023 --> 00:42:38,163
Yeah.

707
00:42:38,163 --> 00:42:38,564
Yeah.

708
00:42:38,564 --> 00:42:38,804
Yeah.

709
00:42:38,804 --> 00:42:38,944
Yeah.

710
00:42:38,944 --> 00:42:39,084
Yeah.

711
00:42:39,084 --> 00:42:39,164
Yeah.

712
00:42:39,164 --> 00:42:39,324
Yeah.

713
00:42:39,324 --> 00:42:39,624
Yeah.

714
00:42:39,624 --> 00:42:39,704
Yeah.

715
00:42:39,704 --> 00:42:39,784
Yeah.

716
00:42:39,784 --> 00:42:39,864
Yeah.

717
00:42:39,864 --> 00:42:40,044
Yeah.

718
00:42:40,044 --> 00:42:40,185
Yeah.

719
00:42:40,185 --> 00:42:40,285
Yeah.

720
00:42:40,285 --> 00:42:40,365
Yeah.

721
00:42:41,313 --> 00:42:44,874
Both fantastic. I can't believe we only have about 15 minutes left

722
00:42:44,874 --> 00:42:49,616
But we only have about 15 minutes left folks and chat if you want to get your questions in we would love to have your

723
00:42:49,616 --> 00:42:53,018
design and development focus questions

724
00:42:53,018 --> 00:42:57,060
We think you have been asking some wonderful stuff. Thank you all for joining us

725
00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:04,663
I'm acting like I'm ending the stream, but I'm not um. I just ducked back to my ship for a minute to do a

726
00:43:04,663 --> 00:43:10,085
Repair repair and ammo ammo figure figure out my ammo situation cuz I was running out out there um

727
00:43:10,565 --> 00:43:21,810
Tim and Leonard, my question for you, um, one of the things I've observed about this game, like the big challenge of making games like this compared to say Fallout New Vegas, is um, how you space out things in the world.

728
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:25,812
Um, my complaints about Fallout New Vegas was, um, every faction area...

729
00:43:26,352 --> 00:43:34,802
which was a lot of areas in the game, felt a little odd because every faction had to be ready to turn into a combat zone at a second's notice if you shot someone.

730
00:43:34,802 --> 00:43:44,032
So they didn't have some of the explorery things they liked because they were also loot zones, like combat loot zones, as opposed to carefully crafted dungeons.

731
00:43:44,032 --> 00:43:44,612
In this game...

732
00:43:45,033 --> 00:43:48,834
I have the opposite problem, which is every faction zone feels great and alive and populated,

733
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:53,256
and that area we were just wandering through, I noticed, is a little more empty than other

734
00:43:53,256 --> 00:43:58,718
games of its type, which I'm not trying to rag on Outer Worlds here, this is just an observation I

735
00:43:58,718 --> 00:44:03,479
had. How have you sort of dealt with the concept of filling out spaces and making sure they feel

736
00:44:03,479 --> 00:44:08,501
like a living world, even when you have the budget to only produce like a tiny aquarium-sized world?

737
00:44:08,501 --> 00:44:08,741
Um...

738
00:44:11,324 --> 00:44:18,430
Very carefully, we tried to fill out the areas as much as possible.

739
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:21,572
In terms of faction areas versus non-faction areas,

740
00:44:21,572 --> 00:44:25,215
that was something that kind of just happened a little bit naturally.

741
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:28,177
I don't think we were really considering that because, you know,

742
00:44:28,177 --> 00:44:30,699
you could turn any of our areas into a combat areas as well,

743
00:44:30,699 --> 00:44:34,002
even if it didn't have anything to do with factions.

744
00:44:34,002 --> 00:44:36,824
But I feel like, you know, I kind of agree.

745
00:44:36,824 --> 00:44:39,246
I think I feel like we should have had a little bit more.

746
00:44:39,506 --> 00:44:43,571
content for you to explore and find on Monarch, but that's some of that stuff is

747
00:44:43,571 --> 00:44:47,997
kind of where we we made choices of like okay we're gonna we're gonna really

748
00:44:47,997 --> 00:44:51,421
polish this stuff. We also tried to always use like I used to call it the

749
00:44:51,421 --> 00:44:53,824
roller coaster model of design where

750
00:44:54,696 --> 00:45:02,383
There's space to do some exploring, and there's space to do some combat, and there's space to talk to people, and that should vary up as you play.

751
00:45:02,383 --> 00:45:12,352
There's no area in the game where there's like two hours of solid talking, or nothing, you don't do anything but fight for two hours, or you don't do anything but explore.

752
00:45:12,352 --> 00:45:16,796
Because it's fun to have that broken up by other things you can do, and you kind of get all the different skills.

753
00:45:18,692 --> 00:45:20,934
Like early on we had a few levels where I'm like,

754
00:45:20,934 --> 00:45:22,935
I'm doing an awful lot of fighting in here

755
00:45:22,935 --> 00:45:24,636
and there's nobody to talk to.

756
00:45:24,636 --> 00:45:27,218
So we actively tried to break that up.

757
00:45:27,218 --> 00:45:27,578
Right on.

758
00:45:27,578 --> 00:45:30,620
There's a question here in chat that I like

759
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:31,820
because it's just so bold.

760
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:35,023
Daza wants to know, do you plan on improving

761
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:38,345
simulation elements such as NPC scheduling in the sequel?

762
00:45:38,345 --> 00:45:40,326
And what do you think about integrating

763
00:45:40,326 --> 00:45:41,887
quests with simulation systems?

764
00:45:41,887 --> 00:45:43,408
So yeah, apparently yeah, I'm making a sequel.

765
00:45:43,728 --> 00:45:45,048
I didn't know that.

766
00:45:45,048 --> 00:45:47,189
I would have been right on that sequel.

767
00:45:47,189 --> 00:45:47,369
Yeah.

768
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:50,891
There's a lot of things about NPCs that would be fun to do.

769
00:45:50,891 --> 00:45:55,553
About the scheduling though, we actually talked about that early on.

770
00:45:55,553 --> 00:46:00,735
I actually always got a little annoyed when it's like,

771
00:46:00,735 --> 00:46:02,415
oh, I want to go sell myself to the shopkeeper.

772
00:46:02,415 --> 00:46:03,456
Oh, it's closed.

773
00:46:03,456 --> 00:46:07,257
And then it's like, do I break in and get them out of bed?

774
00:46:07,257 --> 00:46:08,218
I just like this.

775
00:46:08,218 --> 00:46:10,298
Our shopkeepers are always there.

776
00:46:11,456 --> 00:46:14,278
Our vending machines are always on.

777
00:46:14,278 --> 00:46:20,762
We have day-night cycles, but we kind of steered away from making the player have to watch a clock.

778
00:46:20,762 --> 00:46:24,244
In fact, you'll notice there isn't even a clock in our game.

779
00:46:24,244 --> 00:46:34,891
Because we had no timed quests and we had no scheduled quests that could only be done at a particular time of day or after a particular wait.

780
00:46:34,891 --> 00:46:35,291
Right.

781
00:46:35,291 --> 00:46:39,874
Yeah, right on. I just thought there was no time in space.

782
00:46:39,874 --> 00:46:40,054
Or a statue.

783
00:46:41,497 --> 00:46:44,138
Maybe we can dig into a little bit. We only got about 10 minutes left here

784
00:46:44,138 --> 00:46:46,700
But I definitely want to get more into the companions as well

785
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:50,382
So I mean they're a big part of this game and their charm sort of pulls you through

786
00:46:50,382 --> 00:46:55,345
Beaconfield wants to know where do the ideas for Parvati and Ellie come from are any of the companions based on real people?

787
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:55,645
Not that I know of

788
00:46:59,382 --> 00:47:03,084
Parvati came from Chris Latois, one of our writers.

789
00:47:03,084 --> 00:47:06,306
He started the character, Kate Dollarhide finished her.

790
00:47:06,306 --> 00:47:10,668
So that was basically a combination of both of them.

791
00:47:10,668 --> 00:47:14,310
We had some very basic ideas

792
00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:17,751
of what she needed to do in the game,

793
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:20,092
but her personality and who she was

794
00:47:20,092 --> 00:47:22,314
was very much their creation.

795
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:28,723
For Ellie, it was a little bit of a different path.

796
00:47:28,723 --> 00:47:32,104
She was also worked on by two different writers,

797
00:47:32,104 --> 00:47:34,425
Dan McPhee and Carrie Patel.

798
00:47:34,994 --> 00:47:38,116
And Felix is kind of in the same category as Ellie.

799
00:47:38,116 --> 00:47:39,857
We were making our vertical slice,

800
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:41,778
and we just had to come up with two companions

801
00:47:41,778 --> 00:47:43,479
to start proving out systems.

802
00:47:43,479 --> 00:47:44,940
So we came up with Felix and Ellie,

803
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:48,202
and there really wasn't a whole lot of discussion

804
00:47:48,202 --> 00:47:50,644
put into what their place in the game was

805
00:47:50,644 --> 00:47:52,705
and what they were supposed to represent thematically.

806
00:47:52,705 --> 00:47:54,607
It was just like, let's make some characters

807
00:47:54,607 --> 00:47:57,729
who would be interesting to have banter with each other

808
00:47:57,729 --> 00:47:59,850
and to interject into conversations.

809
00:47:59,850 --> 00:48:02,792
So that really came out of those writers just...

810
00:48:03,813 --> 00:48:08,177
Natai Podara wrote Felix, and Dan McPhee at the time was writing Ellie,

811
00:48:08,177 --> 00:48:12,702
and they just wrote these characters and came up with some interesting things about them.

812
00:48:12,702 --> 00:48:18,688
Felix just kept getting revised and iterated on by Natai as we went through the whole game,

813
00:48:18,688 --> 00:48:22,251
and then at a certain point, Carrie took over Ellie and kind of revamped some of her.

814
00:48:22,552 --> 00:48:33,979
But that was really interesting because every other NPC in the game kind of came about to fit a certain spot in your party or to fit a certain story kind of style or theme.

815
00:48:33,979 --> 00:48:38,762
And those two really just started out as like, we need two characters, two companions to follow the player around.

816
00:48:38,762 --> 00:48:42,064
Let's just jump in and make some interesting characters.

817
00:48:42,064 --> 00:48:45,446
And then we kind of like figured out where they fit in the world after that.

818
00:48:45,446 --> 00:48:50,289
It's interesting to note, Roseway was our first like zone that we made.

819
00:48:50,808 --> 00:48:54,151
that had all the quests in it and NPCs and all that.

820
00:48:54,151 --> 00:48:56,993
And Ellie and Felix were the two characters

821
00:48:56,993 --> 00:48:58,454
that just, they were already,

822
00:48:58,454 --> 00:48:59,355
when you started up that zone,

823
00:48:59,355 --> 00:49:01,357
they were just already attached to you.

824
00:49:01,357 --> 00:49:03,078
So I probably played Roseway with Ellie and Felix

825
00:49:03,078 --> 00:49:06,020
at least five or six dozen times.

826
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:08,182
And it's funny now to play it with them

827
00:49:08,182 --> 00:49:12,446
because it just reminds me of two years ago.

828
00:49:12,446 --> 00:49:16,229
We had a lot of that banter stuff working even back then.

829
00:49:16,229 --> 00:49:16,789
Right on.

830
00:49:18,087 --> 00:49:22,212
I wonder, I assume every writer brings their own inspirations and influences to whatever

831
00:49:22,212 --> 00:49:26,436
they touch, but I imagine you guys had a lot of control given your lead role in the project.

832
00:49:26,436 --> 00:49:30,040
Was there any specific influences or inspirations that shaped the tone of this game?

833
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:32,803
I get a lot of stuff like Firefly and Red Dwarf, but is there anything else?

834
00:49:34,152 --> 00:49:38,576
Yeah, besides just our senses of humor.

835
00:49:38,576 --> 00:49:42,480
We yeah, Firefly, we talk a lot about the Simpsons and Futurama.

836
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,503
We were huge for the writers.

837
00:49:45,503 --> 00:49:47,004
Specifically, I really

838
00:49:47,004 --> 00:49:50,667
talked to them a lot about Brazil, the movie Brazil.

839
00:49:50,667 --> 00:49:55,211
Yeah. Some Wes Anderson movies, some of the darker Coen Brothers movies.

840
00:49:55,692 --> 00:49:57,973
early Kurt Vonnegut.

841
00:49:57,973 --> 00:49:59,974
So we just kind of like really talked a lot

842
00:49:59,974 --> 00:50:02,675
about a bunch of different influences like that

843
00:50:02,675 --> 00:50:05,057
and how and what type of things we wanted them

844
00:50:05,057 --> 00:50:06,677
to look at from each.

845
00:50:06,677 --> 00:50:10,559
A great example of that with Wes Anderson for instance

846
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:12,340
is I think the Grand Budapest Hotel

847
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:16,262
has some really sweet, endearing characters

848
00:50:16,262 --> 00:50:18,964
and also some very, very broad characters

849
00:50:18,964 --> 00:50:21,825
with a lot of, and there's a lot of kind of

850
00:50:22,326 --> 00:50:27,633
sorrow and depth and darkness there with a very kind of like silly overtone to it

851
00:50:27,633 --> 00:50:31,098
so I thought that was like a really good touchstone for for people who weren't as

852
00:50:31,098 --> 00:50:34,623
familiar with some of the games we made in the past but I love how writers ran

853
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:36,405
with it because like Sam

854
00:50:36,917 --> 00:50:39,397
Sam was my idea, but all I said was,

855
00:50:39,397 --> 00:50:41,538
I want a robot in the game.

856
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:42,619
He's a cleaning robot.

857
00:50:42,619 --> 00:50:44,279
He's not sentient at all.

858
00:50:44,279 --> 00:50:46,700
And all he does, everything he says,

859
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:49,961
is something about cleaning or him being a robot.

860
00:50:49,961 --> 00:50:53,082
And Megan Stark just went overboard.

861
00:50:53,082 --> 00:50:55,023
The stuff she did was so good.

862
00:50:55,023 --> 00:50:58,184
Because sometimes you'll be in a situation

863
00:50:58,184 --> 00:50:59,825
and Sam will say something

864
00:50:59,825 --> 00:51:02,666
that's just what you'd expect to pop out of a robot,

865
00:51:02,666 --> 00:51:05,627
but it's kind of a meta commentary on what's going on.

866
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,001
And it's very funny.

867
00:51:07,001 --> 00:51:10,303
I think she nailed that character.

868
00:51:10,303 --> 00:51:10,884
Yeah, totally.

869
00:51:10,884 --> 00:51:13,686
We got about five minutes left.

870
00:51:13,686 --> 00:51:16,468
So any last pressing questions, please get them in.

871
00:51:16,468 --> 00:51:19,611
Brian, do you have any of your own?

872
00:51:19,611 --> 00:51:19,871
What?

873
00:51:19,871 --> 00:51:21,553
We kind of glided past it, even though I've

874
00:51:21,553 --> 00:51:23,654
been spending so much of this encounter in combat.

875
00:51:23,654 --> 00:51:27,137
What do you think makes good combat?

876
00:51:27,137 --> 00:51:28,899
Like, why is this game sort of not just

877
00:51:28,899 --> 00:51:31,981
like me talking to everyone?

878
00:51:31,981 --> 00:51:33,983
Like, what was your guiding light for making

879
00:51:33,983 --> 00:51:34,684
this gunfire feel good?

880
00:51:34,684 --> 00:51:35,144
Or melee?

881
00:51:36,806 --> 00:51:38,447
Wow, we just barely pulled Charlie in.

882
00:51:38,447 --> 00:51:41,728
I wanted it to be impactful, especially melee.

883
00:51:41,728 --> 00:51:43,529
We had a lot of talks about, hey, we

884
00:51:43,529 --> 00:51:47,050
have a lot of guns in our game, but melee has to hold its own.

885
00:51:47,050 --> 00:51:51,412
So all of our melee weapons have a really strong hit impact.

886
00:51:51,724 --> 00:51:56,749
They all do area of effect. They basically all hit anything that they sweep through.

887
00:51:56,749 --> 00:52:00,073
People aren't mentioning this, but melees are automatic hits.

888
00:52:00,073 --> 00:52:04,298
If you're standing near someone and you swing your weapon, it always hits.

889
00:52:04,298 --> 00:52:08,763
The amount of damage you do varies, but you always hit with a melee weapon.

890
00:52:08,763 --> 00:52:13,268
And they often do lots of damage against swarms, like Mantis swarms.

891
00:52:13,595 --> 00:52:15,437
So we had a lot of interesting rules like that,

892
00:52:15,437 --> 00:52:19,140
to just make sure that combat always felt really good,

893
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:21,082
no matter what weapon you were holding.

894
00:52:21,082 --> 00:52:22,603
Like, all the weapons are different.

895
00:52:22,603 --> 00:52:24,725
We had the plasma charge up in really early,

896
00:52:24,725 --> 00:52:26,967
and that's a totally different way of using a weapon

897
00:52:26,967 --> 00:52:29,469
than, say, spray and pray with a machine gun.

898
00:52:29,469 --> 00:52:31,891
But they all work.

899
00:52:31,891 --> 00:52:33,692
You put points into them, they get better,

900
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:35,274
no matter what style you like.

901
00:52:35,274 --> 00:52:37,335
That's something I really like in this very RPG-esque.

902
00:52:37,335 --> 00:52:40,078
No matter what gun you like in this game,

903
00:52:40,078 --> 00:52:42,600
you can find, or gun style, you can find a gun like it.

904
00:52:43,079 --> 00:52:45,941
put points into that skill and just have fun with it.

905
00:52:46,973 --> 00:52:49,395
Although you tend to run out of ammo if you like machinima.

906
00:52:49,395 --> 00:52:56,199
As you can see from the stream, I am unfortunately dealing with some ammo loss challenges.

907
00:52:56,199 --> 00:52:58,080
Happen to me all the time.

908
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:02,023
There you go. Alright, buddy. Stay down.

909
00:53:02,023 --> 00:53:04,524
Wow, we are coming to the end of the stream.

910
00:53:04,524 --> 00:53:09,047
Thank you everyone so much for watching. Thank you Tim and Leonard for joining us today.

911
00:53:09,047 --> 00:53:10,628
Thank you. Thanks for having us.

912
00:53:10,628 --> 00:53:15,351
Alex, unless there's anything you want to get in right now, I'm going to start wrapping things up, but that's okay.

913
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:18,622
No, this game's great. This game's fantastic.

914
00:53:18,622 --> 00:53:19,062
Thank you.

915
00:53:19,062 --> 00:53:19,543
More games.

916
00:53:19,543 --> 00:53:24,467
So cool. I could literally spend the next five minutes just complimenting the game,

917
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:28,590
but I have endings or moves to complete. Thank you so much to Tim and Leonard for joining us

918
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:33,654
here on the GDC Twitch channel. Thank you to all for watching. If you are a fan of games and how

919
00:53:33,654 --> 00:53:37,497
they get made, we'd encourage you to hit that follow button because if you do, you will get

920
00:53:37,497 --> 00:53:41,440
notifications on when we get live. And when we go live, we will always be talking to interesting

921
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,482
developers or doing something that is...

922
00:53:44,283 --> 00:53:47,345
We're big believers in the process of making games,

923
00:53:47,345 --> 00:53:50,328
tells us so much about why we enjoy the games we enjoy,

924
00:53:50,328 --> 00:53:53,010
we think it's valuable for people who like games,

925
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:57,794
for people who just play games, so that's why we do what we do.

926
00:53:57,794 --> 00:54:00,336
If you are a developer yourself,

927
00:54:00,336 --> 00:54:01,877
we'd love to have you at GDC next year.

928
00:54:01,877 --> 00:54:04,299
There are so many really interesting things to do at GDC,

929
00:54:04,299 --> 00:54:06,761
interesting ways to learn about making games.

930
00:54:06,761 --> 00:54:10,744
You can scroll down on this page and click on the bypass

931
00:54:10,744 --> 00:54:12,105
to learn more about our passes for GDC.

932
00:54:13,306 --> 00:54:20,814
And I guess it's, I'd do best to say that this time of year, while we're still in the early pricing period,

933
00:54:20,814 --> 00:54:23,536
it's also the time to get the best price on your pass.

934
00:54:23,536 --> 00:54:28,081
For everyone else, I hope you have a good day, I hope you have a good time in the colonies,

935
00:54:28,081 --> 00:54:31,604
and I guess the board wishes you well.

936
00:54:31,604 --> 00:54:33,846
Although I don't like the board. I'm not going to do anything for the board.

937
00:54:35,427 --> 00:54:44,169
Oh, I guess I'll ask this question. We've had a lot of great questions in chat about support, about other factors that we didn't want to quite throw in because we wanted to keep things dead focused.

938
00:54:44,169 --> 00:54:48,330
If they want to ask those questions, where should they ask them for? Where can they reach you guys?

939
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:53,772
Support at obsidian.net. We also have obsidian forums.

940
00:54:53,772 --> 00:54:57,733
Yes, we have forums. They're welcome to reach us out.

941
00:54:57,733 --> 00:55:02,214
So that'll be forums at obsidian.net.

942
00:55:02,214 --> 00:55:03,615
Yeah.

943
00:55:04,618 --> 00:55:05,559
I just want to say real quick.

944
00:55:05,559 --> 00:55:07,100
We have a page on Facebook.

945
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:07,701
Oh, perfect.

946
00:55:07,701 --> 00:55:08,641
Facebook as well.

947
00:55:08,641 --> 00:55:11,463
Before we sign off, there's a bunch of great talks.

948
00:55:11,463 --> 00:55:13,705
I know I'm a company man, but there's

949
00:55:13,705 --> 00:55:15,927
a bunch of great talks on the GDC YouTube channel

950
00:55:15,927 --> 00:55:18,408
that are totally free to watch, including some, I think,

951
00:55:18,408 --> 00:55:20,190
dating back to other Obsidian games,

952
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:21,771
some from these folks as well.

953
00:55:21,771 --> 00:55:24,393
I think Tim, one of your Fallout postmortems is on there,

954
00:55:24,393 --> 00:55:25,954
and it's incredible.

955
00:55:25,954 --> 00:55:26,794
So go watch those.

956
00:55:26,794 --> 00:55:27,855
They're good, and they're free.

957
00:55:27,855 --> 00:55:29,957
And there are more great content like this.

958
00:55:32,028 --> 00:55:34,802
Alright everyone, have a good day. Bye!

959
00:55:34,802 --> 00:55:34,982
You too, bye!
