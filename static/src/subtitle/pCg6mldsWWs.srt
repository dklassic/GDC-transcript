1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,964
ready? Let's do this. Okay. So before we get started, I have to do the essentials. Turn off

2
00:00:11,024 --> 00:00:15,247
noise makers. Especially beepers. If you have one of those, just chuck it outside. Because

3
00:00:15,847 --> 00:00:21,271
that is just a problem. Anyways, you'll also be getting evals at the end. Excellent is

4
00:00:21,611 --> 00:00:25,553
recommended. Good is okay. But definitely excellent is what we ask you to give.

5
00:00:26,334 --> 00:00:27,834
So let me introduce myself first.

6
00:00:28,134 --> 00:00:29,615
I'm Grant Schonkweiler, as you can see,

7
00:00:30,295 --> 00:00:31,776
commander in Schonk at Schonk Ventures,

8
00:00:31,796 --> 00:00:32,856
because when you start your own company,

9
00:00:32,876 --> 00:00:34,457
you can make up your title, so that's pretty cool.

10
00:00:35,237 --> 00:00:37,057
I'll be your moderator and timekeeper,

11
00:00:37,338 --> 00:00:38,778
which you don't have to worry about the timekeeper,

12
00:00:38,998 --> 00:00:39,738
that's more for them.

13
00:00:40,419 --> 00:00:42,159
Before Garth gets started here, though,

14
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,320
I wanted to introduce the talk.

15
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,901
And it is a talk, it kind of looks like a panel,

16
00:00:47,221 --> 00:00:48,982
kind of looks like micro talks, whatever,

17
00:00:49,142 --> 00:00:51,443
but really, it's one cohesive story

18
00:00:51,923 --> 00:00:53,223
told by four different people,

19
00:00:53,723 --> 00:00:54,784
these amazing people right here.

20
00:00:55,724 --> 00:00:57,225
And you may have read this, you may have seen this

21
00:00:57,345 --> 00:00:59,327
in the guide or hopefully you read it,

22
00:01:00,067 --> 00:01:02,469
that this is more about the feel portion of being a producer.

23
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:06,312
You know, we all know about Agile and Scrum

24
00:01:06,352 --> 00:01:07,793
and Kanban and all those things,

25
00:01:08,154 --> 00:01:10,495
but what we wanted to talk about is the feel portion,

26
00:01:10,535 --> 00:01:12,057
the soft skills of being a producer,

27
00:01:12,717 --> 00:01:14,598
the one-on-one relationships that you have

28
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:15,759
with the people on your team.

29
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,701
So that's what we're gonna get into today.

30
00:01:17,721 --> 00:01:19,582
Oops.

31
00:01:21,504 --> 00:01:22,564
Go slide.

32
00:01:23,681 --> 00:01:24,903
This is that awkward part?

33
00:01:25,023 --> 00:01:27,586
Okay, so, but we are producers, right?

34
00:01:27,646 --> 00:01:30,149
So we need to have some sort of agenda for our meeting,

35
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,471
I mean, talk today.

36
00:01:31,551 --> 00:01:32,933
So Garth's gonna come up first.

37
00:01:33,354 --> 00:01:35,336
He's gonna talk about For the Love of the Video Game.

38
00:01:36,037 --> 00:01:37,880
Oxana will then talk about Building Team Culture.

39
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,581
Chuck Charles will talk about creating thriving teams,

40
00:01:42,122 --> 00:01:43,762
and then Brian will close us out

41
00:01:43,782 --> 00:01:45,563
with conflict in the workplace.

42
00:01:46,724 --> 00:01:48,405
So yeah, I'm gonna introduce everybody,

43
00:01:48,465 --> 00:01:50,726
and then get ready, there's an interactive portion of this.

44
00:01:50,746 --> 00:01:52,387
So don't fall asleep, I know it's Thursday.

45
00:01:52,747 --> 00:01:53,868
Just stay ready.

46
00:01:54,528 --> 00:01:55,689
So let me introduce Garth first.

47
00:01:56,109 --> 00:02:01,032
He is a senior producer at Fraxis Games, overseeing the XCOM franchise since 2010.

48
00:02:01,792 --> 00:02:07,196
He began his career in design on XCOM Enemy Unknown in an IGF student prototype called

49
00:02:07,236 --> 00:02:08,076
Winds of Orbis.

50
00:02:08,576 --> 00:02:13,159
In a previous life, he was a VP at a large financial institution before pursuing his

51
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:15,581
Masters of Entertainment Technology at Carnegie Mellon.

52
00:02:16,621 --> 00:02:20,805
Garth was instrumental in coming up with the format and session idea for this a few years

53
00:02:20,865 --> 00:02:24,747
ago but wasn't able to make it because he's working on a little game called XCOM 2.

54
00:02:25,428 --> 00:02:27,389
So we're super happy to have him here this year.

55
00:02:27,409 --> 00:02:28,630
Alright Garth, take it away.

56
00:02:34,303 --> 00:02:36,304
So yes, we're gonna talk about trust mechanics.

57
00:02:36,505 --> 00:02:38,606
I'm very excited to be here today to talk about

58
00:02:38,907 --> 00:02:40,768
the harder part of our job, which is the soft skills.

59
00:02:40,788 --> 00:02:44,031
So, this will not be a talk about Agile, Waterfall,

60
00:02:44,471 --> 00:02:46,973
Scrum, Kanban, Lean, Six Sigma,

61
00:02:47,774 --> 00:02:49,755
or any other hybrid approach that I'm sure you guys

62
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:52,578
are using in some form on your projects right now.

63
00:02:52,918 --> 00:02:54,559
But there is no silver bullet,

64
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,081
as evidenced by our repeated post-mortem mistakes

65
00:02:57,101 --> 00:02:58,262
that we all share with each other.

66
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:01,505
So, process is important, I wanna make that clear.

67
00:03:02,105 --> 00:03:05,629
But what if when it comes to enabling a culture for a team to find success,

68
00:03:06,089 --> 00:03:08,631
we've been focusing a little bit too much on the wrong area?

69
00:03:09,592 --> 00:03:11,954
This is a quote from Pixar president Ed Catmull.

70
00:03:11,994 --> 00:03:16,158
He's created a few hits that I'm sure you guys are aware of from his book, Creativity Inc.

71
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:20,222
You can't manage what you can't measure as a maxim that is taught and believed by many

72
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:21,923
in both the business and education sectors.

73
00:03:21,964 --> 00:03:23,885
But in fact, the phrase is ridiculous.

74
00:03:24,386 --> 00:03:26,848
Something said by people who are unaware of how much is hidden.

75
00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:30,911
A large portion of what we manage can't be measured, and not realizing this has unintended

76
00:03:30,972 --> 00:03:31,492
consequences."

77
00:03:31,532 --> 00:03:35,015
Now, I love this quote, but I would not recommend you guys bringing this to your boss if you

78
00:03:35,035 --> 00:03:36,556
need more time on your project.

79
00:03:37,277 --> 00:03:38,958
But there's a snippet in this quote that is critical.

80
00:03:39,078 --> 00:03:40,820
It's being unaware of how much is hidden.

81
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:45,184
So after choosing a process that makes sense for your team, then the trickier part begins.

82
00:03:45,744 --> 00:03:49,527
You have to have an acute awareness of your team's dynamics to empower them to uncover the hidden

83
00:03:49,928 --> 00:03:52,710
within this vast dark cave when you start your project.

84
00:03:53,231 --> 00:03:57,614
Usually the magic in a project is in all the nooks and crannies and you have to help enable them to find a light.

85
00:03:57,675 --> 00:03:59,096
So, how do we do it?

86
00:03:59,516 --> 00:04:01,078
I have no idea on XCOM. I really don't.

87
00:04:01,138 --> 00:04:08,064
But I can give you some two, with two very simple key takeaways that stayed true throughout XCOM.

88
00:04:08,084 --> 00:04:08,504
And also...

89
00:04:10,236 --> 00:04:13,199
Keeping them upheld throughout the project as well is part of it.

90
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:14,860
And those two keys are trust and love.

91
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:19,264
Now, you guys all came to the video game industry probably because you have your own love story

92
00:04:19,324 --> 00:04:21,666
with this awesome interactive medium when you were young.

93
00:04:22,086 --> 00:04:23,867
So that to me is the easier part.

94
00:04:24,753 --> 00:04:27,553
But the trust is more what I wanted to focus on.

95
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:30,534
And when I was sort of given the opportunity

96
00:04:30,554 --> 00:04:32,014
to go from level design and sort of this

97
00:04:32,595 --> 00:04:34,875
junior production role into lead producer,

98
00:04:35,195 --> 00:04:36,436
the very first thing I wanted to do

99
00:04:36,496 --> 00:04:37,856
was sit down with each of the leads

100
00:04:38,156 --> 00:04:40,596
and ask them simply, how can I make your job easier?

101
00:04:40,676 --> 00:04:42,237
I didn't want to prescribe anything to them.

102
00:04:42,257 --> 00:04:44,137
And frankly, I couldn't, because I wanted to learn

103
00:04:44,177 --> 00:04:45,738
from these very awesome senior guys.

104
00:04:46,198 --> 00:04:48,018
But I think that helped set the tone with them

105
00:04:48,618 --> 00:04:50,619
that this is an environment where I want to support you.

106
00:04:50,779 --> 00:04:52,119
And I want to have an ongoing relationship

107
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:53,900
with you guys to have an environment

108
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,680
where we can find success.

109
00:04:54,940 --> 00:05:01,022
together. So the trust mechanics are not something that I knew about when I

110
00:05:01,082 --> 00:05:05,944
started out on this franchise back in 2009, but looking back in it, sort of in

111
00:05:06,044 --> 00:05:11,467
retrospect, our process has changed a lot. Those process elements that I spouted

112
00:05:11,527 --> 00:05:15,068
off at the beginning of this, we've tried little tidbits of each of those, we've

113
00:05:15,088 --> 00:05:18,750
tried, you know, poker planning and agile fall and anything you can think of, and

114
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,771
we're still experimenting today. That's always going to change as you talk to

115
00:05:21,811 --> 00:05:22,171
your team.

116
00:05:22,992 --> 00:05:24,936
But there's a few elements that have stayed true

117
00:05:25,236 --> 00:05:26,539
throughout XCOM's production.

118
00:05:27,501 --> 00:05:29,084
And I sort of see this as a machination.

119
00:05:29,265 --> 00:05:31,008
These are gears and cogs that work together

120
00:05:31,028 --> 00:05:31,770
in the different elements.

121
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:32,631
You want to love the vision.

122
00:05:33,463 --> 00:05:35,904
love your support structure, and hear your community.

123
00:05:36,465 --> 00:05:39,065
So we'll talk about each one of these a little bit.

124
00:05:39,466 --> 00:05:42,927
If you do these things, I think success will follow.

125
00:05:42,947 --> 00:05:44,267
Of course you need individual hard work,

126
00:05:44,307 --> 00:05:46,668
but these are the dynamics holding the team together.

127
00:05:47,108 --> 00:05:48,949
So trust mechanic number one, love the vision.

128
00:05:48,969 --> 00:05:50,849
You guys all know what a vision is.

129
00:05:51,049 --> 00:05:51,990
You must have a vision.

130
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,210
Our vision, like most, took.

131
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:54,771
some time to find.

132
00:05:55,171 --> 00:05:57,612
This is our shell screen, I believe in 2007, 2008,

133
00:05:58,053 --> 00:06:00,674
with one of our early gameplay prototypes.

134
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,795
And if you guys went to my art director's talk

135
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:06,077
on Monday, Greg Furch, he did a really, really great

136
00:06:06,137 --> 00:06:09,599
deep dive on this initiative that he and the lead designer

137
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:12,260
worked with 10 artists before they had any engineers

138
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,101
to sort of find what the gameplay

139
00:06:14,121 --> 00:06:15,262
of XCOM Enemy Unknown would be.

140
00:06:16,403 --> 00:06:18,626
Greg, I apologize for this screenshot if you're here.

141
00:06:18,927 --> 00:06:22,231
I didn't get that approved by you, but I'm trying to make a point that the vision can

142
00:06:22,251 --> 00:06:23,573
be murky up front sometimes.

143
00:06:24,715 --> 00:06:27,859
If you look on paper, this looked like a really poor production initiative.

144
00:06:27,939 --> 00:06:31,464
We're sinking dozens of man months into something that we know is not going to ship.

145
00:06:32,165 --> 00:06:36,127
But what in fact it allowed them to do was to make mistakes early and to uncover the hidden,

146
00:06:36,667 --> 00:06:37,608
to start finding things.

147
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:40,929
So the fog of war change, the visibility system, the camera logic,

148
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:43,390
how the soldiers worked with the UI and the action points,

149
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,931
all of these things were found in a relatively cost-effective way up front

150
00:06:47,271 --> 00:06:48,972
that would have been catastrophic on the back end.

151
00:06:49,072 --> 00:06:50,793
And it allowed the team to sort of find their way.

152
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,611
As we rolled on into production,

153
00:06:53,651 --> 00:06:55,992
these are two screenshots of our glam cams.

154
00:06:56,492 --> 00:06:59,034
And we took elements from that gameplay pre-visualization

155
00:06:59,334 --> 00:07:00,875
and actually executed on them in the game.

156
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,296
You would think once that vision starts getting found,

157
00:07:03,316 --> 00:07:04,957
then intuitively it's easy to maintain,

158
00:07:05,017 --> 00:07:07,418
but you always have to keep that trust

159
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:08,518
between disciplines going,

160
00:07:08,538 --> 00:07:10,699
because you're gonna have some problems

161
00:07:10,719 --> 00:07:12,280
when actual implementation happens,

162
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,461
where it's not as beautiful as that gameplay previs.

163
00:07:14,921 --> 00:07:16,182
And the rubber met the road quite a bit.

164
00:07:17,022 --> 00:07:22,226
We often fell back on a studio-wide mantra when we were having conflict between disciplines that,

165
00:07:22,686 --> 00:07:26,829
you know, I say conflict, but they worked so well together because they understood what was driving our community.

166
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:31,072
At Firaxis, for all our projects, we think gameplay first, or gameplay experience first.

167
00:07:32,133 --> 00:07:37,336
pillars on XCOM 2 that Greg and our team drove was making a strategy game feel

168
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:41,818
more action-oriented, but when that presentation layer started stomping on

169
00:07:41,838 --> 00:07:45,320
the gameplay mechanics and the understandability of the depth of our

170
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,841
mechanics and the interesting decisions and what was happening, which is what our

171
00:07:47,861 --> 00:07:51,343
community wants, then he was able to work with design and find that happy middle ground.

172
00:07:53,044 --> 00:07:55,665
So the second mechanic is a multi-cog approach.

173
00:07:55,925 --> 00:07:57,625
This is love your support structure.

174
00:07:57,645 --> 00:07:59,345
And I say support structure because you have your team,

175
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:00,345
which everyone knows about,

176
00:08:00,725 --> 00:08:02,326
but then you also have your external partners.

177
00:08:02,526 --> 00:08:04,886
And that can be an investor, that can be a publisher.

178
00:08:05,326 --> 00:08:06,987
And I think it can really be understated

179
00:08:07,067 --> 00:08:09,087
that you want to have a very strong relationship

180
00:08:09,127 --> 00:08:10,867
with the people funding your vision.

181
00:08:11,327 --> 00:08:13,908
We're very lucky to have a relationship with 2K Games,

182
00:08:14,288 --> 00:08:16,288
and it started out on an excellent footing

183
00:08:16,328 --> 00:08:18,629
because they believed in a turn-based strategy game

184
00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:19,789
and giving it AAA support.

185
00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:21,950
which is critical.

186
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,671
And then day to day, we have had a completely

187
00:08:24,711 --> 00:08:26,072
transparent relationship with them

188
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:27,512
when design changes are happening,

189
00:08:28,093 --> 00:08:29,713
when they need to see where we're at with the schedule.

190
00:08:30,154 --> 00:08:32,815
I often hear stories from colleagues in the industry

191
00:08:32,835 --> 00:08:35,016
where their instinct is to hide information

192
00:08:35,136 --> 00:08:35,996
from an external partner.

193
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,497
And they're doing that to protect the team,

194
00:08:37,937 --> 00:08:40,058
but to me that's indicative of a longer term problem

195
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,299
where you want to have an open, transparent relationship

196
00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:44,881
and make them understand the reality of game development

197
00:08:44,961 --> 00:08:46,581
and 2K has been phenomenal with that.

198
00:08:49,184 --> 00:08:50,485
So the next cog is your team.

199
00:08:50,505 --> 00:08:52,526
And this can be sort of its own presentation,

200
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:53,787
but we don't have a ton of time.

201
00:08:53,827 --> 00:08:56,309
So these are the guys and gals that execute on the vision.

202
00:08:56,349 --> 00:08:58,771
And I wanted to just show a few pictures.

203
00:08:59,271 --> 00:09:00,872
Before I joined for Access, I was at Carnegie Mellon,

204
00:09:00,892 --> 00:09:01,533
like Grant said.

205
00:09:02,133 --> 00:09:04,875
And our advisor, Jesse Schell, would often

206
00:09:04,935 --> 00:09:07,417
say the success of a student project

207
00:09:07,737 --> 00:09:09,939
could be reflected in their joy and their interaction

208
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:10,779
in a candid photo.

209
00:09:10,819 --> 00:09:12,681
He said there was a direct correlation between that

210
00:09:13,361 --> 00:09:15,503
and then a project team that looked like they

211
00:09:15,543 --> 00:09:16,543
didn't want to work together.

212
00:09:17,044 --> 00:09:18,184
We made this roughshod.

213
00:09:18,845 --> 00:09:23,631
Terrible student prototype that blossomed into an IGF winner and you can see we really enjoy working together

214
00:09:24,011 --> 00:09:26,494
We still like go to this picture every year and talk about hey

215
00:09:26,514 --> 00:09:27,315
We need to reunite

216
00:09:27,655 --> 00:09:31,140
There was a lot of trust and love between us and we wanted to get our get each other's backs

217
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,962
We were terrified of letting each other down

218
00:09:34,063 --> 00:09:37,024
And I'm lucky to sort of have that microcosm from CMU

219
00:09:37,104 --> 00:09:40,345
and see that blown to a studio-wide culture at Firaxis,

220
00:09:40,425 --> 00:09:43,286
where every single project there is this high standard,

221
00:09:43,386 --> 00:09:45,387
and we have teammates that don't want to let each other down.

222
00:09:45,827 --> 00:09:49,568
These are pictures from the team back in the mid-2000s,

223
00:09:49,728 --> 00:09:51,249
and all these folks are still with the company.

224
00:09:51,609 --> 00:09:53,390
I think we have over a 60 percent attrition rate

225
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:56,191
on the XCOM team from one inception over a decade ago,

226
00:09:56,211 --> 00:09:58,471
which is great in any industry, let alone game development,

227
00:09:58,851 --> 00:10:00,632
and it's really indicative of the culture that we have there.

228
00:10:00,992 --> 00:10:02,333
Sometimes conflict happens, but hey.

229
00:10:02,793 --> 00:10:04,174
You gotta tough love your teammates once in a while.

230
00:10:04,995 --> 00:10:07,097
So not everything is always gonna be hunky-dory.

231
00:10:07,257 --> 00:10:08,858
Of course, you'll have team members get lost,

232
00:10:09,739 --> 00:10:10,620
and they'll lose sight of the vision,

233
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,241
and it's the producer's job to champion that

234
00:10:12,281 --> 00:10:13,242
and get them back on track.

235
00:10:13,742 --> 00:10:15,224
That happened often on Enemy Unknown,

236
00:10:15,264 --> 00:10:17,105
and we did some non-publisher-driven milestones

237
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,346
to get levels back on track,

238
00:10:18,867 --> 00:10:21,189
and then we parlayed concepts like that into XCOM 2

239
00:10:21,229 --> 00:10:22,450
with this idea of goalposts.

240
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,511
It's essentially epics in producer speak,

241
00:10:24,552 --> 00:10:25,873
but what we did was we made them

242
00:10:25,953 --> 00:10:27,614
very, very visible and transparent.

243
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:29,155
We laid out over the course.

244
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:33,198
sorry about that, of multiple years on our War Room whiteboard

245
00:10:33,598 --> 00:10:35,459
what the content team was going to drive towards.

246
00:10:35,859 --> 00:10:37,840
And not only did they hit it, but they exceeded it.

247
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,762
We actually shipped an entirely new environment set

248
00:10:40,942 --> 00:10:41,823
than what we had planned.

249
00:10:42,243 --> 00:10:44,024
And we got a lot of feedback from them after the fact

250
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:45,325
that they liked how visible these were

251
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:47,166
and that these were not buried away in some backlog

252
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:48,706
that only a few producers would see.

253
00:10:50,187 --> 00:10:51,588
So it was really a good initiative.

254
00:10:51,648 --> 00:10:53,189
It didn't work as well for design and tech

255
00:10:53,649 --> 00:10:56,031
because the acceptance criteria there is a lot more murky

256
00:10:56,191 --> 00:10:57,472
and nebulous and prone to change.

257
00:10:58,052 --> 00:11:00,014
So we had one-off design cabals with them

258
00:11:00,374 --> 00:11:01,475
to help them find their way,

259
00:11:01,935 --> 00:11:04,176
to have more actionable items quicker,

260
00:11:04,637 --> 00:11:06,798
and then we would grow those into playthroughs,

261
00:11:06,978 --> 00:11:08,779
which I would highly recommend using.

262
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:10,080
You have to use them conservatively, though,

263
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,522
because there's key times in the schedule where it's...

264
00:11:14,243 --> 00:11:17,789
It's appropriate to use them as all the systems are converging and all the content's coming in.

265
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:20,113
It's going to be buggy and messy as hell up front.

266
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:24,320
And you want that team to feel a little bit of that pain, so then you can see day over day,

267
00:11:25,141 --> 00:11:28,086
it improves and you guys sort of uncover the hidden together and find the fun.

268
00:11:30,599 --> 00:11:32,820
Okay, I'm gonna make this a little bit shorter,

269
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,440
but this is a topic I'm really passionate about.

270
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,121
Crunch is big in the industry as producers

271
00:11:37,161 --> 00:11:39,502
and the owners of the time were responsible

272
00:11:39,722 --> 00:11:41,482
for the outcome of that if you do crunch.

273
00:11:42,203 --> 00:11:43,603
Xcom put in a lot of extra hours,

274
00:11:43,643 --> 00:11:44,863
and I'm not gonna say we didn't crunch,

275
00:11:44,903 --> 00:11:47,684
but we did want to respect what drives others.

276
00:11:47,884 --> 00:11:49,865
I've talked a lot about vision, about vision execution,

277
00:11:49,885 --> 00:11:52,826
and I think those are the most important thing,

278
00:11:52,866 --> 00:11:53,966
but they shouldn't come at the cost

279
00:11:54,306 --> 00:11:55,527
of spitting your team out for dead.

280
00:11:55,987 --> 00:11:57,347
You have to be aware of the team health

281
00:11:57,407 --> 00:11:58,588
and figure out how to manage that.

282
00:11:59,168 --> 00:12:00,268
We had some ways of doing that.

283
00:12:00,348 --> 00:12:02,509
I'll be happy to talk about with people afterwards

284
00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:04,970
where we had sort of a tailored extra hour approach

285
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:06,570
where we got the buy-in from individuals

286
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:07,611
after we balance loaded.

287
00:12:07,931 --> 00:12:11,012
We made them aware of the why we were asking for more work

288
00:12:11,452 --> 00:12:12,372
and managed it that way.

289
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:15,493
So the last trust mechanic is community,

290
00:12:15,753 --> 00:12:17,416
and community is everything.

291
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:18,577
They're your pillar beneficiary,

292
00:12:19,479 --> 00:12:21,161
the recipient of everything that you've worked to build,

293
00:12:21,181 --> 00:12:22,724
and you want to maintain a relationship with them

294
00:12:22,764 --> 00:12:24,887
after you ship, especially in this day and age now, too,

295
00:12:24,907 --> 00:12:27,651
where there's more ways to communicate with them.

296
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:28,853
You want that community to grow.

297
00:12:29,393 --> 00:12:32,056
But if you notice, I say hear your community and not listen to your community.

298
00:12:32,556 --> 00:12:35,099
It's very easy to design by community.

299
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:36,760
And we want that information.

300
00:12:36,821 --> 00:12:40,604
After Enemy Unknown, we actually aggregated all of their feedback that was trending on

301
00:12:40,624 --> 00:12:42,066
the top forums and the top reviews.

302
00:12:42,446 --> 00:12:45,769
And we made design aware of that feedback, but it did not drive our design pillars for

303
00:12:45,789 --> 00:12:46,109
XCOM 2.

304
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,131
It was just part of the informational process.

305
00:12:49,507 --> 00:12:51,811
So, these are XCOM's trust mechanics.

306
00:12:51,891 --> 00:12:54,055
Love the vision, love your support structure,

307
00:12:54,455 --> 00:12:55,337
and hear your community.

308
00:12:55,617 --> 00:12:57,761
These are ultimately what allowed us to light up our cave

309
00:12:58,001 --> 00:12:59,203
with a thousand bonfires.

310
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:01,266
How will you light yours?

311
00:13:01,827 --> 00:13:02,048
Thank you.

312
00:13:08,077 --> 00:13:08,637
Thank you, Garth.

313
00:13:08,857 --> 00:13:09,278
Thank you.

314
00:13:09,298 --> 00:13:10,838
All right, so we're gonna do something

315
00:13:10,878 --> 00:13:12,899
that may be a little awkward for some of you.

316
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:14,819
This comes from Scott Crabtree.

317
00:13:14,859 --> 00:13:16,460
By the way, he has a talk tomorrow at three o'clock.

318
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,261
I recommend you go to, because he is amazing.

319
00:13:18,781 --> 00:13:19,141
Nice plug.

320
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:21,742
Okay, so if you're willing and able, please stand up.

321
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:23,202
That's now.

322
00:13:23,382 --> 00:13:24,763
This is the part where you stand up.

323
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,643
I know it's Thursday.

324
00:13:25,683 --> 00:13:27,544
If this was Friday, I would not ask you to stand up.

325
00:13:28,364 --> 00:13:31,485
Find your nearest partner and talk for 30 seconds each

326
00:13:31,665 --> 00:13:33,245
about what you just learned from Garth's talk.

327
00:13:39,307 --> 00:13:39,927
That was excellent.

328
00:13:39,947 --> 00:13:40,448
Thanks man.

329
00:13:46,536 --> 00:13:48,598
Let's do the thing with your hands where you're talking.

330
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:52,343
Last year the photographer came in during this part and we got amazing pictures because

331
00:13:52,383 --> 00:13:52,884
we're all like...

332
00:13:53,104 --> 00:13:54,506
Blah blah blah.

333
00:13:54,546 --> 00:13:55,067
Blah blah blah.

334
00:13:55,147 --> 00:13:55,707
Blah blah blah.

335
00:14:25,514 --> 00:14:31,598
Alright, alright, alright, alright.

336
00:14:32,379 --> 00:14:33,699
Everyone sit back down.

337
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:36,821
Don't worry, don't worry.

338
00:14:37,522 --> 00:14:38,122
Stop talking.

339
00:14:38,322 --> 00:14:38,783
You in the back.

340
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:42,447
Time's up.

341
00:14:42,667 --> 00:14:43,048
Time's up.

342
00:14:43,468 --> 00:14:43,748
Don't worry.

343
00:14:43,768 --> 00:14:45,410
You'll get to talk to each other more, I promise.

344
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:46,350
I promise.

345
00:14:46,971 --> 00:14:48,092
And now you have new friends.

346
00:14:48,712 --> 00:14:50,694
You can go to the bar later and talk about this even more.

347
00:14:50,874 --> 00:14:52,296
I promise there will be more time to talk.

348
00:14:53,697 --> 00:14:55,218
But next up, we have Oksana.

349
00:14:55,579 --> 00:14:57,480
She's going to talk to you about.

350
00:14:59,062 --> 00:15:00,503
Oh, that was the wrong thing to say.

351
00:15:00,563 --> 00:15:02,383
Anyways, she is the development director

352
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,843
at Riot Games, heading up the platform group.

353
00:15:04,943 --> 00:15:07,424
She has 10 years of experience in the industry

354
00:15:07,544 --> 00:15:09,784
as an engineer, and five years in production,

355
00:15:09,844 --> 00:15:11,845
so she made a pretty cool switch, so Oksana.

356
00:15:13,925 --> 00:15:15,246
Hi guys.

357
00:15:15,866 --> 00:15:16,086
Hello.

358
00:15:16,246 --> 00:15:17,206
Thank you.

359
00:15:18,486 --> 00:15:18,806
Hi.

360
00:15:21,207 --> 00:15:22,207
How awesome, I love this.

361
00:15:23,472 --> 00:15:25,513
All right, so I'll be talking about

362
00:15:25,673 --> 00:15:27,014
high performance team culture,

363
00:15:27,174 --> 00:15:28,716
and I'll give you four tips today.

364
00:15:29,776 --> 00:15:31,938
These are the tips that actually come from

365
00:15:31,978 --> 00:15:34,180
my own experience, something that worked for me in the past.

366
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:37,382
I find those to be very easy to understand,

367
00:15:37,462 --> 00:15:38,423
but very effective.

368
00:15:39,304 --> 00:15:40,385
And so I'll jump right in.

369
00:15:41,085 --> 00:15:42,987
And the first tip, the first tip of the day

370
00:15:43,167 --> 00:15:44,227
is start with the why.

371
00:15:45,389 --> 00:15:48,177
When we talk about high performance on teams,

372
00:15:48,377 --> 00:15:49,841
we usually talk about motivation.

373
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:51,846
So what drives motivation?

374
00:15:51,906 --> 00:15:54,152
What drives people to perform highly?

375
00:15:55,259 --> 00:15:57,681
And it's an interesting question.

376
00:15:57,701 --> 00:15:59,522
I remember when I was interviewing at Microsoft

377
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,764
about like five years ago, I think,

378
00:16:02,665 --> 00:16:03,506
the interviewer asked me,

379
00:16:03,526 --> 00:16:06,048
like how do you motivate teams through crunch time?

380
00:16:07,069 --> 00:16:09,951
And I was just switching to production at the time

381
00:16:10,231 --> 00:16:11,352
and I thought about it and I'm like,

382
00:16:11,813 --> 00:16:14,955
well, I buy pizza and donuts

383
00:16:15,155 --> 00:16:16,316
and I hope they feel better about it.

384
00:16:17,357 --> 00:16:18,878
So my interview didn't go well.

385
00:16:20,276 --> 00:16:23,417
But my thinking evolved since then,

386
00:16:23,517 --> 00:16:27,679
and so I read the book by Daniel Pink about drive.

387
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:31,120
And in that book he says there are three primary motivators,

388
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,520
two primary drivers for motivation.

389
00:16:33,501 --> 00:16:37,402
And it's purpose, autonomy, and mastery.

390
00:16:37,642 --> 00:16:38,923
Purpose, autonomy, and mastery.

391
00:16:39,543 --> 00:16:40,964
And so the sense of purpose

392
00:16:41,364 --> 00:16:43,484
is probably the strongest way to motivate people.

393
00:16:44,345 --> 00:16:50,376
And the way I mean this is when you have a team comprised of individuals whose sense

394
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:55,987
of their own internal purpose is aligned with your why for the team, it's a very powerful

395
00:16:56,007 --> 00:16:56,528
combination.

396
00:16:57,432 --> 00:16:59,292
I'll give you an example of how this works on my team.

397
00:16:59,772 --> 00:17:01,333
I'm heading a platform team.

398
00:17:02,133 --> 00:17:04,454
And we're doing stuff that's generally

399
00:17:04,494 --> 00:17:05,675
considered not very sexy.

400
00:17:05,755 --> 00:17:06,835
I personally think it's sexy.

401
00:17:06,855 --> 00:17:10,016
But it's like installers, patchers, servers,

402
00:17:10,456 --> 00:17:13,637
localization, all this stuff that is not the actual game

403
00:17:13,677 --> 00:17:14,118
development.

404
00:17:14,718 --> 00:17:18,121
And so when I try to motivate people to work on my team,

405
00:17:18,321 --> 00:17:19,423
it sometimes is hard.

406
00:17:20,223 --> 00:17:22,385
But I have this guy on my team, his name is Michael.

407
00:17:22,846 --> 00:17:25,549
And I talk to him about why he works on my team

408
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:26,610
and he gave me this story.

409
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,492
He actually used to be a teacher

410
00:17:29,012 --> 00:17:32,095
and he one day noticed a kid in his class.

411
00:17:33,036 --> 00:17:37,080
The kid was like super unhappy, he was very shy, very...

412
00:17:38,742 --> 00:17:40,784
Like, nobody would even talk to the kid.

413
00:17:41,785 --> 00:17:43,787
And Michael decided to help him.

414
00:17:44,468 --> 00:17:46,651
So he sat down with the kid, and for the next couple of

415
00:17:46,711 --> 00:17:48,613
weeks, he showed him how to make a game.

416
00:17:48,973 --> 00:17:50,355
So they made this little game together.

417
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:53,558
And then this kid brought it and showed it to the classmates.

418
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:59,307
Overnight, he became from like a total pariah, somebody who nobody would even talk to,

419
00:17:59,667 --> 00:18:01,450
to the most popular kid in the class.

420
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:08,360
And so Michael changed this kid's life by helping him with making this game.

421
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:11,642
And so when Michael works on a platform team,

422
00:18:11,962 --> 00:18:14,504
he actually does that for other people,

423
00:18:14,704 --> 00:18:17,585
help them focus on building the game and creative side of it

424
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,966
by taking all of this other stuff away.

425
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:22,047
And he does that because it aligns

426
00:18:22,107 --> 00:18:25,629
with his own sense of purpose, what gives him fulfillment.

427
00:18:25,989 --> 00:18:27,550
So I don't have to buy him donuts

428
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:29,651
to convince him to go and work hard on my team.

429
00:18:30,011 --> 00:18:31,412
He does that because he wants to.

430
00:18:32,435 --> 00:18:34,436
So that's the tip number one, start with the why.

431
00:18:34,476 --> 00:18:37,258
Make sure you have very clearly articulated why

432
00:18:37,298 --> 00:18:40,060
for your team, but then make sure that your people

433
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:43,783
on your team actually align with that sense of why.

434
00:18:43,803 --> 00:18:45,344
So that's number one.

435
00:18:45,784 --> 00:18:48,506
Number two, define success.

436
00:18:49,487 --> 00:18:51,768
A while back my boss gave me a book,

437
00:18:52,769 --> 00:18:55,591
it was called something like On Leadership,

438
00:18:55,631 --> 00:18:57,192
How to Build Successful Organizations,

439
00:18:57,372 --> 00:18:58,453
and it was written by this guy.

440
00:18:58,493 --> 00:18:59,674
How many of you know who this guy is?

441
00:19:00,859 --> 00:19:01,399
Okay, a few.

442
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:04,242
So this is a basketball coach.

443
00:19:04,422 --> 00:19:05,903
At the time I looked at the book and I'm like,

444
00:19:06,244 --> 00:19:08,065
I don't wanna read this, I'm not into sports,

445
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,647
like why would I even read this?

446
00:19:10,248 --> 00:19:11,148
And so I looked him up.

447
00:19:11,709 --> 00:19:15,212
So this is Coach Wooden of UCLA Basketball.

448
00:19:15,873 --> 00:19:19,737
And this guy, his team won 88.

449
00:19:21,058 --> 00:19:23,360
consecutive games, 88 in a row.

450
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,843
So it's win after win after win after win,

451
00:19:26,203 --> 00:19:27,764
continuously, nonstop.

452
00:19:28,165 --> 00:19:32,089
He won 10 national championships in 12 years,

453
00:19:32,689 --> 00:19:34,091
with a record seven in a row.

454
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:36,092
Previous record is two in a row.

455
00:19:36,753 --> 00:19:39,656
So if anyone knows about performance, is this guy.

456
00:19:40,582 --> 00:19:42,803
And so, I'm like, okay, I'm gonna read this book.

457
00:19:43,303 --> 00:19:46,005
And in this book, he defines success like this.

458
00:19:46,605 --> 00:19:47,966
So I'm gonna read it, because it's very important.

459
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:49,646
I know you all can read, but I'm gonna read it anyways.

460
00:19:50,087 --> 00:19:53,248
Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result

461
00:19:53,548 --> 00:19:56,830
of self-satisfaction in knowing you did your best

462
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,271
to become the best you're capable of becoming.

463
00:20:00,231 --> 00:20:03,953
So, understanding this had a profound effect

464
00:20:04,033 --> 00:20:05,354
on how I motivate my teams,

465
00:20:05,434 --> 00:20:07,374
and how I set the goals for them.

466
00:20:08,345 --> 00:20:11,426
it's very easy to set the goals that are like external KPIs

467
00:20:11,886 --> 00:20:13,267
or metrics or targets.

468
00:20:13,747 --> 00:20:17,429
You know, your game must perform to certain Metacritic score

469
00:20:17,669 --> 00:20:19,290
or you must ship by certain date.

470
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:22,671
When you motivate people by those external kind of outcomes,

471
00:20:23,132 --> 00:20:24,933
they don't necessarily have control over that.

472
00:20:25,113 --> 00:20:28,734
And so it may drive like wrong kind of behaviors.

473
00:20:28,754 --> 00:20:30,335
I don't know if you guys know about,

474
00:20:30,555 --> 00:20:33,657
Wells Fargo recently fired like 5,000 people

475
00:20:34,177 --> 00:20:35,898
because they were creating all these shadow accounts

476
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:37,278
because their KPI was...

477
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:40,079
how many accounts they sell in a given time frame.

478
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:41,780
So you don't want that kind of behavior.

479
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,041
What you want is your teams to continuously

480
00:20:44,081 --> 00:20:47,542
and relentlessly compete against themselves.

481
00:20:47,822 --> 00:20:50,743
One of the probably most weird conversations

482
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:52,343
I had at Riot when I joined,

483
00:20:53,123 --> 00:20:54,824
when we were talking about releasing some feature,

484
00:20:55,744 --> 00:20:57,505
And I said, well, we should look up

485
00:20:57,565 --> 00:20:58,525
how the competitors do it.

486
00:20:59,085 --> 00:21:00,666
And the guys look at me like, competitors?

487
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:02,827
We don't compete against people.

488
00:21:03,067 --> 00:21:05,448
We're actually focusing on trying to do the best thing

489
00:21:05,768 --> 00:21:06,888
for the player right now.

490
00:21:07,509 --> 00:21:08,709
And so that just blew my mind.

491
00:21:08,869 --> 00:21:11,110
But that's a really good way to motivate teams

492
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:13,811
to focus on continuously improving

493
00:21:13,971 --> 00:21:15,032
and competing against themselves.

494
00:21:15,492 --> 00:21:16,412
And so my tip number two.

495
00:21:17,512 --> 00:21:19,613
Tip number three, we talked a little bit about trust.

496
00:21:21,754 --> 00:21:23,475
We all know that there is no high performance

497
00:21:23,495 --> 00:21:24,275
without trust, right?

498
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,442
And in fact, Patrick Linceoni, in his book,

499
00:21:28,862 --> 00:21:30,223
The Five Dysfunctions of a Team,

500
00:21:30,943 --> 00:21:34,325
says that absence of trust is probably the most foundational,

501
00:21:34,345 --> 00:21:35,726
the most common dysfunction on team.

502
00:21:36,106 --> 00:21:37,807
By the way, if you haven't read this book,

503
00:21:38,367 --> 00:21:39,928
please go read it.

504
00:21:40,228 --> 00:21:42,470
It's a foundational must read for every producer out there.

505
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,042
But building trust, it's easy to say,

506
00:21:46,082 --> 00:21:47,343
of course we've gotta build trust,

507
00:21:47,443 --> 00:21:48,384
but what does it mean?

508
00:21:48,544 --> 00:21:49,705
It's a hard thing to do.

509
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:52,128
And I'm here to tell you it's not a hard thing to do.

510
00:21:52,328 --> 00:21:54,089
I'm an engineer, I love formulas.

511
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:56,211
I'm gonna give you a super simple formula

512
00:21:56,531 --> 00:21:57,452
to build trust on a team.

513
00:21:57,652 --> 00:21:57,993
You ready?

514
00:21:58,854 --> 00:21:59,034
Yes?

515
00:22:00,324 --> 00:22:00,584
Yes?

516
00:22:01,345 --> 00:22:02,125
Yes, okay.

517
00:22:02,825 --> 00:22:03,266
There you go.

518
00:22:03,866 --> 00:22:04,446
Done, boom.

519
00:22:05,027 --> 00:22:06,087
So, trust equation.

520
00:22:06,147 --> 00:22:07,968
Trust is credibility, reliability,

521
00:22:08,008 --> 00:22:09,909
intimacy over self-orientation.

522
00:22:09,989 --> 00:22:12,911
Credibility is you have the experience

523
00:22:13,091 --> 00:22:16,032
and the knowledge about what you're talking about,

524
00:22:16,072 --> 00:22:17,333
so I can trust you on a subject.

525
00:22:17,773 --> 00:22:19,374
Reliability is I can trust you

526
00:22:19,654 --> 00:22:21,035
to do what you say you're going to do.

527
00:22:21,775 --> 00:22:23,756
Intimacy is I can trust you with my secrets

528
00:22:23,836 --> 00:22:25,477
and that you're not gonna tell somebody else

529
00:22:25,537 --> 00:22:26,298
about these secrets,

530
00:22:26,818 --> 00:22:28,519
or you're going to kind of use them against me.

531
00:22:29,501 --> 00:22:31,766
But all of that is charmed by self-orientation.

532
00:22:31,926 --> 00:22:33,309
If I for a second believe.

533
00:22:34,304 --> 00:22:37,226
that you're acting in your own interest and not in mine.

534
00:22:37,947 --> 00:22:39,568
I will not trust you, no matter how credible,

535
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:42,590
how reliable, or how trustworthy you are.

536
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:43,811
I will not trust you.

537
00:22:44,651 --> 00:22:47,413
And this works, this is a super powerful formula

538
00:22:47,433 --> 00:22:49,274
that works from a team, individual level,

539
00:22:49,354 --> 00:22:50,915
all the way to organizations.

540
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,817
On a team level, it works like this, it looks like this.

541
00:22:54,198 --> 00:22:57,520
An engineer goes, hey, I really like this system.

542
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,822
I really love this system and I wanna work on this,

543
00:23:00,182 --> 00:23:01,943
but my team needs me to focus here.

544
00:23:02,684 --> 00:23:06,467
So I'm going to put this down, my pet project, my love child,

545
00:23:06,887 --> 00:23:10,470
and I'm going to focus on what the team needs me to do right now.

546
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:14,173
And so he's sacrificing his own self-interest for the interest of the team.

547
00:23:15,113 --> 00:23:17,736
And then when other people see that, they start doing the same thing,

548
00:23:17,776 --> 00:23:19,317
and the next thing you know, magic happens.

549
00:23:20,312 --> 00:23:21,873
And the same thing works all the way

550
00:23:21,893 --> 00:23:23,173
to an organizational level.

551
00:23:23,714 --> 00:23:26,856
So at Riot, we made this our fundamental principle.

552
00:23:26,896 --> 00:23:28,517
The mission of the entire company

553
00:23:29,017 --> 00:23:31,819
is to aspire to be the most player-focused company

554
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:32,599
in the world.

555
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,821
And that means that we have players' trust

556
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:37,482
because no matter mistakes,

557
00:23:37,702 --> 00:23:39,043
and we make a lot of mistakes,

558
00:23:39,123 --> 00:23:41,684
but the mistakes we make, players know and forgive us

559
00:23:42,165 --> 00:23:43,606
because they think and they know

560
00:23:43,646 --> 00:23:46,247
that we have their interests at heart first and foremost.

561
00:23:46,928 --> 00:23:48,048
And it has to be genuine too.

562
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:50,451
So that was my tip number three.

563
00:23:51,232 --> 00:23:53,334
My tip number four, and the final tip,

564
00:23:53,454 --> 00:23:56,497
is distort reality just a little bit.

565
00:23:56,818 --> 00:23:57,498
What does this mean?

566
00:23:58,399 --> 00:24:00,281
You, you know this guy is pretty famous

567
00:24:00,301 --> 00:24:01,522
for distortion of reality.

568
00:24:02,783 --> 00:24:04,705
But what I mean here is it's going back

569
00:24:04,765 --> 00:24:05,806
to that sense of trust.

570
00:24:07,346 --> 00:24:12,529
It's when you walk on the team and you want to build this high performance culture, you don't go and tell them

571
00:24:12,589 --> 00:24:17,152
Hey guys, we're gonna be high performing team. So let's all focus and do this instead

572
00:24:17,212 --> 00:24:22,416
What you want to do is you want to act and talk as if they're already there

573
00:24:23,016 --> 00:24:25,858
You pretend, but then you believe in your mind deeply

574
00:24:26,138 --> 00:24:28,120
that your people are the best people you have,

575
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,741
that they're bright, that they're brilliant,

576
00:24:29,861 --> 00:24:32,023
and they can and will get there.

577
00:24:32,423 --> 00:24:33,784
And then you just talk to them that way.

578
00:24:34,545 --> 00:24:37,867
There's this very funny kind of experiment that was done.

579
00:24:37,947 --> 00:24:39,669
I was really surprised by the outcomes of this.

580
00:24:40,189 --> 00:24:43,211
So they took a set of rats, same kind of rats,

581
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:44,913
and they separated it into two sets.

582
00:24:45,473 --> 00:24:47,875
And they gave one set to one set of experimenters

583
00:24:47,955 --> 00:24:48,836
and the other set to another.

584
00:24:49,016 --> 00:24:52,038
Said, these rats are stupid, these rats are smart.

585
00:24:53,214 --> 00:24:55,015
and they had them run the rats through a labyrinth

586
00:24:55,075 --> 00:24:57,076
and measure how fast the rats would finish.

587
00:24:57,857 --> 00:25:00,259
The people who believe their rats are smart

588
00:25:00,979 --> 00:25:02,700
actually had much better results

589
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,642
than the people who believe their rats are stupid.

590
00:25:05,762 --> 00:25:07,444
Same type of rats, so weird.

591
00:25:07,784 --> 00:25:09,405
And so they looked into it and it turns out

592
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:11,206
that people who believe their rats are smart,

593
00:25:11,586 --> 00:25:14,869
they actually treated them a little bit with more TLC.

594
00:25:14,989 --> 00:25:16,210
They gave them little snacks,

595
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,651
they encouraged them a little bit more,

596
00:25:17,711 --> 00:25:19,992
they petted them, and so rats perform better.

597
00:25:20,072 --> 00:25:20,613
Like holy shit.

598
00:25:22,953 --> 00:25:25,194
And now, if that's how it works for rats,

599
00:25:26,554 --> 00:25:28,595
imagine what it does for people.

600
00:25:29,636 --> 00:25:31,296
When you genuinely believe in your people,

601
00:25:31,577 --> 00:25:33,878
just imagine the results you can accomplish.

602
00:25:34,878 --> 00:25:37,619
And that's the distortion of reality.

603
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,501
And so, this is the recommended list

604
00:25:42,621 --> 00:25:45,042
that some of the books that I use in this talk.

605
00:25:45,322 --> 00:25:46,663
But before we go, before I go,

606
00:25:46,943 --> 00:25:48,924
I want to use the distortion of reality on you guys.

607
00:25:49,413 --> 00:25:50,153
Okay, are you ready?

608
00:25:51,054 --> 00:25:51,915
Everybody's taking pictures.

609
00:25:52,615 --> 00:25:52,996
One second.

610
00:25:53,936 --> 00:25:56,238
Okay, so I'm gonna use the distortion of reality on you.

611
00:25:57,079 --> 00:25:59,761
In this audience, we are all, of course,

612
00:25:59,801 --> 00:26:01,982
the type of people that fill out GDC surveys.

613
00:26:03,143 --> 00:26:04,304
So when we walk out of here,

614
00:26:04,344 --> 00:26:05,645
when we receive our results back,

615
00:26:05,825 --> 00:26:07,907
we will have 100% completion rate.

616
00:26:08,207 --> 00:26:08,427
Yes?

617
00:26:09,448 --> 00:26:10,208
Yes, thank you.

618
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:12,950
Thank you.

619
00:26:13,651 --> 00:26:14,291
Thank you, Oksana.

620
00:26:14,311 --> 00:26:14,672
Thank you, Oksana.

621
00:26:15,172 --> 00:26:15,372
Well.

622
00:26:16,948 --> 00:26:21,630
my friends, it's come to that time again. Clearly you all enjoyed this. So once again, stand up

623
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:24,511
and chat about what you've learned from Oxana.

624
00:26:34,932 --> 00:26:35,272
No, it's amazing.

625
00:26:35,292 --> 00:26:35,713
Come on, man, you do it.

626
00:26:35,733 --> 00:26:36,293
I'm gonna be alone next time.

627
00:26:36,313 --> 00:26:36,654
It's not too late.

628
00:26:36,674 --> 00:26:36,854
We should.

629
00:26:36,874 --> 00:26:37,054
Yeah, yeah.

630
00:26:37,074 --> 00:26:37,154
Yeah.

631
00:26:37,174 --> 00:26:37,454
I realize that...

632
00:26:37,474 --> 00:26:37,834
I forgot one thing.

633
00:26:37,854 --> 00:26:38,715
I should have had Joel give me three points

634
00:26:38,735 --> 00:26:39,075
and a funny point.

635
00:26:58,263 --> 00:27:04,087
We did the Petra Kutra stuff on Monday and we had where you're from, what your hobbies

636
00:27:04,107 --> 00:27:09,070
are outside of games, and something that your high school friend would be amazed to know

637
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:10,051
about you.

638
00:27:10,151 --> 00:27:15,594
And I heard from Mr. Mikos that one guy was like, I sew better than my wife, and another

639
00:27:15,654 --> 00:27:17,976
guy was like, I dropped out of high school, have a GED.

640
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:18,456
Yeah, it's amazing.

641
00:27:18,476 --> 00:27:18,997
Awesome.

642
00:27:19,017 --> 00:27:19,577
Thank you.

643
00:27:19,617 --> 00:27:19,817
Thanks.

644
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:31,704
Yeah, you guys are making me feel so weird.

645
00:27:32,104 --> 00:27:32,665
We're really good on here.

646
00:27:32,685 --> 00:27:35,646
How are you feeling physically, hanging in there?

647
00:27:36,166 --> 00:27:37,307
We're at about 28 minutes.

648
00:27:37,747 --> 00:27:39,068
So, I don't know.

649
00:27:39,228 --> 00:27:39,668
That's good.

650
00:27:40,188 --> 00:27:40,889
Alright, alright.

651
00:27:41,329 --> 00:27:42,270
Alright, alright, alright.

652
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:45,071
That's why you're back there.

653
00:27:45,091 --> 00:27:46,572
Alright, alright, alright.

654
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:49,093
In the back of the room.

655
00:27:52,615 --> 00:27:52,875
Alright.

656
00:27:53,875 --> 00:27:55,636
Calm down, you crazy animals.

657
00:27:57,747 --> 00:28:03,880
Thank you. Thank you. Maybe I should announce La La Land as a winner. Maybe that'll get

658
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:04,662
everybody's attention.

659
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:06,860
All right, cool.

660
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,500
Up next is Chuck.

661
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:11,981
He is the CPO of Shell Games.

662
00:28:12,421 --> 00:28:14,402
He can tell you what CPO means, it sounds fancy.

663
00:28:15,222 --> 00:28:16,622
His background is in architecture.

664
00:28:16,802 --> 00:28:19,263
He worked on Sims 2 EP Team,

665
00:28:19,723 --> 00:28:21,603
and now works on theme park attractions

666
00:28:21,643 --> 00:28:23,924
such as Disney Toy Story Mania,

667
00:28:24,144 --> 00:28:26,404
which I got a high score on, just saying.

668
00:28:26,924 --> 00:28:30,365
To cutting edge VR and AR such as I Expect You to Die.

669
00:28:31,646 --> 00:28:34,266
Also, he is an adjunct faculty at CMU

670
00:28:34,346 --> 00:28:35,746
teaching production and leadership.

671
00:28:35,906 --> 00:28:36,247
All right, Chuck.

672
00:28:45,553 --> 00:28:48,474
I like finding sage wisdom inside of Jira.

673
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:56,400
Well said Atlassian.

674
00:29:01,248 --> 00:29:04,031
So I've been making games for a while, or what feels like a

675
00:29:04,091 --> 00:29:04,772
long time anyway.

676
00:29:05,453 --> 00:29:07,275
I've worked on dozens and dozens of games.

677
00:29:07,596 --> 00:29:09,578
And I've seen a lot of them do really well and succeed.

678
00:29:09,618 --> 00:29:11,360
And I've seen a lot of them crash and burn.

679
00:29:12,882 --> 00:29:14,884
And I'm sure most of you in this room have gone through

680
00:29:14,924 --> 00:29:17,267
those observations on different projects you've

681
00:29:17,287 --> 00:29:19,230
worked on or projects you've seen out there.

682
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:22,553
And after a while, you start trying to figure out what the

683
00:29:22,613 --> 00:29:24,914
difference is between those really successful teams and

684
00:29:24,935 --> 00:29:30,299
the ones that fail, what the impact is that informs how

685
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:31,440
those teams are going to do.

686
00:29:33,061 --> 00:29:35,883
So what I want to talk about today a little bit is teams

687
00:29:35,923 --> 00:29:39,827
that thrive, and kind of our quest at Shell Games to figure

688
00:29:39,887 --> 00:29:43,169
out what enabled those teams to thrive when others didn't,

689
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:47,433
and trying to replicate an environment to have very

690
00:29:47,473 --> 00:29:48,213
successful teams.

691
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:53,773
So I actually had a hypothesis going into this a few years

692
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:58,416
ago, and the first was that very successful teams had much

693
00:29:58,456 --> 00:30:01,538
higher morale, were happier with their vision, believed in

694
00:30:01,558 --> 00:30:03,679
their project more, and were generally

695
00:30:03,739 --> 00:30:05,060
happier working together.

696
00:30:05,761 --> 00:30:08,122
And certainly, when I say that, I mean all else being

697
00:30:08,182 --> 00:30:08,583
equal, right?

698
00:30:08,603 --> 00:30:10,584
There's plenty of things outside the team that

699
00:30:10,624 --> 00:30:12,605
contribute to the success or failure of a game that

700
00:30:12,625 --> 00:30:14,046
sometimes you don't have control over.

701
00:30:14,387 --> 00:30:17,849
But when we look just at the teams, I certainly posited that

702
00:30:17,929 --> 00:30:19,450
happier teams did better work.

703
00:30:20,746 --> 00:30:24,729
And I had a second theory that most of the teams that we

704
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:27,412
experience in the game industry have a very similar

705
00:30:27,752 --> 00:30:30,054
curve of morale over time.

706
00:30:31,175 --> 00:30:34,958
Maybe something like this, where we start off really

707
00:30:35,038 --> 00:30:37,460
early at the beginning, and there's tons of potential.

708
00:30:37,901 --> 00:30:39,642
We have the world in front of us.

709
00:30:39,762 --> 00:30:41,524
We have a prototype that feels really good.

710
00:30:42,605 --> 00:30:46,228
And then the reality starts setting in about what we have

711
00:30:46,248 --> 00:30:49,090
to build and all the crap we don't know about.

712
00:30:50,308 --> 00:30:51,489
And it gets really scary.

713
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:54,851
But then we get really good at focusing in our scope, and

714
00:30:54,871 --> 00:30:56,792
the possibility space narrows in.

715
00:30:56,812 --> 00:30:59,773
And morale starts to lift back up.

716
00:31:00,334 --> 00:31:02,335
And you get to a really good spot, and things start to come

717
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:04,316
together, and you ship your game, and you feel really good

718
00:31:04,356 --> 00:31:04,696
about it.

719
00:31:05,752 --> 00:31:07,792
And I'm sure there's slight differences in this, but I

720
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:11,273
really felt like over time, a lot of projects followed this

721
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:12,073
same curve.

722
00:31:12,493 --> 00:31:15,413
And I kind of wondered, if we could map this curve, if we

723
00:31:15,453 --> 00:31:19,734
knew this existed for multiple projects, as a studio, can we

724
00:31:20,274 --> 00:31:21,434
head it off at the past?

725
00:31:21,714 --> 00:31:24,575
Can we anticipate these dips and valleys so that we

726
00:31:24,615 --> 00:31:27,575
continue to boost the morale of the teams from the studio's

727
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:29,916
perspective so that we can reduce the

728
00:31:30,016 --> 00:31:31,256
impact of these valleys?

729
00:31:32,876 --> 00:31:33,837
So we did an experiment.

730
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:38,043
And for two years, every three weeks, I sent a survey to

731
00:31:38,083 --> 00:31:39,664
about 12 teams in our studio.

732
00:31:40,124 --> 00:31:41,626
And I asked three big questions.

733
00:31:42,426 --> 00:31:44,989
The first was to rate your project's chance for success.

734
00:31:46,097 --> 00:31:49,198
Then we asked people to rate your overall satisfaction at

735
00:31:49,238 --> 00:31:50,119
that given day.

736
00:31:50,879 --> 00:31:53,541
And then we asked people to select any number of emotional

737
00:31:53,601 --> 00:31:54,802
indicators that they wanted.

738
00:31:54,842 --> 00:31:56,303
And this is the graph we used.

739
00:31:57,123 --> 00:32:00,245
So on the vertical up and down are positive or negative

740
00:32:00,265 --> 00:32:02,966
emotions, and from left to right is kind of the intensity

741
00:32:03,067 --> 00:32:03,827
of these emotions.

742
00:32:03,907 --> 00:32:06,428
And people could go through and pick and choose.

743
00:32:07,429 --> 00:32:10,571
So I'm going to show you if I can get the mouse over here.

744
00:32:11,451 --> 00:32:11,832
Maybe.

745
00:32:11,852 --> 00:32:13,793
Yeah, all right.

746
00:32:15,925 --> 00:32:17,907
I'm going to show you what that looks like over time.

747
00:32:19,088 --> 00:32:20,869
So while this is playing, I'll just explain it.

748
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:22,791
This is just a subset of the data,

749
00:32:22,831 --> 00:32:24,952
but here's some examples of four or five teams.

750
00:32:25,733 --> 00:32:29,056
The vertical axis is their satisfaction on the project.

751
00:32:29,236 --> 00:32:30,517
Horizontal is over time.

752
00:32:30,557 --> 00:32:31,718
So there's a motion graph showing

753
00:32:32,198 --> 00:32:33,519
the duration of these projects.

754
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,061
And actually, the size of the sphere in this example

755
00:32:36,101 --> 00:32:37,703
is related to the joyful quadrant

756
00:32:37,743 --> 00:32:38,964
of those emotional indicators.

757
00:32:40,165 --> 00:32:42,126
So we got a lot of data over two years.

758
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:44,828
So what did that show us?

759
00:32:52,334 --> 00:32:55,738
Well, not a ton. It wasn't actually that useful.

760
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:03,105
The first thing, our first hypothesis, did seem to be correct.

761
00:33:03,857 --> 00:33:05,917
When we look back at our teams, we saw ones that were

762
00:33:05,937 --> 00:33:08,238
consistently higher in morale over the lifetime of their

763
00:33:08,258 --> 00:33:10,179
project were generally more successful.

764
00:33:10,219 --> 00:33:11,059
So that was cool.

765
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,400
That was kind of useful.

766
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,201
But man, there was no relationship with teams.

767
00:33:15,701 --> 00:33:19,483
That fictional curve did not seem to be replicated across

768
00:33:19,523 --> 00:33:21,464
different projects in any way.

769
00:33:22,444 --> 00:33:25,205
It was really shocking how little projects

770
00:33:25,245 --> 00:33:26,045
looked like each other.

771
00:33:28,135 --> 00:33:30,837
And what was kind of crazier is they didn't even seem to map

772
00:33:30,877 --> 00:33:32,098
to big points in the project.

773
00:33:32,138 --> 00:33:34,340
It wasn't like, oh, we had a big cut in scope here, or a

774
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,861
big shift in decisions here, or priority

775
00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:37,862
changes from the client.

776
00:33:38,363 --> 00:33:41,245
It was like teams with really high morale were consistently

777
00:33:41,265 --> 00:33:44,066
pretty high, and they ebbed and flowed seemingly randomly.

778
00:33:44,487 --> 00:33:46,468
And teams that were lower kind of did the same thing.

779
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:51,412
So a lot of our realization from this was we could

780
00:33:53,595 --> 00:33:55,476
look at the team's morale, we could track it,

781
00:33:56,437 --> 00:33:59,138
but any interventions we tried weren't super useful

782
00:33:59,158 --> 00:34:00,959
or impactful on that morale over time.

783
00:34:01,399 --> 00:34:04,060
And we realized that team morale and happiness

784
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,001
wasn't something that we could impose on the team,

785
00:34:06,041 --> 00:34:07,761
it was something that really needed to come

786
00:34:07,801 --> 00:34:09,522
from the heart of the team, from its people.

787
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:14,204
I like how we all randomly picked like four lessons

788
00:34:14,244 --> 00:34:14,884
for everybody to learn.

789
00:34:16,145 --> 00:34:16,745
Producers here.

790
00:34:19,804 --> 00:34:22,406
I always love this quote by Peter Drucker, right?

791
00:34:22,426 --> 00:34:24,568
That culture eats strategy for breakfast.

792
00:34:25,308 --> 00:34:28,511
And when we looked at teams that really thrived at RStudio,

793
00:34:28,551 --> 00:34:32,714
it wasn't because of process or schedule or best practices.

794
00:34:33,055 --> 00:34:35,136
It was kind of these cultural norms on the team.

795
00:34:35,457 --> 00:34:37,679
And not just the team leadership, but the entire team.

796
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:40,421
And when we tried to replicate those,

797
00:34:40,521 --> 00:34:43,023
we really looked at the teams that were doing really well,

798
00:34:43,043 --> 00:34:45,445
and we found kind of these four common cultural traits

799
00:34:46,146 --> 00:34:47,066
for these thriving teams.

800
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,991
So I'm going to share those next and some concrete steps

801
00:34:51,052 --> 00:34:53,133
about how you can maybe apply those to your teams.

802
00:34:54,553 --> 00:34:57,115
So the first that we noticed was our thriving teams were

803
00:34:57,155 --> 00:35:00,436
really ones that were willing to buy into a decision fully

804
00:35:00,816 --> 00:35:01,717
and then just move on.

805
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:06,525
So one of the strategies we saw time and time again is people on these teams were willing

806
00:35:06,545 --> 00:35:10,531
to be convinced of different points of view, but more so than that, they would tell each

807
00:35:10,591 --> 00:35:14,216
other specifically what would change their mind, right?

808
00:35:14,297 --> 00:35:18,362
If Garth and I are in a disagreement, it's one thing to acknowledge that I have a particular

809
00:35:18,422 --> 00:35:18,883
viewpoint.

810
00:35:19,184 --> 00:35:21,946
But these teams elevated that and were actually open with

811
00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:24,248
each other about, yeah, I don't agree with you, but

812
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,490
here's some things that would get me to agree with you.

813
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:28,412
And these may be big things, right?

814
00:35:28,432 --> 00:35:29,693
It may be building a prototype.

815
00:35:29,733 --> 00:35:31,715
It may be answering really challenging questions.

816
00:35:31,775 --> 00:35:33,877
It may be data or information that you don't have.

817
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:39,603
But going through this process made it really clear to people

818
00:35:39,663 --> 00:35:41,664
on the team that there's a culture of being open to

819
00:35:41,704 --> 00:35:44,767
changing your mind, and people were very

820
00:35:44,847 --> 00:35:45,908
willing to be convinced.

821
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,681
The second kind of almost powerful phrase

822
00:35:50,741 --> 00:35:52,262
we saw these teams reference a lot

823
00:35:52,302 --> 00:35:53,923
is one called disagree and commit.

824
00:35:55,404 --> 00:35:57,225
And these were teams that were really focused

825
00:35:57,265 --> 00:35:59,847
on building consensus, like that was very important for them.

826
00:36:00,307 --> 00:36:01,708
But on larger and larger teams,

827
00:36:01,788 --> 00:36:03,969
these teams acknowledged that that's not always possible,

828
00:36:04,009 --> 00:36:06,251
you don't always get everyone on the same page.

829
00:36:07,311 --> 00:36:08,812
And that's kind of fine, that's normal,

830
00:36:09,172 --> 00:36:11,194
but we saw teams that were much more successful

831
00:36:11,994 --> 00:36:14,256
focus in on if you can't build consensus,

832
00:36:14,416 --> 00:36:16,537
at least commit to the group, commit to the team.

833
00:36:17,137 --> 00:36:20,218
And by doing that, a lot of times they were able to eliminate a lot of the,

834
00:36:20,518 --> 00:36:25,200
well, I told you so, right, out there in the future, or people sabotaging the team

835
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:28,461
because they didn't feel like they ever bought into the decision.

836
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:31,662
So people that were willing to acknowledge and say their disagreement,

837
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:35,343
but then commit to each other as a team, were much more powerful teams.

838
00:36:38,918 --> 00:36:41,500
So the second cultural attribute we noticed a lot

839
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,301
was the teams had really good strategies

840
00:36:44,401 --> 00:36:45,762
for cutting through complexity.

841
00:36:46,923 --> 00:36:48,584
So just as an example here, this is

842
00:36:48,704 --> 00:36:50,746
a what we call a propaganda poster

843
00:36:50,786 --> 00:36:52,367
that these teams use in our studio.

844
00:36:52,387 --> 00:36:55,289
And this was for our recent VR title, I Expect You to Die.

845
00:36:56,449 --> 00:37:01,991
And lots of people use things like vision statements and pillars, but when we saw teams that were really good at cutting through

846
00:37:02,391 --> 00:37:03,592
complex decisions

847
00:37:04,512 --> 00:37:07,333
And understanding how to simplify down to what was really important

848
00:37:07,653 --> 00:37:11,835
These were teams that would essentially actively market their vision in their team

849
00:37:12,395 --> 00:37:15,537
They wouldn't just write it in a Google Doc or bury it on Perforce.

850
00:37:15,757 --> 00:37:16,658
They would make posters.

851
00:37:16,698 --> 00:37:18,359
They would hang them up in the team areas.

852
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,722
This became a marketing or propaganda effort for them to

853
00:37:21,742 --> 00:37:24,684
get everyone bought into that vision, which allowed a lot of

854
00:37:25,264 --> 00:37:28,807
really strong conversations of just, we have a lot of complex

855
00:37:29,167 --> 00:37:32,109
options in front of us, but how does that match up to our game

856
00:37:32,149 --> 00:37:32,370
pillar?

857
00:37:35,469 --> 00:37:38,912
Another really powerful phrase we noticed a lot was the term

858
00:37:39,332 --> 00:37:41,274
or the sentence, basically, what problem are

859
00:37:41,314 --> 00:37:42,174
we trying to solve?

860
00:37:43,115 --> 00:37:45,417
And Oksana mentioned earlier, starting with the why is

861
00:37:45,477 --> 00:37:46,278
really critical.

862
00:37:46,698 --> 00:37:48,740
And we found this is a really useful tool.

863
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:52,242
And teams leverage this a lot on really successful team

864
00:37:52,302 --> 00:37:55,405
cultures, because it kind of cuts through a lot of the

865
00:37:55,465 --> 00:37:58,827
complexity to focus on the actual core of the problem

866
00:37:58,847 --> 00:37:59,788
you're trying to address.

867
00:38:00,289 --> 00:38:02,790
And a lot of times that problem isn't obvious, may

868
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:03,831
have not been agreed to.

869
00:38:04,832 --> 00:38:06,353
or is really challenging to get to.

870
00:38:06,453 --> 00:38:08,495
But teams that were able to use this phrase

871
00:38:08,895 --> 00:38:11,177
were able to kind of get down to the meat of the conversation,

872
00:38:11,297 --> 00:38:12,878
get everyone on the same page with the problem

873
00:38:12,898 --> 00:38:13,719
we're trying to solve.

874
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:16,841
And it was much easier to move people through solution spaces.

875
00:38:20,004 --> 00:38:25,048
So our third one here are teams that were most successful

876
00:38:27,049 --> 00:38:28,390
were willing to be very vulnerable.

877
00:38:30,012 --> 00:38:33,675
And part of this involved them not punishing mistakes.

878
00:38:35,811 --> 00:38:41,317
And one side of this coin is being willing to admit your own mistakes or screw ups, but

879
00:38:41,357 --> 00:38:47,343
that set a lot of strong team culture as an example to the rest of the team that mistakes

880
00:38:47,383 --> 00:38:47,924
were okay.

881
00:38:47,964 --> 00:38:49,085
People were willing to hear them.

882
00:38:49,105 --> 00:38:50,947
They were willing to be vulnerable in front of each other.

883
00:38:50,967 --> 00:38:52,248
Because guess what?

884
00:38:52,268 --> 00:38:54,530
If you punish mistakes, it's not like they go away.

885
00:38:54,931 --> 00:38:57,413
You just don't hear about them anymore because people are afraid to tell you.

886
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:03,621
Another thing these teams did in their culture was a lot of

887
00:39:03,681 --> 00:39:05,643
transparency, which a few people have

888
00:39:05,683 --> 00:39:06,684
mentioned already today.

889
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:09,667
And I remember actually from my background in architecture, a

890
00:39:10,928 --> 00:39:13,551
lot of architects build houses with these giant-ass glass

891
00:39:13,611 --> 00:39:14,291
windows, right?

892
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:16,954
And people always think it's for the view or for the light

893
00:39:16,994 --> 00:39:17,494
in the house.

894
00:39:17,875 --> 00:39:20,337
But really, architects do that because you'll keep your house

895
00:39:20,417 --> 00:39:20,737
cleaner.

896
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:25,662
It changes the culture in your house to be transparent.

897
00:39:26,993 --> 00:39:30,835
If anybody's familiar with Frank Lloyd Wright, I remember one of his philosophies.

898
00:39:31,415 --> 00:39:36,557
He'd do a lot of houses for clients, and he would refuse to put garage doors on garages.

899
00:39:37,117 --> 00:39:40,719
He would only make carports, because he knew if he put garage doors on there,

900
00:39:40,759 --> 00:39:42,580
people would just fill their garages with crap.

901
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,161
And he didn't want people to do that. He wanted them to have simpler, cleaner lives.

902
00:39:46,662 --> 00:39:50,643
So he would build in transparency into their homes, even if they didn't want it.

903
00:39:53,298 --> 00:39:54,719
So it's kind of interesting to think about.

904
00:39:54,739 --> 00:39:58,000
I think a lot of folks view transparency on their team as

905
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,281
something they need to navigate or negotiate, either

906
00:40:00,301 --> 00:40:02,422
with their clients or partners or within their

907
00:40:02,462 --> 00:40:03,122
organization.

908
00:40:03,483 --> 00:40:05,764
But transparency on your team can actually be a real benefit

909
00:40:05,784 --> 00:40:08,185
or transformation for the culture on your own team.

910
00:40:11,446 --> 00:40:14,948
And last, number four, folks on these teams were excellent

911
00:40:14,968 --> 00:40:16,109
at resolving conflicts.

912
00:40:16,189 --> 00:40:19,550
But man, the thing that stuck out was how swift and rapid

913
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:20,531
they were able to do this.

914
00:40:22,487 --> 00:40:26,032
When we look at the best examples of this on teams, these are people who are resolving

915
00:40:26,072 --> 00:40:30,479
conflicts within minutes of them happening, not hours or days or weeks.

916
00:40:31,841 --> 00:40:36,068
So they had essentially zero hesitation in approaching each other to resolve conflicts.

917
00:40:38,489 --> 00:40:40,952
And I'll share another kind of key or powerful phrase.

918
00:40:41,012 --> 00:40:42,133
And this one's kind of funny.

919
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:46,418
This actually circulates around our studio and has been

920
00:40:46,438 --> 00:40:49,101
kind of a key phrase at Shell Games for a long time.

921
00:40:49,842 --> 00:40:52,825
And really, in my mind, it goes back to valuing the

922
00:40:52,886 --> 00:40:55,108
understanding of other people over just being right.

923
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:58,632
And that phrase is, tell me more about that.

924
00:40:59,766 --> 00:41:02,508
And we've kind of built a strong culture around people

925
00:41:02,708 --> 00:41:05,069
using that phrase when they disagree with someone or when

926
00:41:05,249 --> 00:41:06,590
someone says something that they

927
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:08,331
immediately recoil against.

928
00:41:09,131 --> 00:41:10,632
And it's kind of funny.

929
00:41:11,673 --> 00:41:14,194
About three weeks ago, we were sitting in a meeting and

930
00:41:14,214 --> 00:41:15,455
someone said this to someone else.

931
00:41:15,535 --> 00:41:19,357
And Jesse Schell, our CEO and founder, started laughing in

932
00:41:19,397 --> 00:41:20,217
the corner of the room.

933
00:41:20,698 --> 00:41:21,878
We're like, what's so funny?

934
00:41:21,918 --> 00:41:23,779
And he's like, I don't think you guys realize where I stole

935
00:41:23,819 --> 00:41:24,200
that from.

936
00:41:25,807 --> 00:41:28,968
He got that from a chatbot named Eliza that came out in 1966.

937
00:41:31,409 --> 00:41:34,650
And Eliza had such poor AI that she wouldn't really function

938
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:35,751
well when you chat with her.

939
00:41:36,691 --> 00:41:38,732
So to kind of trick people around this,

940
00:41:38,772 --> 00:41:41,193
they found a phrase where if Eliza didn't understand what

941
00:41:41,213 --> 00:41:43,274
you were saying, she would simply write back,

942
00:41:43,394 --> 00:41:44,295
tell me more about that.

943
00:41:46,404 --> 00:41:50,506
And it's kind of stupid, but it's an incredibly powerful phrase,

944
00:41:50,526 --> 00:41:52,888
because it really, it does two things, right?

945
00:41:52,908 --> 00:41:56,350
It signals to the other person that you really value understanding them.

946
00:41:57,011 --> 00:42:01,034
And to yourself, it reminds you that there's a lot more to understand

947
00:42:01,074 --> 00:42:03,295
to get to the why, to get to the real understanding

948
00:42:03,335 --> 00:42:04,916
of why someone is bringing something up.

949
00:42:05,296 --> 00:42:09,279
So it kind of lowers your initial, if your gut reaction isn't defense

950
00:42:09,319 --> 00:42:12,441
or countering someone's argument, but it's let me hear more

951
00:42:12,481 --> 00:42:13,842
about what you're trying to get across.

952
00:42:14,723 --> 00:42:16,724
Man, people don't change until they feel heard.

953
00:42:16,844 --> 00:42:18,784
And this is a good, kind of powerful phrase

954
00:42:18,824 --> 00:42:20,725
to remind you to hear other people.

955
00:42:25,606 --> 00:42:27,087
So everything we talked about today

956
00:42:27,627 --> 00:42:31,488
in terms of teams that thrive and teams that are successful

957
00:42:31,508 --> 00:42:33,049
and teams that have really high morale,

958
00:42:34,649 --> 00:42:36,530
all of this from our observations

959
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:38,691
boiled down to essentially how people treated each other

960
00:42:38,751 --> 00:42:39,191
on the team.

961
00:42:39,611 --> 00:42:43,272
You know, success was never based on a strategy or a process.

962
00:42:44,211 --> 00:42:45,951
It always ended up being part of the culture,

963
00:42:46,211 --> 00:42:48,052
and that culture needed to be built bit by bit

964
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:50,212
by every single person on the team.

965
00:42:51,753 --> 00:42:52,913
And if you haven't noticed already,

966
00:42:52,953 --> 00:42:54,633
those four items we just talked about,

967
00:42:54,693 --> 00:42:56,594
those aren't things that your team can do.

968
00:42:56,954 --> 00:42:58,274
Those are things that you can do.

969
00:42:59,255 --> 00:43:01,215
Because culture made strategy for breakfast,

970
00:43:01,855 --> 00:43:03,136
but you get to make the culture.

971
00:43:04,216 --> 00:43:05,456
So while you're here at GDC,

972
00:43:05,576 --> 00:43:06,816
I would certainly challenge everybody

973
00:43:06,836 --> 00:43:08,537
not to get too swept up in focusing

974
00:43:08,577 --> 00:43:09,777
on how to improve your teams.

975
00:43:10,985 --> 00:43:12,208
Focus on improving yourself.

976
00:43:12,649 --> 00:43:15,094
Be the best example of what you want your team to be.

977
00:43:15,174 --> 00:43:16,396
Be an exemplar for them.

978
00:43:17,138 --> 00:43:19,142
That's where your best value is going to be, and that's

979
00:43:19,162 --> 00:43:20,264
going to give you the best chance of

980
00:43:20,324 --> 00:43:21,226
making a thriving team.

981
00:43:22,228 --> 00:43:22,469
Thanks.

982
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:32,671
Alright, alright, stand up. We're gonna do something a little different this time.

983
00:43:32,711 --> 00:43:35,031
So last year... stand up still, you still have to stand up.

984
00:43:35,331 --> 00:43:38,732
So last year's version of this talk, the prequel if you will,

985
00:43:38,792 --> 00:43:42,393
Michelle Ducker talked about stress and dealing with stress

986
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:45,234
and one of her ways of dealing with it is to scream.

987
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:48,275
And I like to do this because it really messes with the people on both sides of us.

988
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:52,376
So what I want you to do is I want you to take just a few seconds, close your eyes,

989
00:43:52,436 --> 00:43:57,957
and think about what makes you stressed this week, what makes you stressed at work, the

990
00:43:57,977 --> 00:44:00,938
things that you're kind of thinking about now instead of just being present and being

991
00:44:00,978 --> 00:44:04,319
part of this, and then on the count of three we're all going to scream as loud as we can

992
00:44:04,339 --> 00:44:04,839
and get that out.

993
00:44:04,879 --> 00:44:05,179
Okay?

994
00:44:05,299 --> 00:44:05,519
Ready?

995
00:44:06,379 --> 00:44:06,579
Okay.

996
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:09,300
One, two, three.

997
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:12,000
Ahhh!

998
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:13,100
Perfect.

999
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:13,380
Okay.

1000
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:18,021
Now, do the normal thing, turn and talk to each other for a few seconds and we'll get

1001
00:44:18,061 --> 00:44:18,542
that going.

1002
00:44:20,487 --> 00:44:22,529
I think I'm stressed about this.

1003
00:44:22,689 --> 00:44:22,910
This.

1004
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:23,270
That's fun.

1005
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:23,730
You have 15 minutes.

1006
00:44:23,771 --> 00:44:25,252
You're the only one outside.

1007
00:44:25,492 --> 00:44:26,353
Don't take 15 minutes.

1008
00:44:26,513 --> 00:44:27,074
I don't actually.

1009
00:44:33,619 --> 00:44:34,520
Don't take 15 minutes, but you have 15 minutes.

1010
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,420
Someone produced this.

1011
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:02,501
Well done, Grant.

1012
00:45:02,601 --> 00:45:05,882
And created a story, a narrative.

1013
00:45:05,902 --> 00:45:07,082
You're right, it's almost like that.

1014
00:45:07,282 --> 00:45:11,864
Yeah, it's not quite enough.

1015
00:45:22,168 --> 00:45:23,408
Alright, alright.

1016
00:45:25,829 --> 00:45:27,970
One more to go, and then you can

1017
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:29,370
talk in the hallways forever.

1018
00:45:30,396 --> 00:45:33,819
You can spend as much time getting to know each other as you want.

1019
00:45:35,261 --> 00:45:35,781
All right.

1020
00:45:36,542 --> 00:45:36,922
All right.

1021
00:45:37,263 --> 00:45:38,584
I just want to like McConaughey.

1022
00:45:38,724 --> 00:45:39,125
All right.

1023
00:45:39,145 --> 00:45:39,465
All right.

1024
00:45:39,505 --> 00:45:39,885
All right.

1025
00:45:42,248 --> 00:45:42,908
People in the back.

1026
00:45:43,769 --> 00:45:45,051
Everybody in front of you is sat down.

1027
00:45:45,091 --> 00:45:47,753
That is the indicator that we are ready to move on with our lives.

1028
00:45:49,732 --> 00:45:51,793
Alright, last one, here we go.

1029
00:45:52,974 --> 00:45:56,176
Brian over here is game director at Backflip Studios.

1030
00:45:56,536 --> 00:45:58,037
They're based in Boulder, Colorado.

1031
00:45:58,838 --> 00:46:02,000
He constantly is going to Red Rock and sending me pictures and making me angry.

1032
00:46:02,861 --> 00:46:06,423
He's worked on a bunch of games, Paper Toss, which is one of my favorite, Ninjump, Ragdoll

1033
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:11,087
Blaster franchise, along with Dragon Bale, and his personal favorite, Army of Darkness

1034
00:46:11,127 --> 00:46:11,567
Defense.

1035
00:46:12,067 --> 00:46:12,488
Alright, Brian.

1036
00:46:19,701 --> 00:46:21,662
What I just screamed about was this moment.

1037
00:46:23,603 --> 00:46:24,764
What are you most stressed about?

1038
00:46:25,024 --> 00:46:26,304
About 12 seconds from now.

1039
00:46:29,166 --> 00:46:30,707
So forgive me for being a little raspy.

1040
00:46:31,587 --> 00:46:36,369
In my lifetime, I've been an algebra teacher, a wrestling coach, I was a bartender, I was

1041
00:46:36,409 --> 00:46:36,990
a pastor.

1042
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:38,030
That didn't stick.

1043
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:43,293
I was the lead singer in an 80s cover band, which is what that picture is.

1044
00:46:43,373 --> 00:46:45,514
I'm not crying or hungry, I'm singing.

1045
00:46:48,452 --> 00:46:53,457
And this kind of crooked path through a bunch of different jobs and careers and weird things

1046
00:46:54,498 --> 00:46:58,002
Has helped me realize that no matter the job no matter the scenario

1047
00:46:58,743 --> 00:47:04,670
Whether it's a sophomore who's retaking algebra because he failed it once already and hates you on day one

1048
00:47:05,951 --> 00:47:11,413
Or maybe it's a really fiery debate about the nature of magic and dragons with your lead artist.

1049
00:47:11,894 --> 00:47:19,537
Being able to communicate in the midst of conflict is a skill that will help you everywhere, always.

1050
00:47:20,397 --> 00:47:20,577
Right?

1051
00:47:21,498 --> 00:47:27,480
So, it is a little difficult talking about soft skills, feely things,

1052
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:32,522
and having it not feel like a poster hung in your kitchen in your game studio, like,

1053
00:47:32,542 --> 00:47:33,242
hang in there.

1054
00:47:33,843 --> 00:47:33,943
Um...

1055
00:47:35,191 --> 00:47:37,374
Because it can feel like platitudes, right?

1056
00:47:37,755 --> 00:47:43,042
What is a concrete thing that we can do from soft skills?

1057
00:47:43,082 --> 00:47:46,027
And that's why they're called soft skills, not so concrete.

1058
00:47:47,349 --> 00:47:49,752
So, but my aim today is to target a few scenarios

1059
00:47:49,772 --> 00:47:51,314
that you will inevitably find yourself in.

1060
00:47:52,175 --> 00:47:55,036
at different points in your career, provide you some resources.

1061
00:47:55,797 --> 00:47:57,357
Oxana and I picked one of the same books.

1062
00:47:58,397 --> 00:47:59,958
She shares some examples from my life,

1063
00:48:00,578 --> 00:48:03,459
so that hopefully my failures can enlighten you,

1064
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:06,420
or at least you can laugh at me, which is fine.

1065
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:10,342
But my intent is not to give you a bunch of crap for motivational posters,

1066
00:48:10,902 --> 00:48:12,102
although that might end up happening.

1067
00:48:13,623 --> 00:48:16,944
So, I wanted to do... Here's some books. These are good.

1068
00:48:17,712 --> 00:48:20,592
You should read them, except for the third one, because it's not out yet.

1069
00:48:22,053 --> 00:48:27,034
It comes out in like two weeks, but Kim Scott gives a bunch of talks about radical candor.

1070
00:48:27,514 --> 00:48:32,155
And so, the whole point of this is, this is difficult conversations having to initiate them.

1071
00:48:32,235 --> 00:48:33,895
It's receiving feedback.

1072
00:48:34,215 --> 00:48:40,577
The five love languages is a bit churchy, as a heads up, but understanding what motivates people,

1073
00:48:40,637 --> 00:48:42,397
getting to the why, is an important thing.

1074
00:48:42,997 --> 00:48:47,158
And this does a really good job of understanding what motivates different types of people.

1075
00:48:48,219 --> 00:48:49,560
And then the five dysfunctions of a team,

1076
00:48:49,661 --> 00:48:51,182
Oxana's right, go read it now.

1077
00:48:52,243 --> 00:48:54,265
Maybe not right now.

1078
00:48:55,146 --> 00:48:57,589
So I think it's important, you were talking about,

1079
00:48:57,869 --> 00:48:58,750
who was talking about this?

1080
00:48:59,411 --> 00:48:59,651
Chuck.

1081
00:49:00,512 --> 00:49:03,255
Was talking about conflict and how it got resolved quickly.

1082
00:49:03,816 --> 00:49:05,037
Conflict isn't failure.

1083
00:49:06,452 --> 00:49:08,274
And this is important to know.

1084
00:49:08,374 --> 00:49:09,635
Conflict is not failure.

1085
00:49:10,096 --> 00:49:16,122
If I worked at a place with only clones of myself, first of all, that is damn terrifying.

1086
00:49:18,004 --> 00:49:19,545
The beer fridge would be well-stocked, though.

1087
00:49:21,167 --> 00:49:22,428
But I would still have problems.

1088
00:49:23,950 --> 00:49:27,434
I get mad at myself, arguably more than Goody does.

1089
00:49:29,268 --> 00:49:29,688
Arguably.

1090
00:49:30,469 --> 00:49:35,532
Um, conflict is the surest human interaction with a group of people over time.

1091
00:49:35,652 --> 00:49:39,474
My own equation is people plus time equals hostility.

1092
00:49:42,976 --> 00:49:44,557
It's inescapable.

1093
00:49:45,618 --> 00:49:49,340
Um, and so, uh, and this is also just like a really good lesson to learn.

1094
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,962
I think a lot of producers, a lot of leaders like to be liked.

1095
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:57,501
And it's super important that you just absorb this now.

1096
00:49:58,202 --> 00:49:59,322
Some people won't like you.

1097
00:50:01,643 --> 00:50:02,624
And that's okay.

1098
00:50:04,044 --> 00:50:04,904
We're not for everybody.

1099
00:50:05,345 --> 00:50:06,345
Everybody's not for us.

1100
00:50:06,905 --> 00:50:07,906
Some people won't like you.

1101
00:50:08,346 --> 00:50:08,866
That's all right.

1102
00:50:10,087 --> 00:50:13,588
I mean, that's not like a badge to go around

1103
00:50:13,628 --> 00:50:15,629
and be like Captain A-hole firing off all the time.

1104
00:50:17,009 --> 00:50:18,030
Some people just don't like me.

1105
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:19,350
That's not, right?

1106
00:50:20,718 --> 00:50:25,260
It's not an excuse to run roughshod and be a douche, but I am saying it is okay.

1107
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,201
Some people won't like you.

1108
00:50:29,202 --> 00:50:34,665
So here are the three types of conflict you will undoubtedly have in your life, work,

1109
00:50:35,185 --> 00:50:36,345
things, always.

1110
00:50:37,726 --> 00:50:41,268
When members of your team are not getting along and you have to mediate that.

1111
00:50:41,988 --> 00:50:43,609
Sometimes people don't like each other.

1112
00:50:45,081 --> 00:50:47,081
Chuck and Grant, tough to tell sometimes.

1113
00:50:48,742 --> 00:50:50,102
Sometimes people don't like each other.

1114
00:50:50,122 --> 00:50:51,982
Or sometimes there is conflict

1115
00:50:52,082 --> 00:50:53,663
and they're not great at navigating that.

1116
00:50:54,863 --> 00:50:56,263
Sometimes you have to be the person

1117
00:50:56,283 --> 00:50:58,063
who initiates a difficult conversation.

1118
00:50:58,083 --> 00:50:59,564
You have to say something to someone

1119
00:51:00,024 --> 00:51:02,524
that you are relatively certain is going to be unpopular.

1120
00:51:04,125 --> 00:51:07,045
And then at some point in your life,

1121
00:51:07,445 --> 00:51:10,466
you are going to have to be told something you don't love.

1122
00:51:11,946 --> 00:51:14,067
And knowing how to be able to do that is important.

1123
00:51:15,321 --> 00:51:19,523
So, how to handle when folks aren't getting along.

1124
00:51:21,604 --> 00:51:25,125
So, step one, have them try to do it themselves.

1125
00:51:26,006 --> 00:51:27,086
I know that sounds lazy,

1126
00:51:27,566 --> 00:51:29,527
and it sounds a lot like conflict avoidance,

1127
00:51:29,927 --> 00:51:31,468
and the opposite of what I'm talking about

1128
00:51:31,508 --> 00:51:32,428
for the next five minutes,

1129
00:51:32,949 --> 00:51:35,630
but if you can trust them to figure it out themselves,

1130
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:36,950
trust them to be adults,

1131
00:51:37,631 --> 00:51:38,731
I think you guys can figure this out.

1132
00:51:38,811 --> 00:51:40,832
You girls, you can figure it out, figure it out, right?

1133
00:51:42,095 --> 00:51:45,339
But you have to monitor the situation, otherwise that actually is just laziness.

1134
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:50,644
Because what happens in a lot of conflicts is one person feels fine.

1135
00:51:51,905 --> 00:51:53,727
I have been heard, I feel fine.

1136
00:51:54,147 --> 00:51:55,749
And the other person, not fine.

1137
00:51:56,910 --> 00:51:58,612
And if you ask somebody, hey how are you doing?

1138
00:51:58,952 --> 00:51:59,273
Fine.

1139
00:51:59,553 --> 00:52:00,354
How are you doing?

1140
00:52:00,754 --> 00:52:01,094
Not fine.

1141
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:04,338
You gotta be able to manage and understand that.

1142
00:52:05,322 --> 00:52:06,943
So what I try to do is bring people together,

1143
00:52:06,963 --> 00:52:10,426
I put them in the same room and purposely mediate.

1144
00:52:10,506 --> 00:52:13,208
My wife's a therapist, so I get lots of practice.

1145
00:52:13,689 --> 00:52:15,250
She specializes in adolescence,

1146
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:17,052
which is how she puts up with me.

1147
00:52:19,534 --> 00:52:21,655
She married a giant man-child.

1148
00:52:23,137 --> 00:52:25,559
But what I find when you put people in the same room

1149
00:52:25,719 --> 00:52:27,901
is their complaints get a little less hyperbolic.

1150
00:52:28,967 --> 00:52:30,948
It's not, they never listen to me.

1151
00:52:31,068 --> 00:52:32,409
It's always this way.

1152
00:52:32,469 --> 00:52:34,050
They treat me like I'm stupid.

1153
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:35,871
It's, I kind of don't feel listened to.

1154
00:52:36,852 --> 00:52:38,673
There's a difference in how people communicate

1155
00:52:38,813 --> 00:52:41,035
when they face their accuser.

1156
00:52:42,276 --> 00:52:44,037
But having people in the same room is helpful.

1157
00:52:45,438 --> 00:52:46,899
And it's also important to know that there's a difference

1158
00:52:46,959 --> 00:52:48,460
between somebody who needs to vent

1159
00:52:49,201 --> 00:52:50,342
and when it's time to mediate.

1160
00:52:51,202 --> 00:52:53,163
Sometimes somebody's just gotta be able to come in,

1161
00:52:53,204 --> 00:52:55,645
close the door and go, what the fuck?

1162
00:52:57,428 --> 00:52:59,529
That's an important thing that needs to happen sometimes.

1163
00:53:00,309 --> 00:53:03,090
And then, I think we just got the adult rating, sorry.

1164
00:53:03,830 --> 00:53:07,511
And then there's a time where you're like,

1165
00:53:07,651 --> 00:53:09,311
okay, that wasn't just a vent.

1166
00:53:09,691 --> 00:53:11,552
This is a persistent issue that we're gonna have to handle.

1167
00:53:12,972 --> 00:53:15,313
So here's a few things that I like to do in these moments.

1168
00:53:15,853 --> 00:53:18,914
I like to remember that conflict arises

1169
00:53:19,094 --> 00:53:20,594
out of passion, not apathy.

1170
00:53:22,129 --> 00:53:25,310
Usually conflict happens because people believe in something and they believe

1171
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:29,611
different things and their ideas are problems, right? Um,

1172
00:53:30,051 --> 00:53:34,013
I loved, tell me more about that. Tell me, tell me some more about that.

1173
00:53:34,773 --> 00:53:37,774
What I'm hearing is what does that feel like?

1174
00:53:38,514 --> 00:53:42,275
What does resolution look like to you? What does this, here we are,

1175
00:53:42,415 --> 00:53:44,876
we have a conflict. What does the solution look like to you?

1176
00:53:46,076 --> 00:53:47,756
Asking, do you feel like you're being understood?

1177
00:53:49,201 --> 00:53:50,361
Giving somebody the opportunity to go,

1178
00:53:50,762 --> 00:53:52,582
no, I'm pretty sure you're just talking.

1179
00:53:53,503 --> 00:53:55,224
I do that sometimes.

1180
00:53:55,684 --> 00:53:56,604
And then one of my favorite,

1181
00:53:56,784 --> 00:53:59,085
it was actually Clint who sent me a list

1182
00:53:59,125 --> 00:54:00,386
of 31 powerful questions,

1183
00:54:00,426 --> 00:54:01,606
and one of my favorite ones was,

1184
00:54:02,147 --> 00:54:05,208
if you could go back and do this over again,

1185
00:54:05,588 --> 00:54:06,569
what would you do differently?

1186
00:54:07,749 --> 00:54:09,690
It's a really good way to get somebody

1187
00:54:09,710 --> 00:54:12,111
to analyze a conflict situation and go,

1188
00:54:13,825 --> 00:54:15,566
Yeah, what would I do differently?

1189
00:54:15,987 --> 00:54:17,948
And it puts it on them, what could they have done

1190
00:54:17,988 --> 00:54:18,969
to improve this scenario?

1191
00:54:19,009 --> 00:54:22,532
So that's step one.

1192
00:54:24,474 --> 00:54:27,036
So you have to tell somebody something

1193
00:54:27,076 --> 00:54:28,557
that you think is going to embarrass them

1194
00:54:30,059 --> 00:54:31,800
or make them feel bad about themselves.

1195
00:54:34,282 --> 00:54:36,284
How do you do that in a reasonable way?

1196
00:54:37,245 --> 00:54:39,186
Maybe that's you have to give like the hygiene talk.

1197
00:54:39,627 --> 00:54:41,488
Has anybody ever had to give the hygiene talk?

1198
00:54:44,245 --> 00:54:54,189
And not to like too broad a strokes, but it usually starts with, dude.

1199
00:54:54,909 --> 00:54:55,509
Not always.

1200
00:54:55,529 --> 00:55:00,851
Maybe you've got to tell someone on your team that their work isn't meeting the standards

1201
00:55:00,891 --> 00:55:01,651
that you've set.

1202
00:55:02,587 --> 00:55:04,569
You're not hitting the bar that we've decided on.

1203
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:07,891
There's kind of two scenarios here.

1204
00:55:08,531 --> 00:55:10,333
Sometimes it's simply helping someone

1205
00:55:10,373 --> 00:55:11,754
see something they're oblivious to,

1206
00:55:11,794 --> 00:55:12,754
like lettuce in their teeth.

1207
00:55:13,215 --> 00:55:14,455
And sometimes it's,

1208
00:55:15,656 --> 00:55:17,558
they'll make an observation about themselves

1209
00:55:17,578 --> 00:55:19,639
because they've got a sneaking suspicion they're not great.

1210
00:55:20,139 --> 00:55:20,800
And they will say,

1211
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:22,561
oh, I just don't think I'm doing a good job.

1212
00:55:23,001 --> 00:55:24,983
And a lot of folks are gonna try and say,

1213
00:55:25,003 --> 00:55:27,364
no, no, you're fine, you're fine.

1214
00:55:28,145 --> 00:55:28,365
Nope.

1215
00:55:30,276 --> 00:55:34,238
You have a responsibility, you have a moral obligation

1216
00:55:34,398 --> 00:55:36,479
as a leader to be able to say,

1217
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:38,599
man, I think you might be right.

1218
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:41,080
Things don't feel awesome right now.

1219
00:55:41,381 --> 00:55:42,161
What can I do to help you?

1220
00:55:43,502 --> 00:55:45,582
You're right, it feels like things are a little off.

1221
00:55:45,622 --> 00:55:46,303
What can I do to help?

1222
00:55:46,323 --> 00:55:47,683
I think that's super important.

1223
00:55:49,144 --> 00:55:52,025
All right, getting to that time.

1224
00:55:53,526 --> 00:55:56,127
When you have to receive a message that you don't love.

1225
00:55:57,227 --> 00:55:58,188
Don't just cover your ears.

1226
00:56:01,503 --> 00:56:04,105
So for me, I'm going to tell a bit of a personal story.

1227
00:56:04,205 --> 00:56:06,907
I know we're getting close to the end of the time and this is helpful because then I won't

1228
00:56:06,947 --> 00:56:07,688
get emotional about it.

1229
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:14,253
I had a tough conversation that stung and I had a tough time hearing it.

1230
00:56:14,813 --> 00:56:15,294
I will say...

1231
00:56:16,884 --> 00:56:19,685
It led me to meditation practice actually,

1232
00:56:20,066 --> 00:56:22,527
and thank you to Brian Sharp who gave a talk about that

1233
00:56:22,567 --> 00:56:23,648
and really kind of changed my life.

1234
00:56:25,129 --> 00:56:26,030
But a couple things here.

1235
00:56:26,930 --> 00:56:28,952
When somebody, these are just kind of very practical things.

1236
00:56:29,012 --> 00:56:29,932
If somebody tells you something

1237
00:56:29,952 --> 00:56:31,033
that you don't think you're gonna love,

1238
00:56:32,915 --> 00:56:35,256
understand the truth, understand their truth,

1239
00:56:35,336 --> 00:56:37,338
hear what they're hearing, not just what you think.

1240
00:56:37,918 --> 00:56:39,279
Find the nuggets of truth in that,

1241
00:56:39,319 --> 00:56:40,880
even if you don't agree with the entire message.

1242
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:43,061
Remove the buts, right?

1243
00:56:43,081 --> 00:56:44,763
You're gonna be like, well yeah, but that,

1244
00:56:45,143 --> 00:56:45,723
it's not about them.

1245
00:56:46,838 --> 00:56:47,218
It's about you.

1246
00:56:48,419 --> 00:56:48,799
Take that.

1247
00:56:52,262 --> 00:56:54,824
So, how to do this quickly.

1248
00:56:56,165 --> 00:56:58,046
Imagine, let me paint a picture for you

1249
00:56:58,727 --> 00:57:00,268
that could be viewed two different ways.

1250
00:57:01,629 --> 00:57:03,290
You're in a meeting, you're a person who's

1251
00:57:03,330 --> 00:57:05,452
slightly intimidated by the person leading the meeting.

1252
00:57:05,952 --> 00:57:08,894
You're a bit quiet, you're worried your feedback's

1253
00:57:08,914 --> 00:57:10,175
gonna get shot down or dismissed.

1254
00:57:11,357 --> 00:57:13,098
The leader senses that and asks you to speak.

1255
00:57:13,478 --> 00:57:15,599
You fidget uncomfortably, you stammer,

1256
00:57:16,239 --> 00:57:18,160
you don't do a good job presenting your idea.

1257
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,441
The leader presses you again saying,

1258
00:57:20,821 --> 00:57:22,522
it's your job, speak up.

1259
00:57:24,342 --> 00:57:27,083
In that moment, you feel vulnerable and a little humiliated.

1260
00:57:27,744 --> 00:57:29,684
Your leader seems like a bully who cornered you

1261
00:57:29,745 --> 00:57:30,725
and kind of made you feel dumb.

1262
00:57:33,726 --> 00:57:36,047
Or, you're the team lead.

1263
00:57:36,973 --> 00:57:38,595
You're having a discussion about an upcoming release

1264
00:57:38,635 --> 00:57:41,317
for your game, it's a relatively healthy group discussion,

1265
00:57:41,357 --> 00:57:42,858
but your designer hasn't chimed in.

1266
00:57:43,678 --> 00:57:44,719
You ask them for their thoughts,

1267
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,500
they kind of muddle through it,

1268
00:57:47,461 --> 00:57:48,802
you push them to clarify,

1269
00:57:49,323 --> 00:57:50,864
they say they'd prefer not to comment,

1270
00:57:51,304 --> 00:57:53,846
and you remind them that it is literally

1271
00:57:53,906 --> 00:57:56,848
their job description to have opinions about this feature.

1272
00:58:00,731 --> 00:58:01,632
Guess which one I was?

1273
00:58:03,593 --> 00:58:05,034
In this scenario, without knowing it,

1274
00:58:05,414 --> 00:58:06,375
I was a total bully.

1275
00:58:07,905 --> 00:58:08,666
I didn't know it.

1276
00:58:09,286 --> 00:58:10,067
I didn't mean to be.

1277
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:13,809
Like I didn't, I think of myself as a rather gregarious dude.

1278
00:58:13,869 --> 00:58:15,130
I kind of try to be a little,

1279
00:58:15,410 --> 00:58:17,132
my wife calls me intensely laid back.

1280
00:58:21,815 --> 00:58:23,576
I thought I was the pretty girl in this picture.

1281
00:58:23,596 --> 00:58:24,677
I was not.

1282
00:58:25,457 --> 00:58:27,439
I goaded someone who was being quiet.

1283
00:58:27,539 --> 00:58:29,320
I prodded them when they felt intimidated.

1284
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:32,962
I didn't allow their truth of intimidation to exist

1285
00:58:33,243 --> 00:58:34,003
because I didn't mean it.

1286
00:58:34,855 --> 00:58:37,176
It's like when I was little and my brother would hit me,

1287
00:58:37,976 --> 00:58:39,857
and it hurt, and he's like, I barely hit you.

1288
00:58:40,538 --> 00:58:41,238
We were both right.

1289
00:58:41,999 --> 00:58:43,920
He did barely hit me compared to what he could do,

1290
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:46,301
but damn, he's four and a half years older than me,

1291
00:58:46,321 --> 00:58:48,382
he's like six foot two in the military, he's mean.

1292
00:58:49,103 --> 00:58:51,124
He hurt.

1293
00:58:53,165 --> 00:58:55,106
But it wasn't my intention, but my behavior that mattered.

1294
00:58:55,786 --> 00:58:57,687
And in their moment of vulnerability,

1295
00:58:58,268 --> 00:59:00,769
I met that with aggression and snark.

1296
00:59:05,259 --> 00:59:09,922
So I got pulled in by the founder of my company

1297
00:59:09,942 --> 00:59:12,383
and the HR manager that I was being threatening.

1298
00:59:14,925 --> 00:59:15,725
Phwoar.

1299
00:59:17,366 --> 00:59:19,468
Dude, that hurt.

1300
00:59:20,108 --> 00:59:21,769
And I wanted to make excuses,

1301
00:59:22,049 --> 00:59:23,530
and I had all the buts,

1302
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:26,132
but it's his job, but it, but, but, but, no.

1303
00:59:28,793 --> 00:59:30,654
Somebody felt threatened by me.

1304
00:59:32,315 --> 00:59:32,776
I had to.

1305
00:59:34,157 --> 00:59:37,579
I had to feel the truth of that and think,

1306
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:39,861
I'm a fucking bully.

1307
00:59:42,623 --> 00:59:43,444
And that hurt.

1308
00:59:45,165 --> 00:59:46,506
But I had to see that truth of it,

1309
00:59:46,546 --> 00:59:48,628
and I had to understand, and I had to process that

1310
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:52,071
because it was important to how I treat people

1311
00:59:52,551 --> 00:59:54,112
and how I lead now.

1312
00:59:54,953 --> 00:59:56,574
This was an important thing for me to hear,

1313
00:59:56,614 --> 00:59:58,816
and I didn't love hearing it.

1314
01:00:00,626 --> 01:00:05,768
I'm going to leave you with some little snippet to remind myself to not be emotional about this anymore,

1315
01:00:06,608 --> 01:00:12,691
which is when you get into a position of leadership, the same discussion that you have,

1316
01:00:14,132 --> 01:00:17,733
the same words with the same person changes context and you have to be aware of that.

1317
01:00:18,854 --> 01:00:21,775
I wasn't aware of that and it's why I was being a bully essentially.

1318
01:00:22,275 --> 01:00:24,656
I would be able to have a discussion with somebody and go, that's kind of dumb.

1319
01:00:27,502 --> 01:00:28,202
Why would we do that?

1320
01:00:29,063 --> 01:00:30,304
Sometimes that would almost be like

1321
01:00:30,324 --> 01:00:32,285
a healthy conversation starter with your peers,

1322
01:00:33,326 --> 01:00:34,487
not so much when you're in charge.

1323
01:00:35,948 --> 01:00:37,970
Hey, that's dumb, sounds really dismissive.

1324
01:00:39,311 --> 01:00:40,732
Don't, I mean, don't do that anyway, but still.

1325
01:00:42,433 --> 01:00:42,633
So,

1326
01:00:46,556 --> 01:00:47,777
if you have the final say,

1327
01:00:49,138 --> 01:00:49,919
don't speak first.

1328
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:51,320
Thank you.

1329
01:00:58,943 --> 01:01:02,446
Alright, so we're actually pretty much out of time.

1330
01:01:03,266 --> 01:01:05,368
I want to thank you all for coming and joining us

1331
01:01:05,428 --> 01:01:06,489
on the journey of production,

1332
01:01:06,509 --> 01:01:08,150
working on the Heart of the Team Part Two.

1333
01:01:08,490 --> 01:01:09,391
Maybe there'll be a Part Three,

1334
01:01:09,411 --> 01:01:10,952
because you're all going to give us excellent reviews.

1335
01:01:11,873 --> 01:01:12,794
So thank you for coming.

1336
01:01:12,914 --> 01:01:14,715
Also, thank you to the awesome CAs in the back,

1337
01:01:14,775 --> 01:01:18,078
George, Autumn, Chris, William, for working our shit.

1338
01:01:18,558 --> 01:01:22,121
And Eric and the rest of the AV crew for providing AV.

1339
01:01:22,221 --> 01:01:24,003
If you have any questions, we will be around.

1340
01:01:24,023 --> 01:01:24,943
Thank you very much for coming.
