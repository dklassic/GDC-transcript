1
00:00:05,734 --> 00:00:07,055
very last slide of my presentation,

2
00:00:07,115 --> 00:00:09,296
I have some contact information on there for you,

3
00:00:09,317 --> 00:00:11,798
so my email address and my Twitter account.

4
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:14,000
So feel free to reach out to me after the talk

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,342
if you wish to follow up on any of the subjects

6
00:00:17,362 --> 00:00:18,002
that I covered today.

7
00:00:19,463 --> 00:00:22,725
How many of you are familiar with the Londar?

8
00:00:23,766 --> 00:00:24,627
Oh gosh, okay.

9
00:00:27,408 --> 00:00:31,171
I guess I better be careful what I say then.

10
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,053
Okay, how many of you have actually played it though?

11
00:00:35,181 --> 00:00:36,104
Okay, all right, good.

12
00:00:36,846 --> 00:00:38,570
My favorite new thing is when you ask people,

13
00:00:39,011 --> 00:00:40,696
like in job interviews, if they've played your game,

14
00:00:40,716 --> 00:00:43,062
and they all say no, but I've watched a lot of streams

15
00:00:43,122 --> 00:00:43,644
of it, which is.

16
00:00:44,746 --> 00:00:45,847
Not exactly the same thing.

17
00:00:46,388 --> 00:00:49,230
So, I'm just gonna, for the sake of kind of

18
00:00:49,631 --> 00:00:51,452
setting the stage for this presentation,

19
00:00:51,693 --> 00:00:52,854
I spent a lot of time talking about,

20
00:00:53,174 --> 00:00:55,396
like making comparisons between sandbox mode in our game

21
00:00:55,436 --> 00:00:56,177
and story mode in the game.

22
00:00:56,837 --> 00:00:58,279
So I thought a good way to kind of refresh that

23
00:00:58,319 --> 00:00:59,380
would be I'll play, I'm gonna play

24
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:00,961
our launch trailers for both,

25
00:01:02,122 --> 00:01:04,665
just to kind of highlight maybe the differences

26
00:01:04,705 --> 00:01:06,486
in how we present the two modes.

27
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:08,709
And then I'll segue into the presentation.

28
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:09,930
The reason I'm doing that is because

29
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:14,474
I made the critical mistake of a game developer, which is I'm using new software in a live

30
00:01:15,174 --> 00:01:15,695
operation.

31
00:01:16,956 --> 00:01:21,219
So I'm not good enough with Keynote to do a proper swap between video and...

32
00:01:26,303 --> 00:01:26,943
and my keynote.

33
00:01:27,023 --> 00:01:30,404
So I'm gonna start by playing the Sandbox trailer

34
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:30,805
that we launched.

35
00:01:30,825 --> 00:01:32,305
It's almost two years old now,

36
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:34,406
so since you're all really familiar with the game,

37
00:01:34,426 --> 00:01:35,366
you'll probably see some things

38
00:01:35,406 --> 00:01:36,447
that you know are outdated by now,

39
00:01:36,467 --> 00:01:39,928
but this is, I think, a good way to establish

40
00:01:40,288 --> 00:01:42,729
how we think about, how we talk about,

41
00:01:42,749 --> 00:01:44,610
and how we present the Sandbox mode.

42
00:01:46,471 --> 00:01:46,811
Excuse me.

43
00:01:52,473 --> 00:01:54,253
Oh, shoot.

44
00:01:54,394 --> 00:01:55,634
This is what I was talking about, sorry.

45
00:01:57,473 --> 00:01:58,754
One second, one second.

46
00:01:58,794 --> 00:01:59,875
I'm very sorry.

47
00:02:03,537 --> 00:02:04,618
Maybe I won't do that.

48
00:02:06,339 --> 00:02:07,860
All right, let's try that again, shall we?

49
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,422
Thank you.

52
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:40,959
Alright, so that's Sandbox.

53
00:03:54,521 --> 00:04:00,286
And you know, sort of the emphasis on the atmosphere,

54
00:04:00,386 --> 00:04:04,570
the ambient experience, that's really the focus

55
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,831
of the sandbox experience for us.

56
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:09,014
And then by comparison, I'm gonna play for you

57
00:04:09,094 --> 00:04:12,197
the trailer that we launched on August 1st

58
00:04:12,237 --> 00:04:13,398
when we launched the first two episodes

59
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:15,119
of our story mode last year.

60
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:21,525
I didn't come here to fight about the past.

61
00:04:22,515 --> 00:04:24,757
I need a pilot to take me somewhere remote.

62
00:04:25,577 --> 00:04:27,479
Someone who won't ask too many questions.

63
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,881
Someone I can trust.

64
00:04:29,901 --> 00:04:31,923
Wait, questions?

65
00:04:33,164 --> 00:04:34,625
Astrid, are you in trouble?

66
00:04:36,106 --> 00:04:37,708
Are you gonna help me or not?

67
00:04:37,728 --> 00:04:45,114
The power went out.

68
00:04:46,155 --> 00:04:46,975
Who knows the reason?

69
00:04:48,116 --> 00:04:49,838
People started to get cold.

70
00:04:53,535 --> 00:04:55,377
started to talk crazy.

71
00:04:57,559 --> 00:04:59,361
Others walked here from the highway.

72
00:05:00,442 --> 00:05:01,763
Some belonged here.

73
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:06,367
Others were outsiders, like you.

74
00:05:22,631 --> 00:05:24,913
Yeah, see, I was part of that world.

75
00:05:25,253 --> 00:05:31,037
It's a world of closed doors and things being off limits.

76
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:34,779
But that world's over.

77
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,081
This has all happened before.

78
00:05:39,182 --> 00:05:41,183
Soon, we'll all be tested.

79
00:05:41,704 --> 00:05:45,186
We'll have to choose how far we'll go to survive.

80
00:05:48,277 --> 00:05:52,199
You don't have to get it, Mackenzie.

81
00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:53,780
You just have to do it.

82
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,283
What I did, the choice I made.

83
00:05:58,543 --> 00:05:59,924
I did it for us.

84
00:06:00,024 --> 00:06:04,006
He'll be back soon enough.

85
00:06:04,087 --> 00:06:06,508
I know when he is.

86
00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:08,329
I'll be ready.

87
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:09,430
Holy shit, wait!

88
00:06:15,034 --> 00:06:16,436
They left her, didn't they?

89
00:06:17,196 --> 00:06:19,699
She needed help, and they let her go.

90
00:06:22,161 --> 00:06:25,565
This is how you make it right.

91
00:06:52,061 --> 00:07:19,249
Alright, so thanks for coming.

92
00:07:19,269 --> 00:07:20,329
I hope you learned a lot today.

93
00:07:22,548 --> 00:07:23,228
by the lone dark.

94
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,672
All right, let's see if we can do this correctly.

95
00:07:27,692 --> 00:07:30,834
Does this look great to you?

96
00:07:30,914 --> 00:07:32,075
Yes, okay, great.

97
00:07:32,455 --> 00:07:34,877
So, hi.

98
00:07:36,198 --> 00:07:37,199
My name's Raphael Van Lierp.

99
00:07:37,219 --> 00:07:38,960
I'm the founder and creative director at Hinterland

100
00:07:39,681 --> 00:07:40,821
and the creator of the lone dark.

101
00:07:41,782 --> 00:07:43,804
I'm here to share with you my thoughts and experiences

102
00:07:44,024 --> 00:07:46,526
around the challenges of blending two types of narrative.

103
00:07:47,472 --> 00:07:49,513
the authored story, and the playered story,

104
00:07:50,234 --> 00:07:52,275
a problem that's fairly unique to the interactive space,

105
00:07:53,096 --> 00:07:55,917
and in a genre not well-known for its narrative potential,

106
00:07:56,638 --> 00:07:58,219
the sandbox survival game.

107
00:08:01,721 --> 00:08:02,561
But before I get into that,

108
00:08:02,581 --> 00:08:04,442
I'd like to thank the GDC Selection Committee

109
00:08:04,462 --> 00:08:06,784
and the Advisory Board, and in particular, Clint Hawking,

110
00:08:06,864 --> 00:08:09,065
for inviting me to speak here at the main conference.

111
00:08:10,372 --> 00:08:12,313
This is my third time presenting at GDC,

112
00:08:12,453 --> 00:08:14,033
and it's always an honor to stand amongst

113
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:16,875
and in front of such distinguished creators

114
00:08:17,135 --> 00:08:19,276
and survivors of game development.

115
00:08:21,677 --> 00:08:23,278
I'd also like to thank my team at Hinterland,

116
00:08:23,438 --> 00:08:26,339
some of who are sitting in the audience today, back there.

117
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,001
So, if there's things you don't like about the game.

118
00:08:32,842 --> 00:08:33,963
And without whom I wouldn't have much

119
00:08:34,003 --> 00:08:35,103
to stand up here and talk about.

120
00:08:39,387 --> 00:08:41,208
I'm gonna start with the standard GDC caveats.

121
00:08:41,609 --> 00:08:43,530
I'm not a lawyer and forgive me if this sounds like

122
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,771
disclaimers against litigation,

123
00:08:46,351 --> 00:08:48,493
but really this is about creating a safe space

124
00:08:49,293 --> 00:08:51,114
within which to share information and ideas.

125
00:08:51,815 --> 00:08:53,295
This caveat allows me to feel comfortable

126
00:08:53,335 --> 00:08:55,117
in sharing my experiences with you today

127
00:08:55,177 --> 00:08:57,118
without the pressure of feeling like

128
00:08:57,298 --> 00:08:59,679
I'm trying to teach you or influence you in some way.

129
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,901
I'm merely here to share the benefit

130
00:09:03,161 --> 00:09:04,422
of some lessons hard won.

131
00:09:05,343 --> 00:09:07,344
It's up to you then to decide if this information

132
00:09:07,584 --> 00:09:08,504
is of any use to you.

133
00:09:09,555 --> 00:09:11,276
If you wish to embrace it, great.

134
00:09:12,237 --> 00:09:13,657
And I hope it helps guide you to success

135
00:09:13,697 --> 00:09:14,518
in your own projects.

136
00:09:15,438 --> 00:09:18,039
If you wish to run away from it, also great.

137
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,482
Perhaps I helped you to avoid some very painful experiences

138
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:24,723
or inspired you to blaze a much better path forward

139
00:09:24,743 --> 00:09:25,583
for your own project.

140
00:09:32,106 --> 00:09:34,227
We can't really talk about player versus author story

141
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,488
without first agreeing on what we mean by story.

142
00:09:37,781 --> 00:09:39,302
For the purposes of this discussion,

143
00:09:39,762 --> 00:09:42,443
I mean story as an architectural construct.

144
00:09:43,384 --> 00:09:44,725
It's a set of consecutive moments

145
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,666
that are imbued with meaning due to their context.

146
00:09:49,307 --> 00:09:50,968
While game mechanics are the building blocks

147
00:09:51,148 --> 00:09:52,289
of the gameplay experience,

148
00:09:53,029 --> 00:09:56,051
that is what the player does in the game,

149
00:09:57,051 --> 00:09:59,093
story is what emerges when you give

150
00:09:59,133 --> 00:10:01,174
these moment-to-moment experiences meaning

151
00:10:01,974 --> 00:10:04,896
by how you think about them, how you feel about them,

152
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,621
and how you talk about them with other people.

153
00:10:13,526 --> 00:10:14,988
But how you feel about your experience

154
00:10:15,728 --> 00:10:16,629
can be heavily determined

155
00:10:16,669 --> 00:10:18,451
by your sense of authorship over it.

156
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:21,553
If I present to you a well-crafted story

157
00:10:21,573 --> 00:10:22,794
that you happily submit to,

158
00:10:24,616 --> 00:10:25,557
you'll come along for the ride

159
00:10:25,577 --> 00:10:27,158
and feel a strong sense of connection

160
00:10:27,699 --> 00:10:28,760
to what you have experienced.

161
00:10:29,891 --> 00:10:32,092
We've all played linear games that were extremely well done

162
00:10:32,672 --> 00:10:34,033
to the extent that we didn't notice,

163
00:10:34,473 --> 00:10:36,554
or at least if we noticed, we didn't resent

164
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,835
the hand of the author guiding us along.

165
00:10:43,957 --> 00:10:46,078
If on the other hand, you feel that the story

166
00:10:46,138 --> 00:10:49,080
is reducing your sense of authorship over the experience,

167
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,941
the mechanics of the game are at odds

168
00:10:52,181 --> 00:10:54,022
with what the authored experience is trying to convey.

169
00:10:55,092 --> 00:10:57,153
Well, you end up with a dissonance

170
00:10:57,473 --> 00:10:59,095
that can ruin any sense of immersion

171
00:10:59,695 --> 00:11:01,216
you might have otherwise experienced.

172
00:11:02,277 --> 00:11:03,338
And even though you may not be able

173
00:11:03,358 --> 00:11:04,739
to articulate exactly why,

174
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:07,641
the game just won't feel right.

175
00:11:09,763 --> 00:11:11,644
The challenge in providing authored story

176
00:11:11,684 --> 00:11:14,326
as a framework over a game that is heavily biased

177
00:11:14,487 --> 00:11:18,330
towards player experimentation of the gameplay space,

178
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,272
which is the definition of a sandbox survival game,

179
00:11:22,267 --> 00:11:23,387
is in striking the balance

180
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,229
between the different types of story

181
00:11:25,569 --> 00:11:26,609
the player will experience.

182
00:11:33,854 --> 00:11:35,976
In The Long Dark, players experience story

183
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:37,196
across a variety of layers.

184
00:11:38,237 --> 00:11:39,438
Each of these layers is supported

185
00:11:39,478 --> 00:11:41,859
by a kind of narrative scaffolding

186
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,382
that is comprised of all the things you see, hear, do,

187
00:11:47,023 --> 00:11:48,784
and feel as you go through the game.

188
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,895
This is just an opinion, but I feel that players,

189
00:11:53,255 --> 00:11:54,356
I believe that players who feel good

190
00:11:54,376 --> 00:11:55,876
about their experiences in the long dark

191
00:11:57,897 --> 00:12:00,357
enjoy the interplay between these layers.

192
00:12:00,397 --> 00:12:01,798
I hear snow and wind wherever I go.

193
00:12:04,018 --> 00:12:04,338
Always.

194
00:12:06,239 --> 00:12:07,499
Between these layers and find them additive

195
00:12:07,539 --> 00:12:09,240
to the foundational gameplay experience,

196
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,561
which for our game is really 90% about walking around

197
00:12:12,621 --> 00:12:15,522
and strategizing around your rapidly depleting resources.

198
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:22,630
I also believe that some of our approach

199
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:25,312
to isolating these layers into discrete experiences,

200
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:28,534
our sandbox survival mode on one side

201
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:30,395
and our story mode on another,

202
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:34,317
resulted for some players in a narrative experience

203
00:12:34,417 --> 00:12:36,499
that felt at odds with their expectations.

204
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,680
To really understand that,

205
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:41,662
we have to talk about the various layers

206
00:12:41,702 --> 00:12:43,943
of content and systems that generate

207
00:12:43,983 --> 00:12:46,245
what we talk about as the story of the game.

208
00:12:47,493 --> 00:12:49,433
And we also have to talk about our specific approach

209
00:12:49,473 --> 00:12:51,974
in the long dark to presenting these layers

210
00:12:52,034 --> 00:12:53,194
to the player over time.

211
00:12:59,396 --> 00:13:00,976
I wanna talk about the layers of story

212
00:13:01,016 --> 00:13:02,137
as I see them in the long dark.

213
00:13:03,117 --> 00:13:05,138
Maybe you can see these layers in your games too.

214
00:13:07,098 --> 00:13:08,398
There's the world story layer,

215
00:13:08,739 --> 00:13:11,239
which is comprised of what the player sees around them

216
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,800
as they explore the playable space.

217
00:13:13,885 --> 00:13:15,646
This is supported by the game's art direction,

218
00:13:15,966 --> 00:13:17,647
environment design, props,

219
00:13:18,227 --> 00:13:20,868
and the remnants of the game world's prior life

220
00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:23,349
before the player arrived to witness it.

221
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,310
So details like signage,

222
00:13:26,271 --> 00:13:28,512
narrative collectibles left behind, or mise-en-scene,

223
00:13:29,152 --> 00:13:30,673
this is the story that emerges

224
00:13:31,133 --> 00:13:33,614
from interacting with the physicality of the world.

225
00:13:40,177 --> 00:13:42,058
World story is heavily implied.

226
00:13:43,183 --> 00:13:46,345
It's a mostly ambient experience that players take in

227
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:48,605
and mostly without thinking about it.

228
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:52,807
And as implied story, it doesn't present itself as such.

229
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:55,207
It's more about look and feel.

230
00:13:55,888 --> 00:13:57,308
And in some cases, it will be described

231
00:13:57,348 --> 00:13:58,749
as the world's personality.

232
00:14:00,849 --> 00:14:02,850
An example of the world story would be our portrayal

233
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:05,591
of the town of Milton in episode one of our story mode.

234
00:14:06,571 --> 00:14:09,432
You can tell just by looking at it that not all is well.

235
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,602
You can tell the world is desolate, rundown, isolated,

236
00:14:15,202 --> 00:14:17,224
and decidedly not modern.

237
00:14:18,164 --> 00:14:20,346
Although you can also tell that you aren't in the 18th

238
00:14:20,366 --> 00:14:23,348
or 19th century due to details like power lines,

239
00:14:23,928 --> 00:14:25,349
solar panels, and cars.

240
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:29,792
For anyone paying attention, these details combine

241
00:14:29,972 --> 00:14:32,614
to create a sense of the game world's prior life.

242
00:14:34,135 --> 00:14:37,176
They serve to draw you into the world and its mysteries.

243
00:14:42,476 --> 00:14:44,057
There's also a system story layer,

244
00:14:44,797 --> 00:14:46,578
which is the story that emerges from the things

245
00:14:46,618 --> 00:14:48,399
the player is doing in the game.

246
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,222
This is mostly about stimuli that force decisions,

247
00:14:52,962 --> 00:14:54,983
the player's manipulation of mechanics,

248
00:14:55,563 --> 00:14:59,025
user interface or controls in trying to execute on decisions

249
00:14:59,826 --> 00:15:01,347
and then the outcomes of those decisions,

250
00:15:01,927 --> 00:15:04,749
always forced by the interminable march

251
00:15:04,829 --> 00:15:07,010
of the game's underlying systems and tuning,

252
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:10,692
which conspire to create a kind of experiential heartbeat.

253
00:15:12,598 --> 00:15:14,899
By my definition, the system's layer of story

254
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,860
is about memorable moments that exist

255
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,421
at the intersection of the game's interactivity.

256
00:15:26,665 --> 00:15:27,685
Everyone who's played The Long Dark

257
00:15:27,705 --> 00:15:29,206
has a story about getting lost in a blizzard.

258
00:15:29,226 --> 00:15:31,827
I'm sure it's happened to most of you at some point.

259
00:15:32,667 --> 00:15:34,869
Nearly dying and then, upon the brink of death,

260
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,150
miraculously encountering a cabin

261
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,331
that seemingly emerged from out of nowhere.

262
00:15:40,751 --> 00:15:41,112
Or a church.

263
00:15:42,929 --> 00:15:45,170
Contrary to popular belief, there is nothing scripted

264
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,492
or intentional about these moments

265
00:15:46,672 --> 00:15:48,093
except that we want them to happen.

266
00:15:49,294 --> 00:15:51,456
These stories emerge from players recounting a moment

267
00:15:51,496 --> 00:15:55,860
in time that at its heart is a purely mechanical process.

268
00:15:57,101 --> 00:15:59,242
The game systems conspire to create this moment,

269
00:15:59,783 --> 00:16:01,184
much like a printing press conspiring

270
00:16:01,204 --> 00:16:02,265
to produce a page of a novel.

271
00:16:03,526 --> 00:16:05,468
But it's the context the player brings

272
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:07,850
to this mechanical process that turns it

273
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:10,552
into something dramatic, giving it meaning.

274
00:16:14,404 --> 00:16:14,744
Oh, geez.

275
00:16:17,246 --> 00:16:18,027
Sit back, there we are.

276
00:16:20,008 --> 00:16:22,010
So here we come to a definition of player story.

277
00:16:23,411 --> 00:16:26,173
Player story is what you get at the intersection

278
00:16:26,534 --> 00:16:28,735
of world and system story layers.

279
00:16:30,057 --> 00:16:32,419
The player can use their intuition and senses

280
00:16:32,979 --> 00:16:35,561
to generate a mental model of what the game world is,

281
00:16:36,222 --> 00:16:38,384
what it might have been before they arrived in it,

282
00:16:39,304 --> 00:16:40,685
and then can use that information

283
00:16:41,026 --> 00:16:43,368
to orient themselves on a visceral level.

284
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,591
Once they engage with systems,

285
00:16:51,031 --> 00:16:52,832
through controls and user interface,

286
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,954
they can start to establish their own presence in the world.

287
00:16:57,034 --> 00:16:59,415
They start to feel some influence over how the world works,

288
00:17:00,096 --> 00:17:01,736
how systems react to their choices.

289
00:17:02,737 --> 00:17:04,898
It's a stimulus and response operation

290
00:17:05,338 --> 00:17:07,579
that increases the player's connection to the game world

291
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,120
with each interaction.

292
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:11,641
Through this process,

293
00:17:12,082 --> 00:17:14,523
the player begins to feel a strong sense of ownership

294
00:17:14,863 --> 00:17:17,044
over the game world and their interactions with it.

295
00:17:18,198 --> 00:17:19,599
They feel that they are shaping the game

296
00:17:20,219 --> 00:17:22,180
and creating their own story along the way.

297
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,701
For some players, their player's story

298
00:17:25,761 --> 00:17:27,802
is the most important expression of narrative.

299
00:17:28,662 --> 00:17:30,663
And it's a much more powerful story for them

300
00:17:31,243 --> 00:17:33,084
than anything we can create.

301
00:17:37,285 --> 00:17:37,745
Cute bunny, eh?

302
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,062
Authored story is different from player's story

303
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:44,743
in that it is a narrative structure

304
00:17:44,983 --> 00:17:47,885
that is imposed upon the game systems and world

305
00:17:47,945 --> 00:17:51,367
by external forces, namely the creator of the game.

306
00:17:52,668 --> 00:17:54,830
This tends to follow more traditional narrative lines

307
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:57,031
such as those we're familiar with from movies or films,

308
00:17:57,332 --> 00:17:59,193
sorry, or novels, movies or novels,

309
00:17:59,633 --> 00:18:01,675
but its primary characteristic is that it is something

310
00:18:01,715 --> 00:18:03,416
that is brought in from the outside,

311
00:18:04,276 --> 00:18:05,877
not something that emerges naturally

312
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:07,919
through the confluence of world and systems.

313
00:18:09,201 --> 00:18:12,062
It's also something that can, for some players,

314
00:18:13,043 --> 00:18:15,004
interfere with the sense of the player story,

315
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,105
because in terms of hierarchy,

316
00:18:17,645 --> 00:18:19,926
the authored story rules overall.

317
00:18:23,808 --> 00:18:26,410
This can be mitigated in games that have extensive systems

318
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:29,791
supporting player choice, and then allowing these choices

319
00:18:29,831 --> 00:18:32,413
to modify authored story in a meaningful way.

320
00:18:33,373 --> 00:18:34,914
Some RPGs are able to do this.

321
00:18:35,627 --> 00:18:38,029
for example, or in games where players can more or less

322
00:18:38,289 --> 00:18:41,152
opt out of the authored story and continue to experience

323
00:18:41,172 --> 00:18:45,055
the game primarily along the system and world story layers.

324
00:18:45,816 --> 00:18:48,178
A lot of open world games like Skyrim or Red Dead Redemption

325
00:18:48,198 --> 00:18:50,099
for example, allow you to do this.

326
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,523
That said, most open world games still impose

327
00:18:54,603 --> 00:18:56,885
an authored narrative structure that even the most

328
00:18:57,185 --> 00:18:59,567
free roaming mechanics focused players

329
00:19:00,007 --> 00:19:01,348
will eventually bump up against.

330
00:19:02,661 --> 00:19:05,043
Minecraft is one of the few open-world games

331
00:19:05,483 --> 00:19:07,165
that comes to mind that exists primarily

332
00:19:07,265 --> 00:19:08,846
on the systems and world layer

333
00:19:09,507 --> 00:19:11,549
and eschews authored story entirely.

334
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,411
But I think it's generally true

335
00:19:14,912 --> 00:19:17,474
that for any game that has an intentional authored narrative

336
00:19:18,435 --> 00:19:20,617
this authored narrative supersedes the player story

337
00:19:21,938 --> 00:19:23,939
in the sense that even if you want to ignore it,

338
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,402
you'll likely need to engage with it at some point

339
00:19:26,902 --> 00:19:27,623
if you want to progress.

340
00:19:31,888 --> 00:19:33,709
So why bother with authored narrative at all?

341
00:19:34,789 --> 00:19:37,370
When done poorly, it can conflict with your system story,

342
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:40,271
and frankly, it's a lot easier and more cost-effective

343
00:19:40,691 --> 00:19:43,012
to create experiences primarily through systems

344
00:19:43,492 --> 00:19:44,993
than through authored narrative content.

345
00:19:46,753 --> 00:19:48,974
Well, I think the truth is that traditional stories

346
00:19:49,034 --> 00:19:49,714
work for a reason.

347
00:19:50,454 --> 00:19:51,695
We're hardwired to understand them,

348
00:19:51,735 --> 00:19:53,915
and the context they provide is an important way

349
00:19:54,135 --> 00:19:57,256
of adding meaning to events which can otherwise feel

350
00:19:58,657 --> 00:19:59,317
kind of pointless.

351
00:20:00,542 --> 00:20:01,783
And while there's certainly a type of player

352
00:20:01,803 --> 00:20:03,064
who prefers their own story

353
00:20:03,404 --> 00:20:05,045
to the one a development team might come up with,

354
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:07,466
a constituency that's grown a lot

355
00:20:07,927 --> 00:20:09,127
over the last 10 years or so,

356
00:20:09,628 --> 00:20:11,929
this is essentially the Minecraft generation.

357
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,471
A lot of players just can't be bothered.

358
00:20:16,672 --> 00:20:18,293
They feel lost without the benefit

359
00:20:18,353 --> 00:20:20,054
of some overarching storyline.

360
00:20:22,115 --> 00:20:23,216
And they take comfort in knowing

361
00:20:23,396 --> 00:20:24,597
that someone has put some thought

362
00:20:24,677 --> 00:20:27,459
into why they are there, what they are doing,

363
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:30,120
and how it's all going to come together in the end.

364
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:38,202
Any X-Files fans here, Lost fans here?

365
00:20:39,803 --> 00:20:41,124
Remember when X-Files first came out,

366
00:20:41,144 --> 00:20:42,666
not the garbage that they're putting out now,

367
00:20:42,686 --> 00:20:45,668
but the first, let's say, five seasons

368
00:20:45,688 --> 00:20:46,849
that were really good, okay?

369
00:20:46,989 --> 00:20:49,612
Or Lost, anyone ever got into Lost, big way, yeah?

370
00:20:50,953 --> 00:20:52,294
Do you remember the moment you realized

371
00:20:52,454 --> 00:20:55,417
that the creators didn't really have a clue

372
00:20:55,437 --> 00:20:56,438
where they were going with the story?

373
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,420
The moment you realized that we were just

374
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,162
kind of making shit up as they went along, right?

375
00:21:02,133 --> 00:21:03,794
That was the moment you probably, like me,

376
00:21:03,894 --> 00:21:05,714
threw your hands up in the air and said, screw this.

377
00:21:07,415 --> 00:21:09,556
Why was that moment upsetting to us?

378
00:21:10,556 --> 00:21:13,037
Because an authored story is taking us along for a ride,

379
00:21:13,658 --> 00:21:15,578
and it's a ride we're willingly submitting to

380
00:21:15,639 --> 00:21:18,360
because we think we're being taken somewhere interesting.

381
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,761
So you know, it better be going somewhere interesting.

382
00:21:22,221 --> 00:21:24,222
And if you stop believing in the tour conductors,

383
00:21:24,842 --> 00:21:25,383
well, it's done.

384
00:21:25,863 --> 00:21:27,083
The illusion is broken.

385
00:21:27,644 --> 00:21:28,704
The magic is lost.

386
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:30,852
You see behind the curtain,

387
00:21:31,052 --> 00:21:32,633
and there's no point going any further.

388
00:21:38,937 --> 00:21:40,478
I love that GDC is happening

389
00:21:40,498 --> 00:21:41,919
in the middle of all this awesome construction.

390
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,240
To be clear, in this talk,

391
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,642
I'm talking about player story and authored story

392
00:21:45,702 --> 00:21:47,883
in a solo survival game, okay?

393
00:21:48,304 --> 00:21:50,045
Multiplayer is a completely different beast.

394
00:21:50,762 --> 00:21:53,283
Multiplayer games are almost entirely, in my opinion,

395
00:21:53,303 --> 00:21:55,744
about system story, with the added context

396
00:21:55,824 --> 00:21:58,184
of playing against other humans rather than AI

397
00:21:58,605 --> 00:22:00,985
being the thing that provides meaning to the system story.

398
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:05,467
I think of multiplayer story more like

399
00:22:05,507 --> 00:22:06,807
participating in a sport.

400
00:22:07,787 --> 00:22:09,628
Your story there is about your performance,

401
00:22:09,948 --> 00:22:13,889
close calls, near misses, dramatic goals or saves, and so on.

402
00:22:16,147 --> 00:22:17,527
I don't play a lot of multiplayer games,

403
00:22:17,568 --> 00:22:20,389
but I recall a lot of rounds of Co-op Halo or Left 4 Dead

404
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:22,831
that were tremendously memorable experiences

405
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:25,132
because of the reaction from the other humans

406
00:22:25,533 --> 00:22:26,193
I was playing with.

407
00:22:27,294 --> 00:22:29,115
But that gets into a whole other realm of motivations

408
00:22:29,175 --> 00:22:30,756
and psychology around player story

409
00:22:31,136 --> 00:22:32,637
that we don't really have time to get into right now.

410
00:22:33,358 --> 00:22:35,799
Suffice it to say that for the purposes of this talk today,

411
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,540
we're focusing on solo games.

412
00:22:38,861 --> 00:22:40,022
And speaking of solo games,

413
00:22:40,722 --> 00:22:42,884
it's time to talk more about the most solo game of all,

414
00:22:43,544 --> 00:22:44,025
The Long Dark.

415
00:22:46,937 --> 00:22:48,938
You're sitting in a lecture hall listening to a talk

416
00:22:48,958 --> 00:22:52,018
with the subject, Blending Player and Authored Story

417
00:22:52,078 --> 00:22:53,379
in a Sandbox Survival Game.

418
00:22:53,899 --> 00:22:55,199
So you might start by asking yourself,

419
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:57,300
what does this guy know about it?

420
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,320
See all this gray hair?

421
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,761
It's actually coming out.

422
00:23:01,941 --> 00:23:04,061
That's mostly come in the last five years or so.

423
00:23:04,621 --> 00:23:06,182
Coincidentally, since I founded Hinterland,

424
00:23:06,222 --> 00:23:07,982
it started working on the game

425
00:23:08,002 --> 00:23:09,003
that would become The Long Dark.

426
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:11,983
If you'll allow me to stroll down memory lane,

427
00:23:12,303 --> 00:23:13,644
and I promise you this is a journey

428
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,744
with an intentional ending,

429
00:23:15,738 --> 00:23:19,601
I'd like to recount for you some of the history of the Long Dark's development and how certain

430
00:23:19,641 --> 00:23:24,663
choices along the way had a dramatic impact on our approach to player versus authored

431
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:25,083
narrative.

432
00:23:26,664 --> 00:23:28,445
And I might just spare you some gray hairs in the process.

433
00:23:32,447 --> 00:23:35,529
My first concept of the Long Dark was a tablet game called Survival Story.

434
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,081
We built a prototype on iPad,

435
00:23:38,181 --> 00:23:40,163
which let you navigate a simple top-down map

436
00:23:40,523 --> 00:23:43,004
and select points of interest or locations to explore,

437
00:23:43,565 --> 00:23:44,966
at which point the game would transition

438
00:23:45,046 --> 00:23:47,868
to a small 3D scene the player could move around in.

439
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:50,269
It didn't take long to realize

440
00:23:50,289 --> 00:23:52,310
that this form of presentation would be too limiting

441
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:53,972
for an experience that was meant to be 90%

442
00:23:55,132 --> 00:23:56,453
about immersive exploration,

443
00:23:57,114 --> 00:23:58,755
so we quickly shifted our focus

444
00:23:58,775 --> 00:24:00,596
to creating something for PC and Steam.

445
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:05,272
This was back in 2013, and you have to remember

446
00:24:05,292 --> 00:24:06,593
that Steam, while impressive

447
00:24:06,713 --> 00:24:08,274
as a digital distribution platform,

448
00:24:08,695 --> 00:24:10,976
didn't feel quite as omnipresent as it does today.

449
00:24:12,177 --> 00:24:14,058
Everyone, it seemed at that time, however,

450
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:15,980
was developing games for iOS.

451
00:24:17,441 --> 00:24:18,341
It was a new gold rush.

452
00:24:18,922 --> 00:24:21,423
So to step away from the platform that seemed to be ascendant

453
00:24:21,804 --> 00:24:25,626
for the more pokey-feeling PC felt like a big risk.

454
00:24:26,567 --> 00:24:27,908
Don't forget, this was still the era

455
00:24:27,928 --> 00:24:30,770
when analysts brazenly predicted the death of the PC.

456
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:33,230
Still hasn't happened, by the way.

457
00:24:34,011 --> 00:24:37,393
In any case, PC felt right for the kind of experience

458
00:24:37,774 --> 00:24:39,975
we wanted to deliver, and Steam meant we could find

459
00:24:39,995 --> 00:24:41,196
an audience without a publisher,

460
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,778
and satisfying these two needs was enough

461
00:24:43,818 --> 00:24:44,799
to merit this way forward.

462
00:24:48,301 --> 00:24:51,063
Most of the team at Hinterland, back then as today,

463
00:24:51,684 --> 00:24:53,986
came to Hinterland after long stints making games

464
00:24:54,126 --> 00:24:55,647
in the AAA side of the industry,

465
00:24:56,227 --> 00:24:58,329
which meant we didn't really know anything

466
00:24:58,369 --> 00:24:59,089
about social media.

467
00:25:00,201 --> 00:25:01,302
Streaming wasn't really a thing,

468
00:25:01,942 --> 00:25:03,443
and our primary experience of community

469
00:25:03,503 --> 00:25:04,925
was the occasional piece of fan mail,

470
00:25:05,825 --> 00:25:07,546
like literal mail, like physical stuff

471
00:25:07,566 --> 00:25:10,309
they send in the mail, that would get sent in

472
00:25:10,329 --> 00:25:12,170
and posted on a bulletin board for all of us to see.

473
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:15,452
The point here is, we were building along dark

474
00:25:15,532 --> 00:25:18,214
in an environment where community was becoming a thing.

475
00:25:19,415 --> 00:25:21,517
Nobody really knew what it meant or what one was,

476
00:25:22,377 --> 00:25:23,598
but we knew that we needed one.

477
00:25:24,719 --> 00:25:26,861
And a lot of studios kickstarted the creation

478
00:25:26,881 --> 00:25:29,603
of their communities using, well, Kickstarter.

479
00:25:32,777 --> 00:25:33,378
And we did too.

480
00:25:34,819 --> 00:25:36,220
We launched a Kickstarter campaign,

481
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,682
experienced 30 days of terrible anxiety,

482
00:25:39,403 --> 00:25:40,103
and in the end we raised $250,000

483
00:25:40,764 --> 00:25:43,386
and gained a community of nearly 7,000 backers.

484
00:25:44,967 --> 00:25:45,948
And this was amazing for us

485
00:25:45,988 --> 00:25:47,529
and our first wonderful experience

486
00:25:47,949 --> 00:25:49,751
of being front and center with our community

487
00:25:50,451 --> 00:25:52,193
as opposed to interacting from behind the shield

488
00:25:52,233 --> 00:25:53,674
of the marketing and PR departments

489
00:25:54,174 --> 00:25:55,896
that we were accustomed to from our AAA days.

490
00:25:56,816 --> 00:25:59,018
And I think we got a bit excited.

491
00:26:00,213 --> 00:26:03,095
maybe even a bit addicted to the idea of having fans

492
00:26:03,155 --> 00:26:05,056
and feedback for the things we were doing.

493
00:26:08,918 --> 00:26:11,180
Our Kickstarter was for a heavily story-driven

494
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,441
survival experience about a bush pilot

495
00:26:13,481 --> 00:26:16,603
named Will McKenzie who'd crash in the Canadian wilderness

496
00:26:17,143 --> 00:26:19,765
in the aftermath of a mysterious geomagnetic disaster.

497
00:26:21,186 --> 00:26:21,646
Sound familiar?

498
00:26:22,807 --> 00:26:25,088
And that disaster would render all of our technology inert,

499
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:27,530
thrusting us into a new dark age.

500
00:26:28,384 --> 00:26:30,225
And in the throes of a harsh Canadian winter,

501
00:26:30,785 --> 00:26:32,847
Mackenzie would have to struggle to survive

502
00:26:33,167 --> 00:26:35,148
while managing relationships with other survivors

503
00:26:35,188 --> 00:26:38,350
who were upset at starving and pissed off wolves

504
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:40,652
and not being able to check Facebook and stuff.

505
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:43,354
So with our fresh community in tow,

506
00:26:43,794 --> 00:26:46,055
we embarked on work to take our Kickstarter prototype

507
00:26:46,836 --> 00:26:50,378
and flush it out with more mechanics and content,

508
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,040
with the emphasis being on these intriguing,

509
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,802
post-apocalyptic story moments we'd be delivering

510
00:26:55,842 --> 00:26:57,823
in these amazing 2D animated scenes.

511
00:27:02,228 --> 00:27:03,669
What we quickly realized, however,

512
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:06,490
was that the core of our game, the systems layer,

513
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:08,611
really needed more feedback.

514
00:27:09,911 --> 00:27:11,992
We'd released an early version of our gameplay systems

515
00:27:12,052 --> 00:27:15,913
and world layer, which we refer to as our sandbox,

516
00:27:16,273 --> 00:27:17,673
hinting at its non-narrative roots,

517
00:27:18,214 --> 00:27:19,654
to some of our backers and received

518
00:27:19,694 --> 00:27:21,015
our first playtesting feedback.

519
00:27:21,575 --> 00:27:23,215
And much like the outcome of our successful

520
00:27:23,255 --> 00:27:25,196
Kickstarter campaign, we were heady

521
00:27:25,316 --> 00:27:26,996
with having direct access to our players.

522
00:27:27,617 --> 00:27:29,177
We wanted more feedback.

523
00:27:30,562 --> 00:27:33,023
We also noticed a trend with some of our Kickstarter backers.

524
00:27:33,863 --> 00:27:35,584
Despite giving them an early build to play,

525
00:27:36,025 --> 00:27:38,486
many of them came back to us saying they wanted to wait.

526
00:27:39,747 --> 00:27:41,187
They didn't want to experience the game

527
00:27:41,568 --> 00:27:42,468
before it was finished.

528
00:27:43,308 --> 00:27:45,970
Specifically, they didn't want to experience the game

529
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:48,351
before the story was complete.

530
00:27:52,453 --> 00:27:53,454
So we asked ourselves.

531
00:27:55,145 --> 00:27:56,986
How can we get more players more feedback,

532
00:27:57,347 --> 00:27:59,728
but in such a way that we wouldn't spoil their first time

533
00:27:59,748 --> 00:28:01,709
with The Long Dark, by making them go through

534
00:28:01,729 --> 00:28:04,070
the clumsy first draft of a story experience?

535
00:28:06,211 --> 00:28:08,172
I then landed on a solution that would forever

536
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:11,474
sunder our world and systems layers from our authored layer.

537
00:28:12,034 --> 00:28:14,616
I said, let's separate the mechanics from the story,

538
00:28:15,076 --> 00:28:18,058
release only the mechanics in one region of the game world,

539
00:28:18,378 --> 00:28:20,499
leave just enough info to provide context

540
00:28:20,879 --> 00:28:22,720
for where the player is and why they're there.

541
00:28:23,597 --> 00:28:26,277
but keep all the rest of the real story until it's done.

542
00:28:28,278 --> 00:28:30,519
The intention was to generate more player feedback

543
00:28:30,639 --> 00:28:32,979
on systems while holding back the story

544
00:28:33,019 --> 00:28:34,700
for maximum future impact.

545
00:28:41,342 --> 00:28:43,222
We launched our non-narrative sandbox mode

546
00:28:43,262 --> 00:28:45,943
on Steam Early Access on September 22nd, 2014,

547
00:28:46,303 --> 00:28:49,584
and it kind of took off for us.

548
00:28:50,564 --> 00:28:51,885
In our first three months, we had 250,000 players.

549
00:28:53,843 --> 00:28:55,364
In our first year, we had half a million.

550
00:28:56,285 --> 00:28:57,846
By the time we launched our first episodes

551
00:28:57,886 --> 00:28:59,227
of Story Mode last August,

552
00:28:59,667 --> 00:29:01,648
nearly three years after launching our sandbox

553
00:29:01,688 --> 00:29:04,871
on early access, we had over one and a half million players

554
00:29:05,251 --> 00:29:06,632
across Steam and Xbox One.

555
00:29:07,653 --> 00:29:09,654
Today, we have over two million players

556
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:11,836
across all platforms, and we still have

557
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,877
three remaining episodes of our Story Mode to go.

558
00:29:15,493 --> 00:29:17,615
I won't lie, we didn't anticipate

559
00:29:17,635 --> 00:29:19,315
how big our sandbox experience would become.

560
00:29:19,916 --> 00:29:21,176
We didn't understand how the growth

561
00:29:21,196 --> 00:29:22,377
of the sandbox player community

562
00:29:22,717 --> 00:29:24,558
would essentially dilute our focus

563
00:29:24,898 --> 00:29:25,959
from the game's story mode

564
00:29:26,499 --> 00:29:28,000
to that of trying to support the games,

565
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:31,241
the needs and requests of our rapidly growing community.

566
00:29:35,663 --> 00:29:37,224
And while our original Kickstarter backers

567
00:29:37,264 --> 00:29:39,045
may have fallen in love with the game's premise

568
00:29:39,085 --> 00:29:40,346
and narrative aspirations,

569
00:29:40,986 --> 00:29:42,547
our early access backers were buying

570
00:29:42,587 --> 00:29:44,308
into a non-narrative survival sandbox.

571
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:48,657
Sure, we promised all our backers they'd get all five episodes of our story mode for free,

572
00:29:49,397 --> 00:29:52,399
with their purchase of the game on Early Access or for backing it on Kickstarter,

573
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:57,002
and some percentage of our Early Access players were certainly anticipating the game's story content,

574
00:29:57,363 --> 00:30:00,525
but the truth is that the majority of players who fell in love with The Long Dark

575
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:02,806
fell in love with the game's sandbox mode.

576
00:30:03,827 --> 00:30:06,689
They fell in love with the game's world and systems layers.

577
00:30:07,449 --> 00:30:10,091
They fell in love with their own player stories.

578
00:30:11,502 --> 00:30:14,824
And thus began the struggle, the light side, dark side conflict

579
00:30:15,124 --> 00:30:18,686
that continues to influence and govern the thoughts in many corners of our

580
00:30:18,706 --> 00:30:19,387
community today.

581
00:30:20,447 --> 00:30:22,088
What is the Long Dark really about?

582
00:30:23,269 --> 00:30:24,190
Is it about your stories?

583
00:30:25,451 --> 00:30:26,331
Or is it about my story?

584
00:30:27,092 --> 00:30:27,912
The author's story?

585
00:30:28,372 --> 00:30:29,733
The story I wanted to tell in the game?

586
00:30:34,216 --> 00:30:35,457
Well the good news is it's about both.

587
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:39,011
But as the sandbox experience continued to gain momentum,

588
00:30:39,651 --> 00:30:40,952
I became increasingly frustrated

589
00:30:40,992 --> 00:30:44,014
by how much narrative ownership we were needing to sacrifice

590
00:30:44,454 --> 00:30:47,036
to keep the sandbox engine fueled and functioning.

591
00:30:51,418 --> 00:30:53,720
While the early sandbox regions were intentionally generic,

592
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,661
we started hitting against constraints.

593
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:59,243
The more world and systems we built to sustain the sandbox,

594
00:30:59,743 --> 00:31:01,624
the harder it became to hold on to content

595
00:31:02,104 --> 00:31:04,266
that would be fundamental to making the game's story mode

596
00:31:04,306 --> 00:31:05,586
stand apart from the sandbox.

597
00:31:07,439 --> 00:31:08,320
Why was this important?

598
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,221
Because we wanted to be able to launch twice.

599
00:31:12,442 --> 00:31:14,923
Once with our sandbox and once with our story mode.

600
00:31:15,944 --> 00:31:17,364
We didn't want to lose out on the chance

601
00:31:17,384 --> 00:31:19,245
to do a big reveal of our story content

602
00:31:19,826 --> 00:31:21,207
and we wanted to ensure that by the time

603
00:31:21,227 --> 00:31:22,487
we launched our first episodes,

604
00:31:23,468 --> 00:31:24,468
people would still give a shit.

605
00:31:26,089 --> 00:31:28,110
In order to accomplish this, we needed our story launch

606
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:30,351
to essentially be a whole different experience.

607
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:36,517
And the more we built up the sandbox,

608
00:31:36,557 --> 00:31:38,117
the longer it took to build up the story mode

609
00:31:38,137 --> 00:31:39,317
to the corresponding degree.

610
00:31:39,917 --> 00:31:41,738
Because, well, story was our idea.

611
00:31:41,758 --> 00:31:43,879
It was the reason we'd made the game to begin with.

612
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:47,320
It was, I wanted to present the story of Will McKenzie

613
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,480
and his estranged wife, Dr. Astrid Greenwood,

614
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,861
and share their complicated relationship with players

615
00:31:52,261 --> 00:31:54,902
against the backdrop of a harsh wilderness survival

616
00:31:55,402 --> 00:31:56,482
in this post-apocalyptic,

617
00:31:56,622 --> 00:31:58,863
aurora-illuminated Canadian landscape.

618
00:32:00,092 --> 00:32:01,593
I wanted to create an epic survival story

619
00:32:01,613 --> 00:32:03,255
with a decidedly Canadian context

620
00:32:03,715 --> 00:32:06,798
and a new kind of disaster, a quiet apocalypse,

621
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:09,120
that would be thoughtful and beautiful.

622
00:32:10,341 --> 00:32:11,482
But many of our players were happy

623
00:32:11,502 --> 00:32:12,843
to simply avoid freezing to death

624
00:32:13,323 --> 00:32:14,744
while they tried not to get eaten by wolves.

625
00:32:15,945 --> 00:32:17,406
Many, many times we heard the refrain

626
00:32:17,486 --> 00:32:18,467
and we still hear it today.

627
00:32:19,308 --> 00:32:21,450
I don't care if they spend any more time on story,

628
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,692
I just want more sandbox updates.

629
00:32:24,572 --> 00:32:25,833
Maybe some of you write that.

630
00:32:28,895 --> 00:32:29,235
It's okay.

631
00:32:30,895 --> 00:32:33,356
In order to maximize the impact of our story mode launch,

632
00:32:33,697 --> 00:32:35,537
we kept the game world intentionally generic,

633
00:32:36,157 --> 00:32:38,878
almost as if we wanted it to stand as a placeholder

634
00:32:39,219 --> 00:32:41,119
for what the game would become at full launch.

635
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,881
Regions took on totemic names like Pleasant Valley

636
00:32:44,901 --> 00:32:45,661
and Mystery Lake.

637
00:32:46,641 --> 00:32:48,622
Items had simple names and iconic labels

638
00:32:48,662 --> 00:32:51,063
that left as much as possible to the player's imagination.

639
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:53,904
There was no readable text in the world,

640
00:32:54,364 --> 00:32:55,345
including on signage.

641
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,703
We kept our world story vague and almost impressionistic

642
00:33:00,684 --> 00:33:02,866
to allow maximum mileage in player story.

643
00:33:04,247 --> 00:33:05,829
We do as much as possible to influence

644
00:33:05,849 --> 00:33:07,831
the player's experience of the world and its history

645
00:33:08,431 --> 00:33:09,372
as little as possible.

646
00:33:14,317 --> 00:33:16,278
But in this was my fatal flaw.

647
00:33:16,358 --> 00:33:18,480
Well, not fatal, because clearly I'm still here,

648
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,562
but if I was a character in a novel,

649
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:21,383
it would be my fatal flaw.

650
00:33:22,142 --> 00:33:28,526
Despite this intentional genericism of world story designed to support as much player freedom and ownership of the game experience as possible,

651
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:35,071
I didn't really revise my internal definition for what the authored story of The Long Dark would or should be.

652
00:33:36,893 --> 00:33:40,275
Well, that's not entirely true. I'd actually made it way harder on myself and my team.

653
00:33:40,896 --> 00:33:45,439
I decided that it wasn't enough to just tell Mackenzie's story. We should also tell Astrid's story.

654
00:33:46,533 --> 00:33:47,955
And we shouldn't tell the story in such a way

655
00:33:47,995 --> 00:33:49,236
that the plot remained the same

656
00:33:49,276 --> 00:33:50,957
whether you select McKenzie or Astrid,

657
00:33:51,578 --> 00:33:53,740
a gender-based selection that would have no real impact

658
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,181
on the story the player would experience.

659
00:33:55,981 --> 00:33:56,982
The mass effect approach,

660
00:33:58,103 --> 00:33:59,004
we would go all the way

661
00:33:59,104 --> 00:34:01,126
and create two entirely different stories.

662
00:34:03,067 --> 00:34:03,328
Yikes.

663
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:07,915
Back when the game was called Survival Story,

664
00:34:08,115 --> 00:34:09,595
the narrative would be delivered primarily

665
00:34:09,635 --> 00:34:11,936
in these motion graphic styled cinematic scenes.

666
00:34:12,556 --> 00:34:14,617
You can see remnants of the style in our first episode,

667
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:16,037
actually, in those flashback sequences

668
00:34:16,097 --> 00:34:17,378
in the hangar and then plane crash.

669
00:34:19,818 --> 00:34:21,139
With basic dialogue trees allowing

670
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:23,159
some fairly simplistic player choice logic.

671
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,760
And while the world would feel relatively open,

672
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:28,141
the narrative structure would be pretty linear.

673
00:34:29,241 --> 00:34:31,242
Much more linear than a truly open world game.

674
00:34:31,802 --> 00:34:34,023
Because back then, Survival Story wasn't really

675
00:34:34,043 --> 00:34:35,763
an open world game like The Long Dark would become.

676
00:34:37,412 --> 00:34:39,274
The point here is, I was still thinking

677
00:34:39,314 --> 00:34:41,176
about the structure of the story being more linear

678
00:34:41,837 --> 00:34:43,419
as it was in its initial iterations

679
00:34:43,459 --> 00:34:44,621
of the project's early days.

680
00:34:45,662 --> 00:34:47,404
And that failure to update the narrative structure

681
00:34:47,445 --> 00:34:48,886
to suit an increasingly open

682
00:34:49,247 --> 00:34:50,809
and free-form player experience

683
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:52,892
created a tension and conflict

684
00:34:52,932 --> 00:34:54,694
in our player experience that persists today.

685
00:34:59,302 --> 00:35:01,402
We were also faced with the fact that our game world,

686
00:35:01,602 --> 00:35:04,103
in the pursuit of supporting the thriving sandbox mode,

687
00:35:04,723 --> 00:35:06,643
had become far too big for us to support

688
00:35:06,763 --> 00:35:09,964
with one holistic chunk of mission and narrative content.

689
00:35:10,864 --> 00:35:12,325
Although I liked the episodic structure

690
00:35:12,365 --> 00:35:14,325
for how it mapped to television-style writing

691
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:16,246
that felt like a great fit for our game,

692
00:35:16,946 --> 00:35:19,126
we ultimately had to find a way to break up our story

693
00:35:19,406 --> 00:35:20,347
into smaller pieces,

694
00:35:20,727 --> 00:35:22,467
because our game had just become too big.

695
00:35:23,973 --> 00:35:26,074
So when we launched the first two episodes of Wintermute,

696
00:35:26,275 --> 00:35:28,997
our story mode, players discovered an experience

697
00:35:29,037 --> 00:35:31,359
that was, well, much more linear

698
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:33,140
than they had become accustomed to having

699
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,321
in their sandbox mode play.

700
00:35:35,722 --> 00:35:37,283
And not at all following the same general

701
00:35:37,723 --> 00:35:40,445
main quest, side quest, directionless wandering paradigm

702
00:35:40,826 --> 00:35:43,288
that games like Fallout and Skyrim had trained them to expect.

703
00:35:48,161 --> 00:35:50,823
Add to that, they'd had three years of player story,

704
00:35:50,943 --> 00:35:53,044
knowing that the authored story would come along someday.

705
00:35:53,725 --> 00:35:55,486
Three years to think up all the ways

706
00:35:55,626 --> 00:35:56,647
in which the story could go.

707
00:35:57,528 --> 00:35:59,049
Three years in which to create their own ideas

708
00:35:59,249 --> 00:36:00,630
of what the story of The Long Dark should be.

709
00:36:02,211 --> 00:36:04,112
And while that wasn't something we could really live up to

710
00:36:04,152 --> 00:36:06,214
in some cases, and even for the people

711
00:36:06,234 --> 00:36:09,016
who may not have had such stratospheric expectations

712
00:36:09,576 --> 00:36:10,797
about the game's narrative mode,

713
00:36:11,418 --> 00:36:13,719
imposing a strictly linear mission and narrative structure

714
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:14,760
on what for many of them

715
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,442
was a vastly open world survival sandbox.

716
00:36:18,402 --> 00:36:19,463
Well, this just didn't work.

717
00:36:20,784 --> 00:36:22,024
It wasn't what they were expecting.

718
00:36:22,705 --> 00:36:24,225
It wasn't how other open world games blended

719
00:36:24,245 --> 00:36:25,586
their player's story and author's story.

720
00:36:26,146 --> 00:36:28,248
Essentially, we had gone against the true nature

721
00:36:28,668 --> 00:36:29,708
of what the game had become

722
00:36:30,449 --> 00:36:32,410
and forced an adventure game narrative structure

723
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:34,151
onto what had become a very open,

724
00:36:34,751 --> 00:36:36,912
very free form sandbox experience.

725
00:36:40,354 --> 00:36:41,595
Now, not all was lost, of course.

726
00:36:42,215 --> 00:36:44,297
While some people were frustrated with the new constraints,

727
00:36:44,537 --> 00:36:46,158
others embraced the goals and context

728
00:36:46,198 --> 00:36:47,658
provided by the game's narrative mode.

729
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,816
While some players found that the game could never live up

730
00:36:50,836 --> 00:36:52,517
to the stories they had made up in their own heads,

731
00:36:53,157 --> 00:36:54,398
others found it a pleasant diversion

732
00:36:54,438 --> 00:36:55,598
from the game's sandbox mode,

733
00:36:55,998 --> 00:36:57,999
something to jump into as a kind of palate cleanser

734
00:36:58,239 --> 00:36:59,880
before moving back into a challenging

735
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,841
100-day interloper game.

736
00:37:02,841 --> 00:37:04,762
Still others found the story mode provided the game

737
00:37:04,842 --> 00:37:06,582
with the necessary narrative momentum

738
00:37:07,063 --> 00:37:09,204
that the sandbox mode was sorely lacking for them.

739
00:37:10,124 --> 00:37:11,865
The story gave them a reason to play.

740
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:19,032
One thing we've realized since we launched our episodes

741
00:37:19,072 --> 00:37:22,195
last August is that this dissonance between expectations

742
00:37:22,235 --> 00:37:23,957
set up by the game's sandbox experience

743
00:37:24,297 --> 00:37:25,798
and what we delivered in our story mode

744
00:37:26,279 --> 00:37:27,961
were largely a function of our lengthy

745
00:37:28,281 --> 00:37:29,342
early access campaign.

746
00:37:30,603 --> 00:37:32,245
We found that players who've jumped into the game

747
00:37:32,285 --> 00:37:34,106
since we launched our 1.0 with Wintermute

748
00:37:34,667 --> 00:37:37,169
actually play the story episodes as a kind of tutorial

749
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:39,571
in preparation for the game's more challenging

750
00:37:39,932 --> 00:37:40,973
sandbox survival mode.

751
00:37:44,319 --> 00:37:46,119
This works as intended since the story mode

752
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,440
not only introduces mechanics in a safer context,

753
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,300
thus softening the hard entry

754
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,881
into our permadeath survival mode,

755
00:37:52,621 --> 00:37:55,362
but also allows players to take all the world layer context

756
00:37:55,682 --> 00:37:58,042
from story mode with them into survival mode.

757
00:37:59,223 --> 00:38:01,663
Issues with mission linearity aside,

758
00:38:02,083 --> 00:38:03,624
I suspect that if we'd launched our story

759
00:38:03,664 --> 00:38:05,084
and survival mode simultaneously,

760
00:38:05,624 --> 00:38:07,505
rather than with a three year interval between them,

761
00:38:08,145 --> 00:38:09,265
this perceived disconnect

762
00:38:09,465 --> 00:38:10,565
wouldn't have really been an issue.

763
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:16,153
The other benefit of launching the first two episodes

764
00:38:16,173 --> 00:38:18,135
of our story mode is that it allowed us the opportunity

765
00:38:18,175 --> 00:38:21,838
to reset expectations about the world layer of the game

766
00:38:22,319 --> 00:38:25,321
by adding more specific information about what happened

767
00:38:25,561 --> 00:38:27,003
before the player arrived,

768
00:38:27,343 --> 00:38:28,944
essentially the world's prior life.

769
00:38:30,306 --> 00:38:33,188
As if to reinforce this, the first region in episode one

770
00:38:33,408 --> 00:38:36,211
was the town of Milton, the first major region

771
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:38,173
in the Long Dark to have a non-generic name.

772
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:41,285
we poured a lot of energy into making Milton

773
00:38:41,305 --> 00:38:42,245
feel like a real place.

774
00:38:43,006 --> 00:38:44,387
And it set a new standard for us

775
00:38:44,847 --> 00:38:47,309
in the level of realization and verisimilitude

776
00:38:47,329 --> 00:38:48,810
we'd achieve with our locations.

777
00:38:50,191 --> 00:38:52,332
We also took the opportunity to add some life

778
00:38:52,392 --> 00:38:55,034
to the world layer by leaving narrative collectibles behind.

779
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:58,496
Notes that would, again, fill in some of the blanks

780
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:00,257
regarding what had happened to the world

781
00:39:00,297 --> 00:39:02,719
of Great Bear Island before you crashed your plane

782
00:39:03,099 --> 00:39:04,580
in the aurora-filled night sky.

783
00:39:09,652 --> 00:39:11,953
One way in which we attempted to unify the system story

784
00:39:11,973 --> 00:39:13,473
and authored story layers in The Long Dark

785
00:39:13,493 --> 00:39:15,334
was through the inclusion of our trust system.

786
00:39:16,434 --> 00:39:18,755
The idea here was that various predetermined narrative

787
00:39:18,895 --> 00:39:21,156
and knowledge breadcrumbs would be unlocked

788
00:39:21,236 --> 00:39:23,877
based on your gaining trust with survivors in the world.

789
00:39:25,038 --> 00:39:27,278
These breadcrumbs could be background on world events,

790
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:31,340
map locations to supply caches, crafting blueprints,

791
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,481
or even skill knowledge that would improve

792
00:39:33,501 --> 00:39:34,801
your capabilities as a survivor.

793
00:39:35,849 --> 00:39:37,670
These gameplay elements were contextualized

794
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:40,892
with story moments, typically dressed up with lore

795
00:39:40,972 --> 00:39:43,533
or backstory to provide at least a thin veneer of meaning

796
00:39:43,993 --> 00:39:45,934
outside of their value to the system's layer.

797
00:39:48,916 --> 00:39:50,116
In order to gain trust, however,

798
00:39:50,497 --> 00:39:52,858
the player has to provide the NPC survivor with supplies,

799
00:39:53,498 --> 00:39:56,300
resources they can't get on their own.

800
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:59,001
And gathering these resources requires the player engage

801
00:39:59,361 --> 00:40:02,103
with the game's core exploration survival systems loops.

802
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:05,456
It's similar to the relationship mission progression has

803
00:40:05,476 --> 00:40:07,517
to narrative content in most games with a story.

804
00:40:08,077 --> 00:40:10,218
In a mission, you are provided with narrative context,

805
00:40:10,618 --> 00:40:13,159
a reason for why an NPC needs something from you.

806
00:40:14,219 --> 00:40:15,480
You then engage with game systems

807
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,040
in order to achieve the stated goals,

808
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:19,481
and your reward is typically some gameplay benefit,

809
00:40:19,581 --> 00:40:20,881
loot, progression, et cetera.

810
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:22,642
And then also the unlocking

811
00:40:22,662 --> 00:40:24,243
of the next beat of narrative context.

812
00:40:24,743 --> 00:40:26,123
That's not unique to The Long Dark,

813
00:40:26,143 --> 00:40:27,624
that's just a general structure.

814
00:40:28,748 --> 00:40:30,228
Trust plays with the same structure

815
00:40:30,268 --> 00:40:32,269
but streamlines it to its very essence.

816
00:40:32,849 --> 00:40:33,890
The context is simple.

817
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:36,131
The goal is often something that the player needs,

818
00:40:36,511 --> 00:40:38,712
and in the process of trying to satisfy the objectives

819
00:40:39,192 --> 00:40:41,373
outlined by the narrative context,

820
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:43,773
the player engages in the core systems loop,

821
00:40:44,094 --> 00:40:46,695
which then produces new opportunities for player story

822
00:40:48,515 --> 00:40:49,896
via the systems interactions.

823
00:40:52,217 --> 00:40:54,197
Unfortunately, in our current implementation,

824
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:55,778
many players found the trust content

825
00:40:55,798 --> 00:40:56,958
to feel very fetch-quest-y.

826
00:40:57,817 --> 00:41:01,761
In the context of a survival experience, it makes sense that NPCs are often weaker than you,

827
00:41:02,162 --> 00:41:03,903
which are to get you to take risks on their behalf.

828
00:41:04,604 --> 00:41:09,589
And in a world of resource scarcity, the challenge of obtaining food, fuel, and other supplies

829
00:41:09,629 --> 00:41:14,414
to help ensure someone else's survival, potentially at the cost of your own success,

830
00:41:14,975 --> 00:41:18,738
creates an interesting tension, and is thematically very relevant to our world.

831
00:41:20,282 --> 00:41:21,243
It's relevant to our game world,

832
00:41:21,283 --> 00:41:22,544
but I guess it's relevant to the real world too.

833
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:24,465
It was also a way for us to differentiate

834
00:41:24,485 --> 00:41:27,427
between the survival mode, an ultra egocentric experience

835
00:41:27,747 --> 00:41:29,789
where you only have to worry about your own needs,

836
00:41:30,509 --> 00:41:32,931
to the challenges of having to consider the balancing

837
00:41:33,011 --> 00:41:34,853
of your needs against the needs of other people

838
00:41:35,173 --> 00:41:37,935
you encounter in the world, many who need your help.

839
00:41:38,935 --> 00:41:40,416
How far will you go to survive?

840
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:44,990
It's probably a testament to how systems-focused Trust felt

841
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:47,411
and the fact that we treated it individually

842
00:41:47,431 --> 00:41:48,752
from the rest of our dialogue, narrative,

843
00:41:48,792 --> 00:41:50,473
and mission content, that it presented

844
00:41:50,573 --> 00:41:52,173
as a thinly-veiled progression system.

845
00:41:53,214 --> 00:41:55,975
In future iterations, we're making Trust more integrated

846
00:41:56,015 --> 00:41:58,196
into the core experience of interacting with NPCs,

847
00:41:58,656 --> 00:42:00,797
and I still believe that as an experiment

848
00:42:00,857 --> 00:42:03,358
in blending player story, system story,

849
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:05,079
and authored story into a single system,

850
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:07,740
Trust netted some pretty interesting results.

851
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:14,271
While the decision to split the game into sandbox

852
00:42:14,311 --> 00:42:16,873
and story modes allowed us to confidently launch

853
00:42:16,913 --> 00:42:18,974
our early access campaign without fear of spoiling

854
00:42:18,995 --> 00:42:20,376
the story content for our players,

855
00:42:21,216 --> 00:42:22,818
and to be clear I think that was the right call

856
00:42:22,878 --> 00:42:24,599
given that I don't think heavily narrative games

857
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,941
generally do well in the early access model.

858
00:42:27,562 --> 00:42:29,543
I think we ended up breaking with open world conventions

859
00:42:29,603 --> 00:42:30,204
in doing so.

860
00:42:31,305 --> 00:42:32,966
We created a split between our more heavily

861
00:42:33,026 --> 00:42:35,288
narrative focused experience and our more heavily

862
00:42:35,348 --> 00:42:37,029
systems focused sandbox experience.

863
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:38,851
Whereas most open world games allow

864
00:42:38,871 --> 00:42:40,072
the two approaches to coexist.

865
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:42,945
leaving it up to the player to choose for themselves

866
00:42:43,427 --> 00:42:45,475
what type of content they prefer to engage with.

867
00:42:49,399 --> 00:42:50,980
There have been some sandbox survival experiences

868
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,541
who have managed to introduce their narrative mode

869
00:42:52,561 --> 00:42:53,742
while still in early access.

870
00:42:54,122 --> 00:42:56,663
The Forest and Subnautica come to mind as examples

871
00:42:56,683 --> 00:42:57,644
where this has been done well.

872
00:42:58,144 --> 00:43:00,045
And both those games have been able to integrate

873
00:43:00,085 --> 00:43:01,106
their narrative modes directly

874
00:43:01,126 --> 00:43:02,627
into their core open world sandbox.

875
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:05,508
For our game, however, we found that by the time

876
00:43:05,528 --> 00:43:07,069
we had a strong handle on what an episode

877
00:43:07,089 --> 00:43:08,550
for The Long Dark would look and play like,

878
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:11,972
the game had already essentially become, well, two games.

879
00:43:13,433 --> 00:43:14,994
The strongest expression of this difference

880
00:43:15,174 --> 00:43:17,095
is in the way we handle player failure and saves.

881
00:43:17,883 --> 00:43:19,545
In story mode, you can save anywhere,

882
00:43:20,226 --> 00:43:21,687
and failure can more or less be remedied

883
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:23,509
by reloading from an earlier save point.

884
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:25,672
But survival mode is permadeath.

885
00:43:26,333 --> 00:43:28,415
If you die, we delete your save.

886
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:30,818
And the risk of the game's permadeath nature

887
00:43:30,938 --> 00:43:32,620
is frankly one of its core strengths.

888
00:43:33,521 --> 00:43:35,323
The danger of loss is what lends meaning

889
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:37,305
to the system's story in survival mode.

890
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,121
Combining story and survival modes

891
00:43:40,161 --> 00:43:41,681
into one open world survival experience

892
00:43:41,701 --> 00:43:43,242
would have unified the two approaches,

893
00:43:43,702 --> 00:43:45,383
but removing permadeath from survival mode

894
00:43:45,743 --> 00:43:46,963
or adding it to story mode

895
00:43:47,423 --> 00:43:49,104
would destroy the spirit of each experience

896
00:43:49,164 --> 00:43:51,785
and frankly, result in a worse game for everyone.

897
00:43:52,845 --> 00:43:55,046
So this reunification is just not possible for us,

898
00:43:55,786 --> 00:43:57,427
given how our game has evolved over time.

899
00:43:58,527 --> 00:44:00,268
So while I think that our approach has taken us

900
00:44:00,308 --> 00:44:02,388
outside the standard conventions of open world games,

901
00:44:02,969 --> 00:44:03,989
we're committed to making it work

902
00:44:04,009 --> 00:44:05,990
for the remainder of our five episode story mode.

903
00:44:09,052 --> 00:44:11,034
That said, this doesn't mean we're happily standing still.

904
00:44:11,874 --> 00:44:12,895
One of the things you quickly learn

905
00:44:12,915 --> 00:44:15,257
about making sandbox survival games in an open development

906
00:44:15,597 --> 00:44:17,179
and community-focused environment is,

907
00:44:17,759 --> 00:44:19,460
you're only as good as your last update.

908
00:44:20,521 --> 00:44:22,403
And after over four years of highly iterative

909
00:44:22,543 --> 00:44:24,544
open development on The Long Dark,

910
00:44:24,624 --> 00:44:26,726
the team at Hinterland is now heavily optimized

911
00:44:26,826 --> 00:44:28,687
for this particular development methodology.

912
00:44:29,548 --> 00:44:32,230
In other words, we can't leave well enough alone.

913
00:44:33,983 --> 00:44:35,144
So we're working on several things

914
00:44:35,184 --> 00:44:37,267
to strengthen the relationship between player story

915
00:44:37,647 --> 00:44:39,049
and authored story in the long dark.

916
00:44:39,669 --> 00:44:42,553
Some of these are a bit spoilery, but hey, it's GDC.

917
00:44:42,573 --> 00:44:44,215
You have to get something for your money, right?

918
00:44:47,193 --> 00:44:48,454
We have an episodic story structure

919
00:44:48,474 --> 00:44:50,595
which does introduce some useful constraints for us.

920
00:44:50,835 --> 00:44:52,497
We can present a series of narrative nodes

921
00:44:52,517 --> 00:44:54,558
within a specific physical area,

922
00:44:55,058 --> 00:44:57,120
keeping in mind that the survival mode version of Great Bear

923
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:00,002
has eight major regions, four transition regions,

924
00:45:00,402 --> 00:45:02,324
adding up to over 50 square kilometers

925
00:45:02,724 --> 00:45:05,005
of terrain to explore, which makes it bigger than Skyrim.

926
00:45:05,886 --> 00:45:07,107
Episodes one and two combined

927
00:45:07,167 --> 00:45:08,908
only cover about 20% of this world,

928
00:45:09,689 --> 00:45:10,770
and the world is still growing.

929
00:45:12,185 --> 00:45:13,545
A lot of our narrative and mission structure

930
00:45:13,565 --> 00:45:15,587
for the episodes was actually designed by necessity

931
00:45:16,227 --> 00:45:18,268
to work around the design goal of constraining the player

932
00:45:18,308 --> 00:45:21,049
to specific areas before letting them move on.

933
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:23,571
This is a common technique used in open world games,

934
00:45:23,611 --> 00:45:25,552
but in general, the constraints are softer

935
00:45:25,572 --> 00:45:27,053
and the boundaries are a bit less binary

936
00:45:27,093 --> 00:45:28,073
than in our episodes.

937
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:30,475
Our goal was also to make our story delivery

938
00:45:30,515 --> 00:45:32,456
feel more like a television series than like a film.

939
00:45:33,339 --> 00:45:37,683
So we have hard openings and cliffhanger endings in the episodes to hopefully draw people back in

940
00:45:38,144 --> 00:45:42,488
after they complete each self-contained episode, which to be clear are not telltale sized.

941
00:45:42,568 --> 00:45:44,530
Our episodes are between five and ten hours long.

942
00:45:45,955 --> 00:45:47,295
In any case, one of the things we're doing

943
00:45:47,315 --> 00:45:50,037
to unify player and author story a bit more moving forward

944
00:45:50,077 --> 00:45:51,838
is making our mission structure less linear.

945
00:45:52,418 --> 00:45:54,079
We've actually gone back into our episode one

946
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:56,540
and two mission scripting and opened things up significantly

947
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,341
so that you can now complete most of the major objectives

948
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:00,462
in whatever order you like.

949
00:46:01,182 --> 00:46:03,383
And in some cases, you can completely opt out of mission

950
00:46:03,543 --> 00:46:05,424
threads that were previously mandatory.

951
00:46:07,425 --> 00:46:09,426
We're also redoing the bear hunt for anyone

952
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:11,387
who might wanna know that.

953
00:46:13,349 --> 00:46:15,490
In order to support this increased openness,

954
00:46:15,550 --> 00:46:17,151
we also had to move away from our previous

955
00:46:17,271 --> 00:46:18,592
cinematic presentation style,

956
00:46:18,972 --> 00:46:20,513
where we bookended dialogue sequences

957
00:46:20,553 --> 00:46:22,054
with non-interactive cinematics

958
00:46:22,454 --> 00:46:24,556
towards something that can support enhanced player choice.

959
00:46:26,317 --> 00:46:28,178
We've been working on a new kind of dialogue mode

960
00:46:28,198 --> 00:46:28,838
for The Long Dark,

961
00:46:29,399 --> 00:46:30,399
something that does a better job

962
00:46:30,439 --> 00:46:32,120
of integrating the system layer of the game.

963
00:46:33,182 --> 00:46:36,244
this thing, and it's contextualization within story moments

964
00:46:36,364 --> 00:46:39,326
into interactions with NPCs, and also an interface style

965
00:46:39,346 --> 00:46:42,089
that itself represents the nuance around what it's like

966
00:46:42,109 --> 00:46:44,170
to interact with a character who might be scared

967
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:45,191
or mistrustful of you.

968
00:46:46,052 --> 00:46:47,233
As you can see from this example,

969
00:46:47,593 --> 00:46:49,935
topics sort of float around NPCs like dust moats,

970
00:46:50,295 --> 00:46:52,116
and their position relative to you, their size,

971
00:46:52,196 --> 00:46:54,378
color, and behavior, all indicate something

972
00:46:54,398 --> 00:46:55,119
about their context.

973
00:46:55,962 --> 00:46:59,044
Larger fonts mean these are subjects the NPC really wants to talk to you about.

974
00:46:59,664 --> 00:47:03,967
Locked items suggest topics that are available if only you first satisfy a gameplay requirement.

975
00:47:04,848 --> 00:47:07,950
We use question marks to indicate that this NPC has more to say to you in the future.

976
00:47:09,371 --> 00:47:12,553
And the speed at which some topics move, or the fact that they may fade in and out,

977
00:47:13,373 --> 00:47:15,255
making them hard to select during a conversation,

978
00:47:15,755 --> 00:47:18,777
reflects on an NPC who might be trying to be evasive about something.

979
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:22,654
This approach not only blends the systems layer

980
00:47:22,674 --> 00:47:24,758
and authored layer much more organically,

981
00:47:25,239 --> 00:47:26,942
but it's also scalable and dynamic enough

982
00:47:26,982 --> 00:47:28,825
to be reactive to player choices,

983
00:47:29,446 --> 00:47:31,149
which supports our goal of opening up the mission

984
00:47:31,269 --> 00:47:32,952
and therefore the narrative structure.

985
00:47:36,898 --> 00:47:38,339
Well, I certainly don't recommend that you go back

986
00:47:38,379 --> 00:47:40,260
and spend a lot of time and money redoing content

987
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:41,840
that you already spent a lot of time and money on,

988
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,481
content that a lot of your players have already experienced

989
00:47:44,501 --> 00:47:45,741
and may not want to experience again,

990
00:47:46,502 --> 00:47:49,063
but we see these improvements as important work

991
00:47:49,083 --> 00:47:51,083
for strengthening the foundation of our game

992
00:47:51,943 --> 00:47:54,444
so that we can build a future story episode content

993
00:47:54,824 --> 00:47:56,745
such that the player story and authored story

994
00:47:56,825 --> 00:47:58,186
coexist more cohesively.

995
00:48:01,407 --> 00:48:02,687
So after all this, what comes next?

996
00:48:03,524 --> 00:48:04,905
Well, as far as this presentation goes,

997
00:48:05,165 --> 00:48:06,966
I'd like to leave you with a few high-level takeaways,

998
00:48:07,206 --> 00:48:08,767
things for you to consider in your own projects,

999
00:48:09,248 --> 00:48:10,548
and then with whatever time we have left,

1000
00:48:10,648 --> 00:48:11,669
open the floor to your questions.

1001
00:48:15,171 --> 00:48:17,032
For a lot of players, and this is particularly true

1002
00:48:17,232 --> 00:48:19,754
if you have an open-world-ish or sandbox-ish game,

1003
00:48:20,494 --> 00:48:22,215
their story is a lot more important to them

1004
00:48:22,255 --> 00:48:23,576
than anything you might come up with.

1005
00:48:24,877 --> 00:48:26,158
Make sure that you create tools

1006
00:48:26,198 --> 00:48:28,119
that allow them to influence the game world

1007
00:48:28,199 --> 00:48:30,080
in a way that gives them a sense of ownership.

1008
00:48:31,394 --> 00:48:32,915
In the long dark, we often have players

1009
00:48:33,015 --> 00:48:35,537
post lengthy survival diaries that narrate

1010
00:48:35,817 --> 00:48:38,238
the moment-to-moment mechanics of their sandbox experiences.

1011
00:48:38,879 --> 00:48:40,980
To a lesser degree, players share their experiences

1012
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:42,941
of the story mode, but there's just less for them

1013
00:48:42,981 --> 00:48:45,683
to own there that other players aren't also experiencing.

1014
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:48,471
Our survival sandbox has become an engine

1015
00:48:48,511 --> 00:48:50,871
for memorable moments, which makes it appealing

1016
00:48:50,991 --> 00:48:53,452
for streaming, itself a kind of player storytelling.

1017
00:48:53,992 --> 00:48:55,792
And we have an in-game diary that encourages players

1018
00:48:55,812 --> 00:48:57,912
to keep notes of what they've done each day,

1019
00:48:58,312 --> 00:49:00,653
or remark on where they may have stashed supplies

1020
00:49:00,673 --> 00:49:02,473
or encountered obstacles they'd like to come back to

1021
00:49:02,533 --> 00:49:03,413
when they're in better shape.

1022
00:49:04,434 --> 00:49:06,194
We also think about how to create interesting choices

1023
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:06,994
within our mechanics.

1024
00:49:07,434 --> 00:49:09,014
Things like our rabbit harvesting interaction,

1025
00:49:09,034 --> 00:49:09,955
where you have to make a choice

1026
00:49:09,995 --> 00:49:11,435
about snapping a cute bunny's neck,

1027
00:49:11,915 --> 00:49:13,515
or releasing it and going hungry yourself.

1028
00:49:14,445 --> 00:49:15,706
These are relatively small investments

1029
00:49:15,726 --> 00:49:17,386
from an implementation standpoint,

1030
00:49:17,806 --> 00:49:19,587
but they can create tons of animated discussion

1031
00:49:19,627 --> 00:49:20,387
amongst your community.

1032
00:49:21,167 --> 00:49:22,287
A lot of it in public places

1033
00:49:22,307 --> 00:49:23,948
where other people's curiosity might drive them

1034
00:49:23,968 --> 00:49:24,748
to check out your game.

1035
00:49:25,628 --> 00:49:26,969
In this case, the rabbit harvesting

1036
00:49:26,989 --> 00:49:28,609
also becomes core to the player's story,

1037
00:49:28,969 --> 00:49:31,710
and the choice to harvest or release, as in Bioshock,

1038
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:34,091
is something players will reflect deeply on,

1039
00:49:34,611 --> 00:49:35,951
strengthening their bond with the game.

1040
00:49:37,051 --> 00:49:39,992
The point here is, sometimes small tools

1041
00:49:40,032 --> 00:49:41,773
dedicated to player sharing can go a long way.

1042
00:49:42,768 --> 00:49:44,689
when they are in support of a game with a high index

1043
00:49:44,789 --> 00:49:46,389
of player-generated story moments.

1044
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:50,431
A lot of your players won't be satisfied

1045
00:49:50,451 --> 00:49:51,772
with only having player story.

1046
00:49:52,192 --> 00:49:54,213
Authored story still has a very important role to play

1047
00:49:54,253 --> 00:49:55,674
in setting up overall context

1048
00:49:55,774 --> 00:49:58,855
and providing necessary momentum

1049
00:49:58,895 --> 00:50:00,356
and motivation for player activities.

1050
00:50:01,136 --> 00:50:02,977
If you give players the opportunity to opt out

1051
00:50:03,617 --> 00:50:04,918
of the authored story from time to time

1052
00:50:04,938 --> 00:50:06,018
in ways that feel meaningful,

1053
00:50:06,318 --> 00:50:07,439
then the two approaches to story

1054
00:50:07,479 --> 00:50:08,779
can complement one another nicely.

1055
00:50:09,762 --> 00:50:12,163
This is in fact the true strength of the open world genre.

1056
00:50:12,964 --> 00:50:14,485
And if you don't have the budget for cinematics,

1057
00:50:14,545 --> 00:50:16,126
VO, facial animation, et cetera,

1058
00:50:16,566 --> 00:50:17,627
find a more cost effective way

1059
00:50:17,667 --> 00:50:18,708
to present your narrative moments.

1060
00:50:19,328 --> 00:50:21,009
There are many great examples of how to do this

1061
00:50:21,049 --> 00:50:22,710
across the spectrum of independent games.

1062
00:50:23,251 --> 00:50:24,511
So don't abandon authored narrative

1063
00:50:24,531 --> 00:50:26,113
because you're afraid it will be too expensive.

1064
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:28,234
Consistency is more important

1065
00:50:28,254 --> 00:50:30,055
than hitting a particular presentation style.

1066
00:50:32,874 --> 00:50:34,355
This is less of a note on narrative approach

1067
00:50:34,396 --> 00:50:35,977
and more about general community engagement

1068
00:50:36,277 --> 00:50:37,398
or setting expectations.

1069
00:50:37,899 --> 00:50:39,400
If you're making a sandbox survival game

1070
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,581
in an open development environment

1071
00:50:40,601 --> 00:50:42,203
like early access or game preview,

1072
00:50:42,503 --> 00:50:44,385
be very clear about the kind of game you are making

1073
00:50:44,785 --> 00:50:46,087
when you talk about it with your community.

1074
00:50:46,867 --> 00:50:48,609
We spent nearly four years publicly making

1075
00:50:48,649 --> 00:50:51,031
a super open freeform survival sandbox game

1076
00:50:51,392 --> 00:50:53,053
and at the same time made a narrative mode for it

1077
00:50:53,073 --> 00:50:54,274
that we kept very much in secret.

1078
00:50:55,277 --> 00:50:56,718
Even though we tried to explain that our story mode

1079
00:50:56,738 --> 00:50:57,919
would be different from Sandbox,

1080
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:00,421
for fear of spoiling stuff, we never really articulated

1081
00:51:00,481 --> 00:51:03,283
exactly how our story mode would differ from Sandbox.

1082
00:51:04,003 --> 00:51:06,085
It might be better to give up some of the surprise factor

1083
00:51:06,545 --> 00:51:08,407
and just be more forthcoming about the exact nature

1084
00:51:08,427 --> 00:51:09,307
of your game structure,

1085
00:51:09,748 --> 00:51:11,229
assuming you were holding major stuff back

1086
00:51:11,269 --> 00:51:11,930
from your community.

1087
00:51:12,810 --> 00:51:14,752
I think in general, you can get a community on board

1088
00:51:14,792 --> 00:51:16,293
with pretty major changes to a game,

1089
00:51:16,693 --> 00:51:17,994
provided you ease them into it,

1090
00:51:18,214 --> 00:51:20,076
which in the case of our story mode, we did not do.

1091
00:51:23,499 --> 00:51:25,280
I would never suggest that anyone design a game

1092
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:26,860
specifically to make it more streamable,

1093
00:51:27,681 --> 00:51:29,021
but if your game naturally lends itself

1094
00:51:29,041 --> 00:51:30,362
to this type of player storytelling,

1095
00:51:30,402 --> 00:51:32,042
then do whatever you can to make the most of it.

1096
00:51:33,003 --> 00:51:34,883
That said, for offline games like The Long Dark,

1097
00:51:34,943 --> 00:51:36,724
the most important storytelling tends to happen

1098
00:51:36,764 --> 00:51:38,725
outside the game, in the community itself.

1099
00:51:39,725 --> 00:51:41,125
So try to provide some in-game tools

1100
00:51:41,166 --> 00:51:43,927
to facilitate players recording their own experiences.

1101
00:51:44,927 --> 00:51:46,788
A journal-type system is a good place to start.

1102
00:51:47,848 --> 00:51:49,268
And outside the game, make sure you dedicate

1103
00:51:49,308 --> 00:51:50,869
some safe community space for the sharing

1104
00:51:50,909 --> 00:51:52,430
of fan fiction and player diaries.

1105
00:51:53,357 --> 00:51:55,741
Not only will this serve as a stage for your players' creativity,

1106
00:51:56,483 --> 00:51:58,847
but their excitement about their own stories will be infectious

1107
00:51:59,267 --> 00:52:00,930
and encourage others to explore your game.

1108
00:52:04,772 --> 00:52:06,393
Well, I don't think we've necessarily solved the problem

1109
00:52:06,413 --> 00:52:08,054
of better blending of player and authored story

1110
00:52:08,074 --> 00:52:09,715
with the long dark, at least not yet,

1111
00:52:09,775 --> 00:52:11,416
and I don't pretend that I've provided the solution

1112
00:52:11,436 --> 00:52:13,877
to this talk, the balancing act between the imposition

1113
00:52:13,897 --> 00:52:16,478
of authored story on player story is one

1114
00:52:16,518 --> 00:52:18,739
that many open world games are still struggling to solve.

1115
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:21,041
My theory is that it's not really possible

1116
00:52:21,061 --> 00:52:22,361
to find a balance between these elements

1117
00:52:22,381 --> 00:52:23,922
that satisfies all player types,

1118
00:52:24,442 --> 00:52:26,263
so that providing as much freedom as possible

1119
00:52:26,323 --> 00:52:27,944
is probably the safest path forward.

1120
00:52:28,885 --> 00:52:31,006
In this way, our solution of creating two different modes,

1121
00:52:32,011 --> 00:52:35,076
one specifically targeted at systemic anecdote creation

1122
00:52:35,196 --> 00:52:37,581
and one specifically targeted at a more traditional narrative

1123
00:52:38,142 --> 00:52:40,025
might be a viable alternative to the vast,

1124
00:52:40,526 --> 00:52:42,650
blended open-world experiences that are the purview

1125
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:44,934
of the Skyrims and Grand Theft Autos of the world.

1126
00:52:46,072 --> 00:52:48,813
Because ultimately, whether your game has discrete systems

1127
00:52:48,873 --> 00:52:50,934
designed to support player or authored story,

1128
00:52:51,515 --> 00:52:54,056
or it doesn't, the player's experience of your game

1129
00:52:54,456 --> 00:52:55,997
and how they talk about it with other people,

1130
00:52:56,378 --> 00:52:59,219
whether it's in streams, in forums, blogs,

1131
00:52:59,319 --> 00:53:01,881
or in social media, will be the most powerful story

1132
00:53:02,161 --> 00:53:02,821
they experience.

1133
00:53:06,263 --> 00:53:06,543
Thank you.

1134
00:53:15,390 --> 00:53:16,731
So we have seven minutes for questions.

1135
00:53:18,572 --> 00:53:20,353
Anyone who knows me knows that I'm a terrible rambler,

1136
00:53:20,393 --> 00:53:22,135
which is why I had to read off my slides.

1137
00:53:22,755 --> 00:53:24,336
By those, I would have run out of time a long time ago.

1138
00:53:25,717 --> 00:53:25,997
Go ahead.

1139
00:53:26,378 --> 00:53:26,498
Hi.

1140
00:53:27,298 --> 00:53:28,719
This was a really insightful talk.

1141
00:53:28,759 --> 00:53:29,300
Thank you very much.

1142
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:31,041
Thank you very much, too.

1143
00:53:32,202 --> 00:53:33,503
If it would have gone the other way around,

1144
00:53:34,243 --> 00:53:38,446
and you'd had authored story first.

1145
00:53:38,606 --> 00:53:40,047
Thanks to everyone who came, sorry.

1146
00:53:40,348 --> 00:53:42,209
For however long, a couple of years or something,

1147
00:53:43,130 --> 00:53:45,031
how do you imagine the challenges would have been different?

1148
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:48,532
So the question is, if we had done it the other way around,

1149
00:53:48,552 --> 00:53:50,633
so started with authored narrative and then done sandbox,

1150
00:53:51,774 --> 00:53:53,074
how would the challenges have been different?

1151
00:53:54,115 --> 00:53:56,417
I mean, I think that's sort of what I was trying to get at

1152
00:53:56,457 --> 00:53:59,338
with the layers idea is that I don't know that in a

1153
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:02,781
open world or sandbox game, you can't have

1154
00:54:02,841 --> 00:54:07,063
an authored narrative layer without a systems layer,

1155
00:54:07,644 --> 00:54:08,664
a world layer, et cetera, et cetera.

1156
00:54:10,149 --> 00:54:12,993
I can't off the top of my head think of an example of a game that does that.

1157
00:54:13,473 --> 00:54:13,994
Maybe you can.

1158
00:54:15,115 --> 00:54:20,602
If you say if you've gone like you can only allow the player to experience it through

1159
00:54:20,622 --> 00:54:21,363
the altered story.

1160
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:21,804
Mm hmm.

1161
00:54:22,184 --> 00:54:23,305
So we more like an adventure game.

1162
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:24,046
Yeah.

1163
00:54:24,066 --> 00:54:24,227
Right.

1164
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:26,109
And then like it would feel like a.

1165
00:54:26,649 --> 00:54:28,510
really linear story, okay, I finished the story,

1166
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:30,051
and now you start to tell the players,

1167
00:54:30,131 --> 00:54:31,471
oh, we've got this other sandbox mode.

1168
00:54:31,571 --> 00:54:33,132
Right, yeah, I think what would have happened

1169
00:54:33,172 --> 00:54:35,973
in that case is then sort of the differences

1170
00:54:36,013 --> 00:54:37,414
would be even more stark, like,

1171
00:54:37,674 --> 00:54:40,235
because you literally would have a very linear game,

1172
00:54:40,255 --> 00:54:42,336
and then this other open world game

1173
00:54:42,356 --> 00:54:43,416
kind of bolted onto the side.

1174
00:54:43,957 --> 00:54:46,218
So even though we do sort of differentiate

1175
00:54:46,258 --> 00:54:47,858
between the two things, even our story mode,

1176
00:54:48,378 --> 00:54:49,039
for a lot of players,

1177
00:54:49,859 --> 00:54:53,125
It's not actually as linear as I portrayed it here, I don't think anyways.

1178
00:54:53,305 --> 00:54:56,271
I think there's still a lot of freedom within the constraints of each episode.

1179
00:54:56,712 --> 00:54:58,795
And a good example of that is I remember when we launched,

1180
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:02,542
we had a piece of feedback in our community from a player who said,

1181
00:55:03,887 --> 00:55:05,688
You know, I find episode one so boring.

1182
00:55:06,349 --> 00:55:08,431
I spent 90 hours wandering around Milton

1183
00:55:08,531 --> 00:55:10,513
and there's just like nothing to do, right?

1184
00:55:11,754 --> 00:55:12,955
And we're like, yeah, but it was only designed

1185
00:55:12,975 --> 00:55:14,396
for you to be there for like five or six hours.

1186
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:17,879
And it just highlighted that I assume that this player

1187
00:55:17,899 --> 00:55:20,542
was someone who had come to us from the sandbox mode

1188
00:55:20,582 --> 00:55:22,904
where they would maximize their time in a space

1189
00:55:22,944 --> 00:55:25,346
and optimize their resource use as much as possible.

1190
00:55:26,107 --> 00:55:31,513
ignoring the fact that there was a whole story going on in episode one that was trying to kind of give the momentum forward.

1191
00:55:32,094 --> 00:55:35,198
So to answer your question directly, I'm not sure we would have ever done that,

1192
00:55:35,218 --> 00:55:40,565
but I think if we had, we would have ended up with two very different games, even more different than they are currently.

1193
00:55:41,366 --> 00:55:43,488
Great. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Hi.

1194
00:55:44,702 --> 00:55:46,844
Thank you so much for the talk. That was super interesting.

1195
00:55:46,864 --> 00:55:47,184
Thank you.

1196
00:55:47,204 --> 00:55:56,491
I have a question. It seemed to me one of the things you were pointing towards in player story is the importance of novelty.

1197
00:55:57,291 --> 00:56:02,155
Is the idea that you as a player can always generate new content for yourself, a new story content for yourself.

1198
00:56:02,755 --> 00:56:10,000
And I was wondering if you think that may be the key hook in making players so enamored of player story and how you think...

1199
00:56:11,719 --> 00:56:16,345
What ways do you think you can best push that into the author's story and get the same sort of novelty hook,

1200
00:56:16,726 --> 00:56:19,048
even if it's a story with which the player is somewhat more familiar?

1201
00:56:19,449 --> 00:56:22,513
That's a great question. I'm going to try to rephrase it, but you might have to help me out.

1202
00:56:28,204 --> 00:56:31,806
work with me here. So the novelty of the player's story

1203
00:56:32,527 --> 00:56:36,269
is what makes that experience interesting and you're asking how we can...

1204
00:56:36,710 --> 00:56:40,432
Yes, that's my question. It seemed like part of your argument for why it makes it

1205
00:56:40,492 --> 00:56:42,374
interesting is the novelty.

1206
00:56:42,794 --> 00:56:46,857
If that's the case, how can you best push that into the authored story?

1207
00:56:47,232 --> 00:56:49,773
Yeah, I'm not sure if I would have used the word novelty myself.

1208
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:53,255
I think of it more from the perspective of ownership.

1209
00:56:53,335 --> 00:56:55,296
So I think there's just a natural feeling,

1210
00:56:55,316 --> 00:56:57,196
and that's kind of why I tried to make the note about,

1211
00:56:57,216 --> 00:56:59,317
you know, if a story's done really well,

1212
00:56:59,377 --> 00:57:01,118
you kind of go along for the ride and you don't mind,

1213
00:57:01,638 --> 00:57:03,959
and you sort of, that's why I use words like submit.

1214
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:06,961
You submit to it because you're giving up some freedom to do that.

1215
00:57:07,621 --> 00:57:10,382
In the sandbox mode, where it's more about player story,

1216
00:57:10,422 --> 00:57:13,483
there are no constraints other than the mechanical constraints

1217
00:57:13,523 --> 00:57:15,184
of freezing to death, et cetera, et cetera.

1218
00:57:15,664 --> 00:57:21,251
So I think in those cases the players that really align themselves with that style of game

1219
00:57:21,672 --> 00:57:24,996
derive much more enjoyment out of those little moments that happen

1220
00:57:25,397 --> 00:57:27,659
kind of along the way as they're experiencing the game systems.

1221
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:31,845
So I think what we tried to do with our story mode was exactly what you're suggesting,

1222
00:57:31,885 --> 00:57:32,766
which was we tried to...

1223
00:57:33,909 --> 00:57:36,932
use the mechanics layer of the game, the system story,

1224
00:57:37,492 --> 00:57:41,095
you know, as the, I won't say filler, that's the wrong,

1225
00:57:41,255 --> 00:57:43,017
but basically the narrative or the story layer,

1226
00:57:43,037 --> 00:57:44,058
if I approach it the other way,

1227
00:57:44,118 --> 00:57:46,079
the story layer was really providing the context

1228
00:57:46,119 --> 00:57:48,061
and kind of that momentum and the heartbeat

1229
00:57:48,081 --> 00:57:49,142
of what was going on in the world,

1230
00:57:49,562 --> 00:57:51,884
and the systems layer was what was providing the moments

1231
00:57:51,944 --> 00:57:54,146
for those, you know, moment to moment experiences

1232
00:57:54,166 --> 00:57:55,927
that would hopefully be memorable for players.

1233
00:57:56,287 --> 00:57:57,448
And so that was really our intention

1234
00:57:57,468 --> 00:57:59,090
with that survival mode.

1235
00:57:59,870 --> 00:58:01,011
Sort of echoing what I said over here.

1236
00:58:02,157 --> 00:58:05,438
I think where we ran into problems was just that,

1237
00:58:06,119 --> 00:58:08,179
you know, when you have a 50 square kilometer world

1238
00:58:08,339 --> 00:58:10,200
and you can wander aimlessly forever,

1239
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:13,661
and we have players that play for 1,500, 2,000 hours

1240
00:58:13,701 --> 00:58:15,922
kind of in the sandbox world,

1241
00:58:16,442 --> 00:58:19,203
even putting them in an area that's 10 square kilometers

1242
00:58:19,223 --> 00:58:20,904
suddenly feels very restrictive to them.

1243
00:58:21,904 --> 00:58:23,344
But anyways, to your question,

1244
00:58:23,384 --> 00:58:26,005
I think we tried to do that with our story mode.

1245
00:58:26,725 --> 00:58:28,046
And I actually think that that's,

1246
00:58:28,646 --> 00:58:30,926
if you think about any open world game that's successful,

1247
00:58:30,946 --> 00:58:32,187
I think they all are doing that.

1248
00:58:32,207 --> 00:58:34,807
They're providing that overarching narrative

1249
00:58:35,167 --> 00:58:37,068
to give the player reason to continue,

1250
00:58:37,428 --> 00:58:39,188
but then really it's the moment to moment experience

1251
00:58:39,208 --> 00:58:40,608
of the game, which is what kind of brings them back.

1252
00:58:40,628 --> 00:58:42,169
And those are the things that people tend to talk about.

1253
00:58:42,189 --> 00:58:43,229
They don't tend to talk about like,

1254
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:45,610
oh my God, remember that awesome cinematic that happened

1255
00:58:45,630 --> 00:58:46,510
where that character said that thing

1256
00:58:46,530 --> 00:58:47,230
to that other character?

1257
00:58:47,630 --> 00:58:48,770
It's really more about like, holy cow,

1258
00:58:48,790 --> 00:58:50,371
do you remember that moment that that thing happened

1259
00:58:50,391 --> 00:58:52,471
in the game that I did in the game, right?

1260
00:58:53,171 --> 00:58:53,931
Does that answer your question?

1261
00:58:54,371 --> 00:58:54,572
Yeah.

1262
00:58:55,747 --> 00:58:56,408
Not really?

1263
00:58:56,928 --> 00:58:58,168
Feel free to get in touch with me afterwards.

1264
00:58:58,228 --> 00:58:59,369
It's pretty nuanced stuff.

1265
00:58:59,629 --> 00:59:00,609
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

1266
00:59:00,790 --> 00:59:01,290
But thank you, yeah.

1267
00:59:01,310 --> 00:59:01,910
Thank you for the question.

1268
00:59:01,950 --> 00:59:02,670
I'll take up everybody.

1269
00:59:02,690 --> 00:59:03,251
Okay, thank you.

1270
00:59:03,891 --> 00:59:04,311
Anyone else?

1271
00:59:06,752 --> 00:59:07,833
All right, you guys let me off easy.

1272
00:59:08,213 --> 00:59:09,333
All right, thank you very much for coming.

1273
00:59:09,553 --> 00:59:10,674
Oh, we've got one more here, I'm sorry.

1274
00:59:10,694 --> 00:59:13,315
I shouldn't have spoke too soon.

1275
00:59:13,915 --> 00:59:17,937
Hi, how similar is the story mode as it launched

1276
00:59:18,297 --> 00:59:20,498
to how you envisioned it at the time

1277
00:59:20,538 --> 00:59:21,438
of the Kickstarter pitch?

1278
00:59:26,589 --> 00:59:30,752
I mean, in terms of realization, we were able to achieve much more than what we'd expected

1279
00:59:30,792 --> 00:59:33,033
to achieve in our Kickstarter pitch.

1280
00:59:33,293 --> 00:59:40,698
We had a fairly small budget when we did that campaign, fairly modest ambitions for what

1281
00:59:40,718 --> 00:59:41,479
we would do with the game.

1282
00:59:42,219 --> 00:59:45,041
And so what we ended up delivering is, I feel...

1283
00:59:46,442 --> 00:59:47,642
at a much higher level of quality,

1284
00:59:47,662 --> 00:59:49,803
a much more impressive level of realization

1285
00:59:49,843 --> 00:59:52,384
in terms of facial animation and character realization

1286
00:59:52,424 --> 00:59:54,264
and the music and the VO and everything

1287
00:59:54,284 --> 00:59:54,885
that's going on there.

1288
00:59:55,265 --> 00:59:57,165
So certainly in our original intention,

1289
00:59:57,565 --> 00:59:59,726
things were gonna be much more modest

1290
00:59:59,986 --> 01:00:00,907
in terms of presentation.

1291
01:00:00,947 --> 01:00:03,087
So we were able to not only provide a much bigger world

1292
01:00:03,107 --> 01:00:05,728
that had a much richer set of systems to play with,

1293
01:00:05,808 --> 01:00:08,009
but also the actual narrative content itself

1294
01:00:08,089 --> 01:00:10,050
was at a higher level of realization.

1295
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:17,516
But the actual underlying story or the intention of the game pretty much didn't change at all from the Kickstarter to launch

1296
01:00:17,536 --> 01:00:20,298
with the exception of adding the Astrid story.

1297
01:00:20,318 --> 01:00:23,360
So in the original sort of idea for the Lone Dark,

1298
01:00:23,701 --> 01:00:28,425
you would just play Mackenzie's story kind of all the way through and Astrid was there as a character to kind of help

1299
01:00:28,785 --> 01:00:30,266
provide motivation for doing certain things.

1300
01:00:30,727 --> 01:00:32,889
But when we launch our third episode,

1301
01:00:33,249 --> 01:00:34,570
you're actually gonna be playing as Asterix.

1302
01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:36,552
You're gonna see the sort of the experience

1303
01:00:36,572 --> 01:00:38,214
of the long dart from a completely different perspective.

1304
01:00:38,254 --> 01:00:39,955
She's a doctor, she's in a different part

1305
01:00:39,975 --> 01:00:40,696
of the world than you are.

1306
01:00:41,096 --> 01:00:43,439
So sort of we'll show her part of the story as well

1307
01:00:43,479 --> 01:00:45,220
and kind of go back and forth between the two characters.

1308
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:46,762
So that was something that we would never have been able

1309
01:00:46,802 --> 01:00:48,123
to do in our Kickstarter,

1310
01:00:48,223 --> 01:00:50,045
like in the pitch that we had for the Kickstarter campaign

1311
01:00:50,105 --> 01:00:52,127
and would have been far outside of our reach.

1312
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:54,889
I think it's not outside of our reach right now.

1313
01:00:56,691 --> 01:00:57,393
Does that answer your question?

1314
01:00:58,134 --> 01:00:58,655
Okay, great.

1315
01:00:59,036 --> 01:01:00,359
Anyways, it seems like we're out of time,

1316
01:01:00,399 --> 01:01:01,441
so thank you so much for coming,

1317
01:01:01,561 --> 01:01:03,125
and feel free to get in touch with me afterwards

1318
01:01:03,165 --> 01:01:03,425
if you like.

1319
01:01:03,445 --> 01:01:04,207
Thank you.
