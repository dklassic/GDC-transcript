1
00:00:05,725 --> 00:00:11,168
Hello everyone, I'm Victoria and thank you for coming to my talk where I'll be basically

2
00:00:11,228 --> 00:00:16,510
talking about all the work that we've done behind the scenes to make Boyfriend Dungeon

3
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:17,211
a success.

4
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:20,192
So a little bit about me.

5
00:00:20,852 --> 00:00:22,853
I'm the community developer at Kitfox Games.

6
00:00:23,293 --> 00:00:24,333
Talk more about that later.

7
00:00:24,653 --> 00:00:26,894
Previously, I've worked on a bunch of other games.

8
00:00:26,954 --> 00:00:29,855
I've been a community consultant slash social media person

9
00:00:29,915 --> 00:00:33,096
for a bunch of games like Omensight, Leap of Fate, and more.

10
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:36,637
I have been trying every bubble tea place in San Francisco.

11
00:00:36,977 --> 00:00:38,758
It's almost disgusting, but that's okay.

12
00:00:39,558 --> 00:00:42,040
And I'm also half of a thing called Peach Butt Comics,

13
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,022
which is a game development comic

14
00:00:44,142 --> 00:00:45,644
about the culture of video games

15
00:00:45,704 --> 00:00:47,405
and making it from the game developer side.

16
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:49,207
And that's on Twitter if you're interested.

17
00:00:49,647 --> 00:00:51,729
And of course, you can also find me on Twitter,

18
00:00:52,029 --> 00:00:52,730
at the V-Tran.

19
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,152
I'm there, shenanigans everywhere.

20
00:00:56,441 --> 00:01:01,966
Yeah, so Kit Fox. So Kit Fox is a small independent Montreal indie studio.

21
00:01:02,246 --> 00:01:04,228
We're a team of eight and we've made

22
00:01:05,469 --> 00:01:07,371
quite a few games. We've been around for six years.

23
00:01:07,391 --> 00:01:12,676
Our most popular, I guess, developed game that's out so far is Moon Hunters.

24
00:01:12,736 --> 00:01:17,981
We call that our personality test RPG. That was also a Kickstarter, which I'll be also talking about later.

25
00:01:18,821 --> 00:01:33,752
You've maybe heard of Boyfriend Dungeon, which I will delve into, and we've also kind of like dipped our toes into publishing and will be publishing Six Ages, which is the spiritual successor to King of Dragon Pass and the legendary Dwarf Fortress onto Steam, which is very exciting.

26
00:01:34,413 --> 00:01:42,359
You'll see also on the photo there, so the five people there, which includes me, we're the development team behind Boyfriend Dungeon.

27
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:46,220
So it's only a team of five, so there's some things that happen there,

28
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,000
and the rest of the kit foxes are great,

29
00:01:48,461 --> 00:01:50,041
but they're not part of Boyfriend Dungeon.

30
00:01:50,361 --> 00:01:51,841
Sorry, they're also wonderful.

31
00:01:53,142 --> 00:01:56,223
But I just wanted to point out that kind of little group

32
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:59,083
because this Kickstarter was not just me.

33
00:01:59,423 --> 00:02:01,824
It was the work of many people, including consultants,

34
00:02:01,884 --> 00:02:04,085
and a lot of help, and I just wanted to make sure

35
00:02:04,385 --> 00:02:05,925
that you know that it's their work, too.

36
00:02:06,978 --> 00:02:08,679
Okay, so Boyfriend Dungeon.

37
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:11,900
If you don't know, Boyfriend Dungeon is a dating simulator,

38
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,782
dungeon crawler mashup where your weapons turn into beautiful people

39
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,823
and you take them out on dates,

40
00:02:17,903 --> 00:02:19,684
and that makes them stronger in the dungeon.

41
00:02:20,444 --> 00:02:22,946
It has male-female non-binary romance.

42
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:25,607
It was wonderful, and you're probably here

43
00:02:25,827 --> 00:02:27,628
because you heard about our Kickstarter.

44
00:02:28,468 --> 00:02:30,189
Our Kickstarter went pretty well.

45
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,851
In just over six hours, we reached our $65,000 goal.

46
00:02:35,932 --> 00:02:41,515
That was wild and I was not prepared and in the end we ended up being funded for like

47
00:02:42,475 --> 00:02:49,659
$272,000 again wild and amazing and I kind of just want to talk about all the success that we like all the success we found

48
00:02:49,699 --> 00:02:50,379
And how we did it

49
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:56,122
So the first step is actually just to have a good game like have a good idea

50
00:02:57,002 --> 00:03:00,624
Post it and then you will profit. Thank you for coming. You can all leave now

51
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,672
Obviously, this is not what happened.

52
00:03:07,372 --> 00:03:08,973
This was not an instant success.

53
00:03:09,614 --> 00:03:12,816
But the thing is, from the outside, it definitely looked like it, right?

54
00:03:13,636 --> 00:03:15,037
So this was our announcement tweet.

55
00:03:15,297 --> 00:03:19,620
Obviously, impressions doesn't necessarily mean everything, but just to give you a sense

56
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:23,182
of how big it became, we almost got a million impressions.

57
00:03:23,523 --> 00:03:25,284
When we first announced it, it got viral.

58
00:03:26,605 --> 00:03:29,648
Got 50,000 total engagements.

59
00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:31,891
And then when we announced the Kickstarter,

60
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:33,413
and this is again just a Twitter

61
00:03:33,453 --> 00:03:36,416
because this is mainly our focus in terms of community,

62
00:03:36,836 --> 00:03:38,078
it also went viral again.

63
00:03:38,678 --> 00:03:40,921
And it just basically looked like it blew up.

64
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:43,744
We had a huge following, et cetera.

65
00:03:44,485 --> 00:03:46,986
We also got news coverage from some of the biggest gaming news

66
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:49,807
sites and then some, like some general entertainment ones

67
00:03:49,847 --> 00:03:50,587
like GQ.

68
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:52,948
And basically, it felt like it blew up.

69
00:03:53,068 --> 00:03:53,909
And it was everywhere.

70
00:03:54,529 --> 00:03:56,950
Some people asked me if we paid for reviews

71
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,131
and got ad space and stuff.

72
00:03:59,231 --> 00:04:01,211
And I can assure you we didn't, because I

73
00:04:01,231 --> 00:04:04,133
get a grand total of $0 for my marketing budget.

74
00:04:04,813 --> 00:04:07,114
And it's just like something's invisible

75
00:04:07,254 --> 00:04:09,695
until it's suddenly visible, and there's nothing in between.

76
00:04:10,015 --> 00:04:11,776
And it's really hard to kind of unpack that.

77
00:04:12,516 --> 00:04:16,280
So, what I'll be talking about is all the stuff we've done to try and set it up for

78
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:16,761
success.

79
00:04:17,381 --> 00:04:21,545
And this is all the invisible behind-the-scenes work that the team put into Boyfriend Dungeon

80
00:04:21,585 --> 00:04:23,047
that people don't usually hear about.

81
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:25,389
We didn't know if it would work, to be clear.

82
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:29,093
You can know all the stats and all the best practices, but there's no guarantee.

83
00:04:29,253 --> 00:04:32,817
If someone guarantees you that it's going to go viral, don't trust them.

84
00:04:33,197 --> 00:04:34,298
I mean, or trust them.

85
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:35,259
I'm not going to run your life.

86
00:04:36,361 --> 00:04:37,922
So Kitfox has released three games

87
00:04:38,002 --> 00:04:39,403
and has announced three more.

88
00:04:39,603 --> 00:04:41,444
And what I want to talk about is what

89
00:04:41,464 --> 00:04:43,706
we found to be consistently useful in getting

90
00:04:43,806 --> 00:04:46,188
some form of attention across all our games

91
00:04:46,268 --> 00:04:47,769
of varying genres and themes.

92
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,871
So this is the agenda, with a focus

93
00:04:50,971 --> 00:04:53,573
on getting noticed first and foremost, hence the title.

94
00:04:54,113 --> 00:04:56,575
And basically making sure people hear about your game.

95
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:59,657
Maybe you'll find it useful, and maybe the stats I show you

96
00:04:59,677 --> 00:05:01,699
will help you gauge your own levels of success

97
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:02,580
and what that means.

98
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:07,060
All right, so the first thing that I find the most important

99
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,462
is basically the hook.

100
00:05:09,243 --> 00:05:10,664
It doesn't matter how good your game is

101
00:05:10,965 --> 00:05:12,587
if literally no one finds out about it,

102
00:05:12,807 --> 00:05:13,608
which is unfortunate.

103
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:16,872
There's already been a lot of great introductory resources

104
00:05:17,012 --> 00:05:19,695
on various marketing aspects, like growing social media,

105
00:05:19,835 --> 00:05:21,197
creating a press list, et cetera.

106
00:05:21,477 --> 00:05:22,338
I can't talk about that.

107
00:05:22,719 --> 00:05:23,920
Well, we're moving on from that.

108
00:05:24,821 --> 00:05:27,123
One thing that continues to be the most successful parts

109
00:05:27,163 --> 00:05:28,825
of Boyfriend Dungeon are its hooks.

110
00:05:29,305 --> 00:05:32,488
Hooks are basically things that grabs a person's attention

111
00:05:32,568 --> 00:05:33,929
into learning more about your game.

112
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,031
There can be multiple different ones.

113
00:05:36,091 --> 00:05:39,735
There's like the description, there's the art, et cetera.

114
00:05:39,815 --> 00:05:40,816
We'll be talking about that.

115
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:42,718
But the best ones are the ones that create

116
00:05:42,778 --> 00:05:46,301
an emotional level of connection to them.

117
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,276
So ideally, how long do you have to take,

118
00:05:49,556 --> 00:05:51,757
how long do you have to capture a person's attention?

119
00:05:52,617 --> 00:05:53,057
Two seconds.

120
00:05:53,538 --> 00:05:56,039
That's however long it takes to scroll past you on Twitter,

121
00:05:56,099 --> 00:05:58,780
see you on the upcoming games on Steam, et cetera.

122
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,262
And what you have to interest them in these two seconds

123
00:06:02,482 --> 00:06:05,043
is tell them you want to learn more,

124
00:06:05,423 --> 00:06:07,945
ideally give them some idea of what the game is about,

125
00:06:08,365 --> 00:06:10,106
and stand out from the hundreds of other games

126
00:06:10,146 --> 00:06:11,826
that are being released every single day.

127
00:06:12,897 --> 00:06:15,958
So I'm going to quickly break down Boyfriend Dungeons' hook

128
00:06:16,058 --> 00:06:18,358
by giving you a glimpse at how we built the Steam page.

129
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:20,019
I'm using Steam instead of Kickstarter

130
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:22,219
because I figure more of you will have that

131
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,480
than a Kickstarter page, but you know, who knows?

132
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,540
So the first one is the title.

133
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,201
Of course, this is really difficult

134
00:06:28,261 --> 00:06:31,141
and you want a title that has good SEO.

135
00:06:31,161 --> 00:06:31,942
So when you Google it,

136
00:06:32,022 --> 00:06:33,562
it doesn't autocorrect to something else

137
00:06:33,642 --> 00:06:34,682
and it doesn't sort of like,

138
00:06:34,942 --> 00:06:37,403
you don't find another more popular thing.

139
00:06:37,603 --> 00:06:39,763
Like if you named your, I don't know, your game Google,

140
00:06:40,023 --> 00:06:40,504
don't do that.

141
00:06:40,844 --> 00:06:42,284
That's a bad, that's bad SEO.

142
00:06:44,465 --> 00:06:49,848
We also have the trailer, which of course isn't playing, but this is one of the biggest pulls in terms of hooks.

143
00:06:50,608 --> 00:06:56,911
Visually, that's what a lot of games are about, and of course games do well without great visuals,

144
00:06:56,991 --> 00:07:01,253
but it is a really easy way to grab someone's attention and kind of form that emotional connection.

145
00:07:02,114 --> 00:07:04,394
We had a tagline called Romance Your Swords,

146
00:07:04,874 --> 00:07:07,035
and this is really good because you usually want

147
00:07:07,055 --> 00:07:09,595
a one sentence description that anyone can say,

148
00:07:10,015 --> 00:07:13,276
anyone who isn't in games and is in games can understand

149
00:07:13,376 --> 00:07:15,297
and kind of draws that emotional reaction.

150
00:07:16,357 --> 00:07:18,678
Shack and slash is a really bad pun,

151
00:07:18,998 --> 00:07:19,978
and I'm very proud of it,

152
00:07:20,378 --> 00:07:21,818
and it's also a pun that,

153
00:07:22,018 --> 00:07:24,179
like puns are actually great hooks because, you know,

154
00:07:24,499 --> 00:07:26,339
again, you have that like kind of guttural feeling

155
00:07:26,359 --> 00:07:28,160
of either like this is the best thing in the world

156
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,680
or this is the worst thing in the world.

157
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,401
Genre can be a really good hook.

158
00:07:32,721 --> 00:07:34,761
For us, it was dating sim dungeon crawler.

159
00:07:35,301 --> 00:07:36,322
Could be different for anyone.

160
00:07:36,802 --> 00:07:38,762
And of course, the steam capsules themselves

161
00:07:38,842 --> 00:07:40,822
are really important for when people are scrolling through.

162
00:07:41,202 --> 00:07:43,003
Again, this is just a really brief overview.

163
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,963
So one of the hardest hooks I think to nail

164
00:07:46,063 --> 00:07:47,304
is the description of your game.

165
00:07:47,984 --> 00:07:49,604
I wanna talk about it here because I find

166
00:07:49,644 --> 00:07:51,304
that's the one people most struggle with.

167
00:07:51,824 --> 00:07:54,685
So my question to you is, what game is this?

168
00:07:54,885 --> 00:07:56,765
It's a fast-paced 2D action adventure

169
00:07:56,805 --> 00:07:59,346
with challenging combat, a rich story, and gorgeous art.

170
00:08:00,006 --> 00:08:01,187
It's actually Boyfriend Dungeon.

171
00:08:01,927 --> 00:08:03,148
It might also be Hollow Knight.

172
00:08:03,968 --> 00:08:05,629
It could possibly be Dead Souls.

173
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:07,150
It might be The Messenger.

174
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:11,052
But my point is it's really easy to put a game in there.

175
00:08:11,433 --> 00:08:14,214
So my favorite thing to do when I'm creating a game hook

176
00:08:14,454 --> 00:08:18,177
description is to remove your game name and all other nouns

177
00:08:18,697 --> 00:08:19,537
from the description.

178
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,339
Replace it with a game that's a competitor or maybe

179
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:23,219
similar to yours.

180
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,281
And figure out if it's basically indistinguishable.

181
00:08:26,721 --> 00:08:28,703
If it is, then you need a better hook.

182
00:08:29,984 --> 00:08:31,665
If you need some help making something unique,

183
00:08:32,046 --> 00:08:34,728
take out everything you would usually use to describe your game

184
00:08:35,069 --> 00:08:37,551
and try to describe it again without these words.

185
00:08:38,212 --> 00:08:40,234
For example, don't use the word story-driven,

186
00:08:40,434 --> 00:08:42,316
don't use puzzle, don't use narrative,

187
00:08:42,496 --> 00:08:44,819
don't use mystery, action, Metroidvania.

188
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:46,360
Please don't use fast-paced.

189
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,342
I've seen the word fast-paced in so many...

190
00:08:49,163 --> 00:08:51,245
games and it means nothing to me now.

191
00:08:52,486 --> 00:08:55,148
But does it still sound interesting enough to play?

192
00:08:55,828 --> 00:08:58,310
So all of these descriptions that I've put on the screen,

193
00:08:59,231 --> 00:09:01,653
these are from the games themselves.

194
00:09:02,134 --> 00:09:05,156
And I just basically just removed words from them.

195
00:09:05,196 --> 00:09:06,938
And it still sounds really interesting, right?

196
00:09:07,058 --> 00:09:08,419
You would still understand the game.

197
00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:11,541
Any normal person on the street could probably repeat it

198
00:09:11,601 --> 00:09:13,043
and kind of understand what it's about.

199
00:09:14,222 --> 00:09:18,288
Essentially, your hook needs to elicit some sort of strong emotional reaction.

200
00:09:18,488 --> 00:09:19,429
This can be good or bad,

201
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,153
and it's not necessarily informative about the game.

202
00:09:22,534 --> 00:09:24,576
This is why cinematic trailers can still work,

203
00:09:25,057 --> 00:09:26,800
and even if they tell you nothing about the game,

204
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:30,004
as long as you embed a feeling in the player when they read about it,

205
00:09:30,284 --> 00:09:31,506
even before they start playing.

206
00:09:32,542 --> 00:09:35,023
And oftentimes, what the team finds most technically

207
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:37,004
interesting doesn't translate well

208
00:09:37,304 --> 00:09:39,724
to what the general public is interested in,

209
00:09:40,005 --> 00:09:41,925
though that can depend on your demographic.

210
00:09:42,465 --> 00:09:43,346
So every game is different,

211
00:09:43,466 --> 00:09:44,946
and different hooks have different values.

212
00:09:45,366 --> 00:09:48,167
So for instance, procedurally generated

213
00:09:48,607 --> 00:09:50,128
might be good in one respect,

214
00:09:50,288 --> 00:09:51,608
or maybe if you're trying to describe it

215
00:09:51,628 --> 00:09:52,728
to a more general audience,

216
00:09:52,788 --> 00:09:54,489
you can just say it's different every time.

217
00:09:55,509 --> 00:09:58,330
In a similar vein, know what not to say about your game.

218
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,810
This prevents disappointment

219
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:01,531
or narrow assumptions of your game.

220
00:10:01,931 --> 00:10:04,632
For example, we don't define Boyfriend Dungeon

221
00:10:04,712 --> 00:10:06,712
as a visual novel because that kind of feels like

222
00:10:06,753 --> 00:10:09,593
it erases the fact that there's any dungeon crawling at all.

223
00:10:10,874 --> 00:10:12,254
We use the words dating sim

224
00:10:12,274 --> 00:10:13,835
because it feels more like interactive,

225
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,835
a little bit more gameplay, that kind of thing.

226
00:10:17,196 --> 00:10:19,317
It's also important to know your key differentiators.

227
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:24,019
This is via market research done ages before you even start prototyping your game.

228
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:28,982
You have to see if your hook has already been used or if a similar hook has been already used,

229
00:10:29,342 --> 00:10:31,343
and if so, why it did or did not work.

230
00:10:31,844 --> 00:10:34,525
And remember, not all hooks apply to all games equally.

231
00:10:34,945 --> 00:10:38,147
Definitely a narrative game values things differently than a shooter.

232
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:40,728
You just have to really find yours and do the market research.

233
00:10:41,817 --> 00:10:44,000
So note that with hook strategies,

234
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,823
this doesn't describe a small aspect of your game.

235
00:10:47,283 --> 00:10:49,506
It should actually be core to your gameplay, right?

236
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,788
Like we do actually have dating simulators

237
00:10:51,948 --> 00:10:53,570
and dungeon crawler mashed up together,

238
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:54,871
and that's the entire game.

239
00:10:56,107 --> 00:11:01,132
Again though, hooks come in different forms, such as cinematics or art, and we had previously

240
00:11:01,172 --> 00:11:06,297
announced Boyfriend Dungeon, you know, in its existence way before we did the Kickstarter.

241
00:11:06,377 --> 00:11:11,982
I think we announced it existed in October 2017, and the Kickstarter was in August 2018.

242
00:11:12,943 --> 00:11:16,526
So we knew for the campaign we would need something really fresh and exciting.

243
00:11:17,067 --> 00:11:20,007
to show things off and get that explosive reaction

244
00:11:20,027 --> 00:11:21,047
that we wanted from the crowd.

245
00:11:21,407 --> 00:11:24,648
So we put a lot of work into creating

246
00:11:24,688 --> 00:11:27,709
this transformation sequence that we got from Particle Beam.

247
00:11:28,469 --> 00:11:29,829
It paid 10 times over for sure,

248
00:11:30,129 --> 00:11:32,710
and in addition to all the original music.

249
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:35,530
It's an example of knowing what your audience wants

250
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:38,971
and trying to get that emotional level from them,

251
00:11:39,051 --> 00:11:41,071
and it elevates the game's look, polish,

252
00:11:41,131 --> 00:11:42,932
and helps people literally understand

253
00:11:42,992 --> 00:11:44,352
what the game is about when we say

254
00:11:44,392 --> 00:11:45,912
your weapons transform into people.

255
00:11:49,274 --> 00:11:53,034
But this takes so long. It takes forever and that's okay.

256
00:11:53,134 --> 00:11:58,116
The best descriptions are ones that everyday people can repeat themselves and it's memorable.

257
00:11:58,516 --> 00:12:00,836
Take the time for it and make sure it works.

258
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:02,197
You know, and you can practice it.

259
00:12:02,497 --> 00:12:05,277
The best places are at conventions when you're pitching your game.

260
00:12:06,018 --> 00:12:09,558
The longer it takes for you to pitch your game, probably the shorter you need to make it.

261
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:15,003
Okay, so now that you've solidified your general impressions on the community at large,

262
00:12:15,323 --> 00:12:19,967
it still matters that you think of kind of different hooks when you're contacting press,

263
00:12:20,327 --> 00:12:21,928
whether they're content creators or journalists.

264
00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:22,949
Why?

265
00:12:23,937 --> 00:12:25,879
So I asked one of my game journalist friends

266
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:27,761
to send me a screenshot of their inbox.

267
00:12:28,341 --> 00:12:30,103
They write for a very large games outlet,

268
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:32,245
and they don't write full-time for this.

269
00:12:32,305 --> 00:12:34,487
So keep in mind this is like a part-time journalist.

270
00:12:35,148 --> 00:12:37,990
This is from their review codes folder, which specifically

271
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,952
picks out emails with certain keywords.

272
00:12:40,272 --> 00:12:42,294
So there could be more in their general inbox.

273
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:45,357
If you check the dates, they get at least two press emails

274
00:12:45,417 --> 00:12:45,717
per day.

275
00:12:46,658 --> 00:12:48,019
And here's even more of their inbox

276
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,521
with even more press emails.

277
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:50,982
And here's another.

278
00:12:51,002 --> 00:12:53,124
I got tired of blurring out information,

279
00:12:53,144 --> 00:12:54,665
so I just blurred out the entire thing here.

280
00:12:55,466 --> 00:12:57,368
But the point is, there's a lot of emails.

281
00:12:58,148 --> 00:12:59,029
And when you email press,

282
00:12:59,089 --> 00:13:00,931
you better have something newsworthy to tell them.

283
00:13:01,551 --> 00:13:04,074
We strategically made sure never to show

284
00:13:04,314 --> 00:13:06,556
or tell certain aspects about our game

285
00:13:06,656 --> 00:13:08,537
until it was time to announce it to the press.

286
00:13:09,098 --> 00:13:12,459
Again, there's a lot of resources on how to write a good email, but I want to stress

287
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:16,301
a good title may be more important than what's actually inside the body of the email.

288
00:13:16,661 --> 00:13:20,402
So in this case, the outside counts more than the inside, and I'm sorry, but that's how

289
00:13:20,442 --> 00:13:20,702
it is.

290
00:13:21,182 --> 00:13:25,144
Because after all, if they don't even click your email, it doesn't matter what's inside.

291
00:13:25,988 --> 00:13:29,089
Personalizing and figuring out what press people like will be beneficial here.

292
00:13:29,629 --> 00:13:34,011
The first email title is one that I sent to a general press member that I'm not really

293
00:13:34,051 --> 00:13:34,431
close to.

294
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:38,453
The second one is one that I talked to on Twitter and I realized they really like butts.

295
00:13:39,613 --> 00:13:39,973
It worked.

296
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:40,634
They replied.

297
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:45,891
And this changes depending on whatever news outlet

298
00:13:45,911 --> 00:13:48,391
you're talking to or the people you're talking to.

299
00:13:48,991 --> 00:13:51,292
For example, this is Dwarf Fortresses.

300
00:13:51,312 --> 00:13:54,092
I think I sent this last week almost.

301
00:13:55,173 --> 00:13:56,593
And this was an email I sent to people

302
00:13:56,613 --> 00:13:59,734
who might have not necessarily known what Dwarf Fortress was.

303
00:13:59,754 --> 00:14:01,994
And you need to know what's really

304
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:03,474
interesting about your game in order

305
00:14:03,514 --> 00:14:04,815
to properly email the press.

306
00:14:06,117 --> 00:14:08,839
And you know, Kickstarters by themselves aren't newsworthy.

307
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,901
When we emailed press about our game,

308
00:14:11,001 --> 00:14:12,903
we barely even mentioned the Kickstarter.

309
00:14:13,543 --> 00:14:15,525
The whole marketing beat was the fact

310
00:14:15,545 --> 00:14:17,927
that we had a new trailer with a cat at the forefront.

311
00:14:18,368 --> 00:14:19,228
And why the cat?

312
00:14:19,308 --> 00:14:21,590
Because the glimpse of the cat during conventions

313
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:22,751
when we showed off the trailer

314
00:14:23,152 --> 00:14:25,134
actually got the biggest emotional response.

315
00:14:25,174 --> 00:14:26,815
Like people just asked, was that a cat?

316
00:14:28,256 --> 00:14:29,998
So when we decided to email press,

317
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:32,460
we basically just put the cat in there.

318
00:14:33,021 --> 00:14:36,029
And yeah, I kept track of every single comment that we got in our trailer.

319
00:14:36,149 --> 00:14:39,177
And this is why you really want to pay attention to what people are talking about.

320
00:14:40,457 --> 00:14:43,319
So if you nailed the announcement and pressed contacts,

321
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:45,680
that's not what the entire marketing thing is about, right?

322
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,321
You have to keep people interested

323
00:14:47,381 --> 00:14:49,262
so that by the time your game actually releases

324
00:14:49,382 --> 00:14:50,903
or the mid-campaign slump comes around,

325
00:14:50,983 --> 00:14:52,003
you have something for it.

326
00:14:52,804 --> 00:14:54,304
Being a team of five on Boyfriend Dungeon

327
00:14:54,324 --> 00:14:56,165
means we often had limited resources

328
00:14:56,526 --> 00:14:57,726
or found we couldn't do everything

329
00:14:57,786 --> 00:14:59,527
that would be considered best practices.

330
00:14:59,867 --> 00:15:01,988
And my full-time job is to do the best practices.

331
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:02,949
I had no time.

332
00:15:03,709 --> 00:15:04,890
So that's where the community helps.

333
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:11,633
So we're not big forum people, so usually I'm really bad at posting on Reddit and reset error and all those things.

334
00:15:12,154 --> 00:15:17,016
Sorry if I'm a failure of a community manager there, but it's okay, because that's where the community steps in.

335
00:15:17,436 --> 00:15:21,498
Community and social media are helpful catalysts in increasing your chances of being noticed.

336
00:15:21,818 --> 00:15:25,780
A strong community approach means they'll reach more places you'll never be able to even think of,

337
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:32,423
and also if you give them opportunities to help you, you can be honest, and they will want to help.

338
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,200
But let's be clear about one thing, though.

339
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,040
Social media is not just about memes.

340
00:15:37,801 --> 00:15:40,461
Social is helpful as a compass to direct your community

341
00:15:40,601 --> 00:15:42,662
and signal what's so cool about your game

342
00:15:42,682 --> 00:15:45,702
and without them having to read entire articles about it.

343
00:15:45,802 --> 00:15:48,163
Because let's be real here, not everyone does that.

344
00:15:48,883 --> 00:15:50,243
And it's also great for word of mouth,

345
00:15:50,463 --> 00:15:52,624
which is way better than any marketing you can ever do.

346
00:15:53,004 --> 00:15:55,324
So when you find those people that are willing to help,

347
00:15:55,624 --> 00:15:58,405
make sure that you reward them and you pay attention.

348
00:15:58,485 --> 00:16:00,425
Because they will be your fans for life.

349
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:01,025
And it's great.

350
00:16:02,102 --> 00:16:05,368
OK, so let's talk about some Kickstarter optimizations

351
00:16:05,468 --> 00:16:08,133
we did to try and get more people to kind of notice us.

352
00:16:09,142 --> 00:16:10,742
So even when the Kickstarter itself launched,

353
00:16:11,022 --> 00:16:13,043
we had certain techniques to help increase the hype

354
00:16:13,103 --> 00:16:14,504
or make it more exciting to people

355
00:16:14,844 --> 00:16:16,304
who wanted to back the game.

356
00:16:16,745 --> 00:16:18,965
So one of the things that we found really good

357
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:20,926
was actually the limited time early bird

358
00:16:21,066 --> 00:16:23,407
instead of a limited number early bird.

359
00:16:24,107 --> 00:16:25,668
We made it under a 24-hour limit.

360
00:16:26,108 --> 00:16:29,149
Psychology-wise, people tend to want to back a Kickstarter

361
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:30,970
that looks like it's close to being funded

362
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:33,831
or already funded, which sucks in its own way,

363
00:16:33,911 --> 00:16:35,132
but that's how it works.

364
00:16:36,312 --> 00:16:39,034
you want to basically try to have the most hype

365
00:16:39,134 --> 00:16:41,556
near the beginning and get as much funding as possible

366
00:16:41,636 --> 00:16:44,058
because that will really incentivize people to back you.

367
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:46,099
We also had hidden stretch goals.

368
00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:48,601
This made it an exciting piece of news to look forward to

369
00:16:48,681 --> 00:16:50,742
and it meant every time we announced a new stretch goal,

370
00:16:51,323 --> 00:16:52,664
it was its own newsworthy piece.

371
00:16:53,164 --> 00:16:55,085
For a goal, fun goals actually turned out

372
00:16:55,145 --> 00:16:57,007
to be pretty good too, not necessarily

373
00:16:57,067 --> 00:16:58,868
because it motivated people to fund us,

374
00:16:58,988 --> 00:17:01,209
but it would actually spawn just nice insight jokes

375
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:03,031
and kind of like a community sense

376
00:17:03,691 --> 00:17:05,072
for those that followed the Kickstarter.

377
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,680
And of course, I'm gonna talk about a little bit

378
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,341
of stuff that didn't work out,

379
00:17:10,361 --> 00:17:11,681
because I think that's really important.

380
00:17:12,961 --> 00:17:15,902
One, we revealed stretch goal costs too early.

381
00:17:16,582 --> 00:17:19,123
When we announced our stretch goals, they were secret,

382
00:17:19,363 --> 00:17:21,044
but we announced the cost up front,

383
00:17:21,584 --> 00:17:22,724
and we should have kept that hidden

384
00:17:22,824 --> 00:17:24,345
in order to account for any changes

385
00:17:24,405 --> 00:17:26,165
that would come up later, and they did.

386
00:17:27,385 --> 00:17:30,586
And another thing that, in relation to the money thing,

387
00:17:30,726 --> 00:17:33,747
is that we tried to price in American, so USD.

388
00:17:34,247 --> 00:17:35,548
We should have priced it in Canadian.

389
00:17:37,016 --> 00:17:39,519
We thought pricing it from a USD standpoint would be better

390
00:17:39,619 --> 00:17:41,641
since most of our backers came from America.

391
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:43,623
But since we're Canadian, it actually

392
00:17:43,703 --> 00:17:46,545
ended up making our numbers look super strange.

393
00:17:47,126 --> 00:17:48,808
And due to currency fluctuations,

394
00:17:48,848 --> 00:17:50,629
sometimes our Canadian goal would be reached,

395
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:52,511
but our USD one wouldn't.

396
00:17:53,152 --> 00:17:55,514
And it made for some really confusing moments

397
00:17:55,534 --> 00:17:57,636
where backers weren't sure if they got the stretch goals

398
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:59,058
or not, but that's OK.

399
00:18:00,342 --> 00:18:02,264
We also went to PAX West during the campaign.

400
00:18:03,384 --> 00:18:07,747
We didn't actually see a huge spike from going to a convention in the middle of the campaign,

401
00:18:07,847 --> 00:18:12,830
though we did meet a bunch of passionate fans and we got more press coverage than we ever did before,

402
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:17,973
which probably helped our visibility a few days before the dates of it ending.

403
00:18:18,894 --> 00:18:21,636
But again, not too much in terms of money, so...

404
00:18:22,316 --> 00:18:22,637
Who knows?

405
00:18:23,718 --> 00:18:25,561
Add-ons, we didn't do any of those

406
00:18:25,681 --> 00:18:27,064
because we wanted this Kickstarter

407
00:18:27,084 --> 00:18:28,746
to be as straightforward as possible for us.

408
00:18:29,407 --> 00:18:31,711
I've heard of a lot of devs that, you know,

409
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:33,935
didn't make more money because they had add-ons,

410
00:18:34,055 --> 00:18:35,417
but also it was a bigger headache.

411
00:18:35,457 --> 00:18:36,940
So you pick and choose what you want.

412
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,041
And we also had no console goals.

413
00:18:39,401 --> 00:18:41,961
And I believe we would have had more money, again,

414
00:18:42,081 --> 00:18:44,322
if we did stretch goals for consoles, perhaps.

415
00:18:44,502 --> 00:18:46,402
But I don't know.

416
00:18:47,082 --> 00:18:49,163
We didn't want to make any mistakes with porting,

417
00:18:49,223 --> 00:18:50,723
and we wanted to work on the base game.

418
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:53,064
So again, kind of pick and choose what you like.

419
00:18:54,364 --> 00:18:57,525
And we also didn't have a $1 pledge tier with no reward.

420
00:18:58,085 --> 00:19:00,365
We thought that would create an anchoring effect, which

421
00:19:00,425 --> 00:19:02,026
basically means that people, when

422
00:19:02,046 --> 00:19:03,706
they see the rest of the stretch goals,

423
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:06,246
they wouldn't want to kind of back it at a higher price

424
00:19:06,287 --> 00:19:06,447
point.

425
00:19:08,078 --> 00:19:09,419
Okay, so just a quick note.

426
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,762
It isn't just about being noticed,

427
00:19:12,082 --> 00:19:13,103
as much as that is important.

428
00:19:13,323 --> 00:19:15,385
Impressions mean nothing without engagement.

429
00:19:15,725 --> 00:19:17,807
So your game needs to have some actual weight to it.

430
00:19:18,228 --> 00:19:20,050
Different games may need different value points

431
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:22,412
or gain trust and legitimacy in different ways.

432
00:19:22,832 --> 00:19:24,594
Either way, if you're a new developer on Kickstarter,

433
00:19:24,894 --> 00:19:27,197
know that emphasizing this has weight and value.

434
00:19:27,777 --> 00:19:30,479
So Boyfriend Dungeon in particular had a lot of people

435
00:19:30,619 --> 00:19:32,299
asking if it was just a gimmick.

436
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,600
And this makes sense, right?

437
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,501
It's kind of a silly game premise.

438
00:19:36,081 --> 00:19:38,242
And they wanted to know if we made this

439
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:40,523
just because we knew it would have a strong like,

440
00:19:41,044 --> 00:19:43,004
oh, like emotional reaction, we're gonna be viral,

441
00:19:43,044 --> 00:19:45,686
and then we would disappear and fade off into the distance.

442
00:19:46,026 --> 00:19:49,087
So we had to spend a lot of time increasing our trust

443
00:19:49,187 --> 00:19:50,948
and like legitimacy to the community,

444
00:19:51,368 --> 00:19:53,529
whether that was through pointing out our previous games

445
00:19:53,629 --> 00:19:55,090
or accepting any and all.

446
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:58,292
interviews about knowledge, sharing our own knowledge,

447
00:19:58,732 --> 00:20:01,734
and other games, for example, like 2D platformers,

448
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:03,155
might have the opposite problem.

449
00:20:03,676 --> 00:20:06,497
You might need to prove why your game is so unique

450
00:20:06,577 --> 00:20:08,979
and special and different from the other 2D platformers.

451
00:20:10,391 --> 00:20:12,393
All right, so how did our noticing efforts go,

452
00:20:12,553 --> 00:20:14,716
considering the Kickstarter campaign in particular?

453
00:20:15,457 --> 00:20:18,620
This is a super quick rundown of how our campaign went,

454
00:20:18,841 --> 00:20:19,862
with all things considered.

455
00:20:20,443 --> 00:20:23,326
Mid-campaign, we were averaging about $4,000 to $6,000 a day,

456
00:20:23,446 --> 00:20:25,268
which is great, since normally you think we would have

457
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:28,972
saturated our niche after the first day.

458
00:20:29,632 --> 00:20:31,594
But word of mouth kept going and we kept pushing,

459
00:20:31,614 --> 00:20:32,515
so that was wonderful.

460
00:20:33,576 --> 00:20:36,538
Here is a very large graph of our top 10 referrals.

461
00:20:37,259 --> 00:20:39,260
Or in other words, the places that converted

462
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,882
the most people into pledges.

463
00:20:41,262 --> 00:20:43,404
What I want to point out is actually our Twitter,

464
00:20:43,544 --> 00:20:45,566
which was very strange because according

465
00:20:45,686 --> 00:20:48,589
to our Kickstarter contact, the conversion rate for Twitter,

466
00:20:49,269 --> 00:20:51,171
which is the percent of pledge column,

467
00:20:51,591 --> 00:20:52,932
is usually less than 1% for video games.

468
00:20:54,413 --> 00:20:57,855
Our Twitter alone accounts for 17%, which is cool.

469
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:00,576
That's where we put a lot of our efforts into.

470
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:02,798
So it was nice that it turned out that way.

471
00:21:03,618 --> 00:21:05,079
And Warframe Dungeon in particular

472
00:21:05,199 --> 00:21:06,659
is very community oriented.

473
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,281
In comparison to our previous Kickstarter with Moon Hunters,

474
00:21:10,942 --> 00:21:13,583
it did way better in terms of social aspects.

475
00:21:13,663 --> 00:21:15,244
So here's a comparison.

476
00:21:15,464 --> 00:21:17,865
Moon Hunters Kickstarter was in 2014.

477
00:21:18,205 --> 00:21:19,966
And this was kind of before we were really

478
00:21:20,006 --> 00:21:21,026
building our community.

479
00:21:21,086 --> 00:21:22,167
So we only had like 12.5%.

480
00:21:24,028 --> 00:21:27,051
making up the grand total of referrals,

481
00:21:27,191 --> 00:21:29,193
and boyfriend dungeon is almost twice that at 23.28%,

482
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:31,696
so that was really nice.

483
00:21:33,818 --> 00:21:35,339
And the most popular times

484
00:21:35,479 --> 00:21:37,261
that people visited our Kickstarter page,

485
00:21:37,321 --> 00:21:38,763
but didn't necessarily back it,

486
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:41,505
was obviously in the beginning, which was very cool.

487
00:21:41,766 --> 00:21:43,007
A fast drop down because...

488
00:21:43,667 --> 00:21:47,668
likely a lot of people saw it, etc. It went viral during that time.

489
00:21:48,388 --> 00:21:53,529
But there's a little spike on August 23rd because we were featured on the front page of the Kickstarter website.

490
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:56,570
So that's really nice to see and of course

491
00:21:56,590 --> 00:22:00,691
there's a tiny spike near the end when people come in to check to see if your

492
00:22:01,211 --> 00:22:05,092
Kickstarter looks like it's going to be funded or not and then they decide to throw in their money.

493
00:22:05,112 --> 00:22:10,753
And they also get like a little email reminding them to back the game from Kickstarter if they are following it.

494
00:22:11,752 --> 00:22:13,453
And here's our social growth for the campaign.

495
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,035
On the right were the call to actions near the top of our page,

496
00:22:16,175 --> 00:22:19,817
and the ones with stars next to them mean they weren't directly linked on the page.

497
00:22:20,478 --> 00:22:23,780
Personally, I think having social links near the top is extremely important.

498
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,722
Chances are no one is going to read your entire page,

499
00:22:27,042 --> 00:22:29,244
even I struggle to read our entire page,

500
00:22:29,764 --> 00:22:32,106
and keep up with your updates, etc.

501
00:22:32,386 --> 00:22:35,969
So getting them on a quick and easy platform that they check often is important.

502
00:22:36,569 --> 00:22:38,710
And know which ones you can promote the most, by the way.

503
00:22:39,531 --> 00:22:41,595
I didn't put Facebook and Tumblr on there

504
00:22:41,615 --> 00:22:43,279
because I knew I didn't have the time for them.

505
00:22:44,401 --> 00:22:46,184
But Twitter, the newsletter, and Discord

506
00:22:46,204 --> 00:22:47,226
were really important to us.

507
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:49,811
So you want to know where your quality audience is.

508
00:22:50,932 --> 00:22:53,893
All right, so we have some last minute tips before I wrap up.

509
00:22:54,733 --> 00:22:56,294
Look at failure and learn from them.

510
00:22:56,774 --> 00:23:00,155
Often these are the ones that make it like ours,

511
00:23:00,515 --> 00:23:02,696
have a lot of survivorship bias, and you

512
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:03,936
can learn a lot from failure.

513
00:23:05,156 --> 00:23:07,857
We only improved parts of the boyfriend dungeon game

514
00:23:08,337 --> 00:23:10,198
that needed to be shown.

515
00:23:10,778 --> 00:23:12,799
Literally, the rest of the game was super broken.

516
00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:15,479
And it worked because everyone thought it looked really cool,

517
00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:16,800
and we were really ready.

518
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,381
And then someone thought that we could make the game in six

519
00:23:19,861 --> 00:23:20,401
and we could not.

520
00:23:20,862 --> 00:23:22,447
I'm so sorry, random Reddit person.

521
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,182
Get brutal feedback, like seriously.

522
00:23:27,363 --> 00:23:29,825
Set up an anonymous feedback form if you really have to.

523
00:23:31,306 --> 00:23:37,171
Because you can show your Kickstarter page beforehand to some other game developers maybe who have done it before,

524
00:23:37,571 --> 00:23:41,595
it's really valuable, it really puts things into perspective, but eventually it's your call.

525
00:23:41,715 --> 00:23:48,080
You know your game the best. And of course, don't forget people don't read and have very little patience.

526
00:23:48,521 --> 00:23:51,403
So again, you want that emotional reaction from everything.

527
00:23:52,204 --> 00:23:54,466
So, it's a lot of work if you're doing Kickstarter,

528
00:23:55,207 --> 00:23:57,168
good luck, but I'm sure you can do it.

529
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:59,510
Make sure to get some rest, you're gonna be okay.

530
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:00,551
That's discoverability, thank you.

531
00:24:00,571 --> 00:24:00,791
Thank you.

532
00:24:00,811 --> 00:24:01,032
Thank you.

533
00:24:01,052 --> 00:24:01,252
Thank you.

534
00:24:01,272 --> 00:24:01,452
Thank you.

535
00:24:01,472 --> 00:24:01,652
Thank you.

536
00:24:01,692 --> 00:24:02,333
Thank you.

537
00:24:02,353 --> 00:24:02,633
Thank you.

538
00:24:02,653 --> 00:24:04,895
Thank you.

539
00:24:06,176 --> 00:24:12,401
Thank you.

540
00:24:12,421 --> 00:24:12,602
Thank you.

541
00:24:12,622 --> 00:24:12,882
Thank you.

542
00:24:12,902 --> 00:24:14,343
Cool, and I think we're doing questions now,

543
00:24:15,304 --> 00:24:16,025
if people have them.

544
00:24:17,506 --> 00:24:18,847
Don't ask hard questions, please.

545
00:24:23,434 --> 00:24:24,236
Or no questions?

546
00:24:25,158 --> 00:24:25,900
Oh, yes, hi.

547
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,624
So how many followers did you have

548
00:24:27,784 --> 00:24:30,310
across your social media things before you

549
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:31,553
started the Kickstarter?

550
00:24:32,101 --> 00:24:34,783
Yeah, before the Kickstarter or before the announcement?

551
00:24:35,664 --> 00:24:36,625
Sorry, I didn't catch that.

552
00:24:37,345 --> 00:24:37,606
Both?

553
00:24:38,386 --> 00:24:39,107
Either one, okay.

554
00:24:39,807 --> 00:24:41,689
So the question was how many followers do we have

555
00:24:41,809 --> 00:24:44,011
before we announced, I guess, the Kickstarter

556
00:24:44,171 --> 00:24:45,792
or we announced Boyfriend Dungeon?

557
00:24:46,433 --> 00:24:47,734
Before we announced Boyfriend Dungeon,

558
00:24:47,794 --> 00:24:50,937
I believe we were at 7,000 Twitter followers

559
00:24:51,437 --> 00:24:57,242
and Facebook was like 2,500 maybe.

560
00:24:57,322 --> 00:24:58,663
I don't post on Facebook often.

561
00:24:58,703 --> 00:25:00,024
I don't like Facebook, sorry.

562
00:25:01,228 --> 00:25:06,072
And then during the Kickstarter we had just less than 10k followers.

563
00:25:06,112 --> 00:25:08,613
So yeah, we definitely had a sizable community.

564
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:13,476
And we also had been building up our newsletter at every convention.

565
00:25:13,777 --> 00:25:15,678
So that's really important actually.

566
00:25:16,438 --> 00:25:19,700
Newsletters are fantastic and will convert a lot of people.

567
00:25:19,821 --> 00:25:22,322
So basically at any turning point we had,

568
00:25:22,362 --> 00:25:25,184
we would recruit people to social media or newsletters.

569
00:25:25,204 --> 00:25:27,926
But yeah, I rambled.

570
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,562
Are there no more questions?

571
00:25:37,543 --> 00:25:38,144
Are we good?

572
00:25:42,811 --> 00:25:42,971
Woo!
