00:00:10,821 --> 00:00:12,802
Hello, my name is Nick Aweijian.

2
00:00:13,002 --> 00:00:14,744
I'm a game designer at That Game Company.

3
00:00:14,984 --> 00:00:17,826
And today, I'm going to talk to you all about cognitive maps

4
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:21,568
and how to prevent your players from getting lost in your levels.

5
00:00:22,409 --> 00:00:24,990
So as I said, I'm a game designer at That Game Company.

6
00:00:25,071 --> 00:00:28,053
But before I was a game designer, I was actually in architecture.

7
00:00:28,513 --> 00:00:32,475
And so a lot of the references and imagery and knowledge

8
00:00:32,495 --> 00:00:34,257
that I'll be using in this presentation

9
00:00:34,357 --> 00:00:37,339
actually come from the domains of architecture and urban planning.

10
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:42,997
One of my big interests has always been wayfinding and navigation, which is how we get here.

11
00:00:44,389 --> 00:00:48,953
So we're going to jump right in and let's first start by defining what maps are.

12
00:00:49,313 --> 00:00:55,519
So firstly, a map is a tool. A map helps you achieve something. Most of the time it's

13
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:03,227
orienting yourself in relation to other things. A map is made. So I can't go out into nature and

14
00:01:03,287 --> 00:01:08,232
find a map just sitting there on the ground. It's either made by me or by somebody else.

15
00:01:09,052 --> 00:01:11,333
It represents spaces or concepts.

16
00:01:11,413 --> 00:01:12,654
It's pretty self-explanatory.

17
00:01:13,394 --> 00:01:14,215
And it's relational.

18
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:15,895
So if I show you a piece of paper,

19
00:01:16,256 --> 00:01:19,337
and it's got a dot on it, and that dot is labeled Paris,

20
00:01:19,897 --> 00:01:21,298
that isn't a map just yet.

21
00:01:21,578 --> 00:01:24,119
However, if I show you that same piece of paper

22
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,361
with a dot that says Paris and another dot that says Cairo,

23
00:01:28,001 --> 00:01:29,402
now we're beginning to form a map,

24
00:01:29,462 --> 00:01:33,323
and those two dots can begin to anchor each other in space.

25
00:01:34,578 --> 00:01:36,219
Also, a map has edges or limits.

26
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,002
Even if it's a globe, which is a map of the entire Earth,

27
00:01:40,503 --> 00:01:42,984
you're going to be limited by how much information you can

28
00:01:43,025 --> 00:01:44,986
get at particular scales, et cetera.

29
00:01:46,187 --> 00:01:47,968
There are a couple of things maps aren't.

30
00:01:48,389 --> 00:01:50,090
Maps aren't, quote, the truth.

31
00:01:51,551 --> 00:01:53,313
They are not always orthographic.

32
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:56,875
So that kind of top-down view of something

33
00:01:56,915 --> 00:01:59,617
without any perspective that we associate with maps,

34
00:02:00,698 --> 00:02:02,220
maps don't always have to be that.

35
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,341
They're not always flat.

36
00:02:04,921 --> 00:02:09,683
That Polynesian stick chart that I'm showing on the top right is an example of a kind of

37
00:02:09,983 --> 00:02:17,066
three-dimensional, very tactile map that maps ocean swells and islands to help navigators

38
00:02:17,126 --> 00:02:19,848
navigate wide expanses of ocean, for example.

39
00:02:21,853 --> 00:02:27,496
They're also not always physical, which means they can take place in our minds, which is,

40
00:02:27,616 --> 00:02:29,596
as you guessed, what a cognitive map is.

41
00:02:30,377 --> 00:02:31,237
And it's prescriptive.

42
00:02:31,537 --> 00:02:37,780
So if I show you a map of a part of the world that you're unfamiliar with, and I label something

43
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:44,223
incorrectly, as far as you're concerned, that incorrect label is reality to you.

44
00:02:46,381 --> 00:02:49,544
So let's talk about cognitive mapping.

45
00:02:50,264 --> 00:02:53,166
This term was originally coined by Edward Tolman

46
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:54,447
in his lab in 1948.

47
00:02:55,548 --> 00:03:00,652
So if you've seen imagery of rats in a maze running around

48
00:03:00,752 --> 00:03:03,154
trying to get a piece of cheese, this is where it comes from.

49
00:03:04,555 --> 00:03:06,796
So the experiment was as follows.

50
00:03:06,856 --> 00:03:09,977
They would take a rat and place a rat in the apparatus

51
00:03:10,117 --> 00:03:12,738
that you see on the top left, this kind of circular room.

52
00:03:13,258 --> 00:03:14,699
And they would hide a piece of cheese

53
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:17,159
where that letter G is located in that yellow diamond.

54
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,300
And the rat would eventually find that piece of cheese.

55
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,081
And then once consumed, it would,

56
00:03:22,861 --> 00:03:24,942
once the cheese was consumed, they would put the rat back

57
00:03:24,982 --> 00:03:27,903
in the circle and have the rat do this over and over

58
00:03:27,943 --> 00:03:29,984
until it was almost like muscle memory.

59
00:03:30,004 --> 00:03:32,364
The rat would go in, it knew exactly what routes to take,

60
00:03:32,404 --> 00:03:33,185
and it would get the cheese.

61
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,823
Then they would take that same rat

62
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:37,845
and put it in the apparatus that you see in the middle.

63
00:03:38,346 --> 00:03:40,028
So it's that same kind of rounded room,

64
00:03:40,068 --> 00:03:42,230
but that original pathway was now blocked.

65
00:03:42,991 --> 00:03:47,697
The researchers wanted to know, would the rat,

66
00:03:48,418 --> 00:03:50,280
once it realizes that path is blocked,

67
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:57,995
have some sort of intuition as to where this piece of cheese was, and if it did, it would

68
00:03:58,015 --> 00:04:04,860
probably bias channel six, which is geographically where you would go if you just wanted to get the

69
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:09,844
cheese. But if it didn't, we would, if the rat didn't have a kind of understanding of what its

70
00:04:09,924 --> 00:04:14,507
world was in its own mind, it would just bias all of the paths equally. And

71
00:04:15,348 --> 00:04:18,191
As the researchers and Tolman found out,

72
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:21,534
rats did create some sort of mental map

73
00:04:21,574 --> 00:04:22,454
of their environment.

74
00:04:22,514 --> 00:04:24,997
As you can see on the bar on the right-hand side,

75
00:04:25,037 --> 00:04:25,817
that really tall,

76
00:04:27,503 --> 00:04:31,905
That really tall bar is how many times those rats picked Avenue 6.

77
00:04:33,005 --> 00:04:38,587
So that is what these cognitive maps are for rats.

78
00:04:38,687 --> 00:04:39,967
But of course, we're not rats.

79
00:04:40,407 --> 00:04:41,027
We are people.

80
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:43,148
We have our own people brains.

81
00:04:43,368 --> 00:04:46,729
And we inhabit non-trivial spaces.

82
00:04:46,809 --> 00:04:51,210
We live in cities, suburbs, all kinds of different environments

83
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,891
that demand us to use our own cognitive maps on a daily basis.

84
00:04:55,512 --> 00:05:00,734
So we can do a little exercise to help you understand what your own cognitive map is like.

85
00:05:01,014 --> 00:05:06,916
So take five minutes and draw your neighborhood from memory on a piece of paper. Don't look

86
00:05:06,956 --> 00:05:13,158
anything up, just try to let your mind guide your hand and just spend five minutes to do that.

87
00:05:13,258 --> 00:05:15,819
So if you want to do that exercise, go ahead and pause the video now.

88
00:05:17,136 --> 00:05:19,017
If you've done that exercise, you

89
00:05:19,037 --> 00:05:22,078
might have a drawing similar to the illustrations

90
00:05:22,118 --> 00:05:23,378
we see here on the top.

91
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,759
These illustrations actually came

92
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:27,980
from The Image of the City, which

93
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,061
is a book that urbanist Kevin Lynch published.

94
00:05:31,141 --> 00:05:33,222
And Kevin Lynch went to a bunch of cities

95
00:05:33,462 --> 00:05:35,343
and asked people to do this very same thing.

96
00:05:35,603 --> 00:05:37,023
Hey, can you draw me your neighborhoods?

97
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:41,626
And after parsing through all of those different illustrations,

98
00:05:42,047 --> 00:05:44,348
he was able to discern five elements

99
00:05:44,468 --> 00:05:47,150
that people use to make sense of the spaces around them.

100
00:05:47,731 --> 00:05:50,913
Paths, landmarks, districts, edges, and notes.

101
00:05:51,814 --> 00:05:53,875
The rest of this talk is going to explain

102
00:05:54,055 --> 00:05:55,596
each one of these elements in detail

103
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:59,359
and how we can use those to make really strong, cohesive

104
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:00,200
cognitive maps.

105
00:06:01,881 --> 00:06:04,763
But of course, this talk is also about not getting lost,

106
00:06:04,843 --> 00:06:06,524
so we need to explain what getting lost is.

107
00:06:07,227 --> 00:06:09,369
Now that we have a clear idea of a cognitive map,

108
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,952
getting lost is simply a misalignment

109
00:06:12,092 --> 00:06:15,134
of your cognitive map with what the world around you

110
00:06:15,335 --> 00:06:16,676
is with your surroundings.

111
00:06:17,196 --> 00:06:22,021
It's that feeling of feeling like an area or a space is new,

112
00:06:22,161 --> 00:06:24,222
but knowing for a fact that it isn't.

113
00:06:24,242 --> 00:06:26,164
And it's generally a bad time.

114
00:06:26,825 --> 00:06:29,467
This can result from changes in your environment

115
00:06:29,707 --> 00:06:32,390
or changes in your place within the environment.

116
00:06:33,691 --> 00:06:38,895
or it can result from insufficiently broad or insufficiently clear cognitive maps

117
00:06:39,675 --> 00:06:43,338
because you're unable to respond to those changes in an adequate way.

118
00:06:44,419 --> 00:06:46,761
Similar to this image, which is a map of the world.

119
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:50,203
It's upside down. We might be able to tell it's a map of the world,

120
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:55,407
but I'd be really hard-pressed to identify any particular country with the map upside down.

121
00:06:56,965 --> 00:06:58,827
So let's talk about the first element.

122
00:06:59,768 --> 00:07:00,669
The first are paths.

123
00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:03,591
This is also the most self-explanatory element.

124
00:07:03,771 --> 00:07:07,034
It's a linear space that directs movement and travel.

125
00:07:07,675 --> 00:07:10,017
And it also tends to be dominant in cognitive maps.

126
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:12,739
If you did the exercise earlier, one of the first things

127
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:16,262
you might have done was started diagramming all of the paths

128
00:07:16,322 --> 00:07:19,265
that you are aware in your neighborhood.

129
00:07:19,765 --> 00:07:21,787
And these are things like sidewalks, streets, trails,

130
00:07:21,847 --> 00:07:22,228
et cetera.

131
00:07:23,533 --> 00:07:27,855
travel tends to be concentrated on them and because of that we tend to treat them differently.

132
00:07:28,295 --> 00:07:34,098
You know, we pave our roads, we cut channels to make sure that water can flow through correctly,

133
00:07:34,118 --> 00:07:40,562
that sort of thing. And interestingly enough, paths are the most temporal element. So a path...

134
00:07:41,382 --> 00:07:44,969
isn't useful to you if you're not moving along it.

135
00:07:45,049 --> 00:07:48,795
And moving along a path is inherently tied to time.

136
00:07:48,815 --> 00:07:52,682
And so that process of incrementing your way

137
00:07:52,802 --> 00:07:55,126
along a path is what Lynch called scaling.

138
00:07:57,001 --> 00:08:00,244
There are a few limitations, though, when we're dealing with paths.

139
00:08:01,185 --> 00:08:03,907
We kind of digest them and use them in two ways.

140
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,969
One is dead reckoning and the other is path integration.

141
00:08:06,989 --> 00:08:10,953
And they're technically different, but for the sake of this presentation,

142
00:08:11,013 --> 00:08:13,195
we can just think about both of these concepts as

143
00:08:13,775 --> 00:08:17,458
knowledge that where I am now is where I was previously,

144
00:08:17,979 --> 00:08:22,002
plus all of the steps that I took since that last reference point.

145
00:08:23,454 --> 00:08:29,898
This relies on continuity, proprioception, or a good understanding of your own body and

146
00:08:29,938 --> 00:08:33,461
its movement throughout spaces, calculation, intuition, etc.

147
00:08:34,662 --> 00:08:43,889
However, it can be difficult or impossible to properly utilize a map using these techniques

148
00:08:44,449 --> 00:08:45,770
without knowledge of those things.

149
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,811
And a lot of times in games in particular,

150
00:08:47,831 --> 00:08:51,452
I might not be fully aware of the movement mechanics.

151
00:08:52,192 --> 00:08:56,373
I might not be fully aware of how

152
00:08:56,533 --> 00:08:59,654
the camera or the player or what have you that I'm controlling

153
00:08:59,934 --> 00:09:01,835
can experience that space.

154
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,695
And so my sense of proprioception

155
00:09:03,715 --> 00:09:04,596
there is really limited.

156
00:09:04,996 --> 00:09:07,516
So we should keep that in mind when we're using pads.

157
00:09:08,712 --> 00:09:11,913
So how can they help us prevent players from getting lost?

158
00:09:12,693 --> 00:09:15,154
Paths are really good at catching lost players.

159
00:09:16,035 --> 00:09:18,256
You can think of being lost in a desert.

160
00:09:18,436 --> 00:09:19,436
You're lost in a desert.

161
00:09:20,096 --> 00:09:22,678
You really just need to pick a direction and start walking

162
00:09:22,698 --> 00:09:23,698
because you don't know where to go.

163
00:09:24,098 --> 00:09:26,799
But once you come across a path or a street,

164
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,721
you've automatically eliminated one vector

165
00:09:30,261 --> 00:09:31,541
from your field of possibilities.

166
00:09:31,661 --> 00:09:33,702
So now you just have to choose, am I going to go left

167
00:09:33,742 --> 00:09:34,563
or am I going to go right?

168
00:09:35,123 --> 00:09:40,706
So having a path is a really good way to catch players who might be deviating away and starting

169
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:46,109
to get lost. Obviously, paths also do great level design things like establishing player flow and

170
00:09:46,149 --> 00:09:53,273
connecting large areas together, etc. Inadequate pathing in your space can make it difficult to

171
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:58,717
connect areas of the cognitive map together, and we have those limitations from dead reckoning and

172
00:09:58,777 --> 00:10:03,419
path integration that manifest themselves even more in games.

173
00:10:04,358 --> 00:10:06,739
One of the things to look out for as well with paths

174
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:08,980
is that moving one way along a path

175
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:12,161
does not necessarily mean moving the other way.

176
00:10:12,321 --> 00:10:14,222
If you've had the experience of going on a hike,

177
00:10:14,742 --> 00:10:17,403
reaching the end destination, turning around and going back,

178
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:20,784
and not being fully sure if you're going down the same trail,

179
00:10:21,505 --> 00:10:22,485
you've experienced this.

180
00:10:23,045 --> 00:10:26,347
So just because you've placed paths inside of your level

181
00:10:26,747 --> 00:10:28,107
doesn't automatically mean

182
00:10:28,247 --> 00:10:29,988
that players suddenly won't get lost.

183
00:10:30,188 --> 00:10:30,868
You need to make sure

184
00:10:30,888 --> 00:10:32,469
that you're addressing that concern as well.

185
00:10:34,025 --> 00:10:35,427
The next element are landmarks.

186
00:10:35,947 --> 00:10:39,150
Also super self-explanatory and loved by level designers

187
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:39,850
all over the place.

188
00:10:40,691 --> 00:10:43,413
They're single, localized, and memorable features.

189
00:10:43,814 --> 00:10:45,695
Paths were these linear elements.

190
00:10:45,995 --> 00:10:48,077
Now we've got point references with these landmarks.

191
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:50,359
They tend to be things you want to take pictures of.

192
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,462
And they're recognizable either visually

193
00:10:54,442 --> 00:10:56,764
excuse me, narratively or experientially.

194
00:10:56,784 --> 00:10:59,925
You know, it can be this Randy's Donuts shop

195
00:11:00,025 --> 00:11:02,126
or it could be the bench that the character

196
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:03,907
had their first kiss in, for example.

197
00:11:06,183 --> 00:11:09,145
Landmarks can be useful in a number of different ways.

198
00:11:09,746 --> 00:11:12,007
One of those is orienting players from a distance.

199
00:11:12,368 --> 00:11:14,089
A lot of the time, landmarks

200
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:18,832
are tall and so you can see them from far away, which is great.

201
00:11:19,933 --> 00:11:22,135
But they're also useful for orienting players

202
00:11:22,175 --> 00:11:24,556
when they're going down new paths and new journeys.

203
00:11:24,756 --> 00:11:27,799
So if I'm going to an area that I haven't been to before,

204
00:11:28,099 --> 00:11:31,221
but I maintain a reference point in a previous landmark

205
00:11:31,261 --> 00:11:32,302
that I've already established,

206
00:11:33,002 --> 00:11:36,345
that'll help anchor the new information that I'm receiving

207
00:11:36,645 --> 00:11:38,486
in relation to that previous landmark.

208
00:11:39,807 --> 00:11:44,150
Also, they tend to situate elements of your spaces

209
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:46,872
among themselves, which is super important.

210
00:11:47,592 --> 00:11:50,674
But also to note, landmarks are essentially only useful

211
00:11:50,714 --> 00:11:51,555
if they're stationary.

212
00:11:51,815 --> 00:11:53,656
So if you've got a large creature,

213
00:11:53,696 --> 00:11:56,338
let's say, that is walking around a big map,

214
00:11:57,479 --> 00:11:59,941
that creature is no longer that useful as a landmark

215
00:11:59,981 --> 00:12:01,362
because it's moving all the time.

216
00:12:02,202 --> 00:12:04,563
Also, they're much better when they're directional.

217
00:12:05,003 --> 00:12:07,544
So I have this Statue of Liberty here on the Eiffel Tower.

218
00:12:07,985 --> 00:12:10,245
The Eiffel Tower is radially symmetric.

219
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:12,766
So if I'm north of the Eiffel Tower looking back

220
00:12:12,827 --> 00:12:14,727
or I'm south of the Eiffel Tower looking back,

221
00:12:15,247 --> 00:12:17,228
the Eiffel Tower is basically going to look the same to me.

222
00:12:17,789 --> 00:12:21,710
But if I'm north of the Statue of Liberty and I'm south of the Statue of Liberty,

223
00:12:22,211 --> 00:12:26,293
the way that the Statue of Liberty is made makes it very easy for me to discern that,

224
00:12:26,353 --> 00:12:32,075
hey, I'm in a different spot now. So whenever you can, if, you know, making sure that

225
00:12:33,676 --> 00:12:37,918
people can use that landmark to situate themselves around it is important to you,

226
00:12:38,419 --> 00:12:40,380
try to make your landmarks directional.

227
00:12:41,502 --> 00:12:45,043
Lastly, photogrammetry is the process

228
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,484
of taking multiple pictures of an object

229
00:12:47,504 --> 00:12:49,264
and then making a 3D model from that.

230
00:12:49,684 --> 00:12:51,465
You want to think of your landmarks in a similar way.

231
00:12:51,485 --> 00:12:53,866
If a landmark is only referenced one time,

232
00:12:54,286 --> 00:12:56,927
it's not really going to be useful for the player

233
00:12:57,007 --> 00:12:58,607
to create their own cognitive map.

234
00:12:59,187 --> 00:13:00,728
You want to make sure they're able to reference it

235
00:13:00,808 --> 00:13:04,169
as many times as possible so that that reference point can

236
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:05,829
be continually reinforced.

237
00:13:07,591 --> 00:13:08,971
Next up, we have districts.

238
00:13:09,832 --> 00:13:11,572
This is also self-explanatory.

239
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:13,853
A district is a region identified

240
00:13:13,953 --> 00:13:15,614
by a characteristic or quality.

241
00:13:16,054 --> 00:13:18,434
And we have point references with landmarks,

242
00:13:18,735 --> 00:13:20,455
linear references with paths.

243
00:13:20,815 --> 00:13:23,176
And now we've got these zonal references with districts.

244
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:26,017
Here are a bunch of examples, industrial zones,

245
00:13:26,117 --> 00:13:28,038
downtowns, nature preserves, et cetera.

246
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:32,800
A good way to identify districts is to do what I call the squint test.

247
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:36,943
So if you look at your map and you squint your eyes and everything gets all blurry,

248
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:41,806
if you can start to distinguish different parts of that map, you know, like this area is a little red,

249
00:13:41,886 --> 00:13:46,769
this area is, you know, looking a little different, you can most of the time assume

250
00:13:46,849 --> 00:13:48,190
that those are your districts.

251
00:13:49,671 --> 00:13:56,893
districts have edges and you go through them so you enter into these new kinds of spaces.

252
00:13:57,413 --> 00:14:01,934
They tend to be mid to large scale and another good way of thinking about districts is a color

253
00:14:01,954 --> 00:14:08,936
by number image. So a color by number image is a kind of cohesive and consistent

254
00:14:10,677 --> 00:14:17,060
portrait as a whole, but it's comprised of these unique and recognizable colors

255
00:14:18,181 --> 00:14:21,903
that work together to make it all work out. Likewise in our cognitive maps,

256
00:14:22,023 --> 00:14:26,306
having clear districts really helps to differentiate areas from each other.

257
00:14:28,203 --> 00:14:29,444
An important thing with districts

258
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:31,405
is the concept of clustering.

259
00:14:31,826 --> 00:14:33,387
So I have two clusters here.

260
00:14:33,827 --> 00:14:35,829
I've got a set of five clusters on the left

261
00:14:35,869 --> 00:14:37,490
and a set of five clusters on the right.

262
00:14:38,231 --> 00:14:40,633
And the set of clusters that are on the left

263
00:14:40,853 --> 00:14:43,515
are way easier to remember than the ones on the right.

264
00:14:43,956 --> 00:14:47,599
And that's because they are grouped with like objects.

265
00:14:49,781 --> 00:14:52,744
This type of clustering can be semantic or mechanical,

266
00:14:52,804 --> 00:14:53,545
not just visual.

267
00:14:53,645 --> 00:14:57,630
So it doesn't just have to be three pyramids here

268
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:59,752
and three box buildings over here.

269
00:15:00,272 --> 00:15:03,756
It can be, this is an area that I can jump really high.

270
00:15:03,816 --> 00:15:06,619
This is an area where I get in cars and drive around,

271
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,120
et cetera.

272
00:15:08,651 --> 00:15:12,915
Isolating these qualities in different areas like this

273
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,838
is just generally good practice for world building and game

274
00:15:15,858 --> 00:15:16,238
design.

275
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,161
But it really helps reinforce a cognitive map

276
00:15:19,241 --> 00:15:22,544
because I could probably navigate away from this slide.

277
00:15:22,624 --> 00:15:24,286
And because they're clustered in such a way,

278
00:15:24,346 --> 00:15:25,627
the image on the left might still

279
00:15:25,647 --> 00:15:26,608
be something you remember.

280
00:15:26,728 --> 00:15:28,189
Whereas the image on the right, you

281
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:30,291
might forget the moment that I move away from it.

282
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:34,489
Second to last, we have edges.

283
00:15:35,029 --> 00:15:39,774
So an edge is a linear reference, but it's not a path.

284
00:15:40,134 --> 00:15:42,356
These tend to control continuity,

285
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:43,837
or they separate things.

286
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:48,021
Examples are gates, walls, cliffs, borderlines, et cetera.

287
00:15:48,742 --> 00:15:53,705
And they tend to be elevational simply because we tend to move around the world horizontally.

288
00:15:54,065 --> 00:15:58,307
So if we were, if we, you know, flew around a lot or climbed a lot of trees,

289
00:15:59,088 --> 00:16:04,331
edges could be barriers that are horizontal. But most of the time, they're vertical things.

290
00:16:04,911 --> 00:16:10,274
It's stuff that you tend to go around or go along or things that you go through. For example,

291
00:16:10,294 --> 00:16:15,097
being on the outside of a building, opening a door and entering inside of that building.

292
00:16:17,131 --> 00:16:19,493
You want to be deliberate when you're working with paths.

293
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:24,417
Crossing that threshold of a path or, sorry, of an edge,

294
00:16:25,698 --> 00:16:27,639
crossing that threshold of the edge

295
00:16:29,661 --> 00:16:33,905
or being blocked by the edge are really memorable experiences

296
00:16:34,165 --> 00:16:35,906
if that edge is really crisp and clean.

297
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:39,268
I notice that sometimes we have this tendency

298
00:16:39,348 --> 00:16:40,688
to want to blur things.

299
00:16:40,728 --> 00:16:43,950
Like we don't want these hard lines cutting

300
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:45,230
through our landscapes.

301
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:48,472
And this isn't to say that you need to make hard lines,

302
00:16:48,572 --> 00:16:53,674
but you should be deliberate in the limits and boundaries

303
00:16:54,034 --> 00:16:56,675
of these districts in the form of these edges.

304
00:16:56,735 --> 00:16:58,956
Because if the edges are blurred,

305
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:02,017
the cognitive map of players is also

306
00:17:02,057 --> 00:17:03,958
going to reflect that blurred nature,

307
00:17:04,018 --> 00:17:07,639
and it's not going to be as good at anchoring them when

308
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:08,999
they do start getting lost.

309
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,480
These occur a lot in games.

310
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,161
There's level transitions, level boundaries,

311
00:17:15,241 --> 00:17:18,082
mechanical boundaries, portals, ledges, walls, cliffs, et

312
00:17:18,122 --> 00:17:18,502
cetera.

313
00:17:19,522 --> 00:17:24,443
So we have plenty of opportunity to liberally use edges,

314
00:17:24,463 --> 00:17:26,744
and we want to take full advantage of those.

315
00:17:28,239 --> 00:17:30,000
And lastly, we have nodes.

316
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,261
So a node is a convergence of paths.

317
00:17:34,801 --> 00:17:38,242
It's a point reference, but it's a point reference

318
00:17:38,302 --> 00:17:41,763
that is defined by paths, which is the other element.

319
00:17:42,543 --> 00:17:44,004
Most of the time, these are things

320
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:46,825
like traffic intersections, transit hubs,

321
00:17:46,905 --> 00:17:49,666
or home spaces, or hub spaces that allow you

322
00:17:49,686 --> 00:17:51,666
to access multiple different locations

323
00:17:51,706 --> 00:17:53,187
of the game from one spot.

324
00:17:54,647 --> 00:17:57,749
If there is a place that has many ins or many outs,

325
00:17:58,269 --> 00:17:59,429
that's usually a node.

326
00:18:00,129 --> 00:18:03,151
They tend to be denser than the adjacent areas

327
00:18:03,251 --> 00:18:06,972
just because these are places that players and people flock

328
00:18:07,012 --> 00:18:09,833
to when they're navigating in general.

329
00:18:10,854 --> 00:18:11,574
So they're good to have.

330
00:18:11,594 --> 00:18:15,436
Excuse me.

331
00:18:15,456 --> 00:18:19,677
There's that expression, all roads lead to Rome.

332
00:18:20,638 --> 00:18:23,499
And in this example, Rome is a node.

333
00:18:24,341 --> 00:18:33,385
Having a location that is repeatedly used by people on their way to get somewhere is really

334
00:18:33,425 --> 00:18:38,287
important and really valuable. So when you're making a node or when you've recognized that

335
00:18:38,307 --> 00:18:42,589
you have created a node in a game that you're working on, you really want to start working

336
00:18:42,669 --> 00:18:46,631
on placemaking there in order to make it as recognizable as possible.

337
00:18:47,411 --> 00:18:51,895
These nodes can be destinations. They don't just have to be things that you go in or go through.

338
00:18:51,915 --> 00:18:57,560
And a good way to facilitate that is just make sure that people can spend some time there as

339
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:02,504
opposed to just, you know, be transient and move through something. I've been on plenty

340
00:19:02,925 --> 00:19:06,588
highway intersections having grown up my whole life in LA.

341
00:19:07,549 --> 00:19:10,734
But if you were to drop me in one of these big highway interchanges,

342
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:15,320
I might be hard-pressed to know where I am without all the signage.

343
00:19:15,661 --> 00:19:17,604
So if you're going to make a node,

344
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:23,172
try to turn it into a place and not just some arbitrary thing you pass through.

345
00:19:24,177 --> 00:19:27,197
So those are the five elements, what they are,

346
00:19:27,257 --> 00:19:29,598
how you can identify them, how you can leverage them,

347
00:19:29,638 --> 00:19:30,518
and why they're useful.

348
00:19:31,558 --> 00:19:34,659
But now let's talk about more specifically implementing them

349
00:19:34,939 --> 00:19:36,119
in our design practice.

350
00:19:36,619 --> 00:19:39,280
So the first thing I like to do is do an audit,

351
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,221
try to look at levels and spaces that I've already made

352
00:19:42,261 --> 00:19:45,721
and identify existing paths, landmarks, districts, edges,

353
00:19:45,921 --> 00:19:47,862
and nodes in those areas.

354
00:19:48,462 --> 00:19:50,962
Then once I've done that, I want to assess the clarity

355
00:19:51,062 --> 00:19:52,323
and readability of those things.

356
00:19:52,843 --> 00:19:55,345
If I'm kind of doing this audit and then I'm saying,

357
00:19:56,026 --> 00:19:58,888
that could be a landmark or that looks like a good enough

358
00:19:58,968 --> 00:20:02,171
district, et cetera, it probably isn't a good enough landmark

359
00:20:02,211 --> 00:20:03,672
and it probably isn't a district.

360
00:20:03,752 --> 00:20:09,096
So that's a key for me to go back and clarify those things.

361
00:20:10,017 --> 00:20:14,461
Really, really not be shy about these design decisions

362
00:20:14,501 --> 00:20:15,021
that I'm making.

363
00:20:16,987 --> 00:20:19,951
Then I want to organize my space.

364
00:20:20,151 --> 00:20:22,915
So I tend to work, because of the architectural background,

365
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:24,877
I like to work in plan first,

366
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,821
and I like to think of plan as the organization

367
00:20:27,942 --> 00:20:29,484
or structure for everything.

368
00:20:30,805 --> 00:20:33,047
I think the plan should be clear and legible.

369
00:20:33,388 --> 00:20:36,290
And by looking at that plan, you should

370
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:39,233
be able to easily recognize almost all of these elements

371
00:20:39,293 --> 00:20:39,493
there.

372
00:20:40,154 --> 00:20:43,997
Once the plan really pops with all of these elements

373
00:20:44,017 --> 00:20:47,160
and the really distinct, then I like to move on to section.

374
00:20:47,781 --> 00:20:50,003
And section is where I think the emotion comes out,

375
00:20:50,043 --> 00:20:52,585
where the storytelling happens, where the experience really

376
00:20:52,645 --> 00:20:53,226
takes place.

377
00:20:53,985 --> 00:20:56,848
Just because I've got one of these elements in my plan,

378
00:20:56,908 --> 00:20:58,289
it doesn't mean it's actually going

379
00:20:58,309 --> 00:20:59,850
to come through in my section when

380
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:00,951
I'm experiencing the game.

381
00:21:01,611 --> 00:21:04,433
So if I see on my plan there's this really strong landmark,

382
00:21:04,653 --> 00:21:06,074
but then when I start playing the game,

383
00:21:06,215 --> 00:21:07,616
that landmark isn't really reading,

384
00:21:08,056 --> 00:21:10,958
that's a key to me to go back and edit that landmark

385
00:21:10,998 --> 00:21:14,161
to make sure that it's legible when I'm playing the game.

386
00:21:15,422 --> 00:21:17,063
Speaking of playing the game, it's

387
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:20,065
super important to test, if you can,

388
00:21:20,505 --> 00:21:23,548
without a HUD or a mini-map or UI, et cetera.

389
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:25,325
Why is this?

390
00:21:25,947 --> 00:21:26,831
A couple of things.

391
00:21:28,514 --> 00:21:32,597
Using tools like a radar, GPS, or a mini-map

392
00:21:33,397 --> 00:21:36,439
can lead us into digesting spaces

393
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,781
using an egocentric frame of reference,

394
00:21:38,961 --> 00:21:41,103
as opposed to an allocentric frame of reference.

395
00:21:41,663 --> 00:21:42,584
So what do these mean?

396
00:21:43,264 --> 00:21:44,885
Egocentric frame of reference means

397
00:21:45,046 --> 00:21:47,507
I am the center of the universe, and the universe kind of

398
00:21:47,567 --> 00:21:49,489
revolves around me as I go through it.

399
00:21:50,029 --> 00:21:53,432
If you've used a GPS navigation system on your phone,

400
00:21:54,292 --> 00:21:55,253
that's egocentric.

401
00:21:56,714 --> 00:22:02,696
This can be difficult because you're navigating in this piecemeal fashion where you're primarily

402
00:22:02,756 --> 00:22:07,618
focused on what your next maneuver is going to be. You know, I need to turn right and 500 feet

403
00:22:07,698 --> 00:22:15,701
and turn left, etc. And breaking down the journey in that way has been shown to result in a decrease

404
00:22:15,841 --> 00:22:16,461
in route memory.

405
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:19,203
It can also disengage you from the environment

406
00:22:19,703 --> 00:22:24,045
because you're exploring the map or the UI or the HUD

407
00:22:24,226 --> 00:22:25,766
instead of the space itself.

408
00:22:26,207 --> 00:22:29,208
What you're trying to do is actually take that triangle

409
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,749
and move it to that circle.

410
00:22:31,369 --> 00:22:33,110
And your character moving through the world

411
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:34,651
is just a byproduct of you trying

412
00:22:34,671 --> 00:22:36,452
to get those shapes to align.

413
00:22:37,632 --> 00:22:41,673
However, if you test without the aid of a heads-up display,

414
00:22:42,074 --> 00:22:47,196
et cetera, you tend to do more allocentric mapping.

415
00:22:47,776 --> 00:22:50,297
Allocentric mapping is, I am not the center of the world.

416
00:22:50,817 --> 00:22:53,358
The world exists, and I am simply moving through it.

417
00:22:53,518 --> 00:22:55,339
It's this kind of big picture navigation.

418
00:22:55,899 --> 00:22:57,940
And when you do things this way, there

419
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,801
tends to be an increase in route memory.

420
00:23:00,521 --> 00:23:02,502
You're engaged more with your environment,

421
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:05,684
and you're exploring the space instead of just exploring

422
00:23:05,704 --> 00:23:06,344
the map itself.

423
00:23:06,784 --> 00:23:10,848
I have this image here of the fish in the lake and the bird in the trees.

424
00:23:11,388 --> 00:23:14,571
So the fish in the lake can see the bird in the trees,

425
00:23:15,472 --> 00:23:17,914
and it can see the trees, but it can't see the lake because that's

426
00:23:18,534 --> 00:23:22,778
that's where it is. Likewise, the bird can identify the fish and the lake, but not

427
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:26,581
the forest, because it's understanding things

428
00:23:26,641 --> 00:23:27,322
egocentrically.

429
00:23:27,922 --> 00:23:30,264
What we want to do to get a clear picture of everything

430
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:33,066
is try to get what the image in the center is,

431
00:23:33,126 --> 00:23:35,967
which is essentially an allocentric frame of reference,

432
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:39,209
which is this is the environment,

433
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:42,051
and the player is simply moving through the environment.

434
00:23:43,592 --> 00:23:43,712
So.

435
00:23:44,828 --> 00:23:49,030
The TLDR of this talk is, one, there exist

436
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,710
things called cognitive maps.

437
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:54,792
It is the digestion of the environments

438
00:23:54,812 --> 00:23:57,853
that you go through that exist in everybody's head.

439
00:23:58,954 --> 00:24:01,235
Getting lost is when that cognitive map

440
00:24:01,515 --> 00:24:05,977
is misaligned with what the environment is currently

441
00:24:05,997 --> 00:24:06,257
telling you.

442
00:24:08,757 --> 00:24:11,537
So how can we prevent players from getting lost?

443
00:24:12,018 --> 00:24:14,798
Well, we can try to foster clearer cognitive maps.

444
00:24:15,399 --> 00:24:16,359
And how can we do that?

445
00:24:16,979 --> 00:24:21,221
We can use a toolkit using paths, landmarks, districts,

446
00:24:21,441 --> 00:24:24,842
edges, and nodes to make sure that our spaces are robust

447
00:24:24,982 --> 00:24:28,043
and can actually foster these robust cognitive maps.

448
00:24:28,463 --> 00:24:30,363
And a good way to do that is just be deliberate.

449
00:24:30,784 --> 00:24:34,925
I've included this lovely food tray here

450
00:24:35,485 --> 00:24:35,785
because

451
00:24:37,246 --> 00:24:46,449
I could take the same food tray with all of those same ingredients and just kind of like mix it all up in there and everything's, you know, all up on top of each other and blended.

452
00:24:47,829 --> 00:24:50,870
But it wouldn't be as appetizing, first of all.

453
00:24:51,838 --> 00:24:55,079
And secondly, it wouldn't be as memorable to me.

454
00:24:56,239 --> 00:24:56,620
Excuse me.

455
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,420
It would have the same nutritional value,

456
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:01,161
but by virtue of the way it's organized,

457
00:25:01,401 --> 00:25:02,841
it's not going to read as clearly.

458
00:25:03,161 --> 00:25:05,182
And with this one, I can do my squint tests,

459
00:25:05,862 --> 00:25:08,122
and I can begin to start making out districts.

460
00:25:08,202 --> 00:25:11,143
I can kind of start to make out landmarks, even with this food.

461
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:14,484
So you can really apply these design strategies

462
00:25:14,524 --> 00:25:15,404
to nearly everything.

463
00:25:17,168 --> 00:25:25,837
Lastly, I wanted to just show you all of these different references that I have used to try

464
00:25:25,898 --> 00:25:27,800
to understand these things for myself.

465
00:25:28,681 --> 00:25:33,246
These are all people who are way more intelligent than I am, and if you're interested in pursuing

466
00:25:33,266 --> 00:25:35,548
this topic further, I would encourage you to go here.

467
00:25:37,617 --> 00:25:41,800
Here are a bunch of more names that you should continue to take a look at.

468
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,281
Go ahead and pause the video,

469
00:25:44,021 --> 00:25:48,264
and any one of these is going to be an exciting paper for you to enjoy.

470
00:25:48,284 --> 00:25:49,405
I'll go back.

471
00:25:51,627 --> 00:25:52,327
Thank you very much.

472
00:25:52,887 --> 00:25:55,968
I hope that this helped enlighten you

473
00:25:56,189 --> 00:25:59,950
and helped you understand how to prevent your players

474
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:02,511
from getting lost and introduced a new paradigm

475
00:26:03,192 --> 00:26:05,853
for understanding how you can design your levels specifically

476
00:26:05,913 --> 00:26:06,693
for that use case.

477
00:26:07,494 --> 00:26:08,654
My name is Nick Aweijian.

478
00:26:08,674 --> 00:26:10,195
I hope you have a great day.

479
00:26:10,875 --> 00:26:12,396
And that's it.

480
00:26:12,656 --> 00:26:13,576
Thank you so much.

481
00:26:14,116 --> 00:26:14,817
All right, bye.
