00:00:11,532 --> 00:00:12,253
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:13,494 --> 00:00:16,136
Welcome to the Free to Play Summit at GDC.

3
00:00:16,996 --> 00:00:18,257
My name is Abigail Rindo.

4
00:00:19,038 --> 00:00:22,200
I head up the narrative efforts at King's Stockholm studio,

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,403
and I'm here to talk to you today about narrative breadcrumbs.

6
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:32,991
and how they can help you guide the player journey through story-driven events.

7
00:00:39,967 --> 00:00:43,030
So I've been working in games for about eight years now.

8
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:49,275
I've worked on 20 different serious and mobile game titles in a variety of roles.

9
00:00:50,636 --> 00:00:56,340
And about a year and a half ago, I had a wonderful opportunity to come to

10
00:00:56,961 --> 00:01:01,304
Sweden and help the Stockholm studio at King with narrative design.

11
00:01:02,448 --> 00:01:08,753
I was so excited to embark on an epic new journey, where I thought I would work on fantastic

12
00:01:08,813 --> 00:01:15,739
titles like Candy Crush, meet amazing new people, and explore astonishing new places

13
00:01:15,899 --> 00:01:17,601
and locations within Europe.

14
00:01:20,063 --> 00:01:25,968
Well, I did get to work on Candy Crush, and I did meet some amazing people, but I think

15
00:01:26,008 --> 00:01:27,889
we all know what happened next.

16
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:40,244
After about three months into my role, the COVID-19 pandemic hit, and like many of us, I found myself with an overabundance of time at home.

17
00:01:42,545 --> 00:01:47,986
And also, like many of us, I decided to spend some of that time learning to bake.

18
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:57,568
Now, I've always loved cooking, but baking has been something I've been traditionally pretty bad at.

19
00:01:59,595 --> 00:02:11,100
But after a lot of practice, a bunch of YouTube videos, and big failures, small successes,

20
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,201
I did start to get the hang of it.

21
00:02:15,622 --> 00:02:21,965
And as I'm baking, I'm working from home like so many of us, and I'm trying to also think

22
00:02:22,025 --> 00:02:24,146
about narrative and Candy Crush.

23
00:02:25,565 --> 00:02:31,696
I've always thought about live games as a journey rather than a story with an ending,

24
00:02:32,037 --> 00:02:36,184
and I was trying to figure out what that Candy Crush journey might be.

25
00:02:39,456 --> 00:02:43,019
Our narrative team had already done some pretty amazing work on this.

26
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:49,464
They had created a revised lore and story bible that told the secret history of the

27
00:02:49,504 --> 00:02:50,305
Candy Kingdom.

28
00:02:51,106 --> 00:02:56,130
There was also an amazing character bible that was filled with detailed casting notes,

29
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:59,453
character relationships, and lots and lots of backstory.

30
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:07,539
All this was created to support a brand that was immensely popular with a really successful

31
00:03:07,579 --> 00:03:08,500
and long legacy.

32
00:03:09,871 --> 00:03:15,392
Our new challenge and opportunity was to figure out how to make all of this player-facing.

33
00:03:17,093 --> 00:03:24,114
So I'm baking and I'm thinking about journeys while writing about a sweet and whimsical fairy

34
00:03:24,154 --> 00:03:32,756
tale world filled with candy. And I realized that with our events and features we're leaving

35
00:03:32,836 --> 00:03:36,457
our players a trail of breadcrumbs throughout the map.

36
00:03:38,462 --> 00:03:42,344
Each moment of this bite-sized narrative builds that player journey,

37
00:03:42,664 --> 00:03:45,746
and our journey in Candy Crush has been a long one.

38
00:03:46,747 --> 00:03:52,210
I realized that I needed to get a full understanding of what that experience had been so far.

39
00:03:53,771 --> 00:03:55,572
So I asked myself,

40
00:03:56,273 --> 00:04:01,756
what is the trail of breadcrumbs that we've created for our players within Candy Crush?

41
00:04:04,538 --> 00:04:05,298
I began digging.

42
00:04:06,632 --> 00:04:11,873
I played the game, I talked to players, did some research, and talked with the team.

43
00:04:11,894 --> 00:04:17,575
And on first glance, Candy Crush is a whimsical and sweet world.

44
00:04:18,855 --> 00:04:21,976
It's filled with papercraft imagery and quirky characters.

45
00:04:23,956 --> 00:04:29,998
It's a world of escape, where players can forget their daily troubles and have a meditative

46
00:04:30,078 --> 00:04:31,678
moment of sweetness in their day.

47
00:04:34,082 --> 00:04:39,690
But as I looked deeper at what we had been offering our players on a day-to-day basis,

48
00:04:40,091 --> 00:04:41,873
that world became less clear.

49
00:04:43,276 --> 00:04:47,963
The events we were offering would vary pretty widely from day-to-day.

50
00:04:49,937 --> 00:04:52,797
If you followed a typical player experience in a week,

51
00:04:53,617 --> 00:04:57,758
it became apparent that we were throwing a lot of narrative information

52
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:00,178
at our players through these events and features.

53
00:05:01,018 --> 00:05:05,439
But we weren't necessarily doing it in a strategic or coherent way.

54
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,200
I discovered that we weren't getting the benefits that narrative can bring.

55
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,381
Players were so confused by the messages that we were sending them

56
00:05:15,801 --> 00:05:18,802
that they just decided to ignore the content entirely.

57
00:05:20,132 --> 00:05:22,453
They decided that the story didn't matter.

58
00:05:24,934 --> 00:05:31,556
They didn't know where they were because they didn't know where they had come from.

59
00:05:36,398 --> 00:05:40,880
Now this isn't necessarily an unusual problem in our industry, let's be honest.

60
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,321
At so many casual gaming companies, there's this misunderstanding

61
00:05:45,722 --> 00:05:49,023
between narrative design and just putting text up on a screen.

62
00:05:51,118 --> 00:05:55,842
Often as narrative designers, we're given a game or feature at the very last minute

63
00:05:55,922 --> 00:06:00,367
and expected to fill in the blanks with flavorful and brilliant copy.

64
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:08,294
But as much as I love writing, this method of adding narrative treats it as salt to add

65
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:13,819
flavor at the end, rather than the core elements that actually hold the brand together and

66
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:14,440
strengthen it.

67
00:06:15,284 --> 00:06:18,567
It's a missed opportunity in many casual games,

68
00:06:18,967 --> 00:06:22,390
and Candy Crush Saga and Candy Crush Soda were no different.

69
00:06:24,031 --> 00:06:26,153
Unfortunately, the environments and characters

70
00:06:26,514 --> 00:06:29,356
had become relegated to decorations

71
00:06:29,676 --> 00:06:31,878
that were entirely disconnected from gameplay.

72
00:06:32,799 --> 00:06:34,921
This resulted in our worlds becoming

73
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:36,282
arbitrary for the player.

74
00:06:37,723 --> 00:06:40,385
Unfortunately, our characters had

75
00:06:40,425 --> 00:06:42,447
become interchangeable and generic.

76
00:06:43,499 --> 00:06:45,581
Players didn't know the difference between them.

77
00:06:46,162 --> 00:06:49,245
They were pattern matching our characters to features,

78
00:06:49,805 --> 00:06:52,347
rather than thinking of them as, you know,

79
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:55,630
people that they could help or friends on their journey.

80
00:06:57,152 --> 00:06:59,975
And because of this, the perceived failure of the brand suffered.

81
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:06,704
Even players that had spent years with the product couldn't differentiate between our

82
00:07:06,744 --> 00:07:12,589
main characters, and very few were able to tell us anything about them beyond the feature

83
00:07:12,989 --> 00:07:15,031
that they may have been attached to.

84
00:07:16,752 --> 00:07:23,698
Some people on the team saw this as a non-starter, or even a non-issue, but I saw this as an

85
00:07:23,758 --> 00:07:24,438
opportunity.

86
00:07:25,764 --> 00:07:37,750
After all, I'd come to King after working on a game called Disney Heroes, which had some of the most memorable and amazing characters and brands that we have in the world today.

87
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:49,416
I knew the strength of characters, I know the strength of characters, and I also know that our story world has tremendous potential.

88
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:55,541
But I not only had to convince our teams of that potential,

89
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:58,723
but just the potential of narrative and characters as well.

90
00:08:00,103 --> 00:08:02,845
And that wasn't necessarily an easy thing to do.

91
00:08:04,505 --> 00:08:07,507
After all, King has had tremendous success

92
00:08:07,607 --> 00:08:09,208
with this product for nine years.

93
00:08:10,108 --> 00:08:12,109
Candy Crush is a deeply beloved game

94
00:08:12,209 --> 00:08:15,190
played by millions of people all over the world.

95
00:08:16,171 --> 00:08:17,391
It's genre defining.

96
00:08:20,313 --> 00:08:20,593
And it's a

97
00:08:23,143 --> 00:08:24,303
And it's a privilege to work on.

98
00:08:26,044 --> 00:08:29,506
But teams were skeptical that narrative could add value to the game.

99
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:37,891
I had to be convincing, but I also wanted to make sure and honor what had come before,

100
00:08:38,972 --> 00:08:44,275
while paving the way towards a future that would allow our players to have a deeper enjoyment

101
00:08:44,295 --> 00:08:45,876
of the game for nine more years.

102
00:08:47,918 --> 00:08:49,298
So I set out on my own journey.

103
00:08:50,213 --> 00:08:56,456
to find and evangelize the recipe for a narrative-driven event strategy for Candy Cressoda and Candy

104
00:08:56,496 --> 00:08:57,057
Cressada.

105
00:08:58,898 --> 00:09:03,860
Now, like baking, both of these games seem simple on the surface, but they're difficult

106
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,420
to master.

107
00:09:05,501 --> 00:09:10,983
Anyone that has played these games will recognize the sweet simplicity and appeal of Match 3.

108
00:09:12,742 --> 00:09:19,565
I had to take the core elements of that simplicity and use those elements to build sophisticated

109
00:09:19,686 --> 00:09:20,886
and coherent stories.

110
00:09:21,967 --> 00:09:29,291
To do this, I needed to create and hone a technique through dedicated practice and experimentation.

111
00:09:31,152 --> 00:09:35,535
Just like my adventures with baking, there were successes and failures, but each attempt

112
00:09:35,615 --> 00:09:37,796
got us closer to delicious results.

113
00:09:41,158 --> 00:09:42,098
Through this practice...

114
00:09:43,727 --> 00:09:51,193
I discovered that there are simple core ingredients for adding story to live events, and that

115
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:56,217
when you combine that with masterful technique honed over time, something magical happens.

116
00:09:58,659 --> 00:10:02,623
So Abigail, what is this magical narrative breadcrumb recipe?

117
00:10:03,563 --> 00:10:10,709
Well, just like Candy Crush, our recipe begins with combining three sweet core ingredients,

118
00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:12,911
or as I like to call them, the three Cs.

119
00:10:14,285 --> 00:10:18,966
Context, characters, and conflict.

120
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:22,426
Each game and event is different.

121
00:10:22,887 --> 00:10:26,047
So the amount of these ingredients is going to vary.

122
00:10:26,207 --> 00:10:27,107
It should vary.

123
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,528
You'll need to experiment

124
00:10:30,268 --> 00:10:33,369
and discover what blend works best for you.

125
00:10:33,389 --> 00:10:38,030
But once you have the right blend of those ingredients,

126
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,611
you can start to blend them in

127
00:10:41,691 --> 00:10:43,111
with your gameplay mechanics.

128
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:51,275
an event structure to seamlessly build the strength of the event and hold all of those pieces together.

129
00:10:52,496 --> 00:10:58,599
Like kneading bread dough to build strength in that dough.

130
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,162
You need to seamlessly blend your story elements into your gameplay

131
00:11:04,663 --> 00:11:10,046
and strengthen those events to create deep and meaningful impact.

132
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:17,872
So far, we've seen some pretty good success with this model.

133
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:21,153
With the right blend of ingredients and technique,

134
00:11:21,493 --> 00:11:25,334
we've seen increases in both player engagement and spend with this strategy.

135
00:11:26,695 --> 00:11:30,336
Now, I can't share specific stats with you today,

136
00:11:31,276 --> 00:11:35,178
but what I can do is give you a trail of breadcrumbs to follow,

137
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:38,139
so you can find the right balance for your games.

138
00:11:41,113 --> 00:11:43,175
Our journey begins with Candy Crush Soda.

139
00:11:44,536 --> 00:11:49,661
Last year, we were presented with a unique narrative problem.

140
00:11:50,782 --> 00:11:56,707
The art team was changing the art style from a flat 2D paper cut to 3D.

141
00:11:58,368 --> 00:12:03,693
While we could have just flipped a switch to make this change, we decided to ground

142
00:12:03,733 --> 00:12:05,815
it within a deeper narrative context.

143
00:12:07,499 --> 00:12:13,063
To do this, we used live events spanning multiple months.

144
00:12:13,123 --> 00:12:17,187
First, we built anticipation around the event

145
00:12:17,587 --> 00:12:22,151
by having a mysterious soda storm hit the Candy Kingdom.

146
00:12:23,672 --> 00:12:28,055
By bringing the soda of Candy Crush to Candy Crush Soda

147
00:12:29,056 --> 00:12:32,338
into the game world, we were able to contextualize

148
00:12:32,358 --> 00:12:34,860
the moment-to-moment fluid dynamics of the puzzles

149
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,882
that the players had been playing for many years.

150
00:12:39,068 --> 00:12:46,111
Soon, this storm flooded everything in the 2D world, causing chaos and a massive soda flood.

151
00:12:47,431 --> 00:12:52,013
Our characters were suddenly presented with a difficult choice.

152
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:57,035
Do they give up or do they rebuild?

153
00:13:00,597 --> 00:13:04,839
Rather than give up, our characters decided to work together to save Candy Town.

154
00:13:05,539 --> 00:13:08,320
We challenged players to help the characters rebuild.

155
00:13:09,309 --> 00:13:13,371
which allowed them to take part in revealing this new beautiful art style.

156
00:13:14,872 --> 00:13:19,614
The series of events not only helped transition players into the new art style,

157
00:13:19,935 --> 00:13:24,517
but it built hype around the game and the event as players speculated about what

158
00:13:24,557 --> 00:13:25,918
was actually happening in Soda.

159
00:13:27,338 --> 00:13:30,960
And as the players built the new scene, they were able to feel,

160
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:35,843
they were able to feel like they had a hand in restoring and revealing this

161
00:13:35,883 --> 00:13:37,924
beautiful new artwork. They felt invested.

162
00:13:42,245 --> 00:13:45,966
Once that town was rebuilt and the new style was unveiled,

163
00:13:46,466 --> 00:13:50,687
the players were then able to free the old 2D characters

164
00:13:51,107 --> 00:13:53,148
from their former paper backings,

165
00:13:53,848 --> 00:13:57,749
and they saw the brand new 3D ones emerge.

166
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:01,010
All of a sudden, something that was a flat decoration

167
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:04,471
in the game became characters that were filled

168
00:14:04,491 --> 00:14:07,212
with personality, that were alive and vibrant.

169
00:14:07,992 --> 00:14:09,913
The personalities started to come through in these

170
00:14:10,929 --> 00:14:14,370
Fantastic animations by our animator. She's just so talented.

171
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:21,231
And then the players became more deeply connected to those characters.

172
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:28,833
They gave us great feedback saying that this event allowed them to feel hopeful and connected

173
00:14:28,873 --> 00:14:35,594
during the pandemic. As they investigated the mystery of the Soda Flood and helped the

174
00:14:35,634 --> 00:14:40,055
characters rebuild, they were able to deeply connect with them.

175
00:14:40,829 --> 00:14:44,612
in a way that felt related to their own situations.

176
00:14:46,534 --> 00:14:50,878
Players wrote really moving poetry, and they recorded video

177
00:14:51,238 --> 00:14:54,761
and drew pictures about the experience that they had.

178
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:02,228
Our journey continues with Candy Crush Saga,

179
00:15:02,609 --> 00:15:06,332
where one of the first areas of opportunity we explored was the Saga map.

180
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:12,192
So we wanted to contextualize the players' movement throughout the world,

181
00:15:12,873 --> 00:15:18,075
and we also wanted to introduce them and reinforce two of our most popular rewards,

182
00:15:18,195 --> 00:15:20,216
the lollipop hammer and the color bomb.

183
00:15:21,516 --> 00:15:26,158
We then raised the stakes by introducing a heist plot to the event.

184
00:15:27,098 --> 00:15:32,741
Bubblegum Troll uses the bubblegum pop blockers to blow up Mr. Toffee's vault,

185
00:15:34,241 --> 00:15:36,802
and then he steals an experimental color bomb.

186
00:15:38,423 --> 00:15:44,907
By building a conflict around these rewards that was grounded into the game world directly,

187
00:15:45,227 --> 00:15:51,711
we were able to build a foundation of understanding around the game's power-up boosters.

188
00:15:51,731 --> 00:15:55,133
And also, we were able to motivate the players to earn them.

189
00:15:55,892 --> 00:16:02,639
We tied the sequential action of the event directly to the level progression as well.

190
00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:07,644
And this synthesized the action and feeling of chasing a villain

191
00:16:07,764 --> 00:16:10,968
throughout the game world and along the saga map.

192
00:16:11,328 --> 00:16:17,215
which took a saga map that was relatively static, beyond a few animations,

193
00:16:17,535 --> 00:16:21,059
and brought a sense of life to it that was previously lacking.

194
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:23,421
It all of a sudden felt like it was more dynamic,

195
00:16:23,502 --> 00:16:26,205
and that anything could happen in the candy kingdom.

196
00:16:28,667 --> 00:16:32,291
After finding success with these smaller events, we decided to raise the stakes.

197
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:37,116
With our Saltnado event, players were given a specific call to action.

198
00:16:37,676 --> 00:16:41,159
Bubblegum Troll had unleashed a salty tornado on Candy Town

199
00:16:41,219 --> 00:16:43,300
and crystallized the buildings and characters.

200
00:16:44,001 --> 00:16:48,124
Players had to use the magical power of candy matching to save the Candy Kingdom.

201
00:16:49,405 --> 00:16:53,548
We used newspaper headlines to punctuate the stages of this event

202
00:16:54,449 --> 00:17:00,313
and the narrative beats to highlight the drama and the cliffhangers

203
00:17:00,413 --> 00:17:02,775
in bite-sized and highly visual ways.

204
00:17:04,904 --> 00:17:10,766
And while doing that, we reinforced the narrative with a salty scene that players transformed to sweet.

205
00:17:11,847 --> 00:17:16,668
They would complete levels, earning a magical sweet energy,

206
00:17:17,108 --> 00:17:24,471
and then they'd use that energy to free the buildings and characters from their crystallized, salty traps,

207
00:17:24,951 --> 00:17:26,952
revealing the sweetness within.

208
00:17:28,893 --> 00:17:33,034
I'm hoping that you can see the power of all three Cs at play here.

209
00:17:34,371 --> 00:17:40,013
We started by contextualizing the gameplay and using the sweetness of the candy matching to

210
00:17:40,273 --> 00:17:46,355
influence and change the game world. We used our character relationships to drive the action

211
00:17:46,695 --> 00:17:52,137
and create motivation through emotional connection. And then we raised the stakes

212
00:17:52,177 --> 00:17:57,698
for the greater conflict that players had a direct hand in being able to execute change in.

213
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:03,320
Our aim here was to give the candy matching meaning.

214
00:18:08,283 --> 00:18:12,946
We decided to take that experiment and explore it further in Candy Crush Soda as well,

215
00:18:13,966 --> 00:18:20,349
where we created a conflict in Candy Town by covering it in bubblegum

216
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:25,352
as a way to reveal the newly styled 3D version of Bubblegum Troll.

217
00:18:26,733 --> 00:18:32,075
We wanted to make sure that we were blending context, character, and conflict even further with this event.

218
00:18:37,467 --> 00:18:45,048
And so, we created a conflict that was specifically visually tied to the character and certain

219
00:18:45,088 --> 00:18:51,069
gameplay elements, and then made sure to contextualize the gameplay activities into that conflict.

220
00:18:52,310 --> 00:19:00,651
We used our themed achievement system to theme it around creating a situation where the player

221
00:19:00,671 --> 00:19:03,872
could remove some bubblegum and reveal the character.

222
00:19:05,034 --> 00:19:08,258
We directed the player activities through the progression system,

223
00:19:08,619 --> 00:19:11,603
which deepened the narrative and gameplay integration,

224
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:14,587
while also giving the player directed activities

225
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:18,392
and giving them the opportunity to explore Soda

226
00:19:18,452 --> 00:19:21,175
and realize that there was always something fun happening.

227
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:28,262
And because we made the unveiling of the character an event in itself

228
00:19:28,562 --> 00:19:32,563
and devoted an entire event's worth of content to it,

229
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:36,144
we were able to introduce key character traits

230
00:19:36,724 --> 00:19:41,805
in a bite-sized and fun way that actually fit the play style

231
00:19:42,245 --> 00:19:45,046
without interrupting moment-to-moment gameplay.

232
00:19:52,048 --> 00:19:52,308
Bye!

233
00:19:53,677 --> 00:19:59,981
Conflict doesn't always need to be centered around soda floods, bubble trouble, saltnatos.

234
00:20:01,523 --> 00:20:07,607
We gotta give our characters a break sometimes. So we have peppered some of these through with some

235
00:20:08,287 --> 00:20:12,610
humorous slice-of-life elements that are smaller parts of conflict.

236
00:20:13,751 --> 00:20:18,054
We recently experimented with integrating gameplay into our reward system

237
00:20:18,474 --> 00:20:22,337
by adding this humorous conflict to an event in Candy Crush Saga.

238
00:20:23,577 --> 00:20:28,161
In this event, we temporarily transformed our purple candies into hearts

239
00:20:28,601 --> 00:20:33,085
and asked players to help Misty the unicorn fill her box back up,

240
00:20:33,526 --> 00:20:37,569
which had mysteriously emptied right before her big date.

241
00:20:39,411 --> 00:20:42,514
This charming slice-of-life scene gave our players

242
00:20:42,834 --> 00:20:46,738
a glimpse into a humorous moment with Misty the unicorn.

243
00:20:48,008 --> 00:20:51,590
Now, don't let the simplicity of this event fool you.

244
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:55,012
It was actually extremely popular with our players.

245
00:20:55,772 --> 00:20:58,593
We found the perfect blend of contextualizing

246
00:20:58,933 --> 00:21:01,215
the activity of collecting candies

247
00:21:01,615 --> 00:21:03,836
and reinforcing that by further

248
00:21:03,856 --> 00:21:05,557
metaphorizing a gameplay element.

249
00:21:06,622 --> 00:21:10,063
And when we combined that with a simple everyday conflict

250
00:21:10,703 --> 00:21:14,085
and the humorous use of a popular but lesser known character,

251
00:21:14,545 --> 00:21:17,986
we were able to find a blend of ingredients and techniques

252
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:20,367
that really resonated with our player base.

253
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:27,691
Thank you for joining me on the journey

254
00:21:27,771 --> 00:21:30,512
that we've had in Candy Crush Saga

255
00:21:30,812 --> 00:21:34,053
and Candy Crush Soda so far with our story-driven events.

256
00:21:35,314 --> 00:21:38,236
I hope you've been able to follow my trail of breadcrumbs.

257
00:21:39,936 --> 00:21:44,719
If you do remember anything from our adventures today, I hope you'll remember the recipe.

258
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:51,982
Once again, it starts with the core ingredients, or three Cs.

259
00:21:52,963 --> 00:21:56,585
Context, characters, and conflict.

260
00:21:59,387 --> 00:22:05,353
You want to experiment with these and find the right blend that works for your game and for your event mechanics.

261
00:22:05,933 --> 00:22:18,426
But once you do, you want to experiment with your gameplay integration and come up with the right technique that's going to build the strength of your event and hold all of those pieces together.

262
00:22:19,127 --> 00:22:20,688
Remember, like kneading dough.

263
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:27,860
Blending all of your narrative components directly into gameplay in a deep, coherent,

264
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:34,644
integrated manner is going to create this meaningful impact within your game, an emotional

265
00:22:34,704 --> 00:22:35,285
connection.

266
00:22:36,846 --> 00:22:42,510
If you can perfect your game's recipe, I think you'll find that story-driven event moments

267
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:49,074
can lead your players on a sweet journey that will keep them engaged and entertained.

268
00:22:54,942 --> 00:22:58,106
I'm Abigail Rindo, and this has been Narrative Breadcrumbs.

269
00:22:59,068 --> 00:23:03,373
Thanks for joining, and I look forward to answering your questions.
