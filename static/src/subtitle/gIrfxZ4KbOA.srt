1
00:00:05,681 --> 00:00:06,822
So, my name is Chelsea Howe.

2
00:00:07,703 --> 00:00:12,348
I spent the last eight years in the free-to-play space doing a bunch of different projects

3
00:00:12,649 --> 00:00:15,251
and I'm now working at Alchemy Labs in VR.

4
00:00:16,733 --> 00:00:20,697
And one of the things that was consistent throughout my time in free-to-play was just

5
00:00:20,717 --> 00:00:21,718
that, this idea of time.

6
00:00:23,111 --> 00:00:26,472
It's the underlying foundation for a lot of free-to-play mechanics, and yet one thing

7
00:00:26,492 --> 00:00:29,914
that I noticed was that people don't usually think about time over time.

8
00:00:30,554 --> 00:00:34,656
We think a lot about short-term gains, little spikes, but we don't really understand human

9
00:00:34,696 --> 00:00:38,597
attention and behavior past kind of the daily to weekly stage.

10
00:00:39,718 --> 00:00:44,200
I think one of the major things that I saw was this tendency to underestimate how quickly

11
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,902
humans adapt to stimulus, which is just a fancy way of saying people get bored.

12
00:00:51,283 --> 00:00:52,363
As we see time becoming...

13
00:00:52,863 --> 00:00:54,844
more foundational in things beyond free-to-play

14
00:00:54,904 --> 00:00:57,166
in console and AAA, I think it's really vital

15
00:00:57,206 --> 00:00:58,947
to look at human behavior in psychology

16
00:00:58,967 --> 00:01:00,488
and understand how experiences

17
00:01:00,508 --> 00:01:02,029
can really engage people long-term.

18
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,591
After all, The Holy Grail would kind of be a game

19
00:01:04,611 --> 00:01:06,172
that lasts and is lucrative forever,

20
00:01:06,872 --> 00:01:08,293
independent of developer content.

21
00:01:09,874 --> 00:01:10,715
I don't know how to do that.

22
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:11,816
If I did, I wouldn't be here.

23
00:01:12,376 --> 00:01:13,617
But here's some pillars.

24
00:01:14,678 --> 00:01:16,599
So I want to start with player engagement over time.

25
00:01:17,997 --> 00:01:19,198
Now when I talk about player engagement,

26
00:01:19,218 --> 00:01:21,980
I'm not talking about any discrete metric,

27
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,562
so no DAU or MAU or some of the other things

28
00:01:24,582 --> 00:01:26,544
that we've used in the past.

29
00:01:26,904 --> 00:01:28,185
When I talk about player engagement,

30
00:01:28,245 --> 00:01:29,786
I'm talking a little bit more abstractly

31
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,668
about the time, attention, and mental effort

32
00:01:32,728 --> 00:01:33,709
a player gives to a game,

33
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:35,671
regardless of whether or not they're playing it.

34
00:01:36,131 --> 00:01:37,852
So essentially the psychological energy

35
00:01:37,892 --> 00:01:38,933
they're putting towards your game

36
00:01:39,393 --> 00:01:40,374
at any given point in time.

37
00:01:41,775 --> 00:01:43,096
And I wanna start by thinking about this

38
00:01:43,116 --> 00:01:44,918
through the lens of another area of our lives

39
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,078
where we use the term engagement.

40
00:01:48,243 --> 00:01:49,784
After all, marriage is supposed to be this thing

41
00:01:49,804 --> 00:01:51,444
that lasts for life, even if statistically

42
00:01:51,484 --> 00:01:53,105
we haven't been doing a super great job of that.

43
00:01:53,705 --> 00:01:55,365
But the lens of relationship psychology

44
00:01:55,425 --> 00:01:57,245
is still really helpful as we think about our games.

45
00:01:58,606 --> 00:02:00,586
After all, historically, developers wanted to see

46
00:02:00,626 --> 00:02:01,666
players fall in love with them,

47
00:02:02,126 --> 00:02:04,027
to really grab them and get them engrossed,

48
00:02:04,047 --> 00:02:06,007
and for each day to be better and more exciting

49
00:02:06,047 --> 00:02:06,727
than the one before.

50
00:02:07,968 --> 00:02:10,108
And we know that that's not really how relationships work.

51
00:02:11,769 --> 00:02:14,269
But love in the short term does start with infatuation,

52
00:02:14,289 --> 00:02:15,769
and this is the typical peak we see

53
00:02:15,809 --> 00:02:17,210
when players first pick up a game.

54
00:02:17,681 --> 00:02:19,902
We see them binge, we see longer player sessions,

55
00:02:19,982 --> 00:02:21,383
more frequent sessions per day.

56
00:02:22,023 --> 00:02:24,885
But this phase of engagement is inherently transient.

57
00:02:25,705 --> 00:02:27,426
The getting to know you rollercoaster never lasts

58
00:02:27,466 --> 00:02:29,648
because we as humans are designed to adapt

59
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:30,548
and find patterns.

60
00:02:30,968 --> 00:02:32,449
We're designed to get bored.

61
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,471
This is how our brain optimizes to live in our world.

62
00:02:36,712 --> 00:02:38,072
Even the most beautiful rock in the world

63
00:02:38,593 --> 00:02:39,773
is going to become background noise

64
00:02:39,813 --> 00:02:41,074
if it's on your finger every day.

65
00:02:41,434 --> 00:02:43,255
And that's just a result of how we as humans

66
00:02:43,295 --> 00:02:44,056
process stimulus.

67
00:02:46,361 --> 00:02:49,202
At the most basic level, whenever we receive a stimulus,

68
00:02:49,642 --> 00:02:51,903
we tend to pass it through the list of our basic needs.

69
00:02:52,024 --> 00:02:53,904
Can I eat it, mate with it, or will it kill me?

70
00:02:54,685 --> 00:02:57,666
Once we've done that, our engagement starts to fall off.

71
00:02:58,046 --> 00:03:00,447
We run it against some of our higher order cognitive needs.

72
00:03:02,028 --> 00:03:05,429
And I want to point out that this graph is not accurate.

73
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:08,091
The peak and amplitude, the rate of decay,

74
00:03:08,211 --> 00:03:10,612
all of that is dependent on different personal factors

75
00:03:10,652 --> 00:03:12,773
and factors with the stimulus and content itself.

76
00:03:13,422 --> 00:03:14,723
I'm going to use those two words,

77
00:03:14,783 --> 00:03:17,184
stimulus and content, relatively interchangeably.

78
00:03:17,624 --> 00:03:19,885
Any piece of content is going to be a stimulus

79
00:03:19,925 --> 00:03:22,506
that evokes some form of player attention and engagement.

80
00:03:23,967 --> 00:03:25,447
Now the other half of this curve,

81
00:03:25,707 --> 00:03:27,388
if we know that the stimulus is coming up,

82
00:03:27,448 --> 00:03:28,869
is this idea of anticipation.

83
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:31,370
This essentially means that we get engagement

84
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,211
before we actually even give the player something.

85
00:03:34,531 --> 00:03:36,052
Now I mentioned that it doesn't usually look

86
00:03:36,072 --> 00:03:37,012
like a bell curve at all.

87
00:03:37,432 --> 00:03:39,693
But the one thing, regardless of that decay rate

88
00:03:39,733 --> 00:03:42,975
and amplitude or the rise of the anticipation.

89
00:03:43,358 --> 00:03:45,080
is that it's going to go down over time.

90
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:46,841
It will decay.

91
00:03:47,241 --> 00:03:48,562
And this is just a natural result

92
00:03:48,802 --> 00:03:50,503
of some of our neurological tendencies.

93
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:52,705
So here's a few different

94
00:03:52,745 --> 00:03:54,065
perception-based reasons for this.

95
00:03:54,106 --> 00:03:55,927
This is a small, small subset.

96
00:03:55,967 --> 00:03:56,847
If you're interested in this,

97
00:03:57,308 --> 00:03:59,629
I highly recommend looking up a few basic UX books

98
00:03:59,689 --> 00:04:01,010
on principles of human attention.

99
00:04:02,751 --> 00:04:03,952
So the first thing that I want to talk about

100
00:04:03,992 --> 00:04:05,913
is that we're hardwired to find patterns in the world.

101
00:04:06,314 --> 00:04:07,314
As soon as we find a pattern,

102
00:04:07,354 --> 00:04:09,135
it means our brain doesn't have to do so much work

103
00:04:09,195 --> 00:04:10,496
and we can attend to other things.

104
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,341
Once we find a pattern, we only pay attention

105
00:04:13,401 --> 00:04:15,721
to the way that some sort of stimulus deviates from it.

106
00:04:16,462 --> 00:04:18,202
This also means that as soon as we recognize

107
00:04:18,242 --> 00:04:20,002
a piece of content that follows a pattern,

108
00:04:20,322 --> 00:04:21,663
we're not going to get the full amount

109
00:04:21,963 --> 00:04:23,163
of engagement we normally would.

110
00:04:24,023 --> 00:04:26,504
We saw this a lot early on in so-called golden mechanics.

111
00:04:26,964 --> 00:04:29,264
It turns out that golden mechanics were really

112
00:04:29,304 --> 00:04:30,805
just easily repeatable patterns,

113
00:04:31,165 --> 00:04:33,245
and the initial spikes of engagement that we got from them

114
00:04:33,605 --> 00:04:34,586
didn't hold up over time.

115
00:04:36,266 --> 00:04:37,706
The next thing we do is that we chunk things.

116
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:40,047
The iconic example of this in UX

117
00:04:40,167 --> 00:04:41,167
is the idea of phone numbers.

118
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,815
it's much easier to remember three chunks of numbers

119
00:04:43,855 --> 00:04:45,175
than 10 individual numbers.

120
00:04:45,835 --> 00:04:47,136
However, this also means that we don't get

121
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:48,956
10 individual spikes of stimulus,

122
00:04:49,036 --> 00:04:50,817
nor the sum of 10 individual parts.

123
00:04:50,877 --> 00:04:52,397
We get something a little bit less than that.

124
00:04:53,518 --> 00:04:55,779
You can see this in games in something like Pokemon,

125
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:57,899
where when I spin a specific PokeStop,

126
00:04:58,619 --> 00:05:00,560
I don't get an individual spike of engagement

127
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,580
for each item that drops.

128
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,801
I just get this collective chunked idea of a PokeSpin.

129
00:05:07,062 --> 00:05:09,063
And I think the biggest one is that we tend to normalize.

130
00:05:10,329 --> 00:05:13,292
Put simply, everyone has a different base emotional level.

131
00:05:14,133 --> 00:05:15,814
And that base emotional level

132
00:05:15,914 --> 00:05:17,776
isn't what determines how we feel.

133
00:05:18,336 --> 00:05:20,258
What determines how we feel on any given day

134
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,780
is the way that the stimulus we're exposed to

135
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,422
deviates from that baseline.

136
00:05:24,962 --> 00:05:26,344
So on the plus side, this means that no matter

137
00:05:26,384 --> 00:05:28,145
how great or terrible your life is,

138
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:31,308
on any given day, you're designed to exist and survive

139
00:05:31,348 --> 00:05:32,389
to continue moving forward.

140
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,370
So just being able to feed your family

141
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,210
might feel as good as someone with a relatively

142
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:38,511
low experiential baseline,

143
00:05:38,991 --> 00:05:40,451
as closing a billion dollar acquisition

144
00:05:40,491 --> 00:05:43,232
for someone with a relatively high experiential baseline.

145
00:05:44,672 --> 00:05:47,113
Now unfortunately, if we continue to give people

146
00:05:47,173 --> 00:05:49,593
these spikes, that doesn't mean that we're going

147
00:05:49,633 --> 00:05:51,154
to give them bigger and bigger emotions.

148
00:05:51,474 --> 00:05:53,614
What it means is that we're going to elevate their baseline.

149
00:05:55,175 --> 00:05:58,395
So essentially, just like in Adrenaline Junkies,

150
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,736
the first high that we get is never going to be the same.

151
00:06:02,827 --> 00:06:04,389
Okay, so that sounds a little bit dire,

152
00:06:04,409 --> 00:06:05,910
but I wanna look again at relationships.

153
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,691
We know that some of them have to work.

154
00:06:07,852 --> 00:06:09,593
After all, we still exist.

155
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:11,735
So what does that transition look like?

156
00:06:11,855 --> 00:06:14,137
How do we get players from that initial infatuation

157
00:06:14,197 --> 00:06:15,218
to a place where they're willing

158
00:06:15,258 --> 00:06:16,819
to be more intimate and committed?

159
00:06:18,481 --> 00:06:20,422
The first thing we need to do is not panic

160
00:06:20,462 --> 00:06:21,884
when that initial spike wears off.

161
00:06:22,584 --> 00:06:24,106
In the early days of getting mass data,

162
00:06:24,146 --> 00:06:25,287
we saw this all the time.

163
00:06:25,467 --> 00:06:27,448
We'd see the slightest little dip in engagement

164
00:06:27,468 --> 00:06:28,750
and we'd set off all of the alarms.

165
00:06:29,543 --> 00:06:31,064
people would get called in the middle of the night.

166
00:06:31,805 --> 00:06:33,606
The end result was that we were constantly trying

167
00:06:33,646 --> 00:06:35,627
to show bigger, better, grander things at players,

168
00:06:35,988 --> 00:06:38,549
all the time, throwing any micro dip in their attention.

169
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,291
Now the result for players was exhausting.

170
00:06:42,072 --> 00:06:43,893
We wound up making our average players feel like

171
00:06:43,913 --> 00:06:46,034
they were missing out, and driving our highly engaged

172
00:06:46,074 --> 00:06:48,236
players into this unsustainable frenzy.

173
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,398
And the downside is that once you start on this path,

174
00:06:51,938 --> 00:06:54,358
there's really not a lot of options besides continuing.

175
00:06:54,738 --> 00:06:56,238
You've elevated the expectations

176
00:06:56,278 --> 00:06:57,619
for your highly engaged players.

177
00:06:57,659 --> 00:06:59,759
You've basically trained them to constantly want more.

178
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,440
At the same time, your average players

179
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,100
start seeing a higher and higher gap

180
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,080
between their experience and the experience

181
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,280
of these highly engaged players.

182
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,201
They start seeing fewer and fewer reasons to stick around.

183
00:07:12,061 --> 00:07:13,581
So instead of more, more, more, more, more,

184
00:07:13,721 --> 00:07:15,442
what we have to do is start looking at ways

185
00:07:15,982 --> 00:07:17,742
to say enough to our players.

186
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:21,193
Instead of striving for this ever increasing engagement,

187
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:23,675
we need to get them into a habituated series

188
00:07:23,715 --> 00:07:24,935
of cycles of engagement.

189
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:29,157
In the same way that we need rest in order to be able

190
00:07:29,177 --> 00:07:31,778
to act, we need relief between these periods

191
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:32,939
of attentional arousal.

192
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,661
So there's a lot of really common ways to do this.

193
00:07:37,021 --> 00:07:39,282
In a game like Choices, you can read whatever you want,

194
00:07:39,802 --> 00:07:41,443
but you can only read a chapter every few hours.

195
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,764
In something like Wow, you can battle your pets

196
00:07:43,784 --> 00:07:45,485
all the time, but on weekends,

197
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:47,106
it's going to be faster and more rewarding.

198
00:07:48,221 --> 00:07:49,542
And in something like Clash Royale,

199
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:52,223
you can continue to attack as often as you want,

200
00:07:52,483 --> 00:07:55,585
but that high reward, the chests, are inherently limited.

201
00:07:56,386 --> 00:07:58,027
And I want to talk about that one specifically,

202
00:07:58,567 --> 00:08:00,328
because I remember being in design meetings

203
00:08:00,448 --> 00:08:01,789
and hearing other designers say,

204
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:03,510
myself included, actually,

205
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,492
I can't believe how blatant this chest limit is.

206
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,633
They're not even trying to hide it anymore.

207
00:08:09,974 --> 00:08:11,194
And I want to talk about why that's brilliant.

208
00:08:12,115 --> 00:08:14,076
Because another cornerstone of healthy relationships

209
00:08:14,096 --> 00:08:16,697
that are designed to last is trust and consent.

210
00:08:17,735 --> 00:08:21,178
Now, I know that those are heavy words, but we as developers really want engagement.

211
00:08:21,278 --> 00:08:23,700
After all, we live in an engagement economy.

212
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,462
Attention is essentially our coin.

213
00:08:26,322 --> 00:08:28,404
So we really, really want those players to like us.

214
00:08:29,225 --> 00:08:30,366
So we try to get their attention.

215
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:32,928
And we don't always do it in the healthiest of ways.

216
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:37,021
Now a lot of us are familiar with M'Chay Tshikszentm'Chay,

217
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:40,102
apologies, for his work on flow,

218
00:08:40,162 --> 00:08:42,603
but he also did a lot of work on taxonomies of attention.

219
00:08:43,103 --> 00:08:44,024
He said that there are essentially

220
00:08:44,084 --> 00:08:45,344
two categories of attention.

221
00:08:45,744 --> 00:08:48,866
One is voluntary, we choose to attend and focus on something

222
00:08:49,386 --> 00:08:50,766
and the other one is compulsory,

223
00:08:51,027 --> 00:08:53,047
which means our attention is essentially demanded

224
00:08:53,468 --> 00:08:54,968
by some sort of perceived emotional,

225
00:08:55,008 --> 00:08:56,309
biological or social need.

226
00:08:57,969 --> 00:09:00,230
Now I wanna point out that by definition,

227
00:09:00,811 --> 00:09:03,152
compelling attention is non-consensual.

228
00:09:06,383 --> 00:09:12,285
And for that reason, compelling attention will always perform better in your A-B tests.

229
00:09:14,046 --> 00:09:19,249
Of course, forcing someone to do something is going to get you the results you want more

230
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:20,529
than letting them choose to do it.

231
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:25,151
And this is why we see these techniques all the time in games.

232
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,552
It's why we see them all the time on TV.

233
00:09:28,373 --> 00:09:31,034
And it's why we see them all the time in our social feeds.

234
00:09:32,034 --> 00:09:32,835
And this is repulsive.

235
00:09:34,203 --> 00:09:36,586
This is using sensationalism and implied risk

236
00:09:36,786 --> 00:09:38,808
to force us to attend to something.

237
00:09:39,549 --> 00:09:40,850
This should infuriate all of us.

238
00:09:41,811 --> 00:09:44,733
This diminishes our agency and our autonomy as humans.

239
00:09:45,654 --> 00:09:47,936
Those are the very things that make us human.

240
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:54,062
But the data, the promise of profit

241
00:09:54,182 --> 00:09:57,165
is not permission for unethical action.

242
00:10:03,505 --> 00:10:05,146
If you're going to treat data as permission

243
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:06,527
to act immorally and unethically,

244
00:10:06,627 --> 00:10:08,228
to put your business ahead of the people

245
00:10:08,248 --> 00:10:09,509
that you are supposed to be serving,

246
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:11,631
then I want you all to think about

247
00:10:11,731 --> 00:10:13,172
what the future is going to look like

248
00:10:13,392 --> 00:10:14,973
in this data-driven world.

249
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,155
If you use data as an excuse,

250
00:10:18,796 --> 00:10:21,938
as a way to alleviate your own responsibility in a situation,

251
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:25,241
that isn't creating a relationship.

252
00:10:25,861 --> 00:10:27,802
This is 21st century enslavement.

253
00:10:28,563 --> 00:10:30,584
We no longer need to hook people up

254
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:31,725
to get their physical labor.

255
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,921
but we live in an engagement economy

256
00:10:34,282 --> 00:10:35,843
and we're stealing people's attention.

257
00:10:37,824 --> 00:10:39,045
So I don't care what your data says.

258
00:10:39,986 --> 00:10:41,607
Data is a manifestation of action.

259
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:43,489
It's a means of tracking behavior

260
00:10:43,969 --> 00:10:46,471
and data is oblivious to the human condition.

261
00:10:47,548 --> 00:10:49,069
Just because you can do something,

262
00:10:49,409 --> 00:10:51,130
just because something would make you more money,

263
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,430
doesn't mean that you should do it.

264
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:55,831
Because regardless of how ubiquitous these techniques are,

265
00:10:56,011 --> 00:10:57,932
they are fundamentally dark design.

266
00:10:59,032 --> 00:11:02,293
All dark design does is slowly erode trust and faith

267
00:11:02,393 --> 00:11:03,934
in people's autonomy over their time.

268
00:11:05,154 --> 00:11:06,335
And when we reduce people

269
00:11:06,475 --> 00:11:08,175
to just those animalistic impulses,

270
00:11:08,515 --> 00:11:09,976
those things that we cannot control,

271
00:11:09,996 --> 00:11:12,697
we are reducing people to animals.

272
00:11:13,197 --> 00:11:14,597
We are removing their personhood.

273
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:18,189
And we're already starting to see the horrific results of this.

274
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:24,472
As our own capacity to focus our attention is lost to this constant barrage of alarm

275
00:11:24,532 --> 00:11:28,973
and fear in media, we are sinking into a world ruled by those fears.

276
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:34,575
If you were at any of the UX talks these past two days, one consistent theme was that when

277
00:11:34,595 --> 00:11:39,777
we are afraid, we do not grow, we do not learn, and we do not flourish.

278
00:11:40,877 --> 00:11:42,318
So think about what that future looks like.

279
00:11:44,002 --> 00:11:47,126
This was supposed to be about games, so let's go back to Clash Royale.

280
00:11:48,328 --> 00:11:48,848
Everyone was right.

281
00:11:49,249 --> 00:11:51,031
They aren't trying to hide anything.

282
00:11:51,552 --> 00:11:54,856
And in doing so, they're actually giving players more control over whether or not they choose

283
00:11:54,876 --> 00:11:55,698
to attend to a game.

284
00:11:56,158 --> 00:11:59,903
They're letting players decide whether or not engagement is worth it instead of obfuscating

285
00:11:59,983 --> 00:12:01,365
and disguising their demands for time.

286
00:12:02,754 --> 00:12:04,415
When we're clear with our boundaries and limitations,

287
00:12:04,435 --> 00:12:05,897
we're actually being more respectful.

288
00:12:06,257 --> 00:12:07,758
We're being less deceitful, more upfront,

289
00:12:07,798 --> 00:12:09,319
and allowing informed negotiation.

290
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,562
That is what builds trust and faith over time,

291
00:12:13,142 --> 00:12:14,784
even if it can be hard at a stomach at first.

292
00:12:16,525 --> 00:12:17,866
So let's talk about that hard at a stomach.

293
00:12:19,528 --> 00:12:21,029
Let's talk about player perception of time.

294
00:12:23,431 --> 00:12:24,972
Now the role of time in free-to-play games

295
00:12:25,032 --> 00:12:26,333
is essentially a pacing tool.

296
00:12:26,793 --> 00:12:28,415
It controls the consumption of content.

297
00:12:29,507 --> 00:12:31,468
Like any temporal art, pacing is really vital

298
00:12:31,508 --> 00:12:32,649
to a well-designed experience.

299
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:34,510
But for games that depend heavily

300
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:35,811
on developer-created content,

301
00:12:36,231 --> 00:12:37,952
it's also one of the only ways to survive,

302
00:12:38,012 --> 00:12:41,294
which means we have a very large capacity

303
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:44,817
to try to get that pacing in ways that aren't always healthy.

304
00:12:45,977 --> 00:12:47,938
So how do we surface time in a way

305
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:49,399
that players perceive positively?

306
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,521
How do we integrate it into that healthy relationship

307
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:52,081
we want to create?

308
00:12:53,595 --> 00:12:55,396
There's a few different techniques for surfacing time.

309
00:12:55,436 --> 00:12:58,378
There's direct timers, and that's exactly what it sounds

310
00:12:58,418 --> 00:12:59,858
like, a little two-hour countdown.

311
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:02,960
There's indirect inclusion of time,

312
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,281
which is where something might take 200 mana,

313
00:13:05,681 --> 00:13:07,502
and you generate 100 mana per hour.

314
00:13:07,862 --> 00:13:09,503
Again, those are functionally identical.

315
00:13:09,883 --> 00:13:12,765
They both delay your consumption of content for two hours.

316
00:13:13,605 --> 00:13:15,606
But they feel, and can feel, very different.

317
00:13:17,132 --> 00:13:18,772
One thing that affects the way a timer feels

318
00:13:18,852 --> 00:13:20,393
is verisimilitude in context.

319
00:13:20,813 --> 00:13:22,633
Verisimilitude is a fancy way of saying,

320
00:13:22,934 --> 00:13:24,714
does it fit with an existing player model?

321
00:13:26,295 --> 00:13:28,956
If you have something like crops needing time to grow,

322
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:30,676
that fits with our existing mental model.

323
00:13:30,716 --> 00:13:32,937
It's going to feel better than something like

324
00:13:33,157 --> 00:13:35,198
keys randomly sprouting every three hours.

325
00:13:36,714 --> 00:13:38,635
The other difference between direct and indirect timers

326
00:13:38,715 --> 00:13:41,476
is that indirect timers actually let us have some autonomy

327
00:13:41,536 --> 00:13:42,557
over our time equity.

328
00:13:42,977 --> 00:13:45,558
We build up that 200 mana and we don't necessarily

329
00:13:45,598 --> 00:13:47,299
have to use it on one specific thing.

330
00:13:47,699 --> 00:13:50,001
We can use that investment of time that we have

331
00:13:50,081 --> 00:13:50,981
whatever way we want.

332
00:13:52,522 --> 00:13:54,543
The final way to surface time is implicitly.

333
00:13:54,643 --> 00:13:56,364
So this means that some mechanic in your game

334
00:13:56,584 --> 00:13:58,125
literally takes time to complete.

335
00:13:58,205 --> 00:13:59,685
So something like just walking around

336
00:13:59,745 --> 00:14:02,327
and catching Pokemon in Pokemon Go takes time.

337
00:14:02,407 --> 00:14:03,607
It takes time to move your body

338
00:14:03,647 --> 00:14:04,708
from one location to another.

339
00:14:06,468 --> 00:14:09,390
And this used to be considered the golden standard

340
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:10,270
in console era.

341
00:14:10,871 --> 00:14:13,253
But what it means is that we don't get any benefit

342
00:14:13,293 --> 00:14:15,254
from a game unless we are paying full

343
00:14:15,514 --> 00:14:16,755
and complete attention to it.

344
00:14:17,295 --> 00:14:19,317
And that doesn't always feel good either.

345
00:14:20,838 --> 00:14:23,039
So essentially what I'm saying is that none of these

346
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:24,120
are specifically right.

347
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,722
It's all about how you use them, not which one you use.

348
00:14:26,762 --> 00:14:28,143
And some of the most successful games,

349
00:14:28,163 --> 00:14:29,344
the ones that feel the best,

350
00:14:29,844 --> 00:14:31,405
utilize all of these in different ways.

351
00:14:33,468 --> 00:14:34,950
But because direct timers tend to get

352
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:37,774
that unusually bad reputation, like they did in Clash,

353
00:14:38,174 --> 00:14:39,616
I want to point out another benefit

354
00:14:39,656 --> 00:14:41,278
of being completely up front

355
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,381
with how much time you have

356
00:14:43,421 --> 00:14:44,602
until your next piece of stimulus.

357
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:48,127
And that's the creation of rhythm and ritual.

358
00:14:48,557 --> 00:14:50,138
Essentially, if we're told every day

359
00:14:50,178 --> 00:14:53,298
that we can come back and get a little bit of new content,

360
00:14:53,998 --> 00:14:55,099
that's going to help create

361
00:14:55,119 --> 00:14:57,539
that habituated cycle of engagement.

362
00:14:57,599 --> 00:14:58,339
That's what we want.

363
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,800
And then ideally, what we do is we layer those over time.

364
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,901
So we create pieces of content at different time intervals.

365
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,841
And as those stack, you wind up

366
00:15:06,881 --> 00:15:08,282
with a steadily increasing curve

367
00:15:08,302 --> 00:15:09,602
that looks a lot like a flow curve.

368
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:10,642
This is awesome.

369
00:15:13,414 --> 00:15:14,915
So the things that I mentioned previously

370
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:17,397
were all usually either a moment-to-moment session

371
00:15:17,657 --> 00:15:19,098
or daily types of stimulus.

372
00:15:19,158 --> 00:15:20,779
So I wanna just point out a few examples

373
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:23,461
of people who are doing longer timescale rituals

374
00:15:23,501 --> 00:15:24,202
relatively well.

375
00:15:25,122 --> 00:15:27,364
In Summoner's War, you have, and a bunch of other games,

376
00:15:27,404 --> 00:15:28,765
you have things that change every day.

377
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:30,346
So if you need a specific resource,

378
00:15:30,366 --> 00:15:32,127
you can say, ah, I need to come back on Wednesday.

379
00:15:33,528 --> 00:15:35,009
In a game like Hollywood University,

380
00:15:35,069 --> 00:15:38,351
leveling up characters is required to unlock new content,

381
00:15:38,411 --> 00:15:40,733
but leveling up a character can take up to two weeks

382
00:15:40,913 --> 00:15:41,533
at later levels.

383
00:15:43,249 --> 00:15:45,451
In games like Ingress or Neopets,

384
00:15:45,491 --> 00:15:47,773
which has been around for well over a decade,

385
00:15:48,174 --> 00:15:50,856
you have different badges and forms of social signifiers

386
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,958
that can take from half a year in this case

387
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,881
to over a year in the case of Neopets.

388
00:15:57,182 --> 00:15:59,104
Look at that, you just have to have a snow bunny for a year.

389
00:16:00,185 --> 00:16:01,806
Then you have games like Fallen London,

390
00:16:02,267 --> 00:16:05,009
where rewards can stack over multiple years.

391
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:06,731
So when you come back the next year,

392
00:16:06,771 --> 00:16:07,612
you actually get something

393
00:16:07,632 --> 00:16:08,853
that wasn't available the first year.

394
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,511
And taking this to its most extreme,

395
00:16:11,551 --> 00:16:13,172
you can look at something like EVE Online,

396
00:16:13,212 --> 00:16:15,274
where the total time to complete all skills

397
00:16:15,334 --> 00:16:17,936
is estimated between 18 and 25 years.

398
00:16:17,956 --> 00:16:21,519
All right, so 25 years is a really long time.

399
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,081
It's not something that we tend to talk about.

400
00:16:24,121 --> 00:16:26,143
I've never heard someone look at that time scale

401
00:16:26,183 --> 00:16:29,145
in a design discussion unless I was the one instigating it.

402
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,528
By imagining a long-term relationship with players,

403
00:16:33,452 --> 00:16:35,013
We can start surfacing little things

404
00:16:35,073 --> 00:16:36,734
that help prime them for the idea

405
00:16:36,774 --> 00:16:39,235
that maybe this game is worth more than just a few days

406
00:16:39,315 --> 00:16:40,696
or a week or a month of their time.

407
00:16:42,136 --> 00:16:44,017
If they go in assuming something's going to be

408
00:16:44,057 --> 00:16:47,138
a quick fling, that's probably going to be

409
00:16:47,178 --> 00:16:48,019
what their behavior is.

410
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,280
So I said the word surfacing.

411
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,861
So I want to point out that no matter how many

412
00:16:52,881 --> 00:16:55,742
of these rhythms you have, if you don't surface them,

413
00:16:55,822 --> 00:16:57,203
people can't anticipate them.

414
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,244
And they've done studies that have

415
00:16:59,955 --> 00:17:01,616
shown that people who take pictures of their food

416
00:17:01,696 --> 00:17:03,057
actually enjoy that food more,

417
00:17:03,177 --> 00:17:04,898
specifically because they have that moment

418
00:17:04,918 --> 00:17:06,638
of appreciation and anticipation.

419
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:08,779
I don't know if any of you guys remember

420
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,740
what Christmas Eve was like as a small child,

421
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,121
but I was pretty sure it was going to last until I died.

422
00:17:14,282 --> 00:17:14,982
So as you design,

423
00:17:15,322 --> 00:17:18,204
remember to give them the ability to anticipate.

424
00:17:18,264 --> 00:17:20,585
Remember to surface things so that players know they exist,

425
00:17:21,105 --> 00:17:23,266
and remember to do it in a way that's not really creepy.

426
00:17:23,446 --> 00:17:25,147
If you start talking about being buried

427
00:17:25,187 --> 00:17:26,608
next to each other on the first date,

428
00:17:26,968 --> 00:17:27,988
that might be a bit of a turnoff.

429
00:17:29,727 --> 00:17:31,769
Okay, so how do you make anticipation

430
00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:32,969
a little bit more sustainable?

431
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,631
I talked about how variety in the pattern

432
00:17:35,671 --> 00:17:36,592
grabs our attention.

433
00:17:36,952 --> 00:17:39,474
Variability does the same thing for our anticipation,

434
00:17:39,494 --> 00:17:41,195
and that's essentially because we're optimists.

435
00:17:41,656 --> 00:17:43,517
If I say, imagine a plate of spaghetti,

436
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:46,039
you're probably not imagining a few dry,

437
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:47,520
cracked strands on a plate.

438
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:51,182
You're probably imagining that optimal version of spaghetti.

439
00:17:51,242 --> 00:17:52,783
You probably imagine a heaping plate

440
00:17:52,803 --> 00:17:53,704
with a little bit of sauce,

441
00:17:54,204 --> 00:17:56,346
and depending on what you like, maybe a few meatballs.

442
00:17:57,361 --> 00:17:59,022
So when there's variability and we know

443
00:17:59,062 --> 00:18:02,945
the potential outcomes, we tend to aim for the best one,

444
00:18:03,385 --> 00:18:05,086
even if that is very, very, very rare.

445
00:18:06,007 --> 00:18:09,049
Now of course this has huge opportunities for abuse.

446
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:10,610
So again, this is something that you can't

447
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:11,831
just implement blindly.

448
00:18:12,471 --> 00:18:14,292
You'll see one of the themes about this whole talk

449
00:18:14,352 --> 00:18:16,434
is actually taking responsibility for the decisions

450
00:18:16,474 --> 00:18:18,835
you make as designers and thinking about their impact

451
00:18:18,915 --> 00:18:20,136
on players and whether or not that's

452
00:18:20,156 --> 00:18:21,337
in the player's best interest.

453
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:25,160
Okay, so there's a lot of different ways to add variability.

454
00:18:28,158 --> 00:18:30,441
One of the most effective, quote unquote,

455
00:18:30,881 --> 00:18:33,405
is variable ratio, which means you tell people

456
00:18:33,425 --> 00:18:34,366
they're going to get something

457
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:35,728
after a certain number of actions,

458
00:18:36,128 --> 00:18:38,371
and you don't tell them how many actions that is,

459
00:18:38,471 --> 00:18:39,452
and it always changes.

460
00:18:40,193 --> 00:18:42,717
Now that leads to the most engagement,

461
00:18:42,877 --> 00:18:44,419
which means players will do that action

462
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:46,001
again and again and again and again.

463
00:18:49,006 --> 00:18:49,806
they'll binge, right?

464
00:18:49,847 --> 00:18:51,648
So that's the same behavior as we talked about earlier.

465
00:18:51,968 --> 00:18:53,109
They'll binge and they'll burn out.

466
00:18:53,409 --> 00:18:55,770
Now that doesn't mean that variable ratio is bad.

467
00:18:56,211 --> 00:18:58,772
It means that perhaps if you use variable ratio mechanics,

468
00:18:58,792 --> 00:19:00,834
they should be for a weekend blitz event.

469
00:19:01,334 --> 00:19:03,455
Or one day a week you get this variable ratio.

470
00:19:03,756 --> 00:19:06,397
Because those spikes of engagement are enjoyable.

471
00:19:07,018 --> 00:19:08,959
When you hit your 20th anniversary

472
00:19:08,999 --> 00:19:10,160
and Valentine's Day comes around,

473
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,701
that can be a fun time to spike your engagement,

474
00:19:12,721 --> 00:19:13,882
to do things you don't normally do.

475
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,481
So again, none of these things are inherently bad,

476
00:19:16,521 --> 00:19:18,081
but you need to think very consciously

477
00:19:18,122 --> 00:19:20,002
about the effect on the overall player experience.

478
00:19:21,723 --> 00:19:24,685
If you look at the worst implementation of variable reward,

479
00:19:24,725 --> 00:19:26,566
you get fixed interval, which essentially means

480
00:19:26,586 --> 00:19:28,306
you tell people when they're going to get a reward,

481
00:19:28,807 --> 00:19:30,648
and they tend not to engage as much

482
00:19:30,748 --> 00:19:32,008
until that time comes around.

483
00:19:32,548 --> 00:19:34,169
That is something that is much gentler,

484
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,390
and something that could work as a through line

485
00:19:36,991 --> 00:19:38,371
that's constantly present in your game.

486
00:19:39,972 --> 00:19:40,132
Okay.

487
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,271
So you do all of these, wow, we are running out of time.

488
00:19:43,451 --> 00:19:45,232
All right, I'm gonna switch this into quick mode.

489
00:19:46,673 --> 00:19:49,275
So you have this solid cadence of contents and events,

490
00:19:49,595 --> 00:19:50,976
it starts looking like a flow curve.

491
00:19:51,296 --> 00:19:52,457
But even if we just give people

492
00:19:52,497 --> 00:19:53,778
a tiny little bit of stimulus,

493
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:56,059
they're still going to wind up with this huge hoard of it.

494
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:57,780
And that gets into all sorts of problems

495
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:00,622
once you add social because your elder players are,

496
00:20:00,702 --> 00:20:02,443
you can't ever catch up to them as a new player.

497
00:20:02,483 --> 00:20:04,044
And that leads to all sorts of problems

498
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:06,605
in this healthy kind of social ecosystem

499
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:07,746
that I'll talk about a little bit later.

500
00:20:08,825 --> 00:20:11,006
So let's talk about how we can take that progress

501
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,228
and turn it from something that's completely linear

502
00:20:13,288 --> 00:20:14,929
into something that has a little bit more loops.

503
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:16,531
This is my beautiful art, thank you.

504
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:18,752
The first one is decay.

505
00:20:18,852 --> 00:20:20,393
So decay is a form of maintenance,

506
00:20:20,433 --> 00:20:22,195
which means a stack goes down over time

507
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:23,676
and must be continuously boosted.

508
00:20:24,353 --> 00:20:28,175
This is used in Kim Kardashian, where if you don't come back to the game, your partner

509
00:20:28,195 --> 00:20:28,736
will leave you.

510
00:20:28,976 --> 00:20:32,878
It is a horrific experience, especially because they ask you for premium currency to resolve

511
00:20:32,918 --> 00:20:33,098
this.

512
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:35,820
But again, the mechanic is not negative by default.

513
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:40,363
In something like Neopets, they use verisimilitude and context, just like I mentioned before,

514
00:20:40,683 --> 00:20:41,504
to make it feel better.

515
00:20:41,684 --> 00:20:44,105
We're used to, in the real world, pets needing food.

516
00:20:44,186 --> 00:20:46,607
So of course it makes sense that I need to consistently feed my pet.

517
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:50,254
Durability is basically user-driven decay.

518
00:20:50,294 --> 00:20:51,594
This tends to feel a little bit better

519
00:20:51,614 --> 00:20:53,515
because instead of decay being driven by time,

520
00:20:53,955 --> 00:20:56,016
it's driven by things that we do as players.

521
00:20:56,396 --> 00:20:58,016
A great example is tools in Minecraft.

522
00:20:59,097 --> 00:21:00,357
The next one is bounded decay.

523
00:21:00,737 --> 00:21:02,458
So this essentially means that a stat goes down

524
00:21:02,518 --> 00:21:03,899
over time up to a point.

525
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,760
This was something that we saw a lot in old RPGs.

526
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,920
Progress was getting from point A to point B.

527
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,001
Once you hit a save point,

528
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:13,062
the progress you'd made towards point B couldn't be revoked.

529
00:21:13,602 --> 00:21:16,423
Only the progress between that save point

530
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:17,183
and the next one could.

531
00:21:18,937 --> 00:21:20,818
The next type of decay is market-driven decay.

532
00:21:21,578 --> 00:21:23,839
You see this a lot in stock markets and style.

533
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,860
What this means is that the actual value,

534
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:29,341
the actual kind of properties of an item don't change,

535
00:21:29,941 --> 00:21:32,522
but the value changes because of the perspective of others.

536
00:21:32,622 --> 00:21:34,863
So you could have the hottest jacket in the world one week,

537
00:21:35,243 --> 00:21:36,703
and then the next week it's out of style,

538
00:21:36,743 --> 00:21:39,204
the color's wrong, and the cut doesn't look so good anymore.

539
00:21:40,805 --> 00:21:42,345
The next type of decay is other-driven decay.

540
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:43,766
So this is basically zero-sum.

541
00:21:43,806 --> 00:21:44,746
I think you all know about this.

542
00:21:45,386 --> 00:21:46,547
And then the final type of decay

543
00:21:46,567 --> 00:21:48,287
that I want to talk about is mandatory decay.

544
00:21:48,677 --> 00:21:50,179
So we're seeing this a lot in idle games,

545
00:21:50,219 --> 00:21:52,341
where you actually have to give up all of the progress

546
00:21:52,361 --> 00:21:53,882
that you've made in order to continue.

547
00:21:54,923 --> 00:21:57,625
You do get a little bit of meta-currency at the end,

548
00:21:57,825 --> 00:22:00,187
which then fuels into your next run through the game.

549
00:22:00,648 --> 00:22:03,230
The interesting thing about this is it gives players control

550
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,992
over the pacing of their own experience

551
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,033
in a really valuable way.

552
00:22:06,573 --> 00:22:07,674
Eventually, as you're moving through

553
00:22:07,714 --> 00:22:09,536
that first progress bar in an idle game,

554
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:10,136
the

555
00:22:10,982 --> 00:22:13,323
return on your time starts to get worse and worse and worse.

556
00:22:14,063 --> 00:22:16,104
You decide when it's no longer worth it,

557
00:22:16,164 --> 00:22:18,205
and when you do, you exchange all of that progress

558
00:22:18,245 --> 00:22:20,606
you've given for that new meta-currency.

559
00:22:21,487 --> 00:22:23,288
That also shucks you back to the beginning

560
00:22:23,908 --> 00:22:26,029
of the progress bar, which as I mentioned before,

561
00:22:26,149 --> 00:22:27,550
tends to be that period where we get

562
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,971
much higher volume of stimulus.

563
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:30,191
It feels really good.

564
00:22:30,211 --> 00:22:32,332
I also want to point out that idle games

565
00:22:32,372 --> 00:22:34,614
have some of the best retention in the single-player market.

566
00:22:35,294 --> 00:22:36,294
It's a good example of how,

567
00:22:36,334 --> 00:22:38,255
when we actually give autonomy back to players,

568
00:22:38,275 --> 00:22:40,496
they reward us with their attention over time.

569
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:45,503
Okay, and progress is just one form of satisfaction.

570
00:22:46,284 --> 00:22:49,086
There's lots of different taxonomies of satisfaction,

571
00:22:49,186 --> 00:22:51,168
perma, ocean, self-determination theory,

572
00:22:51,508 --> 00:22:54,731
but progress is always a part of those theories.

573
00:22:55,192 --> 00:22:56,733
And the other part that's always consistent

574
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:58,034
is this idea of relatedness.

575
00:22:59,035 --> 00:23:01,897
So I wanna talk finally about communities over time.

576
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:05,801
Any game that has lasted for

577
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:10,251
more than a few years, has relied on

578
00:23:10,331 --> 00:23:12,692
either algorithmic content, like Solitaire,

579
00:23:14,272 --> 00:23:17,033
or social content, and whether that's a co-op game

580
00:23:17,073 --> 00:23:19,854
or an MMO or something as timeless as sports.

581
00:23:20,934 --> 00:23:22,755
The content, the stimulus, doesn't come

582
00:23:22,815 --> 00:23:24,835
from the basic systems, it comes from the fact

583
00:23:24,855 --> 00:23:26,336
that other people are using them.

584
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:29,556
Each individual in the world is this infinite well

585
00:23:29,596 --> 00:23:32,457
of potential content, and once you can harness that,

586
00:23:32,877 --> 00:23:35,478
you've got the ability to generate content forever.

587
00:23:35,938 --> 00:23:36,618
It's very exciting.

588
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:40,252
So how do we make relationships form?

589
00:23:41,413 --> 00:23:44,215
There was a great report out of Project Horseshoe this year

590
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:46,236
that broke down some of the fundamental pillars

591
00:23:46,537 --> 00:23:46,997
of friendship.

592
00:23:47,597 --> 00:23:48,638
I highly recommend that you read it.

593
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:52,401
It's based on some psychology studies from the 1950s

594
00:23:52,421 --> 00:23:54,222
that have held up over time, which is always exciting.

595
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:56,734
The first thing that you need is proximity.

596
00:23:56,774 --> 00:23:58,875
So this means people need to see each other frequently.

597
00:23:58,935 --> 00:24:00,696
So if you've got millions and millions of players,

598
00:24:00,716 --> 00:24:03,337
you need to find a way to shard or subsection

599
00:24:03,357 --> 00:24:04,917
your player set so that people encounter

600
00:24:04,957 --> 00:24:05,938
each other again and again.

601
00:24:06,338 --> 00:24:07,859
When people start to recognize each other,

602
00:24:07,899 --> 00:24:08,679
that builds affinity.

603
00:24:09,859 --> 00:24:10,940
The next thing is similarity.

604
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,361
So this means I need some form of self-expression

605
00:24:13,781 --> 00:24:15,041
that other people can relate to.

606
00:24:15,102 --> 00:24:17,462
This can be as simple as something like Team Mystic

607
00:24:17,502 --> 00:24:20,264
or Valorant Pokemon, and it goes all the way down

608
00:24:20,344 --> 00:24:23,765
to kind of complex badges and signaling tools and,

609
00:24:25,014 --> 00:24:25,774
user customization.

610
00:24:27,095 --> 00:24:28,377
The next thing is reciprocity.

611
00:24:28,457 --> 00:24:30,639
So we need to be able to form a symbiotic relationship,

612
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:32,400
which means I can do something for you,

613
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,441
you can do something for me.

614
00:24:33,501 --> 00:24:36,004
This doesn't need to be item exchanges.

615
00:24:36,044 --> 00:24:37,845
This is something as simple as a chat window.

616
00:24:38,346 --> 00:24:39,767
I don't know how excited you guys get

617
00:24:39,787 --> 00:24:41,088
when you're talking to someone that you love

618
00:24:41,128 --> 00:24:42,049
or respect and admire,

619
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:44,532
and you see the little dots in Gchat start to move.

620
00:24:44,752 --> 00:24:45,773
That's very exciting.

621
00:24:45,813 --> 00:24:47,554
That's a form of anticipation and stimulus.

622
00:24:48,575 --> 00:24:50,557
And then the final pillar is this idea of disclosure.

623
00:24:51,025 --> 00:24:53,606
which essentially means that I can take risks with you.

624
00:24:53,966 --> 00:24:55,726
I can express more of myself with you.

625
00:24:56,166 --> 00:24:57,427
And those are some of the underpinnings

626
00:24:57,447 --> 00:24:59,467
for things like trust and compassion and empathy,

627
00:24:59,827 --> 00:25:01,308
which should be familiar as things

628
00:25:01,348 --> 00:25:02,908
that create longer-term relationships.

629
00:25:04,568 --> 00:25:05,688
Now, before we can do any of those,

630
00:25:05,728 --> 00:25:06,889
we have to be able to communicate.

631
00:25:06,969 --> 00:25:08,749
Essentially, if people can't communicate

632
00:25:09,149 --> 00:25:10,670
their ideas and their feelings in your game,

633
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:13,710
they're not going to be able to build complex relationships.

634
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:16,111
It doesn't matter if this is private messages,

635
00:25:16,171 --> 00:25:17,491
message boards, chat rooms.

636
00:25:18,011 --> 00:25:19,992
The ability to communicate is a fundamental necessity.

637
00:25:20,836 --> 00:25:22,317
And if you can get that into your game,

638
00:25:23,098 --> 00:25:24,999
the less people are going to turn to outside services,

639
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,822
which means the more your game becomes less of an activity

640
00:25:27,862 --> 00:25:30,304
and more of a place to hang out, relax, and exist together.

641
00:25:31,785 --> 00:25:33,426
Once you've got that underlying foundation,

642
00:25:33,466 --> 00:25:35,147
you can start to look for signs of societies,

643
00:25:35,188 --> 00:25:36,929
and it turns out they look a lot like real life.

644
00:25:36,989 --> 00:25:39,431
You have social activities, cultural activities,

645
00:25:39,511 --> 00:25:41,012
economic activities.

646
00:25:41,493 --> 00:25:43,154
And the great news is that you don't need to build

647
00:25:43,194 --> 00:25:45,416
incredibly complex systems in order to evoke

648
00:25:45,476 --> 00:25:47,177
some of these social behaviors.

649
00:25:48,272 --> 00:25:51,374
We as social creatures inherently tend to produce these

650
00:25:51,574 --> 00:25:52,815
even with basic systems.

651
00:25:53,435 --> 00:25:55,177
As soon as you have a power curve, for instance,

652
00:25:55,197 --> 00:25:57,639
you can start getting different political elements.

653
00:25:58,079 --> 00:25:59,300
If I am more powerful than you,

654
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,381
I can exert some sort of will or force.

655
00:26:01,461 --> 00:26:02,202
I can lead you.

656
00:26:03,723 --> 00:26:05,184
As soon as you get public spaces

657
00:26:05,244 --> 00:26:06,665
and the ability for self-expression,

658
00:26:06,705 --> 00:26:09,768
you start getting cultural elements, aesthetics, fashions.

659
00:26:10,288 --> 00:26:12,309
If people can proclaim things in chat,

660
00:26:12,329 --> 00:26:14,211
you start getting morality and belief systems.

661
00:26:15,589 --> 00:26:16,910
As soon as you have item exchange,

662
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:18,050
you start getting economies.

663
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:19,951
You can do charity, banking, investment.

664
00:26:21,252 --> 00:26:23,833
And as soon as you have some form of player customization,

665
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:25,694
you start getting things like group identities,

666
00:26:25,794 --> 00:26:27,936
specializations, celebrities that you recognize.

667
00:26:28,776 --> 00:26:30,357
And these are all really, really cool things.

668
00:26:31,477 --> 00:26:32,798
But what's that kind of through line?

669
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,499
If we look at player customization,

670
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:38,061
and I hope that it's bright enough here,

671
00:26:39,161 --> 00:26:41,102
what this guild has done is they've all worn

672
00:26:41,403 --> 00:26:44,144
a black tabard with some yellow pixels on it.

673
00:26:45,623 --> 00:26:47,585
But those aren't just yellow pixels for this group.

674
00:26:49,006 --> 00:26:51,368
Those yellow pixels imply a shared history,

675
00:26:51,889 --> 00:26:55,351
a shared set of values, shared trust and understanding.

676
00:26:56,732 --> 00:26:58,354
Those yellow pixels have meaning.

677
00:26:59,955 --> 00:27:02,157
Meaning means that an item has greater value or greater

678
00:27:02,217 --> 00:27:04,399
importance than what the raw materials imply.

679
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:08,202
Meaning is psychological value, not physical value,

680
00:27:08,362 --> 00:27:11,805
in the same way that attention is our psychological energy

681
00:27:11,925 --> 00:27:13,226
as opposed to our physical energy.

682
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:17,950
So to create meaning, players must invest time

683
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:19,030
and attention into something.

684
00:27:19,591 --> 00:27:20,811
And if they do that together,

685
00:27:21,151 --> 00:27:22,871
it works as a sort of multiplier.

686
00:27:23,251 --> 00:27:24,752
That's why we have religion

687
00:27:24,872 --> 00:27:26,892
and why we love our countries, sometimes.

688
00:27:27,892 --> 00:27:29,092
And so if we want attention,

689
00:27:29,172 --> 00:27:31,373
one of the best and healthiest ways that we can get it

690
00:27:31,793 --> 00:27:34,373
is to enable social structures that generate meaning.

691
00:27:35,294 --> 00:27:37,474
This creates this beautiful upward spiral.

692
00:27:37,874 --> 00:27:40,635
Meaning begets attention, which generates more meaning.

693
00:27:41,871 --> 00:27:43,332
And once you have that escalation,

694
00:27:43,732 --> 00:27:45,673
you have the best underlying foundation

695
00:27:45,773 --> 00:27:47,674
for increased engagement over time.

696
00:27:48,815 --> 00:27:49,896
Meaning enriches life.

697
00:27:49,956 --> 00:27:51,597
It's this innate human need.

698
00:27:52,077 --> 00:27:53,438
And the more we can facilitate it,

699
00:27:54,438 --> 00:27:56,139
the longer our product is going to last.

700
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,661
This is the reason that Facebook is still going.

701
00:27:58,761 --> 00:27:59,881
We fill it with meaning.

702
00:27:59,941 --> 00:28:01,722
We fill it with our friends and our photographs,

703
00:28:01,762 --> 00:28:02,483
our idle chatter.

704
00:28:02,983 --> 00:28:04,684
We fill it with memories and little anecdotes.

705
00:28:04,904 --> 00:28:05,825
We fill it with meaning,

706
00:28:05,845 --> 00:28:07,646
and that investment is very hard to leave behind.

707
00:28:10,299 --> 00:28:11,820
When we give something our time and attention,

708
00:28:12,761 --> 00:28:14,823
when we create meaning together with someone,

709
00:28:15,503 --> 00:28:17,405
and when we're treated with respect and love in return,

710
00:28:18,105 --> 00:28:20,767
that's the true recipe for long-term relationships.

711
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:22,889
So please be good.

712
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:25,171
Earn the attention of your players.

713
00:28:25,591 --> 00:28:26,452
Don't demand it.

714
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:28,453
Be trustworthy.

715
00:28:28,593 --> 00:28:31,015
Communicate clearly and transparently with your players.

716
00:28:31,495 --> 00:28:33,097
Find a balance in the relationship

717
00:28:33,137 --> 00:28:34,158
that works for both of you.

718
00:28:35,358 --> 00:28:36,139
Be farsighted.

719
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,120
Don't follow these short-term spikes,

720
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:41,301
and don't believe in the long-term success

721
00:28:41,341 --> 00:28:43,042
of malicious interaction patterns.

722
00:28:43,642 --> 00:28:45,403
Plan a journey that's going to last for years.

723
00:28:46,263 --> 00:28:47,803
And for the love of God, please do better.

724
00:28:48,924 --> 00:28:50,564
As we design games that can last for years,

725
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:52,225
we need to migrate from being storytellers

726
00:28:52,265 --> 00:28:55,006
and content creators into engineers of new societies.

727
00:28:55,486 --> 00:28:57,047
Societies where people trust each other,

728
00:28:57,147 --> 00:29:00,068
or at least know the risks of wandering into wild territory.

729
00:29:01,288 --> 00:29:02,688
Societies where people can play together

730
00:29:02,728 --> 00:29:04,269
and challenge each other and unite together

731
00:29:04,329 --> 00:29:06,070
to form these complex social structures.

732
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,001
We need to be architects, city planners, psychologists,

733
00:29:09,021 --> 00:29:09,861
and anthropologists.

734
00:29:10,222 --> 00:29:11,502
And we need to look towards the horizon

735
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:12,603
instead of staring at our feet.

736
00:29:13,484 --> 00:29:14,944
We live in an engagement economy,

737
00:29:14,984 --> 00:29:16,125
whether we like that or not.

738
00:29:16,525 --> 00:29:17,866
Attention is our coin.

739
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,127
So please be mindful of where you spend yours

740
00:29:20,187 --> 00:29:21,348
and what you're incentivizing.

741
00:29:21,928 --> 00:29:23,329
When you spend your attention, you

742
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:24,950
are literally paying attention.

743
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:27,572
And people are going to use that value that they get from you.

744
00:29:29,192 --> 00:29:30,973
And please be honorable to those that you

745
00:29:31,053 --> 00:29:31,934
ask for their attention.

746
00:29:32,875 --> 00:29:35,336
Our society right now is a reflection of the systems

747
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:36,116
that we've created.

748
00:29:37,552 --> 00:29:39,277
So go and create systems that are better.

749
00:29:39,979 --> 00:29:42,345
Create systems that are going to help our world thrive,

750
00:29:42,967 --> 00:29:44,592
not just right now, but over time.

751
00:29:45,434 --> 00:29:45,634
Thank you.
