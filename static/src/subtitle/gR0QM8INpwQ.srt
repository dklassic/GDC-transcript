Hi, my name is Steven Dickinson and I'm a Senior Technical Animator at The Coalition.

2
00:00:08,957 --> 00:00:14,478
On Gears of War 4, we developed a generalized solution to meet the spatial constraints of

3
00:00:14,478 --> 00:00:18,818
an uneven and dynamic environment which was also expanded into our cover, execution, and

4
00:00:18,818 --> 00:00:20,499
enemy interaction system.

5
00:00:20,499 --> 00:00:24,379
Are you an animator or programmer looking to reduce animation assets while increasing

6
00:00:24,379 --> 00:00:26,740
visual fidelity, coverage, and flexibility?

7
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:31,541
If so, you should attend my presentation, Motion Warping in Gears of War 4, Doing More

00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:31,961
With Less.
