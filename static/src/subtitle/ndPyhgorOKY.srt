1
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:06,871
All right, we're live.

2
00:00:07,551 --> 00:00:08,292
Welcome, everyone.

3
00:00:09,432 --> 00:00:10,373
My name is Linda Fane,

4
00:00:10,513 --> 00:00:13,134
and I'm the senior agility coach at Bungie.

5
00:00:14,295 --> 00:00:21,579
So I've spent my whole career helping teams

6
00:00:21,639 --> 00:00:23,700
of creative people collaborate more effectively,

7
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,122
and had the opportunity in the last two years

8
00:00:27,802 --> 00:00:30,483
to help Bungie transform their ways of working

9
00:00:30,623 --> 00:00:33,965
to agile and lean methodologies.

10
00:00:34,871 --> 00:00:38,654
So I'm essentially an agile coach, but I'm internal to Bungie.

11
00:00:39,595 --> 00:00:42,858
So I'm here today because I wanted to share with you what's been really a powerful,

12
00:00:43,319 --> 00:00:47,482
yet simple practice that we've experimented with at Bungie

13
00:00:48,063 --> 00:00:51,165
that's enabled us to achieve the level of synchronization

14
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:56,010
that we need to make such a massive, unified game at scale like Destiny 2.

15
00:00:57,351 --> 00:00:59,313
I've nicknamed it Epic Sync.

16
00:01:00,606 --> 00:01:04,687
because Bungie's Destiny 2 syncs can be epic,

17
00:01:04,847 --> 00:01:07,488
because Destiny 2 is epic.

18
00:01:08,248 --> 00:01:09,928
But I'm hoping that you'll find the concepts

19
00:01:09,988 --> 00:01:11,129
and approaches useful,

20
00:01:11,829 --> 00:01:13,829
no matter what size your studio may be,

21
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:16,490
or what level of synchronization you want to achieve

22
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,651
with teams working in parallel.

23
00:01:19,971 --> 00:01:21,712
So show of hands, how many of you attended

24
00:01:21,772 --> 00:01:24,092
Patrick Kelly's talk on Wednesday

25
00:01:24,152 --> 00:01:27,093
on Bungie's transforming their methodologies?

26
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,033
Excellent, about 50% or so.

27
00:01:30,265 --> 00:01:34,806
I'm going to recap a couple of items from that and then pick the story up from there.

28
00:01:38,948 --> 00:01:44,209
So throughout his 20 plus year history, Bungie's had a process for making games that was successful

29
00:01:44,249 --> 00:01:47,670
and served us very well, served our players very well.

30
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:54,892
We started with a typical smaller studio model with our work organized primarily around disciplines.

31
00:01:57,002 --> 00:02:00,343
So art, animation, design, engineering, test,

32
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:04,366
with a producer organizing their work,

33
00:02:04,426 --> 00:02:06,807
managing the handoffs between the disciplines

34
00:02:07,647 --> 00:02:11,369
in a fairly traditional waterfall workflow.

35
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,111
So we carried this structure through from the Halo days

36
00:02:15,171 --> 00:02:17,072
into the original Destiny development.

37
00:02:17,893 --> 00:02:20,234
As one of our producers said in a post-mortem,

38
00:02:21,695 --> 00:02:23,676
right when the original Destiny was shipping,

39
00:02:23,696 --> 00:02:26,177
it said that the hardest thing to do

40
00:02:27,018 --> 00:02:29,499
at Bungie was anything cross-disciplinary.

41
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:32,821
Well, that wasn't great because many of the rich,

42
00:02:33,161 --> 00:02:35,722
integrated experiences in Destiny involved work

43
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:38,804
produced by multiple specialty disciplines.

44
00:02:40,805 --> 00:02:44,406
So to meet this challenge of more tightly integrating

45
00:02:44,446 --> 00:02:48,028
disciplinary work for Destiny 2, we

46
00:02:48,108 --> 00:02:51,049
started conducting early experiments

47
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,951
with integrated small teams.

48
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,851
So this is our icon for small teams,

49
00:02:57,892 --> 00:03:01,594
and you'll notice the disciplines are all in the team unit.

50
00:03:03,095 --> 00:03:05,436
So Bungie reorganized the content developers

51
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:08,558
into small teams following the Agile Scrum model.

52
00:03:09,339 --> 00:03:11,800
These teams were designed with the characteristics,

53
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,441
they were cross-discipline,

54
00:03:13,881 --> 00:03:16,763
so you had level designers, engineers, world artists,

55
00:03:16,843 --> 00:03:20,946
tests, working in close-knit unit, physically co-located,

56
00:03:21,506 --> 00:03:23,407
attending daily stand-ups, et cetera.

57
00:03:26,226 --> 00:03:32,151
Typically seven to nine team members, that's a sweet spot for managing collaboration and

58
00:03:32,191 --> 00:03:32,992
communication.

59
00:03:33,352 --> 00:03:40,097
When you get beyond about ten people, the communication becomes, the overhead starts

60
00:03:40,618 --> 00:03:43,180
not having value, becomes unwieldy.

61
00:03:44,761 --> 00:03:48,264
So the teams had a clear mission and focus.

62
00:03:49,345 --> 00:03:50,586
Even a unique identity.

63
00:03:50,766 --> 00:03:54,009
For the first time we had cross-discipline teams that had a unique identity.

64
00:03:55,505 --> 00:03:58,587
They were semi-autonomous, and I say semi-autonomous,

65
00:03:58,667 --> 00:04:00,487
some localized decision making

66
00:04:01,027 --> 00:04:02,688
within appropriate constraints.

67
00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:07,630
As Connor Crawley said in his talk yesterday on change,

68
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,891
on managing change, he said,

69
00:04:09,911 --> 00:04:13,352
he called team autonomy freedom in a box,

70
00:04:14,453 --> 00:04:16,353
or freedom in a frame, I think he called it,

71
00:04:16,413 --> 00:04:18,494
which is a really good way to look at it

72
00:04:18,514 --> 00:04:21,415
because people think, ah, autonomous teams,

73
00:04:21,435 --> 00:04:22,956
we're just gonna have people running amok.

74
00:04:23,588 --> 00:04:26,050
But no, you can allow autonomy or freedom.

75
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:29,612
You can release the teams into clear constraints.

76
00:04:32,374 --> 00:04:35,675
So then we also focused on creating holistic player

77
00:04:35,755 --> 00:04:38,617
experiences so the individuals weren't focused just

78
00:04:38,697 --> 00:04:41,199
on their individual discipline contribution.

79
00:04:41,619 --> 00:04:44,621
They were actually now focused on a unified player experience

80
00:04:45,001 --> 00:04:47,222
and actually wrote the requirements

81
00:04:47,502 --> 00:04:50,304
from the perspective of the player in the user story

82
00:04:50,424 --> 00:04:51,765
format that's known in Agile.

83
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:58,795
So we were achieving close collaboration amongst people of different disciplines, breaking

84
00:04:58,835 --> 00:04:59,776
down silos.

85
00:05:00,496 --> 00:05:06,198
This provided visibility into an understanding of each other's workflows and unique challenges.

86
00:05:07,498 --> 00:05:13,841
So an artist gets to know what a designer's workflow is, and it develops trust, empathy,

87
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:15,701
and they share common goals.

88
00:05:16,181 --> 00:05:21,083
So cross-discipline teamwork is where the real magic happens for creative teams, in

89
00:05:21,103 --> 00:05:21,863
my experience.

90
00:05:25,938 --> 00:05:29,521
All right, so here we are now making the massive unified

91
00:05:29,601 --> 00:05:32,663
experience that is Destiny 2 with roughly 40 plus

92
00:05:32,843 --> 00:05:37,326
of these newly formed small cross-discipline teams.

93
00:05:38,407 --> 00:05:40,708
The next challenge we took up was

94
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:44,470
how to best synchronize these semi-autonomous units.

95
00:05:46,692 --> 00:05:47,352
You can imagine.

96
00:05:47,372 --> 00:05:48,533
I made it.

97
00:05:48,553 --> 00:05:49,614
It looks like a mess.

98
00:05:50,334 --> 00:05:52,676
We've got all of these small teams who are really focused.

99
00:05:52,956 --> 00:05:53,796
They know who they are.

100
00:05:53,856 --> 00:05:54,897
They know what they're doing.

101
00:05:55,642 --> 00:05:59,063
but they're all producing work that goes into a unified game.

102
00:06:00,183 --> 00:06:04,204
So I wanted to illustrate the sheer scale of Destiny 2 team

103
00:06:04,244 --> 00:06:08,466
collaboration by showing you different moments in Destiny

104
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:11,126
and allow you to see some of the teams that

105
00:06:11,186 --> 00:06:12,127
touch these moments.

106
00:06:15,088 --> 00:06:17,548
So for some of you that are familiar with the game,

107
00:06:17,568 --> 00:06:19,709
this is the PVP, the crucible.

108
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,602
So we have a PVP team, PVP maps, weapons, armor, lighting, VFX.

109
00:06:25,782 --> 00:06:28,244
Those are all small teams of seven to nine people,

110
00:06:28,744 --> 00:06:32,626
then collaborating with, in this case, eight other teams.

111
00:06:34,247 --> 00:06:35,347
Destiny's environments.

112
00:06:36,268 --> 00:06:39,230
We have a massive playable area spanning several planets,

113
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,071
each with their own art palettes.

114
00:06:41,911 --> 00:06:44,492
We have concept art palettes, skies, et cetera.

115
00:06:46,454 --> 00:06:47,114
Public events.

116
00:06:48,811 --> 00:06:51,793
So you can meet players, tackle shared challenges,

117
00:06:52,393 --> 00:06:55,215
and you'll recognize the spider tank boss on Titan.

118
00:06:55,736 --> 00:06:58,358
So we have the abilities team, audio, progression, economy,

119
00:06:58,618 --> 00:06:59,058
et cetera.

120
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:02,701
The director, the underlying destination maps,

121
00:07:02,741 --> 00:07:05,122
allows players to explore the solar system.

122
00:07:09,626 --> 00:07:12,027
Complex social systems in Destiny 2,

123
00:07:12,648 --> 00:07:16,190
including matchmaking, clans, guided games, social spaces

124
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,831
like this, you'll recognize the farm.

125
00:07:21,465 --> 00:07:24,025
And then character vignettes, cinematic sequences.

126
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:26,306
This one featuring my favorite character, Hawthorne.

127
00:07:30,907 --> 00:07:32,107
So we achieved the benefits.

128
00:07:32,147 --> 00:07:35,248
Here we go back to, wow, you see all these teams.

129
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:39,069
You saw what we're producing and how integrated

130
00:07:39,769 --> 00:07:41,149
the world of Destiny 2 is.

131
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:43,050
So we needed a team structure that

132
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:45,790
was as integrated as the world we were creating.

133
00:07:47,253 --> 00:07:51,114
So we achieve the benefit of focus and of cross-discipline,

134
00:07:52,155 --> 00:07:53,855
tight-knit units.

135
00:07:54,936 --> 00:07:58,017
So those units, then, working in parallel,

136
00:07:59,417 --> 00:08:02,459
are driving a complex web of interdependencies

137
00:08:02,579 --> 00:08:03,499
between teams.

138
00:08:04,539 --> 00:08:07,260
Some of you might recognize this in your own work.

139
00:08:08,141 --> 00:08:10,442
The red lines represent the dependencies.

140
00:08:10,462 --> 00:08:13,363
Just keep building, building, building into a web,

141
00:08:14,103 --> 00:08:15,223
web of dependencies.

142
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:21,584
So it's a little jargony, but dependency is work that your team requires from another

143
00:08:21,644 --> 00:08:23,725
team in order to complete your features.

144
00:08:24,806 --> 00:08:28,068
It's normally hidden work, hard to track.

145
00:08:28,088 --> 00:08:32,830
Sometimes you just might have a stomachache and you're just thinking, oh, there's something

146
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,171
we need from some other team.

147
00:08:34,211 --> 00:08:38,293
I don't know what it is, but I don't feel like we can complete our work.

148
00:08:39,694 --> 00:08:45,997
So dependency is a thing that calls out when you are dependent upon another team.

149
00:08:47,417 --> 00:08:50,379
Textbook agile scrum teams don't have dependencies,

150
00:08:51,119 --> 00:08:57,802
but unified experience teams building experiences at scale like Destiny do.

151
00:08:57,822 --> 00:09:00,763
So it can be overwhelming. How do you sort this out?

152
00:09:03,365 --> 00:09:05,886
So how to synchronize these team units with each other?

153
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,947
How do you provide the measure of autonomy?

154
00:09:10,381 --> 00:09:14,183
and maintain continual alignment while managing these dependencies.

155
00:09:15,143 --> 00:09:17,164
So how we do it is what I'm going to share with you today.

156
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:20,785
First, why is alignment so important?

157
00:09:24,187 --> 00:09:28,048
So this is a cartoon by Henrik Nyberg, one of my favorite agilists.

158
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:31,029
Why is alignment important?

159
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,131
Would you say it's not funny?

160
00:09:37,012 --> 00:09:37,692
Yeah, I know.

161
00:09:37,712 --> 00:09:39,413
You just feel, oh gosh.

162
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:43,062
So in this, like in any large scale human endeavor,

163
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,964
you have teams working in parallel.

164
00:09:46,444 --> 00:09:47,605
Alignment is key.

165
00:09:49,026 --> 00:09:52,329
In this example, you have two teams working autonomously.

166
00:09:52,349 --> 00:09:55,411
And it's clear they understood the end goal, right?

167
00:09:55,451 --> 00:09:58,373
They needed to cross the expanse of water.

168
00:09:58,853 --> 00:09:59,854
So they had that end goal.

169
00:09:59,894 --> 00:10:01,495
Like they started out maybe in a huddle.

170
00:10:01,575 --> 00:10:03,917
Hey, guys, we're going to cross this expanse.

171
00:10:03,997 --> 00:10:05,138
Yeah, we know what to do.

172
00:10:06,722 --> 00:10:11,863
So they started out to achieve their goal, but they clearly lacked some sort of regular

173
00:10:11,923 --> 00:10:14,324
communication or coordination to stay aligned.

174
00:10:15,264 --> 00:10:17,285
Also dependency management.

175
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:20,686
So the teams working in parallel had a huge dependency, right?

176
00:10:21,126 --> 00:10:23,207
They needed to connect or hook up.

177
00:10:24,407 --> 00:10:27,948
But that dependency was clearly not identified or managed.

178
00:10:31,049 --> 00:10:34,590
Famous example of a lack of alignment causing problems.

179
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:35,770
Do you know what this is?

180
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:41,201
It's the Mars Orbiter in 1999.

181
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:46,463
So NASA lost $125 million Mars Orbiter.

182
00:10:47,483 --> 00:10:49,784
And the core problem was that Lockheed Martin,

183
00:10:50,304 --> 00:10:54,826
the engineering team that was building the software used,

184
00:10:56,826 --> 00:10:59,547
building the thruster software for the orbiter,

185
00:11:00,488 --> 00:11:02,968
used imperial English units of measurement.

186
00:11:03,802 --> 00:11:08,064
Well, the agency's team, building the software system,

187
00:11:08,104 --> 00:11:09,964
taking in the information, actually

188
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,665
used the metric system of measurement.

189
00:11:12,545 --> 00:11:16,126
This caused the orbiter to lose navigation

190
00:11:16,186 --> 00:11:17,886
and actually crash into the planet.

191
00:11:19,227 --> 00:11:20,767
So they finally got there.

192
00:11:20,867 --> 00:11:22,028
It went all the way to Mars.

193
00:11:22,108 --> 00:11:22,728
It finally got there.

194
00:11:22,768 --> 00:11:23,688
They were going to celebrate.

195
00:11:24,128 --> 00:11:25,469
And then all of a sudden, it couldn't move,

196
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:27,349
and it just went down and then crashed.

197
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:32,291
They investigated and quickly found the misalignment.

198
00:11:33,114 --> 00:11:35,835
And that misalignment had existed for nearly 10 months,

199
00:11:36,435 --> 00:11:37,735
yet it had gone undetected.

200
00:11:38,455 --> 00:11:40,496
They didn't realize that they were using different systems

201
00:11:40,536 --> 00:11:40,976
of measurement.

202
00:11:41,356 --> 00:11:44,377
So the main point, teams of very smart people

203
00:11:44,457 --> 00:11:46,897
can get out of alignment and cause problems.

204
00:11:50,218 --> 00:11:52,798
So it's important to understand that when we have semi-autonomous

205
00:11:52,838 --> 00:11:54,939
team units working in parallel, there's

206
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:59,600
a natural drift that occurs as time progresses.

207
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,040
So I did this animation to.

208
00:12:02,652 --> 00:12:08,973
illustrate you have small divergences in understanding about scope or areas of responsibility that

209
00:12:08,993 --> 00:12:11,354
become wider as development goes on.

210
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:19,156
If teams get more and more out of alignment, after a certain point, there's no one individual

211
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:20,637
team has the power to correct it.

212
00:12:20,837 --> 00:12:24,058
They could maybe even see it coming and they just can't do anything.

213
00:12:25,938 --> 00:12:30,019
At Bungie, Patrick, the head of production for Destiny 2, would use the analogy of a

214
00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:31,300
fleet of sailboats.

215
00:12:32,324 --> 00:12:37,585
The teams were like fleets of sailboats, an armada, all heading to the same point.

216
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:40,766
We just needed to coordinate them.

217
00:12:41,606 --> 00:12:48,987
So with our new structure, 40 plus small teams developing in parallel on Destiny 2, we asked

218
00:12:49,027 --> 00:12:53,348
ourselves what could we do to ensure that we stay in alignment, in sync.

219
00:12:55,009 --> 00:12:59,610
So to search for answers, I went back to the fundamental Agile values and principles.

220
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:04,503
So another show of hands, how many of you are familiar with Agile values and principles?

221
00:13:05,884 --> 00:13:07,205
Quite a few, about three quarters.

222
00:13:08,346 --> 00:13:13,049
Yeah, we, you know, there's a lot of wisdom there.

223
00:13:13,089 --> 00:13:18,313
There's four values, twelve principles, and some of them you scan over and go,

224
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:19,434
oh, that doesn't apply to me.

225
00:13:19,474 --> 00:13:21,316
But you look in there, there's some real nuggets.

226
00:13:22,417 --> 00:13:25,619
So I went back to the values and principles to see, you know,

227
00:13:25,659 --> 00:13:30,123
is there something in there that could help me with this issue that we were trying to solve for?

228
00:13:31,313 --> 00:13:36,595
So the first value from the Agile manifesto is people and interactions over process and

229
00:13:36,675 --> 00:13:37,075
tools.

230
00:13:38,155 --> 00:13:42,377
So it's not saying process and tools isn't important, it's just that it's not a replacement

231
00:13:42,417 --> 00:13:46,938
for high quality human communication and interaction, collaboration.

232
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:56,702
You add to that the Agile, sixth Agile principle, which is face-to-face conversations are the

233
00:13:56,742 --> 00:13:59,363
most efficient, effective means for communicating.

234
00:14:01,016 --> 00:14:05,360
Research shows that 93% of communication effectiveness

235
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,641
is actually determined by nonverbal cues.

236
00:14:08,262 --> 00:14:11,825
So body language, facial expressions, tone, inflection.

237
00:14:11,845 --> 00:14:14,327
It contains a ton of information.

238
00:14:15,908 --> 00:14:21,153
Furthermore, face-to-face communication is found to be the most efficient.

239
00:14:21,173 --> 00:14:24,315
You can achieve maximum productivity with minimum wasted effort.

240
00:14:25,856 --> 00:14:28,819
In this digital age, we think that asynchronous,

241
00:14:29,099 --> 00:14:30,600
indirect communication like...

242
00:14:31,021 --> 00:14:37,945
group emails or shared documents up on a share where people contribute asynchronously.

243
00:14:38,566 --> 00:14:40,647
We think that's more efficient.

244
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:45,150
It's a more efficient way to communicate with groups of people.

245
00:14:47,412 --> 00:14:50,033
We think it's more efficient because it feels more efficient.

246
00:14:50,153 --> 00:14:54,376
You know, you add a bunch of people to the CC line and hit send.

247
00:14:54,876 --> 00:14:56,718
There, we communicated.

248
00:14:58,789 --> 00:15:03,552
But if you really look at it, it's not high quality communication.

249
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:07,715
Communication is a sender and receiver, so you need to, you have something you want to

250
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:15,221
say and you have to get, the receiver has to actually receive it, and face-to-face communication

251
00:15:15,261 --> 00:15:21,065
is the best way to actually have communication work.

252
00:15:21,105 --> 00:15:25,348
Face-to-face communication with all its social cues has also been proven to deepen understanding

253
00:15:25,408 --> 00:15:26,008
and empathy.

254
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:28,858
and help develop trust.

255
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:33,798
So empathy, trust, collective understanding,

256
00:15:33,818 --> 00:15:36,419
those all have been proven to speed up the work of teams.

257
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:40,059
In addition to the values and principles,

258
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:47,121
I also looked at the agile practices

259
00:15:47,341 --> 00:15:48,861
of rituals and ceremonies.

260
00:15:50,681 --> 00:15:55,622
So in agile, we have rituals or ceremonies, a cadence.

261
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:57,799
of team collaboration.

262
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:05,543
Agile teams use rituals to keep synchronized within the team on a daily basis, so you might

263
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:12,707
have daily stand-up, the demo review, you've got backlog grooming, team retrospective.

264
00:16:13,007 --> 00:16:13,928
It's all built in.

265
00:16:13,948 --> 00:16:19,371
You have a plan, do, check, and act, plan, do, check, act.

266
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:21,872
You've got this ritual cadence.

267
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:26,233
So I'm familiar with those, the Agile Scrum rituals,

268
00:16:26,293 --> 00:16:28,074
but those were actually to help teams

269
00:16:28,394 --> 00:16:30,095
stay aligned within themselves.

270
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:33,116
You know, was there a ritual that could help

271
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:38,978
create a situation where teams can align cross-team,

272
00:16:39,338 --> 00:16:41,639
not just within themselves, but with other teams?

273
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,481
So could these concepts, the values and principles,

274
00:16:46,621 --> 00:16:49,022
rituals and cadence, you know,

275
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:50,963
could these concepts hold the key

276
00:16:51,003 --> 00:16:53,184
to synchronizing 40-plus teams on Destiny 2?

277
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:02,724
So I did this calculation, face-to-face communication plus regular ritual plus many teams equals

278
00:17:02,764 --> 00:17:02,985
what?

279
00:17:05,246 --> 00:17:07,188
You know, was there an Agile ritual?

280
00:17:07,268 --> 00:17:13,654
So to look for the answer, we explored the frameworks that were emerging that applied

281
00:17:13,894 --> 00:17:20,459
Agile and Scrum concepts at scale, like the Scaled Agile Framework.

282
00:17:22,721 --> 00:17:24,543
Scaled Agile Framework is known as SAFE.

283
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,903
If you want to go to the website, Scaled Agile Framework, it's an incredibly overwhelming

284
00:17:30,684 --> 00:17:32,725
enterprise solution for Agile.

285
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:34,806
Very kind of scary and overwhelming.

286
00:17:36,207 --> 00:17:42,052
So I just consulted that and started to see how it might apply to Bungie.

287
00:17:42,552 --> 00:17:50,057
So essentially, briefly, it looks at Agile practices in three levels of your organization.

288
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:54,080
So you have the team layer, the program layer.

289
00:17:55,209 --> 00:17:56,849
and the portfolio layer.

290
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:02,570
So this is converted for Bungie's purposes.

291
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:05,391
Team layer, program layer would be an area or a feature

292
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:06,271
in the game.

293
00:18:06,331 --> 00:18:08,892
Destiny franchise would be the actual release.

294
00:18:10,512 --> 00:18:14,033
So at the team layer, scrum teams are the atom.

295
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:17,273
They work for the most part in two-week increments,

296
00:18:17,373 --> 00:18:19,334
sprints, and deliver user stories.

297
00:18:20,314 --> 00:18:22,134
The first generation scrum cannon

298
00:18:23,308 --> 00:18:25,950
focused almost exclusively on this layer,

299
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:29,233
describing the practices, roles, rituals, exhaustive literature.

300
00:18:29,253 --> 00:18:30,554
You just, you know, look up Scrum,

301
00:18:30,574 --> 00:18:33,297
you'll see a lot of information about this team layer.

302
00:18:34,878 --> 00:18:36,499
It has time box iterations,

303
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,581
we use at Bungie two-week increments.

304
00:18:39,742 --> 00:18:42,264
But what I was really interested in is in the program layer.

305
00:18:43,325 --> 00:18:45,447
So I asked some SAFe experts, I said,

306
00:18:45,507 --> 00:18:47,689
is there, you know, is there a ritual in SAFe

307
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:49,651
that helps synchronize teams at that layer?

308
00:18:50,611 --> 00:18:51,412
Sure enough, there was.

309
00:18:52,651 --> 00:18:56,952
It was called Program Increment Planning, or PI planning.

310
00:18:58,192 --> 00:19:00,012
So bear with me, it's a little jargony,

311
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:03,573
PI planning, Program Increment Planning.

312
00:19:03,633 --> 00:19:06,293
So what is a program increment?

313
00:19:06,933 --> 00:19:09,594
It's a collection of work that is the output of many teams.

314
00:19:10,434 --> 00:19:12,754
It has a time box iteration like a sprint,

315
00:19:13,635 --> 00:19:15,755
but the time box is in 12 weeks,

316
00:19:16,475 --> 00:19:18,555
or what would be six sprints.

317
00:19:19,136 --> 00:19:19,896
So it's typically.

318
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:27,251
There was, so the PI planning ritual brings teams together in one place,

319
00:19:27,731 --> 00:19:30,952
one time to roughly plan a quarter's worth of work together

320
00:19:30,972 --> 00:19:34,332
and identify and resolve interdependencies.

321
00:19:35,653 --> 00:19:39,674
So the collection of quarterly scope in SAFE is called a release train.

322
00:19:41,634 --> 00:19:44,475
So we have the program increment planning happens at the beginning of

323
00:19:44,495 --> 00:19:47,736
the quarter. The quarterly release train, think about

324
00:19:47,776 --> 00:19:50,417
it as a container, like use the analogy of a train.

325
00:19:50,877 --> 00:19:52,837
It's a container like a train car.

326
00:19:53,711 --> 00:19:56,272
of work for that quarter.

327
00:19:56,292 --> 00:19:58,013
You put stuff onto the train car,

328
00:19:58,613 --> 00:20:02,796
and it's planned in that big room PI planning exercise.

329
00:20:03,096 --> 00:20:04,977
And then like a train, it leaves the station

330
00:20:04,997 --> 00:20:06,637
to get developed over six sprints

331
00:20:06,698 --> 00:20:09,739
until it pulls into the next station 12 weeks later.

332
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:12,981
So PI planning then is a process of determining

333
00:20:13,001 --> 00:20:15,102
what do you want to put on the next train that's leaving?

334
00:20:16,102 --> 00:20:18,023
You can think, what is the most important feature

335
00:20:18,363 --> 00:20:19,704
that we need to learn from this quarter?

336
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:24,493
You know, are there features that contain a high amount of uncertainty that we need to reduce?

337
00:20:25,193 --> 00:20:26,914
What are some of the big bets we want to prove out?

338
00:20:27,334 --> 00:20:31,757
Let's put it on the train, get it done, pull it in the station, and then we'll reassess.

339
00:20:33,338 --> 00:20:37,540
So PI planning, I had a name for it, but how does one do PI planning?

340
00:20:40,141 --> 00:20:41,062
I wanted to know more.

341
00:20:42,883 --> 00:20:45,424
So I stumbled onto a case study by Henrik Nyberg,

342
00:20:45,484 --> 00:20:48,186
who's an influential agilist and agile thought leader.

343
00:20:48,765 --> 00:20:53,528
who has a really playful, accessible approach to scaled agile,

344
00:20:53,568 --> 00:20:55,409
which you need because it can be pretty daunting.

345
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:59,672
He's worked with both Spotify and Lego,

346
00:20:59,712 --> 00:21:02,234
and you can go online, I see YouTube videos.

347
00:21:02,274 --> 00:21:07,197
He'll walk you through some of the scaled agile rituals

348
00:21:07,217 --> 00:21:09,058
that he has experimented with.

349
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:12,100
So I took the case study for Lego.

350
00:21:14,204 --> 00:21:18,747
I was like, literally I took the case study, I got the YouTube video and I transcribed

351
00:21:18,847 --> 00:21:23,870
it and put it into a document and worked with Bungee production.

352
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:26,791
We looked through it and we figured out how could this work for us?

353
00:21:27,272 --> 00:21:30,313
How could we do PI planning or big room planning?

354
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:37,477
So we used it as a template for starting PI planning at Bungee.

355
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,540
This concept of...

356
00:21:42,993 --> 00:21:46,075
quarterly big room planning exercise, an epic sink.

357
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:48,937
What could this get us?

358
00:21:48,997 --> 00:21:51,738
We had to weigh the cost-benefit.

359
00:21:53,219 --> 00:21:56,581
So instead of drift over quarter,

360
00:21:57,541 --> 00:22:00,003
we would tightly sink every 12 weeks.

361
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:05,846
And then we would develop and then sink, develop, sink.

362
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:12,773
A wonderful byproduct is that we could actually allow a measure of freedom and autonomy for

363
00:22:12,813 --> 00:22:17,836
the teams during the development cycle, during the sprints, knowing that we'd be regularly

364
00:22:17,896 --> 00:22:21,638
coming together into alignment in 12 weeks to tighten things up.

365
00:22:22,078 --> 00:22:25,701
So it reduced the amount of micromanagement every sprint.

366
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,382
It's like, no, give them freedom.

367
00:22:27,422 --> 00:22:30,183
They're getting their up, and then we get on course.

368
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:34,206
Like the analogy of a flotilla of sailboats.

369
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:37,608
You know, one goes off, you rein it back in.

370
00:22:40,534 --> 00:22:45,896
Our pitch, so the concept of PI planning in hand

371
00:22:45,976 --> 00:22:47,396
and understanding the mechanics,

372
00:22:48,016 --> 00:22:49,717
Bungee Production made the pitch

373
00:22:50,277 --> 00:22:53,278
to the Destiny 2 development teams and leadership.

374
00:22:55,238 --> 00:22:58,319
The pitch was, what if we got everybody in a room

375
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,220
at the same time, face-to-face,

376
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,721
to sync on the vision for the quarter,

377
00:23:05,201 --> 00:23:08,162
plan the team's work, identify and discuss

378
00:23:08,182 --> 00:23:09,362
and resolve dependencies?

379
00:23:12,418 --> 00:23:14,779
Bunjee's first planning day was born.

380
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:18,761
So our Epic Sync, our PI planning, we call,

381
00:23:19,821 --> 00:23:21,822
it took us a long time to come up with the term,

382
00:23:22,382 --> 00:23:23,242
planning day.

383
00:23:26,483 --> 00:23:29,244
If you try it, you can come up with something different,

384
00:23:29,865 --> 00:23:32,085
but we call it planning day and it stuck.

385
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:38,288
So as you can imagine, there was initial skepticism.

386
00:23:39,088 --> 00:23:41,549
Take the entire development team of Destiny 2.

387
00:23:42,795 --> 00:23:50,517
offline for a day. Are you kidding? It was a new idea and fairly large undertaking. It

388
00:23:50,537 --> 00:23:56,818
was a bold move. So you might be wondering, you know, how did you convince people? Well,

389
00:23:56,838 --> 00:24:01,559
there was a general recognition that the way we planned and communicated, largely through

390
00:24:01,619 --> 00:24:06,039
indirect means, was not optimal for the highly integrated development work we were doing

391
00:24:06,099 --> 00:24:12,020
on Destiny 2. So we had an idea to try that had been proven successful in other companies.

392
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:16,072
Most all were willing to try it at least once to see how it goes.

393
00:24:17,852 --> 00:24:19,433
So that's how the production worked.

394
00:24:19,493 --> 00:24:21,793
It's like, OK, let's just try it once.

395
00:24:21,853 --> 00:24:23,674
If we hate it, we'll never do it again.

396
00:24:25,334 --> 00:24:27,975
The spirit of being willing to try something bold like this

397
00:24:28,095 --> 00:24:31,436
and learn from it is one of the many things I love about working at Bungie.

398
00:24:34,716 --> 00:24:38,817
So we went from this to this.

399
00:24:39,798 --> 00:24:40,538
So what are you looking at?

400
00:24:41,173 --> 00:24:44,154
This is the table layout for a hotel ballroom.

401
00:24:46,195 --> 00:24:48,436
All of the content teams working on Destiny 2,

402
00:24:49,316 --> 00:24:52,897
300 people in the same location for a full day of planning,

403
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:56,139
and face-to-face cross-team discussion, and agreement,

404
00:24:56,619 --> 00:24:57,259
and commitment.

405
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,161
So all of those dependencies that

406
00:25:02,201 --> 00:25:05,342
were previously in people's heads, or in their notebooks,

407
00:25:05,502 --> 00:25:08,343
or free-floating anxieties.

408
00:25:09,747 --> 00:25:12,588
were converted into physical entities, post-it notes,

409
00:25:13,328 --> 00:25:15,289
gathered in a central location in the room,

410
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:20,311
what we call the dependency board, transparent to all.

411
00:25:23,792 --> 00:25:26,112
So here's, you can see where planning day occurs

412
00:25:26,152 --> 00:25:27,013
in our build cycle.

413
00:25:27,673 --> 00:25:28,833
So we had already had.

414
00:25:29,574 --> 00:25:32,237
well-established seasonal build cycle.

415
00:25:32,357 --> 00:25:34,399
As Patrick mentioned, we had winter build,

416
00:25:34,859 --> 00:25:36,040
spring build, et cetera.

417
00:25:36,521 --> 00:25:39,463
So that comes at the end of a 12-week cycle.

418
00:25:39,944 --> 00:25:42,706
So we put planning day at the beginning of the quarter,

419
00:25:43,327 --> 00:25:45,129
internal play test at the end of the quarter,

420
00:25:45,769 --> 00:25:49,473
learned from it, and then decided what we wanted to put

421
00:25:49,533 --> 00:25:52,635
on the next train going out in the next quarter

422
00:25:53,536 --> 00:25:55,078
from that, and so on, and so on.

423
00:25:59,173 --> 00:26:02,416
So if you look at the case studies about PI planning,

424
00:26:02,496 --> 00:26:05,979
you'll see that some people do it in two days.

425
00:26:06,739 --> 00:26:09,582
So they take the whole company offline for two days.

426
00:26:11,263 --> 00:26:13,605
We couldn't do that because at Bunchy,

427
00:26:13,645 --> 00:26:15,406
we have so many releases in flight,

428
00:26:15,827 --> 00:26:18,689
we couldn't take a whole team off for more than one day.

429
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:21,812
So what we did is we ended up breaking planning day

430
00:26:21,972 --> 00:26:23,513
into essentially three different steps.

431
00:26:25,096 --> 00:26:29,138
The first step is one to two weeks before we prep with the leads.

432
00:26:29,298 --> 00:26:34,140
So we have the game director and design directors get all their ducks in a row as far as what's

433
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,201
the product vision for this quarter.

434
00:26:36,901 --> 00:26:41,123
And then they talk to the area product owners, they break the epics down to features.

435
00:26:41,303 --> 00:26:44,485
The features are then given to the teams, the product owner of the teams.

436
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:49,852
And the teams talk through features, make sure they understand what they're trying to

437
00:26:49,892 --> 00:26:50,052
do.

438
00:26:50,172 --> 00:26:52,093
Also, what's their capacity for the quarter?

439
00:26:52,153 --> 00:26:55,894
You know, who they have to actually produce the work.

440
00:26:56,734 --> 00:26:57,394
So that's done.

441
00:26:57,414 --> 00:27:00,075
And then we get on site for cross-team planning day.

442
00:27:01,015 --> 00:27:06,977
And that's when we plan the sprints out, identify the dependencies, have the face-to-face conversations,

443
00:27:07,577 --> 00:27:09,317
and revise team plans and commit.

444
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:16,622
Then afterwards, you can follow up on conversations, work on stories, and also check in on the

445
00:27:16,642 --> 00:27:17,342
dependent work.

446
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:25,646
But the actual day is the focus, and we don't let anybody leave the room until we've resolved

447
00:27:26,026 --> 00:27:28,468
all of the dependencies that have been identified.

448
00:27:31,869 --> 00:27:33,830
Here's an example of our agenda.

449
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:37,032
I just thought it would be useful, a practical thing for you to have.

450
00:27:38,252 --> 00:27:40,153
Essentially, there's four parts of the day.

451
00:27:41,455 --> 00:27:44,077
The first one is welcome and goals for the day.

452
00:27:44,137 --> 00:27:47,179
So this is where the creative leads will get up and talk

453
00:27:47,239 --> 00:27:50,401
about the pillars, the goals, the vision for the quarter

454
00:27:51,722 --> 00:27:53,523
so that then the teams can figure

455
00:27:53,563 --> 00:27:57,386
out at a more granular level how their team feeds

456
00:27:57,526 --> 00:28:00,809
into those pillars and vision.

457
00:28:01,789 --> 00:28:04,731
Then we have the small teams get to just focus within their team

458
00:28:04,771 --> 00:28:07,193
and their table and do their planning for the quarter,

459
00:28:07,233 --> 00:28:08,554
make sure that they've got the.

460
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:12,210
capacity understanding and also what their scope is.

461
00:28:14,111 --> 00:28:16,052
Then comes the dependency discussions.

462
00:28:17,052 --> 00:28:22,833
Once the team has figured out essentially what they're doing, they've realized, ooh,

463
00:28:23,113 --> 00:28:24,854
we need this work from this other team.

464
00:28:25,154 --> 00:28:30,155
So this is when we now have the cross-team communication.

465
00:28:31,056 --> 00:28:35,437
And then lastly, we wrap up, share major decisions made during the day.

466
00:28:35,837 --> 00:28:37,317
So kind of bring it full circle.

467
00:28:39,789 --> 00:28:41,730
So we played with other components for the agenda.

468
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:44,032
For example, we used to have an activity

469
00:28:44,632 --> 00:28:46,673
that Henrik Nyberg put in his case study

470
00:28:46,713 --> 00:28:48,614
where the teams share their plans around the room,

471
00:28:48,654 --> 00:28:49,635
like a science fair.

472
00:28:49,995 --> 00:28:51,716
You have each of the teams have their boards

473
00:28:51,756 --> 00:28:56,859
and you go around and we just found it took too much time

474
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,281
and it wasn't super valuable for us.

475
00:28:59,501 --> 00:29:03,564
So we changed it to essentially sharing major decisions

476
00:29:03,604 --> 00:29:05,485
that were made during the day and people like that better.

477
00:29:09,655 --> 00:29:11,376
All right, so I'm going to talk you through some artifacts.

478
00:29:12,116 --> 00:29:13,397
Trying to make this really practical.

479
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:17,580
So there are four artifacts that we use for planning day.

480
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,021
The first one is the team board.

481
00:29:23,163 --> 00:29:26,485
The focal point for the team members planning out five or six

482
00:29:26,545 --> 00:29:28,106
sprints worth of work at their tables.

483
00:29:28,646 --> 00:29:31,748
It has the team name, their mission, their commitments

484
00:29:31,788 --> 00:29:35,210
for the quarter, and a place for dependency Post-it notes.

485
00:29:36,819 --> 00:29:41,583
So summary user stories then go onto the boards in the sprints

486
00:29:41,623 --> 00:29:42,904
where they're essentially slotted.

487
00:29:43,324 --> 00:29:45,106
And the team does a costing exercise,

488
00:29:45,126 --> 00:29:49,069
so they know how much, roughly, effort each of the user stories

489
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:50,150
will take.

490
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:52,592
So that's a team board.

491
00:29:52,612 --> 00:29:54,714
The second artifact is a dependency board.

492
00:29:55,935 --> 00:29:57,856
So you'll see it's a grid that has sprints

493
00:29:57,916 --> 00:30:01,039
down the left-hand side and all the teams

494
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,401
across from right to left.

495
00:30:05,031 --> 00:30:09,015
And it's a big piece of butcher paper you'll see, I'm going to show you a video,

496
00:30:09,795 --> 00:30:11,336
towards the end where you can see it in action.

497
00:30:11,356 --> 00:30:15,780
So it's a big thing of butcher paper with grid lines.

498
00:30:16,741 --> 00:30:19,123
And I actually can reuse it over and over.

499
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:24,187
And we put it in a prominent place in the planning room.

500
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:28,974
So the third artifact is electronic tracking or TFS.

501
00:30:29,034 --> 00:30:32,257
So we use Post-it Notes to help facilitate the face-to-face

502
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:35,420
communication and collaboration, because there's

503
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,201
nothing like that.

504
00:30:38,564 --> 00:30:42,488
Eventually, all the work goes into what we use, TFS, and

505
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:43,709
people might use JIRA.

506
00:30:45,018 --> 00:30:48,681
So that is the single source of truth coming out of planning day.

507
00:30:49,241 --> 00:30:55,766
And you'll see teams, we actually have monitors on each of the team tables, and you have someone

508
00:30:56,006 --> 00:30:59,930
that's inputting the items for their backlog.

509
00:31:01,411 --> 00:31:04,333
That way you don't come out of planning day feeling like you've just created a bunch of

510
00:31:04,393 --> 00:31:04,613
work.

511
00:31:05,034 --> 00:31:05,794
You get the work done.

512
00:31:07,335 --> 00:31:09,577
So last artifact is RiskBoard.

513
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:13,452
So this is how we escalate things to leadership,

514
00:31:13,492 --> 00:31:14,853
to the release leadership team.

515
00:31:17,815 --> 00:31:20,357
If there's something that teams can't figure out themselves

516
00:31:20,417 --> 00:31:22,739
in cross-team discussion, it gets put on the risk board.

517
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:26,221
And managing the risk board and resolving those risks

518
00:31:26,661 --> 00:31:29,243
is ownership of the release leadership team

519
00:31:29,323 --> 00:31:30,824
or what's called the triage team.

520
00:31:32,726 --> 00:31:34,106
Okay, so those are the artifacts.

521
00:31:35,668 --> 00:31:36,868
So I'm gonna go through the roles.

522
00:31:37,868 --> 00:31:38,688
Planning day roles.

523
00:31:39,268 --> 00:31:41,629
So this is the team structure that Patrick showed you

524
00:31:41,669 --> 00:31:43,490
yesterday, scrum master, product owner.

525
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:47,571
At Bungie, scrum masters are roughly producers, maybe more

526
00:31:47,611 --> 00:31:49,772
junior producers that do a specific team.

527
00:31:50,292 --> 00:31:54,213
Product owners are often designers, but not exclusively

528
00:31:54,253 --> 00:31:54,754
designers.

529
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:57,595
And then you have the other disciplines represented.

530
00:31:58,115 --> 00:32:01,436
So each of those teams have a table at planning day.

531
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:05,317
The product owner's role is basically

532
00:32:05,337 --> 00:32:06,858
to prioritize a team's scope.

533
00:32:07,413 --> 00:32:13,997
And they do the negotiations and the trade-offs and ultimately own the prioritization.

534
00:32:16,058 --> 00:32:19,000
And then if new work comes in, they determine, should we do it?

535
00:32:21,781 --> 00:32:26,964
The Scrum Master Producer facilitates the team planning and dependency identification.

536
00:32:28,345 --> 00:32:30,186
They drive feasibility discussions.

537
00:32:30,246 --> 00:32:34,629
So let's say new work comes in, a dependency gets put on the team, they ask, can we do

538
00:32:34,649 --> 00:32:34,689
it?

539
00:32:34,769 --> 00:32:35,990
They determine, can we do it?

540
00:32:37,228 --> 00:32:42,309
Then there's a couple of other roles that the team can self-organize to do.

541
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:47,011
We've got dependency runner, this person who brings the red post-it notes.

542
00:32:47,091 --> 00:32:49,212
We use the color red for dependency.

543
00:32:49,512 --> 00:32:52,953
So whenever you see it floating around in the room, you know it's a dependency.

544
00:32:53,793 --> 00:32:55,854
So they check the board for their team.

545
00:32:56,634 --> 00:33:01,515
Someone who manages the team board as well as someone who's entering work into TFS.

546
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,337
All right, so that's artifacts.

547
00:33:06,077 --> 00:33:08,978
the primary roles and these are the support and helper roles.

548
00:33:09,538 --> 00:33:16,340
So we have a game director and design director on site that provide clarity on vision and

549
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:16,620
pillars.

550
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:19,201
So they've given their presentation, but you know, that's great.

551
00:33:19,241 --> 00:33:24,642
You see a PowerPoint that says these are the vision, but then sometimes you have trouble

552
00:33:24,682 --> 00:33:27,023
as a team figuring out, well, how do we connect to that vision?

553
00:33:27,683 --> 00:33:29,684
The people that essentially

554
00:33:30,167 --> 00:33:34,970
own that vision are in the room so you can go right up to them and ask, how does my team,

555
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:39,614
I'm on the sandbox team, how does that feed into the vision that we have for this quarter?

556
00:33:41,195 --> 00:33:45,378
I mentioned the release leadership team, we at Bungie also call those the triage team.

557
00:33:45,719 --> 00:33:52,103
So there's a cross-discipline leadership team that is final, kind of buck stops with them

558
00:33:52,164 --> 00:33:56,087
as far as decisions on release planning and they can unblock the teams.

559
00:33:57,568 --> 00:33:59,249
The amazing value of planning day.

560
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:06,854
I just can't overstate this is the fact that you have all of the decision makers on the

561
00:34:06,874 --> 00:34:08,635
release in one room.

562
00:34:08,655 --> 00:34:15,279
I mean, imagine, you don't have to imagine, but how hard it is to get attention and decisions

563
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:19,742
made just through indirect means, through email, trying to schedule meetings with really

564
00:34:19,782 --> 00:34:20,462
busy people.

565
00:34:20,723 --> 00:34:26,266
You can get one person, but not three of them, and then you get all of this triangulation.

566
00:34:27,043 --> 00:34:29,365
At planning day, you have everybody in the room.

567
00:34:29,465 --> 00:34:33,768
So we even had one team report that they had an issue that was lingering

568
00:34:34,109 --> 00:34:35,149
for literally two months.

569
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:39,213
They got into planning day, had all the decision makers there,

570
00:34:39,553 --> 00:34:41,194
they got it done in 10 minutes.

571
00:34:41,995 --> 00:34:43,116
It's very efficient.

572
00:34:44,737 --> 00:34:47,800
People think, oh my God, it's not efficient to get all these people in a room.

573
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,561
It's more efficient, trust me.

574
00:34:52,283 --> 00:34:56,066
And then there's the agility coach or the chief scrum master, that's me.

575
00:34:58,711 --> 00:35:04,012
You'll see me in action in the video I'm going to show later in this presentation.

576
00:35:04,372 --> 00:35:05,313
So I'm like a sheriff.

577
00:35:05,673 --> 00:35:11,034
I don't let anybody out of the room until all the dependencies have a resolved sticker on it.

578
00:35:11,794 --> 00:35:12,695
I chase them down.

579
00:35:12,715 --> 00:35:19,296
All right. We talked through the artifacts, the agenda, the roles.

580
00:35:19,957 --> 00:35:24,078
I now wanted to illustrate how one user story or...

581
00:35:25,019 --> 00:35:27,240
dependency might move through planning day.

582
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:34,022
So that way, I've given you all these kind of explanations, but now I just want to show

583
00:35:34,062 --> 00:35:38,784
you if we take a user story, how does it move through planning day and how do we use artifacts

584
00:35:39,944 --> 00:35:41,265
to get the work committed to?

585
00:35:42,745 --> 00:35:50,448
So I wanted to use a user story that would relate to Destiny 2 campaign.

586
00:35:50,468 --> 00:35:53,689
We had something called Zavala's Ward of Dawn.

587
00:35:54,165 --> 00:35:58,368
which was this in-game vignette that was really complex.

588
00:35:58,408 --> 00:36:00,069
It wasn't an external vignette.

589
00:36:00,369 --> 00:36:01,670
It was an in-game vignette.

590
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:03,972
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you the sequence

591
00:36:04,672 --> 00:36:06,393
as the player experiences it.

592
00:36:06,894 --> 00:36:08,975
And then we'll break it down and see

593
00:36:09,035 --> 00:36:12,397
how this collaboration worked to make this possible.

594
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:15,159
This is the really loud one.

595
00:36:15,179 --> 00:36:16,200
Incoming!

596
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,261
Fall back to my team!

597
00:36:26,818 --> 00:36:32,204
So in that you noticed that you were just you're shooting cabal at the

598
00:36:32,324 --> 00:36:36,208
opening campaign then all of a sudden Zavala starts talking and then he

599
00:36:36,548 --> 00:36:42,354
spreads his bubble shield and you have the cabal coming at you and their

600
00:36:42,414 --> 00:36:44,536
missiles are being deflected by that shield.

601
00:36:47,328 --> 00:36:48,568
Why is it so complicated?

602
00:36:48,728 --> 00:36:54,329
So the campaign team would normally be able to take care of most everything within their campaign,

603
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:59,851
but that required in-game play adjustments.

604
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:03,951
So there were individual adjustments that had to be made,

605
00:37:04,012 --> 00:37:06,632
as well as game objectives that were impacted.

606
00:37:07,472 --> 00:37:12,693
So that required them to basically be dependent.

607
00:37:13,402 --> 00:37:16,023
on what we call the NPC team or the vignette team.

608
00:37:16,563 --> 00:37:20,706
So in order to execute on this, they needed help,

609
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:24,988
very clear help from the NPC and vignette team.

610
00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:29,570
So how would this user story and its dependencies

611
00:37:29,651 --> 00:37:31,031
be managed during planning day?

612
00:37:36,054 --> 00:37:38,535
All right, so let's say this is the campaign team.

613
00:37:38,876 --> 00:37:41,117
They're at their table, they've got their team board,

614
00:37:41,137 --> 00:37:43,038
they've got their backlog.

615
00:37:43,701 --> 00:37:46,023
So they had a campaign team.

616
00:37:47,204 --> 00:37:49,146
We build the first six missions of the game.

617
00:37:49,186 --> 00:37:49,966
That's their mission.

618
00:37:51,428 --> 00:37:53,469
So what they do is they create a sticky note

619
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:57,172
for the user story, for the overall experience.

620
00:37:57,753 --> 00:38:00,375
And using the user story format, we do it

621
00:38:00,415 --> 00:38:01,596
from the player's perspective.

622
00:38:02,237 --> 00:38:04,919
So as a player, when I clear the enemies in the tower,

623
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,762
Zavala's protective ward of dawn is triggered.

624
00:38:08,762 --> 00:38:11,325
So that's the end player experience.

625
00:38:12,338 --> 00:38:15,441
So though the campaign team is responsible for the overall experience,

626
00:38:15,481 --> 00:38:20,305
Award of Dawn, Bubble Shield itself is created by the NPC vignettes team,

627
00:38:20,345 --> 00:38:20,965
not their team.

628
00:38:21,005 --> 00:38:24,789
So they create a physical dependency in the form of a red post-it note.

629
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:29,052
To NPC team, from campaign team.

630
00:38:30,013 --> 00:38:32,075
And they'd say what sprint they would like it in.

631
00:38:35,578 --> 00:38:38,120
Okay, then the dependency runner from the team.

632
00:38:39,665 --> 00:38:41,685
which is considered the requesting team,

633
00:38:41,745 --> 00:38:43,206
goes to the dependency board,

634
00:38:43,626 --> 00:38:48,128
puts the post-it note into the column for NPCs

635
00:38:48,408 --> 00:38:49,648
and in the sprint that they wanted.

636
00:38:49,688 --> 00:38:50,849
So it would look something like this.

637
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:53,790
The requesting team would add the post-it note

638
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:55,350
in the NPC column.

639
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:57,451
They want it sprint six.

640
00:38:59,772 --> 00:39:01,632
So the providing team then checks the board

641
00:39:01,812 --> 00:39:03,073
and picks up the dependency.

642
00:39:08,222 --> 00:39:15,084
The main job of the Post-it note, the Post-it note artifact, I as an Agile coach, you know,

643
00:39:15,284 --> 00:39:17,345
Agile coaches love Post-it notes.

644
00:39:19,926 --> 00:39:26,648
But they're really useful because so much that we do as knowledge workers is invisible.

645
00:39:27,389 --> 00:39:31,590
So Post-it note actually makes a thing, makes a physical thing of a thought.

646
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:35,372
And then that physical thing comes into being and then you have to deal with it.

647
00:39:35,997 --> 00:39:40,680
And in this case, in planning day, it basically gets handed around,

648
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:44,102
and it actually represents a conversation that needs to happen.

649
00:39:44,443 --> 00:39:46,364
And eventually, it represents a commitment.

650
00:39:47,445 --> 00:39:51,908
So the main job of Post-it Note artifacts is to drive a conversation.

651
00:39:52,528 --> 00:39:53,489
It's very effective.

652
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:57,852
So driving conversations and bringing them to resolution

653
00:39:57,892 --> 00:39:59,333
is the main point of planning day.

654
00:40:00,394 --> 00:40:02,936
As someone said to me, the process and the ritual

655
00:40:03,915 --> 00:40:06,437
is a way to engineer human proximity.

656
00:40:07,217 --> 00:40:07,878
I really like that.

657
00:40:08,998 --> 00:40:11,480
We were engineering human proximity.

658
00:40:13,141 --> 00:40:16,783
So engineering human proximity would provide just

659
00:40:16,823 --> 00:40:18,724
a lightweight structure, some tools,

660
00:40:19,645 --> 00:40:23,987
to more efficiently get problems solved face to face.

661
00:40:25,288 --> 00:40:26,929
Alistair Coburn.

662
00:40:27,554 --> 00:40:30,336
coined the phrase osmotic communication.

663
00:40:30,416 --> 00:40:33,777
So it's communication through osmosis, through proximity.

664
00:40:34,818 --> 00:40:36,138
So here we have, in this picture,

665
00:40:36,158 --> 00:40:38,560
we have a producer at the dependency board

666
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:40,281
talking to a member of the UI team

667
00:40:40,481 --> 00:40:41,681
who happens to be in this room.

668
00:40:43,702 --> 00:40:45,923
And there are other members of the team in proximity,

669
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:48,325
you know, tuning in or tuning out as needed.

670
00:40:50,306 --> 00:40:53,307
These are quality two-way conversations that happen.

671
00:40:54,988 --> 00:40:56,649
They might not, they might otherwise.

672
00:40:57,176 --> 00:41:00,178
get lost in emails, or not even happen at all.

673
00:41:05,302 --> 00:41:09,966
So after the conversation between the campaign and the MPC team, the red dependency note

674
00:41:09,986 --> 00:41:15,890
is then brought back to the providing team, considered and placed on their backlog.

675
00:41:16,671 --> 00:41:18,613
Okay, so then we go to the providing team.

676
00:41:18,873 --> 00:41:19,693
This is their backlog.

677
00:41:24,347 --> 00:41:30,250
and they do a costing exercise and they're able to actually accommodate it.

678
00:41:32,271 --> 00:41:38,035
Put it into their electronic backlog, which is the ultimate source of truth.

679
00:41:38,455 --> 00:41:40,356
The work is a thing.

680
00:41:40,856 --> 00:41:42,157
The work is on their backlog.

681
00:41:42,637 --> 00:41:43,298
It will get done.

682
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:52,663
So the dependency sticky is then brought back to the board and then a notice added resolved.

683
00:41:53,667 --> 00:41:59,188
So this might be kind of silly to you, but we actually learned it's seriously,

684
00:41:59,228 --> 00:42:04,509
it's really helpful to have a physical thing that says something is resolved.

685
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:09,070
Because we open up so many of these issues that we need to deal with.

686
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:13,311
We wanna close some that we have, so we have some more cognitive capacity.

687
00:42:13,971 --> 00:42:17,252
So it's really important to market resolve, get that closure.

688
00:42:17,892 --> 00:42:20,912
And what it says to everybody else is that there's a commitment that was made.

689
00:42:20,972 --> 00:42:22,873
So it's a public way to make a commitment.

690
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:27,411
Literally, we can't leave the room until all the dependencies are resolved,

691
00:42:27,571 --> 00:42:30,473
either resolved by the other team accommodating the work,

692
00:42:30,953 --> 00:42:32,675
or if they can't accommodate the work,

693
00:42:32,795 --> 00:42:36,317
the future work of that team is then adjusted,

694
00:42:36,577 --> 00:42:38,078
and the expectations are adjusted.

695
00:42:38,619 --> 00:42:41,381
So the intricate player experience, the in-game,

696
00:42:41,401 --> 00:42:46,664
a word of Don Vignac can now be worked on by two teams in parallel,

697
00:42:47,165 --> 00:42:49,166
and that coordination is set up at planning day,

698
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:53,309
making rich, intricate Destiny 2 experiences like this possible.

699
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:54,271
Incoming!

700
00:42:54,291 --> 00:42:57,512
Fall back to my team!

701
00:42:57,532 --> 00:43:02,094
More refugees!

702
00:43:02,114 --> 00:43:02,914
More refugees!

703
00:43:08,176 --> 00:43:13,038
OK, last bit of this and then I'm going to show you a video.

704
00:43:14,419 --> 00:43:16,380
So, complex problem solving at planning day.

705
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:19,521
So I just described what can be considered the golden path.

706
00:43:20,581 --> 00:43:22,762
The team realized they needed help.

707
00:43:24,494 --> 00:43:27,297
They talked to the other team, they had a conversation, they understood it, they cost

708
00:43:27,357 --> 00:43:28,778
it and they were able to accommodate.

709
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:33,083
But what happens when things come up and the teams can't agree?

710
00:43:33,163 --> 00:43:37,327
Maybe there is a difference of opinion on what is a priority.

711
00:43:39,289 --> 00:43:42,032
So what happens in this case if the teams can't sort it out?

712
00:43:42,512 --> 00:43:46,836
So let's say the MPC vignette team says, we're all full.

713
00:43:47,295 --> 00:43:48,456
There's no room at the inn.

714
00:43:48,616 --> 00:43:50,017
We can't do your ward of dawn.

715
00:43:50,478 --> 00:43:52,600
But the requesting team feels that the ward of dawn

716
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:53,681
is really important.

717
00:43:54,121 --> 00:43:54,741
So they're stuck.

718
00:43:55,502 --> 00:43:57,664
Well, as I said, what's unique about planning day

719
00:43:58,124 --> 00:44:00,427
is we have all of the decision makers in one room.

720
00:44:00,787 --> 00:44:03,950
And trade-offs can be discussed and decided right there

721
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:04,570
on the spot.

722
00:44:05,871 --> 00:44:09,234
So in case of an issue, then the dependency

723
00:44:09,254 --> 00:44:10,415
goes to the risk board.

724
00:44:10,656 --> 00:44:11,757
So I mentioned the risk board.

725
00:44:12,919 --> 00:44:18,522
You'll notice in proximity the release triage team is right next to the risk board.

726
00:44:18,562 --> 00:44:23,565
Their job is to look at the risk board and when something comes in, they jump on it in

727
00:44:23,585 --> 00:44:26,587
that wonderful servant leadership mindset.

728
00:44:28,808 --> 00:44:34,712
So then they talk to both teams and they understand the trade-offs and priorities and make a decision.

729
00:44:35,727 --> 00:44:40,852
So it goes to them if sometimes there might be some follow-up discussion needed,

730
00:44:41,252 --> 00:44:46,216
but it's considered resolved because somebody on leadership owns solving that issue.

731
00:44:48,918 --> 00:44:49,979
So those are the mechanics.

732
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:52,902
The dynamic ritual called planning day,

733
00:44:53,923 --> 00:44:55,824
the agenda, the roles, the artifacts,

734
00:44:56,565 --> 00:44:57,926
an illustration of how it works.

735
00:44:59,247 --> 00:45:01,249
Do you want to see Bungie's planning day in action?

736
00:45:14,857 --> 00:45:18,060
We've seen a ton of positive outcomes from doing planning days here at Bungie.

737
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:22,284
We have hundreds and hundreds of people at Bungie all working in all sorts of different disciplines and teams.

738
00:45:22,764 --> 00:45:28,890
And even with their best intentions, they can run afoul of assuming that other teams are doing work that they are counting on.

739
00:45:30,411 --> 00:45:39,299
Having everyone sit in one room and really work through their problems so that you can come out of a day with a really clear understanding of what your team is doing and what all your team needs to focus on.

740
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:41,001
Yeah, yeah, yeah. We're going to do Tantrums.

741
00:45:49,981 --> 00:45:59,086
It requires them to go and talk to their teammates and figure out what they need to do and really

742
00:45:59,106 --> 00:46:00,506
make sure that the problem is fully solved.

743
00:46:01,807 --> 00:46:05,549
And then we've instituted things like making sure they're resolved so there's that follow-up.

744
00:46:06,184 --> 00:46:10,645
And so it's exposed it to the leadership, to their team, to every other team.

745
00:46:10,665 --> 00:46:12,146
It really does increase that accountability.

746
00:46:12,166 --> 00:46:14,947
You're really challenging yourself to ask the question of,

747
00:46:15,107 --> 00:46:17,548
is the students doing this? Does everyone know about it?

748
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:24,971
You come out of this understanding your priorities

749
00:46:25,191 --> 00:46:27,152
and really challenging yourself to see what you can build.

750
00:46:27,692 --> 00:46:31,033
Those people can then go out of this day with a really clear mandate

751
00:46:31,093 --> 00:46:32,414
about what they're doing the next day.

752
00:46:33,045 --> 00:46:37,347
The rancor that you add by really forcing yourself to drill down and ask tough questions

753
00:46:37,367 --> 00:46:40,949
can allow for the project to be better scoped and ultimately more successful.

754
00:47:06,334 --> 00:47:08,475
Yay, dependencies resolved.

755
00:47:10,517 --> 00:47:11,218
Celebrate.

756
00:47:11,318 --> 00:47:12,099
You celebrate.

757
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:16,442
All right, so I just want to wrap up

758
00:47:16,482 --> 00:47:19,985
with a few additional slides and then some lessons learned.

759
00:47:20,646 --> 00:47:23,508
And then I'd be happy to answer questions in the overflow area

760
00:47:23,869 --> 00:47:24,309
afterwards.

761
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:27,312
So you may be wondering, how do we keep tabs

762
00:47:27,372 --> 00:47:29,634
on these dependencies after planning day?

763
00:47:29,654 --> 00:47:30,715
Because everyone gets excited.

764
00:47:30,735 --> 00:47:32,296
You can see they're collaborating and having fun.

765
00:47:32,336 --> 00:47:34,278
And then it's like, OK, where did the dependency go?

766
00:47:35,004 --> 00:47:40,287
Well, it's in their backlog, but it's tracked separately

767
00:47:40,367 --> 00:47:43,069
with a midpoint check-in we call dependency check-in.

768
00:47:43,469 --> 00:47:45,190
So this is done on-site at Bungie.

769
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:46,611
We have a conference room you'll see here.

770
00:47:47,051 --> 00:47:49,592
We have teams set up in different parts of the room.

771
00:47:50,133 --> 00:47:55,195
And you come there, you prepare basically the product

772
00:47:55,236 --> 00:47:57,837
owners and the producers only, so we don't have the full

773
00:47:57,877 --> 00:47:58,557
teams there.

774
00:47:59,138 --> 00:48:01,359
We prepare to check in on dependent work.

775
00:48:01,539 --> 00:48:03,640
Go around the room, have conversations you need.

776
00:48:04,451 --> 00:48:09,796
And your team is done when those depending on you

777
00:48:09,856 --> 00:48:11,258
have gotten what they need from the sink.

778
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:13,159
So we actually do this ritual where

779
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:14,160
you're about to leave the room.

780
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,523
It's like, OK, I'm on the combatants team.

781
00:48:16,583 --> 00:48:17,764
Anybody need to talk to me?

782
00:48:18,505 --> 00:48:19,466
No, OK, I'm leaving.

783
00:48:19,606 --> 00:48:20,567
Or yes, I do.

784
00:48:21,107 --> 00:48:24,230
So it's really an agreement between the people in the room

785
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:26,753
that they get what they need out of dependency check-in.

786
00:48:28,294 --> 00:48:28,795
So we've

787
00:48:29,988 --> 00:48:36,052
done this almost 12 or 13 times now with many different releases and we've

788
00:48:36,092 --> 00:48:41,015
tweaked it. We've never done it the same way twice but it always has the same

789
00:48:41,095 --> 00:48:45,918
elements as I said those basic elements of planning and dependency resolution

790
00:48:47,279 --> 00:48:51,262
but we played with some things I wanted to share you share with you what we

791
00:48:51,282 --> 00:48:54,964
learned. So one of the things is how much prep do you do? How much prep do the

792
00:48:55,004 --> 00:48:58,747
teams do? Because you have that that part of the agenda where the teams get to

793
00:48:59,278 --> 00:49:02,781
actually work together and plan out.

794
00:49:02,821 --> 00:49:06,985
So the first time we didn't do that much prep,

795
00:49:07,786 --> 00:49:10,168
and then we overcompensated the next time,

796
00:49:10,248 --> 00:49:12,670
and the product owners did all the planning

797
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:14,352
and the teams felt left out,

798
00:49:14,452 --> 00:49:16,754
so we then just had to loosen it.

799
00:49:16,814 --> 00:49:18,275
So it's like Goldilocks.

800
00:49:19,136 --> 00:49:21,198
It's too hot, too cold, just right.

801
00:49:22,953 --> 00:49:26,135
Wrap up, how to share out the team's plans efficiently.

802
00:49:26,555 --> 00:49:27,855
So you have all the teams, the plan,

803
00:49:27,895 --> 00:49:29,456
how do you get that visibility?

804
00:49:29,576 --> 00:49:32,397
It is in TFS, but that's not really effective.

805
00:49:32,877 --> 00:49:33,898
So at first, as I said,

806
00:49:33,918 --> 00:49:36,399
we tried that team science fair format,

807
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:41,261
but it just was unuseful.

808
00:49:41,441 --> 00:49:43,441
But what we did is we brought those team boards back

809
00:49:43,521 --> 00:49:45,982
and we would display them back at Bungie

810
00:49:46,062 --> 00:49:48,263
so that anybody that wanted to actually look deeper

811
00:49:48,984 --> 00:49:51,785
into the team's scope for that quarter could.

812
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:56,636
Do all team members have to stay for the entire day?

813
00:49:57,657 --> 00:50:01,642
Getting an artist to stay in a room planning for a whole day

814
00:50:01,662 --> 00:50:03,223
is not the easiest thing.

815
00:50:04,404 --> 00:50:07,247
So while people really saw the value,

816
00:50:09,390 --> 00:50:12,533
it was important when we first did it, we had mandatory.

817
00:50:12,653 --> 00:50:13,874
All the teams have to show up.

818
00:50:14,608 --> 00:50:17,649
We gave them snacks and food, so, you know, made it worth their while.

819
00:50:18,109 --> 00:50:20,610
But once we did it, people saw the value.

820
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:25,031
So it was not as much of a hard sell after that.

821
00:50:25,511 --> 00:50:28,352
But what we've done is we allow the teams to self-organize.

822
00:50:28,912 --> 00:50:33,674
They can determine who needs to be there for the dependencies check-in section.

823
00:50:35,775 --> 00:50:40,056
So I really recommend if you do this, gather data after every planning day.

824
00:50:40,756 --> 00:50:43,617
This is something that you'll want to continually refine and reflect.

825
00:50:44,015 --> 00:50:47,696
So I use SurveyMonkey, send out SurveyMonkeys.

826
00:50:48,036 --> 00:50:50,957
Here's an example of one recently.

827
00:50:51,697 --> 00:50:53,298
Crossing planning day, was it valuable

828
00:50:53,318 --> 00:50:56,219
in gaining crossing visibility and identifying dependencies?

829
00:50:56,599 --> 00:51:00,400
So we have roughly like 89% said yes.

830
00:51:02,521 --> 00:51:04,801
Also, does your team have a winter build plan

831
00:51:04,841 --> 00:51:05,602
that they believe in?

832
00:51:05,622 --> 00:51:07,982
Because that's what we want to come out with.

833
00:51:08,002 --> 00:51:09,103
Do you have a plan that you believe in?

834
00:51:09,243 --> 00:51:09,763
I can't believe it.

835
00:51:10,563 --> 00:51:11,203
I can't believe it.

836
00:51:11,243 --> 00:51:11,604
90% said yes.

837
00:51:13,477 --> 00:51:18,661
So that confidence that they're exuding, we have confidence in our plans.

838
00:51:20,863 --> 00:51:23,745
Briefly, many configurations of planning day.

839
00:51:23,805 --> 00:51:29,929
We've done large off-site, mid-off-site, mixed off-site, on-site, and all on-site.

840
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:34,973
So you can do this, you know, if you have a big room at your studio.

841
00:51:35,734 --> 00:51:40,157
There is a value in taking people off-site, so I'd really recommend trying that first

842
00:51:40,317 --> 00:51:42,839
because then people are away from their...

843
00:51:43,553 --> 00:51:44,313
workstations.

844
00:51:47,735 --> 00:51:50,677
OK, so I wanted to just recap here, and then I'll give you

845
00:51:50,697 --> 00:51:52,478
some takeaways, and then we'll be done.

846
00:51:53,379 --> 00:51:56,161
Planning day ritual, what did we gain?

847
00:51:56,481 --> 00:51:58,582
So we saw a positive effect.

848
00:51:59,063 --> 00:52:01,544
Our first major winter build, after the first two planning

849
00:52:01,584 --> 00:52:05,747
days, had more complete work in it than we had previously.

850
00:52:06,968 --> 00:52:10,210
So we had regular alignment with all the teams, with the

851
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:11,270
product vision and pillars.

852
00:52:12,656 --> 00:52:17,419
What we got from planning day, we had dependent work identified and tracked for the first time.

853
00:52:18,959 --> 00:52:22,581
We had authentic cross-team commitments made face-to-face, so we did

854
00:52:22,621 --> 00:52:26,764
that human proximity engineering to get those commitments face-to-face.

855
00:52:27,084 --> 00:52:31,306
And there's nothing like someone, there's nothing like the combatants team telling,

856
00:52:31,586 --> 00:52:35,128
or the, you know, the visual effects team telling the combatants team,

857
00:52:35,168 --> 00:52:36,449
you're going to get that effect.

858
00:52:36,869 --> 00:52:41,092
Like face-to-face, there's something that increases the accountability.

859
00:52:42,193 --> 00:52:44,655
And it's efficient and transparent decision-making

860
00:52:45,535 --> 00:52:48,136
with the decisions reported out to everybody.

861
00:52:49,257 --> 00:52:51,478
All told, it increases the predictability.

862
00:52:51,738 --> 00:52:53,319
Now we know better what we're getting

863
00:52:53,339 --> 00:52:55,360
at the end of the quarter in our quarterly build

864
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:58,641
and our agility, our ability to pivot if need be.

865
00:53:02,343 --> 00:53:04,884
This was a quote from our D2 team retrospective.

866
00:53:05,124 --> 00:53:07,665
Planning days are now a vital part of shipping our games.

867
00:53:09,306 --> 00:53:10,787
Actually, it had an expletive in there,

868
00:53:10,827 --> 00:53:11,647
but I had to take it out.

869
00:53:13,932 --> 00:53:15,113
Fucking awesome!

870
00:53:18,536 --> 00:53:20,297
Key takeaways I want to leave you with.

871
00:53:22,479 --> 00:53:26,762
The first one is as your game grows in size and complexity,

872
00:53:27,362 --> 00:53:31,145
the benefits of well-designed, well-executed sync rituals are huge.

873
00:53:32,706 --> 00:53:36,669
So whatever your size and complexity, whatever that growth is,

874
00:53:37,209 --> 00:53:39,992
whether it's from 5 people to 10 people, or 10 people to 50,

875
00:53:44,448 --> 00:53:48,011
Never underestimate the value and impact of face-to-face communication.

876
00:53:49,151 --> 00:53:53,354
Do not use size as an excuse not to talk face-to-face.

877
00:53:53,634 --> 00:53:55,335
I think that's the biggest takeaway.

878
00:53:55,655 --> 00:54:01,979
You can engineer really efficient face-to-face communication with dependent teams.

879
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:07,042
Spending a whole day planning feels like a huge investment, but it's well worth it.

880
00:54:07,982 --> 00:54:08,563
Be bold.

881
00:54:08,863 --> 00:54:13,826
Take a bold action to get your team synchronized.

882
00:54:14,398 --> 00:54:17,039
And lastly, don't get complacent.

883
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:19,780
Continuously inspect and adapt.

884
00:54:21,501 --> 00:54:23,562
Listen to the benefits.

885
00:54:24,842 --> 00:54:26,843
Measure the benefits of planning day.

886
00:54:27,903 --> 00:54:32,385
Measure people's engagement, how you can make it better.

887
00:54:32,485 --> 00:54:34,726
Like we do surveys, and somebody said,

888
00:54:35,366 --> 00:54:37,127
no more oatmeal cookies.

889
00:54:37,147 --> 00:54:38,207
It's like, OK.

890
00:54:39,208 --> 00:54:41,629
Now we know, let's make chocolate chip cookies.

891
00:54:41,709 --> 00:54:44,010
So there's lots of stuff that will help you

892
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:45,591
reduce your blind spots.

893
00:54:48,252 --> 00:54:48,632
That's it.

894
00:54:48,912 --> 00:54:50,593
My hope is that you take something away from this

895
00:54:50,633 --> 00:54:54,475
that you find useful or inspiring to try and experiment

896
00:54:54,795 --> 00:54:57,336
with in your own studios, whatever the size,

897
00:54:57,736 --> 00:54:59,377
to keep your teams synchronized.

898
00:55:00,598 --> 00:55:00,918
Thank you.
